# Tennessee's Opponents Likely to Regret Return of Gene McEver, High Scoring Leader of U.S. in 1929
## 
### 
Gene McEver of Tennessee wns a j
! big star in 1929, but hurt his knee
1 a little more than a year ago and
! so didn't pUiy at all in 1930. Now
this fine ball-carrier is back, and
! Alabama, North Carolina, Duke,
! Vanderbilt, and Kentucky are likely
j to be sorry. The Volunteers expect
to carry on where they left off last
year, when they lost only to that
I rough, tough Alabama outfit.
Old Man Graduation has plucked
i Bobby Dodd, one of the greatest of
I all Southern quarterbacks, and
i Buddy Hackman, who with McEver,
! formed the famous team of "Hack
land Mack" in 1929, from the ranks
i of the Vol's, but "Gene the Genius"
I McEver is back this year to make

, i( the fans forget Dodd and Hackman.
Eugene McEver was the high
scoring leader in the country in
i 1529, which means practically noth
| ing because of the weak character
of the opposition encountered in
certain games (Tennessee 73, Car
son-Newman 0, for instance) but the
fact that McEver scored 21 touch
downs that season is interesting,
| nevertheless. When Gene just took
the oval and galloped goalwards
with it, there was nothing to it. In
fact you might say "He did it with
'E's," as there are five E's in his
1 own name and four more in Tennes
see. But maybe the aforementioned
: Bama, North Carolina, Duke, Vandy,
and Kentucky won't make it so easy
1 ; for him this year!
