The St. Mary's-Sanla Clara foot
j ball classic at Kezar Sunday not
] only steals the grid show from the
I coast conference this week but also
| promises to be the best ''Little Big
j Game" in years.
The Gaels are believed by many
: to be headed toward the possibility
of a claim on national honors, hav
j ing conquered all of their opponents
i thus far including U.S.C. and Cali
j fornia. And Bronco supporters arc
; equally convinced that Santa Clara
j is the only team that can stop this
j march.
Although the Broncos have
lost two games and have been
tied once this year, their record
j is nothing to be ashamed of.
They lost their initial contest to
California fi to 2, their second
j to Stanford (> to 0, and were re
cently held to a scoreless tie by
an improved West Coast Army
outfit. But in all of these games
! Clipper Smith's warriors have
j given their rivals a real scare.
On the other hand, Slip Madigan's
| Gaels have done nothing startling
| since their victories over the Tro
| jans and the Bears. They seem to
I have been gradually slipping ever
| since these two encounters. Last
Sunday they were nearly beaten by
the Gonzaga Bulldogs.
So if Paglia's toe is as keen
as it was in the first half of the
Card-Bronco tilt, the Galloping
Gaels may find themselves
preventing punts from being
| blocked behind the goal line.

Howard Jones has scheduled no
contest for his Trojans this week.
The U.S.C. mentor will therefore be
j in the Stanford Stadium to person
| ally scout the Indians.
I Evidently Jones is profiting by the

| experiences of Pop Warner in leav
ing his Cards on the farm to win :
, "breathers" while he personally I
j scouted the California Bears. The |
I Cards did not always win these |
1 "breathers."
Jones will be able to sit in the
stands and watch the Indians
perform without being forced to
coach via Western Union. May
lie he will bring his whole team
np to view the Cards. j
I
With the Trojans idle and the
Bears using their "shock troops"
■ against the Nevada wolf pack at
I Berkeley, there is only one confer
i cnce team with an important game I
this week. That team is Oregon,
j Doc Spears' Webfooters are back in
New York where they will meet
N.Y.U. Saturday in an important j
I tilt:.
In i')2R it will he remembered
Oregon State invaded New York
and trounced the Violets in a !
huge upset by a score of 2(! to
J2. And a few days later Stan
ford humbled the Army 2(> to 0
on the same field, the Yankee |
1 Stadium.
But no one gives the Webfeet
a chance to repeat the accom
plishment of the Oregon State
Beavers. N.Y.U. this year is
rated the best team in the East
and with tlie 1928 game still in
their minds, they will be that
much harder to down.

The Gaels are believed by many
: to be headed toward the possibility
of a claim on national honors, hav
j ing conquered all of their opponents
i thus far including U.S.C. and Cali
j fornia. And Bronco supporters arc
; equally convinced that Santa Clara
j is the only team that can stop this
j march.
Although the Broncos have
lost two games and have been
tied once this year, their record
j is nothing to be ashamed of.
They lost their initial contest to
California fi to 2, their second
j to Stanford (> to 0, and were re
cently held to a scoreless tie by
an improved West Coast Army
outfit. But in all of these games
! Clipper Smith's warriors have
j given their rivals a real scare.
On the other hand, Slip Madigan's
| Gaels have done nothing startling
| since their victories over the Tro
| jans and the Bears. They seem to
I have been gradually slipping ever
| since these two encounters. Last
Sunday they were nearly beaten by
the Gonzaga Bulldogs.
So if Paglia's toe is as keen
as it was in the first half of the
Card-Bronco tilt, the Galloping
Gaels may find themselves
preventing punts from being
| blocked behind the goal line.

Howard Jones has scheduled no
contest for his Trojans this week.
The U.S.C. mentor will therefore be
j in the Stanford Stadium to person
| ally scout the Indians.
I Evidently Jones is profiting by the

| experiences of Pop Warner in leav
ing his Cards on the farm to win :
, "breathers" while he personally I
j scouted the California Bears. The |
I Cards did not always win these |
1 "breathers."
Jones will be able to sit in the
stands and watch the Indians
perform without being forced to
coach via Western Union. May
lie he will bring his whole team
np to view the Cards. j
I
With the Trojans idle and the
Bears using their "shock troops"
■ against the Nevada wolf pack at
I Berkeley, there is only one confer
i cnce team with an important game I
this week. That team is Oregon,
j Doc Spears' Webfooters are back in
New York where they will meet
N.Y.U. Saturday in an important j
I tilt:.
In i')2R it will he remembered
Oregon State invaded New York
and trounced the Violets in a !
huge upset by a score of 2(! to
J2. And a few days later Stan
ford humbled the Army 2(> to 0
on the same field, the Yankee |
1 Stadium.
But no one gives the Webfeet
a chance to repeat the accom
plishment of the Oregon State
Beavers. N.Y.U. this year is
rated the best team in the East
and with tlie 1928 game still in
their minds, they will be that
much harder to down.
