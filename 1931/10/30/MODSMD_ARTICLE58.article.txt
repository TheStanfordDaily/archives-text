# INJURIES CRIPPLE FROSH SQUAD FOR MORAN STRUGGLE
## Van Kirk, Kahn, Flannagan And Keller Definitely Out Of Play 
### Francis Hamilton 
With a host of first-string men
off form on account of injuries, the
Stanford freshman grid team will
lake the field against Moran School
at 12 noon tomorrow in the stadium.
No less than seven of the men
who started last Saturday against
the U.S.C. Trobabes are on the
crippled list this week. They in
clude Lettunich, Keller, Semmel
roth, Mottram, Kahn,, Flannagan,
and Van Kirk. Of these men, Sem
melroth, Mottram, and Lettunich
are expected to start the contest,
but their lasting qualities in their
present weakened condition are
problematical.
Keller and Van Kirk possibly are
out for the lemainder of the season.
Second String In
The large hospital list requires a

general scrambling of the team. In j
the absence of the regulars a num- j
ber of second-string men will have j
a chance to show what they can do
under fire in a game.
Seaver will be moved up to Flan
nagan's place at fullback where he
will have the assignment of backing \
up the line on defense. Moore shifts j
over from his accustomed post at j
right half to assume Seaver's duties j
at full. Moore opened the season at I
this latter position so the new work I
will not be strange to him. Flippen,
who plays a neat game at defensive
halfback, will begin the contest in :
Moore's position. Flippen is a hard, ]
clean tackier; more of his defensive i
tactics will not hurt the Indian
team's appearance. Neither Bowles
nor Rothert is in the best of con- !
dition, but Bowles is expected to !
start at left half.
Bates at Center
In the line Bates will replace Van j
Kirk at center, with Mottram and j
Semmelroth opening at guards. Sav
age takes the injured Keller's post
at left tackle and will pair with
Lettunich in these strategic posi
tions. Allen and Abrahamson com
plete the lineup at ends.
