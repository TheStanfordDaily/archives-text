# TRACKSTERS ENGAGE IN WEEKLY PRACTICE MINUS LES HABLES
## 
### 
Minus one of their stars, Les
Hables, who is still in the hospital
recovering from an appendicitis
operation, the Stanford tracksters
will engage in another weekly prac
tice meet this afternoon, running
% distances in all events except the
sprints and hurdles.
Ben Eastman, who has been train
ing in the 100- and 220-yard dashes
during the fall, will again compete
in the sprints this afternoon. Ben
has run his favorite race, the 440,
cnly once this season, and was
clocked in 48.2 seconds.
With Les Hables in the hospital,
his brother, Captain Ike Hables, will
be favored to win the 352-yard
event today. Ike won a heat in this
race last week but did not equal the
fast time of 40.1 set by Les a few
minutes later.
In the weight events John Lyman
is again expected to win the shot,
while A1 Hay will easily win the
javelin event.
In the pole vault Johns and
Wheeler will be probably fighting
for first. Johns is a slight favorite,
havnig cleared 12 feet 6 inches al
ready this season.
