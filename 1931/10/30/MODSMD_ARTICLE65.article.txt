# GRAYS TO TACKLE S.F.U. TOMORROW
## Cuddeback Plans To Test Large Number Of Men Against Visitors 
### 
Stanford Grays versus San Fran
cisco University 011 the Grays' field
at 10 o'clock Saturday morning.
There is a contest that Farm foot
ball fans should watch with inter
est, for a crew of Stanford un
knowns will be battling for recogni
tion and a possible berth on "Pop"
Warner's 1932 varsity squad.
Coach Murray Cuddeback of the
Grays is fortunate this year in pos
sessing a iarge number of men
whose abilities ate approximately
equal. He expects to send a good
share of them out on the field Sat
urday in order to gain an idea of
their actions under fire.
With such an equality of material,
picking outstanding men is difficult
and Cuddeback has no easy task
selecting his starting lineup. The
following men are his choice lor
tomorrow's contest: ends, Grunsky
and Packard; tackles, Ransome and
Tatum; guards, Gould and Tarver or
Roberts; center, Kantzer. Van Del
len is due to start at quarter, with
either Oppenheim or White at full
back, and Lipscomb and Minckler as
halves.
Besides these men, a legion of
others are certain to get into the
fray at one lime or other. With such
an untried Indian combination, and
little or nothing known concerning
the S.F.U. team, it is difficult to
predict the outcome of the game.
The Gray Fog recruits will doubt
less give Cuddeback's proteges
plenty of competition as the former
have played several games this year.
The Stanford squad's experience as
a team has been limited to scrim
mage with the varsity and the
freshmen.
