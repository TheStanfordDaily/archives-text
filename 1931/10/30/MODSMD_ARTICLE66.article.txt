# JUNIORS, SOPHOMORES LEAD IN INTERCLASS CAGE TEAM PLAY
## 
### 
The first day's play of interclass
basketball established two quintets,
the Junior A's and the Soph A's, as
leading contenders for the title. The
juniors defeated the lone senior oat
fit by a 22-17 count in a battle that
was nip-and-tuck all the way.
Cordry and Meade starred for the
third-year men. while Hepp looked
good for the losers. Cordry was
high-point man of the contest with
ten markers.
The sophomore A five showed a
lot of class in trouncing the Junior
B team, the final score being 34-8.
Topping and Jenkins starred for the
winners, the former running up a
total of eighteen points before ihe
final whistle. The Junior B five
was quite submerged under ihe
brilliant lloorwork and accurate
shooting of the yearling crew and
failed to register to any degree of
consistency.
In the third contest the freshman
squad downed the Soph B team by
a 13-3 margin. Neither bunch
showed a whole lot of class, but
both had plenty of scrap. The frosh
looked good in spots but were rag
ged in their floor play. They show
possibilities, though, of development
in the future.
The fact that the sophomore and
junior teams are the strongest seems
to augur well for future Stanford
varsities. That's a good omen if
nothing else.
