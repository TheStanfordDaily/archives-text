WASHINGTON, Oct. 2D —Ad-
minisfcration plans for helping the
railroads have been shunted onto a
siding to clear the track for nego
tiations between transportation of
ficials and the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
The proposal of the latter that
revenues be increased by imposing
surcharges and poling the income
from them for the use of all the lines
is the subject of the discussions.
Until they are ended, the adminis
tration intends to be only an alertly
watchful spectator.
