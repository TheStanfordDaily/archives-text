service and hearing him discuss and
explain the particular creed of his
denomination. Upon completing the
tour, this group will attempt to i
formulate what it believes to be the I
creed for an ideal church for college !
students. Many interesting doctrines I
such as the Buddhist, Quaker, Sev- I
enth Day Adventists, and Hindu
with which most students are little 1
familiar will be included in the tour. !
Former Activities
Other of the previous activities of |
the Y.W.C.A. will be discontinued;
or replaced. Among . these are the j
weekly vesper services. Instead of i
being held weekly, as in the past, j
they will be held only once a quarter j
for special occasions such as '
Thanksgiving and Easter.
Weekly Friday night parties will j
no longer be given in the Clubhouse, l
but will be taken over by Roble i
