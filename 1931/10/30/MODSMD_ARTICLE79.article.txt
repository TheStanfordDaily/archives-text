# KiCK-OFF ABOLITION UP TO GRID BOARD
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (JP). â€”Any j
movement to abolish the kickoff in j
football, a play to which attention I
has been drawn by the fatal injury .
of Cadet Richard Sheridan in the
Army-Yale game, apparently will j
find little favor with members of
ihe Football Rules Committee.
Six of the nine members of the j
committee were reached today by |
the Associated Press for comment on |
whether they favored abolishment :
or alteration of the present rule '
which puts the ball in play by a
kickoff at the beginning of the first '
and third quarters and following!
each goal or touchdown. Four fa
vored its retention.
