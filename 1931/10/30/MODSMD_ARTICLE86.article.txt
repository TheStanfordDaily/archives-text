LOS ANGELES. Oct. 29. i,T'i
Through an analysis of "adobe" or
earth bricks used in constructing
1 the earliest houses in the South
west, a University of California pro
fessor has found plant seeds which
indicate many important field crops
were brought to America at a much
earlier date than before known.
Adobe bricks were made with
heavy clay soil, mixed with straw,
and a large amount of seed was
found with the straw, enabling ihe
professor to set an earlier date on
i several crop introductions.
