BUILDING WITH
THE ELECTRIC ARC
Just as El ias Howe's sewing machine revolutionized
the construction of textile products, arc welding is
changing methods of construction of metal products.
Electricity is changing ail the old methods, whether in
the fabrication of buildings, in manufacturing, or in
transportation.
To-day, welded steel is replacing castings; arc weld
ing is used in the construction of the automobiles in
which we ride,- it joins together those long, sinuous
pipe lines which bring oil, gas, and water from fields
end reservoirs to city and sea; silently, swiftly it knits
the steel framework of skyscrapers with joints as strong
as the metal itself; it is used in the construction of thou
sands of products in industry. It is a repair tool of uni
versal utility, fo-day has shown only a few of its uses,
while to-morrow will reveal thousands of other
applications.
The materially improved G-Earc welders, recentlyintro
duced, were largely thedevelopment of college-trained
men who had supplemented technical theory with
practical experience in the General Electric Company.
In every department these men are developing the
apparatus which makes General Electric a leader in the
electrical industry. Other young men, newly grad
uated, obtain in the Test Department experience which
fits them for future responsible positions.
