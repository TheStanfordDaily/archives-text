TOKYO, Nov. 2. (Monday) (/P)—
Conflicting reports regarding the al
leged reproachement of China and
Russia and the massing of Russia
troops beyond the border at Man
chuli has prompted the United
States to send an observer to make
a personal investigation of condi
tions in Northern Manchuria.
A Harbin dispatch today said
George Hanson, American Consul
General at Harbin, who speaks both
Chinese and Russian, started for
Tsitsihar, where he will spend sev
eral days. Later he will go to Hailar
and then probably to Manchuli. His
observations will be telegraphed di
rectly to Washington.
Reports Are Confusing
On the heels of Hanson's de
parture to the trouble area, confus
ing reports reached Tokyo of Japa
nese troop movements in Northern
Manchuria. The first of these, a
Rengo News Agency dispatch from
Changchun, said the Japanese gar
rison at Changchun was preparing
to depart for an unannounced des
tination, while "part of the troops
appeared to be preparing to move
in the direction of Harbin."
The Foreign Office discredited ther
dispatch, saying there were no indi
cations here of any reason making
necessary the movement of Japanese
troops to Harbin.
Tokyo Discredits Report
The government spokesman said
it was more likely the troops in
tended to shift to Taonan to rein
force the small garrison there pro
tecting the Japanese interests in the
Taonan-Ssupingkai Railroad.
The second Rengo dispatch from
Changchun said (500 Japanese from
the garrison at Kirin, which was
occupied at the outbreak of the
present trouble, September 18, ar
rived at Changchun en route to
Taonan, while another contingent
was to follow soon.
Russia Denies China Aid
Reports that Russians were sup
plying arms to General Man Chan-
Shan, head of the Heilungkiang
government, with headquarters at
Tsitsihar, continue to reach Tokyo.
The reports have been categori
cally denied by L. M. Karakhan,
assistant Commissar of the Russian
Foreign Office, in conversations with
the Japanese Ambassador to Mos
cow, Koki Hirota, in connection with
the recent memorandum sent by ihe
Japanese Foreign Minister, Barson
Shidehara. In it Japan called Mos
cow's attention to persistent rumors
of the massing of Russian troops at
both the eastern and western Man
churian borders.
