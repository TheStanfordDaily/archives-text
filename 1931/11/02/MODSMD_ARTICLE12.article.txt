# Gantner, Cast Well, Attains Real Heights
## Interpretation of "Berkeley Square" Makes Campus Dramatic History 
### R. J. F 
John Balderston, Vallejo Gantner,
and Harold Helvenston combined to
make Friday night's production of

"Berkeley Square" one of the high
lights of Stanford's dramatic his
tory, and a well - filled Assembly
Hall was not backward in voicing
its approval.

The power of Balderston's unique
play, with its undercurrent of the
impossible, the unbelievable, could
well have carried the show alone,
but it was Gantner, giving in the
role of Peter Standish as splendid an
individual performance as the writer
has ever witnessed at Stanford, who
strode off with the honors of the
evening.
Many Opportunities
As the man of the 20th century
who found himself, inexplicably,
able to throw back the portals of
the past and step into the London
of the third Hanoverian George,
Gantner made the most of his every
dramatic opportunity, and there
were many of them. A trifle uncer
tain of himself in the first scene, he
gained command of the entire situ
ation as he became the Peter Stan
dish of 1784, and never relinquished
that hold during the evening.

As Helen Pettigrew, the 18th cen
tury belle with whom the trans
ported modern finds himself in love,
contrary to the order of things al
ready set down in history, Peg Ran
dall Converse was adequate, no
more. Her performance was not so
clean-cut as that of Gantner's, par
ticularly in the scene where she en
visions the future, but her final fai"e
well to her lover was an admirable
piece of acting.
Secondary Honors
The writer thought secondary
honors went to James Sandoe, as
the meek, effeminate Throstle, to
Catherine Crary as Mrs. Pettigrew,
and to Donald Campbell as the
American Ambassador. Sandoe,
making his first appearance on the
Stanford stage, caught the fancy of
the audience with his characteriza
tion of the hopeless lover and gave a
splendid performance. Crary was as
good as she always is, which is good
enough for anyone, and Campbell
was excellent in a comparatively
small and not too fascinating role.
Helvenston made no mistakes in
the casting of this play, although he
might have done better with the
part of Tom Pettigrew, the disolute
younger brother, by not giving it
to Edward Girzi. Girzi is an experi
enced actor, and a good one, but he
cannot portray a rake, and he did
not help matters along by kicking
some of his lines. Dorothy Tully
was admirable as Kate Pettigrew
and Jacqueline De Wit effective as
Marjorie Frant, Standish's twentieth
century fiances, but both of them
were a trifle wooden in their emo
tional scenes.

Barbara Collins, Robert Dickey,
Terence Gcddis, and Hamilton Cum
mins did well with comparatively
small parts and Helen Forsyth and
Katherine Hatfield played the
housekeeper and the maid, respec
tively, as most people do play a
housekeeper and a maid, respec
tively—respectably.

visions the future, but her final fai"e
well to her lover was an admirable
piece of acting.
Secondary Honors
The writer thought secondary
honors went to James Sandoe, as
the meek, effeminate Throstle, to
Catherine Crary as Mrs. Pettigrew,
and to Donald Campbell as the
American Ambassador. Sandoe,
making his first appearance on the
Stanford stage, caught the fancy of
the audience with his characteriza
tion of the hopeless lover and gave a
splendid performance. Crary was as
good as she always is, which is good
enough for anyone, and Campbell
was excellent in a comparatively
small and not too fascinating role.
Helvenston made no mistakes in
the casting of this play, although he
might have done better with the
part of Tom Pettigrew, the disolute
younger brother, by not giving it
to Edward Girzi. Girzi is an experi
enced actor, and a good one, but he
cannot portray a rake, and he did
not help matters along by kicking
some of his lines. Dorothy Tully
was admirable as Kate Pettigrew
and Jacqueline De Wit effective as
Marjorie Frant, Standish's twentieth
century fiances, but both of them
were a trifle wooden in their emo
tional scenes.

Barbara Collins, Robert Dickey,
Terence Gcddis, and Hamilton Cum
mins did well with comparatively
small parts and Helen Forsyth and
Katherine Hatfield played the
housekeeper and the maid, respec
tively, as most people do play a
housekeeper and a maid, respec
tively—respectably.
John Balderston, Vallejo Gantner,
and Harold Helvenston combined to
make Friday night's production of

"Berkeley Square" one of the high
lights of Stanford's dramatic his
tory, and a well - filled Assembly
Hall was not backward in voicing
its approval.

The power of Balderston's unique
play, with its undercurrent of the
impossible, the unbelievable, could
well have carried the show alone,
but it was Gantner, giving in the
role of Peter Standish as splendid an
individual performance as the writer
has ever witnessed at Stanford, who
strode off with the honors of the
evening.
Many Opportunities
As the man of the 20th century
who found himself, inexplicably,
able to throw back the portals of
the past and step into the London
of the third Hanoverian George,
Gantner made the most of his every
dramatic opportunity, and there
were many of them. A trifle uncer
tain of himself in the first scene, he
gained command of the entire situ
ation as he became the Peter Stan
dish of 1784, and never relinquished
that hold during the evening.

As Helen Pettigrew, the 18th cen
tury belle with whom the trans
ported modern finds himself in love,
contrary to the order of things al
ready set down in history, Peg Ran
dall Converse was adequate, no
more. Her performance was not so
clean-cut as that of Gantner's, par
ticularly in the scene where she en
visions the future, but her final fai"e
well to her lover was an admirable
piece of acting.
