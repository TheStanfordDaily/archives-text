# "Press-Box Preferable To Bench" Says Jones
## 
### 
i Coach Howard Jones of U.S.C.
prefers the press box to the coach's
bench.
So he declared Saturday while
scouting the game from the com
i fortable confines of the Stanford
< box. "You can see better up here,"
I he protested, waving one finger
i around the gridiron, and admiring
J the view from this journalistic
crow's nest.
But—the Trojan Jones admitted
| that he felt like a war-horse out of
i harness, to be watching so far from
I the edge of battle.
Not much of a battle either, ac
cording to Jones' idea at the end of
\ the third quarter. His impression is
! that Stanford football men are for
| I he most part unemotional. "One of
| Stanford's serious barriers lies in the
i passive attitude of men on the field.
[Stanford is not fighting U.C.L.A. this

I afternoon," he said. "But the team
j will probably fight hard with us,"
j indicating that the stony Indian
j promises to show a flicker of inter
| est next weekend, if ever. And
Howard Jones is awaiting just thai.
Up in the press box, Coach-on-a
holiday Jones has time to philoso
| phize. "The funny thing about foot
| ball," he says, "is that you can never
| tell."
Prolonged baiting of (he famous
j southern coach brought him round
to the Big Game. "Well, California
has a good team this year — good
team—'' Plus the inference that
those men are not bored by football.
The generous Jones then offered
two items for the sake of conver-
I sational pleasantry, first, that the
| weather has been warm in Los An
! geles, and second, that he spent the
forenoon at A1 Masters' house, lis
| tening to scores over the radio.
