# SMITH ASSAILS ROOSEVELT AS BOURBONS ROW
## Cermak Booms Lewis For Democratic Nominee For President 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 1. Frontal
attacks by two Democratic party
leaders on Franklin D. Roosevelt
today thrust again to the fore the
New York Governor's reputed presi
dential aspirations.
I—Mayor Anton J. Cermack of
Chicago, arriving in New York, as
serted a "dripping wet"—a man of
the A1 Smith type—has got to be
the nominee if the Democrats hope
to win." He explained he meant
James Hamilton Lewis, United
States Senator from Illinois.
2—Former Governor Alfred E.
Smith made what political observers
called "the first direct criticism" of
Roosevelt's state administration
when he attacked his successor's
state taxation policy. He coupled
this with an appeal to the nation to
prepare for the 1932 presidential
campaign.
"Dripping Wet" Needed
"A man of the A1 Smith type
has got to be the nominee if the
Democrats' hope to win," Mayor
Cermak asserted. "If Governor
Roosevelt is wet enough to be Gov
ernor of New York and to be sup
ported by Smith, he is probably
wet enough for the national needs
of the party. But when I speak of a
man of A1 Smith's type I mean
James Hamilton Lewis."
