### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. (/Pj—A
variety of issues and personalities
combine in Tuesday's scattered elec
tions to give political prophets fresh
material for observations in the 1932
national campaign.
There is the A1 Smith-Franklin
Roosevelt dispute in New York.
There is the prohibition controversy,
involved in several contests and
dominating a congressional race in
Michigan.
Of more immediate concern is the
Democratic-Republican batttle for
control of the House which may be
settled in the results of the five
congressional elections.
Five Seats Disputed
Three of the five vacant seats to
be filled in the House belonged to
the Republicans. Democrats have
waged strenuous campaigns to cap
ture two of these—the First Ohio
and the Eighth Michigan districts.
The present lineup of the House
is Democrats, 214; Republicans, 2f3;
F 1. The other va
cancies caused by death of Repub
lican members and in districts nor
mally Republican will be filled later.
