# Moore To Sing Tomorrow In Concert Here
## Famous Music Critic Lauds Soprano's Voice 
### 
Grace Moore, whose soprano voice |
has been likened to a vibrant Stradi- j
varius—"not just a lovely voice, but ;
an organ with a personality"—by J
Samuel Chotzinoff, under whom she I
studied this summer, will sing for j
campus music lovers tomorrow night !
at 8:20 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Chotzinoff, well-known coach and
accompanist and former music critic .
on the New York World, is one of i
the many recognized teachers who I
have trained Miss Moore in her pro- !
fession.
Versatile Artist
Internationally famous, Miss [
Moore is claimed by critics to be i
"an unbeatable combination of!
American freshness and vitality and |
continental chic and sophistication."
She is versatile in her accomplish
ments, having attained success as a
prima donna, a concert artist, and a
talking screen star. But her versa
tility is not confined to her artistic
career. She is a true cosmopolitan, I
at home anywhere in the world— I
her villa at Cannes, where she I
. I
studies during the summer under a
private coach; her home in Paris; i
her shooting lodge in Scotland; her j
Park Avenue apartment in New!
York; her ranch in California; or I
her home town of Jellicoe, Ten- j
nessee.
Grace Moore's husband, Senor Va- I
lentino Parera, well-known Spanish [
screen star, is accompanying her on !
her present coast-to-coast concert j
tour. He met Miss Moore this sum- j
mer on the boat, on his way home j
from Hollywood, and they were J
married within six weeks. But they
each plan to continue their careers, |
and are considering producing a pic
ture together. At the close of her
concert tour Miss Moore will begin j
her fourth consecutive season as |
prima donna soprano of the Metro
politan Opera Company.
