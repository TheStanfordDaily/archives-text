It just COULDN'T HAPPPEN.
A harrasscd Stanford Indian, driven deep in his own territory by a
snarling and determined young Bruin, had no chance to hreak up a (>-(»
deadlock. First down on the Stanford 29-yard line and only two minutes
to play. No, the Indian was due for his third tie of the season—you could
ask any of the 12,000 assembled in the Stadium Saturday.
But it DID happen. They must have done it with mirrors. Afflerbaugh,
on two reverses off right tackle, produced a first down. Glover added
eight more through left tackle, and the crowd began to wonder what
would happen IF there were more time. Slightly raised hopes were

lashed, however, when Aillerbaugh
was tossed for a yard loss, and Al
len's long pass was knocked down.
Fourth down, the ball two yards
short of midfield and seconds to
play. Alien dropped back to toss a
long, prayerful pass, Haslam and
Bergdahl waited eagerly to knock
it down, but Colvin leaped up be
tween them to wrench it away. It
was an impossible catch, but it gave
Stanford a first down on the 25-yard
line. That play won the ball game.
Colvin Saves Day
Nine seconds to play, and the In
dians took time out. On the next
play Allen shot a perfect pass over
the goal line and into the arms of
Colvin. George Grey missed the try
for point, but nobody cared.
It was the most thrilling ending of
a Stanford game since the 13 to 13
Big Game three years ago, when a
similar play snatched a tie out of
apparent defeat. Had Saturday's
lame been played against U.S.C. or
California, it would be something
to tell your grandchildren about.
Seventy-one yards the Indians
had marched in two minutes to grab
a 12-6 decision away from a surpris
ingly strong U.C.L.A. team which
put up a great game and very nearly
I stole the show.
The Indians for the most part did
not play up to their capabilities, but
the YVestwooders demonstrated that
they are far out of the "breather"
class. They went into the game
with the idea of winning, and they
came within an ace of at least hold
ing the Big Red Machine to a tic.
That "ace' was Colvin, rushed into
■the fray in the closing minutes.
Howard Jones, taking a final
look at the Indians before next
Saturday's game at Los Angeles,
perfectly sized up the situation
in an exclusive statement to
your correspondent.
"I STILL expect a great
i game," said the Trojan Head
! Man after the Bruin scare.
"Stanford wasn't at all inspired
today. They started a bunch of
reserves, and ran into a better
j team than they expected, that's
all."
j Pop Warner said early last week
that he expected a "tough game"
from the Bruins, but he couldn't
make the squad believe it. Think
ing only of the U.S.C. battle ahead,
the squad could view the U.C.L.A.
affair only in the light of a "push
over."
Bruins Score
Warner started a mixture of sec
ond- and third-string men against
the Uclans, as announced in Fri
days Daily, but they didn't prove
equal to the occasion. The first
, quarter was about even, with nei
j ther team showing much. In the
i second period, however, the Bruin
i launched an offensive bolt that pro
duced a touchdown with startling
suddenness.
