Once more Pan-Hellenic steals the spotlight with a hor
rible example of what petty regulations and suspicious
natures can do to a group of otherwise sensible girls.
Meeting last Thursday, the council discovered that a
general accusation of dirty rushing was being broadcast
bv practically every sorority, although none of them had
any specific charges to make. There have been no overt
violations of rushing regulations, but every house "just
knows that Ihe others are rushing illegally."
And so Pan-Hellenic proceeded to jumble further a
situation that is already ludicrous. What with regulations
forbidding How women to speak unnecessarily to fresh
man women, and compelling the former to report accounts
of their meetings with freshmen, Pan-Hellenic suggested
that, in the future, How women should avoid speaking to
freshman women when they go to Hoble for lunch or din
ner, and that they avoid going on double dates with the
first-year girls. Too often, Pan-Hellenic fell, How women
visil Hoble with "malicious intent."
In a University that boasts of an Honor Code, Pan-Hel
lenic's action is lamentable. If How women believe thai
no; one of their number has enough honor to respect cer
tain fundamental agreements, then Pan-Hellenic would do
well to abolish all regulations and let Satan take the hind
most. Excessive rushing rules, written or unwritten, such
as the council seeks to put into effect, are a damning re
flection on the personal integrity of every Row woman at
Stanford.
