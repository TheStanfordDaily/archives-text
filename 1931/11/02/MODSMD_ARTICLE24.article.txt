Soul horn (California students arc a (rifle peeved about
liif way Ihe Trojans are gelling ribbed for Iha t 0-0 victory
over Ihe (ioldcn Bears, and they have a legitimate cause to

squawk.
Since a week ago Saturday everyone north of the Tc
hachapi has been remarking about Ihe "Southern (Califor
nia myth" and the "Troy must build down to Ihe rest of the
Pacific (Coast (Conference" gag and the laughs have been
long and loud.
t'niversity of (California adherents have been Ihe loud
est in snickering nl the Trojans, claiming a moral victory
for Ihe Hears, and the sports editor of the Daily (Uilifor
iiian has even gone on record as foreseeing a victory of
7 I (I proportions for the Hears next year.
What's il all about? (Coach Howard Jones of Southern
(California lias made no absurd claims for his team; no
recognized agent of the Trojans has talked about them
"outclassing the rest of Ihe (Coast." A few fal-headed
sports writers in Ihe southern cilv have had a rush of
words to the mouth and coined rash and illogical phrases,
bill the Trojans have gone about Ihe task of winning fool
ball games in comparative silence. Southern (California
lias a good football team; ils supoprters know il is not a
miracle eleven, but only a lirsl rale one one that will take
a lot of healing.
In a way, il is unfortunate for the Jonesmcn that Iheir
most enthusiastic supporters have access to the public
prints. The southerners must enter each contest sur
rounded by an aura of hooey, not of Iheir own making, that
makes Ihem look ridiculous if they do not win by an over
whelming score.
Stanford knows Ihe caliber of Southern (California fool
ball. and Stanford will be out there leveling for the Tro
jans next Saturday. None of this moral victory stuff,
either we want more points on the scoreboard or we'll
acknowledge our licking like gentlemen.
