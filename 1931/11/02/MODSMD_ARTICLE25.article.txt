### 
Once ;i year about this season, I lie. Stanford Mothers'
Club gives a ('.lirvsantlicmmn Tea al President Hoover's
home.
Wlial is a "Chrysanthemum Tea"?
In the program of the Mothers' Club are included many
activities, most important of which are the provision for
the two rest homes, and assistance to needy students. Moth
these functions demand support financially, and like so
many other similar undertakings are handicapped.
The Chrysanthemum Tea furnishes a most important
source of financial hacking for a worthy cause and de
serves complete, wholehearlcd support.
