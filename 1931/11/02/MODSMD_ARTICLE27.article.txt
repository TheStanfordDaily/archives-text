NEW RUSSIA'S PRIMER—By M.
Ilin, Published by Houghton Mif
flin Company, and translated from
the Russian by (i. S. Counts and
N. P. Lodge.
This is the Story of the Five Year
Plan. Written by an obscure Soviet
engineer it was designed for the use
of school children from 12 to 14
years of age to promote their loyalty
to the cause of Communism.
Obviously it is propaganda. But
whether in the original or trans
lated, in all the realm of printed
matter there is no other book like
it. Inspired by a vision that is seek
ing to transform the social world
and in a simple, extraordinarily
charming way, the author writes of
the problems confronting his coun
try in effective fashion.
America looms large in the minds
of the Soviets as the land of Mech
anical Plenty, but it comes of! much
the worse for comparison with
Sovietland, being termed "A Mad
Country." Writes Ilin: "In America
the machine is not a helper to the
worker but an enemy. But how is
it with us? The more machines we
have the easier will be the work,
the shorter will be the working day,
the lighter and happier will, be the
lives of all. We build factories in
order that there may be no poverty,
no filth, no sickness, no unemploy
ment." New Russia's Primer im
presses us as a work of genius.

CAUGHT PLASTERED — At the
New Stanford Theatre.
The long and the short of it,
Wheeler and Woolsey, show their
best mirth-provoking action yet in
their latest vehicle. The boys turn
philanthropic and pull a failing drug
store out of the red by eliminating
the drugs. They slide out of a boot
leg mix-up by ihe skin of their
teeth and the thin smoke of Wheel
er's eternal elongated stogey. Wool
sey's husky voice is not unpleasant
in the few musical interludes, and
Dorothy Lee as Ihe police chief',;
flapper daughter works convincing
havoc with his pulse.
This was pleasant material for Ihe

i feature, but the shorts take the cake
; this time. A condensed Van Dine
mystery made a fine substitute for
J the usual comedy and showed good
I taste in that the feature was comic.
1 Best of all was the first installment
of Pop's football pictures, "Trick
1 Plays." These are the clearest and
: best football pictures we, have seen
and beat the Notre Dame and U.S.C.
| productions into a cocked hat. And
! this is said in no home-town boost
: ing spirit. If you don't believe that.,
see it yourself; and if you do, see
! it anyway. —S.C.A.

SKYLINE—At the Varsity Theatre.
"He climbed to the heights from
! the city's depths," reads the press J
notice. Hardie Albright is a young
i Irishman who has lived all his life :
!on a barge on the Hudson River.
1 The New York skyline intrigues him
and one day he jumps into the river
and swims ashore. He has left the
barge forever and now seeks his |
i fortune in the "big city." The rest of i
i the story deals with his ambition to
| build skyscrapers.
This, his first picture since his j
| "retirement" a few years ago, finds j
! Thomas Meighan still a convincing ;
'actor. He plays the successful en-j
• gineer and is an excellent contrast '
j to the youthful Albright. The usual j
l Myrna Loy echoes Meighan's note i
lof sophistication while Maureen
I O'Sullivan is cast opposite Albright. I
| Miss O'Sullivan deserves to be bet- i
j ter known. Her Irish brogue adds j
! to her charm as an actress, making
i her quite delightful. —E.T.P. j
