VERSES WHICH COMMEMORATE I
A PASSION INAPPROPRIATE
In times which antedate
The days of real estate
Came a youth to celebrate
His day ashore.
Met a maid disconsolate
Albeit quite effeminate,
Saw in her a candidate
By no. means to deplore.
I
Approached her quite precipitate,
Said, "My dear, why can't we culti- .
vate
A love that will annihilate
This worldly bore?
"I'd be a spouse to emulate.
Quite truly I'm commiserate,
Of you I'd be considerate,
Nor do I snore."
Her eyes did then illuminate
As if she meant to intimate
That mayhap she'd capitulate
a ,To his lore.
He took her glance to indicate

I
! She thought herself quite fortunate
j To have a love so passionate
On any score.
I
\ Alas, she was illiterate,
! Indeed, could not articulate
That she had five lovers inveterate
And several more.
| Soon came the lovers to eradicate
, The youth who was so importunate,
i (His end I'll not elucidate.
They were a score.)
Friday's story of the student who
| wrote that only God knew this on
| his blue book reminds us of an ex
perience in freshman English. Find
ing our mind resembling Old Mother
j Hubbard's cupboard at an important
J ex. we nobly filled our hook with
our inimitable band of humor
(advt.) and signed in frontâ€”"Bona
; parte, Napoleon."
Back came the ex, and scrawled
in the instructor's hand we read:
"It's time to skedaddle off to St,
| Helena, Napoleon."
