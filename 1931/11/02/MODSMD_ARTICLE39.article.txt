WHO IS going to break that St. j
Mary's bubble? The Galloping Gaels j
have had some narrow squeaks this }
season, but they remain the only j
undefeated, untied eleven on the ,
coast, with Stanford being the only j
other undefeated team..
Santa Clara put up a great
battle yesterday, but suc
cumbed, 21 to 14, after a spec
tacular game. Two hurdles re- j
main on the Gael schedule |
which may trip them up—Ore
gon and Southern Methodist.
The Melholists appear to have the j
best chance to stop the Gael march j
to "national honors." They are as j
yet undefeated in a section of the j
country that produces teams every j
bit as powerful as those of the Pa
cific Coast.
ANOTHER OREGON team
invades the East to trounce a
favored New York University
eleven in its own back yard.
Reminding of the sensational in
vasion of New York three years
ago by "Josh" Oregon State and
"Si" Stanford, Oregon upset
N.Y.U. in Yankee stadium Sat
urday, 14 to (J.
Oregon being a coast team of only !
average strength, and N.Y.U. being j
one of the most powerful teams on i
the Atlantic coast this season, the '
game served to remind the East that i
the Pacific Coast is still superior.
WHICH REMINDS that Stan
ford's victory over Minnesota
was not such a minor accom
plishment. Far from' being the
doormat of their league, the Go
phers trounced Wisconsin, 14 to
0, Saturday to continue their
winning streak. Minnesota and
Northwestern will meet this
week in a game which will
probably decide the Big Ten
championship.
IF YOU ask us:
SPUD HARDY can play on bur
football team any time. With Mof- j
fatt not even in uniform Saturday, j
he had an opportunity to display his {
wares. His 33-yard runback of a j
punt near the end of the third quar- I
ter could hardly have been im- i
proved by Moffatt himself.
CALDWELL, U. C. L. A. back, t
should have run, instead of passing, |
when half the Stanford team poured":
past him when he was looking for j
a receiver in the third quarter.
MILLIGAN looks better every
week on defense, and will probably
start against U.S.C.
REYNOLDS, of basketball note,
looks like a coming end.
HOWARD JONES got a great kick
out of that last; Allen-to-Colvin pass j
Saturday. Along with 11,999 others 1
in the stands.—L. M. C.

SPUD HARDY can play on bur
football team any time. With Mof- j
fatt not even in uniform Saturday, j
he had an opportunity to display his {
wares. His 33-yard runback of a j
punt near the end of the third quar- I
ter could hardly have been im- i
proved by Moffatt himself.
CALDWELL, U. C. L. A. back, t
should have run, instead of passing, |
when half the Stanford team poured":
past him when he was looking for j
a receiver in the third quarter.
MILLIGAN looks better every
week on defense, and will probably
start against U.S.C.
REYNOLDS, of basketball note,
looks like a coming end.
HOWARD JONES got a great kick
out of that last; Allen-to-Colvin pass j
Saturday. Along with 11,999 others 1
in the stands.—L. M. C.
WHO IS going to break that St. j
Mary's bubble? The Galloping Gaels j
have had some narrow squeaks this }
season, but they remain the only j
undefeated, untied eleven on the ,
coast, with Stanford being the only j
other undefeated team..
Santa Clara put up a great
battle yesterday, but suc
cumbed, 21 to 14, after a spec
tacular game. Two hurdles re- j
main on the Gael schedule |
which may trip them up—Ore
gon and Southern Methodist.
The Melholists appear to have the j
best chance to stop the Gael march j
to "national honors." They are as j
yet undefeated in a section of the j
country that produces teams every j
bit as powerful as those of the Pa
cific Coast.
ANOTHER OREGON team
invades the East to trounce a
favored New York University
eleven in its own back yard.
Reminding of the sensational in
vasion of New York three years
ago by "Josh" Oregon State and
"Si" Stanford, Oregon upset
N.Y.U. in Yankee stadium Sat
urday, 14 to (J.
Oregon being a coast team of only !
average strength, and N.Y.U. being j
one of the most powerful teams on i
the Atlantic coast this season, the '
game served to remind the East that i
the Pacific Coast is still superior.
WHICH REMINDS that Stan
ford's victory over Minnesota
was not such a minor accom
plishment. Far from' being the
doormat of their league, the Go
phers trounced Wisconsin, 14 to
0, Saturday to continue their
winning streak. Minnesota and
Northwestern will meet this
week in a game which will
probably decide the Big Ten
championship.
