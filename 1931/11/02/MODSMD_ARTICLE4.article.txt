# OLYMPIC FINALS POINT THIS WAY
## Maloney's Proposed Trip Strengthens Chance 
### 
The probability that Stanford Sta
i dium, rather than the Los Angeles
Coliseum, will be the scene of the
I final tryouts for the American
1 Olympic Games track and field team
| in 1932, was considerably strength
| ened by the announcement that
: Harry W. Maloney will go east be
fore November 15.
Both Frederick Rupien, secretary
of the American Olympic Games
Association, and Joseph England,
chairman of the American Olympic
| Games Track and Field Committee,
have written Maloney requesting
j him to be present at the meeting of
; the committee in Kansas City on
; that date.
j While official approval is reserved
for the Executive Committee, meet
i ing in New York, November 29, it is
1 hoped that such approval will prove
i a mere formality. Chicago, first
! named for the finals, has withdrawn
| its bid, and Los Angeles, a tentative
j successor, is known to be in favor
! of holding the trials at Stanford.
| This will eliminate the chance of
taking interest away from the
j Games themselves in Los Angeles,
i The finals will be held July 13-14,
! 1932, and if they are awarded to
I Stanford will form the high-spot of
! a Bay region track and field pro-
I gram that will rival Los Angeles'
I 1932 Olympic Games in scope. This
j program includes the 1.C.4-A. cham
| pionships, to be held in Berkeley
next May, and the British Empire
and Japan vs. Germany internation
al meets to be held in San Francisco,
following the Olympic Games.
