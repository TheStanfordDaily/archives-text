# Indian Kickers Win 3-1 California Tilt
## First of Annual Three-Game Series Goes to Stanford; Babes Smothered by Lively Bear Cubs 
### 
]I)IEETING the California kickers in the first of the annual three-game
Big Series, the Stanford varsity soccer team gave the Bears a decisive i
trouncing, 3-1, Saturday morning on the campus field.
For the first time this season the forward line worked as a unit. The game
was hard-fought from the opening whistle, but the Indians were plainly j
the superior team. The game was hardly under way when the Bears
threatened to score. Led by their veteran star. Smart, they netted the
hall after a hectic battle down the left side. Only the fact that one of their
men committed a foul as the ball sailed between the uprights saved
Stanford from a score. But the Bears' loss was Stanford's gain. Tho
forward line took matters into its own hands and Captain Falk kept

®Smart bottled lip for the remainder
| of the game.
Bears Score First
California scored first when Hol
derman banked one past Goalie
j Webster, but Hearn evendd things
jup a few minutes later, and half
| time found the score one-all.
The second half was even for the
| first ten minutes, until Stanford got
j its passing game under way again
, and Ted Beggs drove one through
! to make it 2-1. The fans had barely
I time to regain their seats before
| the entire Indian forward wail was
knocking at the Bears' lair again.
All five of the forwards took a kick
at the ball before Art Hearn got it
j through on his second attempt.
Handicap Faced
That ended the scoring for the
! day. With only 15 minutes left to
| play Coach Moloney sent in two
j substitutes at the wing positions,
> and from then on the team played
| defensive ball.
! In California's defense it must be
: said that an injury to their right
I fullback, which forced him to leave
j the game early in the initial period,
weakened their team considerably.
! However, this does not overshadow
j the fine improvement shown by the
Redshirt varsity. The work of
Holmes and Moore, the backs, was
outstanding.
Frosh Trounced
The Stanford frosh ran into big
game when they encountered the
j Bear Cubs, and emerged on the
I short end of a 5-1 score. The
| Papooses showed their lack of prac
| tice when the Cubs were able to
I score three of their five goals in
I nearly as many minutes, shortly
| after the second half commenced.
The playing of Captain Doug Ken
j nedy. White, and Emerick was com
j mendable. With another two weeks'
I practice the frosh should be able to
i give the Cubs a good run for their
i money.

]I)IEETING the California kickers in the first of the annual three-game
Big Series, the Stanford varsity soccer team gave the Bears a decisive i
trouncing, 3-1, Saturday morning on the campus field.
For the first time this season the forward line worked as a unit. The game
was hard-fought from the opening whistle, but the Indians were plainly j
the superior team. The game was hardly under way when the Bears
threatened to score. Led by their veteran star. Smart, they netted the
hall after a hectic battle down the left side. Only the fact that one of their
men committed a foul as the ball sailed between the uprights saved
Stanford from a score. But the Bears' loss was Stanford's gain. Tho
forward line took matters into its own hands and Captain Falk kept

®Smart bottled lip for the remainder
| of the game.
Bears Score First
California scored first when Hol
derman banked one past Goalie
j Webster, but Hearn evendd things
jup a few minutes later, and half
| time found the score one-all.
The second half was even for the
| first ten minutes, until Stanford got
j its passing game under way again
, and Ted Beggs drove one through
! to make it 2-1. The fans had barely
I time to regain their seats before
| the entire Indian forward wail was
knocking at the Bears' lair again.
All five of the forwards took a kick
at the ball before Art Hearn got it
j through on his second attempt.
Handicap Faced
That ended the scoring for the
! day. With only 15 minutes left to
| play Coach Moloney sent in two
j substitutes at the wing positions,
> and from then on the team played
| defensive ball.
! In California's defense it must be
: said that an injury to their right
I fullback, which forced him to leave
j the game early in the initial period,
weakened their team considerably.
! However, this does not overshadow
j the fine improvement shown by the
Redshirt varsity. The work of
Holmes and Moore, the backs, was
outstanding.
Frosh Trounced
The Stanford frosh ran into big
game when they encountered the
j Bear Cubs, and emerged on the
I short end of a 5-1 score. The
| Papooses showed their lack of prac
| tice when the Cubs were able to
I score three of their five goals in
I nearly as many minutes, shortly
| after the second half commenced.
The playing of Captain Doug Ken
j nedy. White, and Emerick was com
j mendable. With another two weeks'
I practice the frosh should be able to
i give the Cubs a good run for their
i money.
