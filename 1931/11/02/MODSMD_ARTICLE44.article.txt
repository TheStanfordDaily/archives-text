Closing the first week of mural I
, touch football the Breakers gave El j
i Tigre a sound spanking, 20-7, in the
j only game played Friday.
Breakers featured a passing at
j tack that had the Tigre men com
j pletely bewildered, save for a tem
-1 porary lull when Nielsen got behind
j their secondary defense and took
I Ames' pass across the goal for El
j Tigre's only score.
Twice the Breakers scored on ;
passes from Vince Phillipi to Bur
gess. But the prize play of the sea- ;

son so far came after Carl Recknagel
spent a couple of downs in a re
clining position near the side lines
and then took Phillipi's 40-yard toss
over the line for the third Breaker
score.
