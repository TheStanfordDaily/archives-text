# McKELVEY THREATENS COAST SWIM RECORD
## 
### 
A check-up by Coach Thornton
has brought to light the fact that
McKelvey, in Thursday's time trials,
not only swam the 100-yard free
style in 54.8 seconds, as stated in
Friday's Daily, but in the even, bet
ter time of 53.8! This is within 7-10
of a second of the Pacific Coast in
tercollegiate record, as well as being
a new mark for Encina pool time
trials.
McKelvey's work the week before
amounted to a 54.8 speed, a full sec
ond slower than his recent record.
If this cut is duplicated next week,
Stanford may have a new Pacific
Coast titleholder next spring.
