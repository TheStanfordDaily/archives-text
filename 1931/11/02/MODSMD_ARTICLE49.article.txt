# FORMER TRACK STARS PERFORM
## Gaels Sweep Santa Clara With Running Attack 
### Dick Strouse 
Past and future Stanford track
stars refused to show the present
cdititon of Dink Templeton's cin
dermen the deference due them last
Friday and ran off with most of
the honors in the weekly practice
meet. The disrespectful ex-Cardinals
included Podge Smith, who won the
high hurdles in :15.8, Virg Dowell,
who broad-jumped 22 feet 6'/a
inches to win his specialty, and Bob
Brown, who was second in the 660.
Bill Miller, of Menlo J.C., who
has been trying to get into Stanford
for many long, lean years and who
expects to see his hopes successfully
culminated this January, was forced
to hoist his body 13 feet 3 inches
in the air before he could beat Bert
DeGroot in the pole vault.
Herbert Promising
Next to DeGroot's vault of 13
feet, perhaps the most encouraging
performance recorded by a member
of the 1932 was Herbert's mark of
:25.1 in the lows. Herbert and Jack
Brugman are at present the out
standing hurdlers, and Jack con
tributed his share Friday by run
ning second to Smith in the highs.
Kalph Giberson, who threatens to
return to his 1930 form, won the
hundred in : 10.2 and finished just
behind A1 Blackmail, a fine fresh
man prospect, in the 220.
Templeton's two national cham
pions, Ben Eastman and Bob Jones,
again showed their class. Ben, after
running the 100, won the 352-yard
dash in :37.2, which is only 7-10 of
a second over Les Hables' unofficial
world's record, and Jones threw
the discus 144 feet 8 inches. Dan
Murphy looked good when he fin
ished second in the 352, and Jones
also garnered a third in the highs.
FuUcmvider Stars
Frank Fullenwider starred among
the distance men, winning the 860 in
1:26.7&80b Atkinson again took ihe
3-lap event, with last year's Cali
fornia interscholastic mile cham
pion, Morentin. second. Art Azevedo
and Paul Aebersold started out
their promised rivalry auspiciously,
and Art drew first blood when he
won the 6-lap grind in 7:33.8. Fresh
man Devlin finished a good third.
John Lyman was the day's high
point man, as he was first, second,
third, and fourth in the shot put.
Lyman beat himself with a heave
of 46 feet 10% inches. A1 Ray won
the javelin at 182 feet and Ned
Johns twice missed 13 feet in the
pole vault by only the width of ihe
skin of his elbow.

who broad-jumped 22 feet 6'/a
inches to win his specialty, and Bob
Brown, who was second in the 660.
Bill Miller, of Menlo J.C., who
has been trying to get into Stanford
for many long, lean years and who
expects to see his hopes successfully
culminated this January, was forced
to hoist his body 13 feet 3 inches
in the air before he could beat Bert
DeGroot in the pole vault.
Herbert Promising
Next to DeGroot's vault of 13
feet, perhaps the most encouraging
performance recorded by a member
of the 1932 was Herbert's mark of
:25.1 in the lows. Herbert and Jack
Brugman are at present the out
standing hurdlers, and Jack con
tributed his share Friday by run
ning second to Smith in the highs.
Kalph Giberson, who threatens to
return to his 1930 form, won the
hundred in : 10.2 and finished just
behind A1 Blackmail, a fine fresh
man prospect, in the 220.
Templeton's two national cham
pions, Ben Eastman and Bob Jones,
again showed their class. Ben, after
running the 100, won the 352-yard
dash in :37.2, which is only 7-10 of
a second over Les Hables' unofficial
world's record, and Jones threw
the discus 144 feet 8 inches. Dan
Murphy looked good when he fin
ished second in the 352, and Jones
also garnered a third in the highs.
FuUcmvider Stars
Frank Fullenwider starred among
the distance men, winning the 860 in
1:26.7&80b Atkinson again took ihe
3-lap event, with last year's Cali
fornia interscholastic mile cham
pion, Morentin. second. Art Azevedo
and Paul Aebersold started out
their promised rivalry auspiciously,
and Art drew first blood when he
won the 6-lap grind in 7:33.8. Fresh
man Devlin finished a good third.
John Lyman was the day's high
point man, as he was first, second,
third, and fourth in the shot put.
Lyman beat himself with a heave
of 46 feet 10% inches. A1 Ray won
the javelin at 182 feet and Ned
Johns twice missed 13 feet in the
pole vault by only the width of ihe
skin of his elbow.
Past and future Stanford track
stars refused to show the present
cdititon of Dink Templeton's cin
dermen the deference due them last
Friday and ran off with most of
the honors in the weekly practice
meet. The disrespectful ex-Cardinals
included Podge Smith, who won the
high hurdles in :15.8, Virg Dowell,
who broad-jumped 22 feet 6'/a
inches to win his specialty, and Bob
Brown, who was second in the 660.
