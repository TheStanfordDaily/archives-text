Led by Captain Leonard Pock

swept the Olympic Club team off its
feet in the Heron trophy matches
last Friday night in Encina gym.
The Cards took 18 contests to their
opponents' seven.
The five-man teams competed in
round robin style. Criley, Ferguson,
Pearman and Captain Pockman of
Stanford each won four out of five
matches, while Tom Pockman won
two. Since California and Stanford
both have defeated the Olympians,
the Heron trophy will go to the win
ner of the Indian-Bear matches on
November 13.
In the finals of the A.F.L.A. Bay
division foils handicaps, held Friday
in conjunction with the Heron con
tests, Locke of California took first
place, Snyder of Stanford, second,
and Herk Adams, former Stanford
captain, now fencing for the Olym
pic Club, third. Pearman, another
Stanford fencer, had gained a place
in the finals, but one entrant
dropped out, and when his record
was eliminated, Adams advanced to
the finals instead.
