# JUNIORS WIN HOCKEY, TENNIS, ARCHERY IN ANNUAL TRIANGULAR SPORTS MEET
## 
### 
Taking blue ribbons in three out
of four sports, hockey, archery, and
tennis, and placing fourth in swim
ming, the junior classes of Mills,
California, and Stanford collected 16
points to win the annual Triangular
Sports Day held here Saturday. The
seniors were a close second with 14
markers.
The proposed plan of having
straight interclass intercollegiate
competition, in which each class
would compete within itself for su
premacy, was given up in favor of
having class teams of one school
meet a different class team of an
other school, because fewer games
would be necessary.
The class winning the majority of
games in each sport was given first
place. Scoring was on the basis of
five points for first place, three for
second, two for third, and one for
fourth place. The freshman women
proved their superiority over the
sophomores, coming out with seven

I and a half points to the latters' six
I and a half.
Although school distinctions were
! not made, Stanford tennis players
give Mills and California an idea of
their ability, winning all of their
single matches and two of their
; doubles. California's hockey team
I showed up better than that of any
i other school, while Mills and the
J Berkeley women divided honors in
! swimming. Playing 011 the whole,
j however, was very ragged and
I showed lack of practice and team
j work.
Because California sent over no
golfers, making it impossible to
carry out thÂ£ system of scoring, no
; points were awarded in that sport
| although Mills lost to Stanford in
all matches.
Going out to hunt for butter is
; an ordinary experience in Trinidad,
! where the natives catch fat, young
| "oil birds" and melt down a supply
I of butter.
