SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1. <7P)— j
St. Mary's Galloping Gaels put on 1
a brilliant fight today when they de- |
feated their keenest rivals, Santa ;
Clara's Broncos, 21 to 14, to main- ;
tain their record of the only un- j
defeated and untied major eleven j
on the Pacific Coast this season.
While 50,000 spectators thrilled to j
the fiercest battle seen in Kezar i
Stadium this season, the Gaels met 1
and matched the offensive tactics j
of the Santa Clara eleven that was j
fighting from the opening kickoff j
until the finish of the game.
Santa Clara scored first after an
exchange of kicks had given them
the ball. Two passes, the first from
Jurnich to Dan?., and the second
from the same thrower and received
by G. Dowd, accounted for the
touchdown. Dowd caught the oval
over the goal line. Judnich made the
try for point with a place kick.
The Gaels went into the lead in j
the fourth period after a thrust from
Santa Clara's 33-yard line. The 07-
yard gain saw steady smashes at the
line with Brovelli, substituting at
fullback for Partee, crossing the j
markers for steady gains. At the 14- !
yard line, a lateral pass, Brovelli to j
Baird, accounted for 10 yards. Bro- j
velli added two more yards through j
center, und Baird ran around his j
right end for the winning score.
