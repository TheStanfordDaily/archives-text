# WATER FIGHT BOMB SEVERS L. A. PIPELINE
## Ranchers Of Owens Valley Blast City Aqueduct To Renew Feud 
### 
LOS ANGELES, I-rov. 2. (/P)—A j
dynamite blast roared through i'ne I
narrow Owens Valley today and |
I ripped two sections out of the aque
j duct that supplies Los Angeles with |
the major share of its High Sierra ■
I water. It was the tenth explosion in j
| a series rife with court convictions, j
i terrorism, and armed rebellion.
Two sections, about 12 feet long, |
; were blown out of the grapevine j
siphon, 20 miles north of Jawbone j
Canyon, near Mojave in the desert.
Repairmen, flanked by deputy sher- I
iffs and city police, were dispatched i
by the Los Angeles bureau of water j
and power to repair the damaged |
j portion of the 250-milg aqueduct. j
No Water Shortage
Peace has reigned between Owens i
Valley ranchers and Los Angeles
for several months, H. A. Van Nor- j
i man, chief engineer of the bureau, j
| said in failing to account for the |
dynamiting. He said there is not a j
possibility of water shortages be- :
cause other reservoirs are full.
Dynamite has contested Los An- !
geles' right to Owens Valley water j
for the last eight years. Prior to
! the installation of the aqueduct in
1 1924, city agents acquiring water
| lands in the valley met with re
i buiTs when they refused to pay ten
' times the assessed value of the
j lands.
Stormy History
Masked men struck the first blow
j May 21, 1924. A large section of the 1
j aqueduct near Lone Pine, Inyo
j county, was dynamited. During a 1
j four-year period, from May 1924
until July 1927 the aqueduct was j
J blasted seven times.
I An armed rebellion that for a
time threatened to extend through- !
out the district through which the
I aqueduct passes, lasted several days \
in November 1924. Ranchers held
! off city guards, while others opened j
flood gates and turned the water •
onto the desert.
