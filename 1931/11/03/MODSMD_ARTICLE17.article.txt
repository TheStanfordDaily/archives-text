# Alpha Delts Win Grid Game From Sequoia II
## 
### 
Displaying a versatile attack which
| featured long end-sweeps by Nay-
I lon and Fuller, and the near-perfect
1 blocking of "Chick" Lee, the Alpha
j Delta trounced Sequoia 11, 27-0, in
1 yesterday's intramural football head
liner.
Another member was added to the
| "mural row" in the local hospital,
I when Lee skidded on his shoulder
' and was forced to leave the game.
The loss seriously handicaps the
I Alpha Delta offense, since Lee's
' blocking ability has been the cause
I of most of their scoring to date.
Taking their cue from last Satur
; day's varsity battle with U.C.L.A.,
Phi Delta Phi eked out a (5-0 victory
! over the strong El Capitan team,
J when Allen took Churchill's 25-yard
! toss ovet the goal-line in the last
i minute of play. The Clubmen had
fought the lawyers to a standstill
up to the time of this last-minute
break.
A.K.L. took the other close battle
of the day from the Chi Psi's with
only four minutes of play remain
ing. Thorup intercepted a pass on

J the 50-yard marker and sprinted i
down the side-lines to make the i
final score 12-7.
The A.K.L.'s took the lead shortly I
after the opening whistle, when j
Cornell caught McCoy's 20-yard :
pass over the goal line. But on the ;
first play after the kick-off, Chi Psi
recovered a fumble on the A.K.L. j
30-yard stripe. They scored on the |
first play, Little to Rhoadcs, and j
iwhen Little kicked goal the Chi j
Psi's took a one-point lead that |
looked big enough for a win, until .
| Thorup's spectacular excursion.
Tallying once on Larson's pass to j
Wheeler, good for 20 yards, and
again when Wheeler intercepted a j
I Los Arcos pass on the 30-yard line
! and ran the remaining distance, the
Sigma Chi outfit scored an easy 14-0
victory over the clubmen.
Los Arcos was unable to get with- :
in the fraternity's 20-yard line, while
i Larson's accurate passes kept them
on the defensive throughout most 1
of the game.
In the only other scheduled game, 1
the Phi Delts won by default from '
.the El Campo aggregation.

down the side-lines to make the i
final score 12-7.
The A.K.L.'s took the lead shortly I
after the opening whistle, when j
Cornell caught McCoy's 20-yard :
pass over the goal line. But on the ;
first play after the kick-off, Chi Psi
recovered a fumble on the A.K.L. j
30-yard stripe. They scored on the |
first play, Little to Rhoadcs, and j
iwhen Little kicked goal the Chi j
Psi's took a one-point lead that |
looked big enough for a win, until .
| Thorup's spectacular excursion.
Tallying once on Larson's pass to j
Wheeler, good for 20 yards, and
again when Wheeler intercepted a j
I Los Arcos pass on the 30-yard line
! and ran the remaining distance, the
Sigma Chi outfit scored an easy 14-0
victory over the clubmen.
Los Arcos was unable to get with- :
in the fraternity's 20-yard line, while
i Larson's accurate passes kept them
on the defensive throughout most 1
of the game.
In the only other scheduled game, 1
the Phi Delts won by default from '
.the El Campo aggregation.
Displaying a versatile attack which
| featured long end-sweeps by Nay-
I lon and Fuller, and the near-perfect
1 blocking of "Chick" Lee, the Alpha
j Delta trounced Sequoia 11, 27-0, in
1 yesterday's intramural football head
liner.
Another member was added to the
| "mural row" in the local hospital,
I when Lee skidded on his shoulder
' and was forced to leave the game.
The loss seriously handicaps the
I Alpha Delta offense, since Lee's
' blocking ability has been the cause
I of most of their scoring to date.
Taking their cue from last Satur
; day's varsity battle with U.C.L.A.,
Phi Delta Phi eked out a (5-0 victory
! over the strong El Capitan team,
J when Allen took Churchill's 25-yard
! toss ovet the goal-line in the last
i minute of play. The Clubmen had
fought the lawyers to a standstill
up to the time of this last-minute
break.
A.K.L. took the other close battle
of the day from the Chi Psi's with
only four minutes of play remain
ing. Thorup intercepted a pass on

J the 50-yard marker and sprinted i
down the side-lines to make the i
