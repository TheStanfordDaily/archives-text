# JUST FIFTEEN CENTS
## 
### 
{Editorial)
Tonight the Daily goes before tlie Executive Committee
to ask for an increase of l.~> cents per student per quarter
in IHe amount allotted from the A.S.S.U. dues each quarter.
From the -%'i each student pays to the Associated Stu
dents, the Daii.y now receives l>o cents, or .$l.BO a year the
lowest subscription price of any first-class college news
paper on the Pacific ('.oast. Because of this low fee, the
Daily has rarely, if ever, made a profit similar to those of
j other campus publications, and now, with advertisers
i slashing their schedules to the bone, the Daily finds itself
I backed to the financial wall. In order to make both ends
' meet this year, the business 'office has been forced to cease
! delivery to students living in Palo Alto. If the Executive
I Committee turns down tonight's request, then curtailment
! of circulation to living groups ON the campus may rcason
i ably follow if the Daily is to maintain its present news
-1 paper standard.
This year the Associated Students will have available
i some $2,000 more than ever before, inasmuch as the final
payment on tlie basketball pavilion is to be made. By in
creasing the Daily allotment from (SO cents to 75 cents a
j quarter, llie Associated Students can not only solve the cir
! dilation problem which now confronts the campus, but
i will enable the Daily to improve ils editorial appearance
j 50 per cent. Six-page papers would be the rule rather than
i the exception; the necessity for unsightly filler ads would
be disposed of; local art, always an attraction, would be
made possible.
The A.S.S.U. has the money available. The Daily needs
the money. How about it?
