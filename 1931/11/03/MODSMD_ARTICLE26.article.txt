### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. </J J l —
' The Grand Old Man of American
J jurisprudence was back on the Su
| preme Court bench for today's
j meeting, after an absence from-sev
| eral sessions which caused appre
] hension among his admirers.
Not only was Justicc'Oliver Wen
dell Holmes on hand, but he handed
; down two opinions—first of the
term.
After the court adjourned he had
■ difficulty, as usual, in getting up
' from his chair. All of his associates
1 had left the bench before he
! arose.
