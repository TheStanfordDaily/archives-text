# STANFORD WILL 'SHOOT WORKS' IN U.S.C. GAME
## Warner “Rests" Varsity As Trojan Fracas Nears; Reserves Work "POP" HINTS OPTIMISM Moffatt In Signal Practice; Glover In Hospital 
### LOWELL COX 
It's time for the "gather."
Seven games the Indians have
taken "in stride," but now, as a
track man "gathers" for the final
sprint, the Stanford gridmen must
prepare in a final week of practice
lor the supreme effort against the
Terrible Trojans at Los Angeles
Saturday.
Obviously building toward the
Southern California game, Pop War
ner has brought the team to mid
season without once breaking stride.
It was a good gamble—the Indians
have escaped defeat, although (hey
were twice tied.
Unknown Quantity
It is being called a "mystery"
eleven. Since it has not once been
brought to a peak, has seldom pre
sented maximum power against an
opponent, its real strength is un
known. At times the team has
shown flashes of brilliance, but for
the most part it has been no better
than ordinary.
But, you say, "how about Pop's
sleeve? What's up there?"
Certainly the Old Man has been
holding out this season. Certainly
much has gone on behind the high
green fence of the practice field that
has not yet come to light. And just
as certainly, Warner will "shoot the
works" Saturday.
But whether that frayed sleeve
conceals enough to stop the Trojans
is a Question that only the game
itself can answer.
"Pop" Noncommittal
Warner, who has been presenting
a consistently pessimistic front all
season, says: "We're not conceding
them the game yet."
You're dern tootin' he isn't—not
after pointing for Southern Califor
nia all season.
"We are going down there to give
them all we've got," the Indian
coach said yesterday, "but whether
that will be enough or not remains
Jo be seen. On paper the Trojans
look to be a better team.
"But, ' he added with what might
so regarded as a ray of optimism,
. 0 underdog comes through once
in a while!"
Varsity "Resting"
After last week's strenuous work
outs. Pop gave the first team a some
what easier time of it in practicc
yesterday, according to Don Lieben
dorfer, news director. The second
and third teams scrimmaged for h
while, with Glover receiving an
ankle injury in the process. He was
in the Palo Alto Hospital for treat
ment last night.
Phil Moffatt participated in signal
practice and looked as if nothing
was the matter with him. Phil Wil
son was still in the hospital with a
pulled tendon he received in Satur
day's game.
