WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. (JP)—'The
statement that Russia will withdraw
from the world wheat market for
two years, if substantiated, likely
will prove to be the greatest bull
factor that has come into the grain
trade since 1929.
Nils A. Olsen, chief of the Federal
Bureau of Agricultural Economics,
today said the Toronto Globe's copy
righted cable from Paris quoting
the Soviet ambassador to France
was "surprising," but that if it were
true that Russia will export no more
wheat this year or next, the face
"would seem to be of tremendous
importance and significance."
