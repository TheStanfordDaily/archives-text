# WHO WON WHAT?
## 
### 
The big athletic spree involving Mills, California, and
our own Five Hundred has just taken place for the first
and last time in two years. The near-competition of a
whole season was put through in one Saturday morning,
and by now even the luncheon rubbish is cleared away
from the women's gym.
This Triangular Sports Day, compromise between the
former mixed "plavday" and the hoped-for varsity system,
was supposed to have proved something. It did prove
something:
That the Junior ('.lass won—the juniors of the three in
stitutions together. All this boils down to the same old
slapstick of Stanford juniors having to help Mills juniors
beat Stanford freshmen. In this respect, it is no better
than the former absurd plavday, in which mixed teams of
Stanford, Mills, and California women were hitting at each
other, with divided loyalties and no goal, whatever.
That the Sports Day is too big a mouthful to be good
training food for athletes. One gulp, and go hungry for the
rest of the season. It resolves itself into a nuisance for the
campus which plays host (or hostess).
That — and this is most important — our sports cannot
get a decent chance. Hockey got something of a fair deal
because il happened to be the sport in season. Hut what
about basketball later, and tennis when it gets really good?
Swimming was on the list and Stanford was not ready for
ii, so one Stanford woman was entered in six ((») events.
(What happens to the argument against varsity competi
tion that features "over-exertion"?)
Later, because of the insistence on "interclass" teams
when California sophomores wer lacking a few "athletes,"
Stanford women were grafted onto the Cal team so that the
meet could go on.
And the juniors won. Won what?
