Self-si vied "100 best dutes" on 1 lie University of South
ern (lalifornia campus have formed an organization called
Ihe f>o-r>o Club with the purpose of forcing the women to
pay half of the hills incurred on dates.
The women are up in arms at what they consider, as
one co-ed put it, "one of the greatest insults ever ofTcrcd to
S.C,. women/' The women's threats lo boycott Trojan men
have called forth numerous caustic comments on both
sides and hopes for a compromise appear dim as the tight
continues.

friendship and friendly rivalry between Stanford and
I .S.C. hul after reading the aritcles in the Daily Trojan
«»n this male-female feud, il is forced to throw in the

impossible lo distinguish a I'.S.C. man from a'Hollywood

"Marv Ann Cotton, Pi Beta Phi, gave the co-ed's clarion
