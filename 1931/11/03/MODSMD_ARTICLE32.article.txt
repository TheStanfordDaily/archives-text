# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SILVER SCREEN IS TARNISHED 
### 
Someone once said that an opti
mist sees a silver lining in every
cloud while a pessimist bites it to
see if it is real silver. Paraphrasing,
one might say that no one except
studio publicity men and spineless
newspaper critics sees any silver on
the silver screen; and even they are
afraid to bite it because it may turn
out to be tinsel.
That the movies may have had a
chance to become a great civilizing
force is now very ancient history;
that a few reels are used in educa
tional work is interesting; but that
the moving pictures, by and large,
are not only a slur to our intelli
gence but a positive /degrading in
fluence on the populace must be ac
cepted as a sad truth but a truth
none the less. Once heralded as a
medium that would be able to bring
the best in dramatic art to the small
towns that could not afford to at
tract first-rate legitimate companies,
the movies have fallen into the
clutches of individuals that have
capitalized their new-found inven
tion to the tune of millions.
From a dramatic standpoint, the
studios seem to be putting out an
increasing number of worse than
mediocre films. The central factor
of the average movie is hopelessly
limited. An expensive display of
persons or property or both—the
so-called spectacle film whose sole
claim to fame is the expenditure of
many millions of dollars, upon it—
is common. A big volcano or fire or
earthquake scene or any "shot" re
quiring a big cast is sure to be a
success; *not only does such stuff
provide excellent material for ihe
publicity department but it causes
the yokels to gasp, "Wonderful";,

and think that they are getting their
fifty cents worth. Another "sure
fire" film is one that capitalizes on
some famous author or book; and
the produces a hashed-up version,
|so metamorphized by "Hollywood"
I influences that the original is hard
ly recognizable. The last and most
popular Hollywood theme is the
! basic, ordinary, but never-lagging
subject—sex.
The producers like to term these
I sex-films "romances"; but if Clara
; Bow and her like are romantic, then
I Sir Walter Scott and Alexander
Dumas were surely two high-pres
sure bunko artists. These films have
| permeated our very lives and com
j pletely warped our sense of the ro
mantic; the movie standards have
become life standards. She has Bow
j legs; or the-Garbo languor; or she
kisses like Shearer; the Buddy
Rogers smile; the Gable approach—
; all of these have been grafted on to
! human judgment leading to the per
version of taste, and preachers say,
the lowering of morals.
Of course, making movies is a
business and not an art; and as the
purpose of business is to make
profits, it might seem as if the
Hollywood tycoons were justified. A
couple of boudoir scenes or the like
will make a movie "click"; but the
! public has shown its appreciation of
j good films, sexy or otherwise (and
a sexy film may be an excellent pic
ture at times). The movie producers
i owe it to the public not to seek the
path of least resistance—not to just
i flash a couple of shots of Jean Har
low and call it a day. A little care
and selection can result in pictures
! that are good and still profitable.
