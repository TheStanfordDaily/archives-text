THE CHAMPION FROM FAll
AWAY—By Ben Hccht. Covici-
Friede. New York. 1931. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
This collection of sketches from
the pen of the author of such re
lentless acidities as 'A Jew in Love"
and "The Front Page" seems dis
tinctly inferior. Only one of the
stories has any of the Hechtian sting
and even this trails off into com
parative impotence before it is com
pleted.
The tales seem to fall most easily
into two classes: there is the popular
short story which might conceivably
have been accepted by the staid
M. l'Editeur of Liberty or Collier's;
then—far more dangerous—there is
the type which reminds one acutely
of compositions by Engineering stu
dents who have read too much of
Edgar Guest, A. A. Milne, and E. W.
Burnett.
Interesting by way of comparison
with this collection is the recent re
print of Hecht's sketches, "1001 Af
ternoons in Chicago." They are
more fragmentary, more common
place, even more negligible.

THE WINDING LANE—By Philip
Gibbs. Douhlcdny, Doran & Com
pany. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
This is not "more than must be
told" by any means. It would never
have been, missed if it had not been
told at all. "The Winding Lane" is
one of those books in which Gibbs
writes at length about very little.
He seems to have lost the strenglh
that marks the writing in his war
books. It is as though he had written
himself out of subjects that inter
ested him. "The Winding Lane" con-

tains some good bits of description, |
some realistic character sketches,!
and some interesting discussions but '
as a whole it is ineffective and not j
half what Gibbs can do.
The story is of a young writer who j
tries to bury himself in the country
so that he can work. He is wholly
unsuccessful so the story is mostly
about his reactions to the many !
types cf people that intrude on his ;
privacy. Newspapermen, artists, and j
ladies, assoi'ted, seek Francis Bran- j
don out and discuss him and his
work endlessly.
We think that any one of the 51 j
chapters is better than the book as i
a whole. —E.T.P.
