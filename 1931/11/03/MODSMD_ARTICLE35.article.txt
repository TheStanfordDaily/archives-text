## THE 						KAISER'S PIG 
### 
. A recent Associated Press story
I tells how the Kaiser sent a prize pig
j to England which was kept from re
| turning home during the war. Later
i the Kaiser, demanding his pig, was
sent a bill for its keep. The remain
der of the story, however, has just
been uncovered and can now be
told in historical form.
When the Kaiser received the bill
for the pig's keep he unexpectedly
admitted that the claim was just,
but in a special cable pointed out
that his secret operative DXGI had
found that the pig had produced
several offspring, among them Jen
nie, 810 pounds, and also Rosy and
Harry. All three of these had been
sold at good prices, and Jennie had
won a blue ribbon and cash prizes
at the pig show. In view of this, he
demanded that England balance the
cost of the pig's keep with the value
of the second generation of pigs.
On April 2, 1916, England for
warded a note to Germany declaring
that the offspring of Wilhelm's pig
had been a drain rather than a
source of income. They asserted that
Rosy, having caught the pig plague,
had spread disease to large numbers
of English pigs and consequently
raised the price of pork and hide.
No more ingenious answer is re
corded than that of the Kaiser which
was received at Downing Street the
next day. Freely granting that
Rosy's malfeasance raised the price
of hide, he declared that the in
creased price led directly to inven
tion of hide substitutes, an inven
tion which Britain itself valued in
millions.
While inner circles in London were
thus thrown in confusion, Arthur
Hepley, an assistant secretary, came
forward with a suggestion which
saved the day, if not the pig. The
Kaiser's pig was a father pig, he
shrewdly pointed out, but was not
the mother of the three child pigs
an English pig? Did not this invali
date the Kaiser's claims on Rosy?
But Berlin stood firm, sending
notes to the effect that this fact
certainly did not prove the second
generation of pigs English. In fact,
the greater responsibility for them
lay with the German pig. Downing

Street would not agree with this
statement, and throughout the year
debated the question, finally ending
when a compromise was reached
stating that the three pigs were of
divided sovereignty and that both
sides would temporarily drop claims.
After his exile to Doorne the Kai
ser revived the question, and on
May 3, 1921, sent the cryptic mes
sage to London: "I want my pigs."
A careless operator changed this to
read "pig," so that England neglect
ed to inform the Kaiser that if he
claimed Rosy he also must claim
three thousand pigs of the â€¢ next
three generations, many of whom
had been turned into American
footballs. In later notes the pig is
referred to as swine.
Apparently the Kaiser has for
gotten his pigs, but there are those
in Europe, including Premier Abra
ham Ritzstein of Poland, who pre
dict the Kaiser's pig will cause the
next great war.
