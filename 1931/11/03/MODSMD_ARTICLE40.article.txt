THOSE BRUINS really came north !
with the idea of winning Saturday's '
game. A win over Stanford was to j
be their first major conference vie- i
tory and the high spot in the fourth i
year of Bill Spaulding's "five year j
plan."
They played nil inspired game j
and deserve a hand for it. So
much did tliey have their hearts J
sets on at least a tie that tears
flowed freely when Colvin
nabbed that last pass.
Judging from the number of soph
omores used by U.C.L.A., Spaulding
should begin to make real trouble
for unwary conference teams about
next year.
THAT TACKLE-OUT-LAT
LKAL never worked better than
when it sent Afflerbaugh around
end for 18 yards and a -touch- 1
down against the Bruins. It was
timed perfectly and had unusual
deception. Tried later it netted
another six yards. Wonder if it
will work against the Terrible
Trojans.

A DIFFERENT STORY might
have been written about Saturday s
game had Hardy missed one tackle.
On the first play they had the ball
after their touchdown, the Uclans
opened a neat hole for Keeble at
center. He spurted through so fast
the halfbacks couldn't touch him,
and only Hardy remained between
him and the goal line. But Hardy
nabbed him after an 18-yard gain.
FIREWORKS are promised in
Pacific Coast Conference football
this Saturday after a quiet week
end featured only by the U.C.L.A.
scare.
With all members of the "big
four" in action against each
other, the title race may be
sewed up or thrown wide open.
A win over Stanford would
clinch matters lor (he Trojans,
while an Indian victory would
leave both teams and half the
rest of the conference very much
in the running.
While the Stanford-U.S.C.
game will take the spotlight,
that Washington-California af
fair over at Berkeley promises
to be a large contest. It will
make one team and break the
other.
IF YOU ask us:
GEORGE T. DAVIS gets more ap
parent kick out of a football game
than any other sports writer we j
know.
DOUB looked good at his old end (
post Saturday until the Bruins j
pulled those fatal end runs.
NEILL, at the other wing, showed j
some of his old-time fire, but was |
blocked in once while the West- j
wooders paraded 20 yards around his !
end in the first quarter.
DON LIEBENDORFER must have !
had the heck of a time keeping his j
voice to normal during those
last two passes Saturday. •
