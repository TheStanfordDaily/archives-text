# Little Big Game Here Saturday
## INDIAN BABES TO PLAY UNDEFEATED BEAR FROSH TEAM Freshmen Will Provide Grid Entertainment While Varsity Is Away 
### 
"With only the Stanford freshmen
obstructing their meteoric path to
ward an undefeated season, the
California Bear Cubs will journey
to the Farm Saturday for their an
imal Little Big Game. While ihe
varsity is engaging U.S.C. dov/n
south, the battle of the babes will
hold the athletic attention of the
campus.
The Cardinal team looked little
more than fair against an inferior
team Saturday. One thing may give
supporters of the Indians a modi
cum of enthusiasm; that is the fact
that Coach BracLshaw used a num
ber of men in the Contest, and at
no time after the first quarter was
the team at complete strength.
The work of Flippen at right half
Saturday was reassuring. He made
a number of nice gains and his
backing up of the line was no cause
for worry. Not very large is this boy
Flippen, but he is a willing worker
and he stamps into opposing ball
carriers with all his weight behind
the effort.
Moore fits nicely into the situa
tion in the fullback position. Der
ringer has played most of the sea
son on the bench but appeared to
be worth his salt on the field last
Saturday. Butts romped away to
some neat gains against Moran and
is due to get another chance against
the Bears. If anything beats ihe
Bears it will be sheer fight.
