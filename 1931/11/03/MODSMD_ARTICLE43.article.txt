# MALONEY'S VARSITY REST AS RESERVES WORK; MOORE HURT
## 
### 
| Following Saturday's hectic strug
: gle with the Bears from Berkeley,
| Coach Harry Maloney gave the var
! sity soccer men a rest yesterday and
I concentrated on the second and
i third strings.
Practice was somewhat dampened
| when Johnny Moore, star center
j half, who was the main cog in the
j 3-1 victory over the California
| kickers, showed up on crutches. The ,
j extent of his injuries had not been 1
| determined, but he received a badly
| battered foot early in the first period i
j of Saturday's game.
j If Moore's trouble is only a
I strained ligament, he should be in ;
- shape for the second California
game, a week from Saturday. If it '
is a broken bone, as the medics
tear, it will be a distinct setback to 1
Stanford's championship chances, j
Both San Mateo and California have i
strong teams this year, and both are j
set on upsetting the so-far unde
feated Indians.
