# BUGGE ANNOUNCES DEADLINE IN NOVICE TENNIS TOURNAMENT STARTING ROUNDS
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge announces
that today is the last day to settle
first- and second-round matches in
the novice tennis tournament, and
everyone who has yet to gain the
third round must do so before to
morrow morning or be defaulted so
that the tournament may continue.
Eleven men are at present in the
quarterfinals in all divisions —three
freshmen, five sophomores, one jun
ior, and two seniors. Three pairs of
these are opposite each other, all
set for the semifinals; Powell plays
Ransom, Webster is opposite Melc
zer, and Hirayama meets Williams.
Tournament Slow
Play in the tournament has slowed
up again. Not a single freshman or
junior match was settled yesterday,
and only five between the sopho
mores and seniors combined. Dodge
was defaulted into the sophomore
quarterfinals by Knecht, and Young
pulled up into the same round after
a 6-3, 6-3 match with Cherry. That
is the size of sophomore activity.

One of the three senior contests
was decided via the default route
also, when Ferns gained the second
lound over Webster. Bergstrom ad
vanced into the third round by vir
tue of a 6-3, 6-4 score with Brem,
and Fisher eliminated Ho in 6-0,
6-0 speed to gain the third round.
Last Day
Matches which must be by
tonight or suffer default are the fol
lowing: Freshmen —Pinckney vs.
Barnard, Zucco vs. Jadarola, Nelson
vs. Cooke, Walters vs. winner of
Nelson-Cooke match, and McFar
land vs. Anderson.
Sophomores—Martin vs. Owens.
Juniors—Hanson vs. French, Wood
worth vs. Hi!!, Moore vs. Wallace,
Reed vs. Healy, Woelz vs. Day, and
Gratiot vs. Irsfeld. Seniors—Ferns
vs. Davens.
Some of these players will have
to take the court twice today to
settle both their first- and second
round encounters. Saturday is the
date set for default of the third
round matches remaining unplayed.
