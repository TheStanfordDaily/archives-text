# LABOR ASKS FOR CONFERENCE WITH RAIL EXECUTIVES
## Meet Seeks To Stabilize Employment; Fights Lowered Wages 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. (A')—A
conference with railway executives
to seek ways of stabilizing employ
ment and wages was sought today
by representatives of 21 national
railroad labor organizations.
This action was taken after an
all-day meeting of the labor leaders,
who represent 1,250,000 employees.
A resolution proposing the confer
ence was transmitted immediately to
R. H. Aishton, chairman of the As
sociation of Railway Executives,
whose headquarters are here.
What position the executives will
take on the proposal was not made
known. Some of the labor leaders
said, however, a similar suggestion
Ihey advanced last summer proved
fruitless.
Unemployment was described as
the most important of 28 subjects
listed for discussion by the labor
leaders as they began a three-day
meeting today. A total of 350,000
railway employes were said to be
out of work.
The labor representatives at a
meeting here last July warned that
they would oppose to the utmost
any efforts to reduce wages.
While today's conference was in
progress, Daniel Willard, president
of the Baltimore and Ohio, proposed
to a Senate Manufactures Subcom
mittee that the transportation act
bo amended to permit railroads to
retain high earnings in prosperous
years to tide them over lean years.
Under the resolution adopted by
the labor group, the conference
would consider "any proposals af
fecting railway operations which
railway managements desire to ad
vance and any proposals, including
present and future relief of unem
ployment and stabilization of em
ployment, which this association de
sii'es to advance."
It also pledged the organization to
"carry on co-operative action . . . .
in aid of each and every organiza
tion of employees affiliated with this
association to protect and to pro
mote their common interest in meet
ing the needs of the present situa
tion."
