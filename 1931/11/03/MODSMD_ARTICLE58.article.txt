# ROOSEVELT CALM AS CLASHES RACK BOURBON LEADERS
## New York Governor Shows Presidential Campaign Race Possibilities 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 2. (/P)â€”Appar
ently the only man in the country
who doesn't know that Franklin D.
Roosevelt is a candidate for a presi
dential nomination is Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
An hour's visit with the alert, cor
dial, cautious New York gov
ernor in his office at Albany yielded
one unusual result. It revealed an
almost shocking state of ignorance
on his part regarding the flattering
growth of interest displayed by
Democrats in his attractive qualifi
cations for presidential honors.
Governor Cautious
The governor is perfectly willing
to discuss with convincing enthusi
asm state problems. But he draws
a line on such alien subjects as na
tional politics. He does not intend to
cross any bridges until he reaches
them.
Is he receptive candidate for the
presidential nomination of his party?
Will his name be entered in presi
dential state primaries where there
are no "favorite sons"? If the New
York Democracy decides again to
submit the name of A1 Smith will
Governor Roosevelt for the third
time present the name of the
"Happy Warrior"? Is there rivalry
between Smith and Roosevelt for
the presidential nomination?
Denies Entrance
On the first point, Governor
Roosevelt declared in a public
statement four months ago that he
was not seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination. That state
ment still stands.
The governor has not authorized
any individual or group to enter his
name in the presidential lists. Such
ventures are self-imposed by the
authors and promoters. Roosevelt is
at present only concerned with the
task of making a good job out of
his present one, he says.
