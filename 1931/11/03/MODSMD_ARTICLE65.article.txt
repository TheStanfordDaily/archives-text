# FARM SWIM STAR UNOFFICIALLY SETS NEW COAST RECORD
## 
### 
I After three cloudy days of doubt,
I the Daily finally has been let in on
1 the secret that McKelvey's real time
I last Thursday was no less startling
1 a figure than 53.5 seconds! This
, breaks the Pacific Coast Intercolle
, giate record for the 100-yard free
i style unofficially. The present rec
ord of 54.8 is held by Tuppy Gard
ner, McKelvey's teammate.
Not only that, but the Cardinal
j star's effort comes within .4 seconds
j of the national intercollegiate mark
i now held by Kojac of Rutgers, who
[is one of the world's outstanding
j swimmers, since Johnny Weismul
ler's retirement. If McKelvey im
proves at this rate he is likely to
scrape pretty close to that national
record of 53.1, or Stanford may even
find a national swim mark in its
possession before the season is over.
There will be no time trials Thurs
day of this week.
