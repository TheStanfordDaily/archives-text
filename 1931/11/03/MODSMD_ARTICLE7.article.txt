# VIEW ELECTIONS AS 1932 INDEX
## Democrats Fight To Break 12-Year G.O.P. Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. (&)—The
nation is awaiting tomorrow's "off
year" elections to gauge the drift of
the 1932 presidential campaign and
to learn whether the new House
will be Democratic or Republican.
Democrats are making serious
threats for two of three vacant Re
publican seats in the House. If they
won these, the twelve-year-old Re
publican rule of that branch of Con
gress would be ended.
Hoover Bourbon Target
Of course, the national Republican
administration has been a target of
the Democratic attack. Tomorrow's
results will inevitably be interpreted
as an expression of the public atti
tude toward the President.
Democracy has her worries in the
dispute up in New York between
two of her most outstanding leaders
—Alfred E. Smith and Governor
Franklin D. Roosevelt. They are at
odds over a forestation amendment
to the state constitution to be voted
upon tomorrow.
Five Scats Vacant
National Democratic leaders are
seriously pondering the effect of this
vote on the Democratic presidential
race of next year.
Governor Roosevelt is riding a
Democratic presidential boom. As
the 1928 nominee, Mr. Smith is re
taining his titular leadership of the
party.
Five vacant scats in the House
will be filled tomorrow. Three of
these were held by Republicans. The
election of one Republican and of
two Democrats is conceded by party
leaders.
