I Every one who plans to be in the j
! 1931 Ram's Head Football Gaieties j
j must report for tryoutsjn the Little
| Theatre between 3 and 5 j
o'clock. It is not necessary to have
| prepared a song or skit.
Dancing specialties, songs, and j
monologues are still wanted. Any- ;
one having anything that hasn't been
I turned in yet should see either Eph
; Engleman, who is in charge of the I
skits, or Harold Helvenston, who j
i has charge of the entire production, j
i At the preliminary tryouts last
i week several very good songs and
skits were presented. Acts which 1
| were only partly completed at that j
i time will be considered again by I
i Helvenston and Engleman this af- :
ternoon.
Roger Sumner, musical director, i
I still has a few "spots" in the show I
! for blue or fast numbers.
