FULL
WEATHER
When you'd like to pull in your feet as well
as your ears, then it's full brogue weather and
you've forgotten to get your Walk-Overs. Stop
in today. Be ready for the first shrill Mast
from the north or from the football referee's
whistle* Either one is the signal for these sporty
looking, plump leather, stout soled brogues.
