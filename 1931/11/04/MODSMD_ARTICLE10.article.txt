# CUNHA TO BE SPEAKER AT 'PEP' RALLY
## Parade From Fiji House To Pavilion To Send Off Festivities Tonight 
### 
Promptly at 7:05 o'clock tonight
Indian rooters will settle down to
business about this Trojan massacre
Saturday with a huge parade com
mencing in front of the Fiji house,
which will arrive at the Basketball
Pavilion at 7:30 o'clock to launch
off the annual S.C. pep rally.
"This is the most important game
in recent years," declares Ed Boyles,
chairman of the Rally Committee.
"We want every student to be down
in that Pavilion, to show "Pop" and
the team that we are more than
'just interested.'"
Cunha to Talk
Right on top of this statement
comes the news that Ed Cunha,
prominent San Francisco lawyer and
former yell leader and student body
president of Stanford University,
will head the list of speakers for
the evening. Cunha is a "fight
talker" of considerable reputation
and hopes to instill plenty of de
termination into his audience of loy
al rooters.
Festivities will open with the band
breaking the ice playing "Stanford
Forever" and "Come Join the Band."
During the second number* Pop
Warner and Harry Hillman will lead
the varsity into the Pavilion. After
the yells have been executed, the
glee club will lead in singing the
"Trojan Horse" scng, "Hail Alma
Mater," and "On Men of Stanford."
Boyles urges that every one learn
these songs before the rally, and
suggests that the various eating or
ganizations polish up on them dur
ing dinner hour tonight.
Quartet Will Sing
Following the yells and songs, the
Cardinal quartet will offer two spe
cialty numbers, "I Got Shoes," and
"Desperado."
Carl Cartwright's "What Ho!
U.S.C." skit, starring Anthony,
Shidler, and Cartwright, will ap
pear next on the program, and will
be immediately succeeded by the
main speaker of the evening, Mr.
Cunha. Among the other notables to
speak are Mike Murphy, Don Ro
besky, Dud DeGroot, and Biff Hoff
man. Captain Harry Hillman will
then take the center of the floor, to
be followed by Coach Warner, whose
talk will close the rally.
Pajamas Present
The frosh class will meet in pa
jamas in Encina lobby at 7:10 and
will proceed at once to the Pavilion
where they v/ill sit in a reserved
section, Verne Brown announced to
day. After the rally the yearlings
will parade over to Roble, and there
they will disband. Larry Harris,
head yell leader, will lead the pa
jamarino. Gordon White and Jerry
Hampton will assist.
An important departure from the
usual rooting section procedure has
been announced for the game Sat
urday. Instead of having the rooters'
cards tacked to the scats the Rally
Committee will distribute them at
the game after ihe students are
seated, Boyles said.
