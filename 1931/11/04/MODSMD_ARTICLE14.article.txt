# OPERA STAR'S CHARM, POISE WIN HEARERS!
## Grace Moore's Performance Warmly Applauded By Campus Audience 
### Mary Louise James 
Radiant and exquisitely poised, j
Grace Moore, prima donna of the i
j Metropolitan Opera Company, sang j
; to an enthusiastic campus audience j
last night—her first appearance be- ;
' fore a college group since her musi- I
j cal comedy days.
Miss Moore is emphatically a mu- i
| sician worthy of high regard, capable 1
of expressing various emotions with |
! equal ease. The warmth of her per- ;
i sonality alone is appealing, and she
jso strongly feels the rhythm and !
character of each of her songs that 1
! she shines as a finished actress as j
! well as an artist.
In Handel's "Come, Beloved," and j
i Griffe's "By a Lonely Forest Path- j
way," the lovely floating quality of
' her true lyric soprano was finely
j stressed; and in "Toi Seule" by j
Tschaikowsky she came near to at- |
taining perfection. Her one fault j
1 seems to come through an occasional :
: strained effort at dramatic volubility j
j which exceeds the actual capacity ;
1 of her voice. This made her rendi- i
I tion of "Botschaft" qf Brahms and ;
the Gavotte from "Marion" less en- '
joyable than other numbers.
Miss Moore displayed a glorious i
good humor in her buoyant singing 1
of Mozart's "Warnung," Delibes' •
"Bonjour, Suzon," and Purcell's j
"There's not a swain on the plain." j
Her excellent French accent and in
| tonation was especially outstanding |
in an Air from "L'enfant prodigue" i
of Debussy. The encores, two num- 1
i bers from her succcsscs in the talk- j
j ing-picture world, were enthusiasti- !
i cally received. Emanuel Bay played j
for her a series of invariably fine I
i accompaniments. • i
