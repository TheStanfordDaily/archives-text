Because Student Manager Al Denny protested that
| every cent of the additional money received by the Asso
| eiated Students this year is already budgeted, the Daily
did not ask the Executive Committee for its proposed If>
cent increase last night. Other A.S.S.l 7 . functions have
drained the treasury, so, this year at least, the Daily cannot
make its necessary improvements.
Circulation in Palo Alto, however, will he resumed re
, gardless of the cost, and the A.S.S.I'. must he prepared to
i underwrite the loss that it will entail under the present
j grant of (50 cents per student. Two years ago, when the
; Executive Committee allotted the Daily an extra 10 cents
| per student on the occasion of its increasing its size to
eight columns, the members recommended that the allot-
I ment be raised to 75 cents at the earliest opportunity. The
! A.S.S.I'. cannot spare that money now, hut next year, there
! will be no basketball pavilion note to pay off, and the Daily
' must seek the increase then. As a student function reach
ing the entire enrollment, il is as well entitled to necessary
funds as those activities which interest and concern only a
: portion of the student body.
