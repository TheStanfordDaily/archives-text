# Student Plaudits Thrill Visiting Concert Artist
## 
### BEATRICE BISHOP 
The plaudits of Stanford were to
Grace Moore last night "the biggest
ihrill in a long time." Years ago, in
her musical comedy days, she sang
to an audience of Yale men and
their professors. Not since then, in
the path of her concert career
through Europe and the cities of
the United Stales, has she chanced
upon a university audience, and last
night she found it "delightful."
If the Stanford roughs were un
usually gallant, it was as much out
of respect to Grace Moore's beauty
as to her smooth voice. Rough
blonde curls, brushed to satin sheen
on top; fading tan of a European

summer; Parisian gown that drooped
about her firm athletic body.
No chesty prima donna this; Miss
Moore exhibited the looks of a
Washington debutante, the poise of
a finished actress, and the vibrancy
of any campus favorite. She is a
sportswoman. And besides her hunt
ing lodge in Scotland, and her ranch
in California, she keeps a Park Ave
nue apartment, a villa at Cannes,
and a town house in Paris.
Motion pictures are pretty much
of a drudge as far as the blonde
singer knows them. "I had to learn
an entirely new technique for sound
pictures. And I found it difficult to
begin ns a star rather than an extra."
