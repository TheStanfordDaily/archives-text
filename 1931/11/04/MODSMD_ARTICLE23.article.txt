Frederick J. Koster, president of
the State Chamber of Commerce, j
last night told members of the Busi- !
ness Club that the way to succeed j
in the world of business today is to :
"capitalize on discouragement by I
turning it into energy that will aid ;
you in reaching your end."
As the weekly Tuesday night din- !
| ner meeting of the club, H. Clay ;
! Miller, prominent San Francisco |
j business man, opened the program
i by introducing Koster, who spoke j
|on the responsibility of the indi- 1
I vidual and toward society.
"Responsibility for success de- j
| pends solely upon yourself and the
! degree to which you succeed is |
| yours to determine. Progress of the j
nation as a whole is interlocked with
the aggregate responsibility of I
every citizen," stated Koster. He'
continued, "Don't equip for the fu- j
ture as there is "no future in sight. ;
i Through life every one of us will I
|be laying bricks for a structure
• which will never be finished. While j
it may become more beautiful and
useiul as time goes on, it can never
be completed."
Koster began his speech by ex- !
plaining that at the age of 15 he was j
"a horny-handed cooper's assistant j
and as such gained his first experi- '
ence in the business world." He said j
also that he "believed that in the !
Far West, California, and Stanford j
j in particular, that the opportunity '
I to become ready to assume the re- '
| sponsibility of every citizen was ex- !
j ceptionally good."
McDowell closed the meeting and j
announced that the speaker for next j
week will be Miller, who introduced j
1 last night's speaker.
