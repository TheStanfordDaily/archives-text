# Mystery Eleven Needs 'Fight' To Conquer Trojans
## Pop Warner Perfecting Fundamentals in Scrimmages Between Grays and Varsity; Working for Airtight Defense, Strong Attack AFFLERBAUGH AND GLOVER NOT IN UNIFORM Spartans Drilled in "Known" Indian Plays, Short Pass Has Given Most Troubleâ€”Cliff Herd 
### DICK RODDA 
; pOP WARNER'S "mystery eleven" may be able to pull a few touch
downs out of its untried has of tricks next Saturday, but it will not
win the Trojan game unless there is added to this an airtight defense.
1 And the best airtight defense is "fight." This was the kind used by Bill
Ingram's Bears in stopping the Trojans and it was also the kind used by
| the U.C.L.A. Bruins in holding Stanford last Saturday.
Warner has always built up a tremendous Cardinal offense for the close
of the season, but in the light of the Trojan massacre of last year, it might

- be expected that the Old Man may
' have something new in the way of
j a defense this year.
Stress Fundamentals
Pop has been stressing funda
! mentals much more than ever this
I year, further perfecting them by
! frequent scrimmages between the
( varsity and the Grays. All of which
| means that if Warner expects to
1 beat Troy this year, he is planning
jto do it by stopping the strong
! U.S.C. attack as well as by opening
i up a new Stanford attack.
| Last night the boys were drilled
I in a short defensive and offensive
! dummy scrimmage. The entire squad
| with the exception of Kenny Affler
-1 baugh and Tommy Glover was in
| uniform. AfTlerbaugh is suffering
| from a slight flu attack which will
I not keep him out of the game.
I Glover is still laid up with an in
: jured ankle received in Monday's
! practice and is not expected to be
| in shape for the Trojan contest.
MofTatt Okeh
Phil MofTatt is working regularly
1 on the first team this week and is
I expected to be in almost perfect
| physical condition for the tilt.
Reports from Southern California
1 indicate thtat the Terrible Trojans
| are also in good physical condition,
j Orv Mohler is back in a suit having
j recovered from a neck injury sus
j tained in the Bear contest. The elu
| sive back is said to be as shifty as
| ever.
Troy Lineup Same
The Trojan first-string lineup is
the same with the exception of one
end., josition, now being filled by
Johnny Baker, former guard, in
place of Ray Sparling. Arbelbido is
: still holding down the other wing
j post.
( Cliff Herd, assistant Trojan coach,
| has been scouting the Cards all sea-
I son and announces that he has the
Spartans well drilled in the "known"'
Stanford plays. The Cardinal short
| screen pass is giving the boys the
| most trouble, he says.
Dummy Scrimmages
Meanwhile, Stanford's preparation
I for the contest is expected to con
! tinue in the form of light dummy
scrimmages and signal workouts, if
Captain Harry Hillman hits the line
! as he. did a few weeks ago against
1 Minnesota and Santa Clara, it may
mean that Stanford's running of
fense will be enough to overcome
i the Trojans. It seems that whenever
| the Cardinal hard-hitting quarter
| back is at his best the halfbacks
also function better, slicing off three
, or four yards on each play while
I Hillman is consistently gaining two
| or three yards when it is his turn
i to pack the ball.

reported to have averted specula
