I LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3. (Special
jto Stanford Daily)— Knowing full
! well that El Trojan is going to need
' all of his manpower if he hopes to
keep the Indian out of his end zone
lon November 7 Head-man Jones
! sent his squad through a long but
J scrimmageless offense and defensive
1 practice tonight. The way the Tro
j jan mentor has been switching his
| first and second strings around this
i week has even got the News Bureau
j Czar, A1 Wesson, guessing who will
| start Saturday's classic. Jones gave
i the sports critics a little brain food
! tonight by using Johnny Baker at
| left end on the first string and at
' left guard or running guard on the
second eleven.
&ay Sparling, regular left flank
man, is still nursing his leg injury,
! and in case Baker starts at the left
i wing, Rosy Rosenberg will start at
running guard. John Dye and Larry
1 Stevens, two sophomores, are still
, fighting for the right hand post next
|to Captain Stan Williamson with
' Dye getting the call this week.
■ Despite the fact that the city
| dailies in the Southland are assur
, ing the world that Orv Mohler will
I play against Stanford, the medical
! staff are still shaking their heads
! doubtfully. Meanwhile the news that
| Phil Moffatt would be in the start
j ing lineup has not aided the de
j pression in Troy Town.
