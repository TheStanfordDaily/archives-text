# THE 						IMPORTANCE OF GRADES
## 
### 
Tn a certain class in this University, the instructor re- j
eel illy spent the greater part of a class hour in describing
methods of securing higher marks in that particular course.;
This instructor unblushingly outlined plans for getting j
the highest grade with the least work. Xo emphasis was;
placed on the real object of studying: the value to the
student himself of the material to which he is given access.j
(trades and marks have boon under the collective fire
of both students and faculty for years, and so far, little has
boon done to straighten out the situation, to give something!
of moaning to the empty husks. In the final analysis,
grades cannot give a true measure of value received, of
work accomplished, or student ability. Hut until a better
substitute is offered, grades will continue to pinch-hit.
The Daily believes that the above-mentioned instructor
\r either wholly unjust or else a very wise man.
The injustice lies in giving some students unfair ad
vantage over others. The perspicacity is evidenced in the
psychological approach to the sutdent mind. It is more
than a possibility that further development of the proce-!
dure will arouse interest among the students (ajid interest
begets) that good grades will become a matter of course.
