# THE
						LITTLE-BIG GAME
## 
### 
Saturday the smaller edition of the Hi# Game elassie is
stated to happen in the Stanford Stadium and all the dope
on paper points to a win for the Hear Cubs. In the mean
lime more than a third of the students are journeying to
the southern c lime for jubilation or gloom.
That leaves two-thirds of Stanford's loyal rooters on
hand to build up spirit for today's freshman team which is
tomorrow's varsity. The least that can be done this week
( nd is to be anion# those present to cheer for a possible
victory or to help lake the stin# out of a defeat.
