# BULL SESSION
## HOW ABOUT A NEW AUDITORIUM? 
### 
Every lime that a campus dra- !
matic production is presented, a few
people begin talking about the Ler- ,
rible status of the present building j
that is found hanging on next to j
the Administration Building. Every \
time the Chaparral has a few lines !
left on its editorial page, it calls at- |
tention to the fact that it has started i
a Theatre Fund. In fact, one of the j
most outstanding, perennial gripes 1
around the Farm is the lack of a i
beautiful and adequate Assembly I
Hall.
Passing by the appearance of the ,
Assembly Hall quickly—the quicker I
the better—we come to the accous- !
tics, or lack thereof. It seems that
actors are presented with the al- j
ternative of spoiling sensitive parts j
or going unheard in the hinterland j
of the Assembly Hall. Some choose J
one path, and some the other. Either
alternative is a serious indictment
to a cultural institution.
The horseshoe type of balcony
was very popular back in the days
when bustles and ornate carriages
were in vogue. But its antediluvian
character is evident at the present. ■
Not only does it permit roughs to
toss pennies and other less valuable |
objects on the stage with little ef- j
fort; but the situation is positively |
tempting to the most innocent- j
minded. At least a modern balcony I
would limit coin-tossing to the very '
proficient, which is some advantage, j
Then those that have to sit in the i
two "sags" of the balcony just sit j
there and trust to auditory sensa- |
tions and a virile imagination to in- j
form them as to what is taking place j

| one the platform—often called stage.
Then—the stage. It is small and
j does not permit all the uses which
| a full-sized stage would allow. A
; larger stage, a regular orchestra pit,
i would make possible many new and
! better attractions. Then this Utopian
| theatre of our dreams would be
i large. Its seating capacity plus its
i wonderful acoustics would permit
1 holding the concert series there in
! .stead of the Encina Gym. It is posi
l lively disconcerting to see the bas
| ketball black-board hanging pre-
I cariously over the artist's head; and
i the incongruity is too much—Beeth
\ oven and a basketball pavilion.
Now, who will furnish the money?
J The Chaparral is hopeful, but hope
I is too insecure a foundation for the
j mighty building we are planning.
J The Administration is always
j pressed for funds—with a huge
j campus to pay taxes on and little
| income being derived from that area,
j Always remember that only about
; 100 acres of this "Farm" is tax
j exempt. The B.A.C. is our only
I chance. They were able to build a
\ playhouse for the '"500" costing
| $225,000. Why can't the next liability
| that the B.A.C. will assume be some
j thing cultural?
j If this campus were to be covered
| with the silt of ages as was Babylon
I of yore, what would the archaeolo
i gist of that far day think when he
j started to dig in an institution of
j higher learning—an imposing struc
