### 
SISTER AIMEE—By Nancy Barr
Mavity. Doubleday, Doran & Com
pany. 1931. (At the Stanford
Bookstore.)
Two interesting facts may be
learned from reading this book, at
least one fact and one dependable
opinion: Mrs. A. S. M. Hutton is 41
years old—fact, and the dissension
between her and her mother, Mrs.
Kennedy, is sincere and not pub
licity stuff—opinion.
The book as a story of the sensa
tional Aimee is about what one
would expect from the erstwhile
sob-sister Nancy Barr Mavity. It is
written as a biography, psychologi
cal study, explanation, or what have
you. If Mrs. Mavity really succeeded
in analyzing the woman, that is, in
explaining scientifically why she is
as she is, the book would have some
value. Unfortunately we cannot help
noticing the sob-sister attitude in
truding into the writer's chronicle
of fact. Her point of view is re
flected in the title of the first chap
ter, "The Flamingo in ihe Chicken
Coop." Aimee is a scientific curi
osity and as such is good literary
material. When one feels that she
is played up as "human interest
stuff" he is revolted. —E.T.P.

THE MIRACLE WOMAN—At the
Menlo Theatre.
Barbara Stanwyck makes ''The
Miracle Woman" a distinct success.
A rather cleverly evident duplica
tion of the famous Aimee Semole
regime is played to perfection. David
Manners is the blind boy that braves
the lions for his love—he's good,
and so are the lions. —Y.B.T.

NORMAN DOUGLAS—By 11. M.
Tomlinson. Harper & Bros. 1931.
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
This is another one of those maga
zine articles that Mr. Tomlinson's j

publishers are able to sell to the
public in book form. But, as usual,
$2 is not too much to pay for even
a few pages of Tomlinson's deep,
•stimulating, beautiful writing.
It is not a biography; no new facts
about Douglas are offered, nor most
of the old ones. Tomlinson simply
analyzes the man on the basis of
his works. The result is that we
have an entirely different regard for
Douglas' attitude toward life.
The outcome of one great writer's
attempt to analyze another, particu
larly when that other is such an
elusive subject, is that Tomlinson
inadvertently tells more about Tom
linson than about Douglas.
The book is hand-set in a new
and unattractive type, Deepd.ene.

learned from reading this book, at
least one fact and one dependable
opinion: Mrs. A. S. M. Hutton is 41
years old—fact, and the dissension
between her and her mother, Mrs.
Kennedy, is sincere and not pub
licity stuff—opinion.
The book as a story of the sensa
tional Aimee is about what one
would expect from the erstwhile
sob-sister Nancy Barr Mavity. It is
written as a biography, psychologi
cal study, explanation, or what have
you. If Mrs. Mavity really succeeded
in analyzing the woman, that is, in
explaining scientifically why she is
as she is, the book would have some
value. Unfortunately we cannot help
noticing the sob-sister attitude in
truding into the writer's chronicle
of fact. Her point of view is re
flected in the title of the first chap
ter, "The Flamingo in ihe Chicken
Coop." Aimee is a scientific curi
osity and as such is good literary
material. When one feels that she
is played up as "human interest
stuff" he is revolted. —E.T.P.

THE MIRACLE WOMAN—At the
Menlo Theatre.
Barbara Stanwyck makes ''The
Miracle Woman" a distinct success.
A rather cleverly evident duplica
tion of the famous Aimee Semole
regime is played to perfection. David
Manners is the blind boy that braves
the lions for his love—he's good,
and so are the lions. —Y.B.T.

NORMAN DOUGLAS—By 11. M.
Tomlinson. Harper & Bros. 1931.
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
This is another one of those maga
zine articles that Mr. Tomlinson's j

publishers are able to sell to the
public in book form. But, as usual,
$2 is not too much to pay for even
a few pages of Tomlinson's deep,
•stimulating, beautiful writing.
It is not a biography; no new facts
about Douglas are offered, nor most
of the old ones. Tomlinson simply
analyzes the man on the basis of
his works. The result is that we
have an entirely different regard for
Douglas' attitude toward life.
The outcome of one great writer's
attempt to analyze another, particu
larly when that other is such an
elusive subject, is that Tomlinson
inadvertently tells more about Tom
linson than about Douglas.
The book is hand-set in a new
and unattractive type, Deepd.ene.
