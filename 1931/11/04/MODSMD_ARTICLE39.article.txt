stop the presses hang on to
your pulses grab the aspirin
bottle and dont breathe what
we mean is that at last finally
after months of talking and
weeks of working and voluble
curses and prayers for earth
quake on our part the whiff
whuit blang phooey gates ,on
palm drive are done at least no
more chiselers working on the
carvings we still think the best
part of the chiseling occurred
before we ever heard of it
nobody knows whether its the
| plague or an attack of shrimp salad
| but various and sundry roble spon
| sors and sponsees have been looking
awfully green around the gills the
| last Jew days we just thought you
j might like to know the reason but

| <
and tonight we have another
priceless opportunity to laugh
at anthony and the rest of the
funny chappie men when they
stage an act along with the use
rally they pay us to talk them
up so will you excuse it please
the real dope is that this rally is
) going to be one to tell your great
| nephews and granddaughters about
| if any and the main point is that

I can legitimately appear in pajamas
; in front of roble and serenade the
ladies of their dreams its a grand
| old custom
she was only a poor lumber
man's daughter but her limbs
were oak read it aloud and un
derstand
to the feeble-minded it would
J seem that somebody is capitalizing
| on a name by having a money mak
j ing tea at the far-famed hoover
mansion on hoover hill where presi
dent hoover used to live you know
but we know its really so ye coy
i coeds can show off to the world in
! general and impress the phi psis in
: particular when they traipse up the
: hill in their gorgeouse gownes to
! serve at the chrysanthemum tea
! more power
