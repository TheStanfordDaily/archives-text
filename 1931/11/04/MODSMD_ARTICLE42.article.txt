A score apiece in the first three j
minutes of play and another in the I
last live seconds were the thrills ,
that the Phi Sig-Sigma Nu battle j
offered the spectators in yesterday s j
intramural tag-foetball tussles.
The fireworks began popping |
when Ralph Ward well took the j
opening Sigma Nu kickoff and I
scampered 80 yards down the side
lines to chalk up the first marker
of the game. The conversion failed.
The Sigma Nus came right back j
after the kickoff and evened the j
count on three plays. The third, j
Parkin's toss to Polhemus, was good j
for 40 yards and six points. Parkin ;
converted around' right end.

tied down to enjoy their one-point !
lead. Everything went smoothly un- j
til the boys were all set to pick up ;
the pieces and go home.

this same speedy Wardwell caught j
a Sigma Nu punt on his own 40- |
yard line and galloped past the op
position to put the game on ice, !
