A score apiece in the first three
minutes of play and another in the
last five seconds were the thrills
that the Phi Sig - Sigma Nu battle
offered the spectators in yesterday's
intramural tag-football tussles.
The fireworks began popping
when Ralph Wardwell took the
opening Sigma Nu kickoff and
scampered 80 yards down the side
lines to chalk up the first marker
of the game. The conversion failed.
The Sigma Nus came right back
after the kickoff and evened the
count on three plays. The third,
Parkin's toss to Polhemus, was good
for 40 yards and six points. Parkin
converted around right end.
Sigma Nus Lead
From then on the Sigma Nus set-
tied down to enjoy their one-point
lead. Everything went smoothly un-
til the boys were all set to pick up
the pieces and go home.
But with five seconds left to play,
this same speedy Wardwell caught
a Sigma Nu punt on his own 40-
yard line and galloped past the op
position to put the game on ice,
12-7.
The Theta Delts and S.A.E.'s were
content to keep their scoring en-
tirely to the first half, with the
former coming out on top, 13-7.
S.A.E. scored when Triplett in
tercepted a Theta Delt pass on the
enemy 30-yard line and trotted over
for the score. Triplett also kicked
a goal.
Theta Delts Score
The Theta Delts' scores came as
the result of two long passes, Evans
to Wilson and Jensen, the second
after recovering an S.A.E. punt on
the opposition's 10-yard stripe.
Theta Xi toppled K.A., 21-0. Nich-
ols scored twice, once on a pass
from Frates, and again after inter-
cepting a pass on the 50-yard
marker. Frates scored the third on
a cut through left tackle. Theta Xi
converted all three of their scores
on passes from Frates to Nichols.
Two passes, Puthoff to Conger,
and another from Loomis to Cran
dall, served to put the skids under
the Alpha Sigma Phi's, as El Toro
emerged on the long end of a 19-0
score. The club converted on a pass,
Loomis to Mires.
The Breakers made it a perfect
day for the clubs when they took
the fast-stepping Japanese aggrega-
tion down the line, 20-0.
Burgess Stars
Burgess romped 40 yards, after
intercepting a pass, and Carl Reck-
nagel tore off 10 yards around end
to give the Breakers two scores in
the first half.
Gordon finished it up when he
tallied on a 20-yard toss from Vince
Phillipi. The conversions were
Phillipi to Burgess.
