IF YOU are one who gets a thrill |
i out of watching Ben Eastman run j
j the 440 in 48 seconds or less (and
.who doesn't), you should see the
i dog I'aces at Belmont.
Those pooches travel, and we |
don't mean perhaps. Stony PoinL, in
! winning the feature event Monday
night, negotiated the quarter-mile in
I 27 flat! Other times for that distance ,
i were :28 4-5, :27 4-5, and :27 1-5.
Two things have helped to
make dog racing popular — the
meets can be held at night, and
you can't bribe a dog. A crowd j
of 5000 attended the opening at
Belmont Saturday, and a fair
i sized crowd was on hand Mon
day night.

IN SPITE of the "depression," op
tion booths appear to be doing a
good business at the Bayshore track,
with exceptionally long odds occa
sionally rewarding bettors. In the
fifth race Monday Irish Paddy
sneaked in first when the two lead
ers started to fight near the finish.
Preferred options, costing $2.50,
were redeemed for $46.50 and $2.00
secondary options for $17.20. On the
ether hand, Sandy paid only $4.25
for preferred and $2.60 for secondary
options in the opening event.

THE RACES are run off with
great pomp and ceremony. An
orchestra plays while the gayly
clad grooms bring out their
prancing purps. and the whole
thing reminds of a colorful mu
sical comedy.

| TANFORAN, opening Friday,
; probably will cut into the attend
! ance at Belmont, but judging from
: the popularity of dog racing in other
parts of the country, the Bayshore
project should be a success.
SPEAKING OF Tanforan. the
forthcoming meet promises to be
the best held on the peninsula
since the inauguration of the
option system of betting. Faster
horses than have been seen in
any previous meet arc now
working out at the San Bruno
track.

"ALLEN TO COLVIN," says Max |
Plake in the Southern California j
Daily Trojan. "We'll be seeing you, I
: Colvin."
Yes, Max, you probably will.

THAT PASSING attack last
Saturday might indicate any
thing or nothing regarding Pop's
plans for his date with the Ter
rible Trojans. The Old Man may
have had Rintala throw passes
all over the field in the first half
to prepare him to take Allen's
place should the latter be in
jured—and that might mean a
sensational aerial attack at Los
Angeles. And then again, it
might merely have been a way
of holding back a running attack
being saved for U.S.C.
IF YOU ask us:
JACK DEMPSEY won't stage his
much heralded comeback against
anybody but the titleholder, who
happens to be Max Schmeling.
MAX BAER and Johnny Risko
will stage a great battle at San
Francisco Monday night.
RUDY RINTALA has SOME arm
—for baseball, track, basketball, and
football.
SLIP MADIGAN, St. Mary's
coach, would like a post season
game with Stanford with charity as
the excuse. Well, Well. —L.M.C.

Preferred options, costing $2.50,
were redeemed for $46.50 and $2.00
secondary options for $17.20. On the
ether hand, Sandy paid only $4.25
for preferred and $2.60 for secondary
options in the opening event.

THE RACES are run off with
great pomp and ceremony. An
orchestra plays while the gayly
clad grooms bring out their
prancing purps. and the whole
thing reminds of a colorful mu

| TANFORAN, opening Friday,
; probably will cut into the attend
! ance at Belmont, but judging from
: the popularity of dog racing in other
parts of the country, the Bayshore
project should be a success.
SPEAKING OF Tanforan. the
forthcoming meet promises to be
the best held on the peninsula
since the inauguration of the
option system of betting. Faster
horses than have been seen in
any previous meet arc now
working out at the San Bruno
track.

"ALLEN TO COLVIN," says Max |
Plake in the Southern California j
Daily Trojan. "We'll be seeing you, I
: Colvin."
Yes, Max, you probably will.

THAT PASSING attack last
Saturday might indicate any
thing or nothing regarding Pop's
plans for his date with the Ter
rible Trojans. The Old Man may
have had Rintala throw passes
all over the field in the first half
to prepare him to take Allen's
place should the latter be in
jured—and that might mean a
sensational aerial attack at Los
Angeles. And then again, it
might merely have been a way
of holding back a running attack
being saved for U.S.C.
IF YOU ask us:
JACK DEMPSEY won't stage his
much heralded comeback against
anybody but the titleholder, who
happens to be Max Schmeling.
MAX BAER and Johnny Risko
will stage a great battle at San
Francisco Monday night.
RUDY RINTALA has SOME arm
—for baseball, track, basketball, and
football.
SLIP MADIGAN, St. Mary's
coach, would like a post season
game with Stanford with charity as
the excuse. Well, Well. —L.M.C.
IF YOU are one who gets a thrill |
i out of watching Ben Eastman run j
j the 440 in 48 seconds or less (and
.who doesn't), you should see the
i dog I'aces at Belmont.
Those pooches travel, and we |
don't mean perhaps. Stony PoinL, in
! winning the feature event Monday
night, negotiated the quarter-mile in
I 27 flat! Other times for that distance ,
i were :28 4-5, :27 4-5, and :27 1-5.
Two things have helped to
make dog racing popular — the
meets can be held at night, and
you can't bribe a dog. A crowd j
of 5000 attended the opening at
Belmont Saturday, and a fair
i sized crowd was on hand Mon
day night.

IN SPITE of the "depression," op
tion booths appear to be doing a
good business at the Bayshore track,
with exceptionally long odds occa
sionally rewarding bettors. In the
fifth race Monday Irish Paddy
sneaked in first when the two lead
ers started to fight near the finish.
Preferred options, costing $2.50,
were redeemed for $46.50 and $2.00
secondary options for $17.20. On the
