# FROSH RESERVES TRY DEFENSE FOR REAR CUB ATTACK
## Babes In Tough Scrimmage With Menlo; Point For Little Big Game 
### Francis Hamilton 
Scrimmage with Dud DeGroot's
Menlo J.C. grid team was on tap
for the Stanford freshmen last night.
The babe reserves underwent a
strenuous workout while demon
strating defense against California
plays for the edification of the regu
lars.
After copious amounts of perspira
tion had dripped from the brows
of the understudies they retired in
favor of the so-called "A" team.
However, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
shied at risking his first-stringers
with the visitors, and the latter part
of the practice was in the nature
of dummy scrimmage.
Cubs Make It Easy
When those Bear Cub players line
up for the play things look pretty
simple and when the fireworks be
gin the backs amble around with
little apparent effort, but after the
play is completed, the distance to
the goal line is usually shorter by a
considerable amount. One wonders
how they do it. Probably Coach
Bradshaw figures that a determined
"bulldog" defense is the best style
of play against the Blue and Gold
yearlings.
Over at California the frosh beat
a powerful Sacramento Junior Col
lege team, 19 to 6, Saturday, and
the native enthusiasts are moaning
about the sudden reversal of form
displayed by the babes. At that, the
California victory was not too im
pressive. Two of the California
scores were made directly after in
tercepted Jaysee passes. Both times
long Bear passes paved the way for
the ensuing touchdown.
Cal Score Fluke
The third Californian score was
a mere fluke. A penalty on Cali
fornia gave Sacramento an addi
tional play after the gun was fired
at half time. The Sacramento quar
ter took a long chance and flung a
pass into the fiat zone where Meek
intercepted for the Bears and ram
bled 50 yards to make the score 19
to 6. On the other hand, Sacramento
made its lone touchdown on a
smooth 75-yard drive. During the
last half Sacramento held the upper
hand but was unable to score.
With a few breaks Sacramento
could have won that game, which
merely goes to prove that California
is not impregnable. A Stanford vic
tory in the forthcoming clash is a
l emote possibility, but don't count
the Indian babes out before the
game is played.
