# SOCCER UPSET IS CHALKED AGAINST FIRST STRING IN
## Cyril Johnson Stars For Winners; Frosh Try New Combination 
### 
Evidently still in need of some
thing else after their day of rest, the
varsity soccer team went down to
defeat before a fighting second
siring yesterday 1-0.
Behind the excellent work of Cyril
Johnson, ineligible center forward,
who would give any varsity outfit
plenty of trouble, the substitutes
kept the ball in enemy territory
most of the afternoon.

Coach Maloney announced that
j the injury to Johnny Moore's foot
j was merely strained ligaments, not
| a broken bone, as the doctors feared
j at first. The star center half will be
| out of the game for at least the
j rest of the week, but should be in
J shape for the next California tussle,
i November 14.
j The freshmen were forced to try
j out a new combination when Rojas,
[ center forward, turned up with a
! "charley-horse." With Widmann try
; ing the position for the first time,
j the yearlings wasted few moments
I on the third-string varsity before
Weaver, from his position at inside
right, drove one past Goalie New
man.
