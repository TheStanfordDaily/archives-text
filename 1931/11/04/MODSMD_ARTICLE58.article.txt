Stanford has no monopoly on the i
i "rough," for students at the Imperial j
i Univei'sity of Tokyo dress very j
' simply too, according to Professor
I Kyoji Suyehiro, who is giving a
j series of lectures on earthquakes in
i the Little Theatre. Some, sons of
| the rich, dress very elegantly, but
most do not.
, And many work their way
i through college also, but they do
I work which requires technical skill,
i such as tutoring or translating
j manuscripts. They do not do man
! ual work such as hashing.
| Japanese students are very much
I like American students, Professor
| Suyehiro said, They play football,
I not our kind, but Rugby and Asso
j ciation Football. Baseball is a major j
I sport, but basketball is not very I
| popular. In addition to these sports, j
I Japanese students fence, swim, and
I |
j
j

| practice archery. The national sport '
J of jiu-jitsu is of course well liked. !
Organized cheering such as is j
common at games in all American
schools is unknown in Japan, Pro- j
fessor Suyehiro said. But he thought j
it was fine when he attended a
game at the California stadium.
There are about 10,000 students in
the Imperial University of Tokyo,
and there are a number of other
colleges throughout the country.
The students are about the same
age as American students.
Tokyo University prints a weekly j
paper, and two years ago published j
a book commemorating its fiftieth i
anniversary. It does not publish an j
annual.
