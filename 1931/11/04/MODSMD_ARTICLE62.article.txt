# PLAN SUBMITTED CALLING FOR TWO TRAFFIC ISLANDS
## Scheme Will Be Means Of Better Traffic Control; Shell Lease To Go 
### 
Details of the plan for two traffic
j islands at the intersection of Uni
| versity avenue, El Camino Real, and
i Palm Drive were submitted late
j Monday afternoon by A. E. Roth,
| comptroller, and A. L. Trowbridge,
j assistant comptroller, to representa
| tives of Palo Alto. Delegates from
| the boards of public works and
| safety, and the city planning com-
I mission were present at the meeting.
It was 'maintained that in order io
j make the scheme effective on the
Palo Alto side of the highway a
portion of the Shell "Company lease
would have to be condemned at an
estimated cost of $3,000.
Plans call for two islands which
will be bound by concrete curbs and
planted in lawn. It is the belief of
the University officials that this
! change would not only add to the
beauty of the intersection, but would
form an effective means of traffic
j control.
The whole proposal was discussed
I informally after the presentation of
the plan, but no decision on the
matter was reached. It was decided
that a traffic expert should pass on
the plan before it was adopted.
