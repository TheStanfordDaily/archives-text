TRY RICHFSELD FOR "IT"!
During October we sold more gas than in any of the previous
17 months. Business is good for those with a £ood product.
Why not put Ilichfield to the test on that trip South for the
U.S.C. game? You'll find superior mileage, pickup, and speed.
Also better gel the "old crate" checked for oil and grease and
eliminate worry.
Whatever your needs we can meet them with competence, dispatch,
and moderate prices.
