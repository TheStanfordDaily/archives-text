# TROJAN HORSE STEALS LAUGHS AT PEP RALLY
## Chappie's Skit Outdone By Extemporaneous Stunt Of Thoroughbred 1500 FANS CHEER TEAM U.S.C. President, Hillman, Warner, Cunha Talk 
### Ron Kennedy 
"As a rally it was a wonderful
horse show —or was it?"
In that ringing statement is the
apt description of last night's laugh
riot in the Basketball Pavilion. It
even made Pop Warner laugh. He
not only laughed—he roared, he
giggled, he almost rolled in mirth.
And that is unprecedented at any
rally.
The whole horseplay fiasco began
when one of the faithful animals
quartered at the local stables, Mike
by name( he has been there 27
years and supposedly knows his way
around) was drafted into service as
a symbol of Troy in the Chappie
men's rally skit.
To his, the Chappie's, and the
Rally Committee's credit, bo it said
that he performed nobly and well,
but when it came time for him to
go, he wouldn't. And that was the
mere beginning. After all, it all went
to show that those Chappies always
have something up their sleeves,
ready to surprise even the most
blase of audiences.
Small Turnout
Before the incident (fortunate or
unfortunate, according to your
point of view) broke up the meet
ing, the small turnout of 1500 loyal
fans made the half-filled pavilion
ring with a remarkable amount of
noise in the yells, and music in the
songs. The Cardinal quartet got a
big hand for its efforts.
Ed Cunha, Class of '06, main
speaker on the program, told the
team to "go down there to the
Olympic stadium and put the old
axe right between the eyes of that
Trojan horse (applause) and bring
back his hide."
"Don't worry about what the
other team is going to do," he said.
"You have the goods—the real goods,
and you'll deliver. I know you'll
show the Stanford spirit, cover
yourselves with glory, and do the
job up right."
U.S.C. Man Speaks
Francis Bushard, president of the
U.S.C. student body, told the rooters
that "U.S.C. always feel it a high
honor to play Stanford, because you
maintain such a high ideal of clean
sportsmanship. We're al lout to play
a clean game, and no alibi's after
wards."
Dud DeGroot, captain in '19, said
that it was up to Stanford and the
team to "win that game."
Several former Stanford captains
spoke, and Harry Hillman summed
it all up by saying:
"We can beat them, and it won't
be an upset, either."
Warner Silent
Pop Warner, "profiting by ex
perience,'' declined to say anything
about Stanford's chances in the
game.
"I m glad everybody enjoyed our
rally," Ed Boyles, chairman, de
clared last night. "For the first time
in the history of Stanford the Rally
Committee was able to truthfully
and honestly say: 'You've got a
horse on me.'"
The frosh showed a little more
spirit than the rest of the school
in their own rally, for the Little
Big Game—the pajamarino. About
250 of them went to Palo Alto af
terwards and stormed the doors of
ihe Stanford Theatre. Manager
Harry Brown "talked nice" to them
and let them come in as "guests."
