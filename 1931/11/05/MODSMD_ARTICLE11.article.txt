GENEVA, Nov. 4 (/P).—'The five
demands made on China by Japan
as essential conditions for the evacu
ation of Manchuria all have been
met and therefore Japanese troops
should get out, Aristide Briand,
chairman of the League of Nations
Council, said in a note published
today.
On behalf of the Council M.
Briand called on the Japanese Gov
ernment to carry out its promise,
made to the Council in September,
by moving its soldiers back into the
railway zone as rapidly as security
conditions permit.
At the same time, Dr. Alfred Sze,
Chinese League delegate, repeated
his charge that Japanese troops are
tightening their grip on Manchuria.

Note Given Delegate

M. Briand's note, sent to Kenkichi
Yoshizawa, Japan's delegate to the
League of Nations, pointed out that
the Council voted, 13 to 1, ten days
ago that Japan should evacuate. This
action, Mr. Rriand said, "still retains
its full moral force."
Moreover, the Council chairman
said, the resolution of September 30
calling for rapid evacuation—a reso
lution which received Japan's sup
port— "retains its full executory
force."
The four demands concern mu
tual repudiation of aggressive policy
and conduct; respect for China's ter
ritorial integrity; suppression of all
organized movements interfering
wilh freedom of trade and stirring
international hatred, and effective
protection of the Japanese popula
tion in Manchuria.
The fifth point demanded "respect
for the treaty rights of Japan in
Manchuria." In this connection M.
Briand asserted that Dr. Sze had
acknowledged that "China is bound
by the covenant of the League to
scrupulous respect of all treaty obli-

gations
