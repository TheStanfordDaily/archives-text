# MOTHERS CLUB TEA IS SUCCESS
## Nearly Two Thousand At Rest Home Benefit 
### 
Approximately Iwo thousand peo
ple attended the Mothers Club an
nual Chrysanthemum Tea held yes
terday afternoon at the Herbert
Hoover home on San Juan Hill to
raise money for the support of the
Stanford men's and women's rest
homes.
A profit of $200 was made from
sales of home-made candy and nuts
which were donated to the Mothers
Club. All the flowers including those
used for decorating the Hoover home
were sold, bringing the sales total
for flowers, corsages and bouquets,
to $150. The new pictures of the
house taken especially for this oc
casion were completely sold out and
many additional orders taken. Or
ders may still be placed with Mrs.
A. W. Johnson, chairman of the pic
ture committee.
Decorations for the tea consisted
of elaborate floral displays with
chrysanthemums the predominate
note.
A committee of hostesses headed
by Mrs. Chester Thomas and Mrs.
Carolyn Edwards Hall received
guests, showing them through the
house and garden where 60 Stanford
women representing Cap and Gown,
the Y.W.C.A. cabinet, and the dif
ferent living groups served them
with tea.
The Stanford Band, playing a
group of college songs, furnished
the musical program.
Much of the credit for the success
of the tea goes to the committee in
charge of the general arrangements:
Mrs. A. E. Roth, Mrs. P. J. Treat,
Mrs. F. H. Fowler, Mrs. T. A. Storey,
and Mrs. Jean Howry Large.
