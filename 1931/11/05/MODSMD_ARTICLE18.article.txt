# BOURBONS WIN HOUSE CONTROL IN VOTE UPSET
## Shouse Predicts Democrat Landslide in 1932; Fess Confident

WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 </P). —
1 The three big political prizes of 1931
I —control of the House of Represen
j tatives and Governorships in New
Jersey and Kentucky—appeared to
night to have fallen into the lap
j of a Democratic party already mili
tantly organizing to bid for the big
gest prize of all in 1932.
Unless accident intervenes, the
veteran John Garner of Texas will
ascend to the House speakership
: when Congress meets next month,
and President Hoover will find him
-1 self confronted, as Wilson was in
the last two years of his term, with
hostile leadership in the revenue
voting branch of Government.
New Democratic Governor
A Democrat, A. Harry Moore, will
take the Governor's chair in New
Jersey, swept to power on a land
i slide of astonishing proportions, and
| Ruby Laffoon, also a Democrat, will
take the place of a Republican Gov
-1 ernor at Frankfort.
i Among the Democrats there was
much rejoicing and hand clasping.
| Jouett Shouse, the party's executive
chairman, saw certain presidential
i victory a year hence* House mem
bers, hungry for power after thir
teen lean years, were vocal in their
jubilation and unawed by the difFi-
I culties of legislation with a mem
-1 bership so close that the count
; stood tonight at 217 Democrats, 215
, Republicans, one Farmer-Labor, two
i vacancies.
G.O.P. Leaders Silent
On the Republican side, most
leaders were silent, but many said
privately that after all, House con
trol might prove to be more of a
burden than a blessing. Senator
Fess, national chairman, said there
was promise for '32 in the Republi
can retention of the old Longworth
district of Ohio, after a stubborn
Democratic effort to capture it.
The election figures had other as
pects of interest to every politician.
I One was the overwhelming adoption
|of Governor Roosevelt's reforesta
tion proposal* in New York State,
over the opposition of former Gov
' ernor Smith. Another was the great
numerical strength shown by the
| independent voter.
