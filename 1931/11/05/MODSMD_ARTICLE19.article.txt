"We have still much investigating
to do before we can hope to predict
earthquakes," according to Profes
sor Kyoji Suyehiro of the Tokio Im
perial University, who gave a series
of three lectures in the Little The
atre this week under the auspices of
the engineering department.
His lectures, which were illustra
ted with maps and lantern slides,
embraced the topics of "Earthquake
Researches in Japan," "Engineering
Seismometry," and "Vibration of
Buildings in an Earthquake."
Professor Suyehiro is touring the
United States under the auspices of
the American Society of Engineers.
The Japanese Earthquake Research
Institute, of which Suyehiro is di
rector, was established shortly after
the great earthquake near Tokio.
The Institute is showing to the engi
neering societies of this country the
results they have obtained in study
ing earthquake phenomena, and
means of mitigating the damage. In
his lectures, Suyehiro stressed dif
ferent branches of his studies, in
cluding seismometry, vulcanology,
geophysics, and geology.
