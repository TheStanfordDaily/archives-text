# Royal Mounted Charge Reds In Conspiracy Act
## Disguised Policeman Joins Communist Ranks To Gain Evidence 
### 
TORONTO, Nov. 4 (TP). â€”In the I
scarlet coat of a Royal Canadian i
Mounted policeman, Sergeant John ;
Leonard told from a witness stand !
today how for seven years he lived j
a dual life, posing as a communist j
and sitting in secret conferences j
where plots to wreck the govern- |
ment were being hatched.
Looking directly at nine commu- j
nist defendants .on trial for conspir- |
acy, the stalwart young officer told j
how he had worked with them, plot- i
ted with them, issued orders to them |
and taken advice from them.
"Pal" Testifies
He had led the dual life, he said, i
to maintain the tradition of his serv- j
ice and "get his men." He had acted j
the role so well he never was sus- j
pected.
His statement found support in the I
startled expressions of the defend- !
ants as they saw the man whom they !
had elected a fellow officer appear j
on the stand in the colorful coat, the |
striped breeches and high boots of J
the mounted police force.
The sergeant related that he had I
put aside his scarlet jacket, donned
the shabby clothing of a workman i
and changed his name to E. W. Es- ;
selwain after receiving orders to ob- I
tain evidence against the party.
Accepts Honored Post
He soon was elected secretary of i
the Regina branch of the Communist I
party of Canada and in that capacity
was admitted to the inner circle of |
officers who, he said, were in con- |
stant communication with Moscow, j
Many of the communications, he f
said, he had been forced to destroy \
upon orders from his communist su
periors, but before obeying he made
copies of them.
The defendants are charged with j
being members of an unlawful asso- |
ciation and with seditious conspir- |
acy. They face long prison terms if (
convicted.
