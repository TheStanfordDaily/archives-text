# Harry Hillman's Running Attack Cards' Bulwark
## Indian Aerial Show Rests Largely on Dusty Allen's Sending and Receiving of Moffatt and Don Colvin in Trojan Tilt Saturday STANFORD'S BACKFIELD WEAK THIS YEAR Pop Warner Will Not Send Squad South Until Friday Night, Contrary to Former Practice 
### 
VUITH Stanford's best backfield combination of Moffatt, liillman, Cadricl,
and Allen ready to perform as a unit the first time this season for any
long period, the Big Red Machine may function against the Terrible Tro
jans next Saturday as it did in 1!)2(> and before.
While Phil MofTatt is the most dangerous of these four hackiield
threats, much of the Cardinal running attack Saturday will depend upon
Captain Harry liillman. Hillman has placed consistently well at quarter-

; hack all season but in certain games
| his line plunging ability has been
1 outstanding.
! Pop Warner has built his offense
| around a hard-hitting back, so if
j Hillman is in form Saturday some
| one hundred thousand persons may
view an irresistible Cardinal driving
| attack against U.S.C.
; And if this fails to penetrate Ihe
j veteran Trojan forward wall, Pop
l can still rely on one of the greatest
! passing attacks on the coast. The
' success of this Indian aerial show
i depends largely upon Dusty Allen
! at the sending end and Don Colvin
and Phil MofFatt in the receiving
| department. From past perfoiraances
j this year we can safely say that this
j trio can be counted upon for all that
j is expected.
But the possibility of a Stanford
i victory over U.S.C. rests on some
j thing besides a perfectly co-ordinat
| ing backfield, and that something is
I a strong line. Stanford's line this
I season has not been as impressive as
I its backfield. The Card forward wall
! has let Santa Clara, Washington,
| and U.C.L.A. march through it for
i long gains. Therefore, Hulen, Bige
| low, Milligan, Ehrhorn, and Hand
i must give better than their best of
i fensively as well as defensively be
i fore the powerful Trojans will be
i subdued.
In order to keep his squad in its
present healthy condition Warner
I omitted even dummy scrimmages
! and signal practices in last night's
I grid session. The boys reported in
j civilian clothes and were given only
blackboard instruction.
AfTlerbaugh and Glover were the
' only members of the squad who
' were absent. AfTlerbaugh is recov
| ering from a slight touch of the in
i fiuenza while Glover is definitely
: out of the Trojan tilt, according to
Don Liebendorfer, news director,
i Glover injured his ankle Monday
j night and it is possible that he is
; through for the season. Phil Wilson,
| halfback, will also be missing for
j Saturday's game. Wilson was hurt
in the U.C.L.A. contest.
The squad will not entrain for
1 Los Angeles until Friday night. This
| is a new and probably wise idea of
j Warner. The team has usually de
] parted on Thursday to give the boys
a day to limber up in strange at
mosphere but the old man now be
lieves that it is inadvisable to spend
an extra day in foreign surround
j ings.

VUITH Stanford's best backfield combination of Moffatt, liillman, Cadricl,

long period, the Big Red Machine may function against the Terrible Tro
jans next Saturday as it did in 1!)2(> and before.
While Phil MofTatt is the most dangerous of these four hackiield
threats, much of the Cardinal running attack Saturday will depend upon
Captain Harry liillman. Hillman has placed consistently well at quarter-

; hack all season but in certain games
| his line plunging ability has been
1 outstanding.

view an irresistible Cardinal driving

; And if this fails to penetrate Ihe
j veteran Trojan forward wall, Pop
l can still rely on one of the greatest
