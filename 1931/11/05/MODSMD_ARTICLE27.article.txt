Yesterday, Enivcrsitv of (California students olliciallv
dedicated John Morion Eshleman hall, beautiful new pub
liealions building. Stanford can but stand back and ad
mire this imposing structure, gift of an alumnus, and otter
its congratulations upon this forward step.
On Tuesday, the front page of I lie Daili/ (lalifornian,
ollieial publication of the A.S.E.G., contained this lop col
umn lead paragraph:
"Galifornians will gather in the Greek Theatre Thurs
day evening for the thirtieth annual Pajamarino rally, held
each year FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF BREWING THE
"MATE STANFORD" SPIRIT FOR THE RIG GAME."
The capitals are ours, and ours, too, is the consternation
that this catch-phrase, sophoinorie hang-over of an excited
editor's mind, should have been revived by the present gen
eration of Rerkelevans.
Eighteen months ago, when the now-famous Twenty-
One regained the Stanford Axe from under the Galifor
nians' noses, the editor of the Daili/ (lalifornian, in the first
flush of anger and chagrin at the recovery, coined the idi
otic "Hate Stanford" phrase. It did not reflect the feeling
of the E.G. campus as a whole, and therefore died a hasty
and natural death.
II is one thing for the Daily C.alifornidii to stir the Ber
keley campus to lighting pitch for the Rig Game, but this
''Hate Stanford" stuff, if it is carried too far, is likely to
prove a boomerang that will whirl back and sock the dear
old Dai/i/ (lalifornian right on the snozzle. .hist keep it up,
fellows, and the Golden Rear will get himself chased right
out of the stadium as usual on November 21.
