Clark suggests that a reapportionment of A.S.S.U. funds
he effected at a special election, the Daily to get its re
quested amount after I lie reapportionment. The Daily,
grateful to Clark for his eH'orls in its behalf, cannot see its
way clear to approving such a move at this time.
There is no doubt that the student manager has already
budgeted all the money the A.S.S.U. lias to spend this year,
and reapportionment is out of the question at this date.
However, next year the A.S.S.U., beginning next year and
for each succeeding year, will have $i>,O(K) more than in
preceding years, and then the Daily cannot be denied. Now
if is not a question of the Daily's need, which is ever-pres
ent, but a question of where the money comes from. The
Daily can prove the first problem; the A.S.S.U. must solve
the second.
