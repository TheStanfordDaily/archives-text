# CARDS DEBATE TURKS TUESDAY
## Fascism And Bolshevism To Be Discussed 
### 
Invading the Stanford campus
Tuesday evening for the first de
bate between a Turkish university
and Stanford, two students of Rob
ert College in Turkey will meet lo
cal debaters on the question, "Re
solved, that the world has more to
fear from Fascism than from Bol
shevism."
After a year of work in American
colleges, A. Galib Rifat and Suha
Zeki have undertaken a debate tour
under the sponsorship of the Na
tional Student Federation of Amer
ica. Highly recommended as speak
ers of unusual ability and experi
ence by that organization, Rifat and
Zeki will meet Howard Conn and
Leonard Bloom of Stanford in a
contest that promises to be an event
in debating circles, according to
John Gange, debate manager.
Debating is a comparatively new
venture for the Turkish college,
where it was first introduced by
Zeki in 1928. In his senior year, in
1928-9, Zeki served as president of
the Turkish Society, and in that ca
pacity started debating as an ac
tivity of the society. His four years
of work at Robert College were
spent in preparation for entering
business administration work, and a
postgraduate course in the Gradu
ate School of Business Administra
tion at New York University gained
him his M.A. in June 1931. While at
the Turkish school he organized a
student staff to conduct evening
classes in the revised Turkish lan
guage for citizens from twenty to
sixty years of age.
At fourteen, A. Galib Rifat en
tered Robert College to study in the
School of Science and Engineering.
Elected to various offices in the
student organization, he also made
the college football team and took
an active part in debating and dra
matics. On a leave from Robert he
came to the United States for courses
at the University of Illinois and has
maintained a straight "A" record.
Robert College is located at Ru
meli Hissar, a suburb of Constanti
nople. It was founded in 1863 by a
New York merchant, Christopher
Robert, interested in education. On
a campus of 108 acres are built eight
class buildings and living quarters
for 600 students and the faculty.
The remainder of the 717 students,
registered in 1929, live in the city.
The college offers a six-year course
that may be completed in four years.
A diversified student body repre
senting countries from all over the
world is rivalled only by the fac
ulty which represents 19 nations.

guage for citizens from twenty to
sixty years of age.
At fourteen, A. Galib Rifat en
tered Robert College to study in the
School of Science and Engineering.
Elected to various offices in the
student organization, he also made
the college football team and took
an active part in debating and dra
matics. On a leave from Robert he
came to the United States for courses
at the University of Illinois and has
maintained a straight "A" record.
Robert College is located at Ru
meli Hissar, a suburb of Constanti
nople. It was founded in 1863 by a
New York merchant, Christopher
Robert, interested in education. On
a campus of 108 acres are built eight
class buildings and living quarters
for 600 students and the faculty.
The remainder of the 717 students,
registered in 1929, live in the city.
The college offers a six-year course
that may be completed in four years.
A diversified student body repre
senting countries from all over the
world is rivalled only by the fac
ulty which represents 19 nations.
Invading the Stanford campus
Tuesday evening for the first de
bate between a Turkish university
and Stanford, two students of Rob
ert College in Turkey will meet lo
cal debaters on the question, "Re
solved, that the world has more to
fear from Fascism than from Bol
shevism."
After a year of work in American
colleges, A. Galib Rifat and Suha
Zeki have undertaken a debate tour
under the sponsorship of the Na
tional Student Federation of Amer
ica. Highly recommended as speak
ers of unusual ability and experi
ence by that organization, Rifat and
Zeki will meet Howard Conn and
Leonard Bloom of Stanford in a
contest that promises to be an event
in debating circles, according to
John Gange, debate manager.
Debating is a comparatively new
venture for the Turkish college,
where it was first introduced by
Zeki in 1928. In his senior year, in
1928-9, Zeki served as president of
the Turkish Society, and in that ca
pacity started debating as an ac
tivity of the society. His four years
of work at Robert College were
spent in preparation for entering
business administration work, and a
postgraduate course in the Gradu
ate School of Business Administra
tion at New York University gained
him his M.A. in June 1931. While at
the Turkish school he organized a
student staff to conduct evening
classes in the revised Turkish lan
guage for citizens from twenty to
sixty years of age.
