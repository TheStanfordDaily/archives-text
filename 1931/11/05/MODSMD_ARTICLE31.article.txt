# BULL SESSION
## AND NOW THE FUN BEGINS 
### 
Death took a holiday; but it went
on its vacation with the Democratic
Party. In the elections ol' 1030, the
Republicans had managed to keep
control over the House of Repre
sentatives. Administration leaders
breathed; but it was sort of a short
breath, because the insurgent bloc
still had to be pacified. This group
of Republicans maintained the bal
ance of power and, to keep control,
the administration would have had
to throw some choice bits of meat
to these growling bears. But the
G.O.P. will not have to worry over
this question any longer, because
the Democrats now have a majority
in the House. Republican repre
sentatives died, and enough of their
places were filled by deserving
Democrats to turn the scale.
While it is true that the Sons of
Jefferson only have a majority of
one, they will probably organize the
House, and will be able to pass
measures as long as they stay away
from prohibition. The possibility of
winning the presidency and the un
usualness of the situation—Demo
crats in power—will probably keep
the party very solid on all votes.
If the wet members are smart, they
will hide their dampness under a
heavy cloak of depression relief
measures. However, it is very pos
sible that the Republican minority—
its wet members—will force the
prohibition issue just to split the
Democrats, which is usually not a
very difficult thing to do.
The Democrats—being in power in

only one house—are in a choice
situation—rare and delightful let
politicians. The Bourbons can pre
sent ail kinds of appealing relief
measures —many of which may not
be technically valid—which the Re
publican Senate will fail to pass; and
it not the Senate, then the President
will surely be forced to veto. In
short, the Democrats can come be
fore the people in 1932 with a long
list of measures which they would
have "desired" to pass and which
would have "cured the depression"
but which the cruel Republicans
failed to O.K.
And even if the measures pro
posed are sound, the Republicans
will be afraid to pass them for fear
that they will react to the Demo
crats' favor in '32. And on the other
hand, the Bourbons will be able io
block any legislation that the Presi
dent or his party may desire. Hoover
—as popular head of the nation—
will still be responsible for situation,
the Democrats can stop him from
curing if he did have a plan.
And better yet, if economic con
ditions get better before 1932, the
Democrats can claim part credit for
the recovery because they control
one branch of Congress.
And when Congress convenes,
watch the fun! The Republicans
were having a hard time deciding
who would be Speaker. The election
decided that for them. Death took
a holiday and brought back the
Democratic bacon.

the recovery because they control
one branch of Congress.
And when Congress convenes,
watch the fun! The Republicans
were having a hard time deciding
who would be Speaker. The election
decided that for them. Death took
a holiday and brought back the
Democratic bacon.
—Abe MellinkofC
Death took a holiday; but it went
on its vacation with the Democratic
Party. In the elections ol' 1030, the
Republicans had managed to keep
control over the House of Repre
sentatives. Administration leaders
breathed; but it was sort of a short
breath, because the insurgent bloc
still had to be pacified. This group
of Republicans maintained the bal
ance of power and, to keep control,
the administration would have had
to throw some choice bits of meat
to these growling bears. But the
G.O.P. will not have to worry over
this question any longer, because
the Democrats now have a majority
in the House. Republican repre
sentatives died, and enough of their
places were filled by deserving
Democrats to turn the scale.
While it is true that the Sons of
Jefferson only have a majority of
one, they will probably organize the
House, and will be able to pass
measures as long as they stay away
from prohibition. The possibility of
winning the presidency and the un
usualness of the situation—Demo
crats in power—will probably keep
the party very solid on all votes.
If the wet members are smart, they
will hide their dampness under a
heavy cloak of depression relief
measures. However, it is very pos
sible that the Republican minority—
its wet members—will force the
prohibition issue just to split the
Democrats, which is usually not a
very difficult thing to do.
The Democrats—being in power in

only one house—are in a choice
situation—rare and delightful let
politicians. The Bourbons can pre
sent ail kinds of appealing relief
measures —many of which may not
be technically valid—which the Re
publican Senate will fail to pass; and
it not the Senate, then the President
will surely be forced to veto. In
short, the Democrats can come be
fore the people in 1932 with a long
list of measures which they would
have "desired" to pass and which
would have "cured the depression"
but which the cruel Republicans
failed to O.K.
And even if the measures pro
posed are sound, the Republicans
will be afraid to pass them for fear
that they will react to the Demo
crats' favor in '32. And on the other
hand, the Bourbons will be able io
block any legislation that the Presi
dent or his party may desire. Hoover
—as popular head of the nation—
will still be responsible for situation,
the Democrats can stop him from
curing if he did have a plan.
And better yet, if economic con
ditions get better before 1932, the
Democrats can claim part credit for
the recovery because they control
one branch of Congress.
