HEARTBREAK—At the Stanford
Theatre.
Charles Farrell is very tall and
handsome in the unifom of an
American flying ace duriftg the
World War, and proves that emo
tion can be convincingly pictured
without onion tears and tearing of
hair.
Madge Evans, as the girl in the
case, is exceedingly beautiful, and
succeeds in this, her comeback to
the screen, although some of her
outbursts are too forced.
The plot is rather hackneyed—the
hero unwittingly killing the girl's
brother and getting himself very in
volved, with violent remorse. On
the whole it's not a bad war picture.

MAYTIME—At the Geary Theatre,

San Francisco.
Romberg's melodies presented by
the San Francisco Light Opera Com
pany, with Audrey Farncroft and
Fred Scott playing the leads.
The story begins in 1840, a time
when ladies married to please their

I fathers, not their hearts, and lasts
! through four generations of the Van
Zandt family, or at least long enough
for Roland Woodruff, playing the
part of Matthew Van Zandt, to take
1 unto himself four wives. Woodruff
is the pet of the audience—"the
pink-eyed snoozer." —E.E.H.
SOB SISTER—At the Varsity Thea

[ See it. You won't be sorry. Every
' minute is packed with convincing
action. Linda Watkins and James
Dunn make a sweet pair of rival
reporters, insulting one another,
: scooping one another, and loving
one another.
There's love, human interest, mur
der, and the good old journalistic
! dash and tear —all this backed by
i real photography which fools you
I completely.
I defy you to sit through "Sob
i Sister" and not lose yourself en
