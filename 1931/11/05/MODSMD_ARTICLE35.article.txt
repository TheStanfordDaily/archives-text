IMPASSE
| The Editor, Sir:
In view of the fact that the Daily
; gained absolutely nothing last night
jin going "before the Executive
I Committee to ask for an increase of
fifteen cents," and because this is
j not the first time the executives of
the Daily hav>' met with a similar
rebuff, I feel that we should leave
| nothing undone in a supreme effort
to obtain this financial relief at this
! time. The relief will be somewhat
: permanent, while present needs
| cannot remain as acute as they are
| now. Once and for all time I believe
that the student body as a whole
should be given an opportunity to
express its approval of the Daily
as one o fthe leading student enter
prises FOR THE STUDENT. To my
j mind it is absurd for the student
I body manager to plead lack of funds
I while the original source of those
I funds lies in the students them
j selves. I believe it was decided to
j go before the Ex Committee in or-
I der to give them an opportunity to
! act first. They have refused while
| admitting the justice of an increased
! subscription rate. This is an old, old
j story. The A.S.S.U. will be forced to
i meet any deficit incurred by the pa-
I per as long as that organization pub
| iishes it. I think it was infinitely
j wrong for the manager of the paper
! to promise to "get by" in any man
! ner or means on the present sub
• seription rate. But this promise can
i work no ill against the qualify of
! the paper if two-thirds of the stu
j dent body demand a reapportion
j ment of the A.S.S.U. budget. That
Ihe A.S.S.U. can get money when
! necessity demands is a foregone
; conclusion. Personally, I feel that
the trouble lies in a different quar
j ler. I do not think the attitude to
! ward the Daily as shown by Bob
Brown and A1 Denny is a true re
j flection of the attitude of the student
j body as a whole. While the iron is
| still hot it would be fairly easy to
! obtain two thousand names of stu
| dents who will vote for reapportion
[ ment of the student body fund in
1 favor of the Stanford Daily. This
; change to be put into affect with
| the beginning of the Winter Quarter
(when this additional money will
j beosrely needed). —Ray E. Clark.
