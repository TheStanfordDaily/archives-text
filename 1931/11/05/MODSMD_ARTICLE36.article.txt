"Our Kollege Kut Kords are fit
to wear to Sunday services. And if
you'd wear our Kollege Kut Klothes
to church you would be the center
of attraction." —Adv. in college
comic.

But don't you think that's being
too much a krafty Kristian?

We have often thought that if the
j 500 would pay as much attention to
studies as they do to achieving the
! downward droop to their cigarettes
they would all be Phi Betes. The
j perfect forty-five-degree-tilt-down
: and - three - points - to - port effect
j shows great skill, but must be rather
i disconcerting to the old ladies who
; come to visit the chapel and Hoo
| ver's home.
And what a swell mass satire the
| rooting section could produce if ihey
! would all pull down the brim of
i their rooter's hat to a point in the
i front, tip them to one side, and so
achieve a perfect Eugenie hat.
Headline in country paper:
