DOWN AT Southern California they
* have a quaint old custom wreck
ing the Big Red Machine each au
tumn. They have done it for three
years straight now, and have not
been run over by that vehicle since
1926.
If the Trojan is to be unhorsed
this yeat and the said quaint old
custom given a setback, much of
the credit will be due the Stanford
line. While it is difficult to attribute
that massacre of last year to any
one factor, there are those who
blame the Indian forward wall more
than anything else.
This year Pop Warner and his
diminutive assistant, Tiny Thorn
hill, have welded a line that those
Terrible Trojans will have a hard
time pushing around. And if that
line can stop the U.S.C. offense long
enough to give the Stanford attack
a chance to swing into action, it may
he the Cardinal rooting section
which serpentines late Saturday af
ternoon.
Remember that even lust year
the Indians collected 111 points.
That was enough to beat the
Trojans in l!) 26, enough to tie
them in IJJ27, and would have
beaten them in IU2X and
There is reason to believe that
Moffatt, Caddel, Hillman, Allen (to
Colvin) and company can collect 13
points this year. If' the line func
tions, that should be 'enough to win.
THE ENDS offer little cause for
worry—Colvin and Tod have come
through in surprising fashion this
season, and they are backed up by
Neill and Doub, last year's regulars,
Who still know what the game is
about.
Extremely important arc the
tackles, with Mr. Ehrhorn, Mr.
If and. and Mr. Grey hearing
much of the responsibility for
stopping the Howard Jones at
tack. The huge Ehrhorn has the
potentialities of being one of the
best tackles on the coast —if he
(ires up Saturday tie can malic
plenty of trouble for Troy. Iland
is a fighter, and will probably
get the call over Grey, who has
been handicapped by a knee in
jury.
The center trio, Corbus, Bigelow,
and Milligan, is a question. The
three have shown signs this season
of greater things to come, but are
untried in the strain of major com
petition. If they come through Sat
urday, as they are capable of com
ing through, look out Trojans!
It took Russell Newland, coast
sports editor of the Associated
Press, to figure this one out. A
columnist on the Watsonville
Register, for which this scriviner
used to scriven, uses the nom
dc plume, "Zifnig." Newland
finally read it backwards.
MINNESOTA will face a strong
"Warner" team for the second time
this year when they clash with
Northwestern Saturday in .a game
which may decide the issue in ihe
Big Ten.
Dick Hanley's Wildcats use
the Warner system, which
proved baffling to the Gophers
in (heir recent invasion of the
Farm. Northwestern is at a peak
for the game and is favored to
win, but so were lowa and Wis
consin, for that matter.
The Gophers have proved to be
the big surprise of the Middle West
this season, and have dropped but
one game, the one to Stanford.

The center trio, Corbus, Bigelow,
and Milligan, is a question. The
three have shown signs this season
of greater things to come, but are
untried in the strain of major com
petition. If they come through Sat
urday, as they are capable of com
ing through, look out Trojans!

sports editor of the Associated

MINNESOTA will face a strong
"Warner" team for the second time
this year when they clash with
Northwestern Saturday in .a game
which may decide the issue in ihe
Big Ten.
Dick Hanley's Wildcats use
the Warner system, which
proved baffling to the Gophers
in (heir recent invasion of the
Farm. Northwestern is at a peak
for the game and is favored to
win, but so were lowa and Wis

The Gophers have proved to be
the big surprise of the Middle West
this season, and have dropped but
one game, the one to Stanford.

DOWN AT Southern California they
* have a quaint old custom wreck
ing the Big Red Machine each au
tumn. They have done it for three
years straight now, and have not
been run over by that vehicle since
1926.
If the Trojan is to be unhorsed
this yeat and the said quaint old
custom given a setback, much of
the credit will be due the Stanford
line. While it is difficult to attribute
that massacre of last year to any
one factor, there are those who
blame the Indian forward wall more
than anything else.
This year Pop Warner and his
diminutive assistant, Tiny Thorn
hill, have welded a line that those
Terrible Trojans will have a hard
time pushing around. And if that
line can stop the U.S.C. offense long
enough to give the Stanford attack
a chance to swing into action, it may
he the Cardinal rooting section
which serpentines late Saturday af
ternoon.
Remember that even lust year
the Indians collected 111 points.
That was enough to beat the
Trojans in l!) 26, enough to tie
them in IJJ27, and would have
beaten them in IU2X and
There is reason to believe that
Moffatt, Caddel, Hillman, Allen (to
Colvin) and company can collect 13
points this year. If' the line func
tions, that should be 'enough to win.
THE ENDS offer little cause for
worry—Colvin and Tod have come
through in surprising fashion this
season, and they are backed up by
Neill and Doub, last year's regulars,
Who still know what the game is
about.
Extremely important arc the
tackles, with Mr. Ehrhorn, Mr.
If and. and Mr. Grey hearing
much of the responsibility for
stopping the Howard Jones at
tack. The huge Ehrhorn has the
potentialities of being one of the
best tackles on the coast —if he
(ires up Saturday tie can malic
plenty of trouble for Troy. Iland
is a fighter, and will probably
