# Frosh Football Men Perfect Offensive
## SEAVER, MOORE IN BACKFIELD MAKE TEAM EFFECTIVE California Reserve Power Might Mean Trouble For Yearlings 
### Francis Hamilton 
Under the glare of floodlights on
the varsity field, the Stanford fresh
men labored long into the darkness
last night. Whereas Wednesday's
practice was distinctly defensive in
nature, the yearlings spent yester
day in perfecting their offensive
plays in a dummy scrimmage.
The combination of Seaver and
Moore at quarter and fullback is
an apparent fixture. The two are
the most powerful driving backs 011
the squad and are a dangerous pair
on line plays. One disadvantage of
the move is the loss of Moore as a
threat on reverses. He was a par
ticularly effective ground-gainer 01)
this type of play.
Flanagan Returns
Flanagan, who was injured in the
Trobabe contest, has returned to
practice this week and is working
with Herringer in a second quarter
and fullback unit. The latter man
is a huskily built back who has not
had much opportunity to show what
he could do in a game, although
he appeared in Saturday's clash
with Moran and punched over one
of the Cardinal touchdowns.
There is a quiet undercurrent of
optimism among followers of the
babe team on the Farm which ex
presses the feeling that Saturday's
meeting with the Golden Bear Cubs
will not be as one-sided as the
dope reads. While California's ad
vantage is only on paper, after all
it is hard to discount its brilliant
lecord.
Card Subs Weak
Admitting for the sake of argu
ment that Stanford's first team is
the equal of the Blue and Gold
babes, the Cardinal reserve power
is simply not there. The Bears
could insert a fresh team into the
fray at every quarter, and have no
appreciable decrease in playing abil
ity of the line-up at the end of the
game. Forty or fifty men playing
at top speed during a short space
of time could maintain a matchless
pace. Of course, there always re
mains the possibility that the Car
dinals will rise to the •heights and
out-fight their opponents, and sole
ly on that possibility are Stanford
backers refusing to sell freshman
stock short.
