# FIRST TEAM SOCCER PLAYERS SHOW OLD FORM IN PRACTICE
## 
### 
Snapping out of their two-day
slump, the varsity soccer team yes
terday ran rough-shod over the
second team, 4-1.
Art Hearn garnered two of the
markers, while Knecht and Cap
tain Falk scored one apiece. The
fact that the two teams had traded
fullbacks and goalies may have
contributed something to the re
versal of form, but the forward
line showed a lot more of the spark
that defeated California last Sat
urday than they displayed during
the preceding two days.
The work of the varsity fullbacks,
Holmes and Brekelbaum, saved the j
second team from further mauling, i
ns well as keeping clown the score j
that they were able to run up [
against the varsity.
Once- again Cyril Johnson, bril â€” j
liant center-forward, saved the sub- :
stitutes from a whitewashing, when |
he banged a difficult center-up be- ,
tween the posts.
Coach Eberhart had his freshmen '
hard at work against the third var
sity, following intensive drill on the 1
passing of the forwards.
Inability to score has â–  cost the '
yearlings most of their games so j
far, and Coach Eberhart is experi- ;
menting with various combinations |
of the forwards in an attempt to j
discover one that can ring up the ,
scores.
At present his best bet seems to j
be Weaver at inside-left, Rojas at j
center - forward, and Emerick at >
right - inside, the same trio that
started against the Bear Cubs last j
Saturdav.
