# DINK PLEASED BY SHOWING OF STARS AT WEEKLY MEET
## Johns, Eastman, Morentin, And Lyman Threaten To Set Records 
### Dick Strouse 
Full distances were run for the
i second time this year in yester
day's presentation of that famous
Stanford drama: The Weekly Track
| Meet. And again the performance
! was a mixture of the good and the
j bad. Stars of this week's show were
i Ned Johns, John Lyman, Phil Mo
! rentin, and the perennial Ben East-
J man, but the production was
1 marred by the inability of such
I first-rate performers as the Ilablcs
| brothers, Lombardi, Stallings, Ae-
I bersold, and Werder to participate.
Johns's contribution to the day's
i performance was a vault of 13 feet
I to tie with Bill Miller of Menlo J.C.
| for first place in the pole-vault. The
i other outstanding event in the
| "field" part of the track and field
J meet was Lyman's prodigious heave
iof 48 feet in the shot put. John
! proved his versatility yesterday by
also winning the discus on his first
attempt at throwing plates this year.
Dink Likes Morentin
i Dink Templeton, who, by the way,
: is coach of the Stanford team and
; not only a newspaper reporter, was
j particularly pleased by Phil Moren
i tin's victory in the two-mile. Phii
j was forced to run 10:26.4 and to
. beat Art Azevcdo in order to win
this race, and he did both in a style
I that promises much, flank Coe, who
1 holds the Big Meet record in the
i two-mile, actually broke the tape
j in yesterday's race, but the employ
ment of higher mathematics by the
j horde of officials and managers
I present revealed that Hank had
only run seven laps.
Determining to be generous, Ben
I Eastman decided to run only one
! race in near record time yesterday,
i and so contented himself with a
, :21.8 220. Incidentally, we might
[ mention that he also won the 100
j in 10.1, but this is comparatively
slow time for Ben. Eastman did
not participate in the 440, which
| gave Dan Murphy a chance to show
1 that he is earnest about obtaining
i that fourth place on the relay team.
Dan was clocked in :52.4, and won
1 pulling away.
Ray Good
A1 Ray demonstrated that he will
i probably be one of the best javelin-
I throwers on the coast this year
| when he hurled the spear 184 feet
; through the air. Dunn and Brown
i were second and third. The high
jump again divulged nothing start
! ling, and was won by Keeble at 5
feet 8 inches. Since U.S.C. is re
ported to boast three Sophomores
j who all cleared (5 feet 6 inches last
; year (no foolin'), it can be seen
1 that high-jumping at Stanford is
i figuratively as well as literally up
j in the air.
