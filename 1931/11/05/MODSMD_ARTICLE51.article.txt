# UNDEFEATED JUNIOR A TEAM WILL MEET B'S IN CLASS BASKETBALL
## 
### 
Civil war will rage in earnest to
night when the undefeated Junior
A quintet, favored with the Sopho
more A s to fight it out for the in
terclass basketball championship,
takes on a twice-beaten Junior B
outfit.
The Junior A attack is built
around the two Card flashes, Tom
Cordry and Reggie Meade, while
the B's present Chuck Glasgow as
their outstanding casaba sinker.
A fast-developing freshman five
encounters a strong quintet when
they meet the Sophomore A's. With
Jenkins to consistently capture the
tip-off honors, and Topping dropping
them from all angles, the second
year men have a combination that is
hard to break up.
The yearling squad is pretty much
of an unknown quantity, but to
date they have shown steady im
provement, and with the advent of
a few football men after Saturday's
California struggle, may have a real
championship crew by the lime
they meet the Junior A's next
Thursday.
The third contest of the evening
will find the Seniors and Sophomore
B's fighting to stay out of the cellar
in the league standings.
The seniors have three consistent
point-scorers in Hepp, Griffin, and

[ Martin, and because of their close
buttle with the strong Junior A's
last Thursday, are favored to tuke
1 the B's into- camp.
Although the sophomore outfit lost
to the freshman quintet by a large
I margin in their first game, they have
shown flashes of good form. Backed
; up with a lot of fight, they are a
threat all the time, and may find
themselves against the seniors.
