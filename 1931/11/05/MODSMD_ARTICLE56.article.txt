# LOS ANGELES PIPELINE DYNAMITED

### 

Grapevine siphon of the Owens Valley aqueduct was damaged by
a blast of dynamite near the Jawboni canyon on the desert near
Mojave. Los Angeles city officials thought it was a renewal of war
fare between the city and Owens Valley ranchers accused of blasting
the pipeline nine times within the last five years.
