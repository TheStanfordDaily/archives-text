# DELTA CHIS, BETAS, PHI KAPS WIN AT TOUCH FOOTBALL; CUADRO SLAUGHTERED
## 
### 
Scoring three touchdowns in each
half, and converting half of them,
the Thcta Chi touch-football team
ran up a new scoring record for
the season when they swamped El
Cuadro 39-0 yesterday afternoon.
Dick Henderson scored two of
the touchdowns with a long run
back of a punt and a cut through
left tackle. George Griffin tallied
two more on long passes from Roily
Howe.
Two of the conversions were on
passes from Roily Howe to Hinton
Howe, and the other from Howe to
Les Roos.
The fifth touchdown came as the
result of a beautiful toss, good for
40 yards, by the Howe combination
again, Roily to Hinton.
With only two minutes to play,
and El Cuadro making its first de
termined bid for a score, Churchill,
playing safety for the Row-men,
pulled down a Club pass and raced

1 75 yards down the side-lines to
make it 39-0.
Suffering from the same malady
that used to affect Stanford baseball
| varsities, too much Hoerner, the
Delta Chis were trounced by the
Fijis, 20-0.
Hoerner to Bill Jaekle for the
first score, went through center to
: score the second himself, and kicked
j two conversions.
The third score came when John
|ny Hinchliffe intercepted a Delta
Chi pass on their 25-yard line and
trotted the remaining distance, near
; the end of the game.
Delta Chi's best bid for a score
1 was a drive that fell short on the
i Fiji 20-yard stripe.
The Betas hung up another when
they defeated El Tigre, 13-0. Ketron
i circled the ends for one score and
j the conversion, and Ski llern regis
i tered the other on a pass from Russ
White.
The Clubmen failed to penetrate
beyond the Beta 35-yard marker.
