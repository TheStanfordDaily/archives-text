# BOURBONS ROW IN BATTLE FOR VICTORY SPOILS
## Expect To Settle Disputes In Party Caucus As Harmony Hoped 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (/P). â€”
House Democrats began a brisk
skirmish today for the spoils of
victory, confident of a satisfactory
division before engaging in the con
test over organization.
The prize of floor leadership and
a number of chairmanships of im
portant committees is sought by
both Northern and Southern mem
bers. The Southern states have
ranking Democrats on 29 of the 46
committees, and with the entire
membership behind Representative
John N. Garner of Texas, will take
the Speakership, if the party is suc
cessful in the voting on organization.
Assurances that harmony will
prevail were made by several mem
bers today. The present differences
are to be composed at a Democratic
caucus December 5.
Assurances that the powerful New
York delegation of 23 would throw
its force behind Garner for Speaker
were given by Representative Dick
stein of that state. This squelched
reports of possible desertion of this
important group, in the event they
were dissatisfied with the division of
power.
Representative Hawley of Oregon,
from his home at Salem, issued a
formal notice today calling the Re
publicans into conference here No
vember 30 to select a nominee for
Speaker to succeed the late Nicholas
Longworth of Ohio. Hawley is
chairman of the Republican caucus.
The notifications were sent by Rep
resentative Clarke of New York,
secretary of the caucus.
