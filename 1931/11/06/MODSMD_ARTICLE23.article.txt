LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5 (Special
1 to the Daily).—Southern California
' will receive its second defeat this
season after a hard-fought game be
fore the largest grid crowd to
witness a football game west of
I Soldiers' Field, unless an inspired,
I and only an inspired Trojan stops
j the quick thrusts of Ihe Stanford
! Indian for the scalp of his moral
I enemy.
That is Troy's opinion of Satur-
I day's classic even though it received
I a gx - eat deal of encouragement when
j Ray Sparling, who has been laid up
I with an injured leg, made his first
| appearance in the varsity left end

i position since the Cal game. Spar
j ling's unexpected return necessi-
I tated Johnny Baker's removal to his
i old running guard position, while
Rosy Rosenberg drops back to the
second string left guard.
With Ray Sparling's injury im
proving so rapidly it is most prob
able that he will start in the battle
of centuries. In this case the start
ing lineup for the Trojans will be
the same as the one that faced the
j Bears with the exception of John
! Dye who will replace Larry Ste
j vens. The rise of Dye to the first
I wall of Troy has been one of the
j most spectacular in the history of
i Trojan linemen.
j Orv Mohler's case is hanging in
| the balance with the medical staff
j still in favor of a prescription of
j benchwarming for the Southern
California flash.
