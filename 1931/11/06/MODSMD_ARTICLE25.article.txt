# VARSITY HAS FIGHTING CHANCE TO WIN GAME TOMORROW
## Indians Sharpen Tomahawk For Trojans' Necks Warner Has Been Planning All Season Toward Win Over Southern Team; Has Kept First String Out of Play in Majority Games CARDS DEPEND ON ABILITY OF PHIL MOFFATT Stress Power Drive of Hillman in Center of Line With Tacklet Threats of Caddel and Moffatt 
### LOWELL COX Sport Editor, Stanford Daily 
The denouement comes tomorrow.
i Pop Warner's great drama, "The Mystery Team of 1931," will reach its
I climax at Los Angeles tomorrow when the Indians of Stanford meet the
| Trojans of Southern California before the largest crowd ever to see a
; football game west of Chicago.
Big Red Machine or Little Pink Go-Cart? That question, after seven
: games, will at last be answered as Pop throws his most powerful combina
! tion against the Trojans.
A season of building has gone into that Indian varsity which will invade
the Olympic Stadium tomorrow afternoon. Since the opening game of 'lie
year it has been apparent that Warner has been looking ahead to the
U.S.C. classic. Not once has the team been brought to a peak, while in

â€¢ only one game wtfs the maximum
power lineup used to any extent.
In that lone contest, with Minne
sota, Captain Harry Hillman, Mof
, fatt, Caddel, and Allen worked long
enough as a unit to demonstrate
some of the real possibilities of the
team. But since that time the Old
1 Man has been extremely careful not
; to reveal his hand, and Stanford will
I enter tomorrow's game as the mys
; tery team of the coast.
Trojans Have Power
On the other hand the Trojans
1 have clearly demonstrated they have
j a great team. St. Mary's caught them
j off balance in the opening game of
the season and California fought
| them almost to a standstill two
weeks ago, but there is no mistak
i ing the power of that Howard Jones
eleven.
| Southern California will enter the
game on the long end of 2>/2 to 1
I edds, odds which the Indians hope
to upset. Their chances of success
j depend on:
1. The ability of MofTatt to
play the greater part of the
battle.
2. The ability of the Cardinal
I forward wall to stop the tre
mendous power generated by
I the Jones attack.
3. The ability of Hillman and
Caddel to supply the needed
i punch between the tackles to
j ailow the rest of the Warner at
i tack to function as it should.
4. The ability of the team as
a whole to "lire up" as California
j did two weeks ago.
i The Indians are one team with
Moffatt, another without him. And
; when Phil leaves the game, Caddel
i goes with him to make room for
i Afflerbauph and his educated toe.
Cards Have Chance
# Despite the odds, Stanford has a
| fighting chance to score an upset to
; morrow. Grounds are lacking for
' predicting a victory, but it is cer
| tain that the Indians will provide
j El Trojan with a large afternoon.
The squad will leave for the
Southland tonight CONFIDENT of
victory. Warner, usually so pessi
mistic, says, "We'll give them a good
i game."
And Pop has just enough up his
| famous sleeve so that if it is hu
manly possible for the 1931 varsily
to break that string of U.S.C. vic
j tories they will do it.
