When iho pajama-clad freshmen stormed Palo Alto last
night, they were met l>v a gracious theater manager in
stead of (he usual blustering policemen and threatening
ushers.
I bis manager allowed the frosh to attend the movie
wiihout paying admission, thus avoiding the stampede into
the showhouse that accompanied the Pajamarino of for
mer years, with the attending injuries and anoyance to the
cash customers.
A wise move, Mr. Manager, thanks.
