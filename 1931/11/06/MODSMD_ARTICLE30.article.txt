# A 						50-50 PROPOSITION
## 
### 
In one of Hit* California universities, students are doing
their "dating" on a fiO-fiO plan. Whenever a couple attends
a dance, or a show, or goes to dinner, they divide the ex
pense, the girl standing her share. As yet we do not know
liie exact results of this interesting experiment, hut ii is
well to consider the points for and against it.
The custom of having a man pay all costs of entertain
ment is nothing more or less than a hold-over from the
days of chivalry when women were helpless and sat at
home doing embroidery work while their knights went out
to protect them. Those days are far, far removed from this
age of the girl capable of supporting herself. This inde
pendent woman is usually able to pay her own way wher
ever she goes and if she does it might be a great help to
the average college man.
On the other hand, what etTect would such a 50-50
agreement have on the attitude of college men and women
toward each other? Much of the element of romance
binges upon woman's dependence on man. When abso
lutely no shadow of that independence is left, will the col
lege man have lost his sense of superiority, and the college
woman her respect for him? Will Hetty Co-ed feel much
of a heart-throb for Joe College jis she pays his way to
the movies? Hardly the "clinging vine" strain in femi
nine nature cannot be denied.
The problem is how to be economically sensible and
still not murder in cold blood the lingering ghost of Ro
mance. Washington. Slalr Ewrtjrccn
