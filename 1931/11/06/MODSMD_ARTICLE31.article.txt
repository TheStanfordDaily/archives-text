# BULL SESSION
## POOR CAL! 
### 
Two years ago when 21 Stanford
men clicked the camera that was
heard all over the bay region, and
brought back the "Axe" from, the
American Trust Company (Berkeley
Branch) to the American Trust
Company (Palo Alto Branch) there
was much excitement on the two
campuses. Naturally, the Farm was
somewhat elated on getting some
thing from Berkeley; but no one
seriously considered that Berkeley's
holding the axe had been something
terrible. No one hated Berkeley for
being able to keep Stanford's "battle
symbol"; in fact she was admired
after a fashion in being able to
keep it.
However, when the axe was stolen
from Berkeley or returned to Stan
ford, depending on the point of
view, the editor of the Daily Cali
fornian perched himself behind a
typewriter and dashed off an edi
torial that he thought surely would
fire up the campus. The theme song
was "Hate Stanford"; there was no
particular reason for this feeling ex
cept that several pounds of steel
on a stick had been very cleverly
taken from its foster parents and
returned to the place of origin.
At the time, common opinion was
that the editor must have stood too
close to the bonfire and that the ex
cessive heat had remained with him
when he sat down to his editorial
writing. Others were of the opinion,
however, that some College Come
dies productions or some College
Humor stories had temporarily swept

[ over the man in such a way that he
j became imbued with the desire to
j become the college hero—coin the
phrase that was to live for posterity
j —and place himself in the same
class with the quarterback who
could score the winning touchdown
| by recovering a Stanford fumble on
his own goal line and race the
; length of the field to victory, fame,
! and adoration from the Campus
| Queen.
The surprise of Stanford at that
| phrase at that time has been just
; equaled if not surpassed by the
statement that California is plan
\ ning to perpetuate that ridiculous
; slogan, "Hate Stanford." Of course,
j whether Cal hates this University
I or not is of little actual importance
j to Stanford. But that a cosmopolitan
institution like Berkeley should
stoop to practices common only to
1 the movies and to small provin
i cially minded colleges, reflects seri
-1 ously on Stanford's rival. Rivalry
has always existed between the tv/o
schools and various smoker-room
i ballads have had wide circulation
; respecting the merits of the two
student bodies; but California is .the
i school that is trying to start some
j thing that cannot be reciprocated at
| this end. California may "Hate Stan
; ford"; but Stanford can only say,
| "Poor Cal"—not because of her
! football defeats, but because of her
i desire to sing a "Hymn of Hate"—
| which is not only contrary to sports
manship but ludicrous in the ex-
I treme. —Abe MellinkofT

Two years ago when 21 Stanford
men clicked the camera that was
heard all over the bay region, and
brought back the "Axe" from, the
American Trust Company (Berkeley
Branch) to the American Trust
Company (Palo Alto Branch) there
was much excitement on the two
campuses. Naturally, the Farm was
somewhat elated on getting some
thing from Berkeley; but no one
seriously considered that Berkeley's
holding the axe had been something
terrible. No one hated Berkeley for
being able to keep Stanford's "battle
symbol"; in fact she was admired
after a fashion in being able to
keep it.
However, when the axe was stolen
from Berkeley or returned to Stan
ford, depending on the point of
view, the editor of the Daily Cali
fornian perched himself behind a
typewriter and dashed off an edi
torial that he thought surely would
fire up the campus. The theme song
was "Hate Stanford"; there was no
particular reason for this feeling ex
cept that several pounds of steel
on a stick had been very cleverly
taken from its foster parents and
returned to the place of origin.
At the time, common opinion was
that the editor must have stood too
close to the bonfire and that the ex
cessive heat had remained with him
when he sat down to his editorial
writing. Others were of the opinion,
however, that some College Come
dies productions or some College
Humor stories had temporarily swept

[ over the man in such a way that he
j became imbued with the desire to
j become the college hero—coin the
phrase that was to live for posterity
j —and place himself in the same
class with the quarterback who
could score the winning touchdown
| by recovering a Stanford fumble on
his own goal line and race the
; length of the field to victory, fame,
! and adoration from the Campus
| Queen.
The surprise of Stanford at that
| phrase at that time has been just
; equaled if not surpassed by the
statement that California is plan
\ ning to perpetuate that ridiculous
; slogan, "Hate Stanford." Of course,
j whether Cal hates this University
I or not is of little actual importance
j to Stanford. But that a cosmopolitan
institution like Berkeley should
stoop to practices common only to
1 the movies and to small provin
i cially minded colleges, reflects seri
-1 ously on Stanford's rival. Rivalry
has always existed between the tv/o
schools and various smoker-room
i ballads have had wide circulation
; respecting the merits of the two
student bodies; but California is .the
i school that is trying to start some
j thing that cannot be reciprocated at
| this end. California may "Hate Stan
; ford"; but Stanford can only say,
| "Poor Cal"—not because of her
! football defeats, but because of her
i desire to sing a "Hymn of Hate"—
| which is not only contrary to sports
