SUSAN SPRAY—By Sheila Kaye- j
Smith. Harper & Brothers. 11)31. 1
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
"Susan Spray" is a veritable "Pit- 1
grim's Progress." It is, if possible, j
longer and more torturous than
Bunyon's classic.
In the last century, a young girl j
in the large family of an English I
farm laborer is a religious fanatic.
The family is poverty stricken and '
finally all the members of it are re
duced to the poorhouse. After a
time Susan is "hired out" as a ser
vant girl.
Susan Spray works her way up
from obscurity as a preacher. De
signs and schemes bring her at last
to her goal—gorgeous vestments and j
her own pulpit. She is comparable to j
Christian in "Pilgrim's Progress" in '
everything but the means she uses j
to reach her "salvation": she is j
really a hypocrite.
One thing may be said in favor
of the book—the original conception
of the achieving of significance by j
an ignorant girl is good material for j
a novel and a long one. But it must j
be done in an interesting or at least ;
an instructive way. Sheila Kaye-
Smith uses enough quotations from i
S.usan's sermons alone to make the j
book laborious reading. She is an
author who has in nearly all her
books several rather good ideas lost
in a wad of padding. —E.T.P.

GUYS AND DOLLS—By Damon
Runyon. Frederick A. Stokes. New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
A collection of amusingly idiotic
and unperlurbingly aimless tales
whose familiar airs are so enter
tainingly rehummed by the M. Run
yon that they remain readable.
Runyon's style—he writes in the
first person and drags his tenses,

however aged, all to the present—is
odd and somewhat awkward. At first
it is partially unintelligible, then
amusing, and finally rather tiresome.
The tales are about as sane as the
wanderings of a P. G. Wodehouse
hero among the smells of Soho. But
Runyon substitutes guns for the
Englishman's inevitable flower-pots
which change, if welcome, is some
what messier.
The book is suggested for casual,
easy reading. —J.S.S.

MEXICO, A STUDY OF TWO
AMERICAS —By Stuart Chase.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
With a brilliance and sureness that
pales anything that he has yet at
tempted, Stuart Chase, with con
, vincing sincereness, distills the
! glamour, the personality, and thqp
history that is Mexico. He handles
the whole subject with a clever
familiar tone. The Mexican inertia
has captured his imagination, and
1 he finds a lesson in it for the United
' States.
Fascinatingly rich in detail—of
; Inca religion, and economics — of
: Mexico today with its revolutions
! and quiet beauty—clearly written in
; Chase's best style, "Mexico" ranks
1 as one of the best books of the sea
' son.
It is more than a mere economic
! history; it is the "portrait of a brown
i philosopher astride a volcano.."

MEXICO, A STUDY OF TWO
AMERICAS —By Stuart Chase.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
With a brilliance and sureness that
pales anything that he has yet at
tempted, Stuart Chase, with con
, vincing sincereness, distills the
! glamour, the personality, and thqp
history that is Mexico. He handles
the whole subject with a clever
familiar tone. The Mexican inertia
has captured his imagination, and
1 he finds a lesson in it for the United
' States.
Fascinatingly rich in detail—of
; Inca religion, and economics — of
: Mexico today with its revolutions
! and quiet beauty—clearly written in
; Chase's best style, "Mexico" ranks
1 as one of the best books of the sea
' son.
It is more than a mere economic
! history; it is the "portrait of a brown
i philosopher astride a volcano.."

SUSAN SPRAY—By Sheila Kaye- j
Smith. Harper & Brothers. 11)31. 1
(At the Stanford Bookstore.)
"Susan Spray" is a veritable "Pit- 1
grim's Progress." It is, if possible, j
longer and more torturous than
Bunyon's classic.
In the last century, a young girl j
in the large family of an English I
farm laborer is a religious fanatic.
The family is poverty stricken and '
finally all the members of it are re
duced to the poorhouse. After a
time Susan is "hired out" as a ser
vant girl.
Susan Spray works her way up
from obscurity as a preacher. De
signs and schemes bring her at last
to her goal—gorgeous vestments and j
her own pulpit. She is comparable to j
Christian in "Pilgrim's Progress" in '
everything but the means she uses j
to reach her "salvation": she is j
really a hypocrite.
One thing may be said in favor
of the book—the original conception
of the achieving of significance by j
an ignorant girl is good material for j
a novel and a long one. But it must j
be done in an interesting or at least ;
an instructive way. Sheila Kaye-
Smith uses enough quotations from i
S.usan's sermons alone to make the j
book laborious reading. She is an
author who has in nearly all her
books several rather good ideas lost
in a wad of padding. —E.T.P.

GUYS AND DOLLS—By Damon
Runyon. Frederick A. Stokes. New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
A collection of amusingly idiotic
and unperlurbingly aimless tales
whose familiar airs are so enter
tainingly rehummed by the M. Run
yon that they remain readable.
Runyon's style—he writes in the
first person and drags his tenses,

however aged, all to the present—is
odd and somewhat awkward. At first
it is partially unintelligible, then
amusing, and finally rather tiresome.
The tales are about as sane as the
wanderings of a P. G. Wodehouse
hero among the smells of Soho. But
Runyon substitutes guns for the
Englishman's inevitable flower-pots
which change, if welcome, is some
what messier.
