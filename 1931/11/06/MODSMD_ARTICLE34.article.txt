# The 						Windjammer

What with seven-eighths of
this otherwise staid student
body turning collegiate and
leaving ai any and all times and
in any or all disapproved man
ners for the sunny southland, |
there's not much use in having
a colyum at a!l today. Except
to cheer up the unhappy stay
at-homes— and being one of
those ourself we're sort of rusty
from tears.
It's a real problem for considera- i
tion, this question of getting down j
to the game—what with the possi- j
bility ol stowing away on the boat, j
or hiding under somebody's over
coat and —uh — thermos bottle of
drinking water in a rumble seat. Oh, !
well . . .
At best, nothing in (his man's
town is consistent. Stopped in j
at Thurlow's, last night. Much
smoke rings, raucous laughter
and cursings at a card game, at
one of the tables—and the ra
dio cooing "My Rosary," over in
the corner. College life! Maybe
the worshipful creatures on the
new gates mean something after
all.
We read in the California Daily as 1
how the KA's up there are veritable I
| song-birds, and win vocal contests '
and everything. Maybe that's re
sponsible for a lot of things half
way up our Row. You and the rest
of the sopranos, boys!
Contribution to our "Bright
Sayings of Bright Children"
section: Little Jimmy, aged l!) :t j
yrs., says that Esau was a guy
who wrote fables and sold his
copyright for a mess of potash.

Waxing sentimental under the i
strain of wondering about the Tro
jan Wonders, Windjammer (to be 1
carefully distinguished from pa- ;
jammer) waxes lyrical to the tune !
of "How Many Times." Sing this
to your bunk-mate while holding
his head for him tomorrow night:
How many times will they say
"8-6-2"?
How many times will they
smash our line through?

How many halfbacks will stum
ble and fall?
How many times will they
fumble the ball?
How many times will Pop send
in a sub?
How many score - plays have
we? (there's the rub!)
I'd make a bet that it's not too
many
But Trojans are cocky, think we
haven't got any.
Please tell me how many times?

Cheerio, pals—and a happy land
ing!
