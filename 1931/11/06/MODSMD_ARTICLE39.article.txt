# VOCATION SERVICE GUIDES STUDENT'S LIFE WORK CHOICE
## Vocational Tests Have Been Devised For Women By Grace Manson 
### Paul Zulch 
By taking advantage of the voca
tional guidance service offered by
Gilbert Wrenn, of the vocational
guidance committee, Stanford stu
dents need not face the bewildering
plight of thousands of college grad
uates who do not know what their
life work is to be.
The vocational guidance service of
Stanford University depends on
tests of students' interests in vari
ous vocational fields. Every year
Mr. Wrenn has been able to aid
hundreds of students in selecting
a suitable life work.
Tests for Women
A new test of the vocational in
terests of women, devised by Dr.
Grace P. Manson of the University
of Michigan, is now being used at
Stanford. The aim of this test is to
find the interests of college women
which coincide with interests of 13,-
000 women members of Business
and Professional Women's Clubs of
America, divided into ten vocation
al groups. By classifying these in
terests, congenial vocations may be
found.
First used last spring, the Bern
reuter Personality Schedule, devised
at Stanford, seeks to evaluate three
or four basic personality traits of
those taking this test. This schedule
is proving successful for both men
and women.
Strong's Tests
The old standby of vocational
guidance tests is the one originated
by Dr. E. K. Stronger of the Stan
ford department of psychology and
the Graduate School of Business.
This test of men's vocational inter
ests has been used extensively all
over the United States. By its use,
students' adaptability to each of 25
different vocations is found.
Mr. Wrenn, director of the Stan
ford vocational guidance service,
during his office hours in the Ad
ministration Building, welcomes the
problems of students. Personal in
terpretation is applied to the results
of all tests given. A nominal fee is
charged for this service.
