# DEPUTIES GUARD MAMMOTH PYRE FOR S.C. RALLY
## 
### 
According to wire dispatches,
students at the University of
Southern California yesterday
obtained 25 deputy sheriffs to
guard their mammoth football
rally woodpile.
Fear that rival university
students would set fire to the
pyre caused them to take every
possible precaution to insure
its readiness for the Stanford
rally tonight, prior to the Stan
ford-U.S.C. football game to
morrow.
