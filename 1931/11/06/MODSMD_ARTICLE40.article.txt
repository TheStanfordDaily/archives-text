# ALLEN WILL REPEAT THURSDAY PROGRAM AT SUNDAY RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will use the compositions
which he played at his organ recital
yesterday as a basis for his Sunday
afternoon performance at 4 o'clock.
One of the interesting pieces will
be "Fantasie in D Flat, Opus 101"
by Saint-Saens. From the outset
Saint-Saens' position among French
composers was unique. His great
est merit lies in the l'ecognition
which he caused to be given to the
modern French school of symphony.
The program will be:
Fantasie in D Flat, Opus 101
Saint-Saens
Trumpet Tune and Air Purcell
Toccata for the Elevation
Frescobaldi
The Walk to Jerusalem
Bach-Griswold
Largo from the Cello Sonata Chopin
Cortege, from the "Petite Suite"
Debussy
