# WHO SAID DEPRESSION? Frosh Demolish Vittles DAIRY MARKET STEADY

Amid a clatter of crockery and
shouts for "seconds," some 450 men
at Encina Commons during the
month of October came close to es
tablishing a record in food con
sumption.
Glimpses at the notebook of Mrs.
Brandon Watson, director of Encina
Commons, show specifically where
the dinei's made their attack.
Fatalities hit hardest in the dairy
products group. Exactly 18,360 eggs
will never be chickens, and 733
fowl will never again lay eggs. If
the eggs were laid for a second
time —end to end—they would reach
from the kitchen door of Encina to
Sequoia's front stoop, with allow
ance made for a decorative twist on
the Quad.
It took a herd of 110 cows, pro
ducing at the rate of a gallon a day,
to supply the 12,120 quarts of milk
used in October. Nor does this give
the hard-working cow credit for
1800 pounds of butter, 600 quarts of
cream, and 445 pounds of cheese
that were served.
Four hundred and thirty-two
quarts of salad oil prove that the
Commons likes its salad well lubri
cated. Each Encina man eats a half
pound of meat daily, totaling 7,592
pounds of beef, veal and lamb dur
ing the four weeks of October. Ice
cream —in 3,030 one-gallon cans —
enlivened the autumn desserts.
