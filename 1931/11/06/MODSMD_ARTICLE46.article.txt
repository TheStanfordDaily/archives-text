# CARD DEBATE TEAM TO OPPOSE TURKISH STUDENTS TUESDAY
## Pro And Con Of Bolshevism Will Be Presented In Assembly Hall 
### Bv Jack Cooper 
As the most "international" of the
long line of international debates in
which Stanford has been a partici
pant throughout the past few years,
the forensic duel between two mem
bers of Robert College in Constanti
nople, Turkey, and a pair of Stan
ford men will take the fore Tues
day evening at 8 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall.
Is the ideal of bolshevism a wor
thy one, or are its aims and pur
poses derogatory to the best inter
ests of those institutions which we
in America and the western world
hold most sacred and inviolable?
Does bolshevism's boisterous ad
vocacy of atheism herald the com
ing of a new age when religion will
no longer play a part in the mould
ing of character and civilized so
ciety?
Does the submergence of the fam
ily, the scorn for sanctity of mar
riage laws, the annihilation of in
dividualism, and the abject worship
of materialism, spell the doom for
western civilization, or is this the
beacon light pointing toward a true
civilization?
These and similar questions will
form the subject for the basis of
controversy. A. Galib Rifat and
Suha Zeki, of Robert College, will
defend the affirmative of the ques
tion and Howard Conn and Leo
nard Bloom will strive to prove the
negative of the issue for Stanford.
Despite the apparent seriousness of
the proposition, elements of humor
are not lacking, and will undoubt
edly appear to make the evening
entertaining as well as satisfactorily
enlightening, according to John
Gange, Stanford debate manager.
Fifty cents admission will be
charged to all others than Stanford
students, who may attend on their
student body cards.
