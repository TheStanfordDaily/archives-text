# Dopesters Promise Card Frosh 'One Terrific Beating'
## BEARS GIVEN EDGE BECAUSE INDIANS 'JUST WON'T FIGHT' Team Is As Good As Cubs But Lacks Push To Triumph 
### I>v Francis Hamilton 
Tomorrow an over-rated Blue and
Gold freshman football squad, ac- j
companied by the entire California '
freshman class, journeys to the j
Farm to clash with the Indian babes I
at 2 o'clock in the Stadium.
According to the dope, the Little !
Red team is fated to take the worst j
drubbing ever received by a Stan- ;
ford freshman team from their |
Berkeley rivals. According to the
dope the Bear Cubs will smash the ;
Stanford ends like so many scared |
rabbits, and with their passing at- j
tack they will make the Stanford j
back field look like crude beginners, j
The dope is true dope and it reads j
the way it does because of a reason.
The reason is not better California j
material. The Bears may have more, j
but it is not better material. The |
reason is not better coaching. Jimmy j
Bradshaw and Walt Heinecke are j
Stanford arguments against that!
reason.
The reason is that California play- j
ers are fighters in every sense of the J
word. They've got the punch, j
They've got football IT. They don't j
box tackles; they sock 'em down. :
They don't clip ends; they sock 'em
down. Their backs don't carry the
ball into the line; they grab that
ball and sock somebody. They're
tough, these California freshmen.
Too tough for Stanford? Well, it
looks that way. These Stanford men
wear football pants, but pants do
not make the man. Too much blue
blood and not enough red blood, say j
some observers. They know their
Greek letters but they haven't yet '
learned how to seek.
There are a few fighters on this ;
Stanford freshman team. Butts and i
Flippen, for instance, are a couple j
of fighters who battled their way ■
from almost hopeless oblivion in
early season to starting positions ;
against the Blue and Gold tomor- ;
row.
They might be able to go over to
Berkeley and earn a place on the j
Cub squad. They know what it is to ,
have the cards stacked against them, !
to be down at the bottom of the pile j
Mild fight their way to the top.
They've been through the mill and
tomorrow will probably find them (
playing the only way they know j
how to play, fighting mad.
A lot of Stanford rooters who are I
unable to go south will be in the !
Stadium tomorrow, watching a good i
Stanford frosh squad take a beating |
because it will not fight. They will j
all have a silent prayer on their j
lips, hoping these boys in red pants t
will get wise and learn how to play j
football out there in that game. J
They'll be hoping that Stanford finds I
itself and shows California what a j
real fighting team looks like.
The teams will probably line up
as follows:
Cal Frosh— Stanford Frosh—
Jones LER Abrahamson
Carlton LTR Lettunich
Gardner LGR Semmelroth
Darracq C Bates |
Buccola RGL Mottram (C) 1

The dope is true dope and it reads j
the way it does because of a reason.

material. The Bears may have more, j
but it is not better material. The |

Stanford arguments against that!
reason.
The reason is that California play- j
ers are fighters in every sense of the J
word. They've got the punch, j
They've got football IT. They don't j
box tackles; they sock 'em down. :
They don't clip ends; they sock 'em
down. Their backs don't carry the
ball into the line; they grab that
ball and sock somebody. They're
tough, these California freshmen.
Too tough for Stanford? Well, it
looks that way. These Stanford men
wear football pants, but pants do
not make the man. Too much blue
blood and not enough red blood, say j
some observers. They know their
Greek letters but they haven't yet '
learned how to seek.
There are a few fighters on this ;
Stanford freshman team. Butts and i
Flippen, for instance, are a couple j
of fighters who battled their way ■
from almost hopeless oblivion in
early season to starting positions ;
against the Blue and Gold tomor- ;
row.
They might be able to go over to
Berkeley and earn a place on the j
Cub squad. They know what it is to ,
have the cards stacked against them, !
to be down at the bottom of the pile j
Mild fight their way to the top.
They've been through the mill and
tomorrow will probably find them (
playing the only way they know j
how to play, fighting mad.
A lot of Stanford rooters who are I
unable to go south will be in the !
Stadium tomorrow, watching a good i
Stanford frosh squad take a beating |
because it will not fight. They will j
all have a silent prayer on their j
lips, hoping these boys in red pants t
will get wise and learn how to play j
football out there in that game. J
They'll be hoping that Stanford finds I
itself and shows California what a j
real fighting team looks like.
The teams will probably line up
as follows:
Cal Frosh— Stanford Frosh—
Jones LER Abrahamson
Carlton LTR Lettunich
Gardner LGR Semmelroth
Darracq C Bates |
Buccola RGL Mottram (C) 1

Tomorrow an over-rated Blue and

companied by the entire California '
freshman class, journeys to the j
Farm to clash with the Indian babes I
at 2 o'clock in the Stadium.

Red team is fated to take the worst j
drubbing ever received by a Stan- ;
