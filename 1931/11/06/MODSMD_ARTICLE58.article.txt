THE FOOTBALL EYES of the
nation will be focused on the Pacific
Coast tomorrow as the"Big Four" of
the conference clash in two classics
which will make or break the teams
involved.
Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia, both undefeated in con
ference play, will draw first at
tention. A win for the Trojans
will virtually clinch the cham
pionship for (hem, while a Stan
ford victory would throw the
conference hack into a wide
open battle for the cup, with
the Indians having the best
chance to coine out on top.
WHEN STANFORD went north
two weeks ago to tangle with Wash
ington, both HAD to win. The re
sultant scoreless tie temporarily
saved the situation for both, but a
tie won't be of much use to Jimmy
Phelan at Berkeley tomorrow. The
Huskies, already defeated by Ore
gon, have to WIN to salvage the
season.
California supporters, cheered
by the great stand of the Bears
against the Trojans, are now ex
pecting a victory Saturday where
they hardly dared hope for one
earlier in the season.
The Berkeley game will eliminate
one team from the picture, will
leave the other in the struggle for
second place. In the event of a Stan
ford triumph in the South, the

i
' Berkeley victor will have a chance
at the championship itself.
WASHINGTON is at a peak and
will make trouble for those Bears.
A football team usually has only a
I couple of games in its system like
j the one the Ingram eleven put up
; against the Trojans—and the other
(if there IS another) is undoubtedly
| being saved for Stanford.
I Look for the Huskies to give Cali
| fornia a real battle tomorrow —the
! Bears may not be able to cope with
i them at a peak.

One of the pooches up at Bel- \
mont achieved the ambition of a
lifetime Wednesday night when
he captured the mechanical rab
bit which lures the dogs around
the quarter-mile circular track.
This t p ar ticular purp, realizing
the futility of chasing the elec
tric bunny around the regula
tion route, jumped the fence
and took a short cut across the
oval to nah his prey on the hack !

of sports diversion over the
week-end. The Little Big Game
in the Stadium tomorrow after
noon should be an interesting
hattle if the Indian babes will
only fire up. If that doesn't suit,
there's the fracas over at Berke
ley. Outside the field of collegi
ate sports, there's Tanforan,
opening this afternoon, the dog
races at Belmont, and a great
