the Junior A squad, were outstand

Final Gaines
The inter-class league will swing
into its closing stages next week
with the final games being sched
uled for Friday. Provided they are
both victorious in next Thursday's
games the Junior A's and Sopho
more A's will probably fight it out
for the championship.
So far the Junior five has made
the most impressive showing, win
ning all of its games by large scores.
But the Sophomores have been
steadily improving; so a close game
can be expected.
Seniors Win
In the Senior-Sophomore B game
yesterday the Seniors fought their
way out of the cellar. Eastman and
Griffin led their scoring attack while
Kuechler was high point man for
the Sophomore B's. The Sophomore
B's and the Junior B's remain tied
for last place. They meet each other
next Friday to determine the cellar
championship.
