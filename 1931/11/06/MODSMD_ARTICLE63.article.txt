# BEARS GET REAL TEST TOMORROW
## Ingram Says Huskies Have Chance To Win 
### Dick Rodda 
Bill Ingram's squad of fighting
California Bears will be given their
final real lest before the Big Game
when they meet the Washington
Huskies Saturday at the Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley.
After their excellent showing of
two weeks ago against Southern
California, the Bears are favored to
defeat their Northern rivals, but ac
cording to Ingram the Huskies may
win.
The Bear coach believes (hat his
team may suffer with an attack of
overconfidence, and he is also aware
of the fact that Jimmy Phelan's
Huskies have vastly improved since
their early season defeat at the
hands of the Oregon Webfeet. In
recent gartnes played by the Huskies
they have held Stanford to a score
less tie and trounced Whitman 77
to 0.
Cal Men Out
The California squad is just
emerging from a long siege of in
juries and will lack the services of
a first-string end, guard, and quar
terback. Louis Di√üestu, end; Bob
McArthur, guard; and Ed Kirwan,
quarterback; will be on the bench.
However, Hank Schldach, triple
threat halfback, benched because of
an injury early ihis season, may be
in the game tomorrow. It was an
nounced early this week that Schal
dach's condition is much improved
and that it is quite likely that he
will sec action against the Huskies.
Gill Big Threat
If Schaldach does not play, Rusty
Gill will be the chief California
backfiekl threat. Gill played the
best game of his life in the Trojan
game; so if he repeats such a per
formance tomorrow the Huskies
will find him pretty hard to stop.
The Husky attack is built around
Merle Hufford, flashy ball-carrier,
and Bill Marsh, south-paw passer.
llufTord has been outstanding on the
squad from Seattle for two seasons.
Following are the lineups:
California Pos. Washington
Stone LER Nisbet
