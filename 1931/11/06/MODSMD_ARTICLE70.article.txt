# FIRST-ROUND NOVICE MATCHES TO END BY DEFAULT TOMORROW
## 
### 
With only two matches remaining
in novice tennis tournament first
round play, defaults will halt fur
ther delay tomorrow night. Both
lagging contests are in the freshman
division —Harris vs. Jadarola, and
Mulcahy vs. Grantier.
Yesterday's results were few and
far between. Nothing at all hap
pened in the Babe section, and noth
ing in the sophomore.. One lone en
counter came to a head when Swift
was forced to three sets by Mires,
6-4, 2-6, 6-4, in the junior group.
Seniors confined their activity to a
single contest, Kennedy vs. Ferns,
which also went to three sets, finally
ending in a 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory for
Kennedy.
Ransom, of the yearlings, is still
the lone semifinalist; he is due to
face either Pinckney, Jadarola or
Harris in time, but the latter two
have hardly had a chance to deter
mine Ransom's opponent as yet,
since Jadarola gained the third
round only yesterday. Huston is the
only other quarterfinalist in the
freshman division who has no oppo
nent as yet; Mulcahy and Grantier
will fight it out for the position.
Others who are ahead of schedule
enough to lack a quarterfinal oppo
nent are Coles and Swift, of the
juniors, and Kennedy, of the fourth
year men. Sophomores have filled
all their quarterfinal brackets.
