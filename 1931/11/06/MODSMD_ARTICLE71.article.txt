# GRAYS CLASH WITH GOOFS NOVEMBER 14
## 
### 
Stanford Grays will meet the Cali
; fornia Goof team in the Stadium on
I November 14. The game will be
j played as a preliminary to the var
sity elash with Nevada, and is sched-
I uled to start at 11:30 o'clock.
The date of the game had pre
sented a problem until the mana
! gerial staffs of the two schools got
together and reached an agreement.
| At first California objected to the
; date of the contest, and wished to
j play this Saturday, but later receded
I from their stand.

During a milk drivers' strike in
Glasgow, Scotland, recently, wagons
' were overturned, milk poured out,
| and lists of customers destroyed by
i the strikers.
