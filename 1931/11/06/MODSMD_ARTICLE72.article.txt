# J. C. TRACKMEN 1932 PROSPECTS
## Ferrie And Stallings May Strengthen Varsity 
### Dick Strouse 
Stanford's 1932 track prospects do
not depend entirely upon the abil
ity of the men returning from last
year's freshman and varsity squads.
For there are two junior collegc
transfers now in school who should
add considerable strength to this
spring's team. These men are Jim
Ferrie and Dean Stallings.
Ferrie ran for Glendale J.C. dur
ing the last two years, and while
there hung up an enviable record in
the distance races. He is credited
with a 1:56 half-mile and mark of
4:26 in the mile run. Perhaps Fer
rie's outstanding race was his vic
tory in the mile at the A.A.U. meet
a year ago last spring. In that race,
Ferrie beat a gentleman by the
name of Halstead who has been
running for a school located some
where down south, known as the
University of Southern California.
Halstead won the mile last year
in the Stanford-U.S.C. meet, no
that Ferrie's victory is particularly
cheering to Cardinal rooters. Fer
rie has not been able to run yet this
year because of a tonsil operation,
but when he does get into shape
he should be stepping along with
the best of them.
Stallings, Hurdler
Stallings is the present holder of
two Utah and Idaho junior college
hurdle records. He ran for West
minster J.C. in Salt Lake City, and
his best marks are 15:1 in the highs
and 25:1 in the lows. An injury has
kept Stallings out of competition so
far this year, so that his progress
under the Templeton system of
coaching cannot yet be judged.
The graduation of Captain Podge
Smith, A1 Nisbet, Bob Brown, Dick
Wright and Johnnie Parker of last
year's team makes the addition of
Ferrie and Stallings exceedingly
valuable. It is probable that Ferrie
will work with Sam Eastman and
Bob Atkinson in the mile, leaving
Frank Fullenwider and Ben East
man to take care of the 880. Ferrie
can on occasion run the two-mile as
well, and there is a chance that he
will help Paul Aebersold and Art
Azevedo garner points in this event.
Smith, Nisbet Good
Stallings should help fill a large
gap in the hurdles, as Nisbet and
Smith were two of the best timber
toppers in the country last year. At
the present time, Jack Brugman,
who won the highs in Wednesday's
practice meet in :15.8, is the ranking
high hurdler. Dave Packard, who
ran 120 yards of track jumping three
and one-half foot sticks every 10
yards in :15.3 while captain of last
year's frosh track team, is also a
i fine possibility. Podge Smith says
these three men are as good as any
thing U.S.C. can offer.
