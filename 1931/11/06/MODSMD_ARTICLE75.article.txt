# SECOND TEAM IMPROVES PLAY; HOLDS VARSITY SOCCERMEN TO 2-1 VICTORY
## 
### K. W 
A fighting second team, showing '
j more team-work every day, held
j the varsity soccer team to a 2-1
1 win yesterday afternoon; and both
â–  teams were using their own back
, field combination in the bargain.
| The varsity scored first when Ted
i Beggs drove one between the posts
| soon after practice started. The
seconds came right back and fought
[ the first team back into their own
| territory, where Miguel, playing in
| side-right, netted a nice corner
i kick from Jimmy Bednar.
For the rest of the afternoon the
| battle was about even, until Beggs
i took matters into his own hands
j and banged another past the sub
| stitutes' goalie. After that Coach
i Maloney sent the boys home for the
I week-end. There is no practice to
| day.
I The varsity's cripple list vanished
' with the return to the squad of
Johnny Mooro, stellar center-half.
i Moore still favors the injured foot,
but hopes to be in shape for the
visiting San Mateans next Tuesday.
I Both Moore and Beggs are San Ma

' teo alumni, and were instrumental
in Stanford's first victory over the
Jaysee men.
Coach Eberhart continue driving
his freshmen at top speed in prepa
ration for their game with Tamal
pais High next week.
Rojas, yearling center - forward,
: still has an annoying "charley
horse," that seems to be getting no
better. It is hoped that the three
! day rest will round him into shape
1 again.
The boys certainly got out in a
hurry. Maybe someone told them
I that the Quad photographer might
be around.
