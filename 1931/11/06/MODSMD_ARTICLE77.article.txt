# CHEAP APPARATUS CREATES VOLTAGE TO UNLOCK ATOM
## Commercial Transmutation Of Elements' Power Made Possible 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (JP). —A rev
olutionary electrical discovery an
nounced as promising sufficient
power to realize the theorist's dream
of commercial transmutation of the
elements was made public tonight
by the American Institute of Phys
ics.
With apparatus costing only $90
this discovery produces 1,500,000
volts of the same kind of electricity
as lightning. It will be built up to
15,000,000 to 20,000,000 volts imme
diately and has ultimate possibilities
of a 50,000,000 volt energy.

Proves Practical

The discovery is an idea of a
young scientist, R. J. Van de Graaff,
who graduated from the University
of Alabama in 1922. He conceived it
while working as a Nation Research
Fellow at Oxford University, Eng
land, With the aid of a National
Research Council Fellowship, he
continued this work at. Princeton
and there recently obtained proof
of its practicability.

Now he has joined the staff of the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology where he will develop suf
ficient power to disintegrate atoms.
Atomic Experiment
This makes possible the investi
gation of methods for practical use
of the energy liberated by the atom
ic disintegration. In popular termi
nology, it is an experiment in "un
locking of the energy of the atom."
The 1,500,000-volt apparatus will
be exhibited at the first dinner No
vember 10 in New York of the
American Institute of Physics, a
new scientific organization under di
rection of Dr. Henry A. Barton and
backed by leading American scien
tists. The institute proposes to keep
the public informed upon outstand
ing developments in physics.
