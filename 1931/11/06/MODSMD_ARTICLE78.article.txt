# WILBUR PREPARES TO END COLORADO REAL ESTATE FIGHT
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (/Pi. â€”
Secretary Wilbur today fired what
he hopes will be the final gun in an
incipient land war in Colorado
growing out of the readjustment oi
an old Union Pacific Railroad grant.
He ordered the rejection of a
homestead application filed on land
thrown open to homestead after the
adjustment showed approximately
20,000 acres had been opened to set
tlement by the railroad, although it
held no title to the area.
He furthermore ordered that no
further applications be accepted and
that the ocupants of the land, some
of whom had lived on it for as much
as 50 years, be given every possible
assistance in establishing their title
to it.
