# GORDAN ORGANIZES CLASS IN JUMPING
## 
### 
For those equestrians who don't |
mind rolling out around dawn, Cap- |
tain Richard A. Gordan has organ
ized a military jumping class that ;
meets cach morning at eight o'clock.
Membership is open to any R.O.T.C.
student.
Although no credit .is given for j
the course, more than a dozen men (
have turned out to share in the ?
thrills and spills that come with this |
sport. Because of many inexperi- !
enced riders, jumps so far have all j
been kept under the three-foot |
mark.
