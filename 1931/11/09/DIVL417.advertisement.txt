MODERN DANCES
LUDWIG'S STUDIOS
Dear Reader:
Why be a mere dancer? A short
time with a "Specialist" will put
that modern "snap" to your
dancing.
Ludwig's experienced young
lady and men teachers "special
ize" entirely upon personal in
struction. This imparts that
"smartness," and "modernism"
which denotes style. Engage the
services of one of LUDWIG'S
specialists in place of employing
an ordinary teacher, at no addi
tional cost.
BALLROOM and TAP lessons
all day and evening. Evening
classes at 8:45. Remember, LUD
WIG'S WAYâ€”"AS EASY AS
WALKING." Sincerely,
Ludwig's Studios
640 14th St., Oakland, TE. 6632
Also Studios 532 Geary St, S.F.
