DAILY
For the College Year
Send it home to your folks instead of
writing a four-page letter every day.
Maybe your chum back home would
like to know what Stanford is doing.
Give them all a chance to find out
what Stanford is really like by sending
them the Daily during the remainder
of the school year for $3.50.
CALL AT THE DAILY OFFICE NEXT TO THE PRESS
BUILDING AND PLACE YOUR HOME ADDRESS ON
OUR MAILING LIST OR SEND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
