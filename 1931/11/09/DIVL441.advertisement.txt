CAMELS are merer pareh or
JTRESHNESS and flavor in a cigarette trace right
back to natural moisture.
If you overheat or process tobacco so harshly as
to dry out all natural moisture you drive out fresh
ness and flavor too.
Camel never parches or toasts the fine Turkish and
mild Domestic tobaccos it uses—they are naturally
smooth, cool, mellow, with natural moisture retained.

That's why the Camel Humidor Pack proves such a
blessing to Camel smokers —it brings them a fine
cigarette fresh to start with, and fresh to smoke.
If you don't realize what natural moisture means in
genuine freshness and flavor, switch to Camels and see.
Try this mild, slow-burning, throat-friendly
favorite for just one day —then leave it, if you can!
