# MYSTERY VEILS SHIP CRASH IN FOG OFF MARIN
## Confused Observation Of Beacon Lights Held As One Theory ENTIRE CREW SAVED Salvagers Abandon Wreck As Total Loss 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8. (/P)—
A fog-like curtain of mystery yes
terday overhung the wreck of the
big steel freighter Munleon on the
rocks of Point Reyes Saturday night.
With the crew of twenty-five men,
taken off by Coast Guard rescuers
and transported safely to San Fran
cisco yesterday morning aboard the
cutter Shawnee, an investigation
was begun by the McCormick
Steamship Company, owners of the
lost vessel.
Total Loss
Meanwhile the Munleon, its steel !
sheathing ripped open by the giant
tooth of rock upon whieh it was im
paled, was gradually being broken
up by the fierce onset of sea and
gale. Prospective salvagers, who
hurried to the scene, gave her up
as a total loss.
Some of the seamen discussed the
incident on their way to San Fran
cisco, but upon arrival all were in
structed by company officials to
keep silent until the official Federal
hearing.
Confusion Blamed
Frank Deming, quartermaster,
gave en route here the only lucid j
explanation of what might have
caused the wreck. He was at the
wheel. Capt. O. J. Hengst had gone
below to his quarters, leaving Third
Officer Chris Nielsen on the bridge.
According to Deming, the third j
officer apparently became confused j
in his observation of beacon lights, j
and, believing he had rounded the
"westernmost tip of Point Reyes, ■
proceeded on a northwest course in- |
stead of one almost due west.
Hit at Full Speed
"He gave me a course of north
west," said Quartermaster Deming.
"Later on he asked me what course
I was on and I told him northwest.
He must have realized it was a mis
take, but it was too late.
"We hit going full speed ahead,
about 11 knots. The crash threw the
third mate forward with such force
as to bruise his nose against the |
bridge."
