# OLYMPICS DOWN GALLOPING GAELS
## 10-0 Defeat Is First Loss For Moragans 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8.
St. Mary's brilliant gridiron record
was shattered today when the Gaels
suffered their first defeat of the sea
son, a 10 to 0 setback by the Olympic
Club of San Francisco.
The club team previously had lost
to California and Santa Clara and
also had been held to ties by the
University of San Francisco and
Stanford.
Playing in heady fashion, the club
eleven seized a St. Mary's fumble to
put over a touchdown in the first
period, while in the last quarter a
40-yard place kick added three
more points. The first club score
came after St. Mary's fumbled on
its 27-yard line. After driving up
to the five-yard line, Buerke, for
mer Oregon State quarterback,
tossed a pass to Leggett over the
goal line. Davis place-kicked the try
for point.
Two scoreless periods followed. In
the last quarter, Black, substitute
end, was sent in to try for a place
kick. The ball landed on the cross
bar and bounced over.
