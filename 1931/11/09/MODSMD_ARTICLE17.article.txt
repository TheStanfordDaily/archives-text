# Farm's First Registrar Recalls Days Of Yore
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
If it isn't in the "bible" ask Mr.
Elliott.
Orrin Leslie Elliott was Stanford's
first registrar. Yesterday, in the
simple, book-lined study of his
home on Lagunita Knoll, he recalled
the days when Palo Alto consisted
of one house and one barn; and
some trains stopped if flagged.
"Busses drawn by horses carried
one to the campus," he said. "How
ever, they only came out when they
had a fare and so the schedule here
was very uncertain. The trolley era
commenced about 1908."
Originally the post office was at
Menlo Park. Mail was delivered at
Roble, Encina, and the registrar's
office. The first post office on the
campus was a small frame building
which stood on the site of the Me

morial Church. When the Govern
ment suit was settled in favor of
the University, the students, led by
Dr. Wilbur, then a senior, painted
it red. The present building, the
"P. 0.," stood through the earth
quake and dates from about 1900.
The automobile to appear on
the campus arrived in 1899. The
owner came to take Dr. Jordan up
Mt. Hamilton. Elliott said the news
papers were full of the feat. They
stated that no automobile had ever
been so high. The trip of 27 miles
| was accomplished in five hours and
j 14 minutes, considered to be record
breaking time. At Mrs. Stanford's
request no machines were allowed
on Palm Drive until 1912. By that
j time it was the undisputed right of
| way of pedestrians, since buggies
j were practically extinct.
