## National Congress Brands Parley "Failure" In Cable To Leader 
### 
BOMBAY, India, Nov. 8.
serting the British government had
failed to grant its demands for in
dependence, the Indian National
Congress today cabled Mahatma
Gandhi in London that his further
attendance at the round table con
ference was unnecessary and urged
him to return to India at once.
While leaving the final decision to
Gandhi, the congress' working com
mittee adopted a resolution saying
"the people of India should not al
low themselves to be deflected from
the right path, but should organize
themselves and prepare for united
effective action." Recent attempts by
radicals on the lives of British of
ficials were condemned.
May Quit Europe Tour
Gandhi was asked to abandon his
proposed tour of Europe and come
home at the earliest moment on the
additional grounds that British au
thorities were using oppresive
measures against the peasants in
Bengal, the northwest frontier
province, the United Provinces, and
other districts.
