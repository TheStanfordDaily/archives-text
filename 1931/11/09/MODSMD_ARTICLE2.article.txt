# STAINED GLASS DOME IN AD BUILDING WILL UNDERGO REPAIRS
## 
### 
Repairs will soon start on the
stained glass dome of the Adminis
tration Building, under which a bar
rier of tables has been placed to
guard against the possibility of the
loose bits of glass falling on some
one.
Considerable overhauling will be
done on the lower course around
the dome, which is so warped and
sagged as to cause strain on the
glass. University architects, Bake
well and Brown, examined the
building Saturday in an effort to
find a plan of repairing the dome,
but the amount of necessary repairs
has not yet been determined. The
last repairs to the dome were made
approximately two years ago.
