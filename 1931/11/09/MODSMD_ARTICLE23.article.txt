# Turkish Team Debates Cards Tuesday Night
## Howard Conn And Leonard Bloom Hold Negative 
### 
That "the world has more to fear
from Fascism than from Bolshevism"
will be the argument advanced by
two Turkish debaters, A. Galib Rifat
and Suha Zeki, when they meet rep
resentatives of the Stanford debat
ing squad in the Assembly Hall to
morrow night at 8 o'clock. Proof
they offer will be bitterly contested
by Howard Conn and Leonard
Bloom, Stanford speakers, in the
negative view of the issue.
According to John Gange, Stan
ford debate manager, the visitors
must show that the planned order
of Bolshevism is much the better of
the two sides. Fascism takes pride
in the fact that it has no definite
program, that above all it is action
and sentiment, and as such the
world has knowledge of its aims and
intentions. Fascism holds no prom
ise of a millenium, nor does it
openly announce to the world that
it shall seek to spread its doctrine,
even by force if necessary, through
out the nations of the world to the
glorification of the "proletariat."
Still, there are those who point
toward the sword-rattling of the
Fascist leaders, to the blatant na
tionalists, whose chauvinistic mani
festations threaten the peace of
southern Europe, as evidence of the
aim of the Fascisti to advance their
ideal throughout the world.
Professor T. S. Barclay will pre
side at the debate. A student body
card or 50 cents will admit those
anticipating attendance at the inter
national forensic duel.
