# GAIETIES CHORUSES REHEARSE TONIGHT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
There will be a full rehearsal of
the Gaieties choruses at 7 o'clock
tonight in the Assembly Hall under
the direction of Terry Brickley.
Both the regular and specialties
choruses will report.
Full rehearsal of all the sketches
submitted up to that time will be
held under the supervision of Harold
Helvenston in the Little Theatre to
morrow at 7 o'clock.
The turnout of unusual and
unique material has been gratifying
ly large and prophesies a bigger and
better Ram's Head Football Gaieties
than ever before. The deadline for
new original sketches has been defi
nitely set as tomorrow night. No
acts will have been definitely set
tled upon until that time.
There is still time for anyone with
new song ideas to submit them to
Roger Sumner, musical director, if
they act immediately.
