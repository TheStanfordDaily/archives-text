# CUBAN CITY TO TRY MOTORCYCLE POLICE
## 
### 
HAVANA, Nov. 8. (JP) â€” After
three centuries' experience with all
kinds of traffic Havana decided to
try the motorcycle cop.
In this man's town which, to the
tourist, resembles a cross between
Paris and the Indianapolis speed- i
way, the newcomer is going to have j
his hands full. Nonpartisan by- j
standers are waiting until the new j
speed cop meets one of Cuba's taxi j
drivers in a rush through the nar- |
row streets of old Havana.
