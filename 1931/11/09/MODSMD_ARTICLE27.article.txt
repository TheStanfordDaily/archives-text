# Cards Battered By Great Trojan Eleven, 19 To 0
## Stanford Line Overpowered by U.S.C. Forward Wail While Southern Backs Get Away for Long Gains; Mohler Scores Twice for S.C. LOSS OF MOFFATT DAMAGES RED MACHINE Warner's Fancy Defense Proves Inadequate Against Trojan Power; Rintala Gains by Trickery 
### LOWELL COX 
ANGELES, Nov. B.—Far improved over last >ear, a fighting Stanford
varsity put up a whale of a battle against Southern California in the
Olympic Stadium yesterday, but it was not equal to the occasion.
Southern California 19, Stanford 0. That just about tells the story of
Trojan superiority over Pop Warner's "mystery" team, which, was de
prived of its greatest offensive threat, Phil Moffatt, after the first play.
With Moffatt the Indians would not have won from Troy but they
probably would have scored at least once. Phil was hurt while running
the ball back on the opening kick-off of the game. Giving promise of
what might have been expected of him later in the game, Moffat wormed

> his way to the 34-yard line before
he was downed by Ernie Smith, Tro
jan guard.
Moffatt's Knee Hurt
Although bothered by a knee
badly injured on the tackle,
Moffatl attempted to stay in the
game. After one more play,
Moffatt found it necessary to
leave the field. It was a sad blow
to Stanford and to Phil, whose
college grid career may be at an
end. It is probable that he will
riot be able to play in the Big
Game.
Hardy went in for Moffatt and
played a fine game until he, too,
was injured, and gave way to Camp
bell.
Stanford fought every inch of the
way but was not a match for the
Howard Jones eleven. The Indian
line, while not as badly outplayed
as last year, was not the equal of
that powerful Trojan forward wall.
U.S.C. Backs Great
Probably the greatets margin of
superiority was in the U.S.C. back
field. Mohler, Pinckert, Shaver,
Musick, and company were truly
great. Stopped many times at the
line of scrimmage, they often got
away for long gains when once past
it. The much-publicized Mohler
lived up to his reputation in every
way, as did the hard-blocking
Pinckert. Mohler scored two of the
Trojan touchdowns and Shaver one.
Mystery team? It proved to be a
good team but not a great one as it
put up its first big battle of the
season. Unquestionably it would
have been better with Moffatt, but
not good enough to stop the batter
ing men of Troy.
Warner Tricks
"Pop" had some tricks up his
sleeve, some of which were good,
and others not so good. He had
evolved a new defense designed to
stop those powerful off-tackle
sweeps by using five men on the
line of scrimmage with the' ends
drawn back. It availed little against
the most perfect interference that
the Trojans have presented, and the
Indians were forced to use a six
man line for most of the game.
Hidden Ball Play
The Old Man had developed
the hidden ball play which
worked to perfection and which
might have produced a score by
itself with Moffatt carrying the
ball. Rintala worked it success
fully several times. Hiding the
ball behind his hip he sneaked
around left end without inter
ference while the other backs
stampeded to the right. Once he
very nearly got away, with only
the safety man remaining be
tween himself and the goal line.
The Stanford passing attack was
the biggest disappointment of all.
When at one time it might have
produced a score as the Indians
worked deep into Trojan territory,
Allen threw over the goal line. Tim
i ing was perfect but Colvin, for
J whom the pass was intended, slipped
] and fell and the ball was batted
| down.
The Indians completed but two out
of sixteen passes for the grand total
of 11 yards. One short five-yard
pass by Rintala of a type which was
apparently safe ' from interception
was grabbed by Stevens in the last
quarter to pave the way for the final
U.S.C. touchdown. Stevens took it
on the Indian 10-yard line and ran
to the thx-ee. Mohler went over for
the score on the second play.
Captain Harry Hillman played the
best offensive game he has turned
! in this season. He was probably the
j outstanding backfield man for the
; Indians, with Corbus being rated
highly by Trojan players" for his line
performance.
There are 698 public schools in
New York city.

as last year, was not the equal of
that powerful Trojan forward wall.
U.S.C. Backs Great
Probably the greatets margin of
superiority was in the U.S.C. back
field. Mohler, Pinckert, Shaver,
Musick, and company were truly
great. Stopped many times at the
line of scrimmage, they often got
away for long gains when once past
it. The much-publicized Mohler
lived up to his reputation in every
way, as did the hard-blocking
Pinckert. Mohler scored two of the
Trojan touchdowns and Shaver one.
Mystery team? It proved to be a
good team but not a great one as it
put up its first big battle of the
season. Unquestionably it would
have been better with Moffatt, but
not good enough to stop the batter
ing men of Troy.
Warner Tricks
"Pop" had some tricks up his
sleeve, some of which were good,
and others not so good. He had
evolved a new defense designed to
stop those powerful off-tackle
sweeps by using five men on the
line of scrimmage with the' ends
drawn back. It availed little against
the most perfect interference that
the Trojans have presented, and the
Indians were forced to use a six
man line for most of the game.
Hidden Ball Play
The Old Man had developed
the hidden ball play which
worked to perfection and which
might have produced a score by
itself with Moffatt carrying the
ball. Rintala worked it success
fully several times. Hiding the
ball behind his hip he sneaked
around left end without inter
ference while the other backs
stampeded to the right. Once he
very nearly got away, with only
the safety man remaining be
tween himself and the goal line.
The Stanford passing attack was
the biggest disappointment of all.
When at one time it might have
produced a score as the Indians
worked deep into Trojan territory,
Allen threw over the goal line. Tim
i ing was perfect but Colvin, for
J whom the pass was intended, slipped
] and fell and the ball was batted
| down.
The Indians completed but two out
of sixteen passes for the grand total
of 11 yards. One short five-yard
pass by Rintala of a type which was
apparently safe ' from interception
was grabbed by Stevens in the last
quarter to pave the way for the final
U.S.C. touchdown. Stevens took it
on the Indian 10-yard line and ran
to the thx-ee. Mohler went over for
the score on the second play.
Captain Harry Hillman played the
best offensive game he has turned
! in this season. He was probably the
j outstanding backfield man for the
; Indians, with Corbus being rated
highly by Trojan players" for his line
performance.

ANGELES, Nov. B.—Far improved over last >ear, a fighting Stanford
varsity put up a whale of a battle against Southern California in the
Olympic Stadium yesterday, but it was not equal to the occasion.
Southern California 19, Stanford 0. That just about tells the story of
Trojan superiority over Pop Warner's "mystery" team, which, was de
prived of its greatest offensive threat, Phil Moffatt, after the first play.
With Moffatt the Indians would not have won from Troy but they
probably would have scored at least once. Phil was hurt while running
the ball back on the opening kick-off of the game. Giving promise of
what might have been expected of him later in the game, Moffat wormed

> his way to the 34-yard line before
he was downed by Ernie Smith, Tro
jan guard.
Moffatt's Knee Hurt
Although bothered by a knee
badly injured on the tackle,
Moffatl attempted to stay in the
game. After one more play,
Moffatt found it necessary to
leave the field. It was a sad blow
to Stanford and to Phil, whose
college grid career may be at an
end. It is probable that he will
riot be able to play in the Big
Game.
Hardy went in for Moffatt and
played a fine game until he, too,
was injured, and gave way to Camp

the biggest disappointment of all.
When at one time it might have
produced a score as the Indians
worked deep into Trojan territory,
Allen threw over the goal line. Tim
i ing was perfect but Colvin, for
J whom the pass was intended, slipped
] and fell and the ball was batted
| down.
The Indians completed but two out
of sixteen passes for the grand total
of 11 yards. One short five-yard
pass by Rintala of a type which was
apparently safe ' from interception
was grabbed by Stevens in the last
quarter to pave the way for the final
U.S.C. touchdown. Stevens took it
on the Indian 10-yard line and ran
to the thx-ee. Mohler went over for
the score on the second play.
Captain Harry Hillman played the
best offensive game he has turned
! in this season. He was probably the
j outstanding backfield man for the
; Indians, with Corbus being rated
highly by Trojan players" for his line
performance.
