I Ins business of losing football games to the Trojans
is getting to be too much of a habit. Four straight wins
over a team coached by Pop Warner is a record that no
other team lias ever approached.
And the Trojans with straight football won fairly and
squarely; they outplayed and outfought'the Indians from
the start in a game that never touched the heights that
either team is capable of reaching.
The loss of Phil Moffatt was expected, hut it was unfor
tunate that it happened so early in the game. The final out
come might have been the same, but the score probably
would have been different.
However, we are not offering any alibis; S.C. put up
winning football and that is what it takes to bring home
the bacon, or rather, the pigskin.
