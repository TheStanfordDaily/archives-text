# DANISH GAS MASKS NEAR PERFECTION
## 
### 
COPENHAGEN, Nov. 8. (/P)â€”A
filter for gas masks which excludes
99.8 per cent of all poisons from the
breathing tubes has been invented
by the Danish chemist, N. L. Han
sen, and with it he has evolved an
elaborate plan for the protection of
cities against air raids dealing gas.
Denmark is disarmed. It has no
military forces. But experiments
with poison gases have been con
tinued by military chemists against
the day when Denmark might pos
sibly be the object of such an at
tack.
