Just eight days after today remain in which to perfect
plans for and complete the erection of Stanford's Big
(tame bonfire.
For years it has been part of the freshman class activity
to furnish man-power for building the great pyre for the
Golden Bear. In years when the pile was burned prema
turely a day or two before the rally, the whole student
body turned out to build greater than before where ashes
were still smoking.
This year, the plans, if any, have been kept a deep dark
secret and it is time that they be taking definite form.
