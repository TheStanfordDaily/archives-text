# GIVE. THE OTHER GUY A BREAK
## 
### 
Every year about this time, 1 , complaints about the sys
tem of parking near the Library are noised about. People
who own cars seem to forget the grief and annoyance of
receiving a ticket for improper parking, not to mention
forgetting the inconvenience to the driver who comes out
of the building to find his car effectively boxed inside a
circle three or four deep.
Temporary relief is obtained when a traffic officer
equipped with reams of tags is on duty at the Li he for
short periods from time to time, hut before long the cars
are again hanked in disorderly fashion.
Even if you don't mind getting a summons to appear
before one of the councils, think of the other fellow when
you leave your car and go in for a couple of hours of "good
solid study."
