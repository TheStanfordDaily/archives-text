# IF FOOTRALL DECLINES

### 
Yale's gymnasium director, Dr. William G. Anderson,
foresees a decline in the popularity of football as the great
est drawing card in intercollegiate sports and goes on to
point to the analogy of the seven fat years and the seven
lean years, saying that football all over the country has
enjoyed its seven fat years.
Dr. Anderson may be right, for he certainly is in a
position to "get the inside dope." And if he is right, then
the athletic managerial staffs of many universities and col
leges all over the country are going to he hard put to
smooth out the financial difficulties attendant upon the
decrease. •
Despite frequent predictions of such a decline, athletic
plants in educational institutions have been started on am
bitious programs of expansion, both in buildings and in
investments in equipment, that are dependent for revenue
upon the iqcome from football. In some colleges, football
is the only sport which pays its own way and deficits in
other lines are made up with funds from football.
In cases like this, it is easy to see what would happen
to athletic development if the income were cut off.
We hope Dr. Anderson is wrong.
