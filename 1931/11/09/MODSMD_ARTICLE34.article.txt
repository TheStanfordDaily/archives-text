# BULL SESSION
## 
### NOW, THAT RALLY 
It is somewhat late but none the
less necessary to talk about that so
called U.S.C. pep rally held in the
Pavilion last Wednesday; the Bull
Session has withheld comment so
that anything we might say could
not contribute to the team's effec
tiveness in the Saturday game. Hail
ing from Southern California (the
area and not the University), it was
only a natural manifestation of the
instinct of self-preservation that
prompeted us to restrain from any
thing that might hurt chances for
victory. To.live in the Bay Region
and have Stanford lose to S.C. is
bad; but to live in Southern Cali
fornia and have Stanford lose to
S.C. is indescribable.
The horse episode in Wednesday's
debacle was unfortunate, but that is
all one can say. One cannot blame
the Chappie funnymen for not
knowing the mysteries and intrica
cies of equestrian psychology; but
they should have realized that any
thing—an inexperienced yell leader,
a horse, or a debater might become
somewhat startled before a mob of
noise-making creatures. Yet it was
Mike (of the stables) —the unpre
pared and completely extemporane
ous performer that saved the eve
ning from being almost a complete
bore.
The purpose of rallies, it seems, is
to work up enthusiasm in the stu
dent body and give the team the
correct psychology for the encounter
that is to follow. How anyone can
sit on a hard, inelastic wooden floor

for over an hour and still be en
thusiastic about anything except
getting up is beyond our compre
hension. We sat on the floor and we
yelled whenever they told us to, but
the bunch that left the Pavilion
would be characterized not by en
thusiasm, but by .stiffness. And those
that sat on the bleachers may not
have been stiff; they were just plain
bored with nothing to occupy their
attention but the program. Those on
the floor, however, had one advan
tage; their interest was divided be
tween what was going on and trying
to find a soft spot on the floor.
There are certain advantages to a
purely masculine student body, but
those advantages have to be sacri
ficed when even so fdw as 500
women were present. Some of the
so-called jokes Wednesday were in
the Encina tradition and surely not
fit for a mixed audience. The Stan
ford rough may be masculine to the
extreme, but he is supposed to be a
gentleman as well.
The team and their coach are to be
complimented on being able to sit
through that which was to be a pep
rally in their honor and finally
turned out to be tryouts for Euphro
nia—very extinct debating society.
Speeches have their place—and a
worthwhile place—but that place is
not at a pep rally. A few words from
the captain and the coach is all that
is and a short exagger
ated talk that only an alumnus can
give without blushing may be in
order, but after that, absolutely no
more. —Abe Mellinkoff

attention but the program. Those on
the floor, however, had one advan
tage; their interest was divided be
tween what was going on and trying
to find a soft spot on the floor.
There are certain advantages to a
purely masculine student body, but
those advantages have to be sacri
ficed when even so fdw as 500
women were present. Some of the
so-called jokes Wednesday were in
the Encina tradition and surely not
fit for a mixed audience. The Stan
ford rough may be masculine to the
extreme, but he is supposed to be a
gentleman as well.
The team and their coach are to be
complimented on being able to sit
through that which was to be a pep
rally in their honor and finally
turned out to be tryouts for Euphro
nia—very extinct debating society.
Speeches have their place—and a
worthwhile place—but that place is
not at a pep rally. A few words from
the captain and the coach is all that
is and a short exagger
ated talk that only an alumnus can
give without blushing may be in
order, but after that, absolutely no
more. —Abe Mellinkoff
It is somewhat late but none the
less necessary to talk about that so
called U.S.C. pep rally held in the
Pavilion last Wednesday; the Bull
Session has withheld comment so
that anything we might say could
not contribute to the team's effec
tiveness in the Saturday game. Hail
ing from Southern California (the
area and not the University), it was
only a natural manifestation of the
instinct of self-preservation that
prompeted us to restrain from any
thing that might hurt chances for
victory. To.live in the Bay Region
and have Stanford lose to S.C. is
bad; but to live in Southern Cali
fornia and have Stanford lose to
S.C. is indescribable.
The horse episode in Wednesday's
debacle was unfortunate, but that is
all one can say. One cannot blame
the Chappie funnymen for not
knowing the mysteries and intrica
cies of equestrian psychology; but
they should have realized that any
thing—an inexperienced yell leader,
a horse, or a debater might become
somewhat startled before a mob of
noise-making creatures. Yet it was
Mike (of the stables) —the unpre
pared and completely extemporane
ous performer that saved the eve
ning from being almost a complete
bore.
The purpose of rallies, it seems, is
to work up enthusiasm in the stu
dent body and give the team the
correct psychology for the encounter
that is to follow. How anyone can
sit on a hard, inelastic wooden floor

for over an hour and still be en
thusiastic about anything except
getting up is beyond our compre
hension. We sat on the floor and we
yelled whenever they told us to, but
the bunch that left the Pavilion
would be characterized not by en
thusiasm, but by .stiffness. And those
that sat on the bleachers may not
have been stiff; they were just plain
bored with nothing to occupy their
attention but the program. Those on
the floor, however, had one advan
tage; their interest was divided be
tween what was going on and trying
to find a soft spot on the floor.
