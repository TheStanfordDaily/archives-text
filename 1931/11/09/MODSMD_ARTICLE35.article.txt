TRAVELING HUSBANDS—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Here we have the typically un
novel plot and time-worn gags
whven about a group of philander
ing husbands who traveled for more
than business. But characteristically
enough there is one splendid por
trayal—Evelyn Brent as the shady
lady. Just the one outstanding part
in an otherwise shabby play.
Dorothy Peterson, as the loving
and bitterly "done-in" wife, is good
—a fine, stable, upright good that is
noteworthy if only because of the
contrast. Frank Albertson, as the
juvenile lead, plays an inconsequen
tial part, really, although most of
the thrills, as they're called, center
around him in the impressive role
of killer.
There are traveling husbands, by
the way, and telephone operators,
so that the picture lives up to its
name. And there is whiskey for
booze, and an unforgiving father,
and in spite of another theme song,
happiness for all in the end.

THE . ROAD TO SINGAPORE—At
the New Stanford Theatre.
William Powell, again, at his
smooth best. This is the story of
another disappointed wife, who
finds herself married to a surgical
genius who is apparently without
regard for humanity as human be
ings. Worse yet, it all happens in
the tropics, where amusements and
companionship are scarce; so she
turns to the handsome Powell,
tabooed because of his affairs with
various other men's wives—and the
ending is satisfactory and different.
Marian Marsh is as appealing a
"younger sister" as we ever hope
to see. In the role of the disappointed
wife, Doris Kenyon is convincingly
sincere, although one might hope
for a bit more of true beauty in a
leading lady. More than any other

member of the cast she persuades
us that the suffocating tropical heat
is genuine. Incidentally, the scen
| ery and the natives are real.
On the same bill is an excellent
I short film, one of Mack Sennett's
| thrillers of deep sea fishing as it is
: actually done; also a lesson in the
j three essentials of tennis playing by
| none other than THE Bill Tilden.
i The pictures of the S.C. game Sat
urday are interesting—the glimpse
| of a rooters' stunt being the most
' pleasing to the local audience.

j THE COMMON LAW—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
The reason why young, noble, and
-Upright young artists should never
! believe what their friends tell them
j about other people, and be cautious
| in believing what they see as well.
I Connie Bennett is lovely, as usual,
; and her gowns are almost too good
. looking to be true.
Miss Bennett this time is an artist's
model, misunderstood and really
very nice, and having rather a hard

! time convincing her artist-lover of
j the fact.
| The hero owns a magnificent
yacht; and glimpses of the Bal des
j Quatres Arts play up the daring
| and piquancy of Continental life ef
fectively.
\ Connie Bennett artistically se
duced, again. Joel Mcßae is the pure
"boy. —J.H.
