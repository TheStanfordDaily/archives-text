A grimy week-end, and still
we can smile! Now that the un
derdog is still the underdog, we
have something to look forward
to in the Big Game. As if foot
ball really mattered anyhow,
ha ha! (Yes, ha ha!!)
We take off our hat, though, and
! hand all the available laurel wreaths,
| unreservedly, to one Charles Spring-
I er Ehrhorn, who hasn't yet pulled a
| noticeable boner, and who usually
! manages to come out head and
! shoulders above the rest of the
crowd. (Ge{ it, Oscar? He's tall . . .)
Early Sunday morning, down
there in fhe Sunny Southland,
the indomitable Indian sense of
humor came into the spotlight
once again. Two weary youths,
homeward bound, stopped to
gaze in the window of a fruit
and vegetable market, and no
ticed a mound of neatly stacked
rhubarb stalks. "Hell!" said one
of them, or words to that effect;
"we shouldn't feel so terrible.
Even the celery looks blood
shot!"
As our rival columnist, the Sports
Editor, will doubtless tell you all
over his page this morning, our own
little red and white* frosh team
looked about as good as anything
we've heard about, Saturday, even,
if the UC babes are pretty fancy,
j Maybe we have a future, after all.
This is about as good a time as
i any to give you all a little moral
j lesson, about the staunch upright
j ness of the law, and always turning
i the other cheek after a blow. A
j couple of weeks ago we had an edi
| torial that said what a great guy
j our campus copper was about giving
i friendly warnings and not so many
i tickets. Since that time, we're laying
! a ten-to-one bet, cars that belong
| in the vicinity of the Press Building
| have been presented with more tags
! for weird parking than any other
I two dozen on the campus. Such
| stuff!
What a swell chance Cal would
have had to paint this campus
! blue and gold, if they'd wanted
I to, Saturday night, what with
us all far, far away, and even
! San Francisco not quite big
enough for all of them to gloat
! in ' '
; And now all the talk of the cam
j pus will be Big Game Gaieties, for
I a couple of weeks. Those of us who

remember Marshall Kirby & Co.,
and even those who point to Gould
and Carter as the epitome of what
a Gaieties act should be, wonder
each succeeding year how the show
can be anything but a flop, 'this
time." But something always hap
pens. ' \
Today's the day when your profs
will pull fast ones all through class
time, thinking that you're asleep and
'may make a mistake and laugh.
Watch for 'em:
Louis XVI was gelatined.
Virgil was the mother of
Christ.
The Mediterranean and Red
seas are connected by the Sew
age Canal.
Martin Luther was excom
municated by a bull.
And all those other awful
things that only a man with
initials after his name can per
petrate.
