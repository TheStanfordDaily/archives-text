# Inspired Yearlings Hold Touted Bear Cubs, 7-0
## Moore Outstanding For Fighting Losers Meek and Klein Star For Little Big Game Invaders; Card Babes Stop Vaunted Running Attack 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
ANE rapid, fatal touchdown thrust by the California freshmen upset a
whole afternoon of inspired and determined resistance on the part of
Stanford, Saturday, and U.C. squeezed through the Little Big Game with
a 7-0 victory. It was a heart-breaking loss for the Cardinals to experience,
for they rose to the heights and played their most brilliant game of the
year. Throughout the afternoon they held the "greatest Cal frosh team
in years" on even terms with the exception of those few moments in the
second quarter when the score was made.
The Stanford line did heroic work stopping that vaunted Blue and Gold
running attack. Nottram, Van Kirk, Semmelroth, Abrahamsen all played
themselves out, until they were forced to leave the contest because of

sheer physical exhaustion .or .in
juries. Lettunich was outstanding in
the Stanford forward wall. Bob
Moore was the most impressive back
on the field, and when he was in
jured and left the field in the fourth
quarter the scattered crowd offered
him its heartiest ovation.
Running Plays Stopped
The first quarter was played
mostly in mid-field, with Stanford
holding the Cub running attack cold
and doing all the ball-advancing
itself. With the end of the quarter,
Clint Evans injected a number of
substitutes in the California lind-up.
One of these, Williams, proceeded
to steal the show. After Meek re
covered a fumble near mid-field,
Williams passed to Meek for eight
een yards. The latter narrowly
averted dropping the ball, but jug
gled it until he advanced to the
twenty-yard mark.
Williams repeated with another
pass, this time to Moeller, which
netted a first down on the nine-yard
line. Klein ploughed through for 2
yards, William cut back for 4, and
then Klein, spinning like a top,
rolled over the Stanford line for the
touchdown. Williams converted and
the score was 7 to 0.
Defense Tested
The remainder of the game was
largely played in mid-field. Except
for that one vital blow, the Cali
fornians never penetrated past the
Stanford 30-yard line. The Indians
had a beautiful opportunity to test
the Blue and Gold goal line defense
in the third quarter when Moore
recovered Klein's fumble on the
California 20-yard line. On the next
play Flippin fumbled and Moeller
fell on the ball.
Following this Stanford started
the best sustained drive of the day.
.From where Meek had booted the
Y>all out of bounds on their own
A'-yard line they rolled up four first
clowns in a row, only to see their
advance smashed when Klein
snaltched's Seaver's pass out of the
air/on the California 30-yard line.
( Moore Taken Out
Shortly after Moore was injured
aftter completing a 7-yard gain, and
wh\pn the powerful fullback left the
fielM, with him went the major Car
dinajl offensive threat.
IrÂ£ the closing moments, little Joe
SarVer went into the fray
quickly proceeded to roll up three
California first downs before the
Cardinals solved his style.
KJein of California is a great back,
brilliant line smasher and an always
alert defensive player. Three inter
cepted passes was his quota in Sat
urday's game. Meek played a fine
game at end for U.C. The length of
his punts made up for the Indian
running advances in the first half
and kept Bradshaw's men in their
own half of the field. Furthermore,
he snagged the pass that paved the
way to California's score, besides
recovering a Stanford fumble direct
ly before the Blue and Gold aerial
drive.
