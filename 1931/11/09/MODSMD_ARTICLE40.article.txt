# Huskies Mauled By Angry Bear
## Washington Trounced 13-0 As Schaldach Stars 
### 
California continued definitely on
its upgrade climb by decisively
whipping the Washington Husky 13
to 0 Saturday in the California Me
morial Stadium. Hank Schaldach, in
the Blue and Gold line-up for the
first time since the afternoon when
he led the Bears to a win over
Santa Clara, appeared as his team's
shining light.
In the third quarter one of Schal
dach's frequent quick kicks bounded
to the Washington 12-yard line.
Hufford, kicking from behind the
goal line, booted to the Washington
32, and from this point California
started a drive, featuring Schaldach
and Keefer. On one attempt the fly
ing dutchman galloped through the
line for a 22-yard gain, to leave the
ball resting at the one-yard mark,
and on the next play he scored.
Hank then converted for the extra
point on a drop-kick.
Gill scored the second U.C. touch
down in the last half after the Hus
kies had opened up with a bombard
ment of futile passes. Gill sprinted
in to take one of these aerial shots
to the flat zone, intercepted on the
Washington 37-yard line, and con
tinued on his way for the touch
down.
California's forward wall out
played the Northerners throughout
the game. Even the mighty tackle,
Schwegler, was swamped by the
Californians, while Gill played an
outstanding game backing up the
line.
