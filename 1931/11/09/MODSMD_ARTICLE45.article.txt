# Second Week's Play Gives Indications Of Champions

### BOB WADE 
TODAY'S SCHEDULE
El Cuadro Vs. Delta Chi, V.8.8., 3
Phi Psis vs. Sequoia I, V.8.8., 4
Phi Sigs vs. K.A., Fr.8.8., 3
Theta Xi vs. Phi Kaps, Fr.8.8., 4
Sigma Nu vs. D.U., Fr.F.B., 3
Phi Delta Phi vs. El Campo, Grays
field, 3
After two weeks of intramural
tag-football, the teams are beginning
to give the fans an idea of the prob
able league winners.
League I presents the Phi Delta
Phi outfit as the logical leader, with
the Phi Delts having the best chance
of upsetting them.
League II gives promise of de
veloping into a hot contest between
the Sigma Chis, defending intra
mural champions, and the speedy
Alpha Delts. With "Chick" Lee's
shoulder healing rapidly, and the
chance that he will be able to play
in their next contest, the challengers
will be hard to keep down.
League 111. looks like an El Toro j
win. The Kappa Sigs may be able
to trip The Bull, but he has a well
rounded attack that has bowled over
everything encountered so far.
As long as the Wardwell brothers
are in the game, the Phi Sigs seem
slated for League IV honors. These
boys haven't been stopped consist
ently yet, and they get most dan
gerous when they are behind, so
watch out for them unless the Sigma
Nus pull an upset.
League V has developed into a
two-way race between the Breakers
and the Betas. If Ketron and Co.
can stop the Phillipi family the Row
men might take the honors.
League VI seems to be a cinch
for the lead to be decided when
the high-scoring Theta Chis meet
a shifty A.T.O. outfit. The latter has
the better running attack, with
passing offenses about even.
Today's best battle appears to be

the Phi Kap-Theta Xi struggle, with
the former a slight favorite.

to trip The Bull, but he has a well
rounded attack that has bowled over
everything encountered so far.
As long as the Wardwell brothers
are in the game, the Phi Sigs seem
slated for League IV honors. These
boys haven't been stopped consist
ently yet, and they get most dan
gerous when they are behind, so
watch out for them unless the Sigma
Nus pull an upset.
League V has developed into a
two-way race between the Breakers
and the Betas. If Ketron and Co.
can stop the Phillipi family the Row
men might take the honors.
League VI seems to be a cinch
for the lead to be decided when
the high-scoring Theta Chis meet
a shifty A.T.O. outfit. The latter has
the better running attack, with
passing offenses about even.
Today's best battle appears to be

the Phi Kap-Theta Xi struggle, with
the former a slight favorite.

After two weeks of intramural
tag-football, the teams are beginning
to give the fans an idea of the prob
able league winners.
League I presents the Phi Delta
Phi outfit as the logical leader, with
the Phi Delts having the best chance
of upsetting them.
League II gives promise of de
veloping into a hot contest between
the Sigma Chis, defending intra
mural champions, and the speedy
Alpha Delts. With "Chick" Lee's
shoulder healing rapidly, and the
chance that he will be able to play
in their next contest, the challengers
will be hard to keep down.
League 111. looks like an El Toro j
win. The Kappa Sigs may be able
to trip The Bull, but he has a well
rounded attack that has bowled over
everything encountered so far.
