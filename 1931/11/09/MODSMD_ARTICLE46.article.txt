# MAN'S ARGUMENTS FOR BELIEF IN GOD NAMED IN SERMON
## 
### 
'The common man has three argu
ments for his belief in God," said
Rev. Ezra Van Nuys, of the Calvary
Presbyterian Church of San Fran
cisco, yesterday, in his sermon in
the Memorial Chu r ch.
The three arguments put forth
are: the fact that this world is in
existence, the fact that the greatest
man in all'history, Jesus Christ,
recognized God and called him
Father, and that man has always
needed faith in some higher power
in order to inspire him to greater
deeds.
