# CARD SOCCERMEN PREPARE FOR TILT WITH SAN MATEO
## Johnny Moore, Star Center Half, May Be Able To Play Tomorrow , 
### 
j With the varsity slated for a short,
! hard scrimmage against the second
| string today, and the freshmen due
| for a heavy atfernoon's work, Coach
I Har r y Maloney's soccer squad will
! iron out the kinks contracted over
the week-end in preparation for to
morrow's crucial game with San
Mateo Junior College.
Stanford already holds one de
cision this year over the Jay see
J team, but they have a tough as
! signment on their hands to make it
i two straight. San Mateo is the de-
J fending league champion, and in the
| past they have emerged with one
| victory after another over the In
! dians. ' *
Moore a Problem
Coach Maloney was still dubious
Thursday over the possibility that
his star center-half, Johnny Moore,
would be able to start the game
Tuesday against his former mates.
Both Moore and Ted Beggs, inside
i left, are former San Mateo catel
) lites, and both were largely re
! sponsible for the Redshirts' first
J victory over the Junior College
j team.
| If Maloney's men can hang up
| another scalp Tuesday, and come
; out of the fray without any injuries,
| they will be favored to take the
j league-title, providing that they are
I not upset by the Bears or S.F.U.
"Take up football to reduce," is
i the advice given the weighty women
1 of San Diego State College.
