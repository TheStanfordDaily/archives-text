# ART GALLERY HAS GRIDIRON COACHES' PAINTING EXHIBITS
## Pop Warner's Work Shows Conservatism; Zuppke Likes Sketching 
### Harry McMasters 
An "all-coach" art exhibit went
on display in the Art Gallery yes
terday with paintings by "Pop"
Warner, Coach Bob Zuppke of Illi
nois, and Coach William "Lone Star"
Dietz of Haskell Institute. The ex
hibit will remain on the walls until
November 29.
Warner's paintings are peaceful
Palo Alto landscapes and are rather
conservative, but show occasional
flashes of color. Many of Zuppke's
are hurried sketches from windows
of Santa Fe trains, which he worked
up ,later from memory.
Paints From Memory
In a letter to Pedro J. Lemos, di
rector of the Stanford Museum and
Art Gallery, Zuppke said painting
from memory is his favorite method.
In summer he paints snow scenes,
in summer landscapes with green
foliage and flowers. Lemos says he
does excellent work.
An interesting painting is a land
scape by Dietz with a tree by "Pop."
It seems they had an argument
about how the tree should be
painted. There are also two pictures
of the Bay which they did side by
side, trying to see who could finish
first.
Style of Painting
Each coach's style of painting is
like his coaching. Zuppke's and
Dietz's are characterized by dash
and bright coloring, while Warners
shows patient working over of the
same subjects in striving for perfec-
tion. "Pop" put himself through
Cornell with his water colors, and
Lemos says his work is equal to
that of many ptofessional painters.
The works of members of the Palo
Alto Art Club will also be on exhibit
until November 20. This is the club's
first display and covers a wide va
riety of subjects.
