# U.S. Infantry Moves To Halt China Riots
## Japan Will Quit League If Boycott Is Effected 
### 
TOKYO, Nov: 8. OP)—Reports
that the powers might impose a
"diplomatic boycott" in backing up
the League of Nations against Japan
were characterized in official circles
today as "diplomatic intimidation"
which has not caused Tokyo to
budge an inch from its original
stand.
It was authoritatively stated that
if the League persisted in attempt
ing to dictate concerning Manchuria,
Tokyo would be compelled to with
draw from the League.
Japan has always contended that
the Manchurian situation was an
affair concerning only Japan and
China and should be settled between
themselves. Officially Japan had not
been told by Kenkichi Yoshizawa,
its representative at Geneva, con
cerning the diplomatic boycott pro
posal, government heads having
heard of it only through press dis
patches.
As viewed here the diplomatic
boycott would amount practically
to a severence of relations with the
countries involved and cause serious
complications from every angle. In
Japan's eyes, the League is assum
ing a role of a "superstate" which
Tokyo views with greatest dissatis
faction.
