# STANFORD PAIR DEBATE TURKS HERE TONIGHT
## Bloom, Conn Experienced; Constantinople Men Making Tour STUDENTS ATTEND FREE Danger From Bolshevism, Fascism Is Topic 
### 
Stanford will put two of her most
able speakers on the debating plat
form tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall when Leonard Bloom
and Howard Conn meet A. Galib
Rifat and Suha Zeki, Turkish stu
dents of Robert College, Constan
tinople.

With still another year of debate
competition before him, Leonard
Bloom, history major from San
Francisco, has talked his way into
the front ranks of debaters on the
varsity squad. One of the outstand
ing speakers on the Lowell High
team, Bloom made an enviable rec
ord for himself in prep forensic
circles. In his freshman year at
Stanford, he qualified for the frosh
debate squad and participated in
two debates. It was during his soph
omore year that Bloom began to
round into form and make serious
bid for recognition on the varsity
team. Two debates in which he took
part were marked by his able elo
quence and reward has been given
with his position on the squad
today.
Barclay to Preside
Howard Conn is another of the
Stanford speakers with a record
which qualifies him as an outstand
ing speaker. Before his transfer from
Fresno State, Conn gained a back
ground of speaking experience by
debating in six contests on the state
forensic schedule. During his career
as a debater for Stanford, Conn has
participated in nine intercollegiate
contests. Conn is a philosophy major
of senior standing and holds the of
fice of president in Delta Sigma Rho,
Stanford chapter of the national
honorary debating fraternity.
The debate tonight, with Professor
T. S. Barclay presiding, is a no
decision affair, as the two Turkish
men are on a tour that does not per
mit their intensive concentration for
any one topic. They are debating on
five different subjects. The topic for
tonight's contest is: "Resolved: That
the world has more to fear from
Fascism than from Bolshevism."
Stanford debaters will attempt to
prove that Bolshevism is the most
dangerous to the world and uphold
Fascism in the process. The two
Turkish collegians must show the
question feasible in their affirmative
viewpoint on the issue.
Students Free
A dinner reception with the Turk
ish visitors as guests of honor will
be held prior to the debate in the
.Union dining room at 6 o'clock.
Among the guests will be Professor
J. G. Gordon, debate coach; Profes
sor T. S. Barclay, presiding officer
at the debate; Leland Chapin, as
sistant debate coach; the two Stan
ford representatives, Bloom and
Conn, and the debate manager, John
Gange, and his assistant, Wardell
Duggan.
Admission to the debate will be a
charge of fifty cents to other than
Stanford students, who may be ad
mitted upon presentation of their
student body cards.
