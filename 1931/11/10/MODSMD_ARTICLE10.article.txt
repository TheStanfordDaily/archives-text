## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9. </P)â€”Still ;
encumbered by controversy with the i
| White House, the Navy League J
broke once more into print today, j
using this time not its own words, j
but those of Calvin Coolidge.
J With Armistice Day approaching,
, the league distributed to news
papers a pamphlet reprinting in
whole the address made by the last
President on the 1928 anniversary of
the World War's ending.
Paragraph after paragraph of the
: text, calling attention to the need for
considerable naval armament, has
been printed in bold type to stand
out from the rest.
