# WARNER GIVES FOOTBALL MEN FIRST HOLIDAY
## Heavy Work For Big Game Will Not Begin Until End of Week 
### LOWELL COX 
All was quiet on the gridiron
front yesterday afternoon as Coach
Pop Warner gave the entire squad
its first week-day holiday since the
opening of the season. With only a
"breather" with Nevada scheduled
for this Saturday, heavy work for
the California game will not get
under way until the end of the
week.
Eighteen men who saw the hardest
service in the Trojan game Satur
day will not be in uniform at today's
session, but Warner will send the j
third and fourth teams through a j
full-length game in the Stadium,
with the gates open to students and
public. The kick-off is scheduled
for 4 o'clock.
Tod Definitely Out
With Tod definitely out for the
season and Moffatt a very doubtful
quantity even for the Dartmouth
game, Pop plans to shift Clark from
left to right end and Afflerbaugh
from right to left half. Both may
see service at their new posts this
afternoon.
Hardy was badly shaken up in the j
U.S.C. affair, but is expected to lake }
over Moffatt's duties at the all-im
portant left half position in the Big j
Game. Hardy, while not the equal |
of "Phancy Phil," is a sweet player,
and the shifting of Afflerbaugh will i
reinforce the position. The latter j
may extend Hardy to keep first call I
for the post.
Caddel will continue at right half,
with Lambert and Wilson as subs.
The latter two will work in this
afternoon's game. I
Subs To Be Used
Nevada offered little* opposition to
California, and Warner is expected
to use a mixture of second- and j
third-string men against the* Wolf j
Pack Saturday.
Reynolds or Wittenau will be at j
left end, with Clark at his new post
at the right wing. Gribben and Nel
son Gray will work at tackles,
Scribner and Kite at guards, and
McLeod at center, according to pres
ent indications. [
In the backfield Afflerbaugh will j
be given opportunity to acquaint j
himself with his new duties, with j
Wilson or Lambert at right half. j
Targhetta, Baker, and Jack Hillman |
are expected to work at the quar- j
terback-fullback posts.
MolTatt May Be Out
The m&n excused from practice I
tonight include Colvin, Neil 1, Doub, j
Hand, Hulen, Bigelow, Marks, Hill- i
man, Campbell, and Allen.
Moffatt, of course, is not being
counted on for the rest of the sea- 1
son. He is due back on the campus j
this morning from Los Angeles, i
where he was treated for the knee !
injury he received in running back I
the opening kickoff of the Trojan !
game. Encouraging reports have i
been received from the South re- j
garding his newest injury, but as i
only three weeks remain before the J
close of the Indian schedule, it is j
extremely doubtful if the star will i
be available for such service even
against Dartmouth.
Tod, who received a cracked j
shoulder early in the game, is not j
considered to have as much chance !
as Moffatt to get back into uniform.

Moffatt, of course, is not being
counted on for the rest of the sea- 1
son. He is due back on the campus j
this morning from Los Angeles, i
where he was treated for the knee !
injury he received in running back I
the opening kickoff of the Trojan !
game. Encouraging reports have i
been received from the South re- j
garding his newest injury, but as i
only three weeks remain before the J
close of the Indian schedule, it is j
extremely doubtful if the star will i
be available for such service even
against Dartmouth.
Tod, who received a cracked j
shoulder early in the game, is not j
considered to have as much chance !
as Moffatt to get back into uniform.
The oldest Spanish university is |
that of Salamanca, founded in 1240. '
All was quiet on the gridiron
front yesterday afternoon as Coach
Pop Warner gave the entire squad
its first week-day holiday since the
opening of the season. With only a
"breather" with Nevada scheduled
for this Saturday, heavy work for
the California game will not get
under way until the end of the
week.
Eighteen men who saw the hardest
service in the Trojan game Satur
day will not be in uniform at today's
session, but Warner will send the j
third and fourth teams through a j
full-length game in the Stadium,
with the gates open to students and
public. The kick-off is scheduled
for 4 o'clock.
Tod Definitely Out
With Tod definitely out for the
season and Moffatt a very doubtful
quantity even for the Dartmouth
game, Pop plans to shift Clark from
left to right end and Afflerbaugh
from right to left half. Both may
see service at their new posts this
afternoon.
Hardy was badly shaken up in the j
U.S.C. affair, but is expected to lake }
over Moffatt's duties at the all-im
portant left half position in the Big j
Game. Hardy, while not the equal |
of "Phancy Phil," is a sweet player,
and the shifting of Afflerbaugh will i
reinforce the position. The latter j
may extend Hardy to keep first call I
for the post.
Caddel will continue at right half,
with Lambert and Wilson as subs.
The latter two will work in this
afternoon's game. I
Subs To Be Used
Nevada offered little* opposition to
California, and Warner is expected
to use a mixture of second- and j
third-string men against the* Wolf j
Pack Saturday.
Reynolds or Wittenau will be at j
left end, with Clark at his new post
at the right wing. Gribben and Nel
son Gray will work at tackles,
Scribner and Kite at guards, and
McLeod at center, according to pres
ent indications. [
In the backfield Afflerbaugh will j
be given opportunity to acquaint j
himself with his new duties, with j
Wilson or Lambert at right half. j
Targhetta, Baker, and Jack Hillman |
are expected to work at the quar- j
terback-fullback posts.
MolTatt May Be Out
The m&n excused from practice I
tonight include Colvin, Neil 1, Doub, j
Hand, Hulen, Bigelow, Marks, Hill- i
man, Campbell, and Allen.
