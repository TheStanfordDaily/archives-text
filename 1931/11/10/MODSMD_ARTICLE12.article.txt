# CONCERT SERIES OFFICE REPORTS RETURN OF SIGN
## 
### 
It pays lo advertise! An old
gag, but balm to the Concert
Series office. The elaborate pos
ter display of Grace Moore
(designed by Berk Anthony)
which was .stolen the night of
her concert, returned Friday
morning, leaning against the
front stoop of the Series office
like a weary prodigal.
A clipping from the Daily,
telling of the theft, was pinned
to itâ€”"l'm sorry" written in
flowing, if disguised, script
across the printed story.
The only clue is offered by a
clerk in the Administration
Building who saw the poster
being carried into Encina Hall
directly after the concert.
Whether advertising pays
enough to produce the Daily's
front door sign, stolen this
week-end, is still to be dis
covered.
