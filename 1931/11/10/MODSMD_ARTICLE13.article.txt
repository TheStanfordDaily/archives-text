# INSURGENTS ASK JOBLESS RELIEF
## Three Billion Dollar Road Construction Sought 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9. (TP)—The
legislative program of the Repub
lican independents took shape today
with advocacy by Senator Norris,
of Nebraska, an independent leader,
of three billion dollars for Federal
road building to aid employment.
It is one of the first employment
measures to be advanced.
Reporting "general dissatisfaction
with President Hoover in the West,"
Norris frowned on suggestions that:
he enter the 1932 Presidential race.
But he said "any progressively in
clined man can beat Mr. Hoover in
the West."
Early conferences among the Re
publican independents are in pros
pect, but Norris said he knew of no
definite plan for reconvening the
Progressive conference which was
held here last March.
Both Norris and Senator Wheeler,
Democrat, of Montana, who returned
today from Europe, declared against
cancellation of the war debts owed
by the European nations. Each in
sisted that Europe cut down on
armaments before asking relief from
the debts.
As for immediate relief, the Ne
braskan agreed that charity was the
only answer this winter, but he op
posed the principle of this. He
would, however, have the Federal
Government pay its share in meet
ing relief.
