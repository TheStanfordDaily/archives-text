# Dirty Index Cards Mark Library's Popular Books
## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
Fingerprints that would delight a
modern criminologist serve also to
betray the Stanford rough in his
literary tastes. Favorite books of the
campus have been revealed on a
"black list" of index-cards at the
Library. That is, cards which are
renewed every two or three months
to escape obliteration from grimy,
eager hands.
These muchly-thumbed volumes
are offered by a despairing librarian,
who every quarter has to send to
the Library of Congress for new
cards, printed there by the govern
ment print-shops, besides typing
numbers of them herself.
The list is a trifle startling in its
variety. All the Alcohol cards are
dog-eared with handling, while
Arithmetic ranks in equally smudgy
popularity. Works on David Starr
Jordan come in for new cards as
often as Organic Chemistry, which
is pretty often, as the librarian de
clares.
All of Thomas Hardy becomes
limp from moistened thumbs, refer

jences on Joseph Conrad take on a |
! rapidly darkening aspect; and the !
| Arabian Nights are so popular that
I the library stocks up ahead on cards I
I for it.
Count Tolstoi bears the evidence j
j of fingers flipping. Alexander Dumas i
| and Boccaccio get a large share of
the student scrutiny. Shakespeare is
! immensely popular in the collected,
I abridged edition, equipped with
footnotes.
"The Psychology of Sex" in ten '
! volumes by Havelock Ellis gets out
! of the library's "hooscgow" so often
j (on written permits from the pro
i fessors) that it is practically at large,
j Strangely enough, Advertising man- |
uals arc much-thumbed, though the j
! University gives only a couple of !
minor courses in the subject. It is a |
satisfaction to see that Aristotle and 1
, Flato earn new cards regularly.
Further evidence of student ec
| centricityâ€”the few cards on To
i bacco get a lion's share of the i
j thumbing; and a book called "The
Student Who Smokes," by Earp, is (
i snatched out as fast as it returns.
