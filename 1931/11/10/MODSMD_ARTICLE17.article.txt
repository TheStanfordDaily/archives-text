# DEMOCRATS TANGLE IN NEW YORK OVER PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. (/P) — The
Democratic situation in New York
State rapidly is becoming the most
interesting in the Democratic na
tional picture. Out of it may come
one of three things—unity and sup
port of Governor Roosevelt for
presidential nominee, opposition
from Tammany Hall, and A1 Smith,
or the indorsement of a man from
another state.
Governor Roosevelt enjoys a great
advantage at present, but the path
ahead is paved with thorns and
bristles. The governor apparently
has eliminated Smith from the presi
dential contest by winning the issue
raised by the latter over the foresta
tion test.
But Smith still remains the most
troublesome factor confronting the
governor. With the aid of Tam
many, Smith might make it impos-

siblc for Governor Roosevelt to win.
Governor Roosevelt's friends think
otherwise. They believe the hos
tility of Tammany and Smith will
help him in other sections of the
country.
