# Gandhi Foresees Indian Crisis As Conference Fails
## Plans To Return Home On November 29 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 9 (/P), â€”Mahatma I
Gandhi decided today the round- J
table conference on Indian affairs is !
bound to fail, and announced he J
would sail for home November 29, j
ready to begin again his fight j
against British rule.
His decision means that it will be !
impossible for him to make the j
much-discussed visit to the United i
States; that, he said, is not the least J
regrettable feature about it.
"Neither the King nor Mr. Mac-
Donald nor Lord Sankey has given
me any tangible basis for hope that j
any of the Indian national demands i
will be granted," the Nationalist !
leader said.
"I feel that I'm wasting my time
here, but I'm willing to slay in Lon
don until the end of the conference,
which I expect will come in a fort
night. Then nobody can accuse me
of impatience."
He promised to make one final
attempt to reach an agreement with
the British authorities, but said he
did not expect the "miracle which
would save the conference from fail
ure."
"I am afraid there are many fiery
days ahead," he asserted, "but no I
people ever won its liberty without J
suffering. Before I leave I shall go
to the last extremity to avert the
disaster which looms ahead. If I fail
then I shall return to India with an
absolutely clear conscience."
