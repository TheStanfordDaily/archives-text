### 
fpOKYO, Nov. 9. (/Hi—Renewed rioting in Tientsin resulted yesterday in
a Japanese order that Chinese police seeking to keep order withdraw
300 yards from the Japanese concession. Chinese dispatches said tlu»
Japanese bombarded the native city because of failure of the police to
obey the order. Japanese said the order was issued because two Japanese
soldiers had been killed by stray bullets. Late last night machine Run
firing on the western edge of the city was reported.
Nanking officials said Japanese were secretly organizing "disturbances"
in North China cities, including Tientsin, as a means of proving to the
League of Nations the inability of the Nanking government to keen order.

" Meanwhile speculation was aroused
by news that Mah Chan-Shang,
! north Manchurian militarist, had is
sued a manifesto declaring war upon
Japan and calling upon China to
fight "to the last man." Nanking is
silent, but apparently not involved.

reported to have "declared war" on
Japan and to have opened actual
hostilties in northern Manchuria, is

His reported action does not com
mit the central government at Nan

fpOKYO, Nov. 9. (/Hi—Renewed rioting in Tientsin resulted yesterday in
a Japanese order that Chinese police seeking to keep order withdraw
300 yards from the Japanese concession. Chinese dispatches said tlu»
Japanese bombarded the native city because of failure of the police to
obey the order. Japanese said the order was issued because two Japanese
soldiers had been killed by stray bullets. Late last night machine Run
firing on the western edge of the city was reported.
Nanking officials said Japanese were secretly organizing "disturbances"
in North China cities, including Tientsin, as a means of proving to the
League of Nations the inability of the Nanking government to keen order.

" Meanwhile speculation was aroused
by news that Mah Chan-Shang,
! north Manchurian militarist, had is
sued a manifesto declaring war upon
Japan and calling upon China to
fight "to the last man." Nanking is
silent, but apparently not involved.

Censorship Charged
An. American newspaper in
Shanghai accused the Japanese mili
tary in Manchuria of suppressing
or altering press dispatches and
even subjecting the mails to cen
sorship.
General Mali Chan-Shan, who is
reported to have "declared war" on
Japan and to have opened actual
hostilties in northern Manchuria, is
governor of Hei Lung-Kiang proV?
ince and a leader of the Chinese
j Nationalists in Manchuria.
His reported action does not com
mit the central government at Nan
king, nor does it constitute a formal
declaration of war of that govern
ment and the government would be
responsible for his acts in Man
churia.
