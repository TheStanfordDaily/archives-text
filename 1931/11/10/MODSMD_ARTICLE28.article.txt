# FOREIGN INVADERS
## 
### 
In the first debate held on the campus with a foreign
college other than English, Howard Conn and Leonard
Rloom will represent Stanford against the invaders from
Robert College of Turkey.
Although debating is one of the most valuable activities
on the campus with regard to the benefits to the partici
pants, it does not receive the backing from the students
that it deserves.
These two men, A. Galib Rifat and Suha Zeki, touring
under the sponsorship of the National Student Federation
of America, are speakers of unusual ability and their point
of view, developed in a foreign country, should be of great
interest.
A crowded Assembly Hall tonight at 8 o'clock to wit
ness this forensic battle would be a deserving tribute to
these four debaters and would show that Stanford students
have an interest in something besides athletics.
