# MAYBE IT ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL

Those Stanford women who might have had cause to
complain about restrictions on late leaves might find some
solace in the editorial from the student newspaper at the
I Diversity of Kansas, where closing hours for women are
regulated upon a much more stringent basis than they are
on this campus.
The Daily Kansan says:
"At least one university in the country seems to have
struck upon an intelligent solution of the much discussed
question of closing hours for women.
"The Stanford disciplinary board recently announced
that closing hours should be determined on the basis of
the health and scholarship of the individual. The young
women who are able to maintain a high standard of schol
arship, and at the same time keep physically fit, will be
allowed an extra hour on week nights, and an additional
hour and a half on Saturday.
"As one reporter ably puts it, 'Those who are buxom
and bouncing, but think Cicero is a Chicago suburb, are
barred. So are those who know Latin and logarithms, but
look peaked and tired.'
"II there is lo be any discrimination between individu
als iu the mallei' of closing hours, this seems to be a most
intelligent and reasonable basis on which to make il. At
any rate, it is more sensible than the rule now in effect at
the I'niversity, whereby only the women who can inveigle
somebody into taking them to a party, are allowed late
hours.
"If discrimination is desirable, the Stanford basis may
suggest a solution to the local student governing body."
