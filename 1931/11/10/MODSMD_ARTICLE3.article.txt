concept and dramatic intensity, is a
rare example of Russian organ mu
sic. "Benediction" is a significant
interpretation in music of the desire
for peace among the nations and was
arranged by Germany's most dis

This group of musical numbers
will be followed by five minutes of
silent meditation and a benediction
given by Reverend D. Charles Gard
ner, chaplain of the Memorial
Church.
