# OUR COLLEGE MEN
## 
### 
Isn'l il nice thai I lie college magazines have found out
for us helpless "eo-eds" thai "college men prefer college
women as life companions?" We really didn't have the
least idea, before this nation-wide poll vote, that thev even
gave us a serious thought.
My, but we are relieved! Of course, it's just our idea of
heaven to start out life with our "newlv-graduatcd" hus
band on $100 a month, or less. We had never even con
sidered marrying someone who could give us what we had
been used to. or even remotely imagined that we might
have brains enough to make a success in the business
world.
Sister students, again the educated woman has come
to her own; the college man has decided he prefers her
lo anv other, for his little wife. I'liinrrsihi Daily Kansan.

All, mid strangely enough, that means all, members of
the editorial stall will assemble peacefully this afternoon
;;l I o'clock or catch hell.
