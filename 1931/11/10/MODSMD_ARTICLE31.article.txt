# BULL SESSION
## TONIGHT OR NEVER 
### 
There are some who feel that j
every calamity from the control of j
the House of Representatives by the
Democrats to a lootball defeat, is
due to the insidious workings of the
Bolsheviks. Every man with a beard
is a potential red agent ready to j
dynamite the Yankee republic clear
out of the North American contin
ent, according to certain America- i
First agencies. On the other hand :
there are many who feel that 80l- I
shevism is the antjel of mercy ready |
to lead the capitalistic world from j
the bogs of depression and the mor- j
ass of corrupted democracy. Of
course most people don't know any- |
thing about Russia and care less; ?
v/e accept their dancers and musi
cians and their vodka (if available) !
and let it go at that.
Southwest of Russia, the forces !
of revolution have changed jersies; j
have adopted a new "M" formation; |
but seem to be equally successful in ;
upsetting the old pre-war order. !
The black-shirted l'ascisti are against !
Bolshevism — against democracy —
against everything and everybody :
but Mussolini and Italy. What the j
result of this three-cornered fight i
will be is something that everybody
is interested in. Historians tell us j
that systems tend to spread and !
spreading means that two of the j
three contestants will have to be '
forced out. The Fascists, the Com- j
munists, and the rest of us all are !

I claiming to be sure which system
i will win.
The trouble is that it is very hard
| to get the dope. Every college pro
fessor who visits Russia feels that
|he is under moral obligation 1 to
; write a long, tedious, and involved
I account of what he saw and heard,
but these men rarely see the right
; things! Almost every book about
j Italy is either a glorious hymn of
| praise for II Duce or a severe and
j violent attack on the same indi
| vidual.
It is almost impossible for the
! average student with football games
I and week-ends, and glorious after
j noons and classes as well, to study
the situation with which every in
i telligent person today should be
1 well acquainted. But there is a way,
! and even if it doesn't come wrapped
I in cellophane, it is sure to be fresh
[ and free from dust or other irri
{ tating substances. Tonight Stanford
i meets the Turkish debaters on just
this question—the relative danger of
j Fascism and Bolshevism. At the
usual hour for such things in the
; place, the Stanford Assembly
i Hall, the "Terrible Turks" will meet
j the "Cunning Cards" in what prom
| ises to be not only an instructive
evening but plenty hot as well, as
! the question is so worded as to pre
vent the quibbling over terms which
, debaters are said, and with some
j truth, to enjoy above all else.

There are some who feel that j

the House of Representatives by the

dynamite the Yankee republic clear
out of the North American contin

there are many who feel that 80l- I

to lead the capitalistic world from j
the bogs of depression and the mor- j
ass of corrupted democracy. Of
