PIOTILETKA: RUSSIA'S FIVE
YEAR PLAN—By Michael Farb
man. New Republic Series.
To the distant onlooker, Russian
affairs appear in a confusingly un
certain light. The interested average
man runs into all varieties of opinion
on the subject through newspapers
and magazines. His brain, puzzled to
understand the true state of affairs,
pictures either a peaceful Utopia or
a miserable failure with its attend
ant widespread suffering.
In this short volume Farbman
summarizes the Russian Five-year
Plan as he has seen it at first, hand,
with special reference to the year
1930 and its accomplishments. Cer
tain economic principles involved
are explained clearly, some of Rus
sia's obstacles enumerated, and
Stalin's forceful methods described
in a favorable light.
One may read many a "My Im
pressions of Russia," and still be the
gainer only of a one-sided view, but
Farbman is generally acknowledged
as an unbiased observer of the in
dustrial, agricultural, and social

| conditions of Russia under the great
Five-year experiment. —R.V.W.
