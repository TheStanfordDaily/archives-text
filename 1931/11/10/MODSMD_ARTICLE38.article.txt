Writing this stuff
Is very bad
Nothing to say and
None to be had
Groan and wrench
From foot to brain
Pray to Allah,
Ra, Azerbajain
Grit and grovel,
We can't ad lib
Sigh and cry
For one contrib
Of course that's not •
The way it's done
It comes out smooth
Like rivers run
And Hie office cat asks if the
string of students applying for
tuition notes is a college bred
line.
The pedestrian's remedy—yeast,
for that run-down feeling.
Tooth paste ad.:
MUST WE THREATEN YOU
WITH PERIDONICLASIA?
We're already paying alimony.
And then there was the shys
ter lawyer who wrote all his
love letters in sand.
