# Undefeated Soccer Varsity Expects Tough Game Today
## CARD BOOTERS TO MEET SAN MATEO IN SECOND TANGLE League Championship Of Soccer Teams May Be Decided Today 
### 
Whether or not Harry Maloney's
soccer varsity will be able to lay
claim to a league championship may
be decided 011 the local field today
when the Indians tangle with the
San Mateo Bulldogs at 4 o'clock.
Although defeated by the Cards
in their first encounter, San Mateo
is unquestionably ope of the strong
est teams potentially in the league.
If there was ever any doubt about
this point it was conclusively settled
last Saturday when the Bulldogs
handed the California varsity a 2-.L
defeat.
The Redshirts' stock took a definite
rise yesterday with the return to
the lineup ol Johnny Moore, first
string center half. Both the offense
and the defense resolve for the most
part around the former San Matean,
and his absence from the lineup
would have been a : serious blow to
the Red Machine's chances.
Stanford will have to exhibit a
sterling defense as well as offense,
for the Bulldogs combine a fast
passing game with a powerful long
range attack. Farm soccer fans will
recall, however, how efficiently
Messers Webster, Holmes, and Brek
elbaum handled the suburbanites'
attempts at goal in their last en
counter.
If the varsity works today as it
did yesterday, when it beat the
second and third strings in succes
sion with comparative ease, the
chances are that the championship
gonfalon will spend the winter on
the Farm.
The main thing that Captain
Falk's men. have lacked all season
is a strong offense, and for the last
week Coach Maloney has been drill
ing the boys on a fast, short-passing
game that will draw the opposing
fullbacks out of position and permit
the forwards a clear shot at goal.
With Moore in there to feed the ball
to the forward-line there is no rea
son why Stanford shouldn't send the
visitors home on the blank end of a
good healthy score, but it takes more
than good defensive playing to beat
San Mateo.
The Bulldogs won't be beaten by
Ihe same tactics that conquered the
Berkeley Bears. They have an at
tack that is built around a number
of men, not just one or two.
