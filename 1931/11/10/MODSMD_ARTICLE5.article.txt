MANILA, Nov. 9. (/P) â€”Prevailing
opinion in Washington, President
Manuel L. Quezon of the Insular
Senate today told a joint session of
the Philippine Legislature, is that
should the question be put to Con
gress, "there would be a very large
majority in favor of Philippine in
dependence."
Senator Quezon warned his hear
ers, however, that the battle for in
dependence was not yet won, and
expressed fears lest the vote in the
forthcoming session be blocked.
