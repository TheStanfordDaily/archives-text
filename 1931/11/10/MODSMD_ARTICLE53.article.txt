# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### 
A CERTAIN SCHOOL over across
the bay is looking forward to th#
first Saturday before Thanksgiving
with more glee than for quite some
time. And with reason.
California, by comparative
scores, is 13 points better than
Stanford. The Bears held South
ern California to 13 less points
than did the Indians, and
downed Washington, 13 to 0,
while the best the Farm team
could do was a scoreless tic.
Even on the basis of Olympic
Club games, played earlier in .
the season, (he Bears arc a
touchdown better.

i NOW COMPARATIVE scores
! prove little or nothing, especially
j when a single team is used as a
| basis. But certainly Stanford can
i find little encouragement in the fact
! that the Berkeley eleven has CON
| SISTENTLY made better showings
j against common opponents.
I Of course it must be taken into
! consideration that Stanford had to
' travel to Seattle to meet the Hus
! kies, and played Ihem in a driving
rain, while the Bears faced them at
i Berkeley.

1 gives Stanford a "good chance''
against the Bears, but isn't
I "sure."
"I think thai Stanford has a
good chance of beating Califor
nia." said the Trojan head man,

] "but I am not sure. I am not sure
of anything in football."

STANFORD HOPES for a victory
j lie principally in past performances,
J and the fact that U.S.C. consistently
! foxed the Bears with typical Warner
j reverses.
The Indians always play their best
1 late in the season, as the Califor
i nians have discovered to their sor
j row ever since 1924. But this year,
! under Bill Ingram, the Bears have
; looked better every start, ( and will
i themselves be at the height of their
| game on the twenty-first.
A California weakness against
reverses was shown in their
game with Southern California,
when the Trojans scored their
lone touchdown on a typical
Warner play, and never failed
to gain when using reverses.
That, at least, seems to favor
j Stanford.

| THE FAILURE of the Indian
; passing attack in the Southern Cali
i fornia game Saturday was the big
! gest disappointment of the day.
j "Dusty" Allen, apparently nervous,
! didn't have his eye, and Rintala was
| no better. Long passes were either
i too short or were out of reach of
j the receivers. Short passes didn't
I work at all.
Another factor in preventing
the aerial attack from working
j was the Trojan defense tactics.
Stanford ends were delayed in
getting down under passes that
1 they might otherwise have

'
reached. It didn't help any to
have had to show Jones that
Allen-to-Colvin pass in the
U.C.L.A. contest. â€” L.M.C.
