# INTRAMURAL RUN IS SCHEDULED AS SATURDAY EVENT
## 
### 
The annual intramural cross
| country run—Fall track's gift to all
: aspiring and perspiring distance men
i who have not won their major let
! ters at Stanford or at any other col
! lege—will be held this Saturday at
j 1:15 o'clock. The race will start and
j finish in the stadium, and early cash
| customers at the Stanford-Nevada
j football game will be able to see the
| leaders as they stagger in.
Since '34 numeral winners also
J will be ineligible to compete, Art
1 Azevedo, last year's victor in this
j classic, will not run. Azevedo cov
| ered the 4.8 mile course in 26 min
! utes and 56 seconds to set a new
I record last fall, and will be able to
! defend his mark only by remote
j control. ■
j The entries for the event are to
i be made by organizations, although
; unattached runners may also race.
| Teams are to consist of three men
: each, and fraternities and clubs must
j post their lists by Wednesday on
the track board in Encina gym. All
i men must undergo a physical ex-
I amination.
