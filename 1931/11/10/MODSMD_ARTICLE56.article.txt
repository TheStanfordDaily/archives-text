# Bear Frosh Game Ends Babe Season
## 
### 
After completing their season with i
a great stand against the Golden
: Bear Cub.s, in which they held the
Berkeley team to a meagre 7 to (i
| victory, the Stanford freshman foot
| ball squad will take a rest this week
j to catch up on their studies. For the
remainder of the season they will
j work out three times a week,
j Coach Jimmy Bradshaw and his
! assistant, Walt Heinecke, were
i pleased with the showing of their ,
! men Saturday, and they declared ;
that practically every man played
his best game of the season,
i In reviewing the game it is ap
parent that the Californians must
i have been carrying a crop of rab
bits' feet. Both of those passes which
netted 41 yards for the Blue and
I Gold and paved the way for the
I touchdown, were good by the nar
; rowist of margins. Meek batted the
| first down with one hand and played
I juggling tricks 'with it for ten yards
before he had it firmly. As for the
j other, Moeller pulled a Colvin and
took the ball right out of two Stan
: ford men's hands.
On the other hand, Stanford lost
; a golden opportunity on the first
play of the game, which was missed
i by a good number of spectators that
I arrived'late. It was the old dead

, man play, with Butts laying out. He
was far in the clear with an open
: field before him, but Seaver's pass
went high over the outside line into
the players' bench.
Following is the .season record for
the babes:
