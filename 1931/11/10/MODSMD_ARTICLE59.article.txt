# STRONG EXPLAINS AGE PSYCHOLOGY IN RECENT STUDY
## Carnegie Foundation Aids Statistical Probe Of Over 2,000 Men 
### 
Establishing a new high record
for computations, "Changes of In
terests with Age," by Dr. Edward
K. Strong, Jr., professor of psychol
ogy here, published recently by the
Stanford University Press, was
based on examinations of more than
two thousand men between the ages
of twenty and sixty representing
eight occupations.
The research for this volume, it
was revealed by Professor Strong,
who is also chairman of the Voca
tional Guidance Committee at Stan
ford, extended over several years
under a sub-grant which the Car
negie Foundation gave to Stanford
"for the study of the psychology of
later maturity."
Still far from completed millions
of computations were necessary to
establish the facts such as: Differ
ences between 30-45-year-old men
are less than differences in interests
between mechanical and electrical
engineers, who have a very high
correlation;
Older men like doing daring
things, walking near the edge of
precipices, eating rarebits before
going to bed and such less than
younger ones;
Liking for occupations decreases
with age;
Older people arc more positive in
their likes and dislikes than younger
ones;
And some men of forty and over
can adjust themselves to the job as
well as any young whippersnap. And
so on.
Consisting mostly of elaborate
statistical treatment in support of
the findings, it is believed that this
book will add another stone to the
road now being paved by psycho
logical experimentsâ€”the goal being
to show where every man and
woman could best be fitted in the
scheme of things.
