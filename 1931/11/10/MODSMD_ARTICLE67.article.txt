# COURSE IN WORK OF GIRL ADVISERS TO BE GIVEN HERE
## Class Presented Before During Summer Quarters 
### 
For the first time, Education 236,
a course in the "Problems and Pro
cedure for Deans and Advisers of
Girls," will be offered outside of the
summer quarter, making it possible
for regular students to take it.

In summer quarter this course is
designed for experienced teachers,
administrators, deans, and advisers
of girls, and for graduate students
who expect to take up work as deans
or advisers of girls. Winter quarter
seniors who are interested in teach
ing or in other types of work with
girls may enroll if the instructor
feels that they have the necessary
background.
Miss Anastasia Doyle, director of
Roble Hall, is to offer the course.
She received her master's degree for
work in this field at Columbia Uni
versity, which institution is far in
advance of other colleges in this
country in giving such training.
The class will meet winter quarter
at 1 o'clock on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.
