The large room of the women's
gymnasium and the patio are being
decorated according to this motif by
Carl Cartwright, it was announced

draped roof, characterizations along
the walls of Spanish figures going to

features being arranged.

The 12 - piece orchestra of Hal
Girvin has been engaged to furnish
the music, it was stated by Les
