# TURK-CARDINAL FORENSIC DUEL ENDS IN DRAW
## Rifat, Zeki Give Arguments In Brilliant Oratorical Style Of Debate INDIAN DEFENSE GOOD Visitors Condemn Fascism As Too Communistic 
### 
The Bolshevists and the Fascists
met, battled, and parted on the As
sembly Hall stage last night, and
the result was a draw.
A. Galib Rifat and Suha Zeki, ihe
debaters from Robert College in
Turkey who supported Bolshevism
as less dangerous than Fascism, pre
sented a series of excellent argu
ments in brilliant fashion, colorful
because of the local interpretations
used, and characterized by beauti
ful, flowing oratory.
Defense Stands
Excellent as they were, they were
unable to break down the stout de
fense put up by Leonard Bloom and
Howard Conn for Stanford, who
scored heavily when they succeeded
in luring Rifat into a carefully laid
trap on the question of Fascism as a
"breeder of Communism." Rebuttals
and counter-rebuttals on this point
formed the most hotly contested part
of the debate.
Fascism as the underdog of the
two doctrines because the '"instinc
tive reaction against Communism
makes it appeal to the proletariat
alone," was the gist of argument
presented by Rifat in the opening
speech. The "cynical sleekness of
Fascism and the posilion of Mus
solini in his apparent 'on-the-fence'
attitude toward religion and the
church, coupled with the 'sword
rattling' tactics of the Fascisti, make
it an issue to be feared as a menace
to world peace," contended Rifat.
Objects Contrasted
A "violence to preserve" as the
main view of the Fascists, as con
trasted with a "violence to destroy"'
as the Bolshevistic outlook, makes
the former a doctrine of "means,
not an end, as is Bolshevism, to
facilitating instability and social dis
integration as the least of the two
evils to be feared," was the alterca
tion raised by Howard Conn in his
survey of the two programs.
"A nation ruled by swelled heads
with an iron hand should cause
consternation to the governments of
other countries," was the analysis
offered by Suha Zcki. He continued,
Fascism is suicide and murder com
bined, for, placing sole power in the
hands of an individual human who
boasts of his own capabilities and
who forces his adamantine will in
a schedule of legalized murder and
destructive forcefulness, it becomes
prey to the human element of self
asseftion regardless of consequence."
Mussolini Scored
"Mussolini has never been pointed
out to me as a sequel to the Goddess
of Liberty," was Leonard Bloom's
opening thrust, aiming at the claim
of his rivals of Mussolini's powt'r.
"At least the Fascists do not attempt
machinization of humans and their
ideals of religious and social liber
ties."
An audience of 500 heard the ar
guments propounded with elements
of humor. Professor Thomas Barclay
presided and introduced speakers.

presented by Rifat in the opening
speech. The "cynical sleekness of
Fascism and the posilion of Mus
solini in his apparent 'on-the-fence'
attitude toward religion and the
church, coupled with the 'sword
rattling' tactics of the Fascisti, make
it an issue to be feared as a menace
to world peace," contended Rifat.
Objects Contrasted
A "violence to preserve" as the
main view of the Fascists, as con
trasted with a "violence to destroy"'
as the Bolshevistic outlook, makes
the former a doctrine of "means,
not an end, as is Bolshevism, to
facilitating instability and social dis
integration as the least of the two
evils to be feared," was the alterca
tion raised by Howard Conn in his
survey of the two programs.
"A nation ruled by swelled heads
with an iron hand should cause
consternation to the governments of
other countries," was the analysis
offered by Suha Zcki. He continued,
Fascism is suicide and murder com
bined, for, placing sole power in the
hands of an individual human who
boasts of his own capabilities and
who forces his adamantine will in
a schedule of legalized murder and
destructive forcefulness, it becomes
prey to the human element of self
asseftion regardless of consequence."
Mussolini Scored
"Mussolini has never been pointed
out to me as a sequel to the Goddess
of Liberty," was Leonard Bloom's
opening thrust, aiming at the claim
of his rivals of Mussolini's powt'r.
"At least the Fascists do not attempt
machinization of humans and their
ideals of religious and social liber
ties."
An audience of 500 heard the ar
guments propounded with elements
of humor. Professor Thomas Barclay
presided and introduced speakers.
The Bolshevists and the Fascists
met, battled, and parted on the As
sembly Hall stage last night, and
the result was a draw.
A. Galib Rifat and Suha Zeki, ihe
debaters from Robert College in
Turkey who supported Bolshevism
as less dangerous than Fascism, pre
sented a series of excellent argu
ments in brilliant fashion, colorful
because of the local interpretations
used, and characterized by beauti
ful, flowing oratory.
Defense Stands
Excellent as they were, they were
unable to break down the stout de
fense put up by Leonard Bloom and
Howard Conn for Stanford, who
scored heavily when they succeeded
in luring Rifat into a carefully laid
trap on the question of Fascism as a
"breeder of Communism." Rebuttals
and counter-rebuttals on this point
formed the most hotly contested part
of the debate.
Fascism as the underdog of the
two doctrines because the '"instinc
tive reaction against Communism
makes it appeal to the proletariat
alone," was the gist of argument
presented by Rifat in the opening
speech. The "cynical sleekness of
Fascism and the posilion of Mus
solini in his apparent 'on-the-fence'
attitude toward religion and the
church, coupled with the 'sword
rattling' tactics of the Fascisti, make
it an issue to be feared as a menace
to world peace," contended Rifat.
