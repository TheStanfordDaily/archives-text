# HELVENSTON PICKS SKITS FOR GAIETIES
## 'Sold Short,' The Season's. Greetings' To Provide Plenty Of Laughs 
### 
Excellent material coupled with i
!an enthusiastic turnout last night 1
in the Little Theater indicated a ;
very successful 1931 Ram's Head ;
Gaieties. Last night was the first j
1 complete rehearsal and the deadline |
| for original sketches.
"Sold Short," a clever timely 1
sketch by Don Churchill Cameron,
who, with Paul Lorton, wrote "Pro- j
letariat Plus," last year's Junior
Opera, and "The Season's Greet
! ings," a very modern treatment of j
j a funny situation, by Bob Cathcart .
| were accepted by Harold Helven- j
: ston, who is in charge of the pro- i
i duction. These two sketches prom- 1
ise plenty of interesting entertain- !
. ment, and will mark high points in
[ the evening's performance.
Much Work to Be Done
All the sketches presented last j
i night were done in the "rough" and |
i considerable work on them will still j
jbe necessary before they can be I
j shown.
Some of the funnier moments on j
I the program, as in years past, will j
i be the monologues that are still in !
j preparation. Helvenston is planning j
j to have them cleverer and more sa- ;
tirical than ever before.
Another interesting event on the 1
program will be an eccentric dance j
presented by Bernhard Springer, ;
; German student attending Stanford. |
Springer is exceptionally versatile j
and has had a great deal of experi- i
; ence with this sort of thing. His in- !
I terpretations will undoubtedly add i
Ito the professional finish of the :
i show.
Other Sketches Accepted
Other sketches by Gordon Steed- I
' man, Tom Pockman and Waldo Salt |
j have been accepted, and rehearsals
will start on them immediately.
The technique of the chorus is 1
improving steadily under the expert
direction of Terry Brickley, dance
director. A full rehearsal of all
I dancing choruses is called for to-
I night at 7 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall. The complete list of chorines
; has not yet been anounced.
As usual, the Gaieties will be held
; on the Friday night before the Big
I Game, November 20.

in the Little Theater indicated a ;
very successful 1931 Ram's Head ;
Gaieties. Last night was the first j
1 complete rehearsal and the deadline |
| for original sketches.
"Sold Short," a clever timely 1
sketch by Don Churchill Cameron,
who, with Paul Lorton, wrote "Pro- j
letariat Plus," last year's Junior
Opera, and "The Season's Greet
! ings," a very modern treatment of j
j a funny situation, by Bob Cathcart .
| were accepted by Harold Helven- j
: ston, who is in charge of the pro- i
i duction. These two sketches prom- 1
ise plenty of interesting entertain- !
. ment, and will mark high points in
[ the evening's performance.
Much Work to Be Done
All the sketches presented last j
i night were done in the "rough" and |
i considerable work on them will still j
jbe necessary before they can be I
j shown.
Some of the funnier moments on j
I the program, as in years past, will j
i be the monologues that are still in !
j preparation. Helvenston is planning j
j to have them cleverer and more sa- ;
tirical than ever before.
Another interesting event on the 1
program will be an eccentric dance j
presented by Bernhard Springer, ;
; German student attending Stanford. |
Springer is exceptionally versatile j
and has had a great deal of experi- i
; ence with this sort of thing. His in- !
I terpretations will undoubtedly add i
Ito the professional finish of the :
i show.
Other Sketches Accepted
Other sketches by Gordon Steed- I
' man, Tom Pockman and Waldo Salt |
j have been accepted, and rehearsals
will start on them immediately.
The technique of the chorus is 1
improving steadily under the expert
direction of Terry Brickley, dance
director. A full rehearsal of all
I dancing choruses is called for to-
I night at 7 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall. The complete list of chorines
; has not yet been anounced.
As usual, the Gaieties will be held
; on the Friday night before the Big
I Game, November 20.
