# Live Bear Cub To Appear At Big Game Rally
## Ancil Robertson, '00, Sends Pet For Celebration 
### 
Bringing the cheering news to the |
i Rally Committee that last week's J
j Horse Rally may not have been al- i
i together in vain, the offer of a real, j
| honest-to-goodness bear for the Big j
! Game celebration next Wednesday
' night was received yesterday by Ed j
i Boyles, committee chairman.
The offer, a very generous one,
I came in a letter from Ancil Rob
j ertson, class of '00, who is now ap
| parently one of the chief citizens of
; the tiny town of Sawyers Bar, 'way
back in the "nawth woods" of this
, state. The letter follows:
Sawyers Bar
Siskiyou Co., Cal.
j Dear Mr. Boyles:
I lam a member of the class of '00.
1 have just read an account in the
i S.F. papers of your now famous
] "Horse Rally." I have always been
a fancier of animals and think it
nould be a good idea for you to
I have a real bear at your Big Game !
1 rally.
I have had for some months a
bear cub which is growing up and
j is quite a problem. I will send this j
bear to you at my expense with full j
instructions as to the feeding of the |
cub, Bozo by name. I hope you will j
be kind enough to exhibit Bozo at '
your Big Game rally, if you have j
one.
I hope, too, now that you have the !
real Axe you will hit a real Bear I
"right in the neck" with that axe |
and feed the meat to Pop Warner's '
boys to make them doubly fero- !
cious. |
I feel sure that if you accept my
request you will have no difficulty
getting Bozo off the stage and he
will cause you no other embarrass
i ment.
I
Very truly yours,
Ancil Robertson, '00
"I have sent a telegram to Mr. j
Robertson thanking him for his offer I
and telling him to send Bozo along j
in time for the Rally," Boyles de- j
1 dared last night.
