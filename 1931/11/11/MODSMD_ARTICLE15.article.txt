# Turkish Debaters Like Native Cigarettes Best

"Damn right." I
A hearty second came thundering I
from the bathroom where Suha Zeki j
was shaving in preparation for the
debate meeting of Stanford and
Robert College, Turkey. His part- j
ner, A. Galib Rifat, had just stated j
the superiority of Turkish cigarettes |
over those smoked by Americans
and with that zealous backing, there ;
couldn't have been any doubt left j
in the minds of hearers. Of course !
women smoke in Turkey. Rifat re- ,
marked, "They don't, what do you
call it, 'hit the weed' like American
girls I have seen, however."
Sixty-eight years of existence has
made Robert College the leading
men's university east of Vienna.
Some 1000 students, of which over
300 arc in the four years of college j
work, make up a student body of
many nations, not as powerful as ,
American student organizations go,
but nevertheless, a student body.
Tuition, $80 a year, or about $170
U.S. purchasing power, is considered
unusually high there and prohibits
all but the wealthiest Turkish fami
lies from sending their boys to col- !
lege. Abo'ut $250 for all expenses, in
cluding room and board, is the rate
for those living on the campus. The |
college grants a B.A. degree that is '
recognized by many leading uni
versities in this country.
Constantinople College, located a
mile from the Robert campus, is the
"better half" of the two, and from |
here come tho "dates" for the men.
A "date" is somelhinu besides a

"staple food'' even in Turkey. Social
activities are carried on collectively
between the two schools, and fre
quent dances, with plenty of chape
rones, are held.
"American football? Not my idea
of living. We play soccer, and#al
though we probably don't get the
'fun' you fellows do, we make it
interesting." Rifat was a player on
the college team in association foot
ball and has watched American
games.
Turkey has its unemployment
problems as well as other countries,
but there it isn't so easy to spar
for time by going back to college.
Men walk the streets in the same
world-wide manner, and breadlines
have their share ol publicity in the
newspapers, too.
"Speaking of newspapers," said
Rifat, "our college has a weekly
paper that has its place on the cam
pus. We don't have to depend on
advertisements, though, as costs arc
relatively lower. We also have an
annual."
Classes are unusually strong, and
many arc the frosh-soph battles.
"Strenuous battles and mud-fights
are not out of the ordinary and lots
of times the engineers band together
and raid the School of Ats. Then a
royal battle and most of the 'Arts'
are thrown in the lake," said Rifat.
Again from the bathroom, where
shoes are being brushed and tie and
hair straightened, came the thunder
ous voice of Zeki. "Oh, yeah?" For
Zeki is an "Arts" major.

Robert College, Turkey. His part- j
ner, A. Galib Rifat, had just stated j
the superiority of Turkish cigarettes |
over those smoked by Americans
and with that zealous backing, there ;
couldn't have been any doubt left j
in the minds of hearers. Of course !
women smoke in Turkey. Rifat re- ,
marked, "They don't, what do you
call it, 'hit the weed' like American
girls I have seen, however."
Sixty-eight years of existence has
made Robert College the leading
men's university east of Vienna.
Some 1000 students, of which over
300 arc in the four years of college j
work, make up a student body of
many nations, not as powerful as ,
American student organizations go,
but nevertheless, a student body.
Tuition, $80 a year, or about $170
U.S. purchasing power, is considered
unusually high there and prohibits
all but the wealthiest Turkish fami
lies from sending their boys to col- !
lege. Abo'ut $250 for all expenses, in
cluding room and board, is the rate
for those living on the campus. The |
college grants a B.A. degree that is '
recognized by many leading uni
versities in this country.
Constantinople College, located a
mile from the Robert campus, is the
"better half" of the two, and from |
here come tho "dates" for the men.
A "date" is somelhinu besides a

"staple food'' even in Turkey. Social
activities are carried on collectively
between the two schools, and fre
quent dances, with plenty of chape
rones, are held.
"American football? Not my idea
of living. We play soccer, and#al
though we probably don't get the
'fun' you fellows do, we make it
interesting." Rifat was a player on
the college team in association foot
ball and has watched American
games.
Turkey has its unemployment
problems as well as other countries,
but there it isn't so easy to spar
for time by going back to college.
Men walk the streets in the same
world-wide manner, and breadlines
have their share ol publicity in the
newspapers, too.
"Speaking of newspapers," said
Rifat, "our college has a weekly
paper that has its place on the cam
pus. We don't have to depend on
advertisements, though, as costs arc
relatively lower. We also have an
annual."
Classes are unusually strong, and
many arc the frosh-soph battles.
"Strenuous battles and mud-fights
are not out of the ordinary and lots
of times the engineers band together
and raid the School of Ats. Then a
royal battle and most of the 'Arts'
are thrown in the lake," said Rifat.
Again from the bathroom, where
shoes are being brushed and tie and
hair straightened, came the thunder
ous voice of Zeki. "Oh, yeah?" For
Zeki is an "Arts" major.
"Damn right." I
