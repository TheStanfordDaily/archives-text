# Odds For Big Game Swing On Condition Of Moffatt, Hillman
## "Phantom Phil" Probably Out For Good, But Captain Harry May Get Inâ€”Warner Grooms Baker, Afflerbaugh, Targhetta For Jobs 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
, WITH Phil MofTatt hack on the campus and displaying a pronounced
limp, while Captain Harry Hillman lies in the hospital with an injured
hip, the establishment of a favorite in the forthcoming Big Game will
hinge on their physical condition November 21. Neither is definitely out
of the classic with California, but the scales balance in favor of Hillman's
and against MolTatt's playing on that date.
In the meantime, Coach Warner is grooming flashy Kenny AfTlerbaugh
to bolster the left half position, which is at present filled by Spud Hardy.
Tommy Glover, another left half with promise, is still on the ailing list.

Should Hillman be forced out of
play against the Blue and Gold,
there remain to assume his duties,
Baker and Targhetta, two men
whose forte is backing up the line.
Both lack the strong offensive drive
of Hillman, however.
Subs Scrimmage
Meanwhile, in preparation for this
Saturday's game with Little Nevada,
Warner is combing through his stock
of reserves to select a starting team.
Last night the complete squad, with
the exception of 18 men who saw
extensive, hard service against
U.S.C., played an informal game.
The contest was of an hour's dura
tion and was won by the gray
shirted team when Jack Hillman
plunged over from the nine-yard
line for the only score of the after
noon. .
The affair was rather ragged
throughout, with both lines leaking
badly on defense. Hancock got away
some nice punts for the red-shirted
team, and both sides used effective
ly the sort pass behind the line of
scrimmage.
J. Hillman Scores
The Stadium bowl was getting
darker than a tunnel when the gray
shirts finally started a successful
drive from midfield. From a punt
formation, Bob Maentz slipped down
the sideline to the redshirt's 35-yard
mark. His effort was followed by the
short pass play with Lambert gal
loping around right end to the 15-
yard mark. In a series of short
bucks, Targhetta and Jack Hillman
turned on the steam, and with a
powerful drive he cut through over
the goal line.
The scrimmage was hard enough
to injure two men. Hunt and Clark
were both smashed up coming down
on a punt, but neither is seriously
hurt. Clark was having his first
workout at right end, where he has
been shifted to add strength.
Gray Shirts Good
The gray-shirted backfield ap
peared to work with smoothness and
harmony. Maentz and Lambert at
halves, Targhetta at quarter, and
Jack Hillman at fullback composed
this unit. Opposing them were
Campbell and Wilson at halves, with
Gabriel and Hancock as the full
and quarterback team.
Kenny Afflerbaugh was scheduled
to appear at his new position at left
half, but the fleet-footed Cardinal
was not in uniform.
