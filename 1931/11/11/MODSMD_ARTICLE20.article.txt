# KITTEN DEPARTS DAILY OFFICE TO SERVE HUMANITY
## 
### 
The office cat lias come to
naught;
Abroad no more is he;
For in his innards they
have sought—
Those students of ana
tomy.
It was really only one of the
many Daily office cats that met
the sad, sad fate hinted at in
the above poetry. All of them—
yes, all six of them —were pets
of Ye Feature Ed, and great
was her sorrow when the six
became five.
Rumor has it that a zealous
bone-chopper from the ana
tomy lab, more courageous than
his fellows, walked off with the
unfortunate feline the other
night, and that great were the
indignities thai were committed
upon his (the cat's) late pei\son.
What with an honest thief re
turning the concert series pos
ter, and a still fondled hope
that the Daily will get its sign
back, Ye Feature Ed still dares
to hope to see protege No. 6
again. But the rest of the staff
has no desire to be haunted by
a cat with' red-inked arteries,
blue-inked veins, and carrying
its hide behind.
