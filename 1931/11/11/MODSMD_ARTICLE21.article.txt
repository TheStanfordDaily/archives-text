# DRIVE STARTED BY RED CROSS
## Chairman Urges Students To Give Support 
### 
Starting the Red Cross member
ship drive today, Mrs. Bailey Willis,
| chairman of the campus committee,
I urges all Stanford students to en
! roll in this national relief campaign.
"It is the duty of students as well
jas other citizens to shoulder re
| sponsibility in the present national
I unemployment emergency by sup
| porting the Red Cross, America's
premier relief organization," stated
! Mrs. Willis.
Calling for full student enrollment
i in the Red Cross, Dean Mary Yost
jsaid yesterday, "The Red Cross roll
; call offers each one of us the op
i portunity to play the part of citizen
and neighbor. Half of the $1 mem
bership fee goes to the national
fund and one-half to local relief.
Need Greater This Year
"In ordinary years the work of
! the Red Cross is indispensable. In
' this year the need for it is even
! greater than usual. We, in our com
; paratively sheltered and comfort
! able surroundings, should take this
j opportunity to do even a small part
! in helping those less fortunate. No
I student in the University should
i withhold his or her dollar. If there
j is sacrifice involved in making this
j gift, this sacrifice should be made.
"The Roll Call should be 100 per
i cent, and I am sure that it will reach
j that goal. The work among the
women has started in a splendid
' way. Each member of the commit
| tee has accepted with eagerness the
: opportunity to do the work."

Starting the Red Cross member
ship drive today, Mrs. Bailey Willis,
| chairman of the campus committee,
I urges all Stanford students to en
! roll in this national relief campaign.
"It is the duty of students as well
jas other citizens to shoulder re
| sponsibility in the present national
I unemployment emergency by sup
| porting the Red Cross, America's
premier relief organization," stated
! Mrs. Willis.
Calling for full student enrollment
i in the Red Cross, Dean Mary Yost
jsaid yesterday, "The Red Cross roll
; call offers each one of us the op
i portunity to play the part of citizen
and neighbor. Half of the $1 mem
bership fee goes to the national
fund and one-half to local relief.
Need Greater This Year
"In ordinary years the work of
! the Red Cross is indispensable. In
' this year the need for it is even
! greater than usual. We, in our com
; paratively sheltered and comfort
! able surroundings, should take this
j opportunity to do even a small part
! in helping those less fortunate. No
I student in the University should
i withhold his or her dollar. If there
j is sacrifice involved in making this
j gift, this sacrifice should be made.
"The Roll Call should be 100 per
i cent, and I am sure that it will reach
j that goal. The work among the
women has started in a splendid
' way. Each member of the commit
| tee has accepted with eagerness the
: opportunity to do the work."
