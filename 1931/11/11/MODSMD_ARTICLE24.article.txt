# COACH EXPECTS OLYMPIC GAME TRYOUTS HERE
## Track And Field Committee To Vote On Location Of Meet Sunday MALONEY WILL ATTEND I.C.4-A. Meet Next Year May Also Be Held Here 
### 
Belief that Stanford will be
| awarded the Olympic Game tryouts
for track and field events was ex
; pressed by Harry Maloney, minor
I sports coach, here yesterday.
Maloney is leaving tonight for
; Kansas City, Missouri, to attend the
j meeting of the Olympic Games
Track and Field Committee, com
posed of 15* selected mentors from
various sections of the United
States, to be held in ihe Kansas City
Athletic Club Sunday. The matter
will come up at this time, when a
final decision as to the location of
the tryouts will be made, Stanford's
| Minor Sports director said.
Superior Facilities
Maloney, a recognized authority
| on rugby and soccer, revealed that
! he had received this week a letter
from Joseph E. England, chairman
! of the committee, asking him to be
present at Sunday's meeting. In of
fering the use of Stanford's stadium
and gymnasiums, it will be pointed
out that the facilities available at
Stanford are the best in the country
, for this purpose.
I Coach Maloney says: "Stanford is
so situated that it is far enough
. from Los Angeles so that those peo
ple intending to attend the Olympic
i Games there will not see the try
outs in advance of the track and
field meet in that city, and far
| enough from San Francisco to lend
j a real country atmosphere. Trans
portation facilities are excellent
j both by auto and train, and visitors
j will have easy access' to the cam
! pus."
Location Not Definite
, Contrary to printed announce
ments in several metropolitan news-
I papers, Maloney denied the state
ment that Stanford had already
been awarded the tryouts, saying
, that this is a grave misunderstand
ing on the part of the sports writers
I who were responsible for the an
nouncement.
Stanford is very anxious to secure
: the Olympic Game tryouts, Maloney
j added, and should the committee
| meeting Sunday adopt a resolution
i to accept the Indians' invitation the
| Executive Committee will formally
recognize this at its meeting on No
! vember 29 in New York City. Stan
ford will be represented at this
j meeting by A1 Masters, who will be
i East at that time for the Dartmouth
| game.
The tryouts will probably be hold
j sometime in July, about two week.-,
j prior to the actual events in Los
1 Angeles, it was revealed.
1.C.4-A. Meeting
Also going East as the represent-
I c.tive of the Pacific Athletic Associ
i ation, Maloney will attend the meet
-1 ing of the Amateur Athletic Union
! ol America in Kansas City and will
i attempt to get the 1932 convention
J in San Francisco. If this is accom
plished, the famous 1.C.4-A. meet
: will be held here next year, Ma-
I loney said.
