# CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS

Willi lire in his eye and vitriol dripping from his type
writer keys, Editor Jack Mason of the Daily (lalifornian
lias taken a crack at the Stantohd Daily for daring to
admit that Southern California has a pretty good football
team. In the same article Mason condemns the Daily Tro
jan for commenting favorably on the Daily's editorial.
You seem quite amazed, Jack, to see this, gesture of
friendship between the Iwo schools which you thought
were established enemies. It rather leaves California out
in the cold, doesn't it?
And this friendly feeling was so totally different from
the relationship that you feel is proper between two uni
versities that von, Mr. Mason, had to stoop down low and
search for\some petty excuse which you thought must be
back of this cordiality. You think that both schools were
afraid that they might lose the Trojan-Indian grid battle
and felt necessary to put up a defense beforehand.
Did you know, Jack, that there is such a thing as friend
ship without some ulterior motive skulking in the back
ground? Apparently not, so if the Daily Californian ever
offers us a friendly hand, we will grip it with an uneasy
feeling, glancing all the while over our shoulder for your
selfish reason for wanting to appear a friend.
Oh, it's easy enough to see why you tried so hard to
scoff at Stanford and U.S.C., Jack. It makes your "Hate
Stanford" attitude that you have attempted to instill in
California students seem pretty small, doesn't it? It must
irritate you terribly to think that the Daily Trojan doesn't
want all its readers to hate Stanford too.
Another thorn in your side is the Axe. Why couldn't
you lose it without going around shouting, "I hate you,"
like a little schoolgirl? We might yet sink it in the Golden
Rear's somewhat greasy hide on November 21, but we
won't hate California, the referee or anybody else if we
lose.
