# HO HUM! WAR IS HERE NOW

Hopes for ;i new nil-lime Daily record were shattered
yesterday when Arthur MeEwen, 'M, cracked through wilh
ii Campus Opinion protesting the militaristic spirit on the
Stanford campus. After the lirst five weeks of the quarter
had passed without any such outburst against Mars being
sent to the Daily, hopes had been raised that maybe cus
tom would be broken and the pacifists would remain pa
cific. However, McEwen has wrecked any chance of that,
and his protest appears in an adjoining column.
The Daily would like to wax wroth on the subject one
wav or the other, but unfortunately, the subject has been
hashed over before and dismissed, by the Daily, at least,
as not very important.
Because a youth would shoulder a rifle while in colic
rather than do setting-up exercises in Physical Education 1
is no sign that he is going to cry for blood when he is
graduated. And as for the Five Hundred standing agape
in admiration of the "natty uniforms and gleaming brass
buttons" well, hooey. In the lirst place, officers of Scab
bard and Blade rarely, if ever, wear their outfits oji Quad;
in the second place, the Stanford woman doesn't give a
continental about it if they do; in the third place, what
of it ? It's who is wearing the uniform that counts, anyway.
Most of the beating on flic war drum is done by pacifists
who cry out against it. Eel sleeping dogs lie.
