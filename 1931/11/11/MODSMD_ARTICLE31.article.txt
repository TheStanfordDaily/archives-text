THE LITTLE T

Every lime one picks up a maga
zine, or tries lo cross in front of the
Post Office at noon, or listens to a
public speaker of any description—
he is reminded in vivid fashion that
this is the "Machine Age." It is
claimed by many that man is the
servant and is served by the won
ders of science. On all sides mechan
ics is threatening the very inde
pendence of man. Some delight in
showing how from the time our
alarm clock rings at 7:30 and we
shut it off and roll over on our steel
bed till late at night when we sit by
man-made suns and listen to tinny
jazz orchestras come over the ether
waves from far-off places; from
dawn until dawn again our lives are
made easier, the story runs, by
mechanics.
Now so long have we lived on this
.sort of stuff, that when one after
noon we turned to comb our flowing
mane in front of the mirror, and
found ourselves looking at a bare
space on the wall of the men's
washroom in the Library, our faith
in mankind, momentarily at least,
was completely blasted. It couldn't
be true! For years, mirrors had been
considered as essential to life as air
itself. That has been about a month
ago! Each day we cautiously open
the door, and timorously cast' a
hopeful glance where of yore the
mirror did hang.
But each time the same empty
space bares its ugly shape lo the
light of day—a living contradiction
to the age of science. Students have
written on the wall, "We Want a
Mirror," and other more forceful,
less printable, but equally meaning-

lINGS IN LIFE

ful requests. Every so often some
body takes the pains to wash oft
these demands—down to the last
stroke of some petitioning pencil—
but aside from this, nothing is done.

Rumor has it that the mirror was
stolen; some say :t was broken. As
sume that some student needed the
mirror for his housekeeping apart
ment. Because it, was taken is no
reason for not replacing it. If our
librarian, or whoever is responsible
for replacing mirrors, should lose a
collar button through act of theft
or act of God, we would not expect
him to appear the next day without
a collar. It; may sound incongrous
to speak of librarians without col
lars, but it is no more pathetic ihan
to speak of washrooms without mir
rors 3,431 years after glass was in
vented.
It is regrettable that mention must
be made in print that in 1931 A.D.
there was a washroom in a modern
library, at Stanford, which fairly
reeks with engineers and slide-rules,
without a mirror. If mirrors are
stolen with such persistency as to
threaten the Library with financial
ruin if they should replace them,
perhaps some system can be devised
by which the glass can be so placed
in the wall to defy the strongest of
thievers.
About four mirror-less weeks
have gone by. To re-establish the
student's faith that this is the age
of science; to make the Phi Beta
Lodge as liveable as any of the other
Greek quarters on the campus, it
behooves Mr. Van Patten, Director
of University Libraries, to get a
mirror in the men's washroom.
