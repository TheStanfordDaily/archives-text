## THE 						WAR FOR PEACE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
November 12 is the last day for
paying syllabus fees, but November
11 is just any old day at Stanford.
Armistice Day as it is here could
better be called Preparedness Day.
We seem to celebrate the world's
day of peace with the romance in
stead of the realism of war. Witness
the display of handsome Scabbard
and Blade officers clad in natty uni
forms and gleaming brass buttons.
Supposedly the cream of young fe
male intelligence, women of the 500
stand agape in admiration of the
jangling sabers sported by youths
who are initiated into the fraternity
of the military-minded. Worse yet,
the more enthusiastic co-eds cluster
around their favoi'ite officers on the

very quadrangle where the late
apostle of peace, Dr. David Starr
Jordan, once proclaimed his human
itarian doctrines of peace.

This emotional attachment to the
machine of militarism may prove
worse than it appears today. Unless
moves are made to offset Mars'
courtship of womanhood, the next
outrage on this campus will be a
corps of pretty co-ed colonels strut
ting about with the sugar-coated
pride of jingo patriotism that goes
hand in hand with college military
training. The University of Chicago
is cursed with women R.O.T.C. of
ficers. Girls at the University of
Cincinnati hang polished gilt-edge
sabers from their Sam Brown belts.
Elsewhere the young ladies are

learning to aim, fire, and hit the i
target. '
These frills and thrills that blind
and bind youth to war preparation
should be checked immediately on
this campus that was for so many ]
years the stronghold of that great ;
peace leader, Dr. Jordan.
The first move should be to do j
away with the gilded military ap- i
peal of Scabbard and Blade.
Youthful militarists may stagger 5
beneath the heaviest and gaudiest j
gold-braided uniforms available if j
it suits their fancy, but in good taste j
and in respect for Dr. Jordan they
should leave these trappings of war I
in the campus arsenal anjl make ;
themselves less conspicuous.
If this unwarranted display of the ,
army uniform is banished from sight, 1
the emotions that help to keep the j
war spirit alive in the hearts of !
young women may flicker out |
quietly.
It's all right if you feel that you
must be a war dog, but at least be !
a civilian in public!
