CHINATOWN QUEST—By Carol ;
Green Wilson. Stanford University |
Press. 1931. (On sale at the Stan
ford Bookstore. $3.00.)
A tale as thrilling as a gangster
movie, spun around a devotion to
duty that is strong as life itself. The
time-worn phrase, truth is stranger !
than fiction, was never more aptly j
applied than to this story of the life j
and adventures of Donaldina Cam- \
eron.
Chinatown in San Francisco in j
days not so far past was fertile 1
ground for the growth of a slave j
trade, dealing in the tiny, flower- j
like Orientals. To bring freedom and j
the right to live to these bits of 1
human flotsam, Miss Cameron has i
beaten down the organized strength
of highbinder and tongman.
One phase of the biography deals ,
with Palo Alto, where Stanford Uni- j
versity students swarmed to the j
rescue of Miss Cameron when she !
was lodged in the local lock-up on j
fictitious charges of child-stealing, j
But read it —P.H.

THE MAGNET—By Maxim Gorki.
Jonathan Cape and Harrison
Smith. 1931.
"The Magnet" is the second of
the triology which Gorki considers
to be his life work. "Bystander,"
published a year ago, was the first.
The various stages in the life of one
man is the theme for the novels. In
"Bystander" the youth of one of the
Russian intelligentsia is described.
He is thoughtful, critical, and aloof.
The book closes with Clim's deciding
that the work of a critic is all that
he is fitted or interested in doing.
In "The Magnet," Clim, a mature
man now, as a journalist is still a
bystander. He is chiefly occupied
with observing the efforts of the
intelligentsia to improve the lot of
the peasant class. Pie is always
about to be drawn into an active
existence yet he remains on the out
side.
Whether this is Gorki's maitre
d'oeuvre or not has caused consider
able discussion among critics. It; has
been said that it is too realistic to
be art. Be that ar. it may, it is a
great work of some kind by a great
writer. -*-E.T.P.
