# The 						Windjammer
## CHEERFUL NOTE 
### 
| Do you, Phi Bete, ever brood
Because an A leads not to fame?
j Just buckle down and dig right in—
I The results will be the same.
Don't cry, lawyer, if the votes show
That you were wrongly judged
Success will come to those with grit—
I And a conscience easily budged.
Weep not, artist, if your income
Makes you find a job.
' Artistic fame is won by skill—
I In pandering to the mob.
I i
; do your best, all you people,
Among the strong you're listed,
i You'll find reward in the hereafter —
If such a thing existed.
Buddy Rogers was just completing
his college journalism course when
called to the movies.—Press agent
I squib in the Examiner.
I That's all right, Buddy, that's all
right. There's an overproduction of
! society editors anyway.
| Windjammer made an awful mis-
I take, last week, and unintentionally
; insinuated that a very respectable
restaurant and smoke shop in Paly
i was several things that it isn't. We
mentioned card games when we
meant hymn-book practice—only a
: slip of the tongue. Actually, we'd
trusl our youngest brother to Thur
, low's care, if we had one. That's an
! abject apology, and we feel better.
1 Is everybody happy?
