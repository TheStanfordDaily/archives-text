California will be given a mid
week football treat today with im
portant games being played in both
northern and southern California.
The most important contest is the
annual Army-Navy Armistice Day
grid classic in the California Me
morial Stadium. A crowd of 60,000
is expected to turn out and view
the spectacle. As usual an impres
sive military and naval pageant fea
turing 10,000 uniformed men will
accompany the football game.
For the first time in the his
tory of the event the Navy is
favored to win. They have made
a remarkable showing this sea
son, having lost only one game
to the Olympic Club, 7 to (5. On
the other hand the Army has
won only one contest. But re
cently they have improved in
holding Santa Clara and S.F.U.
to tie games. At any rate the
score tomorrow will be close.
Another contest that will attract
interest is the St. Mary's-U.C.L.A.
tilt scheduled for this afternoon at
the Olympic Stadium in Los An
geles, scene of the Trojan victory
over Stanford last Saturday. Con
sidering the recent setback ol the
Gaels by the Olympic Club and the
improved play of the Bruins in their
last game against Stanford, it looks
like a tough contest for the "would
be national champions."
Bill Spaulding's outfit is no
setup for anyone this year as
Fop Warner discovered: so un
less the Moragans show some of
their early-season winning fight,
we may find Slip Madigan's
crew slipping further into (he
losing column.
Another factor in the Bruin's ad
vantage is that the Gaels played
their hardest game of the season
only four days ago and came out of
it with several injuries that will
keep a couple of stars out of the
game. And the team in general will
not be fully recovered from Sun
day's tussle.
California and Stanford both take
it easy this Saturday with "breath
ers" on their schedules. But it looks
like the Bears will have to breathe
harder before their setup is won
Ingram's squad meets Idaho. No one
ever gave Idaho a thought unti
last Saturday when they held Wash
ington State 9 to S. And at that the
Cougars won only in the last few
minutes of play.
Stanford's breather is with the
Nevada Wolf Pack, The Neva
dans proved no trouble for Cali
fornia a week and a half ago
when they succumbed to the
score of 25 to 7. Pop Warner will
be able to give his entire first
squad a rest this week.

annual Army-Navy Armistice Day
grid classic in the California Me
morial Stadium. A crowd of 60,000
is expected to turn out and view
the spectacle. As usual an impres
sive military and naval pageant fea
turing 10,000 uniformed men will
accompany the football game.
For the first time in the his
tory of the event the Navy is
favored to win. They have made
a remarkable showing this sea
son, having lost only one game
to the Olympic Club, 7 to (5. On
the other hand the Army has
won only one contest. But re
cently they have improved in
holding Santa Clara and S.F.U.
to tie games. At any rate the
score tomorrow will be close.
Another contest that will attract
interest is the St. Mary's-U.C.L.A.
tilt scheduled for this afternoon at
the Olympic Stadium in Los An
geles, scene of the Trojan victory
over Stanford last Saturday. Con
sidering the recent setback ol the
Gaels by the Olympic Club and the
improved play of the Bruins in their
last game against Stanford, it looks
like a tough contest for the "would
be national champions."
Bill Spaulding's outfit is no
setup for anyone this year as
Fop Warner discovered: so un
less the Moragans show some of
their early-season winning fight,
we may find Slip Madigan's
crew slipping further into (he
losing column.
Another factor in the Bruin's ad
vantage is that the Gaels played
their hardest game of the season
only four days ago and came out of
it with several injuries that will
keep a couple of stars out of the
game. And the team in general will
not be fully recovered from Sun
day's tussle.
California and Stanford both take
it easy this Saturday with "breath
ers" on their schedules. But it looks
like the Bears will have to breathe
harder before their setup is won
Ingram's squad meets Idaho. No one
ever gave Idaho a thought unti
last Saturday when they held Wash
ington State 9 to S. And at that the
Cougars won only in the last few
minutes of play.
Stanford's breather is with the
Nevada Wolf Pack, The Neva
dans proved no trouble for Cali
fornia a week and a half ago
when they succumbed to the
score of 25 to 7. Pop Warner will
be able to give his entire first
squad a rest this week.
