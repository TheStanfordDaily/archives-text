yesterday, 1-0.
From start to finish both teams
played in deadly earnest, the Indian |
seeking the conference scalp, and j
the Bulldog doing his best to save ,
his championship collar.
Hearn Scores
Stanford's lone score came after [
a mix-up in front of the visitors' j
net, when Art Hearn drove a long |
powerful shot between the uprights |
from the penalty line. It was a per- |
feet cross-goal kick that turned out
to be all the scoring for the after- j
noon.
The Redshirts started out rather j
slowly, with two substitutes at the j
wing positions, and the team seem- j
ingly suffering from too many 4 j
o'clock classes.
Visitors Threaten
The suburbanites went after a
win from the opening whistle, and
it was not long before the Big Red
Machine found itself being pushed
all over the lot by the persistent
Bulldogs.
Shortly after Coach Harry Ma
loney sent in his first-string wings,
however, the varsity began hitting
on all eleven, and a score was the
result.
Coming back after the half-time,
| the Mateans launched an offensive
| drive that had the Indians backed
; against the totem poles for the rest
lof the afternoon. Time and again
i the fine work of that great defensive
| trio, Webster, Holmes, and Brekel
! baum, was all that kept Stanford's
! lead intact.
Second Half Fast
As dusk settled over the field,
j making it difficult for even the
i players to follow the ball, the Bull-
I dogs threw caution to the winds and
i tried shots from any and all angles,
j No try seemed too doubtful for at
! least an attempt. If the visitors had
! played the first half as they did the
' last, it is doubtful if the Indian
: would be still dreaming of the
| league bunting today.
As it is, however, the Cards arc
j still very much in the race. Having
! been tied only once, and with five
| victories to their credit, they have
just three more hurdles to clear.
Two of them are Bears, and the
I third is S.F.U. The Hilltoppers hold
| the scoreless tie with the Indians,
but they have also been tied by the
j Bears and Bulldogs.

Second Half Fast
As dusk settled over the field,
j making it difficult for even the
i players to follow the ball, the Bull-
I dogs threw caution to the winds and
i tried shots from any and all angles,
j No try seemed too doubtful for at
! least an attempt. If the visitors had
! played the first half as they did the
' last, it is doubtful if the Indian
: would be still dreaming of the
| league bunting today.
As it is, however, the Cards arc
j still very much in the race. Having
! been tied only once, and with five
| victories to their credit, they have
just three more hurdles to clear.
Two of them are Bears, and the
I third is S.F.U. The Hilltoppers hold
| the scoreless tie with the Indians,
but they have also been tied by the
j Bears and Bulldogs.

yesterday, 1-0.
From start to finish both teams
played in deadly earnest, the Indian |
seeking the conference scalp, and j
the Bulldog doing his best to save ,
his championship collar.
Hearn Scores
Stanford's lone score came after [
a mix-up in front of the visitors' j
net, when Art Hearn drove a long |
powerful shot between the uprights |
from the penalty line. It was a per- |
feet cross-goal kick that turned out
to be all the scoring for the after- j
noon.
The Redshirts started out rather j
slowly, with two substitutes at the j
wing positions, and the team seem- j
ingly suffering from too many 4 j
o'clock classes.
Visitors Threaten
The suburbanites went after a
win from the opening whistle, and
it was not long before the Big Red
Machine found itself being pushed
all over the lot by the persistent
Bulldogs.
Shortly after Coach Harry Ma
loney sent in his first-string wings,
however, the varsity began hitting
on all eleven, and a score was the
result.
Coming back after the half-time,
| the Mateans launched an offensive
| drive that had the Indians backed
; against the totem poles for the rest
lof the afternoon. Time and again
i the fine work of that great defensive
| trio, Webster, Holmes, and Brekel
! baum, was all that kept Stanford's
