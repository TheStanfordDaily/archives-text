# SCOTLAND YARD IN DARK ABOUT THEFT
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 10. Wâ€”Scotland
I Yard has been in the dark about a
i light problem. First-class electric
1 bulbs have a way of vanishing from
j the premises, to be replaced by
cheaper bulbs. None of the detec
! tives was able to trace the thief.
Recently the bulbs have been
i fixed in position so that it will take
I a hacksaw or a burglary outfit to
I remove them.
