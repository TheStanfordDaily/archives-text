# RECITAL MARKS ARMISTICE DAY
## U. Of Michigan Organist To Play At 11 o'Clock 
### 
In observance of Armistice Day,
Stanford students and faculty will
assemble in the Memorial Church
this morning from 11 to 12 o'clock
to hear an organ recital by Palmer
Christian, University of Michigan
organist.
In keeping with the sentiment of
the occasion, this well-known or
ganist, in his second appearance at
Stanford since 1927, has chosen a
program that is international in
character. The selections, which
have been chosen from Russian
American, German, Belgium, Eng
lish, and French composers are:
Fantasie Bubeck
Andante Cantabile ... .Philip James
Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor
J. S. Bach
Prelude Elegiaque. . .Joseph Jongen
Allegretto from the Organ Sonata
* Edward Elgar
Finale (Symphony VI).. C. M. Widor
Benediction Sigfrid Karg-Elert
The last composition, written by
Germany's most distinguished organ
composer, was considered the most
appropriate with which to finish the
recital, as it is a significant interpre
tation in music of the desire for
peace among the nations.
A five-minute period of silent
meditation followed by a benediction
by the Reverend D. Charles Gard
ner, University chaplain, will ter
minate the exercises.
As there will be no 11 o'clock
classes today, those who wish to at
tend the recital are urged to be on
time, as the music will begin
promptly at 11:10 o'clock.
