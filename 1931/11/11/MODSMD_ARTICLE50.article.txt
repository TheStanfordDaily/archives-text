After fighting the fast Alpha Delt
outfit to a standstill for three quar- s
ters of yesterday's intramural grid
contest, the Theta Delts lost out j ]
6-0 when a punt bounced off one i i
of their own men and was carried | ]
I across the line by Fuller, who 1
i scooped up the pigskin while travel- i .
i ing at top speed.
i The Theta Delts twice missed op
! portunities to score when passes i (
1 fell incomplete behind the goal line. ;
Sigma Chi's Win 7-0
Having absorbed two crushing de- .
i feats previously, the tail-end Se
quoia II aggregation put up a great
1 defensive battle against the power- j
ful Sigma Chi's, defending intra- j
| mural champions, finally losing out !
1 7-0. «
At that the Row men had to re- j
j sort to the ancient "sleeper" play |
' to put a score across. Joujon-Roche !
| stood over by the crowd along the ;
| side-lines until Larsen decided to i
j throw a pass in that direction. The ;
j conversion was Larsen to Stearns. I
The Sigma Chi's failed in a number j
\ pf chances to score when passes fell i
| incomplete over the line or were j
| knocked down by alert Sequoians. '
El Capitan Defeated
In another close battle, the El ;
Capitan team eked out a 7-6 ver- j
diet over the A.K.L.'s. On the only j
drive that the Clubmen managed to
[get beyond ( the 50-yard line, Shipey |
ran half the length of the field after j
I a 10-yard pass from Stump. He was ;
| caught on the 5-yarcl marker, but j
| another pass, Stump to Karmel, was ■
i good for the score. The conversion, ;
! which turned out to be their margin j
I of victory, was Stump to Mason.
The A.K.L.'s garnered their lone !
score on a 30-yard pass, McCoy to 1
j Thorup.
El Toro Victorious
Two passes, Loomis to Puthoff and I
1 Puthoff to Herbert, were enough to \
1 j give the El Toro outfit a 13-7 vie- j
' tory over the Kappa Sigs. The one I
> [ conversion was a pass, Loomis to ;
| Morse.
After throwing away two perfectly
good chances to score, on tosses over
3 the goal-line, the Kappa Sigs finally

managed to ring one up on a 20- '
yard heave, Goldman to Redhead.
They converted, Goldman to King,
so either one of their throws over
the line would have tied up the
game, had they been caught.
Los Arcos Downed
S.A.E. chalked up a 13-6 triumph
over the Los Arcos boys on Shidler's
reverse around right end and
Budge's toss to Beenfeldt. Triplett
drop-kicked the extra point.
Madden scored for Los Arcos on a ,
short pass and a 30-yarcl run.
Phi Delta Theta handed the Chi
Psi!s a 19-0 trouncing when Case
ran around right end on the first
play of the game for 80 yards, Pett
threw 20 yards to Saufley, and Case
skirted right end again. Donlon
kicked the one conversion.
The Chi Psi's were able to make
only two first downs, both in the .
last few minutes of play.
