# U. OF C. PROFESSOR MAKES RAPID FIRE LECTURING RECORD
## French Speaks To Classes Here And At Cal In Same Morning 
### 
Professor Will J. French of the
University of California established
some sort of record yesterday morn
ing when he delivered two lectures,
one at Berekley and the other at
Stanford. After delivering the first,
he motored to Palo Alto, and
promptly at 11 o'clock began his sec
ond address. The topic concerned
the duties and accomplishments of
the California State Industrial Rela
tions Department, of which he is
director.
The history of the development of
the Various departments of state
under the leadership of Governor
C. C. Young was briefly summarized
by Professor French.
"The Department of Industrial
Relations, after its creation, was or
ganized into six divisions, including
the Industrial Accident and Welfare
Departments," he said. "An interest
ing example of the effectiveness of
workmen's compensation was illus
trated in the case of a worker in a
mine who broke his back. He was
expected to live for only a few days,
but he has lingered in the hospital
for four years. His care requires a
day and night nurse, private room,
and his expenses are $100 per week.
The workmen's compensation insur
ance pays his bill."
"Another employee who suffered
the loss of both hands, has, through
a system of rehabilitation, become
very proficient in writing and other
seemingly impossible accomplish
ments. Seasonal employment agen
cies, labor campus supervision, and
traffic officers trained in first-aid
principles have also been instigated
by the Industrial Depai'tment."
Other larger activities of the de
partment recently undertaken in
clude a study of the Mexican situa
tion in California, old-age in indus
try, and safety of workers during
the construction of the Boulder
Dam.
