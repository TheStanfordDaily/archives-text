# SCHENCK RETURNS FROM FIELD TRIP TO OREGON COAST
## Geology Of Cascade Range Observed In Fossils; Publish Results 
### 
Professor Hubert G. Schenck of
the Department of Geology returned
yesterday from a 10-day trip to
western Oregon in connection with
a project which he began in 1916,
the working out of the geological
history of western Oregon. As a re
sult of his work on this and previous
trips, Professor Schenck now has
the finest known collection of fossil
mollusks of the Oligocene epoch
from this region.
Conclusive proof that the Cascade
Range came into existence during
the Miocene epoch some 6,000,000
years ago has been obtained by Pro
fessor Schenck, for previous to that
time moisture-laden winds went as
far as eastern Oregon, where giant
redwood forests once thrived.
But beginning in the Oligocene
epoch estimated at about 8,000,000
years ago there was great volcanic
activity and the Cascade Range be
gan to rise, in time shutting off the
moisture from the redwoods and
causing their extinction in the east
ern Oregon region.
Professor Schenck's latest trip
was for the purpose of finding the
relative positions of fossiliferous
beds and adding to his collection of
Tertiary fossils. The results of his
work will be published sometime in
the future.
