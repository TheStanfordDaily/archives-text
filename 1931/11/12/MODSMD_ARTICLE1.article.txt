### 
AT NOON today the Class of '35 will begin its 150-hour vigil on the
scene of the Big Game bonfire, a vigil which will end only when the
giant pyre goes up in smoke Wednesday night. Four powerful floodlights
will be in place before dark today, Bill Werder, chairman, said last night,
and the first crew of freshman guards will go on duty at 10 p.m.
"If enough frosh turn out and work today we will get the foundation
laid," W'erder declared. "The P. G. & E. crews will have the corner piles up
this morning, and the first job for us will be to dig draft pits underneath."

A women's committee under Mary
Lou James and Marian Hewlett will
be in charge of arrangements to fur
nish food for the 20-man guard
crews, which will work all night in
four-hour shifts. Roble and all
sororities will be called upon to fur
nish sandwiches, starting tonight.
Several offers have already been re
ceived from Palo Alto and Mayfield
merchants, it is reported.
S.P. Gives Wood
The largest contributor of fuel so
far has been the Southern Pacific,
which has donated several hundred
old ties and a large quantity of
other wood. Werder said last night
that the committee has been prom
ised the use of several trucks, all of
which will be on duty today.
The chairman again urged that all
information as to the sources of
burnable material be telephoned to
Ihe Delta Tau Delta house, so that
trucks can be sent for collection.
The bonfire will be 30 feet square
at the base, and the main body will
tower 40 feet high. On top of this a
slender, 30-foot campanile will be
erected, using a rick of railroad ties
as the base.
Fast Work Needed
"Since we have such a short time
in which to complete the building,
it is imperative that every freshman
work as much as possible," yaid
Marvie Kahn, Encina Club presi
dent, last night. "We have a good
organization, with a live crew of
captains, and are set to build a real
bonfire."
The huge pile will be burned im
mediately after Ihe Big Game Pa
vilion rally Wednesday night.
