"Laval," a sketch by Robert
Brauns and Robert Place, and "Good

j ment of a modern situation, by Gor
-1 don Steedman, were announced last
night by Harold ITelvenston in ad
-1 dition to the sketches by Don Cam
eron, Bob Cathcart, Tom Pockman,
and Waldo Salts announced yester
day. Helvenston is in charge of the
entire show.
Abundant Material
There has been twice as much ma
-1 terial presented this year than ever
before. This fact, coupled with an
1 enthusiastic turnout of talent, indi
cates very successful Football Gaie
! ties. Most of the sketches are com
ing in from students hitherto un
known in this line.
; The musical numbers under the
direction of Roger Sumner are pret
ty well set. Many good new snappy
"Bring on the Show", and "It Seems
remembered for his two songs,
numbers will be used. Sumner is
to Be the Thing to Do," in the 1930
1 Gaieties. He ajso composed the hit
number, "Russia," heard in "Prole
i tariat Plus," last year's Junior
j Opera.
Monologues Secret
i Everyone who is interested in
being in the Gaieties, and who has
I not yet been cast, should meet Hel
: venston tonight at 8:30 o'clock in
I the Green Room.
j Two monologues, which are being
j kept extremely secret, will probably,
J as in years past, be the laugh high
j points of the show. The Ram's Head
Gaieties will go on as usual on the
evening before the Big Game, No
i vember 20.
