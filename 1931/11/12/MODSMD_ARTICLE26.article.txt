# Warner Directs Stanford Squad In Signal Drills
## Tentative Lineup Announced by Coach for Nevada Game Combines First, Second, and Third-String Men Including Afflerbaugh HARDY APPOINTED AS MOFFATT UNDERSTUDY Ingram Plans to Start First String Against Idaho in Saturday's Game; Moffatt Better 
### DICK RODDA 
pOR the first time since the U.S.C. game the entire Stanford squad re
ported to football practice last night to participate only in signal drills
and light workouts on the dummy machines. Harry Hillman, Phil Moffatt,
Rudy Rintala, Phil Baker, and Bill Corbus were the only members of th«
varsity w ho were not in uniform
At the conclusion of practice Warner announced a tentative starting
lineup for the Nevada game consisting of a new combination of firnt.-

'second,- and third-string men an
follows:
Left end—Wittenau
Left tackle—Grey
Left guard—Scribner
Center—Bates
Right guard—Kite
Right tackle—Gribben
Right end—Norgard
Quarterback —Targhetta
Left halfback—-Afflerbaugh
Right halfback—Wilson
Fullback—Jack Hillman
Outside of the fact that this is an
unusual lineup in itself the only im
portant variation is that Kenny At
fierbaugh, as expected, has been
switched to Moffatt's position at
left halfback. This means that in the
absence of Moffatt for the Big Game
the Cardinal "key position" will still
have two capable men to fill it.
Hardy For Moffatt
Spud Hardy, present Moffatt un
derstudy, is the other man who will
be able to fill the post. Hardy has
been a consistent threat all season
in playing this position while Mof
fatt was injured. However, the fact
that Afflerbaugh is an excellent
kicker may make him the choice for
the Big Game unless Ernie Caddel
maintains his U.S.C. punting aver
age.
Meanwhile, Bill Ingram, in pre
paring his California Bears for the
Big Game, has announced that he
will start his first string against
Idaho next Saturday. It was origi
'nally believed that both Stanford
and California could take it easy
with "breathers" scheduled the week
before they meet. But because of
the fact that Idaho held Washington
State to a 9 to 8 score last Saturday,
Bill Ingram's setup has turned out.
to be just another "tough contest,"
hence, the first-string lineup.
Moffatt Better
Phil Moffatt's condition was re
ported as better last night with i
slight possibility remaining that he
may be ready for the Big Game.
Hillman, Baker, and Corbus are in
the Palo Alto Hospital but none are
seriously injured. However, unless
either Hillman or Baker are recov
ered by this Saturday, Warner will
have to rely upon Targhetta to back
up the line for most of the Nevada
game.
Baker was placed in the hospital
yesterday and Coi bus was taken
there today. Both seem to be suffer
ing from an epidemic of boils that
hit the squad.
