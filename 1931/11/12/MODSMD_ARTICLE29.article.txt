# 100 PER CENT IS THE GOAL
## 
### 
Stanford students arc being called upon to aid in a
.ureal national emergency with the start of the I\e<l Cross
drive on the campus yesterday as part of a nationwide
relief campaign.
The tremendous work accomplished by the Red Cross
is well known. It is the principal agency,in this country
for the alleviation of suffering, misery and want. Hut it
needs funds to conduct this service and for these the or
ganization must turn to the people of the nation. Persons
who have must contribute if those who have not are to
exist.
A student committee will canvas the campus in a search
for members of the Red Cross and every man and woman
in the l niversitv should contribute a dollar, b the price of
the membership fee. Although the spending money of
many students has been curtailed this year, there is no
one who cannot afford to give this small amount.
A student list of 100 per cent in the Roll Call would be
a proof that the members of this University realized the
scope of the present national emergency and were willing
to do what they could to turn aside the wolf from the door
of the country.
