Not satisfied with the performance of their horse at the
last rally, the members of the Rally Committee have <le-!
tided to retrieve their lost respect hy exhibiting a bear cub j
at the Rig (lame rally.
An alumnus, anxious for the success of the rally, has J
graciously offered to send the creature to the campus from !
its northern haunts free of charge.
Perhaps the appearance of a hear on the platform will
incite some of the insipid members of the student body to
attend the rally who would not appear for the mere pur
pose of arousing Stanford spirit and the attendance mayj
thus be greater than the puny crowd that trickled into the
Pavilion before the V.S.C. game.
.
The campus is in the grip of the depression of some-j
thing equally ominous when the Rally Committee has to
pull off publicity stunts to get (lie students out to cheer the j
team before an important game.
