# AN ENTERTAINING EVENING
## 
### 
Two dark-complexioned young gentlemen from far-off
Turkey furnished a small crowd in the assembly hall last
Monday night with a very entertaining evening.
The two young gentlemen were A. Galib Rifat and Suha!
Zeki, debaters from Roberts -College, who met the Stanford,
team on the question of which is the more dangerous, Rol
shevism or Fascism.
Their polished manners, their splendid method, of de
livery and their slight accent all combined to enhance their j
brilliant arguments in a charming manner.
The Stanford duo did its share toward making the eve
ning a complete success from a forensic viewpoint and the
arguments tliev advanced against the stand of the foreign |
invaders were well taken and complete.
If the remaining debates this year are as interesting and
exciting as this last one, it would be well worth the while
of everyone that can push, crowd or elbow his way into tlie
auditorium to attend.
Incidentally, one cannot imagine a worse place in l
which to listen to a debate than the Stanford assembly hall.
