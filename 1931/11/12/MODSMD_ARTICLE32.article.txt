Stanford, it is commonly reported, is well supplied with
biologists, zoologists, chemists, engineers and janitors.
And yet Encina Hall, Encina gymnasium and sundry
other places are overrun with an apparently inexhaustible
supply of ants. A few feeble efforts with spray guns and
supposedly poisonous powders have been made to stem
the advance of the invaders but to no avail.
And these menacing pests are of the most ferocious
type, biting their victims while they sleep and leaving large
red spots on the slumbering bodies as mementoes of their
victorious campaign. They are cruel, ruthless and blood
thirsty and have no mercy for their helpless victims.
The great minds of this University should combine
against this ever-increasing horde and devise some new
means of warfare to combat this red menace, some poison
ous spray, some death-dealing powder that will extinguish
forever this avaricious army that threatens the serenity of
our campus.
