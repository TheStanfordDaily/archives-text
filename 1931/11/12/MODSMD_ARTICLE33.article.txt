# BULL SESSION
## SHADES OF JEFFERSON 
### 
Back in the days when the fathers j
of the nation were giving birth to
I the Constitution and the patriots
J were enjoying the first taste of in
j dependence, there was formulated a
doctrine called "states rights." The 1
I exponents of this view ranted far ,
I and loud on such abstract terms as j
"liberty" and "home rule." Forcer- j
tain economic reasons, these silver
! tongued orators who felt that the ;
i central government should be
watched and limited, congregated i
south of the Mason-Dixon Line and
ultimately became associated with j
j the Democratic Party.
As the nation advanced, the doc- j
j trine of states-rights became a j
theory and finally degenerated into 1
1 a hazy myth—held alive only by a
few genuine Jeffersonian Democrats
in the South, men who wore colored j
vests, and who year after year re- j
turned to Congress to give vent to !
their antiquated views. The popu- !
! lace listened to these white-haired
i Southerners out of curiosity for the j
! idea seemed relegated to the past. !
The government, as President Wil- ;
! but once intimated became a "bu- ;
1 reaucracy held together by red J
tape." The government became cen- j
j tralized and everybody forgot states- j
] rights.
Very recently, however, the old |
j doctrine has been reborn—it was j
j reborn more particularly and very i
I emphatically the other evening when '
General Pershing called upon the ;
states and communities to aid the i
relief work; it was he who pointed |
out that it was the states that formed j
the nation; and it was the states that j
were to lead us out of the hardships j
j of the coming winter. Washington, |

! D.C., has increased its functions—
has consolidated and centra I i*ed —
for years; and now when want is
facing the nation, the states are
called upon to give and give and
1 give some more.
It has been the policy of Hoover
! and his Relief Commission that aid
| in this crisis shall come from the
states. The reason for this is to stop
; a mounting federal deficit and fur
i ther it is felt that "local" giving will
be easier to encourage than giving
i into a national coffer. This is prob-
I ably true.
There is, however, one factor ihat
| is vital and forgotten. By the scrap
ping of the states-rights doctrine,
1 the welfare of any one state auto
matically becomes p national prob
lem. Centralization is funny that
j way. It gives lots of money and lots
j of power during prosperity but it
1 also entails lots of spending and
1 lots of obligations during depres
< sion. The state of depression and the
j pei-eapita wealth varies in the dif
. ferent states. To expect each state
j to bear its own burden is not only
: an injustice and an impossibility on
J some states, but permits some slates
I to escape relatively easy.
There are certain southern and
I western states that are poor and it
' is these poor states whei'e suffering
| next winter will be greatest and
■ ability to give aid will be least. It
1 will be incumbent on the Federal
| Government to help these members
i of our Union; it is not only a moral
I duty but it is a necessary corollary
j to a government that in practice has
j banished the theory of a federation
| of quasi-independent states.

j of power during prosperity but it
1 also entails lots of spending and
1 lots of obligations during depres
< sion. The state of depression and the
j pei-eapita wealth varies in the dif
