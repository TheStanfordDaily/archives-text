HIGH STAKES—At the Varsity !
Theatre.
In spite of the flashy sounding \
title, "High Stakes," the picture sue- !
cceds in being decidedly sophisti
cated. The smooth acting necessary ]
to carry the clever, rapid dialogue is ,
well sustained by all the cast, but '
by Lowell Sherman in particular.
I Sherman plays the blundering,
j witty, unsuccessful playwright who
| ends with solving everyone's prob- j
I lems and soothing everyone's feel- '
ings. His characterization is so com- !
; plete that it is difficult to say i
i whether his lines or his personality j
! are responsible for making him the !
1 outstanding member of the cast. Mae 1
I Murray does the part of the gold- '
: digger with designs on Sherman's |
S elderly brother. Karen Morley, re- j
i cently arrived, made a charming !
secretary.
An excellent treatment of a trite !
plot. , —E.T.P.
LADIES ABOUT TOWN—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
i Logically, Kay Francis' gorgeous 1
! gowns should begin to pall the pub- i

! lie, but each time she wears some
| thing better and different, so we
! continue to gaze. This time Lilyan
! Tashman shares the honors, and
neither woman suffers by contrast.
| It's rather a fast-moving story, not
, 100 exciting, though, about two pro-
I fessional gold-diggers who live by
entertaining the wealthy out-of
town clients of a friend in business.
; After thus spent, one of them gold
i digs $52,000 in one lump, and the
' other falls in love. Complications in
| crease when handsome Joel Mcßae
! decides that Kay is only "working"
jhim, and walk's out of the picture,
! logically, of course, returning in the
I fade-out to beg forgiveness. Eugene
' Pallette adds a deal of riotous hu
| mor, playing the "funny-man-tight
i wad from Michigan." And, privately,
Iwe tip our hat to the gold-twins'
I darky mind. —M.L.J.
| President Cosgrave of the Irish
j Free State has issued an appeal to
the people of his country to buy
| home manufactured goods when
! possible, and after that to purchase
I British goods.
