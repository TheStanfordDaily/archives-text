j IT'S A SAD, stid story.
Bill Spaulding's U.C.L.A. Bruins,
| who served warning in the Stanford
' game that they were beginning to
i "arrive" in Pacific Coast competi
tion, yesterday completed the work
| begun by the Olympic Club last
i Sunday.
The club gave Pat Frayne a severe
headache when it handed the Gaels
their first trouncing of the season,
but it could still be said that the
Moraga eleven was undefeated in
intercollegiate competition.
The Bruins fixed that. They fixed
. it to the tune of 12 to 0, definitely
! bursting the St. Mary's bubble and
! removing any lingering doubts that
l the Westwood eleven is out of the
set-up class.

KENNEY AFFLERBAUGII,
moved from right to left half,
will work at his new post against
Nevada Saturday and probably
will stay in for most of the con
test to become acquainted with
his new duties for the Big Game.
Spud Hardy, who has been
substituting so well for Moffatt
all season, may or may not start
in the big fracas. Ernie Caddel
is certain to start at right half,
and Warner may intend to pair
hiin with Afflerbaugh because
of the latter's punting.
Meanwhile Caddel demon
strated in the U.S.C. encounter
that he can carry the kicking
load if necessary. Both Hardy
and Afflerbaugh turned in fine

games against Troy, and be
tween them should take good
care of Moffatt's post a week
from Saturday.
MAX BAER, the Livormore
butcher boy, seems back on the high
road to success in the heavyweight
ranks. He started all over again
Monday night when he stopped
Johnny Risko, one of the toughest
"trial horses" in the business. Risko
was one of the several who trounced
Max on his disastrous invasion ot'
the East some time ago.
Nov/ Baer is seeking to wipe out
another defeat, at the hands of Les
Kennedy. Kennedy outboxed ihe
Livermore boy in a big upset at
Los Angeles during Max's first rise.
Louis Parente, Oakland promoter, is
dickering for a return match.

j IT'S A SAD, stid story.
Bill Spaulding's U.C.L.A. Bruins,
| who served warning in the Stanford
' game that they were beginning to
i "arrive" in Pacific Coast competi
tion, yesterday completed the work
| begun by the Olympic Club last
i Sunday.
The club gave Pat Frayne a severe
headache when it handed the Gaels
their first trouncing of the season,
but it could still be said that the
Moraga eleven was undefeated in
intercollegiate competition.
The Bruins fixed that. They fixed
. it to the tune of 12 to 0, definitely
! bursting the St. Mary's bubble and
! removing any lingering doubts that
l the Westwood eleven is out of the
set-up class.

KENNEY AFFLERBAUGII,
moved from right to left half,
will work at his new post against
Nevada Saturday and probably
will stay in for most of the con
test to become acquainted with
his new duties for the Big Game.
Spud Hardy, who has been
substituting so well for Moffatt
all season, may or may not start
in the big fracas. Ernie Caddel
is certain to start at right half,
and Warner may intend to pair
hiin with Afflerbaugh because
of the latter's punting.
Meanwhile Caddel demon
strated in the U.S.C. encounter
that he can carry the kicking
load if necessary. Both Hardy
and Afflerbaugh turned in fine

games against Troy, and be
tween them should take good
care of Moffatt's post a week
from Saturday.
MAX BAER, the Livormore
butcher boy, seems back on the high
road to success in the heavyweight
ranks. He started all over again
Monday night when he stopped
Johnny Risko, one of the toughest
"trial horses" in the business. Risko
was one of the several who trounced
Max on his disastrous invasion ot'
the East some time ago.
Nov/ Baer is seeking to wipe out
another defeat, at the hands of Les
Kennedy. Kennedy outboxed ihe
Livermore boy in a big upset at
Los Angeles during Max's first rise.
Louis Parente, Oakland promoter, is
dickering for a return match.
