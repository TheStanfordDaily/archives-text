## Marauding Moragans Lose First Intercollegiate Game This Year 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11. (P.1.P.)
â€”Westwood's "five-year plan" ma
terialized a bit early today when
the U.C.L.A. Bruins passed their
way to a spectacular 12-0 victory
over St. Mary's before a crowd of
approximately 40.000. Proceeds of
the game went to charity.
Charging out on a field made slip
pery by a brief shower, the Bruins,
long the doormat of the Pacific Coast
Conference, jumped into an early
lead which ultimately gave the
Southerners the distinction of being
the first college team to defeat
Madigan's men this year.
Goal Line Crumbles
The Northern Gael degenerated
inlo a mere bluster before the coun
ter aerial attack of the Bruin back
field, while the Gaul line crumbled
before the West wood defense.
A tumble by Toscani on the St.
Mary's 20-yard line gave U.C.L.A.
a chance to score after only three
minutes of play. The Southern team
made 7 yards on three plays and
then Bergdahl passed 9 yards to
Decker who crossed the line stand
ing up.
After Duncan's try for conversion
was blocked, the Gaels and Gauls
galloped to the Bruin 4-yard line
only to be held on downs. A few
plays later U.C.L.A. pushed to mid
field from which point Bergdahl shot
a pass to Wellendorf 25 yards down
the field who leaped high in the air
to snatch the oval from two St.
Mary's defenders and run untouched
to the goal line. Duncan's kick was
again blocked and U.C.L.A. led, 12-0.
Launch Wild Attack
St. Mary's opened the third quar
ter with a running and passing at
tack, but the Bruin 30-yard line
was as far as the Red and Blue
could advance. As the game drew
to a close, the desperate Gaels
launched a wild pass attack, but the
Bruins played.a conservative and
effective defense game to bottle up
the St. Mary's offense.
