# RADIO DEBATE WITH HARVARD NOVEMBER 27
## Each Speaker To Give Two Ten-Minute Speeches And Rebuttal DEBATE 11:30 TO 12:30 First Forensic Contest On Nationwide Scale 
### 
Culminating negotiations under j
way since early last spring, debaters !
of Stanford and Harvard will par
ticipate in a transcontinental radio j
debate on Friday, November 27. In >
what promises to be a history-mak- j
ing epoch in American forensic cir- j
cles, the two colleges will represent j
the extreme borders of the United j
States and bring to the radio public ;
the first inter-collegiate contest on j
a nation-wide scale.
Morning Broadcast
Through the efforts of the Harvard j
Debate Council, originators of the |
idea, the Columbia Broadcasting j
System will give one hour of its j
time on all allied stations for the i
broadcast. The time donated is 11:30 |
to 12:30 a.m., Pacific Standard Time. ;
There is no commerce attachment to j
the proposition. Effort of Philip
Cohen and George Oest, initiators j
of the idea, to secure Stanford as j
the Western contender was the re
sult of the opinion held for repre
sentatives of Stanford who, several !
years ago, gave proof of the high !
standards controlling debating in |
this college.
Two speeches of ten minutes' du- t
ration and rebuttals of five minutes {
will be given by each college. The t
question for consideration is: "Re- i
solved, that America needs a strong
er central government." Speakers |
lor Stanford will be chosen after j
the California contests Tuesday eve- j
ning with emphasis placed on choice i
of the two with the best speaking i
voices. Debate Coach J. G. Emerson, j
with the coaching staff assisting him, !
will choose the two speakers. The j
Stanford men will speak from San J
Francisco and the Harvard team !
from Boston.
Forensic History
"This debate will undoubtedly i
become the precedent for such con- j
tests in the future," is the opinion
of John Gange, debate manager. ]
"Debates over the radio have proven j
successful in hook-ups as far west i
as Chicago, but this is the first on j
a transcontinental scale. Stanford j
was fortunate in being rated so high j
by the Eastern school and deserves !
such recognition through the efforts j
of the 'team that debated in Boston j
â– three years ago and the showing ,
made by Robert McClintock as a '
member of the All-California team
of invaders into Boston two years j
ago."
With the date set coming during j
Thanksgiving recess of Stanford,
many students, who might not .
otherwise be able to, may listen to j
the broadcast.
