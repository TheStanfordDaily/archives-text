# Last Day For Roble And Senior Photos
## 
### 
To meet the demand for one more
opportunity to pose for Quad photo
graphs, yearbook officials have set
aside today as a last chance for all
seniors and all Roble Club members
to arrange for sittings.
Photographs will be taken at the
Watson Studios across the street
from the Press Building between the
hours 9 to 12 and 1 to 4:30 o'clock.
About 70 Roble women have yet to
have their photographs taken.
Morning hours are advised as of-
fering faster service. A charge of
50 cents is made to all Roble Club
members while the charge to seniors
is $1.50, which may be applied to the
purchase of a Quad at $7. Seniors
possessing Quad receipts are re-
quested to bring them to the studio
when they come to be photographed.
Photography of fraternity men
will start Monday with members of
Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Alpha Sigma Phi, and Al-
pha Tau Omega listed for the first
day.
BSrry Wood, Harvard quarter
back, is one of the most gifted ath
letes of all time. In addition to foot
ball, his skill is exceptional in ten
nis, baseball, golf, billiards, and
basketball.
