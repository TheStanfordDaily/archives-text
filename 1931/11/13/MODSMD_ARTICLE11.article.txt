# RALLYMEN WAGER LIDS ON RESULTS OF CAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Since the administration has
forbidden the removal of the
famous Axe from its safe, quiet
resting place in a steel-ribbed
bank vault, the Stanford and
California rally committees
have literally tossed their hats
into the ring as trophies for the
mighty Battle of the Century.
Farm statisticians have fig
ured out the odds in the col
lective bet of the two commit
tees to be about 3.7835 to 1 in
favor of Stanford, because of
the theoi-etical superiority of
Ihe Red over the Blue. This
figure is backed up by the tele
phoned statement of a Daily
Californian representative last
night, who declared the Bears
were asking for at least two to
one on Stanford before risking
their shekels. He added that
about the only thing left for
the boys over there to do, now
that the Axe is in cold storage,
is to set off the Big Game bon
fire ahead of time.
Oh, yeah?
