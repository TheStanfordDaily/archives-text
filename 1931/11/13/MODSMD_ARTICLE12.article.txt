"If America is Ihe most criminal
j country of the earth—and it is—if
l the laws are most poorly enforced,
! justice most weakly administered —
i and they are — the reprehensible
i treatment of officers of the law is a
large contributing cause," he said.

-1 plain of official efficiency. Never are
I the guilty satisfied with official
