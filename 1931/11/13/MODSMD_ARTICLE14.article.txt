It pays to be ambitious; but to
I yodel "Come Join the Band' and]
wear a Blue and Gold dink is quite ;
another thing- In spite of warnings,
! objections, and other matters of lit
tle importance, one freshman, Carter |
Meyer, has decided to do just this.
| In fact, young Meyer has attained
(he rather dubious accomplishment !
of attending both Stanford and the ,
home of the Golden Bear at one and 1
the same time. That is, figuratively ;
speaking.
During the week, for five joyful
j days, "Doc" Meyer survives the rig- [
j 01s of the traditional freshman!

courses ;evcn the much-publicized
[subject crudely dubbed "Citizen-
I ship." But Friday evening seems to
! place him in a peculiar cftlemna, for
he attends the San Francisco Exten
sion Bureau of the University of
| California, where he is a regularly
i enrolled student of dramatics.
Be it treason, or be it not so ... â€¢
! in spite of many attempts upon his
, body and person the weekly act is
i still being carried out to the letter.
It i;-> even probable that many of the
scenes of the next act in Meyer's life
I of innocent treachery will be laid
j down on the Farm and directed by
' irate Indian boar-hunters.
