# NIGHT AND DAY BONFIRE LABOR STARTS TODAY
## Firewood Will Ultimately Assume Shape Of Campanile 
### 
Work on the Campanile was be
gun yesterday at noon by a steadily
augmented number of enterprising
frosh, Bill Werder announced last
night. Eight huge telephone poles
were driven in by P. G. & E. crews
and pits were constructed to furnish
the draft underneath the giant pyre.
Laboring long after dusk last eve-
the workers were aided by
four powerful floodlights installed at
the top of additional poles set away
from the gigantic bonfire which will
ultimately reach a height of 70 feet
or more. Wood and fuel for the
blaze kept arriving in a constant
stream all day, and an excellent
supply of railroad ties was received
from the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Guard Duty Begins
Actual guard duty will commence
tonight at 6 o'clock, when the first
shift of twenty men under present
Marvie Kahn will take up the work
until 10 o'clock this evening. Under
the light supplied by the floods, it
is probable that construction work
will continue until 11 o'clock every
night until Tuesday besides this
duty, Kahn and Werder stated.
The second shift will come on at
10 o'clock with 30 men to stand the
vigil until 2 a.m., when they will be
relieved by another crew of that
Size to serve until 6 o'clock in the
morning, it was revealed. Men vol
unteering for the 6 p.m. shift will
be served dinner at 5:30 o'clock,
Kahn added.
Late Shifts Fed
The second and third shifts will
be fed coffee and doughnuts during
the long hours of the night, by a
committee under the direction of
Mary Lou James. The entire fresh
man football squad will guard the
mock Campanile and bonfire from
the ravages of an expected attempt
to set it off prematurely by the Cali
fornia freshmen, the leaders an
nounced.
The Millbrae Dairy has offered to
furnish cream for the coffee, which
will be supplied by the Hills Bros,
plant, Mary Lou James said. Sand
wiches will be made by the sorority
houses and Roble, and the fraterni
ties are scheduled to contribute the
necessary doughnuts for the occa
sion. The A.S.S.U. has offered to
donate a suitable amount of sugar
for the coffee.
At a meeting last night of the
frosh in Encina lobby, the plans
arranged by the committee in charge
were outlined to the workers. Lists
were posted in the lobby for volun
teers to sign up for the nights and
hours they prefer 1o serve on guard
duty. Those who do not volunteer
will be drafted, according to Marvie
Kahn.

four powerful floodlights installed at
the top of additional poles set away
from the gigantic bonfire which will
ultimately reach a height of 70 feet
or more. Wood and fuel for the
blaze kept arriving in a constant
stream all day, and an excellent
supply of railroad ties was received
from the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Guard Duty Begins
Actual guard duty will commence
tonight at 6 o'clock, when the first
shift of twenty men under present
Marvie Kahn will take up the work
until 10 o'clock this evening. Under
the light supplied by the floods, it
is probable that construction work
will continue until 11 o'clock every
night until Tuesday besides this
duty, Kahn and Werder stated.
The second shift will come on at
10 o'clock with 30 men to stand the
vigil until 2 a.m., when they will be
relieved by another crew of that
Size to serve until 6 o'clock in the
morning, it was revealed. Men vol
unteering for the 6 p.m. shift will
be served dinner at 5:30 o'clock,
Kahn added.
Late Shifts Fed
The second and third shifts will
be fed coffee and doughnuts during
the long hours of the night, by a
committee under the direction of
Mary Lou James. The entire fresh
man football squad will guard the
mock Campanile and bonfire from
the ravages of an expected attempt
to set it off prematurely by the Cali
fornia freshmen, the leaders an
nounced.
The Millbrae Dairy has offered to
furnish cream for the coffee, which
will be supplied by the Hills Bros,
plant, Mary Lou James said. Sand
wiches will be made by the sorority
houses and Roble, and the fraterni
ties are scheduled to contribute the
necessary doughnuts for the occa
sion. The A.S.S.U. has offered to
donate a suitable amount of sugar
for the coffee.
At a meeting last night of the
frosh in Encina lobby, the plans
arranged by the committee in charge
were outlined to the workers. Lists
were posted in the lobby for volun
teers to sign up for the nights and
hours they prefer 1o serve on guard
duty. Those who do not volunteer
will be drafted, according to Marvie
Kahn.
Work on the Campanile was be
gun yesterday at noon by a steadily
augmented number of enterprising
frosh, Bill Werder announced last
night. Eight huge telephone poles
were driven in by P. G. & E. crews
and pits were constructed to furnish
the draft underneath the giant pyre.
Laboring long after dusk last eve-
the workers were aided by
four powerful floodlights installed at
the top of additional poles set away
