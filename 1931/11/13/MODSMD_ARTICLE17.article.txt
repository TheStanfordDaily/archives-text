# Rally Leader Attacked As Cruel Fiend
## Protest Sent Against Use Of Bear For Meat 
### 
Stanford's Rally Committee is an
organization of cruel, barbaric
| fiends, capable of the most heinous
i of crimes, and arch-enemies of the
S.P.C.A.
1 This is the gist of a letter received
yesterday by Ed Boyles, Rally
Chairman, from Mrs. Bruce Joyce
of San Mateo, protesting the use of
1 Bozo the bear in the Big Game
Rally Wednesday. Bozo, a half
! grown cub, is being sent to the
| campus by Ancil Robertson, Class
of '00, from the northern part of the
| state. The complete letter follows:
Dear Mr. Boyles:
I have just read in today's
paper that you plan to have a
live bear at your Big Game rally
' and I just know you plan to
desecrate it in some manner.
I truly can imagine nothing
more heinous or barbaric to be
presented before an audience of
intelligent people than the spec
tacle of a poor dumb animal
being taunted by an unmerci
ful crowd of horrid, howling
I Stanford roughs. »
Can't you be humane and give
Bozo to the kiddies of Palo Alto
or San Mateo? I can just see
him, with his soft brown eyes
glowing with happiness — calm
and ' contented and surrounded
by laughing children. I know
someone will provide a home
for him. And if you are not
kind to Bozo, young man, far
be it from me to thi'eaten, but
just remember I am a member
of the S.P.C.A. and certain San
Mateo women's clubs.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Bruce Joyce
San Mateo, Calif.
'"This implication that Stanford
I men must have decisions made for
! them like high school children goes
i a bit too far," Boyles declared last
night. "I have presented this letter
j to the Daily with the hope that
i every' student will make his own
i judgment of the sender.
"We will continue with our origi
nal plans and feature Bozo on the
| stage at the rally, and if the team
i gets hungry for bear steaks, there is
| that possibility."
Charlie Karl, chairman of the Big
: Game rally, anounccd last night that
I balloons will be distributed in the
women's rooting section at the game,
and will be liberated on signal at
j half time.
It has also been decided, he said,
to put red and white pompons on
sale in the A.S.S.U. office Wednes
day. All women rooters arc asked
to purchase them for the game. The
i price will be 15 cents.
! Tickets for the rally, which will
I begin in the Pavilion at 7:30 o'clock,
j arc available for outsiders only in
! the A.S.S.U. and Alumni offices,
i Boyles stated. Persons holding these
I cardhoards will be admitted at 7
1 o'clock.
I Complete plans for the rally pro-
J gram will' be announced the first of

1 This is the gist of a letter received
yesterday by Ed Boyles, Rally
Chairman, from Mrs. Bruce Joyce
of San Mateo, protesting the use of
1 Bozo the bear in the Big Game
Rally Wednesday. Bozo, a half
! grown cub, is being sent to the
| campus by Ancil Robertson, Class
of '00, from the northern part of the
| state. The complete letter follows:
Dear Mr. Boyles:
I have just read in today's
paper that you plan to have a
live bear at your Big Game rally
' and I just know you plan to
desecrate it in some manner.
I truly can imagine nothing
more heinous or barbaric to be
presented before an audience of
intelligent people than the spec
tacle of a poor dumb animal
being taunted by an unmerci
ful crowd of horrid, howling
I Stanford roughs. »
Can't you be humane and give
Bozo to the kiddies of Palo Alto
or San Mateo? I can just see
him, with his soft brown eyes
glowing with happiness — calm
and ' contented and surrounded
by laughing children. I know
someone will provide a home
for him. And if you are not
kind to Bozo, young man, far
be it from me to thi'eaten, but
just remember I am a member
of the S.P.C.A. and certain San
Mateo women's clubs.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Bruce Joyce
San Mateo, Calif.
