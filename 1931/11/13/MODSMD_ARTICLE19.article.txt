pOP WARNER and his Indian gridders will breathe easily tomorrow.
After a week of light work, the Redskins will tangle with Nevada in
(he Stadium tomorrow afternoon in the first real "breather" of the season.
The U.C.L.A. game was supposed to be one, but the Bruins had different
ideas. The Wolf Pack, however, has shown little to instill fear into the
heart of the susceptible Warner, and the reserves are expected to hold the
fort without aid from the first string. The game should be interesting in
that it will show the possibilities of a number of men who will he candi
dates for next year's varsity. Pop is expected to take full advantage of the

to experiment with his re
| serves, as in the West Coast Army
' opener.
Bill Bates, who showed up well
I in Tuesday night's scrimmage, will
be closely watched for his work at
! center, while Jack Hillman is ex
-11 pected to attract attention in the
backfield. Jack, younger brother of
| Captain Harry Hillman, appears to
have the makings of a good full
back, and has two years of compe
' ■ tition ahead of him.
AfTlcrbaugh to Play
i AfTlcrbaugh is the only one of to-
, morrow's opening eleven who has a
i chance to start in the Big Game
! next Saturday. Moved from right to
i left half to reinforce the position
; left vacant by the injury of Phil
I i MofTatt, Warner is using him against
, the Wolf Pack to accustom him to
, i his new post.
• | If Afflerbaugh makes a good
, | showing tomorrow, there is a pos
sibility that he will start against the
, | Boars in place of Spud Hardy, regu
. lar MofTatt understudy. Afiier
, baugh's chief advantage over Hardy
. j is his punting.
Ned Clark, whom Warner shifted
to right end after the injury of Tod
in the U.S.C. game, will be unable
to play tomorrow because of an
| elbow injury he received in Tues
| day's scrimmage. It is expected that
{ he will be ready for the Big Game,
I but his injury will prevent him from
working out at his new position
against Nevada.
Baker Back
i Phil Baker, Captain Hillman's un
! derstudy, was back in uniform last
i night after several days in the hos
j pital with boils. Bill Corbus, the
| "baby-faced assassin," was also out
of the hospital, but did not work out.
Phil MofTatt hobbled out to watch
; the practice, still displaying a pro
; nounced limp.
Serious preparation for the Big
i Game will not begin until next week
! when the secret practice sign will
;igain be nailed on the practice field
| gate.
j With most of the first string in
! uniform yesterday. Warner again
I sent the squad through a reasonably
light workout featured by signal
drills on the dummy machines.
