# MORE DEPRESSION DANCES
## 
### 
That a sophomore cotillion and a depression dance
cannot occupy the same week-end was indicated last night
when the depression dance was called off. The reason
given was that the prospect of a cheaper dance on the fol
lowing night would seriously interfere with the success of
the cotillion.
However, since the success of any dance depends on
the number of bids sold, it is hard to see how publicity
given as late as Thursday can affect a Friday night dance.
The only possibility would be bids turned in for a refund,
;:i!(! according to student officials this would occur in a
large enough quantity to warrant calling off the Saturday
night dance. This seemingly indicates that the Stanford
rough would telephone his date on Thursday and suggest
that they go out Saturday night and forego the traditional
sophomore cotillion. That sounds ridiculous.
The fact that everyone has supported the past depres
sion dances indicates their popularity and there was a pos
sibility that if the students so desired, the Women's Ath
letic Association would sponsor regular depression dances
for the rest of this quarter and next. This may still be
done, but the action taken in not allowing this one to go
through lias not furthered the chances for bigger and bet
ter depression dances.
