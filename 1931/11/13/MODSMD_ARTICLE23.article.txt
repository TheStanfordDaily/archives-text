# THE 						AXE AGAIN
## 
### 
A fervid plea for a public display of the Stanford Axe
is- printed in the Campus Opinion column of today's paper.
The writer urges that the Axe be brought out at the Big
Game and paraded in front of the very jaws of a growling
Golden Hear.
At first sight this idea seems excellent. Why shouldn't
the Indian rooters throw out their chest and swagger be
fore the Blue and Gold rooting section, bearing that lnueh
iought-over weapon? That would make the Hear squirm
and snarl, wouldn't it?
But viewed in a saner light, the proposition is out of the
question. Of course, Stanford is proud of the recovery of
the Axe and proud of the "21" who carried.il off from
under the very noses of, the California guardians.
Hut the time is not yet ripe for bringing out the Axe.
Flaunting it before its erstwhile possessors would only
bend close to the breaking point the already strained ath
letic relations between the two schools.
There is too much to be risked for so little gain in tak
ing the Axe out of the vault this year. Stanford would be
risking the chance to take its yearly crack at California on
(lie gridiron for the rather empty purpose of teasing the
Bear.
After all, Stanford would be a pretty dreary place fall
quarter without the Big Game.
