The by-products of the depression arc many. From the
manager of the (Chamber of Commerce of Honolulu comes
this urgent statement:
"Hawaii is facing a serious problem in the numbers of
capable women from the universities on the west coast
who are coming here primarily seeking stenographic posi
tions and without sutlicienl funds to keep them while they
are unable to find work here.
"The business depression lias not affected these islands
as il has elsewhere; tourists and residents write to friends
that business is not seriously affected. Naturally these sen
timents attract people who have been struggling through a
period of financial stress. This is especially true in the
case of unattached young women who have enough money
for their fare over but with little margin of safety.
"We cannot stress too strongly that there are no posi
tions in Hawaii just now in any vocation, except in extreme
situations. All available positions can be filled from our
local supply."
11 is not the purpose to rub off any of the glamour or
atmosphere of adventure and novelty that rightfully be
longs to Hawaii. Hut optimistic, adventurous college
women, who are under the impression that Hawaii is still
the land of opportunity, should look the hard cold facts
given in the above statement in the face, before launching
themselves improvidentially and disastrously forth to
I lawaii.
