# BULL SESSION
## AROUND THE CORNER 
### 
When the stock market broke
about two years ago and proved
that America cannot defy economic
laws; when the party of prosperity
found itself without any prosperity
and with much less of a party due
to not having prosperity, there has
sprung up all over the country
great groups of prophets. These in
dividuals clearly proved that good
times wete just around the corner.
Some of the more enthusiastic even
went so far as to say how far it was
to the coiner. Most, however, con
tented themselves with vague gener
alities.
But after the much-heralded pros
perity failed to materialize, a new
stage in explaining the depression
was manifested. The poor business
conditions were due to poor psych
ology. The big trouble was that peo
ple were too pessimistic; if people
would only concentrate on the
doughnut and not the hole, if people
would only stop thinking depression,
the thing would lade into the thin
air from which it came.
The idea seemed good. Psychology
has a wonderful hold on people;
perhaps, this new scientific magic
could cure the situation. As a re
sult, there swept over the Rotary
and other service clubs, the smiling
dispensers of the depression. They
tried to make the business men
laugh their troubles away; but the
merchants didn't feel that way. They
still had to pay rent and salaries
without selling the goods. The myth

'that the depression was psychologi
; cal suddenly collapsed. It left its
stamp on the situation, however.
! Maps wei'e put out showing eco
| nomic conditions throughout the
I United States which used such
| terms as good, fair, and quiet instead
|of terrible, unbearable, pediculous.
Recently, however, the last stage
I of rationalization has been reached,
j "There is no depression." Strange,
j that nobody thought of that before,
i It settles the whole problem with a
! brevity and a thoroughness that is
| unbeatable. It obviates any other
j plan with its sweeping program. One
I of the big radio tycoons issued the
j statement, "This is a shining" period
jof prosperity for the businessman
i who knows his business." Well,
| there are probably a lot of people
Ithat don't know their business then.
Mr. Coit blushingly admits in the
, article that his business is booming
! right along so that the obvious con
i elusion to be drawn is that he
i knows his business while all the
1 other great executives throughout
the land who have been forced to
| stop dividends, fire employees, and
j show reduced income returns are
; ignorant of the workings of their
j particular undertakings.
Eut no matter what statements
j are made to the press, the people
I now realize that it will be some
! time before they go around the cor
; ner and sit under the trees of boom
j prosperity and listen to the sweet
j warbling of the increased income
1 birds. â€”Abe Mellinkoff
