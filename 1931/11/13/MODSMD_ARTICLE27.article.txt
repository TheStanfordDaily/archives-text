THE CREAM OF JESTERS—Edited
by J. B. Mussey. Albert and
Charles Boni. 1931. (At the Stan
ford Bookstore. 53.)
Here is a collection of all those
clever things in magazines that you
! meant to clip but didn't. Humorous
articles and poems, satirical sketeh
j es, and "the New Yorker" type of
| cartoons are saved here for pos
| terity. This book is that rarity—a
! justifiable anthology.
Don't be led astray by the blurb
I on the jacket, which announces "a
i collection of the best American wit
| and humor." There are no whimsical
j articles by Washington Irving or
; drawings of the Gibson girls. Every
thing has been written recently by
1 the type of author you read after
; the library closes—Milt Gross, Ring
: Lardner, Robert Benchley, Ogden
Nash, Dorothy Parker, Will Rogers.
The drawings are by Gluyas Wil
j liams, Peter Arno, John Held, Jr.,
i O. Soglow, and others.
i "The Treasurer's Report" by Rob
i ert Benchley is alone worth the
j price of admission. —R.M.
FOUR HANDSOME NEGRESSES—
By R. Hernekin Baptist. Jonathan
Cape and Harrison Smith. New
York, 1931. $2.00. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
In a history of early Portuguese
I trading and travels, mention was
1 made of four young negresses who
| were taken aboard on one of the
first voyages, and left at different
| stops along the African coast—this
| bare statement, and nothing more.
The author of this novel here tells
' his story of what happened to each
of the four women, Regeunda, Ari
gacho, Sapi, and Azize.
The fate of each of the four is
| equally depressing in its stark naked

' ness—each one mistreated fearfully
j until death relieves hc«. But the
! feeling of the whole thing is beuuti
; ful and comprehending. The author
; has something definitely different.
; His treatment of the innocence and
j modesty of the primitive savage, and
| of the effect of so-called civilization
! upon it, is a thing to be considered
I seriously. —M.L.J.

THE CREAM OF JESTERS—Edited
by J. B. Mussey. Albert and
Charles Boni. 1931. (At the Stan
ford Bookstore. 53.)
Here is a collection of all those
clever things in magazines that you
! meant to clip but didn't. Humorous
articles and poems, satirical sketeh
j es, and "the New Yorker" type of
| cartoons are saved here for pos
| terity. This book is that rarity—a
! justifiable anthology.
Don't be led astray by the blurb
I on the jacket, which announces "a
i collection of the best American wit
| and humor." There are no whimsical
j articles by Washington Irving or
; drawings of the Gibson girls. Every
thing has been written recently by
1 the type of author you read after
; the library closes—Milt Gross, Ring
: Lardner, Robert Benchley, Ogden
Nash, Dorothy Parker, Will Rogers.
The drawings are by Gluyas Wil
j liams, Peter Arno, John Held, Jr.,
i O. Soglow, and others.
i "The Treasurer's Report" by Rob
i ert Benchley is alone worth the
j price of admission. —R.M.

By R. Hernekin Baptist. Jonathan
Cape and Harrison Smith. New
York, 1931. $2.00. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
In a history of early Portuguese
I trading and travels, mention was
1 made of four young negresses who
| were taken aboard on one of the
first voyages, and left at different
| stops along the African coast—this
| bare statement, and nothing more.
The author of this novel here tells
' his story of what happened to each
of the four women, Regeunda, Ari
gacho, Sapi, and Azize.
The fate of each of the four is
| equally depressing in its stark naked

' ness—each one mistreated fearfully
j until death relieves hc«. But the
! feeling of the whole thing is beuuti
; ful and comprehending. The author
; has something definitely different.
; His treatment of the innocence and
j modesty of the primitive savage, and
| of the effect of so-called civilization
! upon it, is a thing to be considered
I seriously. —M.L.J.
