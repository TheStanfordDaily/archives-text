Speaking of the Big Game,
girls and boys, we're betting our
lasf plugged Canadian dime J
that it's still very much worth
seeing. Personally, we're nnx- i
ious to see Bozo, the bear that
that Siskiyou County alumnus
is sending down, Only it would
be so much nicer if they'd leave
him whole and unbarbecued,
after the rally. Maybe we could
add him to our family of ofilcc
pets. How about it, Mr. Boyles?
Here we all are, tearing our wigs |
frantically and acquiring everything I
from blisters to splinters in. the cause
of ye Big Game Bonfire—in capital
letters, a capital idea, and a swell (
campanile to cap the pyre. Just j
once a year we have a chance to
express power and all the strength f
that isn't used up in football. Ii
only the maniacs who set things off
too soon will stay out of the way, !
everything will be—what is it you ;
Americans say — er — hunkydory
Another vote of thanks, today.
Speaking of the depression re
minded us that no matter how
hard the times seem to be, our
old friend Iloos Bros, is not cut
ting down cm its wages, or its
advertising, or anything . . .
And seeing as how advertising
is pretty important to us, and
even a newspaper stali appre
ciates people who look dressed
and not just slung together, we
take our hats off to them.
(That's the third time my wrist
has cracked this week! Such j
stuff!)
The sophomore class has bribed ,
us to say thai we think Spain is a !
swell country (being Burmese, our- i
self). Anyhow, Spanish atmosphere j
is quite the thing for a romantic I
occasion like the Cotillion, tonight. I
Brunettes will obviously be much in '
demand; and Windjammer has ar- j
ranged for a census taker to keep 1
track of imports and home products. !
We're going to clear up the Mills i
College myth once and for all. Go ;
to it, ladies!
Last paragraph, and every
body out! End of the line! And
if you're very, very good we'll
see you along with the rest of
Nevada at the game tomorrow,
and tell you ail about why a
grass widow is known as the
wife of a dead vegetarian.
Thank you.
