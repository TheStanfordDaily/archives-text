# GIVE 'EM THE AXE

### 
The Editor, Sir:
At the U.S.C. Horse Rally last
; week one of the speakers mentioned, |
l among other things, the fact that
Stanford must lick the Trojans in '
i order to make the southern part of
! this state a safe place for Stanford
| people. 1 guess Southern California ,
| is still unsafe for us. But that doesn't I
worry me because 1 never go to the
! southern part of this state. I
i am finding it very unsafe for me
! and other Stanfordites to wander >
I around the northern parts of Cali- :
] fornia. And by that I mean the I
Golden Bear and the Stanford Axe. ,
Ever since that night nineteen
: months ago when Stanford got the
j axe back, those Berkeleians have
1 asked me why Stanford doesn't bring
; the Axe out. And that question has
I popped up too frequently lately. In

j fact they have accused us of being
afraid and being poor sports.
Why don't we bring the Axe out?
Are we afraid? If twenty-one Stan
ford men can get the Axe away
from the U.C. student body, our stu
dent body should be able to keep it.
! Certainly we can guard it for a few
hours against whatever brains or
beef U.C. can offer.
; Just as a suggestion may I offer
i the following:
That we have the Axe at the Big
i Game rally next week;
That we have the Axe in our
rooting section at the Big Game;
That we take the Axe and wave it
| in front of the U.C. rooting section
I after the game (assuming we win
1 the game;
That we get the Axe safely back
; to the bank;
That the Rally Committee send a
| formal notice to tho U.C. Daily
I telling those Bears that we WILL
I have the Axe out.
If we can't bring the Axe out I
| should like to know just why be
cause I'm running out of alibis. And
if we don't bring it out, what good
i is it? Maybe it's part of the frozen
! assets of this country.

That we have the Axe in our
rooting section at the Big Game;
That we take the Axe and wave it
| in front of the U.C. rooting section
I after the game (assuming we win
1 the game;
That we get the Axe safely back
; to the bank;
That the Rally Committee send a
| formal notice to tho U.C. Daily
I telling those Bears that we WILL
I have the Axe out.
If we can't bring the Axe out I
| should like to know just why be
cause I'm running out of alibis. And
if we don't bring it out, what good
i is it? Maybe it's part of the frozen
! assets of this country.
