rOLO FANS will be given an ,
early season treat this afternoon, j
when Captain K. A. Gordan will ■
send his Indian riders against the I
crack Menlo Circus club.
Of particular interest will be j
the appearance of Willie Tevis
aL the key No. 3 positions for
the Menlo quartet. Tevis has a
handicap rating of six goals, be- j
ing the best player on the .pe
ninsula and one of the leaders j
on (lie coast.
There are only about 50 players j
in the country who rate six goals j
or better, with Tommy Hitchcock at I
the top of the list, the only 10-goal j
man in the United States and one of \
two in the world.
The club four has a 15-goal han
dicap and will give the Indians 10
or II goals. This is the first start j
of the season for the Farm quartet, i
which Captain Gordan believes has i
greater possibilities than last year's j
strong organization.
BILL INGRAM is faccd with
tlit* same proposition tomorrow |
tiiat Pop Warner was two weeks
ago. He finds a "breather" be
fore the Big Ciame suddenly
grown up, just as Fop found a
battle on his hands in subduing
U.C.L.A. the week before the
Trojan affair.
Taking no chances of running
into trouble against Idaho, In
grain will start his first string
lineu p.
Another indication that this
coast conference is getting
tougher and tougher was shown
liy Idaho's stand against Wash
ington Stale last week, when the
Vandals held last year's cham
pions to a !)-S score.
WHILE STANFORD and Califor
nia have a week to go before the
Big Game, the two big fracases of
the north will be played tomorrow,
when Washington and Washington
State will meet at Seattle, and Ore
gon and Oregon State tangle at Eu
gene.
All four teams have been defeated
in conference play, and all will be
battling to salvage their seasons by
victories over their traditional op
ponents, just as will be the case
here next week. The Washington
teams are about evenly matched,
while Oregon State appears to have
an advantage over Oregon.
Oregon State has made far better
showings against common opponents
than has Oregon, but the flashes of
power shown by the latetr against
Washington and New York Univer
sity make tomorrow's game a hard
one to figure.
POF CALLS it a "toss-up."
Bill Ingram says, "They've got
it on us."
Howard Jones, who should
know if anybody should, says in
effect, "I dunno."
All of which is the most expert
"dope" available at the present on
the Big Game.
It is interesting to note the tac
tics of Ingram. At the first of the
season, when the Bears needed en
couragement, he was optimistic. As
soon as they did something to be en
couraged about, he promptly became
pessimistic.
Compai alive scores give California
a 13-point advantage over the In
dians, but Navy Bill lalks of Stan
ford's superior material and says,
"We've no right to be made favor
ites."
If the Bears should crash through
in the Game this year, Ingram's
psychology will be largely respon
sifele.—L M. C.
