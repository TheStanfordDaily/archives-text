Plowing their way through 10 j
lengths of the Encina pool, a quar
tet of varsity swimmers yesterday
unofficially lowered the national in
tercollegiate record for the 400-yard |
relay by half a second, coming :
through in 3 minutes 39.3 seconds, t
None of the four, McKelvey, Booth, j
Wiget, or Gardner, were clocked at ;
more than 56:3 seconds, with Gard- |
ner negotiating the distance in 53:4. j
the best time he has ever made.
Starting oft with a fast man, Mc- ;
Kelvey, the first 100 yards was j
chalked up at 53:9, giving early J
promise of a record. Next came
Booth, who reeled of? the distance
in 56:3, releasing Wiget at the end
of his century. Cutting his way
through four fast lengths of the j
pool, Wiget finished in 55:7.
But the best was yet to come. |
Gardner plunged in and fairly 1
buined up the ripples to finish in j j
the very excellent time of 53:4, low
est of the four and the best he has j
ever done.
Michigan Has Record
The University of Michigan holds
the official record for the distance, i ;
at 3:39.8, a full half second slower j'
than the Cardinal effort yesterday. !'
Stanford holds the present Pacific j ,
Coast intercollegiate record of 3:54.4, j '
made March 7 in the California meet i '
by a team composed of John Trotter, j j
Dave Thomas, Paul de Silva, and j;
McKelvey. Needless to say, this rec - j ,
ord, and perhaps the national also. !
will fall next winter if everyone ,
performs as expected.
Assistant Coach Thornton consid
i ers yesterday's time not in the least '
; an unrepeatable performance, since
| McKelvey has done the 100 in 53:5,
! four-tenths of a second better than
I his yesterday's effort; Booth has j"
j swum the distance in 54 fiat, no less
j than 2.3 seconds better than his re- j
| hiy time, and 'Wiget has negotiated
| the century in 55 fiat, seven-tenths I
i faster than yesterday.
Future Bright
\ If all these men each swam the
i fastest of which they are capable,
j the record would thus be lowered to ]
jan astonishing figure. As it was, 1
j him to handle this herculean task
| very well. Price is blessed wiih a j
| fine pair of defensive hands, as im
j portant to a good tackle as good
i legs are to a chorus girl.
j The two greatest tackles in Army
j football history were undoubtedly j
Weyand and Devore, with Graves j
i and Pullen next. Where would the
j Oliphants, Dailys, Wilson's, Pritch
' ards, Cagles, and Frenches be if it j
j hadn't been for those, and other
; bone-crushing tackles who smeared j
j opposing forwards and broke up the
! enemy offensive formations? Big !
j boys like Price are the "Little Johns" \
â–  for the Robin Hocds in the baek
j field. The ball-carriers get the credit
| among hoi polioi, but John M. Price
is a ball player's player and his !
teammates and his opponents know
that he is the kick in that old Army ,
line.
