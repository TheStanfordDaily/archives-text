# CHINA WAR BOOMS ENGLISH TEXTILES

MANCHESTER. England, Nov. 12;
(/P).â€” The conflict between Japan
and China in Manchuria has eased
the plight of Lancashire textile I
workers. It has been the largest
factor in providing 40,000 mill work- (
ers with jobs and in putting 500,000 j
others on full time instead of part j
time. These benefits have resulted I
from the fact that the Chinese boy
cott has virtually stopped importa- .
tions of cotton into China from '
Japan.
The upswing in the textile dis- 1
trict has led the way for the rest of |
Great Britain. Unemployment has i
decreased steadily since early last !
month, largely because of the re- j
vival of cotton.
