# Price, Candidate for All-American Last Year, in Spite of Such Tackles as Sington and Edwards
## 
### 
"Price, John M. (Capt.) . . , .j i
position, tackle .... class, 1932
age, twenty-one .... weight, 225 j
.... school, Northwestern M. and j
N. Academy .... home, F«rt Dodge, :
lowa." Thus does the Army line-up, j
as printed in the football programs, '
give the facts on the leader of this j
year's Cadet eleven. Even last year j
when tackles like Sington of Ala- |
fcama, Edwards of Washington State,
Lubralovitch of Wisconsin, Vanßib
ber of Purdue, and Hugh Rea of i
Nebraska were roaming the grid- I
irons of the country, Johnny Price
received many votes as All-Ameri- i
can tackle. He should come into his
own this year, because of his fine
.play against Harvard and Yale, and
because I feel sure that, unless in
jured, he will do equally well against ;
; Pitt and Notre Dame.
j Last year Price had to support a
neighboring guard who was the
I weak spot in the Army line, as well
I as to fulfill his own tackle require- j
: ments, but his tremendous size, j
strength, speed, and fight enabled ;
i two of the four yesterday swam the I

distance in less than the present Pa
cific Coast intercollegiate record. It (
looks as though the Indians have a ,
little fun coming in the water next j
season! J
Regular time trials were held in ]
seven other events as well. In the ;
varsity 100-yard free style, Graves j
came through in 58:5 to win over
Knapp, a close second at 59 flat, and
Raven, who finished third at 62.
Other varsity results were: 100-yard
breast stroke: won by Harris, 1:16.7;
McGavern, second; McDowell, third;
Ber.et, fourth. 100-yard back stroke:
won by Tebbetts, 1:08.3; Wardwell,
second.
In the freshman events, Bill Rog
ers was outstanding in bettering his
own previous time of 1:50 in the 150-
| yard backstroke. His time yesterday
| was 1:48.5, a very definite improvc
i ment. Jimmy Tiiola, paced by Aus
tin Clapp. did the 220-yard free style
:in 2:29.8. Other freshman results:
I 50-yard free style: won by Taranik,
! 26:6; Hart, second, in the first heat.
'Second heat won by Hirsch, 28:1;
i Bpothe, second; Fry, third.
