# SING SING SQUAD TRIES DECEPTION IN GRID CLASSIC
## 
### 
OSSINING, N.Y., Nov. 12. I/P)
â€”The boys who would "die for
dear old Sing Sing" are going
to make their debut as a foot- j
ball team Sunday.
They are to meet the naval
militia on Sing Sing's brand
new football field, and there
will be a band on the sidelines
and movie cameras up in the
turrets where the sentries
stand.
But let any of the spectators
start thumbing their programs I
in search of the identity of
"No. 32," who made that whale
of a run for "good old jaii," and j
all they'll find is just another
number. |
