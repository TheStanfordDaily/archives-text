# Card Poloists Meet Menlo Riders Today
## Captain Tevis and a Fifteen Goal Team Handicap Make Circus Club Decided Favorites 
### 
IN THLIR first match of the season, the Stanford polo team meets the
flashy Menlo Circus Club at 3 o'clock today on the Encina field.
Polo fans will have the opportunity to watch an exceptionally fast team
in the Menlo aggregation. Well-mounted, and with the high rating of
15 goals, they are one of the best teams in northern California.
Stanford is distinctly in another category. No Stanford players have j
handicaps, so on the face of things, it would appear that the Cardinals are
to at least a 15-goal defeat.

Menlo Favored
"It's going to be a lot closer than !
! that, though," declared Captain
! Richard A. Gordan, polo mentor, j
I "Our boys have lots of fire, and if j
they play the way they are capable
: of playing, they ought to give the |
Menlo bunch a pretty good run." I
The Indians will be busy stopping
I Captain Tevis, No. 3 for Menlo. Tevis 1
i is a six-goal man and is probably
! the best player en the peninsula. '
j Two other brilliant Menlo players j
are J. M. and Angel Elizalde, who
| hail from the Manila Polo Club. Both !
j these men carry four-goal handi
j caps.
Four Goal Team
I It has not yet been decided what
handicap the Stanford team will be 1
| given. Since none of the players i
j have been officially handicapped,
l they must each carry one goal, mak- !
j ing a four-goal team for the Indians j
j as compared with the 15-goal rat- |
! in? of the Menlo club.
The referee will be Roscoe Am- !
; bier Curran of San Mateo. There ,
'will be no admission charge.
i The lineups of the two teams are !
