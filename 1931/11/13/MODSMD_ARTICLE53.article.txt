# CALIFORNIA GOOFS JOURNEY TO FARM FOR GRAY CLASH
## Bear Reverses Reported To Possess Powerful Squad This Year 
### 
With the kick-off scheduled at
11:30 Saturday morning in the Sta
dium, Stanford's Grays will tangle
with the California Goofs in the
preliminary to the varsity game.
This contest marks the peak of the
season for both teams and the two
squads usually play a smashing
game of ball, as the participants are
fighting for a bid to the varsity
squad next year.
Cal Unknown
The California reserves h.ive
played no games thus far in this
season and of course, making pre
dictions on their ability is a mighty
hazardous procedure. Bill Ingram
has retained a comparative small
varsity squad over at Berkeley this
year, and this fact indicates that a
number of good men have been
shunted down to the Goof squad.
Reports reveal that this California
reserve team has pushed the varsity
around with case and facility, but
this news may be taken with a very
large grain of the good old com
pound, sodium chloride. The Blue
and Gold freshman team us another
outfit that is popularly supposed to
have steam rollered the varsity.
After perusing these edifying state
ments we get a mental picture of
Ingram and his California varsity as
tottering hulks who are mere shells
of their former selves after the daily
drubbings administered by the goofs.
Work Hard
However, Coach Cuddeback of ihe
Stanford Grays is not underestimat
ing the opposition. On the contrary
he and his assistants, Frankie Willon
and Johnny Bunn, have been driv
ing the Indians through all their
paces this week. Before this time,
the principal task of the Grays has
been, to furnish a Jones system of
offense against the varsity. With the
U.S.C. debacle off the boards, the
Cardinals can now concentrate on
one team.
Coach Murray Cuddeback has an
nounced the following line-up,
which with the exception of White
at fullback, and Goodrich at tackle,
is the same which started in the
Gray's 12 to 6 triumph over the
S.F.U. reserves.
Ends, Grunsky and Packard;
tackles, Ransome and Goodrich;
guards, Gould and Tarver or Rob
erts; center, Blanchard. Lipscomb
and Minekler, halves; Van Dellen,
quarter; and White at full complete
the lineup.
