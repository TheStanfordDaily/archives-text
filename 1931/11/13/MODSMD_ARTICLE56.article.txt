# INGRAM TO START BEST TEAM AGAINST IDAHO ELEVEN AT BERKELEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
■
! Because the Idaho Vandals are not ' 1
ito be considered as a setup and be- <
| cause Bill Ingram wants to see his I i
| best men in action once again be- i
| fore the Big Game, a first string i
Bear lineup will start tomorrow af- j <
I teriloon in the first California-Idaho
| game between the two institutions. 1
The Idaho contest was originally 1
scheduled as a pre - Big Game I
"breather," but after reports from i 1
| the north last Saturday revealed I
that the Vandals had held the strong s
Washington State Cougars to a 9 to 1
8 score with a speedy deceptive at- 5
tack, Ingram decided not to take the 1
game too lightly.
Until last Saturday the Vandals 1
had not made an impressive show- ! '
ing for the season, having won only j -
one conference game. They lost to 1
Oregon 9 to 0 and to Washington 38 *
to 7 in early conference tilts.
Although Ingram will start his '
first eleven, it is quite likely that j ■
j they will not play much if the Bears 1 1
get an early two or three touchdown j '
lead. California, handicapped by 1 k
I minor injuries, will probably be j

without the services of Frank Me
danich at center and C-us Castro at
fullback. However, Bob McArthur,
regular right guard, will return after
missing the call last week because
of an injury.
The Idaho squad contains a light
backfield but a heavy line from
tackle to tackle. An open style of
play is used in which Coach Leo
Calland uses George Wilson, 156-
pound quarterback, in the key po
sition. Wilson holds the distinction
of having made the longest run from
scrimmage in 1930, a 105-yard dash
from fake punt formation.
Following are the lineups an
nounced by both coaches:
California Pos. Idaho
Stone LER Berg
Ransome LTR Sullivan
Carlson LGR Eiden
Baldwin C Spaugy
McArthur RGL Martin
Tozer RTL Bessler
Degnan REL Taylor
Smith Q Wilson
Schaldach LHR Norby
Gill RHL Sackett
Keefer F Tyrrell

! Because the Idaho Vandals are not ' 1
ito be considered as a setup and be- <
| cause Bill Ingram wants to see his I i
| best men in action once again be- i
| fore the Big Game, a first string i
Bear lineup will start tomorrow af- j <
I teriloon in the first California-Idaho
| game between the two institutions. 1
The Idaho contest was originally 1
scheduled as a pre - Big Game I
"breather," but after reports from i 1
| the north last Saturday revealed I
that the Vandals had held the strong s
Washington State Cougars to a 9 to 1
8 score with a speedy deceptive at- 5
tack, Ingram decided not to take the 1
game too lightly.
Until last Saturday the Vandals 1
had not made an impressive show- ! '
ing for the season, having won only j -
one conference game. They lost to 1
Oregon 9 to 0 and to Washington 38 *
to 7 in early conference tilts.
Although Ingram will start his '
first eleven, it is quite likely that j ■
j they will not play much if the Bears 1 1
get an early two or three touchdown j '
lead. California, handicapped by 1 k
I minor injuries, will probably be j

without the services of Frank Me
danich at center and C-us Castro at
fullback. However, Bob McArthur,
regular right guard, will return after
missing the call last week because
of an injury.
The Idaho squad contains a light
backfield but a heavy line from
tackle to tackle. An open style of
play is used in which Coach Leo
Calland uses George Wilson, 156-
pound quarterback, in the key po
sition. Wilson holds the distinction
of having made the longest run from
scrimmage in 1930, a 105-yard dash
from fake punt formation.
Following are the lineups an
nounced by both coaches:
California Pos. Idaho
Stone LER Berg
Ransome LTR Sullivan
Carlson LGR Eiden
Baldwin C Spaugy
McArthur RGL Martin
Tozer RTL Bessler
Degnan REL Taylor
Smith Q Wilson
Schaldach LHR Norby
Gill RHL Sackett
Keefer F Tyrrell
