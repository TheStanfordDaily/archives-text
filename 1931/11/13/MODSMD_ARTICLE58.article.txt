# SOCCERMEN FACE BEARS TOMORROW
## Coach Maloney Absent As Indians Attempt Second Bear Victory 
### 
l
i Having successfully repulsed the
j onslaughts of the pugnacious Bull
j dogs from San Mateo last Tuesday,
! the Stanford varsity soccer team
j yesterday prepared to invade the
i lair of a sullen Berkeley Bear to
i morrow.
The Bear will have had two weeks
j in which te> lick his wounds from
! the first defeat and whip himself
I into a frenzy for the second battle
1 of the annual three-game series.
Maloney Absent
With Coach Maloney in Kansas
j City for a track conference, ihe
| squad is being handled by Coach
j Eberhart ol the freshmen. The In
j dians went through their last hard
i scrimmage before Saturday's con-
I test last night, with Coach Eberhart
j driving them hard to perfect the fast
I passing game of the forward wall.
Physically, the team is in fine
| shape except for the heel injury
j which has been bothering Captain
i Falk all season. Johnny Moore, ster
, ling center-forward, has recovered
j from the foot injury which at first
j threatened to keep him out for the
j ™?st of the schedule, and the Indians
j will go after Bear meat in full force.
Grid Prelim
! Weather permitting the two games
I with California, freshman and var
| sity, will be played in the Berkeley
! Memorial Stadium, the latter as a
I preliminary to Saturday's Califor
! nia-Idaho football game.
If the Cards can get over the Bear
I hurdle they will be favored to take
I home the league gonfalon now held
! by the San Mateo team. Only two
games count in the league standings,
. the third being merely part of the
j annual series between the Bears and
| Cards.
L . | There remains only one more
j : league game after Saturday's clash—
! the postponed game with San Fran
t I cisco University. Although no date
1 has yet beene set the contest will
[• j take place on a field to be selected
) 1 by S.F.U., with Stanford's approval.
Want Revenge
While the Braves are shooting
1 j everything but the water-bucket at
1 j the Bears, the Papooses will be out
i | after a far from playful bunch of
i Cubs. These same little Bears sound
. |ly spanked the yearlings in their
first encounter, and the freshmen
) ! are out for revenge.
j | With the added confidence that
i • they derived from their victory over
i j the Tamalpais team Wednesday, and
;! the experience that they have gained
i j from scrimmages with the varsity,
• , the infant Cards ought to bring
- i home a lot of Bearskins.
i i The varsity game is slated to start
,r|at 11:30 o'clock, or shortly there
t | after, while the yearlings get the
I | whistle at 9:30 o'clock.

i Having successfully repulsed the
j onslaughts of the pugnacious Bull
j dogs from San Mateo last Tuesday,
! the Stanford varsity soccer team
j yesterday prepared to invade the
i lair of a sullen Berkeley Bear to
i morrow.
The Bear will have had two weeks
j in which te> lick his wounds from
! the first defeat and whip himself
I into a frenzy for the second battle
1 of the annual three-game series.
Maloney Absent
With Coach Maloney in Kansas
j City for a track conference, ihe
| squad is being handled by Coach
j Eberhart ol the freshmen. The In
j dians went through their last hard
i scrimmage before Saturday's con-
I test last night, with Coach Eberhart
j driving them hard to perfect the fast
I passing game of the forward wall.
Physically, the team is in fine
| shape except for the heel injury
j which has been bothering Captain
i Falk all season. Johnny Moore, ster
, ling center-forward, has recovered
j from the foot injury which at first
j threatened to keep him out for the
j ™?st of the schedule, and the Indians
j will go after Bear meat in full force.
Grid Prelim
! Weather permitting the two games
I with California, freshman and var
| sity, will be played in the Berkeley
! Memorial Stadium, the latter as a
I preliminary to Saturday's Califor
! nia-Idaho football game.
If the Cards can get over the Bear
I hurdle they will be favored to take
I home the league gonfalon now held
! by the San Mateo team. Only two
games count in the league standings,
. the third being merely part of the
j annual series between the Bears and
| Cards.
L . | There remains only one more
j : league game after Saturday's clash—
! the postponed game with San Fran
t I cisco University. Although no date
1 has yet beene set the contest will
[• j take place on a field to be selected
) 1 by S.F.U., with Stanford's approval.
Want Revenge
While the Braves are shooting
1 j everything but the water-bucket at
1 j the Bears, the Papooses will be out
i | after a far from playful bunch of
i Cubs. These same little Bears sound
. |ly spanked the yearlings in their
first encounter, and the freshmen
) ! are out for revenge.
j | With the added confidence that
i • they derived from their victory over
i j the Tamalpais team Wednesday, and
;! the experience that they have gained
i j from scrimmages with the varsity,
• , the infant Cards ought to bring
- i home a lot of Bearskins.
i i The varsity game is slated to start
,r|at 11:30 o'clock, or shortly there
t | after, while the yearlings get the
I | whistle at 9:30 o'clock.
