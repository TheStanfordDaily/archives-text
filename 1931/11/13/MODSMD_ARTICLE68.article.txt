# GUIDE FOR SOLVING STUDENT PROBLEMS TO BE DISTRIBUTED
## 
### 
Believing that many Stanford stu
dents, especially freshmen and jun
ior transfers, do not know whom to
ask for help in solving their prob
lems, the vocational guidance office
has prepared a bulletin for distri
bution to students, '"Sources of Help
on Student Problems."
Under the headings "1. Scholar
ship and Curriculum Problems; 2.
Problems of Social Adjustment: and
3. Financial Problems," are listed
the names of members of the fac
ulty or other responsible persons
who can give help to students.
Copies of this valuable bulletin
may be obtained free in the office
of the vocational guidance secretary,
Gilbert Wrenn, in the Administra
tion Building.
