# 11 CASTAWAYS SAVED AT SEA
## Five Drowned As Schooner Sinks In Storm 
### 
BALBOA. C.Z., Nov. 12 (/P). —
Bearing a tale of disaster and hero
ism, the master and ten men of the
Costa Rican schooner Baden Baden
were snatched from the waters of
the Caribbean today and were
bound back toward Cristobal tonight
aboard the U. S. S. minesweeper
Swan.
The captain of the Swan wire
lessed here that the seamen had
been rescued from an open lifeboat
off the coast of Colombia and would
be landed at 9 o'clock tomorrow
morning. Five of the complement
had been lost, he reported, and Cap
tain Hewitt Watler of Mobile, Ala.,
was suffering from contusions to his
back and possible internal injuries.
Founders in Storm
The vessel foundered Monday af
ternoon in heavy seas and the crew
took to lifeboats and liferafts, with
the exception of the two owners,
Hans J. Lau of Punta Arenas, Costa
Rica, and Adolph Schonek of Ham
burg, Germany, who refused to
leave the sinking ship and went to
a watery grave. How the others met
their deaths was not revealed.
During a storm which raged along
the isthmus and the north coast of
Colombia, on Monday, the cargo
shifted and the pumps went out of
order, causing the vessel to sink
within 20 minutes.
Drifted Three Days
Without food and with only rain
for water, the crew drifted for three
days until they were picked up by
the Swan. They were sighted 20
minutes after the vessel went down
by a Pan-American pilot, but he
could not take them aboard because
of the roughness of the sea.
When the Swan came alongside
Captain Watler was carried aboard
on a stretcher and all gave thanks
for their delivery. They were
bathed and given soup, cigarets and
clothes by the crew.
