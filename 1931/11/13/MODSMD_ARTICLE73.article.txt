### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 (/P).â€”No
political truce and no yielding to
political expediency were the guide
posts set for the Democrats in the
next House today by Representative
Garner.
The Democratic choice for the
speakership said President Hoover's
proposals to the coming Congress
would be considered on their mer
its. They will be neither automati
cally condemned nor automatically
sanctified because they come from
the White House, he said.
"For my part, if wc organize the
House, politics will be a secondary
consideration and I think every
member of my party feels the same
way," he added.
