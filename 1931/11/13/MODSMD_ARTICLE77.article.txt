NEW YORK, Nov. 12 (/P).â€”After
a summer of depression, news con
cerning the Olympiad to be con
tested at Lake Placid and Los An
geles next year has turned bullish
with indications now that the tenth
revival of the Greek games will be
bigger and better than ever.
Last summer several countries,
among them France and Sweden,
were uncertain whether they would
be able to finance a team on the
long trek to the snowy Adirondacks
and then to sunny California. Today
Daniel J. Ferris, Secretary-Treasur
er of the Amateur Athletic Union,
beamingly predicted a record num
ber of entries for the Olympics.
