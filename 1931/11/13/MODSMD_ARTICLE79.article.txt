and German debtors are getting to
gether every day.
They are discussing what shall be

Berlin representative of a large New
York bank, "no matter how much
the French may insist that repara

Bank cannot but take cognizance of
arrangements made with regard to
private debts."
These debts, he said, are being
adjusted in daily conferences right
