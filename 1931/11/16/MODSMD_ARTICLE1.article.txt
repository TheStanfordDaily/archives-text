# Cards Point For Big Game After Downing Nevada
## Injury Situation Favors California In Final Summing-Up POP PREDICTS 'TOSS-UP' All Card Ends And Centers To See Action 
### Lowell Cox 
Just five more days.
That's all the time left to Pop
Warner and Bill Ingram to round
their charges into shape for the
Large Fracas next Saturday. Cali
fornia enters the last lap a 10 to 8
favorite after a quiet week-end in
which both the Indians and the
Bears won "breather" games with
out great difficulty.
Warner journeyed to Berkeley
Saturday to see the California-
Idaho contest, but as the Vandals
failed to extend the Bears, the Old
Man saw very little indeed. The
Berkeley eleven used only a half
dozen plays in the entire game,
keeping well under cover.
Big Game "Toss-Up"
The Old Man still regards the ap
proaching classic as a "toss-up,
while Ingram worries because his
team has been installed the favorite.
After a week of light, public
workouts, the secret practice sign
will again go up at the Indian prac
tice field today. Warner indicated
yesterday that the week will be
taken up with a general smoothing
up of offense, work on the dummy
machines, and perfection of the
fundamentals, tackling and block
ing.
Squad Leaves Campus
Following Wednesday night's ral
ly, Pop will take the squad into
seclusion at Castlewood Country
Club until game time Saturday.
A survey of the injury situation
reveals an edge to California, with
George Watkins, Louis Di Resta, Ed
Kirwan, Bob McArthur, and other
important cogs in Ingram's machine
expected to be ready to start.
On the other hand, Phil Moffatt,
Stanford's star at the same post, is
not likely to be of great use to the
Indians Saturday. Dr. Fritz Roth
indicated last night that he may be
able to play for a short time, de
pending entirely on how his in
jured knee responds to treatment
during the week.
Warner is not relying on much
help from Moffatt, and is looking
to Spud Hardy and Kennie Affler
baugh to fill the post. The Old Man
indicated yesterday that Hardy is
the most likely to start, but that
Afflcrbaugh will be injected into
the contest if Caddel's punting falls
down.
Ililfman To Play
Captain Harry Hillman is out of
the hospital and will be ready Sat
urday, but may be bothered by the
hip injury he received in the Tro
jan contest. Other Stanford players,
with the exception of Tod, are ex
pected to be in shape.
Starters for the center and end
positions arc somewhat in doubt.
Marks will probably get the call at ■
the pivot position, instead of Milli- |
gan, as against U.S.C., according to j
Warner.
Colvin and Doub Ends
Pop regards Colvin and Neill at j
left end and Doub and Norgard at !
right end as stand-offs. Colvia and
Doub appear the most likely to
open.
"It doesn't make any difference
which pair starts," Warner said yes
terday, "they will all see plenty of
action.
The following guess at the starling
lineups is as good as another:
California — Stanford—
Stone LER Doub
Ransome LTR Ehrhorn
Carlson LGR Cor bus
Medanich C Marks
McArthur RGL Bigelow
Tozer RTL Hand
Di Resta REL Colvin
Kirwan Q Hillman
Watkins LHR Caddel
Gill RHL Hardy
Castro F Allen

A survey of the injury situation
reveals an edge to California, with
George Watkins, Louis Di Resta, Ed
Kirwan, Bob McArthur, and other
important cogs in Ingram's machine
expected to be ready to start.
On the other hand, Phil Moffatt,
Stanford's star at the same post, is
not likely to be of great use to the
Indians Saturday. Dr. Fritz Roth
indicated last night that he may be
able to play for a short time, de
pending entirely on how his in
jured knee responds to treatment
during the week.
Warner is not relying on much
help from Moffatt, and is looking
to Spud Hardy and Kennie Affler
baugh to fill the post. The Old Man
indicated yesterday that Hardy is
the most likely to start, but that
Afflcrbaugh will be injected into
the contest if Caddel's punting falls
down.
Ililfman To Play
Captain Harry Hillman is out of
the hospital and will be ready Sat
urday, but may be bothered by the
hip injury he received in the Tro
jan contest. Other Stanford players,
with the exception of Tod, are ex
pected to be in shape.
Starters for the center and end
positions arc somewhat in doubt.
Marks will probably get the call at ■
the pivot position, instead of Milli- |
gan, as against U.S.C., according to j
Warner.
Colvin and Doub Ends
Pop regards Colvin and Neill at j
left end and Doub and Norgard at !
right end as stand-offs. Colvia and
Doub appear the most likely to
open.
"It doesn't make any difference
which pair starts," Warner said yes
terday, "they will all see plenty of
action.
The following guess at the starling
lineups is as good as another:
California — Stanford—
Stone LER Doub
Ransome LTR Ehrhorn
Carlson LGR Cor bus
Medanich C Marks
McArthur RGL Bigelow
Tozer RTL Hand
Di Resta REL Colvin
Kirwan Q Hillman
Watkins LHR Caddel
Gill RHL Hardy
Castro F Allen
Just five more days.
That's all the time left to Pop
Warner and Bill Ingram to round
their charges into shape for the
Large Fracas next Saturday. Cali
fornia enters the last lap a 10 to 8
favorite after a quiet week-end in
which both the Indians and the
Bears won "breather" games with
out great difficulty.
Warner journeyed to Berkeley
Saturday to see the California-
Idaho contest, but as the Vandals
failed to extend the Bears, the Old
Man saw very little indeed. The
Berkeley eleven used only a half
dozen plays in the entire game,
keeping well under cover.
Big Game "Toss-Up"
The Old Man still regards the ap
proaching classic as a "toss-up,
while Ingram worries because his
team has been installed the favorite.
After a week of light, public
workouts, the secret practice sign
will again go up at the Indian prac
tice field today. Warner indicated
yesterday that the week will be
taken up with a general smoothing
up of offense, work on the dummy
machines, and perfection of the
fundamentals, tackling and block
ing.
Squad Leaves Campus
Following Wednesday night's ral
ly, Pop will take the squad into
seclusion at Castlewood Country
Club until game time Saturday.
