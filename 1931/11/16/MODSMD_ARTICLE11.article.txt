# Beetles Conquer Trees After 15- Year Struggle
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
A battle to the finish has been
taking place on the Stanford cam
pus these last fifteen years—a tragic
war that has gone for the most part
unnoticed but that has none ihe
less brought desolation and un
happiness in its wake.
Several million beetles have for
many long month < been attacking a
stalwart army of Monterey pine and
I spruce trees, and their insidious ac
tivity has at lasl been rewarded. The
| sobbing sighs of the spruces and ihc
i pining peels of the pines announce
: to the world that they are con-
I quered—no longer may we stroll
j and spoon 'neath the sympathetic
branches of thr arboretum.
The contestants have agreed, now
that the battle is over, to call in a
, neutral party to arrange the terms
of peace. Stanford authorities were

j chosen, and at the recommendation
| of Dr. Burke, a senior entymologist
j of the United States Department of
1 Agriculture, it has been decided to
| cut down (he treces that were af
! fected by the war.
j The beetles were forced to call in
jour old relative, Mother Nature, to
laid them in their attack, and she
j kindly assisted the victors by or
| dering a fifteen-year drought. Un
der ordinary conditions, there is lit
tle doubt that the trees would have
successfully repulsed the invaders.
The effect of the war is doubly
i tragic, as the trees were in their
| very prime at the time of their de
! feat. Planted fifty years ago by the
| late Senator Stanford, the pines and
I spruces had just reached their ma
turity at the time of the beetle in
| vasion.
