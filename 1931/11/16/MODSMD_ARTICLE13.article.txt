jln a spectacular upset today, the
| University of San Francisco's foot
i ball warriors defeated Santa Clara
j 7 to 0 before a crowd of approxi
i matcly 12,000 spectators at Kezar
J Stadium.
Led by big Bob Kleckner, left
halfback, the San Franciscans played
brilliantly both on offense and de
fense to take the measure of a
! Santa Clara eleven that went into
jthe game a strong favorite.
After a fairly even first period.
| the San Franciscans shoved across
! their lone score in the second quar
ter. San Francisco had been given
the ball on Santa Clara's 19-yard
line as the result of a penalty for
holding on the part of the latter
team. With Kleckner denting the
I line for good gains the San Fran
| ciscans reached the one-yard line,
j Fitzgerald, sent into replace Kleck-
I ner, crashed over for the score, and
I Carrigan, substitute for Fitzgerald,
'j added the extra point with a place
I kick.
