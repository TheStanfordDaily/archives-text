# BIG 'C' PAINTED RED; STANFORD FEARS BONFIRE ATTACK
## Guards Will Be Well Organized For Onslaught Berkeleyans Stand Watch Over "C" After Repainting Reddened Letter; Assault on Pyre Expected, With Present Guard Inadequate WERDER CALLS FRESHMAN MEETING TONIGHT Chances Slight of Rebuilding Structure if Lighted; Much Construction Work Yet Remains 
### 
jUEWS thai California's Big "C" had been painted red <»n Saturday night
and reports that the Berkeleyaus were planning a concerted attack on
the Big Game bonfire have prompted Bill Werder, chairman of the bonfire
| committee, to call a meeting of all freshmen at Encina Hall at 7 o'clock
! tonight, where plans for guarding the pyre will be formulated.
; From the Daily Californian came the news that the giant "C" 011 the
J hill back of the campus was smeared a gorgeous red on Saturday night.
Loyal sons of the Blue and Gold repainted it yellow yesterday and will
watch over it until game time. Whether 'or not the painting of the "C"is
an act of Stanford men, California will probably attempt to retaliate by
igniting (he bonfire prematurely, Werder declared, adding that he had
well-authenticated reports that such an attack will certainly be made.
It was pointed out that both institutions have a standing agreement pro-

the invasions of their re
| spcctive campuses and imposing
heavy penalties on the perpetrators
• of such an act.
Guard Inadequate
Branding the present guard as in
| adequate to repel an attack such as
J the Berkeleyans are said to be plan-
I ning, he has called upon the fresh
, men to work together to protect the
j product of their own labor. Although
| details of the expected attack were
j not divulged, all members of the
| bonfire committee were emphatic in
j declaring that it was not one of the
j usual "before the blaze" rumors, but
I an actual known danger.
1 If the bonfire is prematurely de
j stroyed, Werder said, there will be
no possibility of rebuilding it, as
was done in 1928. Shortage of fuel
and reluctance of University offi
cials to grant permission to under
take the venture again would block
all chances for the reconstruction.
A system of guarding the roads
to the scene of the bonfire will be
outlined at tonight's meeting by Bob
Atkinson of the committee. It will
call for at least three times as many
men as are now doing guard duty,
he declared.
Much Work Remains
Stressing the additional need of a
larger corps of workers, Encina Club
President Marvie Kahn revealed
1. that the greater part of the work
j done yesterday was accomplished
by only about 20 men. Even though
the structure has already reached
huge proportions, Kahn pointed out
i the fact that practically unlimited
| work remains to be done.
1 Both Werder and Kahn were
| anxious to point out that the Cam
; panile proper, towering 30 feet above
| the 40-foot skeleton already nearing
1 completion, is yet to be erected.
! After the framework is completed
i there still remains the task of filling
! the huge vat with the fuel which
:'will feed the flames Wednesday
I night. Great piles of wood, railroad
1 ties, and other inflammable debris
; have been collected and held ready
| for this purpose.
j The mock burning of the Cam
-1 panile will take place after the Big
i Game rally Wednesday night. Many
! spectators from San Francisco and
! neighboring cities arc expected to
' witness the celebration.
Coon-Sanders Orchestra is now
j playing at the Hotel New Yorker.
