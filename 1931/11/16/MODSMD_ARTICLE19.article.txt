Willi a smug complacence that presages more such
legislation, Women's (Council has ruled that no Stanford
woman shall go to the Honflre at night to serve food to the
youths who are working to erect the Big (lame pyre.
For the past four years, at least, Stanford women have
helped with the Bonfire. This year, they are more eager
than ever to help, but Women's Council, that oracle of self
satisfied, narrow-visioned wisdom, has decreed against it.
In a letter written to every sorority president, the Council
forbids any women going near the bonfire, forbids their
taking late leaves to do so, and promises to "lake whatever
action is needed" against those women that dare to fjwut
the Council's wishes.
Of course, Council recognizes the fact that women have
served at the past Bonfires, but Council "feels that the tra
dition should be broken." All of which gives rise to the
question of just what the hell Council thinks it is. The five
sapient females who compose that august body have not
advanced a valid objection that the Bonfire committee has
not agreed to meet, but still the Righteous Quintet re
mained firm in its bull-headed decision. If Council can
regulate the activities of Stanford women at the Bonfire,
AGAINST THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY, where will the
thing end? If Council's inflated sense of its own impor
tance can urge il to hold a blackjack over the heads of the
Five Hundred in this case, .what's to prevent that black
jack making its appearance at any time Council pleases?
Certainly not the sound judgment that Women's Council
is supposed to possess and failed so miserably to exhibit
in jamming over this last piece of legislation.
