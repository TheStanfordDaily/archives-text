# Three Touchdowns Result Of Passes As Cards Score 26-0 Win
## LACOMBE PROVES STAR Substitutes Thrill Crowd With Long Gains 
### Dick Rodda 
j Piling up yardage almost at will,
{ the Indian reserves gave an excel
' lent account of themselves Saturday
• in crushing a snarling Nevada Wolf
Pack, 26 to 0.
i Only lack of a scoring punch with
!in the 10-yard line prevented the
j score from being twice as» large. The
j determined defentc of the invaders
I yielded but one touchdown on run
| ning plays, the Indians being forced
j to take to the air to collect the other
three.
Sub Fullbacks Good
Jack Hillman and John Hancock,
substitute fullbacks, surprised the
shivering crowd of less than 3.000
with forward passing feats which
would have done credit to Dusty
Allen himself, while Phil Neil, Mike
Reynolds, and Frenchy Lacombe
did a few "Colvins" ton the receiv
ing end of their tosses.
Stanford opened the game with a
long march down the field which
ended in the Nevada 10-yard line.
Another attack, featured by a 34-
yard gain on a forward-lateral pass,
was stopped on the Nevada one
yard line a few minutes later.
The Cards came back in the be
i ginning of the second quarter, how
| ever, to climax one of these drives
with a pass, from Jack Hillman to
■ Neil over the goal line. Neil was
! covered by two Nevada men, but
! leaped high into the air to snag the
i ball.
Stanford Scores
Stanford scored again in the last
j minute of the half on another pass,
J from Hillman to Reynolds, that net-
I ted 30 yards and a touchdown.
' Nevada held the Indians again in
; the third quarter, but yielded two
| more scores in the final period. The
I first, early in the period, came as
the result of a steady 40-yard march.
Hillman and Lambert did most of
the ball-carrying, with Hancock
| going over for the score from the
one-yard line. Lacombe converted.
Stanford's final touchdown came
in the last minute of play after La
combe intercepted a Nevada pass on
the Pack's 40-yard line. On the next
play Lacombe took a long pass from
j Hancock.
