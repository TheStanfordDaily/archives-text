President Kerr of Oregon Slate College and the Metho
dist hoard of trustees of I.S.C. will not allow cigarette
advertising in the Oregon Slate Barometer or the U.S.C.
Daily Trojan, campus publications of the two schools.
This restraint on advertising is one of the most impor
tant, if not the prime factor that prevents these two papers
from being self-suporting.
it is hard to believe that in these enlightened times such
a rule preventing cigarette advertising, which a couple of
decades ago might have appeared necessary for the pro
tection of public morals, is still in force. Such a restriction
of these papers can do no possible good when the various
brands of smokes are llaunted from every billboard, de
scribed over the radio and advertised in nearly every
newspaper in the country.
This regulation neither prevents anyone from hearing
about nor smoking cigarettes nor raises these papers in
the opinion of anyone except a few old-fashioned puritans
who think they are still living in the days of the tandem
bike and live-cent beer.
And when such a ruling actually hampers the papers
concerned, it is a step too far in a feeble attempt to uphold
a lost puritanism.
