# A 						NEW RACE?

Pity the poor movie stars.,
From that northern center of learning and culture, the
University of Washington, comes the dire news that mov
ing pictures have received the official frown from the aus
tere pedagogues who hold forth in Washington's halls of
wisdom.
Ten years ago these same professors were questioned as
to who were their particular movie idols. At that time a
couple of the more timid ones dared to mention weakly
that they rather liked Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford,
while the rest shuddered at the mere mention of such a
Hohemian amusement.
Ten years has wrought a change and a similar survey
recently made showed that the rebels, who a decade ago
had dared to admit the attraction of the movies, had been
w hipped into line and the questioners met a, solid front of
professorial dignity.
Is it true that moving pictures are such a debased and
frivolous form of entertainment that people with an IQ
of over 70 should find no pleasure in them or are professors
a peculiar race of men who are sadly out of place upon
this planet ?
