There are two major ideas of what
a university should be. One is that
we should have libraries on every
corner of the quatt; have the stu
dents dress in black; erect shrines
to Phi Beta Kappa where three
times a day the student body can go
to worship; abolish athletics and
turn all gyms into auxiliary study
halls. The other picture of what a
college is to be, is modeled after
adolescent ideals, College Humor,
and Tom Jones-at-College books.
Here varsity-dragging, queening,
and football are the characteristic
activities; here spider webs grow
over the library entrance; and
studying becomes, like prohibition,
an experiment noble in purpose but
indulged in, even far less.
Of course, few if any, institutions
of higher learning reach either of
these two extremes. Many lean one
way or the other, however. It is al
ways necessary that a university
take note which path it is traveling.
U.S.C. with the biggest band on the
coast, probably the best football
team (St. Mary's notwithstanding),
and a type of vociferous school spirit
that none can equal, is pointing
one way. Stanford, although it
wished to beat U.S.C., and nothing
preceding or succeeding is to be
construed as rationalization of our
defeat, has always been attempting
to be something more than a place
to spend four years following high
school.
The Farm has had its ballyhoo—
its axe business—its teams —and its
yells, but behind all this there has
stood something else—something that
was genuinely real. The fact that
Stanford has a .scholastic standing
