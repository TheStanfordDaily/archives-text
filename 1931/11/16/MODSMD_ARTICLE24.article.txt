PARABLE OF THE MAN WHO
BECAME A SUCCESS
1. And it came to pass that there
was born in the country of the
United Slates a child who was
named Samuel. And great was to be
his fortune, for he was begot by
two good American citizens.
2. And Samuel spent his youth in
the public schools; and he learned
to do all things a3 he was told; and
none was so good as he in wor
shipping his flag and his god.
3. And when he was in his nine
teenth year he went and abode in
a great college wherof he had heard
much in the sporting columns; and
he ran much with the ball, and the
onlookers cried: behold. The same
time he spake much, but learned
little.
4. And after four years of this
Samuel went unto a business man,
asking what he might do that he
could eat and see Marlene Dietrich.
5. Then said the business man:
Hast thou a good tie, a loud mouth,
and a good palm so as to hail peo
ple? Go then, and for these bonds
bring me shekels.
6. And Samuel went; and it came
to pass that he sold many bonds and

I gathered many shekels, whereat the |
: people thought much of him, and
, feasted him.
7. Then did Samuel's better self
j master him, and he said: but I am
Ino more than I was. But they
j mocked him, saying, but thou hast |
! done. And they placed more liquors 1
j before him.
8. And it came to pass that his ;
; employer called him and said: thou :
j hast done much with thy good tie,
! thy voice, and thy welcoming hand.
| We desire thee as advertising man-
I ager. And Samuel accepted.
3. And Samuel spread throughout
the land much green paint, which
j said, Hooey's Soapâ€”lt Slips; and
the people bought Hooey's Soap.
! 10. And Samuel said: but the soap
' is not better than before: but his
1 employer replied, saying: thou hast
; used bigger and better green paint,
j Thou art truly successful.
11. Then was Samuel feasted
j heavily; and the people read of him j
i in the daily writs; and they said:
| behold, a great man is among us. |
| 12. And in time there was born to j
j Samuel's wife a son, and Samuel
j thought much of him, and said: it i
I must be made sure that thou too j
| wilt become a success.
i 13. And so saying, he placed in'
| the child's crib a megaphone and a
I bucket of green paint.
