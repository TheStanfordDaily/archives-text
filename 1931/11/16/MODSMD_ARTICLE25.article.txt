TIIE YELLOW TICKET—AI the
New Stanford Theatre.
"The Yellow Ticket" brings Rus
sian Dukes and fearsome Cossacks
back to the silver blah-screen. The
material is time-worn but the man
ner of presentation is excellent.
German competition seems to have
put the spirit into the jaded minds
of Hollywood directors with the re
sult that they have produced several
pictures recently wiih really excel
lent photographic effects and this is
one of the best.
Lionel Barrymore could not have
been better cast than as the disso
lute and hard-hearted duke, head
of the Russian police. Elissa Landi
as the little Russian-Jewish girl who
does wonders to revenge the killing
of her father, justifies her publicity
ballyhoo, and presents an altogether
pretty picture, and Laurence Olivier
as her English journalist lover is
fine.
Unconvincing situations and plot
do nothing to spoil what is really a
very good picture if you are in the
mood for melodrama.
An excellent Mickey Mouse car
toon and a not too bad comedy com
plete the bill. —S.C.A.
