# CARD POLO QUARTET DEFEATED 13-11 BY MENLO CIRCUS CLUB
## 
### 
After holding the strong Menlo
I Circus Club to three goals in the
! first five chukkers, the Stanford polo
1 team bowed acknowledgment to its
) more experienced opponents and
i was defeated 13-11 Friday on the
Encina field.
Since the Menlo outfit carries a
l 14-goal handicap and Stanford has
! no handicap at all, the Redshirls
j were spotted 10 goals to partially
; equalize the different between the
I two teams. Considering that this
| was their first game of the season,
j and that their horses were distinctly
j inferior to Menlo's, the Stanford
; four made an excellent showing.
The Elisaldc brothers, Miguel and
| Angel, starred for Menlo. They
, scored 0 of the 13 goals for their
team. Captain. Tevis demonstrated
1 that lie was well worthy of his six
! goal rating.
It would be unfair to say which
i of the Cardinal players were out
! standing. All of them played bril
i liant polo.
