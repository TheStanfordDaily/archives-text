# Fighting Indian Soccermen Take California Series
## CARDS NOSE OUT BERKELEYITES 3-2 IN SECOND GAME Inspired Yearling Eleven Holds Powerful Cubs To 1-1 Standoff 
### 
Slashing, tearing, fighting to the
final whittle, a mud-coated band of
Stanford Indians shot the California
Bears' series hopes full of holes
Saturday when they won the second
straight soccer game of the year
from the Berkeley men, 3-2.
As usual, the Bears scored first,
and as usual, Stanford came from
behind to run up three goals in
quick succession. But this time it
was an enraged, twice-beaten quad
ruped thai clawed at a pack of
Cards perched precariously near the
top of the championship tree.
Bears Score
California's first score was a
doubtful one. A hard drive at Goalie
Webster was stopped on or in front
of the line by Stanford's stellar de
fense man, but before he could
throw the ball out of danger ihe
whistle blew, and California was
credited with their initial score.
Shortly after the second half com
menced the Indian was within easy
shot of the Bear's lair, and Captain
Talk took advantage of a mixup in
front of the goal to bang the ball
between the upi'ights to tie the
score.
Cards Make II Three
With a lead of two to one the
Indian should have been satisfied,
but five minutes later he had worked
the water-soaked ball down near
the California goal again, and Moore
followed up one of Preston Plumb's
throw-ins and drove it into the net
for the Card's last score.
Three minutes left to play, and
the Cards were throwing in sub
stitutes. California drove the ball at
Webster from every conceivable
spot on the field. Time and again
Holmes and Brekelbaum "saved'
the score, from inches in front of
the Indian net. But they couldn't
score, and the Indian went home
with enough bearskins to pawn for
gold soccer balls.
Freshmen Tic
Setting an example which the
varsity improved on later, the Stan
ford freshman kickers held a highly
favored California yearling team to
a 1-1 tie.
The Cubs tallied first when the
wet ball slipped between Goalie
Brownton's hands, but the freshmen
evened the count when Rojas took a
nice pass from Trctten and drove
it into the net.
The outstanding freshmen through
out the season were White, Captain
Doug Kennedy, Tretten, Emerick,
and in the last game Rojas and
Weaver.

front of the goal to bang the ball
between the upi'ights to tie the
score.
Cards Make II Three
With a lead of two to one the
Indian should have been satisfied,
but five minutes later he had worked
the water-soaked ball down near
the California goal again, and Moore
followed up one of Preston Plumb's
throw-ins and drove it into the net
for the Card's last score.
Three minutes left to play, and
the Cards were throwing in sub
stitutes. California drove the ball at
Webster from every conceivable
spot on the field. Time and again
Holmes and Brekelbaum "saved'
the score, from inches in front of
the Indian net. But they couldn't
score, and the Indian went home
with enough bearskins to pawn for
gold soccer balls.
Freshmen Tic
Setting an example which the
varsity improved on later, the Stan
ford freshman kickers held a highly
favored California yearling team to
a 1-1 tie.
The Cubs tallied first when the
wet ball slipped between Goalie
Brownton's hands, but the freshmen
evened the count when Rojas took a
nice pass from Trctten and drove
it into the net.
The outstanding freshmen through
out the season were White, Captain
Doug Kennedy, Tretten, Emerick,
and in the last game Rojas and
Weaver.
Slashing, tearing, fighting to the
final whittle, a mud-coated band of
Stanford Indians shot the California
Bears' series hopes full of holes
Saturday when they won the second
straight soccer game of the year
from the Berkeley men, 3-2.
As usual, the Bears scored first,
and as usual, Stanford came from
behind to run up three goals in
quick succession. But this time it
was an enraged, twice-beaten quad
ruped thai clawed at a pack of
Cards perched precariously near the
top of the championship tree.
Bears Score
California's first score was a
doubtful one. A hard drive at Goalie
Webster was stopped on or in front
of the line by Stanford's stellar de
fense man, but before he could
throw the ball out of danger ihe
whistle blew, and California was
credited with their initial score.
Shortly after the second half com
menced the Indian was within easy
shot of the Bear's lair, and Captain
Talk took advantage of a mixup in
front of the goal to bang the ball
between the upi'ights to tie the
score.
