# RAIN HALTS BABES' FIRST NET CONTEST
## 
### 
Rain drowned out the first fresh
man racquet effort of the season
Saturday, the scheduled matches
with Santa Clara being called off,
with no definite future date set for
the encounter. It is probable that it
will not occur until winter quarter,
along with the scheduled season
matches.
Novice tournament activity was
likewise curtailed for the week-end,
with the result that only one con
test was played, in the junior divi
sion. Robert Piercy broke into the
semifinals with a win over Jim
Gratiot, 6-2, 6-3, to become the first
semifinalist of the division. Besides
the Day vs. Woelz encounter, Wallace
vs. Reed is the only quarterfinal
bracket x-emaining unfilled.
