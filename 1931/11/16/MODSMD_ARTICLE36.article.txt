# FOUL WEATHER AND EASTMAN BROTHERS PROVIDE INTEREST IN WEEK'S TRACKFEST
## 
### 
A cold, windy day, many disabled
! or disinclined track stars, and the
i Eastman brothers, combined to pro
vide the features of last Friday's
! practice track meet. The weather
I and the absent prima donnas made
j the performances as a group poor,
j while Ben and Sam contributed the
i majority of the day's thrills.
Sam Eastman was Friday's only
j double winner, 'and he showed to
advantage in finishing first, in both
; the 660 and the two-lap runs. His
j times of 3:21.8 and 1:29, considering
; the conditions and Sam's long lay
off, were excellent. Big brother Ben
' required only 22 seconds to nego
; tiate 220 yards against a stiff breeze,
, and he also finished second in the
100. The latter race was won by
, Ralph Giberson, who broad-jumped
a good three fet just before the
I gun sounded and thus built up a
j lead that Eastman was unable to
j overcome.
The expected battle in the high
j hurdles was won by Brugman, with
i Stallings and Meier just behind.
; Brugman's stiffest opposition came
from the wind; nevertheless hp was
j able to make his usual time of :15.8
j seconds. Horizontal Herbert con
tinued to be undefeated in the lows,
as did John Lyman in the shot-put
and Bob Jones in the discus.
The almost impossible was accom
plished by Bill Miller of Menlo J.C.
| when he pole-vaulted 13 feet 6
I inches in an early season meet.
( Stanford's own Ned Johns and Bert
DeGroot shared second place be-
I twecn them at 12 feet 6 inches. The

t high-jump resulted in a triple tie
between Clyne, Keeble, and the
i versatile Jones.
Dan Murphy passed A1 Blackman
j on the turn and then held his lead
to win the first heat of the 352 in
I :40.2. Blackman had previously won
one heat of the 100 in the good time
of 10.2, so that his day's work was
successful. Charlie deßretteville
finally got up in the money when
<he beat George Naylon out of a
| second place in the 660. The broad
j jump, as usual, went to Virg Dowell,
j with Williams, Willard, and Reppy
I all jumping over 20 feet 4 inches to
| finish in that order.

and Bob Jones in the discus.
The almost impossible was accom
plished by Bill Miller of Menlo J.C.
| when he pole-vaulted 13 feet 6
I inches in an early season meet.
( Stanford's own Ned Johns and Bert
DeGroot shared second place be-
I twecn them at 12 feet 6 inches. The

t high-jump resulted in a triple tie
between Clyne, Keeble, and the
i versatile Jones.
Dan Murphy passed A1 Blackman
j on the turn and then held his lead
to win the first heat of the 352 in
I :40.2. Blackman had previously won
one heat of the 100 in the good time
of 10.2, so that his day's work was
successful. Charlie deßretteville
finally got up in the money when
<he beat George Naylon out of a
| second place in the 660. The broad
j jump, as usual, went to Virg Dowell,
j with Williams, Willard, and Reppy
I all jumping over 20 feet 4 inches to
| finish in that order.
A cold, windy day, many disabled
! or disinclined track stars, and the
i Eastman brothers, combined to pro
vide the features of last Friday's
! practice track meet. The weather
I and the absent prima donnas made
j the performances as a group poor,
j while Ben and Sam contributed the
i majority of the day's thrills.
Sam Eastman was Friday's only
j double winner, 'and he showed to
advantage in finishing first, in both
; the 660 and the two-lap runs. His
j times of 3:21.8 and 1:29, considering
; the conditions and Sam's long lay
off, were excellent. Big brother Ben
' required only 22 seconds to nego
; tiate 220 yards against a stiff breeze,
, and he also finished second in the
100. The latter race was won by
, Ralph Giberson, who broad-jumped
a good three fet just before the
I gun sounded and thus built up a
j lead that Eastman was unable to
j overcome.
The expected battle in the high
j hurdles was won by Brugman, with
i Stallings and Meier just behind.
; Brugman's stiffest opposition came
from the wind; nevertheless hp was
j able to make his usual time of :15.8
j seconds. Horizontal Herbert con
tinued to be undefeated in the lows,
as did John Lyman in the shot-put
and Bob Jones in the discus.
