# CALIFORNIA UNDER WRAPS IN TRIUMPH OVER IDAHO TEAM
## Smith Of The Vandals Best Player On The Field In Muddy Clash 
### Spud Hamilton 
Slipping along in their accustomed
mud habitat, the California football
team defeated Idaho 18 to 0 Satur
day. In their last contest before the
Big Game, Coach Ingram's proteges
showed practically nothing for the
information of "Pop" Warner as the
latter sat in the Memorial Stadium
press box. The California quarter
backs limited their selection of plays
to a half-dozen, more or less.
Three complete Blue and Gold
teams were used, and the individual
honors were so thinly spread that
no man was outstanding for the
winners. Rusty Gill played his usual
smashing game on defense, bsides
cracking the line for better than a
three-yard average. The doughty
Dutchman, Schaldach, had a moment
of brilliance when he scored from
the fifteen-yard line behind beau
tiful interference.
Of the reserve backs, Cattolica
and Keefer were most impressive to
the writer. The California line func
tioned effectively, and opened large
holes for the runners.
The outstanding personality on
the field was Idaho's quarter, Smith.
Although handicapped in no small
degree by the field, he was a con
stant threat. Most of the Idaho plays
were designed to get him away, and
when they worked, Smith gave the
fans a treat. Calling that field turf
is a very bald form of irony, and
yet the Idaho flash made runs of
44, 27, and 14 yards, besides return
ing punts 17 and 38 yards. Those
California left tackles, ends, and de
fensive halves looked none too good
at the time.
