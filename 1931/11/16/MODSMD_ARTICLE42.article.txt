# BABE TRACK STAR SETS NEW RECORD IN CROSS-COUNTRY
## Morentin Breaks Tape; El Toro Wins Championship For Fifth Time 
### 
1 Although confronted by a muddy
course and a cloudy day, Phil Mor-
I entin, freshman distance star, man
| aged to set a new record while win
: ning the annual intramural cross
j country run last Saturday. Moren
; tin's time for the rough 4.8 miles
trip was 26 minutes 23.6 seconds,
and replaces the mark of 2(5 minutes
: 50 seconds hung up by Art Azevedo
! last year.
Ef Toro won the team champiOn
; ship for the fifth straight year, as
their three runners —Wright, Carley,
' and Hundley — finished second,
i fourth, and seventh, respectively.
I The Breakers, who finished second,
: also had three men in the first ten
i as, in addition to Morentin, Fullen
-1 wider was fifth and Cross was
; tenth.
Dick Wright and Dave Devlin
I staged a personal fight of their own
| for second place, with Wright finally
l winning out by a stride. These two
' also broke the old record, as they
! finished only about twenty yards
behind Morentin. The performance
of Morentin, Wright, and Devlin is
' particularly outstanding because of
1 the condition of the course: often,
due to the mud, the runners ap
peared to be wearing Dutch wooden
shoes, and at no time was the foot
-1 ing solid.
| Of the 23 men who started, 25
! finished, an exceptionally high num
i ber. Following are the names and
} ox-ganizations of the first ten: 1.
