## Stanford Exhibits Power in All Departments of the Game; California Scores on Interception 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
MURRAY CUDDEBACK'S Stanford Grays borrowed a few
U.S.C. (ricks Saturday, and used tliem to good advantage in triumphing
over a much-overrated California Reserve team hy a 25-6 score.
Neither team made a serious scoring threat in the first quarter, although
the Stanford line showed superior defensive ability. Starting the second
period, Stanford had a first down on California's 46-yard line, and from
this point the Grays marched straight to a touchdown. "Chuck" White's
L«»ujtiful 2.'1-yard run was the big spark of the advance, but another good

Elzo Van Dellen, finall.,*
| carried the ball over for the score.
Just before the end of the half,
1 Kantzner intercepted a Bear pass,
' and IHe Indians took the ball to the
; Bear 25-yard line. Minckler, using
I one of Ernie Pinckert's pel plays,
then carried the ball to the 4-yard
: line, and from there Oppenheim
jscored.
The Indians failed to score in the
third quarter, although they got,
i down to the Bear 9-yard line on one
occasion.
Oppenheim opened the fourth
quarter in spectacular fashion,
skirting his own left end for 55
yards and a touchdown. California
l then opened up with a passing at
tack, and one of the Bear tosses
was intercepted by Van Dellen, who
ran the ball back 65 yards to the
i California 4-yard line. Lipscomb
I went over left guard for a touch
down and followed it up with a con
version, and the score stood 25-0.
Pop Warner was among the five
j hundred spectators, and saw a num
; ber of players who may prove o£
I service to future varsities. Gruncky
i and Packard, both six feet four, will
! make a fine pair of ends for the
, 1932 varsity. The former has only
; one more year of competition, as he
' played for two seasons at Whittier,
where he was a first-string wing
man. Blanehard, center. Captain
Tarver and Alden, guards, and Mil
! ler, another end, played good steady
ball in the Indian line, while Van
, Dellen, White, Minckler, Stevens,
Lipscomb, Massey, Oppenheim, and
Spencer were all very effective in
i the backfield.
