New Champion
A new champion in the Rally
Committee vs. Bozo the bear fracas
made himself known yesterday in
the person of James E. Willis, Stan
ford alumnus of the Class of 03.
Willis, in a letter to Ed Boyles, com
mittee chairman, declared in short
that it is up to. the members of the
S.P.C.A.. to mind their own business
as far as this particular bear cub is
concerned. His letter follows:
Dear Ed:
My nephew, now at Stanford,
showed me the papers telling about
your predicament with the club
women over the bear cub. I don't
want to appear as a rabid, blood
thirsty old alumnus, but I was in
the Stanford-California gang fight
at the old 16th avenue and Valencia
street field in San Fx'ancisco after
the 1901 Big Game. I know how
those Berkeley muckers bought out
one of our players and got our sig
nals. We had Frank Slacker, all-
American fullback at the University
of Chicago the year before on our
team that day, but rain, mud, and
double-crossing Berkeley tactics
beat us 2 to 0. Consequently, boy, I
say do anything to anything or
everything that smells of Berkeley
and let the clubwomen be damned.
Sheriff Confirms Story
Sheriff Krager of Tulare county
will bear me out in what I have
said above as he was a tackle in
that game. I'm glad to see that the
spirit of the old Stanford we knew
is not dead. I wouldn't care if you
blasted the Campanile ofT the face
of the earth.
Yours very truly,
James E. Willis, '03
"As a safeguard against any ac
tion the S.P.C.A. may take against
us, we have asked certain members
of the law faculty to give us their
opinions on the matter," Boyles said.
"They have stated that cruelty must
be defined by human standards
alone, and that it is no more cruel
to jeer at a bear than it is to jeer
at a speaker.
"We have not yet definitely de
cided what we will finally do with
the bear."

My nephew, now at Stanford,
showed me the papers telling about
your predicament with the club
women over the bear cub. I don't
want to appear as a rabid, blood
thirsty old alumnus, but I was in
the Stanford-California gang fight
at the old 16th avenue and Valencia
street field in San Fx'ancisco after
the 1901 Big Game. I know how
those Berkeley muckers bought out
one of our players and got our sig
nals. We had Frank Slacker, all-
American fullback at the University
of Chicago the year before on our
team that day, but rain, mud, and
double-crossing Berkeley tactics
beat us 2 to 0. Consequently, boy, I
say do anything to anything or
everything that smells of Berkeley
and let the clubwomen be damned.
Sheriff Confirms Story
Sheriff Krager of Tulare county
will bear me out in what I have
said above as he was a tackle in
that game. I'm glad to see that the
spirit of the old Stanford we knew
is not dead. I wouldn't care if you
blasted the Campanile ofT the face
of the earth.
Yours very truly,
James E. Willis, '03
"As a safeguard against any ac
tion the S.P.C.A. may take against
us, we have asked certain members
of the law faculty to give us their
opinions on the matter," Boyles said.
"They have stated that cruelty must
be defined by human standards
alone, and that it is no more cruel
to jeer at a bear than it is to jeer
at a speaker.
"We have not yet definitely de
cided what we will finally do with
the bear."
