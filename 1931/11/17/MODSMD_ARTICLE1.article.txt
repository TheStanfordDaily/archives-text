# NO BOMBS AS BEAR INVADERS DEBATE CARDS
## Economic Crisis Is Subject Of No Decision Clash Here Last Night ONLY VERBAL BARRAGE Inflamed Tempers Are Only Result Of Meet 
### 
Stanford and California met, bat- j
tied, and parted last night.
Instead of the expected use of j
clubs and tear bombs with the re- ;
suiting list of casualties, the conflict
was one of words and the only in- j
juries sustained were damaged
characters and inflamed tempers :
caused by sarcastic inferences ban- ,
died without discrimination.
The besieged Stanford debaters
opened hostilities with a verbal
barrage by Abe MellinkofT. A vivid j
word-picture of the "trough of de
pression" to which the world has
fallen in the mad race of capitalists
imbued with the "sole idea of in
creasing their share of the profits in j
the world market" was Mellinkoff's
attack for the affirmative of the
question: "Resolved, that the present
world economic crisis constitutes a
major indictment of the capitalistic
system."
With the goal of the capitalist set
at "physical satisfaction of wants"
the fundamental basic purpose is the
profit motive, according to Mellin
kofT.

Human Nature Weak

A bombing of adjectives heralded
the approach of the besieging Cali
fornia host. Led by Karl Lawson,
the invaders aimed volleys of shots
at the "inherent and characteristic
weaknesses in human nature" with
defense of capitalism resting on 'the
fact that it remains but a "tool in
the hands of. man." The two driving
forces in man," self-assertion and
escape," lead him to the methods
he takes in realization of his aims.
Shock troops in the shape of John
Huneke and Joseph Wolfe drove
home the arguments proposed by
the affirmative for Stanford and
furthered the attack on the issue.
A "total lack of distribution into
the proper hands" and necessity of
elimination of the "profit motive"
were the gist of statements made
by Huneke. Joseph Wolfe, in his
position of relief corps for the Card
force, clinched the arguments in his
desperate attack on the capitalist by
a challenge to the opposition to dis
prove the item of "indicting capi
talism as a check on its power." A
plan of re-distribution of private
wealth as a means for "checking
spread of the usurping despot would
stabilize depression," according to
the theories advanced by Wolfe.
Rear-Guard Argues
The rear-guard of the invaders
spent valuable time on the explana
tion of "capitalism as a tool for
profiteers," and the fact that "so
cialism does not offer the freedom
for the individual which he desires."
This was especially true of Darwin
Brown while Robert Thurmond
argued for "betterment in individual
business as more desirable than bet
terment in group trade units."
Debate Tonight
The second of the debates will be
held tonight at Berkeley with op
ponents reversing sides on the ques
tion. Isador Botasof, Wayne Ban
nister, and William Kayo will jour
ney to California to present the
negative of the issue and review the
points made last night. A dinner
for. the visiting Stanford men will
be held in Stephen's Union in ap
preciation of the banquet held here
last night in the Union dining room.
