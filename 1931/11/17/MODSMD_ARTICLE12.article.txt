# BOOTH AND ROGERS ARE SECOND, THIRD IN S.F. SWIM MEET
## 
### 
Frank Booth of the Stanford varsity
splashers finished second to Ar
thur Hargraves of the Olympic Club
in the Pacific Association champion
ship 150-yard backstroke held Sun
day night in San Francisco. Bill
Rogers, freshman splasher specializ
ing in the backstroke event, pulled
in behind Booth to beat out Russell
Agnew of the Athens Club.
Hargraves' time was 1 minute, 45.7
seconds, slower than the present
Pacific Association record of 1:45:2,
held by Austin Clapp of the varsity.
A bit of interesting news for Stan
ford was manufactured when the
California water polo team held the
Olympic Club to a 2-2 tie. This gives
promise of a hard battle for the
varsity when the Blue and Gold is
encountered this season.
