Tickets for the Biff Game Gaieties
will be available at 1 o'clock today
in front of the Women's Clubhouse,
and in Palo Alto at Keeble's. The
tickets this year are priced from
$1.00 to $1.50, with a large block
selling at $1.25. Roughs must pro
duce the usual 75 cents.
A treat is in store for those who
attend the Gaieties, in the person
of Bernhard Springer, who is of
fering a dance specialty number.
Springer is a German student who
is attending Stanford and is well
versed in many types of dancing.
His interpretations are mirth-pro
voking and show skill in their exe
cution.
Specially Act
Another specialty act of interest
is that of George Shibley's. Shibley
may be remembered for his part as
the French waiter in "Mardi Gras"
and also as the chieftain in the
''Devil and the Cheese." This act
promises to be one of the best spe
cialties in Ram's Head history, and
Helvenston is very enthusiastic
about the whole prospect.

A permanent set has been ar
ranged in levels where the various
acts take place, and is designed to
give maximum playing space. Sim
plicity is the rule for the back
ground, including a . few properties
and perhaps a small, three-fold, re
versible screen arrangement with
suggested backgrounds painted on
either side. Four skits will be fea
tured with this arrangement.
European Note
A European note is effected in the
light-colored scenery, producing a
simple yet plastic background for
light, color, and movement. This
simplicity naturally inspires the
modern treatment which has been
kept sane rather than bizarre and
fantastic.
