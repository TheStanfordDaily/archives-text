## Dilley Is Famous Authority On Modern Puppetry 
### 
On a diminutive stage, amid rich
i and fantastic scenery, Perry Dilley's
famous puppets will enact two plays
j this evening in the Assembly Hall
I at 7:30. The performance is open to
j the public.
Dilley, who is considered one of
I the leading puppet artists of our
j time, will present for the Stanford
| audience "The Three Wishes," built
| on an old legend, and "The Emper
! or's New Clothes," a modern satire.
1 The wooden actors will be "played,"
jor o eprated and spoken for, by
j Grace Stearns and Grace Wickham.
! These puppets have entertained
; more than 100,000 people since Dil
| ley began his performances at the
University of California in 1922. His
productions have been shown in
| dozens of colleges and hundreds of
schools throughout the West. Dil
ley has taught the art of puppetry
and has written numerous books and
magazine articles on the subject.

Dilley is an authority on the hand
, puppet, the puppet without strings,
i He was one of the first to build and
i exhibit this kind of figure in the
! United States. He and his assistants
; together have at their command
j more than four dozen "voices" for
: the different characters of their
; troupe, and he has a repertory of 13
i plays.
Perry Dilley says that "the art
i of puppetry combines in a quaint
j manner the principles of drama,
music, and folklore. It uses the
| principles of theatre-art in a bold
j and simple way. But it is far from
being a mere imitation of the big
| stage. This miniature art of the
theatre occupies somewhat the posi-
I tion in relation to the stage that the
modern wood-cut does to painting.
