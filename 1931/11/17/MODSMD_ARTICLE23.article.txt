an attack on the gigantic Big Game bonfire, a constant

the environs of the barbed-wire fence surrounding the structure and will
be continuous until Wednesday night.

After routing about 45 California invaders in their attempt to set off
the blaze at :>:45 yesterday morning. Bill YVerder and Marvic Kalin, in
charge of the workers, prepared for a return attack by Californians hoping
to make up their defeat. Stanford freshmen defending against the in-

vasion were positive in their dec
larations that they recognized at
least four California freshman foot

Cathcart's Statement
Professor Arthur M. Cathcart,
acting head of the University in Dr.
Swain's absence, issued the follow
ing statement yesterday:
"In the absence of Dr. Swain, who
will return next Friday, the Presi
dent's office will initiate no action
in regard to the reported recent
violations of the intercollegiate
agreement relating to campus inva
sions, whether by Stanford students
or those of the University of Cali
fornia. The reports are serious, of
course, and call for investigation by
both institutions. It is. assumed that
such investigations will be made.
Dr. Swain will doubtless give the
matter his attention on his return."
Dr. Sproul, president of the Uni
versity of California, refused i<>
make any statement regarding the
affair.
Five Frosh Hurt
During the fracas yesterday, five
Stanford men were painfully injured
and several others received slight
injuries. These are: Thomas Collins,
broken nose; Alfred Abrahamsen,
cuts and bruises; James Mullen,
injured eye; Harry Coty, face
wounds; and Samuel Barclay, cuts
and bruises. Instead of using hands
only in the fray, the invaders are
said to have employed clubs and
bottles in attempting to subdue ihe
guard. However, the siren, which
was immediately sounded, brought
forth several hundred men, and the
raiders fled. Gordon Hampton was
first to give the alarm when the
U.C. students approached near the
structure. Police had previously
warned the watchers of a group of
cars parked near the campus.

Only two boards were ignited,
and they were soon extinguished.
A serious hand-to-hand encounter
took place before this was accom
plished with the aid of a campus
fire engine, however. Using a system
by which two men worked together
on each guard, while the third in
each small group attempted to start
a blaze, the trespassers were almost
successful in their attempt.
"Eye for Eye"
In last night's .meeting, Werdcr
and Kahn told tho assembled fresh
men that in view of the battle they
should attempt to avoid the use of
weapons in the event of another af
fair, but should it become necessary,
to give the opponents everything
they asked for. Bob Atkinson and
Gene Mires assisted in the plans.
Although - the ruling of Women's
Council prohibits women from serv
ing the men, ample supplies of
sandwiches, doughnuts, and coffec
have been provided for the guards,
i! was announced. All roads lead
ing to the pyre will be watched
constantly, and special wires have j
been installed from the field to \
Marvie Kahn's room where he will
be warned immediately if anything 1
is sighted during the night.

the blaze at :>:45 yesterday morning. Bill YVerder and Marvic Kalin, in

Cathcart's Statement
Professor Arthur M. Cathcart,
acting head of the University in Dr.
Swain's absence, issued the follow
ing statement yesterday:
"In the absence of Dr. Swain, who
will return next Friday, the Presi
dent's office will initiate no action
in regard to the reported recent
violations of the intercollegiate
agreement relating to campus inva
sions, whether by Stanford students
or those of the University of Cali
fornia. The reports are serious, of
course, and call for investigation by
both institutions. It is. assumed that
such investigations will be made.
Dr. Swain will doubtless give the
matter his attention on his return."
Dr. Sproul, president of the Uni
versity of California, refused i<>
make any statement regarding the
affair.
Five Frosh Hurt
During the fracas yesterday, five
Stanford men were painfully injured
and several others received slight
injuries. These are: Thomas Collins,
broken nose; Alfred Abrahamsen,
cuts and bruises; James Mullen,
injured eye; Harry Coty, face
wounds; and Samuel Barclay, cuts
and bruises. Instead of using hands
only in the fray, the invaders are
said to have employed clubs and
bottles in attempting to subdue ihe
guard. However, the siren, which
was immediately sounded, brought
forth several hundred men, and the
raiders fled. Gordon Hampton was
first to give the alarm when the
U.C. students approached near the
structure. Police had previously
warned the watchers of a group of
cars parked near the campus.

Only two boards were ignited,
and they were soon extinguished.
A serious hand-to-hand encounter
took place before this was accom
plished with the aid of a campus
fire engine, however. Using a system
by which two men worked together
on each guard, while the third in
each small group attempted to start
a blaze, the trespassers were almost
successful in their attempt.
"Eye for Eye"
In last night's .meeting, Werdcr
and Kahn told tho assembled fresh
men that in view of the battle they
should attempt to avoid the use of
weapons in the event of another af
fair, but should it become necessary,
to give the opponents everything
they asked for. Bob Atkinson and
Gene Mires assisted in the plans.
Although - the ruling of Women's
Council prohibits women from serv
ing the men, ample supplies of
sandwiches, doughnuts, and coffec
have been provided for the guards,
i! was announced. All roads lead
ing to the pyre will be watched
