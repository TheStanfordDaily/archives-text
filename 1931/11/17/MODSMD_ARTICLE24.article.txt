# Bozo The Bear Will Arrive On Campus Today
## New Mascot Not To Be In Parade--Boyles 
### 
Bozo the bear, guest of honor at
the Big Game rally in the Pavilion
tomorrow night, will arrive today,
according to word received last
night by Ed Boyles, Rally Commit
tee chairman. He will be taken im
mediately to the Family Farm,
where he will be in the custody of
the Rally Committee until time for
his appearance at the celebration.
"We will waive all protests and
go ahead with our plans to exhibit
the bear, regardless of conse
quences," Boyles declaimed. "We will
not use Bozo in the parade, how
ever, because of the danger of ex
citing him so that he would be un
manageable on the Pavilion stage."
Early Dinner
At a meeting of the Rally Com
mittee last night it was decided io
ask all eating organizations on the
campus to set ahead the dinner hour
tomorrow night to 6 o'clock, since
the torchlight parade, led by the
band, will begin before 7 o'clock.
The band will form near Encina at
about 6:30, and will march up be
tween that hall and Toyon, arriving
at the Fiji corner about 6:50 o'clock.
The procession, lighted by red rail
road flares, will proceed at once
down the Row and over to the
Pavilion, where the rally program
will begin immediately. No automo
biles will be used in the parade, it
was announced.
Pavilion Open at 7
The Pavilion doors will be opened
at 7 o'clock to those presenting
tickets, Charlie Karl, chairman of
the rally, said last night. These
tickets will be issued to alumni and
other interested outsiders at ihe
Alumni and A.S.S.U. offices today
and tomorrow.
It is planned to fill the entire
Pavilion floor before allowing any
one to enter the side stands. The
rally program will be limited to a
half an hour, ending with the talk
of Dan Evans, widely known alumni
pep speaker, after which the crowd
will migrate to the bonfire for the
formal lighting.
