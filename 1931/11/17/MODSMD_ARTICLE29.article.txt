# MEET MR. MONTEAGLE

### 
The Daily has protested before against the flagrant dis
torting hv metropolitan papers of news stories out of the
Stanford campus. Yesterday this school was treated to a
splendid example of how happenings on the Stanford cam
pus are twisted to make better copy.
The San Francisco Call-Bulletin, sensational Hearst
sheet, and Fred Monteagle, its Stanford correspondent,
combined to add a few fantastic touches to the story of the
bonfire raid, in order to catch a few more customers.
Mr. Monteagle, who is a senior in the University, has
been in unofficial hot water before for distorting stories.
The "underground tunnel swimming pool" and "co-eds ex
pelled for scalping" were partially produced by his fertile
brain. Mr. Monteagle is paid on space, and a highly sensa
tional story, true or not, earns him a few extra nickels. Of
course, it may reflect unfavorably on the University in
which he is enrolled, but what does that matter?
At all events, yesterday's Call-Bulletin carried the fol
lowing story of the raid, under an eight-column, two-line
streamer:
"Five students are in the hospital, a dozen others were
hurt and several co-eds fled in panic when a hundred Uni
versity of California students raided the Stanford campus
early today. . . .
"The battle, in which gasoline bombs were hurled and
improvised clubs used freely on both sides, may cause a
severance of athletic relations between the two univer
sities.
"Several co-eds, who had been furnishing the guards
with coffee and doughnuts, fled screaming. . . .
"Aroused by the siren, the police squad reached the spot
and broke lip the battle. . . ."
So says the Call-Bulletin. Mr. Monteagle was there, and
he ought to know. Unfortunately, there were other people
there, too, and everyone who was there too swears (1)
there wasn't a co-ed any closer to the bonfire than Roble;
(2) not a policeman showed his head on the scene before,
during or after the battle. Also, any suggestion that ath
letic relations between Stanford and California might be
severed are original with Mr. Monteagle and the Call-Bul
lelin, nothing to that effect having been reported from the
authorities of either institution.
Of course, there weren't any co-eds and there weren't
any policemen. But co-eds always add spice to a story, and
riot squads help it along, too, so why not put it in?
If this had been the first time that Mr. Monteagle and
Company had done something like that, it wouldn't be so
bad. But this is not the first, or the second or the tenth.
It's a regular occurrence, and Stanford readers are getting
plenty tired of it.
The Daily editorial column, of course, is not to be used
for personal quarrels. The writer feels, however, that the
foregoing is justified at this time because all those ques
tioned have commented adversely on the Call-Bulletin's
story. Nevertheless, his signature will go below this edi
torial, inasmuch as it is purely his personal opinion.
