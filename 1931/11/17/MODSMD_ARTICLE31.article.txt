# BULL SESSION
## THEY'RE IN AND THEY'RE OUT 
### 
To the Hull Session:
Not that those exposes of the
world-outside-our- walls aren't
interesting in their \>«y- Rut it
seems to me, Hull Sessions
should touch on things closer to
home than the antics of the
in Washington, I).C. in real life
they do. How about some more
dope on the "500"?
The fellow who ran Bull Ses
sion before you, did win im
mortal fame, not by being caus
tic about international debts, but |
by dubbing Rohle the Bastille.
Why can't you?
If there's anything that comes
closer to the home campus than
the subject of Studies, excepting
perhaps the Opposite Sex and
Sports, I don't know what it is,
and you don't either, probably.
What freshman student wouldn't
like to know if bis four years ,
at school would be well-spent j
or wasted? Not that it would
make much difference anyway.
Also from that standpoint, what
frosh wouldn't want to know
whether it was better to go 1o
college or to work? Words by
the gallon have been spilled and
writings by the ton have been
printed on this same subject, but
as with religion, it still seems to
be a matter of individual opinion
and not of collective science.
Sincerely yours,
William Rubens
Mr. Rubens then goes on to give ;
a discussion of the Carnegie report j
on what colleges tudents know which I
will appear in Bull Session some- j
time in the very near future.
The Bull Session is and has been ]
cognizant of the fact for some time j
that students are more interested in
a host of other topics besides poli
tics. A meeting with "her" is more
interesting than any Republican or

' Democratic Convention. The teams
that spoil down on a plot of grass
near where the Embarcadero meets
the Highway is more vital to the
campus than the runnings around
of several thousands of troops in
the dreary wastes of Manchuria.
Realizing this, more than three
fifths of all Bull Sessions deal with
campus or closely related subjects.
The remaining blurbs do try to
cover Life with a larger "L" from
the student viewpoint. Everyone has
his own peculiar way of saving the
! world; some think mass education
is the way; others feel revolution is
needed; but this writer feels that
the only solution to the world's ills
: and more particularly national evils
j is by the participating in public af
| fairs by educated people—especially
i before they get too old to think that
j everything that is, is great.
With this idea in mind, the Buli
i Session has felt that to acquaint
j those that read this strip (and some
I do, judging from the unprintable
[ criticism v/e get by letter and con
; versation) with seme of the things
I that are going on would not be out
lof place. More particularly, if a
critical as opposed to a cynical or a
■ Rotarian attitude can be developed
j in a few students, this writer will
| beam with that inward satisfaction
j that can only come to those who try
| to initiate new orders, even though
! among but a handful of Stanford
! University students.
As regards giving advice on the
i value of a college education, we
[ have many times given our opinion
1 on that question. By mixing up the
j questions discussed — sometimes
j dealing with ones that refer to
j things happening IN the University;
i and other times using things hap
pening OUT of the University, we
feel the best interests of everybody
concerned can be met.

To the Hull Session:
Not that those exposes of the
world-outside-our- walls aren't
interesting in their \>«y- Rut it
seems to me, Hull Sessions
should touch on things closer to
home than the antics of the
in Washington, I).C. in real life
they do. How about some more
dope on the "500"?
The fellow who ran Bull Ses
sion before you, did win im
mortal fame, not by being caus
tic about international debts, but |
by dubbing Rohle the Bastille.
Why can't you?
If there's anything that comes
closer to the home campus than
the subject of Studies, excepting
perhaps the Opposite Sex and
Sports, I don't know what it is,
and you don't either, probably.
What freshman student wouldn't
like to know if bis four years ,
at school would be well-spent j
or wasted? Not that it would
make much difference anyway.
Also from that standpoint, what
frosh wouldn't want to know
whether it was better to go 1o
college or to work? Words by
the gallon have been spilled and
writings by the ton have been
printed on this same subject, but
as with religion, it still seems to
be a matter of individual opinion
and not of collective science.
Sincerely yours,

Mr. Rubens then goes on to give ;
a discussion of the Carnegie report j
on what colleges tudents know which I
will appear in Bull Session some- j
time in the very near future.
The Bull Session is and has been ]
cognizant of the fact for some time j
that students are more interested in
a host of other topics besides poli
tics. A meeting with "her" is more
interesting than any Republican or

' Democratic Convention. The teams
that spoil down on a plot of grass
near where the Embarcadero meets
the Highway is more vital to the
campus than the runnings around
of several thousands of troops in
the dreary wastes of Manchuria.
Realizing this, more than three
fifths of all Bull Sessions deal with
campus or closely related subjects.
The remaining blurbs do try to
cover Life with a larger "L" from
the student viewpoint. Everyone has
his own peculiar way of saving the
! world; some think mass education
is the way; others feel revolution is
needed; but this writer feels that
the only solution to the world's ills
: and more particularly national evils
j is by the participating in public af
| fairs by educated people—especially
i before they get too old to think that
j everything that is, is great.
With this idea in mind, the Buli
i Session has felt that to acquaint
j those that read this strip (and some
I do, judging from the unprintable
[ criticism v/e get by letter and con
; versation) with seme of the things
I that are going on would not be out
