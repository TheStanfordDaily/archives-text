The Editor, Sir:
As the great-grandson of a minis- I
tcr of the gospel, I have been most j
pleased by the piety and devotion of !
our Stanford debaters. I refer par- :
ticularly to Mr. Shibley, who, in the I
late Oxford debate, so reverently j
connected his argument with the!
life and teachings of Christ, and to (
Mr. Bloom, who but yesternight in j
devout and scholarly fashion, ]
brought all the weight of the divine |
commands to bear with his argu- 1
mentsâ€”a method especially apt in |
view of his opponents and the deep- |
ly deligious nature of the Stanford ;
audience. Permit me to urge a more |
conscientious attendance at our de
bates by the student body. Quite |
apart from the mental stimulation |
derived from the logic of our oppon
ents, the religious instruction re- ,
ceived from our own fine debaters
will be of incalculable value.
Sincerely,
Hal von Breton
I
