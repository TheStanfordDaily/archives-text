TOO MANY COOKS—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Good .... it's got to be good—
Burt Wheeler fecit.
Wheeler and Dorothy Lee appear
together again in scenes of touch
ing comedy and comic tragedy.
Sharon Lynn and Hallam Cooley,
representing the somewhat, but not
much more, sophisticated love in
terest, are equally "taking."
A New York dramatic critic has
computed that a good comedy should
produce 1.6 laughs a minute. Hav
ing counted the laughs at ' Too
Many Cooks" we are able to an
nounce that there were 1.8 a min
ute." Perhaps the extra .2 is ac
counted for by the fact that we
attended a kiddie matinee.
Now we are going to take our
marbles and go home and wait until
another good comedy corties to
town. —E.T.P.
