With two touchdowns made in the
closing minutes of each half Stan
ford's victory over the Nevada
Wolves reminded one of the U.C.L.A.
game two weeks before. Although
the outcome of Saturday's contest
was never iri doubt, the score could
have just as well been 13 to 0 in
favor of Stanford just as the score
of the Bruin contest nearly ended
in a (J to (J tie.
Sadly enough, this further in
dicates that Stanford's scoring
strength is exceptionally weak
this season. Saturday's score
should have been in the 40's
when it is considered that the
reserves made nearly 4<K» yards
from scrimmage.
This weakness in the Stanford of
fense was equally apparent at the
beginning of the season when in the
last half of the Santa Clara game
the Big Red Machine traveled yards
and yards through the Broncos but
was able to score only once.
Again in the U.C.L.A. tilt the
Card attack could not penetrate
within scoring distance. And
this is the first year since Pop
Warner has heen at Stanford
that the Indians have not been
able to set within 10 yards of
U.S.C.'s goal line.
The Nevada Wolves made one
serious threat to score on the Cards
last Saturday in the middle of the
fourth quarter. A series of passes
from Towle to Griffin and Bloedell
and a couple of long gains through
the line brought the ball to the
four-yard line, The attack was start
ed on Nevada's 26-yard line, making
it a drive of more than 70 yards.
But the Indian defense tightened,
and Nevada lacked inches of making
it a first, down.
Outside of this sudden march
the Nevadans could do nothing
against Stanford, playing an en
entirely defensive game, Griffith
at fullback and lVfonorovich and
Beemer in the line were out
standing in stopping the Indians
whenever they were stopped.
