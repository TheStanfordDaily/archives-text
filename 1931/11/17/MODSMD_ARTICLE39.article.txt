# Intramural Grid Leaders Maintain Positions
## ALPHA DELTS AND SIGMA CHIS STILL TIED AS BOTH WIN Phi Delts Win Over Phi Delta Phi In Overtime Battle, 2-0 
### Bob Wade 
Three injuries in the first three
plays of the game and a punt blocked
on their seven-yard line proved too
much for the Phi Delta Phi outfit
yesterday as they lost to the Phi
Delts in an overtime struggle, 2-0.
Neither team was able to take the
wet ball up the field for any ap
preciable gain. The Row-men were
unable to push it over after the
blocked punt, and the lawyers lost
it on downs on the enemy 12-yard
line.
Case Outstanding
Case was the outstanding ball
toter for the Phi Delts, and con
tributed most of the yards gained
in the overtime period.
Pulling their old reliable "sleeper
play" for the nth time, the Sig Chis,
defending intramural champions,
managed to stay at the top of League
II with a 12-6 victory over the
S.A.E.'s.
Waterman galloped 80 yards for
the score after taking a pass from
Larsen, in the middle of the first
half.
Their second score was the result
of a 70-yard march down the field,
and Larsen's short toss to Wheeler.
The S.A.E.'s tallied when Shidler
pulled down a Sig Chi pass and
raced 30 yards to score.
Alpha Delts Win
Keeping step with the Sigma Chi
outfit, with whom they are tied, the
Alpha Delts handed the Los Arcos
team a 13-0 setback.
Bartlett went around right end 15
yards for the first score and Naylon
intercepted a Club pass on the 50-
yard marker and scored from there.
Registering their one score on a
30-yard pass from Magee to Miles,
the Theta Xi team triumphed over
the D.U.'s (5-0.
