Frosh Finish Strong
Although presenting a season rec- |
jord that was anything but scintillat- !
I ing, the Stanford freshmen ended in
j a blaze of glory when they held the
I Bear Cubs to a 1-1 tie Saturday j
j morning.
In the first game of the Little Big
j Series the yearlings suffered a 5-1
! setback, and were favored to repeat j
1 in the second. However, plenty of l
i fight and a vastly improved offense
; served to not only hold the Cali- ,
fornia freshmen down but give them
a lucky draw. Next year's varsity 1
1 will have plenty of good material
: from which to choose its replace
ments.

There will be no 1931 vintage
champagne. The cold weather of
August and September ruined the
grape crop.
