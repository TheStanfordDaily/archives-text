# Grays' Superb Line Play Bodes Well For Future
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Because of the ability shown by '
j the hard-running set of backs in
j the Gray lineup, it would not be
! surprising to see half a dozen of
this year's reserve backfield men on
the varsity roster next year.
Coach Murray Cuddeback can say
with pride that his team has been
j the most successful Cardinal foot
i ball aggregation of this year, for
i the Stanford Grays, composed of
men who are ineligible or who failed
I to make the varsity, did not lose a '
! game Phis season. True, the reserves
i played only two scheduled contests;
j but these resulted in scores of 25-li
j against the strong California Goofs
I and 12-G over the San Francisco
| University reserves.
Saturday's contest against Cali- i
fornia showed the fine blocking and
i tackling ability of the line. The work
|of Grunsky, Packard, and Miller,
i ends, rivalled that of any of the
| varsity ends except Tod and Colvin.

'These men continually spilled the
Blue and Gold interference to smash
the Goof plays.
| Chuck White and Elzo Van Dellen
i were the best of the Indian backs.
Although several good flat passes
j were completed during the Califor
nia game, most of the Grays' yard
age was piled up by running plays.
California's lone touchdown was
made against a group of second
| and third-string players. Cuddeback
j used almost forty players in the
I fracas.
Fans who watched the Grays this
j year were much surprised to see
| the reserves come out of the huddle
; and go into a typical U.S.C. forma
j tion. The Jones system was used be
| cause the main purpose of the Gray
! team was to furnish the varsity with
j a chance to practice against U.S.C.
plays and formations. Since the re
serves had no time to learn any
other plays, the U.S.C. style of play
was used in th<?ir scheduled games.
