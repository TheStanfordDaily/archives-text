# Phil Moffatt May Play In Big Game, Out For Practice
## Stanford Stock Advanced by Appearance of "Phancy Phil"; Pop Must Still Depend Mainly on Hardy and Afflerbaugh at Left Half 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
Stanford stock advanced a point yesterday when Phil Moffatt ap
peared at practice in a uniform for the first time since the U.S.C. crash.
The hard-luck halfback did little but jog around the field in an attempt
to warm up his injured leg, hut nevertheless his appearance gave added
strength to the rumors that Phil may he used in the Big Game.
Whatever the case may be, it seems probable that Warner will be
forced to depend mainly on Spud Hardy and Kenny Afflerbaugh for his

■ left half-backs next Saturday. Mof
fatt's ability is unquestioned, but
when one realizes that he has had
very little actual service this year
and that he will not have sufficient
time to round into shape by Satur
day, it is obvious that Phil's worth
against California must be dis
counted.
liintala Out of Hospital
Rintala and Aifierbaugh, who have
been nursing bad colds, were re
leased from the hospital but did not
don uniforms.
The remainder of the squad un
derwent an extended practice that
lasted until six o'clock, in which
light dummy scrimmage and work
on the machines formed the main
event. Warner's program this week
: apparently is confined to light pol
ishing off on team play plus the
never-ending work on perfection of
the fundamentals.
Meanwhile, Blue and Gold sup
porters appear considerably cheered
by the return of George Watkins,
demon punter. Canny Bill Ingram is
evidently in a state of nervous agi
tation because his team is reigning
favorite over Stanford. Ingram
draws heavily upon the good old
fight talk and depends on the psy
chological element to aid in his vic
tories.
When his team is on top, it be
| comes a more difficult problem to
j instill that do or die spirit. So Sai
j lor William has apparently sent the
word around to the bay city sports
writers that California looked hope
lessly in the rut against Idaho.
