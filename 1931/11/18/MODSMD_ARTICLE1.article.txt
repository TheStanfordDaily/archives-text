# INDIAN PASSING CRUCIAL POINT AGAINST BEARS
## Straight Manpower Frees Ingram's Line From Fear Of Wet Field PHIL MAY SEE PLAY Afflerbaugh, Rintala Back In Usual Positions 
### Dick Rodda 
With weather conditions continu- j
ing to favor California, Stanford's '
chances of repeating the 1929 Big
Game upset Saturday may depend j
on a running attack which so far
has not shown power inside the 20-
yard line.
The Indian's chief scoring threat, |
a flashy passing attack, would be |
greatly handicapped by a wet field, I
as proved the case in both the I
Washington and U.S.C. games. If I
the weather man gives Stanford a j
wet ball Saturday, the Indian power ,
attack will have to function as it i
hasn't functioned yet this season to
penetrate that stubborn defense of j
the Bears.
Evidently with this in mind, Pop
Warner devoted yesterday's secret |
session to an intensive drill on of- j
fense, without, however, resorting to ;
scrimmage.
Cal Not Deceptive
California's offense is, as usual, )
far from deceptive. Bill Ingram, as
did Nibs Price, is relying largely on :
straight man power, and wet weath- j
er would not be a handicap to the j
Berkeley eleven.
Meanwhile Ingram is working his j
team hard to smooth out defects j
shown in the Idaho game last Satur
day. According to reports from i
Berkeley, the Bears again scrim
maged last night, with even the j
"cripples" taking part.
After being dogged by more than j
his share of injuries all season, Navy
Bill finds all his key men available |
for play Saturday. Castro, his big j
fullback, who pulled a tendon in the j
Washington game, was back in uni- I
form last night and will be in the i
starting lineup.
Bears to Use Best
The official starting lineup an- !
nounced at the Berkeley camp last j
night indicates that the Bears will 1
open the game with their most pow- |
erful line combination and one of |
their best backfield quartets.
Watkins, quick-kicking left half- !
back, is on the mend and is ex- j
pected to play, although Shaldach |
will start. Since the two are about i
a standoff, it is certain that the post j
will be well taken care of.
Gill, who was slightly injured in ,
the Idaho tilt, is ready to start at
right half. Smith, however, will j
open at quarterback instead of Kir- j
win, first-stringer.
All regular linemen will be at i
their posts, with Stone and Di Resta, |
ends, Ilansome and Tozer, tackles, j
Carlson and McArthur, guards, and 1
Medanich, center.
Hardy May Be Half
No official Stanford lineup has j
been announced, but it is fairly cer- j
tain that the combination named in j
Monday's Daily will open. Phil
Moffatt, if able to play, would fol- !
low Hardy into the fray, with Afller- j
baugh in reserve.
"Phancy Phil" again participated
in signal practice last night, bul 1
since he has been kept on the bench j
for most of the season with injuries, i
it is not likely that he will be able \
to play for any length of time.
With the return of Afflerbaugh >
and Rintala, who have been confined !
to fhe hospital with colds, the rest I
of the Stanford squad ife in good j
physical shape.
According to present plans, War
ner and the Indian varsity will go !
into seclusion at the Woodside fam- ;
ily farm after the rally tonight.

has not shown power inside the 20-
yard line.
The Indian's chief scoring threat, |
a flashy passing attack, would be |
greatly handicapped by a wet field, I
as proved the case in both the I
Washington and U.S.C. games. If I
the weather man gives Stanford a j
wet ball Saturday, the Indian power ,
attack will have to function as it i
hasn't functioned yet this season to
penetrate that stubborn defense of j
the Bears.
Evidently with this in mind, Pop
Warner devoted yesterday's secret |
session to an intensive drill on of- j
fense, without, however, resorting to ;
scrimmage.
Cal Not Deceptive
California's offense is, as usual, )
far from deceptive. Bill Ingram, as
did Nibs Price, is relying largely on :
straight man power, and wet weath- j
er would not be a handicap to the j
Berkeley eleven.
Meanwhile Ingram is working his j
team hard to smooth out defects j
shown in the Idaho game last Satur
day. According to reports from i
Berkeley, the Bears again scrim
maged last night, with even the j
"cripples" taking part.
After being dogged by more than j
his share of injuries all season, Navy
Bill finds all his key men available |
for play Saturday. Castro, his big j
fullback, who pulled a tendon in the j
Washington game, was back in uni- I
form last night and will be in the i
starting lineup.
Bears to Use Best
The official starting lineup an- !
nounced at the Berkeley camp last j
night indicates that the Bears will 1
open the game with their most pow- |
erful line combination and one of |
their best backfield quartets.
Watkins, quick-kicking left half- !
back, is on the mend and is ex- j
pected to play, although Shaldach |
will start. Since the two are about i
a standoff, it is certain that the post j
will be well taken care of.
Gill, who was slightly injured in ,
the Idaho tilt, is ready to start at
right half. Smith, however, will j
open at quarterback instead of Kir- j
win, first-stringer.
All regular linemen will be at i
their posts, with Stone and Di Resta, |
ends, Ilansome and Tozer, tackles, j
Carlson and McArthur, guards, and 1
Medanich, center.
Hardy May Be Half
No official Stanford lineup has j
been announced, but it is fairly cer- j
tain that the combination named in j
Monday's Daily will open. Phil
Moffatt, if able to play, would fol- !
low Hardy into the fray, with Afller- j
baugh in reserve.
"Phancy Phil" again participated
in signal practice last night, bul 1
since he has been kept on the bench j
for most of the season with injuries, i
it is not likely that he will be able \
to play for any length of time.
With the return of Afflerbaugh >
and Rintala, who have been confined !
to fhe hospital with colds, the rest I
of the Stanford squad ife in good j
physical shape.
According to present plans, War
ner and the Indian varsity will go !
into seclusion at the Woodside fam- ;
ily farm after the rally tonight.
With weather conditions continu- j
ing to favor California, Stanford's '
chances of repeating the 1929 Big
Game upset Saturday may depend j
on a running attack which so far
has not shown power inside the 20-
yard line.
