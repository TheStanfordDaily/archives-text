# Anson Weeks' Band To Play For Jolly-Up
## Final Pep Rally Will Be Friday Afternoon 
### 
Anson Weeks, famous San Fran
cisco dance maestro whose music
has made Peacock Court a Stanford
mecca, will trek to the campus Fri
day afternoon with his entire 14-
piece band to play in the Pavilion
for an all-University rally jolly-up.
The cheering-dancing celebration
will last from 3:30 to 5 o'clock, with
Yell Leader Larry Harris and his
assistants presiding during the in
termissions.
The announcement of the affair
was made last night by Marian
Hawlett and Bill Campbell, who are
handling the arrangements for the
Rally Committee. Weeks has offered
to play free of charge at a Stanford
rally, they said, because of a desire
to help along the build-up of Big
Game spirit here.
It was largely through the inter
est and co-operation of Griff Wil
liams, former Stanford student and
now pianist in the Weeks orchestra,
that the appearance of the famous
band on the campus in this manner
was assured.
"It is up. to the student body to
show its appreciation to Anson
Weeks for his generous offer by
turning out and making the rally
jolly-up a success," Campbell de
clared. "The affair will come at an
ideal time to work up enthusiasm
for the game to a high pitch, and
the whole campus ought to be there.
"Weeks will be here in person,
with his regular Mark Hopkins or
chestraâ€”not a band of substitutes.
It will be the best rally jolly-up that
the school has seen for a long time,
and we want a full house."
No admission will be charged, and
members of the Rally Committee
will be in charge.
