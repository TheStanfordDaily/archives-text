Enthusiasm High
"If this school doesn't get cut
| there and show more pep tonight |
i than it has all year, then I never |
expect to look the old Stanford
spirit in the eye again," Ed Boyles, i
; Rally Committee chairan, declared
! last night. "But from all indications j
j the house will be jammed."
The celebration will begin at (1:40

>lish corner, the rally program proper I
• will start. The team will come on :
! the stage in a body, after which the i
| giant drum will be presented in the j
care of the Scalpers Society, official j
| guards.
Then will come the official en- I
I trance of Bozo the bear, with ap- |
I propriate ceremony. After his dis- j

i the speech by Dan Evans will close '
j the program.

Alumni and A.S.S.U. offices.
"The unanimity of school spirit J
j should never be more manifest than
i at Big Game time," Boyles declared. j
I "We .hope that spirit will prevail j
I to the utmost tonight."

TRADITION DECREES, the Stanford student body will turn out
tonight to make its annual plea to the good sods of football for another
swell bearskin to tack on the wall. There could be 110 better way in
which to offer up th«se prayers than the one planned by the Rally Com
mittee. There will be a torchlight parade, marching behind the band
down the Row. There will be Dan Evans, one of the best light talkers
Stanford ever turned out. There will be a short, snappy program on the

"Pavilion Stage. There will be Bozo
| the hear. And then there will be
! the Big Game bonfire.
Enthusiasm High
"If this school doesn't get cut
| there and show more pep tonight |
i than it has all year, then I never |
expect to look the old Stanford
spirit in the eye again," Ed Boyles, i
; Rally Committee chairan, declared
! last night. "But from all indications j
j the house will be jammed."
The celebration will begin at (1:40
j at Encina, when the band will leave j
j Encina in formation to lead the

i parade toward the Row. The route j
| will lead past the Chi Psi house to
the Row, and then up to the Fiji !
' corner, where the first contingent j
' will meet a delegation from Sequoia
j with the coffin.
Parade Starts
At 6:50 the assembled paraders, {
led by the band, will start down i
the Row, carrying the coffin sur- J
