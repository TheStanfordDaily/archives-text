Legal action against the Stanford
Rally Committee if they attempt to'
exhibit Bozo the much-discussed
bear at the Big Game rally in the
Pavilion tonight was promised yes
terday by Mrs. Bruce Joyce in a
second letter to Ed Boylcs, chair
man. In a furious tirade against the
proposed "barbaric antics" of those
in charge, Mrs. Joyce caustically
comments on Stanford's "veneer of
I civilization, her selfishness."
The letter follows:
Dear Mr. Boyles:
I certainly want to compliment
i you and your committee on your
j very gentlemanly treatment of the
feelings of a defenseless woman, to
1 say nothing of your astonishing at
; titude toward a poor, dumb animal,
i It smacks of the dark ages, not of
the intelligence of this enlightened
j era in which you and your student
i body are living and in which you

by your own election claim to be the j
upper 15 per cent.
Upper 15 per cent! You with your
airs of superiority, your veneer of
civilization, your selfishness, who ,
call it collegiate to be barbaric! Yes. ;
I say barbaric. 1 call you fiends. I |
defy you to abuse, to beat, to jeer
a defenseless bear just because lie .
is the symbol of a rival school.
The idea of you adopting the atti- |
tude that "cruelty must be defined
by human standards." No doubt J
cannibalism stands by those who j
practice it upon a similar rationali- '
zation. 1 tell you, you are no less |
than barbaric cannibals yourselves j
if you go through with the killing 1
of Bozo as the papers none too dis- j
crectly imply.
This is my last warning. If Bozo
is exhibited I shall take legal action j
against you.
