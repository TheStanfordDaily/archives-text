## Cartwright's Grand Opera Burlesque Sketch Has Largest Cast 
### 
Tickets for the Gaities may be
purchased at the A.S.S.U. office in
the Old Union. Seats are priced
from $1 to Si.so with a large block
selling at 51.25. Roughs will be ad
mitted at the usual rate of 75 cents.
Jean Jamison, who played the
lead in ' Mardi Gras," the 1930 Jun
ior Opera, will sing two numbers in
the Ram's Head Football Gaities this
year. She has taken part in two
previous shows.
"Waiting For You," a wistfully
plaintive blues song composed by
Bob Thornton is to be one of the
numbers while Eph Engleman's song
hit, the "Rcdhaired Man" has been
chosen for her second selection.
Opera Is Hit
With a larger cast than any other
individual sketch in the show, Carl
Cartwright's burlesque of grand op
era, # '*I1 Grande Giouoco" gives
promise of being one of the high
lights of the show. Marion Hewlett,
Barbara Collins, Virginia Wilson,
Marian Jones, Bob Cathcart, Jim
Sandoe and John Shidler are the
budding Metropolitan Opera stars.
Harold Helvenston has originated
an innovation in staging for the Gai
ties. The result wil be something
very unusual in the style of pro
duction. An European note is
achieved by the use of a simple and
permanent set of levels and screens.
A white backdrop of cyclorama has
been specially designed which will
give Bob Baxter a chance to do some
excellent work in lighting effects.
Clever Songs
Jim Mohler and his band, com
posed of Harding Clegg, Fred Man
non, and Art Johnston, have some
clever numbers which may steal the
show. "She's Got Athlete's Foot,"
sung by Mohler, is only one of an
amusing group of songs.
A Marx Brothers skctch will be
put on by Sandy Lcib assisted by
Winstead Weaver and Ben Leib. To
night at 7:30 o'clock the first dress
rehearsal of the entire presentation
will be held in the Assembly Hall
with Eph Engelman acting as mas
ter of ceremonies.
Musical numbers arc being re
hearsed by Roger Sumner, one of
whose contributions is a chorus
number, "Sitting on the Steps." To
date sketches by Robert Brauns,
Robert Place, Gordon Steedman,
Don Cameron, Bob Cathcart, Tom
Pockrnan, Waldo Salt, and Carl
have been announced.

have been announced.
Tickets for the Gaities may be
purchased at the A.S.S.U. office in
the Old Union. Seats are priced
from $1 to Si.so with a large block
selling at 51.25. Roughs will be ad
mitted at the usual rate of 75 cents.
Jean Jamison, who played the
lead in ' Mardi Gras," the 1930 Jun
ior Opera, will sing two numbers in
the Ram's Head Football Gaities this
year. She has taken part in two
previous shows.
"Waiting For You," a wistfully
plaintive blues song composed by
Bob Thornton is to be one of the
numbers while Eph Engleman's song
hit, the "Rcdhaired Man" has been
chosen for her second selection.
Opera Is Hit
With a larger cast than any other
individual sketch in the show, Carl
Cartwright's burlesque of grand op
era, # '*I1 Grande Giouoco" gives
promise of being one of the high
lights of the show. Marion Hewlett,
Barbara Collins, Virginia Wilson,
Marian Jones, Bob Cathcart, Jim
Sandoe and John Shidler are the
budding Metropolitan Opera stars.
Harold Helvenston has originated
an innovation in staging for the Gai
ties. The result wil be something
very unusual in the style of pro
duction. An European note is
achieved by the use of a simple and
permanent set of levels and screens.
A white backdrop of cyclorama has
been specially designed which will
give Bob Baxter a chance to do some
excellent work in lighting effects.
Clever Songs
Jim Mohler and his band, com
posed of Harding Clegg, Fred Man
non, and Art Johnston, have some
clever numbers which may steal the
show. "She's Got Athlete's Foot,"
sung by Mohler, is only one of an
amusing group of songs.
A Marx Brothers skctch will be
put on by Sandy Lcib assisted by
Winstead Weaver and Ben Leib. To
night at 7:30 o'clock the first dress
rehearsal of the entire presentation
will be held in the Assembly Hall
with Eph Engelman acting as mas
ter of ceremonies.
Musical numbers arc being re
hearsed by Roger Sumner, one of
whose contributions is a chorus
number, "Sitting on the Steps." To
date sketches by Robert Brauns,
Robert Place, Gordon Steedman,
Don Cameron, Bob Cathcart, Tom
Pockrnan, Waldo Salt, and Carl
have been announced.
