# California Men Fail in Second Bonfire Attack
## Entire Campus Comes to Rescue of Freshman Guard Surprised by Berkeley Rush; Three Invaders Recognized as California Freshmen 100 MAN SHIFTS WORK ON FILLING OF PYRE Guards Heavily Armed Against Anticipated Return Attack; Close Watch Kept on Structure 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
JN A SURPRISE ATTACK at fi:so last night, while the Stanford frosli
were gathering in Encina Hall for a rally, about 40 California men were
almost successful in igniting the gigantic Big Game bonfire. Surprising
a small guard of only 15 men, 10 cars covered with Cal windshield
stickers drove up in a body, parked on the edge of the field, and attempted
to rush the defenders. I hey fled at once, however, as soon as the sirens
were sounded and aroused the entire campus. This was the second
unsuccessful aftempt to set off the blaze prematurely. Three of the in
vaders were recognized by the Stanford men as U.C. freshmen. The only
casualty occurred when "Pop Hanagan sprained an ankle in running

to the scene of the attempted attack.
Had those on guard duty not
given the alarm immediately it is
doubtful if the bonfire would still
be here, according to Bob Atkinson
and Marvie Kahn, in charge of the
freshmen. A regular system of a
continuous 100-man guard was at
once installed in anticipation of a
return attack.
Fill Framework
Because of the enormous amount
of work leit to be done, the ma
jority of the guards were put to
work on the finishing touches of
the Campanile and the massive
framework which is to be filled with
all the combustible debris obtain
able this morning. Under the glare
of the powerful beacons surround
ing the structure the men were en
abled to labor as effectively as dur
ing the day.
From 7 to 11 o'clock last evening
all men taking the Chemistry 10
mid-quarter examination were
drafted for duty; from 10 p.m. to
4 a.m. the basement and second
floor rooms of Encina turned out;
from 3 to 9 o'clock this morning,
the first and third floors were on
duty; from 9 a.m. until 1 o'clock
this afternoon the basement and
second floor rooms will again be on
guard; from 1 p.m. until the huge
pyr<; is set off tonight the entire
freshman class will be on the scene
of the mock Campanile sacrifice.
Close Guard on Pyre
No freshmen will be permitted to
go to the rally tonight, but will be
compelled to watch the bonfire in
the event of a last-minute attempt
on the part of the twice-repelled in
vaders to realize on their 2 to 1
wagers made on the U.C. campus
last week-end on the hope that they
would destroy the structure.
Because of the fact that after 5
o'clock today the pile will be oil
soaked, Bill Werder stated, it will
require the united efforts of all the
frosh to keep even one match from
finding its way to the wood. The
structure has already reached its
total height of slightly over 70 feet,
and could be ignited in a second,
he said.
All guards were armed with sticks
and branches in anticipation of a re
turn attack with clubs and bottles
as weapons on the part of the
Berkeleyans. Patrols constantly tra
versed ihe roads leading to the site
of the stack and a special car in
vestigated the Bay Bridge routes all
night.
The men on duty were served cof
fee, doughnuts and sandwiches dur
ing the night. A slight drizzle was
felt early in the evening, but the
wood was not seriously dampened, j
Promptly after the rally this eve- i
ning the funeral pyre will be lit at ;
various points by Bill Werder, Mar- j
vie Kahn, Bob Atkinson, Gene Mires ]
and "Pop" Flannagan, it was an- 1
nounced. Many visitors are expect
ed, and everything has been ar- '
ranged so that they will be at a safe 1
distance from the blaze.
The greatest difficulty, Werder >
said, will come during the rally, ,
when people v/ill be all around the
structure, and it will be difficult to
recognize a Stanford man from any
visiting marauder. No one will be
allowed within the barbed-wire en
closure except those known to be
on duty, it was disclosed. The ex
pected mode of attack includes the
use of a "harpoon gun" with a sul
phur bomb fired at the pyre.

both sides are losers.

this afternoon the basement and

pyr<; is set off tonight the entire
freshman class will be on the scene
of the mock Campanile sacrifice.
Close Guard on Pyre
No freshmen will be permitted to
go to the rally tonight, but will be
compelled to watch the bonfire in
the event of a last-minute attempt
on the part of the twice-repelled in
vaders to realize on their 2 to 1
wagers made on the U.C. campus
last week-end on the hope that they
would destroy the structure.
Because of the fact that after 5
o'clock today the pile will be oil
soaked, Bill Werder stated, it will
require the united efforts of all the
frosh to keep even one match from
finding its way to the wood. The
structure has already reached its
total height of slightly over 70 feet,
and could be ignited in a second,
he said.
All guards were armed with sticks
and branches in anticipation of a re
turn attack with clubs and bottles
as weapons on the part of the
Berkeleyans. Patrols constantly tra
versed ihe roads leading to the site
of the stack and a special car in
vestigated the Bay Bridge routes all
night.
The men on duty were served cof
fee, doughnuts and sandwiches dur
ing the night. A slight drizzle was
felt early in the evening, but the
wood was not seriously dampened, j
Promptly after the rally this eve- i
ning the funeral pyre will be lit at ;
various points by Bill Werder, Mar- j
vie Kahn, Bob Atkinson, Gene Mires ]
and "Pop" Flannagan, it was an- 1
nounced. Many visitors are expect
ed, and everything has been ar- '
ranged so that they will be at a safe 1
distance from the blaze.
The greatest difficulty, Werder >
said, will come during the rally, ,
when people v/ill be all around the
structure, and it will be difficult to
recognize a Stanford man from any
visiting marauder. No one will be
allowed within the barbed-wire en
closure except those known to be
on duty, it was disclosed. The ex
pected mode of attack includes the
use of a "harpoon gun" with a sul
phur bomb fired at the pyre.

War is the only game from which
both sides are losers.
JN A SURPRISE ATTACK at fi:so last night, while the Stanford frosli
were gathering in Encina Hall for a rally, about 40 California men were
almost successful in igniting the gigantic Big Game bonfire. Surprising
a small guard of only 15 men, 10 cars covered with Cal windshield
stickers drove up in a body, parked on the edge of the field, and attempted
to rush the defenders. I hey fled at once, however, as soon as the sirens
were sounded and aroused the entire campus. This was the second
unsuccessful aftempt to set off the blaze prematurely. Three of the in
vaders were recognized by the Stanford men as U.C. freshmen. The only
casualty occurred when "Pop Hanagan sprained an ankle in running

to the scene of the attempted attack.
Had those on guard duty not
given the alarm immediately it is
doubtful if the bonfire would still
be here, according to Bob Atkinson
and Marvie Kahn, in charge of the
freshmen. A regular system of a
continuous 100-man guard was at
once installed in anticipation of a
return attack.
Fill Framework
Because of the enormous amount
of work leit to be done, the ma
jority of the guards were put to
work on the finishing touches of
the Campanile and the massive
framework which is to be filled with
all the combustible debris obtain
able this morning. Under the glare
of the powerful beacons surround
ing the structure the men were en
abled to labor as effectively as dur
