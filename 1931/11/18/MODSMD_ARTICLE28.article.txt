# PLOT TO KIDNAP POP WARNER IS FLOP--FOX FLEES
## 
### 
A little joshing by some of
the California faiders Monday
morning gave rise to the sen
sational Pop Warner kidnap
ping story printed in last
night's issues of the San Fran
cisco News and the Call-Bul
letin.
The essential facts, as con
firmed by Don Liebendorfer,
director of the Stanford news
service, were these:
Hearing the siren early Mon
day morning, Pop Warner
dressed and drove toward tho
scene of the excitement. On
Embarcadero near the campus,
Warnor stopped to ask a group
of fellows what was the cause
of the rumpus.
Recognizing Warner, the
gang, which happened to be
from Cal, jokingly threatened
to kidnap the Indian coach.
Warner merely stepped on the
gas and left the scene.
No further attempts on the
person of Warner have been
1 eported.
