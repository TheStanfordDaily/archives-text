IJer career on (Ik- campus was meteoric. From the time
that she first appeared at school her success was assured
for she became instantly popular with the roughs and
members of her own sex as well.
Nor was her popularity undeserved for she was grace
ful, amusing and, though not beautiful, she was very at
tractive with her brown eyes and sensitive features. She
never spoke out of turn and in her quiet way won the love
and affection of all who met her.
Hut her downfall was as startling and sudden as her
rise to fame. Like all co-eds who do not heed the advicle
of the dean of women, she took to drink and debauchery
and her doom was sealed. Often in public she was seen
swaying about in a drunken manner and waving her arms
like a high school sophomore.
Then she disappeared. For two days all wondered
where she had gone for she had left no note nor indicated
to anyone that she was leaving.
The third day after her disappearance the mystery was
solved in a startling manner. One of the Greeks on the
How, lounging in the living room of the house next door,
happened to mention in a thoughtless moment, "God, that
duck of yours made tough eating."
So passed Josephine, greatly loved and much lamented.
