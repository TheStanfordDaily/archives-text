# "LITTLE HANDBOOKS OFT REMIND US OF THE BATTLES WON BEHIND US"
## 
### 
Our text for this week will he the student handbook of
Stanford I niversity, published by the A.S.S.I', so that "all
may understand its ideals, customs, regulations and insti-
I ul ions."
Before quoting the following excerpts, we hasten to as
sure our readers that California is a University middling
to well-known in these parts, that California has a mid
dling to a fair-sized campus with a few buildings on it,
that California has a football team that has won a fair If)
middling number of Big Games in the last forty years.
From page 106 of the Stanford text:
"II is a traditional belief that Stanford teams are better
lhan California's, that Stanford coaches are more clever,
thai Stanford women are better looking, that Stanford mem
are better dressed, that the California campus is a hetero
geneous display of ramshackle buildings, that Blue and
Cold is an extremely ill-chosen color combination, that all
Cnlifornians are typical movie collegians."
From page 163 of the text:
"Big Came night is theoretically the evening when all
Stanford migrates to San Francisco to celebrate the annual
victory over California."
From page 172:
"Poor Call is a message of sympathy and condolence
which quite often is wafted over the field to the sorrowing
California rooters. "Warning: Please refrain from being
sympathetic until you are sure that things, meaning the
game, are going to turn out satisfactorily—for Stanford."
The author of the text seems to grow a little less sure
of himself with the passing pages. Perhaps, up in the two
hundreds somewhere, the good book might shiver a little
and remember that the sons of Stanford have not always
been on the long end of the score. It might have said some
thing like this, if we had chosen to exhaust the whole text
this morning:
"California won every Big Came from 1910 to 1023 in
clusive, and on the next year thereafter the score read
20 to 20. But let us not think of those dreadful times
brothers. Rather let us begin with the year 1025 and recall
that Stanford has won five of the last six games."
As for the allusion to Berkeley's ramshackle buildings,
may we remind the A.S.S.C. that the earthquake of 1006
practically wrecked the Stanford campus, and that we are
still using North hall and several contemporaries dating
back to pre-earthquake days. A few of our buildings may
be old, but they don't shv at earthquakes.*
By way of closing today's review, we assure Stanford
that the year 1031 mav bring about results that severely
upset the editorial policy of the Stanford Handbook. After
all, even handbooks must have policies.
* Fxcerpt from the latest issue of the Seismological Ga
zette.
"f'ecenl computations indicate that another severe
earthquake is due Saturday, November 21, in the general
vicinity of Palo Alto. Inhabitants of the peninsular city are
warned to prepare for what promises to be a major up
heaval." Daili ] Californian.

clusive, and on the next year thereafter the score read
20 to 20. But let us not think of those dreadful times
brothers. Rather let us begin with the year 1025 and recall
that Stanford has won five of the last six games."
As for the allusion to Berkeley's ramshackle buildings,
may we remind the A.S.S.C. that the earthquake of 1006
practically wrecked the Stanford campus, and that we are
still using North hall and several contemporaries dating
back to pre-earthquake days. A few of our buildings may
be old, but they don't shv at earthquakes.*
By way of closing today's review, we assure Stanford
that the year 1031 mav bring about results that severely
upset the editorial policy of the Stanford Handbook. After
all, even handbooks must have policies.

"f'ecenl computations indicate that another severe
earthquake is due Saturday, November 21, in the general
vicinity of Palo Alto. Inhabitants of the peninsular city are
warned to prepare for what promises to be a major up
heaval." Daili ] Californian.
Our text for this week will he the student handbook of
Stanford I niversity, published by the A.S.S.I', so that "all
may understand its ideals, customs, regulations and insti-
I ul ions."
Before quoting the following excerpts, we hasten to as
sure our readers that California is a University middling
to well-known in these parts, that California has a mid
dling to a fair-sized campus with a few buildings on it,
that California has a football team that has won a fair If)
middling number of Big Games in the last forty years.
From page 106 of the Stanford text:
"II is a traditional belief that Stanford teams are better
lhan California's, that Stanford coaches are more clever,
thai Stanford women are better looking, that Stanford mem
are better dressed, that the California campus is a hetero
geneous display of ramshackle buildings, that Blue and
Cold is an extremely ill-chosen color combination, that all
Cnlifornians are typical movie collegians."
From page 163 of the text:
"Big Came night is theoretically the evening when all
Stanford migrates to San Francisco to celebrate the annual
victory over California."
From page 172:
"Poor Call is a message of sympathy and condolence
which quite often is wafted over the field to the sorrowing
California rooters. "Warning: Please refrain from being
sympathetic until you are sure that things, meaning the
game, are going to turn out satisfactorily—for Stanford."
The author of the text seems to grow a little less sure
of himself with the passing pages. Perhaps, up in the two
hundreds somewhere, the good book might shiver a little
and remember that the sons of Stanford have not always
been on the long end of the score. It might have said some
thing like this, if we had chosen to exhaust the whole text
this morning:
"California won every Big Came from 1910 to 1023 in
clusive, and on the next year thereafter the score read
20 to 20. But let us not think of those dreadful times
brothers. Rather let us begin with the year 1025 and recall
that Stanford has won five of the last six games."
