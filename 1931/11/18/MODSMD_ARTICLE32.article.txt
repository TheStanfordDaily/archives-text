# BULL SESSION
## TOO MANY PILLARS 
### 
Folk-lore is continually in the t
making. Day by day—imperceptibly
—certain traditions grow up among
the people which never Cbuld stand
to be bared to the light of day. Cer- !
tain ideals are held for no better
reason than "they are held." One
of the most general and at the same j
time one of the most pernicious of
these common myths is that it is :
highly desirable for the individual j
to have a well-balanced character :
and personality—the individual
without any extremes is held the
individual worthwhile.
Now the idea seems good because
we all know it; but is it genuinely
sound? Obviously, it is the people
who are one-sided that reach the I
peak; the individuals who are rela
tively one-sided manage to get huge
holdings on the slopes, at least;
while the masses who are well bal- I
anced in all their interests never
get beyond the foothills. If Napo- i
leon had not had one certain over
powering drive, he probably would
have ended as he began, a lieuten- ;
ant in the French artillery. If
Rockefeller hadn't been a hopeless
ly one-sided man he would still be :
on his clerk's chair. When Anthony >
had but one motive in life, it looked i
as if lu* was well on his way to do 1
great things, but the moment he [
divided his attentions between offi- j
cial business at Rome and the not- i
so-official business in Egypt, his !
doom was sealed.
Of course, if one is content with j
middling success and most of us !
are, the surest and safest means is |
by being very balanced in one's 1

! interests. The so-called pillars of
| society in every community ax - e the
individuals who have adopted this
way of living. But are pillars good
! things? Is it enjoyable to be a pillar
of society? Pillars of society are
j afraid to laugh uproariously at the
! most nonsensical factors in our liv
; ing for fear that they will crack
! into bits, and the whole mass of
| antiquated customs that pillars uo
-1 hold will come tumbling down upon
them in one nasty heap.
The pillars of society are those
J successful citizens that are afraid
j to display "Hoover" stickers if they
live in South Carolina or "Smith"
, stickers if they happened to live
in Palo Alto. The children of ail
pillars must have church weddings
even though they would rather be
married by the city clerk in Yuma
or Reno. The pillars are afraid to
have radical literature sent to them
i in order to get an amusing glimpse
at what other people are thinking
j for l'ear of what the postman may
i think. The pillars sleep, dress, eat,
1 think, walk, and drive in ways be
; fitting their station. It is a terrible
i existence.
To realize that the happiest per-
I son is the one-sided person, let us
1 consider the case of the cow and
J the bull. The cow sits in one spot
j chewing its cud with all of its in
i terests very well balanced. The cow
i is a colorless, insipid form of life,
j But take the bull—he is erratic, he
j runs at red in a violent, over-bal
anced fashion. He really lives. He
j adds color to life; and enjoys living.
