FIVE STAR FINAL—At the Stan
ford. Also Pop Warner in a short.
When cash customers applaud a
talkie^—now that's news. And that's
also a darned good talkie. People
very energetically struck their
palms together in praise of "Five
Star Final"—it's that good.
Like "The Front Page," it reaches
the high-water mark when it comes
to good old melodrama, human in
terest, strong language, comedy, and
suspense. Like its predecessor in
the realm of newspaper movies it
was also founded on actual fact—
the reviewer personally will testify
to that.
As that tabloid city editor with a
troubled conscience and the habit
of washing his hands a dozen times
a day, Edward G. Robinson of
"Little Caesar" fame is perfectly
cast. So are most of the other char
acters —that's what makes this talkie
so good. Oscar Apfel, in particular,
as the tabloid owner who, "for its
moral value," ■ allows a story, after
a lapse of 20 years, to be hauled out
from the "morgue" to, boost his cir
culation, thus causing two suicides,
one broken engagement, and plenty
of excitement all around, is excel
lent.
Pop Warner is here again in a
short, "Developing a Football
Team." Pop should know something
about that—if anybody. —W. R.

***A CONVERSATION WITH A CAT.

AND OTHERS—By Hilairc !?«•;-
loc. Harper & Brothers. 1931. (At
the Stanford Bookstore.)
The conversation with the cat is j
five pages long. It is a whimsy made ]
up of philosophical remarks like j
this, "for in words lie the seeds of ;
all dissension." It is quaint but Bel
loc appears to be striving for effect.
We object only to the appearance
of the striving; his effect is, as i
usual, definite and pleasing. Almost ]
all the essays in the collection I

echo this fault. "On Having One's
Portrait Painted" and "A Guide to
Boring" are notable exceptions.
Belloc's tendency to overdo him
self is also seen in the lengths of
the essays. Most of them are six
pages long, two are seven, and the
iest are five. Such an arrangement
must certainly be forced. How la
mentable it is when an able writer
can't get away from playing with
mechanical form.
"A Guide to Boring," good and
funny, is typical of these amusing
observations on familiar subjects.
The rules given are hesitation over
a date, trying to remember a name
that you have forgotten, the use of
too many adjectives, etc. The essays
are rather trite but are refreshing
at least.
—of course Belloc is always worth
reading. —E.T.P.

***A CONVERSATION WITH A CAT.

AND OTHERS—By Hilairc !?«•;-
loc. Harper & Brothers. 1931. (At
the Stanford Bookstore.)
The conversation with the cat is j
five pages long. It is a whimsy made ]
up of philosophical remarks like j
this, "for in words lie the seeds of ;
all dissension." It is quaint but Bel
loc appears to be striving for effect.
We object only to the appearance
of the striving; his effect is, as i
usual, definite and pleasing. Almost ]
all the essays in the collection I

echo this fault. "On Having One's
Portrait Painted" and "A Guide to
Boring" are notable exceptions.
Belloc's tendency to overdo him
self is also seen in the lengths of
the essays. Most of them are six
pages long, two are seven, and the
iest are five. Such an arrangement
must certainly be forced. How la
mentable it is when an able writer
can't get away from playing with
mechanical form.
"A Guide to Boring," good and
funny, is typical of these amusing
observations on familiar subjects.
The rules given are hesitation over
a date, trying to remember a name
that you have forgotten, the use of
too many adjectives, etc. The essays
are rather trite but are refreshing
at least.
—of course Belloc is always worth
reading. —E.T.P.
FIVE STAR FINAL—At the Stan
ford. Also Pop Warner in a short.
When cash customers applaud a
talkie^—now that's news. And that's
also a darned good talkie. People
very energetically struck their
palms together in praise of "Five
Star Final"—it's that good.
Like "The Front Page," it reaches
the high-water mark when it comes
to good old melodrama, human in
terest, strong language, comedy, and
suspense. Like its predecessor in
the realm of newspaper movies it
was also founded on actual fact—
the reviewer personally will testify
to that.
As that tabloid city editor with a
troubled conscience and the habit
of washing his hands a dozen times
a day, Edward G. Robinson of
"Little Caesar" fame is perfectly
cast. So are most of the other char
acters —that's what makes this talkie
so good. Oscar Apfel, in particular,
as the tabloid owner who, "for its
moral value," ■ allows a story, after
a lapse of 20 years, to be hauled out
from the "morgue" to, boost his cir
culation, thus causing two suicides,
one broken engagement, and plenty
of excitement all around, is excel
lent.
Pop Warner is here again in a
short, "Developing a Football
Team." Pop should know something
