## HE TAKES ISSUE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In a ridiculous way the Daily
continues to baffle its readers on
the question of cigarette smoking
by Ihe 500 women enrolled hei*e.
Since the opening of the fall quar
ter, live editorials have appeared in
the paper which categorically deny
existence of the smoking question
while simultaneously dragging this
very issue before the light of cam
pus attention. One day an editorial
assures us that the problem per
ished by itself some time ago; the
next morning the rotted carcass is
exhumed again and displayed in a
loathsome manner before our sensi
tive eyes.
This inconsistent quibbling about
co-ed smoking certainly consumes
much of what you probably con
sider as valuable space in your edi
torial column. Nevertheless, in that
very section, of the paper you claim
"smoking by women is only a prob
lem when it is made a problem."
Why does the Daily make a big
issue out of something it refuses
paradoxically to recognize as such?
If Stanford women suffer no unjust
smoking bans (except the Medieval
statute against females puffing fags
in the rooting section at football
games) and the Daily insists that
no fuss be made about the idea,
why, then, do your editorials dis
cuss so freely the smoking situa
tion, especially in some relatively
obscure colleges besides Stanford?
If these questions are too annoy
ing, please answer this one for the
benefit of your readers: As the
Daily feels smoking is not an issue
worth any attention, when will the
issue be dropped permanently from
your editorial column?
