And the Big Bear said to the
little fair-haired country lass:
"Yea, verily, thou shall not
paint our Big C\ nor yet smear
red paint on our family portrait
models." But little Ruddylocks
was not afraid of said hear, and
went right ahead and set the
Campanile on lire.

All this in ease Cal has not, be
i fore eight o'clock this evening, man
aged to smuggle in a few chemical-
I painted boards, just to make it
phos-phor-ous. (Get it, Oscar my
■ boy?) They're a strategic bunch,
; without a doubt, and we're only
j hoping to out-smart them till we
i can all gather 'round and be roasted
| in tune to "Come Join the Band."
j Three cheers for every frosh who's
i contributed his share of toothpicks
I to the cause.

Incidentally, there's going to
be more fun gotten from the ad
vent of 80/.o the Bear to the
rally's midst than anything eise
on record. A couple of us bribed
Friend Boyles to let us have a
peek at Bozo out at the Family
Farm last night, and he's
avowedly a model pet for any
campus. Don't forget the lump
sugar—they all love it.

Our Mills Collitch pals across the j
bay gave a very splendiferous brawl j
in the city, last week, which, if we j
may make bolcl to comment, ac- j
counted largely for the absence of i
many of our social he-lights from ;
the Cotillion. And the funniest
thing, girls—the programs were j
done in red and white, and some- j
one asked why they'd chosen those !
particular colors. But "Oh!" the |
damsel cried in snswer, "don't you
think they're pretty together?"

Little Willie, aged 19%, says:
"A widow is a wife without a
husband."

Speaking of form-fitting, tailor- j
made clothes, somebody's even gone
to the trouble of inventing a form- j
fitting package of cigarettes. All of j
which is very fine, if the gum i
manufacturers will keep up with \
the times and invent a stick of gum
that is guaranteed not to cause a
bulge in the cheek of a fashion
loving chewer.

The Big Pink Machinc came |

into the limelight again this
week-end when a double quar
tet from the Glee Club per
formed for a South San Fran
cisco multitude. Their biggest
hit of the evening, so-planned,
was announced on the program
as "A Dance Novelty." And
everybody cheered. Fine stuff!

formed for a South San Fran
cisco multitude. Their biggest
hit of the evening, so-planned,
was announced on the program
as "A Dance Novelty." And
everybody cheered. Fine stuff!
And the Big Bear said to the
little fair-haired country lass:
"Yea, verily, thou shall not
paint our Big C\ nor yet smear
red paint on our family portrait
models." But little Ruddylocks
was not afraid of said hear, and
went right ahead and set the
Campanile on lire.

All this in ease Cal has not, be
i fore eight o'clock this evening, man
aged to smuggle in a few chemical-
I painted boards, just to make it
phos-phor-ous. (Get it, Oscar my
■ boy?) They're a strategic bunch,
; without a doubt, and we're only
j hoping to out-smart them till we
i can all gather 'round and be roasted
| in tune to "Come Join the Band."
j Three cheers for every frosh who's
i contributed his share of toothpicks
I to the cause.

Incidentally, there's going to
be more fun gotten from the ad
vent of 80/.o the Bear to the
rally's midst than anything eise
on record. A couple of us bribed
Friend Boyles to let us have a
peek at Bozo out at the Family
Farm last night, and he's
avowedly a model pet for any
campus. Don't forget the lump
sugar—they all love it.

Our Mills Collitch pals across the j
bay gave a very splendiferous brawl j
in the city, last week, which, if we j
may make bolcl to comment, ac- j
counted largely for the absence of i
many of our social he-lights from ;
the Cotillion. And the funniest
thing, girls—the programs were j
done in red and white, and some- j
one asked why they'd chosen those !
particular colors. But "Oh!" the |
damsel cried in snswer, "don't you
think they're pretty together?"

Little Willie, aged 19%, says:
"A widow is a wife without a
husband."

Speaking of form-fitting, tailor- j
made clothes, somebody's even gone
to the trouble of inventing a form- j
fitting package of cigarettes. All of j
which is very fine, if the gum i
manufacturers will keep up with \
the times and invent a stick of gum
that is guaranteed not to cause a
bulge in the cheek of a fashion
loving chewer.
