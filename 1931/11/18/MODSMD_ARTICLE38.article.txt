# MAGAZINES, BOOKS NEEDED BY CHURCH FOR SEAMEN'S FUND
## 
### 
The Seamen's Institute of San
Francisco, under the patronage of
the Episcopal Church, is in constant
want of books and magazines with
which to carry on its work of sup
plying reading material to the sea
men of ships sailing from San Fran
cisco ports.
Donors are asked to notify Mrs.
W. D. Briggs of Palo Alto between
the hours of 5 and 7 during the
present week in order that she may
make arrangements for collecting
such material as they may wish to
give. All sorts of books, including
textbooks, are acceptable.

Reports from Philadelphia indicate
that Connie Mack may resign the
managership he has held so long be
cause of his age.
