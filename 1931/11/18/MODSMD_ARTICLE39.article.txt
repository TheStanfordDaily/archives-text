LOOK OUT for those Bill Ingram
Bears Saturday—they're a danger
cms breed.
Memory goes back to 192-4, when
Pop Warner led his first invasion of
Berkeley and snatched a 20 to 20
tie away from the late Andy Smith,
when the Smith Bears apparently
had the game in the bag. Details
of that historic combat, with its
last-minute touchdown on a long
pass and the subsequent vital con
version, hardly need be repeated.
And memory goes back to 1927,
when Howard Jones' Trojans were
forced to yield a 13 to 13 tie in'the
( losing minutes of play. That time
il was a big, green sophomore, Ilerb
Fleishhacker, who battered the ball
down the field almost to the goal
line, and then tossed a wobbly little
pass into the end zone lor the
touchdown.
The following year the Nibs Price
Bears found themselves winning the
first Big Game for California .since
1923. The half had ended 13 to 0
in favor of the Berkeley eleven, and
the Indians (nee Cards) had been
held to one touchdown in the sec
ond. A minute and a half to play,
fourth down, 22 yards out —but an
other pass robbed Price of his vic
tory and he had to be content with
a 13 to 13 tie.
"BUT WHAT the heck," you
want to know, "has that got to
do with Ingrain? Doesn't that
simply show that Pop is never
beaten until the final gun, and
that Navy Bill had better do
some looking out of his own
Saturday?"
PERHAPS SO. but let's dig up a
little more history
Take the season of 1926, for in
stance, when Ingram was in his
first season at Annapolis. The Naval
Academy was still on speaking
terms with the Army, and Ingram's
Midshipmen entered their big game
with the Cadets with an unblem
ished record behind them.
Near the end of a bitterly fought
contest, the powerful Army eleven
was leading, 21 to 14. THAT game
was in the bog. Then Navy launched
a final drive that carried them over
the goal, converted for the third
time, and duplicated' the finish of
our 1924 Big Game.
"My teams always play their
best in their big games," said
Sailor Bill when he came to the
coast. The records prove that.
And so we repeal. LOOK OUT
for those Bill Ingram Bears
Saturday. —L.M.C.

The following year the Nibs Price
Bears found themselves winning the
first Big Game for California .since
1923. The half had ended 13 to 0
in favor of the Berkeley eleven, and
the Indians (nee Cards) had been
held to one touchdown in the sec
ond. A minute and a half to play,
fourth down, 22 yards out —but an
other pass robbed Price of his vic
tory and he had to be content with
a 13 to 13 tie.
"BUT WHAT the heck," you
want to know, "has that got to
do with Ingrain? Doesn't that
simply show that Pop is never
beaten until the final gun, and
that Navy Bill had better do
some looking out of his own
Saturday?"
PERHAPS SO. but let's dig up a
little more history
Take the season of 1926, for in
stance, when Ingram was in his
first season at Annapolis. The Naval
Academy was still on speaking
terms with the Army, and Ingram's
Midshipmen entered their big game
with the Cadets with an unblem
ished record behind them.
Near the end of a bitterly fought
contest, the powerful Army eleven
was leading, 21 to 14. THAT game
was in the bog. Then Navy launched
a final drive that carried them over
the goal, converted for the third
time, and duplicated' the finish of
our 1924 Big Game.
"My teams always play their
best in their big games," said
Sailor Bill when he came to the
coast. The records prove that.
And so we repeal. LOOK OUT
for those Bill Ingram Bears
Saturday. —L.M.C.
LOOK OUT for those Bill Ingram
Bears Saturday—they're a danger
cms breed.
Memory goes back to 192-4, when
Pop Warner led his first invasion of
Berkeley and snatched a 20 to 20
tie away from the late Andy Smith,
when the Smith Bears apparently
had the game in the bag. Details
of that historic combat, with its
last-minute touchdown on a long
pass and the subsequent vital con
version, hardly need be repeated.
And memory goes back to 1927,
when Howard Jones' Trojans were
forced to yield a 13 to 13 tie in'the
( losing minutes of play. That time
il was a big, green sophomore, Ilerb
Fleishhacker, who battered the ball
down the field almost to the goal
line, and then tossed a wobbly little
pass into the end zone lor the
touchdown.
