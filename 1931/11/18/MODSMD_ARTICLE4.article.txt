## Antics Of Doll-Like Actors Amuse Spectators

Complete competence character
ized the performance of Perry Dil
, ley's puppets last night in the As
• sembly Hall.
j Grace Wickham and Grace Stearn
i pulled the strings with a finesse that
made "The Emperor's New Clothes"
i and "The Three Wishes" appear
j more like dreams than merely the
' machinations of wooden actors. The
: production was free from the limi
tations of realism that hamper ordi-
I nary drama and free from the stand
ardized humor of stage comedies.
Skill in Handling
| The puppets were guided through
their lines with a dexterity and
! nimbleness that made one wonder
I if the puppets were not really tiny
I human beings who had come to life
! especially for this production. From
| the beginning to the end, the appre
ciative audience was convulsed with
1 laughter at the antics of the doll
j like figures and the situations in
which they found themselves.
"The Emperor's New Clothes" was
a modern satire adapted by Perry
! Dilley from the Hans Christian An
! derson fairy tale. He put into the
i story a number of new characters —
!or caricatures —taken from every
day life about us. There was the
Lady Who Believes in Art, for in
! stance. She reads all the latest
j books (or the reviews of them, at
1 least) and feels compelled to quote
them at everybody on the least pro
j vocation, and all in a single breath.
Bored Monarch
The Emperor, the central charac
ter, is a very bored monarch. Noth
i ing pleases him, nothing tempts him,
, nothing amuses him. Only one thing
remained that interested him: his
! clothes. When the Emperor has
J worn every cloak conceivable by
I his valets, two strangers offer to
, make for him a new suit which shall
j be so wonderful that only people of
j high and noble character can. see it.
j The Emperor tries it on and pa
( rades before his people. A little
i child in the crowd, with one short
remark, pricks the bubble of con
ceit and vanity.
