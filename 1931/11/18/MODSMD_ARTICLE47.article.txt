# CARDS DEFINITELY ASSURED PENNANT IN SOCCER LEAGUE
## Will Meet Bears Saturday, But Have a Winning Percentage Now 
### 
With (he San Francisco Univer-
I sity Hilltoppers safely out of the
league race due to their defeat at
the hands of the Berkeley' Bears
; yesterday, 2-2, the Stanford varsity
! kickers last night prepared for the
! third California soccer game Sat
urday.
As far as percentages go, Stan
ford has won the conference al
ready. S.F.U. has tied with Stan
ford, California, and San Mateo, as
well as the defeat at the hands of
the Bears.
Stanford's record to date is marred
only by the tie with the Hilltoppers,
whom they meet in the last game
of the season, sometime in Decem
ber.
With four regulars still taking the
rest cure, after last Saturday's mud
] fight with California, Coach Eber
| hart gave the second- and third
| string varsities a hard workout,
| searching for combinations good
I enough to bring home the year's
j third bearskin.
As the lineup looks now, Doding
â–  ton will probably get into the game
| in place of Mearns at outside right;
Meiggs may replace Captain Falk
lat right inside; Spoehr will take
j Hayes' position at right-half; and
! Williams should get in a half at
1 goalie, for Webster.

There are 8760 hours in a year of
365 days and 84,600 seconds in a
day of 24 hours.
