# AL RAY THROWS JAVELIN 192 FEET IN FRIDAY MEET
## 
### Dick Strouse 
Over in an obscure comer of the
muddy "turf" inside the Old Oval,
an event occurred last Friday that
may have an important hearing on
the outcome of this year's 1.C.4-A.
and Stanford-U.S. C. track meets.
Al Ray, Templeton's premier javelin
thrower, ran forward a few steps
with a stick in his right hand,
paused, and then threw that stick
to a spot some 192 feet from his
stopping-place.
Ray's effort is a foot better than
his best mark of last season, made
when he took a fourth m the
1.C.4-A.'s, and would be sensational
for any spear-tosser in a pre-season
meet. It is particularly encouraging
to Stanford track fans because all
three men that beat Alin last year's
nationals have graduated, thus
leaving Ray, and Mackenzie and
Williamson of U.S.C. the outstand
ing javelin-throwers in the country.
Threatens U.S.C.
MacKenzie won the javelin in
the 1931 Stanford-U.S.C. meet, and
| Williamson was hovering around
i 200 feet while still a frosh. How-
S ever, if Ray improves as much as
| present evidence seems to indicate
jis probable, Messrs. MacKenzie,
; Williamson, and Cromwell may find
j that a Stanford Indian can beat a
j Trojan in the latter's own game of
I javelin-throwing.
[ Templeton will have Rintala,
i Kantzer, Dunn, Ullman, and Brown
; from whom to choose his other
j spear-tossers. Rintala, due to his
, football and basketball activities,
! will not be out \intil the spring
quarter. If at that time Rudy decides
| to concentrate on track instead of
{ baseball, he may considerably im
] prove his last year's mark of 180
; feet. The other four men have all
j thrown the elongated arrow some
< 165 feet more or less.

i Ray's development as a javelin -
| thrower is interesting, as he never
| hud participated in this event until
; last year. In spite of a shoulder in
jury that kept him out of the P.A.A.,
i Fresno, and Big Meets, Ray was,
as stated before, good enough to
i place in the nationals last season.
. A1 came to Stanford as a basketball
I player, and although he won his
i numerals in that sport, it appears
that he will be more valuable to the
track team than he possibly could
i be to John Bunn.
Other track news is mainly con
i cerned with the many injured per
| formers. Captain-on-leave Ike Ha
! bles was out last night to limber
1 up, and Frank Lombardi again tried
j out his weak leg, which he is still
inclined to favor. Paul Aebersold
J has competed in no recent meets
I due to sinus trouble, Don Blackmail
| has been resting his legs, Bob At
! kinson has been working on the
] Big Game bonfire, and Bill Wer-
I der's shoulder is still sore. Azevedo
| and Burch, who did not run Friday
j due to pesky colds, appear to have
I lecovered their health and vigor.

Over in an obscure comer of the
muddy "turf" inside the Old Oval,
an event occurred last Friday that
may have an important hearing on
the outcome of this year's 1.C.4-A.
and Stanford-U.S. C. track meets.
Al Ray, Templeton's premier javelin
thrower, ran forward a few steps
with a stick in his right hand,
paused, and then threw that stick
to a spot some 192 feet from his
stopping-place.
Ray's effort is a foot better than
his best mark of last season, made
when he took a fourth m the
1.C.4-A.'s, and would be sensational
for any spear-tosser in a pre-season
meet. It is particularly encouraging
to Stanford track fans because all
three men that beat Alin last year's
nationals have graduated, thus
leaving Ray, and Mackenzie and
Williamson of U.S.C. the outstand
ing javelin-throwers in the country.
Threatens U.S.C.
MacKenzie won the javelin in
the 1931 Stanford-U.S.C. meet, and
| Williamson was hovering around
i 200 feet while still a frosh. How-
S ever, if Ray improves as much as
| present evidence seems to indicate
jis probable, Messrs. MacKenzie,
; Williamson, and Cromwell may find
j that a Stanford Indian can beat a
j Trojan in the latter's own game of
I javelin-throwing.
[ Templeton will have Rintala,
i Kantzer, Dunn, Ullman, and Brown
; from whom to choose his other
j spear-tossers. Rintala, due to his
, football and basketball activities,
! will not be out \intil the spring
quarter. If at that time Rudy decides
| to concentrate on track instead of
{ baseball, he may considerably im
] prove his last year's mark of 180
; feet. The other four men have all
j thrown the elongated arrow some
< 165 feet more or less.
