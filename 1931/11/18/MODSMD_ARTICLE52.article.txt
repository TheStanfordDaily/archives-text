# OLD WARNER FILM SHOWN AT HOOVER FOOTBALL REUNION
## President Calls For Time Out So Stanford Players May Recall Past 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. (/P>â€”
When President Hoover invited the
members of Stanford's 94 football
team to a reunion at the White
House, it was no "humanizing'
stunt, but a sincere invitation to
valued friends to join "Bert" Hoover
in a respite from pressing duties
for old times' sake.
Really it was "time out" for the
President, and in the few moments
of relaxation available it was char
acteristic of the President that he
should call on his Stanford friends.
Loyal to Old Friends
For Stanford holds a large place
in the lives of both the President
and Mrs. Hoover. It was there that
they met and from there a great
career started, and the friendships
that were made there have con
tinued.
Warner Film Shown
One of the carefully guarded
secrets of the reunion was that
"Pop" Warner's film, "Football 'of
Forty Years Ago," and a special
series of lantern slides made from
pictures of the old annuals under
the President's direction were
shown as a surprise to his guests.
Not only did they talk over old
times, but they saw plays of "foot
ball as was football," when a man
was left in the game unless he was
completely "out," uniforms, and the
hirsute adornments of the gay
nineties, old campus scenes, old
friends as they were when the oys
ter world was vet to be opened.
