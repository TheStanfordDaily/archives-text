Two Skits Named
Two sketches by Robert Brauns

funny. Those who will take part in
this act are: George Shibley, Vir
ginia Wilson, James Sandoe, Henry
Brill, Hugo Druehl, Elizabeth Jen
' kins, Robert Place, and Winstead
| Weaver.
"Sock-It" is a new chorus num
ber that was rehearsed last night
under the direction of Terry Brick
' I Icy, dance director of the Gaieties.
Another chorus number, "Sitting on
the Steps," was announced yester
day. The chorus itself is one of the
i snappiest that has ever been seen
on the campus stage, is Brickley's
■ opinion.
' The number that will probably
mark a high point on the evening's
! program is "The Tattooed Lady," a
• song that is composed and will be
1 presented by Bob Cathcart. Cath
j cart is also directing "II Grande
Giouoco," a burlesque of grand
j opera, and "Barbar Shop," a humor-
