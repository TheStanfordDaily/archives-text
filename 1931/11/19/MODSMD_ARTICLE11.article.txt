### 
SHREVEPORT, La., Nov. 18. (/P)
i â€”Huey P. Long today won the first
| legal skirmish in his battle to re
tain the governorship against the
1 challenge of Dr. Paul N. Cyr, his
j elected Lieutenant-Governor.
The Caddo District Court ordered
; dismissal of Dr. Cyr's ouster suit,
j which was directed against Long on
| the contention that Long automati
! cally vacated the Governor's chair
j when he certified his election to
j the United Stales Senate last spring.
Cyr alleged that Long was al
j ready exercising prerogatives as
senator and that the stale constitu
j (ion prohibits a member of Con
! gress from holding a state office but
I Judge T. F. Bell upheld Long's mo
j tion to dismiss on grounds of "no
cause of action," based upon the
; plea that Long had not yet taken
! his seat in the Senate.
