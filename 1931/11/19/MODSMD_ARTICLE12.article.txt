# GAMBLING GAME BACKED BY PET WORDS OF PROFS
## 
### 
EVANSTON, 111., Nov. JB.
(/P) â€”Pot words of the profes
sors at Northwestern Univer
sity have started a new gam
bling game. The professor who
works the phrase "by and
large" overtime, the one who
frequently says '"various and
sundry," the cne who repeats
and repeats "on the other
hand" all co-operate in spite
of themselves with the student
gamblers.
Pools are formed in each
course, the price of a ticket is
a dime, and the student who
guesses the correct number of
times a certain phrase is re
peated during one lecture wins
the pot.
