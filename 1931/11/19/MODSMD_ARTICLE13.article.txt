# SMOOT FAVORS TAX INCREASES
## Advocates Raise In Income And Excise Levies 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. (/P) —
The administration's tax program
was reflected today in a declaration
by Chairman Smoot of the Senate
Finance Committee for increased
rates on incomes and new excise
levies.
Smoot, usually an administration's
spokesman on revenue legislation,
proposed raises in all the income
brackets to a maximum of 40 per
cent on incomes over $100,000. •
He advocated also a broad system
of sales or excise taxes applying on
so-called luxury commodities. He
mentioned automobiles and radios
among the articles to be included.
The Smoot program differs some
what from that of the Republican
Independents and Democrats, who
would concentrate on the big in
comes and inheritances for the bulk,
if not all, of the new revenue.
With Congress almost evenly di
vided, a compromise seems inevit
able. This probably will include in
creased estate tax rates and few, if
any, new excise levies.
Smoot estimated 5i,200,000,000
must be raised by new taxation next
year. This is the highest figure
mentioned so far. Other congres
sional leaders believe Secretary
Mellon will be willing to resort
again to borrowing to cover part of
the deficit of more than a billion
dollars expected this year.
• Secretary Mellon led the fight for
reduction of the surtax rates which
mounted to a maximum of more
than 60 per cent during the war.
He always has opposed the Federal
estate or inheritance levy. For this
reason it is not expected he will
recommend raises in this direction.
But enough Republican regulars,
Democrats and Republican inde
pendents have declared for a boost
in the' inheritance tax to assure its
enactment.
