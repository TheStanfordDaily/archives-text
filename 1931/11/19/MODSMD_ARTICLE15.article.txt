# Row Mascots Decrease As Depression Continues
## 
### PATRICIA RICCIARDI 
I Lav/ and order should prevail-1
i along the Row with five police dogs J
holding sway a.s mascots in four
I of the fraternity houses, Kappa
! Alpha claiming two of the canine
I "preservers of the peace."
Dogs are favored as mascots in >
i the cainpus fraternity and sorority
j houses: police 'dogs, collies, aire
dales, terriers, and Russian wolf
, hounds. However, cats, white mice, j
j rabbits, and ducks are represented
j in the motley array.
The depression seems to be i'elt |
j in the "mascot market" as every- !
I where else. Eight houses which
' formerly cherished pets are now
without animals of any variety.
i Among the dear departed are:
! the beloved of the Pi Phi's, "Soko
loff," a white Russian wolfhound:
[ "General," a kitten which graced
' the A.T.O. house until an irate cook
j murdered the beast, according to
1 reports; and the big, black police
j dog of the Phi Sigs which was
| killed by an automobile two years
ago.
Other animals have been banished
I for various reasons or have not |
j found the houses to their liking and
j have departed of their own free
j will.
Mabel Walker Willebrandt only j

! took two Weeks to decide that the
JChi O's did not suit her feline
: cial nature. The two white mice of
Ihe Kappa house are believed to
have been confiscated by someone
who di ! not find their proximity to
i her liking. "Sozonov," not the Rus
sian foreign minister during the
World War, but his namesake, the
former Alpha Phi mascot, was sent
i to live on a ranch at Walnut Creek,
for residing in a sorority house was
j not at all in accord with his mas
j culine nature.
! Those who have survived the
lapid falling-off in mascots are: the
recently imported police pup of the
1 Theta Xi's; "Sig," a collie, at the
Alpha Sig house; "Pal," an airedale
of the Chi Psi's, the dean of them
all, who has lived there since 1923;
and "Tel," a big, black police dog
belonging to the Delta Chi's.
Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Alpha
seem to be attempting to make up
for (he houses which have no mas
cots. The former claims one police
dog and two Irish terriers, Jerry
and Brutus and Caesar. The two
I police puppies and the deceased
duck of the Kappa Alpha's were
named in honor of certain fortunate
j members of the "500": Georgia, Pa
jtricia, and Josephine.
