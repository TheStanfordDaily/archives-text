# "POP" SELECTS STARTERS FOR BEAR CLASSIC
## Changes In Lineup Hint At Early Running Attack By Red Machine 
### Lowell Cox 
Rintala at fullback.
i Hardy at left half.
Hulen at left guard.
These were the highlights of the j
I official starting lineup for the Big
I Game Saturday, announced last J
! night by Pop Warner.
Rudy Rintala, handy man of the
Cardinal squad who played last
year at left half, switched to right (
half this season and was finally
j shunted to fullback when Caddel
1 moved back to right wingback, re
places Dusty Allen.
Allen Is Mainstay
Allen has been the mainstay of
the Indian passing attack this sea
j son, and while Rintala is quite a
i passer himself, Warner's announce
; ment came as a great surprise. It
| may indicate that the Old Man is

I planning a running attack for the |
! early part of the game.
It was expected that Pop would
name Hardy at left half, although
j there was a possibility that either :
Moffatt or Afflerbaugh would draw ;
the assignment. It is not definitely
settled yet if Moffatt will be able to ; 1
play, but if he is, he will go in for
| Hardy, with Afflerbaugh in resei've.
Hulen edges out Bigelow at left
i guard, regaining a position he re- i
i garded as his own at the first of
1 the season. Bigelow developed fast ,
I and drew the starting assignment in !
the U.S.C. game, but Hulen, who re- !
I placed him, made a better showing 1
j in that contest.
Positions Filled
Three other positions, regarded |
! as slightly doubtful, were filled as '
expected—Colvin at left end rather ;
than Neill, Marks at center instead
1 of Milligan, and Doub at right end
| over Norgard, Reynolds, and Clark. |
Two signal-callers are included ;
in the lineup, Hardy and Hulen. It :
j is likely that Hardy, or Moffait, if
j he gets in, will nin the team until j
i Afflerbaugh takes over the left half
' post, when Hulen would call the :
plays.
Last Practice Held
Punting will be handled by Cad- !
del with Moffatt and Afflerbaugh
| taking over.the responsibility when ;
j they enter the game.
The squad held its last practice
jon the campus yesterday, leaving
j for Castle wood Country Club fol-
I lowing the rally last night. The
learn will remain in seclusion until
I game time Saturday.
I Meanwhile, over at Berkeley |
| Coach Bill Ingram continued to I
: drive his team hard, holding another
| scrimmage and promising more hard j
i work for today. He collected two j
; more injuries for his pains last j
night, Watkins again injuring his !
loot and Stone receiving another i
J finger injury.
Injured Players
! Watkins had to be assisted from i
i the field, and may not be able to j
play Saturday. He was not counted
| on for a great deal of service, but
ii was hoped thai his educated ioe ;
would aid the Bears during at least
[ part of the contest,
Castro, with ?l pulled tendon in 1
i his foot, and Gill, with a straying
■ nerve in his shoulder, will be on the !
i field at the kickoff if they do not j
incur further injuries today or Fri
|day.

Two signal-callers are included ;

i Afflerbaugh takes over the left half

plays.
Last Practice Held

I lowing the rally last night. The
learn will remain in seclusion until
I game time Saturday.
I Meanwhile, over at Berkeley |
| Coach Bill Ingram continued to I
: drive his team hard, holding another
| scrimmage and promising more hard j
i work for today. He collected two j
; more injuries for his pains last j
night, Watkins again injuring his !
loot and Stone receiving another i
J finger injury.
Injured Players
! Watkins had to be assisted from i
i the field, and may not be able to j
play Saturday. He was not counted
| on for a great deal of service, but
ii was hoped thai his educated ioe ;
would aid the Bears during at least
[ part of the contest,
Castro, with ?l pulled tendon in 1
i his foot, and Gill, with a straying
■ nerve in his shoulder, will be on the !
i field at the kickoff if they do not j
incur further injuries today or Fri
|day.
Rintala at fullback.
i Hardy at left half.
Hulen at left guard.
These were the highlights of the j
I official starting lineup for the Big
I Game Saturday, announced last J
! night by Pop Warner.
Rudy Rintala, handy man of the
Cardinal squad who played last
year at left half, switched to right (
half this season and was finally
j shunted to fullback when Caddel
1 moved back to right wingback, re
places Dusty Allen.
Allen Is Mainstay
Allen has been the mainstay of
the Indian passing attack this sea
j son, and while Rintala is quite a
i passer himself, Warner's announce
; ment came as a great surprise. It
| may indicate that the Old Man is

I planning a running attack for the |
! early part of the game.
It was expected that Pop would
name Hardy at left half, although
j there was a possibility that either :
Moffatt or Afflerbaugh would draw ;
the assignment. It is not definitely
settled yet if Moffatt will be able to ; 1
play, but if he is, he will go in for
| Hardy, with Afflerbaugh in resei've.
Hulen edges out Bigelow at left
i guard, regaining a position he re- i
i garded as his own at the first of
1 the season. Bigelow developed fast ,
I and drew the starting assignment in !
the U.S.C. game, but Hulen, who re- !
I placed him, made a better showing 1
j in that contest.
Positions Filled
Three other positions, regarded |
! as slightly doubtful, were filled as '
expected—Colvin at left end rather ;
than Neill, Marks at center instead
1 of Milligan, and Doub at right end
| over Norgard, Reynolds, and Clark. |
