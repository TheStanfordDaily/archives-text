### 
"Stanford will not be outfought by California in the Big Game."
That was Pop Warner's promise to the assembled multitude at the nig
Game rally last night. Whether or not it raised Cardinal stock any is
beside the question, but it certainly served to fan the often-deplored
Stanford spirit to a higher pitch than it has been all year.
And when Dan Evans finished his rapid-fire fight talk, the Stanford
rough turned around and said to his neighbor, "Well, well, 1 guess we'll
♦ win this ball game after all."

! Promises Battle
"If anybody tells me the Stanford
I team didn't fight in the U.S.C. game
! —didn't give everything it had
! ever# minute —I simply won't be
lieve him," Pop declared. "I know
i these boys pretty well. I know
I they're going tc fight, and fight
| hard, in Saturday's game, and they
will NOT be outfought by the
' Bears."
After the Old Fox finished
squelching rumors about a fightless
Indian football team, Dan Evans
[ tossed in his hat as champion of
; the student body.
Evans Lauds Spirit
"They say you haven't got any
; spirit," he shouted. "As far as I
can see, you're no different from
i any of the student bodies of the
| past, except that maybe you are a
little cleaner. But as far as spirit
is concerned, it's here just as much
! as it ever was. But for the passage
, ol time and the grace of God here
I sits the Class of '95.
"And I know what I'm talking
i about when I say this team is a
! fighting bunch, because I went to
Stanford in the days before the
Stanford Indian, clawed by a raging
Bear, had learned there was such
a thing as Pop Warner's gunpow
der."
Hilhnan Talks
Captain Harry Hillman said he
was "not going to make any prom
ises this time." but he seconded
Warner's promise lhat the team will
give its all in the Big Game. .
"Except for the loss of two of
our best players, Moffatt and Tod,
' we are in excellent shape for the
game, he said, "and we're going to
fight as hard as we know how."
The only other feature of the rally
was the presentation of Bozo, who
'died a natural death. It is estimated
: that at least half of the 3,000 people
j who attended arc still trying to find
| out what became of the bear.
