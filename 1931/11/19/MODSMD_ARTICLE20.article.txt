# Indians' Fiery Warning Given Bear Invaders
## Omen Good As Cards Again Foil California 
### 
Down came the Campanile in j
fierly splendor as 2500 sons and
daughters of the Cardinal shouted
defiance at California under a
flame-streaked sky.
And so another bonfire went up ;
in smoke—at once a nose-thumbing !
at the Golden Bear and a tribute j
to the labor and vigilance of the
Class of '35. Four days ago Cali
fornians were betting two to one ;
that Stanford would never light I
its own bonfire. Last night a howl- '
ing crew of Redshirt supporters I
chanted "Poor Cal" with maniacal !
glee.
Berkeleyans have tried to ignite I
their funeral pyres before, but there
was a soul-satisfying joy in watch
ing last night's spectacle. Not until
four men had lighted the structure
at each corner and the flames had
licked up the oil-soaked sides did
the crowd know for a certainty that
the bonfire was Stanford's.
Thick black smoke poured from
the 40-foot base, drenched with
1,000 gallons of oil. For a short ,
peiiod the clouds of smoke obscured '
the 30-foot superstructure; then the
flames caught and in a brief moment
the entire pile was a mass of orange I
fire. Slowly the lower part of \he '
Campaile gave way; then it came
crashing down as California's hopes
for victory, riding high now, must
cpme crashing down next Saturday
afternoon.
