An act of vandalism worthy only of a savage in his
worst mood was committed Tuesday night when the side
walk of the Quad running past the mineralogy building
was smeared with yellow and blue paint.
A crude figure of an axe, "Bears", l.'i, S.-0", "Cal
and other words stared up at the students as they hastened
to 1 heir eight o'elocks.
It is hard to realize that anyone could he so depraved
as to daub the university buildings with paint. The paint
ing of California's big "C" and the attempts to burn the
bonfire, while violations of the agreement between the two
schools, can be more easily passed over as outbursts of en
thusiasm inspired by the approaching Big Came.
However, defacing the university buildings or similar
acts of vandalism cannot be so lightly overlooked for they
violate not only the agreement hut a sense of decency and
respect for property as well.
