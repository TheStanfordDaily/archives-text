# WE STAND OUR GROUND

Arthur McKwen, who is bv wav of becoming almost the
* .
sole reason for the existence of a Campus Opinion column, j
has forwarded to the Daily his latest literary effort, which
appears elsewhere on this page. McKwen takes exception
to Tuesday's editorial concerning a San Francisco news-1
paper and its Stanford correspondent, and he feels that aj
recurrence of such an attack should cause "self-respectingj
members of the Daily staff to lay down their pencils and
cover their typewriters in protest."
"Cultured patrons of the Daily," adds McKwen, "will
unite in condemning the editorial as a vicious personal at
tack that should never have been printed."
McKwen, to date, is the only standard-bearer of Culture |
to write the Daily in that vein. Furthermore, no members
of the Daily staff have as yet followed McKwen"s sugges- j
lion to hand in their resignations in protest, but perhaps!
Ilieir natures are less sensitive to cultural affronts than his. i
The Daily, lo whatever it must plead guilty in this con-1
nection, will certainly not admit the justice of McKwin's
charges. The criticism of the Call-Hulletin correspondent)
was directed at him in his capacity as a newspaper cor
respondent and for no other reason. It was not a personal
quarrel, inasmuch as Monteagle, as a correspondent, was
representing the entire Stanford campus to San Francisco |
readers. The editorial was signed because it used Mont
eagle's name, and because the writer felt that Monteagle
should know who was criticizing him.
McKwen, it should be noticed, does not attempt to deny
that the story in question was distorted. He merely seeks
to minimize its importance by a hair-splitting and not at
all clear distinction between "sensational" and "striking"
stories. The Daily will grant that the University will suffer
no great specific harm from one such twisted account, but
as Tuesday's editorial pointed out, such distortion has been
going on in the Call-Hulletin for over a year. McEwen,
spending his first quarter at Stanford, is not in a position
to appreciate that, and having been, for a short time this
fall, Stanford correspondent for another San Francisco
paper, might reasonably expect to have a one-sided outlook j
on the subject. The Daily feels that such continued dis-|
tortion is harmful to the University and not half so funny
;is McKwen would have us believe.
In closing, McKwen asks the Daily "to explain the fact
lhat every edition of the newspaper containing the raid I
story was quickly sold out on Palo Alio news-stands."
The Daily hesitates to dignify such an asinine request:
with a serious answer, but to demonstrate lo McKwen thai
it is sidestepping none of his charges, it would like to point
out that an eight-column streamer headline with the word
"Stanford" in it is very likely to sell any paper to anv Palo
Alto resident or Stanford student. Furthermore, the Daily
would like to suggest that the average human being reads
;i 'news story AFTKR he purchases the paper.
