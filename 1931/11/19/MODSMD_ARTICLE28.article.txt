# BULL SESSION
## WHAT NEXT? 
### 
With sirens sounding their warn
ing calls at all hours of the night;
with streets blockaded; with ihe
necessity of proving one's identity
to armed guards before entering
within throwing distance of the
Holy Pyre; with strange persons
walking the campus; with zealous
frosh eyeing everyone with militant
suspicion; with ominous rumors fly
ing thicker than words at a com
munist gathering; and with artistic
members of this Bay Region un
leashing their pent-up feelings in
oil paint with two campuses as their
canvasses —one can stop and won
der whether this is a high-school
affair or a university athletic con
test that is to come off this Satur
day.
With the mounting list of casual
ties, this affair is quickly assuming
the aspect of a war. May the Bull
Session suggest that in the future,
the U.S. army miiy be called out.
Block all highways leading to this
area; blow out the bridges leading
across the bay; stop the ferry boats;
sweep the skies with alert scouting
planes reinforced by heavier bomb
ing planes; concentrate the navy in
the Bay but leave fast scouting
cruisers on the coast behind the
campus to prevent any flanking
movements; and by all means watch
the Panama Canal to prevent any
Cal men from slipping out of Berke
ley's back door, hot-footing it to
New York and from there by sea
through the Canal and up to Stan
ford. Only by such mild precautions
can the Campus be reasonably safe.
As long as Stanford was only sup
posed to paint the "C"; and Berke
ley was only to burn the bonfire,
the field of operations was relatively
small. But, now, as is the case with
modern war, the whole country is
at war. Yesterday morning, some
bodies stole up to the Mineralology

! Building and smeared some Hy
| Grade House Paint over about 50
feet of the quad. Nobody is safe
now, or in the future. The war is
on; and the dread spectre of battle
is riding over the Farm.
Now, all this frosh-business that
'is happening on both campuses
' makes wonderful copy for the City
| papers—whose readers delight in
knowing that collegians are all the
I things the movies claim they are.
It also provides great material from
which to weave tales for one's
[ grandchildren. But aside from this,
| the whole affair seems adolescent
i and ridiculous in the extreme.
First of all, in the raiding several
men were seriously injured and one
man almost lost his eye. If he had,
;it is very likely that bonfires at
: Stanford would have become a dead
1 tradition. Tuesday night the frosh
! were armed with clubs big enough
to have bashed open heads with
alarming ease. Thank somebody that
no raid came that night. To set the
fire off cleverly and without attacks
I may be justified by some, but to
think that the success of a rally
may depend on serious injuries is
I preposterous.
i Rumor has it that everything from
! the Campanile to the President's
bathtub has been painted "red" up
; at Cal. If anything has been painted
there by Stanford, we deserve con
demnation. If Cal is responsible for
I the smearings here they merit simi-
I lar opinion. If two universities can't
| conduct athletic relations with de
| cent enthusiasm and minus the
provincial and sophomoric displays
j we have all been subjected to, then
' it may be that those that claim col
-1 legians are still high-school minded
j may be correct; and what is more
I important, perhaps, to some, both
I schools may lose their cut in the
1 Big Game gate receipts, approach
i ing $500,000. —Abe Mellinkof?
