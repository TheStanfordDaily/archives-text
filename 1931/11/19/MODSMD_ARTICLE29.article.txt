—Edited by Frederick A. Blossom.
Albert and Charles Boni. New
York, 1931. (At the Stanford
Bookstore. $3.50.)
A collection of hitherto unprinted, j
true tales of modern exploration. If
you're a reader of the Street & '
Smith type of magazine, you'll en
joy this book. But if you can dis- j
tinguish between H. M. Tomlinson
and F.verett T. Tomlinson this vol
ume is not for you.
Most of the 30 or so varieties are \
written by men whom Hearst and ,
the N.Y. Times fondly believe to be i
modern Magellans, but included in i
modern Magellans, but included are !
Charles Lindbergh, and Stefansson.
The Carveth Wells and Sir Hubert
Wilkins clan predominates, however. !
It is the latter type who are re
sponsible for most of the numerous i
names of Roy Chapman Andrews, |
A typical excerpt: "the jungle— j
amid crawling insects and poisonous
snakes. It seemed a week as I stood
there in the blazing sun, . . . my
knees shaking."
It should make a lot of money in

the Christmas trade", if they shift it
: pictures of "The Author."

HIE SILENT WITNESS—At the
Curran Theatre, San Francisco.
From the standpoint of acting and
! characterization, a definite success.
As a mystery thriller, not so good,
j All mysterious incidents are self
( explained by inserted scenes on the
other half of a very tricky revolving
' stage. The thrills consist of seeing
I a very attractive woman choked to
, death three times. Good clean melo
j drama, all of it.
The faults lie entirely with the
i author of the play, however, and
; bouquets in large armfuls go to
many of the cast. Helene Millard
!as Sonya Barova, the beautiful
j blonde grafter, and Lionel Atwill,
I who plays the father who pleads
: guilty to a crime committed by his
i son, take first honors. The court
room scene in the second act is
very effectively staged, and the
audience, appointed jurymen, are
j made to feel the importance of the
| situation, with an innocent man on

trial for murder, and all the evi
dence going against him. —M.L.J.
GET - RICH - QUICK WALLING -
FORD—At the Varsity Theatre.
Some swell lines, sure-fire gags,
and Jimmy Durante, make this old
favorite great entertainment. Du
rante is a class A comedian and
practically steals the show. William
Haines and Ernest Torrence are the
two slick confidence men who turn
straight in Ihe end after stealing
the shirts from the small-town
bankers.
Durante has one awfully funny
line. "I got a letter from my goil,"
he says, "and she says she had a
swell room with running water. I
wired right back, 'Get rid of that
Indian!'" —R.J.F.
