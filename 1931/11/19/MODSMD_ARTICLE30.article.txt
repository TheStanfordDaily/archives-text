The Editor, Sir:
Only a fair paper is worthy of
its readers' respect and only a just j
I editorial deserves attention.
But, because the Daily and the
; signed editorial in the Tuesday |
paper, attacking a metropolitan !
newspaper and its campus corrres- |
pondent, fail to meet either of these
qualifications, the paper and its staff
deserve the well-earned scorn and
discredit from readers of the article
m question.
Cultured patrons of the Daily will
unite in condemning the editorial
as a vicious attack that never should
have been printed in a Stanford
■ publication. If such things are likely
! to occur again on any occasion, it is
reasonable to expert here and now
that honest, self-respecting mem
bers of the Daily staff will lay down
their pencils and cover their type
writers in protest.
Though the perpetrator of this
tirade admits his duel of epithets
has no place in the Daily editorial
1 column, it is evident that his in
fluence as a member of the staff
caused it to be placed there.
As to the object of the verbal
siege, the news story published
: about the bonfire raid is certainly
no more a cause of fanatical frenzy
than any account of the affair ap
pearing in other newspapers of the
| bay region.
The entire story, regardless of
| certain details claimed by the edi
torial to be mere figments of a fer
tile imagination, harms no one and
brings no discredit upon any stu
dents involved, or even the two uni-
I versities. The story is not "sensa
tional"; it is merely "striking."
Please make careful observation of
1 this distinction.
Though the story is quite harm
less and should be taken in good
humor (which is yet to be found
in the Daily editorial), our self
; made crucifixionist believes inno
| cently that Stanford readers are
tired of it. Can this facile critic of
journalism explain with his able
pen the fact that every edition of
the newspaper containing the raid
story was quickly sold out on Palo
Alto news stands?
Readers of the Daily will soon
, become weary, if not altogether dis
gusted, with its newly introduced
personal-attack poiicy. They are al
ready offended and should join in
demanding a printed apology.
Sincerely,
Arthur McEwen

demanding a printed apology.
Sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
Only a fair paper is worthy of
its readers' respect and only a just j
I editorial deserves attention.
But, because the Daily and the
; signed editorial in the Tuesday |
paper, attacking a metropolitan !
newspaper and its campus corrres- |
pondent, fail to meet either of these
qualifications, the paper and its staff
deserve the well-earned scorn and
discredit from readers of the article
m question.
Cultured patrons of the Daily will
unite in condemning the editorial
as a vicious attack that never should
have been printed in a Stanford
■ publication. If such things are likely
! to occur again on any occasion, it is
reasonable to expert here and now
that honest, self-respecting mem
bers of the Daily staff will lay down
their pencils and cover their type
writers in protest.
Though the perpetrator of this
tirade admits his duel of epithets
has no place in the Daily editorial
1 column, it is evident that his in
fluence as a member of the staff
caused it to be placed there.
As to the object of the verbal
siege, the news story published
: about the bonfire raid is certainly
no more a cause of fanatical frenzy
than any account of the affair ap
pearing in other newspapers of the
| bay region.
The entire story, regardless of
| certain details claimed by the edi
torial to be mere figments of a fer
tile imagination, harms no one and
brings no discredit upon any stu
dents involved, or even the two uni-
I versities. The story is not "sensa
tional"; it is merely "striking."
Please make careful observation of
1 this distinction.
Though the story is quite harm
less and should be taken in good
humor (which is yet to be found
in the Daily editorial), our self
; made crucifixionist believes inno
| cently that Stanford readers are
tired of it. Can this facile critic of
journalism explain with his able
pen the fact that every edition of
the newspaper containing the raid
story was quickly sold out on Palo
Alto news stands?
Readers of the Daily will soon
, become weary, if not altogether dis
gusted, with its newly introduced
personal-attack poiicy. They are al
ready offended and should join in
demanding a printed apology.
Sincerely,
Arthur McEwen
