Since the depression many
college students are *not only
earning their own way through
school but are contributing to
the support of the family.—
News item.
Dear Dad,
Your letter telling how much
you were improving in your
work at home and asking for
another fifty dollars has been
received. I am enclosing the
fifty, but must ask you again 10
economize as much as you can.
Your daughter and I wish to
see you get the most out of
home life, but you must realize
that we cannot afford to let you
spend money like some other
parents.
Regarding your proposed trip
to Los Angeles this Christmas
vacation, I think you had better
reconsider and stay home. Don't
forget that even if you are away
from us most of the time we are
anxious to see you when we can.
And as to that invitation from
the Denneys, are they our kind
of people? You must be careful
of the connections you make.
I note in the paper that you
put over your deal and got
quite a commendation from the
authorities. I don't have to re
peat how proud I am of you.
Keep up the good work and tell
mother not to fall down on her
bridge playing.
Affectionately,
Your son
