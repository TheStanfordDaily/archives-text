IT'S STILL the BIG Game.
Down at Southern California they
are making a desperate effort to
make the Stanford-U.S.C. aftairthe
major event of coast football. Maj be
it is, as far as they are concerned,
but the real Largo Contest of the
bay region is still the annual Bear-
Indian argument.
Before the Trojan game there
is always reasonable interest in
football affairs. An ordinary
sized crowd turned out before
this year's tilt, for instance, to
cheer a somewhat embarrassed
horse at the U.S.C. rally. A great
many from the Farm made tlx;
trip to Los Angeles to see the
contest.

BUT NOTICE the difference be- ;
fore the Big Fracas. A mob attended j
the rally lust night—and it v/as a ,
mob that wanted Bear meat.
What with raids and counter
raids, editorial blasts and coun
ter-blasts, impromptu rallies,
and what-not, the pre-game
spirit shown on both the Farm
and the Berkeley lot so far ex
ceeds that before the Trojan
contest that the latter seems
mild by comparison.
Yes, it's still the Big Game.
WE UNDERSTAND that Brick j
Morse, crystal-gazer, astrologist, j
and bunco artist notorious, is going !
to blast forth tomorrow afternoon
with a forecast that will shake the i
universe.
A bit exaggerated, of course,
because it is common knowledge
that the only part of the uni- )
verse reached by the Call-Bul- |
letin is the Bay Region. 1
But without stopping to ponder j
the strength of the reverberations j
to be caused by Morse's blast, let j
us pity the poor, misguided follow- j
ers of Brick, who will undoubtedly ;
make the journey to the Farm j
equipped with a copious assortment |
of super-absorbent handkerchiefs, |
prepared to shed a tear for the i
poor old Indian.
"S A Y FEL L E R S," said
"Frenchy" Lacombe as he stuck
bis head into the huddle as the
gun was about to end last Sat
urday's game with Nevada, "I
gotta swell new idea for a play."
He proceeded to draw dia
grams on the turf. The team ;
lined up, the ball was snapped, |
and Hancock faded back to pass.
Lacombe flashed into the open,
snagged the ball, and ran to a j
touchdown.
New play, or old, it worked.
