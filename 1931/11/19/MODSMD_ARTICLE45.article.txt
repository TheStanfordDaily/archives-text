# VARSITY SOCCERMEN PREPARE FOR THIRD GAME WITH BEARS
## 
### 
Getting back to work after its
three-day vacation, the varsity soc
cer team went through a hard dtill
against the second string last night
in preparation for the third game
with California next Saturday.
If the varsity is to start intact,
they will have to show more than
they were able to last night. Burks,
j of the second string, tallied the first
goal against them, and Sutow, of
! the freshmen, kicked the second.
The best the first-string men
could do was one lone goal by Art
Hearn on a pass from Knecht, near
the end of the scrimmage. In de
fense of the varsity, perhaps it
: should be said that they were try
ing to score against the first-string
backs, something that other teams
| in the league have been trying to
; do, unsuccessfully, all season.
The showing of several of the
freshmen against the varsity today
| made Coach Eberhart mumble
| .something about another game with
j the Cubs. The yearlings are just
beginning to round into shape, and
I would probably give the Cubs a
| real run for their money.
It costs the American taxpayer
.approximately two cents of every
$100 he pays in taxes to keep up
the expenses of the president and
j vice-president and to keep up the
I White House.
