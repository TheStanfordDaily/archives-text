# TRACK PROSPECTS WILL COMPETE IN MEET TOMORROW
## Ben Eastman Shows Early Season Form In Time Trial Recently 
### 
Boih Stanford's embryo and move
j reputable track men have been,
training conscientiously this past
week, and those of the boys v/ho
have concentrated this training on
tomorrow's track meet will be al
lowed to compete in the group of
i practice runs, jumps, and weight
-1 heaving contests. Although three
| quarter distances will be run in all
i events except the sprints and hur
| dies, the meet should be one of the
j best to date. Many old grads will
! be back to see what this year's edi
j tion of Templeton's warriors can do.
As usual, Ben Eastman in par
! ticular will be closely watched, as
j no one can tell when the blond ace
will step out to a new record of
some kind. Yesterday, Ben was
asked to run a 440 on the outside
of the track in 55 seconds, but try
as he would Ben could not run
slower than :53.2. Eastman took his
chastisement like a man, however,
and five minutes later did manage
to hold himself down to ::55.1.
Lyman Prospect
| The southpaw pride of Menlo
! Junior College—Bill Miller—was
also out yesterday, and he should
combine with Bert DeGroot and
Ned Johns to again make the pole
vault an interesting affair. The re
turning former Stanfordites will
also pay particular attention to John
• Lyman's shot-putting, as Lyman is
| a real Olympic prospect in this
1 event. Bob Jones' discus-throwing
ability is already well known, and
there is a chance that he will get
j the platter out over 150 feet for the
first time this year in tomorrow's
S meet.
There is a possibility that the fans
will be treated to a novel race if
j Bill Ellington carries out his threat
to run Dan Murphy and Horse
Guittard in the 669
Sam Eastman, who ran two nice
j quarters yesterday, will probably
| try to break the season's record in
| the 3-lap run tomorrow. The sprints
will find the old triumvirate—Giber
| son, A1 Blackman, and Ben East
! Man —again hitting the tape not
more than a yard apart.
"A" Distance Men
Stanford literally has three class
"A" distance men this yebr in the
persons of Aebersold, Azevedo, and
Atkinson. The first two of these
men will compete in the 6-lap run
i against Dave Devlin, and another
[ j close race should result. A1 Ray
■ j will have little trouble winning the
' javelin.

will step out to a new record of
some kind. Yesterday, Ben was
asked to run a 440 on the outside
of the track in 55 seconds, but try
as he would Ben could not run
slower than :53.2. Eastman took his
chastisement like a man, however,
and five minutes later did manage
to hold himself down to ::55.1.
Lyman Prospect
| The southpaw pride of Menlo
! Junior College—Bill Miller—was
also out yesterday, and he should
combine with Bert DeGroot and
Ned Johns to again make the pole
vault an interesting affair. The re
turning former Stanfordites will
also pay particular attention to John
• Lyman's shot-putting, as Lyman is
| a real Olympic prospect in this
1 event. Bob Jones' discus-throwing
ability is already well known, and
there is a chance that he will get
j the platter out over 150 feet for the
first time this year in tomorrow's
S meet.
There is a possibility that the fans
will be treated to a novel race if
j Bill Ellington carries out his threat
to run Dan Murphy and Horse
Guittard in the 669
Sam Eastman, who ran two nice
j quarters yesterday, will probably
| try to break the season's record in
| the 3-lap run tomorrow. The sprints
will find the old triumvirate—Giber
| son, A1 Blackman, and Ben East
! Man —again hitting the tape not
more than a yard apart.
"A" Distance Men
Stanford literally has three class
"A" distance men this yebr in the
persons of Aebersold, Azevedo, and
Atkinson. The first two of these
men will compete in the 6-lap run
i against Dave Devlin, and another
[ j close race should result. A1 Ray
■ j will have little trouble winning the
' javelin.
Boih Stanford's embryo and move
j reputable track men have been,
training conscientiously this past
week, and those of the boys v/ho
have concentrated this training on
tomorrow's track meet will be al
lowed to compete in the group of
i practice runs, jumps, and weight
-1 heaving contests. Although three
| quarter distances will be run in all
i events except the sprints and hur
| dies, the meet should be one of the
j best to date. Many old grads will
! be back to see what this year's edi
j tion of Templeton's warriors can do.
As usual, Ben Eastman in par
! ticular will be closely watched, as
j no one can tell when the blond ace
will step out to a new record of
some kind. Yesterday, Ben was
asked to run a 440 on the outside
of the track in 55 seconds, but try
