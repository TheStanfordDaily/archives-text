# VISITOR TO STATE PRISON COMMENDS EDUCATIONAL WORK
## Professor Bell Tells Of Penitentiary School At San Quentin 
### 
"We came away from our visit
to San Quentin with two profound
impressions," said Professor Regi
nald Bell of the School of Education
when questioned about his visit
with Howard C. Pattee and Henry
W. Magnuson to the State Peniten
tiary last week end.
"The first impression was that the
state, through its director of edu
cation at the prison, Mr. Shuder,
and its corps of 75 inmate teachers,
is doing a significant and valuable
piece of educational work. Over
2,000 or the 4,500 inmates are en
rolled in classroom or university
extension work.
College Men Teach
The curriculum offerings cover
an amazingly wide field in both
academic and vocational subjects,
and the instruction staff is unex
pectedly well-trained and inter
ested in its work.
"Their background, of course,
varies from grammar school educa
tion and long trade experience in
some of Ihe vocational courses to
Ph.D. and Master's degrees from
well-known universities. On our
trip through the classes we had
men with degrees from Stanford,
California, Johns Hopkins, and Chi
cago pointed out to us.
Justice Questioned
"The other impression grows out
of our inquiries as to why these
men were in prison. 'Make the pun
ishment fit the crime' is more than
ever a figment of the imagination,
after you reflect on the five-year
sentence of a Johns Hopkins gradu
ate who drew an eleven-dollar
check on a bank in which he had
no funds, for example. The primary
question with these men is not what
you do with the men in the institu
tion, but where is the fundamental
justice in the process and laws that
put them there?
