# BIG GAME TRAFFIC TO BE HANDLED BY AUGMENTED FORCES
## 
### 
More than 90 additional traffic of
ficers will be drawn to Palo Alto
in a concentration of forces to assist
the local department in the handling
of Big Game traffic Saturday. Oper
ations will probably be directed by
A. C. Geers, traffic representative
from Sacramento, according to in
formation received last night.
Should rainy weather continue,
parking facilities will be confined to
Palo Alto, according to Gordon
Davis, campus traffic officer. Muddy
ground conditions in the vicinity of
the Stadium will make this neces
sary, Davis stated.
Heavy traffic will be diverted
over the Skyline Boulevard, al
though the Bayshore Highway will
probably be open. All peninsula
traffic will be regulated in accord
ance with a timed schedule and
every possible means will be taken
to prevent unnecessary jams.
Nearly 45,000 cars were handled
at the Big Game last year. In spite
of the great increase in traffic, very
few Violations occur and the situa
tion in the past has been character
ized by a minimum of arrests.
