# FRENCH SOLONS CENSURE LAVAL
## Premier Asks For Report At House Debate 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 18. (/P) â€” Premier
Laval narrowly escaped today a
peremptory summons from the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the
French Chamber to appear and re
port mpre fully on the results of
his recent visits to Washington,
Berlin, and London.
A motion to that effect, sponsored
by Socialist opponents of the Pre
mier and Foreign Minister Briand,
was passed by the narrow margin
of 11 to 9. But some members in
duced the sponsors to modify their
resolution and it was converted into
a polite request asking him to ap
pear after the conclusion of cham
ber debate on foreign policy.
A demand that the Government
publish a "Yellow Book" on the
Franco-American Conference at
London and other capitals was made
by Deputy Henry Guernut. It was
also requested by Deputy Marius
Moutet that the committee be in
formed on preparations for the 1932
Disarmament Conference and the
League's efforts to settle the Man
churian conflict.
The committee also decided to ask
Minister of Finance Pierre Flandin
to explain loans made by the Bank
of France, together with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York to the
Bank of England.
