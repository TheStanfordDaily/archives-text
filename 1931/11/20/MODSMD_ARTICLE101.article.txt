# REPAIRS ON DOME OF AD BUILDING WELL UNDER WAY
## New Plan Used To Obviate Further Repairs On Lower Courses 
### 
Repairs arc weil under way on ,
the glass dome of the Administra
tion Building. This is a complete j
overhauling to remedy the accuinu- |
lative warping and sagging effects
of heat and cold upon the lead- ,
bound glass panels for the past 25
years, only minor repairs having
been done every two years in the i
latter part of this period.
Lead framework is being re
soldered at. the joints and re-wired, i
A new plan is being used to obviate i
further repairs, by having the glass
plates fastened to new steel rein
forcements which will divide the i
lower ring of panels horizontally j
into three rings. This work applies
chiefly to the lower course, the rest
of the dome being still in good
shape.
This project is part of the regular
maintenance work of the Univer
sity's corporation department, but is j
aided by a San Francisco i'irm
which has installed glass plates in i
several large churches of San Fran
cisco. |
Tables and benches have been ;
built among the steel framework of ;
the Administration Building, uu j
near the dome, that the laborers j
may work with their materials on :
the spot. Around the main lobby of |
the building tables and ropes keep
people from straying under the re
pair work and endangering their
safety.
