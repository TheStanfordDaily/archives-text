# IT'S THE OLD FOX AGAINST STEADY BILL IN BIG GAME
## Few 'Weak Sisters' Left In Pacific Coast Conference WESTERN GRID OUTFITS RAISE GAME CALIBER Idaho, U.C.L.A., Northern Teams Show Great Improvement LOOP PLAY IMPROVES, Indians, Bears Unable To Point For Clash 
### Mark Scholtz 
Beyond uil shadow of doubt the
Big Game is still THE game as far j
as tradition, honor, and glory are
concemed: yet, as we look at the ]
impending Stanford - California ;
clash, we cannot help but realize !
that from a purely technical stand- ,
point the game will be no harder i
for either team than many other
games that they have already par- j
ticipated in this season. And what ;
does this indicate?
Obviously it is an indication that j
the caliber of Pacific Coast Con
ference football has heen decidedly j
011 the upgrade during the past few ;
years, and that there are very few j
"weak sisters" left in the major loop J
of Western collegiate football.
Big Th ree
There was a time when Stanford,
California, and Southern California 1
comprised the Big Th ree, with '
Washington an ever-present threat.
The rest of the teams were more or
less weak and ofTered not a great
deal of competition lor the quartet
that rulcd the roost in the Confer- !
ence race.
With such eonditions generally :
prevalent, the big teams were prone j
to point for one another and virtu- j
ally ignore the weaker elevens.
Thus, the annual Ctanford-Califoi
nia clash, in addition to being the
Big Game, was prcbably the tough
est game to be played by eitner i
team during the season, and it nc
quired a doublé significance.
Outlook Changcd
At the present time the situation '
is quile different, for the tonner un
important teams have become de
eidcd threats to the supremacy of
the Big Four. Last year marked the
high point in such developmeni
when Washington State, one of the
former "weak sisters,'' walked ofT
with th<- title, humbiing the mighty , j
Trojan.s 111 a closely contested battle. j
That was the first time in many j
vears that one ol the four larger j
elevens did not finish on top.
Other schools show similar devel- f
opment... The two Oregon institu- ]
tions. (He University of Oregon and > r
Oregon State College, have come, v
rapidly to the front and cannot be s
taken lightly by any squad on the (
Coast. And if they cannot knock ofT I
the Trojans or Stanford, they al- I
v.ay eonif through in an intersec- I
tional contest to uphold the good c
name cjf Western football. s
ldalio, U.C.L.A. Improvc
Idaho, under Leo Calland, a for- I
rnir Trojan and a vei'y capable men- (
tor, recently gave Washington State >
a t< rrific ':are, the li)30 champions ,
(mally eking out a two point mar- v
.in ol victoiy bv a well-placed 2-1- j
yard drop • kick. Considering the
scarcity of malerial which he has
to draw from, Culland certainly has
done well.
Probably the most phenomenal
iise of uil is that enjoyed by the
fast-moving U.C.L.A. Bruins from
Westwood. Seven years ago the
Bruins could not win a game in a
minor college league in the South
ealled the Southern Conference.
During the present season, their
fourth in the Big Conference and
fihh under Bi 11 Spaulding, the for
mer Minnesota coach, the youngest
members of the loop played Stan
ford to a standstill, oniy to be
robbed of a tie when the long arms
of Don Colvin and the accurate
passing of Dusty Allen snatched a
victory for the Indians in the last
eight seconds of play.
Not satisfied with that, the am
bitious Bruins went out and de
cisively defeated the St. Mary's
elcven that had trounced U.S.C. and
California in previous contests this
soason. Their third claim to fame
was holding Northwestern to three
touchdowns despite the fact that
the Purple had their regulars in for
52 minutes of the game.
Can't Point for Game
That is why, from a technical
standpoint, neither California nor
Stanford can afford to point to the
Big Game as they have in the past.
With every team that is met capa'ole
of administering a defeat, the squad
must be kept at top speed through
out the season or expect to drop a
couple of games. The Big Four are
no longer resting easily on the top
of the Conference heap and must
constantly look to their laurels.
Yet, whilo the general rsise in the
sturidard of Pacific Coast Conference
teams has made the entire season a
hcctic one, the Big Game still re
mains as the mest coveted goal of all
Stanfcrd students and alumni, not to
mention the team itselfl The bitter
ness of a defeat at the hands of the
Trojans can be virtually wipe'd out
by a Big Game victory. Somehow,
it seems as though the season is a

• success if the California clash is
won, and the glory which attends
j such a victory remains undimmed
! by other mishaps.

Outlook Changcd
At the present time the situation '
is quile different, for the tonner un
important teams have become de
eidcd threats to the supremacy of
the Big Four. Last year marked the
high point in such developmeni
when Washington State, one of the
former "weak sisters,'' walked ofT
with th<- title, humbiing the mighty , j
Trojan.s 111 a closely contested battle. j
That was the first time in many j
vears that one ol the four larger j
elevens did not finish on top.
Other schools show similar devel- f
opment... The two Oregon institu- ]
tions. (He University of Oregon and > r
Oregon State College, have come, v
rapidly to the front and cannot be s
taken lightly by any squad on the (
Coast. And if they cannot knock ofT I
the Trojans or Stanford, they al- I
v.ay eonif through in an intersec- I
tional contest to uphold the good c
name cjf Western football. s

.in ol victoiy bv a well-placed 2-1- j

scarcity of malerial which he has
to draw from, Culland certainly has
done well.
Probably the most phenomenal
iise of uil is that enjoyed by the
fast-moving U.C.L.A. Bruins from
Westwood. Seven years ago the
Bruins could not win a game in a
minor college league in the South
ealled the Southern Conference.
During the present season, their
fourth in the Big Conference and
fihh under Bi 11 Spaulding, the for
mer Minnesota coach, the youngest
members of the loop played Stan
ford to a standstill, oniy to be
robbed of a tie when the long arms
of Don Colvin and the accurate
passing of Dusty Allen snatched a
victory for the Indians in the last
eight seconds of play.
Not satisfied with that, the am
bitious Bruins went out and de
cisively defeated the St. Mary's
elcven that had trounced U.S.C. and
California in previous contests this
soason. Their third claim to fame
was holding Northwestern to three
touchdowns despite the fact that
the Purple had their regulars in for
52 minutes of the game.
Can't Point for Game
That is why, from a technical
standpoint, neither California nor
Stanford can afford to point to the
Big Game as they have in the past.
With every team that is met capa'ole
of administering a defeat, the squad
must be kept at top speed through
out the season or expect to drop a
couple of games. The Big Four are
no longer resting easily on the top
of the Conference heap and must
constantly look to their laurels.
Yet, whilo the general rsise in the
sturidard of Pacific Coast Conference
teams has made the entire season a
hcctic one, the Big Game still re
mains as the mest coveted goal of all
Stanfcrd students and alumni, not to
mention the team itselfl The bitter
ness of a defeat at the hands of the
Trojans can be virtually wipe'd out
by a Big Game victory. Somehow,
it seems as though the season is a

• success if the California clash is
won, and the glory which attends
j such a victory remains undimmed
! by other mishaps.
Beyond uil shadow of doubt the
Big Game is still THE game as far j
as tradition, honor, and glory are
concemed: yet, as we look at the ]
impending Stanford - California ;
clash, we cannot help but realize !
that from a purely technical stand- ,
point the game will be no harder i
for either team than many other
games that they have already par- j
ticipated in this season. And what ;
does this indicate?
Obviously it is an indication that j
the caliber of Pacific Coast Con
ference football has heen decidedly j
011 the upgrade during the past few ;
years, and that there are very few j
"weak sisters" left in the major loop J
of Western collegiate football.
Big Th ree
There was a time when Stanford,
California, and Southern California 1
comprised the Big Th ree, with '
Washington an ever-present threat.
The rest of the teams were more or
less weak and ofTered not a great
deal of competition lor the quartet
that rulcd the roost in the Confer- !

With such eonditions generally :
prevalent, the big teams were prone j
to point for one another and virtu- j

scarcity of malerial which he has
to draw from, Culland certainly has
done well.
Probably the most phenomenal
iise of uil is that enjoyed by the
fast-moving U.C.L.A. Bruins from
Westwood. Seven years ago the
Bruins could not win a game in a
minor college league in the South
ealled the Southern Conference.
During the present season, their
fourth in the Big Conference and
fihh under Bi 11 Spaulding, the for
mer Minnesota coach, the youngest
members of the loop played Stan
ford to a standstill, oniy to be
robbed of a tie when the long arms
of Don Colvin and the accurate
passing of Dusty Allen snatched a
victory for the Indians in the last
eight seconds of play.
Not satisfied with that, the am
bitious Bruins went out and de
cisively defeated the St. Mary's
elcven that had trounced U.S.C. and
California in previous contests this
soason. Their third claim to fame
was holding Northwestern to three
touchdowns despite the fact that
the Purple had their regulars in for
52 minutes of the game.
Can't Point for Game
That is why, from a technical
standpoint, neither California nor
Stanford can afford to point to the
Big Game as they have in the past.
With every team that is met capa'ole
of administering a defeat, the squad
must be kept at top speed through
out the season or expect to drop a
couple of games. The Big Four are
no longer resting easily on the top
of the Conference heap and must
constantly look to their laurels.
Yet, whilo the general rsise in the
sturidard of Pacific Coast Conference
teams has made the entire season a
hcctic one, the Big Game still re
mains as the mest coveted goal of all
Stanfcrd students and alumni, not to
mention the team itselfl The bitter
ness of a defeat at the hands of the
Trojans can be virtually wipe'd out
by a Big Game victory. Somehow,
it seems as though the season is a

• success if the California clash is
won, and the glory which attends
j such a victory remains undimmed
! by other mishaps.
Beyond uil shadow of doubt the
Big Game is still THE game as far j
as tradition, honor, and glory are
concemed: yet, as we look at the ]
impending Stanford - California ;
clash, we cannot help but realize !
that from a purely technical stand- ,
point the game will be no harder i
for either team than many other
games that they have already par- j
ticipated in this season. And what ;
does this indicate?
Obviously it is an indication that j
the caliber of Pacific Coast Con
ference football has heen decidedly j
011 the upgrade during the past few ;
years, and that there are very few j
"weak sisters" left in the major loop J
of Western collegiate football.
Big Th ree
There was a time when Stanford,
California, and Southern California 1
comprised the Big Th ree, with '
Washington an ever-present threat.
The rest of the teams were more or
less weak and ofTered not a great
deal of competition lor the quartet
that rulcd the roost in the Confer- !
ence race.
With such eonditions generally :
prevalent, the big teams were prone j
to point for one another and virtu- j
ally ignore the weaker elevens.
Thus, the annual Ctanford-Califoi
nia clash, in addition to being the
Big Game, was prcbably the tough
est game to be played by eitner i
team during the season, and it nc
quired a doublé significance.
Outlook Changcd
At the present time the situation '
is quile different, for the tonner un
important teams have become de
eidcd threats to the supremacy of
the Big Four. Last year marked the
high point in such developmeni
when Washington State, one of the
former "weak sisters,'' walked ofT
with th<- title, humbiing the mighty , j
Trojan.s 111 a closely contested battle. j
That was the first time in many j

elevens did not finish on top.
