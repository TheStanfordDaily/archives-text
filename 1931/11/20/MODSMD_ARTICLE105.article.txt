Beyond uil shadow of doubt the
Big Game is still THE game as far j
as tradition, honor, and glory are
concemed: yet, as we look at the ]
impending Stanford - California ;
clash, we cannot help but realize !
that from a purely technical stand- ,
point the game will be no harder i
for either team than many other
games that they have already par- j
ticipated in this season. And what ;
does this indicate?
Obviously it is an indication that j
the caliber of Pacific Coast Con
ference football has heen decidedly j
011 the upgrade during the past few ;
years, and that there are very few j
"weak sisters" left in the major loop J
of Western collegiate football.
Big Th ree
There was a time when Stanford,
California, and Southern California 1
comprised the Big Th ree, with '
Washington an ever-present threat.
The rest of the teams were more or
less weak and ofTered not a great
deal of competition lor the quartet
that rulcd the roost in the Confer- !
ence race.
With such eonditions generally :
prevalent, the big teams were prone j
to point for one another and virtu- j
ally ignore the weaker elevens.
Thus, the annual Ctanford-Califoi
nia clash, in addition to being the
Big Game, was prcbably the tough
est game to be played by eitner i
team during the season, and it nc
quired a doublé significance.
Outlook Changcd
At the present time the situation '
is quile different, for the tonner un
important teams have become de
eidcd threats to the supremacy of
the Big Four. Last year marked the
high point in such developmeni
when Washington State, one of the
former "weak sisters,'' walked ofT
with th<- title, humbiing the mighty , j
Trojan.s 111 a closely contested battle. j
That was the first time in many j
vears that one ol the four larger j
elevens did not finish on top.
Other schools show similar devel- f
opment... The two Oregon institu- ]
tions. (He University of Oregon and > r
Oregon State College, have come, v
rapidly to the front and cannot be s
taken lightly by any squad on the (
Coast. And if they cannot knock ofT I
the Trojans or Stanford, they al- I
v.ay eonif through in an intersec- I
tional contest to uphold the good c
name cjf Western football. s
