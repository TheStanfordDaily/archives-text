# CALIFORNIA GETS NUMEROUS STARS FROM GILL CLAN
## 
### 
If California football teams
seem never to lack for man
power, the biggest single factor
is the Gill family of Orcutt,
California, which has contrib
uted four varsity men already,
and has another ready for next
year.
Two of the Gills, Frank and
Harry, have just played six
years between them at the
Berkeley school. Attending the
state university now are "Rus
ty," star fullback, Sam, a
guard, and Carol, freshman
end.
And to top off the grand
march, eventually at least,
comes the sixth Gill brother,
who is now 12 years old.
