-a.son. The graduating men include:
laptain Harry Hillinan, quarter;
'hil Moffatt. left halfback; "Chuck"
Ihrhorn, tackle; Ray Hulen, guard;
tudy Rintala, fullback; Phil Neill,
nd; Ray Dawson, guard; Pete Hei
or, guard; Norman McLeod, center;
Spud' Hardy, halfback; George A
)ohrmann, guard; Mike Reynolds, *
!arl Wittenau, and Ned Clark, ends. ,
The gaps made by the loss of Hill—
urn, Moffatt, Hardy, and Ehrhorn
/ill be extremely hard to fill. Phil
taker and "Red" Targhetta will at- '
empt to take up where the Indian
aptain left off this year. Both are c
xtremely powerful defensive play-
yy. but not very consistent carry
ng the l ball. Both Phil Moffatt and
Spud" Hardy will be gone when
Pop ' Warner starts counting his
•it halfbacks next fall. Kenny Af
