iugliest kind of those breaks, al

e-threat backfield ace and by far

When he played lot I,<> Angel'

nough to make the freshman team

had the fight in him, he went onto
♦ he Grays in his sophomore year
and won his way to a berth on the
varsity the next season. Since then
ho has steadily improved, until now,
even handicapped as he is by the j
injuries that have dogged him lor
almost a year, he is still regarded as
by far the best field general War
ner has, and one of the finest pass
ers and shiftiest ball carriers as well.

in a fashion that would make him
almost certainly the 13endix cog in 1

fatt's first tough break came in
spring practice, when lie broke hi

the summer, and wouldn't have been
such a bother this year, although il
necessitated I'.einj: careful in early
practice and gairu ;. That lie would

how in:.' he made in those contests.
the Minnesota game especially, gain
ing consistently and scoring when a
score was needed.
Oregon Injury
The vindictive fates were not to
let him alone, however. In the Ore
gon State game he was kicked in
Ihc back, and had two vertebrae
injured. At first it was thought
that this injury would be of little
consequence, and that he would be
fully recovered in a week or so.
But it refused to get better, and
hung on from week to week.
But in the week before the Tro
jan contest, hopes were raised again,
for it seemed that the back would
be strong enough to allow Nifty
Phil to general the team against
Howard Jones' warriors. Sports
writers up and down the coast made
much of the fact that if Phil could
run the Indians the Trojan would
have it mighty tough.
Final Blow
Then came the final, crushing
blow—the last cruel gesture of an
already triumphant Devil of 111
Luck. Stanford suporters heard it
like the first, knell of doom almost
as soon as the U.S.C. struggle had
begun: "Moffatt, badly injured,
leaves the game."
Even in that moment the Fate of
Football Players with a wry twist
of irony handed Phancy Phil a small
bit of the glory that was his due—a
tribute to his fighting courage. For
not content with having run back
the opening kickoff 30 yards or so,
he tried to wrench and twist his 156
pounds far enough to the side to
take the ball out of bounds. In do
ing so he tore the ligaments in his
knee free of the bone, making it
almost impossible for him even to
stand.
Nevertheless he still tried to carry
on, but one more play convinced
everyone concerned that there was
nothing to do but remove him from
the game.
