## Series of Hard Breaks Beginning Last Spring Have Kept Card Star From All-American 
### RON KENNEDY 
The breaks of the game—and you
in't moan.
If it weren't for a string of the
iugliest kind of those breaks, al
ost heart-breaking in their suc
\ssion, Stanford's Phil Moffatt, tri
e-threat backfield ace and by far
le brainiest man on the team,
ould right now be making a bid
>r an all-American berth that the
ig shots couldn't afford to over
iok. Even last year, remember, he
as on one news servii • sel' etion.
Pliancy Phil is one of those rare
all players who are pretty good in
igh school and then, instead of
•tting down when they fjH to col
■ge, keep on getting better and bet
>r, ending up in a blaze o* glory in
le last year of intercollegiatcs.
inly Moffatt can't end in a blaze of
lat particular kind of glory now.
nless a miracle occurs.

When he played lot I,<> Angel'
igh, Moffatt was good, but not good
nough to make the freshman team

nere his first year. Bui because he
had the fight in him, he went onto
♦ he Grays in his sophomore year
and won his way to a berth on the
varsity the next season. Since then
ho has steadily improved, until now,
even handicapped as he is by the j
injuries that have dogged him lor
almost a year, he is still regarded as
by far the best field general War
ner has, and one of the finest pass
ers and shiftiest ball carriers as well.
After he had finished lasl season
in a fashion that would make him
almost certainly the 13endix cog in 1
the Big Red Machine th■ . year. Mof
fatt's first tough break came in
spring practice, when lie broke hi
ankle. That healed pretty well over
the summer, and wouldn't have been
such a bother this year, although il
necessitated I'.einj: careful in early
practice and gairu ;. That lie would
not have lo t out on that account
alone is showed by the splendid
how in:.' he made in those contests.
