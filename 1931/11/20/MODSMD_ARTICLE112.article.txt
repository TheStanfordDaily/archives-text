## Herb Forgot The Ball Big Game Theme Song 
### William Rubens 
Everyone from florid politicians to
budding debutantes was at the old
balltteld at Haight and Stanyan thai
March afternoon in 1892. It was a
beyday in San Francisco livcry sta
ble hislory every hansom cah.
buckboard and drayeart had been

hardly enough draught horses to

mightily. So «lid the football teams.

FiiUrn thousand voices aechimed
the teams as they swept on the field.
The stands waited 5, then 10, then
15 minutes. Following a time-hon
ored custom the bleachers began.
They stamped on the boards yelling
at the same time '"Play Ball." Even
the stately society dowagers from
Nob Hill in the boxes ultimately
took up the cry. . . .
Who saved the day no one will
know. But saved it was. Some ob
scure youth undertook to get a foot
ball in that awful crisis. It was
hard going. The city was deserted;
Ihe merchants padlocked their doors
in honor of the day. The saloons,
it was true, were open, but only
cheer in a liquid form was dispensed
from these.
The 15,000 waited and prayed as
the minutes sped by. The band
played through its three-song reper
toire and started all over again. And
then, quite suddenly as is the fash
ion of minor miracles, a small ob
ject was thrown onto the field.
"Play Ball." It was a bad day for
Cal. They lost, 14-10.
