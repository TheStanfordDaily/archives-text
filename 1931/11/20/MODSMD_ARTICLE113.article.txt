Olympic Club in a big upset, (!-()
Their 13-7 victory over the Wa !i

by consistept plav and steady drive
Then they held the splendid Tro

without changing stride, to the tune
of 25-6. Then came the Husky con
flict, which the Bears won, 13-0, and
last week's game with Idaho, won
j 18-0.
Straight Man-Power
In all these games, although bril
liant individual work occasionally
won headlines, the most remarkable
feature has been the straight man
power, the strength in emergencies,
' the FIGHT that those Berkeley men
have proved they have in abun
dance. And they HAVE NOT RE
TRENCHED IN A SINGLE GAME.
Now take the Cardinal season. The
start was what could be well ex
; pected—46-0 over West Coast Army.
(The Olympic Club, always willing
i to fight, finished with the Cards in
1 a 0-0 tic, and Stanford was lucky
lo come off as well as she did.
Then came that contest with the
Broncs. All over the field except in

i that particular part where scores are |
made the Indians were able to mop
j up the field with Santa Clara. But
they scored only once.
In the Minnesota game it looked
j as though Stanford had decided to
make up for lost ground and really
be a Big Red Machine this year. !

a bettcr game than they had the
week before.
Bettcr ilacli Week
And that's just what they havt
been doing cill season—playing bet
ter every week. They look the
Olympic Club in a big upset, (!-()
Their 13-7 victory over the Wa !i
-ington State Cougars was foaturee
by consistept plav and steady drive
Then they held the splendid Tro
jans to a single score—anothcr pi ooi
of steady improvement. In tha'
game thev displayed the best sec
ondary defense exhibited anywhei'
on the coast up to that time. More
improvement. Nevada they took
without changing stride, to the tune
of 25-6. Then came the Husky con
flict, which the Bears won, 13-0, and
last week's game with Idaho, won
j 18-0.
Straight Man-Power
In all these games, although bril
liant individual work occasionally
won headlines, the most remarkable
feature has been the straight man
power, the strength in emergencies,
' the FIGHT that those Berkeley men
have proved they have in abun
dance. And they HAVE NOT RE
TRENCHED IN A SINGLE GAME.
Now take the Cardinal season. The
start was what could be well ex
; pected—46-0 over West Coast Army.
(The Olympic Club, always willing
i to fight, finished with the Cards in
1 a 0-0 tic, and Stanford was lucky
lo come off as well as she did.
Then came that contest with the
Broncs. All over the field except in

i that particular part where scores are |
made the Indians were able to mop
j up the field with Santa Clara. But
they scored only once.
In the Minnesota game it looked
j as though Stanford had decided to
make up for lost ground and really
be a Big Red Machine this year. !
Their 13-0 victory over the Gophers
I was clean and straight, and they

Now that U.C.L.A. contest. Er

Steady vs. Erratic
The "breather" with Nevada gave
the reserves a good workout, as it
had with the Berkeley reserves some ;
weeks before.
But there it is. Steady Bears,
jumpy Indians. Comparative scores
tend to give California a good ad
vantage, but again, California at her i

very best has not been as good as
Stanford at her best.
We know the Bears will be good
Saturday—they'll be better than last
week, or the week before, or the
week before that. The question is
whether or not this erratic up-and
down business is going to put the
Cards at the top on this particular
day. The odds are that it will.
