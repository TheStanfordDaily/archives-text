# Farm Fans, Hungry for Troy Win, See Hope in Hoops
## BASKETBALL NEXT CHANGE OF CARDS TO DOWN TROJANS Coach John Bunn Promises Belter Quintet For Coming Season 
### Stewart Crawford 
A rooting section of a big football ;
game is no place in which to think i
of basketball. Yet it is a cinch that, |
as the hopes of Stanford against i
Troy gradually faded in the gather- j
ing darkness of a gloomy Indian grid j
day down South three weeks ago, !
thoughts of many a weary Cardinal j
turned to the leather casaba, the |
court, and the hoops.
Those terrible Trojans had van
quished Stanford in every major
sport excepting tennis last year, and
this year's first effort at a Redskin
major sports win, gridiron warfare,
had failed to produce an Indian tri- j
umph. Strangely enough, it is not j
even surprising that numerous Stan- :
lordites should look toward the re- I
mainder of the football season with i
something of lethargy, thinking more |
of the time when U.S.C. will again !
.subject itself to a possible defeat by !
Redskin athletes. So it had to be ;
basketball, for then will come at- 1
tempt No. 2 for 1931-32.
Troy Win Possible
John Bunn, the only man with a
right to guess, hints that a series '
win over the southerners on the!
court is not impossible, though com
mon sense hardly dictates anything 1
like even money.
"We'll have a better, smoother ball
club this year," Coach Bunn says, I
"but Southern California will also'
have a better ball club. In fact, S.C.
and California will probably have it i
out for the southern half title, with '
our boys and U.C.L.A. close on their
heels."
Bunn has done a great job here \
at Stanford. He came out of the'
middle west last year to build a j
really feared quintet from the ruins ,
of one which had never even been '
considered a serious threat.
Better Talent Looms
This season John will have more !
and better material, his new system
will be better grounded than before, '
and his pre-season schedule is spot- j
led with tough games which should \
help to whip his team in shape ear- j
lier for the conference opening !
whistle. Then during the confer- J
ence season itself, Bunn has elimi- j
nated all non conference competition, j
allowing his team to prepare more'
effectively for the tilts that effect j
coast standings.
But he is handicapped, like U.C. i
L.A., in that the very nucleus of his ! (
: quad is composed of football play- i
crs, who will not appear on the Pa
vilion floor until around December 1
5, the date they return from the
Dartmouth grid game in the East, i
Neither S. C. nor California is i
bothered with this situation. Luckily |
for them, their hoop stars are not 1
two sport' men, and as a result -
have been able to work out on the \ {
court since the school year began, i v
Moffatt Out? j'
Passing this up as an unavoidable *
difficulty, Bunn will eventually have ;
three of his best five hoopmen of, c
last year, with one heartbreaking i 1
possible exception. That exception t
is Phil Moffatt. Phil is not yet cer- ; £
tain whether he will be able to play,; t
and if he is, he is not sure that he i
ought to tackle it. If he doesn't, t
Stanford will lose its biggest scoring 1
threat, its trickiest forward, and its
greatest competitive athlete. t
Fawcett, who coaches the year
lings this year, will be missed, and j r
Captain Mike Reynolds is through; s
but Rintala, regular guard of last e
year, Reggie Meade and Tom Cor- j s
dry, regular alternating left for- ! e
wards, and Bill Doub, center, will £
all return. ! j
Two Team Plan c
Around this nucleus, Bunn plan.s ' \
to build a team using only men who : s
played under him last year, exclud- !
inc sophomores. Then he plans to c
build another team out of the sopho
mores and new material, thus hav- s
ing two complete fives with their! t
separate substitutes to throw on the 1 1
court, with the second squad not s
notably weaker than the first. That's ' f
what the coach figures on right now,
we repeat, though he may change! t
his mind as he sees how his talent 1 \
is shaping up. ; N
It's not a bad idea, based on the i j
assumption that the boys who played 11
last year know something about !
playing together with his system, j
and those coming up who have two j $
more years will become accustomed I
to the same thing. It is obviously a > 1
.stroke to build for the future.
"New Five" Good ]
In the way of new men, Bunn will \
have plenty. He will have two r
junior transfer guards that have al- 1
ready been heard from on the grid- 1 f
iron, Jay Tod and Al Norgard. Withs
them in the "new" combination!
would be Edclen at guard, and at ! e
center Dave Packard and possibly j I
Keith Topping, a couple of tall soph- 1
omores upon whom a lot of future i'
Stanford basketball rests. r
However, unless Topping is shift- i
od to center, he will fill his regular; s
forward berth, paired with another >
jay see transfer, one Frenchy I/n-sc

-ome, who needs no introduction to
farm faVis.
Looking over the basketball abil
ty packed into this quintet, one
'light bn justified in suspecting that
Bunn'fi "new men"' team will out
shine his "old" one. At any rate, it
wrill be backed by a host «f sterling
>phomore reserves.

to build a team using only men who : s
played under him last year, exclud- !
inc sophomores. Then he plans to c
build another team out of the sopho
mores and new material, thus hav- s
ing two complete fives with their! t
separate substitutes to throw on the 1 1
court, with the second squad not s
notably weaker than the first. That's ' f
what the coach figures on right now,
we repeat, though he may change! t
his mind as he sees how his talent 1 \
is shaping up. ; N
It's not a bad idea, based on the i j
assumption that the boys who played 11
last year know something about !
playing together with his system, j
and those coming up who have two j $
more years will become accustomed I
to the same thing. It is obviously a > 1
.stroke to build for the future.
"New Five" Good ]
In the way of new men, Bunn will \
have plenty. He will have two r
junior transfer guards that have al- 1
ready been heard from on the grid- 1 f
iron, Jay Tod and Al Norgard. Withs
them in the "new" combination!
would be Edclen at guard, and at ! e
center Dave Packard and possibly j I
Keith Topping, a couple of tall soph- 1
omores upon whom a lot of future i'
Stanford basketball rests. r
However, unless Topping is shift- i
od to center, he will fill his regular; s
forward berth, paired with another >
jay see transfer, one Frenchy I/n-sc

-ome, who needs no introduction to
farm faVis.

ty packed into this quintet, one

Troy gradually faded in the gather- j

day down South three weeks ago, !
thoughts of many a weary Cardinal j

court, and the hoops.
Those terrible Trojans had van
quished Stanford in every major
sport excepting tennis last year, and
this year's first effort at a Redskin
major sports win, gridiron warfare,
had failed to produce an Indian tri- j

junior transfer guards that have al- 1

od to center, he will fill his regular; s

A rooting section of a big football ;
game is no place in which to think i
of basketball. Yet it is a cinch that, |
as the hopes of Stanford against i
Troy gradually faded in the gather- j
ing darkness of a gloomy Indian grid j
day down South three weeks ago, !
thoughts of many a weary Cardinal j
turned to the leather casaba, the |
court, and the hoops.
Those terrible Trojans had van
quished Stanford in every major
sport excepting tennis last year, and
this year's first effort at a Redskin
major sports win, gridiron warfare,
had failed to produce an Indian tri- j
umph. Strangely enough, it is not j
even surprising that numerous Stan- :
lordites should look toward the re- I
mainder of the football season with i
something of lethargy, thinking more |
of the time when U.S.C. will again !
.subject itself to a possible defeat by !
Redskin athletes. So it had to be ;
basketball, for then will come at- 1
tempt No. 2 for 1931-32.
Troy Win Possible
John Bunn, the only man with a
right to guess, hints that a series '
win over the southerners on the!
court is not impossible, though com
mon sense hardly dictates anything 1
like even money.
"We'll have a better, smoother ball
club this year," Coach Bunn says, I
"but Southern California will also'
have a better ball club. In fact, S.C.
and California will probably have it i
out for the southern half title, with '
our boys and U.C.L.A. close on their
heels."
Bunn has done a great job here \
at Stanford. He came out of the'
middle west last year to build a j
really feared quintet from the ruins ,
of one which had never even been '
considered a serious threat.
Better Talent Looms
This season John will have more !
and better material, his new system
will be better grounded than before, '
and his pre-season schedule is spot- j
led with tough games which should \
help to whip his team in shape ear- j
lier for the conference opening !
whistle. Then during the confer- J
ence season itself, Bunn has elimi- j
nated all non conference competition, j
allowing his team to prepare more'
effectively for the tilts that effect j
coast standings.
But he is handicapped, like U.C. i
L.A., in that the very nucleus of his ! (

crs, who will not appear on the Pa
vilion floor until around December 1
5, the date they return from the

Neither S. C. nor California is i

Moffatt Out? j'
Passing this up as an unavoidable *
difficulty, Bunn will eventually have ;
three of his best five hoopmen of, c
last year, with one heartbreaking i 1
possible exception. That exception t
is Phil Moffatt. Phil is not yet cer- ; £
tain whether he will be able to play,; t
and if he is, he is not sure that he i
ought to tackle it. If he doesn't, t
Stanford will lose its biggest scoring 1
threat, its trickiest forward, and its
greatest competitive athlete. t
Fawcett, who coaches the year

Captain Mike Reynolds is through; s

Two Team Plan c
Around this nucleus, Bunn plan.s ' \
to build a team using only men who : s
played under him last year, exclud- !
inc sophomores. Then he plans to c
build another team out of the sopho
mores and new material, thus hav- s
ing two complete fives with their! t
separate substitutes to throw on the 1 1
court, with the second squad not s
notably weaker than the first. That's ' f
what the coach figures on right now,
