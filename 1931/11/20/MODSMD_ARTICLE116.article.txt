# STANFORD HOPE TO RETALIATE FOR S.C. DEFEAT RESTS ON VARSITY TRACK SQUAB
## 
### Sheridan Hegland 
• The Cardinal's jaded hopes for de
feating a Southern California team
and making the southland safe for
Stanford are slowly reviving under
the prospect of a brilliant track sea
son.
Forecasts this year show that a
championship really is in the offing
" n r Stanford. While these predic
tions must be discounted as coming
i little too early, there is no doubt
that the Indian squad looks better
low than last year's team did at
:his time. Authority for this is Bill
Ellington, assistant track coach.
And it is to prove this statement
:hat these lists have been compiled.
100-yd. dash—Hec Dyer will be
nissed in this event, but Stanford
should keep its strength in the
dashes. -Jimmy Willson has already
■haded 9.3. Lombardi and Giberson
are improving and should turn in
).7 time. Les Hables, who gained
aointn in the IC4A last spring, may
.•om" up with his best year. He
.vas handicapped by injuries last
season.
220-yd. dash—Same dope 'as the
:entury.
440-yd. dash—"lron-man" Eastman
should crack a few more records
his year; Ike Hables is back; Danny
Murphy, up from the frosh, has
stopped watches at 50 flat. But
Shrove will be missed.
880-yd. dash—Eastman again tops
he list; then Naylon, of whom much
•vas hoped for last year but who
.vas lost to the squad through in
juries, has returned in good condi
tion; Fullenwiedcr is running well.
Mile—Ferris, a transfer, has great
cossibilities; Sam Eastman is being
groomed by Templeton for a 4:20
flash; Avery has shown himself to
be a good prospect.
Two-mile—Aebersold, always re
liable, will be back; Azevedo is a
promising soph; Amdahl, another
man up from the frosh, claims the
honor of winning the first mile run
from Cal in many an Indian moon.
Low hurdles—Smith and Nesbit

| will be sorely missed, but Packard
Brugman, Myers, and Herbert loo?
I good.
j Highs—All that and Wolley anc
j Stallings besides.
Shot—Nellie Grey, George Grey
i and Here Laborde all scored point:
j in last spring's IC4A. but John Ly-
I man, a sophomore, is favored to dis-
I place one of the veterans. Thi.<
I quartet should do their work quite
I handily.
Discus—Bob Jones, Laborde, Nel
!1 ie Grey, Lyman, and Robinson—
| things are looking up.
Javelin—Ray, Ullrnan, Dunn, anc
Brown.
High jump — Blackman, Clyne
Jones, and Jensen, while not won
derful, should register on the score-
I board of any man's track meet.
Pole Vault—De Grooi and Johns
j The boys who know claim that Stan
j ford will surprise in this event.
Relay—Murphy or Sam Eastmar
| will replace Shrove in this year's
j version of a winning relay team. Ber
j Eastman, the two Hables brothers
| and either Sam Eastman or Murphj
' are slated to make up the quartet.
This track team seems bound tc
!go places and do things in a large
i way—that's another way of saying
| that Dean Cromwell looks to be ir
I for some disappointment.
j But just for luck, we'll add the
j words used in the Big Game fore
j cast of last fall—
"It looks like a fine spring, mates.'
