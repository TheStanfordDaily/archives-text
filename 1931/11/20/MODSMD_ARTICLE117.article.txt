Proof of the fact that Hrst, downs
[ and yardage gained do not count in
J the final payoff is evidenced by
i glimpsing the figures of the Stan

played at the Rose Bowl on January
,1, 1925.

ja total gain of 5(5 yards; Stanford
gained Mlfi yards from scrimmage
|and passes, while the Irish made
only 186; Stanford made 17 first

seven, and yet Coach ivockne and
his Four Horsemen won thr game
! by the score of 27-10.
