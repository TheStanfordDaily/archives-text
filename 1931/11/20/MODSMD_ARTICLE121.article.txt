# RACQUETMEN FACE PROMISING SEASON
## Three Additions To Varsity Squad Next Quarter 
### DICk Van Wagenen 
Whereas at first thought the Car- I
dinal racquet possibilities appear far I
less promising than last year, three
important things must be remem
bered in judging the 3932 outfit—
Keith Gledhill, Chuck Weesner, and
Jack Cosgrove.
None of these names is to be found
on the varsity squad at present,
strangely enough, but by the time j
winter quarter roils around, these .
top-notchers will be on hand ready I
to take the courts and help repeat j
last year's clean sweep of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Here is the way they should line
up when things begin to iron out
next quarter. Captain Gledhill, who
is now national intercollegiate cham
pion, will undoubtedly hold onto the
number one position, although, per
haps, intermittently. Next should
come Joe Coughlin, present first
man, then Jack Cosgrove, who
transferred this year from Menlo
Junior College.
After these two have settled their :
arguments, and provided Chuck Otis j
has not already downed Cosgrove, 1
Weesner will fight it out with Otis :
for fourth place. There is even a
chance ( that Bob Forbes will push
Weesner down another rung, with
Kelsey Petterson following close be- j
hind.
All this would account for the first
seven racquet wielders, with Hubert !
Butler, Dan Ellis, and John Gordon
probably scrapping for rankings I
among the first ten. Otis and Ellis, j
who, by the way, are no slouch as j
a doubles combination, are the only j
sophomores in the expected first ten ,
lineup, with Montie Shwayder not
so far down.
Last season's overwhelming sweep
of the Pacific Coast Conference
should be repeated to a lesser de
gree this year if such new additions !
as Cosgrove, Weesner, and Otis, j
none of whom competed last season, |
fulfill expectations. Loss of such ;
men as Captain Ted Easton, Harry
Plymire, Trow Stephens, Phil Nie- j
derauer, and Wilbur Cox, of last 1
season's varsity, will not be easy to :
overcome in any event.
Bruin netsters will undoubtedly -
be Stanford's strongest rival for
southern division honors, which in- \
eludes (J.S.C. and California as well. 1
A high-powered combination such
as Elbert Lewis, last year's Pacific
Coast intercollegiate champion, Jack 1
Tidball, Leonard Dworkin and Cliff
Robbins, will be no cinch, although
last year U.C.L.A. fell before the I
Indian netmen first by a 7-2 score i
and again by a shut-out, 9-0.

Weesner down another rung, with
Kelsey Petterson following close be- j
hind.
All this would account for the first
seven racquet wielders, with Hubert !
Butler, Dan Ellis, and John Gordon
probably scrapping for rankings I
among the first ten. Otis and Ellis, j
who, by the way, are no slouch as j
a doubles combination, are the only j
sophomores in the expected first ten ,
lineup, with Montie Shwayder not
so far down.
Last season's overwhelming sweep
of the Pacific Coast Conference
should be repeated to a lesser de
gree this year if such new additions !
as Cosgrove, Weesner, and Otis, j
none of whom competed last season, |
fulfill expectations. Loss of such ;
men as Captain Ted Easton, Harry
Plymire, Trow Stephens, Phil Nie- j
derauer, and Wilbur Cox, of last 1
season's varsity, will not be easy to :
overcome in any event.
Bruin netsters will undoubtedly -
be Stanford's strongest rival for
southern division honors, which in- \
eludes (J.S.C. and California as well. 1
A high-powered combination such
as Elbert Lewis, last year's Pacific
Coast intercollegiate champion, Jack 1
Tidball, Leonard Dworkin and Cliff
Robbins, will be no cinch, although
last year U.C.L.A. fell before the I
Indian netmen first by a 7-2 score i
and again by a shut-out, 9-0.
The students of the University of
Illinois are trying to gef an outdoor
swimming pool.
Whereas at first thought the Car- I
dinal racquet possibilities appear far I
less promising than last year, three
important things must be remem
bered in judging the 3932 outfit—
Keith Gledhill, Chuck Weesner, and
Jack Cosgrove.
None of these names is to be found
on the varsity squad at present,
strangely enough, but by the time j
winter quarter roils around, these .
top-notchers will be on hand ready I
to take the courts and help repeat j
last year's clean sweep of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Here is the way they should line
up when things begin to iron out
next quarter. Captain Gledhill, who
is now national intercollegiate cham
pion, will undoubtedly hold onto the
number one position, although, per
haps, intermittently. Next should
come Joe Coughlin, present first
man, then Jack Cosgrove, who
transferred this year from Menlo
Junior College.
After these two have settled their :
arguments, and provided Chuck Otis j
has not already downed Cosgrove, 1
Weesner will fight it out with Otis :
for fourth place. There is even a
chance ( that Bob Forbes will push
Weesner down another rung, with
Kelsey Petterson following close be- j
hind.
