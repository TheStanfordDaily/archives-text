# PROSPECT FOR RETAINING COAST BALL CROWN LOOMS BRIGHT AS COACH GRINS
## 
### Howard Moore 
While all the olher athietic mo-, sacker judging from his work this
guls around the campus are moan
ing of lost veterans, screaming of
injuries, groaning of lack of mate
rial, and deploring thises and thats,
Coach Wolter just grins all to him
self down in the dug-outs of the lo
cal ball orchard.
Stanford's veteran baseball mentor
pulled a Connie Mack last year to
win Stanford's first title since the
establishment of the California Base
ball Association five years ago, only
Wolter did McGillicuddy the Great
one better—what Connie did with
two pitchers Wolter did with one.
With six of the nine veterans of
last year back again and several
good prospects out for the grand old
pastime, chances seem exceedingly
in the vermillion that Stanford will
finish this season again in cop
money.
Leading the list of returning let
termen are Rudy Rintala and Gordy
Campbell. Alter competing in foot
ball, basketball, track, intramural
horseshoes, interfraternity parchesi
and several other things, the "Roo
sian" will ambie out to center field
this spring. The big Finn batted sec
ond in the conference last year with
.420 and should be great this year.
Campbell, a consistent hitter as well
as the owner of the best pegging arm
around these parts, will return to
right field as soon as Warner's foot
ball season ends.
Left Field Vacant
In the other pasture, left vacant by
the graduation of Captain Johnny
Hunken, may be almost anyone,
Newton Goldmann being the leading
contender for the post. Other out
field aspirants include Jim Irsfeld,
Dick Mi les, and Ray Forsythe.
Moving in to the infield, we find
Fred Goodell, Emile "Frenchy" La
Combe, and Art Hearn clustered
around first base, left vacant by the
graduation of Spud Hardy. Goodell
v/as a regular a couple of years ago,
but was not registered last spring.
The Frenchman is heralded as great
stuff on a basis of his work at Menlo
last. year, while Hearn was guar
dian of the fust sack for last year's
yearling outfit.
Vince Philippi is the returning let
tel man at second, being pressed by
one Martin Gabriel, protégé of Spud
Harder of Bakersfield Jaysee and
owner of no mean record as a ball
player. Philippi is cavorting about
the diamond now, while Gabriel is
one of Warner's multitude at pres
ent. Howard Hall is a likely second

; fall.
Bert Delmas has a clear call on
i the short patch unless some one
I bobs up with the abiiity of a Charlie
I Gelbert or a Joe Cronin. Delmus
| captained the '33 aggregation as
i shortstop and played in the same
i position all last year as a varsity
| regular, btsides being one of three
! in the conference to bat above .400.
Third Base Is Problem
Third base presents Wolter's big
problem. Dykes Johnson, probably
i the prettiest player on the whole
\ squad last year, has graduated to
1 leave a huge gap in the hot corner.
! Bob Maentz of last year's babe
' squad, Al Bogan, who possesses a
! fine pegging arm, and the stocking-
I less Bill Triplett are the mam con
' tenders for the post at present. Wise
j boys professing to be in on the
| know, however, insist that Wolter
j will eventually place Gabriel at
| third, leaving Philippi at the key
j stone sack.
The only other apparent weak spot
on the team is behind the plate. Ike
Livermore, letterma not' last year is
back again, but is none too experi
enced. Joe Fessio, catcher of the
'31 freshman nine, is back again
after three years and may well take
over the receiving duties. Jim Mas
sey of the '34 team and Bob Schauf,
a transfer from Redlands, are the
men out for the job. The angular
Livermore may be shifted to third,
intimated the Card skipper.
Pitching Staff Good
But it's the pitching "staff" that
causes "Connie" Wolter to smile.
Last year the Indian maestro had
one mnger, Dan Johnson, and John
son picked off nine conference vic
tories in ten starts. He also pitched
and won all three games of the an
nual series against the Bears; the
first time the trick has been done
since 1893.
Johnson is on the slab right now,
but Wolter has another ace up his
sleeve. The Earnshaw of this com
bination is Stan "Moose" Anderson,
powerful right-hander of last year's
freshman pack who piled up the en
viable record of 102 strike-outs in
66 innings pitched. Apparently An
derson will not be used by Warner
on the gridiron this year which is
all right with Wolter. One less man
with a battered arm, grins the Car
dinal mentor.
Bob Savinske and Bill Stark are
among the moundsmcn out for fall
practice, while Ernie Caddel will
probably appear for duty after the
football season draws to a close.

Campbell. Alter competing in foot
ball, basketball, track, intramural
horseshoes, interfraternity parchesi
and several other things, the "Roo
sian" will ambie out to center field
this spring. The big Finn batted sec
ond in the conference last year with
.420 and should be great this year.
Campbell, a consistent hitter as well
as the owner of the best pegging arm
around these parts, will return to
right field as soon as Warner's foot
ball season ends.
Left Field Vacant
In the other pasture, left vacant by
the graduation of Captain Johnny
Hunken, may be almost anyone,
Newton Goldmann being the leading
contender for the post. Other out
field aspirants include Jim Irsfeld,
Dick Mi les, and Ray Forsythe.
Moving in to the infield, we find
Fred Goodell, Emile "Frenchy" La
Combe, and Art Hearn clustered
around first base, left vacant by the
graduation of Spud Hardy. Goodell
v/as a regular a couple of years ago,
but was not registered last spring.
The Frenchman is heralded as great
stuff on a basis of his work at Menlo
last. year, while Hearn was guar
dian of the fust sack for last year's
yearling outfit.
Vince Philippi is the returning let
tel man at second, being pressed by
one Martin Gabriel, protégé of Spud
Harder of Bakersfield Jaysee and
owner of no mean record as a ball
player. Philippi is cavorting about
the diamond now, while Gabriel is
one of Warner's multitude at pres
ent. Howard Hall is a likely second

; fall.
Bert Delmas has a clear call on
i the short patch unless some one
I bobs up with the abiiity of a Charlie
I Gelbert or a Joe Cronin. Delmus
| captained the '33 aggregation as
i shortstop and played in the same
i position all last year as a varsity
| regular, btsides being one of three
! in the conference to bat above .400.
Third Base Is Problem
Third base presents Wolter's big
problem. Dykes Johnson, probably
i the prettiest player on the whole
\ squad last year, has graduated to
1 leave a huge gap in the hot corner.
! Bob Maentz of last year's babe
' squad, Al Bogan, who possesses a
! fine pegging arm, and the stocking-
I less Bill Triplett are the mam con
' tenders for the post at present. Wise
j boys professing to be in on the
| know, however, insist that Wolter
j will eventually place Gabriel at
| third, leaving Philippi at the key
j stone sack.
The only other apparent weak spot
on the team is behind the plate. Ike
Livermore, letterma not' last year is
back again, but is none too experi
enced. Joe Fessio, catcher of the
'31 freshman nine, is back again
after three years and may well take
over the receiving duties. Jim Mas
sey of the '34 team and Bob Schauf,
a transfer from Redlands, are the
men out for the job. The angular
Livermore may be shifted to third,
intimated the Card skipper.
Pitching Staff Good
But it's the pitching "staff" that
causes "Connie" Wolter to smile.
Last year the Indian maestro had
one mnger, Dan Johnson, and John
son picked off nine conference vic
tories in ten starts. He also pitched
and won all three games of the an
nual series against the Bears; the
first time the trick has been done
since 1893.
Johnson is on the slab right now,
but Wolter has another ace up his
sleeve. The Earnshaw of this com
bination is Stan "Moose" Anderson,
powerful right-hander of last year's
freshman pack who piled up the en
viable record of 102 strike-outs in
66 innings pitched. Apparently An
derson will not be used by Warner
on the gridiron this year which is
all right with Wolter. One less man
with a battered arm, grins the Car
dinal mentor.
Bob Savinske and Bill Stark are
among the moundsmcn out for fall
practice, while Ernie Caddel will
probably appear for duty after the
football season draws to a close.
While all the olher athietic mo-, sacker judging from his work this
guls around the campus are moan
ing of lost veterans, screaming of
injuries, groaning of lack of mate
rial, and deploring thises and thats,
Coach Wolter just grins all to him
self down in the dug-outs of the lo
cal ball orchard.
Stanford's veteran baseball mentor
pulled a Connie Mack last year to
win Stanford's first title since the
establishment of the California Base
ball Association five years ago, only
Wolter did McGillicuddy the Great
one better—what Connie did with
two pitchers Wolter did with one.
With six of the nine veterans of
last year back again and several
good prospects out for the grand old
pastime, chances seem exceedingly
in the vermillion that Stanford will
finish this season again in cop
money.

| third, leaving Philippi at the key
j stone sack.
The only other apparent weak spot
on the team is behind the plate. Ike
Livermore, letterma not' last year is
back again, but is none too experi
enced. Joe Fessio, catcher of the
'31 freshman nine, is back again
after three years and may well take
over the receiving duties. Jim Mas
sey of the '34 team and Bob Schauf,
a transfer from Redlands, are the
men out for the job. The angular
Livermore may be shifted to third,
intimated the Card skipper.
Pitching Staff Good
But it's the pitching "staff" that
causes "Connie" Wolter to smile.
Last year the Indian maestro had
one mnger, Dan Johnson, and John
son picked off nine conference vic
tories in ten starts. He also pitched
and won all three games of the an
nual series against the Bears; the
first time the trick has been done
since 1893.
Johnson is on the slab right now,
but Wolter has another ace up his
sleeve. The Earnshaw of this com
bination is Stan "Moose" Anderson,
powerful right-hander of last year's
freshman pack who piled up the en
viable record of 102 strike-outs in
66 innings pitched. Apparently An
derson will not be used by Warner
on the gridiron this year which is
all right with Wolter. One less man
with a battered arm, grins the Car
dinal mentor.
Bob Savinske and Bill Stark are
among the moundsmcn out for fall
practice, while Ernie Caddel will
probably appear for duty after the
football season draws to a close.

While all the olher athietic mo-, sacker judging from his work this
guls around the campus are moan
ing of lost veterans, screaming of
injuries, groaning of lack of mate
rial, and deploring thises and thats,
Coach Wolter just grins all to him
self down in the dug-outs of the lo
cal ball orchard.
Stanford's veteran baseball mentor
pulled a Connie Mack last year to
win Stanford's first title since the
establishment of the California Base
ball Association five years ago, only
Wolter did McGillicuddy the Great
one better—what Connie did with
two pitchers Wolter did with one.
With six of the nine veterans of
last year back again and several
good prospects out for the grand old
pastime, chances seem exceedingly
in the vermillion that Stanford will
finish this season again in cop
money.
Leading the list of returning let
termen are Rudy Rintala and Gordy
Campbell. Alter competing in foot
ball, basketball, track, intramural
horseshoes, interfraternity parchesi
and several other things, the "Roo
sian" will ambie out to center field
this spring. The big Finn batted sec
ond in the conference last year with
.420 and should be great this year.
Campbell, a consistent hitter as well
as the owner of the best pegging arm
around these parts, will return to
right field as soon as Warner's foot
ball season ends.
Left Field Vacant
In the other pasture, left vacant by
the graduation of Captain Johnny
Hunken, may be almost anyone,
Newton Goldmann being the leading
contender for the post. Other out
field aspirants include Jim Irsfeld,
Dick Mi les, and Ray Forsythe.
Moving in to the infield, we find
Fred Goodell, Emile "Frenchy" La
Combe, and Art Hearn clustered
around first base, left vacant by the
graduation of Spud Hardy. Goodell
v/as a regular a couple of years ago,
but was not registered last spring.
The Frenchman is heralded as great
stuff on a basis of his work at Menlo
last. year, while Hearn was guar
dian of the fust sack for last year's
yearling outfit.
Vince Philippi is the returning let
tel man at second, being pressed by
one Martin Gabriel, protégé of Spud
Harder of Bakersfield Jaysee and
owner of no mean record as a ball
player. Philippi is cavorting about
the diamond now, while Gabriel is
one of Warner's multitude at pres
ent. Howard Hall is a likely second

; fall.
Bert Delmas has a clear call on
i the short patch unless some one
I bobs up with the abiiity of a Charlie
I Gelbert or a Joe Cronin. Delmus
| captained the '33 aggregation as
i shortstop and played in the same
i position all last year as a varsity
| regular, btsides being one of three
! in the conference to bat above .400.
Third Base Is Problem
Third base presents Wolter's big
problem. Dykes Johnson, probably
i the prettiest player on the whole
\ squad last year, has graduated to
1 leave a huge gap in the hot corner.
! Bob Maentz of last year's babe
' squad, Al Bogan, who possesses a
! fine pegging arm, and the stocking-
I less Bill Triplett are the mam con
' tenders for the post at present. Wise
j boys professing to be in on the
| know, however, insist that Wolter
j will eventually place Gabriel at
| third, leaving Philippi at the key
j stone sack.
