# INDIAN GOLFERS SHOW ABILITY
## 
### 
Stanford's golf team this year
should be one of the strongest in the
history of Cardinal divot-digging.
Although Captain McNaughton, Ed
munds, and Goldwuter are lost from
last year's outfit through graduation,
enough men are returning from the
1931 varsity and freshman squads to
form a well-balanced team.
Charlie Seaver, will probably play
play number one man. Captain
Harry Eichelberger is at present
ranked second, and is followed by
Lawson Little. Little, like Seaver,
is known as one of the best amateur
golfers in the country.
Two members of last year's team,
Harry Hellman and Stuart Hawley,
are fourth and fifth in the present
rankings. Jerry Trautman recently
won the sixth position from Jim Rea,
who is now seventh on the list. Dick
Hoag, Gene Brown, and Dave May
complete the varsity team.
Fortunately, the squad is largely
composed of sophomores.
