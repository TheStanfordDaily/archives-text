# BLEACHER YARDSTICK SHOWS BIG GAINS officials to Supply Hot Air Heating System in Stadium TICKETS WOULD REACH TO NEXT S.C. GAME

FIGURES ARE always handy;
at it seems to us that if the entire
idian first string was laid out head
-feet just before the kick-off to
orrow that it wop Id be just the
eak the Blue and Gold has been
•oking for.
AND SPEAKING of statistics—
icctators will gorge themselves on
4,267 1-4 yards of hot
jgs, fresh from the local puppy
junds; enough peanuts to give the
itire stadium a nice coating of but
•r if the occasion arises; cigarettes
id cigars to the extent of furnish
ig the Cal rooters with their cher
hed desire to see the Big Game
mfire burned twice; and those who
lew gum will probably waste their
me too.
GOING DEEPER into the subject,
e find that the dear old eighteenth
nendment to something or other
lat runs this country and its un
nown number of clauses are to be
iolated by approximately 3-5 of the
lectators, who will consume 1-5
ich. Figure that one out. Of course
ic liquors will be assorted—some
ere and some there, mostly in be
veen.
IT HAS been reported that 13,000
ints of soft 'drinks will be drunk
ud a like number of spectators also,
pecial agents will render castor oil,
luto, or what have you during
mes-out. The more times you're
ut the better.
A LITTLE over 40 special trains
f twelve coaches each and 19,310
utomobiles will take spectators to
le game and carry them home . . .
ventually.

FOUR THOUSAND hooters . . .
rooters ... or something . . . will
yell themselves through four bottles
of Blisterine each, will contort them
selves into G8,971 different and va
ried positions, wil tear 15,000 cards
into about 137,528 1-2 pieces which
j will go twice as many places, and
1 will climax the day by singing pa
triotic songs and serpentining over
I the field. We don't know just yet
, which section will do this, however.
Aunt Emma has promised to tell us
i tonight.
AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER
of officials, referees, visiting profes
sor:;, thirsty gentlemen, etc., will ex
pend all efforts to supply the best
i self-heating system the stadium has
ever seen. Hot air is to be the fuel
j supply. Blast furnaces are to be
used.
THE ENTIRE population of Cali
fornia will spend the greater part of
j tonight wondering about the game
' tomorrow and several people down
jin Hollywood arc wondering what
I the score is already.
IT HAS BEEN reported that if all
j the tickets for the game were placed
end to end they would reach almost
i eight miles, and if this were added
' to all the seats in the stadium lined
up for a distance of some thirty
| miles we would reach almost down
ito the Angelic City and the S.C.
game next year.
IN CONCLUSION, we think that
i if more STUDENTS stayed home to-
I morrow night we could go out and
! have a better time and still step on
| less feet. And if anyone plays a
' bunch of Blue and Gold songs, why
'we MIGHT even sing 'em! We DO

yell themselves through four bottles
of Blisterine each, will contort them
selves into G8,971 different and va
ried positions, wil tear 15,000 cards
into about 137,528 1-2 pieces which
j will go twice as many places, and
1 will climax the day by singing pa
triotic songs and serpentining over
I the field. We don't know just yet
, which section will do this, however.
Aunt Emma has promised to tell us
i tonight.
AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER
of officials, referees, visiting profes
sor:;, thirsty gentlemen, etc., will ex
pend all efforts to supply the best
i self-heating system the stadium has
ever seen. Hot air is to be the fuel
j supply. Blast furnaces are to be
used.
THE ENTIRE population of Cali
fornia will spend the greater part of
j tonight wondering about the game
' tomorrow and several people down
jin Hollywood arc wondering what
I the score is already.
IT HAS BEEN reported that if all
j the tickets for the game were placed
end to end they would reach almost
i eight miles, and if this were added
' to all the seats in the stadium lined
up for a distance of some thirty
| miles we would reach almost down
ito the Angelic City and the S.C.
game next year.
IN CONCLUSION, we think that
i if more STUDENTS stayed home to-
I morrow night we could go out and
! have a better time and still step on
| less feet. And if anyone plays a
' bunch of Blue and Gold songs, why
'we MIGHT even sing 'em! We DO
FIGURES ARE always handy;
at it seems to us that if the entire
idian first string was laid out head
-feet just before the kick-off to
orrow that it wop Id be just the
eak the Blue and Gold has been
•oking for.
AND SPEAKING of statistics—
icctators will gorge themselves on
4,267 1-4 yards of hot
jgs, fresh from the local puppy
junds; enough peanuts to give the
itire stadium a nice coating of but
•r if the occasion arises; cigarettes
id cigars to the extent of furnish
ig the Cal rooters with their cher
hed desire to see the Big Game
mfire burned twice; and those who
lew gum will probably waste their
me too.
GOING DEEPER into the subject,
e find that the dear old eighteenth
nendment to something or other
lat runs this country and its un
nown number of clauses are to be
iolated by approximately 3-5 of the
lectators, who will consume 1-5
ich. Figure that one out. Of course
ic liquors will be assorted—some
ere and some there, mostly in be
veen.
IT HAS been reported that 13,000
ints of soft 'drinks will be drunk
ud a like number of spectators also,
pecial agents will render castor oil,
luto, or what have you during
mes-out. The more times you're
ut the better.
A LITTLE over 40 special trains
f twelve coaches each and 19,310
