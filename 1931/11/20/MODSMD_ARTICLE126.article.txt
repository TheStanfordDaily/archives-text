# ELLINGTON SEES HOPE FOR BALANCED YEARLING TRACK SQUAD IN 1931 SEASON
## 
### 
Basing his statement on the prob- ]
bility that his frosh track team will
resent a better balanced aggrega
on than last year's squad, which
efeated the Berkeley Cubs by three
oints, Coach Ellington has let it be
nown that he has a real team in
ne ofTing.
'34's formidable outfit was cap
oned by Dave Packard, led by
'ackard, and built around Packard,
/ith some useful help from Lyman, '
leier, Azevedo, Burch and Amdahl.
This year, eight men already stand
ut in their respective events, and
hey should form the nucleus of a
/ell balanced squad. The team's i
reatest strength will probably lie
1 the long-distance races, where i
'hi 1 Morentin and Dave Devlin
ught to place one-two in both the i
lile and two mile runs. However,
I is doubtful whether they will be'
equircd to circle the oval twelve j
imes in an afternoon except for the 1
jittle Big Meet.
Morentin is well known all over j
he state for having won the Cali- 1
ornia Interscholastic mile chain- ■
uonship two years in a row. More |
ccently he won the intramural
ross-country run in rccord-brcak
ng time.
Devlin, a Middle-We.stcrn'er, has

] been out of school for a year, but
before his vacation he turned the
half-mile for Culver Military Acad
emy in 2:2:3.
Also from the Middle-West is
John Beatty, javelin tosser. In high
school he tossed the spear 172 feet.
A1 Blackman, whose presence at
this university changes the Stanford
Brothers' Quartet of Track to a sex
tet (the Hables, the Eastmans, and
the Blackmans), appears to have the
potentialtiies of a truly great
j sprinter.
The high-jump and pole-vault
will be handled by Schween and
Rothert. Schween is from Salinas,
and jumped 6 feet 1 inch to win the
north coast meet last year. Rothert,
brother of Harlow, vaulted 12 feet in
i high school.
The last of the eight arc Lawrence
Lapidus, with 21 feet 6 inches in the
broad-jump, and Russ Munro, who
i has run the low hurdles in 24:2.
| The weight men are inexperienced
and the prospects in the shot-put
I and discus arc indefinite. Lettunich
I and Van Kirk should develop and
; Doug Mann is also a possibility in
| the discus.
Weakest of all the events are the
middle distances, as no one has
shown any marked ability in either
the 440 or the 880 to date.

jittle Big Meet.
Morentin is well known all over j
he state for having won the Cali- 1
ornia Interscholastic mile chain- ■
uonship two years in a row. More |
ccently he won the intramural
ross-country run in rccord-brcak
ng time.
Devlin, a Middle-We.stcrn'er, has

] been out of school for a year, but
before his vacation he turned the
half-mile for Culver Military Acad
emy in 2:2:3.
Also from the Middle-West is
John Beatty, javelin tosser. In high
school he tossed the spear 172 feet.
A1 Blackman, whose presence at
this university changes the Stanford
Brothers' Quartet of Track to a sex
tet (the Hables, the Eastmans, and
the Blackmans), appears to have the
potentialtiies of a truly great
j sprinter.
The high-jump and pole-vault
will be handled by Schween and
Rothert. Schween is from Salinas,
and jumped 6 feet 1 inch to win the
north coast meet last year. Rothert,
brother of Harlow, vaulted 12 feet in
i high school.
The last of the eight arc Lawrence
Lapidus, with 21 feet 6 inches in the
broad-jump, and Russ Munro, who
i has run the low hurdles in 24:2.
| The weight men are inexperienced
and the prospects in the shot-put
I and discus arc indefinite. Lettunich
I and Van Kirk should develop and
; Doug Mann is also a possibility in
| the discus.
Weakest of all the events are the
middle distances, as no one has
shown any marked ability in either
the 440 or the 880 to date.
Basing his statement on the prob- ]
bility that his frosh track team will
resent a better balanced aggrega
on than last year's squad, which
efeated the Berkeley Cubs by three
oints, Coach Ellington has let it be
nown that he has a real team in
ne ofTing.
'34's formidable outfit was cap
oned by Dave Packard, led by
'ackard, and built around Packard,
/ith some useful help from Lyman, '
leier, Azevedo, Burch and Amdahl.
This year, eight men already stand
ut in their respective events, and
hey should form the nucleus of a
/ell balanced squad. The team's i
reatest strength will probably lie
1 the long-distance races, where i
'hi 1 Morentin and Dave Devlin
ught to place one-two in both the i
lile and two mile runs. However,
I is doubtful whether they will be'
equircd to circle the oval twelve j
imes in an afternoon except for the 1
jittle Big Meet.
