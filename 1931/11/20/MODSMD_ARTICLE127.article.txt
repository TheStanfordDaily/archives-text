in his four lengths in 53.4 for the
relay team; and John McKclvey,
who came within 7-10 of the Na
tional Intercollegiate 100-yard mark
recently, when he shaded Gardner's
Pacific Coast time, unofficially.
Fighting for the place left by the
graduation of "Whitey" Burns, last
year's backstroke star, are Harris,
Simons, McGavern, Clark and Mc-

j Intercollegiate diving ace, and Des
! Jardines, Olympic champion, are
j Herb Marsh, Bill Campbell, and
George Frazer.
Stanford's water polo team, undc-

| competition, will be even more pow
jcrful than usual, with Booth, Clapp,
and Wiget as forwards; Woods, Har

| and Bill Rogers, who recently fin
j ished third to Arthur Hargraves of
the Olympic Club and Captain Booth

i stroke race. Rogers has come within
I 1.7 seconds of Booth's record al

' usually undefeated, has a strong for
ward-line in Triolo, Booth, and Ben
jet or Friedman. The guard positions
: are being hotly contested by Fara
