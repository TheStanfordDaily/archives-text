# TRAINER DENNY HAS LOCAL RECORD FOR SPEEDY TENNIS WIN
## 
### 
Wallace Denny, the versatile
trainer of Stanford football teams
and the man who is responsible for
sending many a poor "cripple" onto
the gridiron in condition to play his
best game, is quite an athlete him
self. He has participated successful
ly in practically every sport, al
though he does draw the line at
golf. Denny claims the campus rec
ord for the most decisive victory
ever made in a Stanford tennis
match. He beat one embryo racket
star, who once had aspirations of
some day making the varsity, 6-0 in
exactly 9 minutes. The set was litâ€”
, erally played on the run.
Electric lights have been installed
in Centerville, Texas. This town has
, existed eighty years without them.
