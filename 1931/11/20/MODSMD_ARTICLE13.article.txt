! show our appreciation by turning
i out en masse," said Marion Hew

managing the afi'air. "It is part of
! the agreement that, he play at a
Stanford rally, so we are holding
1 this special one for his benefit." '
It was largely through the efforts j
; of Griff Williams, Stanford alumnus
J and now pianist in the Weeks band
' that arrangements for the dance
i were completed.
