# STANFORD INDIANS HOLD EDGE IN BIG GAME ENCOUNTERS
## Big Red Machine Wins 17 Tilts; Cal Chalks Up 12 Victories 
### 
Alter tomorrow the thirty-seventh
meeting of Stanford and California
will be just another score in the long
line of grid results for the Big Game,
football classic of the west.
Since 1892, date of the first meet
ing of the two, the annual game has
been the most looked for contest
played during the year and remains
the Big Game irrespective of the
seasonal records of the two partici
pants. When 200,000 fans clamor for
seats available for approximately
90,000, the game "has to be good."
In seventeen of the thirty-six
games Stanford has attained the
coveted winner's circle. California
has made that spot twelve times
with ties chalked up for seven of
the contests. Rugby football saw the
Cardinals as victors in five of ihe
nine games with one tie and Cali
fornia winner three tjmes. Twenty
seven meetings of American football
left Stanford as winner in twelve of
the games, California as conqueror
in nine of the battles and six tie
contests.
Since "Pop" Warner first took over
the reins of coaching the Redskins
in 1924, Stanford has won four of
the six games with the other two as
ties. In both tie games California
was the favorite and last minute
come-backs of the Cards evened the
scoring column. Again California is
favored in this grid classic of the
west, but Pop Warner is still with
the Cards, so local dopesters haven't
given up the ship yet.
