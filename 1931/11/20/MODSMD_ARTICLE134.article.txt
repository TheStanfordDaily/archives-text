# MAN TO MAM COMPARISON OF TEAMS GIVES REDSHIRTS, REARS EVEN CHANCE
## 
### Beecher Kellogg 
When Navy Bill Ingram leads his
(California Golden Bears down to the
'Farm tomorrow, he is going to be
j met by a reception committee in the
form of Pop Warner and eleven
lighting Indians. Just what the out
come of this meeting will be is un
-1 certain but it is certain that there
will be plenty of fur and feathers
i flying.
Judging by a man-to-man com
i parison of the two squads, neither
| the Golden Bears nor the Stanford
| Redshirts look to have much of an
i edge. Juggle the dope to suit your
j self.
The Ends
With Tod out of the lineup, the
! Cards lose their best wing men. Col-
I vin will be the best pass receiver on
! the turf and also has ability in cov
j ering punts. Stone, for the Bears,
' is rated a fine all around player,
while Di Resta and Degnan run him
a close second. Little Pete Di Resta
I may not get into the game tomor
i row because of an injury he ran
| into in the Washington game. Neil,
j one of the Farm boys, hasn't played
i up to last year's form though he
still has plenty of lire left. Doub
I and Clark haven't seen much ser
' vice this season but look good in
practice. Waterbury and Kaufman
have been in the fray when Cali
j fornia was concerned.
The Tackles
I The tackle positions seem to be
; about a toss-up with Hand and Er-
I horn being given the edge by Stan
ford supporters, while Ransome and
Tozier holds the cards as far as Cal
j rooters go. Gribbin and Grey have
'played a little ball for Stanford,
: while Coombs and Williams have
! moved from one squad to another
pretty regularly over at Berkeley.
Hand and Erhorn are both big and
| can take care of themselves in any
j company.
The Guards
Corbus stands out in this position
both on offense and dclense while
! Carlson from across the bay shows
I nice defensive ball when paired with
| Ranscme. McArthur has turned in
lone or two good games this season
I as have Gill and Pascoe. Dawson,
Hulen, and Bigelow all have had
their share of playing experience at
j Stanford, though none of them h;v e
stood out at this period of the sea
: son.
The Centers
Medanich for Cal started slowly
this season and has not shown his
| real ability so far. On the other
i hand, Milligan of the Redshirts, has
played consistent ball throughout
the season and is a steady passer.
, Marks, Bates, and McLeoa play
nearly on a par though Marks usu
ally get the substitution call. Bald
win and Hanson haven't played
much so far for ihe Bears and their
calibre is rather an unknown qunl-
! ity -
The Halfbacks
MofTatt, triple threat man for the
j Cards, is by far the fanciest hall
packer on either squad although in
| juries have hampered him this sea -
! son. Gill, All-American candidate,
j is the most valuable halfback on the
Cal squad. His fierce aggressiveness
and fine line backing put him in the

] front. Schaldach is the Bear triplo
threat man and a good drop kicker.
He has been kept on the bench by
< injuries. Valianos is a nicc kicker
though many of his boots are too
j low for the enda to cover.
Watkins and Captain Griffiths
! haven't played much this year. Af
ilc) l augh has been groomed to fill
i Moffatt's shoes should Phil not be
S able to start or is hurt. A nice open
j field runner and safety man. Lam-
I bert and Campbell are good men in
I the open field though not so good
| on defense. Rintala will probably
be the first substitution in this posi
tion unless Pop shifts him to full.
! A poor passer.
The Fullbacks
Allen looks like about the cream
of the crop because of his passing
ability and speed in ball carrying.
Castro and Keefer play under the
Blue and Gold colors though neither
have shown anything spectacular to
date. Caddel shows nice line smash
ing ability and looks pretty good on
defense. Stanford seems to have the
j edge in this department,
j The Quarterbacks
Captain Hillman leads the stock
: of quarterbacks and will be about
I the best line plunger on the field, if
in strijje. His line backing ability is
| not quite up to that of Targhctta,
I though he shows more on offense.
The Bears have Smith, Kirwin, and
' Stewart to fill this position though
rone 01 them have looked so hot
' this year. Smith will probably start.
Both varsities this season have
, been troubled with injuries and
! whether Stanford or California will
1 be able to show their full strength
will depend mainly on the ability of
i the trainers.

j Stanford, though none of them h;v e
stood out at this period of the sea
: son.
The Centers
Medanich for Cal started slowly
this season and has not shown his
| real ability so far. On the other
i hand, Milligan of the Redshirts, has
played consistent ball throughout
the season and is a steady passer.
, Marks, Bates, and McLeoa play
nearly on a par though Marks usu
ally get the substitution call. Bald
win and Hanson haven't played
much so far for ihe Bears and their
calibre is rather an unknown qunl-
! ity -
The Halfbacks
MofTatt, triple threat man for the
j Cards, is by far the fanciest hall
packer on either squad although in
| juries have hampered him this sea -
! son. Gill, All-American candidate,
j is the most valuable halfback on the
Cal squad. His fierce aggressiveness
and fine line backing put him in the

] front. Schaldach is the Bear triplo
threat man and a good drop kicker.
He has been kept on the bench by
< injuries. Valianos is a nicc kicker
though many of his boots are too
j low for the enda to cover.
Watkins and Captain Griffiths
! haven't played much this year. Af
ilc) l augh has been groomed to fill
i Moffatt's shoes should Phil not be
S able to start or is hurt. A nice open
j field runner and safety man. Lam-
I bert and Campbell are good men in
I the open field though not so good
| on defense. Rintala will probably
be the first substitution in this posi
tion unless Pop shifts him to full.
! A poor passer.
The Fullbacks
Allen looks like about the cream
of the crop because of his passing
ability and speed in ball carrying.
Castro and Keefer play under the
Blue and Gold colors though neither
have shown anything spectacular to
date. Caddel shows nice line smash
ing ability and looks pretty good on
defense. Stanford seems to have the
j edge in this department,
j The Quarterbacks
Captain Hillman leads the stock
: of quarterbacks and will be about
I the best line plunger on the field, if
in strijje. His line backing ability is
| not quite up to that of Targhctta,
I though he shows more on offense.
The Bears have Smith, Kirwin, and
' Stewart to fill this position though
rone 01 them have looked so hot
' this year. Smith will probably start.
Both varsities this season have
, been troubled with injuries and
! whether Stanford or California will
1 be able to show their full strength
will depend mainly on the ability of
i the trainers.
When Navy Bill Ingram leads his
(California Golden Bears down to the
'Farm tomorrow, he is going to be
j met by a reception committee in the
form of Pop Warner and eleven
lighting Indians. Just what the out
come of this meeting will be is un
-1 certain but it is certain that there
will be plenty of fur and feathers
i flying.
Judging by a man-to-man com
i parison of the two squads, neither
| the Golden Bears nor the Stanford
| Redshirts look to have much of an
i edge. Juggle the dope to suit your
j self.
The Ends
With Tod out of the lineup, the
! Cards lose their best wing men. Col-
I vin will be the best pass receiver on
! the turf and also has ability in cov
j ering punts. Stone, for the Bears,
' is rated a fine all around player,
while Di Resta and Degnan run him
a close second. Little Pete Di Resta
I may not get into the game tomor
i row because of an injury he ran
| into in the Washington game. Neil,
j one of the Farm boys, hasn't played
i up to last year's form though he
still has plenty of lire left. Doub
I and Clark haven't seen much ser
' vice this season but look good in
practice. Waterbury and Kaufman
have been in the fray when Cali
j fornia was concerned.
The Tackles
I The tackle positions seem to be
; about a toss-up with Hand and Er-
I horn being given the edge by Stan
ford supporters, while Ransome and
Tozier holds the cards as far as Cal
j rooters go. Gribbin and Grey have
'played a little ball for Stanford,
: while Coombs and Williams have
! moved from one squad to another
pretty regularly over at Berkeley.
Hand and Erhorn are both big and
| can take care of themselves in any
j company.
The Guards
Corbus stands out in this position
both on offense and dclense while
! Carlson from across the bay shows
I nice defensive ball when paired with
| Ranscme. McArthur has turned in
lone or two good games this season
I as have Gill and Pascoe. Dawson,

The Bears have Smith, Kirwin, and
' Stewart to fill this position though
rone 01 them have looked so hot
' this year. Smith will probably start.
Both varsities this season have
, been troubled with injuries and
! whether Stanford or California will
1 be able to show their full strength
will depend mainly on the ability of
i the trainers.
When Navy Bill Ingram leads his
(California Golden Bears down to the
'Farm tomorrow, he is going to be
j met by a reception committee in the
form of Pop Warner and eleven
lighting Indians. Just what the out
come of this meeting will be is un
-1 certain but it is certain that there
will be plenty of fur and feathers
i flying.
Judging by a man-to-man com
i parison of the two squads, neither
| the Golden Bears nor the Stanford
| Redshirts look to have much of an
i edge. Juggle the dope to suit your
j self.
The Ends
With Tod out of the lineup, the
! Cards lose their best wing men. Col-
I vin will be the best pass receiver on
! the turf and also has ability in cov
j ering punts. Stone, for the Bears,
' is rated a fine all around player,
while Di Resta and Degnan run him
a close second. Little Pete Di Resta
I may not get into the game tomor
i row because of an injury he ran
| into in the Washington game. Neil,
j one of the Farm boys, hasn't played
i up to last year's form though he
still has plenty of lire left. Doub
I and Clark haven't seen much ser
' vice this season but look good in
practice. Waterbury and Kaufman
have been in the fray when Cali
j fornia was concerned.
The Tackles
I The tackle positions seem to be
; about a toss-up with Hand and Er-
I horn being given the edge by Stan
ford supporters, while Ransome and
Tozier holds the cards as far as Cal
j rooters go. Gribbin and Grey have
'played a little ball for Stanford,
: while Coombs and Williams have
! moved from one squad to another
pretty regularly over at Berkeley.
Hand and Erhorn are both big and
| can take care of themselves in any
j company.
The Guards
Corbus stands out in this position
both on offense and dclense while
! Carlson from across the bay shows
I nice defensive ball when paired with
| Ranscme. McArthur has turned in
lone or two good games this season
I as have Gill and Pascoe. Dawson,
Hulen, and Bigelow all have had
their share of playing experience at
j Stanford, though none of them h;v e
stood out at this period of the sea
: son.
The Centers
Medanich for Cal started slowly
this season and has not shown his
| real ability so far. On the other
i hand, Milligan of the Redshirts, has
played consistent ball throughout
the season and is a steady passer.
, Marks, Bates, and McLeoa play
nearly on a par though Marks usu
ally get the substitution call. Bald
win and Hanson haven't played
much so far for ihe Bears and their
calibre is rather an unknown qunl-
! ity -
The Halfbacks
MofTatt, triple threat man for the
j Cards, is by far the fanciest hall
packer on either squad although in
| juries have hampered him this sea -
! son. Gill, All-American candidate,
j is the most valuable halfback on the
Cal squad. His fierce aggressiveness
and fine line backing put him in the

] front. Schaldach is the Bear triplo
threat man and a good drop kicker.
He has been kept on the bench by
< injuries. Valianos is a nicc kicker
though many of his boots are too
j low for the enda to cover.
Watkins and Captain Griffiths
! haven't played much this year. Af
ilc) l augh has been groomed to fill
i Moffatt's shoes should Phil not be
S able to start or is hurt. A nice open
j field runner and safety man. Lam-
I bert and Campbell are good men in
I the open field though not so good
| on defense. Rintala will probably
be the first substitution in this posi
tion unless Pop shifts him to full.
! A poor passer.
The Fullbacks
Allen looks like about the cream
of the crop because of his passing
ability and speed in ball carrying.
Castro and Keefer play under the
Blue and Gold colors though neither
have shown anything spectacular to
date. Caddel shows nice line smash
ing ability and looks pretty good on
defense. Stanford seems to have the
j edge in this department,
j The Quarterbacks
Captain Hillman leads the stock
: of quarterbacks and will be about
I the best line plunger on the field, if
in strijje. His line backing ability is
| not quite up to that of Targhctta,
I though he shows more on offense.
