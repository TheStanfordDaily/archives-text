Our mission was
what radio and pu

ing that during
the constant action of the Iray no
time is left for contemplation on
anything but sixty minutes of foot
ball. Every minute is sixty seconds
crammed with fight, flash and the
problem of where the little oval is
going on the next play.
These three gentlemen will re
port the Big Game tomorrow to the
audiences in the stadium and those
scattered throughout the cuontry.
Don Liebendorfer's situation, al
though fundamentally the same as
those of the radio men, differs great
ly in that he, through the amplifiers
in the stadium, is there to supple
ment the information which the
spectator already has received via
his own eyes.
"A public address announcer,"'
says Liebendorfer, "should be like
an official—as inconspicuous as pos
sible. The radio broadcast is tem
pered with color in the voice of the
announcer, but my problem is to see
that my voice betrays not the slight
est emotion. Being a Stanford man,
this is a difficult task."
All three men agree upon the
point that a radio announcer must
be more careful than the sports
writer; he must not editorialize ox
inject his personal comment into -the
broadcast. Their task before the
season gets under way is to memo
lize the name and number of every
player and substitute on the teams
that they will report during the sea
son.
Ernie Smith, in acquainting him
self with the gridders, spends two
days a week during the season at
both Stanford and California, study
ing the idiosyncrasies of posture of
individuals. This enables him to
recognize players running back
punts, intercepted passes, etc., when
the numbers are not visible.
Saturday's game will be Thomp

son's 18th broadcast this season. Last
year he made 22. This year his 22nd
will be at the Rose Bowl in the an
nual southern East-West classic.
Smith's statement that the offen
sive team always gets the break in
Ihe announcing because of the ball
carrying is ironically brought out in
Ihe following bit. Last year, after
the Big Game broadcast, Ernie re
ceived about 250 letters from Cal
fans branding him as a "Stanford
partisan.' It is interesting to note
that he is a Cal graduate in the class
of '17.
Popular opinion seems to poin»
that the bctween-the-halve«-> time is
the hardest on the radio announcer,
who must find something to enter
tain the scattered audience. Don
Liebendorfer is not confronted with
this problem.
It is interesting to note that Lie
bendorfer is alone in the use of field
communication and that he avails
himself of this only to get the names
of the defensive tacklers on each
play. Each radio announcer and the
public address man computes the
yardage himself, recognizes the ball
carriers, and determines penalties by
the yardage.
The announcers all summarize, in
reviewing a day's work, that they
are reporters—not experts. An im
partial comment, devoid of anything
personal, is the aim of your servant
of the air.

It is interesting to note that Lie
bendorfer is alone in the use of field
communication and that he avails
himself of this only to get the names
of the defensive tacklers on each

the yardage.

Our mission was
what radio and pu

ing that during
the constant action of the Iray no
time is left for contemplation on
anything but sixty minutes of foot
ball. Every minute is sixty seconds
crammed with fight, flash and the
problem of where the little oval is
going on the next play.
These three gentlemen will re
port the Big Game tomorrow to the
audiences in the stadium and those
scattered throughout the cuontry.
Don Liebendorfer's situation, al
though fundamentally the same as
those of the radio men, differs great
ly in that he, through the amplifiers
in the stadium, is there to supple
ment the information which the
spectator already has received via
his own eyes.
"A public address announcer,"'
says Liebendorfer, "should be like
an official—as inconspicuous as pos
sible. The radio broadcast is tem
pered with color in the voice of the
announcer, but my problem is to see
that my voice betrays not the slight
est emotion. Being a Stanford man,
this is a difficult task."
All three men agree upon the
point that a radio announcer must
be more careful than the sports
writer; he must not editorialize ox
inject his personal comment into -the
broadcast. Their task before the
season gets under way is to memo
lize the name and number of every
player and substitute on the teams
that they will report during the sea
son.
Ernie Smith, in acquainting him
self with the gridders, spends two
days a week during the season at
both Stanford and California, study
ing the idiosyncrasies of posture of
individuals. This enables him to
recognize players running back
punts, intercepted passes, etc., when
the numbers are not visible.
Saturday's game will be Thomp

son's 18th broadcast this season. Last
year he made 22. This year his 22nd
will be at the Rose Bowl in the an
nual southern East-West classic.
Smith's statement that the offen
sive team always gets the break in
Ihe announcing because of the ball
carrying is ironically brought out in
Ihe following bit. Last year, after
the Big Game broadcast, Ernie re
ceived about 250 letters from Cal
fans branding him as a "Stanford
partisan.' It is interesting to note
that he is a Cal graduate in the class
of '17.
Popular opinion seems to poin»
that the bctween-the-halve«-> time is
the hardest on the radio announcer,
who must find something to enter
tain the scattered audience. Don
Liebendorfer is not confronted with
this problem.
