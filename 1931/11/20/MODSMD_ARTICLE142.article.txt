After reporting a game, football j
radio announcers declare they can ;
remember very few specific facts |
about the play. They may recollect '<
whether a game was good or bad,
but over a period of years it is dif- i
ficult for them to recall when or ,
how an important game was played. !
Announcers have competed that
seven out of every ten listeners !
keep football charts and keep track |
of substitutions religiously. This
makes it even more important that j
reports of contests be accurate.
