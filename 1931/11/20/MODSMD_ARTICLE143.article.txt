Billy McLaine, varsity baseball
pitcher for four years and captain
of the baseball team in '9G, has the
distinction of being the owner of the
first Stanford Block "S." His let
ter was an imitation of a Yale "Y"
worn by "Pop" Bliss, who was foot
ball captain at the time.
The original red sweater with its
white letter is now displayed in the
Encina Gym trophy room.
