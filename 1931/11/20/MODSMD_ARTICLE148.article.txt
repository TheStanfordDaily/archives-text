# Quartet Of Stellar Indians, And One Important Bear
## Schaldach The Passer Holds Down The Top Corner, While Ehrhorn, Alien, Afflerbaugh, and Hand Gather 'Round 
### 

l mil rt'SY /: 11' 11111 i
HANK SCH ALDACH, flashy California left halfback, v.'ho will
start the game tomorrow. Schaldach recently returned to the Golden
Beai lineup alter being Jept on the bench for several weeks by a
broken wrist. His return to form gave California stock a big boost,
as he is not only a brilliant cpen-field runner, but is the big gun of
the Bear parsing attack. Had Hank been able to play against U.S.C.
to add an aeriel threat to the attack of the Bill Ingram eleven, a
different score might have been written into the record books.
Schaldach, who plays with a heavy leather brace on his injured
wrist, will be relieved tomorrow by George Watkins, another left
half who has been handicapped by injuries this season, and by Lee
Valianos. Watiins, whose chief asset is his kicking, is not counted
on for much service, because of a small foot bone fractured during
the Trojan cncoanter. Valianos, however, has been developing
rapidly, and Ingram finds his vital left halt position v/ell fortified
for the big feit in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
i

DUSTY ALLEN, on the pro
pelling end of that Allen to
Calvin scoring machine. Dusty's
long and beautiful spirals have
c onnecicd for several last
minute scores, one of which
pulled the U.C.L.A. game out of the fire after all
Rope had been abandoned. Accuracy is Ailen's
password, not only in tossing the pigskin, hut also
in packing it, the pose in which you see him above.
For Dusty can find holes, if they're there.


KENNY AFFLERBAUGH,„
■:hifty substitute halfback, who
started the season with hardly
a prayer conceded him to break
into the big money. But he had
different ideas about it all, and
as a result found himself on
the doorstep of Ernie Caddel's
right half p )'iition after the
Husky name. But Moffatt was
hurt, so it was Kenny's fate to
become a left half. Watch him
do some fancy booting tomor
row.


RED HAND, who filled in for George Grey at left tackle when
the latter was injured in early season, and \/ho now has he come so
fond of the position he doesn't want to give it up. During the absence
of Grey, Hand so pleased Pop Warne: with his fighting performances
that he made the redhead a regular. Hand opened against Southern
California, and will he on the field tomorrow afternoon when the
tarting whistle blows.
Grey, however, is expected to see much service in a relief role
in the Bear encounter. He is doubly valuable because of his kicking,
both on kickoffs and on place kicks {or extra point after touchdown.
It was a tough break for George when he received a bad knee in
an early game.
Hand and Grey will be opposed by Toiier, up-and-coming Cali
fornia tackle, in the Big fracas tomorrow. To/ier is a scrappy young
penflrman who is harrl to cut out of a nlav.


THE BIG RED MACHINE springs Affierbaugk loose, opening a wide hole in
the left side of the Oregon State line. The picture v/as snapped just as Kenny ,vas
crossing the 30-yard line on his famous 88-yard jc.unt. From where you now see him.

he cut to the right, crossing up the Beaver secondary men, and proceeded toward
the end zone at a speed that denied a host of Orange and Black persuers. Until
the last half of the final quarter, that score was the margin of the Indian lead.


CHUCK EHRHORN, Pop Warner's huge tackle, is the wearer
of that No. 7 you have seen so prominent in plays directed against
the right side of the Indian forward wall this season, He will
vtart in tomorrow's came.

RED HAND, who filled in for George Grey at left tackle when
the latter was injured in early season, and \/ho now has he come so
fond of the position he doesn't want to give it up. During the absence
of Grey, Hand so pleased Pop Warne: with his fighting performances
that he made the redhead a regular. Hand opened against Southern
California, and will he on the field tomorrow afternoon when the
tarting whistle blows.
Grey, however, is expected to see much service in a relief role
in the Bear encounter. He is doubly valuable because of his kicking,
both on kickoffs and on place kicks {or extra point after touchdown.
It was a tough break for George when he received a bad knee in
an early game.
Hand and Grey will be opposed by Toiier, up-and-coming Cali
fornia tackle, in the Big fracas tomorrow. To/ier is a scrappy young
penflrman who is harrl to cut out of a nlav.

he cut to the right, crossing up the Beaver secondary men, and proceeded toward
the end zone at a speed that denied a host of Orange and Black persuers. Until
the last half of the final quarter, that score was the margin of the Indian lead.

HANK SCH ALDACH, flashy California left halfback, v.'ho will
start the game tomorrow. Schaldach recently returned to the Golden
Beai lineup alter being Jept on the bench for several weeks by a
broken wrist. His return to form gave California stock a big boost,
as he is not only a brilliant cpen-field runner, but is the big gun of
the Bear parsing attack. Had Hank been able to play against U.S.C.
to add an aeriel threat to the attack of the Bill Ingram eleven, a
different score might have been written into the record books.
Schaldach, who plays with a heavy leather brace on his injured
wrist, will be relieved tomorrow by George Watkins, another left
half who has been handicapped by injuries this season, and by Lee
Valianos. Watiins, whose chief asset is his kicking, is not counted
on for much service, because of a small foot bone fractured during
the Trojan cncoanter. Valianos, however, has been developing
rapidly, and Ingram finds his vital left halt position v/ell fortified
for the big feit in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
