# STANFORD WOMEN LOSE Imports Win Grid Captains "500" FAIL TO CHARM
## 
### 
Can it be true that the women of
this institution are pills?
If figures do not lie, Stanford
maidens may well read this and
weep: Of the 42 Cardinal football
captains, only seven have married
Stanford women, and four of those
seven graduated before the Univer
sity was 10 years old. The last eight
captains have remained untouched
by the charms of their classmates.
C. L. Clemans of the '92 team was
the first to marry a co-ed, followed
in order by G. H. Cochran, '96, For
rest S. Fisher '98, F.W. Burnett of
| the 1900 team, Charles F. Doe, Jr.,
i captain in '18, Art Wilcox, captain in
1 '20, and Dudley S. DeGroot, captain
! in '22.
What does all this prove? Did
I Stanford women have more IT in
) the days before they had to fight to
j enter? Does the brawn of the foot
( ball captains lessen their interest in
| brain in the so-called weaker sex?
Or can it be that Stanford women
don't want to marry Stanford foot
| ball captains?
