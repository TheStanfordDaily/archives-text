# California Has Good Chance To Break Card Jinx
## Warner Has Never Lost a Game During His Reign at Stanford; Cardinals Have Gone Undefpated Since 1923 But Are Unknown Quantity BEAR TEAM ENTERS BIG GAME AS FAVORITE Aerial Attack Questioned Since Rintala Is To Start At Fullback Instead of Allen 
### 
By LOWELL COX
gTANFORD at a peak. California at a peak. Stanford FIGHTING to
maintain a record of no defeats since li>2.'i. California FIGHTING to
blast that record clear out of Stanford Stadium. The game a toss-up.
That will he the picture tomorrow afternoon as the Indian Reds and
(he Golden Bears clash in the thirty-seventh annual Bif Game. "Toss-up"
is as optimistic a word as Stanford partisans can apply to the classic. An
edge, if any exists, must he given to California. Only because of iiie
jinx Pop Warner has held over the Boars since his first classic encounter

•'with California, the 20 to 20 tie of
15)24, can the Indians be given an
even break.
"Navy Bill" Ingram, receiving his
Big Game initiation, will climax his
first season of building tomorrow, a
season which has seen the rise of
I the Boar eleven from scratch to the
position of a powerful contender.
After showing steady improvement
j every week since their opening tilt,
I the Californians will be at the peak
of their game.
INDIANS TOFNOTCH
Pop Warner, who has yet to taste
[ defeat in a Big Game, is expected to
have his charges at the peak they
! always have reached for the Cali
| fornia classic. The Indians should
I rise to their greatest heights of the
!season.
If Stanford wins tomorrow, it will
i be because of the Old Fox's trickery,
t Greater manpower, a stronger line,
; and a fighting defense against run
] ning plays all favor California.
But the Bear has shown signs
that he can be fooled. Southern
! California fooled him and collected
a touchdown to defeat the Bruin in
one of his most savage moods. El
Trojan used a typical Warner ro
| verse to make that score.
CAL AERIAL DEFENSE
The Bear has been fooled on
passes, too, Stanford's greatest of
fensive threat. Ingram has accom
plished much since early season and
the California aerial defense will
certainly be lighter than it was
against St. Mary's, but it may not
be tight enough.
If Stanford's passing attack should
be stopped, it might be disastrous.
The outstanding defect of the Big
Red Machine this year has been it.-,
inability to penetrate the opposi
tion's defense on running play in
' side the 10-yard line. Even against
j little Nevada the Indians were
forced to take to the air 1o score
all but one of their four touch
downs ,all hough piling up yardage
almost at will in the center of the
field.
NO PASSES?
| Just what Warner has in mind
for tomorrow is a question. It was
thought the Old Man would rely
heavily on passes, until his an
nouncement Wednesday nipht that
Rintala, instead of Allen, would
start at fullback.
Since Rintala is a faster ball
carrier than Allen and completely
1 foxed the Trojans two weeks ago on
a revived hidden-ball play, an early
, running attack featured by ihe
"nth" degree of deception may be
in order. Rintala can also throw
passes of the very long variety, but
is not as accurate as Allen.
ALLEN MAY START
On the other hand, it is still pos
sible that Allen will be in the lineup
at the starting whistle, as the Old
Man is noted for his last-minute
changes of announced lineups.
Latest news from the rival camps
shows little change in injury lists.
For Stanford, Tod is definitely out.
Moffatt is given a chance to play
for a short time, but little is ex
pected from him.
For California, Castro is IN,
Schaldach is IN, Stone is IN, but
may not start, Gill is IN, and only
Wat kins is doubtful. Like Moffatt,
Watkins is given a chance to play,
but is not being counted on.
IDEAL WEATHER
The weather man gave the In
dians a break when he announced
"ideal football weather for Satur
day. There is no snow or rain in
sight for that day, and the sun
should shine, while the temperature
should be just crisp enough to make
conditions ideal."
A fast field is essential to the
perfect functioning of the Warner
attack, while the Bears have played
their best games this year on slow
fields.
Clear skies, two fighting football
teams, and two seasons to be made

Pop Warner, who has yet to taste
[ defeat in a Big Game, is expected to
have his charges at the peak they
! always have reached for the Cali
| fornia classic. The Indians should
I rise to their greatest heights of the
!season.
If Stanford wins tomorrow, it will
i be because of the Old Fox's trickery,
t Greater manpower, a stronger line,
; and a fighting defense against run
] ning plays all favor California.
But the Bear has shown signs
that he can be fooled. Southern
! California fooled him and collected
a touchdown to defeat the Bruin in
one of his most savage moods. El
Trojan used a typical Warner ro
| verse to make that score.
CAL AERIAL DEFENSE
The Bear has been fooled on
passes, too, Stanford's greatest of
fensive threat. Ingram has accom
plished much since early season and
the California aerial defense will
certainly be lighter than it was
against St. Mary's, but it may not
be tight enough.
If Stanford's passing attack should
be stopped, it might be disastrous.
The outstanding defect of the Big
Red Machine this year has been it.-,
inability to penetrate the opposi
tion's defense on running play in
' side the 10-yard line. Even against
j little Nevada the Indians were
forced to take to the air 1o score
all but one of their four touch
downs ,all hough piling up yardage
almost at will in the center of the
field.
NO PASSES?
| Just what Warner has in mind
for tomorrow is a question. It was
thought the Old Man would rely
heavily on passes, until his an
nouncement Wednesday nipht that
Rintala, instead of Allen, would
start at fullback.
Since Rintala is a faster ball
carrier than Allen and completely
1 foxed the Trojans two weeks ago on
a revived hidden-ball play, an early
, running attack featured by ihe
"nth" degree of deception may be
in order. Rintala can also throw
passes of the very long variety, but
is not as accurate as Allen.
ALLEN MAY START
On the other hand, it is still pos
sible that Allen will be in the lineup
at the starting whistle, as the Old
Man is noted for his last-minute
changes of announced lineups.
Latest news from the rival camps
shows little change in injury lists.
For Stanford, Tod is definitely out.
Moffatt is given a chance to play
for a short time, but little is ex
pected from him.
For California, Castro is IN,
Schaldach is IN, Stone is IN, but
may not start, Gill is IN, and only
Wat kins is doubtful. Like Moffatt,
Watkins is given a chance to play,
but is not being counted on.

have his charges at the peak they
! always have reached for the Cali
| fornia classic. The Indians should
I rise to their greatest heights of the
!season.
If Stanford wins tomorrow, it will
i be because of the Old Fox's trickery,
t Greater manpower, a stronger line,
; and a fighting defense against run
] ning plays all favor California.
But the Bear has shown signs
that he can be fooled. Southern
! California fooled him and collected
a touchdown to defeat the Bruin in
one of his most savage moods. El
Trojan used a typical Warner ro
| verse to make that score.
CAL AERIAL DEFENSE
The Bear has been fooled on
passes, too, Stanford's greatest of
fensive threat. Ingram has accom
plished much since early season and
the California aerial defense will
certainly be lighter than it was
against St. Mary's, but it may not
be tight enough.
If Stanford's passing attack should
be stopped, it might be disastrous.
The outstanding defect of the Big
Red Machine this year has been it.-,
inability to penetrate the opposi
tion's defense on running play in
' side the 10-yard line. Even against
j little Nevada the Indians were
forced to take to the air 1o score
all but one of their four touch
downs ,all hough piling up yardage
almost at will in the center of the
field.
NO PASSES?
| Just what Warner has in mind
for tomorrow is a question. It was
thought the Old Man would rely
heavily on passes, until his an
nouncement Wednesday nipht that
Rintala, instead of Allen, would
start at fullback.
Since Rintala is a faster ball
carrier than Allen and completely
1 foxed the Trojans two weeks ago on
a revived hidden-ball play, an early
, running attack featured by ihe
"nth" degree of deception may be
in order. Rintala can also throw
passes of the very long variety, but
is not as accurate as Allen.
ALLEN MAY START
On the other hand, it is still pos
sible that Allen will be in the lineup
at the starting whistle, as the Old
Man is noted for his last-minute
changes of announced lineups.
Latest news from the rival camps
shows little change in injury lists.
For Stanford, Tod is definitely out.
Moffatt is given a chance to play
for a short time, but little is ex
pected from him.
For California, Castro is IN,
Schaldach is IN, Stone is IN, but
may not start, Gill is IN, and only
Wat kins is doubtful. Like Moffatt,
Watkins is given a chance to play,
but is not being counted on.
IDEAL WEATHER
The weather man gave the In
dians a break when he announced
"ideal football weather for Satur
day. There is no snow or rain in
sight for that day, and the sun
should shine, while the temperature
should be just crisp enough to make
conditions ideal."
A fast field is essential to the
perfect functioning of the Warner
attack, while the Bears have played
their best games this year on slow
fields.
Clear skies, two fighting football
teams, and two seasons to be made
or broken—it looks like the greatest
Big Game since 1924,
