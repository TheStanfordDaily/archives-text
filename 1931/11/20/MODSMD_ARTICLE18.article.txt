# ONCE AGAIN THE CARDINAL
## 
### 
Down from the Berkeley hills tomorrow afternoon
sweeps a rejuvenated Golden Rear, an Ingram-trained
Golden Rear, a cocky Golden Rear. For the second time
since Glenn Warner took over the Stanford coaching reins,
;i California team will enter the Rig Game favored to win.
Two years ago, a California eleven that had upset
Southern California alter the Trojans had trounced Stan
ford came to the Farm one raw November afternoon chesty
and full of confidence. The Indians had just taken a sur
prise licking from Santa Clara and were on the short end
of 10 to 7 wagering.
Stanford was mad and Stanford rose to the heights to
simply outclass the Rlue and Gold in one of the greatest
Rig Game upsets in history. Stanford fought and won. If
Stanford fights tomorrow, the Cardinal will again triumph.;
The 1931 team has been keyed for just one game to date;
the Trojan contest. There they were outmanned. To
morrow they will not be outmanned. Tomorrow they must
tight.
If Stanford fights—and Stanford teams have always
fought then tomorrow afternoon every Stanford man can
lustily proclaim that "Once again the Cardinal has whip-,
ped the Gold and Rlue."
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTION
In its overzealous attempts to regulate the conduct of I
the women by forbidding them to work ;il Ihe bonfire,
Women's Council not only went against the wishes of the
majority but also assumed powers not delegated to it by;
the A.S.S.U. constitution.
Concerning the powers of the Women's Conference, the j
constitution in article 1 under associated women students
says:
"The President of the University herebv delegates to the!
r>
Women's Student Conference the power to LEGISLATE
in matters relating to the conduct of women students of the
I niversity."
In article 2, section 1, the constitution defines the pow-j
ers of the Women's Council as follows:
"The Council shall enforce the EXISTING rules and reg
ulations relating to such conduct and such amendments or,
additions to those regulations as may be hereafter RECOM
MENDED by the Conference ami approved bv the Presi
dent."
The Council had absolutely no power or right to pro
hibit the women from working on the bonfire, such action;
lying in the province of the Women's Conference to legis
late upon such a matter.
Through its control of late leaves, the Council might
prevent leaves being taken for bonfire work, but it over-j
stepped its Constitutional bounds in preventing the women
from serving to the freshmen workers up until 10:,'50 o'clock
at night.
An attempt was made to call a meeting of Women's
Conference on Friday, six days before the bonfire was
burned, but it was unsuccessful. No further attempt to get
Conference action on the matter was made after that date.
The Council assumed the powers to legislate on the matter, I
claiming that there was not enough time to call «m Confer-!
ence meeting.
This whole problem brings to light an obvious defect
in the Constitution. An amendment should be passed at
the next general election clearly forbidding Women's
Council from usurping the powers of the Women's Confer-!
ence or assuming any other powers not specificially granted
it bv the Constitution.
