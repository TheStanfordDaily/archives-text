## 
### 
All women who expect to sit jn
the rooting section at the Big Game i
tomorrow and who have not. already
purchased pom-pons should get .
them today in the A.S.S.U. office, '
Ed Boyles, Rally Committee chair
man, announced last night. He de
clared that it is just as important j
for the women to have the pom
pons as it is for the men to have
rooters' hats. A thousand hydrogen ,
balloons will also be distributed to !
the women at the game, he said. '
A thorough, check of tickets will
be made at the Stadium gates to- '
morrow, Boyles declared. Admis

slightest doubt as to validity of the j
