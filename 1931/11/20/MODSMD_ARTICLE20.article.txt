# BULL SESSION
## "AND ON YOUR RIGHT . . . .” 
### 
The Big Game Rally was 0.K.,
BUT .... it brought to the atten
tion of the student body the lurid
l'act that they are only incidental
parts around this campus. The Pa
vilion was jammed, to be sure—
jammed to the rafters with Paly
High heroes, the grammar school,
prides of the village, fat dowagers,
startled infants, some off-campus
smoothies with their girl-friends—
and to be sure some Stanford stu
dents were also there—playing their
part in the grand sideshow for the
benefit of the visitors.
The crisis came when a member
of the Rally Committee and a
worker for the B.A.C. asked us to
give up our seats for some paid
customers. Having just recovered
from an acute attack of general
rigidity of the muscles from having
warmed the Pavilon floor during the
U.S.C. rally, and this being our last
Big Game Rally, and wishing to see
what was going on as well as being
a part of it, we refused and kept
our seats.
The attendant seemed surprised,
and not a little offended, that a
mere college student should pre
sume to wish a decent seat when
many outsiders paid 25 cents to
witness the spectacle. It seemed
strange that an individual who paid
$99 to become a member of this
University—and $9 of which goes
to make him a member of the stu
dent body should attempt to take a
seat from one who had turned over
one quarter of a dollar; and whose
interest in the situation was the
same as that of the lady and her
children at the circus.

Now if a few alumni wish to re
| visit the scenes of their collegehood,
that is probably fine; but that the
scene of our rally should be over
run with a mass of curious indi
viduals and their small children out
lo be entertained, is, indeed, a
j strange situation. College football
: men have become spectacles for the
; nation, but does that mean that the
i whole student body has to go on
display for the sake of the mob? A
, rally should be a private affair in
! which to let off some personal
steam; and gather additional en-
J thusiasm for a game. It should never
j be a show for visitors.
j Of course, people are interested
|in college students, and of course
i the B.A.C. wants to make money,
so why not organize general sight
i seeing tours throughout the campus
i —for the lowans—both those that
i come from that state and those that
■ happen to hail from other places?
| A tour through Encina would prob
j ably be very profitable. Perhaps the
! B.A.C. could induce the frosh to
j stage typical and hyper-typical
! water-bag and hen-fruit fights for
I the visitors—much in the manner
| that the tourist companies used to
J arrange "long wars" for Chinatown
\ visitors. But we all would have to
,do our part. Varsity dragging on
j the quad, ukeleles for every stu
' dent, tap dancing between classes,
: and harmony quartets on every
corner would be indispensable if
the Outlanders are to get their
I money's worth.
If we don't call a halt, this Uni
j versity will become a great three
| l ing circus and sideshow combined,

interest in the situation was the
same as that of the lady and her
children at the circus.

Now if a few alumni wish to re
| visit the scenes of their collegehood,
that is probably fine; but that the
scene of our rally should be over
run with a mass of curious indi
viduals and their small children out
lo be entertained, is, indeed, a
j strange situation. College football
: men have become spectacles for the
; nation, but does that mean that the
i whole student body has to go on
display for the sake of the mob? A
, rally should be a private affair in
! which to let off some personal
steam; and gather additional en-
J thusiasm for a game. It should never
j be a show for visitors.
j Of course, people are interested
|in college students, and of course
i the B.A.C. wants to make money,
so why not organize general sight
i seeing tours throughout the campus
i —for the lowans—both those that
i come from that state and those that
■ happen to hail from other places?
| A tour through Encina would prob
j ably be very profitable. Perhaps the
! B.A.C. could induce the frosh to
j stage typical and hyper-typical
! water-bag and hen-fruit fights for
I the visitors—much in the manner
| that the tourist companies used to
J arrange "long wars" for Chinatown
\ visitors. But we all would have to
,do our part. Varsity dragging on
j the quad, ukeleles for every stu
' dent, tap dancing between classes,
: and harmony quartets on every
corner would be indispensable if
the Outlanders are to get their
I money's worth.
If we don't call a halt, this Uni
j versity will become a great three

The Big Game Rally was 0.K.,
BUT .... it brought to the atten
tion of the student body the lurid
l'act that they are only incidental
parts around this campus. The Pa
vilion was jammed, to be sure—
jammed to the rafters with Paly
High heroes, the grammar school,
prides of the village, fat dowagers,
startled infants, some off-campus
smoothies with their girl-friends—
and to be sure some Stanford stu
dents were also there—playing their
part in the grand sideshow for the
benefit of the visitors.
The crisis came when a member
of the Rally Committee and a
worker for the B.A.C. asked us to
give up our seats for some paid
customers. Having just recovered
from an acute attack of general
rigidity of the muscles from having
warmed the Pavilon floor during the
U.S.C. rally, and this being our last
Big Game Rally, and wishing to see
what was going on as well as being
a part of it, we refused and kept
our seats.
The attendant seemed surprised,
and not a little offended, that a
mere college student should pre
sume to wish a decent seat when
many outsiders paid 25 cents to
witness the spectacle. It seemed
strange that an individual who paid
$99 to become a member of this
University—and $9 of which goes
to make him a member of the stu
dent body should attempt to take a
seat from one who had turned over
one quarter of a dollar; and whose
interest in the situation was the
same as that of the lady and her
children at the circus.
