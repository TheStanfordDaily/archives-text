life is just a bowl of cherries fel
lows and too many cooks spoil the
broth anyhow we have buttered our
bread and now we must lie in it the
idea being that we have eaten big
game drunk big game dreamed big
game for a week or so and you
know all about it too but theres
nothing else to be said about any
| thing
the japanese versus Chinese
| question might he aired of
| course but we're interested in
engineering and politics simply
dont ring a bell in the colyums..
! . .brain how are you getting along
with your cook this season
! incidentally theres a thing com
: monly known as the ramshead gaie
| ties this evening and if you cant got
a ticket drop in by aeroplane or
; something cartwright pays us to
tell you that his numbers are the
j hest on the program we imagine so
too go and hear lum sing about san
I francisco sadie then see him after
j the show and bribe him for ihe
I original version we laugh
this jollyup affair this after
noon is probably the biggest
win in history hear anson weeks
for merely a snap of your finger
i as you walk in the door and try

and remember liow it sounded
tomorrow night when you try
to approach him in his native
haunt youd be astounded at the
difference arch iha Id really
frosh and bonfire committee alike
are still looking a trifle bleary eyed
as a result of their five nights vigil
everybody thinks theyre all pretty
swell anyhow and the women did
their best even if they got cheated
out of serving food and twenty
three fraternities forgot red cross
drives and everything else to buy
donuts for the starving mob and
anyway we thank you and this con
stitutes our weekly bouquet and we
feel better
as for the big game itself
enough is said everywhere else
in this mornings paper all we
can do is keep on looking for
odds because we need energy to
get in practice for the serpen
tine ami every little nickle helps
what we mean is the game is no
where near to being on ice but
we hope hard anyway at the
end of the fourth quarter will
be early enough to moan if
things go wrong and personally
we expect to shout instead
heaven bless you all and a
merry Christmas children
