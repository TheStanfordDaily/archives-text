I American churches soon will be
j asked to help settle the question,
"when does Easter Sunday come?"
Varying over a period of thirty
! five days, the uncertain date of this
religious feast day has created con
. fusion and worked hardship on
business which annually caters to
j the public's fancy for new spring
toggery.
Now a League of Nations com
mittee has proposed to churches of
all nations that the Sunday after the
second Saturday in April be ac
cepted as a fixed date. A note has
i been drafted which it is hoped that
; all governments will submit to
church representatives.
Many German leaders are at
| tempting to discourage so many
j young Germans from going on with
j their educations instead of some lu-
I crative occupation.
