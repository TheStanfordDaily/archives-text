The Editor, Sir:
Ho hum. We are under the im
pression that the matter of the Call-
Bulletin's and Daily News' stories
regarding the bonfire raid was being
! forgotten, just as one attempts to>
forget a disagreeable dream. But
: since a certain Mr. McEwen has
brought up the matter in Campus
Opinion, let's go.
This worthy contemporary at
-1 tempts a distinction between sensa
tional and striking; I would like to
suggest one between "striking" and
1 "false." When a paper (such as the
Oakland Tribune) prints a headline,
; "Cal-Stanford Bonfire Raid Injures
43," that is striking. It is stretching
a point, true, but perhaps there
I were 43 students who were hurt,
| however slightly.
But when papers (such as the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin and
Daily News) print stories to the ef
fect that it was the Palo Alto fire
! department that put out the bonfire
) blaze and the. police department that
i dispersed the marauders, that is de-
I cidedly false. Nor were these all
■of the untrue statements in these
| S.F. papers.
• But why should one like the
I writer worry this misinfor
mation, Mr. McEwen may ask. Well,
in the first placo, my stand is for
i the truth, even in Hearst news
! papers (not meaning to imply that
the News is a Hearst publication).
Then, from a rather selfish stand
point, as one of those who rose from
his bed to help defend the bonfire,
I dislike having thousands of people
told (through the Call and News)
i that Stanford men could not hold
! off the attackers; that the fire de
| partment was necessary to scatter
j the invaders. And if I were a fresh
-1 man, and had worked for days to
j build and protect the bonfire, my
| indignation would be even greater.
Stanford does not need the Palo
j Alto police department to disperse
1 Cal invaders (though the tip was
I helpful and appreciated). She has
I enough real men to do this herself.
So don't fret about the Stanford
Daily giving an apology, McEwen.
i If any organ does, it should be either
i the S.F. Call or Daily News.

AND PRO
: The Editor, Sir:
The writer feels that it is time
j someone outside the Daily staff
j comes to the enlightenment of a
i certain Arthur McEwen, who has
j this day ranted on in such an asinine
manner concerning the perfectly
; leigitimate stand taken by the Daily
! Editor on the unscrupulous methods
used by a campus correspondent in
j "yellowing" his story to the Call
! Bulletin concerning the Big Game
! bonfire.
The Daily has met and will un
-1 doubtedly continue to meet the two
qualifications set by Mr. McEwcn.
ilt has the campus' respect, and it
| tries to give just editorials. It was
i only for the protection of the cam
' pus and the student body that such
! a reprimand was deemed necessary.
I The practice of "coloring" stories by
I this correspondent has been going
jon long enough, and has brought
i unfavorable and unwarranted com
jment upon this University.
If Mr. McEwen had even a slight.
| grasp of the facts and the signifi
] cance of them to the campus and
I to the Daily, he would not have
i come out with such a "blanket" and
; "cultural" criticism of this perfectly
! justified action.
Sincerely,
—Don McKean
AND PRO
j The Editor, Sir:
Your flagrant disregard for the
j inalienable rights of those who write
! letters to the paper has at last
i spurred me to rise up in righteous
wrath and take my pen in hand to

j defend the sacred citadel of popular
land right-thinking opinion. Is the
' spontaneity of bombastic effusion to
i be blighted by the Damocrean spec-
J tre of some glutted and finicky buz
j zard picking our logic to pieces in
' the public prints as his nobler and

1 cleaner brother in Nature solemnly
'and judiciously chooses between
; this or that morsel of carrion? (Dog
. gone, I was hoping to drag a "putrid
j carcass" into that metaphor, but I
i slipped up somewhere.) Is our
' phraseologic frenzy to be frustrated
[ by a sold and cynical tyrant who
j inexorably insists that our golden
i phrases mean something? Is ;he
i poetic torrent of euphonious meta
phor to be damned and fetted by
: the same quibbling etymological
: restrictions which emasculate and
! devitalize didactic literature?
In short, sir, I insist, and every
j loyal and square-shooting son of the
| Stanford Red will back me up (if
they won't, they aint); either that
i you print Arthur McEwen's letters
I without editorial comment or, pre
ferably, don't print them.
Lloyd N. Tarr
i P.S.: On the other hand, that
j would be pretty mean, you'd better
; print them. I think the boy wants
j to be a columnist when he grows up.
