The Editor, Sir:
It was with a feeling of sincere
joy that I read the Campus Opinion
by Mr. Val von Breton in the Tues
day issue of the Daily. How many
I students are inclined to sneer and
j Feoff at religion! It is encouraging
j to hear of one Stanford man who is
j a good student and a real Christian,
j The Stanford debating squad has
J done its best in the past to bring
I something of the spirit of truth and
light to a sordid and materialistic
i community. The odds against us
have been great. There is undoubt
j edly too much interest in dancing,
j football, and other types of worldli-
I ness on this campus to allow stu
| dents time to devote to the higher
; and more worthwhile things in life.
The other night as I was reading
! my Bible, I ran across a verse that
gave me hope and encouragement,
j It is II Chronicles, 39, verses 41-42.
j (The meaning in Moffatt's transla
tion is blurred so I quote from the
j King James' Version): "And a lion
i shall come forth out of the limbs
of Judah, and he shall be called
Immanuel." Somehow I felt on read
ing Mr. von Breton's Campus Opin
ion that the prophecy has at last
been fulfilled, and that Mr. von
Breton is the lion whereof spoke
the prophet. »
Mr. Blum and I feel not only that
we should welcome Mr. von Breton
to the ranks of those who are striv
ing to make religion a real thing on
this campus, but that he is entitled
to a place of leadership among us.
Accordingly, after two days of ear
nest prayer and the inspiration of
the faithful, we have designated Mr.
von Breton Archbishop of Branner
Hall, and Primate of Stanford Uni
versity. We trust that he will bring
, many souls to the way of truth and
light and we earnestly call upon the
students of this University to aid
him in the great work to which he
has been called.
