# Mayor Walker To Aid Mooney Freedom Plea
## Prisoner's Mother Pleads For Rolph's Pardon 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19. «;/P>
—Under dramatic circumstances
which will focus the attention of
the nation on the case, Governor
James Rolph on December 1 will
open hearings on a new application
for the pardon of Thomas
Mooney, convicted Preparedness
Day bomber.
The hearings will be conducted
in San Francisco, and nationally
known figures, including Mayor
James Walker of New York, Aaron
Sapiro, famous attorney, and State
Senator John A. Hastings of New
York, will appear for the first time
in support of Mooney's release.
It was a telegram from Mooney's '
aged mother, Mrs. Mary Mooney, t
that determined Mayor Walker to i
come to California. The 80-ycar- :
old woman, whose faith in her son's j
innocence has never wavered dur- j
troversy that followed the convic- !
tion, was ill at her home yesterday, 1
but she sent word that she expected j
to recover in time to give her per- i
sonal thanks to the New York offi- '
cial.
Governor Rolph, at his office in i
Sacramento, revealed that he had '
talked to Mayor Walker over long- |
distance telephone, and that ar
rangements for the hearing were |
completed.
