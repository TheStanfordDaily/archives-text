# HANLEY'S ELEVEN TO PLAY INDIANS HERE NEXT YEAR
## Al Masters Makes Up Grid Schedule For 1932; Oct. 15 Open 
### 
With the 1931 football season al
most at an end, A1 Masters, Stan
ford graduate manager, has already
lined up his 1932 conference sched
ule, and an intersectional game with
Northwestern.
Stanford opens the conference sea
son against Oregon State at Portland
on October 1. Following this comes
the colorful Northwestern game
which may prove one of the best in
tersectional games of the year.
Northwestern ranks at the top of
ihe football heap with Notre Dame,
whom they tied in an early season
battle this year, and seems destined
to finish the season without defeat.
Dick Han ley, the Wildcats' young
coach, is a disciple of Pop Warner,
and the fact that two Warner sys
tems will oppose each other should
add further interest to this encoun
ter.
With the Northwestern game be
hind them, the Cards will have to
turn their eyes toward the Southern
California Trojans, who invade Palo
Alto two weeks later on October 22.
At present, no game lias been ar
ranged for the intervening week of
the fifteenth and the date may be
left open.
Following the Trojan invasion,
Coach Warner will take his men to
Los Angeles for a game with the
up-and-coming U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Then come Washington and Idaho
on successive Saturdays, with both
games scheduled for the Stanford
Stadium.
Coming, as it dees this year, as the
last game of Stanford's conference
play, is the annual Big Game with
California to be played at Memorial
Stadium in Berkeley on Novem
ber 19.
it is more than probable that two
more games wil be added to this
schedule, one on September 24 and
another for the last week in Novem
ber. St. Mary's, Olympic Club, or
Santa Clara seem to be the first in
line for these spots on the schedule.
