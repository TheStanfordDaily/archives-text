# GREAT GRID SQUADS COME FROM SMALL BAY AREA SCHOOLS
## 
### 
Students number 1,550. Sounds
like a small school, but this figure
represents the total enrollment of j
not one school, but three, St. Mary's, i
Santa Clara, and San Francisco Uni- j
versity.
With less than one-half the num
ber of students in Stanford alone,
these three schools are able to place
on the gridiron three football teams
which can hold their own with any |
squad on the coast. The result is!
that they can no longer be referred >
to as "those little teams in the bay ■
region."
Little has to be said about St. !
Mary's. Its record speaks for itself, '
with victories over U.S.C. and Cali- i
fornia chalked up 011 consecutive
weeks. Since that time, however,
they have dropped two games, to !
the Olympic Club and U.C.L.A.
Santa Clara has had one cf those ;
disheartening "almost" seasons. The j
Broncos came within four points of!
California, then dropped their en- j
counter to the Cards 6-0. They also |
dropped games to St. Mary's and !
San Francisco, by lone touchdowns, !
but sunk the strong Olympic Club |
and Loyola (Los Angeles) teams.
San Francisco has improved stead- j
ily as the season progressed, coming j
through with a 7-0 win over Santa '
Clara last Sunday at Kezar Stadium. |
They will be a dangerous foe for 1
any team in the near future.
