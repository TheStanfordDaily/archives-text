# CAPTAINS OF BOTH TEAMS KEPT FROM HITTING TOP FORM
## Knee Injury Has Bothered Hillman; New System Ousts Griffiths 
### 
When Stanford's Harry Hillman
and California's Ed Griffiths shake
hands before 88,000 people in the
stadium tomorrow afternoon, it will
be the first, time since the days of
Ernie Nevers and '"Tut" Imlay that
the leaders of both teams in the Big
Game have been backfield men.
Captain Hilman registers from Los
Angeles. He is twenty-one years
old and weighs 201 pounds. The Car
dinal leader played on the 1927
freshman eleven, and earned a place
on the varsity in his sophomore year,
although he did no playing. In 1929
and 1930 Hillman got into the Big
Games as understudy to such men
as Fleischacker, Rothert, Simkins,
and Smalling. In 1930, Hillman
played a big part in Stanford's 41-0
victory over the Golden Bears.
New Possibilities
As captain this season, Hillman
has been kept from realizing his full
possibilities by an injured knee. But
when he has been in shape, the bar
rel-chested quai'terback has shown
himself to be one of the greatest
line plungers and blockers on the
coast.
Captain Ed Griffiths' career has
been one of great ups and downs. He
played his freshman year as a sub
stitute for McCutcheon at right half
back, but rose to a first string berth
varsity in this sophomore year. It
was as a jnior that Griffiths stamped
himself as a real triple threat back.
Although his team lost 41-0, Griffiths
had the best yardage average of any
man in last year's Big Game.
Griffiths on Bench
This year under the Bear's new
mentor, Bill Ingram, Captain Grif
fiths has failed to retain his first
string berth. On the second day of
practice he was sent back to the
second eleven, and the following
week saw the once great Bear back
playing with the third team. Grif
fiths played a few minutes in the
Saint Mary's and Washington games,
but that just about lets him out as
far as the season's play is concerned.
But Ed Griffiths is still captain. It
will hurt the the Bear leader a lot
to go out there and shake hands
with Hillman at the toss, and then
go back to his accustomed position
on the bench. Nobody knows this
better than Bill Ingram and the
California team. The Blue and Gold
eleven will be out there fighting half
of the battle for Griffiths.
The fact that Griffiths has failed to
fit in to California's new style of play

I does not alter the fact that he is a
{great captainâ€”all the more so be
j cause ho comes out for practice day
! after day and docs nil in his power
| to help the coach who relegated him
' to his substitute role.
There is a bane possibility that
j California's gallant captain will gdt
; into the fray tomorrow. If he does
!he will receive an ovation from Stan
j ford and California rooters alike.
