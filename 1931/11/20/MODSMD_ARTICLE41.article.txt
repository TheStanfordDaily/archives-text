# INDIAN TOMAHAWK NOT TO COME OUT FROM HIDING PLACE
## Cal Students Still Nursing Old Animosity And Dying Hard 
### 
For almost forty years the Si
ford Axe Has been a battle-point in
re . Inns between the University
and California. One dark year came
some decades ago when the men
across the Bay stole the prize from
I under the noses of its guards, and
it remained in their possession until
the glorious 1930 when the bold 21
i returned it to its rightful owners.
1 Since its return to the Farm the
steel-on-a-stiek has been in the
strongest room ot a Palo Alto bank.
| It does not make its appearance on
I such important occasions as Big
; Game rallies, for the keepers of the
. Bear don't give up easily, and the
1 wounds they got when the axe was
I retaken haven't healed
Authorities on the T rnounce
emphatically that the ./ill not
come out this year. A glimnse of
1 the traditional battle sign would un
doubtedly stimulate the Sons of the
Stanford Red on to a more complete
; annihilation of the Bear. But the
! effcct on the Cal men is to be
thought of. Territory on both sides
of the Bay would be devastated in
the battle that would ensue, the
campi of both Universities would
run with blood, and there would be
no more Big Game.
Bill Doub uses tomato catchup on
everything he eats, and is sensitive
