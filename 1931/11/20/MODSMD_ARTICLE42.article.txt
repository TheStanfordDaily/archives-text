California 13, Stanford 0.
Fond hopes of t!ic lirst Cali
foriiia victory over Stanford
since 1923 werc tlnis expressed
by paint-slinging Bears on the
Quad the other niorning.
That's too optimistic, even for
Californians. Stanford will
score, even without Phil Molïatt,
even through that stubborn de
fcnse of the Bil! Ingram eleven.
On the other hand, the Bears
may, or may not, score. If thcy
do, the score should be Stanford
13, California (!.
Perhaps wc are too optimistic,
hut it's a hunch, and 5s ïre
sented for what it is worth, if
anything.
OPINION SEEMS to favor Berke
ley, although brozen, unqualified
predictions of a victory either way
are few and far between. "Toss-up
is the expression we hear as much
as any other, even from radical
Stanford fans.
In early season Santa Clara play
ers, aftcr facing both teams, were
inclined to string with Stanford. On
the other hand, the Olympic Club
eleven declared for California, after
outplaying the Indians in a scoie
less tic and taking a six-to-nothing
licking from the Bears.
The Olympic Club game is a
much bcttcr criteria than ihe
Bronco affair, which was Ingram',;
opener. Navy Biil was beginning tó
get organized when he dumoed the
club, and his line functioned much
better against the Winged "O" than
did Stanford's.
But at that, the Club coaching
staff isn't agreed on the Large Con
test. Percy Locey, head coach, likes
the Bears, while Jack Hubbard, his
assistant, picks the Indians.
AFTER THE Stanford-SoutJi
ern California aiïair. Max Plake,
sports editor of the Daily Tro
jan, picked Stanford, hut we
are afraid the wish was father
to the thought. They don't waste
any iove on California down
south.
On the Monday following the
game Plake secured a state
ment from H<?ad Man Jones for
us, in which Jones succeeded
in saying very little.
"I think Stanford lias a good
chancc to defeat California,"
said the Trojan mentor, "BUT
I AM NOT SURE. I am not sure
of anything in foothall."
It ALL proves very little. Pop
Wai'ner was the first to call it a
toss-up, and toss-up it seems to
be. Let's let it go at that until 5
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
