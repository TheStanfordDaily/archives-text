# THIRD STRAIGHT WIN OVER CALIFORNIA FOR INDIAN SWORDSMEN
## 
### 
Cardinal fencing competition got
off to a good start this year with the
capture of the Herron cup trophy
by the Indian swordsmen. The tro
phy is contested for each year by
Stanford, California and the Olympic
Club. For the past year, the cup has
been in possession of the club.
The big event of the winter quar
ter will be the Stanford-California
meet, which has been won by the
Indians for the past two consecutive
years. The spring feature in fenc
ing will take place at the Minor
Sports Carnival to be held in Los
Angeles by California colleges in
April.
A good deal of promising material
has come up to the varsity from last
year's freshman squad as well as
most of last year's varsity men re
turning. The biggest hole which
Coach Elwin Bugge has had to fill
was that left by the graduation of
Jack Snyder last spring, the ambi
dextrous lad who led the Indian
swordsmen's attack last year.
The ranking list at present in
cludes John Ferguson, Len Pockman,
Dick Criley, Fred Pearman, and Tom
Pockman. A1 Snyder, Harry White
field, and Ed Munger are among the
members of last year's freshmen
squad who have made exceptional
progress during their time on the
varsity.
