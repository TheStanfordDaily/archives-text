# ERNIE SMITH WON'T TRY PREDICTION OF BIG GAME RESULT
## 
### 
Ernie Smith, Columbia's official
sports announcer of football games,
has been predicting scores over sta
tion KTAB lately. Last week, he
called the Stanford-Nevada game
27-0, missing the result by one point.
He also picked California over Idaho,
19-6. In this selection he was one
touchdown off, the Vandals failing
to score.
Smith predicted the Washington-
Washington State game 18-0, missing
it by four digits when the Huskies
won 14-0. Asked to comment on the
Big Game, he refused to pick a
score, but said that the "biggest
threat of Stanford against Cal will
bo the 'long-span' passâ€”the last
minute scoring play successful both
in the U.C.L.A. and the Nevada
games."
