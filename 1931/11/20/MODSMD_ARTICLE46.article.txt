# California Sees Card Defeat Possible At Last
## INGRAM'S CHANGES FOR VICTORY REST ON NEW OFFENSE Berkeley Campus Hopes To Take Game But Lacks Real Confidence 
### SHERWOOD E. WIRT

The Golden Bears will make their
I biennal pilgrimage Saturday, once
i again invading the Stanford campus
!as favorites, once again trying to
! bring home tho bacon that has been
] peacefully frying on the peninsula
for the last eight years.
Whether or not the powerful
| fighting aggregation developed in
i two months by Coach Bill Ingram
J will be strong enough to halt the
i Warner reserves and break up
; Stanford's feared passing attack re
i mains to be seen by some 88,000
| spectators.
We at California have never
known a Warner-coached team that
I was not brilliant on the gridiron.
: The scores so far this season are
rejected in Berkeley as being value-
I less in figuring the comparative
abilities of the two teams.
Injured Men Important
Of much more importance is the
' ability of Phil Moffatt to play, the
condition of Gus Castro's leg, which
i suffered a pulled tendon in the
: Husky game, and the return of
; George Watkins to the lineup.
California is conceded to have the
| stronger line of the two teams, yet
| that line will have its hands full
| trying to find the white-shirted
| ball-carrier Saturday. On offenseâ€”
that is where the Bears hope to
! shine. Heretofore we have always
relied on our stonewall defense to
bring us victory, or something close
to it. Now, with a new system of
attack threatening the impregna
bility of that defense, the offense
must be counted on heavily.
Good Ball Toters
California has two of the finest
I ball-carriers on the coast in Hank
I Schaldach and Lej Valianos. Stan
i ford will learn plenty about these
men before the game is very old.
Schaldach has never played against
the Cardinals, and he is hotter now
i than ever. The same goes for Rusty
| Gill, the most savage tackier this
writer ever saw.
At end, Ralph Stone is likely to
receive all-coast mention. He out
j played the famed Arbelbide from
; U.S.C. until the latter was yanked
j from the game. He has a beautiful
knack of smashing into interference
from behind on end runs and
throwing the ball-carrier. Likewise
he is a premier pass-received, as
is his mate, Louis Di Resta. This
chunky little wingman is just get
ting over a bad foot injury, but he
is set to go.
Sophs Prove Strong
Ransome and Carlson, sophomores,
I hold down the left side of the line
! with Stone, and have played in
j every regular game this year for
practically the full time. They are
invaluable to Ingram, and he counts
on them to hold Stanford. In the
middle of the line is Butch Medan
ich, roving center, the oldest, most
experienced player on the squad.
Butch's steadiness and defensive
ability make him the recognized
leader of the first eleven.
Bob McArthur and Sam Gill are
fighting it out for right guard. Not
much choosing between them; they
! both have improved remarkably
this season. Dick Tozer, right tackle,
is a whale of a good man.
Kirwan, Smith Even
To wind up the first eleven, Ed
Kirwan and Joe Smith are on even
terms for the quarterback position.
If Kirwan has a good day he v/ill
;go far Saturday. Lee Valianos is
| sure to see action. He has never
j failed to bring the crowd to its feet
this year.
California has a good team; she
has had good teams in the past, and
; they have fallen. We do not think
I this one will fall; but if it docs, the
j Stanford stadium will know about
| it. California is a last-quarter team.
