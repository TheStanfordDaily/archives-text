# Soccer Big Game Is Scheduled Saturday
## Tomorrows Game Is Third of Annual Big Series and Stanford Enters as Decided Favorite 
### BOB WADE 
ROASTING a record of six victories and only one lie. Coach Harry
Maloncy s soccer varsity last night prepared a warm reception for the
Berkeley Bears when they meet in the third game of the annual Big Series
Saturday morning at 10:30 o'clock. With the entire squad recovered from
the effects of last week's struggle at California, Coach Maloncy can start
his strongest lineup if lie needs to. Chances are, however, that the suh
â€¢ stitutes will have more than a look-

in on this third game.
The last two games, both result
l ing in Stanford victories, proved
that all the Cards must do is bottle
California's captain and star, Fran
cis Smart, to take the punch out of
the Bear's attack.
May Be Last Game
There is a chance that this game
will ring the curtain down on the
| soccer careers of the six regulars
that the Indians will lose through
graduation next June. If San Mateo
can upset the San Francisco Uni
versity Hilltoppers today, Stanford
will have undisputed claim to the
league championship.
This is the first time in the his
tory of soccer at Stanford that the
Cards have produced an undefeated
team, and although the California
i Intercollegiate Soccer Conference is
only a year or two old, it is also
the first time that the Indians have
taken-the league and the California
Series at the same time.
Captain Falk, at right-inside; Bill
Mearns, at right-outside; Emmet
Hayes, right-half; Preston Plumb,
j left-half; "Buster" Holmes, right -
I fullback, and Jimmie Webster,
goalie, will all be taking their last
crack at the Bears, when the Cards
! swing into action tomorrow morn
ing.
Varsity Prospects
This year's team boasts four
i sophomores and two jniors, in
addition to Qie half-dozen sopho
mores on the second string; which
means that Coach Maloncy will
i have first-class teams for at least
two years to come. Besides these,
j the freshmen will send up six nu
| meral winners who would make ar.y
varsity man step for his position.
But it is to the ranks of the
inelligible that soccer fans may
turn for the coming star of future
j Stanford soccer teams. In Cyril
! Johnson, Coach Maloncy has found
! the answer to his prayers, offered
up for innumerable seasons past, a
| real scoring threat.
i Throughout the past season,
whenever the varsity found the
substitutes pushing them around
the field, it was largely due to the
j work of Johnson at center-forward.
