# IRISH FAVORED OVER TROJANS
## Hunk Anderson Is Capable Successor To Rockhe 
### 
.
j U.S.C. is the UNDER DOG.
It has been a long time since a
. Trojan rival has been favored to
win; nevertheless that is the plight
of Howard Jones' warriors as they
enter their annual grid classic wi'.h
the Notre Dame Ramblers at South
Bend tomorrow.
The Irish are the favorites because
of the big upset they handed Troy
iast year and because of iheir
brilliant record thus far this sea
son under the direction of Knute
Rockne's successor, Hunk Anderson.
The Ramblers have only one blem
i ish on an otherwise perfect season.
' They were battled to a scoreless tie
j early in the season by Northwestern
! in a sea of mud.
However, the Trojans, with a col
| lection of all-Americansâ€”Shaver,
1 Pinckert, Mohler, Musick, and Ar
: belbide, who have averaged nearly
| 400 yards from scrimmage per game,
j can be expected to give the Irish a
; much tougher argument than they
I did last year. U.S.C. this year is
i unquestionably one of the greatest
I teams ever produced in the West
and will enter the game tomorrow
j determined to bring back its first
victory over Notre Dame on its
home grounds.
Since the Trojans and Irish took
lup football relations in 1927, the
Irish have won all but one of the
, contests. Two were played in Chi
! cago and two were held in the Los
! Angeles Coliseum. In both the Eaot
! ern games the Trojans lost by a
margin of one point, bringing home
I the short end of a 13 to 12 score.
