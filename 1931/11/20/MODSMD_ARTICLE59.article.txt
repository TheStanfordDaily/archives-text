# CORBUS, COLVIN MAY GAIN COAST HONORS; PINCKERT SLATED FOR ALL-AMERICAN
## 
### Maurice Rapf 
Mythical teams, the pet division of
newspapers and football fans alike
after the football season is over, are
already being discussed by our
prominent sports writers.
On the Pacific Coast this year the
i team pickers are going to have a
I touch time selecting the four oest
i backfield men for their mythical 1
i elevens. Speedy backs have been ,
j cavorting on the coast gridirons in
i great numbers, while good linemen
j have been fewer and far between.
U.S.C. Quarterbacks
Perhaps the most outstanding back
on the coast and one who is virtually
a cinch to retain his place on the ail-
American teams again this year is
Southern California's great Ernie
Pinckert. Ernie gained recognition j
last season, because of his ability as
a blocking halfback, but this year
has proven himself to be an out- <
standing ball-carrier as well.

; Gus Shaver and Orv Mohlcr, i
Troy's alternate quarterbacks have j
also won glory for themselves this ;
| year, while on the U.S.C. line, Capt. j
| Stan Williamson at center and Ernie j
Smith at tackle have shown signs of ;
â€¢ brilliance, although Smith has an oc
casional off day.
Pop Warner has developed two j
j outstanding linemen this season. Don ]
Colvin has'proved one of the sea-|
j son's best pass catchers and offen- {
sive ends, while Bill Corbus, in his j
first year on the varsity, has already j
won considerable fame as one of j
the most promising guards in the |
country.
Gill Is I?ig Hope
At ( alifornia, Bill Ingram has.
I Rusty Gill, perhaps the outstanding i
; defensive back on the const. It was j
Gill who so successfully backed un i
' the line against the Trojans, and it!
!is expected that his work will be'

effective tomorrow in bottling up the
Stanford reverses. Stone at end,
Medanich in the center position, and
two other good backfield men, Schal
dach and Watkins have received
considerable praise for their work
this year. Schaldach and Watkins, !
however, have both been handicap
ped by injuries.
In the northwest, steller backfield
men have been Hufford, and Bledsoe
of Washington, Sanders of W.S.C.,
Smith of Idaho, and Krause of Gon
zaga.
