### Albert Guerard 
'"Pop" Warner's 1931 varsity will i
trek eastward following the Bis j
Game tomorrow, to make its final j
bid for national recognition, when it j
meets Dartmouth, Saturday, Novcm- I
ber 28, in the Harvard Stadium.
Last year the two teams met at j
Stanford, and the Indians won, 14-6,
in a game featured by the playing j
of Dartmouth halfbacks Bill Morton ,
and Bill McCall.
Dartmouth's team this year has
been the surprise of eastern foot- i
ball. Their first two opponents were J
set ups. Norwich fell 51-6, and Buf- ,
falo 61-0. Against Holy Cross, Coach
Jackson Cannell's men showed their
best all-around offense of the year, j
winning 14-7.
Then came the low spot of the sea- I
son, a 19-6 defeat by Columbia. The
Green team was unimpressive in
winning from Lebanon Valley, ,20-6,1
on the following Saturday.
The Yale game followed, in which !
Dartmouth startled the football
world with the greatest thriller in
recent years. The final score was
33-33. Yale left the field for the half
on the long end of a 26-10 score.
Just after the third quarter started
Yale added further to her almost
hopeless lead, with a pass, Lassiter
to Barres, making the count 33-10.
And then the Dartmouth team got
mad, and scored three touchdowns '
and a field goal in rapid succession.
The following week Dartmouth
lost a heartbreaking game to Har
vard, the cast's only unbeaten team, j
7-6, but last Saturday Cannell's men
turned in their best performance of
the year in upsetting an undefeated
Cornell eleven, 14-0. Two great |
| passes, Morton to McCall, connected
for touchdowns.
