# CARDINAL FROSH WIND UP DULL SEASON BY HOLDING U.C. CUBS TO 7-0 VICTORY
## 
### 
j Stanford's freshman football squad
ended an otherwise dull season ihis
year by a great stand against the
powerful, undefeated California Bear
] Cub team.
After making an auspicious begin,
j ning by swamping Marin J.C. 37 to 0,
they dropped into u slump from
I which they never emerged until the
i Little Big Game, which wound up
; their season. Against California they
: came to life, played as a unified team
! for the first time, and held the Gold
| and Blue to a slim 7 to 0 victory.
Bob Moore, who came from lowa
I to play for the Cardinals, stands out
; as the most promising backfield man
■ on the squad. This rugged boy shines
i best as a ball carrier, and he is
i plenty tough, he resembles a slip-
I pery, twisting, squirming eel when
j the opposing players attempt to drag
him down. Moore also did the punt
i ing iOr the freshmen, is a good block
! er and can pass if necessary.
While Bob Moore at full and half
gets most of the publicity as far as
j backfield play is concerned, he had
] able assistance. Lory Rothert, kid
j brother of the famous Harlow, plays
i left half, and shared (his position
j with Bowles. Both men are flashy
! in the open field and at safety.
I Butts is another half who showed
| great improvement at the end of
j the season, and Flippcn, while light,
I backs up a line with vigor. Seaver,
j better known as a golf star, is a dan
! gerous blocker and good defensive
I man.
j Glancing over the Indian yearling
! line we sec four men in particular
j whom we predict are going to make

| themselves heard from in later years
I —Abrahamsen at end, Lettunich, at
tackle, Van Kirk, center, and Cap
tain Johnny Mottram, guard. Mot
jtram is fairly light but he combines
his weight with enough speed and
plain tight to sparkle. Van Kirk has
been injured most of the season and
has not had a full opportunity to
show his stufT. Abrahamsen and
I Lettunich played outstanding games
i against California.
