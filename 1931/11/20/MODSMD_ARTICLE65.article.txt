# WARNER'S HOBBIES SHOW ALL-AROUND ARTISTIC ABILITY
## Pop Equally Good At Golf, Tinkering, Inventing, And Painting 
### 
While Pop Warner, Card gridiron
mentor, is essentially a football
eoach, he can't be classed with the
physical education director who can
do his job and nolhing else. Neither
can he be classed with the jack
of-all-trades who can do everything
after a fashion but nothing well.
When Pop goes into a thing he
goes into it with all his energy and
power. A good example of this
phase of Pop's character can be
seen in the fact that during the
summer, he and "Tiny" Thornhill
took a fishing trip that covered
more than G,OOO miles and traversed
10 states in the western section of
the United States. And the trip was
not one of those luckless
both men caught the limit nearly
every day out.
Pop as Tinker
And then the Old Man is a
tinker. He has an electric lathe in
his basement and spends much of
his spare time there turning odd
parts for his many "inventions." He
has three cars in his garage that he
tears down and rebuilds whenever
the mood strikes him. The new and
shining "family sedan" reposes day
after day in the garage while ihe
Wizard of Football drives a long
worn-out car of some almost for
gotten make to and from the B.A C,
"He's just funny that way," explains
"Tiny."
The Stanford head coach plays
golf for recreation and because he
likes the game, not because it's an
"old man's game.' He invents new
clubs when he can't find the one to
iit his stroke and doctors up old
ones when he wants to experiment.
Yes, he plays golf, but NOT during
football season.
Invents Equipment
When Pop is not tinkering with
his cars, not inventing new golf
clubs, not perfecting "peppermint
panties" (they also were the result
of the Old Man), and not doing a
hundred and one other things, he
develops football equipment. His
charging machines and tackling
dummies of every sort and descrip
tion are used at Colgate, Northwest
ern, and other eastern colleges.
Then, of course, ihere is Pop's
painting and writing. When he takes
up the palette and brush his whole
personal character goes into the
work, all the carefulness and love
of detail in the man is shown. The
same characteristics mark his writ
ten articles. In any of Pop's literary
efforts, magazines, books, or news
paper syndicates, the touch of the
master shows through the film of
journalistic technicalities.

Invents Equipment
When Pop is not tinkering with
his cars, not inventing new golf
clubs, not perfecting "peppermint
panties" (they also were the result
of the Old Man), and not doing a
hundred and one other things, he
develops football equipment. His
charging machines and tackling
dummies of every sort and descrip
tion are used at Colgate, Northwest
ern, and other eastern colleges.
Then, of course, ihere is Pop's
painting and writing. When he takes
up the palette and brush his whole
personal character goes into the
work, all the carefulness and love
of detail in the man is shown. The
same characteristics mark his writ
ten articles. In any of Pop's literary
efforts, magazines, books, or news
paper syndicates, the touch of the
master shows through the film of
journalistic technicalities.
While Pop Warner, Card gridiron
mentor, is essentially a football
eoach, he can't be classed with the
physical education director who can
do his job and nolhing else. Neither
can he be classed with the jack
of-all-trades who can do everything
after a fashion but nothing well.
When Pop goes into a thing he
goes into it with all his energy and
power. A good example of this
phase of Pop's character can be
seen in the fact that during the
summer, he and "Tiny" Thornhill
took a fishing trip that covered
more than G,OOO miles and traversed
10 states in the western section of
the United States. And the trip was
not one of those luckless
both men caught the limit nearly
every day out.
Pop as Tinker
And then the Old Man is a
tinker. He has an electric lathe in
his basement and spends much of
his spare time there turning odd
parts for his many "inventions." He
has three cars in his garage that he
tears down and rebuilds whenever
the mood strikes him. The new and
shining "family sedan" reposes day
after day in the garage while ihe
Wizard of Football drives a long
worn-out car of some almost for
gotten make to and from the B.A C,
"He's just funny that way," explains
"Tiny."
The Stanford head coach plays
golf for recreation and because he
likes the game, not because it's an
"old man's game.' He invents new
clubs when he can't find the one to
iit his stroke and doctors up old
ones when he wants to experiment.
Yes, he plays golf, but NOT during
football season.
