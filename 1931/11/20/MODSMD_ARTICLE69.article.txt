## 
### 
"Red" Hand, varsity tackle, was
camp boss of a United States Blister
Rust Control camp this summer, in
Lassen National Forest. Of the 20
college students under him, over
half were from Stanford three of
them were members of the varsity
squad—Bill Doub, Jack White, and
Ted Kite.
"Red" was known as ''Father
Hand." Then there was also "Moth
er Brown," known here as Robert
Brown, A.S.S.U. president.
The work consisted of tramping
over forest ridges in groups of three,
grubbing out wild gooseberry and
currant bushes. It was an experi
ment to determine the cost of pro
tecting white pine forests from blis
ter rust, a disease which spreads
from the bush to a tree, and back
to another bush. Hand has been en
gaged in this work for several years.
Stanford vs. California baseball
contests were held between Hand's
camp and a nearby outfit chiefly
composed of University of California
students. It is claimed the Stanford
camp won.
