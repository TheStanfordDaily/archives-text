{ Why do women attend football
games? The answer would seem ob
vious: because they like them. Some
cynical men might reply, "The Lord
only knows!"
Now, however, the true reasons
have been brought to light. A sur
vey has been made of 100 women
who habitually grace the women's
rooting section at games. The as
tounding results follow.
Thirty-three go because everyone
else does; eight, because they like to
â€¢ show oft' their sports cloths;* five, to
become familiar with the team so
! that they can answer questions
which their home town friends may

: ask about the players; 13, because
I they don't know what else to do on
! Saturday afternoons; 11, because
they like to pit in the rooters' sec
tion; eight, because they feel that
; they ought to attend the games;
five, because their boy friends invite
' them; 10 only go to big, inter-sec
] tional games; five, because they like
to see the other people in the crowd,
' [-specially the other girls' clothes;
have gone.
Whether a similar survey among
the men would yield a similar result
is a matter for conjecture; but the
sad, sad story concerning the women
I is settled once and for all.
