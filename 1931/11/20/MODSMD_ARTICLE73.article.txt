CHICAGO. Nov. 1F(—(/P)—Secreta
-1 ry of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde
j opened the Land Utilization Confer
• ence today with an admonition that 1
the "pathos and problems'' in farm |
| lands emphasized the immediate j
I need for a long time program.
Called by Secretary Hyde and the 1
Association of Land Grant Colleges,
! the conference was a frank admis- I
j sion that too much land was under .
| cultivation.
"There is both dynamite and en- j
lightenment," the Secretary said, "in
1 the fact that there were 84,000 fewer
farms in 1930 than in 1925 but that j
! there were 15,000,000 more acres in j
| crops. The 366,000,000 acres planted
I to crops in IS3O was 55,000,000 acres '
I more than our cultivated area in j
j 1909 and larger than the war time :
; peak of 1919." }
The need for the conference, Sec- j
! retary Hyde said, "lies in the vast !
waste of humand and material re- '
i sources taking place in our rural
| areas."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. (fi>) — j
