# TENNIS COURTS TO BE REPAIRED SOON
## 
### 
First steps toward improving the
condition of the men's tennis courts
on the campus will be taken soon,
according to A1 Masters, graduate
manager. Weather permitting, re
surfacing of the various courts will
take place during the Christmas
vacation.
Surfaces on many of the courts
have become rough and are in need
of repair. Resurfacing will cost $400,
it is estimated.
The Board of Athletic Control is
considering the installation of sterl
nets for the eight practice courts.
These nets cost more originally but
last indefinitely. It is not planned,
however, to use steel nets in con
ference competition on the three
varsity courts.
Women's tennis courts on the
campus are reported by Dr. Bertha
Stuart Dyment to be in worse con
dition than the men's.
"Approximately $1,000 is needed
to repair the women's tennis courts,"
Dr. Dyment said, "but there is no
immediate prospect of the money
being available, since the new
women's gymnasium with its in
creased upkeep expense is being
run on the budget for the old gym
nasium.
