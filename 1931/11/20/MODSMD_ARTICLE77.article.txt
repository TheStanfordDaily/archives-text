# CLEANEST GAME
## 
### 
The cleanest game of football ever
played. That's what those who saw
I the Tennessee-Vanderbilt game at
Knoxville last Saturday decided as
! they left the stadium after Tennes
| see had trimmed Vanderbilt 21-7.
j The entire sixty minutes of foot
ball went by without a single pen
' alty being called.
At a greyhound racing club just
1 opened in London members may
: dine and watch the races without
i leaving their tables.
