# SPRINT STAR NOW AT MENLO COLLEGE
## 
### 
A1 Fitch, who was named by
Charley Paddock as the best sprint
ing prospect he had ever seen, is
now attending Menlo Junior Col
lege. He soon hopes to transfer to
Stanford and run under "Dink"
Templeton.

Fitch once ran the 100 in fI.G in
high school, but is considered an
even better prospect at Ihe 220 than
in the century race.
