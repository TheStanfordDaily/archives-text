# EARLY BIG GAME SPIRIT REVIEWED BY DEAN CULVER
## Game A University Affair When Played In S.F. Says "Old Grad" 
### 
In reminiscence of early Big
Games, George Bliss Culver say.s:
"The Stanford-California football
classic used to be more of a Uni
versity affair than it is now. Of
course, there were the parades down
Market Street to the Palace Hotel,
and the train trips up and back, but
now it is more of a spectacle."
'"The games were held down town
in San Francisco in an old ball park
and the students didn't go near the
rival's campus to celebrate. This
was one reason for the absence of
raids, painting of Big ( 's, and pre
mature burnings of campaniles in ef
figy. For the purpose oi breaking a
jinx, the latter custom was estab
lished after a defeat by California."
"Stanford was far from San Fran
cisco then. That's why we beat
them so much—they didn't know
what was going on down here."
Dean Culver thus explained the tra
ditional yearly beatings that Califor
nia has taken at the hands of Stan
ford ever since there was a Stanford
and a "Cal' to be beaten.

"The football players of the '90's
let their hair grow long, and didn't
shave for about a week before ihe
game so as to look fierce and wild
as possible." But (hat wasn't the
only reason for the mop and the
brush; they were shock absorbers
that saved broken heads and cut
faces, besides frightening the enemy
so that he trembled in his eleated
shoes.
