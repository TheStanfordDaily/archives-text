# Lapiere Psychoanalyzes Big Game Football Mob
## 
### 
Spectator cnthusiasm for tonior
row's Big Game was developed by
the same psychological ballyhoo used
to arouse the American public to
war-madncss in 1917. The Big Game
bonflre, and painting the big "C" red
are manifestations of this spirit, ac
cording to Richard T. LaPiere, in
structor in social psychology.
"The football spectators are a vi
carious mob," he declares. "The
game is a safety valve giving the
spectator the emotional satisfaction
of irrntional mob behavior without

rcsulting in the destructive results
of mob madness.
"During tho last war the Allins
built a stadium in Paris for athletic
contcsts so that the soldiers could
get thoir emotional outlct vicari
ously.
"Interstimulation within the group
builds up its unity and the enthusi
astic pitch which the crowd reaches
before the game may be compared to
war enthusiasm, and loyalty and an
tagonism are just as irrational.
