### 
Spectator cnthusiasm for tonior
row's Big Game was developed by
the same psychological ballyhoo used
to arouse the American public to
war-madncss in 1917. The Big Game
bonflre, and painting the big "C" red
are manifestations of this spirit, ac
cording to Richard T. LaPiere, in
structor in social psychology.
"The football spectators are a vi
carious mob," he declares. "The
game is a safety valve giving the
spectator the emotional satisfaction
of irrntional mob behavior without

rcsulting in the destructive results
of mob madness.
"During tho last war the Allins
built a stadium in Paris for athletic
contcsts so that the soldiers could
get thoir emotional outlct vicari
ously.
"Interstimulation within the group
builds up its unity and the enthusi
astic pitch which the crowd reaches
before the game may be compared to
war enthusiasm, and loyalty and an
tagonism are just as irrational.
"We fan the flame of loyalty to our j
Alma Mater by rallies, pep talks, and ;
bonfires all involving the intensifica
tion of common sterotypes and the •
direction of response towards a j
single and common antagonist.
"Then, on the day of the game, we !
bring together people with highly
intensified reactions. Their presence,
side by side, unites them on an eino- 1
tional plane in much the same way
that rumor gains intensification and j
verification passing from one person 1
to another.
"The audiences on each side of the t
field become welded into more or J
less homogeneous entities in which i
individuality is lost and in which j
the response becomes group rather j
than individual.
"Our major enjoyment, whether '
one is at a gladiatorial contest, a j
bull-fight, or even a circus, comes i
not so much from the actual events
witnessed as from the fact of the
emotionality.
"The essential difference between
an ordinax-y theatre audience and
an audience at a football game is
that the members of the former are
critical of that which they are wit- '
nessing and are less inclined to be
pleased by simple and trivial things,
whereas the football, crowd, being
emotionalized and unified, the mem
bers are uncritical, easily pleased or
angei-ed, and swayed, not so much
by individual judgment, as by the
emotionality of the group.

"Interstimulation within the group
builds up its unity and the enthusi

field become welded into more or J
less homogeneous entities in which i
individuality is lost and in which j
the response becomes group rather j

"Our major enjoyment, whether '
one is at a gladiatorial contest, a j
bull-fight, or even a circus, comes i
not so much from the actual events

emotionality.
"The essential difference between
an ordinax-y theatre audience and
an audience at a football game is
that the members of the former are
critical of that which they are wit- '

pleased by simple and trivial things,
whereas the football, crowd, being
emotionalized and unified, the mem
bers are uncritical, easily pleased or
angei-ed, and swayed, not so much
by individual judgment, as by the
emotionality of the group.
