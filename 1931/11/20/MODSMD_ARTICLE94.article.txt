# STANFORD TRAINER HAS LONG RECORD AS WARNER AIDE
## Wallace Denny Picks Ernie Nevers And Thorpe As Best In Backfield 
### 
Wallace Denny, the Stanford j
trainer whose sensational dashes
across the turf to aid wounded grid- I
iron warriors have more than once i
been the longest runs made in Car- j
dinnl football games, has been ihe ,
official conditioner for Pop War- [
ncr's men for 32 years. Denny and i
Warner first hooked up at Carlisle ;
in 1399, when Pop was made head I
football coach at that institution, j
Denny stayed at Carlisle while j
Warner went to Cornell, returned j
to Carlisle, and then made his great ]
record at Pittsburgh.
Knows Toot ball
In 1922, Denny, along with Tiny |
Thornhill and Andy Kerr, camc to j
Stanford to prepare the way for j
Pop's arrival on the campus in 1924. j
Since then, Denny has seen every
football game in which Stanford has |
participated. Wallace knows his
football, and believes that Novels, |
Post, Hibbs. Wilson, BradshnW, I
Bailey, DeGroot, and the Shipkeys I
are the best all-round coast grid- I
iron artists that he has seen per- j
form.
Denny also has his personal an- i
swer to that eternal question: "Who j
is the greatest of them all?" Like 1
Pop Warner, Denny believes that j
Jim Thorpe and Ernie Nevers, both ,
of whom played under the W arner I
system, lead the all-Americans cf |
all time. Wallace is inclined to favor !
Thorpe due to the great Indian j
halfback's combination of speed and
power and general versatility, ai- ;
though he detracts no glory from
Nevers. Denny considers two other j
Warner products—Rothert and Cud- (
deback —pre-eminent in the special j
fields of punting and place-kicking. I

As usual, Denny openly predicts j
a Stanford victory in the Big Game
He doesn't understand the "mys- j
tery" attached to this year's edition. J
of the Fed Machine; instead, he has t
watched an industrious group of I
men improve steadily. The game, j
according to Denny, "will be be- j
Iweon two of the "fightingest' teams ;
on the coast; one playing a steady, j
heady, conscientious game, and the j
other playing rather recklessly and J
taking many chanccs." And Denny j
is going to bet on the steady team.
