# FIELD GOALS COUNT

### 
Bill Morton, star quarterback of
the Dartmouth varsity, when at
tending Flushing (N.Y.) High School
leaped from the stands and entered a
game in civilian clothes, kicking a
field goal which won the game for
his team. Morton made two field
goals against Yale this year, tying
the score.
