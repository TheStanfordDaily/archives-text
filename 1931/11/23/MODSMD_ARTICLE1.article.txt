# INDIAN OLYMPIC PROSPECTS OUT OF I.C.4-A. MEET
## Templeton Will Not Enter Eastman And Possibly Others In 1932 TWO DATES CONFLICT California Strikes Snag In Fulfilling Contract 
### 
Stanford track stars who are ex
pected to make the United States
Olympic Games team next summei
will not be entered in the 1.C.4-A.
meet at Berkeley July 8-9.
This announcement, which deals
a staggering blow to Stanford s
chance for victory in the college
championship competition, was
made yesterday by Dink Templeton,
Indian head coach, as result ot the
recent shift of the 1.C.4-A. dates
from July 1-2 to July 8-9. This
brings the meet to within a week of
the final Olympic team trials to be
held here July 15-16.
Eastman Out
"It's murder," Dink said, in com
menting on the resulting schedule
for college athletes who hope to
make the final tryouts. Since the in
tercollegiate struggle will be at high
peak in the season, it will be almost
impossible for the athletes to escape
going stale in the finals only six
tlays later, Templeton asserted.
Ben Eastman, record-breaking
middle-distance man, is one .Indian
who is certain to be kept out of
the Berkeley meet, and others vvho
are expected to show Olympic cali
ber during the season will also be
saved.
These athletes will compete in the
semi-final trials at Long Beachc
July 1-2 instead of using the 1.C.4-A.
meet to qualify for the finals, ac
cording to Dink.
Date May Change
It is hoped that the intercollegiate
meet can be moved back a week, in
which case Stanford would enter a
full learn.
According to Alfred Masters,
general manager of the Board of
Athletic Control, the 1.C.4-A. was
scheduled for July 8-9 in order to
increase the gate receipts at Berke
ley. The University of California,
which is staging the event, offered
the association a guarantee of
$65,000, and Graduate Manager Wil
liam Monahan feared that the guar
antee could not be met on the first
week-end in July on account of the
exodus of people from the bay re
gion for the four-day holiday period
of July 1, 2, 3, 4.
Stanford and U.S.C. have agreed
to contribute the amount of their
usual traveling expenses for the
trip East to Philadelphia or Cam
bridge, amounting from $5,000 to
$7,000 apiece, but even so, Monahan
will have to fill the new California
stadium, which seats 20,000, in order
to make expenses.
Fifteen thousand is considered to
be a good crowd for the meet in the.
East, masters said, so a capacity
crowd at Berkeley is doubtful.
