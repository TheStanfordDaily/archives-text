# '31 GAIETIES HITS MANY HIGH SPOTS
## Engleman Carries Show In Smooth Fashion; Two Acrobats Star 
### Mary Louise James 
By Mary Louise James

Very good in spots; dragging in
others. Some excruciatingly funny
skits, some would-bc funny men
who didn't get across at all. And
that was Ram's Head's 1931 Football
Gaieties.
Eph Engleman, really a stage
veteran, carried the show along
smoothly as master of ceremonies,
and the audience discovered two
first-class acrobats, heard two good
songs and saw a pretty good chorus,
as Stanford choruses run (or dance).
Not too much football was mixed
up in it, although nobody was al
lowed to forget what the show was
all about.
Individual honors of the evening
went to Engleman, Carl Cartwright
for his expurgated version of "The
Tattooed Lady" and his share of
the lyrics for "II Grande Giuoco,"
the finale; a mysterious pair billed
as Peavy and Dalton who staged as
good an acrobatic act as any pro
fessionals could have put on; Win
stead Weaver, in a hat-changing,
tripartite monologue that had even
Ihe hard-to-please roughs scream
ing with laughter; Jean Jamison, for
her pleasing renditions of Bob
Thornton's "Waiting for You," and
Engleman's "Fed-headed Man," and
Bob Cathcart, for the best full
length skit of the show, "For Dear
Old Hanford."
Jim Moller sang his own composi
tion, "She's Got Athlete's Foot," and
received a fairly big hand. Bern
hardt Springer was plenty good in
some impressionistic dances.
The rest of the performance was
just so-so. Most of the skits were
pretty sketchy affairs, and the actors
didn't make the most of the "punch"
lines at the finish. A notable excep
tion was Bob Cathcart's "Barber
Shop," which had great possibilities,
but which suffered by being dragged
out almost beyond belief.
The music was 'way above par.
"Waiting for You" and "Red-headed
Man," already mentioned, were
catchy tunes with clever lyrics, and
the chorus numbers were good. All
in all, a satisfying show with the
Holvenston direction getting the
most out of the good things and
salvaging something out of those not
so good.
