# OFFICERS REPORT NO SMASH-UPS IN BIG GAME TRAFFIC
## 
### 
Not one red berry bush on Palm
Drive was broken in thÂ£ Big Game
traffic which was the largest in Ihe
history of Stanford University. The
22,000 cars which jammed the cam
pus surrounding the stadium were
so well handled both in entering
and leaving the University grounds
that not one accident was reported
to Gordon Davis, campus traffic of
ficer.
Davis stated that 30 state patrol
men aided the local police force in
handling the traffic. These men
wore stationed along the Peninsula
highway north as far as San Fian
cisco and south as far as San Jose.
An inspector was in charge of the
patrolmen.
"Of course," Davis commented,
"there was the usual fender rubbing
and scratching, but there was no
major accident reported. The situa
tion was so well managed that I
turned on the traffic signals at Ihe
main highway intersection at o
o'clock."
Discounting the time it took for
people to get to their cars after the
game was over, the actual clearing
of cars from the campus took less
than an hour.
"Another feature of the Big Game
traffic was I hat everybody quickly
found their cars," Davis pointed out.
"Usually there arc a score of people
who cannot remember where they
left their cars. They are so anxious
to get into the Stadium that they
forget to note where the car was
parked.
