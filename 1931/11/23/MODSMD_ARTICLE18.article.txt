# Poor Blocking Wrecks Indian Scoring Drive
## Wind Affects Kicks And Passes During Tilt 
### Merlyn Mayger 
Once in seven years.
Not an alibi, just another scrap
iof history that will eventually be
chalked up by the 6-0 score. Trying
, to reason why hi ihis little tragedy
is like poking one's nose around in
j a mouldy coffin, or reading tomb
; stone epitaphs on a dreary Sunday
i afternoon.
Getting itno the exact mechanics
iof the game, California scored be
| cause: they took Stanford's ends
j out at will. Their interference was
! compact and effective.
Poor Blocking
Probably the weakest spot in the
i home team was blocking. It was
haphazard, listless, sloppy. At times
j it looked as if the Bears had eleven
; aggressive men on the field, while
| Stanford had an inspired few at
j tempting to stop a magic type ol
high-school ball.
For certain windy reasons the ball
I was hard to pass or catch. Witness
j the referee holding the ball between
plays. But Ihis could hardly mean
| the whole difference.
Final Drive
The last futile drive and passing
! attack the Indians made looked like
i a real Warner team going places on
j any Saturday afternoon. Sixty min
â€¢ utes of half that much drive would
| have meant worlds to the Indians,
j but Saturday gave them a respect-
I able defense, with their poorest of
fense that equalled California's first
downs, but unluckily placed the
first downs a bit too far from the
| goal line.
Meanwhile the team rolls East to
'Dartmouth, with one last chance to
; redeem itself. Wire reports indicate
j that while several Indians were
| badly banged up Saturday, they will
all be ready to face the Hanover
I eleven.
