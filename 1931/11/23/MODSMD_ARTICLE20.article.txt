### LOWELL COX 
Morale (5, Stanford 0.
Possessing that vital spark that has been lacking other years, a savage
Gold Bear came over the mountain Saturday to snap a seven-year Car
dinal winning streak. Morale and a lighting demon answering to the name
of Hank Schaldach ganged up on Stanford to wrest away a six-to-nothing
victory, California's first since the last of the great "wonder teams" look
a 9-to-0 game in 192:5.
Just one touchdown, six points, that Bear eleven rolled up, hut it was
enough. Just six points early in the second quarter, and it didn't look
like a great deal. Six points at half time still didn't worry Stanford sup
porters. Six points in the third quarter looking more important. Six
points looming larger and larger as the final period wore on. Six points
being threatened as the Big Red Machine, too late, made a last desperate
drive down the lield. Six points winning the game as Lee Valianos

intercepted Aliens long pass just
| before the gun blasted Stanford's
suddenly raised hopes.
California Determined
It was a cocky, determined Cali
' fornia team "Navy Bill" Ingram .sent
S into his first Big Game—a team that
: had work to do and was sure it
j could do it.
They took the situation into their
i hands early in the game and kept
things in control for most of the
i afternoon. The Indians launched an
early drive that carried them to Iho
: California 30-yard line, before they
: lost the ball on downs. But on the
first play Schaldach quick-kicked
j far over Hardy's head to send the
; ball out of bounds on the Stanford
; 14-yard line. Stanford was in the
j hole and didn't gel out until those
| fatal six points were on the score-
I board..
1 After an exchange of punts, Cali
j fornia took the ball on Stanford's "5.
Four times Schaldach smacked
the Indian line and came up with a
j first down on the 23-yard marker.
! Stanford took time out and Grey
! went in for Hand to bolster the left
| side of the Cardinal wall. Grey
| smeared the next play, but Scnal
| dach then dropped back to send a
I vital pass to Joe Smith, who made it
i first down on the Stanford 11-yard
! line.
More Schaldach
i Schaldach five, Schaldach one, and
■ Schaldach four more for a first
| down just a yard from paradise.
! Schaldach over right guard and the
1 California rooting section went
j crazy. Ehrhorn blocked Schaldach's
drop-kick, but as events turned out,
his efforts were in vain.
It was all Schaldach, that march,
1 just as it was all Schaldach the en
j tire afternoon. They took him out
i of the game late in the fourth quar
! ter, and 88,000 gave him a mighty
1 ovation. Demonstrating the value of
J Schaldach, the Bears became im
potent when Valianos replaced him.
I The spark plug of the team, he
kicked, passed, and ran his eleven
to victory.
Stanford made one scoring threat
I near the end of the half, one at the
1 start of the last quarter, and another
; just before the final gun. After a
; unting duel between Schaldach and
l Afflerbaugh, the Indians took pos
session on the Bears' 46. A 15-yard
J holding penalty made it first down
on the California 31-yard marker.
| Allen, who had replaced Rintala,
] tossed a flat pass over center to
j Afflerbaugh, who should have
caught it, but didn't. Two line plays
collected five yards, and again Allen
passed. Neill couldn't get under it,
and Schaldach knocked it down
back of the goal line, ending the
threat.
Another Try
Jack HiUman, who hud started
the second halt, put the Curds in
scoring position at the close of the
third quarter with a beautiful 20-
yard run. On the first play of the
next period Caddel took a lateral
pass and raced up the sideline for a
first down on California s 13-yard
line. Here, however, u bad pass
from center lost 10 yards, and two
more plays were stopped.
Stanford then tried a bootleg play
which has worked perfectly in prac
tice, but which was hastily executed
and failed when it was needed most.
Hearts Leap
Hearts leaped into 88,000 throats
in the last minutes of play when it
looked as if Pop might pull another
game out of the fire. Corbus re
covered Gill's fumble on his own
43, and Allen came back into the
game to pass.
The Allen-to-Colvin combination
brought a first down, and a forward
lateral, Allen-to-Colvin, brought
another on the Bear 33-yard line.
Memories of 1924 and 1928 flashed
up, but it was the Bears' day to win.
Yalianos intercepted a long
third-down pass, and the War
ner jinx was broken. It was a
hard-fought battle which thrilled
the shivering thousands from
start to finish. Stanford had op
portunity to win, but Califor
nia's stubborn defense AND
Schaldach were too much for
the Cardinals.

Besides Schaldach, the Bears
had Rusty Gill, who was a bat
tling fool; Castro, one of the
best blocking backs on the field.
Joe Smith, who called the right
signals, and .Yledanich. Stone.
Saimnie Gill, Tozer, and Kan
some on the line.
The Bear could not be tooled
Saturday—and the Bear won. His
I pass defense, so bad in the St.
Mary's game, was good; his attack
i was simple but it was backed by a
new SPIRIT, a winning spirit.
Corbus Stars
For Stanford the best man on the
, field was Bill Corbus, who was in
the middle of every play and was
, half a line in himself. Another Cor
-1 bus on the left side of the forward
| wall, and Schaldach would not have
, made so many gains over that side.
The Indians tried hard, but some
how didn't click. Blocking was poor.
Passes were dropped when long
I gains were in sight, and there was
no MofTatt to keep things running
smoothly.
| Jack Hillman was a sensation, and
' looks to be next year's fullback. He
can pass, he can buck, and once he
I got away on a 20-yard run. Another
! time he raced after Schaldach, who
| had got away and into the clear, to
J nail him on ine Stanford 15-yard
I line after a 45-yard chase.
It was a tough game to lose, but
! the best Stanford could have got
] out of it was a scoreless tie.

Stanford made one scoring threat
I near the end of the half, one at the

; just before the final gun. After a
; unting duel between Schaldach and
l Afflerbaugh, the Indians took pos
session on the Bears' 46. A 15-yard
J holding penalty made it first down
on the California 31-yard marker.
| Allen, who had replaced Rintala,
] tossed a flat pass over center to
j Afflerbaugh, who should have
caught it, but didn't. Two line plays
collected five yards, and again Allen
passed. Neill couldn't get under it,
and Schaldach knocked it down
back of the goal line, ending the
threat.
Another Try
Jack HiUman, who hud started
the second halt, put the Curds in
scoring position at the close of the
third quarter with a beautiful 20-
yard run. On the first play of the
next period Caddel took a lateral
pass and raced up the sideline for a
first down on California s 13-yard
line. Here, however, u bad pass
from center lost 10 yards, and two
more plays were stopped.
Stanford then tried a bootleg play
which has worked perfectly in prac
tice, but which was hastily executed
and failed when it was needed most.
Hearts Leap
Hearts leaped into 88,000 throats

looked as if Pop might pull another
game out of the fire. Corbus re
covered Gill's fumble on his own
43, and Allen came back into the
game to pass.
The Allen-to-Colvin combination
brought a first down, and a forward
lateral, Allen-to-Colvin, brought
another on the Bear 33-yard line.
Memories of 1924 and 1928 flashed
up, but it was the Bears' day to win.
Yalianos intercepted a long
third-down pass, and the War

hard-fought battle which thrilled
the shivering thousands from
start to finish. Stanford had op
portunity to win, but Califor
nia's stubborn defense AND
Schaldach were too much for
the Cardinals.

Besides Schaldach, the Bears
had Rusty Gill, who was a bat
tling fool; Castro, one of the
best blocking backs on the field.
Joe Smith, who called the right
signals, and .Yledanich. Stone.
Saimnie Gill, Tozer, and Kan
some on the line.

For Stanford the best man on the
, field was Bill Corbus, who was in
the middle of every play and was
, half a line in himself. Another Cor

Possessing that vital spark that has been lacking other years, a savage
Gold Bear came over the mountain Saturday to snap a seven-year Car

of Hank Schaldach ganged up on Stanford to wrest away a six-to-nothing
victory, California's first since the last of the great "wonder teams" look
a 9-to-0 game in 192:5.
Just one touchdown, six points, that Bear eleven rolled up, hut it was
enough. Just six points early in the second quarter, and it didn't look
like a great deal. Six points at half time still didn't worry Stanford sup
porters. Six points in the third quarter looking more important. Six
points looming larger and larger as the final period wore on. Six points

Just one touchdown, six points, that Bear eleven rolled up, hut it was
enough. Just six points early in the second quarter, and it didn't look

things in control for most of the
i afternoon. The Indians launched an
early drive that carried them to Iho

first play Schaldach quick-kicked
j far over Hardy's head to send the

Another Try
Jack HiUman, who hud started
the second halt, put the Curds in
scoring position at the close of the
third quarter with a beautiful 20-

; just before the final gun. After a

collected five yards, and again Allen
passed. Neill couldn't get under it,
and Schaldach knocked it down
back of the goal line, ending the
threat.
Another Try
Jack HiUman, who hud started
the second halt, put the Curds in
scoring position at the close of the
third quarter with a beautiful 20-
yard run. On the first play of the
next period Caddel took a lateral
pass and raced up the sideline for a
first down on California s 13-yard
line. Here, however, u bad pass
from center lost 10 yards, and two
more plays were stopped.
Stanford then tried a bootleg play
which has worked perfectly in prac

and failed when it was needed most.
Hearts Leap
Hearts leaped into 88,000 throats

looked as if Pop might pull another

portunity to win, but Califor

Schaldach were too much for
the Cardinals.

Besides Schaldach, the Bears
had Rusty Gill, who was a bat

best blocking backs on the field.
Joe Smith, who called the right
signals, and .Yledanich. Stone.
Saimnie Gill, Tozer, and Kan
some on the line.
The Bear could not be tooled
Saturday—and the Bear won. His

Corbus Stars
For Stanford the best man on the
, field was Bill Corbus, who was in
the middle of every play and was
, half a line in himself. Another Cor

Morale (5, Stanford 0.
Possessing that vital spark that has been lacking other years, a savage
Gold Bear came over the mountain Saturday to snap a seven-year Car
dinal winning streak. Morale and a lighting demon answering to the name
of Hank Schaldach ganged up on Stanford to wrest away a six-to-nothing
victory, California's first since the last of the great "wonder teams" look
a 9-to-0 game in 192:5.
Just one touchdown, six points, that Bear eleven rolled up, hut it was
enough. Just six points early in the second quarter, and it didn't look
like a great deal. Six points at half time still didn't worry Stanford sup
porters. Six points in the third quarter looking more important. Six
points looming larger and larger as the final period wore on. Six points
being threatened as the Big Red Machine, too late, made a last desperate
drive down the lield. Six points winning the game as Lee Valianos

intercepted Aliens long pass just
| before the gun blasted Stanford's
suddenly raised hopes.
California Determined
It was a cocky, determined Cali

S into his first Big Game—a team that
: had work to do and was sure it
j could do it.
They took the situation into their
i hands early in the game and kept
things in control for most of the
i afternoon. The Indians launched an
early drive that carried them to Iho
: California 30-yard line, before they
: lost the ball on downs. But on the
first play Schaldach quick-kicked
j far over Hardy's head to send the
; ball out of bounds on the Stanford
; 14-yard line. Stanford was in the
j hole and didn't gel out until those
| fatal six points were on the score-
