Morale (5, Stanford 0.
Possessing that vital spark that has been lacking other years, a savage
Gold Bear came over the mountain Saturday to snap a seven-year Car
dinal winning streak. Morale and a lighting demon answering to the name
of Hank Schaldach ganged up on Stanford to wrest away a six-to-nothing
victory, California's first since the last of the great "wonder teams" look
a 9-to-0 game in 192:5.
Just one touchdown, six points, that Bear eleven rolled up, hut it was
enough. Just six points early in the second quarter, and it didn't look
like a great deal. Six points at half time still didn't worry Stanford sup
porters. Six points in the third quarter looking more important. Six
points looming larger and larger as the final period wore on. Six points
being threatened as the Big Red Machine, too late, made a last desperate
drive down the lield. Six points winning the game as Lee Valianos

intercepted Aliens long pass just
| before the gun blasted Stanford's
suddenly raised hopes.
California Determined
It was a cocky, determined Cali
' fornia team "Navy Bill" Ingram .sent
S into his first Big Game—a team that
: had work to do and was sure it
j could do it.
They took the situation into their
i hands early in the game and kept
things in control for most of the
i afternoon. The Indians launched an
early drive that carried them to Iho
: California 30-yard line, before they
: lost the ball on downs. But on the
first play Schaldach quick-kicked
j far over Hardy's head to send the
; ball out of bounds on the Stanford
; 14-yard line. Stanford was in the
j hole and didn't gel out until those
| fatal six points were on the score-
I board..
1 After an exchange of punts, Cali
j fornia took the ball on Stanford's "5.
Four times Schaldach smacked
the Indian line and came up with a
j first down on the 23-yard marker.
! Stanford took time out and Grey
! went in for Hand to bolster the left
| side of the Cardinal wall. Grey
| smeared the next play, but Scnal
| dach then dropped back to send a
I vital pass to Joe Smith, who made it
i first down on the Stanford 11-yard
! line.
More Schaldach
i Schaldach five, Schaldach one, and
■ Schaldach four more for a first
| down just a yard from paradise.
! Schaldach over right guard and the
1 California rooting section went
j crazy. Ehrhorn blocked Schaldach's
drop-kick, but as events turned out,
his efforts were in vain.
It was all Schaldach, that march,
1 just as it was all Schaldach the en
j tire afternoon. They took him out
i of the game late in the fourth quar
! ter, and 88,000 gave him a mighty
1 ovation. Demonstrating the value of
J Schaldach, the Bears became im
potent when Valianos replaced him.
I The spark plug of the team, he
kicked, passed, and ran his eleven
to victory.
Stanford made one scoring threat
I near the end of the half, one at the
1 start of the last quarter, and another
; just before the final gun. After a
; unting duel between Schaldach and
l Afflerbaugh, the Indians took pos
session on the Bears' 46. A 15-yard
J holding penalty made it first down
on the California 31-yard marker.
| Allen, who had replaced Rintala,
] tossed a flat pass over center to
j Afflerbaugh, who should have
caught it, but didn't. Two line plays
collected five yards, and again Allen
passed. Neill couldn't get under it,
and Schaldach knocked it down
