# STANFORD'S "NEXT YEAR"
## 
### 
Wilhoul alibis, without complaints, Stanford students,
and the Daily in particular, will acknowledge "California
Bill" Ingram as a great and inspirational coach for his feat
in turning out a Rig Game winner in one short year.
Stanford fought like fury and lost. The Indian rooters
could have asked no more, and two splendid goal line
stands in the closing minutes bear witness to the fact that
Stanford's football team gave everything it had.
It has been "next year" for California these past seven
years. Now it is "next year" for Stanfordâ€”next year for
the second crack at the Rears and a Class A football coach.
