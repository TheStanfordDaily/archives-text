Which should come first —the welfare of a college ath
lete or the gate receipts for athletic spectacles?
"Dink" Templeton, Stanford track coach, thinks his
athletes are entitled to tirst consideration, and so he has
announced that Stanford track men who have a chance to
qualify for the American Olympic Games team will not be
allowed to run in the ICIA meet at Rerkeley the week
previous.
The situation is this: The ICI A meet, to be held on the
west coast for the first time, was originally scheduled for
July I and 2, with the final Olympic Games tryouts to be
run otT here July 15 and 1(>. To bring the meet to the Uni
versity of California new track, however, Graduate Mana
ger William Monahan of the Ray institution was forced
to guarantee the IC4A some $65,000.
Monahan, feeling that a meet held on July 1 and 2
would lose some patronage because of the exodus of
Fourth of July vacationers, succeeded in having the affair
moved up a week. Of course, Monahan's viewpoint is eas
ily understood. The new Rerkeley stadium seats only be
tween 20,000 and 25,000 spectators. Unless a rather high
price, around two or three dollars, is charged for admis
sion, Monahan will not make his guarantee.
But what of the track star? Templeton (if he doesn't
know, who does?) is emphatic in declaring that it would
be impossible to bring an athlete to the peak of compe
tition form twice in six days. The strain will be doubly
hard on those Eastern runners who must make a trans
continental journey before competing.
The IC4A meet will count as an Olympic Games semi
final trials, the men placing being eligible to compete in the
final trials here. But on July 1 and 2, track men in organi
zations not affiliated with the ICIA can enter the western
semi-final trials held at Long Reach, and have almost two
full weeks before entering the finals. To Long Reach, then,
will go the pick of the Stanford team, no concerted effort
being made to win the collegiate title.
Other college track coaches have not yet publicly de
clared their attitude on the question, but one doesn't have
to be a coach to realize that a man can better perform up
to his capabilities if he has a week's rest between two such
meets. If those coaches do agree with Templeton, they
must either sacrifice their men for the Olympic Games or
withdraw them from one of the meets. Most of them prob
ably hold the Games above the college meet and will act
accordingly, to the disadvantage of the IC4A.
The only logical solution is to move the IC4A date back
to July 1 and 2 and let Monahan rely on the novelty of the
coast's first such contest to fill the stadium.

to be a coach to realize that a man can better perform up
to his capabilities if he has a week's rest between two such
meets. If those coaches do agree with Templeton, they
must either sacrifice their men for the Olympic Games or
withdraw them from one of the meets. Most of them prob
ably hold the Games above the college meet and will act
accordingly, to the disadvantage of the IC4A.
The only logical solution is to move the IC4A date back
to July 1 and 2 and let Monahan rely on the novelty of the
coast's first such contest to fill the stadium.
Which should come first —the welfare of a college ath
lete or the gate receipts for athletic spectacles?
"Dink" Templeton, Stanford track coach, thinks his
athletes are entitled to tirst consideration, and so he has
announced that Stanford track men who have a chance to
qualify for the American Olympic Games team will not be
allowed to run in the ICIA meet at Rerkeley the week
previous.
The situation is this: The ICI A meet, to be held on the
west coast for the first time, was originally scheduled for
July I and 2, with the final Olympic Games tryouts to be
run otT here July 15 and 1(>. To bring the meet to the Uni
versity of California new track, however, Graduate Mana
ger William Monahan of the Ray institution was forced
to guarantee the IC4A some $65,000.
Monahan, feeling that a meet held on July 1 and 2
would lose some patronage because of the exodus of
Fourth of July vacationers, succeeded in having the affair
moved up a week. Of course, Monahan's viewpoint is eas
ily understood. The new Rerkeley stadium seats only be
tween 20,000 and 25,000 spectators. Unless a rather high
price, around two or three dollars, is charged for admis
sion, Monahan will not make his guarantee.
But what of the track star? Templeton (if he doesn't
know, who does?) is emphatic in declaring that it would
be impossible to bring an athlete to the peak of compe
tition form twice in six days. The strain will be doubly
hard on those Eastern runners who must make a trans
continental journey before competing.
The IC4A meet will count as an Olympic Games semi
final trials, the men placing being eligible to compete in the
final trials here. But on July 1 and 2, track men in organi
zations not affiliated with the ICIA can enter the western
semi-final trials held at Long Reach, and have almost two
full weeks before entering the finals. To Long Reach, then,
will go the pick of the Stanford team, no concerted effort
being made to win the collegiate title.
Other college track coaches have not yet publicly de
clared their attitude on the question, but one doesn't have
to be a coach to realize that a man can better perform up
to his capabilities if he has a week's rest between two such
meets. If those coaches do agree with Templeton, they
must either sacrifice their men for the Olympic Games or
withdraw them from one of the meets. Most of them prob
