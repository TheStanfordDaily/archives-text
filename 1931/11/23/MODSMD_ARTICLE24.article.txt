# PITY THE POOR GRID STAR
## 
### 
Because the football team has suffered ten consecutive
defeats, the co-eds of Boston University recently informed
the varsity gridders by a letter that they would neither
speak to nor make dates with them until they win a foot
hall game, according to a news report.
Whether the co-eds viewed this decree in the light of a
punishment for the football men because they have failed
to ring up a victory yet this season or an attempt to aid the
gridmen in keeping training by refusing them dates, the
report failed to state.
Imagine the turmoil into which the Big Red Machine
would be thrown if the "."iOO" laid down such a law.
