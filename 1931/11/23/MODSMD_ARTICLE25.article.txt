HE CAME; HE SAW; AND lIE LEFT

The pronoun, "he," in this case, j
refers to Grandi, minister to
Mussolini. It's too bad the Big Boy,
himself, couldn't have come; hut
that is one peculiarity of a dictator
ship—he must dictate 24 hours a
day, every day in the week, because
if he ever stops, the people are
likely to get the idea that he is un
necessary or, even more likely,
some other up-and-coming is apt
to assume power.
No one knows how much good
Mr. Grandi's visit will have. Every
body hopes that, perhaps, something
will come of it. Probably the real
cause for both Laval's and Grandi's
visit is the coming disarmament
conference. Ever since Germany has
been forced to disarm, the two
stumbling blocks to cutting arma
ments have been France and Italy.
France "cannot" disarm for a great
number of reasons; and Italy can't
disarm for one reason —France.
The desire of a nation to disarm
seems to vary directly with its. pros
perity. During the summer Musso
lini agreed to cut his army to 10,000
if others would cut similarly. Russia
has proposed complete abolition of
armaments while France has stood
pat. And that is just about the way
the three of them stack up eco
nomically. With a depression that is
world-wide, Italy and Russia are
almost suffocating down in the

| trough of the depression where the
j atmosphere is decidedly too dense.
I France is flying high and does not
have any feeling that she is falling;
; so it is only natural to expect that
! she wants to keep her large army.
The result is that when all the
i nations meet to disarm, France looks
like a war ogre. The sons of the Tri
| color dislike this, and so Premier
Laval came to America. The Black
| Shirts don't know what Hoover
| promised Laval, but they want two
of them. The fact that these two
! countries have come to the U.S.; and
i the fact that U.S. favors disarma
ment would seem to indicate that
! in all probability, the next disarma
! ment conference at Geneva may do
j something besides scrap a few blue
j prints and limit future increase of
j armaments. —Abe Mellinkoff.
We're Sorry: Our information was
i wrong. People did not pay 25 cents
to see the Big Game Rally as was
! stated Friday. THEY WERE AD
! MIITED FREE. More is the pity,
i then. If the students' rally was
j jammed with Outlanders in order
! to raise money for student projects,
j the affair might be excused on
grounds of commercialism or finan
cial exigency; but just to let the
people in on free tickets is without
I any defense —even so flimsy as the
' need for money.
