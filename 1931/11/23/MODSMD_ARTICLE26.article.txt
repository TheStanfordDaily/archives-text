POSSESSED—At the New Stanford i
Theatre.
We had heard from apparently
reliable sources that Joan Crawford
was through in every sense of the
word. That source of information
must have been in the last category
of unreliability. She does a piece of !
powerful acting in "Possessed"
which would indicate that she is in
the prime of her acting ability rather
than at the end of it. The picture
itself, the story of the small-town
girl who intended to get the money,
jewelry, and clothes that she cov
eted willy-nilly and regardless of
commonly accepted morals, is good.
It has sparkles of sophisticated wit
throughout and rises to sheer drama
at the end.
Clark Gable, as the wealthy young
lawyer who took the poor country
girl under his muificent wing, lived
up to his excellent showing in pre
vious pictures. The rest of the cast
do their jobs well even though some
of the characters are slightly over- !
drawn.
An excellent feature with shorts I
that are not even worthy of remark. I

SNAKES OF THE WORLD — By
Raymond L. Ditmars. Macmillan,
New York, 1931. (At the Stanford
Bookstore. $0.00)
If you care for snakes, and even
if you have only a cursory interest.
A scientific book, but for the lay
man. The technical terms are few,
and are bearable due to a clear,
lucid style.

i It deals interestingly with poison
| ous and non-poisonous x*eptiles of
all parts of the world, and it con
! tains some awe-inspiring photo
! graphs.
A section on what to do for the
| victim of a snake-bite until the
| doctor comes is illuminating, but
: disappointing, as it seems that whis
! key applied internally is of practi
: cally no value. —R.M.
' THE CUBAN LOVE SONG—At the
Varsity Theatre.
If Lawrence Tibbett's singing were
all. if Lupe Velez's rumba were all,
if the pukka Cuban orchestra were
all, the show would be worth seeing.
Here we have the girl-I-left-be
! hind-me theme filmed in an exotic
j Cuban setting—at least as exotically
j Cuban as the imaginative creator,
jW. S. Van Dyke, and countless
■ tropical fruit trees could make
! Santa Monica Canyon. Only what
I appears to a Hollywood mind espe
! cially typical of Cuba is used for
| atmosphere and yet at that it's a
! whole lot less stereotyped than a
tourist's picture folder. The plot is
sufficiently whimsical anyway to
justify the glamorous Hollywood
settings.
A great deal of the dialogue, "two
or more persons conversing or rea
soning on some topic," is carried
out in song. The show is betwixt a
bona fide talkie and a musical com
| edy and as such is neither as con
j sistent as the one nor as tedious as
i the other—the explanation chari
j table but nevertheless true,
i —E.T.P.

SNAKES OF THE WORLD — By
Raymond L. Ditmars. Macmillan,
New York, 1931. (At the Stanford
Bookstore. $0.00)
If you care for snakes, and even
if you have only a cursory interest.
A scientific book, but for the lay
man. The technical terms are few,
and are bearable due to a clear,
lucid style.

i It deals interestingly with poison
| ous and non-poisonous x*eptiles of
all parts of the world, and it con
! tains some awe-inspiring photo
! graphs.
A section on what to do for the
| victim of a snake-bite until the
| doctor comes is illuminating, but
: disappointing, as it seems that whis
! key applied internally is of practi
: cally no value. —R.M.
' THE CUBAN LOVE SONG—At the
Varsity Theatre.
If Lawrence Tibbett's singing were
all. if Lupe Velez's rumba were all,
if the pukka Cuban orchestra were
all, the show would be worth seeing.
Here we have the girl-I-left-be
! hind-me theme filmed in an exotic
j Cuban setting—at least as exotically
j Cuban as the imaginative creator,
jW. S. Van Dyke, and countless
■ tropical fruit trees could make
! Santa Monica Canyon. Only what
I appears to a Hollywood mind espe
! cially typical of Cuba is used for
| atmosphere and yet at that it's a
! whole lot less stereotyped than a
tourist's picture folder. The plot is
sufficiently whimsical anyway to
justify the glamorous Hollywood
settings.
A great deal of the dialogue, "two
or more persons conversing or rea
soning on some topic," is carried
out in song. The show is betwixt a
bona fide talkie and a musical com
| edy and as such is neither as con
j sistent as the one nor as tedious as
i the other—the explanation chari
j table but nevertheless true,
i —E.T.P.
POSSESSED—At the New Stanford i
Theatre.
We had heard from apparently
reliable sources that Joan Crawford
was through in every sense of the
word. That source of information
must have been in the last category
of unreliability. She does a piece of !
powerful acting in "Possessed"
which would indicate that she is in
the prime of her acting ability rather
than at the end of it. The picture
itself, the story of the small-town
girl who intended to get the money,
jewelry, and clothes that she cov
eted willy-nilly and regardless of
commonly accepted morals, is good.
It has sparkles of sophisticated wit
throughout and rises to sheer drama
at the end.
Clark Gable, as the wealthy young
lawyer who took the poor country
girl under his muificent wing, lived
up to his excellent showing in pre
vious pictures. The rest of the cast
do their jobs well even though some
of the characters are slightly over- !
drawn.
An excellent feature with shorts I
that are not even worthy of remark. I
