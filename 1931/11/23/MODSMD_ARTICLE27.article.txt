# GERMANY PROHIBITS CHEMICAL BOOK SALE
## 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 22.â€”The govern
ment is considering the prohibition i
of the sale of a new book on ultra
poisonous gases, written by the j
chemical expert, Hugo Stolzberg, on
the grounds that it contains advice ;
which should not be in the hands oi j
laymen. The new book describes
the composition of poison gases, with
formulae so understandable even to
the lay mind that ordinary house
holders might concoct poisons.
