## THE 						AMATEUR SONG-WRITER TO HIS LADY 
### 
All day I long to sing a song
Endearing all your smiles.
My days are spent, my mind is lent
With thoughts as long as miles.
What can I find to say?
The moon above, then thoughts of
love,
Is older than the sky.
Stars always bring, so the bards
sing,
That tender kiss and sigh.
What can I find to say?
Let others sing of moons
And balmy nights in Junes.
I'll gather up the tunes
And give them all to you!
For love nests, dear, of any kind,
Aren't sweet enough for you.
Too wide the place, for our embrace
Beneath those skies of blue.
V/hat can I find to say?
A broken heart, if we should part,
Would take you from my sight,
And though your arms entwine with
charms,
We've missed the kiss each night.
Let others sing of moons
And balmy nights in Junes.
I'll gather up the tunes
And give them all to you!
All day I long to sing a song
Endearing all your smiles.

With thoughts as long as miles.
