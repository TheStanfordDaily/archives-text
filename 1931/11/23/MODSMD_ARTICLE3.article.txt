SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 23.
â€”San Francisco struggled out
of the covers along about noon
yesterday with more headaches
per capita than the city has
had since January 1, 1931.
Although Federal prohibition
agents did their best, with live
raids and eight arrests, they
admitted that the score against
them was considerably higher
than 6 to 0.
Up in front of the Hotel St.
Francis two agents noted a
man standing before his parked
automobile, hawking the liquor
which cheers to those entering
the hotel. .
The management of the St.
Francis was horrified to think
that anyone might have broken
the Nation's laws right in front
of their doors. They congratu
lated the agents on their
"pinch" and shuddered at the
Ihought that someone might
have purchased a bottle of li
quor and brought it into the
hotel.
