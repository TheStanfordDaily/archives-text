### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.â€”Senator
Howell's bill, conceived to make the
District of Columbia a "model dry
city," is to be presented to Congress
again during the coming session, the
Nebraska Republican announced to
day.
The Howell bill would authorize
police officers of the district to as
sist in prohibition enforcement, and
would authorize a fund of $2,000 to
be used to gain evidence. Another
provision that aroused great protest
was one pertaining to the search
warrants.
The Senate last year had the bill
under consideration on several oc
casions, but failed to reach a vote.
The House never considered the bill.
