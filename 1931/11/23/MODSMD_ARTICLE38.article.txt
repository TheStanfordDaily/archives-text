MADRID, Nov. 22. — Propaganda
has been called into play in the past
few weeks with intensified force.
There is talk of marshaling world
I opinion against a Sino-Japanese war
j by one of the most extensive propa
ganda campaigns yet proposed.
In England the press struck a re
i sponsive chord of every Briton's
heart, as election returns show, with
( the "Old-England"' campaign. There
, those appeals were to the conserva
tism which built the great British
| Empire and therefore lay close to
I the nation's heart.
Perhaps nowhere in the world has
j the value of propaganda been more
! clearly demonstrated in the past
j year than in Spain. For many years
j the Socialist party, which started
| with twenty-five members and to-
I day has millions enrolled in its trade
| unions and is the largest party in
the nation, continued verbal and
printed propaganda against the
j monarchistic regime.
