Oh, woe is us!
Back in 1923 Sports Editor Wil
liam Wright recorded a California
victory in the Big Game. It was his
distasteful task to tell how the Andy
Smith Bears blocked a punt and
scored a safety to win a bitter 9 to 0
struggle, adding another link to the
imposing chain of victories rung up
by the "wonder teams."
Came the dawn, and the advent
of Pop Warner. Came the classic
20 to 20 tie, and David Meikeljohn
could chronicle the first break in
the California winning streak — a
streak that had run for five long,
lean years.
Most fortunate of all was the Daily
grid scribe of 1925, with a 27 to 14
victory over the Blue and Gold to
rave about —the first in six years.
That started it all. Nibs Price
gave Carroll O'Meara a had
scare in 1928, but on Monday be
could record how a thrilling (
last-half drive tied the score, i
13 to 13.
Len Kullman capped the cli
max last year when he chalked
up that new record score, 41 to 0.
Now it is our miserable lot to
record the end of the fattest
winning streak in the history of
the Big Games—seven straight .
years marred only by two ties.
California G, Stanford 0. Oh,
woe is us!
Those paint-slinging Bears who
invaded the campus the other
morning were almost right at that
when they predicted a score of
California 13, Stanford 0.
But for one brilliant tackle by
Hillman, the younger, the score
would have been just that, or one
point less. Schaldach was away to
the races in the final quarter when
Jack nabbed him from behind to
save a certain touchdown.
Speaking of tackles, our nomina
tion for second best was Stone's Hy
ing leap that pinned Hardy on ihe
Stanford three-yard line late in the
first quarter. Schaldach's kick took
a bad bounce, and Spud, who had
been waiting for it to roll over the
goal line, grabbed it and attempted
to run. He appeared to have a clear
field for 15 yards or so, when the
California end came catapulting
through the air from nowhere in
particular to stop him cold.
She could hardly realize it
was true.
"Just think," she squealed,
"we won the BIG GAME! What
do you think of the navy now?"
"I don't know," a feminine
voice in the crowd responded.
"I never go out with sailors."

Oh, woe is us!
Back in 1923 Sports Editor Wil
liam Wright recorded a California
victory in the Big Game. It was his
distasteful task to tell how the Andy
Smith Bears blocked a punt and
scored a safety to win a bitter 9 to 0
struggle, adding another link to the
imposing chain of victories rung up
by the "wonder teams."
Came the dawn, and the advent
of Pop Warner. Came the classic
20 to 20 tie, and David Meikeljohn
could chronicle the first break in
the California winning streak — a
streak that had run for five long,
lean years.
Most fortunate of all was the Daily
grid scribe of 1925, with a 27 to 14
victory over the Blue and Gold to
rave about —the first in six years.
That started it all. Nibs Price
gave Carroll O'Meara a had
scare in 1928, but on Monday be
could record how a thrilling (
last-half drive tied the score, i
13 to 13.
Len Kullman capped the cli
max last year when he chalked
up that new record score, 41 to 0.
Now it is our miserable lot to
record the end of the fattest
winning streak in the history of
the Big Games—seven straight .
years marred only by two ties.
California G, Stanford 0. Oh,
woe is us!
Those paint-slinging Bears who
invaded the campus the other
morning were almost right at that
when they predicted a score of
California 13, Stanford 0.
But for one brilliant tackle by
Hillman, the younger, the score
would have been just that, or one
point less. Schaldach was away to
the races in the final quarter when
Jack nabbed him from behind to
save a certain touchdown.
Speaking of tackles, our nomina
tion for second best was Stone's Hy
ing leap that pinned Hardy on ihe
Stanford three-yard line late in the
first quarter. Schaldach's kick took
a bad bounce, and Spud, who had
been waiting for it to roll over the
goal line, grabbed it and attempted
to run. He appeared to have a clear
field for 15 yards or so, when the
California end came catapulting
through the air from nowhere in
particular to stop him cold.
She could hardly realize it
was true.
"Just think," she squealed,
"we won the BIG GAME! What
do you think of the navy now?"
"I don't know," a feminine
voice in the crowd responded.
"I never go out with sailors."
