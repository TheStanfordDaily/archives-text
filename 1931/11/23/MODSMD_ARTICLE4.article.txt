California's star back, Hank Schaldach, rushes over (he goal line
from the one-yard stripe for the only score of the day. The touch
down came in the second quarter after a determined march by ihe
Bears. FJill Marks, number .'52 (center), is about to tackle Schaldach,

while number 1(5, Ernie Caddcll,(halfback), comes lip fast in order
to help his teammate. However, the momentum of the Bear star
carried him over the line.
