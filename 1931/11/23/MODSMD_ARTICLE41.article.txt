QUINCY, Nov. 22. (JP)â€”A high
way contsruction crew working on
the Marysville-Beckwith highway
got a surprise when the steam
shovel ploughed into a hillside near
Spanish ranch and came forth with
a wriggling mass. It contained more
than 200 snakes, believed to have
gone into hibernating quarters for
the winter.
