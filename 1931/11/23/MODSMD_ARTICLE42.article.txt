# Card Booters Take Third From California, 3-1
## CARDINALS EXHIBIT TOP-NOTCH SOCCER IN SECOND PERIOD Hearn Chalks Up Two Goals While Mearns Scores Another 
### 
■—
Fighting a determined Berkeley
j Bear as well as a high wind that at
i times approached gale-like propor
-1 tions, Stanford's varsity soccer team
j came out of Saturday's battle on the
long end of a 3-1 score, to make it
i three straight over the California
i outfit.
j Stanford scored first when Bill
I Mearns, outside right, took a nice
i pass from Captain Falk and drove
it through the uprights. With the
1 period half gone, Hearn took the
I ball on the rebound from a mixup
I in front of the Bear goal and banged
!it through for the Cards' second
| score. His shot was one of the
; nicest pieces of work seen on the
j campus this season.
Smart Scores for U.C.
The fans had hardly settled them
| selves for what seemed like a high
scoring record for the Indians, be
| fore Captain Smart of California
; broke loose- on a penalty kick and
! drove the ball past Goalie Webster
' for the Bears' only score of the day.
Stanford's last tally was the result
of a clever "center" by Mearns, a
I head by Hearn, and another by the
j California goalie, with the Cards
' getting credit for the score.
i The second half, despite the wind,
I treated the shivering spectators to
{the best soccer seen on the campus
| field for many seasons.
i If there was any superiority
j shown in this period, credit should
go to the Indians. The gale made
scores almost out of the question,
but Stanford had the greater num-
J ber of chances.
Maloney Praises Team
Coach Harry Maloney, taking time
I off between trips East to watch his
: charges perform, declared that Stan
' ford's play in the second period was
| by far the best performance of the
year in conference soccer circles.
With a record of seven victories
' and one tie, Stanford will close the
j season December 5, against the
j powerful San Francisco University
| Hilltoppers. Although the Cards
I have won the league as far as per
centage goes, they still have to take
I the S.F.U. team into camp to keep
their record clear of defeats.
Possessing the first unbeaten soc
cer outfit in recent years, and feel
j ing that some recognition of this
record is in order, Farm soccer fans
have already begun to formulate
plans for sending the squad into
the Northwest during the Christmas
holidays. This depends, of course, on
the ability of the team to win the
last game of the season, from the
Hilltoppers, in December.
