The feature game of this after

will find the defending Sigma Chis
meeting the unbeaten Alpha Delts j
in a contest that will decide the j
winner of League 11. Although the ,
Sigma Chis are the defending i
champions, the Alpha Delts have j
looked to be of equal strength in j
the games played to date, and the I
battle between the famous "sleeper" '
play and the equally notorious Nay- j
lon running attack should indeed j
be royal.
The Phi Delts have a chance to j
cinch the championship of League I i
this afternoon when they meet Ihe i
A.K.L.'s. The latter outfit is at pivs- i
ent in second place, and a victory
for them would again tie up the '
league.
