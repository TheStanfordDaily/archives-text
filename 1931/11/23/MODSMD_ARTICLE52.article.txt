With eighteen holes still left to
play off in the annual Stanford Golf
Club Championship finals, Lex Ehr
man and Vernon Pearson, finalists,
will meet this week to decide the
final outcome.
Because of his illness Dink Tem
pleton, who was the medalist, was
undoubtedly kept from being a con
tender in the finals. Stanford's track
mentor was considered the class of
the tournament in the advance
done.
