# ANSON WEEKS IS MAIN ATTRACTION OF WEEKLY MEET
## Track-Fest Will Be Run Off Tomorrow At 4: 15 O'Clock 
### Dick Strouse 
In order not to hurt Anson Weeks'
feelings and due to the muddy con
dition of the track, last Fridays
practice track meet was held in the
Basketball Pavilion instead of on
the old oval. The times were uni
versally slow, due to the crowded
condition of the course.
One new mark was established
during the afternoon: the record of
31 consecutive dance-steps without
a cut-in and with the same popular
girl that was set in 1928 at a Roble
jolly-up was surpassed by 3' steps.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
the less socially inclined trackmen
will be given a chance to display
their superiority when the old oval
again becomes the scene of a prac
tice meet. With the exception of the
sprints and hurdles, all races will
be run at three-quarters of their
regular distances.
