OXFORD. England, Nov. 22. (/Piâ€” |
Sir Francis James Wylic, secretary
to the Rhodes trustees, suggests
that American Rhodes scholars sup
plement their scholarship funds of I
nearly $2,000 a year by at least
$125 and preferably more.
There have been increasing evi- !
dences, Sir Francis says, that j:he j
amount provided for each Rhodes
scholar under the will of the dia- j
mond king, Cecil Rhodes, is insuffi- |
cient.
"Every year one or two men tell i
me they have managed on the schol- j
arship," Sir Francis says. "But for
one who takes a normal share n
athletics and social life a little more
is necessary."
