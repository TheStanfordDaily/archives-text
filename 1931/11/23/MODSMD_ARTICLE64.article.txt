# THANKSGIVING THEME OF SUNDAY SERMON
## 
### 
The true meaning of Thanksgiving
was the theme of Or. David Charles
Gardner's sermon yesterday in the
Stanford Memorial Church.
He stressed the point that ll.is
year more thany any other Vve
should observe the real spirit of
Thanksgiving by giving to those less
fortunate than we. In this time of
depression, as never before, there
is a chance for a real Thanksgiving.
