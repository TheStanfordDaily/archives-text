MOSCOW, Nov. 22. (/P)â€”Japan
was sharply warned today by the
communist newspaper Pravda to
cease what it termed an anti-soviet
campaign in connection with Man
churia.
"Soviet Russia's peace policy does
not mean it will allow efforts to
harm the interests of socialist con
struction to go unpunished," said
the newspaper.
'"Let Tokyo, Washington and
Paris not forget this."
Strife Efforts Told
Asserting it was no secret that
certain Japanese circles were seek
ing to complicate Japanese-soviet
relations, the Communist party or
gan said:
"The Japanese military cannot
gratify us by assurance alone. The
Japanese government must confirm
by action its peaceful intentions to
ward the soviet Union and first in
tercept the anti-soviet campaign."
An attempt to draw an analogy
between the present conflict and the
Chinese-Russian 'embroglio in 1929
was described by Pravda as "only
an effort to indicate that the soviet
government was indebted to Japa
nese imperialism, which gives a new
pretense to prolong the anti-soviet
campaign.
Continuous efforts of imperialist
powers to set up in China the bogev
of an "anarchy" created by soviet
Russia and rumors of soviet sup
port of Chinese Generals, the news
paper said, were "fabricated to di
vert attention from imperialistic
plundering of Manchuria."
Falsity. Drive Hit
"Notwithstanding our previous

I clear declarations denying such
J provocating reports, the campaign
iof fabrications against soviet Rus
| sia continues to flourish in Japan,"
'the newspaper ' added. ,
Seeing anti-soviet plans as un
, doubtedly occupying an important
i place in the Paris sessions of the
' League of Nations council, Pravda
said the League was making an ef
; fort to hide an imperialistic division
Icf Chirta by supporting Japan in
Manchuria on a pretense of com
\ batting anarchy in China.
Stresses Slaughter
"Meanwhile, the Japanese mili
j tary is killing thousands of Chinese,
'plundering Chinese cities, destroy
; ing railway lines and appointing its
i own governments, all in the name
jof establishing order," the news-
I paper charged.
"Who asked Japan to establish a
| protectorate in Manchuria?"
