# BARRETT DRAMA READING TONIGHT
## Mrs. Farrington Interprets Popular Play Here 
### 
i Mrs. Guy Farrington's rare skill
i as an interpreter of plays will be
j demonstrated this evening when
! she reads "'The Barretts of Wi»..pole
1 Street" in the Assembly Hall at /:30
| o'clock. This Rudolph Besier play is
' the one in which Katherine Cornell
i has been starring in New York for
j the past year.
Mrs. Farrington is said to present
the life and characteristics of h'eT
characters with an artistic ability
; so fine that the complete illusion of
a stage production is given the audi
j ence. Critics who have witnessed
| her performances write enthusiasti
! cally about her remarkable control
| of voice, her delightful sense of
humor, and her perfect conception
j of dramatic climax.
Browning Romance
"The Barretts of Wimpole Street,"
I which caused considerable stir in
both London and New York, is a
i family chronicle based on two ro
mances—that of Elizabeth Barrett
; and Robert Browning and that of
i her sister and a soldier. The play
' earned three-quarters of a million
i dollars in England and has brought
i in over a million in New York al
ready. In this country it was the
| outstanding hit of last season and
is still leading in popularity this
! season.
j The San Francisco Argonaut said
of Mrs. Farrington, "Her compre
; hcnsion of the moods and mental
peculiarities of her characters to
gether with her fine tonal shadings
i and subtleties of histronic projec
' tion make the reading a thing of
j vividness."
No Charge
Mrs. Farrington read "Journey's
End" here two years ago, and "The
I Outsider" last year. After the latter
occasion, the Stanford Daily re
| marked that "through Mrs. Farring
i ton's characterizations her audience
j found moving, breathing actors on
t the empty stage."
This reading is one of the regular
Tuesday evening series of programs
presented by the Committee on
Public Exercises; consequently there
will be no admission charge. After
j the reading the A.W.S. guest com
i mittee will entertain Mrs. Farring
! ton at an informal gathering for
| coffee in the Women's Clubhouse,
to which both men and women stu
dents are invited.
