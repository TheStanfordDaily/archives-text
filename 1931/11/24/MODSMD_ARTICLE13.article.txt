# WATSON, DAVIS SUGAR PROFITS RECEIVE AIRING
## Many National Political Figures Said To Be Cash Investors 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 .—(JP)—
The searchlight of senatorial inquiry
was turned today on the 1928 stock
investments of two of the Senate's
own members, Watson of Indiana
and Davis of Pennsylvania, disclos
ing evidence that both had made
"paper profits" on sugar stock they
purchased on credit.
At the time of the purchases, Da
vis still was secretary of labor in
Coolidge's cabinet and Watson was
a candidate against Hoover for the
Republican presidential nomination.
The evidence did not show that
either actually turned his paper
profit into cash, both taking securi
ties instead. It was testified that in
"*29 the sugar intercuts from whom
N stock was acquired became ac
t. in advocating a higher sugar
ta> I
Stocks Worthless
Watson, who is the Republican
Senate leader, said in a statement
tonight that his transaction was
purely a private matter, that neither
the non-interest-bearing note he
gave in payment, nor the securities
he received as a profit had any pres
ent value, and tha-t the score re
mained "nothing-to-nothing." Sen
ator Davis was absent from Wash
ington.
The testimony was given before
the Senate Lobby Committee, .which
had been called to investigate a re
port of a $100,000 payment to a Sen
ator by lobbyists for a sugar tariff
boost.
Records Lacking
A committee investigator, John
Holland, said on the stand that he
had found evidence Watson and Da
vis each was at one time about
$8,000 to the good on paper on deals
engineered by B. G. Dahlberg, presi
dent of a number of sugar compa
nies. Holland also s-nid lie had beeYi'
told by one of Dahlbei-g's associates
of a conversation about sending $10,-
000 to Davis, but could find no rec
ord any such payment really was
made.
The investigator further asserted
that Former Governor Alfred E.
Smith, John J. Raskob, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee,
and Senator Moses of New Hamp
shire, were investors in Dahlberg's
companies, but had paid cash for
their purchases.
