SAN ANTONIO. Tex., Nov. 23,</F)
—Seven Democrats and one Repub
lican, candidates for the congression
al seat of the late Harry M. Wurz
bach of Seguin, Republican, tonight
drew the attention of state and na
tional political leaders.
Upon results of the special elec
tion tomorrow in the 14th Congres
sional District perhaps hinged the
balance of power between closely
divided Democratic and Republican
forces in the House of Representa
tives.
Democratic leaders had pleaded
vainly with the eight members of
their party seeking the post to agree
upon one man lest a split vote en
abled one of the two Republicans
to win.
Two last-minute withdrawals to
day left eight candidates in the field,
seven Democrats and one Repub
lican.
