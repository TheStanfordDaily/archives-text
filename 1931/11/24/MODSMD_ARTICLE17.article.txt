# KFRC Schedules Harvard Debate For Noon Friday
## National Hook-Up To Make Debating History 
### 
Twelve noon to 1 o'clock has
been set as the hour for broad
casting the nation-wide hook-up
for the Stanford-Harvard debate
Friday, according to latest word
from oflices of the Columbia
Broadcasting system.
When two Stanford debatei's,
Howard Conn and John Huneke,
speak into the microphone in a
broadcasting room at KFRC next
Friday, they will be participating in
the first inter-collegiate nation-wide
broadcast ever attempted by Ameri
can colleges.
Via Columbia System
The debate, which promises to be
a history-making event in college
forensic circles, will be held with
Harvard University and is to be
broadcasted over the Columbia net
work of stations. The Harvard men
will speak from Boston.
Chosen from the Stanford debate
varsity to represent the western end
vf. the contest. Conn and Huneke will
defend the negative of the question:
'"Resolved, that America needs a
stronger central government." The
speeches will be ten minutes in
length with one live-minute rebut
tal allowed each side. Conn has been
chosen as first speaker and is to de
liver the Stanford rebuttal.
Hig Opportunity
'"The opportunity to speak to the
nation at large is indeed an oppor
tunity and behooves us to do our
very best," was Conn's comment last
night. "This will be a trying expe
rience to one who is accustomed to
speaking to a crowd. Debaters can
usually judge the strength of their
argument by the reception accorded
them in an audience, but to face a
microphone is another problem."
Conn, who is participating in his
eleventh major debate, is president
of Delta Sigma Rho, Stanford chap
ter of the national honorary debate
fraternity. "As for the topic," he
continued, "we can only say that it
is a prime favorite with debaters,
having been an issue since the days
when Thomas Jefferson first advo
cated state's rights. The ever in
creasing changes however, make il
seem more interesting than at first
glance."
John Huneke is an experienced
radio speaker. While at high school,
he helped put over a broadcasting
station representing the high school.
He has spoken in several plays and
also sang in a quartette over the
radio. "Appeal to the listener of a
radio program is different than to an
audience,' Huneke said. "Individ
uality that cannot be obtained in a
crowd can be put over in the radio
speeches.
"With the hour coming at noon,
we will have to inject an element
of housewife appeal into our talks.
The amount of fan-mail received
will be a good result as to the effec
tiveness of this new venture in de
bating fields."

uality that cannot be obtained in a
crowd can be put over in the radio
speeches.
"With the hour coming at noon,
we will have to inject an element
of housewife appeal into our talks.
The amount of fan-mail received
will be a good result as to the effec
tiveness of this new venture in de
bating fields."
Twelve noon to 1 o'clock has
been set as the hour for broad
casting the nation-wide hook-up
for the Stanford-Harvard debate
Friday, according to latest word
from oflices of the Columbia
Broadcasting system.
When two Stanford debatei's,
Howard Conn and John Huneke,
speak into the microphone in a
broadcasting room at KFRC next
Friday, they will be participating in
the first inter-collegiate nation-wide
broadcast ever attempted by Ameri
can colleges.
Via Columbia System
The debate, which promises to be
a history-making event in college
forensic circles, will be held with
Harvard University and is to be
broadcasted over the Columbia net
work of stations. The Harvard men
will speak from Boston.
Chosen from the Stanford debate
varsity to represent the western end
vf. the contest. Conn and Huneke will
defend the negative of the question:
'"Resolved, that America needs a
stronger central government." The
speeches will be ten minutes in
length with one live-minute rebut
tal allowed each side. Conn has been
chosen as first speaker and is to de
liver the Stanford rebuttal.

'"The opportunity to speak to the
nation at large is indeed an oppor
tunity and behooves us to do our
very best," was Conn's comment last
night. "This will be a trying expe
rience to one who is accustomed to
speaking to a crowd. Debaters can
usually judge the strength of their
argument by the reception accorded
them in an audience, but to face a
microphone is another problem."
Conn, who is participating in his
eleventh major debate, is president
of Delta Sigma Rho, Stanford chap
ter of the national honorary debate
fraternity. "As for the topic," he
continued, "we can only say that it
is a prime favorite with debaters,
having been an issue since the days
when Thomas Jefferson first advo
cated state's rights. The ever in
creasing changes however, make il
seem more interesting than at first
glance."
John Huneke is an experienced
radio speaker. While at high school,
he helped put over a broadcasting
station representing the high school.
He has spoken in several plays and
also sang in a quartette over the
radio. "Appeal to the listener of a
radio program is different than to an
audience,' Huneke said. "Individ
uality that cannot be obtained in a
crowd can be put over in the radio
speeches.
