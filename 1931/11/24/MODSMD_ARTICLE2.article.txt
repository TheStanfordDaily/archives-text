ciety, at a national convention. The
gathering of nearly a hundred col
lege journalists was held at the
University of Minnesota.

The most important act of the
convention, Humphreys said, was
the passing of a resolution request
ing Ihe executive council of the so
ciety to formulate a demand to be
presented to Will Hays, film czar,
that in the future the technique of
pictures dealing with newspaper
men be improved.

It has been the habit, the resolu

characters almost always as chronic
inebriatesâ€”a fallacy that must be
correctcd, the statement went on.
Humphreys was chairman of the
resolutions committee and composed
the document.

Prominent newspaper men of
