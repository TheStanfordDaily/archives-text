### 
BERLIN, Nov. 23. (/P) —Pure vita
min D is a poison as well as a life—
i saver.
This discovery was explained co
day as one result of the "isolation"
of a crystal which is pure vitamin
D,^ announced last week by Profes
sor Adolf Windaus.
Isolation means that the vitamin
has been separated completely from
all the other substances in which it
ordinarily exists. Professor Windaus
has a fragment of it in absolutely
pure form. He refused to discuss his
discovery, which required four
years' research, but he named as
spokesman Professor Carl Oppen
heimer, a Berlin editor of scientific
' publications.
"The physiological effects of the
; vitamin thus isolated," said Profes
| sor Oppenheimer, "are the same as
those of sunshine."
