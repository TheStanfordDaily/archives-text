# PHOTO OFFICIALS IRED AS CEMENT BEARS TURN RED
## 
### 
Rumors,that the Bear Photo
Service, of San Francisco,
would sue the A.S.S.U. wove
put at rest temporarily, at least,
by the assurance of the man
ager of the company yesterday
that no action would be taken
until the individuals who dis
turbed the peace and dignity
of several of the company's
cement bears had had time to
restore the animals to their
normal location and condition.
A large hear, very skillfully
adorned with a new variety of
red hair from a paint can, ap
peared at the bonfire last week,
and at least one other bear,
near Redwood City, was simi
larly ornamented and ap
peared as if in a post-Big
Game stupor. It was leaning
crazily on one edge of its
pedestal as if awaiting a strong
Stanford hand to complete its
downfall.
