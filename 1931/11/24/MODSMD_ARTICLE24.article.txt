# CARDS TO SEEK VICTORY IN AIR
## Dartmouth Strongest At Passing Game 
### Albert Guerard 
Aerial guns of the Atlantic and
Pacific clash at the Harvard Sta
dium Saturday when Dartmouth
faces a Stanford varsity that will be
fighting its way back from a 6-0
defeat by California in the Big
Game to recognition as one of the
country's strong teams.
Neither eleven has been able to
put a strong running attack on the
field in any of the games. Dartmouth
could gain only 16 yards on run
ning plays against Yale, and 25
against Harvard. About four first
downs in all. Weak interference has
bothered the running plays of the
Hanover team all year, but given
half a chance in an open field, Bill
'Morton and Bill McCall can step
with any halfbacks in the game.
Strong at Passing
However, Dartmouth is being
touted as the strongest passing team
in the country except Southern
Methodist. Bill Morton, whose edu
, cated toe kicks field goals at crucial
; times, is on the throwing end of
the combination which generally
winds up with the ball in the arms
of Bill McCall.
California completed passes fairly
easily against the Indians last Sat
urday, but the Bears have a very
; rough sort of a passing attack com
pared to Dartmouth's whirlwind al
ternation of short, bullet passes be
hind the line and long prayer passes
that go Ihrough the air for fifty
yards or more.
Stanford Line Stronger
Stanford's line will be stronger.
About a thousand yards and nu
merous touchdowns have been made
I through the Green line during the
i season, while at times Warner's for
ward wall, led by Corhus, Ehrhorn,
i and Colvin have shown at least
leverage strength. Pyles, Barber,
| Hoffman, and Captain Yudicky do
i good work in the Dartmouth line,
! but the rest shown glaring
weaknesses.
Dartmouth uses a conventional
wing-back formation on the offense,
i and does a good deal of running
/rom punt formation. On defense
they present a six-man line, with
I the center coming back into the
i forward wail as soon as the oppos
, ing team s shift has been completed.
