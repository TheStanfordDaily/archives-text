# IN, OUT PLAYS PRODUCE BEST GAINS FOR CAL
## Wide Run, Followed By Cutback, Big Ground Gainer Saturday "HANK" U.C.'S MOFFATT Bear Victory Is Tribute To "Navy Bill" 
### Lowell Cox 
''It'll work all afternoon!"
The Bears had just started their
j offensive drive in the first quarter
of Saturday's Big Game when Cali
fornia's press hox scout telephoned
that terse message to "'Stub" AUi
| son. Bill Ingram's first mate.
; He was referring to what they
term their "in-and-out" play, with
! Schaldach running wide, then cut
ting back through tackle or inside
• of end behind crushing interference,
then in or out again, depending on
the disposition made of the fullback.
Play Much Used
"He'll break away on that play
before the game is over," he added
| later, when Harry Hillman just
j grabbed the elusive left half after
; a short gain.
Work it did, and break away he
did. It was California's most con
i sistent ground-gainer, and they
flung it at first the left and then the
right side of the Indian line until
Hank finally broke loose in the
fourth quarter. He set sail from his
j own 40-yard line and had a certain
touchdown in sight when Hillman,
j the younger, nailed him on Stan
j ford's 15-yard lino with a flying
tackle after a desperate chase.
Misses Second Goal
A bit of a swerve, and he would
; have crossed Stanford's goal line
for the second time that day. Schai
; dach did for California what Phil
j Moffatt might have done for Stan
ford. But Phil wasn't even in uni
-1 form Saturday, kept out of his last
i Big Game by a knee injury re
ceived in the U.S.C. tilt, the third
bad break that chained him to the
bench for most of the season that
should have seen him make a bid
for Ail-American.
j George Watkins, California's best
kicker, was also kept on the bench
i by a foot injury, but California had
\ Schaldach, and f Schaldach was
PLENTY.
Ingram Big Success
j That six-to-nothing score Satur
day was a tribute to the enormous
amount of work accomplished by
j "Navy Bill" Ingram this year. He
set about building morale, stressing
fundamentals, when he came to the
' coast—started at the very bottom.
Even Pop Warner, who was ;i
pessimistic Pop 1 his season, re
marked early in the year that he
: didn't suppose anybody expected a
| great deal from Ingram in his first
j season. And here we find him and
j his Bears in second placb in the
jconference!
Bears Improve
"Clumsy" was the word most
j frequently applied to the Berkeley
eleven in early season. They eked
! out a (5 to 2 win over Santa Clara,
a tough one for the Broncos to lose.
Against St. Mary s the Bears looked
| pitiful against passes and showed
1 no offense at all.
It was the St. Mary's game, how
ever, which tipped off what was to
i be California's greatest strength
i the play of the line from tackle io
tackle. But it was still a mighty
i crude team.
Powerful Line'
The Olympic Club found that line
; too strong and was dumped, 6 to 0.
The following week the Bears got
their real start, defeating Washing
