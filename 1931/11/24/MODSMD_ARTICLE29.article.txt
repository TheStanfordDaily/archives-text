# MOVIES AND THE PRESS
## 
### 
II has long been a policy of the theatre and the movies
to feature the dramatic and the colorful in their productions
and in this wise to create entertainment for their patrons.
This is all well Â«and good when the characterizations are
truthful. The damage occurs when false portrayals, under
the title of "Realism," are given wide circulation. This
latter situation has been pitifully true in almost every re
cent picture dealing with newspapers and newspapermen.
Reporters have been almost invariably pictured as hard
drinking, hard-living, hard-writing beings who live in a
half-world of newspaperdom.
Journalism during the past few years has come to be
recognized as a profession, as witness the number of
schools and departments of journalism that have become
integral parts of colleges and universities all over the
t nited States; the newspapers and educational institutions
are working in closer harmony and to mutual advantage.
Now comes this wholesale libel of newspapers^and
newspapermen which can only undermine reputations and
destroy faith. It is true that journalism and journalists are
not perfect. Nevertheless, the present situation will go a
long way toward undoing I lie work of years spent in con
stant improvement and in efforts for betterment.
Sigma Delta <'hi, in convention in Minneapolis during
the past week, struck at the root of the trouble and set in
motion machinery calculated to meet the invidious propa
ganda. The national journalism fraternity unanimously
passed a resolution condemning the practices of the picture
directors and requesting the co-operation of Will 11. Hays,
movie czar.
It will be interesting to watch the battle between these
two giants of a modern age, the press and the movies; it
will be a battle not without bloodshed, a battle that will go
down in historv.
