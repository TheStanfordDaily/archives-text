# GET TOGETHER, BOYS

Of course, it's none ol" our business, but the reccnt state
ment by President Rufus Von Kleinsmid of Southern (Cali
fornia that a IT.S.C.l T .S.C. I .(C.L.A. football game "would divide
the allegiance of the city to which both universities be
long," is interesting, at least.
The two teams did not meet this year because the
Bruins refused to accept tlie Trojans' opening date, con
tending that their team, no longer a set-up, was worthy of
;i better spot on the schedule. They have since proved that
contention beyond all doubt. For some reason also best
known to their respective athletic managers, the two teams
do not meet in 1!K52, either. I'.C.L.A. is said to have of
fered the Trojans any date they wanted, but in vain.
President Von Klcinsmid has been quoted as saying
that unfriendly relations existed between the two institu
tions. Later he was said to have retracted that statement,
so you can see that things are pretty much messed up, any
way.
The Daily is not Irving to frame Southern (California's
football schedule, but it is curious to know what lies be
hind the Trojans' reticence to play their Westwood rivals.
Natural rivals they are, obviously, and a game between
them would be a great attraction, especially now that the
Hruins have won their place in the gridiron world.
President Von Kleinsmid's objection concerning the di
vision of allegiance in Los Angeles does not appear valid.
11 is not unreasonable to believe that the students of the
two schools, no matter how worked up they may be, will
hardly engage in mass riots. (Certainly the staid citizens of
Los Angeles won't.
