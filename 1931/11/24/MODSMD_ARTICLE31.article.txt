The following editorial appeared as is in (lie Dailt/ Cali
fornidii, Friday, November 20. If (lie weather of last Sat- j
urdav persists on future IJig (lame days, Stanford heartilyi
concur with the sentimenl herein expressed.
"Shade, at last.
"Ever since the Stanford stadium was built California
has'had the sunny section at the Big (lame. Hear rooters
have always viewed the game through squinted eyes,
whether it was played in Berkeley or Palo Alto. Cardinal!
rooters saw it in both places without the need of eve
shades, glasses or fans.
"This year Californians will sit in the shade. They will
enjoy the weather as well as the game. They will appre
ciate Stanford students' newly acknowledged appreciation j
of their sealing preferences in the stadium. They will hope
that having the shady side at Pah) Alto will become an es
tablished tradition."
There will be no staff meeting today. Rejoice, ya mugs!!
The Business Staff' will meet tonight at 7:.'*o sharp. Any
absentee will continue absent.
