# BULL SESSION
## A 						ROUGH QUESTION 
### 
A custom is defined as an active
tradition, while a tradition is de
fined as a dead custom. Now
whether the Stanford "rough" is a
tradition or custom is a very moot
point on this campus. When one
sees full suits on the quad, polished
automobiles in abundance, smooth
shaven faces at every turn, and
slicked hair dandies acting like they
were getting a big break when a
member of the "500" talks to them,
one is apt to feel that the rough is
as much a thing of the past as the
old campus wine-press.
However, there are certain times
when the rough comes forth in all
his reputed glory. To eat at Sequoia,
to look at the corded mobs on the
outside of campus dances, to walk
through the Encina court and give
vent to the sophomore battle cry—
is but to receive ample evidence
that the rough in all his primeval
lustre is still with us—for better or
for worse.
But whether the rough is in evi
dence during the week or not, he
is sure to creep out of his hiding
place on Friday nights—that is, those
Friday nights that are featuring
campus dances. Here) he can be seen,
hanging around on the outside—his
eyes feasting on the bright lights,
the gay music, and the beautiful
creatures that glide about the pol
ished floor in the arms of meticu
lously dressed and groomed
"smoothies." Now sometimes he
will confine his pleasure to this vi
carious sort during the whole eve
ning; other times, he will try to
force his way in and be forced out
again; other times, he will organize
his fellow roughs and crash en
masse; while, once in a while, roughs

j will be voluntarily admitted by
| guards who are tired of watching
j entrances against ever-alert and
j often very crafty roughs.
I Now why not make it a campus
I custom to let roughs in at every all
i University dance after a certain
; hour—say midnight? The plan is
! equitable and worthwhile from
| many angles. First of all, there are
1 always a certain number of men at
| every dance that would be more
i than glad to have some roughs re
-1 lieve them; they have accepted blind
j dates from misrepresenting or un
: discriminating individuals or, per
| haps, they have obliged the room
i mate's girl friend. It might be ar
'' gued that the charging roughs would
■ not aid him, but the fact that the
1 loughs are coming from the dark
| into the bright light very suddenly
I and the fact that the eye accommo
j dates fairly slowly, usually results
jin the rough's tapping everything
I that wears a skirt—no matter what
J she looks like. Of course, the women
; that are being tapped like it. They
never stop to realize that their sud
[ den popularity is due to the ratio
j of men and women present at the
i affair; and consequently feel that
j their own exotic charm has at last
i swept all before it. This puts them
j in a delightful state of mind,
i The only people that lose by the
j letting in of roughs are the selected
few lhat feel that the SHE of the
j evening is the only SHE in creation
—and these people usually leave
before midnight. As one who has
been in looking out, and one that
has been out looking in, we think it
would be a vitalizing of Stanford
tradition to let 'em come in at a rea-
I sonable hour. —Abe Mellinkoff
