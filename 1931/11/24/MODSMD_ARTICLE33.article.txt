SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS—At
the Filmarte Theatre, San Fran
cisco.
How much nearer the French film
producers get to both life and art
than does moralist Hollywood is re
vealed even by this light musical
romance. Set in the slums of Paris,
"'Sous les Toits de Paris" glimpses
the life of a pickpocket and an in
constant young lady and tries to
reform neither. The picture tells the
simple story of how Albert picks up
Pola, loses her to his pal and goes
back to street singing while another
pal gaily lifts purses from the
crowd.

Director Rene Clair dares to
evolve romance from a locale
stereotyped by American directors
as the home of the fallen only, films
his love scenes in settings as realis
tically dingy as an oriental water
front, and in general treats his Vina
Delmar-like characters like human
beings and not musical comedy
types.

The picture is shorn of dialogue
until it is almost a silent picture
except for a pleasant and ever
present musical score and several
excellent songs. The story is easily
understandable. Consistently light
direction, superior camera angles
and photography and a remarkable
ease of telling the story without
words or forced pantomime make

it an unusual film and one dis
tinctly un-Hollywood.
Two splendid travel pictures nnd
the presence of the usual dialogue
repeaters behind you who do it in
French add to the variety of the
show. —D.W.

WIIOOPS MY DEAR—At the Green
Street Theatre, San Francisco.
Wonders will never cease; here
are Charlotte Neste, the beautiful
redhead who announced acts in the
' Nine o'clock Revue," and Ginger
Pearson, a comedy lead in Ihe San
Francisco production of "Girl
Crazy," wasting their time at the
Green Street. If as much work and
talent had been put into "Easy for
Zee Zee" as is found in "Whoops
My Dear" it would still be running.
There are no chorus numbers, yet
there is plenty of music and danc
ing. It reminds one of the days
when talking pictures used songs
in their most serious efforts.
"Hi Ho the Merry Ho, What Has
Come Over Me?" should keep this
show on the boards for quite awhile
to come. "Whoops My Dear" is just
a less funny version of the notori
ous "Easy for Zee Zee." It isn't
good but it does have its moments.
Every one will be glad to hear
that the theatre is decorated with a
completely new set of pictures.

Wonders will never cease; here
are Charlotte Neste, the beautiful
redhead who announced acts in the
' Nine o'clock Revue," and Ginger
Pearson, a comedy lead in Ihe San
Francisco production of "Girl
Crazy," wasting their time at the
Green Street. If as much work and
talent had been put into "Easy for
Zee Zee" as is found in "Whoops
My Dear" it would still be running.
There are no chorus numbers, yet
there is plenty of music and danc
ing. It reminds one of the days
when talking pictures used songs
in their most serious efforts.
"Hi Ho the Merry Ho, What Has
Come Over Me?" should keep this
show on the boards for quite awhile
to come. "Whoops My Dear" is just
a less funny version of the notori
ous "Easy for Zee Zee." It isn't
good but it does have its moments.
Every one will be glad to hear
that the theatre is decorated with a
completely new set of pictures.

SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS—At
the Filmarte Theatre, San Fran
cisco.
How much nearer the French film
producers get to both life and art
than does moralist Hollywood is re
vealed even by this light musical
romance. Set in the slums of Paris,
"'Sous les Toits de Paris" glimpses
the life of a pickpocket and an in
constant young lady and tries to
reform neither. The picture tells the
simple story of how Albert picks up
Pola, loses her to his pal and goes
back to street singing while another
pal gaily lifts purses from the
crowd.

Director Rene Clair dares to
evolve romance from a locale
stereotyped by American directors
as the home of the fallen only, films
his love scenes in settings as realis
tically dingy as an oriental water
front, and in general treats his Vina
Delmar-like characters like human
beings and not musical comedy
types.

The picture is shorn of dialogue
until it is almost a silent picture
except for a pleasant and ever
present musical score and several
excellent songs. The story is easily
understandable. Consistently light
direction, superior camera angles
and photography and a remarkable
ease of telling the story without
words or forced pantomime make

it an unusual film and one dis
tinctly un-Hollywood.
Two splendid travel pictures nnd
the presence of the usual dialogue
repeaters behind you who do it in
French add to the variety of the
show. —D.W.
