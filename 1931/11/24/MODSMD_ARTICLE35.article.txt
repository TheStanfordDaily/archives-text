NEW YORK, Nov. 23.—(/P)—'Two
thousand Communists marched on
city hall today to protest against the
city's $631,000,000 budget in gen
eral and Mayor James J. Walker's
$40,000 salary in particular.
Almost 300 policemen were as
signed to special duty in City Hall
Plaza and order was easily main
tained, the Communists contenting
themselves with marching around
with banners and presenting a sug
gested relief program which would
immediately fill the pockets of the
unemployed from the city's coffers.

sprinter; recently acted as a U.S.C.
