# The
						Windjammer
## 
### 
In consideration of the general at
mosphere of mourning prevailing
for some reason or other on the
campus this week, the Windjammer
doffs his humorous disguise and of
fers the following bits:
Lament of Broken Fiddle Strings
And there shall be
no more to sing,
no more of sighs,
when we hear snapped
the fiddle strings,
when music dies.
And hands shall all
be folded then,
the days grow still,
and we lie down
to waiting then,
long years to fill.
—W. Me.
Mask
Oh, Mirth
That crowns the sorrow
Of an aching heart;
And Pride,
That keeps a laughing mouth apart;
Forever let me wear this crown of
jest
To hide the way a breaking heart
has bled.
' —L.M.
