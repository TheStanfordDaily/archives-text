Early one November evening in
1928 a happy bunch of Indian foot
ball players boarded a transconti
nental train. They had just snatched
a 13 -to - 111 tie out of the Big Game,
after California apparently had it in
■the bag.
Pop Warner sent a new back
field combination into the sec
ond half of that game to save
the clay, one steady scoring
drive and a last-minute pass
accounting for the necessary 13
points.
The next week-end those same
Indians invaded New York City to
crush a favored Army eleven in one
of football's classic upsets.
Another November evening
three years later, and a not-so
iiappy Indian squad boarded a
transcontinental train. They had
iiist lost the first Big Game in
eight years. .
Again the Old Fox had sent a new
backfield combination into the sec
ond half of the game, a combination
whose bid lor glory was denied.
That same squad is now on its
way to Boston to meet Dartmouth
and make a final attempt to redeem
itself.

While Stanford has been {jo
int; through a mediocre season,
Jet's have a look at what Dart
mouth has been doing.
Norwich ami Iluflalo were
mere warm-ups for the Hanover
eleven, while Holy Cross was
subdued in a close battle. 14
to 7.
Then came their first setback,
Columbia upsetting the Big Green
team, 19 to G, in one of the early
surprises of the eastern season.
After a breather with Lebanon
Valley, Dartmouth came back to tie
Yale, ."13 to 33, launching a brilliant
last-half attack to nullify a 23-
point lead.
Proving the real greatness of
the Green eleven, Harvard, then
undefeated, was held to a 7 to G
score the next Saturday, only a
pass in the closing minutes
snatching victory away from the
boys from Hanover,
Then Cornell, who held a 13-
to-0 victory over Columbia, fell,
14 to 0.
The ability to come back is shown
by that record. Apparently the team
is at the peak of its season, and
after a rest last week-end, Dart
mouth should be ready to . give
Stanford a whale of a battle Satur
day.
Dartmouth, incidentally, will be
the sixth team that has pointed for
the Cards this year, Minnesota,
Washington, U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and
California all having more or less
gone out of their way to make
things interesting for the Warner
eleven.
At last it's out—why Califor
nia couldn't win for seven years.
Somebody broke a mirror over
liiere before the 11)21 game.
