# PRACTICE MEET HELD ON OVAL AT 4:15 TODAY
## Ellington Is In Charge Of Varsity Track During Dinkâ€™s Absence 
### 
This afternoon's practice moet,
! which will be held on the old oval
j at 4:15 o'clock, should include some
! speedy performances as many of
! the boys will be in a hurry to get
i away from school for the Thanks
j giving holidays. All races except
j the sprints and hurdles will be run
at but three-fourths of thoir regular
distances; the field events, however,
will be complete as it is difficult to
ask a man to shot-put or high-jump
i three-fourths as well as he is able.

Bill Ellington, who is in charge of
both varsity and freshman squads,
due to Dink Templeton's illness, al
' lowed the men to take their own

i workouts yesterday in preparation
I for today's meet. The practice ses
i sion marked the first appearance of
j Schween, Bowles, and Cotton, three
freshman lootballers who have de
cided to replace Rabbit Bradshaw's
I calisthetics by Bill Ellington's set-
I ting-up exercises.

The brethren Hables also were
I out limbering up, but will of course
i be in no condition to run today.
' Ferrie, Butler, and Atkinson also
i will not compete this afternoon, due
to injuries past or present.

There is a chance that the day's
most closely contested race will be
between Giberson, A1 Blackman,
and possibly Lombardi and Willson
lor second place in the 100 behind
i Ben Eastman. Much interest will be
attached to the performances of
Sam Eastman, Dan Murphy, and
i Horse Guittard as the fourth man
on the relay team will probably be
I chosen from among these three.

i The hurdles will find Dean Stal
! lin g s again trying to defeat Jack
Brugman in the highs and Gus
Meier having similar designs on
i Cotto Herbert in the lows. Ray,
| Lyman, and Jones are standouts in

the javelin, shot-put, and discus,
! while Johns and DeGroot should
as usual put up an interesting badle
in the pole-vault.
