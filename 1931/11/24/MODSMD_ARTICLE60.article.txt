# BOARD FAILS TO AID GERMANY IN CRISIS
## 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 23. (/P)â€”Germany's
economic salvation has failed to
come from Chancellor Bruening's
advisory council which held its final
session under the chairmanship of
President Paul von Hindenburg to
day.
Instead of leading to internal
truce, the meetings of the economic
council brought the resignation of
the three agricultural members and
a declaration in behalf of the six
labor members that they did not
agree with Chancellor Bruening's
conclusions.
