# CAESAR DISCONSOLATE Birthday Party Called Off AS BRUTUS DISAPPEARS
## 
### 
"And Caesar yowled, and yowled,
and yowled."

Brutus went away, is still gone,
and Caesar cannot be pacified.

Upstairs, in the basement, around
the yard, Caesar goes in n never
ending search for his buddy, crying
out in heart-rending sobs.

Caesar and Brutus are twins; they
have a birthday pretty soon; Brutus
may not be there to help do away
with the birthday cakes and dog
biscuit.

Brutus is a little bob-tailed Irish
terrier, who for the past several
weeks has made his home with
Caesar at one of the houses on the
Row. Until yesterday everything
was happiness; then Brutus disap
peared and has not come back yet.
