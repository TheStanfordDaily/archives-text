# CHINA SUBMITS NEW PROPOSAL AS PEACE MOVE
## Provisions Under Council's Instructions Demand Prompt Action FINAL RESORT PLANNED May Ask Interpretation Of Three Articles 
### 
NANKING, China, Nov. 24. (/P)—
The Chinese delegate at the League
of Nations Council was instructed
today to submit a new proposal,
containing stifler provisions than
China's previous suggestions, for
settlement of the Manchurian con
flict.
The proposal was dispatched to
Paris by Dr. Wellington Koo, who
yesterday took over the administra
tion of the foreign office. Its chief
provisions are:
• (1) Immediate effective mea
sures by the League to end
aggressive acts by Japanese
troops.
(2) Withdrawal within the
railway zone of all Japanese
forces two weeks after the adop
tion of the Chinese proposal by
the League.
(.1) Neutral representatives to
supervise this withdrawal.

PARIS, Nov. 24. (A*)— The Chi
nese delegation to the League of
Nations Council prepared tonight
for a final desperate gesture in case
China's demand that Japan evacu
ate Manchuria goes unheeded.
That gesture, if inactivity and
lack of progress continue, will be
to ask the leaders of the League
whether there is any meaning in the
three "keystone" articles of the
League covenant.
One of these articles is No. X,
over which the American Senate
battled so fiercely. It guarantees the
territorial integrity and independ
ence of League members—and this
same engagement, so far as China
is concerned, is contained in the
Nine-Power Treaty, of which the
United States is a signatory.
The other two articles are Nos.
XV and XVI, which provide the
League with the "teeth" which
members of the Council have frank
ly admitted they are not ready to
use on Japan. They contain the pro
visions for military and economic
sanctions.
The Council stood on its unofficial
resolution providing for cessation of
hostilities and for a commission of
inquiry, and requesting the Japa
nese to withdraw their troops so
soon as security conditions allow,
with the possibility of neutral
observers to help the process.
