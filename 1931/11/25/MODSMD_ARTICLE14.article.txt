## Reader Makes Characters Seem Life-Like 
### Ralph Malloch 
i Last night the Assembly Hall was
j treated to the unusual spectacle of
|an "you could hear a pin drop"
! audience.
j The silence of the large gathering
| throughout the reading of "The
I Barretts of Wimpole Street" by Mrs.
| Guy Stevens Farrington demon
j strated the worth of the presenta
! tion pven more effectively than did
j the tremendous applause at the
l close.
Tall, charming, and with a strong,
I interesting face, Mrs. Farrington nad
! the audience with her every mo
! ment. Completely at ease, she
changed her voice' and expression
! with remarkable facility from that
i of an overbearing man to a frail
1 woman, and back again, or perhaps
! to that of a frivolous young girl or
a stuttering boy. Every character
was sure and distinct and real,
j Mrs. Farrington's interpretation
; of the love story of Elizabeth Bat -
i rett and Robert Browning could
! hardly be more entertaining on the
I stage, no matter with what cast of
actors. The audience had nothing
I before them but Mrs.
' her book, and her art. But to every
| one of the tense listeners Elizabeth
, Barrett's bedroom was as tangible
as Palo Alto.
The darkened auditorium added
j to the impressiveness of Mrs. Far
i rington's strong face and command
! ing figure standing in the circle of
! light.
