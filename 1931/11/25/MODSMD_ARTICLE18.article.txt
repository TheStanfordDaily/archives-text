# Turkey And Football Vie For Thanksgiving Honors
## 
### 
This afternoon 1 Hey go—some
i three thousand of them—on an an
jnual Thanksgiving jaunt, and prob
; ably offering their thanks more for
j tlie weleome holiday than anything
j else. Some home, some "visiting,"'
some to study. All to eat turkey or
j goose, dream turkey and goose, but
mainly to talk football .... and
| Dartmouth.
Until Saturday evening most of
j the local Indiums will have no time
j for a real Thanksgiving, especially
j those who meandered East this
| week to play football with that
i Eastern college, and those who will
j eagerly listen to broadcasts of xhe
fray.
Members of the frosh and varsity
basketball squads will be allowed to
| partake of the traditional end-of
! November delicacies .... if they
| watch the scales. And Coach Schall
I has announced that all boxers in
| the forthcoming tournament must
| keep within their weight limits . . . .

which means either no turkey or
I heap-big workouts to a lot of cam
-1 pus pugilists .... if they are called
j that.
And more Thanksgiving . . . .
this for the fact that "finals" still
ARE two weeks off .... and not
yet too imminent a problem to those
j who wish to remain in this Univer
j sity next quarter. At least until
Monday, when over-nourished
'brains will commence to grapple
with such dangerous reflections.
An enthusiastic Stanford Rough
will offer up his appreciation of the
j sweetness of life at that time when
he may once again step into the
cords, jeans, and moles so definitely
"taboo" off-campus. And the 500 has
a lot to be grateful for—principally
| because they are outnumbered
about 7 to 1, which are pretty good
odds in any country.
In spile of it all, things seem to
point to Saturday as THE DAY. We
may have a lot more to add to our
list.
