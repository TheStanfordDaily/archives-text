# U.C. Students Will Pay For Game Damage
## Goal Posts, Water Wagons Are Listed On Bill 
### 
"To the victor belongs the spoils"
does not apply to goal posts and red
water wagons, evidently.
Word has been received from the
University of California that the
student body will compensate Stan
ford "for any damage in the sta
dium" accomplished by the rejoic
ing hordes who could not restrain
their jubilation over the first Golden
Bear victory in seven years.
The size of the bill has not been
made public; but the market price
of red water carts is said to be
around $300. Whether or not the
cost of removing paint from the
Quad and doctor bills for repairing
the injuries incurred by gallant
freshmen in defending the bonfire
will be included has not been an
nounced.
