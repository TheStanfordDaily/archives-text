a chance tliat Phil IMoffatt will he back in the lineup for a while
at least, the Indians of Stanford will meet the Indians of Dartmouth
at Cambridge Saturday. It will he the Stanford eleven's last chance to
redeem itself after a mediocre season, and it will be "Pliancy Phil's" last
chance to perform for his alma mater.
Wire reports from Chicago, where the squad spent yesterday sight
seeing, indicate that Moffatt is improving rapidly from the knee injury
which kept him out of the Big Game last Saturday. He has worked out
with the-squad during several brief practice sessions on the trip Kast, and

fis regarded as a likely starter.
Squad in Shape
The rest of the squad is in good
I shape, with the exception of Windy
, Bigolow, who will be kept out of
j the fray by old injuries aggravated
i during the California game. Red
| Hand, George Grey, Chuck Ehrhorn,
j Hay Hulen, and Bill Doub all re
; ceived injuries of one kind or an-
I other last Saturday, hut are cx
j pected to be ready this week.
Stanford's starting lineup is un
-1 certain, with Bill Bates and Jack
j Hillman likely to crowd out the

regulars at center and fullback.
i Bates came up suddenly from the
; fourth string to play a large portion
of the Big Game at center, and Pop
Warner was so pleased by his work
j that he indicated after the game
| that Bill will probably displace both
( Marks and Milligan for the position
i Saturday.
Jack Hillman May Start
Hillman, starting the second half
| of the game at fullback, was a small
! sensation and may get the call over
Allen and Rintala against Dart
mouth. Whether he starts or not, he
is sure to see a great deal of service.
Captain Harry Hillman at quarter,
and Caddel and either MofTatt or
' Hardy at halves should complete
; the backfield.
With Bigelow out, Hulen will
| probably start at left guard. Left
: tackle is uncertain, with George
Grey handicapped by an ankle in
jury. He appeared stronger than
Hand last Saturday.
i Doub and Colvin, ends, Ehrhorn,
| right tackle, and Corbus, righ!
j guard, can be expected to complete
j the lineup.
"Toss-up"—Warner
"Toss-up" is the word Warner
( again applies to the game, which is
i expected to be played before a ca
pacity crowd at John Harvard's sta
dium at Cambridge.
Dartmouth has had an up-and
down season. Falling to Columbia
jin an early season upset, the Big
. Green team came back to tie Yale,
j 33 to 33, in a spectacular game, and
i hold Harvard to a 7 to 6 score the
i following Saturday.
After defeating Cornell, 14 to 0,
1 two weeks ago, the Hanover eleven.
! rested last Saturday to point, for
! Stanford.
Last year, it will be remembered,
| it took the Big Red Machine's best
i game of the year to stop the in
j vaders from New Hampshire, 14 to
j 7. This year, playing the Hanover
! team on an eastern field, the Indian
j Reds will have a battle on their
! hands.
Ernie Nevers, former Card star,
i met the team in Chicago and
j "showed them the town."
