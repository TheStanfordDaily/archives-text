# VERSATILITY WITH ALPHABET EARNS RAPF $50 AWARD
## 
### 
Just four letters of the al
phabet, shifted around in the
proper places to form a nine
letter word, netted Maurice
Rapf of the Stanford Daily staff
exactly $50.
It all came about when the
executives of the M-G-M stu
dios in Culver City needed a
title for Joan Crawford's new
picture. Rapf, who was work
ing there at the time, suggested
the one-word monicker, "Pos
sessed," and the executives
used it, awarding Rapf the
customary $50 prize given for
titles used by the M-G-M com
pany.
"Possessed" just finished a
three-day run at the Stanford
Theatre, and it is rumored that
the originator of the title sat
through two performances just
to see the word flashed on the
screen.
