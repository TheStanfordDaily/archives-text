Sobered and a little dazed by the defeats by both I'.S.C.
and California, Stanford awaits the last game of the sea
son, the intersectional. tilt with Dartmouth next Saturday.
Dartmouth, in spite of its splotchy season, is one of the
strongest teams in the East and a victory over the Hanover
Indians would be balm to a bruised pride.
Stanford has been too long on the top to accept defeat
in a matter of fact way, too accustomed to victories to give;
up resignedly after a couple of losses. If the Western In
dians can take the Eastern Indians in a decided fashion, a
major part of the nationwide respect for Stanford football,
built up by Glenn Scobey Warner, will be salvaged from
the wreckage left by the Bears and the Trojans.
