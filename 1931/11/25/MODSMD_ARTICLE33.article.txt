# SHATTERED ILLUSIONS

in the Minnesota Daily, campus organ of that univer
sity, was printed, in all seriousness, a plea for dates for the j
football players, who will soon break training.
The request runs, in part:
"Several athletes fear they won't be able to get dates for;
the brawl. They claim old acquaintances have withdrawn.
They have appealed to 'The <iMinnesota Daily to assist in
re-establishing pleasant connections.
"So we beseech blondes, brunettes and red-beads to
come to the rescue. And that establishes the Daily sports
date bureau for relief to hard working and non-dissipating
gridmen. Send in your applications to the Daily sports of
fice now. Replies assured."
After having generally accepted the Hollywood version
of the handsome football hero, surrounded by hordes of!
feminine admirers competing for his attention, the thought :
of a dateless halfback seems incongruous.
