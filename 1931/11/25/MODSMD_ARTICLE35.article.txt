After a brief douse of horse liniment and a spirited
rubdown, the truculent Columbia Spectator took up its
quarterstaff and once more laid into the Columbia Athletic
Association in a way which bade fair to cast a little more
light and not a little muck on the Athletic Association's
reproachfully mule shrug lo the Spectator's demand to see
the Athletic Budget.
The first thwack to connect in the second Spectator of
fensive was the point blank charge that the Athletic Asso
ciation had instigated the chairman of the Student Hoard
to propose, under the bland guise of spontaneity, that the
Hoard pass a resolution favoring an increase of from $20
to $2~> in the annual student activity fee. This resolution
was fmallv adopted, and netted the Athletic Association,
according to the Spectator, the tidy increase of $10,0(H)
more per annum.
As it stands, the move would be mere hypocrisy, im
plies the Spectator, but for the fact that the student body
is denied access to the books of the Athletic Association.
An aura of mvsterv enshrouds them.
Of the three student members of the Athletic Commit
tee of the I'nivcrsity, who are permitted to inspect the
books, only one can understand the terms of the budget—
at least the other two admittedly do not—and all three are
accustomed to take for granted the legitimacy of the Ath
letic Association's expenditures, further charges the Spec
tator. Those eligible to see the books are Ralph Hewitt,
football captain, Gavin MacHain, varsity crew candidate,
and David Jones, president of the student board.
The editorial concludes with this comment:
"The Athletic Association is denying the student body a
fundamental right that of knowing how and where its
money is expended. Why?"
Ourselves, we like the more athletic if less insinuating
phrase of Patrick Henry: "Taxation without representa
tion is Tvrannv!" The Dartmouth.
