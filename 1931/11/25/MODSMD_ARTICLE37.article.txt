# BULL SESSION
## NEVER BE THANKFUL 
### 
Tomorrow is the day of cranberry |
' sauce and turkey meat—the day
when most people have another
! "Sunday dinner" in the middle of !
| the week and when the less for
i tunate outdo themselves in prepar
-1 ing a truly unusual feast. It is the
period of the year- when hopeful i
restaurant owners serve turkey din
ners on Thursday, turkey sand- |
wiehes on Friday, turkey croquettes j
on Saturday, and turkey hash for !
weeks and weeks. In many homes,
still resting on the fundamental [
ideals of the nation, someone re- i
members after the first courses have I
been removed and while the family
is waiting for mince-meat pie that j
' this is "THANKSGIVING DAY," i
1 anci some wit will remark—"Thanks- j
giving Day means the day to give !
thanks" —which is a remarkable de- !
duction, to be sure.
It is then customary for someone
to recite all the things for which we
must be thankful. If the atmosphere
is more intellectual, one can expect I
j the conversation to turn to how
many more things this age has, as
compared to past eras. This gives j
everyone a feeling of glorious ac- !
complishment and the dinner is a
success.
Contentment has always been
preached as the great virtue to be
I reached. The poets have long glori
fied the great happiness of this type
, of individual; and some philosophers
have idealized the world of content

| ment. But in reality the person who
is satisfied is never happy. The j
pleasures of life come in striving j
and not attaining. The childish j
pleasure of climbing the forbidden j
j ladder ended when we reached the i
last rung. The joy of invention or |
j creation of any kind ends with its
| realization; the men who are capable
: of doing great things can never be
! happy with the mere reflection on
! their accomplishment.
In short, we must never be con- j
; tented. The only purpose of goals
1 should be heights to be reached be- j
I fore the higher mountain in the dis
] tance can be conquered. As happi- !
j ness comes in striving, we must j
| seek to always have something we
j are striving for. If we are seeking j
! degrees, we should not be content !
■ with four or five—but should strive j
j to have a veritable scattered alpha- ]
j bet after the name. If we want auto- 1
j mobiles, never be content —if you I
| possess a half-dozen Packards, strive I
I then for a dozen Hispano-Suizas,
I and then on and on. If love be your
| measure of happiness, one conquest
1 should be but the stepping stone to \
j the next, etc., etc.
In short, wo should give up
Thanks tomorrow—but not for what
we have, but rather for what we !
have yet to attain. When we are '
contented, we are ready to pass on. i
When world contentment has been '
reached, a new order is in need.

It is then customary for someone
to recite all the things for which we
must be thankful. If the atmosphere
is more intellectual, one can expect I
j the conversation to turn to how
many more things this age has, as
compared to past eras. This gives j
everyone a feeling of glorious ac- !
complishment and the dinner is a
success.
Contentment has always been
preached as the great virtue to be
I reached. The poets have long glori
fied the great happiness of this type
, of individual; and some philosophers
have idealized the world of content

| ment. But in reality the person who
is satisfied is never happy. The j
pleasures of life come in striving j
and not attaining. The childish j
pleasure of climbing the forbidden j
j ladder ended when we reached the i
last rung. The joy of invention or |
j creation of any kind ends with its
| realization; the men who are capable
: of doing great things can never be
! happy with the mere reflection on
! their accomplishment.
In short, we must never be con- j
; tented. The only purpose of goals
1 should be heights to be reached be- j
I fore the higher mountain in the dis
] tance can be conquered. As happi- !
j ness comes in striving, we must j
| seek to always have something we
j are striving for. If we are seeking j
! degrees, we should not be content !
■ with four or five—but should strive j
j to have a veritable scattered alpha- ]
j bet after the name. If we want auto- 1
j mobiles, never be content —if you I
| possess a half-dozen Packards, strive I
I then for a dozen Hispano-Suizas,
I and then on and on. If love be your
| measure of happiness, one conquest
1 should be but the stepping stone to \
j the next, etc., etc.
In short, wo should give up
Thanks tomorrow—but not for what
we have, but rather for what we !
have yet to attain. When we are '
contented, we are ready to pass on. i
When world contentment has been '
reached, a new order is in need.
