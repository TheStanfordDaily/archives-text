DISORDER—By Siinone. Translated
from the French by Henry K.
Marks. E. P. Dutton & Company.
1931. (At the Palo Alto Rook
Shop.)
The effect produced by "Disordci"
is a veritable Slough of Despond.
The book is depressing, gruesomely
realistic, and written in a jerky,
impressionistic manner. The style
is comparable to the present-day
output of Soviet Russian ultra-im
pressionism. This of course lends the
book an atmosphere of chaos. The
author's object seems to be exactly
this: to create an overwhelming im
pression of disorder in preference to
literary excellence of style. It is an
interesting experiment.
The story is a young girl's con
flict with a chaotic, disorganized en
vironment. The general tone of the
work follows this paragraph: "Since
her last encounter with this same
landscape, in what has she suc
ceeded? In nothing. A failure, and
again a failure, that was her bal-

I ance sheet .She too made mistakes.
| She stood up, her heart gnawing
1 her: she had to change her place.
I But the strctched-out legs of a
| sleeping traveler barred the way."
Simone, whose first zook this is,
! has been called "one of the greatest
; emotional actresses of our day." In
; 1924 while touring America in
! dramas of Pirandello and Sardou
' she commenced to write "Disorder."

;MY STORY—By Mary Roberts
Rinchart. Farrar & Rinehart. 1931.
j (At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
. 432 pages of Mary Roberts Rine
hart is, after all, 432 pages of Mary
Roberts Rinehart. The one induce
ment that is additional to the usual
j inducements to read her stuff is the
| desire to discover what it is that
makes her tick or more particularly
what it is that has kept her ticking
j so long.
We shall begin with an analysis
lof the conclusion of the book. We
I discover the authoress saying: "I am

\ not through. I am still going on .... [
I am singing no swan song. Some- !
times I realize that I am just finish- j
ing my literary apprenticeship, and
! that soon I shall really start to
' write. But in the interval I am con- j
i tent and happy." What an admirable J
'spirit! Carry on Mary! By the way,
' here is one we almost skipped: "I
j am not modern, in the new sense." j
j We now affix Q.E.D. to our analysis
which we didn't have to write, did ;
I we?
j Seripusly, the woman has had a i
| full and interesting life. She seems j
gifted with unbounded energy and j
1 is, above all, a good sport. She has j
been a good "family woman" and \
i has succeeded in having adventure !
i at the same time. Her experiences
in war-time France make fme copy. !
Especial praise is due Mrs. Rine
-1 hart for not writing too much about
j the how v why, and when of her ;
i books.
With this in mind go ahead arid
j read the book, but remember that
! your curiosity is our recommenda- I
! tion to do so. —E.T.P. '
