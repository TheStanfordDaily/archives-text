# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
thank the calendar for a holiday I
while we're still trying to recuper
ate from last weekend nothing i'ke j
a midquarter on Wednesday then a
turkey dinner the next day to make
you feel exactly like dying pronto
but the contrast between home and
mother and the head waiter at the
hotel antic is still something to be !
thought about

simple saps seem simpler since
Saturday syncopation soothes
saddens simplifies simpletons
snore safety sinks sages sing
sagas slithering somnambulists
slink subdued sleep sleep sleep
—known as a colyuninists dream

windjammer has some questions
to ask people things that have wor
ried us for some time and maybe at
least the BAC you know good old
fight on for BAC would get a laugh
out of it
the first one is how that cer
tain fraternity house ticket of
fice is getting along these days

now that the big game is over
bet they swindle poor lonely
little widows and orphans out of
union coffee .tickets the poor
things
and confidentially we want to
know who is responsible for the
lilting soprano voice to be heard
ever so often drifting down from
the third floor of what is commonly
known as toyon hall a dormitory
for gentlemen students of Stanford
university something should be
done about it this cant go on for
ever what about it my man you
might at least invite callers up once
in a while

has anyone noticed how much
the stcenford bands newest and
most played so called march
sounds like bolero or any num
ber of other tangoes you happen
to mention every time they play
it we expect our little yell
leaders to break into a song and
dance with maybe mother re
bckah brown beating time on a
tamborine
the only thing that makes us

cheerful at all is the thought that
maybe we've saved ourself from
flunking out this quarter by a his
tory ex we crashed through with
this morning just two of the ques
tions still worry us a little maybe
you can help with suggestions
the first one was about the
pope and his authority all we
could remember was that a
papal bull was a gentleman cow
belonging to the pope
the other was ancienter yet all
about the great general Caesar and
his works all that we could re
member was how strong he was you
know he was so strong that he threw
a bridge across the rhine we thank
you all and wish you an aching
vacation

sagas slithering somnambulists
slink subdued sleep sleep sleep
—known as a colyuninists dream

windjammer has some questions
to ask people things that have wor
ried us for some time and maybe at
least the BAC you know good old
fight on for BAC would get a laugh
out of it
the first one is how that cer
tain fraternity house ticket of
fice is getting along these days

now that the big game is over
bet they swindle poor lonely
little widows and orphans out of
union coffee .tickets the poor
things
and confidentially we want to
know who is responsible for the
lilting soprano voice to be heard
ever so often drifting down from
the third floor of what is commonly
known as toyon hall a dormitory
for gentlemen students of Stanford
university something should be
done about it this cant go on for
ever what about it my man you
might at least invite callers up once
in a while

has anyone noticed how much
the stcenford bands newest and
most played so called march
sounds like bolero or any num
ber of other tangoes you happen
to mention every time they play
it we expect our little yell
leaders to break into a song and
dance with maybe mother re
bckah brown beating time on a
tamborine
the only thing that makes us

cheerful at all is the thought that
maybe we've saved ourself from
flunking out this quarter by a his
tory ex we crashed through with
this morning just two of the ques
tions still worry us a little maybe
you can help with suggestions
the first one was about the
pope and his authority all we
could remember was that a
papal bull was a gentleman cow
belonging to the pope
the other was ancienter yet all
about the great general Caesar and
his works all that we could re
member was how strong he was you
know he was so strong that he threw
a bridge across the rhine we thank
you all and wish you an aching
vacation
thank the calendar for a holiday I
while we're still trying to recuper
ate from last weekend nothing i'ke j
a midquarter on Wednesday then a
turkey dinner the next day to make
you feel exactly like dying pronto
but the contrast between home and
mother and the head waiter at the
hotel antic is still something to be !
thought about

simple saps seem simpler since
Saturday syncopation soothes
saddens simplifies simpletons
