# Card Mermen Smash Three Collegiate Marks
## NATIONAL RECORDS SET BY MC KELVEY Pacific Coast Time Broken By Wiget In The 220 
### 
Not satisfied with one record, two i
members of the varsity swimming
tram which recently broke unoffi
cially the national intercollegiate
400-yard mark combined efforts
yesterday to finish off the quarter
by piling up three more records
between them.
John McKelvey added to his un
official records by clipping off 50
yards in the short sixty-foot pool in
22.6 seconds. Then, apparently un
tiled, he turned to the long pool io
set a new unofficial national mark
of 17-) seconds in the 40-yard free
style.
Makes 2:17 Flat
His teammate, Ted Wiget, later in
the afternoon plunged into the green
water to catch up with Jimmy
Triola, who was given a head start,
and reel off 220 yards under the
Pacific Coast intercollegiate record
time of 2 minutes, 17.1 .seconds, held
by Austin Clapp, negotiating the
distance in 2:17 flat.
' McKelvey\s time was not quite
so fast as on Monday, when he
came through with a 22.G finish in
the 50-yard event, but yesterday
four watches caught him in 22.8,
which may be a little more accurate
than Monday's effort, although that
also was carefully timed. Tuppy
Gardner and Gordon Graves finished
behind the record-maker in that
order. The mark which McKelvey
has unofficially broken is held at
present jointly by Rule of Annapolis
and Schwartz of Northwestern.
Gardner Second
Gardner and Graves finished in
the same order behind McKelvey
in his 40-yard effort in the seventy
five-foot pool. The record at which
the Cardinal star will aim officially
next winter is 18.3 seconds, at pres
ent held by Samson of Michigan,
and was made in 1928. Judging by
McKelvey's wide margin, he should
stand an excellent chance of lower
ing it substantially next quarter.
Tn the varsity 100-yard contest,
Ward Woods finished ahead of
Raven in the time of 58.1 seconds.
Knapp, after getting off to a very
poor start, never quite regained his
loss, and pulled in third. The only I
other varsity, or semi-varsity, event .
included in the last time trials of |
the quarter was the 100-yard back- :
stroke, in which only Frank Booth j
and Bill Rogers, freshman splasher, ,
entered. Booth finished a shade
ahead of the babe star in 1 minute j
8.2 seconds.
Freshman events were confined ;
to the 220-yard free style, 50-yard
free style, and 100-yard backstroke, j
although Triola paced Wiget in the
varsity 100-yard, Nakayama, varsity j
man, finishing third. Results of these i
three events were as follows: 220- ;
yard free style, won by Taratiik, !
2:44 flat; second, Hirsch. 100-yard
backstroke, won by Clark, 1:17.2;
second, McDowell; third, Cook. 50-
yard free style, won by Hart, 27.6
seconds; second. Gratt: third, Brock
meier.
