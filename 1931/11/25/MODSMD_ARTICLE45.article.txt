# HEAP BIG POW POW!
## Morton, McCall, Captain Yudicky Combine to Give Hanoverians Effective Passing Attack 
### Feg Murray, '16 
When the Red Indians from Palo
Alto meet the Green Indians from
the Hanover Hills, anything can
happen, and you can bet your boots
it will be some tea party they're
gonna have in Boston on November
28! Dartmouth vs. Stanford, Harry
Hillman vs. Harry Hillman, the East
vs. the West! Ain't we got fun?
Stanford came back East in 1028
to wallop the Army by four touch
downs, and folks around New York
allowed as how they had never seen
such a varied and deceptive attack
as those Indians from Palo Alto put
on for the edification of the East
erners on that day. Dartmouth this
year has been a sensational team,
providing most of the fireworks that
has occurred in the East this season.
That 33-33 tie with Yale was a
thriller, and the Dartmouth defeat
of Cornell a sensational upset. Mor
ton and McCall are a fine pair of

backs, and Capt. Yudicky is a very
good end. The Stanford team is not
as strong as the 1928 outfit, but Capt.
Hillman is a real star, and so is Phil
Moffatt, when injuries don't handi
cap him.
Herb Fleishhacker, the 225-lb.
Stanford quarterback who shone so
brightly against the Army three
years ago, scouted Dartmouth
against Cornell and told me after
wards that the Big Green team is
going to be awfully tough to beat.
Both teams have been beaten this
season, but the game ranks high
among the intersectional battles of
the year, probably second only tc
the Notre Dame-U.S.C. affair. Dart
mouth, I believe, was the last East
ern team to defeat a far-Western
outfit, and this happened in 192C
when Fat Speers took his boys out
to Seattle to trim Washington about
28 to 7. Stanford beat Dartmouth
last year, 14 to 7.
