We wonder what the tactics of
one Bill Ingram will be next year.
Building morale, convincing the
team it COULD win, inspiring good,
old-fashioned fight were Ingram's
principal tasks this season. It has
been suggested that ho "talked" his
squad into making the showing it
did.
So far, so good. But how will
he proceed next fall? ' That
splendid spirit shown by the
Bears last Saturday was the re
sult of seven long years without
a Big Game win—and a year
long fight talk.
Without that spirit, the Bears
would have been just another foot
ball team, a team with no particular
offense. Master psychologist that
Ingram has shown himself to be, it
is doubtful if he will be able to keep
his charges next year, and the year
after, at the fever pitch they were
this season.
Two linemen stood out' in Satur
day's classic, two players not read
ily noticed by the crowd. One, ol
course, was our own Bill Corbus
Stanford's great right guard; the
other was Dick Tozer, California
tackle.
Corbus, "the baby-faced as
sassin," was mixed up in every
play thrown at his side of the

line, and some that were not.
The Bears found him a decided
annoyance all afternoon, just as
had the Trojans two weeks be
fore.
One of the reasons why the left
side of the Indian line looked weak
was because of the slashing play of
the California line star, To/.er.
Schaldach made his best gains at
the left side, and Tozer was the
answer.
Both lads should be remembered
when the "all-coast" season opens.
Now California wants to pay
for the goal posts and the little
red "tea wagon" they swiped
Saturday.
All of which shows the proper
spirit and all that sort of thing—
but means Stanford will have a
pair of Blue and Gold goal posts
to pay for next year. —L.M.C.

champion, is the proud father of a
