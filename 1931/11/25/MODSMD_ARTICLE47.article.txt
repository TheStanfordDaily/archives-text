## Cold Wind Pails To Daunt Stanford Trackmen 
### 
A nice, clear, wintry day failed j
Ito daunt brave-hearted Stanford ;
j track men yesterday afternoon, and |
j only two events in the practice |
I meet had to be called off for lack j
; of entrants.
Jjick Brugman turned in the finest :
j performance of the day, taking the j
high hurdles in :15.5. By the end j
iof the year he should be shading j
15 seconds regularly. Gus Meier j
pulled a surprise by beating out i
j Dean Stallings for second place in i
I this event.
21.6 in 220
j If anyone but Ben Eastman had j
j run the 220 in :21.G yesterday, he i
j would have gotten eight-column
j headlines, but Bangs turned in this
I startling mark with little effort.
I Ralph Giberson took his turn at the
! 100, winning from Eastman in :10.2. '
: Ralph also took second in the 220
, a short distance behind Blond Ben. j
i A1 Ray again threw the javelin J
over 185 feet for a 35-foot victory j
over his nearest competitor. Black- j
I man and Keeble tied at 5 feet 10 !
i inches in the high jump. Ned Johns ■
and Bert DeGroot also finished even j
1 up in the pole vault at 12 feet G 1
! inches.
Lyman put the shot 47 feet 10 j
j inches. Les and Ike Hables, out for i
1 the first time in several weeks, ■
showed the effects of their layoffs, j
; but are expected to work in in good
j shape.

I tation set by Brother Ben, won the 1
'three-lap run in 3:24, with Fullen- j
wider running the event for the
