# TEMPLETON ENTERS PLEA FOR CHANGE IN I.C.4-A. MEET DATE AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
1 In an attempt to have the 1.C.4-A. !
(meet scheduled for July 8-9 next
| summer at Berkeley moved back
| one week to July 1-2, Dink Tem
pleton yesterday wrote East to Feg :
I Murray of the 1.C.4-A. Executive 1
! Committee asking that the change j
; be made. Templeton was supported
' in his objections by Lawson Rob
j ertson, Pennsylvania track mentor ;
j and head coach of the U.S. Olympics
| team in 1928.
j Murray, star Indian hurdler in i
i 'IG, is Stanford's representative on j
! the committee, which is composed
j of three men, one from each of the j
I three colleges placing highest in the
I last 1.C.4-A. meet. Templeton, in his i
letter to Murray, stated that it is
J impossible for any man to compete j
in two such strenuous meets as this
and the Olympic Games tryouts !
within six days and still show well
in the second. The latter are sched
! uled here for July 15-16, 1932.
Templeton also said that none of .

I the track teams on the Pacific Coast
have ever received expenses for the
meet and that this year's idea of
raising $65,000 for that purpose is
I entirely new. He added that a
' greater sum could be made by hav
i ing the trials on Saturday, July 2,
and the finals on Monday. July 4,
when a larger crowd Would be likely
; to attend because of the holidays.
The Indian coach also stated that
two large meets, so close together,
i would hurt the attendance ol' both.
J Because the majority of the colleges
have no real Olympic prospects,
other coaches have not made many
i similar complaints, he said, but at
the same time they agree with him
\ on the plan.
Templeton expressed the conten
tion that Murray would be able to
| have this change made and thus
permit the Stanford athl|rtes to enter
both meets. He has refused to per
mit them to do so if the dates are
! not changed.
