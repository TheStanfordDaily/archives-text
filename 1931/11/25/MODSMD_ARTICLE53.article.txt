## Three Defaults Mark Day's Mural Football Play 
### 
j Defaults by Phi Delta Phi, the
| K.A.'s, and the Shysters caused only
: three intramural football games lo
' be played yesterday. The all-im
] portant battle between the Phi Sigs
| and Theta Xi was held as scheduled
| in spite of the frigid weather, how
, ever, and resulted in a 6-0 Phi Sig
j victory. This game, which decided
j the leadership of League IV, was
! close throughout, and the only score
came when Ralph Wardwell faded
back to pass, found all the possible
receivers covered, and pulled a Rin- '
tala by running instead for a touch
down. Wardwell's effort was good
for 55 yards. Outside of Wardwall,
Frietas of Theta Xi was the ouf- j
standing man on the field. j
The El Toro outfit, led by Vard j
Loomis, won the championship of !
League 111 when it administered a j
21-0 defeat to a disorganized Delt |
team. All three of the passes that I
resulted in the El Toro scores were j
thrown by Loomis, and two of them
fell into the arms of Gene Mires, j
Toro scored twice in the first half i
1o make the ultimate outcome of the 1
game a certainty, and throughout j
the contest presented a well-organ- j
ized attack that may carry them to l
the intramural championship. ;
Griggs and Owens did well for the |
losers.
A much-harrassed Sequoia II
squad was pushed further into the
cellar of League I when the S.A.E.'s
rolled up 27 points to {he hall team's :
0. Tlie Budge to Beenfeldt pass j
combination scored twice, and on ;
another occasion Budge passed to j
Fred Shidler for a touchdown. John I
Shidler made the final tally when j
he intercepted a Sequoia pass.

broke the tie for last place in I
League IV between the two teams. |

leadership of League VI due to the
Shysters' forfeit yesterday, and tne ,
Chi Psis won a much needed game j
when no Phi Delta Phis showed up. '
j Defaults by Phi Delta Phi, the
| K.A.'s, and the Shysters caused only
: three intramural football games lo
' be played yesterday. The all-im
] portant battle between the Phi Sigs
| and Theta Xi was held as scheduled
| in spite of the frigid weather, how
, ever, and resulted in a 6-0 Phi Sig
j victory. This game, which decided
j the leadership of League IV, was
! close throughout, and the only score
came when Ralph Wardwell faded
back to pass, found all the possible
receivers covered, and pulled a Rin- '
tala by running instead for a touch
down. Wardwell's effort was good
for 55 yards. Outside of Wardwall,
Frietas of Theta Xi was the ouf- j
standing man on the field. j
The El Toro outfit, led by Vard j
Loomis, won the championship of !
League 111 when it administered a j
21-0 defeat to a disorganized Delt |
team. All three of the passes that I
resulted in the El Toro scores were j
thrown by Loomis, and two of them
fell into the arms of Gene Mires, j
Toro scored twice in the first half i
1o make the ultimate outcome of the 1
game a certainty, and throughout j
the contest presented a well-organ- j
ized attack that may carry them to l
the intramural championship. ;
Griggs and Owens did well for the |
losers.
A much-harrassed Sequoia II
squad was pushed further into the
cellar of League I when the S.A.E.'s
rolled up 27 points to {he hall team's :
0. Tlie Budge to Beenfeldt pass j
combination scored twice, and on ;
another occasion Budge passed to j
Fred Shidler for a touchdown. John I
Shidler made the final tally when j
he intercepted a Sequoia pass.
The K.A.'s default to the D.U.'s i
broke the tie for last place in I
League IV between the two teams. |
Theta Chi still has a mathematical ,
chance to tie the A.T.O.'s for the
leadership of League VI due to the
Shysters' forfeit yesterday, and tne ,
Chi Psis won a much needed game j
when no Phi Delta Phis showed up. '
