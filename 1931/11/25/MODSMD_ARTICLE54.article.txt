# MEN PREPARE FOR JOBS STUDYING DOMESTIC SCIENCE
## Cooking, House-Cleaning, Gardening Taught By Mothers' Club 
### 
The organization of men's classes,
for instruction in domestic arts is
one of the plans that lias been for
warded to help the unemployment
situation on the campus this year.
According to Mrs. Irene Spenner of
the employment office there are four
cooking classes now being con
ducted, and next quarter classes in
house-cleaning and gardening will
be started.
Each of the four classes in cook
ing has four members and is in
structed by members of the Stan
ford Mothers Club. One mother
takes four of the boys enrolled in
Ihe classes into her home and in
structs them in the culinary arts.
They not only cook, but are taught
to serve and set the table correctly.
Steady Jobs Given
When their training has been
completed and their teacher feels
confident of their qualifications, they
are placed in well-paid positions.
Each one of the boys who was in the
class last year is occupying a steady
job this year with room, board, and
cash as reward.
After Thanksgiving a house
cleaning class will start in the same
way as the cooking classes. The
pupils will be taught, among other
things, the tricks of expert clean
ing, floor-waxing, window-washing,
and paint-washing.
Results Satisfying
The results of these classes, ac
cording to Mrs. Spenner, are very
satisfying and it is hoped that many
boys who would otherwise be un
able to qualify for positions will
thereby be better fitted for them.
The statistics are not yet ready
for publication, but it is evident
that although the number of appli
cants for jobs this year is greater
than at this time last year, the
number of vacancies is also greater
and more people have been placed
this autumn quarter than last.
Anyone interested in enrolling in
any of the classes may do so by
applying at the student employment
office in the Administration Build
ing.
