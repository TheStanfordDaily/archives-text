# WEBFOOTS TO FACE STRONG ST. MARY'S ELEVEN TOMORROW
## 
### 
i With total mileage behind them,
I which approximates more than half
the distance around the world, a
very complete University of Oregon
football squad goes methodically
j about their daily workouts at Bur-
I lingame High School in anticipation
Jof their Turkey Day contest with
| St. Mary's in San Francisco,
i Regardless of dope and opinion a
! hard nip-and-tuck battle is ex
j pected. The records stand with St.
| Mary's having a win over U.S.C.,
j several other important victories to
| their credit tapered off with a de
j feat from U.C.L.A.
! Oregon's lapse came at the first
of this season. Coach "Doc" Speers
had built a strong offense around
the now ineligible Joe Lillard, whose
"Midnight Express" tactics over
powered the University of Wash
; ington. But the colored flash was
; barred and Oregon lost to U.S.C.,
i 53 to 0. Later, North Dakota was
: held to a scoreless tie, New York
j University, and U.C.L.A. beaten
I with a brand now type of ball
1 evolved by the Large Doctor since
| just before mid-season.
