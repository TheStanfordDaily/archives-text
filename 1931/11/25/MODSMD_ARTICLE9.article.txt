# WALKER TO ASK MOONEY PARDON
## "Jimmy" To Have Hearing With Rolph Tuesday 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 24. (/Pi-
Coming to San Francisco to ask his
friend, Governor James Rolph, to
grant a pardon to Tom Mooney,
Mayor James J. Walker spent half
his first day explaining he is in
California only as a private citizen,
and the other half studying the case
he is to present to the governor
next Tuesday.
As soon as a series of receptions
had been concluded, the New York
mayor went into an extended con
ference with other lawyers, includ
ing Frank P. Walsh, Aaron Sapiro,
and local counsel. Then he went to
call on Mrs. Mary Mooney, 80-year
old mother of the man serving a life
sentence for alleged participation in
a parade bombing in San Francisco
on July 22, 1916.
Although it was revealed today
that "Jimmy" Walker wrote "Jim"
Rolph many months ago about the
case, it was a telegram from
Mooney's aged mother which caused
Walker to reach a decision to come
to California to plead for executive
clemency for her son.
Returning from his call on
Mooney's mother, Walker again
went into a study of the case and
its many ramifications extending
over a period of more than 15 years.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
the mayor of New York will confer
here on plans for the hearing. The
conference will follow a discussion
on the same subject by Rolph and
Sapiro.
