TOKYO, Nov. 29. (/?)â€”The Japa
nese Foreign Office today revoked
its criticism of Secretary of Stale
Henry L. Stimson for statements on
the Manchurian situation that had
been misconstrued as his, and said
the situation had been entirely
clarified.
"Mr. Stimson assures that he did
not make any such statements as
I thought from press dispatches,"
said a spokesman for the Japanese

Foreign Office, which yesterday ac
cused the American Secretary of
State of "losing his head" and "fly
ing into fulminations."
Japan Retracts
"Therefore I consider my im
pulsive expressions yesterday en
tirely uncalled for," the spokesman
continued. "I desire to state .that
any part of my statement which was
not proper is hereby revoked. The
assurance given by Mr. Stimson to
Ambassador Debuschi clarifies the
situation entirely to our satisfaction.
The incident is closed."
The American Secretary of State
Friday made public portions of an
exchange of notes on the . Man
churian situation between Japan
and the United States.
Statement Misconstrued
Japan has disclaimed any inten
tion of attacking Chinchow, and in
view of this Secretary Stimson said
it was difficult for him to under
stand press reports the Japanese
were advancing toward Chinchow.
Other statements were misconstrued
in Japan as coming from him.
Colonel Stimson's categorical de
nial that he made the statements
erroneously attributed to him and
a cable of explanation from Am
bassador Debuchi at Washington
were received in Tokyo with great
satisfaction.
Peace Plans Menaced
The Foreign Office spokesman ex
plained the ire of the Japanese of
ficials had been aroused by their
assumption that the purported sen
timents might have served to stiffen
the stand of Marshal Chang Hsueh-
Liang at Chinchow and generally
militate against a peaceful solution
of the controversy in Manchuria
between China and Japan.
