# COAST CHALKS UP ANOTHER AS S.F.U. CONQUERS DE PAUL
## 
### 
The University of San Francisco
football team chalked up another
intersectional victory for the Pacific
Coast yesterday by beating De Paul
University of Chicago, 38 to 7.
The San Francisco team was mas
ter at all times, save for one light
ning thrust in the second period
when De Paul took to the air and
put over a touchdown.
De Paul was outplayed during the
greater part of the first half, but
late in the second quarter struck
back with one spectacular march
that was good for a touchdown and
brought the score to 13 T 7 at the
intermission.
The Chicagoans executed their
thrilling comeback through the air,
a forward pass from McGivern to
Doddy being good for sixty-nine
yards and a first down on the 10-
yard line. In four more plays Mc-
Givern scored over tackle and Stef
fen added the extra point.
Until this thrust, however, the
visitors were outplayed by a S.F.U.
team which showed great attacking
strength and plenty of defensive
mettle.
