# Roble Burns Midnight Oil Thursday Night Shows Greatest Activity Men Lack ‘500’s’ Ambition
## 
### HARRY McMASTERS 
It's not competition for entrance
alone which raises the 500's grade- '
point average above that of the
sex—the little dears also
1 burn more midnight oil than the 1
men.
That is the conclusion reached by
a student whose habit it has been
1 to study late in the Press building
nearly every night in the week.
Observations taken of Roble, Encina,
Branner, and Toyon at and after the
witching hour formed the basis for j
, this startling discovery. Sequoia,
being off the studious one's home- |
t ward path, did not figure in the i
I observations.
| At 12 o'clock Roble is a blaze of
! light, according to the observer,
i while Encina has but a dozen lights
burning in the upper floors, where
the seniors and graduates dwell,
i Branner and Toyon are likewise
growing dark by this time. By 12:30
only seven or eight lights linger on
in Encina, Branner and Toyon have
even less, but Roble is still going
strong.
When the old bell tower chimes
lout 1 o'clock, Encina still has three

( or four lighted windows, Branner
1 and Toyon are dark except for an
occasional night when one or two
students study late, but Roble sur
passes them all. At 1:30 even Roble
is growing sleepy, Encina has but
i one or two earnest students, and
Toyon and Branner have shut up
i shop.
At 2 o'clock all is quiet in the
men's dorms, but Roble has still a
few seekers after light. No obser
! vations were made after this hour.
Among the men, the frosh don't
| show any enthusiasm at all about
, acquiring scholastic honors, although
they didn t mind staying up all
night to guard the bonfire. Branner
i and Toyon students are beginning to
realize it is time for them to study
a bit, while the seniors and gradu
ates in Encina, faced with the im
minent necessity of earning their
daily bread, study late every night.
Thursday nights see the most ac
tivity in all the dorms, for there are
so many exams on Friday. Mid
i quarters induced more than the
usual number to forego their regu
i lar amount of rest.

It's not competition for entrance
alone which raises the 500's grade- '
point average above that of the
sex—the little dears also
1 burn more midnight oil than the 1
men.
That is the conclusion reached by
a student whose habit it has been
1 to study late in the Press building
nearly every night in the week.
Observations taken of Roble, Encina,
Branner, and Toyon at and after the
witching hour formed the basis for j
, this startling discovery. Sequoia,
being off the studious one's home- |
t ward path, did not figure in the i
I observations.
| At 12 o'clock Roble is a blaze of
! light, according to the observer,
i while Encina has but a dozen lights
burning in the upper floors, where
the seniors and graduates dwell,
i Branner and Toyon are likewise
growing dark by this time. By 12:30
only seven or eight lights linger on
in Encina, Branner and Toyon have
even less, but Roble is still going
strong.
