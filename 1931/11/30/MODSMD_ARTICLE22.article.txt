: men "magicians," with defense so
i airtight that the Hanover team com
; pleted but four of 31 passes at
tempted, there was no stopping
Stanford Saturday.
Blocking, weak point of the Car

so perfect that not a Dartmouth
| player was left on his feet when
Caddel rounded left end to start his

tackle. Harry Hillman fed him a
i long pass for a first down on the
j Green's 11-yard line, and there
were only three feet remaining after
Jack Hillman and Gordon Camp
bell battered through each tackle
