In ;m adjoining column, Gilbert C.arr points out the
one obvious weakness in President Hay Lyman Wilbur's
plan to make Stanford solely a graduate institution by
eventually getting rid of the Lower Division. That weak
ness is the admitting of junior college transfers with little
or no restrictions, while refusing admission to freshmen
with relatively higher scholastic averages.
The fact that the t'niversitv now admits between .'5OO
and 100 freshmen means that those admitted have a very
high scholastic record, inasmuch as two or three times as
manv are turned awav. Junior college enrollments are
►# * '
composed, for the most part, of students whose high school
marks were not good enough to get them into a college or
university of recognized standing. Stanford admits these
men and women as juniors, J>nt turns away men and
women with better records as freshmen. The procedure
is not only unfair, but deleterious in its effect.
Of course, grades are not everything in high school, any
more than they are everything in college. But they are the
one unchanging standard by which the University can
make its choice.
President Wilbur, in seeking eventually to do away
with the Lower Division, expressed the belief that the edu
cational system of the nation, with its present eight-year,
four-year, l'our-year divisions, would evolve into a six,
four, four, four split, Stanford to be a graduate institution
to which would-be professional men could come after four
years of, junior college. To date, there has been little or
nothing in the way of educational revision to hear out
President Wilbur's contention.
The Daily docs not mean to impute that junior college
transfers are not fitted to be Stanford students, but it does
firmly believe that they are being favored by discrimina
tion against freshmen, with a resultant lowering of the
I diversity's scholastic standing.
It is from the seholasthc angle, of course, that the prob
lem must be viewed. No matter how the undergraduates
and some of the alumni feel about it, Stanford is first a
( diversity and second the home of good football teams.
And because it is first a I'niversity, ils officers should seek
to preserve, not to destroy, its high rating as a seat of
learning.
