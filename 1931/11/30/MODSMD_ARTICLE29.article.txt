football, Stanford found a winning streak. Dartmouth
happened to he around just about that time. Result: '52 0.
If might have happened with almost any other team pul

ground out of the Old Hod Machine Saturday.
"Hp and down" is a suitable characterization for 1931

end on the'"up." That one game, if nothing else counted,
would have made the season worthwhile.
