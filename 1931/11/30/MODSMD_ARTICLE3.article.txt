# BRANNER INMATE DEFEATS HUNGRY ANTS' STRATEGY
## 
### 
Branner ants have proved
themselves surprisingly versa
tile, as well as persevering, in
another battle of the species in
which homo sapiens has tried
to outwit him. One inmate of
the hall, upon receipt of a
good-sized and luscious cake,
was immediately afflicted with
the omnipresent malady and,
being suposedly as clever as
the insects, carried out the fol
lowing steps:
1. Hung cake in box by string
from top of door-space. No
avail. 2. Soaped string. Ants
would fall onto package and
continue their meal. 3. Hung
in different manner by string.
No avail. 4. Put strong cold
medicine on string. No avail.
5. Mounted package on three
bottles in pan of water. Woke
up next morning to find little
darlings swimming in single
file. fi. Ate cake.
