# BULL SESSION
## RACKETEERING INVADES THE FARM 
### 
When, last Spring Quarter, some
body by mistake picked up one of
our textbooks from the library
"lobby," it was a big joke. We rea
soned that the book was accidentally
picked up and the person forgoi how
to find his way back to the library
when he found our name smeared
over the fiy-leaf. Now, however, two
notices of missing articles can be
found on the racks in the library
lobbies. One naive soul asks the
person who took his text by mistake
to return it; while the other person,
while realizing that his coat has
gone, begs for the return of his pipe
—remarking that while he doesn't
mind freezing to death, he does
want to smoke.
Now, the prospect of having to
watch all one's belongings on the
campus every minute is not at all
pleasing. Students have been in the
habit of leaving books, pens, coats,
and similar property wherever it is
most convenient; but the old order
changeth. If people a'round here
continue to get so absent-minded
that they forget to return other
people's things taken by mistake, it
will be necessary for each student
to toddle around from class to cfiass
with his slicker and his other para
phernalia strapped on to him like
so many pack burros about to enter
some hinterland. However, it may
be that the disappearance of these
things is due to refutation and
abandonment of the institution of
property by campus free-thinkers.
Now, liberalism is a grand thing—
but it is much better when it sticks
to one's own possessions. If these
individuals want to communize prop
erty on this campus, let them all
get together, label their stuff "com

] munity property," and have a great
j time "borrowing" each other's be
j longings.
However, when these embryo
[ communists begin exercising their
! theories in this capitalistic world of
| ours, people are apt to use stronger
! words than "communist." That
j property should not be safe in an
| institution of higher learning sur
-1 prises many. But good old Aiistotle
! realized many years ago that intel
i lectual prowess and morality (of
! which stealing is a manifestation of
| the lack thereof) are not necep
; sarily Siamese Twins.
j We, in college, actually don't be
j believe what we are learning in
classrooms. Students can write
! glorious, and sometimes even in
! spiring, papers, on the necessity of
j obeying the dictates of the group
i organization, etc., etc., and then feel
' absolutely no qualms in turning
about and scalping two Big Game
I tickets—before the ink has dried

j very persons who took the things

habit of leaving books, pens, coats,
and similar property wherever it is
most convenient; but the old order
changeth. If people a'round here
continue to get so absent-minded
that they forget to return other
people's things taken by mistake, it
will be necessary for each student
to toddle around from class to cfiass
with his slicker and his other para

so many pack burros about to enter
some hinterland. However, it may
be that the disappearance of these
things is due to refutation and
abandonment of the institution of
property by campus free-thinkers.

When, last Spring Quarter, some
body by mistake picked up one of
our textbooks from the library
"lobby," it was a big joke. We rea
soned that the book was accidentally
picked up and the person forgoi how
to find his way back to the library
when he found our name smeared
over the fiy-leaf. Now, however, two
notices of missing articles can be
found on the racks in the library
lobbies. One naive soul asks the
person who took his text by mistake
to return it; while the other person,
while realizing that his coat has
gone, begs for the return of his pipe
—remarking that while he doesn't
mind freezing to death, he does
want to smoke.
Now, the prospect of having to
watch all one's belongings on the
campus every minute is not at all
