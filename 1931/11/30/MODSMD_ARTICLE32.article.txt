## ON JUNIOR COLLEGES 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
In spite of the 32 to G defeat of |
Dartmouth at Boston Saturday I be- |
lieve all signs indicate that Stan- j
ford's position at the top in athletics i
is gone. If the Dartmouth game
means anything it means that the
Warner system is poison to any
team that hasn't faced it year after
year, and that with it Pop can beat
the strongest teams in the East with
mediocre material. But to win. on
the coast, where the system is j
known, it takes a little more than j
it took in Boston. I think Pop's |
system is the greatest in America
because its mixture of deception and
power brings results with a mini
mum of effort. But even Warner j
needs a fair amount of material to i
work with. Where would Southern J
California be by this time if with j
his reliance of sheer power Coach
j Jones had had to get his material
for the last three years from fresh
man classes of 300? The wdnder has
been that the Indians have stayed
near the top so long. Menlo J.C. has
something to do with it, but we j
can't depend on Pop and on Menlo
to keep us in the conference much
longer. Pop may retire, and Menlo
kids may decide to go somewhere
else.
The idea of eliminating the Lower
Division is to make Stanford an in
stitution of higher learning whei'e
students will come for their last
two years of college, and will be
expected to spend at least two years
more doing graduate work. Thus
only those with a serious purpose
in coming to college \*ll be at
tracted. It sounds good on paper, ;
but let's think a minute on how it j
will work out. Since there are less j
freshmen taken in, there will be j
room for more transfers. Therefore I
the competitive standards for trans- !
fers will be lowered. Those who
couldn't get in as freshmen may
now come in as juniors. Instead of
a carefully selected freshman class
of 500 who are thoroughly initiated
for two years into Stanford citizen
ship before they begin the serious
work of the upper division, we will
have a yearly influx of transfers \
from a nondescript collection of' i
junior colleges throughout the state, j
Their scholarship standards will i
vary; they will know little of our j
ideals and traditions; they will be |
merely "stepsons" of the Stanford j
Red. It would be as logical for a I
mother to put the care and training i
of her child for the first six years j
of its life in the hands of an utter !
stranger. This isn't merely my j
theory; a good percentage of those '
who are being let in now as trans- j
fers couldn't get in as freshmen. If '
it is as easy for a transfer to get in j
as it appears, it is certain that Stan- j
ford's scholastic prestige will be j
hurt, and is being hurt.
It seems to me and to most of !
those with whom I have talked on
this matter that to let in a freshman
class of 500 and cut down on the
number of transfers would solve
what will soon.be a major problem.
The administration of the Univer
sity in everyday matters is not the !
concern of the students or alumni, j
But since the University is com- j
posed of three groups, faculty, I
alumni, and students, I think thai/
all three groups should have a say
in large questions of policy. While
the students should never presume
to dictate to those in authority, their |
opinion should have some weight in
University affairs. I therefore re- j
spectfully propose a Quad referen
dum to get student opinion on the |
retention of the Lower Division and
a freshman class of 500.

kids may decide to go somewhere
else.
The idea of eliminating the Lower
Division is to make Stanford an in
stitution of higher learning whei'e
students will come for their last
two years of college, and will be
expected to spend at least two years
more doing graduate work. Thus
only those with a serious purpose
in coming to college \*ll be at
tracted. It sounds good on paper, ;
but let's think a minute on how it j
will work out. Since there are less j
freshmen taken in, there will be j
room for more transfers. Therefore I
the competitive standards for trans- !
fers will be lowered. Those who
couldn't get in as freshmen may
now come in as juniors. Instead of
a carefully selected freshman class
of 500 who are thoroughly initiated
for two years into Stanford citizen
ship before they begin the serious
work of the upper division, we will
have a yearly influx of transfers \
from a nondescript collection of' i
junior colleges throughout the state, j
Their scholarship standards will i
vary; they will know little of our j
ideals and traditions; they will be |
merely "stepsons" of the Stanford j
Red. It would be as logical for a I
mother to put the care and training i
of her child for the first six years j
of its life in the hands of an utter !
stranger. This isn't merely my j
theory; a good percentage of those '
who are being let in now as trans- j
fers couldn't get in as freshmen. If '
it is as easy for a transfer to get in j
as it appears, it is certain that Stan- j
ford's scholastic prestige will be j
hurt, and is being hurt.
It seems to me and to most of !
those with whom I have talked on
this matter that to let in a freshman
class of 500 and cut down on the
number of transfers would solve
what will soon.be a major problem.
The administration of the Univer
sity in everyday matters is not the !
concern of the students or alumni, j
But since the University is com- j
posed of three groups, faculty, I
alumni, and students, I think thai/
all three groups should have a say
in large questions of policy. While
the students should never presume
to dictate to those in authority, their |
opinion should have some weight in
University affairs. I therefore re- j
spectfully propose a Quad referen
dum to get student opinion on the |
retention of the Lower Division and
a freshman class of 500.

In spite of the 32 to G defeat of |
Dartmouth at Boston Saturday I be- |
lieve all signs indicate that Stan- j
ford's position at the top in athletics i
is gone. If the Dartmouth game
means anything it means that the
Warner system is poison to any
team that hasn't faced it year after
year, and that with it Pop can beat
the strongest teams in the East with
mediocre material. But to win. on
the coast, where the system is j
known, it takes a little more than j
it took in Boston. I think Pop's |
system is the greatest in America
because its mixture of deception and
power brings results with a mini
mum of effort. But even Warner j
needs a fair amount of material to i
work with. Where would Southern J
California be by this time if with j
his reliance of sheer power Coach
j Jones had had to get his material
for the last three years from fresh
man classes of 300? The wdnder has
been that the Indians have stayed
near the top so long. Menlo J.C. has
something to do with it, but we j
can't depend on Pop and on Menlo
to keep us in the conference much
longer. Pop may retire, and Menlo
kids may decide to go somewhere
