DEVOTION—At the New Menlo \
Theatre.
"Devotipn" is an extraordinarily
able film version of a novel which !
was practically worthless. This was
undoubtedly due lirst to the ability ;
of Ann Harding and second to a ;
well-picked cast. l
The plot is an extremely unlikely ,
one of a little home body, Ann
Harding, putting on a wig and ridi
culous clothes and going, as a gov- ,
erness to his son, into the home of
a promising lawyer with whom she
has fallen in love. The results are
only too obvious.
But the acting of the heroine puts
the picture on a really high plane.
It is difficult to analyze just what it
is in Ann Harding that makes her
so outstandingly good. It is probably
the fact that there is nothing thea
trical'about her. She is probably the
only woman in Hollywood who
seems real without any of that
highly polished, over-coiffeured
artificiality that characterizes the
other so-called luminosities of the
film world.
The English accents are, as usual,
a little too thick, the youngest mem
ber of the cast, a little boy, appar
ently being the only real English
man in the lot. —S.C.A.
RICH MAN'S FOLLY—At the New
Stanfor r! Theatre.
George Bancroft again, in a bit
of rather superb acting. As a highly
successful shipbuilder, with a hun
dred and fifty years of family tradi
tion behind him in his trade, he
lives for further accomplishment,
and for a son who may carry on tra
dition into an almost identical,
though a smoother-going future. In j
his desire for power for his son's j
name, he neglects the boy's own '
safety and happiness, neglects his j
wife, and his daughter, and every- j
thing else but money, til! everything
falls away and leaves him nothing
except this power.
The piece is a little over-acted in
parts—at least the characters are
forced by their lines into seeming

over-action. And Mr. Bancroft's di- j
lectors seem to have a mania for
introducing disappointing anti
climaxes after the play has actually {
reached its logical point of conclu- j
sion. The whole picture leans dan
gerously toward melodrama, but the '
more emotional spots are so smooth
ly put across that the possibly ridi- i
culous is raised to an admirable i
level. —S.D.
LASCA OF THE RIO GRANDE—
At the Varsity Theatre.
Aside from a wretchedly cumber
some plot, weak atmosphere, and j
feeble by-play, Leo Carrillo, Dor- I
othy Burgass, and John Mack Brown
put on a good show.
Carrillo is again his inimitable j
self as the suave Latin gentleman j
who speekie de inglese so ver' prett.' j
He is no longer the maganimous, i
simple-hearted Lombardi but an '
unscrupulous cattleman of the bor
derland.
Dorothy Burgass, whom we |
don't remember ever having seen !
before, is swell. She does her Car
menesque role to perfection, smil- :
ing at one admirer while winking ;
at another five minutes after killing j
still another. And she casts an en- j
tirely new light on the way to say i
please.
It amazes us that a picture, in j
which the direction is both delicate j
and finished, should present such j
incongruities as a very unconvincing
storm which only registered every
five or six shots and for the intro
duction of which we could discover
no possible reason. —E.T.P.
