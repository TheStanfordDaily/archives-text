TODAY'S SCHEDULE
Phi Psi's vs. Betas, Fr.8.8., 3
o'clock
Fijis vs. El Cuadro, Grays'
field, l» o'clock
A.T.O. vs. Delta Chi,
15 o'clock ;
Sigma Nu vs. Phi Kaps, V.8.8.,
4 o'clock.
Opening the last week of inter-
Icague intramural football today,
the Phi Psi outfit takes on the Beta
team in the afternoon's outstanding
contest. A win for the former would
give them the League V champion
ship.
Complications in League IV will
be somewhat lessened when the
Sigma Nu-Phi Kap battle is over.
The winner will play the Phi Sig
team for the right to enter the semi
fin al.s.
A.T.O. Faces Delta Chi
A.T.O. takes on the Delta Chi
team in a battle that should return
Ihe former a winner in League VI.
If Delta Chi can stop the A.T.O.'s
fast running attack the Theta Chi
outfit will get another chance in a
playoff.
In the fourth game of the day the
Fijis are favored to take El Cuadro
into camp without much trouble.
The possibility of numerous play
offs makes the job of predicting
finalists difficult, but it looks as if
ihe Alpha Delts and the winners of
League IV ought to get through to
the last round.
Alpha Belts Strong
The Alpha Delts have a strong
running attack built . around the
flashy George Naylon, and can back
it up with a good aerial game. They
came through League II without a
defeat, and that included a victory
over last year's champion Sigma Chi
outfit.
Any one of the three possible
finalists from League IV, Phi Sigs,
Sigma Nu, and Phi Kaps, is capable
of giving them a good argument.
The Phi Sigs have the fast Ward
well brothers in their lineup, and
Ihey haye been stopped only once.
The Phi Kaps held Ihem on a wet
field, and emerged with a close 2-0
victory.
The only visible block to this pos
sible final is the winner of League
V. An underestimated Phi Psi team
is fighting it out with the Breakers
and Betas, and the victor will be
hard to beat. The Betas have Ketron
and White, and the Breakers have
the Phillipi family. Phi Psi is an
evenly balanced outfit with no out
standing players, and, so far, no
defeats.
The Shysters vs. Theta Chi game,
originally scheduled for today, was
forfeited by the lawyers when it
was changed to last Tuesday. This
gives the Row-men a chance at a
playoff for the League VI title if
ihe Delta Chi outfit can upset the
A.T.O.'s this afternoon.

team for the right to enter the semi
fin al.s.
A.T.O. Faces Delta Chi
A.T.O. takes on the Delta Chi
team in a battle that should return
Ihe former a winner in League VI.
If Delta Chi can stop the A.T.O.'s
fast running attack the Theta Chi
outfit will get another chance in a
playoff.
In the fourth game of the day the
Fijis are favored to take El Cuadro
into camp without much trouble.
The possibility of numerous play
offs makes the job of predicting
finalists difficult, but it looks as if
ihe Alpha Delts and the winners of
League IV ought to get through to
the last round.
Alpha Belts Strong
The Alpha Delts have a strong
running attack built . around the
flashy George Naylon, and can back
it up with a good aerial game. They
came through League II without a
defeat, and that included a victory
over last year's champion Sigma Chi
outfit.
Any one of the three possible
finalists from League IV, Phi Sigs,
Sigma Nu, and Phi Kaps, is capable
of giving them a good argument.
The Phi Sigs have the fast Ward
well brothers in their lineup, and
Ihey haye been stopped only once.
The Phi Kaps held Ihem on a wet
field, and emerged with a close 2-0
victory.
The only visible block to this pos
sible final is the winner of League
V. An underestimated Phi Psi team
is fighting it out with the Breakers
and Betas, and the victor will be
hard to beat. The Betas have Ketron
and White, and the Breakers have
the Phillipi family. Phi Psi is an
evenly balanced outfit with no out
standing players, and, so far, no
defeats.
The Shysters vs. Theta Chi game,
originally scheduled for today, was
forfeited by the lawyers when it
was changed to last Tuesday. This
gives the Row-men a chance at a
playoff for the League VI title if
ihe Delta Chi outfit can upset the
A.T.O.'s this afternoon.
