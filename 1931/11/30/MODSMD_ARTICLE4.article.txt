# BROADCAST OF DEBATE HELD FEAT
## Conn and Huneke Comment On Unique Experience Of Radio Talks 
### 
Throughout the nation speakers
i from Stanford and Harvard were
! heard last Friday noon when the
I first transcontinental intercollegiate
| radio debate was held over a net
! work of stations of the Columbia
i Broadcasting System.
Speaking for Stanford from KFRC
in San Francisco were Howard
j Conn and John Huneke, varsity de
' baters. As their opponents at the
i Boston end of the broadcast were
' Malcolm Hoffman and Jerrald Rus
kin, representing Harvard Univer
j sity.
"Perhaps the most interesting as
pect of the debate was the speaking
jin a contest with unseen adver
' saries," was the comment of Howard
Conn on the broadcast. "Never hav
j ing spoken over the radio and then
j to speak to a national audience was
! a big thrill. It might be interesting
to others to learn that we wex*e told
j that it took one person a whole
i week to arrange the broadcast from
: this end. Everything was timed to
i the exact second and there was no
running over in your talk. We were
' pleased with the courtesy shown by
I operatives at the station and the
j smoothness of running so intricate
â–  a machine."
"Publicity on a large scale was
attained by Stanford in this broad
cast," said John Huneke. "The re
sponse to the request for opinions
of the radio public on reception of
1 the talks will be interesting to us.
I We didn't learn the number of sta
-1 tions in the broadcast but are to be
I informed later from the New York
! office of the sponsors."
That federal centralization is im
minent with the majority of prob
j lems confronting the public tend
| ing to become national would be one
of the facts gained from the talks.
; The Harvard speakers argued the
i depression into an outstanding fac-
J tor to substantiate increase in cen-
I tral government.
| Accompanying the two Stanford
men to San Francisco for the con
j test, Wardell Duggan, assistant de
i bate manager, Lee Chapin, assistant
debate coach, and Joseph Wolf, al-
I ternate for the debate, formed the
visual audience for a broadcast that
1 assumes major proportions in Amer
j ican college forensic circles.
