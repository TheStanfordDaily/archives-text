# SOCCERMEN BEGIN PREPARATION FOR S.F.U. ENCOUNTER
## Win Over Bay City Team Would Mean Unbeaten Record For Cards 
### Dick Strouse 
With the California Intercollegiate
, Soccer Conference championship al
| ready won and with a chance to
i keep the season's record clear of ;
: defeats, the Stanford varsity soccer j
men will start intensive" preparation j
j today for their game with S.F.U. i
' this Saturday in San Francisco,
j The Hilltoppers boast a powerful j
I team this year whose record is only j
surpassed by that of Stanford and, !
i with the Indians, they form the !
; class of the league. S.F.U. has suf- j
| fered its only defeat at the hands, j
' or rather feet, of California, and has j
1 been tied by California and San |
Mateo J.C. However, the S.F.U.- j
I Stanford game also resulted in a j
! tie, so that Saturday's kicking con- j
I test is by no means a set-up for the i
i Indians.
The prospects of an undefeated I
j season are particularly pleasing to |
; Coach Maloney and his squad be- :
■ | cause of the scarcity of good soccer ;
; i teams at Stanford in recent years, j
' ! Maloney has strained his memory i
| ! in vain to recollect another Stanford !
I ! eleven that has gone through an en- j
j tire season with a clean slate, and j
| his recollection of a championship \
! pennant waving gayly over the |
, i men's locker room is equally ob- j
r ! scure. Hcnce the extreme import- I
t ! ance of the game with the Hilltop- j
: ! pers.
. | The team will, with possibly one j
. I exception, be in the best of condition i
. i for Saturday's contest. The one ex- I
i ception is Bill Mearns, who has an !
. ; injured knee that may keep him on
. the bench instead of on the field j
! operating from his visual position of I
• j outside right. Mearns' injury was
i I incurred during the last California
1 ; contest.
t Hard practice sessions including i
| daily scrimmages are the order of j
the week, according to Manager
i Singer, as the team wants that un
i defeated record. And there is still a I
? chance that the travel-loving soc
: ; cerites will make that trip to Can-
I ada after all.
