GOAT one week, hero the next.
That was Frankie Wilton Pop's
spry halfback of a few seasons back,
and it was Ernie Caddel in the clos
ing games of this year's schedule.
Ernie had more than an off day in
the Big Game. He dropped passes
that should have netted long gains
and in general made himself a
minus quantity. Once he did a beau
tiful job of "tight rope walking"
along the sideline, but it hardly
made up for his boots.
Then, on the first play against
Dartmouth, Kaydle (as Bill Mundy
called him) trotted 72 yards to a
touchdown. Later in the period he
| traveled through lackle and 63
I yards to another score. Not satisfied
i with that, he nabbed a pass in the
{ final quarter to add one more
touchdown to Stanford's mounting
I score.
Those surprised Bostonians gave
j him an ovation when he left the
I field near the end of the game, and
! it must have been sweet music to
j his ears, after being a goat just a
j week previous.
I
EVERYBODY'S doing it, and we
! can't be an exception to the rule.

That was Frankie Wilton Pop's

ing games of this year's schedule.
Ernie had more than an off day in
the Big Game. He dropped passes
that should have netted long gains
and in general made himself a
minus quantity. Once he did a beau
tiful job of "tight rope walking"
along the sideline, but it hardly
made up for his boots.
Then, on the first play against
Dartmouth, Kaydle (as Bill Mundy
called him) trotted 72 yards to a
touchdown. Later in the period he

i with that, he nabbed a pass in the
{ final quarter to add one more
touchdown to Stanford's mounting
