# WHO HAS A GRIP ON DISAPPEARING SACK MATERIAL?
## 
### 
Who has the grip on that
well-known material used for
gunny-sacks?
That is what the Concert
Series Office would like to
know.
The Office loaned a piece of
burlap 40 feet long by 40 inches
wide to cover up some rowing
machines and other mechanical
enhancers of that girlish figure
at the Sophomore Cotillion.
The burlap was stolen and
later returned. Now it is miss
ing again and its return is re
quested as it is needed for the
concert Wednesday night.
In other words, the Concert
Series Office is holding the
burlap because the burlap is
missing, if you can figure that
out.
