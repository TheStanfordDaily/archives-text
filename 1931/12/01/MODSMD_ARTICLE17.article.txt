And thus we find another tradi
tion broken. After four years of
j privation and self-denial inmates of
| the frosh dorm were treated to a
i rare banquet of beer and pretzels
i Sunday evening. Acchhhh, yaah!
i Und chees mit crackers too, also
| and in addition to the regular sump
tuous repast.
Who, why, or what nobody both
' ered to ask .... but the fact re
mains that in spite of prohibition,
constitutions, and other minor dis-
I orders, the Stanford rough once
again has come into his own. Even
though the enticing liquid gurgled
and bubbled and foamed with prom
j ise it was all perfectly nice and re

| spectable according to Encina au
thorities It appears to have
come from a prominent local brew
ery (licensed by the government)
J manufacturing nothing but "light"
: beverages.
According to 215'.; members of
j the dining clubs present to partake
' of the banquet, the most delightful
sensation of all was encountered in
the tickling effect of Ihe essencc
on the nostrils during the process
i of consumption. It was stated that
llhe pretzels aided in this to a con
! siderable degree.
Although the novelty of the cheese
(not limburger) was somewhat
overshadowed by the advent of the
foreign (?) importations, an unusu-
I ally good time was declared to be
! had by«all. Especially about 7 o'clock
that evening when bottles were
heard popping in the famous En
| cina bull-pen.
