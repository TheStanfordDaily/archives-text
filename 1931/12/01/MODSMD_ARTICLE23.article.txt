An unusual series of organ re
cital programs is announced by
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist. Tomorrow, at 5:10 o'clock, the
first, of seven programs of music by
J. S, Bach is to be offered. The series
will continue on Tuesday and
Thursday of next week, and the four
concluding recitals will be given in
January. During these recitals, "The
Little Organ Book," a series of.
forty-five chorale preludes based
upon Lutheran chorales, will be
played in its entirety. The six trio
sonatas will also be presented.

poetic and spiritual side of Bach
as revealed in these short master
pieces. At each recital a chorale will
be sung by a few picked singers
from the University Choir, and the
"Chorale-Prelude" giving Bach's
musical interpretation of the text
will follow.
