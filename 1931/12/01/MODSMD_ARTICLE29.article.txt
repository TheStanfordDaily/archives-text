The much discussed mailer of faculty-student relation
ship comes in to l!ie while glare of publicity once again,
with two indications of tlie interest in that relationship
manifesting themselves in widely separated areas.
New students entering Rrown University, at Providence,
Rhode Island, are presented with a Who's Who in which
are listed all Ihe members of the faculty, together with a
short account of the degrees, professional experience, and
principal avocations of each.
This plan, as it lias been worked out, enables the stu
dents to consider the temperament of the professor as well
as the desirability of including bis course in their program.
The individual professor's personality and technique are
of great importance i:t estimating the value to the student
to be derived from lectures and classes.
At Ml. Hood, in Oregon, an unusual conference is
planned to permit student and professor to enter into gen
eral discussion of the two topics, "What's Wrong with the
Faculty," and "What's Wrong with the Students."
11 is more than possible that some particularly fortunate
or far-seeing individual will put his linger on the sore spot
in student-faculty relations, and in so doing, exercise the
power of the magic wand. 11 is not too idealistic to visual
ize a state of affairs in which required attendance at classes
would be only an unpleasant memory.
Maybe something could be done which would impress
the student with a sense of real loss at missing a lecture,
and by the same token, maybe Ihe professor could realize
that attendance is the result of something more than com
pulsion; that he has succeeded in reaching and holding the
interest of his classes.
Reside the question of compulsory attendance, there is
with us always, like death and taxes, the old problem of
grades and the grade-hunters. The student world would
he forever indebted to the individual or to the group who
can suggest a workable, satisfactory substitute for the
grade system which will eliminate our present plague of
apple polishing and quibbling.
The outlook is hopeful; with so many people interested,
with so much thinking being done about these problems, it
is more than likely thai an adequate solution will be dis
covered and put to use.
