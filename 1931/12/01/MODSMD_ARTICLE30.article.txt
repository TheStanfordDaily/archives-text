### 
The All-Ameriean selection is upon us. From now until
New Year's Day, tlie sport-loving public will get a chance
to read what the Four Forks Herald considers the eleven I
best football players in the United States, or what Coach
Harry Ape of Pismo Beach Tech thinks is an All-American
array, no more than three of the men being Pismo Beach
Tech stars.
Of course, the practice is harmless enough, but it is l
equally meaningless. Xo one not even the groups of
coaches who pick up a little ready change by making se
lections can see all the teams, and therefore cannot pick
a real All-American team, even if it were possible. Why j
not be sensible and confine the post-season exercises to the
selection of regional all-star teams—selections that will
carry some weight with the reading public?
The Stanioiu) Daily entertains no delusions of grandeur '
icgarding its status among college papers. But today it
would like to point out that it was the only college publi
cation on the Pacific Coast, and probably in the United
States, that did not run a Thanksgiving editorial in its col
umns last week. Let us give thanks!
"Restriction of fraternity social activities at the Uni
versity of California was demanded by the Pan-Hellenic
Mothers' Club in a letter which the organization sent to the
Inferfraternity Council. Lack of adequate supervision was
the charge." So says a news item which reached the Daii.y
office.
We didn't see THAT in the Ddihj "Cal."
The last editorial staff meeting will be held today at
1 o'clock, and all unexcuscd absentees will be guillotined.
This is a benefit performance, proceeds going to charity.
