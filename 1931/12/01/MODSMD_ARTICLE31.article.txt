# BULL SESSION
## AN EDITOR'S LOT IS NOT A HAPPY ONE 
### 
Whether Gilbert or Sullivan wrote
the above is not quite clear in the
mind of the writer, but the truth
of it was never more apparent as
he sits pondering what the hell to
write about pending the recovery
of Abe Mcllinkoff, varsity Bull Ses
sioner. ,
To tell the truth, MellinkofE did
write a Bull Session to be published
today, but the editor discovered, at
the last moment, that the article
was pornographic, incoherent, and
incorrect. Therefore, the article was
thrown into the wastcbasket (ha,
ha) and MellinkofT informed that he
was to write another and keep it
clean. He refused outright, leaving
the editor holding the well-known
sack.
Of course the editor MIGHT write
about the Lower Division, or the
Women's Council, or the Call-Bul
letin, with dire results. The editor
'■jnight also have directed one of the
hired hands to write the Bull Ses
sion, with no results whatsoever.
One of the drawbacks to being edi
tor is the fact that nobody but
yourself realizes how much author
ity the position carries.
Another drawback is the fact that
everyone suspects an ulterior mo
tive in everything the editor does.
For example, the Daily was accused
l of receiving money from the Ameri
; can Tobacco Company for running
I editorials defending co-ed smoking.
I That is ridiculous, unfortunately.

I Another bad feature is the fact
| that a monetary set-up in the
J Argus-eyed supervision invariably
' results in some neophyte gumming
j the works. Only the other night the
i edtior, worn out with his ceaseless
I vigil at the office, went home to
I snatch a few hours' sleep. The next
! morning he awoke to find that a
i tryoutee named Hoolihan or Sulli
j van had inserted in the paper the
I picture of a movie star, under the
I caption, "Beauty 111." The beauty
'had been dead three days. Verily,
' to be an editor, one must "sleep on
| the files and eat ink."
| The copy desk, where eager jour
j nalists gather to play bridge, is the
] reason for most of the editor's
j wrinkles. His only consolation is the
knowledge that most of the people
I on the copy desk eventually get to
I be editor.
' What is laughingly callcd the Edi
| torial Board is supposed to assist
j the editor in running the paper. The
| present editorial board consists of
| two men and two women. An aver
j age of one idea in seven days eman
jates from the quartet and is prompt
j ly thrown out the window. Unfor
| tunately, the window is not large
1 enough to permit the passage of
I large, inert bodies, such as the Edi
torial Board.
Well, this is the first and last sub
stitute Bull Session. Come home,
I Mellirikoff, all is forgiven.
