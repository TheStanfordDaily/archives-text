Every one wondered why all
; Elaine's friends left her; why they
! came one night and no more. Did
j she send them away or did they
leave? I found the answer one night
when Elaine was in a communi
| cative mood.
"Flaws, flaws in every one of
them," she said, her eyes drooping
| sadly.
"Take Bill. A fine young man, and
attractive. Yet after the first date
I had to send him away. Black
heads. And there was Jack
"Even his best friends?" I sug
! gested.
"No, B. O. Harry was the nicest,
i though. I loved him, wanted to
i marry him. But when he proposed
I had to refuse. You see, he didn't
have any sox appeal. He just
| wouldn't wear garters."
"And Tom?"
She brightened. "Yes, I was des
! perately in love with him. He had
Appetite Appeal, took me out to

dinners. But one night his first
words betrayed him. What would
you think if your husband used bad
grammar?"
I tried to explain that I did not
anticipate taking a husband, but she
hurried on.
'"Then there was Tony. I doubt if
he even had any good friends. His
was the Unforgiveable Fault."
"And the others?"
"Well, Paul—always that morning
shave. Don—no stacomb. Jim —film
on his teeth. Dave—no P.A., person
al appearance, you know. Frank—
didn't smoke Old Golds. And so it
went."
She was weeping. I rose to go,
yet doubting her story. Were none
of these lost loves her fault?
The revelation came when I saw
her throw herself on the sofa.
Elaine was wealthy; she took all her
exercise on the davenport.
Undoubtedly she had Athlete's
Foot.
