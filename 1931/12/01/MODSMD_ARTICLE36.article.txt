| TWENTY-FIVE MODERN PLAYS I
—Edited by S. Marion Tucker, j
Harper & Brothers. (At the Stan- I
fort? Bookstore.)
Professor Tucker, who has edited I
several collections of plays and I
verse, introduces "Twenty-Five )
; Modern Plays" with high praise of :
j the present-day dramatic output. |
; Defining modern drama as ihat •
j which is the result of the renais- '
j sance in the last half of the nine
teenth century, he considers the
production as a whole to be "ex
ceedingly rich" and unequalled by |
that of any previous period. Al- i
though we have neither a Sophocles '
nor a Shakespeare today Tucker
believes that there is a large num
ber of good playwrights.
Six of the plays are by American
authors, O'Neill being considered j
our best by the editor. Of all his 1
work Tucker chose to represent !
O'Neill with "The Great Cod
j Brown." He considers it typical both !
I as to manner and technique.
The plays are all by dramatists
who are generally conceded to be j
masters. Reasons are given for the
choice of each playwright and each !
play. Tucker says of Wilde's "The !
Importance of Being Earnest," for i
instance: "That this flippant piece \
j of studied insincerity should be a
j sincere work of art is a paradox."
—E.T.P.
j TIIE BROKEN WING—At the Al
cazar, San Francisco.
A big hand for Leo Carrillo as j
j the Mexican bandit-general. He is ;
I "ver' dam' goocL" He looks the part, ■
he talks the part, and he does jus- l
, tice to it in a big way. A piece of '
! dialect stuff between the second and i
| third acts is a little long, but does i
' not dctract.
About the only thing wrong with j
| this play is Dale Winter, who is by I
I far the best actress in the outfit, j
J The trouble lies with her being in :
j the leading role (often the difficulty I
ir. a Duffy play), regardless of her j
1 not being suited to the part. She
'just doesn't convince as a love-sick
Mexican country girl. She does j
j make the most of a bad situation, j
j though, especially in the two or j
j "three dramatic moments.
j The cast as a whole is very good, j
| the scenery is excellent, and an
i airplane crash is quite effective.

—Edited by S. Marion Tucker, j

fort? Bookstore.)
Professor Tucker, who has edited I
several collections of plays and I
verse, introduces "Twenty-Five )
; Modern Plays" with high praise of :
j the present-day dramatic output. |
; Defining modern drama as ihat •
j which is the result of the renais- '
j sance in the last half of the nine
teenth century, he considers the
production as a whole to be "ex
ceedingly rich" and unequalled by |
that of any previous period. Al- i
though we have neither a Sophocles '
nor a Shakespeare today Tucker
believes that there is a large num
ber of good playwrights.
Six of the plays are by American
authors, O'Neill being considered j
our best by the editor. Of all his 1
