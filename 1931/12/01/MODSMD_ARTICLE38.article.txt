IF HARVARD had not succumbed :
to Albie Booth's educated toe and j
taken the short end of a 3 to 0 (
score in their final game with Yale, |
ihc Cambridge eleven would have j
had a great chance to coast into the I
national '"championship," especially !
it Tulane meets a setback at the i
hands of Washington State this Sat
urday or U.S.C. in the Rose Bowl !
Ramc.
Yet Harvard was LUCKY to get j
a 7 to 6 decision over Dartmouth, a :
pass in the closing minutes of play j
giving them their lone touchdown, j
And what Stanford didn't do to
Dartmouth! The eastern critics ad
mit the Crimson would have met a
similar fate Saturday.
All of which shows how much this |
national title business amounts to, ;
but it's an interesting game for long j
winter evenings.
NOW TULANE, by virtue of i
being the only remaining un- j
defeated, untied team in the i
country, is regarded as the most
logical candidate for the mythi
cal honors. To prove their point,
however, the Southerners will
have to beat first Washington j
State, which they arc favored to
do, and then Southern Califor
nia on New Year's.
Southern Methodist has only
a muddy scoreless tie with
Texas Christian to mar their
record, hut St. Mary's may do
something about that this week.
Now IF St. Mary's downs
Southern Methodist, and IF Tu
lane is dumped, and IF Howard
Jones' Trojans continue their
impressive showing to the end
of the season, U.S.C. will get
our vote for the pennant.
That despite the fact that the
Trojans fell to the Galloping
Gaels at the rust of the season.
St. Mary's was better prepared
for that fray, and then wasn't
impressive in winning from a
team that was just getting or
ganized.
THE IDEA is this: The Trojans
have shown themselves to be the
class of the coast. Their defeat of
Notre Dame puts them ahead of
anything in the Middle West, and
Stanford's victory over Dartmouth
is an indication of what they could
do in that sector.
That leaves only the South, and
if Southern Methodist and Tulane
are disposed of, whom do you find
resting on the pinnacle but this
same U.S.C. eleven?
All of which should earn us an
honorary membership in the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

are disposed of, whom do you find
resting on the pinnacle but this
same U.S.C. eleven?
All of which should earn us an

Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
IF HARVARD had not succumbed :
to Albie Booth's educated toe and j
taken the short end of a 3 to 0 (
score in their final game with Yale, |
ihc Cambridge eleven would have j
had a great chance to coast into the I
national '"championship," especially !
it Tulane meets a setback at the i
hands of Washington State this Sat
urday or U.S.C. in the Rose Bowl !
Ramc.
Yet Harvard was LUCKY to get j
a 7 to 6 decision over Dartmouth, a :
pass in the closing minutes of play j
giving them their lone touchdown, j
And what Stanford didn't do to
Dartmouth! The eastern critics ad
mit the Crimson would have met a
similar fate Saturday.
All of which shows how much this |
national title business amounts to, ;
but it's an interesting game for long j
winter evenings.
NOW TULANE, by virtue of i
being the only remaining un- j
defeated, untied team in the i
country, is regarded as the most
logical candidate for the mythi
cal honors. To prove their point,
however, the Southerners will
have to beat first Washington j
State, which they arc favored to
do, and then Southern Califor
nia on New Year's.
Southern Methodist has only
a muddy scoreless tie with
Texas Christian to mar their
record, hut St. Mary's may do
something about that this week.
Now IF St. Mary's downs
Southern Methodist, and IF Tu
lane is dumped, and IF Howard
Jones' Trojans continue their
impressive showing to the end
of the season, U.S.C. will get
our vote for the pennant.
That despite the fact that the
Trojans fell to the Galloping
Gaels at the rust of the season.
St. Mary's was better prepared
for that fray, and then wasn't
impressive in winning from a
team that was just getting or
ganized.
THE IDEA is this: The Trojans
have shown themselves to be the
class of the coast. Their defeat of
Notre Dame puts them ahead of
anything in the Middle West, and
Stanford's victory over Dartmouth
is an indication of what they could
do in that sector.
That leaves only the South, and
if Southern Methodist and Tulane
are disposed of, whom do you find
resting on the pinnacle but this
same U.S.C. eleven?
