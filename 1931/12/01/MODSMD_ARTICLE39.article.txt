# SOCCER TEAM MAY ENTER S.F.U. GAME WITH FULL POWER
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team will,
with the possible exception of Bill
Mearns, present its regular lineup
in the all-important game with
S F.U. this Saturday in San Fran
cisco.
Mearns's leg injury, that spoiled
a perfectly good evening by pre
venting him from walking on Big
Game night, may also prevent his
playing Saturday, in which case
Bednar will start at outside right.
Kneeht, whose performance in the
third California game was as good
as any turned in by a league wing
all year, will play outside left.
Captain Falk and Ted Beggs will
operate as usual from the inside
posts, and Art Hearn will be at
center. The infection in Hearn's
famous "scoring toe" that was ag
gravated in the Cal game has com
pletely healed, and Art should
again be the team's chief scoring
threat.
Moore, Plumb, and Hayes are
ready to star from their halfback
positions, and Brekelbaum and
Holmes will play fullback. Jimmie
Webster, the league's best goalie,
should help make S.F.U. scores few
and far between.
