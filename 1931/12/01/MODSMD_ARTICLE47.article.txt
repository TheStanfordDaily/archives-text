Topping their march to the League
V championship, the Phi Psi outfit
yesterday turned back the Betas,
14-0, in their intramural grid game.
Bill Wood scored first for the win
ners when he raced around left end
for 25 yards. The conversion was
Latimer to Perelli-Minetti.
Phi Psi's final tally came near the
start of the second period when A1
Ray took Virg Dowell's pass on the
goal line.
The Phi Kaps gained the right to
meet Phi Sigma Kappa for the
League IV honors when they de
cisively trounced the Sigma Nu
team 9-0. Martin took Westsmith's
pass for the first score, and Irsfeld
booted a nice drop-kick between
the uprights for the other three
points.
The Sigma Nu attack was sadly
lacking without the direction of
Deuel, their chief scoring threat.
A.T.O. cinched the League VI
leadership when they buried the
Delta Chis under a 31-0 landslide.
Arbuckle scored twice on runs
through left tackle, threw to Clarke
for another, and to Goss for a con
version. Clarke tallied again around
right end, and Goss intercepted a
Delta Chi pass.
