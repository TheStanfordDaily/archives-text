# BEN EASTMAN APPROACHES UNOFFICIAL WORLD'S RECORD IN 352-YARD RACE
## 
### 
The joy of all sports writers —Ben
Sastman—yesterday again turned in
he kind of sensational performance
hat simply cannot be kept out of
he headlines. Acting Head Coach
3ill Ellington asked the hurdlers
ind sprinters to run 352 yards for
jndurance, and Big Ben obligingly
sauntered apparently effortlessly
around the track to win his heat
oy 20 yards.
Mechanically, Ellington looked at
lis watch, and then announced to
he startled world of track that
Eastman's time was :36.8. This mark
s three-tenths of a second slower
han Les Hables' unofficial world's
record and was made in the fall
quarter, whereas Hables ran his
memorable race in the spring just

( before the start of the regular track
i season. In addition, and with all due
! reverence for the men who started
with Eastman yesterday, Ben really
I had no competition as he assumed
■ a 15-yard lead after the first 30
J yards of the race had been nego
! tiated.
Les Hables himself, the invalid
who refuses to admit that he is sick,
also ran yesterday and barely beat
out Jimmy Willson in another 352.
! Hables' time of :41.3 seconds is re-
I markable in view of his condition.
I A1 Blackman, who looks more and
! more like a coming sprint star every
| time he runs, won his heat in :40.3,
| which is good for any freshman
: track man. Dan Murphy was unable
' to do his best because of illness.
