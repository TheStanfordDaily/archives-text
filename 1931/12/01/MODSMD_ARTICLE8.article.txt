# STANFORD TEAM FLAYS ALIMONY
## U.C. Debaters Say Women Not Entirely Free 
### 
J Alimony was flayed by Stanford
! co-eds in the no-decision debate
I held last night in the Little Theatre
I between the women of Stanford and
j California.
"Resolved, that present-day ali
! mony laws are unfair to the men,"
| was the bone of contention. Mary-
Katherine Morris, '33, and Lucile
I Smith, '35, upheld the affirmative
j for Stanford. Their arguments were
1 based on their allegation that mod
j ern woman is economically equal
I to man.
Woman Independent
"The indefinite pensions which
| judges award the woman in divorce
suits do not consider her present
independence," said Miss Smith.
"Men all over the country are
groaning under the burden of ali
i mony. The woman becomes a para
| site while the husband pays and
j pays."
Miss Morris brought down the
j well-filled house by declaring, "Mil
lions for defense but not a cent for
j alimony." She maintained that im
i prisonment for failui'e to pay ali
' mony is comparable to the absurdity
1 of imprisonment for debt. Since af
j ter divorce modern woman may
' quickly become economically inde-
I pendent, she contended that alimony
' is unfair to the man.
Times Have Changed
"Times have changed," she con
| eluded, "and there is no longer any
j justice in a life dole for the woman,
i I am for equality for the man."
Jean Hufted and Eugenia Walsh
of California stated that modern
j women is not as thoroughly liber
; ated as she is thought to be since
| 90 per cent of American women are
i still housewives and there are over
j 80 per cent more men than women
in industry. They maintained
; throughout the argument that wom
; en remain today in a state inferior
j to that of men and should therefore
j be protected.
