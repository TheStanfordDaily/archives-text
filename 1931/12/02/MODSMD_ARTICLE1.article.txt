# STANFORD MAY LOSE WARNER STATES REPORT
## 'Old Fox' Glancing Around For More Promising Grid Position TEAM RETURNS ALONE Swain And Storey Unable To Confirm News 
### 
Stanford's "Old Fox of football,'
Pop Warner, is glancing around for
a new position in more promising
gridiron fields.
Wire reports from New York in
dicate that the Cardinal coach has
agreed to sign a contract with New
York University, replacing Chick
Meehan, and, while local authori
ties are inclined.to doubt the dis
patches, it is pretty definitely estab
lished that Pop has been consider
ing at least two other offers.
According to Mrs. Warner, Pop
intended to confer with representa
tives of the colleges concerned
while in the East on the trip to
Boston for the Dartmouth game.
N.Y.U., however, was not one of
those which he was considering.
No Statement Made
Acting President Robert E. Swain
yesterday declared that University
authorities knew nothing of any
plans which Warner may have
made or of his repoi*ted agreement
with N.Y.U. No shift in the Stan
ford coaching staff has been con
sidered, Swain said.
Dr. T. A. Storey, head of the
School of Physical Education, was
skeptical in regard to the Eastern
* dispatches, recalling the unfounded
rumor of a Pennsylvania offer to
Pop which came up at this time last
year.

Contemplates Change

However, Warner's recent com- J
merits on the falling off in football I
material here, due to curtailment of
the freshman class, have given rise
to a belief that he would like to I
shift the scene of his operations to j
a more favorable location.

Pop is not returning from Boston t
with the team but is expected to j
reach the campus Monday or Tues
day of next week.
