## 
### 
Telling of the humorous incidents
concerned with radio advertising
and the idiosyncrasies of the stars,
Stuart Elliott spoke before the Busi
ness Club last night in the weekly
dinner meeting in the Old Union.
Elliott was vice-president of the
Sperry Flour Company until four
months ago when he resigned to
take a position in a nation-wide ad
vertising organization.

The speaker has concerned him
self with the selling end of business
all of his life and is at present
handling radio programs exclusive
ly. "Twenty-five years ago the prin
ciple aim of business men was pro
duction, with selling holding a sec
ondary place; today it is directly
opposite, said Elliott.
