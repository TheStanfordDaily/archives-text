# DAILY REPORTER ANGLES WAY TO MOONEY HEARING
## 
### 
• Famous lawyers, their hands
full of credentials, fretted and
fumed. Two thousand other
people also pushed and shoved,
fretted and fumed. Even the
mayor of Stockton, a badge of
his importance on his coat
lapel, waited in line and fretted
and fumed.
And F. Gilchrist, Daily cor
respondent, eredentialless as
the day he was born, walked
past them all—even past the
mayor of Stockton—and sat
himself down between Mayor
Jimmy Walker of New York
and Governor Jimmy Rolph of
California, to listen to them
plead the case of Mooney.

And the biggest thrill F. Gwl
christ got all way, was when
he sat down, borrowed three
sheets of paper from the New
York Herald correspondent,
and said, in a very professional
tone of voice, "Which one of
these guys is Walker?" A grim,
bared-tooth glance was answer
enough.
