# New Ball Makes Golf A Man's Game Says Twiggs
## 
### 
Women are going to have one
awful time with the new golf ball
; adopted by the U.S.G.A. about three
| weeks ago, if the prophecy of Eddie
| Twiggs, Stanford pro, holds good,
i It is so big and heavy that they
' won't be able to get it off the fair-
I wayâ€”well, at least it will be a hard,
1 hard job.
"Anyone with a light swing, and
| that means almost every woman, is
j going to have a lot of trouble play
i ing the new ball," Twiggs declared,
j "It carries farther than the old
i light-weight, but it's a lot harder
to get off the fairway."
This ball is the second "new" ball
i adopted by the association in recent
years. The first change from Ihe
j original style was to increase the
size and decrease the weight, but
j so much howling was heard from
all sides then that it was finally
j decided to try again. This new "pill,"
1 which will become official on Janu
ary 1, is the same large size, but is
also as heavy as the original. It is
! 1.(58 inches in diameter, and weighs
1.(52 ounces, instead of 1.55, as here
tofore.
The main differences the player
| notices between the new and the

old are enumerated by Twiggs as
follows:
1. The new ball is about 10 yards
longer against the wind, and is
practically the same down wind.
2. In the wind it carries much
straighter than the old ball, and
does not "float" on the breeze.
3. It is better on long putts, espe
cially on side hills, because it takes
the roll much more quickly and
surely.
4. It is much harder to get off the
fairway, especially with the woods,
and does not leave the club so
quickly. On the tee this difference
is not noticed so much, but out in
Ihe grass its heavier weight makes
it settle down farther.
"The new ball will not be official
vintil the first of the year, but all the
coast tournaments have allowed its
optional use immediately," Twiggs
said. "On windy courses such as
Lakeside it will make all the dif
ference in the world, and probably
a great many golfers will be getting
used to it in these December tour
neys.
"There is no doubt but that the
association made a good move when
it adopted the new specifications."
