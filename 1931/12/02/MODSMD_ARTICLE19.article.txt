# INDIAN CONFAB CLOSES AFTER THREE MONTHS
## MacDonald Ignores Power Apportionment Among Hindu Races 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 1. (/Pjâ€”After de
j liberating nearly three months and
I spending almost $1,000,000, the sec
! ond India round-table conference
| ended today with India standing vir
! tually where she stood last January
] at the conclusion of the first con
! ference.
Although Prime Minister Mac
i Donald announced in his final
J speeech that great strides forward
had been made, the vital problem of
j apportioning power among the vari
j ous racial groups, which he admit
ted was the whole key to the suc
cess of the conference, apparently
was as far from settlement as ever.
Deals Lightly
In his address the Prime Minister
j dealt with Mahatma Gandhi with
j velvet gloves. But while he was
calling the National leader "My
Dear Mahatma," the Viceroy of
i India was preparing to handle any
j new subversive movement by Gand
: hi followers in the Bengal district
! with an iron fist.

! Immediate death or deportation
i for life is the penalty prescribed
: under new ordinances in Bengal for
; those who challenge King George's
i rule or attempt political crimes.
Demands Spurned
Several other highly controversial
questions in addition to the matter
I of apportioning power among racial
j groups remained unsolved at the
conclusion of the conference. Among
; these were the problem of safe
i guards for India's defense and fi-
I nances.
