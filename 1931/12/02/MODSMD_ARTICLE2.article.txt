# POLICE ROUT MOB IN DEMONSTRATION AT MOONEY MEET

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1. (A y )â€”
Charging horses and swinging night
sticks sent 2,000 men and women
in a mad flight from the City Hall
Plaza yesterday forenoon, resulted
in slight injury to three police of
ficers and the arrest of twenty-five
communists.
The riot appeared to be the out
come of a demonstration alike
against Governor Rolph and Mayor
James Walker of New York, and the
meeting that was being held in the
State Supreme Court rooms, where
the pardon of Thomas J. Mooney
was the issue.
About fifty men and women were
the direct cause of the display of
force by the police. The others were,
for the most part, orderly specta
tors. There were, too, 200 or so
who had marched to the plaza in
the communist parade, and who
stood languidly by while the leaders
urged direct action, and demanded
admittance to the pardon hearing.

Some of the crowd were bruised
by the plunging horses or night
sticks, and a few were bumped into
the plaza fountain.
