# Walker Demands Mooney Pardon In Last Appeal
## Governor Rolph Postpones Final Decision on Pardon Until After Consultation with Legal Advisers On All Past Records of Mooney Case SAPIRO CONCLUDES HEARING WITH SUMMARY Pleas for Freedom or Re-Trial as All Jurors Agree Conviction Based on Perjured Testimony 
### 
BUILDING, SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1.(/3 I ) — The Mooney pardon
hearing before Governor James Kolph, Jr., was concluded at this
afternoon with the summarization of the record of Aaron Sapiro, Asso
ciate Counsel. Mayor James J. Walker, of New York, followed his col
league. Frank P. Walsh, l.'l years an attorney for Mooney, who in a two
hour address, presented to Governor Kolph and his lawyer advisers,
Matt I. Sullivan and Louis Louis Byington, that Mooney could not have
been convicted without the testimony of Frank C. Oxman and John
McDonald, which the petitioner submitted was perjured.

Walker submitted that "this is a
case if there ever was a justification
of the pardon power.
Jury in Session
"The jury that convicted Mooney
still sits. The jury that said he was
guilty now says he is innocent.
"The judge who tried him, asking
for executive clemency, augmented
by the jurors themselves, who have
asked that this plea for a pardon
be granted.
"Can you or I think of a case by
the cold reasoning of the record
which more commends its€;lf to the
pardon power of this state?"
His voice broke as he held out
his hands toward the Supreme Court
bench where sat the Governor of
California and begged that the Gov
ernor "do justice where justice has
been denied."
Sapiro Sums Up
When Walker finished, Aaron
Sapiro, San Francisco and New York
lawyer, began the task of summing
up. Most of Sapiro's address was
devoted to analyzing the present
day positions and attitudes of the
trial officials in the light of subse
quent developments.
The foreman of the jury and all
the still living jurors, he said, have
subscribed to the theory that the
conviction was based on perjured
testimony and that a pardon should
therefore be forthcoming, or a new
trial granted. The remedy of a new
trial, he said, no longer lies in the
power of the courts —the Governor
is now the only court of appeal.

Details Studied
Governor Rolph announced thai
he would take no action until he
had consulted fully with his legal
advisers. Mr. Sullivan said that the
record would have to be studied in
detail before any worthwhile advice
could be given the Governor, so it
was indicated that a decision would
not be forthcoming for weeks or
even months.

up. Most of Sapiro's address was
devoted to analyzing the present
day positions and attitudes of the
trial officials in the light of subse
quent developments.
The foreman of the jury and all
the still living jurors, he said, have
subscribed to the theory that the
conviction was based on perjured
testimony and that a pardon should
therefore be forthcoming, or a new
trial granted. The remedy of a new
trial, he said, no longer lies in the
power of the courts —the Governor
is now the only court of appeal.

Details Studied
Governor Rolph announced thai
he would take no action until he
had consulted fully with his legal
advisers. Mr. Sullivan said that the
record would have to be studied in
detail before any worthwhile advice
could be given the Governor, so it
was indicated that a decision would
not be forthcoming for weeks or
even months.
BUILDING, SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1.(/3 I ) — The Mooney pardon

hour address, presented to Governor Kolph and his lawyer advisers,
Matt I. Sullivan and Louis Louis Byington, that Mooney could not have
been convicted without the testimony of Frank C. Oxman and John
McDonald, which the petitioner submitted was perjured.

Walker submitted that "this is a
case if there ever was a justification
of the pardon power.
Jury in Session
"The jury that convicted Mooney
still sits. The jury that said he was
guilty now says he is innocent.
"The judge who tried him, asking
for executive clemency, augmented
by the jurors themselves, who have
asked that this plea for a pardon
be granted.
"Can you or I think of a case by
the cold reasoning of the record
which more commends its€;lf to the
pardon power of this state?"
His voice broke as he held out
his hands toward the Supreme Court
bench where sat the Governor of
California and begged that the Gov
ernor "do justice where justice has
been denied."
