## Delegates From Japan And China Described 
### 
The unusual problems of this
year's conference of the Institute of
Pacific Relations were completely
discussed last night in the Assembly
Hall by Professor Joseph P. Cham
berlain of Columbia University, who
recently returned from the Fourth
Biennial Conference of the Institute
held in Shanghai.

"Rather than have the Institute
considered a fair-weather ship, the
Manchurian crisis was discussed,"

said Professor Chamberlain. "A con
ference without mention of this
problem was impossible, as it was
the thought uppermost in the minds
of all the delegates.

"There were many reasons why it
was difficult for Chinese and Japa
nese delegates to meet, but this feat
was accomplished, as a failure of
the conference now would be ad
mittance of the failure of our funda

Professor Chamberlain explained
the round-table method of holding
conferences, and added that the in
formal private talks between the
delegates from all the countries bor
dering Ihe Pacific were also of great
value in creating a better under
standing. He said that the various
prejudices, theories, and opposing
interpretations of the same facts are
brought out and cleared up at the
conferences.
There was a great deal of oratory,
but little of value accomplished at
the first Institute meetings, accord
ing to Professor Chamberlain. It
was found that the Institute must
be a collector of information, if it
were to become worthwhile. The

American colleges aided in this, and,
said Professor Chamberlain, "The
Institute owes more to Stanford
than to any other university in the

country."
The speaker was introduced by
Acting President Swain.
