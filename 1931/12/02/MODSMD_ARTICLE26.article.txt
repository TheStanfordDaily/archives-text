# A.W.S. WILL SUPPORT ACTION OF COUNCIL
## 
### 
Whole-hearted support for the
Women's Council's policy in regard
to drinking and its ban of women's
help in the building of this year's
bonfire, was promised by the
A.W.S. Conference in a meeting
held in the Women's Clubhouse yes
terday afternoon.
Since it was felt that the women
sponsors and Mi.ss Doyle, director
of Roble, had too much work to do
to be able to supervise women aid
ing in the freshman pyre, the Con
ference voted to uphold the action
of the Council this year.

To sec if revisions or corrections
were needed in their constitution,
the Conference selected a Constitu
tion Committee which includes
Anne Burnett, Miriam Strout, Mary
K. Morris, Jeanne Millard, and Bar
bara Beach Thompson, ex officio.
