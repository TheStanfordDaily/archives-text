From New York comes tlie unconfirmed report thai
Glenn S. Warner, for eight years the guiding hand of Stan
ford football, will go to Xew York rniversily as coach next
season.
Xo one in a position to know the facts is on the campus.
"Pop" himself, A! Masters, Don Licbendorfcrâ€” all are on
a westbound train that will not arrive here until Thursday
morning.
It is no secret that Warner is not entirely satisfied with
conditions at Stanford. The slashing of "the lower division
enrollment, Warner holds, has deprived Stanford of a
number of football players, and junior college transfers do
not entirely fill the gap.
During the past three or four years, there have been
rumors at the end of each season that Warner was leaving
Stanford. Two years ago, lie actually was dickering with
the I Diversity of Pennsylvania, but negotiations ultimately
fell through. This year, the first that a Warner-coached
team has lost to California, might be the psychological time
for a change.
At all events, the Daily prefers to believe that nothing
has been definitely settled yet, and that any announcement
of such a change will come from Warner himself, and not
from any eastern authorities. If "Pop" wants to leave, it
is Stanford's loss, for to him alone can Stanford give the
credit for its present football prestige.
