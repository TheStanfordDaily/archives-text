# A 						HOME CHARITY
## 
### 
Formerly tlic proceeds of the annual Christmas Seal
Drive, now under way on the campus, were sent to the na
tional headquarters for use in the war against tuberculosis.
This year the system lifts been changed and the money
donated by the students who buy these seals remains at
Stanford and is used directly for student benefit.
All tlie money collected during the drive will be turned
over to the Men's and Women's Rest Homes which care for
many students throughout the year.
Although the Drive lias always been worth while, giving
the funds to the rest homes brings its benefits directly to
the campus and students should be willing to contribute
even more generously than formerly.
Last year the goal was *.'5OO. This year the Drive chair
man hopes to belter that mark and the support of the stu
dents is necessary for the accomplishment of that achieve
ment.
"It is in our youth that our judgment is surest, when
as green young freshmen we enter college with unsullied
minds mid clean faces, those days when we know that right
is what we think, and that all the world is wrong, no com
promise, and no comparison." The Varsity, I Diversity of
Toronto.
