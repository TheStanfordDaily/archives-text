# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
So many people have asked to
read the "pornographic" Bull Ses
sion that the Editor claimed he cen
sored from yesterday's paper—that
in order to get a little rest and
peace, we are forced to bare our
Puritan soul to Ihe world, and lose
the smirkish respect and sudden
popularity that surrounds Havelock
Ellis, D. H. Lawrence, and their ilk,
by stating that the article was not
pornographic in the least. It wasn't
even as interesting as a Lucky
Strike advertisement featuring Jean
Harlow; one might say that it was
about as exciting as Marie Dressier
or Polly Moran.
In reality, the article was the kind
that capitalized the winds of free
dom into a small campus gale; the
editor was not afraid of the gale but
for certain tactical reasons, it was
felt that the gale the Bull Session
was about to unleash would be able
to do more than blow .some dust in
the eyes of certain powers-that-be.
By mutual consent, the editor sug
gesting and his humble servant con
senting, it was decided to postpone
the article to sometime in the very
near future. When the Editor said
he dropped the article in the waste
basket, he was only speaking figura
tively; he meant that he placed it
in the top right-hand drawer of his
desk. We do not plan to argue over
trivialities with the Editor; if he
says "wastebasket," then wastebas
ket it is.
The Editor might have called the
our door.
We had always maintained in
theory that "Banned in Boston"

EDITORS, BEWARE!

I article anything and nobody would
have cared, but the moment he used
"pornographic," our peaceful and
| private existence on this campus
ended. Some good friend, who sat
next to us in class four quarters
.■'go, pulled us from under our warm
blankets at an ungodly hour yester
. day morning to see the "dirty"
I article that had been banned. Peo
j pie who always had considered us
clean-minded, came around the
loom expecting banned books, select
: jokes, and interesting gossip.
When we tried to prove our inno
! cense and purity of soul, they
i thought we were "holding out" on
j them; our life has become miserable,
j If the Editor had held out an article
on the situation in Manchuria or
; even at Washington, nobody would
j have cared; but at the mere indica
! tion that something might have been
off-color a small path is beaten to
smeared over the cover, would sell
i "U.S. Statistical Abstract" to thou
! sands; "For adults only," or a "play
! for adult minds" will pack any
I theatre. Now, we can speak from
I sorrowful experience.
; Dear Editor, to make life livable
for rne once more—tell them all it
i was a joke. Call off your hounds; I
| beg forgiveness. You can call my
! stuff anything; but do not call it
i "pornographic" or anything that in
; timates anything like it.
—Abe Mellinkoff
Editor's Note: It was a joke. The
article was not obscene—merely
cataclysmic. But don't ever again
leave the job of Bull Sessioning to
i me.

for rne once more—tell them all it

—Abe Mellinkoff
Editor's Note: It was a joke. The
article was not obscene—merely
cataclysmic. But don't ever again
leave the job of Bull Sessioning to
i me.
So many people have asked to
read the "pornographic" Bull Ses
sion that the Editor claimed he cen
sored from yesterday's paper—that
in order to get a little rest and
peace, we are forced to bare our
Puritan soul to Ihe world, and lose
the smirkish respect and sudden
popularity that surrounds Havelock
Ellis, D. H. Lawrence, and their ilk,
by stating that the article was not
pornographic in the least. It wasn't
even as interesting as a Lucky
Strike advertisement featuring Jean
Harlow; one might say that it was
about as exciting as Marie Dressier
or Polly Moran.
In reality, the article was the kind
that capitalized the winds of free
dom into a small campus gale; the
editor was not afraid of the gale but
for certain tactical reasons, it was
felt that the gale the Bull Session
was about to unleash would be able
to do more than blow .some dust in
the eyes of certain powers-that-be.
By mutual consent, the editor sug
gesting and his humble servant con
senting, it was decided to postpone
the article to sometime in the very
near future. When the Editor said
he dropped the article in the waste
basket, he was only speaking figura
tively; he meant that he placed it
in the top right-hand drawer of his
desk. We do not plan to argue over
trivialities with the Editor; if he
says "wastebasket," then wastebas
ket it is.
The Editor might have called the
our door.
We had always maintained in
theory that "Banned in Boston"

EDITORS, BEWARE!

I article anything and nobody would
have cared, but the moment he used
"pornographic," our peaceful and
| private existence on this campus
ended. Some good friend, who sat
next to us in class four quarters
.■'go, pulled us from under our warm
blankets at an ungodly hour yester
. day morning to see the "dirty"
I article that had been banned. Peo
j pie who always had considered us
clean-minded, came around the
loom expecting banned books, select
: jokes, and interesting gossip.
When we tried to prove our inno
! cense and purity of soul, they
i thought we were "holding out" on
j them; our life has become miserable,

on the situation in Manchuria or
; even at Washington, nobody would
