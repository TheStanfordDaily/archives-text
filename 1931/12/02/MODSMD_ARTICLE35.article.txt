My dear Sir:
Granting that under the plan for
abolition of the Lower Division only i
those transfers whose work in the
junior colleges has reached a re
quired standard will be eligible for
admission to Stanford, nevertheless
it seems clear that the scholastic
level here will be lowered under the
system. A good record made com
petitively at a junior college seldom .
means so much as one made in high !
school for the reason that the best !
of the high-school graduates have j
gone on to a university. If men like i
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert, !
with their fine records in high 1
school, can attend any great uni- |
versity they choose, why .should
they spend two years at a junior
college? What will happen is that
California, U.S.C., and other uni
versities will get first choice from
the high-school graduates, and 1
Stanford will get the pick of v/hal j
is left.
Another thing, why the assump- ;
tion that students transferring from
junior colleges will be more likely
to succeed in graduate work than
those who spend two yearn in the
Lower Division at Stanford? Has
the Lower Division here been such j
a waste of time and money that its j
abolition is justified? Or has it been j
in the past a valuable period of J
orientation to true university life j
lhat can't be gotten in a "semi high I
school"? If the object is to save j
money for the graduate schools why [
not abolish the upper division too? I
There's hot much specialization j
there. —Gilbert Can*
