ADVENTURE!— By Carvcth Wells.
The John Day Company. 19*11. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
For once a book by an explorer
minus the usual picture of the big- !
game-hunting author standing non- J
chalantly with one foot on the neck 1
of his kill. Carveth Wells has too j
good a sense of humor to do this, i
His humor and bis faculty of mak- j
ing the truth sound like a lie, color
a delightful series of notes covering j
sketchily the lifetime experiences of j

a man who has gone into most of |
the corners of the globe with an eye !
for the unusual.
Here is a fish story which is both
scientifically true and typical of the '
book. Speaking of Malaysia, Wells :
says, "But I do know that nowhere
else did I ever see a fish come out

of a hole in the ground, skip blithely !
toward a tree, climb it, and then— i
wink at me. Nor did I ever in any 1
other part of the globe see any
other fish suffer from the heat to
such an extent that he would air
himself in a tree and then, after
climbing down, go to the edge of a
pool and douse his head with water."
If you like Ripley's "Believe It j
or Not" you will like this book, and i
you ought to anyway. —F.J.

THE GOLDEN VASE—By Ludwig
Lewissohn. Harper & Bros. New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book |
Store.)
A novel in thoughts. Being the
mental and emotional incidents in
Ihe life of an author of worth while
books that many read and few really
understand. Being a man of little ;
outward show and deep inner feel
ings, he has spent, fifty years among ;
people who indulge his whims as j
they would those of a child, and !
quietly ridicule him as lacking a |
sense of humor. Meanwhile, his is I
actually the right to laugh at them '
for their pettiness, but he remains i
silent and lives within himself.

Lewissohn's newest work is an
exquisite presentation of his philo
sophy of love, and of the extent pf
the rights of individuals to ignore
mundane laws and moral theories
to gain personal happiness. He tells
of an almost perfect woman, and
quite unintentionally inspires his j
readers to make a search similar to :
his. The one place the author at all j
seems to miss fire is in his blind shot |
at the futility of war —an arrow that j
is unheralded and unwarranted by
the gist of material in the book.
A short book as it is, it deserves |
a slow reading, and real concentra
tion for appreciation. —S.D.

U.S.C. may adopt a co-operative j
buying system similar to that used j
at Stanford.

a delightful series of notes covering j
sketchily the lifetime experiences of j

a man who has gone into most of |
the corners of the globe with an eye !
for the unusual.
Here is a fish story which is both
scientifically true and typical of the '
book. Speaking of Malaysia, Wells :
says, "But I do know that nowhere
else did I ever see a fish come out

of a hole in the ground, skip blithely !
toward a tree, climb it, and then— i
wink at me. Nor did I ever in any 1
other part of the globe see any
other fish suffer from the heat to
such an extent that he would air
himself in a tree and then, after
climbing down, go to the edge of a
pool and douse his head with water."
If you like Ripley's "Believe It j
or Not" you will like this book, and i
you ought to anyway. —F.J.

THE GOLDEN VASE—By Ludwig
Lewissohn. Harper & Bros. New
York. 1931. (At the Palo Alto Book |
Store.)
A novel in thoughts. Being the
mental and emotional incidents in
Ihe life of an author of worth while
books that many read and few really
understand. Being a man of little ;
outward show and deep inner feel
ings, he has spent, fifty years among ;
people who indulge his whims as j
they would those of a child, and !
quietly ridicule him as lacking a |
sense of humor. Meanwhile, his is I
actually the right to laugh at them '
for their pettiness, but he remains i
silent and lives within himself.

Lewissohn's newest work is an
exquisite presentation of his philo
sophy of love, and of the extent pf
the rights of individuals to ignore
mundane laws and moral theories
to gain personal happiness. He tells
of an almost perfect woman, and
quite unintentionally inspires his j
readers to make a search similar to :
his. The one place the author at all j
seems to miss fire is in his blind shot |
at the futility of war —an arrow that j
is unheralded and unwarranted by
the gist of material in the book.
A short book as it is, it deserves |
a slow reading, and real concentra
tion for appreciation. —S.D.

U.S.C. may adopt a co-operative j
buying system similar to that used j
at Stanford.
ADVENTURE!— By Carvcth Wells.

the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
For once a book by an explorer
minus the usual picture of the big- !
game-hunting author standing non- J
chalantly with one foot on the neck 1
of his kill. Carveth Wells has too j
good a sense of humor to do this, i
His humor and bis faculty of mak- j
ing the truth sound like a lie, color
a delightful series of notes covering j
sketchily the lifetime experiences of j

a man who has gone into most of |
the corners of the globe with an eye !
