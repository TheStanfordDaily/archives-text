''HELLO, girls and boys of radio
land. Tonight we are going to tell
you about another interesting game
for Inner winter

lor long winier
evenings.
"After you
have picked
your all-coast
team, your all-
American team
and your na
tional cham
pion, there is
still one home
football game
that will fur
nish you a
great deal of
good clean fun.
"The game is
"shuffle" and

the rules are
really quite simple. All you have to
do is to shuffle football coaches
around to other schools. It really
doesn't make much difference what
schools or coaches you use for your
game, but it mokes it more interest
ing if you take the big fellows. t

"Take Pop Warner, for in
stance. Pop lias been down at
Stanford for quite a while now,
and what with the lower divi
sion being restricted, and all, he
is particularly popular with
shuttle players,
"Now suppose you place Pop
at New York University. Then,
of course, you will have to do
something about 'Chick' Mee
han. He is the one, you will re
member, who became famous
for his endorsement of a light
cigarette of popular make.
"Let's put him down at Tu
lane. Then we can move Benny
Bierman, who has the Green
Wave well on t'ne way toward a
possible national championship,
up at Minnesota, - where Fritz
Crisler hasn't been winning
enough games to satisfy the
hungry alumni. Crisler can go—
hut you get the idea.
"Of course, we can start out some
place else. Suppose we put Pop
down at U.C.L.A., where football is
just coming into its own. You may
wonder what to do with Bill Spauld
ing, but that's one of the simplest
moves of the game—just make him
director of athletics at the same
school.
"Then, too, you can start in on
the assistant coaches, if you run out
of varsity material. Ernie Nevers
has been playing professional foot
ball for quite a while now, and we
can assume that he would not be
adverse to accepting a coaching job,
which wouldn't involve so much
wear and tear.
"Ernie is not only the star of the
Chicago Cardinals, but is coaching
the team with great success. What
more natural move than to place
him at his old alma mater, Stanford,
as an assistant coach? Of course,
Stanford couldn't have two backfield
coaches, so you can see the possi
bilities of the game.
"Oh, yes, we almost forgot. If
you remove Pop from Stanford,
you mustn't leave that position
unoccupied. Now with (he War
ner system firmly established at
Palo Alto, it is essential that
you pick a coach for the job
who uses that system.
"Giving a quick look around,
we notice Dick Ilanley having
iiuite a bit of success hack at
Northwestern. He uses Warner's
stuff, so he would be eligible.
And incidentally, Ilanley and /
Nevers would make a great
coaching team.
"Well, girls and boys, we no
tice our time is about up, so we
will have to leave it to you to
find somebody for Northwest
ern.
"Good night, girls and boys
of radio land." —L.M.C.

"Now suppose you place Pop
at New York University. Then,
of course, you will have to do
something about 'Chick' Mee
han. He is the one, you will re
member, who became famous
for his endorsement of a light
cigarette of popular make.
"Let's put him down at Tu
lane. Then we can move Benny
Bierman, who has the Green
Wave well on t'ne way toward a
possible national championship,
up at Minnesota, - where Fritz
Crisler hasn't been winning
enough games to satisfy the
hungry alumni. Crisler can go—
hut you get the idea.
"Of course, we can start out some
place else. Suppose we put Pop
down at U.C.L.A., where football is
just coming into its own. You may
wonder what to do with Bill Spauld
ing, but that's one of the simplest
moves of the game—just make him
director of athletics at the same
school.
"Then, too, you can start in on
the assistant coaches, if you run out
of varsity material. Ernie Nevers
has been playing professional foot
ball for quite a while now, and we
can assume that he would not be
adverse to accepting a coaching job,
which wouldn't involve so much
wear and tear.
"Ernie is not only the star of the
Chicago Cardinals, but is coaching
the team with great success. What
more natural move than to place
him at his old alma mater, Stanford,
as an assistant coach? Of course,
Stanford couldn't have two backfield
coaches, so you can see the possi
bilities of the game.
"Oh, yes, we almost forgot. If
you remove Pop from Stanford,
you mustn't leave that position
unoccupied. Now with (he War
ner system firmly established at
Palo Alto, it is essential that
you pick a coach for the job
who uses that system.
"Giving a quick look around,
we notice Dick Ilanley having
iiuite a bit of success hack at
Northwestern. He uses Warner's
stuff, so he would be eligible.
And incidentally, Ilanley and /
Nevers would make a great
coaching team.
"Well, girls and boys, we no
tice our time is about up, so we
will have to leave it to you to
find somebody for Northwest
ern.

"After you

your all-coast
team, your all-
American team

pion, there is
still one home
football game
that will fur
nish you a
great deal of
good clean fun.
"The game is
"shuffle" and

the rules are
really quite simple. All you have to
do is to shuffle football coaches
around to other schools. It really
doesn't make much difference what
schools or coaches you use for your
game, but it mokes it more interest
ing if you take the big fellows. t
