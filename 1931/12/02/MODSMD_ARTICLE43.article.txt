# Basketball Claims Returning Varsity Gridmen
## BIG RED MACHINE STARS TO BECOME CASABA TOSSERS Moffatt, Rintala, Baker And Doub Needed By Bunn For Team Nucleus 
### Dick Rodda 
When the Stanford football team
returns from Boston tomorrow, it
will be most heartily welcomed by
Head Basketball Coach John Bunn.
For Bunn has been struggling along
all quarter in fall basketball prac
tice without the services of some
of his best casaba tossers who have
been part of the Big Red football
machine.
After tomorrow, the basketball
squacl, now numbering about 40
men, will have added to it 'Phil
Moffatt, Rudy Rintala, Bill Doub,
Phil Baker, and several others. Mof
fatt, star forward, Doub, center, and
Baker and Rintala, guards, rre ex
pected to form the backbone of the
varsity quintet. No wonder Bunn
has been anxious for the football
season to close!
However, of the above-mentioned
quartet, it is not certain that Phil
(Moffatt will be as valuable to the
team as he was last year. Although
Phil played nearly half of the Dart
mouth game last Saturday, his knee
injury is such that he can run
straight easily, but the constant
shifting of direction demanded by
basketball is something else again.
Bunn has planned to build his of
fense around Moffatt and Tom
Cordry, diminutive but flashy for
ward.
As soon as the football men re
port to practice next week, Bunn
will begin to shape his squad for the
initial practice games during Christ
mas vacation. The complete basket
ball schedule will -be announced at
the end of this week.
Basketball practice for the last
eight weeks has consisted of daily
scrimmages and interclass competi
tion, as a result of which Bunn was
able to size up his new material.
