# CRIPPLED INDIAN SOCCER VARSITY FACES HILLTOPPERS SATURDAY IN FINAL GAME
## 
### 
Hard at work last night preparing !
for the season's final S.F.U. game |
Saturday, Coach George Eberhart's !
varsity soccer team faced the pos- !
sibility of starting the battle with
three regulars on the bench.

Mearns, outside right, appeared
on the field sporting a pair of
crutches which he has been ordered
to keep until the leg, which he in
jured in the last California game,
shows some signs of healing.

The defense bears the brunt of
the injury attack, however, with
Hayes suffering from "shin-spints,"
and Buster Holmes, star fullback,
exhibiting a leg which seems to get
worse steadily.
The Hilltoppers are a tough outfit

! to meet even with the entire Indian
' forces. But with three regulars
1 holding down the side-lines, the
i Cards* will have their hands full
when they tangle on the S.F.U. field.
Pending word from Coach Harry
Maloney, who went East with the
; football team, and who remained in
! New York for the meeting of the
I Olympic Games Executive Commit
tee, nothing is known definitely
about the chances for the proposed
trip to British Columbia during the
j Christmas holidays.

It would be a fitting tribute to
Stanford's first undefeated soccer
team, if the boys should get this
chance, but a great deal depends on
i the outcome of Saturday's contest.
