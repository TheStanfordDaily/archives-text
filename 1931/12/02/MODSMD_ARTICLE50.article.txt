# LARGE CROWD AT YEAR'S FIRST ALL UNIVERSITY BOXING
## Twelve Well-Fought Bouts Open Season; Myron Schall Referee 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Before a crowd of spectators Filling i
the Encina boxing room and ad- i
joining windows to capacity, Coach ;
Myron Schall opened the all-Uni- |
versity novice boxing tournament j
yesterday with the first twelve j
bouts of the year. All were well
fought, clean-cut events, the Stan
ford boxing mentor stated.
Two featherweight, three light
weight, four welterweight, and
three middleweight clashes were
held. All were refereed by Schall |
with Jacob Irwin and Myron j
Sprague in the capacity of judges, j
Each event consisted of three two- !
minute rounds. However, in several j
cases the referee was compelled to j
cull for an additional round in order |
to reach fair decisions.
The closest and most interesting j
bouts of the day, in the opinion of j
the officials, v/ere those in the wel- j
j terweight division.
In one of the best events of the
i day, veteran Jim Kelley barely se
[ cured the decision over Thornton
j Kinman, a plenty game newcomer
! in the art of pugilism. This was a
j welterweight bout. In the same
! grouping, Ira Jones showed just a
| shade better than his rival, Harry J
I Saxe, who put up an excellent ex-
I hibition for a beginner. Hall Martin
| took the decision from Gene Hallett
I j
j and Bob Quinn scored the only
j knockout of the day on Milton Lud
| wig in the first round.
