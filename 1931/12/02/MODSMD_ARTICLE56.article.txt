# DISEASED TREES IN ARBORETUM TO BE CUT BY ITINERANTS
## 
### 
Stanford's arboretum will be the
scene of tree felling and log cutting
Thursday, when about 25 itinerants
from the Palo Alto shelter start
work on ridding Stanford property
of diseased and dying trees. They
will work under the direction of
Captain J. W. Glover, director of the
shelter.

Most of the trees to be cut down
are Monterey cypress, dying from
the attack of beetle pests and lack
of water. In order that the beetles
on the dead trees will not spread to
living trees, University authorities
are requiring that all trees be felled,
their branches burned, and the
trunks removed from the arboretum
before nightfall. The trunks will be
taken to the shelter grounds and
cut up into stove wood.
