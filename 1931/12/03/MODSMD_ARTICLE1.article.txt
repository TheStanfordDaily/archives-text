# BRUIN CHARGES PROSELYTING OF PREP ATHLETES
## Daily Bruin Editor Asserts All Prep School Stars Are Approached LAVISH PARTIES USED Wellesley College Paper Also Hits Football 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2. (/P)—The
California Daily Bruin, official pub
lication of the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles, today says
editorially that "there is not a prep
school star of any importance in
the State of California who has not
already been approached by the
four Pacific Coast Conference uni
versities of the state."
Under the heading, "It Can't Last
Forever," the editorial says:
"It is common knowledge that all
Pacific Coast Conference teams are
proselyting athletes. Some do it
more than others, but all do it. The
only reason there is not more of it
at U.C.L.A. is because we can not
afford to do it.
"Individuals are not at fault. It is
rather the system which has placed
football in the ranks of big busi
ness. There is not a prep school of
any importance in the state at the
present time that has not already
been approached by the four Pacific
Coast Conference universities of the
state.
"Everything from lavish pax-ties
to bringing pressure to bear on
parents is used. Things are getting
into a pretty bad state when two
colleges on the coast deliberately
are taking care of football players,
so-called amateurs, and building
universities out of the gate receipts."
