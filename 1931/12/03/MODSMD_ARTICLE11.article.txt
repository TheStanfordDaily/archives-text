# ENTHUSIASM GREETS S. F. SYMPHONISTS
## Contrast Of Beethoven And Wagner Is Vivid Under Dobrowen Baton 
### Mary Louise James 
Playing before an enthusiastic
audience, the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, under the direc
tion of Issay Dobrowen, offered a
program of sharply contrasting num
bers last night, in the second of the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series productions
of the current season.
Wagner with brilliance, brasses
blaring; Wagner soft, spiritual, up
lifting, with soft strings and wood
winds; Beethoven with typical lilt,
measured phrasing, and gentle jo
viality.
Synchronization Effected
Early in the season, Dobrowen was
criticized sharply for the lack of
synchronization in the playing of his
stringed instruments; but that dif
ficulty has been almost, entirely
overcome, a definite distinction be
tween the violins being noticeable
only in the first movement of the
Beethoven Symphony No. 7.
In the overture to "The Flying
Dutchman," the opening number of
the program, the brasses are su
preme, the director giving a differ
ent interpretation to the woodwind
motif than that used by Hertz, slow
ing the tempo very markedly to
provide sharper contrast with the
rapid swirling movement of brass
and strings. A brief passage for the
harp is outstanding.
Interpretation Good
The "Good Friday Spell," from
"Parsifal," lovely in its delicate
shadings and subtlety of inter
woven melody, was beautifully ex
ecuted. Here again Dobrowen's
personal interpretation established
more definite and outstanding
themes than the "Good Friday Spell"
usually affords.
Most dramatic and moving of the
lot were the "Prelude" and "Love
Death" from "Tristan and Isolde"
in which the entire orchestra rises
to its fullest height of feeling. The
â€¢'climaxes in the operatic story are
strongly emphasized.
Dobrowen shows excellent skill in
the handling of his orchestra and in
his selection of worth-while music
that admits the entire group of in
struments and players to an equal
chance of brilliant technical and
emotional display.
