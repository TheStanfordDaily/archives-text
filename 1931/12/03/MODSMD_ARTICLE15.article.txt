# TICKET VIOLATIONS PUT TWO STUDENTS ON B.A.C. BLACKLIST
## 
### 
Two Stanford students were yes
terday given the minimum penalty
of blacklisting for one year as a
result of their transfer of Big Game
rooters' tickets. Charges against two
others were dropped when they
produced extenuating evidence.
The Board of Athletic Control
ticket department, under Jacob S.
Irwin, made the decision. This body
was recently given control over
such cases by Men's Council.
Yesterday's penalties follow by
only two weeks the conviction by
Men's Council of seven students for
transferring rooting section tickets
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia game. The ticket privileges
of all seven were suspended for one
year.
