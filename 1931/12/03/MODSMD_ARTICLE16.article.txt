# Repairs On Glass Dome Recall Campus History
## 
### MARY DELLA CALLAHAN 
For 33 years the great glass dome!
in the Administration Building has
withstood the ravages of time, and I
weather, not to mention an earth
quake thrown in for good measure. J
A week ago, a crew of workmen
began the job of strengthening and i
repairing the dome with its thou- '
sands of tiny, colored panes and
massive steel supports.
Until the new Library was opened
in 1919, the light filtered through
the facets of the dome upon the
books of students studying in what
was then the "Libe." In 1906 the '
earthquake demolished the partially !
completed structure standing in the !
area where the bonfire is built, j
which was to have been the new i
library. So for 22 years, the present |
"Ad" Building did library duty.
Meanwhile, the functions of Uni- !
versity administration were carried
on in the German building and the
business ofTice was in the present
Classical Literature buildings. When
Alnjon E. Roth became comptroller
in 1919, (he administration of the j

University was centralized in its I
present location.
The stained glass which is used
in the dome and in the windows is |
said to have been imported from |
Italy, which is also the source of j
the great windows and the precise i
mosaics in the Memorial Church. |
Legend has it that Mrs. Stanford 1
was unable to find artisans in j
America sufficiently skilled to lay |
the mosaics in the Church, and that j
these also were brought into this J
country from Italy to do the work
which has become a marvel to the !
thousands of visitors who view it j
each year.
The forge work required in the
installation of the new steel sup
ports was done at the Corporation
Yard under the supervision of Carl
F. Miller, foreman of the shop. In j
place of the old Hat iron strips, the j
new bracing consists of triply |
strong "T" supports. The glass has i
been taken out, cleaned, and re- I
placed in the new framework by a I
firm of glaziers from San Francisco,»
