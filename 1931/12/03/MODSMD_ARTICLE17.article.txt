# Congress Liquor Vote Looms As Drys Accept Bid
## "Let's Have It Out," Borah Reply To Wet Bloc 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dcc. 2 Con
gressional dry leaders today confi
dently accepted the challenge of the
bold band of wets for a showdown
on prohibition at this session.
"Let's have it out," said Senator
Borah of Idaho, champion of the
prohibition cause. As he spoke lead
ers of both parties in the Senate
and House expressed willingness to
thresh out the controversy. All em
phasized, however, the attention of
the new Congress would be directed
principally to economic problems.
Drys in Command
It was agreed that any roll call
would show the drys in command,
but all believed it would be bene
ficial to accede to modificationist
pleas that members of Congress be
put on record on the issue.
In just what form the challenge to
prohibition will be presented is un
certain. The anti-prohibitionists are
unorganized. Some of their leaders
are rallying behind a proposal for a
referendum on repeal.
It takes a two-thirds vote of Con
gress to submit a repeal amend
ment to state conventions, as pro
posed by Senator Bingham, Repub
lican, of Connecticut.
House Wets Gain
Representative Linthicum, Demo
crat, of Maryland, the leader of the
House wet bloc, today said there
were 150 votes for repeal in the
House. There never has been an
out-and-out roll call on this ques
tion, but this is the largest number
of votes ever claimed by the wets.
Senator Borah made it clear today
he was against the referendum
proposition. He said he would not
vote to repeal the eighteenth amend
ment.
"I must be satisfied of the wisdom
of a provision of the constitution,"
he said, "before I will vote to submit
it to the people."
