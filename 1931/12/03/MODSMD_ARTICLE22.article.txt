# RETURN MEET HELD AT CALIFORNIA ON ALIMONY SUBJECT
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Dcc. 2. â€” Stanford
women debaters held a return en- i
counter this evening in Eshleman j
Hall with California women on the ;
alimony question which was de
bated at Stanford on Monday night, j
Marian Harper, '33, and Alcie j
Small, '33, speakers for Stanford, j
took the negative on the topic, "Re- j
solved, that present-day alimony i
laws arc unfair to the men." In the |
first debate, Stanford upheld the af- j
firmative.
"Women are still dependent," said (
Miss Harper. "The alimony which
they receive is not enough to com- j
pensate them for the inferior posi- j
tion in which they are kept. Al- >
though the affirmative maintains j
that American women are the equals j
of the men, a glimpse of the truly i
equal status of men and women in j
Russia obviates a difference. In j
Russia there is no work which
women do not do just because they j
arc women and there is no dis- I
crimination between men and j
women in awarding political office, j
Consequently there is no differen- j
tiation of sex in rights and rcspon- 1
sibilities. In America exists a 'pa- j
tronizing equality.'"
The arguments of the California j
team were founded on the hypothc- j
sis that divorce laws are of nine- j
teenth century date while women 1
have achieved a twentieth century '
status.
