The actions of college students have always been a
puzzle to psychologists and to add to their worries comes
i report from the north that should give them a few grey
hairs.
Students at the University of Washington, apparently
wearied of the customary amusements of college life, have
taken up their old childhood games at fraternity and so
roritv parlies in an effort to appease their jaded appetites
for pleasure.
At one informal the whole evening was spent playing
Ring Around the Rosie. At another affair Farmer in the
Dell was the favorite. Those who are not playing join
hands and "skip happily up and down the room." Guessing
games are conducted for the benefit of the more sophisti
cated element.
Imagine a 200-pound tackle, his face wreathed in smiles,
dancing merrily around a circle daintily holding a lace
hankie in his ham-like hand. Perhaps the Was/iiiu/lon
Daily will run a front page picture of a brawny lad holding
a loving cup presented to him as the victor of the all-uni
versity "musical chairs."
Probably at the risque, unchaperoned parties Post Of
fice is indulged in or a game of Spin the Bottle will be
the wild climax of a roadliouse orgy.
Let all offer a prayer that Washington will not send a
picked team down here to challenge Stanford to a game of
( op and Bobber.
Come; in now, you little ruffians, it's time all kiddies
should be in sluniborland.
