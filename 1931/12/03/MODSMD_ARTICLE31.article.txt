# WHY STUDY?

In ;i contemporary college journal appears an adver
tisement of a coaching school which features the fact that
former readers and (caching fellows are available with
"likely final questions" to aid the students who are failing
or who need grade points.
All of which may he taken as just one more point in
evidence thai grade-hunters are with us in great numbers
with tactics that verge on dishonesty.
dramming just before ;m examination may or may not
be of any benefit to the student, depending a good deal
upon circumstances. Hut it seems a foregone conclusion
that an astounding number of students have lost sight of
the fact that the value of college training lies not in the
grades received, but in the knowledge, factual and cultural,
that may be acquired for use in life after college.
