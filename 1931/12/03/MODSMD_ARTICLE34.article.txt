FEMALE COLLEGIANS HATE LOW ON MARRIAGE MART

There were days when common |
talk held that a college education |
was the "open sesame" to every- j
thing—love, business, politics, and j
everything else. Then the statisti- |
cians got busy and have proven a
whole lot of things. The most recent
is that the percentage of college
girls that finally whisper "I do" in
a faltering voice is much less than
(hose who have not benefited from
four years in the hall? of learning. !
Of course, the possible truth of !
this finding cannot and docs not !
apply to Stanford.. Here, with odds
of six to one—the fair co-eds and I
also those that are not-so-fair have |
easy pickings; the Farm is clearly j
the happy hunting grounds—where
game does sport in great abundance.
Because the odds against the gradu
ates are pretty high on the average,
the "500" are apt to acquire a super- j
ior feeling with their high record
of easy conquests—but lei them not j
be misled; let them only remember '
their dating record back in the home j
town —where the battle was even :
and where the Devil probably didn't j
take the hindmost; but where lonely
nights before the family hearth did.
There are many reasons whj' col
lege girls might lag in the matri
monial race. Firstly, many men fol- j
low the Shavian mandate that wives j
should not be cerebrum mates for'
their husbands. It pleases the mas- :
culine ego (or at least some of!
them) to drop a few facts in con- j
vernation that transform the non- j
collegian individual into worshipful I
admiration; to fellow classmates,'

however, the remark is passed by
as a poor repetition of some re
mark that the professor has re
peated so many times as to impress
even those that were always in the
midway state between sleep and
full consciousness.
Then again, many college girls
think they want a career. To have
a career is a wonderful all-around
excuse for college maidens. If they
don't get a husband, they wanted a
career; if they get one, they have
sacrificed their career for their
married life (and sacrificing indi
viduals are wonderful people); if
they get one who turns out to be a
bore, the career is still open; and
lastly if they must leave him, the
career again jumps to the fore as
the best possible reason for such
action.
However, some college girls take
their careers too seriously; and ad
vance them from parlor-room
topics of conversation to realities.
A man dislikes marrying the
woman with a career. He is marry
ing a wife; and not a lawyer, or a
doctor, or the worst possible, "an
interior decorator." This reacts
against the poor girl; and she finds
herself stranded high and dry —
when they go marching by two by
two (the big pie-pan parade).
Then, again, it is very possible
that college girls don't marry be
cause they have had four years in
which to discover just what men
are. Maybe they know better. At
least that is the kindest way to look
at the whole affair.

vance them from parlor-room
topics of conversation to realities.
A man dislikes marrying the
woman with a career. He is marry
ing a wife; and not a lawyer, or a
doctor, or the worst possible, "an
interior decorator." This reacts
against the poor girl; and she finds
herself stranded high and dry —
when they go marching by two by
two (the big pie-pan parade).
Then, again, it is very possible
that college girls don't marry be
cause they have had four years in
which to discover just what men
are. Maybe they know better. At
least that is the kindest way to look
at the whole affair.

There were days when common |
talk held that a college education |
was the "open sesame" to every- j
thing—love, business, politics, and j
everything else. Then the statisti- |
cians got busy and have proven a
whole lot of things. The most recent
is that the percentage of college
girls that finally whisper "I do" in
a faltering voice is much less than
(hose who have not benefited from
four years in the hall? of learning. !
Of course, the possible truth of !
this finding cannot and docs not !
apply to Stanford.. Here, with odds
of six to one—the fair co-eds and I
also those that are not-so-fair have |
easy pickings; the Farm is clearly j
the happy hunting grounds—where
game does sport in great abundance.
Because the odds against the gradu
ates are pretty high on the average,
the "500" are apt to acquire a super- j
ior feeling with their high record
of easy conquests—but lei them not j
be misled; let them only remember '
their dating record back in the home j
town —where the battle was even :
and where the Devil probably didn't j
take the hindmost; but where lonely
nights before the family hearth did.
There are many reasons whj' col
lege girls might lag in the matri
monial race. Firstly, many men fol- j
low the Shavian mandate that wives j
should not be cerebrum mates for'
their husbands. It pleases the mas- :
culine ego (or at least some of!
them) to drop a few facts in con- j
vernation that transform the non- j
collegian individual into worshipful I
admiration; to fellow classmates,'

however, the remark is passed by
as a poor repetition of some re
mark that the professor has re
peated so many times as to impress
even those that were always in the
midway state between sleep and
full consciousness.
Then again, many college girls
think they want a career. To have
a career is a wonderful all-around
excuse for college maidens. If they
don't get a husband, they wanted a
career; if they get one, they have
sacrificed their career for their
married life (and sacrificing indi
viduals are wonderful people); if
they get one who turns out to be a
bore, the career is still open; and
lastly if they must leave him, the
career again jumps to the fore as
the best possible reason for such
action.
