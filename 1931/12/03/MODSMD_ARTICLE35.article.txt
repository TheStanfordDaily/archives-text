**THE SIN OF MADELON CLAU-

DE'!'—At the New Stanford.
Superb acting and excellent in
terpretation of a difficult role by
Helen Hayes is the crowning fea
ture of this play.
The plot is a new version of the
more-or-less time-worn idea of a
mother's sacrifice for her son.
Madelon Claudet, sent to prison
through a trick of fate, comcs out
to find that her son has shown
surgical talent. She hides her
identity from him, and sacrificing
herself, she becomes a woman of
the street in order to pay for his
medical education. The son never
learns of the sacrifice, however, and
the inevitable happy ending is ef
fected.
It has been many months since a
play with such excellent, artistic,
and talented acting has been shown
in Palo Alto. Given a rather poor
vehicle, Helen Hayes, through the
medium of unexcelled interpretat
ion alone, has made the "Sin of
Madelon Claudet" a vivid drama
from the pages of life. —J.H.G.,Jr.

**MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA

—By Eugene G. O'Neill. Horace
Liveright. New York. 1931. (Al
the Stanford Bookstore.)
O'Neill's latest play is impressive
and harrowing, even in the reading.
It is a drama of vengeance, of re
morse, and of unnatural loves, a
tragedy whose stark ending is in
evitable from the first.

Trio Mannons, a proud, aloof
aristocracy, have boarded them
| serves up in their temple of jeal
| ousies. Their lives, built on lies,
crumble, precipitating them to
j death or destruction, but only after
incredible, unendurable sufferings
have crushed the last of their hope
1 and made cynical diabolists of them
I all.
It is a tremendous piece of work,
comparable with the best of the
! moderns and—though prediction is,
at. best, guess—possibly one cf the
( immortals. It will, I do not doubt,
i live as a piece in the Theatre—as
will most of O'Neill's work—wheth
er clasped to the classical breast or
j not. Meanwhile it is enough to gasp
i at—and guess. —J.S.S.
