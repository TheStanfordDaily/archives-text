A better-than-average • football
| picture, dealing with the game from
the coach's viewpoint. The footbali
shots are a little jumbled, but they
are convincing, at least.
J. Farrell McDonald, who looks
! like Knute Rockne, acts something
like a coach does act, which is
! more than can be said for the
movies heretofore. Richard Arlen is
the hero—the young coach who
learns that winning is not every
thing, and Jack Oakie wise-cracks
' his way through five reels.
A number of S.C. grid stars ap
pear in the picture, but none of
them startle by their histrionic
I ability. —R.J F.
