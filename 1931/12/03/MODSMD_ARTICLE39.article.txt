# The 						Windjammer

### 
Windjammer is by nature an in-
I quisitive soul, always traipsing up
I and down back alleys peeking into
the inside of people's minds and
laundry porches. This time we pre
sent a tabulation of various satel
lites' thoughts and gentle prayers
before dropping off to sleep each
night:
11. E. Swain: Oil Lord—Bring
the Secretary home from Wash
ington. safely but soon.
Dean of Ladies (if any): Oh Lord,
keep the Phi Delts quiet for one
night at least; and may none of our
little half-thousand flock wander
from the fold before another day.
Pres. of Women's Council: Oh
Lord! That was SOME brawl! Won
der if there's • anything left in the
car ... .
Robert Brown: Oh Lord, one
sheep jumped over a while
fence. Two sheep jumped over
a white fence. Three sheep
jumped over a white fence.
Four sheep jumped—Oh Lord!
Quad Editor: Oh Lord, don't let
the battery go dead in my poor little
buggy before morning; let my staff
assistants treat me with respect for
just one day. Allah! Mot Nektia!
Amen!
Harry Hillman: Oil Lord—
preserve my cherubic com
plexion through another day of
admiring glances.
Gordon Davis: Oh Lord! Make
me merciful if I see those xp- :: '%s%

Vallejo Gantner: Oh Lord! How
will Helvenston ever get along after
I graduate?
Dr. Dyment: Oh Lord! A lit
tle sulphuric acid mixed with
the argyrol should knock that
Smith girl's—what's her name?
—cold . . . . i must try it on
the dog .... Maybe the pro
up at the links would like it
.... any Thursday from nine
to five .... Oh Lord ohlordoh

A Pi Phi: Oh Lord! Kill off all
the Kappas or bankrupt them or
something , . . . We have to get
that class!
A Kappa: Oh Lord! Kill off all
the Pi Phis or bankrupt them or

Herbert Hoover: Oh Lord,
how many tourists, all, all be
loved patriots of this magnifi
cent republic of ours—how
many tourists today asked
about my humble little home
on the hill?
A Phi Bete: Oh Lord, if x equals
Pi r squared one takes the exact
multiple of sixteen and applies
permanganate of potash treated
delicately with the Einstein theory
Flaubert undoubtedly was a fore
runner of the modern psychological
movement demonstrated in Bally
hoo no, I don't mean that ....
