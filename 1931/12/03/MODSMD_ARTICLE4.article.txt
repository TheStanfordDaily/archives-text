SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2.
—Indignant, Wilson Wallicr,
manager of a carpet process
concern at 3129 Geary street,
complained to police yesterday
that the bear went over the
mountain—or maybe across
the bay.
The bear, Wallier insists, did
not go of its own volition or
under its own power. It was
n't that kind of bear. It was a
wooden bear, Wallier patiently
explained—a bear carved out
of a single piece of redwood
at a cost of $250.
Although it weighed in ex
cess of 300 pounds, Wallicr as
serted, the bear went com
pletely away from its advertis
ing niche in front of. his plant.
He couldn't understand it. Po
lice expressed a belief that the
bear, being an animal held in
high regard as a symbol at a
certain East Bay center of
learning, may have gone in
for higher education.
