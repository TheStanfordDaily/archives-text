KING FOOTBALL will soon de- |
part from our midst, and basketball
season will be with us before we i
realize it. Only a half-dozen grid i
games of importance remain to be t
played.
While not winding up their foot- |
ball schedule until January first, |
U.S.C. will be one of the first of the j
coast institutions to open the hoop j
season. Coach Sam Barry and 101
players will leave this week-end for j
the Middle West to play a series of |
eight games during Christmas vaca- j
tion. The highlight of the tour will !
be the game with Northwestern, to j
be played at Evanston on December j
12.
Barry, planning to make another j
strong bid for the coast champion- j
ship this winter, intends to bring I
his team along slowly so as to have \
it at a peak when the conference
season opens, rather than attempt- j
ing to make a sensational showing i
on the tour.
CALIFORNIA again looms as
Ihc team to beat in the south
ern division, with only one im
portant cog missing from that
great Bear scoring machine of j
last year, Joe! Coffield, ali
coast guard.
Joe Kintana, forward, and
Jack Read, center, who between j
them scored 40 per cent of the
California quintet's points last j
year, are both returning. Read
was responsible for 12!) points
of the Bears' <i:> 2 last season,
while Kintana chalked up 128.
Meanwhile a pair of sopho
mores from last year's brilliant
freshman live promise to great
ly strengthen the varsity. Bill
Coughlan is being made over
from a center to fit into the j
running guard post of Coffield,
while Harold Eiffert, sensation- |
al forward, will probably be
paired with Kintana.
WASHINGTON, after winning j
the coast championship, again ap- j
pears the strongest contender in the j
northern division. While feeling the i
loss of Swanson at center and West !
at guard, the Husky squad will be |
sufficiently reinforced by men from i
last year's freshman and "super
varsity" teams to make a strong
bid to retain their present honors.
It Will be remembered that Cali
fornia, after cleaning up in this di
vision last year, went north highly
favored to down the Huskies, but
came out on the short end of the
series.

THE DEPRESSION is still
with us.
A mere $15,000 is all that is
being put up by the Agna Cali
entc <iolf Club to lure profes
sional divot diggers to their an
nua! open tournament, to be
held January 12, 13, 14, and 15.
In others years the stake has
been 825,000. â€” L.M.C.
