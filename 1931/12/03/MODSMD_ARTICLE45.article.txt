Six-Minute Matches
I Larry Hill and Clyde Gardner j
j meet in the major bout of the eve- :
I ning for the heavyweight, crown. I
! They are pretty evenly matched and ,
' should put, on a good show for the |
1 boys "out in front." As in the pre- j
! liminaries, each clash will consist i
jof three two-minute rounds with '
j 10-ounce gloves being used.
, The welterweight title will be the ;

j and Bob Quinn meet in the first
j bout of this rank and Howard Mar
i tin clashes with Jim Kelley in the
I next event.
Light-Heavyweights Good
Two contests are scheduled for

; Mendenhall meeting Louis Ruschin j
j in the first bout. Lewis Sterry, hav- i
| ing drawn a bye thus far, will ex- ,
j change greetings with the winner '
j later in the evening. The three men ;
l have shown well in previous train
j ing and should give good accounts j
j of themselves.
There is a lack of dope on the |
I middleweights, who did not put on !
I anything outstanding in Tuesday's !
eliminations. Ed Doleman is sched- '
uled to oppose Wilmer Blanchard!
and Bill Manger is matched with i
Walt Sjosten.
