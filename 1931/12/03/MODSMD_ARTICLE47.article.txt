Tomorrow is the last day fort
I
1 both individual and team en
! tries in the intramural track
I . i
j meet to he posted. Gene Mires
wishes it emphasized that fresh
men who wish to run for En- )
cina Hall must mention both
the floor and East or West end i
! of the hall on which their room
is located.
' When Stanford's runners, jump- j
i ers, and weight men indulge in j
| their weekly habit of defying time
| and gravity tomorrow afternoon, |
: they should produce «the best per- i
; formance in a track meet this fall, j
Nellie Grey came out last night j
■ for the first time and serenely j
: tossed the shot a mere 47 feet, ,
; which means that the hitherto un- j
! defeated John Lyman is going to
! have some competition on Friday
; afternoon. Bob Jones, who has been
! irregular in his participation in the
Friday meets, also has guaranteed
to make his appearance tomorrow,
i Two previously diasbled distance
i stars should also take part in the
i festivities. The highly rated Jim
j Ferrie and Stanford's own Bob At
kinson will probably run the half
j mile and mile races respectively,
j Sam Eastman, who wants to run a
| 440 and thus will undoubtedly run
| the mile, Frank Fullenwider, Bob
Burch, George Naylon. and Charlie
; deßietteville will try to show Fer
rie and Atkinson that the latter are

still invalids. There is also a chance
that one or more of the quartet of
two-milers—Art Azevedo, Dave
Devlin, Phil Morentin, and Paul
Abersold—may jog around the track
four instead of eight times.
The Hables brothers, who can be
found daily either in the hospital
or practicing on the old oval, may
be able to inveigle their doctors
into allowing them to run. Captain
Ike's fine intentions of winning the
440 tomorrow depend on his ability
to defeat such better-conditioned
performers as Handley and Guit
tard; and perhaps Les, if he runs,
will give Ben Eastman, and A1
Blackman some competition in the
sprints.
The weekly glorification of A1
Ray should again occur in the jave
lin, and the high jump without
changing its form is as usual a
toss-up.
Miller of Menlo and DeGroot and
Johns of Stanford may break the
season's record in the pole-vault,
although 13 feet 6 inches is a plenty
high goal. Jack Brugman will be
out to set a new mark in the highs,
and if he runs as well as he did
last week in the mud he should
topple his own personal record of
:15.5. Cotto Herbert will again be
running the lows as an undefeated
competitor, and Meier, Munro, and
Stallings will again try to reduce
Cotto to the ranks of ordinary mor
i tals.
