SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 2.—"As |
good as last year" is the best classi
fying phrase applicable to the Uni- j
versity of Washington basketball j
team which Coach Hec Edmundson j
will put on the floor to meet all |
comers in this year's campaign.
As Edmundson's creation of last I
season captured the Pacific Coast |
Conference title, .the above state- j
ment bodes ill for all Husky com- j
petitors. Although feeling the loss |
of Hank Swanson, high-scoring j
elongated all-Coast center, and i
Harold "Shorty" West, guard, Coach !
Edmundson has again fortified him- J
self with quite an array of talent, j
Tall Center
The pivot position will cause the I
Husky mentor the 'greatest amount i
of worry. At present he has only j
the lightweight Lloyd ''Pinky" I
| Nordstrom for that position, but j
| when the grid year closes, Pete!
Antoncich, Jimmy Phelan's end, j
will put on his scanties and try to j
fill that berth.
Antoncich, standing six foot five, j
! is a sharpshooter of the first water; i
j last year, while ineligible, he out- j
; scored Capt. Swanson. His brother !
! Mark, of the same height, and :
! heavy-set, will try out for a for- •
! ward berth and may show to ad- I
vantage.
Veterans Return
Returning from last year's first '
string are two more point-getters, i

i Hal Leo, two-year all-state prep '
j star, comes up from the babes, and
: "Hec" will have a tough time keep- ;
■ ing the tall boy out of a starting j
! post.
