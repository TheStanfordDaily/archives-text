# FICKERT DENIES CLEMENCY PLEA
## Walker Leaves For Home; Mooney Plea Done 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2 (A 3 ).—
Mayor "Jimmy" Walker of New
York left San Francisco last night,
the mission which took him on a
whirlwind trip across the continent
completed.
Whether the purpose of his visit
was successful will not be known
for at least three months—the length
of time which Governor James
Rolph's advisers believe will be nec
essary to make a complete study of
the case of Thomas J. Mooney, con
victed Preparedness Day bomber.
As his private car slid out of the
Third and Townsend street station
with the Southern Pacific "Lark"
last night, Mayor Walker left behind
him a raging controversy over the
circumstances surrounding the "par
don letter" signed by former Dis
trict Attorney Charles M. Fickert,
the Mooney prosecutor.
The letter apparently put Fickert
squarely on record in behalf of
Mooney, in the following language:
"In my opinion you are probably
right in maintaining that it would
be to the best interests of the state
that executive clemency be granted
to Mooney."
The letter was written Monday
night, in Walker's suite at the Hotel
St. Francis. Tuesday morning, al
most at the time the letter was being
read before the Governor, Fickcrt
declared that his statement could
not be construed to mean that he
personally was seeking clemency for
Mooney.
