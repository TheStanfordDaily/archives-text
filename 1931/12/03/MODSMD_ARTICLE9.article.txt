# PRESIDENT URGES HOME OWNERSHIP
## Easy Installment Plan For Building Needed 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (/P). â€”
I President Hoover tonight urged that
) some way be found for men to buy
| their homes on an easy installment
; plan free from "terms and risks
i comparable to the credit extended
; by a pawnbroker."
The chief exectutive asked . a
j search for such a means in welcom
: ing 1000 delegates to his conference
' on home building and home own
| ership.
No Solution Found
i Addressing the opening session,
| with Secretary Lamont beside him,
1 he asserted building and loan as
: sociations had so far found no solu
; tion. He suggested that installment
purchase be applied to homes upon
| the? same terms as fur coats and
, radios, with initial payments as low
ias 20 per cent. He linked home
J owning with good government.
"There is a wide distinction be
| tween homes and mere housing,"
I Mr. Hoover said. "Those immortal
I ballads, "Home, Sweet Home," "My
; Old Kentucky Home," and "The
1 Little Gray Home in the West,"
! were not written about tenements
! or apartment . . . they never sing
i songs about a pile of rent receipts."
Reports Already Made
The delegates from every part of
the country laid plans tonight to di
! vide tomorrow into the thirty-one
j committees in which they have
1 worked for a year. Committee re
| ports already have been prepared,
j including statements on home fi
nance and taxation, and if approved
| tomorrow will be made public.
