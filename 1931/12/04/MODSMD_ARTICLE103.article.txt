WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (/P). —
Readiness to vote on Prohibition is
coupled by Senator Norris with a
feeling that it's "a waste of time to
think this Congress is going to re
peal or modify" the law.
He expressed it that way today
as chairman of the Judiciary Com-
I mittee, which holds the key to Pro
hibition legislation in the Senate.
The Nebraskan said: "I want some
thing to take the place of the 18th
' Amendment before I will vote to
submit its repeal to the people. We
would just have chaos with repeal."
