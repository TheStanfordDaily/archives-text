# DESIGNER'S STUDY PROVES FEASIBILITY OF LARGE AIRSHIP
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dcc. 3 (/P). — The
Akron may be the world's largest
dirigible, but to its designer it's just
an aerial midget compared to the
size of an airship he has found can
be built with the utmost safety on
the same principle.
Dr. Karl Arnstein, vice-president
and chief engineer of the Goodyear
Zeppelin Corporation, under whose
direction the Akron was constructed,
revealed before he sailed for Ger
many today that his studies show a
ship three times as large could be
constructed without any sacrifice
of efficiency.
"With the development of a stand
ard type of large dirigible with a
capacity of 80 to 100 passengers we
should be able to operate a fleet of
these ships at ocean liner rates," he
said.
