SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3. (TP)â€”
Robert A. Carey, vice-president of
Marvelous Marin, Inc., and chair
man of that civic organization's ad
visory council, announced today all
Marin county had joined a move
ment to boycott the Southern Pa
, cific Company because of that cor
poral ion's opposition to the pro
jected Golden Gate bridge.
Carey said Marin county indi
, viduals and organizations had sent
telegrams to eastern manufacturers
and shippers urging them to avoid
use of Southern Pacific lines where
possible, and to travel agencies urg
| ing them to ignore the Southern
Pacific in routing westbound tour
ists.
"Marin county is not fighting the
Southern Pacific as much as it is
I defending itself from the railroad,"
, Carey asserted. "The Southern Pa
' cific started the fight by opposing
: the bridge, which would stimulate
development of the county, and by
J trying to increased commuta-
I tion fares from the Northwestern
j Pacific, which it owns."
