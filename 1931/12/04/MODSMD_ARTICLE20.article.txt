# Paly Police Force Takes Charge Of Encina Booty
## 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
Throwing themselves into the '
' ( spirit of the game with unequalled i
1 zeal two members of the Palo Alto
i Police Department's Expeditionary
; Force, in conjunction with officials
of the American Automobile Asso
ciation, played "Cop and Robber" J
with various rooms in Encina Hall i
i yesterday morning. A spacious J
truck was necessary to carry off
i the booty acquired in the foray.
Crestfallen frosh returning home
i to lunch registered complaints that j
the invaders didn't play the game;
| fair; they came with a pass key |
| and left the rooms bare. That is, [
the walls. And they were the pride j
j of Encina.
The prize of the invasion, a i
| framed Rules and Regulations re
, questing that "umbrellas, cameras, '
rubbers, etc., be left outside when !
| entering" and originally hailing !
| from the University of California
; library, merely topped an endless
si mini of "detours," "slow-men at !

work," and "roads closed."
According to B. A. Gage, Encina
custodian, the "Cops" played an ex
tremely lenient game in overlook
ing a $10 fine and legal prosecution
for ever stray sign encountered in
the frosh dorm. The game started
when several valuable stands were
reported "missing." Just how much
they were missed perhaps will never
be known.
It is thought that on behalf of
the "No Parking" warnings widely
distributed among various chairs
and davenports the local police
court's treasury missed most of the
benefit derived from their tempor
ary misplacement.
Judging from past figures and
computed statistics it will take ap
proximately two weeks, four days,
thirteen hours and five and one
half minutes to replenish the En
cina directory supply. This estimate
allows 7H hours time-out in which
to cram for "finals."
