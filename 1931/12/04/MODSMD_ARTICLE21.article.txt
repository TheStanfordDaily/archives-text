j SLENDER middleweight named Ed Doleman and a stock} 14!)-
! pounder yclept Fireman Jim Kelley furnished practically all the
thrills last night in the annual novice boxing tournament.

that Bill Manger couldn't keep out of his face. The latter, giving Doleman
inches in reach, tired in the third round, and Doleman nearly put him j
I away with a two-fisted head attack in the closing minutes.
Both Doleman and Manger won their semi-final bouts on technical '
knockouts, Doleman stopping Wilmer Blanchard in a round and Manger j
winning from Walt Sjosten in the second. Manger and Sjostcn were'

I the best scrap of the evening in the |

j The third was fairly even, with .
| Kelley's aggressive tactics earning <
| him the decision.
Kelley and Howard Martin put on '
I the best scrap of the evening in the |
| second welterweight semi-final, j
! Martin, a stiff right-hand hitter,;
! contented himself with counter
; punching, and once again Kelley's
i aggressive two-fisted attack gave ,
: him the edge. It was a fast battle, j
| Quinn earned his right to enter
j the finals by left-handing Ira Jones j
| to death. Jones, inches shorter than :
; his opponent, couldn't get under that !
; left to reach Quinn.
Heavyweights Slow
The heavyweight scrap was an ;
: uninteresting affair, Larry Hill win- !
| ning the decision over Clyde Gard- j
j ner after three dreary rounds. Hill j
j might have won by a knockout had j
] he elected to force the going.
Lewis Sterry and Louis Ruschkin
| staged the only overtime fray of the i
j evening, Ruschkin winning the 175-
i pound title after a fourth-round
j flurry. The thing was very close, i
| and many of the onlookers thought 1
i Stei'ry had a definite edge in the j
j extra canto.
Ruschkin outpointed Ernie Men- |
I denhall in the semi-final.
j Eddie Insley, a wild-swinging j
I youth, bailed Cecil Cutting in the i
! first round of the lightweight final, j
1 but Cutting solved his style there- j
j after and won off by himself by j
I jabbing Insley silly.
I Wild Swings
Insley and Grant Bartlett launched
{ at least a thousand hefty swings in J
| the semi-final, few if any finding j
i their mark. Bartlett was a pretty !
: limp kid after the battle, so Insley
| won the nod.
! Cutting outboxed Yell-leader Jer- ;
| ry Hampton in the other semi-final, i
i despite the vocal support lent
1 Hampton by the Dekes and the j
j Betas.
The featherweight crown went to
! John Huston, after a cautious three- ;
round setto with Bruce McCallum.
; Huston outscorcd McCallum at long
| range and tied him up in close, so
he had little difficulty earning the
I judges' approval.
McCallum Slugger
McCallum slugged it out with Bill
j Rowland for three rounds while
| Huston was outpunching Ben Hope?
;in the other semi-final. Hope hit.
! the canvas three limes during the
j battle, but kept boring in.
Clad in gaudy red and blue
| trunks, Harold Shankin copped the
| bantamweight crown by slopping
Wataru Sutow in two rounds. The
! Japanese youth was no match for his
j rangier opponent, who scored with
j lefts to the head practically at will.
! Referee Flanagan stopped it early in
| the second.
Announcer Gordon White was
j pretty formal about his announcing,
introducing each boxer as '"Mr. So
j and-So." Flanagan did a competent
■ job of refereeing, with Wells Good
enough and Mort Blackburn making
the decisions.
