# RALLY GREETS FIVE UDDERS
## Lack Of Enthusiasm Shown 
### Student Body 
Five members of the Stanford
football team were welcomed home
yesterday morning at a rally which
was singularly without any enthu
siasm at all.
About 1000 members of the stu
dent body stood around on the
steps at the entrance to the Quad
and waited for the parade of cars
which was to bring the team' from
Palo Alto. All the players but five
went home, however, and were wel
comed home by proxy. Paradoxi
cally, it was a rally without a team.
After A.S.S.U. President Bob
Brown welcomed the five, Comp
troller Almon E. Roth spoke briefly.
"Don't worry about Stanford's
football prospects," he said. "We
have plenty of material, and be
sides there were five junior college
transfers playing first string this
year.
"Don't believe the crape-hangers
who try to tell us Stanford is
through in football. Our teams have
a long l'ecord of excellence in all
sports, and we can continue."
Probably the high spot in the
whole proceeding' was the resem
blance of Phi! MofTatt, in his derby,
spats, and blue coat, to natty Jimmy
Walker, mayor of New York. Be
sides Moffatt, foeill, Corbus, Bates,
and "Dusty" Allen were the only
team members who attended their
own homecoming rally.
