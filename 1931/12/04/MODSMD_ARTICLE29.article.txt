# G.O.P. LEADERS YIELD TO FIAT FOR RUM VOTE
## Congressional Prohibition Ballot At Next Session Seems Assured DRYS EXPECT VICTORY Democratic Party Favors Liberal Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (A'). â€”
House Republicans yielded today to
the persistent clamor of the wet blue
for a change in rules of procedure
which will permit a vote on prohibi
tion at the coming session.
Meeting in party conference, they
agreed to support an amendment to
the rules under which any piece of
legislation can be brought to a roll
call if 145 members sign a petition
asking that this be done. Present
rules require 218 signers.
With Democratic leaders of the
House and chieftains of both parties
in the Senate agreeable, a vote on
the perennial prohibition issue seems
assured in both branches.
Dry Vote Forecast
The drys, confident of numerical
superiority, are ready for it. The
wets have no delusions of victory.
Their goal is to have the attitude of
all members of Congress definitely
on record before next year's general
elections.
The Independents long have
fretted under the present stringent
House rules. As they stand now, the
speaker, the majority floor leader,
and the chairman of the Rules Com
mittee have been able to say what
bills and resolutions would receive
action.
Democrats Talk Rules
While the Republicans were meet
ing today, Democratic House lead
ers got together to discuss the ques
tion of rule changes and agreed to
sponsor a rule even more liberal
than that of the Republicans. Rep
resentative Crisp of Georgia was
designated to present a program at
the party caucus Saturday. He fa
vors a minimum requirement of 100
signatures.
