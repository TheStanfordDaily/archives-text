Charging proselylini»' of athletes on a wholesale scale,
Cax. Clark, the good-looking blond youth who edits the
Ddilij liruin ;il 1.C.L.A., has exploded editorially about the
way prep school stars are rounded up and supported by
universi I ies.
"it is common knowledge that sill Pacific ('oast Confer
ence teams are proselyting athletes. . . . The only reason
(here is not more of it at I.C.L.A. is because we cannot
afford to do it."
So says ('.lark, and rightly, 100, but he offers no solution.
You can't prosecute a university because some zealous
alumnus works on a likely looking halfback, or because
a coach gives passes to entire high school teams i:i order
that they may see his squad in action. Tou can, of course,
lake steps to check the paying of athletes once they enter
college if you can prove that they arc paid. There hasn't
been a Pacific Coast Conference athlete disqualified on
that specific charge since the Johnstown flood, and unless
Czar Jonathan A. Butler is a one-man Scotland Yard, there
won't be any such disqualification for some time to come.
It may be thai ('.lark's real objection lies in the self
confessed fact that I.C.L.A. 'hasn't enough money to go
about proselyting in the same big way that other schools
can. Then again, his may be a heartfelt disgust with the
whole rotten system. If the latter, it is just too bad. Foot
ball is here to stay, and so is proselyting, its natural son.
