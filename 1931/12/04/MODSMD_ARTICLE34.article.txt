# HONOR AMONG STUDENTS
## 
### 
Our brothers at Ilic University of California are having
a Jittle trouble with their Honor Code, and certain revisions
recently enacted are expected to make its enforcement
more effective.
One of the new clauses provides for the stationing of a
reader outside the classroom, to whom students leaving the
examination room for a smoke may give their hooks, "leav
ing them free from prving eyes," as the Daily Calif omian
puts if.
If California authorities believe that students will peer
into bhiebooks not their own when other students are in
the room, does it believe that some of those "going out for
a smoke" will not peer iilo textbooks before they return
to the examination?
At Stanford, the Men's Coulncil is working earnestly to
instill the principles of the Honor Code into the freshman
class. As yet, no cheaters have been reported to the Council
ibis quarter. That may mean that the Council's teachings
are taking effect, or if may mean that Stanford students
are just as backward about turning policemen as they have
been in the past.
