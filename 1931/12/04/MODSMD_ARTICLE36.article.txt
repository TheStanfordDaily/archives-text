# THE
						BRONX CHEER FOR WALKER
## 
### 
Among other things, we wonder vvhal effect the Walker
ballyhoo will have upon the ultimate outcome of the Moo
nev case. Will an innocent man he restored his status as a
citizen, or will he he kept in prison? Will a guilty mur
derer he turned loose upon the public, or will he be kept
in prison?
The Daily is not in a position to know anything about
the guilt or innocence of Tom Moonev. I hat is a question
to be decided by (lovernoi Rolph or the Supreme Court.
However, the much publicized Walker intervention
seems to have but one purpose behind it. And that is to
emotionalize the people of California and their represenat
tives in ollicc with the objective of exerting influence on
the decision. If such be the case, then Mr. Walker would
have done much better to have staved right in his own
bailiwick.
