# BULL SESSION
## ALCOHOLISM AND 1932 
### 
It is an old saying—bantered about
for years —"Trust the Democrats—
that is, trust them to hash up their
victory chances." It seems that ev
ery time victory is within sane hop
ing distance, the sons of Jackson
break loose with something rare and
juicy that gives the Republicans the
presidency without even a close
fight. In fact, so prevalent is this
idea that now, even those that are
friends of the perpetual losers feel
certain that by the time the cam
paign rolls around, the Democrats
will do something that will ruin
their chances.
For once in recent times, the fair
sun of prosperity lias failed to tan
the broad back of a Republican ad
ministration; and as a result the
Democrats stand forth with a fair
chance to steal a victory in 1932.
Of course, despite the fact that one
legislature proposed abolishing the
law of supply and demand, neither
party can do much to relieve condi
tions. That doesn't matter, however,
when it comes to counting noses
after the election.
Now, it seems obvious tha't the
way for the Democrats to win is to
talk about depression; the Repub
licans rode high and fancy on the
crest of the wave of prosperity and
now the Bourbons should make
them guzzle salt water dowy in the
trough of depression after the wave
has busted. However, certain Demo -
crats who are financing the party
are determined to inject the liquor
issue into the campaign. The fact
is that the Republicans can ignore
the issue and thus keep their own

party solid, while a definite stand
upon Prohibition by the Democrats
will split the party wider than the
Pacific Ocean.
Raskob has finally decided to ask
the Convention to take a stand for
a Prohibition referendum rather j
than lor repeal of the Eighteenth
Amendment. Even this is poor tac
tics—if the purpose of campaigns is
to gain victory. Of course, a few
people still feel that campaigns
should be controversies over definite
issues; this group is small, very
small. Even Ihe demand for a Ref- I
erendum can do the Democrats no
good. The drys have nothing to gain
and everything to lose by such a
proposal; even the rabid wets should '
be against it, however. In a show
down, even now, the majority of the
people would probably still VOTE
dry—with some of the booze trusts
broken, the price of bootleg is being
forced down by the "little guys" >
through the medium of free compe- j
tition—and so with their tastes per
verted by years of illegal liquor, the
majority of Americans would in all ;
probability vote dry to '"prevent
drunkenness among the working j
masses."
If I were a wet, I would not de
mand a referendum now because I
would realize that all the people are i
not located in New York City; if 1
were a dry, I would sit tight and let
the wets worry; if I were a Repub
lican, I would encourage the Demo- |
crat#*) take a stand on liquor; if I '
were a Democrat I would ignore
prohibition and try to capitalize the
depression into votes.
