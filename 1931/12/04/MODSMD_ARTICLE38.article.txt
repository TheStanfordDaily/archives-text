FORTY STAY IN—By John Van
dercock. Harper's, 1931. (Stan
ford Bookstore, $2.50)
The author of "Black Majesty" has
painted here a vivid portrait of con
temporary life in Liberia. It is a
novel about v/hite men in a land
where the black man rules. The life
pictured is none too pleasant—and
for every man who escapes, "forty
stay in."
A young American artist comes to
the capital of Liberia. He is soon
in love with a young woman, but—
most dismaying of all situations—
doesn't realize it until the day she is
to wed another man.
Stripped to its essentials, the story
is the old one of two men and one
woman. However, the somewhat
different slant to the age-old situ
ation, together with the exotic buck
ground for the triangle, makes this
novel at least very readable if not
great.
Descriptive paragraphs are few
and well-written, particularly those
about the jungle and about Vai
town, the fantastic community
woman. —R.M.
NIGHTLIFE OF NEW YORK—By
Charles G. Shaw. John !>ny Co.
1931. ($2.50)
One of New York's cleverest
men-about-town has written here
an intimate guide to the Big City
after dark. Complete, pungent, very
readable (even if you are not liable
ever to get closer to New York than
Yosemite Valley), it is more than
worthy to sit on your bookshelf next
to "London with the Lid Lifted" and
"The Paris That's Not in the Guide
books."
Shaw is a frequent contributor to
Vanity Fair and The New Yorker;
his style is sometimes very literary
and then again frankly Winchellism.
In this well - organized, breezy
guide you may learn where to go,
what to wear, what to do after you
get there, and what to tip the hat-

I check girl.' Every kind of enter
| tainment is listed for every kind of
| fancy and pocket-book, from the
i Colony to Child's.

DUKE HERRING. By Maxwell Bo
denheim. Horace Livcright. (At
the Palo Alio Book Shop.)
This is a dreadful story about a
j person with repressions and com
: plexes. That even this prize circu
lation material can be tiresome is
j proved by it.
One interesting thing did occur to
' us while we were reading the book.
! Duke Herring writes about other
| men cynically but he never once
I thinks of his own short-comings.
: The futility of his existence seerr\s
! outside his comprehension. As he
! goes his own miserable way he
! spreads misery. It made us think of
| the job of being a critic and we felt
| most unpleasantly uncomfortable,
j We, therefore, twice bid you not to

FORTY STAY IN—By John Van
dercock. Harper's, 1931. (Stan
ford Bookstore, $2.50)
The author of "Black Majesty" has
painted here a vivid portrait of con
temporary life in Liberia. It is a
novel about v/hite men in a land
where the black man rules. The life
pictured is none too pleasant—and
for every man who escapes, "forty
stay in."
A young American artist comes to
the capital of Liberia. He is soon
in love with a young woman, but—
most dismaying of all situations—
doesn't realize it until the day she is
to wed another man.
Stripped to its essentials, the story
is the old one of two men and one
woman. However, the somewhat
different slant to the age-old situ
ation, together with the exotic buck
ground for the triangle, makes this
novel at least very readable if not
great.
Descriptive paragraphs are few
and well-written, particularly those
about the jungle and about Vai
town, the fantastic community
woman. —R.M.
NIGHTLIFE OF NEW YORK—By
Charles G. Shaw. John !>ny Co.
1931. ($2.50)
One of New York's cleverest
men-about-town has written here
an intimate guide to the Big City
after dark. Complete, pungent, very
readable (even if you are not liable
ever to get closer to New York than
Yosemite Valley), it is more than
worthy to sit on your bookshelf next
to "London with the Lid Lifted" and
"The Paris That's Not in the Guide
books."
Shaw is a frequent contributor to
Vanity Fair and The New Yorker;
his style is sometimes very literary
and then again frankly Winchellism.
In this well - organized, breezy
guide you may learn where to go,
what to wear, what to do after you
get there, and what to tip the hat-

I check girl.' Every kind of enter
| tainment is listed for every kind of
| fancy and pocket-book, from the
i Colony to Child's.
