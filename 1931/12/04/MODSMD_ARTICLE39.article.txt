Silas H. Strawn, president of the
United States Chamber of Com
merce, said today in a newspaper
interview that he has "definite hope"
for rehabilitation of the value of
silver, but none for international
monetization of the white metal.
"My opinion is that, it will be im
possible to get the countries of the
world off the gold standard to sil
ver," he said. Describing the silver
agitation in this country in 1893, he
said the policy set then "precluded
nny probability of remonetization of
silver."
Strawn is here for the Western
Division Conference of the United
States Chamber of Commerce, which
starts tomorrow.
