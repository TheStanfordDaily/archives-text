We have with us once more ye
stalwarte feetsballe team, glowing
with success in a little game last
week and particularly proud of the
ovation they got from a "bunch of
little gals in Boston"; bristling with
darbies and canes and spats.
Few major calamities are re
ported—only a few broken
hearts left behind them in the
frozen East—and a couple of big
railway companies in New York
and Boston that had to hold
trains for hours after schedule
time while miscellaneous ends
and tackles were rounded up
• out of by-ways, et al.
Evidently "once a Stanford man
always a farmer" is an appropriate
motto. Most of the Stanford yells
that we heard so gleefully over the
radio last Saturday were produced
by members of Harvard's Graduate
School of Business, most of 'em old
local buddies who've gone East to
find out who puts the "i" in bizz
ness.
Meanwhile, we'd been given
to understand that there would
he a welcoming rally yesterday
morning; but the team evident
ly preferred hot showers to
drizzling rain. And then of
course the Kally Committee
wasn't quite sure what it was
going to do about the rally,
anyway, and never did quite
make up its mind as to where
the rally should he held,
whether at the old bandstand
on Lagunita or the polo field,
with the other rabbits—so the
event will not go down in red
ink, in history.
Incidentally, a Certain Prominent
Student spoke in his own natural
voice, yesterday, for the first time
since thf? USC game. We should
have won that game, with such a
store of energy being used. That
sounds like just another fraternity
house story, but we'll swear by our
own sacred tonsils that it's true.
Another group of wise-heads,
seventeen, this time, have start
ed the semi-annual mental
campaign for Phi Bete keys
that would fasten in lapels, to
save the trouble of pushing
back the coat for vest-display,
every time they meet an im
pressionable person.
Dear old Daily pushed through
with another beautiful boner yes
terday morning, to the effect that
Walker was fighting to free Mooney
at the urgent request of "Mooney's
eight-year-old mother." Ye Gods,
my men, my men! San Francisco
and Mother India, all in the same
breath.

hearts left behind them in the
frozen East—and a couple of big
railway companies in New York
and Boston that had to hold
trains for hours after schedule
time while miscellaneous ends
and tackles were rounded up
• out of by-ways, et al.
Evidently "once a Stanford man
always a farmer" is an appropriate
motto. Most of the Stanford yells
that we heard so gleefully over the
radio last Saturday were produced
by members of Harvard's Graduate
School of Business, most of 'em old
local buddies who've gone East to
find out who puts the "i" in bizz
ness.
Meanwhile, we'd been given
to understand that there would
he a welcoming rally yesterday
morning; but the team evident
ly preferred hot showers to
drizzling rain. And then of
course the Kally Committee
wasn't quite sure what it was
going to do about the rally,
anyway, and never did quite
make up its mind as to where
the rally should he held,
whether at the old bandstand
on Lagunita or the polo field,
with the other rabbits—so the
event will not go down in red
ink, in history.
Incidentally, a Certain Prominent
Student spoke in his own natural
voice, yesterday, for the first time
since thf? USC game. We should
have won that game, with such a
store of energy being used. That
sounds like just another fraternity
house story, but we'll swear by our
own sacred tonsils that it's true.
Another group of wise-heads,
seventeen, this time, have start
ed the semi-annual mental
campaign for Phi Bete keys
that would fasten in lapels, to
save the trouble of pushing
back the coat for vest-display,
every time they meet an im
pressionable person.
Dear old Daily pushed through
with another beautiful boner yes
terday morning, to the effect that
Walker was fighting to free Mooney
at the urgent request of "Mooney's
eight-year-old mother." Ye Gods,
my men, my men! San Francisco
and Mother India, all in the same
breath.
We have with us once more ye
stalwarte feetsballe team, glowing
with success in a little game last
week and particularly proud of the
ovation they got from a "bunch of
little gals in Boston"; bristling with
darbies and canes and spats.
Few major calamities are re
ported—only a few broken
hearts left behind them in the
frozen East—and a couple of big
railway companies in New York
and Boston that had to hold
trains for hours after schedule
time while miscellaneous ends
and tackles were rounded up
