# LEAGUE FAILURE IN MANCHURIAN CRISIS PERILS ARMS MEET

### 
PARIS, Dec. 3. (/P)—News that
Britain, France, and Germany will
send their prime ministers- to the
Geneva Disarmament Conference
has provoked skeptical interest in
international quarters and has failed
to dispel widespread pessimism
about the success of the parley.
Some diplomatic observers fear
that prospects for limitation ox* in
duction in ai'maments are almost
doomed in advance because of the
disturbing situation in Manchuria
and because of the League of Na
tions' failure thus far to effect a
Pacific settlement between Japan
and China.
Whatever agreement may be
reached by the League Council on
the Fart Eastex-n quai'rel—and no
agreement appeared imminent to
nibht—the Japanese army almost
certainly will retnain in occupation
of Chinese territory, it is believed,
when the conference opens in Feb
ruary.
