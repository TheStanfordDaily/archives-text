Whether a book is in Icelandic, |
Malay, Mohawk, Chaldee, or Esper- j
anto, someone on the library staff I
can read it.
A recent survey of the GO em- !
ployees of the campus library re- j
veals the fact that 35 different lan- j
guages are known to some extent !
by at least one person on the staff;
26 either-with the facility of a na- |
tive or with ability acquired!
through formal education, and 10 1
with sufficient skill to master the I
general idea of reading matter.
According to the library authori- I
ties a knowledge of foreign lan- |
guages is one of the most important j
assets of a librarian, especially in j
a university library. There are a
large number of books received ,
which are written in languages j
other than English, and many of
those are on difficult subjects of a
technical, abstract, or scientific na
ture.
The most essential languages are
German and French, but all of the j
European tongues are valuable. The
less-known languages need only be
known by one member of the staff,
but the more common ones are
needed constantly.

knowledge of a native: German, 16; j
French, 20; Spanish, 3; Latin, 1; |
