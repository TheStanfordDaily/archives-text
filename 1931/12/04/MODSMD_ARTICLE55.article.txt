# FINLAND DRY LAW BRANDED FALURE; REFERENDUM SEEN
## Diet Asked To Authorize Vote On Liquor Act; Crime Is Factor 
### 
HELSINGFORS, Dec. 3 (^P).â€” I The
Finnish Government tonight asked
the Diet to authorize a referendum
to determine whether prohibition
shall be continued, repealed out
right, or modified to permit medium
strength wines and beer.
With the referendum measure the
government submitted a statement
declaring that during the 12 years
prohibition has been in effect none
of the expected changes in the na
tion's habits have occurred.
Contrarily, destructive influences
have been brought to bear against
respect for law in general, the gov
ernment statement asserted, because
violations of the. dry law have be
come so common.
In addition to the prevalence of
drunkenness, the government cited
a considerable increase in crimes of
violence and declared intoxicants
had played a large part in it.
