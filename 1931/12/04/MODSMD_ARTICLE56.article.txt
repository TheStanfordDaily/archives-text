# DISARMAMENT MEET MAY BE SUCCESSFUL

### 
PARIS, Dec. 3. (/P) â€”News that
Britain, France, and Germany will
send their Prime Ministers to the
Geneva disarmament, conference
has provoked skeptical interest in
international quarters and has
failed to dispel widespread pessi
mism about the success of the par
ley.
Some diplomatic observers fear
that prospects for limitation or re
duction in armaments are almost
doomed in advance because of the
disturbing situation in Manchuria
and because of the League of Na
tions' failure thus far to effect a
pacific settlement between Japan
and China.
