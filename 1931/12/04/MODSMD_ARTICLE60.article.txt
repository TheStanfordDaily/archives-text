# HURLEY HITS HUNGER TREK ON WASHINGTON
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3
retary Hurley today said a march to
Washington by groups of unem
ployed was '"subsidized." He added
that the purpose of the trek was
"nebulous."
The Secretary of War did not
elaborate his charges but said there
was incongruity in the fact that
members of the band had been hir
ing automobiles.
Hurley said there was no prospect
of troops being called out in con
nection wiih possible demonstra
tions after the group arrives.
