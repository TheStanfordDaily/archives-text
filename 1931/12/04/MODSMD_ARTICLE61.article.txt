# CHURCHILL ATTACKS BRITAIN'S INDIA FLAN
## 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 3 (/P>. â€” Winston
Churchill denounced the Govern
ment's Indian policy in the House
of Commons today as debate was
resumed on the report of the Round
Table Conference recently con
cluded.
"The policy in India has harmed
our reputation," he said; "because
the world has seen what appeared
to be a complete lack of backbone
in imperial affairs. People who do
not understand our ways, our re
sources or our power of recovery,
interpreted the negotiations with Mr.
Gandhi and the flowery speeches
about a United Slates of India as a
complete colapse of national and
imperial morale."
