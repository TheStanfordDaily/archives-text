# Indians Through As Grid War Continues
## S.M.U. Clashes With Gaels; Trojans Meet Washington; Cougars Threaten Tulane's Title Claim

Willi the return from the East of the football squad, mothballs yesterday
claimed Indian gridiron equipment, and tomorrow will find the Stanford
team inactive for the first Saturday since September 1').
Three important games will claim the attention of Stanford fans to
morrow, however, three games which may tend either to clear up the
"national championship'' situation or throw it into a still greater muddle.
St. Mary's, by defeating Southern Methodist at Kezar Stadium, could
definitely eliminate the Texas team from the picture, at the same time
establishing further proof of the quality of the grid pastime as it is played
<111 the Pacific Coast.

Southern Methodist has only a
scoreless tie with Texas Christian
to mar an undefeated record, and a
victory over the Gaels would give
(he Methodists a strong claim to the
"title" in case something happened
to Tulane or Southern California.
The game is expected to be one
of the most spectacular played on ,
the coast this year, with the in- j
vading Mustangs using wide-open
offensive tactics and a trick de- |
fense.
On the attack, the Mustangs em- j
ploy a multitude of unorthodox for- |
mations, featuring double wing
backs, split ends, back in motion,
and what not. On defense they
thinly nothing of using only four
men on the line of scrimmage, going
"Pop" Warner's tactics in the U.S.C.
game one better, but will use seven j
or eight on the line if conditions
seem to warrant.
So unusual does tomorrow's tilt
promise lo be that Warner is cut
ting short his Eastern visit in order
to attend.
Rambler Offense
Down at Los Angeles Howard
Jones will send his Trojans against
a Notre Dame offense for the sec
ond time in successive games, meet
ing Jimmy Phelan's Washington
team in the Olympic Stadium in the
final conference game of the season.
While Southern California is of
course highly favored to win, the
Huskies are entertaining hopes of
sneaking over an upset on the Tro
jans. Washington has had a rather
disastrous season, and a win tomor
row would be a grand finale to an
otherwise dismal performance.
The Huskies base their hopes on
the assumption that U.S.C. will be
resting on their laurels after ending t
Notre Dame's long winning streak
two weeks ago. Should Washington
manage to score an upset, Southern
California would of course lose any
chance at the national crown.
Title at Stake
An intersectional clash at New
Orleans also involves the mythical
title, with Tulane meeting Wash
ington State. Tulane, only unde
feated and untied major team in the
country, will have to stop the Cou
gars to insure an invitation tQ the
Hose Bowl game on New Year's
Day. Southern California already
holds a 38 to G victory over last
year's coast champions, and the ;
game should offer some compari- !
son of the strength of the Green 1
Wave and the Trojans.
Pacific Coast teams have always |
had a tough time with southern !
elevens, however, and the Cougars |
will have to go some to stop ihe j
New Orleans outfit.
