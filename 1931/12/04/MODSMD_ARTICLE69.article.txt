# PITUITARY GLAND IS SUBJECT OF MEDICAL LECTURE YESTERDAY
## 
### 
!
Speaking before more than 200 j
members of the School of Medicine j
t.nd their friends. Dr. Herbert Evans
of the University of California fac
ulty appeared yesterday afternoon
in the Little Theater and presented
a paper on the "Structure and Func
tions of the Pituitary Hypophysis."
The subject of Dr. Evans' speech
is a small gland at the base of the
brain that controls the growth of
the individual. Animals that have
had this gland removed have failed
to grow in a normal manner while
animals that have been subjected to |
injections of a fluid made of secre- j
tions from the gland have attained â– 
gigantic proportions. Evans, in* his |
California laboratory, has developed j
rats of nearly twice the size of nor- j
mal rodents.
One of Dr. Evans' most successful |
experiments was the raising of a 1
mammoth daschund that has skin !
that is unusually thick and a large j
head. This has been attempted by j
other research men but never per- j
fected.
