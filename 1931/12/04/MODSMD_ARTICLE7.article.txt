# 'DINK' REVIEWS 1931 FOOTBALL
## Illustrated Review Comes Out Tomorrow 
### 
I "Dink" Templeton's review of the
| 1931 football season, "The Time Had
i Come," is perhaps the most note
worthy article in the Christmas is
sue of the Stanford Illustrated Re-
I view, which will come off the press
| tomorrow. Dictated from the sick
, room, where he heard the Big Game
I over the radio, the Stanford coach
j voices obvious disappointment in the
, outcome of the season, placing a pre
| ponderance of the blame for lack of
I "fight spirit" on the indifference of
j the student body.
A report of, and incidentally a de
j fense of the Women's Triangular
Athletic Meet last month, by Ger-
I trude Hawley, acting director of
i Roble Gymnasium, is likewise one
j of the outstanding articles of the
I number. Among the stories by stu-
I dent staff members is Phil Hum
| phreys' "They Work for Peace," an
! article reviewing the diplomatic
I service of Stanford graduates.
Archie Rice, '95, is the author of
a report of the much publicized
i White House reunion of the 1894
; Stanford Varsity. The article by
] Stanley C. Herold, '09, on "Contri
, bution to Petroleum Literature,"
i completes the reportorial portion of
the issue.
The remainder of the magazine is
j filled with the usual campus re
views by Dave Lamson, '25, and
, Dolph Winebrenner, '32, editorial
! comment and short notices.
