# Soccer Squad To Play S.F.U.
## Varsity Trims Second Team In Last Practice 
### 
Holding their last practice before J
the final game of the season with
San Francisco University tomorrow,
the varsity soccer team last night
handed the second squad a 2-0 de- j
feat.
The first tally came when Falk ;
passed to Hearn, and the latter
pushed goalie Williams into the net
before he could get rid of the ball.
Number two followed Beggs' shot
at goal, when Knecht, outside-left, j
headed the ball out of Webster's j
hands. This youngster has been j
improving steadily all season, and j
another game tomorrow like the
classy performance he turned in
against the Bears two weeks ago
will make him a serious contender
for all-conference selection.
Coach Harry Maloney was on I
deck last night for the first time !
since he started the two round j
trips to the East- which he has made |
in less than a month.
Tomorrow's contest, slated to
start at 10:30 in the morning, will
be played either at Ewing Field or
the liilltoppers' home grounds, de
pending on the weather.
A victory tomorrow would give
the Indians a conference record of
seven wins, and only one ti.e This
would mean the first undefeated
varsity in the history of Stanford
soccer.
