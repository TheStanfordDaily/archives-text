"I HAVE NEVER SEEN Warner's |
system click more perfectly."
That is the way one of Pop's var- j
sity gridders described the Stanford-
Dartmouth game after returning to 1
the campus yesterday.
You will remember that Captain
Harry Hi 11 man said before the Big ]
Game that he had a hunch the team I
was due to click, and if it did, an
other game would be added to the
seven-year winning streak. It seems
his hunch was just a week early.
''If we had played that way against
California,'' our informant continued
yesterday, "it would have been just
too bad for the Bears. The score
would have been 50 to nothing!"
# »:« *
DON LIEBENDORFER, the
B.A.C.'s public relations coun
sel, puts it this way:
"Stanford would have won
every game on the schedule
this year if the boys had played
as they did against Dartmouth,
with the possible exception of
u.s.c.
"Even the Trojans very likely
would have been stopped by
the team last Saturday."

REMEMBER HOW Bill Mundy,
broadcasting the game on the N.B.C.
network, had Harry Hillman tossing
passes all over the field? Even press
reports had him on the propelling
end of several passes.
i It was all a result of the "magic"
i system. Those reverses, with Cap
' tain Harry handling the ball on
many plays, crossed up the experts
as well as the Dartmouth players.
It was brother Jack, or the left
i halfback who did all of the passing
I in the game, according to Lieben
| dorfer. The Stanford captain had
not been doing any pass tossing be
| fore the Dartmouth massacre, and
I Farm fans wondered what strange
new stunt Pop Warner was working
; to cross up the opposition.
>;t * $
STANFORD'S BLOCKING, it
seems, was one of the outstand
ing factors in winning the game.
After giving a good demonstra
tion of liow NOT to block in the
California fracas, the Red In
dians mowed down the green -
} clad warriors with machine-like
precision.
That first play of the game,
with Caddel scampering 72 yards
| to a touchdown, was the decid
ing factor. The play was a sini
| pic reverse, following a shift
from C to A formation. Perfect
i blocking took Caddel around

Dartmouth's right end and
sprung him into the open. Four
White Indians look after the
lone Redskin, but could not lay
a hand on the fleet Ernie.
After that Dartmouth never
had a chance.
i|! * *
THERE MAY have been no Stan
ford students at the game to tear
down the Dartmouth goal posts, but
down those posts came just the
same, thanks to Harvard.
The Harvard undergrads, who
formed the Stanford rooting section,
flowed onto the field after the final
gun and took care of that little
chore.
And it was their own stadium!

REMEMBER HOW Bill Mundy,
broadcasting the game on the N.B.C.
network, had Harry Hillman tossing
passes all over the field? Even press
reports had him on the propelling
end of several passes.
i It was all a result of the "magic"
i system. Those reverses, with Cap
' tain Harry handling the ball on
many plays, crossed up the experts
as well as the Dartmouth players.
It was brother Jack, or the left
i halfback who did all of the passing
I in the game, according to Lieben
| dorfer. The Stanford captain had
not been doing any pass tossing be
| fore the Dartmouth massacre, and
I Farm fans wondered what strange
new stunt Pop Warner was working
; to cross up the opposition.

STANFORD'S BLOCKING, it
seems, was one of the outstand
ing factors in winning the game.
After giving a good demonstra
tion of liow NOT to block in the
California fracas, the Red In
dians mowed down the green -
} clad warriors with machine-like
precision.
That first play of the game,
with Caddel scampering 72 yards
| to a touchdown, was the decid
ing factor. The play was a sini
| pic reverse, following a shift
from C to A formation. Perfect
i blocking took Caddel around

Dartmouth's right end and
sprung him into the open. Four
White Indians look after the
lone Redskin, but could not lay
a hand on the fleet Ernie.
After that Dartmouth never
had a chance.

THERE MAY have been no Stan
ford students at the game to tear
down the Dartmouth goal posts, but
down those posts came just the
same, thanks to Harvard.
The Harvard undergrads, who
formed the Stanford rooting section,
flowed onto the field after the final
gun and took care of that little
chore.
And it was their own stadium!

"I HAVE NEVER SEEN Warner's |
system click more perfectly."
That is the way one of Pop's var- j
sity gridders described the Stanford-
Dartmouth game after returning to 1
the campus yesterday.
You will remember that Captain
Harry Hi 11 man said before the Big ]
Game that he had a hunch the team I
was due to click, and if it did, an
other game would be added to the
seven-year winning streak. It seems
his hunch was just a week early.
''If we had played that way against
California,'' our informant continued
yesterday, "it would have been just
too bad for the Bears. The score
would have been 50 to nothing!"

DON LIEBENDORFER, the
B.A.C.'s public relations coun
sel, puts it this way:
"Stanford would have won
every game on the schedule
this year if the boys had played
as they did against Dartmouth,
with the possible exception of
u.s.c.
"Even the Trojans very likely
would have been stopped by
the team last Saturday."
