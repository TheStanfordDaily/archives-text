# SPORTS JARGON GOES CLASSICAL IN BOSTON RAGS
## 
### 
Boston sports writei's suf
fered badly from upset calcu
lations and eye-strain at the
Stanford-Dartmouth battle last
Saturday, judging by papers
brought back from the hub city
by the Cardinal squad yester
day.
"More like Gods of Olympus,
gamboling on a holiday, than
a football squad bent on win
ning an important intersection
al game," was the way tme
sheet described the Indians
from the West.
Commenting on the number
of blonds on the team, another
â€¢declared: "If the AU-Ameri
can was picked on good looks,
the entire Stanford team would
have to be included in the
roster."
The Bean-city scribes had
the Green Indians from Dart
mouth down to give the Red
Braves from Stanford a neat
scalping. But after the battle,
when the smoke had cleared
away and the yardage figures
glared up at them from the
piles of ruined predictions,
they put the Cards down as
inhabitants of Olympus, to
whom nothing is impossible.
