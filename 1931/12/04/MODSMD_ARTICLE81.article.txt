# Card Cagers Will Lose Phil Moffatt
## High-Scoring Forward to Graduate This Quarter; Leaving Nucleus of Five Veterans 
### 
Phil Moffatt has played his last game for Stanford.
Striking a severe blow to Stanford's basketball hopes, "Phancy Phil"
returned from the Dartmouth game yesterday to confirm reports that he
will be graduated at the end of Ibis quarter. Moffatt, who is eligible for
another season of basketball competition, was to be the main cog in the
varsity scoring power this year, according to the plans of Coach John Bunn.

> "I expected Moffatt to be one of
! the outstanding forwards on the
coast this year," said Bunn yester
day, expressing disappointment over
the loss.
Regular Forward
Moffatt played regular forward
! last season teamed with the diminu
tive Tom Cordry. Phil was the high
point man for the season.
With the loss of Moffatt, Coach
Bunn will have to begin reshaping
his squad as soon as the football
j men report to practice next week.
Toni Cordry, Bill Doub, Rudy Rin
; ta!a, Reggie Meade, and Phil Baker
; are expected to form the nucleus of
| the squad.
Added to these veterans are a
couple of promising sophomoi-es in
Keith Topping at forward and Dave
i Packard at center. There is also
some good material among junior
; college transfers. Jay Tod and A1
1 Norgard, both of football note, are
! reputed to be excellent casaba toss
| ers.
Should Be Smooth
With these men to choose from
Bunn will have no trouble in or-
I ganizing a strong quintet. The squad
i will obviously function much more
: smoothly in its early season contests
j than it did last year because of the
1 fact that Bunn has had a year's ex
perience with his men.
Stanford will open its basketball
season during the Christmas vaca
tion. The complete schedule will be
announced next week.
