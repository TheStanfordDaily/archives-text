# BABE TRACK STARS 'ON SPOT' IN MEET
## Ellington Faces Shortage Of Frosh Material 
### Dick Strouse 
"Where O where have my frosh
trackmen gone?" sadly trilled Bill
Ellington yesterday afternoon as he
looked in vain for certain prospec
tive members of the class of '35's
track squad.
it appears that the basketball
court and the glory of war in the
form of the R.O.T.C. have proved
more alluring to certain first-year
track possibilities than has the cin
der path, and Coach Ellington has
seriously considered attempting to
increase the attractiveness of the
sport of sprints and jogs, perhaps
by issuing peppermint pants similar
to those worn by the football play
ers.
Future Dyers?
Even the men who have signed up
for frosh track have been irregular
in their appearance; therefore this
afternoon's meet will be important
in helping to determine just what
these future Dyers and Rotherts can
do. One Lawrence Lapidus, for ex
ample, is reputed to be a proficient
broad-jumper, and similar rumors
have been circulated concerning the
ability of Lloyd Schween to hoist his
body over a bar some 6 feet in the
high hurdles, as to date no one has
appeared to cause Stanford track
fans to forget Packard and Meier of
the '34 outfit.
Ed Lettunich who, although in
experienced, is Ellington's secret
hope for the answer to his prayers
for a freshman wgeight thrower,
may also compete this afternoon.
Zucco, the tennis playing sprinter,
will probably run the 220, and
Deane, Boyd, and Vincent will as
usual put on a spirited quarter-mils
race of their own.
Kahn Turns Out
At least a partial solution of the
problem of where the freshman
middle distance runners are coming
from seems to have been reached,
as Marvie Kahn of football fame
came out yesterday and demanded a
track suit. Kahn is reported to be
able to run a half-mile in 2:02 sec
onds, which ability can be used this
year.
John Beatty will again try to show
that his high school record in the
javelin is but a hint of better things
to come at Stanford, and Russ Mun
ro will have similar aspirations in
the low hurdles.
Lombardi Favored
This afternoon's sprints will as
usual find Frank Loinbardi getting
the best starts of all the boys, but
not breaking the tape. Lombardi is
the meet's official starter, as his
weak leg prevents his running.
Ralph Giberson, whom an unkind
proofreader omitted from yesterday's
article, is the favorite in the 100.
Virg Dowell should again prove
to be a foot better than his nearest
competitor in the broad jump, which
is encouraging to Dowel! but not to
the Stanford fans who would like to
see a member of this year's team
out around 23 feet. Bill Werder's
recovery from his arm injury may
improve the quality of Stanford
broad-jumping.
