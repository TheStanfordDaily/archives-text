# ALPHA DELTA PHI WINS OVER A.K.L.'S 2 TO 0 IN OVERTIME TOUCH-GRID GAME
## 
### 
After skidding up and down a
wet field through two scoreless
periods, Alpha Delta Phi came back
in yesterday's intramural semi-final
to defeat Alpha Kappa Lambda 2-0
in the overtime.
A.K.L. threatened to score early
in the first period, when McCoy's
pass to Keipp carried them to the
Alpha Delts' 20-yard stripe.
The Alpha Delts opened up with
a fast passing attack near the end
of the second half, and short passes,
coupled with a lateral to- Naylon,
good for 40 yards, carried them to
the seven-yard marker, where they
lost the ball on downs as the game
ended.
Neither team gained consistently
in the overtime, but short passes
gave the Alpha Delts an eight-yard
margin at the final whistle.
