# COLLEGE GRIDIRON SHAKE-UP LOOMS
## Receipts, Faculty Control Given As Reason 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 2 (/P).â€”As the
1931 football season draws toward
a turbulent close, indications point
clearly to a number of new align
ments in college organizations as
well as some shakeups in the old.
Developments were hastened
somewhat by the effect of dwindling
gate receipts in the past two seasons.
The "big fellows" are getting to
gether more closely in scheduling
games with an eye to the turnstiles.
Another prime factor in the section
al regrouping, in prospect especially
in the East and South, is the faculty
desire to centralize and tighten con
trol of eligibility, subsidizing and
recruiting.
The proposal for an eastern "con
ference" or "association" among the
old established colleges, while not
new, has gained impetus unques
tionably this fall. Yale is under
stood to be favorably disposed and
Pennsylvania has gone so far as to
suggest a revival of the old Inter
collegiate Association, the early
members of which were Penn, Yale,
Harvard and Princeton.
The Pacific Coast is interested in
what may develop from the reputed
gumshoe investigation of Jonathan
A. Butler, who has made a special
survey of athletic conditions in the
coast conference and will report at
the mid-winter meeting. Butler's
activities, it is understood, were in
strumental in the barring of Joe Lil
lard, University of Oregon negro
halfback, for having played semi
pro baseball under an assumed
name.
