# CLASSY FIELD MAKES BID FOR NEW RECORDS IN INTRAMURAL TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Although few records are cndan
i gered, the competition in next Fri
i day's intramural track meet should
■be the keenest of recent years.
j When it is realized that such com- 1
petent tracksters as Les Ilables, j
; Fred Zombro, John Lyman, Bob
Atkinson, Bob Jones, Fred Zugar,
: and Frank Lombardi are the hold- |
; ers of the intramural marks, the
I difficulty of -setting manjl new iec- 1
ords can be realized.
All of the stars mentioned above
i are ineligible for competition this
; year, but the two men will be pres
■ ent to defend their marks. Bud
I Gordon ran : 15.7 and :25.6 last year ,

to set new records in both the high
and low hurdle races, and Tex Byrd
is the record-holder in the high
jump. Gordon will have his hands
full beating out Stallings, Herbert,
Munro, although Bud did get one
break when it was learned that
Wooly will not be allowed to run
this year. The intramural moguls at
the same time ruled that Jim Ferrie
and Stallings can compete, which
will make the competition all the
more intense.
The best chance to register a new
mark seems to belong to Phil Mor
cntin, who may be able to run
eight laps in less than Loofbarrow's
time of 10:21.
