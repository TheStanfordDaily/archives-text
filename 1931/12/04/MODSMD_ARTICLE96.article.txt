### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3.
, "Another step in the war on can
cel'," the development *of chemical
tests to detect presence of cancer
or cancerous conditions in early
j forms, was madd here today by Dr.
j Leonidas Charles A. HafTner, bio
chemist.
| The chemical tests designed to
i aid in the diagnosis of cancer to
j enable its detection in earlier stages
I than is frequently possible by phys
j ical examination, microscopic exam
j ination of tissues, X-ray or other
j observations, is declared to have
j been found accurate in 02 per cent
i of more than 1,500 cases.
