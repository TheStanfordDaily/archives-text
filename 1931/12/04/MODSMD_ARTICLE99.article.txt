# CHINESE DREADING POSSUM RESULTS OF RUSSIAN BOOKS
## Russian Purpose And Plan Appeal To Chinese Malcontents 
### 
Russian books are objects of i
great suspicion by the Chinese gov- ;
eminent, according to Professor Jo- I
seph P. Chamberlain of Columbia j
University, who stopped to lecture 1
at Stanford this week on his way j
back to New York from the recent |
conference of the Institute of Pa- j
cific Relations held in Shanghai.
When asked at a tea sponsored j
by the A.W.S. at the Women's !
Clubhouse whether he thought j
Communism appeals to the mal
contents among China's millions, \
Professor Chamberlain replied that •
many Chinese favored the Soviet .
form of government, resulting in j
strict measures by the Nationalist
government to keep the Bolshevistic J
ideas from becoming any more |
widely advertised.
Chinese Approve
The Chinese like the new Rus- j
sian government because it looks as |
if there is a plan and purpose be- j
hind it, said Professor Chamber
lain. Many discontented Celestials j
feel that nothing has been accom- !
plished in China since the revolu- |
tion of 1911.
"Many Japanese expect another ■
war with Russia, realizing that it
is the ambition of the latter coun- ;
try to get a warm-water port in j
the Pacific. They see that while j
Russia has a new government it has j
the same policy, a policy which
threatens the Japanese national
life.
No World Revolt
"Incidentally, Russia is no longer j
planning a world revolt. They aim, i
instead, to make their own experi- !
ment so successful that the other ;
countries will follow them of their;
own volition."
Professor Chamberlain said that
at the meetings of the Institute of |
Pacific Relations three languages |
are used—French, German, and j
English. At the more important
round-table discussions, a delegate
may pick up at his place any one
of three earphones, with the trans
lation of the speeches in three lan
guages coming only two or three
words after the speaker has said
them.
