MUKDEN, Manchuria, Dec. 6. (/P)
—A marked revival of the Japanese
Army's operations against Chinese
bandits in areas adjacent to the
South Manchuria railway zone was
observed today.
Reuters News Agency reported
that 300 Chinese were killed when
Japanese airplanes bombed bandits
at Kungtaipu, southwest of Muk
den, and at Tienpingtai, near Hsin
mintun. Another fray was reported
to have occured at Changtu, north
of Mukden.

The Japanese commander at
Yingkow reported to Mukden Chi
nese soldiers had been menacing his
command and the airplanes* had
been sent to protect him and his
two companies.
NEAR STRONGHOLD
Part of the Japanese battalion
stationed at Changtu Station, be
tween Kaiquan and Ssupingkai,
was said in a communique from
General Honjo's headquarters to
have been dispatched against a con
tration of guerillas in the neighbor
hood of the walled city of Changtu.
Japanese headquarters obviously
attached special importance to this
operation, which was said to have
resulted in disarming "considerable
numbers" of bandits, because the
scene is only thirty miles northeast
of Fakumen, reported to be the
stronghold of a force from the twen
tieth brigade of regular Chinese in
fantry.
A Japanese detachment at Hsin
mintun similarly was sent to sup
press bandits reported to be looting
Tsailipo, north of Hsinmintun. The
villagers were said to have taken
refuge in Hsinmintun until the
trouble was over.
JAPAN DEFIANT
TOKIO, Dec. 6. (TP) —A Sino-
Japanese clash on a much larger
scale than in the. past appeared in
evitable to informed circles today
unless Marshall Chang Hsueh-
Liang disregards the Chinese gov
ernment's rejection of the neu
tral zone proposal and withdraws
his troops from Manchuria.
The Japanese army is determined
that all semblance of Marshal
Chang's authority in the Chinchow
area must be eradicated and is sup
ported on this point by the civil
departments of the government.
Roper, Princeton coach, says that
no play is a good one which docs
not use every man on the team.

JAPAN DEFIANT
TOKIO, Dec. 6. (TP) —A Sino-
Japanese clash on a much larger
scale than in the. past appeared in
evitable to informed circles today
unless Marshall Chang Hsueh-
Liang disregards the Chinese gov
ernment's rejection of the neu
tral zone proposal and withdraws
his troops from Manchuria.
The Japanese army is determined
that all semblance of Marshal
Chang's authority in the Chinchow
area must be eradicated and is sup
ported on this point by the civil
departments of the government.
