# U.S.C. EMPLOYS MOVIE TACTICS PUNISHING 'SPI'
## Coach Jones Apologizes To Center Suspected Of Betraying Facts 
### 
In true movie style.
That was Southern California's
sensational 16 to 14 victory over
Notre Dame two v/eeks ago, a field
goal in the closing minute of play
snatching the game out of the fire.
Also in true movie style were the
actions of the Trojan coaching staff
in "imprisoning" an alleged "traitor"
of the squad in Los Angeles until
after the game so that he could not
betray team secrets to the tradi
tional rivals. They even searched
the "traitor's" house for the in
evitable incriminating papers.
Apology Requested
This startling disclosure was made
by the Los Angeles Evening Express
Saturday. The newspaper said that
William Hawkins, U.S.C. substitute
center, was taken into custody No
vember 16 by two private detectives
when his coaches believed that he
had betrayed details of his team's
play to Notre Dame. The charges,
the Express said, were without
foundation.
"An apology from President R. B.
von KleinSmid for actions of the
coaches toward Hawkins has been
requested by his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas P. Finn of Los An
geles," the story adds.
Students Aroused
"President von KleinSmid said
he had turned the matter over to
Dr. Willis O. Hunter, director of
athletics.
"So great has been the pressure
of angry students, alumni, and the
public who know of the case that
Head Coach Howard Jones has
made an apology to the accused
player before the entire football
team.
"Hawkins was asked to submit to
a complete investigation with no
alternative, his parents said. The
investigation consisted of a com
plete search of Hawkins' home for
'papers' and six days in voluntary
custody of two private detectives in
a cottage at Topango canyon."
In practice, November 12, Haw
kins was injured, suffering a slight
concussion of the brain. Despite
this he went out for practice No
vember 16 and asked several men
what their pass defense would be
against Notre Dame.
Information Wanted
This aroused the suspicions of the
coaches, according to the Express,
and he was ordered into training
quarters before Coach Jones, Direc
tor of Athletics Willis O. Hunter,
and Assistant Coaches Gordon
Campbell and Aubrey Devlne.
Hawkins claimed he was seeking
the information because he hopes to
become an assistant coach to pay
his medical tuition, and was thun
derstruck when the coaches de
manded that he submit to an in
vestigation or quit.
The parents said they laid the
matter before President von Klein-
Smid, and he was astonished at the
"tactics."
