# Three One-Act Plays Provide Entertainment
## Interpretations Of Dramas By O'Neill, Tchekov, Wilde Presented 
### 
Of the three one-act plays offered
last Friday evening by the classes
in production, Anton Tchekov's pa
thetic fragment, "The Swan Song,"
was most finished. Virtually a mono
logue, it gave Harry Hay an oppor
tunity to characterize an aged actor.
Hay's interpretation was good. It
had thoughtful nuances and was
real. Ho played a little high at first
but thereby only slightly marred a
really fine portrayal. Jim Sandoe
was the only other member of the
cast. Lynn Barnard's direction was
intelligent.
"Catesby," Perical Wilde's comedy,
was idiotic stuff from the first. Vir
ginia Wilson and John Henry Peck
ham could do nothing with it. John
Shidler directed. He might have
looked further for a play.
O'Neill's Play Hard
'"The Dreamy Kid," a one - act
drama by O'Neill, was probably the
most difficult of the evening. Dia
lect, a dangerous obstacle, was man
aged very well by the cast: Martha
Slayton, Jack Redhead, Josephine
Filcher, and Elizabeth Jenkins. The
play, one of O'Neill's lesser works,
might have been aided somewhat by
a tempo increase, but would be far
better if rewritten or relegated to
the oblivion which harbors "Thirst"
and other of O'Neill's early attempts.
Settings Rapped
The sets showed no great industry
or imagination. The Little Theatre
stage is poor, granted, but it could
be improved. The bedraggled green
curtain, while framing a history lec
ture very well, hardly do justiceâ€”
even to Perical Wilde.
The program as a whole far ex
celled the summer bill but revealed
nothing spectacular.
