# Phone System In Sequoia Is Too Rough For Roughs
## 
### 
Transformed from the orderly j
home of Stanford's ladylike co-eds J
into the den of outlawry that now
houses the uncouth rough, Sequoia
Hall stands today as one of the few i
remnants of an almost forgotten !
Stanford existence. Canoeing on |
Lagunita, the freshman-sophomore !
raid, romantic nights in the cactus j
garden, Pop Harris and his boot- j
black parlor—ail have gone the way j
of all flesh and of college traditions I
in our sophisticated modern life; j
but still Sequoia Hall continues!
proudly if tremblingly to uphold j
the honor of the life that has passed, j
Vociferous and multiform are the j
protests >f the inmates of Sequoia |
against their enforced place of habi- '
lation, and it is probable that the
loudest and most numerous of these !
voices are directed against the heir- j
loom of pre-Machine Age days: the ,
Sequoia telephone system.
He or she who would obtain tele
phonic contact with a member of j
that wildest of the tribes of Stan
ford Indians—the rough—must first
dial (he general campus exchange
6161. The University operator, if in
an obliging mood, then transfers the
call to Sequoia, and the hall's first- I
second- or third-floor phone starts '
to ring. No mellow-voiced operator '
stills the bell's clamor, however, as
telephone operators are scarcer than

] tuxedos in Sequoia. Rather, if a

condescending mood, he may rc
move the receiver from its hook and
I a bass voice will be heard to bellow
over the wire: "Who d'ya want?"

j the improvised operator yells that
j name in tones that carry over the
1 entire building. The recipient of the

I of the peace to go to hell; if the
