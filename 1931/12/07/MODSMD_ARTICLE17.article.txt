### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (/P).—Con
gross meets tomorrow to wrestle
with mighty issues in a session made
significant by business tribulation,
the approaching presidential election
and close political divisions.
President Hoover early today com
pleted his annual message charting
lor the Federal legislature a course
by which he hopes to quicken the
stride of returning prosperity.
No Coalition
Faced with a numerically strong
political hostility in both branches, j
the President determined to leave |
his recommendations in the hands 1
of the Republican minority in the I
House and the divided Republican
majority in the Senate. He will seek
no coalition.
About to take control of the House
for the first time in twelve years,
Democratic leaders continued their I
parleys with caution and harmony
their watchword. They are awaiting
the administration's program. They
will endorse what they like.
The President read over his mes
sage to the Republican leaders —
Senator Watson of Indiana and
Representative Snell of New York
—at a White House meeting lasting
until after last midnight. He then
sent it to the printers.
100 New Voices
Senator Watson described it as "a
forward looking, constructive docu
ment dealing principally with eco
nomics and finance."
More than 100 new voices will an
swer the opening roll calls at noon
tomorrow in the House and Senate.
There will be ninety-two new mem
bers in the House and seventeen in
, the Senate, the vast majority of
whom are Democrats.
The opening session will be brief
in the Senate, but the House will
undertake to organize. The veteran
"Jock" Garner of Texas is destined
to ascend the coveted speaker's
I throne with all 219 of the Democrats
reporting present tonight. The Re
publican candidate, Representative
Snell, will not have present all of
the 214 votes of his party.
