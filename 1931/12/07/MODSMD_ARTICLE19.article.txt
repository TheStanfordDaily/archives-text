## 
### 
Speaking on "Law in Relation to
I Business," Professor Harry .1. Rath
! bun last night told a group of about
) forty men in the Encina lobby that
| to prepare for business, they should
' take th?ir graduate work in the
I graduate school of business, rather
| than the law school. On the other
| hand Rathbun commended work in
1 both schools if possible, and said
i that any law student deciding to go
j into business should first practice
I law for experience. Above all, Rath
! bun stressed the importance of
i seeking advice from the deans of
j the business school and the law
j school, in regards to individual
i problems. These deans are well pre
! pared to discuss the stldents' needs
' and are glad to help.
i Rathbun has had training in three
j separate fields, all taken at Slati
i ford. First he graduated from the
| engineering department, then went
i into business, and finally came back
i for t'hc law school course, after
which he decided to teach law. He
i highly recommends public speaking
as being essential in any line of
work. â€ž
