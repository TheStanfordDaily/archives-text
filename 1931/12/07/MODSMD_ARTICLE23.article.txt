Silencing rumors that have been flying thick and fast f«»r the last week,
the veteran coach yesterday declared that he has every intention of
remaining at Stanford. He was emphatic in stating that he has made no
overtures to other schools, and that he is not "looking around" for another

Bierman at Tulane, the latter to go
to Minnesota.

tained as director of athletics at
Minnesota.
Warner denied that he had been
approached by N.Y.U., declaring
that all he knew about, the sup
posed offer was what he, "read in
the newspapers."
Watches S.M.U. Game

the East Saturday morning in time
to witness the St. Mary's-Southern
Methodist game in San Francisco.
Commenting on the Dartmouth

team played by far its best game
of the year.
"What puzzles me," he said, "is
why they didn't do it sooner. They
had it in them all the time, but
couldn't produce for some reason
or other."
