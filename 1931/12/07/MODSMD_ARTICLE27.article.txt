Changes in the A.W'.S. constitution are under consid
eration, and will probably come before the women for a
vote sometime next quarter. One of the things that is cer
tain to come 11 j) for discussion is a proposal to vest in the
Women's Council at least, for emergency, the legislative
power that the constitution now delegates to the Women's
Conference. *
In has been recorded that ihe Conference has approved
the action of the Council in barring women from the bon
fire. The Daily is not concerned with the specific case so
much as with the unconstitutional manner in which Coun
cil look matters into its own hands.
Just what kind of a clause is to be inserted is not known
now, but it will be something to allow the Council to go
ahead in its own way any time it cannot get Conference
together—in any emergency that arises.
'The Daily can do no more than point out the folly of
such a move. At virtually any time, Council can make a
perfunctory effort to assemble Conference, then go ahead
to railroad through anything it has a mind to, or has been
told to do. It is not the representative group that Confer
ence is. Its function is that of the executive, and the A.W.S.
would do well to limit it very carefully to such, or resign
entirely any pretensions to "student government."
