News items, given unusual play in the Sunday papers,
tell of the hiring of a private detective to preserve in secret
11)1* signals used by the football team of a certain university
on the Coast.
Can it be that football, widely publicized as a manly
sport, has degenerated into nothing more impressive than
racketeering? Why is it that a winning team becomes such
a valuable asset, unless the greed for financial gain be
comes the all-important factor? Jt is true that having a
winning team is something that every university and col
lege has fount! worth working for, but to carry the matter
to such extremes is a sign of weakness.
The individual apparently involved has cleared him
self, to the satisfaction of the coaches and team, of any
intent to sell out his team.
Nevertheless, that is beside the question. The crux of
the matter is that it should be thought necessary to put
any member of a football team under surveillance, such as
is employed to guard a felon.
If tins is a trend in modern football, can anyone foresee
the ends to which coaches and "interested alumni" w ill go
in their efforts to guarantee fat gate receipts by reason of
winning football? On the surface, it seems that football
for football's sake is no longer sufficient stimulus for main
taining the game; that the "game" must be played for
higher stakes.
Heaven forbid that this situation, with its attendant
odors, be a true, criterion. If so, that, coupled with the
already frequent rumors of professionalism, would sound
Ihe death-knell of intercollegiate football.
