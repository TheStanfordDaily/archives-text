Now and then someone emits a moan because Stanford
lias no such weattli of traditions ns surrounds some of the
older schools.
Stanford should he glad of the fact that the students are
not hound by moss-covered rules of an older generation
that have survived only because they were called tradi-
I ions.
Freedom is the keyword of the present generation and
traditions, when they act as restrictions, must be abolished.
Perhaps this desire for freedom may explain the lack of
encumbering customs on the Stanford campus.
A Rhodes scholar, not long out of England, tells of a
ruling at Oxford under which all students must be inside
the university gates by 12 o'clock midnight. There is no
reason for the restriction, he claims, except that it has
been preserved as a tradition from former times.
Stanford students should rejoice rather than bemoan
II io absence of such customs. Each generation, as it ap
pears, should formulate its own rules and practices and
not be governed by relics of a past period even though they
be disguised tinder the name of traditions.
