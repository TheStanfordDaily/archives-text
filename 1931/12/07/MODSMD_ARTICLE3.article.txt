# NEW PET OF HALL LEADS PAMPERED ROBLE EXISTENCE
## 
### 
When is a fly a flea, Oswol?
When it's short for fliegen
saycth Ozzy, and correctly, too.
You see, it's this wayâ€”Roble
crashed through at last with a
pet that beats anything put up
by the Row to date. Dogs, cats,
ducks, and gophers may well
weep in their oblivion hence
forth, for their number has
made them commonplace.
"Flea," short for fliegen, is a
beautiful bluebottle. He has
been sadly pampered of late.
In fact, he will eat nothing less
delicate than Roble cake, for
which he will come to be fed
by hand.
Come on, Row! What will it
.be next time? How about a
nice paramoecium, or a fancy
little amoeba? Or what have
you?
