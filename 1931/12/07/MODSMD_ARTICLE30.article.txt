# BULL SESSION
## IT'S TOUGH TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR STANFORD 
### 
The Stanford varsity returned
from Boston and received somewhat
of a decent sort of reception in
front of the "Memorial Arch" in
the form of a student rally; they
were also honored by a short edi
torial in the Daily and a glowing
account of their "massacre" of
Dartmouth appeared on the front
page. Honor where honor is due.
The Trojan varsity returned from
Chicago and Southern California—
both the school and the region—
seem to have done everything but
make a victory pyre out of the City
Hall in honor of the conquering grid
heroes, that is according to the
Daily Trojan. Following are some
of the heads that appeared in one
issue: "CITY JOINS S.C. IN RIOT
OUS WELCOME TO VICTORIOUS
GRID TEAM TODAY" (this a dou
ble eight-column streamer), "Un
precedented Ceremony Honors
Eleven with Cheering in Streets,"
"L.A. Bows Down Before Trojan
Warriors," "Wild Frenzy Witnesses
Victory," etc., etc.
As yet, no statues have been
erected in honor of the fighting
warriors of the gridiron, but may
we suggest that some place be dedi
cated for that purpose. Statues of
the whole team, each outlined in
red neon, should be placed in some
what of a public shrine—where
daily the student body can come
and offer up praise to the
"GREATS" that put 1931 in the
same class with 1492, 177(5, 1918, and
the rest. It might be found desirable

to have a band accompany these
rites with music of appropriate na
ture —of which the "Stars and
Stripes Forever," and "America the
Beautiful" must be included. In
fact, there are infinite possibilities
for this idea.
But on second consideration,
many people have statues erected in
their honor and then are forgotten
about fifteen minutes after the pub
lic unveiling. That should not hap
pen to these heroes that caused a
"wile 1 , frenzy," etc., etc. Streets
should be named after them; some
body overlooked that possibility.
Just imagine, "Shaver Drive,"
"Mohler Lane," etc., etc. But Presi
dents have streets named after
them as will these excellent foot
ball stars (if our plans is carried
out).
Perhaps, we can have certain
drug stores name sundaes and other
soda concoctions after these men;
but when they really will ARRIVE,
in the fullest sense of the words, is
when proud Los Angeles mothers
begin naming their babies after
these warriors. Then, only, can they
be sure of perpetual recognition.
Of course Dartmouth is not Notre
Dame and Stanford is not U.S.C.,
but even then .... And to the man
from the East who came to the
Farm and said, "Stanford over-em
phasizes football; worships its foot
ball men," we can only left face
H. Greeley and say, "Go South,
young man, Go South."

pen to these heroes that caused a
"wile 1 , frenzy," etc., etc. Streets
should be named after them; some
body overlooked that possibility.
Just imagine, "Shaver Drive,"
"Mohler Lane," etc., etc. But Presi
dents have streets named after
them as will these excellent foot
ball stars (if our plans is carried
out).
Perhaps, we can have certain
drug stores name sundaes and other
soda concoctions after these men;
but when they really will ARRIVE,
in the fullest sense of the words, is
when proud Los Angeles mothers
begin naming their babies after
these warriors. Then, only, can they
be sure of perpetual recognition.
Of course Dartmouth is not Notre
Dame and Stanford is not U.S.C.,
but even then .... And to the man
from the East who came to the
Farm and said, "Stanford over-em
phasizes football; worships its foot
ball men," we can only left face
H. Greeley and say, "Go South,
young man, Go South."

The Stanford varsity returned
from Boston and received somewhat
of a decent sort of reception in
front of the "Memorial Arch" in
the form of a student rally; they
were also honored by a short edi
torial in the Daily and a glowing
account of their "massacre" of
Dartmouth appeared on the front
page. Honor where honor is due.
The Trojan varsity returned from
Chicago and Southern California—
both the school and the region—
seem to have done everything but
make a victory pyre out of the City
Hall in honor of the conquering grid
heroes, that is according to the
Daily Trojan. Following are some
of the heads that appeared in one
issue: "CITY JOINS S.C. IN RIOT
OUS WELCOME TO VICTORIOUS
GRID TEAM TODAY" (this a dou
ble eight-column streamer), "Un
precedented Ceremony Honors
Eleven with Cheering in Streets,"
"L.A. Bows Down Before Trojan
Warriors," "Wild Frenzy Witnesses
Victory," etc., etc.
As yet, no statues have been
erected in honor of the fighting
warriors of the gridiron, but may
we suggest that some place be dedi
cated for that purpose. Statues of
the whole team, each outlined in
red neon, should be placed in some
what of a public shrine—where
daily the student body can come
and offer up praise to the
"GREATS" that put 1931 in the
same class with 1492, 177(5, 1918, and
the rest. It might be found desirable

to have a band accompany these
rites with music of appropriate na
ture —of which the "Stars and
Stripes Forever," and "America the
Beautiful" must be included. In
fact, there are infinite possibilities
for this idea.
But on second consideration,
many people have statues erected in
their honor and then are forgotten
about fifteen minutes after the pub
lic unveiling. That should not hap
pen to these heroes that caused a
"wile 1 , frenzy," etc., etc. Streets
should be named after them; some
body overlooked that possibility.
