THE VANITY FAIR BOOK—John
Day Co. 1931.
This is a collection of the high
| spots from America's smartest
i magazine. All the favorites from
Vanity Fair's pages are represented
in this sizeable volume. None of the
I material is new; it is simply an ex
cellent reprinting of the best arti
cles, short stories, character studies,
! and humorous bits, as well as the
best of those marvelous photographs
| and devastating cartoons.
Clare Boothe Brokaw, associate
j editor of Vanity Fair, figures promi
j nently with a number of her first
i class short stories. The photographs
I —easily the most interesting pub
lished in any American magazine—
| are alone worth the price of the
! book.
| It's a nice thing to have around
1 for a few moments' reading at odd
j times, or to - entertain unexpected
visitors. —R.M.
EDDIE CANTOR IN PALMY DAYS
j with Charlotte Greenwood at the
Stanford Theatre.
j Even if talkies ala musical com-
I edy are out of style this fellow
i Eddie Cantor never is. Pursued for
| six or seven reels by the elongated
| Charlotte Greenwood, banjo-eyed
| Eddie manages to inject some of
I his own very special personality,
J map, song, and spice before suc
; cumbing to persistent feminine
i wiles.
The supporting cast as in all

musical comedies, executes intricate
steps in line time, just to show that
working in a doughnut factory
makes one feel that way. Everything
i has been planned on the Ziegfeld
I pattern—even a trite and inane plot
! There are pretty girls, scantily clad,
j snappy skits, funnily told, and
I songs, sweetly and otherwise sung,
j Also a love story with the hero
I making up and a counter story of
' fake fortune tellers in high places.
' But Eddie keeps them all together.
Good entertainment if nothing
j else. —W.R.
THE UNIIOLY GARDEN—At tlie
Varsity Theatre.
j Without doubt this is the best
; picture to come to the Varsity this
j fall quarter. The debonair Ronald
! Colman is responsible for its being
j good since minus suave Mr. Beau
I Geste the picture would have fallen
j into gross sentimentality. We think
I after this ,his latest success, that
] Colrnan is one of Ihe most-poised
j actors on the screen today. The
way he manages to be the very most
awfully wicked man of the lot
while you know all the time that
he is a swell guy is pretty fine.

! Schedule for Final Week: "Around
1 the World in 80 Minutes," with
| Douglas Fairbanks, and "Over the
! Hill," with James Dunn and Sally
! Eilers. We hear that they are both
, good and in a light vein .... quite
I suitable. —E.T.P.
