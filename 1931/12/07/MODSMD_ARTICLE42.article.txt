# Al Ray Shines In Encouraging Practice Track Meet
## IMPROVEMENT OF AMDAHL, BUTLER CHEERS COACHES Gray Throws Shot 48 Feet In Year's First Trial; Ike Hables Good 
### Dick Strouse 
TJndor the double influence of j
George f3. Culver's presence and Al i
Ray's example, Stanford's track men j
presented the best of the early sea- I
son practice meets last Friday af- ;
ternoon. The appearance of Dean !
Culver and of his assistant, Dave
Jacobson, was probably due purely
to a desire to see the boys in ac
tion; nevertheless, it served to spur
the contestants on to their noblest
attempts and it kept the meet clean
and free from such ungentlemanly
practices as kicking mud in other
runners' faces and filling an op
ponent's vaulting pole with lead.
Of more practical if less moral j
value of the welfare of the track
team was Ray's mark of 195 feet 10
inches in the javelin. Al threw the
spear over 190 feet on every at
tempt last Friday, and his consis
tent improvement is better news to :
Stanford than it is to U.S.C. The j
pole-vault again found Ned Johns j
and Bert DeGroot lieing at .12 feet j
6 inches.
Amdahl Good
Amdahl, who won the two-mile (
in the Lit tie Big Meet last year,
suddenly got into shape-*and ran
the legs oil' Azevedo and Morentin
lo win his specialty in 10:25.2. Al
lium# h Azevedo was in no condi
tion lo compete, he ran gamely to |
place second, but it was Amdahl's j
apparent return to form that most !
pleased Bill Ellington.
The broad-jumpers also uncx- ;
pectedly removed their carcasses J
from the well-known dime, and
Wally Butler threw his body 22 feet
inches through the air. Phil
Williams showed encouraging im
provement when he broke his ov/n 1
record in this event by jumping 21
feet 7',2 inches, although both But
ler and Williams were beaten by
graduate Virg Dowell. The high
jump was also captured by a for
mer star, Arnie West winning at 5
feet 0 inches.
Gihcrson Wins Again
Although recording his usual vie- i
lory in the 100 in his usual time of. |
10.1 second.-:, Ralph Giberson looked
better Friday than he has at any
other time this year. Gibey's "gath
er," on which he has been working,
gave him a finish strong enough to.
prevent Ben Eastman from engag
ing in his customary pastime of
picking up yardage toward the end i
of the race. Big Ben showed that I
lie himself had not slowed up when j
}»e stepped off a speedy 229 in :21.7. I
Frank Fullenwider and Will Har- j
wood were the winners in the
auxiliary heats of the 100 and 220,
respectively.
Captain Ike Hables, although sup
posedly in no shape to run, showed i
his old-time speed when winning
the 440 from Dan Murphy, also a
recent invalid, in :51.9. Ward Vin- j
cent nosed out Bob Boyd in the
.second heat of the 440 in :55.5 to
show that the frosh may have some
quarter-milers after all.
Milcrs Determined
Bill Ellington called off the mile
when the first half-mile was run in
only 2:23, but Bob Atkinson and
Dick Wright were so determined to
finish their mile that they entered
the regular 880 and placed one-two
in the two-lap race. Atkinson's time
of 2:03.1. is also very promising, as
the bonfire and injuries have kept j
Bob from regular workouts this
year. Fullenwider's victory in the j
100 so stunned him that he could j
get no better than third in the 880. j
No novelty was introduced into j
(lie hurdle races, as Jack Brugman !
and Cotton Herbert again won the j
highs and lows respectively. Bud
Gordon created a minor upset when j
he beat Dean Stallings out of a |
second place in the highs, and
Brugman did the same thing to
Gordon in the lows. Munro beat

Cotton and Bright in the freshman
low hurdles.
John Lyman's search for a man
to beat him in the shot-put finally
culminated successfully, and Nellie
Gray obligingly heaved the pill 47
feet1110 1 •» inches for a first place.
Gray also won the discus with
Lyman again finishing second, prin
cipally because Bob Jones chose not
to compete.
