In losing a heartbreaking game
to St. Mary's Saturday, the Mus
j tangs of Southern Methodist elimi
| nated themselves from what might
; have become a very good claim to
! the national "championship."
As it is, a place for the trophy
is being dusted off at the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce,
and it will be surprising indeed
if anything happens to prevent
its reposing there for the next
year.
Two powerful Southern teams
j still bar the way between U.S.C. and
j the title, but with the Trojans con-
J tinuing their ti'iumphal march by
crushing Washington, 44 to 7, there
| is little indication that either
! Georgia or Tulane will be able to
stop them.

seventeen games played already this
