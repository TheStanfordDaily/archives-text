# POLO TEAM LOSES TO MENLO CLUB, 8-7
## 
### 
Lacking the necessary scoring
punch, Stanford's polo team went
down to defeat last Friday, 8-7, in
a match with the Menlo Circus
Club.
The Redshirt riders held the
Menlo outfit in the opening chuk
kers, but the final periods saw the
Cardinals weaken and let the Club
run up most of their tallies. In
ferior ponies had considerable to do
with the defeat.
Fleming and Lewis were out
standing for Stanford, while Tevis,
stellar six-goal man, was Menlo's
big threat.
