# INDIAN SOCCERMEN COMPLETE SEASON WITH 1-1 S.F.U. TIE
## 
### 
Battling to defend their slender
j one-goal lead, gained near the end
i of the first half, Stanford's varsity
: soccer team saw its chances for
! seven straight conference victories
! vanish Saturday when San Fran
! Cisco University kickers evened the
| count early' in the second period
; and then held the Indians away
\ from their goal until the final
whistle.
I Stanford's score was the result of
' Fi-.lk'd neat follow-up shot, after
j Johnnie Moore's penalty kick near
j the Hilltoppers' net had been
I blocked. Up to this point the Indians
' bad had by far the best of the
| going.
Coming back with a rush in the
second half, the S.F.U. men en
gineered four determined drives at
the Stanford net, the last of which
i resulted in the tying marker.
The Indians played the entire
j game without the services of Bill
! Mearns, all-conference outside right,
] who is laid up with a thoroughly
i wrecked leg from the last battle
j with California.
