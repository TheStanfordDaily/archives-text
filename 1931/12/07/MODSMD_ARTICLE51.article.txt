# STRONG DEFENSE OF ST. MARY'S TOO MUCH FOR MUSTANGS' PASSING ATTACK
## 
### Albert Guerard 
! Bewildered throughout the first
| half by a well-nigh perfect passing
: attack, St. Mary's came back in the
I last two periods to upset the previ
! ously undefeated Mustangs of
j Southern Methodist, 7-2, Saturday
I in San Francisco, in the most spec
tacular football game of the 1931
season.
The Southern Methodist "aerial
circus" buried St. Mary's under an
avalanche of passes, and drove
j down to the Gael one-yard line
three times, but each time a great
St. Mary's line arose to the occasion.
' The Moragans made their usual
1 second-half rally, and a flat pass
! from Bill Beasley to Bud Toscani
scored the winning touchdown in
the fourth quarter. A few minutes
later Delcabre, Mustang center,
blocked one of Angel Brovelli's
from behind the goal line. Fletcher
of St. Mary's was the last man to
touch it before it rolled out of
bounds for a safety.
Many Passes
The Texans completed eighteen
out of thirty-three passes. They
tossed one for fourteen yards on
j the second play of the game, and
kept it up all afternoon.
Early in the second quarter Gil
bert passed to Mason for a sure
touchdown, but Bill Fischer outran
l the Texan, and dragged him d6wn

on the ten-yard line. The Mustangs
got down to the one-yard line then,
and also a few minutes later.
Brovelli Fumbles
A fumble nearly gave the Texans
a score in the third quarter, but
again the Gaels held. Then St.
Mary's made a fine march of HO
yards, but Brovelli fumbled on the
one-yard line.
Bob Gilbert did the passing for
S.M.U. He looked one way, and
tossed a ball fifty yards in the op
posite direction. And the passes
were usually dead to the receiver.
The Southerners also had a short
pass behind the line which seldom
failed to gain five or ten yards.
Oliver, Mason, Travis, and Hawn
were all receivers of the Colvin and
Wellendorf calibre.
