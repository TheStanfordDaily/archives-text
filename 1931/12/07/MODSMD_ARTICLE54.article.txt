# POLICE ROUT HUNGER MARCHERS IN INDIANA
## 
### 

These trucks are part of the caravan of a so-called "national hunger army" enroute to Washington, D. C.,
from several midwest states. In Hammond, Ind., the hunger marchers were routed by police with tear bombs,
following a small riot. This picture shows some of the trucks in Chicago as they gathered for the final
lap of their trip of protest to the national capital.
