# CORELLI MUSIC TO BE FEATURED
## Stanford Symphony Will Perform Wednesday 
### 
Corelli's Christmas Concerto, de- (
picting in vivid style the Christmas |
story, will be played at the con- j
cert of the Stanford Symphony Or- ;
chestra to be held Wednesday eve- ,
ning at 8:15 o'clock in the Assem- l
bly Hall.
The theme of the Concerto is car- i
ried by three solo instruments, two j
violins and a 'cello, who take the j
part of the narrators, with the |
chamber orchestra in the guise of i
listeners making occasional remarks, j
The different movements describe j
in turn the bringing of glad tid- j
ings; the real Christmas story; the j
astonishment of the shepherds and i
their joyous arrival at the manger;
and the ringing of the Christmas
bells which usher in the Pastorale,
the song of the shepherds.
Although Corelli was a 17th cen- j
tury composer and the father of the j
early concert form, it is surprising |
to find the concert so admirably j
suited to a modern program.
Another number will be the en- j
treacte music from Carmen, the
most popular of all grand operas, j
This selection may be classed as |
one of the best beloved orchestral |
suites. The Toreador's Song is the 1
best-known melody of the compo- j
sition.
The concert is open to the public. |
