WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (/P). —
Cheering Democrats, returned to
legislative power after more than a
decade of defeats, took control of
the new House today and elected
John N. Garner their speaker.
Showing an impressive solidarity,
the party organization gave the
Texan 2IS votes to 207 hy the Re
publicans for Snell of New York.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (/P).—'The
nation's new Congress convened to
day in a calm, quiet manner that
belied under-surface tension and the
strife-filled issues awaiting its con
sideration.
The House went into the hands of
the Democrats. Joyful "rebel" yells
greeted the smiling veteran of the
party, John N. Garner of Texas, as
he ascended the speaker's rostrum,
last held by a Democrat twelve years
ago.
Republicans clung to their finger
hold in the Senate. It went through
the brief routine of swearing in new
members in a formal thirty-five
minute session. Its organization
problem will be settled tomorrow.
A dispute is impending on the re
election of George Moses of New
Hampshire as president pro tem.
To this divided and politically hos
tile Congress, President Hoover to
morrow will submit his legislative
recommendations and a report on
the state of the Union.
With tomorrow's reading of the
presidential message, the Congress
will plunge immediately into its task
of devising a way to speed Ameri
can prosperity. That is the keynote.
