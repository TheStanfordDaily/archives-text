A crowd larger and more enthu- j
j siastic than that which turns out i
j for most football rallies listened to !
| Chester Rowell explain at an all- i
j University assembly yesterday |
! morning the Manchurian situation, ;
; which he characterized as "the ma- !
j jor crisis of the world since the i
i Great War."
Dr. Swain, in introducing the j
j famed publicist and lecturer, point- j
1 ed out that Rowell had been in the j
Orient during one of the most criti- i
1 eal periods in Far Eastern history, j
Battleground
"Manchuria, long the battle- j
; ground of Asia, is now the Wild
West of the Far East," said Dr.
Rowell. "This region is Chinese in j
i law, population, and recognized j
I sovereignty. However, it is also the j
! goal of the aspirations and ambi- i
: tions of both Russia and Japan. This ,
| is bound to cause warfare."
Rowell's speech consisted of i
i stories, personal experiences, and i
i impressions of what he referred to '
I as a "pseudo war." The magnitude [
| of the situation, he said, is not due ;
| to the fighting but to lhe fact that |
Japan has ignored the League of J
1 Nations' demands to stop hostilities, j
' What government Manchuria has j
I doesn't matter, according to Rowell, j
j since the Manchurians are sure to !
I be robbed and oppressed by any J
I possible government.
Force Successful
"If Japan succeeds in her defiance I
i of the League, we must recognize J
! that the twentieth century methods j
of arbitration lose to the ninteenth- i
j century system of force." If this j
j first major challenge of the League |
I power is successful, said Rowell, |
j we must "arm to the teeth to be ;
j ready to lick the world."
j The Japanese saw that "the only j
j way that a colored nation could
j command the respect of the white J
i race was by force." Accordingly, '
■ Japan defeated Russia, and thus "by
J virtue of bloodshed and slaughter
; Japan was admitted to the brother
| hood of Christian nations."
Not Unexpected
"The international situation in 1
j Manchuria is not an unexpected or
i sudden thing. A series of events led
; up to it—culminating this Septem
l ber when one evening the Chinese j
I government controlled Manchuria i
' and the next morning it was in
j Japanese hands.
"The present policy of Japan is
I two-fold. Firstly, to help the Can
| ton rebels, who stand for a neu
| tralized Manchuria, dominate China.
I Secondly, that Manchuria shall not j
; be under any Chinese authority." 1

Force Successful
"If Japan succeeds in her defiance I
i of the League, we must recognize J
! that the twentieth century methods j
of arbitration lose to the ninteenth- i
j century system of force." If this j
j first major challenge of the League |
I power is successful, said Rowell, |
j we must "arm to the teeth to be ;
j ready to lick the world."
j The Japanese saw that "the only j
j way that a colored nation could
j command the respect of the white J
i race was by force." Accordingly, '
■ Japan defeated Russia, and thus "by
J virtue of bloodshed and slaughter
; Japan was admitted to the brother
| hood of Christian nations."
Not Unexpected
"The international situation in 1
j Manchuria is not an unexpected or
i sudden thing. A series of events led
; up to it—culminating this Septem
l ber when one evening the Chinese j
I government controlled Manchuria i
' and the next morning it was in
j Japanese hands.
"The present policy of Japan is
I two-fold. Firstly, to help the Can

| tralized Manchuria, dominate China.
I Secondly, that Manchuria shall not j
; be under any Chinese authority." 1
