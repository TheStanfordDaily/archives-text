MUKDEN, Manchuria, Dec. 7 (A 3 ).
Renewed activity by what the
Japanese termed "bandits" was re
ported by army headquarters to
night.
A Japanese colliery at Nyuhsintai
was looted by several hundred men,
who made prisoners of one of the
I officials and his family. Soldiers and
j police pursued the raiders.
There also were reports of bandit
activity at Yaochienhutse, on the
1 South Manchurian Railway.
TOKYO, Dec. 7 (A*).—The Japa
| nese government was described of-
ficially today as depending on Chang
; Hsueh-liang, deposed governor of
' Manchuria, to prevent armed con
-1 flict at Chinchow.
j Tokyo, it was said, was depending
i on Chang because the Chinese gov
j eminent had washed its hands of a
proposal to create a neutral zone in
! the Chinchow area.
PARIS, Dec. 7 (/P).—China, Japan
! and the League of Nations Council
i appeared tonight to be approaching
I agreement on how to dispose of
j Japan's demand for the right to act
j against bandits in Manchuria.
I But the question of Chinchow and

j remained to discourage hopes of an
early settlement of the conflict.
