# Maidens Undaunted By Stanford Men's Immunity

### PAUL ZULCH 
Undaunted by the traditional irn
! munity of the Stanford "rough" to
j the charms of the Five Hundred,
I Stanford's women graduates seek
I husbands elsewhere, according to
figures compiled from reports of
I Stanford alumni.
No one will be surprised by the
j fact that only 35$ of Stanford's
i male alumni marry Stanford wom
-1 en. But a vast blow is dealt to the
I ego of the Stanford man when it is
found that the Stanford women
i graduates disdain the lifetime com-
J panionship of their undergraduate
colleagues. Only 45% of the Five
Hundred marry Stanford men.
The statistics were obtained by a
i condensation of the facts reported
I on the information cards received
: this summer for the alumni direc-
I tory, which is soon to be printed.
In accordance with regular statisti
! cal procedure, 4230 typical cases
I were selected from the 20,000 alum-
I ni reports.
These 4230 cases included 3021
{men and 120!) women. 1382 men re

1 ported marriage. 408 of them, or
| 35%, married Stanford women. The
' report does not state how many of
the remaining 074 or 65% married
j graduates of Mills or Cal. One can
| only hazard a guess.
Of the 701 women who reported
marriage, 339, or 45%, said, "Yes,"
I to an impassioned Stanford "rough."
■ A baffling mystery shrouds the se
lections of the remaining 422, or
| 55%.
| Since only bona fide alumni who
I took undergraduate degrees at the
Farm are included in this survey,
J present undergraduates can draw
] as many conclusions as they like.
Mathematically inclined students
■ can perhaps figure out the possible
number of future 100% "Sons of
i the Stanford Red."
This data on the marriages of
Stanford graduates is part of an
extensive report on the vocations
of Stanford alumni prepared by the
vocational guidance division. The
full report will be published in the
near future.
