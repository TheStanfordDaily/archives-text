1 WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (/J').. — A
I band of 1,500 demonstrators which
j paraded peacefully about Washing
j ton today failed in its announced
I purpose of presenting demands for
; unemployment relief to President
Hoover and on the Senate floor.
| In fact, as nightfall found their
steps slow and their band silent,
j they had not officially made their
i program known either at the White
House or to Congress.
I At both places, their leaders re
fused to send in their demands after
I police blocked their entrance.
As the day ended the demonstra
| tors were informed by Pelham D.
| Glassford, superintendent of policc,
that no food and no shelter would
t be provided them alter tomorrow
| morning.
Ordered Out
Glassford added further that the
; leaders had been asked to move out
j of town early tomorrow.
There seemed almost as many po
j licemen as marchers today as the
| groups trekked toward the Capitol
I chanting, "We want unemployed in
! surance."
A motorcycle escort moved a few
j paces ahead of a gray-uniformed
band which played lustily the lied
j hymn, "The Internationale," on
i queer-looking instruments.
As the parade filed up Capitol
| Hill it saw policemen standing on
the Senate steps with sawed-ofl
j shotguns and sub - machine guns
glinting ominously in the bright
. sun. A double line of blue coats was
stretched along the east entrance to
the Capitol.
Brief Parley
A patrol wagon and an ambulance
were parked prominently in the
broad plaza in front of the Capitol.
The parley at the White House
I was brief and to the point. Richard
L. Jervis, chief of the White House
I secret service, told Benjamin ana
| other leaders they could not present
) their petitions to Mr. Hoover. He
j offered, however, to take the peti-
I tion for presentation to lhe Presi
dent.
Benjamin conferred with his lieu
j tenants as the band played the "In
ternationale" once more. Then ho
I announced he would not give Jer

The parley at the White House
I was brief and to the point. Richard
L. Jervis, chief of the White House
I secret service, told Benjamin ana
| other leaders they could not present
) their petitions to Mr. Hoover. He
j offered, however, to take the peti-
I tion for presentation to lhe Presi
dent.
Benjamin conferred with his lieu
j tenants as the band played the "In
ternationale" once more. Then ho
I announced he would not give Jer
! vis the petition.
