school for four quarters for a code violation. The student was found
guilty of turning in an English 2A report, supposedly his own work, and
which was found to be copied word for word from a well-known novel.

whole matter over to the council. The offender will be allowed to finish
this quarter's work, and will be refused re-admittance until January 1933.

to be one of the most flagrant cases

I land Comments
Urging that this case be accepted
| at its face value as a pertinent rc
| minder of the existence of the
j Honor Code, especially during the
| coming final examinations, Milton
i Hand, council chairman, made the
j following statement:
"We are now at a time when
j everyone is emotionally upset,
j There is always a great deal of
1 anxiety over finals and persons arc
j apt to be careless or act on impulse.
"Students should make every ef
! fort to be exempt from suspicion
| by taking alternate seats in exam-
I inations and by having no papers or
: books about them."
"Stamp Out Cheaters"
j Ed Boyles, secretary of the coun
j cil, in commenting on the case, dc
j clared:
j "Had this man participated in one
j of the freshman talks we are hav
j ing now he never would have com-
I mitted this act. We hope that by
! informing the freshmen and junior
college men we will build up a
| strong opinion against cheaters and
I so stamp them out."
i 'Be careful in the coming exam
: inations," warns Don Colvin, an
, other council member. "We want
|to remind all students to warn
j those persons seen cheating not to
I turn in their papers, since it is the
I act of turning in such papers that
j constitutes the breach of the code,
i and which is punishable by Men's
| Council action.
"By so warning others we cati
j make the Honor Code properly
! positive, instead of negative, in
! operation."
"Better Co-operation"
'"This case is a sign of that better
! co-operation between student body
' and council which is needed to es
tablish the Honor Code as a tradi
tion at. Stanford," declared Frank
Gerbode, also a council member.
"It is to be desired that the sus
pension of this student will serve
as sufficient warning to the campus
that the Honor Code is a serious
J thing—an institution—and one which
will be strictly enforced \jn the fu
| ture," AI Ray, the fifth member,
i stated.
