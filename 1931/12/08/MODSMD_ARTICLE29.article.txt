When students poured into the assembly hall yesterday
morning alter their 1) o'clock classes lo hear Chester Row
ell speak, they found the main floor already well filled by
people from Palo Alto and school children from surround
ing high schools and grammar schools.
The remaining seals in the assembly ball, both down
stairs and balcony, were soon taken. Jbil students still con
tinued to arrive and were forced to stand along the sides
and in the rear of the hall. Many left rather than remain
standing during the whole hour.
When speakers are brought here or programs presented
for the benefit of the students, they should at least have

the privilege of silling down during the program and out
siders, coming early, should not be permitted to fill up the
assembly hall while the students are still detained in their
classes.
