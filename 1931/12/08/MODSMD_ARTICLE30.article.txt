# THERE'LL BE FOOTBALL IN THE AIR

Reduction of admission prices lo conference football j
Raines and possible limitation of football broadcasts will be i
tinder discussion when the I'acific Coast Conference meets
next week.
Football receipts litis year sbowed the effects of the
present economic condition, and it is almost certain that j
prices for the coming season will be scaled down fifty cents |
or a dollar. That is a move in the right direction, but the i
proposal not lo broadcast any but sell-out games will cost
the Conference more in public goodwill than it will earn)
in increased gale receipts.
II is true that a great many followers of the game elect j
lo sit by tlie radio rather than travel .'5O miles and pay four I
or five dollars lo sec the gridders perform in person. Rut 1
many of those fans do go to a fair percentage of the games, j
If they are barred from hearing broadcasts of lite games I
they do not go 10, their interest in the pastime unless they'
arc real dyed-in-the-wool fans will lag considerably, and;
may possibly result in their not going to any games.
Radio broadcasts make converts of as many people as i
they keep from coming lo games. The Pacific Conference
will make a grave mistake !>y curtailing such features.
