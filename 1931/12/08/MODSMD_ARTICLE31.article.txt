The opportunity (o meet and talk with the Inen of note
who speak at the Tuesday evening lectures no longer de
pends on hanging to the coat tails of some professor who
might introduce you or waiting around until the crowd i
leaves in order to ask a few questions. Instead, immedi-i
atelv after the lecture an informal reception is held around 1
a fireplace in the Women's Clubhouse. Here students are I
served coffee and cookies, which are provided bv the
A.W'.S. hosplialitv committee, and the guest of the evening'
answers questions and talks informally.
The possibility of students meeting and talking infor
mally with the speaker after the lecture should attract
those who feel that an hour on any subject is too short and j
100 general to be of much worth. To miss the chance of!
knowing the personality as well as the ideas of the men
who come as guests to the Stanford campus is a different ;
proposi I ion.
