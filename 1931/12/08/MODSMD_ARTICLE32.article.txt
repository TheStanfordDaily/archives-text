# FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF JOURNALISM
## 
### 
Ever since schools and departments of journalism have
become established parts of the educational systems of
many universities in the I niled Stales, professional news
papermen have looked with something of dubiety upon
those students who have graduated in journalism and are
looking for jobs.
Part of this feeling is no doubl due to a sort of profes
sional suspicion arising from the newspaper shop tradition
thai a good newspaperman must by nature grow up in a
newspaper office. However, as college-trained journalists
are becoming more and more outstanding in the newspa
per field, there is a gradual lessening in the intensity of this
attitude.
Undoubtedly, the work of Ihe American Association of
Schools and Departments of Journalism has been a very
important factor in devising prospective courses of study
for Ihe journalism major, in line with the rapidly spread
ing idea that proper preparation for a journalist consists!
not in highly technical or specialized training, but in pro- i
viding the best possible liberal education, with only such'
technical material as is absolutely essential.
Stanford is one of the leaders in this movement, with j
only urn's in Ihe department required for graduation.
That leaves 1.10 unils of work, part of which is proscribed
in other departments and part of which is elective.
