# BULL SESSION
## THE 						END IS THE BEGINNING 
### 
They round the corner; they're in |
full sight now; you can almost i'eel \
their hot breath against your face—
Horses? No! Final examinations.
This is the last Daily of the quar
ter; a few more lectures in which [
professors will try to stumble over
half a quarter's work in four days; |
then a week of finals—and then a
small lump (about the size of two t
cubes of Domino sugar) rises in our (
throat —home.
As we cram for our finals, as we J
learn piles of facts for examina
tions, as we try to redigest notes j
collected in our desk drawer dur
ing the whole quarter—our thoughts ,
cannot help but stray. Soon it will
lie all over. We picture ourself lying i
on a comfortable divan with soft
music coming from nowhere in par- j
ticular playing selections from Vic
tor Herbert, Tschaikowsky, and
Rimski - Korsakof and nobody j
else. We are reading interesting
books that we have postponed all
during the quarter; the pages turn j
automatically as soon as we have
finished them; and if we care to
reach a finger, there are near at
hand dishes of imported English,
shortbread, white raisins, and salted
pecans. This condition of bliss goes |
on day after day; and we never
grow tired. The supply of books is j
never-ending and the dishes never
grow empty.
Suddenly, we become conscious
that the ink well's precious content
is dripping on our new Persian rug j
manufactured in Hoboken and
handed down to us from five gen- i

erations of Stanford men. We hur
riedly blot up the mess; and once
more begin our travail. The long
hours pull their tortuous paths
across the dull, dark day; and still
we sit gorging ourself with dry facts
and hurried summaries.
This is the way it works out in
theory, anyway.
Vacations are wonderful things;
to be bored or be unable to find
something to do is a serious indict
ment against college students. With
pll the laborers freed from their
jobs, of course, it will be very dif
ficult for poor college students to
find employment this year. Even the
Post Office is giving work only to
married men or single men who
will state they are married. There
will probably be many college stu
dents working in the Post Office—
even this year.
Those who do not work will have
the entire vacation to do those
things cultural that a college educa
tion sometimes seems to interfere
with. And of course the entire stu
dent body will spend the precious
days of the fleeting vacation in
things intellectual. Is not that the
purpose of a college education?
Well, even though it is a bit pre
mature, we hope that everybody's
Santa Claus has refrained from
playing the market too heavily; and
that no one will have trouble get
ting their (or will find runners in
their stockings—as the case may be)
tux collar on when the nine o'clock
curfew blows on New Year's Eve.
