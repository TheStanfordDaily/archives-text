### 
; Today the Windjammer sings his
I quarter's swan song and prepares
! to assume the garments of a monk
before sitting in alternate seats and
Writing Pledges. He wishes peace
and good will on earth to all, know
ing that at least they can have that
| this Christmas.
The Windjammer thanks you all
for giving him cognizance between
your morning snail (small buttered),
and if you haven't, well, just don't
destroy his illusions. He thanks you
for reading his pearls of wisdom,
even if you didn't always under
stand them. For instance, on No
vember 23, when speaking of foot
ball teams he was really writing
of Sex, a topic of which you may
have heard, but most people mis
took him and thought he was talk
| ing about Sex.
| On December 2, under the guise
| of humor, he discussed on Women
I Must Live, But Why. The Wind-
I jammer is very subtle this . way,
' sometimes getting beyond his au
thor, so that on October 24 he ar
gued for Free Love while his au
thor thought he was assailing the
Smoot-Kawley tariff bill.
Nevertheless, the Windjammer
wishes you a Merry Christmas but
advises you not to peek at Santa
as he rolls into ihe fireplace, as it
is rumored he has not been doing
so well and has lost some of his
j avoirdupois.
(P.S.: Don't mind any of that
| gratitude stuff in the first part. We
! just said that. —Windjammer. How
j did you know?— Author.)
