# RAIL BROTHERHOODS PLAN SIX-HOUR DAY
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. (/P)—Railway j
unions worked today on a perma- !
nent program for shorter hours be- j
fore tackling the emergency prob- I
lem of reduced wages.
First separately and then to- j
gethcr, the Four Big Brotherhoods — \
Engineers, Firemen, Conductors, and 1
Trainmen—and the union of Switch- J
men took up the problem of per- j
manent stabilization of employment j
and the spreading of work through j
shorter hours per man.
One of the principal proposals was J
the six-hour-day and although the I
report of the Committee of 35, or- !
ganized last year, was carefully'
guarded, many leading union execu- j
tives openly favored the plan.
