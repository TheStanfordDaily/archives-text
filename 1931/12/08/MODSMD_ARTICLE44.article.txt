## Individual Photography In Campus Studio Is Innovation 
### 
A general survey made yesterday
of the work done on the 1932 Quad
during the past quarter indicates on
the whole a progress in advance of
previous yearbooks. In addition to
the completion of much of the pre
liminary organization, work has been
commenced on several of the many
new features which the '32 Quad
will contain.
Individual photography, constitut
ing the bulk of the fall quarter
work, is practically finished. The
campus studio, an innovation over
systems previously used by Quad
staffs, closes Thursday after a final
week of winding up photos of sen
iors and living group members. It
will be open again during the fh'st
three weeks of the winter quarter
in order to accommodate students
entering at that time.
Pictures Chosen
All football action and individual
snaps have been chosen and the
football section, to be written by

be completed over the holidays. All
soccer photos have been laid out as
well.

has long been typical of previous
Quads, will bo achieved in the 1932

David Starr Jordan,"' will be writ
