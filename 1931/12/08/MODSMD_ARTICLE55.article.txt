# WORLD BANK GROUP STUDIES DEBT CRISIS
## 
### 
BASEL, Switzerland, Dec. 7 (/P). â€”
The World Bank Committee to study
the reparations problem raised by
the German economic crisis met and
organized today with one eye on the
opening of the United States Con
gress.
The banking experts who make
up the committee were interested in
what Congress v/ill do in regard to
the Hoover moratorium. They ex
pected the one-year debt holiday to
be ratified, but they recognized that
a defeat for the moratorium in Con
gress would change their entire pro
ceedings.
