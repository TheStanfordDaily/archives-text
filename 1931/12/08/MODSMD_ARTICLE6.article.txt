# SMITH LEAVES FOR CONVENTION
## Meeting Will Deal With Journalism Problems 
### 
Representing the Stanford De- !
partment of Journalism, Professor
Everett W. Smith will leave for
Minneapolis immediately after fin a',
examinations next week to attend J
the annual conventions of the
American Association of Schools j
and Departments of Journalism and ;
the American Association of Teach
ers of Journalism. Smith is vice- ;
president of the former. Both meet -
ings are to be conducted during the !
Christmas holidays in the Gopher i
city.
The annual conventions, which :
were held in Boston last year, will j
deal with teaching problems and i
affairs of interest to the journal m
departments. The conferences, as ]
last year, will probably strive for a !
broader scope in journalism courses
than is offered at the present time.:
Aiming to secure a liberal eduea- j
tion as the preparatory course for a j
journalism major instead of specific |
journalism as an introduction to the 1
profession, the delegates will con- i
cern themselves mainly with a dis
cussion of this situation.
