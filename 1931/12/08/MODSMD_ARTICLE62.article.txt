RADIO BROADCASTING and
admission prices are expected to be
the major issues considered at the
annual meeting of representatives
of the Pacific Coast Conference, to
be held in San Francisco next Mon
day.
It is possible that the microphone
may be banished from all but sell
cut games, while admission prices
may be dropped in an attempt to
lure those who have been staying
home to listen to Don Thompson
or Ernie Smith.

Stanford game, for instance,
selling for $2.00, it is small won
der that many football fans
satisfied themselves with the
radio report. Winning touch
downs in the last nine seconds
cannot be guaranteed before
hand.
Now if the radio menace were
eliminated and the admission price
lowered to a more reasonable figure,
larger crowds would undoubtedly
greet such games.
NORTHWESTERN SCHOOLS are
lined up solidly against the micro
phone. Up there crowds have never
been anything to write home about,
the weather being such an uncer
tain iVctor that many fans prefer
to take their football by the fireside.
Another argument against
radio is that the unversities
concerned receive no remunera
tion for allowing the broad
casts to he made, while the
chains use the games as a profit
able advertising medium.
It is hardly likely that a ban will
be placed on ali game broadcasts,
but some agreement is expected to
be reached whereby only sell-out
games will be released by all sta
tions, lesser tilts being broadcast
only at the home city of the travel
ing team.
ONLY ONE football game of im
portance remains to be played in
the Bay Region this year—the an
nual East-West tilt in Kezar sta
dium on New Year's Day.
No official, invitations have been
issued to Stanford players as yet,
as Percy Locey, coach of the west
ern entry, has been occupied with
Olympic Club affairs at Honolulu.
It is expected, however, that bids
will be issued to two or three In
dians from the following: Neill,
Hulen, Ehrhorn, and Hillman.
I'liil MofTatt would be a logi
cal choice, particularly since he
is not going to play basketball,
but his knee injury will prob
ably prevent his playing. Phil
was glad of the chance to par

his last for Stanford, but felt
that he was far from his usual

RADIO BROADCASTING and
admission prices are expected to be
the major issues considered at the
annual meeting of representatives
of the Pacific Coast Conference, to
be held in San Francisco next Mon
day.
It is possible that the microphone
may be banished from all but sell
cut games, while admission prices
may be dropped in an attempt to
lure those who have been staying

Now if the radio menace were
eliminated and the admission price
lowered to a more reasonable figure,
larger crowds would undoubtedly
greet such games.
NORTHWESTERN SCHOOLS are
lined up solidly against the micro

chains use the games as a profit

It is hardly likely that a ban will
be placed on ali game broadcasts,

No official, invitations have been
issued to Stanford players as yet,
as Percy Locey, coach of the west
ern entry, has been occupied with
Olympic Club affairs at Honolulu.
It is expected, however, that bids
will be issued to two or three In

Hulen, Ehrhorn, and Hillman.
I'liil MofTatt would be a logi
