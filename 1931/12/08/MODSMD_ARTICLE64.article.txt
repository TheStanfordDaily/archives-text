With a new policy of eliminating
mid-season practice ,gai?:es, Stan
ford's 1932 basketball schedule of
17 games was announced yesterday.
The first game will be played
against San Jose State on Decem
ber 22.
The conference season will open
against U.C.L.A. here on January 8
and will continue until February 20
when the final game of the Cali
| fornia - Stanford series will be
played here. During this conference
I season there will be no practice
; games, a policy which according to
! Coach John Bunn has handicapped
! the team in former years.
"Mid-week games during the sea
■ son interrupt an entire week's prac
! tice," said Bunn yesterday, com
! menting on the change.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal quintet
! is rapidly taking shape with about
| 8 men added to the squad since the
football team returned from Dart
; mouth. Lambert, Tod, Norgard,
| Doub, Baker, and Rintala reported
I for practice last night. "Frenchy"
> Lacombe is expected also to join the
j squad later.
A new development in the fight
j for varsity berths was the disclosure
