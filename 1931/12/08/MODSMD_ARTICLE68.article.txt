# Lassiter, Caddel, Steckel, a Triumvirate that Weaved And Sprinted Their Way to Seven Touchdowns
## 
### 
It was expected, before the big
Eastern games of November 28
(Army-Notre Dame, Yale-Prince
ton, and Stanford-Dartmouth) that
the three bright stars would be
Marehy Schwartz of Plunk Ander
son's "Irish," Albie Bfl&th of the Eli
Bulldogs, and either "Wild Bill"
Morton or Bill McCall of the White
Indians of Hanover. Bui in each
game the expectations went astray,
for Albie Booth was ill and was
unable to play against Princeton,
and his understudy, young Bob
Lassiter, proved quite capable of
filling the "Mighty Atom's" shoes;
Schwartz was outplayed by Ray
Stecker of the Army; and Dart
mouth's pair of "Sweet Williams'
were almost completely held ir
check by Stanford's clever pass de
fense, so that Ernie Caddel of Pop
Warner's team quite stole the show
with three touchdowns, two on
long, dazzling runs, to his credit.
Lassiter, Caddel, and Stecker —
what a triumvirate! Three names to
conjure with, three hip-swinging,
shadowy spectres that weaved and
wiggled and sprinted away from the
outstretched arms of would-be
tacklers, three heroes of three big
games, who between them scored

seven touchdowns 160,000
people!
Ray Stecker seems to be one of
those individuals whom Fate picks
on more than once to be the hero
of the hour. Last year, in the Army-
Navy charity game, Ray ran 56
yards to score the only touchdown
of the game. This year he made a
67-yard run through the whole
Notre Dame team to a touchdown,
after previously putting Army in a
position to make its first score by
taking Brown's pass and running
to the 7-yard line. Bob Lassiter
scored thrice on the hapless Prince
ton team, once on a 95-yard return
of a kickoff, while Ernie Caddel
amazed Eastern sports writers who
had never even heard of him by
running 72 yards to a touchdown on
the very first scrimmage play of the
game, then scoring twice more, once
on a 64-yard run, and once after
catching Moffat t's pass.

Lassiter, proved quite capable of
filling the "Mighty Atom's" shoes;
Schwartz was outplayed by Ray
Stecker of the Army; and Dart
mouth's pair of "Sweet Williams'
were almost completely held ir
check by Stanford's clever pass de
fense, so that Ernie Caddel of Pop
Warner's team quite stole the show
with three touchdowns, two on
long, dazzling runs, to his credit.
Lassiter, Caddel, and Stecker —
what a triumvirate! Three names to
conjure with, three hip-swinging,
shadowy spectres that weaved and
wiggled and sprinted away from the
outstretched arms of would-be
tacklers, three heroes of three big
games, who between them scored

seven touchdowns 160,000
people!
Ray Stecker seems to be one of
those individuals whom Fate picks
on more than once to be the hero
of the hour. Last year, in the Army-
Navy charity game, Ray ran 56
yards to score the only touchdown
of the game. This year he made a
67-yard run through the whole
Notre Dame team to a touchdown,
after previously putting Army in a
position to make its first score by
taking Brown's pass and running
to the 7-yard line. Bob Lassiter
scored thrice on the hapless Prince
ton team, once on a 95-yard return
of a kickoff, while Ernie Caddel
amazed Eastern sports writers who
had never even heard of him by
running 72 yards to a touchdown on
the very first scrimmage play of the
game, then scoring twice more, once
on a 64-yard run, and once after
catching Moffat t's pass.
