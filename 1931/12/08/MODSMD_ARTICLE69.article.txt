# G.O.P. FEARS FIGHT IN SENATE AGAINST MOSES' RE-ELECTION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (/P).â€”Sen
ate Republican leaders expressed
tonight over the consequences of the
fight impending against the re-elec
tion of George Moses, of New Hamp
shire, as president pro tempore.
Loss of Senate control to the Dem
ocrats and days of balloting on the
issue were the two consequences
uppermost in the minds of party
chieftains as they held conferences
on the situation due to break on the
Senate floor tomorrow.
Senator Moses, who first stirred
the wrath of the western Republican
Independents by terming them the
"sons of the wild jackass" declined
to comment on the fight against him
by this group.
