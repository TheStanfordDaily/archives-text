# BREAKERS, TORO FAVORED FOR MURAL TRACK TITLE
## 
### 
When the preliminaries of the in
tramural track meet are held to
morrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
sharp, the battle for team honors
will also begin with Breakers or El
Toro favored to win the champion
ship. Last year Breakers set a new
record of 58 points while winning
the title, and Delta Tau Delta was
second. However, the Delts seem to
have no serious threat this time, as
Bob Jones, who was practically
their whole track team, has gradu
ated to the varsity.
Breakers' hopes for a repeat vic
tory are somewhat dimmed by the
inability of Les Hables to compete.
Hables, who won three events last
fall, is now a block "S" man. How
ever, Bud Gordon, who holds both
intramural hurdle records, will be
on deck to defend his titles, and
Frank Fullenwider has a good
chance to win either the 440 or the
880.
In addition, Breakers have Jim
Ferrie, who should also chalk up
points in the middle distance runs,
and Phil Mcrentim, who is almost a

certainty to win the two-mile. Will
Harwood will run the dashes or the
440 for Breakers, and Red Cross,
Dick Philippi, and Phil Johnston
will lend strength in the 880, the
javelin, and the sholput respectively.
El Toro's best bets are Dick
Wright and Cotton Herbert. Wright
is a slight favorite over Fullenwider
in the half-mile, while Herbert is ;i
standout in the low hurdles and
should also place in the highs. Tex
Byrd will be out to defend his rec
ord in the high-jump, and Roy
Hundley, who has been improving
steadily all year, should register
points in cither the 220 or the quai -
ter-mile. Parker Reed will probably
be one of the first three men to
finish in both dashes, Carley should
place in one of the distance races.
The Alpha Delts appear to be the
only Row team that has a chance to
upset the dope. Sam Eastman is a
cinch in the niile, and Jimmie Will
son has a chance to cop the. 100 and
perhaps nose out A1 Blackman in
the 220. Naylon in the 880 and Ber
ryhill in the broad jump are other
Alpha Delts who may place.

certainty to win the two-mile. Will
Harwood will run the dashes or the
440 for Breakers, and Red Cross,
Dick Philippi, and Phil Johnston
will lend strength in the 880, the
javelin, and the sholput respectively.
El Toro's best bets are Dick
Wright and Cotton Herbert. Wright
is a slight favorite over Fullenwider
in the half-mile, while Herbert is ;i
standout in the low hurdles and
should also place in the highs. Tex
Byrd will be out to defend his rec
ord in the high-jump, and Roy
Hundley, who has been improving
steadily all year, should register
points in cither the 220 or the quai -
ter-mile. Parker Reed will probably
be one of the first three men to
finish in both dashes, Carley should
place in one of the distance races.
The Alpha Delts appear to be the
only Row team that has a chance to
upset the dope. Sam Eastman is a
cinch in the niile, and Jimmie Will
son has a chance to cop the. 100 and
perhaps nose out A1 Blackman in
the 220. Naylon in the 880 and Ber
ryhill in the broad jump are other
Alpha Delts who may place.
When the preliminaries of the in
tramural track meet are held to
morrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
sharp, the battle for team honors
will also begin with Breakers or El
Toro favored to win the champion
ship. Last year Breakers set a new
record of 58 points while winning
the title, and Delta Tau Delta was
second. However, the Delts seem to
have no serious threat this time, as
Bob Jones, who was practically
their whole track team, has gradu
ated to the varsity.
Breakers' hopes for a repeat vic
tory are somewhat dimmed by the
inability of Les Hables to compete.
Hables, who won three events last
fall, is now a block "S" man. How
ever, Bud Gordon, who holds both
intramural hurdle records, will be
on deck to defend his titles, and
Frank Fullenwider has a good
chance to win either the 440 or the
880.
In addition, Breakers have Jim
Ferrie, who should also chalk up
points in the middle distance runs,
and Phil Mcrentim, who is almost a

certainty to win the two-mile. Will
Harwood will run the dashes or the
440 for Breakers, and Red Cross,
Dick Philippi, and Phil Johnston
will lend strength in the 880, the
javelin, and the sholput respectively.
