This may appear funny to you but to Jim Thorpe it was a bit un
nerving. Thorpe, considered by many the greatest football player of

Seattle but missed the pigskin as the above picture shows. Wearing the
moleskins of early grid days, the former Carlisle Indian star blamed
his shin guards and proceeded to bang out several long punts after
removing them.
