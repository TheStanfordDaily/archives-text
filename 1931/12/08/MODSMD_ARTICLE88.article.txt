# MURAL TOUCH FOOTBALL SEMI-FINALS PLAY TODAY
## 
### BOB WADE 
Today's Schedule ,
Alpha Delts vs. A.T.0., Grays'
field, 4 o'clock
!'! Toro vs. Phi Kaps, Fr.F.B.,
4 o'clock
With only three games left in the
; intramural football playoff, the last
I two semifinals today, and the finals
| scheduled for Thursday, the grid j
j scramble has been narrowed down
I to four teams.
The Alpha Dolts, previously dan
| gerous for their fast running at
j tack, burst forth in their last game ;
! with the A.K.L.'s and displayed a
j dazzling aerial offense that had
| them in enemy territory a good part
j of the game. The condition of the
! field this afternoon will have much
I to do with the game which they
I decide to play. Long runs around
j end don't click so well on a slick
j grass field.
j A.T.O. presents an attack that is
i similar to the Alpha Delt drive
j with perhaps a little bit better aerial i
I game. Watch Naylon, Arbuckle, and
! Clarke!
El Toro is the dark horse in the !
| playoffs. Not that they weren't sup- I
j posed.to be there, but they had a
I small league, and are just getting
i into really high-class competition. I

, Judging from what little is known
i of their offense, and from the well
known Phi Kap overhead attack, the
air should be full of passes until
far into the night. Toro should be
| favored, if the record hung up by
the eating clubs in mural competi
tion means anything, but the Phi
Kaps have a defense that is hard
to pierce, and they have had more
games against tougher opponents.
Watch the Loomis-to-Mires, and
Woodworth- or Irsfeld-to-Church
i ill combinations!
