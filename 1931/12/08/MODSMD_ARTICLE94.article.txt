## Former Stanford Student Creates Studies Of S.F. Scenes 
### 
A series of photographic prints on j
display at the Stanford Bookstore i
represent the work of a former J
Stanford student who has been very |
successful along this line of occu- j
pation. His pictures of familiar spots
and places in San Francisco are, to j
say the least, unusual in their treat- ,
ment.
Ward Foultz, '29, is the man who
has accomplished this, al+ within the
space of a few months.
The scenes he has chosen are var
ied and suggestive, yet they are fa
miliar to the person who is only
slightly acquainted with San Fran- I
cisco's haunts. Such locations as ;
Russian Hill, Pershing Square, Fish- j
ermen's Wharf, Chinatown, and the i
Shell Oil building are treated inter
estingly and effectively.
A striking print taken from the ■
roof of the Shell Oil building takes i
advantage of the different angles j
and geometric lines of fire-escapes, ;
sky-lights, and other architectural
structures.
Light and shadow are used to ad- :
vantage in many of them, especially |
in that of the Pershing Square print, j
The Fishermen's Wharf picture has ,
been pronounced excellent. Here !
the reflections of the boats in the
water, together with the piles of the
pier, are the main features.
