SAN FRAN, Jan. 4— —Japan's j
deepest apologies were presented ,
last night for the attack by three
Japanese soldiers in Mukden Sun
clay on Culver B. Chamberlain,
American Consul.
Lieutenant-Colonel Matsui, mem- I
ber of the staff of General Shigeru
Honjo, Japan's Manchurian com- |
mander, expressed the opinion that .
Mr. Chamberlain was attack because j
he had treated Japanese soldiers "as '
if they were Chinese."
Consul "Arrogant"
> At a preliminary hearing con- !
ducted by Japanese authorities it j
was brought out that the three men |
who set upon Mr. Chamberlain as he !
stepped out of an automobile bear- i
ing the United States flag and coat j
of arms, blamed the American's j
"'arrogant, provocative attitude" for |
the trouble.
The Japanese government's apolo
gies were presented to Myrl S.
Myers, American Consul-General,
by Kazuhito Morishima, temporarily
in charge of the Japanese consulate. |
Colonel Apologizes
M. Morishima informed Mr. Myers J
that Lieutenant-Colonel Hyakutake, I
chief of the Japanese military mis- J
sion at Harbin, had expressed the
apologies of the army to Mr. Cham- !
berlain at the American consulate 1
there.
After being treated for his wounds
—which included two deep gashes in
his face—Mr. Chamberlain continued :
from Mukden to Harbin. He is tak- j
ing up his post there after a vaca
tion in America. His home is in
Kansas City.
Attackers Identified
Two privates in the army and a j
Japanese interpreter, temporarily J
engaged because of his knowledge j
of Chinese, were identified as the j
three attackers, M. Morishima said. '
He informed the Consul-General j
that the interpreter had been dis
missed and the two privates arrested
pending decision about whether they
should •be court-martialed. The j
Japanese authorities, he explained i
considered the privates less culpable I
than the interpreter.
