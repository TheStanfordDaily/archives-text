# CANOE SEASON OPENS AT TEN O'CLOCK TODAY
## Tests Of Swimming Ability Will Be Given Daily At Encina Pool 
### 
At 10 o'clock this morning an ap
parently dead Stanford tradition will
| return to life when Lagunita is of
] fically opened for boating and swim-
I ming for the first time in two years,
i The same rain that spoiled the va
! cations of many Stanfordites is re-
I sponsible for the present moist con
' dition of the lake, and the past two
weeks' downpour has succeeded in
filling Lagunita to within four inches
J of its top.
Students wishing to canoe on
Lagunita must first pass a test that
is given under the control of the
swimming department. The men's
test consists of swimming 100 yards
any stroke or combination of strokes,
of retrieving a Ford rim from nine
feet of water, and of swimming the
! width of the Encina pool under wa
-1 ter. This test will be given in the
1 pool every day starting Thursday
i from 10 to 4 o'clock by both Myron
Sprague and Nort Thornton.
The women's test is similar, but
' no plans have been made as yet for
giving the women the opportunity
' to pass the tests as the women's pool
! has been drained for the entire
j winter quarter.
All students who passed the test
in the good old days before Lagu
nita became dry will not have to
repeat them. Swimming Coach
Brandsten is in charge of Lagunita,
and anyone wishing to use the lake
| must present his or her "canoc test"
card before being allowed on the
water.
