POONA (India), Jan. 4.—(By As
sociated Press.) —Mahatma Gandhi,
back in jail for his part in the re
newal of the civil disobedience cam
paign, issued a remarkable set of
commands to the Indian people to
day immediately after his arrest.
First—Withdraw every form of
co-operation from the Government.
Second—Carry out the resolutions
of the Congress working committee
no matter what hardship or loss of
life and property is involved.
Third—Discard every trace of vio
lence from your heart; give absolute
protection to every English man,
woman or child.
Fourth —Discard all drugs and
narcotics and intoxicating drinks.
Fifth—Fast, pray, meditate.
Sixth—Remember that the boy
cott is our main weapon. There may
be ordinances by the dozens, arrests
galore, massacre unbridled. This is
the price every nation pays for its
freedom. The boycott is the weapon
which will bring England to her
knees. No power on earth can make
you buy a thing unless you wish to.
Seventh—Refuse to touch any
thing British. Regarding other for
eign goods, buy them only if you
cannot dispense with them. Remem
ber that every imported article
means customs revenue for the gov
ernment—money which will go to
wards the purchase of munitions to
kill you and those you love.
Eighth—lt is your bounden duty
to prevent every cent from going
into the Government coffers. Use
the posts, telegraphs and railroads
as little as possible, because these
are the means by which the Gov
ernment extorts revenue from you.
Ninth—Refuse to buy any Gov
ernment securities.
Tenth—Discard foreign garments
and wear homespun.
