# Stork Alarms Robleites Lake, Yule Gift To Campus, Lures Fowl Nautical Sports Assured

A lake—one hundred million gal
lons of it—was old Dame Nature's
Christmas present delivered yester- !
day to a surprised and heretofore
land-ridden campus.
First dramatic efTcct of its pres
ence broke early yesterday morning
| on neighboring Roble.
An alarm of "Hey, here comes a j
, stork!" sounded by an early riser, j
brought a wary Roble out of bed on
| the instant, slamming windows in i
precaution. While three floors of
pajama-clad Robleans watched with
j suspicion, a tall, white stork alighted
in Governor's Meadow, and moved
his conventionally long legs Roble
ward.
Pleased with his preliminary
scout-work, he took a last mental
note, and floated away on a breath
taking flap of white wings, pausing i
to circle over Roble chimney pots '
I with evident favor.

i was probably a gigantic California J

the marsh-land, attracted in passing
i by the silvery face of Lagunita and j
