# BLOODY RIOTS IN INDIA MARK GANDHI ARREST
## British Jail Three Leaders Of All-India National Liberty Congress 
### 
BOMBAY, INDIA, Jim. 4.—(/P>—
Th e renewed struggle between
India's Nationalist millions and the
British government, brought to a
head with the arrest of Mahatma
Gandhi, drew its first blood today.
In a clash between police and Na
tionalist demonstrators at Allahabad,
two men were killed, one of them
trampled to death. Many others
were injured and 30 were arrested.
The British government armed it
self for the renewal of the fray with
a group of drastic new ordinances,
one of which authorized a declara
tion that the working committee of
the All-Indian National Congress
was an organization wholly without
the law, and could be so treated.
At Cawnpore, city of a tragic repu
tation for successive outbreaks and
disorders starting with the Indian
Mutiny, police armed with lathis
(staves) twice charged crowds of
demonstrators, and throughout India
there was great tension and anxiety,
for many more clashes between the
forces of the government and the
unwielding believers in Mr. Gandhi's
policy of non-violence were expected
to follow.
Meanwhile, in his cell at Yeroda
jail near Poona, the Mahatma issued
a set of commands to the Indian peo
ple, directing them to withdraw
every form of co-operation from the
government, to discard every trace
of violence, and to boycott every
article of British goods, for "the boy
cott is the weapon which will bring
England to her knees."
The government showed its strong
hand by sentencing Jawaharlal Ne
hru, second only to Mr. Gandhi
among the Nationalist leaders, to
two years at hard labor for his anti-
British activities. Rajendra Prasad,
who was nominated to suceed Val
labhai Patel, as president of the Na
tional Congress because Patel was
arrested at the same time Mr.
Gandhi was taken into custory, was
himself made prisoner by the gov
ernment.
