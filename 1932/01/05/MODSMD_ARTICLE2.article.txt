# DISPLAY OF CAMERA STUDIES BY ARTIST SHOWN IN GALLERY
## 
### 
A number of artistic photographs
by the nationally known artist, Ed
ward Weston, of Carmel, will be
shown at the Stanford Art Gallery
until January 31, according to
Franklin Lemos, director of the gal
lery.
Weston chooses as subjects com
mon objects, as twisted seaweed,
pebbles on a beach, a wind-carved
sandstone, a group of Mexican ollas.
in these he sees beauty, and he ex
presses it with his camera as an
artist would with his brush. His
lighting effects make his work very
interesting.
Prominent artists and critics,
among them Diego Rivera, who
executed the murals on the walls
of the San Francisco stock exchange,
have commented favorably on Wes
ton's art, and his photographs have
been exhibited in many art galleries,
including El Museo del Estado at
Guadalajara, Mexico, and Koenig
Albert Museum at Zwickau, Ger
many. The New York Times re
cently devoted two pages to repro
ductions of his work.
