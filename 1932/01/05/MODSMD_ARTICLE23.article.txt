# Cardinal Cagers Turn Back Santa Clarans, 30-26
## Indians Strong in First Half, But Broncos Dominate Second Half, Reducing Early Lead of Cards To One Point at Third Quarter FIRST CONFERENCE GAMES TO BE WITH U.C.L.A. LaCombe Again High Point Man With Five Floor Shots; Cordry Second With Four Field Goals 
### LOWELL COX 
i STAVING OFF a determined rally in the closing minutes of play, the
Stanford Indians last night nosed out the Santa Clara Bronco quintet,
30 to 2(>, in the final game before the conference schedule opens.
A packed Pavilion saw the Farm five take an early lead and run (he
J score up to 1!) to 9 at half time, then watched it gradually dwindle as the
rangy Broncos settled down to business. With Slavich, Soldate, Spotts
wood, and Nicholas finding their shooting eyes, the Indian lead was soon

reduced to a single point, the score
board reading 25 to 21 half way
through the period.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry brought a
roar from the Stanford side of the
house as he lobbed in a field goal
over Ihe upstretched hands of Sla
vich, but Niles countered with a
beautiful long shot. Hancock sunk
a free throw, and Schnetka, guard,
dribbled the length of the floor to
score a field goal unassisted to give
Stanford a four-point lead with
only a minute to play.
Cards Start Strong
The Indians stalled until the gun
and were mighty thankful for a
two-basket win.
After starting out strongly, Ihe
Stanford quintet lapsed into ragged
ness that at times reminded of the
early season slump. Packard was
off form at center and left the floor
near the end of the game with four
personals chalked against him.
The Broncos, taking late advan
tage of greater height and bulk,
dominated the game in the second
half. They always got the ball from
the backboard, and took advantage
of a sudden attack of fumibilitis
suffered by the Indians.
LaCombe Good
"Frenchy" LaCombe, former Palo
Alto High School star, again took
high-point honors, sinking five field
goads and a free throw for a total
of 11 tallies. Cordry, finding his
shooting eye, trailed close behind
with four field goals.
Reggie Meade made his initial
bow of the season for Stanford, re
placing Cordry for a short while in
the second half. He wasn't up to
usual form, but is expected to see
much service in future games.
Coach John Bunn will this after
noon start the last lap of practice
before the Indians open the con
ference schedule against U.C.L.A.
Friday and Saturday.

half. They always got the ball from
the backboard, and took advantage
of a sudden attack of fumibilitis
suffered by the Indians.
LaCombe Good
"Frenchy" LaCombe, former Palo
Alto High School star, again took
high-point honors, sinking five field
goads and a free throw for a total
of 11 tallies. Cordry, finding his
shooting eye, trailed close behind
with four field goals.
Reggie Meade made his initial
bow of the season for Stanford, re
placing Cordry for a short while in
the second half. He wasn't up to
usual form, but is expected to see
much service in future games.
Coach John Bunn will this after
noon start the last lap of practice
before the Indians open the con
ference schedule against U.C.L.A.

i STAVING OFF a determined rally in the closing minutes of play, the
Stanford Indians last night nosed out the Santa Clara Bronco quintet,
30 to 2(>, in the final game before the conference schedule opens.
A packed Pavilion saw the Farm five take an early lead and run (he
J score up to 1!) to 9 at half time, then watched it gradually dwindle as the
rangy Broncos settled down to business. With Slavich, Soldate, Spotts
wood, and Nicholas finding their shooting eyes, the Indian lead was soon

reduced to a single point, the score
board reading 25 to 21 half way
through the period.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry brought a
roar from the Stanford side of the
house as he lobbed in a field goal
over Ihe upstretched hands of Sla
vich, but Niles countered with a
beautiful long shot. Hancock sunk
a free throw, and Schnetka, guard,
dribbled the length of the floor to
score a field goal unassisted to give
Stanford a four-point lead with
only a minute to play.
Cards Start Strong
The Indians stalled until the gun
and were mighty thankful for a
two-basket win.
After starting out strongly, Ihe
Stanford quintet lapsed into ragged
ness that at times reminded of the
early season slump. Packard was
off form at center and left the floor
near the end of the game with four
personals chalked against him.
The Broncos, taking late advan
tage of greater height and bulk,
dominated the game in the second
half. They always got the ball from
the backboard, and took advantage
of a sudden attack of fumibilitis
suffered by the Indians.
