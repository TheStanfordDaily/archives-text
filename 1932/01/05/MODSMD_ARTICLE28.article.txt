# WHY NOT THE BEST?

After Iho final basketball game with California last
ay in I it, the Daily protester! against the brand of officiating j
that had marker! the 11)31 Pacific Coast Conference season.!
That protest was interpreted by other college newspapers
ami city sport writers as ;in excuse for Stanford's defeat at;
the hands of the (iolrlen Hears.- something it was not in
tended to be.
To preclude the possibility of another such interpreta-)
lion, the Daily is making its 1932 protest before the con-i
lerence season gels under way. The 1931 season was |
marker! bv objections, official ant! otherwise, by coaches
and players alike against the referees. Virtually the same;
group of men who .worked in the major contests last year
will officiate this year.
In the six practice games Stanford has played to dale, j
flic work of these officials has been no better than it was
last year. Coach John Bunn of the Stanford varsity says
he has no complaint to make, but surely lie cannot be com
pletely satisfied with what he has seen in the way of ref-j
ereeing. Last night's contest featured Ned Kay and Lloyd 1
Leilh as referees, and it must be admitted that they were
acceptable, at best. But it was not clean-cut; it was as
sloppy as the game itself.
Of the men who have been handling the whistles to i
dale, Herb Dana and Ned Kay have been the most com-}
petent. Dana refereed in the opener against San Jose State!
and acquitted himself well; Kay is really a high-class of-j
fieial, but lie has too-frequent off nights when his work is
far below standard. The resl of the men have simply not;
deliverer! the goods.
The answer to previous protests has been the statement
that these men are the best available. The writer knows!
of two men who are far and away better than any of the I
referees who grace Stanford courts. They are Frank!
Needles, now coach of the Young Men's Institute five in
San Francisco, and Paul O'Neill, three years ago as fine a
workman as one could ask. True, O'Neill is now devoting
most of his time to law practice, but lie is still doing an
occasional job of referecing and probably could be induced
to handle important games. The same applies to Needles, j
who would probably be available any night that the Y.M.I,
was not engaging in a game.
To answer beforehand the inevitable comment this edi-j
torial will bring, the writer would like lo say that he doesn't |
know either Needles or O'Neill, and they rlo not know him.'
But the Pacific Coast Conference is too fast a loop to be j
slowed up by second-rate officiating, it deserves the best,!
and it hasn't been getting it.
