Now that King Football lias abdicated the sports throne
for another season, two points of unusual interest stand
out because of their direct connection with the season just
passed.
One of these matters is the acute and widespread agita
tion for revision of the rules governing the game in order
to eliminate the dangers of death or permanent injury to
players. A number of deaths that reaches half a hundred
is too much of a penally to pay for the existence of any
sport.
The other point is debatable. It has to do with the
boasted superiority of western football over the eastern
brand. We take our stand willi the affirmative and call up
in support of our argument the figures amassed during the
10'il season. Of 21 inlersectional contests, 18 went to west
ern teams; two were tied; and one was an eastern victory.
That ought to be sufficient proof. Maybe the West is riding
on the crest of a wave of first-class football, but opinion
among sports circles on the Coast seems to give the home
teams fair to mediocre standing as shown by competition
among themselves.
