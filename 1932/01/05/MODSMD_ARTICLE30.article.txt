# JUST A BIG, BIG IMPROVEMENT
## 
### 
Among Ihe fine things that the holiday season just past
brought to the. campus was a nice "No Parking" zone ex
tending in front of the Daily and the I'niversity Press.
This gift, which, for the nonce, we will call Shrewd Move
Number .">2, Series B, means that members of the Daily
slafl' and I'niversity Press can pafk their cars anywhere,
but within fifty feet of their respective buildings.
The Daily does not know who is responsible for this
constructive step. It hopes, however, that the man behind
the gun had some beautiful purpose in mindâ€”something
more uplifting than the awarding to two otherwise unem
ployed gentlemen the privilege of splashing black and yel
low paint on the curbing. Hut on the face of it, the paint
slinging franchise seems to have been the sole excuse.
First meeting of the editorial staff this afternoon at 1
o'clock. This means you and you and you and you and it's
plenty important.
