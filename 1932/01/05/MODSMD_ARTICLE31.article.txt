Words should be names for things
and nothing else. Usage, however,
clothes each word with a rigid
moral character —a certain ethical
value from which it is impossible
to escape. Thus the word, "truth,"
immediately calls to mind visions
of godly halo—infinite goodness—
and highest virtue. All of which do
not necessarily follow from truth;
in fact, the opposite might easily be
true. Ever since the second grade,
it seems to have been the avowed
purpose of our teachers to impress
upon one the evil character and the
cataclysmic misfortunes attendant
to procrastination. The motto, "never
put off for tomorrow what you can
do today," has finally permeated to
the inner consciousness of the pub
lic until we find the situation where
the charge—procrastination—is very
akin to murder, drunken driving
or lewdness in gravity.
This is most unfortunate for in
most cases, postponement adds zest
to liftfcand increases happiness. Take
the matter of making a certain
date. The mere thought of making
a pleasant engagement should bring
some semblance of enjoyment. The
date, itself, however, can rarely
equal rumor or expectation; and
even a desirable evening is soon
over. But procrastinate and every
time you are planning to make the
call, the mental stimulation is re
pealed. The end pleasure of the
date is not diminished and added
to it, at no extra effort or cost, is
the enjoyment of thinking about
what is to happen on several dif
ferent occasions.
A similar situation is met in post
poning unpleasant obligations. The

PROCRASTINATION—A VIRTUE, NOT A VICE

pending nuisance, when handled
the first time it shows its ugly head,
is speedily dispatched. What is ihe
result? Another problem then comes
into view—a problem that was com
pletely hidden from view by the
original difficulty. If its solution
had been postponed, the poor indi
vidual wovtld have been spared an
other problem. The person who is
continually writing term papers the
moment they are announced is in a
perpetual sweat; while the student
who writes them all in the hist
week, has only seven days of un
plcasantries. The condensing of all
the work in one week does not
lead to more bitter effort; it. results,
rather, in less work.
Then also, diversion with doom
impending is more enjoyable than
justified diversion. To waste three
days during a vacation on some
worthless purpose is not an exceed
ingly happy sport. To spend a week
end in San Francisco with a half
dozen term papers due, three mid
terms in the offing, and five hun
dred pages of outside reading on
the debit side of the books is a rare
delight. The feeling of guilt adds
spice to every dance and every act.
The five-cent cigar behind the barn
(which should be amended, behind
the garage) is sweeter than ihe
parlor Havana super-special. Pro
crastination can change every par
lor pleasure to a behind-the-garage
activity.
Pleasure demands procrastination.
Accomplishment derides it. We
have been planning to write this
article for about three months.
