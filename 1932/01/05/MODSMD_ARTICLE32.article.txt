DELICIOUS—At the Fox Stanford. |
Janet Gaynor attempts a Scotch ;
I accent which is quite unconvincing, |
while Charles Farrell, in the opposite
role, appears as a millionaire poloist
who becomes enraptured with the
1 demure Janet as she is about to j
| enter America as an immigrant.
The production is reminiscent of j
the early talkies with theme songs .
; and such tripe dragged in at every I
opportunity. This, and a flimsy plot, ,
' make the show quite the antithesis j
i of the title—unless you persist in
, being a rabid devotee of Miss Gay- !
| nor in spite of it all.
El Brendel is up to par, and there |
j is a Russian act that is good.—B.M.

i A. A. Milne's whimsical style has
1 always delighted readers in his books
1 of children's poetry and tales, and ;
his dramatic ability has been ac
claimed as the result of many plays,
but this is the first time he has tried
: his hand at a real novel. j
j The result unfortunately is not .
, entirely successful. The plot is good,
; but too slim for the length of the
work, and his whimsical style has |
| played him false for once. Whimsy
i is the most excellent literary medi
i cine in the world when applied in
| small doses, but spread thickly over !

1300 pages or so it begins to pall.
; It takes far more than that to hold
! a book together.
The theme of the book seems to
: be that human relations cannot be
1 perfect at the best, so why not make
| the best of it? We found ourselves
j trying to make the best of the book
I toward the end.
Milne is a marvel in his field, but
I it seems that he has stepped out of
| it in this venture.
