# The 						Windjammer
## 
### 
Whether you like it or not, you
losels, Windjammer is going to tell
you what happened in his neck of
the woods during the jolly Christ
mas holidays. Remember, you all
stuck your beagles out for it when
you registered in this high institu
tion and incidentally subscribed to
this sheet, and the windjammer, its
own life blood.
Fate took us by the hand and led
us through miles and miles of snowy
and icy road on the way home, but
she sure slapped our wrist when
she chiseled us into a Swedish
Christmas dinner. Now this isn't
anything against the Swedes, under
stand, because we personally don't
think that this lutefisk was fixed
right, or something, and probably
other Swedish Christmas dinners are
O. K. But if you ever want to keep
Windjammer the Wolf from your
door just write "lutefisk" there in
large letters. Or even little, teeny,
weeny letters. We'll see it, never
fear.
Maybe you don't know what lute
fisk is. Neither did we till we talked
to a Norwegian fishmonger yester
day. We found that it is sometimes
called torsk, or cusk, or tusk, and
that it's real scientific name is
brosme brosme. hTe' American ver
sion is lota maculosa, and some
times goes by the name of ling, or
eelpout. It has small barbels on its
nose, and a big barbel under its
chin. Whij rebinds.uz thad the bar
bie zeazon is dow on.)
The Norwegian fishmonger said
the lutefisk is really a great delicacy
when it is fixed right, ft seems that
they catch the little brosme brosmes
over there at Copenhagen or some
where and dry them up to mere
shadows, mere husks. Then they
send them here and the clever mar
ketmen sweat them or something
and make them swell up and be
practically as good as ever. But we
think our lutefisks were sweated a
bit too much. They had mustard
there to season with, and we used
almost all the jarful—mixed it all
in—but still the torsk taste tri
umphed. When they took out the
main dish to get it refilled, we had
the meal timed so well that we were
able to pass up our plate for more
potatoes without having more cusk.
But the gentle host insisted (the
dear) on waiting till the fish came
back. So we had two helpings.
But that isn't so bad—a lifetime
and only two helpings of lutefisk.
We had some burgoo once that was
worse, too.
Now keep your spirits up, you
flaneurs, because tomorrow Windy
Jammy is going to tell you all some
more about his Xmas. Just try and
get away!
