' dent Y.M.C.A. conference at Asilo
'jiiar last week, at which were sev- j
fjral Stanford men.
Among the Stanford delegation, ;
1 the smallest in years, were Seldon i
1 \)sborne, Ben Hope, Ronald Chinn, |
(Ben Evans, Br. David Gardner, and |
the Bev. I!. H. Silverthorn. The!

I 'Grove.
j i "Men to Match Our Times" was 1
i the theme of the conference, and \
leaders expressed hope that they j
had aroused in each student a
jjfgreater enthusiasm and wider un- j
. derstanding of the great public and j
■ problems which confront

■ \;how how the principles of Christ j
j should be applied to -these prob
lems.
''The present economic order is i
, 'not Christian, but anti-Christ!"' de
clared Stitt-Wilson. He is used to i
speaking to crowds on street-cor- i
ners, as well as to service clubs and j

| college audiences, on behalf of so
i cialism.
Every profession crowded to ca
pacity, more white collar men being
! forced to walk the streets every
day, are conditions which offer no
i college student, whatever his train- |
I ing, any cause reasonably to expect !
j employment, he explained. And his j
j solution is to organize the means
of production for the public good, j
i in place of the present chaos of con
j flicting private interests.
I Dr. Popenoe spoke on the sex |
development of the child, and the I
need for eugenic sterilization, and I
| discussed other problems with
I which the Institute of Family Re
| lations is concerned.
Dr. O. W. Cook, of the University j
1 of Southern California, spoke on the |
coming disarmament conference, j
and urged students to arouse the |
: public in insisting that their diplo- j
mats co-operate in reducing war j
j preparations.

| led two-hour seminars each morn- j
i ing on such subjects as "Personal |
Problems," "Problems of Belief, |
| "Economics and Industry," "Inter

j "The Personality of Jesus."
