# ALLEN TO CONTINUE WITH BACH RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or-
I ganist, will continue with his pro- |
| gram of compositions selected from '
i the "Little Organ Book" by Bach in
: his organ recital this afternoon at j
| 5:30 o'clock in the Memorial Church. |
i There are several rather interest- j
j ing Chorale-preludes in today's pro- '
! gram. "O Lamb of God, All Holy" j
! contains many slurred figures which j
. aim to depict sobbing and trembling !
! caused by the cruxification of Christ. !
I "O Lamb of God, Our Savior" is an- I
| other of especial interest. Although j
i it is one of the shortest of the series,
I it is one of the most poignant. Mem
| bers of the University Choir will aid
I Allen in presenting these programs,
| which will consist of the following
! pieces:
O Lamb of God, All Holy
O Lamb of God, Our Savior
See the Lord of Life and Light
When on the Cross the Savior
Hung
O Man, Thy Grievous Sin Bemoan
Trio-Sonata, No. 4, in E Minor
We Bless Thee, Jesus Christ Our
Lord
Help, God, The Former of All
Things
Resolved: "That It is Better to Be j
Drunk than to Be in Love" was de- j
I bated recently at McGill.
