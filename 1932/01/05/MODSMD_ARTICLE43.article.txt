Much water has trickled unde
the bridge since ihe Daily last pro
vided interest for a dull 8 o'clock.
In the first place, the curtain ha:
at last been rung down on the pro
tracted grid season, and basketbal
is already off to a flying start.
lJv squelching the South,
trouncing Georgia (it) to 0, and
stopping the march of Tulane,
21 to 12, the Trojans of South
ern California annexed an un
disputed claim to the mythical
national championship, despite
their early season loss to the
Gaels of St. Mary's.
After that first upset, when thi
better prepared Moragans dumpec
the "Trojans, there was no stopping
the Howard Jones clan. Notre Dame
and Tulane came the closest to do
ing it, with the latter giving their
their toughest battle of the season
if you believe the Los Angeles
sports writers.
With St. Mary's collapsing in mid
season and Stanford coming through
with a great victory over Dart
mouth to show the East had nothing
to offer, there was no denying tht
"championship" hinged on the Tu
lane-U.S.C. Rose Bow! encounter.
With both California and
Southern California occupied
with post-season games, the
West was deprived of some of
its most outstanding players in
the Shrine classic at Kezar New
Year's Day, and took one on the
chin, (i to 0, at the hands of a
powerful Eastern aggregation
gathered from the more numer
ous institutions east of the Mis
sissippi.
For once, intersectional games
with the South showed a real ad
vantage to the West. Washington
Stale's loss to Tulane was the only
one of the season to a Southern
team, while Western victories in
cluded those of St. Mary's over
Southern Methodist, Santa Clara
over Loyola (of New Orleans), Cali
fornia over Georgia Tech, and
Southern California over Georgia
and Tulane.
Another echo of football sea
son was the presentation of the
Pop Warner award to Phil Mof
l'att. Moffatt didn't see much
action this season, but there is
no questioning his value to
Stanford football during his
career here.
The Christmas season also saw
Ihe guiding lights of the San Fran
cisco Seals pick a new manager.
Jimmy Caveney was chosen to fill
the post left vacant by the strange
ousting of the popular Nick Wil
liams.
Caveney first played for the
Seals in when he was pur
chased for a mere Si,ooo from
Columbus. Two years later he
was sold to the Cincinnati Reds
for S«S5,()00. which the Graduate
School of Business would admit
was a fair return on the in
vestment.
He returned to the coast in 1925,
playing for Seattle and the Oaks
before being released to the Seals.

After that first upset, when thi

the "Trojans, there was no stopping
the Howard Jones clan. Notre Dame

With St. Mary's collapsing in mid
