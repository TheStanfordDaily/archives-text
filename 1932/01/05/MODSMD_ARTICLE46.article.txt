# Practice Games Whip Card Quintet Into Shape
## VACATION MEETS HELP COACH BUNN ORGANIZE CAGERS Preliminary Contests Used For Trying Out All Material Early 
### Jack Jernegan 
_ | Six vacation games, experimental
,i and practice games in the true
i i sense of the words, have gone into
s | the making of the Stanford basket
| ball five that returning students
_ | saw last night against Santa Clara,
h i Winning the first, losing three in
_ | a row, then winning again, the In
-0 j dian cagers have put in an uncer
e I tain two weeks in the process of
_ ! finding their stride, but Coach John
! Bunn has put in a very profitable
i two weeks in the process of build-
I ing his team.
Three Wins
The results that will go down in j
j the score books read as follows:
i Stanford 24, San Jose 21
St. Mary's 38, Stanford 24
Olympic Club 28, Stanford 22
Pittsburgh 22, Stanford 11
I Stanford 45, Oregon State H2
Stanford 27, U.S.F. 2(i
But the results that are princi- !
! pally of interest to Cardinal sup- I
s I porters consist of a well organized !

Bunn Satisfied
v | "The season so far has been en- i
i ! tirely experimental. I scheduled all j
- j of my practice games early in the j
1 | season with the intention of using I
i! them to try out all of the material j
J before the conference games, and
I the idea has worked out perfectly." j
! This is Coach Bunn's view of the ,
I n
j hrst six games.
As the result of his experiment - J
| ing, sometimes at the expense of j
' winning games, Bunn has settled !
i upon his forwards and center and I
j has made a good start on the guard
j positions. In Cordry, Lacombe,
j Packard, Norgard, and Baker or
r i Schnetka, he has apparently found j
| a combination that is strong both j
I offensively and defensively under
j 1 fire.
5 I Lacombe, Cordry Good
. 1 Frenchy Lacombe couldn't locate ;
j the basket with a telescope in the |
j first four games of the season, but j
! he came through like a real star in
| the University of San Francisco and ■
1 Oregon State games, taking high- j
! point honors in both contests.
Tom Cordry has returned to the j
' effectively aggressive style of floor- j
j work that made him a regular last 1
j year, while his shooting is improv
| ing with every game. Both he and
3 j Lacombe stand head and shoulders 1
I above their competitors.
Packard Capable
At center Dave Packard is in a
I similar position, although his play
, ; still has a good many rough spots,
j , As pivot man of the attack Packard
j carries a heavy responsibility, but j
' he has proven himself fully capable I
' I of handling the job.
I With a total of six good men
! fighting for the two positions, the ,
| guard situation is uncertain, despite I
j the fact that Schnetka and Norgard j
I stood out in the Oregon and San (
j Francisco games. Tod, Baker, Rin- !
j tala, and Edelen ai - e all virtually on '
! a par with each other and with the j
; Schnetka-Norgard pair.
The vacation games themselves
well divided into two distinct sec
tions, Ihe first four being charac
terized by the total inability of any
Stanford man to make baskets, and
11k last two by an abrupt recovery
from this weakness.
San Jose State fell by the usual
moderate core in the opening game
ot the year. The contest was chiefly
ftuituK d by an unending procession
of Stanford substitutes as Bunn
sent in four complete teams, one for
every 10 minutes of piay.
Much stronger than last year, St.
Marys got n v'enjj." for its one-sided
defeat of Iby walking away from
a miscel' ;neovs collection of Indian
lineups in the second tilt. Stanford's
decisive beating was largely ac
counted for by a lad named Cavi
gilia who ran up 21 points in a
sensational shooting spree.
Going up to Kczar Pavilion for a
double-header with the Olympic
Club the day after Christmas, the
Cardinal first team went down with
only mild resistance, while the sec
ond team lost to the Winged "O"
seconds by a 45-25 score. A last
minute rally, led by Bill Doub and
Rudy Rintala, was all that saved
the first five from being more de
cisively downed.
Every man on the squad saw ac
tion in one or the other of the two
club contests.
Panthers Champions
Pittsburgh's barnstorming team,
champions of the East, visited ihe
Farm December 29. and found the
Indians at their worst. Stanford
made only two field goals during
the entire evening, while the Pan
thers played a "slow-but-sure" game
to win handily. Even in this tilt the
Redshirts had more shots at the
basket than their onponenLs.
Il remained for Oregon State's
unlucky Beavers to feci the real
potential ability of Burin's aggrega
tion. The starting five, LaCombe,
Cordry, Packard, Norpard, and
Schnetka, clicked with a vengeance
; nd ran away from the visitors. The
Indians ran up eight points in ten
minutes before the Beavers made
t!:eir first field •. oal. In this game
I aCombe tallied 21 points, and
Packard w. s l ight on his heels with
15.

San Jose State fell by the usual

sensational shooting spree.
Going up to Kczar Pavilion for a

Cardinal first team went down with
