# Practice Games Whip Card Quintet Into Shape
## VACATION MEETS HELP COACH BUNN ORGANIZE CAGERS Preliminary Contests Used For Trying Out All Material Early 
### Jack Jernegan 
_ | Six vacation games, experimental
,i and practice games in the true
i i sense of the words, have gone into
s | the making of the Stanford basket
| ball five that returning students
_ | saw last night against Santa Clara,
h i Winning the first, losing three in
_ | a row, then winning again, the In
-0 j dian cagers have put in an uncer
e I tain two weeks in the process of
_ ! finding their stride, but Coach John
! Bunn has put in a very profitable
i two weeks in the process of build-
I ing his team.
Three Wins
The results that will go down in j
j the score books read as follows:
i Stanford 24, San Jose 21
St. Mary's 38, Stanford 24
Olympic Club 28, Stanford 22
Pittsburgh 22, Stanford 11
I Stanford 45, Oregon State H2
Stanford 27, U.S.F. 2(i
But the results that are princi- !
! pally of interest to Cardinal sup- I
s I porters consist of a well organized !
. ! and fairly definite quintet of fast !
1 ' moving basketball players who look ;
j as though they were going places j
} j this year.
Bunn Satisfied
v | "The season so far has been en- i
i ! tirely experimental. I scheduled all j
- j of my practice games early in the j
1 | season with the intention of using I
i! them to try out all of the material j
J before the conference games, and
I the idea has worked out perfectly." j
! This is Coach Bunn's view of the ,
I n
j hrst six games.
As the result of his experiment - J
| ing, sometimes at the expense of j
' winning games, Bunn has settled !
i upon his forwards and center and I
j has made a good start on the guard
j positions. In Cordry, Lacombe,
j Packard, Norgard, and Baker or
r i Schnetka, he has apparently found j
| a combination that is strong both j
I offensively and defensively under
j 1 fire.
5 I Lacombe, Cordry Good
. 1 Frenchy Lacombe couldn't locate ;
j the basket with a telescope in the |
j first four games of the season, but j
! he came through like a real star in
| the University of San Francisco and ■
1 Oregon State games, taking high- j
! point honors in both contests.
Tom Cordry has returned to the j
' effectively aggressive style of floor- j
j work that made him a regular last 1
j year, while his shooting is improv
| ing with every game. Both he and
3 j Lacombe stand head and shoulders 1
I above their competitors.
Packard Capable
At center Dave Packard is in a
I similar position, although his play
, ; still has a good many rough spots,
j , As pivot man of the attack Packard
j carries a heavy responsibility, but j
' he has proven himself fully capable I
' I of handling the job.
I With a total of six good men
! fighting for the two positions, the ,
| guard situation is uncertain, despite I
j the fact that Schnetka and Norgard j
I stood out in the Oregon and San (
j Francisco games. Tod, Baker, Rin- !
j tala, and Edelen ai - e all virtually on '
! a par with each other and with the j
; Schnetka-Norgard pair.
