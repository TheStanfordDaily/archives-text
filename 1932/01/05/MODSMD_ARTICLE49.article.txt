sault upon a white woman Satur- ,
day, the slaying of a Filipino by a !
traffic officer last night and the con- j
tinued ftunt today for an escaped ,
murderer by city and territorial po- j
lice caused much excitement here. 1
These events, three weeks after i
disorders in Honolulu streets con
sequent upon the disagreement of !
a jury which tried five men charged
with assaulting a naval officer's wife, ;
impelled Governor Lawrence M. j
' Judd to call the territorial police to
the assistance of Honolulu peace of- j
ficers. He appointed Major Gordon
C. Ross of the National Guard to
take charge of policing Oahu island.
