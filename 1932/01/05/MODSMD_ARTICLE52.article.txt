# THORNTON SAYS STANFORD HAS CHANCE TO WIN INTERCOLLEGIATE SWIM MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's chance;, in the national
intercollegiate swimming meet, which
rolls around next March, are con
sidered excellent by Assistant Coach
Norton Thornton. A well-rounded
team is the big talking point for this
year's Cardinal representation, since
the two major competitors Michi
gan and Navy—owe most of their
strength to the abilities of one out
standing star each.
In Thornton's opinion, "If the au
thorities see fit to send this team to
the national intercollegiate meet at
Annapolis, Stanford has an excellent
chance of winning. We have tre
mendous strength in the 50, 100, 220,
440, backstroke, and relay." As proof
of this, it will be remembered that
John McKelvey unofficially broke
both the national intercollegiate 40-
yard and 50-yard records last quar
ter, and Gardner came through with
*n almost similar performance. Mc-
Kelvey also came 'within .seven
tenths of a second of the 100-yard
mark.
One of the strongest bidders for
honors will be Austin Clapp, present
national intercollegiate champion in j

i I the 220. Last year he came within
i inches of nosing out Buster Crabbe,
■ of U.S.C., in the 440. Crabbe has
i graduated. Ted Wiget, sophomoifc
I star, is right up with Clapp in both
distances. ,
| All events except the relay are
; scored on the 5, !5, 2, 1 basis, and
with the Indians standing an t xt
cellent chance of sweeping first and
j second places in both the 220 and
. , 440, there would be chalked up I<\
i points as a starter. And no team h. <
j ever scored higher than 19 pointy
j in a national intercollegiate meet!
Summing up the team, its main
j virtue is its versatility.
, with the other college tank outfits'*
! ihe Indians are wonderfully wellr
j rounded—a quality which does more,
i possibly, than anything else to maki?
; possible a prediction so promising

Stanford's chance;, in the national
intercollegiate swimming meet, which
rolls around next March, are con
sidered excellent by Assistant Coach
Norton Thornton. A well-rounded
team is the big talking point for this
year's Cardinal representation, since
the two major competitors Michi
gan and Navy—owe most of their
strength to the abilities of one out
standing star each.
In Thornton's opinion, "If the au
thorities see fit to send this team to
the national intercollegiate meet at
Annapolis, Stanford has an excellent
chance of winning. We have tre
mendous strength in the 50, 100, 220,
440, backstroke, and relay." As proof
of this, it will be remembered that
John McKelvey unofficially broke
both the national intercollegiate 40-
yard and 50-yard records last quar
ter, and Gardner came through with
*n almost similar performance. Mc-
Kelvey also came 'within .seven
tenths of a second of the 100-yard
mark.
One of the strongest bidders for
honors will be Austin Clapp, present
national intercollegiate champion in j

i I the 220. Last year he came within
i inches of nosing out Buster Crabbe,
■ of U.S.C., in the 440. Crabbe has
i graduated. Ted Wiget, sophomoifc

distances. ,
