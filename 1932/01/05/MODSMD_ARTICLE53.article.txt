# UNTRIED FROSH TO MEET PALO ALTO CAGERS ON FRIDAY
## Team Handicapped by Lack Of Height, Weight; Guards Adequate 
### 
Uncertain as to strength and
lineup, Stanford's lroshman basket
ball team will play its first game of
the season Friday afternoon against
Palo Alto high school. Contrary to
custom, the stalwarts of the class *<1
'35 did not practice during Christ
mas vacation, and the first real
workout of tlif squad was held yes
terday afternoon.
The chances of a strong frosh
quintet were considerably dimmed
when it was learned that neither
Bob Moore nor Rod Bust would play
this season. Moore is the all-state
guard who proved himself as adept
at football as he is reputed to be at
basketball when he si; tied consis
tently on the Ire: hman football team.
Bost, who was out lot basketball
last fall was eon. iderod by Coach
Vance FawceLi to be t! < best of the
forward prospects.
(.(Kid (ill,; a Prospects
The news of the loss of Moore
and Bost was offset in part at least
by the appearance yesterday altcr
rioon of a new freshman cage star
named M: Uatratt. The gentleman
with the imposing name was an all
city guard at Galileo, and his pres
ence will materially help Fawcett's
hopefuls.
Other guard candidates include
Dud Saies, VVa Iy Crowe, Frank Cox,
and Warren Br.dey. Sales has an
advantage due to his height, but at
present the quartette ranks about
evenly. A1 Page and the Coiner
twins seem to have whatever edge
exists toward earning a regular for
ward berth, and Kelley, Griswold,
and Bill Smith are outstanding
among the centers.
Team Lacks Height
According to Fawcett, the team is
going to be handicapped by lack of
height. Sales, Kelley, and Griswold
are the only tall men on the squad,
and most i i the 1 esi of the players
earned their hir.h school reputations
on weight teams.
The team plays Pittsburg high
school Saturday afternoon, and then
embarks on a regular schedule that
culminates in the little Big Series
against California.

and Warren Br.dey. Sales has an
advantage due to his height, but at
present the quartette ranks about
evenly. A1 Page and the Coiner
twins seem to have whatever edge
exists toward earning a regular for
ward berth, and Kelley, Griswold,
and Bill Smith are outstanding
among the centers.
Team Lacks Height
According to Fawcett, the team is
going to be handicapped by lack of
height. Sales, Kelley, and Griswold
are the only tall men on the squad,
and most i i the 1 esi of the players
earned their hir.h school reputations
on weight teams.
The team plays Pittsburg high
school Saturday afternoon, and then
embarks on a regular schedule that
culminates in the little Big Series
against California.
