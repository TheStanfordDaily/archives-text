# WOMEN TRIPLE UP AS RECORD CROWD OVERRUNS ROBLE
## 
### 
Iloble is starting the quarter
"crowded to the roof' as Miss Anas
tasia Doyle, director, expresses it.
The 22f> girls who are rooming
there number eighteen more than
is the "capacity" of the building.
Twenty of these are girls entering
the University this quarter. This is
twice as many as are usually ad
mitted winter quarter.
The overcrowded condition is
being met by placing three in a
suite and by sending graduate stu
dents, who are not obliged to live
at Ruble as new women, to living
quarters elsewhere on the campus
or in Palo Alto.
