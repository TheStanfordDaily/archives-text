# FAST ARIZONA FOUR DOWNS STANFORD 9-7 IN ONE-SIDED GAME
## 
### 
Unable to cope with Arizona's j
j flashy offense, the Stanford polo
, team went down to defeat in its j
j game December 19, 9-7.
The Cardinal four were completely (
outclassed from the beginning. Ari- I
zona, purported to be the foremost j
i college team in the country, got off |
to a flying start and soon overcame j
the five-goal handicap given Stan- j
; ford. Lack of accuracy in the scor- j
i ing zone prevented the Redshirts!
j from adding any tallies to the five
! goals .spotted them, until a brilliant !
j rally in the final chukker added I
j two goals.
Captain Fleming and Lewis both i
I played stellar polo, the latter in ,
' spite of the handicap of a pulled i
leg tendon. The second game of the
series, to have been played Decern- |
; ber 21, was called off on account j
â€¢ of the unfavorable weather condi- j
j tions.
