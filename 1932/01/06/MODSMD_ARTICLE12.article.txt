# Drowned Pocketbook Single Catastrophe Of Lagunita Season
## 
### 
I While about three hundred indi
-1 viduals came and gazed, surprised
j at the spectacle of a wet if muddy
• Lagunita, some twenty intrepid
! couples took advantage of the of
■ ficial opening of the Stanford boat
ing season and actually canoed on
the enlarged mud puddle yesterday
morning and afternoon.
New Retriever
Although no capsizes marred the
day's enjoyment, the chill waters
of the lake were visited by one
swimmer who spent a cold half
hour searching unsuccessfully for
! a lady's purse that had been inad
j vertently dropped into the briny
! deep.
Canoeing on Lagunita may be in
! dulged in only by those who have
passed the necessary canoe tests.
These tests arc being given daily in
the Encina pool for those men who
I did not take them before the ad
| vent of the h o-year dry season on
j the campus. All successful testees
j will be allowed to canoe any time
| between 10 o'clock in the morning.
I and the same hour in the evening,
! and during that period either Frank
| Booth or A1 Throndson will be on
i duty to issue canoes as well as to
! rescue any who find the task of
i balancing an eighteen-foot shell too
i much for them.
Canoes For Rent
Most of the various organizations
on tho campus have their own
canoes, and in addition four rental
boats arc available. These latter
may be hired for 75 cents for the
first hour and 50 cents for each
succeeding hour.
The income from such rentals
goes to the Lagunita Boat fund,
j which is under the supervision of
I Ernie Brandstcn, and will be used
|to defray the expenses of hiring
; guards and keeping the canoes in
j good condition. It is possible to sign
I up in advance for these boats, and
I romantically minded individuals
will find this practice worthwhile
! as canoeing on Lagunita is especial
i ly popular in the evenings.
