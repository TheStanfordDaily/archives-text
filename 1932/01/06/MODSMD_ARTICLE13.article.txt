# FROSH OPEN HOOP SEASON WITH PALO ALTO TILT FRIDAY
## 
### 
Vance Fawcett's freshman basket
ball team is in its final week of
preparation for the opening games
against Palo Alto High and Pitts
burg High quintets on Friday and
Saturday nights.
The Palo Alto-Frosh game is
arousing much interest among Palo
Alto and peninsula fans. In 1930, the
best Indian freshman team in years
weftt down to defeat before a Palo
Alto team, with Frenchy LaCombe,
then a senior at the local high
school, as star player.
Varsity men Edelen, Cordry,
Meade, Palmer, and Hancock were
on that freshman team, hut they
were not match for the Viking five
which went on to win the North
Coast championship.
Last year an unusually weak
Red-and-Green five beat the In
dian frosh, 16-12. The game was
very slew, and was undoubtedly
Stanford's worst performance of the
year. This year "Hod" Ray has a
better quintet than in 1931, although
they made a very poor showing in
dropping a 25-7 game to Lowell,
San Francisco champions. The Vik
ings lack height, but this handicap
also exists in the freshman ranks.
Fawcett's team will be hard-pressed
to avert a third straight defeat at
the hands of the Palo Altans.
