question.
The Palo Alto Times is conduct
ing a postcard vote among the in
structors for the purpose of deter
mining the dominating attitude of
the faculty toward the transforma
j tioti of Stanford into a graduate
school.
Each instructor will be asked to

I express his attitude as either favor
able or unfavorable toward such ac
tion and to comment further if he
! so desires.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur has
| gone on record as being in favor
of the gradual elimination of the
lower division. In 1928 the registra
