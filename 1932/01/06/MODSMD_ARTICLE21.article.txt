# Saffords Excel In Presentation Of Varied Music
## Program Includes Modern And Ancient Numbers 
### 
Proving themselves sufficiently
versatile to pi-ovide a program of
varied selection and instrumental
arrangement, Laura Tappen SafTord,
contralto and 'cellist, and Charles
L. Safford, baritone and pianist, en
tertained a large audience in the
Assembly flail last evening. The
program was made up of composi
tions taken from the seventeenth
century to the present, representing
many countries and arranged to dis
play the double accomplishments of
the performers.
Lyrics Rendered
Mrs. Safford won the enthusiastic
approval of the audience with her
delightful interpretation of lyrics by
Respig'ni, Brahms, Strauss, and
those of her husband—"Found" and
"The Flame." This group of songs
was arranged to show the wide
range of the artist's dramatic abil
ity. She displayed a fine contrast
of feeling between the plaintive
"Wanderers Nacht-Lied" and the
buoyant "Wir Wandelten," Brahms.
The .singer encored this croup with
"Lullaby and Goodnight," also
Brahms, and found this selection to
be the most popular of the pro
gram.
"Found" is a song which Safford
completed only two weeks ago. He
composed music for a poem which
appeared in a recent issue of a well
known magazine. This sprightly
piece had a great deal of sparkle,
indicating Safford's ability as a
composer in addition to his skill
with organ, voice, and piano.
Wagner Presented
"Shall I in Mam re's Fertile Plain,"
Handel, and "The Evening Star"
(Tannhauser), Wagner, were pre
sented with SafTord singing and ac
companying himself and his wife
playing the 'cello. These two num
bers were executed in excellent co
ordination- and with a great deal of
feeling.
SafTord, who is head of the de
partment of music at Williams Col
lege, Massachusetts, will take War
ren D. Allen's place temporarily as
University organist, when the latter
leaves early in February. Mrs. Saf
ford will give voice and 'cello les
sons during their stay at Stanford.
Next Tuesday evening the SafTords
will give musical illustrations for a
lecture on Wagner at the University
of California.

be the most popular of the pro
gram.
"Found" is a song which Safford
completed only two weeks ago. He
composed music for a poem which
appeared in a recent issue of a well
known magazine. This sprightly
piece had a great deal of sparkle,
indicating Safford's ability as a
composer in addition to his skill
with organ, voice, and piano.
Wagner Presented
"Shall I in Mam re's Fertile Plain,"
Handel, and "The Evening Star"
(Tannhauser), Wagner, were pre
sented with SafTord singing and ac
companying himself and his wife
playing the 'cello. These two num
bers were executed in excellent co
ordination- and with a great deal of
feeling.
SafTord, who is head of the de
partment of music at Williams Col
lege, Massachusetts, will take War
ren D. Allen's place temporarily as
University organist, when the latter
leaves early in February. Mrs. Saf
ford will give voice and 'cello les
sons during their stay at Stanford.
Next Tuesday evening the SafTords
will give musical illustrations for a
lecture on Wagner at the University
of California.
Proving themselves sufficiently
versatile to pi-ovide a program of
varied selection and instrumental
arrangement, Laura Tappen SafTord,
contralto and 'cellist, and Charles
L. Safford, baritone and pianist, en
tertained a large audience in the
Assembly flail last evening. The
program was made up of composi
tions taken from the seventeenth
century to the present, representing
many countries and arranged to dis
play the double accomplishments of
the performers.
Lyrics Rendered
Mrs. Safford won the enthusiastic
approval of the audience with her
delightful interpretation of lyrics by
Respig'ni, Brahms, Strauss, and
those of her husband—"Found" and
"The Flame." This group of songs
was arranged to show the wide
range of the artist's dramatic abil
ity. She displayed a fine contrast
of feeling between the plaintive
"Wanderers Nacht-Lied" and the
buoyant "Wir Wandelten," Brahms.
The .singer encored this croup with
"Lullaby and Goodnight," also
Brahms, and found this selection to
be the most popular of the pro
gram.
