Attractive room, and room and

according to Mrs. Irene Spenner,
head of the Appointment Office.
Five hours work a week is gen
erally asked for rooms, and a cor
responding amount for board and
room. Several attractive openings
have come in during the week, but
were immediately taken up. Stu
dents wishing employment should
keep in touch with the Appointment
Office, and all those who do not
have employment blanks on file,
should fill these out immediately.
Textbooks may be borrowed with
out charge from the Appointment
Office by self-supporting students.
