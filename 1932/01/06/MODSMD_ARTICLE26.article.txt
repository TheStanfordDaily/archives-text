A careless skunk and a care

make the regular Registration
Dance a sensuous success Mon

when compared to the nose
tickling activity of the striped
kitty.
Just how the polecat found
its way into Branner Hall is
still an unsolved mystery, but
the hundred or so couples who
decided to sit out one particu
larly appealing number can
attest to the undoubted pres
ence of the animal.
