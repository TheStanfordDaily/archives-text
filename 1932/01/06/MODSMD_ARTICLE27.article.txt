# Y.W. SECRETARY SPEAKS TONIGHT
## Talks Given At Clubhouse And Cabinet Supper 
### 
Miss Maude Russell, active secre
tary of the American Y.W.C.A. in
China since 1917, will give a review
of "Twenty Years of the Republic
in China" tonight in a lecture which
will begin at 7:30 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse. All students
are invited.
With a mastery of the events in
present-day China and the swiftly
moving political changes possessed
by few contemporaries, Miss Rus
sell has an intimate knowledge of
the customs of the Chinese people.
This she has acquired by more than
fifteen years spent in social service
work in connection with young Chi
nese girls and older women. Her
success in this role has been such
that she is better known there as
the "Laughing Foreigner."
An alumna of the University of
California, Miss Russell speaks Chi
nese fluently and writes with simi
lar ease. Due to this exceptional
ability in a foreigner, the social
service worker is a member of the
small European-American group
which is privileged to work under
the direction of the Chinese boards
and staff.
The lecture will be followed by
an informal meeting and discus
sion for which the speaker will re
main.
Miss Russell is to be the guest
and informal speaker at the Cabinet
supper meeting of the Y.W.C.A. to
night at. 5:45 o'clock in the "Y"
rooms. The regular meeting will
consist of reports of the "Y" activi
ties on the campus.
