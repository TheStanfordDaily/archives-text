# WITHOUT HONOR?
## 
### 
In an adjoining column, Leonard Bloom, varsity de
baler, looks askance* at Stanford's Honor ('.ode and brands
it useless and unenforceable. Honor, be savs, is a moral
attribute, and to punish violators of a trust is to deny the
existence of a code.
There is nothing new in what Bloom sets forth. JI is
letter serves merely to raise again the old issues. Is it pos
sible to have an "honor" code that has as its foundation a
system of individual police work?
The Daily has refrained, for the past three months,
from discussing the Honor ('.ode, its strength and weakness,
principally because the five members of the present Men's
Cemneil seem to be honestly concerned with the problem of
educating Stanford students in the matter of the Code.
These Council members have assembled the freshmen in
si nail groups and outlined to them the principles on which
the Code operates. It is a little too early to determine the
results, if any, ol' these informal discussions; suflice to say
that the Council has dealt summarily with those violators
brought before it in iiie quarter just past. But whether the
number of actual violations is smaller than before, or
whether the students are still reticent about turning in
former, is a matter open for debate.
To Bloom, the Daily can say only, "Wail a little while.
Let us see whether the Men's Council's work has had any
effect."
