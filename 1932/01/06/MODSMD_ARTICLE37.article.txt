# HEALTH IS IMPORTANT

### 
Among other things of great importance to students is
the matter of health.
('olds and related illnesses took a heavy toll from the
ranks of Stanford students during the quarter just passed,
cutting down the efficiency of individuals, causing others to
miss classes and quizzes, and generally detracting from
stutlenl abiiitv.
It should be unnecessary to call attention to the neces
sity for regular habits of living and immediate care to pre
vent the spreael and development of colds into serious
cases.-In addition to individual inconvenience and danger,
there is the eVcr-prescnt menace to others. It is not too
much to ask that every person in the Stanford community
take steps to protect himself as well as his neighbors.
