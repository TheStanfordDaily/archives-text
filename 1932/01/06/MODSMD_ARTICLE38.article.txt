# BE NOT DOWNHEARTED

While every rough is rejoicing at tlic prospect of many
hours spent in cruising the waters of Lagunita, the fact that
it is full is of more far-reaching significance than the mere
pleasure that it affords.
For a period of nearly ten years, rainfall in California
has been of decreasing trend, with subsequent lowering of
water tables, crop failures, and even acute shortages of wa
ter for domestic purposes. In agricultural regions, ex
penditures of tremendous sums for irrigation have added
to the costs of production, which coupled with depression
has cut profits and made for lower standards of living.
Unavoidably this depressed condition is reflected i,n all
other lines of business, especially since agriculture is a
basic industry in this state.
Coming as if did at the Christmas season, the new life
giving supply of water is a present for which every person
can be thankful individually and collectivelv.
