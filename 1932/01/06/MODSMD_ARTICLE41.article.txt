# BULL SESSION
## CONTRACT AND THE PRESS 
### 
Just when people who thought
that newspapers were places to
print news were getting used to
seeing football, movio stars, and
murders splattered all over Ihe
paper—the Bridge Battle of the
Century broke loose with a fury
that seems to know no end. What
started out to be a publicity-spread
for Culbertson and Lenz has finally
carved for itself a permanent place
on the front page of the nation's
press. Day after day, the agonizing
details of 150 rubbers of bridge have
been described with minute care by
star reporters, special correspond
ents, stories written by the partici
pants, and photographs by the
camera-men.
Now we enjoy the game of bridge
immensely. We state without blush
ing that we have lasted in sessions
until the smoke became so thick the
hearts looked like clubs and the
snoring of the exhausted kibitzers
drowned out the loudest bids. That
does not indicate, however, that
every time we pick up a paper, we
want to see the charges, counter
charges, excuses, and counter
excuses of two men anxious to sell
books smeared over the front page.
Lenz may be a normal person; evi
dence is lacking. Culbertson is defi
nitely insane. He has stated that
there is as much beauty in a per
fectly conceived and a perfectly
played no-trump grand slam as in
a Gothic cathedral.
The only argument advanced in
favor of feeding the public 'this
bridge tripe is that the public wants
to be fed. That is no argument; it
is merely an .excuse. The news
papers have a moral duty to attempt
to educate the public laste rather

[ (han bowing down and kissing the
i hem of the people's skirt. If the
i only test for front page material is
I to be the interest of the people, then
the newspapers today are in a very
! sad state, indeed. In the first place,
all international news should never
; reach page one. The only kind of
foreign affairs that the majority
I care aboue is the fight of the movie
; colony to support titled husbands.
! National politics in general is of
J little greater interest.
If the front page is to mirror the
public's taste, then the "Life and
Loves of Clara Bow," with photo
graphs and affidavits accompanying,
should start at once. Stories of
young gills who go to Hollywood
should also be featured. Divorces,
love triangles, gruesome murders,
and sporting events should also re
ceive consistent front page atten
tion. The only difficulty is that
while Congress can manufacture
news day after day without any in
dication of fatigue or depletion, the
other sources indicated above are
not so fruitful. This can only be
oversome by the press associations
making contracts with the stars to
produce a certain number of di
vorces, escapades, and marriages per
year. This will insure a consistent
news supply.
Two days of two-column, fine
print editorials by Greeley may
have represented one extreme; a
worse extreme is \ the continued
bridge drivel between the Leitz 1,
2, 3 hop-skip-jump system and the
Culbertson try-and-force-the-ap
proach method. Anyway, let us be
thankful that the poker marathon
died in the papers after a few days.
There is hope. —Abe Mellinkoff.

Just when people who thought
that newspapers were places to
print news were getting used to
seeing football, movio stars, and
murders splattered all over Ihe
paper—the Bridge Battle of the
Century broke loose with a fury
that seems to know no end. What
started out to be a publicity-spread
for Culbertson and Lenz has finally
carved for itself a permanent place
on the front page of the nation's
press. Day after day, the agonizing
details of 150 rubbers of bridge have
been described with minute care by
star reporters, special correspond
ents, stories written by the partici
pants, and photographs by the
camera-men.
Now we enjoy the game of bridge
immensely. We state without blush
ing that we have lasted in sessions
until the smoke became so thick the
hearts looked like clubs and the
snoring of the exhausted kibitzers
drowned out the loudest bids. That
does not indicate, however, that
every time we pick up a paper, we
want to see the charges, counter
charges, excuses, and counter
excuses of two men anxious to sell
books smeared over the front page.
Lenz may be a normal person; evi
dence is lacking. Culbertson is defi
nitely insane. He has stated that
there is as much beauty in a per
fectly conceived and a perfectly
played no-trump grand slam as in
a Gothic cathedral.
The only argument advanced in
favor of feeding the public 'this
bridge tripe is that the public wants
to be fed. That is no argument; it
is merely an .excuse. The news
papers have a moral duty to attempt
to educate the public laste rather
