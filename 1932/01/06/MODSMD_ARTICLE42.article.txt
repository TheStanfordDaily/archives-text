# The 						WINDJAMMER

### 
A glance around favorite nooks
and crannies of the old stamping
ground is as depressing as an eve
ning spent watching "Frankenstein.''
Put Old Man Depression in the
role of the monster, and turn him
loose among the ranks, and you'll
know fairly accurately what's hap
pened to a lot of your pals.
Pretty soon we'll he having
Women's Rushing to worry
about, with ail its complica
tions—and the lovely Greek
maidens will haul out the best
chinaware, and remember that
their pals in Deke and Beta and
Sigma Nu and Ad Infinitum
houses aren't such bad eggs
after all—at least they have
some pretty cute little freshman
sisters—and "Could we borrow
a dozen of your least-scratched
chairs for a couple of weeks?"
Pleasant surprise, isn't it, to sud
denly look up and find yourself a
popular man-of-the-hour, and even
a knight on wheels (if you have a
car that sports anything over 3%
cylinders)? We could mention more
than one sweet little innocent Roble
gal who's been persuaded on an
all-afternoon drive through the
foothills that although an ARROW
points up toward the farthest end of
the Row, you're safer when you
KAPPA da' climax by getting locked
up behind a KEY.
You'll all be pretty well
pleased to learn that out of a
hazy nothingness we've sudden
ly acquired a basketball team.
Just about broke the boys' hearts
to stay here all during the holi
days, to live on training rations
while the rest of the world grew
portly with turkey and pudding

—so they've started in to do
some breaking on their own ac
count. They even put the ball
through the basket, every once
in a while, we understand!
Now we have a Certain most 1
beautiful, most popular, most intel- 1
ligent, most sought-after, most
devastating Kampus Queen still'
strolling about the Quad, although
she has publicly promised to marry
, herself and all the mosts to a Cer- 1
! tain prominent athlete.
Everyone knows that this is a
rumor, of course—we dassent go
I near enough to ask for ourselves.
Whether or not the weather
satisfies the rest of youse guys,
we personally are practicing on
the chorus of "Turn On the j
Heat." And the DU's can't boast
any more 'cause everybody else
has a swimming pool in bis own
back yard, too.
Yes (in spite of all the beefing), |
we have with us Lagunita once
more again already today. And the
little publicity hound who goes in
| for the first dip of this season will
j really find something to wear water- I
- wings about.
i
Everything comes to him who
waits. Catching up on news,
we're glad USC won their New
Year's battle—but they really
had <o fight to do it, and that
makes us glad, too.
— !
And we have also with us- one
! Rebekah ("Father") Brown, who's
| Very much worried because Law
j students at Oxford have to under
let arid lectures in genuine Greek.
: Congratulations, ol' boy, ol' boy!

Yes (in spite of all the beefing), |
we have with us Lagunita once
more again already today. And the
little publicity hound who goes in

j really find something to wear water- I

Everything comes to him who
waits. Catching up on news,
we're glad USC won their New
Year's battle—but they really
had <o fight to do it, and that
makes us glad, too.

And we have also with us- one
! Rebekah ("Father") Brown, who's
| Very much worried because Law
j students at Oxford have to under
let arid lectures in genuine Greek.
: Congratulations, ol' boy, ol' boy!
A glance around favorite nooks
and crannies of the old stamping
ground is as depressing as an eve
ning spent watching "Frankenstein.''
Put Old Man Depression in the
role of the monster, and turn him
loose among the ranks, and you'll
know fairly accurately what's hap
pened to a lot of your pals.
Pretty soon we'll he having
Women's Rushing to worry
about, with ail its complica
tions—and the lovely Greek
maidens will haul out the best
chinaware, and remember that
their pals in Deke and Beta and
Sigma Nu and Ad Infinitum
houses aren't such bad eggs
after all—at least they have
some pretty cute little freshman
sisters—and "Could we borrow
a dozen of your least-scratched
chairs for a couple of weeks?"
Pleasant surprise, isn't it, to sud
denly look up and find yourself a
popular man-of-the-hour, and even
a knight on wheels (if you have a
car that sports anything over 3%
cylinders)? We could mention more
than one sweet little innocent Roble
gal who's been persuaded on an
all-afternoon drive through the
foothills that although an ARROW
points up toward the farthest end of
the Row, you're safer when you
KAPPA da' climax by getting locked
up behind a KEY.
You'll all be pretty well
pleased to learn that out of a
hazy nothingness we've sudden
ly acquired a basketball team.
Just about broke the boys' hearts
to stay here all during the holi
days, to live on training rations
while the rest of the world grew
portly with turkey and pudding

—so they've started in to do
some breaking on their own ac
count. They even put the ball
through the basket, every once
in a while, we understand!
Now we have a Certain most 1
beautiful, most popular, most intel- 1
ligent, most sought-after, most
devastating Kampus Queen still'
strolling about the Quad, although
she has publicly promised to marry
, herself and all the mosts to a Cer- 1
! tain prominent athlete.
Everyone knows that this is a
rumor, of course—we dassent go
I near enough to ask for ourselves.
Whether or not the weather
satisfies the rest of youse guys,
we personally are practicing on
the chorus of "Turn On the j
Heat." And the DU's can't boast
any more 'cause everybody else
has a swimming pool in bis own
back yard, too.
