## A 						MORAL ATTRIBUTE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I suppose that the Honor Code,
like certain matters of national pol
licy, should be looked upon as an
experiment noble in purpose and
high in idealism. To me, however,
the Code is comparable to a bursted
appendix—a dangerous vestigal re
main in the academic body—re
calling the time when Stanford Uni
versity consisted of a few hundred
conscientious students who wanted
to do something else besides crash
ing through with a high Bawl Out
average to show the folks back
home, or demonstrating uncanny
mental ability by securing the high
est possilple grade with the Jeast
possible effort.
Our moral curvc is little, if any,
higher than that of the general so
ciety around us. We need our proc
tors just as much as society needs
its police departments and armed
forces. The spirit of anarchism and
personal responsibility won't check
the weaklings on the lower end of

I the moral curve within or without
the confines of this University.
More than that, the Men's Coun
' cil persists in a policy logically in
! consistent with the principles upon
which the Honor Code is supposed
to rest. I refer to the outrageous
penalties inflicted upon those few
; whom the vague operations of thv>
i Code apprehends. They are the
i scapegoats—the "living examples"—
akin to the decapitated heads thai
once graced the spiked gates of me
dieval cities as "terrible warnings"
to prospective criminals entering.
! Here we see the ridiculous anomoly
l of a so-called Code of Honor, b; sod
on a spirit of personal responsi
bility, now enforced by threat of
excessive punishments apparently
i intended to prevent others from vio
lating their plighted trust. Why not
recognize the issues to be these
honor, a moral attribute, cannot be
j enforced, and even if it were pos
• sible to do so, the Honor Code, b\
: definition, would automatically dis
i appear? —Leonard J. Bloom.
