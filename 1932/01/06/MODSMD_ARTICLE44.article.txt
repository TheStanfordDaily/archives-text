THE BREADWINNER — By W.
Somerset Maugham. Double-day
Doran. Now York. 1931. $2. (At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
It should be remembered that
Somerset Maugham has written suc
cessful comedy. This venture is,
however, far less happy than, for
example, "The Constant Wife."
Maugham, it would seem, having
admired that gay youngster, Noel
Coward, has attempted a mixture
of his own wit with a lower varia
tion of Noel's—to the considerable
detriment of each.
Of ihc three acts the first is by
far th? best, particularly those
scenes in which the younger and
older generation dissect each other.
If Maugham had been able to keep
up this idiocy for the other two acts
without injecting a sort of cynical
whimsy the arguments of Mr.

Charles Battle might have been
more enjoyable.
As it stands the play is more
amusing than junk-like—nothing
But the Truth or Officer GG6 --a slight
achievement. Funnier than a good
percentage of alleged comedy it
still leaves much to be desired. Yea,
Somerset, back to the drawing
room, the prosperous suburbs won't
j do. > —J.S.S.

: MARTIN'S SUMMER—By Vicki
Baum. Translated from (he Ger
man by Basil Creighton. J. J.
Little & Ives Co. 1931. (At the
Stanford Bookstore.)
Being neither very well done nor
I very poorly done this trailer to
1 "Grand Hotel" misses both the finish
[ and the originality which mark the
j latter. "Martin's Summer" will
l probably ride successfully on the

fame of "Grand Hotel" but it lacks
any particular merit of its own.
The story is a too prolonged talc
of th» adventures of a young scien
tist who takes a job as swimming
instructor for the summer. Even
with a season of Lagunita awaiting
us the detailed description of swim
ming strokes seems overdone. This
is all by way of saying that the
book is not much more than tripe.
