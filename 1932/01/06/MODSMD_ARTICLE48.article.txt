"Oli, well, what the hell?"
'5 hat's what a small but jovial
crowd thought as it gathered in
the Pavilion for the Stanford-
Oregon State basketball fracas
last Wednesday night.
In the first place, the Indian
five had dropped four straight
ganu's, and had looked bad
doing it. Very bad indeed.
Hadn't a stale Pittsburgh team
won a sad 22 to 11 affair just the
night before? And hadn't Stan
ford shooting been so pitiful
that only TWO field goals were
registered in the entire game by
the Redshirts?
"Well, what the hell?" thought
the crowd. "Might as well go
over to the Pavilion for a few
laughs as hunt up a fourth for
bridge." •
It was a crowd that had come to
be entertained like a gathering at
a wrc tling show. There was little
I'ope held out for seeing any bas
ketball.
The crowd had come to laugh;
and laugh it did but not AT Stan
ford. An overnight miracle had been
wrought, and the Indian quintet
played the best basketball so far
t liis season to trounce the strong
invaders, 45 to 32.
The galleries laughed at the mir
aele. They laughed when "Frenchy"
LaCombe scored more points in the
opening minutes of play than the
entire team had the night before.
They laughed when one of the of
ficials gave the ball to the wrong
man for a free throw at the wrong
basket. They laughed tit. almost any
thing.
But they positively roared at
(he at:tics of "Tiny Tom" Cordry.
Tiie diminutive Stanford forward
played like a wild man. The
smallest player on the floor, he
showed his heftier opponents
jli-,i how the game should be
played.
Time after time he took the ■
ball out of the hands of the
Oregon Staters. lie ran around
them, through them, under
them. He was always in the
right place at the right time.
To cap the climax he inter
cepted the ball in the middle of
the floor and dribbled all the
way to the basket to sink a shot
as the invaders looked wonder
ingly on.
They gave him a big hand
when Coach John Bunn took
him out for a few minutes late
in the second half, but he was
soon back to finish the half,
Kell.\*cvidently having been out
too fate the night before, or
something.
It was a large night for Tiny
Tom. and an entertaining one
for the faithful.
One Emile LaCombe, otherwise
"Frenchy," found himself in the
same game. All he did was score 21
points, sinking baskets from crazy
angles all over the court and mak
ing it look easy. It was the first
( ccasion this season that he showed
the form of his high-school and
jnysee days.
Dave Packard was also "hot," not
only controlling the tip-off through
out, but working smoothly at the
pivot position and dropping in his
full share of field goals.
Regarding LaCombe, one of the
Daily operatives who "knew him
when" reports that in his prep
school days at Palo Alto High his
named appeared in the scorebooks
as "Lacombe," without the capital
"C," and that it was simply "Emil,"
not "Emile."
And not only that, lie was
"The Frog" in those days!
