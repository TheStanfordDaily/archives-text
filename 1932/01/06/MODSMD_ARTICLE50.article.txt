# Card Basketeers Begin Practice For Bruin Tilt
## COACH BUNN MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER TUESDAY'S DRILL New Schedule Policy This Year Proves Boon In Seasoning Squad 
### Dick Rodda 
"Much better than last year at
this time."
This was John Bunn's comment
concerning the Stanford basketball
team as he concluded a long prac
tice session last ni&ht in prepara
tion for the first conference game
with U.C.L.A. here next Friday
night.
"Under a new policy of schedul
ing practice games the squad is in
better shape to lake on each con
ference team individually," said
Bunn. "Last year several mid-sea
son practice tilts interfered with the
team's stride."
With Monday night's win over
Santa Clara the Card cagers came
out on the long end of a seven
game practice season. Victories were
chalked up against San Jose State,
Oregon State, U.S.F., and Santa
Clara, while St. Mary's, Olympic
Club, unci Pittsburgh defeated Stan
ford.
Although this record may not
seem impressive to a Stanford fan,
it is noted that three of the victories
were in the last three games played.
And in the words of Coach Bunn,
the practice season was entirely ex
perimental. The games were played
for the purpose of conditioning all
of the men on the squad and to
correct mistakes made in the open
ing contests. According to the coach,
many serious faults have been
ironed out.
Meanwhile, the U.C.L.A. Bruins
have completed a similar schedule
with five victories and three de
feats. The Bruin live decisively
trounced the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, Whittier, and the Hollywood
Athletic Club. They were beaten by
the Pasadena Majors and twice by
the Utah Aggies. But in the third
game of the Utah series they re
versed proceedings with a decisive
30 to 21 victory.
These results may indicate some
what the strength of the Bruin out
fit, but they can be of little value
in comparing the Uclans with Stan
ford inasmuch as few intrasectional
games have been played thus far.
Bunn drilled his squad offensively
last with the first string line
up of Codry, LaCombe, Packard,
Norgard, and Baker scrimmaging
against the subs. Rintala alternated
with Norgard at guard.

Although this record may not
seem impressive to a Stanford fan,
it is noted that three of the victories
were in the last three games played.
And in the words of Coach Bunn,
the practice season was entirely ex
perimental. The games were played
for the purpose of conditioning all
of the men on the squad and to
correct mistakes made in the open
ing contests. According to the coach,
many serious faults have been
ironed out.
Meanwhile, the U.C.L.A. Bruins
have completed a similar schedule
with five victories and three de
feats. The Bruin live decisively
trounced the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, Whittier, and the Hollywood
Athletic Club. They were beaten by
the Pasadena Majors and twice by
the Utah Aggies. But in the third
game of the Utah series they re
versed proceedings with a decisive
30 to 21 victory.
These results may indicate some
what the strength of the Bruin out
fit, but they can be of little value
in comparing the Uclans with Stan
ford inasmuch as few intrasectional
games have been played thus far.
Bunn drilled his squad offensively
last with the first string line
up of Codry, LaCombe, Packard,
Norgard, and Baker scrimmaging
against the subs. Rintala alternated
with Norgard at guard.
"Much better than last year at
this time."
This was John Bunn's comment
concerning the Stanford basketball
team as he concluded a long prac
tice session last ni&ht in prepara
tion for the first conference game
with U.C.L.A. here next Friday
night.
"Under a new policy of schedul
ing practice games the squad is in
better shape to lake on each con
ference team individually," said
Bunn. "Last year several mid-sea
son practice tilts interfered with the
team's stride."
With Monday night's win over
Santa Clara the Card cagers came
out on the long end of a seven
game practice season. Victories were
chalked up against San Jose State,
Oregon State, U.S.F., and Santa
Clara, while St. Mary's, Olympic
Club, unci Pittsburgh defeated Stan
ford.
