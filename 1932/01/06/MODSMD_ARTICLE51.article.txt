# SPALDING RETURNS; PROSPECT OF GOOD POLO TEAM BETTER
## 
### 
With Hufus Spalding again eli
gible to play, prospects for a more
prosperous polo season at Stanford
become brighter. Considerably han
dicapped in previous games by the
lack of an experienced No. 1 man,
the Redshirt riders should show a
much better balanced team in fu
ture matches.
"The team is going to show up a
lot better this season," Captain
Richard A. Gordan declared yes
terday. "We have four players now
all of about the same experience and
ability, and I think we're going to
work a lot better as a team than
we have so far. This squad should
develop into fully as good a one as
we had last year."
Because of bad weather condi
tions lately, no definite games have
been scheduled here. If the field
drys out sufficiently, matches will
be arranged with peninsula teams
some time this month.
