# KEITH GLEDHILL CERTAIN OF CARD TENNIS PROSPECT
## 
### 
Captain Keith Gledhill, star
Stanford netman, is back on
the campus this quarter in a
highly optimistic frame of mind
as to the coming season. Gled
hill has been practicing the
entire autumn quarter at San
ta Barbara.
As to the prospects, he sizes
the situation up as much the
same as last year, feeling that
"a big and successful season is
assured, and all the matches
easy except U.C.L.A."
Elbert Lewis, Cliff Robbins,
Leonard Dworkin, and Jack
Tidball combine to make the
southern outfit a strong con
tender, just as it had promise
of being last year. Gledhill
thinks California will be a
comparatively easy hurdle.
As to his own chances with
the American Davis Cup team,
he can make no definite state
ment, since he has received no
word as yet.
