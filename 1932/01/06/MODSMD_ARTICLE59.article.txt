# TRACK IN BETTER SHAPE THAN MEN AFTER LONG RAIN
## Sophomore Men Urged To Try Out As Managers Of Cinder Team 
### Dick Strouse 
There is still need of more
sophomore track managers. All
sophomores wishing to try out
for managerial positions need
only to report to any junior
manager any afternoon at 4
o'clock. Track managers are
given full credit for physical
education.

A careful review of the Stanford '
! track situation revealed that the j
I old oval—that famous cinder path- ,
j way on which Dink Templeton's
' prides prepare themselves every fall
i and winter for their record-break
j ing performances during the regu
j lar track season—is in much better '
i condition at the present time than
I are the stalwarts who daily kick
I these cinders in each other's eyes.
! The track itself, in spite of the re-
I cent Florida weather, is in fine
j shape, but the runners who hope
j to defeat U.S.C. this year are, due ,
!to the wet vacation, not so fast. (
Yesterday afternoon most of the ■
i boys came out and loosened up the ,
j muscles that have been used more
for dancing than running the past
two weeks. Particularly encourag- i
ing was the appearance of Nellie j
Grey and Here Laborde, who spent j
the fall quarter cavorting for Pop
Warner on the gridiron instead of
for Templeton and Ellington on the j
track. 1
