# SIXTY SIGN UP FOR VARSITY BASEBALL; MANY LETTERMEN OUT FOR PRACTICE
## 
### BOB WADE 
With a record sign-up of more
than sixty prospective ball-chasers,
and more to come when the hoop
season ends, Coach Harry Wolter
sent his varsity horsehiders through
the first limbering up of the year
yesterday on the new sunken dia
mond.
Forecasts for the defense of last
year's championship point to an
even more successful conquest this
season if the turnout of veterans
means anything. The list of letter
men includes: Philippi at second,
Delmas at short, Campbell in right,
Livermore behind the plate, and
Rintala in center when basketball
ends.
Coach Wolter has a pair of flossy
flychasers from last year's frosh in
Goldman and Miles, as well as some
good new material in Gabriel, Estes,
and Stark.
Graduation left the ball club with
only three real holes in the lineup,
and these should be filled with
added strength to the team from
the wealth of reserve material that
greeted Coach Wolter.
Although predictions are danger
ous so early in the year, with Wood
worth and Hearn battling for the
initial sack, and half a dozen good

I ball hawks out for Captain Hun
i ken's vacated position in left : field, it
| looks as if the real problem centers
| around the hot corner. The gradua
i tion of Dykes Johnston leaves a
| hole at third that will be hard to
I fill, and Coach Wolter is on the
j lookout for someone who can handle
| the hot ones as well as hit in the
! pinches.
