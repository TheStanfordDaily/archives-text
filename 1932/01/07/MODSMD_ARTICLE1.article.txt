# CAGERS READY FOR TILT WITH FLASHY BRUINS
## Bunn Declares Westwood Most Colorful Outfit In Coast League LINTHICUM BRUIN STAR Cards Are Determined To Avenge Last Years Loss 
### 
With Friday night's conference
opener a mere 48 hours in the fu
ture, Coach John Bunn put his
charges through a stiff workout
last night in preparation for the
flashy Bruins of Westwood.
"From the spectators' point of
view they are the most colorful
outfit in the loop," Bunn declared.
"They have a fast-breaking offense
similar to ours, and they handle the
ball fast and accurately."
Linthicum Leader
The U.C.L.A. attack is built
around their captain, Dick Linthi
cum, who drops back to center after
the tip-off. At the other forward
berth is a "find" answering to the
name of Piper, who has been giving
pre-season opponents plenty of
trouble.
At guards the Bruins present two
experienced men in Brockmarkle
and Lemmke, but they will un
doubtedly miss the services of the
giant Lubin, Young, and Shye, who
were lost by graduation.
Rose, a newcomer to campus hoop
fans, completes the probable start
ing quintet that will face the Cards
Friday night.
Bunn Experimenting
Coach Bunn is still experiment
ing with his guards, and last night
had Baker and Norgard, Edelen,
Baker and Schnetka, Tod and Rin
tala working in those combinations.
After a protracted session of free
throw practice, Bunn sent LaCombe,
Cordry, Packard, and one combina
tion of guards after another against
the shock troops. Last year the
Cards made the mistake of trying
to keep up with the terrific pace
that th'j Bruins set in the first half,
and as a result they fell an easy
victim to the heavy score which the
visitors piled up in the initial period.
This season the Indians are spend
ing more time building up a stone
wall defense, learning to sink free
throws, and perfecting co-ordina
tion and teamwork.
Packard Ready
Without much knowledge about
the ability of the Bruins' new cen
ter, but with a very good idea of
what big Dave Packard can accom
plish, Farm fans are looking for
ward to seeing Stanford get the
tip-off when the evening's festivi
ties get under way. The sophomoi'e
center ought to be primed to give
the Southerners a busy, if unprofit
able, time of it.
The loss of their two dead-eye
forwards, Knowles and VonHagen,
left the Bruins other things to
worry about besides graduating
guards v/ho reached out over op
ponents and took the ball away
from them. But with Linthicum
back, and Piper taking to Coach
Caddy Works' system like a duck
to water, they figure to give the
Cards little revenge for last year's
series defeat. They will probably
make up in speed what they lost in
experience, and Coach Bunn is
driving his boys hard to send the
visitors home on the short end of
the two games to be played here
this week-end.
