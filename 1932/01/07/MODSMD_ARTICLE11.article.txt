# MAUDE RUSSELL TALKS ON CHINA
## Nationalism Has Risen Even In Face Of Strife 
### 
!
| Though the last two decades in I
I Republican China have been very i
i unhappy politically, there has been
! a tremendous growth in national.
I unity and loyalty, ampng the
! nese people, according to Miss
j Maude Russell, secretary of the Na
i tional Staff of the National Council
of the Y.W.C.A. in China. Under
the sponsorship of the Committee j
on Public Exercises Miss Russell j
reviewed "Twenty Years of the Re- j
public in China" in the Women's j
Clubhouse last night at 7:30 o'clock. !
The chief factors in building a i
national consciousness in China j
have been the student movements, |
a literary revolution, mass educa- j
I tion, anti-foreign movements, and |
i the organization of labor .since 1919. !
The attitude of China toward the j
j League of Nations has never been i
l one of confidence, stated the speak- j
j er, as this crisis especially shows. I
! The Chinese believe that it is oper- !
j ated chiefly through the machina- !
I tions of a capitalistic group and i
j think a similar Pan-Asiatic group j
is necessary for complete harmony, j
! Though the attitude of young China
! is chiefly militaristic Miss Russell |
! believes the affair will be settled I
! peacefully. As regards communism !
; the speaker stated that China as a j
j nation could quite easily conform j
| to its belief and policies.
