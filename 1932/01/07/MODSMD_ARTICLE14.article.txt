WASHINGTON, Jan. (i. </P)—' The j
possibility of a momentous move by ;
the United States, supported by j
Great Britain and France, to bring i
peace in disturbed Manchuria, hung
tonight over the State Department. \
There were strong indications j
that from conferences between Sec- I
retary Stimson and Ambassadors of 1
the European powers would come a j
strong statement of policy, perhaps '
involving invocation of the long- [
discussed nine-power Pacific treaty, i
guaranteeing the integrity of China, j
Troops Still Active
The discussions went forward as
official reports received at the State '
Department from Manchuria indi
cating a Japanese military move- !
ment toward China proper further (
perturbed the Secretary and his ad
visers.
Meanwhile, the strictly American- 1
Japanese incident growing out of j
the attack at Mukden by four Japa- i
nese on American Consul Chamber- |
lain is still unsettled.
While Secretary Stimson indi- j
cated he considered Ihe Japanese 1
expression of regret as an apology, |
he still expects further action in j
the case. He did not specify the type
of redress which may be called for.

In addition to possible invocation
of the nine-power ti'eaty the ad- j
ministration is considering other!
courses of action in the Far East.
The nine-power Pacific treaty,
