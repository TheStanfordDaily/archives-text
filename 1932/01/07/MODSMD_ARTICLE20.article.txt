# Nationals Outlawed As Britain Decrees India In Siege State
## Sweeping Ordinances Strike at Nationalist Activity; British Commerce Suffers Serious Slump As Gandhi Followers Remain Defiant 
### 
J |£OMBAY, Jan. (J. (iV) —All turbulent India was in what amounted to i
state of siege today as the British government's extraordinary sum- 1
; mary measures, dealing with every phase of nationalist activity, became
operative. New and sweeping special decrees, covering the whole Bombay
presidency, outlawed 500 nationalist organizations, including such institu- !
tions as anti-drink leagues, spinning schools, and boys' hoarding schools. !
All citizens were warned that, without trial, they might be sentenced :
to two years of hard labor for peaceful picketing, persuading anyone not
I to pay taxes, boycotting British goods or public servants, or contributing
funds to the nationalist cause. Other ordinances, operative in all India, j
i empowered the authorities to fine even children for nationalist activities, I

the fines being collectable from their,
parents. Collective fines may be im
posed on whole villages and towns. I
The authorities may make ar- i
rests, raids, and searches wilhoutj
warrants or order the imprisonment
of persons without trial. They may '
control public utility services, posts, 1
telegraphs, railroads, and steam
| ships, and exercise the l ight of con- .
fiscation of property and eminent I
domain.
The government may seize stocks 1
of commodities from private citi
zens or corporations, compensating
them at a price fixed by the govern
ment. The publication of false ru- i
mors may be punished by a year's
imprisonment. Local authorities are
empowered to demand the assist
ance of any citizen in keeping pub
lic order or in guarding life and ■
property.
Mobs Defiant
Almost every prominent leader of j
the all-India National Congress has j
been arrested. Police took them in |
by the scores. Thus far in the con- j
flict the casualties include four!
dead, two at Benares, and two at 1
; Allahabad. Police fired fourteen 1
j rounds on a defiant mob at Allaha- j
| bad yesterday, killing two persons '
j and injuring 100. Numerous others 1
| were injured in a police lathi charge 1
I at Cawnpore. Small boys at Cawn- I
pore stoned a policeman, injuring j
I him so badly he had to go to a hos- 1
! p-tal.
In Nationalist strongholds through- 1
| out India armed military and police
j forces paraded the streets to show |
j their strength.
Commerce Suffers
I Banks, retail stores, and British
j insurance and shipping companies!
i suffered a serious slump in trade. I
! Nearly all Hindu stores, schools, i
| and colleges remained closed in '
| mourning for the arrest of Mahatrria j
j Gandhi, the leader of the Nation- j
j alists.
Both the government and the Na- j
tionalists still played a watching
game, waiting to see each other's j
plans before'launching a heavy of
' fensive.

I that if the government arrested all
Nationalist leaders, as it has
! planned, the illiterate masses, left 1
j without guidance, might take mat- j
I ters into their own hands with vio- J
: lent results.

J |£OMBAY, Jan. (J. (iV) —All turbulent India was in what amounted to i
state of siege today as the British government's extraordinary sum- 1
; mary measures, dealing with every phase of nationalist activity, became
operative. New and sweeping special decrees, covering the whole Bombay
presidency, outlawed 500 nationalist organizations, including such institu- !
tions as anti-drink leagues, spinning schools, and boys' hoarding schools. !
All citizens were warned that, without trial, they might be sentenced :
to two years of hard labor for peaceful picketing, persuading anyone not
I to pay taxes, boycotting British goods or public servants, or contributing
funds to the nationalist cause. Other ordinances, operative in all India, j
i empowered the authorities to fine even children for nationalist activities, I

the fines being collectable from their,
parents. Collective fines may be im
posed on whole villages and towns. I
The authorities may make ar- i
rests, raids, and searches wilhoutj
warrants or order the imprisonment
of persons without trial. They may '
control public utility services, posts, 1
telegraphs, railroads, and steam
| ships, and exercise the l ight of con- .
fiscation of property and eminent I
domain.
The government may seize stocks 1
of commodities from private citi
zens or corporations, compensating
them at a price fixed by the govern
ment. The publication of false ru- i
mors may be punished by a year's
imprisonment. Local authorities are
empowered to demand the assist
ance of any citizen in keeping pub
lic order or in guarding life and ■
property.
Mobs Defiant
Almost every prominent leader of j
the all-India National Congress has j
been arrested. Police took them in |
by the scores. Thus far in the con- j
flict the casualties include four!
dead, two at Benares, and two at 1

j rounds on a defiant mob at Allaha- j
| bad yesterday, killing two persons '
j and injuring 100. Numerous others 1
| were injured in a police lathi charge 1
I at Cawnpore. Small boys at Cawn- I
pore stoned a policeman, injuring j
I him so badly he had to go to a hos- 1
