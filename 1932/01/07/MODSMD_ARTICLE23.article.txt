# B. A. C. DECIDES GRID COACHES' POSTS TONIGHT
## Rumor Indicates Possible Shifts In Positions At First Meeting SCHEDULE INCOMPLETE Warner Contract Expected On Five-Year Basis 
### 
j Stanford's football coaching situ
j ation, about which many rumors
' have been floating around for the
j past several weeks, may be ironed
| out tonight as the B.A.C. official
i body convenes at the Union for the
j first time this year.
One of the latest peeps out of
t Dame Rumor is that Jimmy "Rab
-1 bit" Bradshaw, freshman coach, and
''Chuck ' Winterburn, varsity back
| field coach, will exchange positions.
It is contended that Winterburn is
; naturally a head coach and should
I direct the frosh squad while Brad-
I shaw would be more valuable a.
an assistant to the "Old Fox."
Attitude Unknown
It is probable that the B.A.C.
would pass upon sucli a change if
j recommended by Warner, but
I whether or not Warner is behind
j this "new shift" is still in the dark.
Another recent rumor that may or
| may not be squelched tonight is
j that Pop Warner is to be offered a
j five-year contract by Stanford Uni
j versity. Warner's present contract
| expires August 31 and recent offers
j tendered him by certain Eastern
i universities have caused alarm
among Stanford followers who are
desirous of making Pop's stay more
secure.
Admits Offers
j Warner admits that he has had
| offers of several positions that arc
j more lucrative than his present one,
! but states nothing further except
j that none of the offers comes from
' either New York University or
I Princeton.
Because of the fact that the
j Northwestern game, to have been
| played here on Oct. 8, has been
| cancelled, Stanford's 1932 football
I schedule is still incomplete. This
I leaves the team with an open date
j which will probably be filled to
| night.
Dons Considered
No opponent for this date has
j been announced ' officially but the
| S.F.U. "Dors" have been under con
| sideration.
The intersectional contest was
| postponed until 1934 at the request
lof Northwestern. The original
agreement was for a game here in
1932 and a return game at Chicago
during the World's Fair in 1933. The
1933 game was unaffected by the
change.
