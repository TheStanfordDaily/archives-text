Bill Leiser, the San Francisco Examiner's football ex
perl, who gets the inside information on practically every
thing that ever happens athletically on the Stanford
campus, broke out yesterday morning with an "unofficial"
report that the Stanford football coaching staff was going
to be switched around and that Head Coach Glenn S. War
ner is still considering offers from Eastern universities.
The reported switch, according to Leiser, sends Jimmy
Bradshaw, freshman grid coach, to the post of varsity
backfield mentor, while Chuck Winterburn, the present
hack field instructor, takes over the reins'of the freshman
job. All this is instigated by none other than Warner him
self, Leiser intimates.

Of course, Warner is named for practically every va
cant coaching post in (he United States, and has been for
Ihc past five years. Immediately after the Dartmouth game,
lie was sent hv I lie sports scribes to New York University
to replace Chick Median, and last week the bovs had it all
decided that the Old Fox was going to San Francisco Uni
versity next year.
Warner's present five-year contract expires on August
.'{l of this year. It is fairly certain that he will accept an
other five-year term if he is offered one by the University,
but until that offer is made, he is keeping his mouth shut
e.bout any other positions that he may have been offered.
The Bradshaw-Wintcrburn change is something else
again, but if it does materialize, you can bet it is because
Warner decides it. (ilenn Scobcy has stood by Ins chunky
assistant when the latter was under fire before, and it is a
safe wager that he is not letting anyone dictate to him now.
But all this is likely to come out in the wash tonight, when
the Board of Athletic Control holds its monthly meeting.
Incidentally, the name of Stanford's opponent for the Oc
tobers date vacated by Northwestern will also be disclosed,
in all probability. Until tonight, it is nothing but idle
rumor.
