# FIFTEEN LINES
## 
### 
When the editor and Associate Editor Phil Humphreys
had reached this point in I lie column, they discovered that
they had written themselves out. Which, the readers might
observe, is a fine thing, bul the fact remains that it takes
some 70-odd lines to lill this column, and when you have
only ")"), what are you going t?) do about it?
The root of the* trouble lies in the unwarranted absence
of Associate Editor Willis Sullivan, who wired his room
mate last Monday that he was in Memphis, Tennessee and
Unit he might possibly return the end of the week. The
writer would not care to speculate on what Sullivan is do
ing in Memphis, hut he has a pretty good idea. At all
(vents, he is not here, and as three men can write 70 lines
with greater ease than can two men, stuff like this has to be
used to make the column reach to the masthead.
