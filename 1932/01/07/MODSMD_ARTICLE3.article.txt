# NEW DAILY ROUTES TO BE MADE SOON
## 
### 
Students residing in May
field and Menlo Park will ob
tain the Stanford Daily at the
Bookstore. This service is ne
cessitated because of the ex
cessive postage rates to those
districts which lie so near to
tho campus itself.
Those addresses which have
been changed in this quarter's
registration and which are not
receiving the paper at the pres
ent time will be given regular
delivery service as soon as the
new routes are issued. Com
plaints should be promptly
made to the Circulation De
partment of the Daily in order
that errors in the routing may
be corrected.
