# BULL SESSION

It is a favorite sport of collegians
to jump with cleated boots on the
soft, round waists of the older
generation. It is great fun to mock
and ridicule the old fogies who can't
understand youth. In fact to be mis
interpreted by one's elders makes
one a martyr to the new ways of
the younger generation. Wo in our
teens and twenties cannot conceived
of the r-bysmal ignorance and lack
of memory of the older generation
which leads them to deride all
things held dear to the mouth and,
perhaps, mind of youth.

During this Christmas vacation,
however, some things happened
which shocked us so severely that
we almost lost an old very fixed
idea. To part willingly with a pet
idea, or even to come near to part
ing with it, is indeed a very rare
and vary wonderful happening; and
so we relate them with a slight
blush of shame.

We had always assumed without
questioning that we were part and
parcel of the younger generation.
Had we not borne our little crosses
in every argument with the elders,
Yet, this vacation it was clearly
proven to us that in relation to
youngsters in grammar school, we
in college are just as old fogyish,
just as wet blanketish as any fifty
year-old that ever broke up a house
party. Eight years ago we were
reveling in grammar school pleas
ures. Yet today we have forgotten
and fail to understand those things
almost entirely. Why I should leave
warm comfort between the covers
to take a little sister or brother to
school a half hour early so they can
"play" on the grounds I find diffi
culty in seeing. Yet, less than ten
years ago I was making the same
requests at the same ungoldly hours.

Sliding down banisters is a com
paratively harmless activity; but the 1
moment some ten-year-old strad
dles the smooth wood, a deterring
"no" is our first reaction. Why? It
is not so very long ago that we |
were doing the same thing; rebel
ling at those who frustrated our in
stinctive desire to slide, and won
dering at the unexplainable narrow
mindedness and lack of considera
tion of cur elders.

Examples might be i - epeated but
to no good purpose. The question
is, why does it seem inevitable that !
a-few years' change in age should!
so warp the outlook as to not under
stand our juniors? If we of the j
"younger generation" (so-called) do
not wish to become the intolerant, !
old-fashioned, well-meaning but I

OLDER GENERATIONS

| pitied ciders that now spend their
| days criticizing modern but never
j theless normal expressions of
j youthful spirit, it is time to about
face, or at least do a right turn.
And those that think they under
stand "kids"—let them spend sev
eral weeks with several healthy
youngsters. The result will be either
one of two realizations: that a de
liberate effort is needed to under
j stand them or that kids today aren't
. what they used to be. Which one is
arrived at will depend on the plas
ticity of mind of the individual con
ducting the experiment.
