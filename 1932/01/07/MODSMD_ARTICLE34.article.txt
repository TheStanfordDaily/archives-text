MURDER ON THE TEN YARD
LINE—By John Stephen Strange.
Doublcday Do ran. New York.
I9JI. (At the Magazine Shop.)
("This was a strange world he had
stumbled into—a world with which
he was totally unfamiliar" — John
Stephen Strange in "Murder on the
Ten Yard Line").
Striving for the different, the ex
otic, the bizarre, writers of alleged
thrillers have utilized as scenes for
their slaughter: clothes-chutes, dog
houses, light-wells, choir lofts, light
houses, dark cellars, dark attics, the
North Pole, the South Pole, back
stages, coffins ....
Unfortunately, however, having
got a somewhat extraordinary lo
cale, these gentlemen seem satisfied
with the timeworn plot and its ac
companying totterers.
Mr. Strange has not deviated from
the lamentably over-used formula.
Setting his performance in a sta
dium be blandly thereafter intro
duces clear-eyed, rosy-cheeked
girls, round-faced and good
humored lads, a few fearful ma
niacs purporting to be professors
and alumni, and a detective whose
face is cool and expressionless.
Mr. Strange is a sort of semi
sophisticated Burt L. Standish
whose Rcver Boys want to take
murder terribly seriously but sim
ply have to eat hamburgers on
whole wheat while discussing it.
But I can't stop you if you want to
read it. —J.S.S.

This particular effusion of Holly
| wood was mis-named with typical
I disregard of reason merely to ad
, vertise Jean Harlow's particular
| shade of "crowning glory."
i Actually it is the story of a young
i and uncouth reporter who crashes
i the home afld finally the heart of
; the sophisticated young society
Miss, Jean Harlow, and inevitably
J becomes a "bird in a gilded cage."
He eventually escapes into the wait
| ing arms of his companion girl re
; porter. That sounds trite but it is

not as bad as it might have been j
since it is enlivened by snappy lines \
and not a few funny situations, j
Robert Williams is the young re- j
porter who doesn't wear garters and )
does a good job of it but we still j
fail to see where Hollywood got |
their impression of the typical news
paper man. We have seen a lot of ;
them but never one like that. Lor- ,
etta Young as the girl reporter is |
good and beats the Harlow woman !
in looks, acting, and everything j
else.
A moderately good feature good |
for quite a few laughs but accom- l
panied by the most dismal attempt J
at a comedy that it has yet been j
our misfortune to sit through.

"It was quite all right and it did j
not make much difference, not very
much after all," muses cynical Ma- I
jor Wandrell, lying pinned under I
an unwieldy trunk as the ship on j
which he is sailing for Europe slow- j
ly sinks.
Major Wandrell. here somewhat !
unconsciously if accurately esti- j
males the value of M. Lohnke's vol- j
ume. It is pretty dull stuff, reminds j
one rather too acutely of the care- I
lessly meticulous performance of a !
college sophomore who has read far i
too much of Hemingway, Faulkner, i
and Joyce.
The book invites comparison with •
both "Grand Hotel" and "S.S. San j
Pedro." Like the first it considers I
intimately the condition of indi- j
viduals in a mob and in plot wan- I
derings brings them together. The !
second relates the final voyage of a j
ship. In this the two volumes are •
identical, uncomfortably so, since
neither is particulaily worthy of
publication, and their (or its) dual
appearance an enlightening sugges
tion as to the capabilities of the edi
torial mind. Ho hum. Back to Gals- :

j For want of a nail a kingdom was
lost; for want of a picture a title
| was lost. This seems to be what
| happens when just enough humor
is introduced to spoil an ordinary
I film but not enough to make it a
i legitimate comedy. The barber
! father, whose daughter is marrying
j into society, provides many hearty
j laughs when he exhibits his vaude
j ville tricks at a swanky dinner
j party. However, this comic relief
| overlaps the dramatic scenes: under
! stress Marilyn Miller pushes over
the dinrer table and Ben Lyon
j showers papers about his head and
| looks like Alice in Wonderland.

PENEOD AND SAM—AI Ihe Var
sity Theatre.
Booth Tarkington's well-known
book might have been mutilated be
yond recognition, in the filming—as
is generally the case when popular

books are made into pictures. Bui
largely due to the spectacularly fine
acting oi Leon Janney as Penrod,
this show won't disappoint you re
gardless of how fond you wi re of
Penrod and Sam as a book.

You will remember two things
about it: Penrod's funny, boyish
laugh, and the naturalness of the
scenes. The "gang," and their initia
tions, and secret lodge, and carni
vals; and lights are the real stuff.
Penrod is the outstanding star, but
the role of Sam is only a little less
appealing.

Just one thing hurt. We expected
"Marjorie" to be a lovely little Ihing,
with flaxen curls down to her waist,
and dimples, but she turned out
to be a small, dark, thin child with
a piping voice—and we don't feel
this was exactly what Booth Tark
ington had in mind. —M.L.R.

this show won't disappoint you re

vals; and lights are the real stuff.
Penrod is the outstanding star, but
the role of Sam is only a little less
appealing.

Just one thing hurt. We expected
"Marjorie" to be a lovely little Ihing,
with flaxen curls down to her waist,

to be a small, dark, thin child with
a piping voice—and we don't feel

PENEOD AND SAM—AI Ihe Var

Booth Tarkington's well-known

books are made into pictures. Bui
largely due to the spectacularly fine
acting oi Leon Janney as Penrod,
this show won't disappoint you re
gardless of how fond you wi re of
Penrod and Sam as a book.

You will remember two things
about it: Penrod's funny, boyish
laugh, and the naturalness of the
scenes. The "gang," and their initia
tions, and secret lodge, and carni
vals; and lights are the real stuff.
Penrod is the outstanding star, but
the role of Sam is only a little less
appealing.

Just one thing hurt. We expected
"Marjorie" to be a lovely little Ihing,
with flaxen curls down to her waist,
and dimples, but she turned out
to be a small, dark, thin child with
a piping voice—and we don't feel
this was exactly what Booth Tark

i Actually it is the story of a young
i and uncouth reporter who crashes
i the home afld finally the heart of
; the sophisticated young society
Miss, Jean Harlow, and inevitably
J becomes a "bird in a gilded cage."
He eventually escapes into the wait
| ing arms of his companion girl re
; porter. That sounds trite but it is

not as bad as it might have been j
since it is enlivened by snappy lines \
and not a few funny situations, j
Robert Williams is the young re- j
porter who doesn't wear garters and )
does a good job of it but we still j
fail to see where Hollywood got |
their impression of the typical news
paper man. We have seen a lot of ;
them but never one like that. Lor- ,
etta Young as the girl reporter is |
good and beats the Harlow woman !
in looks, acting, and everything j
else.
A moderately good feature good |
for quite a few laughs but accom- l
panied by the most dismal attempt J
at a comedy that it has yet been j
our misfortune to sit through.

DEEP EVENING — By Eugene
Lohnkc. Jonathan Cape and Har
rison Smith. New York. 1931.
$2.50. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
"It was quite all right and it did j
not make much difference, not very
much after all," muses cynical Ma- I
jor Wandrell, lying pinned under I
an unwieldy trunk as the ship on j
which he is sailing for Europe slow- j
ly sinks.
Major Wandrell. here somewhat !
unconsciously if accurately esti- j
males the value of M. Lohnke's vol- j
ume. It is pretty dull stuff, reminds j
one rather too acutely of the care- I
lessly meticulous performance of a !
college sophomore who has read far i
too much of Hemingway, Faulkner, i
and Joyce.
The book invites comparison with •
both "Grand Hotel" and "S.S. San j
Pedro." Like the first it considers I
intimately the condition of indi- j
viduals in a mob and in plot wan- I
derings brings them together. The !
second relates the final voyage of a j
ship. In this the two volumes are •
identical, uncomfortably so, since
neither is particulaily worthy of
publication, and their (or its) dual
appearance an enlightening sugges
tion as to the capabilities of the edi
torial mind. Ho hum. Back to Gals- :
worthy. —J.S.S.

HER MAJESTY LOVE—At the
Stanford Theatre.
j For want of a nail a kingdom was
lost; for want of a picture a title
| was lost. This seems to be what
| happens when just enough humor
is introduced to spoil an ordinary
I film but not enough to make it a
i legitimate comedy. The barber
! father, whose daughter is marrying
j into society, provides many hearty
j laughs when he exhibits his vaude
j ville tricks at a swanky dinner
j party. However, this comic relief
| overlaps the dramatic scenes: under
! stress Marilyn Miller pushes over
the dinrer table and Ben Lyon
j showers papers about his head and
| looks like Alice in Wonderland.
Laurel & Hardy, always satisfy
| ing, accompany the picture in
j "Helpmates." This supplement is
I definitely comedy. —E.T.P.

PENEOD AND SAM—AI Ihe Var
sity Theatre.
Booth Tarkington's well-known
book might have been mutilated be
yond recognition, in the filming—as
is generally the case when popular

books are made into pictures. Bui
largely due to the spectacularly fine
acting oi Leon Janney as Penrod,
this show won't disappoint you re
gardless of how fond you wi re of
Penrod and Sam as a book.

You will remember two things
about it: Penrod's funny, boyish
laugh, and the naturalness of the
scenes. The "gang," and their initia
tions, and secret lodge, and carni
vals; and lights are the real stuff.
Penrod is the outstanding star, but
the role of Sam is only a little less
appealing.

Just one thing hurt. We expected
"Marjorie" to be a lovely little Ihing,
with flaxen curls down to her waist,
and dimples, but she turned out
to be a small, dark, thin child with
a piping voice—and we don't feel
this was exactly what Booth Tark
ington had in mind. —M.L.R.
