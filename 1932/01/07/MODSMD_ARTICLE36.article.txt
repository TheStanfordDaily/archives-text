# PASSAGE OF RELIEF PROGRAM BALKED BY WISCONSIN SENATOR
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 I/Pi.â€”A
dominant Senate majority ready for
swift passage of the $2,00U.000,00U
reconstruction finance corporation
was balked today by the objection
of one Republican independent.
This major measure of President
Hoover's emergency relief program
was laid before the chamber in re
drafted form by the Banking Com
mittee and promptly picked up both
Democratic and Republican support.
Senator Blaine of Wisconsin
abruptly ended an attempt to givt>
it immediate consideration. He pro
tested against "rushing." Under
Senate rules, his objection made il
necessary that the measure be de
ferred until tomorrow. Senator Wal
cott, Republican, of Connecticut,
who is in charge of the legislation,
will call it up then. Early action is
in prospect.
