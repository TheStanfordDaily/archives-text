# Frosh Cagers Set For Palo Alto High Game On Friday
## GREEN FRESHMEN HAVE CHANCE FOR SUCCESSFUL YEAR Coach Vance Fawcett Will Make Final Squad Cut This Afternoon 
### Albert Guerard 
Croon and very ragged, freshman
basketball players had their last
hard practice yesterday afternoon
for their season opener against Palo
Alto High on Friday afternoon.
Coach Vance Fawcett had the first
and second, .and third and fourth
loams scrimmaging against each
other.
Fawcett started a first quintet
composed of "Dud"' Sales, a made
over guard, at center; Al Page and
Ted Crowe, forwards; and Malla
tratl and Grisfold, guards. The sec
ond five was composed of Kelly,
center; Bacon and Thomas, for
wards; Brailley and Cox, guards.
The first stringers failed to click
consistently, but they had a big
edge over the reserves. Al Page and
Ted Crowe looked like good for
wards. The center situation was
dominated by "Dud" Sales, princi
pally because of a three-inch height
advantage over the other centers.
Height Lacking
Supporters of the Class of '35 be
moan the short stature of their
men, but the Indians will have a
height advantage at every position,
when they line up against the local
high-school five. Sales, Page, and
Griswold are big men, while Malla
tialt and Crowe are fairly small.
Palo Alto has won six out of eight
games against fairly strong compe
tition. Their defeats were at the
hands of Commerce and Lowell,
ringleaders of San Francisco high
school basketball. Although the
Vikings counted only one basket
against the Lowell Cards there
were two features of the game en
couraging to Viking supporters.
Harry Cordes, Palo Alto center,
controlled the tip-off on nearly
( very jump against Ritchie Hay, 6-
foot, 5-inch Lowell pivot man. The
Vikings likewise had little trouble
in getting the ball down under the
basket. They simply failed to find
their .shooting eye.
Improvement Shown
Fawcett's men have undoubtedly
shown improvement since early au
tumn quarter practices, but they
still have far to go to develop a
smooth-working offense. If they get
over the Palo Alto and Pittsburg
hurdles on Friday and Saturday,
thirgs should look bright for a 1932
frosh season.
The Palo Alto game will be
played at 4 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Fawcett expects to make his final

squad cut this afternoon, at which
time th" starting lineup for Friday's
came will be chosen.

men, but the Indians will have a
height advantage at every position,
when they line up against the local
high-school five. Sales, Page, and
Griswold are big men, while Malla
tialt and Crowe are fairly small.
Palo Alto has won six out of eight
games against fairly strong compe
tition. Their defeats were at the
hands of Commerce and Lowell,
ringleaders of San Francisco high
school basketball. Although the
Vikings counted only one basket
against the Lowell Cards there
were two features of the game en
couraging to Viking supporters.
Harry Cordes, Palo Alto center,
controlled the tip-off on nearly
( very jump against Ritchie Hay, 6-
foot, 5-inch Lowell pivot man. The
Vikings likewise had little trouble
in getting the ball down under the
basket. They simply failed to find
their .shooting eye.
Improvement Shown
Fawcett's men have undoubtedly
shown improvement since early au
tumn quarter practices, but they
still have far to go to develop a
smooth-working offense. If they get
over the Palo Alto and Pittsburg
hurdles on Friday and Saturday,
thirgs should look bright for a 1932
frosh season.
The Palo Alto game will be
played at 4 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Fawcett expects to make his final

squad cut this afternoon, at which
time th" starting lineup for Friday's
came will be chosen.
Croon and very ragged, freshman
basketball players had their last
hard practice yesterday afternoon
for their season opener against Palo
Alto High on Friday afternoon.
Coach Vance Fawcett had the first
and second, .and third and fourth
loams scrimmaging against each
other.
Fawcett started a first quintet
composed of "Dud"' Sales, a made
over guard, at center; Al Page and
Ted Crowe, forwards; and Malla
tratl and Grisfold, guards. The sec
ond five was composed of Kelly,
center; Bacon and Thomas, for
wards; Brailley and Cox, guards.
The first stringers failed to click
consistently, but they had a big
edge over the reserves. Al Page and
Ted Crowe looked like good for
wards. The center situation was
dominated by "Dud" Sales, princi
pally because of a three-inch height
advantage over the other centers.
Height Lacking
Supporters of the Class of '35 be
moan the short stature of their
men, but the Indians will have a
height advantage at every position,
when they line up against the local
high-school five. Sales, Page, and
Griswold are big men, while Malla
tialt and Crowe are fairly small.
