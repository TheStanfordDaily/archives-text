# BOXING MEDALS TO BE PRESENTED ON NEW POINT SYSTEM
## 
### 
Gene Tunney medals for Stanford
boxers will be awarded this quar
ter on a new basis, it was announced
today by Minor Sports Director
Harry Maloney. Each man will be
graded on a point system in which
the maximum attainable will be 20
for attendance, 20 for his attitude
towards his work, 20 for his ability,
20 for co-operation with the coaches
and 20 for his sportsmanship during
training and in bouts.
According to last year's system,
the all-university champion would
automatically be awarded the Tun
ney honors, but under the new ar
rangement the most valuable man,
he who is the best all-around sports
man in the judgment of the coaches,
will be selected. This change has
been made in accordance with the
(vishes of Gene Tunney, Maloney
stated.
Stanford's inter-collegiate boxing
schedule will be released later this
week, but Maloney revealed that a
two-year arrangement with U.C.L.A.
is being scheduled with the possi
bility of the first tournament in the
Bruin pavilion taking place this
quarter. A squad of ten men will
probably be picked to represent the
farm in this encounter.
A fixed date for the all-university
championship will be selected this
week so that the men may sign up
and bouts may be arranged as soon
as possible. The usual medals will
be awarded to the winners, Maloney
said, although three Tunney awards
will be distributed on the new basis.
