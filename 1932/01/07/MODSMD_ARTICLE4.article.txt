Third party talk is back in the political wind in Washington. Unconvinced of their ability to block Mr. j
Hoover's renoniination and dubious over the outlook for an acceptable democratic candidate, the Republican ;
Independents of the Northwest are seriously considering a third party movement. The name of Senator George
W. Norris (center) is that about which third party dismussions mostly revolve. Other names heard are
those of Senators William Borah (left) of Idaho and Hiram Johnson (upper right) of California and Governor
GifTord Pinchot (lower right) of Pennsylvania.
