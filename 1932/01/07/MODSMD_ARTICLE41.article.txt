# SCRAMBLING TWO SPORTS
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
In answer to the question, "Do
football and baseball mix?" I would
most certainly answer "Yes," but if
this way, "Are most football stars
who take a fling at major league
baseball successful?" I would come
back with a hearty "No!''
The two sports can both be easily
entered by any college athlete, as
one comes in the fall, the other in
the spring. Many who are unusually
versatile go from football to basket
ball, then out for the diamond sport
when the basket-shooting season
ends. Albie Booth starred in those
three sports, Barry Wood takes a
fling at hockey in between his foot
ball and his baseball, instead of
basketball. Hundreds of college ath
letes play both sports and do ihem
equally well, too.
But when it comes to the major
leagues, the college grid and dia
mond hero finds it's something else

again. The pitching is a lot harder
to hit, and the finesse in making
double plays or stealing a base or
tagging a runner is lacking. So the
All-American football player, like
Nevers, who pitched for the Browns,
goes back to the minors, or the Ken
Strongs and the Bruce Caldwells
never get up to the major's at all.
(Caldwell is likely to have a trial
this year.)
Jim Thorpe, probably the greatest
of all football players, was a sub
stitute outfielder with the N.Y.
Giants in 1913, '14, '15, '17, '18, and
'19. In part of 19.17 he was with
Cincinnati, and in 1919 he was also

Metropolitan Newspaper Feature Servicc, Inc.

with the Braves. He never was
nearly as good a baseball player as
he had been a football player, and
probably his fame, won on the grid
irons of the East and on the stadium
track and field at Stockholm in the
1912 Olympic games, caused John
McGraw to keep him on the club
roster as a drawing card.
Frankie Frisch and Eddie Collins
were real stars in football at Ford
ham and Columbia, respectively,
but played in the pre-emphasis
period. Ty Cobb, so I have been
told, once ran 85 yards through the
whole Vanderbilt football team in
a practice scrimmage. He had asked

if he might try his skill, and was j
loaned a uniform. P.S.: He made
good!
In "Big Bill" Edwards' book, ;
"Football Days," he tells of "Big i
Six" Christy Mathewson's great in- |
terest and admiration for the pig- j
skin game, and how he always took j
a football with him in the summer- |
time to practice kicking after the!
baseball games were over. Mac An- !
drews of Dartmouth taught Christy !
to kick spirals and drop-kicks andi
he became very proficient at it. Be- ;
sides his 48-yard field goal against j
the Army, Matty once won a pair j
of shoes and a raincoat from the i
Bucknell coach by kicking two field |
goals against Per.n in one game.
"Orvie" Overall, later a star!
pitcher with the Cubs, was captain j
of both the football and baseball
teams at the Univei-sity of Califor- j
nia, and Mickey Cochrane starred j
on the gridiron for Boston Uni- j
versity.

stitute outfielder with the N.Y.
Giants in 1913, '14, '15, '17, '18, and
'19. In part of 19.17 he was with
Cincinnati, and in 1919 he was also

Metropolitan Newspaper Feature Servicc, Inc.

with the Braves. He never was
nearly as good a baseball player as
he had been a football player, and
probably his fame, won on the grid
irons of the East and on the stadium
track and field at Stockholm in the
1912 Olympic games, caused John
McGraw to keep him on the club
roster as a drawing card.
Frankie Frisch and Eddie Collins
were real stars in football at Ford
ham and Columbia, respectively,
but played in the pre-emphasis
period. Ty Cobb, so I have been
told, once ran 85 yards through the
whole Vanderbilt football team in
a practice scrimmage. He had asked

if he might try his skill, and was j
loaned a uniform. P.S.: He made
good!
In "Big Bill" Edwards' book, ;
"Football Days," he tells of "Big i
Six" Christy Mathewson's great in- |
terest and admiration for the pig- j
skin game, and how he always took j
a football with him in the summer- |
time to practice kicking after the!
baseball games were over. Mac An- !
drews of Dartmouth taught Christy !
to kick spirals and drop-kicks andi
he became very proficient at it. Be- ;
sides his 48-yard field goal against j
the Army, Matty once won a pair j
of shoes and a raincoat from the i
Bucknell coach by kicking two field |
goals against Per.n in one game.
"Orvie" Overall, later a star!
pitcher with the Cubs, was captain j
of both the football and baseball
teams at the Univei-sity of Califor- j
nia, and Mickey Cochrane starred j
on the gridiron for Boston Uni- j
versity.

In answer to the question, "Do
football and baseball mix?" I would
most certainly answer "Yes," but if
this way, "Are most football stars
who take a fling at major league
baseball successful?" I would come
back with a hearty "No!''
The two sports can both be easily
entered by any college athlete, as
one comes in the fall, the other in
the spring. Many who are unusually
versatile go from football to basket
ball, then out for the diamond sport
when the basket-shooting season
ends. Albie Booth starred in those
three sports, Barry Wood takes a
fling at hockey in between his foot
ball and his baseball, instead of
basketball. Hundreds of college ath
letes play both sports and do ihem
equally well, too.
But when it comes to the major
leagues, the college grid and dia
mond hero finds it's something else

again. The pitching is a lot harder
to hit, and the finesse in making
double plays or stealing a base or
tagging a runner is lacking. So the
All-American football player, like
Nevers, who pitched for the Browns,
goes back to the minors, or the Ken
Strongs and the Bruce Caldwells
never get up to the major's at all.
(Caldwell is likely to have a trial
this year.)
Jim Thorpe, probably the greatest
of all football players, was a sub
stitute outfielder with the N.Y.
Giants in 1913, '14, '15, '17, '18, and
'19. In part of 19.17 he was with
