# WOMEN WILL HAVE SWIM EXAMINATION IN NEW ROBLE POOL
## 
### 
At a meeting yesterday morning, j
the Department of Physical Educa
tion for Women made a tcnative ar
rangement to give Stanford women
the opportunity to pass the swim
ming tests that are necessary before
anyone can use the now filled Lagu- I
nita. Tiie Roble pool has been j
drained for the winter quarter, but j
the present plans call for refilling j
the pool expressly for the purpose !
of giving the swimming tests.

If the above arrangement is finally |
decided on, the tests will be given !
on two succeeding Saturdays, prob- |
ably starting this week. In order to
be allowed to canoe on Lagunita, j
Stanford women must swim eight |
lengths of the pool, using any stroke j
or combination of strokes they de- |
sire; they must dive for and recover |
an object from the bottom of the [
pool; and they must swim a short j
distance under water. Mrs. Bolts, !

the women's swimming instructor, j
will be in charge of the tests. All !
women who have previously passed j
the tests are already eligible to use |
the lake.
