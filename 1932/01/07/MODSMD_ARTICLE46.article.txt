# MENLO J.C. VAULTER ENROLLS IN SCHOOL
## 
### 
Adding a very valuable 13 feel
6 inches of pole-vaulting skill to
Stanford track hopes, Bill Miller of
Menlo J.C. celebrated Christmas
by registering in this institution of
higher education and pole-vaulters.
While attending San Diego High
School Miller broke the world's
interscholastic record in his favorite
event when he climed a slender
bamboo pole to the dizzy height of
13 feet 2 inches. Miller will be eli
gible for track this spring, and has
two years of competition before
him. He has already vaulted 13 feet
6 inches this year, and there is a
chance that the meeting between
Miller and Graber of U.S.C. will re
sult in a new world's mark.

Noise overloads the nation's an
nual payroll by $375,000,000.
