DINK TEMPLETON has no idea
of relenting from his announced
stand that he would enter no Stan
ford men in the 1.C.4-A. that have
a chance of competing in the Olym
pic Games. That is, unless the meet,
scheduled for July 8 and 9 at
Berkeley, is moved back to the
Fourth of July week-end, so as not
to interfere with the Olympic trials
to be held here July 15 and 16.

"Monahan, the graduate manager
over at Berkeley, seems to think
we're bluffing," Dink declared yes
terday. "He's sitting tight and hop
ing things will work themselves
out."

But the only way they will "work
out" as f'ai as Stanford is concerned
is for the meet to be held some
other time than just a week before
the Olympic trials.

The Hables brothers, Ben East
man, Jones, and possibly several
others would be kept out of the
intercollegiate meet, according to
the Stanford chief of staff.
■* * *
IN CASE the date is changed, Ben
Eastman would probably compete
in both the 440 and 880, Templeton
indicated yesterday, but would
have to confine himself to one event
in the Olympics besides the 1600-
meter relay.

Templeton was propped up in
bed at his home on Lasuen street
when interviewed yesterday. He has
been confined there for the last two
months with an attack of bursitis.
While he is now on the road to re
covery from the painful malady, it
will be some time yet before he will
be around again.

| A STANFORD MAN may yet fill j
the football coaching post at San
! Francisco University, left vacant by I
, the resignation of Jimmy Needles.
The name of Ernie Nevers is the j
latest to be connected with the posi- I

I tion by Dame Rumor, while Spud
, Lewis, now an assistant at North
western, has also been rumored
under consideration.
One of the most persistent of the
whisperings concerning the vacancy
has it that Nibs Price would accept
if the salary were right.
i And speaking of S.F.U., it is en
j tirely possible that the Dons will be
on the Stanford grid schedule next
fall, filling the date left open by the
postponement of the Northwestern
game,
THE DETROIT TIGERS will
train in Palo Alto on March 1 to 7
! this spring in preparation for ex
hibition contests with Bay Region
teams. The Palo Alto baseball plant
j will be completely revamped for

their stay here, if it will not inter

I tion by Dame Rumor, while Spud

has it that Nibs Price would accept
if the salary were right.

DINK TEMPLETON has no idea
of relenting from his announced
stand that he would enter no Stan
ford men in the 1.C.4-A. that have
a chance of competing in the Olym
pic Games. That is, unless the meet,
scheduled for July 8 and 9 at
Berkeley, is moved back to the
Fourth of July week-end, so as not
to interfere with the Olympic trials
to be held here July 15 and 16.

"Monahan, the graduate manager
over at Berkeley, seems to think
we're bluffing," Dink declared yes
terday. "He's sitting tight and hop
ing things will work themselves
out."

But the only way they will "work
out" as f'ai as Stanford is concerned
is for the meet to be held some
other time than just a week before
the Olympic trials.

The Hables brothers, Ben East
man, Jones, and possibly several
others would be kept out of the
intercollegiate meet, according to
the Stanford chief of staff.

IN CASE the date is changed, Ben
Eastman would probably compete
in both the 440 and 880, Templeton
indicated yesterday, but would
have to confine himself to one event
in the Olympics besides the 1600-
meter relay.

Templeton was propped up in
bed at his home on Lasuen street
when interviewed yesterday. He has
