# INTRAMURAL HOOP SEASON PROMISES HOT COMPETITION
## Basketball Title Defended By Sigma Chi As 34 Squads Sign Up 
### 
Boasting a second-day sign-up of
34 teams, only four short of last
year's final total, and including all
ol' last year's league winners, in
tramural basketball promises to get
off to a good start at the opening
tippofT next Tuesday night.
Entries close this afternoon at 5:!<0
o'clock, according to Gene Mires, in
tramural manager, and the leagues
and schedules will be drawn up im
mediately. Intramural representa
tives are requested to copy their
organizations schedule from the bul
letin board in Encina gym as soon
as the drawings are announced.
As in the mural football just fin
ished, the Sigma Chis are the de
fending champions, and are figured
to have a fast quintet again this
year. They will get plenty of com
petition from most of last year's
league winners as well as fiom ag
gregations which are quietly shedd
ing "dark horses" from the glare of
publicity until the season gets well
under way. It is rumored that the
Theta Delta Chi outfit is grooming
one of these to give the fans a few
unexpected thrills.
Delta Chi will have another small
but fast five, ?md the Business
School, evidently with last season's
success in mind, has enteied two
teams this time. The Phi Sigs, un
doubtedly featuring the speedy
Wardwells, ought to be up near the
top when the final returns come in.
