## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (JP)—Moral
responsibility for every American
dollar lost in foreign bond invest
ments was charged against the State
Department today by Senator Glass
of Virginia.

His vehement utterance was
evoked by testimony before the Sen
ate Finance Committee that a pri
vate loan of $23,000,000 to Bolivia,
now in default, had been approved
by the Commerce Department for
diplomatic reasons. .

Grosvenor M. Jones, chief of the
finance and investment division of
that department, told the commit
tee he "reluctantly" gave his con
sent to tho loan, which was secured
by bonds, when the State Depart
ment said "it might result in em
barrassment if we turn it down."
Loan to Colombia

In addition, Jones told of a $20,-
000,000 short term loan to Colombia
in 1930 after his department had
published a bulletin indicating that
country was borrowing too much.

His testimony was given in the
committee's investigation of the
flotation of foreign securities in this
country, intended to determine its
extent and whether there is an or
ganized movement for cancellation
of European war debts to the United
States.

Glass, who was Secretary of the
Treasury under Woodrow Wilson

recalled the Senate had passed a
resolution sponsored by him calling
upon the State Department to de
sist from passing upon foreign loans.
Denies Legal Right
Asserting the department had no
legal right to such action, the Vir
ginian said:

"The State Department is mor
ally responsible for every dollar lost
lost by Americans in foreign bonds
and every indebtedness that will not
be paid.
They had a clerk passing on them
that didn't know any more about
them than my cat."

"There isn't a scratch of the pen
in the law or constitution that au
thorizes the department to have any
thing to do with these loans.
Studies Conditions
Jones told the committee his divi
sion studies the financial conditions
in foreign countries in great detail.

"On this particular Bolivian loan,"
he said, "I remember very distinctly
talking with Arthur Young or Fred
crick Livesey at the State Depart
ment, and telling them that we
' thought that Bolivia was borrowing
i too much in this market.

"There was a good deal of hem
i ming and hawing, and the upshot of
it was that we reluctantly gave our
: consent to it, for the reason that
at that particular time our diplo
matic relations with Latin America
i were a little upset."

Studies Conditions
Jones told the committee his divi
sion studies the financial conditions
in foreign countries in great detail.

"On this particular Bolivian loan,"
he said, "I remember very distinctly
talking with Arthur Young or Fred
crick Livesey at the State Depart
ment, and telling them that we
' thought that Bolivia was borrowing
i too much in this market.

"There was a good deal of hem
i ming and hawing, and the upshot of
it was that we reluctantly gave our
: consent to it, for the reason that
at that particular time our diplo
matic relations with Latin America
i were a little upset."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (JP)—Moral
responsibility for every American
dollar lost in foreign bond invest
ments was charged against the State
Department today by Senator Glass
of Virginia.

His vehement utterance was
evoked by testimony before the Sen
ate Finance Committee that a pri
vate loan of $23,000,000 to Bolivia,
now in default, had been approved
by the Commerce Department for
diplomatic reasons. .

Grosvenor M. Jones, chief of the
finance and investment division of
that department, told the commit
tee he "reluctantly" gave his con
sent to tho loan, which was secured
by bonds, when the State Depart
ment said "it might result in em
barrassment if we turn it down."
Loan to Colombia

In addition, Jones told of a $20,-
000,000 short term loan to Colombia
in 1930 after his department had
published a bulletin indicating that
country was borrowing too much.

His testimony was given in the
committee's investigation of the
flotation of foreign securities in this
country, intended to determine its
extent and whether there is an or
ganized movement for cancellation
of European war debts to the United
States.

Glass, who was Secretary of the
Treasury under Woodrow Wilson

recalled the Senate had passed a
resolution sponsored by him calling
upon the State Department to de
sist from passing upon foreign loans.
Denies Legal Right

legal right to such action, the Vir
