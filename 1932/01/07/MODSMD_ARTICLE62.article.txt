in Europe all the kings lined up to
be painted and their crowns got
rusted while they waited. I've got 1
six halos—all but one are Out to- 1
day. I painted Abe Lincoln with a ;
clean shave. President Hoover '
waited all night in the rain for me.
In Italy Mussolini waited all day
to shake my hand, and then held
me till the Pope could get up the
aisle to kiss it.
By this time his hearers had be

the great artist Pape.
"Why the Emperor of China j
crawled on his knees through 800 j
miles of tunnel to see me. Would I j
paint him? NO! I had to have three
orders, so he crawled back after
two friends. Lindbergh flunked out
of Wisconsin waiting in line for J
me. I tried to make a mistake and j
