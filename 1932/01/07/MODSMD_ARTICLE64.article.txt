Gifted actors from Shakespeare's j
own Warwickshire will enact nine j
of the Bard's immortal plays at the j
Columbia Theatre in San Francisco j

The Stratford-upon-Avon Shakes- I
peare Festival Company is from the
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre of
; England. This organization, unique i
in the world of the theatre, operates
under a royal charter and is under i
the patronage of the king. Their en- !
gagement in San Francisco will last !
three weeks. This is their third .
transatlantic tour.
This company handles character
izations differently than do other
producers. There are no big stars
in the company: all the members
are stars. Thus all the minor parts
are filled by skilled actors.
It is the policy of the Stratford
players to present some of the more
obscure plays along with the more
familiar ones. The engagement will
begin with the production of "A
Winter's Tale." Then will follow
"King Lear," Tuesday evening; "As
j You Like It," Wednesday matinee;
"The Taming of the Shrew," Wed
j nesday evening; "King Henry the
; Fourth" (Part one), Thursday eve
ning; "The Merry Wives of Wind
sor," Friday evening; "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream," Saturday mati
| nee, and "Twelfth Night," Saturday
| evening.
j The second week will begin with
I the raiely acted "Measure for Meas
| ure."
