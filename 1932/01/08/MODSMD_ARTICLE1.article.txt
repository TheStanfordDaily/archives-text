# INDIAN ELEVEN PLAYS DONS AT KEZAR SEPT. 24
## Rumor Quelled As Warner Reported Certain To Accept New Offer NOT OFFICIAL AS YET Stadium Seats Replaced At $ 101,000 Cost 
### 
San Francisco University will be
on Stanford's football schedule next
season for the first time in history,
the Board of Athletic Control de
cided it J . its regular monthly meet
ing last night.
Kezar Stadium, in San Francisco,
will be the scene of the battle and
September 24, 1932, the date, the
Board decreed after the faculty ath
letic committee had approved the
game. The contest will be the sec- !
ond on the Indians' 1932 schedule; j
they open the season a week earlier I
against Ihe Olympic Club.
However, the Board withheld of- j
ficial sanction of the reappointment j
to the position of head coach of
Glenn "Pop"' Warner, but it was |
definitely announced that he has j
been offered the appointment, and :
that ho is virtually certain to ac
cept. The only reason for not mak- j
ing the appointment last night was j
the l fact that it was not necessarily |
scheduled to come before the Board |
at that time; it had been brought to I
public attention by a San Francisco J
sports writer this week.
Following the lack of official ac
tion on Warner's case, the Board
also declined to make any official I
move on the reported interchange j
of positions by Backfield Coach j
Chuck Winterburn and Freshman j
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw, choosing â– 
to w-ut until Warner's reappoint- j
ment has been made official.
The Board approved an expendi
ture of approximately $101,000 to j
replace the seats in' the stadium,
work to begin sometime in March.
New steel sills and pedestals, with
wooden seats and floorboards, will j
be installed.
