## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7 (/P).—
State officials at Sacramento were
indignant last night when word was
received that a so-called publicity
stunt to advertise Mono lake had
caused rescue operations to be
staged to save 500 "marooned resi
dents of Mono lake district," who
did not want to be rescued.
A rescue caterpillar, with a sled
trailer, after an all-night trip from
Benton, plunged through drifts,
many of them twenty-five feet high,
into Mono lake basin yesterday, to
relieve the suffering humanity
trapped there, only to find no suf
fering humanity, and the people
living there, not in any danger.
In a conversation with State high
way officials, over a long distance
telephone from Mono lake, Super
visor Jacob A. Mattley of Mono
county, branded the "suffering" of
Mono lake residents a lot of "pub
licity hooey."
