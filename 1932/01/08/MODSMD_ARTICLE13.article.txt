# U. S. FLAYS JAP ARMY ADVANCE
## America To Lead Powers In Treaty Invocation 
### 
! WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. (/P)â€”Re
! peated American protests against
j Japanese occupation of Manchuria
j were capped today by a direct noti
| fication that the United States
I would stand on its rights under in
ternational agreements, including
the nine-power treaty and the Kel
logg-Briand pact against war.
A note was dispatched to Tokyo
; reaffirming the American position
! in the face of continuing Japanese
| operations which now have virtu-
I ally completed the conquest of the
I Manchurian provinces.
Officials Taciturn
Officials would not discuss the
I subject. They declined for the time
being even to speculate on the steps
which may be possible now that
Washington has taken the lead
among the powers toward an in
vocation of the treaties considered
applicable.
I The nine-power treaty, negoti
ated at the Washington arms con
ference in 1922, pledged the nations
having interests in the Far East to
"respect the sovereignty, fhe inde
! pendence, and the territorial integ-
I rity of China."
Pledge Signers
Those who signed that pledge, in
I addition to China, were the United
j States, Japan, Great Britain, France,
i Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands,
! and Portugal. Five other nations
i have since adhered to this treaty.
The Kellogg-Briand pact, to
j which Japan along with most of the
! other nations of the world are sig
' natory, renounces war "as an in
j strument of national policy."
