# JAPAN'S NAVAL STRENGTH HELD THREAT TO U. S.
## Adams, Hale In Favor Of Building Fleet To Pact Limit 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. (/P) — A i
| Japanese sea force growing more
i rapidly than either the American
| or British navies was cited today by
' Chairman Hale of the Senate Naval
i Committee as a reason for building j
J the United States fleet up to treaty i
1 limits.
j In addition, the committee heard
I Secretary Adams of the Navy De
! partment say it was "extremely
j doubtful" that actual cash for new ,
naval construction would be sought |
at this session.
Guarded in his remarks, Adams j
said he could not officially approve
Hale's bill for a treaty limit navy j
for the reason 'that President j
Hoover and the budget bureau had |
not yet had opportunity to give j
their views on it.
His previous personal indorse- '
• ment of a similar measure before j
j a House committee brought a i
i Democratic suggestion that he i
i ought to resign because his views |
! differed from those of the President. I
Although withholding specific ap- j
' proval, Adams said smilingly that 1
| he could not '"wholly dissent from I
j the view" expressed by Hale that |
! adoption of a construction program |
' at this time would increase Ameri- j
j can bargaining power at the Geneva ,
| disarmament conference next month. !
