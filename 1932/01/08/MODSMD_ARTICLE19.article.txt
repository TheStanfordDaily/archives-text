Islands where live cannibals and |
! head-hunters . . .
i Monkeys which eat crabs . . .
: Bats which eat coconuts . . .
A village where the drinking-wa-
I ter is obtained from wells sunk in
' the graveyard . .• .
People who eat only fish in a land
where game is plentiful . . .
i Chieftains who have women of
1 every race, white, yellow, brown,
! and black, in their harems . . .
These are a few of the curious
i things seen by Dr. Albert W. Herre, •
I curator of the Stanford Museum, I
> during his 65,000 miles of travel, ex
! tending over a period of years, in j
the islands of Oceania. He recently
returned from a trip which began
| last spring to the Philippine Islands j
and Sulu Archipelago.
Dr. Herre lived with the natives, j
collecting fish and observing the
j habits of the practically unknown 1
i people. He admitted that he had
caught "many rare species of fish [

j not found in any collections in Eu
j rope or America."
From Zamboango in the southern j
Philippines he went into the moun- '
tains of the interior, where he visited j
an old friend, the native ruler of a j
large territory.
In comparing civilization in these
regions with that in the West, Dr. '
Herre said that "Life in a village j
i iike Sibutu flows oh evenly without j
rush or worry and demonstrates that !
much of our alleged progress and 1
• complex civilization is either un- ,
I necessary or else leads nowhere. '
There are no factories or stores,
hotels or restaurants, streets or law- j
i yers, newspapers or movies, police I
or clergy, bridge parties or country '
| clubs or any of the other concomi- j
I tants of modern city life.
I "There is no booze problem, for :
j the Korean forbids alcoholics and [
| Mohammedans apparently live up j
i to their religious precepts better!
[ than do Christians."
