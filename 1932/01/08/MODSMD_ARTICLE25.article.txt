LOS ANGELES, Calif., Jan. 7.—
; Fourteen Bruin varsity basketball
j players along with coaches Caddy
i Works and Wilbur Johns will leave i
j tonight for Palo Alto where the j
j Westwood team faces the strong j
j Indian varsity in the initial contest (
| of the 1932 basketball season.
The U.C.L.A. contingent is headed |
j by Captain Tricky Dick Linthicum, j
j all-Coast forward for two years. ;
! Linthicum has not hit his stride as j
yet this season in the scoring de- j
partment and Bruin fans are ex- ;
pecting him to open up in the two j
game series this week-end. The
j Westwood leader is performing in j
| the ccnter berth this season.
Forwards Good
j The forward positions are being j
| handled quite capably by two up;
| and coming sophomores by the i
' names of Don Piper and Bud Rose, j
I Piper, who is a Los Angeles junior j
! college transfer, gives promise of t
! developing into a first rate perform- I
I er before the season is over. Ross, '
I who was one of the high lights of I
j last year's freshman five, jumps
j center for the Bruins.
j Bill Maxwell, captain and star for
i ward on the yearling aggregation j
| last season, is giving his sophomore j
| teammate plenty of trouble and may
| start the series in Rose's place, j
! Maxwell played one of the end po- |
|sitions on the football team last fall
j and was late in reporting for the
I team on account.
Lemcke Main Cog
j Works has not as yet hit upon a
i guard combination that strikes his
! liking. Ted Lemcke is holding down
! Frank I.ubin's position in great style
| and is the main clog in the Bruin
! defense. George Brotemarkle, a fast,
| but light junior will in all proba
bility start the contest in the re
maining guard position.
In their practice schedule, the
j Bruins have beaten the strong Los
j Angeles athletic club five, Holly
wood A.C., Whittier College, and
Utah Slate. The Bruins dropped
tilts to the Pasadena Majors, and two
games to Utah State.

LOS ANGELES, Calif., Jan. 7.—
; Fourteen Bruin varsity basketball
j players along with coaches Caddy
i Works and Wilbur Johns will leave i
j tonight for Palo Alto where the j
j Westwood team faces the strong j
j Indian varsity in the initial contest (
| of the 1932 basketball season.
The U.C.L.A. contingent is headed |
j by Captain Tricky Dick Linthicum, j
j all-Coast forward for two years. ;
! Linthicum has not hit his stride as j
yet this season in the scoring de- j
partment and Bruin fans are ex- ;
pecting him to open up in the two j
game series this week-end. The
j Westwood leader is performing in j
| the ccnter berth this season.
Forwards Good
j The forward positions are being j
| handled quite capably by two up;
| and coming sophomores by the i
' names of Don Piper and Bud Rose, j
I Piper, who is a Los Angeles junior j
! college transfer, gives promise of t
! developing into a first rate perform- I
I er before the season is over. Ross, '
I who was one of the high lights of I
j last year's freshman five, jumps
j center for the Bruins.
j Bill Maxwell, captain and star for
i ward on the yearling aggregation j
| last season, is giving his sophomore j
| teammate plenty of trouble and may
| start the series in Rose's place, j
! Maxwell played one of the end po- |
|sitions on the football team last fall
j and was late in reporting for the
I team on account.
Lemcke Main Cog
j Works has not as yet hit upon a
i guard combination that strikes his
! liking. Ted Lemcke is holding down
! Frank I.ubin's position in great style
| and is the main clog in the Bruin
! defense. George Brotemarkle, a fast,
| but light junior will in all proba
bility start the contest in the re
maining guard position.
