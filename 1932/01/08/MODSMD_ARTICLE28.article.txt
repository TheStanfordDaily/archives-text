# Cards To Face Uclan Invaders On Even Terms
## Same Five Beginning in Santa Clara Game Scheduled To Start Tonight Against U.C.L.A. Bruins When 8 o'Clock Whistle Sounds WESTWOOD SQUAD ARRIVES THIS MORNING All Squad Positions Remain Open to Competition, According to Coach John Bunn 
### DICK RODDA 
the same five that started the Santa Clara game, Corilry, LaCombe,
Packard, Norgard, and Baker, the Stanford cage .squad will open the
1 1932 conference basketball season here tonight against the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
The Indian squad under Joiin Bunn has steadily improved since the
; first practice game early in the Christmas vacation and should take the
floor with an even chance to conquer the Wcstwooders. Last year the
Bruins won two of the three games played, Stanford taking llie last one
hy one point.
"We have a much better chance of defeating U.C.L.A. than we did last
i year," said Bunn last night before practice. "The squad is playing more
intelligently and may be able to stop the early scoring power usually
displayed by the Bruins."
However, there is really nothing upon which to say that either Stanford
or U.C.L.A. has a chance to cop tonight's opener. Both teams are made up
j of new men and neither has played teams as yet upon which a com-

• parison can be based, which means
I that two unknown quantities will
■ face each other as the first whistle
j blows fit 8 o'clock tonight in the
| Stanford Pavilion.
Lineup Announced
j Although Bunn announced the
! same lineup that started against
j Santa Clara last Monday night, it
j is by no means certain that this is
! the regular five. According to Bunn
there is still t a fight for every posi
; tion on the squad, and especially
I among the guards there is keen
j competition for berths.
At present Norgard and Baker
■ have had the edge, but Rintala,
Schnetka, Tod, and Eldon are still
to be heard from.
In the forward department Meade
j and Palmer will alternate with
j either Cordry or LaCombe. The
] former pair will probably see uc-
I tion tonight. At center Dave Pack
! ard has been used mostly because
j of his ability to control the tip-off.
i However, Bill Doub has lately dem-
I onstrated some of his last year's
i form and will undoubtedly be
! called upon against the Bruins. An
j other possibility at center is Jen
kins, who reported for practice last
! night for the first time this year.
{ Jenkins showed great promise dur
! infT"~the fall practice; last year he
i held down a guard position on the
; i frosh team.
i Bruins Due on Lark
> ; The Westwood squad with Coach
I "Caddy" Works will arrive on the
•' Lark this morning. Led by their

I the Bruins present a strong scoring

: | run up huge scores against Los An
> geles A C., Hollywood A.C., and
j Whitticr, but - lost two games to
the Utah Aggies when Linthicum
' | was apparently in a scoring slump.
