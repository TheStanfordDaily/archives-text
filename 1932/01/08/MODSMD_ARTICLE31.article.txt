# THE 						HOUNDS ARE LOOSE AGAIN
## 
### 
Stanford's £iiin iiiil Hare and Hounds farce, "with
.strangely compliant Hares, begins tomorrow at noon. In
short, women's rushing is here again, and it is now open
season on nuggets.
Reams *uid reams have been written about Ihe ridicu
lous aspects of this Iragi-cotiiedy and there is nothing new
to say about it now. Pan-Hellenic has tried to make the
most of an impossible situation; the results have not been
encouraging. There will be just as many back-stabbings,
vicious double-crossings and bitter disappointments as
there have been in Ihe past, and the women will love it.
So be it.
However, the Dau.v at this lime takes the liberty of re
printing an article which appeared in the Daily of Jan
uary 17, 192!), the day after pledging. It was written by
Winston Norman, one-time Chaparral editor, who was at
that period conducting Ihe Hull Session. It created a furor
among the Five Hundred, and roused a flock of comments,
most of them disparaging.
Nevertheless, * the Daily thinks it will do no harm to
give freshman women a chance to read the article now. It
will give them one side of the picture, at least. Not that
the Dau.v subscribes to Norman's belief that sororities at
Stanford should be abolished. They are a necessary part
of campus life, but the evils attendant upon the rushing
season at Stanford make it something to horrify the inno
cent freshman woman. Read, children, and learn.
"This is a day of broken hearts. Roble Hall is full of
them.
"The last returns are in, and yesterday numerous young
ladies wept tears of joy as, entering their future Stanford
homes amidst general osculation, they were greeted as
pledges bv the Sisterhoods.
"Hut many another young lady, in Ihe darkness of her
room al Roble, wept tears of bitterness last night, knowing
at last that her dream, of many years was shattered, that
she would never wear the cherished Pin, that the Roble
Bastille would be her home throughout her Stanford days.
"A few, a very few, stay in Roble because they want to.
Some stay because I hey would have only one Pin and no
other, and it was not offered to them. Others stay —just
because. Next year some of them will not come back. They
will take their broken Pearls somewhere else. The rest
will return, philosophical, apathetic or defiant.
"This morning, between the roommate who pledged
and the roommate who did not, the relationship is some
how different; and as weeks pass Ihe gulf will widen. The
new sister-to-be will he dropping up to the House for lunch,
and there will be the flurry of affairs and, finally, initiation.
Their college worlds will be different.
"Stanford is supposedly famous for its democracy.
Among the men this is true. But it is absolutely impossible
for Stanford women to be democratic, even though they
may wish to be, under the present Roble-or-Row situation.
"There is a definite boundary line between the sorori
ties and Roble, whereas there is no such demarcation be
tween the fraternities and Ihe halls. A Stanford man is
judged by his fellows for himself alone, regardless of where
lie chooses to live. A great percentage of men living in the
halls or in Palo Alio are there in preference to Ihe Row.
There are some, of course, who were disappointed at rush
ing time; but Ihe man who did not join a fraternity, al-
Ihough wishing to do so, can explain it by saying, 'I didn't
want lo go Row.'
"The disappointed woman can't use Ibis alibi. As some
one has said, 'It's easier lo pledge a sorority than to spend
all your time explaining why you didn't.' And even when
she does explain, though she. may have sincere convictions
against going Row, are her reasons believed?
"In one way, sororities are a benefit: they provide small
living groups which allow half of the women at Stanford
to escape the repressive boredom of four years in Roble.
Rut there will be no decent democracy among Stanford
women until there are small living units for Ihe entire
Five Hundred and with Ihe Creek letters rubbed off Ihe
doorsteps.
"In other words, sororities al Stanford should he
abolished."
