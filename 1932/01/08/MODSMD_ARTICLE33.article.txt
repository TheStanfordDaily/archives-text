# BULL SESSION

### 
Advertising is a fair indication of
the level of the people's intelligence.
And the grade of advertising that
has characterized cigarettes recent
ly registers a new low. We once
made a solemn vow that we would
never touch a coffin nail whose
popularity depended on exploited
feminine beauty. Now, however,
"Bull Durham" (adv.) is the sole ma
jor tobacco that we know of that
has not sought to turn fair creatures
into increased sales. And if some
day we wake up to find Clara Bow
in a bathing suit astride the famous
"Bull," all will be lost in blackness
and abject despair.
Why the masses should buy cig
arettes —a thing that is supposed to
appeal to the taste —because a thing
that appeals to the eye is splattered

what kind of cars we will drive, and
i everything but what kind of air
j we shall breathe. It is about time
j that the politicians got busy. Why
J not use the movie stars to aid party
j causes? For instance, if some queen
!of the celluloid firmament should

j ray's mustache better than any
; other in Ihe Democratic party, it
'is very difficult to see how the
Murray-for-President bubble could
! not become an overflowing bowl of
I thick suds.
Everybody likes a pretty face and
' a trim figure but why must the
j world be placarded with them?
