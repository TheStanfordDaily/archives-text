The Editor, Sir:
Every student who attends a con
cert in the Pavilion or who attends
a play ot a recital in the Assembly
Hall knows the need of a new Thea
tre on the campus for such pre
sentations. The problem is to raise
the funds to build such a theatre.
The Chappie has raised a fund of
several thousand dollars. What
other steps have been taken toward
such a fund, I do not know. But 1
should like to present a plan that
may or may not be practical for a
part of such fund.
Until this quarter one dollar a
quarter of each undergraduate stu
dent's tuition and community fee
went to help pay for the present
basketball pavilion. Now that the
student's share of the basketball
pavilion has been paid for by the
Pavilion Fee, why not take this one
dollar a quarter and put it into a
Theatre Fee? The sum of money

I so raised each year from such a fee
would, I suppose, approximately
; equal $8,000. If the graduate stu
: dents as well as the undergraduates
' were assessed this amount, the sum
i would be greater. Of course this
$8,000-$lO.OOO would not pay the in
terest on the total amount necessary
to build such a theatre, but if the
! students showed a desire for a thea
-1 tre through such a fee, additional
1 funds may come from some other
' sources. Therefore, 1 suggest the
j beginning as soon as possible, a
Theatre Fee similar to the Pavilion
be established. The amount col
lected now would pay off some of
the principal when the theatre is
i finally started.
May 1 even suggest that each stu
; dent be assessed $2.00 a quarter by
j raising the tuition fee from $99 or
1 $114 to an even $100 or $115.
