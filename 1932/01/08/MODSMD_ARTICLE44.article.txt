We gathered statistics on the old j
alumns of our class in high school!
this vacation. The results were dis- j
ccuraging. Forty-seven marriages
(the class was not a large one), and !
fifty-three babies, and nineteen di- I
vorces.
The class beauty is working in a \
circulating library and is thirty-five I
pounds heavier.

We listened to our head of the
family explain for hours on end !
how Tulane really outplayed j
S.C. We talked about the Dart
mouth game, strictly.

We listened to endless prognosti
cations—political and financial—on
1932. The aforementioned head of
the family asked us: "Do you know
what will happen if Hooverism
keeps up for another year? You
don't? Why, Mahatma Ghandi will
be the best-dressed man in Amer
ica." And we had to laugh and
laugh and laugh.

Two far-removed cousins of the
family (whom life had passed by)
came to our fireside to partake in
some Christmas revelry. And so wo
told them about what went on at
college. And they said "MMMIIHH,
tell us some more."

We went to a party where
there were eight students home
from Cal, and seventeen stu
dents home from S.C. We had
such a lovely time.

We had found out just before we i
came home that a "nearly of the I
past" friend of ours was mailing a j
Christmas present home to us. So!
we rushed up town and battled |
through vicious hordes of day-be- [
fore-Christmas shoppers, and bought '
a charming, charming gift for our I
friend, and sent it air-mail, special j
delivery. We congratulated our-'
selves 011 pulling out of that one;
pretty well, and then waited for our j
package, which we were so sure j
was on its way. It never came. Pe- j
culiar. But we got a writing set i
from some one to whom we sent a I
Christmas card.

Wo had a friend whose case
was sadder though. In the exig
encies of circumstances he had
been forced to sell his car. Two
zealous pals—his best and clos
est in fact—sent him driving
gloves. Handsome pigskin ones,
too.

SYDNEY, Jan. 7. (/P) —It is not;
likely that there will be a rush, for
the new tattooed socks, which need j
no darning or washing and do not j
even come off at night. The fashion j
was created in Sydney recently by j
a bachelor, maddened by eternal j
darning. j

fifty-three babies, and nineteen di- I
vorces.
The class beauty is working in a \
circulating library and is thirty-five I
pounds heavier.

We listened to our head of the
family explain for hours on end !
how Tulane really outplayed j
S.C. We talked about the Dart
mouth game, strictly.

We listened to endless prognosti
cations—political and financial—on
1932. The aforementioned head of
the family asked us: "Do you know
what will happen if Hooverism
keeps up for another year? You
don't? Why, Mahatma Ghandi will
be the best-dressed man in Amer
ica." And we had to laugh and
laugh and laugh.

Two far-removed cousins of the
family (whom life had passed by)
came to our fireside to partake in
some Christmas revelry. And so wo
told them about what went on at
college. And they said "MMMIIHH,
tell us some more."

We went to a party where
there were eight students home
from Cal, and seventeen stu
dents home from S.C. We had
such a lovely time.

We had found out just before we i
came home that a "nearly of the I
past" friend of ours was mailing a j
Christmas present home to us. So!
we rushed up town and battled |
through vicious hordes of day-be- [
fore-Christmas shoppers, and bought '
a charming, charming gift for our I
friend, and sent it air-mail, special j
delivery. We congratulated our-'
selves 011 pulling out of that one;
pretty well, and then waited for our j
package, which we were so sure j
was on its way. It never came. Pe- j
culiar. But we got a writing set i
from some one to whom we sent a I
Christmas card.

Wo had a friend whose case
was sadder though. In the exig
encies of circumstances he had
been forced to sell his car. Two
zealous pals—his best and clos
est in fact—sent him driving
gloves. Handsome pigskin ones,
too.

SYDNEY, Jan. 7. (/P) —It is not;
likely that there will be a rush, for
the new tattooed socks, which need j
no darning or washing and do not j
even come off at night. The fashion j
was created in Sydney recently by j
a bachelor, maddened by eternal j
darning. j
We gathered statistics on the old j
alumns of our class in high school!
this vacation. The results were dis- j
ccuraging. Forty-seven marriages
(the class was not a large one), and !
fifty-three babies, and nineteen di- I
vorces.
