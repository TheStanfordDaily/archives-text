TIIRILL SEASON is here.
While football furnishes its great moments—individual thrills which
no other sport can approach—basketball stands rlone for sheer excitement.
Only ice hockey can supply as steady a stream of thrills from opening
whistle to final gun as the cage game.
The Stanford-U.C.L.A. series, opening the conference schedule at the
Pavilion tonic,ht, gives promise of developing even more than its share of
heart trouble. It all started last year, when John Bunn was starting his
first season as head of Indian basketball affairs. After showing consider
able promise in practice games, the Farm live went South to tackle the
Bruins in the first conference games. The opener was a rout —for part of
the first half. Sixteen points the Indians spotted the Westwooders before
swinging into action, and then it was too late. But once under way, the
Bum charges outplayed the Uclans and almost overtook them.
The next night, the Stanford lads let the Bruins pile up 10 points to
none at all just torn ake things interesting. Again they came to life, eating
away at that big margin until the final minute of play saw the Indians
leading by a single point. But again the start had been too late, for a lanky
fellow by the name of Linthicum got hold of the ball, and with only
seconds to play, heaved it half the length of the court for the winning
basket.

Tin: TWO TEAMS started in where they had left off when
they met for the third and last game of llie series at Stanford a
month later. Again the Indians spotted the Southern five a big
lead—!l points this time. And again they set out in a desperate
attempt to catch up. Mofl'att and Fawcett, both of whom are lost
to the team this year by graduation, found their stride in the
second half, after the Bruins had run up a 21-to-10 score.
But as the Farm quintet overcame that lead and the invaders
saw the game slipping away from them, they again settled down
to the serious business of making goals. The lead see-sawed back
and forth several times, while a capacity crowd very nearly tore
the Pavilion (o pieces in its frenzy. After the Indians were ap
parently beaten by' three points, Meade and Fawcett sank two
goals to win the hectic affair in the c losing seconds, leaving some
.'l,OOO limp fans to trickle wonderingly out of the building.
The football squads carried on the tradition last fall, when
an apparent six-to-six tie was broken up in the last nine seconds,
the famous Allen-to-Colvin combination giving Stanford the win
ning touchdown.

SUCH IS THE HERITAGE of the series opening tonight. Both institu
tions have lost players from last season's teams, but both have developed
.strong men to take their places. "Frenehy" LaCombe has come along to
replace .Captain Mike Reynolds, while Schnetka, Tod, Norgard, and Baker
furrgsh ample strength at the guard positions, along with Rudy Rintala,
who was teamed with the stellar Fawcett last year.
While not looking brilliant in the early-season experimental period,
the Indians now appear ready for the conference struggle.
"We are in a much better position to win the U.C.L.A. series this year
than last," Coach John Bunn declared last night. "But, of course, that's
not saying we will," he hastened to add. "You never can tell about that
Bruin bunch. When they get a scoring streak started, there seems to be
only one way to stop them, and that's to call time out. At least they can't
score during that minute!"

ANOTHER SERIES will open tomorrow niglil down at Los
Angeles which will l>e watched with interest. California, favorite
lo capture another title race, will meet the U.S.C. five at Olympic
Auditorium on Saturday and Monday nights.
The Bears are big favorites, hut the Trojans should at least
give the Nibs Price contingent a real test of their power. Kintana,
Read, and Vendt of last year's championship combination all re
ported back to Price this season. Kintana and Read were the high
scorers of the team, while Vendt was a strong running mate for
Coffield, the Bears' all-coast guard.
To round out this team, Price has Ted Ohashi, Japanese star, to
pair with Kintana at forward, and Burns to replace Coffield at
guard. And not the least of his assets is Hal EifTert, freshman flash
of a year ago who appeared one of the best forward prospects on
(lie coast. He helped defeat the Indian yearlings on one occasion
with his wrist in a cast.
The Trojans did not show great power on the Christmas barn
storming tour of the Middlewest, while prt-ss reports from the
South indicate that further smoothing up is necessary before they
will be at maximum strength. Los Angeles writers are moaning
because the I'.S.C. five has to face the Bears right at the start of
the season.

7vIENT.O JUNIOR COLLEGE is the sourcc of not a little of Stanford's
strength in all branches of sport.
Right at present, "Frenchy" LaCombe stands at the head of the list
of athletes "Dud" DeGroot has sent to the Farm from the Menlo institu
tion. LaCombe was a star in both gridiron and basketball court at Menlo,
and has already proved a lifesaver to Coach Bunn's team, with Moffatt
deciding to graduate insfead of returning for another year of competition.
He saw some service under "Pop" Warner this year, his first at Stanford,
and can be expected to play some considerable football before he is
graduated.
Al Norgard, Jay Tod, and Jack Cosgrove are other Indian cagers who
came to Stanford by way of Menlo, the former pair also needing no intro
duction on the gridiron.
"Chuck" Ehi horn, Gordy Campbell, "Swede" Dawson, and Phil Neil,
all of football note, were also Menlo men, while in the other branches of
athletic affairs we are indebted to DeGroot and staff for Bill Miller in
track, Harry Plymire and Jack Cosgrove in tennis, Carl von Saltza and
Jim Benet in swimming, Hellman in golf, Meiggs in soccer, Keenan in
boxing, and Campbell, Ehnnan, and Stark in baseball.
DeGroot was himself a Stanford athlete of note, having been gradu
ated in 1923. jyj £

attempt to catch up. Mofl'att and Fawcett, both of whom are lost
to the team this year by graduation, found their stride in the
second half, after the Bruins had run up a 21-to-10 score.
But as the Farm quintet overcame that lead and the invaders
saw the game slipping away from them, they again settled down
to the serious business of making goals. The lead see-sawed back
and forth several times, while a capacity crowd very nearly tore
the Pavilion (o pieces in its frenzy. After the Indians were ap
parently beaten by' three points, Meade and Fawcett sank two
goals to win the hectic affair in the c losing seconds, leaving some
.'l,OOO limp fans to trickle wonderingly out of the building.
The football squads carried on the tradition last fall, when
an apparent six-to-six tie was broken up in the last nine seconds,
the famous Allen-to-Colvin combination giving Stanford the win
ning touchdown.

SUCH IS THE HERITAGE of the series opening tonight. Both institu
tions have lost players from last season's teams, but both have developed
.strong men to take their places. "Frenehy" LaCombe has come along to
replace .Captain Mike Reynolds, while Schnetka, Tod, Norgard, and Baker
furrgsh ample strength at the guard positions, along with Rudy Rintala,
who was teamed with the stellar Fawcett last year.
While not looking brilliant in the early-season experimental period,
the Indians now appear ready for the conference struggle.
"We are in a much better position to win the U.C.L.A. series this year
than last," Coach John Bunn declared last night. "But, of course, that's
not saying we will," he hastened to add. "You never can tell about that
Bruin bunch. When they get a scoring streak started, there seems to be
only one way to stop them, and that's to call time out. At least they can't
score during that minute!"

ANOTHER SERIES will open tomorrow niglil down at Los
Angeles which will l>e watched with interest. California, favorite
lo capture another title race, will meet the U.S.C. five at Olympic
Auditorium on Saturday and Monday nights.
The Bears are big favorites, hut the Trojans should at least
give the Nibs Price contingent a real test of their power. Kintana,
Read, and Vendt of last year's championship combination all re
ported back to Price this season. Kintana and Read were the high
scorers of the team, while Vendt was a strong running mate for
Coffield, the Bears' all-coast guard.
To round out this team, Price has Ted Ohashi, Japanese star, to
pair with Kintana at forward, and Burns to replace Coffield at
guard. And not the least of his assets is Hal EifTert, freshman flash
of a year ago who appeared one of the best forward prospects on
(lie coast. He helped defeat the Indian yearlings on one occasion
with his wrist in a cast.
The Trojans did not show great power on the Christmas barn
storming tour of the Middlewest, while prt-ss reports from the
South indicate that further smoothing up is necessary before they
will be at maximum strength. Los Angeles writers are moaning
because the I'.S.C. five has to face the Bears right at the start of
the season.

7vIENT.O JUNIOR COLLEGE is the sourcc of not a little of Stanford's
strength in all branches of sport.
Right at present, "Frenchy" LaCombe stands at the head of the list
of athletes "Dud" DeGroot has sent to the Farm from the Menlo institu
tion. LaCombe was a star in both gridiron and basketball court at Menlo,
and has already proved a lifesaver to Coach Bunn's team, with Moffatt
deciding to graduate insfead of returning for another year of competition.
He saw some service under "Pop" Warner this year, his first at Stanford,
and can be expected to play some considerable football before he is
graduated.
Al Norgard, Jay Tod, and Jack Cosgrove are other Indian cagers who
came to Stanford by way of Menlo, the former pair also needing no intro
duction on the gridiron.
"Chuck" Ehi horn, Gordy Campbell, "Swede" Dawson, and Phil Neil,
all of football note, were also Menlo men, while in the other branches of
athletic affairs we are indebted to DeGroot and staff for Bill Miller in
track, Harry Plymire and Jack Cosgrove in tennis, Carl von Saltza and
Jim Benet in swimming, Hellman in golf, Meiggs in soccer, Keenan in
boxing, and Campbell, Ehnnan, and Stark in baseball.

The Stanford-U.C.L.A. series, opening the conference schedule at the
Pavilion tonic,ht, gives promise of developing even more than its share of
heart trouble. It all started last year, when John Bunn was starting his
first season as head of Indian basketball affairs. After showing consider
able promise in practice games, the Farm live went South to tackle the
Bruins in the first conference games. The opener was a rout —for part of
the first half. Sixteen points the Indians spotted the Westwooders before
swinging into action, and then it was too late. But once under way, the
Bum charges outplayed the Uclans and almost overtook them.
The next night, the Stanford lads let the Bruins pile up 10 points to
none at all just torn ake things interesting. Again they came to life, eating
away at that big margin until the final minute of play saw the Indians
leading by a single point. But again the start had been too late, for a lanky
fellow by the name of Linthicum got hold of the ball, and with only
seconds to play, heaved it half the length of the court for the winning
basket.

"We are in a much better position to win the U.C.L.A. series this year
than last," Coach John Bunn declared last night. "But, of course, that's
not saying we will," he hastened to add. "You never can tell about that
Bruin bunch. When they get a scoring streak started, there seems to be
only one way to stop them, and that's to call time out. At least they can't
score during that minute!"

ANOTHER SERIES will open tomorrow niglil down at Los

The Bears are big favorites, hut the Trojans should at least
give the Nibs Price contingent a real test of their power. Kintana,
Read, and Vendt of last year's championship combination all re
ported back to Price this season. Kintana and Read were the high
scorers of the team, while Vendt was a strong running mate for
Coffield, the Bears' all-coast guard.
To round out this team, Price has Ted Ohashi, Japanese star, to
pair with Kintana at forward, and Burns to replace Coffield at
guard. And not the least of his assets is Hal EifTert, freshman flash
of a year ago who appeared one of the best forward prospects on
(lie coast. He helped defeat the Indian yearlings on one occasion
with his wrist in a cast.
The Trojans did not show great power on the Christmas barn
storming tour of the Middlewest, while prt-ss reports from the
South indicate that further smoothing up is necessary before they
will be at maximum strength. Los Angeles writers are moaning
because the I'.S.C. five has to face the Bears right at the start of
the season.

7vIENT.O JUNIOR COLLEGE is the sourcc of not a little of Stanford's
strength in all branches of sport.
Right at present, "Frenchy" LaCombe stands at the head of the list
of athletes "Dud" DeGroot has sent to the Farm from the Menlo institu
tion. LaCombe was a star in both gridiron and basketball court at Menlo,
and has already proved a lifesaver to Coach Bunn's team, with Moffatt
deciding to graduate insfead of returning for another year of competition.
He saw some service under "Pop" Warner this year, his first at Stanford,
and can be expected to play some considerable football before he is
graduated.
Al Norgard, Jay Tod, and Jack Cosgrove are other Indian cagers who
came to Stanford by way of Menlo, the former pair also needing no intro
duction on the gridiron.
"Chuck" Ehi horn, Gordy Campbell, "Swede" Dawson, and Phil Neil,
all of football note, were also Menlo men, while in the other branches of
athletic affairs we are indebted to DeGroot and staff for Bill Miller in
track, Harry Plymire and Jack Cosgrove in tennis, Carl von Saltza and
Jim Benet in swimming, Hellman in golf, Meiggs in soccer, Keenan in
boxing, and Campbell, Ehnnan, and Stark in baseball.

TIIRILL SEASON is here.
While football furnishes its great moments—individual thrills which
no other sport can approach—basketball stands rlone for sheer excitement.
Only ice hockey can supply as steady a stream of thrills from opening
whistle to final gun as the cage game.
The Stanford-U.C.L.A. series, opening the conference schedule at the
Pavilion tonic,ht, gives promise of developing even more than its share of
heart trouble. It all started last year, when John Bunn was starting his
first season as head of Indian basketball affairs. After showing consider
able promise in practice games, the Farm live went South to tackle the
Bruins in the first conference games. The opener was a rout —for part of
the first half. Sixteen points the Indians spotted the Westwooders before
swinging into action, and then it was too late. But once under way, the
Bum charges outplayed the Uclans and almost overtook them.
The next night, the Stanford lads let the Bruins pile up 10 points to
none at all just torn ake things interesting. Again they came to life, eating
away at that big margin until the final minute of play saw the Indians
leading by a single point. But again the start had been too late, for a lanky
fellow by the name of Linthicum got hold of the ball, and with only
seconds to play, heaved it half the length of the court for the winning
basket.

Tin: TWO TEAMS started in where they had left off when
they met for the third and last game of llie series at Stanford a
month later. Again the Indians spotted the Southern five a big
lead—!l points this time. And again they set out in a desperate
attempt to catch up. Mofl'att and Fawcett, both of whom are lost
to the team this year by graduation, found their stride in the
second half, after the Bruins had run up a 21-to-10 score.
But as the Farm quintet overcame that lead and the invaders
saw the game slipping away from them, they again settled down
to the serious business of making goals. The lead see-sawed back
and forth several times, while a capacity crowd very nearly tore
the Pavilion (o pieces in its frenzy. After the Indians were ap
parently beaten by' three points, Meade and Fawcett sank two
goals to win the hectic affair in the c losing seconds, leaving some
.'l,OOO limp fans to trickle wonderingly out of the building.
The football squads carried on the tradition last fall, when
an apparent six-to-six tie was broken up in the last nine seconds,
the famous Allen-to-Colvin combination giving Stanford the win
ning touchdown.

SUCH IS THE HERITAGE of the series opening tonight. Both institu
tions have lost players from last season's teams, but both have developed
.strong men to take their places. "Frenehy" LaCombe has come along to
replace .Captain Mike Reynolds, while Schnetka, Tod, Norgard, and Baker
furrgsh ample strength at the guard positions, along with Rudy Rintala,
who was teamed with the stellar Fawcett last year.

the Indians now appear ready for the conference struggle.

South indicate that further smoothing up is necessary before they
will be at maximum strength. Los Angeles writers are moaning
because the I'.S.C. five has to face the Bears right at the start of
the season.

7vIENT.O JUNIOR COLLEGE is the sourcc of not a little of Stanford's
strength in all branches of sport.
Right at present, "Frenchy" LaCombe stands at the head of the list
of athletes "Dud" DeGroot has sent to the Farm from the Menlo institu
tion. LaCombe was a star in both gridiron and basketball court at Menlo,
and has already proved a lifesaver to Coach Bunn's team, with Moffatt
deciding to graduate insfead of returning for another year of competition.
He saw some service under "Pop" Warner this year, his first at Stanford,
and can be expected to play some considerable football before he is
graduated.
Al Norgard, Jay Tod, and Jack Cosgrove are other Indian cagers who
came to Stanford by way of Menlo, the former pair also needing no intro
duction on the gridiron.
"Chuck" Ehi horn, Gordy Campbell, "Swede" Dawson, and Phil Neil,
all of football note, were also Menlo men, while in the other branches of
athletic affairs we are indebted to DeGroot and staff for Bill Miller in
track, Harry Plymire and Jack Cosgrove in tennis, Carl von Saltza and
Jim Benet in swimming, Hellman in golf, Meiggs in soccer, Keenan in
boxing, and Campbell, Ehnnan, and Stark in baseball.
DeGroot was himself a Stanford athlete of note, having been gradu
ated in 1923. jyj £
