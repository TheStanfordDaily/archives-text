### 
j BALTIMORE, Jan. 7 (TP). â€”Gover-
| nor Albert C. Ritchie, for many
j years spoken of as a possible Dcmo
j cratic presidential nominee, tonight
j for the first time openly spoke of
j himself as a candidate for that
; honor.
Delivering himself of a scathing
i denunciation of what he called the
j "Republican evasion, inaction and
| blundering in Washington," he de
| clared he "would be proud" to carry
j the banner of Democracy to victory
j in the elections next November.
