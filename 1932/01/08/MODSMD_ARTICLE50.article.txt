# Frosh Face Paly High Today In Opener
## YEARLINGS READY FOR TOUGH GAME WITH PREPSTERS Contest Set For 4 o'Clock In Pavilion; Fawcett Names Starters 
### 
Stanford's freshman hoopsters
will make their first appearance of
the season at 4 o'clock this after- I
noon in the Pavilion against the j
strong Palo Alto High School Vik- !
ings.
The prepsters already have a good |
pre-season record of six wins out I
of eight starts, and Coach Vance '
Fawee'l's yearlings are greatly han- j
dicapped by a lack of experience, |
so the contest promises to be a j
tough one.
The game will see two unusually j
small teams on the court. "Dud" |
Sales, Indian center, will have a j
hard time taking the tip-oIT away !
from the even smaller Harry Cordes. j
Mallatratt, a new guard for the j
freshmen, will give "Hod" Ray's •
two crack guards, Joe Woods and
Dick Misenhimer, a lot of' competi
tion, in spite of his size.
Shooting Poor
The yearling quintet, drilled in
the varsity style of play, is sadly j
lacking in accuracy, both in passing |
and shooting, although the plays go i
off with remarkable speed at times. !
The frosh will have their second j
game tomorrow afternoon with j
Pittsburg high, and Fawcett will i
probably have a chance to do some j
experimenting with his line-up, j
since ihat team is considered much ;
weaker than the.Palo Alto aggrega- !
tion.
Lineups Named
In today's game, however, the!
yearlings will probably have to de- i
pend a great deal on indivdiual I
player strength, since the high- '
school five is known for its smooth- !
working offense. The Vikings have I
defeated the freshmen for the last j
two years.
