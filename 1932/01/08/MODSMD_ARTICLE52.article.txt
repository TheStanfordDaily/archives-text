# OLDEST SPORT EVENT
## Athletes From All Parts of World to Gather This Summer In Los Angeles for Tenth Olympiad 
### Feg Murray, '16 
With Ihc new year comes the;
tenth Olympiad, with its winter!
sports at Lake Placid, N.Y., in Feb
ruary, i.nd the other events at Los j
Angeles in July and August. The
United States will not have to send j
an expeditionary force abroad to
these games, for the first time since
1904, when they were held in St.
Louis, but with each country limit- .
ed to three men in each event the '
U.S.A. will not have the numerical
superiority it had 28 years ago. 1
Everyone concerned is hoping that
Old Man D. Pression will be a thing I
of the past by the time next sum- j
mer rolls around, so that there will
be no worries over the number of >
European athletes—or spectators J
either, to attend the games.
The word "Olympiad" really!
means the four-year period between
the ancient Greek Olympics, but ii (
is now commonly used in reference j
to the games themselves. I suppose j
I should have pictured a jumper of I
some sort instead of the discus j
thrower above. Why should I have,
drawn a broad-jumper or a high- j
jumper, you ask? Because 1932 is
Leap Year, that's why! But, serious- j

ly speaking, the "Discobus," or dis
cus thrower, by Myron, a sth Cen
tury Athenian sculptor, is typical
of the games themselves in its
strength and grace, so I have pic
tured it coming up over the horizon
with the dav/n of 1932, the year in
which the tenth of the modern
Olympics will be held.
Probably no other regular sport
ing event arouses -the world-wide :
interest that these games do, nor I
are there any other competitions I
with such a historic background, j
The first Olympic games were held ;
in the sacred stadium at Olympia, ,
Greece, in the year 776 8.C., and !
these meetings continued for a !
thousand years. They were the j
greatest unifying force in the es- j
sentially Greek period of world his- !
tory, but were finally abolished by j
the Romans near the end of the i
third century, A.D.
Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a!
Frenchman, conceived the idea, in
1892, of revising the ancient Olym
pics, and with the greatest difficulty
finally put his idea over. So, at
Athens, in 189(5. the first of the mod- j
ern games was brilliantly launched. !

means the four-year period between
the ancient Greek Olympics, but ii (
is now commonly used in reference j

I should have pictured a jumper of I

thrower above. Why should I have,
drawn a broad-jumper or a high- j
jumper, you ask? Because 1932 is
Leap Year, that's why! But, serious- j

ly speaking, the "Discobus," or dis
cus thrower, by Myron, a sth Cen
tury Athenian sculptor, is typical
of the games themselves in its
strength and grace, so I have pic
tured it coming up over the horizon
with the dav/n of 1932, the year in
which the tenth of the modern
Olympics will be held.

The first Olympic games were held ;
in the sacred stadium at Olympia, ,
Greece, in the year 776 8.C., and !
these meetings continued for a !
thousand years. They were the j
greatest unifying force in the es- j
sentially Greek period of world his- !
tory, but were finally abolished by j
the Romans near the end of the i
third century, A.D.
Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a!
Frenchman, conceived the idea, in
1892, of revising the ancient Olym
pics, and with the greatest difficulty
finally put his idea over. So, at
Athens, in 189(5. the first of the mod- j
ern games was brilliantly launched. !

With Ihc new year comes the;
tenth Olympiad, with its winter!
sports at Lake Placid, N.Y., in Feb
ruary, i.nd the other events at Los j
Angeles in July and August. The
United States will not have to send j
an expeditionary force abroad to
these games, for the first time since
1904, when they were held in St.
Louis, but with each country limit- .
ed to three men in each event the '
U.S.A. will not have the numerical
superiority it had 28 years ago. 1
Everyone concerned is hoping that
Old Man D. Pression will be a thing I
of the past by the time next sum- j
mer rolls around, so that there will
