# "BEAT WASHINGTON" IS GOAL FOR RIVAL QUINTETS OF NORTH
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Jan. 7. (JP)â€”'The bat
tle cry of "beat Washington" was
heard in Oregon, Idaho, and Wash
ington today as four of the five
teams in the northern division of
the Pacific Coast Conference pre
pared to open the 19u2 basketball
season tomorrow night.
For four consecutive seasons
Washington has romped off with
the northern division championship
and last year added the Pacific Coast
title to its accomplishments by con
quering the University of California
in a plaj'off series.
Beating the Huskies this year will
likely be a tougher assignment than
last season as Coach "Hoc" Ed
mundson is well fortified with vet
erans. John Fuller and Kline Swy
gards are back at the forward posts
and Ned Nelson and Captain Ralph
Cairney are holding down the guard
positions again. Pete Antoncich, a
G-foot 5-inch center, has succeeded
Henry Swanson who was graduated.
Antoncich transferred to Washing
ton from the University of Alabama
a year ago.
