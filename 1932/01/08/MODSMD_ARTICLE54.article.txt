# 440 RELAY TRACK IN MURAL PRELIMS SET FOR WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Preliminaries in the quarter-mile |
and the relay for next Friday's in- j
; tramural track meet will be held j
lon Wednesday afternoon at 4:15 !
j o'clock on the old oval. It has been j
; found necessary to hold qualifying l
j trials in these two events because j
• of the unexpectedly large number '
] of entries. All 440 men and all re- j
| lay teams that signed up at the I
! regular preliminaries held last j
| quarter are eligible for Wednesday's j
trials.
The successful qualifiers in the •
| events in which preliminaries were ■
! held last month will alone be al- i
| lowed to compete in those events, as j
| the entire qualifying meet will not,
| be run again. j
