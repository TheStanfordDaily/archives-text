# RETURN OF AUSTIN AND STORMS ADDS TO OVAL CHANCES
## Famous High-jumper And Distance Man Show Up At Practice 
### Dick Strouse 
Hopes of one of the best Indian
track seasons of all time received a
big boost this week when it was
learned that Spencer Austin and A1
Storms have enrolled in Stanford
(his quarter. The addition of these
two men and Bill Miller, pole vault
expert, gives Templeton the possi
bility of turning out one of the
best balanced of all his great track
teams.
Austin is the high-jumper who,
two years ago while a freshman at
Stanford, made the famous Stewart
of U.S.C., then competing for the
Olympic Club, jump six feet four
inches to defeat him. In that meet,
Austin injured his leg and has been
out of competition ever since. He
reported to Bill Ellington yesterday
afternoon, however, and proved his
contention that he is in fine shape
by clearing five feet six inches with
ease.
May Take U.S.C.
If Austin can reach or surpass
his own best mark of six feet three
inches this season, the entire aspect
of the U.S.C.-Stanford meet will be
changed, as, before the addition of
Austin to the Indian squad, there
was more than a slight chance of a
Trojan sweep in the high-jump.
Storms has been a member of the
Stanford track team for the past
two seasons, but did not expect to
return this year. However, A1 will
be ready this spring to do his bit
toward helping the Eastmans, Ful
lenwider, Atkinson, Ferrie, Aeber
sold, and Azevedo garner points in
the dislanee races.
Clara Bow Helps
Storms has been working out at
Malibu Beach, the noted play
ground of the movie colony. Ac
cording to his own testimony, both
Ed Kennedy of the 1931 track team,
and Clara Bow have been assisting
him in getting in shape.
In accordance with Dink Temple
ton's theory of working his men
hard in the fall and spring and
comparatively easily in between,
the next month's track practice will
be light. It is Templeton's belief
that the best way to get a runner
in shape is to let him reach his peak
early, hold him there, and then add
a bit more speed each week during
the regular season. Partly because
there is no practice meet tomorrow
and partly just to show that loafing
is out of fashion even during the
winter quarter,' Ellington had the
men run progressive relays yester
day afternoon.

of the U.S.C.-Stanford meet will be
changed, as, before the addition of
Austin to the Indian squad, there
was more than a slight chance of a
Trojan sweep in the high-jump.
Storms has been a member of the
Stanford track team for the past
two seasons, but did not expect to
return this year. However, A1 will
be ready this spring to do his bit
toward helping the Eastmans, Ful
lenwider, Atkinson, Ferrie, Aeber
sold, and Azevedo garner points in
the dislanee races.
Clara Bow Helps
Storms has been working out at
Malibu Beach, the noted play
ground of the movie colony. Ac
cording to his own testimony, both
Ed Kennedy of the 1931 track team,
and Clara Bow have been assisting
him in getting in shape.
In accordance with Dink Temple
ton's theory of working his men
hard in the fall and spring and
comparatively easily in between,
the next month's track practice will
be light. It is Templeton's belief
that the best way to get a runner
in shape is to let him reach his peak
early, hold him there, and then add
a bit more speed each week during
the regular season. Partly because
there is no practice meet tomorrow
and partly just to show that loafing
is out of fashion even during the
winter quarter,' Ellington had the
men run progressive relays yester
day afternoon.
Hopes of one of the best Indian
track seasons of all time received a
big boost this week when it was
learned that Spencer Austin and A1
Storms have enrolled in Stanford
(his quarter. The addition of these
two men and Bill Miller, pole vault
expert, gives Templeton the possi
bility of turning out one of the
best balanced of all his great track
teams.
Austin is the high-jumper who,
two years ago while a freshman at
Stanford, made the famous Stewart
of U.S.C., then competing for the
Olympic Club, jump six feet four
inches to defeat him. In that meet,
Austin injured his leg and has been
out of competition ever since. He
reported to Bill Ellington yesterday
afternoon, however, and proved his
contention that he is in fine shape
by clearing five feet six inches with
ease.
May Take U.S.C.
If Austin can reach or surpass
his own best mark of six feet three
inches this season, the entire aspect
of the U.S.C.-Stanford meet will be
changed, as, before the addition of
Austin to the Indian squad, there
was more than a slight chance of a
Trojan sweep in the high-jump.
