# WOLTER SELECTS FIRST LINEUPS IN DRIVE FOR TITLE
## Trautman Is Possibility At Third; Card Coach Optimistic 
### Bob Wade 
Driving his charges through the
first strenuous practice of the quar
ter lust night, Coach Harry Wolter
began to build the 1932 edition of
the Cardinal nine by uncovering a
possible "find" to fill in the gap at
third base left when Dykes John
son graduated.
The new prospect is none other
than Jerry Trautman, one of the
stars of last year's undefeated fresh
man golf squad. Wolter had him
working out at third base or a pre
liminary first string, along with
Hearn at first, Triplett at second,
Delmas at short, and Livermore and
Fessio alternating behind the plale.
As a tentative second string Wol
ter tried Woodworth and Goodell at
first, Philippi at second, Gabriel at
third, and Schauf and Massey be
hind the bat.
The return of Joe Fessio, who
played on the yearling team four
years ago. strengthens the receiv
ing department considerably, but
he will have to show a lot of class
to beat out Ike Livermore, from last
year's league-winning outfit. Massey
caught Stan Anderson's scuthpaw
slants, for the freshmen last year,
and may be able to edge in this
year. ,
"The outfield -looks particularly
pleasing," declared Coach Wolter,
"and no one has a position cinched
just because he played last year.
That goes for the infield as well.
Judging by the material on hand
there should be an even stronger
team this year than the one that
won the championship last spring."
