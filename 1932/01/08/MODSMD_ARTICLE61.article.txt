# UNIVERSITY PRESS PUBLISHES RECORD OF HOOVER'S WORK
## Detailed Accounts Of War Transactions Written 
### Co-Authors 
Including comprehensive and de
tailed accounts of all the transac
tions of the various relief organiza
tions which operated under Herbert
Hoover during and after the World
War, a huge volume of 1033 large
pases which the Stanford Univer
sity Press has just completed was
issued for sale yesterday. The book,
"American Food in the World War
and Reconstruction Period," is by
Frank M. Surface and Raymond L.
Bland.
Detailed expenditures from 1914
to 1921 amounting to nearly five
and a quarter billion dollars and
the delivery to Europe of 33,841,307
tons of commodities composed main
ly of American food and some
clothing and medical supplies which
are set forth are the result of four
years of research by the authors.
Tables and supplementary texts
offered include answers to all ques
tions regarding the material aspects
of the activities of the American
Food Administration, the American
Relief Administration, the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, and the
other organizations through which
the United States carried aid to
Europe during the critical period.
Capable Authors
Both authors were well equipped
for the work they have just com
pleted. Frank Surface was statisti
cian of the Food Administration and
aided Hoover in the Supreme Eco
nomic Council in Paris. Bland
stayed with the American Relief
Administration from the beginning
to the end of its activities as statis
tician.
Bland came to Stanford early in
1927 for a period to work on the
files here, after getting work'for the
volume under way in Washington.
In 1929 both Surface and Bland re
turned to the Farm and the latter
remained until the work was com
pleted.
Records Scattered
The records of U.S. government
expenditures from which the au
thors gathered that part of their
data are preserved in government
buildings in Washington. Other
documents are preserved in various
archives, part of them in the Hoover
War Library here. An interesting
fact shown by these records is that
less than 7 per cent of the total
amount expended in European re
lief is chargeable to "benevolence,"
more than 93 per cent being ac
counted for under "cash and bar
ter" or "credit."
Thorough presentation is made
possible by the care with which ac
counts were kept from the begin
ning of the relief period in 1914.
Even under the pressure of urgent
emergency work in getting food and
supplies to suffering communities in
the shortest possible time, detailed
records were kept of every ton from
the moment of its purchase to its
passing out of the hands of the
American organization.

Detailed expenditures from 1914
to 1921 amounting to nearly five
and a quarter billion dollars and
the delivery to Europe of 33,841,307
tons of commodities composed main
ly of American food and some
clothing and medical supplies which
are set forth are the result of four
years of research by the authors.
Tables and supplementary texts
offered include answers to all ques
tions regarding the material aspects
of the activities of the American
Food Administration, the American
Relief Administration, the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, and the
other organizations through which
the United States carried aid to
Europe during the critical period.
Capable Authors
Both authors were well equipped
for the work they have just com
pleted. Frank Surface was statisti
cian of the Food Administration and
aided Hoover in the Supreme Eco
nomic Council in Paris. Bland
stayed with the American Relief
Administration from the beginning
to the end of its activities as statis
tician.
Bland came to Stanford early in
1927 for a period to work on the
files here, after getting work'for the
volume under way in Washington.
In 1929 both Surface and Bland re
turned to the Farm and the latter
remained until the work was com
pleted.
Records Scattered
The records of U.S. government
expenditures from which the au
thors gathered that part of their
data are preserved in government
buildings in Washington. Other
documents are preserved in various
archives, part of them in the Hoover
War Library here. An interesting
fact shown by these records is that
less than 7 per cent of the total
amount expended in European re
lief is chargeable to "benevolence,"
more than 93 per cent being ac
counted for under "cash and bar
ter" or "credit."
Thorough presentation is made
possible by the care with which ac
counts were kept from the begin
ning of the relief period in 1914.
Even under the pressure of urgent
emergency work in getting food and
supplies to suffering communities in
the shortest possible time, detailed
records were kept of every ton from
the moment of its purchase to its
passing out of the hands of the
American organization.
Including comprehensive and de
tailed accounts of all the transac
tions of the various relief organiza
tions which operated under Herbert
Hoover during and after the World
War, a huge volume of 1033 large
pases which the Stanford Univer
sity Press has just completed was
issued for sale yesterday. The book,
"American Food in the World War
and Reconstruction Period," is by
Frank M. Surface and Raymond L.
Bland.
