THE STANFORD DAILY
For the College Year
Send it home to your folks instead of
writing a four-page letter every day.
Maybe your chum back home would
like to know what Stanford is doing.
Give them all a chance to find out
what Stanford is really like by sending
them the Daily during the remainder
of the school year.
CALL AT THE DAILY OFFICE NEXT TO THE PRESS
BUILDING AND PLACE YOUR HOME ADDRESS ON
OUR MAILING LIST OR SEND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
TO
THE STANFORD DAILY
