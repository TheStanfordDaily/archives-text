### 
!
Jan. 10. I/I'iâ€”Reaction abroad to Chancellor Heinrich Bruen
ing's declaration that Germany could not pay reparations any longer
was termed "an attempt lo torpedo the Lausanne Conference" by a
foreign office spokesman today. The foreign office emphatically insisted
the Chancellor in his recent talk with the British ambassador and his i
published interview later, never spoke of Germans wanting or not wanting
to pay reparations. ."Matters are entirely beyond Germany's will and
it is now merely a question of Germany's utter impossibility to pay,"
the spokesman said.

Foreign office circles professed to
see in the London, Paris, and War- J
saw versions of Bruening's talk with
Sir Horace Rumbold, the British '
envoy, "an attempt to torpedo the |
Lausanne Conference before the
conference ever assembled."
The versions published in the
three foreign capitals were looked
upon here as indicating the Chan
cellor expressed himself to the
British ambassador more sharply
than he actually did.
On the other hand, it was believed I
Chancellor Bruening welcomed the
opportunity to tell the world and
especially the German people that
he would not sign any document at
Lausanne, seat, of the international
reparations conference tentatively
set for the latter part, of the month,
which involved further financial
reparation obligations on Germany's
part.
