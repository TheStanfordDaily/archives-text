campaign being carried on at Wash
ington, Filipino leaders today
guarded comment on President
Hoover': - , nomination of Theodore
Roosevelt to be Governor General
of the Philippines.
President Manuel Quezon of the
Insular Seriate declined to makr a
statement. Roosevelt is so little
known here he has been confused
in the minds of the less informed,
with Nicholas Roosevelt, whose
nomination for the Vice Governor
generalship in 1029 proved so un
popular. At that time a book writ
ton by Nicholas Roosevelt was pub
licly burned as an expression of
public feeling.
