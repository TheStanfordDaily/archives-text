### 
PEIPING, China, Jan. 10. (/P)
Secretary of Stale Stimson's recent
note on the Sino-Japane.se conflict
was variously described in the
Chinese press today as having "the
head of a dragon but the tail of a
rat" and as locking the door after
the "thief walked off with the
jewels."
On the other hand, former For
eign Minister Wellington Koo re
ferred to the note as a "statesman
like move characteristic of the
great peace-loving nation which has
been the sponsor of the anti-war
pact, the founder of the policy of
the open door and of the upholding
of the territorial and administrative
integrity of Chinaâ€”policies which
find their solemn confirmation in
the Nine-Power Treaty, to which
Japan is likewise a party."
