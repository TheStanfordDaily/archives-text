# DIMMITT CHOSEN FOR 'ALICE' PART
## Ruhland Isaly Gets Place As Gerald Arnwood 
### 
Harold Helvenston, director of
Stanford Dramatics, chose Beulah
Dimmilt at last Friday's rehearsal
to play (ho part of Alice Greenleaf
in tho next campus production,
"Bird in Hand."
For the part of Gerald Arnwood,
which occurs only in tho third act,
Ruhland Isaly was selected. Isaly
will be remembered for his part,
Sholto, in tho "Young Idea." Only
one part is left to bo chosen in the
third act, that of Sir Robert Arn
wood.
All the roles arc strikingly dif
ferent and present a rare opportun
ity for creative work, the part of
Alice being especially important.
The only other feminine role is that
of Joan Greenleaf which is to be
taken by Virginia Wilson. James
Sandoc will do the comedy interest
in the role of Mr. Blanquct, sardine
salesman. James Lyons will act
Cyril Beverley.
Helvenston has cast "Bird In
Hand" extremely slowly so as to be
sure that everyone is chosen cor
rectly. ' Bird In Hand" by John
Drinkwaler is well known, and pre
sents a definite problem in casting.
"Bird In Hand" will be presented
to the campus on the night of Janu
ary 29.
