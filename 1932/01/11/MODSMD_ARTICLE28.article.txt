### Lowell Cox 
1 A small package of dynamite ex
i ploded in the Pavilion Saturday
| night, and when the smoke had
I cleared away, the scoreboard read
I Stanford 31, U.C.L.A. 2(i.
It was "Tiny Tom" Cordry, aided
and abetted by A1 Norgard, who
I caused all the trouble. After the
Indians had won Friday night's
opener by a 25 to 22 count, the
Bruins came back strong tho next
evening to run up a commanding
lead and hold it half way through
the final period.
With the score 2!i to 17 in favor
of the visitors, Norgard sank a free
throw and LaCombe a field goal to
give Stanford a glimmer of hope.
With time growing scarce, the
Bruins attempted to stall their way
to a win, but they reckoned with
out Cordry.
Cordry Starts Drive
Snatching the ball from Soost,
"Tiny Tom" dribbled half the length
of the floor for a basket, and a few
seconds later followed with a long
one to send Stanford into a 24 to ?'•'*
lead. Meanwhile the crowd went
quite crazy.
It was then that Al Norgard en
tered the scene, tossing one in from
j mid-court after the tip-oIT. Piper
j countered with another, but Nor-
I gard sewed up the game with a field
! goal and a free throw.
Just by way of celebration, Cordry
j broke loose for another long dribble
and basket just before the gun
sounded to signal a scries win ovei
the Bruins.
Botli Thrillers
Both games were thrillers. In
Friday night's battle the lead see
sawed back and forth until near the
end of the game, when LaCombe':,
field goal and Packard's free throw
gave the Indians a win. The score
at half time was tied at 14 to 11.
The second tilt started out in the
same manner, but half way through
the first period the visitors went on
a scoring spree to run the score up
to 17 to 11 at half time. Coming
| back fast after the rest period, the
| Westwood five kept the game safely
j in hand and appeared almost cer
! tain winners until Cordry and Nor
j gard ran amuck.
I High point honors went to Cordry
j in the first game, who accounted for
j nine tallies, trailed by LaCombe
j with eight. In Saturday's hectic so;,-
| sion Cordry and LaCombe tied with
I JO points each.
Championship Looms
Rosy dreams of a championship,
although a bit premature, are al
ready being discussed on the earn •
pus. Southern California provided a
sensation Saturday night by upset -
ting California, conference favorite-,
by a 22 to 14 score. The Trojans will
again face the Bears tonight, and
next, week-end will invade the Farm
for a pair of games, after which a
fair idea of the relative strength of
the Stanford and California five ;
should be apparent.
Coach .John Bunn still has some
j rough spots to smooth up, but tho
basketball appears to have "arrived"
on the Farm, and with improvement
as the season progresses, the Indians
should at least be near the top when
the flag race closes.
