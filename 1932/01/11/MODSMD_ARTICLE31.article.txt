In Friday's Daii.y, (Ik 4 editorial column was devoted lo
I lie subject uppermost in the minds of Stanford women:
namely, Women's Rushing. In a subject as vital as this
one, it is imperative that a statement which is in part cx-
Ireme, and which presents but one or two angles of the
case should not be accepted as fairly giving all sides of the
question.
Regardless of what the future holds, this year -seventy
or eighty women will soon face a decision which they
rightfully hold as of deep importance. This decision
should be based on an understanding of the facts— not on
the popular fallacies which are so often unfounded or ex
aggerated. The advantages and disadvantages of the Hall,
and the Row, as applied to the individual woman, are
herein taken up in turn, in order that the new woman may
have a clear and an organized view of the problem in its
entirety:
Each year a large group of women slay in Roble. Some
stay because they do not get a bid or the one they want,
some because their parents objects, many because of the
expense of a sorority, a few because they are members of
a group of friends who do not want to be separated, and
some because they believe the advantages of Roble out
weigh the disadvantages.
For the woman who did not get the bid she wanted and
m some cases for the impoverished lady, there is bound to
be a dose of initial sorrow which we cannot alleviate. Rut
when another rushing season is over and all these women
recognize themselves as members of Roble (Hub, they find
just this:
Roble as a whole is not as closely knit as a sorority. Its
size forbids. To those who like to feel a definite "belong
ing to something" this is a disadvantage. To those others
who like more personal freedom and power to choose their
own friends it is an advantage.
"The Hall woman has no social life" is a remark often
made. She has not as definite a social background as a
sorority woman, it is (rue, and she may not, because of
this, go as often with fraternity men. Yet although the Hall
woman may have fewer opportunities in this line thrown
in her way, yet at bottom Hie big factor is the individual.
In other words, if the woman is a "dating" type, the gentle
men will give her attention, regardless of where she lives.
Jennie Jones may be unpopular. Rut it is not because
she lives in Room .'517 Roble; it is because she is Jennie
Jones, and we regret lo say that Miss Jones would have no
larger a group of intimate friends if she belonged to the
most royal of the Greeks.
Consider the women on the campus who have made
some nanje for themselves in various fields of activity
dramatic, journalistic, literary, political. On this list you
will find that the number from Roble compares favorably
lo the number from the Row. If these women had changed
places at the outset of their career, as regards living groups,
the list would still be much the same. What is tacked after
a woman's name, or what is absent from it, does not inex
orably carve out for her, her successes and disappoint
ments at college.
For college is bigger than sororities, and bigger than
social engagements. And now, when the question of rush
ing tends lo blot out everything else for so many women,
it is wise to keep hold of this truth.

"The Hall woman has no social life" is a remark often
made. She has not as definite a social background as a
sorority woman, it is (rue, and she may not, because of
this, go as often with fraternity men. Yet although the Hall
woman may have fewer opportunities in this line thrown
in her way, yet at bottom Hie big factor is the individual.
In other words, if the woman is a "dating" type, the gentle
men will give her attention, regardless of where she lives.
Jennie Jones may be unpopular. Rut it is not because
she lives in Room .'517 Roble; it is because she is Jennie
Jones, and we regret lo say that Miss Jones would have no
larger a group of intimate friends if she belonged to the
most royal of the Greeks.
Consider the women on the campus who have made
some nanje for themselves in various fields of activity
dramatic, journalistic, literary, political. On this list you
will find that the number from Roble compares favorably
lo the number from the Row. If these women had changed
places at the outset of their career, as regards living groups,
the list would still be much the same. What is tacked after
a woman's name, or what is absent from it, does not inex
orably carve out for her, her successes and disappoint
ments at college.
For college is bigger than sororities, and bigger than
social engagements. And now, when the question of rush
ing tends lo blot out everything else for so many women,
it is wise to keep hold of this truth.
