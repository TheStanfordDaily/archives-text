# ANOTHER DEPRESSION
## 
### 
II is a sorry plight Unit athletics arc in ;i f Iho University
nl Washington. An over-ambitious program of football
has drained the treasury to the detriment of the other
sports, making it necessary to withdraw financial support
in many cases, principally basketball and crew.
1 he tact that more money was spent on football than
was returned has, in addition to the lack of support for
other lines of activity just mentioned, another very serious
asjM'ct: It may be the death knell for big-time football.
.Many statements during the 1931 season have called
attention to the decreasing popularity of football and have
predicted the ultimate loss of the enviable position it now
holds among the college sports. Most publicized of these
predictions was that of Dr. William G. Anderson, athletic
director at Yale University, who drew an analogy between
lootball and the fable of the seven lean years, pointing out
that football has just enjoyed the seven fat years and now
is on the verge of pretty slim pickings.
It would be disastrous in many institutions for football
to fail because anticipated dividends from this source have
been projected into the future in the form of buildings,
improvements in athletic plants, and similar undertakings,
! he resulting debt would be more than could be carried.
