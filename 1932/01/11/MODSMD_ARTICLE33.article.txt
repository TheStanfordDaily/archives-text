# BULL SESSION
## DEMOCRACY LTD.—A GENERAL MOTORS SUBSIDIARY 
### 
The campaign of 1928 marked a
new era for the Democratic Party.
For yeurs they had been trying to
copy Ihe Republican formula for
victory and had practically .suc
ceeded in all but one respect. In
that year, they overcame the last
difference that separated the two
parties. John J. R;iskob turned the
trick. He was able to raise money j
on the same scale as the Repub- 1
licans; that was something new in i
Democratic circles. They had been
accustomed to enter every campaign
without adequate funds. Further
than that, Raskob not only matched j
every Republican contribution—but !
he performed the very common i
business trick of spending more
than he received. This was a genu- ,
inely new wrinkle in politics—when i
conducted on the Raskub style. It ;
left the G.O.P. with their tongues 1
hanging out.
Raskob is a business man in poli
tics, and every time he forgets his
business training, he leads his party |
into politics and away from vie- i
tory. He should organize the Demo
cratic party like another subsidiary !
corporation to General Motors. "Eco- ;
nomical Governmentation" should
be the party slogan; no one can I
argue about that. It v/ill sell Demo
cracy just like a similar slogan sold |
Chevrolets. "It Puys to Vote Demo- I
cratic" should be the battlecry. In
short, take the Democratic Party
out of politics and put it on a busi- j
ness basis—where the Republican
Party has been for years.
At times, Raskob does this very I

i thing. Recently he stated, "Prohibi
! lion is a social issue, and should be
taken out of politics"; that is the
correct attitude. We have a govern
mental problem that will lose votes
!no matter on which side of the
| fence he stands; it is getting darned
; uncomfortable straddling the fence
and trying to keep a foot on both
j sides. The only business thing to do
is to burn the fence entirely or go
and stand some place on the rolling
fields of harmless generalities where
there are no fences. Can you imag
ine Buick taking a stand on the
j farm debenture? Why should we
expect our parties to take stands?
——
At other times, however, Raskob
i forgets business and tries to be a
politician. Every time he does the
; Republicans dance with uncon
-1 cealcd happiness; because every
j lime Raskob forgets his good GM
principles the Democrats lose votes.
Now he is advocating some plan of
stale option as a means of settling
j the prohibition problem. That can
i do nothing but further the inherent
Democratic faculty for disagreeing,
j Of course, some people may think
j that it is more worthy for the Demo
cratic PARTY to go down in de
feat than have Democracy Ltd.—the
high-pressure business corporation—
■ sweep on to victory.
The only difficulty is that Raskob j
I may mix his business and his poli- I
lies and then the Democratic slogan !
for .1932 will be "Ride in a Chevro- j
let —Vote for the Democrats—and I
l Enjoy Both;"
