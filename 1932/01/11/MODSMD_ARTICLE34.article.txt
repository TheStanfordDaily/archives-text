The Editor, Sir: j
Assuredly an article such as Mr. |
Norman's, reprinted in the Friday j
issue of the Daily, can do nothing j
but increase those very "evils at- ;
tendant upon the rushing season." |
You admit you are not using it for ;
it:, anti-sorority cry. Why, then, print ;
a column that gives an exaggerated
and partly false picture of ruin and
that can produce nothing but panic j
in the minds of freshman women? !
No one denies that rushing is a j
chaotic affair; possible lessening of I
that chaos by presenting a construc
tive analysis to aid new women in \
their choice would be more intelli
gent and praiseworthy Daily policy, j
For this year, no matter what the j
future brings, there is a Row and !
a Roble with advantages and disad- j
vantages on the side of each. The !
question is not one of rhetoric but j
of how to help each woman choose j
a congenial living group.
The words "congenial living
group" are, to my mind, the crux ;
upon which each girl's decision must ;
hang. She does not live with the j
national or campus rating of the |
house but with her house sisters.
The sorority in which she is most
at ease, toward whose general in
terests and attitudes she is most
sympathetic, is the one for her.
Sorry is the case of the girl who
selects a house because she is fond
of a few older girls in it. They
graduate and leave; the girl still
has two or three years to live in
the house no matter how barren it
is for her. She must look at the
sophomores in the house and at the
girls being rushed along with her.
For three years she will live con- j
stantly with them.
If the entii-e problem was solved i

| when the girl made her choice,
j there would be little trouble. Sadly,
| the girl and the house under con
j si deration often do not agree.
If the choice finally falls between
j accepting the bid of a house toward
which the girl feels little sympathy
or staying in the Hall, I pray she is
careful about doing the former no
1 matter what the pressure. There are
J individual considerations that might
i sometimes change the case but for
; the majority faced with such a de
l cision Roble offers far the better
i life.
The large group in the Hall, in
; eluding as it does all the new wom
j en as well as the permanent mem
j bers of the Roble Club, assures any
j girl of congenial companions and at
I the same time of making more
! varied contacts than are possible in
! a small, self-selected group,
j Mr. Norman's use of the title
| "Roble Bastile" was and is ridicu
lous. He has evidently never lived
iin Roble. To the contrary, the in
; dependence of dormitory life, both
i as to the comforts of living—includ
| ing such concrete advantages as
j showers, laundry, privacy, and free-
I dom from sophomore duties and
| also as to the opportunity for de
l velopment of individuality is its
j greatest boon.
However, my object is not to sing
the praises of Roble but to try to
lessen the confusion in every
; rushee's mind. If each girl would
j remember that her decision has
i much more to do with the kind of
j woman she wants to be at gradua
! tion than with the shape of pin she
i is going to wear the issue would be
j clearer. —Barbara Boggs

Assuredly an article such as Mr. |
Norman's, reprinted in the Friday j
issue of the Daily, can do nothing j
but increase those very "evils at- ;
tendant upon the rushing season." |
You admit you are not using it for ;
it:, anti-sorority cry. Why, then, print ;
a column that gives an exaggerated
and partly false picture of ruin and
that can produce nothing but panic j
in the minds of freshman women? !
No one denies that rushing is a j
chaotic affair; possible lessening of I
that chaos by presenting a construc
tive analysis to aid new women in \
their choice would be more intelli
gent and praiseworthy Daily policy, j
For this year, no matter what the j
future brings, there is a Row and !
a Roble with advantages and disad- j
vantages on the side of each. The !
question is not one of rhetoric but j
of how to help each woman choose j
a congenial living group.
The words "congenial living
group" are, to my mind, the crux ;
upon which each girl's decision must ;
hang. She does not live with the j
national or campus rating of the |
house but with her house sisters.
The sorority in which she is most
at ease, toward whose general in
terests and attitudes she is most
sympathetic, is the one for her.
Sorry is the case of the girl who
selects a house because she is fond
of a few older girls in it. They
graduate and leave; the girl still
has two or three years to live in
the house no matter how barren it
is for her. She must look at the
sophomores in the house and at the
girls being rushed along with her.
For three years she will live con- j
stantly with them.
If the entii-e problem was solved i

| when the girl made her choice,
j there would be little trouble. Sadly,
| the girl and the house under con
j si deration often do not agree.
If the choice finally falls between
j accepting the bid of a house toward
which the girl feels little sympathy
or staying in the Hall, I pray she is
careful about doing the former no
1 matter what the pressure. There are
J individual considerations that might
i sometimes change the case but for
; the majority faced with such a de
l cision Roble offers far the better
i life.
The large group in the Hall, in
; eluding as it does all the new wom
j en as well as the permanent mem
j bers of the Roble Club, assures any
j girl of congenial companions and at
I the same time of making more
! varied contacts than are possible in
! a small, self-selected group,
j Mr. Norman's use of the title
| "Roble Bastile" was and is ridicu
lous. He has evidently never lived
iin Roble. To the contrary, the in
; dependence of dormitory life, both
i as to the comforts of living—includ
| ing such concrete advantages as
j showers, laundry, privacy, and free-
I dom from sophomore duties and
