THE FALSE MADONNA—At the !
Stanford Theatre.
Here's a crook picture that goes |
over an inch ahead of most due to !
the excellent characterization by;
Kay Francis and the splendid acting ;
of the eighteen-year-old who plays j
the blind boy, whose name unfor- ;
tunaiely was omitted from the pro- I
grams.
Four tough crooks out for anyj
game, bar none, get wind of a huge
"job." They meet a molher on the
way to see the son whom she had
left when she left his father years
before. The husband has just died,
leaving the boy immensely wealthy.
When the mother dies with one of:
the crooks acting as physician the
quartet see their way open. Kay j
Francis will pose as the mother and .
get the dough .... but the boy is ,
blind and Miss Francis is human, j
The end is pretiy feeble but fori
the most part it's O.K. —E.T.P. j
THE RAINBOW TRAIL—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Just another Western. George
O'Brien, a fine, fearless fellow, goes
a-looking for a hidden valley
wherein a mythical maiden is said
to be imprisoned. Fierce villains
block his efforts, but George, prac
tically single-handed, slays lht*m all |
and wins his lady fair as a matter!
of course, since everyone else, ex
cept Roscoe Ates, is dead.
The five reels of the Notre Dame-
U.S.C. game show in fairly cleat
detail all of this exciting fray. It
seems good to see some real foot
ball in the movies that doesn't have 1
everlasting close-ups of the campus i
queen cheering our hero on to vic
tory, and yet has all the tenseness
and the bang-up ending that one j
finds in fiction. — B.IVT.
