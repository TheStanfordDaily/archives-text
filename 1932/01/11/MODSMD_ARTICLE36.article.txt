# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
j Wunct there was a struggling
young college youth who wunct
thought he could write a pretty fair
colyum in a college newspaper if
he was wunct given a chance. So
wunct the editor of this paper was
very worried on account of his wife
didn't show any interest in the ice
man or in anyone else but him so
he thought something must be amiss
(or amrs.) with his little matri
monial biplane. So just this wunct
he couldn't bother with the colyum
in his college newspaper and told
the struggling youth he could write
it just this wunct.
So the strg. yng. cge. youth
sat down at wunct and got
ready to write the colyum, but
all at wunct he discovered he
didn't know anything very funny
or even interesting to tell the
world about.
So he thought: If any more dizzy
co-eds around this place decide it's
fashionable to wear corduroy skirls
we men should have ruffled shirts
or blouses. They can't fool us about
the depression and hip pockets are
unnecessary evils unless there's
something to jingle inside the pock
ets. But that wouldn't do to write
a column about. It might become
too complicated.
Then he thought: There was a
formal dance up at Roble Friday
night, which was very nice and
supposed to tie the final lasting tie
around this frosh class and make
them eternal pals even if they
pledge different (oh, so different!)
houses. This dance also gave the
little Row gals a chance to bribe
the fellows going to the dance to
say only nice things about their
particular little feminine long.
(Tongue?—no, tong.) The Row girls
bribed many of these men with
promised invitations to Sunday ,
night suppers "some time very j
soon."
And he thought: The most
unusual thing about this dance
was the decorations which con
sisted of musical murals what
ever they are. The best one was

a lovely portrait of a big,
friendly stork which recently
considered Koble as its official
stopping-place for the coming
season. The girls thought it
would be appropriate and de
cidedly different to formally
dedicate this portrait instead of
bothering to write a class
prophecy. But then that really
isn't anything to write a colyum
about, either.

Then he thought: Now that Lagu- j
nita's filled up so early in the rea
son those ingenious sorority girls
should have some new rushing
plans. They might take the rushees
out and drown them and then at
tach a pledge pin so that when the
Angel of Death comes around they
can laugh and say "None of your I
gilded harp insignia, thanks. She's j
already wearing our badge ....'' |
And that would be final.
He also thought: I wonder what <
the K-pp-s will do the first time'
they try to use their canoe this
spring? Two years ago they loaned
it to the boys in that big while
house up on the hill near Hoover's
home, and the boys have kept it
ever since, and last week when they
decided to use it they discovered il
was all worn out and full of holes,
so returned it to the K-pp-s saying, j
"Sorry to have kept it so long!" But :
that isn't anything to write a colyum |
about.
And then he thought: This
basketball business is going to
be pretty interesting after all, i
and will give us a lot of laughs
and worries—but everybody else
knows all about that, too, so it's i
nothing to write a colyum about. i
So he thought: I really am a more
domestic guy than the editor, so
maybe I could find out just what's
amiss (or amrs.) with his home life,
and he can write the colyum. So he
went and found out—but that's
nothing ot write a colum about ....

he couldn't bother with the colyum
in his college newspaper and told
the struggling youth he could write
it just this wunct.
So the strg. yng. cge. youth
sat down at wunct and got
ready to write the colyum, but
all at wunct he discovered he
didn't know anything very funny
or even interesting to tell the
world about.
So he thought: If any more dizzy
co-eds around this place decide it's
fashionable to wear corduroy skirls
we men should have ruffled shirts
or blouses. They can't fool us about
the depression and hip pockets are
unnecessary evils unless there's
something to jingle inside the pock
ets. But that wouldn't do to write
a column about. It might become
too complicated.
Then he thought: There was a
formal dance up at Roble Friday
night, which was very nice and
supposed to tie the final lasting tie
around this frosh class and make
them eternal pals even if they
pledge different (oh, so different!)
houses. This dance also gave the
little Row gals a chance to bribe
the fellows going to the dance to
say only nice things about their
particular little feminine long.
(Tongue?—no, tong.) The Row girls
bribed many of these men with
promised invitations to Sunday ,
night suppers "some time very j
soon."
And he thought: The most
unusual thing about this dance
was the decorations which con
sisted of musical murals what
ever they are. The best one was

a lovely portrait of a big,
friendly stork which recently
considered Koble as its official
stopping-place for the coming
season. The girls thought it
would be appropriate and de
cidedly different to formally
dedicate this portrait instead of
bothering to write a class
prophecy. But then that really
isn't anything to write a colyum
about, either.

Then he thought: Now that Lagu- j
nita's filled up so early in the rea
son those ingenious sorority girls
should have some new rushing
plans. They might take the rushees
out and drown them and then at
tach a pledge pin so that when the
Angel of Death comes around they
can laugh and say "None of your I
gilded harp insignia, thanks. She's j
already wearing our badge ....'' |
And that would be final.

the K-pp-s will do the first time'
they try to use their canoe this
spring? Two years ago they loaned
it to the boys in that big while
house up on the hill near Hoover's
home, and the boys have kept it

decided to use it they discovered il
was all worn out and full of holes,
so returned it to the K-pp-s saying, j
"Sorry to have kept it so long!" But :

And then he thought: This
basketball business is going to
be pretty interesting after all, i

nothing to write a colyum about. i
So he thought: I really am a more
