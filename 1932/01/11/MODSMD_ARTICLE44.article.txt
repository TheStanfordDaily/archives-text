Stanford will meet the California '
Agricultural College at Davis in a
pro-Big Game breather on Novem
ber 12 next fall. Scheduling of this |
game fills in the one remaining gap j
in Ihe 1932 Cardinal football season.
Although the game will be the !
first football contest between Stan
lord and the California Aggies, the
Cardinals have met the Aggies an
nually in boxing. California Aggies
have entered the Coast Conference
before, playing Oregon State for the
last few years.
