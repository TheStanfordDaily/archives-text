# YEARLING HOOPSTERS DROP PAIR OF SLOW TILTS TO PALY AND PITT HIGHS
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
The Indian 1931 freshman has- 1
keteers made their local bow over j
the week-end, dropping a pair of
slow games to mediocre high-school j
teams. On Friday afternoon the!
Palo Alto High Vikings won
their third straight victory over a
Stanford yearling quintet, 15-7,
while on Saturday Pittsburg High
won a close game, 11-9.
Sevsral hundred fans saw a
smooth Palo Alto offense run up a !
10-1 lead at half time. Airtight de
fensive play of Palo Alto guards,
Misenhimer, Woods, and Johnson,
held the Indians to two field goals, '
by Sales and Mallatratt, in the sec
ond half.
The freshman players are sadly j
on Saturday afternoon, although the j
forwards were failing miserably on
close-in shots. The yearling five cut j
a 9-5 Pittsburg half-time lead to ,
9-9 at the end of the third quarter, |
but they couldn't score at all in the j

final period, while a long shot by
Enea in the closing minutes gave
Pittsburg their 11-9 margin.
The freshman playrs are sadly
lacking in shooting and passing
fundamentals. It is significant that
none of the forwards made a SIN
GLE basket in either game. As
might be expected, with one of the
best guards ever to don a Stanford
uniform as coach, the yearling
guards appear to be the mainstays
of the team. Gordon Mallatratt, for
mer Galileo guard, was the out
standing player in both games. He
is the best defensive player on the
squad, and handles the ball with a
finesse unusual among freshman
players.
The following men survived the
final squad cut on Friday: Braley,
C. Coiner, H. Coiner, Cox, Crowe,
Griswold, Kelly, Mack, Mallatratt,
Sales, Savage, Thompas, Huston, i
Butte, Bost, Meyer, and Kuhn.
