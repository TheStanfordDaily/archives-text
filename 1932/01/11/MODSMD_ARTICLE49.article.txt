## 
### 
Several changes have already oc- j
curred in the freshman tennis lad- :
der rankings announced last week. !
The first three, Lee, Lilienthal, and '
Dreyer, respectively, have played ,
no matches, but Nelson, number j
four, lost his position to Dana, 6-1, j
6-3, after Dana had defeated Moran
by an even more decisive score, 6-0, !
6-3. The original order has been j
changed from Nelson, Moran, Dana, j
to Dana, Nelson, Moran, these two |
matches having skyrocketed Dana'
right up into the money.
Grantier has been inserted as j
seventh, between Moran and Cooke, j
and Ransom was squeezed in below
| Cooke, ahead of Barnard, who is
! now tenth. Then, to prevent further
j complications, Cooke downed Ran
i som, 6-3, 5-7, 9-7, to hold his eighth
| place.
I Doubles combinations stack up as (
! follows: 1. Lee and Lilienthal; 2. |
Dreyer and Nelson; 3. Dana and'
