# POLO PROSPECTS, PRESENT AND FUTURE, BRIGHTEST IN HISTORY, STATES GORDAN

"Prospects for winning polo teams
at Stanford have never looked bet
ter than they do right now," Cap
tain Richard A. Gordan, polo men- i
tor, declared yesterday as he looked j
over the roster of aspiring poloists
for this quarter.
"Although we have a pretty good i
team already this season, next fall ;
should see the best outfit we've ever i
had. While Fleming, Lewis, and Holt j
will not be back, Gillham, Spalding.
Malone, and Luppen will make a j
combination that I think will be the j
best of any that I've coached in my j
four years at Stanford."
These four men are nearly the'
equal of the present first string, J
Gordan said. In another year, with 1
added experience the Redshirts
should have one of the most bril
liant aggregations on the coast. And
not only does the immediate future
look bright, but the outlook in years
to come is unusually good.
"The freshman tournout for the |
C squad," Gordan continued, is the
largest we've ever had here, and at
the same time shows the most prom
ise. With another year or so of prac
tice a lot of fine players can be
developed from this bunch."
I Practice this quarter has been de
i layed because of the soft condition |

of the ponies due to the bad weather
during Christmas vacation which
made exercise impossible. As soon
j as the mounts get in shape, garni
I will be scheduled with Peninsula
i teams.
