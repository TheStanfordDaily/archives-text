## 
### 
I With six of last year's lettermen
j back in school and with two mcm
! bers of the Class of 34's team good
enough to rank in the first varsity
eight, the prospects of a fine Stan
-1 ford fencing team are exceptionally
' bright, according to Coach Harry
Maloney. Of the squad that beat.
California 18 to 6 in 1931, only Cap
tain Jack Snyder and Higgins have
graduated.
The pi.-esent ranking in the foils
â€¢ finds Ferguson first, followed by
. Captain Leonard Pockman, Criley,
Pearmiin, Sheedy, Tom Pockman,
Reed, and Snider. Criley and Snider
were on last year's frosh team,
while Jill the others are leltermen.
Since a fencing team consists of
only five men, it can be seen that
competition for places will be ex
! ceediugly keen.
