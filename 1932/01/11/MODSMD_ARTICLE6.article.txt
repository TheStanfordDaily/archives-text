# LOWER DIVISION BACKED IN POLL
## Faculty Votes 123 Against Abolition, 90 In Favor 
### 
That the Stanford faculty opposes
abolition of the lower division in this
University is indicated by the result
of the poll taken on this question by
the Palo Alto Times.
The actual figures with one-third
of the faculty responding, were: 12."
against abolition and 90 in favor.
Opponents of the movement gave
as reasons for their stand on the
question: that the abolition ,of the
lower division would mean breaking
faith with the founders; that the
University is insufficiently equipped
financially to take such a step; that
junior colleges in their present state
are not prepared to undertake the
University's lower division work.
The chief arguments advanced by
proponents of the formation of a
graduate school to replace the four
year university were that university
education should begin where the
public school leaves off, and that
since junior colleges are now
equipped to take care of freshman
and sophomore college class instruc
tion, the privately endowed univer
sity should apply its resources to
higher education only.
Several instructors expressed
themselves as believing that the
abolition should be undertaken later
but that the financial condition of
the University now and the present,
state of the junior colleges does not
warrant such action at the present
time.
