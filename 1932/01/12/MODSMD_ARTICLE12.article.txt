I PARIS, Jan. 11. (A 3 )—Premier i

Pierre Laval told German Ambassa
dor Leopoid von Hoesch today that
a bad impression had been created
in France by Chancellor Bruening's
statement Saturday that Germany
no longer was able to pay repara
tions.
In explaining the Government's
attitude on the Bruening announce
ment, M. Laval used- what was de
scribed as "amicable but firm" lan
guage.
To Clarify Situation
At the Premier's office it was
s' id the Government would act on
Hie statement —if at all—only after
a cabinet session. The date for this
session probably will be set after
an important meeting tomorrow be
tween M. Laval and Aristide Briand,
Foreign Minister.
The Briand-Laval meeting and
the reopening of Parliament are ex
pected to clarify the political situa
tion caused by the death of Minis
ter of War Andre Maginot and the
illness of the Foreign Minister.
