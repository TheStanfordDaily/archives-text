England.
Her mother sent her to Americt
with instructions to learn all aboul
Americans, but not to marry one
Busy studying so far, Miss Skemp
hasn't disobeyed her parent. Bui
already her speech is becoming
Americanized, "jolly well" appear

less."
Comparing Oxford, which she ha.'
tltended, to Stanford, Miss Skemc
said I hat "Going to the city t<
rbmce is unheard of in English uni
versities. Students are allowed tr
attend only four dances a year, and
these are all sponsored and strict 1>
chaperoned by the school authori
ties. They last from 8 until 11:3C
o'clock r.nd the men and women g<

separately. The women sit in a row

The student from England says

-1 pletely different" from Stanford, and
I that she is amazed at "the huge
preponderance of men" here.
"One thing that amazes me is the
way in which, at the end of a lec
j ture, a bell rings, everyone slams

j "In England no one cares whether

I one thing at a time.
"I've never been in a London fog,
