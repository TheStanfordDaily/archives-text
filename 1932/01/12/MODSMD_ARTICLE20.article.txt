# REVISION MADE IN BOOKSTORE REBATE POLICY
## Slip Will Not Be Given For Less Than 50 Cents Effective Jan. 1 
### 
Changes in the rebate policy in
volving the size of individual pur
chases at the Stanford Bookstore
were announced yesterday by Pro
fessor E. P. Lesley, chairman of the
board of directors of the co-opera
tive enterprise.
Under the new plan, effective
since January 1, individual pur
chases of less than 50 cents will not
be given rebate slips. In support of
the new move, Professor Lesley
cited tiie figures for the business
done during the fidl quarter. Of
approximately 43,000 in sales, $3,000,
or about 7 per cent, was in sales
of less than 50 cents, at the same
time aggregating approximately half
of the individual transactions, Les
ley stated.
It was further pointed out that
clerical and bookkeeping work ne
cessitated by the large number of
transactions involved added costs
which would in turn cut, down the
percentage allowed in the rebates.
Four per cent was returned to the
students for the business done dur
ing the last quarter, he said, while
in previous quarters the rebate was
usually five or six.
Another point of interest that was
brought up showed a decrease of
about $5,000 in the amount of busi
ness done during the quarter just
past, at the same time that the cost
of doing business, including rent,
salaries, and the like remained un
changed.
Professor Lesley indicated his be
lief that a material saving could be
effected through the operation of the
new plan, which would reduce the
amount of work to be done by the
clerks and by the bookkeepers, thus
providing the needed cut in the cost
of doing business.
