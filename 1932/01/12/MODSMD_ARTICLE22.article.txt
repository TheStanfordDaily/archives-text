I BERLIN, Jan. 11. (/P) â€” Both
Aloph Hitler, National Socialist
leader, and Dr. Alfred Hugenberg,
leader of the Nationalists, refused
' tonight to give their support to the
j Government in extending for one
I year the term of office of President
Paul ven Hindenburg.
They informed Chancellor Hein
rich Bruening, who had hoped to
: avert Ihe turmoil of an election this
spring by having the Reichstag pro- ,
I long the President's tenure, that
I they could not be a party to the
j plan because they considered it a
I violation of the Constitution.
It was understood that both the
! Na/.i leader and Dr. Hugenberg
were writing letters to Dr. Bruen
i ing explaining they revered the j
' aged Von Hindenburg and wanted i
to see him re-elected, but they in- !
sistcd il be done constitutionally, |
that is, by popular vote.
