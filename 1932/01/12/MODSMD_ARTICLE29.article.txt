# STANFORD HAS "FIGHT"--BUNN; S.C. HERE NEXT
## Foul Shooting Also Helps Cagers Defeat Bruins, Declares Coach INJURIES HIT SQUAD Cordry, Schnetka Confined In P.A. Hospital 
### 
"Good old fight, that's what won
for Stanford," said John Bunn at
the conclusion of the second
U.C.L.A. hoop contest last Saturday
night. "And an almost perfect rec
ord of foul shooting was also re
sponsible," declared the coach.
According to the score books
U.C.L.A. made one more field goal
than did Stanford for the two nights'
play, which accounts for the fact
that the Bruins were apparently
outclassing the Cards offensively in
both contests.
With a duplication of this record
in the U.S.C. games here next Fri
day and Saturday the Cards may
down the Trojans, "the dark horse of
southern California," and become
the coast's "team to beat."
Bunn Scouts Troy
Coach Bunn is now returning
from Los Angeles where he scouted
the Trojans in their second game
with California last night, the Tro
jans having defeated the Bears Sat
urday.
Bunn expects a tough opponent
in the Trojans. It is reported that
they pi ay a tight defensive game.
Against California Saturday night
they stalled away twelve minutes
of the first half playing "keep
away."
With "Tiny Tom" Cordry, flashy
diminutive forward, and Bill
Schnetka, promising guard, confined
in the Palo Alto Hospital, Stanford's
squad has developed an injured list
which, although not large, is of
greater significance to a basketball
five than to a football eleven.
Injuries Not Serious
Cordry is suffering from a bruised
leg and Schnetka is laid up with a
cold. Both are not in a serious con
dition and are expected to report
to practice within a few days, which
will be without doubt in time for
the Trojan games this week-end.
Cordry was injured early in the
first half of Saturday night's Bruin
contest but continued the game in
brilliant fashion. This itself demon
strates how the Cards were fighting
against the Uclans.
Basketball practice was held last
night as usual despite the absence
of Coach Bunn. Jimmy "Rabbit"
Bradshaw drilled the squad in a
short scrimmage session.

short scrimmage session.
"Good old fight, that's what won
for Stanford," said John Bunn at
the conclusion of the second
U.C.L.A. hoop contest last Saturday
night. "And an almost perfect rec
ord of foul shooting was also re
sponsible," declared the coach.
According to the score books
U.C.L.A. made one more field goal
than did Stanford for the two nights'
play, which accounts for the fact
that the Bruins were apparently
outclassing the Cards offensively in
both contests.
With a duplication of this record
in the U.S.C. games here next Fri
day and Saturday the Cards may
down the Trojans, "the dark horse of
southern California," and become
the coast's "team to beat."
Bunn Scouts Troy
Coach Bunn is now returning
from Los Angeles where he scouted
the Trojans in their second game
with California last night, the Tro
jans having defeated the Bears Sat
urday.
Bunn expects a tough opponent
in the Trojans. It is reported that
they pi ay a tight defensive game.
Against California Saturday night
they stalled away twelve minutes
of the first half playing "keep
away."
With "Tiny Tom" Cordry, flashy
diminutive forward, and Bill
Schnetka, promising guard, confined
in the Palo Alto Hospital, Stanford's
squad has developed an injured list
which, although not large, is of
greater significance to a basketball
five than to a football eleven.
Injuries Not Serious
Cordry is suffering from a bruised
leg and Schnetka is laid up with a
cold. Both are not in a serious con
dition and are expected to report
to practice within a few days, which
will be without doubt in time for
the Trojan games this week-end.
Cordry was injured early in the
first half of Saturday night's Bruin
contest but continued the game in
brilliant fashion. This itself demon
strates how the Cards were fighting
against the Uclans.
Basketball practice was held last
night as usual despite the absence
of Coach Bunn. Jimmy "Rabbit"
Bradshaw drilled the squad in a
short scrimmage session.
