TORONTO, Ont., Jan. 11. (/Pi A
I University of Toronto student is
j "broke" with $20 in gold in his
| pocket.
The student spent the summer
j panning gold in the Yukon. He sold
i part of his earnings in the north
| country, and brought more than an
j ounce bock.
Now he can't dispose of his ounce
I of gold. The banks won't, accept it,
the jewelry stores said the amount
was "too small to bother with," and
the refineries agreed.
"It's a funny suituation when you
J can't sell gold," he said, "but maybe
j it's the gold standard."
