Because he feared that the Fourth of July exodus would
hurt the attendance, Monohan arranged for the meet to he

Temploton, (loach Dean (Iromwell of Southern (lalifornia
and Trainer Harry Hiliman of Dartmouth are among those
who believe that the scheduling of the I(UA within six days
of the final Olympic (lames trials, to be held here July to
ld, is not for the best interests of the participants, especi
ally the track men who must run four or six heats and lmals
in less than a week. Temploton and (Iromwell are easily
the nation's outstanding track coaches and their opinion
should count for something. But Willis Hunter, director
of athletics at Southern (lalifornia, accepted the date pro
posed by (lalifornia over Cromwell's protest, and with those
two schools agreed, there was nothing else for Stanford to
do but come into the fold.
Monohan argues that all the Eastern members of the
KM A have agreed to the dale, but it might be well to con
sider that (lalifornia, as hosts, proposed it, and the coaches
might easily have taken that into consideration, consider

(lalifornia, of course, has little or nothing to lose by the
proximity of the two events, because, at the most, they have
only two Olympic Games prospects, neither of them out
standing. But Stanford and Southern (lalifornia have a
host of candidates for the American team, and they will
be the ones to suffer most. When one considers that many
Games prospects, like Simpson, Tolan and Churchill, are
going to compete in semi-final trials two weeks before the
iinal tryouts here, il is easier to understand the collegians'
disadvantage. The non-collegiate competitors will have
thirteen days rest; the ICIA men will have six. We hope
Monohan gets his -fMfi.OOO.

Because he feared that the Fourth of July exodus would
hurt the attendance, Monohan arranged for the meet to he
held nl Berkeley on July <S !), instead of July 1 and 2.
Temploton, (loach Dean (Iromwell of Southern (lalifornia
and Trainer Harry Hiliman of Dartmouth are among those
who believe that the scheduling of the I(UA within six days
of the final Olympic (lames trials, to be held here July to
ld, is not for the best interests of the participants, especi
ally the track men who must run four or six heats and lmals
in less than a week. Temploton and (Iromwell are easily
the nation's outstanding track coaches and their opinion
should count for something. But Willis Hunter, director
of athletics at Southern (lalifornia, accepted the date pro
posed by (lalifornia over Cromwell's protest, and with those
two schools agreed, there was nothing else for Stanford to
do but come into the fold.
Monohan argues that all the Eastern members of the
KM A have agreed to the dale, but it might be well to con
sider that (lalifornia, as hosts, proposed it, and the coaches
might easily have taken that into consideration, consider
ing il poor form to object.
(lalifornia, of course, has little or nothing to lose by the
proximity of the two events, because, at the most, they have
only two Olympic Games prospects, neither of them out
standing. But Stanford and Southern (lalifornia have a
host of candidates for the American team, and they will
be the ones to suffer most. When one considers that many
Games prospects, like Simpson, Tolan and Churchill, are
going to compete in semi-final trials two weeks before the
iinal tryouts here, il is easier to understand the collegians'
disadvantage. The non-collegiate competitors will have
thirteen days rest; the ICIA men will have six. We hope
Monohan gets his -fMfi.OOO.
