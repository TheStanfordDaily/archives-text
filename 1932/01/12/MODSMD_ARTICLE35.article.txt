Like so many other businesses, that of the Bookstore
litis undoubtedly felt the pinch of depression. It is in an
< fl'orl to give the same service at less cost that the new plan
was adopted. It was pointed out that half the individual
transactions involved sales of less than 50 cents during the
fall quarter, so it is easy to see that cutting the clerical and
bookkeeping costs in tabulating and classifying the rebate
slips would be reflected in greater rebate percentages.
The new ruling may also have the effect of causing
students to hold their purchases until the total will amount
to more than 50 cents and in so doing they can be cared
for bv a smaller number of clerks. Reductions in personnel
could also effect a further saving as would show in the
salary figures on the work sheet.
All members of IheS i wi oun Daily staff are cordially
invited to attend a meeting this afternoon at 1 o'clock. The
usual instructive lectures will be the main feature of the
