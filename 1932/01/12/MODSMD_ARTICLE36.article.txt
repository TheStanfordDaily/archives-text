# BULL SESSION
## FOR WOMEN ONLY 
### 
With everything in the Daily ex
cept the A.P. dispatches from Wash
ington dealing with women's rush
ing, the Bull Session has felt like a
journalistic outcast,. Which is more
important: who will move into the
White House or who will move into
the Gimmey Five Betas manshion?
Obviously, the latter. It is evident
that the branding by each sorority
of its "catch" as ''THE class" is of
more interest than Sino-Japanese
relations. Consequently, it is high
time that we get into the swim; be
fore all the*water has evaporated.
Yesterday, an article in the Cam
pus Opinion column stated that Mr.
Norman, creator of the terrible title,
"Roble Bastille," had never lived in
Roble. We hope he hasn't. And al
though we presume to also talk of
Roble and Sorority houses, wo state
in self defense, that we too have
never lived in either place.
There are certain things that
every woman who thinks she is
about to make the greatest decision
in her life should realize before she
takes the jump from which, like
death, taxes, and dry lectures, there
is no escape.
To wear an ornate bit of jewelry
inscribed with all sorts of mystic
signs over your heart is not the
greatest thnig in the world. It.is not
a key that opens to you all the
great doors on this campus. You
may get a few more first dates with
your pin, but you can't hide behind
a pin all your life. Whether you
live in Roble, Row, or commute
from Milpitas, the men soon know;
they're that way.
Nov/, while Roble may not be a

|
Bastille, it surely is a curio shop. |
It is Rc ble, more than the row, that '
has perpetuated the common notion i
of Stanford women. It is Roble that j
changed "four out of five have it" j
from dental slogan to an estimation |
of Stanford women's sex appeal, j
That does not mean, however, that j
every Robleite is a "dud" as far as j
dating goes. There are women at |
the "home of the 500" that make a i
lot of pin-toters look like person- |
ality paupers and beauty bankrupts, j
Where a girl makes her bed and j
hangs her clothes does not alter the j
Almighty's gilts.
Your belonging to a sorority v/ill i
not make going easier in any field j
of campus activity. If you lack "it," j
the sisters may angle some dates |
for you but it is just as uncom- I
fortable to be the perennial "other j
girl" on a double date as to stay at j
home, occasionally. That's important, i
Also remember there are all kinds j
of Stanford sororities. Some are j
O.K. and others make Roble—any |
wing of it—seem like a garden of j
paradise. In conclusion, remember, I
innocent frosh, two things. First, all !
that glitters is not even gold plate;
and chairs, fancy saucers, etc., do
not always belong to the sorority;
further rushing manners are not
everyday manners. Second, you
must live with individuals and not
a name. Choose friends; not a repu- j
tation or a group. You can have |
good friends in Roble and catty as- j
sociates on the Row; you can have I
genuine friends in a sorority; and!
drab playmates in Roble.
Choose with your head; not with
the herd! —Abe Mellinkoff
