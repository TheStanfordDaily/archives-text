SQUARE CROOKS—At the Alcazar i
Theatre, San Francisco.
"It's just a good dress rehearsal.
In a few days we'll be giving a
smooth show," said Joe E. Brown j
of his opening performance in
"Square Crooks."
If this is true we should very i
much like to see this ripping com- |
edy again. It is not only funny and ;
free from the usual slap-stick but j
it is, strangely enough, quite spot- !
less, the shadiest line being Brown's !
—"Eveiything's against us, even 1
our underwear."
Brown and his wife, played by '
Isabel Withers, carry the show with !
their witty lines as newlyweds.
Brown, who plays on the stage as ;
a means of relaxation from his work j
with pictures, will continue in this !
vehicle until February 15 when he j
commences his next talkie.

MIRRORS OF 1932—Brewer, War
ren and Putnam. IO.'M. |
mous.)
"Mirrors of 1932," anonymous au
thorship, paint not unfamiliar pic- ,
tures of Hoover, Coolidge, the lute
Dwight Morrow, A1 Smith, Young,
Roosevelt, Pinchot, Ritchie, Robin- i
son, and Newton D. Baker. And .
there is a chapter of "another vote
getting tycoon who will loom largest
of all at the conventions" .... John
Barleycorn.
The anonymous author cannot
hide a Democratic partiality. It
comes forth shamelessly in the por- (
traits of nearly all the candidates, '
particularly in the case of Newton
D. Baker.
The author considers Herbert
Hoover as a failure. He attributes
this failure to professed lack of hu
manity:
It explains a great deal about
Herbert Hoover to learn that he was !
not a "swimming hole kid." Hoover
does not like people. He can work j
with underlings but not with 1
equals. The author admits Hoover's 1
warm friends: "I find few, however, i
who can define their feeling for \
him."
There is a delicate quip at "that '
pragmatic institution, Leland Stan
ford University." We read on, Mr.
Anonymous, with amused conde- ;
scension. —A.J.G. j
TURNABOUT—By Thorne Smith. j
Doublday Doran. New York. 1931. j
$2. (At the Magazine Shop.)
Thorne Smith, has before this, j
used the elegantly immoral very |
amusingly; but for bland bawdery
on a lavish scale "Turnabout" seems
to surpass even his "Night Life of
the Gods"—a book which, incident
ally, despite a final maudlinity, is
screamingly funnier.
The publishers assert that within
the covers are implications of a so
cial nature powerful enough to
stagger, or something of Ihe sort.
Those saliric implications, however,
peer out only occasionally, immod
estly clad, and use English other I
than the King's very fluently. Moral, j
it may be evident, never becomes mi j
obtrusive herein as to constitute a ;
piece of moral nutshell in consider- '•
ably brandied pudding.
The* book starts mildly enough, i
but works itself into a frenzy soon ;
after a certain little Mr. Ram has
reversed the sexes of his prolagon- J
ists —with results ludicrous and un- j
conventional.
Harmless, entertainment.

PRECIOUS PORCELAIN—By N« i I
Bell. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New
York, 1931. S2.. r »0. (At the Palo;
Alto Book Shop).
One can only wonder at the dec a- j
dent state of modern criticism when '

I the sedate Manchester Guardian al
i lows itself to whoop ecstatically, "If
L 931 produces another novel of the
calibre of Mr. Bell's it will be a red
■ letter day for English fiction." Par
ticularly frightful is such a blurb
when inspired by such baldly ter
rible as the volume under considera-
I tion.
Mr. Bell has carefully introduced
a character, one R. Blaney, from a
prenatal state, through some theatri
| cal paternal cursings, to birth and
thence forward, to manhood in sev
eral highly moral family scenes.
Having thus meticulously intro-
I duced Blaney, Bell very ungallantly
i forgets him until the boob's allegedly
: happy ending, redundant and totally
j unconvinving.
Meanwhile the Bell jangles off
into a history of maliciousness which
, begins with the uprooting of a pomp
-1 ous granite monument and pro
| gresses thereafter to a series of
i shockingly inartistic and neuseat
j ingly messy murders.
j The book is nonsense, unpleasjfrit
! and unworthy. Horror of an in
finitely better sort was Walpole's
Portrait of a Man With Red Hair.
Stevenson in Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
"Hyde used hokum treatment of the
; hlual—personality far more success
, lully. And Arthur Machen's care
ful shocker ... oh well.
J.S.S.
P.S.—A series of seductions in the
book which are a strain upon cre
dulily and biology are innocently
1 and howlingly funny. But I coun
j'sel instead . . . even Nick Carter?
