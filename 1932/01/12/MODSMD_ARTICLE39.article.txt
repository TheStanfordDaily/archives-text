SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11. (A*)â€”
Demands of California's "hunger
marchers" for relief were refused
by Governor James Rolph, Jr., here
today.
Loudspeakers carried Rolph's de
nial to (he marchers who gathered
I in front of the State Building from
! widespread sections of California
I and to crowds of others who over
j flowed from Civic Center Square
i onto sidewalks and streets.
"Work and not laws will find the
stomachs of the hungry," he said.
I The Governor explained he would
I not call a special session of the
I legislature because of the "extreme
; improbability that legislation could
j not afford immediate relief.
"While Congress and the State
i Legislatures might be debating over
j some of the laws and suggestions,
; I am and have been taking steps to
I get men at work."
