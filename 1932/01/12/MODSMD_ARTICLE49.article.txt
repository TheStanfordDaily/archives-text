# Frosh Track Prospects Brightened By New Additions
## BILL ELLINGTON IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FRESHMAN SEASON Four New Men Bring Total Of Turnout Up To Forty-Seven 
### Dick Strouse 
As forty-seven freshman track
men sweat and strain daily in the
old oval, Coach Bill Ellington can
he heard muttering to himself:
"Nine years straight. Poor Cal. El
lington'.'- exclamations concern the
possibilities of the ninth straight
Stanford victory in the Little Big
Meet, arid the present turnout seems
to make this victory a distinct pos
sibility.
The last four of the' forty-seven
to sign up are especially responsible
for Ellington's optimism, as they add
balance to the squad. These new
men are headed by Dan Lamont of
Lawrenceville, New Jersey, who en
tered Stanford this quarter and
brought with him a prep school j
record of 5 feet 11 V-i inches in the j
high-jump. Lamont and Schween, i
who is capable of (5 feet IV2 inches, j
should be the best pair of freshman 1
high-jumpers in the country.
Josiin Weight Star
The willing but inexperienced i
freshman weight men received an '
important addition to their ranks;
when the champion high-school j
discus-thrower of San Francisco j
turned out yesterday afternoon. The :
lusty lad's name is Herb Josiin, and j
lie has thrown the 12-pound shot S
47 feet as well as hurled the discus j
120 feet.
Captain Johnny Mottram of the i
Class oi '35's football team is said j
to he as speedy in the quarter-mile j
as he is on the gridiron. Since the j
440- is the weakest of the track j
events, Mottram's presence is espe- I
eially welcome. Johnny is also 1
working on the pole-vault, and has !
a high-school mark of 10 feet (5 j
inches. . •
Rothert Vaults I
The return to school of Larry!
Rothert insures the babes of one
capable vaulter, so that Mottram
can concentrate on the 440 if neces
sary.
Ellington claims he has a find in
the half-mile in the person of a run
ner named Underbill. Although in
experienced and desiring to run the
mile, Underbill probably will both
gain experience and run the 880 j
under the Templeton system.

he heard muttering to himself:
"Nine years straight. Poor Cal. El
lington'.'- exclamations concern the
possibilities of the ninth straight
Stanford victory in the Little Big
Meet, arid the present turnout seems
to make this victory a distinct pos
sibility.
The last four of the' forty-seven
to sign up are especially responsible
for Ellington's optimism, as they add
balance to the squad. These new
men are headed by Dan Lamont of
Lawrenceville, New Jersey, who en
tered Stanford this quarter and
brought with him a prep school j
record of 5 feet 11 V-i inches in the j
high-jump. Lamont and Schween, i
who is capable of (5 feet IV2 inches, j
should be the best pair of freshman 1
high-jumpers in the country.
Josiin Weight Star
The willing but inexperienced i
freshman weight men received an '
important addition to their ranks;
when the champion high-school j
discus-thrower of San Francisco j
turned out yesterday afternoon. The :
lusty lad's name is Herb Josiin, and j
lie has thrown the 12-pound shot S
47 feet as well as hurled the discus j
120 feet.
Captain Johnny Mottram of the i
Class oi '35's football team is said j
to he as speedy in the quarter-mile j
as he is on the gridiron. Since the j
440- is the weakest of the track j
events, Mottram's presence is espe- I
eially welcome. Johnny is also 1
working on the pole-vault, and has !
a high-school mark of 10 feet (5 j
inches. . •
Rothert Vaults I
The return to school of Larry!
Rothert insures the babes of one
capable vaulter, so that Mottram
can concentrate on the 440 if neces
sary.
Ellington claims he has a find in
the half-mile in the person of a run
ner named Underbill. Although in
experienced and desiring to run the
mile, Underbill probably will both
gain experience and run the 880 j
under the Templeton system.
As forty-seven freshman track
men sweat and strain daily in the
old oval, Coach Bill Ellington can
