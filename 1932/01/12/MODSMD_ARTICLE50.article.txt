afternoon, against the St. Mary's
freshmen, Coach Vance Fawcett's
yearling hoopsters settled down to
serious work yesterday afternoon,
after two defeats by''Palo Alto and
Pittsburg high school teams in their
first games of the year.
The Indians will face a much
stronger team in the Moi'agans than
they met in (he Pittsburg and Palo
Alto fives. Last year the baby Gaels
were one of the strongest yearling
quintet.: on the coast, although they
did not play the Stanford freshmen.
The first two games left the bat
tle for forward positions still much
in doubt. A1 Page and Ted Crowe,
because of superior floor work, have
a slight edge, but Frank Cox,
Charles Coiner, and several others
will give them a battle.
Practice in shooting is the medi
cine needed by the Indian babes,
and they will undoubtedly get large
doses during the next few weeks.
The floor work and team piay of
the yearlings is showing steady im
provement.
