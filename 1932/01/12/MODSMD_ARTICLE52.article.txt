IT WASN'T because of a lack of
trick formations that U.C.L.A. drop
ped last week-end's double-header.
That "ring around the rosy" play
worked repeatedly to draw the
Stanford defense out of position,
and could also serve to kill time.
Even more interesting was what
amounted to a veritable footbail
split bucq. One man, usually Lin
thicum, would stand about on the
foul line with the ball, and holding
it waist high, would first fake it to
a player charging in from one side,
and then HAND (not pass) it to
another, who would shoot.
This was the first play the Bruins
used Friday night, and although it
didn't bring a basket on that occa
sion, it did on several others during
tha series.
<-'♦ • v <♦>
ONE OF T!IE outstanding
features of the Bruin quintet
was a defense that at times was
air-tight. One of the reasons
why, was Soest, blond guard
who wasn't even regarded as a
likely starter. Nor was defense
his only forte. In Friday's game
he garnered two field goals
when they were hatlly needed
by the Bruins late in the second
half, one of which he sank from
the center of the floor. His bas
ket Saturday night opened scor
ing festivities for the visitors.
Linthicum lived up to his
reputation in every way. He was
the key man of the Bruin of
fense, and although closely
watched, accounted for nine
points both nights. Piper, the
Westwood forward who ran wild
Saturday night to score 12

points, "high" for the series,
is only a sophomore. Like
"Frenchy" LaCombe, he is a
jaysee transfer, having gone to
TJ.C.L.A. from Los Angeles Jun
ior College.
DAVE PACKARD, Stanford's big
sophomore center, shows he is gain
ing experience and confidence with
every start. Coach Bunn relieved
him with Doub when he became
unsteady in the first game, but
Dave returned to the floor in the
closing minutes to shoot the foul
shot that cinched the game. With
the score tied at 22-22, LaCombe
took a pass from Baker for a field
goal. Time was scarce, but the
Bruins still had a chance to at least
lie the score when Packard settled
the matter with a free throw.
In both games he got the tip-off
the greater part of the time, and
worked well at the center position
on attack. When he again finds the
shooting eye had in the Oregon
State game, he will be one tough
hombre.
STANFORD'S GUARD situa
tion is about as sweet as any
coach could ask. Between Baker,
Norgard, Rintala, Schnetka, and
Tod, Bunn need have few wor
ries in that direction. At cen
ter, besides Packard, he has
Doub, who has looked good at
evedy appearance, and big Han
cock.
The forward matter is not
quite so rosy. Of course La-
Combe and Cordry arc SEV
ERAL forwards. LaCombe has
looked both good and bad, but

he always comes up with a big
scoring total in spite of being (
closely watched.
But dynamic "Tiny Tom'' is in
the hospital with a concussion
that may or may not keep him
out of the U.S.C. games this
week-end, and reserves are
scarce. Meade and Palmer are
the most likely candidates.

IT WASN'T because of a lack of
trick formations that U.C.L.A. drop
ped last week-end's double-header.
That "ring around the rosy" play
worked repeatedly to draw the
Stanford defense out of position,
and could also serve to kill time.
Even more interesting was what
amounted to a veritable footbail
split bucq. One man, usually Lin
thicum, would stand about on the
foul line with the ball, and holding
it waist high, would first fake it to
a player charging in from one side,
and then HAND (not pass) it to
another, who would shoot.
This was the first play the Bruins
used Friday night, and although it
didn't bring a basket on that occa
sion, it did on several others during
tha series.

ONE OF T!IE outstanding
features of the Bruin quintet
was a defense that at times was
air-tight. One of the reasons
why, was Soest, blond guard
who wasn't even regarded as a
likely starter. Nor was defense
his only forte. In Friday's game
he garnered two field goals
when they were hatlly needed
by the Bruins late in the second
half, one of which he sank from
the center of the floor. His bas
ket Saturday night opened scor
ing festivities for the visitors.
Linthicum lived up to his
reputation in every way. He was
the key man of the Bruin of
fense, and although closely
watched, accounted for nine
points both nights. Piper, the
Westwood forward who ran wild
Saturday night to score 12

points, "high" for the series,
is only a sophomore. Like
"Frenchy" LaCombe, he is a
jaysee transfer, having gone to
TJ.C.L.A. from Los Angeles Jun
ior College.
DAVE PACKARD, Stanford's big
sophomore center, shows he is gain
ing experience and confidence with
every start. Coach Bunn relieved
him with Doub when he became
unsteady in the first game, but
Dave returned to the floor in the
closing minutes to shoot the foul
shot that cinched the game. With
the score tied at 22-22, LaCombe
took a pass from Baker for a field
goal. Time was scarce, but the
Bruins still had a chance to at least
lie the score when Packard settled
the matter with a free throw.
In both games he got the tip-off
the greater part of the time, and
worked well at the center position
on attack. When he again finds the
shooting eye had in the Oregon
State game, he will be one tough
hombre.
STANFORD'S GUARD situa
tion is about as sweet as any
coach could ask. Between Baker,
Norgard, Rintala, Schnetka, and
Tod, Bunn need have few wor
ries in that direction. At cen
ter, besides Packard, he has
Doub, who has looked good at
evedy appearance, and big Han
cock.
The forward matter is not
quite so rosy. Of course La-
Combe and Cordry arc SEV
ERAL forwards. LaCombe has
looked both good and bad, but

he always comes up with a big
scoring total in spite of being (
closely watched.
But dynamic "Tiny Tom'' is in
the hospital with a concussion
that may or may not keep him
out of the U.S.C. games this
week-end, and reserves are
scarce. Meade and Palmer are
the most likely candidates.
