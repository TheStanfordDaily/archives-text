The Sequoia-Phi Gamma Delta

held tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Pavilion, Gene Mires, intramural
manager, stated yesterday. The rest
of the schedule, although tentative,
will remain as printed in these col
umns yesterday unless further no- !
tice is given.
Referees were picked for each j
event and given final instructions
in the rules last night. Rules govern
ing the games are to be found in
the intramural handbook, which is
available in the gym. Games will be
of fifteen minute halves with a five
minute rest period between.
With pre-game dope strangely
lacking this season, rumor has it j
that the defending champs of the j
Sigma Chi outfit will be given a |
run for their money by the Chi i
Psi's in League I. The title-holders I
meet the Japanese Club tonight in j
the first game at Encina Gym.
Teh six leagues, of six entrants |
each, will be in full swing by the j
end of next week when Round I !
will be completed. Mires declared j
that the rules governing contests j
will be rigidly enforced this year j
and thai ignorance will not serve |
as an excuse in any case.
