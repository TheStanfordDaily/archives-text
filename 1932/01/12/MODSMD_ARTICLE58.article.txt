### 
li> a deep, soft, mellow voice like
the river of life which he was de
scribing, Howard Thurman, made
his last public address to Stanford
students yesterday afternoon at 1
o'clock in lobby of the Stanford
Chlist ian Association.
The Negro preacher, educator,
poet, philosopher, made his subject
the "peep River." In interpreting
life as a river, simple in origin,
growing in size and power, always
flowing, always different, with a
definite goal, the speaker made his
pictures clear and meaningful. His
talk was made rich and striking
with figures of speech, vigorous
metaphors, and similes.
"There may come a flood time of
the rivet," said the speaker, "when
life becomes terrible instead of calm,
and its unrelenting power advances
on each alike, whether he be good
or bad.
"This river has a goal, and the
answer to flood time is a larger
opening to the sea, for nothing can
stop it from reaching this ultimate
goal. And the sea is also the source
from which the river gains its
water. Life is like that. The goal of
life is God, that out of which life
comes, and to which it returns." In
this manner Thurman ended his
talk.
Last evening the visitor held his
last meeting here when he talked
with a group who are studying the
Records in the Life of Jesus, as
compiled by Dr. Sharman. While on
the campus he preached in the Me
morial Church Sunday morning,
conducted an open forum later, ac
companied a group of men and
women students to a cabin retreat
Sunday afternoon, and sat with the
International Table yesterday noon.
