Taking the ball from the tip-off
and k.-oping it mainly because of
their advantage in height over their
smaller but faster opponents, a not
too-smoth Sigma Chi quintet
trounced the Japanese Club 32-9 in
,-t game featured by bad passing,
fouls, and in many instances by ter
rible shooting. Bud Davenport,
high-point man, seemed to be in
most of the action with Paul Palmer
and Henry Haight, guards on the
How outfit.
Unless the Row men spend a lot
of time smoothing over the rough
: pots and learn to take advantage
of the set-ups such as they had last
night and which they certainly will
not have in such quantities in the
future, it looks like a vacant space
for the trophy shelf in the Sigma
Chi house this winter.
Champs Cold
The defending champs, although
showing possibilities, were not able
to click except in a few instances.
Iliyomi Nawamura of the Club, di
minutive center, put up a great
fight but was unable to grab (he
ball at the tip-off because of his
height. Buster Holmes refereed the
contest.
A flashy center in ihe person of
Jack Ilocrner, all-state high-school
man from Nebraska, furnished most
of the evening's entertainment at
the Pavilion in scoring 14 out of the
Fiji's 19 points on Sequoia. Burrel
Leonard on the Sequoia squad was
high-point man with five digits to
his credit. Although the contest was
fairly fast, both teams seemed to
need plenty of practice.
Speedy Tilt
In a speedy affair with lots of ac
tion but plenty of roughness thrown
in, the Phi Delts took the Chi Psi's
22 to 9. Marcus Godfrey of the win
ning casaba-tossers took honors
with 13 points to his credit. This
was League ll's first contest and
the Phi Delts compared fairly well
with the Fiji and Sigma Chi outfits.
The El Campo-Phi Kappa Psi
clash, scheduled for last night, was
postponed to January 20 because of
a death this week. This will be the
last contest in Round I, which
closes that evening. No games are
to be held tonight and squads from
Leagues II and 111 will meet to
morrow, schedules to be released

Jack Ilocrner, all-state high-school
man from Nebraska, furnished most
of the evening's entertainment at
the Pavilion in scoring 14 out of the
Fiji's 19 points on Sequoia. Burrel
Leonard on the Sequoia squad was
high-point man with five digits to
his credit. Although the contest was
fairly fast, both teams seemed to
need plenty of practice.
Speedy Tilt
In a speedy affair with lots of ac
tion but plenty of roughness thrown
in, the Phi Delts took the Chi Psi's
22 to 9. Marcus Godfrey of the win
ning casaba-tossers took honors
with 13 points to his credit. This
was League ll's first contest and
the Phi Delts compared fairly well
with the Fiji and Sigma Chi outfits.
The El Campo-Phi Kappa Psi
clash, scheduled for last night, was
postponed to January 20 because of
a death this week. This will be the
last contest in Round I, which
closes that evening. No games are
to be held tonight and squads from
Leagues II and 111 will meet to
morrow, schedules to be released
in the morning.
YESTERDAY'S SCORES
Sigma Chi .'!2, Japanese Club 9
Phi Delta The la 22. Chi Fsi 9
Phi Gamma Delta 19, Seqouia 11
Taking the ball from the tip-off
and k.-oping it mainly because of
their advantage in height over their
smaller but faster opponents, a not
too-smoth Sigma Chi quintet
trounced the Japanese Club 32-9 in
,-t game featured by bad passing,
fouls, and in many instances by ter
rible shooting. Bud Davenport,
high-point man, seemed to be in
most of the action with Paul Palmer
and Henry Haight, guards on the
How outfit.
Unless the Row men spend a lot
of time smoothing over the rough
: pots and learn to take advantage
of the set-ups such as they had last
night and which they certainly will
not have in such quantities in the
future, it looks like a vacant space
for the trophy shelf in the Sigma
Chi house this winter.
Champs Cold
The defending champs, although
showing possibilities, were not able
to click except in a few instances.
Iliyomi Nawamura of the Club, di
minutive center, put up a great
fight but was unable to grab (he
ball at the tip-off because of his
height. Buster Holmes refereed the
contest.
