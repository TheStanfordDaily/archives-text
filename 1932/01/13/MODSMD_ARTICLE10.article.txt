### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12. (/P) â€”
Chairman Metcalf of the Senate
Committee taking testimony on the
Bingham Four Per Cent Beer bill i
today termed newspaper accounts I
of the hearings unbiased and invited
presentation of any evidence that
newspapers were withholding space
to the "Dry" side of Prohibition.
The Rhode Island Republican, an j
anti-Prohibitionist, took this action |
in reply to a charge by Senator I
Brookhart, Republican, lowa, a |
Prohibitionist, that the press was j
giving "outlandish and unreason- |
able" publicity in opposition to the |
dry laws.
Brookhart also said he had been
informed that newspapers had or
ganized a "sort of racket" against i
Dry organizations because the latter}
had "refused or neglected to buy j
space" in the papers.
Mete;.lf said in his opinion the J
press associations and correspond
ents representing individual news- I
papers had reported the beer hear- ;
ings as "fairly as possible, but if it ;
is true that there is some sort of !
news racketeering going on 1 want I
those organizations who have such |
evidence to present it to this com- j
mittee."
