j Small flurries of snow on the
i campus late yesterday evening
| brought winter to the Stanford
campus, and made the snow blanket
on the hills back of the campus
seem much nearer. Enough snow
I fell along the Skyline Boulevard,
j directly back of the campus, to at
| tract crowds of people in hope of
j winter sports.
I The storm is a result of a low
I pressure area in Wyoming, and the
San Francisco weather bureau pre
dicts continued cold and rain.
Mount Diablo in the East Bay re
gion and Mount Tamalpais in Marin
county were both blanketed by
snow, while rain fell over the whole
bay region, totaling .09 of an inch.
Late in the afternoon the snowfall
on the Skyline assumed blizzard
proportions, making driving diffi
cult. The moisture from the melting
snow, added to recent heavy pre
cipitation, has caused several large
sections of the mountain route to
slip down the hill.
