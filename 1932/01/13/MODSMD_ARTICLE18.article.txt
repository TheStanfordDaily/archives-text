# 'Bird In Hand' Comedy Of Old And New Standards
## 
### Harrison Foss 
An old English country tavern —
the "Bird In Hand" Inn —a mixture
of the old and now—still surviving
on the story that once, Queen
Elizabeth herself stopped there.
This is the setting of John Drink
water's comedy, in rehearsal now
under the direction of Harold Hel
venston, for its campus debut in two
weeks.
Famous; for his biographical plays,
"Mary Queen of Scots, "Robert E.
Lee," "Oliver Cromwell," and
"Abraham Lincoln," the present
production, "Bird In Hand," is
Drinkwater's only comedy. His suc
cess is concretely attested to by the
notable long run that this human
story ieceived both on Broadway
and in London.
Drinkwater's theme is the clash
of old and young—of fresh stand
ards and outgrown prejudices. Tho
story is built around an odd group
of people who gather one stormy
night ul the "Bird In Hand" Inn.

I Although there are only eight
| characters, a whole scale of human
i conditions are covered, from Mr.
| Blanquct, sardine salesman, to aris
j tocratic Sir Robert Arnwood. Curi
i ously enough for a play, every
j character is vital; each plays his
own lead in solving the problem
I that the play presents.
The scene opens upon Joan
| Greenleaf engaged in a furious ar
| gumcnt with her father over the
j fact that tho son of tho village
! squire, above her station in life,
I continues to dance attendance. Now
I enter throe wayfarers, a famous
' barrister, a rich man's son, and a
j cockney sardine salesman. The
Grecnltafs are in such agitation that
j they confide their troubles to their
; guests, and all take a hand in the
I situation.
Drinkwater, top man among mod
| orn historical playwrights, has made
! his single comedy an absorbing
! drama.
