# Cordry Out Of S. C. Contest With Hurt Knee; Doub Injured
## LaCombe Has Bad Knee, Schnetka Temporarily Laid Up; Bunn Tries Edelen, Lambert, and Cosgrove As Forwards; Meade May Play 
### 
ED with the possibility of being minus three of his stars when the
Indians tannic with the Trojan basketball team this week-end in a !
crucial two-game series, Coach John Bunn last night tried out a number j
of new men :Â»t the forward positions.
Dynamic Tommy Cordry is definitely out of the encounters with a j
badly hurt knee, which may be a partial fracture. Bill Schnetka is laid j
up with a cold, hut he should be out in time to help in the fall of Troy. !
Bill Doub is feeling the effects of a thigh injury which the medics are I
watching with an eagle eye. He may be out of Hie hospital by Thursday,

'and then again he may not.
LaConibe Hurts Knee
To cap things ofT nicely, LaConibe j
came out with a bandage on that!
trick football knee, but at least he
didn't seem to favor it much. If the
pedal extremities hold up, "Frenchy"
ought to show Jerry Nemer, the I
Trojan scoring ace, a few tricks in
the art of garnering high-point j
honors.
The loss of Cordry is a blow that
hurts, but with the prospect of j
there being an even chance that |
the other three will be back in time \
for the series, Farm fans are refus- '
ing to concede anything better than |
even money.
Coach Bunn, just back from the
j southern metropolis where he
watched S.C. give the Bear a nice
| sound trouncing, showed the boys
lhat the evening wasn't all fun and
i frolic by giving them an hour's
! clialk-t;'ik which was calculated to
i give them a first-hand knowledge of
! the invaders' offense and defense.
Trojans Play Hard
2'i'oy, judging by its performance
j against California, goes in first of
all for hard basketball, secondly for
i strategy, and lastly for straight bas
ketball without any of the intricate
1 formations displayed for the edifica- j
I tion of the fans by the Bruins.
Following the skull drill, Bunn '
! rotated Edclen, Lambert, and Cos- |
| grove at right forward. Edelen is j
rated as a guard, but he knows
! enough basketball to handle the
! forward berth nicely. Lambert al
i ternated between the first and sec
! ond teams so rapidly that it is hard
i to say just what he can do. Cos
j grove, who is usually associated
with the varsity tennis ladder,
I looked good in the time that he
' worked at the position with ihe first
; string.
Coach Bunn also had his guards
I shifting from one outfit to the
| other, working Norgard and Baker,
I Baker and Rintala, and Norgard and
i Tod in those combinations.
Meade May Play
j Another hope that may or may
I not work out is the chance that
I Reggie Meade will be in shape to
j take over Cordry's assignment,
i Meade was the dead-eye of the
' freshman team his first year, and
! his floorwork is second to none, but
! he has been sick most of the week
and it is a question whether or not
! he can get in shape in time to be of
| much use to the team.
