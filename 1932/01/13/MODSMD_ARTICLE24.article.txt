Ending all in a blaze of glory,
reminiscent of a flaming Viking
Ship, a L'ght-green Model T
Ford Coupe belonging to John
Herndon, 119 Toyon, early last
night was partially demolished
by fire.
Gable Oiler, janitor at Toyon,
whose prosaic life ordinarily
does not include fire-fighting,
rushed to the rescue. After a
short but thorough drenching
from a nearby fire hose ihe
charred "Vanishing American"
sat tragically alone -regretting
almost that its life should be
prolonged until an inglorious
junk-heap verdict be pro
nounced.
Rain, possibly causing a
short-circuit, was advanced as
a theory for the conflagration.
