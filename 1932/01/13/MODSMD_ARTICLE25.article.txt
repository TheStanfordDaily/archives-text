# SHELLEY TELLS DRAMA VALUES
## Play Action Should Include Audience, Is Claim 
### 
"An actor who works on the
theory that the action of the play
does not include the audience is
working on a scientific and not an
artistic basis," said Dr. James Shel
ley, New Zealand professor, in a
lecture last night in the Assembly
Hall on "Drama and Life." The pre
sentation was one of the regular
Tuesday Evening programs of the
Public Exercises Committee.
Dr. Shelley said that "When
Shakespeare's plays were first acted,
there was no separation between
the actors and the audience; the
spectators grouped around the act
ors, and thus asides and soliloquies
were in order.
We cannot be certain that the
modern separation of actors and
audience is a good thing. When the
two are closely identified there is a
sort of osmosis, an intimate assimi
lation of the drama that results in
dramatic values not possible when
there is complete separation of the
two. Plays in which the audience
does not feel part of the action are
like movies, in which the spectators
are unidentified with the situation.
"It is only to the extent that the
play possesses us, the extent tt!
I which we lose ourselves in the
drama, that it becomes enjoyment
and brings us dramatic satisfaction.
The fourth wall of the stage should
include, not exclude, those who
have come to watch."
Dr. Shelley said that when a child
plays soldiers it is a form of the
I drama. He pointed out that the
i child enjoys playing soldiers be
| cause he likes to belong to a group
j and because he likes to have the
high qualities which he attributes
Jto the heroes.
