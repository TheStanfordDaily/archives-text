The tendency amo hi* ;il! of us lo scoff al Ilia idea of
passing a compulsory losl before being allowed lo venture J
upon placid Lagunila in ;i canoe is something lo think twice j
about.
Not so many years ago I lie campus was startled with tlioi
realization that the calm waters had claimed a human life, i
Almost needless lo mention, a great deal of care was taken,
for a lime at leas', lo see that people who desired to go i
<anoeing were properly e([uipped with experience and an
ability to swim.
Lagunila is not dangerous lo the majority of us, hut!
there are some nevertheless to whom the deep water in
certain parts of the lake is a positive menace. We refer to
people who like lo go canoeing hut who cannot swim.
The only effective way yet devised to protect those who
fail to realize the danger is the canoe test. Take it and like
it. Your certificate is your insurance policy.
