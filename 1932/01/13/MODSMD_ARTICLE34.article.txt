# PITY THE PROFESSORS
## 
### 
The Daily Tor Heel, campus organ of tlie University of
North Carolina, in furthering the rare privilege enjoyed
by students :it that school of telling the professors exactly
what they think of them, is conducting a series of articles
giving the consensus of student opinion of each course for
each department listed in the university catalogue.
The course-resume's are short and to the point, appear
ing in the following form :
"Chemistry '31
A cook-book course. Dr. Dobbins is very in
ducive to sleep A good guesser can make
an A."
What an aid to students would be such a directory in
which one could learn with a few seconds reading what
now lakes a quarter of silent suffering to discover.
