# IS THIS THE YEAR?

### 
It's a long lane that has no turning, and Stanford,
though the basketball season is still in its infancy, finds
herself knocking at the door of a Pacific Coast Conference
championship. At least, the Redshirts can be considered
a one-two choice for the title, after having stepped awav
to a living start by trouncing Dick Linthicum and four
other guys wearing I .C.1,.A. uniforms .
Southern California invades the Farm next Friday and
Saturday nights, and just what the Indians will do in the
race will be decided in our own Pavilion right then and
there. A twin victory over the Trojans will give Stanford
a nice comfortable lead over the rest of the teams, and
that lead would turn the trick as far as John Hunn is con
cerned. For, despite California's bad start, the experts tab
the llluc and Gold the team to beat. Nibs Price's quintets
always come with a rush in mid-season, and Stanford will
be fortunate if the team it faces is the same one that tost
two games to the Trojans.
Hut meanwhile, K1 Trojan himself has to be considered
Ibis week-end. The way to beat the southerners is to gel
the jump 011 them; their stalling tactics do not work half
so well when they are trailing the opposition. If the Red
shirts can get the jump on them Friday night they will have
that elusive Conference championship half won.
