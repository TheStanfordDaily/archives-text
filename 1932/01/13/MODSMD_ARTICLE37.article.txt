"That course is just a string of
definitions separated by thick slices
of baloney," remarked a tired stu
j dent as he walked out of a four
i hour final last quarter. Many
■ courses are just that and no more,
unfortunately. Other courses do
substitute real meat for the ba
loney; but keep the staggering
number of definitions anyway.
The learning by (he student of
long lists of technical terms has
. only two values. First, those that
j can remember them can slip them
j on their friends, who of course will
f not understand them. This may,
J however, give some petty soul in
| tense joy and a swelling feeling of
! personal importance. If it does, at
1 least one person is happy. Second,
[ they may be necessary for the ma
; jor who plans to specialize in his
work; the easiest way for any sci
entist to show his mastery of his
subject to a layman is a large num
ber of four-syllable words. Further
ther than that, it is probably essen
tial that he know technical terms
j in conversing with his fellow work
ers and in studying advanced trea
j tises.
