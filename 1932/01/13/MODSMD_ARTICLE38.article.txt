# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
now we're starling 1 to wonder
about this lake of ours up here
in hack of roble its getting to be
i a debatable question whether j
its worth the trouble or not be
cause it really could be a lovely j
sylvan spot for poetic minded j
people but instead it is infested
yes badly infested not with mo- j
! squitoes yet because its too cold but |
| infested with dozens of geologists j
| tearing around deciding how many'
j cubic feet of mud will be swallowed !
Iby spring swimmers and infested !
Iby amateur pearl divers that is j
| there are some noble youths trying |
j to retrieve a valuable purse that a i
i lovely sponsoress lost there when I
\ she walked into the lake by mis
i take at least we hope it was a mis- j
' take how could anyone want to j
J walk into it it would be a dirty
| place for suicide
Â«
maybe though that new class
in (ly casting or angling or bait
ing hooks or whatever it is
| going to use the lake for its ,
official laboratory although the
j best they can hope to catch in
i the daytime is pollywogs and
i waterdogs weve heard of ang
ling and baiting hooks in lagu-
I nita before but it was never of
ficially supervised before
_
I meanwhile roble is having a two
day recess to cool off and the'

greecians have an equal chance to
warm up a jazz hound would say
hot but were always conservative
anyhow this is an official day of
silence what a lot of loud hollering
there would be if someone smiled
at her own little sister today such
a lot of hooey what are little sisters
in roble for at rushing time if not
to talk about big sisters not at roble
as you may have noticed this
is not a particularly devout
gang of intellectual hoodlums
you re living with hut we here
by humbly beg that sometime
within the next forty eight
hours each of you kneel in
front of or behind or near the
famous old cordry family totem
pole and threaten it with vio
lence if tommy isn't quite ok in
I time to throw things in the tro
jans faces friday night life is
just one darn thing after an
other

windjammer has felt kind of low
the last couple of days weve bought
aspirin and a cold chisel and every-
thing else advised but still we
sneeze you will forgive our stupid
ity then were all out of unemployed
| apples here at the daily too all con
tributions will be gratefully re
ceived by the associate editors we
