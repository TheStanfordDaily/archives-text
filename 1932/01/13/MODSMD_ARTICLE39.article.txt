STRATFORD PLAYERSâ€”At the
Columbia Theatre, San Francisco.
If the merit of the Shakespearian
season in Sail Francisco can be
measured by the delight.fulness of
the opening production, "A Winter's
Tale," Monday night, a great suc
cess can be safely predicted for Ihe
Stratford-Upon-Avon Festival Com
pany.
The play, being one of contrast,
appeals to varied moods and in
terests. Randle Ayrton ably plays
the heavy lead in the role of King
Leontes, and his queen portrayed
by Dorothy Massingham does an
admirable bit of statue work in the
last act.
Hilda Coxhead, as Perdita, and
Gyles Is ham, as Florizel, are stars
of the gay and colorful shepherd
scene which is artfully tinted and
grouped.
If you are hungry for a pleasur
able evening's entertainment, the
Stratford Players are the "white
angel" you are seeking. - E.E.11.
