# Frosh Scrimmage For Cal-Stanford And Gael Series
## BABES WORK OUT SPEEDY OFFENSE, ACCURATE PASSES Baby Gaels And Stockton Preps Rate Favorites Over Indian Five 
### 
With the first game of the Cali
fornia-Stanford freshman series
looming jusl ten days away, and a
toughish looking week-end with the
St. Mary's frosh and the Stockton
quintets in store, Coach Vance
Fawcett sent his yearling basket
squad through their paces against
Ihe Piielps-Tei kel team yesterday.
In spite of dogged defensive work
by Frank Cox at forward, and
Butte at guard, the Palo Alto five,
headed by several former Stanford
stars, maintained a slight edge
throughout the scrimmage.
Show Fast Offense
The Papooses repeatedly broke
through the Phelpt-Terkel defense
and carried the fight down under
the basket, but failed to turn their
superior fioorwork to scoreboard
points. They displayed better pass
ing than in any previous encounter.
The improvement of Frank Cox
should mark a hot three-cornered
scrap with Wally Crowe and A1
Page for one of the forward posi
-1 ions.
Tough Invaders
Fawcett has been emphasizing
passing and shooting in preparation
for the Stockton and St. Mary's in
vasion this Friday and Saturday. Of
the two, Stockton High is likely to
prove the more dangerous. Boasting
a 27-4 victory over Lowell, San
Francisco prep champions, they
claim the strongest squad in the
San Joaquin Valley, and remain
undefeated after nine starts.
Although of doubtful value, com
parative scores will give an indica
tion of their strength. The Palo Alto
High five tipped the Indians' canoe
over just last week, and were then
swamped by Lowell, the latter
hieing rather roughly handled by
the Stockton youngsters in a 27-4
tilt.
Nothing ny.ich is known of the
Gael Babes, but judging from for
mer Moraga teams Uiey can't be
classed as pushovers.
The Stanford frosh club is com
posi'd of inexperienced players.
The ir smooth development is en
tirely satisfactory to Coach Vance
Fawcett.
