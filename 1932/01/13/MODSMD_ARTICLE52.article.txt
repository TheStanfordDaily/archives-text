## Football Fatalaties May Be Materially Reduced by Elimination of Flying Wedge Feature 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Forty deaths from football in one
season! It sounds like a terrific in
dictment against America's favorite
fall sport, but when you analyze the
list you discover that only about
eight of these deaths have occurred
in organized football games played
by well-conditioned, trained teams.
When a youngster is killed by a
truck while playing football on the
street, or when a boy dies who
plays, say twice a week, in a sand
lot game, then those who make the
rules, coach the men, and super
vise the games in intercollegiate
football can in no wise be held re
sponsible.
I am sure the coaches all agree
that even one death from college
sport is a lot too many, and that
they are more th;u\ ready to make
any move that will eliminate avoid
able injury without changing the
game into tag football. The sport is
necessarily a rough one—any game
in which there is bodily contact is
bound to result in injuries—and

} when you have 528 college squads
and approximately 700 high-school
squads in action for three months,
j you arc bound to have many hurt,
; some seriously.
More people are killed each foot
ball season going to the games, or
coming from them, in travel acci
dents than are killed in the games
themselves. I have no patience with
1 the remarks of the editor of the
Columbia "Spectator" that so many
football fatalities must necessarily
jbe viewed as murder. The editor,
1 Reed Harris, claimed that the game
j was "so nicely arranged for the mob
in the stands that the players have
become human sacrifices.
Perhaps returning the high tee on
( the kick-off would do away with
the "flying wedge" play with which
the receiving side returns the ball,
as it would give the kicking side
! more time to get down the field to
; prevent the wedge being formed.
Maybe they ought to eliminate the
! kick-off altogether.
