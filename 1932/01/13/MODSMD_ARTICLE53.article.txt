# CLUBMEN GIVEN ODDS IN MURAL TRACK FRACAS
## Encina Team May Give El Toro And Breakers Competition 
### 
Willi the running of the pre
liminaries in the 440 and the
relay this afternoon at 4:15
o'clock the final preparations
for Friday's intramural track
meet will he completed. Quali
fying trials in all other events
except the distances were run
off last quarter, and only men
who have qualified or signed up
will he allowed to compete in
Friday's finals.
The threatened rivalry between
Breakers and El Toro for team
honors still dominates the meet, al
though there is a slight chance that
the group of freshmen representing
Encina 3E will give the club men
a scare or two. The frosh are not
allowed to run as one â–  team, but
must represent the particular sec
tion of Encina in which they live.
Since Blackman, Schween, Stein
er, Lapidus, Bowles, Boyd, and
Vincent all abide in the east end
of the third floor of Encina, their
team has an outside chance of cop
ping the meet.
Breakers, the defending cham
pions, boast a squad that includes
Gordon, Ferrie, Fullenwider, Har
wood, Dick Philippi, Johnston,
Morentin, and "Red" Cross. There
is also a chance that Penny Austin,
the new varsity high-jumper, will
be allowed to compete, but his case
will not be decided till this evening.
El Tcro's hopes received a big
boost at the end of last quarter
when Dean Stallings joined the
club. Shillings should be good for
points in both hurdle races and the
high-jump and pole-vault. In addi
tion, Toro will be represented by
Wright, Byrd, Herbert, Mearns,
Hundley, Reed, and Carley.
