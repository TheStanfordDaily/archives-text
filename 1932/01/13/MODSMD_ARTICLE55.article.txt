# GLEDHILL GAINS NO. 2 RANKING IN STATE LIST
## First Ten Players Include Three Bruins Against One For Cards 
### 
Keith Gledhill, Cardinal racquet
captain., is officially ranked second
in the state for 1931, below only
Ellsworth Vines, U.S. amateur
.champion. Along with the Trojan
sophomore, he is right on top in
the doubles, however, followed by
Stolen and Tidball, Stratford and
Holman, Chandler and Hillis, and
Levy and Neer.
lii the singles, "Bud" Chandler,
highest northern California ranker
for 193.1, is placed third on the all
state list, notwithstanding the fact
that he held the championship in
1930 and that he lost the 1931 state
tournament to Vines in the finals.
Further down the ladder come,
in order, fourth, Gerald Stratford,
then Alan Harrington, Lester Stoe
fen, Jack Tidball, John Murio, El
bert Lewis, and Cliff Robbins,
tenth. The glaring point about these
rankings from the Stanford point of
view is the dangerous array of
U.C.L.A. netsters in the first ten.
No less than three Bruins stuck
their noses up into the first ten in
1931, and will face an Indian squad
placing only one man in the first
twenty.
Alan Herrington, number five, is
a former Indian player, and Phil
Neer, 16th this year, was national
intercollegiate champion, from Stan
ford in 1921. Dolph Muehliesen, for
mer California star and consistently
up with anything Stanford could
offer when he was representing the
Golden Bears, is ranked 13th
