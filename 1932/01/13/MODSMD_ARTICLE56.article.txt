"Tough luck, Nibs."
j Southern California had just up
set the California basketball quintet
j for the second time in as many
| games, und Coach John Bunn, who
j had gone to Los Angeles for Mon
| day night's fray, greeted Coach
i Price of the Bears thusly:
"Tough luck nothing, John," re
| plied his nibs disappointedly. "The
j boys just weren't playing basket
-1 ball."
And that seems to be the story
| of the Trojans' surprising wins over
! the favored Bears. California, with
j apparently the " greatest potential
j strength in the southern division of
i the conference, has yet to show
I anything of the class that may be
j expected.
It is hard to believe that the
! Berkeley five won't find its stride
I soon, but unless it does by this
' week-end, when the Bears and
| Eruins clash in two games at Los
! Angeles, it may be too late for Cali
! fornia to figure in the conference
j race.
J On a basis of last week-end's
j play, Bunn looks for U.C.L.A. to
j "take" the parent institution, unless
| the Price organization shows a com
j plete reversal of form.
Meanwhile the Indian coach
expects a pair of tough battles
from the Trojans here Friday
i and Saturday.
Like California, U.S.C. has a
team of veterans, only cine man,
I Caldwell, being missing from
last year's combination. Get
ting away to a slow start on
their barnstorming tour of the
middle west, the Trojans re
turned to show that they had
profited from their experience.
While employing their notori
ous slow tactics in the first half
| of the opener with California,
the Southerners displayed great

speed in the second period for
most of Monday night's tilt.
Considerable roughness marked
both contests, however.
Price picks Stanford to win
this week's games, but his pre
diction was made before it be
came known that "Tiny Tom"
Cordry was injured.
"Frenchy" LaCombe is starting in
where he left off at Menlo last
year. In 11 junior college conference
games, the Frenchman rung the
hoop for a grand total of 126 points,
or an average of approximately
11! tallies per game.
In the two conference games
played jo far this season, LaCombe
has accounted for 18 points, eight
in the first game against U.C.L.A.
and 10 in the second. That averages
just a basket and a half short of his
last season's pace, and in much fas
ter competition.
Since he has yet to reach his
peak of form, the "frog" may equal
or better his Menlo record. When
he is right he keeps the basket hot.
Against Oregon State, for instance,
he was high with 21 tallies.
No longer will the faculty
have all of that choice little
"50-yard line" section on the
east side of the Pavilion for
their own at basketball games.
With San Francisco scribes
taking greater interest in Stan
ford basketball than heretofore,
the press section on the opposite
side of the house has proved
too cramped. Don Liebendorfer,
public relations counsel of the
Hoard of Athletic Control, plans
to allot the front row of the
faculty section to the press.

In the two conference games
played jo far this season, LaCombe
has accounted for 18 points, eight

just a basket and a half short of his
