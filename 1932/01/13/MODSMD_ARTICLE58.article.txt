Fiery fountains of lava spouted from the lake of boiling lava shown
here in the pit of Kilauea volcano on the island of Hawaii during its
latest series of eruptions. The molten lake covered 80 acres and on
the left is a fountain 175 feet high. The white streaks are red hot lava
flowing over a cooling crust.
