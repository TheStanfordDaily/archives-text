HANKOW, China, Jan. 12. f/P» —
Chinese pirates boarded a Standard
Oil Company launch 130 miles
above Hankow in the Yangtze rivet
today and were driven off by the
American gunboat of Oahu.
The brigands attacked the boat
in midstream, captured it, and held
four of the crew for ransom. They
had begun to loot the vessel when
the Oahu appeared in ihe distance.
They tied over the side but fired
the launch before they left. The
American crew was saved but only
after the boat was badly damaged.
