# STATE TO PLAY CUPID'S ROLE IN BIG DOWRY BILL
## New York Solons Propose Measure To Increase State Baby Crop SOLONS FEAR BIGOTRY Birth Control Held Cause Of Progeny Decline

NEW YORK, Jan. 13. (A')â€”' The
lawmakers of this State are con
sidering taking on the roles of
(lipids in order to do something
about (lie bachelor situation in both
male and female circles. A "dowry
hill," it was learned today, will he
introduced into the Legislature
when that body convenes next
month and its aim will he to get
young people married at a biologi
cally suitable age.
The measure to assist and encour
age marriage at an early age is
being sponsored by Captain Julius
Holchfelder of Brooklyn, and will
he introduced by Assemblyman
Maurice Z. Bungard.
The bill provides for an insurance
policy to be taken out by the par
ents of a child on its first birthday
and made payable to the child on
its 21st birthday. The State would
pay a share of the dividends and
the sum nf money would be for the
specific purpose of entering into a
matrimonial alliance.
IMan Not Compulsory
The projected bill, according to
its sponsors, would not be a com
pulsory measure, but would merely
provide an aid to far-sighted par
ents in promoting the marriage of
their offspring at a point in their
lives when marriage is often con
templated but not always carried
out because of economic reasons.
The economic depression, the
maintenance of higher standards of
living and the comforts of small
bachelor apartments in a city where
both men and women are permitted
to lead as individual lives as they
please, has knocked the bottom out
of the marriage market and thereby
sent the birth rate skidding down a
sharp decline. There were only
about 52,000 marriages in New York
City last year, a decline of approxi
mately 10 per cent over 1930.
Birth Kate Declines
A number of factors, including the
spread of birth control information,
have been found to be responsible
for the shortage in New York's baby
crop. The tendency of both young
men and young women of this city
to shift for themselves and steer
clear of the entanglements of matri
mony, however, is believed to be
the outstanding reason for the low
birth rate.
The idea for the "State dowry"
originated in New York University
when Dr. Rudolph Binder, now
professor emeritus of sociology, was
meeting classes.
Fears Political Angle
"Ethically and abstractly," said
Dr. Binder, "the bill is good, but
with our rotten policies and politi
cal favoritism I do not know how it
would work out. Health and re
spectability requirements would
have to be demanded of the par
ents. This might lead to political
favoritism in the selection of par
(ills to whom the privilege would
be accorded."
