shod" over Federal laws was made !
j before the House Judiciary Com-
I mittee today by Representative I
, Patman, Texas, Democrat, but was :
! stricken out of the record on the ■
| suggestion of Chairman Sumners.

i veteran Treasury head for "high j
j crimes and misdemeanors." Rcpre- j
I senative Michener, Michigan, Re- i
j publican, asked at one point why 1
he had not taken his charges to the
Justice Department.
Texan Answers Query
The Texan replied that since the
I department "has let him run rough j
i shod over the law as I believe, what
, reason would I have to expect it j
! would make a criminal prosecu
j tion?"
| Another Democrat, Representative ,
Oliver, of New York, requested that >
{ the statement be stricken from the
, record.
J Patman said he expected to show
j malfeasance on the part of the sec-
I retary before he concluded.
Unfair, Dyer Says
Representative Dyer, Republican,
Missouri, said it was unfair to make
i inferences of corruption without
presenting such proof.
Palman was asked whether he
: intended to chai'ge "corruption,
' fraud, or malfeasance in office."
"Before I get through 1 will do J
| it," Patman replied.
"I not only allege he has been
I indirectly concerned in carrying on
! business, but I believe I can prove
that he has directly concerned him- I
I self in carrying on that business."
