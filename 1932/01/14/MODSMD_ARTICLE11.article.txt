# Hasty Plunges Enliven Early Lagunita Season
## 
### 
With a record of but seven Stan-
I ford men and one stray dog who
i have fallen into Lagunita since its
i official opening, Stanford's only
' watering place can boast a highly
; successful season t:i date. All of the
. casualties occurred in the first few
I days of canoeing, and since that
! time practice has made perfect and
j none have unintentionally visited
! the icy waters.
However, several intrepid pub
! licity hounds of both sexes have
j chanced catching pneumonia by
I swimming in the lake. In fact, one
| young Robleite could not resist the
appeal of the muddy depths even
i though canoeing in full street at
tire. Doffing her bracelets and in
true Helene Madison style, she dove
| off and modestly swam about for
half an hour with all her clothes
on. Whereupon, dripping but happy,
she returned to Roble and a cold
! shower.
Much to the disgust of the purse
searching divers, the mud has not
yet settled to the bottom of the
| lake and Lagunita still resembles

1 the Mississippi in flood time. For J
• the first time in two years the lake I
j is full and overflowing, as the re- !
! cent rain has raised Lagunita's level j
j about eight inches.
; Although swimming has been
j popular with but a few of the hardy,
canoeing has found more adherents,
i and about eight rental boats arc.
| hired every week day. Over the I
week-end, some fifteen canoes were i
j rented, while most of the various j
i organizations' boats are in daily
i use. At the present time, nearly all
j of the houses, clubs, and halls' have!
rescued their weather-beaten craft |
from their various hiding-places
i and have brought them over to the I
I Lagunita boat house.
The rule that only those who j
! have passed the necessary tests may !
j canoe on Lagunita is still being
; enforced by A1 Throndson and;
I Frank Booth, who are in charge of j
I the lake. It is now possible for i
women as well as men to take the j
I tests, and the number of canoeists j
should increase when more people ]
j pass the tests and warm weather
returns.
