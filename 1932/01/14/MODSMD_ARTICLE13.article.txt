## McFadden Charges Scheme "To Gorge Treasury” 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (/P) —
Representative McFadden, Pennsyl
vania Republican, who bitterly as
sailed President Hoover's debt mor
atorium, today said the President's
$2,000,000,000 reconstruction bill was
"unfit" for consideration.
"This is a scheme," he said, "for
gouging $500,000,000 out of the
Treasury of the United States. It is
a scheme for taking half a billion
dollars of the people's money and
giving il to a supercorporation for
the sinister purpose of helping a
gang of financial looters cover up
their tracks.
McFadden is ranking Republican
on the Banking Committee which
framed the bill before the House.
Charges "Looting"
"It is a scheme," he said, '"for
giving these financial looters a
chance to dispose of evidence which,
if brought into the light of day,
would cause the doors of our Fed
eral penitentaries to close upon them
for a long term of years."
Over a hundred House members,
present when McFadden spoke, sat
silently and intent during his re
marks.
Rank Bill Amended
"After wrecking the business fab
ric of the country, the looters now
come forward with a scheme for
taking over the remaining property
values of the entire United States,"
he said.
The Senate amended the Federal
land bill to allocate $25,000,000 of
the $125,000,000 it would provide to
the specific purpose of extending
the time within which hard pressed
farmers may pay their installments
to the land banks.
