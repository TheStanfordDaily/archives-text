# DELIGHT MINGLED WITH CHAGRIN ON RECEIPT OF PRIZE
## 
### 
Fame, elusive lady, paused
to louch a pink finger tip to
the Chappie office yesterday,
with the announcement of Col
legian Don Cameron as the
only student winner in a na
tional floor-wax contest, and
the arrival of his hard-won
prizeâ€”a $39.50 mechanical
floor-waxer.
This housewifely piece of
equipment, enough to make
any bride's heart skip with
joy, is lodged out of sight in
its new possessor's campus
bedroom, and is offered for
sale at reduced price, or for
rent by the day or week.
His prime object is to get rid
of the handsome but ill-fitting
award. Cameron admits that
he will swap it for a baby
buggy, Ford, canoe, or ticket
to next year's Big Game; he is
also willing to hire it out to
fraternity houses who find
trouble in keeping ambitious
sophomores busy. The shining
prize is one of a thousand
given throughout the nation to
writers of best floor-wax es
says.
