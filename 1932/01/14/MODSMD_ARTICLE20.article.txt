# HORSE EMULATES POE'S RAVEN ON SORORITY STEPS
## 
### 
Insomnia or neuroses may
account for one of the most
bizarre cases of mistaken ident
ity recorded in the Daily's an
nals.
The dramatic episode took
place at 5 o'clock yesterday
morning on the Theta front
steps, when the cold grey si
lence enveloping this house
was abruptly broken by a
sharp staccato tapping. A few
moments later, the Thetas, as
sembled to investigate the in
sistent knocking, collapsed as
the head of a horse leered
quizzically through the front
door.
Traffic Officer Gordon Davis
and Night Officer George
Burns took charge of the evi
dently confused caller. Frater
nity initiations may have some
bearing on this incident. Freud
also might have something to
say.
