The issue is now squarely up to Pan-Hellenic. Thai au
gust body has passed every possible rule calculated to keep
the current rushing season honorable and above-board.
Hut on page one, the Daily records the shameful violation
of these rules bv those stormy petrels of the Five Hundred, 1
the Thclas.
The facts are these. At approximately six o'clock yes-;
lerdav morning (iordon Davis, campus arm of the law, was
aroused by a telephone call purporting to come from tlie i
Theta house. It informed him thai there was a horse,tied
outside the house, and would he please come and take it
away?
Davis did as he was asked, and the horse is now enroute ]
to the if hie factory, but that does not lessen the seriousness
of the situation. Whether the Thetas were secretly rushingi
the equine, whether some member of a rival sorority noted
this violation of the silence period and squealed, or whether
the horse merely chose to get out of the rain and chose the j
Theta house for a shelter, is a matter for Pan-Hellenic to de
cide. Hut if Row women cannot talk "out-of-bounds" to
new women during fall quarter, or to old women during
rushing, there must be something forbidding the Thetas i
from talking to horses, or even knowing what a horse looks |
like. Certainly, the nag was "out-of-bounds."
Even if Pan-Hellenic doesn't punish anybody, it ought
to take steps to keep the horse out of sororities. Imagine
what the Thetas would feel if they learned that the Alpha]
Phis had the horse up for dinner!
