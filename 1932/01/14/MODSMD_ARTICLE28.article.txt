Out of the effete East, that self-styled center of culture
and freedom, conies the report of a furore aroused by the
efl'ects of modern jazz music.
The French club of Barnard College, a girls' school in
connection with Columbia University, hired a popular or
chestra for a dance just before Christmas. The orchestra
as is customary in these "evil times," played lengthy dances
of the usual sort. •
Three feminine chaperones, probably obsessed bv
Freud's libido, noticed that the girls were inclined to Jean
their heads on their partners* shoulders and their partners,
only to willingly, responding.
When the orchestra blared into "Minnie the Moocher,"
that torrid fox-trot of casino jazz kings, the chaperones
could no longer endure the outrageous spectacle. They
rose in a body and issued direct orders to the orchestra.
The music immediately slowed down and, the couples
no longer feeling the impulse to snuggle, all went well for
the remainder of the evening.
A few days later a Barnard dramatic society held a
dance. There enthroned upon the dais, to the indignation
of all who attended, was not a regular dance band but a
string ensemble! The dance committee had been informed
that il had better not engage a boisterous orchestra. Inci
dentally, nearly all the dances were waltzes with a time
limit.
This is not written either to uphold or condemn modern
jazz but to point out that among certain classes of people
the winds of freedom are conspicuous by their absence.
