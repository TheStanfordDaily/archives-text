# BULL SESSION
## BEER VS. GIN 
### 
People discussing public questions |
are very loathe to call a spade a
spade. The congressman who wants i
a federal appropriation for his baili- |
i wick goes into elaborate details why
the improvement he wants will 1
prove a benefit to the nation and a
j boon to mankind. Everybody knows ,
that he wants the improvement bc
! cause everybody always wants any
and everything Ihey can get for
i nothing from Washington. Yet be—
' cause we shy from expressing our !
; natural and normal feelings, be- j
: cause v/e actually deny the motives j
j that prompt us—men in public life |
| are forced to resort to all sorts of i
i Ballyhoo, Hooey, Hullabaloo, Slap
| stick —and a little Life and Liberty
| too.
In ihe matter of Prohibition, we
! find the greatest amount of this sort
I of stuff. There are more foolish
; reasons given for the repeal of the
| Eighteenth Amendment than there
1 are speakeasies in San Francisco—
j and that's going plenty high. Very
j recently, Dean Mendel I of Yale
stated that if legalized four per ccnt I
beer were brought back, college
students would not drink gin and
other forms of more intoxicating
beverages. That sounds good! It
assumes two things, however. It
i assumes that college students would
) choose legal beer rather than il
| legal gin; and that all the social
customs that have grown up around
gin-drinking would be changed.
Are either of these assumptions i
j true? The case of some freshmen!
several years ago must be stated.
These men, with the swagger of I
self-realized manhood, had been in
the habit of going to a place where [
by asking for "Joe," showing a 1

card, and all that sort of thing—they
used to drink REAL beer. It was
great stuff —real collegiate like—
and somewhat risky. Imagine their
chagrin when it was discovered that
they had been drinking NEAR
BEER all the time—served out of a
keg in oid-fashioned mugs. The case
is cited merely to show that much
collegiate drinking is a social pose
or habit—rather than a geunine
taste for good liquor.
Then the matter of cocktails; the
worthy Dean feels that this "evil"
would be eradicated by good beer.
Will the hostess who has been serv
ing cocktails for years suddenly
pass out mugs of beer to her guests
because the beer is legal? Just think
of all the cocktail shakers that
would rust on the shelves—and all
the "'mysterious formulas"— treas
ured by their inventors—that would
finally be lost to mankind.
Will the students who have car
ried flasks to dances leave them at
home and strap beer kegs on their
backs because a law has been
changed? A college generation that
can drink gin—and seem to like It—
is beyond hope of salvation by le
galized beer. The '"kick," physical
and mental, in drinking illegal gin
can never be approached by legal
four per cent beer.
Dean Mendell is probably sincere
in wishing to get good beer for his
men at Yale. He is probably correct
in feeling that the men would like
good beer; and his desire to save
them from the "clutches" of the
corner bootlegger is commendable.
Now, students drink illegal gin and
some illegal beer. Under his pro
posal they would drink illegal gin
and legal beer. No more; no less;
liitle different. —Abe Mellinkoff

In ihe matter of Prohibition, we

I of stuff. There are more foolish
; reasons given for the repeal of the

1 are speakeasies in San Francisco—
j and that's going plenty high. Very
j recently, Dean Mendel I of Yale
stated that if legalized four per ccnt I
beer were brought back, college
students would not drink gin and
other forms of more intoxicating
beverages. That sounds good! It
assumes two things, however. It
i assumes that college students would
) choose legal beer rather than il
| legal gin; and that all the social
customs that have grown up around
gin-drinking would be changed.
Are either of these assumptions i
j true? The case of some freshmen!
several years ago must be stated.
These men, with the swagger of I
self-realized manhood, had been in
the habit of going to a place where [
by asking for "Joe," showing a 1

card, and all that sort of thing—they
used to drink REAL beer. It was
great stuff —real collegiate like—
and somewhat risky. Imagine their
chagrin when it was discovered that
they had been drinking NEAR
BEER all the time—served out of a
keg in oid-fashioned mugs. The case
is cited merely to show that much
collegiate drinking is a social pose
or habit—rather than a geunine
taste for good liquor.
Then the matter of cocktails; the
worthy Dean feels that this "evil"
would be eradicated by good beer.
Will the hostess who has been serv
ing cocktails for years suddenly
pass out mugs of beer to her guests
because the beer is legal? Just think
of all the cocktail shakers that
would rust on the shelves—and all
the "'mysterious formulas"— treas
ured by their inventors—that would
finally be lost to mankind.
Will the students who have car
ried flasks to dances leave them at
home and strap beer kegs on their
backs because a law has been
changed? A college generation that
can drink gin—and seem to like It—
is beyond hope of salvation by le
galized beer. The '"kick," physical
and mental, in drinking illegal gin
can never be approached by legal
four per cent beer.
Dean Mendell is probably sincere
in wishing to get good beer for his
men at Yale. He is probably correct
in feeling that the men would like
good beer; and his desire to save
them from the "clutches" of the
corner bootlegger is commendable.
Now, students drink illegal gin and
some illegal beer. Under his pro
posal they would drink illegal gin
and legal beer. No more; no less;
liitle different. —Abe Mellinkoff
