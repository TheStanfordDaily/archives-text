THIS RECKLESS A(;E—At the
Stanford Theatre.
If you are anticipating something
in the way of flaming youth from
"this picture, because of the title,
and because Buddy Rogers, Frances
Dee, and Peggy Shannon are in the
cast, please prepare to readjust your
mind. "This Reckless Age" turns
out to be a glorification of that
backbone of the nation—the Ameri
can family.
At least that is as close as we can
come to classifying this picture.
For two-thirds of the way we were
quite baffled. For instance the open
ing scene gives every indication of
evolving a thrilling accident, killing
at least six wild, "reckless" colic is:
youths. A fender is dented. That is
all.
Charlie Ruggles comes as a tre
mendous shock, too. He is cast as a
"godfather," in a role that is ac
tually maudlin, forcing him to por
tray the character of a sweet,
quaint, dear old fellow, who believes
that life is real and earnest.
Frances Dee, as usual, is badly
miscast. She is really a very pretty,
ingenuous little thing, lacking even
the flair for sophistication, and it is,
annoying to have this star con
stantly thrust upon one in a sophis
ticated part.
However, the picture slides into
an enormous tangle at the end, and
it is diverting to watch how it all
unravels. —M.L.R.

UNDER EIGHTEEN—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Seventeen-year-old Marian Marsh

stars for the first time in this pic
ture, which is a finished production
of the trite help-the-little-girl
along play.
Marian Marsh is pretty, a good
actress, and has a quiet voice ap
propriate to her type. "Under j
Eighteen" completes Miss Marsh's ;
work for her first year on the J
screen. She was John Barrymore's j
leading lady in "Svengali" and "The j
Mad Genius" and she played oppo- !
site William Powell in "The Road j
to Singapore" and opposite Edward '
G. Robmson in "Five Star Final." j
She deserves to continue with her !
career at this rapid pace.
Harry Lauder rounds out the pro
gram with some delightful Scotch
songs but the comedy is pretty thin, j
KING LEAR—Stratford Players—
At the Columbia Theatre, San !
Francisco.
Following up their success in j
"Winter's Tale," Tuesday night, the ;
Stratford group went on to greater |
triumphs in a very satisfying pro- •
duction of "King Lear," the story :
of two old men who put their trust !
in ungrateful children; one loses his j
eyes, and the other his mind.
Randle Ayrton's Lear is close to i
perfection. He employs the trick of j
smothering certain lines and repeat- |
ing others with very great success, !
making it possible for the average >
spectator to enjoy Shakespearian !
tragedy without having a vague !
feeling that he is losing something |
of the more involved . I
The waits between scenes were ]
short, the settings were simple, and |
the costumes effective. The great I
storm scene was technically poor, j
but here again fine acting carried j
the play through.
The interpretation by Dorothy 1
Massingham of Goneril was head !
and shoulders above any other
feminine portrayal on the stage.
The fool, as acted by Geoffrey Wil
kinson, brought out the full force
of the tragedy.
"King Lear" will be given again
on January 23 anil 28. — J.H.F. ;
