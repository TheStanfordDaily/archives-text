# SUFFICIENT WATER SUPPLY FOR YEAR, SAYS TROWBRIDGE
## 
### 
With Searsville and Lagunita
lakes filled and the level of water
nearin.r the top of the dam at Felt
lake, Stanford will have sufficient
water for all domestic and irrigation
purposes throughout the remainder
of the year, it was announced yes
terday by A. L. Trowbridge, as
sistant comptroller.
Heavy rains in the Coast Range
back of the University have insured
the normal flow of streams until
May or June, and it is not expected
that waters stored in Felt or Sears
ville lakes will be drawn upon until
early summer. Postponement of ir
rigation on the campus until May
or Juno has also been made pos
sible by the heavy rains which have
fallen intermittently here since No
vember.
