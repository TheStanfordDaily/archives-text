# ALLEN TO CONCLUDE BACH "ORGAN BOOK" COMPOSITIONS TODAY
## 
### 
Warren Li. Allen, University or
ganist, will conclude his recitals
based on the "Little Organ Book"
by Bach this afternoon in the Stan
ford Memorial Church at 5:10
o'clock.
These compositions, which are
made up of Chorale-Preludes, are
essential to the understanding of
Bach's music. They were originally
compiled from Gregorian plain song
and popular folk-music in order to
give the congregation the privilege
of singing in the vernacular. They
reflect wonderfully the spirit of the
times, and no student of history can
understand the Lutheran Reforma
tion without a study of these Chor
ales.
The program today will be com
posed of the following numbers:
Lord, Hear the Voice of My Com
plaint
In Thee, Lord, Have I Put My
Trust
Tri'o-Sr.nata, No. 6, in G Major
When in the Hour of Utmost Need
O How Cheating, O How Fleeting
Hark, a Voice Saith, "All Are
Mortal"
If Thou but Suffer God to Guide
Thee
