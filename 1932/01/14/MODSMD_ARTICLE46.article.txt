WONDER WHAT tactics those
Terrible Trojan fellers will employ
this week-end in their pair of
games with Stanford.
IF they get the lead early in the
game, it is quite possible that they
will try their notorious keep-away
stunt, with the two guards tossing
the pumpkin back and forth while
the crowd moans for action.
"How about it?" we queried
Coach John Bunn yesterday.
it's all right with me," he
replied, licking his chops. "We'll
he ready for 'em."
All of which bodes no good for
those Terrible Trojan Fellers.

SEVERAL POINTS might be
registered against Coach Sam Bar
ry's system, which so held up the
first hall of the opener with Cali
fornia that only five tallies were
registered by each team.
In the first place, the National
Association of Basketball Coaches
has gene on record as condemning
any tactics which delay the game.
The very life of basketball depends
on speed—that's where it gets its
popularity with the fans.
Even supporters of the winning
team do not relish stalling, such
"strategy" never failing to bring a
storm of disapproval from the
crowd. "Like prize fight crowds"
was the way one witness described
the fans at the California-U.S.C.
game.-; at Los Angeles last week
end.
And then there's another
thing. Coach Bunn pointed out
last night that when a team
drops aggressive tactics and at
tempts to lure out the defense
of the opponents by having the
guards play catch, it is AN AD
MISSION OF WEAKNESS—an
admission that the defense of
the opponents is too strong to
pierce.

CALIFORNIA TOOK another
dumping Tuesday night, dropping a
33-to-28 decision to the Los An
geles Athletic Club five in a prac
tice game. Three regulars were out
of the lineup, however, and there
is still a chance that the Bears will
begin to function against U.C.L.A.
this week-end.
With Captain Carl Vendt on
the injured list, due to a badly
ulcerated tooth, Nibs Price may
shift his big Japanese forward,
Ted Ohaslii, to guard, according
to dispatches from the South.
This would make his lineup as
follows: Eifert and Kintana,
forwards; Read, center; Cough
lan and Ohashi, guards.
Meanwhile, Coach Caddy Works
of the Bruins plans to start Len
Wellendorf at guard in an effort to
match the height of the Califor
nia!!:;. Since his freshman year Wel
lendorf has devoted himself to foot
ball, being one of the best on the
coast last season, but is reported to
have shown great improvement at
the cage game since the first of the
.season. He was not seen in action in
the Stanford series. —L.M.C.
