# Tommy Cordry May Be Ready For S. C. Games
## DOUB DEFINITELY LOST TO INDIANS ON EVE OF FRAY Bunn Irons Out Faults In Scrimmage Between First Two Teams 
### Bob Wade 
Cheered by the possibility that
"Tiny Tom" Cordry MAY get out
of the hospital in time to get a
crack at El Trojan, Stanford's var
sity cagers went through another i
tough practice last night, polishing |
off tlvi rough edges in preparation j
for giving the invaders a warm wel- j
come.
Coach Bunn had Jack Cosgrove,
former Menlo flash, working out at
Cordry's position, and although
lacking the latter's polish he is fast
getting the hang of the Indian sys
tem.
Bunn Tries Centers
With Doub definitely out of the j
fray, Bunn tried all of his other J
four centers at the pivot position, j
If Edelen had Big Dave's reach he j
would probably get the call, but the !
elongated sophomore can out jump |
him every time. Jenkins, another |
sophomore, has been playing nice j
ball the past week and may rate !
over Hancock, although the latter j
has had more experience. However, i
if the Trojans play the same sort |
of game up here that they displayed j
against California last week-end, a :
lot of men will probably see action, j
Bunn worked the boys out at first .
offense and then defense for the j
better part of an hour, using the J
regular combination of Baker, Nor- ;
gard, LaCombe, Cosgrove, and any
one of the four centers, and then j
substituting Tod, Rintala, Glasgow, |
Meade, and Palmer. Of the substi- ;
tutes, Glasgow showed some heads- j
up ball, and was effective in break
ing up the varsity formations.
Regulars Scrimmage
Following the drill, Bunn turned
the first and second strings loose j
against each other in a regular !
scrimmage that brought out the j
faults in. rapid succession. While J
Edelen was in at center, he tried j
shifting the pivot man with Nor- !
gard on the tip-off, and the fast '
guard demonstrated that he is about |
as good at one position as the other, j
Bunn concentrated for a good part
of the practice on getting the men j
used to going up in the air under )
the basket to get the tip-ins that !
mean the difference between an â€¢
easy victory and a more than pos- !
sible defeat. If the varsity drops as j
many foul- throws through the hoop j
against S.C. as they did in practice, j
the visitors will be lucky to get even |
close in that department.
Guards Show Class
Stanford now has a couple of \
guards who can shoot as well as ;
guard the basket in Norgard and i
Baker. The former in particular is i
fast becoming a dead-eye from any j
point, and if Jerry Nemer, Troy's I
high-point man, doesn't guard any
better than the reports from the j
South would indicate, Norgard is :
likely to take the honors away from j
him.

Bill Schnetka was supposed to get
out of the hospital yesterday, which
may or may not mean that he will
be in uniform today. A week's bat
tle with a cold doesn't leave any
one feeling very well, but if he can
shake the kinks out today and to
morrow and be ready for the open
ing argument tomorrow night, In
dian stock will take a big rise.
Schnetka was playing nice basket
ball befcre the germs took him for
a ride, and he ought* to be able to
give the Southerners a tough time
under the local basket. He has the
added advantage of being from the
South, and knowing more than a
little about the system used by
Coach Sam Berry's men.
