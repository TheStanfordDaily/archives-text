(Following is the first of a series of articles on Stanford track pros

Seldom indeed can a track coach
boast Ihree men who are proficient
enough in one particular event to
be able to place in a national meet.
And still more seldom do all three
of these men return for another
year of competition. Yet perhaps
unparalleled in track history is the
present situation at Stanford, where
the supermacy of three shot-putters
who placed in last year's 1.C.4-A.
meet is threatened by a mere sopho
more.
Nellie Gray, George Grey, and
Here Laborde are the returning
veterans of national championship
calibre, and John Lyman of Santa
Monica is the man who has caused
trepidation to enter the hearts of
the 1931 stars. Of the old trio, Nel
lie Gray is the most famous, as he
was undefeated in a collegkite dual
meet all last season. Nellie's best
mark was 49 feet 3 inches, which
would have been good enough to
beat Bob Hall of U.S.C. in the
1.C.4-A. meet at Harvard. Hall won,
however, with a heave of 49 feet
inches, thus proving that a
Stanford rough has no chance what
soever at Harvard.
Hall Champion
Although Hall was declared na
tional champion (he won the shot
put in Ihe nationals at Chicago as
well as at Harvard), Gray should
be given some consideration as he
beat Hall in the Stanford-U.S.C.
meet. Perhaps Templeton's Nellie
and Cromwell's Bob should be de
clared co-champions. At any rate,
Gray's best efforts of last year, in
spite of their brilliance, are men
aced by Lyman. In fact, so serious
is blond John's threat, that the track
team has unearthed an old song
that was popular in the days of
traveling salesmen, and every af
ternoon the boys can be heard
chanting in unison: "Nellie Be
ware."
In the 1931 Little Big Meet Lyman
set a new record in the shot-put
