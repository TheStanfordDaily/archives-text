# Comes Through
## 
### 
George Grey is one of the Stan
ford "come-through" artists of last
year's 1.C.4-A, meet who made it
possible for a hopelessly outclassed
Indian track team to finish but 2
points behind the champion Tro
jans. Grey beat his best previous
mark by a considerable margin
when he threw the shot 43 feet 11
inches for a second place. In fact,
Grey was the only collegiate shot
putter ether than Hall to defeat his
teammate with the differently
spelled name all last season.
Laborde, who was taken East pre
sumably as a discus-thrower, also
surpassed 48 feet in the shot-put
and finished fourth behind Hall,
Grey, and Gray. Like both Nellie
Gray and Lyman, Laborde has an
other year of competition after this
season.
