# FRESHMAN CABERS IN LAST WORKOUT BEFORE GAEL TILT
## Indian Papooses Will Face Strong Stockton High Quintet Saturday 
### Albert Guerard 
Freshman basketball players were I
sent through another long session
yesterday, including chalk talk .Ind
offensive drill, as their last serious
Workout before they take the floor
on Friday evening for a game with
the baby Gaels, Angels, Irish, Mora
gans, or any other suitable name
for the yearling quintet of St.
Mary's. The Indian Papooses (nee
Cardinals) have another severe test
on Saturday night when they face |
the Stockton High Tarzans.
Yesterday's scrimmage was light, l
but gave Coach Fawcett a chance
to help the freshmen smooth up
their plays. While no information
is available on the St. Mary's five,
the Gaels have several former San
Francisco stars on their squad, and
should enter the game favorites over
the inexperienced Stanford quintet.
Last year the Indians defeated St. !
Mary's and Stockton by substantial j
scores, with Dave Packard, present,
varsity center, starring in both!
games.
If Fawcett's forward material 1
finds its shooting eye this week- ;
ened, there is a chance that the'
present yearlings may repeat the:
performance of the 1931 Babes, but j
their showing in practice sessions to j
date makes this a rather remote j
possibility. A victory over either J
St. Mary's or Stockton would stamp j
the freshmen as a team to be feared, j
and considerably augment chancesj
of a California series victory.
The defensive strength of Stock
ton High's five is considered its I
greatest asset. None of its opponents |
so far this year has been able to j
score over sixteen points, while the 1
Tarzans were ringing up an average ,
of nearly thirty points for each con- '
