outfits of Alpha Sigma Phi and Zeta
Psi will contest honors which at
j present are anybody's for the taking,
i the only requirement being, of
! course, a smooth, fast-moving squad
j with an eye for the baskets that can
| take advantage of the many set-ups
j offered.
Results of Tuesday's struggles
i would seem to. indicate, from com
i parative scores, that the Sigma Chi
j outfit, with a 39-2 victory behind it,
j would possibly be stopped only by
! the Phi Delts, who took the Chi Psi's
; 22-9. However, if the defending
i champs have any hopes at all, many
; a weary hour should be spent
| throwing casabas at the hoop within
; a ladius of about 4 or 5 feet. For
! such are the *set-ups which seemed
i to be habitually neglected by all
: of the men, regardless of squads, in
, the opening games.
Hoerner Stars
' A chap named Jack Hoerner, who
I by rights should be out trying for a
birth on the varsity instead of win
ning games for the Fiji's, personally
and mostly from the middle of the
floor or thereabouts scored 14 out
| of the 19 digits rolled up against
! Sequoia. Hoerner was an all-state
i high school man in Nebraska a few
| years back. He is a soph now and
, has plenty of possibilities for John
' Bunn to see.
