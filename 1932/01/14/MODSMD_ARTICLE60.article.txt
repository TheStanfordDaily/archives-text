# FOUR DELEGATES ATTEND LANGUAGE MEET IN MADISON
## Craig, Schwartz, Johnston, And Seward Represent Stanford Faculty 
### 
Professor Hardin Craig, of the
English department, returned Tues
day from a meeting of the Modern
Language Association held at Madi
son, Wisconsin, from December 28
to 30, 1931. Other members of the
faculty who returned earlier from
the meeting were Professor W.
Leonard Schwartz and Professor
Oliver M. Johnston, of the Roman
tic languages department, and Pro
fessor Samuel S. Seward, of the
English department.
Professor Craig read a paper on
"Current German Scholarship in
the Elizabethan Drama." Following
the meeting he made a personal
visit to the University of lowa
where he once taught. On January
5, 6, and 7, he delivered a course
of lectures on the Elizabethan Drama
before members of the graduate
school at the University of Illinois,
at Urbana, in which he devoted
himself mainly to graduate meth
odology in the subject. Following
these lectures he went to Chicago.
Schwartz Ileads Paper
Professor Schwartz, chairman of
the committee appointed last year
to investigate the subject of voca
tional opportunities for linguists,
submitted his findings to the Execu
tive Committee of the National
Federation of Modern Language
Teachers. According to Professor
Schwartz, mere knowledge of a for
eign language is not enough.
Professor Schwartz stated that it
is "as reasonable to seek a position
of a plumber in Paris because you
know French as it is to expect an
appointment of foreign correspond
ent if you are not a good news
paper man. Nevertheless, knowledge
of languages is a decided asset in
many fields." A full account of his
findings will appear in the March
and April numbers of the Modern
Language Journal.
Johnston Leads Section
Professor Johnston, as president,
presided over the meeting of the
American Association of Teachers
of Italian, which met on the after
noon of January 28. Earlier in the
afternoon he presided over the
Italian section of the Modern Lan
guage Association. In the evening
the American Association of Teach
ers of Italian met for dinner at the
University Club at Madison.
Professor Seward, of the English
department, read a paper before
the Modern Language Association
on the subject of "Form in Humor
ous Verse." A paper was read for
Professor Margery Bailey at the
meeting since she was unable to
attend in person.
