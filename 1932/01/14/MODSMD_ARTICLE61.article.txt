the Encina 2W basketball team, de
feated Palo Alto high school 26 to 23
last night. Moore, who is the same
man who starred on the freshman
football team, totalled a meager 22
points to make the victory possible.
The game was the first of the sea
son for the Encina 2W team, and
installs it as one of the favorites
for the intramural cage title. Al
though Palo Alto used most of its
reserves, the fact remains that the
hall boys did what the regular fresh
