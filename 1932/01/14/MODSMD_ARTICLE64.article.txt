## 
### 
"How can we help to make the i
Honor Code work?"
This was the general tenor of;
questions asked Men's Council mem- i
bers at their latest night session |
with a group of freshmen.
Confidence in the practicability j
of the Code was indicated by the |
entire group, which was the largest j
yet to assemble at the Council's be- j
hest.
"The men were very enthusiastic," |
Ed Boyles, Council secretary, said, j
"We had more questions during and '
after the meeting than ever before." |
Boyles declared that the Council
plans to complete its meetings with :
new students by the middle of the ;
quarter. Another meeting will be ;
held tonight. Freshmen who are ex- i
pected to be present have received I
cards, and anyone else who is in- i
terested is invited to attend. The i
meeting tonight is scheduled for 7:30
o'clock in the east social room at
Toyon Hall.
No new member has yet been,
selected to fill the vacancy left by
Donald Colvin, who has left Stan
ford and who will return next au
tumn.
The regular weekly Council meet
ing will be held this afternoon. Nu- j
merous traffic cases are slated for j
hearings.
