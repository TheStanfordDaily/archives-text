Making la.st seconds count up to
the final whistle, El Toro was bare
ly able to take a remarkably fast
moving, accurate-shooting Los Ar
cos quintet 21—19 last night, with
both teams gaining the lead three
limes each in rapid succession dur
ing the last five minutes of play.
Trailing 12-8 at half time, the Toro
five, after a very mediocre showing
during a sluggish first period, csme
up to make it 15-13. After this the
score seasawed back and forth two
points at a time.

A lithe forward in the person of
Tex Byrd, high point man with
eight digits to his credit, Neil Mil-

ler, and Morris Oppenheim were
responsible for a great deal of the
winning points. Stan Madden, Los
Arcos forward, took eight points for
the top scoring position and with
Jack Valentine was responsible for
most of the fancy offensive work
which almost brought home' the
bacon to the Encina Commons club.
Class of League
Thus far this season both of these
outfits stand head and shoulders
above any of the othqr competition
offered either in Leagues I, 11, or
111. Both possess a good, smooth of
fense with possibilities to develop
during the next two weeks of prac
tice and both can take advantage
of any and almost everything in the
way of set-ups that come their way.
Howie Folsom, Delta Upsilon's
high-point man, took nine of his
quintet's 13 digits scored on the
Alpha Delta Phi five in a rather
uneventful game, which was fea
tured mainly by a marked need of
practice for both outfits. This, how
ever, in the first week of play is
probably applicable to all of the
contestants thus far. Again last
night, in this affair, the baskets
that "could have been'' were not
enough to tabulate.
Phi Sigs Victorious
An active gang from the Phi Sig
house literally took an outclassed
but fighting A.K.L. group for a long,
long ride with the result 30-11.
Young George Worley, without a
doubt the best man on the floor,
acquired 17 of the 30 digits in one
of the outstanding exhibitions of
casaba-handling to date. A.K.L.'s
high-point man was Guy Cornell
with four baskets to his credit.
"Thorny" Rogers, "Chuck" Co
berly, and Charles White, with four
points each, were mainly responsible
for a 15-9 Zeta Psi win over the
Alpha Sigs in another rather slow
affair with no particularly outstand
ing work on either side. Here again
countless set-ups, golden oppor
tunities to score, were neglected by
almost everybody on the floor who
had the ball near a basket. "Pop"

Phi Sigs Victorious
An active gang from the Phi Sig
house literally took an outclassed
but fighting A.K.L. group for a long,
long ride with the result 30-11.
Young George Worley, without a
doubt the best man on the floor,
acquired 17 of the 30 digits in one
of the outstanding exhibitions of
casaba-handling to date. A.K.L.'s
high-point man was Guy Cornell
with four baskets to his credit.
"Thorny" Rogers, "Chuck" Co
berly, and Charles White, with four
points each, were mainly responsible
for a 15-9 Zeta Psi win over the
Alpha Sigs in another rather slow
affair with no particularly outstand
ing work on either side. Here again
countless set-ups, golden oppor
tunities to score, were neglected by
almost everybody on the floor who
had the ball near a basket. "Pop"

Making la.st seconds count up to
the final whistle, El Toro was bare
ly able to take a remarkably fast
moving, accurate-shooting Los Ar
cos quintet 21—19 last night, with
both teams gaining the lead three
limes each in rapid succession dur
ing the last five minutes of play.
Trailing 12-8 at half time, the Toro
five, after a very mediocre showing
during a sluggish first period, csme
up to make it 15-13. After this the
score seasawed back and forth two
points at a time.

A lithe forward in the person of
Tex Byrd, high point man with
eight digits to his credit, Neil Mil-

ler, and Morris Oppenheim were
responsible for a great deal of the
winning points. Stan Madden, Los
Arcos forward, took eight points for
the top scoring position and with
Jack Valentine was responsible for
most of the fancy offensive work
which almost brought home' the
bacon to the Encina Commons club.
Class of League
Thus far this season both of these
outfits stand head and shoulders
above any of the othqr competition
offered either in Leagues I, 11, or
111. Both possess a good, smooth of
fense with possibilities to develop
during the next two weeks of prac
tice and both can take advantage
of any and almost everything in the
way of set-ups that come their way.
Howie Folsom, Delta Upsilon's
high-point man, took nine of his
quintet's 13 digits scored on the
Alpha Delta Phi five in a rather
uneventful game, which was fea
tured mainly by a marked need of
practice for both outfits. This, how
ever, in the first week of play is
probably applicable to all of the
contestants thus far. Again last
