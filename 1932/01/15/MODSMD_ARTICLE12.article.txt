# SIFT MELLON'S HELP IN FRAUD
## Sizzling Probe Raps Huge Colombian Oil Graft 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (TP).—As
sertions that Secretary Mellon, in
his private capacity as a capitalist,
intervened last June in negotiations
to extend a loan to Colombia were
heard and at once denied today be
fore committees of Congress.

A charge that the Treasury Sec
retary was active in obtaining a
Colombian oil concession during the
loan discussions was made by Rep
resentative Patman, a Texas Demo
crat, before the House Committee
hearing his plea that Mr. Mellon
ought to be impeached. The ac
cusation was based largely on news
paper dispatches and a letter from
an unnamed citizen of Colombia.

State Department officials, appear
ing concurrently before a Senate
Committee investigating foreign
loans, denied there was any con
nection between the Colombian
credit and any oil discussians which
may have taken place. Tomorrow
Mr. Mellon's representatives will re
ply to Patman before the House
Committee.

The story of the State Depart
ment's activities with reference to
the loan and the concession was re
lated by Francis White, an assistant
Secretary of State, and Fi'eeman
Matthews, assistant chief of the De
partment Latin-American division.

White flatly refused to give the
committee for publication corres
pondence between the Department
and the Colombian legation regard
ing the oil concession. He continued
to refuse, after Senator Johnson,
Republican, California, had drawn
from him a statement that he had
read one of the communications to
a New York banker.

From Matthews, Johnson obtained
testimony that the $4,000,000 Co
lombian loan was held up by Ameri-

can bankers for several weeks and
finally granted after the State De
partment had interceded.
