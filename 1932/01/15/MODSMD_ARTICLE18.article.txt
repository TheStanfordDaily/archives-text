SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 14 </P;.â€”
Political firecrackers bursting in all
sections of the country last night
reminded the Nation that a cam
paign year had arrived.

The name of Herbert Hoover was
formally put into the Republican
presidential field today by his Post
master General, Walter Brown of
Ohio, in the face of threatened chal
lenges from the party independents
of the Northwest.

Democrats Nominate

In a terse statement Mr. Brown
said the President "will stand for
renomination" and whatever is ne
cessary to get convention delegates
for him will be undertaken.

In some fifty cities the Demo
crats held a series of simultaneous
dinners, launching their "victory
campaign for $1,500,000 to erase the
party deficit and put it in position
for a flying start after the Chicago
convention." #
Roosevelt Indorsed
Several thousand Democratic
leaders gathered at the dinner in
New York and heard Governor
Franklin D. Roosevelt, candidate for
the presidency, say the party "can
never tolerate abuse heaped upon
the person" of the President.

Roosevelt was indorsed yesterday
as the party's presidential candi
date by the resolutions committee
at the North Dakota State Demo
cratic convention.

Also- addressing the New York
meeting, John W. Davis, Democratic
presidential nominee in 1924, said
the fund-raising campaign has "no
connection even the most remote
with the aspirations of a possible
candidate."
