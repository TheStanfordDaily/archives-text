# CARDS AND EL TROJAN CLASH, RATED EVENLY
## Double Wins Throw U.S.C. And Indians In Tie For Loop Supremacy COSGROVE WILL START Coach Bunn Drills Squad To Break Up Barry's Delayed Attack 
### 
The two "dark horse" teams of
southern division conference bas
ketball, Stanford and Southern
California, meet here tonight in the
first of what promises to be one of
the most important two-game quin
tet engagements of the season.

With double wins registered by
the Indians and Trojans last week
end over U.C.L.A. and California
respectively, the two fives face each
other tonight in the Stanford Pa
vilion tied for the league leader
ship. Both squads had been ex
pected to wind up the season des
perately fighting to keep out of the
cellar, for until last Monday night
when the Trojans trampled the
Golden Bears for the second time,
the Price outfit, which copped the
championship last year, was a strong
favorite to repeat.
Bruins After Bears
On the other hand, U.C.L.A. was
considered the likely team to give
the Bears a run for their money.
Now the Bruins, who meet the
Bears tonight in Los Angeles, will
be trying to push their rivals into
the cellar instead of toppling them
from the lead.

Meanwhile, Stanford's chances of
maintaining the lead after this
week-end's encounters were some
what diminished early this week
when three men, including "Tiny
Tom" Cordry, were confined in the
Palo Alto Hospital with various in
juries. But hopes were strengthened
last night when the diminutive for
ward reported for practice.
Cordry Out to Practice
Cordry was laid up with a slight
fracture in his leg which he re
ceived in the U.C.L.A. scramble Inst
Saturday night. He looked fairly
well in practice but will not be in
the opening lineup tonight, giving
way to Jack Cosgrove, a promising
forward transferred from Menlo
J.C. Cosgrove has been showing
great improvement in recent prac
tice sessions. However, Cordry will
probably be used if the Trojans
get off to an early lead.
Stanford will face the notorious
U.S.C. delayed attack in tonight's
contest. California failed to stop it
last week, but Coach John Bunn's
Indians have already faced such an
offense in a practice game with the
Pittsburgh Panthers during the
Christmas vacation. The Pittsburgh
guards passed the ball back and
forth until Stanford tried to inter
cept; then they made a break for
the basket.
Pitt Scalps 101 Trojan
When Pittsburgh met the Tro
jans in a recent game in Los An
geles, the Panthers won, which gives
the Indians the advantage of hav
ing played a possibly better team
than the Trojans, both playing the
same system.
Bunn scouted El Trojan in the
California-U.S.C. game last Mon
day and since has drilled his charg
es in an effort to break up this
slow waiting attack.
The Stanford lineup with the ex
ception of Cosgrove for Cordry at
forward remains the same. Packard
will receive the call at center with
Edelen or Jenkins ready to relieve
him. "Frenehy" LaCombe will team
with Cosgrove at the either forward
with Baker and Norgard starting as
usual at the guard posts.
U.S.C. Arrives on Lark
'"Reggie" Meade will be ready to
take LaCombe's place if the Ter
rible Trojans have the Card scoring
ace too well covered. In the event
that Cordry is kept out of the con
test entirely, Glasgow will be Cos
grove's substitute. Schnetka, Tod,
and Rintala will probably take
turns alternating with either Baker
or Norgard in the guard depart
ment.
The U.S.C. squad of fifteen men,
with their coach, Sam Barry, will
arrive this morning on the Southern
Pacific Lark.

other tonight in the Stanford Pa
vilion tied for the league leader
ship. Both squads had been ex
pected to wind up the season des
perately fighting to keep out of the
cellar, for until last Monday night
when the Trojans trampled the
Golden Bears for the second time,
the Price outfit, which copped the
championship last year, was a strong
favorite to repeat.
Bruins After Bears
On the other hand, U.C.L.A. was
considered the likely team to give
the Bears a run for their money.
Now the Bruins, who meet the
Bears tonight in Los Angeles, will
be trying to push their rivals into
the cellar instead of toppling them
from the lead.

Meanwhile, Stanford's chances of
maintaining the lead after this
week-end's encounters were some
what diminished early this week
when three men, including "Tiny
Tom" Cordry, were confined in the
Palo Alto Hospital with various in
juries. But hopes were strengthened
last night when the diminutive for
ward reported for practice.
Cordry Out to Practice
Cordry was laid up with a slight
fracture in his leg which he re
ceived in the U.C.L.A. scramble Inst
Saturday night. He looked fairly
well in practice but will not be in
the opening lineup tonight, giving
way to Jack Cosgrove, a promising
forward transferred from Menlo
J.C. Cosgrove has been showing
great improvement in recent prac
tice sessions. However, Cordry will
probably be used if the Trojans
get off to an early lead.
Stanford will face the notorious
U.S.C. delayed attack in tonight's
contest. California failed to stop it
last week, but Coach John Bunn's
Indians have already faced such an
offense in a practice game with the
Pittsburgh Panthers during the
Christmas vacation. The Pittsburgh
guards passed the ball back and
forth until Stanford tried to inter
cept; then they made a break for
the basket.
Pitt Scalps 101 Trojan
When Pittsburgh met the Tro
jans in a recent game in Los An
geles, the Panthers won, which gives
the Indians the advantage of hav
ing played a possibly better team
than the Trojans, both playing the
same system.
Bunn scouted El Trojan in the
California-U.S.C. game last Mon
day and since has drilled his charg
es in an effort to break up this
slow waiting attack.
The Stanford lineup with the ex
ception of Cosgrove for Cordry at
forward remains the same. Packard
will receive the call at center with
Edelen or Jenkins ready to relieve
him. "Frenehy" LaCombe will team
with Cosgrove at the either forward
with Baker and Norgard starting as
usual at the guard posts.
U.S.C. Arrives on Lark
'"Reggie" Meade will be ready to
take LaCombe's place if the Ter
rible Trojans have the Card scoring
ace too well covered. In the event
that Cordry is kept out of the con
test entirely, Glasgow will be Cos
grove's substitute. Schnetka, Tod,
and Rintala will probably take
turns alternating with either Baker
or Norgard in the guard depart
ment.
The U.S.C. squad of fifteen men,
with their coach, Sam Barry, will
arrive this morning on the Southern
Pacific Lark.
