WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (IP) — ■
Representatives of two anti-prohi- ;
bition groups in the House today |
agreed they should unite in sup- j
porting a referendum on the ques- |
tion of State control of liquor. !
Meanwhile the Senate Manufac- '
lures Subcommittee heard three I
members of the House ui'ge enact- l
ment of the Bingham bill to legal- ,
ize beer with a 4 per cent alcoholic j
content. Opponents of the measure |
will be heard later.
Committees from the newly |
formed Republican organization for j
prohibition reform and the old bi- j
partisan wet bloc approved the j
referendum proposal. Both organi- j
zations will meet tomorrow to con
sider the proposition separately.
Intrastate Power
The referendum proposal would j
leave with the Federal Government |
the power to regulate or prohibit j
interstate transportation of intoxi- !
eating beverages. It would give the j
States authority to regulate the '
sale, manufacture, and intrastate
transportation of liquor.
Before the Senate committee ,
Representative Cooke, Republican, '
New York, said: "Our prisons can j
be reduced .our homes divested of :
