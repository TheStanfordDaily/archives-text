# THIS IS THE LAST ABOUT MONAHAN

### 
Graduate Maunder William Monahan of California is a
smart young man and (lie Far West is going to lose prestige
l>v all its petty biekering over the dates set for the lOIA
meet this year. So says Roy Cuminings, ('.all-Bulletin sports
writer, in denouncing Stanford's efforts to have the col
legiate meet held two weeks instead of one week, before
ihe final Olympic Games trials.
Cummings, a University of California alumnus, accuses
the Daily of painting Monahan as a "Shylock" and him
self Hays Stanford for trying to queer the works. California
is making the guarantee, and California is entitled to get
that guarantee back by not scheduling the meet just be
fore the Fourth of July holiday, says Cu minings, and Stan
ford is doing the West no good by complaining; first, be
cause the bickering will react unfavorably in the East, and
second, because a poor crowd will make it hard for the
West ever to get the meet again.

The Daily will grant the justice of some of Cummings'
points. Naturally, Monahan wants to break even if he can,
and it is true that 100 much squabbling won't make a favor
able impression. However, until this week, when he agreed
to discuss the matter together with Stanford and Southern
California authorities, Monahan had been just as adamant
in holding (.tut for the later date as Stanford has been for
the earlier one. But Cummings, not being a track coach,
does not'attempt to deny that the athletes may be under
100 much of a strain by competing in half a dozen races
twice in six days. He thinks "they ought to be able to do
it without suffering any harm."

Well, the Daily is taking the word of Dink Templeton,
among others, that, if the runners won't suffer any harm,
they certainly won't be at the peak of form for the second
meet, which is the Olympic Games trials, the most import
ant meet of the year for American athletes, barring the
(lames themselves. The Daily would also hazard a guess
that if the new California stadium isn't filled on July Ist
and 2nd by the novelty of the ICIA, it wouldn't be filled on
the Bth and 9th either. A meet of that calibre, held for the
first time on the Pacific Coast, should draw 20,(HH) people
from the Ray Region if it were held on New Year's Eve.

However, maybe California doesn't think so. Then they
can feel more certain of their guarantee, and the United
States can have some doubts as to whether its Olympic
(lames track team is a representative body. It doesn't seem
to matter vcrv much.
