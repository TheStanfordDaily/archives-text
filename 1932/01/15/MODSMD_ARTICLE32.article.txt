A number of months ago, some enterprising citizens in
and around that health resort in Arkansas, Hot Springs, got
their heads together and evolved a very clever scheme for
diverting into Arkansas as great a portion as possible of
that steady, lucrative stream of IratVic which has beaten a
broad path to Reno.
Hot Springs, already popular among winter guests and
seekers of health, should have grown immensely more
popular when the Arkansas 00-dav divorce laws went into
effect, if the backers of the bill in the legislature had real
ized llieir fond hopes.
Just why the nation's rich divorce seekers should con
tinue to shun Hot Springs seems an unanswerable ques
tion, especially since reports from lb-no indicate no de
crcase in the number of quick separations allowed there.
Maybe it is just because Reno has become the tradition.
