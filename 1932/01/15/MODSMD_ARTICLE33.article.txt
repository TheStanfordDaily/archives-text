"II is a long and sad story, in j
fact too long for our limited space
here, so to be brief, young Kilgore
soon lost all interest in his studies, ;
went to drinking, and took up gam
bling ris a profession." This is not a 1
joke; it is a quotation from some j
society's pamphlet that is seeking to;
lead people to the good and pure
life. We do not wish to deride their ;
efforts; but w e object most strenu
ously to their example being a col- j
lege student —as was young Kilgore
—before the tenacious tentacles of '
sin engaged their victim in its j
deadly grasp.
Why is it that the public is will- i
ing—yes, eager—to believe any i
dereliction that the newspapers are
willing to print about "wild college
boys and girls"? Sensational sheets
can concoct the strangest stories— j
even weird—but so long as they j
imply some violation of Puritan
ethics by collegians, the old heads j
begin to nod and sway in sad af- (
firmation. Yet if one of their own j
generation is reported seen with the
goods—particularly blonde goods
—they are apt to discredit the story

j that college students are not drop- j

; They come from the same environ

j from. They represent a cross-sec- i

One finds about the same number J
j of Republicans and Democrats here :
I as one would find any other place, j
; The same number of drinkers and j
j abstainers. The same number of I
I liberals and conservatives. The same !
1 number of those that try to think j
! and those that don't. All this may j
! sound somewhat hopeless; but it is |
; true. College students aren't much

I which many think is a good thing
