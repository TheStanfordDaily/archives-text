"LIVING PHILOSOPHIES"—Simon
and Schuster. 1 !#;] 1. $2.50.
In the words of George Jean Na
than .... "A man's beliefs, after
all, save he be a professional pi'ac
titioner of letters and hence a
racketeer of words, a self-black
mailer, and a Judas unto himself,
are and should be his private, per
sonal property."' Later referring di
rectly to the contributors to such
symposia as "Living Philosophies":
"There is about the 'beliefs' they
expound on such occasions a con
siderable air of fraud .... they
are withholding much that is true
of themselves and their private
philosophies."
In this respect, like all symposia,
critiques, or "exposes of intimate
credos," "Living Philosophies" is
disjrppointing. Nearly every essay
shows a reticent, defensive attitude,
each author realizes that his credo
will be compared, by the casual
reader, with the other "beliefs" ex
pounded in the same volume. It is
in such a spirit that the contribu
tors, twenty-two in all, have ap
proached their task.
The articles by Einstein, Russell,
Dewey, Mencken, Wells, and Keith
("a student of the antiquity of
man'') appeared to me definitely

worthwhile. Einstein's appreciation
of the world about him, and his
keen sense of the individual, Rus
sell's slory of his early life, Dewey's
philosophy of experience, Mencken's
attack on the attempts of the Milli
kans to reconcile religion sci
ence, Wells' and Keith's conceptions
of immortality; all of these merit a
second reading.
Millikan, Hilaire Belloc, Dean
Inge attempt once more to recon
cile religion and science. The other
contributors are frank and complete
disbelievers. Belloc's essay is in
teresting. It may well be so brilliant
a piece of satire as to completely
fool the average reader, or it may
indeed be a blind defense of Cath
olicism.
The essay of Irving Babbitt on
Rousseau should be skipped. It is
Babbitt's traditional attitude, more
unintelligible than ever. Of the
working creeds, the one of George
Jean Nathan v/ill attract the aver
age college student. Edman's, llal
dane's, and Mumford's articles are
certainly worth reading. —A.J.G.

A course in insurance has been
added to the curriculum of the
business school of North Carolina
State College.

keen sense of the individual, Rus
sell's slory of his early life, Dewey's
philosophy of experience, Mencken's
attack on the attempts of the Milli
kans to reconcile religion sci
ence, Wells' and Keith's conceptions
of immortality; all of these merit a
second reading.
Millikan, Hilaire Belloc, Dean
Inge attempt once more to recon
cile religion and science. The other
contributors are frank and complete
disbelievers. Belloc's essay is in
teresting. It may well be so brilliant
a piece of satire as to completely
fool the average reader, or it may
indeed be a blind defense of Cath
olicism.
The essay of Irving Babbitt on
Rousseau should be skipped. It is
Babbitt's traditional attitude, more
unintelligible than ever. Of the
working creeds, the one of George
Jean Nathan v/ill attract the aver
age college student. Edman's, llal
dane's, and Mumford's articles are
certainly worth reading. —A.J.G.

A course in insurance has been

"LIVING PHILOSOPHIES"—Simon
and Schuster. 1 !#;] 1. $2.50.
In the words of George Jean Na
than .... "A man's beliefs, after
all, save he be a professional pi'ac
titioner of letters and hence a
racketeer of words, a self-black
mailer, and a Judas unto himself,
are and should be his private, per
sonal property."' Later referring di
rectly to the contributors to such
symposia as "Living Philosophies":
"There is about the 'beliefs' they
expound on such occasions a con
siderable air of fraud .... they
are withholding much that is true
of themselves and their private
philosophies."
In this respect, like all symposia,
critiques, or "exposes of intimate
credos," "Living Philosophies" is
disjrppointing. Nearly every essay
shows a reticent, defensive attitude,
each author realizes that his credo
will be compared, by the casual
reader, with the other "beliefs" ex
pounded in the same volume. It is
in such a spirit that the contribu
tors, twenty-two in all, have ap
proached their task.
The articles by Einstein, Russell,
Dewey, Mencken, Wells, and Keith
("a student of the antiquity of
man'') appeared to me definitely

worthwhile. Einstein's appreciation
of the world about him, and his
keen sense of the individual, Rus
sell's slory of his early life, Dewey's
philosophy of experience, Mencken's
attack on the attempts of the Milli
kans to reconcile religion sci
ence, Wells' and Keith's conceptions
of immortality; all of these merit a
