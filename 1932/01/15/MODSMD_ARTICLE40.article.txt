I DUNNO," remarked Coach John j
Bunn the other night. "I dunno," i
lie repeated, "Wi . ' T will do if I ]
have U> reorganize ibis basketball I
tean, much more."
He was experimenting with sev
eral forwards in an attempt to find |
somroi: • to replace "Tiny Tom"
Cordry, in case the dynamic little
"spark plug" wouldn't be available '
for play this week-end.
And i( is little wonder that
the Indan coach "dunno." First
i( was Phil iVlofTatt, whom he
counted on for another year at
forward. Willi matrimony in the
oiling, Phil decided to graduate.
Then there was Keith Topping,
hril'.unt forward prospect of last
year's freshman team, who
dropped out of school because
of eye trouble.
And Reggie Mead, another for
ward whom Bunn had expected to
use, ha> been troubled with illness
and has yet to get in form.
That didn't leave much reserve
strength at the forward berths, but
i) did leave Cordry and "Frenchy"
LaCombe, with the aid of whom the
Indians captured the first two con
ference games.
Then Cordry got himself a
cracked fibula -and we don't blame
Bunn because be "dunno."
COACH BUNN, in an effort to
preser /e the reputation of Stanford
Pavilion crowds for sportsmanship,
ask;-: that the fans at the U.S.C.
ranies knight and tomorrow night
observe the following code of
poru.ir.anship for basketball:
\. Remain silent while a play
er is attempting a free throw.
2. Be courteous toward offi
cials and abide strictly by their
decisions.
Some departure from this code
has been noticed already this sea
sun, but with the possibility that
Iho.se Terrible Trojan Fellers will
» mploy their stalling tactics, this
warning is particularly timely.
WI-lAZZIS? FOOTBALL in Janu
ary?
Yes, Oswald, football in January.
An 1 WHAT football. The Knights
of Columbus charity grid game, set
for Kezar stadium on January 24,
will bri::.t>, together two of the most
poweri'ul teams that could be as
sembled.
Frank Carideo, the great
Notre Dame quarterback, will
have charge of an eleven to use
the Kocknc system, while our
own Ernie Nevers, the greatest
of them all, will lead a Warner
system team.
Nevers and his squad, made up
n istly from his Chicago Cardinal
professional team, will train on the
eampiv. Nevers has accepted the in
vitat >11 of Pop Warner to work out
here t'<u the week preceding the
:iiik\ and will bring his entourage
here Monday morning.
II the present tendency keeps up, j
football will be dragged out into i
baseball season in a few years.
