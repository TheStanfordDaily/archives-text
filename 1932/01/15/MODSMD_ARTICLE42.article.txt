# Frosh Ready For Tangle With Tough Moragans
## YEARLINGS RATED AS UNDERDOGS IN TONIGHT'S FRACAS Coach Fawcett Undecided On Starters; Shooting Much Improved 
### Albert Guerard 
An iron hoop two feet in diama
ter may prove the making or un
doing of the Stanford freshman
basketball team that faces two
strong quintets of the St. Mary's
freshman and Stockton High to
night and Saturday in preliminary
struggles to the conference battles
between John Bunn's Indians and
the Terrible Trojans from Los An
geles. Like their big brothers, Vance
Fawce'.t's green yearlings will enter
their week-end encounters as un
derdogs, but are confident of their
ability to bowl over the dire pre
dictions of local pessimists with a
double victory.
Inability to hit the aforementioned
iron hoop with any degree of regu
larity cost the juvenile Redskins
their two opening games against
inferior teams of Pittsburg and
Palo Alto high schools. Many long
hours during the week have been
spent by Wally Crowe, Frank Cox,
A1 Page, and Charles and Henry
Coiner, the five principal forward
candidates, in shooting baskets from
all distances and angles, and im
i provement in this department of the
game has at last begun to show.
Starting Lineup
While Fawcett's hair has yet to
turn gray in any large proportions,
one of the Indian mentor's biggest
worries has been to choose a start
ing forward combination for to
night's game with St. Mary's. Wally
Crowe's excellent fioorwork and
Frank Cox's fight have earned
these men the edge, but other
members of the forward quintet will
undoubtedly see action during the
evening.
The rest of the starting lineup in
cludes "Dud" Sales at center, and
Butte and Mallatratt, two new
guards in school for the first time
during the present winter quarter.
Stockton High School
The Indian tomahawk may find
the Stockton Tarzan scalps to be
even tougher than the Moragan va
riety. The early season record of
the prepsters marks them as the
team to beat among northern Cali
fornia high schools. Last year they
lost to the frosh, 32-26, but the
1932 Tarzans seem to have it all
! over their 1931 predecessors. How
| ever, despite the v/eek-end's fear
-1 ful aspect, the frosh five does not
1 seem to be the kind of team that
concedes a dozen or so baskets be
fore the opening whistle.
Friday's contest with the Gaels,
and the Stockton tussle on Satur
day, both start at G:3O in the Pa
vilion.
