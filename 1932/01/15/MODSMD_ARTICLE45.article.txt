# NEVERS WILL TRAIN HERE FOR KEZAR CHARITY TILT
## 
### RON KENNEDY 
Post-season though it is, if the I
Stanford campus wants to take any- J
thing more than a vicarious interest
in the great Nevers-Carideo football
contest at Kezar January 24, it can.
For Ernie himself, the great Nevers
whom Pop Warner characterized as
the finest player he ever coached,
will be here on the campus all next
week, grooming his bunch of star
gridders for their clash with the |
ex-Notre Dameons.
He said yesterday in Los Angeles
(hat he accepted Warner's invitation
to use the Stanford stadium as .a
final training ground, and he expects
to arrive here with his team Monday
morning. They will practice here
until the end of the week, when j
they will go to San Francisco for'
a day or two to get used to the j
Kezar turf.
Has Iligh-scorcr
Nevers has.gathered together some \
of the finest and most powerful foot
ball players in the country for this j
game. Himself playing his regular'
position at full, he will have with '
him in the backfield Malloys, from j
Loyola, Chicago, a mighty good |
quarterback, who may call tho sig- j
nals. At half he will have Johnnie ,
Blood, a high scorer in the National !
League this last season as a member
of the World's champion Green Bay
team, and Bonnie Belden, expert
blocker, who hails from Santa Rosa. ]
Other stellar players who will be
on the campus with the Nevers ag
gregation next week are Johnniel

1 Kitzmiller, former Oregon flash;
{ Elmer Schwartz, of W.S.C. fame;
j Russ Saunders and Roy Baker,
I U.S.C. turnouts; iviayes McLain of
j Haskell and lowa fame; Gene Rose
, of Wisconsin; and Bill McKalip, star
; end for Oregon State two years ago.
Consider Outfit Tough
But this bunch, with all their ac
| cumulation of ability, will have some
i tough, tough going when they run
| up against the Carideo-coached and
j led team. Practically ail the stars
in that galaxy have played at Notre
1 Dame, and several of them in the
j same years, so they know the sys
j tem and are bound to work pretty
smoothly together.
| The famous Carideo will have
j "Red" Mackay, Purdue line coach
| and a Notre Dame man himself, to
i help him line the team up, and
| "Red" may even get in the game.
; Marty Brill, "Christy" Flanagan, and
! "Moon" Mullins are only three of
the well-remembered stars who will
i play at Kezar. The whole team will
j arrive in San Francisco Monday,
I and work out at the stadium there
I all week.
I This Knights of Columbus charity
| game will be a good test of the
i Warner and Rockne systems, and
Nevers is pretty sure of the ability
of his team, which includes practi
; cally all his Chicago Cardinals, to
j take the contest.
Food experts say a normal boy
I should eat more than his father.

Has Iligh-scorcr
Nevers has.gathered together some \
of the finest and most powerful foot
ball players in the country for this j
game. Himself playing his regular'
position at full, he will have with '
him in the backfield Malloys, from j
Loyola, Chicago, a mighty good |
quarterback, who may call tho sig- j
nals. At half he will have Johnnie ,
Blood, a high scorer in the National !
League this last season as a member
of the World's champion Green Bay
team, and Bonnie Belden, expert
blocker, who hails from Santa Rosa. ]
Other stellar players who will be
on the campus with the Nevers ag
gregation next week are Johnniel

1 Kitzmiller, former Oregon flash;
{ Elmer Schwartz, of W.S.C. fame;
j Russ Saunders and Roy Baker,
I U.S.C. turnouts; iviayes McLain of
j Haskell and lowa fame; Gene Rose
, of Wisconsin; and Bill McKalip, star
; end for Oregon State two years ago.
Consider Outfit Tough
But this bunch, with all their ac
| cumulation of ability, will have some
i tough, tough going when they run
| up against the Carideo-coached and
j led team. Practically ail the stars
in that galaxy have played at Notre
1 Dame, and several of them in the
j same years, so they know the sys
j tem and are bound to work pretty
smoothly together.
| The famous Carideo will have
j "Red" Mackay, Purdue line coach
| and a Notre Dame man himself, to
i help him line the team up, and
| "Red" may even get in the game.
; Marty Brill, "Christy" Flanagan, and
! "Moon" Mullins are only three of
the well-remembered stars who will
i play at Kezar. The whole team will
j arrive in San Francisco Monday,
I and work out at the stadium there
I all week.
I This Knights of Columbus charity
| game will be a good test of the
i Warner and Rockne systems, and
Nevers is pretty sure of the ability
of his team, which includes practi
; cally all his Chicago Cardinals, to
j take the contest.
Food experts say a normal boy
I should eat more than his father.
Post-season though it is, if the I
Stanford campus wants to take any- J
thing more than a vicarious interest
in the great Nevers-Carideo football
contest at Kezar January 24, it can.
For Ernie himself, the great Nevers
whom Pop Warner characterized as
the finest player he ever coached,
will be here on the campus all next
week, grooming his bunch of star
gridders for their clash with the |
ex-Notre Dameons.
He said yesterday in Los Angeles
(hat he accepted Warner's invitation
to use the Stanford stadium as .a
final training ground, and he expects
to arrive here with his team Monday
morning. They will practice here
until the end of the week, when j
they will go to San Francisco for'
a day or two to get used to the j
Kezar turf.
