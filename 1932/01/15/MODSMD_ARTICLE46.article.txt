### 
j With a week of light practice be-
I hind them, the varsity track men
i may get a taste of practice competi
! tion this afternoon. If the intra
mural meet is held, varsity sprints
and hurdle races will be inter
spersed with the intramural events,
although the field event men will
j be given no chance to display their
i prowess.
! If the track is at all fast, Les
j Hables, Ralph Giberson, and Ben
i Eastman should force one of their
i number to break 10 fiat by a con
: siderable margin in the 100. Hables
is slowly returning to condition,
| while Giberson better than
| he did all last season, and Eastman
! needs no introduction.
Cotto Herbert and Dean Stallings
| will run for El Toro this afternoon,
I which leaves only Jack Brugman
| and Gus Meier of the varsity hurd
| lers to race against each other. No
: 440 will be held, as Captain Alvin
| Hables is not yet in the best of
i shape and Dan Murphy is suffering
from a picturesque case of poison
• oak.
The varsity distance men will not
compete in any separate races of
their own, but three of them are
running' in the intramurals. Sam
: Eastman, Frank Fullenwider, and
Jim Ferrie are all eligible for the
meet, and if these -men decide to
run the same event, an interesting
race should result. This would be
especially true if they chose the 880
and met up with Dick Wright of
last year's varsity.
