# INTRAMURAL TRACK MEET MAY TAKE PLACE TODAY
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
Weather permitting, the long- |
withheld if not awaited intramural i
track meet will take place this af- ;
ternoon on the old oval, starting at ;
4 o'clock sharp. Since calling off any
kind of a track meet in California '
would set a bad precedent, it is |
probable that the Los Angeles j
Chamber of Commerce will see that |
the sun is shining nicely by this j
afternoon. If, however, the condition |
of the track or the temperature
make running about in shorts a
precarious business, the meet will
be called off and probably run on j
next Friday.
Intensive study last night on the j
part of the Intramural Board re- j
vealed that the rules governing j
track are not the same as those for j
the other sports, and that only block j
"S" men and '34 numeral winners i
will be ineligible for today's meet, i
In addition, the Board decided that j
this WAS the fall intramural track
meet, and that only those runners ;
who were enrolled in school and in j
a condition to compete last quarter J
may race this afternoon.
Those Eligible For Meet
Therefore, only the men who i
qualified for the sprints, the hurdles,
and the field events will be allowed j
to participate in them. The situation |
in the distance races is a bit dif- I
ferent, as anyone who is eligible for j
the meet may sign up at the post

| for the 880, the mile, or the two
l mile runs.
Since the conditions governing the
j meet arc the same as though it were
j being run on December 11, any
' runn : s who were physically in
i capacitated at that time cannot en
j ter. This rules out Biil Mearns,
I upon whom El Toro based part of
| their hopes for a victory in the
| relay, as well as Will Harwood, who
I had aspirations of garnering points
; for the Breakers in the sprints of
the 440.
Austin, Kalin Eliminated
Penny Austin, whose return to
| school caused much glee among the
j Breakers, will also watch the meet
i from the sidelines, because he was
! not registered last quarter, as will
I freshman Marvie Kahn, because of
i an injury that had him disabled at
j the time of the original meet.
All of this afternoon's events
promise to bo interesting, with the
j meeting of last year's star freshman
1 sprinter, Jimmie Willson, and this
| year's star freshman sprinter, A1
Blackmail, attracting special notice.

Weather permitting, the long- |
withheld if not awaited intramural i
track meet will take place this af- ;
ternoon on the old oval, starting at ;
4 o'clock sharp. Since calling off any
kind of a track meet in California '
would set a bad precedent, it is |
probable that the Los Angeles j
Chamber of Commerce will see that |
the sun is shining nicely by this j
afternoon. If, however, the condition |
of the track or the temperature
make running about in shorts a
precarious business, the meet will
be called off and probably run on j
next Friday.
Intensive study last night on the j
part of the Intramural Board re- j
vealed that the rules governing j
track are not the same as those for j
the other sports, and that only block j
"S" men and '34 numeral winners i
will be ineligible for today's meet, i
In addition, the Board decided that j
this WAS the fall intramural track
meet, and that only those runners ;
who were enrolled in school and in j
a condition to compete last quarter J
may race this afternoon.
Those Eligible For Meet
Therefore, only the men who i
qualified for the sprints, the hurdles,
and the field events will be allowed j
to participate in them. The situation |
in the distance races is a bit dif- I
ferent, as anyone who is eligible for j
the meet may sign up at the post

| for the 880, the mile, or the two
l mile runs.
Since the conditions governing the
j meet arc the same as though it were
j being run on December 11, any
' runn : s who were physically in
i capacitated at that time cannot en
j ter. This rules out Biil Mearns,
I upon whom El Toro based part of
| their hopes for a victory in the
| relay, as well as Will Harwood, who
I had aspirations of garnering points
; for the Breakers in the sprints of
the 440.
Austin, Kalin Eliminated
Penny Austin, whose return to
| school caused much glee among the
j Breakers, will also watch the meet
i from the sidelines, because he was
! not registered last quarter, as will
I freshman Marvie Kahn, because of
i an injury that had him disabled at
j the time of the original meet.
All of this afternoon's events
promise to bo interesting, with the
j meeting of last year's star freshman
1 sprinter, Jimmie Willson, and this
| year's star freshman sprinter, A1
Blackmail, attracting special notice.
