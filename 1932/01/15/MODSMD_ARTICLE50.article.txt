# RYAN LAB STUDIES COST OF LEAKAGE FROM POWER LINES
## Tests To Aid L.A. Find Cheapest Methods Of Carrying Power 
### 
The Ryan High Voltage Labora
tory on the campus has been help
ing the city of Los Angeles to de
termine the cheapest way of trans
mitting electric power over what
will be the longest line in the world j
for carrying power direct from
source to point of distribution. This
is the proposed line from Hoover
Dam to Los Angeles.
Graduate students in the elec- [
trical engineering department will \
continue to conduct tests in rela
tion to this problem, in addition to
a series of tests just completed. This
series, conducted by the laboratory
during the summer and fall quar- j
ters, was to determine the amount j
of power that leaks ofT high voltage
wires into the air, according to J. S. j
Carroll, associate professor of elec- '
trical engineering.
Loss Expensive
The loss of power in transmitting [
it is expensive, but so is the larger j
conducting wire which would be i
necessary to lessen the waste. The :
problem, then, is to find the exact j
amount of power lost from different 1
types of conductors, so as to tell j
which kind of conductor it will pay
to install. The Laboratory experts i
made these measurements by means ,
of three high-voltage watt-meters, j
the oldest of them having been de- j
signed by Dr. Ryan and used in |
3922. The others are improvements i
on this one, made at the Laboratory j
later.
How atmospheric conditions, such j
as temperature, affect the loss of j
power from conducting wires, is an- j
other problem which the electrical j
engineering students will tackle this j
quarter. Also, one will study the |
effect of the conductor's surface, j
whether clean, greasy, or oxidized, j
upon the loss in power transmission.
Loss Over Insulators
Another will try to measure the j
loss over insulators, which while j
only about 25 per cent of the-total I
loss, will prove quite expensive on
a system like that of Los Angeles,
where so many insulators willl have
to be used and 250,000 kilowatts
will be transmitted.
The longest lines now in use carry
power 200 miles, while the one from
Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, Nevada, !
to Los Angeles, will be 300 miles.

The longest lines now in use carry
power 200 miles, while the one from
Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, Nevada, !
to Los Angeles, will be 300 miles.
The Ryan High Voltage Labora
tory on the campus has been help
ing the city of Los Angeles to de
termine the cheapest way of trans
mitting electric power over what
will be the longest line in the world j
for carrying power direct from
source to point of distribution. This
is the proposed line from Hoover
Dam to Los Angeles.
Graduate students in the elec- [
trical engineering department will \
continue to conduct tests in rela
tion to this problem, in addition to
a series of tests just completed. This
series, conducted by the laboratory
during the summer and fall quar- j
ters, was to determine the amount j
of power that leaks ofT high voltage
wires into the air, according to J. S. j
Carroll, associate professor of elec- '
trical engineering.
Loss Expensive
The loss of power in transmitting [
it is expensive, but so is the larger j
conducting wire which would be i
necessary to lessen the waste. The :
problem, then, is to find the exact j
amount of power lost from different 1
types of conductors, so as to tell j
which kind of conductor it will pay
to install. The Laboratory experts i
made these measurements by means ,
of three high-voltage watt-meters, j
the oldest of them having been de- j
signed by Dr. Ryan and used in |
3922. The others are improvements i
on this one, made at the Laboratory j
later.
How atmospheric conditions, such j
as temperature, affect the loss of j
power from conducting wires, is an- j
other problem which the electrical j
engineering students will tackle this j
quarter. Also, one will study the |
effect of the conductor's surface, j
whether clean, greasy, or oxidized, j
upon the loss in power transmission.
Loss Over Insulators
Another will try to measure the j
loss over insulators, which while j
only about 25 per cent of the-total I
loss, will prove quite expensive on
a system like that of Los Angeles,
where so many insulators willl have
to be used and 250,000 kilowatts
will be transmitted.
