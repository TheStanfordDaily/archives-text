# INGENIOUS ANTIQUE SETTINGS FINISHED ON "BIRD IN HAND"
## Rehearsals Get Under Way, Presentation Is Set For January 29 
### Harrison Foss 
All the actual construction work
for "Bird In Hand" lias been com
pleted.
Frederick Stover, who has been
in charge of production at Stanford
for the last three years, has already
met the problems offered by John
Drinkwater's comedy, "Bird In
Hand."
The setting of the play is de
scribed as an ancient hostelry in
which generations of the Greenleaf
family have lived for three hundred
years as owners and proprietors.
The interiors of the old inn revealed
during the unfolding of the play
are the Greenleafs' living room ad
joining the bar and parlors, and a
bedroom upstairs under the slop
ing roof.
The first of these, the living room,
must Ix 3 a setting depicting not only
middleclass comfort and rural do
mesticity, but, above all, age. The
very mildew of centuries has cre
ated a mellow haze over the origi
nal interior, converting it from an
uninteresting ertscmble of provin
cial and utilitarian fixtures into a
room of distinct personality'. Deeply
recessed casements and an ample
hooded fireplace will make this
room much more than a mere
background.
The second act is set in the bed
room upstairs. This room has less
charm but otherwise there is no
difference for it is part of the same
old structure. The sloping roof line
will be revealed by the shape of
the walls and the old doors will
suggest peasant's cottage doors
rarely found anywhex-e except in
the small houses which dot the
countryside of Britain.
The limitations of the Assembly
Hall stage offer the problem of ar
ranging for quick scenei'y shifts.
Stover plans to overcome this by
placing the fireplace of the first act
on rollers which slide back, giving
ample room for the fiats used in
the second act to be brought in and
set up in front of the first act
scenery.
In che third act the scene returns
to the living room of the first act.
"Bird In Hand" is now in re
hearsal under the direction of
Hai'old Helvenston, and will be pro
duced on January 29.

for the last three years, has already
met the problems offered by John
Drinkwater's comedy, "Bird In
Hand."
The setting of the play is de
scribed as an ancient hostelry in
which generations of the Greenleaf
family have lived for three hundred
years as owners and proprietors.
The interiors of the old inn revealed
during the unfolding of the play
are the Greenleafs' living room ad
joining the bar and parlors, and a
bedroom upstairs under the slop
ing roof.
The first of these, the living room,
must Ix 3 a setting depicting not only
middleclass comfort and rural do
mesticity, but, above all, age. The
very mildew of centuries has cre
ated a mellow haze over the origi
nal interior, converting it from an
uninteresting ertscmble of provin
cial and utilitarian fixtures into a
room of distinct personality'. Deeply
recessed casements and an ample
hooded fireplace will make this
room much more than a mere
background.
The second act is set in the bed
room upstairs. This room has less
charm but otherwise there is no
difference for it is part of the same
old structure. The sloping roof line
will be revealed by the shape of
the walls and the old doors will
suggest peasant's cottage doors
rarely found anywhex-e except in
the small houses which dot the
countryside of Britain.
The limitations of the Assembly
Hall stage offer the problem of ar
ranging for quick scenei'y shifts.
Stover plans to overcome this by
placing the fireplace of the first act
on rollers which slide back, giving
ample room for the fiats used in
the second act to be brought in and
set up in front of the first act
scenery.
In che third act the scene returns
to the living room of the first act.
"Bird In Hand" is now in re
hearsal under the direction of
Hai'old Helvenston, and will be pro
duced on January 29.
