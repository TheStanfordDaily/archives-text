# GOLF TOURNAMENT PLANS ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
Plans for an all-University no
vice tournament were announced
yesterday by E. M. Twiggs, club
I pro.
The competition, which will begin
within the next two weeks, will be
open to only those players who
have never been fortunate enough
to garner a trophy of any sort be
fore. Thrown open to the whole
University, Twiggs believes that the
i tournament may turn up some first
class material that otherwise would
i be frightened out by stiffer compe
i tition.
