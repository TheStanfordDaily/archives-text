# GERMAN PROFESSOR DISCUSSES HISTORY OF HUMAN DISEASE
## 
### 
With the exposition of the intri
cate relations existing between a
culture of a certain time and the
contemporary diseases, Dr. Henry
E. Sigerist, professor of medical his
tory at the University of Leipzig,
last night addressed an audience of
approximately 100 persons in the
Little Theatre.

That disease is as old as life it
self was pointed out by Dr. Sigerist.
Inspection of Egyptian mummies has
shown that tuberculosis existed in
Egypt as early as 2000 B.C. Geolo
gists have proved that bacteria date
back prior to the pre-Cambrian era.

Concerning the increase of nerv
ous disorders during the 19th and
20th centuries, Dr. Sigerist said,

"Man has a natural speed of three
miles an hour, but modern inven
tions carry him at a much faster
rate. Whether or not he will be able
to stand the increasing strain on his
nervous system is doubtful."
