# S.C. DEBATE TO BE 'NO DECISION'
## Arrangements Made For Two Encounters 
### 
Following the customary proce
' dure of Pacific Coast Conference
j schools, the dual debate between
i Stanford and the University of
j Southern California, to be held
February 11, will be a no-decision
contest.
In a communication with John
; Gange, Stanford debate manager,
j the debating manager of U.S.C.
agreed to the arrangements being
made for the two verbal encountei's,
one to be held at Stanford between
the local affirmatives and the South
ern negative team and the other
contest in Los Angeles, to which
i the Stanford team will travel.
The question selected for the de-
I bate is the one suggested by Pi
! Kappa Delta, national honorary de
' bating fraternity, and reads, "Re
| solved. That Congress should pass
j legislation providing for the cen
| tralized control of industry." The
j special significance of this economic
| discussion is due t othe attempts of
; the present session of Congress to
solve the economic problems of the
; United States through political in
| terference. In the actual interpreta
| tion of the debate question, how-
I ever, no particular plan is involved;
j merely the establishment of the
I principle is aimed at.
Leland Chapin, assistant debate
j coach, has announced that positions
' of Ihe teams for the U.S.C. debate
I will be open to all squad members.
| Since the squad has 35 men work
! ing on the question, competition will
I be keen for the teams which John
i G. Emerson, head debate coach, will
! select.
According to reports from the
South, Coach Nichols, of U.S.C., has
j a large crop of experienced de
baters, so the debate with Stanford
is expected to be a closely con
tested affair.
