### 
'WASHINGTON, Jan. 17. (/!>> —Congress will get the first two and most
important pieces of the emergency economic relief measures to Presi- :
dent Hoover this week. Millions for the Nation's financial institutions and 1
agriculture will he pouring out of the Treasury before next Sunday for
assistance which Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have joined
in enacting to speed better limes. Conferences will be begun tomorrow !
to adjust differences between the Senate and House on the bills authoriz- |
ing the $2,000,000,000 Reconstruction Finance Corporation and recapitaliza- :
lion of the Federal land banks.

" Ready For Operation
I President Hoover is ready to put j
each into immediate operation. He j
lis seriously considering Eugene (
! Meyer, governor of the Federal Re- 1
I serve Board and veteran relief ad- |
i ministrator, to direct the gigantic i
| Reconstruction Corporation. Ber- 1
! nard M. Baruch of New York is re- !
! garded as a certain Democratic'
j member of the? corporation and |
i possible chairman.
| The economic-minded Congress!
| which has kept steadily to the task '
| so far of seeking to improve the l
, national business and agricultural }
! situation will go right ahead on the l
■ emergency legislative program, but
some difficulty confronts other pro- j
posals advanced by Mr. Hoover.
Hearings to Continue
Hearings will be resumed in both ]
the Senate and House this week on
the measures to establish a home ,
loan banking system and to create a
government corporation for the re- |
lief of closed bank depositors. A lot |
of discussion is ahead on each.
Meanwhile, the House will have .
I opportunity to test out its promised j
j economy plans on the first of the j
I regular appropriation bills. The ,
; measure supplying funds for next i
year's operation of the Agriculture i
Department is about ready to be re
ported from committee.
How Impending
A row is impending on the LaFol
lettc-Costigan measure in the Sen
i ate to appropriate $375,000,000 for
[ direct unemployement aid — a step
| firmly opposed by the President.
This measure in all probability will
reach the Senate floor in the next
six days.
The vital tax increase legislation
will not get to the House until Feb
ruary 1, and plenty of dispute is i
ahead on this controversial lcgisla- !
tion.
All in all, Congress is going to j
keep right on the stupendous cco- I
nomic avenue.
