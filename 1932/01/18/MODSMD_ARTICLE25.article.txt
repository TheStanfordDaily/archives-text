### 
WINSLOW, Ariz., Jan. 17. (/?*> â€” i
Six army bombing airplanes from j
March Field, Calif., took the air at i
8:30 a.m. today in a mission of i
mercy to snowbound and suffering j
Navajo Indians of this district.
By noon 10,800 pounds of rations >
had been dropped at widely sepa- j
rated points and the work is con- j
tinuing.
The hungry and shivering red
men rushed eagerly to Ihe spot the I
instant the bundles of provisions'
struck the snow-covered earth.
Bundles Torn Open
The parcels were torn open with }
ravenous haste and their contents !
distributed among the tribesmen. I
Officials said at noon that the de- j
livery of supplies would be slower ;
henceforth as the more remote set- ,
tlements are reached.
Today's actual delivery of food
followed survey flights yesterday in |
which "distress points" were desig- I
nated ever the reservation and ex- !
periments were conducted in drop
ping food. j
Heavy Cover Needed
It. soon becan\e plain that the j
bundles must be wrapped in rpany j
thicknesses of heavy paper and bur- I
lap. Beans and other loose articles |
were scattered over 1000 square feet
of snow when an ordinary cloth i
sack was used on the first test flight, j
Each plane is carrying 900 pounds !
of food divided into ten bundles of j
equal weight, the packages contain- i
ing beans, flour, sugar, salt pork, '
and dried fruit.
