# TROJANS TAKE DOUBLE WIN IN HOT CONTESTS
## Cards Drop First Scrap At 35-28, Second Goes To Overtime, 28-24 U.S.C. LEADS DIVISION Cordry Stars In First Tilt, Out Of Saturday's 
### Lowell Cox 
After being taken far a "ride" Fri
day nighl, Stanford's basketball
quintet came back to fight South
ern California's rough-house Tro
jans to a standstill on Saturday, only
to lose a heart-breaking 28 to 24
decision in an extx-a period of play.
Friday's game, one of the roughest
ever seen at the Pavilion, went to
the Trojans by a 35 to 28 score.
While the officials allowed the tor
rid affair to got completely out of
control, the southerners went, on a
scoring spree early in the game and
maintained a safe lead throughout.
After their early 5 to 2 lead was
wiped out by the deadly work of
Jerry Nemer, the Indians never had
a chance. The half ended with I lie
score 21 to 0, and while Stanford
outscored the visitors in the second
half, it was a futile effort.
Changes Lineup
Far different was the Saturday
contest. Coach John Bunn started
an entirely changed lineup, with
Meade and LaCombe, forwards,
Hancock, center, and Norgard and
Edelen, guards. From the time thai
Norgard tanked the first basket of
the game, the Indians matched the
Trojans for speed and cleverness,
and it was not untii the closing min
utes of the half that two free throws
gave the southerners n 12 to 10 lead.
The second half saw big John
Hancock go berserk, with a result
that Stanford led, 22 to 17, half way
through the period. Three foul shots
and two beautiful field goals by
Pierce put the Trojans into a 24 to
23 lead, however, with only two and
one-half minutes to play.
Stanford Falters
Fearing the notorious U.S.C. stall
ing tactics, Bunn sent in Jenkins to
get the tip-off, which lie did. Ede
len was fouled, but missed the shot
awarded him, as did Rintala soon
after, and Stanford's last hope
seemed gone. With only seconds to
go, LaCombe was given a free
throw, and while the 3000 jammed
in the Pavilion held their breaths,
he calmly dropped the ball through
the hoop to tie the score at. 24 to 21
just before the gun sounded.
Two perfect plays in the extra
period decided the issue. Gardner
stole into the hole for one field goal
in the first minute, while the poison
ous Nemer eluded Hancock for an
other in the last. The Indians twice
worked men into the hole for shots,
but on both occasions the ball rolled
off the hoop.
A foul shooting slump really
cost (he Stanford live the second
game, just as ability in that de
partment won both tilts over
I .C.L.A. the week before. While
collecting nine points by that
route, tlie Indians rould have
grabbed the contest by sinking
just one more of eight other
tries.

C.S.C. Pounds Conlr>

"Tiny Tom" Cordry got up fit>m
a hospital bed to play pari of Fri
day's game, but handicapped by a
cracked leg, he was obviously not
himself. Coach Bunn decided not '*Â»
use him Saturday, saving the dimin
utive star for the California game
next Friday rather than run the
ri.sk of having him banged up
by the Trojans, who continually
roughed him.
