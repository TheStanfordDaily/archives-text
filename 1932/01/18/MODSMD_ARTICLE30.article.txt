•s |»orIsi11;t11 si i i |) (if il can be called flfat) of Ihc Stanford
rooting section combined lo make the week-end basket
ball affray wilh Southern (California one of (lie sorriest
exhibitions this campus has ever witnessed. A great many
incompetent, prejudiced referees have appeared in the
Pavilion, Jail the work of a gentleman named William
Dunn eclipsed anything the aforesaid incompetents ever
perpetrated. Stanford's rooting section is ordinarily no
worwe than those of other schools, but its altitude of Friday
and Saturday nights was about as rotten as could he imag
ined.
A handful of hot-blooded Bedshirl adherents started
Ihc fireworks by hooting the Trojans the moment they ap
peared on the floor Friday night, certainly a cheap stunt.
But booing is contagious, and when the Pavilion crowd got
its tirst look at Dunn's work, if simply went mad, and
stayed that way through both games. The writer, knowing
that he. would comment to this effect in the Daily, kept
reasonably calm on Friday night, but succumbed to Dunn's
first half performance the following evening and screamed
:ii him continually thereafter.
Nevertheless, il is self-evident that booing doesn't do
any good. It can't change the referees' decisions, no matter
how raw they seem; if doesn't help the players, and it
stamps the Stanford spirit of which we are so proud as
something rather shoddy. Those are (Coach John Bunn's
feelings in the matter, and Hie rooters would do well to
heed them.
So much for the rooting section. The writer thought Ned
Kay did a very fair job under the circumstances and de
served commending for gamely returning to the court Sat
urday night after turning his ankle. As for Dunn—well,
during the Iwo games, he called six fouls on the Trojans
and 20 on the Indians. He. called 'Frenchy Laconibe for
walking half a dozen limes and calmly watched Jerry
Nemer stride all over the place. He stood under the basket,
watched Bill Pierce throw himself into Johnny Hancock,
and then called a foul on the. latter. lie stood right next to
(Jiff Capps as the Infler shoved Stanford forwards and
never said a word. Not iiial the Indians were lily-whites—
but Dunn called— I hose. We could go on in this vein for
some time, but what good would il do?
Incidentally, Sam Barry of the Trojans could pick up a
few points on conduct for coaches from John Bunn. Barry
was up and down like an elevator every moment of the two
games, grimacing and gesticulating like a ham actor every
time the whistle sounded. Bunn sal silently on the bench
all the while, never making a move, even when his team
was the victim of some of Hie rawest decisions imaginable.
