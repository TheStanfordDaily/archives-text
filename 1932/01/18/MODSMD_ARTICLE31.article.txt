Walter Lippman, noted journalist and author, in a re
cent interview for an Eastei i university newspaper con
demns universities and not the press for overemphasis of
athletics.
"You can't Maine newspapers for the overemphasis,"
he staled. "The blame is on the. universities. The news
paper reflects and exaggerates the overemphasis. The
cause and cure lie wholly within the walls of the university.
When universities decide to reduce the. emphasis they can
do it. It's no use passing the huck.
"The older universities will have to set Ihe example.
The bad effects of this overemphasis are very widespread.
A university should set standards for national life. The
spectacle of universities commercializing themselves and
going in for ballyhoo has had a bad effect upon students,
alumni and the general public because il sanctions, with
the prestige of the university's name, aspects of American
life which are extremely undesirable."
In reversing cause and effect Lippmann is placing the
cart before the horse. I 'Diversities have not deliberallv
fostered and built up I his emphasis in athletics. Jl is public
demand and interest, supported and propagandized bv
newspapers, that have forced universities into the situation
Iha I they now occupy.
As for commercialization, it is sillv and inane to con
demn universities because football receipts have swelled to
such large amounts. Football supports all other athletics
and many university projects besides. Colleges would be
foolish not to jump at the advantages that football, because
of public interest, has to offer.
Also it might be noted that Lippmann mentions the
bad effects of overemphasis bill fails to point out what they
are. Why should universities pass up a gold mine, for
money is useful even at educational institutions, because
of mythical, idealistic disadvantages?
