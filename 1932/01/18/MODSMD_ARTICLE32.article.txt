# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
The chorus that would answer,
"What's the matter with basketball,"
with "It's nil right" would probably
be a solo, or more probably, just a
reflection upon the part of every
body that silence is golden. Prob
ably no sport endures the bitter
criticism that is always the lot of
basketball. Not only this season but
many seasons. Every sport dislikes
football, which has captured the
heart, the mind, and the pocketbook
of the student and the general pub
lic. Basektball enthusiasts especially
are piqued that football should so
outstrip the hoop game. But there's
a reason! —Yes, several reasons.
T don't know who runs basketball.
It must have some boss—everything
does. There must be somebody or
somebodies who change rules, hire
referees, and all that sort of thing.
Now, what they plan to do has not
been made public; but if the Bull
Session were crowned Casaba King,
several things would happen imme
diately.
Referees would be chosen for per
sonality as well of the
game. Anybody can learn some
rules and blow a whistle. That's
comparatively easy. But to referee
a game successfully takes a man
who is simply top-heavy with "it."
That's what puts Dana over. He has
the ability to penalize arid make
both teams like it. When that big
blond giant strides down the floor
he can command something besides

| boos and catcalls. Tall, gray-haired
umpires who are partly bald and
I whose names begin with "D" would
j never get jobs.
A second Royal Order would
i penalize stalling. This dulls the game
I and causes bad feeling among those
j that have paid to see a sporting
j contest and are forced to witness
two men play a very thrilling game
j of standing still and glaring at the
opposition.
\ .
The third Imperial Mandate would
| be very harsh on coaches that talked
from the benches. Just as football
I coaches are forced to bite their
j linger nails or puff extra hard when
i dumb quarterbacks call line bucks
! instead of end runs, so would bas
| ketball mentors be made to count
| rafters or chew gum to relieve their
j pent-up emotions. Suppression may
j be an undesirable thing but coaches
j should either suppress or suffer
I penalties.
j These Ihen are at least three
(things that basketball must do if il
j is not to linger for a few years and
i (hen suffer a living death like soc
j cer or model "T" Fords. Some peo-.
i pie may be relieved to see this sport
go the way of all ex-Presidents.
Personally, we would regret im-
J mensely to see basketball die an
; ignominious death amidst the jeer
i ing boos of outraged audiences. For
j one thing, it would rob the barbers
j of their one topic of conversation
after football ends and before track
1 begins. —Abe Mellinkoff

The chorus that would answer,
"What's the matter with basketball,"
with "It's nil right" would probably
be a solo, or more probably, just a
reflection upon the part of every
body that silence is golden. Prob
ably no sport endures the bitter
criticism that is always the lot of
basketball. Not only this season but
many seasons. Every sport dislikes
football, which has captured the
heart, the mind, and the pocketbook
of the student and the general pub
lic. Basektball enthusiasts especially
are piqued that football should so
outstrip the hoop game. But there's
a reason! —Yes, several reasons.

It must have some boss—everything

referees, and all that sort of thing.
Now, what they plan to do has not

Session were crowned Casaba King,
several things would happen imme

Referees would be chosen for per
sonality as well of the
game. Anybody can learn some
rules and blow a whistle. That's
comparatively easy. But to referee
a game successfully takes a man
who is simply top-heavy with "it."
