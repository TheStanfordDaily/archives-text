WEST OF BROADWAY—At (lie
New Stanford Theatre.
This particular event ;it the Stan
ford is a fortunate one, including as
it does, good shorts and a good fea
ture.
John Gilbert as the millionaire,
who, jilted by one girl carries out a
gin marriage with another girl not.
so socially desirable, manages to be
unconvincingly convincing. Lois
Moran as the girl he marries is
really good and makes the other
feminine characters in the play look
awfully weak. El Brendel and a
Chinese cook provide the humor
which is real humor and not over
done. The plot is better than the
average and even the horses are
good actors, which is more than
can be said for the rest of the cast
apart from those mentioned.
That husky Swede, Karl Dane,
with his plug of tobacco and his
little pal, Arthur, with his cockney

' accent, produce n good deal of fun
I and a great deal of destruction in
the erection of a ready-made house, j
, This one includes a fine bathroom
scene. A diving picture which is
both interesting and funny and a j
: sort of saxaphone "symphunny"
; complete the bill. —S.C.A.
FRIENDS AND LOVERS—At the I
Varsity Theatre.
Adolpho Menjou as the principal j
lin this greatly overdrawn melo- j
drania does a very mediocre bit of \
\ acting. The suave, polished Adolphe j
( was cut out for a man-about-town, ;
; or a head-waiter; certainly not a
| brusque army officer in the Foreign
Legion.
There was altogether too little of
Erich von Stroheim. Even the few
scenes there were of this very dis- ;
tinguished actor were enough to :
save the show from being a com- j
| plete collapse. —B. M.
