What an inspiring tropical garden |
is this our campus Paradise (ac- j
cording to the S.P. catalogue—Red j
tiled rooms gleaming with icicles, j
and a group of buildings modelled j
after the true Spanish in architec- j
I ture, in this low, warm, fertile val- ;
! ley—with a background of hills 1
I white with snov/, blah, blah -yes, j
and corpses of frozen students all i
over the Quad, a chilblain per
square foot, woolen underwear at a
! premium in the Paly stores, and j
| even the Phi Betes getting left out j
in the cold. (A pun, Archie, a pun, j
j by gar!)

Everything has its sunny side,
i though, we understand, and
gasoline is going up —
'way up with the carefree youths
and maidens, tra la, who have
taken to seminaring up on King's
I Mountain, like our fathers used i
to do in the long, hard winters
of '00 and oh! ol>!
And the Kappa Sigs are blessing \
I the snow, for as long as it lasts they |
I don't have to worry (much) about, j
j baseball practice. The dear little
; things bring the nice, cold, white j
j stuff down to their lawn, and prac- j
| tice pitching it at all and sundry i
' passersby the sweet, innocent j
I lambs!
Perhaps this is the appropriate
time to hritlg in our story of
(he dear little sophomore in an
' American History class, last
quarter, who faithfully recorded
in her final that "in the middle
of the nineteenth century ail
j the morons moved to Utah."
What we wonder is when they
started moving west, again .... ]
You'd be surprised, we're sure, to f
i learn of all the members of this!
; Five Hundred of ours, who sudden
i ly today will become members of J
i the oldest and most important fami- j
j lies in the country; are intimate j
| friends of the Hoovers, of the royal j
family of England, and practically!
j anybody else you happen to men
| tion; are engaged to the captain of j
j the Yale football team; are candi- j
j dates for Phi Bete and still have

time to be the most popular girl
on campus; etc., etc., tic. is
with us still, yet, again, already,
now.
We wonder just what the
KAT\s thought about the quad
ruped attached to their front
lawn the other morning? Did
they take it to mean "Neigh,
neigh"? Did it refer to the speed
with which they get around?
(gulp). Or does one simply un
derstand it to mean "Aw, go
hire a hearse!" Yes, we wonder
—but not too hard ....
