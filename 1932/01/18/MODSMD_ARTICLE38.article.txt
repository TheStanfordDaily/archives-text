BASKETBALL?
The roughest "basketball" team
<o invade the Pavilion in many a
long day has gone back to the Uni
versity of Southern California cam
pus after kneeing, tripping, holding,
'.hovir.g, charging, and blocking its
ay through two games with Stan
>urd.
Not (hat such tactics were
necessary. r I lie Trojans had a
team (hat was capable of light
ning-fast play, that could de
liver in the pinches. Far super
ior to the Indian five on Friday
night, the Southerners demon
strated their strength on Satur
day in turning hack a great
Stanford bid for victory.
Comment by a college writer af
ter such a series usually is dis
rounJcd because of the alibi element
ordinarily construed to be involved.
We are not presenting an alibi. We
ion ly wonder why a team as good
,in Southern California's thinks it
has to pull such stuff in order to
win.
It is true that the Indians were
goaded into rough tactics on Friday
night, but they could not perpetrate
J'ouls with the finesse shown by the
invaders. If the U.S.C. coaching sUiff
doe.-: not actually teach such tactics,
I at least tolerates them.
Consider the case of Pierce,
renter, for example. He appar
ently did not make a SINGLE
legal jump in either game. He
kneed, he held, and he jumped
into his opponents. Ask any
Stanford man who played op
posite him. But he did it with
such cleverness that the offi
cials seldom penalized him.
The others were no better, with
the possible exception of Nemer,
whose flagrant fouls were not nu
merous. Erskine, 210-pound football
star, used his weight to advantage
(.a "held ball" tip-offs. Capps sev
eral times roughed Cordry, who
played part of Friday night's game
in spite of a cracked leg, and con
tinually held LaCombe with 4>ne
hand while dribbling with the other.
We could fill up this column with
a list of deliberate but clever fouls
committed by each Trojan who en
tered the game.
Sportsmanship might have been,
r ii antiquated code for old women's
( roquet games, as far as the South
( ri'ers were concerned. Whenever a
Stanford man touched one of them,
he tumbled to the floor, shouting at
ihe referee that he had been fouled,
like a prize-fighter taking a "dive."
The officials? Ned Kay did every
thing in his power to keep the situ
ation in control. Friday night's af
fair got away from him, bui he de
■rves a hand for the way he han
dled the Saturday contest.
As for one Mr. Dunn, the less said
the batter. The strain must have
been too much for him.
Just a word about "that stalling
jme of "Silent Sam" Barry's. All
v.'lio saw it hold up Saturday night's
1 /loy for four minutes must realize
that it: is doing great harm to bas
ketball.
Based <m the idea of "to the
devil with the spectators," it is
distinctly against the policy of
the National Association of Bas
ketball Coaches. Fans support
basketball because it is based
on speed. When a team such as
Southern California's, which is
capable of great speed, deliber
ately holds up play when it gets
in the lead, it is bound to do
irreparable harm to the game.
Legislation by the rules commit
t<o is necessary to check this evil.
Allowed to continue, it could stran
j*:i * the game to death. —L.M.C.
