# Babe Cagers Take Stockton, Lose to Moragans
## LAST-MINUTE DRIVE NETS SINGLE-POINT WIN OVER TARZANS St. Mary's Runs Up 35-22 Count; Lawry Rothert High-Point Man 
### Albert Guerard 
A Tom Rover novel finish brought
! tht Stanford freshmen their first
victory of the' season Saturday night,
: when Charles Coiner, diminutive
1 Indian forward, dribbled down court
I and netted a close-in shot, his first
I basket of the season, to give the
; yearlings a 22-21 victory over the
, highly touted Stockton High Tar
j zans, while the timer's watch ticked
I off the last fifteen seconds of the
i game. On Friday night the fresh
! men were beaten by a very smooth
working St. Mary's five, 35-22, after
I holding the Moragans to a 17-14
score at half time.
The improved showing of the
j freshmen was chiefly due to the
I sudden acquisition of good shooting
i eyes on the part of Forwards Frank
i Cox, Charles Coiner, and Lawry
j Rothert.
Rothert Shines
Rothert is a new addition to the
squad, but brilliant shooting and a
finished floor game definitely estab
| lished him as a permanent fixture
in Vance Fawcett's yearling ma
i chine. Rothert was Stanford's high
! point man in both Friday's and
| Saturday's tussles with eight and
five points, respectively.
The Stockton game started badly,
; and the Tarzans grabbed a 17-8 lead
lat half-time. In the third period
j Tom Kelly replaced "Dud" Sales at
j center, and showed the best center
! play of the freshman season. Aided
| by Rolhert, Kelly was largely re
j sponsible for Stanford's outscoring
! the Tarzans 11-2 in the third quar
ter, and netting the score 19-9 at
the beginning of the final period. In
i the last ten minutes of the game
I the Papooses easily outplayed the
prepsters but a field goal by Alders,.
Tarzan center, enabled the Stockton
five to hold a 21-20 lead until
Coiner's beautiful shot brought vic
tory to the Indians with "moments |
to spare."
Great Improvement
Three clean baskets by Rothert
in the first half of the St. Mary's
game brought hope to supporters I
of the Class of '35, and the baby
Gaels were held to a 17-14 advan
tage at the intermission. A pair of
forwards, Mora ana Billy Meade,
brother of Reggie Meade of varsity
fame, got "hot" in the third period
and dropped seven field goals in a
row before Rothert broke the ice
with a nice shot from near the foul
line. "Soapy" Johnson, former Bur
lingamo High star, gave a brilliant
exhibition of guard play for the
Moragans.
Both in teamwork and individual
play, the Babes have shown aston
] ishing improvement over their
I sloppy showings in the Pittsburg
and Palo Alto High games. At that
time Stanford supporters were ready
to give up the ship as a total loss,
but the week-end games indicate
that Fawcett's team is ready for a
successful season, with a California
series victory far from the impos
sibility it seemed to be this time
last week.

A Tom Rover novel finish brought
! tht Stanford freshmen their first
victory of the' season Saturday night,
: when Charles Coiner, diminutive
1 Indian forward, dribbled down court
I and netted a close-in shot, his first
I basket of the season, to give the
; yearlings a 22-21 victory over the
, highly touted Stockton High Tar
j zans, while the timer's watch ticked
I off the last fifteen seconds of the
i game. On Friday night the fresh
! men were beaten by a very smooth
working St. Mary's five, 35-22, after
I holding the Moragans to a 17-14
score at half time.
The improved showing of the
j freshmen was chiefly due to the
I sudden acquisition of good shooting
i eyes on the part of Forwards Frank
i Cox, Charles Coiner, and Lawry
j Rothert.
Rothert Shines
Rothert is a new addition to the
squad, but brilliant shooting and a
finished floor game definitely estab
| lished him as a permanent fixture
in Vance Fawcett's yearling ma
i chine. Rothert was Stanford's high
! point man in both Friday's and
| Saturday's tussles with eight and
five points, respectively.
The Stockton game started badly,
; and the Tarzans grabbed a 17-8 lead
lat half-time. In the third period
j Tom Kelly replaced "Dud" Sales at
j center, and showed the best center
! play of the freshman season. Aided
| by Rolhert, Kelly was largely re
j sponsible for Stanford's outscoring
! the Tarzans 11-2 in the third quar
ter, and netting the score 19-9 at
the beginning of the final period. In
i the last ten minutes of the game
I the Papooses easily outplayed the
prepsters but a field goal by Alders,.
Tarzan center, enabled the Stockton
five to hold a 21-20 lead until
Coiner's beautiful shot brought vic
tory to the Indians with "moments |
to spare."
Great Improvement
Three clean baskets by Rothert
in the first half of the St. Mary's
game brought hope to supporters I
of the Class of '35, and the baby
Gaels were held to a 17-14 advan
tage at the intermission. A pair of
forwards, Mora ana Billy Meade,
brother of Reggie Meade of varsity
fame, got "hot" in the third period
and dropped seven field goals in a
row before Rothert broke the ice
with a nice shot from near the foul
line. "Soapy" Johnson, former Bur
lingamo High star, gave a brilliant
exhibition of guard play for the
Moragans.
Both in teamwork and individual
play, the Babes have shown aston
] ishing improvement over their
I sloppy showings in the Pittsburg
and Palo Alto High games. At that
time Stanford supporters were ready
to give up the ship as a total loss,
but the week-end games indicate
that Fawcett's team is ready for a
successful season, with a California
series victory far from the impos
sibility it seemed to be this time
last week.
