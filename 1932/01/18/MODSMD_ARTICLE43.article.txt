# CARD TRACK TEAM TO START INTENSIVE GRIND AFTER "LIGHT" WORKOUT PERIOD
## 
### 
Two more weeks of supposedly
"light" workouts, and then Stan
ford's track team hits the intensive
training grind that may carry it to
a national championship. Yet these
two weeks, which would reduce the i
average human being to a mere •
mass of senseless blubber and j
which, comparatively speaking, are |
easy for the tracksters, are all-im- !
portant. They serve to keep the I
sprinters in shape, to build up the \
distance men, and to give the hur- j
dlers, jumpers, and field event men j
a chance to work on the details of
correct form.
Starting in February, the boys |
really begin work, and at that time j
they will probably look back long- 1
ingly to the days when they only |
had to run five 220's or an equal |
number of miles of cross-country j
every afternoon. That's the time of j
the year when Dink Templeton, if ]
he's not sick, sometimes bellows out
to a poor distance man who has just
puffed his way around the track
tight times: "All right, Zilch, you'd
better run a time trial in the mile." j
With a chance that the first meet
will be held as early as March 5,
the necessity of a well donditioned
track team is obvious. In order to
give the men a chance to display j
what they can and can't do, Coach '
Ellington is going to hold a practice '

meet this Friday. The meets will j
then be continued weekly until the j
start of the regular season.
Although the Stanford track |
schedule has not. been announced, J
j it is probable that the team will as
I usual meet the Olympic Club and j
J the Los Angeles A.C. The Big Meet
I and the U.S.C. meet are of course i
! both fixtures. Stanford will prob- i
i ably enter a team in the Pacific
, Coast' Intercollegiates on May 21,
I and may compete in the West Coast
| Relays at Fresno on May 14.
The Big Meet, which California
! announces will be held on April 23,
| takes place at Berkeley, while the
; Indians will attack the Trojan j
! stronghold down South, perhaps at
j Occidental. The Washington meet
j has been called because Jimmy
I Phelan's Husky football team
I couldn't make enough money to
| support the track squad.
Just as it seemed that all the In- j
dian track men had recovered from j
their various injuries, Cotto Herbert
decided he needed some publicity
j and so got hurt in an automobile
accident. Cotto had the welfare of j
the track team at heart, however,
and he will probably be able to run
in a couple of days. Which is good
j news' to El Toro's intramural j
' chances and better news to tiic var- ,
I sity hurdle prospects.

Two more weeks of supposedly
"light" workouts, and then Stan
ford's track team hits the intensive
training grind that may carry it to
a national championship. Yet these
two weeks, which would reduce the i
average human being to a mere •
mass of senseless blubber and j
which, comparatively speaking, are |
easy for the tracksters, are all-im- !
portant. They serve to keep the I
sprinters in shape, to build up the \
distance men, and to give the hur- j
dlers, jumpers, and field event men j
a chance to work on the details of
correct form.
Starting in February, the boys |
really begin work, and at that time j
they will probably look back long- 1
ingly to the days when they only |
had to run five 220's or an equal |
number of miles of cross-country j
every afternoon. That's the time of j
the year when Dink Templeton, if ]
he's not sick, sometimes bellows out
to a poor distance man who has just
puffed his way around the track
tight times: "All right, Zilch, you'd
better run a time trial in the mile." j
With a chance that the first meet
will be held as early as March 5,
the necessity of a well donditioned
track team is obvious. In order to
give the men a chance to display j
what they can and can't do, Coach '
Ellington is going to hold a practice '

meet this Friday. The meets will j
then be continued weekly until the j
start of the regular season.

i ably enter a team in the Pacific

Just as it seemed that all the In- j
dian track men had recovered from j
their various injuries, Cotto Herbert
