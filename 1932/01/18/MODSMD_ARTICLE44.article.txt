Those two preliminary contests

and another to determine third
i piace, as well as some exhibition
diving by Bill Campbell and Bob
Wardwell, may be witnessed for ten
i cents and a student body card. Pro

I All four teams are fairly evenly

matched this year, with the senior
â€¢ outfit a slight favorite. The fourth
| year men gain their main strength
j from Austin Clapp, Frank Booth,
j Ward Woods, Larry Harris, and
j Mack Linton, a quintet that will be
j hard to out-splash.
The juniors boast a strong de

fensive team, and the sophomores
claim Ted Wiget, a member of the
varsity team, and a host of other's
' from last year's championship fresh
men. Coach Thornton characterizes
i the yearlings as having a "smooth
| working machine which may be able
to upset the manpower of the upper
i classmen."
