Two changes in schedules and the
addition of League VII to the intra
mural basketball tournament are
the highlights that marked the end
of the first week of Round I. And j
tonight, for those who like to see j
real form in casaba-handling, from i
previous reports and observation j
the Encina 2W contest with the vet- i
eral Business School men should j
prove of great interest.
League VII Formed
The latter, as in past seasons, are !
expected to live up to an established I
reputation of having a "hgtter-than- ,
average" squad and should prove J
the source of much trouble to the j
yearlings. Having a fair quintet, as j
shown in their practice games, the j
frosh depend mainly for their scor- j
ing power on young Bob Moore, who j
handles the forward position with- j
out any trouble at all. In top form, ,
this ouifit should go places in the j
mural tournament.
Gene Mires, intramural manager, j
revealed today that it has been de- j
cided to let the following organiza- j
4 ions, who signed up late for com- j
petition, form League VII and thus!
bring the total number of quintets |
entered up to 42: Menlo Hashers, i
Chinese Club, Beta Thcta Pi, En- :
sina lE, Sequoia 11, and Encina 2E. j

The Hashers will meet the Chi

Two changes in schedules and the
addition of League VII to the intra
mural basketball tournament are
the highlights that marked the end
of the first week of Round I. And j
tonight, for those who like to see j
real form in casaba-handling, from i
previous reports and observation j
the Encina 2W contest with the vet- i
eral Business School men should j
prove of great interest.
League VII Formed
The latter, as in past seasons, are !
expected to live up to an established I
reputation of having a "hgtter-than- ,
average" squad and should prove J
the source of much trouble to the j
yearlings. Having a fair quintet, as j
shown in their practice games, the j
frosh depend mainly for their scor- j
ing power on young Bob Moore, who j
handles the forward position with- j
out any trouble at all. In top form, ,
this ouifit should go places in the j
mural tournament.
Gene Mires, intramural manager, j
revealed today that it has been de- j
cided to let the following organiza- j
4 ions, who signed up late for com- j
petition, form League VII and thus!
bring the total number of quintets |
entered up to 42: Menlo Hashers, i
Chinese Club, Beta Thcta Pi, En- :
sina lE, Sequoia 11, and Encina 2E. j
Schedule Change
The Hashers will meet the Chi
nese Club Wednesday at 8 o'clock

test of this division, and Thursday
at 7 and 8 o'clock, respectively, the
Beta Theta Pi-Encina IE and the
Sequoia 11-Encina 2E games will be
held in the gym.
Originally scheduled for tomor
row evening, the El Capitan clash

switched with the Phi Delta Phi-
Kappa Sigma affair to Wednesday
night in the gym at 7 o'clock. The
latter game will be tomorrow at the
same time in the gym.
