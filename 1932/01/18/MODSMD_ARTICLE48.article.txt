# GOLF ROUNDS ARE DELAYED BY RAINS; TIME IS EXTENDED
## 
### 
I Unfavorable weather has so de- '
! layed the qualifying rounds for the [
freshman and varsity golf squads j
that it has been necessary to ex- |
tend the final date to Wednesday, j
January 20, announces E. M. Twiggs, 1
club pro.
The turnout of '32 men for the
varsity squad has been very pleas- j
ing, said Twiggs. The response from j
| the freshman ranks, on the other j
| hand, has not been so favorable, j
| only 14 of the yearlings having j
| signed up so far.
The freshman and varsity squads j
J will ultimately consist of 12 and 18 ;
j men, respectively.
