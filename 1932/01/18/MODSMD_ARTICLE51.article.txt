# TED WIGET SETS UNOFFICIAL PACIFIC COAST INTERCOLLEGIATE 440 RECORD
## 
### 
Ted Wiget, sophomore tank sen- j
sation, came through with an unof- ;
ficial Pacific Coast intercollegiate j
record for the 440-yard free style <;
in Friday's time trials. Stroking j
easily the whole distance, he fin- j
ished in the excellent time of i
4:59.2, no less than 6.8 seconds bet- j
ter than Buster Crabbe's Pacific
Coast mark. The national record, I
4:55.3, is only 3.9 seconds away, and i
some cxpect Wiget to clip at least j
that much from his present time j
when put under strain.
Bill Pogers, in the 100-yard back- !
stroke event, turned in the best j
time he has ever made, splashing 'â– 
over ihe distance in 1 minute 7.1 '
seconds. In a 220-yard mixed var- j
sity and freshman race, Triolo
walked off with first-place honors
in the absence of the real big guns,
finishing in 2:32.6 time, followed by
Schmidt and Taranik.
In the only other varsity event,
the 100-yard breaststroke, Mc-
Dowell swam alone, pulling in after
1 minute 16.6 seconds in the water.
Yearlings swam two other events,
the 100-yard breaststroke and 50-
yard freestyle. Fitting was the lone
entrant in the former, clocked at
1:12.2, and Cook barely beat out
Boothe in the latter. Cook's time
was 26.3 seconds, his competitor
finishing in 26.6. Most of the varsity '

men were taking it easy in prepara
tion for the imminent season this
quarter, and dicl not work in 11 if
trials.
