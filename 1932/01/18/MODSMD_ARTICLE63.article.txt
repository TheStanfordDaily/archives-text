# UNUSUAL PICTURES BY FAMOUS ARTIST WILL BE EXHIBITED
## Widely Travelled Painter's Work Will Be Shown In Art Gallery 
### 
An unusual exhibition of paint- j
ings by Seward . Hume Rathbun.
famous artist, will be shown in the ;
Stanford Art Gallery during the
next few days. Subjeets for the pic
lures range from studies of the j
sunny Californian missions to the j
Alaskan totems which stand in the
sombre shades of the forest.
Rathbun, at the present time, is
an instructor of art in Washington,
D.C. During his life he has traveled
widely, not only in the United |
States, but throughout Europe; and
through his wide experience he is !
able to bring to nearly any subject j
a wonderful understanding.
After his graduation from Har
vard he studied architecture for 1
some time. Although he did not take j
architecture as a life work, yet it j
has had a definite influence on his j
paintings. In all these is a mastery j
of architectural design with a great J
variety of atmosphere and color. [
Rath bun's color runs the gamut j
of values from light to dark, from !
warm to cold, with assured cfonfi- j
dence. liis brush stroke is as sure j
as the aiehitect's pencilled line. His
work is that of one who not only .
loves, but also knows.
