Willi but three minutes of play
remaining and desperately hoarding
a one-point lead, the Business
School last night came through with
two perfect drives for the basket
which left the final score 15 to 10
over 'lie highly touted Encina 2W
quintet.
In spite of the fact that both
squads possess the best teamwork
displayed thus far this season in
mural circles, none of the casaba
hurlers showed much of an eye for
the basket last night. Out of 17
free shots the veailings were able
lo sink but 2, while their opponents
did slightly better, sinking 3 out of
8. It is here that the frosh lost their
best chsnce to grab some extra
digits.
McDowell, Smith Star
Jack McDowell, lithe forward, and
Bill Smith, a guard from the School,
gave a last and sweet exhibition
both on offense and defense. Walt
Hill, Encina high point man, a
tricky guard named Bob Harvey,
and Bob Moore, starred for the los
ing five. Moore, being well-covei - ed,
seemed to have lost the eye for the
basket he had shown in practice
games.
Four baskets on the part of
"Chuck"' Gillespie, forward, ac
counted for 8 of the Deke's digits
run up in their 25-19 victory over
the Independents. Gillespie, the most
active man on the floor, was almost
equalled in performance by his
teammates, Campbell and Warren.
Mahakian and Henry were the chief
threats on the Independent squad.
Delts Defeat El Tigrc
Delta Tau Delta 14, El Tigrc 8,
markeji the story of a rather slow
game by many wasted set-ups which
could have sent the score jumping
either way at times'. However, the
Bow men found the basket a bit
more often, mainly through the
shooting eyes of Paul Griggs and
Ed Johnson. Andy Brown and Arch
Sampson played ag ood game for
the Club.
Theta Xi's 21 to 7 drubbing ad
ministered the Alpha Tau Omega
outfit was the most decisive of the
evening but failed to give much of
an indication of what the victors
may be expected to do. George
Sleeper, Theta Xi center, accounted
for 12 ot the 21 points. With plenty
of practice this quintet should be
in the running with the El Toro
and Los Arcos outfits for the
League 111 leadership.
All intramural teams are urged
not to participate in any contests
with teams other than those on the
campus, in accordance with the in
tramural rulings, Gene Mires, in

Willi but three minutes of play
remaining and desperately hoarding
a one-point lead, the Business
School last night came through with
two perfect drives for the basket
which left the final score 15 to 10
over 'lie highly touted Encina 2W
quintet.
In spite of the fact that both
squads possess the best teamwork
displayed thus far this season in
mural circles, none of the casaba
hurlers showed much of an eye for
the basket last night. Out of 17
free shots the veailings were able
lo sink but 2, while their opponents
did slightly better, sinking 3 out of
8. It is here that the frosh lost their
best chsnce to grab some extra
digits.
McDowell, Smith Star
Jack McDowell, lithe forward, and
Bill Smith, a guard from the School,
gave a last and sweet exhibition
both on offense and defense. Walt
Hill, Encina high point man, a
tricky guard named Bob Harvey,
and Bob Moore, starred for the los
ing five. Moore, being well-covei - ed,
seemed to have lost the eye for the
basket he had shown in practice
games.
Four baskets on the part of
"Chuck"' Gillespie, forward, ac
counted for 8 of the Deke's digits
run up in their 25-19 victory over
the Independents. Gillespie, the most
active man on the floor, was almost
equalled in performance by his
teammates, Campbell and Warren.
Mahakian and Henry were the chief
threats on the Independent squad.
Delts Defeat El Tigrc
Delta Tau Delta 14, El Tigrc 8,
markeji the story of a rather slow
game by many wasted set-ups which
could have sent the score jumping
either way at times'. However, the
Bow men found the basket a bit
more often, mainly through the
shooting eyes of Paul Griggs and
Ed Johnson. Andy Brown and Arch
Sampson played ag ood game for
the Club.
Theta Xi's 21 to 7 drubbing ad
ministered the Alpha Tau Omega
outfit was the most decisive of the
evening but failed to give much of
an indication of what the victors
may be expected to do. George
Sleeper, Theta Xi center, accounted
for 12 ot the 21 points. With plenty
of practice this quintet should be
in the running with the El Toro
and Los Arcos outfits for the
League 111 leadership.
All intramural teams are urged
not to participate in any contests
with teams other than those on the
campus, in accordance with the in
tramural rulings, Gene Mires, in
tramural manager, stated last night.
