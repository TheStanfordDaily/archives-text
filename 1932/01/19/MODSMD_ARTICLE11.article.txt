# DATE OF BEET VET UNDECIDED
## Managers Fail To Agree On I.C.A.A.A.A. Date 
### 
Meeting in Los Angeles last week
to discuss changing the date of the
1.C.4-A track meet, scheduled for
July 8 and 9 at Berkeley, A1 Mas
ters of Stanford, Bill Monahan of
California, and Willis Hunter of
U.S.C. were unable to come to a
definite decision until the matter
could be referred to their respective
boards of athletic control.
Both the Indian and Bear gradu
ate managers, as well as Troy's di
rector of athletics, would like to
move the meet up to July 1 and 2,
but the question turns upon the
possibility of guaranteeing Califor
nia a sum large enough to cover
the expenses of the meet.
Nothing final will be known until
some time in February, by which
time it is hoped the financial prob
lem will be solved. Monahan, al
though wanting the meet on the
earlier date so that it will not con
flict with the Olympic trials at
Stanford on July 15 and 16, fears
that the Fourth of July exodus will
deprive him of a crowd large enough
to pay the expenses of staging the
meet.
