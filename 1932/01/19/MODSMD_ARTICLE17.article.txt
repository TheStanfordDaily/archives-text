## New Group To Be Advised by Men's Council; Freshmen To Elect Nine Members January 25; Class Wants Perfect Four-Year Honor Code Record 
### 
T AKINCi what promises to he a major step in the successful operation
of *thc Honor Code at Stanford, members of the freshman class last
i night formed the framework for a Freshman Men's Honor Council, to
carry out (he spirit of the Code and to some extent to participate in the
disciplinary activities now assigned exclusively to the Men's Council.
The new council was formed by 25 freshman leaders meeting last night
in Toyon Hall with members of the Men's Council. Its organization is
solely a freshman initiative, the Men's Councilmen serving only as advisors.

Includes Nine Men
It will consist of nine members
clected by the class, and the first
election will be held Monday, Janu
ary 25. For this first time, a list *of
20 candidates will be chosen by the
Men's Council from a list of those
present at last night's meeting and
from those men nominated in writ
ing before next Friday, January 22.
These nominations may be made to
Aylett Cotton, freshman president.
Hereafter nominations and elections
will be conducted in the orthodox
manner.
"It is our ideal to build a tradi
tional respect for the Honor Code,"
said Cotton, who was in charge of
the meeting, "and if in so doing we
can make the Class of '35 the first
to go through Stanford without an
honor violation, so much the better.
E\cryone Fair Chance
"In selecting this first council, it
is hoped that every freshman man
will have a fair chance for nomina
tion, so we will hold meetings to
morrow and Thursday nights to ac
quaint all men interested with the
detaails of the organization."
These meetings will be held at
7:30 o'clock in the northeast reading
room of Toyon Hall, and will be in
charge of Milton Hand, Men's Coun
cil chairman.
Charles Flanagan, '35, active in
promoting last night's meeting, de
clared: "I believe we are on the
right track. We must put over the
idea that the Men's Council is not
a police force, but rather that it is
a court of honor. By establishing a
freshman council, we should be able
better than in any other way to
convey not only to this year's class,
but also to later classes, the idea
that the Honor Code is a matter
both of personal and of group
honor."
Disciplinary Action
The new council will exercise
certain disciplinary powers, but will
be limited in this respect by the
provisions of the A.S.S.U. constitu
tion.
"I wish to congratulate the Class
of '35 on its splendid spirit, and on
the way it has taken hold of the
Honor Code problem," Hand said.
"Our Council will give them the
fullest kind of co-operation, al
though simply in an advisory capa
city.
Ed Boyles and A1 Ray, other
Men's Council members at the
meeting, also expressed enthusiasm
at the freshmen's decisive move.
