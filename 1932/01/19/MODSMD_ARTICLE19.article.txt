The relief expedition of army bomb
ing planes returned to the base here
today after distributing 6500 pounds
of food to Navajo Indians, snow
j bound in the wastes of Northern
| Arizona.
It was the second trip the six
, planes, dispatched here from March
; Field, Riverside, have made over the
! territory and it brought the total
j amount of rations dropped to the
I Indians to 14,500 pounds.
"It's tough work; flying conditions
I arc not good," Lieutenant Charles
jH. Howard, in command of the
I planes, said. "We arc carrying
| guides, otherwise we would have
I considerable difficulty in locating the
I Indians.
"It has been quite interesting to
j watch them collect the food. They
j arc very grateful and after showing
J their appreciation by waving their
; hands and through other signs they
J whisk the food into their homes for
immediate consumption. Some don't
i even wait to do this, tearing it open
! where it lands."
