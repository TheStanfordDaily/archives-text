# SECRET BASKET PRACTICE HELD FOR BEAR TILT
## Strong California Quintet Yet To Hit Stride For Farm Invasion BUNN DRILLS OFFENSE Indians Must Win To Stay In Conference Race 
### Bob Wade 
With the rumblings caused by El
Trojan's invasion of the Farm still
re-echoing from the press and pub
lic alike, and Stanford back in a lie
for second place in conference
standings, Coach John Bunn last
night closed the Pavilion doors in
Mr. Public's face and set about
building an attack for the Berkeley
Bear.
Tlie California five invades the
campus for the first, set-to of the
annual throe-game series next Sat
urday night, and Bunn has no small
job ahead of him when he attempts
to push the ailing Indians back In
the position in which U.C.L.A. left
them a week ago.
Card Defense (loyd
The defense needs little attention.
Except for a few lapses during
which they allowed Pierce or Nemer
an unobstructed throw at the bas
ket, Lhe Redskins did a commend
able job of keeping the visitors
away from the home hoop.
With California reported as dis
playing '"fair weather" signs, in (In
form of a return to the rougher
game which they have used in the
past, Bunn is concentrating his ef
forts on a sure-fire offense which
will run up points in sufficient
quantity to insure victories for the
Indians.
Indians Tail to Shoot
The trouble with the Indian five
in the recent series, according to
Bunn, was that they invariably
waited vintil they could get
"Frenchy" LaCombc into scoring
position instead of taking a shot
when the opportunity presented.
With "Tiny Tom" Cordry on the
bench, this was the natural reaction
for a team that had counted on it.s
two star forwards lo take care of
the majority of the scoring burden.
California's overhead game gives
Bunn an excellent chance to show
his "Phog Allen" system off at its
best, and he is confident that Farm
fans are due to see a rejuvenated
Stanford basketball team lake the
first series from the Berkeley insti
tution in many moons.
Bears May Hit Stride
Both California and Stanford will
enter the series with the sole in
tention of remaining in the confer
ence rpce at the expense of the
other. Both have teams of doubtful
ability this year. The material is
there in each case, but it hasn't
functioned yet to the best of its
ability, except against the tail-end
U.C.L.A. five.
For the Bears, Joe Kintana, who
wrecked the Indian tepee last year
in the final game of the series, is
just rounding into shape. If Hcil
Eiffert, who almost alone defeated
the baby Rcdshirts as a freshman,
can catch his stride in the big time,
he and Kintana will make it hot
for the Stanford men. If he doesn't,
the Bears will have to pin their
hopes entirely on the veteran for
ward, and that is dangerous against
guards like Norgard and Edelen.
Cosgrovc Improves
Since Cordry's injury, Bunn has
been working Jack Cosgrove with
LaCombe. He has been improving
fast, and with another week's prac
tice behind him, he should be ready
to tank up a lot of points for the
home guard.

home guard.
With the rumblings caused by El
Trojan's invasion of the Farm still
re-echoing from the press and pub
lic alike, and Stanford back in a lie
for second place in conference
standings, Coach John Bunn last
night closed the Pavilion doors in
Mr. Public's face and set about
building an attack for the Berkeley
Bear.
Tlie California five invades the
campus for the first, set-to of the
annual throe-game series next Sat
urday night, and Bunn has no small
job ahead of him when he attempts
to push the ailing Indians back In
the position in which U.C.L.A. left
them a week ago.
Card Defense (loyd
The defense needs little attention.
Except for a few lapses during
which they allowed Pierce or Nemer
an unobstructed throw at the bas
ket, Lhe Redskins did a commend
able job of keeping the visitors
away from the home hoop.
With California reported as dis
playing '"fair weather" signs, in (In
form of a return to the rougher
game which they have used in the
past, Bunn is concentrating his ef
forts on a sure-fire offense which
will run up points in sufficient
quantity to insure victories for the
Indians.
Indians Tail to Shoot
The trouble with the Indian five
in the recent series, according to
Bunn, was that they invariably
waited vintil they could get
"Frenchy" LaCombc into scoring
position instead of taking a shot
when the opportunity presented.
With "Tiny Tom" Cordry on the
bench, this was the natural reaction
for a team that had counted on it.s
two star forwards lo take care of
the majority of the scoring burden.
California's overhead game gives
Bunn an excellent chance to show
his "Phog Allen" system off at its
best, and he is confident that Farm
fans are due to see a rejuvenated
Stanford basketball team lake the
first series from the Berkeley insti
tution in many moons.
Bears May Hit Stride
Both California and Stanford will
enter the series with the sole in
tention of remaining in the confer
ence rpce at the expense of the
other. Both have teams of doubtful
ability this year. The material is
there in each case, but it hasn't
functioned yet to the best of its
ability, except against the tail-end
U.C.L.A. five.
For the Bears, Joe Kintana, who
wrecked the Indian tepee last year
in the final game of the series, is
just rounding into shape. If Hcil
Eiffert, who almost alone defeated
the baby Rcdshirts as a freshman,
can catch his stride in the big time,
he and Kintana will make it hot
for the Stanford men. If he doesn't,
the Bears will have to pin their
hopes entirely on the veteran for
ward, and that is dangerous against
guards like Norgard and Edelen.
Cosgrovc Improves
Since Cordry's injury, Bunn has
been working Jack Cosgrove with
LaCombe. He has been improving
fast, and with another week's prac
tice behind him, he should be ready
to tank up a lot of points for the
home guard.
