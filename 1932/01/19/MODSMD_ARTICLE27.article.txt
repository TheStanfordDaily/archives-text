# DAVID STARR JORDAN
## 
### 
Il is dillicult to register in li'ue perspeelive llie greatness
of a man in a generation in which many people knew him
personally. We are still 100 close To David Starr Jordan;
we are only beginning to know the value, to recognize the
impression of the man. Time, like the abrasive used in
cutting precious stones, will uncover the lustre partially
hidden by the shell of familiarity.
Every man and woman intimately or remotely con
nected with Stanford I'niversity owes a debt of gratitude
to the leader who built so well that the name of Stanford
has gone throughout the world. His instrumentality in the
creation of educational opportunity, however, is only one
phase of activity in which his ability marked him as one
outstanding. Either his contributions to science or his ef
forts toward the realization of world peace, each taken
alone, wpuld have been sufficient.
Were lie living, Dr. Jordan would be 81 years old today.
Honor the memory of the man who built half his lifetime
into the spirit and tradition of Stanford.
