# MORE IDEALISM

In an adjoining column, the Hull Session, in today's
Daily the writer lakes exception to the editorial stand on
Walter JJppmann's (notice the two n's, Abe) interview
concerning football and universities.
As MellinkofV says, where the cause for overemphasis
lies, with the university, the press or the public, is unim
portant.
However, the Hull Session blames football for warping
the standard of college students. The ideal of practically
.•ill male students is the gridiron hero, il continues, and the
desire to push over the winning touchdown in the Big Game
is the crowning glory in the minds of masculine collegians.
Consequently, a cultural atmosphere in which students are
obsessed by a mad passion for knowledge remains nothing
more than a myth.
Granting, for the sake of argument, that football does
supersede learning in the interest of students. Does the
Varsity Hull Sessioncr imagine that if football were sud
denly eliminated, the ex-hero worshippers would find so
lace in their hooks? Not at all. Some other form of athle
tics would lake the place of football or students would bow
down before the best poker player on tin* campus. Perhaps
the desire to nul twenty yards through a broken field would
change to the ability to drink a gallon of beer at one sitting
or make more conquests among the S(H). Whatever turn
student interest would take is unimportant, but that a cul
tural craving would not displace football is a psychological
fact.
Although such a cultural atmosphere would probably
be highly desirable, its absence cannot be blamed on foot
ball. In such an unpicked assortment of students as attend
most universities such an atmosphere cannot be main
tained. Is il not better that some sport as football hold the
campus spotlight than have il transferred to a much less
wortliv interest?
