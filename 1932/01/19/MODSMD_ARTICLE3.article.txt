## New Offensive Undertaken In Retaliation 
### 
MUKDEN, Manchuria, Jan. 18 (/P).
—The Japanese arn\y has avenged
its dead. Official communiques said
today that hundreds of Chinese
have been killed in a series of of
fensives undertaken in retaliation
for the Chinese victories of last
week, in which the Japanese cas
ualties were heavy.
Supported by heavy artillery and
airplanes the avenging columns of
Japan killed at least 220 Chinese in
engagements at Ventai and Tung
laio, the communique said, and near
Yingkow where a force of 500 Chi
nese was encountered, a consider
able number of casualties was in
flicted.
Many Minor Battles
There were the three major en
gagements but there were many
others. Larger units were employed
than in previous activities of this
sort and more imposing auxiliary
arms.
While the Japanese pressed on
with their work of revenge, new
groups of Chinese war lords arrived
in Mukden to take part in negotia
tions looking toward the establish
ment of a new Manchurian State
wholly free of Chinese control.
General Shigeru Honjo, Japanese
high commander, explained the
fierceness of his new offensives by
saying it was necessary to rid south
Manchuria of the curse of banditry
in order to permit the Chinese
farmers to sow their spring crops
in "assurance of safety and peace."
