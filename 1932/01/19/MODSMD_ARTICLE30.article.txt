Shop.)
"A biography should either be as
long as Boswell's or as short as
Aubrey's," said Strachey in his
portrait of John Aubrey in this col
lection. "The method of enormous
and elaborate accretion which pro
duced the "Life of Johnson" is ex
eellent, no doubt; but, failing lhat,
let us have no half-measures; let
us have the pure essentials—a vivid
image, on a page or two, without
explanations, transitions, commen
taries, or padding."
A vivid image is certainly what
Strachey gives us in each of these
eighteen portraits, though his page
or two is really eight or ten pages.
There is a group under the heading
"Six English Historians," but the
other twelve subjects arc chosen
apparently not for their fame but
for the way in which they exem
plify in concrete form the essence
of their time. There is an Eliza
bethan courtier, the founder of an
obscure religious sect, a Cambridge
professor noted in his day, Madame
de Sevigne's cousin, the man who
got the better of Voltaire, and
others of those persons who are, in
a way, so much more interesting
than the truly great.
Strachey's epigrammatic style is
well fitted to this type of biography,
and is in itself enough to keep one's
interest. Also his use of the English
language is a thing of beauty and a
wonder to behold in this day and
age. —F.J.
THE TEMPERAMENTATS—At the
Palo Alto Community Theatre.
(Reviewed from dress rehearsal.)
Aurania Rouveral's latest comedy
differs violently from both the placid
"Skidding" and "It Never Rains."
This one goes sex with a consider
able and occasionally hilarious ven
geance.
At present it may hardly be ex
pected to be ready for Broadway.
The author loses herself somewhere
in the second act and, having
worked to two climaxes and a cur
tain, tries a third. Meanwhile she
forgets completely her characters,
and a person supposed to represent
a stern Back Bay. social flicker looks

very much like an actress without
a character looking very unneces
sarily emotional, fainting in the
manner of 1890, and recovering in
record time to fall down a flight of
stairs.
The second act rewritten, a hokey
ending removed from the first scene
of act one, the characters made
more believable and even, and
some of the third act silver cords
extracted from the gold—one may
judge the play's potentialities bet
tor.
The cr»sl at the Community Thea
tre exhibited, in general, an inex
perience in reading lines but, for
the most part, wore adequate. The
author, playing the lead, brought
professional experience welcomely
forward. In bits kindly little Sydney
Head as the physician, despite tra
ditional goatee and lengthy lines,
and Jean Rouveral as the youngest
Farnum were most real.
The play may be repeated.

RETURN f DARK NOT—By Mar

The spirit of the Sanger Circus
hovers over this amusing tale of a
mad week-end in the country.
Everyone falls in love with every
one else's wife and, subsequently,
involved conversations are held con
cerning the relative positions of the
single standard, love, duty, and
babies.
Hugo Pott, successful dramatist,
idol of a public to which he is con
sciously dutiful, has been invited to
the house party because he is clever.
Hugo fails miserably at entertain
ing, chiefly because a reperehensi
ble Lady Aggie is temporarily a
spiritual dyspeptic and. quite un
amusable. He finally decides, after
a nocturnal conversation with a
charming but severe young female
critic, to leave Ills plays and take
to farming.
Hugo, the heavy responsibility of
success, making him sag-should
dered, oflen suggests Noel Coward,
particularly the Noel of 1925 and
"The Vertex's" success.
Margaret Kennedy's work is de-
amusing, light, readable.
The book, satiric though never bit
terly sn, should prove popular.

portrait of John Aubrey in this col
lection. "The method of enormous
and elaborate accretion which pro
duced the "Life of Johnson" is ex
eellent, no doubt; but, failing lhat,
let us have no half-measures; let
us have the pure essentials—a vivid
image, on a page or two, without
explanations, transitions, commen
taries, or padding."
A vivid image is certainly what
Strachey gives us in each of these
eighteen portraits, though his page
or two is really eight or ten pages.
There is a group under the heading
"Six English Historians," but the
other twelve subjects arc chosen
apparently not for their fame but
for the way in which they exem
plify in concrete form the essence
of their time. There is an Eliza
bethan courtier, the founder of an
obscure religious sect, a Cambridge
professor noted in his day, Madame
de Sevigne's cousin, the man who
got the better of Voltaire, and
others of those persons who are, in
a way, so much more interesting
than the truly great.
Strachey's epigrammatic style is
well fitted to this type of biography,
and is in itself enough to keep one's
interest. Also his use of the English
language is a thing of beauty and a
wonder to behold in this day and
age. —F.J.

A vivid image is certainly what
Strachey gives us in each of these
eighteen portraits, though his page
or two is really eight or ten pages.
There is a group under the heading
"Six English Historians," but the
other twelve subjects arc chosen
apparently not for their fame but
for the way in which they exem
plify in concrete form the essence
of their time. There is an Eliza
bethan courtier, the founder of an
obscure religious sect, a Cambridge
professor noted in his day, Madame
de Sevigne's cousin, the man who
got the better of Voltaire, and
others of those persons who are, in
a way, so much more interesting
than the truly great.
Strachey's epigrammatic style is
well fitted to this type of biography,
and is in itself enough to keep one's
interest. Also his use of the English
language is a thing of beauty and a
wonder to behold in this day and
age. —F.J.
THE TEMPERAMENTATS—At the
Palo Alto Community Theatre.
(Reviewed from dress rehearsal.)
Aurania Rouveral's latest comedy
differs violently from both the placid
"Skidding" and "It Never Rains."
This one goes sex with a consider
able and occasionally hilarious ven
geance.
At present it may hardly be ex
pected to be ready for Broadway.
The author loses herself somewhere
in the second act and, having
worked to two climaxes and a cur
tain, tries a third. Meanwhile she
forgets completely her characters,
and a person supposed to represent
a stern Back Bay. social flicker looks

very much like an actress without
a character looking very unneces
sarily emotional, fainting in the
manner of 1890, and recovering in
record time to fall down a flight of
stairs.
The second act rewritten, a hokey
ending removed from the first scene
of act one, the characters made
more believable and even, and
some of the third act silver cords
extracted from the gold—one may
judge the play's potentialities bet
tor.
The cr»sl at the Community Thea
tre exhibited, in general, an inex
perience in reading lines but, for
the most part, wore adequate. The
author, playing the lead, brought
professional experience welcomely
forward. In bits kindly little Sydney
Head as the physician, despite tra
ditional goatee and lengthy lines,
and Jean Rouveral as the youngest
Farnum were most real.
The play may be repeated.

RETURN f DARK NOT—By Mar
garet Kennedy. Doubleday Doran,
New York, 1931. $2.50. (At the
Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
The spirit of the Sanger Circus
hovers over this amusing tale of a
mad week-end in the country.
Everyone falls in love with every
one else's wife and, subsequently,
involved conversations are held con
cerning the relative positions of the
single standard, love, duty, and
babies.
Hugo Pott, successful dramatist,
idol of a public to which he is con
sciously dutiful, has been invited to
the house party because he is clever.
Hugo fails miserably at entertain
ing, chiefly because a reperehensi
ble Lady Aggie is temporarily a
spiritual dyspeptic and. quite un
amusable. He finally decides, after
a nocturnal conversation with a
charming but severe young female
critic, to leave Ills plays and take
to farming.
Hugo, the heavy responsibility of
success, making him sag-should
dered, oflen suggests Noel Coward,
particularly the Noel of 1925 and
"The Vertex's" success.
Margaret Kennedy's work is de-
amusing, light, readable.
The book, satiric though never bit
terly sn, should prove popular.

Shop.)
"A biography should either be as
long as Boswell's or as short as
Aubrey's," said Strachey in his
portrait of John Aubrey in this col
lection. "The method of enormous
and elaborate accretion which pro
duced the "Life of Johnson" is ex
eellent, no doubt; but, failing lhat,
let us have no half-measures; let
us have the pure essentials—a vivid
image, on a page or two, without
explanations, transitions, commen
taries, or padding."
A vivid image is certainly what
Strachey gives us in each of these
eighteen portraits, though his page
or two is really eight or ten pages.
