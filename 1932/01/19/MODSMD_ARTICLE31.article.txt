# BULL SESSION
## FOOTBALL AND A COLLEGE EDUCATION 
### 
Waller Lippman claims that col
lege causes the emphasis on foot
ball; the Daily feels that newspapers
are the cause. And finally in order
of decreasing importance, the Bull
Session believes that both cause the
over-emphasis. Further, I fail to see
what, difference it makes which is
the cause as long as the effect is
realized. The only value of fixing
the cause is so that we can lay the
blame; iri this case, it would mean
attacking one of two worthy insti
tutions—college or the press.
Let's exonerate both of them and
indict something that cannot arouse
emotions or defenders and thus fog
the issue. We nominate as High and
Exalted Causes —All of over-em
phasis cn football—the sun spots
which some say cause depressions.
And if sun spots are too far away,
"The Unthinking Public" or "Mob
Psychology" are two good goats—
general enough to be all inclusive;
and yet vague enough so that no one
would care to defend them, and if
one did desire to rise in their de
fense, one wouldn't know what to
defend. A perfect goat!
The Daily editorial is correct
when it states that the disadvan
tages in football are idealistic; but
when iL states that the faults are
also mythical, we must take excep
tion. The real harm of football is
not to the men that play; they are
too few. Football warps the stand
ard of all the students. In almost
four years at university we have
met only two men who did not con
sider the greatest honor and joy in
college to be the hard-hitting, tricky,
long-punting quarterback who could
reel off twenty yards against any

j team at will. I was neither of them.
The result is that ' the much
talked-cf academic ideal remains
j nothing more than a much-talked
jof ideal. Consciously or uncon
-1 sciously, our estimation of study and
j studies falls—if it ever did exist.
The wonder is how we ever get any
work done. But more important
than doing the little grinding that
| is necessary to stay in school, is our
' attitude. A cultural craving—an in
| tellectual interest are impossible in
| an atmosphere that does not place
j (he greatest emphasis on these
j things. They are not easy and like
i exotic plants must be watered and
nurtured with infinite patience and
care. But where they are walked
on, trampled down, starved for the
sunlight of general approval, and
kicked in the face—their absence is
not strange.
j
j Lippman's statement that the cure
j lies within the university is little
more than hopefully possible. The
probability and feasibility of change
is infinitely small. Colleges have
mortgaged themselves to a point
that only continued high-pressure
i football can begin to repay the
debt; huge stadiums are not paid
j for. Also, some colleges have long
icontracts with highly paid coaches.
The huge income from football is
j too juicy a plum to be lost for some
j ideal; close to half a million dollars
tis involved in our "Big Game"
alone. The alumni, who pay for most
universities, must never be forgot
! ten. And lastly, football is natural
| for youth; education is artificial and
made for graybeards. Plato recog
j razed it and modern colleges are
1 proving it. —Abe Mellinkoff

Waller Lippman claims that col
lege causes the emphasis on foot
ball; the Daily feels that newspapers
are the cause. And finally in order
of decreasing importance, the Bull
Session believes that both cause the
over-emphasis. Further, I fail to see
what, difference it makes which is
the cause as long as the effect is
realized. The only value of fixing
the cause is so that we can lay the
blame; iri this case, it would mean
attacking one of two worthy insti
tutions—college or the press.
Let's exonerate both of them and
indict something that cannot arouse
emotions or defenders and thus fog
the issue. We nominate as High and
Exalted Causes —All of over-em
phasis cn football—the sun spots
which some say cause depressions.
And if sun spots are too far away,
"The Unthinking Public" or "Mob
Psychology" are two good goats—
general enough to be all inclusive;
and yet vague enough so that no one
would care to defend them, and if
one did desire to rise in their de
fense, one wouldn't know what to
defend. A perfect goat!
The Daily editorial is correct
when it states that the disadvan
tages in football are idealistic; but
when iL states that the faults are
also mythical, we must take excep
tion. The real harm of football is
not to the men that play; they are
too few. Football warps the stand
ard of all the students. In almost
four years at university we have
