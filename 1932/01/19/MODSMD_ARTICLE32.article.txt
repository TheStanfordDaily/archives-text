The Editor, Sir:
Some kind of marking system is
accepted as part of the scheme of
things in most educational institu
tions. Instructors of many courses,
some of them not very large, are
often unable or unwilling to give
their students the individual atten
tion which the reading of papers
and reports requires. Readers, to
assist instructors in the grading of
students of large classes, seem to he
a necessity.
Let us admit, for the time being,
that marking systems can and
should be designed to contribute to
the educational objectives of a uni
versity and of each of the courses
which it offers. It follows that those
who take part in grading must meet
certain standards, otherwise inade
quate grading will result and this
in turn will operate against the best
interests of course work. This docs
not mean that there should be uni
formity throughout a university, or
even within a department, in meth
ods of measurement. However, in

readers, together they should ad
here to plans which they have
worked out in advance for measur
ing student achievement and for
discussing papers with students.
There are many courses in which
the readers assist instructors in en
tirely satisfactory ways. There are
a few courses in which class morale
has been considerably disrupted by
unsatisfactory relations between
students and readers, and conse
quently between students and in
structors, arising out of whimsical
| and sketchy attempts at validation
j of positions taken by readers on de
i batable points. Another complaint is
' the failure to indicate, on papers
[ returned ,any grades or criticisms,
j leaving the student in suspense re-
I garding his relations to his work
Junlil it is too late for him to ad
just himself. Of course it is only
fair to mention the pleasant sur
prises which some honest students
admit htiving received in their final
grades.
The writers hold the following

standards to bte desirable:
First, that readers shall have com
pleted the courses in which they
are assisting, or their equivalents,
with records of high achievement,
before they begin their duties as
readers.
Second, that readers be known
and accessible to all members of
the class. There can be little objec
tion to this when the readers are
well chosen. Secrecy in this connec
tion implies weakness.
Third, that there be no sub-letting
of the work assigned by the in
structor to the readers. Readers who
structors should hold themselves
responsible for the work of their
have insufficient time to do their
work as readers adequately should
riot be appointed. Possibly the in
structor should insist that his read
ers reduce their study loads below
their normal maxima to the extent
of the number of the credits of the
courses for which they are readers.
In closing, the writers wish it
clearly understood that they have
no axe to grind either in behalf of
students with generally low grades
or those who aspire merely to get
high grades. Also they consider that
definitely poor performances by
readers are the exception rather
than the common practice at Stan
ford. At the same time, a little more
attention to these details on the part
of many instructors would convert
merely fair performance by many
readers into very good performance.
Possibly the Associated Students
should request the Administration
to consider setting up some such
standards as these or perhaps to
hold a discussion on them in a con
ference representing the Academic
Council and the Associated Students.
