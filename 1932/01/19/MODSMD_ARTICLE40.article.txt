AFTER DROPPING eight of nine
lames played on their triumphal
tour of (he Midwest, the University
>1 Southern California Trojans re
urned to the coast to demonstrate
hat : I least they had learned some
hing in the process. Hardly con
ceded a chance at the start of the
conference schedule, the southern
luintet is now roosting safely on
top of the heap, with four wins and
io losses.
The question of course arises as
to who will be able to stop the
IVrrible Trojans. Stanford almost
lid it Saturday night, and may be
; bio to do something about the mat
it r in the remaining pair of .games
to bo played at Los Angeles next
month. Since the scene of action
will be the Olympic Auditorium in
Los Angeles, however the chances
oe that the U.S.C. quintet will win
tl least one of the two contests.
California appears in the best
position to do the Trojans seri
ous damage, with two games yet
to be played in the Oakland
Auditorium. The Bears started
functioning for the first time in
winning twice from U.C.L.A.,
and are by no means out of the
conference race.
Meanwhile, should Stanford come
jiil ori top in the Big Series and
win at least one game from U.S.C.
Willi California taking two, the In
dians would find themselves very
much in the running.
The U.C.L.A. hoopsters, with four
straight defeats chalked up against
them, seem out of championship
consideration, but there is still the
chance that the Bruins will mess up
somebody else's chances—and it
ini",ht be El Trojan's.
IF YOU ask us:
JERRY NEMER, the Trojans' star
forward, lives up to the great repu
tation the press has built for him.
He is a marvelous natural shot,
sinking baskets from any corner of
th< court under any conditions. He
scored .18 points against Stanford
I iiday night, and although closely
watched, tallied 13 more Saturday.
" "FRENCHY" LACOMBE was"not
far bchird, however, with 16 points
in the first game and 11 in the sec
ond. Many of his shots were beau
ties, either being one-handed flips
from near the basket, or long ones
from the center of the court.
JOHN HANCOCK, big, slow, and
almost awkward substitute center,
was the surprise of the series. His
toady work was one of the things
that kept Stanford in either game,
while his three field goals nearly
won Saturday's fray.
REGGIE MEADE was in form for
'he fii t time this season, and played
v.-'ll Saturday night.
WILLI LAM LEISER has a good
iie for the Trojans. He calls them
"foul stealers." —L.M.C.

ceded a chance at the start of the
conference schedule, the southern
luintet is now roosting safely on
top of the heap, with four wins and
io losses.
The question of course arises as
to who will be able to stop the
IVrrible Trojans. Stanford almost
lid it Saturday night, and may be
; bio to do something about the mat
it r in the remaining pair of .games
to bo played at Los Angeles next
month. Since the scene of action
will be the Olympic Auditorium in
Los Angeles, however the chances
oe that the U.S.C. quintet will win
tl least one of the two contests.
California appears in the best
position to do the Trojans seri
ous damage, with two games yet
to be played in the Oakland
Auditorium. The Bears started
functioning for the first time in
winning twice from U.C.L.A.,
and are by no means out of the
conference race.
Meanwhile, should Stanford come
jiil ori top in the Big Series and
win at least one game from U.S.C.
Willi California taking two, the In
dians would find themselves very
much in the running.
The U.C.L.A. hoopsters, with four
straight defeats chalked up against
them, seem out of championship
consideration, but there is still the
chance that the Bruins will mess up
somebody else's chances—and it
ini",ht be El Trojan's.
IF YOU ask us:
JERRY NEMER, the Trojans' star
forward, lives up to the great repu
tation the press has built for him.
He is a marvelous natural shot,
sinking baskets from any corner of
th< court under any conditions. He
scored .18 points against Stanford
I iiday night, and although closely
watched, tallied 13 more Saturday.
" "FRENCHY" LACOMBE was"not
far bchird, however, with 16 points
in the first game and 11 in the sec
ond. Many of his shots were beau
ties, either being one-handed flips
from near the basket, or long ones
from the center of the court.
JOHN HANCOCK, big, slow, and
almost awkward substitute center,
was the surprise of the series. His
toady work was one of the things
that kept Stanford in either game,
while his three field goals nearly
won Saturday's fray.
REGGIE MEADE was in form for
'he fii t time this season, and played
v.-'ll Saturday night.
WILLI LAM LEISER has a good
iie for the Trojans. He calls them
"foul stealers." —L.M.C.
