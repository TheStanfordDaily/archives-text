# Improved Yearling Hoop Team To Face Bears
## U.C. FROSH SQUAD IS DARK HORSE OF LITTLE BIG SERIES Berkeleyans Have Record Of Three Defeats In Three Starts 
### Albert Guerard 
The zero hour for Stanford fresh
rji in basketball players is just four
days off. On Saturday night a rap
idly impioving Indian yearling quin
tet will open the Little Big Series
against a dark-horse California
freshman live that has met defeat
in its first three starts, but that like
the Indian babes appears to be
rounding into mid-season form with
the coming of the season's first big
objective.
A defeat by the Olympic Club
145-pound team opened the season
for the Bear Cubs, but on the fol
lowing week-end the Californians
held the strong Stockton High five
to a 19-"14 score. The latter game is
the only direct means of comparing
the two yearling fives, since the
Stanford freshmen nosed out the
Stockton five, 22-21, in a hair-rais
ing lait-minute finish. But it is
doubtful if this six-point paper ad
vantage is going to mean much to
the two rival teams whop they take
the floor on Saturday night to whet
the appetite of the Big Game crowd.
The most encouraging (to Stan
ford) defeat of all came on last
Thursday when the Californians
were "nosed out" by Lowell High,
36-7. The half-time score of the
rout was 22-1 in favor of the San
Francisco prepsters, which stacks
up well against that 10-1 lead the
Palo Alto Vikings had at the inter
mission of the baby Redskins' first
contest.
Two football players, Dave Meeks
and Joe Darracq, are the big guns
which Berkeley will shoot across
the bay against Coach Vance Faw
cett's young hopefuls. Meeks is a
center, while Darracq is a guard. At
the other guard position Harrisson
and Ross, two inexperienced men,
are fighting for a place in the start
ing lineup, while Bauer and Mor
gans dominate the forward situa
tion.
