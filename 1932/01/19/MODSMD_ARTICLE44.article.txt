# STANFORD FENCERS TO BATTLE FRIDAY FOR DIVISION TITLE
## 
### 
With the first of the Amateur
Fencers' League of America meets
scheduled for Friday night at 8
o'clock in Encina Gym, Stanford
fencers will swing into action for
the first time this year. Friday's
meet is for the Bay Division incli
vidual and team championships in
the saber, and the winning men as
well as the winning squad will rep
resent the northern, division of the
Pacific Coast in the Pacific Coast
finals. *
The three saber artists who rep
resented Stanford last year are all
back, and they have a fine chance
of winning the title. The two Pock
mans. and Ji nl Reed will fence for
the Indians as a team, although any
others who wish tq enter may do
so, as the meet is an open one. Cap
tain Leonard Pockman is the Pacific
Coast junior champion in the saber,
and is one of the favorites for in
dividual honors.
The Olympic Club, the defending
champions, will enter a strong team,
and it is possible that California
will be represented by a squad. The
meet will be especially valuable as
it will throw some light on the
chances of certain of the Stanford
fencers making the American Olym
pic team.
