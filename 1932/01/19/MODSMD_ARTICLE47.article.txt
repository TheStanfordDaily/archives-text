# FOUR CARD SPRINTERS HOPE TO REDUCE WYKOFF TO RANK OF ORDINARY RUNNER
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
For two years one Frank WykofT
of the Terrible Trojan Track Team !
has monopolized the tape in all j
100-yard dash races and has taken I
five points in the 220 witli unpleas- ;
ant regularity. Hec Dyer managed j
to grab first honors in the furlong
a few times, but the "world's fastest
human" has always, with one ex
ception, led the Stanford speedsters
to the tape in the shorter race.
The Cardinal sprinters hope to
take up this season where Dyer left j
off wh'jn he graduated, and to re- j
duce the flashy WykofT to the ranks ■
of the ordinary mortals. The Indian !
Dash Quartet includes Les Hables, '
Frank Lombardi, Ralph Giberson, |
and Jimmy Willson, among whom j
Hables stands out as the only es
tablished star.
Nearly Beats Wykoff
Although Hables has never beaten
WykofT, he came so close on one
occasion that the Black Streak had j
to set a new world's record to win.
That was in the A.A.U. Southern
championships in 1930, and WykofT !
was clocked in 9.4 with Hables a ;
foot behind. That same year, Les!
was officially timed in 9.5 when he |
beat Dyer and Russ Sweet in the
100 in the P.A.A. championships.
For two years, 1929 and 1920,
Hables was ineligible for the Indian ,
team, but last season, in spile of
numerous injuries, he managed to j
make his presence felt in several
meets. Les took second in the 440
and rail the relay against U.S.C.,
and he helped his brother Alvin,
Ben Eastman, and Maynor Shove
break the world's mile relay record
at Fresno.
Shines in 1.C.4-A.
It was in the 1.C.4-A's last year,
however, that Hables really found
himself. In good condition for the
first time in a big meet, Les took a
second in the 220 and a fourth in
the 100. An appendicitis operation
kept Hables out of track for a time
this year, but yesterday he took his
first real workout since the middle
of last quarter.
Lombardi left high school with a
track record almost identical with
Wykoff's. They had met six times,
and each had won on three occa
sions; they were and still are co
holders of the world's interscholas
tic record in the 220; and Lombardi
had beaten WykofT to set a new
mark of :9.6 for the hundred that

still stands as a world's high school
I record.
| Lombardi, however, then stayed
j out of .school a year, and last season
j was his first of intercollegiate com
! petition. Like liables, Frank was
! bothered with injuries just as he
j was getling in shape. A leg that he
hurt the week after the Big Meet 1
kept Lombardi from going East and 1
also from placing in the U.S.C. meet.
In last year's Big Meet, Lombardi
| got second in both the dashes, and
i he hopes to do as well against Troy
| this season. Frank claims that he
j has completely recovered from his
1 injury, in which case Hables may
• receive a" bit of competition from
I within the ranks.
Giberson Was Unknown
Comparatively speaking, Giber
son was an unknown when he en
tered Sianford, but he made his
presence felt all over the country
when he placed fourth in the
j 1.C.4-A. 100-yard dash in his sopho
! more year. That season Gibey also
j was second in the 100 and third in
j the 221) in the Big Meet.
j Then the old injury jinx got Gi
i berson, and he spent the 1931 track
j season limping around on a pulled
leg muscle. So far this year, Gibey
appears to have forgotten his in
jury, and he has been taking down
j all boys in the practice meets. If he
; can perfect the "gather" on which
j he has been working, Giberson may
| be one of the country's leaders in
| ihe 100, as his start is as good as
! that of any sprinter now running.
Willson Injured
! Like the other man already dis
| cussed, Willson came to Stanford
j and then injured himself. Jimmy
| had won the 100 in : 10.1 and the 220
|in :22.2 in the first meet of last
I year's freshman season, when he
I pulled a muscle running the relay.
! As a high-school star, Willson
j was good enough to be given a
place on Spaulding's ail-American
' interscholastic track team in 1929.
I In that year Willson won both the
dashes in the California state meet,
recording times of :9.8 and :21.4.

ception, led the Stanford speedsters
to the tape in the shorter race.
The Cardinal sprinters hope to
take up this season where Dyer left j
off wh'jn he graduated, and to re- j
duce the flashy WykofT to the ranks ■
of the ordinary mortals. The Indian !
Dash Quartet includes Les Hables, '
Frank Lombardi, Ralph Giberson, |
and Jimmy Willson, among whom j
Hables stands out as the only es
tablished star.
Nearly Beats Wykoff
Although Hables has never beaten
WykofT, he came so close on one
occasion that the Black Streak had j
to set a new world's record to win.
That was in the A.A.U. Southern
championships in 1930, and WykofT !
was clocked in 9.4 with Hables a ;
foot behind. That same year, Les!
was officially timed in 9.5 when he |
beat Dyer and Russ Sweet in the
100 in the P.A.A. championships.
For two years, 1929 and 1920,
Hables was ineligible for the Indian ,
team, but last season, in spile of
numerous injuries, he managed to j
make his presence felt in several
meets. Les took second in the 440
and rail the relay against U.S.C.,
and he helped his brother Alvin,
Ben Eastman, and Maynor Shove
break the world's mile relay record
at Fresno.
Shines in 1.C.4-A.
It was in the 1.C.4-A's last year,
however, that Hables really found
himself. In good condition for the
first time in a big meet, Les took a
second in the 220 and a fourth in
the 100. An appendicitis operation
kept Hables out of track for a time
this year, but yesterday he took his
first real workout since the middle
of last quarter.
Lombardi left high school with a
track record almost identical with
Wykoff's. They had met six times,
and each had won on three occa
sions; they were and still are co
holders of the world's interscholas
tic record in the 220; and Lombardi
had beaten WykofT to set a new
mark of :9.6 for the hundred that

| Lombardi, however, then stayed
j out of .school a year, and last season
j was his first of intercollegiate com

! bothered with injuries just as he
j was getling in shape. A leg that he
hurt the week after the Big Meet 1
kept Lombardi from going East and 1
also from placing in the U.S.C. meet.
In last year's Big Meet, Lombardi
| got second in both the dashes, and
i he hopes to do as well against Troy
| this season. Frank claims that he
j has completely recovered from his

I within the ranks.
Giberson Was Unknown
Comparatively speaking, Giber
son was an unknown when he en
tered Sianford, but he made his
presence felt all over the country
when he placed fourth in the

j was second in the 100 and third in
j the 221) in the Big Meet.
j Then the old injury jinx got Gi
i berson, and he spent the 1931 track
j season limping around on a pulled
leg muscle. So far this year, Gibey
appears to have forgotten his in
jury, and he has been taking down
j all boys in the practice meets. If he
; can perfect the "gather" on which
j he has been working, Giberson may
| be one of the country's leaders in
| ihe 100, as his start is as good as
! that of any sprinter now running.
Willson Injured

j and then injured himself. Jimmy

I pulled a muscle running the relay.

j was good enough to be given a

tablished star.
Nearly Beats Wykoff
Although Hables has never beaten
WykofT, he came so close on one
occasion that the Black Streak had j
to set a new world's record to win.
That was in the A.A.U. Southern
championships in 1930, and WykofT !
was clocked in 9.4 with Hables a ;
foot behind. That same year, Les!
was officially timed in 9.5 when he |
beat Dyer and Russ Sweet in the
100 in the P.A.A. championships.
For two years, 1929 and 1920,
Hables was ineligible for the Indian ,
team, but last season, in spile of
numerous injuries, he managed to j
make his presence felt in several
meets. Les took second in the 440
and rail the relay against U.S.C.,
and he helped his brother Alvin,
Ben Eastman, and Maynor Shove
break the world's mile relay record
at Fresno.
Shines in 1.C.4-A.
It was in the 1.C.4-A's last year,
however, that Hables really found
himself. In good condition for the
first time in a big meet, Les took a
second in the 220 and a fourth in
the 100. An appendicitis operation
kept Hables out of track for a time
this year, but yesterday he took his
first real workout since the middle
of last quarter.
Lombardi left high school with a
track record almost identical with
Wykoff's. They had met six times,
and each had won on three occa
sions; they were and still are co
holders of the world's interscholas
tic record in the 220; and Lombardi
had beaten WykofT to set a new
mark of :9.6 for the hundred that

| Lombardi, however, then stayed
j out of .school a year, and last season
j was his first of intercollegiate com
! petition. Like liables, Frank was
! bothered with injuries just as he
j was getling in shape. A leg that he
hurt the week after the Big Meet 1
kept Lombardi from going East and 1
also from placing in the U.S.C. meet.
In last year's Big Meet, Lombardi
| got second in both the dashes, and
i he hopes to do as well against Troy
| this season. Frank claims that he
j has completely recovered from his
1 injury, in which case Hables may
• receive a" bit of competition from
I within the ranks.
Giberson Was Unknown
Comparatively speaking, Giber
son was an unknown when he en
tered Sianford, but he made his
presence felt all over the country
when he placed fourth in the
j 1.C.4-A. 100-yard dash in his sopho
! more year. That season Gibey also
j was second in the 100 and third in
j the 221) in the Big Meet.
j Then the old injury jinx got Gi
i berson, and he spent the 1931 track
j season limping around on a pulled
leg muscle. So far this year, Gibey
appears to have forgotten his in
jury, and he has been taking down
j all boys in the practice meets. If he
; can perfect the "gather" on which
j he has been working, Giberson may
| be one of the country's leaders in
| ihe 100, as his start is as good as
! that of any sprinter now running.
Willson Injured
! Like the other man already dis
| cussed, Willson came to Stanford
j and then injured himself. Jimmy
| had won the 100 in : 10.1 and the 220
|in :22.2 in the first meet of last
I year's freshman season, when he
I pulled a muscle running the relay.
! As a high-school star, Willson
j was good enough to be given a
place on Spaulding's ail-American
' interscholastic track team in 1929.
I In that year Willson won both the
dashes in the California state meet,
recording times of :9.8 and :21.4.
Jimmy claims, as do Hables, Lom-

five points in the 220 witli unpleas- ;

to grab first honors in the furlong
a few times, but the "world's fastest
human" has always, with one ex
ception, led the Stanford speedsters
to the tape in the shorter race.

take up this season where Dyer left j
off wh'jn he graduated, and to re- j

of the ordinary mortals. The Indian !
