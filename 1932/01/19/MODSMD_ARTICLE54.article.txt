# MURAL MEET SET FOR TODAY; GOOD WEATHER NEEDED
## Delay Aids Conditioning Of Men; Breakers-El Toro Duel 
### 
Weather permitting, the intra
mural track meet will finally be run
off this afternoon starting at 4
o'clock sharp. Both the track and
the jumping and weight pits, which
have been .worrying Coach Bill El-
I lington, were in good enough shape
| yesterday that another dry day will
! put thtm in first class condition.
: The numerous postponements of
I the meet have allowed some of the
j prospective stars to round into
1 shape, while others have found the
I inclement weather disadvantageous
i to their conditioning. Nevertheless,
| most of : Ihe events should be closely
| contested, and there is a possibility
I of new records in several races, no
i taj)ly the half-mile and the low
i hurdles.
If the Breakers-El Toro rivalry
j turns out to be as close as is prom
: ised, the winning team in the meet
I may be decided by the relay. Her
j bert, Reed, Byrd, and Wright will
I probably run for Toro, while Gor
i don, Fullenwider, Ferrie, and an
! unknown fourth man will comprise
| the Breakers team.
