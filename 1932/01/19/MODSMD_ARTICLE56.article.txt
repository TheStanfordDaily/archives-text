# FRANCE FORESEES POSTPONEMENT OF REPARATION MEET
## Laval Forwards Elections Of World As Reason Of Expectation 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 19. (/Pi (Tuesday) (/P)
—The French Government let it be
known today that it was envisaging
at least a provisional postponement
of the Lausanne Reparations Con
ference.
A semi-official note was issued at
midnight after Premier Pierre Laval
had talked with Leopold von
Hoesch, German Ambassador to
Paris.
"Solution Impossible"
The elections due this year in
France, Germany, and the United
States were given in the note as the
reasons for the contemplated post
ponement of the conference, which
is tentatively scheduled to meet
next Monday.
"The opinion is becoming more
and more general in the interested
international sphere," the note said,
"that it is impossible to arrive now
at a detailed and definite solution
of the problems of reparations and
war debts."
No Extension Sought
LONDON, Jan. 18. (/I 3 ) —Authori-
tative quarters today denied reports
that overtures would be made to
the United States for an extension
of the Hoover intergovernmental
debt moratorium.
An attempt to obtain an exten
sion, these sources asserted, is not
necessary for the successful com
pletion of the work facing the in
ternational reparations conference
tentatively scheduled for January
25 at Lausanne. '
Decision After Election
London newspapers have pre
dicted that the Lausanne conference
will make no final decision until
the presidential election in the
United States is over, but a compe
tent spokesman said such reports
were erroneous.
