# WISCONSIN U. LAW STUDENTS CHARGE CAMPUS COURT IS ILLEGAL; MAP FIGHT
## 
### 
MADISON, Wis., Jan. 18. (TP)—
| Led by four* student lawyers, a
j number of undergraduates at the
j University of Wisconsin today were
| in open rebellion against the cam
! pus traffic court and planned to
| carry their fight to the state su-
I preme court —if they can raise
| enough money.
The students said they hoped the
i rebellion would spread to other
| schools, where fines are collected
I from students for violation of cam-
I pus rules.
The four law students, members
j of Phi Delta Phi, professional law
i fraternity, today dug through law
J books as they collected precedents
i which they said uphold their posi
tion that the fine system is uncon
stitutional and illegal.
The trouble is occasioned by the
recent appointment by President
Glenn Frank of a court to hear

cases of students accused of violat
ing the campus automobile traffic
rules. At the court's initial session
last Wednesday $1 fines were as
sessed six students; those who ig
nored traffic tickets drew double
fines.
The eouil meets again Wednesday,
and the law students are acting as
counsel for all students who apply.
"We have four cases for Wednes
day," the law students said, "we're
going to plead guilty, pay each fine
under protest, and then in a civic
action in the Dane county courts,
sue to get the money back. Also, we
cxpect to institute an injunctional
move in circuit court to halt"further
operation of the court."
The students maintain the court
is illegally appointed; that it does
not have constitutional authority to
levy and collect fines and that it in
fringes upon the jurisdiction of
municipal courts.
