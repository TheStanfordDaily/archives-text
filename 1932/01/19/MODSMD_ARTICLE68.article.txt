### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 18. (/P)—Organ
; izcd railway labor asked by th(
; management to accept 10 per cen'
wage reductions for one year, in
quired today if the carriers would
I be willing to increase employment
|by approximately the same per
| centage.
In the negotiations between rail
presidents and heads of brother
j hoods and unions, the labor delega
j tion had originally asked that "an
j average force" be assured employ
| ment for one year. The presidents,
j stating in a general way that the
j wage reduction would stimulate em
ployment but at the same time
! doubting that they could give defi
! nite assurance of employment, had
• asked for a more detailed sugges-
I tion.
