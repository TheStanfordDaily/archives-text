MUKDEN, Manchuria, Jan.
18. (/P) â€”For the first time in
history a war will be halted
tomorrow so that a comman
der-in-chief may broadcast.
The Japanese-Chinese con
flict in Manchuria will be
stopped at 4:15 o'clock tomor
row afternoon, by consent of
both sides, so that General
Shigeru Honjo, Japanese com
mander, may broadcast the
horrors of war to America.
Guns will cease firing while
short-wave links America and
the Orient. The General's re
marks, which will be in Japa
nese, will be delivered at Muk
