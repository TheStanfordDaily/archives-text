# BOOKSTORE TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY REBATES TOMORROW
## 
### 
Regular quarterly rebates will be
paid by the Stanford Bookstore to
morrow from 8 until 5 o'clock. The
payments will cover all purchases
made during the fall quarter, with
a rebate of 4 per cent on all pur
chases for which slips have been
signed and deposited. Any payments
due from summer quarter which
were not collected then will be paid
this quarter.
Rebates for the summer quarter
were also on the basis of 4 per cent,
but in previous quarters 5 or 6 per
cent was allowed. The lowering of
the rates is due to a decline in
business. The volume for the fall
quarter was estimated at $5,000 be
low normal.
Since January 1 rebate slips have
not been given for purchases of
less than 50 cents, since such pur
chases, while totaling about half of
the total transactions in volume,
amounted to only 3 per cent in
value. This increased clerical and
bookkeeping costs and cut down
the rebates.
