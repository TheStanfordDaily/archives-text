# VARSITY SQUAD PREPARES FOR U.C. TILT HERE
## Coach Bunn May Surprise Golden Bears With New Formations IMPROVEMENT SHOWN Schnetka, Doub Replaced By Tod, Hancock 
### Bob Wade 
Still searching for a live that will |
lake a series from the Berkeley ,
Bears for the first time since 1925,
and confident that he will have one j
whipped into shape before hostili
ties commence Saturday night, 1
Coach John Bunn last night spent !
Iho belter part of the practice ses
sion scrimmaging his regulars j
against the Grays.
With big Dave Packard back at
his pivot position, and Jack Cos- ;
grove in Cordry's place at forward,
the Indians looked almost like the j
quintet that handed the Bruins a
two-game setback. Bunn has !
evolved a lot of fancy formations \
from the data collected by Assistant !
Coach Bradshaw, who scouted the j
Bears on their recent Southern in- j
vasion, and from the old scrap book j
that has all of the Cardinals' con- ,
ference opponents systematically |
catalogued.
Packard at Center
Having Packard back at center i
revives pre-season hopes for getting
the tip-off from California's veteran ,
center, Read. According to reports j
from across the bay, Read is jump- '
ing about the way he did last yepr, |
and although campus hoop follow- I
ers probably remember only the
scintillating buckets that the elon- ;
gated sophomore tanked, the fact ,
is that Reynolds took the jump away i
from him for the better part of the !
evening.
After their showing against the
Trojans, and the continued improve- ,
ment shown this week, Edelen and
Norgard look like the class of the |
varsity guards. The former has bet- 1
tered an already strong floor game j
with a nice change of pace, and i
Norgard is fast threatening to beat i
out his former Menlo Junior College j
teammate, Frenchy LaCombe, for
accuracy with the casaba.
Injuries Take Toll
If Cosgrove gets the hang of the I
Stanford offense before the time for !
the opening whistle rolls around, he!
ought to make a nice running mate
for LaCombe. Cosgrove hasn't been
out for the team all season, but he i
has come along and shows 1
promise of returning to the form he j
showed in the Junior College con- i
ference.
With Doub and Schnetka defi- :
nitely on the sidelines for at least '
flic initial Bear contest, and ''Tiny
Tom"' Cordry still nursing his j
cracked fibula, Bunn has moved
several substitutes up to the second
string to fill in the gaps.
The one game Cordry got into
last week-end didn't help the in
jured pin a bit, and it is doubtful
if the dynamic forward will see any
action Saturday.
The Card coach is working out. a
new combination of guards in the !
Baker-Tod duo, and they shape up
as the' "powerhouse" pair of the
squad.
At forwards on the substitute five
Bunn is trying Reggie Meade and I
Chuck Glasgow, with the more ex
perienced Meade getting the call as i
understudy to Cosgrove.

COPENHAGEN, Jan. 19. I/P>—A i
giant v/hale measuring nearly 100
feet was killed in Aroe sound by a
party of Danish fishermen after a
long and exciting chase.

lake a series from the Berkeley ,
Bears for the first time since 1925,
and confident that he will have one j

ties commence Saturday night, 1
Coach John Bunn last night spent !
Iho belter part of the practice ses
sion scrimmaging his regulars j
against the Grays.
With big Dave Packard back at
his pivot position, and Jack Cos- ;
grove in Cordry's place at forward,
the Indians looked almost like the j
quintet that handed the Bruins a
two-game setback. Bunn has !
evolved a lot of fancy formations \
from the data collected by Assistant !
Coach Bradshaw, who scouted the j
Bears on their recent Southern in- j
vasion, and from the old scrap book j
that has all of the Cardinals' con- ,
ference opponents systematically |
catalogued.
Packard at Center
Having Packard back at center i
revives pre-season hopes for getting
the tip-off from California's veteran ,
center, Read. According to reports j
from across the bay, Read is jump- '
ing about the way he did last yepr, |
and although campus hoop follow- I
ers probably remember only the
scintillating buckets that the elon- ;
gated sophomore tanked, the fact ,
is that Reynolds took the jump away i
from him for the better part of the !
evening.
After their showing against the
Trojans, and the continued improve- ,
ment shown this week, Edelen and
Norgard look like the class of the |
varsity guards. The former has bet- 1
tered an already strong floor game j
with a nice change of pace, and i
Norgard is fast threatening to beat i
out his former Menlo Junior College j
teammate, Frenchy LaCombe, for
accuracy with the casaba.
Injuries Take Toll
If Cosgrove gets the hang of the I
Stanford offense before the time for !
the opening whistle rolls around, he!
ought to make a nice running mate
for LaCombe. Cosgrove hasn't been
out for the team all season, but he i
has come along and shows 1
