# EX COMMITTEE GIVES EDMONDS COUNCIL PLACE
## Appointee To Finish Colvin Term; Rally Committee Ball On April 15 
### 
Warnei Edmonds, former Men's i
Councilman, last night was appoint- j
ed by the A.S.S.U. Executive Com- j
millee to till the Council position
vacated at the end of autumn quar- !
ter by Donald L. Colvin.
Edmonds served on the Council j
during the spring of 1931. Colvin j
left Stanford at the end of last au- i
tumn quarter, but he plans to re- ;
turn for fall football.
A Council meeting tomorrow will ,
be the first of Edmonds' new term, j
which will extend to the February !
elections.
The committee pointed out that
(he calling of a freshman class elee
tion to name nine men on a fresh- ;
man honor council to work with the
Men's Council was not within the i
province either of the Men's Coun- |
cil or the Executive Committee, and j
that such a group could not be pro- 1
vided for except by a constitutional
amendment.
However, by calling the election 1
in the name of Encina Club, which
has its own constitution, the fresh- I
men can name a group of their own '
classmates to serve in an unofficial j
capacity until the February student
body election, when an amendment
allowing for a permanent group can
be passed, if it is thought necessary.
At the same meeting, Ex Com
mittee granted dates to Rally Com- '
mittee for a masque ball on April j
15, and to the Engineering Societies ]
for -m all-University dance on ;
April 29.
Brown. Miller, Coit, Carr, Cordry,
Eastman, Strout, and Hewlett were ,
present. Doub was absent.
