The versatile stars of the meet, i
however, were the four Breakers j
stalwarts and Al Blackman of the j
frosh. Blackman beat nut Jimmie
Willson to win the 100 in 10 flat; he I
won the 220 easily; and then brought I
the Encina 3E relay team up from
a poor third.to a very decisive first. 1
Fullcriwider, who is supposed to j
be a half-miler, garnered 12 l A I
points foi the day's scoring honors, j
although he did not run the 880. i
Frank won the quarter, and then I
waited till his elubmate Jim Ferric |
came up and they finished in a tie;
he nosed out Ward of the Phi Sigs j
for second in the 220; be took third
in the' 100; and he anchored the
Breakers' relay team.
Johnston Wins Weights . I
Both the shot and the discus went |
to Phil Johnston, and the large lad I
showed his versatility by also lum- 1
bering around the track in surpris- '
ingly fast time in the relay. Phil
heavod the shot 44 feet B'/i inches. I
Perhaps the best performance of i
all was turned in by Phil Morentin, '
who attempted and succeeded in the !
