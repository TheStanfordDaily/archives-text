Seven minutes to go with the
score 13-2 against them. And a
fighting, driving S.A.E. squad began
a powei thrust at this point which
stopped only when the final whistle
ended the fracas 14-14 and an over
time pei iod was called. However, in
spile of a remarkably even battle
during the extra minutes, the Gods
of the sport took their due in the
form of a technical foul awarded
the Theta Dclts when Fry of the
S.A.E. outfit spoke to a sub coming
in, and George Jensen sank the free
throw.
Minklcr Stars
"Jeff" Minklcr, Theta Delt for
ward, seemed to be all over the
place most of the time, accounting
for four of the winning baskets.
Herb Fry of the S.A.E.'s, in spite
of the slight inclination to be lo
quacious, was mainly responsible
for the delayed attack which al
most produced big results. Jack
Shidler, forward, Ray Hanson, cen
ter, and Bob Boggs, guard, put in a
lot of action in the last-minute
drive.
A chap named Johnny Kunau, ac
counting for all of its 13 points, the
Phi Delta Phi quintet was unable to
aid him even to the extent of one
point, trailing by thai margin, 14-13,
tf) the victorious Kappa Sigs when
the final whistle sounded. Lenny
Goldmann, with quite a high-school j
rep behind him, sank four baskets j
and tied with Kunau as the best j
men on the floor. The game was j
rather fast, especially during the i
last few minutes of play, although
the Kappa Sigs kept, the lead j
throughout most of the contest.
Phi Psi's Win
Al Ray and Jimmy Scott split j
honors in the Phi Psi's conquest of j
El Campo 25-1) when the latter ac
counted for 13 to Ray's 17 points I
of the Row-men's total. Harry j
Grace played a good floor game for i
the Campo five. Both squads were j
far from the best of form and until j
the last minutes were unable to find :
the basket. .
From the observer's standpoint, it
seemed that Referees Bill Fisher and
"Pop" Gabriel stood the biggest
workout of the evening. The Phi
i Kappa Sigma-Sigma Nu contest was
postponed until Thursday night at
8 o'clock in the Pavilion. Teams
were warned again yesterday against
the intercollegiate ruling against
out-of-school practice games

Seven minutes to go with the
score 13-2 against them. And a
fighting, driving S.A.E. squad began
a powei thrust at this point which
stopped only when the final whistle
ended the fracas 14-14 and an over
time pei iod was called. However, in
spile of a remarkably even battle
during the extra minutes, the Gods
of the sport took their due in the
form of a technical foul awarded
the Theta Dclts when Fry of the
S.A.E. outfit spoke to a sub coming
in, and George Jensen sank the free
throw.
Minklcr Stars
"Jeff" Minklcr, Theta Delt for
ward, seemed to be all over the
place most of the time, accounting
for four of the winning baskets.
Herb Fry of the S.A.E.'s, in spite
of the slight inclination to be lo
quacious, was mainly responsible
for the delayed attack which al
most produced big results. Jack
Shidler, forward, Ray Hanson, cen
ter, and Bob Boggs, guard, put in a
lot of action in the last-minute
drive.
A chap named Johnny Kunau, ac
counting for all of its 13 points, the
Phi Delta Phi quintet was unable to
aid him even to the extent of one
point, trailing by thai margin, 14-13,
tf) the victorious Kappa Sigs when
the final whistle sounded. Lenny
Goldmann, with quite a high-school j
rep behind him, sank four baskets j
and tied with Kunau as the best j
men on the floor. The game was j
rather fast, especially during the i
last few minutes of play, although
the Kappa Sigs kept, the lead j
throughout most of the contest.
Phi Psi's Win
Al Ray and Jimmy Scott split j
honors in the Phi Psi's conquest of j
El Campo 25-1) when the latter ac
counted for 13 to Ray's 17 points I
of the Row-men's total. Harry j
