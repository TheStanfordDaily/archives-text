# RED HEADED GIRL TAKES MAN FOR RIDE--STRIPS HIM
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 19.
($*) —110 might have given a
good account of himself with
the three men, but when the
red-headed gal started working
out on him Arthur Maker, 30,
41 Guerrero street, had to ad
mit he was outnumbered and
outclassed.
So Maker reported to police
at the Central Emergency Hos
pital early yesterday. He met
the redhead and her boy friends
at a beach resort and accepted
'tn invitation for a spin down
the Skyline boulevard.
Near Colma they removed all
his clothes, including $2.50 in
one pocket, and heaved him
out into the cold. The last he
saw of the car was the redhead
leaning out a window laugh
ing, he sai«l through clattering
teeth as he was treated for
exposure.
