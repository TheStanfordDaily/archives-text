Deep devotion to David Starr
Jordan, whom they characterized as
"a leader and friend," marked the
talks of the four speakers at the
"service of remembrance" held last
night in the Memorial Church. Yes
terday would have been the eighty
first birthday of the first President
and Chancellor-Emeritus of Stan
ford University.
Memorial wreaths were placed in
the chancellery by Leland W. Cut
ler, representing the Board of Trus
tees, Dr. Swain on behalf of the
faculty, and John F. Sheehan for
the alumni, while Robert M. Brown
performed the honor for the Asso
ciated Students.
Outstanding in Education
Dr. Douglas Houghton Campbell,
professor emeritus of botany, said
that "Dr. Jordan fast became an
outstanding factor in educational
circles in California, and it is sur
prising how soon his influence be
came strong throughout the whole
country." Dr. Campbell said that
the "enthusiasm of early Stanford
students made up for the lack of
equipment. 1 am sure that any suc
cess I may have had is due to the
help and encouragement of Dr.
Jordan."
David Starr Jordan was '"a scien
tist in search of the truth; a prophet
of democracy" in the opinion of the
Right Reverend Edward Lambe
Parsons, who was the second
speaker. "He wasÂ»a great citizen of
the stale, of the nation, and of the
world. He had a great capacity for
friendship and his friends were
limited to no race or place, but ex
tended to all parts of the globe."
Parsons Cites Motto
Dr. Jordan's favorite motto, ac
cording to the Right Reverend Par
sons, was "Above all sects is truth."
The speaker said that "He hated
war because it was destructive of
civilization and because it was
wasteful of human lives. He longed
for the ideal republic, in which jus
tice would be a reality. He was big
morally and spiritually, as he was
physically."
Leland W. Cutler, president of ihe
Board of Trustees, said "That sage
and sh'iggy head wanted the winds
of freedom to blow for youth. He
used to say, 'Lay up enthusiasm in
youth, or you will reach the end
of your journey with an empty
heart.' Jordan lived a life that made
God pioud. He so believed in youth,
that be was youth itself. That is
why I know he is God's good friend
now."
Had Pioneer Spirit
"Hiqh scholarship linked wiilt a
great pirsonafity" was the descrip
tion of Dr. Jordan by Acting Presi
dent Robert Eckles Swain. Dr.
Swain said that Jordan "rose rap
idly to eminence in university ad
ministration. Stanford can never
repay the debt it owes to thYs able
and forceful leader. Dr. Jordan had
the spirit of a pioneer and a mind
that was unafraid. Where most men
stopped, he pressed on with re
newed enthusiasm; he reached the
pinnacle of achievement attained by
few men."
The service was concluded with a
prayer by Dr. Gardner.
