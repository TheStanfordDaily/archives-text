# THE
						FIRST MISSTEP

### 
Allci' one <>1" the most presentable lii'sl periods of j
women's rushing on record during which (he slate for all
<>I' the sororities was kept remarkably clean the middle
of the second period brings the news that one or two have
started to slip.
Looked at in one way the report that some of the fresh
man women have been escor ted back to Hoble at night via i
the golf course, arriving something like an hour after the
legal time, is simply funny. So pitifully little is gained.
Hut from another angle, the thing is regrettable. Why |
need a practically spotless record of clean rushing be blot
ted especially so nearly al the end? II is a shame from
the standpoint of the separate houses, for such action is j
always the product of muddled thinking on the part ofj
one or two individuals not on the house as a whole. Hut
the responsibility belongs to the house as a whole and
Ihc slur falls upon the entire group.
At a meeting of rushing captains and house presidents!
Monday afternoon this lasl fact was pointed out. It can
hardly be 100 strongly emphasized.
There is still another reason for the situation's being
regrettable. The work which the sponsors have done at
Hoble has been more than admirable. They have effaced'
considerations of themselves and of their living group loy
alties. In the face of the line efforts of the sponsors, the
petty performance of those who are breaking the rules a
lit lie, and making il harder for both freshman and sorority, j
shows 11]> as unworthy and small.
