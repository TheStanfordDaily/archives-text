Despite Hie legal snag of unconstitutionality eiicoiin-'
tcred I>y the rreslmum class and Hie Men's (louncil in the
matter of |>]><>i111i1114 a freshman council, the efforts to
make Hie Honor ('.ode a tiling of reality reflect credit not
only 011 the freslnnen themselves, hut on the council mem-,
hers who have labored long and hard to brim* just such a 1
measure to pass.
By delegating the action to Kncina (Huh, instead of to
the freshman class in name, the interested parties can con-,
tinue their work until the February student body elections,
when the constitution can l.e amended to provide for the'
formal election of such a group.
The class of has set a splendid precedent in thus or
ganizing a freshman council th;il will work in conjunction
with the senior organization. The Men's (louncil has wisely
seen thai solution of the Honor (lode problem rests with
the incoming classes, and it is to their newly inaugurated)
prartice of explaining the (lode to the freshmen in infor-J
mal talks that this move may be attributed.
There is no reason why the new plan should not prove
successful. After all, it rests with the freshmen, and they
appear to he taking the matter seriously. A class record of
tour years without an Honor (lode violation is something
to shoot at.
