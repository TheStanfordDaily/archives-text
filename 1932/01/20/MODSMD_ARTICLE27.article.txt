# BULL SESSION
## GOOD OLD HATTIE! 
### 
Whon Senator Caraway passed on |
to his h;.ppy hunting grounds where!
Democrats always win the elections
I —and cx-Republican Presidents act j
j as Senate page boys, the Governor j
i of Arkansas appointed his widow to :
1 hold office until a special election J
should be held. People laughed and '
considerde it a sentimental gesture to j
the memory of the dead man. But j
their laughter turned to tears,,when
I in the election recently held Hattie [
! Caraway polled about 13 times mote i
! votes than her combined opposition;
i and became* the first woman's U.S.
; Senator ever to be elected.
There are many disadvantages to ,
j having women hold public office but |
I the major one is that it becomes 1
| difficult to criticize them. In this |
| country you can accuse the Presi- j
dent of "abysmal ignorance, ' and !
all you get is publicity. But let a j
j man suggest that, a female member ,
of the local Board of Education has
made a mistake, and immediately he <
becomes a cad, an insulting mon- |
ster, arid a masculine despot. Petti- ;
coats may be out of style, but figur- !
atively speaking, their fragile lex- j
ture offers an impregnable barrier
to criticism. But further still, a i
j woman-in-politics feels especially |
privileged to lash her male oppon- I
i ents without mercy.
But Mrs. Hattie Caraway, per- :
1 haps, will compensate in other ways ;
j for the disadvantages of her sex in |

politics. In her first public utterance
she has risen to some startling eco
nomic and philosophical heights.
"In the first place," says the new
Senator Caraway, "if you don't
have it to .spend, you can't spend it."
Now, that's sound policy; and good
advice, too. It's a fact that one
wouldn''. buy a car and pay for it
il he didn't have anything to pay
for it with? Good old Hattie!
She continues, "I can't see any
benefits to be derived from trying
to spend what you don't iVive." This
is a natural and logical corrallary
of the first statement. If you can't
spend what you don't have, obvi
ously no benefits can be derived
from trying to do the impossible.
There is some real philosophy. Don't
be frustrated in your life's work by
t lying to accomplish that which
cannot be done. Good old Hattie!
And then, in referring to some
economic measures passed by Con
gress, tiie Senator stated, "Nobody
can tell what effect these bills will
have, but we can hope for the best."
That's true. Always look at the rosy
side of life. See the silver lining in
every cloud; and don't bite it to see
if the silver is genuine. Good old
Hattie!
Kipling was right. The female is
the "fiercer" of the species. And in
more respects than the British poet
hiid in mind. —Abe Mellinkoff

There are many disadvantages to ,
j having women hold public office but |
I the major one is that it becomes 1
| difficult to criticize them. In this |
| country you can accuse the Presi- j
dent of "abysmal ignorance, ' and !
all you get is publicity. But let a j
j man suggest that, a female member ,
of the local Board of Education has
made a mistake, and immediately he <
becomes a cad, an insulting mon- |
ster, arid a masculine despot. Petti- ;
coats may be out of style, but figur- !
atively speaking, their fragile lex- j
ture offers an impregnable barrier
to criticism. But further still, a i
j woman-in-politics feels especially |
privileged to lash her male oppon- I
i ents without mercy.
But Mrs. Hattie Caraway, per- :
1 haps, will compensate in other ways ;
j for the disadvantages of her sex in |

politics. In her first public utterance
she has risen to some startling eco
nomic and philosophical heights.
"In the first place," says the new
Senator Caraway, "if you don't
have it to .spend, you can't spend it."
Now, that's sound policy; and good
advice, too. It's a fact that one
wouldn''. buy a car and pay for it
il he didn't have anything to pay
for it with? Good old Hattie!
She continues, "I can't see any
benefits to be derived from trying
to spend what you don't iVive." This
is a natural and logical corrallary
of the first statement. If you can't
spend what you don't have, obvi
ously no benefits can be derived
from trying to do the impossible.
There is some real philosophy. Don't
be frustrated in your life's work by
t lying to accomplish that which
cannot be done. Good old Hattie!
And then, in referring to some
economic measures passed by Con
gress, tiie Senator stated, "Nobody
can tell what effect these bills will
have, but we can hope for the best."
That's true. Always look at the rosy
side of life. See the silver lining in
every cloud; and don't bite it to see
if the silver is genuine. Good old
Hattie!
Kipling was right. The female is
the "fiercer" of the species. And in
more respects than the British poet
hiid in mind. —Abe Mellinkoff
Whon Senator Caraway passed on |
to his h;.ppy hunting grounds where!
Democrats always win the elections
I —and cx-Republican Presidents act j
j as Senate page boys, the Governor j
i of Arkansas appointed his widow to :
1 hold office until a special election J
should be held. People laughed and '
considerde it a sentimental gesture to j
the memory of the dead man. But j
their laughter turned to tears,,when
I in the election recently held Hattie [
! Caraway polled about 13 times mote i
! votes than her combined opposition;
i and became* the first woman's U.S.
