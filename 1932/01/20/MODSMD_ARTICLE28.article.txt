1. In the beginning The Powers,
created Stanford University and
Palo A ho.
2. And Stanford University was;
withoyt form, and void; no build- j
. ings were there upon the face of
the meadows. And The Powers
j moved with difficulty upon the face :
; of the waters, which were Lagunita. j
And The Powers said, Let there j
be a Quadrangle: and there was a
Quadrangle.
4. And The Powers saw the Quad- ;
rangle, that it was good: and The
. Powers divided the Quadrangle
from the living groups.
5. And The Powers called one
living group Encina, and the other
they called The liastille.
! 6. Then The Powers said, .Let
I there also be a Row in the midst '
of the meadows, and let it divide
; the Greeks from the Commoners,
j 7. And The Powers made the Stow
j and divided the sheep who were
| above the median from the indi
vidualists who were lie low the me
dian, and it was so.
8. And The Powers called the Row j
Lasuen, which is Freshman Heaven. |
9. Arid The Powers said, At tne :
j appointed time, let the young sheep
j of the Bastille be gathered together
in ;i group with the inhabitants of,
| this Heaven, and let the Greeks
i among them be filtered out and the |
others left to travel in their own
paths. And it was so.
10. Then The Greeks brought
forth pledge pins, and dressed the
young sheep according to their es
tablished will and custom, even
shearing the lock- of their young
sheep, that they might lie all alike,
that no man might doubt their
identity with the clan of Appak, or
flip Ateb, or Ammag; and they
thought that it was good.
11. Then The Powers said, Let
there be* Lights in Stanford Univer-

I sity, who shall stand out alone and
i mark the difference between Play j
! and Study, that all men may see j
I them as leaders.
I |
12. And The Powers created only j
j a few Great Lights, yea, a Scanty j
Few Lights among Ihe Women, and 1
they were all individualists, and i
1 had travelled Iheir own way, and
!so lived not on Lasuen, which is j
Freshman Heaven, but in The Bas
! title. And these were truly great, ;
j and shone upon the face of the |
earth.
13. Bui the Greeks, too, were
happy in their way, and many were
the laurels and bounteous things of ,
the earth which Time bestowed
I upon them.
i 14. And each group was joysome,
and made merry according to its j
i own liking and wont. And verily the i
individualists of the Bastille coun- j
try found joys equal to those of the j
Greeks; and only a few were un- ]
happ.v because of yearning for a j
pledge button and a Secret Motto. •
15. And time went on, and each
j year there was a gathering of the j
[ inhabitants of Lasuen, which is
Freshman Heaven, for the selection
of the sheep from individualists, |
and much was made of it. And each
t year, verily, there were loud wail- j
i ings and moanings from the Indi- !
vldualists who had wanted to be I
Sheep, and also some moanings,
though very quiet ones, from Sheep \
who soon longed for the freedom of
the Bastille.
16. And 10, The Powers found that ;
the gathering and separation were :
! not good, but Custom was Custom.
And the Greeks and the Bastillians i
I found if good, each after a different '
fashion, though the Young Sheep
were too dazed and credulous to be |
sure what they thought most good I
until it was too late.
