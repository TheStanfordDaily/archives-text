SWISS FAMILY MANHATTAN—, \

Now isn't this, for instance, de
[ lightfui: r
"'Now, boys,' I said, 'I do not wish f
to begin our anticipated little hoii- 1
i day by finding fault, but do you <
i think it was courteous—to say i
nothing of its effect on your health !
—to finish the wine in your father's 1
I absence?' i
"Fritz—'But, Papa, wo thought, I
i alpha, that you were not coming \
i back; and beta, that the glasses i
j would spill and it would be wasted.' t
"'And gamma, we liked it,' critd (
I Otto in his most impudent manner,
i 'It makes our knees go twitter.'" (
I This Jefl the father, a sedate Swiss (
i clerk at the Society of Nations, |
Geneva, aghast. He was taking his ' i

wife and two sons with him on an
educational dirigible tour of Europe
and America while he finished his
book, ' History (if Human Reason."
The Swiss family gets its first
amazing impressions of America
from :he uppermost girders of the
Empire State Building where they
are stranded during a storm. JThe
horror of the serious-minded conti
nentals is soort spent, however. We
hear the clerk exclaiming: "O God,
in the rotation Of Thy will spare
these blessed pagans nor taint them
with the malady of thought. Never,
never, civilize them and so destroy
their charm!"
The only fault we have to find
with this light, appreciative satire
on American culture and European
cultural dry rot is that it is so short
— which is really a merit since sa
tire is usually overdone. —E.T.P.
