THE RETURN of Ernie Nevers to
the Farm brings to mind many ,
yarns concerning the blond giant's !
career at Stanford.
"Tiny" Thornhill, varsity line
coach, shed a feto tears yesterday i
over that*ill-fated Rose Bowl game |
with Notre Dame on New Year's
Day in 1925. Nevers had been han
dicapped all season by injuries, and j
was even kept on the sidelines dur
ing that most famous of all Big
Games, the 24-to-24 tie.
lint by New Year's tliey had
him patched up—all except a
little matter of two broken
ankles. He couldn't walk. So
tlie.v wrapped a couple of miles
of adhesive tape around the
shattered members and let him
take a crack at the late Knute
Ilockne's undefeated Ramblers.
He not only took a crack at 'em, ,
but pushed 'em all over the field.
Playing his first full game of the j
season, and on those broken ankles, I
he still managed to star for Stan
ford. The Warner machine rolled
up 178 yards by rushing to 130 by
Notre Dame, and Nevers supplied j
most of the power.
Even in passing, forte of the
Ramblers, the Cards excelled, mak
ing 138 yards in that department to
56 by the Rockne crew—and blond
Ernie was on the propelling end of
many the passes completed.
But. withall, the Four Horse
men and Seven Mules were
triumphant. A couple of inter
cepted passes run back for
touchdowns, a fumble on the
goal line, and a successful stand
by the Irish on the four-inch
line gave the South Bend eleven
a national championship.
ANOTHER OCCASION when the j
big fellow put up a fruitless battle |
in spite of injuries was in his
sophomore year, when he starred
in the Big Game with a few broken j
ribs swathed in tape.
California, taking advantage of
the breaks, captured a 9 to 0 game,
on a safety and blocked punt. But |
consider what Nevers did—carry- !
ing the ball 17 times, he gained 86 1
of the 118 yards Stanford gained
from scrimmage.
Getting away for a 20-yard
dash through tackle, Ernie put j
the ball in scoring position just
before the end of the half. Had
time permitted, he was certain
to have battered his way to the
goal, but the Cards had to take
to the air in a futile effort to
reach the end zone.
Nevevs finally defeated the in
jury spectre in 1925, his most fa- j
mous season, but two of his greatest i
games were played with broken j
bones held in place by sticky tape, i
