## 
### 
Ushering in the series of four j
water polo contests to determine
the interclass champions for 1932,
the sophomore goal-shooters will
take on the freshman outfit this
afternoon at 4:30 o'clock in the En- j
cina pool.
Still slightly favored over the
youngsters, the second-year men
are expected to have no easy time
of it when they face the smooth- j
working Babe seven which, al- i
1 hough it has no individual stars, I
is likely to click as far as teamwork j
is concerned. The yearlings are ex- j
pccted to take advantage of their
previous experience together so far
this season, the sophomores not ;
having operated as a team since j
last year.
Following today's contest, the j
seniors will meet the juniors to- j
morrow, and the winner of this en- j
counter will tackle the victor in
today's game to decide the inter- j
class championship. This, and the ;
game to determine third place will j
be held Saturday afternoon along j
with two other features, one of ex
traordinary interest, to be an
nounced tomorrow. The proceeds,
