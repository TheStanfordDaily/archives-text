# FOURTH MINERAL IN RARE MARIPOSA ORE STUMPS PROFESSOR
## 
### 
An entirely new mineral com- |
bination, identified by Austin Flint |
Rogers, Professor of Mineralogy j
here, as barium silicate has recently j
been discovered in a Mariposa rock '
specimen |
Professor Rogers has named the I
new mineral Sanbornite, in honor j
of Professor Fred S. Sanborn, min- I
eralogist for the California . State!
Bureau of Mines. The rock is also j
said to contain a red mineral known
as gillespite, assertedly found only j
once before in North America; a i
small quantity of celsian and traces j
of a fourth mineral believed to be |
of a new and as yet unidentified j
variety.
Barium silicate, of which the new !
mineral, Sanbornite, is composed, is j
a combination which has never been !
found together before in natural ;
form. It has been produced in the
laboratory, however.
Professor Rogers is planning to |
visit the Mariposa county district ]
to make further studies of the new j
mineral and also with a view to |
identifying the fourth substance
contained in the rock specimens.
