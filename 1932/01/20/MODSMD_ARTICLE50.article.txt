# Card-U. C. Frosh Gird For Battle
## SPEEDY RESERVES WIN FROM FROSH REGULAR QUINTET California Frosh Pile Up Large Score In Game With St. Ignatius 
### Albert Guerard 
Shifts in the lineup of the Stan
ford frosh cagers may be expected
because of the workout Monday
night when an unmerciful toma
hawking was administered to the
regular Redskin five by a fast
breaking second quintet composed
of Kelly, center, Page and Coiner,
forwards, Crowe and Savage, guards.
The Indian "regulars," with Tom
Sales at center, Lawry Rothert and
Frank Cox, forwards, and Joe Butte
and Gordon Mallatratt, guards,
seemed sadly off form, while the
play of the second five was of a
better brand than that team has
shown all season.
Competition Strong
The showing of Tom Kelly at
center is likely to earn him the
starting position against the Bear
Cubs on Saturday, while Coiner,
whose last-minute shot against
Stockton Saturday, brought the
Papooses their first victory of the
season, now appears to be a stand
off with Frank Cox for one of the
forward positions.
The showing of Wally Crowe and
Jim Savage at guard is very en
couraging, because to date Mallat
ratt and Butte have had to shoulder
all responsibility for the guard
work. While there is no question as
to the value of Fawcett's two first
string guards, their work in the
scrimmage was certainly no more
than equal to that of Crowe and
Savage. Crowe is a made-over for
ward, while Savage's height is par
ticularly valuable in getting the
ball off the backboard.
Fresno Here Friday
Friday night's game with Fresno
High is likely to prove a tough hur
dle, but it is probable that several
of the most valuable men on the
yearling team will see little action,
resting up for Saturday night's tus
sle. The Fresnans rank next to the
Stockton Tarzans among interior
high-school teams, but are easily
the leaders in the Central California
section. Friday night's contest is the
only one on the bill, but the Bear
Club battle on Saturday will serve
as a preliminary attraction to the
Stanford-California varsity struggle.
The California freshmen, who
meet Coach Vance Fawcett's In
dian yearlings in the first install
ment of the Little Big Series Sat
urday night, broke into the win
column Monday night for the first
time in four starts, when they de
feated St. Ignatius High, 21-11, at
Berkeley.
