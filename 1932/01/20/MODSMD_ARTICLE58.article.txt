# FIGHT MEDALS MAY BE GIVEN BY GOV. ROLPH
## Maloney Invites Sunny Jim To Witness Stanford Championships 
### 
Governor James Rolph, Jr., has
been invited to attend the All-Uni
versity Boxing Tournament, to be
held here February 4, by Harry Ma
loney, head boxing coach. The gov
ernor has been asked to present the
gold medals to be awarded the win
ners in the various divisions.
Though no word has been re
ceived from Rolph, Maloney ex
presses himself as confident that
the governor will be here.
A few of last year's boxers and
many new men are rapidly round- i
ing into shape for the championship
matches. Maloney is looking to these
matches to give him a line on ma
terial for his varsity squad.
In the heavyweight division Phil
Smith and Ben Palamountain are
the outstanding candidates. Smith
is in fine early season form and |
should have no trouble in taking
other unlimited boxers into camp.
Palamountain, who will probably
meet Smith in the finals, has the
makings of a good fighter but is
noticeably in poor condition.
