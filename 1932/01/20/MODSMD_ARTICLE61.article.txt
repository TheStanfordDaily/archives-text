### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19. </P) â€” !
Once the world's fastest human, j
Charley Paddock, who had been in |
training for the past several months j
in hopes of staging a comeback by
landing a place on the American 1
Olympics team, found himself [
barred from amateur competition |
today.
The local branch of the Amateur i
Athletic Union last night voted to 1
deny the famous sprinter an ama- |
teur card, this automatically bar- 1
ring hiin from competition.
A week previous to last night's :
meeting the A.A.U. registration |
committee had investigated Pad
dock's participation in athletic mo- j
lion pictures and for which he was j
reported to have been paid a large 1
amount.
"We have refused Charley Pad- j
dock a registration card," said Ar- 1
nold Eddy, secretary of the A.A.U. I
registration committee. He would;
not amplify the statement.
Paddock today said he did not j
know what action he would take, j
if any.
"I have nothing to say at this '
time other than this, that I have i
been cleared of the motion picture |
charge," he stated. "The real rea- j
son why I am being barred is be
cause I have embarrassed the;
A.A.U.. they say."
