### 
Frederick Bradley, president of
i the Alaska June;iu Mining Company
i and former president of the Ameri
! can Mining and Metallurgical En
-1 gineers Association, was the speaker
| at the first weekly meeting of the
j Graduate School of Business held
; in the Union dining room.
Bradley explained various phases
connected with the mining of gold,
| including the sea level tunnel
| method of ore mining, average as
] say of mineral mined, type of labor
j employed, and difficulties encoun
' tered in shaft-sinking. The problem
jof financing the company in its
j early days was also discussed.
Heavy snowfall and consequent
1 inundation of a newly begun mine
| was one of the early discourage
| ments of the company. The apparent
moral of this disaster forced the
j recognition of native mining prin
| ciples and methods.
In a round-table discussion fol
| lowing the main lecture, the nature
j of the questions was purely teehni
! cal, involving to a considerable
1 extent the amount, use, and value
of by-products obtained from gold
bearing ore. Most of the machinery
used in the mines, Bradley stated,
' is driven by electrical or air-com
] pressed power.
The. speaker of the evening was
introduced by Donald Patterson,
\ cha inn in of the Graduate Business
meetings.
