With the three other contests be- .
ing more or less walkaways for the ;
victorious quintets, El Capitan's 22- j
10 defeat of Kappa Alpha was the
closest of the mural hoop contests !
last evening. Ending a rather close j
and interesting first period with the |
score 8-4 at half time, the Clubmen
managed to raise 14 points to K.A.':>
three baskets during the final min
utes of play.
Bob Quinn and George Stump, |
forwards, led the Capitan , attack,
scoring 8 points each. Roland Davis, :
a fairly active center, was respons
ible for 4 of the 10 digits accumu
lated by the Row-men. The game, i
though smoothing itself out in spots,
was marked by an obvious need of
fioorwork for both squads.
Thcta Chi Wins
In a 32-10 fracas, a promising j
Thcta Chi outfit handed out a thor
ough trouncing to a game but sloppy
El Cuadro quintet. In spite of ac- 1
curate shooting by both teams, the
Cuadro men lost out on poor floor j
work and an obvious need of sys- j
tcm. George Griffin-took 16 of the j
winning points to lead the Row
men in scoring, while Ed Saunders !
was outstanding for Cuadro with 4
digits.
Another massacre, literally speak- i
ing, took place in the Menlo Hash- }
ors' 31-9 basket-fest with the Chi
nese Club. In spite of some really j
good shooting in spots, the Clulv
was doomed from the outset mainly
because of the size of its players.
The Hashers, on the average, were i
about a head taller than their op
ponents, man for man. It was a !
ragged affair, however, though the |
victors showed potential strength.
McGarr Stars
Art McGarr starred for the Hash
ers and Stan Moy and Ruhland
Isaly were outstanding on the op- i
posing quintet. In that order they !
accounted for 6, 5, and 7 points, |
respectively.
Closing the first period leading a ;
figliting Breakers quintet 11-5, the j
Delta Chi outfit went back a few |
minutes later to be almost overtaken !
when the Club raised the ante to |
11-9. However, the best the latter)
could do after this was to be satis- I
fied with a 29-13 defeat.
Brown, Paxton Good
Delmer Brown and Dick Paxton J
playqd a good game for the victors, |
managing to roll up 11 and 8 points |
while playing forward and center i
positions, respectively. Pete Holmes j
and Carl Rccknagel of the Club
were high-point mfcn with 3 digits j
each. In spite of an interesting i
game, the first half was extremely j
slow and showed the need common
to most of the competitors—prac- j
tice.
Referees Buster Holmes and
"Pop" Gabriel seemed to get the !
biggest workout of all the partici- :
pants irt both games. Last week's i
fault of missing set-ups in large j
numbers has been eliminated, but '■
the trouble has now been centered j
in fioorwork. Very few of the squads j
seen in action thus far have shown j
any teamwork to speak of.
The Phi Kappa Sigma-Sigma Nu i
contest, scheduled for tonight, has
been postponed indefinitely.
