# CINDER SQUADS LOSE HURDLER, TWO JUMPERS
## Stallings Out; Ineligibilities Lop Lamont, Lapidus From Rosters 
### Dick Strouse 
Injuries and ineligibilities com- j
bined to deal a serious blow to both j
Stanford's varsity and freshman !
track hopes yesterday afternoon.
Dean Stallings, of whom much was I
hoped m the varsity hurdle races,
was operated on for appendicitis,
while Lament and Lapidus of the
freshmen wore found to have at
tended universities other than Stan
ford.
Stallings went to the lfospital i
Tuesday afternoon, and although he :
underwent an operation for appen- i
dipitis, his appendix turned out to 1
lie healthy. Dr. Fritz Roth, be
lieves, however, that the cause of j
Stallings' internal discomfort was
found and remedied during the I
operation.
Hurdles Need Balance
Even if Stallings recovers com- j
pletely, it is doubtful if he will run
much this year. This leaves Cotto
Herbert, Jack Brugman, Dave Pack
ard, and Gus Meier to bear the
hurdle burden. Herbert in the lows I
and Brugman in the highs should ;
be able to hold their own in the |
best of company, but Stallings would ,
have added some needed balance.
The case of Lamont and Lapidus
is strange. Each came to Stanford |
thinking he was eligible for fresh- j
man track. But it has turned out j
that Lamont went to the University]
of Washington for a quarter, while !
Lapidus attended U.C.L.A. for a
similar period of time. Under* ihe !
rules of the Pacific Coast Confer- j
encc, both men cannot run as fresh- [
men, and both lose a year of varsity |
competition.
Kothert Chooses Hoop
Lapidus was the outstanding
freshman broad-jumper, and has a i
hi"h-school rccord of nearly 22 feet. \
Lamont, who entered Stanford this j
j quarter, is a high-jumper who has :
| cleared five feet eleven inches.
| The Class of '35's track team has ;
j lost, temporarily at least, three other .
I valuable men. Lawrie Rothert is
I now cavorting around the basket- j
! ball court, but will probably add '
| his pole-vaulting skill to the track
| squad when the cage season closes.
Bob Boyd, who has looked promis
ing in the 440 so far this year, has
forsaken the old oval for the hand
some new sunken diamond and is j
now out for baseball. Marvie Kahn, j
i of whom much was expected in the !
! 880, has yet to make his appearance.
Flanagan Reports
Atoning, in part at least, for Ihe
j loss of Lapidus is the news that
Pop Flanagan has appeared on the
track, and that he possesses much
broad-jumping ability. Flanagan,!
when in high school several years j
ago, is supposed to have jumped a ;
prodigious distance. He has gotten j
heavier since that time, and Coach I
] Bill Ellington may use him in the |
j weights.
The intramural track meet re
vealed one encouraging feature of
the frosh track team in the person
of a half-rnilcr named Harris. Un
heralded and unsung, Harris ran a
good race to beat out Charlie dc-
Brettcville of the varsity by at least
three inches for third place. Harris
gives promise of adding strength to
one of the weakest of the events
on Ihe freshman team.

Lapidus attended U.C.L.A. for a
similar period of time. Under* ihe !
rules of the Pacific Coast Confer- j
encc, both men cannot run as fresh- [
men, and both lose a year of varsity |
competition.
Kothert Chooses Hoop
Lapidus was the outstanding
freshman broad-jumper, and has a i
hi"h-school rccord of nearly 22 feet. \
Lamont, who entered Stanford this j
j quarter, is a high-jumper who has :
| cleared five feet eleven inches.
| The Class of '35's track team has ;
j lost, temporarily at least, three other .
I valuable men. Lawrie Rothert is
I now cavorting around the basket- j
! ball court, but will probably add '
| his pole-vaulting skill to the track
| squad when the cage season closes.
Bob Boyd, who has looked promis
ing in the 440 so far this year, has
forsaken the old oval for the hand
some new sunken diamond and is j
now out for baseball. Marvie Kahn, j
i of whom much was expected in the !
! 880, has yet to make his appearance.
Flanagan Reports
Atoning, in part at least, for Ihe
j loss of Lapidus is the news that
Pop Flanagan has appeared on the
track, and that he possesses much
broad-jumping ability. Flanagan,!
when in high school several years j
ago, is supposed to have jumped a ;
prodigious distance. He has gotten j
heavier since that time, and Coach I
] Bill Ellington may use him in the |
j weights.
The intramural track meet re
vealed one encouraging feature of
the frosh track team in the person
of a half-rnilcr named Harris. Un
heralded and unsung, Harris ran a
good race to beat out Charlie dc-
Brettcville of the varsity by at least
three inches for third place. Harris
gives promise of adding strength to
one of the weakest of the events
on Ihe freshman team.

Injuries and ineligibilities com- j
bined to deal a serious blow to both j
Stanford's varsity and freshman !
track hopes yesterday afternoon.
Dean Stallings, of whom much was I
hoped m the varsity hurdle races,
was operated on for appendicitis,
while Lament and Lapidus of the
freshmen wore found to have at
tended universities other than Stan
ford.
Stallings went to the lfospital i
Tuesday afternoon, and although he :
underwent an operation for appen- i
dipitis, his appendix turned out to 1
lie healthy. Dr. Fritz Roth, be
lieves, however, that the cause of j
Stallings' internal discomfort was
found and remedied during the I
operation.
Hurdles Need Balance
Even if Stallings recovers com- j
pletely, it is doubtful if he will run
much this year. This leaves Cotto
Herbert, Jack Brugman, Dave Pack
ard, and Gus Meier to bear the
hurdle burden. Herbert in the lows I
and Brugman in the highs should ;
be able to hold their own in the |
best of company, but Stallings would ,
have added some needed balance.
The case of Lamont and Lapidus
is strange. Each came to Stanford |
thinking he was eligible for fresh- j
man track. But it has turned out j
that Lamont went to the University]
of Washington for a quarter, while !
Lapidus attended U.C.L.A. for a
