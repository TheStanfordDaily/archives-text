# Ernie Nevers, Hero Of Stanford Saga, Returns
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Football sweater Number One is
missing forever from the Stanford
bench—but its owner came back to
(ho campus yesterday.
Ernie Nevers, blond Saxon who
brought the conquering team of
1925 to a West Coast grid cham
pionship, and wound up that mem
orable season in the East-West
game—a good fullback running on
Iwo broken ankles, for Stanford.
Coach "Pop" Warner, who guided
Captain Ernie in those halcyon
days, looked on as a mere spec
tator yesterday, muffled in top-coat
against the bitter wind while Nevers
pitted his National Collegiatcs
against the padded dummy-posts of
the practice field, working to meet
Frank Carideo's All-Stars in a
charity game Sunday.
Cur*-voiced, taut, hair tousled,
imd brow dripping with sweat,
Miuizinyiy fast on the field, Nevers

J shows the brains of the outfit. His
j punts, incredible, arched bullet
| flights, are almost like poetry. His
faded icd jersey, plunging through
| the lino, still flashes a hint of the
! heroic, though Stanford's honor has
j been replaced by the drab business
of something to do.
I OfT the field, a low voice, firm
j like the lines of his jaw and brow,
i deep-set eyes, blue-gray with
J amusement, plus a friendly courtesy,
; distinguish this Nevers, Stanford's
I Beowulf.
His Block S sweater he wears "in
the summers, up the river, fishing."
He likvj to come back to Stanford—
"And I was glad to find the lake
full." History—Far East and Me
i diev.il—were his best courses, and
j study hours he put in at the Libe.
j No, he used to draw no line be*-
' twecn Row and Roble. "They're all
1 women, aren't they?"
