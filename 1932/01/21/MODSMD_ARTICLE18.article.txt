# Farm Professor Relates Einstein Trip Anecdotes
## Cooper Meets Scientist On Board Atlantic Ship 
### J. H. Graves, Jr 
As a man, Einstein isn't shy, he's
just pestered, so says William Alpha
Cooper, Professor of German at
Stanford, who became well ac
quainted with Ihe great scientist
while aboard ship returning from
Europe recently.
Cooper described Einstein as a
man of retiring character. "It is my
guess that he would be much hap
pier if he were left alone entirely,"
he said, when referring to the con
stant interviews to which Einstein
is subjected by reporters.
Einstein Seeks Quiet
"Einstein does not court, pub
licity," Cooper went on. "He tried
to come to America incognito. In
stead of embarking at Hamburg or
Bremen he slipped aboard quietly
while our ship was loading at An
twerp.
"But by the time we reached the
Canal the entire world knew he
was on board. At every landing
place delegations met him."
Einstein's fame has even pene
trated the jungles. Cooper relates
one incident in particular which oc
curred on a short excursion along
the coast of South America. Several
score natives — illiterate, naked
tribesmen —stopped and stared at
the scientist as he passed.
The educator ridiculed the popu
lar idea that Einstein's relativity
theory is understood by only two
or three men in America.
Many Understand Theory
"The theory when originally pub
lished called for certain mathemati
cal knowledge not generally pos
sessed, even by physicists," he main
tains. "But they lost no time in
acquiring it. Today there are many
scholars and scientists in our coun
try who understand this theory."
Professor Cooper believes that
Einstein is not an ordinary man. His
habits are different from those of
the ordinary scientist.
"He works on difficult problems
with only brief intervals of rest. His
specially is physical theory, yet he
speaks fluently on any subject. Our
conversation dealt mostly with sci
entific subjects and university prob
lems. We compared American and
German university systems."
