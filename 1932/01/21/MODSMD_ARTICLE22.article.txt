Jan. 20. (/Pj—Two persons were killed and many injured
today in a clash between a gang of Japanese and members of the
Chinese and International Settlement police forces. The light, apparently
growing out of the lYfanchurian trouble and the Chinese boycott on
Japanese goods, added to the tenseness of the relations between Shanghai's
Japanese and Chinese populations.
One killed was Chinese, the other Japanese. Investigations were started
by the Foreign Settlement authorities and tht} Japanasc consulate. Rum
blings of unrest came from the large Japanese colony.

Tokyo prepared for the dissolu
tion of the Diet at tomorrow's open
ing session. A call for a general elec
tion was expected, made necessary
by the fact that Premier Inukai, in
power only about a month, has a
minority backing in the parliament.
League of Nations officials, com
menting on reports that China in
tended to invoke against Japan the
League Covenant provisions for eco
nomic boycott and military action,
said technicalities would prevent
any such action.
