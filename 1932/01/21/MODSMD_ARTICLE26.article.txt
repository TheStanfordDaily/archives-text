# HOOP CHANCES SHOT BY CARD HOSPITAL LIST
## "Reggie" Meade Added To Squad's Long List Of Sick And Injured NO LINEUP ANNOUNCED Cardinals Are Now Weaker Than Against Trojans 
### Dick Rodda 
With "Tiny Tom" Cordry definite
ly unavailable to Stanford's cage
five for the Big Game here Satur
day, the name of "Reggie" Meade*
was yesterday added to the squad's
long list of sick and injured.
Meade has been suffering from
sinus trouble and was not out to
practice last night. Whether or not
I he can be used against the Bears
| will be decided today by the team
| physician, Dr. Fritz Roth.
Many Out
With Bill Doub, center, and Bill
[ Schnelka, guard, also definitely out
I of the fray, the Indians will prob
! ably face the Bears in an even
I poorer physical shape than they wt re
against the Trojans last week. Doub
j has failed to recover from a thigh
injury, while Schnetka is still laid
up in the hospital with a severe
J cold.
As bad as the situation would ap-
I pear, Coach John Bunn is not
l worrying. Jack Cosgrove is beinu
| groomed to take Meade's place at
I forward to work with "Frenchy"
] LaCombe, his former teammate at
! Menlo J.C. Although the loss of
j Cordry, Doub, and Schnetka is
| keenly felt, Bunn solved this prob-
I lem last week by using Edeleri at
guard and Hancock and Jenkins as
substitute centers.
Lineup Unknown
As Meade's condition is still in
j definite, Bunn was unable to an
i nounce a starting lineup for the
'Cards. Only two were mentioned as
i certain to be on the floor at the
j opening whistle. They were Norgard
j and LaCombe.
The position of center is still un
der question but Packard will prob
i ably get the call, since the Bears
! are the tallest team in the southern
j division. John Hancock, v/ho mixed
it up well in the Trojan encounters,
' will undoubtedly see action in the
I pivot position before the night is
j over. The starter at guard opposite
Norgard will be either Edelen or
: Baker.
Hard Scrimmage
I Bunn has been working his men
â–  in tough scrimmages this week in
| the hopes of upsetting the Bears
this year for the first time since
1925. The California squad, with
Kintana, Read, EifTert, Ohashi, and
Vendt, has failed to find its'stride
this season, except possibly in the
first game of the U.C.L.A. series
last week. If they get going Satur
day, Stanford will probably find
itself up against a tougher outfit
j than the Terrible Trojans.
