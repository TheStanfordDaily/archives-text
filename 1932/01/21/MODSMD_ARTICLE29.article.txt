In ;im adjoining Campus Opinion column, (1. R. Vail
voices disapproval <>' Uu* Daily's use of cigarette ads, and
lor thiil matter, advertising in general. If the advertisers
are getting dollar for dollar what they put into the Daily,
Vail contends, then the students themselves are paying the
advertisers. Well, thai is the principle on which the Daily
solicits advertising and the principle on which the adver
tisers give the Daily their business.
Vail, however, suggests that the Daily give more atten
tion to improving its news column, take no advertising
whatsoever, and let the students he assessed the difference
thai advertising brings in.
Perhaps Vail does not realize just how much the plan
he suggests would cost each student. Advertising brings in
between $15,000 and #20,000 yearly to the Daily, and it
costs the Daily less to set up most ads than it would to set
up a corresponding amount of news type. If ads were done
away with, the cost of putting out the paper would mount
some 25 per cent, adding another #6,000 or #7,0(H) to the
amount the students would pay under Vail's plan. To sup
port the paper in that manner, each student would have to
pay about #11 a school year, where he now pays #1.80 that
comes out of the A.S.S.I 1 , fee.
Furthermore, the plan would work an injustice to those
Palo Alto merchants who depend upon Stanford students
for it great deal of their trade legitimate enterprises that
are deserving of student support. The Daily would gain
only in having a fixed income, and the students and trades
people of Palo Alto would lose. So the Campus Opinion
writer's plan is hardly feasible.
