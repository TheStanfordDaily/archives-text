# BULL SESSION
## ANY SOAP, GUNGA DIN? 
### 
Ther<? is something decidedly in
j congruous in talking about ideals
and national politics one day and
| the next day be forced to speak of
I something so mundane, so tame, so
j lacking in glamour and heart-appeal
I as soap—not perfumed soap—not
i imported soap—just ordinary every
! day soap. We at Stanford are much
| more fortunate than the poor Eng
lish soldier who cried out for water;
j we have water. That is something.
I But that trusty carrier with his
! goat-skin water bag must have had
f a bit ot soap tucked in his loin
i cloth. And so we cry out for soap,
| SOAP, Gunga Din.
| In the men's washroom at the Li-
I brary, we cheerfully give up hot
I water and remain silent with but a
! single cold faucet. Wo realize that
t hot water is a great luxury—one of
! the finer things of life—and so we
bear our lot with patience and forti
, ture. Encina has hardened most of
! us to the absence of hot water. But
' soap is different. Even amid the rug
| gedness of Encina days, we always
j managed to use soap. Of course, we
may be somewhat aristocratic; and
! maybe we were putting on airs by
| presuming to use this little aid to
! cleanliness, but anyway, we ac
: quired the habit. Like nicotine, we

i can't break it.
After getting our hands all inky
I from taking notes on such inspiring
j works as Plato's Republic, English
lyrics, etc., we come downstairs and
reach for the soap—despite the fact
I that it has been missing for months,
j In a llash, all the milk and honey
; of human kindness is gone; all the
] glorious ideals and noble thoughts
| vanish. Our field of consciousness is
j crowded with but one idea—a four
| letter idea—SOAP. At once there
! loom up visions of cleanliness v/eek
| —health slogans of high-school days,
"A Bar of Soap a Day Will Keep
| Old Man Dil i Away"—or some such
■ thing.
Last quarter the room in ques
i tion lacked a mirror; after some
j weeks delay, one was installed. Ela
! tion ran high, to be sure. Curious
throngs came to see and marvel at
I the improvement. The library ad
j ministration was 1 hanked many
! times from down deep in the hearts
j and vanities of the men. Now a
i similar boon can be granted the
3,000. Give us soap. It's not a big
I thing to ask for. Cleanliness is next
to godliness; library, please give us
a chair beside godliness. It will be
j appreciated beyond human compre
i hension. —Abe Mellinkoff
