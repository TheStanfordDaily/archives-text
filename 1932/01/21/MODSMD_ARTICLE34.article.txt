### 
THE CHAMP—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Wallace Befry and Jackie Cooper
really spark in this picture. There
is no love interest, but in its place
there has been substituted some
thing far more real—the companion
ship between an ex-champ and his
small son, "Dink." The champ has
degenerated into a souse and a
gambler, but the kid's adoration
moves him to attempt a comeback.
Irene Rich, as "Dink's" mother,
plays the only feminine part in the
picture. It is this fact, perhaps,
which makes her seem a bit too
motherish.
And the Laurel and Hardy fans
should revel in "Beau Hunks." It's
the best thing I've seen them do,
which isn't saying much. —E.E.H.
PEACH O' RENO—At the Varsity
Theatre.
After seeing the show one won
ders if it would be possible to do a
good comedy, novel, or take-off on
the popular theme, life at Reno.
This movie may claim the distinc
tion of being less funny than any
thing we've seen on the subject.
Nothing was funny, to our way of
seeing things, neither Bert Wheeler
nor Bob Woolsey nor the divorce
lawyers' office that was a cafe by
night nor the broadcast station, la
belled GIN.
It seems to us that the reason this
Reno stuff fails is that the thing

, which is to bo laughed at is so much
j more amusing than the version at
I which we are to laugh. That a
j clergyman in good standing should
i actually say (as one recently did)
j that Reno is no worse than any
I other city, that it is just progres
| sive, has more elements of humor
j in it lhan the climax of "Peach O'
j Reno," where the jury at the di
j vorce trial rises and plays "Here
| Comes the Bride" on jazz band in
! struments. —E.T.P.
TRAVELING HUSBANDS—At the
j New Menlo Theatre.
It's (lie old gag about the traveling
salesman made into a first rate
movie with a spicier and more in
teresting plot than we've seen in a
I show for a long time.
It's, the story of how a daughter
! reformed the bad points of her
i otherwise successful father by act
| ing as he did. And it's also the story
of how a young traveling salesman
achieved a big order as well as
winning a bride, by risking his lib
erty protecting the daughter of a
business man who had thrown hijn
out of his office during the preced
i ing day.
' Outside of such incongruities as
i having salesmen stopping at the
] best hotels in town, the picture is a
i real success, with a good deal of
; comedy r.nd wit sprinkled through
jit breaking up the more serious
i moments occupied by an intriguing
! plot. —J.H.G.

business man who had thrown hijn
out of his office during the preced

THE CHAMP—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Wallace Befry and Jackie Cooper
really spark in this picture. There
is no love interest, but in its place
there has been substituted some
thing far more real—the companion
ship between an ex-champ and his
small son, "Dink." The champ has
degenerated into a souse and a
gambler, but the kid's adoration
moves him to attempt a comeback.
Irene Rich, as "Dink's" mother,
plays the only feminine part in the
picture. It is this fact, perhaps,
which makes her seem a bit too
motherish.
And the Laurel and Hardy fans
should revel in "Beau Hunks." It's
the best thing I've seen them do,
which isn't saying much. —E.E.H.
PEACH O' RENO—At the Varsity
Theatre.
After seeing the show one won
ders if it would be possible to do a
good comedy, novel, or take-off on
the popular theme, life at Reno.
This movie may claim the distinc
tion of being less funny than any
thing we've seen on the subject.
Nothing was funny, to our way of
seeing things, neither Bert Wheeler
nor Bob Woolsey nor the divorce
lawyers' office that was a cafe by
night nor the broadcast station, la
belled GIN.
It seems to us that the reason this
Reno stuff fails is that the thing

, which is to bo laughed at is so much
j more amusing than the version at
I which we are to laugh. That a
j clergyman in good standing should
i actually say (as one recently did)
j that Reno is no worse than any
I other city, that it is just progres
| sive, has more elements of humor
j in it lhan the climax of "Peach O'
j Reno," where the jury at the di
j vorce trial rises and plays "Here
| Comes the Bride" on jazz band in

TRAVELING HUSBANDS—At the
j New Menlo Theatre.
It's (lie old gag about the traveling

movie with a spicier and more in

I show for a long time.
It's, the story of how a daughter
! reformed the bad points of her
