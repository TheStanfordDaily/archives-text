THEY DON'T SATISFY
The Editor, Sir:
Some time last quarter an edi
torial in the Daily expressed your
disapproval of the policy of the
powers-that-be at S.C. of not al
lowing cigarette advertisements to
appear in the Daily Trojan. You felt
that it was too bad that the Daily
Trojan should be deprived of the
financial return that would come
from these ads. Some interesting
speculations can be made about this
little question.
In the first place, do the adver
tisers in a university paper get dol
lar-for-dollar returns from the ads
they give you? If you don't think
that they do, then your advertising
managers ought not to sleep well.
If they do make money by adver
tising, it is pretty obvious that the
students themselves pay for these
ads with part of the money that
they spend on the advertiser's prod
uct.
So why not put the effort used in
ad-getting into the improvement of
your paper, and assess the students
the amount that they indirectly pay
anyway (through the advertiser)?
To sum this up: you are either
fooling your advertisers or are mak
ing the student body pay for the
ads that appear in your paper. And
I for one would gladly pay my
share of an amount equal to that
got from advertising, if for no other
reason than to see one publication
free from the drivel about throat
protection and cellophane.
