# RESEARCH WORKER DISCOVERS SEVEN NEW X-RAY LINES
## Ross, Physics Professor, Says Radiations Break Established Law 
### 
Even the strong laws passed by
Mother Nature may have a weak
human tinge, it was disclosed re
cently by the discovery of seven
new lines in (he lower region of
the X-iay spectra by Dr. P. A.
Ross, professor of physics here and
a foremost worker in his field.
Every one of the seven lines, or
radiations of a definite wave-length,
according to Dr. Ross, violated the
established law of atomic mechan
ics that quantum numbers could
only change by zero or one unit.
Instead, these lines, Dr. Ross found,
changed by two or more units.
"Merely a collection of statistical
averages that every million or bil
lion times fails to work as expected,"
Dr. Ross said, characterizing normal
natural laws such as that of the
conservation of matter.
"For several years now," Dr. Ross
levealed, "scientists the world over
have been accumulating facts that
nature's laws may occasionally be
violated—just like any law passed
by man. Only these natural laws
are not broken quite so frequently
as man's laws," Dr. Ross confessed,
referring to a certain amendment
forbidding the sale and manufac
ture of alcoholic beverages.
To discover the seven Jines Dr.
Ross used a remarkably sensitive
double crystal X-ray spectrometer
invented by a professor at Colum
bia. Alter modifying the spectrome
ter to suit his purpose, Dr. Ross
found the seven hitherto unknown
lines : n each of, the shorter X-ray
spectra of such elements as Silver,
Palladium and Rhodium. The lines,
according to Ross, are one to ten
thousands as faint as any other
lines around them, and so very dif
ficult to locate.
