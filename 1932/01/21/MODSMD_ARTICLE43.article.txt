LONDON, Jan. 20. (/P)â€”'The Brit
! ish government, bowing to the in- |
evitable, announced tonight in a
Foreign Office statement it was |
! "evident" the Lausanne reparations
conference could not begin next
Monday as originally had been ;
planned.
The announcement raised doubts
among responsible commentators j
about whether the conference j
would be held at all, and on this i
point the official statement was ex- j
I tremely guarded.
"The conversations which have ,
j been taking place between the gov- j
j ernments chiefly concerned with the
: conference at Lausanne are not yet ]
j concluded and it is evident that the j
| conference cannot be begun as early
as next Monday, the date which had j
| been provisionally arranged," the j
statement said.
