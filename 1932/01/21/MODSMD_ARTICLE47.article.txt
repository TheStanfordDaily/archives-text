LAGUNA BEACH, Jan. 20. </P) â€” j
The mystery of a ball of fire which j
fell into the ocean off here last night j
and which was investigated by au- j
torities on the theory it might have ;
been an aiiplane, was solved today
by a witness, who said it was the
fragment of a meteor. Richard M.
Marriner of Laguna Boach said he
saw the meteor shoot out of the
north and disappear to the south, a
fragment of it breaking off and fall- j
ing in a streak of fire into the ocean.
The least number of home runs j
made by a team in the American
league in one season falls to the lot
of Washington who in 1917 made
but four. '
