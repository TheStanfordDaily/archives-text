WARNER SYSTEM vs. Warner
System.
Old Master vs. Pupil.
That may be the picture next fall
as Stanford and San Francisco Uni
versity meet on the gridiron for the
first time. The Dons, seeking a coach
to replace the ousted Jimmy
Needles, seem to be looking with
l'avor on Warner system applicants.
Willi their greatest rivals, St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, coached
by Notre Dame men, it is na
tural that the S.F.U. authorities
should seek something else.
Thus we find a number of Pop's
greatest pupils among the lead
ing contestants for the post,
.with none other than Ernie
Nevers, the greatest of them all,
heading the list.
Ernie tossed his headgear into the
ling yesterday, making a trip to the
city to confer with the powers at
the hilltop institution. This might
be construed as an indication that
Nevers, after six long seasons, is
getting fed up on the professional
game. He has been as successful a
coach as player for the Chicago
Cardinals, and will undoubtedly be
considered in a favorable light at
S.F.U.
Another leading Stanford candi
date is Spud Lewis, now on his way
to the coast for an interview with
the Dons. Dick Han ley spoke well j
of Lewis during his visit here for J
the Shrine game. Lewis has been
backfield coach for Hanley at North
western for several seasons. Fred
Swan, line coach at Wisconsin, is
also seeking the post, having jour
neyed out to chew the rag v/ith the
authorities last week.
Ted Shipkey, Warner's great All-
American end, who is now coaching
at Arizorla Teachers College, is an
other former Card who is in line
for the job. Hack Applequist is a
Warner advocate who has been
mentioned for the position. While
he got his sheepskin at Washington
Stale, he has used Pop's stuff v/ith
great success at Sacramento Jaysee. I
His teams have not only been un- ,
defeated for three years in junior
college competition, but have won !
most of their other games as well. 1
Among the Noire Dame ap
plicants are Marty Brill. Christy
Flanagan, Johnny O'Brien, Tim
Monyhan, and Jack Chevingny.
The latter appears to head the
Rocknc contingent.
Should the Dons get a Warner j
coach, Tony Donadio, the "Mighty ;
Mite" from Sacramento, will un- |
doubtedly be seen to better advan
tage next season. It was under
Applequist that he made his repu
tation, but as a part of a system
which depended on power rather
than deception, he didn't show up to
( xpeclalions for S.F.U. last fall.
AND STILL the hard luck con
tinues.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry will not be
available to Basketball Coach John !
Bunti until at least another week — I
and that means after the first Cali- j
lornia game. The dynamic little for
ward will have to rest for a while !
longer before his injured leg will be
able to stand the gaff.
And just by way of complicat
ing matters, "Frenchy" La-
Coinbe, the other regular for
ward. is stiil troubled by his
football knee; Reggie Mead, who
played a really good game
against Ihe Trojans, is sick
with Ihe sinus trouble that has
bothered him all season; Doub,
whom it was thought would be
ready for work this week, will
not be in uniform until next *
week at least; and Sclinetka, a
very promising guard, is still in
the hospital with a severe cold.

Should the Dons get a Warner j
coach, Tony Donadio, the "Mighty ;
Mite" from Sacramento, will un- |
doubtedly be seen to better advan
tage next season. It was under
Applequist that he made his repu
tation, but as a part of a system
which depended on power rather
than deception, he didn't show up to
( xpeclalions for S.F.U. last fall.
AND STILL the hard luck con
tinues.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry will not be
available to Basketball Coach John !
Bunti until at least another week — I
and that means after the first Cali- j
lornia game. The dynamic little for
ward will have to rest for a while !
longer before his injured leg will be
able to stand the gaff.
And just by way of complicat
ing matters, "Frenchy" La-
Coinbe, the other regular for
ward. is stiil troubled by his
football knee; Reggie Mead, who
played a really good game
against Ihe Trojans, is sick
with Ihe sinus trouble that has
bothered him all season; Doub,
whom it was thought would be
ready for work this week, will
not be in uniform until next *
week at least; and Sclinetka, a
very promising guard, is still in
the hospital with a severe cold.

WARNER SYSTEM vs. Warner
System.
Old Master vs. Pupil.
That may be the picture next fall
as Stanford and San Francisco Uni
versity meet on the gridiron for the
first time. The Dons, seeking a coach
to replace the ousted Jimmy
Needles, seem to be looking with
l'avor on Warner system applicants.
Willi their greatest rivals, St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, coached
by Notre Dame men, it is na
tural that the S.F.U. authorities
should seek something else.
Thus we find a number of Pop's
greatest pupils among the lead
ing contestants for the post,
.with none other than Ernie
Nevers, the greatest of them all,
heading the list.
Ernie tossed his headgear into the
ling yesterday, making a trip to the
city to confer with the powers at
the hilltop institution. This might
be construed as an indication that
Nevers, after six long seasons, is
getting fed up on the professional
game. He has been as successful a
coach as player for the Chicago
Cardinals, and will undoubtedly be
considered in a favorable light at
S.F.U.
Another leading Stanford candi
date is Spud Lewis, now on his way
to the coast for an interview with
the Dons. Dick Han ley spoke well j
of Lewis during his visit here for J
the Shrine game. Lewis has been
backfield coach for Hanley at North
western for several seasons. Fred
Swan, line coach at Wisconsin, is
also seeking the post, having jour
neyed out to chew the rag v/ith the
authorities last week.
Ted Shipkey, Warner's great All-
American end, who is now coaching
at Arizorla Teachers College, is an
other former Card who is in line
for the job. Hack Applequist is a
Warner advocate who has been
mentioned for the position. While
he got his sheepskin at Washington
Stale, he has used Pop's stuff v/ith
great success at Sacramento Jaysee. I
His teams have not only been un- ,
defeated for three years in junior
college competition, but have won !
most of their other games as well. 1
Among the Noire Dame ap
plicants are Marty Brill. Christy
Flanagan, Johnny O'Brien, Tim
Monyhan, and Jack Chevingny.
The latter appears to head the
Rocknc contingent.
