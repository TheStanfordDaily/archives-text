# Indian Sluggers To Open Season Here Saturday
## LEAGUE CHAMPS WILL MEET CLUB NINE FOR OPENER Five [Not Clear] Will Form Team Nucleus; Estes, Livermore Start 
### Bob Wade 
With 2:30 Saturday afternoon the
time, and Ihe sunken diamond the
place, Stanford's varsity baseball
team will open the season against
the Olympic sluggers when Bob
Estes, former Paly High chucker,
shoots ihe first one over the plate
to Ike Livermore, letterman from
last year's championship outfit.
The local nine will present a line
up of five veterans, and four new
men, but before the afternoon's
festivities are over Coach Harry
Wolter will probably have an idea
of what two or three of his nines
can do under fire.
Behind the platter will be Ike
Livermore, who caught Dan John
son through both his freshman and
sophomore seasons. At second and
shortstop, respectively, will cavort
last year's double-play combination
of Philippi and Delmas. The hot
corner is still undecided, as is left
field, but out in the other two gar
dens Wolter has last year's guard
ians, Rintala and Campbell.
The Olympic Club is an unknown
quantity. Two years ago they gave
the Indians a pair of setbacks, last
season's contest being rained out.
But if past performances mean any
thing, Coach "Cack" Hubbard's boys
will give the Redskins a tough af
ternoon. • ,
