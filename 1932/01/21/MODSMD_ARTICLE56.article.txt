# SOPHS WIN CLOSE WATER POLO CLASH FROM FROSH
## 
### DICK VAN WAGENEN 
After a struggle so closely con
tested that it carried into an extra
period, the sophomore water poloists
yesterday barely nosed out the Babe
seven by an 8 to 7 count. Ted
Wiget, one of the two varsity team
men on the sophomore machine, ac
counted for all except one of the
second-year men's scores, the decid
ing goal coming from the hands of
McDowell in the extra period.
Jimmy Triolo, sprint for the year
lings, burned in four goals to Cap
tain Boothe's two and Benet's one.
Not once did either team gain a
margin of more than one goal, so
closely contested was the tussle. At
the end of the regular period the
count stood 7-7, Triolo and Wiget
each having fired the ball through
the opposing goalie to hold the score
at a tie.
No substitutions were made at
any time, the original lineup holding
good for the entire contest. For the
sophomores, Wiget was by far the

I outstanding player, his beautiful
: shots coming thick and fast at
| times. Goalie Cook of the babes did
j well to ward off many a Wiget at
i tack.
Juniors and seniors clash this af
ternoon at 4:30 in the only remain
j ing preliminary contest, which will
I be closed to the public. The winner
of this tussle meets the sophomores
| Saturday in the finals, which will
be for the benefit of the Palo Alto
Shelter. Ten cents per student will
â€¢ be collected at this, the only game
of the series open to the public. In
i addition, the freshmen will take on
! the loser of today's contest, and ex
i hibition diving will add to the pro
| gram.
