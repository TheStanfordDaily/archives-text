### 
Four out of six freshman basket
i ball seasons have brought Little
i Big Series victories to Stanford
! fives, :nd Saturday niqht Coach
j Vance Fawcett's" 1932 Indian yeav
j lings will take the Pavilion floor,
; determined to get off on a flying
j start toward another trio of wins at
j the expense of a green, but im
! proving Bear Cub team. Tuesday
j night the Californians played their
I last practice game of the season,
j defeating the Columbia Park Boys
I quintet by a 33-28 score.
j The Papooses had their last seri
• ous workout last night, with every
member of the squad getting into
j a fairly long scrimmage. Tom Sales
| and Joe Butte were absent from
| practice, but Tom Kelly and Wally
j Crowe filled into their places ca
| pably. The reserve five did some
: good work, with the two guards,
• Jim Savage and Vincent Meyer,
! working well together.
J Last year the Bear Cubs got very
'i "hot" in the deciding game of the
j series, with Eiffert, present varsity
i forward, dropping in shots from all
I angles. California doesn't seem to
| have any scoring threat to take Eif
j fc-rt's place, however, unless it is
1 Dave Meeks, a star on the Bear
j yearling grid team.
Tomorrow night the Indians meet
Fresno High in the only game of the
j evening. Fresno's practice season
| record has been impressive, but the
| calibre of their opponents is not too
! strong.
