# CLARK BREAKS 300-YARD TANK MARK IN TRIAL
## Nationwide Intercollegiate Record Shattered In Unofficial Swim 
### 
Bob Clark, star all-around man
; on the varsity tank squad, yesterday
I broke the national intercollegiate
i 300-yard medley record unofficially
| by no less than 11.5 seconds. The
! present record of 4 minutes, 8.6 sec
| onds, was made in 1930 by Harte of
I Yale.
Splashing his way back and forth
| through the sixty-foot pool, dis
j playing a marvelous set of strokes,
] especially the breast, Clark finished
| in 3 minutes 57.1 seconds, to better
i the old time by a wide margin. The
\ mark was made in time trials with
j out competition.
Clark has been doing steadiyl im
- proving work all through the year,
I and should by no means be at his
I peak, since he is only a sophomore
I and still capable of development,
j If the team goes East to Annapolis
: this year for the national champion
j ships, however, Clark will not make
j the journey, as the Cards do not
; expect to enter this particular-event.
