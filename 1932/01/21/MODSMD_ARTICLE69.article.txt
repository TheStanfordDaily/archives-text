A stir was created at the senate finance committee, investigating
foreign loans, when Assistant Secretary Francis White of the state
department refused to turn over correspondence relating to the Barco
oil concession. The correspondence was asked during questioning
regarding the restoration of the concession and the granting of a loan
to Columbia by American bankers. White (left) is shown with Senator
Smoot (center), committee chairman, and H. Freeman Matthews of
