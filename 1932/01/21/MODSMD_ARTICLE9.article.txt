# FRESHMEN TO VOTE MONDAY ON HONOR COUNCIL PROPOSAL
## 
### 
First definite discussion of plans
for the new Freshman Men's Honor
Council was held last night with
representative members of the
freshman class, when Men's Coun
cil met with a large and enthusias
tic group of first-year men at Toyon
Hall.
Since constitutional objections
have been raised against making the
group a freshman class affair, it is
now planned to make it function of
the freshman members of Encina
Club, with the possibility of an at
tempt to amend the A.S.S.U. con
stitution at the February election.
With 1 his object in view, an elec
tion will be held Monday night at
Encina Hall between 7:30 afid 9
o'clock. Nominations may be sub
mitted to Aylett Cotton, freshman
class president, until tomorrow
night. Men's Council will choose 20
men from the list of nominees, and
nine men will be elected Monday
night from this selected group.
Milton Hand, Men's Council chair
man, explained that the freshman
body will consist of nine members
instead of five, like the Men's
Council, in order that at least one
or two members may know every
man in the class.
