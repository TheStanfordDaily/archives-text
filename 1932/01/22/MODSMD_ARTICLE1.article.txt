# Five Players On Bench As Bears Invade Stanford
## Price Plans to Launch His Strongest Scoring Machine Against the Indians; Starting Lineup Will Average Six Feet in Height DOUB, CORDRY, SCHNETKA ARE ON SICK LIST Trojans Lead League, Cards or U.C. Will Be Forced From Flag Race After Tomorrow's Battle 
### DICK RODDA 
IjJ ANDICAPPED by injuries that may force five regulars to watch the
the game from the bench, the Stanford basketball quintet meets the
California Bears here tomorrow night iit the first of the Big Series with a
fighting chance to win. With three men, Doub, Cordry, and Sclmetka still
left over from last week's sick list the Indians find themselves this week
looking for a couple of more substitutes to take the places of Edelen and
Meade. Edelen lost a toenail in turning in a splendid performance at
guard against the Trojans last week, and has not been up to par all week.
Meade was given permission to practice last night but complained again
of his sinus trouble and watched his *

teammates from the sidelines. .
Starting Five Good
Meanwhile Coach John Bunn has
rounded up a starting five that
doesn't look so bad despite the
length of the hospital list. Dave
Packard, because of his height, will
open at center with LaCombe and
Cosgrove at the forwards and Nor
gard. and Baker at the guards. Ede
len was slated to start at one of the
guards until his toe began to bother
him. He will probably be on the
bench but it is not likely that he
will see action.

Other casaba tossers who will be
mixing it up with the Bears are
John Hancock and Bill Jenkins at
center, Chuck Glasgow and Payne
Palmer at forward, and Jay Tod at
guard. Hancock and Jenkins gave
excellent accounts of themselves in
the Trojan series last week.
Indians, Bears Tied
The chances of either Stanford or
California to stay in the league lace
depend upon the outcome of tomor
row's classic since both teams are
tied for second place, having won
and lost double games from U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. respectively. Whichever
team loses will be almost too far in
the hole to overcome the leading
Trojans unless the U.C.L.A. Bruins
happen to upset the dope this week
end when they meet "Silent Sam"
Barry's outfit.
Nibs Price will start his strongest
scoring combination against the In
dians. Kintana and Eiffert will be
the forwards with Reed at center
and Ohashi and Captain Vendt at
guards, a five that averages more
than six feet in height. Kintana gave
the Cards a whole lot of trouble last
year and Eiffert was a one-man
freshman team.
Polishes Offense
The Bears have been slowly im
proving since the beginning of the
season and are about ready to hit
their peak. They didn't look so good
two weeks ago against the Trojans,
but came back to look like a dif
ferent team in trouncing the
| U.C.L.A. Bruins a week later. Early
this week they polished up their
offense against the California Aggies
to ihe tune of 48 to 22.
Tomorrow's game will be much
more interesting from the specta
tor's standpoint than were the last
games here as Price's men are in
; the habit of playing fast basketball
| which the Indians are not incapable
of matching.
Stanford's attack for the Bears
was worked out in three tough
1 scrimmages on the first three days
1 of this week. Bunn gave the boys a
rest last night, concentrating on in
dividual play. The squad will have
I another light session in fundament
' als tonight.

IjJ ANDICAPPED by injuries that may force five regulars to watch the
the game from the bench, the Stanford basketball quintet meets the
California Bears here tomorrow night iit the first of the Big Series with a
fighting chance to win. With three men, Doub, Cordry, and Sclmetka still
left over from last week's sick list the Indians find themselves this week
looking for a couple of more substitutes to take the places of Edelen and
Meade. Edelen lost a toenail in turning in a splendid performance at
guard against the Trojans last week, and has not been up to par all week.
Meade was given permission to practice last night but complained again
of his sinus trouble and watched his *

teammates from the sidelines. .
Starting Five Good
Meanwhile Coach John Bunn has
rounded up a starting five that
doesn't look so bad despite the
length of the hospital list. Dave
Packard, because of his height, will
open at center with LaCombe and
Cosgrove at the forwards and Nor
gard. and Baker at the guards. Ede
len was slated to start at one of the
guards until his toe began to bother
him. He will probably be on the
bench but it is not likely that he
will see action.

Other casaba tossers who will be
mixing it up with the Bears are
John Hancock and Bill Jenkins at
center, Chuck Glasgow and Payne
Palmer at forward, and Jay Tod at
guard. Hancock and Jenkins gave
excellent accounts of themselves in
the Trojan series last week.
Indians, Bears Tied
The chances of either Stanford or
California to stay in the league lace
depend upon the outcome of tomor
row's classic since both teams are
tied for second place, having won
and lost double games from U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. respectively. Whichever
team loses will be almost too far in
the hole to overcome the leading
Trojans unless the U.C.L.A. Bruins
happen to upset the dope this week
end when they meet "Silent Sam"
Barry's outfit.
Nibs Price will start his strongest
scoring combination against the In
dians. Kintana and Eiffert will be
the forwards with Reed at center
and Ohashi and Captain Vendt at
guards, a five that averages more
than six feet in height. Kintana gave
the Cards a whole lot of trouble last
year and Eiffert was a one-man
freshman team.
Polishes Offense
The Bears have been slowly im
proving since the beginning of the
season and are about ready to hit
their peak. They didn't look so good
two weeks ago against the Trojans,
but came back to look like a dif
ferent team in trouncing the
| U.C.L.A. Bruins a week later. Early
this week they polished up their
offense against the California Aggies
to ihe tune of 48 to 22.
Tomorrow's game will be much
more interesting from the specta
tor's standpoint than were the last
games here as Price's men are in
; the habit of playing fast basketball
| which the Indians are not incapable
of matching.
Stanford's attack for the Bears
was worked out in three tough
1 scrimmages on the first three days
1 of this week. Bunn gave the boys a
rest last night, concentrating on in
dividual play. The squad will have
I another light session in fundament
' als tonight.
