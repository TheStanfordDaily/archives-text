# Soviet Reno Unnecessary Stanford Adventurer Brings Back Tales New Russia Topsy-Turvy
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Russia seen by a Stanford student j
becomes a place to delight Ripley,
baffle Alice In Wonderland, or com
pletely discourage the Baron Mun
chausen.
At least this is the impression j
brought, home recently by Nicol |
Smith, Chi Psi and junior at Stan
ford. On previous jaunts this local '
Halliburton has canoed down the'
Danube, swum the Hellespont,
pranced naked in a German nudist
colony, and dined at cannibal isles.
"Everything is topsyturvy in I
Russia," he observes. "Youth is in :
the saddle, age and experience arc I
scorned. The beautiful old build
ings are falling to decay. The ugly
new buildings are only half-finished.
There isn't enough of anything, food, ;
water, transportation, clothes, or i
service. Dirty, rough-clad peasants :
dash through the cobbled streets in
expensive American automobiles, 1
and workmen live in palaces oi '
nobles.
i

I "Everything beautiful and moral
seems to have gone out of Russian
I life. The women work at hard labor
l and are mannish and ugly. Family
; ties are meaningless. A woman with
three children came into the mar
i riage and divorce bureau while I
was there. She had been married
! twelve years, she said, but was ti.-ed
i of her husband.
' "She handed over a few roubles,
! wrote her name in the book and
: walked out with a decree. A young
i couple who had been married four
: days were next in line. They had
I enjoyed a week-end holiday to
; gcther, and now paid for a divorce
; and departed their separate ways."
The traveler brought back a pro
found impression of the hardships of
Russian life. He says that a house
' wite must stand six hours in the
' food lines to get rations for the day.
Privacy is unknown, people go half
' clad, and good shoes would cost in
our money $100.
