# SPUD LEWIS TO COACH DONS ON GRID NEXT FALL
## Former Card Star To Lead S.F.U. Against Old Fox In 1932 Season 
### 
It will be the Old Fox against one
of his smartest pupils when Stan
ford and San Francisco University
meet on the gridiron for the first
time next fall.
After several weeks of considera
tion, the San Francisco institution
yesterday announced the selection
of Lawrence ("Spud") Lewis to re
place Jimmy Needles, whose resig
nation was requested some time ago,
as head football coach.
Assisted Hanlcy
Since Lewis last played for Stan
ford only three years ago, he has
been assistant to Dick Hanley of
Northwestern, a Warner system dis
ciple. His appointment eliminates
four other Stanford aspirants for
the job: Ernie Nevers, Fred Swan,
Ted Shipkey, and Harry Shipkey.
Nevers was the last to apply signi
fying his desire for the post only
last Tuesday.
Commenting on the appointment,
Pop Warner declared last night, "I
congratulate Lewis for securing this
position and S.F.U. for getting a
good man. Since several of my for
mer pupils were among those under
consideration, I was naturally nutral
in the matter and had nothing to
do with the selection. I feel that
Lewis is capable and will make good
in his new position."

Lewis played his last game at
quarterback for Stanford in 1928
when he led the Cards in a 26 to 0
triumph over Army in New York
that startled the football world. He
was also an important part of Stan
ford's thrilling tie in the Big Game
a week before.
Lewis arrived in San Francisco
with his wife yesterday morning. He
will begin coaching the "Dons" with
the opening of spring practice this
year.
San Francisco University football
teams have used the Notre Dame
system in the past but because their
chief rivals are more successful
with it, they decided to switch. This
eliminated Notre Dame stars such
as Jack Chevigny, Marty Brill and
Tim Moynihan who were also candi
dates for the job.
