# Seniors Clash With Sophs In Benefit Game
## Water Polo Finals To Help; Palo Alto Jobless 
### 
Stanford athletes will perform for i
the benefit of Palo Alto's unem- ;
ployed tomorrow afternoon.
Fans will be offered a chance to >
experience that "I have given'' >
satisfaction together with an oppor- j
tunity to witness some of the na- ■
tion's greatest collegiate swimmers j
in action at 2 o'clock in Encina pool j
—all for the paltry sum of one thin |
dime.
Battle Expected
As to the event itself, scheduled I
as the finals of interclass water polo, |
the seniors and sophomores will j
fight it out for the school title in a j
battle which promises to be no less '
than ferocious.
These two teams gained the right j
to meet for the title by virtue of j
victories over the freshman and jun- j
ior outfit yesterday, the sophomores {
taking the former 8 to 7, and the <
fourth-year men trouncing the jun- 1
iors by a 7 to 2 count. Woods was j
outstanding for the senior team, j
which is composed of five varsity>
regulars plus McKclvey and Avery, j
the former at sprint and the latter j
at guard.
Knapp Good
Clapp and Booth at forward, Har- I
ris at center back, Woods at guard, j
and Linton at goal make up the re- j
mainder of the senior seven. Woods i
scored three of the goals, McKclvey j
two, and Clapp and Booth each one i
yesterday. Goalie Knapp of the |
second-year men kept the score i
down through his very effective
work, and was the outstanding jun- ;
ior, even though Kinkead, a regular j
varsity man, handle one guard po- j
sition. The other five poloists on the
losing squad were Warren, sprint;
Edwards, forward; Pease, forward;
Simons, center back, and Throndson,
guard. Tibbetts acted as substitute
and general utility man, scoring one
of the two goals. Edwards accounted
for the other.
Tomorrow's program will include j
the final game, a contest between !
the smooth-working freshman out
fit, and the juniors for third place,
and some exhibition diving by Bill
Campbell and Bob Wardwell.

than ferocious.
These two teams gained the right j
to meet for the title by virtue of j
victories over the freshman and jun- j
ior outfit yesterday, the sophomores {
taking the former 8 to 7, and the <
fourth-year men trouncing the jun- 1
iors by a 7 to 2 count. Woods was j
outstanding for the senior team, j
which is composed of five varsity>
regulars plus McKclvey and Avery, j
the former at sprint and the latter j
at guard.
Knapp Good
Clapp and Booth at forward, Har- I
ris at center back, Woods at guard, j
and Linton at goal make up the re- j
mainder of the senior seven. Woods i
scored three of the goals, McKclvey j
two, and Clapp and Booth each one i
yesterday. Goalie Knapp of the |
second-year men kept the score i
down through his very effective
work, and was the outstanding jun- ;
ior, even though Kinkead, a regular j
varsity man, handle one guard po- j
sition. The other five poloists on the
losing squad were Warren, sprint;
Edwards, forward; Pease, forward;
Simons, center back, and Throndson,
guard. Tibbetts acted as substitute
and general utility man, scoring one
of the two goals. Edwards accounted
for the other.
Tomorrow's program will include j
the final game, a contest between !
the smooth-working freshman out
fit, and the juniors for third place,
and some exhibition diving by Bill
Campbell and Bob Wardwell.
Stanford athletes will perform for i
the benefit of Palo Alto's unem- ;
ployed tomorrow afternoon.
Fans will be offered a chance to >
experience that "I have given'' >
satisfaction together with an oppor- j
tunity to witness some of the na- ■
tion's greatest collegiate swimmers j
in action at 2 o'clock in Encina pool j
—all for the paltry sum of one thin |
dime.
Battle Expected
As to the event itself, scheduled I
as the finals of interclass water polo, |
the seniors and sophomores will j
fight it out for the school title in a j
battle which promises to be no less '
than ferocious.
