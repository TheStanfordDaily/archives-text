# SUCCESS OF HONOR CODE UP TO FROSH, HAND TELLS GROUP
## 
### 
"The older generation of Stanford !
students has lost its enthusiasm. If j
the Honor Code is to be successful, |
it's up to the freshman class and j
those to follow it to niHke the system i
work. The problem of making the !
, Code function properly is relatively
simple, but it must not be neglected;
! it must be hammered at constantly."
I Thus Milton Hand, Men's Council
j chairman, summarized his views on j
the "success-or-failurc" angle of the (
! Code,, at a meeting with a group of
j freshmen last, night.
Aylett Cotton, president of the j
j freshman class, outlined the reasons j
| for having a Freshman Men's Honor
i Council and plans for its function
ing. Edgar A. Boyles, Men's Council
1 secretary, defined the various forms
jof cheating and enumerated the i
j punishments which his body can j
j mete out to offenders.
Charles Flanagan, prominent in
I the Freshman Council movement,
| said, "Our class has entered Stan
| ford at a crucial timeâ€”a time when
j the success or failure of the Honor
Code depends on the incoming class.
We are that class. We must try to
j complete our entire four years at
j Stanford without ;i single Code vio
j lation."
