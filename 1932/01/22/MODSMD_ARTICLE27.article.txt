# WE AIN'T SO POPULAR

Once upon a time- last fall to be exact—the Daily Cali
fornia/! had an editor named Jack Mason, who was a pretty
clever youth with a fine sense of humor. When the Stan
roßD Daily razzed California hist year for its attitude fol
lowing the (i-0 football defeat at the hands of Southern
California, Mason sat down and wrote a merry jibe at Stan
ford which made the editor of the Stanford Daily look
rather silly. Rut Mason, as we have said before, was a
pretty clever youth with a sense of humor, and, as it was
all in fun, nobody got hot under the collar.
Rut times have changed across the bay. A gentleman
named Alfred SchaefTer now sits in the editorial offices
of the Daily Calif ornian, and Friend SchaefTer is not only
devoid of the comic spirit, but he is imbued with a choler
that may drag him off Ibis mortal coil some day, unless he
keeps it under belter control.
Because the Stanford Daily criticised a lot of things
it thought was wrong with last week's' Southern California
basketball series, Friend Schaeffer, nursing in his bosom
the editorial razzing handed California last fall, leaps for
ward and says, "Yah! The shoe is on the other foot now.
The editor of the Stanford Da'LY is a Ihis-and-that; further
more, he is a such-and-such."
If Schaeffer witnessed the Stanford-Trojan games here,
we wonder at his inability to see cause for criticism of the
officiating and the Harry antics. The Daily would like to
point out just two things. First, Roy Cummings, sports
writer for the Call-Bulletin, I'.C. graduate and rabid Rear
supporter, characterized the work of William Dunn as the
worst he had ever seen. The Daily won't reprint what
Harry Rorba of the News and Rill Leiser of the Examiner
said about it, because the fact that they are Stanford grad
uates may disqualify them as critics in Schaeffcr's eyes.
Secondly, Ned Kay, also a I'.C. graduate, the referee
during the series, was so disgusted with Dunn's work in the
lirst game that he told reporters between halves he was
going out and call the rest of the game bv himself. He
didn't do what he threatened, but his remarks may en
lighten Schaeffer somewhat.
Incidentally, if Schaeffer DIDN'T witness the games,
then he has considerable nerve to orate in the manner de
scribed.
As for the Daily Trojan— well, Tom Patterson, the same
youth who wept tears of gratitude on our shoulder after
that same razzing editorial that aroused the Californians'
ire, has now repudiated us completely. Hopeful at first
that the Daily was free from malice about Southern Cali
fornia. says Patterson, Trojans have seen the Stanford
paper become "an organ of cheap claptrap reflecting a
disgruntled attitude against Stanford's recent athletic
shortcomings, which stand in obvious relief against South
ern California's present athletic supremacy."
Knroute south from the Pacific Intercollegiate Press
convention at Kugene last fall, Patterson lost SO cents at
bridge to the editor of the organ for cheap anti-S.C. clap
trap. The memory of that SO cents was obviously upper
most in the Trojan editor's mind when he wrote the article
(juoted above. We KNOW Patterson didn't see the games.
In conclusion, we would like to say this to Messrs.
Schaeffer and Patterson. What the Stanford Daily said
about the Trojans' brand of play, the work of William
Dunn and the gambolings of Sam Rarrv, still goes. We still
think that Californians and Southern Californians are nice
boys, as we don't judge the former by their editor or the
latter by their basketball team. Acting on that principle,
we beseech the Stanford rooting section to refrain from
booing tomorrow night when California conies to the Pa
vilion for the lirst game of the Rig Series. The Rlue and
Gold quintets play rough, but never dirty basketball, and
the officials, Herb Dana and Lloyd Leith, have never failed
to call what fhev see. Give them a break.
