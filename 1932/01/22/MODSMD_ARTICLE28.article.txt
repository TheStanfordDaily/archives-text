# BULL SESSION
## THE 						DIVORCE RACKET 
### 
One of the reputed cornerstones
of this nation is ''equality before
the law." At least, all Fourth of
July orators take great pains in ex
plaining this glorious ideal—for
which the patriots gave their lives
at the Concord bridge and the fields
of Lexington or was it the Concord
fields and the bridge of Lexington?
It. really makes little difference for
the present. Anyone who has lis
tened to soap box orators knows
that their favorite expression is,
"There are two laws—one for the
Rich and another for the Poor." I
used to mumble "sour grapes" and
pass on; now I mumble "defense
mechanism," and pass on.
But there is some truth in their
statement,, and in no way can it be
seen more clearly and more humor
ously than in this divorce racket.
From village justice, it has grown
to a national business and now
threatens to enter the international
field in force. The person who hadn't
bought on margin can go to Reno
for six weeks, pay a court fee, and
come back for all intents and pur
poses a "free person." Those not so
fortunate, financially, however, are
either forced to stay married or
come before the court and admit
some serious marital difficulty be
fore they can once more be turned
into circulation. Either procedure is
unfair.
New York Slate with its very
strict marriage laws feels probably
that it is protecting the morals of
its citizens. In reality, the only

i people that are getting the "protec
-1 tion" are the ones that are too poor
Ito tako a trip to Reno—and live
there for six weeks. The twenty
' dollar-a-week clerks are bound to
| perpetuity to their spouses in most
cases. Now, it may be the best thing
i in the world for marriage bonds to
last forever; but for the bonds to
| be tissue paper for certain brackets
jof the income tax and tempered
> steel links for those that never even
| have the doubtful pleasure of filling
i out those voluminous blanks is just
I rank injustice.
Now, however, an international
factor has entered upon the scene.
| Juarez, a Mexican city along the
! Texas border, has offered divorces
i with a one-day residence require
; ment and for the nominal fee of
j $50. Now, we can expect Nevada to
! come before the Congress and ask
i a tariff protection, an export deben
| ture, a federal subsidy, or some aid
i to meet the foreign competition. Her
i major industry is at stake.
i
At least Juarez will make the
! ayenue of marital escape a little
! cheaper. Its low residence require
j ment, and its more central location
to the populous East, will meet the
requirements of those that found
the expense of Reno fully compen
sated for by the boredom or unhap
piness of married life. Now people
I can balance their honeymoon to
I Niagara Falls with a vinegar-sun
j to Juarez. But still the masses are
j being discriminated against; not
| everybody can afford to take the
[wife to Juarez. —Abe MellinkofE
