Although the anonymous author
of this book loudly insists that it is
a serious piece of work, seriously
ironic \hat is, it is blatantly evident
that the book is a parody, and Som
erset Maugham is the victim.
But even if you are totally un
familiar with Someret Maugham
and his last book, you will be cap
tured by the deftness of "Gin and
Bitters." The style of the book is
deceptively smooth and graceful. It
almost conceals the real tone. But
after a few pages are read, one
senses that there is something un
derneath the author's quiet, de
tached manipulation of incidents,
and gradually one becomes aware of
the stinging quality of the author's
satire.
The unknown author is extraor
dinarily supercilious. He describes
situation?; of shocking implications
in a casual way, refusing to be ex
cited about immorality—about any
thing in fact, but his main charac
ter. The latter is somehow enor
mously appealing just because nei
ther he nor the author tries to pre
tend that he is at all admirable or
attractive. —M.L.R.

BURY: An Autobiography —
George Arliss. Cornwall Press.
In one of the most truly enter
taining of the modern biographies,
George Arliss, beloved actor and
motion picture star, gives a splendid
resume of the evolution of the mod
ern stage—and movie. His career is
wound up in its development—lie
has added much to its success, him
self.
A very human man writing a very
human autobiography is nearly al
ways a success with the ordinary
reader—this is, certainly, and adds
many an intellectual tidbit for the
informed.
If you have any interest in anec
dotes about famous personages, or
back-stage talk, here you have it
first-hand—and told by one of the
better story-tellers. George Arliss

I has made of his life's work a color
! ful novel—with his romance, and his
i disappointments and successes fol
i lowing each other in a steady flow.
Here is autobiography, popular
! ized for the hundreds by a stage
i idol—selling itself to the book-read
! ing public because of-its humor and
• charm. —V.B.T.

BURY: An Autobiography —
George Arliss. Cornwall Press.
In one of the most truly enter
taining of the modern biographies,
George Arliss, beloved actor and
motion picture star, gives a splendid
resume of the evolution of the mod
ern stage—and movie. His career is
wound up in its development—lie
has added much to its success, him
self.
A very human man writing a very
human autobiography is nearly al
ways a success with the ordinary
reader—this is, certainly, and adds
many an intellectual tidbit for the
informed.
If you have any interest in anec
dotes about famous personages, or
back-stage talk, here you have it
first-hand—and told by one of the
better story-tellers. George Arliss

I has made of his life's work a color
! ful novel—with his romance, and his
i disappointments and successes fol
i lowing each other in a steady flow.
Here is autobiography, popular
! ized for the hundreds by a stage
i idol—selling itself to the book-read
! ing public because of-its humor and
• charm. —V.B.T.
GIN AND BlTTERS—Anonymous.
Although the anonymous author
of this book loudly insists that it is
a serious piece of work, seriously
ironic \hat is, it is blatantly evident
that the book is a parody, and Som
erset Maugham is the victim.
But even if you are totally un
familiar with Someret Maugham
and his last book, you will be cap
tured by the deftness of "Gin and
Bitters." The style of the book is
deceptively smooth and graceful. It
almost conceals the real tone. But
after a few pages are read, one
senses that there is something un
derneath the author's quiet, de
tached manipulation of incidents,
and gradually one becomes aware of
the stinging quality of the author's
satire.
The unknown author is extraor
dinarily supercilious. He describes
situation?; of shocking implications
in a casual way, refusing to be ex
cited about immorality—about any
thing in fact, but his main charac
ter. The latter is somehow enor
mously appealing just because nei
ther he nor the author tries to pre
tend that he is at all admirable or
attractive. —M.L.R.
