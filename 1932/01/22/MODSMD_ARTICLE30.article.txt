The chief merit of this detective
! story is that the murderer is not
! apparent until revealed by the de
! tective. Its chief fault is that it is
J not very exciting.
j A noted playwright is murdered
iin a remote Connecticut artists'
i colony. His relations with other
j people are such that suspicion falls
j on everyone in the colony, as well
: as a few outsiders. In fact the sus
j pects are so numerous and so nebu
j lous that one immediately gives up
j the attempt to identify the mur-
I derer and waits for the author to
, leveal him in her own good time.
| It is sad to think of the really good
i story Mary Roberts Rinehart, for
| example, could create from this
! same plot.
However, there are four killings,
\ three men and a cat, and a few
J attempted murders, and, unfortun
' ately, ihe book is up to the average
| level of murder mysteries. —F.J.
