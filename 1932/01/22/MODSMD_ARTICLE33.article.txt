; The Eciitor, Sir:
Far be it from me to want to cn
j gage in a long and drawn-out foren
j sic duel over the economics of ad
j vertising .... But if that editorial
| constitutes your full reply, I think
I have just about made my point.
It is pretty clear that the Palo
Alto merchant (for we might as well
thresh this out on local grounds)
adds the costs of the advertisements
he puts in the Daily to the price of
the goods that he sells to the Stan
ford student. Therefore the student
pays that $11 anyway, but he pays
it via the merchant.
And what have the "legitimate
! enterprises" in Palo Alto to fear
1 from outside competition? Their
i costs should be no higher, and they
| have i decided geographical advan
| tage.
If you look at this advertising
; question fairly, can't you see that
I it is just futile effort? By placing
| ;;n advertisement in the Daily (let
| us say) a merchant may stimulate
j his own business, but he does so at
i ihe expense of some other Palo Alto
j merchant. Then this second merch
' ant stimulates his business by put
! ting an ad in ihe Daily, .thus taking
| some business from a third . . . .
and so on The net result is
j higher prices with no increase in
! business in general, as I fear that
; those enrolled in Stanford spend
all the money that they bring here

anyway, advertising or no adver- !
tising.
I think that the only logical con- 1
elusion that can be drawn from all !
this is that (at least in this case) '
advertising is a powerful but waste- i
ful form of competition with which j
Ihe individual advertiser is unable >
to cope.
This waste will only be curbcd j
when the owner of advertising space I
realizes the foolishness of this sys- I
tem, and has courage and altruism
enough to do something about it. i
