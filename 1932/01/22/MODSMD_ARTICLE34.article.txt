Continuing once more in an ap
propriately spiritual vein, we beg ;
to expound:
I shall lift mine eves unto the I
Row, from whence cometh my
inspiration. My inspiration com- i
cth from the Greeks, which
made Heaven, Ilell, and several
other varieties of torture known
only to younger members of the
Five-Hundred, this morning.
After all, advice, congratulations,
criticism, and condolences are use
less palavering, after we've reached
tHis stage of the cutting-and-drying
process, because, (by geographical
progression):
The girls who went Chi
Omega are hound to become |
YWCA presidents, and live
across the street from the Phi
Delts;
Those who went D.G. will de- '
velop personality in LARGE doses,
and an acquired inhibition against
sleeping in anything less than a
triple-decker bed;
The ones who went Kappa
will take to brilliantincd scalp
locks, canoeing, and society
pages, ending up as the most
beautiful, most popular, most
intelligent ....
And the girls who went Theta
will develop violent, constant sus
picions that some other sorority is
doing a lot of dirty rushing;
The Alpha Phi fledglings will ,
quietly take afternoon tea at the
Cellar, until a likely looking son
of a famous novelist comes
along;
Those who went Pi Phi will auto- !
matically become members of the \
Rally Committee, whispering cam- 1
paigners, and devotees of the Pack- i
ard brigade;
The girls who climbed the
Gamma Phi hill are doomed to
long years of service cn The
Daily stall", and endanger the
health and sanity of the entire
community with puns, wise
cracks, puns, wisecracks . . .
The ones who went Tri Delt will '
becomo .... Tri Delts;
Those who went Alpha O will
have egg-nogs that are egg-nogs, J
become adept star-gazers, and even- |
tually get used to living behind a j
padlock;
The girls who went undecided |
will be constant menaces to sor- i
ority peace-of-mind for the rest
of the quarter;
And Our Famous Individualists!
will become Important Personages,
Women's Coucillors, Phi Betes, anti- j
Bonfirists, anti-pleasurists, anti
anti .... oh, well!
