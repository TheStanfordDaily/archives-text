# Frosh Quintet To Battle Bear Five Tomorrow Night
## RECORDS TO DATE FAVOR REDSHIRTS; CUB TEAM RANGY Injuries Fake Toll Among Yearlings As Sales Is Forced Out 
### Albert Guerard 
Another David and Goliath battle
goes' on the boards tomorrow night
when a small, speedy Stanford
freshman basketball team tackles a
quintet of California yearling giants
in the first game of' the annual
series between first-year teams of
the two schools. Comparative scores
point to a slight edge for the In
dians, but this will be offset by the
size of the Californians, none of
whom are small men like Lawry
Rotheri, Gordon Mallatratt, and
Frank Cox of the baby Redshirts.
The disabled list which threatens
to break up a fine varsity quintet,
has extended itself to Coach Vance
Fawcett':: freshmen. When the open
ing whistle sounds on Saturday
night, Tom Sales, regular center,
will not be on the floor, suffering
from a bad cold, while Lawry Roth
ert, although starting at a forward
post, will be badly handicapped by
a finger injury incurred in a recent
practice session.
Four Out of Six
Although victories of Stanford
varsity fives over Bear teams have
been few and far between, Indian
yearling quintets of the last decade
have enjoyed a marked superiority
over their Berkeley rivals. Four
times in the last six years, the
Little Big Series has ended in favor
of the Farm, and even money is
being offered that the 1932 season
will bring to Stanford the fifth
series victory.
Neither team has enjoyed a good
practice season record. Both teams
started poorly, and have shown
marked improvement as the season
progressed. Stanford suffered de
feats ac the hands of Palo Alto High,
Pittsburg High, and St. Mary's
freshman fives, and scored their one
victory over Stockton High.
Bears Rugged
The Bear Cubs lost to Stockton,
Lowell, and the Olympic Club
lightweights, but in their last two
starts beat out St. Ignatius High and
the Columbia Park Boys. Several
men, Dave Meeks, Joe Darracq, and
Jack Morgans, in particular, have
shown excellent ability, but team
work and handling of the ball has
been very lagged.
The Indians play three games
over the week-end. On Friday night,
at 8 o'clock, Fresno High will fur
nish the opposition to a reserve
team, although the best quintet may
enter the game for a few minutes
during the game. On Saturday af
ternoon, the reserves will again face
the Fresnans, and then the same
evening, the battle with California.
Forwards Chosen
The torrid struggle for forward
positions on Fawcett's five has been
won, temporarily at least, by Frank
Cox and Lawry Rothert, who will
start the game on Saturday night.
Tom Kelly at center, and Gordon
Mallatratt and Joe Butte, guards,
complete the starting five, but the
following combination will undoubt
edly see action during the week
end: Griswold, center, Page and
Coiner, forwards, Crowe, Savage,
and Meyer, guards.
Over at Berkeley the great im
provement shown by the Bear Cubs
has given their supporters confi
dence. Among the Stanford fresh
men a same spirit prevails, with a
result that the opening battle be
tween the two teams should prove
a torrid affair. Saturday night's
game will start at 6:30 o'clock.

start the game on Saturday night.
Tom Kelly at center, and Gordon
Mallatratt and Joe Butte, guards,
complete the starting five, but the
following combination will undoubt
edly see action during the week
end: Griswold, center, Page and
Coiner, forwards, Crowe, Savage,
and Meyer, guards.
Over at Berkeley the great im
provement shown by the Bear Cubs
has given their supporters confi
dence. Among the Stanford fresh
men a same spirit prevails, with a
result that the opening battle be
tween the two teams should prove
a torrid affair. Saturday night's
game will start at 6:30 o'clock.
Another David and Goliath battle
goes' on the boards tomorrow night
when a small, speedy Stanford
freshman basketball team tackles a
quintet of California yearling giants
in the first game of' the annual
series between first-year teams of
the two schools. Comparative scores
point to a slight edge for the In
dians, but this will be offset by the
size of the Californians, none of
whom are small men like Lawry
Rotheri, Gordon Mallatratt, and
Frank Cox of the baby Redshirts.
The disabled list which threatens
to break up a fine varsity quintet,
has extended itself to Coach Vance
Fawcett':: freshmen. When the open
ing whistle sounds on Saturday
night, Tom Sales, regular center,
will not be on the floor, suffering
from a bad cold, while Lawry Roth
ert, although starting at a forward
post, will be badly handicapped by
a finger injury incurred in a recent
practice session.
Four Out of Six
Although victories of Stanford
varsity fives over Bear teams have
been few and far between, Indian
yearling quintets of the last decade
have enjoyed a marked superiority
over their Berkeley rivals. Four
times in the last six years, the
Little Big Series has ended in favor
of the Farm, and even money is
being offered that the 1932 season
will bring to Stanford the fifth
series victory.
Neither team has enjoyed a good
practice season record. Both teams
started poorly, and have shown
marked improvement as the season
progressed. Stanford suffered de
feats ac the hands of Palo Alto High,
Pittsburg High, and St. Mary's
freshman fives, and scored their one
victory over Stockton High.
Bears Rugged
The Bear Cubs lost to Stockton,
Lowell, and the Olympic Club
lightweights, but in their last two
starts beat out St. Ignatius High and
the Columbia Park Boys. Several
men, Dave Meeks, Joe Darracq, and
Jack Morgans, in particular, have
shown excellent ability, but team
work and handling of the ball has
been very lagged.
The Indians play three games
over the week-end. On Friday night,
at 8 o'clock, Fresno High will fur
nish the opposition to a reserve
team, although the best quintet may
enter the game for a few minutes
during the game. On Saturday af
ternoon, the reserves will again face
the Fresnans, and then the same
evening, the battle with California.
Forwards Chosen
The torrid struggle for forward
positions on Fawcett's five has been
won, temporarily at least, by Frank
Cox and Lawry Rothert, who will
start the game on Saturday night.
