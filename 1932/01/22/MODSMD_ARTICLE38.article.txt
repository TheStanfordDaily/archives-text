# Shires, Cocky, Knows He's Good and Makes 'Em Like It With Errorless Ball at First Sack
## 
### 
Now that Arthur "Whataman"
Shires has come back to the majors
—as he promised he would, we may
expect a lot of colorful stories to
emanate from the Braves training
camp next spring. The Great Man
is not only a good ballplayer but he
is certainly soaked through and
through with color. An enlarged ego
leads Mr. Shires to announce in a
loud voice, "Me, I'm good!," then
he proceeds to prove it. (Well, most
of the time!). I like a guy like that,
for how can you expect anyone else
to think you're good unless you
think so yourself? So why not men
tion the fact, provided you can back
it up with deeds. The Joie Rays and
the Jack Sharkeys and the Ar{
Shires's add a lot to the gaiety of
nations.
Shires, playing first base for Mil
waukee last season, proved that he
was "tco good a ballplayer for the
minor leagues (those were his own
words), and led the American As
sociation in batting with an average
of .385. "Whataman" socked out 240
safe hits, including 45 doubles, eight

| triples, and eleven homers. Just as
he had said (modestly), when the
Washington Senators had sent him
1 to Milwaukee, "I'll show up this
league, and I'll be back in the ma-
I jors next year. These pitchers can't
; stop me!" Well, they couldn't evi
: dently, so he's back, as a teammate
i of the very colorful Rabbit Maran
ville and the baldheaded Mr.
Spohror, whom he once knocked
! out in four rounds in a fight in
Boston.
It's easy to remember the pugna
cious Shires as a member of the
White Sox, when he beat up his
manager, Russell (Lena) Blaek
burne, bit Secretary*Lou Barbour's
finger and was fined and suspended
by Harry Grabiner. These were the
days, ail right, with Shires fighting
ring battles all over the place and
Judge Landis telling him to stop,
because baseball and boxing didn't
mix. (As though they never rented
ball parks for prize fights!) But the
Great One is back now, so the turn
| stiles ought to click merrily in 1932
provided Arthur Shires clicks as
I first baseman for the Braves.

is not only a good ballplayer but he
is certainly soaked through and
through with color. An enlarged ego
leads Mr. Shires to announce in a
loud voice, "Me, I'm good!," then
he proceeds to prove it. (Well, most
of the time!). I like a guy like that,
for how can you expect anyone else
to think you're good unless you
think so yourself? So why not men
tion the fact, provided you can back
it up with deeds. The Joie Rays and
the Jack Sharkeys and the Ar{
Shires's add a lot to the gaiety of
nations.
Shires, playing first base for Mil
waukee last season, proved that he
was "tco good a ballplayer for the
minor leagues (those were his own
words), and led the American As
sociation in batting with an average
of .385. "Whataman" socked out 240
safe hits, including 45 doubles, eight

| triples, and eleven homers. Just as
he had said (modestly), when the
Washington Senators had sent him
1 to Milwaukee, "I'll show up this
league, and I'll be back in the ma-
I jors next year. These pitchers can't
; stop me!" Well, they couldn't evi
: dently, so he's back, as a teammate
i of the very colorful Rabbit Maran
ville and the baldheaded Mr.
Spohror, whom he once knocked
! out in four rounds in a fight in
Boston.
It's easy to remember the pugna
cious Shires as a member of the
White Sox, when he beat up his
manager, Russell (Lena) Blaek
burne, bit Secretary*Lou Barbour's
finger and was fined and suspended
by Harry Grabiner. These were the
days, ail right, with Shires fighting
ring battles all over the place and
Judge Landis telling him to stop,
because baseball and boxing didn't
mix. (As though they never rented
ball parks for prize fights!) But the
Great One is back now, so the turn
| stiles ought to click merrily in 1932
provided Arthur Shires clicks as
I first baseman for the Braves.
Now that Arthur "Whataman"
Shires has come back to the majors
—as he promised he would, we may
expect a lot of colorful stories to
emanate from the Braves training
camp next spring. The Great Man
is not only a good ballplayer but he
is certainly soaked through and
