# FENCERS TO REVEAL POWERS AT FIRST PRE-OLYMPIC MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's promising fencing team
will have its first chance to try and
live up to pre-season expectations
this evening when it enters the first
of the pre-Olympic meets sponsored
by the A.F.L.A. This evening's en
counters are to determine the open
individual and team saber cham
pionship of the Bay region, and the
winners will be eligible for the
Pacific Coast finals.
The meet will start at 3 o'clock in
the.main basketball floor of the En
citfa Gym, J,and admission is free to
the gdheral public. Although no
definite entries have been received,
it is probable that California will
send a team, while the Olympic
Club and Stanford are certain to
enter squads. Unattached individual
fencers of the Bay region will prob
ably also compete.
The Olympic Club won the team
title last year, but the Indian trio
of Captain Leonard Pockman, Jim
Reed, and Tom Pockman has a line
chance to win this year. All three
of these men are also good enough
to be given serious consideration for
the individual saber championship.
No referees have as yet been cho
sen, and there is a possibility that
the contestants, who are not fenc
ing at the time, will officiate.
