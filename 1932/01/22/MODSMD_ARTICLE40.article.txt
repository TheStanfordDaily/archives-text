# EIGHT POLO PLAYERS MOVED TO 'B' SQUAD
## 
### 
Eight new players were promoted
to the B squad of the Cardinal polo
team yesterday by Coach Gordan.
They are Derby, Enieis, Enemark,
Williamson, Keerl, Lairn, Statter,
and Keyes.
Ordinarily so many advancements
are not made as early in the year,
but Captain Gordan considers these
men have shown unusual improve
ment as beginniners and are quite
worthy of berlhs on the B squad.
Along with the above promotions,
Adams and Mayer, formerly on {he
B sqund, were moved up to the
faster competition of the A squad.
