# NEVERS' GRIDDERS GO TO KEZAR FOR FINAL WORKOUTS
## Great Fullback Refuses To Comment On Chances Against Carideo 
### 
Ernie Nevers and his National j
Collegians wound up practicing on !
the campus grid field last night in j
preparation for Sunday's charity !
game at Kezar stadium, but Nevers
refused to say anything concerning
his team's chances against the squad j
which Frank Carideo is now organ- i
izing in San Francisco.
Although Ernie confessed that his |
men had had more experience play- j
ing together, he believed that Cari
deo's team, trained in Notre Dame
plays, would be functioning as a
unit by Sunday. Following the |
Collegians' impressive 14-0 win over i
the U.S.C. All-Stars last week in j
Los Angeles, however, they have j
been generally installed as favorites '
for the charity tussle.
Carideo, who like Nevers, is one 1
of football's all-time "greats," has j
an imposing list of former Notre j
Dame and St. Mary's stars on his j
roster, in addition to Rusty Gill and i
Ted Beckett of California. Men like j
these must be reckoned with, and j
it is on individual superiority that i
Carideo is basing his chief hope of j
victory.
Those who have seen the Colle- :
gians in action, however, claim that |
Nevers' eleven is superior on a |
"man to man" basis also, what with
a line which averages over two 1
hundred pounds, and a fast and
powerful backfield with the former !
Stanford fullback playing the lead- j
ing role and calling signals. Nevers'
kicking ability has made itself even
more evident in recent years, and
it is no unusual sight to see a ball
stay in the air seventy yards after
making contact with his educated
and well-trained toe.
