SHANGHAI, China, Jan. 21 (VP). —
Japan has dispatched an aircraft car
rier, four destroyers and a special
landing party to Shanghai as a re
sult of clashes between Japanese and
Chinese here, Tokyo dispatches said
today.
Meanwhile extraordinary precau
tions were taken by the authorities
of the international settlement to
prevent another outburst similar to
yesterday's fight in which two per
sons were killed and many wounded.
The Tokyo dispatches said that in
addition to the force already ordered
to Shanghai, other naval craft were
•held at the Japanese base at Sasebo
for quick movement to Shanghai in
case of necessity.
