Just one year ago tomorrow night j
John Bunn took his first Stanford j
basketball squad over to the Oak- .
land auditorium to defeat the Cali
fornia Bears for the first time since
1925. The following two contests of
the Big Game series, however, went
to the Bears.
Tomorrow night the .1932 edition
of the Card basketball team faces
the Bears with once again a "fight
ing" chance to upset the Bear in
two of the three contests, which
would be the first series taken by ,
the Redshirts in six years.
Unfortunately the Indian will
be handicapped l»y injuries but
that did not prevent him last
week from giving one of the
best performances of his life |
against the Terrible Trojans
from Southern California.
One of the injuries, however,
is going to be severely felt, and i
that is the loss of dynamic "Tiny
Tom"' Cordry. It will be recalled • i
that Cordry was chiefly re
sponsible for Stanford's lone
victory last year. The Indians
conquered the Bears with
Cordry running all over the
Oakland auditorium to display
probably the best floorwork yet
seen in Stanford basketball. And
in the extra session necessary
to decide the tilt Cordry put
the game on ice with two field %
goals. The final score was Stan- i

ford 37, California 32.
•♦ < •
Without Cordry in tomorrow's
contest this responsibility will fall
upon "Frenchy" LaCombe and Jack
Cosgrove. LaCombe of course has
already proved himself capable by
garnering more than 10 points
against any competition thus far to
face the Indians. Cosgrove has not
played very much this season but
has the advantage of having once
been LaCombe's teammate at
I Menlo J.C.
Sunday afternoon Bay foot
ball tuns will once again have
an opportunity to see Stanford's
Ernie Ncvers perform on the
gridiron when the blond giant
leads his squad of "National
CollegiaCes" against Frank Cari
deo's All-Stars in a charity
game at Kezar Stadium.
I Nevers and his outfit took a cou
ple of workouts on the varsity foot
! ball field here during the week and
if the former Card fUllback looks as
| good Sunday as he did in practice,
the game will be well worth seeing.
Although it has been six years since
i Nevers has been in college competi
tion as Pop Warner's All-Time All —
; American fullback, the Card ace
1 still punts, passes, and runs like an
All-American. Nevers is today eon
sidered the best backfield man in
' professional football.

Just one year ago tomorrow night j
John Bunn took his first Stanford j
basketball squad over to the Oak- .
land auditorium to defeat the Cali
fornia Bears for the first time since
1925. The following two contests of
the Big Game series, however, went
to the Bears.
Tomorrow night the .1932 edition
of the Card basketball team faces
the Bears with once again a "fight
ing" chance to upset the Bear in
two of the three contests, which
would be the first series taken by ,
the Redshirts in six years.
Unfortunately the Indian will
be handicapped l»y injuries but
that did not prevent him last
week from giving one of the
best performances of his life |
against the Terrible Trojans
from Southern California.
One of the injuries, however,
is going to be severely felt, and i
that is the loss of dynamic "Tiny
Tom"' Cordry. It will be recalled • i
that Cordry was chiefly re
sponsible for Stanford's lone
victory last year. The Indians
conquered the Bears with
Cordry running all over the
Oakland auditorium to display
probably the best floorwork yet
seen in Stanford basketball. And
in the extra session necessary
to decide the tilt Cordry put
the game on ice with two field %
goals. The final score was Stan- i

ford 37, California 32.
•♦ < •
Without Cordry in tomorrow's
contest this responsibility will fall
upon "Frenchy" LaCombe and Jack
Cosgrove. LaCombe of course has
already proved himself capable by
garnering more than 10 points
against any competition thus far to
face the Indians. Cosgrove has not
played very much this season but
has the advantage of having once
been LaCombe's teammate at
I Menlo J.C.
Sunday afternoon Bay foot
ball tuns will once again have
an opportunity to see Stanford's
Ernie Ncvers perform on the
gridiron when the blond giant
leads his squad of "National
CollegiaCes" against Frank Cari
deo's All-Stars in a charity
game at Kezar Stadium.
