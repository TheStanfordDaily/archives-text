More than two hundred thirty i
pounds of football brain and brawn, j
answering to the name of George j
Christensen, thundered into the j
dressing room after a stiff workout j
Wednesday on one of Stanford's j
practice fields. For three years I
"Chris" seasonally inhabited Pacific !
Coast gridirons. His official colors !
were the University of Oregon's j
green and lemon, but now this j
mammoth gentleman draws his pay .
check from the Portsmouth, Ohio, ,
Spartans.
"Chris" does not claim to be a ,
veteran professional, having had j
only a year of lucrative ball. The j
Great Ernie Nevers has recently j
brought him back to the coast in j
order to play tackle in the Knights
of Columbus Charity Game in San j
Francisco, Sunday afternoon.
When asked if he might be in- j
terviewed, Mr. Christensen's genial J
answer was, "Sure, but give me a j
cigarette first. You see, we train in \
pro-ball but not the same way as i
_

they do in intercollegiate ball."
"Chris's" love for the game took
him into the professional ranks
where he claims that the game is
more mature, played by experienced
men, and affords a decent living.
"Competition is tougher, practically
no dirty playing goes on, and a
feeling of good sportsmanship pre
vails. We work for effect, and do
not waste energy. For about three
weeks we took two workouts a day,
and always keep in condition. We
are allowed to smoke, but hard li
quor is tabooed."
Jess Tinsley, Louisiana State, ex
' 29, a player from the Cardinal
squad, agreed with Christensen on
every statement, adding, "Profes
sional players seldom get hurt, and
believe me, they have plenty of
guts."
The two men coincided in their
belief that Carideo's team would
lose the game by touchdowns be
cause, "There are too many boys
that are anxious to show their wares
in their own backyard."
"Professional football gives the
old stars a beating, as a rule. Young
fellows get the chance of their lives

when they can tackle men like Red
Grange. I know," said Christensen,
"I'd read of him for years, but what
I'd always wanted to do was to
tackle him. I did a few times this
year. Everyone agrees he had his
best year during the past season."
