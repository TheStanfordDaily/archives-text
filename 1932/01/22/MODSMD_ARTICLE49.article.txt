# ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE BROKE, ASKS FUNDS
## 
### 
WESTERVILLE, Ohio. Jan. 20.â€” ;
The Anti-Saloon League of America j
is almost and there is gloom '
in this town, the birthplace of the !
league and the home of its national i
headquarters, for officials realize it |
will be courting disaster to be short j
of funds on the eve of a national j
political campaign.
An appeal was sent out from ;
headquarters to the "faith- j
ful," pointing out the necessity for |
funds to combat the foes of prohi- |
bition and asking them to contribute j
immediately.
