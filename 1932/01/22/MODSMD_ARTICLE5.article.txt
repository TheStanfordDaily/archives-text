LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21. (/P> â€”
Henry M. Robinson, internationally
known economist and Los Angeles
banker, appealed to America's
bankers today to "pay more atten
tion 10 our domestic affairs" in an
address at the annual stockholders
meeting of the Security National
Bank.'
Robinson, who held important
economic positions under two na
tional administrations and who is a
warm friend of President Hoover,
said: "We must not overestimate the
importance of our foreign business
nor give too much weight to the
international debts nor to foreign
situations generally."
