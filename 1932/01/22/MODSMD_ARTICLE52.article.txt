# REDSKIN NINE TO TACKLE OLYMPIC CLUB TOMORROW
## 
### 
Boasting a team that includes five !
of the lettermen from last year's
championship outfit, three sopho- 1
mores and a junior in the starting !
line-up, Coach Harry Wolter will '
send Ins 1932 edition of the Indian j
nine against the Olympic Club to
morrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Following a stiff Workout last
night, Coach Wolter announced a
tentative line-up that will in all |
probability see many changes before j
the "Winged O" outfit packs its bats '
back to the big city. The field is
well taken care of with two veter- j
ans in right and center, plus a i
wealth of material to fill in the hole |
left by the graduation of last year's
captain, Johnny Hunken, who held
down the left field position for three
consecutive seasons.
In the infield, however, the veter
an mentor is having his troubles
trying to find even fair substitutes
lor "Spud" Hardy and Dykes John
son, who have played their last sea
sons lor Stanford at first and third,
respectively.
The most likely smarter at the ini
tial sack is a youngster who filled
the position quite capably for last
year's freshman outfit, Art Hearn.
He has the advantage of an excel
lent arm, a good eye, and a lot of
potential ability. With the added ex
perience that he will get under
Welter's careful tutelage, he ought
to be around when the Indians go
after the rest of the conference
tribes. If Hearn shows signs of get
ting shaky, he will be followed by
Fred Goodell, varsity first-sacker
two y3ars ago.
Over in the hot corner, Wolter has

\ another likely sophomore, Jerry
Trautman, better known as a golfer
1 than as an exponent of the great
| national partime. However, he has
' one of the smoothest throwing arms
| seen on the squad in some time,
and under fire he may prove to be
the man wanted to fill Johnson's va
-1 cated shoes. If he doesn't, he will be
followed by another sophomore, Bob
Maentz, who played short last year.
\ In left field Coach Woltcr is start-
I ing last year's sensational freshman
i fly chaser, "Lefty" Goldman, and
! if pre-season form means anything
! he ought to'feel right at home.
The lest of the line-up is as an
| nounccd yesterday, with Livermore
catching Bob Estes, Vince Philippi
, on second, Delmas at short, Rintaia
in center field, and Campbell in
| right.
