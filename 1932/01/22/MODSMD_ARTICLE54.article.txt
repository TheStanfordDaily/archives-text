# FARM LOOKS GOOD TO BROWN AFTER STUDENT CONFAB
## President Impressed By Failure Of Proctor Idea Elsewhere 
### Joseph Endert 
Comparatively admirable success
of the Honor Code, a commendable
lack of political activity, and a well
organized board of athletic~"control
â€” are some of the most praise
worthy elements of Stanford life
brought to Robert M. Brown's at
tention when he compared Stanford
with other American universities
during his attendance at the recent
National Students' Federation of
America convention at Toledo, Ohio.
Brown, student body president,
attended the meet as Stanford's
delegate.
Fail to Report
"I wr.s particularly impressed,"
Blown said, "by the non-success of
the proctor system at those schools
which use it. That, of course, is
what Stanford would be forced to
udopt if we ever throw over the
Honor Code. The proctors, whether
students or faculty members, fail to
report cheating, and examinations
in many cases are nothing more
than cheating marathons.
"Stanford's reputation in ttye East
it one of successful Honor Code
operation. Some schools are on the
verge of discarding their honor sys
tems because of poor administration,
politics, and disinclination of stu
dents to report violations. Others
find the honor idea very worthwhile
and workable.
"Among the schools which are
best satisfied with the honor sys
tem, those predominate which have
appointive councils. I believe Stati
-1 ord's procedure of electing its
council should be changed to ap
pointment of three members for a
year's teim by the outgoing student
body president, and appointment of
the other two by the incoming
president. In my opinion, this would
eliminate any possibility of political
'trading.'"
B.A.C. Praised
Brown said the majority of dele
gates to the meeting approved
highly of Stanford's Board of Ath
letic Control organization, which
provides for student, faculty, and
alumni representation, each sharing
; third of the total membership.
Commenting on a recent election
at the University of Colorado,
Brown said that university build
ings had been painted as part of a
demonstration, and that election
conditions there had become so bad
that the student body president is
now appointed by the head of the
university. Brown declared, ''Judg
ing from conditions at other uni
versities, I should say that we are
very fortunate in having so little
political maneuvering on this cam
pus."
