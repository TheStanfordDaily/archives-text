# ALLEN TO FEATURE LISZT COMPOSITION IN SUNDAY RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen will use the com
| positions which he played last in
; his recital yesterday as the basis for
I his recital Sunday at 4 o'clock in
: the Stanford Memorial Church.
Probably the outstanding num- 1
, ber of the program will be "Fan
| tasia and Fugue" by Franz Liszt, i
' This was written on the choral "Ad !
j nor salutarem undam," sung in Act
, 111, "Le Prophete," and was pro
! nounced by Saint-Saens to be "the
| most extraordinary piece ever writ- |
! ten for organ." In it one finds the j
j same lomantic imagery and dra- j
; matic power that made the creator j
I of the symbolic poem so helpful to
I Wagner. The work originally is of
j great length, and consequently the;
| fantasia will be presented in an
' abridged farm.
The entire program will be made j
| up of the following numbers:
Three Chorale-Preludes on "In
dulci jubilo" Bach
a. Maestoso
b. Trio
c. Double Canon Cradle Song
Alia Siei liana Handel
By th? Sea Franz Schubert
Serenade Franz Schubert !
| Fantasia and Fugue... .Franz Liszt
