# HOOVER TURNS ATTENTION TO CLOSED BANKS
## Legislation For Relief Of Depositors Pending As Bills Are Offered DELIBERATIONS BEGUN Finance Corporation Being Mobilized Rapidly 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. </P) —
President Hoover turned today to
the next step in the emergency
program—legislation for relief of
depositors of closed banks.
Meanwhile, mobilization of the
new gigantic reconstruction finance
corporation proceeded rapidly.
An understanding was reached at
a White House breakfast between
the President, Senator Watson of
Indiana, and Representative Snell
of New York, the Republican floor
leaders, to press for congressional
authority for an organization to
speed payments for depositors in
closed banks.
Two Bills Offered
Two bills providing for this ac
tion are well along in congressional
deliberations. That of Senator Glass,
Democrat, Virginia, for revision of
the banking system, provides for a
liquidating corporation. The admin
istration has a measure sponsored
by Senator Thomas, Republican,
Idaho, for a similar $150,000,000 or
ganization.
Every energy was being directed,
meanwhile, by the administration to
put into operation the titanic re
construction corporation established
last week by Congress.
$350,000,000 Issued
Secretary Mellon announced an
issue of $350,000,000 in Treasury
certificates. Of this sum, $290,000,000
is for meeting the initial needs of
the two billion dollar credit agency.
Tomorrow President Hoover will
forward to the Senate for confirma
tion some, if not all, of his nominees
for the four directorates of the cor
poration. These will include the
name of Charles G. Dawes, who al
ready has taken command of the
business-stimulating organization.
The ether three to be chosen by
ihe President must be Democrats,
and he has met some difficulty in
these selections. Thfey must come
from separate Federal Reserve dis
tricts, and most of the names rec
ommended to Mr. Hoover are from
the South.
