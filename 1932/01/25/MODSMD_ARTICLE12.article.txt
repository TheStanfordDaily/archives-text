# CASTLE CLUB WINS OVER CARD CHESS MEN BY 6-1 COUNT
## 
### 
Recovering from a 6-1 defeat at
(he hands of the Castle Chess Club
of Oakland last Friday night, the
Stanford chessmen begin an exten- ,
sive two-weeks practice before !
iheir big match with California on i
February 5.
Last week's decisive setback was I
expected, and Winston Strong, club j
president, thought that the Cardinal J
L,.oup did well in making every :
match a ; ; interesting as it was. Sev- I
cral contests would have ended in j
tics had it not been for an extension I
of time which is not ordinarily j
granted.
Joe Mendelson was the only Stan- ]
ford man to win a match. He de
feated Olshousen of the Oakland I
club. On the other hand, Bob i
Myers, Winston Strong, Ed Fisher,
Henry McCully, Wilson Harwood, j
and Don Kennedy lost to members '
of the Castle Club team.
