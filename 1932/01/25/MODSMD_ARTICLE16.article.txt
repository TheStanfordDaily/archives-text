### HARRISON FOSS 
"Coriolanus" wins first choicc as j
! the Shakespeare play best suited to ;
, campus production, Harold Helven- j
: ston and Frederick Stover draw;
praise, and James Lyons and James j
! Sandoe rate as topnotch student
| actors in a recent interview granted j
by Dr. Margery Bailey, of the Eng
lish department.
"The plot of 'Coriolanus' — the I
i struggle of one man against the j
mob—inclines it toward modern :
production," Dr. Bailey suggests. To j
find an actor capable of taking the I
chief role would be Helvenston's 1
! main problem if the play were un- !
: dertaken, she says.
Helvenston, director of Stanford j
dramatics, and Stover, stage techni- '
cian, tome in for ample credit for |
I their work here during the last j
three years.—"During which the ,
Stanford stage has advanced far," i
according to Dr. Bailey. The Palo i
Alto Community Playhouse is be- ;
1 coming a useful operative in the j
development of campus talent, she |
j points out, by more and more stu- j

dents who are mounting the Paly |
stage.
Singling out two players in the
coming production of "Bird in !
Hand," Dr. Bailey calls James j
Lyons one of the most powerful ac
tors she has seen on the amateur j
stage. Sandoe, sfie says, is excellent |
by his use of restrained action, a
clear sense of pause effects, the'
nuances of comedy and the art of
timing. Her comment is based on
Lyons' work in "Wings Over Eu
rope," and Sandoe's parts in the
recent "Berkeley Square," and "Ten
Nights" al the Palo Alto playhouse.
Dr. Bailey is to appear as ihe
hateful Mrs. Phelps, leading role in
"The Silver Cord," scheduled for
production at the Community Play- !
house early in February. This is a
comedy whose whole eifect is so
harsh as to be serious. Four of the
cast of five arc drawn from the
campus. Besides Dr, B iley, there
are Vivienne Church, Robert
Brauns, Richard Ogg, and Peg Ran
dall Converse.
