# Hyde Declares Post-war Loans Made Illegally
## Secretaray Produces Government Documents to Show $2,000,000,000 Was Sent to U.S. Allies Without Approval of Congress 
### 
W ASIIINGTON, Jan. 21. (/V)—Secretaray Hyde today turned the leaves
of aging government documents to present support for his charges
that President Wilson's administration made post-war loans to Europe
without legal authority. Pointing to printed page and paragraph, he
answered Senator Glass's description of his original charges as "a mali
cious fabrication" with a word picture designed to show that nearly
$2,000,000,000 was sent to the war-torn Allies although Congress had
denied approval of permissive legislation. The Republican Cabinet member
quoted the statements of Senator Glass, Sccrctaary of the Treasury at
the end of the Wilson regime, and his predecessor, William G. McAdoo,
in seeking legislation "extending the authority to establish credits in
favor of foreign governments."

He quoted McAdoo as saying: "We
have no power to consider such
loans now. We have no authority
to make such loans."
"Secretary Hyde first made his ac
cusations in speeches in which he
confidently predicted re-election of
President Hoover. Senator Glass re
plied heatedly on the Senate floor,
saying they were "false in spirit and
in fact."
"There isn't a word of truth in
it," the Virginian said, "and the
Secretary of Agriculture might eas
ily have ascertained the facts had he
been as cautious to observe the
truth as he was swift to misrepre
sent the facts."
Hyde said the point he was stress
ing was that, nearly all of America's
"delicate economic and political
questions have grown out of the war
or have been enhanced by it," and
that Mr. Hoover was not responsible
for the loans made after the war.
