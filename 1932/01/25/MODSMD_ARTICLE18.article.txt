### 
Originality and skill give the
current exhibits at the Stanford Ail
Gallery unusual interest. Seward H.
Rathbun, whose wife is the daugh
ter of Professor Emeritus Bailey
Willis, recalls the days of the padres
in water colors' of the missions.
One painting, perhaps the most
impressive, is •called "God for the
Indian" and depicts the powerful
bronzed figure of an Indian kneel
ing before the altar, bathed in a pool
of golden sunlight streaming through
the stained glass window.
In a different mood the artist de
picts ihe grotesque symbols of Alas
kan totems, the garish colors stand
ing out from the sombre forest
background. His cacti in the glar
ing light of the desert also show the
ease with which he obtains vivid
effects.
A second exhibit consists of the
photographs of Edward Weston of
Carmel, who shows his artistic skill
in presenting common things in new
and strange lights. Curious, even
beautiful effects of light and shade
arc revealed in peppers, cabbages,
bananas, rocks, and sea shells. Often
but a portion of the object, a few
inches of a cliff, the stem of a clump
of bananas, are shown, but this
small part has been photographed in
great detail.
