# PARABLE IS SUBJECT OF BISHOP'S SERMON
## 
### 
The Reverend Wm. F. Faber, D.D.,
Bishop of Montana, took the 201 h
chapter of Matthew for the subject
of his sermon yesterday morning in
the Stanford Memorial Church.
He took the familiar parable of
the householder and the laborers,
and applied the cultivation of the
vines to the cultivation of truth, jus
tice and goodwill. Like the work of
the laborers, the cultivation of these
qualities requires no skilled labor,
for even the smallest child can de
velop these qualities as successfully
as any adult.
