## Frenchy LaCombe, High-Point Card Player, Held To One Field Goal PLAY ROUGH BUT CLEAN Defense Of Both Quintets Proves Rugged

A big, fast California basketball
five, showing some 1 of the expected
power that was lacking in early
season games moved hack into the
conference race Saturday night by
defeating the Stanford quintet, 2f»
to 19.
It wins «a hard-fought battle,
marked by rough but not dirty play.
Smothering the guns of Frenchy
LaCombe, who could collect only
one field goal all evening, ihe Bears
held the Indians in check for most
ox the game. Stanford, meanwhile,
kept a close watch on Kintana and
Eifert, the Berkeley scoring ace«,
but they netted seven points apiece
while then teammates were garner
ing other tallies to sew up the game.
Up-Hill Battle
The Indians, handicapped by in
juries 'o several players, including
"Tiny Tom*' Cordry, waged an up
hill fight all the way. After La-
Combe's free throw put Stanford
ahead temporarily, 1 to 0, the Bears
opened up to run up a (J to 2 lead
before the Indians could sink a field
goal. Cosgrove's bucket half way
through the period, followed by a
field goal and free try by Packard
and another of the latter by La-
Combe made the score 8 to 6, and
again Stanford was in the lead.
It was at this point that Eifert,
forward, and Johnson, guard, were
inserted into the game by Nibs
Price, and the California Bear be
gan tf> go places. Two baskets by
Johnson, a bucket and a free throw
by Eifert, and a field goal by Read
put the Berkeley five well ahead, 15
to 8, at half time.
Indians Rally
Twice Stanford rallied in the sec
end period, and both times the Bears
were equal to the occasion. Nor
gard, Lacombe, and Hancock found
the basket in quick succession to
knot the score at 15 to IS, but Kin
tana and Eifert put California back
into a 20 to 15 lead half way through
the period.
Again the Indians started out
after Bear meat, but Ihe Golden
beast was 100 elusive. There was
still hope, when with two minutes
left to play, Stanford trailed by only
three points, 22 to J9.
Cough la n Scores
After a flurry under the Califor
nia basket, it was Joe Coughlan who
settled the issue with a field goal
after the Bears had drawn out the
Indian defense with a stall. Ohashi
capped the climax with a free throw
to make the final score 25 to 19.
Both teams presented rugged de
