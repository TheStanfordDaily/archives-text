# THE 						UNSEEN DANGER

### 
There is a university regulation prohibiting outside so
lieitors from operating on the Stanford campus without the
approval of the administration, hut it is difficult of enforce
ment unless it lias the co-operation of every student.
Whenever an as^eill calls, il is advisable to notify the cam
pus oflicers. If the solicitor is genuine and aboveboard,
working wiin the approval of the administration, he will
welcome ollieial prooi of nis good standing. If he is
crooked, the sooner he is discovered, the better.
When there is unlimited access to houses and living
groups on the campus, there is opportunity for the un
scrupulous to familiarize themselves with the habits of
the students and to "get the layout," returning later when
the houses are unoccupied to secure their loot and make a
getaway unmolested. This very thing has happened here.
In some cases, investigation has shown some of the "sales
men" to be spurious and without suitable explanation for
their presence on the campus.
Transient solicitors, here today and gone tomorrow,
can engage in fraudulent practices with the chances of
being apprehended reduced io the minimum. A case in
point occurred over the week-end when the "representa
tives" of a certain widely circulated magazine worked En
eina and Toyon. A checkup revealed that they had no
connection with tin 4 magazine for which they were sup
posed to be selling subscriptions. This is one of the few
times that the so-called agents have been caught.
There is another phase of the matter which ought to be
considered. A large number of the students on this campus
are self-supporting, wholly or in part, and their income is
augmented by agencies of various kinds, which in their
entirely, cover nearly every line of articles that can be de
sired by prospective purchasers.
To patronize the "home industry" can serve two pur
poses: Il will aid the needy student and at the same time
reduce an unseen danger lo the vanishing point.
