In Friday's issue of the Daily 1 it>l) Brown, president of
the A.S.S.t'., in an interview remarked on the feasibility
of having the Men's Council, which is now elective, ap
pointed. He said, "Among the schools which are hest satis
lied with the honor system, those predominate which have
appointive councils. I believe Stanford's procedure of
electing its council should be changed to appointment of
three members for a year's term by the outgoing student
body president, and appointment of the other two by the
incoming president. In my opinion, this would eliminate
any possibility of political 'trading'."
Although Brown says that this system has worked well
at other schools, it hardly seems logical that changing the
council into an appointive body would eliminate the diffi
culties now present in the application of the Honor (lode.
It also appears that political bargaining would be more
easily accomplished if the council were appointed than
when it is elected bv the student body.
If the incoming and outgoing presidents were of differ
ent opinions on the matter, the resulting council appointed
jointly by the two presidents would accomplish about as
much as a Lame Duck session of Congress.
It is true that these objections are only provisional and
might possibly be eliminated; but making the council ap
pointive which would result in such a great centralization
of power should only follow careful consideration of its
results.
