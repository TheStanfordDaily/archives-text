# CHI PSI MASCOT, FIGHTING MUTT, MISSING 4 DAYS
## 
### 
Hinting at the possibility that
life is anything but peaceful at
the Lodge, the Chi Psi's report
that their Airedale mascot,
Pal, is missing.
Pal, who was entering upon
his ninth straight winter as the
Lodge leader, was last seen
three or four days ago, and
although it was at first thought
that he had merely embarked
on an extended tour of discov
ery, it is now feared that he
may have been the victim of
foul play.
He is fat and friendly, but
does not make it a practice to
follow strangers. Although he
walks around with his head
down, he can be counted upon
to get at least a draw out of
most fights. His rather nonde
script collar is characterized
by a dab of green paint on the
name-plate.
The Chi Psi's would appre
ciate any news of their pet
pooch.
