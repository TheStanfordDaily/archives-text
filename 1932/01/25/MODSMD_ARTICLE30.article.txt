Over there l>y the (icologv corner is a fire hydrant
around which every day are clustered numbers of parked
cars. If it should become necessary to connect a hose to
that hydrant in a hurry, il is easy to believe that there
would be considerable delay; delay which might be very
< xpensiv*.
In the same area, 100, there is not enough care exercised
in parking with the convenience of the other fellow in
mind and, as ;i result, a number of cars are effectively
"boxed."
These infractions of the Iraflic rules, while lliev seem
minor in character, may lea' 1 !o serious consequences and
with lluil idea in mind, the campus olUcers have indicated
their willingness to "pinch" the violators.
