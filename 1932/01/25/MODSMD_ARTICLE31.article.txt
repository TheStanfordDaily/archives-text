# BULL SESSION
## SUPER-SPECIALIZATION 
### 
Revelations are interesting; and
revelations as to our own brilliance
or ignorance are apt to be especially
interesting. Those that wish to be
revealed should read a little book
just out entitled "Quiz Yourself."
We don't know the publisher, the
author, and we are not taking or
ders—and still we think it's a good
book. It. consists of a long list of
general questions testing how many
facts we have been able to absorb
during our many days on this
earth. To those who do not wish to
deflate tho ego in public, we advise
reading the book behind locked
doors and in the thickest secrecy.
To those that think it is undesirable
to suppress—or who delight in
showing off their soul with its vices
and virtues, drag out this little
booklet and go to work.

This group of questions—or any
group consisting of material from
all the fields of knowledge—would
reveal that college students and
probably many professors too are
hopelessly one-sided. Students spe
cialize. Ford workers learn one
small operation to perfection; and
most of us are willing to do the
same with our education. That is, >
minus the perfection. One student j
specializing in "International Rela- j
tions" did not know for how long j
Senators are elected. Students in j
one sphere of history often are I
hopelessly shy on related times— j
even those periods a couple of cen- j
turies away from their "field." j
Probably, the saddest cases are*!

those who are majoring in natural
science. They fullill the few Uni
versity requirements, and then hot
foot it to their laboratories with all
the speed they can muster, there to
vegetate until a bit of sheepskin
tells them they are ready to enter
the world as educated men.

The same super-specialization goes
on among the faculty. Professors
often shock their classes into the
startling realization that all that
lectures is not educational gold—or
even •» good alloy. When, somehow
Ihe class discussion breaks away
from the exact subject, many an in
structor beats back to "His Field"
in embarrassed haste. The profes
sors who can temper their exact
knowledge with a general education
are interesting and Worthwhile.
They can put their subject over to
the student.

Professors and students are just
part of tlie environment, however,
lt'.s our age. The Jack-of-all-Trades
is doomed and education has fol
lowed suit rather than compensat
ing for what seems like an inevit
able economic situation which
forces us all into little niches—there
to keep us forever and ever. It may
be an unfortunate necessity for pre
med students to gorge themselves
almost exclusively on natural sci
ence, but for the University to al
low students who are here just for
a degree, or pre-legal, or business,
1o become specialists in any field
during four years is a pity.

Revelations are interesting; and
revelations as to our own brilliance
or ignorance are apt to be especially
interesting. Those that wish to be
revealed should read a little book
just out entitled "Quiz Yourself."
We don't know the publisher, the
author, and we are not taking or
ders—and still we think it's a good
book. It. consists of a long list of
general questions testing how many
facts we have been able to absorb
during our many days on this
earth. To those who do not wish to
deflate tho ego in public, we advise
reading the book behind locked
doors and in the thickest secrecy.
To those that think it is undesirable
to suppress—or who delight in
showing off their soul with its vices
and virtues, drag out this little
booklet and go to work.

This group of questions—or any
group consisting of material from
all the fields of knowledge—would
reveal that college students and
probably many professors too are
hopelessly one-sided. Students spe
cialize. Ford workers learn one
small operation to perfection; and
most of us are willing to do the
same with our education. That is, >
minus the perfection. One student j
specializing in "International Rela- j
tions" did not know for how long j
Senators are elected. Students in j
one sphere of history often are I
hopelessly shy on related times— j
even those periods a couple of cen- j
turies away from their "field." j
Probably, the saddest cases are*!

those who are majoring in natural
science. They fullill the few Uni
versity requirements, and then hot
foot it to their laboratories with all
the speed they can muster, there to
vegetate until a bit of sheepskin
tells them they are ready to enter
the world as educated men.

The same super-specialization goes
on among the faculty. Professors
often shock their classes into the
startling realization that all that
lectures is not educational gold—or
even •» good alloy. When, somehow
Ihe class discussion breaks away
from the exact subject, many an in
structor beats back to "His Field"
in embarrassed haste. The profes
sors who can temper their exact
knowledge with a general education
are interesting and Worthwhile.
They can put their subject over to
the student.

Professors and students are just
part of tlie environment, however,
lt'.s our age. The Jack-of-all-Trades
is doomed and education has fol
lowed suit rather than compensat
ing for what seems like an inevit
able economic situation which
forces us all into little niches—there
to keep us forever and ever. It may
be an unfortunate necessity for pre
med students to gorge themselves
almost exclusively on natural sci
ence, but for the University to al
low students who are here just for
a degree, or pre-legal, or business,
1o become specialists in any field
during four years is a pity.
