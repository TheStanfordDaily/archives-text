UNFAIR REPORTING
The Editor, Sir:
Having witnessed the game be
tween California and Stanford on
Saturday night, I was decidedly in
dignant at the write-up accorded the
contest by the "Chronicle" in which
it was branded as being, ''beyond
the control of the officials," and, "a
hectic page to the athletic history
cf the old rivals."
The play was, at times* brilliant,
and, at times, ragged, as the weak
ened Stanford five outdid itself in
a frantic effort to hold their
smoothly working opponents to a
close margin. But the game, though
contacts were frequent due to the
fast playing, was clean and the offi
cials were fair and efficient as was
evidenced by the relatively small
degree of dissatisfaction on the part
of the crowd. Probably almost
every one who witnessed the con
test saw what he thought were, or
what actually were, fouls which
went uncalled, or which were mis
called. I believe, however, that
every impartial observer will admit
that, considering the speed of the
game, the proportion of such errors
was small and that the officiating
was as well handled as should be
expected or as it is possible to ex
pect. It is well known that "per
fect" officiating is an impossibility
in a fast encounter.
Whether motivated by desire to
create a glamorous news item by
stirring up ill-feeling between the
two schools, or influenced by the
memory of the recent U.S.C.-Stan
ford contest which apparently was
played in the manner described as
referring to the contest of Saturday
night, or merely resulting from re
porting inaccuracy, 1 believe that
this write-up, which reaches a pub
lic to which the relations of the two
institutions is of general interest,
was entirely unjustified and that it
fails to convey even a fairly ac
curate impression of last Saturday
night's contest.
Sincerely,

cd upon it, and, when the visitors
departed, took motion pictures of
them and apparently tried in every
way to embarrass ladies who, prob
aby quite ignorant of the House
Rules, had visited the Hall on Sat
urday.
Their escorts, to be sure, should
have* observed the regulations of
the dormitory; but the most pas
sionate pillar of the law should find
courteous warning more proper in
such a case than a ribald insult.
I was invited to join in the dem
onstration, and I must confess that
my cold refusal scarcely concealed
my astonishment, for I had not
thought that a scouring of the en
tire campus for refuse could collect
a herd of such boorish fools.
Indeed, so deeply am I lost in the
mist of illusion that I expected to
overhear expressions of displeasure
when the affair was recounted over
the campus. It seems everywhere to
have been received gleefully, though
I heard one gentleman in the En
cina Store refer to the leader of the
gang as a "dirty dog." His expres
sion, if inelegant, is not wholly un
just.
Psychologists might find it inter
esting to determine the degree of
sexual repression and perversion
necessary to cause such mob action;
but even an unscientific mind, I
hope, can find it not too difficult to
estimate without considerable error
the mental age of participants.
I may add, with pride, that I know
personally none of the persons con
cerned in any way with the matter.
Respectfully,
Edwin E. Williams
