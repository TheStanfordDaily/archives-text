# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
well the world seems to be set
tling down to a normal pace once
more with a few people getting in
terested in swimming and diving
for pearls and oysters in lagunita !
and a few more remembering that
collitch was once spoken of as a
place to study in
with a catch in the voice
windjammer remarks how nice
it is to have the little gals
about campus being nice to you
again for your own sweet sake
and not because you have a pull .
with a nugget or a, favorite
sorority as the case may be
which reminds us of the old riddle !
when is a nugget not a nugget and j
the answer whetY she is pledged '
along with sixteen other nuggets |
which likewise reminds us of
an interesting bit of informa- j
tion we've wanted to give you j
for a long time namely that |
guerilla warfare that much
written-of subject has at last i

come to be properly known as
the wedding ceremony of the
apes take that and like it
our dear old friend the san fran
cisco chronicle has once more come
to the rescue by giving us some
thing to talk about maybe you didnt
notice but last friday they an
nounced along with the other Stan
ford pledges the names of Ihe chil
dren who pledged alpha THI
by the same token we should
have kappa kappa knee, delta
delta hand, gamma femur, and
angle omicron pi
we shouldnt pass up the chance
to say it was a pretty fair ball game
the other night not exactly fair we
mean but something to look at any
way
and to fill up space because
it takes time to recover from
last weeks biblical mood we
rise to state that celibacy is a
disease of the brain according
to the office wit and wish you
a pleasant morning
