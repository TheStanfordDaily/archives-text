### 
THE HONOR OF THE FAMILY— J
At the Varsity Theatre.
This sc:-called modernized version i
of Balsnc's work is enough to make |
the old boy turn over in his grave. j
The plot is good though over dra- I
matic but the acting is atrocious, j
However there are some splendid!
uniforms, two or three good mous- j
taches, a very realistic saber duel, j
and some grand lingerie draped >
very convincingly around the not- ,
so-bad figure of Bebe Daniels.
For football enthusiasts and U.S.C. \
baiters there is a complete play-by- j
play picture of the Tulane-Southern
California game. For the baiters we j
recommend the play which shows a !
S.C. man kicking Glover in the I
head. —J.F.A.
DANCE TEAM—At the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Like the Little Girl with Curls, |
when this cinema of two ballroom j
dancers whom success almost parts,;

is good, it's very good, indeed. But
when it turns sentimental, it's bore
some. Mostly, however, it is good.
Roughs, or gentlemen with no
taste for sloppy slush, will render
the weil-known bird on several oc
casions in their own inimitable
fashion, this reviewer prophesies—
notably when Mr. Mulligan (James
Dunn) takes time out and a couple
of hundred feet of film to pray for
the mutual success of himself and
his dancing partner, Miss Kirk
(Sally Filers), on the eve of their
debut to the chop suey trade. But
oh, how, on many, many more oc
casions, they will take to Mulligan
and Kirk as they struggle from the
obscurity as a dancing team to their
names in lights at the fashionable
Lido!"
Sleep, if you must, Rough, when
James Dunn and Sally Filers are
out of the picture, but when either
one steps back into view just get
ready to enjoy yourself. You will.
