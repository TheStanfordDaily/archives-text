FOR THOSE who like their bas
ketball in the rough and ready
style, Saturday night's game with
California should have been satis
lying fare indeed. Bodily contact
was the rule, Referee Herb Dana
( vidently having forgotten that
football season is over.
BUT there was an enormous
difference between that game
and the two with Southern Cali
fornia the week before. Nibs
Price's team was not dirty.
There was a total lack of the
tactics shown by the Trojans in
the roughhouse affairs of the
week previous.
And in fairness to Dana and Um
pire Leith, it must be recorded that
while they allowed the fracas to be
come i bit crude in spots, there was
none of the partiality which charac
terized the work of one official dur
ing the Southern California series.

MEANWHILE, "Silent Sam" Bar
ry, in spite of his best stalling tac
t us, dropped his first conference
came to U.C.L.A. Saturday night.
The Trojans, according to Asso
ciated Press dispatches, quickly
jumped into a 5 to 2 lead and then
lell bade on their famous (or in
famous) stalling game. They kept
possession of the ball for the rest
of the half, not another basket being
shot.
The crowd clamored for ac
tion. They screamed for it. Then
began such a shower of pro
grains, pennies, peanuts, and
what have you, that the game
had to be hailed while the floor
was cleared.
THAT from Los Angeles fans,
supposedly rabid Trojan boosters.
THAT from a team that has un
doubted strength, unquestioned
speed.
The second half saw the Bruins
rally to nose out their unpopular
rivals by a 19 to 17 score in the
closing seconds.
THE BEST argument against tac-
Mi'.-s which are so obviously unpopu
lar with the fans was advanced by
Curely Grieve, sports editor of the
San Francisco Examiner, some time
ago.
Grieve pointed out that the
popularity of basketball is based
on its speed, that it is speed
which attracts capacity houses
to gaires, and that big audiences
pay coaches' salaries.
That Barry may be slowly strang
ling the goose which lays the golden
egg was demonstrated by that crowd
Saturday night.

CALIFORNIA IS just a game be
hind Southern California and may
be off to the races. While they were
slow in finding their stride, those
Bears are now on their way.
Conference standings:
Won Lost Pet.
Southern California.4 1 .800
California 3 2 .600
Stanford 2 3 .400

CALIFORNIA IS just a game be
hind Southern California and may
be off to the races. While they were
slow in finding their stride, those
Bears are now on their way.
Conference standings:
Won Lost Pet.
Southern California.4 1 .800
California 3 2 .600
Stanford 2 3 .400
U.C.L.A 1 4 .200
Next week-end Stanford moves
south for the final pair of games
with U.C.L.A., while U.S.C. will
meet California in two contests at
the Oakland Auditorium. —L.M.C.
FOR THOSE who like their bas
ketball in the rough and ready
style, Saturday night's game with
California should have been satis
lying fare indeed. Bodily contact
was the rule, Referee Herb Dana
( vidently having forgotten that
football season is over.
BUT there was an enormous
difference between that game
and the two with Southern Cali
fornia the week before. Nibs
Price's team was not dirty.
There was a total lack of the
tactics shown by the Trojans in
the roughhouse affairs of the
week previous.
And in fairness to Dana and Um
pire Leith, it must be recorded that
while they allowed the fracas to be
come i bit crude in spots, there was
none of the partiality which charac
terized the work of one official dur
ing the Southern California series.

MEANWHILE, "Silent Sam" Bar
ry, in spite of his best stalling tac
t us, dropped his first conference
came to U.C.L.A. Saturday night.
The Trojans, according to Asso
ciated Press dispatches, quickly
jumped into a 5 to 2 lead and then
lell bade on their famous (or in
famous) stalling game. They kept
possession of the ball for the rest
of the half, not another basket being
shot.
The crowd clamored for ac
tion. They screamed for it. Then
began such a shower of pro
grains, pennies, peanuts, and
what have you, that the game
had to be hailed while the floor
was cleared.
THAT from Los Angeles fans,
supposedly rabid Trojan boosters.
THAT from a team that has un
doubted strength, unquestioned
speed.
The second half saw the Bruins
rally to nose out their unpopular
rivals by a 19 to 17 score in the
closing seconds.
THE BEST argument against tac-
Mi'.-s which are so obviously unpopu
lar with the fans was advanced by
Curely Grieve, sports editor of the
San Francisco Examiner, some time
ago.
Grieve pointed out that the
popularity of basketball is based
on its speed, that it is speed
which attracts capacity houses
to gaires, and that big audiences
pay coaches' salaries.
That Barry may be slowly strang
ling the goose which lays the golden
egg was demonstrated by that crowd
Saturday night.
