# CINDER ARTISTS ARE GIVEN LAY-OFF FROM WEEKLY TRACKFEST
## 
### 
Perhaps to rest the weary track j
managers from the arduous task of j
r etting up hurdles and lugging j
; round t-hojs and disci, but more j
probably to give his varsity men a I
i hanee to get in better condition, I
Coach Bill Ellington called off last i
Friday's practice meet. The weekly |
tests of brawn and speed will be |
u-sumi'd this Friday, by which time j
most of the partially injured run- j
nets should be in better shape. j
Among the Indians who are not !
yet ready for competition is Paul j
Aebersold, ace of the two-milers. ,
Aebersold underwent an operation i
recently .designed to clear out some ,
obstructed nasal passages, and he
has not yet recovered his full
strength due to his layoff of several
weeks. Another eight-lap expert, ]
Olie Amdahl, has been taking it i
(;;sy due to a lame leg, but expects
to he t ble to start intensive work
outs soon.
Because there was no meet sched- j
ul( 'I for Friday, Ellington "allowed"
omc of the hale and hearty track- i
tors to run time trials in the 352'
last Thursday. In the varsity race
Frank Lombardi, Jimmie Willson,
and Cotto Herbert ran tho distance j
<.r ily in 40 seconds fiat. The frosh '
heat was won by Pierre Zucco, with
Ward Vincent second.
