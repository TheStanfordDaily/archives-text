# Champion Nine Knocks Over Olympic Club, 4-2
## GOLDMAN'S WORK OUTSTANDING FOR CARD BALL OUTFIT Rintala Brings In Two To Start Scoring; Estes, Caddel Pitch 
### Bob Wade 
Led by little "Lefty" Goldman,
sophomore left fielder, Stanford's
varsity baseball team got off to an
auspicious start when it took the
opening pre-season game from the
Olympic Club, 4-2.
All Goldman did was collect three
hits out of four times at bat, score
two of his team's four runs, and
make two nice catches out in left
held. His hitting stamps him as a
real contender for the berth left
open when Captain Johnny Hunlcen
graduated from the championship
outfit last June.
Estes, Caddel Pitch
With Bob Estes hurling only fair
ball, the Club gathered eight of its
nine hits and both runs in the five
innings that he worked. At that, the
transfer from San Mateo had only
one bad frame, the fourth, when the
clubmen bunched three of their
hits to score their two runs. Ernie
Caddel toiled the remaining part of
the game, and limited the Post
Street aggregation to one hit. The
big right-hander looked lots better
than he did last year.
Taking the lead in the opening
inning, the Indians rang up two
markers when Rintala's single
brought in both Goldman and Del
mas, after "Lefty" had singled and
Delmas was safe on Collins' bad
throw.
The Tribe rang up another in the
second, after Livermore had singled,
when Goldman bagged number two.
And the last tally was shoved
across in the fifth canto on hits by
Goldman, Delmas, and Rintala's
out on a fielder's choice.
Final Chance
Stanford had one other big chance
to score, in the seventh, but with
two down and the bags bulging
Philippi hit an easy grounder to
short, and Campbell was out trying
to reach second, Connor to Collins.
The Olympic Club garnered its
brace of markers on singles by Gari
baldi, Randall, and Winchester.
Garibaldi was the visitors' big gun,
getting three for four.

Led by little "Lefty" Goldman,
sophomore left fielder, Stanford's
varsity baseball team got off to an
auspicious start when it took the
opening pre-season game from the
Olympic Club, 4-2.
All Goldman did was collect three
hits out of four times at bat, score
two of his team's four runs, and
make two nice catches out in left
held. His hitting stamps him as a
real contender for the berth left
open when Captain Johnny Hunlcen
graduated from the championship
outfit last June.
Estes, Caddel Pitch
With Bob Estes hurling only fair
ball, the Club gathered eight of its
nine hits and both runs in the five
innings that he worked. At that, the
transfer from San Mateo had only
one bad frame, the fourth, when the
clubmen bunched three of their
hits to score their two runs. Ernie
Caddel toiled the remaining part of
the game, and limited the Post
Street aggregation to one hit. The
big right-hander looked lots better
than he did last year.
Taking the lead in the opening
inning, the Indians rang up two
markers when Rintala's single
brought in both Goldman and Del
mas, after "Lefty" had singled and
Delmas was safe on Collins' bad
throw.
The Tribe rang up another in the
second, after Livermore had singled,
when Goldman bagged number two.
And the last tally was shoved
across in the fifth canto on hits by
Goldman, Delmas, and Rintala's
out on a fielder's choice.
Final Chance
Stanford had one other big chance
to score, in the seventh, but with
two down and the bags bulging
