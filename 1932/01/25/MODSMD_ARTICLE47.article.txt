Winning the team championship
from the Olympic Club and plac
! ing three men in the first lour in
| the individual bouts, Stanford's
fencers auspiciously opened their
season last Friday night in the first
of the A.F.L.A. tournaments. Fri
! day's matches were restricted to the
I open saber championships, and Cap
, tain Leonard Pockman, Jim Reed,
and Tom Pockman finished first,
I third, and fourth, respectively among
j all the contestants as well as cap
■ turing the team title.
! The University of California de
! cided at the last moment not to
j send a team, and Stanford's only
! opposition was furnished by the
Olympic Club. The Indians won,
I seven matches to two, with Leonard
I Pockman winning all three of his
j bouts and Reed and Tom Pockman
j each winning two out of three.
Captain Poekman's closest opposi
; tion was furnished by Leicester, the
j elderly secretary of the Bay Divi-
I sion of the A.F.L.A., who was fenc

(ing for the Olympic Club. Pockman
| finally defeated Leicester five hits
1 to four in the best bout of the eve-
I ning. Leicester, who won both of
j the Club's matches in the team
| bouts, finished second in the indi
j vidual championship.
A single set of bouts was held,
j the points scored counting toward
! both the individual and team titles,
j Waffa and Edenholm competed un-
I attached, while Erbe and Musetti,
with Leicester, comprised the Olym
pic Club team.
The first three men—Leonard
j Pockman of Stanford, Leicester, and
j Jim Reed of Stanford—will consti
i tute the saber team that will repre
| sent Northern California in the Pa-
I cific Coast finals that are to be held
;in Los Angeles some time next
1 April. If Pockman can continue to
display the form he showed last
week, hit; chances to win the finals
and ultimately to earn a place on
the United States Olympic team are
i exceedingly bright.
