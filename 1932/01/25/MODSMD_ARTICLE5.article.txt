# MOVE TO AVERT SHANGHAI RIOTS
## Chinese Tradesmen Band In Jap Disorders 
### 
SHANGHAI, Jan. 24 (/P). â€” Chi- j
ncse business men intervened to- ;
night in an effort to avert financial j
loss from Japanese occupation of f
Shanghai as a consequence of anti- i
Japanese disorders.
They urged the National govern- ,
ment at Nanking to instruct Wu j
Teh-chen, Chinese mayor of Shang- j
hai, to agree unconditionally to the |
Japanese demands. These demands |
call for disbanding of anti-Japanese '
societies and the payment of dam- J
ages for a recent attack on a number I
of Buddhist monks.
There was a growing feeling the j
Chinese would give way before the |
demands, which were reinforced by |
the presence of Japanese warships j
here and a threat to occupy the city.
The second of the Japanese Bud- I
dhist monks who were beaten Janu- I
ary 18 died today, causing renewed j
resentment among Japanese.
The Chinese business men in
formed the National government
that, the country's economic struc
tui"e was in no condition to with
stand a foreign military occupation
of the nation's commercial and fi- j
nancial metropolis.
