# BEAR CUBS DOWN BABE HOOP TEAM BY 47-33 MARGIN
## Reserves Take Two From Fresno High Team By 23-16 And 25-20 
### Albert Guerard 
The California freshmen were too [
hot and too tall for the Stanford ,
yearlings Saturday night, and won i
the first game of the annual Little I
Big Series, 47-33. Freshman re- j
serve players played two games with i
Fresno High over the week-end, j
winning 23-1G on Friday, while j
Saturday afternoon the Indians
again came out on top by , a 25-20
score.
The Papooses played their best i
game of the year on Saturday night. ;
The much-underrated Bear Cubs |
worked smoothly most of the time, j
I they controlled nearly every tip-off,
' and they had three dead-eye shots j
iin Jack Morgans, forward, Dave ;
! Meeks, center, and Dave Bauer, ;
| guard. Brilliant play by Lory Roth- !
j ert, who was high-point man for
Stanford with 12 points, and Guards j
I Gordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte j
kept the Indians within striking dis- -
! tance until midway through the |
| final period when Meeks, Morgans, \
, and Bauer began dropping in shots !
| from inside the foul line.
Babes Take Lead
The Indians started fast, and has- |
kets by Mallatratt and Kelly gave j
; them a 5-1 lead. Five minutes later i
; Morgans sank a close-in shot, and j
I the Bear Cubs took an 8-6 lead. The ]
! Stanford five put up a tremendous |
J battle in that first half, but they i
I were never able to overtake the i
! Bears. A long shot by Mallatratt
■ tnded first half scoring, with the j
Bears enjoying a 22-15 lead,
i Fawcett's five came back for the j
second half in a winning frame of ;
mind, but -Darracq, Meeks, and Luce '
i tanked long shots from behind the j
I foul line in fast succession. The,
j .sudden streak sent the score to
I 29-IG. It broke the spirit of the J
| yearling team, and when Morgans !
j sank another long one a minute ;
i later, they knew that they were
j beaten. ;
Indians Rally
Butte sank a free shot, and Mal-
I latratt netted another of his long
| prayer shots with ten minutes to go.
llt brough the Indians within nine j
! points of their opponents, but that
J was their last stand.
Midway through the last period ;
Wally Crowe went in for Tom,Kelly
i at center, and with Butte coming up j
to jump on tip-offs, this combina- j
i tion gave the smoothest showing ot 1
1 the evening. Charles Coiner and i
' Rothert played the forwards at this I
I stage of the contest.
The Indian freshmen were not
; outclassed. The tall Calit'ornians
, were good shots, but they looked
very ragged and clumsy at times.
Fawcett's team was a trifle more
finished, but the Californians showed
vast improvement over their earlier
| games, and should become a very
i strong quintet. Eighty points in one
game can oniy be made by fast,
! reckless basketball. From the spec
tator's point of view, the game was
i much better than the Big Game
• varsity tussle.
Weaver Stars
i Griswold and Henry Coiner looked
] very good in Friday's reserve con
j test. The first-string quintet was
; thrown against the Fresnans late in
! the game, and they helped to put
: the battle on ice. Winstead Weaver
; was high-point man of Saturday
| afternoon's game with eight points.
i Half-time score favored the year
' lings 15-11.
Next week-end brings another
hard brace of games for Coach
! Fawcett's still developing five.

The California freshmen were too [
hot and too tall for the Stanford ,
yearlings Saturday night, and won i
the first game of the annual Little I
Big Series, 47-33. Freshman re- j
serve players played two games with i
Fresno High over the week-end, j
winning 23-1G on Friday, while j
Saturday afternoon the Indians
again came out on top by , a 25-20
score.
The Papooses played their best i
game of the year on Saturday night. ;
The much-underrated Bear Cubs |
worked smoothly most of the time, j
I they controlled nearly every tip-off,
' and they had three dead-eye shots j
iin Jack Morgans, forward, Dave ;
! Meeks, center, and Dave Bauer, ;
| guard. Brilliant play by Lory Roth- !
j ert, who was high-point man for
Stanford with 12 points, and Guards j
I Gordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte j
kept the Indians within striking dis- -
! tance until midway through the |
| final period when Meeks, Morgans, \
, and Bauer began dropping in shots !
| from inside the foul line.
Babes Take Lead
The Indians started fast, and has- |
kets by Mallatratt and Kelly gave j
; them a 5-1 lead. Five minutes later i
; Morgans sank a close-in shot, and j
I the Bear Cubs took an 8-6 lead. The ]
! Stanford five put up a tremendous |
J battle in that first half, but they i
I were never able to overtake the i
! Bears. A long shot by Mallatratt
■ tnded first half scoring, with the j
Bears enjoying a 22-15 lead,
i Fawcett's five came back for the j
second half in a winning frame of ;
mind, but -Darracq, Meeks, and Luce '
i tanked long shots from behind the j
I foul line in fast succession. The,
j .sudden streak sent the score to
I 29-IG. It broke the spirit of the J
| yearling team, and when Morgans !
j sank another long one a minute ;
i later, they knew that they were
j beaten. ;
Indians Rally
Butte sank a free shot, and Mal-
I latratt netted another of his long
| prayer shots with ten minutes to go.
llt brough the Indians within nine j
! points of their opponents, but that
J was their last stand.
Midway through the last period ;
Wally Crowe went in for Tom,Kelly
i at center, and with Butte coming up j
to jump on tip-offs, this combina- j
i tion gave the smoothest showing ot 1
1 the evening. Charles Coiner and i
' Rothert played the forwards at this I
I stage of the contest.
The Indian freshmen were not
; outclassed. The tall Calit'ornians
, were good shots, but they looked
very ragged and clumsy at times.
Fawcett's team was a trifle more
finished, but the Californians showed
vast improvement over their earlier
| games, and should become a very
i strong quintet. Eighty points in one
game can oniy be made by fast,
! reckless basketball. From the spec
