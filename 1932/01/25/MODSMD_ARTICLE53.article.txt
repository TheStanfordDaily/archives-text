# PHI DELTS, SIGMA CHIS WILL TIP-OFF IN GASABA GAME
## Dope Points To Tonight's Tilt Deciding League Leadership TONIGHT'S SCHEDULE 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Sigma Chi vs. Phi Hells, 7 p.m.,
Pavilion
Japanese Club vs. El Campo,
8 p.m., Pavilion
Chi Psi vs. Phi Kappa Psi, 7
p.m., Gymnasium
Sequoia I vs. Alpha Dells. 8
p.m., Gymnasium

Meeting tonight at 7 o'clock in!
the outfits from Sigma Chi
and Phi Delta Theta houses will find
their hardest contest in their League
I schedule and both believe that
the League leadership will rest with
the victorious quintet. In all proba- i
bility this will be the case, provid- !
ing, of course, that the Phi Kappa I
Psi hoopsters do not show too much
improvement over last week's show
ing. With this five in good form, the
result would quite likely be very
different.
The Phi Delts will center then
scoring drive around Marcus God
frey, the main threat in last week's '
machinery, while their opponents |
will probably feature Bud Daven
port, Paul Palmer, and Henry Haight
in a desperate attempt to remain in
the running to keep last year's
hard - won championship. Both
squads should show considerable
improvement in form over last
week's contests.

Meeting tonight at 7 o'clock in!
the outfits from Sigma Chi
and Phi Delta Theta houses will find
their hardest contest in their League
I schedule and both believe that
the League leadership will rest with
the victorious quintet. In all proba- i
bility this will be the case, provid- !
ing, of course, that the Phi Kappa I
Psi hoopsters do not show too much
improvement over last week's show
ing. With this five in good form, the
result would quite likely be very
different.
The Phi Delts will center then
scoring drive around Marcus God
frey, the main threat in last week's '
machinery, while their opponents |
will probably feature Bud Daven
port, Paul Palmer, and Henry Haight
in a desperate attempt to remain in
the running to keep last year's
hard - won championship. Both
squads should show considerable
improvement in form over last
week's contests.
