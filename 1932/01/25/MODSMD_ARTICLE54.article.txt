# SENIORS DEFEAT SOPHOMORES TO WIN INTERCLASS WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
Playing for good old charity, the
senior water poloists came through
with a last-minute spurt to increase
their lead over the sophomores from
i 5-3 1o a final 10-3 victory Saturday.
This gives the fourth-year men the
i interclass championship of the Uni
, versity. A smooth freshman outfit
made good its claim to third place
by taking the juniors, 6-5, in a
; game so closely contested that two
overtime periods were necessary.
Clapp starred for the seniors,
I scoring no less than seven of the
i ten counts. Avery accounting for
i two, and Woods for the remaining
! one. Fouls galore stirred the crowd
j to laughter more than once, and re
! suited in a goal for the sophomores
; when Wiget was given a free throw
in the first half. He tallied two of
I the sophomore scores, Murrieta
' shooting" the other.
McKelvey, at sprint for the cham
i pions, got the tip-off most of the
time, and Booth was outstanding,
along with Clapp, at forward. Avery
j at center back, Woods and Harris
! at guard, and Linton at the goal,
, completed the winning seven. Juda

was the only substitute for the sen
iors, replacing McKelvey for a short
time, and Von Saltza and Schmidt
had short opportunities for the sec
ond-year men. Wiget at sprint,
Graves and McDowell at forward,
McGavern and Clark as guards,
Murrieia at center back, and Kal
enborn at goal made up the losing
J team.
The preliminary game ended 4 to
i 4, and was still tied 5-5 at the end
| of the first extra period. It took the
! second period to bring the Babes
I up to 6-5, Triolo, as sprint, scoring
I four of the winning digits. Boothe
made the other two, Benet, Taranik,
Hirsch, Fry and Cook supporting.
, Edwards, Warren, Tebbets, Irvine,
; Pease, Simons, Kinkead, Thrond
son, and Knapp played for the jun-
I iors, some as substitutes. Edwards
I was responsible for three of the
I goals, and Warren and Tebbets for
i one each. Capers substituted fur the
i yearlings.
Bill Campbell and Bob Wardwell
j did their part supplying diving en
i tertainment of a very competent
' sort between games.
