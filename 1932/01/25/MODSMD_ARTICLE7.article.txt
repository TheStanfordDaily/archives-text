# POSTMASTER WARNS AGAINST WRITING IN PARCEL POST MAIL
## 
### 
- Students are warned by A. H.
Wheeler, superintendent of the post
office, not to enclose any written
t matter in parcel post packages. The
penalty is payment of first class
i rates on the package, and in several
! cases where written matter was dis
covered in laundry bags, the owners
had to pay about $4 before they
| could get the bags.
Wheeler also asks that mail be
properly addressed and be provided
with a return address. He exhibited
two letters stamped and sealed, but
bearing no writing on the envelope.
Such letters go to the Dead Letter
Office, and may never be delivered.
In any case, letters nol properly ad
dressed must be delayed for diree-
I tory service.
