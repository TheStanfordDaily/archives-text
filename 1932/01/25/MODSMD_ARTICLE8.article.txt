# ERIC DRUMMOND TO QUIT LEAGUE
## Discouragement Of Office Given As Reason 
### 
GENEVA, Jan. 24 </P). â€” The
League of Nations, ready to grapple
again with the Manchurian conflict
and facing the coming World Dis
armament Conference, was threat
ened tonight with the loss of its first
and only Secretary-general, Sir Eric
Drummond.
Sir Eric, wearied and discouraged
by the growing burdens of his
unique office, was said in authorita
tive circles to be planning to submit
his resignation to the Council to
morrow when it convenes in its
(56th session.
The belief was expressed by some
officials that the League's executive
board would persuade the Secre
tary-general to retain his post at
least until the double crisis repre
sented in the Sino-Japanesc conflict
and the arms parley had been solved.
But Sir Eric was said to feel his
retirement should be effective at
once inasmuch as the Disarmament
Conference is expected to drag on
indefinitely and the Manchurian
problem likely will be a burning
issue for many months. Retiring
Foreign Minister Briand of France
was discussed in informed quarters
as a possible successor.
