# NEVERS AVERS HE IS THROUGH WITH PRO GRID
## Former Stanford Fullback To Quit Playing While "Still In One Piece" MAKES 4 TOUCHDOWNS Pop Warner Calls Star The Greatest Of All 
### Lowell Cox 
Ernie Nevers has played his last
game of football.
"The greatest of them all "yester
day announced his intention of re
tiring from the professional game
while he is "still in one piece."
Sunday saw the former Stanford
fullback wind up his playing career
in a blaze of glory, when his all
stars defeated a team captained by
the brilliant Frank Carideo, 26 to
14, in a charity contest played at
Kezar stadium. After playing a bril
liant game in which he scored all of
his team's points, Nevers broke his
arm on the last play of the contest.
Winds Up Career
Pop Warner, commenting on Sun
day's game, last night declared: "If
that game was Nevers' last, it cer
tainly was a great way to wind up
his career. He played a truly won
derful game.
"Since there is a limit to the time
a person can play professional foot
ball, I believe that this is a good
time for him to retire. There is a
fine opportunity for him as a coach,
and while he may not find it so
profitable for the first year or two,
in the long run there is more future
in the coaching game."
"Greatest Player"
The Old Fox, who has named
Ernie as the greatest player he ever
coached, even picking him over Jim
Thorpe, said that the blond star in
his final game surpassed the heights
he reached as a college player. "He
was more finished, more polished,"
declared Warner. "He had more
confidence and polish."
Nevers was captain of the Stan
lord eleven in 1925. At the close of
the season professional football
claimcd him, and he had played the
game ever since. During the last
season he was both star and coach
of the Chicago Cardinals.
ouuks Coach Job
A pitcher for the Stanford base
ball nine while in the University, he
supplemented his gridiron earnings
one season hurling for the St. Louis
Browns of the National League.
Later he played with the San Fran
cisco Missions of the Pacific Coast
League.
Football is his real game, how
ever, and Nevers intends, to con
tinue in it as a coach. He applied
for the S.F.U. coaching job last
week, but his application was re
ceived too late, officials of the in
stitution having already decided on
another former Stanford man,
"Spud" Lewis.
Ernie is now seeking the post at
Nevada, which is believed to be
open. Doubtless he would leap at
the opportunity to return to Stan
ford as an assistant coach, were a
position open.

Sunday saw the former Stanford
fullback wind up his playing career
in a blaze of glory, when his all
stars defeated a team captained by
the brilliant Frank Carideo, 26 to
14, in a charity contest played at
Kezar stadium. After playing a bril
liant game in which he scored all of
his team's points, Nevers broke his
arm on the last play of the contest.
Winds Up Career
Pop Warner, commenting on Sun
day's game, last night declared: "If
that game was Nevers' last, it cer
tainly was a great way to wind up
his career. He played a truly won
derful game.
"Since there is a limit to the time
a person can play professional foot
ball, I believe that this is a good
time for him to retire. There is a
fine opportunity for him as a coach,
and while he may not find it so
profitable for the first year or two,
in the long run there is more future
in the coaching game."
"Greatest Player"
The Old Fox, who has named
Ernie as the greatest player he ever
coached, even picking him over Jim
Thorpe, said that the blond star in
his final game surpassed the heights
he reached as a college player. "He
was more finished, more polished,"
declared Warner. "He had more
confidence and polish."
Nevers was captain of the Stan
lord eleven in 1925. At the close of
the season professional football
claimcd him, and he had played the
game ever since. During the last
season he was both star and coach
of the Chicago Cardinals.
ouuks Coach Job
A pitcher for the Stanford base
ball nine while in the University, he
supplemented his gridiron earnings
one season hurling for the St. Louis
Browns of the National League.
Later he played with the San Fran
cisco Missions of the Pacific Coast
League.
Football is his real game, how
ever, and Nevers intends, to con
tinue in it as a coach. He applied
for the S.F.U. coaching job last
week, but his application was re
ceived too late, officials of the in
stitution having already decided on
another former Stanford man,
"Spud" Lewis.
Ernie is now seeking the post at
Nevada, which is believed to be
open. Doubtless he would leap at
the opportunity to return to Stan
ford as an assistant coach, were a
position open.
Ernie Nevers has played his last
game of football.
"The greatest of them all "yester
