# ASTRONOMER TO SPEAK TONIGHT
## Size Of Universe Is Title Of de Sitter Lecture 
### 
One of the leading astronomers in j
the woild and a colleague of Ein- j
stein's, Dr. Willem de Sitter, will ;
speak in the Assembly Hall at 7:MO j
o'clock tonight on "The Size of the |
Universe."

Leading scientists say that Dr. de

Dr. de Sitter is Professor of Astron
omy and Director of the Astronomi
cal Observatory at the University
of Leyden, Holland. He came to the
United States last September at the
invitation of President Sproul of
the University of California and has
delivered lectures at a number of
institutions in the past months.

Dr. de Sitter has made brilliant
J contributions in many fields of
I astronomy, but is best known for
I his critical work on the theory of
j relativity, and in the field of classi
cal mechanics.

i Born May 6, 1872, at Sneek in
Friesland of the Netherlands, he was
a student at the Groningen Astro
nomical Laboratory, 1891 to 1897.

i Born May 6, 1872, at Sneek in
Friesland of the Netherlands, he was
a student at the Groningen Astro
nomical Laboratory, 1891 to 1897.
From August 1897 to December 1899
he was engaged in observation work
; at the Cape Observatory, under Gill.
In 1902 he earned the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy at Broningen
by a discussion of heliometer ob
servations of Jupiter's satellites
made by Gill and Finlay. With this
he started a never-ceasing flow of
j important contributions to the
; mathematical theory of the Jupiter
J system. Since 1908 he has been Pro
j fessor of Theoretical Astronomy al
| the University of Leyden and since
j 1919, Director of the Observatory.
Dr. de Sitter has received many
j honors in recent years. He suc
! ceeded President Emeritus Camp-
I bell of the University of California
| as president of the International
i Astronomical Union and is- a mem
j ber of several National Academies.
| Among other honors which he has
j received are the Watson Gold Medai
of the National Academy of Sciences
of the United States, the Gold Med
!al of the Royal Astronomical So
! ciety, and the Bruce Gold Medal of
i the Astronomical Society of the
| Pacific, before which he will de
! liver a public lecture in San Fran
j cisco during his visit to the Bay
I Region.
One of the leading astronomers in j
the woild and a colleague of Ein- j
stein's, Dr. Willem de Sitter, will ;
speak in the Assembly Hall at 7:MO j
o'clock tonight on "The Size of the |
Universe."

Leading scientists say that Dr. de
Sitter's theory is the only clue we
possess as to dimensions of space.
Dr. de Sitter is Professor of Astron
omy and Director of the Astronomi
cal Observatory at the University
of Leyden, Holland. He came to the
United States last September at the
invitation of President Sproul of
the University of California and has
delivered lectures at a number of
institutions in the past months.

Dr. de Sitter has made brilliant
J contributions in many fields of
I astronomy, but is best known for
I his critical work on the theory of
j relativity, and in the field of classi
cal mechanics.
