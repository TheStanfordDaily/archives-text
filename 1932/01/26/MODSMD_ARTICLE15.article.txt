# Snake Expert Lectures Before Jordan Seminar
## 
### 
Driven from the bookkeeping pro-
I fession by the depression, Theodore
TauSch of Los Angeles, who lcc
lured before the Jordan seminar in
Jordan Hall yesterday, returned to
| his boyhood hobby—snakes.
Tausch travels all over the West
■ ern states giving lectures in high
i schools and colleges on the deadly
jpoisoneis. He carries his 25 rattle
' snakes in four bags; three separate
I and the rest together in one bag.
Although none of his pets has had
had its fangs pulled out, he has
! only been bitten twice. He blames
: that on his own carelessness. As a
part of his talk, he explained what
to do if bitten by a rattler.
Claiming handling the snakes with
j safety is a matter of having confi
dence in himself, Tausch says he i*
lone of tluee men in the world who

| pick up deadly reptiles with their
; bare hands. The snakes are grasped
| in the middle and can be handled
! freely with perfect assurance —il 11
i you know how.
One of the prizes of his collection
j is a ring-tail diamond-back rattler, j
I However, for demonstrating the
' fangs, he used just an ordinary |
j snake, holding its mouth open with j
| his bare fingers. One of the stu
dents attending the lecture was al- |
| lowed to hold a snake in his hands, J
j but Tausch soon took it away before |
[ any casualties occurred.
Tausch is an Austrian by birth
and has studied snakes intensively
j since he was twelve years old. He
I chose to be a bookkeeper to earn
his living but soon discovered that i
people were more interested in
j rattlers, so now he devotes all his
I time to the business.
