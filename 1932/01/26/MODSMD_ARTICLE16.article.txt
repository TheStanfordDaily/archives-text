# BUNN POLISHES CARD OFFENSE FOR UCLA TILT
## Bill Doub Returns To Squad But Edelen Added To Hospital List 
### Bob Wade 
Still confident that his boys can
j win the conference basketball crown
i if they play up to their abilities,
Coach John Bunn sent the squad
| through a protracted scrimmage last
| night in preparation for the two
i games with U.C.L.A. next week-end
| in Xios Angeles.
With the return of Bill Doub,
| fully recovered from the groin in
| jury which put him out of both the
i Trojan and Bear contests, Bunn
| shifted Hancock to guard and alter
nated Doub with Packard at center
j on the first string.
Edclcn in Hospital
Bunn's worries, however, are far
from over yet. As Doub returned,
Edelen left for the hospital with an
injured foot that may turn out to
be infccted. If it does, the flashy
j guard will be lost to the team for
l at least the coming week-end. But
j with Tod, Hancock, Baker, and Nor
j gard in good health the guard situ
ation is still promising.
Referring to last Saturday's dc
' feat at the hands of the polished
! California quintet Bunn said:
"There are no alibis offered and
j none wanted. We didn't play the
I basketball that would win, nor the
i game of which we are capable. The
| team played a great defensive game,
' but they took approximately half
I the shots at goal that I expect in a
full-length contest. We have the
; offense, but until we use it we will
never know whether it is worth the
| time we have spent on it. So far
i the boys have so concentrated on
their defense that they have forgot
! ten to go out and score enough
: points to win games."
Hancock Shifted to Guard
i There was little of the usual free
j throw practice, and competition
| against the Grays, last night, that
I have characterized previous work
i outs. Bunn started his first string—
i LaCombe, Cosgrove, Packard, Nor
, gard, and Baker—against the second
j string—Glasgow, Palmer, Doub,
j Hancock, and Tod. At the end of
ten minutes he interchanged Doub
j and Hancock with Packard and
I Baker. This combination looked like
I the most promising quintet Bunn
has yet put on the floor.
i The guard posts will probably be
! doubtful until Stanford starts the
| game Friday night. Norgard is good
i enough to start on any team that
has shown here so far, but shifting
i Hancock back has increased Baker's
j competition for the other berth, and
i if Tod continues to improve as much
I as he has the past week, he will
| make it hot for both of them.

i enough to start on any team that

Still confident that his boys can

i if they play up to their abilities,
Coach John Bunn sent the squad

| night in preparation for the two
i games with U.C.L.A. next week-end
| in Xios Angeles.
With the return of Bill Doub,
| fully recovered from the groin in
| jury which put him out of both the
i Trojan and Bear contests, Bunn
| shifted Hancock to guard and alter
nated Doub with Packard at center
j on the first string.
Edclcn in Hospital
Bunn's worries, however, are far
from over yet. As Doub returned,
Edelen left for the hospital with an
injured foot that may turn out to
be infccted. If it does, the flashy
j guard will be lost to the team for
l at least the coming week-end. But
j with Tod, Hancock, Baker, and Nor
j gard in good health the guard situ
ation is still promising.
Referring to last Saturday's dc
' feat at the hands of the polished
! California quintet Bunn said:
"There are no alibis offered and
j none wanted. We didn't play the
I basketball that would win, nor the
i game of which we are capable. The
| team played a great defensive game,
' but they took approximately half
I the shots at goal that I expect in a
full-length contest. We have the
; offense, but until we use it we will
never know whether it is worth the
| time we have spent on it. So far
i the boys have so concentrated on
their defense that they have forgot
! ten to go out and score enough
: points to win games."
Hancock Shifted to Guard
i There was little of the usual free
j throw practice, and competition
| against the Grays, last night, that
I have characterized previous work
i outs. Bunn started his first string—
i LaCombe, Cosgrove, Packard, Nor
, gard, and Baker—against the second
j string—Glasgow, Palmer, Doub,
j Hancock, and Tod. At the end of
ten minutes he interchanged Doub
j and Hancock with Packard and
I Baker. This combination looked like
I the most promising quintet Bunn
has yet put on the floor.
