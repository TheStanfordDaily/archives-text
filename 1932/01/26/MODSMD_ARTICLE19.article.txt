# TWO BITS FOR A COUPLE IS PRICE OF W A.A. DANCE
## 
### 
Two bits for a couple, twenty
cents for a man, and a dime for
a woman—no cover charges, no
corsages necessary, absolutely
informal—the W.A.A. depres
sion dance next Saturday night
from 9 to 12 in the Roble gym
will be the ideal place for the
Stanford roughs.
Herb Shapiro's orchestra will
furnish the music. "All the
necessities for a good evening's
entertainment," says Marion
Hewlett, committee chairman,
"and you'll still have a couple
of dollars in your pocket when
you get through."
