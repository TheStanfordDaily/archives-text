# CHINESE AVERT SHANGHAI FALL
## Government of Nanking Resigns Over Jap Policy 
### 
SHANGHAI, Jan. 25. (/P;—China's
latest government, aged one month,
broke up today just as negotiations
succeeded in staving off, for a time
at least, the occupation of Shanghai
by Japan.
The two leading members of the
Nanking government — Sun Fo,
chairman of the Executive Yuan
(council), and Eugene Chen, Ameri
can educated foreign minister —re-
signed their posts in protest against
the refusal of their colleagues to
join in a strong anti-Japanese pol
icy. They had advocated severance
of diplomatic relations because of
the conflict in Manchuria.
Shanghai Still Threatened
"China's policy is a vix-tual invita
tion to the Japanese to do as they
please," said Mr. Chen.
The Japanese authorities withheld
orders to proceed with the occupa
tion of Shanghai, but it was be
lieved action along that line might
be expected at any time.
For two hours Mayor Wu Teh-
Chen conferred with Japanese Con
sul-General Murai. The Mayor re
minded him the Tokyo ultimatum
that all anti-Japanese societies be
dissolved was a serious matter and
time was needed to consider it.
M. Murai did not break off the
negotiations, but informed the
Mayor he would request further in
structions from Tokyo and in the
meantime the Chinese authorities
would be held responsible for any
incidents.
Chinese Rush Guards
It was believed the Japanese, who
already have a force of 1700 marines
in Shanghai, doubted t]ie sincerity
of the Chinese and they might bo
expected to press their ultimatum.
Reports that the Japanese planned
to occupy the Chinese international
wireless station on the outskirts of
Shanghai were denied by M. Murai,
but Chinese National Government
troops were placed on guard there.
