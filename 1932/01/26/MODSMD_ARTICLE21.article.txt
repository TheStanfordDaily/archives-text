# HOOVER CLUB PLANS TO ENTER ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN SPRING
## 
### 
Although national political camps
throughout the country fire their
opening guns in the 1932 presiden
tial campaign, the Stanford branch
of the Hoover Thirty-two Club, ac
cording to Joseph R. Nutt, Jr., head
of the unit, will not definitely enter
the campaign to boost the re-elec
tion of Herbert Hoover for the
presidency until spring.
Nutt contemplates no meetings in
Ihe immediate future. With the
spring, though, he expects to have
speakers at the regular sessions of
the club to bolster the campaign
program. In addition to speakers
the club's plans call for the forma
tion of other local Thirty-two units.
Organized as one of a series of
like clubs throughout the nation,
the Stanford branch of the Thirty
two Club consisting of 32 members
was founded last quarter by Nutt
and Wayne Elwood.
