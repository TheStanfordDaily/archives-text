## Charles Ducommun, John Loomis In Tie For Ninth Position TO REVOTE TOMORROW Aylett Cotton, Freshman President, Is Elected 
### 
Election of the new Freshman
Men's Honor Council last night put
eight men into office and resulted
in a tie between two others for a
ninth position.
Charles Boothe, Frank Bowles,
Aylett Cotton, freshman class presi
dent, Charles Flanagan, John Mot
tram, James Savage, Ralph Staver,
and Robert Steiner were elected,
and Charles Ducotnmun and John
Loomib tied for the other place.
Revote Wednesday
A revote for the ninth position
will be held tomorrow night at En
cina Hall as an Encina Club elec
tion, it was announced last night
after the poll. This will be in line
with the policy followed in last
night's vote, the election being con
ducted as a club rather than a class
affair, due to constitutional compli
cations which prevented the elec
tion being held as a class vote.
It is probable that the group's
first meeting will be held after to
morrow night's election. The new
body, which is entirely the result
of freshman initiative, was selected
from ,i group of 20 candidates se
lected by Men's Council from a
large number of nominees suggested
by the freshmen.
Seek Perfect Record
The aim of the new council is a
perfect four-year record for honor
able conduct within the class. Fresh
man leaders felt that members of
their class would more readily re
port violations to a freshman group
than to such a body as Men's Coun
cil, and that a more positive realiza
tion of the principles involved in
the Honor Code could be instilled
into a smaller, more compact group
than is the case with attempts to
educate the entire student body in
Honor Code processes.
