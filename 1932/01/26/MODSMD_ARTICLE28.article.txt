# THEY CALL IT JOURNALISM

it has been a long time—two months, to be exact —since
the Daily lias commented on the Call-Bulletin tactics in
connection with Stanford news. The Daily has long ago
given up the idea of accomplishing anything by so com
menting, so that it will merely state the facts of the case in
point, and allow the reader to form his own conclusions.
Proceeding from the cart to the horse, the facts are
these: Yesterday afternoon, the Call-Bulletin's late edition
blazoned out with thr following 108-point Gothic, two-line
streamer. "COFDS' VISIT TO STANFORD DORM
STARTS RJOT"
I tu story, in cuiuiuii mil*, wtiisuie right, told >>i iv/o co
eds, said to be Stanford women, violating all rules by visit
ing Toyon Hall, and the subsequent protest in yesterday's
('.ampus Opinion column by Edwin E. Williams. Now Wil
liams' letter was unfortunately worded, enabling the Call-
Bulletin to pick up certain paragraphs, written in evident
sarcasm, but employing such phrases as "sexual repression
and perversion," "girls driven from the room," and the like.
That the Call-Bulletin desk men were particularly care
ful to pick out only those isolated paragraphs that would
make good reading is evidenced by the fact that in an
earlier edition the paper ran, under a smaller head, the
same story without the streamer. It is evident that later in
the day the Call desk, hard up for a streamer, picked out a
few.of the jucier phrases, dressed up the story and hung
the screaming headline on it, thereby selling out the late
edition in Palo Alto.
The actual facts are these: On Saturday night, three
students, accompanied by three girls, ftone of them Stan
ford co-eds, entered a Toyon room after the basketball
game. They left in fifteen minutes, but not until an ac
quaintance of one of the youths concerned had seen them
enter, had roused numerous other residents of the hall and
they had congregated outside the room to hand out to tin*
fellows mentioned above a good, hearty razzing.
The whole incident was uncalled-for, ill-mannered and
u rank discourtesy to the three girls. There was nothing
to call forth howls of "sexual repression"; it was merely
the thoughtless act of a group of fellows who forgot, for
the moment, that they were Stanford gentlemen. To that
charge, they must plead guilty, but to nothing else.
In the second, place, the three youths who brought the
girls into the hall were not breaking any regulations. The
University rules prohibit a Stanford woman going into a
fraternitv or a dormitorv room UNACCOMPANIED bv an
other Stanford woman; obviously, three non-University
women, accompanied by their escorts, shattered no rules
set up by Stanford. Also, there is nothing in the Toyon
Club constitution to bar women and their escorts from visit
ing the rooms, although, it must be admitted, they rarely
do except on Sunday.
The Toyon Cabinet, meeting last night, declared that no
possible suspicion could be attached to the actions of the
three members and that both Williams' letter to the Daily
and the Call-Bulletin's version of the affair were gross
misrepresentations.
In conclusion, the Daij.y can say only this: The Call-
Bulletin is looking for every possible chance to sully the
name of Stanford University, and is making the most of
those opportunities. Their story of yesterday, if not a direct
twisting of the facts, was a distortion of the news value
with the aim of hurting Stanford. That is made much more
distinct when one learns that the Daily News, the other San
Francisco evening paper, turned down the story altogether
and refused to print a line of it. Perhaps that may give one
a clearer picture of the Call-Bulletin and the place it oc
cupies in decent journalism.
"College students are cynical about the purity of ath
letes, college women, marriage as an institution, President
Hoover's logic, William Randolph Hearst's motives, and
the ingredients of bootleg gin, college textbooks and all
wool socks; thev are suspicious of tobacco advertisements,
generalities about the younger generation, school spirit,
"Rugged Individualism," and the honesty of their fraternity
brothers.
Rut they are idealistic about themselves and their own
possibilities. Ignorance is bliss. The Daily California/}.
