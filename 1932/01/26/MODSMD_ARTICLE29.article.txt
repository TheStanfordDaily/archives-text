# BULL SESSION
## IT PAYS TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE 
### 
Nobody likes adverse criticism— j
especially those that ask for it. i
Consequently those that attack j
things let nothing out of the pro- :
cess except personal satisfaction;
and the reported inner glow of in- i
tellectual honesty that comes to j
those who feel they have done !
right. Those, however, who can get :
superlative over anything at all, are |
showered with all sorts of things .
besides anonymous letters. Thus, j
we feel sure that the Dramatic j
Council will offer us reviewer's !
seats for what is to follow. If they
do, we will have no qualms in ac- |
cepting for we are expressing genu- ;
ine opinion; arid not advertising!
ballyhoo.
Amateur productions are usually |
terrifically boring to everybody but j
the parents of the actors. A stage is 1
something artificial and amateur j
actors are the height of artificiality, j
Therefore, when we went to our
first Stanford play, a corking lead j
for next morning's story was just i
buzzing through our mind. It was {
perfectly devastating. Imagine our
disappointment when we were forced :
to shelve the whole thing. That
same process has gone on every j
time we have gone to see a campus \
production.
Of course, we have not seen all
of them. Now, for most people a
lead sentence is just a thing apart, i
but for would-be-journalists and j
journalists it is their whole life, i
gloat on good leads and are
pushed to the very depths of black j

] despair by a poor one. To shelve a
' preconceived one takes the strong
! est of circumstances.
If "Bird In Hand" is as good as
j ihe other Stanford productions we
' have seen, it will be worth seeing.
! If it is a typical amateur produc
| tion, it will be worth while to toss
j pennies at it. Two recommendations
i lor the play are past campus plays
i and John Drinkwater. If the play
j turns out to be a dud, we can all
I whistle, throw airplanes, and toss
| coins. The threat of these possible
! unfortunate happenings should spur
• Ihe players on to new heights.
While it is probably justifiable to
! give the razz where the razz is due,
i in justice to the students who have
| spent endless hours in memorizing
! lines, actions — everything, even
' when to breathe —let us hold the
I audience's great retaliatory weapon
j until the dirt has been done. There
J is a good possibility that "Bird In
[ Hand" will pass off the stage with
| out th'_» typical "rough" trimmings.
I '
Don't go to this show thinking
that a "Bird In Hand" is worth two
in the bush. Very often one would
wish that all the birds were in the
bush—preferably some far-off bush.
Whether the Bird in the Hand will
be matched with "birds" from the
gallery will be decided next Friday.
We should all be on hand to partici
pate in the pleasure of a good play;
or the more basic but equally pleas
urable activity of razzing a poor
one. —Abe Mellinkofi'
