THE DIABOLIST. Volume I, Num
ber 1. Privately Printed. January
1932.
This publication began as the
literary mag of the Scroll and
Stylus, College of th*> Pacific liter
ary organization. But some modem
odors and rr-l violent, editorials
brought ir, mutr-r faculty brm.
Published privately it is discovered
to be neither lethal nor prepos
sessing, but occasionally amusing.
The editor, it would appear, began
with a literary policy and then went
adolescently journalistic, wielding
his pen in the several and danger
ous causes surrounding censorship
and faculty.
Some light poetry by Janice
Dixon, sonnets by E. Eugene Bone,
and sketches by Don Stanford, Gene
Cady, Bob Linn, and Carol Carring
ton prove the publication's chief as
sets.
The book is that stimulating and
not infrequent joy: youth at violent
play, assailing tradition, struggling
for eternally lost causes, and ready
to do or die for dear old ....
An interesting experiment, some
what over-informal, too often ex
hibiting "modern" touches, with a
redundancy of adjectives, occasion
ally losing itself in wrath—but ex
hibiting enough cleverness to be en
tertaining. —J.S.S.

X MARKS THE SPOT—At the
Menlo Theatre.

What starts out to be a depress
ingly limp movie version of metro
politan newspaper atmosphere—the
real stuff, you know, with hard
boiled city editors, wise-cracking
reporters, etc. —surprisingly loosens
up early in the picture, and gal
vanizes itself somehow into sus
jj< nst-, iiiyst' ry, : rid. drriin <, with the
"killer' motif much in. view.
it is jiot at all bad. I'lie climax,
with Fred Kohler as the "killer,"
trapped but still fighting, scream
ing "rat" and "double crosser," and
the star reporter nobly hurling him
self into what seems certain death,
holds an unexpected potency.

THIS MAN'S ART—By Walton Hal!
Smith. Published by Doubleday
—Doran. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Love among the artists. Byron
Hill decides in his youth to gain a
certain amount of glory by strug
gling 10 become a sculptor and,
strangely enough, is well adapted
to the type of artistry.
His relations with the Chapman
family, Rex and Marcia, his school
boy antics, his love affair with Abbe
Priest—then others, and finally
Stephanie, final in the sense that
he marries her—all these incidents
to show that his artistic tempera
ment requires an ever-renewed
stimulus. First, his art, then love,
then the woman —most any woman
who is beautiful. —E.E.H.
