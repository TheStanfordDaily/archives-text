MORE ABOUT READERS
The Editor, Sir:
The comment by the two gentle
men in the Campus Opinion of your
paper for January 19 was appre
ciated, and I ask the privilege of
adding my thoughts concerning
readers to theirs.
A reader should be well versed in
the field for which the work is
done. Better still, some practical ex
perience in this field aids in im
proving the theoretical with practi
cal training, which occasionally al
ters the interpretation of papers.
Readers should have sufficient time
to devote to a careful study of each
paper read. Above all, the reader
should have had the course or its
equivalent before undertaking the
work, and If at all possible, from the
professor giving the work in order
that this viewpoint may be gaineck
If this is not possible, all other
qualificftions being high, the reader
should be required to audit the
course. It is advisable to limit both
the number of papers read and the
number of courses for which the
reading may be done in any one
quarter.
It is suggested in connection with
the previous article that a commit
tee of a faculty representative from
each department and a reader nomi
nated from each department make
a thorough and impartial study of
the problem and make recommenda
tions to the administration by whom
corrective measures may be evolved;
also, that a more selective method
of choosing readers be developed.
