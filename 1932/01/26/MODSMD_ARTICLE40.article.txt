This afternoon's heats will in
clude the 50- and 100-yard free

tiie 150-yard backstroke. Seeding
has been arranged so that the fa
vorites in each race will meet in
the Thursday finals, when the pub
lie will be admitted free.
Seniors Favored
With many varsity men on the
fourth year's squad, the seniors are
highly favored to take the meet
without a great deal of trouble, fol
lowed probably by the sophomores.
Water polo counts in the interclass
scores, with the result that last
week's games place the seniors in
the lead already, with ten points to
iheir credit, as against six for the
second-year men, four for the
babes, and two for the juniors.
Advance dope has it that four of
the final races Thursday will be in
doubt until the tankmen actually
touch the end of the pool. If no up
set:, mar today's preliminary heats,
Tuppy Gardner, Coast Intercollegi
ate champion in the 100 and rec
ord-holder for the Pacific Coast in
both the 100 and 50, will meet John

Clapp, VViget in reauoe
Another feature Thursday will be
the Clapp-Wiget duel in the 220 and
440. Clapp, National Intercollegiate
champion in the 220 and senior na
tional AA.U. champion in the 500,
will have no easy time keeping his
head in front of the up-and-coming
• ophomore star in both races, espe
cially in the longer distance.
Clark and Harris will fight it out
in the breaststroke, another race
that should end in a close one for
the stop watches. Clark recently
broke unofficially the national 300-
yard medley record, which includes
his specialty, the backstroke.
In th'? breaststroke battle Rogers
and Tebbetts will probably scram
ble for second place behind Captain
Frank Booth. Besides these two
races and the free-style events,
there will be only the medley relay
and diving. The latter, which takes
place tomorrow at 1 o'clock, is
closed to the public, but a short
diving exhibition will add to the
swimfest the next day.
