# MacDonald Smith Plays Better Brand of Golf Than Fred Morrison But Is $3,000 Poorer

### 
The two big annual winter golf!
tournaments of the Pacific Coast
have come and gone, leaving Mac
donald Smith richer by §2,000 and
Fred Morrison wealthier by $5000.
Yet, Mac played better golf than
Fred, and 'tis a pity that the veteran

while Morrison's 284 at Agua Cali
ente was in itself a sensational per
formance. Morrison, by the way, ex
plained the improved scores at Cali
ente this year by the fact that the
rules permitted them to improve i
their lies for the second shot on
long holes, and because the greens
were in much better condition. j
So Mac, the old-timer, and Fred, i
the comparative youth (he's 31),
picked up a nice wad of California
gold by shooting better golf than j
any of the other competitors in the
respective tournaments. With Tom
my Armour, who was first in the
Miami open, they are the biggest I

winners of the 1932 golf season. Mac
Smith, who shot rounds of 69, 68,
72, and 72 at Hillcrest, was forced
to withdraw from the Mexican tour
nament on account of a bad cold.
Morrison, who represents the Fox
Hills Club of Culver City, got hot
right off the bat at Agua Caliente,

Mac Smith won for finishing first in
the Los Angeles Open, and has now
collected $13,000 in three tourna
ments on this 6.838-yard course in
Old Mexico!
It's queer how Macdonald Smith
goes on showing up the other pros
in so many tournaments, yet is
never able to win an American or a
British Open crown. He tied for
first in the U.S. Open, in 1910 (with
his brother Aleck and J. J. McDer
nott) and he's still going strong.
Maybe the jinx that has followed
him in national competitions for so
long will depart in 1932!
