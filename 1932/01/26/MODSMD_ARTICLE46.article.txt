# POLE VAULTERS ARE STRONG FEATURE OF TRACK TEAM; MAY BEAT TROJANS
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
Forty feet of vaulting ability di- ]
vided more or less equally between
three experts with the bamboo pole, j
and an extra twelve feet three l
inches thrown in for good measure
—that it. the material that faces J
Dink Templeton in the pole-vault ,
this coming season. The three men :
whose best marks total an even
two-score feet are Bert DeGroot.
Bill Milter, and Ned Johns, and the
fourth vaulter is Buck Van Dellen.
DeGroot has been Stanford's '
leading exponent of the art of i
climbing poles for two seasons, and
last year vaulted thirteen feet
inches on two occasions. Bert won
ihe pole-vault in the Big Meet and
he tied for third in the 1.C.4-A., '
being beaten by Graber of U.S.C.
and Berlinger of Pennsylvania.
Although Berlinger has graduated,
Graber is very much in evidence, :
and DeGroot will get at least two
more chances to defeat the pride of
the Cromwell clan in the Trojan- !
Indian dual meet and in this year's
1.C.4-A. meet. DeGroot was con
sistent all during the 1931 season, ,
and managed to vault thirteen feet |
or better in every meet in which he I
paiticipated. |
Miller, who entered Stanford this j
quarter after a two-year sojourn at |
Menlo Junior College, flashed into 1
national prominence in 1928 when {
he set a new world's interscholastic j
record. That occurred when Bill j
was competing for San Diego High
School, and his record of thirteen j
feet two and five-eighths inches
stood until 1930.
Like DeGroot, Miller has re- j
corded thirteen feet six inches on I
more than one occasion. He has!
worked out under Templeton some- ]
what during the past two years, so
that ho is not entirely unfamiliar
with Dink's method of coaching.
Miller i« considered one of the
country's best prospects in the pole
vault, and the meeting between
Miller, DeGroot, and Graber may
result in a new world's record.

Like many other Indian track
stars, Johns has been bothered with
injuries while attending Stanford.
However, Ned got himself in good
enough shape to place in the Big
Meet for two years straight, and
vaulted thirteen feet both times.
While competing for Huntington
Park High School, Johns tied for
third in the same Southern Cali
fornia interscholastic meet in which
Miller set his new world's record.'
Second place in that meet went to
Jefferson, who is now vaulting for
U.C.L.A., and the man who tied
Johns was Cchlentzos of U.S.C.
As a freshman, Johns set a new
Little Big Meet record of twelve
feet four and one-half inches. Ned
has already cleared thirteen feet
this year, and should enjoy his best
season.
Van Dellen brought the C.C.A.L.
pole-vault record with him when
he entered Stanford, his high-scho6i
mark being eleven feet ten inches.
Buck showed that this mark was no
fluke when he won his specialty in
ihe Little Big Meet last year.

Little Big Meet record of twelve
feet four and one-half inches. Ned
has already cleared thirteen feet
this year, and should enjoy his best
season.
Van Dellen brought the C.C.A.L.
pole-vault record with him when
he entered Stanford, his high-scho6i
mark being eleven feet ten inches.
Buck showed that this mark was no
fluke when he won his specialty in
ihe Little Big Meet last year.
Forty feet of vaulting ability di- ]
vided more or less equally between
three experts with the bamboo pole, j
and an extra twelve feet three l
inches thrown in for good measure
—that it. the material that faces J
Dink Templeton in the pole-vault ,
this coming season. The three men :
whose best marks total an even
two-score feet are Bert DeGroot.
Bill Milter, and Ned Johns, and the
fourth vaulter is Buck Van Dellen.
DeGroot has been Stanford's '
leading exponent of the art of i
climbing poles for two seasons, and
last year vaulted thirteen feet
inches on two occasions. Bert won
ihe pole-vault in the Big Meet and
he tied for third in the 1.C.4-A., '
being beaten by Graber of U.S.C.
and Berlinger of Pennsylvania.
Although Berlinger has graduated,
Graber is very much in evidence, :
and DeGroot will get at least two
more chances to defeat the pride of
the Cromwell clan in the Trojan- !
Indian dual meet and in this year's
1.C.4-A. meet. DeGroot was con
sistent all during the 1931 season, ,
and managed to vault thirteen feet |
or better in every meet in which he I
paiticipated. |
Miller, who entered Stanford this j
quarter after a two-year sojourn at |
Menlo Junior College, flashed into 1
national prominence in 1928 when {
he set a new world's interscholastic j
record. That occurred when Bill j
was competing for San Diego High
School, and his record of thirteen j
feet two and five-eighths inches
stood until 1930.
Like DeGroot, Miller has re- j
corded thirteen feet six inches on I
more than one occasion. He has!
worked out under Templeton some- ]
what during the past two years, so
that ho is not entirely unfamiliar
with Dink's method of coaching.
Miller i« considered one of the
country's best prospects in the pole
vault, and the meeting between
Miller, DeGroot, and Graber may
result in a new world's record.

Like many other Indian track
stars, Johns has been bothered with
injuries while attending Stanford.
However, Ned got himself in good
enough shape to place in the Big
Meet for two years straight, and
vaulted thirteen feet both times.
While competing for Huntington
Park High School, Johns tied for
third in the same Southern Cali
fornia interscholastic meet in which
Miller set his new world's record.'
Second place in that meet went to
Jefferson, who is now vaulting for
U.C.L.A., and the man who tied
Johns was Cchlentzos of U.S.C.
