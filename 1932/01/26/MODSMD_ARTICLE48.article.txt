## GREAT STUFF, NIBS! 
### 
NIBS PRICE, California's basket- '
ball coach, commenting' on Satur
day night's fracas:
'it may not have been all
good basketball in the finest
sense of the word, but I am sure
that 3000 spectators went away
satisfied that they had had a
good evening's entertainment.
.... There was no stalling.
There was action every minute,
and as long as I am coaching a
basketball team I intend to
give the fans that kind of a
game."
Well, Nibs, that's the stuff that's
i going to keep up the interest in
| this game of basketball. That's the
Muff that will pack auditoriums to
! capacity to see your teams in action.
We don't imagine that Caddy
Works found time to read a news
| paper during the recent California- ;
; U.C.L.A. engagement, as he did for
16 minutes during his game with |
I U.S.C. the other night. And we
didn't hear of any shower of pennies
j and programs.
THE ONLY REASON that the
' Stanford-Southern California games
j weren't featured by long periods of
! stalling such as that 16-minute "in
termission" at Los Angeles Satur- '
day night was because Coach John
Bunn sent the Indians after the
unpopular invaders.
A hint of what MIGHT have
occurred was that three- or
four-minute stretch when t?.e
Farm quintet laid back and al- i
lowed the Trojans to present
their stalling act, just by way
of showing that it was Stanford
! that made those two games what
' they were. I
:
Of course, there is one angle l
' fbout 'his game- that "Silent Smu'*
'->,•( vv i, in'hirs The crowds mav j

'continue to turn out to see the Tro- j
jans, but it will be in the same j
I spirit that boxing fans will flock to !
see an unpopular fighter— to see him !
BEATEN.
IT LOOKS LIKE a natural, this
Bear-Trojan engagement at Oakland !
Friday and Saturday nights—a na
tural because California has an ex
cellent chance to take the division
lead away from the Southerners, .
and a natural because a popular 1
team will be meeting an unpopular
1 one.
California still didn't per
form up to capacity in stopping
the Indians last Saturday, prin
cipally because the lads with
the big scoring guns couldn't
find the basket as in clays of
yore.
: But they showed improvement i
over early season, those Bears, and j
I they showed signs of greater things i
to come. It's our guess that the !
Trojans are due for a couple of !
cleanings, if Price can smooth up j
his machine a bit more this week.
t* ♦ I
"CLEAN ROUGHNESS," of the
type which featured the Bear-In- I
dian clash the other night, is not !
• too objectionable, but it seems to j
1 this department that smoother play i
I would make for even greater speed, I
i more scoring, and a better game for j
! ihe fans. I
The officials, of course, have
to use discretion, or both teams
! would soon be eliminated from
| the game, but it is entirely pos
i sible to keep play under better
control than it was Saturday.

'it may not have been all

j weren't featured by long periods of

unpopular invaders.
