Vityting 14 college and university
dining halls and almost as many j
girls' dormitories was the experi- ;
ence of Miss Christine Bicker, di- j
rector of dining halls, on her return
trip from Boston, where she spent
the Christmas vacation. Miss Ricker ;

"The Stanford board is lower than i
in almost any other university," she I
stated. "The girl hashers as we have
them here are unusual in a uni- \
versity, I have discovered. In most !
universities they have men students j
as hashers. At Princeton there is .
one dining room with student hash- :
ers, another with a combination of
student hashers and professional
waitresses, and another with entire- j
1> professional waitresses; so you
can take your pick.
"The custom of requiring the j
freshmen to eat in a definite place,
as we do at Encina, is similar to !
that in almost every university," she
continued. "At Princeton, this rule
applies to sophomores, also."
