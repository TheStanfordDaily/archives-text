Oklahoma's picturesque governor, W. H. "Alfalfa Bill" Murray,
didn't exactly toss his hat in the presidential ring while in Washington
but he did outline the platform on which he believes the democratic
nominee should stand. He also verbally measured some of the potential
candidates. He is shown here (right) with Rep. Tom McKeown of
Oklahoma. H: made the trip to testify before a house committee on
tax matters.
