## Judge Withholds Decision In Moot Court Case 
### 
Marked by frequent clashes be- !
i 'tween attorneys and judge over ;
points of lav/ and precedent, the i
first Irial of the second round of I
moot court ended with the judge,
' Robert Littler, San Francisco, at
j torney and Stanford Law School
1 graduate, taking the case under ad
visement in order that the briefs
I submitted could be more fully ex
amined.
Littler promised that a decision j
would be forthcoming not later than i
; tomorrow.
The case at bar involved a breach j
| of contract in which the appellant !
had agreed to work for 12 months |
j and had quit his job after four
j months' work. He sued to recover |
i salary for the time he worked.
Perry Churchill and Douglas j
! Clark Gregg, attorneys for the ap- I
I pellant, maintained that their "con
! tention was supported by reason
I and intrinsic justice" and that "the
appellant should be allowed the
value for four months' service less j
I damage incurred for breach of con- j
j tract."
, They maintained that the law of |
| contracts aims to compensate rather
i than punish a breach of contract. (
| There were frequent clashes be- j
tween the attorneys for the appel- ;
Unit and the judge regarding the |
| question of the application of judge- j
made ot case law and legislative J

i tained that a servant who abandons I
i without sufficient cause the per
formance of a contract under which j
he is bound to work for a definite i
period cannot recover, by reason of j
| the contract, for the period he did I
| work.
! Attorneys for the defendant as- j
1 sorted that the weight of court pre- '
| cedent and case rulings was in their |
j favor, which was admitted by i
Churchili and Gregg.
