# MENTOR WAGES WAR ON U.S.C. STALLING PLAY
## Bunn Will Ask N.A.B.C. To Outlaw Guard Control Hoop Tactics NIBS WANTS FAST PLAY "It May Be Legal But It's Not Basketball," Says Indian Cage Coach 
### Lowell Cox 
War on the stalling or "guard I
control" type of basketball, as
played by the University of South
ern California Trojans, was de
clared last night by John Bunn,
Stanford coach.
Believing that the popularity of '
the game is threatened by this type
of play, which has become more
objectionable this season than ever ]
before, the Indian cage mentor sig- j
nified his intention of demanding
legislation against it at the annual ;
meeting of the National Association '
of Basketball Coaches to be held j
this spring.
"Under the present rules it is |
legal, but it isn't basketball," he 1
declared, referring to the numerous |
occasions this season on which the I
Trojans have held up games for 1
long periods when they took slight â– 
leads over their opponents.
Slows Game
"Such tactics will kill off basket
ball, will kill off attendance," he '
said. "The National Association of
Basketball Coaches, realizing that
the life of the game is based on .
speed, has already condemned any
thing that tends to slow it up. It is
evident that this is not sufficient,
and I intend to ask the association j
to recommend definite legislation I
against the stalling game to the I
rules committee."
That the Trojans have been high
ly unpopular with basketball fans j
on the coast this year has been evi- j
dcnced not only in the series here |
but in all their games. When in j
their opening game with U.C.L.A. i
in Los Angeles Saturday night they i
held up play for 16 minutes after '
taking a 5 to 2 lead, the crowd
showered the floor with pennies and |
programs and howled for action. I
Stalling Questioned
As the rules now stand the game '
taught by "Silent Sam" Barry is 1
legal, as responsibility for breaking i
up stalling of this type is placed on
ihe team behind in the score.
Bunn proposes to limit the time !
during which an unguarded player
may hold the ball to 15 seconds, and
to design the ruling so that the two j
guards may not nullify the value ,
of this by merely tossing the ball
back and forth. The penalty at- '
tached would be the awarding of j
ihe ball out of bounds to the de- i
fensive team.
The Indian coach feels, however, |
that stalling within the last five ,
minutes of play is a legitimate part
of the game, as the defensive team i
will always try to break it up, thus !
keeping up the speed of the game. !
His proposed ruling would not apply
to this period.
Backing Expected
In the event that the rules com
mittee does not take action, Bunn
believes that the Pacific Coast Con
ference should take the lead in ,
stopping this kind of play before
interest in coast basketball is de- j
stroyed.
It is believed that Bunn will be
backed in his action not only by I
Stanford athletic authorities, but by '
Ihe other coaches in the conference, i
with the exception, of course, of
Barry.
Nibs Price of California has al
ready gone on record as favoring
fast basketball, as opposed to the !
stalling game.
