# W.A.A. TAKES FIRST STEP FOR WOMEN'S HOOP COMPETITION
## 
### 
Intercollegiate competition for
women may finally materialize this
quarter if plans for upper and
lower division basketball games
with San Jose State College as out
lined at the W.A.A. Board meeting
last night are successfully com
pleted.
An invitation for a night contest
tc be played the latter part of Feb
ruary or the first of March has been
sent, ilthough no answer has been
received as yet. According to the
new plan, two games would be
played, one between teams com
posed of members of the lower divi
sion of each school and the other
between teams of upper division
students. This is viewed as a de
cided step forward from the system
used in the Triangular Sports Day
held autumn quarter in which class
teams of one schcool played dif
ferent class teams of another school.
"The establishment of this new
system would constitute a violation
of the spirit of the A.C.A.C.W.
standards which frowns upon inter
collegiate competition for women,"
declared Jane Snyder, W.A.A.
president. "However, if bay colleges
are willing to compete on this basis
during a trial period for the rest of
the year, we may be able to install
the plan successfully at Stanford."
