# Dr. De Sitter Reviews Plan Of Relativity
## Proton Reduction Given As Fundamental Thesis 
### 
"If all the matter in our universe
were reduced to protons we would
have approximately the figure eight,
followed by 78 zeros, as the num
ber of protons in the universe," de
clared Dr. Willem de Sitter, leading
astronomer and colleague of Ein
stein, in an address before a large
| group in the Assembly Hall last,
night.
"Our present theory of an ox
i panding universe, based on Ein
j stein's relativity is correct as far as
i it goes. It is not complete as yet,
j however, and we cannot predict
. what that completion will be.
"The nebulae systems which we
observe are in reality duplications
j of our own galactic system," Dr. de
j Sitter declared. "There are many
j millions of these systems in the uni-
I verse. They aK> all very nearly alike
j and our nearest neighbor is about
one million light years away."
1 If we were to place an observer
; nut in space, according to Dr. de
I Sitter, our own galactic system,
j which is perhaps 200,000 light years
' across, appears flat like a disk and
| is very similar to other spiral nebu
j lae which may be observed through
: telescopes.
He pointed out that our universe
"cohsistes mostly of emptiness." If
we were to reduce everything to
atoms of hydrogen, ancl distribute
; the mass evenly, we would have an
| emptiness greater than the most
perfect vacuum ever achieved.
According to present theory, our
j universe is constantly expanding
i outward. It originally started as a
j static or stable universe with a ra
\ dius of about 1000 million light
i years. At the present time, Dr. de
i Sitter says that it is about <wice as
I large.
He pointed out that Einstein's
theory of relativity is not a revo
! lutionary train of thought but
! rather the logical sequence of the
i line of thought begun by Archi
i medes and Galileo.
Dr. de Sitter came to the United
I States last September at the request
| of President Sproul of the Univcr
| sity of California. He has made
| many contributions in the field of
| astronomy and is particularly noted
I for his critical work on the theory
j of relativity.

Dr. de Sitter came to the United
I States last September at the request
| of President Sproul of the Univcr
| sity of California. He has made
| many contributions in the field of
| astronomy and is particularly noted
I for his critical work on the theory
j of relativity.
"If all the matter in our universe
were reduced to protons we would
have approximately the figure eight,
followed by 78 zeros, as the num
ber of protons in the universe," de
clared Dr. Willem de Sitter, leading
astronomer and colleague of Ein
stein, in an address before a large
| group in the Assembly Hall last,
night.
"Our present theory of an ox
i panding universe, based on Ein
j stein's relativity is correct as far as
i it goes. It is not complete as yet,
j however, and we cannot predict
. what that completion will be.
"The nebulae systems which we
observe are in reality duplications
j of our own galactic system," Dr. de
j Sitter declared. "There are many
j millions of these systems in the uni-
I verse. They aK> all very nearly alike
j and our nearest neighbor is about
one million light years away."
1 If we were to place an observer
; nut in space, according to Dr. de
I Sitter, our own galactic system,
j which is perhaps 200,000 light years
' across, appears flat like a disk and
| is very similar to other spiral nebu
j lae which may be observed through
: telescopes.
He pointed out that our universe
"cohsistes mostly of emptiness." If
we were to reduce everything to
atoms of hydrogen, ancl distribute
; the mass evenly, we would have an
| emptiness greater than the most
perfect vacuum ever achieved.
According to present theory, our
j universe is constantly expanding
i outward. It originally started as a
j static or stable universe with a ra
\ dius of about 1000 million light
i years. At the present time, Dr. de
i Sitter says that it is about <wice as
I large.
