# Unique Scientific Beast Analyzes Living Matter

### JOE GRAVES 
Half way around the world, trav
eling over two continents and across
one ocean, to test a scientific ma
chine built at a cost of $41,000 —the-
only apparatus of its kind in the
world—a machine capable of separ
ating matter such as soap into its
elementary, component parts.
Such is the unusual trip from
which Dr. and Mrs. J. W. Mcßain
of the Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, recently returned. The Mo-
Bains undertook the experiment to
gether with the aim of producing
an instrument which could analyze
living matter, and which would be
inexpensive enough for use in most
laboratories.
The unique machine was devel
oped by Professor Svedberg at the
University of Upsala in Sweden.
For this invention he received the
Nobel prize iti chemistry.
Capable of producing a centrifu

j yal force 100,000 times as strong as
gravity, it separates the constitu
ents of the cell under observation.
The center cone of the machine re
volves at a speed of 44,000 revolu
tions per minute.
Two large rooms in the Chemistry
Building are filled with the ma
chinery to produce this tremendous
speed. Alter starting, it takes more
than an hour for the rotary cone in
i the center to reach maximum speed,
j The din created by the operation
I of the machinery is terrific.
The machine, which is of the oil
turbine type, represents a great en
| gineering feat as well as advance
j ment in the fields of physical and
collodial chemistry, according to
Mrs. Mcßain. Lubricating problems
I and the maintenance of constant
I temperature and a low vacuum were
| the greatest engineering difficulties
, to be overcome.
