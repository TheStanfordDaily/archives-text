# JAY TOD JOINS GROWING HOOP HOSPITAL LIST
## Bunn Tries Packard, Doub, And Jenkins At Center And Guard Posts U.C.L.A. IS NEXT FOE Cordry May Be In Shape To Boost Scoring Average Against Westwood 
### Bob Wade 
With Jay Tod added to the grow
ing list of sick and injured, Coach
John Bunn moved Charlie Beaver
up from the grays to fill in at his
guard post, and continued the hard
scrimmages which have been in
order this week.
Bunn it; still experimenting with
his three centers, Doub, Packard,
and Jenkins, and for awhile tried
Jenkins out at guard with Baker.
Jenkins and Packard, playing on
the same team, gives Bunn about
as much height as any quintet in
the conference. But the smoothest
five that he has tried yet is the
Norgard, Hancock, Doub, Cosgrove,
and LaCombe combination.
So far Ihe practice scrimmages
have been outstanding only for the
scarcity of baskets made. The re
cent setback at the hands of the*
Bears and Trojans seem to have
left the varsity players bereft of
anything even remotely resembling
their "shooting eyes." Until they get
their accuracy back it is hard to
tell how Bunn's offense will stack
up against Coach Caddy Works' re
juvenated Bruins next week-end.
Piper Surges Ahead
According to the reports of
U.S.C.'s recent defeat by the West
wood outfit, Don Piper, their new
forward, is o.utscoring his running
mate, Captain "Tricky Dick" Lin
thicum. It was Piper who put the
Trojan game on ice with a pair of
long-range baskets just before the
gun sounded. In fact U.C.L.A. fans
are hailing him as another Von
Hagen, the forward who caused
Stanford so much trouble last year.
It is still doubtful whether "Tiny
Tom" Cordry can take his place in
the line-up before the last two
games of the Trojan series next
week. The injured leg is not hcf»l
ing any too fast, and Bunn will not
take a chance on losing the diminu
tive star for the rest of the season
by playing him before the hone is
entirely strong. With Cordry back
in the lme-up, however, the Stan
ford fiv«; would much greater
chance of upsetting their rivals in
one or both of the games Friday
and Saturday.
Doub Back
The illness which laid Bill Don I)
up for the better part of two weeks
seems to have entirely vanished,
and his play this week mark" him
as a possible starter at the pivot
position. What he lacks in reach is
made up for by his fight, floorwork,
and ability to get the ball off the
backboard. With the blond center
back on the team, and Jack Han
cock shifted to Edclen's guard posi
tion, the Indians present a heavier
quintet which is equally as fine a
'scoring machine, and with very lit
itle less speed, than the one which
| faced California last Saturday.
Still Title Chancc
Stanford will have to win all its
, remaining games to have much
chance for the conference litle, and
they are tackling no door-mat when
i they run into the Bruins of West
wood. The Southerners do not go
,n for the stalling tactics which
lheir opponets of last Saturday em-
I ployed, and the fans around Los
Angeles are said to be looking for
ward eagerly to seeing 40 full min
utes of basketball crammed into one
j evening.
Stanford went after Troy's guards
|and lost; the Bruins stayed in their
1 own half of the court and won; hut
Stanford beat U.C.L.A. in the first
I two games of the scries.
