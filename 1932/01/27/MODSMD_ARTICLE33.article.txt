# BULL SESSION
## JOURNALISM AND THE CALL-BULLETIN 
### 
The campus was shocked when a |
flaming headline streamed across
the Call-Bulletin informing God, 1
San Francisco, and everybody that I
naughty things were happening at |
Stanford University—alma mater of J
(he President, of the Secretary of j
the Interior, and of many of the j
City's best and most respected. The j
Call probably knew that the story j
wasn't true; but they also knew !
something else. They knew that a j
headline combining girls and Stan- j
ford would sell papers so fast it ■
would make the respectable News i
look very weak indeed.
We, here in college, condemn the j
Call's story very severely. It is!
probably right that we should have j
such an attitude. There is no doubt r
that the printing of that story was j
unethical. The question arises, how- I
ever, do newspapers have ethics? I
Does journalism have an ethical I
standard any longer? We usually j
associate ethics with a profession;
journalism isn't a profession. It is a j
mixture of big business and crafts- :
manship. Big Business on the part •
of the owners and craftsmanship on ;
the part of the staff. Have we a j
right to expect high ethical conduct |
from such a combination?
Fremont Older, the editor of the I
Call, once had the reputation of j
being one of the most liberal and i
high-minded editors in America. He
no doubt is still liberal and still j
high-minded in his personal life. He j
has come to the realization, how- j
ever, that liberality and ethics do ;
not sell papers. Papers must be sold. :
The staggering operating and fixed
expenses of a metropolitan paper !
must be met. Consequently, Older 1

puts out a paper that has swallowed
up one evening competitor and
overshadows the other one in cir
culation by thousands.
For the Call, journalism is a busi
ness. College men and women ex-
I pect a business organization to
| maintain high ethical norms. It is
| comparable to tasking a Mexican
I hairless to grow Angora Wool. It is
| asking the impossible. We hav& seen
with regret idealistic college jour-
I nalists go to work for papers that
i would make the Call-Bulletin look
j like the Christian Science Monitor.
! They had to in order to exist. In
' several years, their college ethics
i had vanished into the giant rotary
! presses and the huge fixed invest
t ment.
This writer has always hoped that
I newspapers could be more than
j giant corporations—whose sole pur
j pose was profits — just like the
American Tobacco Company, Gen
eral Motors, or U.S. Steel. This last
incident with the Call-Bulletin is
just one more shot at that idealistic
| hope. Everybody realizes that
| "Stanford" is good news; everybody
! realizes that anything even inti
i mating something sexy will set the
| suppressed imaginations of the
I ribbon clerks and garage mechanics
j whirrling like airplane propellers;
I a combination of the two was a
| world-beater.
The Call-Bulletin acted like any
j business establishment. The News
acted like a gentleman. The News
; bowed to ethics. The Call to circu
lation. According to out-of-college
' standards, which did right?

Does journalism have an ethical I

journalism isn't a profession. It is a j
mixture of big business and crafts- :
manship. Big Business on the part •

the part of the staff. Have we a j
right to expect high ethical conduct |
from such a combination?

not sell papers. Papers must be sold. :

culation by thousands.
