THE STORY OF SAN MICHELE—!
By Axel Munthe. E. P. Button
Publishing Company. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
For two years now, "The Story of
San Michele" has been selling out,
| its supplies, until now it is in its
j 18th edition —and is still going
strong.
Written in the most whimsical
i style, with only the slightest at
tention paid to punctuation, this
I book is considered almost an epic
| by the literati of the world. "I be
j lieve in goblins, because once one
] sat on my desk," says Axel Munthe
! in the foreword —and by the end
j of the book the reader finds him
j self believing in anything from
; giants to Liliputians.
Axel Munthe's book has to do
i with his own life, beginning with
! his studies in Paris as a doctor
! under Pasteur, and ending with his
j colorful, yet peaceful life at the San
j Michele mission in Italy. His ad
! ventures are worthy of a Galahad,
I and of a Fairbanks—in their vivid
-1 ness and chivalry; his thoughts are
! gently philosophical and charming.
For sheer beauty, for whimsy, for*
| facts about' Europe and its life, for
I secrets of the Parisian medical
; world—"The Story of San Michele"
j is a gold mine. —E.S.H.

"Most women .... "is by way of

I women, love, and situations. As a
! cutalogue it is adequate and as a
I novel it is almost adequate. There
! are m.iny situations—ranging from

(
' the South Sea islands to New York !
City—set with varied types of j
women, some of which are excel- j
i lently managed, both in a literary i
and in a literal sense.
• The original conception for the i
' book is thoroughly interesting, of .
j course. It is unfortunate, only, that j
1 Mr. Waugh didn't see fit to leave j
ofT before his index approximated a ;
i tourist's guide book. In the interest i
| of scientific classification, we fear, j
j the author forgot art and repeated !
[ himself. A nice distinction is drawn I
| between the sullen women of Mar- j
j tinique and the passionate, joyous j
j ones of Tahiti but the descriptions '
