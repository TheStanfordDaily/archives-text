# The 						WINDJAMMER

### 
Windjammer may be a pretty spry
young Jellow most of the time, but
he's also a respecter ef the revered
past, the dim and distant history
of-no-g: eat-importance that nobody
but a postmaster ever remembers.
But even we were almost stumped,
yesterday, at a letter that arrived
addressed to us in a very boyish
hand, and asking for advice. 1 hen
we searched through the files of his
toric Cabbages, and found that just
about a year ago that columnist
started answering requests for ad
vice, and publicly sympathizing
with love-laden youths—so maybe
the unknown author of this*note has
just gotten a last-year's calendni
by mistake, or something.
The letter reads, in part:
"Dear Windjammer: S read
your column with a great deal
of pleasure, and greatly admire
your ability to give heartening
advice to those in need of it.
Maybe you will take pit> on
me?
I am a senior student, member of
a good fraternity, at least it had a
good reputation back home, al
though I've never heard anyone but
a brother mention it out here. 1
am tall, very good-looking, and a
member of every important com
mittee in school, except Men's
Council, Ex Committee, Publica
tions Council, the 8.A.C., and the
Senior Class Committee, and a few
others that I forget now.
I am a very experienced athlete,
too, having played on our intra
mural basketball team in 1!)28. 1
have never flunked more than three
courses in one quarter.
Now 1 am desperately in love
with a very lovely Stanford girl,
who is popular and brilliant.
She is also very, very beautiful,
hut that makes no difference to
me. It is her intelligence that I
admire and adore her for.
I have a great deal of money, hav
ing inherited a second-hand car
business in Palo Alto, so I would

| of the New York women, the San
Francisco, and the New Orleans
i women are much too similar.
Lyncl Ward surpasses himself, if
i possible, in the numerous woodcuts.
E. T. P.

| like to marry her and settle down
i quietly somewhere. The trouble is,
she is engaged to another promi
nent student, who is supposed to be
; a friend of mine, and since she says
I she loves him and would do any
' thing for him, I think there must
be some understanding between
i them. If I were not such a person
! age and she were not so prominent,
I would fight for her.
What would you suggest, fans,
in a rase like that? Temporarily,
A., I advise: (*et rid of that
i dreadful inferiority • complex.
Visit a dentist and have X-rays
made. Your wisdom teeth may
he bad. As a last resort, move
in with the Dekes, and you'll
get over it.
