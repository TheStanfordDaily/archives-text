# Campus Opinion
## NO APOLOGY NECESSARY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I fear that I owe an apology to
the Stanford Daily and to the Um
i versity at large for having written
j a letter that gave the San Francisco
J Call-Bulletin another opportunity
j for grossly misrepresenting campus
I news in a sensational manner. Cer
j Uiinly this was not my intention.
I wish to add that I make no
| statement to the press hut to deny
i any more knowledge of the affair
i than was written in my letter to the j
| Daily; and that all statements : s
cribed to me by the Call-Bulletin i
I (aside from direct quotations of the !
! letter) are quite false. The "pariah"' i
j matter and the desire imputed to 1
I me to punish those of whom 1 dis- j
I approved are sheerest folly.

I cannot feel that, my communi
cation was unjust; but I deeply re
gret having unwittingly 1 n-nished
t> the press some foundation f>r a
stoij hat must be painful to .11
Stanfoiu tudents and, more par
ticularly to myself.
