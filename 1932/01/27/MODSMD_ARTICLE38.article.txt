# Frosh Lose Practice Game To Phelps-Terkel Outfit
## TEAM WEAKENED BY SUBSTITUTION IN HOOP CONTEST Two San Francisco Basket Bail Squads To Meet Frosh Saturday 
### 
The Stanford frosh, weakened by
continual string of substitutions,
lost a 114-27 practice game to the
Phelps-Terkel outfit of Palo Alto
yesterday afternoon. The starting
quintet for the Indians, composed
of Wally Crowe, center, Frank Cox
and Lory Rothert, forwards, and
Joe Butte and Jim Savage, guards,
easily outscored the Palo Altans,
with several former Stanford stars,
who made most of their points
against Fawcett's third-string live.
Yesterday's game followed in the
footsteps of one of the hardest scrim
mages of the year on Monday after
noon. 'Another tough workout will
probably be the yearlings' fare this
afternoon, and as a result the
Papooses should present an even
more smooth-working quintet Fri
day and Saturday against the U.S.F.
1 rosh and Lowell High, than in their
fine showing against the California
Bear Cubs.
Fawcett's charges are confident of
their ability to beat their taller ri
vals from across the bay, and will
get their next chance when the two
te.ams meet February 13, at Berke
ley, preliminary to the second in
stallment of the Big Game series.
Tom Kelly and Gordon Mallatratt
were absent from practice last night,
but they are expected to play a big
part in this week-end's tussles. Al
though Kelly failed to outshine
Crowe at center Saturday, Malla
tratt's work was very pleasing. Tall
opponents are poison for Mallatratt,
because of his short stature, but the
former Galileo guard will have a
chance to practice against his pet
aversions on Saturday night, when
lie tries to bottle up such giants as
Ritchie Hay, and his equally tall
teammates. Against Palo Alto High,
the Lowellites played an exception
ally brilliant defensive game, and
held their peninsula rivals to one
basket, and in another game com
pletely stopped the much-vaunted
offense of the California freshmen.
