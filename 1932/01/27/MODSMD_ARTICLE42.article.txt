# ELLINGTON SEARCHES FOR PROSPECTS AS FROSH TRACK SEASON PROGRESSES
## 
### 
Basing their zeal on the supposi- '
tion that practice will make per
fect, freshman track candidates are :
working out daily under Coach Bill
Ellington while awaiting news of j
their first meet. Although no fresh- i
man track schedule has been an
nounced, there is at least a possi- j
bility that the season will open as
early as March 5.
At the present time, Coach Elling
ton is concentrating all his detec
tive powers pn a search for a broad
jumper. Lawrie Lapidus promised |
at the start of the season to star
in this event, but then was found
to be ineligible. Pop Flanagan, who
had broad-jumped many years ago ,
in high school, came out, but added
weight caused Ellington to shift him
to the shot-put-. Then John Beach
who jumped twenty feet, seven
inches for Alameda high school last j
year, hurt his knee in football and ;
may not be able to run track this i
spring. Which leaves the frosh not i
only without a good broad-jumper,
but without any broad-jumper.
Quantitatively speaking, the shot- j
put is the strongest of the events, I
as no less than six would-be Roth
erts are toiling daily in the seven i
foot circle. This list includes: Josiin, |
Flanagan, Lettunich, Steiner, Hager,
and Keller, among whom only Jos
iin has had much experience.
A Palo Alto high school product,
Warren Lemmon by name, should
lend strength to the 880, as he has
a high school mark of 2:04.
If Johnnie Mottram improves as
much ar> he should and Lemmon

J equals or surpasses his high school
! record, Ellington's ' worries about
finding adequate middle distance
' runners will be ended. Mottram is
I a javelin thrower by inclination, but
i when he hurt his shoulder in fresh
man football, decided that he always
: had wanted to run the 440. Yes
' terday he went a step, in fact many
j steps, further and ran an 880 with
i George Naylon and Charles de√üret
teville.
A1 Blackman still looks to be the
best freshman sprinter seen here in
: some time. Yesterday, Blackman
reeled off a speedy 220 in 22:4, which
was good enough to beat Jimmie
I Willson of the varsity.
The highly touted Phil Morentin,
; who so far has more than lived up
to the record he brought to Stan
| ford, has been suffering from shin
! splints, as has Underbill, a half
miler. However, Dave Devlin, who
i with Morentin is expected to star in
! both distance runs, is in good health,
i and proved it yesterday when he
ran a mile with Art Azevedo.
i Being class conscious ;jnd patri
i otically inclined, the members of
| '35's track team have thus far re-
I fused to emulate the example of
| Dave Packard and Gus Meier of
last year's frosh, at least so far as
! running hurdles is concerned. It
j will be remembered that both Meier
I and Packard broke sixteen flat in
I the highs last season, while no six
; teen or better timber-toppers have
appeared among this year's crop of
tracksters to gladden Ellington's
i heart.
