# COMING SEASON'S BOXING PROSPECT PLEASES MALONEY
## Outstanding Men Turn Out For Each Weight; 25 Fighters At Work 
### 
!
Stanford boxing season, like pros- i
perity, is just around the corner j
and, like prosperity, it looks par- j
ticularly bright.
Twenty-five men are on the var- j
sity roster with at least one out
standing fighter in each weight.
Coach Harry Maloney is pleased
with the showing of his boxers in
practice and is expecting to get a
further line on his team as a result
of the al!-University tournament of
February 4.
To date a seven-man team would !
probably read as follows:
Heavyweight—Phil Smith or Ben j
Palamountain
Light-heavyweight — "Slip" Gil- j
bert
Middleweight—Fred Johnson
Welterweight—Jim Kelley
Lightweight—W. M. Rowland 01*
Ben Mathews
Featherweight—Mark Kai-Kee
Bantamweight—Yuji Imai
The heavyweight match should
| prove to be the feature of the tour
j nament with Palamountain and
1 Smith fighting it out for first place ,
I on the squad. In a practice bout j
j last night they looked to be fairly
! evenly matched. Smith has a shade j
j as far as condition is concerned and
i is more experienced, but Palamoun
! tain is improving rapidly.
1 Rowland at present is fighting as
| a featherweight but Maloney plans
; to change him to the lightweight
division where he will find an able
j contender in Ben Mathews. Both
i men are new to the Stanford ring.
Other practice bouts give prom
, ise of some real fights in the re
j remaining weight departments.
