LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26. (/P) â€”
Governor James Rolph, Jr., after a
three-and-one-half-hour meeting
with the State Athletic Commission,
indicated today that the breach be
tween Robert Edgren and his two
fellow members, Dr. Harry Martin
and Rev. Leslie Kelly, has been
healed, and said the commission will
'"proceed with the unity of purpose
for which it was appointed."
Governor Rolph said that Edgren,
sports writer of Pacific Grove, had
decided to continue as a member of
the commission and withdrawn his
offer of resignation, submitted to
the Governor some days ago be
cause of internal friction.
