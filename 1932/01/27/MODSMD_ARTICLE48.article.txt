Stanford's baseball nine opened'
its season Jast Saturday with a vie- j
tory over the Olympic Club and ex*-
L'cpt for a few weak spots in the
infield looked like another cham
pionship outfit. Coach Harry Wol
ters has a host of veterans and
plenty of good sophomore material
with which he is building a nine
that is destined to become the team
to beat among California's college
teams.
With about a half dozen hurlers
including Ernie Caddel, Bob Estes,
and three or four capable catchers,
whatever difficulties Wolters may
have had in the battery department
are already solved. And with Rin
tala, Campbell, and Goldman, the
outfield situation is excellent. Gold
man is the only new man in the lot
replacing last year's captain, Johnny
Hunken, at left field. Goldman
proved himself worthy last week
when he led the Indian sluggers,
collecting three bingles out of four
times ai ihe plate which accounted
for two of the runs made by the
Card nine.
The only serious problem facing
the coach is that of the infield posts.
Bert Delmas at shortstop and Vince
Philippi at second base are the only
veterans, but the first and third

sacks are weak. So far Art Hearn
leads a half-dozen candidates for |
the first base position left vacant |
by Spud Hardy and Jerry Traut
man has been getting the call at
third.
Football fans who were in Kezar
Stadium last Sunday were given the
rare opportunity of seeing Ernie ;
Nevers at his best and probably for j
the last time. The blond giant has
decided that the game is about j
enough, declaring that he will quit
while "in one piece" and continue
his football career in the role of ;
coach.
What fortunate institution will.
eventually land the nation's "great- !
est football star" is yet unknown, i
but no one would be very much |
surprised if he came back to the |
Farm. Ernie has been rumored as i
an assistant to Warner for several
weeks and new that he is actually i
after a position, it will be only a
matter of weeks before such a thing
could become a reality.
Warner himself favors the idea
but the only obstacle is that such a |
move would necessitate an addition
to the coaching staff which under
present circumstances can hardly
be expected.
