I) OB FISHER'S Id digits run up in El Toro's 20-1 conquest of the Phi
Sigs last night arc all that placed the outfit out in front with two
wins to its credit and the League II leadership thus far. The game was
fairly rapid in action, and although showed quite an improvement for
both squads over their Round I exhibition, still literally clamors for

practice on the part of the mural
quintets.
Verne Brown, with some out-
standing floorwork, helped out in
most of the action and Russ Byrd
was able to account for the addi-
tional four points of the Club. Les
McElwain was responsible for 3 of
the Row-men's 4 tallies. Bob War-
dell showed lots of fire and pep in
the game.
Baxter High Scorer
The Fijis, after showing lots of
promise in their first game, went
down 16-11 before a slow Alpha
Sig attack, in spite of the fact that
Jack Hoerner, their Nebraska all-
state center, shot four baskets and
a free shot in the first period. Bob
Baxter took 10 of the 16 Alpha Sig
total and played a steady game at
forward. Assisting with 6 digits,
Ernie Stump helped out in the scor-
ing drive. The game was ragged
and it appeared that the Fijis, with
more practice, should still be able
to do some damage to their remain-
ing opponents.
Taking a slightly faster contest,
but, not showing any real potential
strength, the D.U. outfit won the
Zeta Psi contest 13-5 last night.
Howie Folsom and Thornwell
Rogers of the opposing outfits re
spectively accounted for 8 and 6
points in the clash.
Arcos in Second Place
Los Arcos' 19-6 defeat of the
A.T.O. five places that quintet in
second place for League III honors
and points toward future conquests.
Jack Valentine, lithe forward, shot
4 baskets and was assisted in action
mainly by Stan Madden and Don
Hardy, guard and center on the
Arcos squad.
Ernie Arbuckle and Jim Kelley
featured the principal A.T.O. attack,
producing results, but not enough
to do any real good. Gene Mires,
intramural manager, and "Pop"
Gabriel refereed last night's events.
The Encina 2W-Independents clash
for tonight has been switched from
the Gym to the Pavilion. The
A.K.L.-Theta Xi contest has been
postponed to February 2 at 8 o'clock
in the Gym.

dell showed lots of fire and pep in
the game.
Baxter High Scorer
The Fijis, after showing lots of
promise in their first game, went
down 16-11 before a slow Alpha
Sig attack, in spite of the fact that
Jack Hoerner, their Nebraska all-
state center, shot four baskets and
a free shot in the first period. Bob
Baxter took 10 of the 16 Alpha Sig
total and played a steady game at
forward. Assisting with 6 digits,
Ernie Stump helped out in the scor-
ing drive. The game was ragged
and it appeared that the Fijis, with
more practice, should still be able
to do some damage to their remain-
ing opponents.
Taking a slightly faster contest,
but, not showing any real potential
strength, the D.U. outfit won the
Zeta Psi contest 13-5 last night.
Howie Folsom and Thornwell
Rogers of the opposing outfits re
spectively accounted for 8 and 6
points in the clash.
Arcos in Second Place
Los Arcos' 19-6 defeat of the
A.T.O. five places that quintet in
second place for League III honors
and points toward future conquests.
Jack Valentine, lithe forward, shot
4 baskets and was assisted in action
mainly by Stan Madden and Don
Hardy, guard and center on the
Arcos squad.
Ernie Arbuckle and Jim Kelley
featured the principal A.T.O. attack,
producing results, but not enough
to do any real good. Gene Mires,
intramural manager, and "Pop"
Gabriel refereed last night's events.
The Encina 2W-Independents clash
for tonight has been switched from
the Gym to the Pavilion. The
A.K.L.-Theta Xi contest has been
postponed to February 2 at 8 o'clock
in the Gym.

I) OB FISHER'S Id digits run up in El Toro's 20-1 conquest of the Phi
Sigs last night arc all that placed the outfit out in front with two
wins to its credit and the League II leadership thus far. The game was
fairly rapid in action, and although showed quite an improvement for
both squads over their Round I exhibition, still literally clamors for

practice on the part of the mural
quintets.
Verne Brown, with some out-
standing floorwork, helped out in
most of the action and Russ Byrd
was able to account for the addi-
tional four points of the Club. Les
McElwain was responsible for 3 of
the Row-men's 4 tallies. Bob War-
dell showed lots of fire and pep in
the game.
