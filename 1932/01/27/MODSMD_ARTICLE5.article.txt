I) OB FISHER'S Id digits run up in El Toro's 20-1 conquest of the Phi
Sigs last night arc all that placed the outfit out in front with two
wins to its credit and the League II leadership thus far. The game was
fairly rapid in action, and although showed quite an improvement for
both squads over their Round I exhibition, still literally clamors for

practice on the part of the mural
! quintets.
I Verne Brown, with some out- j
! standing floorwork, helped out in
! most of the action and Russ Byrd
! was able to account for the addi- j
j lional four points of the Club. Les
McElwain was responsible for 3 of i
I the Row-men's 4 tallies. Bob War- i
dell showed lots of fire and pep in j
the game.
Baxter High Scorer
The Fi j is, after showing lots of j
promise in their first .game, went j
down 16-11 before a slow Alpha j
Sig attack, in spite of the fact that !
Jack Hoerner, their Nebraska all- !
state center, shot four baskets and,
a free shot in the first period. Bob i
Baxter took 10 of the 1(> Alpha Sig !
total and played a steady game at
forward. Assisting with G digits, j
Ernie Stump helped out in the scor- i
ing drive. The game was ragged!
and it appeared that the Fijis, with |
more practice, should still be able |
to do some damage to their remain- j
j ing opponents.
Taking a slightly faster contest, ,
! but, not showing any real potential j
: strength, the D.U. outfit won the I
J Zeta Psi contest 13-5 last night. I
Howie Folsom and Thornwell i
Rogers of the opposing outfits re
spectively accounted for 8 and (>
points in the clash.

The Fi j is, after showing lots of j
promise in their first .game, went j
down 16-11 before a slow Alpha j
Sig attack, in spite of the fact that !
Jack Hoerner, their Nebraska all- !
state center, shot four baskets and,
a free shot in the first period. Bob i
Baxter took 10 of the 1(> Alpha Sig !
total and played a steady game at
forward. Assisting with G digits, j
Ernie Stump helped out in the scor- i

more practice, should still be able |
to do some damage to their remain- j
j ing opponents.

I) OB FISHER'S Id digits run up in El Toro's 20-1 conquest of the Phi
Sigs last night arc all that placed the outfit out in front with two
wins to its credit and the League II leadership thus far. The game was
fairly rapid in action, and although showed quite an improvement for
both squads over their Round I exhibition, still literally clamors for

practice on the part of the mural
! quintets.
I Verne Brown, with some out- j
! standing floorwork, helped out in
! most of the action and Russ Byrd
! was able to account for the addi- j
j lional four points of the Club. Les
McElwain was responsible for 3 of i
I the Row-men's 4 tallies. Bob War- i
dell showed lots of fire and pep in j
the game.
