# POLOISTS MEET ARIZONA RIDERS
## 
### 
Chances of skinning the Arizona
Wildcat when the Card poloists
clash with this outfit February 20-
22 look better every day, believes
Captain Richard A. Gordan, coach
of the Rcdshirt riders.
Last Monday's varsity practice
was the best so far this year. The
first string, composed of Spalding,
Gillham, Lewis, and Fleming, com
pletely rode over the second team.
It was the first time of the* season
that the players have been able to
find their scoring eye, and at the
same time show any semblance of
first-class teamwork.
The game with the Wildcats will
be played at Arizona. Five men will
make the trip: Spalding, Gillham,
Lewis, Fleming, and Malone.
Because of high entrance require
ments, only 435 freshmen were ad
mitted to the University of Hawaii
out of 700 applicants.
