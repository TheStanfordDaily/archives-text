# LAD TORTURED BY FIVE RUM RUNNERS

### 
McHENRY, 111., Jan. 26. (/P)
Nineteen-year-old Alvin Bauer, son
of a McHenry ice dealer, was kid
napped by five beer runners last
night and tortured over a bonfire
while his abductors demanded to
know where the local speakeasies
bought their bootleg liquor.
Taken down from his perch
above the fire to be given a last
chance to talk, the lad broke from
captors and escaped in the
darkness.
