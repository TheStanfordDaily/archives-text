# CRIPPLED HOOP TEAM OFF FOR SOUTH TONIGHT
## Edelen Definitely Out Of U.C.L.A. Series With Injured Toe CORDRY MAY BE OKEH Bruin Cagers Hit Stride In Game With U.S.C 
### Dick Rodda 
One ol the least of John Bunp s
worries this week is to select a
team to make the trip to Los An
geles, for the process of the sur
vival of the fittest has already re
duced the squad sufficiently so that
there will be no one left to elimi
nate. The cripples will remain at
home and the rest of the outfit will
board the Lark tonight to open the
second two-game series with
U.C.L.A. Friday night at Los An
geles.
Just who will go, however, will
not be announced by the coach un
til this afternoon.
The only new development in the
Indian hospital ward yesterday was
that Edelen is definitely out of the
Bruin contests still suffering from
an injured toe
"Tiny Tom" Cordry, who has been
out for the last couple of practices,
looked good last night scrimmaging
with the first five. Cordry's injured
leg was heavily taped but it didn't
seem to bother him at all. Despite
his performance last night in the
best of form it is still undecided
whether he will be able to start
against the Bruins.
Considering that -the Card cripple
list is as large as it was last week
and that U.C.L.A. has come out
from behind to whip the league
leading Trojans, and that the games
will be played in Southern Cali
fornia, the Bruins might be con
ceded an edge in this week-end's
encounters. Granting that the In
dians have already conquered them
Iwice, it must also be remembered
that it was a pretty tough job and
one of the games was won after
overcoming a U.C.L.A. lead in the
last few minutes of play.
The Bruins seem to be finding
their stride just as the California
Bears have, which means that they
will be tough playmates for the In
dians.
Bunn started Cosgrove, LaCombe,
Doub, Hancock, and Norgard against
Meade, Glasgow, Jenkins, Baker,
and Tod in last night's scrimmage.
The former five, of course, is the
first string that will probably open
in the South. Packard alternated
with Doub and Cordry with Cos
grove in this lineup.
The boys will return to the cam
pus Monday morning on the Sunset
Limited, which gives them only
four days to get ready to make the
same trip the following week-end
for a couple of games with the
U.S.C. Trojans.
