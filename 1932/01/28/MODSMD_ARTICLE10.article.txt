# RESCUE FLEET STRUGGLES TO FREE LOST SUB
## Sixty Men Trapped On Sea Floor As Divers Risk Lives In Search 
### 
PORTLAND, England, Jan. 27 </P).
—Divers working in darkness and
swirling tides made desperate ef
forts tonight to reach two objects
lying on the floor of Dead Man's
bay in the hope that one or the
other might be the British sub
marine M-2.
Meanwhile H. M. S. Tcdworth,
which is equipped with special de
compression chambers and the latest
appliances for deep sea diving, was
suddenly ordered to proceed from
Devonport to Portland late tonight.
Extra Divers Heady
A number of extra divers had
been drafted for the Tedworth be
fore midnight and she left for Port
land.
The cables of mine sweepers
searching for the missing submarine
with its sixty men—or their bodies
—inside, located the two objects, the
Admiralty reported.
Divers risked their lives in re
peated descents, but thus far had
been unable to reach bottom. Div
ing was to be continued throughout
the night.
Oil, Bubbles Lacking
Despite the intensive search,
scarcely with a parallel in British
naval history,, no trace had been
found on the surface water of oil,
bubbles or anything that normally
indicates a submarine is lying in
the 1 depths below.
The rescue flotilla was concen
trated to the west of Portland Bill,
famous headland, around which
sweep some of the most treacherous
tides and currents in the seven seas.
The flotilla was commanded by Ad
miral C. J. C. Little, the Admiral in
charge of British submarines.
Sister Ship Searches
The M-2's sister ship cruised here
and there under the water sounding
the clucking device with which sub
marines communicate with each
other when submerged, but there
never was the slightest sound which
might have been an attempt to an
swer.
Semiofficial quarters in London
were reported to have suggested
that orders which suddenly sent the
Tedworth here tonight meant that
the submarine had been found, but
there was no confirmation.
