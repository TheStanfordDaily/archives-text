### 
One of those things that happen
once in a lifetime.
Or maybe once in a decade or so.
Monday night Encina Club held
an election to determine the mem
bers of the new Freshman Men's
Honor Council, and it came off
beautifully— except that one posi
tion out of the nine was tied for.
Charles Ducommun and John
Loomis received equal votes, so a
revote was called for last night.
The impossible happened. They
tied again, 112 to 112. One of the
largest votes to turn out for a fresh
man election of any kind had again
given them equal honors.
Another revote will be held to
night in tho Encina lobby, begin
ning at 7:30 o'clock.
