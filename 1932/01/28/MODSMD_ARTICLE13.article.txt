## 
### 
By Harrison Foss
Good seats for "Bird In Hand" arc
still obtainable at the A.S.S.U. office
m the Old Union, and at Keeble's
jn PaK) Alto, but they are being
lapidly sold. The price range is
from $1.25 to 75 cents. For conven
ience, from 9 to 12 o'clock today
will be sold in front of the
Women's Clubhouse. The curtain
will rise at 8:30 o'clock tomorrow
evening.
Most prominent in the cast is
James Lyons, who scored a personal
triumph in the leading role of
"Wings Over Europe" when it was
produced here last year. Besides the
regular performance, this play re
ceived a request showing on the
campus, and the cast was invited to
perform at the Bohemian Club in
San Francisco.
Lyons Plays Lead
In John Drinkwater's comedy,
"Bird In Hand," Lyons has a part
that is very different from that of
Francis Lightfoot in "Wings Over
Europe." Tomorrow evening he will
play Cyril Beverly, the son of a
rich man who by chance plays a
unique role in the lives of the peo
ple who own the old "Bird In Hand"
Inn. The part of Cyril Beverly pre
sents Lyons with a fine opportunity
for another personal success.
As well known as Lyons is James
Sandoe. Sandoe has been active for
quite some time in dramatics here,
and at the Palo Alto Community
Theatre. His last important role on
the campus stage was as Mr.
Throstle in "Berkeley Square," pro
duced last quarter. His flair for
pantomime and his lucid use of ac
cent bids fair to steal a good share
of the applause in all scenes in
which he appears. In the present
pioduction he will be seen as the
cockney sardine salesman, Mr.
Blanquctâ€”"of French descent."
Characters Real
Production of "Bird In Hand" is
a distinct accomplishment for the
Dramatic Council. That the strug
gle between the old and the new is
an apt subject for charming comedy
is evidenced by the phenomenally
long run that "Bird In Hand" re
ceived both in London and on
Broadway. The characters arc all
real, Drinkwater probably gaining
his skill for doing such perfect por
traits from his work as the fore
most biographical dramatist of the
day, his plays, "Robert E. Lee," and
"Abraham Lincoln" being best
known in America.
Harold Helvenston, who is direct
ing, W3.> very pleased with the way
the first dress rehearsal went last
night. The second and last dress re
hearsal is scheduled for tonight.
Sets foi the production are being
designed and executed by Frederick
Stover. There will be two scenes.
The first and third act will take
place in the family living-room of
the "Bird In Hand" Inn and the
second act set will represent a bed
room upstairs in the same building.
