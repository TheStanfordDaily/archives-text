# Bird In Hand Not A Dodo Helvenston Guards Against Play Fakery Actors Models Of Virtue
## ROLPH MALLOCH 
### 
The familiar belief that all actors I
are very, very, wicked people was
shattered once and for all at last
night's pre-vue of the Dramatic
Council's latest effort, "Bird in |
Hand."
One of the principles, whose name
best goes unmentioned, arrived at
the rehearsal pale and wan and j
somewhat late. It seems that the
script calls for a bit of pipe-smoking !
in the first scene, and this lad, whose !
duty it was to perform the nefari- j
ous act, found it necessary to spend
the better part of the afternoon in
practicing inhaling, exhaling, light
ing, and the other mysteries. Hence
the woebegone appearance. The
meticulous Mr. Helvenston would |
permit no fakery in his show.
However, all the properties were |
not what they would seem. The I

coffee and tea are real, but the sar
dines are herring. A Rolls-Royce is
represented by a horn, four batter
ies, and a push-button. In former
rehearsals, a Gin bottle was used
in the wine-drinking scene, but in
last night's pre-vue a container for
consecrated altar wine replaced Mr.
Gordon's product.
In the bedroom scene, typical of
the relics surviving in this Tudor
house, arc two beautiful poles dc
chambrc. They are used for atmos
pheric background only, and do not
enter into the action of the play.
Already quite polished, there was
little in the action that the director
had to correct. The supposedly
English actors themselves hastily
changed the occasional lapse of an
"ask"' that slipped out in place of the
more stagey "ahsk."
