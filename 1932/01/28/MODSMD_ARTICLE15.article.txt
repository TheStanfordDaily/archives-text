# PRICE ASSERTS BUNN JUSTIFIED IN DELAY FIGHT
## Coaches Will Ask National Basketball Association To Change Rules 
### LOWELL COX 
Clarence M. "Nibs" Price, Uni- |
1 versity of California basketball ,
l coach, last night declared ho would '
support the campaign of John Bunn, '
1 Stanford coach, to secure legislation
against the stalling game.
Concurring with Bunn's belief that j
' the popularity of basketball is !
| threatened by this type of play, 1
which is used on the coast by the |
University of Southern California, I
; the Bear coach gave his hearty en- >.
I dorsement to Bunn's plan.
Definite Action Sought
The Indian mentor announced â– 
i Tuesday that he would demand the j
j recommendation of the National As- >
| sociation of Basketball Coaches that, j
pthe rules committee take action j
! against this system. The matter has !
j been brought before the association ;
before, but Bunn intends to battle :
for definite action this spring.
In the stalling or "guard control" j
| type of play, as practiced by U.S.C., '
i the offensive team refuses to take
| the aggressive as long as it is in the j
lead. This is done to draw out the |
! defense, giving the attacking team j
' a big advantage.
When the defense refuses to be j
drawn, the result is no action at all, :
games on the coast this year having
! been held up by the Trojans as long
as 16 minutes at a time.
Popularity Threatened
Both the Stanford and California j
coaches are agreed that this will j
' kill off the popularity of the game j
\ if allowed to continue.
"The way the rules arc now,"
Price told the Daily last night, I
"it gives an unfair advantage to
the offensive team when such
tactics arc employed, especially
if the officials do not watch the i
start of the dribble carefully.
"All the burden of breaking up a J
i stall should not be placed on the |
1 team behind in the score, as it is j
now. Responsibility should at least
be divided."
