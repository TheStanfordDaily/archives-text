SHANGHAI, China, Jan. 27. (/I*)—With British and American marines
erecting Imrhcd wire barricades for the defense of the international
settlement both the United States and Great Britain gave "serious con
| sideration" to the controversy at Shanghai. Japanese warships lay ready
for action before the city as the important port prepared the way today
for capitulation to Tokyo's ultimatum that anti-Japanese agitation be
stamped out. Manila reported ships of the United States Asiatic fleet were
preparing to sail for Shanghai. What the United States would do to re
i lieve the tense situation was not indicated, but some Washington officials
predicted moves of definite character.

v SHANGHAI, Jan. 27. (/?)—'The
*
j ultimate aim of Japan's policy to
| ward China is mastery of the Pacific
I ocean, Eugene Chen, who recently
j resigned as the Chinese Foreign
Minister, said tonight, and that
I means war with the United States.
: First, he said, Japan looks to \in-
I conditional annexation of Man
i churia, from which she can domi
nate the entire Asiatic mainland,
I and then to the conquest of Aus
! tralia.
Destined To Fight U.S.
j "To accomplish these things," said
■ he, "Japan knows she is destined to
j fight the United States. As a prep
| aration for this inevitable struggle,
j the occupation of Manchuria is an
j effort to obtain raw materials as
the sinews of war.
"Her present pressure against
j Shanghai ;.nd the Yangtze valley,
| which contemplates the occupation
not only of Shanghai but also of
[ Nanking, is sufficient to paralyze
I the Chinese government and to
i force its acceptance of Japan's for
! mal annexation of Manchuria."
These arc the first steps "beinu
I carried cut by the medieval minded
I military shogunate in the form of
! a general staff which is the real
! government of Japan."
"Men of this type planned the
| Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese
, wars," said Dr. Chen. "Now they
! see Japan dominating all Asia and
Australia.
i "Between her and this goal stands
the United States. Therefore she
j plans for war. While other nations
' disarm she arms. Manchuria is but
; a preparatory step for her greatest
| conflict in which she hopes to ban-
I ish forever the influence of Western
I nations in the Pacific ocean."
