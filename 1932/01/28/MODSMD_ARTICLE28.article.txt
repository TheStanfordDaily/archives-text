# PHI BETA KAPPA GOES INTO JOURNALISM
## 
### 
This month the national honor society, Phi Beta Kappa,
announces the appearance, of a new quarterly magazine,
The. American Scholar, designed not only for members of
the organization but for all who have general scholarly
interests.
Among its objectives are listed the following: "the pro
motion in America of liberal scholarship; a medium for
scholars and all persons who are interested in intellectual
pursuits, higher learning, and the cultural development of
America; a synthesis of the arts and sciences essential to
liberal education and guiding philosophy of life; and
esprit de corps among the educated; the scholar's responsi
bility for major social tendencies, and whole diet for the
s\ hole mind."
A large order, we will admit, and a worthy ambition.
And it is fitting that a body of people whose abilities for
accomplishment have become a by-word through Phi Beta
Kappa should sponsor the. project and be charged with the
'responsibilities of making it a success.
