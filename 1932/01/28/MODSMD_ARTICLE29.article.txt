# STRENGTHENING THE COLLEGE PRESS
## 
### 
In as much as recent surveys of the intercollegiate press
situation have shown not only that a major part of that
press is censored, but that it likewise seldom shows con
certed action, associations such as the National College
Press association are of particular importance at the pres
ent time. Through such associations, pressure can grad
ually be brought to bear upon the various administrations
which are censoring college newspapers with the ultimate
result that the college press in the United States will be
able to drive straight into existing evils in the world of
education without fear of cramping at the hands of a nar
row censorship. Also, with such censorship gradually be
ginning to disappear, concerted drives by several college
papers may be made to effect changes in existing features
of the educational system, or to create new situations or
systems.
The (Columbia Spectator, because it has been treated
with fairness and a true "hands-ofF 1 policy by the univer
sity administration has been able to criticise most, violently
where it lias believed that such criticism has been war
ranted .'>..(l it will continue to do so. In the recent much
publicized football controversy which was opened by Spec
tator, changes in existing football conditions were brought
about at Columbia whereas nothing could have been ac
complished under a censored system. The value of con
certed action was also illustrated during the same period
when the A 'an York 1' niversily Daily Sews, after consulting
with Spectator, launched a subsidiary campaign at that in
st i liil ion which brought about radical changes in football
administration there.
It is my opinion that the greatest value of associations
to bind together college newspapers is to present a strong
front against censorship ;tml against every feature of the
educational system which may seem in error to a majority
of the newspapers in such an association. Every college
newspaper which does not belong to an active association
in this field should bend every effort toward securing such
membership at the earliest opportunity. Columbia Spec
