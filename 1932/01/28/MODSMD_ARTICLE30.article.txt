# BULL SESSION
## SHOULD WOMEN VOTE? 
### 
Today, the eighteenth amendment
has become so popular—ol* so no
torious that most people forget that
; the Constitution also has several
i other amendments. One of these is
j tha nineteenth amendment which
j gives women the right lo vote,
j During the long and continued agi
tation for this right, it was held that
with the vote in the hands of the
better-half, politics would become
99 and 44/100 per cent pure. It was
! felt that we would then elect "The
Cream of the Crop." In fact, the
i golden era of democracy was to be
ushered in with the advent of
women's voting.
And what a disillusionment. In
| stead of improving politics, women
j have done little but udd another
j type of campaign bunk to the long
; list already tolerated by men. While
male reformers were trying to keep
the wolf of corruption from the
political door, sentimentality flew
in the window. Yet it did not fly
in, rather it just poured in—an ir
resistible mess of molasses, honey,
and homemade talfy. Did the women
try to clean up or dam the flow?
On the contrary, they jusL lap it
up and cry for more. Talk about
homes and firesides and children is
just custom made for women voters.
It is often maintained that women
have moved politics from the back
room of the saloon; but if so, they
I have placed it on the platform of
j women's clubs. Hard liquor may
I have flowed in those back rooms,
| but a more deadly stuff is handed
1 out in the average club. Soothing,
l sentimental slosh is sweetly dished
• out to the warm heart of the

mother-voter and does she respond
on election day?
All men were not saloon voters.
They couldn't be; for one thing
there probably weren't enough sa
loons. There is hardly a woman
alive, however, who is not soothed
by home-heart-and-hearth palaver
or who is not stirred to righteous
indignation by the mention of a few
stock phrases like the "underworld,"
"while slavers," etc.
The type of candidate that ap
pealed to a strictly male vote can
not always click today. This does
riot mean a change for the better;
it simply means a change. Lincoln—
clumsy, poorly dressed, speaking in
his backwoods manner • — would
probably have been defeated if pet
ticoats had gone to polls. Jackson,
without a doubt, would have been
defeated. He loved to drink and he
loved to swear; and he did the
things he enjoyed. The qualities
which endeared men to him would
have lost him countless votes.
Cleveland, who was forced to ad
mit. a boyhood indiscretion in the
campaign, would have received fair
ly sure defeat from women.
Some say that A1 Smith might
h;.ve been elected without the
woman's vote. That might be a good
reason for women's voting. At least
R is recognized as a good thing for
the Democratic Party because this
depression would have forced them
off the political scene forever. Gen
erally, there is no logical justifica
tion for women's voting. It is
claimed that women should vote
because men vote. That is no justi
fication. It is simply an excuse.
