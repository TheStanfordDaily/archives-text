I SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS — By 1
Dorothy L. Sayers. Brewer, War
ren and Putnam. New York, 1931. !
$2. (At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
An exceptionally good detective
I stoi-y, of the puzzle variety rather
1 than the bloody thriller.
I Dorothy Sayers' v/ork is always i
| a delight to the reader who likes t« (
| work out the problem himself, with
all the clues- laid on the table. This
, story has good characterization, ex- j
j cedent writing, and a very ingen- j
ious plot which manages to keep j
the reader in suspense as to the i
I identity of the murderer.
The book quite bears out our un- ;
I patriotic feeling that English de- ,
tcctive stories are much better than j
! American. —F.J. j
WAY BACK HOME—(With. Seth
i Parker). At the Varsity Theatre. ;
Truly rural and quite quite rural, i
j truly, and as such, very good. This j
! old-fashioned, country love story I
! is carried out with minute attention
I to sets, characters, and even to com
munity singing. Certainly this is the
* most completely countrified movie
j we have ever seen and we rather
I enjoyed it as being something to-
I tally different.
Besidns the naivete combined with .

worldly nonchalance which marks j
Seth Parker's acting and makes his j
intepretation of the benevolent I
farmer excellent there is convincing i
work by all the other "Jonesville I
folks," as the cast is designated, j
Perhaps the best proof we can give
of the success of the atmosphere is |
to say that Farmer Parker doesn't i
look as 'o he'd iver seen no radio.
.. . |
MANHATTAN PARADE —At (he
New Stanford Theatre.
To the neglected rough who has ;
been deprived of the glory of hav- j
ing one or two roommates, this pic- |
ture will furnish all the wrangling;
he has thereby missed. Smith and ;
Dale get off some pretty good gags !
but after hearing them quarrel for j
a certain length of time, you begin j
to wonder if there isn't some way !
they could get along.
Winnie Lightner lias one hectic j
time trying to make her costume j
factory a success, what with her j
husband running off with a blonde,i
and then the depression to boot! j
However, the show is done in tech
nicolor and the artistic effects, the :
modernistic furniture, and the ex- ;
otic costumes are not to be sneezed j
at.
See it if you must —and if you i
like brainstorms. —E.E.H.

MANHATTAN PARADE —At (he
New Stanford Theatre.
To the neglected rough who has ;
been deprived of the glory of hav- j
ing one or two roommates, this pic- |
ture will furnish all the wrangling;
he has thereby missed. Smith and ;
Dale get off some pretty good gags !
but after hearing them quarrel for j
a certain length of time, you begin j
to wonder if there isn't some way !
they could get along.
Winnie Lightner lias one hectic j
time trying to make her costume j
factory a success, what with her j
husband running off with a blonde,i
and then the depression to boot! j
However, the show is done in tech
nicolor and the artistic effects, the :
modernistic furniture, and the ex- ;
otic costumes are not to be sneezed j
at.
See it if you must —and if you i
like brainstorms. —E.E.H.

Dorothy L. Sayers. Brewer, War
ren and Putnam. New York, 1931. !
$2. (At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
An exceptionally good detective
I stoi-y, of the puzzle variety rather
1 than the bloody thriller.
I Dorothy Sayers' v/ork is always i
| a delight to the reader who likes t« (
| work out the problem himself, with
all the clues- laid on the table. This
, story has good characterization, ex- j
j cedent writing, and a very ingen- j
ious plot which manages to keep j
the reader in suspense as to the i
I identity of the murderer.
The book quite bears out our un- ;
I patriotic feeling that English de- ,
tcctive stories are much better than j
! American. —F.J. j
WAY BACK HOME—(With. Seth
i Parker). At the Varsity Theatre. ;
Truly rural and quite quite rural, i
j truly, and as such, very good. This j
! old-fashioned, country love story I
! is carried out with minute attention
I to sets, characters, and even to com
munity singing. Certainly this is the
* most completely countrified movie
j we have ever seen and we rather
I enjoyed it as being something to-
I tally different.
Besidns the naivete combined with .

worldly nonchalance which marks j
Seth Parker's acting and makes his j
intepretation of the benevolent I
farmer excellent there is convincing i
work by all the other "Jonesville I
folks," as the cast is designated, j
Perhaps the best proof we can give
of the success of the atmosphere is |
to say that Farmer Parker doesn't i
look as 'o he'd iver seen no radio.
