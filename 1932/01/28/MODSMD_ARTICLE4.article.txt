# DEBATERS TOUR PACIFIC COAST
## Mellinkoff, Conn Chosen To Represent Cards 
### 
Debating four Pacific Coast col
leges, Abe Mellinkoff and Howard
Conn, Stanford varsity debaters,
I will leave on Feburary 21st, for a
week's oratorical barnstorming tour
of the Pacific Northwest.
The extensive tour of the Stanford
! men was arranged largely through
' the interest in forensic activity of
1 the Northwest Nazarene College of
Nampa, Idaho. Last year the Na- I
| zarane College sent a team to Stan
i ford for a debate. As a result of
j this argumentative duel, the Idaho
| institution offered to pay the ex
penses of a Stanford team sent to
! debate them this year.
Although one of the smaller col- I
; leges on the coast, the Northwest |
Nazarene College has evidenced !
( such skill in debating that it is rec
j ognized for this activity throughout
I the Northwest. The Stanford debat
! ers expect a close contest from
i Northwest Nazarene College.
Lee Rodda, debate manager of
| the Northern institution in a com
i munication to John Gange, Stan
ford debate manager, announced the
i possibility that the Governor of â€¢
Idaho, the Superintendent of Edu- !
J cation, and a prominent civic of- ;
ficial would act as judges of the ;
! contest.
Abe Mellinkoff, Stanford repre- |
sentative, was one of the debaters |
1 who met the University of Califor- i
nia last quarter.
Howard Conn was a member of j
j the Stanford team which debated I
; a Turkish team from Roberts Col- '
lege. He also participated in the :
debate with Harvard University !
j over a nation-wide network.
