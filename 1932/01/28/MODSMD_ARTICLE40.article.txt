# LANGUAGE LEARNING SUBJECT FOR TALK OF NOTED EDUCATOR
## 
### 
Fusing the linguistic symbol to
; the thing symbolized is the l'unda
j mental principle of language learn-
I ing, in the opinion of Dr. Harold E.
| Palmer, distinguished educator, who
spoke in the Little Theatre yester
j day afternoon on "A New Technique
j of Language Study."
Dr. Palmer said that the peculiar
j difficulty of teaching foreign Jan
| guages is that there is a confusing
j mass of guiding principles. How
| ever, the speaker said, in all the
different ways of teaching languages
I there is one thing in common. "The
j process of learning any language
| consists in fusing the linguistic
I symbol to the thing symbolized."
Some words have as many as 250
j varieties of meanings, pointed out
| Dr. Palmer. To further complicate
j the situation, a language consists
j of not only words, but also phrases
which mean something other than
the mere definitions of the words
the phrase contains. The Japanese
language is composed entirely of
I these phrases.
