WHAT MAY prove to be the de
(iding factor in this scrap for
Southern Division basketball hon- |
l is is (he California-U.S.C. return !
.-eries at the Oakland Auditorium i
tomorrow and Saturday nights. With 1
the Indians journeying south to
tangle with U.C-L.A., many Farm I
lans are expected to make the trek
to Oakland.
Nibs Price's team has shown
steady improvement since drop
pins; these lirst two contests to
the Trojans at the opening of
tin' season, and as we said ear
lier in the week, the Bears have
a great chance to take the lead
away from "Silent Sain"' Barry
;tiu! his stalling proteges.
At the present time, the Califor- !
nians are just a game behind the
impudent Southerners, and by tak- j
ing both contests this week-end, |
would emerge a full game ahead.
It is still mathematically possible 1
for Stanford to come out on top, j
but considering the string of in- j
juries Li at have hit the Indian squad |
and thj strength of all three of the '
other division members, it is hardly
probable.
COACH JOHN BUNN was chuck- 1

"How come?" we queried.
"Oh," replied the chief of Stan
lord basketball affairs, "I was just
thinking how Sam Barry played
rifjht into U.C.L.A.'s hands the
other night, when he dropped that

Hi minutes, it looks to me like it
was just what Works wanted.
The Bruins have played the
best 24 minutes in all their
games lids .year, but with their
opponents winning in the last
few minutes.
"Wiih If! minutes cut off the play
ing time, U.C.L.A. came back fast
in the second half to win. It looks
like Barry pulled a boner."
THOSE WHO go to Oakland
for the games this week-end are
advised to arrive early, as there
will be no reserved seats and
early comers will get the choice
spots.

WHAT MAY prove to be the de
(iding factor in this scrap for
Southern Division basketball hon- |
l is is (he California-U.S.C. return !

tomorrow and Saturday nights. With 1
the Indians journeying south to

Nibs Price's team has shown
steady improvement since drop
pins; these lirst two contests to
the Trojans at the opening of
tin' season, and as we said ear
lier in the week, the Bears have
a great chance to take the lead
away from "Silent Sain"' Barry
;tiu! his stalling proteges.
At the present time, the Califor- !
nians are just a game behind the
impudent Southerners, and by tak- j

opponents winning in the last
few minutes.
"Wiih If! minutes cut off the play

in the second half to win. It looks
like Barry pulled a boner."
