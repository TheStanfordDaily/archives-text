# Threaten Records In Class Swim Finals Today
## SENIORS FAVORED TO DEFEAT SOPHS FOR TANK HONORS Individual Duels Feature Meet; Clapp, Wiget To Settle Feud 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
Probably featured by many a
! new pool record, the interclass j
swimming finals will be held this
; afternoon at 4 o'clock sharp, with \
ladies invited and admission free.
' Eight events plus a diving exhibi
j tion will make up the program.
I Of main interest are the Clapp-
Wiget fight for 220-yard and 440-
yard honors, and the Gardner-Mc-
Kelvey duel in the 50 and 100, both
contests of champion versus chal- j
1 lenger. Austin Clapp holds the na- j
■ tional intercollegiate record in the !
220 event, but Wiget has bettered
' his 440 time and is expected to put
' up his main fight in this longer dis- j
I tance.
Gardner Is Champ
Tuppy Gardner is Pacific Coast
champion in the 100 and coast rec
ord-holder in both the 100 and 50. J
as well a? Pacific Association A.A.U.
: champion in the century. McKelvey
boasts a Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
50-yard title and is undaunted by
the ariay of 100-yard marks his j
opponent has garnered.
Following Tuesday's upset of j
Captain Frank Booth by Fred Teb
betts in the 150-yard backstroke,
anything is likely to happen when
these two, along with Bill Rogers,
get alongside each other in the |
1 pool. Instead of a duel between
Tebbetts and Rogers for second
place behind the captain, it now
j looks like a fight between Booth and
Tebbetts for first. Bob Clark, Larry j
Harris, and Ray Wilbur will clash j
j for honors in the breaststroke along
with McGavern, with Clark highly i
favored to touch the finish well ;
ahead of the others.
Seniors Favored
With an imposing collection of I
stars swimming under their colors,
i the seniors are expected to take the
meet without a great deal ot trou
| ble, the sophomores and freshmen
favored next in that order. The
fourth-year men already have no
i less than 15 points to their credit
as a result of water polo and diving j
i victoreis. Yesterday's diving went
to Herb Marsh, of the seniors, Milt
Friedman and George Fuller, both
freshmen, taking second and third,
respectively. Friedman, Fuller, and
| Bob Ward well will handle the ex-
I hibition at this afternoon's fest.
