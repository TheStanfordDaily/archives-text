Entries for Ihe All-University!
Boxing Tournament, to be held the 1
night of February 4 in the Basket
ball Pavilion, will close Monday
night, according to Coach Harry
Maloney. Entrants will weigh in on
Tuesday.
Maloney, his assistant, Myron
Schall, Vance Rogers, varsity man
of three years ago, and Al Portal
are spending the remaining time
before the tournament in giving
individual attention to. the fighters.
All are rapidly rounding into shape
and the matches give promise of
being better than ever before.
Paul Targhetta is training down
to light- heavy and his bout with i

"Slip" Gilbert should prove one of !
the features of the tournament.
Fred Johnson, Jim Bell, and Don j
Flick .ill look good in the middle
weight division. A shade in experi
ence goes to Johnson but one of the
others is bound to give him a real
tussle.
The two unknowns of the light
weight department, Ben Mathews
and Bill Rowland, put on a practice
show last night and there is little to
choose between them. F 1 Insley, in
the same weight ,is coming along in
great shape and may pull a surprise
win. The other weights are as well
taken e< re of and February 4 looks
like a big night for Stanford boxing
fans.
