## Sales Back At Center As Squad Receives Hard Pre-Game Workout 
### Albert Guerard 
With Tom Sales back at the cen- â€¢
tcr post he held down during early j
1 season games, Vance Fawcett's!
yearling hoopsters were sent '
I through a tough scrimmage last i
: night against the reserve hopefuls, j
; but failed to click as smoothly as ;
j they did on the previous afternoon
I against the Phelps-Terkel outfit, j
! when Wally Crowe and Tom Kelly J
' shared the pivot position.
Lory Rothert and Frank Cox*;
I again held down the forward jobs, j
while Gordon Mallatratt and Jim j
Savage played most of the time at j
Ihe guard positions.
Easy Practice Today
Yesterday's scrimmage marked |
the third day of hard toil for the I
Papoose quintet, and they will un
j doubtedly taper off this afternoon j
with a light workout before facing i
U.S.F. frosh and Lowell High quin
| tets on Friday and Saturday eve- |
i nings.
University of .San Francisco year- i
ling team, coached by the Dons'
great guard, Rene Bareilles, have
hung up a fair record against San
Francisco high school fives, but
their work has been weak indeed
compared with the fine record of
Lowell's championship quintet.
Lowell Tip-Off Strong
Although Harry Cordes, Palo Alto
High tip-off man got the jump a
good part of the time from the
Lowellites' giant center, Ritchie
Hay, the latter will probably enable
I his team to control the ball most of
I the time, when he jumps against
the none-too-tall Indian centers,
i The freshmen seem to have
, | reached their peak on Wednesday
; night; so an easy workout will prob
, j ably be in store for today which
. i will do them a world of good. Win
; stead Weaver, the spindly freak
shot artist, was off his eye yester
day, showing none of the uncanny
j accuracy which enabled him to gain
- 1 high-point honors in last Saturday
- afternoon's contest.
