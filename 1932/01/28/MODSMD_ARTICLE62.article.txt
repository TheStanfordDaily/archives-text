# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM WILL MEET POST STREET NINE
## Coach Wolter Concentrates On First And Third Base Positions 
### Bob Wade 
With the second baseball game of
the season, a return contest against
the Olympic Club, scheduled for
Saturday, and his starting line-up
still unannounced, Coach Harry
Wolter last night concentrated on
strengthening the team's two weak
positions, first and third bases.
At third, the veteran mentor has
Jerry Trautman, who is better
known as a golfer but who may de
velop into a first-class replacement
for Dykes Johnson; Bob Maentz, I
shortstop from last season's fresh- j
man nine; Jim Kelly, letterman two |
years ago; and "Pop" Gabriel, a j
transfer.
Trautman Leads
Of the four, Trautman has been j
receiving the call so far, and if he
improves sufficiently in the art of
keeping his eye on the elusive ;
grounders which are invariably the
lot of the third base guardian, he
may continue to lead the aspirants.
His hitting, considering the new
ness of the season, will keep him at
least even with the other three. |
In Maentz, Wolter has what is [
known us an "in and outer." The I
youngster came up last year with j
some of the most spectacular stops j
ever seen on the freshman field, but |
he nullified the rosy glow that these j
cast over his record by missing j
some of the easiest rollers imagin
able. Wolter is bringing him along
slowly so that by the time the con
ference opener arrives he will prob
ably have at least two dependable j
third-sackers.
First Base Tryoutees
The prevailing conditions around
first base are not much different
from those at third. Wolter has five
tryoutees for the post, but none of
them have had any experience to
speak of, and so far none of them
have been very outstanding.
Of the five — Hearn, Goodell, i
Woodworth, Redhead, and Bacon— j
Hearn has shaped up as the best of
the lot. He played on last season's
yearling outfit also, and when he .
learns to handle his feet around the '
initial bag he should be able to fit
"Spud" Hardy's shoes nicely. Farm !
fans will recall that Ralph Cook, j
probably the best first-sacker seen j
around here in recent years, even I
1 hough ho spent most of his time
trying tc escape the faculty axe, was |
a southpaw like Hearn, and could i
cover plenty of territory.
Former Varsity Man
Goodell, who played on the var
sity two years ago, is the most
seasoned performer of the quintet, j
but so far he has failed to show i
enough to put him on the bag dur
ing a game. j
The other three performers rate
in about the above order, with I
Bacon failing to offer much opposi- j
tion because of a heavy scholastic j
schedule.
Stanford came into its own last I
year when the varsity baseball team I
copped the conference title. It was !
not a perfect record that they hung j
up, but it was a most pleasant i
change from the losing outfits that i
preceded it. As Stanford looked in
the season's opener last Saturday, j
they will have to improve plenty to 1
make it two titles in a row. And two '
of the big "ifs" that must of neces
sity enter any talk of a champion
ship are the individuals who will i
hold down first and third base on 1
the 1932 model of the Indian nine. |

transfer.
Trautman Leads
Of the four, Trautman has been j
receiving the call so far, and if he
improves sufficiently in the art of
keeping his eye on the elusive ;
grounders which are invariably the
lot of the third base guardian, he
may continue to lead the aspirants.
His hitting, considering the new
ness of the season, will keep him at
least even with the other three. |
In Maentz, Wolter has what is [
known us an "in and outer." The I
youngster came up last year with j
some of the most spectacular stops j
ever seen on the freshman field, but |
he nullified the rosy glow that these j
cast over his record by missing j
some of the easiest rollers imagin
able. Wolter is bringing him along
slowly so that by the time the con
ference opener arrives he will prob
ably have at least two dependable j
third-sackers.
First Base Tryoutees
The prevailing conditions around
first base are not much different
from those at third. Wolter has five
tryoutees for the post, but none of
them have had any experience to
speak of, and so far none of them
have been very outstanding.
Of the five — Hearn, Goodell, i
Woodworth, Redhead, and Bacon— j
Hearn has shaped up as the best of
the lot. He played on last season's
yearling outfit also, and when he .
learns to handle his feet around the '
initial bag he should be able to fit
"Spud" Hardy's shoes nicely. Farm !
fans will recall that Ralph Cook, j
probably the best first-sacker seen j
around here in recent years, even I
1 hough ho spent most of his time
trying tc escape the faculty axe, was |
a southpaw like Hearn, and could i
cover plenty of territory.
Former Varsity Man
Goodell, who played on the var
sity two years ago, is the most
seasoned performer of the quintet, j
but so far he has failed to show i
enough to put him on the bag dur
ing a game. j
The other three performers rate
in about the above order, with I
Bacon failing to offer much opposi- j
tion because of a heavy scholastic j
schedule.
Stanford came into its own last I
year when the varsity baseball team I
copped the conference title. It was !
not a perfect record that they hung j
up, but it was a most pleasant i
change from the losing outfits that i
preceded it. As Stanford looked in
the season's opener last Saturday, j
they will have to improve plenty to 1
make it two titles in a row. And two '
of the big "ifs" that must of neces
sity enter any talk of a champion
ship are the individuals who will i
hold down first and third base on 1
the 1932 model of the Indian nine. |
With the second baseball game of
the season, a return contest against
the Olympic Club, scheduled for
Saturday, and his starting line-up
still unannounced, Coach Harry
Wolter last night concentrated on
strengthening the team's two weak
positions, first and third bases.
At third, the veteran mentor has
Jerry Trautman, who is better
known as a golfer but who may de
velop into a first-class replacement
for Dykes Johnson; Bob Maentz, I
shortstop from last season's fresh- j
man nine; Jim Kelly, letterman two |
years ago; and "Pop" Gabriel, a j
transfer.
