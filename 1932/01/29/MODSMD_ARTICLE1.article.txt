### Stan Beaubaire 
Sigma Nil vs. Delta Chi, 7 p.m.
—Pavilion.
Kappa Sigma vs. Breakers, 8
p.m.—Pavilion.
Menlo Hashers vs. Beta Theta
Pi, 7 p.m.—Gymnasium.
Chinese Club vs. Sequoia 11. 8
p.m.—Gymnasium.

Coming back from an exception- |
ally ragged first period that ended }
in a 3-3 tie, a fighting Kappa Alpha j
quintet seemingly smothered the El j
Cuadro five 11-3 until the last three !
minutes of play, when, by means
of a lightning attack and one mira
culous bit of luck, the Club men '
raised the total from 11-10 to 12-11
in their favor just as the whistle i
sounded.
Still trailing by a one-point mar- j
gin just as referee Gabriel raised
the whistle to his lips, the Cuadro ;
outfit moved the ball up to mid
floor where Rolph Malloch made a
desperate one-armed pass at the j
basket which left the ball tottering j
on the rim and dropping the hoop j
as the game ended. Frank Curtis j
was high point man for the club, j
while fairly even team-work fea- j
tured the Kappa Alpha playing. The |
last-minute break in defense spoiled
a supposedly safe lead.
Griffin Scores
Theta Chi's hoop squad, looking
rather smooth after the usual run i
of murU team, too ka 25-17 victory '
from the Theta Delts with George
Griffin accounting for 17 of the j
winning points. JefT Minckler with |
8 digits and George Jensen with 6 j
were mainly responsible for the
Theta Delts showing.
Taking the Phi Kaps 18-14 in an
average contest, the Phi Delts made j
the most of 6 points scored by Ed
Woodworth, who played a fairly ac- ,
curate floor game. John Kunau and j
Warner Edmonds shot 2 baskets j
each during the proceedings for the i
Phi Kaps.
El Capitan Wins
El Capitan, playing a better brand !
of ball than last week, managed to I
take the S.A.E. quintet with a 19-16 j
score. George Stump took high point j
honors for the Club with 8 digits
to his credit. Fred Shidler, the 1
smoothest player on the floor, al
though not accounting for any bas
kets because of his guard position, j
greatly aided Hubert Fry in acquir
ing 9 of the Row-men's total.
Schedules for Round 111 of the
tournament will be posted Tuesday, j

average contest, the Phi Delts made j
the most of 6 points scored by Ed
Woodworth, who played a fairly ac- ,
curate floor game. John Kunau and j
Warner Edmonds shot 2 baskets j
each during the proceedings for the i
Phi Kaps.
El Capitan Wins
El Capitan, playing a better brand !
of ball than last week, managed to I
take the S.A.E. quintet with a 19-16 j
score. George Stump took high point j
honors for the Club with 8 digits
to his credit. Fred Shidler, the 1
smoothest player on the floor, al
though not accounting for any bas
kets because of his guard position, j
greatly aided Hubert Fry in acquir
ing 9 of the Row-men's total.
Schedules for Round 111 of the
tournament will be posted Tuesday, j

Pi, 7 p.m.—Gymnasium.
Chinese Club vs. Sequoia 11. 8

Coming back from an exception- |
ally ragged first period that ended }
in a 3-3 tie, a fighting Kappa Alpha j
quintet seemingly smothered the El j
Cuadro five 11-3 until the last three !
minutes of play, when, by means
of a lightning attack and one mira
culous bit of luck, the Club men '
raised the total from 11-10 to 12-11
in their favor just as the whistle i
sounded.
Still trailing by a one-point mar- j
gin just as referee Gabriel raised
the whistle to his lips, the Cuadro ;
outfit moved the ball up to mid
floor where Rolph Malloch made a
desperate one-armed pass at the j
basket which left the ball tottering j
on the rim and dropping the hoop j
as the game ended. Frank Curtis j
was high point man for the club, j
while fairly even team-work fea- j
tured the Kappa Alpha playing. The |
last-minute break in defense spoiled
a supposedly safe lead.
Griffin Scores
Theta Chi's hoop squad, looking
rather smooth after the usual run i
of murU team, too ka 25-17 victory '
from the Theta Delts with George
Griffin accounting for 17 of the j
winning points. JefT Minckler with |
8 digits and George Jensen with 6 j
were mainly responsible for the
Theta Delts showing.
