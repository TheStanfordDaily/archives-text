# 'BIRD IN HAND' OFFERS FAST, SPICY HUMOR
## Play's Success Depends On Skill Of Entire Cast; No Leading Role 
### Harrison Foss 
Rollicking comedy, sparkling
lines, clever characterization, and
charming comedy will be presented
to Stanford playgoers tonight at 8:30
o'clock when the curtain in the As
sembly Hall is drawn on the first
j Dramatic Council production of the
| year—John Drink water's "Bird In
j Hand."
Harold Helvenston is directing
j ''Bird In Hand" and it bids fair to
! rival his former successes. Last
; night's dress rehearsal put the fin-
I ishing polish on all the action and
the completed play is a distinct tri—
| umph for the Dramatic Council.
All Parts Important
Success or failure of the play to
right depends not upon any one
! person in the cast, but rather upon
| every character. "Bird In Hand" is
' unique in that it has no stellar
role, that although there are only
eight characters in the play, a whole
scale of human conditions are rep
! l'esented, from Mr. Blanquet, sar
' dine salesman, being played by
James Sandoe, to aristocratic Sir
I Robert Arnwood, being played by
j Craig Thomas, and in that every
) character is vital to solving the
l problems that the play presents.
Alice Greenleaf, one of the two
I feminine roles, is being taken by
Beulah Dinjmitt. Miss Dimmitt has
i proven herself adept at taking this
j trying role. The part of a woman
j who is neither old or young is the
j most difficult that the young actress
! has to face.
Romance Included
Virginia Wilson and Ruhland
Isaly have been seen on the campus
I stage before. Miss Wilson played a
j leading part in the opera number
iof the 1931 Football Gaieties and
Isaly will be remembered as Sholto
|in the campus production of the
I "Young Idea."
j A newcomer to the Stanford stage,
Dave Davis, will play Ambrose Go
j dolphin. Godolphin is the barrister ,
j who by chance stops at the old "Bird !
In Hand" inn at the time when a i
! climax comes in the life of the fam- j
! ily that owns it.
James Lyons, well-known for his j
j work in "Wings Over Europe," will
! play Cyril Beverly. This part should
I give him an opportunity to repeat
I his former success. Harry Hay will
I have a chance to score a personal
J triumph in the role of Thomas
i Greenleaf, father of Joan. As pro
| tagonist he has more lines than
| anyone else; it is he who voices the
1 theories of the old school.
A few good seats are still obtain
■ able at the A.S.S.U. office and at
Keeble's in Palo Alto. The box of
i fice will be open before the show,
