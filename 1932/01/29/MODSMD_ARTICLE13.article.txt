tatcd the most critical international i
complications of the Sino-Japanese !
conflict by occupying the native I
city.

started in the little mud-brick and
wood houses of the area, and the i
Chinese populace was in consterna- i

The bitterest fighting of the oc- |
cupation, which was carried on j
with the same machine-like preci- j
sion displayed by the Japanese;
when they pushed their Chinese!
enemies out of the cities of Man- j
churia, took place at the very edge
of the international settlement.
Within the barbed-wire bound- j
aries of the settlement patrolled j
United States marines and the mili- j
tary forces of other nations, backed I
by artiilcry and tanks. Advancing '
along the boundaries, the Japanese
attempted to break through these j
defense lines but were refused j
passage.
The civilian male population of |
the foreign city was mobilized, j
armed with rifles, and put on guard
in the business district. No clashes j
between Japanese troops and the j
soldiers of any nation except China i
were reported, but Shanghai was 1
tense with apprehension.
