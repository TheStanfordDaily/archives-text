# Barry, Good Cage Coach, Better Yet As Sculptor
## 
### LOWELL COX 
Sam Barry is all riled up.
Sam, you may remember, is the
j coach of that Southern California
basketball team with the swell liv
ing statuary act. The team ficts in
the lead, and then presents its fam
i ous act, which sometimes lasts for
16 minutes.
Now the fans, of course, pay their
[dough to see basketball, but Sam
gives 'em statuary and makes 'em
I like it. A few of the outraged cash
; customers demanded their money
I back after the act he put on during
! the U.C.L.A. game the other night,
but Sam just figures they didn't
have any esthetic sense.
Then Coach John Bunn, who
teaches Stanford teams basketball
| which makes the customers gulp
I down the peanuts whole and en
joy doing it, said something ought
to be done about that, statuary busi
ness. and that he was going to start
something when the coaches got to
gether for their annual confab this
spring.
"Poof!" said Sum.

! Then Nibs Price, whose University
of California teams have never
failed to satisfy the fans who pay the
I dough that pays his salary, said
John was quite right—that some
thing really must be done.
And now comes word that
U.C.L.A., who handed Barry his
first defeat of the season in a
statuary contest last Saturday,
would rather play basketball
and keep the turnstiles clicking,
"Doggone," exploded Sam, or
words to that effect, when he heard
about it. "That's the last straw.
Don't these fellows over read the
, rule book? Don't, they know that
blame for stalling is fixed on the
team behind in the score? We have
never been guilty of stalling. The
'delayed offense' is good basketball!"
But the fact remains lhat the fans
would rather see action that Sat
urday—and Messrs. Bunn, Price and
Works know it.
And don't be surprised if they do
something about it—and the "de
layed offense" isn't legal next year.
