# DEPRESSION AND ALL'S WELL FOR CAMPUS GIGOLOS
## 
### 
Saturday evening promises to
be a gala night in Stanford's
social history. Attempting the
most stupendous affair of all
time, the W.A.A. is sponsoring
such a depression dance as has
never been tried before.
You don't believe it? All
right! Come and see for your
self. There can be no doubt of
it. Shapiro's Syncopators will
shake down the decorations so
everyone can save the energy
of removing the thumbtacks.
Contrary to the usual Stan
ford custom, the dance will be
from nine to twelve, so all can
be home before dawn. It's a
little bit expensive, but it may
be worth the two-bits a cou
ple. You might as well bring
her along, roughs, as you only
save a nickel by coming alone.
In honor of leap year ladies
will be admitted for a thin
bent dime.
