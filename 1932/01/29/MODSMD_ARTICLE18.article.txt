# HANDLER, SHAW WIN LAW TRIAL
## Respondents Say Common Marriage Valid 
### Jay Graves 
"The recognition of the existence
of such ? relation as common law
marriage is the sort of thing which
promotes the frequency of sexual
crimes and the wrecking of woman
hood," declared Edgar Stewart in
supporting his contention that a
common law marriage is invalid,
before the Stanford Law School
Moot Court last night.
"Childien of a bigamous marriage
are held to be legitimate upon the
death of the first wife, since a com
mon law marriage then ensues,"
was the reply of Marvin Handler.

Judge Lowell Turrentine, Stan
ford Law Professor, reasoning from
the basic conclusion that a common
law marriage is valid, l'endered the
cxtremeiy hot and contested deci
cision in favor of the respondents
in the case at bar, Marvin Handler
and Lucien Shaw.
Edgar Stewart and Ansel Wil
liams, counsel for the appellant,
maintained that since the father
knew lhat lie was committing big
amy at the time of his second mar
riage, the son of that marriage was
legally illegitimate and was not en
titled to a share in his father's
estate.
The defense met this contention
with a pica to consider the position
the son was placed in, decreed il
legitimate by no fault of his own,
and that it was to the interest of
fairness and justice to recognize his
claim of the common law marriage
of his father which would entitle
him to share in the paternal estate,
estate.
Social Concepts
The social concept of the prin
ciple involved was brought in when
the appellants contended that "com
mon law marriage is no longer an
institution of social value." Defense
met this by asserting that it was the
aim of society to protect the inter
ests of the wife who believed that
| she was entering a valid union.

"The recognition of the existence
of such ? relation as common law
marriage is the sort of thing which
promotes the frequency of sexual
crimes and the wrecking of woman
hood," declared Edgar Stewart in
supporting his contention that a
common law marriage is invalid,
before the Stanford Law School
Moot Court last night.
"Childien of a bigamous marriage
are held to be legitimate upon the
death of the first wife, since a com
mon law marriage then ensues,"
was the reply of Marvin Handler.
Turrentine Dccides
Judge Lowell Turrentine, Stan
ford Law Professor, reasoning from
the basic conclusion that a common
law marriage is valid, l'endered the
cxtremeiy hot and contested deci
cision in favor of the respondents
in the case at bar, Marvin Handler
and Lucien Shaw.
Edgar Stewart and Ansel Wil
liams, counsel for the appellant,
maintained that since the father
knew lhat lie was committing big
amy at the time of his second mar
riage, the son of that marriage was
legally illegitimate and was not en
titled to a share in his father's
estate.
The defense met this contention
with a pica to consider the position
the son was placed in, decreed il
legitimate by no fault of his own,
and that it was to the interest of
fairness and justice to recognize his
claim of the common law marriage
of his father which would entitle
him to share in the paternal estate,
estate.
Social Concepts
The social concept of the prin
ciple involved was brought in when
the appellants contended that "com
mon law marriage is no longer an
institution of social value." Defense
met this by asserting that it was the
aim of society to protect the inter
ests of the wife who believed that
| she was entering a valid union.
