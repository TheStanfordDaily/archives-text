LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28—(Special
j to Stanford Daily)—Splrred on by
! their 19-17 defeat handed the Tro
| jans last week, Coach Caddy Works'
i Bruin varsity cage team is ready and
; waiting for the Stanford Indians
■ tomorrow night. The Bruins and
j Indians meet in a two game series
jat the Olympic auditorium tomor
i row and Saturday nights.
After dropping four straight con
' ference games, the Bruins have
! come into their own. Although
' hampered to a great extent by the
{ poor physical condition of Captain
, Dick Linthicum and Don Piper, star
j forwards, the Bruins went into the
j second half of their game last week
! determined to upset the league
i leading Trojans.
The first half was taken up by the
I Trojans' now famous 16-minute stall,
j which left the Bruins with ample
j strength to set the pace in the sec-
I ond half and win the game, 19 to 17.
With all of the injured list well
|on the road to recovery with the
! exception of Carson Ginkley, center,
] the Bruins will once more take the
I floor with their full strength.
j The starting line-up as released by
I Coach Works is as follows: Captain
j Dick Linthicum and Don Piper, for
wards; Bud Rose, center; Ted
Lcmcke and George Brotemarkle,
I guards. Although handicapped by
j their late start, the Bruins have
I avowed themselves to make quite a
| path for themselves in their last
j games. Six games remain on the
j Bruin schedule this season. The two
j Indian contests will be followed next
| week with a double bill up north
! with the Bears. The Bruins will
j conclude the season with the final
I two games with the Trojans on the
| following two week-ends.
