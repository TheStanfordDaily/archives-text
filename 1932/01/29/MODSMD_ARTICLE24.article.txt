# Thirteen Indian Cagers Go South For Bruin Games
## Contests Should Be Even; Stanford's Early Season Victories Over U.C.L.A. Offset by Latter's Defeat of League-Leading Trojans CORDRY MAY START AT ONE FORWARD BERTH Coach John Bunn Expects Offense To Click; Cards Must Win to Remain in Conference Running 
### DICK RODDA 
IIIRTEEN Stanford hoop stars left for Los Angeles last night for Hie
first Indian invasion of the Southland this year, opening the second
half of the conference season against the U.C.L.A. Bruins tonight in the
j Olympic Auditorium. A second game will he played Saturday night.
Because the Cardinals are handicapped again by cripples and because
I "Caddy" Works' Bruins arc apparently rejuvenated after having defeated
the Trojans last week, the Indians can hardly be installed favorites this
i week even though they have already twice conquered U.C.L.A. here.
The Card mentor, John Bunn, however, expects his offense to click
better than ever before and is planning to "shoot the works" against the
Uclans. Bunn realizes that it was only through almost perfect free-throw
shooting that the Indians were able to defeat the Bruins before. That

the contests will be of the fast type
lias already been demonstrated here.
Stanford's hopes were further
strengthened yesterday when it was
learned that "Tiny Tom" Cordry
will probably be in the lineup to
night at the sound of the first
whistle. Bill Doub, center, will also
start. Both Doub and Cordry have
not played since the last games with
U.C.L.A.
Go on Lark
Incidentally, the thirteen men who
boarded the Lark last night were
LaCombe, Cosgrove. Cordry, Glas
gow, Palmer, Lambert, Jenkins,

| Packard, Doub, Norgard, Hancock,
j Baker, and Tod. The first-named
| si* are forwards, the next three ar®
| centers, and the quartet beginning
| with Norgard are guards.
i Bunn will start LaCombe and
] either Cosgrove or Cordry at the
■ forward berths, Doub at center, and
j Norgard and Hancock at the guards.
, The seven remaining subs will
| probably all see.action before the
i two games are concluded.
Bunn gave the boys a rest last
i night, drilling them in free throws
! and cutting the practice of! short.
Brlin Starters
j Caddy Works will start his rcgu
: lar Bruin five of Linthicum and
j Piper, forwards; Rose, center; and
! Lemcke and Brotemarkle, guards,
j Last week they played their best
i game of the year, defeating the
i U.S.C. Trojans after having let the
I Trojans stall for 16 minutes of the
J first half with a lead of 5 to 2.
By again defeating the Bruins
| Stanford will still be in the race for
! the championship as ihey still have
| a chance to get even with U.S.C. on
the following week-end and with
1 California in the last two games of
i the year.
