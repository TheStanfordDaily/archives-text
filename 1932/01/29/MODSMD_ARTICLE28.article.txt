# FOR BONNIE ANNIE LAURIE
## 
### 
Alas for chivalry! One Kdwin L. Williams, who rose
l<> the defense of 111 1>sc o'irJs who so indiscreetly invaded
the sacred precincts of Tovon Hall last Saturday night,
draws the lire of Mrs. Winifred Black (we think that is the
name) who writes a daily column for the San Francisco
Examiner under the hv-line of "Annie Laurie."
Mrs. Laurie-Black, being a woman, might be expected
to commiserate her three sisters who were subjected to
obviously discourteous treatment. But does she? Catch a
load of the following opening paragraph in yesterday's
Examiner.
"A certain rather surprising gentleman down in Palo
Alto appears to be not only indignant, but scandalized be
cause the students in a Stanford dormitory received some
unexpected feminine visitors with cat calls, whistles and
hoots of derision.
"Tut Int, Sir Lancelot. Likewise pish, tush, and oh
shucks.
"What, may I ask you, did the visiting ladies expect?
"Garlands of delicate roses perhaps, arms full of modest
violets, and maybe a de luxe edition apiece of a volume
of sweet verse dedicated to Youth, Beauty and Innocence.
"Well, that isn't Ihe way things happen in this rather
reasonable world of ours."
Mrs. Laurie goes on at greater length, the object of her
dissertation being that women who are so bold as to go to
men's dormitories at any time of the day deserve nothing
but large razzings from Ihe idealistic male who likes to put
girls 011 a pedes'tal.
Mrs. Black-Laurie is wrong on only two counts. First,
three women, escorted by three men, have every right to
expect courteous treatment when they do visit a men's
dormitory on this campus. Second, the razzing handed out
was directed primarily at Ihe men, the women being noth
ing more than catalytic agents. As for men tending to
place women on a pedestal, pish tush and a bucket of
horseradish. What more evidence to I lie contrary is neces
sary than Saturday's rumpus?
