# WAR TO PREVENT WAR
## 
### 
Now thai Japan has indicated by her occupation of
Shanghai that she is not bluffing with her aggressive atti
tude, it is time that the world wake lip to that realization.
The situation is pregnant with dangers and a definite
course of action looking to the removal of the problem
should be undertaken.
Japan has been cracking the whip because she knows
that the League of Nations will try every other alternative
than going to war to enforce its decrees. Therein lies the
very weakness of the League. There is no coercive force,
other than opinion, to keep a recalcitrant member nation
in line. So when a nation is sullieicntly hold and sullicicntlv
powerful, il may take war to prevent war. Then what has
been accomplished?
.Japan could be seriously handicapped and ultimately
rendered nearly powerless by economic pressure, owing to
Ihe limited resources of the island empire. However, this
move would take time to put in force. And it, also, might
lead lo war!
The most serious aspect of the whole problem is that
war, when il does break out, will involve the whole world.
