Once again students will he able to enjoy an evening's
entertainment at very little cost. The W.A.A. is sponsoring
a depression dance Saturday night in Roble gym from 9 to
12 o'clock. The price is twenty-five cents a couple, or
twenty cents for a single male and ten cents for a lone
co-ed.
Seldom are Stanfordites able to dance all evening for
such a small outlay and, when the chance occurs, they
should not fail to attend. Depression dances which have
been held so far have been a success, but, when the price
of admission is so low, a large crowd is necessary that the
venture may not be a financial failure.
Thus it is up to the students to give their support to
this enterprise, which is conducted for their benefit, in
order that the future may bring bigger and cheaper de
pression dances.
Herb Shapiro's orchestra will furnish the music for the
occasion, so cough up a quarter, roughs, in return for which
you will receive a pleasant evening and, perhaps, establish
permanently the idea of two-bit hops.
