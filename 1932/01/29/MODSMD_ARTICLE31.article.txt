# BULL SESSION
## DO WE KNOW THE SCORE 
### 
Most collegians would rather be
sophisticated than eat. That is prob
ably a desirable characteristic for
eating is a very ordinary accom
plishment that anybody can master
while true sophistication is a rare
art—a fine art. The sophisticated
attitude is the exact opposite of the
naive. This latter takes everything
for grunted— enamel to be
the real thing; whether the thin
covering happens to be political
bunk, philosophical sophistry, or fe
male makeup. Sophistication, on the
other hand, perceives the bunk in
politicians, the sophistry in philoso
phers, and the makeup (both physi
cal and intellectual) in women.
Now, because most things are
enamel, the college sophomore and
freshman thinks that the sure road
to his ideal is to scoff at everything.
This makes him look somewhat
foolish in laughing at everything, he
is laughing at some real things.
Nothing is sadder than to see some
would-be college intellectual start
ridiculing politics at about 9 o'clock
in the evening and before the party
breaks up, everything from religion
to romance, has felt what he thinks
is the lash of some very biting sar
casm indeed.
For fear cf showing enthusiasm at
something that does not merit it,
this collegiate is bored at every
thing. Not wishing to exert the in
tellectual effort at discerning be
tween the enamel and the real thing,
he takes the easy path and gives
forth a gentle and polite half-yawn

at anytning tnat anyoody else thinks
is worthwhile.
It is easy to simulate the sophisti
cate —it is even fairly easy to be
really sophisticated during periods
when the only stress to marr the
peace is Amos and Andy, Walter
Winchell, and similar annoyances.
The real test comes during periods
of excitement when intellectual re
serve is swept away by emotional
appeal. To be sophisticated over the
dinner table is hardly comparable
to seeing the real thing during the
heat of a political campaign. Today
many college students can discuss
all about political bunk, and bosses;
how many will be able to discern
the kernel 'midst the chaff in No
vember 1932? How many will even
try to? Will not most of us vote
like our families, our committees,
our habits?
In war or in periods where war
is threatening, sophistication is par
ticularly rare. How strong is colle
giate sophistication? At present, any
number can talk about the economic
factors behind war, the uselessness
of war, and all that sort of thing.
But if headlines begin to fly, if the
bugles begin to toot, if the bands
break forth with "Stars and Stripes
Forever," how many of us will still
sit back and view the matter in
tellectually? That is the acid test;
and it is in those times that colle
gians will be pfoved; and we hope
not found wanting.
