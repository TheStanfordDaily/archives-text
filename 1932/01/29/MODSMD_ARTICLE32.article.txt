BROOME STAGES—By Cclemence
Dane. Doubleday, Doran and
Company. Garden City, New
York, 1931. $:J. (Al the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
A book for those who like the
Forsyte Saga type of thing, a fam
ily with all its ramifications traced
through generations.
Clemence Dane manages to make
very real this tale of a great Eng
lish stage family, from the time
young Richard Broome-maker tum
bled through the barn roof into the
midst of a company of strolling
actors in the year 1730 down to the
pxesent day. The people are de
lightfully distinct and different,
though there is a thread of family
likeness running through all to add
to the interest.
The rise and fall of generations,
the sense of the continuous flow of
life, seems to be the underlying
theme of the book. We see the
young rebelling against Ihe old,
growing up and having" families,
and having their children in turn

rebel against them. Perhaps this
keeps the book real in spite of the
continuous and 'unnecessary disser
tations lon the Broome charm.

ARIEL DANCES—By Ethel Cook
Eliot. Published by Little, Brown
and Company. $2. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
Cinderella gone modern. The title
as a phrase is suggestive of the
beauty and charm which Ariel
lends the story from the time when
she serves as an inspiration to her
artist father ia Bermuda, until, an
orphan, she is transported to the
somewhat unending family life of
Hugh Weyman, her father's young
friend.
Gregory Clare had painted two
hundred Bermudan landscapes, all
bearing as a sort of signature, the
dancing figure of his daughter. The
disposal of these pictures leads
Ariel into silent battle with Joan
Nevin, the beautiful widow who has
gained a curious ascendancy over
Hugh. But Ariel knows how to
dance while she waits for Joan to
betray herself, knows how to give
Hugh's sister a fresh hold on life,
and how to satisfy Grandma
man's need for brave spirit to match
her own.
Romantic, and delightful reading.
