# The 						WINDJAMMER

### 
Now i f seems that there is going
to be a Bird in Hand this evening,
to draw forth chirps of approval
from all the poachers who are
lucky enough to be on deck. The
next question being what kind of
a bird is it, and whose is the hand
concerned? Is the hand neatly
gloved or is it just anybody's or
dinary mit? Does the bird caw, or
is it of the nightingalish variety
commonly known to the Steenford
campus?
For the first time in remem
bered history the regular staff
is going to have a chance for a
normal, sleeping, Sunday, when
the ancient order of Razzberry
holds sway in the Daily office.
It seems that a bunch of funny
men have contained themselves
as long as possible, and are
ready to hurst forth in gleeful
roasting of the world in gen
eral. All we know about it is
practically nothing, and tin*
only useful advice we can con
tribute is a warning to all near
or would-be-big shots run for
cover.
We haven't said anything funny

! for such a long time now that we've
1 gotten out of the habit. Moans and
I groans follow us wherever we go,
| but custom can't be broken. We
j acknowledge our weakness, and the
! receipt of all your complaints. It's
i just that we've forgotten how.
The latest prize that's risen to at
tention, in the goofy-examination
line, is the answer to the question,
I "Why do we have to have public
| fish and game laws?"
And the bright prodigy's an
swer, "We have to have game
j laws because without them the
1 game wouldn't be fair. We have
to have fish laws because the
female fish have to have time
i to go up the river to spoon."
Well ....
