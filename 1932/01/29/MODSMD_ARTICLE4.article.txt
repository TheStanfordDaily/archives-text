# ABANDON HOPE FOR LOST SUB
## Naval Heads Hold Rescue Efforts Now Futile 
### 
PORTLAND, Eng., Jan. 28. (TP)—
The sunken submarine M-2, hold
j ing three score men within her steel
! hulk, still rolled at the bottom of
j the English channel tonight and the
j British admiralty announced the
i possibility of saving any lives was
i ''almost beyond hope."
Desperate efforts were being
made, nevertheless, to reach an ob
l ject eighteen fathoms below the
surface off Portsmouth, which naval
' officials believed might be the ill—
! fated craft.
The battle against choppy seas
j and swirling tides was spurred on
jby the reception of "sub-surface
I signals" on the hydrophone of the
! destroyer Thruster and by a great
i patch of oil discovered by the de
j stroyer Sabre.
Rescuo workers were aware, how-
I ever, that there was not a moment
i to be wasted. The official estimate
jof from forty-eight to fifty-six
i hours in which the crew could re
j main alive expired about 6:30 to
j night, but with exceptionally fa
| vorable circumstances it was be
; lieved they might have a few hours
more.
