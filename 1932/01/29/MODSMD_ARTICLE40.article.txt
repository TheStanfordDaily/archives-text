# Freshman Basketeers Meet S.F.U. Tonight In Pavilion
## CLOSELY MATCHED QUINTETS PROMISE SPEEDY CAGE TILTS Game Will Start Early; Audience Can Attend 'Bird In Hand" 
### Albert Guerard 
Expected to present one of the
season's fastest cage tilts, the year
ling quintets of Stanford and the
University of San Francisco will
meet this evening in the Basketball
Pavilion at 7 o'clock. Both Vance
Fawcett's Papooses and Jack
O'Marie's Dons have been playing
heads-up ball of late, and all in
dications point to a close and speedy
game.
The two teams will end their ri
valry at 7:50 o'clock, which will al
low Stanford entertainment-seekers
time to attend the much-heralded
campus production of "Bird in
Hand." There is no admission charge
for the basketball game; therefore i
a large crowd is expected.
Had Poor Start
The U.S.F. team, off to a mediocre
start thi: season, showed signs of
leal strength in coming from be
hind to defeat the St. Malay's fresh
men, 24-22. Class of '35 supporters
will remember that it was this lat
ter team that handed the Papooses
such a beating in their third game
of the season.
The torrid struggle for the start
ing center berth has resulted, tem
porarily, in favor of Tom Sales, j
chiefly because of a height advan
tage over the other center candi
dates, Wally Crowe and Tom Kelly.
Of the trio, Crowe is unquestionably
the best basketball player, but he
is far 100 short to get the ball off
the backboard. Kelly has a good
eye and lloor game, but is none too I
strong on tip-offs and guarding his j
man. All three will probably see
action in tonight's game.
Rothert, Cox Start
Lory Rothert and Frank Cox are I
the starting forwards with Charles J
Coiner ready to go in at any time. [
Gordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte I
again hold down the guard posi
tions, in spite of improved showings
made by reserve players through
out the week. Mallatratt and Butte
are probably the two best players
on the team, at the present time. ,
Friday's contest should provide
some of the best, fastest basketball
of the year, as U.S.F. showed their
speed in winning from the Gael i
Frosh, after trailing by thirteen j
points, with only ten minutes to i
play. Local fans are still talking |
about the sensational struggle be- j
tween the Bear Cubs and the
Papooses last week, in which there
was little holding the ball for six- '
teen-minute stretches or over-care- !
ful offensive drives.
Lowell Tomorrow
Saturday night Fawcett's charges j
face th j well-nigh impossible task j
of downing Lowell High, one of the |
best basketball teams in the state, I
outside of club arid university com- j
petition. But pre-game dope had it !
that Stockton High's fine quintet j
would walk all over the Indians, ;
yet final score favored the Papooses !
22-21. LoWell boasts a 38-7 victory I
the California freshmen. That's I
something!

start thi: season, showed signs of
leal strength in coming from be
hind to defeat the St. Malay's fresh
men, 24-22. Class of '35 supporters
will remember that it was this lat
ter team that handed the Papooses
such a beating in their third game
of the season.
The torrid struggle for the start
ing center berth has resulted, tem
porarily, in favor of Tom Sales, j
chiefly because of a height advan
tage over the other center candi
dates, Wally Crowe and Tom Kelly.
Of the trio, Crowe is unquestionably
the best basketball player, but he
is far 100 short to get the ball off
the backboard. Kelly has a good
eye and lloor game, but is none too I
strong on tip-offs and guarding his j
man. All three will probably see
action in tonight's game.
Rothert, Cox Start
Lory Rothert and Frank Cox are I
the starting forwards with Charles J
Coiner ready to go in at any time. [
Gordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte I
again hold down the guard posi
tions, in spite of improved showings
made by reserve players through
out the week. Mallatratt and Butte
are probably the two best players
on the team, at the present time. ,
Friday's contest should provide
some of the best, fastest basketball
of the year, as U.S.F. showed their
speed in winning from the Gael i
Frosh, after trailing by thirteen j
points, with only ten minutes to i
play. Local fans are still talking |
about the sensational struggle be- j
tween the Bear Cubs and the
Papooses last week, in which there
was little holding the ball for six- '
teen-minute stretches or over-care- !
ful offensive drives.
Lowell Tomorrow
Saturday night Fawcett's charges j
face th j well-nigh impossible task j
of downing Lowell High, one of the |
best basketball teams in the state, I
outside of club arid university com- j
petition. But pre-game dope had it !
that Stockton High's fine quintet j
would walk all over the Indians, ;
yet final score favored the Papooses !
22-21. LoWell boasts a 38-7 victory I
the California freshmen. That's I
something!
Expected to present one of the
season's fastest cage tilts, the year
ling quintets of Stanford and the
University of San Francisco will
meet this evening in the Basketball
Pavilion at 7 o'clock. Both Vance
Fawcett's Papooses and Jack
O'Marie's Dons have been playing
heads-up ball of late, and all in
dications point to a close and speedy
game.
The two teams will end their ri
valry at 7:50 o'clock, which will al
low Stanford entertainment-seekers
time to attend the much-heralded
campus production of "Bird in
Hand." There is no admission charge
for the basketball game; therefore i
a large crowd is expected.
