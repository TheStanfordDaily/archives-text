A PAIR OF dog fights loom for
the Oakland Auditorium tonight
and tomorrow night, when Nibs
Price's Bears will entertain "Silent
Sam" Barry's Trojans in a return
engagement.
That Price may "fight fire"
was hinted at by the Bear leader
at the close of the two-game
series played in Los Angeles at
the opening of the season. The
California quintet dropped both
contests, one of which was fea
tured by a lengthy stall, and
both by Trojan roughness.
On that occasion Price did not
have Stone and others of his foot
ball plajers with him—but he'll
have 'epi this time.
PRICE HAS indicated that he will
send his forwards after the Trojan
guards when they attempt stalling,
insuring fast play, just as Coach
John Bunn did when the Southern
ers invaded this campus.
It is just possible, however, that
he will bold back his forwards once
or- twjce during the series to show
what /would happen if the defensive
team''didn't force the play. Bunn
did this during the series here. .
JACK SHARKEY, who has
been characterized as the "most
successful failure in the prize
ring," has been involved in so
many scraps in which fouls or
alleged fouls have been commit
ted that it has been suggested
that the contestants in the forth
coming Sharkey-Schmcling bat
tle be armed with barrels.
All of which might not be a
bad idea for some basketball
teams—it would keep the knees
where they belong.

THOSE BRUINS will be no lunch
for th-j Indians this week-end. Al
though they have won only one
game since the conference opened,
they have given every opponent a
tough time of it.
Stanford, in defeating the
Westwooders twice, did so by
the narrow margin of foul shots.
In one game U.C.L.A. scored as
many field goals as the Indians,
and one more in the other.
It will be remembered (who could
forget?) that '"Tiny Tom" Cordry
broke up that second game after
Caddy Works' quintet apparently
had it on ice. And Tom has been
bothered ever since by a slightly
cracked fibula bone which kept him
out of practice for most of the time.
STUART WELLS, sports editor of
the U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin, sends the
following:
"The game with S.C. Saturday
night was a wow. The Trojans got
out in front, 5-2, after about four
minutes oi play, and then just hung
onto the ball. Caddy Works wouldn't
let. his men suck in, and the players
stood rooted to the floor for the
remaining 16 minutes of the half.
"Caddy read a newspaper,
the band played 'Down by the
Old IVlili Stream,' and a helluva
time was had by all. In the sec
ond half tl\e Bruins went after
S.C. and took the battle right
away from them. Piper had a
great night."

Had Barry not been so stubborn,
he could have won the game easily,
as both Piper and Linthicum, Works'
scoring stars, had been ill and could
not have lasted through a fast game.
THREE ATTEMPTS to w reck
the southbound "Lark", have
been made near Watsonville
Junction in the last 10 days. On
Wednesday night an open switch
nearly did the job.
Coach Bunn and his Indian
band, before leaving for the
South last night, declared they
intended to get oIT and walk
past that vicinity. —L.M.C.

the southbound "Lark", have
been made near Watsonville
Junction in the last 10 days. On
Wednesday night an open switch
nearly did the job.
Coach Bunn and his Indian
band, before leaving for the
South last night, declared they
intended to get oIT and walk
past that vicinity. —L.M.C.
A PAIR OF dog fights loom for
the Oakland Auditorium tonight
and tomorrow night, when Nibs
Price's Bears will entertain "Silent
Sam" Barry's Trojans in a return
engagement.
That Price may "fight fire"
was hinted at by the Bear leader
at the close of the two-game
series played in Los Angeles at
the opening of the season. The
California quintet dropped both
contests, one of which was fea
tured by a lengthy stall, and
both by Trojan roughness.
On that occasion Price did not
have Stone and others of his foot
ball plajers with him—but he'll
have 'epi this time.
PRICE HAS indicated that he will
send his forwards after the Trojan
guards when they attempt stalling,
insuring fast play, just as Coach
John Bunn did when the Southern
ers invaded this campus.
It is just possible, however, that
he will bold back his forwards once
or- twjce during the series to show
what /would happen if the defensive
team''didn't force the play. Bunn
did this during the series here. .
JACK SHARKEY, who has
been characterized as the "most
successful failure in the prize
ring," has been involved in so
many scraps in which fouls or
alleged fouls have been commit
ted that it has been suggested
that the contestants in the forth
coming Sharkey-Schmcling bat
tle be armed with barrels.
All of which might not be a
bad idea for some basketball
teams—it would keep the knees
where they belong.

THOSE BRUINS will be no lunch
for th-j Indians this week-end. Al
though they have won only one
game since the conference opened,
they have given every opponent a
tough time of it.
Stanford, in defeating the
Westwooders twice, did so by
the narrow margin of foul shots.
In one game U.C.L.A. scored as
many field goals as the Indians,
and one more in the other.
It will be remembered (who could
forget?) that '"Tiny Tom" Cordry
broke up that second game after
Caddy Works' quintet apparently
had it on ice. And Tom has been
bothered ever since by a slightly
cracked fibula bone which kept him
out of practice for most of the time.
STUART WELLS, sports editor of
the U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin, sends the
following:
"The game with S.C. Saturday
night was a wow. The Trojans got
out in front, 5-2, after about four
minutes oi play, and then just hung
onto the ball. Caddy Works wouldn't
let. his men suck in, and the players
stood rooted to the floor for the
remaining 16 minutes of the half.
"Caddy read a newspaper,
the band played 'Down by the
Old IVlili Stream,' and a helluva
time was had by all. In the sec
ond half tl\e Bruins went after
S.C. and took the battle right
away from them. Piper had a
great night."

Had Barry not been so stubborn,
he could have won the game easily,
as both Piper and Linthicum, Works'
scoring stars, had been ill and could
not have lasted through a fast game.
