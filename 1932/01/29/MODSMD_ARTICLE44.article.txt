the Pittsburgh Pirates. He has
served in National League, the

! nessed. But two games were lost
; that year behind Montgomery's
! hurling, those to the Los Angeles
i club of the Pacific Coast League
| and- the University of California

Montgomery was a left-handed
i pitcher. His record for the 1924 sea
