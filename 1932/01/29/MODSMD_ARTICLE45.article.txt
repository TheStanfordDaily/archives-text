# SENIORS CAPTURE INTERCLASS SWIM HONORS BY POINT
## Two Coast Records Broken In 100, 50, By Gardner And McKelvey 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
j Interclass swimming honors went
I to the seniors yesterday afternoon
j by a margin so close that a gust of
j wind might have turned the tide in
j favor of the sophomores, who cap
-1 tured second place with a bare
j single point to go. The final score,
| including water polo and diving,
| was 42 for the seniors, 41 for the
] sophomores, and 29 and 27 for the
freshmen and juniors, respectively.
Expecting to come through with
| a good lead, the fourth-year men
I attribute their narrow escape to the
! fact that Austin Clapp was out of
1 all events with an injured leg, en
' abling Ted Wiget to capture the
i 220. Another big factor was the sur
! prising upset of Captain Frank
; Booth, swimming for the seniors, at
the hands of junior Fred Tebbetts
in the 150-yard backstroke.
Two coast records were unoffi
| cially broken, however, in the 50
j and 100, the former by John Mc
j Kelvey and the latter by Tuppy
i Gardner. Fairly splitting the water
i apart, McKelvey finished in :23.G
| time in the 50, Gardner coming

j by a margin so close that a gust of
j wind might have turned the tide in
j favor of the sophomores, who cap
-1 tured second place with a bare

freshmen and juniors, respectively.
Expecting to come through with

I attribute their narrow escape to the
! fact that Austin Clapp was out of
1 all events with an injured leg, en
' abling Ted Wiget to capture the
i 220. Another big factor was the sur
! prising upset of Captain Frank
; Booth, swimming for the seniors, at
the hands of junior Fred Tebbetts
in the 150-yard backstroke.
Two coast records were unoffi
| cially broken, however, in the 50
j and 100, the former by John Mc
j Kelvey and the latter by Tuppy
i Gardner. Fairly splitting the water
i apart, McKelvey finished in :23.G

1 record for the former is:24.2 and
