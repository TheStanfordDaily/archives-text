Coach Harry Maluney yesterday
announced the names of the offi
cials who are to have charge of the
annual all-University boxing tour
nament, to be held next Thursday
night at 8 o'clock in the Basketball
Pavilion. Peter Flanagan, former
amateur middleweight champion of
Australia, will again officiate as
a eferee.
Pfctrcy Locey, athletic director of
the Olympic Club, will be the al
ternate referee, while Ad Sandell,
boxing commissioner of the Pacific
Athletic Association, and Joe Nider
ost of the Olympic Club are to be
the judges-
Alternate judges will be Mort
Blackburn and Wells Goodeneuugh,
two Palo Alto men who have served
in this capacity at other University
tournaments. Fred Frehe is to be
the timekeeper with Fred Glover,
disabled captain of the varsity box
ing squad, as his assistant.
Two former Stanford champions,
Duke Brown and Vance Rogers,
will act as seconds. Governor Rolph
will be on hand to present gold
medals to the winners.
This year the "Gene Tunney
Awards" heretofore given to win
ners in the tournament will not be
presented until the end of the sea
son. Tunney, at the suggestion of
Malonoy, has decided to award them
on a basis of "character and athletic
merit" shown throughout the sea
son. Any man in the University,
whether eligible for boxing or not,
is privileged to try for one of these
awards.
According to Maloney and his as
sistants, this year's tournament will
be the most interesting set of
matches to be fought here in many
years. There are at least two close
contenders in every weight division
find three or more in some. All are
in excellent shape, and from the
winners a practically unbeatable
varsity team is likely to be pro
duced.
Admission to the bouts will be
free with student body cards and
50c without.
