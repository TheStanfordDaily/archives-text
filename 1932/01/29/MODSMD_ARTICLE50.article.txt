# ANDERSON HURLS AGAINST CLUBMEN
## Diamond Coach Searches For Pitching Ace 
### Bob Wade 
Having a general idea of what
Caddel and Estes can do along the
hurling line, from their work in
last Saturday's tussle with the
Olympic Club, Coach Harry Wolter
will continue his experimenting
Saturday afternoon in a return en
gagement with the Clubmen, when
he starts Stan Anderson on the
mound.
Anderson, who pitched ' very
creditably lor the freshmen last
year, is the youngster whom the
fans are expecting to till in for Dan
Johnson. He has the speed, and the
stuff, but whether he has had
enough experience to stand up un
der varsity competition will be
shown when the Post Street aggre
gation takes its bats back Saturday
night.
Should Anderson fail to deliver
the goods, Wolter will probably try
Walte Cooper, Estes, or Caddel.
On first base, Fred Goodell will
make his initial appearance of the
season, in fact the first in two years,
and the members of the "hot stove
league" are anxious to see how he
stacks up with the young sopho
more, Art Hearn.
The rest of the starting line-up is
the same as the one that took the
field a week ago: catcher, Ike Liver
more; second base, Vince Philippi;
third base, Jerry Trautman; short
stop, Bert Delmas; left field, "Lefty"
Goldmann; center field, Rudy Rin
tala: and right field, Gordy Camp
bell.
