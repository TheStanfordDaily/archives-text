# STANFORD FENCERS IN STIFF PRACTICE FOR MEET TONIGHT
## 
### 
Amid the slashing of swords, the
flashing of foils, and the uttering of
unintelligible French commands,
Stanford's fencers went through a
stiff series of practice bouts yesterday
in preparation for this evening's
meet.
Since a fencing team consists of
but three members, one of the four
successful tryoutees will compete in
the meet in the role of referee or
spectator. The four are Captain
Leonard Pockman, Dick Criley, John
Ferguson, and Fred Pearman, and
the lucky trio will be chosen from
among them.
Tonight's meet is to determine
the team championship in the foils
ol the Bay Division of the A.F.L.A.
As was true last week when the
saber championship was decided,
the Olympic Club will undoubtedly
send down a team. There is also a
chance that California will enter.
The meet will be held in the main
floor of Encina Gym, and will start
at 8 o'clock. Admission is free, and
an audience is invited.
Cancer is more prevalent in the
United States among families of
British origin than those of Ifalian
origin.
