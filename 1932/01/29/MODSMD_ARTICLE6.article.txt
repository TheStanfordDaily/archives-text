# STUDENTS TO FORM LATIN-AMERICA CLUB
## 
### 
Planning the organization of an
institution entirely new to the cam
pus, all students interested in Latin-
America will, meet Monday eve
ning at 8 o'clock in room 403, En
cina Hall. The purpose of the meet
ing, which is being called under the
direction of Dana Burnett and Ma
noel de Silveira Soares Cardozo, is
to effect the arrangement of a Stan
ford Latin-American club.
It is hoped that such an organi
zation will make it possible for those
students from Latin-America now
attending Stanford as well as any
others who are interested in the
country to become acquainted with
each other. Students who may go
to Latin-America to work are es
pecially invited.
