# ROBERT BROWN CHOSEN HONOR SCOUT OF U. s.
## Well Known Human Being Wins Honors As Head Of Troop 22 TIES SUPERB SLIPKNOT Eagle Scout Reads Latin In Law Libe Daily 
### 
Announcement that Robert M.
Brown, the well-known human be
ing, had been chosen "Mr. Boy Scout
of America," by the National Scout
Executive Committee was revealed
here yesterday by Robert M. Brown.
Brown, leader of the Wolf Patrol,
Troop 22, has had a meteoric career
at Stanford. Entering Stanford as a
second-class Scout, he was soon
elected a member of Breakers Club,
an organization made up exclusive
ly of second-class scouts. He soon
became an Eagle Scout, as anyone
who has heard him scream may tes
tify.
Running Helps
His work on the track team easily
stamped him as the outstanding
candidate for the presidency of the
A.S.S.U., an office which he single
handed has raised to its present
high standard.
During the Christmas holidays
there was a big drunken brawl held
somewhere, as the result of which
Brown was named for a Rhodes
scholarship. Robert will go to Ox
ford next fall. He is preparing for
that prospect by bringing a Latin
grammar into the Law Library each
day.
Brown's appointment as Mr. Boy
Scout came as no surprise to Brown,
he declared. He holds twenty-one
merit badges, all for stamp-collect
ing.
Want Track Men
"I intend to cut politics out of the
A.S.S.U. by making all the posi
tions on the Men's Council and the
Executive Committee appointive.
There have been too many students
elected by a short-sighted student
body. The proportion of track men
on those two responsible bodies is
far too small. Something must be
done about it."
So saying, he coyly twisted the
ring on his little finger. The ring
bears the inscription, "A.H.S., '31,"
and may stand either for "Anna
Head School," in which case Brown
probably stole it, or it may mean
'"A Hot Shot," which would indi
cate that Brown bought it. At all
events, the reporter left in a hurry
as Patrol Leader Brown began to
tie a slip-knot in preparation for
his 22nd merit badge.
