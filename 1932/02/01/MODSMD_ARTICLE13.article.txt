# Yost Eliminates Red Tape; Work Sped In Council
## One Woman Suspended, Two More Penalized 
### 
| A special meeting of the Women's j
: Council was called Friday afternoon j
by Miss Mary Yost, dean of women.
. None of the members appeared ex
! cept Dean Yost, who declared her
self a quorum with full power to
| act. Miss Yost justified her action!
on the grounds that no member ol i
the Council had ever advanced an j
original idea or commented ad- j
versely on any of her opinions, ,
merely voting unanimously in favor j
of anything she proposed.
As the meeting was urgent, Miss ;
Yost decided to dispense with thei
! formality of a Council vote and!
passed unanimously the following 1
: resolutions:
Illegal Rushing Hinted
Barbara Beach Thompsy'i and ;
Miriam Strout were penalized the 1
1 loss of their dates for the coming \
| week-end for conduct unbecoming |
a Stanford woman. Miss Yost hinted
' at illegal rushing and commented j
pointedly on the large Kappa class. ;
She said that the severity of the |
i penalty was lessened by fact that j
probably neither girl had had a date ,
I since she had been in school.
Miss Hortense Horrowitz, who is ,
not so well known about the cam
pus, was expelled from school on
the same charge.
Lockouts Changed
Another resolution is to the effect
that lockout hours have been
changed from 10:30, 12, 1:150 and 2:30
o'clock to 8:30 o'clock. However,
i women who wish to go dancing in
San Francisco may stay out until 9
j o'clock if they have their parents'
i permission, are 21 years old, are go
i ing with their brother, and are clean
behind behind the ears.
A further stipulation was added
that there must be 20 Stanford
women in the same party and that
the party must all no in the same
car. (''That will fix 'em," chuckled
Mary, as she hopped a freight for
Washington.)

Another resolution is to the effect
that lockout hours have been
changed from 10:30, 12, 1:150 and 2:30
o'clock to 8:30 o'clock. However,
i women who wish to go dancing in
San Francisco may stay out until 9
j o'clock if they have their parents'
i permission, are 21 years old, are go
i ing with their brother, and are clean
behind behind the ears.
A further stipulation was added
that there must be 20 Stanford
women in the same party and that
the party must all no in the same
car. (''That will fix 'em," chuckled
Mary, as she hopped a freight for
Washington.)
