# T'HELL WID DE LOWER DIVISION!
## 
### 
Now llij.il llie Board of Trustees is marking lime on I lie
mallei 1 ol the Lower Division, il is about time that some
body looked al the mailer in the correct light. The Daily
feels that il is the proper nominee for that posl, so here
goes for some high-class looking.
Anybody with any sense can see that Ihe Lower Divi
sion is just a "waste ol time, and where do the freshmen and
sophom'ores think they get off, taking precedence over
whips Irom \ alley View Junior College and Miss Pea
body's Select School for Men ? It's a laugh on llie face of it.
Ol course, high school graduates with marvelous rec
ords are all right in their place, but it ought to be evident
that their place may be San Francisco I 'diversity, Univer
sity ot Southern California, and as a last resort, University
of California, but certainly not good old Leland Stanford.
Kb. fellows?
It must be pretty obvious to the Registrar's ottice thai
some of llie high school graduates who have IS and 19
recommendations and are four-sport men, won't make
very good research students, no matter how well they get
over their first four years. You can't expect the Registrar's
ollice lit put their O.K. on men like that, can you?
On the other hand, it must be equally as obvious to the
Registrar's ollice that two years at Fanny Hill Jaysee is
likely to qualify a fellow for almost anything, and there is
absolutely no reason in the world why a fellow with such
a background should be denied entrance to our dear Uni
versity, the Harvard of the Pacific Slope.
Anyway, fellows, il just won't do any good to squawk.
r i lie Lower Division is going to join the auk and the dodo
in the limbo of forgotten things, and Stanford will'lake her
recognized place in the educational sun as the leader of
the post-graduate junior college universities. Viva Sacra
mento. San Mateo and Marin!
