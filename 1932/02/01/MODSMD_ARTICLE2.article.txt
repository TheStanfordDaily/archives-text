Robert M. Brown Heft), famous boy scout, who learned all about
birds since he has been president of the A.S.S.U., is shown holding
the bird in hand. The bird was recently given the dramatic council
for their recent production. Bobby says he isn't going to take his
bird to Europe as he figures he will get lots of birds when he gets
over there.
