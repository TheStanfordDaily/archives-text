Now thai women's rushing is over, the Daily has this
opportunity to extend its congratulations to the various
sororities and lelieitale them on the splendid manner in
which they handled such a ticklish situation.
At some schools, a similar period becomes a mad hurly
hurlv that results in dirty politics, illegal rushing and
broken hearts, hut Pan-Hellenic, that group of left-handed
sopranos, took care of all that this year. Consequently, not
one house put up its usual cry of "Dirty Rushing," and
practically no hearts were broken.
At many universities, girls that don't go Row are re
garded with some disfavor socially. Therefore, they make
every effort to pledge a house, sometimes taking a pin they
don I particularly want just to escape social ignominy.
lint at Stanford, things are different. It's what you are,
not where you live, that counts, and only women out of
some 12.1 eligible to go Row announced their intentions of
doing so. And il is all due to Pan-Hellenic, which is just
about the finest bunch of upright girls you could possibly
imagine.
