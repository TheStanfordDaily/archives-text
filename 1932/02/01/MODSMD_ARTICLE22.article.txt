# SERIOUSLY, NOW-

\\ e hale lo spoil a paper w hose purpose is lo amuse j
with anything serious, but v v feel that some explanation!
should he made to a campus that might he very much sur
prised this morning.
Razz sheets, common occurrences at practically every
major university on the coast, have been, if not taboo, at
least Yrowned upon at Stanford. It was felt that the nature
and size ot the student body made razz sheets impracti
cable here. However, members of Sigma Delta Chi be-!
lieved that it was possible to print a razz sheet that was
amusing and still keep within the bounds of good taste.;
This morning's issue is the result.
Those members are too close lo the forest to see the >
trees, and lliey cannot tell whether or not their efforts have
been successful. At all events, lliey hope that the razzees
will realize that everything has been done in a spirit of
fun, without nfalieious intent. We how our heads.
