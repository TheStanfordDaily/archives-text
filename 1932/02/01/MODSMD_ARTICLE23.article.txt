## HOW ABOUT HOOVER?

Consider, if you will, the park |
bench in a serious light with no at
tempt at ostentatious display of
pseudo erudition and despite the
iact that a park bench under a tree
has never had the same prestige as
one comparatively—in—the clear, i
due to the presence of the little
leathered creatures or possibly the
Girl I Left Behind Me Bureau oi
the American Legion, which offers
a unique thHll.
The mauve decade of the park
bench has long since passed and j
now we have a problem which we ,
hope the college-trained will con- j
sider since they are going to lead 1
the nation some day—we hope.
Can the bench survive its period
of prosperity? Now it is the couch
of financiers, the resting-place of
Genius Out of a Job, and it in
bound to profit by the association,
but always considering the rear,
what of the future. What will the j
park bench hold for us? For you,
for me, for the Chinese, the League
of Nations, Roble Hall, or the Robin
that Sings (and more) in the j
Spring?
Millions and millions of figures
recumbent! Before we had the trarnp
and the bum (there being a subtle
distinction between the two) to of
fer what intellectual solace a park
bench could get during lean years,
but now the abiding place of the
very flower of our national brain
assets is upon this once lowly rest
ing place.
Trivia? Who can say trivia when ;
the Manchurian benches are being
demolished as the Japanese say
"Yes" and the Ohinese say "No,"
and the League of Nations has just
had heil week and can't sit down 1
very impressively?
We will now take a broad cross '
section of American National Ex
istence and pick on the delectable ]

] Clara Bow as an example of Ameri
; cana Effervescent. If gambling and j
the motion pictures are silly, then '
we are all tinged with the same
lurid shade and the blame rests j
with us and on 1,890,000 park I
benches throughout the land.
Imagination is what we need: a j
park bench, gigantic, all-embracing, j
stretching from Palo Alto and :
around the world and back again, |
a long, slim, 'beautiful arc, or j
should I say parabola?
But now comes the powerful arm i
| of the Interstate Commerce Com- I
j mission, which is as it should be. i
1 We must not be rah-rah at college, |
but by the same, token neither
should we inhibit all our chances
of being a successful sitter.
For college with its classrooms, j
stadia, and dining halls, is basically
just what our forefathers conceived j
it to be: the best practical prepara- I
tion for park-bench reclining, and
| if I were on a wet platform in 1932 i
I wo it Id be irritated, but if I were a j
dry 1 would sit tight on my old
bench, although the Democrats
can't si' tight if they are dry, yet!
Raskob says they might, and he has j
a sufficiency of coin of the realm'
-to back up his chance remarks. j
It is all pretty glorious if you will !
just sit down on a park bench and j
think. In the far-flung offices of the ,
Dollar Steamship Company perspi- !
cacity is still perspicacity and great j
men still'babble on topics of major |
importance.
It is hard to settle all the great
; problems of the world in one sitting.
Perhaps it should be subdivided and
we should do it half one day and
half the next, but then, capability
knows no .limit and the greedy
arms of the intelligentsia are grasp
, ing, grasping, grasping-
America has need of us, we must j
away, WE MUST AWAY.
