# THE 						WINDBLOWER

### 
Windblower is all fiittery — we
mean jittery (get it?) these daze
(get it?). What with repression
dances, basket brawl (get it?), the
Women's Sconsill, Lagunita, and Ed
Boils (get it?) it's just too easy to
Philip Space except once in a while
but—let's see, where were we, oh
yes, it was about the week-end,
which reminds us about the duck
iest little story about a freshman—
no it was a sophomore—no I think
it was a freshman, well anyway this
senior was taking a final examina
tion — no it was a midquarter —
lemme see —I guess it was a final,
well this junior was turning in his
term report when he remembered
that he had forgotten—no he forgot
that he remembered—where were
w?—oh yes, he had thought of the
—what is it?—oh yeah, the honor
mode—er, code (get it?) so took
his pen—or maybe it was a pencil,
and typed—lemme see whathahel
did he type? Isn't that embarrassing?
Oh yeah, he typed—what was it?
Oh, well.
That last story reminds us of an
other one. It seems there was a
freshman—no a sophomore—wait,
that's the one we just told. Oh well,
just a couple fo paragraphs bore—
we mean more (get it?) We don't
like it any more than you do,
schnitzle, and if ya don' like it keen
it under yat, see?) Where were we?
Oh, yes, poetry, now—
A night in June
A blue—l mean gold—moon
A time to spoon
A big balloon
A daffy loon

A golden ray
A moonlit—l mean sunlit—day
A little fay
A trifle gay
A—A—that way
A little sigh
A great, big cry
A wonder why
A (lemme think) lie
A—A—bye, bye.
To Bees

Buzz, bees, buzz,

Run, bees, run,
Run, run, bees—

•' " T
Bees, bees, sting,
Sting, bees, sting,
Sting, sting, bees—

rain keeps up (get it?).
