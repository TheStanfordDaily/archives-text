LADIES OF THE BIG HOUSE—

(You've already missed it, you
lucky people.)
This is supposed to be a
melodrama. But it is a tragedy, even
though the hero and heroine clinch
without danger of intervention in
the final scene. The tragedy occurs
late in the picture, when the peni

tentiary guards give a condemned |
man one pint of whiskey the day
before lie is to be executed.
Sylvia Sydney, she of the Japa- i
nese sandman smile, is a tearful, j
virtuous little flower girl, and the j
hero (whatever his name) is just a !
blond lily whom she picks up from !
the floral display window. They get j
framed by a gunman, whom we >
remember as a rotten comedian of j
some several seasons ago. The hero j
almost gets hanged. That's another '
tragedy.
Pretty bad, on the whole, al- j
though there are some interesting
ladies in the big house. —J.H.C.
THIRTEEN MEN — By Tiffany
Thayer. You won't give a damn
who published it. (Buy it any
place, if you are lucky.)
Thirteen men can cover a hell of
a lot of territory during their lives,
as you may be surprised and
shocked to discover when reading !
this orange-covered volume. We j
were too excited to notice the pub- !
Usher's name, but, whoever he is, he j
has cast his last year's straw hat |
into the circle, of "what every young j
girl, and boy too, should know" !
literature.
Our introduction to the book !
came by way of first-class mail, in !
a letter from a girl we threw over j

last summer, and who has since
probably joined the legion of the
love-starved. She wrote, ". . . nor
am I in a state of insobriety. But,
having just completed Tiffany
Thayer's "Thirteen Men," I am
more or less out of my mind." Of
course, we couldn't blame that en
tirely on what she'd been reading,
but anyway we hunted up the book
in a fraternity house and sat up
most of the night reading it.
We could reprint a whole chapter,
and you still wouldn't know what
it's all about. But we recommend
It. You may call it trash when
you've finished, but you'll read it
through, and with a minimum of
interruptions.

LADIES OF THE BIG HOUSE—

(You've already missed it, you
lucky people.)
This is supposed to be a
melodrama. But it is a tragedy, even
though the hero and heroine clinch
without danger of intervention in
the final scene. The tragedy occurs
late in the picture, when the peni

tentiary guards give a condemned |
man one pint of whiskey the day
before lie is to be executed.
Sylvia Sydney, she of the Japa- i
nese sandman smile, is a tearful, j
virtuous little flower girl, and the j
hero (whatever his name) is just a !
blond lily whom she picks up from !
the floral display window. They get j
framed by a gunman, whom we >
remember as a rotten comedian of j
some several seasons ago. The hero j
almost gets hanged. That's another '
tragedy.
Pretty bad, on the whole, al- j
though there are some interesting
ladies in the big house. —J.H.C.

Thirteen men can cover a hell of

this orange-covered volume. We j

literature.
Our introduction to the book !
came by way of first-class mail, in !
a letter from a girl we threw over j

last summer, and who has since
probably joined the legion of the
love-starved. She wrote, ". . . nor
am I in a state of insobriety. But,
having just completed Tiffany
Thayer's "Thirteen Men," I am
more or less out of my mind." Of
course, we couldn't blame that en
tirely on what she'd been reading,
but anyway we hunted up the book
in a fraternity house and sat up
most of the night reading it.
