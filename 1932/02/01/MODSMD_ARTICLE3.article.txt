# Helvenston Gives "Bird" To Baffled Spectators
## 
### 
Harold Helvenston, the old fox of j
dramatics, again pulled a new one
out of his bag of tricks in the pres- ;
entation of John Drunkater's (as i
after this play he is officially dead I
as far as dramatics go,'the past tense |
is more appropriate) "Boid in
Hand."
The trick was pulled on the hand- i
ful of cash customers in the last act.
Rumor has it that the small audi- [
ence was not due to lack of interest
in the performance but because only !
a limited number of tickets were j
sold in order to make room for all
the ushers.
Oh, yes, I started to tell you about'
Harold's joke. Along toward thej
end of the last act the stage was j
cleared of all superfluous characters I
and the hero and heroine leaped to
a clinch. The spectators rose think- j
ing the farce was over, but in i
popped a couple of actors and the
thing continued. Everyone sat down i
for a few moments only to rise again •
when it seemed certain that the cur
tains would be drawn. Again they
were disappointed. Time and again '
this occurred until, when at last i
jokester Helvenston called a halt, !
the audience was so tired it could
hardly stagger out of the assembly 1
hall. It was a great contest of pliys- j
ical endurance, folks, and the spec- ,
tators collapsed giving the husky 1
dramatic outfit a clean-cut victory, j
A new low was struck in the sec- j
ond act. A couple of minor charac- I
tors, Ruhland Isaly, the famous Chi- i
nese basketball player, and Virginia j
Wilson, whose shapely figure in a,
dressing gown nearly made the play |
a success, were gazing tenderly into 1
each other's eyes and the atmos- !
phere was tense with expectant pas- I
sion. Suddenly, as if urged by a
voice backstage, she leaped int(J his
arms and kissed him. The custom
ers, who had been leaning forward
in their seats eagerly awaiting a
great emotional portrayal, suddenly
slumped back as if hit in the face
with a bar towel. That kiss hacl all
the tender emotion coincident with

embracing a maiden aunt who has i
hal'tosis. It is impossible to believe !
that t.ny woman, even with stage |
fright, could be so frigid. If you J
don't stop i pressing yourself, Vir
ginia, you'll yourself a couple I
of inhibitions.

The comedy was r»->t without its
humorous moments, however, as
anyone could tell who wa. paying
close attention. Whenever a
line was spoken, the actors became
convulsed with laughter aAd the
performance was delayed while they
recovered their breath. At this mo
ment the ushers, who had been
coached beforehand, laughed loudly,
and the customers, aroused by the
noise, joined in to prove to their
neighbors that (hey had not really
been asleep. It must have taken
long and tedious direction to teach
the actors and ushers the proper
moment to register merriment.
The farce, though, had its mo
ments even for those who paid to
in. A couple of good laughs were
provided, once when a shade'on one
of the windows in the balcony flew
up making a lot of racket, and again
when someone fell down in the rear
of the assembly hall. It is unknown
whether these two choice bits were
included in the original script or not..
In conclusion I might point out to
the dramatic council that if it wishes
a review pointing out the good fea
tures of their performances, it had
better not give the Daily seats way
back in the dollar section.

that t.ny woman, even with stage |
fright, could be so frigid. If you J
don't stop i pressing yourself, Vir
ginia, you'll yourself a couple I
of inhibitions.

The comedy was r»->t without its
humorous moments, however, as
anyone could tell who wa. paying
close attention. Whenever a
line was spoken, the actors became
convulsed with laughter aAd the
performance was delayed while they
recovered their breath. At this mo
ment the ushers, who had been
coached beforehand, laughed loudly,
and the customers, aroused by the
noise, joined in to prove to their
neighbors that (hey had not really
been asleep. It must have taken
long and tedious direction to teach
the actors and ushers the proper
moment to register merriment.
The farce, though, had its mo
ments even for those who paid to
in. A couple of good laughs were
provided, once when a shade'on one
of the windows in the balcony flew
up making a lot of racket, and again
when someone fell down in the rear
of the assembly hall. It is unknown
whether these two choice bits were
included in the original script or not..
In conclusion I might point out to
the dramatic council that if it wishes
a review pointing out the good fea
tures of their performances, it had
better not give the Daily seats way
back in the dollar section.
Harold Helvenston, the old fox of j
dramatics, again pulled a new one
out of his bag of tricks in the pres- ;
entation of John Drunkater's (as i
after this play he is officially dead I

The trick was pulled on the hand- i
ful of cash customers in the last act.
Rumor has it that the small audi- [
ence was not due to lack of interest
in the performance but because only !
a limited number of tickets were j
sold in order to make room for all
the ushers.
Oh, yes, I started to tell you about'
Harold's joke. Along toward thej
end of the last act the stage was j
cleared of all superfluous characters I
and the hero and heroine leaped to
a clinch. The spectators rose think- j
ing the farce was over, but in i
popped a couple of actors and the
thing continued. Everyone sat down i
for a few moments only to rise again •
when it seemed certain that the cur
tains would be drawn. Again they
were disappointed. Time and again '
this occurred until, when at last i
jokester Helvenston called a halt, !
the audience was so tired it could
hardly stagger out of the assembly 1
hall. It was a great contest of pliys- j
ical endurance, folks, and the spec- ,
tators collapsed giving the husky 1
dramatic outfit a clean-cut victory, j
A new low was struck in the sec- j
ond act. A couple of minor charac- I
tors, Ruhland Isaly, the famous Chi- i
nese basketball player, and Virginia j
Wilson, whose shapely figure in a,
dressing gown nearly made the play |
a success, were gazing tenderly into 1
each other's eyes and the atmos- !
phere was tense with expectant pas- I
sion. Suddenly, as if urged by a
voice backstage, she leaped int(J his
arms and kissed him. The custom
ers, who had been leaning forward
in their seats eagerly awaiting a
great emotional portrayal, suddenly
slumped back as if hit in the face
with a bar towel. That kiss hacl all
the tender emotion coincident with

embracing a maiden aunt who has i
hal'tosis. It is impossible to believe !
