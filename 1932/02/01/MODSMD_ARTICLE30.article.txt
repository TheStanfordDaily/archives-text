THIS STRANGE CASE OF
LES lIABLES' INJURY
"WHERE THE hell's Hahlcs!"
snarled Dapper Dink Temple
ton, L«y wonder coach of the
Redsl.irlcd Stanford Indian cin
der path aggregation.
Now Dink, at the time, which
wis hist spring, about a week
before the track meet against
University of Southern Califor
nia at Los Angeles, was ajl
wrought up. In fact, he was j
talking in a loud voice and wav
ing it is left lunch hook in the
air vigorously, a procedure
which the average citizen might
figure comparatively no effort
whatsoever, hut which anybody
who has seen Dink at work will
vouch is no less than consider
able.
"HE'S MARRIED," answered John
"College" Lauritzen, who is familiar
ly known by the above nickname ,
on account of he looks and behaves i
so much like Joe. Now at this all
the truckmen who were gathered;
around sighed somewhat with relief (
and turned their eyes gratefully on |
uood old John. That is, except Les's j
brother Ike, whose bloodshot eye lit j
lith a veiy souUull look as he moved i
it with not a little trouble in the !
general direction of good old John.
But thai very good comeback of ;
John's, though it startled Dink quite
consdicrable, did not surprise the
boys. Good old John, always right
there with the right thing at the
l ight time.
NOW GOOD old John, who it
appears is even more of a card
when he gels in a frat house,
naturally figuring there was
nothing more to say, left the
group to show Ben Eastman how
to win foot races. Bob Jones
how to throw the discus, and
Nellie Gray how to toss the shot.
HOWEVER, DINK, who is ordi
narily considered a pretty smart
guy, could not seem to figure how j
Los Rubles being married had any- I
thing to do with him not being out
for practice, like all good track men j
should.
Considering Ike, obviously Les's i
brother, might know why Les was
at the present time elsewhere, Dink
pointed out this fact to the trem- '
bling Ike, who was then not yet |
captain of the team, for this was 1
last spring.
IKE THOUGHT for quite a
while before he said anything,
as well he might, for as it turns
out the think he had to explain
was very difficult indeed. And
when he did speak, he gargled
his words more than somewhat,
so embarrased was he.
"He vass on his vay to da con
jugal fireside ven I last laid da
peepers on him late last night, and
nutting vass wrong vit him den," ]
Ikey explained finally. "But da foist !
ting I see him in da morning he vass j
vaulking vit crutches. Somehow da .
knee vuss of joint trown oud."
Whereas the Boy Wonder
Coach of America is pacified, al
though at the time lie mourns
rot a little over losing such a
sprinter as Les from his track
team for a while, as is the habit
of an\ good coach of the land
when virile young star is hurt '
more than somewhat.

THIS STRANGE CASE OF
LES lIABLES' INJURY
"WHERE THE hell's Hahlcs!"
snarled Dapper Dink Temple
ton, L«y wonder coach of the
Redsl.irlcd Stanford Indian cin
der path aggregation.
Now Dink, at the time, which
wis hist spring, about a week
before the track meet against
University of Southern Califor
nia at Los Angeles, was ajl
wrought up. In fact, he was j
talking in a loud voice and wav
ing it is left lunch hook in the
air vigorously, a procedure
which the average citizen might
figure comparatively no effort
whatsoever, hut which anybody
who has seen Dink at work will
vouch is no less than consider
able.
"HE'S MARRIED," answered John
"College" Lauritzen, who is familiar
ly known by the above nickname ,
on account of he looks and behaves i
so much like Joe. Now at this all
the truckmen who were gathered;
around sighed somewhat with relief (
and turned their eyes gratefully on |
uood old John. That is, except Les's j
brother Ike, whose bloodshot eye lit j
lith a veiy souUull look as he moved i
it with not a little trouble in the !
general direction of good old John.
But thai very good comeback of ;
John's, though it startled Dink quite
consdicrable, did not surprise the
boys. Good old John, always right
there with the right thing at the
l ight time.
NOW GOOD old John, who it
appears is even more of a card
when he gels in a frat house,
naturally figuring there was
nothing more to say, left the
group to show Ben Eastman how
to win foot races. Bob Jones
how to throw the discus, and
Nellie Gray how to toss the shot.
HOWEVER, DINK, who is ordi
narily considered a pretty smart
guy, could not seem to figure how j
Los Rubles being married had any- I
thing to do with him not being out
for practice, like all good track men j
should.
Considering Ike, obviously Les's i
brother, might know why Les was
at the present time elsewhere, Dink
pointed out this fact to the trem- '
bling Ike, who was then not yet |
captain of the team, for this was 1
last spring.
IKE THOUGHT for quite a
while before he said anything,
as well he might, for as it turns
out the think he had to explain
was very difficult indeed. And
when he did speak, he gargled
his words more than somewhat,
so embarrased was he.
"He vass on his vay to da con
