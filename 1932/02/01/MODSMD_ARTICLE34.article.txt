With the report of the results of
the sixth revote for major student
body offices comes the announce
ment by the election committee of
the schedule (tentative) for the
spring weekly revote series, ending
with the Big Revote with California
on April 5.
The sixth revote shows a clear
gain of one vote for each candidate
for the highest office, which the
election committee notes as a sig
nificant forward step. The commit
tee, in its current announcement,
prides iiself on the number of suc
cessful revotes it has conducted so
far.
"No previous election committee
has ever held more than three or
four successive revotes. We have
every prospect of another ten, cli
maxing in the grand Big Revote
with U.C."
The seventh revote, scheduled for
tomorrow, will feature a dramatic
contest for the A.S.S.U. presidency,
and a stiff battle between Robert
ErOwn for the vice-presidency. The
secretary contest is not expected to
be decisive, according to the election
committee.
Although none of the candidates
are expected to be registered next
fall, all of them have declared their
willingness to be shouldei'ed with
campus honors.

meeting of the rally and election
