# SNOPPYQUOP THE GREAT
## Former Great Indian Athlete Carries on Remarkable Feats of Strength Still; Now Big Family Man 
### Pouquppons, '32 
One of the greatest basketball j
players of all time was the mighty
man, Snoppyquop, who left Stan
ford in 1916, after three years of j
triumphant ensaba-tossing. Basket
ball was just one of the sports in j
which Snop was pre-eminent dur
ing his undergraduate years. He;
first attracted notice in 1914, when |
Chaparral, ever on the lookout for j
promising material, introduced him j
to a wider circles of friends than;
lie hnd known in Encina.
This introduction, as Artist Feg j
Murray, 'IG, remembers it, is;
graphic illy depicted in the alle-;
gorical drawing above. Snoppyquop ;
is: here resting both brain and j
brawn, thumbing his whimsical nose;

at a group of admiring students. No
tice the rapturous admiration on the
member of the 500 caught by the
artist's facile pen.
Snop, in his time, pulled more ;
football, baseball, and basketball j
games out of the fire for Stanford j
than any other player. He fre- t
quently held the opposing basketball I
guards singlehanded, and on more j
than one occasion played both 1
pitcher and catcher simultaneously j
in crucial diamond series.
Retired now to private life, Snop- j
pyquop runs a gymnasium in Holly- j
wood, where his feats of strength !
attract throngs. He has 35 children, j
all of whom bear marked resem- |
blance to their father, and inherit!
his prominent features.
