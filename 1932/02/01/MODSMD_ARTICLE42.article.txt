# PZULCH'S BASKET AFTER GUN FAILS TO DOWN BRUINS
## Barry Today Reported Yet In Pavilion, Waving Arms, Grimacing 
### Oscar Zulch 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31. (Exclu
sive) —Whipping in a long one
armed '"wonder-shot" from ihe
southwest corner of the other end
of the floor one and one-quarter
seconds (eastern standard time) af
ter the final gun had popped, Oscar
Zulch, diminutive blond-haired
youngster whose whirlwind play
this season has given him the title
of "Hot Shot" Zulch, failed by 25
points to tie up the score for Stan
lord against the Bruins down South
both yesterday and the day before.
Immediately after the game, th.e
Bruin fans, so dazzled by the won
der work of "Hot Shot" that they
forgot who won the game, officially
protested both the officiating and
the "stalling" brand of play em
ployed by Zulch and his mates.
Barry Bothered
Sam Barry, who was in the
stands; added to the confusion by
refusing to leave the pavilion, re
maining to rise and wave his lunch
hooks, sat down to wrimace furious
ly, rise and wave his lunch hooks
again, and repeat the procedure far
into the night in protest of the hor
rible officiating.
As to the stall. Zulch was charged
with holding the ball for an hour
and a half without passing. Zulch,
however, claimed that the fans had
actually profited by the long inter
mission, since he had personally
taken it upon his shoulders to en
tertain them.
Being a supreme pianist, Zulch,
with his ever-ready presence of
mind, hid the basketball so that the
Bruins would not find it, pulled a
baby grand piano out of a small
pocket in his basketball pants, and
struck tip the strains of "Come Join
the Band," following quickly with
"Bettv Co-ed," "Chloe," and "Yes
Sir, She's My Baby."
Dunn Quotes Rules
Mr. Bill Dunn, refereeing the con
test, failed to uphold the protest on
ihe grounds that since the basket
ball was hidden anyway, it was
perfectly legal that Zulch entertaain
the crowd with this heart-rending
medley.
Dunn also emphatically declared
that he would use his official power
to see that victory was credited to
the Bruins, since it was obvious that
they had scored the most points, and
that that, as he remembered, was
clearly covered in ihe official rule
book as, constituting victory.
The loss put Stanford in the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar,
which some say is a very good
cellar indeed, a fact which seems
pretty well proven by the Indians'
reluctance to leave it. Redskins have
always been hot for fire-water.

lord against the Bruins down South
both yesterday and the day before.
Immediately after the game, th.e
Bruin fans, so dazzled by the won
der work of "Hot Shot" that they
forgot who won the game, officially
protested both the officiating and
the "stalling" brand of play em
ployed by Zulch and his mates.
Barry Bothered
Sam Barry, who was in the
stands; added to the confusion by
refusing to leave the pavilion, re
maining to rise and wave his lunch
hooks, sat down to wrimace furious
ly, rise and wave his lunch hooks
again, and repeat the procedure far
into the night in protest of the hor
rible officiating.
As to the stall. Zulch was charged
with holding the ball for an hour
and a half without passing. Zulch,
however, claimed that the fans had
actually profited by the long inter
mission, since he had personally
taken it upon his shoulders to en
tertain them.
Being a supreme pianist, Zulch,
with his ever-ready presence of
mind, hid the basketball so that the
Bruins would not find it, pulled a
baby grand piano out of a small
pocket in his basketball pants, and
struck tip the strains of "Come Join
the Band," following quickly with
"Bettv Co-ed," "Chloe," and "Yes
Sir, She's My Baby."
Dunn Quotes Rules
Mr. Bill Dunn, refereeing the con
test, failed to uphold the protest on
ihe grounds that since the basket
ball was hidden anyway, it was
perfectly legal that Zulch entertaain
the crowd with this heart-rending
medley.
Dunn also emphatically declared
that he would use his official power
to see that victory was credited to
the Bruins, since it was obvious that
they had scored the most points, and
that that, as he remembered, was
clearly covered in ihe official rule
book as, constituting victory.
The loss put Stanford in the
Pacific Coast Conference cellar,
which some say is a very good
cellar indeed, a fact which seems
pretty well proven by the Indians'
reluctance to leave it. Redskins have
always been hot for fire-water.
