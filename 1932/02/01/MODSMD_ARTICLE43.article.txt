# FOILS TEAM PRAISED BY "BUGYMAN" BOGGE
## 
### 
Mr. Elwyn "Bogyman" Bugge
yesterday announced that prospects
for the coming fencing season are
exceptionally rosy.
Just when the first meet will take
place is uncertain, though Bugge is
now whipping his squad in shape
for operations which will be begun
shortly to fence Toyon flail in an
ticipation of another raid by strange
women.
