1 elected captain of the Chinese Club
intramural basketball team.
If any of you muggs wish to see
I him, young Ruhland may be seen
| driving about the campus in his
; employer's automobile, which is a
i large and very racy Auburn.
Funk Woo, diminutive dynamo
i forward for the Chinese, was beaten
j out in the election by Ruhland
I mainly because of Isaly's edge in
i height, reach, and all-around ring
; ability.

! with a very quick left jab, while
1 Funk Woo stands a mere 3 feet 4
inches in his stocking feet and 3
J feet even with his shoes on, and
