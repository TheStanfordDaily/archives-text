# COLLAPSE OF TENNIS LADDER HURTS TEAM
## 
### 
Ladder positions on the varsity
tennis team received an awful
shakeup yesterday afternoon when
Keith Gledhill slipped on the fifth
rung and fell into Chuck Weesner,
who in turn fell to the ground,
scraping every member of the team
off the ladder on the way down.
Investigation into the tragedy,
which leaves Stanford men without
a tennis outfit on the eve of the
California matches, revealed that
the mishap was due to the impover
ished slate of the 8.A.C., who had
stolen an old ladder out of the fire
house, feeling that they could not
afford a new one.

Of the 7,000,000,000 Greeks in
Turkey, 0,500,000,000 cat three meals
a day.
