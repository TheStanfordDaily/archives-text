## Johnson Strikes Out With Hassocks Bulging At Hotel Hopkins 
### Sidney Burp 
McSwab, diminutive one-armed
left fielder, began and ended his dia
mond career in a blaze of glory
Saturday, scoring the only 1 lit and
only run in the annual Stanford-
Olympic Club bat crossing contest.
McSwab it was who came to bat
in the last half of the ninth canto.
Everybody else had already batted
and gone out and were lying around
on the floor of the Kappa Sig House.
McSwab waited around at the plate
for a low ball, took a cut, dropped
his bat, and limped io first. He took
a big lead off the base, stealing sec
ond clumsily. McSwab made third,
barely scraping his way safely, then
dragged his weary legs homeward,
stopping on the line to light a pipe
and tossing his match defiantly to
ward the mound.
McSwab whistled as he crossed
the platter, picked up his dirt
scraper, and went over to work on
the soccer field.
The day being I'ainy, and the
game having been postponed, Rin
tala, Delmas, Johnson, Philippi,
Campbell, and the other Indian big
shots were given rain tickets, or
pass-out checks, which they used
at the Mark that night.
