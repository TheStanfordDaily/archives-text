# STAR FORWARD KIDNAPPED BY IRATE SISTERS
## Sorority Heads Make Hoop Luminary Walk Home On Injured Leg 
### 
A wild tale of kidnapping, high- .
powered rushing, and forced deten- j
tion of one of Stanford's best has- |
ketball forwards was l'evealed to- j
day and with it, the true reason j
why Tiger Tom Cordry did not play i
in the first game of the Big Series j
with the University of California.
Cordry, be it known, was engaged j
in the gentle pursuit of selling ;
Kappa Kappa Gamma to a certain j
freshman wench during the past ;
blood and tears session. The certain j
freshman was wanted badly by Pi 1
Beta Phi.
Now, at the time, Cordry was just
getting over the leg injury first sus- 1
tained in the U.C.L.A. series and ;
aggravated in the U.S.C. games. The j
hurt was.' healing, however, and
Wildcat Tom was getting ready to
start against California when Pi
Beta Phi decided upon a course of
action.
Accordingly, a group of Pi Phi's
dripped honeyed words in the un
suspecting athlete's ear and cajoled
him into going with them for a ride
in their great big automobile. What j
was Angora Tom's great surprise,
I when the dear girls proceeded to !
drive him far into the hills back of
; the campus.
"Now," said the ringleader of the
1 hardy gang, "either you rush this
i young lady Pi Beta Phi, resigning i
; your efforts to send her Kappa way, |
! or you walk back to the campus, |
bun. leg and all."
Maltese Tom was thereby con
j fronted w'th a choice between duty
and honor. He hesitated for just a
moment, then declared proudly, "I ,
i would gladly die fir dear old Kappa :
i Kappa Gamma!"
"Die then, varlet!" hissed the Pi
Phi chieftain, and Tom damn near
! did before he got back to the cam
pus wilh his aching leg. To play
I against California was out of the
: question, and so the Redshirts went
down to defeat in a game where
Jaguar Tom's presence might have
meant a different story.
However, the Kappas got the
I wench.
' Eds. Note: Betts Hawkins loudly
protests that Little Tommy was, is,
and always will be a faithful Pi Phi
man. You can take it or leave it.

A wild tale of kidnapping, high- .

tion of one of Stanford's best has- |
ketball forwards was l'evealed to- j
day and with it, the true reason j
why Tiger Tom Cordry did not play i
in the first game of the Big Series j
with the University of California.
Cordry, be it known, was engaged j
in the gentle pursuit of selling ;
Kappa Kappa Gamma to a certain j
freshman wench during the past ;
blood and tears session. The certain j
freshman was wanted badly by Pi 1
Beta Phi.
Now, at the time, Cordry was just
getting over the leg injury first sus- 1
tained in the U.C.L.A. series and ;
aggravated in the U.S.C. games. The j
hurt was.' healing, however, and
Wildcat Tom was getting ready to
start against California when Pi
Beta Phi decided upon a course of
action.
Accordingly, a group of Pi Phi's
dripped honeyed words in the un
suspecting athlete's ear and cajoled
him into going with them for a ride
in their great big automobile. What j
was Angora Tom's great surprise,
I when the dear girls proceeded to !
drive him far into the hills back of
; the campus.
"Now," said the ringleader of the
1 hardy gang, "either you rush this
i young lady Pi Beta Phi, resigning i
; your efforts to send her Kappa way, |
! or you walk back to the campus, |
bun. leg and all."
Maltese Tom was thereby con
j fronted w'th a choice between duty
and honor. He hesitated for just a
moment, then declared proudly, "I ,
i would gladly die fir dear old Kappa :
i Kappa Gamma!"
"Die then, varlet!" hissed the Pi
Phi chieftain, and Tom damn near
! did before he got back to the cam
pus wilh his aching leg. To play
I against California was out of the
: question, and so the Redshirts went
down to defeat in a game where
Jaguar Tom's presence might have
meant a different story.
