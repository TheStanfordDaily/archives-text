# CHIEF DUGAN RINGS ALARM AS STATION BURNS TO GROUND
## Fireman Burned by Flames, Apparatus Truck Goes Up in Smoke 
### 
The Stanford fire house was com
pletely demolished by flames at a
lute hour last night. All the firemen
escaped without injury except
Adolph Schmooke, crack hosemari of
station No. 1, who was badly burned
about the face.
Schmooke, who is noted for his
calmness in the presence of danger,
was aroused by the screams of the
frantic firemen and leaped from his
bed. While pulling on his pants, he
attempted to light a cigarette and
awkwardly set his beard on fire.
Physicians say he may recover.
Fire Chief Dugan was passing the
fire house about 12 o'clock when he
noticed the flames shooting out of
the chemical tanks. He hurried
down to the corner of LaSwain and
turned in the alarm.
The firemen, barely escaping with
their lives, were unable to check the
flames and mingled with the large
crowd of spectators to admire the
conflagration.
Chief Dugan said that the de
struction of the station was no loss
to the university and that it would
not be rebuilt.
