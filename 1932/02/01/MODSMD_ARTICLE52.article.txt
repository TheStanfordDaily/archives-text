# GRAND GIFT GIVEN S.U. BY GENEROUS GIFTED ANOYMOUS
## 
### 
Word was received by the Daily
late last night of an anonymous gift
to the University of $8,435,753.22, to
be used by the University authori
ties in any way they see fit. Acting
President Bob Swain, when ques
tioned on the matter, declared that
the generous donor of the fine gift
had requested that his name be
withheld, for political reasons, since
maybe the Democrats wouldn't like
such an underhanded method of
getting the Stanford vote.
The Board of Athletic Control has
already decided just where the
money i.s to go, it having been de
cided at a meeting last night to put
â– a roof over Lagunita.
The donor of the fine gift made
only one reservation, Bob declared,
in his shy way. The students of the
University must raise $57,893,449.08
before next Saturday. It is expected
that this will be a mere formality,
judging from the hope expressed on
111 sides late yesterday.
