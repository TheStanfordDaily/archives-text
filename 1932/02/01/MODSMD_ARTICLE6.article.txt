# "Butch" Roth Discloses Whimsical Inner Self
## 
### 
Dr. E. Frederick Roth, assistant
medical adviser of men, settled back
in his chair and, taking his cigar
from his mouth, spat at a large spit
toon across the room, missing it by
a yard. "Yesterday I hit it twice,"
he said proudly, putting his feet on
his desk.
Doc Roth, who is known as
"Butch" to his friend, is not to be
confused with Salmon E. Roth, pres
ident of the Los Altos Kiwanis Club.
"So you want to know about some
interesting cases that I've treated
while at Stanford, eh? Well, here's
one that's always given me a good
laugh every time I think about it. A
fellow had put his foot through a
window and cut it badly—his foot,
I mean, not the window, ha, ha.
"I gave his foot a quick glance and
decided to sow it up. I can always
tell just by looking at a patient for
a minute what's the matter with
him. Some (if these doctors waste' a
lot of time in thorough examina
tions. I guess I've got a sixth sense
or something.
"Anyway," continued Butch, "1
sewed up his foot and a couple ol
days later it was all swelled up and
sort of blue lookinL'. I wanted to

I amputate right away but this fellow
' went to see some quack in the city, |
, who opened up the cut and found a j
big chunk of glass in it. His foot
j healed perfectly so I didn't get to
: amputate.
"Another fellow came in to see !
| mo who said his arm was broken. I j
could tell right away that it was ,
| nothing but a sprain so I tied some >
I bandages around it and told him to !
j come back in a few days. When he !
, returned, his arm was as crooked i
las my brother Al, ha, ha. I wanted j
jto amputate at once but the kid ,
[ went to a quack in San Francisco |
who reset his arm. That healed all j
right, too, so I missed out on an
other good amputation. That was
a good joke on the kid, my thinking !
I his broken arm was only sprained, j
| wasn't it?
"The other day a fellow came in !
' who thought he had a bad cold. I i
i could tell at a glance that it was j
| appendicitis and operated on him at ;
i once. The joke was on me that time j
for his appendix was perfectly sound
and healthy. He'll survive the oper- |
ation, though, if gangrene doesn't ;
set in. However, he won't be able j
to compete in athletics for a long
time. He was a good track man, too.
Amusing case, don't you think?"
Butch leaned back and laughed
loudly.
"So you want to know how I've
kept this job so long, eh?" asked
Butch, picking his fingernails with a
scalpel. "Well, my friend, not all
the rackets are in Chicago."

interesting cases that I've treated
while at Stanford, eh? Well, here's
one that's always given me a good
laugh every time I think about it. A
fellow had put his foot through a
window and cut it badly—his foot,
I mean, not the window, ha, ha.
"I gave his foot a quick glance and
decided to sow it up. I can always
tell just by looking at a patient for
a minute what's the matter with
him. Some (if these doctors waste' a
lot of time in thorough examina
tions. I guess I've got a sixth sense
or something.
"Anyway," continued Butch, "1
sewed up his foot and a couple ol
days later it was all swelled up and
sort of blue lookinL'. I wanted to

I amputate right away but this fellow
' went to see some quack in the city, |
, who opened up the cut and found a j
big chunk of glass in it. His foot
j healed perfectly so I didn't get to
: amputate.
"Another fellow came in to see !
| mo who said his arm was broken. I j
could tell right away that it was ,
| nothing but a sprain so I tied some >
I bandages around it and told him to !
j come back in a few days. When he !
, returned, his arm was as crooked i
las my brother Al, ha, ha. I wanted j
jto amputate at once but the kid ,
[ went to a quack in San Francisco |
who reset his arm. That healed all j
right, too, so I missed out on an
other good amputation. That was
a good joke on the kid, my thinking !
I his broken arm was only sprained, j
| wasn't it?
"The other day a fellow came in !
' who thought he had a bad cold. I i
i could tell at a glance that it was j
| appendicitis and operated on him at ;
i once. The joke was on me that time j
for his appendix was perfectly sound
and healthy. He'll survive the oper- |
ation, though, if gangrene doesn't ;
set in. However, he won't be able j
to compete in athletics for a long
time. He was a good track man, too.
Amusing case, don't you think?"
Butch leaned back and laughed
loudly.
"So you want to know how I've
kept this job so long, eh?" asked
Butch, picking his fingernails with a
scalpel. "Well, my friend, not all
the rackets are in Chicago."
