# HAND DROOLS IN DRIZZLE; DRENCHED FROSH CHEER HONOR SYSTEM DRIVEL
## 
### 
Standing in the Encina bullpen in
a drizzling rain, with torches held
aloft, a mob of frenzied freshmen
last night heard and endorsed the
address of Milton "Red" Hand on
the honor system at Stanford, what
it is, and what should be done
about it.
Hand, fiery political leader, and
guard or tackle, or something, on
the football varsity, rose to hitherto
unattained heights in speaking of
his chosen standard, and the hun
dred or so freshmen assembled
cheered his every remark.
An Institution
''The honor system is an institu
tion," Hand declared. "It has been
an institution at Stanford since—
for a long, long time.
Hand then went on to explain
why the honor system is a good
thing.
"The honor system is a good
thing,' he stated. "The honor sys

[ tem is more than an institution—it |
is a good institution. We have had j
j this institution for a long time here j
at Stanford, and we should keep it
| because.it is a good one."
States Plan
Hand restated his plan for enforc
ing the honor system, which he has j
i been giving such widespread pub- I
j licity recently.
I "The success or failure of the
j honor system depends on you," he I
j harangued the freshmen. "If every 1
, man will just do his part by ob- i
| serving the honor system, then we 1
: need not worry about methods of
■ enforcing it. Then the honor system j
; will be a success, and Stanford will
; retain her honor system institution,
: which is a good one."
At the conclusion of Hand's speech
\ the crowd gave rousing cheers for
Hand and for the honor system and
| indulged in general all - around
handshaking in token of their agree
j ment with Hand's plan.
