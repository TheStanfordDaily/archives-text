Plans were under way late today
for the staging of Stanford Univer

scrapping Indian team some wet, ,
rainy afternoon this week.
This announcement from Rally
headquarters was made by Edgar
Boyles, Rally Committee chairman,
who urged that the student body \
get behind the monkey movement, j
''This is a good idea and it is up ■
to use to show the team that we |
know they are a fighting, scrapping
team," said Boyles.
'"It is planned to have flagpoles
installed for the monkeys to wrap
their tails around," Boyles con
tinued. "We will have members of i
Sculpers, sophomore men's honor j
society, stand guards with pitchforks !
in case the monkey, which we af
fectionally call Bozo, should get '■
away."
"It is planned to have members of
the Rally Committee dressed in
hashers' uniforms and posing as '
white wings on guard at. all the i
entrances to the Memorial Library
depot steps, in case Bozo should get .
away,' said Boyles.
"This rally is a good idea and we
should get behind the movement and
support it," Boyles declared.
