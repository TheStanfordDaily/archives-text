# CHESS MANAGERS
## 
### 
All freshmen and sophomores who
would like to try out for manager
of the chess team report to Angelo
May in the lobby of the Old Union
tonight. Although this announce
ment has dun every day for the past
two weeks, no one has shown up
yet and Angelo says he is damned
tired of waiting in the Union lobby.

Students in Siberia are sometime
nowbound and miss their classes.
