# UNTRUE! UNTRUE!

### 
Statements contained in stories in this issue of
Tin: Stamoisi) Daily are not based upon fact.
To 1 lie intelligent campus reader, this notice will
appear superfluous; to some, including the editors of
San Francisco newspapers, the mention of the names
of actual campus personages may seem to stamp the
statements in today's Daily as sterling truth.
Have none of that! Remember: the stories ami
the stal emenl s then contain, are fictitious, inspired by
imagination rather than fact.
