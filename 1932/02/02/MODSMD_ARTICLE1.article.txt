# HAND ATTACKS FACULTY HONOR CODE POSITION
## Says Members Responsible For Trying To Uphold Basic Principles CLAIMS OFTEN DERISIVE Administration Also Comes In For Berating 
### 
Lashing out at faculty members
who fail to co-operate with Men's
Council on Honor Code principles
and administration, Milton Hand,
crusading Council chairman, last
night denounced dilatory and nega
tive tactics which he said charac
terize the attitude of a large num
ber of professors toward the Honor
Code.
"During the series of meetings
which the Council has been hold
ing since October with groups of
students," Hand said, ''we have en
countered a great deal of objection
to the way many faculty members
are handling their end of the Honor
Code situation. The basic complaint
concerns both the lack of positive
encouragement of the principles of
the Code and the negative attitude
which condemns the entire Code.
"One of the objections lias been
voiced toward professors who want
the honor pledge written on the
bluebook before the examination
starts, rather than afterward.
"Professors who wisecrack about
the Code are often criticized. Stu
dents tell us that they feel that such
professors are entirely lacking in
the spirit necessary to the success
of the Code. We. too, feel that fac
ulty members must get into the
spirit and swing of the Code just
as much as the students themselves.
It is certain that few of them are
now doing this.
"Disregard of the honor pledge by
professors automatically, even if
perhaps unconsciously on their part,
increases student disrespect for the
Code and is an encouragement for
students to break it."
The administration came in for i
its share of unfavorable comment. |
"The existing statements printed on
the blucbooks are ridiculous," Hand
said. "The reminder that the Honor
Code is in force at Stanford is rea
sonable enough, but it is certainly
not constructive. The other part of
the statement, however, the ad
monition to 'take alternate seats,' is
a mistake. It is poor psychology, and
gives students unconsciously a feel
ing of resistance to the Code."
Reverting to the faculty again,
Hand said, "Instructors who stay in
classes, as several are doing at the
present time, constitute one of the
most obvious factors in breaking
down respect for the Code that is
possible to conceive."

sonable enough, but it is certainly
not constructive. The other part of
the statement, however, the ad
monition to 'take alternate seats,' is
a mistake. It is poor psychology, and
gives students unconsciously a feel
ing of resistance to the Code."
Reverting to the faculty again,
Hand said, "Instructors who stay in
classes, as several are doing at the
present time, constitute one of the
most obvious factors in breaking
down respect for the Code that is
possible to conceive."
Lashing out at faculty members
who fail to co-operate with Men's
Council on Honor Code principles
and administration, Milton Hand,
crusading Council chairman, last
night denounced dilatory and nega
tive tactics which he said charac
terize the attitude of a large num
ber of professors toward the Honor
Code.
"During the series of meetings
which the Council has been hold
ing since October with groups of
students," Hand said, ''we have en
countered a great deal of objection
to the way many faculty members
are handling their end of the Honor
Code situation. The basic complaint
concerns both the lack of positive
encouragement of the principles of
the Code and the negative attitude
which condemns the entire Code.
"One of the objections lias been
voiced toward professors who want
the honor pledge written on the
bluebook before the examination
starts, rather than afterward.
"Professors who wisecrack about
the Code are often criticized. Stu
dents tell us that they feel that such
professors are entirely lacking in
the spirit necessary to the success
of the Code. We. too, feel that fac
ulty members must get into the
spirit and swing of the Code just
as much as the students themselves.
It is certain that few of them are
now doing this.
"Disregard of the honor pledge by
professors automatically, even if
perhaps unconsciously on their part,
increases student disrespect for the
Code and is an encouragement for
students to break it."
The administration came in for i
its share of unfavorable comment. |
"The existing statements printed on
the blucbooks are ridiculous," Hand
said. "The reminder that the Honor
Code is in force at Stanford is rea
sonable enough, but it is certainly
not constructive. The other part of
the statement, however, the ad
monition to 'take alternate seats,' is
a mistake. It is poor psychology, and
gives students unconsciously a feel
ing of resistance to the Code."
Reverting to the faculty again,
Hand said, "Instructors who stay in
classes, as several are doing at the
present time, constitute one of the
most obvious factors in breaking
down respect for the Code that is
possible to conceive."
