# GRADUATE BUSINESS SCHOOL HEARS TALK ON PUBLIC UTILITIES
## 
### 
Samuel Eastman, president of the
: Atlas Diesel Engine and Golden
j Gate Ferry companies, addressed
j the weekly meeting of the Gradu
j ate Business School held last night
I in the Union dining room.
Eastman spoke of the organiza
tion and duties of the public utili
ties in relation to matters of "ser
vice" and "finance" which he con
sidered to be of prime importance.
"The character of a company de
pends on the management, direc
torate, and personnel, and upon
these three depends the reputation
which it does or does not build up.
Before such an organization should
j attempt to become recognized
through the medium of advertising,
it should definitely have something
I to sell.
i In concluding, Eastman stated that
jÂ»he was not opposed to the construc-
I tion of a Golden Gate bridge, but
j that "a sincere and public-minded
1 group of engineers with a minimum
of selfish interest is the only pos
sible solution for a successful un
dertaking in a project of this na
i ture."
The opportunities afforded by the
Stanford Business School were
| commended by Eastman. Donald
j Eastman chairman, introduced the
j speaker of the evening.
