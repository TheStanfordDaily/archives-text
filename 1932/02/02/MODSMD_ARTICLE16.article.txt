## Thompson Talks On Studies Finished Last Year 
### 
Dr. Walter Thompson, associate
professor of Political Science, will
speak in the Assembly Hall at 7:30
o'clock this evening on "The Swed
ish System of Liquor Control." The
lecture was arranged as one of the
regular Tuesday evening series by
the Public Exercises Committee.
Dr. Thompson has made a com
plete survey of the situation in
Sweden, having lived there from
March to December of last year. He
will outline the organization and
principles of the Bratt System, which
i& the Swedish method of liquor
control.
Unique System
The system founded by Dr. Bratt
is rather peculiar, according to Dr.
Thompson. Each person is given an
allotment averaging four liters of
liquor a month. Extra amounts may
be demanded when guests are ex
pected or in the holiday season. In
addition to these stipends for home
use, the individual may purchase
two or three glasses of liquor with
tach meal bought at a restaurant.
The returned investigator says
that there are no bars in Sweden,
and that bootlegging and moonshin
ing are not problems. Only the citi
zens who are under twenty-three
years of age, and thus cannot get
government permits to buy liquor,
patronize the illegal dealers.
Dr. Thompson says that the peo
ple of Sweden are fairly well satis
fied with their liquor control, but
that no liquor system can satisfy
everybody. The Bratt System is the
result of eighty years' experiments
and a lifetime of investigation on
the part, of Dr. Bratt.
