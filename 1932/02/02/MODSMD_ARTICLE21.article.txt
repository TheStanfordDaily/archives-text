NANKING, Feb. 1. (A') —Japanese
guns spoke in a new place today.
The forts at Nanking, seat of the
Government of China until it was
moved last Sunday to the protec
tion of the interior, were shelled by
three Japanese ships of war lying
in the Yangtze river.
Thousands of x*efugees from the
Nanking waterfront streamed
through the black of night to less
exposed portions of the city.
A force of Japanese was landed
under cover of the bombardment.
They encountered fresh Chinese
troops barricaded behind sandbags,
and there was a brisk exchange of
machine gun fire.
The United States destroyer
Simpson, on duty off Nanking to
protect the 200 American residents,
was forced to shift its berth to get
out of the line of Japanese gunfire.
Washington dispatches indicated
the evacuation of Americans in
Chinese danger zones might begin
soon.
Hundreds of miles away from the
center of the Sino-Japanese con
flict, the Chinese coastal cities of
Suatow, Amoy, and Chefoo were
threatened with violence, and alarm
was felt for the safety of foreigners.
American destroyers will go at once
wherever they are needed to pro
tect United States citizens.
