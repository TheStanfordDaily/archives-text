# BUNN CHANGES CARDINAL HOOP SQUAD LINEUP
## Five Cleverest Men Are Concentrated In One Team By Change LACOMBE MADE GUARD Squad Pointed For Two U.S.C. Games 
### Lowell Cox 
Stanfoid's highest powered scor
j ing gun. l - may be concentrated on
I the Southern California basket Fri
j day and Saturday nights.
In an effort to inject more scor
ing punch into the lineup which
1 will face the Trojans in the South
land this week-end, Coach John
Bunn yesterday shifted "Frenchy"
LaCombe to guard, inserting Reggie
Meade at his vacated forward posi
tion.
The former Menlo star worked at
the new post during a lengthy
practice session yesterday, and will
remain there for another day or two
, at least. Whether the change will be
! permanent or not remains to bo
{ seen.
Lineup Changed
While he worked with smooth
ness on offense, LaCombe didn't
function so well on defense. If he
shows improvement in this depart
; ment in the next day or two, it is
! entirely possible that when the In
-1 dians take the floor against the
Trojans they will present a lineup
i like this: Meade and Cordry, for
j wards: Doub, center; LaCombe and
Norgard, guards.
This would concentrate five of the
cleverest men on the squad in the
i game at the same time, and would
| be as powerful a scoring combina
| tion as Bunn could muster.
Much Depends on Mcado
Much will depend on the condi
tion of Meade, who has been ham
pered all season by illness. It would
i be necessary for him to play the
major part of each game, according
| to Bunn's plan.
The Indians played their poorest
I basketball of the conference wason
i in losing two games to U.C.L.A. last
i week-end. according to repoi"ts
■ from the South. After giving the
Bruins a run for their money Fri
day night, the. Card machine fell
j apart on Saturday to lose by a 28
to 18 score.
The play of Bill Doub at center
was outstanding for Stanford, how
• ever, while "Tiny Tom" Cordry
made his presence felt at all times.
Bruins Improved
The Bruins had greatly improved
since their appearance here at the
' opening of the season, according to
! Bunn, with Linthicum and Piper
J instrumental in the Uclan triumphs.
Over at Oakland Southern Cali
j fornia and California broke even in
! two games to leave the Trojans a
| full game in the lead for the south
ern division-title. The Bears, in
! order to retain the championship
I they won last season, would have
to win all their remaining games,
two each with U.C.L.A. and Stan
ford, while the Trojans were drop
ping a pair of contests to the same
teams.
j The Bruins already hold one vic-
I tory over U.S.C. and might annex
, another, while Stanford's chances
jof winning at least one of this
! week-end's games are not too re
mote. BUT there is just as much
j chance that California will meet a
reverse or two —and just one would
■ be fatal.
