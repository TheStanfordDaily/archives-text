Profits to lilt' W.A.A. for sponsoring Saturday's "De
pression Dance" in Roble (ivin amounted to something like
*")(> after all expenses had been paid. This was shown in
tb e report of the eoinmitlee in charge.
If the volume of receipts is any indication of the success
of the affair, and it is logical to assume thai this is true,
then the Daily cannot see any valid reason for not holding
similar parties oftener. Even if there had been less profit
or s if the W'.A.A. had just broken even, there would still be
justification for the party because so many people really
did have a good time.
rurther than the effective saving to the students and
tin tlier than the good time "that was had by all" lies the
fact that the good time was had at home. So after all, isn't
there a possibility that Stanford as a community can be
come more closely knit, with a resultant stimulation of
spirit; that circles of friendship and acquaintance can be
broadened; and finally that expense and distance are not
essential elements to entertainment?
