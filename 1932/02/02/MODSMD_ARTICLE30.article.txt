# BULL SESSION
## HOW ABOUT SHANGHAI? 
### 
After reading the Drool Session
yesterday, one could not help be
coming bench-conscious. I think
and dream of nothing now except
benches. Sometimes I iind one
broken over somebody's head. Other
times I think of the advisability of
benches in the "Cactus Gardens"—
nestled 'midst the cacti.
But more often, I wonder what
would happen if several Americans
were found dead on a Shanghai
bench with several lead slugs in
their respective persons. And giv
ing the morbid a fling, one wonders
what would happen if a slightly in
ebriated, cross-eyed Japanese gun
ner (and every army must have at
least one such person) would hap
pen to drop a shell among thirty
American tots sitting on their school
benches in the international settle
ment of Shanghai. Or if the press
leport stated that the children had
just risen from their benches and
were giving the "American Pledge"
when the "death missile" struck,
then what what would happen here?
We laugh at such a possibility;
we ridicule the very idea of w£r.
Most of us have been thinking and
talking Kellogg Pact, League of Na
tions, horror of war, useless slaugh
ter —for so long that we immedi
ately assume that nothing can ter
minate peace. Several unfortunate
incidents, fanned by war propa
ganda, and a depression, however,
could land us in the middle of a
nice, juicy war in very short notice.
Unemployment and over-production
would cease as vast armies started
shooting up ex-raw materials with

[ oil possible speed. Those that are
bored and want something new and
exciting would soon have it on a
i wholesale scale.
If the situation in Shanghai is as
' serious as the San Francisco papers
claim it is, the government should
: do something besides send ships and
soldiers to the trouble. There are
j 3,614 Americans in and about the
' danger zone. These people should
i be bundled right out to some safe
I place—like the Philippines—with
' out delay. Sure, that would peril
their business; but it's a case of
. the greatest good for the greatest
, number. Should those 3,614 make
possible the death of hundreds of
1 thousands?
i
And would hundreds of thousands
i go to war because several hundred
j people on the other side of the
world go Chicago, and get shot up?
; Sousa's "Field Artillery March"
would counteract thousands of
peace pamphlets; "Stars and Stripes
Forever" would aid blotting about
1917; propaganda woidd create the
necessary hate; economic depres
-1 sion would furnish a good motive;
and society debs in khaki outfits
I would do the rest.
i This whole Shanghai affair may
| be just a front page savior to de
' spondent city editors—tired of Ruth
Judd and disgusted with politics.
If so, nothing need be done except
wait. If it is a genuine situation, it
is not too fantastic in the least to
i ship the American citizens out of
the danger zone.

After reading the Drool Session
yesterday, one could not help be
coming bench-conscious. I think
and dream of nothing now except
benches. Sometimes I iind one
broken over somebody's head. Other
times I think of the advisability of
benches in the "Cactus Gardens"—
nestled 'midst the cacti.
But more often, I wonder what
would happen if several Americans
were found dead on a Shanghai
bench with several lead slugs in
their respective persons. And giv
ing the morbid a fling, one wonders
what would happen if a slightly in
ebriated, cross-eyed Japanese gun
ner (and every army must have at
least one such person) would hap
pen to drop a shell among thirty
American tots sitting on their school
benches in the international settle
ment of Shanghai. Or if the press
leport stated that the children had
just risen from their benches and
were giving the "American Pledge"
when the "death missile" struck,
then what what would happen here?
We laugh at such a possibility;
we ridicule the very idea of w£r.
Most of us have been thinking and
talking Kellogg Pact, League of Na
tions, horror of war, useless slaugh
ter —for so long that we immedi
ately assume that nothing can ter
