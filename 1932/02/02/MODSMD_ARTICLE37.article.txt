It is not always possible to re
view two books at once but in the
case of these, the first two volumes
of a triology, it is not only possible
but practically essential. Apart from
the obvious disadvantage of length,
they might just have well been
combined in one volume.
The author has written a saga in
the manner of Galsworthy's "For
syte Saga" but of a family more
hot-blooded and more realistically
alive. The portraits of the individual
members of the Whiteoaks family,
constantly at strife with one an
other yet showing a solid arid un
breakable front to the outside
world, are drawn by a skilled pen,
expert In the use of words, shades
of meaning, and the subtle art of
suggesting situations and emotions
without allowing the mere words
use to obtrude upon the meaning
conveyed.
It is impossible to dislike any of
the members of this extraordinary
and highly seasoned family although
the table manners of Gran, that
volcanic old lady, who with great
satisfaction to herself manages to
attain the unusual age of 101, may
disgust and the affectations of young
Wake may annoy.
Many readers are scared away
from the usual saga type of novel
by a dearth of exciting happenings
and enthralling sex interests. There
is no excuse for sueh timidity in
the case of these two books. A
tangled and enthralling skein of
love interest runs through them and
tense situations are numerous,
though neither are stressed to the
point of sensationalism. —S.C.A.
MARY WIGMAN—At the Tivoli
Theatre, San Francisco.
1. How did she know—that we
had always thought of summer,
night, witches, etc., as being like
that!
2. Aside from her gift of inter
pretation, or self-expression, Mary
Wigman has the ability to create a
mood.
3. Ani then she has technique,
technique we feel justified in calling
perfect.
We discovered why this person,
•without music and on a bare stage,
can hold a sell-out house spell
bound when even Will Rogers has
to use a piece of rope.
Certain of the dances were char
acterized by tremendous strength
as, "Festive Rhythm" and "Invoca
tion," while in others such as, "Sum
mer," the dancer appeared langor
ous and seductive. A dance called
"Pastoral" especially pleased us.
Wigman, in a costume suggesting

peasant influence blue and silver,
red lining the full skirt - with the
simplicity that marks the dancing
of the ancient Greeks seemed to im
personate, successively, country
folk, a shepherd, Pan, and finally,
to create an atmosphere of rolling
hills and grassy valleys.
Mary Wigman originated her own
school of the dance. Commencing
J as a pupil of Laban, she has now
far out-distanced her teacher. Many
schools have been founded by her
followers through Europe and the
United States as well as in Ger
many. —E.T.P.
COCK OF THE AIR—AC the Var
sity Theatre.
Billie Dove never was much good
instead of foisting herself on an
( unsuspecting public as a supposedly
fascinating vamp in an equally sup
posedly t.musing picture, which only
j succeeds in being lousy in the ex
treme of the word and the word
itself means a lot. The whole thing
only succeeded in arousing the
; well-known and well-deserved bird
j from the assembled "roughage" in
| stead of the belly-laughs and ob-
I scene chuckles which it was obvi
! ously meant to evoke.
Billie Dove wears gowns which
, should shock the least fastidious of
j censors, but fail to go over with
J those of uncensorious minds because
I that which they reveal so generous
ly is not too good to look upon.
The redeeming feature was a
"Flip the Frog" cartoon which was
nothing short of excellent and pro-
I vided all the laughs which the fea
i ture failed to produce. A short
Pseudo-Collitch comedy, as blatant
j as most in its misrepresentation of
! college life, was also redeemed by
| some really funny initiation scenes
and situations. —S.C.A.
| LOVERS COURAGEOUS—At the
Fox-Stanford Theatre.
j Robert Montgomery is a would
: be playwright in this one. With a
i "heart courageous" he sets out to
! conquer Broadway and Madge
j Evans. Of course he does this very
thing, which makes it just another
j movie.
Madge Evans wears some won
; derful gowns; there are a lot of good
' African scenes which are quite
J realistic; and last of all there are
some of the most thrilling shots of
deep-sea fishing that we've seen in
a long while.
If you do go, stay away until after
the comedies and shorts are over.
They're terrible. —B.M.
Watches which hold a lipstick
arc a fashion fad in Paris; when
the lipstick is turned up for use
the movement winds the watch.

1. How did she know—that we
had always thought of summer,
night, witches, etc., as being like
that!
2. Aside from her gift of inter
pretation, or self-expression, Mary
Wigman has the ability to create a
mood.
3. Ani then she has technique,
technique we feel justified in calling
perfect.
We discovered why this person,
•without music and on a bare stage,
can hold a sell-out house spell
bound when even Will Rogers has
to use a piece of rope.
Certain of the dances were char
acterized by tremendous strength
as, "Festive Rhythm" and "Invoca
tion," while in others such as, "Sum
mer," the dancer appeared langor
ous and seductive. A dance called
"Pastoral" especially pleased us.

peasant influence blue and silver,
red lining the full skirt - with the
simplicity that marks the dancing
of the ancient Greeks seemed to im
personate, successively, country
folk, a shepherd, Pan, and finally,
to create an atmosphere of rolling
hills and grassy valleys.
Mary Wigman originated her own
school of the dance. Commencing
J as a pupil of Laban, she has now
far out-distanced her teacher. Many
schools have been founded by her
followers through Europe and the
United States as well as in Ger

Many readers are scared away
from the usual saga type of novel
by a dearth of exciting happenings
and enthralling sex interests. There
is no excuse for sueh timidity in

Theatre, San Francisco.
1. How did she know—that we
had always thought of summer,
night, witches, etc., as being like
that!
2. Aside from her gift of inter
pretation, or self-expression, Mary
Wigman has the ability to create a
mood.
3. Ani then she has technique,
technique we feel justified in calling
perfect.
We discovered why this person,
•without music and on a bare stage,
can hold a sell-out house spell
bound when even Will Rogers has
to use a piece of rope.
Certain of the dances were char
acterized by tremendous strength
as, "Festive Rhythm" and "Invoca
tion," while in others such as, "Sum
mer," the dancer appeared langor
ous and seductive. A dance called
"Pastoral" especially pleased us.
Wigman, in a costume suggesting

peasant influence blue and silver,
red lining the full skirt - with the
simplicity that marks the dancing
of the ancient Greeks seemed to im
personate, successively, country
folk, a shepherd, Pan, and finally,
to create an atmosphere of rolling
hills and grassy valleys.
Mary Wigman originated her own
school of the dance. Commencing
J as a pupil of Laban, she has now
far out-distanced her teacher. Many
schools have been founded by her
followers through Europe and the
United States as well as in Ger
many. —E.T.P.

Billie Dove never was much good
instead of foisting herself on an
( unsuspecting public as a supposedly
fascinating vamp in an equally sup
posedly t.musing picture, which only
j succeeds in being lousy in the ex
treme of the word and the word
itself means a lot. The whole thing
only succeeded in arousing the
; well-known and well-deserved bird
j from the assembled "roughage" in
| stead of the belly-laughs and ob-
I scene chuckles which it was obvi
! ously meant to evoke.
Billie Dove wears gowns which
, should shock the least fastidious of
j censors, but fail to go over with
J those of uncensorious minds because
I that which they reveal so generous
ly is not too good to look upon.
The redeeming feature was a
"Flip the Frog" cartoon which was
nothing short of excellent and pro-
I vided all the laughs which the fea
i ture failed to produce. A short
Pseudo-Collitch comedy, as blatant
j as most in its misrepresentation of
! college life, was also redeemed by
| some really funny initiation scenes
and situations. —S.C.A.

j Robert Montgomery is a would
: be playwright in this one. With a
i "heart courageous" he sets out to
! conquer Broadway and Madge
j Evans. Of course he does this very
thing, which makes it just another
j movie.
Madge Evans wears some won
; derful gowns; there are a lot of good
' African scenes which are quite
J realistic; and last of all there are
some of the most thrilling shots of
deep-sea fishing that we've seen in
a long while.
If you do go, stay away until after
the comedies and shorts are over.
They're terrible. —B.M.

It is not always possible to re
view two books at once but in the
case of these, the first two volumes
of a triology, it is not only possible
but practically essential. Apart from
the obvious disadvantage of length,
they might just have well been
combined in one volume.
The author has written a saga in
the manner of Galsworthy's "For
syte Saga" but of a family more
hot-blooded and more realistically
alive. The portraits of the individual
members of the Whiteoaks family,
constantly at strife with one an
other yet showing a solid arid un
breakable front to the outside
world, are drawn by a skilled pen,
expert In the use of words, shades
of meaning, and the subtle art of
suggesting situations and emotions
without allowing the mere words
use to obtrude upon the meaning
conveyed.
It is impossible to dislike any of
the members of this extraordinary
and highly seasoned family although
the table manners of Gran, that
volcanic old lady, who with great
satisfaction to herself manages to
attain the unusual age of 101, may
disgust and the affectations of young
Wake may annoy.
