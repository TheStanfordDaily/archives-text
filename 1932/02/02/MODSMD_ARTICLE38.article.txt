### Jack Allen 
Preliminary bouts to the All-Uni
versity boxing championships of
Thursday night will be held this
afternoon at 4:30 in the boxing
room. Weigh-ins will be from 10 to
1 o'clock today. Boxers are urged
by Coach Harry Maloney to be in
the boxing room by at least 4
o'clock.
Entries for the championships
closed last night with 30 men signed
up. With three bouts in each of a
number of weights, there will be
at least 14 fights in all Thursday
night.
Locey to Referee
Maloney received word yesterday
that Peter Flanagan wiil not be here
to referee. His place will be taken
by Percy Locey, athletic director of
Ihe Olympic Club. Ernie Caddell is
to act as announcer for the bouts.
The Phil Smith-Ben Palamoun
tain heavyweight bout still promises
to be the thriller of the evening.
There will also be keen competition
in the light-heavy division with
"Slip" Gilbert, Bud Ruschin, and
Paul Targhetta signed up and the
possibility that Fred Johnson will
be transferred to this weight.
Lightweights Even
Ben Matthews, Bill Rowland, and
Ed Insley, lightweights, look in
practice to be so evenly matched
that it i.; impossible to pick a pros
pective winner. There are four
other men in the same weight, any
one of whom may pull a surprise.
Look for some good lights in this
department.
In the bantamweight division
Harold Shanklin and Yuji Imai are
the probably finalists. There is little
to choose between them. John Hus
ton, Jim Feely, ar.d Mark Kai-Kee,
featherweights, will provide some
interesting bouts if they live up to
practice performances.
With three able boxers, the mid
dleweight department is well taken
care of. Fred Johnson and Jim Bell
both won their letters in competi
tion against California last year and
Don Fritk has boxed in exhibition
bouts as a freshman. Should John
son be shifted to light-heavy there
are three other men ready to take
his place.
Jim Kelley and Ira Jones are the
leading fighters in the welterweight
division and should put' on a real
scrap if they meet.
All in all the evening, from the
first bout to the presentation of
medals by Governor Rolph, is bound
to be a big one for Stanford fight

practice to be so evenly matched
that it i.; impossible to pick a pros
pective winner. There are four
other men in the same weight, any
one of whom may pull a surprise.
Look for some good lights in this
department.
In the bantamweight division
Harold Shanklin and Yuji Imai are
the probably finalists. There is little
to choose between them. John Hus
ton, Jim Feely, ar.d Mark Kai-Kee,
featherweights, will provide some
interesting bouts if they live up to
practice performances.
With three able boxers, the mid
dleweight department is well taken
care of. Fred Johnson and Jim Bell
both won their letters in competi
tion against California last year and
Don Fritk has boxed in exhibition
bouts as a freshman. Should John
son be shifted to light-heavy there
are three other men ready to take
his place.
Jim Kelley and Ira Jones are the
leading fighters in the welterweight
division and should put' on a real
scrap if they meet.
All in all the evening, from the
first bout to the presentation of
medals by Governor Rolph, is bound
to be a big one for Stanford fight
