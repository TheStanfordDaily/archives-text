# "GYPED," GROANS TRACK SQUAD AS TRAVELING ENDS
## 
### 
Travel may be broadening,
but not a mere 960 miles of it
when you are expecting or ac
eu tomed to three or four times
that distance. At least, that is
the opinion of the Stanford
ti :k team, that has already
belied the evidence furnished
by experts and coaches and
has pronounced that the 1932
season will be a dismal failure.
The reason for the doom of
th" Indian year in track is the
schedule, which includes but
three trips, two of which are
to Berkeleyâ€”for ihe Big meet
and the 1.C.4-A. s. And where
is the novelty in a trip to
Berkeley to the Stanford man?
The one respectable trip is
to Los Angeles for the U.S.C.
meet, but somehow Stanford
men haven't enjoyed southern
trip.; these last few years as
much as might be exported.
Even the managers are moan
ing and groaning, for why
should a man go out for track
mmager unless it is to compete
with the navy at Seattle or
with Harvard at Cambridge?
