SAM BARRY'S Terrible Trojans
didn't stall in last week-end's games
with California, but there is no
credit due them for the speed of
the two contests. "Nibs" Price, liv
ing up to his campaign pledges, sent
his forwards after the leering
U.S.C. guards, Capps and Bescos,
and forced the play, just as John
Bunn did in the two games played
here.
On several occasions the Tro
jan guards were chased within
their own foul line before they
got rid of the ball.
Always it was apparent that the
Bears not only played their own
game, but forced the Trojans to
play theirs. Whenever the Califor
nia forwards would hesitate mo
mentarily to see if Capps or Bescos
would play ball without being
goaded, the pair would remain
rooted to the floor until pursued.
. *
GIVING CREDIT where credit is
due, the Trojans proved their real
! strength in winning that heart
breaking 28 to 27 affair Saturday
night. There is strength there—but
NOT greatness. We did not see Fri
, day's game, but Saturday's at least
was marked by the same tumbling,
the same "foul-stealing"' tactics that
! featured the Trojan series here.
Reasonably good officiating,
j. however, kept the value of that
tumbling at a minimum—al
though the big Erskine, et al,
i did some of their very best
sprawling.

AT THAT, Barry's stalling could
be worse. Oh, yes it could! We
quote the following from an Asso
ciated Press dispatch from Omaha,
Nebraska:
"Moe Pressley, Omaha basketball
referee, told this for the unvar
nished truth:
"During the first half of the
Shenandoah - Clarinda game at
Shenandoah. lowa, the score at the
end of the first half was nothing io
nothing. Neither team attempted a
shot from the field. There were no
fouls, no held ball, no technical
violations, no time out, no substitu
tions, and the ball was never out
of bounds.
"Only twice during the half did
Pressley handle the ball. These oc
casions were at the stai't of the
game and at the start of the second
quarter.
"At the opening of each of (he
quarters the Clarinda center
had tipped llie ball to a Clar
inda guard, who retreated to a
corner and calmly surveyed the
Shenandoah five-man defense.
"The guard wouldn't go to the

' defense, and the defense wouldn't i
come to the guard.
"Clarinda won the game in an 1
overtime period, 9 to 7."
Wait until "Elevator Sam"
hears his 16-minute statuary i
record is broken!
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, by j
virtue of breaking even with Cali- ;
fornia, is still a full game ahead of j
! the pursuing Bears, and that one j
I game lead looks pretty big—it will j
I probably be big enough to win the i

SAM BARRY'S Terrible Trojans
didn't stall in last week-end's games
with California, but there is no
credit due them for the speed of
the two contests. "Nibs" Price, liv
ing up to his campaign pledges, sent
his forwards after the leering
U.S.C. guards, Capps and Bescos,
and forced the play, just as John
Bunn did in the two games played
here.
On several occasions the Tro
jan guards were chased within
their own foul line before they
got rid of the ball.
Always it was apparent that the
Bears not only played their own
game, but forced the Trojans to
play theirs. Whenever the Califor
nia forwards would hesitate mo
mentarily to see if Capps or Bescos
would play ball without being
goaded, the pair would remain
rooted to the floor until pursued.
. *
GIVING CREDIT where credit is
due, the Trojans proved their real
! strength in winning that heart
breaking 28 to 27 affair Saturday
night. There is strength there—but
NOT greatness. We did not see Fri
, day's game, but Saturday's at least
was marked by the same tumbling,
the same "foul-stealing"' tactics that
! featured the Trojan series here.
Reasonably good officiating,
j. however, kept the value of that
tumbling at a minimum—al
though the big Erskine, et al,
i did some of their very best
sprawling.

AT THAT, Barry's stalling could
be worse. Oh, yes it could! We
quote the following from an Asso
ciated Press dispatch from Omaha,
Nebraska:
"Moe Pressley, Omaha basketball
referee, told this for the unvar
nished truth:
"During the first half of the
Shenandoah - Clarinda game at
Shenandoah. lowa, the score at the
end of the first half was nothing io
nothing. Neither team attempted a
shot from the field. There were no
fouls, no held ball, no technical
violations, no time out, no substitu
tions, and the ball was never out
of bounds.
"Only twice during the half did
Pressley handle the ball. These oc
casions were at the stai't of the
game and at the start of the second
quarter.
"At the opening of each of (he
quarters the Clarinda center
had tipped llie ball to a Clar
inda guard, who retreated to a
corner and calmly surveyed the
Shenandoah five-man defense.
"The guard wouldn't go to the

' defense, and the defense wouldn't i
come to the guard.
"Clarinda won the game in an 1
overtime period, 9 to 7."
