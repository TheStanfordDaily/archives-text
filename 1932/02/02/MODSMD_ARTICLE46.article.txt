# FROSH HOOPSTERS REACH NEW LOW; LOSE TWO GAMES
## Guards Fail To Hold U.S.F., Enemy Center Is Good, Coiner Is Fair 
### 
The Stanford yearling hoopsters
dropped two slow contests over the !
week-end, losing a dismal 28-13
game to Jack O'Marie's San Fran
cisco University freshmen, and on
Saturday went down before the
strong Lowell High cagers, 23-11.
The Indian cagcrs hit a new low
since the Palo Alto and Pittsburg
season-openers in the game against
the SF.U. freshmen. The guards,
usually more reliable than any
members of the first quintet, could
not check the Dons at all. With Bob
Albers, one-time member of the
championship Y.M.I, quintet, as
chief spark, the San Francisco of
fense worked very smoothly, and
ran up an 18-4 lead at. half time.
Albers has suffered from an arm
injury for the last month, but
showed signs of returning to the
form which earned him a position
on the San Francisco club team a
week after graduating from Se
quoia High, in Redwood City.
Doomed to l-cse
Charier. Coiner was the only j
member of the Papoose quintet who J
could hit the basket at all Friday I
night, his work in the second half 1
netting six points.
Saturday's defeat at the hands of j
Lowell, the San Francisco prep!
champions, was a foregone conclu- j
sion, but the game was even more j
uneven than the 23-11 score would i
indicate.
Gordon Mallatratt opened up the i
game by sinking two long shots in j
the first minute of the game, and j
from that time on the Indians failed
to make another basket. Lory Roth- j
ert dropped in four free throws out j
of five tries during the game, while
free shots by the Coiner twins, to- j
tailing five in all, made up the rest
of the Stanford total.
The freshmen played a much
better game on Saturday than on j
Friday, but the Lowell Cardinals j
were obviously having an off night j
on shooting. Ritchie Hay, gigantic :
Lowell center, missed countless j
set-ups throughout the contest, but ;
managed tQ sink enough to gain ■
high-point honors with eleven j
markers.
The Lowell defense was unusually
good for a high-school team. They j
passed well, but couldn't sink their j
shots. Although the freshmen held |
the Lowellites to as low a score as
the most enthusiastic Indian sup- j
porters had hoped, the Papooses;
were far from the form they showed i
on the previous week-end against I
Fresno High and the California !
freshmen.

game to Jack O'Marie's San Fran
cisco University freshmen, and on
Saturday went down before the
strong Lowell High cagers, 23-11.
The Indian cagcrs hit a new low
since the Palo Alto and Pittsburg
season-openers in the game against
the SF.U. freshmen. The guards,
usually more reliable than any
members of the first quintet, could
not check the Dons at all. With Bob
Albers, one-time member of the
championship Y.M.I, quintet, as
chief spark, the San Francisco of
fense worked very smoothly, and
ran up an 18-4 lead at. half time.
Albers has suffered from an arm
injury for the last month, but
showed signs of returning to the
form which earned him a position
on the San Francisco club team a
week after graduating from Se
quoia High, in Redwood City.
Doomed to l-cse
Charier. Coiner was the only j
member of the Papoose quintet who J
could hit the basket at all Friday I
night, his work in the second half 1
netting six points.
Saturday's defeat at the hands of j
Lowell, the San Francisco prep!
champions, was a foregone conclu- j
sion, but the game was even more j
uneven than the 23-11 score would i
indicate.
Gordon Mallatratt opened up the i
game by sinking two long shots in j
the first minute of the game, and j
from that time on the Indians failed
to make another basket. Lory Roth- j
ert dropped in four free throws out j
of five tries during the game, while
free shots by the Coiner twins, to- j
tailing five in all, made up the rest
of the Stanford total.
The freshmen played a much
better game on Saturday than on j
Friday, but the Lowell Cardinals j
were obviously having an off night j
on shooting. Ritchie Hay, gigantic :
Lowell center, missed countless j
set-ups throughout the contest, but ;
managed tQ sink enough to gain ■
high-point honors with eleven j
markers.
The Lowell defense was unusually
good for a high-school team. They j
passed well, but couldn't sink their j
shots. Although the freshmen held |
the Lowellites to as low a score as
the most enthusiastic Indian sup- j
porters had hoped, the Papooses;
were far from the form they showed i
on the previous week-end against I
Fresno High and the California !
freshmen.
The Stanford yearling hoopsters
dropped two slow contests over the !
week-end, losing a dismal 28-13
game to Jack O'Marie's San Fran

Saturday went down before the
