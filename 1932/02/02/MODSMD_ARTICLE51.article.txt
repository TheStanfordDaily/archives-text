Proving themselves better night—
| hawks than their less worldly op
; ponent?, ►■n.. iford's fencers decisive-
I ly defeated Doth the Olympic Club
I '.<id the University of California last
Friday night for the team foil
championship of the Bay Division
of the A.F.L.A.
The excellent condition of the In
dian team finally prevailed at 2:10
o'clock Saturday morning, at which
time Leicester, the Club's star
fencer, lealized that his cohorts
were beaten and called off the final
match between himself and Captain
Leonard Pockman of the tireless
Indians. That gave Stanford a live
10 three score against the club to
couple with her seven matches to
two won from the Golden Bear.
Improvement Shown
John Ferguson, who almost failed
jto make the Cardinal team, per
! sonally took care of impressing
Coaches Maloney and Bugge with
his real worth Friday, when he won
five of his six bouts and proved
himself the best fencer on the floor.
If Ferguson continues to show im
provement in his adeptness at han
| dling foils, he will have a good
j chance to cop the individual cham
| pionship.
! Pockman won three out of his five
j bouts, and showed nearly as much
; proficiency with the foil as he had
! the week before when he qualified
| for the Pacific Coast finals with the
I saber.
j Dick Criley, the third member of
| the Stanford team, took three out
j of six to bring the Indian total to
I eleven bouts won to six lost for the
evening. Criley was alternately hot
I and cold Friday, winning two bouts
Iby one-sided margins, losing two
the same way, and breaking even in
the two matches that went to five to
four.
Scores Early Ilits
The Olympic Club team consisted
of Leicester, Lorber, and Smith,
j Dempsey, Locke, and Malozemoff
i fenced for California, the latter
| scoring hits in the early part of
j each of his matches while his op
j ponents were getting used to his
name. '
