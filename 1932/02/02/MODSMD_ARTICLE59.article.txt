War-ridden, publicized China is j
fit thj present time the home of !
thirty-two Stanford alumni, eighteen j
of whom are Chinese who have j
graduated from this institution and !
then returned home, probably with- i

education would be followed by a I

living in the Orient in spite of the j
dangers apparent in that part of the |
globe, five are women.

tary, the ladies are engaged in a I
variety of work. Two are employed j
by newspapers, one is working in
an information bureau, one is the |
wife of a navy officer, and one has j
made her home in the blood-stained '■
city of Shanghai.
The nine remaining white men |
are in varied vocations. Hallett A. ;
Abend is a correspondent of the j
New York Times. Horatio B. Haw- |
kins and Donald B. Monroe are in j
the customs service, while Jay C. ]
Hustpn is the Economic Counsel of '■
the American Consulate. Ernest H.

Oil Company of New York, and !

missioner. Dr. Harold L. Weaver is ,
