Outclassing their rivals in every
department of the game, the Kappa I
Sigs squashed the Breakers 18-4 in i
a dull game last night, placing
themselves in a deadlock for the
leadership of League VI with the
Delta Chi quintet which also came
out on top by defeating Sigma Nu
9-5 in a slow but closely fought af
fair.
With Newt Goldman ringing the
basket for nine points, the Kappa
Sigs kept the Breakers from scor
ing a single field goal in the first
half. The Row men had run up ten
points betore the club outfit made
their first foul shot. It was only a
basket by Pete Holmes in the sec
ond period that kept the losing
quintet from being completely
whitewashed in the . way of field I
goals.
Foul Shots Fail
Ability to sink their many foul
shots could have won for the Sigma
Nu outfit, but out of no less than J
seven attempted free throws in the j
second half, only one was made, j
Beede of the losers and Dick Pax-J
ton of the Delta Chi's shared high- j
point honors with three digits to |
their credit. The game was closely j
fought in the first half, with the j
score f>-4 at the end of the period,]
but tho Sigma Nu's were held to a I
single foul shot in the last stanza, I
while Paxton registered three points |
for the winners.
Hashers Triumph
The Menlo Hashers proved that
they are a team to be reckoned with
when they completely submerged
the Beta Theta Pi cagers 27-3, the
Row men failing to score a single ;
field goal. Art McGarr rang up >
seven points to lead in scoring, but 1
was closely followed by his team
mate, Jim Anderson, who made |
three baskets. The Hashers showed
a well-balanced offense and an
ability to hit the basket, while the ;
Betas were unable to sink their j
many long shots. Ralph Martin
made two points for the losers, both
on foul shots.
Superior height proved too great !
a handicap for the Chinese Club to I
overcome in their game with the j
Sequoia II quintet, and the hall men {
came out on the long end of a 19-6 j
score. Winston Strong, Sequoia cen
ter, again showed his basket-shoot- !
ing ability by making thirteen of ,
his team's nineteen points. Stan |
Moy was the best man on the floor
for the Chinese aggregation, and in '
addition to his capable floorwork, i
he managed to score four points. '
Lloyd Phillips, Sequoia's midget |
forward, gave the fans quite a treat j
with his fast floor game. Phillips!
stands ltss than four feet in height, j
but makes up for his short stature I
with quick and clever dribbling.
"Pop" Gabriel rcfereed the Pa
vilion games, while Ed Woodworth
took charge of the encounters in the
gymnasium.
