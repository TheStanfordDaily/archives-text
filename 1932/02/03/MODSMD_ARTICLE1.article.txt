# BUNN INTENDS TO EMPHASIZE NEW OFFENSE
## 'Frenchy' LaConibe Moved Back To Baker's Guard Position By Coach BREAK SLOW DEFENSE Cosgrove, Jay Tod, Paired On Second String 
### 
To concentrate Stanford's highest
powered scoring guns and sacrifice
the team's defensive ability, or to
have .1 great defensive team which
fails to score enough points to win
ball games: that is the question that
is facing Coach John Bunn as the
Indians prepare to invade the walls
of Troy.
As suddenly as he had moved
"Frenchy" LaCombe back to Baker's
guard position, Bunn moved the er
ratic forward into the front ranks
again, and returned to his old fa
vorites, the LaCombe, Cordry,
Packard, Norgard, and Baker com
bination.
Cosgrove-Baker Paired
But Bunn is still unconvinced
lhat somebody won't fit his brand
new idea, so on the second string
he had Jack Cosgrove paired with
Jay Tod, and the former Menlo
ace looked fair on both the offense
and the defense. Bunn also had
Palmer and Meade at the forward
berths on the second team, and the
work of Palmer in the early part
of the session gave him a try on
the varsity the first time Bunn
switched in the substitutes. Palmer
has been getting better steadily,
without lating much attention from
the fans, but Bunn has a habit of
watching everyone on the squad,
and it shouldn't be any great sur
prise to see him get into a game
pretty soon.
"We're going back to fundamen
tals, learn them, and then use them,"
Bunn told the squad. "We may know
them already, but we haven't shown
it lately, and after this season I'll
know that they are there. We give
Ihe opposing team the majority of
its points on a silver platter."
Doub-Packard Battle
The battle between Doub and
Packard for the center position is
still as hot as it was a couple of
weeks ago. The former has more
spring and is faster, but Big Dave
lias the reach, and when the team
is up against a uniformly tall quin
tet that means a lot. The overhead
passing game probably isn't any
better than the system that Bunn
uses, but when you give the over
head game the benefit of height also,
it is a tough proposition to beat, as
the Indians found out to their sor
row against California.
Stanford could have learned a lot
from the way U.C.L.A. team used
the so-called cartwheel attack. In
fact Coach Bunn brought up the
subject after the first two games
and stiesscd the advantage to be
gained from the constant milling
around or "breaking" which the
Southerners employed so effective
ly. Aside from the gain in naving
the ball, Ihe attacking team doesn't
have to figure out what the opposi
tion is going to do with it, and
therefore in keeping constantly on
the move they are further compli
cating the situation for the de
fensive team.
Cardinal teams of past years have
been characterized by the slow
breaking offense, which has no re
lation to the "Phog" Allen system,
and Bunn seems to feel that if he
can all five of the men on the
move at the same time the win
column may look a lot healthier for
a change.
Stanford doesn't expect to be re
sponsible for any stalling next week
end.

head game the benefit of height also,
it is a tough proposition to beat, as
the Indians found out to their sor
row against California.
Stanford could have learned a lot
from the way U.C.L.A. team used
the so-called cartwheel attack. In
fact Coach Bunn brought up the
subject after the first two games
and stiesscd the advantage to be
gained from the constant milling
around or "breaking" which the
Southerners employed so effective
ly. Aside from the gain in naving
the ball, Ihe attacking team doesn't
have to figure out what the opposi
tion is going to do with it, and
therefore in keeping constantly on
the move they are further compli
cating the situation for the de
fensive team.
Cardinal teams of past years have
been characterized by the slow
breaking offense, which has no re
lation to the "Phog" Allen system,
and Bunn seems to feel that if he
can all five of the men on the
move at the same time the win
column may look a lot healthier for
a change.
Stanford doesn't expect to be re
sponsible for any stalling next week
end.
To concentrate Stanford's highest
powered scoring guns and sacrifice
the team's defensive ability, or to
have .1 great defensive team which
fails to score enough points to win
ball games: that is the question that
is facing Coach John Bunn as the
Indians prepare to invade the walls
of Troy.
As suddenly as he had moved
"Frenchy" LaCombe back to Baker's
guard position, Bunn moved the er
ratic forward into the front ranks
again, and returned to his old fa
vorites, the LaCombe, Cordry,
Packard, Norgard, and Baker com
bination.
Cosgrove-Baker Paired
But Bunn is still unconvinced
lhat somebody won't fit his brand
new idea, so on the second string
he had Jack Cosgrove paired with
Jay Tod, and the former Menlo
ace looked fair on both the offense
and the defense. Bunn also had
Palmer and Meade at the forward
berths on the second team, and the
work of Palmer in the early part
of the session gave him a try on
the varsity the first time Bunn
switched in the substitutes. Palmer
has been getting better steadily,
without lating much attention from
the fans, but Bunn has a habit of
watching everyone on the squad,
and it shouldn't be any great sur
prise to see him get into a game
pretty soon.
"We're going back to fundamen
tals, learn them, and then use them,"
Bunn told the squad. "We may know
them already, but we haven't shown
it lately, and after this season I'll
know that they are there. We give
Ihe opposing team the majority of
its points on a silver platter."
Doub-Packard Battle
The battle between Doub and
Packard for the center position is
still as hot as it was a couple of
weeks ago. The former has more
spring and is faster, but Big Dave
lias the reach, and when the team
is up against a uniformly tall quin
tet that means a lot. The overhead
passing game probably isn't any
better than the system that Bunn
uses, but when you give the over
head game the benefit of height also,
it is a tough proposition to beat, as
the Indians found out to their sor
row against California.
