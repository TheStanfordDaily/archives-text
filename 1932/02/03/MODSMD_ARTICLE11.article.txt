# World Seeks Vocational Guidance From Stanford
## 
### 
Schoolboys, educators, business'
men, magazine writers, college stu- '<
dents, '"the butcher, the baker, the
candelstick-maker," all seek infor
mation from Stanford's vocational
guidance service, according to C. j
Gilbert Wrcnn, executive secretary.
In examining his correspondence
files, Wrenn found letters from all
types of people, almost every state I
in the Union, and foreign countries, i
The letters display the individu
ality of their authors. For example,
in girlish handwriting is a letter, "1
am a high-school student and it is
)Viy wish to become an interior
decorator," while briefly typed, from
an Eastern university comes a re
quest for the vocational guidance
bulletin published by Stanford Uni
versity.
Giving an address quaintly la
beled, "Near the Zoo, Giza. Egypt,'
i: schoolboy wrote concerning a fu
ture occcupation. Wrenn was amused
by the Egyptian student's statement.
"I think that all vocations arc over
crowded now."
A request that almost stumped
Stanford's vocational guidance sec- j
retary was one concerning the field
nf "ceramic engineering." Data

1 about this rare technical pursuit
| was finally obtained; much of it
from a lecture by Dean Hoover of
the engineering school.
Highly prized by Wrenn are let-
J ters such as one from Detroit,
Michigan, stating, "I wish to thank
you for your kind interest and ef
| fort on my behalf." Another youth
wrote that Daniel A. Poling, of the
National Youth Radio Conference,
had advised him to seek vocational
guidance information from Stan
ford.
A writer for a women's magazine
asked a series of questions pertain
ing to vocations for women.
A few of the vocations for which
information was sought are naval
architecture, baking, opportunities
other than teaching for women, a
Ph.D. in psychology, business ad
ministration, stock brokerage, for
eign trade, mathematics for women,
public health laboratory worker,
t vocational guidance work, college
j registrar, personnel work, engineer
ing. Y.M.C.A. work, chemistry,
landscape architecture, statistical
| work, bacteriology, forestry, ceram
ic engineering, and diplomatic ser
vice.
