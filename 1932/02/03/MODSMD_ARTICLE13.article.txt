# Elimination Of Private Profit Control Basis
## Thompson Outlines Bratt System Of Prohibition In Tuesday Lecture 
### 
Private profit should be elirni- j
nated from the liquor business in |
! the opinion of Dr. Walter Thomp- ;
! son, associate professor of Political ;
j Science, who spoke in the Assembly j
; Hall last night on "The Swedish ,
; System of Liquor Control."
! Dr. Thompson studied the Bratt
, System of control in Sweden over !
j a period of months. He said that Dr.
| Bratt found that prohibition cannot
; be enforced when a profit can be i
j made from illegal sales, or when ;
j public opinion is against it.
Hard Liquor Started It
"The liquor problem started in
j Sweden only when hard liquor was <
| introduced," said Dr. Thompson. "It
I was first used as a cure for ail
| ments, and later as a preventative. I
I Thus there was a change from the 1
i medicinal to the beverage stage."
Dr. Thompson said that the per
j capita consumption of liquor of
I each male in Sweden a few hundred ;
i years ago was over 100 quarts a
j year. It is now restricted to a com- !
j paratively few liters per month for i
J each person. The liquor is dis- |
i tributed by companies under gov-, I
I ernmental control. Thus while the |
. profits of liquor distribution go to I
i the government, the adverse psycho- !
| logical effect of the government j
• being in the liquor business is j
j i>voided.
Government Benefits
One of the results of the Bratt j
I System, according to Dr. Thomp- j
son, are that the Swedish govern- I
j ment benefits greatly financially, j
i Sweden, with a population and area
( about that of California, receives j
i an annual income of over 50 mil- i
! lion dollars from control of liquor.
The Bratt System makes the peo- j
pie liquor-conscious, in the opinion j
of Dr. Thompson. The youth waits !
anxiously until he is 23, which is |
the age when he may begin to pur- |
chase liquor, and when he has i
reached this position of "manhood"
is almost sure to start drinking to
the full capacity of the law.

Government Benefits
One of the results of the Bratt j
I System, according to Dr. Thomp- j
son, are that the Swedish govern- I
j ment benefits greatly financially, j
i Sweden, with a population and area
( about that of California, receives j
i an annual income of over 50 mil- i
! lion dollars from control of liquor.
The Bratt System makes the peo- j
pie liquor-conscious, in the opinion j
of Dr. Thompson. The youth waits !
anxiously until he is 23, which is |
the age when he may begin to pur- |
chase liquor, and when he has i
reached this position of "manhood"
is almost sure to start drinking to
the full capacity of the law.
Private profit should be elirni- j
nated from the liquor business in |
! the opinion of Dr. Walter Thomp- ;
! son, associate professor of Political ;
j Science, who spoke in the Assembly j
; Hall last night on "The Swedish ,
; System of Liquor Control."
! Dr. Thompson studied the Bratt
, System of control in Sweden over !
j a period of months. He said that Dr.
| Bratt found that prohibition cannot
; be enforced when a profit can be i
j made from illegal sales, or when ;
j public opinion is against it.
Hard Liquor Started It
"The liquor problem started in
j Sweden only when hard liquor was <
| introduced," said Dr. Thompson. "It
I was first used as a cure for ail
| ments, and later as a preventative. I
I Thus there was a change from the 1
i medicinal to the beverage stage."
Dr. Thompson said that the per
j capita consumption of liquor of
I each male in Sweden a few hundred ;
i years ago was over 100 quarts a
j year. It is now restricted to a com- !
j paratively few liters per month for i
J each person. The liquor is dis- |
i tributed by companies under gov-, I
I ernmental control. Thus while the |
. profits of liquor distribution go to I
i the government, the adverse psycho- !
| logical effect of the government j
• being in the liquor business is j
