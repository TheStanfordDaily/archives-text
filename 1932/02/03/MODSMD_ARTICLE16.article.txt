Fighting evenly all the way, the
load constantly see-sawed from one
side to the other. It was only Bost's
sensational basket from mid-court
at the end of the game which kept
his squad from being beaten by a
one-point margin.
Carr Is Effective
After the first floor five had held
the lead throughout most of the
opening period, Howie Carr broke
through their defense with two ef
fective shots which gave the 2E's a
10-8 margin at half time.
Howie Carr and Johnnie Beatty of
the winners scored six points apiece,
while Don Bacon registered the
same total for the IE cause. Bost
also tallied four points.
This victory puts the Encina five
in a tie for the lead of League VII
with the Menlo Hashers, both squads
having won two games.

a tie with El Toro for the leader
ship of League 111 by defeating the
A.K.L. five 13-11 in the other game
last night.
At the end of the half, the A.K.L.'s
held a 5-4 lead, but the Thcta's
opened the second stanza with a fast
passing attack and made good on
most of their shots at the hoop, with
the result that they had a 13-5 lead
before the other quintet got started.
Cornell Finds Eye
Cornell was the only man on the
losing side who was able to hit the
basket with any regularity, and he
accounted for nine of his team's
total points. Brown scored two bas
kets for the winners.
Buster Holmes referccd both
games.
With the results of these games
