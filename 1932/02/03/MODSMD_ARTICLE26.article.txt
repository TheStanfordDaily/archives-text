# CONGRATULATIONS AND ALL THAT
## 
### 
The cud of Volume 80 of I lie 1 )aii.y loomed horribly near
on Ihe horizon yesterday as Publicat ions Council ehose
Willis Sullivan to occupy (lie driver's seat of Stanford's
newspaper for the coining term.
That choice climaxed for the blue-eyed youth from
Boise, Idaho, nearly three years of work on the Daily, dur
ing which period lie saw service as reporter, Associated
Press editor, night editor and associate editor. To this ex
perience he can add a professional background gained with
the Idaho Statesman, so there is little doubt that he is well
equipped for the post of Daii.y chieftain.
Felicitations, etcetera. Sully. Volume <S1 will be yours
to play with, and it is a copper-riveted cinch that an in
teresting, well-edited Daii/. will greet the campus at break
fast from February until June.
