# CARELESSNESS AND QUESTIONABLE JUDGMENT
## 
### 
A combination of carelessness and snap judgment riled
up the freshman class last Friday, and as a result, the
Kncina smoker was not held and the smoker chairman re
signed in disgust, Reports of the affair indicate, that the
blame, if you want to call it blame, can be more or less
equally allotted to Charles Flanagan, chairman of the
smoker, Robert Brown, student body president, and A1
1 )enny, student manager.
It seems that Flanagan, some time ago, went to Brown
and asked if lie would have to apply for a smoker date
ihrough the Hxecutive Committee, as is done with dance
dates. Brown told him such procedure was not necessary,
and that the smoker might be held at any time. When
Flanagan suggested Friday, January .'JO, Brown, not think
ing that it was a closed date reserved for the production of
"Bird in Hand," told him it was O.K. However, he warned
Flanagan to make no purchases for (lie smoker until he
had received his authorizations through the regular chan
nels at the A.S.S.I.
Flanagan, though, went ahead and purchased food for
the event out of his own pocket, neglecting to procure au
thorizations. Then, lale Friday afternoon, Denny learned,
apparently for the tirst time, that the smoker was to be
held that evening. He called Flanagan and told him that
the conflict with the play made it necessary that the fresh
man event be cancelled in order that the play attendance
would not he hampered in any way.
So the smoker was postponed and everybody is pretty
much up on his respective ear. The trouble might have
been avoided if Brown had stopped to think about the date,
or if Flanagan had gone around to the A.S.S.I'. ofliee for
his authorization, in which case he would have learned of
the conflict with the Dramatic Council, it might have been
alleviated somewhat it Denny had given the freshmen
permission to hold their smoker that night from 7 o'clock
until K o'clock, thereby allowing those frosh who desired
to see the play to do so.
But Brown did not think, and Flanagan did not follow
llistrneti< iis, and Denny abruptly cancelled the smoker
entirely instead of taking a less drastic course of action,
with unfortunate results.

alleviated somewhat it Denny had given the freshmen
permission to hold their smoker that night from 7 o'clock
until K o'clock, thereby allowing those frosh who desired
to see the play to do so.
But Brown did not think, and Flanagan did not follow
llistrneti< iis, and Denny abruptly cancelled the smoker
entirely instead of taking a less drastic course of action,
with unfortunate results.
A combination of carelessness and snap judgment riled
up the freshman class last Friday, and as a result, the
Kncina smoker was not held and the smoker chairman re
signed in disgust, Reports of the affair indicate, that the
blame, if you want to call it blame, can be more or less
equally allotted to Charles Flanagan, chairman of the
smoker, Robert Brown, student body president, and A1
1 )enny, student manager.
It seems that Flanagan, some time ago, went to Brown
and asked if lie would have to apply for a smoker date
ihrough the Hxecutive Committee, as is done with dance
dates. Brown told him such procedure was not necessary,
and that the smoker might be held at any time. When
Flanagan suggested Friday, January .'JO, Brown, not think
ing that it was a closed date reserved for the production of
"Bird in Hand," told him it was O.K. However, he warned
Flanagan to make no purchases for (lie smoker until he
had received his authorizations through the regular chan
nels at the A.S.S.I.
Flanagan, though, went ahead and purchased food for
the event out of his own pocket, neglecting to procure au
thorizations. Then, lale Friday afternoon, Denny learned,
apparently for the tirst time, that the smoker was to be
held that evening. He called Flanagan and told him that
the conflict with the play made it necessary that the fresh
man event be cancelled in order that the play attendance
would not he hampered in any way.
So the smoker was postponed and everybody is pretty
much up on his respective ear. The trouble might have
been avoided if Brown had stopped to think about the date,
or if Flanagan had gone around to the A.S.S.I'. ofliee for
his authorization, in which case he would have learned of
the conflict with the Dramatic Council, it might have been
alleviated somewhat it Denny had given the freshmen
permission to hold their smoker that night from 7 o'clock
until K o'clock, thereby allowing those frosh who desired
to see the play to do so.
But Brown did not think, and Flanagan did not follow
llistrneti< iis, and Denny abruptly cancelled the smoker
entirely instead of taking a less drastic course of action,
with unfortunate results.
