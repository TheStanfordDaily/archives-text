# JAZZ AND POLITICS
## 
### 
Yidor Aloysius Movers lias thrown a wrench inlo Ihe
elections lor mayor al Seattle. Meyers, who is a jazz hand
leader, started a circus campaign to burlesque the other
nine candidates and is now seeking nomination at the pri
maries February 2.5.
Meyers' platform is a hostess for every street car and
( incked ice for the "owl" cars, lie promises that policemen
will dress in hula skirls, tlower boxes will decorate all the
hydrants and bleachers and music will be provided for
those who gather to watch steamshovels work in excava
tions.
(ius Hasselbiad, a I present piccolo player in Meyers'
band will be the new chief of police and a department of
worrying about taxes will be installed for the benefit of Hip
citizens.
I his burlesque campaign is not a great deal more out-
I.oldish than a lot of the capers cut by politicians who act
in all seriousness such as Huey Long's actions, which have
kept Louisiana in an uproar. The length which Meyers'
campaign has gone is indicative of what can be accom
plished in modern government by politicians.
Pity all the poor Chinese. They are held up by bandits,
shot down in the streets and robbed by unscrupulous of
ficials. They sutler from famine, disease and floods. In
this country we have no floods. Dnihj Ilfini.
