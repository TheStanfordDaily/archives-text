# BULL SESSION
## TO BE OR NOT TO BE? 
### 
The big question that is puzzling
the campus l'rom the broad expanse
; of shimmering Lagunita to the
rolling plains of the landing lield is
' whether or not the "depression
i dances" are to be campus affairs.
Before the last one was over, it had
degenerated into a tri-hybrid—part
jolly-up, part Paly High Junior-
Senior prom (if they have such a
thing), and a third part Pink-Moon
over-Rainbow-Ballroom. How can
' a post-prosperity dance feel with
three such divergent strains running
through its twenty-cent veins?
Despite all this, the W.A.A. affair
last Saturday was a pleasant eve
; ning. II was especially enjoyable for
■ those men that came about ten
thirty or so; for they found most of
1 the men already nursing cracked
shoulder blades from being "tapped"
so many times while the better
; partners had not yet been led away.
Ol course, there was a crowd, but
that was to be expected. Somehow,
one doesn't mind being kicked and
kicking back as long as the sport
j is kept at home. But when nice
i friendly shin digging becomes a
foreign war, then we object.
How many outsiders there were
is a matter of the gravest specula
tion —-it least speculation. One irate
placed the number at 50 per cent,
which is probably much too high.
1 Suffice it to say that there were a
goodly number of people at the
! dance who have never seen the
! sacred walls of Stanford except on
Sunday afternoon, perhaps, when
they have joined the horde seeking
Hoover's home and the Memorial

| Church. And further, the chances !
are that this number will be multi- j
plied many times by the next de- j
pression dance for good news travels
fast.
To reserve this type uf affair to j
those who have the doubtful pleas- j
lire of paying $99 every quarter, the :
W.A.A. should demand the student j
body card before admitting a cou- i
. pie. This may tend to decrease their j
' gate receipts; but let them not try !
to kill the goose that lays these '
twenty-cent eggs. Because, if at the j
next depression dance, the outland
trs that come to twenty-five-cent- j
per-couple dances —crowd the place, '
the whole thing will be ruined; and j
the W.A.A. will be boycotted by |
the campus. That is only natural. !
And there is no doubt that more j
and more of these people will come; j
' for no dance hall in America can
give them an entire evening for the 1
i small sum of 25 cents—one quarter I
of a dollar.
We do not mean to imply, how- !
ever, that imports should be barred.
That, indeed, would be the grossest j
kind of folly. The number of women I
at these affairs is already small
enough to give them more than a !
proper estimation of their own
worth. To cut imports, however, !
would create conditions unbearable j
and intolerable—painfully excruci
ating. But to make each couple pro- ]
duce a student body card will make
campus dances campus dances—by i
the students—of the students—and
for the students instead of with the
students, on top of the students, and
between the students,

at these affairs is already small

The big question that is puzzling
the campus l'rom the broad expanse

rolling plains of the landing lield is
' whether or not the "depression
i dances" are to be campus affairs.
Before the last one was over, it had
degenerated into a tri-hybrid—part
jolly-up, part Paly High Junior-
Senior prom (if they have such a
thing), and a third part Pink-Moon
over-Rainbow-Ballroom. How can
' a post-prosperity dance feel with
three such divergent strains running
through its twenty-cent veins?
Despite all this, the W.A.A. affair
last Saturday was a pleasant eve

■ those men that came about ten
thirty or so; for they found most of
1 the men already nursing cracked
shoulder blades from being "tapped"
so many times while the better
