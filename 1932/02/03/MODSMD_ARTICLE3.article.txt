Jose Iturbi, Spanish virtuoso, I
famed as one of the world's leading j
pianists, will present a concert of j
both modern and classical composi- i
tions in the Pavilion tonight at 8:1)0 i
o'clock. After his first season of I
three months in 1929 in this coun- j
try, Iturbi has made his name a j
household word in musical Amer- j
ica. His success has rivalled that j
of the world's greatest musicians.
Iturbi is popular with every kind j
of public. He has presented three '
sold-out Carnegia Hall recitals each ]
season since his first appearance in |
New York, and was a particular I
favorite of university audiences last |
winter.
Child Prodigy
Hailed as a child prodigy, the j
Spanish pianist had his first music j
lesson at the age of three. He i
graduated from the Paris Conserva- '
toire with first honors when he was i
seventeen years old. In 1919 he be- j
came head of the piano faculty of j
the Conservatory of Geneva, a po- t
sition once held by Liszt. After four i
years, ho resigned in order to take j
up concert work, in which he has
achieved outstanding success.
A phenomenal musical and tech- j
nical equipment are the possession j
of Iturbi, according to New York [
critics. They describe him as an j
artist to the tips of his fingers, an j
artist of fastidious taste and of j
keen understanding, and as being I
unable to play unmusically.

duction of fifty cents over previous
