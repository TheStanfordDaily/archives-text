A BILL OF ONE-ACT PLAYS,
WITH AN EXCURSION INTO
MODERN GERMAN DANCING—
At the Palo Alto Community
Theatre.
Mystery surrounds the selection
of Stanley Houghton's "Fancy Free"
and Hanns Ilinn's "Poverty" for
Community Theatre production
when there are still unproduced
dramas by Pirandello, Shaw, O'Neill,
Synge, and some of their lighter |
compatriots.
Good one-act plays are scarce,
but a search further and more ar
duous than the present one might
be instituted to provide Monday .
night programs of the players.
This program was very feeble in
deed, livened only by occasionally
witty flashes in Houghton's play
and an extemporaneous, improper,
and amusing burlesque of the dance
group by two unshaven individuals i
who had watched the antics from
backstage.
Harriet Greenhood's dances were j
interesting but obviously not. de- |
signed for such close production as j
the Community House stage de- j
mands. Incidentally, streaming reds '
would, it seems to me, have been
more appropriate than the nice little I
pastel bloomers for "Attack," as j
danced by the (local) ladies of the j
ensemble. ■—J.S.S.

FINCH'S FORTUNE—By Mazo tie
la Roche, Douhleday l)oran. 19111.
This is the final book in a trilogy
telling the story of the excitable
and exciting Whiteoaks family. For
those who have read Jalna and
Whiteoaks of Jalna a review is su
perfluous since they will read this
book too —that is if they are not

i entirely devoid of all appreciation !
'■ of that which is good.
In this book the author tells the t
tale of the small fortune which falls j
to the lot of the ugly duckling of
1 the family and what he does with :
it, proving in the end that he had i
been the proverbial swan all the
time. Speaking of swans the author 1
i should not allow this book to be i
the sw in song of the Whiteoak fam- '
1 ily. She has made them live so com- (
1 pietely in the mind of the reader j
that it would be more than unfair j
to let them die such an untimely |
j death.
Had dc la Roche preceded Gals- j
worthy ir the eye of the public there
is very little doubt that the White- j
oak saga would now enjoy the same 1
reputation as the Forsyte Saga. 1
There is the same ability of por- I
I traying families with all their com
mon tastes and emotions yet the
former seems to have the edge over ,
j Galsworthy in the matter of ae- !
; curate drawing of individual char- :
j acters and the abilify to make thc;rn |
1 live in all situations.
Finch':; Fortune can be read I
! profitably without the other two ;
( books but the full enjoyment of a |
I completed whole is not possible j
| without reading all three. And he

FINCH'S FORTUNE—By Mazo tie
la Roche, Douhleday l)oran. 19111.
This is the final book in a trilogy
telling the story of the excitable
and exciting Whiteoaks family. For
those who have read Jalna and
Whiteoaks of Jalna a review is su
perfluous since they will read this
book too —that is if they are not

i entirely devoid of all appreciation !
'■ of that which is good.
In this book the author tells the t
tale of the small fortune which falls j
to the lot of the ugly duckling of
1 the family and what he does with :
it, proving in the end that he had i
been the proverbial swan all the
time. Speaking of swans the author 1
i should not allow this book to be i
the sw in song of the Whiteoak fam- '
1 ily. She has made them live so com- (
1 pietely in the mind of the reader j
that it would be more than unfair j
to let them die such an untimely |
j death.
Had dc la Roche preceded Gals- j
worthy ir the eye of the public there
is very little doubt that the White- j
oak saga would now enjoy the same 1
reputation as the Forsyte Saga. 1
