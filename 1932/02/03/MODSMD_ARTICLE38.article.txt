# Knockout Features Middleweight Preliminary Bout
## FRICK STOPPED IN FIRST BY PEREGO; BELL LOSES TILT Insley Gets Decision Over Mathews In Opening Lightweight Go 
### 
One technical knockout and two
closely fought bouts were the fea
tures of the four preliminaries to
the All-University Championships,
which were held yesterday after
noon in the boxing room.
In one of the two middleweight
prelims Jack Perego K.O.'d Don
Flick after less than a minute of
fighting. Perego used a right to the
chin to stop his rival.
Small Man Wins
DeWitt Portal won a close deci
sion ovei Jim Bell in the other
middleweight battle. Bell had a
great advantage in height and reach
but failed to make account of it.
He allowed Portal, a fast, hard hit
ter, to rush him throughout the
three rounds. The loser got in many
heavy punches, but allowed Portal
to sneak in under his guard too
often.
Ed Insley won a close three
round decision over Ben Mathews
in the lightweight division. The two
put "on a good bout to open the
program and the issue was in doubt
until th'? last.
Maloney HI
In the other lightweight bout Carl
Steinhurt won an easy call over
Tomo Ito. The winner was on the
offensive throughout with the ex
ception of the end of the third
round. He started off fast and had
Ito on the run most of the time.
The loser, however, put on a little
show of his own at the end, but too
late to do any good.
Assistant Coach Myron Schall
acted as referee in the absence of
Harry Maloney, who is confined to
his home with a slight cold. The
bouts were witnessed by a crowd
which packed the boxing room.
