# AGED ONE WIELDS HYSTERICAL CLUB
## 
### 
Chuckling over his yeoman work
I with the Hammer of the Society,
the Old Boy announces that Chap
pie's next issue, out Thursday, will
] prove that he can knock things over
\ and make laughs out of every blow.
With several wild swings, he's
banged the new gates into all man
! ner of hysterical shapes, and then,
turning subtle, he's used Ihe sledge
to chisel out a new column on mu
sical entertainment.
The cover may look like a line of
frankfurters from a distance, but
closer inspection reveals a master's
touch. Inside, he takes several raps
at the head of the Board of Trus
tees and a fatherly pat of advice
to the jaw of the Alumnus-who-is-
President.
Through it all, he fills up the
spaces by cracking peanuts and his
eight - pound pile - driver makes
plenty little ones out of big ones,
as the shells pile up in heaps of
I comic epidermis.
