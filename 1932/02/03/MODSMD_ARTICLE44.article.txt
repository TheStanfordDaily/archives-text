STALLING by the U.S.C. Tro
jans is justified by their coach, Sam
Barry, on the grounds that it is
the defensive team that should play
ball. But Caddy Works, coach at
U.C.L.A., throws such an argument
on the ash heap in the following
statement:
"In recent discussions which have
arisen concerning "stalling" some
attempt has been made to place the
blame therefor upon the defensive
team. This is> entirely unfair. The
offensive team by playing ball can
entirely eliminate the practice,
while obviously the team on de
fense cannot refuse to play so long
as the offense attempts to do so.
In other words, the objectionable
situation is only brought about
when the offensive team deliberate
ly withholds the ball from play, an
action for which they and they
alone are clearly responsible. While
it is true that the defense may
break up the stall by coming out.
the fact that they possess the cure
docs not make them responsible for
the disease.
"If the team in possession of the
ball decides to stall that is distinctly
its own business. It is an entirely
different matter, however, when the
offense, ifter adopting an attitude
of "you play my way or I'll take
my ball and go home," then pro
ceeds to blame the defense for the
impasse which may result.
"There is nothing particularly al
trustic about early game stalling.
Its sole purpose is to compel the
drawing out of the defense in order
that the team in possession of the
ball may profit through the result
ant weakening of the defensive re
sistance. and it is only resorted to
by teams which feel more confident
of their ability to maneuver against
scattered defensive units than in

tiie inability to operate against a set
defense in position. This being the
case tin' defense would be exceed
ingly foolhardy were it voluntarily j
(o disintegrate every time the of- i
fense held the ball and refused to
play il. This, of course, is self-evi- ;
dent despite the thinly veiled
sophistry of arguments to (he con- '
trary.
"From the standpoint of the do- I
fense the question of whether or not j
it shall abandon its selected posi- !
tion and force the play depends en- |
tirely upon the score and the time
left to play, a matter which the j
stalling offensive team comprehends i
perfectly. If the spectators can I
realize that the responsibility for |
creating the entire situation obvi- (
cusly rests with the team which i
withholds the ball from play they
will have no difficulty in placing the ;
onus where it belongs.
"Drawing out the defense late in i
the game, of course, is a legitimate j
operation and does not lead to in- j
action for then the defensive team, I
due to lack of time, must come out |
and force the play and the spec- <
tators continue to get their money's j
worth.
"It is regrettable that Pacific Coast j
basketball is apparently faced for ;
the fir,-;t time with a problem which ,
has vitally affected the well-being j
of the game in other sections. The J
spectators are entitled to action and \
as far as three of the four teams in j
the Southern Division and of the
Pacific Coast Conference are con
cerned they will continue to get it
as they have in the past."
AND THAT, MR. BARRY, ought
to hold you for awhile.
