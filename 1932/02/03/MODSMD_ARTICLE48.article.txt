# BRONG AND MENLO QUINTETS WILL BE NEXT FROSH FOES
## Santa Clara Babes Favored Over Indian Squad In Mid-Season Tilt 
### 
The freshman basketball season |
leaches its halfway point this after- {
noon. Three and a half weeks have j
elapsed since the yearlings played I
their fust game against Palo Alto '
High, and just three and a half j
weeks remain before the Papooses!
and the Bear Cubs engage in the j
final battle of the Little Big Series. ]
But Coach Vance Fawcett's imme- j
ciiate concern is two real battles j
against Santa Clara frosh and Menlo j
Junior College teams on Friday and |
Saturday nights.
Broncs Long Odds
The Santa Clara Broncs wound ,
up a fine early-season record last j
week with a 31-18 victory over the j
same San Francisco University frosh :
quintet that had defeated the Indian j
babes 28-13 on the previous eve- i
ning. The latter game, however, was i
not a real test of the relative ability j
of the two teams, since the Indian '
quintet was obviously off form. |
Fawcett's men showed signs of ;
coming out of their Friday slump j
on Saturday against Lowell, but i
they were not quite good enough to i
take the San Francisco champs.
Laboratories robbed Fawcett of !
two of his mainstays yesterday, Tom ;
Sales and Gordon Mallatratt. Sales, j
being too late for basketball prac- j
tice, raited the hopes of Bill El- |
lington's freshman trackmen by ,
jogging around the track several ;
times, but although a hurdler of
prominence, Sales will probably be
back in the fold for the two week
end games.
Yesterday's practice scrimmage
had Crowe, center, Rothert and
Coiner, forwards, and Savage and
Butte, guards, on the first five. A
reserve five composed of A1 Pago,
center, Jim Trompas and "Spindles'
Weaver, forwards, Johnny Mack
and Jake Butts, guards, showed
good form scrimmaging against the
"freshman varsity."
