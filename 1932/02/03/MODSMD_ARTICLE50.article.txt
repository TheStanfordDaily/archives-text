# Prospects Good For 1932 Track Outlook
## Hables Brothers Together With Ben Eastman And Dan Murphy Present Formidable Array

Robert Lyman Templeton of 11
! Stanford University owes his inter- 11
national reputation as a track coach j 1
i to his ability to handle men and \1
not figures. At the same time, Dink J:
has enough knowledge of higher i 1
| mathematics to know that one cap- j:
I tain of what promises to be a great !
j Stanford track team plus one i
j world's record-holder equal plenty ji
j much Indian strength in the quar
ter-mile.
The captain, who at the present i
j time is getting athlete's foot at the '
! Palo Alto Hospital instead of on j
, the track, is Alvin Hables. The |
i world's champion, now studying for
j mid-terms, is Ben Easlman. The
! two, who rank among the nation's
j best, promise plenty of woe to Stan
! ford opponents.
Originally Sprinter
Captain Hables came to Stanford
j as a sprinter, and when he arrived,
I learned that the 440 is considered a
i sprint by Templeton. So Ike forgot
J his high-school marks of :10.1 in
j the 100 and :22.2 in the 220, and
decided to become proficient at run
! ning quarter-miles.
I In the very first year at his new
i task, Hables succeeded to the ex
i tent of setting a new Little Big
1 Meet record at :50.2. Ike was cap-
I tain of the freshman team and is
j one of the few men who have re
| peted as varsity leader.
As a sophomore, Ike ran one of
j the best of all of his races when he
| defeated Maynor Shove, Vic Wil
liams, rnd Art Woessner in the
j California Intercollegiates. Hables'
ilime was :48.4, and he would prob
ably have placed in the 1.C.4-A.'s !
that year had his legs been able to '
stand the long trip east.
Competition Strong
The present captain ran between j
48 and 49 seconds in every race in j
j which he competed last year, and j
i yet hi.3 record of wins is not im- j
! pressive because of the competi- j
tion. In the California Intercollegi- j
j ates, for example, Plables ran two- j
j tenths of a second faster last year i
than ho did in 1930. and could get |
1 no better than fifth. Ike ran :48.1 in ;
| the 1.C.4-A.'s and was seventh; he i
i would have won with that time the j
1 i year before. Hables did win the j
P.A. A. championship, finished third j
in the Big Meet, and was second in ;
the Olympic Club and L.A.A.C. j
I meets.
One of the most important rea- |
j sons for Hables' unfortunate pre
dicament was Ben Eastman. It is al- |

most unnecessary to mention East
man's accomplishments; even his
various unbecoming nicknames rate
headlines. Eastman crashed the first
sports pages when he ran :48.1 as a
freshman, and has been there ever
since.
Eastman Record
In his first year of collegiate
competition, Ben did nothing more
than tie a fifteen-year-old world's
record in the 440 and come within
a second of the world's mark in an
event—the 880 —in which he had
never competed until lust season.
Eastman ran his best quarter-mile
in the California Intercollegiates,
where he beat Vic Williams and
recorded an official time of :47.4.
Back in about 1915, Ted Mere
dith of Pennsylvania ran 440 yards
in :47.4 seconds around one turn,
and experts said it would never be
equalled. Eastman not only equalled
it, he made his mark running
around two turns. In the 1.C.4-A.'s
at Harvard last spring, Eastman's
arch lival —Williams—turned the
tables on Ben but was also forced
I to tie the record to do so.
Expectation High
Eastman's career as a half-miler
began when Templeton decided that
his existant crop of 880 men needed
a bit more ripening. An agreeable
gent, Eastman verified Templeton's
good judgment by winning the 880
in the 1.C.4-A.'s, tlu» U.S.C. meet,
pnd in fact every time he ran. East
man's best mark is 1:53, and he will
probably break that as well as the
world's 440 and 880 records some
time this season.
Lies Hables, who in this series of
I articles is being considered as a
| sprinter, is good enough in the
I quarter-mile to be able to beat al
j most any college runner except
j Eastman. Les has been officially
| timed in :48.1, and he has broken
i 48 flat on more than one occasion,
I Of the rest of the quarter-milers,
! Dan Murphy appears to have an
! edge. Murphy was the ace of last
1 year's freshman 440 men, and an
| chored the relay team in the Little
j Big Meet that recorded the good
I time of 3:27.3. Dan also finished a
j short yard behind Wyke of Cali
fornia in the 440 itself. Murphy re
j corded about 52 flat last year, and
; has already run about that this sea
; son. li he can recover from the
i numerous injuries that have been
I bothering him, he should stand a
good chance of making the relay
| team.

Eastman Record
In his first year of collegiate
competition, Ben did nothing more
than tie a fifteen-year-old world's
record in the 440 and come within
a second of the world's mark in an
event—the 880 —in which he had
never competed until lust season.
Eastman ran his best quarter-mile
in the California Intercollegiates,
where he beat Vic Williams and
recorded an official time of :47.4.
Back in about 1915, Ted Mere
dith of Pennsylvania ran 440 yards
in :47.4 seconds around one turn,
and experts said it would never be
equalled. Eastman not only equalled
it, he made his mark running
around two turns. In the 1.C.4-A.'s
at Harvard last spring, Eastman's
arch lival —Williams—turned the
tables on Ben but was also forced
I to tie the record to do so.
Expectation High
Eastman's career as a half-miler
began when Templeton decided that
his existant crop of 880 men needed
a bit more ripening. An agreeable
gent, Eastman verified Templeton's
good judgment by winning the 880
in the 1.C.4-A.'s, tlu» U.S.C. meet,
pnd in fact every time he ran. East
man's best mark is 1:53, and he will
probably break that as well as the
world's 440 and 880 records some
time this season.

Originally Sprinter
Captain Hables came to Stanford
j as a sprinter, and when he arrived,
I learned that the 440 is considered a
i sprint by Templeton. So Ike forgot
J his high-school marks of :10.1 in
j the 100 and :22.2 in the 220, and
decided to become proficient at run
! ning quarter-miles.
I In the very first year at his new
i task, Hables succeeded to the ex
i tent of setting a new Little Big
1 Meet record at :50.2. Ike was cap-
I tain of the freshman team and is
j one of the few men who have re
| peted as varsity leader.
As a sophomore, Ike ran one of
j the best of all of his races when he
| defeated Maynor Shove, Vic Wil
liams, rnd Art Woessner in the
j California Intercollegiates. Hables'
ilime was :48.4, and he would prob
ably have placed in the 1.C.4-A.'s !
that year had his legs been able to '
stand the long trip east.
Competition Strong
The present captain ran between j
48 and 49 seconds in every race in j
j which he competed last year, and j
i yet hi.3 record of wins is not im- j
! pressive because of the competi- j
tion. In the California Intercollegi- j
j ates, for example, Plables ran two- j
j tenths of a second faster last year i
than ho did in 1930. and could get |
1 no better than fifth. Ike ran :48.1 in ;
| the 1.C.4-A.'s and was seventh; he i
i would have won with that time the j
1 i year before. Hables did win the j
P.A. A. championship, finished third j
in the Big Meet, and was second in ;
the Olympic Club and L.A.A.C. j
I meets.
One of the most important rea- |
j sons for Hables' unfortunate pre
dicament was Ben Eastman. It is al- |

most unnecessary to mention East
man's accomplishments; even his
various unbecoming nicknames rate
headlines. Eastman crashed the first
sports pages when he ran :48.1 as a
freshman, and has been there ever
since.
Eastman Record
In his first year of collegiate
competition, Ben did nothing more
than tie a fifteen-year-old world's
record in the 440 and come within
a second of the world's mark in an
event—the 880 —in which he had
never competed until lust season.
Eastman ran his best quarter-mile
in the California Intercollegiates,
where he beat Vic Williams and
recorded an official time of :47.4.
Back in about 1915, Ted Mere
dith of Pennsylvania ran 440 yards
in :47.4 seconds around one turn,
and experts said it would never be
equalled. Eastman not only equalled
it, he made his mark running
around two turns. In the 1.C.4-A.'s
at Harvard last spring, Eastman's
arch lival —Williams—turned the
tables on Ben but was also forced
I to tie the record to do so.
Expectation High
Eastman's career as a half-miler
began when Templeton decided that
his existant crop of 880 men needed
a bit more ripening. An agreeable
gent, Eastman verified Templeton's
good judgment by winning the 880
in the 1.C.4-A.'s, tlu» U.S.C. meet,
pnd in fact every time he ran. East
man's best mark is 1:53, and he will
probably break that as well as the
world's 440 and 880 records some
time this season.

I articles is being considered as a

I quarter-mile to be able to beat al
