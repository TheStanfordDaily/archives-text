## Barbara Collins Portrays Dominant Woman 
### 
At tryouts yesterday afternoon
Barbar i Collins was chosen to play
the role of Hortensia in the next
Dramatic Council production, "The
Mistress of Briony," by Harold Hel
venston, who is directing the play.
Hortensia is described as having
a commanding personality—"a sort
of Governor General, Mother Su
perior, and political boss rolled into
one —a Catherine the Second of
Russia without any of Catherine's
redeeming vices."
Previous Work
Miss Collins last appeared on the
campus stage in the 1931 Football
Gaieties. She played the role of the
Prima Donna in the opera number.
Before that she was the Duchess of
Devonshire in "Berkeley Square,"
and had a leading part in "The
Mistress," a one-act presented by
the classes in directing and acting
last year.
Hortensia was the only character
cast definitely yesterday, other roles
will be announced today by Hel
venston. The first rehearsal will
start tonight at 7 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall. In general the try
out was successful, a great number
turning out for every role. There
are seven main women's parts, and
six men's, as well as two minor
roles tf) be cast.
First Production in U.S.
11. H. Munro, who wrote the "Mis
tress of Briony," is better known
by his pen name as "Saki." The
play was originally produced under
the title, "The Watched Pot." Its
production at Stanford will be the
first in America.
The play is described by "Saki"
as being an absurd farce. There is
no starring part and all characters
are important in the extremely hu
morous story.
The results of yesterday's tryouts
will be seen on the Green Room
bulletin board today.
