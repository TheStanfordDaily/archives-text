# CARDS HOPEFUL AS FULL SQUAD FACES TROJANS
## LaCombe Back To Guard Berth As Coach Bunn Drills Offensive INDIANS SEEK REVENGE Edelen Expected To Handle Delayed Offensive 
### Bob Wade 
With the Southern California
games just 48 short hours in the
iuture, and his varsity still very
much an unknown quantity as far
as its personnel goes, Coach John
Bunn last night once more moved
LaCombe to the guard berth in
place of Phil Baker.
It begins to look as if Bunn had
answered the scoring power versus
defensive ability question for him
<■ elf by going on record in favor of
the former. Stanford is going to try
a lot of shots at the basket when
the Indians tangle with those loiter
ing Trojans from Exposition Park.
To Try More Shots
Besides trying a lot of shots, the
Indians should be able to make a
lot of them good, if having the
squad's best scorers all in the game
al once will do it. With Meade or
Cosgrove and Cordry as forwards
Bunn has his trickiest and besyt men
available for the positions all on
deck at the same time, and the team
will have lost no punch on the at
tack by shifting the flying "Frenchy"
to the guard post.
The squad is once more intact with
the return of Edelen to the ranks,
although Cordry still has to keep
that injured leg out of Ihe way.
Bunn Stresses Offense
Bunn seems to have practically
decided to start LaCombe in the
backeourt, and if this proves to be
the case, Stanford is a cinch to play
an offensive game for much the bet
ter part of the evening.
If this is the sort of game that
the Indians will have to plav, they
should be at their best. Cordry al
ways lo( ks fastest when the "beeg,
strong fellers" try to keep the ball
away from him. And little Tommy
doesn't let anyone's reach bother
him when he feels that they have
had the ball long enough. No one
who hadn't seen Cordry play would
believ -• that he was big enough to
play on anybody's varsity basketball
outfit, but the fact remains that
when Cordry is out the team looks
as if the ball game was the thing
least interesting in the world to all
of the members.

play on anybody's varsity basketball
outfit, but the fact remains that
when Cordry is out the team looks
as if the ball game was the thing
least interesting in the world to all
of the members.
With the Southern California
games just 48 short hours in the
iuture, and his varsity still very
much an unknown quantity as far
as its personnel goes, Coach John
Bunn last night once more moved
LaCombe to the guard berth in
place of Phil Baker.
It begins to look as if Bunn had
answered the scoring power versus
defensive ability question for him
<■ elf by going on record in favor of
the former. Stanford is going to try
a lot of shots at the basket when
the Indians tangle with those loiter
ing Trojans from Exposition Park.
To Try More Shots
Besides trying a lot of shots, the
Indians should be able to make a
lot of them good, if having the
squad's best scorers all in the game
al once will do it. With Meade or
Cosgrove and Cordry as forwards
Bunn has his trickiest and besyt men
available for the positions all on
deck at the same time, and the team
will have lost no punch on the at
tack by shifting the flying "Frenchy"
to the guard post.
The squad is once more intact with
the return of Edelen to the ranks,
although Cordry still has to keep
that injured leg out of Ihe way.
Bunn Stresses Offense
Bunn seems to have practically
decided to start LaCombe in the
backeourt, and if this proves to be
the case, Stanford is a cinch to play
an offensive game for much the bet
ter part of the evening.
If this is the sort of game that
the Indians will have to plav, they
should be at their best. Cordry al
ways lo( ks fastest when the "beeg,
strong fellers" try to keep the ball
away from him. And little Tommy
doesn't let anyone's reach bother
him when he feels that they have
had the ball long enough. No one
who hadn't seen Cordry play would
believ -• that he was big enough to
play on anybody's varsity basketball
outfit, but the fact remains that
when Cordry is out the team looks
as if the ball game was the thing
least interesting in the world to all
of the members.
