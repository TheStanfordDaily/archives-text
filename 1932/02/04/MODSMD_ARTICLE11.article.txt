# MURAL LEAGUE LEADS TIED UP
## Phi Psi's Favored To Dump Defending Champs 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Round II of the intramural cage
tournament closed last night with
the D.U. quintet holding the only
undisputed leadership, that of
League 11. At the present standing
each of the other six leagues show
a two-squad tie for high honors.
Although defending champions
and having already won two fairly
played contests, the Sigma Chi out
fit seems to be headed directly for
its only defeat at the hands of a
sure-shooting basketball team be
longing to Phi Kappa Psi. The lat
ter's famous 60-4 trouncing of the
Chi Psi five seems to point toward
the mural championship this season.
Both organizations are in League I.
No games are to be played until
Monday, according to Gene Mires,
and that evening both of the above
quintets take on weakened oppon
ents. However, the games will show
just how much the mural teams
have improved in form since the
poor passing which featured Round
I.
