### 
With the selection of Dorothy
Tully io take the part of Clare Hen
nessey, Kathleen Hatfield as Sybil
Bomont, Martha Slayton as Agatha
Clifford, Eph Engleman as Rene St.
Gall, and Barbara Collins as Hor
tensia, the cast for "The Mistress
of Briohy," Dramatic Council's next
production, is almost complete.
Dorothy Tully will be remembered
for her sterling characterization in
Noel Coward's "The Young Idea,"
as well as her other parts in such
plays as "Berkeley Square" and
"The Adding Machine." As Clare
Hennesey, she is described as being
"a rattling good sort in her way.
Again a very charming woman."
Kathleen Hatfield carried the part
of a maid in "Berkeley Square" and
did a very neat interpretation. Eph
Engleman is the man who made
such a tremendous hit as Master of
Ceremonies for the Football Gaie
ties of last year. Rene St. Gall, whom
he portrays, has been described as
"a dilletante. . . . and a rather
charming sponger."
Martha Slayton, the one new
comer Lo the group of experienced
and versatile actors, promises an
interesting interpretation of the
part of Agatha Clifford, "good-na
tured, easily imposed upon." A few
roles have yet to be picked.
