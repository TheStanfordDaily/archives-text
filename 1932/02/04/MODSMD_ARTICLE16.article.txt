# Show Last Proofs At Watson Studio
## 
### 
The Watson Studio will open
again tomorrow and Friday for the
final showing of proofs of all pic
tures taken to date. This is the last
opportunity for students to choose
proofs for individual pictures to go
in the Quad.
Proofs for the law fraternities
photographed last week are now
ready, and it is important that they
be called for. The studio will be
open from 1) to 12, and from 1 to
4:30 o'clock.
