# Senorita Iturbi Likes Stanford

### COLLIER CONNELL 
A young Valencian, Paris-reared,
slender, bright-eyed, who "jus' loff
to drive beeg cars," and thinks
"Shee-ca-go" is the fanciest town
in the United States.
This was the new trick pulled out
of the Concert Series bag for the
benefit of blurb-weary reporters,
whose job is to push a way into the
Pavilon dressing-room.
Senorita Maria Iturbi, fourteen
years old, with the poise of a debu
tante, and the naive charm of any
immigrant girl seeing America for
the fir: t time—this was Jose Iturbi's
daughter, perhaps the least excited
auditor among a thrilled audience 1
of collegians that jammed tin- Pa
vilion iast night. The Senorita will

| soon graduate from a finishing |
I school in Paris, and looks forward i
! with no little zest to entering an
j American campus in time for the
| next football season.
Laughing, interested, hand-wav- i
ing, la Senorita Iturbi insists thai
j she is "an old-fashioned" girl. She ,
: plays tennis, but dislikes it; loves
cold weather, though born in the
i south of Spain. "Sunshine is too
J lazy . . . The elaborate film (
' palaces of America make the biggest
j hit with her.
Joe Iturbi, kissing the ladies'
| hands with creditable grace, took
time out to express appreciation for
, a "culturally disciplined' Stanford
1 audience. I

"All American audiences show
real appreciation," he declared.
"They come to the concerts with
ears, eyes, and soul alert. In Eu
rope they go critically—with a gun."
The ft.-tried Spanish pianist (who
looks hi: healthy role of an amateur
boxing enthusiast) delivered a sig
nificant. comment.
"America is the best country in
every way for art of all kinds. In
every small town, as well as huge
New York, the audiences are of the
same receptive sort."
When told thai Stanford harbored
500 co-eds, Iturbi flung up his all
potent hands and cried "What! 500
women, and you are not crazy, not
yet?"
