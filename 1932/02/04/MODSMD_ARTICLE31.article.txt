# CAMPUS DANCES FOR CAMPUS PEOPLE
## 
### 
In yesterday's Daii.v, the Bullsessioner, Abe Mellinkofl",
advanced some ideas concerning the depression dances
that certainly hit the bullseye.
These dances were designed primarily to promote social
intercourse within the campus community at a minimum of
cost and so far have been very successful in accomplishing
that end. However, one danger to future success of the
movement became appar"ut with the arrival at Saturday's
dance of a goodly number of people, anxious to take ad
vantage of inexpensive entertainment, at the same time
having no connection with the University.
Mellinkofl' suggests a practicable solution to the prob
lem which would require the presentation of student body
cards by the men for admission to the dances. There would
lie no point in requiring this formality from the women
because there is already a dearth of women and a few im
ports ought to be welcome.
Think it over, (lampus dances for campus people makes
a fine slogan.
