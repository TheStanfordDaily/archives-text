# EDITORS COURAGEOUS
## 
### 
W'lien Wiliis Duniway, editor of the Orcyon Emerald,
student newspaper at tile Kugene institution, decided he
didn't care to endorse editorially the "Dime Crawl" spon
sored by the women <> 1 the university, he meant just that.
So when a hunch of the hoys at Oregon who thought the
women's dance was a good idea sent Duniway an anonym
ous letter threatening to throw him in the lake if he didn't
quit crilici/ing. Duinway called the bluff by publishing a
facsimile of the letter in the lime raid with an invitation to j
"the boys'' to come out into the open.
Latest reports do not indicate whether Duniway was
thrown into the lake, whether the threatening youths folded
up, or what, but at all events. Duniway deserves the praise
of every college editor for the courageous manner in which
lie met that emergency.
