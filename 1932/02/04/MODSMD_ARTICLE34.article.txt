# BULL SESSION
## A 						WHITE ELEPHANT IN THE FACULTY'S LAP 
### 
Crusaders make life interesting, j i
It is they who accomplish things in *■
the realm of public affairs. It is easy j |
I to mock them; but when they are ; i
i
I sincere, it is very hard to beat them. - c
i In college where the "Murad" has
j supplanted all other emblems and
; where the only reason people want <
j the winds of freedom to blow is so (
| that their pipes will burn more t
readily, it is difficult to be crusad- i
J ing. Consequently, after our fashion, I
we have supported the Honor Court- t
I cil in their work to make the Honor i (
i Code live. 11
1
Yet with Chairman Hand's recent j
! denunciation of the faculty and the t
administration as two causes of the j |
; present plight of the Honor Code, i i
I we can have no sympathy. It is not j s
that, we like the faculty more and ! c
i Hand less—but after all one hates t
, to witness the dropping of the thing j j
on anybody's doorstep except where 1'
|it belongs—with the students. The i
j Code is for us; we enforce it; and j
i if it is a success we will pat our
i ielves on the back for being able to i r
get along without faculty supervi- c
j sion. To blame the faculty if the i
, thing fails is most unsportsmanlike, cc
c
The professors can neither make 1 1
or break the Code. It may be sad (
: to admit but it is nevertheless true i
that those who lecture have rela- j i
tively little effect on the student's j t
notions, especially those relating to ]
: campus affairs. Whether they can <
\ even change prejudices in the field I 1
in which they are teaching is a very j

moot point. It the class mocks the
Code, the professor who attempts to
praise ii will be mentally scorned,
and perhaps, a few souls in the
back of the room will even utter
an obscure snicker.
The natural pugnacity of the stu
dents will be aroused. And on the
other hand if the students favor
the Code, they will be strengthened
in their belief by an attack on it
by some humorous professor. So in
either case, whatever the professor
does or does not do will matter
lit'tle. And if it is true, as Milton
Hand slates, that little things like
professors making students write
the pledge before the exam rather
than after —if statements like ask
ing the students to take alternate
seats—if such trivial stuff can weak
en honor in examinations, then it is
high time to take the Honor Code
from the students, from the faculty,
from the administration, and drop
it in the bay.
There are only two things that
make people act honorably—their
character (a vague psychological
composite) and the fear of getting
caught. The latter is up to the stu
dents; and the former cannot be
blamed on the faculty. If the Honor
Code is a white elephant, and there
is evidence that it may assume such
proportions, the students must nurse
the creature, change its color, or
perform white elephanticide. We
cannot drop the thing on the col
lective lap of the faculty.
