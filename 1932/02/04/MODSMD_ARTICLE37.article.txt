THE TRAVEL TALES OF MB. I
JOSEPH JORKENS — B> Lord
Dunsany. G. P. Putnam's Sons.
New York, Loudon, 1931. (At
"j the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Mr. Joseph .Jorkens, traveller ex
traordinary, sits by the fire at the
Billiards Club and, his memory
aided by numerous whiskeys ,re
; counts tall tales in so convincing
'a manner as to make the doubter
i leel guilty of heresay.
Ther« it the story of Mrs. Jorkens,
| who was on exhibition at a hotel in
Aden, and the story of the exhibitor
I of apes and what befell him when
he was lost in the jungle. We find
out what happened to Mr. Jorkens
when he went hunting the abu
laheeb, a mysterious animal who in
j habits the papyrus of the upper Nile |
{ and who has one peculiar bond with
! man. We'll guarantee you never
' heard of him before.
• | Lord Dunsany is very refreshing
1 : after all the practical, matter-of
i fact people who take to writing,
especially since lie does not descend
jto whimsy. He is simply slightly 1
I mad in a fashion that makes his
i readers leel it is much the best state
' of mind. —F.J. 1

! 1 TONIGHT OR NEVER—At the New
, | Menlo Theatre, Menlo Park.

( ' Always the dazzling, radiant star,
, | Gloria Swanson rises to new heights
! r.s Nella Vago, temperamental prima
n donna, in "Tonight or Never."
The plot begins in a romantic
canal of moonlit Venice, proceeds
from there to Budapest, and comes
j to a last climax when the formerly
r harsh prima donna finds love and
_ a contract to sing in New York.
e She went alone at night to keep a
0 rendezvous with life and fun. but
£ Fate played a hand and united her
heart with that of the young Ameri
can. The plot moves fast at the start
and during the later scenes, but for
y a considerable portion of its de*-
-s velopment it is rather boresome.
- j On the whole it is very good, but
e 1 only because superb ability covers
i over the deficiencies of the plot

A Bruce Bartel comedy and a tech- •
nicolor travelogue complete a fairly j
good bill. —J.H.G.

DR. JEKYLL AM) MR. HYDE—At
the Varsity Theatre.

Murmurs of "Have you seen it?" i
could be heard, here and there, on j
the sidewalk from the theatre down j
University to the Circle yesterday j
after the show. "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. j
Hyde," as a talkie, is exceedingly ;
horrible, realistic, and well put to
gether—there are no weak spots. [
Fredric March handles the dual- j
personality characterization in a j
masterly fashion. He shows himself j
1o be capable of doing heavy roles \
as well as the dashing army cap
tain, the dusky gigolo, etc.
The film follows Stevenson's novel
very closely but everything that
does not tend to the single vivid |
effect of horror is omitted. This is
allowable and is thoroughly appro
priate on the screen. —E.T.P.

EMMA—At the New Stanford.

Marie Dressier crashes through
with the ultra-superlative of all of
her successes when she stars in this j
picture, without an exception the j
best we've seen since heck was a j
pup. It is beautifull done in every j
detail, including exactly the right
amount ol humor and pathos, noth
ing slapstick, nothing weepish—just j
right. j
Emma, as housekeeper, acting- j
mother, and chief confidant of a
motherless family leads a hectic life
full of cares and worries, and gives
Dressier a perfect opportunity to do
her stuff.
It can be truly said that Marie ,
has won a claim to the title of j
"America's Sweetheart" and has
given it a new and deeper meaning.
See thu picture whether you have
a mid-quarter tomorrow or not.

Temple's comet will be closest to j
the earth about the middle of next J
November and will offer an inspir- !
