# FAMED ITURBI TRRILLS CROWD
## Simplicity The Keynote Of Varied Program 
### 
Showing rare musicianship and
highly developed technique, Jose
Iturbi entranced an unusually at
tentive and appreciative audience in
the Pavilion last night. Extreme
modesty and entire lack of the
mannerisms so often found in con
cert artists characterized the Span
ish virtuoso. Indeed, he appears
more like the boxer he is in his
spare moments than a musician.
Playing with wrists of steel, yet
fingers of velvet, Iturbi opened the
concert with two sonatinas of Scar
latti. Clearness and fluency charac
terized his playing throughout.
Iturbi is capable of producing won
derful shadings in his music, cli
maxing exquisite pianissimo with
brilliant fortissimo.
Playing Delicate
No over-sentimentality is found
in his interpretations. His playing
was more delicate and gracious than
emotional. Iturbi does not strike one
as being feverish and excitable.
La Campanella of Paganini-Liszt
received special commendation from
the audience. In this piece the
Spanish pianist displayed a splendid
technique, playing the treble trills
and runs with incredible rapidity
and producing a delightful liquid
tone.
Beethoven's Sonata in A flat ma
jor, Opus 110, and Mozart's Sonata
in A major, No. 9, were superbly
done. Iturbi ably distinguished the
individuality of the two composers.
"L'lsle Joyeuse" by Debussy, the
painter of dreams, was indeed a
happy dieam as played by Iturbi.
As encores, the Spanish pianist
offered two etudes by Chopin, two
waltzes, one by Chopin and one by
Brahms, and a Spanish dance by
Albeniz, all of which received long
applause.
