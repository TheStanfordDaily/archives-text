Old Jupc Pluvius stepped into the ,
picture last Saturday to catch up \
on his neglected duti^ —annually i
raining out the Stanford-Olympic j
Club baseball game. He missed the j
first one, but is probably expecting !
to catch up on some of the games !
to come.
But the playful old gent can't !
keep the willows indoors forever,
and with a new season just around I
ihe corner, the hot-stove league is
already in heated discussion as to |
Ihe merits of the prospective mem- j
bers of Coach Harry Wolter's 19321
edition, defending champions of the j
California conference.
• '♦ •
Last year Wolter had a pitching
j-lafF that boasted just one depend
able hurler. This year he has been ;
deprived of that chucker's services
already—at least until the spring
quarter.
On the other hand he has a
fine prospect in Stan Anderson,
of last year's mediocre fresh
man outfit; a lot of material in
Caddel, Estes, Cooper, and
Stark. We classify them that j
way because none of them have
pitched enough to rate any j
comment—yet. Although in the j
case 0!' Caddel it is merely a
question of getting control. In
his first game Ernie looked as
if he might be getting just that.
We hope so!
The receiving department has
three or four members, but only;
< no of them has an arm that would i
do justice to a varsity team. And if |
you think there is anything more j
demoralizing than having them pil- |
for bases at leisure on your catch- j
1 rs, send it in! The one in question
is Livermore from last year's win- 1
ning team, and he looks to be a j
cinch for the post unless someone j
new appears, or some of the ailing j
arms get better rapidly. Massey, a j
sophomore, is the most likely sub- I
titute, but he lacks experience and j
is troubled with a sore arm.
✓v >v >
Wolter's infield has been gone j
over, both verbally and in print, so |
often that the fans are completely |
at loss for answers to the riddle of j
"who is going to play first and'
third." The only thing that one can
do is settle back and let Harry
figure it out. Second base is ade
quately taken care of by Vince
Philippi, with Holmes, Hall, and 1
Triplet! in reserve.
Shortstop is also well cared
for by Bert Delmas, with no j
one in sight yet as a substitute.
Although in a pinch Wolter
could shift Maentz from third
back to the short patch. In the
outfield the Indians have two
lettermen, a promising sopho
more. and a wealth of reserve
material.

It is too early in the season to I
predict that the Stanford nine is a j
cinch for the championship. In fact, *
judging by last year's close race, i
ihe Farm will have to turn out an
awfully good outfit if they expect i
to even stay in the race. But with j
the material that is on hand, and
with the possible addition of a little
material from the basketball squad,
and the return of the star pitcher 1
r.ext quarter, Stanford ought to be 1
able to give any claimants to the i
championship quite an argument. j
