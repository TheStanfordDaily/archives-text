# STANFORD FENCERS WILL TRY SKILL IN A.F.L. SEMI-FINALS
## 
### 
Moving the scene of battle from |
this campus to San Francisco, the j
Amateur Fencers' League of Amer- j
ica will hold the next of its weekly |
meets, the individual open foils
championship, at the Olympic Club, t
This will give Stanford's fencers a j
chance to travel this week-end, the !
meet being scheduled for Friday j
evening at 8 o'clock.
Since the meet is open and is in j
no way a team affair, any amateur ;
athlete residing in the Bay District i
:s eligible to compete. It is prob- ;
able that at least six members of ;
the Indian squad will try out their
trusty right hands and arms Friday, !
for the evening's winner becomes j
eligible for the Pacific Coast finals. ;
John Ferguson, who upset many :
of the peninsula's best fencers in j
last week's matches, will be the i
most formidable of the Stanford en
tries. Captain Leonard Pockman,
who, according to form should give
Ferguson the most competition,
probably will not fence.
Dick Criley, the present number
three man of Stanford foils artists, !
will be present and should be right i
up among the leaders. The fourth j
man on last week's three-man team j
—Fred Fearman—plans to make the !
trip, as do A1 Snyder, Jim Reed, and i
Fed Sheedy.
