## 
### 
Seven hits and seven runs, which
followed one lone walk, were all
that A1 Earl's All-Stars needed to
give the Stanford varsity baseball
team its first setback of the season !
when I hey emerged on the long end |
of an 8-5 score.
After pitching one-hit, one-run j
ball for four innings, Stan Anderson I
blew up in the fifth and handed the j
visitors the ball game on a silver 1
platter. Except for this one frame, J
the Red? hirts should have won an j
easy game.
Having given away one hit and I
one run in the first half of the !
opening inning, Stanford came right !
back with three hits and two runs, j
for an advantage which they en- j
joyed until the fatal fifth. Even with |
the score 8-2 against them the In

dians managed to pick up a run in j
the last of the fifth, seventh, and
eighth innings, but the damage had i
already been done.
Harry Stark took up the mound !

J tried so far, but it is doubtful if •
! any of them are in condition to >
j pitch a full game yet.
I The hitting honors were shared !
! by Goldman, Delmas, Rintala, Miles, [
i and Philippi, with a brace of hits I
j apiece. Philippi collected the first I
j real extra-base blow of the year
I when he tripled in the eighth with j
the bases unoccupied.
