# TRUCK MEN START YEAR WITH SQUAD MEET TOMORROW
## Sprinters And Shot-Putters Promise Competition; Ike Hables Sick 
### 
Competing against each other for
no other reason than to get in bet
ter condition and to furnish San
Francisco newspapers with copy,
Stanford's tracksters will swing into
action for the first time this quar
ter tomorrow afternoon in a prac
tice ni'.-et. The affair will serve to
show just which of the men have
been taking their training seriously,
as well as giving coaches Templeton
and Ellington some idea oj the ac
tual and not paper strength of the
team.
Particular interest will be centered
en the shot-put and the dashes.
Four of the five best collegiate shot
putters in the country will meet
tomorrow, and George Grey, Nellie
Gray, Here Laborde, and John Ly
man should force one of their num
ber out around 49 feet.
There is a chance that Les Hables,
Ben Eastman, Ralph Giberson,
Frank Lombardi, and Jimmie Will
son will all meet each other for the
first time in either the 100 or the
220, and if they do another event
of national championship calibre
will be presented for the fans. In
addition, A1 Blackman of the frosh
will be in there, and his threat must
be considered.
The longer races are all being run
at three-quarter distances. In the
352, which will replace the 440, Roy
Hundley and Will Harwood will
it out for first, unless Eastman
or Les Hables decided he needs a
bit of exercise.
The rest of the quarter-milers are
in various stages of ill health, Cap
tain Hables leading the way with an
unknown lung trouble that has him
confined in the hospital. Morse Guit
tard is at home on a leave due to a
bad throat, and Dan Murphy's leg
has not yet completely regained its
strength.
Stanford's national champion dis
cus-thrower—Bob Jones by name—
also will probably not compete to
morrow. Jones has a sore shoulder
that has prevented him from work
ing out for a couple of weeks.
