# Frosh Hoopsters Meet Fast Santa Clara five
## 
### 
Santa Clara frosh, boasting one ;
of the strongest teams in Pacific !
Coast freshman basketball circles,
invades the Farm Fi iday night, de
termined to add Coach Vance Faw
cett's Stanford yearlings to its ever- !
growing list of victims. Not content i
with one hard struggle a week, the 1
Indians return to the Pavilion Sat- -
urday night, meeting the California j
Coast championship five of Menlo j
Junior College.
I
The Papooses will "shoot the ;
works" on Friday night against j
Santa Clara, as a victory over the !
Bronco yearlings would push the '
Indian babes back into public at- j
tention. The Santa Clarans defeated j
the San Francisco University fresh- i
men, 31-18, and turned in several i
other creditable victories.
Although Menlo lost a formidable j
array of stars from their victorious j
1931 quintet, including LaCombe, |
Cosgrove, Norgard, and Tod, Coach |
Uud DeGroot's team seems on its '
way to another junior college title '

as a result of two overwhelming
victories over the strong Moran
Junior College team.
Friday will probably find the
Papooses lining up as follows against
Santa Clara: Crowe, center; Roth
ert and Charles Coiner, forwards;
Mallatratt and Butte, guards. Henry
Coiner, Frank Cox, and Jim Savage
are likely to see action, as a result
of good work in this week's practice
sessions.
