# POWERFUL RADIO TRANSMITTER TO BE OPENED HERE
## Stanford To Be In Contact With All Parts Of World, Claim 
### 
Stanford will soon be in contact j
with all parts of the world as a
result of a high-powered radio I
transmitter which has been built by
graduate students in the electrical j
engineering department. It is ex
pected to have the transmitter in j
operation by next week.
Paul Byrne, one of the engineers,
lias a similar instrument located at
Redwood City with which he has \
had contact with London, Paris, |
North Africa, Hawaii, Australia, j
New Zealand, and several South
American countries. He also re- ;
cently received a card from Siberia
saying his message has been re- j
ceived.
One of the most valuable features j
of the instrument is that it can b« j
used with voice as well as key. This
is made possible by an inch-square I
piece of quarts .03 of an inch thick, j
This piece of quartz controls the I
frequency of the transmitter, hold- I
ing the frequency constant and'
making possible perfect modulation.
Without perfect modulation the voice
would be blurred and indistinguish- |
able. This feature is one of the :
latest developments in radio trans- j
mission
As soon as the instrument has I
been put in opei'ation a meeting of
the Stanford Radio Club, for whose j
use it was built, will be called to ;
arrange for its use. A schedule of
stations will probably be arranged,
the stations being called at a definite j
hour each week.

here by Ruth Donaldson, Minne
apolis. and Helen Jeuson, former
show girls, at Glad Tidings Taber
