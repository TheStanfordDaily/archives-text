# CACTI COVERED AS SEARSVILLE FLOWS INTO ABORETUM

### 
With Searsville filled to its capa- I
city of 305,000,000 gallons, Lagunita ,
overflowing, the water level in Felt i
lake rapidly nearing the top of the ■
spillway, and a torrent of water j
running down San Francisquito
creek to the Bay, Stanford is as
sured of an adequate supply of
water during 1932.
Felt lake, with a capacity of 315,-
000,000 gallons, will be filled within
a few days if the current storms
continue, and will overflow within !
ten days if sunny skies prevail, it |
was announced yesterday by James i

W. McDonnell, assistant superin- J
tendent of buildings and grounds. It j
will be the first time since its con
struction in the summer of 1929 that
Felt lake has filled. The storm which '■
prevailed from December 21 to 28 i
contributed 170,000,000 gallons to the •
25,000,000 already stored in Felt |
lake, and sent 540,000,000 gallons;
raging down Son Francisquito 1
creek.
Part of the overflow from Sears- '•
ville is being piped to the arboretum '
and used to flood the ground be
neath the trees. During the past I

week approximately 6,75,000 gallons |
were so utilized. It is not known I
what effect this flooding has on the ;
water table, which is at the" present ;
time 150 feet below the surface of j
the ground.

Overflow from Lagunita is being j
used to flood the United States De- j
partment of Agricultural Experi
mental Orchard on Governor's I
Lane. According to McDonnell, the '
drainage of Lagunita, which usually j
occurs in May, will probably be de- j
layed this year if heavy rains con- !
tinue to fall during spring quarter, j
