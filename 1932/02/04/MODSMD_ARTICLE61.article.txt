# WEESNER DEFEATS PETTERSON TO GAIN FIFTH NET RANKING
## 
### 
Climbing up into fifth position on
the varsity tennis ladder, Chuck
Weesner humbled Kelsey Petterson
in 6-0, 6-2 fashion Monday. Petter
son was fourth until last week,
when he bowed to Chuck Otis in
straight sets, falling to fifth place.
Weesner, sixth, challenged him
Monday, and pulled somewhat of a
surprise by his easy victory. Little
has happened recently in the ranks
below the first ten, but Butler and
Gordon, eighth and ninth men re
spectively, are scheduled to meet in
Ihe near future to decide eighth
position. The loser is to play Ellis,
now number ten.
The team has had no opportunity
t otest its power as yet this season,
last Saturday's matches with the
strong California Tennis Club outfit
having been postponed until the
fourteenth on account of rain. This
first chance will come Saturday,
however, when the first six racquet
men will face the Burlingame Ten
nis Club in as many singles en
counters on the Burlingame courts.
