# VISITING ORGANIST TO PLAY FRANCK MUSIC
## 
### 
In his recital this afternoon at
5:10 o'clock in the Stanford Me
morial Church Charles L. SafTord,
visiting organist, will play several
selections of special interest from
the works of Cesar Franck.
Franck was born of destitute
parents a short time before the
French Revolution. Probably no
composer of his rank met with so
little recognition at the hands of his
contemporaries. The difference in the
quality of his best work and his
poor work is remarkably wide,
which may, in part, account for his
unpopularity. Also, at that time the
public taste in music was at low
ebb; Paris cared for little but opera,
and that of the most superficial
type.
