# FILIPINOS ABANDON INDEPENDENCE HOPE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3. (£>)—' The I
decision of the Philippine Demo- J
crata party to dissolve has caused |
complications in the insular legis- !
lative commission, now in Washing- j
lon on an independence mission, j
which may lead to withdrawal of i
the two minority party leaders.
"The Philippine question," Sena- j
tor Montinola said, "cannot be |
solved 10,000 miles away. If the j
Filipinos want independence they
should give our mission their full i
confidence and support. Only the |
Hawes and Hare bills have any I
chance of consideration by Con- j
gress.''
