ASK THE MAN WHO'S
DANCED THERE
He'll tell you that the States
Hof Brau is the one place in
the Bay Region where you can
have one real good time —good
food, a marvelous dance or
chestra — a peppy college
crowd—atmosphere—without
its costing you your week's
allowance.
THERE'S NO COVER CHARGE AT THE
STATE'S HOF BRAU AT ANY TIME
Whether you come for dinner
t(and its delicious and costs j
only $1.25 per plate) or just j
for an after the theatre drink,
this still holds good.
