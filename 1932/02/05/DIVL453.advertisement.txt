SUN-CURED
VIRGINIA
is one of the fine tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS
Founder of the blend
Sun-cured Virginia is the to
bacco in COLONEL ADAMS
mixture which accounts for
its unusual mildness.
The soil and suinshine of Vir
ginia ripen this tobacco to a
golden-yellow color, then il
is cured by a drying process
in the sun.
This cures the leaf to a na
tural mildness impossible in
any other tobacco.
Like all the tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS our Vir
ginia Leaf is aged 4 to 5 years
before packing.
That's why COLONEL AD
AMS is mild and sweet, and
doesn't bjte your tongue like
unseasoned tobacco.
