# Stanford After Troy Scalps On South Invasion
## Bunn Expects "Delayed Offense" if Trojans Gain Lead; Cards to Use Same Attack Against Stalling That Was Used in Previous Series TWO CARD WINS WILL PUT U.C. IN LEAGUE LEAD LaCombe Starts at Guard, Payne Palmer Takes Over Vacated Forward Post; Cordry to Play 
### DICK RODDA 
WELVE members of the Stanford basketball team got out their com
mute tickets last night to make the second trip within a week to Los
Angeles, this time to take on the league-leading U.S.C. Trojans in a pair
of games tonight and tomorrow night at the Olympic Auditorium.
The Indians lost a couple of games to the Trojans in a hard-fought
series here three weeks ago and ever since "revenge" has been uppermost
in the minds of these twelve cagers. If they get their revenge, they will
also topple the Trojans from the conference lead, providing California

comes through twice this week-end*
against U.C.L.A. at Oakland.
Starting Lineup
After shifting his men around all
week during practice, Coach John
Bunn finally announced a definite
starting lineup against Troy last
night. Packard will open at center,
Cordry and Palmer will start at the
forwards, and LaCombe and Nor
gard will be at the guard posts.
That LaCombe would probably be
shifted to guard has been known all
week, but the name of Payne Palm
er at one of the forwards is some
what of a surprise. Palmer has seen
action in games this year but has
improved enough lately to prove to
Bunn that he is capable of filling
LaCombe's shoes in the scoring de
partment.
The rest of the men who made
the trip last night are: Doub, cen
ter; Hancock, Baker, Edelen, and
Tod, guards; and Meade, forward.
Cards Polish Offense
"Stanford will use the same at
tack against the U.S.C. stalling play
that was used here," said Bunn last
night before the team departed.
"The Trojans will be harder than
ever to beat but we will give them
plenty ol competition."
Bunn sent the boys through an
easy practice yesterday after giving
them the "works" for the first part
of the week. Foul shots, passing, and
fundamentals were polished off. j
The Trojans are expected to use
their usual stalling tactics if they
get the lead or if the Indians give
them a chance as "Elevator" Sam
Barry has not yet been convinced
that the spectators come to the game
to see basketball.
"Nemo" Favored High Scorer
"Nemo" Nemer, Troy's scoring
ace, will probably be high-point
man, getting most of his baskets via
free throw stealing. Gardner will
again team with him at the other
forward, with Capps and Bescos
ready to perform the statuary act
under their own basket as guards.
Either Pierce or Erskine will open

at center. Picrce has been receiv
ing the call most of the time but
last w?ek Barry used Erskine in the
second game with the Bears which
apparently brought results.

The Stanford squad departed for
the South last night on the Lark
and will return to the campus Mon
day morning on the Sunset Limited.
