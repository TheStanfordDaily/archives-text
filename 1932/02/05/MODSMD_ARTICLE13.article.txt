# SENATE BATTLE ON DOLE LOOMS
## Republicans Will Oppose Substitute Bill For Jobless Relief 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4. (/P)â€”'The
Senate today squarely faced the
troublesome issue of spending gov
ernment money to help Jhe jobless
and took action preparatory to q
direct vote on a proposal that $375,-
000,000 be appropriated for this
purpose.

Without objection, the La Follette-
Costigan bill to bring this about
was made the order of business.
The acquiescence of the Adminis
tration Republican group, was taken
as an indication it is confident of
defeating the proposal when the
final vote arrives. President Hoover
is an outspoken opponent in direct
federal relief.

The outlook was dismissal for a
substitute measure proposed by the
Democratic leadership. This would
have $750,000,000 appropriated, one
half of the amount for road con
struction and the other for loans to
states to be devoted to relief work. |
When the substitute is brought to
roll call, the Republican Independ- j
ents of the West who are backing |
the LaFollette-Costigan measure, j
will vote with the Republican regu- j
lars against it. Several Democrats I
have bolted the party leadership on |
this question and may be expected j
to vote with the Republicans.
Statistics reveal that sixty former
college athletic heroes are now
presidents of colleges and universi- ;
ties in the United States. j
