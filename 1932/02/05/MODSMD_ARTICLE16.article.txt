# Pop Warner Outeats Jim Rolph 3 to 1 In Peanuts
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Sunny Jim—one.
Pop Warner—three.
This was the per capita ratio of
1 peanut consumption by two of Cali
[ fornia's top-notch notables who sat
j munching, side by side, in seats of
t honor at last night's boxing matches.
Governor James Rolph, Jr., in cut
away coat and Ascot tie, ruddy face
I beaming above a starched and spot
: less shirt front; Coach Glenn S.
Warner, hunched in tan checked
| overcoat, familiar to every devotee
'of the practice grid field; and these
two attracted a pair of lions' share
of the Pavilion's interest.
Cornered by a reporter as he de
scended the bleachers, California's
chieftain extended a warm hand
clasp, beamed with extraordinary
gusto, and declared himself de
; lighted with the whole evening.
"It was wonderful," he smiled. "I
felt this to be really fine amateur

| "What do I think about this whole
business of college? Why, I think
these tine young men have the
greatest opportunity in the world
before them. Here they are, getting
their preparation in the golden state,
with all the economic possibilities
j you can imagine before them. Here
we are in California, fronting the
j ocean, across which lie nine millions
iof people which spell—Commerce.
This is the day of vast commerce—
why else do you think gigantic
steamships are being launched each
week?"
i "College training is absolutely
necessary to the successful man to
day," declared Governor Rolph.
"The day of the self-made man is
gone."
And so saying, Sunshine Jim
| Rolph, friend of Stanford, dusted
his immaculate cuffs with a linen
kerchief and was escorted out into
the rain.
