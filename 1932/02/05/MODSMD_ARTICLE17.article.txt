# JAP ARTILLERY BATTERS DOWN SHANGHAI AREA
## Mile-Long Fire Sweeps Sky As Chinese Wait For Desperate Push 
### 
! SHANGHAI (Friday), Feb. 5 (/P).
I â€”Tlie devastated Chapei section of
Shanghai was churned and battered
by another heavy Japanese bom
bardment today, but its Chinese dc
: fenders still clung to the barricaded
j strongholds they had set up amidst
I the ruins.
Judging from the thunder of the
I guns the Japanese were using six-
I inch projectiles in their effort to
! blast the Chinese out of their posi-
I tions in the northern section of the
| city.
This new artillery assault followed
! two major bombardments yesterday
which left the Chinese holding fast
to their holes in the ground.
Bombardment Flares
The heavy shelling started 40 min
-1 utes after midnight. Shells exploded
at the rate of one a minute, rattling
: the doors and windows of houses
| three miles away.
After an hour the heavy guns
1 ceased firing, but three-inch pieces
: and machine guns were kept in ac
j tion. At 3:15 a.m. quiet descended
j on the battlefield.
A wall of fire a mile long lighted
[ the sky over Chapei. Smoke and
; fumes from the conflagration were
j swept down on the International
i Settlement by a cold north wind,
i The Chinese looked for a final des
! perate push on the part of the Jap
j anese to clear out the last strong
; hold in Chapei before many more
hours.
Japs Fire College
Tse Chin College, a well-known
Chinese school in the Japanese
occupied district of Hongkew, was
. destroyed by flames early today.
1 Chinese said the Japanese entered
' the four-story dormitory of the
school and set fire to the furniture
and then put the torch to the insti
tution's other two buildings.
Fresh detachments of the United
i States Marines, brought in on the
Cruiser Houston, took their places
:in the International Settlement
guard line.
