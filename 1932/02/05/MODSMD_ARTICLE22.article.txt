# Visiting Orators Argue Economic Relief Question
## Attentive Audience Hears Spirited Debate 
### 
Convincing an attentive audience I
that Milwaukee produces polished
orators as well as superior beer, i
Bob Hansen and Louis Stauden
maier, debaters from Marquette
University in the Wisconsin city, ;
argued a solution of the economic :
depression in a forensic encounter
with Stanford held yesterday after- '
noon in the Little Theatre.
Representing Stanford on the
negative side of the question, "Re
solved, That Congress should enact
legislation providing for the cen
tralized control of industry," Rollin
Woodbury and Herbert C. Sander- .
son, attempted to show that gov- j
ernment interference in the business
field would be impractical.
Industry Asleep
Stating that "industry was not
only resting on a rock, it was sound
asleep there," Staudenmaier opened
the case for the affirmative. The j
second Marquette speaker, Hansen j
declared, "A force outside industry,
a government board similar to the
National Labor Board established |
during the war would prevent ex- j
ploitatinn of labor and would be an 1
effective solution of the present ]
crisis."
Replying as first speaker of the !
negative, Woodbury stated, "Be- j
cause of the multiplicity of the j
causes of depression, governmental j
control of industry would be inef- :
fective." Stanford's other speaker, j
Sanderson, pointed out, "The graft
and corruption evident in govern- j
mental bodies would be increased j
under centralization of industry."
The debate yesterday with Mar- 1
quette is the second time that Stan- j
ford has met the mid-western uni- j
versity on the forensic platform. The j
first contest was in 1927.
