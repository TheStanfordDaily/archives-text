# JAROFF ORGANIZED FAMED CHORUS IN RED PRISON CAMP
## 
### 
Sergo Jaroff, the diminutive but
dynamic leader of the Don Cossack
Russian Male Chorus, which will
present a program of all-Russian
songs in the Pavilion Wednesday
night, first organized his far-famed
group of singers around the camp
fires of the Russian Imperial army.
All the members of the chorus
were in General Wrangel's White
Army. When this army was de
feated, they were sent to the prison
camp of Tschelengir, near Constan
tinople, where Jaroff, the "half
pint" Cossack, continued to train
his six-foot companions in their
nightly singing of native songs —
songs of a country which they have
little hope of ever seeing again.
The ihree dozen members of the
chorus are Russian, refugees—men
yithout a country —■ traveling on
"Nansen" passes, issued by the
League of Nations for those who
have no country to call their own.
