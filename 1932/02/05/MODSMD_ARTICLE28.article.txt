1 )ear Sullv:
These past several years it has been customary for the
outgoing editor to til! the edit column with what is known
as "an open letter to the new chief." It is a horrible habit,
because the outgoing keypounder is very likely to get very
.sentimental and hand out a great deal of guff that he would
never think of uttering' it' he did not know that never again
could he be held responsible for what appeared in the
1 )au.v.
You may infer from the foregoing introduction that I
don't think much of "open letters." You are right, but don't
for a moment think you are going to escape one. Oh no,
my boy.
Yes, it is with a lump in my throat that I turn over the
reins of the Daily to you, JSiIT. However, the aforesaid
lump is not so much the product of a deep regret at leaving
such a pleasurable place as the Daily, as it is the result of a
deep sympathy for the unsuspecting youth who is about to
project his center board into the open spaces where some
.'l,lOO members of the Associated Students of Stanford I'ni
versitv can and will take a crack at it.
You will find, Sully, that you can never be more than
half right, and that only on rare occasions. If the students
like the Daily, the administration will think it is rotten.
If the administration likes it, then you may be certain that
it will be far 100 dull for the students to care much for it.
If you adopt a policy of praising most things, the campus
will stamp you as lily-livered. If you are critical, you will
get the reputation of being a sour-minded oaf who never
had a good word for anyone. The best thing you can do is
to grope for the happy medium and be careful you don't
lose a hand in the process.
Seriously, though, there are a lot of things you must
fake a stand on, and tit least two crises are hard upon you.
The., first is the matter of depression among the students
and the Daily is in a strategic position to do the campus a
great deal of good. The second is the question of the Honor
(lode and whether it is working or not. Volume SO of the
Daily kept away from that last subject almost completely,
because the present Men's Council was earnestly striving
to accomplish something. They have had time to experi
ment now; it is up to you to judge whether they have suc
ceeded.
Then there are the old stalking-horses—Pan-llellenic,
Dean Yost, the junior colleges, farcical student government,
rushing, and so on. The Daily will refer to them often, be
cause each of them represents a situation or a condition
that screams to high Heaven for correction. You yourself
cannot effect a change, but perhaps you can make the stu
dent body think about it.
Last, but not least, comes Ihe question of the Daily's
lfi-ccnt increased allotment from the A.S.S.I". You will
have to fight a hostile student body president and student
manager, but no matter what their arguments may be, they
can't controvert the fact that the students are now paying
f.O cents every quarter lo pay for a basketball pavilion that
was finally paid for last fall. The f>o cents is there to aid
student activities; the Daily needs a part of it, and the
Daily deserves to gel it. Keep pounding.
Keep in mind this one thing in most cases, the humor
ous shaft is far more effective than the vehement one. It
would have been well had I remembered that always; as
it is,1 am passing on to you Ihe information gained from
sad experience.
Remember this, also. 1 p in the Journalism building is
a man who has seen half a hundred Daily editors come and
go, who has been a Daily editor himself, and who has
piloted many a fire-eating youth through stormy waters.
I lis name is Kvcrett Wallace Smith and whether he lauds
or damns your brain children, you will know you are
gelling a square deal. When in doubt, see K. W.
You have under you a line collection of newspapermen.
Your editorial board and your crew of night editors are as
good iis any in history. With that sprightly pair, Jack
Jernegan and Harry (or is it Stew?) Crawford as associ
ates, Ihe scholarly Helen Thomas as woman's editor and
the sanguinary Rawson Holmes as managing editor, you
won't have a great deal lo worry about.
One thing more, Willie. Make the most of every mo
ment. because it doesn't last as long as you think. February
to June it seems an age now, but it is really just an inter
lude. In no time, you'll be sitting down to write just such
Itipe as this and you will be feeling just as limp, just as
much out of the middle of things, as 1 do now. Lots of luck.

DICK.

1 )ear Sullv:
These past several years it has been customary for the
outgoing editor to til! the edit column with what is known
as "an open letter to the new chief." It is a horrible habit,
because the outgoing keypounder is very likely to get very
.sentimental and hand out a great deal of guff that he would
never think of uttering' it' he did not know that never again
could he be held responsible for what appeared in the
1 )au.v.
You may infer from the foregoing introduction that I
don't think much of "open letters." You are right, but don't
for a moment think you are going to escape one. Oh no,
my boy.
Yes, it is with a lump in my throat that I turn over the
reins of the Daily to you, JSiIT. However, the aforesaid
lump is not so much the product of a deep regret at leaving
such a pleasurable place as the Daily, as it is the result of a
deep sympathy for the unsuspecting youth who is about to
project his center board into the open spaces where some
.'l,lOO members of the Associated Students of Stanford I'ni
versitv can and will take a crack at it.
You will find, Sully, that you can never be more than
half right, and that only on rare occasions. If the students
like the Daily, the administration will think it is rotten.
If the administration likes it, then you may be certain that
it will be far 100 dull for the students to care much for it.
If you adopt a policy of praising most things, the campus
will stamp you as lily-livered. If you are critical, you will
get the reputation of being a sour-minded oaf who never
had a good word for anyone. The best thing you can do is
to grope for the happy medium and be careful you don't
lose a hand in the process.
Seriously, though, there are a lot of things you must
fake a stand on, and tit least two crises are hard upon you.
The., first is the matter of depression among the students
and the Daily is in a strategic position to do the campus a
great deal of good. The second is the question of the Honor
(lode and whether it is working or not. Volume SO of the
Daily kept away from that last subject almost completely,
because the present Men's Council was earnestly striving
to accomplish something. They have had time to experi
ment now; it is up to you to judge whether they have suc
ceeded.
Then there are the old stalking-horses—Pan-llellenic,
Dean Yost, the junior colleges, farcical student government,
rushing, and so on. The Daily will refer to them often, be
cause each of them represents a situation or a condition
that screams to high Heaven for correction. You yourself
cannot effect a change, but perhaps you can make the stu
dent body think about it.
Last, but not least, comes Ihe question of the Daily's
lfi-ccnt increased allotment from the A.S.S.I". You will
have to fight a hostile student body president and student
manager, but no matter what their arguments may be, they
can't controvert the fact that the students are now paying
f.O cents every quarter lo pay for a basketball pavilion that
was finally paid for last fall. The f>o cents is there to aid
student activities; the Daily needs a part of it, and the
Daily deserves to gel it. Keep pounding.

and the Daily is in a strategic position to do the campus a
great deal of good. The second is the question of the Honor
(lode and whether it is working or not. Volume SO of the
Daily kept away from that last subject almost completely,
because the present Men's Council was earnestly striving
to accomplish something. They have had time to experi
ment now; it is up to you to judge whether they have suc
ceeded.
Then there are the old stalking-horses—Pan-llellenic,
Dean Yost, the junior colleges, farcical student government,
rushing, and so on. The Daily will refer to them often, be
cause each of them represents a situation or a condition
that screams to high Heaven for correction. You yourself
cannot effect a change, but perhaps you can make the stu
dent body think about it.
Last, but not least, comes Ihe question of the Daily's
lfi-ccnt increased allotment from the A.S.S.I". You will
have to fight a hostile student body president and student
manager, but no matter what their arguments may be, they
can't controvert the fact that the students are now paying
f.O cents every quarter lo pay for a basketball pavilion that
was finally paid for last fall. The f>o cents is there to aid
student activities; the Daily needs a part of it, and the
Daily deserves to gel it. Keep pounding.
Keep in mind this one thing in most cases, the humor
ous shaft is far more effective than the vehement one. It
would have been well had I remembered that always; as
it is,1 am passing on to you Ihe information gained from
sad experience.
Remember this, also. 1 p in the Journalism building is
a man who has seen half a hundred Daily editors come and
go, who has been a Daily editor himself, and who has
piloted many a fire-eating youth through stormy waters.
I lis name is Kvcrett Wallace Smith and whether he lauds
or damns your brain children, you will know you are
gelling a square deal. When in doubt, see K. W.
You have under you a line collection of newspapermen.
Your editorial board and your crew of night editors are as
good iis any in history. With that sprightly pair, Jack
Jernegan and Harry (or is it Stew?) Crawford as associ
ates, Ihe scholarly Helen Thomas as woman's editor and
the sanguinary Rawson Holmes as managing editor, you
won't have a great deal lo worry about.
One thing more, Willie. Make the most of every mo
ment. because it doesn't last as long as you think. February
to June it seems an age now, but it is really just an inter
lude. In no time, you'll be sitting down to write just such
Itipe as this and you will be feeling just as limp, just as
much out of the middle of things, as 1 do now. Lots of luck.

1 )ear Sullv:
These past several years it has been customary for the
outgoing editor to til! the edit column with what is known
as "an open letter to the new chief." It is a horrible habit,
because the outgoing keypounder is very likely to get very
.sentimental and hand out a great deal of guff that he would
never think of uttering' it' he did not know that never again
could he be held responsible for what appeared in the
1 )au.v.
You may infer from the foregoing introduction that I
don't think much of "open letters." You are right, but don't
for a moment think you are going to escape one. Oh no,
my boy.
Yes, it is with a lump in my throat that I turn over the
reins of the Daily to you, JSiIT. However, the aforesaid
lump is not so much the product of a deep regret at leaving
such a pleasurable place as the Daily, as it is the result of a
deep sympathy for the unsuspecting youth who is about to
project his center board into the open spaces where some
.'l,lOO members of the Associated Students of Stanford I'ni
versitv can and will take a crack at it.
You will find, Sully, that you can never be more than
half right, and that only on rare occasions. If the students
like the Daily, the administration will think it is rotten.
If the administration likes it, then you may be certain that
it will be far 100 dull for the students to care much for it.
If you adopt a policy of praising most things, the campus
will stamp you as lily-livered. If you are critical, you will
get the reputation of being a sour-minded oaf who never
had a good word for anyone. The best thing you can do is
to grope for the happy medium and be careful you don't
lose a hand in the process.
Seriously, though, there are a lot of things you must
fake a stand on, and tit least two crises are hard upon you.
