# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
You can have too much of a good
thing. You can have too much of a
bad thing. The Democrats usually
have too much of both at four-year
periods. Every Democratic governor,
.senator, or ex-cabinet member con
siders himself a potential presiden
tial possibility. Even when the
Bourbons know they are doomed to
defeat, there are plenty of people
willing to bear the party standard
in defeat. Now, when they have a
chance to win, candidates have the
habit of bobbing up at every con
ceivable opportunity, with annoying
and persistent consistency.
Ever since it became evident in
1930 that Roosevelt was sure to be
a candidate in 1932 because he had
swept New York by hundreds of
thousands of votes, people have
been talking about Newton D.
Baker. As "Time" might say, Ohio's
Newton is chiefly remembered as a
Secretaray of War who didn't try to
be the Napoleon of the American
armies. On the eve of a great attack
Newton asked General John Persh
ing if he could do anything. Said
John to Newton, "Pray for fog."
Newton prayed. The fog came. That
of course is not Baker's sole claim
to fame.
The Ex-Secretary of War under
Wilson has consistently denied that
he was a candidate. Every time he
makes a denial, he makes a speech
however; and this continues to keep
his name where he wants it—not in
the spotlight but very close to it.
A recent statement proves beyond
a doubt that he would accept the
nomination if offered him. Always a
strong advocate of the League of
Nations, he now would not lead the
U.S. into this organization until a

BAKER—THE COY

majority of the people favored such
action.
Only a politician makes state
ments like that. He implies, in short,
that he won't talk about the League
until it is advantageous to do so.
For a man whose sole aim is to
garner votes, that is sound policy;
for a man who merely desires to be
a citizen of the land that is a most
unfortunate statement. Everybody
knows the U.S. can't enter the
League without a congressional
vote. The President can only use
pressure. He should use it to lead
the people to something he con
siders right rather than bowing to
the opinions of the majority.
And if that sentiment were not
bad enough for a citizen and good
enough for a presidential possibility,
he also feels that the League of Na
tions should not be made a "parti
san issue." Why not? It is a political
matter. The trouble is that it will
lose votes and no votes should be
lost. Men who want the presidency
above all else want to take every
controversial problem out of poli
tics. It has recently been advocated
by various politicians that the
tariff, prohibition, economic relief—
all these should be taken OUT of
politics.
Yes, take all the issues—what few
there are—out of politics, and then
candidates can speak exclusively on
such meaningless political nothings
as "patriotism," "better homes,"
"great founders," and the like. Then,
perhaps, we wouldn't even have to
have campaigns—just alternate the
presidency between the two parties
—like 3 to one.
