Woncler how a basketball player i
I ever keeps his egotism going, when i
football teams on their trips noi'th
and south are accompanied by hun
dreds of blood-thirsty — at least
thirsty—lndian rooters? John Bunn's
contingent is off to the Sunny South,
j once again, to try putting USC in i
its proper place, only you'd never
know it except for the absence of a
! few impressive youths at week-end
rushing parties.
We'vo just heard a story that one
of you might laugh at, while we're j
1 talking about football and basket
ball too. During Christmas vacation,
' when the hoopsters were all ma- '
rooned on campus, a brawny youth
J who doubles up on his sports was I

I introduced to a typically lovely
j Castilleja miss.
She looked him over, cooing
softly, and said. "I just know
I've seen you before! ....
Aren't you on the varsity foot
hall squad?" He admitted it.

played basketball, too.
"Oh!" (with dreadful disap
pointment) "I thought you were
an athlete . . . ."
We wonder what's become of the
| famous Toyon Caucus that every

1 our youth. Maybe they're still there,

I names in this thing called nomina
: tions. Is't possible, Chlotilda, that
i we may yet openly elect somebody
: that we like, every year or so, or
( are we day-dreaming?
Out of the mass of conflicting
reports from the transpacific war
zone, we gather that the next
logical candidate for the presi
dency of China is Dr. Fu Man

Don't be too astounded at any
undue noise coming from the Theta
Delt house tonight. Daily staffsters
! are holding their semi-annual ban
quet, pnd the sight of a would-be
! fellow-journalist with a necktie and
! clean hands may strain someone's
nerves —you never know.
This habit of losing things in
Lagunita is rather wearing, and
a habit usually to be deplored.
But Kiunor says that someone
lost a heart out there one after
noon this week, and as a result
we may have an announcement
of an engagement at the Tri Delt
house any year now.
