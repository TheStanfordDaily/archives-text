Woncler how a basketball player i
I ever keeps his egotism going, when i
football teams on their trips noi'th
and south are accompanied by hun
dreds of blood-thirsty — at least
thirsty—lndian rooters? John Bunn's
contingent is off to the Sunny South,
j once again, to try putting USC in i
its proper place, only you'd never
know it except for the absence of a
! few impressive youths at week-end
rushing parties.
We'vo just heard a story that one
of you might laugh at, while we're j
1 talking about football and basket
ball too. During Christmas vacation,
' when the hoopsters were all ma- '
rooned on campus, a brawny youth
J who doubles up on his sports was I

I introduced to a typically lovely
j Castilleja miss.
She looked him over, cooing
softly, and said. "I just know
I've seen you before! ....
Aren't you on the varsity foot
hall squad?" He admitted it.
i hut explained proudly that he
played basketball, too.
"Oh!" (with dreadful disap
pointment) "I thought you were
an athlete . . . ."
We wonder what's become of the
| famous Toyon Caucus that every
| body talked about in the days of
1 our youth. Maybe they're still there,
I and getting just what they want out
I of every election; but there seems

j to be quite a variety of choice and
I names in this thing called nomina
: tions. Is't possible, Chlotilda, that
i we may yet openly elect somebody
: that we like, every year or so, or
( are we day-dreaming?
Out of the mass of conflicting
reports from the transpacific war
zone, we gather that the next
logical candidate for the presi
dency of China is Dr. Fu Man
| elm.
Don't be too astounded at any
undue noise coming from the Theta
Delt house tonight. Daily staffsters
! are holding their semi-annual ban
quet, pnd the sight of a would-be
! fellow-journalist with a necktie and
! clean hands may strain someone's
nerves —you never know.
This habit of losing things in
Lagunita is rather wearing, and
a habit usually to be deplored.
But Kiunor says that someone
lost a heart out there one after
noon this week, and as a result
we may have an announcement
of an engagement at the Tri Delt
house any year now.
