# CLUB BALL TEAM TO MEET INDIANS ON DIAMOND HERE
## Card Battery Selections Uncertain Quantities In Lineups 
### Bob Wade 
Having come out even in the two
games i layed this year, winning
from i lie Olympic Club and losing
to A! Earl's All-Stars, the varsity
baseball team takes on the Athens
Club nine tomorrow afternoon, con
fident of emerging with another vic
tory.
Coach Wolter has released no
starting lineup, but he will probably
send in the same team that has
taken the field for the past games,
with a possible shake-up in the
battery.
The veteran mentor has used four
of his five pitchers already, and it
is a question of using the remaining
one, Wall Cooper, or start over
again on the list. All four of the
chuckers have looked fair consider
ing the newness of the season, in
fact be tier than hist year's crop
looked at this time, but it is still a
very large question as to which one
will stand up best under the strain
of the nine-inning route.
Pitchers Ilated
Taking them one by one: Bob
Estes showed promise in his first
start, but he also showed lack of
experience in varsity competition.
With more games behind him aiiff
a little more speed the youngster
ought to be ;>ble to help the team a
long way toward its second con
secutive pennant.
Ernie Caddel looked better than
last year by one very long way, and
if Ernie continues to show this im
provement, and more control, Wol
ter will have two first-class hurlers;
Stan Anderson had the same old
blinding speed that he exhibited as
a freshman last year, but he looks
as if he needed a lot of work before
facing the tough games that are
coming up.
Harry Stark showed a lot of class
in the four innings that he was on
the mound Wednesday. He has
plenty en the ball, seems to have
absolute confidence in himself, and
except (or a tendency to wildness,
looks to be the best of the new crop.
However, it must be remembered
that he pitched only four innings,
and it was in the fifth that the two
starting pitchers weakened.
Livermore lo Catch
Wolter will probably start "Big
Ike Livermore behind the plate,
and Trautman on third. There seems
to be some question as to who will
hold down the initial sack. Wolter
may give Hearn another chance, or
he may keep Goodell there. Neither
of them has been hitting too well.
Wednesday's defeat cannot be en
tirely blamed on Anderson. If there
must be blame, a good share of it
goes to "the second baseman, who
looked rather badly out of position.
But by tomorrow this should be
ironed out, and the Indians ought
1o chalk up another win.

Wednesday's defeat cannot be en
tirely blamed on Anderson. If there
must be blame, a good share of it
goes to "the second baseman, who
looked rather badly out of position.
But by tomorrow this should be
ironed out, and the Indians ought
1o chalk up another win.
Having come out even in the two
games i layed this year, winning
from i lie Olympic Club and losing
to A! Earl's All-Stars, the varsity
baseball team takes on the Athens
Club nine tomorrow afternoon, con
fident of emerging with another vic
tory.
Coach Wolter has released no
starting lineup, but he will probably
send in the same team that has
taken the field for the past games,
with a possible shake-up in the
battery.
The veteran mentor has used four
of his five pitchers already, and it
is a question of using the remaining
one, Wall Cooper, or start over
again on the list. All four of the
chuckers have looked fair consider
ing the newness of the season, in
fact be tier than hist year's crop
looked at this time, but it is still a
very large question as to which one
will stand up best under the strain
of the nine-inning route.
Pitchers Ilated
Taking them one by one: Bob
Estes showed promise in his first
start, but he also showed lack of
experience in varsity competition.
With more games behind him aiiff
a little more speed the youngster
ought to be ;>ble to help the team a
long way toward its second con
secutive pennant.
Ernie Caddel looked better than
last year by one very long way, and
if Ernie continues to show this im
provement, and more control, Wol
ter will have two first-class hurlers;
Stan Anderson had the same old
blinding speed that he exhibited as
a freshman last year, but he looks
as if he needed a lot of work before
facing the tough games that are
coming up.
Harry Stark showed a lot of class
in the four innings that he was on
the mound Wednesday. He has
plenty en the ball, seems to have
absolute confidence in himself, and
except (or a tendency to wildness,
looks to be the best of the new crop.
However, it must be remembered
that he pitched only four innings,
and it was in the fifth that the two
starting pitchers weakened.
Livermore lo Catch
Wolter will probably start "Big
Ike Livermore behind the plate,
and Trautman on third. There seems
to be some question as to who will
hold down the initial sack. Wolter
may give Hearn another chance, or
he may keep Goodell there. Neither
of them has been hitting too well.
