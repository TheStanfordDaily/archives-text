# NEW HIGH JUMP, POLE VAULT STARS TO ADD INTEREST TO WEEKLY TRACK MEET
## 
### 
! Stanford track fans will watch'
with interest this afternoon the per
, formances of two important recent
additions to the Indian cinder
I squad. They are Penny Austin and
Bill Miller, and, unless the weather
1 intervet.es, they promise plenty of
! entertainment to those who attend
| the weekly practice track meet. j
Austin, whose presence should
I add some much-needed ability in
; the high-jump, will receive his stif—
| fest competition from Don Black
! man, ace of last year's Indian
I jumpers. Owens, Keeble, Clyne,
| and Messimer, of the varsity,
j Schween of the freshmen, and La
! Mont, who is ineligible, should all
help to make this event worth
! watching.

The pole-vault will find Miller
pitted against Bert DeGroot, Ned
Johns, and Buck Van Dellen.
r n the (iGO, which will replace the
lu.lf-mile, Frank Fullenwider should
lead Naylon, deßetteville, Ferrie,
Burch, and the assorted frosh mid
dle distance men to the tape.
At present the two leading high
hurdle-rs are Jack Brugman and
Dean Stallings, and neither will
compete this afternoon on account
of illness. Gus Meier and Woolley
will fight it out for the honors in
the highs, and Cotto Herbert will
probably take the lows.
Bill Werder may enter the broad
jump for the first time since he hurt
his shoulder, and if he does he
should give Wally Butler and Phil
Williams a bit of competition.
