# TOUGH CONTESTS ON SCHEDULE FOR FROSH HOOPSTERS
## Bronco Babes Hold Biggest Threat; Menlo Jaysee Shows Strength 
### Albert Guerard 
With the varsity in Los Angeles
for two contests with "Silent Sam"
Barry's stalling terrors, the Indian
yearlings hold down the peninsula
basketball spotlight this week-end
with two games against Santa Clara
frosh and Menlo Junior College to
night and Saturday.

Tonight's game will bring Faw
cett's quintet against one of the
strongest first-year teams on the
coast, Santa Clara boasts easy vic
tories over the San Francisco and
St. Mary's freshman fives, which in
turn registered victories over the
Papooses. St. Mary's had probably
the best team that Stanford has
faced this season, but the Gaels
were not match for the Santa Clar
ans when those baby Broncos began
kicking up their heels.
Crowe, Coiner, Rothert, Mallat
tratt, and Butte will start.
The Indians will not be on en
tirely strange ground when they
square oil with the Menlo quintet
on Saturday night, as they have
already scrimmaged Dud DeGroot's
championship team several times,
and in each practice session the
Menlans have enjoyed a slight edge.
Menlo Experienced
Coach DeGroot has developed a
real threat in Arne Anderson, a
forward who seems to be coming
into his own in junior.college com
petition. Anderson is aided by four
experienced players, chief among
whom is Audrey Stringer, a guard
who burns up the gridirons in foot
ball season.
Although Fawcett will probably
do a lot of experimenting tonight
and Saturday in view of the second
game of the Little Big Series on
the following week-end, both con
tests should prove torrid affairs,
with the Papooses entering both
games on the short end of the bet
ting, but with an excellent chance
of upsetting the opposition.
