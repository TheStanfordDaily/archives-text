# NANKING APPEALS TO ALL FRIENDLY NATIONS FOR AID
## Manifesto Condemns Action Of Japs; City Returns To Normalcy 
### 
NANKING, Feb. 4. (A')â€”A lengthy
manifesto by local public organiza
tions tonight appealed to "all peace
loving friendly nations," to uphold
justice and fair play in the present
Sino-Japanese controversy, and to
take effective measures to "restrain
Japan fiom her military aggres
sion."
The manifesto also said:
"Japan's insane military adven
tures toward China, more particu
larly her indiscriminate aerial at
tacks on Shanghai and the shelling
of Nanking, not only violate treaties
but constitute dark history in the
twentieth century."
Normal conditions were being re
stored to Nanking today. Train ser
vice to Tientsin was resumed, many
shops were reopening, and a few
refugees were returning. Rice stocks
were large and more was due.
Seriously handicapped by a paper
shortage, the Nanking press was is
suing editions in reduced size, con
taining articles urging the public
to remain calm and giving "lessons"
on how to safeguard itself in case
of a Japanese warship or airplane
attack.
The city was visited by a four
inch snowfall last night.
