# STANFORD FENCERS COMPETE TONIGHT IN OLYMPIC TRIALS
## 
### 
With their eyes focused on place
on the United States Olympic team,
five Stanford fencers will go to the
Olympic Club tonight to compete in
the A.F.L.A. Bay Division open foils
tournament. The winner of this
meet is eligible for the Pacific Coast
finals, and the victorious finalist will
fence in the Olympics.

The squad has the example of its
captain, Leonard Pockman, at which
to aim, as Len has already won the
open saber title. It is extremely
possible lhat John Ferguson will
join Pockman in the finals by win
ning tonight's foils meet.
Ferguson has already defeated
both the Olympic Club's and Cali
fornia's best fencers, and in addition
he is the ranking Stanford foils
artist. If he is in the form he showed
in last week's team foils meeX, Fer
guson should win.
The other Stanford fencers who
will compete tonight include Dick
Criley, Fred Pearman, Burnham
Sheedv, and A1 Snyder.
