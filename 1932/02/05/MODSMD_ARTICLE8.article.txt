# ENGLAND LAYS TARIFF DUTIES
## Commons Ends Century Old Free Trade Policy 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 4 (/P).â€”ln an his
j toric session of Commons today,
Great Britain's free trade policy, the
nation's fiscal cornerstone for a cen
tury, was thrown overboard by Ne
| ville Chamberlain, who wore the
j mantle of his famous father, Joseph,
j as he proclaimed the financial revo
! lution.
On March 1 a general tariff of ten
! per cent will be levied on all British
j imports with the exception of wheat,
j meat, fish, grain, cotton and wool
I under the national government's
S program.
! A tariff commission something like
j that of the United States will be
! established to levy additional duties
i up to 100 per cent.
Preferential treatment for British
j dominions will be worked out at an
i imperial conference in Ottawa in
June, but meanwhile the dominions
will be unaffected.
Existing tariffs such as the present
levy of 33 1-3 per cent on automo
; biles, known as the McKenna duties,
| will remain unaffected as will pres
j ent duties on tobacco, tea, sugar and
j coffee.
