# TOYON FORMAL WILL BE NOVEL
## New Color Scheme, Light Effects To Feature 
### 
Neon signs, black and gold deco
rations, Gordon Heche's ten-piece
orchestra and a limited number of
bids are among the features that
promise to make Friday night's
Toyon formal one of the most suc
cessful of campus dances. Although |
the price of the bids is lower than ,
usual, Toyon Club has voted to use ,
part of the club dues to insure a |
plentiful supply of the dollars that j
make or break a dance.
The campus has already demon
strated its interest in the affair by
purchasing all but about thirty of
the bids. The remaining can be ob
tained at the A.S.S.U. office or from i
Beverly Robinson or Tom Cordry if j
the desire for bids is accompanied I
by $3.50. j
Robinson, chairman of Ihe Toyon \
Dance Committee, guarantees that j
the lighting effects at the dance will j
be superior as well as novel. Joe !
Gordon and Bob Baxter, who are
in charge of the decorations, have '
the best lighting facilities ever as- j
sembled for a campus dance at their j
command. The best of the equip- i
merit sent down for the Eneina for- i
mal, the complete group of spots, j
etc., boasted by Toyon and Branner
halls, as well as several new addi
tions to the campus lighting para
phernalia will be combined to light :
the dance well both quantitatively |
and qualitatively.
Among the plans arc included the !
ideas of playing the lights on a sil- j
ver background and of transforming
the doorway of the Toyon lobby 1
into a window. No potted plants
will be scattered about to make
dancing a hazardous undertaking,
but instead a single group of ferns '
will help prevent ambitious indi
viduals from climbing through the j
closed door.
