# Soviets Mobilize Siberia Troops As "Precaution”
## Jap Forces Pour Withering Gunfire Into Fortresses Blocking General Advance Above Shanghai 
### 
Hp OKYO, Feb. 7. (if*)- —The Japanese consul general at Vladivostok,
Siberia, reported to his government today that the Siberia seaport had
taken on "an atmosphere which may be described like that of wartime"
and that movement of Soviet troops and horses there had greatly increased.
Transportation of munitions, he said, was much in evidence. The mili
tary activities of the Soviet were merely precautionary, the report said.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 7. (/P) —The town and fortresses of Woosung, which j
guard the Whangpo river above Shanghai, drew withering fire from j
Japanese warships, planes, and troops today, but the Chinese apparently ;

• were clinging 1 desperately to (heir
] trenches.
Switching their major operations |
I from shell-wracked and lifeless
j Chapei, the bombardment proceed
j ed until halted by darkness.
The Chinese made feverish prepa
rations to meet the encircling tac- ;
| tics of 'he enemy both at Liuho and k
j in the Woosung area. Liuho, some 25
| miles up the Yangtze from Woo
: sung, which itself is 16 miles north
west of Shanghai proper, was a j
j veritable confusion of trenches and j
j barricades and sand bag walls. Chi- j
I nese reports said the Japanese had ;
| landed troops at Liuho, resulting in j
an outbreak of hostilities in that
! vicinity.
i Major activities of the day, how- |
; ever, centered in a terrific struggle j
[ for the mastery of Woosung, where j
[Japanese troops and bluejackets
! made persistent efforts to bridge I
Woosung Creek and get within !
| striking distance of the forts.
Although it was not clear just i
j where the battle stood when snow j
! and darkness called a halt, the j
I Japanese said they had not crossed !
j the creek and taken the ramshackle j
! town in front of the fori.
j All Chinese civilian life was j
j blasted out of Woosung by Japa- 1
: nese warships today. The entire dis- ;
j trict was pock-marked with shell |
i fire .by four seaplanes and 12 land I
' planes.
. Strings of men, women, and chil- j
dren, clamoring for shelter, strug- j
gled unceasingly in the mud along ;
the Whangpo river front to escape i
the death behind ihem.
Belize, British Honduras, is still |
I seeking ways to house its earth-
I quake homeless.
