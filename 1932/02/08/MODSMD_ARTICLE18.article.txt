# Chinese Show Originality With Business Conditions
## 
### 
The Chinese talent for doing
things sufficiently differently to gain
for China the name of Topsyturvy
dom, has been demonstrated again,
this time by Professor Kreps of the
Graduate School of Business, who
recently returned from a tour of the
Far East.
While the rest of the world has
been suffering from depression, a
large part of China has been enjoy
ing—or rather, was enjoying until
the outbreak of the trouble with
Japan—a period of inflation and
prosperity.
Professor Kreps said that China's
imports had shown a marked in
crease, industrialization was going
forward rapidly, and realty values
and the stock markets had gone
sky-high.
The popular dictum, "Add an inch
to the Chinaman's shirl and you'll
set ill the factories of the world
moving." is quite wrong, Professor
Kreps believes, because there is
nothing which China could give in
return. OpDosini' .mother popular

! opinion, he does not consider China
Ito be a land of tremendous re-
I sources. China offers little oppor
| tunity, ho believes, to sellers of
j western industrial products.
"Most oi China," Professor Kreps
, said, "is so poor that even the corn
i stubble is pulled up "to be used for
fuel."
One interesting feature of the in
; dustrial plants was that they were
| either so modern that they were
almost completely foolproof or so
primitive that they depend solely
upon labor employed in the tradi
| tional Chinese way. There is no
middle ground, he found, because
of the lack of labor that can be
adequately trained.
"Going from Chinese-controlled
lands to Japanese lands, such as
Korea, is like goinjj from night into
day, he asserted. Japan has already
j raised tremendously the standard of
living in Korea.
During his stay in China Profes
sor Kreps was invited to lecture at
i several Chinese universities.
