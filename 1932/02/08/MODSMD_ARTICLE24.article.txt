### 
A special meeting of the* debate
squad will l>e held this afternoon
at 4:!{0 o'clock in Room 2(1!. Abe
McllinkolT and Howard Conn will
debate an ailirmative team from
NVhittier College 011 the centralized
control of industry.
Stating that recent developments
in government attempts to alleviate
the present depression will be dis
cussed in the crucial forensic dual
of this quarter, Leland Chapin,
men's debate coach, has selected
William August Kaye and James
Bednar to meet a visiting debate
team from the University of South
ern California in the Little Theatre
Thursday night at 8 o'clock.
On the same night James Vizzard
and John Huneke will represent
Stanford against >the Trojans at Los
Angeles. According to John Gange,
Stanford debate manager, this is the
first time in several years that the
Trojans and Cardinals have met in a
dual debate.
Good Question
The question for the debate, "Re
solved, that Congress should enact
legislation providing for the central
ized control of industry," is the topic
selected by Pi Kappa Delta, national
honorary debating fraternity, and
has been extensively debated by
colleges and universities throughout
the country. Stanford has already
debated once on this topic, in tht?
debate with Marquette University
held last week.
Representing Stanford 011 the af
firmative side of the debate, Kaye
and Bednar will attempt to show
that the present tendency of gov
ernment interference in business
must lead to some form of central
ized control. The formation of the
gigantic Reconstruction Finance
Corporation is an example of gov
ernment paternalism in industry.
Experienced Men
Both Kaye and Bednar have ex
perienced an extensive debating ca
reer ai Stanford. Kaye was one ot
the three Stanford debaters to meet
the University of California at Ber
keley last quarter. Bodnar partici
pated m four debates last year.
John Huneke, who will represent
Stanford at U.S.C., spoke to a na
tion-wide audience last fall when
Stanford's radio debate with Har
vard was broadcast. Vizzard de
bated against the University of San
Francisco and the College of the
Pacific last year.
