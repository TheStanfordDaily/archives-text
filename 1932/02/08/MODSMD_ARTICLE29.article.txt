# TROJANS TAKE FARM TEAM IN DOUBLE-HEADER
## Indians Lose Third Contest Of Series 35-27; Drop Fourth Tilt 32-19 CORDRY REGAINS FORM LaCombe Breaks Vertebra In Initial Game 
### Bob Wade 
After overcoming a six-point
margin early in the lirst half, and
finishing lhe period leading 11-10,
Stanford's basketball quintet threw
away its ehance to win a game from
the University of Southern Califor
nia Saturday night and went down
under i 32-li) drubbing.
The defeat gave the Trojans a
clean sweep of the four-game series,
shoved the Indians farther into the
conference cellar, and kept the men
of Troy on top of the heap, even
though the Battling Bears from
Berkeley took another contest from
their "little brothers," the Westwood
Bruins.
Stanford made half as many goals
as the victors and three-fourths as
many free throws. Since the Red
shirts had but one less chance at
the easy points, this may account in
part for their overwhelming defeat.
Ledger Even
"Frenchy" LaCombe suffered a
broken vertebra in Friday night s
encounter, and this may have had
something to do with the loss of the
fourth game to the Southerners, but
the Frenchman hasn't been scoring
any too well lately, and "Tiny Tom
Cordry returned to his pre-injury
form, which makes the ledger just
about balanced.
Reports from the South men
tioned nothing about the famous
S.C. "loitering tactics," but they di'l
stress die fact that Stanford scored
just one held goal in the second
half of Saturday's game, which,
edded 1o six free throws, gave them
a grant"? total ol nine points for
twenty minutes of concerted effort.
No Kcal Win
Leaving out the first two victories
of the stason, over a U.C.L.A'. out
fit that had not hit its stride, Stan
ford has not been able to turn in a
lull game at top speed in the other
seven conference contests played to
date. Either the Redshirts have
spotted the oyposition a long lead
in the lirst half and then vainly
tried to overcome the handicap, or
they have taken the first hah' lead
themselves and then crumbled in
th'> lvt'i period to lose the battles
by imposing margins.
In Fiiaay night's encounter villi
El Trojan the score at half time was
18-18, the lead changed hands twice
during the final period, yet the
Cards went down to a 35-27 defeat.
Saturday nighl Stanford led at half
time bv one point, and was beaten
by thirteen points when the fine 1
gun sounded.
Consistent Losers
A San Francisco sports editor io
marked after the recent Bear-Bruin
clashes that he could not figure out
how either team ever managed to
upset the S.C. quintet, which puis
Stanford just about where they are
—in the cellar. It has been a num
ber of years since the Farm laddie,
took a stvies from their Trojan ri
vals; bin the records do reveal the
fact that the Golden Bear has eaten
Indian meat every year since ID2. r >,
wh< never a basketball series rolled
around.
If the Indians intend to upset
either of these records, and they
have already scrambled theii
chances to smash one of them, they
will have to show not only better
basketball than they have so far,
but they will have to develop the
ability to play A-l ball for the full
40 minutes.

of the stason, over a U.C.L.A'. out
fit that had not hit its stride, Stan
ford has not been able to turn in a
lull game at top speed in the other
seven conference contests played to
date. Either the Redshirts have
spotted the oyposition a long lead
in the lirst half and then vainly
tried to overcome the handicap, or
they have taken the first hah' lead
themselves and then crumbled in
th'> lvt'i period to lose the battles
by imposing margins.
In Fiiaay night's encounter villi
El Trojan the score at half time was
18-18, the lead changed hands twice
during the final period, yet the
Cards went down to a 35-27 defeat.
Saturday nighl Stanford led at half
time bv one point, and was beaten
by thirteen points when the fine 1
gun sounded.
Consistent Losers
A San Francisco sports editor io
marked after the recent Bear-Bruin
clashes that he could not figure out
how either team ever managed to
upset the S.C. quintet, which puis
Stanford just about where they are
—in the cellar. It has been a num
ber of years since the Farm laddie,
took a stvies from their Trojan ri
vals; bin the records do reveal the
fact that the Golden Bear has eaten
Indian meat every year since ID2. r >,
wh< never a basketball series rolled
around.
If the Indians intend to upset
either of these records, and they
have already scrambled theii
chances to smash one of them, they
will have to show not only better
basketball than they have so far,
but they will have to develop the
ability to play A-l ball for the full
40 minutes.
After overcoming a six-point
margin early in the lirst half, and
finishing lhe period leading 11-10,
Stanford's basketball quintet threw
away its ehance to win a game from
the University of Southern Califor
nia Saturday night and went down
under i 32-li) drubbing.
The defeat gave the Trojans a
clean sweep of the four-game series,
shoved the Indians farther into the
conference cellar, and kept the men
of Troy on top of the heap, even
though the Battling Bears from
Berkeley took another contest from
their "little brothers," the Westwood
Bruins.
Stanford made half as many goals
as the victors and three-fourths as
many free throws. Since the Red
shirts had but one less chance at
the easy points, this may account in
part for their overwhelming defeat.
Ledger Even
"Frenchy" LaCombe suffered a
broken vertebra in Friday night s
encounter, and this may have had
something to do with the loss of the
fourth game to the Southerners, but
the Frenchman hasn't been scoring
any too well lately, and "Tiny Tom
Cordry returned to his pre-injury
form, which makes the ledger just
about balanced.
Reports from the South men
tioned nothing about the famous
S.C. "loitering tactics," but they di'l
stress die fact that Stanford scored
just one held goal in the second
half of Saturday's game, which,
edded 1o six free throws, gave them
a grant"? total ol nine points for
twenty minutes of concerted effort.
No Kcal Win
