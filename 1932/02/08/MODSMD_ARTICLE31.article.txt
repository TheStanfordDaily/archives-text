To nl 1 appearances tin's issue of the Daily does not
greatly differ from any oilier, hut there is a real differ
ence. Volume (SO is now a part of the files and this issue is
llie beginning of Volume 81.
The significance of the transition is the passing of Dick
Fricndlich, editor during the past term. Always a fighter,
Dick maintained an editorial policy that he earnestly felt
was working for a better Stanford.
Volume SI can do little better than to pursue the issues
that Dick upheld and hope that its success may be as great
as his.
He vigorously attacked the San Francisco papers for
their exaggerated and often false reports of campus af
fairs. lie battled continuously against the administration's
policy of abolishing the Lower Division. In vain he tried
to instill a little courage in the women that they might
make women's government little less of a farce.
Although firmly convinced that the present Honor Code
could only end in failure, Dick did not condemn it edi
torially but permitted the Men's Council to try it out. He
carried on a campaign for 15 cents more per student per
quarter for the Daily against the feeble objections of the
student manager.
When students sit in the Union Cellar talking over a
cup of live cent coffee, they should give thanks to him who
is responsible for their saving a nickel, Dick Fricndlich.
