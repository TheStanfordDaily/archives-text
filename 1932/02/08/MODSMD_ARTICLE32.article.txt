# ALL-PENINSULA DANCE

### 
If profits are ilie goal of two-bit depression dances on
the campus, Saturday night's affair in the Women's Gym
may have been a rousing success.
However, if the dances arc held with the purpose of
promoting just a big, happy family among Stanford "bro
kics" who an't pay the high Icirifl's of city dancing, this
latest attempt was a complete flop.
The Daily lias backed the idea of depression dances
from the start, believing that they would work toward a
more compact social unit on the Farm and forward the
old ideal of Stanford democracy.
Last week, after the lirst of these all-University depres
sion jigs, the Daily Hullsessioncr pointed out the danger
of throwing the doors of the gym open to anybody with
jazz in his blood and a quarter in his pocket. A day later
the editor reiterated Mellinkoff's plea that the dances be
limited to persons connected in some way with the Uni
versity, adding that a fine slogan would be "Campus
Dances for Campus People."
Having-men show their student body cards as qualifi
cation for laying down the small admittance fine was of
fered; yet nothing was done by either Kappa Kappa Psi,
honorary band fraternity which sponsored last Saturday
night's dance, nor by W.A.A., which leases the gym. As a
result, the affair looked even more like a San .lose ball
room fracas than the first attempt, which some conserva
tive estimates placed at only 70 per cent local.
Unless they are limited to students, dances such as the
last one will gain ever-increasing monetary success as
news of the cheap opportunity spreads over the Peninsula.
And as that happens, Stanford customers will gradually
thin out until we find ourselves running a purely commer
cial project for the entertainment of the Hay Region un
employed.
