# BULL SESSION
## NOW, THAT INDIAN 
### 
If you ever begin to walk into
that famed eating place, the Union |
dining room, you will find staring
you in the face (if you look to the
left) a small statue of a practically
naked Indian warrior. He is poised
for war and his muscles are taught
as he draws back on his bow—
which, of course, can have no string
in a statue. Although this state of !
affairs is necessary, it makes him !
look quite foolish to be sure. On :
the artistic merits of the figure, we '
do not wish to indulge, because the j
piece is merely a rough plaster- 1
papier-mache of the original.
The figure adorns the Union lobby, !
we understand, in the artist's hope
that the original will be purchased
and placed somewhere about this
campus. We trust that there is little
probability for that happening, but
even the possibility makes one un
comfortable. Why there should be a I
public statue immortalizing our
present symbol is not exactly clear.
Not so long ago, we used to be the i
"Cards" or the Cardinals; now we j
are the "Indians"; next year it is
difficult to say what we will be. i
But more important, is the fool
ishness of erecting statues to such!
•things as collegiate symbols. Espe
cially is this true when there are,
worthwhile subjects waiting to be ,
perpetuated. Of course, the first
thing that comes to mind is the ap
propriateness of erecting a fine j
statue to David Starr Jordan— I

whose spirit and personality are as
' responsible for this Stanford of ours
as the financial endowment of the j
i founder.
It may be sentimental to talk of |
such things as inspirations. Yet, one i
value of public statues is the in
spiration they may give to those
still toying with the lower rungs of
| the ladder. The statue of Jordan ,
would always be a memorial to his j
| really glorious ideals and a per
' manent remembrance that this is !
j the University where the winds of
freedom blow. But what inspiration
I can we draw from this primitive
! savage pulling on his- bow without J
! a string? Of course, "Indian" is a j
very nice sports term for a ripping, j
banging football eleven; and we are I
! not stating that the Stanford grid- j
| iron be termed the David Starr!
Jordans. That would be inappropri
ate; but no more so than the de- !
i nuded Indian placed on a conspicu- 1
ous location on the campus.
Down at U.S.C. they have a large i
; bronze statue of a Trojan warrior j
hacking away at some enemy—the !
i opponent not being visible in the i
piece, however. His presence is
| t eadily inferable, though, by the
! ferocity that fairly shines from the
! armed Trojan. There is no reason i
i for Stanford to emulate its Southern j
i rival and erect our "Indian."' We j
can well 'afford the inferiority that
may come by not having a public j
; figure to materialize our symbol. j
