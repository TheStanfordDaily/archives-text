The Editor, Sir:
If a grad may presume to submit
material for your columns on a sub
ject of general interest — even at
some length:—
When a representative Stanford
Man asks his mother "Which would
you prefer: that I go to war, or be
shot down as a traitor?" he thereby
gives damning evidence that the
psychological attitude of the Farm,
no less than the office and store, is
proving altogether too fertile soil
for the vicious propaganda which
insists that
1. No one wants war, yet
2. War is inevitable.
Because the general population,
fed on newspaper headlines alto
gether out of proportion to the im
portance of the events reported,
gains the impression that war must
follow such occurrences, do Stan
ford's "independent thinkers" fol
low suit?
Because the ideas of an outgrown
imperialism still possess the popu
lar mind, must Stanford men and
women forget their "advanced"
ideas in a time of real stress?
Because some intensely national
istic jingoists hot-headedly infringe
upon some American "rights" — or
better, "concessions—either acci
dentally or officially, does the Stan
ford intelligentsia back the "chip
on - the - shoulder" attitude of the
hot-headed adolescent who "dares"
his neighbor to invade his "cave,"
then does battle over it at X times
the cost of the cave, plus its de
struction?
Although America has outgrown
torchlight parades, and similar man
ifestations of adolescent psychology
in politics, must she maintain it with
l-egard to equally asinine war prop
aganda?
Are the thinking members of the
Stanford student body—or any sup
porters of the right of "democratic
America" to exclude foreign peo
ples or goods—so committed to the
present industrial order that they
are willing, without protest, to pro
tect the outposts of the profit-mak
ers (by no means always established
and maintained with the consent of
the peoples chiefly concerned) at the
expense of the non-profit-sharing
American tax - payers' blood and
money?
If military action is regarded as
property damage insurance, it is

J certainly the highest priced form of ,
insurance on record, and the injus- ;
tice of its cost distribution is won- '
derful to contemplate.
i Do Stanford stu — but of course
they do not think that way, and j.
THEREFORE, WAR IS NOT IN
EVITABLE!
"Therefore"?
Emphatically, '"Yes"!
If the same wires that bring
world news to the Daily flashed |
forth the news that three thousand I
i thinking students, typical of the
I world's finest, had refused to be J
: stampeded into inaccurate thinking j
by the bellowings of the profiteer |
and the "interests"—those picayune
' interests, when compared with the
i interest of the vast majority of sane
citizens in keeping the peace:
If the word were broadcast that j
the leaders, not only of tomorrow, i
but of today, refused to let the fogs I
of past practices or present poten- j
tial perils obscure for them the
j towering fact that war is HELL and
simply does not pay:
If the world heard that even a
few staunch souls, perhaps not over
a few dozen, had dared to sign a
I new Declaration of Independence,
' and refused to serve in any war,
save for the defense of the United
States (some might prefer to make 1
it unconditional;'they would not be!
the first ones):
If it were realized that those who
took such drastic action were not
cowards, but that they were afraid,
desperately afraid, that those who
do not dare to frankly face a fear,
and who are petrified by the baleful
glare of the Medusa's eyes—prece
dent and propaganda—will let the
country drift into a war, even
against its will:
If these things were in the news—
and they would make the front
pages—other seats of sanity (be
cause centers of learning—the col
leges and universities of all these
United States) would "carry on"—
this time for peace; the country
would rejoice as in a breath of fresh
air; Stanford would again have
demonstrated her genius for leader
ship; and the world would recognize
that the West, still the land of the
true Pioneer, has not been nour
ished by Stanford University and
her Pioneering First President in
vain.
