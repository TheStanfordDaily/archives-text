HIGH PRESSURE—At the Fox-
Stanford Theatre.
Bill Powell fans won't go wrong
in seeing "High Pressure." The
suave William is excellent as the
super-promoter for a phony rubber
company. Evelyn Brent, playing op
posite, supplies the "sex interest"
angle.
The show, which is nothing more
than a re-hash of all other movies
built around stock-selling fiascos, is
still sufficiently original in spots
and moves at such a fast pace that
it makes very worthwhile enter
tainment.
We hate to keep raving about
such things, but the shorts and
comedies actually set a new all-time
low for absolute worthlessness.
STEPPING SISTERS—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Apparently the only excuse for
the existence of this particular show
is the presentation of fine or two
fairly good chorus acts. One or two
fairly amusing remarks appear like
plums in an over-heavy sue! pud
ding. Ni> particular actor or actress
shows any particular ability al
though, in all fairness, neither their
lines or the plot give them a fair
chance. The story is lhat of an ex
burlesque chorine who trie: to make
good in society by putting on a

| benefit for a home for homeless cats
r.nd dogs. The professional talent
employed turns out to be a pair of
! her old teammates. The obvious de
i velopments ensue. We laughed
twice, not heartily.
The feature is accompanied by a
film of big-game hunting in darkest
i Africa. Apart from poor filming
| which tires the eyes, and silly ex
| planations, this is a good and even
exciting picture for the blood
j thirsty. | —S.C.A.
