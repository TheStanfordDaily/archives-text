BERKELEY (Special)â€” Net profits j
totaling $214,510.91 for the first '
seven months of the current fiscal
period have accrued for the A.S.U.C.,
derived chiefly from football. Fall
games lesulted in a gross profit of
$034,042, but the cost of operation
of the entire group of athletic ac
tivities reduced this figure by ap
proximately $102,000.
The balance was further reduced
by losses in other activities of the
associated students such as Dra
matics, the Store, and Stephens'
Union. Welfare and women's ath
letics took $3,212.18 from the total.
Graduate Manager W. W. Mona
han points out, however, that part
of the cash balance went toward
redeeming of $84,108.50 of California
Memorial Stadium scrip, chiefly for
tickets to the California-Stanford
'"Big Game."
The estimated expense of opera
tion on the Associated Students dur
ing th? spring season is about $115,-
000, plus interest and the guarantee
for the 1.C.4-A. track and field
championships next July. However,
Monahan declares that there is
every reason to believe that 1.C.4-A.
ticket sales will take care of ex
penses, cutting the spring estimate
by about $50,000.
