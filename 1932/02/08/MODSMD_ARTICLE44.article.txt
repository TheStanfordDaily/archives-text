now it seems that we started
this rubbish on friday with a
wail for poor old basketball that
ainl what it ought to be in the
eyes of the public and now we
wonder if maybe we were really
right in the first place there's a
warm spot in our heart for boys
whose ambition runs to throw
ing things through things he
cause we used to be pretty
handy with rocks and windows
ourselves
the fact remains that the results
of this week-ends encounters down
south are sort of dismal but nobody
laid down on the job and they
really tried hard so we neednt moan
what difference will it make five or
( en years from now whether a man
was a crack forward or center or
not he'li probably-have just as tough
a time catching tho eight fifteen tp
town as any of us lesser lights,
it also seems that there was a
hit of a smash up at the end of
the row on Saturday night a ear
turned completely over and one
of the girls climbed out of it and
started to cry because all the
gasoline was running out of the
tank and she'd just had it filled
who says there isn't a depression
of course the fragments of the
car itself didn't matter much
the leal fun of the evening though
came from the audience theres a
sorority house right up there at the
top of Issuen you know and the sis
j ters being interested in what was
1 happening outside came and gazed
' from the windows en masse and not:
j very much else
they finally turned out the
lights so that work of salvaging
tiie wreck could go on and now
we know that even if the alpha
os live behind padlocked doors
it doesn't matter at all its the
open window that tells every

Saturday night and we hope .the

I en the advance notices there were
