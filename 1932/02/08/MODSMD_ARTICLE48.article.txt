THE LAST STRAW that gave the
camel indigestion.
That's the way Farm fans are
likely to regard the injury of
"Frenchy" LaCombe, who sustained
r. cracked vertebra or two in the
first of the two week-end rough
houses at Los Angeles. While han
dicapped somewhat early in the
season by a trick knee he contracted
from football, the Frenchman had
been one of the few Indian hoop
sters to escape serious injury or
illness this year.
The forward burden for the
remaining two games with Cali
fornia will fall to the two tiny
mites of tbe squad, Cordry and
Palmer, and to Cosgrove and
Meade. What pair will start the
game at Oakland next Saturday
night is a question, as the little
fellers will be at a disadvantage
against the rangy Bears, while
Meade has been handicapped all
season by illness and may not be
able to last a full game.
Judging from the press reports
from the South, Cordry has forgot
ten all about that cracked fibula and
is playing ball as in days of yore,
which would make him a fairly
certain starter —but only a week's
practice will indicate his running
mate.
Norgard is a fixture at one guard
post, while Baker will probably be
at the ether. It was while experi
menting at Baker's position that
Lacombe was hurt Friday. As for
center, Packard is the most likely
to get the call because of his height.
RESERVE POWER is what kept
California in the race with U.S.C.
for the southern division title —re-
serve power plus Joe Kintana.
It was Joe who ran wild in
the closing minutes of Friday's
game at Oakland to win for the
Bears, and it was Joe who set
tled matters on Saturday night
AFTER three substitutes bad
been sent into the game by
Nibs Price to rescue an appar
ently lost cause.
With the score 21 to 10 in favor
of U.C.L.A. in the second half. Price
injected Eifert, bad ankle and all,
and Stone and Crowley into the
lineup. Kintana remained bottled,
as lie had been all evening, but the
newcomers tied up the score just
before the gun to send the fracas
into an extra period.
It was then that Kintana broke
loose to drop in two buckets while
the Bruins were getting one, mak
ing the final score 31 to 29.
AS A RESULT of the week-end's
play, the Bears remain a game be
hind the Trojans, but are still in
the race. For the Berkeley five to
come out on top, it will be neces
sary for them to take two victories
from Stanford while the Bruins are
stopping U.S.C. twice.
One game short of that would
leave California and the Trojans in
a tie, but it has been the rule in
Ihe past to give the title to the team
which won the series from its op
ponent, in the case of a tie. Since
Southern California won three out
of four games from the Bears, a tie
would give the Southerners the
crown.
