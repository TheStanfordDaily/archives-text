Pilot Tommy Thompson at 12:30 j
p.m., shortly after he had been sent i
out from the Salt Lake.airport in
search of the plane when it was re
ported several hours overdue. I
Thompson was unable to land at !
the scene of the crash, owing to the i
deep snow. After circling a ranch :
house nearby, Thompson landed at
Evanston, 25 miles east, and with the I
aid of the Evanston operator, who I
watched his plane as it circled the |
ranch house, telephoned the ranch- I
ers and requested them to follow |
Thompson's plane to the scene of j
the wreck. !
