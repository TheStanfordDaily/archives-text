### Albert Guerard 
Turning in their best game of the
season Friday night, the Stanford
freshmen spotted an early lead to
the powerful Santa Clara yearlings,
and then came back to battle the
Bronos on even terms for the rest
of the game. Santa Clara won 29-21,
but the determined fight of the In
dian freshmen almost toek away ihe
sting of defeat. Saturday night the
freshmen lost to Dud DeGroot's
Menlo Junior College five, 38-28,
after holding their more experienced
rivals to a 16-12 score at half time.
Santa Clara showed the good
teamwork and passing that brought
them victories over the strongest
freshman fives in the state. Ruffo,
Batini, Sebrero, Salitino, and Arne
rich started the contest, and this
band oI good Irishmen played the
whole game. The Stanford guards
bottled up the Bronco ace, Ruffo,
in the first half, but the Santa Clara
forward got loose for eleven points
in the second half, and his points
proved enough to win the game.
Half-time score favored the Broncs,
13-7. The Indians did much better
in the second period, but with Ruffo
dropping them in from all sides,
Santa Clara outscored the Indians
16-14 for the half. Gordon Mallatratt
sank two of his long shots late in
the game, but Charles Coiner's five
points earned him the Stanford
scoring honors.
Saturday night's defeat at the
hands of the Menlans was a heart
breaker after the terrific losing bat
tle waged by the Indians on Friday
night. Stanford enjoyed a 4-3 ad
vantage early in the first half, but
Menlo soon grabbed the lead. Two
minutes later a free throw by Roth
ert tied the score at seven all, but
Gardner broke through for two
set-ups in quick succession, and
Coach Vance Fawcett's charges
could nc-ver again get the lead.
The Menlans were very hot at the
beginning of the second half, and in
ten minutes ran up twenty-two
points to five for Ihe Indians. In the
last minutes of play an entire sub
stitute Stanford team netted seven
points to none for Menlo, largely
due to Joe Griswold's efforts.
Arne Anderson, former Palo Alto
High stylist, rang up fourteen points
on clean shots inside the foul-line.
Lory Rothert, the ever-improving
forward, looked good on a losing
team, scoring nine points. Charles
Coiner and Joe Griswold each ac
counted for three field goals. The
latter, though inexperienced, was
on his toes at all times, while
Coiner played his usual good game.
Jim Savage saw his fu'st real action
of the year against Santa Clara and
Menlo, living up to his fine show
ings made in last week's practice
sessions.

in the second period, but with Ruffo
dropping them in from all sides,

16-14 for the half. Gordon Mallatratt
sank two of his long shots late in
the game, but Charles Coiner's five
points earned him the Stanford
scoring honors.
Saturday night's defeat at the
hands of the Menlans was a heart
breaker after the terrific losing bat
tle waged by the Indians on Friday
night. Stanford enjoyed a 4-3 ad
vantage early in the first half, but
Menlo soon grabbed the lead. Two
minutes later a free throw by Roth
ert tied the score at seven all, but
Gardner broke through for two
set-ups in quick succession, and
Coach Vance Fawcett's charges
could nc-ver again get the lead.
The Menlans were very hot at the
beginning of the second half, and in
ten minutes ran up twenty-two
points to five for Ihe Indians. In the
last minutes of play an entire sub
stitute Stanford team netted seven
points to none for Menlo, largely
due to Joe Griswold's efforts.
Arne Anderson, former Palo Alto
High stylist, rang up fourteen points
on clean shots inside the foul-line.
Lory Rothert, the ever-improving
forward, looked good on a losing
team, scoring nine points. Charles
Coiner and Joe Griswold each ac
counted for three field goals. The
latter, though inexperienced, was
on his toes at all times, while
Coiner played his usual good game.
Jim Savage saw his fu'st real action
of the year against Santa Clara and
Menlo, living up to his fine show
ings made in last week's practice
sessions.

season Friday night, the Stanford
freshmen spotted an early lead to
the powerful Santa Clara yearlings,
and then came back to battle the
Bronos on even terms for the rest
of the game. Santa Clara won 29-21,
but the determined fight of the In
dian freshmen almost toek away ihe
sting of defeat. Saturday night the
freshmen lost to Dud DeGroot's
Menlo Junior College five, 38-28,
after holding their more experienced
rivals to a 16-12 score at half time.
Santa Clara showed the good
teamwork and passing that brought
them victories over the strongest
freshman fives in the state. Ruffo,
Batini, Sebrero, Salitino, and Arne
rich started the contest, and this
band oI good Irishmen played the
whole game. The Stanford guards
bottled up the Bronco ace, Ruffo,
in the first half, but the Santa Clara
forward got loose for eleven points
in the second half, and his points
proved enough to win the game.
