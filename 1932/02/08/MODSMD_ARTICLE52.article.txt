# RAIN FORCES TEAM TO POSTPONE FIRST TRIAL TRACK MEET
## 
### 
With the Olympic Club meet less
than a month away, Stanford var
sity trackmen still have had no
chance to display their ability, or
lack of it, this quarter.
The practice meet scheduled for
last week had to be called off due
to the impossibility of finding
enough swimming suits and water
wings with which to equip the
tracksters. The old oval resembled
a seventeenth-century country road
more than it did the track of a
civilized university, when Friday
afternoon rolled around.
The fie-shmen in particular needed
the practice, as they meet a picked
team of San Francisco All-Stars on
February 27, and as yet Coach El
lington has very little knowledge of
the real strength and weaknesses of
his yearling team. It is imperative
that the inexperienced yearling
middle-distance men get a taste of
competition before their season
opens, and an intra-team meet will
be held next Friday for that pur
pose, as well to give the varsity
runners a bit of practice.
