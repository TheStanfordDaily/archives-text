# MITTMEN TO FACE DAVIS FARMERS IN OPENER THURSDAY
## Maloney Unable To Pick Definite Squad As Season Nears 
### 
With the All-University Cham
pionships gone by the boards, Stan
ford's varsity boxing season will
get under way in the Pavilion next.
! Thursday night when "Crip"
Toomey's Davis fighters invade the
campus.
Coach Harry Maloney has not as
yet picked a definite varsity squad
to meet the Farmers. Thursday
night's bouts gave him a fairly good
line on his charges, however, and
he has expressed satisfaction with
the season outlook,
Ben Palamountain has practically
recovered from the sinus trouble
that kept him out of last week's
bouts, and Maloney plans to run off
the heavyweight championship as a
preliminary to the Davis meet. If
the plan works out, Palamountain
will meet Phil Smith and the win
ner will fight the Davis heavy at
the end of the evening.
"Slip" Gilbert, by virtue of his
I knockout win over Paul Targhetta,
i will probably represent the Indians
lin the light-heavyweight division.
!In the middleweight department
1 Fred Johnson is the logical con-
I tender. DeWitt Portal, who beat him
1 Thursday night, is ineligible for
| varsity competition.
Jim Kelley, welterweight, who
| won over Cam Jones in the tourna
ment, is the best prospect. Ed Insley
j will probably be picked to represent
j Stanford Thursday. He won an easy
i victory over John Huston and it i â– 
j doubtful if there is anyone else in
1 the weight who can approach him.
