# CHORUS MEMBERS DESCENDED FROM DARING COSSACKS
## Former Refugees Built Up Prestige Singing In Russian Church 
### 
The .'id members of the Don Cos
sack Russian Male Chorus, who
have been presenting programs to
sold-out houses from coast to coast,
and who will sing in the Pavilion
Wednesday night at 8:20 o'clock, are
direct descendants of the fearsome
bands of Cossacks who used to strike
terror in the Russia of the past
generations. The Cossacks were
known for their daring and invinci
bility. Their very name was origi
nally taken from the Turkish
"kasak," which means a pillaging
warrior.
Early in history, the Cossacks
were untamed savages. Turk and
Tartar fled before them. Later,
under Peter the Great, they were
organized into a military unit, and
in turn became the terror of Rus
sia's foes. The late Czar formed his
bodyguard from them.
Now the Cossacks have ceased to
be a military organization. The Don
Cossacks are so named because they
inhabited the territory that spreads
through the Don basin southward
toward the Sea of Azov. With its
defeat, they were taken prisoners,
and later dispersed as refugees to
various European governments.
The present members of the Don
Cossack Chorus were among those
sent to Bulgaria. Before they began
their concert touring, they worked
in factories and mines in Sofia, and
spent their evenings in choral sing
ing in the Russian Embassy Church,
where their talent drew crowds.
They are also drawing immense
crowds in the United States. Tickets
for their performance here Wednes
day night are on sale at the Concert
Series cflice in the Old Union at
$2, $1.50, and $1.00.
