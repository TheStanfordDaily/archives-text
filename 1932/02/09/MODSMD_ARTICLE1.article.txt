SHANGHAI, (Tuesday), Feb.
!(. (A')— Rain again washed the
Shanghai-Woosung battlefields
early today and with a fog ap
parently delayed a renewal of
hostilities. All fronts were quiet
as daylight came.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 8. (/P) — The
first phase of the Japanese blue
jacket and army assault along the
16-mile Shanghai-Woosung line
came to an end this morning with
the Chinese, battered by big guns
and assaulted by infantrymen, still
clinging to their positions.
Fog and rain apparently delayed
a renewal of hostilities.
Jap Drive Halted
The Japanese failed to carry out
their plan to reduce the Woosung
fortress and then sweep on toward
Shanghai.
The spirited defense of the Chi
nese demonstrated again one of the
great lessons of the World War—
that machine gunners can take
cover against heavy bombardment
and survive to stop assault lines
with their bullet streams.
Chinese headquarters in Shang
hai announced that 500 Japanese
had been mowed down by machine
guns on the Chapei front. The Japa
nese denied suffering any such
losses.
Foreign Area Shelled
The international settlement in
the vicinily of Japanese headquar
ters and the municipal police sta
tion wa.; badly damaged by Chinese
shells.
British troops barricaded Ranger
Road and thwarted a Japanese at
tempt to get to Ihe Chinese rear.
The British remained in an uncom
fortable position, with the Japanese
on one side of them and the Chinese
on the ether.
