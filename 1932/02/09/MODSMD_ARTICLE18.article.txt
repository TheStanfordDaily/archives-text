## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
"River, stay 'way from mah door!"
Statistics gathered while rain
soaked Stanforditcs scurried from
class to class indicate that a 20th
Century Noah may soon be needed.
Current rains which have con
verted the campus into a veritable
field of mud have made local his- j
tory in more ways than one. Felt
lake is filled for the first time since'
its construction in 19?9, San Fran- '
cisquito creek is breaking records
having carried 400,000 gallons of
muddy water a minute down to the
Bay on Saturday morning, Lagunita
continues to gurgle down its over
flow pipe, and Searsville daily re
ceives tons of sediment. i

That is has been more than a
little wet on the Farm is evidenced
by the tainfall gauge in the Cor
poration Yard. At noon yesterday
the marker was hovering around the
15-inch point. The city gauge in
Palo Alto yesterday afternoon regis
tered 13.83 inches for the season's
total. Higher than the readings on
' the campus gauge were ihose at
' Felt lake and Searsville. The Felt
lake gauge read 16.70 inches at 11
o'clock yesterday and the Searsville
j gauge showed a precipitation of
23.02 inches for the season.
According to James W. McDon
nell, assistant superintendent of
, buildings and grounds, Stanford's

water supply for Ibe coming yea
is more than adequate for all pur
poses. Approximately (520.000,00(
gallons of water is now in storage
at Searsville and Felt lake, Stan
' ford's Iwo reservoirs.
Overflow from Searsville whicl
I last week was being diverted int<
the arboretum has been turnedbacl
in 1 o the creek.
I And so Stanford enjoys a we
year—with creeks full and reser
voirs brimming, with cars beinj
stuck in the mud and prosperity
I blessing the tow-car business, li
makes the farmers happy and it
postpones the hnnual epidemic oi
j spring fever.

its construction in 19?9, San Fran- '
cisquito creek is breaking records
having carried 400,000 gallons of
muddy water a minute down to the
Bay on Saturday morning, Lagunita
continues to gurgle down its over
flow pipe, and Searsville daily re
ceives tons of sediment. i

That is has been more than a
little wet on the Farm is evidenced
by the tainfall gauge in the Cor
poration Yard. At noon yesterday
the marker was hovering around the
15-inch point. The city gauge in
Palo Alto yesterday afternoon regis
tered 13.83 inches for the season's
total. Higher than the readings on
' the campus gauge were ihose at
' Felt lake and Searsville. The Felt
lake gauge read 16.70 inches at 11
o'clock yesterday and the Searsville
j gauge showed a precipitation of
23.02 inches for the season.
According to James W. McDon
nell, assistant superintendent of
, buildings and grounds, Stanford's

water supply for Ibe coming yea
is more than adequate for all pur
poses. Approximately (520.000,00(
gallons of water is now in storage
at Searsville and Felt lake, Stan
' ford's Iwo reservoirs.
Overflow from Searsville whicl
I last week was being diverted int<
the arboretum has been turnedbacl
in 1 o the creek.
I And so Stanford enjoys a we
year—with creeks full and reser
voirs brimming, with cars beinj
stuck in the mud and prosperity
I blessing the tow-car business, li
makes the farmers happy and it
postpones the hnnual epidemic oi
j spring fever.
