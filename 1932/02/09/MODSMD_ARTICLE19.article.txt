# A
						COMMUNITY PROBLEM

### 
Stanford I'niversity, like every oilier community in lliel
country, is laced with a detinite problem growing out of the i
present economic crisis. This year many students returned
to school with the former financial hacking from their
homes curtailed or cut oil entirely.
Profitable part-time jobs in Palo Alto have been greatly;
decreased. The cash funds in the deans' olliccs from which
loans are made to students have been greatly depleted by
the unusual drain upon them. Consequently there arc
many students on the campus who are in actual need of
funds. In many cases a very small amount of money would
enable a student to remain in school.
Acting-President Robert K. Swain has appointed a com
mittee lo take care of this emergency situation. It remains
for the students and other residents of the campus to solve j
this problem.
There will be no drive for individual contributions. It
is up to campus organizations voluntarily to donate money i
raised bv social functions or other methods.
This is not a time for sentiment or hysteria. An emer
gency situation confronts Stanford, as it faces every other
community, and Stanford, as a community, must respond.
