# CAMERA ARTIST IN MEXICO TALK
## 
### 
Colored slides will accompany the
' lecture on Mexico which Fred P.
; Clatworthy, landscape photogra
pher, will give in the Assembly
Hall at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
Illustrations in natural color have
been Clatworthy's specialty since
1000 and he has supplied pictures
j to World's Work, Outlook, and Na
| tional Geographic magazines for the
, past few years. The slides which he
â–  will exhibit with his talk tonight
j are the first natural-tinted ones
ever to be shown in America.
Fifteen years of research and ex
perimentation and a half million
miles of travel are two of the rea
sons loi Clatworthy's prominence as
v photographer. Colorado and tin'
; Southwest are mainly the locations
for his American-made pictures;
perhaps because, although Chie: go
was the site of his studying, CI it-
birthplace was Estes, Cclo
rado.
Audiences all over the United
States have seen Clatworthy's slider,
projected. As a member of the
; Denver Art Association and the
, Pictorial Photographers of America,
! he has had the opportunity of rep
i resenting those soeietii s on numer
ous occasions.
