# AND DURING DEPRESSION, TOO

A new Jinaiu'ial bunion to ho carriod on student should
ers already stooped under the weight of high-priced eduea
lion loomed near yesterday afternoon in a proposed Palo
Alto ordinanee whieh would eliminate all-night auto park
ing on the streets.
The measure was reeonmiended by the Hoard of Public
Safety, which is the power behind tlie police organization
of the city. It was to be acted upon last niglit by the City
Council, but numerous squawks by off-campus students
and other citizens of Palo Alto who can't afford storage
caused the council to return the proposal to the board for
modification.
The Daily is not particularly versed in the specific
"danger to tra 11 ic of all-night parking" problem, but it
cannot understand how an automobile along the curb is
necessarily more of a menace than the several trees which
have stood in the streets of Palo Alto night and day for
years, some of them projecting a very considerable distance
from the curbing.
It is undoubtedly true that the work of policemen who
( heck all-night parked cars in search of stolen one would
be greatly simplified. That would be lino. Hut the question
is. should that saving of work be purchased at the price of
a $10 per month garage bill plus inconvenience for every
car-owning student in Palo Alto. Many of them already
gel along on two meals a day to buy gas for their ears, and
transportation is almost a necessity of life for an off
< ampus Stanfordito. ,
A flood of objections postponed the proposal yesterday.
Perhaps by increasing that llood to a deluge, those students
concerned could kill it outright.
