# MALIGNED JAPAN
## 
### 
II is really too bad that the other powers should keep
sending harsh notes to Japan about this Shanghai affair.
'I hey don't seem to comprehend the cruel situation, created :
through no action of her own, which forces Nippon to
throw her troops against the Chinese. One of the latest
statements reported from Tokyo concerning reinforce
ments for the International Settlement ought to make this
clear to the most prejudiced observer.
"The object motivating Japan," says the report, "is the
same which has prompted other powers to increase their
iorces at Shanghai.
"Activities of additional Japanese troops being sent to
Shanghai will be conlined to protecting the interests and
safety of 30,000 Japanese residents, and to carry out Jap
an's part in the defense of the international settlement.
"The new Japanese troops will not attack the Chinese
unless the Chinese interfere with the performance of those j
specific duties."
Now that makes everything plain. The militaristic west
ern nations so stirred up China by their aggressive policy
in Shanghai that she rushed her bandit hordes upon the
defenseless city. Whereupon Japan, rudely awakened from
a too-conciliatory attitude, lias been forced to rush marines
across the sea to help in the desperate defense of be-,
leaguered Shanghai.
And furthermore, she has generously taken it upon her
self to make up for her tardy arrival on the scene by as
suming the entire burden of protecting the city. Freely
expending men and money, Japan has hurled her fighting
men against the Chapei district with the sole object of pro
tecting her .'SO,OOO nationals.
Of course, it was merely Chinese subtlety which pro
duced the impression that the lirst attack came from the
Japanese side.
If the invading Chinese will withdraw from Chinese
territory and cease their practice of stopping Japanese bul
lets. the 10,000 soldiers now en route to Shanghai will cer
tainly not molest the citizens of the Middle Kingdom.
What could be fairer? These propagandists who insist
that Japan entered Shanghai because of the Chinese boy
colt and that Tokyo contemplates aggressive action to have
trade restored are enough to make a self-respecting man
dispair of the human race.
All the members of the Stanford Daii.y editorial stall'
will gather for an informal meeting in the Daily olTice at
I o'clock today. If behooves all to attend.
Tonight at 7 :.'>() o'clock the freshman and sophomore
men o! I Business Stall will gather together to discuss
future policy. Since it is a meeting for men only it is ex
pecled that none will be absent.

sending harsh notes to Japan about this Shanghai affair.
'I hey don't seem to comprehend the cruel situation, created :
through no action of her own, which forces Nippon to
throw her troops against the Chinese. One of the latest
statements reported from Tokyo concerning reinforce
ments for the International Settlement ought to make this
clear to the most prejudiced observer.
"The object motivating Japan," says the report, "is the
same which has prompted other powers to increase their
iorces at Shanghai.
"Activities of additional Japanese troops being sent to
Shanghai will be conlined to protecting the interests and
safety of 30,000 Japanese residents, and to carry out Jap
an's part in the defense of the international settlement.
"The new Japanese troops will not attack the Chinese
unless the Chinese interfere with the performance of those j
specific duties."
Now that makes everything plain. The militaristic west
ern nations so stirred up China by their aggressive policy
in Shanghai that she rushed her bandit hordes upon the
defenseless city. Whereupon Japan, rudely awakened from
a too-conciliatory attitude, lias been forced to rush marines
across the sea to help in the desperate defense of be-,
leaguered Shanghai.
And furthermore, she has generously taken it upon her
self to make up for her tardy arrival on the scene by as
suming the entire burden of protecting the city. Freely
expending men and money, Japan has hurled her fighting
men against the Chapei district with the sole object of pro
tecting her .'SO,OOO nationals.
Of course, it was merely Chinese subtlety which pro
duced the impression that the lirst attack came from the
Japanese side.
If the invading Chinese will withdraw from Chinese
territory and cease their practice of stopping Japanese bul
lets. the 10,000 soldiers now en route to Shanghai will cer
tainly not molest the citizens of the Middle Kingdom.
What could be fairer? These propagandists who insist
that Japan entered Shanghai because of the Chinese boy
colt and that Tokyo contemplates aggressive action to have
trade restored are enough to make a self-respecting man
dispair of the human race.
All the members of the Stanford Daii.y editorial stall'
will gather for an informal meeting in the Daily olTice at
I o'clock today. If behooves all to attend.
Tonight at 7 :.'>() o'clock the freshman and sophomore
men o! I Business Stall will gather together to discuss
future policy. Since it is a meeting for men only it is ex
pecled that none will be absent.
II is really too bad that the other powers should keep
sending harsh notes to Japan about this Shanghai affair.
