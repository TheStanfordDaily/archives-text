# BULL SESSION
## THE
						MID-YEARLY FARCE 
### 
One of the saddest spectacles that
1 can be witnessed is the electing of
student officers here at Stanford.
So sad, it becomes pitiful; and so
| pitiful, il becomes a hilarious farce.
1 In "Cit" and in other courses we
I £re supposed to learn how intelli
gent voters should act. Get the facts
—the candidate's record and pJat
i form—and then vote for the best
man.
I The theory is glorious and inspir
ing. Yet here on the campus—where
most students should get their first
real taste of voting—the classroom
; theory is a meaningless nothing.
The final blue-books will be able to
describe in great detail the processes
of political action; but the knowl
edge therein never leaves the musty
1 confines of the lecture hall.
But how can the students vote
J intelligently? There are no clearly
j defined issues at stake; the candi
[ date's views on anything are en
tirely unknown. Perhaps, he doesn't
| even have views. But if he were
: forced to conduct a real campaign,
he would soon acquire some opin
ions; and a small unit like the cam
pus could compel him to stick to
those ideas. Now, we usually elect
athletes to office. That is only na
tural and proper under our present i
system. That is the only way a stu
dent can become well known. And
• only by being well known can be j
I elected for the poor student cannot
vote on anything else but popularity !
because that's all there is to vote on. j
And why aren't there issues dis
-1 cussed? Not because there are no
| issues—no, there are plenty of is- 1
sues. The Daily columns are filled j

'with them every day. The reason
why issues aren't discussed is be- :
cause some people think that dis- ■
|cussion of issues is cheap politics j
I and unfit for a college campus. But ;
actually, which is more decent—a
| little or even a great deal of loud
discussion, and even political ~f>ally- :
j hoo at times, or the secret type of \
i political stuff that goes on now? i
; And plenty of it does go on to be !
j sure.
Now, we have most of the evils
lof politics without any of the at
i tendant benefits—that is the pub
-1 licity given to issues; and clear cut j
j stands on things dear to the hearts j
i of everybody on campus. Too many ,
! students acquire the notion that all I
| politics are dirty and crooked and !
1 therefore should be avoided. As a
j result, when they get out into Life
] —with a capital "L"—they leave the j
I realm of government to be con- !
j trolled by a group of penny politi- i
cians who are in the "Racket" for j
j what it will bring. But, on the other ,
h;ind, if all the knowledge that is J
acquired in class could be actually j
put into operation on the campus in j
an honest-to-goodness, life fashion ;
—then not only would campus stu
dent elections mean something; but
graduates might take a greater in
terest in political things out of col
j lege.
As it is, to use a Stanford pro- j
' lessor's expression, when the thou- ;
: sand or so students saunter to che i
i polls tomorrow, they will no more j
i be able to find real issues than a i
"blind man looking in a dark room
1 for a black cat that is not there."
