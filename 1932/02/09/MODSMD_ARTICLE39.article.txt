THE STORY OF JULIAN — By
Susan Ertz. Applcton, 1932.

This latest work by the author of
' "Galaxy" should not only uphold
but increase her previous popular
ity. It is the story of a young Eng
! lish boy whose sensitive disposition
! is being slowly warped by the con
stant demands of a neurotic and
too-religious mother and the strain
of a household in which his mother
and father are not on speaking
terms. The characters are all figures
in the literary world and all in
teresting and varied. The author
| has drawn them with finesse and
subtlety.
I Perhaps the best parts of the book
' are those which are quite incidental
to the iilot, the introduction of what
j are presumably the author's opin
ions on life, love, and religion. Her
ideas are modern in conception and
age-old in truth. One gets the im
i pression that Susan Ertz has re
i tained the ideals and the freshness
of thinking of youth and fortified
them with the experience of age
and has found that youth is right
: after all. She shows the same impa
tience with narrow-mindedness and
short-sightedness that characterizes
the enthusiasms usually attributed
! to youth with a clarity of expres
sion an dargument which unfor
tunately rarely accompany them. If
you feel revolutionary and rebel
lious against the old-fashioned ideas
of your elders and betters "The
Story of Julian" should soothe you.
Even if you do feel content it is
interesting both as a story and an
excellent piece of writing.

FORBIDDEN—At the New Menlo

Theatre, Menlo Park.
) Both Barbara Stanwyck and
! Adolpho Menjou make the most of
! their opportunities for strong emo
; tional acting. Miss Stanwyck gives
a fine portrayal in her stereotyped
j role of the country-girl-in-search
of-love. Aclolphe Menjou rises to
' fiery dramatic heights of which j
| hitherto we had not thought him j
j capable.
The show itself is a little too de- i
pressing. Hollywood should realize |
! that a good tragedy depends on j
| something' more than one of the j
principals dying at the end. As was ;
the case in "The Champ," a tragic !
iinis is evidently supposed to cause ;
I one to overlook slight defects in I
! acting and directing. Morbidity, of !
! all things, should be handled deli- j
I eately, and should not be overdone. \
On the same bill, there is a bur- !
i lesque on the Wild, Wild West, j
] which is really funny; and that is'
i more than we've said of comedies [
in a good many moons.

TIIE MONSTER—At the Alcazar
| Theatre, San Francisco.

For a first night, and discounting !
i all of the usual mechanical errors, i
■ ''The Mi nster" started off on what :
should turn into a good run. A j
. Henry Duffy production, staged by j
Russell Fillmore—a horror-affair j
with a demented principle character.
To Earl Lee, as "Red" MacKenzie, j
' go the acting honors. He makes a !
' splendid detective-tramp, and keeps j
j the action going. Clarence Geldert, |
as Dr. Gustave Ziska, is exception- |
j ally well cast. The scenery is ex- !
I cellent, and ghosts and spirits run |
] rampant—the usual mystery play, I
! lather better than usually handled. I
