The Editor, Sir:
A number of students have mis
interpreted the intended meaning of
the article in last Tuesday's Daily.
Even Bull Sessioner Mr. Mellinkoff
was misled by the sensation-seeking
heading of the column.
It is absurd to believe that the
faculty is responsible for the pres
ent situation in regard to the Honor
Code. If the professors could be
rightly blamed for any failure of
the Code it is logical that some sort
of attempt should be made to re
form the faculty. But the Men's
Council has sponsored the discus
sion meetings with the freshmen
under the assumption that reform
must be begun by the lower-class
men.
The views expressed in the article
were not those of any one indi
vidual, but reflected opinions and
remarks of new students, which
were based upon their experiences
in certain classes. We agree with
Mr. Mellinkoff in that professorial
attitudes cannot alter the present
situation in respect to the Code.
Upperclassmen are not interested
in, and are not influenced by the
prof't opinion or remarks on the
matter. Many faculty members have
shown, by their co-operation, an
interest in the Code's success. But
the attitude of certain other mem
bers of the faculty has been such
as to endanger the enthusiasm of
the freshmen in their earnest en
deavor to build the foundation from
which the ideal—a traditional and
automatic code of honor among
Stanford students—can be achieved.
