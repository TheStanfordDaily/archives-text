# SMITH'S SPEECH STIRS BOURBONS
## Expect Decision To Halt Roosevelt Boom 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. (/P) â€”
Stirred as by no other development
since the momentous days of 28,
the Democrats of the nation read
and reread the pronouncement of
Alfred E. Smith, and began once
more taking for and against
him.
In spite of his reiteration that
he would not seek renomination, it
remained the almost unanimous
opinion of political leaders that his
willingness to accept support had
put him squarely into the contest.
Say Roosevelt Ilit
In the main, those who want to
puncture the high-riding boom for
Franklin D. Roosevelt predicted
that Smith's attitude quickly would
do the trick. The Roosevelt men
themselves replied that the effect
would be instead to redouble their
efforts and strengthen their candi
date.
A charge that the power interests
were seeking to defeat Roosevelt
was made in the Senate by Senator
Wheeler of Montana, a Roosevelt
partisan. The House cheered a pro
posal by Representative Blanton
(D., Tex.), that Speaker John N.
Gamer be made the nominee if
Smith and Roosevelt stop each
other.
Norris Hits Move
From Senator Norris of Nebraska,
a Republican insurgent who bolted
four ye:;rs ago to Smith, came the
prediction that the Democratic
Party was preparing to "make a
damn fool of itself." Passing through
Memphis, Tenn., Senator Norris
said:
"This is truly a Demoratic year,
and the election would be a cinch
for the Democrats if they could be
harmonious."
