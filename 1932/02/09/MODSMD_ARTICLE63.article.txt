# Cardinal Hoopsters Face Final Games
## INDIANS TO MEET U.C. IN LAST TWO GAMES OF SEASON LaCombe, Palmer, Norgard Likely To Be Out With Injuries 
### 
With nine games of the season
just a memory, and the two remain
ing ones against the championship
minded Bears, Coach John Bunn
last night set to work to whip into
shape what is left of Stanford's var
sity basketball squad.
If Old Man Hard Luck could have
hit the Redshirts any harder than
he has this year, Farm fans are un
able to figure out just how he would
have accomplished this. First Moffat*
decided to graduate, and then Top
ping failed to return to school. Af
ter that the playful old gent turned
the march of events over to the
well-known Injury Jinx, and the
Indians hit the skids for fair.
LaCombe Out
Doub, Cordry, Schneika, Edelen,
and now LaCombe, Palmer, and
Norgard have been laid up at one
time or another, to run up what is
probably the most amazing hospital
list in the history of Stanford var
sity basketball.
"Frenchy" LaCombe snapped a
vertebra in Friday night's game
with the Trojans. The same night
Palmer turned his ankle, played on
it again the next night, and now is
out for at least two days. Norgard
wrecked his ankle when, with
Nemer temporarily resting on his
foot, he tried to pivot. The injury
will probably keep him out of the
first California battle.
Two Forwards Left
Of the forwards who have played
even a fair amount of the games to
date, Bunn had just two left, Cordry
and Meade. Cosgrove has been
shifted tc guard to team with Ede
len. This leaves Baker and Tod in
reserve for the all-important second
clash with the Berkeley team.
The Bears are snapping at the
heels of the Trojan Horse, just one
game behind the conference leaders.
If the Bruins should upset S.C., and
the Bears should tear the Indians
apart in their last two games, Ber
keley would trek north to play the
Northern Conference champions.
And perhaps if the Redshirts could
assemble a full team or two, all at
once, ihe Bears' rosy dreams would
do just that!
