# BABE HOOPMEN TO FACE BEAR CUBS SATURDAY:
## Frosh Face Home Stretch, Three Games Won, Three Lost 
### Albert Guerard 
The home stretch!
Three games won, eight lost, and
with four contests left to play, (
Coach Vance Fawcett's Stanford
Freshmen are entering the home
stretch,* overwhelming short-enders
their final contests of the year, but
still lighting to break into the win- j
ning sprint that would carry them
past the wire ahead of the opposi- ,
tion, and with a Little Big Series
victory in their grasp.
Saturday night brings the crucial |
game of the season, and it'll be the j
old story of good little man and ;
good big man when the Indian
yearlings take the floor against the
Bear Cubs in the second, and per- '
haps deciding, game of the annual j
freshman series, with the Califor
nians possessing every pre-game ,
advantage of size, records, and ex- j '
pericnce. The two teams will play j (
at G:3O o'clock, as a preliminary to
the Big Game struggle between
varsity teams of the two schools.
Defense Big Chance
Stanford's biggest chance of top- j ,
pling the Golden Bear with a well
aimed Indian arrow is in concen- j ,
trating the defensive unit of the j
team for the purpose of checking ,
California's big-gun set-up artists, j
Dave Meeks and Harold Bauer. |
"Rim-eyes" affected most of the j
Stanford shooters in their games
with Santa Clara and Menlo last
week-end. Countless well-aimed 1
shots from the hands of the Indian
forward wall would hit the rim and i
bounce off. Lory Rot her t was a j
notable exception, sinking four nice |
shots on Saturday night, while j
Charles Coiner was at least up to 1
par.
Sales May Start
Tom Sales, the tall center-guard, 1
returns to practice this week after :
a short layoff, and he may yet break |
into the starting lineup on Saturday j
night. Sales has shown more im- 1
provement from the first games of j
the season than any other man on I
the squad, with the possible excep- j
tion of Jim Savage. But improve- ,
ment has been the rule rather than i
the exception among the freshman
cagers, and many men, including j
Lory Rothert, Tom Kelly, the Coiner
twins, Jim Trompas, Winstead j
Weaver, Johnny Mack, and Jakej
Butts, have developed from rather j
sorry prospects into real basketball j
players. j ]
Galileo Game Friday
In fact, Wally Crowe, center, and <
Fawceit's two crack guards, Gordon (
Mallatratt and Joe Butte, were the i r
only men who appeared to have en- i (
joyed real experience before en- i j

listing for the freshman team.
Friday night brings another
strong San Francisco prep team,
Galileo, to face the yearling five.

Friday night brings another
strong San Francisco prep team,
Galileo, to face the yearling five.
The Galileans are now tied wilh

their final contests of the year, but

game of the season, and it'll be the j
old story of good little man and ;
good big man when the Indian
yearlings take the floor against the
Bear Cubs in the second, and per- '

freshman series, with the Califor
nians possessing every pre-game ,
advantage of size, records, and ex- j '

at G:3O o'clock, as a preliminary to
the Big Game struggle between
varsity teams of the two schools.
Defense Big Chance
Stanford's biggest chance of top- j ,
pling the Golden Bear with a well
aimed Indian arrow is in concen- j ,

team for the purpose of checking ,

notable exception, sinking four nice |
shots on Saturday night, while j
