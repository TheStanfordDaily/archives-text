# HOSPITAL LIST AGAIN HINDERS CARD QUINTET
## LaCornbe, Norgard, Palmer Lost To Squad As U.C. Game Approaches TILT SET FOR OAKLAND U.C.L.A Win Over Trojans May Yet Mean Tie 
### Dick Rodda 
Gathering together what is left of
the Stanford basketball team, John
Dunn last night found that he had
just eleven regulars left with which
to build an attack for the second
game with the California Bears at
the Oakland auditorium next Sat
urday night.
The Cardinal squad, handicapped
by injuries all season, was nearly
wrecked last week-end when La-
Combe and Norgard were lost to the
team, which gives the Indians only a
very remote chance of downing the
Bears in either of the two remain
ing games on the schedule.
Playoff Possible
California's only hope of taking
the title is to defeat Stanford twice
while U.C.L.A. whips the Trojans in
one of the remaining two contests
in the South. This would result in
a tic for first between the Bears and
Trojans and would necessitate a
playoff series. It is entirely possible
that the Bruins may upset Sam
Barry's quintet as they already hold
a victory over the Trojans in the
first game of the series. The Bruins
seem to be the only conference team
yet that has successfully overcome
Barry's delayed tactics by letting
the Trojans stall as long as they
like.
Has Fighting Chance
Meanwhile, Stanford's remote
chances of stopping the Bears de
pend upon "fight." The squad has
had plenty of it all season but
doesn't seem to be able to keep it
up for the full forty minutes of
play. With more than half the team
on the sick list the squad will have
to fight harder than ever to come
anywhere near finishing the game
with more points than those ob
tained by Kintana, Eiffert, Fiead,
and a few others.
There is only one thing favorable
to the situation here and that is
that "Tiny Tom" Cordry will be in
the Card lineup. Cordry had to
watch the last Bear-Indian argu
ment from the bench while his
teammate, LaCombe, was bottled up
by the California guards. Cordry
may break loose as he did a year
ago in the only basketball game
Stanford has won from California
in five years.
