# STUDENT AID APPEAL
## 
### 
Lditor's .Xolc The following letter U'as sent In non-student residents <>) the
campus:
Following on I (Ik* plan recommended by Hi <* National
Committee on Unemployment, every city and town was
asked last November to appoint a "Mayor's Committee" to
provide extra work and to raise funds to meet extreme
emergencies due to local unemployment conditions.
Our own town of Palo Alto has already met this chal
lenge in a manner which has been an inspiration to other
communities. Those of our facility and employees living in
Palo Alto have already responded to the appeal there.
And now Acting President Swain has appointed to deal
with the unemployment problems of the campus.
What are these emergency problems in our own com
munity? Here are the conditions as indicated by a recent
hasty survey:
Students returned to Stanford this year with the former
financial backing from their families seriously curtailed
or cut oil' entirely. They found here that paying part-time
jobs were few and far between. The result has been a stu
dent unemployment problem or "squeeze" comparable to
that existing outside the campus.
Many students are living from hand to mouth, some are
getting along on insufficient food and others (with the ut
most willingness to work), are unable to earn money
enough to meet other urgent needs.
At the present time, these cases range all the way from
need of food to Jack of money to pay syllabus fees or eye
glasses necessary to continue classwork.
These emergency cases will be cumulative unless
prompt action is taken. The offices of Dean Culver and
Dean Yost have met all cases to the limit of funds available
for such purposes. Practical help has come through the
Stanford Mothers' Club and more than will ever be known
has quietly been done by individuals both on and off the
campus.
. Hut funds are running low and we have long months
before us until the end of the academic year. Students
forced to leave Stanford for lack of employment or other
help here will only increase the unemployment outside.
Many of those forced out could be retained here by slight,
temporary, emergency help.
Dr. Swain's committee, signing this letter, asks all mem
bers of the campus community for help along these definite
lines:
1. Let us know of any work which you can offer and
pay for. This is the most self-respecting answer to the
problem.
2. Send us your contribution in money to lake care of
those needs that must be met with emergency cash. We will
try to have loans "worked out" later.
I}, (live us the facts of any cases of need which come to
your notice.
This is not an otticial University appeal. It is a campus
community movement to meet our own local emergencies.
It concerns only our neighbors, our employees and the stu
dents now within our gates.
