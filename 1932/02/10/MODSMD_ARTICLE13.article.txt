iSteppes" gave their 2000 th concert :
1 last month in Carnegie Hall, New ;
! York, with all standing room sold, j
; Deems Taylor, considered Ameri- I
i ca's authority on music, wrote at j
j this time: "It is the best chorus I j
J ever haard or hope ever to hear. In
! tonal beauty, in artistry, in techni
cal command, and in repertoire, it ,
i is well-night flawless." 1
The compass of their voices,
I ranges from A below the bass to
! D of the fourth line in the treble
clef. They are capable of producing
| extraordinary falsetto and bass ef- j
fects. The program of reverent
j church music, beautiful, haunting
j folk-songs, and rousing soldier l
j songs, as well as the famous Volga j

Boat song gives opportunity for
great variety.
Serge JarofT, the diminutive lead
er, an officer in the Imperial army
during the World War, decided to
gather ihe chorus when he heard
the soldiers, descendants of the
fearsome Cossacks of the Don val
ley, singing around the campfires.
When the army was defeated and
sent to a prison camp near Con
stantinople, he continued training
the 36 men he had chosen. Exiled
to Bulgaria, the chorus sang in the
Russian Embassy Church in Sofia
until it went on concert tour.
