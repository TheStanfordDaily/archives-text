# STANFORD POLOISTS TO PLAY ARIZONA TWO-GAME SERIES
## 
### 
Stanford's two-game series with
Ihe Arizona polo team has been
postponed until February 25-27,
Captain Richard A. Gordan an
nounces. It was necessary to move
ahead the original dates of Feb
ruary 19-20 because of a conflict
with a rodeo then.
With a week's more practice now
made possible, chances for the Card
riders look somewhat brighter than
they did heretofore. Recent rains
have soaked up the field to such an
extent that it will be at least an
other week before any scrimmaging
can be done. Had the team been
forced to keep the earlier â€¢ dates,
practically no intensive workouts
would have been possible before
the matches.
