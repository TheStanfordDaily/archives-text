Rallying in the last few minutes of
I play, a scrappy Alpha Delta Phi
quintet came back to defeat the
' Alpha Sigs 18-12 at the pavilion
last night. After trailing 12-6, the
j Alpha Delts started a sudden spurt
in the middle of the last half, and
with Dick Miles sinking two bas
| kets and Ed Savage making a lone
I ringer, they soon tied the score.
1 Miles, Howell, and Van Dellen put
the game on ice with three more
J nicely placed shots.
Dick Miles took high point honors
! with four baskets and a foul to his
: credit, while Ernie Stump made six
points for the losers.
" Phi Sigs Show
The Phi Sigs won over the A.T.O.
' five in another 18-12 game, but in
; spite of the fact that the A.T.O.'s
| were only trailing by two points at
| half time, the result of this en
i counter was never in doubt. Cary
j Odell, George Worley, and Bob
; Wardwell each scored six points for
! the Phi Sigs. Ernie Arbuckle and
: A1 Cook led the A.T.O.'s with five
â–  digits apiece.
Score Close
Rough play was predominant in
the Zeta Psi-Phi Gamma Delta
fracas which the Zetes won 9-6.
i The two squads had no team-work,
|;and most of the points came via the
('foul x - oute. Chuck White led the
scoring with six points for the win
ners, while Bill Jaekle made the
Fiji's only field goal and also sank
a foul.
Los Arcos easily routed Theta Xi
.24-10 in the fourth game last night,
| with Madden and Valentine making
i twenty of the team's 24 points.
