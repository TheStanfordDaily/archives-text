The business of an eleelion is to elect, and that as
speedily and with as lillle uncertainty as possible. When,
as was Hie ease willi yesterday's voting, a majority of the
(■llices contested remain undecided and have to he settled
by a second balloting it would seem that there is something
wrong with the system under which the election was con
ducted.
Out of the 1 long list of candidates for the IK offices on
the ballot yesterday, only 8 received a ma jority of the votes
( asl for their respective positions, leaving 2(1 to run again
in the next of Stanford's eternal revotes.
This sort of thing is one of the prime reasons for the
general lack of interest in student body elections. Knowing
that most of the posts will not be decided by the first vote,
many do not feel any obligation to participate in the pre
liminary. \nd by the time the rcvote rolls around, the
campus is pretty well bored with the subject f»f elections in
general, with the result that the voting is even lighter than
in the first election.
Despite the fact that they are honored by custom, re
votes are by no means a necessary part of any election.
