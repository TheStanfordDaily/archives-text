## EXAMINATIONS ON PARADE 
### 
One of the more permanent and the students part of the time; but
persistent traditions around the you can't frustrate all of the stu-
Quad —quite active at all limes- is dents any of the time. The thing to
the habit of the faculty to offer to do L to vary the questions,
the students the pleasure of takinu

examinations. Of the value of this
practice, it is not our purpose to
discuss. What we are interested in,
however, is the fact that old exam
inations are not placed where they
are available for all. No one can
1 seriously deny that many students
find ways and means to peruse old
i quiz sheets despite the efforts of
some professors to keep possible
questions one of the mysteries of
life.
Assuming that the purpose of ex
aminations is to find out what "stu
dents know" — (how often that
i phrase has rung through some bat
tered classroom) —and not to find
an excuse for exercising the lower
part of the "curve" to beat students
; into an academic fervor, then there
is no reason why old examinations
should not be placed in some pub
lic place. They do help the studenl
i m studying; some find it quite hard
to read and study generalities; past,
questions are sighting points upon
which study may be directed.
Of course if a professor is the
kind who asks the same questions
over and over again, then former
examinations cause only a partial
study of the material. That is indeed
bad—poor studying on the student's
part and poorer examinationing on
the professor's part. The real cure
is not tc attempt to keep former
questions from students—because
I that is impossible. You can keep
part of the questions from part of

The criticism is also raised that
after many years, all possible ques
tion;; will have been asked, and then
what can the poor professor do when
finals roll around. Assume the im
possible and assume the above to
be correct, then what? If all pos
sible questions have been asked—
1 and if all possible questions are ex
posed to the students -and all pos
sible questions are mastered by the
student,i, then the entire course has
been learned! Is not that the very
ideal that the professor claims he is
attempting in every fight talk he
gives before midterms and before
finals?
Of course, the ideal way to study
is to master the field and then let
any question come that may. But
students are not idealists; they are
realists. They take the shortest dis
tance between two points despite
any keep-oft-the-grass signs that
may try to bar the way. They pass
a course in the easiest way—study
questions the professor thinks are
important.
Why not be democratic with ex
aminations and file them at the de
partment's office by courses; or
even at the library in permanent
loose-leaf binders? As it is, most
living groups keep huge files with
precious past questions since way
back when Zilch was a pup. Other
students apple-polish readers, and
get their old exams that way. Why
not give them to everybody?

questions one of the mysteries of
life.
Assuming that the purpose of ex
aminations is to find out what "stu
dents know" — (how often that
i phrase has rung through some bat
tered classroom) —and not to find
an excuse for exercising the lower
part of the "curve" to beat students
; into an academic fervor, then there
is no reason why old examinations
should not be placed in some pub
lic place. They do help the studenl
i m studying; some find it quite hard
to read and study generalities; past,
questions are sighting points upon
which study may be directed.
Of course if a professor is the
kind who asks the same questions
over and over again, then former
examinations cause only a partial
study of the material. That is indeed
bad—poor studying on the student's
part and poorer examinationing on
the professor's part. The real cure
is not tc attempt to keep former
questions from students—because
I that is impossible. You can keep
part of the questions from part of

The criticism is also raised that
after many years, all possible ques
tion;; will have been asked, and then
what can the poor professor do when
finals roll around. Assume the im
possible and assume the above to
be correct, then what? If all pos
sible questions have been asked—
1 and if all possible questions are ex
posed to the students -and all pos
sible questions are mastered by the
student,i, then the entire course has
been learned! Is not that the very
ideal that the professor claims he is
attempting in every fight talk he
gives before midterms and before
finals?
Of course, the ideal way to study
is to master the field and then let
any question come that may. But
students are not idealists; they are
realists. They take the shortest dis
tance between two points despite
any keep-oft-the-grass signs that
may try to bar the way. They pass
a course in the easiest way—study
questions the professor thinks are
important.
Why not be democratic with ex
aminations and file them at the de
partment's office by courses; or
even at the library in permanent
loose-leaf binders? As it is, most
living groups keep huge files with
precious past questions since way
back when Zilch was a pup. Other
students apple-polish readers, and
get their old exams that way. Why
not give them to everybody?
