A BILL OF ONE-ACT PLAYS—At
the Palo Alto Community Theatre
This program of one-act plays by
tnembers of the Theatre Group was,
il unpretentious, infinitely better
than the program of a week ago.
Guy Barker's "A Woman in the
Romantic Tradition" received ade
quate production and revealed ilself
as a rather good tragi-melodrama—
whatever that may be.
''The Silver Chain" was a slight
but beautiful interlude. Laura Tap
pan Safford, the author, was sincere
as the Condesa, but could get noth
ing from a beautifully costumed but
very wooden cast.
The third play, "Nail-Broth," was
acted by two individuals who were
straining themselves courageously
to be whimsical—though amusing, it
was immature. —J.S.S.
CYRANO l)E BERGERAC—At the
Geary Theatre, San Francisco.
Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac"
has been revived by Curran and
Belasco with such a marked degree
of splendor and beauty that the pro
duction is going to be hard to
equal.
Richard Bennet's diction and ton
al inflections make the poetry of
Cyrano's tongue and heart as 'con
vincing to the audience as to the
lovely Roxanne. Bennett speaks not
only the Queen's English but also
the language of the most gallant
and tender of lovers.
Against an artful and exquisite
background, Kay Johnson as Rox
anne is truly the flower of her cen
tury grandeur. The costuming
throughout the performance is rich
ly done and finely blended.
If the conduct of the audience is
any indication of the success of a

play, "Cyrano" is easily branded j
classic. With each succeeding scene j
the audience sank into a deepex - ,
tenser, more respectful silence un- I
til, by the time oi' the final act, the j
listeners dared not move. —E.E.H. i
TIIE SEX FABLE—By Edouard I
Bourdet. Brcntano's, New York, j
1931. $2. (At Gordon Straw- !
bridge's,)
For the benefit of those Ameri- !
can visitors during the past Pari
sian season, Le Sexe Faible has j
been translated The Sex Fable—
possibly in the hope of reminding !
them that it was a hit there if some- !
thing less here.
Bourdet's characters are all ridi- j
culous and. for the most part, amus- i
ing. His women are brow-beaters, i
his men kept. One character, a sort I
of dcus ex machina and headwaiter j
combined, directs their destinies so j
as to make the play entertaining.
The play's satire usually bites j
successfully—until M. Bourdet at- j
tempts a post-Menckenian portrait
of the average American in Europe |
--whereupon it falls dismally upon i
its pants bottom and there l'emains j
until the author returns to his mad
Parisians.
Bourdet's contention is that worn- i
en are the dominators. In his play i
the ultima thule of each male char- i
acter is to marry his mistress. But j
the ladies are wily and when the j
play ends only that woman so un- I
fortunate as to have fallen in love '
and married before the first curtain j
is still entangled.
Some of the character drawing is
good but ihe play's amusement rests
chiefly on the wit in its lines. It is j
never bitter and never extremely !
funny. —J.S.S.
