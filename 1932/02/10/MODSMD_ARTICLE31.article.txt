### Bob Wade 
Having been rained out of two ]
practice games, with the Olympic [
Club and tlx? Athens Club, Stan- 1
ford's varsity baseball team takes j
oil the Kenealy Seals in the last
game of the practice season this
afternoon on the local diamond at j
3:30 o'clock.
The Seals are a collection of major
and minor league stars who put in
their spare time before the regular
training season starts playing colle
giate and all-star aggregations
around the Bay region. Last year
they trounced the Indians in the ,
initial practice contest, 8-3.
Lineup Given
Their lineup includes: Hutchin- |
son, first base, formerly with the J
Seals and Missions of the Coast
League; Maloney, second base, for- |
merly with Hollywood of (he same '
League; Joe Cronin, shortstop, of !
the Washington Senators, unoffi- j
eially the most valuable player in
the American League; Eddie Mon- !
tague, third base, of the Cleveland j
Indians; Roy Johnson, of Cleveland, j
who starred in the game here last j
year, eenterfield; Jake Ward, of the
Detroit Tigers, left field; Leo Burns, !
formerly with the Los Angeles Club j
of the Coast League, right field; i
Frank Cox, of the Seattle Indians, \
catcher; Bill Bahr and Spike j
O'Keefe, pitchers.
Broncos Saturday
With the first conference game, j
against Santa Clara's Broncos, com- j
ing up Saturday. Coach Harry Wol- j
ter will probably use a number of j
his prospective varsity horsehiders!
during the course of the nine in- |
nings.
Coach Wolter will start Ernie |
Caddel on the mound, with Jim J
Massey behind the plate. Goodell j
will gel; the call at first base, Vince
Philippi at second, Trautman at
third, Dclmas at shortstop, Gold- !
mann in left field, Rintala in cen
ter, and Campbell and Miles alter- 1
nating in right.
Four May Pitch
Wolter may give all four of his
leading pitchers a chance since none
of them have had much work lately. \
This would mean approximately
two innings apiece for Estes, Stark,
Caddel, and Anderson.
Reports from Santa Clara indicate !
that Coach Walter ?4ai!s will have
a tough outfit to beat when the con
ference ball gets rolling Saturday. â– 
The majority of the collegiate teams i
m the loop have been cheered by
the news that Dan Johnson, premier :
Stanford chucker, has turned pro
fessional, but they may find that
there are others capable of filling
his shoes when Wolter trots out his j
latest creation in defense of the [
honors won last year.
