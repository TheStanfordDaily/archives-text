# INDIAN SWIM SQUAD ENCOUNTERS TOUGH OPPOSITION IN OLYMPIC CLUB MEET
## 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
Contesting a compromise series of
events, varsity swimmers will meet
the Olympic Club team in San
Francisco at 8 o'clock Friday night.
Due largely to the tremendous
strength of the Card outfit in cer
tain of the regular meet events,
three of Friday's events were chosen
by the Clubmen.
Stanford "chose to run" in the
400-yard relay and the 100- and
220-yard freestyle, the Winged O
picking cut the 100-yard backstroke,
100-yard breaststroke, and diving as
iheir string points. Notwithstanding
this compromise agreement, the
Card mermen expect to put up some
pretty strong opposition in all six
events, with the possible exception
of diving.
Water Polo Stiff
Favored to take the swimming
branch of the meet, the Farm boys
are nevertheless expecting a tough
battle in the water polo contest to
be held the same night. Two Olym
pic players and four former Stan
ford men play under the Olympic
Club colors窶馬o mere collection of
beginners. Whitey Burns, last year's
captain, and Paul DeSilva, a mem
ber of last year's Indian team, along
with Ccllette and Fickert, will fight
against their alma mater. With : hem
will be George Mitchell, captain of
the United States water polo team
in the 1928 Olympic Games, and
George Sehroth, who renresented

By Dick Van Wagenen

the U.S. in both the 1924 and 1928
Games.
As to the swimming events,
Clapp, Wiget, Gardner, and McKel
vey v/iil handle the relay, saving
Captain Booth for the backstroke, j
W'th Tebbetts out of the tank with
a pulled ligament, Booth is relied
upon to produce all he can in this
event. The other two Stanford
chosen events, the 100 and 220,
,-hould i.et at least two firsts and
two seconds, McKelvey and Gard
ner in the former, and Clapp and
Wiget in the latter.
Bob Clark will act as the Car
dinal dark horse in the breaststroke,
and may pull a surprise in this
Olympic Club event, although the
competition is unusually strong. The
Northerners boast Benner, Pacific j
Association champion, and Burns, ;
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate record- I
holder, who will be no easy meat i
for Clark, and probably a little j
faster company than he would like.
Throndson to Dive
Boo!he will have Hargraves, Pa-' :
eific Association champion, to argue |
with in the backstroke, a pretty'
heavy demand on his ability. Div
ing is bound to be the point-getter
for th.? Clubmen, who boast
Throndson, 1930 Stanford captain
and former national intercollegiate
champio::, and Sanford, a high-class
diver.
'Ladies' night will be observed for
this meet, and the public is invited.

Clapp, Wiget, Gardner, and McKel
vey v/iil handle the relay, saving
Captain Booth for the backstroke, j
W'th Tebbetts out of the tank with
a pulled ligament, Booth is relied
upon to produce all he can in this
event. The other two Stanford
chosen events, the 100 and 220,
,-hould i.et at least two firsts and
two seconds, McKelvey and Gard
ner in the former, and Clapp and
Wiget in the latter.
Bob Clark will act as the Car
dinal dark horse in the breaststroke,
and may pull a surprise in this
Olympic Club event, although the
competition is unusually strong. The
Northerners boast Benner, Pacific j
Association champion, and Burns, ;
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate record- I
holder, who will be no easy meat i
for Clark, and probably a little j
faster company than he would like.
Throndson to Dive
Boo!he will have Hargraves, Pa-' :
eific Association champion, to argue |
with in the backstroke, a pretty'
heavy demand on his ability. Div
ing is bound to be the point-getter
for th.? Clubmen, who boast
Throndson, 1930 Stanford captain
and former national intercollegiate
champio::, and Sanford, a high-class
diver.
'Ladies' night will be observed for
this meet, and the public is invited.
Contesting a compromise series of
events, varsity swimmers will meet
the Olympic Club team in San
Francisco at 8 o'clock Friday night.
Due largely to the tremendous
strength of the Card outfit in cer
tain of the regular meet events,
three of Friday's events were chosen
by the Clubmen.
Stanford "chose to run" in the
400-yard relay and the 100- and
220-yard freestyle, the Winged O
picking cut the 100-yard backstroke,
100-yard breaststroke, and diving as
iheir string points. Notwithstanding
this compromise agreement, the
Card mermen expect to put up some
pretty strong opposition in all six
events, with the possible exception
of diving.
Water Polo Stiff
Favored to take the swimming
branch of the meet, the Farm boys
are nevertheless expecting a tough
battle in the water polo contest to
be held the same night. Two Olym
pic players and four former Stan
ford men play under the Olympic
Club colors窶馬o mere collection of
beginners. Whitey Burns, last year's
captain, and Paul DeSilva, a mem
ber of last year's Indian team, along
with Ccllette and Fickert, will fight
against their alma mater. With : hem
will be George Mitchell, captain of
the United States water polo team
in the 1928 Olympic Games, and
George Sehroth, who renresented

the U.S. in both the 1924 and 1928
Games.
