## 
### 
First- and second-string freshman
basketball players battled through
a full hcur and a quarter scrimmage
last night, and the showing of men
in the long session left the starting
lin< up lor the second game of the
annual Stanford-California Little
Big Series very much in doubt.
Jim Trompas, Jack Butte, Johnny
Mack, and Jim Savage, all reserve
players, played good steady games,
and may yet get their chance at
playing before the 8000 fans who
will witness Saturday night's en
counter.
Tom Sales, the Phil MofTatt (for
looks) of the hoop squad, made his
reappearance on the court yester
day, and looked as though he had
benefited from hi.s week's layoff.
Stalene:-:,-; on the basketball court is
as bad as in the boxing ring or on
the track, and Sales wisely took a
few days- of! before it was too late.
A possible lineup for Friday might
include Tom Kelly, center, Frank
Cox and Jim Trompas, forwards,
Johnny Mack and Jim Savage,
guards, and this five, with the cries
of the Don Cossacks and the groans
of the defeated Cal Aggie fighters
still ringing in the Pavilion dark
corners, may give the Galileans a
urprising tomahawking.
