LAKE PLACID, N.Y., Feb. 9. </P)
—Reto Capadrutt, slim young Swiss
with the face of a cherub, and
nerves of steel—the boy they're all
afraid of—shot his two-man bob
down the tortuous side of Mt. Van
Hoevenburg twice in world record
time today to distance all but the
shrewdest of Yankee opposition in
the greatest of all winter Olympic
sports.
It was the start of the mad pur
suit with death down the rock
studded mountainside, the first two
heats of the two-man bobsled com-: .
petition. It took all the ingenuity |
Hubert Stevens, world record hold- [
er and ace of the United States i
forces, could muster to keep within
shouting distance of the , brilliant
young sophomore from the Univer
sity of Zurich.
As it was, Stevens salvaged the
world record again out of the
breath-taking tussle on the tower- !
ing mountain, finishing the day with !
a dazzling, bullet-like dash on !
blow-torch heated runners, through j
the twenty-five numbing curves of |
the snow-crusted ice chute in 2 \
minutes, 4.27 seconds, as compared j
with his world mark at the start of j
the day, 2:09.
