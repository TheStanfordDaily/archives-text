# OLD SOL LURES CINDER MEN TO TRACK WORKOUT
## Ellington Sends Distance Runners On Strenuous Trip Around Oval 
### 
By Dick Strouse
Finally answering the combined
prayers of Dink Templeton, Bill
Ellington, and the Stanford track
team, a modest track conditioner
known as Oid Sol at last decided to
show his face around the campus
and as a result, the Indian cindef
artists had their first real chance to
work out yesterday for the first
time in two weeks.
Assistant Coach Ellington took
advantage of the improved weather
to send his distance men on several
fruitless trips around the track. The
| workout took the form of what may
I best be called "stops and starts." In
! this training jaunt, which is a
Templeton creation, the boys run
the curves and walk the straight
aways of the track, and after they
have continued these pleasure
jaunts for a total distance of two
miles, they are invariably ready to
call it a day—if not a week or a
j month.
Among the participants in yes
| terday's walking-running race were
i Sam Eastman, Phil Moretin, and Al
| Storms. In spite of all rumors to the
j contrary, the latter is actually at-
I tending Stanford and plans to run
i for Coach Dink Templeton this
j spring.
I Ellington spent some time with
j the weight men, and it appears more
j and more evident daily that Lyman,
j Laborde, "a" Gray and "e" Grey
| should be about the best of the
nation's collegiate shot-putters. And
this in spite of the verbal threat of
Bob Hall of U.S.C. to break the
world's shot-put record.
