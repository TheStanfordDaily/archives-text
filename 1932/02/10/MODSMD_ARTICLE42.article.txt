STANFORD GOLFERS will again |
be favored to capture first honors
when divots fly in the annual coast '
intercollegiate tourney at Pebble i
Beach this week-end.
Harry Eichelberger, winner of the !
event last year, will be back <to de-

fend his title, j
while the prin
cipal threats in I
his way are;
other Indian!
mashie-wielders, I
Charlie Seaver, i
Hellman, an d
Hawley.
Among other i
institutions who I
will be rep re- ■
sen ted in thej
meet are Cali- |

fornia, Santa Clara, U.S.C., and i
j U.C.L.A.
Santa Clara is sending a strong!
entry in the person of Ned Strong, j
' Jr., a young feller who has made I
j quite a name for himself in Mon- i
I terey peninsula tournaments. Louis j
! Bastenchury is another Bronco j
{ threat.
Winston Fuller and Bud Law
son will he up from U.S.C. while
it is possible that Don Moe and
Vincent Dolp, the well-known
aces from the Northwest, will
be entered.
i Eighteen-hole qualifying rounds :
i will be played on Thursday, with j
1(5 to qualify for match play on j
! Friday and Saturday.
The following week-end Seaver, j
Eichelberger, and Hawley will en
ter the San Francisco municipal !
i tourney, to be played over the Lin-
I coin Park course. Lawson Little, j
J former Stanford player who is noti!
! in school this year, and Malcolm
' McNaughton, graduate divoter, will
also participate.
SEVERAL SCRIBES wandered I
down to the Pavilion yesterday to '
; see what Coach John Bunn was
doing with the remnants of what
: was once a promising basketball
team.
Only 11 of the regulars were
in sight, hut a newcomer was
showing flashes of brilliance.
"Say," remarked somebody,
1 "where the heck has that guy

been all the time? He looks like
varsity material to me."
Then he got a good look at
the "newcomer"—it was Bunn
himself.

WHILE OTHER Bay Region in- '
stitutions go merrily on with their j
plans /or interseetional football '
games, the Stanford schedule re- \
mains without such a contest for !
the first time in many seasons. The j
postponement of the first North- i
western game is the principal rea
son.
V/hilj the schedule is filled solid
from September 17 to the Big Game !
on November 19, it is still possible j
that a post-season tilt might be ar- j
ranged. When, where, and with j
whom are unanswerable questions j
at this time, however.

SPEAKING OF FOOTBALL,;

Stanford is acquiring quite a player !
m the form of Milo Quissling, who
will transfer to Stanford from San !
Mateo Junior College in time for |
spring practice.
It will be remembered that a
San Mateo lad — one I lank
Schaidach—did a lot of damage
to the Indian cause in the Big
Game last fall. Quissling is also
a halfback, and Coach Murius
McFadden of the peninsula in
stitution characterizes him as
belter than Hank. —L.M.C. i

i Eighteen-hole qualifying rounds :

1(5 to qualify for match play on j
! Friday and Saturday.
The following week-end Seaver, j

ter the San Francisco municipal !

SEVERAL SCRIBES wandered I
down to the Pavilion yesterday to '
; see what Coach John Bunn was
doing with the remnants of what
: was once a promising basketball
team.
Only 11 of the regulars were
in sight, hut a newcomer was
showing flashes of brilliance.
"Say," remarked somebody,
1 "where the heck has that guy

been all the time? He looks like
varsity material to me."
Then he got a good look at
the "newcomer"—it was Bunn
himself.

WHILE OTHER Bay Region in- '
stitutions go merrily on with their j
plans /or interseetional football '
games, the Stanford schedule re- \
mains without such a contest for !
the first time in many seasons. The j
postponement of the first North- i
western game is the principal rea
son.
V/hilj the schedule is filled solid
from September 17 to the Big Game !
on November 19, it is still possible j
that a post-season tilt might be ar- j
ranged. When, where, and with j
whom are unanswerable questions j
at this time, however.

SPEAKING OF FOOTBALL,;

Stanford is acquiring quite a player !
m the form of Milo Quissling, who
will transfer to Stanford from San !
Mateo Junior College in time for |
spring practice.
It will be remembered that a
San Mateo lad — one I lank
Schaidach—did a lot of damage
to the Indian cause in the Big
Game last fall. Quissling is also
a halfback, and Coach Murius
McFadden of the peninsula in
stitution characterizes him as
belter than Hank. —L.M.C. i
