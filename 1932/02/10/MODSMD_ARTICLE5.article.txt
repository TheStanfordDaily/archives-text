# CAMERA WIZARD IN MEXICO TALK
## Clatworthy Shows Slides For First Time 
### 
Illustrating his lecture on Mexico j
with the first natural color slides j
to be shown in this country, Fred i
P. Clatworthy, noted landscape pho- I
tographer, took his Stanford audi
ence along the trail of the Spanish j
conquerors of the continent during
his talk here last night.
Mexico, he said, will be the most
interesting country in the world i
during the next few years for j
archaeologists and students of social i
evolution. Paiins of the work of the
greatest builders since Rome, the ,
Spaniards, are being uncovered !
throughout the country, he showed, I
one pyramid being almost as large '
as the greatest in Egypt, and one j
as yet uncovered, is twice its size, j
Tells U.S. Influence
Art, agriculture, tribal customs,
old and modern cities, and Ameri
can influences were reviewed by
Clatworthy.
Tracing the course of explorers j
from the east coast of Mexico to the 1
west coast of the United States, the ;
speaker gave a pictorial history of I
the country as well as dispelled !
popular impressions that Mexico is '
a tropical land of poverty, disease, j
revolution, and retrogression.
Sees Development
Pointing out that the unexploited ;
mineral deposits of the country are 1
the largest on the continent, he '
stated that the next few years would '
see a phenomenal development of j
Mexico's natural resources, as well J
as an increased economic and social |
interest in the country.
Clatworthy has spent fifteen years i
in research and experimentation, j
and has finally perfected the process I
of photographing natural colors on ;
glass plates, but no method has :
been devised for transferring the j
positive impression to paper.
