# BLACKMAN TO TALK ON PIONEERS BEFORE S.C.A. OPEN FORUM
## 
### 
Speaking on "Pioneers, Past,
Present, and Future," O. H. Black
man, lecturer in political science,
will open the weekly forum in the
lobby of the Stanford Christian As
sociation tonight at 7 o'clock. All
students may attend, and the meet
ing will end at 8 o'clock, so as not
to conflict with the concert program.
In addition to his political science
work, Blackman teaches a class in
advertising problems, and is a
member of the Vocational Guidance
Committee. Before coming to Stan
ford he served as advertising agent
for a company of his own, and later
was associate editor of Collier's
magazine, to which he has often
contributed.
Blackman's talk is on the roman
tic age of pioneering, which is not
past, he declares, saying that the
world has turned corner, and youth
faces a new conquest. He will point
cut these new opportunities for col
lege people.
