WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. (/P)
Congressional leaders agreed with
President Hoover today on a new
legislative drive for better times di
rected at freeing billions of sound
securities for active credit use.
The new emergency measures
which will be pushed simultaneous
ly and immediately in the Senate
and House also propose to make
serviceable nearly one billion dol
lars of the Treasury's gold supply
not now needed for reserve.
Senator Glass (D., Va.), will
sponsor the bill in the Senate.
Chairman Steagall of the Demo
cratic House Banking Committee,
will father it in the House. Repub
lican and Democratic leaders of the
Senate and House agreed to give it
right of way.
The bill, almost.drafted, opens the
doors of the Federal Reserve system
to new securities held by the banks
which are now eligible for red is -
counting, and by this step frozen
credits may be loosened at once.
The legislation is supplementing
the two billion dollar Reconstruction
Finance Corporation, now going into
operation.
By releasing a billion dollars in
free gold, of course, the way is
opened to an expansion of the cur
rency if it is needed. The financial
leaders say this is not needed if a
billion and a half dollars in hoarded
money is returned to circulation by
the people.
Exccss Gold Serviceable
A joint statement issued tonight
by the legislators said: "This pro
posed amendment would, when the
Federal Reserve Board deems it de
sirable in the public interest, have
the effect of making all the assets
acquired by the Reserve banks un
der the present provisions of the
law available for not to exceed one
year as collateral for Federal Re
serve notes in addition to the 40
per cent gold reserve, thus making
the excess gold serviceable.
"This provision will have the ef
fect of giving greater flexibility to
the Federal Reserve operations. It
will make the system's large supply
of gold more useful as a basis for
credit. It will at once increase the
system's free gold by nearly one
billion dollars.
