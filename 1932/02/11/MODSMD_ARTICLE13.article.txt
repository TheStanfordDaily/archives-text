withstanding the unfortunate situa- |
tion in the Far East, Japan is as j
eager as ever to further the cause j
of disarmament."
Luke Warm Reception

ceived in luke warm fashion in con- |
trast with the ovation accorded l
Dino Grandi, Italian Foreign Minis- i
ter, who presented to the delegates J
a broad program for lessening the j
burden of war preparations.
Grandi's Proposal
Signor Grandi, the "baby of the j
conference," advocated widening the j
London naval agreement by the in- j
elusion of France and Italy and I
promised his country's support to- i
ward that end. He stated Italy's j
willingness to abolish capital ships, \
submarines, and bombing planes, j
and demanded that the former al- j
lies disarm in the same measure as !
Germany has been forced to do. j

the French proposal that all the !
nations contribute to an effective ;
international police force to be con- i
trolled by the League of Nations.
