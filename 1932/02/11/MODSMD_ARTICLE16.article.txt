# PACKED HOUSE GIVES COSSACK GREAT OVATION
## Rollicking Soldier Airs And Folk Melodies Receive Rousing Hand 
### 
Sounding like a great organ
played by the dynamic little leader,
Serge JarofT, and displaying a tech
nique trained to hair-trigger perfec
tion, a flawless harmony and a wide
range of notes, the Don Cossack
Russian Male Chorus last night pre
sented a program of native song.s
before a wildly enthusiastic audi
ence in the Pavilion.
The "Song of the Don Cossacks,"
punctuated with shrill whistles and
yells, wild and realistic, and the
picturesque Russian dance by two
members of the chorus, which fol
lowed, climaxed the program, and
brought tremendous applause and
stamping from an audience unwill
ing to leave without hearing more.
Volga Boat Song
The crescendo and diminuendo
passages of the Volga Boat Song
displayed the ability of the chorus
to produce very soft, pianissimo and
vigorous fortissimo effects. The de
scriptive cry of the boatmen, "Ay,
Ookhnem!" repeated in various in
tonations, brought clearly before th«»
mind of the listener a picture of the
boatmen bending over their labor
and of the rhythmic roll of the
waves of the great river.
Especially beautiful in diminuendo
and crescendo effects was ihe
prayer, "Have Mercy on Us, O
Lord!" by Lvovsky. Though the song
was composed of a single phrase
repeated forty times, it was any
thing but monotonous.
The two fiery gypsy songs, "Black
Eyes" and "The Two Guitars," ar
ranged by C. Shvedoff, were un
usually realistic. The effect of the
beating Balaika drum in the former
and the strumming guitars in the
latter could not have* been more
natural if the instruments them
selves had been played upon.
Like Organ
A volume of humming, resem
bling the playing of an organ, ac
companied the solo parts of many
of the songs. Male 'choruses are
usually characterized by vigor alone,
but the Don Cossacks are capable
of producing the faintest and soft
est sounds as well as the most in
tense and fiery; of reaching high
falsetto and soprano notes which
are usually rendered only by wom
en's voices, as well as the deepest
and most cavernous bass tones.
Spiritual intensity, overwhelming
jubilance, deep emotion, thunderous
roars, mere whispers, rich over
tures—all characterized the music
brought forth by the energetic little
leader of the Cossack chorus. The
slightest move of Jaroff's finger, a
curt gesture of his hand, the tipping
of his head, or a rising on his toes
each had its meaning to the 36 stal
wart singers arranged in a double
semicircle on the platform, who
kept their eyes on the diminutive
leader.

of his head, or a rising on his toes
each had its meaning to the 36 stal
wart singers arranged in a double
semicircle on the platform, who
kept their eyes on the diminutive
leader.
Sounding like a great organ
played by the dynamic little leader,
Serge JarofT, and displaying a tech
nique trained to hair-trigger perfec
tion, a flawless harmony and a wide
range of notes, the Don Cossack
Russian Male Chorus last night pre
sented a program of native song.s
before a wildly enthusiastic audi
ence in the Pavilion.
The "Song of the Don Cossacks,"
punctuated with shrill whistles and
yells, wild and realistic, and the
picturesque Russian dance by two
members of the chorus, which fol
lowed, climaxed the program, and
brought tremendous applause and
stamping from an audience unwill
ing to leave without hearing more.
Volga Boat Song
The crescendo and diminuendo
passages of the Volga Boat Song
displayed the ability of the chorus
to produce very soft, pianissimo and
vigorous fortissimo effects. The de
scriptive cry of the boatmen, "Ay,
Ookhnem!" repeated in various in
tonations, brought clearly before th«»
mind of the listener a picture of the
boatmen bending over their labor
and of the rhythmic roll of the
waves of the great river.
Especially beautiful in diminuendo
and crescendo effects was ihe
prayer, "Have Mercy on Us, O
Lord!" by Lvovsky. Though the song
was composed of a single phrase
repeated forty times, it was any
thing but monotonous.
The two fiery gypsy songs, "Black
Eyes" and "The Two Guitars," ar
ranged by C. Shvedoff, were un
usually realistic. The effect of the
beating Balaika drum in the former
and the strumming guitars in the
latter could not have* been more
natural if the instruments them
selves had been played upon.
Like Organ
A volume of humming, resem
bling the playing of an organ, ac
companied the solo parts of many
of the songs. Male 'choruses are
usually characterized by vigor alone,
but the Don Cossacks are capable
of producing the faintest and soft
est sounds as well as the most in
tense and fiery; of reaching high
falsetto and soprano notes which
are usually rendered only by wom
en's voices, as well as the deepest
and most cavernous bass tones.
Spiritual intensity, overwhelming
jubilance, deep emotion, thunderous
roars, mere whispers, rich over
tures—all characterized the music
brought forth by the energetic little
leader of the Cossack chorus. The
slightest move of Jaroff's finger, a
curt gesture of his hand, the tipping
of his head, or a rising on his toes
each had its meaning to the 36 stal
wart singers arranged in a double
semicircle on the platform, who
