### 
lIANGHAI, Feb. 11. I/P)â€”The greatest concentration of guns, man
power, and ammunition of the entire Shanghai-Woosung engagement
was in progress this morning as the Japanese and the Chinese prepared
to light it out to the finish.

The troops were massed about the Woosung forts, where the Chinese
have stood up for a week under almost continued bombardment and aerial
attack. The concentration movement was carried out under the cover of
darkness last night and early this morning. Passengers aboard steamships
from Japan that docked at Shanghai late Wednesday said they had passed
a do/en Japanese troop ships. Neutral sources here received a code

message from Japan saying two
army divisions, about 2(1.000 men
had embarked for the front.
Chinese Set
The Chinese got ready for the big !
push by draining their reserve !
troops from the trench lines to the -
rear of their position in Chapei.
In the sector about the North
Station only two lines of trenches '
remained manned. A gap of half a
mile existed between the Chinese |
front and the support lines after the
shift had been completed.
Japanese field pieces, unloaded
from ships in the Whangpoo, were :
picked up from the Shanghai docks
by trucks that rumbled away to the !
north, and both Japanese and Chi
nese combed the Shanghai area for
materials of war.
Japanese trucks rushed bales of
American cotton into the Woosung
sector to protect strong points from
Chinese machine guns and artillery.
Canton advices said guns and
ammunition had been shipped and
that General Chen Chi-tang, com- i
mander-in-chief of the First Army,
had promised additional financial '
support for the defenders of Shang
hai.
Americans Periled
Although the Shanghai Interna
tional Settlement was convinced
that the next big action would |
come at Woosung there was con- j
I siderable apprehension, and new i
sandbag barricades and barbed wire
entanglements were erected by
United States marines, members of
the 31st United States Infantry and
other foreign troops.
