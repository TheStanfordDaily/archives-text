# SAFFORD CONTINUES MENDELSSOHN MUSIC IN TODAY'S RECITAL
## 
### 
Charles L. Safford, visiting organ
ist, will continue with his composi
tions selected from the old masters
in his organ recital this afternoon at
5:10 o'clock in the Stanford Me
morial Church.
'Adagio in G Major" by Men
delssohn will be one of the more
interesting. Mendelssohn was a
great admirer of John Sebastian
Bach, and this selection was only
one in a large number which was
calculated to renew interest in the
compositions of the great master.
This adagio is taken from a sonata
for violoncello and piano. It adapts
itself directly to the organ, as it is
a free recitative written against a
chorale.
The remainder of the program
will be composed of the following
numbers:
Prelude and Fugue in E Flat..Bach
Adagio in G Major... .Mendelssohn
Second Movement, Symphony
No. 3 Tschaikowsky
Finale, Sonata in A Minor
Felix Borowski
