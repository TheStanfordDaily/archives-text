# STANFORD BALL SQUAD BLANKS KENEALY SEALS
## Former Big Leaguers Held To Four Bingles By Caddel, Estes INDIANS GRAB 4-0 GAME Campbell, Philippi, Rintala Score Cardinal Runs 
### Bob Wade 
Shutting out a team that boasted
lour major league stars, and as
! many from the minors, the Stan
| ford varsity baseball outfit closed
its practice schedule with a 4-0 de
i feat of ihe Kenealy Seals yesterday
| on the local ball lot.
■ A single in the first by Johnson of
the Detroit Tigers, one in the third
I by Hutchinson of the Seals, another
in the fifth by Joe Cronin of the
Washington Senators, the American
i League's most valuable player, and
; a fourth bingle in jthe eighth by
Jake Ward of the Cleveland Indians
was the best that the Dig Leaguers
could do with the combined offer
ings of Caddel and Estes.
Stanford scored first in the fourth
inning, after Campbell and Philippi
had walked, when Fred Goodell
drove a hard single into right field.
Gerrin's relay of Ward's throw was
late as Campbell slid in with the
first Indian marker.
The Redshirts scored again in the
. fifth when Rintala caught hold of
| one of Bahr's slants and drove it
far beyond Roy Johnson, fleet De
! troit center fielder. The blow was
' Rintala's lone hit of the day, but it
was enough to send the second Seal
chucker to the showers.
Campbell reached first in the
i eighth when Gerrin dropped Char
lie Montague's throw from short.
Philippi doubled between Johnson
I and Ward to advance Campbell to
; third, and after Goodell had fanned,
Trautman drove in two runs with a
hard double down the third-base
: line.
That ended the fireworks as Estes
shut out the Seals in one-two-three
1 order in the ninth.
Big Ernie Caddel had his fast ball
: under control even better than in
! the game against the Olympic Club
two weeks ago. If he keeps up his
j present good work the rest of the
: league will have a tough time beat-
I ing the Indians when the conference
j gets under way. Paired with Estes'
I slow curve in the same game, Cad-
I 'del's speed makes for an effective
{ change of. pace.
