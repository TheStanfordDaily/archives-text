# JINXED, THEY FIGHT ON

i I is dangerous business for a loser to moan about
"tough luck." Whether justified or not, in so doing he lays
himself open to scathing denunciation from winners in the
same field of endeavor, who hear and cry, "sour grapes,"
"alibi," and "poor loser," not realizing that it is more dif
ficult to win gracefully than to lose in the same manner.
With lull realization that these words will be misin
terpreted on some quarters, this tribute is being written to
the hardest-fighting, most courageous coach and basket
ball team ever to perform for Stanford in the face of a
series of the worst breaks that ever dogged a sports organ
ization on the Farm.
At the start of the school year, hoop prospects were the
brightest seen here in years. Phil Mofl'att, all-coast forward
of the preceeding season considered remaining for another
year; Keith Topping, one of the greatest sophomore pros
pects in Stanford history was on hand; Reg Meade, a "na
tural" at forward looked toward his best season of play;
AI Norgard and Frenchy La Combe, two junior college
stars, had enrolled and were ready for actionâ€”everything
was set for a big Red year.
And now, on the eve of the second California game, a
mere skeleton of the team that could have been remains.
Two oi these men are out of school, one is definitely lost
for the rest of the season, and the other two are not in
shape to start Saturday night. Beginning last quarter when
Mofl'att announced that he would graduate, a combination
of "breaks" of the worst sort piled up steadily until the
final blow fell last week-end in injuries to La Combe and
Norgard, two pi liars of Indian basketball strength.
Yet John Runn still smiles. He has no alibis. Facing
overwhelming odds, he goes quietly to work preparing to
"take" the Rears. And his team is behind him to a man.
