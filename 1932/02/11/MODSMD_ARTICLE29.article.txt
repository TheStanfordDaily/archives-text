Sarcasm is a dangerous weapon. One Daily editorial
writer, a sadder but wiser man, now appreciates how very,
very true that statement is. And he also realizes that you
can too! some of the people a good part of the time, even
when you aren't trying lo do so.

Various unexpected comments around the campus, and
a communication to the editor, which unfortunately cannot
he printed because the author's name cannot be verified in
the Hawlout, have brought these truths home to the un
fortunate editorial writer in question. Having been struck
by the howling inconsistency of Japanese diplomatic state
ments with the actions of Japan's forces, this budding
journalist concocted what he thought was a workmanlike
piece of tolerably obvious irony, pointing out the said hu
morous inconsistency.
Hut 10, and behold! Serious readers, including the
campus opinion writer, took one glance at the editorial,
which, headed "Maligned Japan," ran in Tuesday's edition
of the Daily, and promptly rushed to congratulate or con
demn the Daily upon its "pro-Japanese" policy. He it said
here and now that the edit was anything but "pro-Japa
nese."
Alas and alack for the once-famed western apprecia
tion of the double meaning! .Must all the wealth of litera
ture to be obtained from sarcasm be consigned to oblivion
because there are no readers capable of appreciating it?
No, a thousand times no! .Must we draw diagrams, provide
pictorial illustrations, label our productions "ironical," in
order to save ourselves from the thunders of an unenlight
ened public? A hundred Chappie cohorts rise and answer
"no."
Look again, ye serious ones; till that glitters is not gold.
