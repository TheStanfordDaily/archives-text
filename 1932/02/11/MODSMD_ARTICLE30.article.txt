# FOUR PER CENT BEER
## 
### 
Dean Clarence W. Mcndell of Yale University, in advo
cating the* legalization of four per cent beer, believes that
the prohibition laws are instilling in college students an
unconscious deep-seated contempt for law in general, their
lack of respect for liquor regulations being transferee! to
other spheres.
It cannot be doubted that the Kighteenth Amendment
has produced a decided disrespect for law, not only among
the youth of the country but also the older generations.
Hut that taking such a half-hearted step as legalizing four
per cent beer would be a cure for these social evils is hard
to believe, and that students drink hard liquor because
they cannot openly drink practically non-intoxicating beer
is ridiculous. If some better idea for eliminating the evils
of prohibition cannot be suggested than raising slightly
the alcoholic content of beer, the situation had better be
left as is.
