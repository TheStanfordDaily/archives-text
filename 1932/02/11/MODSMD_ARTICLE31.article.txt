# BULL SESSION
## WONDERFUL, ROOSEVELT, WONDERFUL!

! 1920 was impossible; and if pos
i cible, very cowardly and an insult
to his dead chief, Woodrow Wilson,
jSo says Roosevelt in a recent
j speech—that he still favors the Wil
son League, but. that the League is
I no longer the Wilson League, and
■ therefore he is against our entrance
j into it.
One of the smartest bits of poli
, tics that has graced the national
j stage in many a day—infinitely bet
ler than Baker's statement discussed
k;st week is this "out" by the fore
' most Democratic possibility. With
i one hand, he scoops up the Wilson
l iies; and yet with the other, he
j pats the broad backs of the na-
J tionalists. He stands by his past
I utterances of 1920 and yet, without
! shifting a foot, he has turned com
] pletely around and is basking in
i Ihe warm glow of the public's ap-
I proval.
I
j Hoover was fortunate in that his
j past in politics dealt solely with
I non-controversial issues like feeding
I the Belgians and aiding American
j business. But if Franklin Roosevelt
| can explain away prohibition trou
j bles as well as he has his League
j problem, then the Republicans can
i expect a real race in 1932. All that
j assumes, however, that Roosevelt
j can beat Smith, Baker, Ritchie, and
J the rest and get the nomination—
| which is a mighty big assumption.

The longer a man stays in poli- !
tics, the worse his chances become j
for being elected President. For 1 he
longer he is in politics, the more j
issues he has to face and the more j
votes he stands to lose. Any that i
are planning to run for the highest, j
office in the land had better comb !
their record with a magnifying '
glass; every little thing, every j
chance statement will be discovered .
and spread on every front page in
America. Franklin D. Roosevelt |
knew that; and the more he thought \
about it, the more he worried.
i
He was worried, for in 1920 when !
he was a candidate for the vice- i
presidency, he had campaigned
loudly for the League of Nations.
And now, ihe League is like un-cut
dollar gin—instant death. It was
political suicide in 1920, too; but ;
people didn't know it then. But now j
they do, and poor Roosevelt must I
have perspired freely when he j
would awaken in the middle of the j
night and see Hearst spreading 1920 j
speeches all over his papers. The I
New York governor knew that \
George Washington reincarnated !
couldn't win with the League mill- J
stone around his neck.
But then there came a savior. I
Who it was is not known. He—and
when in doubt everybody is he—
must have been as welcome as clear
skies at Stanford. To solve the di
lemna was necessary. To repudiate '
! 1920 was impossible; and if pos

The longer a man stays in poli- !
tics, the worse his chances become j
for being elected President. For 1 he
longer he is in politics, the more j
issues he has to face and the more j
votes he stands to lose. Any that i
are planning to run for the highest, j
office in the land had better comb !
their record with a magnifying '
glass; every little thing, every j
chance statement will be discovered .
and spread on every front page in
America. Franklin D. Roosevelt |
knew that; and the more he thought \
about it, the more he worried.
i
He was worried, for in 1920 when !
he was a candidate for the vice- i
presidency, he had campaigned
loudly for the League of Nations.
And now, ihe League is like un-cut
dollar gin—instant death. It was
political suicide in 1920, too; but ;
people didn't know it then. But now j
they do, and poor Roosevelt must I
have perspired freely when he j
would awaken in the middle of the j
night and see Hearst spreading 1920 j
speeches all over his papers. The I
New York governor knew that \
George Washington reincarnated !
couldn't win with the League mill- J
stone around his neck.
But then there came a savior. I
Who it was is not known. He—and
when in doubt everybody is he—
must have been as welcome as clear
skies at Stanford. To solve the di
lemna was necessary. To repudiate '
! 1920 was impossible; and if pos
i cible, very cowardly and an insult
to his dead chief, Woodrow Wilson,
jSo says Roosevelt in a recent
j speech—that he still favors the Wil
son League, but. that the League is
I no longer the Wilson League, and
■ therefore he is against our entrance
j into it.
One of the smartest bits of poli
, tics that has graced the national
j stage in many a day—infinitely bet
ler than Baker's statement discussed
k;st week is this "out" by the fore
' most Democratic possibility. With
i one hand, he scoops up the Wilson
l iies; and yet with the other, he
j pats the broad backs of the na-
J tionalists. He stands by his past
I utterances of 1920 and yet, without
! shifting a foot, he has turned com
] pletely around and is basking in
i Ihe warm glow of the public's ap-
I proval.
