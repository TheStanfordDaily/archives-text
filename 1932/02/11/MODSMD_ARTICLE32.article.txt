UNION DEPOT—At (lie Stanford
Theatre.
Now we know what the manage
ment had in mind when he billed
, this picture as "different." It is. It's
good. And you'll like it.
Even if producers usually don't
i call a spade a spade—unless it's a
heart, everything takes place in or
J around a big city railroad station.
1 From the moment young Doug
| Fairbanks, just out of a city hoose-
I gow after a 10-day roost there on
I a vagrancy charge, picks out a suit
| and some money from somebody
I else's valise things boom along in
j great style. For one thing he con
i tinues the picking habit and—ahem,
encounters a young but penniless
' chorus girl (Joan Blondell). For
i Enother Junior gets into a mess
| about a violin case with a lot of
j counterfeit money and it looks
j pretty bad for our hero until prac
-1 tically the last 100 feet of film. For
! cnce, too, everybody is to be con
! gratulated, including the director
j who probably kept the hero from
unhappiness by keeping him single.

TOMORROW AND TOMORROW—

i
At the Varsity Theatre.
"Tomorrow and Tomorrow," Philip
1 Barry's play which came very near
! to winning the Pulitzer prize last
j year, comes equally near to being
' one of the few i*eally fine and sin
i cere films of the yeai*. While lack
! ing in the sparkle and nonsense of
| ''Holiday," the dialogue is charac
i terized by Barry's usual natural
; ness, and there are numerous splen
! did scenes, notably the final scene
! betwen Ruth Chatterton and Paul
! Lukas. The film is essentially a seri
l ous one, remarkably faithful to the
| original play. Ruth Chatterton
! emerges from a recent slump by her
i interpretation of Eve Redman, a
j charming and sensitive woman
whom she portrays with rare un
-1 derstanding. Eve Redman's one de
i sire is to have a child, and this
i happiness comes to her through
Nicholas Hay, splendidly played by
Paul Lukas. In the role of Gail
Redman, the husband, the late Rob
! ert Ames contributed the best and
last performance of his career. Tad
I Alexander as the son was excellent.
There is a corking good animated
cartoon, and the comedy—well, the
] cartoon was good, anyhow. —E.C.
