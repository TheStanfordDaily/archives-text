# MASTERS TELLS COSTS B.A.C. Sheep Are $58 Loss PERDICTS TIGHT YEAR
## 
### 
Last year the B.A.C. sheep were
j operated at a net loss of $58. It
j cost $3,900 to wash and iron the
| University's athletic laundry. Only
j $6,100 was spent on equipment (as
compared with U.S.C.'s $10,000) but
! the expenses of competition were
$20,328, and $4,600 was spent in
I keeping the playing fields in con
i dition.
] In this manner does the annual
i football income dwindle away, A1
' Masters, B.A.C. manager, told the
j Palo Alto Lions Club yesterday,
j And all this is only a drop in the
I bucket in comparison with the
I 5100,752 paid out in coaches' and
I directors' salaries during the year,
i while the $5,613 spent in mailing out
1 tickets is quite incidental.
And Masters wound up his talk
| by saying that this year it is going
j to be worse because fewer people
! are going to go to football games
1 and they are going to pay less.
