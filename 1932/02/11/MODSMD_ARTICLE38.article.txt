## AGAIN THE INDIAN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Abe MellinkofT wrote Mon- i
day under the title of the Bull Ses- j
sion a justly fair criticism of the i
idea of a statue of an Indian war- |
rior now to be seen in the lobby I
of the Stanford Union, symbolic of I
Stanford's athletic prowess and
symbolic of her men. But if not in
letter, at least in spirit, Mr. Mellin- j
koff states his thumbs-down edict j
as representative of the opinion of s
Stanford's student body.
He goes on to say that "Not so I
long ago, we used to be the 'Cards' j
or the Cardinals; now we are the j
'Indians'; next year it is difficult ,
to say what we will be."
Not so difficult, Mr. MellinkofT, j
when we turn to the Ex Committee i
Notes ol November 25, 1930, and '
read that:
"Whereas the Indian has long
been unofficially recognized as the i
symbol of Stanford and its Spirit, |
and
"Whereas there has never been !
any official designation of a Stan
ford symbol, be it hereby
"Resolved that the Executive j
Committee adopt the Indian as the \
symbol of Stanford."
The Indian warrior is a historical j
figure, older than Stanford or any :
of her sons, and more impersonal, !
more symbolic of Stanford than \
could be innumerable statues of J
Stanford's great.
The artistic or anatomical quali- j
fications of this particular sketch of j
a Hupa Indian warrior, native to I
Santa Clara valley, are beside the >
point. Do we or do we not want the j
Indian as a symbol?

Georgo Webster, '32
