THE CAPACITY of the Stanford |
side of the Oakland Auditorium will i
not be taxed Saturday night, by |
Stanford students at least, if the j
advance ticket sale is any indica- j
tion.
Only about CiOO scats had been
sold by the B.A.C. ticket office i
up to last night, according to
Jake Irwin. This is approxi
mately the same as for the first
Oakland game last year, but j
does not compare with the sec- i
oiifl, when 102,j students fol
lowed the team across the bay.
While tickets are still obtainable |
in the bay district, only 25 have j
been retained at the Farm ticket j
office. These will be on sale today ,
to students and general public.
ANOTHER FISTIC TREAT is of- !
fered tonight, when Stanford and [
Davis boxers will meet in the |
squared circle at the Pavilion.
Considering the interest shown
in the University championships j
last week, a large turnout may
be expected. The feature of the {
evening should be the long
awaited Smith - Palamounlain
scrap, postponed from last week j
because of the hitter's illness.
Coach Harry Maloney exterjds a j
particular invitation to the women, j
pointing out that there is no com- |
parison between the ordinary prize- }
fight and a Stanford boxing pro- |
gram, but that there IS plenty of [
action.
i
"TINY TOM" CORDRY made a >
hit during the last, invasion of the I
Southland by the Indian hoopsters. |
Here's what Max Plake, sports edi- j
tor of the Daily Trojans, had to say
about him:
"That little bundle of fight i
and energy was in my estima
tion the most elusive hoopinan I
that has been seen in collegiate
court cirles on the coast for
some time (and this DOESNT j
exclude Nemer and Elliott).
Well — you figure it out — if
Capps. a sure candidate for ail
coast honors, found difficulty in 1
keeping Cordry from shooting
his shots, then you i
can see that it is a plenty tough |
assignment to keep the lad un- |
der control."

THEY HAD to put the Southern j
California rooters on the other side j
of the Olympic Auditorium, because !
rival rooters gave the Trojan team I
the Bronx huzzah on several occa- I
sions when it left the floor at half |
time.
Particularly was this the case at
the first U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. meeting.
But, then, the*e was almost a rea
son—you will remember that it was j
on that occasion that the Barry i
hoopmen held on to the ball for 16 I
minutes straight with nary a biT of |
action.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA is J
looking forward to next basketball ,
season with great glee. Even "Ele- |
vator Sam" has been reported as j
saying that his "stalling" tactics j
won't be necessary.
The reason is a frosh team
that has won 13 straight games
this season, many of them by
lop-sided scores. Last week-end
they walloped the La Verne
Athletic Club, 38 to 23, and
Inglewood High School by a 37
to 15 score.
Ernie Holbrook, the "Nemer" of j
Ihe squad, accounted for 17 tallies i
in the first game and 10 in the sec- I
ond. —L.M.C.
