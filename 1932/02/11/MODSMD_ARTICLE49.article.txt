# STEVENS SHATTERS TWO-MAN BOBSLED RECORD TO GIVE YANKS FIFTH TRIUMPH
## 
### 
LAKE PLACID, N.Y., Feb. 10. (TP)
—A flash of almost unbelievable
speed gave Hubert Stevens, brawny,
iron-armed woodsman, the Olympic
two-man bobsled championship to
day, the United States its fifth
Olympic triumph, and 12,000 per
sons st rwn about the rocky sides
of Mt. Van Hoevenberg the thrill of
a lifetime.
Eclipsing everything that has ever
been done before in a bob run, Ste
vens twice flashed down through
the vertical curves and lightning
straightaways of the mile and a half
chute under two minutes, to make
up the 4.29 seconds he spotted to
Reto Capadrutt. yesterday and beat
the Swiss youngster for the title by
1.54 seconds.
There seemed little chance to de
feat Capadrutt unless an accident
stopped the mad surge of the young
Swiss sophomore from the Univer
sity of Zurich, when the twelve
drivers of eight nations took their

f sleds and brakemen to the top of
j the lofty mountain just after dawn
| to add the final two heats today to
the two raced yesterday.
And when Reto, second down the
slide today, found the track blazing
fast where yesterday Stevens, lead
j ing off, ploughed out the snow for
: the rest of the field, what little hope
! there had been died.
Down came the Swiss, his white,
i rope-steered sled glistening in the
bright winter light, hammering
through the curves, taking impos
] sible changes, riding high and wide
| and furious to zoom across the finish
line in 2 minutes 3.52 seconds,
I breaking the record Stevens set at
I 2:04.27 late yesterday.
! By the time Stevens took the
. track for his first run the field had
been distanced, although they all
i tried today the trick of heating the
j sled runners with blow torches, a
| trick that gave Hubert his 2:04.27
{ mark yesterday.

bright winter light, hammering
through the curves, taking impos

| and furious to zoom across the finish
line in 2 minutes 3.52 seconds,
I breaking the record Stevens set at
I 2:04.27 late yesterday.
! By the time Stevens took the
. track for his first run the field had
been distanced, although they all
i tried today the trick of heating the
j sled runners with blow torches, a
