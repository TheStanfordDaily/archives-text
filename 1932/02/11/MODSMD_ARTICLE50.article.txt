# FROSH HOOPSTERS MEET BEAR CUBS SATURDAY EVENING
## Second String Five Tangles With Galileo Cagers In Game Friday 
### Albert Guerard 
Stanford's scalping freshmen go in
for hunting in a big way this week
end when they tackle the Galileo
High Lions tomorrow in the Pa
vilion, and then trek up on Saturday
to Berkeley to ward off the even
more dangerous claws of the Cali
fornia Golden Bear.
Galileo, always a ringleader in
San Francisco prep basketball, will
be far from a set-up for Coach
Vance Fawcett's cagers on Friday.
The Lions are now leading the
A.A.A. league with four wins and
no losses, and seem destined to meet
Lowell, the team that gave both
Stanford and California fives such
bad beatings, for the league title.
Much as the Lion skin of Galileo
would look good in the Indian
trophy room, Fawcett will probably
save his best bets for Saturday
ilight, and trust his second-string
cagers with the task of turning back
the prep invasion.
A win over the Bears would be
hard to figure after comparing the
records of the two teams, but Faw
cett's cagei's have only to do two
things to register a win over their
rivals:
1. The Stanford defense must
check the Bear Cub dead-eye for
ward wall. Gordon Mallatratt, Joe
Butte, and Jim Savage at the guard
posts can be counted on to turn in
tight defensive games.
2. The Indian scoring threats,
Charley Coiner and Lory Rothert,
