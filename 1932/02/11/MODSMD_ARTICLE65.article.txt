# FEW BIDS REMAIN FOR TOYON DANCE
## 
### 
Only a limited number of bids
remain unsold for Toyon Club's
formal dance scheduled for tomor
row evening, according to Chairman
Beverly Robinson. Robinson was
emphatic in his statement last night
that no roughs at all would be ad
mitted to the affair at any hour.
Remaining invitations are avail
able at the A.S.S.U. office in the
Union at the depression price of
$3.50. Surprisingly unusual lighting
effects and decorations will prevail
in the novel atmosphere for Gordon
Hech's 10-piece campus orchestra.
