sity debaters, will argue the af
firmative side of the question, "Re

night in the Little Theatre at 8
o'clock,
According to Leland Chapin, de
bate coach, the recent government
action in forming the Reconstruc
tion Finance Corporation and the
ever-increasing economic functions
of the government in industry have
led to sharp controversy over
government control of industry. The
debate question, selected by Pi
Kappa Delta, national honorary de
bating fraternity, for discussion by
American colleges and universities,
hinges on this principle.
Trojans Lose Few
In the first dual debate to be held
with U.S.C. for several years, the
Trojans will be represented by two
experienced orators. In a com

Stanford debate manager, W. Lock

South who will speak in the Little
Theatre, i.s the captain of the de
bate squad, and has lost only one

taken part. White is a Bowen Cup
winner and is prominent in student
body affairs at Southern California.
