# TEMPLETON MAY BE AT WORK IN MARCH WITH TRACKSTERS
## 
### 
Dink Templeton. who has been j
j bedridden since the week-end of i
I the Stanford-U.S.C. football game, j
may be out coaching his track team j
some time toward the end of next
month. That is the opinion of Don
j Liebendorfer, Stanford publicity di
i rector, who has been seeing Tem
j pleton regularly since he has been !
I ill.
Although Bill Ellington has been
j in direct control of the tracksters, '
i Templeton is very much aware of '
j what is going on. Ellington confers j
! with Dink daily, and between them j
; they determine ihe workouts that ;
j will do the boys the most good j
without actually killing them off.
In view of the longest track sea- j
I son that has ever faced a Stanford j
1 track team, Templeton has allowed !
; the men to take things compara- j
tively easy to be in shape when the
I big July meets come around. Dink j
j knows that no runner can be in top
form for five months, and therefore i
I Stanford's performances in her j
j early meets are apt to be poorer j
| than might be expected.
Templeton has also been in direct !
j contact with many of the track
j men, as they take their troubles to j
j him and he tries to visualize them
! and iron them out. And Dink has I
i been eminently successful in the
difficult tasks of telling a hurdler
whom he can't see hurdle that he |
is dragging "his right leg, or sug
gesting that a shot-putter keep his j
head farther back.
