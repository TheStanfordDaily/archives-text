LOUISIANA
PERIQUE
is one of the fine tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS
Founder of the blend
Pcrique bears the same rela
tion to COLONEL ADAMS
mixture, that salt and pepper
do to food—it is a seasoning.
Perique is grown in St. James
Parrish, Louisiana—by the
native Creoles. It has never
been grown elsewhere suc
cessfully.
The tobacco is cut, then bound
into "Carrottes," and cured in
the native fashion—by fer
menting the leaf in its own
natural juices, until it turns
an Kbon Black hue.
Like all the tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS, our Per
ique is aged 4 and 5 years
before packing.
That's why COLONEL AD
AMS is mild and sweet and
doesn't bite your tongue like
unseasoned tobacco.
