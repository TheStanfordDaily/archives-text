Phil Smith over Ben Palamoun
tciin for the heavyweight champion
ship of the University by a technical
knockout in the third.
Stanford over California Aggies
by four bouts to three.
The.se were the features of the
boxing card put on for local fight
fans last night in the Pavilion. The
first two rounds of the feature
heavy bout were close, with Smith
consistently on the defense. The
winner took the aggressive in the
last period, however, and rushed
PaJamountain all over the ring.
Referee Percy Locey did well to
stop it when he did.
Johnson Wins
Fred Johnson looked great in a
one-minute K.O. over Charles Hoff
man in the middleweight class.
Hoffman last year won the Pacific
Coast championship in this weight,
which adds not a little to Johnson's
prestige. The knockout punch was
ihe same that put Ed Doleman un
der the table last week.
In the bantamweight division
Harold Shanklin staged a neat
comeback to win a decision over Ino
Cruz of the Davis squad. Cruz took
the first easily and gave the winner
a bad cut over the eye. Shanklin
found himself in the last two stan
zas and deserved to win.
Kelley (*cts Nod
The other Stanford win was a
close decision over Lindsey Jewett
in the welterweight class by Fire
man Jim Kelley. Every round was
close but Kelley had a shade. In
the featherweight department Mark
Kai-Kse put u pa game fight but
lost to Ronald Painter by a judge's
decision.
Clinton Jewell, Aggie lightweight,
won jn easy victory over Ben
Mathews when Coach Harry Ma
loney stopped the bout in the sec
ond. The third Davis win came
when Gilbert Borba won an easy
nod over Louis Ruschin, Indian
light-heavy. The victory was never
in doubt. Davis forfeited the heavy
weight bout, giving the match 6f
ficially to the Cardinals.
Four Prelims
In the four preliminary exhibition
fights no decisions were given. Cam
Jones, Stanford, and Holman Aus
tin, of the Aggies, went three rounds
of fairly even battling in the 145-
pound class. Hayden Henderson, of
Ihe Indians, looked good over Joe
Herzog al 139 pounds.
The 129-pound bout between
John Huston and Steve Au, of the
Aggies, looked to be a draw. The
first round of the 119-pound match
between Yu.ji Imai and Francis Ta
kahashi seemed a draw but the final
two went to Imai, the Indian ban
tam.
