# FROSH MUST DROP ERRATIC STYLE TO WIN ALAMEDA GAME
## 
### 
Faced by a formidable veteran
team from the Island city, the Stan
ford freshman baseball team crosses
bats with the Alameda High School
nine tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
on the local diamond for the opening
game of the season.
Although handicapped by few
! practices, the frosh outfit promises
j good material that should develop
! with time into a threatening ball
| team. Up to now, though, the infield
j has played ragged ball. To stave oil
| the threatening squad from Ala
j meda, the frosh need to settle down
I to a less erratic style of play,
j Coach Murray Cuddeback will
I probably start Fred Heringer, out
standing pitcher, on the mound. Her
j inger can hurl a well-trained ball
j and he stands high in batting cir
j cles. In reserve Cuddeback will hold
i A1 Semmelroth and Carl Eitnier.
i The position behind the plate is
! left in doubt as both catchers,
: Charlie Emcrick and Jack Hosmer,
i are suffering from finger injuries re
j suiting from practice yesterday,
j Henry Mudcl will hold down first
.base, while "Pepper" Boyd will com
: mand the keystone bag. Playing ofi
second will be Jim Woolley with
Jim Kurtz nearby taking care of
third. Jim Daily, Herb Griffin, and
' Pat Symonds will be in the outfield.
