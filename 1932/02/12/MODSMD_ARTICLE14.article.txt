# JAPAN FORCED TO PROJECT RIGHTS
## No Desire For China' Says Count In Interview 
### Rolph Malloch 
There is no idea in the mind of
Japan foi the conquest of China,
according to Count Ayski Kaba
yama, distinguished member of the
Japanese House of Peers, who
granted an exclusive interview to
the Stanford Daily yesterday after
noon in his .suite at the St. Francis
Hotel.
The Count and his traveling com
panion, Takashi Komatsu, frankly
discussed the Far Eastern crisis over
cups of tea —specially blended by
the hotel management to meet the
requirements of the fastidious mem
bers of Japan's Samurai class —
v.hile representatives of the city
press paced nervously up and down
the hall outside waiting for a chance
word with the great leader of Japa
nese thought.
Discusses Problems
Count Kabayama, who is small,
perpetually smiling, and quick in
ection and thought, speaks perfect
English. He came to America to dis
cuss the problems of the Orient
with American capitalists.
The Japanese statesman believes
that the Manchurian dispute and
the Shanghai affair are completely
separate, and that the Japanese peo
ple know that a»y plan to subject
China to their rule is absurd.
China's lack of homogenity, its com
plete lack of self-control, its great
population of bandits, would make
it impossible. The government of
Japan, said the Count, is aware of
this, and therefore cannot under
ytand the attitude of the American
newspapers.
Japan Disturbed
The travelers from Japan are
greatly disturbed by the present
agitation in the Orient. They spoke
of the necessity of taking action in
Manchuria because of the banditry.
The boycott of Japanese goods
and the treatment of Japanese na
tionals readied a point in Shanghai
that was unbearable, said the
Count. While the Chinese govern
ment promised to stop anti-Japa
nese activity, it was unable to do
so. Consequently it became neces
sary for Japan to use force in pro
tecting its rights.
