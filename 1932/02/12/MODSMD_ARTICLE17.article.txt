# SEQUOIA ADDS $50 TO RELIEF FUND
## 
### 
Sequoia—known far and wide as
the last stronghold of the primeval
Rough, came through last night as
the first men's student organization
to help the needy Rough.
At a special meeting called by
President Cyril Thomas after the
last pineapple fritter had been
downed, the Sequoia Club members
unanimously voted their cash and
moral support to the Students'
Emergency Committee, recently ap
pointed by Acting-President Robert
E. Swain to aid in meeting emer
gency conditions in the student ranks
by local action.
Not to be outdone by the "300".
who, in spite of the fact that none of
their members are involved, have
already promised to donate the pro
ceeds of their annual Carnival to the
Emergency Fund instead of buying
more furnishings for their gymna
sium—the Tribe at Sequoia without
a dissenting voice placed $50 of the
club funds at the disposal of the
Emergency Committee, with a prom
ise of more to come.
The promise was contingent on the
success of their annual Valentine
Dance to be held this evening in
Sequoia. If less than the $50 loss
expected is entailed, the difference
will be turned over to Registrar
John P. Mitchell, treasurer of the
fund, as will all the profits.
