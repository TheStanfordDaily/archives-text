# Templeton Wins Plea To Change Date Of I.C.4-A
## Card Coach Claims That Former Dates Would Conflict With Olympic Game Tryouts And Work Hardship On Men Who Enter Both Contests MONAHAN ANNOUNCES MEET FOR JULY 1-2 Change Permits Templeton To Enter Full Strength Teams; Increases Cards' Winning Chances 
### 
j INNING a battle that he lias been waging for three months, Dink
Templeton, Stanford track coach, was more than pleased yesterday
when William M. Monahan, graduate manager of the University of Cali
fornia, announced that the dates of the I.C.J-A. track meet would be
July I and 2. The meet, which will be held at Berkeley, was originally
scheduled for July S and !>. Templeton contested the latter dates on the
grounds that they would conflict with the final Olympic Games tryouts to
be held at Stanford on July 15 and l(i. II was Dink's contention that no

track man should be asked to com
pete in two such important meets
without more than a week's rest.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia sided with Templeton, but
Monahan although he too wished
to move the date forward, claimed
that the Fourth of July exodus
would deprive him of the assurance
of a large crowd. Since the Univer
sity of California is holding the
meet, it is forced to assume the
financial burden, which includes a
large guarantee to the 1.C.4-A.
Share Expenses
Although no official statement has
come from the office of A1 Masters,
Stanford graduate manager, it is
understood that Stanford and
Southern California agreed to share
part of the expenses with Cali
fornia. A. 1 - a result of this added
financial backing, Monahan has
changed the dates, and now all are
satisfied.
The 1.C.4-A.'s and Stagg's Inter
collegiate? at Chicago are annually
the most important and representa
tive of the national meets. This year,
because the 1.C.4-A.'s will serve as
a preliminary Olympic Games trial
and because they will be held in
California, where the Games will
come off later in the summer, the
meet promises to surpass its best
previous records. Monahan his al
ready received word that 250 East
ern and Middle Western athletes
will make the trip to the coast.
Victory for Dink
The change in the dates comes as
a distinct victory of Templeton. Dink
has claimed all along that he thought
the change would take place, and
now he will be able to enter Stan
ford's best in the 1.C.4-A.'s as well
as in the Olympic trial finals.
Among the Indian men who have
more than a chance to make the
United States Olympic team arc two
national champions from last year,
Ben Eastman and Bob Jones. East
man is the class of the nation's
middle-distance men, and Jones has
few superiors in the discus.
Outstanding Men
In addition, four shot-putters rank
among the nation's best. Nellie
Gray, George Grey, Here Laborde,
and John Lyman will have to be
considered, while Grey and Laborde
are als > threats in the discus. Miller
and DeGroot in the pole-vault, Les
Hables and perhaps Lombardi and
Giberson in the dashes, Captain Al
vin Habies in the quarter-mile, and
A1 Ray in the javelin are others who
may profit by the change in dates.
This change will make it possible
for Templeton to enter his full
strength in the 1.C.4-A. meet, and
will materially increase the Indians'
chances of winning. Eastman and
Les Habies in particular will be able
to run two or three races instead of
only one or perhaps none, as would
have been the case had the meet
been held on July 8 and 9.

be held at Stanford on July 15 and l(i. II was Dink's contention that no

track man should be asked to com
pete in two such important meets
without more than a week's rest.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia sided with Templeton, but
Monahan although he too wished
to move the date forward, claimed
that the Fourth of July exodus
would deprive him of the assurance
of a large crowd. Since the Univer
sity of California is holding the
meet, it is forced to assume the
financial burden, which includes a
large guarantee to the 1.C.4-A.
Share Expenses
Although no official statement has
come from the office of A1 Masters,
Stanford graduate manager, it is
understood that Stanford and
Southern California agreed to share
part of the expenses with Cali
fornia. A. 1 - a result of this added
financial backing, Monahan has
changed the dates, and now all are
satisfied.
The 1.C.4-A.'s and Stagg's Inter
collegiate? at Chicago are annually
the most important and representa
tive of the national meets. This year,
because the 1.C.4-A.'s will serve as
a preliminary Olympic Games trial
and because they will be held in
California, where the Games will
come off later in the summer, the
meet promises to surpass its best
previous records. Monahan his al
ready received word that 250 East
ern and Middle Western athletes
will make the trip to the coast.
Victory for Dink
The change in the dates comes as
a distinct victory of Templeton. Dink
has claimed all along that he thought
the change would take place, and
now he will be able to enter Stan
ford's best in the 1.C.4-A.'s as well
as in the Olympic trial finals.
Among the Indian men who have
more than a chance to make the
United States Olympic team arc two
national champions from last year,
Ben Eastman and Bob Jones. East
man is the class of the nation's
middle-distance men, and Jones has
few superiors in the discus.
Outstanding Men
In addition, four shot-putters rank
among the nation's best. Nellie
Gray, George Grey, Here Laborde,
and John Lyman will have to be
considered, while Grey and Laborde
are als > threats in the discus. Miller
and DeGroot in the pole-vault, Les
Hables and perhaps Lombardi and
Giberson in the dashes, Captain Al
vin Habies in the quarter-mile, and
A1 Ray in the javelin are others who
may profit by the change in dates.
This change will make it possible
for Templeton to enter his full
strength in the 1.C.4-A. meet, and
will materially increase the Indians'
chances of winning. Eastman and
Les Habies in particular will be able
to run two or three races instead of
only one or perhaps none, as would
have been the case had the meet
been held on July 8 and 9.

Templeton, Stanford track coach, was more than pleased yesterday
when William M. Monahan, graduate manager of the University of Cali
fornia, announced that the dates of the I.C.J-A. track meet would be
July I and 2. The meet, which will be held at Berkeley, was originally
scheduled for July S and !>. Templeton contested the latter dates on the
grounds that they would conflict with the final Olympic Games tryouts to
be held at Stanford on July 15 and l(i. II was Dink's contention that no
