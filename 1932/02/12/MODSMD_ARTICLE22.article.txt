# HANG YOUR HEADS, MEN

### 
Sequoia Club is Hie first men's organization which lias
responded to the appeal for funds Jjy the Students' Emer
gency Fund Committee, appointed by Acting-President
Swain to help students in need of financial aid.
The club has offered to donate the profits of its dance
tonight. However, as the sale of bids indicates that the
dance committee might suffer a loss, the organization will
give .">() dollars to the Committee, provided the loss on
the dance does not equal that amount.
Although there are practically no women in need of as
sistance, the women have been the first to offer funds to
the Committee. The faculty women are holding a bridge
lea on February 1!', the proceeds of which will go into the
fund and the W.A.A. has offered to turn over the money
received from the Carnival on March f to the aid of needy
students.
Outside of Sequoia Club, no other men's organization
has volunteered assistance. It is the men, not the women,
on this campus who are in need of funds and it is up to the
men to do Iheir share.
