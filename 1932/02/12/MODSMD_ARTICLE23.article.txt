# ABOLISH FRATERNITIES!
## 
### 
In its obvious attempts to be humorous, the latest issue j
of Collcijc Humor has been particularly successful through
the inclusion of an article by Philip Wylie entitled "Abolish
Fraternities."
The humor which distinguishes it from the "joke" sec-1
lion of the magazine is enhanced by the unniistakeably se
rious intentions of Mr. Wylie in laying all the ills in the j
make-up of presenf-dav American society on the doorstep
of the "frat."
Mr. Wylie begins his article by taking the roof off a
typical fraternity house, Delta Hlio Camilla, and looking
inside "from the cellar where the boys run a still to the j
rooms upstairs where young lust steals on dark and
drunken Saturday evenings."
Me then lakes .Jack, the typical freshman inherently'
pure, guileless, ambitious. Ile follows .lack through his four
years of fraternity life, watching him emerge an utterly I
disreputable rake-hell. One paragraph of the story will il
lustrate the movie-type collegian whom Mr. Wylie seems
to know thoroughly.
"I lis drinking is a joke. To anyone who understands se- j
rious drinking and who practices it (evidently Mr. Wylie
himself) the frafcrnilx standards would be grotesque. Yet
the college lad fancies himself something of an Fpicure and
inan-about-town when he sends lo the drugstore for toasted ,
cheese sandwiches and mixes up a swill of gin and 11011-
alcoholic cremr <lc mrnlhr and lemons and hands if to a
neurotic and handsome young lady who is come fresh from
reading a debarred book on thcÂ«ui of love."
Ibis sort of filing can be no more than just a laugh to
the average student. Nevertheless, if is a pity that niaga- !
zincs exist which run such tripe without labeling if "humor"
to the benefit of the outsider who has never had the op
portunity lo view college life first hand.
