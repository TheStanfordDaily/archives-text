## "GUM"-A LETTER TO A STANFORD SORORITY 
### 
About five years ago or so, the I
flapper as the ideal of American j
womanhood began to disappear. Her :
natural stupidity purposely in
creased to supply half of the "dumb |
but beautiful" combination and I
more than ample makeup was applied
in an attempt to fullill the other 1
half of that immutable command
ment. She was the type that went
ga-ga over everything. But she has
or is passing. Her place is being |
token by tlie "sophisticated lady"— \
so-calied. The change has been !
symbolized on the screen in the |
move from Bow to Dietrich.
But in this new age, there arc still j
certain hangovers—and one of them J
is gum-chewing. One can see a [
woman dressed in all the brown and j
black—in all the flowing lines—thai 1
are supposed to indicate the "lady," {
but when the old jaws start mov- j
ing up and down, the brand is there
—the "flapper in modern dress." !
There is a sorority on this campus I
whose gum-chewers are just about j
driving the house to the proverbial !
wall. In fact many claim that if I
these girls would only park their j
gum behind the kitchen door before !
they ventured forth to the library |
or to jollyups, the house would wit
ness a boom that would make Wall I
Street of 1928 seem like a very j
gentle blast, indeed.
It is peculiar that from a distance !
—say about 100 yards—the girls j

look sophisticated (in the popular
tense); but as soon as one gets
within close range, one's attention
is focused on but one thing—the
hectic oscillation of their jaws. We
have sat in the library with the
same fascination with which one
might study a giant boa swallow a
sheep whole—and wonder how
these seemingly fragile Co-eds could
masticate so strenuously and so
continuously.
Finally, I came to the conclusion
that they must chew gum in their
sleep for by no other means could
they keep in condition for the all
day grind. Finally, a morbid inter
est in the subject developed. 1 be
gan to wonder if they ever changed
pieces. At first, I thought absolutely
not because that would mean wast
ing a few precious motions while
the change was being made. But
then, I reasoned that probably their
great proficiency made it possible
for them to dicharge the old and
reload with the new all in one
motion. *
Gum has its value. It takes that
morning-after-the-night-before taste
out of one's mouth. But it doesn't
seem possible that these girls go
booming in a big way every night
in the week. Of course, the poor
things may have bought heavily in
Wrigley and Beechnut; it may be
that these firms are paying divi
dends in trade. It may not be, too.
