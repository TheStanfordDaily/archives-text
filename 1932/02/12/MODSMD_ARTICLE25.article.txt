STRICTLY DISHONORABLE — At!
the California in Ma.vfield
A really amusing picture for a
change. And an honest Southern
accent accompanied by Sidney Fox, ;
a newcomer, and a tricky little
heroine. Another success without a
theme song—long may they con
tinue!
Paul Lukas is as suave as ever in
his role of Opera Star—a philan
derer among women—but he falls
in love, and that settles his fate. The
action takes place in one evening,
night, and morning—a short peiiod
crammed full of happenings.
Lewis Stone gives one of the best
performances we have seen for a
long while—the speak-easy judge,
with a heart of gold, and brittle
exterior. Don't miss this show!

GREEN HELL—By Julian Duguid.
The Century Company. New York,
London. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Officially the account of a Boli
vian government expedition to re
port on the agricultural possibilities
of the eastern forest plain of the
country, this book seems like a

novel. Character and action, rather
than descriptions of the country, are !
stressed, and a delightful sense of '
humor on the part of the author i
makes the tone very different from I
that of the usual travel book.
The vividness and style are ex- !
traordinarily good for a first book, I
which the author confesses this to J
be. Told in the first person, this i
four months' journey may by mule!
is replete with savage Indians, hun- |
ger, thirst, tropic storms, and in- j
sects. Chiefly insects. By a perfectly
painless process the reader gains a i
good deal of knowledge about the I
jungle, the history of Bolivia, the
customs of the people, and the char
acter of the four chief members of j
the expedition. Displaying a pleas- :
ing variety, these four are a Bolivian
Consul-General, a British cinema -
tographer who made a movie of
(he expedition, the author, also :
British, and a Russian who made his j
living by shooting jaguars and sell- j
ing the skins.
The only thing I can find to ob- !
ject to is the author's remark that |
Green Hell (the forest) is a woman ;
because of her cold cruelty. Let us j
hope the feminists will get hold of
him. —F.J.

change. And an honest Southern
accent accompanied by Sidney Fox, ;
a newcomer, and a tricky little
heroine. Another success without a
theme song—long may they con
tinue!
Paul Lukas is as suave as ever in
his role of Opera Star—a philan
derer among women—but he falls
in love, and that settles his fate. The
action takes place in one evening,
night, and morning—a short peiiod
crammed full of happenings.
Lewis Stone gives one of the best
performances we have seen for a
long while—the speak-easy judge,
with a heart of gold, and brittle
exterior. Don't miss this show!

GREEN HELL—By Julian Duguid.
The Century Company. New York,
London. 1931. (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
Officially the account of a Boli
vian government expedition to re
port on the agricultural possibilities
of the eastern forest plain of the
country, this book seems like a

novel. Character and action, rather
than descriptions of the country, are !
stressed, and a delightful sense of '
humor on the part of the author i
makes the tone very different from I
that of the usual travel book.
The vividness and style are ex- !
traordinarily good for a first book, I
which the author confesses this to J
be. Told in the first person, this i
four months' journey may by mule!
is replete with savage Indians, hun- |
ger, thirst, tropic storms, and in- j
sects. Chiefly insects. By a perfectly
painless process the reader gains a i
good deal of knowledge about the I
jungle, the history of Bolivia, the
customs of the people, and the char
acter of the four chief members of j
the expedition. Displaying a pleas- :
ing variety, these four are a Bolivian
Consul-General, a British cinema -
tographer who made a movie of
(he expedition, the author, also :
British, and a Russian who made his j
living by shooting jaguars and sell- j
ing the skins.
The only thing I can find to ob- !
ject to is the author's remark that |
Green Hell (the forest) is a woman ;
because of her cold cruelty. Let us j
hope the feminists will get hold of
him. —F.J.
STRICTLY DISHONORABLE — At!
the California in Ma.vfield
A really amusing picture for a
change. And an honest Southern
accent accompanied by Sidney Fox, ;
a newcomer, and a tricky little
heroine. Another success without a
theme song—long may they con
tinue!
