J The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial in today's issue,;
I namely, '"Keep the Bird in Hand," is
! very timely, but why stop there? ,
| Why not expand the idea of the
| editorial to include ihe many evi- j
I dences of ungentlemanly conduct of I
j which the students have been guilty ;
'all to frequently. I need only refer
jto the unsportsmanlike attitude of !
! the students at recent basketball
j games.
We all revere Dr. Jordan's mem- \
j cry and we all remember what he
j aid to make this University what j
: it is. I wonder how many of the
! present students realize that the
j lack of sportsmanship so prevalent j
! nowadays would have resulted in ;
j the abolition of all athletic contests j
I with ofT-campus teams in the days '
j when Dr. Jordan was president of
i the University.
j Stanford men are supposed to be
I or at least act like gentlemen wher
j ever they may be.
