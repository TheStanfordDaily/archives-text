Amo, amas, amat, amamus, ama
tis, amant. The party of the first
and all-important part would like
for you to consider yourself his
Valentine. This in no way represents
an entangling alliance.
From E. Boyles (logical, for once)
I would consider it a deep
personal tribute if you would be
my Valentine!
