Captain Gordan, coach of the
Redshivt riders, complains that it

! has been the worst season for prac
tice in several years. All last season
there were only two days of prac
| tice missed because of rain, while
i this year the team has been lueky
to get in a dozen real scrimmages
since December.
j Although final arrangements for
i the Utah game have not been en
tirely completed, it is quite probable
; that the Utah outfit will accept the
I dates proposed by Stanford. The
Utes, too, have been considerably
handicapped by lack of practice, but
they should furnish the Cards with
