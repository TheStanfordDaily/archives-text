ANYTHING OR NOTHING can
happen at the Oakland auditorium
tomorrow night.
Meaning that the Indian five, de
spite all injuries and a seven-game
Itisii i;» streak, may give the Bears
a whale of a battle —or California
may go quietly ahead and trounce
the Stanford outfit, as seems to be
expected.
Coach John Bunn has organ
ized an entirely new combina
tion this week, a combination
that looked in practice last
night as if it might go places.
With Meade and Cordry at for
wards, Packard at center, and
Edelen and Cosgrove at guards,
the first string cleaned up on the
Grays.
The switch of Cosgrove from
forward to guard seems to be
very much of a success. La-
Cornhe worked well at a guard
post against U.S.C. last Friday
before lie received the injury
that put him out for the season,
and bis former Menlo teammate
is fitting in successfully at the
same position.
Against the Grays this newest
combination had plenty of shots at
the basket last night, although not
a high enough percentage was
tanked to satisfy Bunn. At times the
team looked very times
very ordinary.
In short, it looked as if it could
do anything or nothing.
REGARDLESS OF the winner or
the score, look for the Bunn crew
to put up a battle tomorrow night.
"We're not saying anything," re
marked Coach John last night.
"We're just working hard."
The California Bear, witli a slim
chance still remaining to retain the
southern division title, can be ex
pected to be a tough customer, but
the Stanford Indian will also be a
very stubborn fellow.
TWENTY-TWO is very different
from 43. Forty-three deaths they
charged to football last fall, and
sensational newspapers played up
the alleged fact lor all it was worth.
Editorial columns were filled with
comment about the dangers of the
sport, and the general public was
duly shocked.
Yet a careful check-up by Field
ing Yost, athletic director at the
University of Michigan, revealed
that only 22, and not 43 deatrs, ac- |
tually resulted from football. Of this
number only seven were charged |
to the college game, the remainder |
to high-school and unorganized play, j
By no means do we mean to say i
that the life of a college player is j
worth more than that of a high- j
school youth, but this survey does
lelieve the college game of an un
fair responsibility ihat has been
charged to it, and places the burden
of responsibility where it belongs.
"Clipper" Smith of Santa
Clara declared early last season
that no high-school youth under !
15 should be allowed to play
football, and that greater care
should be taken by high schools
to stop preventable injuries.
"Pop" Warner's suggestion
that football equipment be de
signed to protect the wearer
rather than inflict injury on the
opponent is also backed by this
survey.
One of Yost's most important
conclusions concerned this
point: "Fatal injuries occur prin
cipally as the result of players
being struck on the neck, head,
or abdomen by hard fibre of
thigh guards."
Changes in equipment and greater I
care in the training and medical j
supervision of high-school teams |
would go a long way to take the |
danger out of football. —L.M.C. I
