# CAGEMEN MEET U. G. TOMORROW
## Bears Favored In Second Game Of Series 
### Dick Rodda 
A crippled but fighting "Stanford
basketball squad will go over to the
Oakland auditorium tomorrow night
| to meet the California Bears in the
second game of the annual big se
| ries. The Indians, having lost their
last seven games, will be desperate
ly battling against odds to close an
; unsuccessful 1932 cage season in
| glory by taking at least one of the
; remaining two games with the
j Bears.
Coach John Bunn gave his outfit
j a final survey last night to find that
| he had just one regular to start who
| has been physically capable of ap
pearing in every game this season.
That regular is Dave Packard, who
will open at center. Bunn will choose
I two forwards from a trio of Cordry,
| Palmer, and Meade and start Edelen
| and Cosgrove in the guard positions.
LaCombc Injured
j With Frenchy LaCompe, sensa
: tional forward, out with a cracked
vertebra, the Card scoring depart-
I ment. will be seriously handicapped,
j "Tiny Tom" Cordry will be counted
upon to fill LaCombe's shoes, and
not having played against the Bears
yet this year, the diminutive forward
may break loose as he did a year
I ago in the Oakland auditorium.
Cordry's absence was keenly felt
jin the first California game here
three weeks ago as LaCombe was
j completely bottled up by Price's
I guards. Cordry's superior floorwork
! gives him an advantage and no op
; posing squad has as yet been able
i to keep him under control.
Nogard May Play
| Al Nogard, who is still suffering
I from a sprained ankle, was out again
last nighL and took part in the work
out. While his leg is not perfectly
healed it is expected that he will be
in shape by Saturday to enter the
fray and according to Bunn he may
start in place of either Edelen or
Cosgrove. Bunn also has Phil Baker
to use as a guard substitute. The
forward reserves are Lambert and
Glasgow. Hancock and Doub will
be ready to replace Packard at cen
ter, but just at present Bunn is more
interested in controlling the tip-off
which is usually accomplished when
the sophomore giant is in the pivot
position.
Bunn sent the boys through a short
scrimage last night and will conclude
practice tonight, drilling the men in
free throws and fundamentals.
Bears' Last Chance
With everything to lose, Nibs
Price's Bears will be making a "last
stand" for the conference title when
they ftieet the Indians in the two re
maining encounters. Unless the
Bears defeat Stanford twice U.C.
L.A. is at the same time trouncing
the leading U.S.C. Trojans in one of
the two games yet to be played in
the south, the Trojans will win the
southern division Li tie. The Boars,
realizing that the Bruins have upset
the Trojans once already and that
there is nothing to stop them from
repeating, will obviously be doing
everything possible to prevent the
Indians from wrecking their chances.
Price has a treacherous five well
equipped with reserves, to throw
against the Cards. No one man is
expected to play the full game. Joe
Kintana, who was chiefly responsible
for the Bear 25 to 19 victory here,
will open at forward with Larry Sei
fert as his teammate. Read will start
at center and Ohashi and Captain
Vendt will be the guards.

Nogard May Play
| Al Nogard, who is still suffering
I from a sprained ankle, was out again
last nighL and took part in the work
out. While his leg is not perfectly
healed it is expected that he will be
in shape by Saturday to enter the
fray and according to Bunn he may
start in place of either Edelen or
Cosgrove. Bunn also has Phil Baker
to use as a guard substitute. The
forward reserves are Lambert and
Glasgow. Hancock and Doub will
be ready to replace Packard at cen
ter, but just at present Bunn is more
interested in controlling the tip-off
which is usually accomplished when
the sophomore giant is in the pivot
position.
Bunn sent the boys through a short
scrimage last night and will conclude
practice tonight, drilling the men in
free throws and fundamentals.
Bears' Last Chance
With everything to lose, Nibs
Price's Bears will be making a "last
stand" for the conference title when
they ftieet the Indians in the two re
maining encounters. Unless the
Bears defeat Stanford twice U.C.
L.A. is at the same time trouncing
the leading U.S.C. Trojans in one of
the two games yet to be played in
the south, the Trojans will win the
southern division Li tie. The Boars,
realizing that the Bruins have upset
the Trojans once already and that
there is nothing to stop them from
repeating, will obviously be doing
everything possible to prevent the
Indians from wrecking their chances.
Price has a treacherous five well
equipped with reserves, to throw
against the Cards. No one man is
expected to play the full game. Joe
Kintana, who was chiefly responsible
for the Bear 25 to 19 victory here,
will open at forward with Larry Sei
fert as his teammate. Read will start
at center and Ohashi and Captain
Vendt will be the guards.
A crippled but fighting "Stanford
basketball squad will go over to the

j Bears.
Coach John Bunn gave his outfit
j a final survey last night to find that
