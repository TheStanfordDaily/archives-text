# CAGEMEN MEET U. G. TOMORROW
## Bears Favored In Second Game Of Series 
### Dick Rodda 
A crippled but fighting "Stanford
basketball squad will go over to the
Oakland auditorium tomorrow night
| to meet the California Bears in the
second game of the annual big se
| ries. The Indians, having lost their
last seven games, will be desperate
ly battling against odds to close an
; unsuccessful 1932 cage season in
| glory by taking at least one of the
; remaining two games with the
j Bears.
Coach John Bunn gave his outfit
j a final survey last night to find that
| he had just one regular to start who
| has been physically capable of ap
pearing in every game this season.
That regular is Dave Packard, who
will open at center. Bunn will choose
I two forwards from a trio of Cordry,
| Palmer, and Meade and start Edelen
| and Cosgrove in the guard positions.
LaCombc Injured
j With Frenchy LaCompe, sensa
: tional forward, out with a cracked
vertebra, the Card scoring depart-
I ment. will be seriously handicapped,
j "Tiny Tom" Cordry will be counted
upon to fill LaCombe's shoes, and
not having played against the Bears
yet this year, the diminutive forward
may break loose as he did a year
I ago in the Oakland auditorium.
Cordry's absence was keenly felt
jin the first California game here
three weeks ago as LaCombe was
j completely bottled up by Price's
I guards. Cordry's superior floorwork
! gives him an advantage and no op
; posing squad has as yet been able
i to keep him under control.
Nogard May Play
| Al Nogard, who is still suffering
I from a sprained ankle, was out again
