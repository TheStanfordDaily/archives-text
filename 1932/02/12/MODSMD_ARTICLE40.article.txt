# Indian Nine vs. Broncs In Conference Opener
## CADDEL STARTING IN BOX TOMORROW, MASSEY TO CATCH Stanford Out To Keep Last Year's Championship In Face Of Odds 
### Bob Wade 
Giving the fans their first real
peek at the latest Wolter-coached
outfit, the Stanford varsity baseball
team will officially open the con
ference season against the Santa
Clara Broncos tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 o'clock when Ernie Caddel
tosses the first ball over the plate
to Bob Massey.
With a pre-conference record of
two games won arid only one lost,
the Indians enter on the defense of
their honors, won last year, at least
an. even bet to come out on top for
the second consecutive season.
Goodell at First
At first base Wolter will have
Fred Goodell, who put up a nice
game against the Kenealy Seals
Wednesday, and who bids fair to
more than fill the shoes left vacant
by Spud Hardy. On second will be
Vinee Philippi, veteran from last
year's outfit, who showed signs of
his old hitting power in the contest
against the Big Leaguers.
At third base the Indians present
: reformed golfer, in the person of
Jerry Trautman, who came up with
three nice stops of what looked to
(he Seals themselves like sure sin
gles Wednesday. The youngster
made quite a hit with the paid-to
play gentlemen, but it remains to
be seen how he will take to con
ference competition.
The shortstop job will be taken
care of by Bert Delmas, captain of
the 1933 freshman team and a let
terman from last year. Delmas was
one of the two Indian batters who
managed to boost their marks over
.400 last year.
Stanford's outfield is made up of
a pair of veterans in Rintala and
Campbell, and a flashy sophomore
in little "Lefty" Goldmann. Rintala
led the Card swatters last year with
a .420 mark.
Broncs Strong Outfit
Down at Santa Clara Coach Wal
ter "'The Great"' Mails has been
building up an outfit that he con
tends is a good deal stronger than
the one which dropped three games
in a row to the Indians last yeax\
On first base, the Broncs have a
capable letterman in Les "Lefty"
Powers. The southpaw's fielding
would be a joy to any coach, while
at bat he is always dangerous.
At second the visitors have "Gol
die" Goldsong, who is replacing last
season's captain, "Swede" Harper,
and on third is another newcomer,
"Wee" Weisinger, who is filling in
for last year's letterman, Stuart, who
has been laid off by the doctors.
The short patch will be handled
by Captain Steve Murray, with
'"Diamond Joe" Paglia in left field,
Schneer in center, and A1 Dowd in
right.
Behind the plate Mails will start
Joe Morcy, who was laid up after
the first pair of games last year, a
veteran who should bolster up the
Santa Clara batteries considerably.
Mails has six pitchers to choose
from, more than he has seen for a
number of years, and the most like
ly starter among them is Larry
Eurke, with Manfredi and Thomas
in reserve.
