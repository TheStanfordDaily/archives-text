Quad pictures of both the
varsity and freshman track ;
squads will be taken Wednes
day afternoon at 4:30 o'clock on
the old ova!. Manager Ernie
Hatch urges all track men to
get clean suits by that time.
Deciding to allow his tracksters
another week in which to acquire
additional energy, Coach Bill El
lington called off this afternoon's j
practice meet. The boys will have
a chance to settle their various ac
cumulated rivalries next Friday,
when the annual interclass meet and
Irish marathon will be held.
Coach Ellington will preside over
time trials for several of the fresh
man hopefuls this afternoon, in an
attempt to learn at least a little 1
something about the yearling team
that will meet the San Francisco
All-Stars on February 27. Ellington
is especially anxious to see what
Russ Munroe can do in the low
hurdles, and also will probably try
out his numerous but inexperienced
middle-distance men.
Captain Alvin Hables, who was in
the hospital for two weeks with an
unknown ailment, finally was told I
that he had been suffering from an
attack of pneumonia. Hables is now j

' on a leave of absence, and it is not
; known whether or not he will be in
shape to run this year.
The loss of Hables, in addition to
depriving the team of its captain,
j would leave a large gap in the relay
team and the 440. Les Hables, who
quite some quarter-miler himself,
will be concentrating on the sprints
this year, and Ben Eastman will be
, working on the 880 as well as the
quarter. So the team is hopefully
singing, "Alvin Come Back to Me."
The interclass meet should be one
of the best practice affairs ever seen
aiound the University. Anyone en
rolled in Stanford will be eligible
to compete, and this will allow cer
tain ambitious and optimistic former
Indian stars to try and surpass the
best of the 1932 varsity and fresh
man squads.
Just in case the appearance of a
bunch of old men who have not
donned spiked shoes for a couple of
years is not funny enough, a series
of novelty events will be held in
connection with the interclass meet.
Three-legged and sack races will
probably be run off, and the man-
I killing steeplechase will as usual
draw a large field of combined two
, milers, hurdlers, and acrobats.
