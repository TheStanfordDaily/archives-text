# ONLY ONE STANFORD FENCER WILL ENTER NOVICE SABER MEET
## 
### 
Bay Division fencers received i
good news yesterday afternoon, '
when it was learned that only one
Stanford fencer, Fred Pearman,
enter the individual novice
saber championships to be held to
night at Harmon Gym in Berkeley.
The Indian foilsmen and saberists
have walked away with the honors j
in both the team meets held to date, I
and have qualified three out of the !
six men who will represent the Bay
Division in the Pacific Coast indi- ,
vidual finals.
In spite of having no teammates to I

cheer him on, Pearman is consider
able of a threat on his own hook.
Although Pearman prefers a foil to
a saber, his undoubted ability with
the former weapon should give him
a good chance against the other
novice saber wielders of the penin
sula.
