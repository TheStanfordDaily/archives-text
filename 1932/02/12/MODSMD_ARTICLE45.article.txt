# CARD TANKMEN MEET OLYMPIC TEAM TONIGHT
## Varsity Swimmers Will Contest Six Events In First Meet 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
Varsity tankmen will have their
first opportunity this season to show
the campus what they can do when
they meet the Olympic Club swim
mers in San Francisco tonight at 8
o'clock. A series of six compromise
events will be contested, three cho
sen by the Clubmen, and three by
the local splashers.
Stanford's choices were the 400-
ycrd relay, and the 100- and 200-
yard free-style, the Winged O pick
ing the 100-yard breaststroke, 100-
yard backstroke, and diving as their
main point-catchers. Capping the
program, a fast water polo game
will find two unusually strong
teams pitted against each other.
Lineup Announced
Assistant Coach Norton Thornton
announced the lineup yesterday for
every event, with indecision hang
| ing only over two positions on the
polo team. Tuppy Gardner, John
McKelvy, Ted Wiget, and Frank
Booth will handle the relay, Gard
! ner and JN'ieKelvey holding down
I the only two jobs for the Cardinals
j in the 100. The Indians aren't wor
j ried about either of these events a
i great deal, although Frank Montali
i and Ralph Gilman, 15-year-okl
j wonder, should put up a pretty good
fight in the century.
Gilman and Frank Mooney will
; enter the 220 for the Club, facing
| the ace combination of Wiget and
j Austin Clapp. The Northerners
J haven't much of a chance in this
i distance. The 100-yard breaststroke
{ however, is pretty likely to go to
| Arthur Hargraves, the Club's Pa
j cific Association champion.

A blow to the Indians in the div
j ing branch came with the announce
j ment that Herb Marsh, number one
springboard artist, will be out of
competition due to sickness. The
Club likewise loses its best diver, in
the person of Ed Throndson, Stan
-1 ford's 1930 captain, who is in the
hospital. This balances the casual
ties, but assures no victory in this
• event for the Cards. Bill Campbell
, and Bob Wardvvell will hold up this
end of the competition against Cliff
Sanford and Guerton Carrol of the
Club.
This leaves only the 100-yard
breaststroke, which is bound to turn
into quite a race, Bob Clark and
Larry Harris trying to lead Binner
and Burns, last year's Indian water
polo captain, to the finish line.
Former Stanford Men
Four former Stanford men —Col-
lette, Burns, DeSilva, and Fickert,
will line up, along with 1928 Olym
pic Games Captain George Mitchell
and 1-324 and 1928 Games Team
Member George Schroth, to stop the
! Cardinal water polo combination if
; they can. Thornton will start Wiget
at sprint, Booth and Clapp at for
ward, Woods at center back, Kink
eail and either Harris or Murrieta at
guard, and Knapp or Linton at goal.

Stanford's choices were the 400-
ycrd relay, and the 100- and 200-
yard free-style, the Winged O pick
ing the 100-yard breaststroke, 100-
yard backstroke, and diving as their
main point-catchers. Capping the
program, a fast water polo game
will find two unusually strong
teams pitted against each other.
Lineup Announced
Assistant Coach Norton Thornton
announced the lineup yesterday for
every event, with indecision hang
| ing only over two positions on the
polo team. Tuppy Gardner, John
McKelvy, Ted Wiget, and Frank
Booth will handle the relay, Gard
! ner and JN'ieKelvey holding down
I the only two jobs for the Cardinals
j in the 100. The Indians aren't wor
j ried about either of these events a
i great deal, although Frank Montali
i and Ralph Gilman, 15-year-okl
j wonder, should put up a pretty good
fight in the century.
Gilman and Frank Mooney will
; enter the 220 for the Club, facing
| the ace combination of Wiget and
j Austin Clapp. The Northerners
J haven't much of a chance in this
i distance. The 100-yard breaststroke
{ however, is pretty likely to go to
| Arthur Hargraves, the Club's Pa
j cific Association champion.
Card Divers 111
A blow to the Indians in the div
j ing branch came with the announce
j ment that Herb Marsh, number one
springboard artist, will be out of
competition due to sickness. The
Club likewise loses its best diver, in
the person of Ed Throndson, Stan
-1 ford's 1930 captain, who is in the
hospital. This balances the casual
ties, but assures no victory in this
• event for the Cards. Bill Campbell
, and Bob Wardvvell will hold up this
end of the competition against Cliff
Sanford and Guerton Carrol of the
Club.
This leaves only the 100-yard
breaststroke, which is bound to turn
into quite a race, Bob Clark and
Larry Harris trying to lead Binner
and Burns, last year's Indian water
polo captain, to the finish line.
Former Stanford Men
Four former Stanford men —Col-
lette, Burns, DeSilva, and Fickert,
will line up, along with 1928 Olym
pic Games Captain George Mitchell
and 1-324 and 1928 Games Team
Member George Schroth, to stop the
! Cardinal water polo combination if
; they can. Thornton will start Wiget
at sprint, Booth and Clapp at for
ward, Woods at center back, Kink
eail and either Harris or Murrieta at
guard, and Knapp or Linton at goal.
Varsity tankmen will have their
first opportunity this season to show
the campus what they can do when
they meet the Olympic Club swim
mers in San Francisco tonight at 8
o'clock. A series of six compromise
events will be contested, three cho
sen by the Clubmen, and three by
the local splashers.
