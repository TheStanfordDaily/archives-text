# CAL YEARLINGS PICKED TO WIN IN CAGE GAME
## Farm Frosh Have Lost 3 Out Of 9 Games; Play Galileo Tonight 
### Albert Guerard 
Two to one underdogs, with a
record of 3 v/ins in 11 games, and
with every edge in height, material,
and experience belonging to the op
position, the Stanford freshmen take
the floor of the Oakland Auditorium
at 6:30 tomorrow night against the
California Bear Cups.
The Indians realize their only
hope of winning lies in matching
speed with speed, and beating their
rivals at their own game. Tonight a
second-string freshman five faces
Galileo High in the Pavilion. The
game will begin at 7:30 o'clock.
Cal Won First
California won the first game of
the annual Little Big Series, 47-33,
in spite of a fine, fast-breaking of
fense presented by the Indians.
Meeks, Morgan, and Bauer scored
34 points on set-up shots, while
Lory Rothert, Gordon Mallatratt,
and Frank Cox tallied 25 for Stan
ford.
were scored in the first meeting of
were scored in the first meetitng of
the two teams, and with Stanford
out to score quickly and early in
the game, tomorrow night's contest
should be even faster. Many fans
believe that the first California
freshman game was the best game
played in the Stanford Pavilion this
year. Certainly it far outscored the
varsity game for good shooting,
passing, and clean, fast play.
Butte at Center
Saturday night the Indians will
line up as follows: Crowe, center;
C. Coiner and Rothert, forwards;
Mallatratt and Butte, guards. Butte
will work at center on the tip-off
and then fall back to his guard post,
where he is so valuable in getting
the ball off the backboard, and for
breaking up the opposing team's
plays. Coiner gets the nod over Cox
at one forward, largely due to his
good shooting eye at middle range.
Galileo's Lions should win over
the frosh Friday night, if for no
other reason than that Coach Vance
Fawcett will save his best men for
the all-important clash on Saturday
night. Fage, Henry Coiner, Sales,
Mack, and Butts will open the game
against Galileo, and it is not un
likely Ihat some member of this
five will get a chance to play in the
Oakland Auditorium.

against Galileo, and it is not un
likely Ihat some member of this
five will get a chance to play in the
Oakland Auditorium.
Two to one underdogs, with a
record of 3 v/ins in 11 games, and
with every edge in height, material,
and experience belonging to the op
position, the Stanford freshmen take
the floor of the Oakland Auditorium
at 6:30 tomorrow night against the
California Bear Cups.
The Indians realize their only
hope of winning lies in matching
speed with speed, and beating their
rivals at their own game. Tonight a
second-string freshman five faces
Galileo High in the Pavilion. The
game will begin at 7:30 o'clock.
Cal Won First
California won the first game of
the annual Little Big Series, 47-33,
in spite of a fine, fast-breaking of
fense presented by the Indians.
Meeks, Morgan, and Bauer scored
34 points on set-up shots, while
Lory Rothert, Gordon Mallatratt,
and Frank Cox tallied 25 for Stan
ford.
were scored in the first meeting of
were scored in the first meetitng of
the two teams, and with Stanford
out to score quickly and early in
the game, tomorrow night's contest
should be even faster. Many fans
believe that the first California
freshman game was the best game
played in the Stanford Pavilion this
year. Certainly it far outscored the
varsity game for good shooting,
passing, and clean, fast play.
Butte at Center
Saturday night the Indians will
line up as follows: Crowe, center;
C. Coiner and Rothert, forwards;
Mallatratt and Butte, guards. Butte
will work at center on the tip-off
and then fall back to his guard post,
where he is so valuable in getting
the ball off the backboard, and for
breaking up the opposing team's
plays. Coiner gets the nod over Cox
at one forward, largely due to his
good shooting eye at middle range.
Galileo's Lions should win over
the frosh Friday night, if for no
other reason than that Coach Vance
Fawcett will save his best men for
the all-important clash on Saturday
night. Fage, Henry Coiner, Sales,
Mack, and Butts will open the game
against Galileo, and it is not un
likely Ihat some member of this
five will get a chance to play in the
Oakland Auditorium.
