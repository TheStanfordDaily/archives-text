# VARSITY NET TEAM WILL OPPOSE CALIFORNIA TENNIS CLUB IN S. F.
## 
### 
Finally getting a much-needed f
bicak from the weather after two 1
weeks of postponement, seven var- J
sity net experts will meet the strong I
California Tennis Club outfit on the j
Club courts in San Francisco at 1 ;
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
One change has been made in the I
Stanford lineup by Coach Lockwood '
â€”John Gordon for Kelsey Petterson j
as sixth man. Otherwise the same ,
men tackle the same opponents as ;
announced two weeks ago- Gledhill j
(S) vs. Chandler; Coughlin (S) vs.
Stratford; Forbes (S) vs. Neer; Otis
(S) vs. Levy; Weesner (S) vs.
Brown. Gordon will face Dunn.
Doubles contests will be paired i
off as follows: Gledhill and Cough- i
lin (S) vs. Neer and Levy; Forbes
and Weesner (S) vs. Stratford and
Brown; and Otis and Ellis (S) vs.
Detriek and Stracham.
Some pretty fancy tennis will be'
required of the Indian racket men
if they expect to succeed in this
strength test, as four of the club's

six singles representatives are
ranked among the first five in the
state. Bud Chandler, who meets
Gledhill in Ihe feature match, i.s
number one in California, and Ger
ald Stratford, Edmund Levy, and
Phil Neer are second, fourth, and
fifth, respectively.
Gledhill, ranked eighth in the na
tion, may have a slight edge over
Chandler, and Coughlin may be
able to make something of his match
with Stratford. The rest of the
Stanford contingent, however, is
bound to have a tough time.
