# SOPH WOMEN DEFEAT JUNIOR HOOP SQUAD 14-11 IN UPSET TILT
## 
### 
Upsetting all calculations, the i
I sophomore women cagers fought i
i their way to a 14 to 11 victory over j
[the junior quintet in what proved;
i to be the most exciting game yet j
i played this season. Until the last !
five minutes of play neither team j
succeeded in obtaining and keeping j
more than a two-point lead, and i
usually it was only one lone point, i
which isn't very conducive to a
peaceful game.
With the very close guarding that!
j characterized the game, there was j
! little chance for personal exhibi- |
tions. However, Mariafi Parker,.
soph forward, managed to elude her j
guard, and with almost uncanny ac
curacy in many cases piled up the \
J sophomore points. For the juniors,
i Marian Hewlett walked away with '
j the honors.
Al the present time the fresh and
I seniors are tied for first place with
no defeats, while the juniors and |
sophs have one each to their credit. I
