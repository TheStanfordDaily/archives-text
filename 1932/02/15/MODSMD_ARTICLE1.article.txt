# CARD SLUGGERS DEFEAT BRONCS BY 5-2 MARGIN
## Redshirts Score In Three Innings To Win Slow Baseball Game INDIANS SHOW POWER Delmas, Goodell Account For Seven Of Total Fourteen Hits 
### 
Bunching three singles with a
couple of errors by the Santa Clara
infield to score a brace of runs in
the seventh inning and break a 2-2
tie that had lasted since the fourth,
the Stanford varsity baseball team
got off to a shaky start in defense
of its California Intercollegiate
Baseball League title by beating the
visitors 5-2 Saturday.
At times the Redshirts showed
signs of being perhaps better than
last year's championship outfit, but
for the most part they exhibited an
attack that still has a lot of
edges which need smoothing before
the Trojan and Bear series roll
around.
Caddcl Steady
The fact that the Indians made
I I hits off Larry Burke shows that
they were at least hitting the ball,
but the added fact that they had the
astounding tota lof 17 runners left
on the bases shows that they weren't
pounding the ball when hits meant
runs. Four times the Farm boys
were retired with the bases loaded,
and they had an average of ap
proximately three hits needed for
every run scored.
Big Ernie Caddcl pitched the first
seven innings, and except for the
fourth, when they collected two
more bingles, the big senior looked
ft.irly steady. During the time that
he was on the mound he struck out
three and gave only two passes,
which denotes plenty of improve
ment over the past performances of
most Stanford chuckers.
Hrrm Estes hurled the last two
innings, and allowed only one
scratch single, by A1 Dowd, into
"left. The slim right-hander has a
nice curve ball that looks big, but
isn't there when they swing.
Dclnias Better
Bert Delmas returned to form
with the advent of the season, and
collected four good solid blows, that
could have easily gone for extra
bases, out of five attempts. Fred
Goodell also showed improvement,
getting three for five.
Santa Clara scored after Powers
walked, Murray singled, and Breck
ridge singled to bring them both
across. Caddel threw Dowd out at
first, walked Morey, and then forced
Wicsinger and Goldsong to pop out.
In the seventh Morey popped out,
Wicsinger and Goldsong singled, but
Big Ernie struck out Burke and
Schneer flicd to Rintala.
Schneer, who played center field,
got on to the Stanford outfield
early in the season. Reaching second
base in the initial inning he tried to
take third after Powers flied to
Campbell, but Campbell to Delmas
to Trautman cut him down in a
hurry.

In his report for 1915-16, Presi

government as now organized has [

that students have willingly re- !

The fact that the Indians made
I I hits off Larry Burke shows that
they were at least hitting the ball,
but the added fact that they had the
astounding tota lof 17 runners left
on the bases shows that they weren't
pounding the ball when hits meant
runs. Four times the Farm boys
were retired with the bases loaded,
and they had an average of ap
proximately three hits needed for
every run scored.
Big Ernie Caddcl pitched the first
seven innings, and except for the
fourth, when they collected two

he was on the mound he struck out

Bunching three singles with a
couple of errors by the Santa Clara
infield to score a brace of runs in
the seventh inning and break a 2-2
tie that had lasted since the fourth,
the Stanford varsity baseball team
got off to a shaky start in defense
of its California Intercollegiate
Baseball League title by beating the
visitors 5-2 Saturday.
At times the Redshirts showed
signs of being perhaps better than
last year's championship outfit, but
for the most part they exhibited an
attack that still has a lot of
edges which need smoothing before
the Trojan and Bear series roll
around.
Caddcl Steady
The fact that the Indians made
I I hits off Larry Burke shows that
they were at least hitting the ball,
but the added fact that they had the
astounding tota lof 17 runners left
on the bases shows that they weren't
pounding the ball when hits meant
runs. Four times the Farm boys
were retired with the bases loaded,
and they had an average of ap
proximately three hits needed for
every run scored.
Big Ernie Caddcl pitched the first
seven innings, and except for the
fourth, when they collected two
more bingles, the big senior looked
ft.irly steady. During the time that
he was on the mound he struck out
three and gave only two passes,
which denotes plenty of improve
ment over the past performances of
most Stanford chuckers.
Hrrm Estes hurled the last two
innings, and allowed only one
scratch single, by A1 Dowd, into
"left. The slim right-hander has a
nice curve ball that looks big, but
isn't there when they swing.
Dclnias Better
Bert Delmas returned to form
with the advent of the season, and
collected four good solid blows, that
could have easily gone for extra
bases, out of five attempts. Fred
Goodell also showed improvement,
getting three for five.
Santa Clara scored after Powers
walked, Murray singled, and Breck
ridge singled to bring them both
across. Caddel threw Dowd out at
first, walked Morey, and then forced
Wicsinger and Goldsong to pop out.
In the seventh Morey popped out,
Wicsinger and Goldsong singled, but
Big Ernie struck out Burke and
Schneer flicd to Rintala.
Schneer, who played center field,
got on to the Stanford outfield
early in the season. Reaching second
base in the initial inning he tried to
take third after Powers flied to
Campbell, but Campbell to Delmas
to Trautman cut him down in a
hurry.
