# REYNOLDS CALLS SAN JOSE'S JAIL CONDITIONS 'BAD'
## 
### 
A modern Bastile was dis
covered by the members of
Professor C. N. Reynolds'
criminology class when' they
visited the San Jose jail Friday.
The crowded conditions, poor
ventilation, filth, and dirt of
the place caused Reynolds to
state that it was the worst jail
that he has ever seen. A typical
example of the conditions is
found in one section called "the
lank." In this place, which is
rivaled only by the famous
Black Hole of Calcutta, are
cooped 95 men in a space built
for 32. The only ventilation and
light for the place comes
through a small skylight in the
ceiling.
Blame for this does not fall
on the prison officials. They
are as anxious to better the
conditions as anybody else that
knows about them, but they
are powerless to act. The war
den stated that reform will
come only when the people
visit the jails and see the ter
rible shape that they are in.
