# RIFLE CLUB RETAINS UNDEFEATED RECORD
## 
### 
With four more victories to add
to their undefeated record, the I
Stanford rifle team now has six
straight wins to its credit.
Complete tabulation revealed the
fact that Ihe Stanford mark of 1872
exceeded Washington States 1854
and Ohio State's 18f>0. The three
position score of 1394 was good
enough to win over Columbia's 1358,
and the first week's record of 1837
nosed out that of the Mississippi j
Aggies by seven points.
Members of the rifle club and the j
team are at present in competition j
for a trophy donated by Nicol
Smith, Stanford student. Special j
handicaps arc being made for this \
shooting tourney.
