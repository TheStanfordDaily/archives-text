# Japs, Chinese Mass 50,000 Troops For Huge Chapei Battle
## Neutral Mediators Fail in Peace Efforts as Japs Land Troops and Modern Equipment to Smash Hordes of Poorly Armed Chinese 
### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, Feb. 15. (A') —A battle that would make hostilities
around Shanghai during the last three weeks look like a mere
skirmish appeared inevitable today as 50,000 Chinese and Japanese troops
were massed along the Chapei-YVoosung battle front.
The coming of bloodshed on a large scale appeared all the more certain
as feverish efforts of neutral mediators to avoid it met with failure at
every turn. The American, British, and French Ministers spent all of
Sunday seeking a loophole which might open the way for some kind of
negotiations, but achieved no tangible results.
Influential Chinese held numerous conferences trying to conceive some
possible peace plan, but the early hours of Monday found them most

pessimistic. Among the conferees
was T. V. Soong and 11. 11. Kung,
both former Ministers in the former
Nanking government.
Equipment Unloaded
Although the Japanese completed
landing of soldiers from seven
transports at Woosung and in the
International Settlement yesterday,
large gangs of stevedores still were
busy early today unloading equip
ment obviously intended for "a big
push."
The Japanese concealed the num
ber and disposition of troops along
the battle line, but military observ
ers estimated they had at least
215,000 men and ample modern
equipment ready for battle. The
Chinese, meanwhile, continued to
dig into their position and predict
they would die before they gave in.
Chinese Strong
The Chinese manpower apparent
ly was equal to the Japanese, or
even greater, but their equipment,
observers believed, was far inferior.
Out of the holds of the Japanese
transports came tanks, howitzers,
light and heavy artillery, aerial
bombs, and cavalry equipment.
