# PROFESSOR BAILEY HAS LEAD TONIGHT IN P.A. PRODUCTION
## 
### 
Dr. Margery Bailey and four
other campus actors will be seen
tonight in Sidney Howard's "Silver
Ccrd" at the Palo Alto Community
Theatre. Dr. Bailey, prominent
member of the Stanford faculty, is
being starred in the role of the
hateful Mrs. Phelps.
Miss Bailey appeared in several
campus productions while Gordon
Davis was director of Stanford dra
matics. She is probably best remem
bered for her work in "The Torch
Bearers" and "The Swan."
The cast will be as follows:
Mrs. Phelps Margery Bailey
Robert Phelps Robert Brauns
David Phelps Richard Ogg
Christina, David's wife
Corinne Elkins
Hester, Robert's fiancee
Peg Randall Converse
Maid Vivienne Church
Peg Randall Converse has played
in a great many campus plays, her
last role being that of Helen Petti
grew in "Berkeley Square," pre
sented here last quarter. She has
also been seen in the Assembly
Hall, in such plays as "Dulcy" and
"A Kiss for Cinderella." Robert
Brauns, Vivienne Church, and
Richard Ogg are also well known
locally.
"Silver Cord" is a comedy whose
whole effect is so harsh as to be
serious. Due to heavy reserving and
the small capacity of the Commun
ity Theatre the play will be re
peated tomorrow night. "Silver
Cord" has proved itself to be very
popular with theatregoers every
where. The curtain will be at 8
o'clock.
