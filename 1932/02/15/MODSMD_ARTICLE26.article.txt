# BEAR CAGEMEN CAPTURE SLOW 33-16 CONTEST
## Patched Indians Lag 20-6 At Half Time; Cordry Outshines Mates U.C.L.A. TAKES TROJANS Kintana, Read High Point Men For Winners 
### Lowell Cox 
A hastily patched together Stan
ford basketball team proved unequal
to the occasion Saturday night with
the result that the California five
won a dreary 33 to 16 game while
some 8.000 spectators filled the Oak
land Auditorium with their yawns.
Meanwhile a fighting U.C.L.A.
quintet took a 2(5 to 24 decision
over U.S.C. in a lightning-fast
game at Los Angeles to topple
the Trojans from undisputed
league leadership and into a tic
with (he Golden Bears.
The character of the Oakland af
fair quickly became apparent as
California got off to an eight-point
scoring spree in the first six min
utes of play before a single Indian
found the basket. Stanford was get
ting the tip-c>ff, but the Bears would
soon intercept the ball to sweep
down the floor for easy shots at the
Stanford goal.
Crowley Starts Spree
Crowley, starting at guard in place
of Ohashi, opened festivities with a
long one from the side, with Kin
tana following soon after with a
one-handed flip over his shoulder
which found the hoop. A pair of
foul shots by Crowley and an easy
field goal by Read made it eight to
nothing in six minutes.
Cordry sank a free throw and
soon after broke loose under the
basket for a field goal to erase the
goose egg for Stanford on the score
board.
Three-quarters of the way through
the period it was 12 to 6, after
Meade had dribbled half the length
of the floor for a bucket and Cos
grove had dropped in a free throw
to add three tallies to the Stanford
score, while Kintana and Vendt rang
the hoop twice for the Bears.
II had been slow so far, more like
a lethargic practice session than a
game between traditional rivals, but
there was still a chance that it
would develop into something bet
ter.
Bears Rain Goals
A sudden storm of California
goals quickly settled the matter,
however, as Smart, Read, and Crow-
ran up eight points to make the
score 20 to 6 at half time.
The Indians didn't fare quite
so badly in the second half, but
perhaps it was because the Bears
wouldn't take them seriously,
as much as anything else.
It was a sad game for both gal
leries, with only a few spurts of life
to relieve the drab spectacle. The
crowd refused to work up any ex
citement over any part of it, for the
most part remaining so quiet the
giuff remarks of Referee Herb Dana
and Umpire Lloyd Lcith as they
called rule infractions could be
heard over most of the house.
It was simply a case of the rem
r.anes of a once promising team,
patched together in the short space
ot one week after a rough U.S.C.
engagement had taken toll of two
more players, being unable to cope
with a team of championship calibre
Joe Kintana. Nibs Price's fine for
ward. continued at top form to score
10 points, with Read matching him
with an equal number, but neither
looked any better in coasting with
a winning team than Cordry did in
fighting for a hopelessly losi cause.
