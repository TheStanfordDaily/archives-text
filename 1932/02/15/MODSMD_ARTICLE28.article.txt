# PHI BETES VS. ATHLETES
## 
### 
The old controversy of which is the more valuable, a 1
Phi Ueta Kappa key or a college letter won in athletics,;
again rears its head with the investigation of Robert Sibley,
(xcentive secretary of California's alumni association.
The conclusions drawn from his statistics are that Phi
Holes live longer and achieve greater success in after life
than do football stars. In considering 12 Phi Beta Kappas
;.nd 12 football stars who graduated from California ,'!();
years ago, Sibley discovered that ten Phi Holes are still
living and all 12 were listed in Who's Who.
Nine of the athletes investigated are still living and
only one lias been listed in Who's Who.
Sibley apparently lakes as a criterion of success that
volume in which the nation's prominent are listed. If hav
ing your name placed in that catalogue is the ultimate end
of life and sure proof that vou have not lived in vain, then
his conclusions are correct. Hut the long list ot philoso
phers who would have laughed loudly at the suggestion j
thai worldly prominence is the key to success is sufficient
to arouse some doubt as to whether there might not he
some other basis for the successful lite.
Anyway, it is almost a truism that the attainment of j
Phi Heta Kappa rating, although it is the highest scholastic
award, does not repay the student for the loss of virtually
evorvthing else in college. I hat it assures true success in
later life is doubtful.
