# PROGRESS AT MICHIGAN STATE
## 
### 
Screaming, two-inch headlines on the front page ot the
Michigan Stale Xews last week heralded a drastic revision
in the "class-cutting" schedule at the middle-western insti
tution.
Although the story of the change did not outline rules
previously n effect, the move was hailed as a significant
forward step in the structural make-up ot educating,
it anv attempt were made to install at Stanford even the
revamped and more "liberal" Michigan State arrangement,
ii chorus of objection Irom students and faculty alike
would rise to the very rafters of heaven.
The "liberal" part of Ihc cul schedule allows "volun
tary" class attendance for honor students and last-term
seniors. Yet even these must attend more than 75 per cent
of their class sessions to receive credit. Excused as well
as inexcused absences count in this reckoning.
Other students not on probation are warned when their
cuts equal the number of units in any one course, and are
flunked w hen cuts reach double that number. And all this,
mind vou, not during a quarter of less than three months,
bn! throughout a term of something over four months.
Michigan Stale called this progress. To them, perhaps,
the change is ;in improvement. Hut that is not the point.
The pity is in the very existence of an administration-rogu
h.led class attendance stjslrrn. It must entail an enormous
extra expense and effort. It heaps personal responsibilities
of students upon faculty and administration. It fosters
"racket" methods of grade-getting. 11 is the thickest part
of the shell which surrounds the kernel ol college-pre
sented education.
