Spring came; old Sol came
out in full power; visitors came
—but the local rough and his
own private edition of the "500''
(or his import, as the case may
be), went .... and how! That,
in brief, summarizes the situa
tion on the Farm yesterday.
Flivvers to V-16's .... and
every horse on the old planta
tion: they all went out West
.... to the hills, the valleys,
dales .... anyway, where is
it that a young man's fancy
USUALLY turns? In spring,
that is.
And they returned last night,
too. It is rumored that, in the
event of continued good humor
of the Firey Ball, the local en
gagement situation, which got
off to such a fine start this
leap-year, will begin to pick
up again, and soon at that. It
it also rumored (though doubt
ed) that the rough .... (alone
and in his own company) ac
tually went out to those gor
geous foothills behind the
blooming campus .... yes,
.... to study!
