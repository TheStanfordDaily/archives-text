THE RAUCOUS RADIO

Whenever some penny politician
begins to list the advances that bless
this age, radio—which brings the
best in this and that to every home
—is sure to head the list or at least
be a close runner-up. And when
one thinks of radio's possibilities one
tan almost work up an emotional
enthusiasm. But then when one
thinks of actuality, a most morbid,
dejected, and disgusted feeling
sweeps upon lhe individual who
does not think Crosby, Columbo,
and Vallee are the greatest things
that ever hit these United States.
Jazz is great stuff; we like it—in
its place! Jazz has rhythm but is
\ery deficient in melody—it is made
for dancing. And when we gambol
ever the waxed hardwood (and over
ether people's feet), there is prob
ably nothing that can take the place
of popular music. I never heard of
anybody say that we should dance
to the tunes of the great masters —
not even the most rabid anti-jazz
crusaders. The simple sameness of
jazz is ideally suited to herd danc
ing.
But because this stuff is great
when we are pushing her around
and around is no reason at all why
it should be considered the best
thing for radio programs. Cream is
most excellent in coffee; but no one
suggests pouring it in orange or
grapefruit juice. Now a few people
dance to the radio's offerings, but
the number that do is in no ways
comparable to the amount of dance
music that comes irresistibly
streaming over the ether waves. Our

Whenever some penny politician

this age, radio—which brings the
best in this and that to every home
—is sure to head the list or at least
be a close runner-up. And when
one thinks of radio's possibilities one
tan almost work up an emotional

thinks of actuality, a most morbid,
dejected, and disgusted feeling
sweeps upon lhe individual who
does not think Crosby, Columbo,

that ever hit these United States.
