Gap and Cown—cr, Goop and
Can—that is, the Intimate Order of
i Delta Gammas and A Very Few
I Who Are Not Delta Gummas, held
' the durkiest fashion show Saturday,
which revealed to the unfortunate
j individuals attending the worst col-
I lection of limbs, shafts, etcetera,
j that your correspondent (guess
I who?) ever laid eyes upon. We
! hereby move that the name of the
| women's honor society be changed
j to the Order of the Bulging Calf.
The Toyon dance committee
decided to keep the roughs out
of the club formal Friday night,
hut several couples from the Phi
Kap and A.T.O. brawls got in
somehow, so the committee's fine
intentions went for naught.
However, the house committee
beat the Dean of Women's of
fice to the punch by declaring it
open house throughout the
dance.
Maybe we're wrong, but when the
' Daily business staff puts corset ads
| on the sports page, as in Friday's
j paper, it's time for every loyal son
I cf the Slanford Red to rally round.
\ What do they mean—sports?
The Stanford baseball team,
whose roster used to sound like
a Kappa Sig roll-call, won a
! game Saturday with only four
Kappa Sigs in the lineup. Delta
Kappa Epsilon battled their
neighbors hard for high-point
honors, but the l)est they could
do was to get three men on the
field. A Breaker, an Alpha Delt,
and an El Campo hero wan
dered onlo the diamond and

wore put in the game by mis
take, hut Stanford won, never
theless.
; Spring, beautiful spring, has made
|an unannounced appearance down
i hcah on the Fahm, and the roofs of
Fraternity Row will soon be dotted
with the bodies beautiful of every
i thing from Sigma Alpha Epsilon to
Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji to you).
! That masculine tan!
Which reminds us that a lot
I ot people are getting baffled
i daily since the S.A.E. and Fiji i
sophomores have taken to an
swering phones with a trilled
"Sis Alph house" and "Phi Gam
house," respectively. A rose by
any other name is still an S.A.E..
we figure.
It happened at a cozy little stud ,
game in a house on the campus,
j rented by three youths. In walked
i the owner of the house, a member
| ef the Stanford faculty. He was
j certainly gratified to see how his :
' tenants were passing the time. "It's J
j been a long time since I've played i
| poker," he chuckled. "Mind if I sit ;
in?"
No one minded—not audibly, that
: is—and two hours later the prof
arose with the rent for the next six
months. "Come again, boys," he re
marked airily. Moral: Beware of '
sharks in prof's clothing.
