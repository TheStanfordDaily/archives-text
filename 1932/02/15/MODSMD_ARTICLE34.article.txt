Theatre.
This is really good stuff eked out
of the usual romantic Rio Grande
situation well lathered with good
old "mellerdrammer" of the "I'll
shoot myself first" type.
Dolores Del Rio proves herself a
good emotional actress in the part
of the night club entertainer whose
honor is almost constantly in jeop
ardy. She also proves herself very
pleasing to look upon and rarest
wonder of all she has a good sing
ing talk.
Leo Carillo as the wealthy and
conceited Mexican, "the best cabal
lero in all Mexico," self-styled,
swaggers around the screen in an
entirely convincing manner, al
though his accent renders some of
lines, extremely obscure.
The plot itself rambles through
the usual scenes of danger to the
hero, sneers by the villain, and
heroic renunciation by the heroine
to save the life of the hero. Sur
prisingly enough the story pops up
at the crucial moment, just when
we thought it was going to have
another of these pseudo-sophisti-

I Ci>ted sad endings, with a suprise
ending which leaves one fairly
I happy with the lot of the over

Good shorts complete a program
