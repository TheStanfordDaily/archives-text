Willi Coach Harry Welter's base
ball outfit already started on an 18-
j:ame schedule in defense ofÂ» its
C.1.8.L. title, we are reminded of
the fact that last year was the first
lime since 1925 that the Redshirts
had taken a series from the Golden
Bears of Berkeley. But even though
the Indians took the championship,
the.j' lost two of their three defeats
to the men of Troy. There doesn't
seem to be any real reason why the
Southerners should have won the
scries, except that the Farm team
went to sleep in the second game of
both the Trojan, and Bruin series.
Incidentally, while the Indians
were beating the Bears they took
the measure of one Norman "Axe
less" Horner, who had previously
beaten Stanford in his freshman,
sophomore, and junior years.
Horner has recently signed with
the Oakland club of the Pacific
Coast League, which is coached by
the man who turned out the teams
which Horner hurled to victory.
Carl "The Great Zam" Zamloeh
says that if he had nine men like
Norm Horner he would have a vet
( ran aggregation. That's pretty high
praise for a youngster who hasn't
had a crack at the league yet, but
Z; mloch is both a good showman
and a good coach.
In the first game of the season,
against the Olympic Club, the local
fans saw one of those "once in a
lifetime" plays, when Art Hearn
came in to back up Herm Estes on
a fly, and the ball bounced out of
the pitcher's hands and was caught
by the alert first-saeker.
Another hair-raiser was pulled in
the game with the Keneaty Seals,
when one of the paid-tp-play boys
hit a liner to left fie ld. Lenny Gold
mann started in on the blow, took
a look at its speed, backed up a step
and stuck out one hand at the
sphere as it started to curve away
from him. The ball hit his mitt,
bounced straight up in the air, and
came down into the eager hands of
the. 1 speedy left-fielder.
In Saturday's game with Santa
Clara both Trautman and Rintala
were robbed of what started out to
bo sure hits.
Trautman slashed one of Burke's
fj st-breaking curves over the third
baseman's head, and trotted off to
firs! with a hit in the bag, only to
have Beckridge dash in at top speed
and pick the ball oil' his shoe-tops.
Rintala came up with the bases
bulging, two out, and clouted the
bull far out between right and cen
ter fields. The Broncs' new center
fie lder, Schneer, started at the same
time the ball did, and with three
men already across the plat, pulled
the ball down with one hand. If
the infield had done as we'll as the
outfield, Stanford might not be
leading the conference now.
