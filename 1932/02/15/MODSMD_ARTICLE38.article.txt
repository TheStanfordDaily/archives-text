# PEARMAN FINISHES RUNNER-UP IN BAY SABER TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Continuing Stanford's record of I
placing men in all individual meets, I
Fred Pearman finished second in !
last Friday's Bay Division novice j
saber tournament.
Zola, a transfer from U.C.L.A., !
now attending California, won the j
title-. Zola, Pearman, and Edenholm j
of the Olympic Club will all be
( ligible for the Pacific Coast finals.
Pearman had to battle his way
through a field of twelve entries to
{ .-â– . in his berth. The group was di
vided into two "strips" (which is a
fencer's way of saying "sections"), j
which were won by Zola and Pear- j
nan. The three best men in each |
strip competed in the finals, and j
iift.er all the votes had been counted, !
Pearman and Zola were tied for !
first.
Pearman lost the fence-off due to (
his inexperience. Pearman is pri- j
manly a foilsman, which makes his
success with the saber last Friday [
particularly outstanding.
