# Varsity Swimmers Take Olympic Club Mermen
## GARDNER DEFEATS HARGRAVES IN 100 TO SEW UP MEET Pair Of Pacific Association Records Broken, One By Each Team 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
Varsity swimmers have proven j
themselves the first time at bat. ;
Barely nosing out the Olympic Club j
splashers, 27-23, in San Francisco i
i Friday night, the 1032 Indian var
sity has given actual proof of their j
competitive strength, fulfilling the 1
predictions made after their series i
of unofficial records hung up from j
time to time since the beginning of j
the year.
With the meet in doubt until the j
beginning of the final event, victory ;
hinged on the single performance j
of Tuppy Gardner in the 100-yard j
freestyle. Gardner came through, i
barely nosing out Arthur Hargraves
of the Club by 3 or 4 inches, to take j
second behind John McKelvey, thus
marking down the winning tallies, j
The 220 followed, first and second i
places easily going to Wiget and !
Clapp, respectively. The race was:
practically a tie, but the judges!
finally threw their weight in favor i
of the sophomore store. Frank
Mooney took third.

Not the least of the evening's I
events were the 400-yard relay and j
100-yard backstroke, in which Pa- 1
cific Association records were es- j
tablished. Austin Clapp, who hasn't |
swum backstroke in a meet for some :
j two years, pulled a surprise by
| forcing Hargraves, who alreaely !
, holds the Pacific Association cham- j
j pionship, to a new record, even I
beating out Captain Frank Booth. ;
The new mark is 1:04.4.
Stanford already held the Pacific \
Association 400-yarcl relay record
of 3:48.4 minutes, made in 1926, and
turned around Friday to lower this
mark to 3:45.7, the efforts of Ted
Wiget, John McKelvey, Frank!
i Booth, and Tuppy Gardner not be- j
j ing expended in vain. Of the six j
j events, the Clubmen took the three !
they chose, the Indians doing the
J same by their three choices.
Cards Lose Water Polo
Turning around to get their re- 1
! venge in the water polo contest, the i
| Winged-O took a 9-6 win over the j
Indians. For the Club, Burns, Wil- ;
; kinson, and Decato held down the j
forward positions, Mitchell, Schroth,
and Dunn were backs, and Colletle j
■ performed as goalie. Burns, Wilkin- |
son, Decato, and Mitchell netted !
i two goals each, with Schroth ac- j
; counting for one.
Wiget and Clapp, however, tied j
! for high-point honors for both
I teams, with three tallies apiece. |
Frank Booth sprinted for the Cards ,
, instead of Wiget, who usually holds ;
j clown that position on all occasions,
j Booth managed to get the tip-off j
j most of the time, leaving little to !
| be desired, considering the tremen- 1
! clous strength of the Club outfit. The
| other two forwards were Clapp and
! Wiget, with Kinkead and Harris at
j guard, Woods at center back, and i
Knapp at goal.
Complete results: 400-yard relay j
—won by Stanford team, composed j
of Wiget, McKelvey, Booth, and j

Not the least of the evening's I
events were the 400-yard relay and j
100-yard backstroke, in which Pa- 1
cific Association records were es- j
tablished. Austin Clapp, who hasn't |
swum backstroke in a meet for some :
j two years, pulled a surprise by
| forcing Hargraves, who alreaely !
, holds the Pacific Association cham- j
j pionship, to a new record, even I
beating out Captain Frank Booth. ;
The new mark is 1:04.4.
Stanford already held the Pacific \
Association 400-yarcl relay record
of 3:48.4 minutes, made in 1926, and
turned around Friday to lower this
mark to 3:45.7, the efforts of Ted
Wiget, John McKelvey, Frank!
i Booth, and Tuppy Gardner not be- j
j ing expended in vain. Of the six j
j events, the Clubmen took the three !
they chose, the Indians doing the
J same by their three choices.

Turning around to get their re- 1

| Winged-O took a 9-6 win over the j
Indians. For the Club, Burns, Wil- ;
; kinson, and Decato held down the j
forward positions, Mitchell, Schroth,
and Dunn were backs, and Colletle j
■ performed as goalie. Burns, Wilkin- |
son, Decato, and Mitchell netted !
i two goals each, with Schroth ac- j
; counting for one.
Wiget and Clapp, however, tied j
! for high-point honors for both
I teams, with three tallies apiece. |

Varsity swimmers have proven j
themselves the first time at bat. ;
Barely nosing out the Olympic Club j
splashers, 27-23, in San Francisco i
i Friday night, the 1032 Indian var
sity has given actual proof of their j
competitive strength, fulfilling the 1
predictions made after their series i
of unofficial records hung up from j
time to time since the beginning of j
the year.
With the meet in doubt until the j
beginning of the final event, victory ;
hinged on the single performance j
of Tuppy Gardner in the 100-yard j
freestyle. Gardner came through, i
barely nosing out Arthur Hargraves
of the Club by 3 or 4 inches, to take j
second behind John McKelvey, thus
marking down the winning tallies, j
The 220 followed, first and second i
places easily going to Wiget and !
Clapp, respectively. The race was:
practically a tie, but the judges!
finally threw their weight in favor i
of the sophomore store. Frank
Mooney took third.

Not the least of the evening's I
events were the 400-yard relay and j
100-yard backstroke, in which Pa- 1
cific Association records were es- j
tablished. Austin Clapp, who hasn't |
swum backstroke in a meet for some :
j two years, pulled a surprise by
| forcing Hargraves, who alreaely !
, holds the Pacific Association cham- j
j pionship, to a new record, even I
beating out Captain Frank Booth. ;
The new mark is 1:04.4.
Stanford already held the Pacific \
Association 400-yarcl relay record
of 3:48.4 minutes, made in 1926, and
turned around Friday to lower this
mark to 3:45.7, the efforts of Ted
Wiget, John McKelvey, Frank!
i Booth, and Tuppy Gardner not be- j
j ing expended in vain. Of the six j
j events, the Clubmen took the three !
they chose, the Indians doing the
J same by their three choices.
Cards Lose Water Polo
Turning around to get their re- 1
! venge in the water polo contest, the i
| Winged-O took a 9-6 win over the j
Indians. For the Club, Burns, Wil- ;
; kinson, and Decato held down the j
forward positions, Mitchell, Schroth,
and Dunn were backs, and Colletle j
■ performed as goalie. Burns, Wilkin- |
son, Decato, and Mitchell netted !
i two goals each, with Schroth ac- j
; counting for one.
Wiget and Clapp, however, tied j
! for high-point honors for both
I teams, with three tallies apiece. |
Frank Booth sprinted for the Cards ,
, instead of Wiget, who usually holds ;
j clown that position on all occasions,
j Booth managed to get the tip-off j
j most of the time, leaving little to !
| be desired, considering the tremen- 1
! clous strength of the Club outfit. The
| other two forwards were Clapp and
! Wiget, with Kinkead and Harris at
j guard, Woods at center back, and i
Knapp at goal.
