# SAM EASTMAN RUNS 880 IN GOOD TIME; GRAY MAKES GOOD EARLY SEASON TOSS
## 
### 
I Deciding that brother Ben wasn't)
' the only member of the family who j
I could run the 830, Sam Eastman
! stepped out last Friday afternoon 1
! and recorded a neat 2:01 half-mile.
The time, while hardly in a class !
| with Ben's best, is good in view of !
i the immature stage of the season
j and Sam's lack of experience as a 1
; half-miler. It also is distinctly en- i
| couraging as Sam is being counted
i on to supply much strength in the J
distance races.
The track managers finally ,
showed up with a tape on Friday, I
and one of Nellie Gray's best shot- j
! putting efforts was measured at 40 j
i feet 2 inches. That mark is but 1 1 •> :
j less than Nellie's best of last season. !
! John Lyman was less than a foot !
behind Nellie, heaving the iron ball j
i 48 feet 6 inches.

j The rest of Friday's trials were
devoted to the freshmen, and A1
i Blackman as usual ran away with
| the honors. This time he registered
:21.8 in the 220, which needs no
j apology in any kind of competition.
. The first official glimpse of fresh
man half-milers showed that a gen
-1 t lonian by the name of Harris is
i capable of 2:00 at this time of the
| year and should improve. Last year
i at this stage of the season, the frosh
! half-milers weren't any better, but
I it will be remembered that Bobby
I Burch won the 880 in the Little Big
| Meet.
Ward Vincent again proved him
! pelf the best of the yearling 440
' men when he recorded :54 seconds.
• Puss Monroe failed to show his best
| high-school form in the lows, but he
j did demonstrate decided improve
! ment when he ran a full flight in
I :2G.5.

i Blackman as usual ran away with
| the honors. This time he registered

j apology in any kind of competition.
. The first official glimpse of fresh
man half-milers showed that a gen
-1 t lonian by the name of Harris is
i capable of 2:00 at this time of the
| year and should improve. Last year
i at this stage of the season, the frosh
! half-milers weren't any better, but
I it will be remembered that Bobby
I Burch won the 880 in the Little Big
| Meet.
Ward Vincent again proved him
! pelf the best of the yearling 440
' men when he recorded :54 seconds.
• Puss Monroe failed to show his best
| high-school form in the lows, but he
