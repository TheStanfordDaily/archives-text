# CARD HOOPMEN LOSE 40-20 TO BERKELEY CUBS
## Visitors' Superior Height Proves Too Much For Indian Yearlings 
### 
The old, old story of a good big •
man and a good little man prevailed j
again in the Oakland Auditorium |
Saturday night, as the California j
freshmen won their second victory
over the Stanford yearlings, 40-20,
and thereby clinched their fourth
Little Big Series in eight years. The
Bear Cubs had the height.
California led at half time, 19-13,
after the speedy Indian yearlings
had stubbornly outplayed the Cubs, j
but were unable to cope with the i
height of their opponents and the ;
brilliant shooting of Dave Meek and '
Bill Mackey. These two men ac- j
counted for thirteen and twelve j
points, respectively, and most of j
the damage was done in the first j
half.
Instrumental in keeping the j
Papooses within shouting distance j
of their rivals was the excellent •
center play of Tom Kelly in the |
first half. Kelly sank three baskets j
and, all in all, turned in his best ,
game of the year.
But if there was any hero's crown |
for the losers it belonged to Henry !
Coiner, the game little substitute '
forward who h;is been playing all ;
ye ar under the handicap of a con- j
stantly recurring shoulder injury.
Dave Meek, former Redlands |
High athlete, starred for California. |
His speed, height, and shooting eye j
should help him make basketball
history before he has finished play
inn; for "Nibs" Price's varsities.
