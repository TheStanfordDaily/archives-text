# NET MEN DROP CLOSE CONTEST TO CLUB TEAM
## Gledhill Takes Chandler In Straight Sets As Indians Lose, 5-2 
### 
Iri their first test of the season,
the varsity net team went up to
San Francisco and took a 5-2 drub
bing at the hands of the California
Tennis Club, an outfit far stronger
than any the Cards will meet in
collegiate circles this season. As an
indicator of the team's strength,
however, the count was really 5-4,
since Captain Keith Gledhill's dou
ble win was not counted on the
team score, and was technically a
pair of exhibition matches. If Gled
hill took part in a match this quar
ter, he would be ineligible for play
spring quarter, when the actual
tennis season takes place.
Gledhill took Bud Chandler,
ranked number three in the state,
in straight sets, 6-4, 8-6, and,
teamed with Joe Coughlin, account
ed for a doubles victory. The only
other wins were turned in by
Coughlin and John Gordon.
The lone doubles win gracing the
Stanford efforts was a terrific three
set affair, ending in (5-4, 3-6, 12-10—
terrific mostly because of the last
set. Levy and Neer, of the Club,
had point-set at least once, but on
this occasion Gledhill lifted a high
lrb into the blue. It landed just on
the backline, and the Indians pro
ceeded from there to deliver the
winning set of strokes.
Two other matches went to three
sets. Coughlin's contest with Jerry
Stratford carried to 6-4, 3-6, 9-7,
and Stratford and Brown were

forced to 6-4, 4-6, 9-7 in defeating
' Forbes and Weesner.
