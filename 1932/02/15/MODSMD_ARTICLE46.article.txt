# ALAMEDA HIGH COPS 6-5 VERDICT WHEN YEARLINGS BLOW HERINGER'S 3-0 LEAD
## 
### 
After holding their high-school
I opponents scoreless for the first five
| innings and piling up three runs
themselves, the Stanford freshmen
! blew up in the final frame and
har.ded the initial game of the sea
son to the Alameda High School
term, 6-5.
Fred Heringer, star yearling
chucker, pitched winning ball for
the five innings that he worked, and
, was responsible for all three of the
I runs that the baby Redshirts hung
up during the first hali' of the con
! test. Coming to bat in the second
, inning, Heringer found one of
Pitcher Amaral's offerings to his
liking and clouted the ball over the
left field fence. Again, in the fourth,
with Kurtz on base, the big
! chucker landed on a straight ball
[ i;nd sent it well over the center
fielder's head.

A! Scmmelroth worked the last
three innings, and except for the
! last period might have gotten away
j with a victory.
Entering the final inning with a
, H-o lead, Semmelroth filled the
! bases, before getting two out. Under
these circumstances, with Pitcher
Helmstein at bat, the freshmen
i should have been able to strangle
the rally. But the prep hurler caught
hold of one and sent it into deep
left field for a double, scoring three
j runs.
And that was the final score when
the game was called in the eighth.
| The other two freshman tallies
I came in the fourth, when Kurtz
bi ought in "Pepper" Martin, and
the seventh, when Fred Heringer
I hit a long fly to right, rounded the
| rest of the distance on errors, and
; chalked up the final freshman
1 mat ker.
