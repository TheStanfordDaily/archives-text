# CREDIT RELEASE BILL RUSHED BY HOUSE, SENATE
## Speedy Passage Seen For Huge Measure Freeing Gold Surpluses 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. (/P) —
Congress is to pour new blood into
the Nation's clotted credit channels
this week by release of $750,000,000
in gold from the Treasury.
The Glass-Steagall bill to expand
the workings of the Federal Reserve
system already bears committee ap
proval in both the Senate and House
and has a legislative right of way
to insure prompt enactment.
Party leaders expect little diffi
culty in placing it before President
Hoover by the end of the week for
his signature.
Unemployed Relief Next
Meanwhile, the question of relief
for the unemployed through direct
Federal appropriation reaches the
showdown stages in the Senate.
Definite action tomorrow on the La
Follette-Costigan measure or the
Democratic substitute is hoped for
by leaders.
Apparently a majority of the Sen
ate favors some sort of relief legis
lation, but the form it will take ad
mittedly is uncertain.
Republican chieftains claim they
have sufficient strength to defeat
the La Follette-Costigan measure to
provide $375,000,000 for grants to
Stales and $375,000,000 for road con
struction. The Democratic counter
proposal for loans to States for re
lief and road construction appears
to be more strongly intrenched.
To Resume Tax Study
Search for $1,241,000,000 in addi
tional revenue in 1933 to balance
the Federal budget will be resumed
by the House Ways and Means
Committee tomorrow with a study
of a proposed selective manufac
turers' sales tax.
