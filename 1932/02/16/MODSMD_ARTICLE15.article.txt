EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second of two articles on the history
of the Honor Code at Stanford.)

In Iho A.S.S.U. Handbook for
11*21-22, it is stated, '"The Honor
System is now in effect at Stanford.
Prior to this time the .system has
been employed only in a few de
partments of the University. By the
sanction of the faculty, it was made
to cover all departments, the fac
ulty, however, retaining the privi

Council Representative
"The Council is not an adminis

discipline and censorship to the
various students. Rather is it a

have been elected by their fellows
to represent them in matters that
are essential to the well-being of
Stanford as a great University."
A period of comparative inactivity
between 1922 and 192.) was ended
by the statement of President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, in li) 2. r ), "The .suc
cessful development of the honor
system at Stanford and elsewhere
shows how keen is the sense of
moral values in our youth. They
have faith, vision, and charity."
Honor Pledge
On September 30. 1!)2(>, an honor
pledge was incorporated into the
matriculation book, chiefly at the
instigation of Stanley A. Weigcl,
then A.S.S.U. president. Its terms
stated: "I agree to live up to the
lcttci' and spirit of the student honor
system by honesty in all my per
sonal conduct and by neither giving
nor receiving unpermited aid in
examinations, class exercises, or any
o'her work that is to be used by
the instructor as a basis of grading.
"If I violate this pledge, I agree
to withdraw from the University."
On April 17, 1928. Louis R. Vin
ci nti, chairman of Men's Council,
defined standards of honesty to be
observed in reports and term papers.
' Unless express exceptions are made
by the professor the report is ex
pected to be entirely the original
work of the student. Any parts
which are copied from books, maga
zines, or other manuscripts are ex
pected to be enclosed in quotation
marks. A failure to so acknowledge
the writing as that of another is not
only a breach of the Honor System
but a violation of one of the funda
mental rules of English.

"The same rule applies to the
bibliography appended to any re

an article means that the student
h;is read that article prior to writ
ing his report.
"The council considers the writ
ing of a report in violation of these
rules as a seriou.s breach of the
Honor System and will punish it
accordingly."
In 11)28 the name of the institu
tion was changed from "Honor Sys- |
tem' to "Honor Code."
In the Stanford Daily, Dr. Wilbur
wrote an article on February 5.
1929, stating: "The Stanford diploma
of last year had a dusky hue; those
this year will not be white. It is
entirely within the power of the
students to make this right."
Pledge Abolished
The honor pledge of 192f! was
;>bolished in 1929, when, on Febru
ary 21, Registrar J. P. Mitchell an
nounced that the present statement
on the bluebooks would be substi
tuted for it, and that a greatly modi- j
fied pledge would be incorporated
into the matriculation book, to be
signed only once during each stu
<l« lit';-, college caieel".

In 1930* Dean of Men George B.
Culver said, "If the students them
selves do not render effective con
trol, I am of the opinion that the
University should take over the
whole conduct of examinations."
Realizing the gravity of the situa
tion, and in an endeavor to remedy
't, Men's and Women's Councils in
1931 set, for the first time, specific
penalties for definite offenses. A
policy of drastic punishments for
violations was adopted, together
with the signed statement on blue

books.
During last autumn quarter, Men's
Council renewed a program of edu
cating freshmen to the principles of
the Honor Code, with the view of
gradually eliminating ignorance re
garding the Code from the entire
student body. Its program, somewhat >
similar to one adopted several years
previously, was designed also to in
still in the minds of students re- j
spect for the Code and understand
ing of it.
Last month wtfs inaugurated an I
entirely new "Freshman Men's i
Council," which is to have charge of j
