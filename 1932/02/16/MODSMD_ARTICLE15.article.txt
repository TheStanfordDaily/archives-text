EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second of two articles on the history
of the Honor Code at Stanford.)

In Iho A.S.S.U. Handbook for
11*21-22, it is stated, '"The Honor
System is now in effect at Stanford.
Prior to this time the .system has
been employed only in a few de

small group of Stanford men who
have been elected by their fellows
to represent them in matters that
are essential to the well-being of
Stanford as a great University."
A period of comparative inactivity
between 1922 and 192.) was ended
by the statement of President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, in li) 2. r ), "The .suc
cessful development of the honor
system at Stanford and elsewhere
shows how keen is the sense of
moral values in our youth. They
have faith, vision, and charity."
Honor Pledge
On September 30. 1!)2(>, an honor
pledge was incorporated into the
matriculation book, chiefly at the
instigation of Stanley A. Weigcl,
then A.S.S.U. president. Its terms
stated: "I agree to live up to the
lcttci' and spirit of the student honor
system by honesty in all my per
sonal conduct and by neither giving
nor receiving unpermited aid in
examinations, class exercises, or any
