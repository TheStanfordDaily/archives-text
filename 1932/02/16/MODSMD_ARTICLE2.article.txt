# MINIATURE BOOKS ON DISPLAY IN LIBRARY EXHIBIT THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Unique is perhaps the best ad
jtctive one can apply to the new
library exhibit, which has to do
with miniature books. Arthur Wal
lace Browne, who is the owner of
the exhibit, has collected such in
teresting articles as the world's
tiniest printed book, which is printed
from "fly's eye" type, about one
thirtieth of an inch in size, and was
set under a microscope.
Lilliputian-like newspapers are
also on display in the exhibit, five
inch papers with minute advertise
ments and headlines on their small
surfaces. Other interesting small
printing works are Mr. Rudge's 1 1-3
inch reduction of the London
' News-Letter," his try-out pocket
size edition of the New Yoi'k tele
phone directory, and some thirty or
forty diminutive editions of such
books as "Lincoln" and the "Eng
lish Dictionary."
And then, last but not least, there
are some "ponies" used by Chinese
students for hundreds of years—
tiny printed booklets on classics
which were secreted on their per
sons until time of need arrived. The
exhibit is unusual enough not to be
missed by anyone.
