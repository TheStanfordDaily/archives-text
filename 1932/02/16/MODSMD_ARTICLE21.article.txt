SHANGHAI, Feb. 16. (/P>—Japan withheld her l.ig drive today, appar
ently determined to wait for still more guns and troops in order that there
might be no repetition of the bitter experience at Chapei, where out
numbered Japanese bluejackets were repulsed by a suddenly bellicose

cerned. New Howitzer batteries were
i pu! in the line, and the infantrymen
worked desperately to strengthen
their secondary defenses. Extra sup
; plies of ammunition were issued to
j Chinese machine gun detachments.
At the same time approximately
10,000 men of the foreign garrison—
| including the Americans, British,
and French—improved the defenses
they have raised around the Inter
| national Settlement and the French
I concession.

authorities feared disorders in other
parts of China were seen in an an
j nouncement that Americans living
1 along the lower Yangtze valley had
been advised to cvacuate. Other for
j eigners also were reported to be
getting out of the interior.
The American Consulate said it
j had advised evacuation of interior
| cities of China within 100 miles of
Shanghai. The 100 United States
j citizens living in Soochow were told
' it would be better to move, and
about sixty-five Americans living
in Wusih, Changchow, Kiangyu, and
i Changchu received the same ad
j vice. These persons were informed
I they would be safer within the
' Shanghai International Settlement.
