# VARSITY DEBATERS MEET C.O.P. HERE; ARGUE DEPRESSION
## 
### 
Still striving to argue away the
depression, Stanford's varsity "Jc
baters will engage in a forensic
contest with the College of the Pa
cific in the Little Theatre on Wed
nesday evening at 8 o'clock.
The debate question, "Resolved,
Thai Congress should enact legisla
tion providing for the centralized
control of industry," hinges on gov
ernment interference in the field of
business in attempts to eliminate
the present economic depression.
Fresh from debates with the word
siingers from Southern California
on last Thursday, James Bednar,
who debated the Trojans here, and
James Vizzard, who made the trek
to Los Angeles to represent Stan
ford, will take the rostrum against
the men from Stockton. The third
member of the Stanford affirmative
team will be David McDaniel.
