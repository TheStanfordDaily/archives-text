This two-week-old volume of the Daily will begin a
search for new blood Thursday. On that day, prospective
journalists with reportorial ambition will gather in the
Press Ruilding to toe the mark in a fortnight race for regu
lar jobs of ncwsgalhering on the Farm.
Activities have always played a large pari in Stanford
life. To be lived to the full, college years must hold more
than just study and living group associations. All give
gratifying self-satisfaction; most provide fun and a wider
circle of companionship; some afford instruction and train
ill g that is of particular value in later life.
The Daily is a composite of all of these. It's a tough
row. at times, lids journalism racket; yet the fun and thrill
are always present. And especially to aspiring newspaper
men, it offers invaluable experience.
(Lome around, whether freshman, sophomore, or junior;
whether contemplating journalism as a life work or merely
as a pastime. There are scores of good writers yet to be
uncovered on this campus. Perhaps some of them have
never had newspaper experience. Perhaps they are wan
dering this way and that, undecided upon the field of en
deavor for which they are particularly suited.
Have a fling at writing; the Daily can always use a good
writer, and maybe you need the Daily, either as an outside
activity to provide friends and fun or as an experience
through which to test or improve your ability.
Of the many who turn out. several will succeed in this
lirst step. Others will fail. Still others will climb upwards
and onwards until they themselves, some day, may be writ
ing just such an editorial as this.
