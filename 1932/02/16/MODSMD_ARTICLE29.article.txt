# SAFETY FIRST
## 
### 
Faced v. i'ii the vital task of making the game safe for
the players, the football rules committee appears to have
tackled its problem in a very decisive fashion. II was ob
vious that something had to be done to prevent a recur
rence of last year's 22 fatalities, and the committee has
taken real steps toward that end.
It is, of course, impossible to tell just what the result of
the changes will be until they can be tried in actual compe
tition. It may be that some of the new rules are too drastic;
time may show that one or two of them are unnecessary,
but in view of the fact that too-lenient regulations may bring
death to students engaged in a friendly game the authori
ties are not to be blamed for being on the safe side.
Probably the most important innovations from the
safety standpoint are the prohibition ol tiie "rabbit punch,'"
the wailop on the back of the neck which defensive linemen
use to soften up their opponents, and the more liberal sub
stitution rule.
Completely barred in boxing, the rabbit punch is gen
erally conceded to have bad effects on the brain and to put
a player in such condition that he may be injured more
easily by a fall or tackle than would ordinarily be the case.
The offensive man has no defense against it, and no ef
fective head-gear lias been devised to nullify it.
Many men have fallen victims to their own unwilling
ness to leave the game w hen they had no chance to return.
AYitli the old rule of no return to the game in the same
half, a badly tired or slightly injured player usually pre
ferred to stick it out rather than leave the field, a practice
which often had serious results.
The other new regulations, padding on hard equipment,
no flying tackle or block, punt or drop-kick permitted on
kick-off, restrictc d kick-off formation, ball dead w hen any
part of runner except hands or feet touches the ground,
have the same object of safeguarding the athletes, but it is
questionable whether they are all necessarv.
The Hying tackle question is almost certain to cause
much controversy among officials; so is the dead ball rule,
which is also likely to stop many brilliant runs if the ball
carrier loses his footing for an instant without being
tackled. Soft padding, however, is obviously a safety fac
tor, while the new style kick-off should lessen the mass
impact of interference on the return; it can hardlv do anv
harm to the game.
