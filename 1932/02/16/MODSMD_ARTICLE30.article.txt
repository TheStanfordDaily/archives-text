# BULL SESSION
## JAPAN MOVES IN 
### 
Japan landed marines in Shanghai I
to protect its merchants against iho [
attacks of Chinese citizens. They j
will soon have accomplished their \
mission for there will soon be no |
more Chinese citizens to attack |
Japanese merchants. They will all I
have become intimately associated J
with flying bits of shell. It is j
clrimed that Japan is doing no more |
than the United Slates has done at j
various and sundry times among j
the so-called independent nations of ■
(ho Carribean. Theoretically, yes; j
but actually, the situation is dif- i
ierent.
When we move in, we move in j
with such efficiency that before !
long tho entire matter is all cleared j
up. We piled them himh at Vera i
Ciuz but we did it with a bang, and i
not with the protracted buzzing j
with which Japan acts. The trouble
is that Japan can never beat the J
Chinese—there are too many of '
them; and oven to temporarily win '
a victory, means a real war —oven
though none is officially declared.
As a result, Japan is due for some j
severe criticism.
I
But the real reason why Japan {
suffers such verbal chastisement is j
due to the common delusion that |
wo are living in a different world j
fundamentally than the world before I
the World War. The Kellogg Pact — |
where before the war there was j
none—is a sweet lullaby. Disarma- j
ment conferences—where none sue- !
ceeded before the war—seem genu
nine advances. Perhaps they are.
Superficially — for economic and
propaganda purposes—a new era is
ushered in; actually, the same basic

| principle of might makes l ight or at
i least might gets what it wants rules.
! The League of Nations has prob
] ably suffered as much as anybody
! clue to this recent Oriental Flash -
I in-the-Pan which looks as if it
i might even consume the pan itself.
' It has been 100 per cent impotent.
This may be because it lacks power;
1 but the actual situation remains
I nevertheless. Peace workers and
1 peace organizations —like the League
—are not working on the correct
; principle. They attempt to operate
i intellectually when it is emotion
that rules.
| Pease needs some Pep — some
bang—some ballyhoo. Meet fire with
; double doses of fire. Let Peace use
: the same tactics that high-pressure
i nationalists feature. Facts are de
sirable; but they rarely change emo
lions. League bulletins should be
; published in stirring colors—not a
! monotonous white. They should be
' simple and jammed with cartoons
and doggerels that sway people. Let
them study the war propaganda of
j any first-rate power; and then let
' them' use similar methods in work
! ing for peace.
j
It is highly desirable to get the
I information that the League pub-
I fishes; it is great for debates—if one
i finds the continued courage to wade
I through the stuff. But no revolu
i tionary changes in public opinion
j will ever be realized by these
! pamphlets. And it is a hoary truism
that until the people think peace,
all the treaties in the world will be
little more than pious expressions
of diplomatic faith.

Japan landed marines in Shanghai I
to protect its merchants against iho [
attacks of Chinese citizens. They j
will soon have accomplished their \
mission for there will soon be no |
more Chinese citizens to attack |
Japanese merchants. They will all I
have become intimately associated J
with flying bits of shell. It is j
clrimed that Japan is doing no more |
than the United Slates has done at j
various and sundry times among j
the so-called independent nations of ■
(ho Carribean. Theoretically, yes; j
but actually, the situation is dif- i
ierent.
When we move in, we move in j
with such efficiency that before !
long tho entire matter is all cleared j
up. We piled them himh at Vera i
Ciuz but we did it with a bang, and i
not with the protracted buzzing j
with which Japan acts. The trouble
is that Japan can never beat the J
Chinese—there are too many of '
them; and oven to temporarily win '
a victory, means a real war —oven
though none is officially declared.
As a result, Japan is due for some j
severe criticism.
I
But the real reason why Japan {
suffers such verbal chastisement is j
due to the common delusion that |
wo are living in a different world j

the World War. The Kellogg Pact — |
where before the war there was j
none—is a sweet lullaby. Disarma- j
ment conferences—where none sue- !
ceeded before the war—seem genu
nine advances. Perhaps they are.
