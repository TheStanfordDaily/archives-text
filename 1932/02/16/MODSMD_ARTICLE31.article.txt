# HINKLE TELLS OF SNAPPY DIALOGUE IN NEXT PRODUCTION
## 
### George Hinkle 
To both those who extravagantly
praise and those who violently con
demn modern comedy of the "draw- |
ing-room" kind, Stanford's produc- j
tion of Saki's "The Mistiness of
Brieny," ought to mean much. Saki, I
now remote enough to be called the
"father" of something-or-other, is
really the parent of those bright
' young people who have sought to
put into novels and plays a kind of
' s.ticky fudge of English country-life
| ritual and Long Island futility, with
i just enough of a dash of Belgravia—
| enough to violently attract young
' actors with voices in the upper
register and accents of the clip-and
slur school euphemistically called
'"English."
Eut the brood would never recog- 1
i nlze him if it met him face-to-face, i
H. H. Munro was a modest and
! (aettul young man with quite un
-1 spectacular interest in the realities j
j anci absurdities of life, an absorb
ing passion for public affairs, and a
whole-souled faith in the blessing j
iof good sport upon the English
'schoolboy. He trained himself as a J
■ writer in the exacting school of I
British journalism, and he earned i
I praise and respect in the first place |
; from critics and observers of poli- i
I lies. Lastly, while he seemed to ful
i fill the destiny of a generation of j
I young men who are now variously j
: called "lost" or "futile," for he died j
in the War, his end was quite cas- {
; ual. unforeseen, and void of heroics, j
' Saki" is known to Americans
i chiefly through such volumes of
j shert-stories as "The Chronicles of
! Clevis," "Boasts and Super-Beasts," j
j and "The Toys of Peace." Few j
j readers will ever forget such bril- !
! liant tales as that of Tobermory, the !
j lalking cat who scandalized a mori
| ln;nd house-party, or that of Eshley,
j the thwarted painter of lazy cows,
j who created a new genre and earned
I undying fame overnight by painting
| an ox frightened by chance into his j
J neighbor's morning-room. These j
| stories are strewn from end to end
with exotic beasts: stoats, hyenas,
! stags, and tigers; with precocious
J children, with-a genius for horrid
i behavior, who are never punished,
j and with stupid children who are
j unimaginative enough to be good
I and who suffer accordingly; wiih
j people with strange occupations: \
Grand Dukes, traveling salesmen !
from Luxembourg, inventors of j
1 scmare eggs; with brilliant and age
less men and idle and graceful
! women, both sets strangely seem
i ing busy and preoccupied even
1 though they aren't.
And through this fantastic scene
| there roam any number of the
commonplaces of daily life: prigs,
bores, rakes, dullards, beggars, and
professional liars; city clerks, vege
' (able gardeners, worried politicians;

a rapid and easeful play oi dialogue.
| It is this dialogue that has led so
j many readers to miscall Saki's style
