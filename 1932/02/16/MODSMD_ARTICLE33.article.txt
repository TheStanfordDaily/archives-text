# HURDLERS' ABILITY WILL DECIDE CARD TRACK PROSPECTS
## 
### Dick Strouse 
Only six real stars —Podge Smith,
A1 Nisbet, Hec Dyer, Arnie West,
Maynor Shove, and Bob Brown—
have been lost to Stanford's 1932
track team from last year's powerful
squad. But it so happens that Smith
and Nisbet were both hurdlers, in
fact, very good hurdlers. Which has
caused Stanford track enthusiasts to
bitterly bemoan the weakness of
the timber-topping events this year.
Brugniaii Good
There are several reasons, how
ever, why the current depression
need not extend to the hurdle
events on the Indian track schedule.
The first of these reasons is letter
man Jack Brugman, who has had
the misfortune of spending two
years of his collegiate track career
chasing Smith and Nisbet around.
Brugman came to Stanford with
the Illinois interscholastic high hur
dles championship safely tucked
away among his souvenirs. He had
run :15.8 in high school, and then
spent his freshman year at Crane
College.
Last season Brugman ran the
highs in :14.9 and was close to :15
flat most of the time. He finished
third in the Big Meet and did the
same thing at Fresno, where he ran
his best race. Jack got to the semi
finals in the 1.C.4-A.'s last year and,
according to ex-Captain Podge
Smith, Brugman should be among
the best of the coast's high hurdlers
this season.
Low Hurdles
The present ace of the low hur
dlers, Cotto Herbert, also suffered
from an overdose of Smith and Nis
bet. In last year's Big Meet, Cotto
finished exactly three inches behind
Bcnshue and Brophy of California,
who tied for third. And in the S.C.
meet, Herbert was also fourth.

In his freshman year, Herbert j
was undefeated in both the lows!
and the highs until the Little Big j
Meet. In that affair, he fell when he '
v. as leading the lows, but finished
i second in the highs behind his
teammate, Folda. Cotto concentrated j
|on the lows last season, and ran
j about :24.7. He should knock nearly |
1 a second off of that lime if he can
i learn to start faster, as his finish is
j equal to that of the best of the
j hurdlers he has met.
I In addition to Brugman and Her- j
' bert, the varsity boasts Dean Stal
lings, who has a junior college
1 mark of :15.1 in the highs. Stallings
| has had little chance to show much
! at Stanford so far, as an appendec- :
; tomy, although it found no injured
' appendix, nevertheless slowed up
his training.
Stallings set his junior college
i record in Salt Lake City, Utah. If :
I Dean can get back in his best Mor
! mon form he may give the lcng
| legged Mr. Brugman something to
I worry about.
Woolley To Compete
; Another transfer, Cecil Woolley i
by name, has not been heard of
| much around the campus, but he
may be before the track season is
! over. Woolley went to San Jose
' State for two years, and then was j
; out of track for a full season of !
competition. He has been timed in i
t :15.8 in the highs, and probably has ,
! run faster races but won't admit it. !
After carefully waiting on old
j age, youth shall now be served.
Two sophomores, Dave Packard and j
, Gus Meier, who finished one-two
| in both hurdle races in last year's i
1 Little Big Meet, promise future if
! not present stardom.
Packard Will Run
1 Packard, last year's freshman
track and basketball captains and
: this year's varsity basketball cen
j ter, recorded : 15.5 in the highs and \
j about 25 in the lows. He incidentally
high-jumps and throws the discus,
j Packard will be out for track j
I v hen the cage season ends. He has j
| speed and size in abundance, and
if it turns out that he has enough
i speed to lug around his size, he
! should be as good a hurdler as the
1 coast can boast.
Meier was but 3-10 second be
; hind his captain in the highs and
' about as close in the lows. Gus has j
! been out for track since way back !
last October, and he is at present ;
running just behind Herbert in the |
lows and just behind Brugman in I
the highs. Meier seems to have ,
' picked up speed since last spring
and if so ... . but this story, like
Stanford's hurdling situation, is too
full of "ifs" already.
