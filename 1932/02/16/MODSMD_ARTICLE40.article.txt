# Redshirt Nine Prepares For Return Santa Clara Tilt
## STANFORD BATMEN HOPE TO REPEAT WIN OVER BRONCS Wolter Will Start Same Team Tomorrow As Last Saturday 
### Bob Wade 
Having come through IHo first
g; me of the season without too
much trouble, Coach Harry Wol
ter's baseball team took a light
workout yesterday in preparation
lor the second Santa Clara contest
tc morrow afternoon on their field.
The only thing tlr.it made the bat
tle lii,st Saturday seem hard was the
inability of the Rudshirts to hit
when there were men on bases. On
tlu- other hand, the Santa Clara out
field robbed the Indians twice when
they appeared to have runs cinched.
Coach Walter used his substitu
tions to the best possible effect when
hi put in Hearn and Miles to bat
for Massey and Caddel in the sev
(nth. With the f ore tied at 2—all,
and two on the bases, it looked like
a case, of "now or never. Hearn
came through with a nice bunt that
advanced the men to second and
third. Miles watched Burke throw a
couple of his fast balls over the
plate, and then planted one between
third and shortstop to score two
runs and cinch the game.
Miles Is Good.
If anything should happen to one
of the outfielders, Wolter would
probably insert Miles in the line-up
without very much hesitation. Any
one- who can hit a-. well as he has
so far, deserves at least a tryout.
Hearn is just beginning to get his
i'vj on the ball, but he will have to
start planting them over the fence
to beat out Fred Goodell, judging
by the way the latter was hitting
.11 the game Saturday.
Stanford made only two errors in
its first conference appearance, anel
neither of them amounteel to any
thing very serious, but they make
Hi 'ding averages look pretty weak.
Santa Clara was supposed to have
six pitchers, all of them able to start
the game; but judging by ;he way
"the great" Mails left Burke in the
contest when Stanford kept nicking
him for hits inning after inning, it
look- as if the Broncos have Larry
Burke and five other pitchers.
Brones Are Next
The Indians play the Broncs
again tomorrow, Saint Mary's Sat
urclay and the following Wednes
day, and then come back to linish
up the Santa Clara : ■ ries. After that
the third Saint game is the last
before th< Southern trip during the
spi ing vacation.
Coach Wolter will probably start
the same team tomorrow that he
used Saturday. He is trying to get
