# YEARLING BASEBALL SQUAD HOLDS STIFF BATTING PRACTICE
## 
### 
TV strengthen a weak batting!
, iifjcup, Coach Murray Cuddeback
! held a brisk batting practice for the \
> Stanford freshman baseball squad |
j yesterday afternoon. As last Satur- !
I clay's game with Alameda displayed i
a decided lack of surety in the frosh '
i batsmen, Cuddeback spent the en- '
tire workout period in correcting
the players' batting stances and ;
i brushing up flaws in the general :
1 hitting line.
Before a battery of three pitchers, i
the entire lineup tested batting eyes j
while Cuddeback stood by and com
â–  merited on the slugging attempts of !
i tin squad. Carl Eitner, Fred Her- :
i inger, and A1 Semmelroth, babe j
I hurlers, limbered up their chucking !
: arms in pitching to the batsmen, j
! The squad did not go through the j
i regular fielding practice although |
the outfielders kept the basemen j
warmed up during the workout with j
a peppering of snagged balls. The
' batters were more at ease before
; their own moundsmen than before j
j the visiting hurlers of last Saturday
j and as a result pounded the balls
all over the lot with an improved
' ability at placing the horsehide.
Two new players joined the ranks
.of the frosh outfit. A1 Jurs and
j Marvy Kahn appeared for the first i
i time as applicants for berths in the
! outfield.
When he won the National Ama
teur featherweight championship in
1927, Battling Bat tali no knocked out
four men in less than eight minutes.
