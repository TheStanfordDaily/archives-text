# NO NOISE; NO STUDY Library Radiators Hotcha DROPPING BOTTLES AID
## 
### 
Believe it or not, the much-ma
ligned radiators in the Library are
no hindrance to study; indeed, they
are a positive aid. When they begin
tc chortle with glee or whatever
emotion radiators feel that makes
them act that way, that is the very
time you concentrate best.
Likewise, that Sequoia rat race
ard the bottles dropping in the En
cina bullpen are just the things to
boost your grades. If you have a
mid-quarter tomorrow, a wrestling
match next door to your room in
the Union will enable you to come
through with flying colors.
The reason for all this is that it
is impossible to study in a sound
proof room, according to Professor
Farnsworth of the psychology de
partment. It seems that when you
tre stimulated to study, other .stim
uli merge with the studying stimu
lus and make it stronger so that you
concentrate better.
