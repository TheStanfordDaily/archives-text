CONSIDER THE CASE of the'
Biuins.
They got away to a bad start by j
dropping two fast gant'es to Stan
ford—great games for Stanford to
win, but tough ones for the Works
team to lose. You will remember i
that only superior foul shooting won!
for the Indians —the Bruins sank one j
more field goal than did Stanford
during the engagement.
California was lucky to take two
from the Bruins the next week, one
requiring an extra period to decide. 1
Four straight losses — losses
that might have been as many
wins had the breaks gone the
other way.
Then Works' famous bit of strat
egy —allowing the Trojans to stall •
for 16 minutes so two of his injured |
players wouldn't be worn out ■ —
brought the U.C.L.A. quintet its first ■
victory, a soul-satisfying one which
gave the Barry staffers their first
setback of the season. Two wins
over Stanford, and the Bruins were
established as championship eon
te nders.
WITH HOPES of both teams de
pending on taking two straight
games, the Southern Branch and
the Berkeley parent institution met
at Oakland the next week. It was
Nibs Price's outfit which turned the
trick —but only after two of the i
closest battles seen on the 1 coast
this year.
"Well," quoth the Bruins, if
we can't win. at least we can j
keep it in the family."
So they went hack to Los An
geles to tackle the Terrible Tro
jans—and again the Bruins tri
umphed to tie up the race be
tween California and U.S.C.
Today the U.C.L.A. ream claims
the distinction of being the only
conference quintet to have defeated
the Trojans twico—and it's even
money that it will be three times
by next Saturday night.
Yet that same Bruin five is deep
down in the percentage column with
a record far short of its real
strength.
IT SEEMS that Southern Cali
fornia is not to be handed the divi
sion title on a silver platter in the
event of a tie with U.C. In the past
it has been the custom to decide lies
m favor of the team which defeated
the other in the regular series, but
California has declared it shall not '

be so this year.
Of course, if U.C.L.A. should
crack through with still another
win over the Trojans I his week,
the Bears will have a clear
claim to the title anyway, as
tin re is hardly a chance that the
crippled Stanford team will he
able to stop the Berkeley five
in the final game of the B;g
Series here.
But if there is a tie, Bears anc
Trojans will meet again in a play
off series, the scene of battle to be
decided by the flip of a coin.
And WHAT a series that
would be!* —L.M.C.

the Bears will have a clear
claim to the title anyway, as
tin re is hardly a chance that the
crippled Stanford team will he
able to stop the Berkeley five
in the final game of the B;g
Series here.
But if there is a tie, Bears anc
Trojans will meet again in a play
off series, the scene of battle to be
decided by the flip of a coin.
And WHAT a series that
would be!* —L.M.C.
CONSIDER THE CASE of the'
Biuins.
They got away to a bad start by j
dropping two fast gant'es to Stan
ford—great games for Stanford to
win, but tough ones for the Works
team to lose. You will remember i
that only superior foul shooting won!
for the Indians —the Bruins sank one j
more field goal than did Stanford
during the engagement.
California was lucky to take two
from the Bruins the next week, one
requiring an extra period to decide. 1
Four straight losses — losses
that might have been as many
wins had the breaks gone the
other way.
Then Works' famous bit of strat
egy —allowing the Trojans to stall •
for 16 minutes so two of his injured |
players wouldn't be worn out ■ —
brought the U.C.L.A. quintet its first ■
victory, a soul-satisfying one which
gave the Barry staffers their first
setback of the season. Two wins
over Stanford, and the Bruins were
established as championship eon
te nders.
WITH HOPES of both teams de
pending on taking two straight
games, the Southern Branch and
the Berkeley parent institution met
at Oakland the next week. It was
Nibs Price's outfit which turned the
trick —but only after two of the i
closest battles seen on the 1 coast
this year.
"Well," quoth the Bruins, if
we can't win. at least we can j
keep it in the family."
So they went hack to Los An
geles to tackle the Terrible Tro
jans—and again the Bruins tri
umphed to tie up the race be
tween California and U.S.C.
Today the U.C.L.A. ream claims
the distinction of being the only
conference quintet to have defeated
the Trojans twico—and it's even
money that it will be three times
by next Saturday night.
Yet that same Bruin five is deep
down in the percentage column with
a record far short of its real
strength.
IT SEEMS that Southern Cali
fornia is not to be handed the divi
sion title on a silver platter in the
event of a tie with U.C. In the past
it has been the custom to decide lies
m favor of the team which defeated
the other in the regular series, but
California has declared it shall not '

be so this year.
Of course, if U.C.L.A. should
crack through with still another
win over the Trojans I his week,
the Bears will have a clear
claim to the title anyway, as
tin re is hardly a chance that the
crippled Stanford team will he
