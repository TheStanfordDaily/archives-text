# FARM FROSH HOPE TO TAKE BEARS IN THIRD U.C. FRACAS
## Stanford Yearlings, Beaten Twice, In Final Spurt To Win Saturday 
### Albert Guerard 
The annual Freshman-Varsity
game for the University Basket
ball Championship will he
played this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock in the Pavilion. Last
year the varsity won 12-15 in a
game that was much closer than
the score would indicate. Regu
lation rules and full-time
periods will prevail. Admission
is free.

It's all over now but the shout
ing, with the California freshmen
in undisputed possession of the an
nual Little Big Series, but the
Stanford yearlings, still unwilling to
quit, are in their last week of prac
tise of the 1932 season, looking for
ward to a victory over the Bear
Cubs Saturday night in the third
game of the season between the two
teams.
Weave Used
The odds were just too long for
Coach Vance Fawcett's ganu five
Saturday night. The 40-20 victory
was a foregone conclusion, but with
all due respect to the height of the
Beikeley team, and the excellent
shooting of Dave Meek, Bill Mor
gans, and Bill Mackey, the Indians
looked like a better-coached team
ir the first half of Saturday's fray.
Tin Californians' persisted in using
the antique "grapevine weave"
which would have gone to pieces
against a team of fairly tall men.
it isn't hard to pick out the star
of Saturday night's contest.
Tim Kelly, Lory Rothert, tho
Stanford guards, and all of the
Californians played fine games, but
Henry Coiner, forward, was the one
Indian player who refused to let
down during the darkest moments
of the second half. He meant as
much to the fresmen as Tommy
Cordry did to the varsity.
Compilation of a city directory
for New York is expected to give
about 100,000 working days to the
unemployed.
