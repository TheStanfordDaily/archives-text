# CARD BASKETBALL SQUAD TAKES PRACTICE HOLIDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's crippled basketball |
squad did not report to practice last
night, not because it was unneces
sary, but probably duo to the fact
that Coach John Bunn thinks ihe
boys are a little stale.
Saturdays iOss to the Hears was
the eighth straight for the* Indians
and forced them into the cellar for ,
good, the U.C.L.A. Bruins having
won another game from the once
league-leading Trojans.
With no hope that the unhealthy
condition of the Cards will be im
proved for the final California game '
here next Saturday except that A!
Norgard may return to the lineup,
there is little chance that the In
dians can do anything to stop an
other basket-sinking attack by Nibs
Price's Californians.
The Bears are probably at a peak
that may carry them successfully
through a play-off series with
Southern California to decide the
southern division championship. But
if U.C.L.A. comes through again for !
a third upset over Southern Cali- |
fornia next Saturday, the Bears may
bo saved the trouble, provided, of
course, they defeat Stanford again.
The Bruins, however, will find the
Terrible Trojans much harder to
take this week since ihey will be
making their "last stand" for the
title, just as California was last week
against Stanford. The Uclans have
apparently had the breaks as both
of their games with ihe Trojans
were- won by close margins gained
only in the last few minutes of play.
Just what Coach John Bonn's
plans are for the final game here
this week cannot be said, but it is
quite likely he will drill his men in
a couple of plenty tough scrimmages

| today and tymorrow and ease off
with light sessions on Thursday and
Friday.
Packard at center to control the>
tip-off, Meade and Cordry as for
wards, and Cosgrove and Norgard
at the guard positions is the liki-ly
wr.) the boys will line up at scrim
mage.
