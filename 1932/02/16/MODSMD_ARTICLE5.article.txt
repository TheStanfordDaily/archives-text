## 
### 

Nippon High Command rushes more heavy-armed well-equipped
infantry into China today as 75,000 Chinese and Japanese soldiers
wait for (he zero-hour of (lie hip Jap drive. Silhouetted against the
Oriental sky, with their flap waving, this column is typical of Jap
troops now in Shanghai. Twenty-five thousand men arc now in the

shell-swept city with more reinforcements en route from mobiliza
tion centcrs in the Island Empire. Fifty thousand Chinese wait
stubbornly in their battered trenches along the Whang Poo. United
States authorities urge all Americans in interior cities to retreat
within the walls of Shanghai's International Settlement.
