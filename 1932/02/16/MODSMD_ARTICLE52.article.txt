Burleigh Grimes, hero of the 1931 world series when he checked
the Philadelphia Athletics twice for the St. Louis Cardinals, is
shown signing a one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs, to whom
he was traded in the deal that sent Hack Wilson to the Cards on
the first leg of his journey to Brooklyn. President William L.
Vewck (left) got Grimes' signature.
