# DRASTIC FOOTBALL RULE REVISION CAUSES STORM
## 
### 
T HE football rules committee has been at it again.
! That august body, in an attempt to curb the mounting injury toll,
yesterday announced the most drastic rule chances since the inception
, of the forward pass. Six rules, which it is believed will alter the grid
; game in many respects, were written into the books by the committee
I in session at Hanover, New Hampshire. A storm of protest has greeted
; several of the changes, while others have met with approval.
"They went too far," Coach Pop Warner declared last night, ''and still
1 haven't accomplished all they have set out to. Several of the changes
• "wili help, however."

Warner Approves
Warner particularly approved of j
the rule prohibiting use of the hands i
• by > defensive linesmen. "This is ai
fine move," he said, "although the j
attached penalty of disqualification:
, and half the distance to the goal line j
is too severe. Officials will hesitate i
to enforce it."
It was this rule, however, to j
which other Bay Region coaches ob- i
jected most strenuously.
"It will take the heart out of the
defense," declared Coach Bill In- !
gram of California. "It brings the |
, game back to soldiering around— !
back to the 1890 style again."
"It's crazy," was Slip Madigan's;
comment. "It's instinctive to use
your hands."
Spud Lewis, newly appointed San j
Francisco University coach, heartily j
concurred with Warner.
Opinions Varied
Opinions varied on the other j
i changes as follows:
Kickoff rule—Most coaches were ;
| hike-warm on the proposition, but
believed it would aid in preventing
injuries. Warner believed every
body would punt.
Substitution rule — General ap
proval. Warner was very much in
favor of it.
Flying block or tackle rule—Gen
eral disapproval, as it would take
; many of the thrills from the game,
i Warner was opposed.
Dead ball rule—Some believed it
! would eliminate "piling up," while
others were opposed. Warner de
| c'.ared the committee should have i
: been more specific in ruling against j
! kneeing, rather than making such
a drastic general ruling.
Equipment rule—Doubt was ex
: pressed as to its value by some, but ;
, g< neral opinion was that it would j
I aid in minimizing injuries,
j Warner, together with other j
coaches, has been asked to remit j
suggestions to the board for rule I
: revision. For the most part Warner's
I suggestions were followed closely. 1
