# CARDS IMPROVE IN PREPARATION FOR BEAR TILT
## Card Hoop Men Look Good In Streaks; Erratic Play Marks Tilt COSGROVE TO FACE U.C. Bears Prepare; Bruins May Crash U.S.C. Again 
### Day Dorland 
With the Card varsity basketeers'
improved showing last night against
the freshmen, Coach John Bunn will
continue to put them through their
paces in preparation for the final
contest of the Big Series with Cali
fornia here Saturday.
Bunn declared that his line-up for
Saturday's tussle was still in ques
tion, but Norgard's reappearance in
one guard post is probably perman
ent. Norgard had been forced to the
bench all last week with a sprained
ankle, but it looks as though his

General admission tickets for
the third and final California-
Stanford basketball game will go
on sale this morning at 9 o'clock
in the B.A.C. office. Ducats may
be purchased for one dollar each.
The game will be held in the
Pavilion Saturday night at 8
o'clock.

sliver-picking days are over. He
played a strong defensive game
against the frosh, and although he
seemed to favor the bad leg a trifle,
is likely to round into top form in
time for the opening whistle.
Cosgrove in
Jack Cosgrove opened fire against
the babes in a guard position, but
was shifted back to his familiar for
ward stand when Baker replaced
Meade. His aggressive game in that
department may give him the start
ing call over Meade when the In
dians entertain the Bears. Next to
Cordry, as in last week's fracas at
Oakland, Cosgrove led the Cardinal
offense, and repeatedly wormed his
way under the basket to ring the
set-ups.
His running mate, Cordry, seem
ingly unaware that the opponents
were the freshmen, enjoyed his
usual fiery game. Cosgrove and
Cordry seem to develop the fastest
and smoothest floor play when
working together, and Bunn's se
lections will probably find these
two paired at the forward positions.
Packard Has Edge
Packard, due to his ability to con
trol the tip-off, remains a slight
favorite over Hancock and Doub in
the race for the pivot job.
The other defense post is disputed
by Baker, Edelen, and Tod, with
Baker maintaining the lead by a
nose. It will be up to one of the
three to baffle the Bear sharp
shooters when the latter shake out
their scoring attack.
While the Indians are planning
an upset, the California squad is
concentrating all efforts in view of
routing the Farm defenders. An
other win for the Boars will assure
them at least a tie for the southern
division championship. If the U.C.
L.A. Bruins come through to repeat
their sensational string of upsets
over the Trojans, they will throw
the loop title to their â–  northern
kinsmen.
