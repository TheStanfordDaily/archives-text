# FRENCH SENATE LAUGHS LAVAL OUT OF OFFICE
## Premier's Share In Passing Woman Suffrage Seen As Defeat Cause 
### 
PARIS, Feb. 16. (TP)â€”The Laval
government resigned tonight after
a laughing and shouting Senate had
defeated it by twenty-three votes,
but the Cabinet crisis was not ex
pected to affect in any way the
I rench foreign policy, especially in
legard to disarmament and repara
tions.
The Senate turned down a vote
cf confidence 157 to 134. The Pre
mier had asked that questions con
cerning general policy be postponed
until February 19 in order that
there might be no interference with
important negotiations now being
carried on at the disarmament con
ference in Geneva. He made the re
quest a question of confidence.
Seek Successor
President Paul Doumer began
consultations tonight in an effort to
bring a new government into being
at the earliest possible moment.
The Senate's action was attributed
to left wing discontent with what
critics contended was M. Laval's
hidden hand in the passage of suf
frage for women in chamber elec
tions.
Mention Tardieu
Displeasure over the ousting of
Aristide Briand from the foreign of
fice also played a part. And at the
bottom of the opposition was dis
satisfaction with the results of M.
Laval's trip to Washington based
on the fact that he failed to reach
an agreement with the United States
providing for reduction in war debts.
The resignation left the French
delegation at Geneva stranded. That
delegation is headed by Andre Tar
dieu, minister of war. Tardieu was
mentioned tonight as a probable
successor to M. Laval. Others named
were Senator Joseph Paul-Boncoua,
one of the principal members of the
Geneva delegation, and Senators
Louis Barthou and Albert Sarraut.
