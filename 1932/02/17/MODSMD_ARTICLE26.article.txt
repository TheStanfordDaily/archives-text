# A 						NEW CROP OF BIG SHOTS
## 
### 
Al last the tension caused by the great agitation over
campus ejections is released and this university, stirred to
its very roots by political fervor, can settle back to its nor
mal course of life.
Fortunately, for the nerves of all concerned, only two
revotes were necessary to elect the incumbents for the
coming term, the election for the president of the sopho
more class being rcheld later because of a lie.
The great interest in politics that swept over the Farm is
easily apparent when it is observed that nearly one-fifth of
the eligible voters cast their ballots in yesterday's revote.
Incidentally, only class positions were voted on yesterday,
all of the A.S.S.I', offices being tilled in the first election.
It also should be pointed out that two class positions were
tilled at the time, something almost unheard of in Stanford
politics.
Those who have served so hard and so well as class
oflicers during the past term can at last turn over their
arduous duties to their successors and draw that pleasant
sigh of relief that conies with the knowledge of a diflieult
task well done.
A new crop of luminaries has ascended the heights and
some fraternities and sororities can revel in the thought
that at last one of their number is a campus big-shot. A
fraternity man will nudge you and, pointing at a corded
figure, will exclaim with great glee, "That's Brother Zilch,
lie's our class secretary." Perhaps some co-ed will haul
you up to the house for the pleasure of meeting Sister
(ilutz, who has won the important position of class vice
president.
And the successful candidates! How proud and impor
tant they must feel when they stroll along the Quad know
ing that ali eyes are upon them, that they at last actually
amount to something on the campus, that their college ca
reers are s, cessful. Not even the thought of till the work
and responsibility that they assumed when they took otlice
can quench their exuberant spirits aroused by the knowl
edge Unit they are campus leaders.
The Daily goes its way with its head bowed by the
knowledge that when more worthless offices are created,
A.S.S.F. will create them.
