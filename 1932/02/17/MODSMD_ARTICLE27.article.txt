# AW, NUTS!

The peanut, while not considered a necessity of life,
nevertheless holds that certain something which shares its
victims as does dope. Having taken one, the luckless inno
cent cannot hut continue to munch peanuts long after he is
fully aware that he doesn't want any more.
In view of this unfortunate grip that these vermin hold)
on the average paid customer who frequents sports events
in the Pavilion, il seems that the least that could he done
lo alleviate their suffering would he to make available
peanuts that are in some degree palatable.
The peanuts sold under the cover of a harmless-appear
ing paper sack to unsuspecting fans at the last two home
basketball games were bad; those offered at the fights last
Thursday night were horrible.
Saturday night in the Pavilion Stanford will meet Cali
fornia i.n a game of basketball. The peanut vendor will be
there as usual lo lure the weak-willed, and many will fall
into his clutches. In the cause of suffering humanity, can
he not be considerate enough to sell peanuts of at least
average quality?
