I)!'. I Joiner Leroy Shantz, along with the faculties of the
various colleges of this I'niversity, deserves much com
inendation and appreciation ;il tlie hands of students of the
I'niversity and the people of the State of Arizona. The
voluntary action of the faculty of the University in taking
a salary cut in ord< r to provide a fund for emergency relief
of Arizona students who lind themselves in financial straits,
plus the wise and careful administration of this and other
funds by the t 'diversity president constitute one of the most
outstanding examples of unselfish service to humanity and
of intelligent relief work that lias come to our notice. Cer
tainly all these men and women should receive our hearty
appreciation. Arizona Wildcat.
