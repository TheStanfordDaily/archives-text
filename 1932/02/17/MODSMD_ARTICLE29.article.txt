# BULL SESSION
## THE 						POOR PHI BETE 
### 
One of the most maligned and
j beaten creatures on the modern
' campus is the Phi Bete. Taunted
j and scorned at every turn—he is
i often forced to sit in a corner with
nothing to do but twirl his key; bfat
ii he has one of the large models.
| that usually offers his ample sport.
There are several reasons why Phi
Beta Kappa is not exactly placed
] on a pedestal and worshipped by
' the students. There are good and
j not so good reasons why the stu
j dent who dangles a shining expanse
j of square gold on his chest is not
j the apex of campus admiration.
In the first place, studying is un
, natural and decidedly not a youth
! i'ul activity. It is meant for those
! who no longer have exuberant blood
! zipping through the still soft ar
i teries. Consequently, the student
I body may marvel and wonder at
j tnese strange creatures, the Phi
I Betes, for their unusual fortitude;
i bur they cannot admire or honor
; them for the simple reason that
, they seem to be so unnatural. Of
: course, studying is the purpose of
the university, that is theory; and
in practice, is not taken too seri-
The argument that Phi Betes suf
) fer various uncomplimentary epi
( thets at the hands of the students
, fcr the same reason that the fox
cried, "Sour Grapes," is not well
; founded. If jealousy were the cause,
why is it that the Block "S" is not
scorned? Many desire, but few get
: it. The answer is that athletics is

| normal; and intellectual activity is
not. Can anybody imagine some
j sweet young thing draping herself
ever the shoulders suffering from
j the PBK curve, and whispering,
| "What did you make your key in—
| organic chem or biological Sciences?"
Another cause — perhaps, more
j noticeable—for the attitude toward
America's oldest fraternity is the
fact that people expect great intel
ligence from all Phi Betes. That is
| unfortunate for the purpose of the
| society is to reward high grades and
not intellectual superiority. The
Key represents ability to pass
exams, and not intellectual curiosity.
| And anyone who has been around
for a few quarters knows that while
| some brains are needed to "crack"
i the quizzes—intensive studying and
memorizing is of much greater
| value.
Thus, the quality that is most
; prevalent and most conspicuous in
1 Phi Beta Kappa is endurance—per
) severance—ability to dig—dig until
the finger-bones scrape the letters
ofl the typewriter keys. Unusual in
telligence is not the prime cliarac
: teristic; and those who expect it
are necessarily disappointed.
In the big Life after college, the
| Flu Betes do not necessarily rise
! to the top, because then the bread
motive serves to whip people who
j in college were lazy. Secondly, the
| qualities that make for good schol
arship do not necessarily spell suc
' ce.ss; but that should be no slam at
Phi Beta Kappa—it is a scholarship
i society, not a success association.

In the first place, studying is un

I body may marvel and wonder at

in practice, is not taken too seri-
The argument that Phi Betes suf

why is it that the Block "S" is not

not. Can anybody imagine some

Another cause — perhaps, more

Thus, the quality that is most

are necessarily disappointed.
In the big Life after college, the
