THE SILVEIf CORD—AI (lie Palo
Alio Community Theatre.
Sidney Coe Howard's play of mis
used mother love, "The Silver
Cord," is an extremely good one if
the Palo Alto Community Theatre
production of it was not.
The play, after an introductory
act, resolves itself into a desperate
duel between a hypocritical and
all-enveloping mother and the wife
of one of her sons.
The wife's character, as drawn by
Howard, is sympathetic, that of Mrs.
Phelps the opposite. Had Corinne
E'kins' Christina been more suc
cessfully appealing, Dr. Margery
Bailey's Mrs. Phelps might have
been correspondingly less sympa
thetic than it was, despite the char
acter's horrible, smooth schemings.
Unfortunately Miss Elkins was
incapable; unable, apparently, to
portray Christina physically, wheth
er she visioned her mentally or not.
Her Christina, partly because of an
ignominious trace of accent and a
vcice which became raucous as it
ascended, was unpleasant and al
most repulsive; never keen and
clear, but dull. The actress defied
the lines of the play.
Dr. Bailey caricatured the mother
somewhat, possibly inadvertently
gaining sympathy for her in that
satiric diversion; Peg Converse in a
small role was fine until a difficult
emotional scene where, without
support, her tears were not quite
real. Richard Ogg, cast better than
he has been in the past and using
fewer false A's than usual, posed
badiy. He read his lines adequately
but in physical movement often be
lied them and destroyed their effect.
Robert Brauns, as the younger
.':on, was either miscast or overly
emotional. He made the man an ap
pealing small boy instead of a hope
lessly weak, selfish, and slightly
] akish young cad. Brauns had po
tentialities but was here too sympa
thetic, particularly in a fine first
ac! scene which was Young Woolley
instead of Silver Cord.

I The play being extremely wordy j
i .should have been directed at swifter I
tempo. The climaxes could have j
i been built far higher and more em- ;
phatically. And a less intimate tone j
of voice, particularly in the first act, |
would have been an infinite relief j
!to our belated and consequently i
misplaced ears.
The Community Theatre had a j
fine opportunity with an actress of |
unusual ability to prove itself the- I
atrically capable. Instead it pro- j
duced the depressing spectacle of a ,
play carried by one character and I
dragging badly when that character i
was not on stage. Even Dr. Bailey's |
fascinating Mrs. Phelps, made ex- 1
j tremely real by effective use of
I nuance and inimitable employment'
of detail, could not preserve alten- !
tion of the auditors through two and j
a half long hours. •—J.S.S.
