# The 						Windjammer
## 
### 
Poor old Windjammer is in a bad
spot, what with dodging water bags
aimed at us by Men's Council, and
well-aimed missives of this-and
that variety from well-known DCs
j and Keppas. On top of that, we had
| just developed an idea for some
thing different in the colyuni, being
! a new campaign for a Phi Delt sub
marine crew to take over the busi
| ness of showing visitors around the
j campus and to Hoover's home, at a
i quarter per dive, or something like
j that. And now the sun seems to
have come' out of hibernation, and
1 we can't even think of anything ex
j cppt sunning and gazing and being
] dazed and what's the use anyhow?
II seems that we're being offered
j something new in the way of en-
I tfcrtainment, at least we haven't
heard about a verse-speaking choir
' for about a year, now. We might
nominate some highlights of our
j own ,who might be induced to go
1 into competition with the visitors,
j tonight. Professor Hulme could hold
| his own with any tenor section, and
there's always a yell-leader or two
just more than anxious to liven up
lan enthusiastic group with vocal
j selections.
Now that Dr. Bailey has given
a model performance to show
the work! what an amateur ac
tress should be at her best, we're
beginning to worry about ad
mittance to any more of her
i classes. Membership in one of
them has always been at a high
premium, but what if she sud
! denly decided that you had to
be able to perform Shakespeare
as well as understand it (??)
before you got a passing grade?
Overheard in the Theta dining-
I room:
"Say, that fellow you were out
| with last night looked like a flat
t tire to me."
"Oh, I'm just using him for a
I spare, you know."

We understand that a mora
torium is a place where dead
bones and other relics are kept,
i Here at Stcenford. it's called a
! Freshman Bible. Nothing over
three syllables will do.

II seems that we're being offered
j something new in the way of en-
I tfcrtainment, at least we haven't
heard about a verse-speaking choir
' for about a year, now. We might
nominate some highlights of our
j own ,who might be induced to go
1 into competition with the visitors,
j tonight. Professor Hulme could hold

there's always a yell-leader or two
just more than anxious to liven up
lan enthusiastic group with vocal
j selections.
Now that Dr. Bailey has given
a model performance to show
the work! what an amateur ac
tress should be at her best, we're
beginning to worry about ad
mittance to any more of her
i classes. Membership in one of
them has always been at a high
premium, but what if she sud
! denly decided that you had to
be able to perform Shakespeare
as well as understand it (??)
before you got a passing grade?
Overheard in the Theta dining-
I room:

t tire to me."

Poor old Windjammer is in a bad
spot, what with dodging water bags
aimed at us by Men's Council, and
well-aimed missives of this-and
that variety from well-known DCs
j and Keppas. On top of that, we had
| just developed an idea for some
thing different in the colyuni, being
! a new campaign for a Phi Delt sub
marine crew to take over the busi
| ness of showing visitors around the
j campus and to Hoover's home, at a
i quarter per dive, or something like
j that. And now the sun seems to
