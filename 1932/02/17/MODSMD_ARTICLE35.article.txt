# Freshman Hoopsters Give Varsity Tough Battle
## YEARLINGS LOSE 42-23; CUB FROSH TILT CALLED OFF Cosgrove Looks Good; May Replace Meade Against Bears Saturday 
### Albert Guerard 
The Stanford varsity had the scare
o! its life yesterday afternoon.
C ach John Bunn started his big'
gi:ns: Doub, Cordry, Meade, Nor
i .<rd, and Cosgrove against Vance
Fawcett's yeariings in the annual
V; rsity-Frcshman game lor the
University championship; saw them
boost an early 10-1 lead to 18-6 by
lu 11-time, and then watched a fight
ing, clean-passing frosh five play
their best ball of the year to cut
the lead to 21-19 with eleven min
utes to go, as Tom Sales controlled
tiie tip-off from John Hancock.
At this point, Dave Packard en
tered the game and his height
proved too much for the badly tir
ing frosh team. In the last ten min
utes the varsity ran up twenty-one
points to 4 for the freshmen, and
enjoyed a 42-23 advantage at the
final whistle.
Game Close
The game was much closer than
the score would indicate. The varsity
had .'in edge in the first and fourth
quarters, but in the second and
third periods they were no match
for the fast-moving freshmen. It
was the height of Jack Cosgrove,
who scored eighteen points, and
Dave Packard, who enabled the
varsity to gain control of the ball in
the closing minutes of the game, that
uccided the issue.
Advantage in Height
Fairly short men, like Cordry and
Palmer, were unable to do much
against the yearling guards, but the
t; Her members of the squad had a
field day. Although Packard scored
only five points, he was half of the
varsity offense because of his abil
i y to get the tip-off and take the
ball off the backboard.
Cosgrove was easily the outstand
ing man on the floor. He started the
fciime at guard, but soon went up
to forward, and his play at that
position may earn him the nod over
Meade lor .a shot at forward against
California Saturday.
Cancel Frosh Game
The Coiner twins, Wally Crowe,
Jim Trompas, Tom Sales, Joe Butte,
Jim Savage, and Gordon Mallatratt
all turned in good games.. Lory
fiothert was hurt early in the game,
and his loss undoubtedly weakened
the yearlings.
The third game of the Little Big
Series has been cancelled, it was
announced yesterday. California has
aiready won the two games neces
sary for a series victory. The Rose
villc High game, originally sched
uled for Frid ay, will probably be
moved up to Saturday, as a pre
liminary to the Stanford-Bear var
sity struggle, and will officially close
the frosh season.
