# CARDINAL POLOISTS TO TACKLE ATHENS CLUB IN STIFF TILT
## 
### 
I
In meeting the Athens Club water I
poloists in Oakland at 8 o'clock to- j
night, the varsity seven will en- j
counter no "duck soup" outfit. I
While not as strong as the Olympic ;
Club team which defeated the Red
skins last I'iiday 9-6, the single fact
that the Athenians have trounced'
Calilornia by a 6-2 score is suffi
cient to set them up as at least a :
fairly strong aggregation.
Ogden Driggs, 1929 Cardinal swim
explain and star guard in 1928, 1929,
;nd 1930, will play for the Cluo.
Wiget, Clapp, and Booth will start
in the forward positions for the In
dians, with either Wiget or Zooth
sprinting, but the guards have not
as yet been named. Kink'ad, Woods,
Hai ris, Murrieta, and Throndson are I
in the running for these posts, with
the (hoice for goalie confined to ;
cither Linton or Knapp.
