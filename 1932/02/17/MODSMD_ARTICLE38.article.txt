# VARSITY RESERVE NINE BATTERS FROSH DIAMOND HOPES 7-4 IN HECTIC FRACAS
## 
### 
Errors and lagged playing doomed
the Stanford freshman baseball
' team to a 7 to 4 defeat before the
I battering of a reserve varsity ball
! couad in a practice game yesterday
afternoon. During periods of spurts,
| the frosh nine played heads-up ball,
I but the lack of experience caused a
[general state of disorder in the
i ranks of the babes when the varsity
! went on one of its numerous pound
j ing sprees.
| After retiring the varsity reserves
in short order during the first in
ning, Carl Eitner, side-arm mounds
! man for the frosh, opened the scor
i ing business with a run. The babes
iived in a state of errors and erratic

play and allowed their big brothers
to tally three runs, unearned for the
most part, during frolics of bag
stealing and base-hitting.
After playing steady hall during
1 the third inning, the frosh erred in
' the fourth, and the varsity men
| scored two more runs. Again in the
next frame the big brothers repeat
ed the same performance. When the
reserves had finished their scoring
sprees in both the fourth and fifth
innings, the frosh went into action
in the batting line and AI Semmel
roth, Charlie Emerick, and Jim
i Woolley crossed the plate to add
thiee more runs for the babes. The
hosh blanked the reserves in the
, final frame.
