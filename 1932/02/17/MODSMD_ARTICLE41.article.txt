### 
With the second conference gam
|of the season scheduled for thi
I Santa Clara field this afternoon a
3:30 o'clock. Coach Harry Wolte
last night decided to start the sam
team that opened last Saturday"
: contest.
This means that the Indian bat
, tery will be Caddel and Masse>
; with Goodell on first, Philippi hold
j ing down second base, Trautman a
i third, Delmas at short, and Gold
1 mann, Rintala, and Campbell in thi
I outfield
Ditches Mar Field
If this combination fails to piL
up the necessary lead, Wolter ha
Estes and Livermore as a reserve
battery and Miles for the outfield
The substitutes pulled the ball 1
out of the fire Saturday and the;
may have to do it again.
Santa Clara has a field that pre
i sents many tough problems to thi
visiting team. The drainage sys
|tem, which includes a ditch in righ
1 field and another along the left fieh
j foul-line, must have been con
Istructed to take care of the secon<
| Flood.
Fouls Costly
i Out in center field, the power
! that be erected a grandstand, am
; although a nice long drive from tin
piate, a ball that seeks shelter unde
its protecting bulk is good for onl;
two bases. As if to compensate tin
enraged victims of this ruling, ther
is nothing to impede the progres:
| of the spheroid once it escapes thi
[ clutches of the left-fielder excep
inertia.
However, the infield on the Broni
diamond is usually in A-l condition
And in addition to this there is ai
; old Spanish custom in vogue tha
1 always gives the spectators a goo<
| laugh. Out behind the backstop al
the youngsters in the neighborhooc
line up and wait for a foul ball
Once captured, the luckless pill i:
relayed from one to another until i
reaches the last man. This indi
vidua), undoubtedly chosen for hi:
speed when frightened, makes j
bee-line for parts unknown. In thi
: manner Santa Clara lays the foun
dation for future 60-yard dashes be
fore the shrieking multitudes.
Announcement has been made o
the discovery of many gold Inct
