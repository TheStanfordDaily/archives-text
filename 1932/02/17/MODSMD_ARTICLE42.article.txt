r STANFORD VS. WEST POINT!
i The undefeated Indians, with a
; record of six straight victories, vs.
I the sensational service school team!
But there will be no crowds to
cheer, no bands to play thrilling
! | marches, no eadcts to execute coior
i ful figures on the field. It is not
I football, but rifle competition, which
J brings the two institutions together
; this time.
Did we say together? Not ex
actly, because it is a mail-order
match, with each team mailing
its score to the other. The bat
tle is now at its height, and rc
-1 suits will be announced as soon
as scores can be compared.

j already downed Ohio State, Rose

k i gies in similar matches. They face
J theii greatest obstacles this week,

j CHARLIE SEAVER i.s on the spot.

1 is hardly any questioning the fact

1 j Twiggs, on returning from Stan- i
ford's unsuccessful invasion of
the Monterey peninsula. "But

' | he lost out."
With the approach of the inter

1 finds himself at a disadvantage be

* frosh football and Gray basketball.

'Ho shows promise in both of the ; a
latter sports—but not so much so

But, at that, you can hardly
blame the husky sophomore for
his other interests, lie probably .
figures that he has plenty of J
time to play golf later, and that
while he is in college he will
make the best of bis opportunity
to play major intercollegiate
..ports—an opportunity that will
never return.
There are golfing experts who i
have advised Charlie to lay off foot
ball. especially, on the grounds that
' it will not only hinder the develop
-1 ment of his links game now, but j
t v ill do it permanent harm. That,
I, .
i however, is open to question.
In any event, it's a tough choice. ,
