# STANFORD TO MEET SAN JOSE STATE IN W.A.A. BASKETBALL
## 
### 
Interclass intercollegiate basket
ball games will be played with Sail
Jose State Thursday, February 25,
following ihe decision made by the
W.A.A. Board last night. San Jose
is a new opponent for Stanford, as
no contests have been held with it
heretofore.
Although definite arrangements
have not been completed, upper di
visions games will probably be
played here, with lower classmen
meeting at San Jose, due to limited
facilities. Under these circum
stances San Jose Seniors will meet
Stanford Juniors, while Juniors
from San Jose will be matched with
Stanford Seniors. Straight interclass
games cannot be scheduled bccause
of the policy of the Athletic Con
ference of American College Women
which frowns upon intercollegiate
competition for women.
Arrangements are being made for
a banquet to be held in the Union
following the contests.
Announcement was made by Miss
Gertrude Hawley, Director of Roble
Gymnasium, that a soft, hall will be
used in baseball spring quarter, in
order that more women will turn
out for the sport.
PITTSBURGH, Feb. 16. (fP) -
