## Democrats Block Federal Relief, Oppose Hoover Loan Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16. (/P) -
The Senate tonight refused to es- i
j tablish the precedent of appropriat- 1
i in.u Government funds for direct re- 1
i lief to the unemployed.
The stand of President Hoover J
j against direct Federal aid was up- i
: held when the Senate rejected the i
iLa Follette-Costigan $750,000,000 \
| measure by a vote of 48 to 35. The
j vote came long after the usual time
â–  for adjournment.
Break Party Lines
Party lines went to pieces on the
i roll call which closed more than :
i two weeks of intense debate.
Twenty-one Democrats joined 27
Republicans in opposition after their
own substitute providing for Gov-
I eminent loans to States had been !
turned down. Fifteen Republicans
supported the bill. Previously half.;
< a dozen substitute and compromise
! plans for extending relief for the
Treasury had been turned down, as :
j, sponsors of Federal aid to the un- ;
. employed fought among themselves j
about the method of distribution.
Sponsor Substitute
Democrats who had sponsored \
, : loans to States instead of gifts gave
% i notice, however, that the struggle j
. was not over as they introduced :
( ! their $750,000,000 defeated substitute
I as a separate bill.
! The decision, regarded by both !
' sides as momentous, came shortly J
" | before 7 o'clock, after the Senate ]
j had debated all day long before 1
J I crowded galleries. In an eloquent
, last -minute appeal, Senator La Fol- >
" | lette (R., Wisconsin), one of the
* j sponsors of the bill, asked for its
s ' enactment. He said previous votes 1
1 had disclosed a recognition of the j
s ! need for Federal aid by a majority ;
" i of the Senate and asserted through- |
~ | out the long weeks of debate only |
1 three members had challenged it.
