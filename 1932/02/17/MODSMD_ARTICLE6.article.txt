ALBANY, N.Y., Feb. 16. (/P) —
Sitting as Chief Magistrate of the
State 01 New York, Governor
Franklin D. Roosevelt heard argu
ment today on charges that Sheriff
Thr.mas M. Farley of New York
City permitted gambling in his Tam
| many Club House, kept money not
rightfully his. and was otherwise
i unfitted to hold public office.
| "We charge," said Samuel Sea
: bury, chief counsel of the Hofstad
ter Legislative Committee, and the
one seeking to oust the Sheriff,
"that the Thomas M. Farley Asso
ciation was the resort of gunmen
; arid gangsters. I say if Farley did
that he is not the type of man to
be sheriff. It is just one circum
j stance to prove his disqualification."
Denies Gambling Charge
Siegfried Hartman, Farley's law-
I ycr, countered with the assertion
that the gambling charges were
based on \*hat he called valueless
police records.
Farley, called simply "Tom" by
his friends and "Tin Box Tom" by
his foes, was the target of a string
i of other charges.
He is accused of banking about
?:i9C.r»O3 between 1925 and last fall,
lan dthat he appropriated some of
the- interests on litigants' funds en
trusted to his care.
