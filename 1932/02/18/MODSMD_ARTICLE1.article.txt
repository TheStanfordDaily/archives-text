# BRONC DOUBLE PLAY IN NINTH BEATS INDIANS
## Judnich Poles Homer With Two Men On To Gain Four Run Lead FOURTH FRAME FATAL Cards Challenge Visitors In Seventh; Hot Rally Brings 4-3 Score 
### Boh Wade 
The bases loaded in the ninth j
with nobody out, a pop fly, a hit j
into a double-play, and Stanford J
dropped the second game of the I
season to the Santa Clara baseball ;
varsity yesterday on the Broncos' I
field.
Stanford faltered in the fourth in- ;
ning, when two errors put men 011
first and second, and Judnich poled
one of Caddel's offerings out of the
lot. Santa Clara increased the lead
to four, on a walk and a single, and !
then stood off the Indian challenge.
"Lucky Seventh"
The Redshirts had their big in- j
ning in the well-known seventh, i
Trautman led off with a three-base j
hit that barely got away from the
Bronc left-fielder. Livermore was
thrown out, shortstop to first. It
looked as if he beat the hit out by a
>,ood three feet, but Umpire Renton
had the sun in his eyes. Estes scored
Trautman with a clean single to
left, advanced on another by Gold- ;
man, and scored when Murray
booted Delmas' hit off second base. 1
Delmas was out trying to stretch ;
the blow into a double, and Rintala
grounded weakly to "Lefty" Powers
at first.
The Cards got another in the
eighth when Philippi drew a base
or. balls, advanced on Goodell's
single, and scored when Livermore
collected safely. And that was all
for that frame.
Indians Score
Burke had replaced Pitcher
Thomas in the eighth for Santa
Clara, and he started the ninth by
walking Goldmann and Delmas. i
Coach Mails sent in Manfredi, and
Rir.tala greeted him with a single, 1
which failed to score anyone. Miles I
went in to bat for Campbell and
pepped out to Murray, at short for
the Broncos. Philippi fouled the !
first two pitched balls high over
the backstop, and hit the third
straight into the hands of the Santa ■
Clara pitcher. Goldmann was forced
at the plate, and Philippi was dou- '
bled at first, Corbaline to Powers.
For Santa Clara, Judnich, Bech- ;
lich, and Powers led the batters
with two hits apiece. Bechrich also
came up with some nice catches in
left field to rob Indian hitters of
| seemingly sure bingles.

The bases loaded in the ninth j
with nobody out, a pop fly, a hit j
into a double-play, and Stanford J
dropped the second game of the I
season to the Santa Clara baseball ;
varsity yesterday on the Broncos' I
field.
Stanford faltered in the fourth in- ;
ning, when two errors put men 011
first and second, and Judnich poled
one of Caddel's offerings out of the
lot. Santa Clara increased the lead
to four, on a walk and a single, and !
then stood off the Indian challenge.
"Lucky Seventh"
The Redshirts had their big in- j
ning in the well-known seventh, i
Trautman led off with a three-base j
hit that barely got away from the
Bronc left-fielder. Livermore was
thrown out, shortstop to first. It
looked as if he beat the hit out by a
>,ood three feet, but Umpire Renton
had the sun in his eyes. Estes scored
Trautman with a clean single to
left, advanced on another by Gold- ;
man, and scored when Murray
booted Delmas' hit off second base. 1
Delmas was out trying to stretch ;
the blow into a double, and Rintala
grounded weakly to "Lefty" Powers
at first.
The Cards got another in the
eighth when Philippi drew a base
or. balls, advanced on Goodell's
single, and scored when Livermore
collected safely. And that was all
for that frame.
Indians Score
Burke had replaced Pitcher
Thomas in the eighth for Santa
Clara, and he started the ninth by
walking Goldmann and Delmas. i
Coach Mails sent in Manfredi, and
Rir.tala greeted him with a single, 1
which failed to score anyone. Miles I
went in to bat for Campbell and
pepped out to Murray, at short for
the Broncos. Philippi fouled the !
first two pitched balls high over
the backstop, and hit the third
straight into the hands of the Santa ■
Clara pitcher. Goldmann was forced
at the plate, and Philippi was dou- '
bled at first, Corbaline to Powers.
For Santa Clara, Judnich, Bech- ;
lich, and Powers led the batters
with two hits apiece. Bechrich also
came up with some nice catches in
left field to rob Indian hitters of
| seemingly sure bingles.
