# PACIFIC DEBATE RESULTS IN TIE
## Indians Uphold Centralized Industry Control 
### 
Stanford debaters were unable to
convince the audience that there
should be centralized control of in
dustry, when they debated with the
College of Pacific last night. An
audience poll on the conclusions re
sulted in a tie.
The debate was a return match
for all of the Stanford debaters,
David McDaniel, James Vizzard,
and James Bednar. The visiting ora
tors were Robert Griffin, Robert
Wright, and Richard C. Wood.
Opening the case for the affirma
tive, McDaniel scored the present
economic depression. He stated, "If
we aren't in a state of depression
at present, at least, we are in the
smallest boom we have ever seen."
Blaming overproduction as the
piinciple cause of depression, Mc-
Daniel said that charity or the dole
couldn't solve the problem.
Replying to the affirmative argu
ments, Griffin, first negative, de
nounced government control on the
grounds that it would open the way
for unlimited graft and corruption.
"Government control would inter
fere with individual freedom,"
stated the Stockton man.
Vizzard affirmed, "Certain basic
industries should be controlled by a
centralized government board."
Bednar continued the case by as
serting, "Centralized control is a
logical advance in government."
Wood argued for the negative,
"No superhuman board could be
created." His colleague, Wright,
stated, "Those who are hungry to
day would be hungry under the af
firmative plan."
