# LAW STUDENTS DEBATE TODAY
## Final Trial Of Moot Court On Mining Question 
### 
| Winners of the final trial of the
| second round of Moot Court of the
j Stanford law school will be decided
1 tonight when William Lawrence
| Shaw and Robert Nesbit Baker meet

I Gregg.
Arthur J. O'Keeffe. Jr., Stanford
! law professor, will judge the case
j on the merit of the arguments and
| briefs presented. The trial will be
j held in Room 12 of the Law Build-
I ing at 7:30 o'clock.
The case at bar involves a fraudu
; lent stock promotion in which the
j promoter made a secret profit by

I of the deal. The company, a mining
| corporation, sued to recover money
! accruing from the sale of mining
| properties. Decision in the case will
j probably hinge upon whether or
I not the corporation itself was in
j jured.
