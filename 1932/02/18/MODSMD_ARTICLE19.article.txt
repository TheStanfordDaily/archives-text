# Gillette Describes State Of Ancient Campus Ruts
## 
### WILLIAM RUBENS 
| Memories of the time when he
| pedalled around the Stanford cam
| pus on a two-wheeled bicycle were
i recounted last night by William
| Gillette, hawk-beaked portrayer of
, Siv Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock
j Holmes since the turn of the cen
! tury.
| As Gillette, now playing at the
Columbia Theatre, phrased it, the
! two-wheeler had much more fore
| than aft, reminding him of a flea
j hound trying to catch up with a
j Great Dane.
Thirty years after the event, Gil
lette vividly recalled the sad state
! ol the campus ruts, and has never
j revisited the scene of his mishaps.
; Raised to heaven on the seat of his
: bicycle though he was, Gillette ad
| milted falling to earth several
1 times, no mean feat. The sighst on
j the campus Gillette did not recall.

! Returning to San Francisco to I
; .uive a performance as the calmly j
dominating Holmes, Gillette remem- |
brri. racing a train for the fun of j
the thing. That night ho made love j
to the heroine, Miss Alice Falkner,
from a sitting position ....
Those were also the days when i
hi. chief ambition was to become a
night watchman so he could ring
bells. Bell-ringing as an indoor j
sport has always fascinated Gillette, j
j now past the Biblical span of three '
| j.core and ten. He attributed this to j
i the fact that, though his father was
| :i United States Senator from Con- j
i.ecticut, he made a forbidden ex- '
cursion to the theatre to hear the ,
j original Swiss bell-ringers.
Revealed by his Japanese boy was I
, an interesting fact about Gillette's j
haliits. "It takes twenty minutes," i
I .'.'id the boy, "lor the boss to wash :
all over."
