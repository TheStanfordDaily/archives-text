and French envoys, pursued his
j measures to bring the Chinese and
| Japanese together on a platform of
! conciliation,
Chinese leaders were conferring
too and Japanese consular officials
| were understood to be more amen
i able than heretofore.

i lowed another night and day of ar
. tlllery bombardment and machine
j feun firing along a front stretching
j from the ruined city of Chapei to
suburban Kaigwan.

; offensive which it was said would
| be the most intensive aircraft en
; gagement since the World War.
I The Chinese also were moving up
I planes from Canton.
Two British sailors from H.M.S.
