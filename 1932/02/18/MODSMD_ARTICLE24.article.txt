# Cottrell Says Hoover Plan Is 'Sound Policy'
## Central Control Necessary To Limit Duplication 
### Merlyn F. Mayger 
President Hoover's recommenda
tions made to Congress for his pro
posed changes in the executive de
partment were characterized here !
yesterday by Professor E. A. Cot- ,
trell of the Political Science depart
ment as being "sound, and follow- '
ing the best principles and practices j
of public administrative procedure." ;
Professor Cottrell, who worked!
on the plan during 1917 and 1918'
while with the Bureau of Efficiency, |
said, "That is a job that President
Hoover has been working on ever
since he became Secretary of Com
merce. It has been introduced in
pari as a result of the studies of the
Brown Reorganization Commission
under Harding, and the Consolida
tion of Law Enforcement and Vet- I
t rans' Affairs under the present ad
ministration.
"The need for reorganization and
consolidation is obvious to anyone
who has examined an outline chart
of the 200 separate units of govern
ment. The savings that can be
made will probably be principally
from the elimination of duplication
and overlapping functions.
"During the war," he continued,
"the Overman Bill gave President
Wilson exclusive power to do as he
pleased with any of the existing |
administrative machinery. The cares
of war, and the necessity of creat
ing departments and divisions to
win the war, did not leave time to
examine and rearrange the other
departments. This power granted to
the executive then lapsed.
"President Hoover recommends
that Congress place authority in
the hands of one group to make a
gradual and systematic reorganiza
lion.
"There is no doubt lhat there
should be created a public works
department, and an assistant secre
tary for public health, and other
officers which Hoover suggests,"
Cottrell stated. "His plan to cen
tralize personnel administration is
a step in the right direction, but
should be carried into a general
overhead department to be included
with the budget and to cover pur
chasing, buildings, pensions, and
printing. The department of general
administration will ihen apply
equally and uniformly to all the
activities of government.
"Congress has avoided the con
sideration of this pressing and
necessary step for many sessions,"
lie concluded. "If it is sincere in its
desire to eliminate inefficiency,
waste, and extravagance it will
take immediate steps to authorize a
reorganization and modernization
of the complicated federal machine.
This has been worrying every
president since Roosevelt. With the
tremendous hole in the treasury at
present, Hoover may get action."
