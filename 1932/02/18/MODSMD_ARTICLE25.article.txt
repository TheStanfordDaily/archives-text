Denouncing the present-day so
cial organization as controlled by
industrial autocracy, Harry W. Laid
ler, executive director of the League
for Industrial Democracy, spoke
yesterday in the Women's Clubhouse
on "Unemployment—ls There a
Way Out?"
The overwhelming despondency
of the country, the speaker said,
which has mounted steadily since j
the stock slump in 1929, is directly I
related to the system which spon
sors monopolies instead of the so- j
cialistic theory of industrial demo- |
cracy.
Socialism, Laidler insisted, neither
sponsors nor encourages the popu
lar ideas of state co-operative con
trol and equal compensation. It
advocates, rather, a reorganization '
of industry on a basis of democratic l
control, as opposed to the modern j
capitalistic system, he said.
Reflections of the new ideal, Laid- !
ler remarked, is found in the gen- j
oral enthusiasm of college students j
for the plan. For several years after
the war, • colleges schools of Busi-j
ness Administration were popular- i
ized by the idea of entering invest
ment businesses, but the depression
has brought a realization of the in
st curity of business bused on disre
gard of business cycles.
