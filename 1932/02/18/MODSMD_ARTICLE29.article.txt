News Uial the Cuivei'sity of Oklahoma lias just staged
a success 1 ti 1 "leap-year" dance silicosis lliat something of
1 11 c sort would he a very good idea oil this campus. What
with the depression and its attendant, hardships Stanford
social life is likely to fall off considerably during Spring
Quarter unless the .")()() conies to the rescue of faltering
male pocket-hooks.
The dance held at the opening of the new women's gym
last year was a move in the right direction and one that
could he made a precedent for an annual affair. I'p at the
I 'diversity of Washington the women put on a dance called
the "Tolo" each year, ;il which members of the fair sex
make all the arrangements, buy the bids, call for their part
ners, and even go to the length of feeding them afterwards.
There seems to be no real reason why such a custom
should not be instituted here, especially in view of the fact
that the majority of the local women students are in a bet
ter position financially than their masculine fellows. It
would inject a pleasing note of variety into the unchanging
round of Military Rail, Soph Cotillion, Junior Prom, Senior
Rail, and the other traditional all-campus dances, while
the Roble and sorority denizens would have a chance to
step out on their own account for once.
We await your pleasure, ladies.
