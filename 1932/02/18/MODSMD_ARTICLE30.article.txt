# ONLY A FOOL...

A poll conducted by the Daili/ Tar Heel, campus organ
of the University of North Carolina, reveals that out of !51
college daily editors investigated, .'iO favor the repeal of the
Kighteenlh Amendment and the Volstead Act.
These college men have the courage of youth to admit
errors and mistakes and to seek for a change that will
bring improvement. Prohibition is a costly failure and
hangs like a dead weight from the neck of the nation. The
rope should be cut and the country released before it is
dragged down any farther.
Too many of the supporters of prohibition, becoming
dogmatic with age, fear change and cover their eyes
against those tilings which thev think they should not see.
The futility of prohibition is apparent to those who will
look. Those who support the Kighteenlh Amendment
merely because they voted for it originally and now are
ashamed to admit their mistake should remember the
adage thai only a fool never changes his mind.
The New York World-'l'clefjram refers to the results of
the poll as an indication that the youth of today is prepared
"to undertake the future task of protecting the integrity
and consistency of the Constitution instead of mis-using it
for irrational experiment .... something for which the
nation today can be devoutly thankful."
