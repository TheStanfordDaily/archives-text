# A 						SORRY RETROGRESSION

"Xo speaker will l»e allowed lo speak on Ihe campus at
an open assembly if he intends lo allack Hie stale of na
tional government, specific individuals, or the University
itself. The University emphatically does not want so-called
'l»ed' speeches on the campus."
i( is hard to believe that tile above ultimatum could
issue from Ihe lips of a present-day college president, com
monly looked upon as the very standard-bearer of liberal
thinking ii. its tight to educate a narrow-minded world.
Ye I only lasf week President M. Lyle Spencer laid down
that dogmatic decree at the I Diversify of Washington, con
sidered a leader of education in the Northwest. At least,
until now if has been so regarded. Whether il can hold its
standing after this distinct backward step remains to be
seen.
Dr. Spencer's statement was inspired by an address of
Sherwood Eddy, well-known traveler and author of so
cialistic beliefs, delivered to the students of Washington
lasl week. Mr. Kddy h;is been heard with enthusiasm by
faculty and students of both Stanford and California. He
is a Yale graduate and holds a degree from Princeton.
II is gratifying lo note that Dr. Spencer's action has
aroused a sloi 111 of controversy at Washington and tTirough
(ii. 1 the Northwest. The student newspaper has flayed the
ultimatum of its own administration with commendable
courage. The Seattle press has hinted that Ihe interesting
talk of Mr. Kddy has sent Washington University leaders
"running for cover."
The Daily is not condemning or approving either so
cialism or capitalism. Nor is if attempting to solve the
problems of the University of Washington. II is, however,
viewing with genuine regret the attempt of a college presi
dent at a fellow Pacific Coast institution to coddle his stu
denfs in an incubator with apparent sincerity in believing
them too weak mentally and morally lo hear ;ill and decide
for themselves.
