# BULL SESSION
## POLITICIAN OR STATESMAN? 
### 
i Hoover entered the White House
with the reputation of not being a '<
politician. Now, after several years i
in the office, not many will argue I
with that contention. But also, not '
i many will deny that he has tried to
' be a politician and failed pretty ,
i badly. He is primarily an executive j
I —accustomed to commanding; and ,
j not a politician—who must cajole, ;
threaten, and implore. His advisors :
have attempted to make a candidate j
out of him by tacking to the man all 1
the little things that go over with I
the voters; but although they have, !
these little things have never been j
an integral part of Hoover and just |
stick out like so many artificial ap
pendages—much* too obvious.
Every time, then, that the Presi- .
! dent makes an official move, people j
| wonder whether a politician's ad- ;
vantage or a statesman's foresight I
was the basic motive. Probably this i
| has been most prevalent in his re- j
j cent appointment of Cardozo to the I
Supreme Court. On one hand, peo- j
ule say the fact that the man has a j
huge following in New York will ]
aid Hoover in that state during the j
next campaign. They also feel that j
j Hoover's appointment of a Demo- |
j crat will be a great talking point j
! for the voters in showing his im- [
| partiality. And also, the fact that |
- Cardozo is a liberal will win much j
! strength among those voters who !
| are thoroughly riled at "Rugged j
! Individualism" among a ragged I
' mass of unemployed.
I
' But, then on the other side of the I
! fence, there is as much if not more |

evidence that the appointment was
based solely on merit. Because there
was political advantage in Cardozo
is no reason at all to assume that it
was political advantage that caused
the appointment. When Holmes
stepped or tottered out of office,
there was felt a deep loss by lib
eral. 1 ' everywhere and by the general
public in many places. The Presi
dent no doubt also felt that the
Supreme Court had suffered. Be
cause, after all. even men in public
office retain their own human selves
to some extent.
Herbert Hoover, the man, wanted
to fill that place, and he picked Car
dozo. Any man in American judi
cial circles will have a most difficult
job attempting to replace the Grand
Old Man of the Supreme Court. The
new appointee comes as near filling
the niche as anybody. He is scholar
—a liberal—and a legal philosopher.
He is the type of man that both
New York Republicans and Demo
crats vote for; both party organiza
tions wanted him to be elected. And
that is a rare thing in New York—
where party lines are usually im
passable walls.
Whether Herbert Hoover —the Re
publican candidate in 1932 —ap-
pointed Cardozo, or whether Hoover,
the man, chose Cardozo—l don't
know. I would like to believe it was
the' latter. But in either case the
President did something commend
able and something most liberal
journals did not think he would
have the courage to do.
