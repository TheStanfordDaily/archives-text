i SHERLOCK HOLMES—With Wil-]
limn Gillette, at the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.
| The Columbia now is one place j
i where the play is not the thing, j
' Distinctly. Only William Gillette is. !
In swift-moving, plausible action;
! in perfection of technique; in the j
| effectiveness of the lesser lights; or j
! any of a dozen criteria of a good 1
! detective play, "Sherlock Holmes" i
| does not hold the proverbial candle \
j to anything done by an Owen or a
| Wallace.
Still; the play has Gillette, which j
; is plenty. The man who gave Sher- 1
: lock Holmes his own strong features !
! mt de this play very possible last j
i night. Without him, the play seemed j
! preposterous, and the players mere .
i puppets.
I With him, as the resourceful de- ;
j tcctive who at one and the same ,
lime recovers a pack of letters high
j ly incriminating to royalty, destroys !
1 his arch-enemy, the criminal Mori- ;
! arity, and falls in love, the audience
j lakes an interest in what's going on
upon the stage. And so will you. I

i SOB SISTER—At the New Mcnlo
j Theatre.
James Dunn surely lives up to the !
| "rep" he won for himself in "Bad
j Girl," although as a newspaper re- |
; porter from a conservative New
j York paper, the plot seems to get j
j him into too many scrapes.
Linda Watkins, as the "sob sister" j
from the tabloid, plays her part !
; aptly. The plot is somewhat trite at ;
I times, and the conclusion is at all
J times inevitable, although one isn't !
! sure just how it's to be brought!
J about. '
I There are bits of emotional acting
I —and just when the hero and the
' heroine get to philosophising about
about life and love a little too much 1
! for the good of the action, a kidnap- j
' ping side plot is opportunely intro- ;
; duced—gangsters going over coun- j
j try roads in high-powered cars at !
! 60 miles 'n hour YT everything.
"Sob Sister" as a whole is a good i
I play — but — this much-cracked-up
; "Si Cady's country store" idea put
lon by the American Legion was ;
! about the biggest flop in the way of i
entertainment we've seen. It's 0.K.,
, we s'pose, to give away groceries i
| to poor people and dejjf and dumb
j families, but why take an hour and
! a half of valuable time to do it? I

LADIES OF THE RIG HOUSE—At
the Stanford Theatre.

Sylvia Sidney laughs, loves,
! weeps, and leaps to freedom through
I several reels, with a penitentiary,
1 political intrigue, and a love tale
for background. She laughs at Gene
! Raymond's fuzzy blond hair, loves
1 it. weeps in it, then leaps into a
j salt-water bay to save it from the
j hangman's noose.
The show is good entertainment,
if you like Sylvie Sidney's laugh
| ing. loving, or weeping. Personally,
we liked her leaping best. There is a
| new slant on prison lift—jail-break
! ing female inmates. Interest picks
| up during the escape action, but,
| for (he rest—we've seen too many
| close-ups of Miss Sidney before.

CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE — At
the Varsity Theatre.
This is not one of those mystery
plays which follows the formula:
"a" plus "b" plus "c" minus "x"
equals much boring. There is the
usual endless string of clues, but
it is relieved by vivid touches, such
as the representation of a telephone
call to London and a scene in which
a gun is placed so that the warmth
of the sunlight will set it off.
Chan's latest problem is to solve
(he mystery of the death of a for
mer chief of Scotland Yard. All
kinds of people are implicated, from
a follies dancer to a manufacturer
of chemicals. Charlie, in this pic
ture, even comes up against another
Chinaman, who, you will be glad
to hear, does not succeed in van
quishing the thoughtful defective.
Chan's axioms, which he utters
with such a straight face, are the
best part of the show. One of them
is: "Man is not incurably drowned—
if he still know's he's all wet."'

CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE — At
the Varsity Theatre.
This is not one of those mystery
plays which follows the formula:
"a" plus "b" plus "c" minus "x"
equals much boring. There is the
usual endless string of clues, but
it is relieved by vivid touches, such
as the representation of a telephone
call to London and a scene in which
a gun is placed so that the warmth
of the sunlight will set it off.
Chan's latest problem is to solve
(he mystery of the death of a for
mer chief of Scotland Yard. All
kinds of people are implicated, from
a follies dancer to a manufacturer
of chemicals. Charlie, in this pic
ture, even comes up against another
Chinaman, who, you will be glad
to hear, does not succeed in van
quishing the thoughtful defective.
Chan's axioms, which he utters
with such a straight face, are the
best part of the show. One of them
is: "Man is not incurably drowned—
if he still know's he's all wet."'

LADIES OF THE RIG HOUSE—At
the Stanford Theatre.

Sylvia Sidney laughs, loves,
! weeps, and leaps to freedom through
I several reels, with a penitentiary,
1 political intrigue, and a love tale
for background. She laughs at Gene
! Raymond's fuzzy blond hair, loves
1 it. weeps in it, then leaps into a
j salt-water bay to save it from the
j hangman's noose.
The show is good entertainment,
if you like Sylvie Sidney's laugh
| ing. loving, or weeping. Personally,
we liked her leaping best. There is a
| new slant on prison lift—jail-break
! ing female inmates. Interest picks
| up during the escape action, but,
| for (he rest—we've seen too many
| close-ups of Miss Sidney before.

CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE — At
the Varsity Theatre.
This is not one of those mystery
plays which follows the formula:
"a" plus "b" plus "c" minus "x"
equals much boring. There is the
usual endless string of clues, but
it is relieved by vivid touches, such
as the representation of a telephone
call to London and a scene in which
a gun is placed so that the warmth
of the sunlight will set it off.
Chan's latest problem is to solve
(he mystery of the death of a for
mer chief of Scotland Yard. All
kinds of people are implicated, from
a follies dancer to a manufacturer
of chemicals. Charlie, in this pic
ture, even comes up against another
Chinaman, who, you will be glad
to hear, does not succeed in van
quishing the thoughtful defective.
Chan's axioms, which he utters
with such a straight face, are the
best part of the show. One of them
is: "Man is not incurably drowned—
if he still know's he's all wet."'

i SHERLOCK HOLMES—With Wil-]
limn Gillette, at the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.
| The Columbia now is one place j
i where the play is not the thing, j
' Distinctly. Only William Gillette is. !
In swift-moving, plausible action;
! in perfection of technique; in the j
| effectiveness of the lesser lights; or j
! any of a dozen criteria of a good 1
! detective play, "Sherlock Holmes" i
| does not hold the proverbial candle \
j to anything done by an Owen or a
| Wallace.
Still; the play has Gillette, which j
; is plenty. The man who gave Sher- 1
: lock Holmes his own strong features !
! mt de this play very possible last j
i night. Without him, the play seemed j
! preposterous, and the players mere .
i puppets.
I With him, as the resourceful de- ;
j tcctive who at one and the same ,
lime recovers a pack of letters high
j ly incriminating to royalty, destroys !
1 his arch-enemy, the criminal Mori- ;
! arity, and falls in love, the audience
j lakes an interest in what's going on
upon the stage. And so will you. I

i SOB SISTER—At the New Mcnlo
j Theatre.
James Dunn surely lives up to the !
| "rep" he won for himself in "Bad
j Girl," although as a newspaper re- |
; porter from a conservative New
j York paper, the plot seems to get j
j him into too many scrapes.
Linda Watkins, as the "sob sister" j
from the tabloid, plays her part !
; aptly. The plot is somewhat trite at ;
I times, and the conclusion is at all
J times inevitable, although one isn't !
! sure just how it's to be brought!
