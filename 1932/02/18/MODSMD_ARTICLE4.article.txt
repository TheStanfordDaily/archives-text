# BLAZE? BALONEY! FIREMEN SHOUT; BUT BLAZE IT IS
## 
### 
Probably the biggest sur
prise the Stanford fire depart
ment has been handed this year
came last night when the fire
laddies responded valiantly to
a hurry call from Branner hall,
and discovered on their ar
rival not the expected false
alarm, but a real honest-to
goodness blaze.
Somebody in Branner 139,
which is rightfully occupied by
Leo Traub and Ramsey Op
penheim, Jr., presumably went
of! and left a burning cigaret
in the wastebasket. Some time
later somebody else smelled
the smoke, saw the flames, got
out two lengths of fire hose,
broke into the locked room, and
proceeded to flood the place
until the regular firemen ar
rived with an extinguisher.
A large hole was burned in
the floor and the wall and win
dow sill were badly scorched.
Damage was estimated by of
ficials to be about $. r )0.
