IT'S JUST" around the corner.
That is, the southern division
basketball schedule will officially
end Saturday night, and the all-star
season will be upon us. Many ol |
the teams are already picked, and
are merely awaiting the close ol
play for release.
Since Saturday night's games can
hardly be expected to greatly affect
1 lie situation, we are going to jump
the gun a bit and hereby present
our all-southern division teams:
FIRST TEAM
Forward —Nemcr, U.S.C.
Forward—Kin tana, California
Center —Linthicuin, U.C.L.A.
C iuard—Norgard, Stanford
Guard—Bescos, U.S.C.
SECOND TEAM
Forward—Cordry, Stanford
Forward—Piper, U.C.L.A.
Center —Head, U.C.
(Hoard—LaCombe, Stanford
Guard—Rose, U.C.L.A.
THERE CAN be no question about I
three of those named on the first |
team —Nemer, Kintana, and Linthi- j
cum. They may be juggled around
a bit as to position, but are practi
cally certain to be on all the "ex
pei t" teams.
For that reason "Tiny Tom"
Cordry is pushed down onto the
second team, which is no place
at all for Tiny Tom. Likewise
Piper and LaCombe," two more
tine forwards, are on our sec
end string. LaCombe, in fact,
has to be shifted to guard, a
post which he filled with credit
in the first Los Angeles U.S.C.
encounter.
REALLY OUTSTANDING guards
v/i-re a rarity indeed this season.
Norgard, until he was injured, per
formed as well as any in the league,
in games which we saw. To him
would fall the burden of jumping
(■( nter for our mythical combination.
Bescos and Capps, the two U.S.C.
guards, were apparently about
equal, but Bescos is given the call
because of cleaner and more con
sistent playing. It was Capps who I
was the most frequently ejected I
from games for personal fouls.
As for the second combination, it
should be nearly as strong as the
first. It includes three of the best
shots in the league in Piper, Read,
and LaCombe, while Cordry and j
Rose are not to be sneezed at in I
the shooting department, and are t
excellent in floorwork.
Farm fans may not remember
Rose, as he had not rounded into
form in the U.C.L.A. games |
played here. According to those
who have seen him play else
where, however, he has been
brilliant ever since. —L.M.C.
