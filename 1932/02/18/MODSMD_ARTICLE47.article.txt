# Cards Prepare For Last Stand Against Bears
## RESERVES OPPOSE VARSITY SQUAD IN TOUGH SCRIMMAGE Cosgrove, Cordry, Norgard, Tod, Packard Remain Probable Starters 
### Dick Rodda 
Determined that his crippled team j
will give the California Bears a j
closer battle than that of last week, j
Coach John Bunn sent his outfit i
through another hard-fought scrim- j
mage last night in preparation for j
the final game of the annual Big !
Series here next Saturday night.
Bunn opened the scrimmage with
a five composed of Packard, Cos- j
grove, Palmer, Tod, and Norgard !
battling the reserves. After 15 or 20 !
minutes the subs were dismissed, i
and the second team opposed the
varsity for the rest of the afternoon, j
Bunn Undecided
Bunn still declined to announce j
an opening lineup until this after- j
mÂ»on, but a safe bet is that the i
above five, with Cordry in place of j
Palmer, will be on the floor at ihe j
opening whistle.
Dave Packard is almost certain to j
stai;t at center to control the tip-ofT. I
Last night the sophomore giant ;
played a good floor game as well, j
and succeeded in sinking several j
set-ups.
Norgard, Tod Paired
Jay Tod seems to be Bunn's I
choice to pair with Norgard in the j
guard position that is still open. ;
Tod has been mixing it up well in !
the last two or three practices, j
Baker and Edelen, however, are j
giving the former Menlo star a close !
battle.
John Hancock, who has recently
been used mostly at center, was:
switched to guard last night to team I
with Baker on the second squad, :
the rest of which was composed of s
Dou'o at center and Glasgow and j
Lambert at forwards.
Bears After Title J
Al Norgard, whose return to the 1
squad this week has somewhat j
strengthened the Indian hopes, i
looked almost in perfect form last. !
night. His ankle was heavily taped, !
but for the first time this week he j
did not seem to favor it.
The Bears, having cinched the
scries by their 33 to 16 win last
Saturday, are pointing to make it
three straight and insure themselves
of a tie for the southern division
title with U.S.C. With this in con- 1
sideration, it can hardly be ex- '
potted that the Indians can stop the
scoring combination of Kintana,
Read, and Seiffert, but with plenty
of fight, which the Redshirts have
had all season, the game will be
well worth watching.
