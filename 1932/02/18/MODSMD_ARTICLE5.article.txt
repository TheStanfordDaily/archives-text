# ORATORS DESERT TABLE POUNDING FOR CHINATOWN
## 
### 
Chinatown — that enticing,
glamorous haunt of romance,
the scene of oriental mysteries,
tho sinister playground for the
underworld of San Francisco's
storied past, the supreme tour
ist attraction of the city by the
Golden Gate —all its narrow
byways and curious habita
tions will be thoroughly inves
tigated by those past masters
of research, Stanford's varsity
debaters.
Deserting the forensic plat
form and the library reference
rooms for tonight, the table
pounding orators will meet for
a dinner of Chinese dishes at
the Hang Far Low Restaurant.
Arranged by Leland Chapin,
men's debate coach, the visit
will include a lour of China
town and a visit to the Great
China Theatre.
