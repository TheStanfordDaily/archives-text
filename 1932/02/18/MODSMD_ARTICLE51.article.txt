# IMPROVEMENT OF BROWN, KANTZER AIDS CARDINAL JAVELIN PROSPECTS
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
At the beginning of this track j
year, it was generally believed that
Stanford's strength in the javelin
war more or less evenly distributed
between A1 Ray, A1 Ray, Rudy Rin
tala, and A1 Ray. And then an in
dustrious senior whose efforts until
this year have been barren of use
ful result went and threw the spear
192 feet last Tuesday, and shed a
considerably brighter light on the
javelin situation.
The industrious senior is Dave
Brown, and he made his prodigious
heave after being a consistent 170-
foot thrower for two years. Last
year Brown was of little use to the
team because of the presence of Ray
and Fred Zuger, and because he
hurt his arm.
Exactly 9G hours (four days to
you) after Brown's efforts, Basil
Focock Kantzer stepped up and
added nearly twenty feet to his best
previous mark. Kantzer's throw
measured 180 feet, which is not bad
fcr a mere sophomore. Last year
Kantzer won the javelin in the
L itle Big Meet with a toss of 158
feet.
At least one reason for the im
provement of Brown and Kantzer is
the presence of an old Yale javelin
thrower on the track. This helpful
gentleman, who is now registered
in the Stanford law school, is named
Keisling, and he has been giving
the Stanford spear-tossers some ex
cellent advice.
Although never quite a star him
seit, Keisling has made a careful
study of the art of spearing track
opponents with an eight-foot piece

ci wood armed with an iron tip. As |
a result of this study, Keisling has j
been able to add about ten feet to |
the marks of each of the Indian ;
javelin-throwers.
Last year A1 Ray was one of the j
four or five best men in the coun- ,
try in his specialty. Ray was fourth !
in the 1.C.4-A. and finished second
in the U.S.C.-Stanford dual meet, j
Al's best mark was 196 feet, bul he :
has already tossed the spear 200 feet
,this year.
The man who beat Ray in the
Trojan meet was Mackenzie, and he
will be back this year. Ray evened
his score with Mackenzie when he
beat him in the 1.C.4-A.'s, but a
sophomore at U.S.C. named Wil
liamson threw the spear over 200
feet as a freshman. Therefore Stan
lord's javelin-throwers are not yet
undoubtedly the best in the coun
jtry-. , , ,!
Rintala is the man who received
! four major letters last year, getting
! his block "S" in track by tieing for
| third in the javelin in the U.S.C.
! meet. Rudy was good for about 180
; feet, and might have done better,
I had he elected to leave baseball
I alone and compete only in track
during the spring. If is not known
at ihe present time whether or not
I Rintala will come out for track this
! year.
j The fourth of the men now
: throwing the javelin is Jerry Dunn.
Dunn is a sophomore who has been
' good for about 165 feet. Like Kant
-1 ner. he should improve and lend
i valuable aid to Templeton's teams
| for the next two years.
