# CARD POLO TEAM READY FOR UTAH MATCH SATURDAY
## Strong Stanford Quartet Is Favored To Defeat Visiting Riders 
### Bill Myers 
With the field and the ponies both
in first-class shape, the Stanford
poloists promise some high-speed
polo in their match with the Uni
vei.'ity of Utah Saturday.
A quartet made up of Spalding,
Gillham and Spaulding at the num
start the game for the Cardinals. A
better-balanced team has probably
never represented Stanford. All four
rner. have played together for nearly
a year and have developed into a
smooth-working, hard-riding team.
Fleming Brilliant
Captain Bruce Fleming and Pete
Lewis loom as the big stars for the
Redshirt riders. Both are in their
fourth year of competition. Flem
ing, who plays number four, com
bines superb horsemanship with a
mighty drive, and is the mainstay
of the Indian defense.
Lewis, in spite of a pulled leg ten
don that is still somewhat bother
some, is a flashy, hard-riding player
who is in the midst of every play.
Spaulding Back
Also playing brilliant polo, al
though having less experience, are
Gillham and Spaulding at the Num
ber one and two positions. Spauld
ing wa sineligible to play last quar
ter, and will be striving in the Utah
games to cinch a regular berth on
the first string. Gillham has shown
unusually well this season and
should turn in his customary de
pendable game.
Melone, Boyles, and Holt, who
arc pressing the first string for their
places, all will probably get into the
game.
