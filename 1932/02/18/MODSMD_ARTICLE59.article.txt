### Albert Guerard 
Coach Vance Fawcett will send
' his yearling cagers through their
| last scrimmage of the 1932 season
! today or tomorrow in preparation
i for the final game of the year against
I Roseville High on Saturday night.
ll the Indians repeat their Tues-
I day night's showing, when they
j nearly gave the varsity a drubbing,
I they should close their season with
a victory. Roseville has won all but
' a it w games against interior high
schools, but Fawcett's quintet seems
to be rounding into real form for
the first time of the season.
Saturday's starting lineup should
decide at last the battle for first
j string positions that has been rag
j ing all season. The most torrid con
test is for the center post, with Tom
Sales, Tom Kelly, and Wally Crowe
; still battling on even terms.
Charles Coiner and Lory Rothert
j have an edge for the forward berths.
| Both men came up from reserve
; posts to beat out more experienced
; players for their jobs.
| Gordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte,
! two first-quarter freshmen, have
! held down the guard posts all year,
' and have been consistent at all
I times. Of the two, Butte is a trifle
' more promising prospect, although
j Mallatratt's wider experience has
I shown on various occasions. Two
| guards who have shown continual
| improvement throughout the sea
| son, Jim Savage and Johnny Mack,
I will see action Saturday.
