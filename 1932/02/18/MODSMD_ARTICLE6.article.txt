# STEFFENS WILL SPEAK TUESDAY
## "Changing One's Mind' To Be Liberal's Topic 
### 
Dr. Lincoln Steffens, noted liberal
writer and lecturer, will speak
Tuesday night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall on "Changing One's
Mind." His associations with na
tional and international figures and
events which have led to a change
of his ideas concerning world af
fairs will be the subject of the ad
dress.
Acquaintance with public men in
America and abroad through his
work as a journalist and investi
gator has prepared Dr. Steffens to
give a vivid record of his experi
ences and opinions on world affairs.
As a journalist, he has had numer
ous opportunities to see the inside
of the most important government
situations of the last 25 years.
Dr. Steffens is especially well
known for his recently published
autobiography, which, he says, Ls a
story of a boy who became inter
ested in the nature of the good and
the bad, and who started to investi
gate. The book reviews the results
of this effort, which has allowed
him to know political conditions
throughout the world.
A San Franciscan by birth, Dr.
Steffens graduated from the Uni
versity of California, and as a stu
dent of philosophy, studied at the
universities of Berlin, Heidelberg,
Leipzig, the Sorbonne, and Paris.
