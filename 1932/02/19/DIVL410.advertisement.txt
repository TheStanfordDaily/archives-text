GOLDEN
TURKISH
is one of the 5 fine tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS
Founder of the blend
Tlie Golden Turkish in COLO
NEL ADAMS mixture is what
gives off the sweet aroma, so
much admired by pipe smokers.
It is imported direct from
Turkey where the soil and
climate make possible this
most fragrant of all tobaccos.
Golden Turkish is very costly,
as each leaf must be graded
by native experts, and only a
few of the best leaves are
found to be of accepted
quality.
Like all (he tobaccos in
C OLON E L ADA M S, our
Turkish is aged 4 to 5 years
before packing.
That's wby COLONEL
ADAMS is mild and sweet
and doesn't bite your tongue
like unseasoned tobacco.
