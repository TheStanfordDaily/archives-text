Moby Dick
So from now on, this tough, tugged-facecj,
real SHARKSKIN oxford will be known as
"Moby Dick"' to you . . . and you . . . and you.
If there ever was a real he-man's shoe this is
it. No pretense about it . . . it's handsome in a
rough, honest sort of way, is trimmed in a
simple manner, has a good stout sole, and
wears like iron. Both black and brown.
