# STANFORD BALL TEAM TO MEET MORAGA OUTFIT
## Cardinal Diamond Artists Play St. Mary's Nine Here Saturday ANDERSON MAY PITCH Infield Looked Bad During Santa Clara Series 
### Bob Wade 
Having squeezed out a win in the
first Santa Clara game, but having
been squeezed out of another in the
second, Stanford's varsity baseball
team takes on the Saint Mary's nine
Saturday afternoon at 2:30 in the
Indian ball park.
The Redshirts managed to pull the
first game out of the fire when the
two consecutive pinch-hitters came
through with a perfect bunt and a
single, respectively. Hearn and Miles
were the two substitutes in the first
fracas, but in the second contest,
when Wolter's men again needed a
single, Miles' over-anxiety made him
pop weakly to the shortstop. Just
another incident that goes to prove
that you can't have all the luck all
the time.

At the start of the season the In
dians looked like the class of the
league, with the loop's leading pitch
er, a veteran key-stcne combination,
and a couple of two-year outfielders.
Now that the season has gone
through two games, and the Indians
have dropped one of them, the fans
are beginning to wonder if the Farm
boys are going to keep the confer
ence pennant anywhere near the vi
cinity of Stanford.
Fail in Pinches
Last year the Indians nearly lost
the crown by leaving all the burden
of winning ball games on the pitch
ing staff, and in the second Santa
Clara game, they seemed to be af
flicted with the same weakness. The
pitchers and the outfielders have
come through fairly well so far. Both
Rintala and Goldmann came up with
nice catches against the Broncs, and
Campbell overcame the plowed-up
condition of right field to record a
pair of put-outs. But the infield has
managed to boot six errors in two
games played so far. This is slightly
better than an error for each of the
live men.
Wednesday's battle was a hard one
for big Ernie Caddel to lose. The
Broncos scored just one earned run
to the Indians' three. In other words
Caddell should have two wins to
his credit, 5-3 and 3-1, instead of
one victory and one defeat.
Lineup Uncertain
The game brought out the fact that
Wolter's batting order is anything
but settled for the season. As things
look now Wolter will probably move
Fhilippi to the clean-up position,
number four behind Rintala, and
shift Campbell down to seven or
eight. Campbell is one of the smooth
est fielders on the squad, but so far
he hasn't been able to connect.

through two games, and the Indians
have dropped one of them, the fans
are beginning to wonder if the Farm
boys are going to keep the confer
ence pennant anywhere near the vi
cinity of Stanford.
Fail in Pinches
Last year the Indians nearly lost
the crown by leaving all the burden
of winning ball games on the pitch
ing staff, and in the second Santa
Clara game, they seemed to be af
flicted with the same weakness. The
pitchers and the outfielders have
come through fairly well so far. Both
Rintala and Goldmann came up with
nice catches against the Broncs, and
Campbell overcame the plowed-up
condition of right field to record a
pair of put-outs. But the infield has
managed to boot six errors in two
games played so far. This is slightly
better than an error for each of the
live men.
Wednesday's battle was a hard one
for big Ernie Caddel to lose. The
Broncos scored just one earned run
to the Indians' three. In other words
Caddell should have two wins to
his credit, 5-3 and 3-1, instead of
one victory and one defeat.
Lineup Uncertain
The game brought out the fact that
Wolter's batting order is anything
but settled for the season. As things
look now Wolter will probably move
Fhilippi to the clean-up position,
number four behind Rintala, and
shift Campbell down to seven or
eight. Campbell is one of the smooth
est fielders on the squad, but so far
he hasn't been able to connect.
Having squeezed out a win in the
first Santa Clara game, but having
been squeezed out of another in the
second, Stanford's varsity baseball
team takes on the Saint Mary's nine
Saturday afternoon at 2:30 in the
Indian ball park.
The Redshirts managed to pull the
first game out of the fire when the
two consecutive pinch-hitters came
through with a perfect bunt and a
single, respectively. Hearn and Miles
were the two substitutes in the first
fracas, but in the second contest,
when Wolter's men again needed a
single, Miles' over-anxiety made him
pop weakly to the shortstop. Just
another incident that goes to prove
that you can't have all the luck all
the time.

At the start of the season the In
dians looked like the class of the
league, with the loop's leading pitch
er, a veteran key-stcne combination,
and a couple of two-year outfielders.
Now that the season has gone
through two games, and the Indians
have dropped one of them, the fans
are beginning to wonder if the Farm
boys are going to keep the confer
