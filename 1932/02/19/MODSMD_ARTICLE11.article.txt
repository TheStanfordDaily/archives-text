"I admire the self-control of the
Americans. I have never heard any
people curse in traffic here as we
curse in Europe. Even in pleasure
you have self-control," he said.
Jurgensen believes prohibition
cannot be called a failure, although
i! is not an entire success; he thinks
it has helped the lower classes.
"You Americans have certainly
conquered distance, but also have
become subjects to the instruments

I of transportation. You miss the op
j portunities to walk."
