# CLOSE DECISION IN MOOT TRIAL
## Churchill And Gregg Win Corporation Case 
### 
Winning an extremely closely
contested decision, Perry Churchill
and Douglas Clark Gregg defeated
William Lawrence Shaw and Robert
Nesbit Baker in the last trial of the
semi-final round of Moot Court held
in Room 12 of the Law Building last
night at 7:30 o'clock. Arguments
were marked by frequent clashes
over points of law.
Arthur J. O'Keeffe, Jr., Stanford
law professor judging the case, held
that an injury was inflicted on a
mining corporation whose stock had
been watered by promoters, even
when the suit to recover was
brought by the corporation on be
half of the stockholders.
James Hill, a promoter, "held
out" some of the stock received in
payment for mining lands. The ap
pellants, Gregg and Churchill, hold
that Hill should have made known
all benefits accruing from sale re
gardless of whether he took a por
tion of the stock as payment for
services. Such secret profits
he received constituted an injury
to the corporation, the complaint
averred.
Baker and Shaw, attorneys for
the defense, pointed out that in
most jurisdictions, stockholders' in
terests in cases of frauds may not
be protected by suit of the corpora
tion defrauded.
O'KeefTe, however, upheld the
complaint when he refused to pierce
the legal entity of the corporation
and declare a suit by the corpora
tion on behalf of the stockholders
invalid. As such, he ruled that an
actual, if not a strictly legal, cor
porate injury had been done, and
therefore the stockholders could re
cover under terms of the suit by
the corporation.
