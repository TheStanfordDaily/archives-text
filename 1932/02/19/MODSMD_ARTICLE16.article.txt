# SAFFORD FEATURES FRENCH ORGANISTS IN SUNDAY RECITAL
## 
### 
In his program Sunday in the
Stanford Memorial Church at 4
o'clock, Charles L. Safford, visiting
j organist, will play compositions of
J three of the most famous French
organists.
Saint-Saens is one of this famous
trio. So far as skill and technical
knowledge goes, he ranks remark -
j ably high. It has often been said
of his music, however, that it is
i more brilliant than moving, and is
| characterized by a certain coldness
and indifference to ideas. In reality,
| his imagination asserted itself far
j more in the treatment of his ma
! lerials than in actual inventions, it
i is declared.
I Sunday's program will include the
j following numbers:
i Toccata in F Widor
: Adagio in E Flat Saint-Saens
j Choral Prelude, "Sleepers, Wake!"
J. S. Bach
j Marche Religieuse Guilmant
