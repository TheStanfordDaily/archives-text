# GOT THREE LEGS? GET A SACK AND WIN SOME PRIZES
## 
### 
This afternoon's interclass
track meet will be livened up
by a series of novelty races
and a 24-lap Irish marathon.
The special events include a
steeplechase, a three-legged
race, a sack race, and a 100-
yard dash run backward.
Palo Alto stores have con
tributed prizes for the novelty
events that should make them
closely contested as well as
very amusing. The successful
steeple-chaser will receive a
$7.50 pair of flannels from Roos
Brothers, and the pair of run
ners who can best move them
selves around on three legs will
win a two-pound box of candy
apiece from Wilson's.
Wideman's will donate a
glove order to the best of the
sack-hampered runners. The
crawfish - minded individual
who wins the backward race
will get a five-dollar merchan
dise order from Phclps-Terkel.
