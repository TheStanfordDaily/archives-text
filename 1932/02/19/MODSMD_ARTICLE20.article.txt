## 
### 
!
With hopes of a repeat victory i
foremost in their minds, the fresh- j
man water polo men will take on '
Sequoia High this afternoon at 4:30 j
o'clock in the Encina pools. Since j
the yearlings' win over Sequoia a j
week ago last Wednesday, the in- ,
vaders have won the championship
of Northern California Schools 1
for the third consecutive year.
Fart of the Babe chances lie with j
Vlad Taranik. who may be unable
to play because of an infection.
Taranik will probably be on hand, I
however, to take his position at cen- i
tor back. The remainder of the line- i
up will be as usual—Triolo al !
sprint, Boothe and Benot at for
ward, Hirsch and Fitting at guard,
and Cook at goal.
Last week the high-school outfit
was rather weak in the goal, but it
is reported that they have shifted
their line-up for today's contest.
Worrell at sprint, Martin at guard, |
and Adams, another guard, are
three invaders who are bound to
worry the babes from beginning to
end. Sequoia has not lost a prep- j
school game to anyone in three i
jeais, with the exception of Venice j
High, which took the slate cham- J
pienship last year.
