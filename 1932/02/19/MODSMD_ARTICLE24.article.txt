# STILL IN A RUT
## 
### 
A very, very short slop has been taken by the women
toward the attaining of intercollegiate competition, and
that is that class teams from the separate schools may play
together as a unit.
t'p to this year, the Athletic Conference of American
College Women, of which Stanford is a member, would
not sanction class competition between schools, but decreed
instead that members of classes should band together to
play other classes. That is, tlie freshmen women of Mills,
Stanford, California and San .lose, would form one team
and play the sophomores from the same institutions. The
result, as far as teamwork and proficiency goes, can well
be imagined.
This year the platform of the A.C.A.C.W. is a hazy,
meaningless statement which prohibits nothing. Thus it is
up to the individual schools to decide their own policy, for
even straight intercollegiate competition would be no vio
lation of any rule of the organization.
At the annual Triangular Sports Day last fall class
teams played against class teams. However, with the dread
fear that schools might be playing against schools, the ath
letic advisors laid down the restriction that a team from
one class must play teams of different classes from other
schools. I hat is, the Stanford freshman basketball team
may not plav the freshman basketball team from Mills or
California, oh no! It could plav the sophomore, junior or
senior teams from those schools, but not the freshmen. The
same thing applies to teams from other classes.
The objections of the athletic advisors to intercollegiate
competition are fourfold: It would bring undesirable pub
licity upon the school; it would lessen the dignity of Stan
ford women; if would be unsportsmanlike; it would give
rise to commercialism.
I he silliness of such objections is obvious. The publicitv
gained from having shir women athletes at Stanford would
be highly desirable. If anything would lessen the dignity
of the women, it would be the feeble performances of these
mixed teams. Why intercollegiate competition would be
unsportsmanlike is a puzzle. Clean competition between
schools usually has the opposite reaction. And anyone who
ever saw a girls' basketball team in action would never
again mention commercialism.
The athletic advisors admit that these objections are
only possibilities but their timidity in fearing to try it out
dooms the women to this uninteresting competition.
I he W.A.A. is firmly behind intercollegiate competition
and unofficial reports have it that Mills and San Jose also
favor it but all moves are blocked by the advisors of the
institutions.
However, tin- Stanford shiff' indicates that it might not
be opposed to varsity competition in such sports as tennis,
golf and swimming. But no other school lt-ns ever sug
gested it.
Why should not Stanford su ggc st it?
I'lioW.A.A. has at least the initiating power and could
probably receive favorable action by the advisors. If the
women have any ambition left, they should at least make
an attempt to get out of the rut to which they have been so
long confined.

play other classes. That is, tlie freshmen women of Mills,
Stanford, California and San .lose, would form one team
and play the sophomores from the same institutions. The
result, as far as teamwork and proficiency goes, can well
be imagined.
This year the platform of the A.C.A.C.W. is a hazy,
meaningless statement which prohibits nothing. Thus it is
up to the individual schools to decide their own policy, for
even straight intercollegiate competition would be no vio
lation of any rule of the organization.
At the annual Triangular Sports Day last fall class
teams played against class teams. However, with the dread
fear that schools might be playing against schools, the ath
letic advisors laid down the restriction that a team from
one class must play teams of different classes from other
schools. I hat is, the Stanford freshman basketball team
may not plav the freshman basketball team from Mills or
California, oh no! It could plav the sophomore, junior or
senior teams from those schools, but not the freshmen. The
same thing applies to teams from other classes.
The objections of the athletic advisors to intercollegiate
competition are fourfold: It would bring undesirable pub
licity upon the school; it would lessen the dignity of Stan
ford women; if would be unsportsmanlike; it would give
rise to commercialism.
I he silliness of such objections is obvious. The publicitv
gained from having shir women athletes at Stanford would
be highly desirable. If anything would lessen the dignity
of the women, it would be the feeble performances of these
mixed teams. Why intercollegiate competition would be
unsportsmanlike is a puzzle. Clean competition between
schools usually has the opposite reaction. And anyone who
ever saw a girls' basketball team in action would never
again mention commercialism.
The athletic advisors admit that these objections are
only possibilities but their timidity in fearing to try it out
dooms the women to this uninteresting competition.
I he W.A.A. is firmly behind intercollegiate competition
and unofficial reports have it that Mills and San Jose also
favor it but all moves are blocked by the advisors of the
institutions.
However, tin- Stanford shiff' indicates that it might not
be opposed to varsity competition in such sports as tennis,
golf and swimming. But no other school lt-ns ever sug
gested it.
Why should not Stanford su ggc st it?
I'lioW.A.A. has at least the initiating power and could
probably receive favorable action by the advisors. If the
women have any ambition left, they should at least make
an attempt to get out of the rut to which they have been so
long confined.
A very, very short slop has been taken by the women
toward the attaining of intercollegiate competition, and
that is that class teams from the separate schools may play
together as a unit.
t'p to this year, the Athletic Conference of American
College Women, of which Stanford is a member, would
not sanction class competition between schools, but decreed
instead that members of classes should band together to
play other classes. That is, tlie freshmen women of Mills,
Stanford, California and San .lose, would form one team
and play the sophomores from the same institutions. The
result, as far as teamwork and proficiency goes, can well
