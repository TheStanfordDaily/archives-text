# DINK'S TOUGHEST BREAK
## 
### 
I rack will lake ils bow on the old oval this afternoon as
the interelass meet, always an invaluable barometer of
Stanford prospects, introduces to fans the Redskin in
shorts and spiked shoes.
Hut the man who has been master of ceremonies at this
event for more than ten years will not be there today. Dink
f einplcton is in a San Francisco hospital, convalescing from
an acute attack of arthritis which has confined him to bed
for three and a half months.
Always a fighter, aggressive, Dink has built Stanford
track to the top of the nation's heap. And because he is a
fighter, ever saying exactly what he thinks in no uncertain
manner, he has been criticized, called a "squawker." Hut
that has never bothered him. Where he is known be is ad
mired and respected almost as much for his abilifv to "take
'em" as for 11 is coaching mastery.
Hut confinement at this time is one of the toughest
blows Dink has ever been called upon to "take." A long
season is ahead, 1-A at Rerkelcv, Olympics at Los An
geles the ('.oast will be fairly buzzing with track almost
trom today the Coast will be fairly buzzing with track al
from today on. He belongs right in the thick of this excite
ment. He is a part of the track world, and revels in its
doings.
el Dink will be lucky to gel out to the track before late
March, and it will probably be late summer before lie is
reallv "right" again.
