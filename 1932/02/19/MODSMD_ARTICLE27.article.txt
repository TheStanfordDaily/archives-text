# BULL SESSION
## WHY NOT LOCKOUTS? 
### 
ll' the Administration is for it,

That is only natural. That is one
reason why the women are con
tinually maligning that venerable
institution — "Lockouts." Further-
I more, it rankles the women that
they should be restricted while the
men are footloose and fancy free—
I coming and going as they see fit.
{ They take this myth of equality
seriously in speech and thought—
and yet of course demand inequal
ity in everything from hats off in
1 elevators to vehicle precedence at
busy intersections. To defend lock
j outs is to smear oneself with what
the women would term "narrow
minded Mid-Victorianism"—a most
brutal phrase.
There are two local reasons for
| lockouts. At most co-educational in
i stitutions the odds are so arranged
, that even allowed to boom at will,
| the co-eds would not spend an ex
cessive number of mornings hailing
milkmen. But here, with odds six
to Gne mathematically and even
greater socially—as practically all
men will date, given a car and cash,
while not all women can rate dates
! —let down the bars here and the
number of women that would never
catch up on sleep would be matched
by the number of flunk-outs. Then
| also, there are so many young fe
| male "prodigies" that come to Stan
! ford—whose youth is more notice
; obie than anything else. These poor
; creatures would be (he first to suf
| for very long.
I
Then to face the matter squarely,
! without bowing to modern jabber
j ings, it must be admitted women
j need to be taken care of. At home,
I they have a mother; and here they
| need lockouts. The number of

I women who ever suggest going
home—when there is no restriction
! looming over and around them—is
i pitifully few. Whether they don't
want to be "chicken"—or whether
they feel it is the male's duty to
j start home—l don't know. But the
fact remains that without lockouts
staling them in the face and beating
them on the head, they probably
never would get home.
But flashes brck the hard-bfeath
ing exponent of the single standard,
, "What about the man?" First of all,
the financial burden of dating is a
very satisfactory check on most
I men. Not many can afford booming
seven nights in a week—at least not
for very lond.
Furthermore, men take the of
fensive in dating—they must call;
all a woman need do is answer
I "yes" when the telephone rings,
i That means because humans are
j fundamentally lazy and addicted to
procrastinating, a popular woman
| will date more frequently than a
! similar man. And of course —
i whether due to heredity or our so
! cial environment—men usually take
1 care of themselves better than
| women.
Now there is nothing divine or
holy in the hours 1:30 or 2:3o—and
we are not defending or even dis
cussing them., But the reputation—
if nothing else—of the college wom
jan cannot help but suffer if she
i makes a practice of bringing in the
morning paper off the doorstep as
; she comes home from a date. This
! may be due to a narrow Puritan
| legacy—but it is here just the same.
For the reputation of the "500"
! lockouts are indispensable and
: highly desirable.
