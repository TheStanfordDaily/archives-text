# Men's Council Hits Honor Code Violater With Heavy Penalty
## Senior Is Ousted When Classmates' Evidence Nets Conviction for Cheating; Fines Meted Out For Campus Traffic Infringements 
### 
'J' HREE QUARTERS' suspension yesterday was the penalty meted out
to a student convicted by Men's Council of violating the Honor Code.
The case, the council reported, had been under investigation for a week
before the decision was announced. The suspended man was within one
quarter of graduation.
''Two students," council members said, "turned in the case. We feel
that this action, undertaken voluntarily by students, can be interpreted
as an indication of increased interest in the Honor Code. In the past,
almost all cases of violations have been reported by faculty members.
There now seems to be an upward swing in student anxiety to see the

r code properly observed, and today's
I case is one manifestation of this
j feeling."
In yesterday's case, the council
I said, the individual had copied into
j an examination information taken
I into the class in note form, and was
| observed over a considerable period
j ox time during the hour.
The suspended student will be al
| lowed to return to Stanford at the
I end of three quarters.
I Following disposition of the Hon
j or Code case, the council considered
a number of traffic violations. For
the first time, names of offenders
â–  are published in the Daily.
William Waltman, arrested for
speeding past the physics corner,
was fined $5.
Richard Benjamin Strouse was
i fined $1 for driving up the steps at
j Roble Hall.
Four other students, fined for il
j legal parking, were: G. B. Fry, Rob
; ert Burgren, Leon W. Scales, and
j David J. Lercari.
Zones on the campus whieh have
proved most troublesome to Stan
ford drivers recently are: Lomita
Drive past the physics corner, and
Galvez street and Pine avenue past
Encina Gymnasium for speeding.
Parking difficulties are most fre
quent on the Encina lawn; the
parking area opposite the engineer
ing corner, where automobiles are
parked in such a manner as to pre-
I ciude the possibility of passage of
! other cars; and the pavement in
j front of the Library.
