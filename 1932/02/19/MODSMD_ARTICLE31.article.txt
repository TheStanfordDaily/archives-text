# Interclass Track Meet Promises Stiff Competition
## SENIORS FAVORED FOR TITLE; STARS IN FINE CONDITION Graduates To Participate For Fourth-Year Men; Admission Free 
### 
By Dick Strouse
At exactly 3:15 o'clock this after
noon on the old oval, Stanford's
renior class plans to launch an ir
rcsistable drive for the interclass
track championship. Although every
event on the program should be
close, there seems to be nothing chat
the three lower classes can do to
prevent the seniors from demon
strating their rightful superiority
over their lesser and younger
brethren.
The presence of numerous talent
ed grads on the senior squad is an
important cause of that class's op
timism. The powers that rule inter
class track meets have decided that
the points scored by West, Wright,
Dowell, Podge Smith, Brown, and
any other ancient and slightly obese
ttacksters will count toward the
senior cause.
Shot-Put Close
The best of the day's events
should be the shot-put, in which
senior Grey will find that juniors
Gray and Laborde as well as sopho
more Lyman have no reverence for
age. Miller of the Class of '33 has
similar designs toward upsetting the
experienced Messrs. DeGroot and
Johns of the seniors in the pole
vault.
Ferrie, Herbert, and the Eastman i
brothers are the only other non
si niors with better than an even
chance of winning. Ferrie and Sam .
Ei.ytman will try and take Brown
and Atkinson in the mile, and Ben i
Eastman should score a win in
either the 220 or the 440. Herbert
should be able to outlast Podge j
Smith in the low hurdles.
Seniors in 100
The 100 will find Giberson, Les
Hables, and Lombardi staging a
private battle for the championship
of the senior class as well as of the
meet. Willson is out, due to an in
jury, but A1 Blackman, Ben East
man, and good old John Lauritzen
should add interest to the event.
For the first time this year, most
of the two-milers are in good shape,
and letterman Aebersold will try [
to fight off the challenge of Am- j
dahi, Morentin, and Azevedo. The j
880 should be very much a Wright- j
Fullenwider duel with sophomore :
captain de Bretteville, Burch, and i
Naylon out after third place.
Butler will have a bit of compe- j
tition in the broad-jump this after- j
noon, most of which will come from :
fellow seniors. 1.C.4-A. champion j
West, ex-star Dowell, and Bill f
Wei der of the varsity should make '
the event worth watching. Williams, !
a sophomore, may find the competi- 1
tion a bit stiff. J
With Jones out of the discus, it j
will become an event exclusively for j
shot-putters and Puss Robinson. !
The high hurdles will be a Smith-
Erugman-Meier-Stallings contest,!
?nd the high-jump finds Austin and j
Bon Blackman, seniors, favored j
over freshman Schween.

chance of winning. Ferrie and Sam .
Ei.ytman will try and take Brown
and Atkinson in the mile, and Ben i
Eastman should score a win in
either the 220 or the 440. Herbert
should be able to outlast Podge j
Smith in the low hurdles.
Seniors in 100
The 100 will find Giberson, Les
Hables, and Lombardi staging a
private battle for the championship
of the senior class as well as of the
meet. Willson is out, due to an in
jury, but A1 Blackman, Ben East
man, and good old John Lauritzen
should add interest to the event.
For the first time this year, most
of the two-milers are in good shape,
and letterman Aebersold will try [
to fight off the challenge of Am- j
dahi, Morentin, and Azevedo. The j
880 should be very much a Wright- j
Fullenwider duel with sophomore :
captain de Bretteville, Burch, and i
Naylon out after third place.
Butler will have a bit of compe- j
tition in the broad-jump this after- j
noon, most of which will come from :
fellow seniors. 1.C.4-A. champion j
West, ex-star Dowell, and Bill f
Wei der of the varsity should make '
the event worth watching. Williams, !
a sophomore, may find the competi- 1
tion a bit stiff. J
With Jones out of the discus, it j
will become an event exclusively for j
shot-putters and Puss Robinson. !
The high hurdles will be a Smith-
Erugman-Meier-Stallings contest,!
?nd the high-jump finds Austin and j
Bon Blackman, seniors, favored j
over freshman Schween.

At exactly 3:15 o'clock this after
noon on the old oval, Stanford's
renior class plans to launch an ir
rcsistable drive for the interclass
track championship. Although every
event on the program should be
close, there seems to be nothing chat
the three lower classes can do to
prevent the seniors from demon
strating their rightful superiority
over their lesser and younger
brethren.
The presence of numerous talent
ed grads on the senior squad is an
important cause of that class's op
timism. The powers that rule inter
class track meets have decided that
the points scored by West, Wright,
Dowell, Podge Smith, Brown, and
any other ancient and slightly obese
ttacksters will count toward the
senior cause.
Shot-Put Close
The best of the day's events
should be the shot-put, in which
senior Grey will find that juniors
Gray and Laborde as well as sopho
more Lyman have no reverence for
age. Miller of the Class of '33 has
similar designs toward upsetting the
experienced Messrs. DeGroot and
Johns of the seniors in the pole
vault.
Ferrie, Herbert, and the Eastman i
brothers are the only other non
si niors with better than an even
chance of winning. Ferrie and Sam .
Ei.ytman will try and take Brown
and Atkinson in the mile, and Ben i
Eastman should score a win in
either the 220 or the 440. Herbert
