tions has been close. Lory Rothert
at one forward, and Joe Butte and

tain to start, while Charles Coiner
has a very slight edge over Frank
Cox for forward.
Turn Sales, Wally Crowe, and Tom
Kelly are as closely matched as any
tip-off men could be, and all three,
as well as Joe Griswold, another
good center, will see action during
the contest. First one and then an
other of the four centers have led
the babe pack.
Sales started out the season as a
guard, Crowe, Griswold, and Kelly
as forwards. Sales is the best of the
feur at getting the tip-off, Crowe
the best passer, Griswold the best
shot, while Kelly has a fairly smooth
floor game.
