Delta Upsilon beat the Sequoia I ,
five 10-6 in their intramural basket- J
ball game last night, but it took two j
long baskets in the last few minutes j
of play to give the D.U.'s this four- !
point victory.
With the score 6-3 against Se- !
quoia, Mark Sullivan sank his foul
try and Ed Coombs dropped one in
from under the basket to place the
two teams in a 6-6 deadlock. The
count remained the same for several
minutes, until Howie Folsom, D.U.
forward, put one through the hoop j
on an overhead shot from the foul !
line. Aksel Nyeland put the game
on ice for the D.U.'s with another
ringer from the sidelines.
First Phi Kap Win
Phi Kappa Sigma broke into the :
win column for the first time last i
night by trouncing Sigma Nu 27-11 ;
in a game that was more one-sided ;
than the score indicates. The win- 1
ners held a 13-0 lead at half time, j
and easily coasted through to vic
tory, although Sigma Nu garnered ;
.11 points in the last period.
Fred Lindsley scored eight mark- I
ers for the Phi Kaps, with his j
teammate, Fred Coonradt, register- j
ing 6. Lewis Lee and Howie Buller
scored seven of the loser's eleven
points.

deadlock for the leadership of j

feited to the Dekes, while the El j
