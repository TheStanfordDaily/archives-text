## Encina 2W Attends Jolly Up; Forfeits Game LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS Delta Upsilon 10, Sequoia I, 6 Phi Kappa Sigma 27, Sigma Nu 11 
### Maurice Rapf 
Delta Upsilon beat the Sequoia I
five 10-6 in their intramural basket-
ball game last night, but it took two
long baskets in the last few minutes
of play to give the D.U.'s this four-
point victory.
With the score 6-3 against Se-
quoia, Mark Sullivan sank his foul
try and Ed Coombs dropped one in
from under the basket to place the
two teams in a 6-6 deadlock. The
count remained the same for several
minutes, until Howie Folsom, D.U.
forward, put one through the hoop
on an overhead shot from the foul
line. Aksel Nyeland put the game
on ice for the D.U.'s with another
ringer from the sidelines.
First Phi Kap Win
Phi Kappa Sigma broke into the
win column for the first time last
night by trouncing Sigma Nu 27-11
in a game that was more one-sided
than the score indicates. The win-
ners held a 13-0 lead at half time,
and easily coasted through to vic
tory, although Sigma Nu garnered
11 points in the last period.
Fred Lindsley scored eight mark-
ers for the Phi Kaps, with his
teammate, Fred Coonradt, register-
ing 6. Lewis Lee and Howie Buller
scored seven of the loser's eleven
points.
Tie Unbroken
Delta Kappa Epsilon and the
Business School continued in a
deadlock for the leadership of
League IV, both squads winning by
default last night. Encina 2W for-
feited to the Dekes, while the El
Tigre five conceded victory to the
Business School. Albert Guerard,
manager of the Encina quintet,
stated that the frosh had decided
to attend Roble's invitational jolly-
up rather than compete in the
mural sport.
Buster Holmes refereed the Pa-
vilion game, while Pop Gabriel of-
ficiated in the gymnasium.
