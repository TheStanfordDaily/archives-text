# Hard Riding Indians To Meet Utah Four
## Gordan Will Shape Attack Around Fleming, Lewis; To Start At 2 P.M. 
### Bill Myers 
Boasting one of the best-balanced
teams in the history of Stanford
polo, the Card poloists will enter
tho two matches with Utah tomor
row with high hopes for a double
victory.
Until lately, the Indian riders have
been greatly handicapped by a
rain-soaked field which has made
1"; st scrimmaging impossible. The
turf has thoroughly dried out in the
last week, however, and the Ked
f hirts have made a rapid comeback
to their usual form.
Hard-Killing Outfit
A hard-riding, hard-hitting outfit,
the Card quartet will demonstrate
its worth to be classed as one of
tho foremost collegiate teams in the
West. Coached by Captain Dick
Gordan, recognized as one of the
nation's outstanding horsemen, the
Stanford team hus developed into
as flashy an aggregation as has ever
represented Stanford.
Lev/is and Fleming, who hold
down the three and four positions,
loom as the big Indian threats.
| Fleming, captain of the team, hits a
long bail and is the bulwark of the
defense. Lewis, who starred against
Arizona in spite of a pulled leg ten-
I don, is brilliant on offense and is a
big scoring threat against any com
! petition.
Spalding Back
Spalding, who returned to the
I team this winter after a quarter's
I ineligibility, fits in nicely at num
j ber one with his accurate goal
j shooting. His absence in games last
I fall was keenly felt. At number two,
! Gillham makes an excellent team
! mfm, besides being an elusive indi
vidual for the opposition to watch.
Both matches will be played on
j the highway field at 2 o'clock. There
: will be no admission charge.
Utah's line-up has not yet been
! announced.
Stanford line-up:
Spalding No. 1
Gillham No. 2
Lewis No. 3
Fleming (Capt.) No. 4
