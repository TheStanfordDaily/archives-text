# Freshman Nine In Second Tilt
## Yearlings Play Polytechnic Here Tomorrow 
### Bob Jones 
With a loss for the first game and
ragged practice for the last week j
behind them, the carefree Stanford '
freshman baseball team faces the 1
strong ball club from Polytechnic !
High School of San Francisco at 10
/clock tomorrow morning in the j
aid varsity ball park.
"I guess I'll have to start the first [
nine men who show up on the field ;
Saturday morning," remarked Coach
Murray Cuddeback yesterday when
lie learned a number of the squad !
are pulling out of camp before the '
game for holiday exploits.
Lineup Uncertain
Cuddeback is at a loss to selcct !
even a starting lineup to play the ;
powerful San Francisco nine in the j
second game of the frosh Reason, i
The majority of the players seem to .
have a care-free attitude toward ;
the game, not turning out regularly J
to practice and showing a lack of :
"fire."
Four men on the team, according j
to Cuddeback, are ball players; the |
lest are decidedly uncertain quanti
ties. Jim Woolley, Jim Kurtz, Fred
Heringer, and Jack Hosiner are the !
quartet who have shown some life I
so far.
Face Menlo Tuesday J
With another game scheduled for i
Tuesday with Menlo Junior College;
and not so much as a regular lineup j
to start, the week-end doesn't prom-j
i.se much success for the frosh.
The steady work of Heringer, j
Cuddeback's best moundsman, may !
win one of the two contests.
