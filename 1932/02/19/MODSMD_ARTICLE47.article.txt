Stanford's location is ideal for a
university, Dr. William T. Foster,
former president of Reed College at
Portland and friend of Dr. David
Stair Jordan, said yesterday. He
lias been visiting old friends on the
campus.
' Bankers and business men so
often work and play around in little
circles that it is good to get away
from the city and study the world
fiom a distance," he said. He in
sisted on being interviewed out in
(he sun, as he is soon to return to
the cold and smoke of the East.
Dr. Jordan was a frequent visitor
in Portland when Dr. Foster was
president of Reed College. On his
first visit the chancellor drew a cat
and wrote a verse in the guest book,
Dr. Foster related, and it became
the custom for Dr. Jordan on each
successive visit to add a verse and
a corresponding number of cats.
President Hoover's huge finance
corporation is a good thing, in Dr.
Foster's opinion, because it means
abandonment of the government's
hiissez-faire policy in business and
a concentration of effort instead of
so much individual effort. Dr. Fos
ter blames the continued weak con
dition of business to lack of confi
dence of the American people, and
believes the pool will restor confi
dence.
