# DRAMA PRODUCTION CHANGED TO SINGLE SET BY HELVENSTON
## 
### 
Saki was evidently not thinking
of Ihe impoverished amateur thea
tre when he wrote the "Mistress of
Briony"â€”at any rate Harold Hel
vo list on has found it possible to
change the so-called comedy from
an elaborate two-set production to
a simple one-set play by merely
changing one line in the third act.
I( seems that, the script calls for
two acts to be laid in the great hall
of Briony and the third to take
place in a breakfast room. All the
changing that is needed to account
for the family having breakfast in
the formal part of the house is to
have Ludavic state in the third act
that, the morning room is being re
papered.
Besides saving the dramatic coun
cil a good deal of money, this
change will give Frederick Stover,
who is in charge of juggling scenery
backstage, more time to work on
hi.s part in the actual show.
