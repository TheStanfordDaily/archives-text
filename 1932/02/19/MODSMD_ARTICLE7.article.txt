# THIRD VOTE ON SOPH PRESIDENT WILL BE HELD NEXT TUESDAY
## 
### 
The third time is supposed to be
I the crucial one, according to an
â€¢ adage dating back to some time or
I other.
One of those third times comes
i around Tuesday, when another at
j tempt will be made to elect a
i president for the Class of 1934.
At the "regular" election on Feb-
J ruary 9, 8 out. of 18 offices were
| filled. This left 10 for a revote last
Tuesday. Nine were taken care of
j at that time, and one remained for
I another revote. In the first election,
| the candidates for the sophomore
! presidency failed to secure a ma
| jority. In the second, they tied.
Thus Beverly C. Robinson and his
! Election Board assistants must hold
! ;i third election Tuesday, this time
i for one office. Dick Miles and Gene
| Brown are the candidates. Incident
| ally, Robinson cautions voters to
| mark their ballots plainly, and in
ink only, in order that the number
| of discarded ballots may be reduced.
