# INDIAN CAGERS IN LAST STAND AGAINST DEARS
## Third Big Series Tilt Sees Crippled Card Team Battling U.C. 
### Dick Rodda 
The 1932 Indian basketball team
will make its last attempt to stop
the attack of the Golden Bear to
morrow night in the Stanford Pa
vilion in the final game of a some
what disastrous cage season, as far
as the Cardinals are concerned.
Handicapped by injuries in nearly
every game they have played, the
Indian hoopsters have desperately
fought to keep themselves in the
tunning, but they have fought
against odds which have resulted in
eight straight conference losses.
Starting Linc-up
To open the final game of the
Big Series, Coach John Bunn will
use a five composed of Packard,
Cc'Sgrove, Cordry, Norgard, and
Tod. From the results of a game
with the frosh last Tuesday and
two hard-fought scrimmages on the
next two days, this quintet proved
to be the best available for the
closing contest.
Two of the positions were not
settled until last night. It was not
certain that Dave Packard would
start in the pivot position, but yes
terday in a short scrimmage with
the Grays the sophomore giant was
all over the court scoring more than
half of the points made by the var
sity. Packard took advantage of his
height to make nearly all of his set
up shots count.
Tod at Guard
The other position settled was one
of the guard berths. Edelen, Tod,
and Baker battled all week for the
position but last night Bunn de
cided that Jay Tod had shown the
most improvement.
With Packard at his best andwilh
Cosgrove much improved after hav
ing been shifted back from guard
to forward, the Indians should put
up a scrap that will make their last
grme well worth seeing. In ihe
Oakland fracas the Cards especially
missed the services of A1 Norgard
to prevent the Bear forwards from
getting under the basket. But Nor
gard's ankle has almost entirely
healed.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry will un
doubtedly give his usual perform
ance of wide-awake floorwork
against the Bears tomorrow. Cordry
seems to have more fight than any
man on the squad.

eight straight conference losses.
Starting Linc-up
To open the final game of the
Big Series, Coach John Bunn will
use a five composed of Packard,
Cc'Sgrove, Cordry, Norgard, and
Tod. From the results of a game
with the frosh last Tuesday and
two hard-fought scrimmages on the
next two days, this quintet proved
to be the best available for the
closing contest.
Two of the positions were not
settled until last night. It was not
certain that Dave Packard would
start in the pivot position, but yes
terday in a short scrimmage with
the Grays the sophomore giant was
all over the court scoring more than
half of the points made by the var
sity. Packard took advantage of his
height to make nearly all of his set
up shots count.
Tod at Guard
The other position settled was one
of the guard berths. Edelen, Tod,
and Baker battled all week for the
position but last night Bunn de
cided that Jay Tod had shown the
most improvement.
With Packard at his best andwilh
Cosgrove much improved after hav
ing been shifted back from guard
to forward, the Indians should put
up a scrap that will make their last
grme well worth seeing. In ihe
Oakland fracas the Cards especially
missed the services of A1 Norgard
to prevent the Bear forwards from
getting under the basket. But Nor
gard's ankle has almost entirely
healed.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry will un
doubtedly give his usual perform
ance of wide-awake floorwork
against the Bears tomorrow. Cordry
seems to have more fight than any
man on the squad.
