# WORLD AFFAIRS WILL HIGHLIGHT SOCIALIST TALK
## Steffens, Noted Liberal, Speaks At Assembly Hall Tonight 
### Mary Della Callahan 
Dj\ Lincoln Steffens, noted liberal
writer and lecturer, will speak to
night ut 7:30 o'clock in the Assem
bly Hall on "Changing One's Mind."
His associations with national and
international figures and events
which have led to a change of his
ideas concerning world affairs will
be the subject of the address.
Acquaintance with public men in
America and abroad through his
work as a journalist and investi
galor has prepared Dr. Steffens to'
give a vivid record of his experi
ences and opinions on world affairs.
As a journalist., he has had numer
ous opportunities to see the inside
of the most important government
situations of the last 25 years.
"Qualified Liberal"
Self-termed a qualified liberal,
Steffens has commended Russia for
her policy of action, and contrasted
it to the liberal policy of America,
which sponsors, he contends, pas
sive measures. An entire upheaval
of social and economic standards,
ho believes, is the most likely way
of reform. This American policy,
StefTens has publicly stated, led the
world to war and its aftermath,
corruption and economic slump.
Steffens is a native Californian,
having been born in San Francisco,
and attended school in Sacramento
and San Mateo. He is a graduate of
the University of California, and
studied at several European uni
versities, including Berlin, Heidel
berg, Leipzig, the Sorbonne, and
Paris, before entering journalistic
work.
Liberal writer, war correspond- I
cnt, and journalist, Dr. Steffens has '
been closely associated with politi- j
cal events and personages for the
past 25. years. In his lecture he will I
describe the factors which have
caused him to change his ideas on
world matters, illustrating the talk
by his experiences in public life for
the last quarter of a century.
Steffens' convictions of public
morality were strikingly illustrated
in one of the most startling political
exposure in history, when, through
his newspaper work, he was instru
mental in investigating municipal
graft early in the century, and in
scouring consequent reform in city
politics.
According to his own account in '
his recently published autobiogra- j
phy, Steffens' work is not limited i
to journalism and politics, but his I
interest is largely in moral prin- |
ciples.
