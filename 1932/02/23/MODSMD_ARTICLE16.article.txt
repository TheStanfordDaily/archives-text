# Steffens Expression Of Present Society-LaPiere
## 
### Bv HARRY McMASTERS 
"Lincoln Steffens is an expression
! of contemporary society," Richard
| T. LaPiere, instructor in sociology, i
j said yesterday. "He has reflected'
! the play of the diverse social forces
i so common to our present society.
; "His life, as indicated by his
( biography, has apparently been a
conflict between his high ideals and
! the gross reality which he dis
i covered in the world about him." I
Steffens has searched in vain for j
faitb in the future of humanity, like j
j al! minds freed from the stultifying j
I effects of conventionality, according ]
! to LaPiere. Contemporary society !
! has denied him this faith, he said.
Steffens is famous for his activi- i
| ties in the "muck-raking" era of j
| American life. He tells in his auto- I
biography how he investigated the
j government of city after city, hop- I

j ing to find the same corruption, the
same rule of the "boss," the same
! compromise of the law with crime,
and at last he concluded that all
j society was alike.
His discoveries, while they i
, rroused much public feeling at the t
time, did little but to discourage j
Steffens, LaPiere said. Society be- j
came tolerant again, and the bosses |
j continued to rule.
| Steffens is not a radical, as con- |
| scrvalives have charged. "He is a :
j liberal," said LaPiere, "but he is too j
j much a realist to have the faith j
' necessary to be a radical." 1
LaPiere believes that everyone (~
| will benefit from Steffens' lecture
; tonight, both those who believe this 1
I ijj the best of all possible worlds 1
1 and those who don't but would like '
1 to reform it.
