# Chinese Resistance Halts Jap Assault On Kiangwan Front
## Naval Comittee Urges U.S. to Build Up Adequate Defense; New Japanese Attack Held Imminent As War Party Sweeps Tokyo Elections

SHANGHAI, Feb. 23.—(AP)—Rebuffed in every on
slaught they have made on the center of the Chinese line at
Kiangwan, the Japanese today flung their full strength at
the Chinese positions on both sides of the village in an at
tempt to complete a surrounding movement and starve out
the handful of defenders still stationed in Kiangwan's blasted
ruins.
The Japanese launched vicious attacks—one to the north
west of the village and the other to the south—just as dawn
broke.
They used tanks, armored cars, infantry, airplanes and
field artillery. The base for this operation was the Kiangwan
racetrack and golf course, where weather-beaten signs, put
there to keep hunters away, warned in English and Chinese:
"No Shooting Allowed."

Fear Huge Death Toll
The Japanese command explained
that the purpose of the surrounding !
movement was to avoid excessive j
casualties, among their own troops |
as well as among the Chinese
manning machine guns behind i
Kiagnwan's walls, but the thorough- 1
ness of the Japanese artillery prep- |
arations and the intense machine
gun fire laid down by. the Chinese ,
when the assault line appeared, 'n- :
dicated that cacsualties would be
enormous.
The first objective of the assault .
apparently was the village of Mo i
Hang Chen two miles northwest of j
Kiangwan, where, according to the
Chinese version of Monday's action, !
a Japanese attacking unit was led 1
into ambush and cut down by ma
chines gunners and riflemen.
Chapci Shelled Again
While the major act'on was going
on in the vicinity of Kiangwan, the
ruins of Chapei were turned over 1
by another heavy bombardment j
during which numerous fires started, !
The Chinese got a head start in !
today's action by laying down on
Hongkew and the Japanese consul- j
ate in Shanghai the heaviest bom- j
bardment they have put on since j
the battle started four days ago.
An offic'al Japanese spokesman 1
admitted the Chinese still were in j
control of Kiangwan and said a j
strong body of troops was en- [
trenched there. This spokesman de- 1
clared the Japanese attackers got
ahead of their schedule in their as
sault on Kiangwan, a position the
high command did not intend to at- '
tack too strongly in order that cas- I
ualties on both sides m'ght be kept j
down.
The Chinese version of the action
around Kiangwan was considerably
different. It gave the Chinese com
mand credit for having executed a
smart movement. The Chinese con
tended that when the Japanese
turned their flank they quietly \
withdrew, allowing the attackers to j
walk into a pockct«in the village of j
Mo Hang Chen, two miles north- j
west of Kiangwan, where machine '
gunners and riflemen swept them i
with bullets.
