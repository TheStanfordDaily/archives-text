VALLEY FORGE, Pa., Feb. 22 (/P)
| â€”On the historic camp ground of
Valley Forge, General Pershing to
day, across the long span of years,
hailed General George Washington
as "the great commander."
Facing 9000 Boy Scouts and pos
; sibly 10,000 other persons, the most
1 recent victorious military chieftain
of the United States addressed him
self to the spirit of the country's
i first army commander.
"With our mind's eye," said the
' chief of the American Expeditionary
| Forces in the World War, "we can
; picture the stalwart figure of the
j groat commander as he moved
about this camp, the idol of his
| loyal troops. Make no mistake, he
j was a great commander. We have
only to look around us to obtain
some measure of his ability as a.
soldier.
"Valley Forge is an outstanding
example of a carefully selected
military position. The troops
I camped in this valley were sheltered
fi om the winds of winter and. more
important still, from the observa
tion of the enemy. The slopes of the
surrounding hills were ideal for
defense against the weapons and
methods of the eighteenth century."
