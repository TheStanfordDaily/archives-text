### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â€”(/ I-
V James Cannon, Jr., was
challenged again today by Repre
sentative Tinkham (Republican
Mass.), to proceed with a court trial
of Iho clergyman's $500,000 libel suit
against him.
Tinkham said the Southern Meth
odist churchman had "filled the
country with libel suits" and added:
"How can anyone expect that he
will dare to try these suits?"
In the House last Thursday Tink
ham challenged Bishop Cannon to
;in open court trial. Sunday the
clergyman issued a statement calling
him a cautious coward" in public
utterances where he can be held re
sponsible to the courts.
