# SCRAPE OFF THE MOSS

Aii editorial printed in the Daily Illini, student news
paper of the I'niversity of Illinois, praises the general
movement in colleges throughout the country to reform the
systems of student government.
The editorial runs in part: "College students are setting
up the framework of government systems which are ade
quate and capable of satisfying the many needs of the
present day student. In the larger colleges and universities,
llie student senate and council systems are being inaugu
rated to replace the old free-for-all but open-to-nonc class
ollicer system.
"The reform activities at these large schools in the
Midwest are illustrative of the movement which is in force
in nearly every college. The new and healthier student
governments which are bound to grow up will probably
be paralleled by a development of student interest in local,
slate, and national government as well. If such an interest
can be fos!r'cd in model student governments, they will
be well worth the effort which students are now putting
into the reformation."
It is apparent that Stanford is not included in this cate
gory of progressive schools that are attempting to improve
their student government. It is true that the most impor
tant affairs of the student body are managed under the
council system. Hut there still remains that moth-eaten
tradition of class ollicers. Traditions are all right in their
way, but when one clutters up the none-too-satisfactory
election system for the sole purpose of filling a lot of
worthless ollices with students whose only duly is to pose
for their pictures in the Quad, it is time it was abolished.
Nor is there the slightest vestige of honor connected with
such an olliee, as is the case in high school. If there were,
there might be a feeble reason for maintaining the farcical
positions.
Last year the D wi.v tried several times to push a reso
lution through K.\ committee, providing the elimination
of all class ollices except that of president. The one ollicer
could easily, with the aid of committees, accomplish all
that has to be done and, perhaps, the olliee would then
amount to something. However, the Ex committee de
feated the measure each time by a bare majority vote.
The Committee now has a different personnel. Will it
eliminate this useless hangover from high school days?
