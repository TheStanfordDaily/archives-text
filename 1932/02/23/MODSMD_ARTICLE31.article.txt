# A
						GOOD BEGINNING
## 
### 
Hy ils firm action lnsl week in handling the latest Honor j
(lode violation. Men's Council provided a good example I
with which to launch ils new "lour year plan" of enforce-!
mcnt. If the freshman class is to take a serious view of the j
enforcement program which has been laid out, it must be j
shown that the student bodv's oflicials are also taking a j
serious stand in upholding the code.
Last week's case, involving as it did a senior within one j
quarter of graduation, offered a possibility of lenient treat
ment, but the unhesitating imposition of a severe penalty
may be taken as an indication that the council expects hon-1
orable conduct from all classes and does not intend to j
leave support of tlie code up to the newly organized fresh
men.
However, a good beginning does not necessarily guar
antee the eventual results. I! is a long time between 19,T2
and 1 with much remaining to be done if the senior
year of the present frosli is to see complete acceptance of i
the system. Among other things, there is the question of I
transfer students, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate.
So far nothing seems to have been done toward establish
ing respect for the Honor ('.ode in their ranks, yet such
steps must be initiated to make the enforcement plan]
(omplete.
Transfers make up a large proportion of the student
body. Their numbers are increasing every year, and, de
spite the retention of the Lower Division, they are likely to
continue on the increase.
In view of these facts, along with the natural uncer
tainly as lo the ability of the freshmen to carry to comple
tion their ecnl undertakings, the campus is not yet in a
position lo sit back w ill) the idea thai the troublesome I
Honor (lode question lias at last been settled. A continued
policy of watchful wailing without a binding commit-1
nicnt of itself is the course logically indicated for campus
opinion.
All the members of Hie edil staff of the Daii.v will col
lect in ils spacious ollices today at 1: I ."> o'clock to sop up
whatever pearls of wisdom may drop from the lips of;
the powers above.
