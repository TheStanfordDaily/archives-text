# BULL SESSION
## THE 						OLD ORDER IS SAVED 
### 
Culminating a cat and dog light I
of many years, a long-disputed 1
question has been laid to rest —and i
the Lower Division emerges vietori- j
ous and triumphant. Many are in- j
deed happy—especially those who |
have continually advocated the idea J
of maintaining Stanford as a four
yc-ar University for undergraduates.
But while most of us are dancing
our victory march let us not forget |
those disappointed souls who have j
with equal fire —and probably with
more vitrol—been extolling the Jun- !
ior College and the abolition of the
Lower Division.
Stanford has been saved for those ;
who come to college for an eduea- j
ticn—and not to write dry, musty i
"papers" to be bound in red cloth, j
stacked on shelves—there to collect j
dust and cobwebs unread and un- j
touched. It has been saved from the !
dampening clutches of the special- !
ist; and given over to the rest of i
us. It has been saved from becom- i
ing a graduate seminar; it remains I
a place where we may LIVE for j
four years as well as study for four j
years.
It had always seemed regrettable |
that intelligent high-school gradu- 1
ates should have been barred from |
the Farm to make room for Junior j
College students who could muster i
a "C" average. Intelligence is the j
basic factor in determining the cali- i
ber of a college student; and in most i
cases intelligence was discriminated I

I against in the system that had been
I cramping Stanford's style and the
i system that seemed to be destined
|to sometime rule triumphant and
I universal.

| The enrollment of the education
department will probably decrease
I as the Lower Division is increased;
| the number of high-school teachers
! produced will probably be decided
-1 ly less. But aside from this, nothing
I else will be lost. The Stanford that
war; and the Stanford that is; con
| tinues to be the Stanford that will
i be. The Winds of Freedom will con
tinue to blow; the liberal institu
! tier that Leland Stanford founded
| and David Starr Jordan realized
I will continue to be a benevolent
j vortex for students desiring a lib
j eral education.

I But while we are rejoicing—and
I thifc Bull Session is an emotional
! reaction —we must not fail to see
| the ugly cloud that hangs over the
! change. The enlarged freshman
| class should not mean a proportion-
I al increase in athletic ballyhoo. If
I we allow a larger Lower Division to
I pervert our educational standard,
j then it would have been better if
I no change were ever made. There
j is no need, however, for this taking
| place. —Abe Mellinkoff.
