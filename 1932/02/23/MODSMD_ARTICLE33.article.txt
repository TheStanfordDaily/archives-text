"We'll beat the Japs!" »
This statement by D. S. Fong, !
| manager of the Great China Theatre
J in San Franciscso, typifies the spirit j
i of the largest Chinese colony out- 1
j side of China.
Fong, whose theatre Sunday night j
I witnessed a spirited demonstration
j of Chinese aroused by Japan's at-
I tack on Shanghai, is vitally con
! cerned over the outcome of the '
! Far-Eastern struggle.
"The students of China are sacri-
I ficing themselves for a new nation
alism," said Fong. A graduate of
j Lingnan University in Canton, j
: China, the San Francisco oriental
j stated that 250 undergraduates from I
j his alma mater dropped their j
studies to become cadets and of- j
ficcrs in China's army defending ;
Shanghai.
"Many of these boys will die," I
*sid Fong. "Some of them have !
; cabled farewells to relatives in San
Francisco. But China will surprise '
I the world. The new nationalistic
spirit is shown by the support of ,
i the Cantonese, thousands of whom,
| have joined the armies of the north :
I against a common enemy." /

According to Fong, the campaign j
in Chinatown to raise money for j
China's defense has met with un- 1
qualified success. "Over $500,000 of |
the $1,000,000 to be raised by the j
San Francisco colony has already
been sent through Chinese banks to !
the general in command at Shang- j
hai," said Fong. '"The family of one ,
prominent Chinese merchant con
tiibuted $200,000. The women and |
girls are working to get Red Cross j
supplies for the troops."
Tsz Pan Wong, secretary of the 1
Chinese Benevolent Society, which !
is the central organization of all the j
Chinese in America, explained that i
although the Japanese have blocked j
the sea entrance to Shanghai, arms
and war supplies may be trans- •
ported overland to China's war |
hosts.
