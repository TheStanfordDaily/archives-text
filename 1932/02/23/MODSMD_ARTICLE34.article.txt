# FROSH WATER POLO FIVE KEEP 16-YEAR JINX OVER SEQUOIA
## 
### 
Unable to find strength enough
| Friday to break the old 16-year
jinx, Sequoia High School again
| failed to take the unbeaten fresh-
I men at water polo. This time the
j score was even more decisive than
| two weeks ago, the game ending at
9-5. Six to four was the first game
count.
Showing even more fight and
teamwork than usual, the babes
I piled up a 9-1 lead in the first half
| and held it up to the last three
| minutes of play. At this point As
| sistant Coach Thornton put in his
j tecond team. Sequoia smashed in
| four goals in quick succession in the
jne xt two minutes, whereupon
I Thornton again stuck the first team
! men into the pool to hold the count
j down.
Triolo, Taranik, Benet, Boothe,
j Hirsch, Fitting, and Cook made up
i the first team, with Brockmeier,
Rogers, Roedel, Nichols, and Jurs,
together with Boothe and Cook, as
the second-string outfit. There were
no individual stars in the Stanford
end of the pool, with Worrel by far
the most outstanding player for the
invaders, scoring all five of the
losers' goals.
