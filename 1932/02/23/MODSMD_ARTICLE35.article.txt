# WOMEN DEBATERS TO ATTACK NEVADA DIVORCE THURSDAY
## 
### 
Nevada's divorce laws will be the
subject of a debate in which the
women's varsity debate team will
meet a visiting team from Oregon
State College on Thursday evening
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theatre.
Stanford will be represented by
Marian Harper and Mary Rechif.
Both are transfers who have had
debating experience before coming
to the Farm, although neither has
represented the Cardinal in foren
sic endeavor before.
The local women, upholding the
affirmative side of the question,
"Resolved, That the divorce laws of
the State of Nevada should be con
demned," will denounce the divorce
practices of California's neighbor
state as "lax."
So sensitive is nitrogen iodine,
one of the world's most "touchy"
explosives, that it will "go off" when
touched by a feather.
