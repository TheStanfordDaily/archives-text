A WOMAN COMMANDS—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Pola Negri was ono of the finest
of emotional actresses in the good ■
old days of silents (requiescat in !
pacem) but the squawkies prove to
be an even better medium for her
talent, by reason of a very com
pelling voice. Pola is really a very •
startling actress. Her face in repose j
is almost that of the most unsophis- .
ticated "collitch co-ed" but she has |
complete control over her expres- j
sions and makes the most of every |
conceivable emotion. Her physical !
poise and the modulations of her j
voice put the best of her rival stars j
to shame. And above all, she can j
sing and does. Any sort of trite plot j
would be worth sitting through just :
to hear her do that.
But the picture provides almost a j
surfeit of good things for the plot j
is not too trite. It is the story of the i
king of some "Ruritanian" kingdom, j
played by Roland Young with a fin- .
ished excellence, who falls deeply 1
in love with the dancer, Pola, and !
finds that she will not surrender j
without the rites of marriage. Na- j
turally she becomes queen, much j
to the disgust of her guardsman j
ex-lover, Basil Rathbone, of whom j
nolhing' good can be said except |
that he does sneer amazingly well, j
Plot and counterplot follow with a i
final revolution but all is well after j
a fine dramatic finale.
Shorts—far above average.
