IT WAS a thrill while it lasted,
ihnt inspired stand of Coach John
Bunn's Indian cagers Saturday
night.
With the campus deserted for the
week-end, the smallest crowd of the
season turned out expecting to see
a rout. But during the first half,
the 1500 or so of the faithful were
first unbelieving, then wildly hope
ful. The tiny California rooting
section pleaded with the Golden in
vaders, but it was no use.
After getting a 4 to 3 lead in
the opening minutes, the In
dians were never headed dur
ing that first period. Several
times they were tied, but al
ways they came back to take
the lead again.
Stanford's defense showed great
improvement, being the best seen
since injuries first began taking
their early season toll. It was only
by resorting to long-range shots
that the Boars finally pulled away.
<§>
SEVERAL SPECTACULAR plays
were registered by the Indians in
ihe game. With the score tied at
six-all, Cosgrove looped in a beau
tiful long shot although hardly tak
ing time I i get his hands on the
gall. He had 110 time to get set, but
look a swift pass and let fly at the
basket oyer the upraised hands of
Kintana. The ball didn't so much
as touch the rim as it swished
through.
Kintana again tied up pro
ceedings with a hole shot, lint
Tod matched it with a long
sprint down the floor after in
tercepting the ball in mid
court. A California guard was
hanging on bis shoulder all the
way, but Tod .got the basket.
Cordry scored the last field goals
for Stanford, both beauties. A long
one from the side thrilled the crowd
near the end of the first period and
made the score 14 to 10, while the
final one was a hole shot made
after an extremely long pass from
Tod.
WELL, IT's all over as far as
Stanford is concerned, and Farm
fans will breathe a sigh of I'elief.
Between injuries, illness, and leaves
of absence, the season that prom
ised so much has been a great dis
appointment.
Starting out with two great
victories over a strong U.C.L.A.
team, the Indians looked like
they might go places—not as far
as the championship, perhaps,
but reasonably high up. Then
came the "breaks," which need
no reviewing here.
The Trojans aroused the emnity
of the coast with their stalling tac
tics—but it furnished interesting
copy for the newspapers, at least.

here to watch the Navy's great pride
Akron gracefully into the skies
to prove its airworthiness, saw it
damaged in a gust of wind today
and endanger a large crowd of spec

poised for a takeoff.

made the score 14 to 10, while the
final one was a hole shot made
after an extremely long pass from
Tod.
WELL, IT's all over as far as
Stanford is concerned, and Farm
fans will breathe a sigh of I'elief.
Between injuries, illness, and leaves
of absence, the season that prom
ised so much has been a great dis
appointment.
Starting out with two great
victories over a strong U.C.L.A.
team, the Indians looked like
they might go places—not as far
as the championship, perhaps,
but reasonably high up. Then
came the "breaks," which need
no reviewing here.
The Trojans aroused the emnity
of the coast with their stalling tac
tics—but it furnished interesting
copy for the newspapers, at least.
LAKEHURST, N.J., Feb. 22.—
f/P) — A committee of congressmen,
here to watch the Navy's great pride
Akron gracefully into the skies
to prove its airworthiness, saw it
damaged in a gust of wind today
and endanger a large crowd of spec
tators before it could even get
poised for a takeoff.
IT WAS a thrill while it lasted,
ihnt inspired stand of Coach John
Bunn's Indian cagers Saturday
night.
With the campus deserted for the
week-end, the smallest crowd of the
season turned out expecting to see
a rout. But during the first half,
the 1500 or so of the faithful were
first unbelieving, then wildly hope
ful. The tiny California rooting
section pleaded with the Golden in
vaders, but it was no use.
After getting a 4 to 3 lead in
the opening minutes, the In
dians were never headed dur
ing that first period. Several
times they were tied, but al
ways they came back to take
the lead again.
Stanford's defense showed great
improvement, being the best seen
since injuries first began taking
their early season toll. It was only
by resorting to long-range shots
that the Boars finally pulled away.
<§>
SEVERAL SPECTACULAR plays
were registered by the Indians in
ihe game. With the score tied at
six-all, Cosgrove looped in a beau
tiful long shot although hardly tak
ing time I i get his hands on the
gall. He had 110 time to get set, but
look a swift pass and let fly at the
basket oyer the upraised hands of
Kintana. The ball didn't so much
as touch the rim as it swished
through.
Kintana again tied up pro
ceedings with a hole shot, lint
Tod matched it with a long
sprint down the floor after in
tercepting the ball in mid
court. A California guard was
hanging on bis shoulder all the
way, but Tod .got the basket.
Cordry scored the last field goals
for Stanford, both beauties. A long
one from the side thrilled the crowd
near the end of the first period and
made the score 14 to 10, while the
final one was a hole shot made
after an extremely long pass from
Tod.
