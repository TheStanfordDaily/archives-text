## CARDS IN CELLAR AS BEAR QUINTET DEADLOCKS TROY Bruins Save Day For U.C. With Two Wins Over Superior Trojans 
### Lowell Cox 
Greater power finally asserting
itself in the last half at the Stanford
Pavilion Saturday night—
A desperate second-half rally al
Los Angeles—
A coin that came up "tails" in
stead of "heads"—
And the Bears and Trojans will
fight it out for the southern divi
sion basketball championship at the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday night
in their fifth meeting of the year.
Just a reminder about this Oak
land affair—step right up and get
your tickets now, or you will be on
the outside trying to look in at the
classic of the basketball season.
U.C.L.A. Saved Bears
The Trojans beat the Bears three
out of four times this season, but
thanks to the U.C.L.A. Bruins, who
came through with two much
needed victories over their cross
city rivals, the Berkeley cagers end
ed the regular season Saturday
night in a tie with U.S.C. At a con
ference between officials of the two
institutions it was decided that one
game should settle the matter, ana
the flip of a coin fixed the scene of
battle as Oakland.
Stanford made a surprisingly
strong showing in the final game of
ihe California series here Saturday
night, nearly wrecking the Bear
apple cart. A combination consist
ing of Cordry and Cosgrove, for
wards; Packard, center, and Tod and
Norgard, guards, had the Bears on
the defensive throughout the first
half, ending the period on the long
end of a 14 to 11 count.
After the rest period Cordry took
a long pass from Tod for a hole shot,
and Stanford was five points ahead.
But that marked the end of the
Indians' bid for glory. The Bunn
team had been playing over its
head, and the Stanford attack col
lapsed when the Berkeley five fin
ally got down to business. The final
score was 29 to 18.
Meanwhile, down at Los Angeles,
the Trojans finally defeated the
Bruins to tie with the Bears. The
U.C.L.A. five held a big lead at
half time, but a rally, born of des
peration brought them a close 35
to 31 victory in the second half.

the defensive throughout the first
half, ending the period on the long
end of a 14 to 11 count.
After the rest period Cordry took
a long pass from Tod for a hole shot,
and Stanford was five points ahead.
But that marked the end of the
Indians' bid for glory. The Bunn
team had been playing over its
head, and the Stanford attack col
lapsed when the Berkeley five fin
ally got down to business. The final
score was 29 to 18.
Meanwhile, down at Los Angeles,
the Trojans finally defeated the
Bruins to tie with the Bears. The
U.C.L.A. five held a big lead at
half time, but a rally, born of des
peration brought them a close 35
to 31 victory in the second half.
Season Standings: Won Lost
California 8 3
Southern California 8 3
U.C.L.A 4 7
Stanford 2 9
Greater power finally asserting
itself in the last half at the Stanford
Pavilion Saturday night—
A desperate second-half rally al
Los Angeles—
A coin that came up "tails" in
stead of "heads"—
And the Bears and Trojans will
fight it out for the southern divi
sion basketball championship at the
Oakland Auditorium Saturday night
in their fifth meeting of the year.
Just a reminder about this Oak
land affair—step right up and get
your tickets now, or you will be on
the outside trying to look in at the
classic of the basketball season.
U.C.L.A. Saved Bears
The Trojans beat the Bears three
out of four times this season, but
thanks to the U.C.L.A. Bruins, who
came through with two much
needed victories over their cross
city rivals, the Berkeley cagers end
ed the regular season Saturday
night in a tie with U.S.C. At a con
ference between officials of the two
institutions it was decided that one
game should settle the matter, ana
the flip of a coin fixed the scene of
battle as Oakland.
Stanford made a surprisingly
strong showing in the final game of
ihe California series here Saturday
night, nearly wrecking the Bear
apple cart. A combination consist
ing of Cordry and Cosgrove, for
wards; Packard, center, and Tod and
Norgard, guards, had the Bears on
the defensive throughout the first
half, ending the period on the long
end of a 14 to 11 count.
