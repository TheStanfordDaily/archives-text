# Varied Contests Give Card Teams Hectic Week-End
## 
### 
All was not quiet on the sports j
front.
{ I
The interclass track meet opened j
i the hostilities. Big Ben Eastman j
! featured for the Juniors, enabling j
j them to capture the laurels from the |
j favored Senior aggregation. Satur- j
l day morning dawned with the Poly- j
I technic High School of San Fran- j
I cisco drubbing the yearling nine G !
| to 4. But that afternoon Coach Wol- ;
| tei's nine sent the meandering
Mcragans back to St. Mary's riurs- j
in# a 9-3 trimming. While over on !
the polo grounds, the Gordan- j
coached quartet greeted Utah by ,
flashing to an 8-3 count.
In the curtain-raiser Saturday |
night, the babe hoop five suddenly
came to life, played heads-up ball,
J and ended their season looking like
a basketball team. Then Nibs Price
had the scare of his life when Tiny
Tim Cordry and his teammates led |
the conference-leading Bears at
half-time. After the rest period, j
however, Kintana, Vendt, and Co., !
I pulled away from the quickly tiring I
Cards to win, 29-18.
Ellsworth Vines, national net
champion, proved too much for !
j Keith Gledhill, Card tennis captain, i
j Sunday, winning 0-3 and 6-1. In- j
dian poloists made it two straight
over the invading Utah four yes- |
terday as the second team piled up i
ten points to the Mormons' lone I
tally.
