# FARM BOXING TEAM FAVORED OVER U.C.
## Indians Will Meet Bears In Oakland Tomorrow 
### 
I Prospects of a Stanford victory •
j over California boxers were bright- '
i ened considerably when the Cal !
Aggies defeated the Bears by six j
bouts to one last Friday night.
Indian fighters beat the Davis i
Farmers by four bouts to three two |
, weeks ago and should have no
i trouble in winning over U.C. The
j iwr teams meet Thursday night at
| 8 o'clock in the Oakland Audi-
I tori urn.
The only Bear fighter to take a !
I bout was Captain Earl Stevens,
j lightweight. He won a close deci
' sion over Lindsey Jewett, who de- '
| feated Ben Mathews of the Card
j varsity.
The Indians took last week off
and should be in fine shape to meet '
. the Californians. They spent the 1
time sparring with Coach Harry
! Maloney and his assistants and
I nearly all of them show improve
j ment. Many of the rough spots
i which showed up in the Aggie
; matches have been smoothed off.
j Maloney plans to announce to- i
j day the names of the fighters who
1 wiii meet the Bears.
