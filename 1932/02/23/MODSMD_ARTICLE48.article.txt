# CLAPP MAKES NEW SWIMMING RECORD
## Unofficial Mark Set In 300-Yard Medley 
### 
Adding another laurel to his col- j
j lection, Austin Clapp pushed him- !
I self through the water of the En- j
j cina pools Friday afternoon to a new j
unofficial National Intercollegiate j
; record in the 300-yard medley. I
; Paced by Bob Clark, Clapp finished |
!in 3 minutes, 48.1 seconds in the |
â€¢ long pool, a good three yards ahead i
i of Clark.
Starting off with the breast- j
| stroke, Clark's specialty, the two !
j "were about even for the entire j
hundred yards. Twisting into the i
I backstroke, Clapp found himself j
i gaining steadily, and held his lead i
| from then on. The final century, i
j free-style, saw him increase that j
| lead and pull in with the new rec- I
: ord at his heels. J
Harms, of Fordham, holds the old |
[ record of 3:51.2 made last year. |
i Clapp is National Intercollegiate i
| champion in the 220-yard free-style j
rnd national A.A.U. 500-yard cham- >
piort, as well as being a member of i
the world's championship 800-meter !
! relay team.
