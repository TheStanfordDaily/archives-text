# FRESHMAN TOSSERS FACE MENLO TODAY
## Must Live Down Week-end Loss To High School 
### 
With this afternoon's Menlo Jun- j
1 ior College game on the local dia- j
mond before them, the Stanford ,
freshman baseball team nurses a
! sciry G to 4 defeat inflicted last
j Saturday morning by the Polytech
| nic High School ball club, as they
I prepare to collect themselves today
| to retaliate for the second stinging '
! loss of the season suffered at the j
! hands of prep school batsmen.
The first, fifth, and ninth innings ,
1 were the bright spots in the game !
! for Stanford. First man up in the :
; first inning, Gordy Mallatratt, a last
i week's addition to the team, con- 1
j nected with a fast ball to clout it
j against the left field fence for a
j homer. On an error by the pitcher,
I "Dutch" Reuther, Jack Hosmer, who
I was walked early in the frame,
j scored the second run for the Babes.
Again, during the fifth inning,
I Mallatratt scored, this time on an
I error chalked against the second
i baseman. After clouting the ball for j
j a triple in the last half of the ninth j
i inning in a wild flourish by the frosh |
to at least tie the score, Avery i
1 scurried home when the fielder who 1
| retrieved his long hit heaved a wild
| ball to third in an attempt to nab j
! him.
