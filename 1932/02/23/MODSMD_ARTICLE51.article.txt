# Farm Poloists In 2 Utah Wins
## Pete Lewis Is Card Star; Second String Plays 
### 
Easily turning hack the invaders, |
the; Stanford polo team opened the j
spring season with a pair of do- I
cisive victories over tho University |
of Utah Saturday and yesterday, |
preparatory to its coming series I
with the Arizona four Thursday |
and Saturday of this week. The In- !
dian players left last night for j
Tuscon.
Saturday the Cardinals piled up i
an 8-3 score against the visitors, {
while yesterday's encounter saw j
Utah bow before the Stanford sec- i
ond team 10-1.
Coach Captain Gordan used his j
top-ranking four during the first j
thiee chukkers of the initial con-j
test, long enough to produce a sub- |
stantial lead for the local team, and !
then shot in his reserves, who were j
held on fairly even terms, but who i
managed to add a couple of goals |
to the total. Pete Lewis, No. 3, was 1
the most effective cog in the vie- i
torious Stanford attack. Spaulding, j
No. 1, Gilham, No. 2, and Fleming, !
back, made up the rest of the start- j
nig lineup.
Led by Ed Boyles at No. 2, Gor
dan's shock troops easily outclassed j
the Utahns in the final game. Stan
ford tallied in every period, Boyles
taking individual honors with 5
goals. Holt, No. 1, Malone, No. 3.
and Crawford, back, were the |
starters. Fleming, first string back, !
played for a short time.
