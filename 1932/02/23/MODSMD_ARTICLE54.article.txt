# EXPERTS DISCUSS LEAGUE'S POSITION IN ORIENTAL WAR
## Geneva Wields Only Moral Influence; No Resort To Armed Force 
### Elizabeth Paine 
Reasons why the League of Na
tions has not taken drastic steps to
prr vent the outbreak of war be
tween Japan and China were ad
vanced yesterday by campus ex
perts.
"Why doesn't Geneva stop Sino-
Japanese hostilities? She can't be
cause her power, like that of the
Honor Code, lies principally in the
moral force behind the League
Covenant," said Flaud C. Wooton
of the Department of Citizenship.
During the summers of 1929-30
Wooton was research clerk for the
Information Section of the League.
"The Covenant does not provide
for military punishment of nations
breaking the peace agreement. It
merely calls for an economic boy
cott in such cases," Wooton ex
plained. "To declare a boycott on
Japan would be a physical impos
sibility due to her geographical
situation. Russia, which is not a
member of the League, is close by,
and the United States, unbound by
European 'entangling alliances,' is
accessible across the Pacific."
In the opinion of Ernest B. Price,
former United States Consul at
Nanking and at present a graduate
student in the Department of Po
litical Science, the chief reason that
the League has been slow in inter
vening is that Japan and China have
not as yet severed diplomatic rela
tions with each other. Price added:
"Another cause for the apparent
lethargy of other nations in regard
to the crisis is that many of them
are as ready to land military forces
in China for the asserted purpose of
protecting their nationals as was
Japan."
