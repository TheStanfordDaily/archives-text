# TOMALA POTTERY OF OLD MEXICO SHOWN IN GALLERY EXHIBIT
## 
### 
!
A legend of old Mexico increases j
interest in a group of Tonala pot- >
tery included in the rare collec- i
tion of Mexican arts and crafts \
being shown in the Stanford Art i
Gallery.
When the Spanish conquerors j
came to Mexico it was the Tonala ;
Indians' skilled potters but doughty !
fighters, who halted them so defi
nitely that they were forced to :
make a treaty with Queen Juchapil, j
the white Indian woman who ruled I
Tonala.
The same Indians still live on the !
same hill of Tonala, seldom lifting j
their eyes from the pottery upon |
which they paint beautiful patterns.
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the
Museum and Art Gallery, made
the collection which includes the
Tonala pottery last summer while j
making a survey of the progress of
art education in Mexico at the in- j
vitation of the Mexican Secretary
of Education. The pottery and fur
niture exhibits are the finest in the
United States, Lemos believes.
In some parts of Scotland the
finding of a four-leaf clover denotes ;
bad instead of good luck.
