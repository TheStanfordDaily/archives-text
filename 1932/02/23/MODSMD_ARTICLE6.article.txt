# FROSH HOOPSTERS CLICK THROUGH, WIN YEAR'S LAST GAME
## 
### 
All's well that ends well!
The old axiom applies in full
measure to the much-defeated
Stanford freshman basketball team,
which hit its real stride in the last
week of the season and proved that
its fine showing against the varsity
was no flash in the pan by defeat
ing' Roseville High in the final game
of the year Saturday night. The
score was 29-12 after the first- and
second-string yearlings had run up |
a 2!)-4 lead with less than five min- j
utes to play. Coach Vance Fawcett -
then sent in the rest of his squad, j
and the prepsters connected with '
four long range shots against the I
reserves.
Roseville managed to hold the j
Indians to a 5-4 advantage at the ]
end of the first quarter, but from !
that time until Stafford's long shot i
stalled the high-school team's rally
late in the last period, the Stanford !
defense held Roseville completely in j
check. While the visitors were going j
scoreless, the yearlings made 11 j
baskets and 24 points.
Tom Sales, center, Henry and j
Charles Coiner, forwards, and Joe
Butte and Gordon Mallatratt, j
guards, started the game for Stan- j
ford. The yearling's best forward, |
Lory Rothert, saw the game from j
the stands as a result of a leg in- !
jury incurred in the frcshman-var- !
siiy game on Tuesday afternoon.
The other men who saw action were
Tom Kelly, Joe Griswold, and Vin
cent Meyer, centers; Frank Cox,
Jim Thompas, A1 Page, Jake Butts,
Howie Carr, and Don Bacon, for
wards; Jim Savage, Johnny Mack,
Wally Crowe, and Warren Braley,
guards. Frank Cox of the Indians
and Hunter of Roseville shared j
scoring honors with six points each, j
