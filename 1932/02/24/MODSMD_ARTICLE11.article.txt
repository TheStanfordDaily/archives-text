SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 23. (/P)â€”
Existence of a widespread conspir
acy to make San Francisco a trans
shipment point for eastbound rum,
brought here from British Colum
bia, is under investigation by Gov
ernment officials following the hi
jacking of 174 cases of smuggled
liquor at Seventeenth and Arkansas
streets Sunday.
Federal officials here believe re
cent events may precipitate a boot
leg war. Strained relations were
said to have resulted in November
when customs officials seized 700
cases of smuggled liquor on the
Embarcadero.
