rency, announced today that a cen
tralized office to market bonds of
suspended national banks had been
established in New York to aid in
getting the greatest return for the
assets of the closed banks.
The plan, Pole said, contemplated
bringing into New York the assets
of closed banks which have a mar
ket there and selling them from a
central office to secure the maxi

creditors and to prevent the pro- |
miscuous dumping of securities in
various parts of the country.
