# MOON ENTRANCES; STUDENTS DANCE ON GRAVE STEPS
## 
### 
Stanford students have
danced at Dinah's and even at
Encina, but late Sunday night
two freshmen established an
unheard-of precedent in Tcrp
sichorean history.
Cactus Garden habitues, in
vestigating strains of Phil Har
ris dance music floating on the
midnight air, discovered a pair
of engrossed freshmen tripping
the light fantastic on the steps
of the Mausoleum! The melody
came from the radio in their
car.
And the eery moonlight cli
maxed the weird paradox as
it cast dark, formless, splotchy
shadows across the faces of the
two grinning sphinxes which
stood guard over the dancers
on either hand.
