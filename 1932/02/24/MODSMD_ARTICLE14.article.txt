# DICTATORS BEST, CLAIMS LIBERAL
## Soviet Imitates U.S. To Gain Leisure Time 
### 
Appealing to American students to
apply scientific methods to business
and social problems, Lincoln Stcf
fens, liberal writer and lecturer,
spoke last night in the Assembly
Hall on "Changing One's Mind."
Definite training, he said, is nec
essary to condition thinkers to
change their minds. Knowledge of
facts means nothing, he contended,
but knowledge of the logical time
to keep an open mind must be bal
anced by the necessity to close one's
mind and act.
Claiming the stagnant conditions
in America to be the result of con
sistant devotion to the ideals of de
mocracy and liberalism, he argued
that Russia solved the problem by
turning the government over to mob
rule. Even in this purely democratic
group fear and over-conscientious
attitude caused division. Until the
bolsheviki established an extreme
dictatorship, no action took place.
The aim of Russia today, StefTens
said, is to secure what America has
unwittingly developed — universal
unemployment. "Russia does not
admire our liberty, democracy, or
justice; what she admires is our
machinery and methods—capital and
labor — which produce unemploy
ment and which eventually lead to
a system which balances produce
and demand."
The rule of Mussolini, he asserted,
illustrates the necessity of central
ized power directed by a policy of
action.
