# SENATE PASSES FULL-STRENGTH U.S. NAVY BILL
## Party Leaders Accept Act, Minus Appropriation, For Pact Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. (/Pi â€”
Mindful of the war in the Orient
and the Arms conference at Geneva,
the Senate Naval Committee today
voted for a navy as big and strpng
as the London Treaty will permit.
It approved a bill by Chairman
Hale to bring this about. Senator
Watson, the Republican leader,
promptly gave it his endorsement,
and indicated the measure would
receive early consideration.
The measure is a simple authori
zation and provides no appropria
tions. Hale estimated it would cost
$880,000,000 to bring the navy up
to the treaty strength in ten years.
House Hill Pends
A similar bill is pending before
the House Naval Committee, intx-o
duced by Chairman Vinson. The
committee approved it, but voted
not to seek enactment at present
because of the depleted condition of
the treasury.
Vinson said recently, however, if
the crisis in the Orient did not
{ bate, he would ask the committee
to place the measure before the
House. Watson, in indorsing the bill,
said it would strengthen the posi
tion of America's delegation at the
Disarmament conference.
"Chips For Game"
"It; will give our fellows over
there some chips to sit in the game,"
he said. "Republican leadership will
do all it can to put. the bill through."
Hale expressed a similar view,
saying the bill "would show that we
don't simply talk, but that if other
countries plan to build up to the
treaty strength, America will do the
same."
Democratic leaders would not
discuss the bill publicly, but pri
vately expressed the view it might
embarrass the delegation at Geneva.
They predicted its passage, how
ever.
