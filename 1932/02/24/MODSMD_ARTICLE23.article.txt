# Tigers Train On Stanford's New Sunken Diamond
## Changes Plans When Egan Compares Fields 
### 
Stanford University's sunken dia- j
mcmd instead of the Palo Alto i
municipal diamond will be the;
scene of the Detroit Baseball Club's j
spring training from February 29 !
to March 8, according to a joint an- j
nouncement of Alfred R. Masters, |
of the Board of Athletic Control, j
and the city officials of Palo Alto.
The Tigers had previously in
tended to use the El Camino Real
field, and the city fathers had al
ready spent $1750 on improvement j
with this in view. However, after |
Aloysius J. Egan, Detroit coach, had ]
looked over the campus field last j
Saturday he described it as "one j
of the best diamonds in the coun- J
try," and immediately began nego- \
tiations for its use.
Under the new arrangement, made '
possible by the co-operation of the ,
city council and the Stanford Board j
of Trustees, the Detroit squad of 35
players will have the use of the j
Stanford gymnasium and training i
facilities from February 29 to March !
8, and perhaps to March 18, the end j
of the regular training season, de- i
pending on the number of players j
taking part in the exhibition games 1
in Oakland and San Francisco.
The major league players will be!
off the field by 3 o'clock each after- |
noon, so as not to conflict with the i
practices of the Indian varsity base- i
ball team.
