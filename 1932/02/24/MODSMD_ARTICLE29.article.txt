WASHINGTON Feb. 23. (/P)â€”
Striking out vigorously at "degrad
ing" motion pictures, Senator Brook
hart of lowa today called upon the
Senate to investigate the entire in
dustry.
Revelations as startling as those
of the Teapot Dome oil scandal were
predicted by the Senator. He de
nounced Will H. Hays as a "smoke
screen." and charged the movies had
been "permitted by a supine Gov
ernment to be successfully monop
olized."
