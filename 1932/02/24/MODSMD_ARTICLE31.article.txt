# INDIAN NINE TO INVADE MORAGA DIAMOND TODAY
## Caddel Favored To Receive Mound Call Against Powerful Gaels INDIANS DEFEND CROWN Miles For Campbell If Bat Slump Continues 
### Bob Wade 
Having won the two conference
games played on their homo lot,
and with a loss to Santa Clara
marking their only venture away
from the Farm this season, Stan
ford' s varsity baseball team goes to
Moraga this afternoon bent on
hanging up another victory over St.
Mary's to offset their one defeat
in the race for the conference flag.
Coach Harry Wolter was anything
but satisfied with the showing the
team made against Earle's All-stars
in Monday's practice set-to, and as
a result will probably leave the
substitutes who got a chance Mon
day on the sidelines.
Moraga Field Rough
The Saints' field is not the best in
the league, and Wolter will start
Gordy Campbell in light field be
cause of experience, even though
he hasn't been able to hit his batting
stride this season.
Tlie line-up, as it looks from the
games played so far will be: Goodell
on first, Philippi at second, Traut
man holding down third, Delmas at
short, Goldmann in left field, Cap
tain Rudy Rintala in center, Camp
bell in right, and Livermore behind
the plate.
Caddcl May Piteli
Wolter will not announce his
pitcher until game time, but big
Ernie Caddel probably has the call.
Any of the four chuckers on the
team could start, but Stark and
Estes worked Monday, and Caddel
has been going better than Ander
son so far. Anderson came out of
Saturday's game with a win to his
credit, but he didn't look any too
impressive hanging it up. The soph
omore speed-burner gave the im
pression, at least in the first four
innings, of needing a lot more work
before he will look like the young
ster who was slated to fill Dan
Johnson's shoes.
Campbell is perhaps the best
fielder on the squad, and if he could
hii would be a cinch for the right
field berth, but the way he has
been missing them lately he is
likely to be watching a sophomore
by the name of Miles from a choice
seat in the dugout.
Miles' May Start
Miles hasn't been used regularly,
but in three tries as a pinch-hitter,
he has come through once and failed
twice. The first time, he was the
big gun in the rally that won the
first Santa Clara game. The second
time he failed to click with the bases
loaded, and a single needed to win
the game. The other try was in
Monday's game against the All
stars, and although he failed to hit,
he didn't look any worse than the
regulars who were parked around
the diamond for the full nine in
nings.
Last year the Indians almost, lost
the flag by going to sleep and ex
pecting someone else to win the
game, but at least they waited until
the trip South. This season, they
got off on the wrong foot by dozing
off in the second game of the race.
St. Mary's collected just two hits
less than the Indian total last Sat
urday, which shows that they have
the power even though they didn't
score the runs. If the Rcdshirts ex
pect to keep the championship
rvound they will have to show more
than they have so far.
