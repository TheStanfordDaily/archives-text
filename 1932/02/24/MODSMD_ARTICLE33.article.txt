# TOUGH FOR OLD ENGLAND
## 
### 
A good many centuries ago some ambitious Englishmen
made the mistake of conquering the emerald isle of Ire
land, and ever since then the English have been expiating
lliis sin of their ancestors. After no one knows how great
an expenditure of blood, money, and effort in the attempt
to subjugate the temperamental inhabitants of Erin, Britain
is still getting headaches from the irrepressible antics of its
unwilling dependency.
The victory of Eainon de Yalera in the latest Irish presi
dential campaign only means more trouble for the op
pressed English. De Yalera is out hammer and tongs to
abolish the lasl remaining lie which binds bis country to
the unfortunate Britons, the oath of allegiance to the king.
With his Fianna Fail parly holding a majority in the Diet,
De Yalera is in a position to make lots of trouble even if
he doesn't get all that he wants, and it is quite possible that
within a few years England will be willing to give up its
technical hold on Ireland, if only to be rid of the eternal
agitation.
The tough part about it for Great Britain is that no
matter how much independence she gets, Ireland will still
require armed and moral protection by Britain. For her
own vital safety England cannot let a foreign power get
any sort of control over the adjacent island. It would be
more dangerous for her than a European establishment in
Mexico would be for the United States, and it is common
knowledge thai the most innocent moves of other powers
to gain a foothold on tin's continent are sufficient to send
Slate Department officials into spasms.
i herel'ore, an Irish war is of necessity an English war.
Contributing not a shilling to its support, Ireland will, nev
ertheless, be bulwarked by the strong arm of (lie grealest
navy in the world.
II is a bad spot for (.real Britain. She has to do all the
work, take all the hard knocks, while the Irish get all the
gravv and all the sympathy.
