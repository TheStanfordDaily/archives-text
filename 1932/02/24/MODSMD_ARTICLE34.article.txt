# THREE RING CIRCUS
## 
### 
"Lav-decs and gcn-tlc-mcn-n-n, lay your dime on the
line and sec 1 Jo Jo, the dog-faced hoy, before you enter the
big lent for the main-n-n per law— mance!"
I hat sort of ballyhoo is all the Farm needs on a holiday
to be rated as a first-call three ring circus with all of its
sideshows.
On the 1 one hand is the hoi polloi, come from all over
the bay region to get a look at "college life." On the other
are the students. The two lake turns in the three rings;
while one is there llie other looks on in wonder.
Last week-end, for example, with its summer weather,
put the show over in bang-up style, f p and down the row
went streams of cars; here a relic holding man and wife
and seven kids there a chauffeur-piloted super-sixfeen
with a couple of wives in ermine wraps. Butchers, bakers,
mechanics, laborers, lawyers, clerks, doctors and bankers
in everything from I!M7 Fords to I!KW Lincolns.
1 here the students were in the ring, seen as a special
ivpe of persons living a peculiar existence in a world in
cubated and different.
1 hen around the polo field, near the tennis courts, just
off Palm Drive, were city families gathered around lunch
eon spreads under the Kucalyptus trees. Kids playing ball,
anxious mothers screaming at litem, dogs harking to add to
the 1 un and confusion.
I here the "outside world" was on display, and passing
students became the wondering spectators.
It's ;i queer arrangement a wonderful study in human
nature. Some students, couscous that thev are on a stage
every holiday, perform according the role of the col
legian, apparently hoping to arouse awe and envy in the
hearts of those peering in from the "outside."
Others look at Ihe big parade and wonder what can he
the great attraction that brings thousands of curious to the
harm Sunday after Sunday, to ga/e in semi-amazement.
Some wonder too, perhaps, that the visiting hordes
would think il they knew how like their own existence life
here reallv is.

Some wonder too, perhaps, that the visiting hordes

"Lav-decs and gcn-tlc-mcn-n-n, lay your dime on the
line and sec 1 Jo Jo, the dog-faced hoy, before you enter the
big lent for the main-n-n per law— mance!"
I hat sort of ballyhoo is all the Farm needs on a holiday
to be rated as a first-call three ring circus with all of its
sideshows.
On the 1 one hand is the hoi polloi, come from all over
the bay region to get a look at "college life." On the other
are the students. The two lake turns in the three rings;
while one is there llie other looks on in wonder.
Last week-end, for example, with its summer weather,
put the show over in bang-up style, f p and down the row
went streams of cars; here a relic holding man and wife
and seven kids there a chauffeur-piloted super-sixfeen
with a couple of wives in ermine wraps. Butchers, bakers,
mechanics, laborers, lawyers, clerks, doctors and bankers
in everything from I!M7 Fords to I!KW Lincolns.
1 here the students were in the ring, seen as a special
ivpe of persons living a peculiar existence in a world in
cubated and different.
1 hen around the polo field, near the tennis courts, just
off Palm Drive, were city families gathered around lunch
eon spreads under the Kucalyptus trees. Kids playing ball,
anxious mothers screaming at litem, dogs harking to add to
the 1 un and confusion.
I here the "outside world" was on display, and passing
students became the wondering spectators.
It's ;i queer arrangement a wonderful study in human
nature. Some students, couscous that thev are on a stage
every holiday, perform according the role of the col
legian, apparently hoping to arouse awe and envy in the
hearts of those peering in from the "outside."
Others look at Ihe big parade and wonder what can he
the great attraction that brings thousands of curious to the
harm Sunday after Sunday, to ga/e in semi-amazement.
Some wonder too, perhaps, that the visiting hordes
would think il they knew how like their own existence life
here reallv is.
