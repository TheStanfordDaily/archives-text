French debaters on a gesticular spree and as such almost
drew us into argument.

Passed through a town called Klamath Falls which has no
falls. It boasts a ramshackle place called Hoover Hotel built

sleep. We can't decide whether that is a compliment or a
criticism of Stanford's alumnus.
Oregon State College has a students' union that's a cross
between the Frantic and the Federal capitol. Thus far, the
"500" are still best in the West.—Abe Mellinkoff.
Editor's Note. —This is the first of a series of articles to he wired daily
to this paper by the Hull Session editor, Abe Mellinkoff, who is on a northern
debate tour.
