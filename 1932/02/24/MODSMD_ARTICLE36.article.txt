THE WET PARADE—By Upton
Sinclair. Farrar and Rinchart.
New York, 1931. $2.50. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Anti-liquor argument by a prom
inent Socialist is thinly disguised
as a novel, which will interest those
who would like to read the prohibi
tion side of the ever-present de
bate over the Eighteenth Amend
ment, but not those who are seek
ing a work of fiction.
The book is very well done for
the sort of thing it is. Set in
Louisiana, Long Island, and New
York, the story covers both the
pre-war and post-war periods. The
hero and heroine are both children
of Southern gentlemen who have
been degraded and killed by drink
ing, and both are ardent Prohibi
tionists. The hero becomes a federal
agent and is killed in the per
foimance of his duty, while his wife
turns temperance lecturer. By giv
ing both a variegated set of rela
tives, the author manages to bring
in almost all kinds of people, both
wet and dry, who come in contact
with liquor. The characters are
types rather than people, but the
story is the least important thing
about the book.
It ought to be interesting for
those who are a little too much im
bued with opinions of one Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst. —F.J.

—which goes to prove that he
didn't expound all his philosophy in
"Adam and Eve" nor use up all his
bright cracks in "Galahad."
An ordinary, middle-aged man,
driving home from golf, meets with
an accident in which he is appar
ently killed. He finds himself be
fore the Pearly Gates and in the
presence of the Venerable Figure.
Without an invitation the man
commences to explain away to the
Figure his sins on earth.
The Figure, languid and blase,
finds that although the man had
occasionally had evil intentions they
had never materialized, due to the
intervention of chance or his own :
lack of courage. For the same rea- ]

' sons the man had not carried out
his good intentions which, as the
Figure says, is usual in most cases.
As the man is wondering whether
one knocks or rings at the Gates
the Figure tells him he needn't go
in now but may return to earth if
there is something he would like to
finish up. fie also says that what
exists inside the Gates for the man
depends entirely on what he is and
what he has done. The man returns
to his earthly chores.
When at the conclusion the man
, again stands before the Gates, he
! tells the Figure that he has done
| one thing at least.
While we still prefer Erskine,
whom we prefer above most con
temporaries, in such things as "The
Private Life of Helen of Troy" this
somewhat more serious but still
very readable novel is next best.

THE WILD ORCHID—By Sigrid
Undset. Translated from the
Norwegian by Arthur G. Chater.
Alfred A. Knopf. New York, 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
In this first volume of a new
i trilogy, Sigrid Undset leaves the
[ Middle Ages and turns to the Nor
i way in the decade and a half pre
j ceding the war. The struggle of a
young man to solve the problems
lof love and religion is the theme,
; which is treated in a rather discon
| nected fashion, but the book
I breathes an air of such intense
' reality that it is hard to criticize.
It is a great relief to find a book
| such as this whose principal man
| has strength of mind and character,
; as well as human weakness, so that
; he stands out with the many-sided
[ ness of a real person. Of late most
j novels have had heroines of such
j high calibre that the reader cannot
i understand why on earth they ad
j mire, fall in love with, and marry
I the insignificant men.
You ought to read this, if only to
j be able to allude to it in conversa
j tion and show that you are up in
. modern literature and read the
! works of a woman who has won the
1 Nobel Prize. The real reason, how
j ever, ought to be that you can't af-
I ford to miss a book which will
' really teach you a little more about
j men and life. —F.J.

THE WET PARADE—By Upton
Sinclair. Farrar and Rinchart.
New York, 1931. $2.50. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Anti-liquor argument by a prom
inent Socialist is thinly disguised
as a novel, which will interest those
who would like to read the prohibi
tion side of the ever-present de
bate over the Eighteenth Amend
ment, but not those who are seek
ing a work of fiction.
The book is very well done for
the sort of thing it is. Set in
Louisiana, Long Island, and New
York, the story covers both the
pre-war and post-war periods. The
hero and heroine are both children
of Southern gentlemen who have
been degraded and killed by drink
ing, and both are ardent Prohibi
tionists. The hero becomes a federal
agent and is killed in the per
foimance of his duty, while his wife
turns temperance lecturer. By giv
ing both a variegated set of rela
tives, the author manages to bring
in almost all kinds of people, both
wet and dry, who come in contact
with liquor. The characters are
types rather than people, but the
story is the least important thing
about the book.
It ought to be interesting for
those who are a little too much im
bued with opinions of one Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst. —F.J.

An ordinary, middle-aged man,
driving home from golf, meets with
an accident in which he is appar
ently killed. He finds himself be
fore the Pearly Gates and in the
presence of the Venerable Figure.
Without an invitation the man
commences to explain away to the
Figure his sins on earth.
The Figure, languid and blase,
finds that although the man had
occasionally had evil intentions they
had never materialized, due to the
intervention of chance or his own :
lack of courage. For the same rea- ]

' sons the man had not carried out
his good intentions which, as the
Figure says, is usual in most cases.
As the man is wondering whether
one knocks or rings at the Gates
the Figure tells him he needn't go
in now but may return to earth if
there is something he would like to
finish up. fie also says that what
exists inside the Gates for the man
depends entirely on what he is and
what he has done. The man returns
to his earthly chores.
When at the conclusion the man
, again stands before the Gates, he
! tells the Figure that he has done

While we still prefer Erskine,
whom we prefer above most con
temporaries, in such things as "The
Private Life of Helen of Troy" this
somewhat more serious but still
very readable novel is next best.

THE WET PARADE—By Upton
Sinclair. Farrar and Rinchart.
New York, 1931. $2.50. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Anti-liquor argument by a prom
inent Socialist is thinly disguised
as a novel, which will interest those
who would like to read the prohibi
tion side of the ever-present de
bate over the Eighteenth Amend
ment, but not those who are seek
ing a work of fiction.
The book is very well done for
the sort of thing it is. Set in
Louisiana, Long Island, and New
York, the story covers both the
pre-war and post-war periods. The
hero and heroine are both children
of Southern gentlemen who have
been degraded and killed by drink
ing, and both are ardent Prohibi
tionists. The hero becomes a federal
agent and is killed in the per
foimance of his duty, while his wife
turns temperance lecturer. By giv
ing both a variegated set of rela
tives, the author manages to bring
in almost all kinds of people, both
wet and dry, who come in contact
with liquor. The characters are
types rather than people, but the
story is the least important thing
about the book.
It ought to be interesting for
those who are a little too much im
bued with opinions of one Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst. —F.J.

—which goes to prove that he
didn't expound all his philosophy in
"Adam and Eve" nor use up all his
bright cracks in "Galahad."
An ordinary, middle-aged man,
driving home from golf, meets with
an accident in which he is appar
ently killed. He finds himself be
fore the Pearly Gates and in the
presence of the Venerable Figure.
Without an invitation the man
commences to explain away to the
Figure his sins on earth.
The Figure, languid and blase,
finds that although the man had
occasionally had evil intentions they
had never materialized, due to the
intervention of chance or his own :
lack of courage. For the same rea- ]

' sons the man had not carried out
his good intentions which, as the
Figure says, is usual in most cases.
As the man is wondering whether
one knocks or rings at the Gates
the Figure tells him he needn't go
in now but may return to earth if
there is something he would like to
finish up. fie also says that what
exists inside the Gates for the man
depends entirely on what he is and
what he has done. The man returns
to his earthly chores.
When at the conclusion the man
, again stands before the Gates, he
! tells the Figure that he has done
| one thing at least.
While we still prefer Erskine,
whom we prefer above most con
temporaries, in such things as "The
Private Life of Helen of Troy" this
somewhat more serious but still
very readable novel is next best.

Undset. Translated from the
Norwegian by Arthur G. Chater.
Alfred A. Knopf. New York, 1931.
(At the Palo Alto Hook Shop.)
In this first volume of a new
i trilogy, Sigrid Undset leaves the
[ Middle Ages and turns to the Nor
i way in the decade and a half pre
j ceding the war. The struggle of a
young man to solve the problems
lof love and religion is the theme,
; which is treated in a rather discon
| nected fashion, but the book
I breathes an air of such intense
' reality that it is hard to criticize.
It is a great relief to find a book
| such as this whose principal man
| has strength of mind and character,
; as well as human weakness, so that
; he stands out with the many-sided
[ ness of a real person. Of late most
j novels have had heroines of such
j high calibre that the reader cannot
i understand why on earth they ad
j mire, fall in love with, and marry
I the insignificant men.
