Saki's one play at all possible
upon the stage, "The Mistress of
Briony, is quite in the tradition of
his other stories. It concerns a house
party at a country estate, where, in
the absence of a dowager who
wants to run things, the guests turn
routine and convention inside out.
Under the benign influence of
Love Affair
horse-play and intrigue, an unfore
seen love affair develops between
two people who value freedom more
than happiness and their private
lives more than goodwill. Superfi
cially. it may suggest the plays of
Nod Coward and Philip Barry: its
action does unfold in a drawing
room; its people are of the upper,
or near-upper, world; its dialogue
does have its fashionable cliches
and is witty; but there the likeness
ends.
The dialogue may be witty some
times, but it is never "brittle." Its
chief quality is its utmost ease, lu
cidity, "and naturalness. Saki never
indulges in verbal pyrotechnics:
speech gets speech and question
gets answer; any epigram thrown
in is merely good measure, chosen
by the humor of the character or
the demands of the situation.
Stupid People
The characters in this play, like
those in the stories, are stupid, vain,
malicious, idealistic, unmoral, arro
gant, or ridiculous, but they are al
ways impulsive in whatever they
are, and they believe in it intensely.
Moreover, it is only by accident that
they are made to perform in a
drawing-room; a barn or St. Paul's
would do just as well.
Saki knows well what humor is,
and ho is not afraid of it—the great
Hound of the Baskervilles scene in
this play would go in any setting.
