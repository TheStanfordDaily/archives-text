# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## 
### 
Last year, Coach Harry Wolter's !
young hopefuls piled up an enviable
lead in the conference baseball j
standings and then, as Stanlord
tennis are wont to do, attempted to
coast in (in the lead. They first tried
il on Dan Johnson down at U.C.L A.
and Johnson lo;,t the game for them.
Then they fire d up for the Culi- j
fornia series, and, alter v. inning that
for the first time since 1893, they
tried to hand a game to the tail
ending S.F.U. outfit.
This year the Cards nren'l j
waiting for the Southern trip
before making that last-half
coast—they've started in al
ready.
After squeezing out the O.C. in
the opener, the last-year-greats
threw away a came to the All-Stars,
played their only good game to date
against the Kenealy Seals, and then
faced Santa Clara in the conference
curtain-raiser.
The way that the Indians won
that game was a perfect example of
sheer brawn over what's the mat-
It Stanford grabbed off 14 hits and
all but three of the line-up had a
v.hack at Ihe ball with the bases
full and none of 'em connected.
Seventeen died on the bases, and,
if a few of the Redshirts hadn't been
pushed over the plate by errors and
walks from the obliging Broncs, no
doubt the visitors would have won. |
With one victory in the hag, |
the Cards lolled around the field
in the second encounter until
the ninth inning when the
champs went to the plate with ,
the sacks bulging and hit pop-
Hies and double play grounders
to end the miserable exhibition
<m the short end of the score.
Undaunted, the Farm aggregation J
played ball with St. Mary s last I
Saturday until the fifth inning
without a hit or run while the
visitors piled up three. Then by the
grace of God and Noonan's tiring
arm, the big guns battered out
( ii( 11<>h singles to take the contest. I
A couple of days ago a non
confcrence game failed to elicit
any interest from the confer
ence's chosen, and said chosen
had. in their quaint language,
''an off-day."
i
The one big shining point to be j
said in the Cards favor is the way
they do keep on trying to win the
old ball game in the last few cantos, |
even if they have thrown it away
in the first half-dozen innings. But |
that's no way to win and keep on |
winning. And with the all-import- |
ant U.S.C. and California series j
coming up, a wasted game on these i
-o-called "easy" members of the ,
conference can just about ruin |
hopes of another pennant.
Troy tossed away its chance
to heat out Stanford last year |
by just such inadvertent drop
ping of a game apiece to Santa
Clara and St. Mary's. And Stan
lord almost did the same thing
in that U.C.L.A. game last year.
Three more games remain before j
the Moraga-Bronco series are i
washed up. If Stanford collects |
1 hern all to uo South with a won-5 j
lest—l standing, and it Stanford gets |
th" breaks against the Barry-Arbel- j
bide combination at U.S.C., the sea- j
son may turn out all right. But even J
then there st lie California series,
three-game fracas to worry about, j
And rf Stanford gets those three. |
the team has to make certain to t
squeeze tight the six games with ,
U.C.L.A. and S.F.U.
So you see how it is. The
team staggers from one very
likely lo'-s to another very likely
loss?— from one if to another if.
.. ...
Unfortunately baseball isn't quite
a-; sure of it self as are the other |
major sports. No team is beaten un- |
til the last out is away, and a cellar!
outfit is just as likely to take a j
game as are the league leaders.
.
Perhaps the presence of Johnson 1
on the team last year accounts for j
the way the infield tries to let the '
battery and the outfield win the j
games. But there is no Johnson this |
year and last year's pennant is poor |
padding to use in sliding around
the bases. —Howard Moore

lead in the conference baseball j
standings and then, as Stanlord
tennis are wont to do, attempted to
coast in (in the lead. They first tried
il on Dan Johnson down at U.C.L A.
and Johnson lo;,t the game for them.
Then they fire d up for the Culi- j
fornia series, and, alter v. inning that
for the first time since 1893, they
tried to hand a game to the tail
ending S.F.U. outfit.
This year the Cards nren'l j
waiting for the Southern trip
before making that last-half
coast—they've started in al
ready.
After squeezing out the O.C. in
the opener, the last-year-greats
threw away a came to the All-Stars,
played their only good game to date
against the Kenealy Seals, and then
faced Santa Clara in the conference
curtain-raiser.
The way that the Indians won
that game was a perfect example of
sheer brawn over what's the mat-
It Stanford grabbed off 14 hits and
all but three of the line-up had a
v.hack at Ihe ball with the bases
full and none of 'em connected.
Seventeen died on the bases, and,
if a few of the Redshirts hadn't been
pushed over the plate by errors and
walks from the obliging Broncs, no
doubt the visitors would have won. |
With one victory in the hag, |
the Cards lolled around the field
in the second encounter until
the ninth inning when the
champs went to the plate with ,
the sacks bulging and hit pop-
Hies and double play grounders
to end the miserable exhibition
<m the short end of the score.
Undaunted, the Farm aggregation J
played ball with St. Mary s last I
Saturday until the fifth inning
without a hit or run while the
visitors piled up three. Then by the
grace of God and Noonan's tiring
arm, the big guns battered out
( ii( 11<>h singles to take the contest. I
A couple of days ago a non
confcrence game failed to elicit
any interest from the confer
ence's chosen, and said chosen
had. in their quaint language,
''an off-day."
i
The one big shining point to be j
said in the Cards favor is the way
they do keep on trying to win the
old ball game in the last few cantos, |
even if they have thrown it away
in the first half-dozen innings. But |
that's no way to win and keep on |
winning. And with the all-import- |
ant U.S.C. and California series j
coming up, a wasted game on these i
-o-called "easy" members of the ,
conference can just about ruin |
hopes of another pennant.
Troy tossed away its chance
to heat out Stanford last year |
by just such inadvertent drop
ping of a game apiece to Santa
Clara and St. Mary's. And Stan
lord almost did the same thing
in that U.C.L.A. game last year.
Three more games remain before j
the Moraga-Bronco series are i
washed up. If Stanford collects |
1 hern all to uo South with a won-5 j
lest—l standing, and it Stanford gets |
th" breaks against the Barry-Arbel- j
bide combination at U.S.C., the sea- j
son may turn out all right. But even J
then there st lie California series,
three-game fracas to worry about, j
And rf Stanford gets those three. |
the team has to make certain to t
squeeze tight the six games with ,
U.C.L.A. and S.F.U.
So you see how it is. The
team staggers from one very
likely lo'-s to another very likely
loss?— from one if to another if.
.. ...
Unfortunately baseball isn't quite
a-; sure of it self as are the other |
major sports. No team is beaten un- |
til the last out is away, and a cellar!
outfit is just as likely to take a j
game as are the league leaders.
.
Perhaps the presence of Johnson 1
on the team last year accounts for j
the way the infield tries to let the '
battery and the outfield win the j
games. But there is no Johnson this |
year and last year's pennant is poor |
padding to use in sliding around
the bases. —Howard Moore

tennis are wont to do, attempted to
coast in (in the lead. They first tried
il on Dan Johnson down at U.C.L A.
and Johnson lo;,t the game for them.
Then they fire d up for the Culi- j
fornia series, and, alter v. inning that
for the first time since 1893, they
tried to hand a game to the tail
ending S.F.U. outfit.
This year the Cards nren'l j
waiting for the Southern trip
before making that last-half
coast—they've started in al
ready.
After squeezing out the O.C. in
the opener, the last-year-greats
threw away a came to the All-Stars,
played their only good game to date
against the Kenealy Seals, and then
faced Santa Clara in the conference
curtain-raiser.
The way that the Indians won
that game was a perfect example of
sheer brawn over what's the mat-
It Stanford grabbed off 14 hits and
all but three of the line-up had a
v.hack at Ihe ball with the bases
full and none of 'em connected.
Seventeen died on the bases, and,
if a few of the Redshirts hadn't been
pushed over the plate by errors and
walks from the obliging Broncs, no
doubt the visitors would have won. |
With one victory in the hag, |
the Cards lolled around the field
in the second encounter until
the ninth inning when the
champs went to the plate with ,
the sacks bulging and hit pop-
Hies and double play grounders
to end the miserable exhibition
<m the short end of the score.
Undaunted, the Farm aggregation J
played ball with St. Mary s last I
Saturday until the fifth inning
without a hit or run while the
visitors piled up three. Then by the
grace of God and Noonan's tiring
arm, the big guns battered out
( ii( 11<>h singles to take the contest. I
A couple of days ago a non
confcrence game failed to elicit
any interest from the confer
ence's chosen, and said chosen
had. in their quaint language,
''an off-day."
i
The one big shining point to be j
said in the Cards favor is the way
they do keep on trying to win the
old ball game in the last few cantos, |
even if they have thrown it away
in the first half-dozen innings. But |
that's no way to win and keep on |
winning. And with the all-import- |
ant U.S.C. and California series j
coming up, a wasted game on these i
-o-called "easy" members of the ,
conference can just about ruin |
hopes of another pennant.
Troy tossed away its chance
to heat out Stanford last year |
by just such inadvertent drop
ping of a game apiece to Santa
Clara and St. Mary's. And Stan
lord almost did the same thing
in that U.C.L.A. game last year.
Three more games remain before j
the Moraga-Bronco series are i
washed up. If Stanford collects |
1 hern all to uo South with a won-5 j
lest—l standing, and it Stanford gets |
th" breaks against the Barry-Arbel- j
bide combination at U.S.C., the sea- j
son may turn out all right. But even J
then there st lie California series,
three-game fracas to worry about, j
And rf Stanford gets those three. |
the team has to make certain to t
squeeze tight the six games with ,
U.C.L.A. and S.F.U.
So you see how it is. The
team staggers from one very
likely lo'-s to another very likely
loss?— from one if to another if.
.. ...
Unfortunately baseball isn't quite
a-; sure of it self as are the other |
major sports. No team is beaten un- |
til the last out is away, and a cellar!
outfit is just as likely to take a j
game as are the league leaders.
.
Perhaps the presence of Johnson 1
on the team last year accounts for j
the way the infield tries to let the '
battery and the outfield win the j
games. But there is no Johnson this |
year and last year's pennant is poor |
padding to use in sliding around
the bases. —Howard Moore
