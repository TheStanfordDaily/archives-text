DUBLIN, Irish Free State, Feb.
I 23. (/P) â€”Supporters of Eamon de
i Valera, once in danger of his life
for his struggle against British
power, today rejoiced as his Fianna
I Fail party scored a slim victory
over the conservative parly of Pres
ident William T. Cosgrave. Cos
i grave and his cabinct have con-
J ceded defeat.
With the returns from the elec
tion completed except for seven
j districts in which the voting was
j postponed, Eamon de Valera's Fian
na Fail and and its Labor allies had
won seventy-seven seats in the new
Dail Eirann, as compared with
| sixty-eight for the government party
; and its independent supporters.
President Cosgrave said he and
! his Cabinet had definitely deter
! mined to go into the opposition. He
j said reports he was seeking alliance
! with any group to keep de Valera's
I Fianna Fail out of power were to
' tally unfounded.
"In the past decade the Labor
! party and the Fianna Fail have been
attacking and blaming us for many
things," he said. "They blamed us
for financial depression and low
j prices. I propose now to let them
I work out a plan of prosperity, and
| I will assist them in every way I
j can in that direction. If they suc
-1 ceed, I will take off my hat to them."
