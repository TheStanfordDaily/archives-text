## DIVISIONAL TITLES WILL BE SETTLED TOMORROW NIGHT Unlimited Semi-Final Bouts Supply Many Thrills For Spectators 
### Maurice Rapf 
With the finals of the all-Uni
versity wrestling tournament sched
uled for the Pavilion tomorrow
night, there remained but 18 eon
tenders for the seven divisional
weight titles, following yesterday
afternoon's preliminaries in the
gymnasium.
Matches were held in all except
the 115- and 125- pound weight
groups, but it was the big boys of
the unlimited division who fur
nished the majority of thrills, al-
I though some of the lighter men dis
played fast and clever attacks.
Taylor Wins
IL was a case of brawn against
brawn when Bob Taylor and Don
Tafum rolled about the mat, but
Taylor evidently had a little too
! much brawn and just a little too
j many headlocks for his opponent,
I with the result that he pinned
j Tatum to the mat after three min
j utes and 20 seconds of grappling.
Dick Gould will meet Taylor in
the semi-finals tomorrow night. His
victory over Frank Smith with a
half-Nelson after a short minute's
battle showed that he will hold his
own against the brutish Taylor, and
j with ability to slip the deadly head
| locks, he may surprise with a win.
White To He Finalist
Jack White became the finalist in
the unlimited division after he had
won a decision over Hans Lund in
I an uninteresting no-fall bout. Both
men were on the defensive and re
fused to mix grips, but White had
over a minute to his credit in time
advantage. By virtue of drawing a
bye in semi-final competition, White
will meet the winner of the Gould-
Taylor match.
Louis Janin won his way into the
; 175-pound finals with a time ad
j vantage victory over Will Woods. I
I Janin and Woods fought on practi- j
J cidly even terms throughout the i
• regular six-minute period, with
j both men striving frantically for a
fall. Janin had the best of the going
| in the extra period, and won by a
I two-minute advantage.
Perelli-Minctli Loses
Probably the most exciting match
I of the afternoon was that in which
I Herb Holm won a one-fall decision
I ever Bill Perelli-Minetti. The tvvo
men grappled without touching the |
| mat for the first two minutes, a rest
! period was called, and Holm went j
down in the middle of the ring to 1
1 re-open the battle. For two minutes
and 55 seconds the struggle went
I on, but Holm finally brought Mi
j netti's shoulders to the mat with a j
well-executed half-Nelson.
The biggest surprise of the day j
j was George Leavens in the 145- '
pound division. Hardly conceded a |
| chance for any honors at all, Leav- |
| ens turned in two impressive wins I
over Max Valonte and Ben Cave as
1 a result of half-Nelsons which net
| ted falls.
Winston Phillips and Leonard |
! Yr udalls won their way into the \
finals of the 155-pound group.

j utes and 20 seconds of grappling.
Dick Gould will meet Taylor in
the semi-finals tomorrow night. His
victory over Frank Smith with a
half-Nelson after a short minute's
battle showed that he will hold his
own against the brutish Taylor, and
j with ability to slip the deadly head
| locks, he may surprise with a win.
White To He Finalist
Jack White became the finalist in
the unlimited division after he had
won a decision over Hans Lund in
I an uninteresting no-fall bout. Both
men were on the defensive and re
fused to mix grips, but White had
over a minute to his credit in time
advantage. By virtue of drawing a
bye in semi-final competition, White
will meet the winner of the Gould-
Taylor match.
Louis Janin won his way into the
; 175-pound finals with a time ad
j vantage victory over Will Woods. I
I Janin and Woods fought on practi- j
J cidly even terms throughout the i
• regular six-minute period, with
j both men striving frantically for a
fall. Janin had the best of the going
| in the extra period, and won by a
I two-minute advantage.
Perelli-Minctli Loses
Probably the most exciting match
I of the afternoon was that in which
I Herb Holm won a one-fall decision
I ever Bill Perelli-Minetti. The tvvo
men grappled without touching the |
| mat for the first two minutes, a rest
! period was called, and Holm went j
down in the middle of the ring to 1
1 re-open the battle. For two minutes
and 55 seconds the struggle went
I on, but Holm finally brought Mi
j netti's shoulders to the mat with a j
well-executed half-Nelson.
The biggest surprise of the day j
j was George Leavens in the 145- '
pound division. Hardly conceded a |
| chance for any honors at all, Leav- |
| ens turned in two impressive wins I
over Max Valonte and Ben Cave as
1 a result of half-Nelsons which net
| ted falls.
Winston Phillips and Leonard |
! Yr udalls won their way into the \
finals of the 155-pound group.
With the finals of the all-Uni
versity wrestling tournament sched
uled for the Pavilion tomorrow
night, there remained but 18 eon
tenders for the seven divisional
weight titles, following yesterday
afternoon's preliminaries in the
gymnasium.
Matches were held in all except
the 115- and 125- pound weight
groups, but it was the big boys of
the unlimited division who fur
nished the majority of thrills, al-
I though some of the lighter men dis
played fast and clever attacks.
Taylor Wins
IL was a case of brawn against
brawn when Bob Taylor and Don
Tafum rolled about the mat, but
Taylor evidently had a little too
! much brawn and just a little too
j many headlocks for his opponent,
I with the result that he pinned
j Tatum to the mat after three min
j utes and 20 seconds of grappling.
