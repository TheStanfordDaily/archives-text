schedule issued over the week-end,
Stanford's knights of the cinder
path, Ihe dirt circle, and the sand
pit, will take part in four dual
meets and an equal number of open
team affairs this year. The season
will open with a contest of speed
and brawn with the Olympic Club
on March 5. Both this meet and the
one with the L.A.A.C., which are
the only dual meets to be held at 1
Stanford, will lake place on the old
oval and not in the Stadium.
The Big Meet will be held at
Eerkeley on April 16, and the i
much-awaited conflict with Dean!
Cromwell's Trojans comes off in
Lor, Angeles on April 30. Rumors of
I a meet with S.F.U. for April 9 have
not been officially confirmed.
The track team received consider
able good news when its captain,

; Aivin Hables, announced that he
would be out again about March 20.
H-ibles has had a leave of absence
due to an attack of pneumonia and
it was feared that he would not be
in shape at all this year.
A) Ray showed that he had an
off day last Friday when he threw
the javelin 203 feet by actual meas
urement yesterday afternoon. Ray's
efforts in the interclars meet were
1 considerably hampered by an attack
of nervousness that prevented him
from getting his steps correctly.
Les Hables, who has also been ill,
1 lias lost his avaricious appetite but
1 has regained his track form. Hables
has suffered from so many diseases
during the past two seasons that it
is almost certain that he will be in
good condition for the rest of the
year: there is nothing else for him
1 to contract.
