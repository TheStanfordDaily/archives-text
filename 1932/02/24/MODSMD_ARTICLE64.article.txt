There was an uproar when Germans discovered that the beauty
selected to bear the title "Miss Germany 1932" wasn't a "fraulein" at
all, but a "frau." It's against the rules for a married woman to be
"Miss Germany." So the honor was transferred to pretty Fraulein
Liselotte de Booy (above), who had been second in the judging.
