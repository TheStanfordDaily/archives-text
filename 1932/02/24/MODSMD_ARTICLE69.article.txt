# WOMEN DEBATERS FLAY DIVORCE LAW
## 
### 
Contending that Nevada's divorce
laws will lead to a breakdown of
our social standards, Stanford's
women debaters will engage in a
forensic contest with a women's
team from Oregon State College to
morrow evening at 8 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
Stanford will uphold the affirma
tive side of the question, "Resolved,
That the divorce laws of the State
of Nevada should be condemned."
Marion Harper will be first speaker
and Mary Rechif will talk second.
Both women arc experienced de
baters.
