## Naval Ratios Dependent On Recognized Open-Door Policy In Orient JOHNSON LAUDS MOVE Treaty Observance Would Avert Japan War 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24
retary Stimson today issued a force
ful reminder that world naval ratios
are dependent upon treaties affect
ing the Orient and asserted these
pacts are threatened by the Sino-
Japanese conflict.
In a vigorous reaffirmation of
American policy op the Far East
ern crisis, contained in a letter to
Chairman Borah of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee, he said
the United States stands firmly by
these treaties and that the present
troubles could have been avoided
by their strict observance.
Johnson Backs Move
Borah declined to comment on the
Stimson pronouncement. Senator
Johnson of California, ranking Re
publican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, indorsed the Secretary's
statement and said "the implication
that we are free now to pursue our
own course is fully justified and 1
trust will become a reality."
Mr. Stimson's reference to naval
treaties drew immediate attention
in view of the arms reduction con
ference now on in Geneva and ef
forts in Congi'ess to build the navy
up to maximum treaty limits. The
Senate Naval Committee today ap
proved a measure to bring this
about.
Arms Conference
Stimson pointed out that the
Washington confei'ence of 1922
which signed the Nine-Power treaty
guaranteeing the territorial integ
rity of China was in fact an arms
reduction conference.
He also held that the United
States agreed to give up some of its
battleships and abandon fortifications
at Guam and in the Philippines be
cause it believed the international
understanding reached about China
would lessen danger of conflict in
the Far East.
