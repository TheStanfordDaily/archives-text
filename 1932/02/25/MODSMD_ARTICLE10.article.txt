# BEEMER WILL SHOW INVENTION TO STOP AUTO BODY SQUEAKS
## 
### 
A device which he invented for
(liminating body squeaks and rat
tles in a closed car will be demon
strated by Paul Beemer, a student
in the engineering school, before
the San Francisco section of the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers tonight.
Beemer's invention is a triangular
biace forming part of the frame and
fitting inside the hood. By increas
ing the rigidity of the frame it pre
vents torsional twist, which causes
body squeaks.
In competition with entries from
the unversities of California and
Santa Clara, Beemer will try for
the San Francisco section's annual
award of junior membership and a
pin. His paper is entitled "Tortional
Twist in Automobile Frames."
