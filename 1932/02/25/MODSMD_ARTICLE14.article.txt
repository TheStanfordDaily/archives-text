## "Mistress Of Briony" Has Talented Actors And Clever Dialogue 
### 
By Harrison Foss
Parting of the curtain tomorrow
; night on Saki's "Mistress of Briony"
at 8:30 o'clock will mark a major
event in dramatic history here.
A masterly chosen cast under the
direction of Harold Helvenston will
proceed to wring dry the cleverest
show that has been presented on the
Stanford stage for years.
A large proportion of the "Mis-
I tress of Briony" cast acted in
j "Berkeley Square," the successful
j play presented here last quarter.
: Those who acted in it and who are
; taking roles in the present produc
tion are: Barbara Collins, who will
i play Hortensia, Edward Gerzi as
j blubbering Rene St. Gall, and Kath
j leen Hatfield as Syble Homont.
Characters Ridiculous
Characters in Saki's "Mistress of
Briony" are such a ridiculous outfit
j that it is surprising that this merry
i hodgepodge hasn't been acted
I oftener.
Frederick Stover as Ludovic Bav
i vel promises to be one of the most
| interesting of the entire cast. Stover
j has been connected with the tech
j nical side of the campus stage for
! sc.me time and has appeared in two
j Big Game Gaieties. Ludovic's po
! litical aspirations are always com
! ing into conflict with Hortensia's
I ideas. As Hortensia's power comes
| directly from her being the rujing
i mistress of Briony it is to Ludovic's
j best interests that she be dethroned.
Slayton New
The role of Agatha Clifford will
1 be played by Martha Slayton, who
j is new to Stanford audiences. Miss
I Slayton in Saki's play is described
as being delightfully awkward. Two
j actresses who are well known on
I the campus and who will be seen
! t-gain are Dorothy Tully and Cath
! erine Musante. They will play Clare
; Hennessey and Mrs. Vulpy, respec
! tively.
Stephen Sparrow will be in
j terpreted by Joseph Laury, Hugo
| Druel will play the page boy at
i Briony, while William Reppy has
I been cast as John the under-butler.
j The Youngest Drummond Boy
! (Saki gives him no other name),
; who poses at parties as the hound I
of the Baskervilles, will be humor- 1
Gusly done by Louis Moore.
A few good seats for the '"Mistress
I of Briony" are still obtainable at (
I the dramatic manager's office.

Characters in Saki's "Mistress of
Briony" are such a ridiculous outfit
j that it is surprising that this merry
i hodgepodge hasn't been acted
I oftener.
Frederick Stover as Ludovic Bav
i vel promises to be one of the most
| interesting of the entire cast. Stover
j has been connected with the tech
j nical side of the campus stage for
! sc.me time and has appeared in two
j Big Game Gaieties. Ludovic's po
! litical aspirations are always com
! ing into conflict with Hortensia's
I ideas. As Hortensia's power comes
| directly from her being the rujing
i mistress of Briony it is to Ludovic's
j best interests that she be dethroned.
Slayton New
The role of Agatha Clifford will
1 be played by Martha Slayton, who
j is new to Stanford audiences. Miss
I Slayton in Saki's play is described
as being delightfully awkward. Two
j actresses who are well known on
I the campus and who will be seen
! t-gain are Dorothy Tully and Cath
! erine Musante. They will play Clare
; Hennessey and Mrs. Vulpy, respec
! tively.
Stephen Sparrow will be in
j terpreted by Joseph Laury, Hugo
| Druel will play the page boy at
i Briony, while William Reppy has
I been cast as John the under-butler.
j The Youngest Drummond Boy
! (Saki gives him no other name),
; who poses at parties as the hound I
of the Baskervilles, will be humor- 1
Gusly done by Louis Moore.
A few good seats for the '"Mistress
I of Briony" are still obtainable at (
I the dramatic manager's office.

Parting of the curtain tomorrow
; night on Saki's "Mistress of Briony"
at 8:30 o'clock will mark a major
event in dramatic history here.
A masterly chosen cast under the
direction of Harold Helvenston will
proceed to wring dry the cleverest
show that has been presented on the
Stanford stage for years.
A large proportion of the "Mis-
I tress of Briony" cast acted in
j "Berkeley Square," the successful
j play presented here last quarter.
: Those who acted in it and who are
; taking roles in the present produc
tion are: Barbara Collins, who will
i play Hortensia, Edward Gerzi as
j blubbering Rene St. Gall, and Kath
j leen Hatfield as Syble Homont.
