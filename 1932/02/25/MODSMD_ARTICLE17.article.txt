# Ogg Proves Theory Wtih Violet Ray, High Voltage

Working with a high voltage elcc- |
trie spark rich in ultra-violet light j
waves—a spark which crackled back j
and forth and turned his small lab- ;
f ratory into a veritable din of deaf- |
jening thunder—Richard A. Jr.,
! Stanford graduate chemistry stu
| dent, recently proved a hypothesis i
j which he formulated over a year and |
a half ago.
Ogg conceived the idea that a [
j metal with an extremely positive re- j
|action, such as sodium, would break]
| down and combine with a solution
I of ammonia under the influence of
ultra-violet light.
Ultra-violet light had never be- J
.fore been used to effect the decom- |
position of sodium. Now, a year and
| a half after the idea first occurred j
to him, he has succeeded in com
jplcting the reaction and definitely
establishing its occurrence.
The reaction is entirely new in

the field of inorganic chemistry, yet
strangely enough, is of no practical I
value, being of scientific interest
only. Ogg's study has been con- 1
cerned essentially with the influence
of extreme ultra-violet light upon I
sodium.
Since this element reacts with ex- j
plosive violence when placed in wa- j
ter. a solution of liquid ammonia had \
to be used. Professor Francis Berg- J
strom of the Chemistry Department J
has worked in collaboration with
Ogg in setting up the complicated j
apparatus necessary for the experi- ;
merit.
Professor Bergstrom pointed out '
that the idea was originally Ogg's,
and that to him should go the credit j
for the discovery. Ogg is working !
for his Ph.D. degree in Chemistry '
at the present time. He is also presi
dent ol Phi Lambda Upsilon, chem
istry honor society.
