# DARROW PLANS TO AID MASSIE DEFENSE FIGHT
## Honolulu Lynch Defendants Engage Criminal Law Dean For Trial 
### 
HONOLULU, Feb. 24 (A*)â€” Neg
otiations have been entei'ed into with
Clarence Darrow, noted criminal
lawyer, to defend Mrs. Granville
Fortescue and three others against
second degree murder charges
March 10, the Associated Press
learned today.
The defendants are accused of
shooting to death Joseph Kahaha
wai, one of five men who had been
charged with assaulting Mrs. For
tescue's daughter, the wife of Lieu
tenant Thomas H Massie of the
United States Navy. Massie and
two enlisted men of the navy, E. J.
Lord and Albert O. Jones, are the
others charged with Mrs. Fortescue.
Confers With Malone
Darrow was in conference with
Dudley Field Malone in New York
yesterday, it was learned, and was
reported favorable to coming to Ho
nolulu to take charge of the defense.
Further information was unob
tainable here, but it was almost cer
tain Darrow's coming to Honolulu
would mean postponement of the
trial set for March 10.
See Trial Delay
So far the prosecution has not
been acquainted with the possibility
of Darrow's connection, but it is be
lieved certain the defense will ask
for a delay in order to permit Dar
row to familiarize himself with the
case.
Another reaction to the appoint
ment of a new counsel for the de
fense probably would be a retrial of
the asserted assailants of Mrs.
Massie in advance of the murder
trial.
Persons favorable to Mrs. For
tescue and her codefendants be
lieve the conviction of the four men
accused with Kahahawai of assault
ing Mrs. Massie would mean a strong
point toward acquittal of those
charged with killing Kahahawai.
