# OFF-CAMPUS GROUP MAY LUNCH IN OLD UNION CLUB ROOM
## 
### 
Filling a definite need for organ- i
ization of off-campus lunchers, the !
club room of the old Union Build- ;
ing has been set aside for the use |
of these students between 12 and
12:30 o'clock every day of the ,
school week.
The organization is under the
auspices of the Mothers' Club, and 1
has succeeded largely through the ;
efforts of Mrs. Roth and Mrs. Spen- i
ner. Over seventy-five meals have j
thus far been consumed in the club
room, and if sufficient interest is
taken by the students concerned an
effort for permanent organization ,
will be made.
Coffee for five cents and milk for |
seven cents is available at the lunch j
hour.
