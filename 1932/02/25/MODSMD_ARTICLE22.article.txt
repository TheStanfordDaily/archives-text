# Alpha Delt In 25-23 Victory Over Zeta Psi
## Los Arcos Trims A.K.L.'s 22-9; Fijis Defeated 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Score at the end of two hectic I
regular periods of the Alpha Delt- |
Zeta Psi intramural clash last night !
was 21-21, after one extra period I
23-23, and when it was beginning i
to look as if a second extra period j
would be of no avail, an Alpha Delt j
forward named Parmer Fuller eased
a beautiful shot through the hoop to j
defeat an aggressive Zeta Psi quin- !
tet 25-23.
Such is the briefest possible sum- j
mary of the closest mural cage con- j
test witnessed to date. Charlie j
White on the Zete's side of the ar
gument contributed five baskets and !
one free shot to the cause which I
almost triumphed. Jack Hillman, j
with three baskets, and Wheeler |
Coberly, with two, helped form an j
excellent offensive combination. j

Score at the end of two hectic I
regular periods of the Alpha Delt- |
Zeta Psi intramural clash last night !
was 21-21, after one extra period I
23-23, and when it was beginning i
to look as if a second extra period j
would be of no avail, an Alpha Delt j
forward named Parmer Fuller eased
a beautiful shot through the hoop to j
defeat an aggressive Zeta Psi quin- !
tet 25-23.
Such is the briefest possible sum- j
mary of the closest mural cage con- j
test witnessed to date. Charlie j
White on the Zete's side of the ar
gument contributed five baskets and !
one free shot to the cause which I
almost triumphed. Jack Hillman, j
with three baskets, and Wheeler |
Coberly, with two, helped form an j
excellent offensive combination. j
