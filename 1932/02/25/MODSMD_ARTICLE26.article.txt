NEW YORK, Feb. 24. (/Piâ€”Al
though Governor Franklin D.
Po I 'evelt struck a heavy blow to
ny at Tammany Hall when he
ousted Sheriff Thomas M. Farley
of New York on serious graft
charges, the Tiger will not strike
back for fear of losing prestige at
the Democratic national convention.
The silence of Tammany is not
matched by Roosevelt, who made a
broad pronouncement against the
ex-sheriff on the basis of charges
brought by Samuel Seabury, head
ol an investigating committee.

and last week presented evidence
a' a hearing before Governor Roose
