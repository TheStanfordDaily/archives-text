# GAELS TROUNCE INDIAN NINE IN EXTRA INNINGS
## Texas Leaguer Lost In Dark Nets Saint Eleventh Frame Victory SERIES BATTLE EVEN Campbell And Rintala Swat Two Bingles Each 
### Bob Wade 
A pop fly that Jones, St. Mary's
right fielder, sent into the gathering
gloom with the bases loaded and
one down in the eleventh inning,
gave the Saints an 8-7 victory over
(he Stanford varsity in the second
contest of their annual three-game
series, on the Moraga field yester
day afternoon.
The blow was a weak bingle that
would have been a cinch out in the
daylight, but in the near-darkness
Goldmann was unable to see the
ball until too late to gather it in.
Cards Lead
The Cards led five to two, after a
three-run splurge in their half of
the seventh, but the Moragans came
back to take a 6 to 5 lead in the
other half when they drove Caddel
to the showers.
The Indians tied it up again in
the eighth, but were unable to put
the winning run across in the ninth.
Goodell drew a walk in the tenth,
Trautman singled, and Noonan
walked Livermore and Campbell to
force Goodell across the plate. But
the Saints evened the count when
Estes hit McDermott and Wilson and
Kane singled to bring McDermott
across. Delmas saved the game Ihen
when he took Beasley's grounder
and threw Wilson out at the plate,
b: The Cards filled the bases in
the eleventh, but couldn't push a
marker over. The Saints put two
men on base, and Jadrich sacrificed
them along. Philippi took McDer
mott's slow grounder and threw the
first one, Nconan, out at the plate.
Wilson was purposely walked, and
then Jones slapped out his lucky
single. The box score:
