# THE SAMURAI CARRY ON
## 
### 
II may he, us many people believe, that Hie militaristic;
spirit of the old samurai tradition is pushing Japan along |
the path of agression in China, hut at least that spirit has j
added one glorious deed to history. Nothing could show;
more plainly the inlluencc of the samurai code than the
heroic act of the three Japanese privates who broke ('.hi-;
nese wire entanglements at Miaocluingchcn by strapping
explosives about their bodies and allowing Chinese bullets
to explode the dynamite.
Calm judgment may deplore the necessity for such a
sacrifice, may feel that the lives were wasted in an un
worthy cause, but it is impossible not to accord to those I
men the highest admiration which the world gives its
heroes.
The supreme spirit of self-sacrifice for the fatherland,
exemplified by their deed and inculcated in the Japanese!
ethical nature by the principles of the medieval military j
clans, recalls to western minds the classical Roman ideal.;
The three privates in General I yeda's army iind their j
counterpart in Hegulus, advising his country to make war
though he knew that his advice meant death to him when {
he returned to the Carthaginian prison.
Rut even more similar is the act of the Swiss patriot, j
Arnold von Winkelried, who, at the battle of Sempach, i
gathered the spears of the Austrian phalanx fo his breast
and so broke a gap for the Swiss swordsmen.
Right or wrong, sublime patriots or blind fanatics, the
human mines of Miaochungchcn reached the ultimate peak
of courage. The names of kitagawa, Kgami, and Sakuyi
are enrolled beside those of Regulus, von Winkelried, and |
the others on the list of history's greatest heroes.
