						ALL-AMERICAN

### 
Alfred K. Smilli, four limes governor of New York,
Tammany sachem, one-lime presidential candidate, and
builder of (all buildings, was chosen ns the "greatest living
American" bv the senior class of Manhattan College, New
York City, in a recent contest. %
Now, the point of this editorial is not to comment upon
whether the selection of "Newsboy Al" was good or not.
However, it is questionable whether Mr. Smith would con
sider his being chosen the IIKJ2 all-American such a great
honor it he knew that the same group picked (ircta (iarbo
and .Jackie Cooper us its favorite actress and actor.
