Editor, Stanford Daily:
EUGENE, Ore., Feb. 24.—With "Come Join the Band" on
one lip and "Mail, Stanford, Hail" on the other, a fighting !
Stanford debate team was defeated by Willamette last night.
Both members of the audience, lulled to sleep by the opposi- !
tion, could not be awakened by the boys from Palo Alto.
.
Willamette is a unique place, and the ugly head of riotous I
college living never shows its head here. Cigarettes are
banned. Student dances are prohibited. And co-eds are safe
in bed by eleven on week-ends except for special occasions, j
when they are allowed to stay out till twelve. That should j
make the "500" feel like big-time, high-stepping cosmopoli
tans, all right.

My modest estimation of Stanford pulchritude is changing
to thankful appreciation and deep reverence as we push!
farther into these Northern woods.—Abe Mellinkoff.
