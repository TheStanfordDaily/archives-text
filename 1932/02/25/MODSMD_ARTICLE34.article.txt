THREE WISE GIRLS—At Hie New
Mcnlo Theatre.
The story starts out with virtue
in the person of Jean Harlow walk
ing home from an auto ride. It soon
resolves itself into the old haggled
theme of the country-girl-in-the
big-city-of-New York.
But after she gets there, the hag
gling stops abruptly. The country
girl becomes a model through a girl
friend of hers who has been un
lucky enough to fall in love with a
married man.
Then ensues a more or less in
triguing plot with the old shall-I
or-shall-I-not question put to the
country lass when she also has
fallen for a married man. Marie
Prevost introduces a bit of comedy
now and then over envelope ad
dresses and Irish chauffeurs.
The plot moves along rapidly to
an agreeable and rational climax and
the usual dull moments in a pic
ture of this type seem to have been
cut to a minimum. There is com
edy which provides an occasional
laugh and a plot which hold interest
with its uniqueness and intrigue
and on the whole it's a show worth
spending a couple of hours seeing.
And while on the subject of good
shows, "File No. 113," recently at
the Menlo, was a fairly good pre
sentation of French detective fiction.

ANOTHER BILL OF ONE-ACT
PLAYS—At the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre.
Child players using very pun
gently mature statements always
have a depressing effect upon an
audience. After Joseph MacTen
wink, Jr., has made a ridiculously
typical statement concerning Life,
Love, or the High Cost of Living,
all the elders in the audience inevi
tably grin whimsically and cluck
their tongues parentally.
A band of irresponsible infants
received the approval of all mam
mas and papas in the Community
Theatre audience last Monday eve
ning. Their play was "All About
Washington" and, were it not for

I
. (he sworn statement of M. Rei
j dar Torjussen that the whole thing
i was the idea of the junior players
i themselves, I should have thought
jit just some more surreptitious
j school-teaching.
The other plays, somewhat less
; mature than this, were acted by the
j older group. Two quotations may
I give the tone of each. "The Choice's"
I line was "George, George"—this
! sniveled—"you are only a lad, stay
j here in the plantation; it needs
! you."
"The Wedding Dress," Phoebe
Hoffman's contribution to the mass
\ of proof that stupidity among man
j kind may chiefly be traced to play
: wrights, consisted chiefly of further
I sobs, an oft-repeated gag-line, and
| "I must see Nancy .... Damn Far
ragut .... Oh. hello Farragut."
I The entire affair—despite the in
; timations circulated concerning my
| critical faculty, moral decadence,
I and physical impotence since my
1 comments of a week ago—was very
bad indeed. —J.S.S.
HELL DIVERS—At the Stanford
Theatre.
t If you like to have your ears hum
| for an hour after leaving the thea
. tre, you will like "Hell Divers."
1 Even if you don't like to have your
ears hum, you may like "Hell
j Divers." Seriously, the current pic
! ture at the Stanford has its mo
' ments.
Gable is in the show, a fact which
, constitutes an attraction in itself,
but he is not the dominant Clark
Gable you know from his sparring
j experiences with Norma Shearer
i and Joan Crawford. In "Hell Divers"
he waives premier honors to Wal
; lace Beery, who plays his usual
1 shuffling, blustering role a little
I better than ever.
i Cliff Edwards is shoved into the
' background, getting only two or
j three wise-cracking opportunities,
while Dorothy Jordan is a very
| damp cloth as heroine.
Not "the sensation of 1932," as
I billed, but a fair show. If you
i haven't anything better to do—
I —J.H.C.
