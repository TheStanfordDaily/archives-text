# CANINE DEFEATS CLASS Threatened With Studying DOG LEAVES IN FRIGHT
## 
### 
A dog which showed more than
I'.uman intelligence was the cause of
u major outbreak of laughter in a
sophomore German class recently.
The hound, which was of the
breed that can be referred to in no
other way than as the "mutt" type,
wandered uninvited into the 9
o'clock class and proceeded to
t'azedly sniffle at the more delecta
ble feel which sprawled on the floor
amid the confusion of books, bind
ers, and discarded Dailies.
Confused by unexpected petting
and a chorus of whistles, the dog
performed gyrations which ruined
any possibility that someone in the
class might learn to distinguish
between any of the 42 different
ways of saying "the" in German on
that day.
Meeting the emergency with more
than ordinary fortitude, the teacher
endeavored manfully, but unsuc
cessfully, to eject the canine. Coax
ing, threats, and gentle physical
persuasion failed alike. The hound,
though not quite as large as a mule,
made up for it in stubborness.
Exasperated (or perhaps wily) by
repeated failure, the instructor
finally said to the immovable dog,
"Well, if you want to stay here and
study German, go ahead and stay."
Galvanized into action as the
wcrds left the speaker's mouth, the
hound leaped over four pairs of
feet, shot through the door like a
projectile, and was seen no more.
