# Bonecrushers Steal Spotlight With Mat Bouts Tonight
## HARD MATCHES IN SIGHT AS 20 MEN VIE FOR 7 TITLES Exhibition Opens Wrestling With Taylor Favored For Heavy Crown 
### Maurice Rapf 
Wrestling takes the Pavilion lime
light at 8 o'clock tonight, when the
annual all-University mat cham
pionships get under way. Thirteen
matches have been scheduled to
settle the title and medal winners
of the seven weight divisions.
An exhibition between Dick
Gould and Don Tatum will open
the festivities. Spectators .should
come early as this is slated as one
of the best events on the evening's
card. Both men are in the unlimited j
weight group, weighing over 175 i
pounds. Gould will later compete |
against the winner of the Jack !
White-Bob Taylor match for the I
heavyweight title. Taylor has a !
deadly reverse headlock, and unless |
his opponents can devise a way to I
slip out of il, he should go through j
to a victory.
Ilolm-Janin Rated Even
Herb Holm will grapple with j
Louis Janin tor the 175-pound crown 1
in a match that is an absolute toss- [
up. Holm showed rugged endurance |
in his semi-final fight with Bill j
Perelli-Minetti on Tuesday. Janin, j
however, has a variety of holds in |
his bag of tricks, which makes him j
a tough customer at any stage of ;
the game.
There are three semi-finalists at j
IGS pounds, but Mario Perelli-Min- i
etti has drawn a bye to the finals, j
"Plug" Wright will meet Sked Peck j
in i regular match, the winner to |
take on Minetti. To even things up, j
Minetti will wrestle a six-minute j
exhibition with Don Kincaid.
Aggressive Wrestlers
Those who like fast wrestling will j
get a treat when Leonard Youdall j
and Winston Phillips tackle each 1
other for the 155-pound champion- j
.'hip. Youdall won an impressive j
victory over Eddie Moffatt in the i
.
p eiiminaries, while Phillips de
feated Bill Hewlett and Sam Glen, I
with an aggressive style of battling. I
Both semi-finals and finals will !
be run off in the 145-pound group, j
so that each grappler will have to j
compete in two matches. Carl Eitner ;
will meet his first competition in !
the wiry George Leaven, while Sam !
Clark and John Hitchcock will also
battle each other, with the winners
of these two matches meeting later j
in the evening.
Fast Mixers
Allen James and Ben Wilcoxon j
;rre the lightweight finalists. At 125
pounds, Ronald Morey and '"Wild
cat" Reynolds arc seeking the title
and the medal that goes with it.
These boys are not afraid to mix
things up, and this may turn out to
be one of the best bouts of the eve
ning.
