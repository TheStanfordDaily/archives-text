A good idea that won't work.
That seems to be the opinion of
1 the powers at Stanford concerning
' the perennial suggestion that St.
i Mary's, Santa Clara, and Sari Fran
! Cisco University be added to the
j southern division basketball con-
J ference.
The argument is advanced
that these teams are already in
the baseball league, and that by
admitting them to the basket
| ball conference, variety and in
terest will be added to the hoop
schedule.
I "Silent Sam" Barry, lie of the
| Southern California's stalling five,
: is one of the advocates of the plan.
He points out that these teams play
j conference members anyway, and
i that it would be a simple matter to
j make these games official.
That these three teams play ball
1 of a high calibre is evident from
j their records. Santa Clara, for in
-1 stance, this year defeated every col
i lege opponent except Stanford.
All of which sounGs very rosy,
but there are obstacles which Sam
i and other supporters of the plan
1 fail to take into consideration.
"I am agreeable to the pro
posal insofar as it gives variety
to conference competition and
increases the number of games
to be played," said Coach John
Bunn yesterday, "but the dif
ficulties to be faced in working
out such a scheme are probably
too large to make it a success."
Bunn grants, however, that
a conference of four teams is
. entirely too small.

The chief difficulty in the way of
the proposal is that of arranging a
schedule that would be acceptable
to ail of the schools. Five of the
teams would be in the North and
two in the South which would mean
that U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. would
have to do most of the traveling.
Barry probably wouldn't be so en
thusiastic about this point.
Then there is the financial ques
tion. Some of the games would not
draw large crowds and with more
long trips to be made between the
Bay district and Los Angeles, ex
penses would naturally increase.
Eligibility requirements must
also be considered. The three
schools in question would have
to raise their requirements to
meet those of the conference
before they could be admitted.
And this is quite unlikely.
The northern division might pre
sent another obstacle. Should one
of the new schools win the southern
division championship, it. is possible
that the winner in the North might
put up a squawk.
Now about this baseball business:
It is true that St. Mary's, S.F.U.,
and Santa Clara compete with Stan
ford and the rest in a league that
is apparently a success. But few
persons realize that this is not a
conference but purely an association
for the purpose of convenience in
arranging schedules.
The only eligibility rules en
forced are those concerning
professional ball players.

A good idea that won't work.
That seems to be the opinion of
1 the powers at Stanford concerning
' the perennial suggestion that St.
i Mary's, Santa Clara, and Sari Fran
! Cisco University be added to the
j southern division basketball con-
J ference.
The argument is advanced
that these teams are already in
the baseball league, and that by
admitting them to the basket
| ball conference, variety and in
terest will be added to the hoop
schedule.
I "Silent Sam" Barry, lie of the
| Southern California's stalling five,
: is one of the advocates of the plan.
He points out that these teams play
j conference members anyway, and
i that it would be a simple matter to
j make these games official.
That these three teams play ball
1 of a high calibre is evident from
j their records. Santa Clara, for in
-1 stance, this year defeated every col
i lege opponent except Stanford.
All of which sounGs very rosy,
but there are obstacles which Sam
i and other supporters of the plan
1 fail to take into consideration.
"I am agreeable to the pro
posal insofar as it gives variety
to conference competition and
increases the number of games
to be played," said Coach John
Bunn yesterday, "but the dif
ficulties to be faced in working
out such a scheme are probably
too large to make it a success."
Bunn grants, however, that
a conference of four teams is
. entirely too small.

The chief difficulty in the way of
the proposal is that of arranging a
schedule that would be acceptable
to ail of the schools. Five of the
teams would be in the North and
two in the South which would mean
that U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. would
have to do most of the traveling.
Barry probably wouldn't be so en
thusiastic about this point.
Then there is the financial ques
tion. Some of the games would not
draw large crowds and with more
long trips to be made between the
Bay district and Los Angeles, ex
penses would naturally increase.
Eligibility requirements must
also be considered. The three
schools in question would have
to raise their requirements to
meet those of the conference
before they could be admitted.
And this is quite unlikely.
The northern division might pre
sent another obstacle. Should one
of the new schools win the southern
division championship, it. is possible
that the winner in the North might
put up a squawk.
Now about this baseball business:
It is true that St. Mary's, S.F.U.,
and Santa Clara compete with Stan
ford and the rest in a league that
is apparently a success. But few
persons realize that this is not a
conference but purely an association
for the purpose of convenience in
arranging schedules.
The only eligibility rules en
forced are those concerning
professional ball players.
