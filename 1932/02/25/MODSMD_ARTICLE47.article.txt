# CARD POLO TEAM MEETS WILDCATS TODAY IN ARIZONA
## Fleming, Lewis, Gillham, Spalding Will Start For Stanford 
### 
After a short workout on the
Arizona field yesterday, the Card
inal polo team clashes with the
strong Wildcat four this afternoon
in the first of a two-game series.
Since decisively whipping the
Utah team last week, the Redshirt
riders have gained new confidence
and have strong hopes of finally
winning a match from Arizona.
Games in the past have seen the
Cardinals always nosed out by a
one- or two-goal margin. But with
this year's outfit showing more bril
liancy than any other in his'tory,
chances look indeed favorable to
overcome the jinx.
Starting the game for Stanford
are Gillham, Spuulding, Lewis, and
Fleming. All these men showed
plenty of flashiness in the Utah
series, and make a smooth-working
team defensively as well as pre
senting two scoring threats in
Spalding and Lewis.
Opposing them, however, is one
of the foremost collegiate teams in
the country. With an age-old repu
tation for strong polo teams, Ari
zona has attracted the cream of the
younger riders of the West. Weather
conditions, too, have been much
more favorable for the Wildcats
than for the more unfortunate In
dians. Daily practice has been pos
sible ever since school began at
Arizona, while at Stanford a rain
soaked field has made any fast
scrimmaging impossible since the
first of December.
After today's match, the Red
shirts will take a day's rest. The
second game of the series will be
played on Saturday.
