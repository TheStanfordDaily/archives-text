# Frosh Hoopmen Record 4 Wins
## Improvement Marks Basket Season Of Babes 
### 
Although Stanford's freshman
basketball team goes down on the
vocord books with four victories
against eleven defeats, the season
will ring as an unqualified success
by the persons who have followed
the freshman record.
Badly beaten by Palo Alto High
early in January, the yearlings
gained momentum while dropping
games to more experienced squads,
lost the Little Big Series to a much
taller California five, came back to
give the Stanford varsity a terrific
battle, and wound up the season
with a smashing victory over Rose
ville High.
Prospects Bad
When Coach Vance. Fawcett first
took up the yearling coaching reins
he faced the sorriest crop of fresh
man basketball players in more
than a decade. Before the first game
of the season against Palo Alto
! High, Rod Bost and Bob Moore, the
two most promising members of the
i squad, were forced to leave (he
!' team. Palo Alto won 15-7 in a dis
j mal contest, and on the following
| afternoon Pittsburg High nosed out
j the freshmen, 11-9.
j The following week-end the year
t lings played two games, losing 35-
: 22 to a brilliant St. Mary's freshman
| five on Friday, and coming back on
Saturday night to nose out the
! Stockton five, the strongest high-,
I school team in northern California,
i Two victories followed over Fresno
! High, but then the Indians hit a
i playing slump, and lost their next
J seven games, including two with the
i California freshmen.
Varsity Game
I The yearlings faced the last week
iof their season with all incentive
| seemingly gone. Early in the week
I Fawcett's team fought the Stanford
j varsity off its feet. In its final game
Fawcett's team ran roughshod ovfer
Roseville High. The 29-12 victory
gave the yearlings a season total of
291 points to 401 for their opposi
tion.
Wally Crowe, Tom Sales, and Tom
Kelly fought on a par for the cen
ter post all year, while Lory Roth
ert and Charles Coiner had a slight
| edge on the forward positions.
Henry Coiner, Frank Cox, and Jim
| Trompas gave them a battle all
j season.
Guards Good
Cordon Mallatratt and Joe Butte
â€¢ held down the guard posts through
i cut the season, although Johnny
! Mack and Jim Savage finished fast.
; Coach Vance Fawcett had the un
questionable distinction of having
Ito draw his material fronl the
i smallest class in the history of the
University. Thinking more of teach
' mg the game than piling up a win
j riitig record, Fawcett developed a
band of eighteen green men into
l teal basketball players.
