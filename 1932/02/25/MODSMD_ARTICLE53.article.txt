# W.A.A. HOOPSTERS OPPOSE SAN JOSE IN CLASS GAMES
## Card Women In Collegiate Competition Today For First Time 
### 
Handicapped by the fact that
; three-court instead of the two-
I court rules by which Stanford
I women have been playing this year
' will be used, the W.A.A. class bas
j ketball teams will meet San Jose
! State this afternoon in the first dual
intcrclass intercollegiate cage meet
in which Stanford women have ever
participated.
The dual meet is hailed as a great
forward step by W.A.A. officials,
since class teams will remain intact
and will compete with teams of
similar experience and training.
Formerly triangular meets were
held with Mills and California in
which teams composed of players
from any class and school were
thrown together to meet a team of
similar origin, eliminating any pos
sibility for team play or co-opera
tion.
Straight intercollegiate games
! have never been held because of
i the policy of the National Amateur
j Athletic Federation, of v/hich Stan
i ford is a member, v/hich frowns
! upon intercollegiate competition of*
j any sort as contrary to the stand
j ards of uncommercializeel athletics
J for women.
Because of lack of facilities, the
junior and senior games will be
pkyed here, wilh the first contest
scheduled to begin at 4 o'clock,
while freshman and sophomore
| teams will journey to San Jose.
