SYRIAN
LATAKIA
is one of the 5 fine tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS
Founder of the blend
Laiakia is what gives COLO
NEL ADAMS mixture that
"different" flavor.
!t is imported from Syria and
cured in the following unique
way:
The leaf is suspended from
the top of the native tents,
and a smudge f*rc is built on
the floor—The tobacco is thus
"smoked" to black hue, much
the same as ham and bacon is
prepared in a "smoke-house."
Like all the tobaccos in
COLONEL ADAMS our Lata
kia is aged from 1 to 5 years
before packing.
That's why COLO N E L
ADAMS is mild and sweet
and doesn't bite your tongue
like unseasoned tobacco.
