# ENGLISH COSTUMES QUEER SPECTACLE
## 
### 
To see a student walking about
| the campus, clad in high silk top-
I per, Buster Browncollar, short tail
j jacket, and black patent-leather
i shoes with spats would create con
! siderable mirth, but on the grounds
j of the English prep schools, this cos-
J tume is practically required.
The Oxford and Cambridge stu
i dent would be shocked to see a
j "rough'' attend classes in his shirt
sleeves and dirty corduroy trousers.
| At the English universities, a dark
i colored suit with a neutral colored
i tie has become the traditional garb,
; while heavy overcoats, spats and
! derbies, are also worn.
