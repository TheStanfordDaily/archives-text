Walk, who lives at Toyon and is |

j of fashion with his "Ascot Model"
j shirt. The design is remarkable, i
| both for its simplicity and its utter
i serviceability. There is nothing in- |
! tricate about it. Merely a shirt in
which the collar, instead ending
| itself in the traditional points, |
! shrinks to half its width, elongates I
i and becomes a necktie, too.
! All the rough-in-a-hurry ha.» to '
do to be fully dashed and habered j
J is to pull it on, fasten the single J
button, loop one end of the collar- j
tie over the other, Ascot fashion, ,
I and put on his coat. If he doesn't i
i like ihe Ascot lie, he can go ahead j
i and tie a knot just as he usually !
I does, without having to worry about '
j getting the two ends adjusted to the
' right length.
True, for dress occasions of the j
i highest order, when the male likes J
' to astound or delight the feminine ,
I curiosity by flaunting a dashing, i
j flashing, brilliant tie, or when he |
[wants to be a he-man and go with
| out a neckpiece, the Ascot is un
j suited. But for a work-a-day uni
: form it's the "dough," and no mis
