Since Nifty Phil Moffatt left the |
campus, Farm athletes have lost a
large part ol their sartorial distinc- j
tion. Moffatt, with his deep maroon j
knickers, flashy gray fllannels, and
smooth sweaters in the very smart- |
est style, and other component parts |
cf the fashionable college man's en- |
semble, gave Stanford teams that ■
touch of social distinction that is i
essential to the best grade of inter- 1
collegiate competitors.
Being gone, Phil leaves the torch ,
of elcgance to a variety of success- 1
ors. The golfers, Hellmann, Seaver,
Eichelberger, ct. al., have perhaps
the best claim to the title. General
observation on the Quad does not
reveal any serious competitors.
Block "S" sweaters and cords re
main de rigeur for baseball, foot
ball, and track heroes, although the j
graduate athletes sometimes don a j
coat above the cords. Polo men in !
their riding breeches produce a
swanky effect, but, since these are
the accounterments of their sport,
they do not qualify technically for
the rank of best-dressed athletes.
Until another Moffatt comes along
the leadership must be left vacant.
