Sharkskin and luggage pigskin
! mark the season's change in campus
and semi-sports shoes for men.
i These two new materials are highly
sturdy, soft and washable. White
| pigskin is replacing the old favorite
| buck in sports shoes, on the grounds
that it is easier to wash. Certainly
' the white pig is a smart material to
! look at, and reassuring as to wear,
j after years of experience with pig
' skin luggage and gloves which en
i dureth all.
The new sharkskin is interesting
las a nubbly brown and dark traced
I surface, with sleek brown saddle,
i The astonishing thing, besides its
; appeal as actual skin of the deep-
I sea tiger, is that it is guaranteed to
outwear and outshape even pigskin.
Punched moccasins and many
) brogues approach with the warm
| season. Rubber heels are frowned
j upon. The best-looking and most
I expensive shoes are noted with all â€”
j leather heels. Crepe and treaded
I soles are universal as ever. A new
sole made of compressed wool im
pregnated with rubber has come
onto the market. It is light-weight,
cool and long-wearing.
Men's dressier shoes are still
! trending more to the narrow, point
! Ed outline.
