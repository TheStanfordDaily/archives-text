# CARDINAL MEN YET HAT WARY DESPITE BALLYHOO'S PLEAS
## 
### 
[ In spite of "Ballyhoo's" campaign !
' for the wearing of more and better j
} hats, the men still stalk about the;
''Farm" with their locks flowing in J
the breeze. However, more and more ,
| students are beginning to top off I
; their sartorial equipment with a j
| chapeau for a date in the city.
Prominent among the popular col
| ors cf men's hats this spring will be
! grey, blue-grey, and tan. Light buff
j and the new peach tan will be espe
| cially favored in campus circles, it is [
believed by style forecasters. How
ever, forest green will be worn with
I camel hair top coats.
Hats will be much the same in re- j
j gard to shape and will be very light !
I in weight. Small brims will continue
[ to be favored and bands will be wide
I with a new folded or pleated bow.
