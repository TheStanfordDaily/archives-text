# CHINESE REGAIN GROUND WON IN JAPANESE DRIVE
## Gunfire Slackens As War Supplies Run Low On Kiangwan Front 
### 
SHANGHAI, Feb. 2G. (/?)—An irt
tense artillery action started at
dawn today in the Kiangwan sector,
but the Japanese were doing most
of the firing, for Chinese ammuni
tion was running low and gunners
had orders to use it sparingly.
The ammunition problem was be
ginning to worry General Tsai
Ting-kai, commander of the 19th
Chinese Route Army, who told
friends he had less than a fort
night's supply. The General urged
that pressure be exerted on the
Nanking government to rush men
and munitions.
Shell Jap Posts
SHANGHAI, Feb. 26. (/P) — The
.Chinese army, steadied by its suc
cess yesterday in recovering from a
rout and gaining back by desperate
fighting much ground that had been
lost when the Japanese smashed the
line north of Kiangwan, turned to
day to the Japanese strongholds in
Hongkew Park and punished them
with a vicious artillery bombard
ment.
Japanese guns answered shell for
shell. Before daybreak the thunder
of artillery and the crash of projec
tiles was unceasing.
Chinese Hold Town
The Japanese fire was concen
trated on the enemy positions in the
ruins of Chapei, and the sky was
alight with the flames of new fires
started by the bombardment.
The Chinese still held Kiangwan
this morning, although it almost fell
from their grasp in yesterday's
fighting.
