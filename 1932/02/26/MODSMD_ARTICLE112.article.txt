# TRAINED CORDS SHOWN Jacket Makes Rough Happy ENTIRELY CORDUROY

"Styles may come and styles may
j go, but cords go on forever." Thus
| sings the Stanford rough as he wipes
his fountain pen on his tiousers and
thus also sings the Power that sets
I style as he features the same old
cords at the same old price again
this spring.
Although apparently the same as
| of yore as to fabric and shape, this
spring's cords have certain unquali-
I lied advantages. For one thing, they
have been taught to stand up by
| themselves from the moment of their
purchase, thus relieving the buyer
of the usual three week's training
period. They are also quick-drying,,
i which is particularly advantageous
; to those who can't canoe, but go
l canoeing, anyway.
| It may be comforting to the cord
' clad rough to reflect that his lower
j cords need no longer suffer the
! celibate life. A companion-piece, a
| matching corduroy jacket, has been
j devised, similar in color and style j
to the suede jackets though featur
ing the undoubted advantage of a
i lower price.
The new cord jacket fastens with ;
buttons, and is corduroy through
! out, with no knitted collar or bor
j der; the cut ip hrief. Corduroy vests
arc suspected as bait for fall.
