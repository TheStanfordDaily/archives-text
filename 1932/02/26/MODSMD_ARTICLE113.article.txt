# PERFECT PRECISION TO MARK SMARTLY DRESSED ARMY MEN
## 
### 
Iron-clad rules of the U.S. Army
permit small leeway in spring gear
for Stanford's military men. Nigh
onto-perfect precision therefore
takes rank as the top ambition of ;
smart officers on the campus.
Boots boast the most liberality for
personal selection. Dark brown boots
of 18-inch height will be chosen by
most horsemen who seek to smarten
their equipment. Wrinkled boots
are frowned upon, and good quality
of leather becomes increasingly im
portant.
To add that necessary touch of
dash and daring, spurs should be
added. A modernistic spur of sharp
angles is challenging the conven
tional army style this yeai - , the latter
being plain, unadorned, with one
and one-half inch rounded prong.
To be really fashionable, one must j
wear chain in place of the yeoman's
leather strap under the instep. These j
chains are preferably of silver.
The well-groomed horse must also 1
present something of a styleplate.
Close clipping will follow the warm
er weather. Legs of the polo mount
may be left, undipped, as a trifle
more protection is afforded from Lhe
misdirected swings of a mallet.
Dull triple voile is becoming e
popular spring blouse fabric. Sleeve
puffs, pintucked bodice insert end
ing in two back points, and a soft j
tie are new points.
