# VENTILATED SOCKS NEW AID TO ROUGH
## 
### 
The rough's ankle should be a
thing of beauty this spring as sock
designers are offering a product that
rivals neckwear in so far as novelty
and unusual styling goes.
There is a definite lean toward the
French motif in fancy socks, and the
English styles of the last season are
definitely on the wane. For example,
the six-and-three-rib socks that
have been produced, and other ideas,
developed are being discontinued.
Harris tweeds and flannels in blue
gray and tan worsted lead in sports
wear for men. Special woven ties in
.contrasting colors will be worn with
these suits.
