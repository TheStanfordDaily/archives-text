# TWO-SWEATER VOGUE Style Has Practical Side GOOD FOR COLD DAYS
## 
### 
On those back-watering spring
days, when the wind whistles up
sunny Market Street in the city,
and you're walking from the Chem
Building to the Row, it is the man
who is two-sweater conscious who
is smartly and sensibly dressed.
The two-sweater vogue had its
beginning in Hornbrook, and was
brought to the Farm last year by a
junior transfer from Humboldt
State Teachers College, at Arcada.
This fashion was rather one of
horse-sense than of fad, for the
nights are cold at Arcada, and the
mornings—well, where is the morn
ing dew so damp as at Arcada?
Once introduced at Stanford, the
two-sweater rage spread rapidly.
Every man who had two sweaters —
and the best people have two
sweaters, you know—wore both of
them at once.
With the advent of spring, two
sweaterism is increasing its hold on
the manly chest.
The style has its practical aspects.
After a while two sweaters become
so attached to each other that only
one "up-and-over" movement is
necessary to don or doff both. Then,
when the exterior sweater becomes
slightly soiled, the order may be
reversed, and there you have the
upper half of your, clothing problem
solved for another month.
