### 
Lingerie for spring is as cool and
.comfortable as ever, and follows the
Empire trend, fitting closely, and
having not an iota of extra fullness
to mar the fashionably smooth ex
ternal effect.
Garments made partly of rayon
are cooler than those of all silk.

Some sport sets
are being shown
in soft, cottony
materials with
tiny printed pat
terns. The new
all-in-one gar
ments are mar-

vels of compact completeness, and
with their low-cut backs are well
adapted to wear with formal gowns.
Slips are daintily embroidered,
but the use of bulky lace is avoided.
The newest ones are made with an
extremely waist line, empha
sizing the upward-molded silhou
ette.
-ins are completely out of the
race, being replaced by carefully
modeled shorts. The newest of these
have no elastic at all, but a smooth
band across the back and a shallow
side opening.
Dainty new night gowns are very
attractive with their fitted waist
lines, long flaring skirts, lacy trim
mings, and ribbon sashes, in every
color under the sun.
