# Coaches Individual In Clothing Styles

### 
In football, baseball., golf, tennis, '
; basketball, polo, swimming, track— ,
1 yes, in every sport on the books
players have special types of garb
! that are subject to the changing j
| styles.
But the men who direct the des
tinies of sport, the coaches, have no
\ set style of clothing, and it is doubt- j
j ful that outfits worn by many of our :
| athlete leaders have changed in the ,
! past ten seasons.
Coaches Unique
Individuality in dress, that's your
coafh. Take the lot of them here on
the farm, and you'll get an idea of j
what we mean.
First, of course, comes the grand :
I old man of football—Pop Warner,
who has probably seen more styles \
! in sport come and go than any one
; else hereabouts, unless it be Harry ;
1 Maloney, another veteran.
Knickers for Pop
Pop's habitual garb on the prac- j
lice field is just a plain dark suit, !
! an ordinary pair of brown oxfords,
; and an old, battered brown hat. Oc
pasionally, however, the Old Fox j
i turns up in golfing apparel, with a
! pair of rather flashy knickers, a j
downright startling striped sweater
and equally eye-hitting socks.
Dink's sweaters always match his
; "Dapper Dink" is the stylist of them
| all. Usually in very smart-looking
knickers, the boy coach of America
| tops them off with a fancy x'ed jacket
; that the average college lad would !
; term "just about the berries."
Dink's sweaters allways match his

socks—and his tics are seldom out
ol' harmony. He prefers two-toned
oxfords, and always wears a particu
larly rakish hat — usually brown—
though ho must have a dozen in dit- j
i'erent colors. A master of track,
Dink is just as much a master of
style.

On the basketball court we find
another coach who looks just about
"right" lor every practice session.. |
John Bunn wears a nifty-looking
pair of sweat pants, the latest in i
basketball shoes, and a red jacket
that rivals even Dink's famed one
for fanciness. Cardinal, of course,
it is made of heavy wool, has a large
collar, and is equipped with a couple
of white pockets in front that are j
almost large enough to hold basket- !
balls.
