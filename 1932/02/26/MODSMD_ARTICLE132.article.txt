# Card Nine Tackles Santa Clara Tomorrow
## BRONC SERIES IS EVEN AS SQUADS ENTER THIRD TILT Anderson Draws Mound Job, Livermore To Catch In Crucial Game 
### Bob Wade 
Two won, two lost, and fourteen
to go! With the conference race still
in its infancy, the Stanford varsity
baseball team goes up against Santa
Clara in the last of their annual
three-game series Saturday at 2:30
o'clock on the Farm field.
The Indians so far have failed to
show much of the form that brought
them their first championship last
year, even though they have a ma
jority of veterans in this year's out
fit. The outfield has shown up well,
and the pitchers have been fair, but
the infield has developed the habit
of booting the ball just when the
pitchers have been in the worst
holes.
Last year the Redshirts started
their Southern trip with a clean
recordâ€”six straight victories. This
year, supposing that they win the
next two contests, the best that they
can leave with is four victories and
two defeats. Granted ihat both
Santa Clara and St. Mary's have
much stronger teams this year, the
Cards are nevertheless doing them
selves little good by dropping early
season games.
With this in mind, about the only
consolation the Indians can find in
their early season performance so
far is the fact that Santa Clara
trounced California in its first game
Wednesday, 8-3.
Coach Harry Wolter will start
Stan Anderson on the mound, and
probably Livermore behind the
plate. The rest of the line-up is the
same that has started the league
games so far: Goodell at first,
Philippi on second, Trautman at
third, Delmas at short, and Gold
mann, Rintala, and Campbell in the
outfield.
