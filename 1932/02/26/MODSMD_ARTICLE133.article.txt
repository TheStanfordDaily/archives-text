WATSON, WHAT the hell da you |
make of this? Here's an advertise
ment which appeared in the Los
Angeles Herald-Express last Satur
day:
1IEY! TROJANS!
Ernie Pinckcrt and Johnnie Baker
Will Be Guests of Honor at the
CLUB ALABAM
4105 South Central
TONIGHT!
Get the Tables, Boys!
Now this exclusive club is a col- ]
ored cafe in the dusky section of j
Los Angeles. And a couple of alum- j
ni postcard in to say that friend j
Johnnie had participated in the i
U.S.C.-Occidental track meet that j
same afternoon.
Now really!
. ... ... j
MAYBE THIS is an idea, at that. |
, Dinah's could make arrangements
for Ben Eastman to run four kips j
around their dance floor each Sat- !
urday night. And the Lido could j
get Bill Corbus to sing a solo—and j
maybe demonstrate how the new ;
football rules will work out.
Doubtless the Bal Tarbarin would i
be glad to secure the services of !
Harry Hillman for a tap dance i
number. And surely the Mark or I
the Frantic would be benefited by !
personal appearances by "Tiny j
Tom" Cordry, the Hables brothers, j
and Keith Gledhill.
y*. .
THE CIRCUS comes back to j
the Oakland "800 Pavilion," as
William Lciscr so coyly terms
it.
If you want to see the wildest
basketball a wild season could '

| produce—
If you want to hear the
mightiest boos that only such a
game could inspire—
If you want to learn all (he
latest ways for presenting the
bird, the Bronx huzzah and the
old-fashioned razzberry—
If. incidentally, you want to
see the southern division bas
| kcthall champion crowned—
Then try to squeeze your way
into the Oakland Auditorium to
morrow night, where Nibs
Price's ruffians will meet Sam
Barry's thugs in the playoff for
southern division honors.
! THAT LAST meeting of the Ruf
! fians and the Thugs was no place
| for weak hearts. Some 10,000 fans
| trickled out of the place limp as the
1 proverbial dish-rag after the game,
i It was one "Sonny" Anderson, a
j totally unknown substitute, who
| settled the issue in the last 10 sec
j onds, sinking a free throw to break
; a tie and score his only point of the
I season—but what a point!
I Regular lineups are expected to
! start tomorrow night: Kintana and
j Eifert or Seifert, forwards; Read,
I center; Vendt and Crowley, guards,
! for California. Nemer and Gardner,
j forwards; Pierce, center; Capps and
| Bescos, guards, for Southern Cali
-Ifornia.
And don't.be late—there will
be no reserved scats, and it will
be a case of first come, first
served. The main show will be
gin at S o'clock, with a fresh
man sideshow scheduled for
' 6:30 o'clock. —L.M.C. *

Ernie Pinckcrt and Johnnie Baker
Will Be Guests of Honor at the
CLUB ALABAM
4105 South Central
TONIGHT!
Get the Tables, Boys!
Now this exclusive club is a col- ]
ored cafe in the dusky section of j
Los Angeles. And a couple of alum- j
ni postcard in to say that friend j
Johnnie had participated in the i
U.S.C.-Occidental track meet that j
same afternoon.
Now really!
. ... ... j
MAYBE THIS is an idea, at that. |
, Dinah's could make arrangements
for Ben Eastman to run four kips j
around their dance floor each Sat- !
urday night. And the Lido could j
get Bill Corbus to sing a solo—and j
maybe demonstrate how the new ;
football rules will work out.
Doubtless the Bal Tarbarin would i
be glad to secure the services of !
Harry Hillman for a tap dance i
number. And surely the Mark or I
the Frantic would be benefited by !
personal appearances by "Tiny j
Tom" Cordry, the Hables brothers, j
and Keith Gledhill.

THE CIRCUS comes back to j
the Oakland "800 Pavilion," as
William Lciscr so coyly terms
it.
If you want to see the wildest
basketball a wild season could '

| produce—
If you want to hear the
mightiest boos that only such a
game could inspire—
If you want to learn all (he
latest ways for presenting the
bird, the Bronx huzzah and the
old-fashioned razzberry—
If. incidentally, you want to
see the southern division bas
| kcthall champion crowned—
Then try to squeeze your way
into the Oakland Auditorium to
morrow night, where Nibs
Price's ruffians will meet Sam
Barry's thugs in the playoff for
southern division honors.
! THAT LAST meeting of the Ruf
! fians and the Thugs was no place
| for weak hearts. Some 10,000 fans
| trickled out of the place limp as the
1 proverbial dish-rag after the game,
i It was one "Sonny" Anderson, a
j totally unknown substitute, who
| settled the issue in the last 10 sec

; a tie and score his only point of the
