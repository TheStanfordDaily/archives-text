# Babe Trackmen In Farm Debut
## Field Trip, Ineligible List Decrease Material 
### Albert Guerard 
A new crop of future WykyfTs
makes its Farm debut at 10:30
o'clock tomorrow morning when the
Stanford yearling track team meets
a picked group of San Francisco
high-school stars in the Old Oval.
A geology, field trip and the old
bugaboo of all coaches, the ineligi
ble list, will make a big dent in
Bill Ellington's material, and may
prove enough to enable the San
Franciscans to win.
Claude McWilliams, Commerce
High negro star, has threatened
world's records on more than one
occasion, but having concerned
himself entirely with basketball so
far this year, will probably find Al
Blackmail a bit too fast.
Ward Vincent, Walt Harris, and
possibly Bob Blown will run the
440, and all three should get under
55 seconds, while Dave Devlin, who
usually runs the longer grinds, Un
derbill, Girvin, and Downing will
take care of the 880. They should
be able to take five or six points
against the all-stars. Phil Morentin
will win the mile run, unless he
breaks a leg or two, because none
of the prep runners have ap
proached Phil's best mark of 4:31.
In the absence of Sales and
Munro, Frank Bowles, Andy
Bright, Aylett Cotton, and Robert
Buffum will take care of the tim
ber-topping events, with Bowles
conceded a good chance to win the
high hurdles.
