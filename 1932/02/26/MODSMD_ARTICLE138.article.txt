# Track Team Holds Last Pre-Season Meet Today
## Varsity Weak In Mile And High Jump; Prepare For Winged 'O' Meet 
### 
By Dick Strouse
I In preparation for the opening
â€¢ meet of the season with the Olym-
I pic Club a week from Saturday,
; Stanford's tracksters will hold the
j last pre-season practice meet of the
: year this afternoon.
To date, the Indians have not
! shown that they possess a really
| good miler. Bob Atkinson and Sam
i Eastman both failed to break 4:40
j last week, and Jim Ferric did not
! run, as he chose to start his vaca
i tion a day early. The performances
! of these three men tomorrow in the
1 three-lap race (three-quarter dis-
I tances will be run in the longer
j track events) will have considerable
; bearing on Indian prospects this
j year.
The high-jump is the other event
' in which the varsity has looked bad
Iso far. Both Don Blackman and
; Penny Austin are capable of better
j than six feet, but neither has sur
i passed five feet nine inches this
| year.
There is a chance that Dan
! Murphy and Horse Guittard will be
lin shape for the first time this
! quarter. In his first bit of competi
! tion since he hurt his shoulder, Bill
; Werder broad-jumped 22 feet 3
i inches in that interclass affair,
i which was about an inch better
| than Wally Butler's best.
