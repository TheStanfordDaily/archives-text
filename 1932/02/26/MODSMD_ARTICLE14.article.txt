Girzi Plays Sponge
An actor who should be especially
rrientioned is Edward Girzi, who has
a role that is wonderfully fitted to
his technique. He will play Rene
St. Gall, the blubbering social
sponge.
Although the whole play is laid in
a refined English country home, it
reeks occasionally of the barnyard,
and there are numerous references
to the poultry department.
Because of the length of Saki's
farce, "Hie Mistress of Briony," the
curtain will be drawn tonight at
8:15 o'clock instead of at the usual
later hour.
Good tickets for the fastest com
edy lhat has been produced here
since "Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh" are
still obtainable at the dramatic
manager's office in the Old Union,
and the box office will be open to
night. The price range for reserved
seats is from $1.25 to 75 cents.
Collins 3las Lead
Barbara Collins, who has only
been seen in minor roles up until*
now, will play the dominant char
acter of the play—Hortensia. Hor
tensia is the ruling mistress of
Briony, and the whole point of the
play is the getting of her son Trevor,
played by Terence Geddis, married
to someone who will make Briony
livable again. The result is, of
course, a surprise ending.
But Saki (H. H. Monroe) doesn't
forget the classical ideal in the
writing of "The Mistress of Briony."
The unities of time, place, and tone
are maintained throughout. The first
acl takes place in the late morning,
the second, that evening, and the
third, the next morning.
