# INDIANS TO MEET STAR S.F. NETMEN IN RETURN MATCH
## Gledhill Withdrawn From Tomorrow's Contest; Start At 1:30 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
By far the toughest set of matches
) the Indian netmen will have to face
j this season, tomorrow's California
| Tennis Club fracas at 1:30 o'clock
1 on the varsity courts will serve as
I a real strength test. Some of the
j slate's highest ranking players arc
| taking the courts for the Club —
J among them Bud Chandler, num
' ber one in California, and Jerry
! Stratford, Ed Levy, and Phil Neer,
! second, fourth, and fifth, respec
] tively. Gledhill is ranked the state's
: third best.
Two weeks ago the varsity net
i sters took an official 5-2 beating at
the hands of the Clubmen, although
the actual score was 5-4, since
Gledhill's double win counted only
as exhibition play. The same official
lack of Gledhill will hold tomorrow,
j but the true indication of standing
, will be given by the total team
I score, regardless of the captain's
| self-chosen withdrawal.
Gledhill v/ill provide the feature
of the day by taking on Chandler
in the main singles match, and
stands an excellent chance of
| walking off the courts with a vic-
I tory. Two weeks ago Gledhill took
' ihe California Club first man in
| 6»4, 8-6 fashion. Chandler, how
| ever, defeated Vines in Berkeley
j last Saturday, by a 6-3, 8-6 count,
; while the national champion hum-
I bled Gledhill the next day, 6-3, 6-3.
Joe Coughlin will face Stratford,
whom he conquered in a tough 6-4,
! 3-6, 0-7 battle last time, and Chuck
i Otis, third man, v/ill try a come
; back act with Levy. The latter took
j a 6-4, 6-1 match from the Cardinal
I two weeks ago.
