# TAYLOR TAKES QUICK VICTORY IN MAT BOUTS
## Janin Triumphs Over Holm With Fluke Decision; Phillips On Top 
### 
By Maurice Rapf
Bob Taylor applied the reverse
■ to an ordinary headlock last
j night in the Pavilion, and won his
| way through the semi-finals and;
' finals of the all-University wrestling
j championships to take the heavy
! weight title.
Tipping the scales at 218 pounds,
the new champion had a decided
weight advantage over both his op
ponents, Jack White and Dick Gould.
White managed to evade the deadly
i headlock for a short time, but Taylor
eventually got his right arm around
his opponent's head and neck and
! the match was over in a little more
! than two minutes.
Shortest Match
In the final fight of the evening,
| Dick Gould could not do as well in
grappling with Taylor. He slipped
into the champion's hold at the out
set and his shoulders were brought >
to the mat in 35 seconds, the short- ;
j est win of the evening. Gould had I
I previously wrestled a no-decision j
exhibition with Don Tatum.
Herb Holm licked himself in a *
fight with Louis Janin for the 175-
pound crown. The two men had j
battled on even terms for two min
utes, when Holm unconsciously let
his shoulders fall flat upon the mat.
The referee immediately tapped
Janin and gave him the victory.
Wright Loses
Bill Wright staited out as if he
meant business against Mario Pe
relli-Minetti, at 165 pounds, but Pe
relli-Minctti had different ideas, and
pinned Wright's shoulders to the
! mat in one minute and five seconds. !
The loser won his semi-final clash j
with Sked Peck.
The most exciting and closely con
-1 tested encounter of the evening was ;
for the 155-pound title, when Win
ston Phillips won by a fait- over
i Leonard Youdall in 7 minutes and
j 17 seconds. The men wasted no time I
, in getting started and were rolling I
lon the mat within a few seconds j
i after the opening bell. Phillips was '
in sevei'al tight spots during the
i course of the fight, but he always i
managed to work himself lose. It was |
I all over when he got his half-Nelson
on Youdall after six minutes of the
fight had elapsed.
Decision Bout
Carl Eilner's wrestling experience
gave him a four minute time ad
vantage victory over the powerfully
built gymnast, Sam Clark, for the
145-pound titie. Eitner scored a j
i three-minute fall over George Leav- i
len in the semi-finals, while Clark
took a time advantage victory over j
Johnny Hitchcock in a thrilling j
j match that was even most of the ;
j way.
It tok Allen James 5 minutes and 1
I 25 seconds to down Ben Wilcoxon in ■
j the 135 pound finals, but the fall
| could just as well have come in the j
! first minute. The outcome was never
in doubt.
The first two minutes of the Ron 1
j Morey-Wildcat Reynolds match went
without either man touching the j
j canvas, but 25 seconds after the sec- !
' ond period had begun, Morey slip- |
! ped over a quick fall on his oppo
nent to win the 125-pound title.
