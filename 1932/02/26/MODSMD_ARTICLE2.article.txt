### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. (/P) â€”
Secretary Hurley was profanely as
sailed today for declining to appear
before a House group.
When Representative J. P. Scha
fer moved that the Secretary be
asked to come in person to a build
ing works parley, an objection was
raised that such a request might
embarrass Hurley.
Schafer answered, "To hell with
him!"
