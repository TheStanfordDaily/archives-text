# Results Of Irish Vote Stabilizing Professor Says
## Can Disregard History In Present Situation 
### Frances Johnson 
"In spite of his past, I think we
need not expect any radical action
lYom De Valera and his party," was
the comment of Carl Brand, asso
ciate professor of history, on the
recent Irish elections, which have
put the revolutionary Fianna Fail
i party in power,
"Office always has a sobering ef
fect, and circumstances are such
! that a vote lor De Valera does not
i necessarily mean a vote for extreme
Republicanism and separation from
England," declared Brand. He went
I on to point out that the people put
the responsibility for the depression
and unemployment on the conser
vative party in power, and that by
waging a campaign of extreme mod
eracy De Valera had obtained a
bare plurality in the Irish Parlia
ment. The very small Labor party,
; which is against further relinquish
! ment of the English tie, holds the
balance of power; and also agricul
tural interests are not in favor of
the economic independence of Ire
' land, which Do Valera and the
| revolutionaries have advocated
! heretofore.
He characterized De Valera's abo
lition of the oath of allegiance to
Ihe crown as "a gesture which will
undoubtedly please his more radical
supporters." It is of no great con
stitutional significance, however,
| since De Valera has pledged him
j self to take no further constitu
i tional step without a further nian
! date from the people.
"This new situation may be a '
stabilizing factor," was Brand's final
I view of the matter, "and perhaps
I Ireland will now enjoy a normal
j constitutional political life with a ,
I two party situation. Since the
i Anglo-Irish treaty of 1922 the mod
; crate party, advocating co-operation
, with England, has been in power,
and it is not a satisfactory condi
i tion when there is only one con
stitutional government party and
I when the only opposition must
; carry the stigma of being a party
! of violence."
