# Trustee Board Expands Lower Division By 100
## Action Will Not Necessitate Material Increase In Instructing Staff; Total Registration To Be Maintained At About Same Level 
### 
| L 1 OLLOWIN(i up last week's action retaining the Lower Division, thtr
I Board of Trustees at a special meeting in San Francisco yesterday
made provision in the budget lor an increase of 100 in the number of new
students of lower division standing admitted in October 1!).')2. The action
last week vested in the administrative officers of the University authority
to determine the amount of increase.
Acting-President Robert E. Swain's report on the meeting continues:
"This action, which has the approval of President Ray Lyman Wilbur, is
based upon a recent survey of the income available for University pur
poses and of the anticipated total registration for next year. At the
present time the number of students in undergraduate standing is less
than that ol last year, thus reflecting a condition which prevails in many

â€¢ <>f ihe endowed universities of the
! country, although there has been a
i notable increase in the number of
; students in graduate standing at
, i Stanford this year.
i "In view of this decrease in un-'
dergraduate registration it now ap
pears possible to accommodate 100
additional matriculants in the Low
er Division without overcrowding
the available facilities or adding
: materially to the instructing staff of
| the University.
i "This action will help to maintain
the total registration at about its
present level and provide for an ef
fective u.se of the facilities now en
gaged in undergraduate instruction.
It represents no backward step in
the program of the University and
no detraction from the scholarly
work which is being done in teach
ing and graduate research in ad
vanced and graduate lines."
