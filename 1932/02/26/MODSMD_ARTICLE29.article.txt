# ONE HUNDRED MORE

Following closely upon the heels of tlie Hoard of Trus
tees' action last Thursday to maintain and increase the
Lower Division, is the passing of a recommendation of
Acting-president Robert K. Swain hv the Board last night
to increase the Lower Division matriculates 100 next fall
quarter, raising Ihe total to !.")().
At last the t'nivcrsity, sickened by the sfendy drainage
of the Lowei vision, which is the life-blood of the insti
tution, is on its way to recovery.
Nor is this increase necessarily the limit. The original
resolution passed last week provides for the raising of the
number of incoming Lower Division students as the facili
ties of the University permit. With the passing of the de
pression the funds of the I'niversity will swell, permitting
greater and greater expansion.
Throughout its whole 10 years of existence Stanford has
been at a disadvantage in competition against the larger
uni\ersities. Although neither this increase nor further con
templated increases will raise the I'niversity to the size of
such schools as California, l .S.C. or Washington, students,
alumni and supporters can now escape the feeling that all
activities of this school except scholastic are being slowly
strau 'ed out of existence.

ll would not, though, ho wise to throw open the doors
;m<{ admit all comers who had the minimum number of
required recommendations. Much of Stanford's strength
has been in its oxclusiveness, its unification and its high
standards, which are only possible because of its high en
trance requirements and small enrollment.
rhe action of the Hoard last night will give new life to
Stanford, and all concerned will realize that this is a uni
versity and not merely a training school for professions.
