lOne of Stanford's chief claims to fame, or perhaps to
notoriety in this case, is the utter disregard of its students
I for "w hat the well-dressed co-eds and college lads will
wear on the campus." Therefore many may fliul a touch of
humor in the very idea of a fashion edition of The Daily.
Let it be known once and for all that The Daily is not
and probably never will be considering a campaign to re
form the students in matters of campus dress. It still
stands, as il lias down through the ages, squarely behind
the time-honored rough, whether male or otherwise.
Seriously, though, the problems of correct attire and of
opportunity purchases are probably more real ones to stu
dents here than on any other campus. Their very care
lessness in class-attending garb seems to instill in them a
super-sensitive fastidiousness in appearance oft'campus.
This issue, an innovation in Daily history, is offered
with sincere hopes that it can prove of value. Look it over;
iI may help you.
