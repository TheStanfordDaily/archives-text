# A 						NEW CROP COMING UP?
## 
### 
II is with the calculating eye of an athletic coach or big
league baseball scout that The Daily views the influx of
high school delegates lo Ihe California Scholastic Press As
sociation convention, which will be held on the campus to
morrow. Comprising Ihe cream of California's high school
journalists, this gathering contains much material that The
Daily would like to see in Ihe ranks of its trvoulees next
year.
Now that Ihe Lower Division is definitely with us to
stay the prospect that some of these high school luminaries
will crash Ihe Stanford scholastic gates is distinctly more
promising than it has been for some time. Nevertheless,
following its .>licy of always giving Ihe students a win
ning newspaper, The Daily does not intend to reduce ils
appropriation for subsidizing and proselyting. Star new
reporters will still be allowed lo pay $3 apiece for the staff
banquet, and rushing activities at tomorrow's convention
will not be curtailed.
However, whether or nol the delegates plan lo launch a
journalistic career here, The Daily is glad to see them and
hereby welcomes them to Ihe Farm, hoping lhal fhev will
pick up a modicum of useful in formal ion and will enjoy
their visit.
