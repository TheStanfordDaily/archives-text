Editor, Stanford Daily:
EUGENE, Ore., Feb. 25.—Here at the University of Ore
gon must be where film producers get their ideas about rah- i
rah college life. More women than men make the campus
co-ed conscious. Women jam the place and with cordiality
do abound. They use more rouge than the "500" and need it. i
Week-end lockouts here are at twelve-fifteen, but are often j

unofficially extended via open first-story sorority windows

They say Oregon is broker, and yet soap is found in the
men's washrooms at the library, which is more than Stanford
can boast. Professors watch students writing examinations
here, but general opinion claims that cheating of the non- :
flagrant variety goes on just the same.—Abe Mellinkoff.
