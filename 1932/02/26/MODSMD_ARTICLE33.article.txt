TIIE GUARDSMAN—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne,
the two Theatre Guild stars im
ported by M.G.M., make "The
Guardsman" one of the outstanding
' pictures of the year, and one which
had a record run in New York City.
The plot is nothing. An actor, jeal
ous of his actress-wife, learns of
the lure which uniforms hold for
her and disguises himself as a
guardsman, and through a series of
incidents tests her fidelity to him.
; The denouement is thoroughly
amusing, if not surprising.
But (he thing about this picture
is the inimitable duo who play the
leading characters. They are superb.
Lunt, by virtue of his role, has the
better opportunities, but Fontanne
looks lovely, acts to perfection, and
has one of the screen's most charm
ing voices. Lunt excells at panto
mime, and the scenes in which he
is testing his wife's faithfulness are
a joy to behold. By all means see
this, if you enjoy consummate act-

! ing, sophisticated dialogue, and a i
1 gay story.
The shorts are good, but too nu- j
, merous. The Grantland Rice Sport- j
| light i.s one of the best. —EC. l
CRAZY QUILT—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
This is the kind of a show that !
j you haven't seen since Ted Healy !
1 and Phil Baker were hero before in :
I "Night in Spain." It is a musical I
, show and about the most carefree j
! entertainment you can find.
The show girls display some !
gowns which this season's puritans •
will not wear—and incidentally, j
speaking of art exhibits, the chorus |
! has a definite part in the show.
Fanny Brice dances and sings her i
way to your funny bone and more
I than upholds her part in the three- j
star show.
j The best number in the whole '
i performance is Gomez and Winona's
interpretation of "Bolero," with Phil
Baker teasing his accordian in a
' most profitable manner. —E.E.H.

CRAZY QUILT—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
This is the kind of a show that !
j you haven't seen since Ted Healy !
1 and Phil Baker were hero before in :
I "Night in Spain." It is a musical I
, show and about the most carefree j

Fanny Brice dances and sings her i
way to your funny bone and more
I than upholds her part in the three- j

j The best number in the whole '
i performance is Gomez and Winona's
interpretation of "Bolero," with Phil
Baker teasing his accordian in a
' most profitable manner. —E.E.H.
TIIE GUARDSMAN—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne,
the two Theatre Guild stars im
ported by M.G.M., make "The
Guardsman" one of the outstanding
' pictures of the year, and one which
had a record run in New York City.
The plot is nothing. An actor, jeal
ous of his actress-wife, learns of
the lure which uniforms hold for
her and disguises himself as a
guardsman, and through a series of
incidents tests her fidelity to him.
; The denouement is thoroughly
amusing, if not surprising.
But (he thing about this picture
is the inimitable duo who play the
leading characters. They are superb.
Lunt, by virtue of his role, has the
better opportunities, but Fontanne
looks lovely, acts to perfection, and
has one of the screen's most charm
ing voices. Lunt excells at panto
mime, and the scenes in which he
is testing his wife's faithfulness are
a joy to behold. By all means see
this, if you enjoy consummate act-

! ing, sophisticated dialogue, and a i
1 gay story.
The shorts are good, but too nu- j
, merous. The Grantland Rice Sport- j
| light i.s one of the best. —EC. l
