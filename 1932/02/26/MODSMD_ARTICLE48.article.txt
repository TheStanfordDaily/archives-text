# MESH ITEM HITS PEAK
## Exemplified In Hats, Shoes, Stockings And Gloves 
### 
With the revival of femininity and
comfort women again return to
mesh. Mesh predominates for sports
wear and pervades almost every
other field of costuming. Little

white ten n i s
frocks opened
the mode, and
now we find
them from the
classro o m to
dancefloor, in
> linens and in
wool lace.

Stockings took them up and va
ried from the large lisle fishnet
weaves which wear during a whole
season for sports, to the finest of
smart weaves in blonde chiffons
which go with the pastel evening
gowns and fall to pieces in an eve
ning's wear.
Hats appear woven in small soft
meshes, sandals have woven toes,
gloves have woven gauntlets, and
even in lingerie the mesh has taken
rapidly, so that now the finest of
sports lingerie are soft knitted in
line mesh.
