# THETA DELTS IN 42-17 HOOP WIN
## Breakers, El Capitan Take Easy Contests TONIGHT'S SCHEDULE 
### 
Chinese Club vs. Encina 1E,
Pavilion, 4 o'clock
Beta Theta Pi vs. Encina 2E,
Pavilion, 5 o'clock

Chalking up the third highest win
of the season, the mural cage five
from the Theta Delt house cleaned
up the Pavilion yesterday afternoon
with the Kappa Alpha outfit in a
42-17 victory.
Both outfits were able to score
rather freely, but the advantage lay
with the Theta Delts in being able
to connect more regularly. George
Jensen in the center position con-
nected with the hoop for eight bas-
kets during the fracas.
Larry Parma and Francis O'Brien
accounted for three baskets together
as forwards for the Kappa Alpha
quintet. Defensive practice is sorely
needed by both teams.
Two forwards and the Breakers
Club center split the total tally of
18 baskets, for six each, in that out
fit's 36 -12 defeat of the Phi Delts.
El Capitan outclassed the El
Cuadro five, 28-13, with Cedric
Hyde scoring five baskets and one
free shot in the course of events for
the victors. Bob Quinn accounted
for four additional baskets.
