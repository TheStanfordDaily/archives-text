## Arresting Combinations To Charm Observer 
### Mary Lee Richmond 
(Staff of Hale Bros.)
Color has assumed a new sig
nificance this year. Every depart
ment of fashion has felt this em
phasis—from accessories through
! sports to evening gowns.
j It is logical after all. For sim
plicity is made much of this year.
Yet one should not be deceived by
! sketches of evening gowns in fash
! ion magazines. What appears to be
i a simple, severely cut gown, with-
I out detail, without ruffles, tucking,
I etc., attractive perhaps because of
| its purity of line—but coldly retic
i ent—turns out upon actual inspec
| tion in the original to be a vivid
' gown in an exciting shade you have I
| not seen before. For the color plate
this year is original. Even the old
reds and blues and greens wear a
different aspect. »
Put up against the same shade of
j last year, the difference is readily |
: apparent. The colors are clearer I
r.jw. They have at once more deli- j
' cacy and more brilliance. Yellow, '
for example, is not the old yellow j
with which you are familiar, but an
| incredibly clear, pure color, with no
I under tones of brown or beige as in !
1 the former yellows. Without being '
garish or harsh it has a quality that i
j is almost dazzling.
Originality in contrasts and com- j
binations is as interesting this sea- \
j son as the hues. Seen apart, such
! combinations would seeb to be ab- j
.surd. But together, the caoaphonous '
j effect has that arresting charm so
l coveted, whether for debutante, ma-
I tron, or college girl.
