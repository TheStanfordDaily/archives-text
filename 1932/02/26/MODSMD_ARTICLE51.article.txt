# New Formats Both Quaint And Worldly
## Cape Shoulders And Puff Sleeves Compensate Low Decolletage 
### MARY LOU JAMES Daily Windjammer 
In contrast to the slinky velvet
and much-be-rhinestoned winter
models, formal evening gowns have
gone decidedly quaint and simple
this spring. The quaintness is defi
nitely reserved, however—a far cry
from the fluff-and-ruffles era.
Gowns are still slimly molded to
the figure, from shoulder to knee,
and from there burst forth in full
flares which add grace to the move
ments of the wearer.
Paris decrees that to be truly
smart during the early spring, a
woman shall have her shoulders
covered in the evening. So we have
tiny puffed sleeves, and cape
sleeves, and sleeves of ribbon band
ing tied in perky bows. In compen
sation for this whim, backs are cut
lower than ever.
The plain or scalloped "V" decol
letage is, of course, a perennial fa
vorite and always a safe choice.
Some late winter models heralded
the newer "suspender" type, with
the back of the gown cut low and
supported by narrow shoulder
straps. A more daring style, which
promises to be very fashionable
with women whose backs are per
fectly formed and nicely tanned,
later in the summer, is a dress cut
completely away from the shoul
ders, and very low in the back, ris
ing gradually under the arms, cross
ing over in front with the narrow
ends looping around the neck, in
dog-collar fashion.
Cotton lace seems far in advance
of all other materials for evening
wear. Coming in a great number of
weights and patterns, it suggests the
crispness of organdie, whiie being I
soft enough to shape gracefully, and |
very hard to wrinkle. V
