# WHITE HOLDS FAVOR DESPITE SWING TO GAY SPRING COLORS
## 
### 
j In spite of the general swing to
| ward the gaily colored, white in gen
| eral is expected to be more popular
, with the "five hundred" than it was
j last year.
Knitted white apparel is extreme
ly important when allied with
blight colored scarfs, hankerchiefs,
! and shoes, this season.
Several clever cotton and linen
l tailored sport dresses are being of
j fered locally. Their chief advantage
being that they launder perfectly
and allow the girl with the com
plete, yet small wardrobe to be
' ready at short notice for any sort
| of informal occasion.
Even traveling coats will be white
this season. White worsteds, tweeds,
i and herring bones taking the lead,
i The white polo coat styles being
j winners.
