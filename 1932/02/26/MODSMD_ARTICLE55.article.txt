# POLO COATS LEAD MODE
## Camel's Hair Leading In Coat Materials 
### 
The Stanford rough, for all his
reputation for being poorly dressed
and possessing ill taste in regard to
clothes, does like to dress up on oc
casion, and when he does, he likes
to look well.
This is why expensive major items
such as polo coats are bought in
numbers on this campus—good
looking clothes aren't needed very
often and consequently in limited
quantity, and so the best is some
times not good enough.
Polo coats, say the fashion gods,
are never anything else but double
bx-easted, belted, and until recently
of only one color—tan. Now, how
ever, in this transition period from
winter to spring, dark blue is not
only suitable but very stylish, more
so every day.
The most expensive ones are made
of genuine camels' hair cloth, with
leather fixtures, but a great many
coats are being made out of "polo
cloth," which is nothing more than
a fairly good imitation of camel's hair
done in wool. It serves the purpose,
however, quite suitably, and the
owner of a coat of this material does
not need to go in by the back door
at the Frantic or the Mark or any
where else, nor at any hour of the
day.
Trench coats, the only pleasant
hangover from the World War, are
looking up again in the face of
Shanghai reports, and maintain their
knock-about swagger for ordinary
campus wear. A creamy-pale Irench
coat with dark rawhide fittings is
suggested for spring.
