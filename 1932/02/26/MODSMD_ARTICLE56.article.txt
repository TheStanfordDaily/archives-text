# "AWNING" FLANNELS FOR MALE ROBES
## 
### 
The tired business man, the fag- i
ged student, or even the petered-out'
prof, finds himself with a wealth of
j variety to choose from in the mat- ;
| ter of lounging robes or dressing 1
; gowns. If it be warmth he seeks—
' then botany flannels. On the other
| hand, if he anticipates the intrusion
of the fair sex, or one of his male i
| friends of exalted sartorial tastes, he
; may wish to dress more for appear- j
ance, in a silk creation, or perhaps !
| a smart corduroy. In any case, color \
j abounds, and as in other male gar- !
j ments of the more intimate cate-
I gory.
For example—shops are showing
smart stripes of the "awning" va- i
riety, made of attractive fine flan
nels.
