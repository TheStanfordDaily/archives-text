# Poli Sci Profs Are Dandies Clothes Make The Man, Not The Chemist Survey Unveils Thinkers

Engineers, journalists, are dra
! matically careless in dress.
Romanic language students are
: marked at once by their tidy cam
; pus appearance.
.Science professors are the slop
i piest-garbed.
The Poli Sci faculty is a sheaf of
! stylcplates.
This much is revealed in a recent
i pre-Easter survey of academic fash
-1 ions, in which it is proven that
Clothes Do Not Make the easy
' going and delightful roughâ€”nor the
professor to whose brain half the
| campus is kneeling.
However, all the way from the
early Jordan years through the
time of the Great Nevers to the start
of the decadent '30's, the science
, faculty has been recognized as the
; worst-dressed group on the campus.
It wasn't until recently that it be
j came clear which branch of the
j sciences could claim the faculty

| least likely to be paid to pose for:
i Vanity Fair.
But ever since last quarter, when j
| a freshman asked a question of the I
i chemistry building janitor, thinking
| he was a laboratory assistant, the
j test-tube and temperature boys
j have hit a new low in fashion re-
I pute.
The reaction of chem teacher plus i
j new clothes usually results in dou- !
bio decomposition, but amazingly
I enough, none of the "gas, liquid,
I and solid" gangs are ever seen with
1 baggy trousers. This is because
they're too busy ever to sit down.
The Poli Sci department, wilh its !
immaculate linens, golf equipment,
trim lecture suits, and good groom
ing, is easily the best-dressed on the !
campus. These dandies attribute
i their success to plenty of spare time. I
Students are for the most part ;
surprisingly unclassifiable as lo ma- j
jors by their garb aolne.
