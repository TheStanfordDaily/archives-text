# Sandals Hold Fashion Stage
## Monk Oxfords, Cut-Away Slippers Are Mode 
### 
Sandals morning—noon—and night.
This is the startling, bolshevistic,
high-handed and gleeful decree of
spring for Stanford's daintier foot
steps.
Just as one costume model of
jacket and puff-sleeve is repeated
over and over through the day in
sheer cotton at lunch-time, mesh
fabric for mid-afternoon, and finally
to lace at night, in the same way is
the one sandal interpreted in cloth
weaves for morning classes, soft
leather strappings for the city, and
jeweled thongs for night.
Formal Slippers
Formal wear demands high heel
and sole to the sandal, and not
much else except a way of catching
it deftly to the foot. Sheer hose,
sans reinforcement at the toe, let
lacquered nails glow through.
Oxfords are captivating along with
the easy sandal because of a new
unlined-ness. No cloth lining is
sewed within, and the natural inner
side of the leather is as soft as a
glove to the touch.
Monk Like Oxfords
Monk style oxfords, patterned
after those of the old Italian and
Spanish monks, with buckle on
sides, will challenge that perennial
favorite of women as well as men—
the snow-white elk or buckskin
with the plain dark saddle, or white
pig, if you prefer.
Shargrain, Cordovan, Karung
snake, Burma snake, basque mesh,
and rainbow colored ooze (a kind
of suede) will be top-liners, all
stepping aside for the Ghilly-tie
shepherd boy semi-sandal, which is
fetching in white.
