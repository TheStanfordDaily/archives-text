# 'What Not To Wear'; New Aquatic Advice
## Simplicity Is Keynote For Latest Lagunita Swim, Canoe Artists 
### Collier Connell Daily fashion editor 
j With campus aquatics filling the
whole spring horizon, and swimming
1 gear grown obsolete during last sea
son's drouth, no fashion news holds
more excitement for the Stanford
, 3500 than tips on what the campus
swimmer Need Not Wear.
For weather bureau reports indi
! cate that just beyond finals and
around the corner from spring va
cation, a high-powered sun will turn
i the boat-house roof into a veritable
market place, and make every raft
j a colony.
Simplicity Theme
"Simplicity"—is not only the key
; note for Lagunita fashion, but its
l inviolable demand. The gaudy
| swaddlings of Palm Beach and
| Cannes will be laughed out of sight.
] No oilcloth bags, floppy hats, beach
pajamas, clogs, aquatic jewelry,
j waterproof make-up, trailing robes,
| collapsible towels, tents, umbrellas,
1 nor deck chairs are to be counte
j nanced.
The Stanford rough and his Roblc
friend are going stripped and stream
lined to the breast of Lagunita, with
no equipment but two fragmentary
| bathing suits and a single desire to
| dive, swim, and get sunburned.
"Keep Wet"
i The athletic frame of mind ranks
I with the trim figure. Promenaders,
| paraders, and "sports spectators"
i look to be in for a hard year of it.
Keep thoroughly wet—this is a clear
defense against anybody's scorching
scorn.
Swim suits, horray, are brief and
briefer. The brassiere-top suits that
were such a surprise last year are
entirely out-classed by the new 1932
styles. Curt shorts, with a deft little
; skirt across the front and a couple
of tiny pleats in back for a tailored
■ fullness. Briefly adequate tops, held

in place by a single shoulder strap,
or crossed suSpendcrs. This, plus a
deep tan over three-quarters of her
body, outfits the Stanford woman.
No Uppers!
"No uppers" is the word for men,
.ill an exciting variety of shorts to
choose from. Wdl-cut, high-waisted,
snug fitting about the top; flannels,
jerseys, cotton ratine, or firm wool
ens. Especially good for this one
brief choice is the white duck short
copied from Hawaii, or the neat dark
flannel with elastic top.
There is a definite feeling this
year for white in gloves, running
through almost every kind from the
heavy leather sports glove, through
the fabrics and informal day-time
leal hers, to the white afternoon and
evening gloves.
