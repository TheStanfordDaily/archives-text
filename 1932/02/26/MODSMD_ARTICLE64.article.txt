### Virginia Lundy 
Semi-formals will play up to fem
inism this spring. Soft flowing lines,
high waists, and original and elab
orate sleeves are the most impor
tant features.
Dresses are a little longer for din
ner this year, almost reaching the
ankle, and having graceful fullness
flowing into the skirt as it descends
to the hem. The blouse portion of
the frock will be soft, often accentu
ating the lines of the figure by shir
ring or clever tucking.
The higher-than-natural waist
line will be marked by fitting and
by either very soft crushed girdle
belts or by straight narrow belts.
Sleeves are most important of all
features this season. Many frocks
which border on the formal have
long sleeves with full high puffs and
fitted on the forearm. Capelets will
hold the most conspicuous place.
They may be as original as they
please.
Fabrics are rich and soft, and
range from the most luxurious of
silks to cotton prints. Batistes in
all-over embroidery designs are new
and charming. As always, chiffons
will hold their own again this year.
