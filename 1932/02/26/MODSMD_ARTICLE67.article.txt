# Hats Tilt Over Ear
## Pastel Flowers Decorate Spring Bonnets 
### 
Tl io prime requisite of a stylish
spring hat is that it tilt far over on
the right side of the head, and ex
pose most of the left side. Other
than that, it can represent anything
from romance to extreme rakish
ness.
A decided trend toward femininity
is shown in hats of the dressier type.
Pastel flowers are taking the place
held by feathers in the Fall and
Winter fashions. Most often they
are clustered beneath the up-turning
left brim, rather flat against the
head, leaving the upper surface of
the hat still plain.
Linen New Material
Some Parisian houses are respond
ing to the plea for less expensive
materials by showing pastel linen
hats, wide-brimmed for afternoon,
with contrasting flowers of the same
material. The tiny flattering hats of
lace or molinc which are unlined,
are well adapted to theatre and
dancing wear.
Veils are once again expressing
the Spirit of Fashion. There are nar
row ones which just shadow the
eyes, for informal evening wear, and
some that flare widely from the
brims of dressy daytime hats.
Shiny Straws
For street wear, a rough and very
shiny straw is the material most
often used, although a great deal of
felt is being shown, even in the
lightest colors, for early Spring. A
few models are severely tailored,
and more of them are of the modi
fied beret type; but all of them dip
over one eye.
In the realm of sports, the little
knitted caps of the last few months
continue in favor, some of one color
only, and others combining two or
more contrasting shades. The "roll
your-own" cap is especially useful
to the college girl, if she wears a
hat at all on campus, and is being
shown with matching scarf and
sweater.
