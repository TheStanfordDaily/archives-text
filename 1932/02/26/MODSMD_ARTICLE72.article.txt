# CHEEKS TO BLOOM ALONE AS JEWELS, MAKE-UP, BANNED
## 
### 
Absence of jewelry serves to car
ry out the military motif which is
proving all-pervasive this spring.
The loveliest necks will be una
dorned, natural curling hair line
taking the place of

earnings for even
ithe most formal
wear.
Simpl ici t y of
jewel - wear sides
nicely with the in
sistence on natural
effect of face col
oring, so that this

season's girl is left just about as Na
ture fashioned her.
To overcome the stringencies of a
i not-to liberal Nature, this spring's
lady will have to thicken eyelashes,
1 coax neck-line wisps, and labor with
widows' peaks. Faces that got by
heretofore under the dash and vigor
of much make-up and costume jew
elry will have to depend for the first
time solely on an authentic peach
bloom skin.
