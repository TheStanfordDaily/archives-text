# Bell-Hop Jacket Is New Suede Novelty
## 
### 
Advance fashions in suede jackets
for women show a variety of styles
and colors, with aviator, cossack,
bell-hop, and tomboy coats leading
the innovations.
The bell-hop and tomboy arc sim
ilar in that they come to the v/aist,
button down the front, and are good
styles to wear open on warm spring
days. However, the bell-hop is col
larless while the tomboy has a smart
little collar. Aviator and cossack
jackets arc also short, and are both
collarless. They have a band at the

bottom which either buckles or
passes through rings at the side.
In general, it may be said that
zippers have given place to buttons,
and that, while the collarless mod
els are much in vogue, jackets with
small collars prove most popular
among college women.
The suede in the new jackets is
very soft and pliable. Colors range
from the ever-popular whit e,
through natural, light beige, rose
beige, jade green, a few blues, and
sun tan to brown.
