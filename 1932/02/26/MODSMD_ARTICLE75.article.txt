# GARTERS DECREED FOR EVENING WEAR
## 
### 
' | By the time Spring perverts the
1 \ young man's fancy this season the
| local rough will probably be em
blazoned with ultra-modern hues
i and styles in the suspender and
' j garter industry, according to local
! dealers.
i Although he will not necessarily
; wear the latter to classes, old man
! good taste has issued the dccree that
1 for all informal and formal evening
i wear it is imperative that the "so'ck
! hangs high."
Garters, then, will be the thing;
unless the new so-called "garterless"
socks take hold of the Farm com
munity. These are arranged with an
elastic band in the top so that the
pedal coverings automatically stay
' where they belong.
