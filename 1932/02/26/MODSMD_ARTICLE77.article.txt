For those who hold themselves the
glass of fashion and the mould of
form, the Stanford campus has
enough sartorial miscarriages to keep
the even moderately sensitive in a
state of continual uproar. Among
the many discrepancies are these
masculine:
(1) High-water trousers whose
cuffs reach just past the calf and
whose tops buckle across just un
der the breastbone.
(2) Shirts worn buttoned to the
top, without benefit of neckwear.
(3) Sweaters worn in lieu of un
derwear, which reveal, when the
wearer stretches, a broad expanse
of mid-anatomy.
(4) Colored collars worn with
white collarless shirts.

(5) Bedrom slippers worn to class.
(G) Two-bit so-eallcd collegiate
socks, bulging ominously over the
shoe-top.
(7) Silk shirts of any description.
(8) Lavender, green or black
shirts.
(9) Hats witli bright-hued leath
ers in the band.
(10) Tan shoes with blue, black or
oxford grey suits.
And these feminine:
(1) Bare legs on Quad.
(2) Most any legs anywhere.
(3) Lips that look as if the wearer
had taken a putty knife and a can
of red lead and gone to work.
(4) Tight skirts around broad hips.
(5) Slips that show below the
skirt.
(6) Loose-woven sweaters.
