### 
If you want to be really smart
j this season, include cotton in your
| wardrobe—cotton sports to cotton
I formals.
A cotton formal, madame?—Don't I
i be too incredulous. For the new cot- |
| tons are incredible deceivers. A |
! pique evening gown has a surface j
interest that rivals siik this year, 1
besides possessing the appeal al- j
ways attendant upon the daring or j
the unique.
In sports the cotton ranks before ]
| all else. Searsucker, the old standby ,
| of years ago, has been revived, and i
| in the hands of skilful designers be- j
j comes a sports frock of that crisp !
| fresh look at a premium on the i
i bright days of spring. Nothing is
I quite so clean and cool as seer
j sucker, with its liny fine color and
j white stripes, and crinkly, fascin- !
I a ting surface.
On the Quad or at the tennis j
j court, white pique sports will be the j
; proper costume. Pleating gives both :
1 seersucker and pique a distinction |
undreamed of in cottons. A novel .
; closed pleat runs up to the back
| from waist to shoulder line.
The effect is not only beautifully
j tailored, but the fit of this no longer
| humble cotton is unimpeachable.
