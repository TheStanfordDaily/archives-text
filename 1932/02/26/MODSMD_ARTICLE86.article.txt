# SHORT GLOVES GAIN EVENING POPULARITY
## 
### 
For spring the glove mode has
been reversed and the short glove
will be worn for evening while the
long glove takes its place for after- |
noon and informal wear.
For general use the four button '

kid or suede pull
-ons will be much
a seen; and will be
™ a u g m en t e d for
sports by the one
button hand sewn

Gray as a glove

color may be properly watched with I
interest and is the more likely to be
popular because of the numbers of ■
navy things which are appearing in |
the spring modes.
Capeskin is the most durable of I
the new leathers and is being used |
in the novelty gloves with the con- |
trast and buttons on flared gloves I
as well as those for sports and uses I
with result in a frequent soiling and [
cleaning of the glove.
