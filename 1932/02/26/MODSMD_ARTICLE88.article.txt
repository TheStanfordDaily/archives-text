Broad shoulders, narrow hips, i
long slender skirts, that in-at-the- 1
waist snappiness, and rows of march
ing buttons—the effect is unmistak- :
ably one of band music.

as the hours of the day, yet as single [
in impression as any squad of trim '<
lieutenants on review.
Notice hte little hats tipped for i
salute, the pyramid shape of every !
chest, the fur scarfs built like Sam
Brown belts, the severe collars, j
stripes, flashy flat bows cocked in |

J flung range of expression, yet with |
| remarkable identity of silhouette.
Dresses for street and business, f
and their companion coats, must j
; walk the chalk in military style.
Sports swaggerers adore it. Tea 1

j lot of it in the last two days), the i
| most lip-licking bit was a slick for
