# PAJAMAS PASSE AS EMPIRE NIGHTGOWNS REIGN IN BEDROOM
## 
### 
Following the general trend of j
] fashion, but. doing it in a more rapid :
! and extreme manner, nightwear
again goes feminine this spring. Pa
jamas are passe for sleeping, for the
I beach, and for formal wear.
The new nightgowns arc very ]
! fluffy, with a high waistline in the
i Empire style, some of them affect- ,
j ing high necks and little puff sleeves. '
| Instead of last year's popular shell
; pink and peach, the new colorings
! are confined almost entirely to tea- |
j rose and white; the latter especially
will be in vogue, dominating almost j
j every feature of feminine wearing,
I apparel.
In proper conformity with the new
, nightgowns the long trailing negli- |
gee again makes its appearance 110-
I tably in laces and satins, which will
!be 'accompanied by satin sandals
j very much cut out and high of heel.
| For less formal wear the robe de
chambre will be more tailored and ,
i matched with furlined, brilliantly!
j colored slippers.
