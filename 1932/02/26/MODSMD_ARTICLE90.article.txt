# WHITE SHIRTS BEST
## 
### 
Shirts will be white for the most !
i part this spring to set off grey flan -
| nel pants, black and white belts, and i
I pastel ties.
That Stanford roughs like low soft j
! attached collars was revealed by lo- j
i cal merchants when they stated that i
; practically 95 per cent of the shirts !
j sold were of this type.
An attractive color combination
j for warmer days is chartreuse green j
; with tea blue rough silk crepe.
