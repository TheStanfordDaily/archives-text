# Feminine Sweaters Gain New Triumph
## 
### Petre Hewit (Reviewer 
The feminine sweater is a schem- |
ing little climber that has managed !
in the past few years to wangle its
j way into practically every society.
Formerly the sweater was a gar- |
ment worn for strenuous exercise
apache dances, and hard labor. Now j
you see these gay garments every
where while the sun is up, golfing, ;
lunching, and even at elaborate teas,
and before supper parties.
Infinite style and color prove these !
! gossamer knits to be hitting a peak ;
j this season. Square necks, "V" 1
; shapes, graceful cowls, and low tur-
I tie necks appear. Shades are sug
! gestively appetizing—butter yellow,
strawberry and cream pink, tanger
| ine-orange, cucumber green.
I Sleeves are often very short and !

sometimes pulled above a tie,hi band
or ribbing. Some sleeves are long,
with leg-o'-mutton fullness above
the elbow, and tight slender fore
arms.
Plain colors are smart with trim
white inserts at collar and cuffs.
Stripe;; arc tricky, too, green and red
and white ones often each one a
different width just to be provoca
tive.
It is very i.ew to have your sweat
er hung at your waist with some
tightened band of knitting, tucked
in, or better, left outside. With the
way in which they are made to cut
in at th■' waist, and the way the
under-arm section is made to fit,
these are really triumphs of the
knitter's art.
