# Comfort Is Goal Of Men's Spring Modes
## Loose Fit, Pleats, Promise Greater Freedom For Sport And Quad 
### 
Complete comfort and perfect
freedom will be the keynote in
men's styles this spring. Even the
Broadway or dressy type with its
close-fitting coat, padded shoulders,
and peak lapels has been forced to
give way. The drape coat without
shoulder padding, allowing greater
freedom for the shoulder, and fea
turing the patch pocket, has become
extremely popular this season. It is
the Broadway suit which the smart
young business man will wear.
In absolute contrast to this type
is the Collegiate suit with its loose
fitting box back, notched lapel, and
its greater freedom of action. Suits
of an intermediate cast, combining
the features of the two.
Sport Innovations
In sports wear innovations are
more noticeable than in any other
line. Knickers are definitely out, al
though there will be a few who
stick by them on account of their
comfort. The latest development is
the "Slack," which can be said to
have successfully stolen the Knick
ers' stuff, and for those who have
thin shanks, it wiil be a great boon.
Slacks have all the conveniences
of the knickers, plus a business
like appearance. There are two pairs
of trousers, one for business, and a
loose-fitting pair for sports wear.
The sports trousers boast pleats
both in front and in back, while the
coal is characterized by Norfolk
pockets which have returned to
their former popularity during this
season.
Flannels Are Vogue
Light flannels with dark coat will
retain popularity. Oxford grey coats
and flannels with matching stripes
arc the latest word. To continue the
idea, a harmonizing pair of flannels
must be added to every suit in the
well-dressed student's wardrobe
this year. To the man hit finan
cially, it will present a boon, fur
nishing dress and business suits' at
the same time.
This year marks a greater free
dom of costume for the smartly
groomed man than ever before. The
general tendency is toward the free
dom of sports wear.
