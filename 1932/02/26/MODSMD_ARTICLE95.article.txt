# SPECTACLES ADOPT FULL-VIEW FRAME, SMART NEW COLORS
## 
### 
Clearer vision is the rule in spring
eyeglass modes. Adopting the trend
of the motor car toward stream
lines, temple bars are fastened high
on spectacle frames, giving a rakish
effect and letting coy glances escape
underneath. The new frames are
called full-view.
With so many people finding it
nccessary to wear glasses, designers
are striving to find the most invis
ible kind of frame possible. A pink
gold has been developed which har
monizes with the flesh tint. White
gold is popular with blondes, and
rimless glasses with the full-sight
principle are worn by old, young
and beautiful alike. A new dark
composition material, the successor
to horn, is less fragile and will be
worn by the more studious or busi
ness folk. This comes in brown and
smoky gray tints.
