That troublesome collar!
Recent developments in collar
holder research have gone back to
the old straight pin which fastened
under the lapels and held the points
in place.
First came points that buttoned
down to the shirt, but buttons fre
quently broke. Celluloid stays which
fitted into the collar from the back
were next among the bright ideas,
but they often got lost when the
shirt was at ihe wash and were
harder to find than the proverbial
collar button.
A prominent collar manufacturer
tried attaching a regular soft collar
to the shirt—but that made the shirt
too heavy. Even the John Barry
more collar with long points which
come down under the vest proved
impractical.
