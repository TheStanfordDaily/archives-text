•
The advertisements in the
Stanford Daiiy are placed there
by firms which have quality
goods to offer you.
•
They have put themselves
on record in the pages of this
newspaper. They know that
their goods will stand inspec
tion —that they will live up to
the claims made for them.
They invite your comparison.
•
Any firm which seeks your
good will through the printed
page knows that what he sells
must give satisfaction — for
even advertising cannot sell an
unworthy product twice. De
pend upon advertised products
and you will obtain quality.
