Here's an opportunity for
some Stanford Rough forever
lo endear himself to a large
portion of the "500"!
The Women's Gym Commit
tee, sponsors of the Carnival
to be presented on Friday eve
ning in the Basketball Pavilion,
is in genuine distress. They
have many decorations, props,
tables, and the like to be trans
ported to the Pavilion, and
they were fortunate enough to
be offered the use of a truck
from the Corporation Yard
But it is a "Drive-Yourself"
proposition, so the women are
stranded with a driverless ve
hicle and work to be done.
If there be any who feel
moved with a charitable spirit,
they are requested to com
municate with the Women's
Gym with all haste.
