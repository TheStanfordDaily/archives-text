corners of the earth come the cooks
who rule Stanford's kitchens. A re
cent survey shows that one-third of
them hail from south of the Mason-
Dixon Line, one-third from Cathay,

Norway, England, and eastern
United Stales.
The old California!! tradition of a
"China boy" in the back of the
house is well supported by eleven

the best one on the campus. How
women seem to mefer Chinese

| cooks, there being six houses thriv
ing on Oriental cookery.
Runner-up is the negro race. Ten
j campus ranges are ruled by colored
cooks. Meals marked by the delicacy
and finesse of Southern cooking are
i served by negroes at ten fraternities.
Sororities apparently will have none

! no colored chefs.
