# Direction And Cast Produce Brilliant Play
## "Briony" Parts Are All Interpreted Well 
### Harrison Foss 
"A fool and his hair are soon
parted," said Edward Girzi in the
role of Rene St. Gall as the play
stepped into marching stride Friday
night.
Conscientious work of one of the
best all-around casts ever assembled
during the present dramatic regime,
combined with Harold Helvenston's i
inspired direction, made Saki's |
"Mistress of Briony" (a play we •
thought practically impossible of \
good production) something to be \
remembered.
Interest Sustained
Everyone who is familiar with the
divine deficiencies of the Assembly
Hall knows that the maintaining of
intimacy throughout three hours of
fast farce was a triumph in itself.
Last Friday nights audiencc may
have had something to do with it—
even the roughs were polite.
That a play which displays so
much inspiration, imagination, and |
hard work should receive only one
showing here is deplorable. It was I
-a very difficult play to do, and it i
was done well.
Even the minor roles were done |
with brilliance and finish. Those !
who took small parts were Henry j
Cross, Louis Moore, William Reppy, j
and Hugo Druehl, anyone of whom |
could have walked off with the play |
if he had been given more time on :
the stage.
Fine Interpretations
Barbara Collins as Hortensia was
I at her best. Her part couldn't have
' been better if the play had been
written for her. Her moments of
farce, drama, and even tragedy were
! all done with a remarkable feeling
j for comedy.
Least cast for type was Catherine 1
I Musante. Stanford is fortunate in
j having an actress who can convinc- ;
| ingly interpret a role such as the
j flamboyant, dangerous Mrs. Vulpy. :
Frederick Stover celebrated his i
I debut in a campus play by present- i
j ing one of Ihe best sets he has de
; signed since "Granite." His charac
j terization involved Ihe learning of
[innumerable lines of exposition,
| which he delivered with surprising i
zest and character.
Difficult Roles
, Without benefit, of garters Ter
ence Geddis played one of the two
most difficult roles in the play—dif—
licult in that they were without
special character. Dorothy Tully
played the other. They both sur
mounted this obstacle in the roles
of Trevor Bavvel and Clare Henes- i
say with pleasing technique.
Edward Girzi fulfilled all pre
production predictions in giving one
of the merriest characterizations of .
his entire career here. His Rene i
St. Gall was great.
Kathleen Hatfield was pretty but
irritating—an accomplishment since j
her role of Sybil Bomont called for
it. Martha Slayton got her share of
laughs as Agatha, the tamed hedge.
While Joseph Lawry as Stephen,
Sparrowby reminded one faintly of ;
Paul Speegle in his method of de
livery and the manner in which the
audience responded to him.
