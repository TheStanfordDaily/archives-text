# TODAY IS LAST DAY TO PAY SECOND '32 QUAD INSTALLMENT
## 
### 
Today marks the last day for de
linquent payment of second Quad
installments without penalty. Al
though second payments on deposits
were due two weeks ago, Quad of
ficials extended payment to March
1. All payments after today will in
cur a 50-cent late payment penalty.
Payments may be made any time
this afternoon at the Quad otfirv in
the Press Building. The amount due
in each case is noted on the back
of the receipts.
Announcement has been made
that 300 less copies of the '32 edi
tion will be printed than of last
year, and as some of the sections
have already gone to press, the
amount to be printed cannot be
changed. Orders may be made at
the Quad office. Copies sell for $6.
