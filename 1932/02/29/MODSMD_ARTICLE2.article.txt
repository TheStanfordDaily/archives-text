# Kiangwan Occupied
## 
### 
SHANGHAI, Feb. 29 (Monday)â€”
Kiangwan, the focal point on the
Chapei-Woosung battle front, has at
last fallen to the Japanese, appar
ently without a struggle.
But all the Japanese occupied was
a shambles of debris and bodies. The
Chinese claimed the stench and not
the Japanese had driven them out.
They estimated 1600 deteriorating
dead lay within the shattered mud
walls.
Village Stripped
The Japanese said evacuation had
gone on two days and the town had
been stripped of everything of value,
even to cooking utensils. They said
it was a village of horror, with only
twenty living refugees remaining.
Both the Chinese and Japanese
were feverishly bringing up rein
forcements for a promised Japanese
"big push'' this week.
Jap Troops Land
Additional Japanese troops arrived
of! Woosung early today aboard
transports, according to the Pilots'
Association, but where they would
be landed was uncertain, whether
at Woosung village or at the Inter
national Settlement.
It was determined they were ex
pected to be rushed into the battle
line today, however. A column of
Chinese reinforcements to replace
front-line veterans at Chapei was
bombed from the air yesterday, the
Japanese said, and heavy casualties
were inflicted.
