Xo Stanford student, wandering far lrom the Farm,
could fail to be assailed hv liomesiekiiess upon reading a
news item in the University of Minnesota Daily concern
ing a recent meeting of the Panhellenic council ot that
college.
"(doming to no deiinite decision, delegates to the Pan
hellenic council yesterday met in special session says
the (ioplicr publication, and continues,
"In the absence of Dean Anne Dudley Blit.z, Lois Fin
der, past president of the council, declared that any legis
lation should wait until a conference either with Dean
Blitz or with President Lotus 1). Coffman could be held.
With different names inserted, this story could be taken
for ilie Stanford Daily's usual report of a meeting of Pan-
Hellenic or some other women's governing body.
"Coming to no definite decision â€”how familiar the
ring of that phrase is! "In the absence of Dean Anne Dud
ley Blitz that is another reminiscent touch. When
has any women's legislation on this campus been under
taken in the absence of a dominant dean?
It is all very homey and nice. Though more than two
thousand miles separate them, women students of Stanford
and Minnesota are evidently sisters under the skin.
