# SITTLICHKEIT

### 
"Sittliehkeit" is the name of the inbred principle which
gives a person the ability to refrain from cheating, claims
the I)ailj/ 'far Heel, student publication of the I'niversity
of North Carolina.
this (i. vm word is defined as "a custom and habit of
mind action .vhieli has become second nature and of which
one is not explicitly conscious." Those who possess "Sitl
lichkeil" are able to over-rule their instinct of self-preser
vation to follow their ideals, for the observance of which
they would rather flunk than lake that which is not right
fully theirs. Those who do not have "Silllichkeit" will
cheat unless restrained by strict supervision, states Ihe
article.
If the presence of this virtue, and Ibis alone, is neces
sary to prevent a person from cheating, then the Honor
(lode is an ejnplv phrase for nol enough students possess
"Sittliehkeit" to provide a working principle on which to
base an honor system.
Therefore, il is necessary to provide a voluntary proctor
system, under which students, lo protect themselves, rc
porl cheaters. Fear of punishment if caught and the
thought of llh> shame that would result if they were known
to cheat are substantial props to bolster up the lax ethical
code of too many students whose instinct of self-prescrva
lion is a little 100 pronounced for the good of all concerned.
