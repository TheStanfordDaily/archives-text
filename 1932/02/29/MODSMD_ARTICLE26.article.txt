MEN OF CHANCE—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
With the passing of the gangster |
craze, Hollywood seems to have
turned its attention to the race ,
track. "Men of Chance" deals with
the bosses behind the betting and
their intricate schemes of rivalry.
In spite of the suspense and thrill
of the final race, it is free from the
equine sentimentality which marked
and marred "Sporting Blood," al
though it lacks the class and cast of
that picture.
Races from Churchill Downs to 1
Tanforan give realism to the fdm,
which was further embellished with
continual band music and detailed
announcing to stir the imagination
of that portion of the great Ameri
can public which is not horse
minded.
Ricardo Cortez and Mary Astor.
in the leads, turned in satisfactory |
performances, although Miss Astor'
seems just a bit too delicate and
passive to attempt some of the
stronger emotional scenes assigned
to her. —B.M. ,

WORKING GIRLS—At the Var
sity Theatre.
I What Every "Woiking Goil"
Should Know, by one who suppos
edly knows. This is the stoxy of
| two little country girls, one not so
| innocent, who come to the big city
to make their livings and whatever
else they can pick up. And all that
the two manage to pick up seems
to be nothing but a peck of trouble.
Just as one begins to be thorough
ly sickened by the puerile inanity
of the two blondes the picture
comes through with an unexpected
and thoroughly enjoyable climax
which includes one of the best
"shotgun weddings" we have seen,
pulled off with a service revolver of
terrifying proportions.
Paul Lucas is excellent as the
learned man but hardly seems in
character when he finally falls in
love with the gold-digging member
of the blonde pair. As for Charles
"Flappers' Dream" Rogers, the less
I said the better. Stuart Erwin, as
' the innocent saxophone player, is as
likable as ever and as usual comes
out on the short end of the ladies'
favor, luckily in our opinion,
j Shorts—average. —S.C.A.

MEN OF CHANCE—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
With the passing of the gangster |
craze, Hollywood seems to have
turned its attention to the race ,
track. "Men of Chance" deals with
the bosses behind the betting and
their intricate schemes of rivalry.
In spite of the suspense and thrill
of the final race, it is free from the
equine sentimentality which marked
and marred "Sporting Blood," al
though it lacks the class and cast of
that picture.
Races from Churchill Downs to 1
Tanforan give realism to the fdm,
which was further embellished with
continual band music and detailed
announcing to stir the imagination
of that portion of the great Ameri
can public which is not horse
minded.

performances, although Miss Astor'
seems just a bit too delicate and
passive to attempt some of the
stronger emotional scenes assigned
to her. —B.M. ,

WORKING GIRLS—At the Var
sity Theatre.
I What Every "Woiking Goil"
Should Know, by one who suppos
edly knows. This is the stoxy of
| two little country girls, one not so
| innocent, who come to the big city
to make their livings and whatever
else they can pick up. And all that
the two manage to pick up seems
to be nothing but a peck of trouble.
Just as one begins to be thorough
ly sickened by the puerile inanity
of the two blondes the picture
comes through with an unexpected
and thoroughly enjoyable climax
which includes one of the best
"shotgun weddings" we have seen,
pulled off with a service revolver of
terrifying proportions.
Paul Lucas is excellent as the
learned man but hardly seems in
character when he finally falls in
love with the gold-digging member
of the blonde pair. As for Charles
"Flappers' Dream" Rogers, the less
I said the better. Stuart Erwin, as
' the innocent saxophone player, is as
likable as ever and as usual comes
out on the short end of the ladies'
favor, luckily in our opinion,
j Shorts—average. —S.C.A.
