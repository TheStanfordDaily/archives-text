And so we have with us The Fash- 1
ion Edition, and my dear just the |
duekiest little sports dresses and j
hats blah blah and stockings and j
bracelets my dear you've never seen !
the like they're just too sweet for ,

of course now the campus models
are a different thing entirely—but j
how was Mr. Roos Bros, to know? j
Fashions in sports are turning
from the five-man style to
groupings of nine, according to
special dispatches from our cor
respondents on the Sun and
Diamond. Speed and delicate
accuracy are of more fashion
importance than weight, in the
new models. The House of j
Kappa Sigma has for many sea
sons past presented more adapt
able models than any of the
other local costumers, but a
wider representation has been
favored in advance showings
this season.
A definite decline in the popu
larity of the parking ticket is indi
cated, although it is believed by its

j originators that nothing will ever
I take its place.
The Hall and Row arc pre
senting models of great interest j
in the Leap Year mode. Mar
riage is appreciated as a great
institution, and, according to
Miss J. Jamison, may in time !
replace even the Ascot tie and
I brogan fashion fancies.
i I
Registration officials are predict
ing a noticeable rise of interest in
! studying habits, about the middle j
of this next month.
Harold Helvenston et Cie. an
nounce the first showing of an
j original and exclusive Saki
model, this evening, in the As
sembly Hall. The chief designer
of the establishment is happy
over the glowing color harmo
nics of this latest creation.
It is possible that the popularity j
of Japan and China silks for spring j
costumes has passed its peak, and a j
j new line of materials may develop. :
