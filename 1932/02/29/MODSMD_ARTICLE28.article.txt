The Editor, Sir:
Lagunita isn't really dirty—it's !
alive, and the mosquito crop is very ;
promising this yeai\
One minute of casual examina- i
tion of the water in any part of !
Lagunita will show a superabun
dance of at least two kinds of larvae, '
one of the cutest tiny red variety,
and the other a lovely pale straw —
even the insect lai'vae are true to j
the colors. But they traitorously
verge on the Trojan and should
therefore be exterminated.
Consider the present price of oil.
