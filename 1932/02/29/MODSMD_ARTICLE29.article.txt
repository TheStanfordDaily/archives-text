# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE STARTS TODAY FOR BEARS
## 
### 
Spring football practice will get
under way (his afternoon at the j
University of California, to con- |
tinue for a period of five weeks, I
Coach "Bill" Ingram announced last j
week. From an informal sign-up j
taken by student managers, Ingram j
said that about 125 players, varsily, I
freshmen, and newcomers, are ex- |
pected to participate in the first I
day's workout..
Declaring that he would spend j
most of his time coaching the men
in offensive work, the Bear mentor '
revealed his plan of dividing the j
gridders into squads as soon as j
possible and staging at least two J
regular practice games a week. Ho
expressed the belief that last sea
son's training in defensive play and
other rudiments of the game make
it unnecessary to stress that work
this spring.
