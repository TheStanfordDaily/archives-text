# Practice Meet Forecasts Good Indian Track Season
## PERFORMANCE OF EASTMAN, MEIER, WERDER PLEASING Azevedo Takes 6-Lap Race From Amdahl; Naylor Runs Speedy 660 
### 
Knowledge that the track season's
opening meet was but a week away j
had an invigorating effect on Stan
fords' tracksters Friday afternoon;
so they put on the best show seen
to date on the old oval. The East
mans, Art Azevedo, Here Laborde,
George Naylon, Bill Werder, A1
Kay, and Gus Meier led the pro
cession of men who gave excellent
performances in nearly every event.
Bill Werder's leap of 23 feet 4
inches in the broad-jump was prob
ably the afternoon's most encourag- j
ing incident, cilthough the improve- i
ment of Gus Meier ranks a close I
second. In the two abbreviated bur- j
die races, Meier lied Brugman in j
the highs and did the same disre- !
speciful thing to Herbert in the j
lows.
Hurdles Bright
Meier's ascendancy was not due i
to any decadence on the part of aces j
Brugman and Herbert. The highs, j
70 yards of them, went in the good j
time of 9.1 seconds, and the 120- j
yard flight of lows was timed in j
13.2. Willi Dave Packard coming out |
for track this afternoon, the Farm j
hurdling situation seems to be pick- I
ing up.
Bill Ellington wouldn't let Ben j
Eastman break the world's 440 rec- i
oid again, as he was afraid to scare j
out the rest of the country's quar- j
ter-milers from meeting Eastman. I
So Ben satisfied himself by running !
352 yards in 36.5 seconds, which ties j
Les Hables' unofficial world's mark, I
and which also ties the world's 350- ;
yard record. What are two yards to j
Eastman or Hables?
Sam Eastman Wins
The three-lap race was won by J
Sam Eastman from Jim Ferrie and
Bob Atkinson in 3:19. Ferrie and
Atkinson tied for second a short two
yards behind Sam. Ralph Giberson
again won the 100 in 10 flat, with
Les Hables pushing him all the way
and Lombardi third.
Art Azevedo evened his record
with Ollie Amdahl when he copped |
the six-lap run in 7:20. This pair of I
two-milers proved their utter dis- |
regard for all sensible action when j
they sprinted nearly the entire last
6GO.
It seems that George Naylon has J
entirely recovered from this year's ;
layoff. Friday he ran 660 yards in j
1:23.4, defeating Fullenwider and I
.showing a strong sprint at the finish, j
Laborde, Ray Good
Here Laborde again threw the;
discus 152 feet, and A1 Ray did 47 I
feet better with the javelin. La- j
horde beat the recently injured Bob
Jones again, and Ray as usual had :
to defeat only himself. Summaries:

Eastman or Hables?
Sam Eastman Wins
The three-lap race was won by J
Sam Eastman from Jim Ferrie and
Bob Atkinson in 3:19. Ferrie and
Atkinson tied for second a short two
yards behind Sam. Ralph Giberson
again won the 100 in 10 flat, with
Les Hables pushing him all the way
and Lombardi third.
Art Azevedo evened his record
with Ollie Amdahl when he copped |
the six-lap run in 7:20. This pair of I
two-milers proved their utter dis- |
regard for all sensible action when j
they sprinted nearly the entire last
6GO.
It seems that George Naylon has J
entirely recovered from this year's ;
layoff. Friday he ran 660 yards in j
1:23.4, defeating Fullenwider and I
.showing a strong sprint at the finish, j
Laborde, Ray Good
Here Laborde again threw the;
discus 152 feet, and A1 Ray did 47 I
feet better with the javelin. La- j
horde beat the recently injured Bob
Jones again, and Ray as usual had :
to defeat only himself. Summaries:
3-lap run—Won by S. Eastman;
second, Atkinson and Ferrie tied.
Time, 3:19.
100-yard dash—"Won by Giberson;
second, L. Hables; third, Lombardi. j

man; second, L. Hables; third, Gi- I
berson. Time, 21.7.
Javelin throw—Won by Ray; sec- j
ond, Dawson; third, Dunn and
Kantzer tied. Distance, 199 feet 2 |
inches.
120-yard low hurdles—Won by !
Herbert and Meier tied; third, Gor- !
don. Time, 13.2.

Knowledge that the track season's
opening meet was but a week away j
had an invigorating effect on Stan
fords' tracksters Friday afternoon;
so they put on the best show seen
to date on the old oval. The East
mans, Art Azevedo, Here Laborde,
George Naylon, Bill Werder, A1
Kay, and Gus Meier led the pro
cession of men who gave excellent
performances in nearly every event.
Bill Werder's leap of 23 feet 4
inches in the broad-jump was prob
ably the afternoon's most encourag- j
ing incident, cilthough the improve- i
ment of Gus Meier ranks a close I
second. In the two abbreviated bur- j
die races, Meier lied Brugman in j
the highs and did the same disre- !
speciful thing to Herbert in the j
lows.
Hurdles Bright
Meier's ascendancy was not due i
to any decadence on the part of aces j
Brugman and Herbert. The highs, j
70 yards of them, went in the good j
time of 9.1 seconds, and the 120- j
yard flight of lows was timed in j
13.2. Willi Dave Packard coming out |
for track this afternoon, the Farm j
hurdling situation seems to be pick- I
ing up.
Bill Ellington wouldn't let Ben j
Eastman break the world's 440 rec- i
oid again, as he was afraid to scare j
out the rest of the country's quar- j
ter-milers from meeting Eastman. I
So Ben satisfied himself by running !
352 yards in 36.5 seconds, which ties j
Les Hables' unofficial world's mark, I
and which also ties the world's 350- ;

Knowledge that the track season's
opening meet was but a week away j
had an invigorating effect on Stan
fords' tracksters Friday afternoon;
so they put on the best show seen
to date on the old oval. The East
mans, Art Azevedo, Here Laborde,
George Naylon, Bill Werder, A1
Kay, and Gus Meier led the pro
cession of men who gave excellent
performances in nearly every event.
Bill Werder's leap of 23 feet 4
inches in the broad-jump was prob
ably the afternoon's most encourag- j
ing incident, cilthough the improve- i
ment of Gus Meier ranks a close I
second. In the two abbreviated bur- j
die races, Meier lied Brugman in j
the highs and did the same disre- !
speciful thing to Herbert in the j
lows.
Hurdles Bright
Meier's ascendancy was not due i
to any decadence on the part of aces j
Brugman and Herbert. The highs, j
70 yards of them, went in the good j
time of 9.1 seconds, and the 120- j
yard flight of lows was timed in j
13.2. Willi Dave Packard coming out |
for track this afternoon, the Farm j
hurdling situation seems to be pick- I
ing up.
Bill Ellington wouldn't let Ben j
Eastman break the world's 440 rec- i
oid again, as he was afraid to scare j
out the rest of the country's quar- j
ter-milers from meeting Eastman. I
So Ben satisfied himself by running !
352 yards in 36.5 seconds, which ties j
Les Hables' unofficial world's mark, I
and which also ties the world's 350- ;
yard record. What are two yards to j
Eastman or Hables?
Sam Eastman Wins
The three-lap race was won by J
Sam Eastman from Jim Ferrie and
Bob Atkinson in 3:19. Ferrie and
Atkinson tied for second a short two
yards behind Sam. Ralph Giberson
again won the 100 in 10 flat, with
Les Hables pushing him all the way
and Lombardi third.
Art Azevedo evened his record
with Ollie Amdahl when he copped |
the six-lap run in 7:20. This pair of I
two-milers proved their utter dis- |
regard for all sensible action when j
they sprinted nearly the entire last
6GO.
It seems that George Naylon has J
entirely recovered from this year's ;
layoff. Friday he ran 660 yards in j
1:23.4, defeating Fullenwider and I
.showing a strong sprint at the finish, j
Laborde, Ray Good
Here Laborde again threw the;
discus 152 feet, and A1 Ray did 47 I
feet better with the javelin. La- j
horde beat the recently injured Bob
Jones again, and Ray as usual had :
to defeat only himself. Summaries:
3-lap run—Won by S. Eastman;
second, Atkinson and Ferrie tied.
Time, 3:19.
