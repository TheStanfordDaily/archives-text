# Mermen Break Coast Records
## Wiget Unofficially Lowers Crabbe's 440 Mark 
### 
No less than four Pacific Coast
records were unofficially shattered,
one tied, and two California-Stan
ford freshman marks broken Friday
afternoon in the last swimming time
trials before the California meet
next Saturday.
Ted Wiget pulled the greatest
sensation of a sensational afternoon
when he bettered Buster Crabbe's
coast record in the 440-yarcl free
style by a full six seconds! Wiget's
time was 5 minutes fiat, Crabbe's
5:06 flat, and the national record
4:55 flat, held by Kojak, of Rutgers.
Hirsch Amazes
Hardly less sensational was fresh
man Dick Hirsch's 23.9 time for the
fifty. The Pacific Coast mark is 24.2,
held by Tuppy Gardner, who tied
his own record Friday. The national
record of 23.1, held by Taylor, of
Annapolis, is not far away.
Gardner entered the pool later in
the afternoon to better his own
coast record of 54.4 in the hundred
by a whole second. Finally, Captain
Frank Booth swam under Clapp's
220 coast mark of 2:17.4, negotiating
the furlong in 2:17.1.
Freshman Records
As for the California-Stanford
freshman records, Bill Rogers man
aged to clip 7.4 seconds from the
150-yard backstroke mark held by
Frank Booth, and approached the
coast record of 1:45.3. Handicapped
10 seconds, Rogers almost caught
his competitors in a burst of speed.
The other freshman mark was shat
tered by the relay team, composed
of Cook, Boothe, Triolo, and Hirsch,
which negotiated 200 yards in 1:42.4,
with the official mark standing at
1:47.2. It was in the last 50 yards of
this that' Hirsch turned in his sensa"
tional time.
