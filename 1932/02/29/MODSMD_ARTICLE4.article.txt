# ROUGH IS DOWN, THOUGH NOT OUT; VERDICT OF '500'
## 
### 
The rough may be down . . .
but he's not out. That is, until
they kick him out. Anyway,
statistical results from a local
census among members of the
500 would seem to indicate that
a decisive two-thirds of the
feminine campus still like the
old fellow.
Hp may not be the smooth
est-shaven "queener" on the
Farmâ€”he may not even be
the best-dressed man on the
field. In fact, he is anything
else but. And still they shine
up to him, for he has wim,
wigor, and witality . . . and it
has been whispered (though)
it's NOT a secret) that they
like him because he's a MAN!
Figures prove that while 65
per cent of Stanford's feminine
pulchritude prefer the rough,
a small 25 per cent like to see
what the well-dressed man will
wear; the rest just can't make
up their minds.
