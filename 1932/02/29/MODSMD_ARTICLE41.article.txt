Typical snatches of conversation r
, at ihe press table at Oakland Sat- |
! urday night:
"Who the heck made that last i
| basket?"
"I dunno, I was watching Barry |
I —he's half the show."
"Lookitimnow! They called a foul j
! on Erskine, and Sam's nertz!"
"Oh, oh! That wa sa pretty basket |
Capps made, if they don't call him I
| for steps—yes, they are. California's J
ball outside—NOW look at Barry—
do you think he'll live through it?"
"Well, Nibs over there isn't
acting like it was a Sunday
School picnic. He's squawking
about something now."
"Was that nice? Poor Sam—the
; strain must be too much for him.
| Did you see him slam his water-
I glass on the floor?"
"Say, what's the score, anyhow?"

THEY WERE more charitable
; Saturday night, Ihose 10,000 raving
j maniacs, than was the crowd which
1 saw the Trojan-Bear fracases at
Oakland several weeks ago. On
! those occasions, the invaders were
[ greeted with a chorus of booes when
1 they took the floor, and they were
' booed steadily until they left it at
the end of each game.
This time, however, a sports
manlike burst of cheering from
the California stands greeted
the Trojans, and in general, tlie
Bronz hu/zah was kept tinder
control (for the Oakland Audi
torium). Not that there was a
total lack of it—not by any
means, gentle reader, not by
any means.
A friendly gesture was made by
the California band between halves.
No more enthusiastic rendering of
"Come Join the Band" could have
been given any organization. (Yes,
they played that "Fight On" thing,
too, but somehow the expressions
j on the tooters' faces—).
WALTER MAILS, the modest
pilot of the Santa Clara Bronco
nine, cornered me down at San Jose
the other night and spoke his mind
on his favorite topic—major league
j scouts. •
"Found a couple of the Intz
i zards in the stands at Santa

Clara last year," said Walter,
"but they didn't stay long. They
got their money back, and if
they had argued much longer j
about it, there were a couple of
big football players hanging
around just itching to act as
ushers.
"Doggone it, those punks make j
me sore. They come out here and j
put big ideas in college kids' heads, i
and after that the fellows don't care j
whether they stay /in school or not. ;
You ought to know how it is—look 1
what happened to Johnson.
"You can't play baseball all your |
life, but with $5000 or so flashed j
under his nose, the average college 1
boy is likely to throw over his edu
cation. It's more money that some j
of them knew was in the world. !
But when their playing days are
over, where are they?"

MAILS PROPOSES a ruling |
which would prohibit either
major or minor league clubs
approaching college players un
til their senior year. What is
more, he intends to press the
matter on Commissioner Landis
at his first opportunity.
The value of such a ruling
hardly needs comment, (io to if,
Walter! —L.M.C.
