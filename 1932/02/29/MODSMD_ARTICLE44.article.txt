# INDIANS, CLUBMEN TIE 4-4; GLEDHILL, CHANDLER ABSENT
## Coughlin Ttakes Stratford 6-2, 11-9, In Feature; Weesner Wins 
### 
Despite the absence of Captain j
Gledhill, the varsity courts saw a j
4-4 tie between the California Ten
nis Club and the Indian net men '
Saturday afternoon. Gledhill, out of
competition with a sprained thigh i
muscle, was forced to sit the match- |
es out. Bud Chandler, consequently, j
did not make the trip South with !
his club teammates.
Joe Coughlin provided the big
battle of the day by repeating his j
win over Jerry Stratford, this time i
after a plenty tough second set, 6-2, !
11-9. When the score had climbed
point by point up to 5-5, both men \
taking their serves regularly, Strat- !
ford seemed to hit it off just right '
and took a love game ending in a
service ace.
Coughlin Fights
It looked as though the set might ;
end up 7-5 in favor of the invader, !
but Coughlin showed some brilliant
tennis in that cruicial game to make '
it 6 all. From then on fancy shots
were the rule and Coughlin was 1
unable to break through before the !
count climbed to 11-9. His score !
with the club expert two weeks j
ago was 6-4, 3-6, 9-7.
Chuck Weesner turned in the,
only other singles win of the after
noon when he barely pulled out a
victory in three sets, 10-8, 4-6, 6-4.
All the remaining singles matches
went to the visitors in straight sets.
Both doubles combinations, how
ever, came through in fine shape,
the extemporaneous Coughlin-Gor
don team winning a hard 3-6, 9-7,
6-3 contest from Stratford and
Bates, and the experienced Otis-
Ellis pair trimming Rawlins and
Dunn 6-4, 6-4.
Stars Absent
If Chandler and Gledhill had
played, the actual score would prob
ably have pointed in Stanford's fa
vor, provided the Cardinal captain
| could have repeated his win over
i Chandler. All Gledhill's efforts,
' however, would have accounted for
{naught officially, since he would
have been competing only as exhi
! bitionist.
