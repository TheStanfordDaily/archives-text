## Redshirts Show Startling Reversal In Form To Register Upset 
### 
| Overcoming an age-old jinx, the
j Card poloists finally downed the
Arizona Wildcats in a hard-lought
handicap match at Tuscon Satur
day, 10-7.
Rankling from a 12-8 defeat in
! the first game of the series on
! Thursday, the Redshirts made a
j startling comeback in winning the
| final contest. Rated as one of tho
: foremost college teams in the coun
j try, the flashy Arizona four have
j long proved the toughest opponent
| the Cardinals ever have to lace.
Aided by an eight-goal handicap
j the Indian quartet combined indi
vidual brilliancy with smooth team
| work. For the first time this year,
| the team stayed at top-notch form
â–  all through the game. Lewis and
j Fleming made an unbeatable com
: bination at the three and four posi
j tions, while Spalding and Gillham,
j at one and two, played Ihe flashiest
I game of their careers. Hard-riding
and accurate shooting on offense,
besides an almost impenetrable de
fense gave the Indians their long
hoped-for win.
