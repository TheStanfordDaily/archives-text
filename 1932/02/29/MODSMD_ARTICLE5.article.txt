# IN MIDST OF BATTLE

### 
Although an armistice is held near in war-torn Shanghai, these
Japanese marines are still barricaded in their Chapei fortifications. A
heavy artillery barrage shook the district today while down the Whang
poo river Jap troops occupied Kiangwan without resistance as Chinese
defenders were driven from their machine-gun pits by the stench of
1600 unburicd dead.
