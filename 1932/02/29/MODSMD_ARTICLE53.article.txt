### 
GENEVA, Feb. 28 (/P)â€”The "neu- I
tral twelve*' of the League of Na- j j
tions Council were busy today ! I
studying informal proposals received j
yesterday from Japan with regard to j
"some scheme for a truce at Shang- j
hai and the establishment of a
neutral zone,'' but kept their delib- !
erations secret. .
It was learned from informed
quarters the Japanese proposals |
were not likely to receive a favor- j
able response from Chinese authori- j
ties.
Tokyo's latest suggestions, as pre
sented by Naotake Sato, Japanese
representative in Geneva, were un
derstood to include the former pro
posal for retirement of the Chinese
army a certain distance from Shang
hai. What distance and what other i
conditions were included have not
vet been revealed here.
