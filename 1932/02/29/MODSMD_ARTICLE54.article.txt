Mexican Indians who control se- j
eret gold mines and punish with
death strangers who approach were j
visited by Pedro J. Lemos, Director !
of the Stanford Museum of Fine j
Arts last summer. Lemos obtained 1
some of their weavings, which are j
on display in the Art Gallery.
These Indians come out of their
mountain fastnesses only for occa- J
sional visits to the towns to buy salt, j
tobacco, and other needs, paying j
for their purchases with nuggets of |
gold.
Lemos went to one of the market j
towns and waited until one of the j
tribes, the Huicholdi, came to the j
Sunday morning market. After much j
dickering ho finally purchased some i
of their finely woven belts and '
sashes and several pocket belts, !
which are beautifully embroidered
by the brides as a wedding gift and |
are seldom parted with.
The Huicholdi Indians are short in j
stature, seldom being over five one- j
half feet tall, are quick witted, and j
bathe every day, Lemos said. Be
sides the case full of their weavings, j
many other examples of Mexican art |
and craft work are on display in the '
Art Gallery. The Gallery is open !
every day from 10 until 5 o'clock. ;
There is no admission charge.
