## Lecturer Has Made Study Of The Stanfords 
### 
Tuesday night at 7:30 o'clock in
the Little Theater George T. Clark,
Emeritus Director of the Stanford
I University Libraries, will speak on
"Leland Stanford as a Public Man."
Following a sketch of the Univer
; sity founder's boyhood, Clark will
' tell the story of Senator Stanford's
j public life, especially in connection
j with his work as a Republican leader
| in the early days of the party, and
j in view of his contributions to the
! slate's history.
Leland Stanford, according to
j Clark, participated in three great
! movements which led to California's
j leadership among Western states,
j While keeping a store in Sacramento,
| Stanford helped to organize the Re
j publican party, which was estab
i lished in .1856. A year later he was
, nominated for state treasurer, and in
! 1859 for governor, both times with
j no hope of winning the election, but
with the sole idea of keeping the
J party functioning until 1860, when
j Lincoln was to be nominated for
! president.
A split in the Democratic faction
j in 1860 placed Stanford as the Re
publican governor of California,
i During this crucial period, Clark
; says, Stanford's influence was a
I prime factor in keeping California in
| the union.
Stanford's second great contribu
! tion was his work as president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, when he
I secured the western extension of the
i trans-continental line, which, al
' though a war measure, provided the
necessary link to remind Califor-
I nians who contemplated forming a
, Pacific Republic of their part of the
; Union. The establishment of the
University in memory of his son was
Stanford's third service to California
I as a public man.
Mr. Clark, for many years library
director at Stanford, has spent sev
| eral years in preparation of his book,
j "The Stanford Family," which was
: published recently. Before coming
i to Stanford, he was a member of the
| library staffs of the University of
I California, the California State Li-
I brary, and San Francisco Public
Library.

Tuesday night at 7:30 o'clock in
the Little Theater George T. Clark,
Emeritus Director of the Stanford
I University Libraries, will speak on
"Leland Stanford as a Public Man."
Following a sketch of the Univer
; sity founder's boyhood, Clark will
' tell the story of Senator Stanford's
j public life, especially in connection
j with his work as a Republican leader
| in the early days of the party, and
j in view of his contributions to the
! slate's history.
Leland Stanford, according to
j Clark, participated in three great
! movements which led to California's
j leadership among Western states,
j While keeping a store in Sacramento,
| Stanford helped to organize the Re
j publican party, which was estab
i lished in .1856. A year later he was
, nominated for state treasurer, and in
! 1859 for governor, both times with
j no hope of winning the election, but
with the sole idea of keeping the
J party functioning until 1860, when
j Lincoln was to be nominated for
! president.
A split in the Democratic faction
j in 1860 placed Stanford as the Re
publican governor of California,
