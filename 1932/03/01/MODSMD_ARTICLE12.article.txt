NEW YORK, Feb. 29. (/P)—
Princeton boys who last year
patronized the drug stores near
their campus gave the girls
who waited on them $400 worth
of gifts.
"You have to know these
students," claims a campus
pharmacist. "Here they are,
away from home for the first
time, maybe, a little homesick
at first, and eager for recogni
tion. Wo make it a point to get
acquainted with them as soon
as they arrive."
To some people, a student is
an unaccountable young ani
mal turned loose, as odd and
unappreciative as a mule. To
this druggist the student is not
only accountable, but also com
prehensible. He is a human
being grateful for favors. He
is likely to clamor for instant
service and then hang, around
to exchange predictions on the
outcome of Saturday's game,
wasting a half hour.
