# BIG 'IF' FRONTS CINDER MEN AS SEASON OPENS
## Stanford Enters Winged 'O' Tussle With But Little Proven Material 
### Dick Strouse 
i Clad only in abbreviated while
I trousers, spiked shoes, and under
' wear tops, but armed with much
j determination and the equally po
; tent tomahawk, Stanford's "if" track
i team will open its season Saturday
I against a weak Olympic Club outfit.
! The team may be called an "if"
organization because, with the ex
| ception of Ben Eastman, Bob Jones,
! and Lcs Hables, every performer
| MAY be outstanding, and then
I again he may not.
| One of the least questionable "ifs"
I is in the shot-put, in which John
' Lyman, George Grey, Nellie Gray,
| c'.nd Here Laborde hold forth. It is
I certain that they will be good, but
' not quite so certain if they will be
i good enough to take Bob Kail of
| U.S.C. and the rest of the nation's
j best in the big meets to come.
Discus More Certain
The situation in the discus finds
| Jones a known quantity and La-
I bcrde apparently enough improved
! to warrant equal consideration. Gray
I and Grey also may be well over 150
i feet before the season is over.
! Ralph Giberson furnishes a big
! "if" because he seems to have re-
I covered all of the speed that made
J him a star in the century event in
| 1930. "If" Gibey continues to knock
j tenths of seconds off his time, he,
1 along with Les Hables, will rank
| second to few sprinters in the coun-
I try. Lombardi is another dash-man
j who may be very, very good or not
; quite so good.
Distance Is Big "If"
Nine distance men—count 'em:
j Nay lon, Ferrie, Atkinson, Sam
! Eastman, Aebersold, Azevedo, Am
j dahl, Storms, and Fullenwider—
j hold the fate of Stanford in the
longer races in their hands, or
j hither feet. Each of these is an "if"
I in himself, and together they form
j the biggest "if" on the track team,
1 for unless two or three of them
| become exceedingly proficient at
! putting one foot before the other
j for varying lengths of time, the In
-1 dians are going to lose many valu
| able points in the 890, the mile, and
; the two-mile.
Timber Toppers Improve
1 The strength of two other events
!is also very uncertain at the pres
i ent time, as no one knows just how
good Brugman, Herbert, Meier,
! Stallings, Packard, and Woolley are
1 going to become in the hurdles,
j However, recent improvement has
considerably diminished the possi
j bility of Stanford weaknesses in
| both the lows and highs.
Even the team's captain, Alvin
: Hables, has gotten into the spirit of
1 the thing and has an enigma of his
own. Hables has been and still is
hampered by illness, and "if" he is
| unable to return to his best condi
! tion, the team will have to rely
1 solely on Ben Eastman for points in
| the quarter-mile.
