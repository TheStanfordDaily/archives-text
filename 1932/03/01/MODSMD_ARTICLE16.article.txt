! Before probably the largest as- j
sembly of people, nearly one thou- ;
sand, that ever paid money to listen ;
; to a collegiate debate, Abe Mellin
kofl' and Howard Conn, Stanford j
' varsity debaters, were eulogized by j
| a governor and judged by a mayor, j
| a secretary of state, and an attorney j
j general.
Not entirely overcome by this '
! pomp and ceremony rendered them j
I at Northwest Nazarene College, j
\ Idaho, the Stanford team was both
I able to speak and to win the deci- j
sion on their contention against the j
' provision of Congress for the cen-
I tralized control of industry.
This contest marked the climax
I of a series of five intercollegiate de- j
I bates in which MellinkofT and Conn :
i participated last week. They rc
| turned to the campus yesterday, i
j saying that weather, food, and re- l
' ceptions had been fine.
Their first encounter was a radio
debate with Oregon State.
MellinkofT looked askance at this
innovation. The lack of personal j
j contact rendered him dubious of
| waxing eloquent with only a criti

cal black disc for an audience.
Stanford met Willamette on the
same topic as that used for the
Nazarene debate. Then going on to
the University of Oregon they took
the negative of the question, "Re
solved, That the present depression
is a major indictment of the capi
talist system."
This was a no-decision affair and
the Stanford men were not sorry
since ihoy found the students out
blacking .shoes on their arrival on
the campus. Later they found it was
an annual observance, Junior Shine
Day, with the proceeds going to
charity.
Next to the University of Utah,
where they again defended capital
ism, but this time it was before a
skeptical Socialist audience of un
employed.
From what he has seen Conn be
lieves that all college students are
very much the same whether at
Nazarene where most of them are
studying for the ministry, or at
Oregon, which he said excelled in
being collegiate. MellinkofT still be
lieves the "500" the best in the West
as per Hull Session.

\ Idaho, the Stanford team was both
I able to speak and to win the deci- j
sion on their contention against the j
' provision of Congress for the cen-
I tralized control of industry.
This contest marked the climax
I of a series of five intercollegiate de- j
I bates in which MellinkofT and Conn :
i participated last week. They rc
| turned to the campus yesterday, i
j saying that weather, food, and re- l
' ceptions had been fine.
Their first encounter was a radio
debate with Oregon State.
MellinkofT looked askance at this
innovation. The lack of personal j
j contact rendered him dubious of
| waxing eloquent with only a criti

cal black disc for an audience.
Stanford met Willamette on the
same topic as that used for the
Nazarene debate. Then going on to
the University of Oregon they took
the negative of the question, "Re
solved, That the present depression
is a major indictment of the capi
talist system."
This was a no-decision affair and
the Stanford men were not sorry
since ihoy found the students out
blacking .shoes on their arrival on
the campus. Later they found it was
an annual observance, Junior Shine
Day, with the proceeds going to
charity.
Next to the University of Utah,
where they again defended capital
ism, but this time it was before a
skeptical Socialist audience of un
employed.
From what he has seen Conn be
lieves that all college students are
very much the same whether at
Nazarene where most of them are
studying for the ministry, or at
Oregon, which he said excelled in
being collegiate. MellinkofT still be
lieves the "500" the best in the West
as per Hull Session.
