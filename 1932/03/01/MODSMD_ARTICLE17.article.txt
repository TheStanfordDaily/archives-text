# Russia Mobilizes 100,000; Says Jap War Inevitable Over Manchuria Invasion
## Shanghai Optimistic Over Peace Between Japs, China War-Lords 
### 
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Tuesday)
—All Shanghai was optimistic to
day about imminent peace, but it
made no difference to the men in
the lines. At 2 p.m. a wave of Chi
nese infantrymen swept across Cna
pei and by desperate fighting broke
down the Japanese defenses in a
surprise attacak.
The Japanese quickly called for
assistance from their big guns and
soon blasting shells stopped in
fantrymen.
Chinese Hold Bridge
Then the Japanese reformed and
put on a counter attack in which
they recovered most of the ground
they had lost, but the Chinese held
on to the Paitse bridge, north of
Chapci.
It was the fourth time they had
taken the bridge since the fighting
started. They armed it with ma
chine guns and appeared ready to
fight all day.
The attitude of the Japanese rep
resentative was in marked contrast
to the position Japan has taken in
the past. Hitherto Tokyo has in
sisted that Chinese withdrawal
must precede Japanese evacuation
and throughout neutral powers have
said likewise.
Must Call Armistice
Although the memorendum set
ting forth peace proposals did not
specify an immediate armistice, Sir
John Simon, British Foreign Secre
tary and one of the prime movers
for peace, declared "unless the hos
tilities in the Shanghai area are
stopped this conference will not be
held."
Minister Hugh R. Wilson of the
United States, whose negotiations
over the week-end with Sir John,
the Ministers of the other great
powers, and the representatives of
the combatant nations, assisted in
maturing the settlement plan, for
mally set forth the support of the
American Government in a letter to
Sir Eric Drummond, secretary gen
eral of the League.
