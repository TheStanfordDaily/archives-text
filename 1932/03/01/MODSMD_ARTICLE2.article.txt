# SNYDER TAKES TEN BOUTS TO CAPTURE BAY DIVISION FOILS
## 
### 
Completely outclassing his field,
Alfred Snyder won the Bay Division
novice foils championship Sunday
afternoon at the Olympic Club. Sny
der did not lose a match in either
Friday night's preliminaries or Sun
day's finals, scoring 50 touches to a
meager 22 for his opponents.
Thirteen men entered the tourna
ment, and six of them qualified for
the Division finals. Following Sny
der in the final ranking were Demp
sey of California and Zola, a trans
fer to California from U.C.L.A., who
fenced unattached. All three men
will be eligible for the Pacific Coast
finals to be held in Los Angeles in
April.
Gordon Steedman and Ed Munger,
along with Snyder, represented
Stanford in the meet. Munger and
Steedman found the competition a
bit stiff and did not qualify on Fri
day night.
Snyder's performance continued
Stanford's record of placing men in
all the individual fencing meets in
which they have been entered. Sny
der won five bouts on Friday and an
equal number on Sunday, and he
was so obviously the best fencer on
the floor that he should have a good
chance to cop the Pacific Coast
championship.
