WASHINGTON. Fob. 29. (TV) -
Orders have been issued by the
Navy Department which will place
virtually the entire United States
Navy in the Pacific Ocean.
The training squadron of the
scouting force and the special ser
vice squadron have been ordered
to proceed to the Pacific and par
ticipate for the first time in naval
maneuvers.
These orders will place 202 Amer
ican war vessels west of the Panama
Canal. The categories follow: 12
battleships, 17 cruisers, .31 subma
rines. 81 destroyers, 3 aircraft
cruisers, and 56 auxiliary vessels.
It was said at the Navy Depart
ment the movement of the two
squadrons to the Pacific will place
the largest number of fighting ves
sels in that ocean since 1919.
An official explanation by the
Navy Department of the move said
the ships would join the "Black
force in the naval maneuvers in an
attempt to resist the effort of the
"Blue" force to seize a foothold on
the Pacific Coast.
