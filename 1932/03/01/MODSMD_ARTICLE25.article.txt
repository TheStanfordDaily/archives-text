TOKYO, Feb. 29. (JP)—'The For
eign Office was informed today that
100,000 soviet Russian troops have
been massed in the vicinity of
Vladivostok in preparation for what
is considered in Russia to be an in
evitable conflict with Japan.
This information came from Japa
nese Consul Yamaguchi at Vladivo
stok, who reported troops were sta
tioned in (hat city and along the
Ussuri Railway near the border of
North Manchuria.
In a telegram to the Foreign Of
fice the Consul asserted that an
iodine factory at Olga Bay was
being converted for the manufac
ture of poison gas, and that fortifi
cations at the entrance to Vladivo
stok harbor and on Russian island
were being strengthened by heavy
guns and anti-aircraft batteries.
Supplies Brought In
Basing his report on information
which he said he received from a
reliable foreign source, M. Yama
guchi declared that there were two
army corps in the immediate vi
cinity of Vladivostok and that most
of the troops were new arrivals
from European Russia.
Munitions, foodstuffs, and mili
tary supplies of all kinds were be
ing brought in day and night, he
said, and three new forts were un
der construction at Sedanka, on
Amur Bay near Vladivostok.
The consul informed the Foreign
Office that he had been told the
Russians conslidered a Russo-Jap
anese clash to be inevitable—if not
over Manchuria then over the fish
eries question, which has been a
source of friction between the two
countries for several years.
Neither the Foreign Office nor
the War Office expressed any con
cern over the reported massing of
Russian troops. A War Office
spokesman said that for some time
it had been known that the Soviet
was concentrating its military forces
and that the action probably was
due to "unwarranted Soviet ner
vousness" regarding Japan's inten
tions in Manchuria.
The Moscow government has
agreed to allow the Chinese East
ern Railway, jointly owned by Rus
sia and China, to be used for Jap
anese troop movements into north
eastern Manchuria. This permission
was granted after Japan explained
the sole purpose of the military ex
pedition would be to put down an
uprising against the new Manchu
rian republic led by Ting Chao, a
Chinese military leader.

GENEVA. Feb. 29. (/P)—The Japa
nese and Chinese delegates to the
League of Nations council tonight
accepted a proposal for truce at
Shanghai and an international con
ference to arrange terms for a final
settlement of the conflict.
In hopeful tones both Naotake
Sato and Dr. W. Wi Yen, the Japa
nese and Chinese council delegates,
gave their support to the peace
project and promised to recommend
its immediate acceptance by their
governments.

of the troops were new arrivals
from European Russia.
Munitions, foodstuffs, and mili
tary supplies of all kinds were be
ing brought in day and night, he
said, and three new forts were un
der construction at Sedanka, on
Amur Bay near Vladivostok.
The consul informed the Foreign
Office that he had been told the
Russians conslidered a Russo-Jap
anese clash to be inevitable—if not
over Manchuria then over the fish
eries question, which has been a
source of friction between the two
countries for several years.
Neither the Foreign Office nor
the War Office expressed any con
cern over the reported massing of
Russian troops. A War Office
spokesman said that for some time
it had been known that the Soviet
was concentrating its military forces
and that the action probably was
due to "unwarranted Soviet ner
vousness" regarding Japan's inten
tions in Manchuria.
The Moscow government has
agreed to allow the Chinese East
ern Railway, jointly owned by Rus
sia and China, to be used for Jap
anese troop movements into north
eastern Manchuria. This permission
was granted after Japan explained
the sole purpose of the military ex
pedition would be to put down an
uprising against the new Manchu
rian republic led by Ting Chao, a
Chinese military leader.
