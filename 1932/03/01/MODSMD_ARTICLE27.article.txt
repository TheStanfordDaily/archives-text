# BURY THE DEAD
## 
### 
After struggling along tor sonic time under an unsuit
able system of A.W.S. elections, the women's Round Table
devised ;i new plan which was presented to and discussed
at the Women's Conference meeting yesterday afternoon.
The separate living groups will vote on the change before
next Monday, at which time the results will be reported to
the Conference.
In spite of necessitating two separate elections, the new
system is the only one proposed that will successfully elimi
nate the disadvantages of the old method of voting. It will
allow the candidate of second choice for president to run
for the vice-presidency without being automatically elimi
nated. Also women who do not want to assume the respon
sibility of being president can run for a subordinate seal
on the Council without the possibility of being elected presi
dent as occurs under the present system.
The women, realizing that their present system of bal
loting is faulty, have taken definite steps to eradicate its
disadvantages. The A.S.S.I realizing that the present sys
tem of politics is faulty, has taken no action at all to im
prove it.
Much of the difficulty and trouble in the A.S.S.I*. elec
tions would eliminated if the worthless class offices were
tossed into the discard. Their usefulness passed out of ex
istence before the illegalization of beer, but they are kept
alive by silly sentiment instilled in prep school days. It is a
shame to keep dead bodies so long unburied. The stench
is becoming unbearable.
