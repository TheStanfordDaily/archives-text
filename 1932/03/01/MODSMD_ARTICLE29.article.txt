form ol 11 1 <• Detroit Timers, who opened their spring train
ing camp on I lie* sunken diamond here before a scattering
of interested students, some of whom had probably never
previously seen how it is done in the major circuits.
I he I igers, while not exactly a championship nine, are
nevertheless watched with interest throughout the Kast.
And in watching the ball club, the Kast will necessarily
learn something of the site ot that club's spring camp.
On every news story relating the progress of the Tigers

vcrsily. C.alif." will appear. In many of them *vill be bits
about this campus, about its glimmer weather, its perfect
ball Held, and its remarkable athletic facilities.
That won't hurl Stanford any. Among other things, it
will give the average man in the Mast some idea about
where this university is located, that he may never again
believe it to he in Southern California, for example.
The Tigers are enthusiastic over this as a site for their
workout. "Mucks" Harris, their manager, said "it couldn't
