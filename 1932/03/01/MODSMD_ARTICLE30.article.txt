# BULL SESSION
## INCREASED APPRECIATION 
### 
If one adversely criticizes the
home institution, immediately the
brand of cynic and intelligentsia is
hurled at the offending individual.
Yet on the other hand, if one
praises one's own college, just as
quickly is one charged with pro
vincialism, narrow-mindedness, and
everything else that denotes and
connotes inability to see beyond
one's own fences.
Therefore, when one sits down to
compare Stanford with live other
Western colleges, the dilemma is
perfect. The difficulty of the situa
tion is further increased by the
splendid hospitality shown the de
bate team everywhere; and criticism
appears as rr.nk ingratitude.
Stanford is not a perfect place to
go to school—which may seem like
a shock to those individuals who
prate at great length about the
glories and wonders of this campus.
In friendliness of student life, other
colleges have advantages not found
here. And how some of those ad
vantages can be transplanted to the
"Farm" will be dealt with in fu
ture Bull Sessions. Then, too, in
seriousness of purpose, in ability
to worship at the shrine of scholas
tic endeavor—there are other places
which make Stanford seem like too
much of a rest home and country
club. For example, at one college,
the student body actually seemed

interested over the fact of which
fraternity and sorority won scholar
ship cups.
But a university should be more
than a library or a social organiza
tion, and in the abilit yto combine
the two elements, this college of
ours seems to have fared pretty
well. We are worldly enough to
have an opportunity to become de
cently sophisticated and yet not so
lacking in the non-worldly as to
develop into living models of the
collegiate rah-rah boy. That does
not mean that both extremes cannot
be found right here; but it does
mean that the Stanford environment
is such that the average student
should be able to walk down the
middle of the road without stubbing
his toes on either curb.
But one thing that is even more
conspicuous than the general dif
ferences between colleges is the
great similarity between certain
local types and their counterparts
on other campi. The differentiating
factor between colleges is often the
preponderance of a certain type at
that place. Some artificial creations
on this campus would be horrified
to find duplicates on other quads.
It was nice to go; it was nice to
see; and even though it does sound
agrarian and provincial, it is nice
to come back.

local types and their counterparts
on other campi. The differentiating
factor between colleges is often the
preponderance of a certain type at
that place. Some artificial creations
on this campus would be horrified
to find duplicates on other quads.
It was nice to go; it was nice to
see; and even though it does sound
agrarian and provincial, it is nice
to come back.

If one adversely criticizes the
home institution, immediately the
brand of cynic and intelligentsia is
hurled at the offending individual.
Yet on the other hand, if one
praises one's own college, just as
quickly is one charged with pro
vincialism, narrow-mindedness, and
everything else that denotes and
connotes inability to see beyond
one's own fences.
Therefore, when one sits down to
compare Stanford with live other
Western colleges, the dilemma is
perfect. The difficulty of the situa
tion is further increased by the
splendid hospitality shown the de
bate team everywhere; and criticism
appears as rr.nk ingratitude.
Stanford is not a perfect place to
go to school—which may seem like
a shock to those individuals who
prate at great length about the
glories and wonders of this campus.
In friendliness of student life, other
colleges have advantages not found
here. And how some of those ad
vantages can be transplanted to the
"Farm" will be dealt with in fu
ture Bull Sessions. Then, too, in
seriousness of purpose, in ability
to worship at the shrine of scholas
tic endeavor—there are other places
which make Stanford seem like too
much of a rest home and country
club. For example, at one college,
the student body actually seemed

interested over the fact of which
fraternity and sorority won scholar
ship cups.
But a university should be more
than a library or a social organiza
tion, and in the abilit yto combine
the two elements, this college of
ours seems to have fared pretty
well. We are worldly enough to
have an opportunity to become de
cently sophisticated and yet not so
lacking in the non-worldly as to
develop into living models of the
collegiate rah-rah boy. That does
not mean that both extremes cannot
be found right here; but it does
mean that the Stanford environment
is such that the average student
should be able to walk down the
middle of the road without stubbing
his toes on either curb.
But one thing that is even more
conspicuous than the general dif
ferences between colleges is the
great similarity between certain
local types and their counterparts
on other campi. The differentiating
factor between colleges is often the
preponderance of a certain type at
that place. Some artificial creations
on this campus would be horrified
to find duplicates on other quads.
