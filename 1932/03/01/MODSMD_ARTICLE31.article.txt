THE UNHOLY GARDEN—At the,
New Menlo Theatre.
This picture starts out in a very
mundane way—with the old cut and
dried theme of bank robbers in
France making a getaway to North
ern Africa.
We get a familiar scene or two in '
a French outpost supposedly in '
Northern Algeria—and then the J
tht-me abruptly changes—the fugi- \
tives flee to an old broken down |
mosque in the middle of the desert, 1
in Arab territory where the au- !
thorities cannot penetrate.
In this small oasis are gathered !
other fugitives from justice, one of ;
whom, an old man, had embezzled !
several million francs while in the |
capacity of a bank cashier.
Then the plot swings back to a \
haggled form. The outlaw crooks !

band together to steal from the old
man, his daughter intervenes, falls
in love with Ronald Colman, and
then, after the money has been
j stolen. Ronald gives it back to the
I daughter, sends her to Paris, with
j the proverbial admonition to find a
| good man. He and his partner make
! a getaway, and so the story ends.
As a picture not so bad —we
| laughed once during the comedy.
