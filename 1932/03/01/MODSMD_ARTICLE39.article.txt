"BUCKY" HARRIS, manager of the
Detroit Tigers, took one look at
Stanford's sunken diamond yester
day and exclaimed, "Delightful."
"That's a beautiful layout." he
added. "It's one of the best I've ever
seen."
Then he sent his crcw out to
break one of the park's cher
ished records —a fence that had I
never been vanquished hy the
best college sluggers to assault
it. It was his huge first-sacker,
Dale Alexander, who accom
plished the feat—not once, hut i
twice.
Swinging r bat as long as a wagon j
tongue—swinging it with amazing |
smoothness and ease —he sent one ]
ball over the center field fence, and j
another over the right field wall.
Yet Alexander appears actually j
awkward—EXCEPT when he waves
that wagon tongue.
"TIIEY THROW that ball around j
like it was an apple!"
That was the surprised comment j
of most spectators who saw Ernie ;
Nevers' professional gridders work J
out here in January. They handled |
the football with amazing noncha- j
lance, and made difficult plays look i
so easy those watching shook their |
heads in wonder.
The same quality was notice
able about the Tigers in prac
tice yesterday. Watching them,
you would think this baseball
thing wasn't so tough after all.
Alexander shuffles up to bat,
swings so easily one hardly expects '
Ihe ball to leave the infield, and it
sails out of the lot. Earl Whitehill, !
ace of their hurling staff, winds up !
like he was twisting a cat's tail, and j
whips the pill across the plate so ,
fast it smokes.
Such is the brand of the Big j
Time.
ALMOST UNNOTICED, the Stan- j
ford fencing team has been making |
history this season.
Already the Indians have cap- ,
tured the team saber and foils
championships of the San Fran
cisco Bay division, and are fa- i
vored to make a clean sweep of
this section by winning the cpee
title late this monlh. They will
also have a good chance to take
the state title at Los Angeles in
April.
This is the first year since 1927
that a Stanford fencing team has
won any open competition, the j
Olympic Club jinx having been too 1
much for the Indians of late.
Captain Leonard Pockman, who
took first in the open saber meet, is 1
a candidate for ihe team which will!
represent the United States in the
Olympic Games, having victories to j
his credit over such outstanding
1 oncers as John Eley of the Holly
wood Athletic Club and Ted Lorber j
ol' the Olympic Club.
FARM FANS will have an oppor- j
lunity to see the Indian foilsmen in
action Saturday afternoon, when I
they will clash with California at .'
the Pavilion in the first intercolle
giate dual meet of the season.
Something in the way of a
landslide for Stanford is ex
pected, although at least two
Californians arc expected to pro
vide sonic trouble — Captain
Andy Malazamoff and Deinpsey,
a promising sophomore.
A five-man team, the exact per- |
sonnel of which has not been se- i
lected by Coach Harry Maloney. I
will represent Stanford. Customers I
will see a long show for their
money, as round robin competition j
will produce 25 matches. —L.M.C.

"That's a beautiful layout." he
added. "It's one of the best I've ever
seen."
Then he sent his crcw out to
break one of the park's cher
ished records —a fence that had I
never been vanquished hy the
best college sluggers to assault
it. It was his huge first-sacker,
Dale Alexander, who accom
plished the feat—not once, hut i
twice.
Swinging r bat as long as a wagon j
tongue—swinging it with amazing |
smoothness and ease —he sent one ]
ball over the center field fence, and j
another over the right field wall.
Yet Alexander appears actually j
awkward—EXCEPT when he waves
that wagon tongue.
"TIIEY THROW that ball around j
like it was an apple!"
That was the surprised comment j
of most spectators who saw Ernie ;
Nevers' professional gridders work J
out here in January. They handled |
the football with amazing noncha- j
lance, and made difficult plays look i
so easy those watching shook their |
heads in wonder.
The same quality was notice
able about the Tigers in prac
tice yesterday. Watching them,
you would think this baseball
thing wasn't so tough after all.
Alexander shuffles up to bat,
swings so easily one hardly expects '
Ihe ball to leave the infield, and it
sails out of the lot. Earl Whitehill, !
ace of their hurling staff, winds up !
like he was twisting a cat's tail, and j
whips the pill across the plate so ,
fast it smokes.
Such is the brand of the Big j
Time.
ALMOST UNNOTICED, the Stan- j
ford fencing team has been making |
history this season.
Already the Indians have cap- ,
tured the team saber and foils
championships of the San Fran
cisco Bay division, and are fa- i
vored to make a clean sweep of
this section by winning the cpee
title late this monlh. They will
also have a good chance to take
the state title at Los Angeles in
April.
This is the first year since 1927
that a Stanford fencing team has
won any open competition, the j
Olympic Club jinx having been too 1
much for the Indians of late.
Captain Leonard Pockman, who
took first in the open saber meet, is 1
a candidate for ihe team which will!
represent the United States in the
Olympic Games, having victories to j
his credit over such outstanding
1 oncers as John Eley of the Holly
wood Athletic Club and Ted Lorber j
ol' the Olympic Club.
FARM FANS will have an oppor- j
lunity to see the Indian foilsmen in
action Saturday afternoon, when I
they will clash with California at .'
the Pavilion in the first intercolle
giate dual meet of the season.
Something in the way of a
landslide for Stanford is ex
pected, although at least two
Californians arc expected to pro
vide sonic trouble — Captain
Andy Malazamoff and Deinpsey,
a promising sophomore.
A five-man team, the exact per- |
sonnel of which has not been se- i
lected by Coach Harry Maloney. I
will represent Stanford. Customers I
will see a long show for their
money, as round robin competition j
will produce 25 matches. —L.M.C.
"BUCKY" HARRIS, manager of the
Detroit Tigers, took one look at
Stanford's sunken diamond yester
