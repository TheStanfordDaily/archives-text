# Detroit Tigers Begin Spring Workout On Farm
## INDIAN BALL NINE SNAG TIPS FROM BIG LEAGUE STARS Harris Puts Team Through Flashy Practice On Card Diamond 
### Bob Wade 
Quiet-mannered, efficient Stanley
| "Bucky" Harris brought his Detroit
| baseball club, 21 strong, to Palo
I Alto yesterday, dispensed with any
! official welcome that might have
! been planned, and hustled them onto
| Stanford's varsity baseball field for
| their first bonafide workout of the
: 1932 season.
j By 11:30 o'clock they were all in
j action, fielding, hitting, in "bunting
j leagues," but all hard at work get
ting ready for another determined
! bid for first-division honors. There
| was no time wasted, no one got in
j anyone else's way, but they all had
! a try at the various departments of
j the game.
Fans Thrilled
j Big Dale Alexander gave the fans
I their first real thrill when he sent
a long drive soaring over the fence
J in left-center field. The Tiger first
, sacker is one of the longest hitters
in the major leagues, and he proved
j it again when he came to hat a
I second time and sent another over
I the foul line in left field.
Charlie Gehringer, regular second
; baseman, who still is bothered by
| an attacak of poison oak contracted
I at Richardson Springs where the
1 team had been conditioning, almost
j got a ball over the right field bar
i rier, but had to be content with
L bouncing it off the boards.
The club has a lot of strength in
| the backstopping department, head
• ed by the veteran "Muddy" Ruel.
A youngster by the name of Desau
tels, who came to them from
; Toronto in the International League,
looked impressive while catching
their leading pitcher Earl Whitehill.
If his hitting can catch up to the
, "big-time" pace he should be a
valuable asset to the team.
Taking Things Easy
Roy Johnson, who came from the
Portland club in the Pacific Coast
| League, flashed some of the speed
! for which he is famous in the ma
jors. But for the most part the
i leaguers were taking things easy,
getting their batting eyes back and
pulling down flies one-handed in a
manner that had the Stanford var-.
sity players visibly, open-mouthed.
! So far no practice games have
been arranged with the Tigers, but
Farm fans may get a look at the
i prides of Detroit next week after
i the regulars go to the city for a
: series of exhibition games with the
San Francisco and Oakland teams
of the Coast League.
Complete Squad
With the arrival of the few re
' maining members of the squad to
day and tomorrow, the club will
have about 35 players working out.
The departure of the regulars will
leave more than enough for a few
] practice games with the Indians be
j fore they start South for the all -
j important two-game series with the
! Trojans and the Bruins.
The Cards will have an excellent
I opportunity to pick up pointers
| from the men who play baseball as
I a business, as well as getting a line
|on how their pitching staff can
j stand the gaff of three or four games
j in a row. And the best part of it
all is that this is exactly what the
j Indians will come up against on
| their Southern invasion. They play
! U.S.C. on Tuesday and Wednesday,
| March 22 and 23, and U.C.L.A. Fri
! day and Saturday, March 24 and 25.

Fans Thrilled
j Big Dale Alexander gave the fans
I their first real thrill when he sent
a long drive soaring over the fence
J in left-center field. The Tiger first
, sacker is one of the longest hitters
in the major leagues, and he proved
j it again when he came to hat a
I second time and sent another over
I the foul line in left field.
Charlie Gehringer, regular second
; baseman, who still is bothered by
| an attacak of poison oak contracted
I at Richardson Springs where the
1 team had been conditioning, almost
j got a ball over the right field bar
i rier, but had to be content with
L bouncing it off the boards.
The club has a lot of strength in
| the backstopping department, head
• ed by the veteran "Muddy" Ruel.
A youngster by the name of Desau
tels, who came to them from
; Toronto in the International League,
looked impressive while catching
their leading pitcher Earl Whitehill.
If his hitting can catch up to the
, "big-time" pace he should be a
valuable asset to the team.
Taking Things Easy
Roy Johnson, who came from the
Portland club in the Pacific Coast
| League, flashed some of the speed
! for which he is famous in the ma
jors. But for the most part the
i leaguers were taking things easy,
getting their batting eyes back and
pulling down flies one-handed in a
manner that had the Stanford var-.
sity players visibly, open-mouthed.
! So far no practice games have
been arranged with the Tigers, but
Farm fans may get a look at the
i prides of Detroit next week after
i the regulars go to the city for a
: series of exhibition games with the
San Francisco and Oakland teams
of the Coast League.
Complete Squad
With the arrival of the few re
' maining members of the squad to
day and tomorrow, the club will
have about 35 players working out.
The departure of the regulars will
leave more than enough for a few
] practice games with the Indians be
j fore they start South for the all -
j important two-game series with the
! Trojans and the Bruins.
The Cards will have an excellent
I opportunity to pick up pointers
| from the men who play baseball as
I a business, as well as getting a line
|on how their pitching staff can
j stand the gaff of three or four games
j in a row. And the best part of it
all is that this is exactly what the
j Indians will come up against on
| their Southern invasion. They play
! U.S.C. on Tuesday and Wednesday,
| March 22 and 23, and U.C.L.A. Fri
! day and Saturday, March 24 and 25.
