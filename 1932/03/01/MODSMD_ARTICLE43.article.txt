# SURVEY OF BROAD-JUMPERS REVEALS CHEERING LIST OF SHINING PROSPECTS
## 
### 
In his career as the Boy Wonder i
coach, Olympic Games assistant, i
track mentor, and newspaper ex- 1
pert, Dink Templeton has probably |
turned out as many good broad
jumpers as he 'has outstanding men I
in any other single event. Fred !
Zombro, Kim Dyer, Sid Meeks,
Virg Dowell, Arnie West —to men
tion just a few—were all of na- ;
tional championship calibre.
This year, a man who got third }
in the 1931 1.C.4-A. meet and an
other who has already jumped over
23 feet this season, head the list of
Indian broad-jumping experts. The .
first is Wally Butler and the second
is Bill Werder, and they should [
supply considerable strength in j
their favorite event.
Butler vs. Barber
Butler jumped 23 feet 11 inches j
last season to beat Arnie West out
of a third place in the big meet at j
Harvard. He was defeated only by |
Dick Barber of U.S.C. and Captain j
Boyle of Pennsylvania, both of j
whom broke the existing 1.C.4-A. j
record. Although Boyle has gradu- -
ated, Barber is still around and will :
be very much in evidence during \
the rapidly approaching track sea- 1

Butler also won tho broad jump
in the Big Meet last year, and did
the same thing when he was a
freshman in the Little Big Meet.
As a sophomore, Butler helped West
and Virg Dowell sweep the broad
jump against California, and he is
one man who is not too popular on
the Berkeley campus.
Werder Improves
Werder furnished one of the big
thrills of the adolescent track sea
son last Friday when he set the
excellent early season mark of 23
feet 4 inches. That incidentally is
also better than he has ever done
before, which should mean a much
improved Mr. Werder this year.
In both his sophomore and junior
years, Werder was out of competi
tion with a broken heel. Last year
he hurt his back and was never in
good shape, although he did manage
to get second in the Big Meet.
Werder Hurt Again
The valuable Arnie West was all
that prevented Werder from win
ning his event in the 1928 Little Big
Meet, for that season Bill jumped
22 feet 8 inches. Werder has already
had his share of injuries this year,

I being out of track most of last
j quarter because of a shoulder that
Ihe dislocated in trying to high
! jump. Which proves that broad
! jumpers arc after all only broad-
I jumpers.
Two stalwarts of last year's fresh
man team will furnish broad
| jumping strength in seasons to
come if not this year. They are Bill
1 Reppy, who was third in the Little
, Big Meet, and Phil Williams, who
won his numerals in the dashes.
Reppy Promising
Reppy did 21 feet 6 inches last
| year, and has come within 3 inches
of that mark to date. Williams has
1 already jumped 21 feet 7 inches
i this season, and promises consider
j able improvement in the near fu
-1 ture.
i A fellow named Don Erskine has
I for three years jumped over 22 feet
;in the intramural meet. Erskine
j may lend valuable assistance to the
I Indian cause before the season is
1 over, although he is not out for
I track regularly.
Bill Willard, a junior, is also out
| for the broad-jump and has done 21
| feet 8 inches. Bill Mearns, who is a
| hurdler by inclination, concludes
j the list of broad-jumpers.
