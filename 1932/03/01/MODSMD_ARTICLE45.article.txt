# BABE BALL TEAM TO TEST HOODOO IN SEQUOIA GAME
## Frosh Will Try To Improve Record; Prospects Look Dubious 
### 
Putting to the test the prep school
jinx that has accounted for two de
feats and one lie, the Stanford
freshman baseball players'will set
their spikes in the turf on the old
varsity field and meet the onslaught
of the Sequoia High School ball
club of Redwood City at 3:30 o'clock
this afternoon in the fifth game of
the frosh diamond series.
With two losses, one tie, and one
win as a seasonal background, and
with Fred Heringer, mainstay for
the babes on the mound, laid up for
a week in the hospital, the chances
for the frosh emerging from the
fracas with a victory are rather
questionable. Any result is possible
though, since the only game that
the baby Redskins won was with
Menlo Junior College, and in that
triumph the frosh walked away
with an 18-1 victory. The other
games were with prep school out
fits, and each ended dismally for
the babes.
In â€¢ preparation for today's game
Coach Murray Cuddebaek sent his
yearlings through a brisk practice
yesterday. The outfield remains the
weakest part in the entire outlay.
Cuddeback's supply of fielding ma
terial is ample but inexperienced.
The infield is stronger but lacking
in reserve strength.
A1 Semmelroth will evacuate his
post at third base to take Heringer's
job in the pitcher's box. The loss of
Heringer will be something new for
the team, since the big babe twirler
has started every game so far. Jack
Hosmer will retain his usual berth
behind the plate. The infield will
include Gory vMallatratt at first. Jim
Woolley on second, and Jim Kurtz
at short. "Pepper" Boyd will come
in from the held to take Semmel
roth's post on third. Charlie Em
erick, Vincent Meyer, and Pat Sy
mor.ds will comprise the outfield
display.
