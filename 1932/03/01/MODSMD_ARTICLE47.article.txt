SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 29. </P)â€”
Spring gridiron practice opened
| yesterday at the University of San
; Francisco under Head Coach Law- |
rence "Spud" Lewis and tempor- j
ary Line Coach Tom Stidham, j
"loaned" to the Dons by Northwest- j
ern for the duration of the drills.
One hundred and ten candidates i
reported on the field to Stidham
j and Lewis. The afternoon was con- j
! sumed principally in organizing the !
j squad, segregating the men accord- j
ing to positions and experience and i
in conditioning exercises.
After looking the men over and
j seeing them personally for the first |
time in grid togs, Lewis said:
"We have very fair material and j
| an abundance of it. They all have a
| good deal to learn, particularly with :
I Ihe problem facing us of installing !
i the new system. The attitude of the :
j men is splendid and deserves special :
' commendation. They are all eager j
! and enthusiastic and very willing '
|to learn, and there is, naturally, j
room for improvement. Develop- '
ment of the men as individuals and |
| improvement of weak points in I
j their individual play is a thing we 1
are anxious to accomplish. Tackling !
and blocking will be the most im- |
portant points in these drills."
