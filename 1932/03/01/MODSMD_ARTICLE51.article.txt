# SWIMMERS MEET BEARS AT ATHENS POOL ON SATURDAY
## Cards Have Less Chance To Break Records In "Slower" Pool 
### 
Hopes of a record-breaking orgy
i in .the California swimming meet
' were diminished with the an
; nouncement yesterday that (he af
-1 fair will be held in the Athens Club
! pool instead of at Stanford, the local
! pool being considered much "faster"
! than that at Oakland.
Both varsity and freshman meets
. will be fought out on the same eve
j ning, with water polo coming in
the afternoon. Stanford is conceded
an overwhelming victory in the
j swimming events, with water polo
i hanging in the balanceâ€”at least, as
| far as the varsity is concerned.
Relay Team Favored
j With much reluctance the crack
j Card relay team of Booth, Wiget,
i Gardner, and McKelvey will have
! to abandon its attempt on the na
| tional intercollegiate 400-yard mark,
j remaining content with an almost
I certain win over the Golden Bears.
Looking forward to possible records
in the 220, Captain Frank Booth and
Ted Wiget will likewise have to
bide their time until the nationals.
Frank Pilling and Geox'ge Kothe
are the Bear stars in the free-style
I events, with Rucker an outstanding
| man in the diving. Herb Marsh, In
dian hope, has been barred from the
j contest on account of scholarship,
i which leaves Bill Campbell and Bob
; Wardwell up against the California
i strength in this event.

Switzerland's first "skyscraper,"
a building 20 stories high, is near
irtg completion in Lausanne.
