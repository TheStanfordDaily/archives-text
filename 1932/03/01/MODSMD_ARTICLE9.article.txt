Kelley, welterweight.
1 The champiohships are open to j
colleges and universities of the Pa- !

will be awarded on a point basis, j
and medals will be presented to in- j
| dividual winners.
Winners Go East
The victors in these matches will
go to Pennsylvania for the National |
, Collegiate Olympic Tryouts to be
i held April 8 and 9. Four boxers will j
I qualify in each weight in the latter j
j meet and will constitute the colle- !
| giate entries to the final Olympic
: tryouts.
Last week's unexpected defeat at
' the hands of an under-rated Cali- :
I fornia boxing squad ended the sea
son for the Indian team, with the
| exception of the four men men-
I tioned. Kelley, Johnson, and Smith
won their bouts against Golden
I Bear fighters while Gilbert has been
I ineligible until now.
Johnson Favored
Johnson, fighting in the light
heavy class, did a neat job Thurs
day night in knocking out George j
Plopper. It was his third K.O. of the
j year and if his powerful right cross j
j holds up he should go far toward 1
the Olympic Games. It is doubtful j
| if there is any one on the coast who j
| can beat him.
Kelley had to go the full three
rounds to win out over Elmer Davis, j
Bear welter, by a judges' decision. ,
I He decisioned Lindsey Jewett of the I
I Aggies over the same route and
I looked good in both scraps. He
should give other welters some real
i competition.
, Smith in Shape
At the present time it does not i
'■ look as if there was any one on the !
; coast who can touch Smith in the 1
j heavyweight ranks. He looked good
over Homer Bradeis of Ihe Olympic
Club in a non-decision fight earlier
in the season and won technical
' knockouts over Ben Palamountain,
his teammate, and Gerald Easter-
I brooks of the Bears.
Gilbert has not been seen in ac
j tion since he won a decision over
] Louis Ruschin in the University
, ! Championships. However, he has
I been training hard and may go
j places at Sacramento.

, Smith in Shape
At the present time it does not i
'■ look as if there was any one on the !
; coast who can touch Smith in the 1
j heavyweight ranks. He looked good
over Homer Bradeis of Ihe Olympic
Club in a non-decision fight earlier
in the season and won technical
' knockouts over Ben Palamountain,
his teammate, and Gerald Easter-
I brooks of the Bears.
Gilbert has not been seen in ac
j tion since he won a decision over

Last week's unexpected defeat at
' the hands of an under-rated Cali- :
I fornia boxing squad ended the sea
son for the Indian team, with the
| exception of the four men men-
I tioned. Kelley, Johnson, and Smith
won their bouts against Golden
I Bear fighters while Gilbert has been
I ineligible until now.
Johnson Favored
Johnson, fighting in the light
heavy class, did a neat job Thurs
day night in knocking out George j
Plopper. It was his third K.O. of the
j year and if his powerful right cross j
j holds up he should go far toward 1
the Olympic Games. It is doubtful j
| if there is any one on the coast who j
| can beat him.
Kelley had to go the full three
rounds to win out over Elmer Davis, j
Bear welter, by a judges' decision. ,
I He decisioned Lindsey Jewett of the I
I Aggies over the same route and
I looked good in both scraps. He
should give other welters some real
i competition.
