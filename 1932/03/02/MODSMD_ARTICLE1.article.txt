Sigma Chi cinched top honors in ;
League I with u hard-earned 17-14
victory over the previously unde- j
feated Phi Kappa Psi quintet last .
night in the Pavilion. This places !
the Sigma Chi men in the final play- |
offs, where they will defend the ,
title won in last year's intramural j
basketball tourney.
Phi Psi held a slight edge in the
first half, until Jack Nourse, Sigma
Chi forward, dropped one in the !
hoop just before the whistle to tie j
the score at 8-8 when the teams left 1
the floor for the five-minute rest
period.
Nourse Stars
After a few minutes of the sec- ;
ond stanza had gone by, the count j
was tied at ten-all when Nourse I

again came through to sink a foul 1
and place the Sig Chi's in the lead. ;
Hugh Miller cut this lead short, j
however, with a nifty shot from the j
sidelines to give the Phi Psi's a 12- j
11 advantage, but this was the last |
time that they were out in front, for
Nourse and Bob Savinske came back I
fast to put Sigm.t Chi ahead, 15-12. |
In the final seconds the Phi Psi's
took innumerable wild shots at the |
basket, but the ball never hit the
mark. Just before the final whistle, |
Otto Haight put the game on ice for
Sigma Chi with a bucket from the j
foul line. j
El Toro went through an unde
l'cated season in League 111, beating
Theta Xi 39-8 in their final game
yesterday. Bob Fisher was all over
the floor and hit the basket for lif
points. Russ Klein was the high
scorer for Theta Xi with two baskets. !
Theta Delta Chi turned the tables
on El Capitan, beating the former j
League V leaders 18-10. El Capi- j
tan's defeat leaves Theta Chi as !
the only unbeaten team in this j
league.

two wins by coming back in the
second half to take the Sequoia II j
