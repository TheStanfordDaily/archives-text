### Maurice Rapf 
Sigma Chi cinched top honors in ;
League I with u hard-earned 17-14
victory over the previously unde- j
feated Phi Kappa Psi quintet last .
night in the Pavilion. This places !
the Sigma Chi men in the final play- |
offs, where they will defend the ,
title won in last year's intramural j
basketball tourney.
Phi Psi held a slight edge in the
first half, until Jack Nourse, Sigma
Chi forward, dropped one in the !
hoop just before the whistle to tie j
the score at 8-8 when the teams left 1
the floor for the five-minute rest
period.
Nourse Stars
After a few minutes of the sec- ;
ond stanza had gone by, the count j
was tied at ten-all when Nourse I

again came through to sink a foul
and place the Sig Chi's in the lead.
Hugh Miller cut this lead short,
however, with a nifty shot from the
sidelines to give the Phi Psi's a 12-
11 advantage, but this was the last
time that they were out in front, for
Nourse and Bob Savinske came back
fast to put Sigma Chi ahead, 15-12.
In the final seconds the Phi Psi's
took innumerable wild shots at the
basket, but the ball never hit the
mark. Just before the final whistle,
Otto Haight put the game on ice for
Sigma Chi with a bucket from the
foul line.
El Toro went through an unde
feated season in League III, beating
Theta Xi 39-8 in their final game
yesterday. Bob Fisher was all over
the floor and hit the basket for 19
points. Russ Klein was the high
scorer for Theta Xi with two baskets.
Theta Delta Chi turned the tables
on El Capitan, beating the former
League V leaders 18-10. El Capi-
tan's defeat leaves Theta Chi as
the only unbeaten team in this
league.
Encina 1E Wins
Encina 1E boosted their record to
two wins by coming back in the
second half to take the Sequoia II
five, 22-18. With Dick Morrison and
Don Bacon scoring regularly, the
frosh made ten points in the last
period to erase Sequoia's 14-12 half
time lead. Winston Strong made 12
of the loser's 18 points.
With Johnny Valentine making
seven baskets, Los Arcos scored an
easy 26-11 victory over Phi Kappa
Sigma. The Wardwell brothers, Bob
and Ralph, contributed some seven
digits to the Phi Sig cause.
Delta Upsilon had too much on the
ball for the Alpha Sigma Phi outfit
and came through with a 19-7 win.
Howie Folsom made six points for
the winners, while Bob Baxter reg
istered the same total for Alpha
Sigma Phi.
Gene Mires, Ed Woodworth, Bus-
