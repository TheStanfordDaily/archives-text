Suspects Seen
The first news of the kidnapping
| was secured by the Associated
| Press, when an Associated Press
l correspondent ran a mile over
| muddy, rutted roads to phone his
i story into the New York office.
! These same mired roads delayed
I police from reaching the Lindbergh
1 home for an hour after they learned
1 of the baby's disappearance.
Two men, driving a dark green
! Chrysler sedan, are reported to have
j been seen in the vicinity of the
j house early in the evening, asking

i the Flying Colonel. The car was
J later found to be registered to an

it was stolen the day before.
Clues Scanty
The baby, probably the best
| known infan* in America, was put
j to bed at his usual hour, 7:30, in the
j nursery. At 10 o'clock, someone
| looked into the bedroom. The crib
j was empty. And that's all the in
| formation the family would give to
| police.

! searched the house from attic to
eel la r, seeking for clues. Mrs. Lind
bergh, said to be expecting another
