# 1932 Quad Limits Number Of Copies
## 
### 
In view of the fact that 300 less
copies of this year's Quad will be
printed than of the 1931 edition,
Quad salesmen will be stationed all
day today on the English and Engi
neering corners in order to wind up
sales for the year as soon as pos
sible.
As several of the sections of the
Quad have already gone to press,
the number of copies to be printed
cannot be enlarged. Copies sell at
$6 each.
Second payments on Quad install
ments now due and payable may be
made to the salesmen at the Engi
neering corner. Colored aerial views
of the campus will also be on sale
at 10c each.
