# ARBUTHNOT LEERS, LAUGHS AT COVER
## 
### 
The- Old Boy of Chappie is going
to cover himself with so much glory
in his next issue, that he'll have to
send his suit to the cleaners.
With the aid of that Eminent
Fish, Churchill, plus versed by
Caroling Cameron, the Ancient One
smirks smugly at the success of ihe
effervescent epidermis of his Amer
ican Weakly Issue. Lurking back of
the cover is 11. Ashcan Woof of the
Freak Defective Police busily iden
tifying bath towels, and .just behind
him Science asks: "Are Apes
Smarter Than Econ Studes?"
"Listen, lady, I suppose yun don't
know who Arbuthnot is? Or 'Who
Kidnapped the- Pretty Waitress?'
or 'Who Strangled Beautiful Bobo?'
"Yuh. see, lady, 'Everybody
Laughed but Arbuthnot,' and why?
Well, 'Why Were the Sunday Tour
ists Griped?' Yuh want to know, eh?
Buy tomorrow's Chappie and get
wise to yourself, yuh simple idiot!'"
