# 2-DAY RUN ENDS KING'S ROMANCE
## 
### 
Disappointing insofar as voice re
production and action were con
cerned, but partly compensated by
the excellent scenery, "The King's
Romance," production of the Thea
tre Mechanique, ended its two-day
run yesterday afternoon in the Lit
tle Theatre.
The entira responsibility of pro
duction and technical work lias been
in the hands of Ellsworth Martin.
By the manipulation of light and
perspective painting, an illusion of
illimitable depth was given, thus
transforming the miniature stage
into a sea cove or cathedral, as the
scene demanded. In this way, little
imagination had to be used, al
though this experimental theatre is
dedicated to that particular phe
nomenon.
'"The King's Romance" is a music
drama adapted from "The Coming
of Arthur." from Tennyson's "Idylls
of the King." The figures were
drawn across the small stage by a
system of belts, and were naturally
stiff, as well as being unconvincing.
The faces were barely discernable,
and parts of scenery often ob
structed whatever action was taking
place on the platform. A very effec
tive sunrise was achieved in Scene
1 of Act I, as well as a realistic
sunrise in Vision 4 of Act 11.
