r ENEVA, March I. (/Pi —Japan formally notified the League of Nations
council tonight she accepted the League's proposal for an international
conference at Shanghai to terminate the Sino-Japanesc conflict there.
A Chinese spokesman informed the Associated Press his government
had accepted a peace proposal submitted by representatives of the Great
Powers at preliminary negotiations already held at Shanghai. But while
the fighting continues, the spokesman said. China's representatives in
Geneva will withhold formal acceptance of the council's peace plan.

' The council's proposal calls for a
1 conference of the Great Powers and
representatives of China and Japan
at Shanghai. The United States has
indicated its willingness to partici
pate in this conference.
SHANGHAI, March 2. (/P)—New
Japanese troops, approximately 10,-
000 men, were reported today to be
fighting their way southward from
around Liuho, where they landed
yesterday. Authenticated reports
said the newcomers managed to get
ashore, landing on the south bank
of the Yangtze river.
They were thought to be advanc
ing southeastward toward Shang
hai, with the object of joining the
right flank of the Japanese lines
north of Kiangwan.
A battle of heavy ordnance over
the flaming ground of Chapei jarred
everything within miles today as
Japanese and Chinese guns ham
mered each other's positions. Cha
pei was a blazing inferno from the
worst punishment thus far. Along
the Kiangwan front action also was
resumed, although to a lesser de
gree.
The Japanese headquarters an
nounced that during yesterday's ac
tion the whole line between Kiang
wan and Miaochungchen, a distance
of about two miles, had been ad
vanced from three-fourths of a mile
to a mile.
Launch New Drive
These new positions were con
solidated during the night and long
before daybreak the Japanese storm
troops went over the top to con
tinue the forward movement.
The Japanese apparently were
carrying out their original plan to
break through at Kiangwan and
then drive southward toward the
Chinese strongholds jn Chapei,
i about two miles away. If they ad
vance far enough the attack on
Chapei probably will be carried out
in conjunction with an assault from
the Japanese lines to the east of
Hongkew.
Fire Silences Guns
The fire seemed to be most in
- tense in the area around the North
! Railway station, which has been
i battered into wreckage by the Japa
nese guns. For the moment both
: the Chinese and Japanese batteries
were silent.
Japanese headquarters announced
that advancing infantrymen found
more than 200 Chinese dead at a
cross roads which had been under
heavy fire for several days. More
than 700 wounded Chinese were
brought back from the front to the
' crowded hospitals of the Interna
i tional settlement.
