# FUN AND FROLIC IN ROUMANIA
## 
### 
The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la, may have
had nothing to do with the case as far as Gilbert and Sllll i
van were concerned, but King Carol 1 of Roiunania does
not appear to agree with the merry Englishmen. Setting
out to reestablish himself in the good graces of his former
queen, Helen, the comic opera ruler of the Balkans' most
publicized kingdom is making use of barrages of orchids
to ( i.'iterate the memory of his past shortcomings.
Rather a novel idea that, orchids not usually being tiling
around in quantities sullicient to justify the term "bar
rages," but it is quite in keeping with the farcical character
of the Roumanian royal family's ordinary antics. Not the
least amusing of these capers is this latest one whereby,
after doing everything possible to annul their marriage
and drive Helen out of the country, Carol is now executing
a right about face and wants to bring bis much-abused
consort back.
Recollections of Carol's Parisian escapades, Dowager
Queen Marie's tour of the I'nited States, and the recent
marital excitement over the affair of Prince Nicholas with
a commoner, combine to make denizens of a more sober
nation wonder if the light opera writers of the Gay Nineties
were not cribbing from future events. Flowers in barrages,
music by the royal band, romance and intrigue by royal
family, what more could a librettist or composer ask?
However, the chief character is not the type of hero that
youthful training has caused most of us to demand. He
savors too much of the wolf in sheep's clothing, very ragged
sheepskin, too. II Helen is smart she will take cover against
the orchid bombardment and give Carol the cold shoulder.
He won't do right by our Nell.
