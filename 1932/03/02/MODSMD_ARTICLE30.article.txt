# HOW MANY GET THE TYPE THEY WANT?

### 
If anyone doubts that mate-choosing is one of the major
problems of the average university student, let him peruse
the pages of college newspapers from every section of the
I'nited States.
One out of every three he picks up, whether from north,
south, east, or west, will carry tlie results.of a question
naire among the students revealing the type of woman or
man the men or women would choose as wives or hus
bands.
The women of Yassar want men who are athletic, intel
ligent, smooth dancers, witty in conversation, handsome of
face, and at least semi-wealthy. Men at Columbia I'niver
silv prefer smart, intelligent women, regardless of beauty
in face or (igure (the hypocrites). Barnard College co-eds
favor moneyed men who have culture, good looks, and a
sense of humor. Their second choice calls for a man who
is au accomplished conversationalist, not particularly
handsome, 1 :il home with his thoughts and books! These
are typical; we could go on indefinitely with college after
college.
The Farm would be seventh heaven for Columbia men.
It would be hell for the women whose views we have ex
posed. That is, of course, if any of this sort of hokum
meant anything.
