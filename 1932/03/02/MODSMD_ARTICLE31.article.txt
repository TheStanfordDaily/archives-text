### 
The popular opinion that the group known ;is the "Brief
Case Brigade," whose members are noted for their high
water pants, long hair and the reputation for never pulling
their respective noses out of text book except for a light
snack or a couple of hours' rest, has it all over those college
students who take an active interest in campus life in the
mal'er of grades has been exploded by a survey made by
the College of the City of New York.
The data gathered shows that students who participate
in the greatest number of activities receive the highest
scholastic grades. II was shown also that participation in
student activities is accompanied by higher average intel
ligence.
Conic out of your holes, grinds. Your continual pound
ing of the books, like whistling, may only brand you as a
moron.
