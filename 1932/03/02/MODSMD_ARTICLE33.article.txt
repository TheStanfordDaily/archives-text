# BULL SESSION
## THE 						HAPPY WARRIOR 
### 
Anyone who heard Franklin i
Roosevelt nominate Alfred Eman
uel Smith in 1928 would have
thought that nothing could ever
have separated the two men. When
the present Governor of New York i
hobbled to the rostrum and then J
I proceeded to give one of the most
I stirring speeches of either conven
j tion, extolling and glorifying the
i "Happy Warrior," few could have
foreseen the present situation. Of
course, just exactly what the pres
ent situation is finds most of the
I know-boys guessing.
A year ago it looked as if Roose
i velt would make the Democratic
j convention next year a Roosevelt- j
! for-President rally. Now it looks as I
I if the 1932 meeting will be a typical
! Bourbon free-for-all with the cus
i tomary result that the big men
j knock each other out giving the
J prize to some little fellow who sat !
j over in the corner away from the
; fight and stepped into the spotlight
when no other candidate had the !
| power even to hold his own hand
; up and declare himself the winner, i
This sad state of affairs—sad for
I the Roosevelt men —is due to two '
causes, namely: Roosevelt and
Smith. Roosevelt because he could i
not hold the impetuous Democrats
from becoming exuberant at the
real possibility of victory—and as a i
result his bubble reached the sky
and, like his dreams, that bubble is j
fast bursting. Smith has been one i

iof the factors in bursting that
babble. If he had rushed behind his
former friend, the Roosevelt bubble
might have become a .steam roller.
If he had withdrawn to the Empire
I State building, the bubble might
j have zoomed upward practically
unobstructed. But now?

The Smith candidacy, and there
seems little to indicate that Smith
is not a candidate, will cut into
Roosevelt strength and with other
candidates grabbing oil dry South
i ern votes, the Democratic cousin of
j the late Teddy is very apt to be
j crucified on the rocks of distribu
tion. Further, Smith could have
| averted the dog and cat fight that
I is giving Republican politicians in
' creased hope. Bourbon chances with
; any candidate are severely ham
j pered with internal dissension.
Of course, even though the Presi-
I dency is a killing job, any man will
i take a chance at it. The glory of it
! all will blind any man, especially
i Smith, who thinks he has a chance
I —who polled more votes than any
: other Democrat in history. But
i Smith should realize that depression
lor no depression Hoover can beat
i him just as he beat him in 1928.
j Roosevelt is different—he can draw
the wet votes without offending so
i many drys; he is polished and cul
; tured; he has no politically damag-
I ing religious affiliations and he, too,
j can carry New York state.
