THE HOUSE OF CONNELLY And
Other Plays—By Paul Green.
New York: Samuel French. 1931.
(A( the Palo Alto liook Shop.)
Although it is "The House of
Connelly" which has made such a
hit in New York, the "other plays,"
"Potters' Field" and "Tread the
Green Grass," evince superior
craftsmanship and greater original
ity. All three are meritorious and
thoroughly focus the attention but
we wonder if Paul Green is not,
perhaps, just a versatile imitator.
In "The House of Connelly" we
see the dismal collapse of the tradi
tions of a fine, but worn-out, South
ern family. This is comparable to
the work of George W. Cable.
"Potters' Field," the best of the
three, is after the manner of Eugene
O'Neill. This "symphonic" drama,
with a dilapidated negro settlement
for a background, reveals an in
sight into the trusting, fatalistic
darky nature. /
And lastly, "Tread the Green
Grass" is not so hot—feeble, Edna
St. Vincent Mi 11 ay in prose.

A MAN CANNOT BEAT A LADY J
At the Great China Theatre, San
Francisco.
Above a boiler-factory din made |
by the crashing cymbals, a plaintive ,
squeak similar to the shrill squeak j
i of a bagpipe or the unoiled hinges |
of a barnyard gate tickled the ears !
j of the devotees of Thespis viewing'
a Chinese theatrical production. It
' was the orchestra.
Since the Chinese audience had
i not arrived, the manager, D. S. j
Fong, explained the drama to ye j
; Daily scribe. It seems that the pc- ;
| tite leading lady, Yung Ying Hai, I
| bad written the play concerning tho
unfortunate plight of a high-born
j oriental woman whose brother had
committed suicide and whose son,
called to assume his position as a
; Chinese general, appeared on the
j scene drunk. The dizzy pantomime
J of tho youth revealed his drunken
| iiess even to occidental eyes.
) But acting honors go to a noncha- |
| U.nt stage-hand who changed props
\ and scenes oblivious to the tense !
• drama being played about him.
