The Editor, Sir:
I am taking this means of letting
you and the general public know of
the organization of a new society.
Until some three days or so 1
and probably you didn't realize the
need of this society, but the posi
tively brilliant Mr. Abe Mellinkoff
has made this need readily appar
ent—and here let me take the op
portunity of praising the said Abe—
It is but rarely that a university
has a man of his calibre—a par
ticular phase of the meat business
usually claims his type before "it"
reaches college—however, let it suf
fice to say that Stanford ought to
be honored—indeed more than hon
ored. How many other institutions
have such a boy genius, a veritable
prodigy that can in one brief article
dispose of the Hoover Administra
tion and in another accurately and
in a coldly impartial and intellec
tual way make the 18th Amend
ment and all the questions relating
to it so absuidly simple of solution
that one wonders why so much time
is wasted on it?
You see, I am carried away by
the wonderful Abe—but to get back
to the new society—lts name is to
be "The Club for the Extermina
tion of the Phi Bete." It all started
from the honorable Abe's article on
that subject. The fame of Mr. Mol
loncough has spread far and wide
—it is even said that his reading
public can be compared only to that
of Bud Fisher's. There is an epi
demic of like organizations spring
ing up everywhere. They—just as
I and my confreres never realized
how utterly useless Phi Beta Kappa
really was. It may seem odd that
this wasn't realized before, but
when one coolly considers it, it is
not at all odd. The reason is Society
just hadn't produced a high enough
individual to see through it—there
was but one Plato, but one New

ton, but one Columbus, so is there
but one Meloncolyoff. The whole
matter had to remain unsolved till
Necklinoff came along and put his
i keen mind to it.
It just occurs to me as I write —
' Gentlemen—let us make Mr. Abble
; pated Neckinougli our next Presi
dent of the United States.
I fear I have wandered far from
; my original intention of merely

mentioning the creation of our so
ciety—but I ask you—what mortal
wouldn t wander, wouldn't even
raise his voice in paeans of praise
il something he was writing about
ccjnccrned even in a trifling way
"our admirable Abe."
Yours truly.

The Editor, Sir:
I am taking this means of letting
you and the general public know of
the organization of a new society.
Until some three days or so 1
and probably you didn't realize the
need of this society, but the posi
tively brilliant Mr. Abe Mellinkoff
has made this need readily appar
ent—and here let me take the op
portunity of praising the said Abe—
It is but rarely that a university
has a man of his calibre—a par
ticular phase of the meat business
usually claims his type before "it"
reaches college—however, let it suf
fice to say that Stanford ought to
be honored—indeed more than hon
ored. How many other institutions
have such a boy genius, a veritable
prodigy that can in one brief article
dispose of the Hoover Administra
tion and in another accurately and
in a coldly impartial and intellec
tual way make the 18th Amend
ment and all the questions relating
to it so absuidly simple of solution
that one wonders why so much time
is wasted on it?
You see, I am carried away by
the wonderful Abe—but to get back
to the new society—lts name is to
be "The Club for the Extermina
tion of the Phi Bete." It all started
from the honorable Abe's article on
that subject. The fame of Mr. Mol
loncough has spread far and wide
—it is even said that his reading
public can be compared only to that
of Bud Fisher's. There is an epi
demic of like organizations spring
ing up everywhere. They—just as
I and my confreres never realized
how utterly useless Phi Beta Kappa
really was. It may seem odd that
this wasn't realized before, but
when one coolly considers it, it is
not at all odd. The reason is Society
just hadn't produced a high enough
individual to see through it—there
was but one Plato, but one New

ton, but one Columbus, so is there
but one Meloncolyoff. The whole
matter had to remain unsolved till
Necklinoff came along and put his
i keen mind to it.
It just occurs to me as I write —
