The Detroit Tigers are visually j
clashed as a second division club, !
when the boys get together and be- !
gin hashing over the national pas- |
time. Two 01 three years ago they |
had all sorts of hitting power and j
very weak pitching. Now, according ,
to one of their coaches, they have i
possibilities of a fine pitching staff, j
but are in narrow straits for some j
hitting power.
The way Alexander and Gehr- j
inger have been dwarfing the Stan- j
ford ball park's fences would belie j
this to the casual observer. But j
when the team as a whole is con
sidered they COULD use a couple J
of dependable sluggers.
One of the likeliest looking
rookies training with the Tigers
is a youngster named Frit/, who !
came from the Beaumont club.
Although Alexander failed to
put one over the barriers while
we were out there today, Fritz, ,
who hats left-handed, gave the
right field fence its baptismal
lire when he drove a ball al- '
most into the freshman field.
Manager Harris admitted that
"he has been hitting the ball
fairly hard," nodding an ap
proving smile in Fritz's direc
tion.
Bright and early Monday morn- j
ing we tore down to the field with !
an utter disregard of classes to I
watch our boyhood idols, a big
league ball club, work out.
The first Tiger uniform that we
encountered turned out to contain j
an agreeable, elderly gentleman j
whom we took for one of the !
coaches. He chatted of four years I
spent in playing baseball for the j
University of Michigan under the I
great Willie Heston, Sr., of alumni j
games against teams with such )
baseball stars-to-be as George Sis- |
ler and Branch Rickey, and finally i
of his spending the first week or two j
of each spring training season with j
the Tigers. j
Later, Neal Conway, their
park superintendent, explained
that the uniform had contained
Gerald "Jerry" Utley, one of j
Detroit's most prominent build
ing contractors. Utley hasn't j
missed the opening week of
practice with the Tigers for the j
last 12 years. He is a bachelor,
and, according to Conway, who
is bis particular pal, is in as
near physical trim the year j
round as is possible. His week
with the Tigers is his annual
vacation.

If the Tigers keep on at their j
present rate, they will be a squad
of graduates from the Toronto club j
in the International League. At the j
present time they can assemble an j
entire infield of experienced "grad- I
uates": Alexander, first; Gehringer, j
second; Rogell, shortstop; Richard- !
son, third; and Hay worth, catcher, j
Toronto usually gives Rochester
a good fight for the flag, and if the
club keeps sending up Tigers like
those already in the majors, Detroit
ought to break into the first divi- \
sion pretty soon. â€”Bob Wade
