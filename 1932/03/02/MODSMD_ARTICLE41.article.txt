# Babe Cindermen After J. C. Revenge Saturday
## FROSH HURDLERS BOLSTER SAGGING POWER ON TRACK Munro Is Gunning For New Little Big Meet Record In Low Timbers 
### Day Dorland 
Strong in the cinder events, but
j still a bit wobbly in the field com
i petition, Bill Ellington's freshman
' oval stars will seek revenge on
Sacramento Junior College Satur
day morning for the defeat suffered
| last year from the combined forces
' of the J.C. and Sacramento High's
i championship prep squad.
After being nosed out in their
! first meet of the year with tho All-
Stars last Saturday, the babes have
begun to show unexpected strength
i that may be developed in time to
| send the capital city trackmen home
1 in mourning. The hurdles have been
i polished up with the performance
; of Frankie Bowles.
Strong Timber Toppers
j Approximately a foot shorter
i than an orthodox hurdler should be,
I Bowles is stepping over the high
; timbers in 16.7, and promises to
' snip a few more tenths from this
j mark.
j To fill out the picture, Torn Sales,
captain, Andy Bright, low-stick
I champ of the Peninsula League,
; and Robert Buffum are all stretch
; ing over the highs in good style,
i The low barrier event is well
| taken care of by Russ Monro, who
| has knocked off 24.2, and is gunning
| for the Little Big Meet record this
| year. Bright and Buffum have been
; picking up extra points, while Ay
! Lett Cotton, the hardest fighting
j runner on the squad, is clicking off
j 27 flat.
Cinder Points Expected
Al Blackman and Todd are the
j chief frosh hopes in the dashes.
: Blackman steps over the century in
j a trifle more than 10 seconds, usual
;ly leading Todd to the tape by
i inches.
| Devlin and Vincent have won the
! middle-distance assignments, but
| the J.C. runners are likely to fur-
I nish more competition than is de
j sirable from the scoreboard angle,
i The two will "break into the scoring
column, but whether or not they
j will be good enough to lead the
i Sacramento boys to the finish de
| pends upon whether the Jaysee
| speedster's can improve on the
i marks set last year.
Field Events Weak
Phil Morentin looks like a sure
point-getter in the mile. Clocked at
4:4G in the All-Star fracas, Phil can
cut this down under fighting com
petition.
The only field events that Stan
j ford is favored to cop are the high
j jump and discus. Lloyd Schween
| cleared 5 feet IV/z inches last Sat
| urday and made it look easy. He
j may repeat. Herb Joslin is con-
I ceded a fighting chance to win the
I discus. The other field events are
| doubtful. Beatty and Wyman have
i tossed the spear for good distances,
j but have broken no startling rec
t ords as yet. Joslin, switching from
| the platter to the shot, is likely
1 to collect either a place or show.
In the broad jump Bowles and
i Peters are given outside chances of
j surprising.

Field Events Weak
Phil Morentin looks like a sure
point-getter in the mile. Clocked at
4:4G in the All-Star fracas, Phil can
cut this down under fighting com
petition.
The only field events that Stan
j ford is favored to cop are the high
j jump and discus. Lloyd Schween
| cleared 5 feet IV/z inches last Sat
| urday and made it look easy. He
j may repeat. Herb Joslin is con-
I ceded a fighting chance to win the
I discus. The other field events are
| doubtful. Beatty and Wyman have
i tossed the spear for good distances,
j but have broken no startling rec
t ords as yet. Joslin, switching from
| the platter to the shot, is likely
1 to collect either a place or show.
In the broad jump Bowles and
i Peters are given outside chances of
j surprising.
Strong in the cinder events, but
j still a bit wobbly in the field com
i petition, Bill Ellington's freshman
' oval stars will seek revenge on
Sacramento Junior College Satur
day morning for the defeat suffered
| last year from the combined forces
' of the J.C. and Sacramento High's
i championship prep squad.
After being nosed out in their

Strong Timber Toppers
j Approximately a foot shorter
i than an orthodox hurdler should be,
I Bowles is stepping over the high
