# SENIOR HOOPSTERS RATED OVER SOPHS IN CONTEST TODAY
## 
### 
Senior hoopsters are given a de
j cided edge over the sophomores
: when they clash tomorrow after
! noon at 4:20 o'clock in the second
round of the W.A.A. series. They
I head the interclass standing so far,
having won all their games.
When the two teams met in the
first round the seniors handed the
| lowerclassmen a severe trouncing,
and since then have shown rather
i consistent form. Their guards are
as strong a combination as can be
| found on any class team, while the
I forwards have accurate shots as

well as clever plays.
However, the sophomores have
been picking up during the past
week, with their forwards showing
a little more of the get-together
spirit, and the guards, who were
always fair, improving somewhat. Vu
the team as a whole plays its best,
it will give the seniors at least
score, if not a good game.
