# New Records Expected In U.C. Meet Saturday
## 
### DICK VAN WAGENEN 
Despite the slow Athens Club
pool, the Cardinal freshman swim
mers should manage to break a few
records when the varsity and fresh
man California meets come off in
Oakland Saturday night. The Bear
yearlings hold only one meet rec
ord, in the 220-yard relay. This
event, which would be certain to
fall before the Indian onslaught,
will not be swum off, but instead a
short relay of unannounced length
will take its place.
Two events which are bound to
call forth new records are the
breast- and back-stroke. Jim Bene*,
in the former, has been swimming
consistently 13 seconds better than
the record for the 220 yards, but
the two outstanding Bear yearlings,
will have to run up against one of
Langworthy, who will be no easy
meat.
Bill Rogers is a cinch to come
through with a new back-stroke
mark when he enters the pool for
the 150-yard event. In the Encina
pools Rogers would shatter the old
time by some six seconds, but at

] the Club he is conceded only a one
| or two-second margin.
Nothing has come up to mitigate ;
the sadness of the varsity men, who 1
j will be held back from setting a '
I number of new Pacific Coast rec
i ords by the slow pool. Only one 1
| mark stands a chance of being re
| placed-â€”the 400-yard relay. Captain i
; Frank Booth, John McKelvey, Ted ;
Wiget, and Tuppy Gardner should ;
be able to shatter the Pacific Coast j
j record in this event, but the expert j
quartet will have to bid its time
i until the Nationals at the end of ;
| this month to flash its real speed
j for a possible new National Inter- j
j collegiate mark.
Tuppy Gardner will swim about j
two seconds slower in the hundred j
1 at the Club than he could in the !
J Encina pools, and every event but j
i the diving will be slowed up. Frank
1 Pilling and George Kothe are the i
Blue and Gold hopes in the free- '
style events, although they are not i
quite on a plane with the Stanford
mermen. In diving, however, Puck
er, of Berkeley, is of national inter- 1
collegiate calibre.
