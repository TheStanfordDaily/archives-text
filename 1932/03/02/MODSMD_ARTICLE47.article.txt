# Card Polomen Play Midwick
## Game Planned Saturday At Los Angeles 
### Bill Myers 
After a rather hectic week in the
Southwest during which time the
mighty Arizona Wildcats were
finally downed, 10-7, the Cardinal
polo team returned to the campus
yesterday to re-acquaint themselves
with forgotten texts and to recu
perate from the numberless teas,
luncheons, and banquets with which
they were feted after their victory.
Today practice will be resumed,
for .so impressed were representa
tives of the Midwick Country Club
of Los Angeles with the team's
showing that the Redshirts have
been invited to play a match with
this high-speed outfit this Saturday
at Los Angejcs. The Riviera Coun
try Club also asked the team for a
match last Sunday, but regulations
concerning athletic competition on
Sunday made it impossible for
Stanford to accept.
The same squad as last week will
make the trip this week for the
Midwick match. Bruce Fleming,
whom Tucson sports writers called
the "iron man" of the Stanford de
fense, will play at back; Pete Lewis,
equally as brilliant, and an excel
lent team man, will hold down
number three position. Up in front
will be Pete Gillham at number one
and Rufus Spalding at two.
