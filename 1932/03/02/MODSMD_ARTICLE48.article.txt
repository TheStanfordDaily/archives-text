# Babe Batters Defeated By Sequoia Union High
## 
### 
Falling before the onslaught of
the Sequoia Union High School ball
club, C-2, yesterday, the Stanford
freshman team bemoaned its third
loss of the season.
Although the frosh suffered their
severest defeat so far as the score
was concerned, the Redskins dis
played a smoother brand of ball
than they usually hand out. With
Al Semmelroth on the mound and
Fred Heringer, regular hurler, in
the hospital, the frosh were forced
out of their usual layout and were
unable to break the spell that prep
school ball teams seem to cast over
the yearlings.
