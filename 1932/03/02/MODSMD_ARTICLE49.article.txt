# Revamped S.C. Nine Enters Conference
## Garrett Arbelbide Given Left Field job 
### Bob Wade 
, With the Stanford varsity base
ball team's Southern invasion ap
! preaching by leaps and bounds, and
| the last Daily of the quarter sched
uled for next Tuesday, it seems
! timely to sum up the situations that
j the Cardinals will have to meet
! when they lace U.S.C.
Reports from the South at the
. beginning of the season indicated
' that U.S.C. would have to build up
lan entire new outfield and find a
| new catcher before counting them
i selves in the conference race.
Arbelbide Left Field
• From first base the Trojans have
j moved Captain Garrett Arbelbide
I to left field, and in his place have
put Curt Youel with last year's
1 substitute, "Hook" Hudson, in re-
I serve.
Bob Allaire, smooth-working
I shortstop from the 1934 yearling
j aggregation, has stepped into the
; second-base berth, and appears to
, have the job cinched.
1 At shortstop Troy will present
Orv Mohler, who led the league in
hitting last year with a flashy .511
j average, and on third they will have
j the veteran A1 Hildebrand.
i Center field seems to have gone
to the fleet-footed Ernie Stewart,
j while Herb Rothwill has beaten out
; Benny McPhee for the right-garden
i assignment.
Bankston in Action
Although Mohler is scheduled to
! hold down the short patch for the
S Trojans, in the first two conference
j games against U.S.F., Gene Banks
i ton, who substituted for Hildebrand
■; last year, has been performing in
ithe league-leader's position. Herb
! Barsumian and and Jim Minisian
j have taken over Joe Ward's place
behind the bat and so far neither
seems to have any edge.
Coach Sam Barry's pitching staff
is dominated by the flashy George
j "Buck" Buchanan. Next in line are
Johnnie Gooch and Gene Upton,
| with four more or less unknown
I reserves to help out in the pinches.
Judgment Difficult
In their first two stars, the Tro
j jans' play was dominated by the
j powerful hitting of Arbelbide, who
j gathered seven hits in his first nine
1 appearances at the plate.

Judgment Difficult
In their first two stars, the Tro
j jans' play was dominated by the
j powerful hitting of Arbelbide, who
j gathered seven hits in his first nine
1 appearances at the plate.
, With the Stanford varsity base
ball team's Southern invasion ap
! preaching by leaps and bounds, and
| the last Daily of the quarter sched
uled for next Tuesday, it seems
! timely to sum up the situations that
j the Cardinals will have to meet
! when they lace U.S.C.
Reports from the South at the
. beginning of the season indicated
' that U.S.C. would have to build up
lan entire new outfield and find a
| new catcher before counting them
i selves in the conference race.
Arbelbide Left Field
• From first base the Trojans have
j moved Captain Garrett Arbelbide
I to left field, and in his place have
put Curt Youel with last year's
1 substitute, "Hook" Hudson, in re-
I serve.
Bob Allaire, smooth-working
I shortstop from the 1934 yearling
j aggregation, has stepped into the
; second-base berth, and appears to
, have the job cinched.
1 At shortstop Troy will present
Orv Mohler, who led the league in
hitting last year with a flashy .511
j average, and on third they will have
j the veteran A1 Hildebrand.
i Center field seems to have gone
to the fleet-footed Ernie Stewart,
j while Herb Rothwill has beaten out
; Benny McPhee for the right-garden
i assignment.
Bankston in Action
Although Mohler is scheduled to
! hold down the short patch for the
S Trojans, in the first two conference
j games against U.S.F., Gene Banks
i ton, who substituted for Hildebrand
■; last year, has been performing in
ithe league-leader's position. Herb
! Barsumian and and Jim Minisian
j have taken over Joe Ward's place
behind the bat and so far neither
seems to have any edge.
Coach Sam Barry's pitching staff
is dominated by the flashy George
j "Buck" Buchanan. Next in line are
Johnnie Gooch and Gene Upton,
| with four more or less unknown
I reserves to help out in the pinches.
