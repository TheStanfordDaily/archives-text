## Greatest Contribution Is University Founding 
### 
Reviewing the services of Leland
I Stanford to public welfare, George
! T. Clark, emeritus director of Stan
| ford University Libraries* spoke last
! night in the Little Theatre on "Le
j land Stanford as a Public Man."
Stanford's three great contribu
tions to California, according to
Clark, include his work as governor
of the state during the Civil War,
!as president and promoter of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, and as
i the founder of the University.
: Stanford started his career as a
public figure in 1856, when he was
instrumental in establishing the Re
publican party in California. Twice
accepting nominations for offices
| that he knew he could be elected to,
| and serving the state as its first Re
publican governor during the crucial
time when the secession question
threatened to draw California from
the Union, and later as United
! States Senator, Stanford remained to
the end of his life a powerful po
! litical figure.
As a railroad builder and execu
! tive, Clark explained, Stanford's
work included financing the venture
: at the expense of the four Sacra
| mento merchants who backed the
| plan, and working out a system in
! which even the government had lit
tle faith. Later he had charge of
handling the tremendous work of
communication and transportation of
war supplies that the railroad made
possible.
After the death of his son, around
whom all his plans had centered,
| Stanford decided to establish a school
, through which '"he might help other
men's sons," Clark said. The uni
! versity he planned was to be one
| which sponsored "practical education
j rather than education on a higher
plane of learning." To this end he
deeded his Palo Alto estate and two
| farms to the trustees, and provided
an endowment for the University.
This gift, Clark said, was unprece
dented in the history of the country,
and gave Stanford the name of "the
most munificent benefactor of Cali
fornia."
