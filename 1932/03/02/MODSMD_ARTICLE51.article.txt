With the democratic convention just over the hill, Alfred E. Smith,
who is willing to carry the party's standard again if selected, gets some
new shoes for the 1932 campaign. At the same time he reminisces over
a pair of child's shoes, similar to the ones he bought 53 years ago from
the same clerk, Thomas Groundwater.
