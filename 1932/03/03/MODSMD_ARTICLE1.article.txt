# Masque Ball Is Set For Campus Spring Festival
## Rally Committee Decides to Revive Annual Affair After Two-Year Lapse; Boyles Announces Election For King to Be Held April 11-13 QUEEN TO BE PICKED FROM "500" OR MILLS Proceeds Go to Fund for Convalescent Home; Weird Costumes to Feature Colorful Event 
### 
NOELS, fairies, local Ingagi's, pansies, and Hairy Apes .... in other
words, all of (lie Stanford roughs will again conic into their own.
And soon, too! For once again, after a two-year interval, the annual
Masque Ball will top social festivities of the spring quarter.
One of the most colorful events in campus life, the Ball permits one
and all to conie-as-you-like, and the rough (at least one of him) is KINO!'
In announcing (lie event, Chairman Ed Boyles of the Rally Committee,

which is sponsoring the event, dc- '
dared that the afTair will take over
the Farm 011 the evening of Friday,
April 15, in the Pavilion.
Royal Election
Delving into the matter of who
or what shall grace the throne for
the evening, investigation reveals
that a campus election will start
April 11 and continue through April
13. And all who run for regal honors |
must proclaim in advance their in
dividual "alias" for the evening.
Thus it is probably to be expected
that such monikers as "Rush-or- i
Hike" Cordry, "Bringem Younger"
Friendlich, or "Stewed Prince from
Oxford" Brown will pop into the
limelight at any moment.
The lucky monarch will be privi
leged to pick his own Queen ....
and the rules state that she may
hail from either Mills or Stanford,
with no lines of distinction to be
drawn. No slam intended for the
"500," the committee added. Voting
will be conducted at a premium,
with the price being set at one cent
per ballot.
Funds Needed
Proceeds from the affair are to go '
for the benefit of the Stanford Con
valescent Home. Although the event
was discontinued last year, the
Rally Committee decided to stage
the frolic this spring because of the j
need of funds for the Convalescent j
Home.
Setting the tentative price of bids
at $2, Boyles announced the follow- '
ing committee chairmen: music, Art |
Miller; decorations, Gilbert Carr; 1
king contest, Bob Churchill; floor,
Larry Harris; refreshments, Bill
Campbell; chaperones, Charles Karl.
A torchlight parade of the nominees j
is being planned for the election I
period.
Investigation into the annals of j
the past reveals that in 1930 one
Thad McNamara (heap big tough
guy) attended the Ball disguised, so
they say, as an angel. Situations and
other funny circumstances combined
to produce amusing gobs of humor
for the masked wonders.
Queer Names
It further develops that other
weird costumes in the past include
"Tarzan" wild-men, several self
styled "Wot-a-Man" funsters, one
"Goober" Lippitt, another "He
won't-muff-it" Moffatt, and a fancy
"Twinkletoes" Woodruff. There was
also one brave, bold rough who
modestly proclaimed himself "Our
Hero."
Speculation is already running
high as to what types of prospective
kings will grace the campus this
season. Anyway, it certainly won't
be long now.
The Graf Zeppelin will make four
trips to South America this year.

also one brave, bold rough who
modestly proclaimed himself "Our
Hero."
Speculation is already running
high as to what types of prospective
kings will grace the campus this
season. Anyway, it certainly won't
be long now.
The Graf Zeppelin will make four
trips to South America this year.
NOELS, fairies, local Ingagi's, pansies, and Hairy Apes .... in other
words, all of (lie Stanford roughs will again conic into their own.
And soon, too! For once again, after a two-year interval, the annual
Masque Ball will top social festivities of the spring quarter.
One of the most colorful events in campus life, the Ball permits one
and all to conie-as-you-like, and the rough (at least one of him) is KINO!'
In announcing (lie event, Chairman Ed Boyles of the Rally Committee,

which is sponsoring the event, dc- '
dared that the afTair will take over
the Farm 011 the evening of Friday,
April 15, in the Pavilion.
Royal Election
Delving into the matter of who
or what shall grace the throne for
the evening, investigation reveals
that a campus election will start
April 11 and continue through April
13. And all who run for regal honors |
must proclaim in advance their in
dividual "alias" for the evening.
Thus it is probably to be expected
that such monikers as "Rush-or- i
Hike" Cordry, "Bringem Younger"
Friendlich, or "Stewed Prince from
Oxford" Brown will pop into the
limelight at any moment.
The lucky monarch will be privi
leged to pick his own Queen ....
and the rules state that she may
hail from either Mills or Stanford,
with no lines of distinction to be
drawn. No slam intended for the
"500," the committee added. Voting
will be conducted at a premium,
with the price being set at one cent
per ballot.
Funds Needed
Proceeds from the affair are to go '
for the benefit of the Stanford Con
valescent Home. Although the event
was discontinued last year, the
Rally Committee decided to stage
the frolic this spring because of the j
need of funds for the Convalescent j
Home.
Setting the tentative price of bids
at $2, Boyles announced the follow- '
ing committee chairmen: music, Art |
Miller; decorations, Gilbert Carr; 1
king contest, Bob Churchill; floor,
Larry Harris; refreshments, Bill
Campbell; chaperones, Charles Karl.
A torchlight parade of the nominees j
is being planned for the election I
period.
Investigation into the annals of j
the past reveals that in 1930 one
Thad McNamara (heap big tough
guy) attended the Ball disguised, so
they say, as an angel. Situations and
other funny circumstances combined
to produce amusing gobs of humor
for the masked wonders.
Queer Names
It further develops that other
weird costumes in the past include
"Tarzan" wild-men, several self
styled "Wot-a-Man" funsters, one
"Goober" Lippitt, another "He
won't-muff-it" Moffatt, and a fancy
"Twinkletoes" Woodruff. There was
also one brave, bold rough who
