### COLLIER CONNELL 
One person, at least, on the cam- )
! pus, may claim a face-to-face ac
j quuiiVlance with a Lindbergh baby.
Out in the print-shop back of the
Daily, Charlie Werner, composing- '
I room foreman- reading type upside
! down and backward, as is the curi
ous talent hf all printers—fits a
j graphic dispatch of the Lindbergh
I kidnapping into a Daily front-page
' form.
And remembers when he used to
j pause on his desultory, fence-kick
j ing route to school, in order to peer
] in at the Lindbergh Baby Before
This One, the original Lindy, lying j
j content in a sway-backed buggy, j
1 parked at its front door stoop in
Little Falls, Minnesota,
Lawyer Charles Lindbergh, popu- '
lar for his good brains and legal
ladeptness among the (!,()()() populu- i

| tion of the lumber town, was as yet j
unaware of the steps which were j
leading toward Congress.
Evangeline Lodge Lindbergh, at - I
' tractive young mother, was still new j
to Ihe housekeeping racket in Little
Falls, and though refusing to vouch j
for her pink dimity dress and mar- .
ket-basket, Printer Charlie Wegner
docs revision her strolling Lindy's i
. buggy downstreet, stopping some- 1
times on errands in the news office j
of the weekly for which he worked.
Now, under white surgeon's lights,
bending over the heavy slab on ;
j which each day's Daily is born, for I
j the delectation of a morning cam
pus—Wegner, following the nation- 1
! wide search, backwards for him in
the type, is amused to recall the
! other Lindy, kidnapper-free, sun
i ning in wicker buggy.
