# U.C.L.A. GUIDED BY NEW COACH
## Bruins Boast A Powerful Pitching Staff 
### 
After a week of practice, the
Detroit baseball club will play
a five-inning game Saturday
during the regular period from
10:.'50-1 :l{o o'clock. Teams will
be picked from the squad now
working out daily on the Stan
ford varsity baseball team's
field.
With all the teams in the confer
ence having at least two games be
hind them, Stanford is beginning to
, size up the opposition that it will
meet during the impending South
ern trip.
Down at U.C.L.A. the Bruins have
a brand new mentor in A1 Mont
gomery, who was a diamond star in
his undergraduate days when the
campus was on Vermont avenue in
Los Angeles. In addition to their
i new chief, they have a number of
j new satellites who promise to make
i the teams up here work for the con
i ference crown.
Pitchers Plentiful
Led by Tom "Mophead" Murphy,
who handed Stanford one of its
three defeats last year, the pitching
I corps includes: Bud Rose, who will
I probably be very good, according to
Harry Wolter; Bill Winter, who has
I already beaten the University of
j San Francisco; and Paul Weber, a
. mediocre southpaw, who may be
; made into a dependable relief
j twirier.
Mike Frankovitch, peppery soph
omore, has crowded last year's
catchers, Ralph Koontz and Bernie
I Levin, completely out of the pic
, ture.
Veteran First-Saekcr
At first base the Westwooders
present their two-year veteran,
j Captain Bill Brubaker, who was
mentioned en the lfloO all-Coast
I team; while on second Ihe winner
of the Bill Athey-Gene Hirsch bat
; tie will get the call.
The shortstop job seems to rest
' between Church, Berry and Steven
son, with the latter looking the best
I so far.
