# WAGNER, GRIEG TO BE PLAYED BY ORCHESTRA
## Program Of Varied Music Will Feature Soloist Elena Hitchcock 
### 
Wagner's Prelude to the "Meister
j singers of Nuremburg" will be the
! opening number of a versatile pro
j gram to be presented by the Stan
-1 ford Symphony Orchestra in the
' Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock this
j evening. Marguerite MacManus is
I the conductor.
The prelude to Wagner's famous
l opera consists of three different
I themes first played separately and
| then woven together with wonderful
I skill, enhancing the beauty of each.
Russian Numbers
I A suite of Russian numbers,
| "Caucasian Sketches," by Ippolitow
j Iwanow, will follow. Ippolitow
| Iwanow is ranked among the fore
j most of the modern Russian com
j posers. In his suite of beautiful
melodies are portrayed the echoing
cries of Russian tribesmen in the
j mountain defiles, the call of the
: muezzin from the mosque, and the
j parade of the villagers to the
j mosque at the hour of prayer.
Grieg's "Heartswounds" and "Last
; Spring,' two elegiac melodies, are
I beautiful, plaintive laments. They
will be played by the string instru
ments.
Hitchcock to Play
Elena Hitchcock, talented young
pnainist of San Mateo, will play the
concluding number, Grieg's "Con
certo in A Minor," accompanied by
the orchestra. Miss Hitchcock re
j ceived much praise for her playing
in a joint recital with Warren D.
Allen, University organist, at Roble
Hall last summer.
The first movement of Grieg's
Concerto, the only one he ever
i wrote, is replete with beautiful,
I haunting melodies, and the muted
strings of the orchestra make it one
of the saddest of preludes. The sec
ond movement features strong, pas
sionate Viking rhythms.
