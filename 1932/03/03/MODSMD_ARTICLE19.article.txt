A sudden spurt at the opening of
the second half carried the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon five to a 19-18 vic
tory over Kappa Alpha yesterday
afternoon at the Pavilion.
After a first half in which Kappa
Alpha held a 10-6 lead, the S.A.E.'s,
with Murray Holloway in the main
role, quickly pulled up on their ri
vals at the opening of the second
period. They went out in front, 14-
13, and ran their total up to 19
before the K.A.'s woke up,
Fijis Lose
Alpha Delta Phi ran true to form
and took the Fiji five into camp
15-11. Charles Lee and Bill Fuller
contributed six points apiece to the
winning cause, with John Bacon
marking up the same score for Phi
Gamma Delta.
Zeta Psi went into a tie for sec
ond place in League II by defeat
ing Sequoia I 14-10, with Chuck
Coberly scoring 7 of the 14 points.
Viguie made four of Sequoia's total.
Encina 2W won another game by
forfeit when the Delta Tau Delta
team failed to show up. Sigma Nu
also failed to put in an appearance
for their scheduled encounter with
Phi Delta Phi, so it is likely that
this game will go to the law quintet.
