# STANFORD'S SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
## 
### 
Three years ago, tindci' the direction of Daniel Rrvant, i
two students, Rourne Eaton and Leland Long, and Ehvyn
tJugge, tennis coach, started the Stanford Symphony Or-'
chestra. Though the going was hard at tirst, the orchestra,
aided by a suhstantial monetary gift, was gradually in
creased in numbers and types of instruments until it at-,
taincd the present size of (ill pieces.
Last year the orchestra was honored by being featured
on the program for the last night of Music Week at the
Municipal Auditorium in San Francisco. It also gave five ,
campus concerts.
This year the orchestra is under the direction of Mrs.
Marguerite MacManus, who was formerly connected with
the music departments of the t'niversity of Idaho and Ore
gon State College.
The Symphony Concert tonight in the Assembly Hall
will be well worth the attendance of campus music-lovers.
If this school cannot support the concert series, it should at
least back Ibis organization which not only is for the enter
tainment of the students but whose personnel consists;
largely of campus members.
