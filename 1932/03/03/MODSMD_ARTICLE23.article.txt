will launch a match with the Presidio Club on the campus
course, and continuing with various frosh contests at 1(1

usually last until 1 o'clock or later.
Of course, the first meet of the budding track season
will claim the greatest amount of attention, but the immi
nent prospect of seeing numerous college records smashed
by Cardinal aquatic stars should draw a considerable
crowd to the swimming tanks for the annual California
meet. Water polo, always a rough and exciting sport, will
give spectators who stay through the swimming events an
added thrill, especially if the players follow custom by
spending most of their time in attemnls to drown each
other. Recollections of the t.S.C. man who lost bis suit
during a game here last year should help the attendance tit
this contest.
However, those who prefer sports of a more refined
nature will find events to please their taste in the varsity
and freshman fencing matches with the Rears in the Pa
vilion. A short step up lo Rurlingame will provide tennis
fanciers with the entertaining spectacle of Cardinal netmcn
engaging Rurlingame Tennis Club athletes on the club
courts, while those who demand the national pastime may
journey to Moraga, where Harry Wolter's hopefuls will
cross bats with St. Mary's.
All in all, be will be a hard fan to please indeed, who
cannot find something to occupy his time Ibis next sunny
Saturday.
