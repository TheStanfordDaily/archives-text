I hat unfortunate incident at the University of California
"Sirkus" Tuesday night which resulted in injury to five
students can he taken as a timely warning by Stanford.
in vicing for honors in the float competition, a fraternity
entry unwittingly hecanie too realistic for safety. Its float,
representing a gangster car, /oomed through the streets
tiring machine 1411ns into the moh. Wadding from the blank
cartridges they were using struck listudents to inflict
wounds that required hospital treatment.
Tomorrow ni 14111 Stanford's annual carnival will he
staged in the Pavilion. Though there will he no floats car
rying semi-pseudo 14a ngsters, possibilities for mishaps loom
numerous.
For example, at lasl year's affair an over ambitious
gathering of fortune seekers were trying their luck at toss
ing small rings over prizes on a table some distance from
the rail behind which they were supposed to stand. At
tempting to fudge, the young men in question leaned their
combined weight too heavily on the llimsy railing. It broke
and four suffered bruises in the pile-up. That might have
been more serious.
I lien, too, there is the possibility of heart relapse among
roughs who frequent fortune telling booths wherein fair
members of the .">0(1 will hold said roughs' hands, osfensiblv
for the purpose of palm reading.
Watch it up. fellows!
