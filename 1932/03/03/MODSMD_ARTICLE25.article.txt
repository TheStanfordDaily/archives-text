## ON SARCASM—THAT DEADLY STUFF 
### 
When Voltaire picked up his pen,
the blood-pressure, discomfort, and
temperature of kings and bishops
had a corresponding rise. People
feared the ''Genius of Mockery"
even though he rarely would add
new arguments to the current dis
cussions. He did more, however, to
advance las liberal ideas than all
the learned scholars massing then
authorities and arguments with te
dious precision. Any argument can
be answered—but sarcasm is only
answerable with more sarcasm. Au
thority can be matched with au
thority on the other side but irony
and its brood are irrefutable.
Most people don't mind being
wrong--but to be ridiculed usually
devastates them. In that fact lies
the strength of sarcasm. But genuine
wit and vitriol have one drawback;
they can be met by similar tactics
by the other people. Another Voltaire
could have answered Voltaire -but,
fortunately for him, there was none.
There is one form of expression,
however, which is almost .100 per
cent invulnerable. There is only one
type of writing which cannot be
met in any manner, shape, or form.
And that elusive verbal weapon is
attempted sarcasm.
But while it is true that attempted
sarcasm is absolutely impregnable

I from attacks by argument, wit. au
thority, or divine revelation, it is
also true that, as a weapon, it is
about as effective as an eye-dropper,
j Arm one army with eye-droppers;
arm the other with accepted wea
pons; what will be the result? The
; optic-sprayers, if they can get far
enough away and completely out of
the line of battle, will remain un
| scathed and come home decorated
J with laurel wreaths which they
j were busy picking while the rest
I were fighting.
But on the other hand, arm two
opponents with similar weapons—
j and terrific damage on both sides
results. Yet, many claim that the
j best attack on this attempted sar
, casm, whose deviosity is surpassed
only by its uubiosity, is a complete
indifference. That sounds logical,
and if these soldiers carried nothing
but eye-droppers, a cold shoulder
and a blank stare would be very
j effective weapons indeed.
But the double is that these
strangely armed individuals usually
: carry horns—loud and deep. They
blow with their horns and fight with
their eye-droppers—but many peo
i pie hear only the noise, and run
from the fight. The result is sweep
ing victory. Their defeat is assured
' when people walk upon them un
noticed and see them picking laurel
j leaves. —Abe Mcllinkofi:
