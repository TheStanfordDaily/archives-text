# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
lo verily we say unto you wind- '
jammer hath developed a new per- ,
sonality and now delveth deep into
the wells of learning to see what ;
salamanders or other miscellaneous '
unnecessities have slipped in during
the last couple of rainy seasons
and lo deep in the pages of his- '
tory we find a statement that the
rock of gibraltar is the most morti- j
fied rock in the world
and according to our own pet
volume of political history the
president of the united states
has the power to appoint and
disappoint the members of Siis
cabinet
consider the lilies of the field they
toil not neither do they spin 01 have ,
exes or sunburn or spring fever or
noisy roommates and still they are j
lilies and a lily is not a crow
and verity the lowest form of
animal is called a nomad and
lives in a cell

it is a long road that has no turn
ing and yet the road to la honda is
long even in spring
every seeker of easy divorce
who crosses into Mexican terri
tory is required to repeat the
Mexican motto which is remem
ber the alimony
you cant get blood from a turnip
or service from the cellar or an a
from most of the french department
do as you would be done by
or knock the other fellow down
on quad before he gets a chance
at you
necessity is the mother of inven
tion t oordinary men to the five
hundred only a bone of contention
we fear
an apple a day keeps the doc
tor away but its kind of hard
011 a family of worms
a good way to memorize poetry

is to say it after you go to sleep at
night
one little sheep jumped over the
fence
and another one followed in time
oh my gosh you are horribly dense
if you dont get the point of this
rhyme
an infantry is a place where
people go to adopt babies
entymology is how you tell the
difference between a bug and a
tractor we mean a caterpillar
leap year is a year when
women can propose to men just
like in the years before and af
ter leap year or any other time
the fall of quebee was a cold
fall with light frost
the way of the assessor is hard in
these times of depression
its an ill wind that blows nobody
any good or even the awful lest trash
comes to an end at last
A Guthrie, Okla., post of the
American Legion has an unofficial
humorist named Tony Boloney.
