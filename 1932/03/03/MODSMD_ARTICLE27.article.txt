To the Editor:
Pause while I don the mantle of
Freud the Revealer and sit in judg
ment over Mr. Hanover's diatrible
of yesterday. Under the guise of a
criticism—and what a diaphonous
garment it*, was -of Mr. Mellinkoff's
opinions on polities, economics, Phi
Betes and what not, Mr. Harrover
slipped on us his personal preju
dices generally against our column
ist, and upon his name specifically.
Nuw I assume that no extended
stream of reasoning is necessary for
the realization that a descent to per
sonalities is about the lowest depth
to which criticism can sink. How I
do shudder to think of the tribula
tions which await Tschaikowski,
Komroff, Bercovici, Dvorak, Mestro
vic, and Noguchi when (or "if ever")
their names come within the ken of
the euphonius and meticulously
minded Mr. Harrover. But perhaps
il was not so generic a fault which
caused his vexation. In that case we
should of course be ever thankful
for Mr, Harrover's fine sense of re
straint; for who knows but that we
would have been regaled with sly
ironic references to Wilebuoy soap,
Fisterine, and the advantages of
Three Easy Lessons in the Latest
Dance Steps.
And so I extend my condolences
to Abe Mellinkoff for his lack of
foresight in not having chosen to
be born of the progeny of Wodin,
May he live it down.
