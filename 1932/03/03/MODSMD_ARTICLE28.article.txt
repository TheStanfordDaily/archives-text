Till! PASSIONATE PI I WIH.R—At
the Varsity Theatre.
| That too much tragedy makes
j comedy has often been proved but
' it is seldom that great quantities of
comedy, and slapstick at that, re
j suit in real comedy.
In order to realize the extent to
J which the ludicrous is employed
I you will please envisage two women
I simultaneously throwing trays full
lof china at one benighted and
I charming gentleman (Gilbert Ro
land). This is the sort of stud that
might be taken from any seven
reel comic, to be sure. But when
the passionate Spanish lady finishes
by throwing her arms about the
j man's neck and exclaiming: "Just
! see how much I love you," we saw
j that it was a ripping good show.
Of course the story is all about
Buster Keaton, the dumb plumber,
Elmer. Brought in at first as an
impromptu gigolo, Elmer, after in
i terrupting love scenes with strenu
! ous gargling, and, ah—sheaving no
i notion of etiquette generally, ends
j with getting the girl, Irene Purcell.
And what a git he got—she is turn
ing out to have a sense of humor
jas well as considerable histrionic
ability. —E.T.P.
WIVES OF HENRY VIII—At the
Columbia Theatre, San Francisco
Cornelia Otis Skinner puts on the
whole show by herself, thereby be
coming a feminine Will Rogers. The
rope which she whirls before the
audience is her versatile personality
\ ever changing throughout the vari
| ous impersonations and character
; sketches.
This charming young actress is
the author of all of her sketches
which she presents most entertain
ingly. The first part of the program
is made up of some more contem
porary sketches and the second half
of the evening is devoted to the
j scenes concerning the six fascinat
ing wives of Henry VIII.
Miss Skinner's discrimination is
i keen, her costuming is beautifully
and cleverly done and her portray
als, distinct and convincing.

SHERLOCK HOLMES' FATAL
HOUR—At the New Menlo
This production is an entirely
new type of story—it's different
from the usual run of movie detec
tive yarns and the change is far for
the better.

it is produced in England and dis
tributed by the Ameranglo corpora
tion. One thing we miss about it is
that we don't see any actors or
1 actresses that we particularly re
member seeing before.
This loss is compensated, how
ever, by excellent acting on the part
ol Arthur Wontner, who plays
Sherlock Holmes. His interpretation
'of the famous detective is all that
| any lover of Sir Conan Doyle's hero
| could wish it to be.
The plot is a combination of two
jof the better-known Sherlock
: Holmes stories. Action does not
drag, things occur in logical se
i quenee, and even the inimitable
Holmes atmosphere is preserved to
the end. The final fade-out is of
I Holmes playing softly on his violin.
Even the most sophisticated Stan
ford Rough will find that "Sherlock
Holmes' Fatal Hour" is a worth
while evening's entertainment.
As to the rest of the program,
we've even forgotten what the com
edy was and there was one of these
! educational shorts on life in a Girl
Scout camp. Perfectly silly.
