# 'Sabine Women' Best Of Plays
## Attendance Small At Bill Of One-Act Dramas 
### Harrison Foss 
j What with the depression, Greta
Garbo, and Buster Keaton showing
in Palo Alto, and the Palo Alto
Community Theatre presenting
similar programs for 25 cents per,
; it seems absurd that the Dramatic
Council should ask to see the
! Council should ask 50 cents to see
the quarterly one-act bills. At least
last night's audience was very small.
The program was better than the
usual bill with "The Sabine Women"
by Ruth Krenz leading the field.
The complete cast is as follows:
Claudia, Frances Slanina; Julia,
I Jane Deser.berg; Marcus, Louis
] Moore; Quintus, Marvin Miller; di
| rection, Herbert Crocker. Outstand
ing high-points of this "classic"
farce were, Miller's knees, the white
i nightgowns tied in the middle, and
! Moore losing his trousers.
Waldo Salt's original one-act,
"The Ingrate," was very much in
i the negro spirit telling the other
j side of the emancipation story. The
! harmony, although tending toward
' a vaudeville effect, was delightful.
Beulah Dimmitt and Craig Thomas
were delightful. The only other role
was taken by Louis Moore.
The first play on the program
i failed to put across its bombastic
humor. Harold David's direction
showed a good deal of effort, but
was unable to overcome the inade
quacy of staging. Dona Laura was
acted by Eleanor Furst, who suc
ceeded very well in hiding Jose
phine Wilson for the short time the
latter was on stage. Also in the cast
were Craig Thomas and George
! Leavens.
