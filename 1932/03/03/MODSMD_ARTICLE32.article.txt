IF ANYBODY had ridden up in
a hearse last December and asked
any Stanford student how basket
ball prospects looked, said student
probably would have replied, "Pret
ty fair."
Ami if someone else had rid
den up in another hearse early
in January, after tlie Indians
had won a pair of thrilling
games from U.C.L.A., he would
have been told tiiat prospects
were rosy.
But. the fellow who rode up a
month or six weeks later would
have received only a dirty look,
even been told where he could go.
CONSIDERING THE stream of
injuries, sickness, leaves of absence,
and what not which struck the In
dian hoopsters during the late-la
mented season, it is hazardous to
do any predicting about the next.
But if you attribute the touyh
breaks of the season to one of those
queer turns of fate which might
occur once in a decade, but surely
not two years in a row, then Stan
lord's chances for next season look
very bright indeed.
A veteran team will be hack.
"We will lose only Doub of this
year's mainstays," Coach John
Bunn said yesterday afternoon
—although he had his lingers
crossed when he said it.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry, "Frenchy"
LaCombe, Cosgrove, Palmer, Meade,
and some promising subs will be
back to fill the forward berths.
Packard, with another much-needed
year of experience behind him, will
be back at center, with Jenkins as
a possible substitute. All of a fine
array of guards will return, includ
ing Norgard, Baker, Edelen, Tod,
Hancock, and Jenkins, if he doesn't j
play at the pivot position.
i
COACH BUNN is already laying I
plans for next season, although his '
fingers, as already recorded, may
usually be found crossed.
"We hope to start in next sea
son." the Indian mentor re
marked, "where we left off after
the first two U.C.L.A. games this
year." •
He expects to be better equipped
to make the race next year, and
will spend spring and autumn quar
ters working on departments of the
Indians' game which need strength
ening. He plans to develop a better
"held ball" offense, to strengthen j
the follow shot game on offense and
the recovery department under the '
basket on defense.
Another thing he intends to stress i
is the individual conditioning of the j
players. He pointed out that Stan- i
ford "won" several games in the i
first half this season, only to slump
in the second because of lack of
condition.
No, Bunn won't make any
definite predictions about 19:!.;, ' j
but lie keeps his lingers crossed
and looks forward to a lot of
hard work which may put Stan
ford in a far diiferent position
in (lie percentage column when
the final results are in next sea
son- —L.M.C.

He expects to be better equipped
to make the race next year, and
will spend spring and autumn quar
ters working on departments of the
Indians' game which need strength
ening. He plans to develop a better
"held ball" offense, to strengthen j
the follow shot game on offense and
the recovery department under the '
basket on defense.
Another thing he intends to stress i
is the individual conditioning of the j
players. He pointed out that Stan- i
ford "won" several games in the i
first half this season, only to slump
in the second because of lack of
condition.
No, Bunn won't make any
definite predictions about 19:!.;, ' j

hard work which may put Stan
ford in a far diiferent position

the final results are in next sea

IF ANYBODY had ridden up in
a hearse last December and asked
any Stanford student how basket
ball prospects looked, said student
probably would have replied, "Pret
ty fair."
Ami if someone else had rid
den up in another hearse early
in January, after tlie Indians
had won a pair of thrilling
games from U.C.L.A., he would
have been told tiiat prospects
were rosy.
But. the fellow who rode up a
month or six weeks later would
have received only a dirty look,
even been told where he could go.
CONSIDERING THE stream of
injuries, sickness, leaves of absence,
and what not which struck the In
dian hoopsters during the late-la
mented season, it is hazardous to
do any predicting about the next.
But if you attribute the touyh
breaks of the season to one of those
queer turns of fate which might
occur once in a decade, but surely
not two years in a row, then Stan
lord's chances for next season look
very bright indeed.
A veteran team will be hack.
"We will lose only Doub of this
year's mainstays," Coach John
Bunn said yesterday afternoon
—although he had his lingers
crossed when he said it.
"Tiny Tom" Cordry, "Frenchy"
LaCombe, Cosgrove, Palmer, Meade,
and some promising subs will be
back to fill the forward berths.
Packard, with another much-needed
year of experience behind him, will
be back at center, with Jenkins as
a possible substitute. All of a fine
array of guards will return, includ
ing Norgard, Baker, Edelen, Tod,
Hancock, and Jenkins, if he doesn't j
play at the pivot position.

COACH BUNN is already laying I
