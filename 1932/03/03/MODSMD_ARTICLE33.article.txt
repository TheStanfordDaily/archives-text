# POLO MATCH WITH MID WICK COUNTRY CLUB CALLED OFF
## 
### 
Some strange malady in the form
of a skin infection has so disabled
the mounts of the Midwick Country
Club of Los Angeles that Stanford's
polo match scheduled with this team
for Saturday has been indefinitely
postponed. The invitation for the
match was extended after members
of the Los Angeles club watched
the brilliant performance of the
Indians in the Arizona series last
week.
The same ailment that has put
most of the Midwick ponies on the
sick list is beginning to play havoc
with the Stanford mounts. Nearly
half the horses in the unit are prac
tically worthless for playing, and
practices have been greatly cur
tailed.
Local veterinarians have been
unable to find a cure for the in
fection.
