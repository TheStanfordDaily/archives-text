# Card- U. C. Swim Meet Changed To Encina Pool
## STANFORD TAKES EDGE OVER BEARS IN FASTER TANKS Indian Swimmers Threaten National 400-Yard Four Man Relay Mark 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
Complete revival swept through
the varsity swimming team with the
j announcement yesterday that the
[ California varsity-freshman meet
I will be held in the Encina pools
j instead of at the Athens Club Sat
| urday. Stock has gone up any num
' ber of points at th£ realization of
j the chance for record performances
I assured by the change from the slow
to the far faster pool.
Hostilities will commence at 1
| o'clock sharp with the 400-yard re
, lay. Here the crack team of Captain
j Frank Booth, John McKelvey,
;Tuppy Gardner, and Ted Wiget are
I set on thrashing their way to a new
, National Intercollegiate mark.
Frosh Records Totter
Following the initial record at
tempt will come a freshman event,
then alternating freshman and var-
I sity distances, followed by diving
| and both water polo games.
| Freshmen, who had planned to
j break at least two records despite
: the slow Athens Club lank, will
! cash in all the more cm their op
' portunily here Saturday. Jim Benet
J should be able to swim some thir
) teen seconds under the California
| Stanford freshman record in the
j 200-yard breaststroke, with Bill j
: Rogers a cinch to set a new back
j stroke mark for 150 yards some six
| seconds under the present record.
May Lower Coast Times
j Varsity men will waste no lime J
in the green waters of the home
pool when they set out to hang up j
j ne-w Pacific Coast times. McKelvey
| in the 50, Gardner in the 100, Booth
and Wiget in the 220, and Clapp in j
| the 440, all stand a chance of finish- |
ing ahead of the present record.
Fred Tebbetts may be in shape for I
l the 150-yard, as he is off the
! crutches and practicing regularly.
! Bob Clark will do no loafing in the !
| 200-yard breaststroke, and is a top
| heavy favorite to win.
Bear Poloists Strong
Water polo is more doubtful for
1 the Indians. California has tied the
Olympic Club, which humbled the
| varsity 9-5, and is expecting to 1
carry off polo honors. The Bear
yearling seven fell before Sequoia !
; High this year, but the freshman
| game should be no walk-away.
With one of the best swimming
| teams in the country, Stanford
rooters would have been deprived
;of seeing it in action at any time J
during ihe season if the California
meet had not been brought to the j
campus. The Card tankrnon travel ,
East to the Nationals, March 25, but
no more intercollegiate meets are ■
scheduled.
