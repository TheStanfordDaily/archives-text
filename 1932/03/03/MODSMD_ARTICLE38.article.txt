# STANFORD VARSITY AND FROSH GOLFERS MEET REARS AT BERKELEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
After one short practice round at
the Berkeley Castlewood course this
afternoon, the Stanford varsity and
freshman golfers will clash with the
Bears tomorrow morning in their
first conference match of the season.
Present indications are that the
Card club-swingers stand a good
chance to down the Californians. A
six-man team including such stars
as Charlie Seaver, one of the na
tion's outstanding amateurs; Harry
Eichelberger, ex-holder of the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate title, and
Dick Hoag, one of tht' few collegiate
qualifiers in the San Francisco City
Tournament last week, form a for
midable group of divot-diggers that
would be trouble to any opposition.
Other mainstays of the Indian
squad are Herman Hellman, who
ranks number three on the ladder;
Jerry Trautman, co-holder of the
course record here, and Stuart Haw
ley, who annexed the Junior Cham
pionships at Berkeley last fall. Be
sides, there are Brown, Thompson,
Dwyer, and Edwards, all of whom
play only a less brilliant golf
than their teammates.
Prospects for a freshman victory
are not as promising. The players'

' have shown a lot of enthusiasm and
put in many wearying practices, but
still lack experience. They are by
no means an inferior outfit, though,
and stand a fighting chance to con
quer the Bear Cubs. The frosh team
will be chosen from the following:
Graves, Hoelle, Roberts, Scheeline,
Hill, Brock, McAfee, and Knecht.
