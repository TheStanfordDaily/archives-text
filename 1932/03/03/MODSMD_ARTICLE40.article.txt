# SOPHOMORE CAGERS GIVE SENIORS FIRST DEFEAT OF SEASON
## 
### 
With the score 7 to 0 at the end
of the first quarter, the sophomore
women cagers started a determined
rally to administer the first defeat
of the season to the seniors by a
score of 14 to 11. This win ties the
freshmen and s'eniors for first place j
with one defeat each; it the |
sophomores in second place with
(wo defeats, and places the juniors !
third with four defeats.
Until this game the sophomore i
teamwork had been very ragged, I
and had failed to click in a most j
pronounced manner. Yesterday they i
went out to fight, and played one (
of the roughest games which has j
ever been played on the women's <
courts. Fouls were called continu
ally, especially on the sophomore ,
guards.
It must be said in defense of the
seniors that they showed the worst
form of the season, while the sopho
mores showed their best form.
