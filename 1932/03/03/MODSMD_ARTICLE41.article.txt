# Babe Trackmen Gun For Sacramento Tilt
## Redskins Powerful in Cinder Events, But Mediocre in Field; Places and Shows Needed for Win 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
The Stanford freshman track team i
1 opens a big day of sports for Indian
fans Saturday, when it meets the
strong Sacramento Junior College !
squad at 10:30 o'clock in the Old
! Oval.
| Biil Ellington is gunning for the
Capital City organization this ye;'.r,
i because last season they brought
j along Sacramento High, and the 15
: points scored by the latter team
proved just the victory margin of j
the combined teams over the year
lings.
Confident of Win
The "white hopes" of Stanford i
i track are confident of their ability i
| to upset Sacramento, and base this
! confidence on the brilliant early
season performances of A1 Black
man, Dave Devlin, Phil Morentin,
Frank Bowles, Russ Munro, and
Lloyd Schween.
Ali of these men are fairly sure
of either winning or placing high in
J Saturday's meet, but their combined
efforts cannot total more than 35
! points, leaving the rest of the team
| with the job of scoring the remain
| ing 25 or so points necessary to win.
Second- and third-place men will
! play a big part in the final outcomp
j of Saturday's meet.
Vincent Big Threat
Ward Vincent will prove a big i
I threat to Sacramento quarter-rnilers
j who have intentions of taking the
| 440, because the stocky Indian ath
! lete has been improving every time '
he runs, and should get close to 52
seconds Saturday. At the beginning
of autumn quarter Vincent was
running his 440's in about 56 sec
; onds, some twenty-five yards slow- j

j er than in his race against the All-
Stars last Saturday.
George Downing in the 880 is an
; other much-improved runner who
should score against the Sacramen
| tans. His best mark to date is 2:07.
While Dave Devlin rates as the
logical favorite in this race, Hal
Underhill and Walt Harris intend to
make the 880 a real sweep for the
Indians.
Places, Shows Needed
Phil Morentin is the odds-on man
in the mile grind. Bob Brown, who
ran such a good race in the inter
j class meet, will be lighting for a
i place.
Three men who are long shots in
the field events Saturday, but who
i may come through with much
needed points, are Lory Rothert in
the pole vault, John Beatty in the
javelin, and Herb Joslin in the dis
cus. Bowles and Peters, who tied
at 20 feet in the broad jump in the
last meet, are out for place "points
in Saturday's battle, and what they
do in this event may mean victory
or defeat in the yearlings' "grudge
battle" with Saeramento.
