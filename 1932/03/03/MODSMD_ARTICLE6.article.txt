# TRACK SEASON OPENS AGAINST OLYMPIC CLUB
## Stanford Meets Winged 'O' Without Services Of Star Vaulters 
### Dick Strouse 
Hoping to help Dink Templeton !
i along the road to physical recovery
' by starting the track season off with
j a victory, Stanford's 1932 cindermen
will meet the Olympic Club Satur
day afternoon at 2:30 on the old
I oval. The Indians will enter the j
j meet in a weakened condition be- \
cause of the absence of Captain Al- 1
,vin Hables, Bert DeGroot, Bill Mil- i
ler, Frank Lombaydi, Jimmy Will- !
| son, and Dan Murphy.
With Hables and Murphy out, the
burden in the 440 will be carried by j
the cable logs of Ben Eastman. East
man will probably run the relay, 1
J with Les Hables and two of a quar- j
tot including Fullenwider, Nash, '
Hundley, and Hay as his teammates.
These four made the best times in
| yesterday's trials.
Hables Out of 220
Giberson, Les Hables, and Case ;
j will represent Stanford in the 100,
I and the same trio minus Hables will :
I run the furlong. Lombardi will not [
i compete in either dash due to a |
i muscle cramp he received last Fri
! day.
| The two men—Miller and DeGroot
! —who threatened to give the Indians \
: a pair of 13-foot 6-inch pole vaulters j
| are on the shelf due to a pulled
j muscle and ineligibility respectively.
Johns and Van Dellen will be the
, only Cardinals entered in this event, |
while Austin, Jones, Don Blackman, |
1 Clyne, Messimer, and Jensen will
| high-jump.
Weights Strong
As any number of men can enter '
i the field events and the distances in i
the meet, Stanford should lake the :
first four places in the shot-put and J
discus, although only three count.
Jones, Laborde, Nellie Gray, George j
Grey, Lyman, and Robinson will i
throw the weights.
Sam Eastman, Ferric, and Atkin
son, who recorded the excellent j
time of 3:19 for three laps last Fri-
J day, will try and take Carter and
Hill of the Club in the 1760-yard
: sprint. Aebersold of last year's var- I
! sity, Kaehler, and Azevedo, Amdahl, j
j and Hininan of the class of '34's track
j team will chase each other around
j the track for approximately ten min- ,
i utes in the two-mile.
.
Packard, Stallings Out
Because Dave Packard and Dean |
' Stallings are not yet in the best of !
j condition, Coach Bill Ellington will i
! rely on Herbert, Meier, and Brug- j
| man in the low hurdles and Brug- j
man, Meier, and Woolley in the |
| highs. Werder, Butler, Williams, j
i Reppy, Willard, and anyone else who j
| wishes to enter will broad-jump.
I Headed by Naylon, the half-milers
i include Fullenwider, Burch, and de- >
: Bretteville. Al Ray, Dave Brown, !
! Kantzer, Dunn, Dawson, and Maino j
| will throw the javelin.
