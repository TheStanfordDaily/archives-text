PIPE SMOKERS!
COLONEL ADAMS
Founder of the blend
Is a MILD blend of
KENTUCKY BURLEY
SUN-CURED VIRGINIA
LOUISIANA PERIQUE
COLDEN TURKISH
& SYRIAN LATAKIA
Each of these tobaccos is
grown, and cured under dif
ferent conditions, and aged
from 4 to 5 years.
COLONEL ADAMS derives
j its flavor from these choice
tobaccos, and does not depend
on licorice, molasses, or other
! "dope."
That's why it smokes cool and
sweet to the bottom of your
pipe, without the soggincss or
j bite of unseasoned tobacco.
