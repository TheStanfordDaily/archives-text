# CARDS TACKLE OLYMPIC CLUB IN FIRST MEET
## National Track Luminaries Will Perform Under Winged 'O' Colors EASTMAN MAY BE OUT Sabin Carr-Bill Miller Pole Vault Duel Off 
### Dick Strouse 
Past, present, and future track
stars that may not yet be in the best
of condition, will oppose under
graduate zeal minus the services of
Ben Eastman when the Olympic
Club helps Stanford inaugurate the
current track season tomorrow af
ternoon.
Although nothing certain is
known, Eastman probably will be
kept out of the meet to protect a
cramped muscle that might, if
strained at this early date, prevent
him from entering the more import
ant meets later in the season.

In spite of the supposed experts'
opinion that the Winged "O" is rep
resented by one of its weakest teams
(his year, tomorrow's victory is not
ah'eady Stanford's. The Post Street
ers have acquired the services of
several more stars since their dis
appointing performance against
S.F.U., and an additional week of
practice will make considerable dif
ference in the squad's condition.
Carr to Vault
Chief among the new Olympians
is Sabin Carr, the famous Yale
pole-vaulter, who holds the inter
collegiate record. Carr will be aided
by Jack Wool, present A.A.U. cham
pion, and, in the absence of DeGroot
and Miller, they will meet Johns
and Van Do 11 en of Stanford.
Spud Mossman, California's 1931
track captain and co-holder of the
B;g Meet record in the two-mile

An unknown named Fred Walts
will face Stanford's equally notori
ous George Hay, Paul Nash, and
Roy Hundley in the 440 if Eastman
does not run.
Champion Milers
A veteran named Harry Carter,
who takes great delight in annually
beating Indian milers, will have as
a running mate Ralph Hill of Ore
gon, who once startled the track
world by defeating Kizer of Wash
ington in a 4:12 mile. Atkinson, Fer
ric, and Sam Eastman will handle
the program's opening race for the
Cards.
Warren Dixon and Jack Marklc,
who is credited with a mark 1:50,
will enter the 880 for the Club. Dick
Wright of last year's varsity may
also run, and if he does he will re
new his rivalry with Naylon and
Fullenwider.
Hurdles Close
Ex-Stanford Captain Podge Smith
and the great Charlie K;uster will
again face each other in the high
hurdles, only this time they will be
competing for the same team. A1

running for the Club instead of
Stanford, and they will offer Brug
man, Herbert, Meier, and Woolley
plenty of competition.
The broad-jump will find former ■
