Sane Kidnappers
The crime was committed by nor- i
I mal, sane people, not exhibitionists <
i or lunatics, in the opinion of Miles.
| "If the kidnappers were publicity- !
I seekers, they would not be the type j
which cover tracks carefully. Faulty j
j technique is usually proof of the ec- j
| centric. The odd or insane person !
j would not have carried out the crime j
| in such a business-like, straightfor- ,
ward manner."
The Lindbergh abductors did
; nothing unnecessary and carried out
, the job neatly, Miles pointed out. j
■ An exhibitionist would try to draw
attention to himself by doing some
: thing unique or peculiar, and would
give himself away by sloppy method
I and inattention to details. Loeb and
; Leopold were unusual cases, being ;
| both thrill-seekers and thorough '
I workers.
Careful Plans
In forbidding the Lindberghs to
I reveal the contents of the ransom
j note, the kidnappers proved again !
j that they were not eccentric, but
quite sane. Miles said. If the note j
was published, the ego of the crim- ;
inals would be fed. but their scheme
might be ruined by the many per- 1
j sons who would try to be on hand
j at the ransom-place.
