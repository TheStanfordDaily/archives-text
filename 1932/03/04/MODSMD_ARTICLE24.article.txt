### 
1 welve fraternities and twenty-two freshmen were listed on (lie books
of the Intcrfraternity Board of Control for violation of the rushing rules,
as the Board went into action last night al the beginning of the annual
intcrfraternity farce.
I |> to a late hour freslunen were still being taken individually before
the Board and it appeared that no decision would be reached last night.
First, the representatives of the reported fraternities were called to the
meeting in the Old Union and three of the houses taken in separately
before the Board.

As nothing was gained from Ihe
(fraternity men, the freshmen were
'dragged from their beds and books
to appear. The fraternity men, loi —
! tering in the lobby of the Union,
; were dismissed, to be called back
when wanted. However, as there
was still a large number of fresh
-1 j men waiting to go on the carpet as
| the Daily went to press, it did not
i appear as though the fraternities
would be called before today.
As the freshmen told their stor
ies, more and more houses were
dragged into the mess until it looks
as though few, if any, of the 24 fra
jternities will escape. The Board did
( not signify what penalty will be
meted out to the offenders except
j the assurance that punishment will
: follow all convictions.
j Typical of the reticence of the
; j fraternities to give any information
was the remark of one Greek upon
leaving the room where the Board
I was in session. "All they did was
ask me about an illegal rushing
party about which neither myself
j nor any member of my house knew
| anything."
The members of the Board who
are sitting in judgment upon the
I fraternities are Warren Biggs, chair

! Johnny Deuel, Wally Butler, Ward
