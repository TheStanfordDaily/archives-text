# RANK DISCRIMINATION
## 
### 
Once again the Masque Rail will he one of Ihe hiiÂ»hlights
ol spring social season. Alter being shelved tor a year, the
Rail, sponsored by Ihe Rally Committee, will serve as a set
ting for the climax of the one election on this campus in
which anv interest is taken, the choosing of a King of Ihe
Rail.
Of equal interest is the question of what fair feminine
figure will occupy the throne beside Ihe king. Although
there lias never been any law stating that the queen must
be a campus woman, heretofore she has always been a
Stanford co-ed. This year a rule has been laid down that
Ihe queen must hail from either Stanford or Mills. This is
rank discrimination and a direct slight against other schools
and districts where equally attractive women might be
found to rule the campus for a night.
Is Mills a Mecca toward which all roughs turn when the
yen for feminine companionship strikes them? Is all the
womanly pulchritude and charm of the bay district con
centrated in those few acres of Oakland? No, a thousand
times, No. At California and Ihe various junior colleges at
San Mateo, San .lose and elsewhere and even in the com
munities are many girls who could fittingly preside as queen
over the Stanford rough.
The Stanford women, admitting that perhaps there is
not, among their number, one qualified to till that post of
honor, scream in protest at the unfair action of the Rally
Committee in ruling that the Queen must come from Mills,
the other possibility being almost automatically eliminated.
The men, too, should not stand quietly by and lei this
outrageous favoritism be run over them. Rise up and
squawk for your rights, roughs. The home town girl and
co-eds from other schools should be placed on the same
social par as Mills.
