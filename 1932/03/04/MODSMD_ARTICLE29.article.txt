# "HI HI, COME ON OVER..."

### 
The Pavilion "will be transformed into a miniature Co
ney Island tonight on the occasion of Stanford's second
annual carniva 1.
Through the general uproar of realistic circus atmos
phere will sound raucous cries of ballvhooers, advertising
their wares with "hi hi, come on ov-a-a-ahh; play bing-go
bing-go; some-body wins, cv-ah-ry time."
Some will exhort roughs to hear their fortunes from the.
lips of beautiful and mysterious women. Others will offer
lesls of strength and skill, with ample rewards for the
ablest. Each will ask as a fee the paltry sum of one thin
dime, but a tenth of a dollar.
The fun will be there, just as if was at last year's affair.
Rut tonight's festival will hold more than a rousing good
time for all. Every dime laid on the line will go for a
worthy cause, into the coffers of the student emergency
fund committee.
A.W'.S. is expending tremendous effort into putting on
the show. Vet il is giving up the fruits of this work, regu
larly utilized to help pay for the women's gvni. The Roard
of Athletic Control is offering use of the Pavilion al cost;
the Mothers" Club, Roble Club, and the sororities are con
tributing home-made candy; and the corporation yard itf
donating equipment.
Think twice before you wander off-campus on a dale
tonight. Rv dropping into the Pavilion and scattering a few
dimes far less than you would spend elsewhere you can
enjoy that self-satisfying "I have helped ' feeling and with
il a wagon load of fun.
