# BULL SESSION
## WHY NOT ELECT THE QUEEN? 
### 
j Under the altruistic ruse of help
! ing the Convalescent Home, Stan
ford is lo have another Masque Ball.
But ruse or no ruse, the affair is
enjoyable—even if the proceeds for
charity be hopelessly small. In fact,
j when last year the Ex Committee
j banned the Ball for fear it might
Igo into the red, the Bull Session
j still favored the annual affair—not
j as a charitable gesture but simply
as another good time for the stu
dent body. But, because people
would rather appear charitable than
pleasure-seeking, the Ball will again
be presented as a "charity" affair.
One of the pleasant appendages to
the Ball has been the election of a
"King"—wilh votes at one cent each;
| the election proceeds going to the
' Home. Assuming the major purpose
j of the election to be financial, may
, it be suggested that greater funds
j could be raised by electing a queen
j and allowing her to select her
; "King." It would be highly profit
j able to have each sorority and Roble
| name a candidate and then let the
dear sisters get out and fight for
their nominee.
Men's living groups care very
! little whether or not "their" man
I gets the kingship—but with .sorori
| ties, the situation would be alto-
I gether different. The women rate
i themselves according to the men's
j estimation of them; and they would
j stamp up and down the Quad hour

. after hour lounding in any stray!
i coins from masculine pockets to in
j suit; the popularity of their own ,
I group. If the contest for the king's j
j position was a race, then the elec- |
! lion for the Queenship would be a |
! veritable holocaust of marauding i
S and desperate women —fighting for
i the glory of the group.
Women's rushing has not been j
i history very long. There are still
■ some cheerful rivalries hanging over j
I from that period which might add '
; zest and spice to the contest. And
• as far as digging money from un
willing pockets, who will compare
some fair young thing in a summer
! frock and a spring-quarter stare
j with a half-interested rough. Of j
course, for thinking up this idea, I
,am automatically barred from the |
> fun of shelling out to the friendly
| creatures that will be out working
! for their candidate.
Then, too, this is Leap Year, and j
i what would be more appropriate I
I than have the Queen choose her!
I royal partner. When a man selects '
1 a woman, that isn't news, for our >
| society is built up on the fiction of ;
! the coy young miss waiting lor her
; knight. But when a woman chooses j
j a man, that will make interest. ;
i Let's elect a queen. It will be ad- j
' vantageous financially. It will make j
: voting more enjoyable. And it will !
I add life to a spring quarter.

j Under the altruistic ruse of help

ford is lo have another Masque Ball.
But ruse or no ruse, the affair is
enjoyable—even if the proceeds for
charity be hopelessly small. In fact,
j when last year the Ex Committee
j banned the Ball for fear it might
Igo into the red, the Bull Session
j still favored the annual affair—not
j as a charitable gesture but simply
as another good time for the stu
dent body. But, because people
would rather appear charitable than
pleasure-seeking, the Ball will again
be presented as a "charity" affair.
One of the pleasant appendages to
the Ball has been the election of a
"King"—wilh votes at one cent each;
| the election proceeds going to the
' Home. Assuming the major purpose
j of the election to be financial, may
, it be suggested that greater funds
j could be raised by electing a queen
j and allowing her to select her
; "King." It would be highly profit
j able to have each sorority and Roble
| name a candidate and then let the
dear sisters get out and fight for
their nominee.
