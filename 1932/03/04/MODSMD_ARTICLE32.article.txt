MATA HARI—At the New Stanford [
Theatre.
Garbo is more glamorous, more j
beautiful, more exotic than ever, j
Those strange creatures who are
heard at every Garbo picture to j
wonder what people see in her—will
surely find a reply to their question |
in Mata Hari.
Mata is a spy in the World War i
who whirls alluringly through a '
series of daring intrigues and ad
ventures and ends nobly facing a
French firing squad at sunrise.
Ramon Novarro is the young of- !
ficer for whom she risks all. Al- (
though he is co-starred with Garbo, j
we have our doubts as to the exact ;
equality of the equation.
Lionel Barrymore and Lewis!
Stone shine in a splendid support- j
ing cast. And now, with one added '
remark about fantastic gowns—if j
you are not spurred to see the pic- 1
ture—you've already seen it.

THE SVVORI) IN THE POOI By
Dwight Marfield. E. P. Dutton &
Company. 19.'52. (At the Palo Alt*)
Book Shop.)
We have just finished about the ,
first detective story we've read since 1
Sherlock Holmes. We shied clear i
for a long time because we have |

| known people who write detective
1 stories and we are wise, having
1 learned that a good detective story
' consists in the casting of suspicion
on one, two, or more innocent per- |
sons for some 200 pages, usually.
1 Various misleading minor interests j
are tangled in the web of the plot, j
! meanwhile. In the final chapter each
j hair, thread, and finger-print is j
| satisfactorily explained in a mini
mum of space—"quite simple, my |
dear Watson." Practically ail stories
of this nature are conducted ac- j
cording to rule. We, therefore, se- '
; lected the fancy-sounding title,
I ''The Sword in the Pool," and hoped j
i for some fanciful spice along with ;
:the ratiocinative breakfast food. We
igot it.
Connie Van Amster, young, beau- i
! tiful, and amazingly wealthy, is the
J last of the Van Amsters. The only
! thing that mars her luxurious, pent
: house life is the provision in her j
aunt's will stating that she shall
spend her fortune in New York j
City. And there's the plot. (1.
Sharpers are immediately after the I
! money; 2. Was that restriction in the I
will authentic?) All the rest of the;
story is delightful. Arabian nights, j
i This description of gorgeous things i
! and glamorous people easily stands I
1 alone. The artificial detective theme 1
!is quite unnecessary. —E.T.P.
