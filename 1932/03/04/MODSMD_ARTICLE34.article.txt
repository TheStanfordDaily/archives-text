The Editor, Sir:
For the Carnival tonight the com
mittee needed many props which, if
we had to pay for the materials and
labor that went into them, would
have cut a large hole in our antici
pated profits. Mr. Riechers, the head
carpenter, and his staff put in many
hours nf over-time work building
basketball back stops, horses for ihe
nail pounding concession, hunting up
weird sizes and types of boards, and
doing innumerable other odd jobs.
Mr. Button and Mr. Shroder will
ingly offered the services ol a truck
and driver to transport the heavy
articles to the Pavilion. Wn should
like to take this opportunity to thank
them sincerely and to make known
to the campus that the success of
th*j Carnival is in a large part due
to the efficient co-operation of the
men of the Corporation Yard:.
JANE SNYDER,
MARGARET ABRAMS.
