Ay dear Dink,
Remember you said last Novem
jor that the Big Game left you
■old? Well, here's something that
nay warm you up a bit.
A glance through Mr. Spalding's
mnual track guide shows that they
dn't done right by our Ben, and
omething ought to be done about
t. I\ feature of the book is the
11KJ1 Collegiate Honor Roll,' and
:s might bo expected, Stanford
larnes clutter up ihe pages quite
bit.
Dyer is fifth in the 220-yard dash
ist for his 21.3 in the Southern
California meet; Eastman is tied for
irst in the 440 with Williams of
J.S.C. with his 47.4 mark in the
California Intercollegiates; DeGroot
s mentioned for his 13 ft. (j in. mark
■i the pole vault; the feats of Nellie
I ray, George Grey, and Laborde in
lie shot and those of Jones, La
iorde, and McLeod in the discus
re given full recognition; and of
our.se the new world mark hung
ip by the relay team at Fresno
cads the mile relay list.
Hut horrors! Look closely at
the 880-yard run, and notice
that one B. B. Eastman is listed
as fourth with a mark of 1:51.4,
made in the IX'. A. A. A. A. meet.
Now if that is our Ben Bangs,
and it must be because he is
listed from Stanford, why the
heck isn't he at the head of the
list? Didn't he check in at the
finish of the 830 in the P.A.A.
meet in San Francisco in 1:53
Hat?
And then he is gyped in the ''Best
lecords Made By American College
/[en" group, his 47.4 mark being
verlooked, although Meredith, Dis~
lond, and Williams are listed for
he same record.
Nor is Eastman the only one to
et his due. Podge Smith broke the
ipe in 23.5 seconds for a new Big
fleet record in the 220-yard low
urdles, as you of course remem
er, but nary a mention is there
lade of it. The best mark of the
ear was made by Ernie Payne cf
louthern California, 23.4 seconds,
/it 1 i Jack Keller of Ohio State listed ;
s second with a mark the same as
rnith's.
As Jack Jernegan remarked, I
Such a business!" Well, maybe
!en will get sore enough about the
roposition to run that 47.4 thing
lto the ground in the Olympic Club
icet tomorrow—or at least some
ime before the season is over.
By the way, Dink, you may have
ri argumeM. c-n your hands with
!ddie Twigg< ; , the golf pro. He was
emoaning the fact the other day
hat Charlie Seaver is kept busy
laying everything but golf, while
erry Trautnian spends most of his
ime shagging balls around third
ase for Hurry Wolter.
Wait till the unfortunate Mr.
Twiggs hears about Herman
Ht'llni;in—he checked in his put
ter Wednesday ni'>ht in favor of
a pair of spikes, and high
jumped a mere 5 feet 11 inches
for Bil! Ellington. Just wait till
Mr. Twiggs hears that—and that
Iloiman is thinking about going
in for track in a hig way.
We're all going out tomorrow to
ee the track season officailly
pened, but somehow it won't seem
ery "official" to most of us. "Dink
'empleton" and "Stanford track"
ave been synonymous for so long,
's going to be a pretty hollow af
ur, with the "boy coach" not
mong those present. But we're
ooting for you to be back before
le season gets very far along.
One thing more, Dink. Collier
lonnell wants to know whether you
itck 'em in, or wear 'em out.
As ever,
Lowell Cox
