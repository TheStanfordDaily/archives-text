# Indian, U.C. Swimmers Splash Here Tomorrow
## FARM ARTISTS VS. BEAR MERMEN IN BIG AQUATIC FRAY Card Swimmers Seek New Intercollegiate Marks In Annual Meet 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
When the local pools resound to
the splash of Stanford-California
swimmers tomorrow afternoon at 1
o'clock, Stanford will see the great
est exhibition of water sports of the
entire campus year.
Pacific Coast records galore will
have to take a pretty severe beat
j ing when the four-man relay team
; of John McKelvey, Captain Fi'ank
i Booth, Ted Wiget, and Tuppy
! Gardner enter the pools in that
order in search of a new national
intercollegiate 400-yard mark.
Out For Kccord
Then again, when McKelvey, after
some thirteen minutes' rest lias re
vinced him, slips into the pool for
his 50-yard national intercollegiate
j mark attempt, an anxious crowd
| will watch him churn his way for
1 20 odd seconds.
Gardner, Captain Booth, Wiget,
I Austin Clapp, and Bob Clark are
! all among the record-seekers, with
! the century, 220, and 440 free-style,
j and the 200-yard breaststroke events
I the particular objects of their ef
! forts.
' Fred Tebbetts is off the crutches
i after suffering from a strained liga
! ment, and will be ready to compete
iin the backstroke. California's
Rucker, in the diving, will offer
j plenty of class in this event. He is
| expected to take the honors away
! from Campbell and Wardwell, who
j will represent the Indians in place
'of Herb Marsh.
Bcnct Good
Freshmen are planning a spec- ,
I tacular afternoon of it, as well. Jim 1
> Benet in the breaststroke, and Bill ]
I Rogers in the backstroke, both are
j bent on finishing ahead of the Cali
i fornia-Stanford freshman record, :
' and the relay team of Cook, Tara
i nik, Triolo, and Boothe is going to
; waste no time in its aqueous sur- !
; roundings.
Water polo is about a stand-off i
for the varsity, with Ihe yearlings I
expected to hang on to their un
broken season record. The babes I
have run up G9 goals to their com- '
| bined opponents' 11 this year, and
j intend to keep up their average. ;
The Blue and Gold varsity, how- '
i ever, boasts the brother of George
i Mitchell, captain of the 1928 Olym- j
pic Games team and present Olym
' pic Club guard, which is no small
i argument for their side. *
Want New Marks
Officials of the meet are in hopes
lof obtaining Henry Ingwersen,
; swimming commissioner of the Pa
' cific Association, to authenticate any
j new records that happen to issue
forth. If Ingwersen is unavailable, j
'some official v/ill be secured in any
event, and will be supplied with
plenty of good stop watches.
I One o'clock is the time set for the
opening record attempt in the 400-
j yard relay, the varsity and fresh
man events following alternately.
; After this will come both water
polo games. Admission with student
body cards will be twenty-five
; cents, and fifty cents will admit the
i general public.

Want New Marks
Officials of the meet are in hopes
lof obtaining Henry Ingwersen,
; swimming commissioner of the Pa
' cific Association, to authenticate any
j new records that happen to issue
forth. If Ingwersen is unavailable, j
'some official v/ill be secured in any
event, and will be supplied with
plenty of good stop watches.
I One o'clock is the time set for the
opening record attempt in the 400-
j yard relay, the varsity and fresh
man events following alternately.
; After this will come both water
polo games. Admission with student
body cards will be twenty-five
; cents, and fifty cents will admit the
i general public.
When the local pools resound to
the splash of Stanford-California
swimmers tomorrow afternoon at 1
o'clock, Stanford will see the great
est exhibition of water sports of the
entire campus year.
Pacific Coast records galore will
have to take a pretty severe beat
j ing when the four-man relay team
; of John McKelvey, Captain Fi'ank
i Booth, Ted Wiget, and Tuppy
! Gardner enter the pools in that
order in search of a new national
intercollegiate 400-yard mark.
Out For Kccord
Then again, when McKelvey, after
some thirteen minutes' rest lias re
vinced him, slips into the pool for
his 50-yard national intercollegiate
j mark attempt, an anxious crowd
| will watch him churn his way for
1 20 odd seconds.
Gardner, Captain Booth, Wiget,
I Austin Clapp, and Bob Clark are
! all among the record-seekers, with
! the century, 220, and 440 free-style,
j and the 200-yard breaststroke events
I the particular objects of their ef
! forts.
' Fred Tebbetts is off the crutches
i after suffering from a strained liga
! ment, and will be ready to compete
iin the backstroke. California's
Rucker, in the diving, will offer
j plenty of class in this event. He is
| expected to take the honors away
! from Campbell and Wardwell, who
j will represent the Indians in place
'of Herb Marsh.
Bcnct Good
Freshmen are planning a spec- ,
I tacular afternoon of it, as well. Jim 1

I Rogers in the backstroke, both are
j bent on finishing ahead of the Cali
i fornia-Stanford freshman record, :
' and the relay team of Cook, Tara

; waste no time in its aqueous sur- !
; roundings.
Water polo is about a stand-off i
for the varsity, with Ihe yearlings I
expected to hang on to their un
broken season record. The babes I
have run up G9 goals to their com- '
