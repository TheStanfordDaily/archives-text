### 
JI OPEWELL, N.J.. March 4. (/P) —A promising clue to the kidnapers of
Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., developed early today upon the disclosure
that a third ransom letter had been received by Col. Lindbergh.
The note's contents were kept as secret as those of the note left pinned
on the window-sill by the baby's abductors, but it was revealed that
the writing of the two letters was similar.

Unsigned, the note was contained
in a plain envelope addressed to
Colonel Lindbergh at Hopewell. It
tonight was being compared by
I Government handwriting experts
i with the ransom message left in the
j Lindbergh nursery.
A new figure entered the case
! when detectives brought in a for-
J mer nurse who had been discharged
| by the Lindberghs. Police refused
| to reveal her name, but questioned
! her at length.
| They also questioned for the sec
i ond time the 23-year-old Scotch
I girl, Betty Gow, who has been the
i baby's nurse for the last year. It
! was she who put Charles Junior to
| bed and her screams alarmed the
j household when she found him gone
I three hours later.
Out of the scores of others who
■ were brought before the police to
i day, four men were held at the
temporary police headquarters on
; the Lindbergh estate for a more
| thorough grilling. Their names also
were not given out.
