# CARD GOLFERS TO INVADE U.C. TODAY
## Stanford Players Favored To Win Over Bears 
### 
Entering the match as heavy fa
j vorites, the varsity and freshman
j golfers invade Berkeley today in
| their first intercollegiate match of
| the season.
On the basis of past performances
!of individual members of both
| teams, the Card club-swingers
! should have an easy time in down
-1 ing the Bears. The men will be
j somewhat handicapped by unfamil
! iarity with the Castlewood course
jat Berkeley, but even with this
| point against them, there is little
i possibility of an upset.
After a practice round yesterday
i afternoon on the Castlewood links,
| Coach E. M. Twiggs announced a
i partial line-up for the double and
! single events. In the varsity single
! matches, Seaver, Eichelberger, Hell
i man, Hawley, and Hoag are prob
j ably cinched to be 011 the team. The
| player for the sixth position will not
be decided upon until just prior to
I the matches. Either Dwyer, Brown,
: or Thompson may get the call. Ed
j wards and Trautman will probably
; replace some of these men for the
I doubles.
Prospects for a freshman win are
! not quite so bright as for the var
jsity, but Coach Twiggs believes that
the team as a whole stacks up pretty
| well with the California yearlings,
j The Indian babes are conceded an
1 even chance in the matqhes. The
I probable lineup will include
j Graves, Hoelle, Roberts, Scheeline,
j Kill, and McAfee. Brock and Knecht
J may play in the doubles in place
of some of the above men.
