# BABE TRACKSTERS MEET STRONG FOE IN JAYSEE SQUAD
## Sacramento, Thirty Strong, Out To Repeat Last Year's Victory 
### 
By Albert Guerard
Bill Ellington's freshman track j
team swings into action for the sec- 1
ond time this season tomorrow |
I morning, when it meets a veteran j
I Sacramento Junior College squad at j
| 10:30 in the old oval. The Sacra- !
mentans are bringing 30 athletes to j
I the Farm, including 8 men who last !
year scored 35 of the points which j
helped Sacramento to win over the j
1931 yearlings, GB-53.
A1 Blackmail should get his first j
real competition of the year when |
I he faces Wells of Sacramento in the j
j 109 and 220. Al's best times to date j
j have been 10 flat and 21:4, while |
| Wells' best marks, made last year, j
were 9.9 and 21.9. Patterson and j
Slivich, two men who made sprint- }
ing history while at Sacramento i
High School are fully capable of de- !
! feating Blackmail and Wells, how- ;
j ever.
Sims vs. Vincent
Sims of Sacramento and Ward j
. Vincent of the frosh are likely to j
I turn in the most thrilling race of I
; the meet in the 440. Both men have j
i done under 53 seconds and may get t
| down to 52 fiat tomorrow.
The 880 looks like another real j
! battle with Dave Devlin given a!
■ slight edge over Causbrook of Sac- j
j ramento, whose best mark to date I
lis 2:05.4. George Downing has a !
' good chance of adding the odd point I
j to the Indian total. Winn of Sacra- I
i mento, who has done 4:38.9, and i
j Phil Morentin, with a season record j
! of 4:40, tangle in the mile run.
Strong Hurdlers
j Johnny Wood, former N.C.S. bur- j
j die champion, is running the hur- j
| dies for Sacramento, as is Bennett, I
i a letterman, and Harvey. Frankie j
i Bowles, Tom Sales, Andy Bright, !
j Robert Buffum, Russ Munro, and |
: Aylett Cotton are the Stanford j
, timber-topping artists.
Runkala in the pole vault and !
: Otto Reemts in. the high-jump are ;
I Sacramento's biggest bids for vie- j
! tories in the field events. Runkala i
I will face Lory Rothert, while !
| Reemts may have to content him- j
! self with a second place when he 1
: meets Lloyd Schween, the star In- ,
I dian jumper. ]
New Spear-Tosser
How the points in the broad- j
; jump, shot-put, discus, and javelin j
, are distributed will probably decide j
the meet. A new javelin star turned j
out for the yearling team last night j
; in Joe Butte, who starred on Vance j
Fawcett's frosh cage squad. The big j
I guard seems capable of throwing j
; the spear well over 150 feet, and j
; should give John Beatty of the In- '
1 dians and Sims of Sacramento some !
] real competition in this event.

; in Joe Butte, who starred on Vance j
