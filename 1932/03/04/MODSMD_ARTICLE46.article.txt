# Frosh Nine Out Slump To Play Roosevelt High
## 
### 
Battered by the repeated bat
wielding of prep school ball clubs,
but none the worse off for their
defeats, the Stanford freshman out
fit plays the Roosevelt High School
nine of Oakland at 10 o'clock to- i
morrow morning on the old varsity
diamond in the. sixth game of the
season.
Since the game last Tuesday with
the Sequoia team, the frosh have a
decidedly improved style of play.
More polished and more consistent
than the brand of ball that the |
yearlings were handing out for j
awhile, the fielding and batting of j
the past few days strengthen the j
belief that one of these days the i
frosh are going to overcome this j
hoodoo that the prep school ball j
clubs hang over the babes when- j
ever a game comes along.
Frosh Improve
The frosh seem to have emerged j
from their tantrum of careless play- j
ing, and should play a stronger, j
more impressive game tomorrow. j
The playing personnel has brought j
forth some leal ball players. Com- |
ing out of a slump that detracted |
from his usual good game, Jim
Woolley, second-baseman, has lam- j
basted the ball all over the lot the
last few days. In a recent game with j
ihe varsity reserves, Woolley con- :
nected for two tripies and a single j
for three times at bat. Gordy Mai- !
latratt is another dread to opposing I
pitchers and fielders. He usually
hits two bingles in every three times j
at bat and he holds down the first j
sack in good style.
Regular Nine
For tomorrow's game Coach Mur- !
ray Cudcleback will probably start j
the nine that played in last Tues- ;
day's fracas. A1 Semmelroth will '
take the mound during the absence j
of Fred Heringer, regular frosh
pitcher. Charlie Emerick will catch, i
Gordy Mallatratt will cover first, j
while Jim Woolley will tend the j
keystone bag and Jim Kurtz will j
play at short. Completing the in- ;
field display, "Pepper" Boyd will j
fill third. The outfield will be can
vassed by Vincent Meyer, Jack!
Hosmer, and Pat Symonds.

The frosh seem to have emerged j
from their tantrum of careless play- j
ing, and should play a stronger, j
more impressive game tomorrow. j
The playing personnel has brought j
forth some leal ball players. Com- |
ing out of a slump that detracted |
from his usual good game, Jim
Woolley, second-baseman, has lam- j
basted the ball all over the lot the
last few days. In a recent game with j
ihe varsity reserves, Woolley con- :
nected for two tripies and a single j
for three times at bat. Gordy Mai- !
latratt is another dread to opposing I
pitchers and fielders. He usually
hits two bingles in every three times j
at bat and he holds down the first j
sack in good style.
Regular Nine
For tomorrow's game Coach Mur- !
ray Cudcleback will probably start j
the nine that played in last Tues- ;
day's fracas. A1 Semmelroth will '
take the mound during the absence j
of Fred Heringer, regular frosh
pitcher. Charlie Emerick will catch, i
Gordy Mallatratt will cover first, j
while Jim Woolley will tend the j
keystone bag and Jim Kurtz will j
play at short. Completing the in- ;
field display, "Pepper" Boyd will j
fill third. The outfield will be can
vassed by Vincent Meyer, Jack!
Hosmer, and Pat Symonds.
