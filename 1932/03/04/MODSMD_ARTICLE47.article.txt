# Moraga Nine Offers Chance For Pennant
## Deciding Game of Series Scheduled for Tomorrow; Broncos Clinch Race with California 
### BOB WADE 
ITII their chances for the conference pennant hanging in the balance,
for the first of what will probably be many times, Stanford's varsity
baseball team tomorrow goes to Moraga for the third and deciding game
of the St. Mary's series. Already having dropped two of the five games
played, and with the chances for at least one defeat on the Southern trip
highly probable, the Kcdshirts can hardly afford to lose another before
their departure after examinations.
Over in the Santa Clara baseball lot, where Walter "The Great" Mails
gives the boys pointers on the national pastime, all is rejoicing and cele
bration. Yesterday, the Broncos gave the Bears their second straight
drubbing of the rear, thus cinching their annual series, which, added to

their victory over the Indians, puts
them in a tie for third place with
their Farm rivals.
Dons Lose
U.S.F. returns from its rather dis
-1 astrous Southern invasion bent on
trimming the Golflen Bears in what
will be the Dons' first Bay region
appearance. California is at present
1 far from its usual place on the con
ference ladder, and a win over the
Dons would take a little of the salt I
out of the hoof-marks left by the j
Broncs from Santa Clara.
Down at U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. the \
boys are feeling that the season has I
started off in correct form with both j
1 teams taking a brace of games from i
the Dons of U.S.F. It remains to be
' seen if they will feel as happy when ■
they have each crossed bats with
Santa Clara this next week.
I
Anderson starts
With anything but pleasant mem- I
ories from the last game played on I
, the Gaels' field, when they nosed i
i out the Cards in an 11-inning strug- '
j gle that was almost finished under j
i the moon, Coach Harry Wolter will
! start Stan Anderson on the mound
| in an attempt to keep the faltering j
I Indians in the race. Anderson is j
| leading the Stanford hurlers, with !
■ a record of two victories and no de- i
| feats. If he can win the set-to to
| morrow, he will probably pitch the
I first U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. games.
Last year the Cards lost the sec-
I ond game of each series. This time j
| they expect to do their sleeping at
j night and play ball during the game, i
| Coach Wolter seeming at last to j
j have convinced the greater majority
i that one pitcher cannot win an en
j tire game by himself.
