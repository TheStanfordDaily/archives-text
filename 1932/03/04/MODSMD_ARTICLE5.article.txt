# Farm Concert Huge Success
## 
### Harry McMasters 
Elena Hitchcock, solo pianist fea- !
tured in the concert of the Stan- i
ford Symphony Orchestra last night.!
displayed remarkable technique in ,
playing a very difficult piece, i
Grieg's "Concerto in A Minor." Her '
handling of runs and especially of!
the passionate Viking rhythms of j
the last movement was excellent, i
Thunderous applause greeted her as j
the last crashing chord rolled out. J
With one or two exceptions the |
entire program was very well exe- j
cuted. Grieg's two beautiful elegiac j
melodies, "Heartswounds" and "Last j
Spring," and the second movement j
of "Caucasian Sketches," the village i
sounds, and the march of the vil- I
lagers to the mosque, were beauti- j
fully portrayed with the softly |
played woodwinds, violins, and!
horns answering each other. But a |
poorly played solo French horn I
marred the first movement, "In the I
Mountains."
Mrs. Marguerite MacManus con- !
ducted the orchestra.
