# BEARS, WASHINGTON TO FIGHT OUT COAST HOOP CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
BERKELEY, March 3 â€” For the
fourth time in the past ten years,
the University of California and
Washington basketball teams will
meet tomorrow night to determine
the championship of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
"Dark horse" winners in their re
spective divisions, the Golden Bears
and Huskies meet tomorrow, Satur
day, and, if necessary, Monday nights
at Oakland Auditorium. Although
the championship is the chief point
at issue, Bears and Huskies have
met on the hardwood often enough
in the past to have established a
keen rivalry.
IA the coming series the North
erners will be defending their 1931
title, won at Seattle at the expense
of the Bears. Led by a formidable
scorer in Chief Ralph Cairney, a
guard who has netted 128 points this
season, the Huskies are a fast-break
ing, colorful outfit. Coach Price and
his Bears have reason to remember
Cairney and his running-mate, Ned
Nelson, who checked the California
attack in two of the three cham
pionship games played last year at
Seattle.
Regular lineups for both teams
are expected to take the floor when
hostilities open at 8 o'clock.
