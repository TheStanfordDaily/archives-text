# GLEDHILL WILL NOT COMPETE; CARDS IN BURLINGAME MATCH
## 
### 
Captain Keith Gledhill will be un
able to accompany his teammates
to the Burlingame Tennis Club to
morrow afternoon, where a match
will be held with the clubmen at
1:30 o'clock.
Joe Coughlin, Chuck Otis, Chuck
Weesner, Bob Forbes, Jack Cos
grove, and Dan Ellis will uphold the
Indian end of the courts, with the
first five probably handling singles.
According to Coach Sherman Lock
wood, the affair has not yet been
definitely worked out, but the
matches will probably be mostly
doubles encounters.
Burlingame's two stars are Laurie
Driscoll, at present in the Stanford
law school and former varsity net
man, and Merv Griffin. Griffin is
the brother of Peck Griffin, national
doubles champion with "Little Bill
Johnston." Coughlin will probably
tackle Driscoll and Otis will face
Griffin, or vice versa.
