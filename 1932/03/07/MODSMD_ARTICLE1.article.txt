# LINDY ENLISTS GANG CHIEFS IN HUNT FOR BABY
## Declares Willingness To Meet Demands For Return Of Child STATEMENT AMBIGUOUS' Suitor Of Nurse Held For New Questioning 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., March (>. (/Piâ€”
The Lindberghs established an un
derworld contact today in the search
for their kidnaped baby, but what :
led to this step and what results, if |
any, it had achieved were as much
a mystery as the whereabouts of the
famous infant.
In a public statement last mid-"!
night Col. Charles A. Lindbergh and
Mrs. Lindbergh designated Salva- i
tore (Salvy) Spitale and Irving Bitz
of New "York, his reputed hench-!
man, as their "go-betweens" in the
hope the kidnapers would carry on !
negotiations for the return of the J
child.
Meantime, a new puzzle developed i
from an announcement at Hartford, j
Conn., that Henry (Red) Johnson, -
sailor suitor of Betty Gow, the j
stolen baby's nurse, had been de- !
livered to Englewood, N.J., police '
last night, and that New Jersey au
thorities had been given all infor- '
mat ion gained in examination of
Johnson.
Englewood police, however, de
nied they had Johnson. Later it was
learned Johnson was being held at
Newark police headquarters for fur
ther questioning.
The Lindbergh statement, couched
in seemingly ambiguous language,
whs subject to a variety of interpre
tations.
It said:
"If the kidnapers of our child are
unwilling to deal direct, we fully
authorize 'Salvy' Spitale and Irving
Bitz to act as our go-betweens. We
will also follow any other method
suggested by the kidnapers that we
can be sure will bring the return of
our child.
"Charles A. Lindbergh.
"Anne Lindbergh."
