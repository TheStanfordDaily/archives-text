# W.A.A. CARNIVAL WELL ATTENDED
## Concessions And Skit Prove Popular With Roughs 
### 
| Providing a fitting climax to this
I quarter's social season, the second
j W.A.A. Carnival was held in the
Pavilion on Friday night. The
crowds began to arrive shortly after
8 o'clock, and many stayed until 1
o'clock, the closing hour. The danc
ing, to the music of Bob Thornton's
orchestra, was one of the biggest
attractions of the evening.
Concessions were the best money
earners, with the light-globe break
ing the most popular, and the nail
| pounding a close second. The fac
j ulty skit was presented four times to
j enthusiastic audiences and brought
I good returns. The Mystery Maze,
j the silhouette machine, and the
! caricatures, were also popular.
I The total profits of the evening
J are not yet known, but it is believed
J that they will mean a substantial
! addition to the Students' Emergency
j Employment Fund.
