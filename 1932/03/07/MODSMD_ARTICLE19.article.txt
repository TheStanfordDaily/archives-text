# Founders' Day Reminds Old Coachman Of Past
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
As Founders' Day draws around
once again, Charlie Wooster, Sena
tor Stanford's coachman for 25 years,
| sits, aged and rheumatic but still
J mentally alert, and ponders on the
j day the University was dedicated.
When asked if he attended the
j exercises Wooster replied:
"Oh, I drove the Governor and
i Major Schofield up to the Quad;
j then I had to watch the bosses."
Serving the Stanfords while they
! lived, Wooster later became care
! taker of their tomb. He was pen
sioned off in 1925 at the age of 80.
! Well preserved today, his coach
man's eyes are still sharp and his
! memory excellent. He recalls Sen
ator Stanford's habits and the
; phrasing of his remarks:
j "Late at night after the Governor
had finished all his business he used
i to say, 'Well Charlie, how about a
j look around the farm?'"
Charlie would harness up and oil

I they would go, no matter what im
portant affairs were on the Sena
| tor's hands.
"The Governor's folks and my
I folks went to school together in Al-
J bany," Wooster commented.
"Another thing that may interest j
you," he continued, "is that I, like >
the Lindbergh baby, was kidnaped. 1
I The gypsies took me <>fT the front j
porch and 1 was with them a week j
before I was found. In those days j
they went through the .streets, ring- |
! ing a bell, and crying, 'Child lost.' " i
As a boy Wooster exercised the
horses for a riding academy. His
ability was noticed and he was in
â–  duced to become a jockey.
In '07 he lode in the first derby j
to be held in this country.
"It was a great race," Wester said. '
"There were 18 of us in it and most I
of us were in a bunch at the finish." J
He ended thoughtfully:
"My filly came in fifth." '
