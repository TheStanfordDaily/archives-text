SHANGHAI, March 7 (Monday).
(TP; —The arrival of more Japanese
reinforcements today and an admis
sion that one or two more divisions
were enroute from Tokyo prompted
Chinese government circles today to
charge that they feared Japan might
attempt to capture Nanking.
The possibility of further inland
invasions, the Chinese announce
ment said, led a plenary session of
the Central Executive Committee to
designate two cities as temporary
capitals of China.
Honanfu (Loyang) has already
been designated as the temporary
capital and today Sianfu, the capital
of Shensi province, was announced
as a co-capital to be known as the
Western Capital.
j The Chinese authorities today said
the Japanese purpose in sending
j additional troops was to capture
' Nanking and at the same time cut
ofT the nineteenth route army
j (which had been pushed back al
; most to Soochow.)
Meanwhile Japanese bluejackets
threw a ring of barbed wire around
Chapei today to keep out looters,
| hundreds of whom have been ar
| rested by the Japanese military au
| thorities. The looters were princi
' pally Chinese, it was said, although
| many Japanese were mixed' among
| them, and they were active in Hong
| kew as well, where municipal au-
I thorities were taking a hand,
j Bluejackets and civilian Japanese
assistants began to clear Chapei,
; removing the dead for burning and
! disposing of unexploded shells.
