QTANFORD trackmen scored !)1 1-3 points to 39 2-3 for the Olympic
Club's own more or less amateur amateurs last Saturday afternoon t<>
win the opening meet of a promising season in brilliant fashion. The final
official score, however, was (»7 1-3 to (53 2-3. as 24 of the digits registered
by Stanford men were earned by ex-Cards now wearing a red Winged "O"
instead of a red "S" on their white jerseys. These ancient StanforUites,
aided and abetted by others of Charlie Hunter's stars, succeeded in mak
ing the meet so close that it was decided by the relay. True to Stanford
tradition, a quartet including Paul Nash, George Hay, Jim Ferrie, and

Lcs Hables won the baton race by
a narrow margin due mainly to a
perfect exchange from Ferrie to
Hables in which the Indians picked
up a three-yard lead that Les held
to the tape.
Ferric Looks Good
Of most importance to Stanford
track hopes was the excellence dis
played by the less noted members
of the squad. Jim Ferrie, for ex
ample, stepped out and showed the
large crowd that the Cards have a
real miler this year.
Ferrie forced Harry Carter of the
Club to run a 4:27.5 mile to beat
him by ten yards. In the 880, George.'
Naylon showed equal promise by
nearly catching Dick Wright of last
year's varsity in a driving finish.
Naylon ran about 1:59.
Hill "Practices"
The great Ralph Hill entered the
two-mile just for a "workout" after
a week's practice, and stepped oil a
perfect 9:40.5 race to run his fellow
clubman, Gericke, and Ollie Am
dahl of Stanford into the ground and
finish smiling. Amdahl's running
was in its way as good as Hill's, as
the unknown sophomore had never
run better than 10:20 before and
finished in about 9:50.
Frank Lombardi was supposed to
be out of the meet with a bad leg.
but at the last minute he decided
that he could run a 440 and got a
second behind Walts of the Club in
the good time of 49.9. Nash ran a
nice race to finish third.
Hables Wins Two
Captain Ike Hables and Ben East
man did not run, so Les Hables
thought he had to atone for his
brother's and fellow star's absence.
Busy Leslie won the 100 in 9.7, the
220 in 21.8, and held oil Walts' chal
lenge in the relay.
Stanford has two real sprinters
this year, as Ralph Giberson was
just behind Hables in the 100 and
pressed Sparks for second in the
furlong.
Ten Points for Smith
Ex-Captain Podge Smith took
both hurdle races, defeating Brug
man in the highs and then winning
the lows easily when Cotto Herbert
hit a hurdle. Gus Meier finished in
the money in both races, and looks
like the coming hurdle sensation.
Everyone except those who know
Ned Johns were surprised when he
vaulted 13 feet to win the pole
vault, but Ned came through in the
absence of Miller and DeGroot.
Coggeshall copped the high-jump
for the Club, Bob Jones somehow
hoisting his gigantic body over (>
feet to give Stanford a tie for sec
ond.
Arnie West, Virg Dowell, and Kim
Dyer swept the broad-jump for the
Post Streeters in t-pite of the ap
peal of their old Alma Mater. But
Bob Jones, Here Laborde, John Ly
man, and Nellie Gray came right
back at them, taking all nine points
in the two weights.

Ferrie forced Harry Carter of the
Club to run a 4:27.5 mile to beat
him by ten yards. In the 880, George.'
Naylon showed equal promise by
nearly catching Dick Wright of last
year's varsity in a driving finish.
Naylon ran about 1:59.
Hill "Practices"
The great Ralph Hill entered the
two-mile just for a "workout" after
a week's practice, and stepped oil a
perfect 9:40.5 race to run his fellow
clubman, Gericke, and Ollie Am
dahl of Stanford into the ground and
finish smiling. Amdahl's running
was in its way as good as Hill's, as
the unknown sophomore had never
run better than 10:20 before and
finished in about 9:50.
Frank Lombardi was supposed to
be out of the meet with a bad leg.
but at the last minute he decided
that he could run a 440 and got a
second behind Walts of the Club in
the good time of 49.9. Nash ran a
nice race to finish third.
Hables Wins Two
Captain Ike Hables and Ben East
man did not run, so Les Hables
thought he had to atone for his
brother's and fellow star's absence.
Busy Leslie won the 100 in 9.7, the
220 in 21.8, and held oil Walts' chal
lenge in the relay.
Stanford has two real sprinters
this year, as Ralph Giberson was
just behind Hables in the 100 and
pressed Sparks for second in the
furlong.
Ten Points for Smith
Ex-Captain Podge Smith took
both hurdle races, defeating Brug
man in the highs and then winning
the lows easily when Cotto Herbert
hit a hurdle. Gus Meier finished in
the money in both races, and looks
like the coming hurdle sensation.
Everyone except those who know
Ned Johns were surprised when he
vaulted 13 feet to win the pole
vault, but Ned came through in the
absence of Miller and DeGroot.
Coggeshall copped the high-jump
for the Club, Bob Jones somehow
hoisting his gigantic body over (>
feet to give Stanford a tie for sec
ond.
Arnie West, Virg Dowell, and Kim
Dyer swept the broad-jump for the
Post Streeters in t-pite of the ap
peal of their old Alma Mater. But
Bob Jones, Here Laborde, John Ly
man, and Nellie Gray came right
back at them, taking all nine points
in the two weights.

QTANFORD trackmen scored !)1 1-3 points to 39 2-3 for the Olympic
Club's own more or less amateur amateurs last Saturday afternoon t<>
win the opening meet of a promising season in brilliant fashion. The final
official score, however, was (»7 1-3 to (53 2-3. as 24 of the digits registered
by Stanford men were earned by ex-Cards now wearing a red Winged "O"
instead of a red "S" on their white jerseys. These ancient StanforUites,
aided and abetted by others of Charlie Hunter's stars, succeeded in mak
ing the meet so close that it was decided by the relay. True to Stanford
tradition, a quartet including Paul Nash, George Hay, Jim Ferrie, and

Lcs Hables won the baton race by
a narrow margin due mainly to a
perfect exchange from Ferrie to
Hables in which the Indians picked
up a three-yard lead that Les held
to the tape.
Ferric Looks Good

track hopes was the excellence dis
