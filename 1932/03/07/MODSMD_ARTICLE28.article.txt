# THE 						HYPOCRITES GATHER
## 
### 
When ILi c Jntcr'fraternity Hoard of Control met last
Thursday night to consider the eases of the 12 houses
turned in for illegal rushing, it uncovered the worst mess
in the rushing situation that has hcen revealed in some
time.
The (juestion is, what is the Hoard going to do about it?
Enough evidence has been gained from the freshmen
who were questioned at the last meeting and from other
sources to convince even the most optimistic member of
llie Hoard that praclically without exception every house
on the campus has been rushing illegally. There is no one
who has any connection with the fraternities but knows
definitely that all the houses are implicated; some, per
haps, more than others.
The Hoard, as well as the rest of the campus, knows the
situation and may feel constrained to act to save its own
face. Consequently, it is conducting this farcical inquisi
tion. Some fraternity men were called before the last
meeting and asked if their house had done any illegal
rushing a question to which every member of the Hoard
knew the answer before it was asked.
Thus the Hoard is either forcing the men to lie to save
their own houses or admit their guilt, knowing that by
acting honorably they will probably be rewarded by pun
ishment. How can the Hoard, with any feeling of righteous
ness. penalize a certain number of fraternities who have
confessed or against whom there is sufficient evidence for
conviction, when each member of the Hoard knows that
the reason some of the houses are escaping is because they
deliberately lied out of it or were too slick to be caught?
II is a peculiar thing to punish honesty and reward hy
pocrisy.
If the Hoard feels that this silly questioning is getting
anywhere, let it call every house before it and ask if any
illegal rushing has been done, for the Hoard knows that all
are equally guilty. Nor is there any difference in degree
and one house should not be penalized more than another.
If' one fraternity is convicted on two charges and another
on one, both should be punished equally. If not, there is a
premium put on cleverness in evading the rules and deceit
in getting out of tlie charges, for both are guilty of more
than has been reported.
If the Board had met in January or February, and taken
some action then, this horrible mess might have been
avoided.' However, if didn't and now probably feels that it
should penalize somebody for something.
What the Hoard should do is drop the whole filing and
not punish any house. If could well spend the time wasted
in ils useless inquisition in working out some constructive
plan lo prevent a recurrence of the present situation. Any
penalizing action if may take will be only false justice in a
feeble attempt to justify ils own existence.
The fraternities should go before the Hoard and admit
their guilt like gentlemen. If all confess, nothing can
rightly be done to them, for if would be proof lluit the
fault lies in the system and the rules and not with the
individuals breaking them.

The (juestion is, what is the Hoard going to do about it?
Enough evidence has been gained from the freshmen
who were questioned at the last meeting and from other
sources to convince even the most optimistic member of
llie Hoard that praclically without exception every house
on the campus has been rushing illegally. There is no one
who has any connection with the fraternities but knows
definitely that all the houses are implicated; some, per
haps, more than others.
The Hoard, as well as the rest of the campus, knows the
situation and may feel constrained to act to save its own
face. Consequently, it is conducting this farcical inquisi
tion. Some fraternity men were called before the last
meeting and asked if their house had done any illegal
rushing a question to which every member of the Hoard
knew the answer before it was asked.
Thus the Hoard is either forcing the men to lie to save
their own houses or admit their guilt, knowing that by
acting honorably they will probably be rewarded by pun
ishment. How can the Hoard, with any feeling of righteous
ness. penalize a certain number of fraternities who have
confessed or against whom there is sufficient evidence for
conviction, when each member of the Hoard knows that
the reason some of the houses are escaping is because they
deliberately lied out of it or were too slick to be caught?
II is a peculiar thing to punish honesty and reward hy
pocrisy.
If the Hoard feels that this silly questioning is getting
anywhere, let it call every house before it and ask if any
illegal rushing has been done, for the Hoard knows that all
are equally guilty. Nor is there any difference in degree
and one house should not be penalized more than another.
If' one fraternity is convicted on two charges and another
on one, both should be punished equally. If not, there is a
premium put on cleverness in evading the rules and deceit
in getting out of tlie charges, for both are guilty of more
than has been reported.
If the Board had met in January or February, and taken
some action then, this horrible mess might have been
avoided.' However, if didn't and now probably feels that it
should penalize somebody for something.
What the Hoard should do is drop the whole filing and
not punish any house. If could well spend the time wasted
in ils useless inquisition in working out some constructive
plan lo prevent a recurrence of the present situation. Any
penalizing action if may take will be only false justice in a
feeble attempt to justify ils own existence.
The fraternities should go before the Hoard and admit
their guilt like gentlemen. If all confess, nothing can
rightly be done to them, for if would be proof lluit the
fault lies in the system and the rules and not with the
individuals breaking them.
When ILi c Jntcr'fraternity Hoard of Control met last
Thursday night to consider the eases of the 12 houses
turned in for illegal rushing, it uncovered the worst mess
in the rushing situation that has hcen revealed in some
time.
