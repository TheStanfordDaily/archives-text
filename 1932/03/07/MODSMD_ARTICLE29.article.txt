# DESERVED RECOGNITION

### 
Seven of Stanford's boxers will get a real reward for
llieir aelivilies tomorrow in the shape of the annual Gene
Tunney awards, li> he announced hy (loach Harry Malonev
al the s(|uad dinner. Jiased on character and inlerest in
the sport as well as on listic* ability, this recognition of
merit probably indicates more genuine worth 011 the part
(if the recipients than any other athletic award given to
Stanford athletes.
Xo one can say that the glove slingers don't deserve all
they get. Working in most cases all the year round, they
spend just as much lime and effort 011 the sport as the
majority of major sport competitors, yet many of them
never so much as see their names in print. And spectators
;il the various matches held this year can vouch for the
fact that Moloney's men put on a mighty interesting show
with plenty of lirsl class boxing in evidence.
With the relative lack of importance usually attached
to a circle "S' taken into account, these Tunney medals are
a much needed factor in promoting ring interest here.
Something of the sort would be very welcome in other
minor sports, and il is at leasl to be hoped that the gentle
manly (iene will continue his generous donations in the
flit lire.
