# BULL SESSION
## THE 						END-QUARTER JAM 
### 
Do your work every day and then |
when the end of the term rolls |
around, there will be no terrifying i
piling up to haunt your days and j
ruin your nights. That is the way ;
i the old legend runs. That is the j
| advice given by professors and by
wise seniors to innocent frosh. j
| Everyone likes to dream of that !
! golden quarter when the last week
will find all term papers finished, j
all original reading done, and l
nothing to do but calmly review!
while others are hecticly cramming.
I
But one of the big reasons why j
, that is never the case is because!
! professors usually pile on the work
j in the last week out of all propor- ;
tion to the rest of the quarter. They '
| will trot the students for about nine
j weeks and then expect them to fly j
: through the last week; when, like J
: tired horses, it is best to walk them !
; into their stalls. There is a current j
; case where the last week's new as
! signment is practically 25 per cent |
| of the work covered the entire 1
proceeding part of this quarter.
If professors become absorbed in j
a subject—if a quarter is too brief '
a space for a course, should the |
! students suffer? It is comparable to
; asking a workman to dig a ditch j
i from the Li be to the post office in j
} a week, then when Friday rolled I

I around—come laughing in his face, j
! and impart the happy tidings that
lie will complete his ditch to the
! cheerful shores of Lagunita and by
j the end of the week! The poor
; ditch-digger is in no worse situa
i tion than the unfortunate student ,
with the last-minute assignment.
Ditch-diggers usually being of a
low order of mentality the one in
j our story would be completely lost.
1 But if ditch-diggers had a college (
! education—and many have during
! these days of scarce jobs for gradu
! ates—they will simply scrape a j
j shallow trench to Lagunita in the
' appointed time. That is exactly what
college students do. They rush
j through the work in such a helter
skelter fashion that lack of sleep is
all they have to show at the end of ,
: the quarter.
Tl?e last week of school has no
more hours in it than any other
week. There is no reason why col-
I legians should have to work at any j
faster speed this last week. Educa
! tion is not a business and cannot be j
j calculated like the output of a can-
J nery, but surely a little planning of j
the material to be covered in the
! time allotted would bring greater j
1 peace, prosperity, and contentment
i to the weary hearts of many poor
| college students.

Do your work every day and then |
when the end of the term rolls |
around, there will be no terrifying i
piling up to haunt your days and j
ruin your nights. That is the way ;
i the old legend runs. That is the j
| advice given by professors and by
wise seniors to innocent frosh. j
| Everyone likes to dream of that !
! golden quarter when the last week
will find all term papers finished, j
all original reading done, and l
nothing to do but calmly review!
while others are hecticly cramming.
I
But one of the big reasons why j
, that is never the case is because!
! professors usually pile on the work
j in the last week out of all propor- ;
tion to the rest of the quarter. They '
| will trot the students for about nine
j weeks and then expect them to fly j
: through the last week; when, like J
: tired horses, it is best to walk them !
; into their stalls. There is a current j
; case where the last week's new as
! signment is practically 25 per cent |
| of the work covered the entire 1
proceeding part of this quarter.
If professors become absorbed in j
a subject—if a quarter is too brief '
a space for a course, should the |
! students suffer? It is comparable to
; asking a workman to dig a ditch j
i from the Li be to the post office in j
} a week, then when Friday rolled I

I around—come laughing in his face, j
! and impart the happy tidings that
lie will complete his ditch to the
! cheerful shores of Lagunita and by
j the end of the week! The poor
; ditch-digger is in no worse situa
i tion than the unfortunate student ,
with the last-minute assignment.
Ditch-diggers usually being of a
low order of mentality the one in
j our story would be completely lost.
1 But if ditch-diggers had a college (
! education—and many have during
! these days of scarce jobs for gradu
! ates—they will simply scrape a j
j shallow trench to Lagunita in the
' appointed time. That is exactly what
college students do. They rush
j through the work in such a helter
skelter fashion that lack of sleep is
all they have to show at the end of ,
: the quarter.
Tl?e last week of school has no
more hours in it than any other
week. There is no reason why col-
I legians should have to work at any j
faster speed this last week. Educa
! tion is not a business and cannot be j
j calculated like the output of a can-
J nery, but surely a little planning of j
the material to be covered in the
! time allotted would bring greater j
1 peace, prosperity, and contentment
i to the weary hearts of many poor
| college students.
