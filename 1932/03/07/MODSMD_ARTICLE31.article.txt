COUGAR—At the Varsity Theatre. <
Don't let the sleepy looking nioun- I
tain lion out in front of the theatre ;
mislead you. Cougars are poison and j
this picture is one of those extreme j
rarities in filmdom, a movie that
lives up to its publicity blurb and is |
really worth seeing.
Jay Bruce, the famous lion |
hunter, is caught in a series of I
hunts by the reliable camera of j
Sidney Snow of South African and
Polar fame. If the idea of climbing j
into a tree after a six-foot cougar,
slipping a rope around its neck, and
wrestling with it, conveys any thrill
to your jaded spirits, the actual'
picture should do more. With a
minimum of faking Snow has ex
tracted the maximum of excitement
out of the experiences of Bruce and
his dogs.
The show has the character of one
of those good old road shows, with
the caged lion in front and both
Snow and Bruce and one of the
dogs, making personal appearances.
And all of them are interesting.
This is not merely a picture for
zoologists; in fact it would be crim
inal for anyone to miss it.
Shorts—pretty good.
