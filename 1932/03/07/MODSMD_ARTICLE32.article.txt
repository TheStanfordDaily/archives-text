### 
"Duke'' Ellington and his band
have all they can do at the Or
pheum to stay on a par with Con
stance Bennett on the silvery screen
in "Lady with a Past" this week.
Ellington and his gang are good. In
fact, they're infinitely more than
just good, for they fairly radiate
rhythm. But for an unusually well
hnndled comedy about, a beautiful
blonde heiress who just can't make
the boys like her, one wouldn't
realize that there was anything else
except this bunch of music-makers
with their primitive harmony.
This marks the third week for
the "Duke," and as yet no audience
has ceased applauding when the
curtain finally dropped as the wild,
soothing strains of "Mood Indigo"
completed the offering. Ivie Ander
son, blues singer, combines with the
"Four Step" brothers to hold a tense
and fascinating audience at an angle
of forty-five degrees in their seats
and pointed toward the stage.
