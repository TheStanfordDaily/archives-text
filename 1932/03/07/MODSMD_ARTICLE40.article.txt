INVADERS OF the Farm laid
own a heavy barrage on the Indian
jorts front Saturday.
Wilh Coach Dink Templeton con
ned to the Stanford hospital, Cap
lin Ike Hables to the Palo Alto
hospital, and Ben Eastman to the
defines, Stanford's track team just
as able to overcome the sur.pris
igly strong bid of the Olympic Club
l the major event of the week-end,
le opening track meet of the sea-
Stanford swimmers covered
themselves with glory in smash
ing two intercollegiate records
and sending California home oil
the short end of an overwhelm
ing (53 to 21 defeat. The water
poluists kept up the good work
by crushing the Bear splashers
7 to 2, while the Frosh shut out
the U.C. babes, !) to 0.
Glancing at the other side of the
dger, we find Harry Wolter's base
all nine coming out on the short
■id of a 7 to (! score over at Moraga,
ninth-inning rally which pushed
o less than live runs across the
late proving too much for the In
ian .sluggers.
The frosh nine also ran into the
inth-inning hoodoo, gaining no
ctter than a 9 to 9 tie with Roose
.• 11 High School of Oakland.
Stanford fencers, however,
came through as expected
against California, winning the
annual melee by 17 matches to
eight.
The yearling racquet-wielders
jwned Berkeley High School, while
ie varsity was holding an exhibi
on match with Burlingame. Mean
hile a greatly favored golf team
tn into grief across the bay, drop
ng the match with California.
All in all, it was a heavy week
id for the Cards.
OVER AT Oakland, a fast Cali
■rnia basketball five atoned for
st year's drubbing at Seattle by
irning back the Washington Hus
tes in two straight games.
The feature of the series was the
renuous objection raised to the
Ticiating of Einil Piluso, northern
licial. Piluso called them too close
suit California fans.
It seems to us that a little
closer calling of fouls by south
ern division officials would do
no harm. We have a game in
this section of the conference
that is hardly basketball—it is a
cross between football and
hockey. Body contact is the rule
rather than the exception, and
frequent injuries result.
Fundamentally, basketball is not
game of body contact, and a fast,
gh-seoring contest depends on the
net enforcement of the rules by I
e officials.
It not only makes for a better |
.me for the teams concerned, but !
r the fans when the officials call j
n close. Have you ever noticed |
e scores up North? The winner's i
ore is usually in the 40's, while
the southern division, it may be
the 20 s.
JIM OLIVER, Palo Alto grade
hool student, is one of the proud
t lads in the state. Didn't he ask
members of the Detroit Tiger
uad to autograph a baseball for
m? And didn't they do it? Not
ly that, the 14 signers couldn't see
hy Jim should be satisfied with a
•re 14 signatures, so they dug up
ur others to fill up all the avail
)le space on the ball for him.
