•into a thousand pieces Saturday}
J afternoon when the Golden Bear |
I sank to the bottom of the Encina I
I pools with a 63 to 21 weight tied
' around his neck. The Cardinal;
j freshmen held their opponents un- j
j der the water by a 58 to 17 score, j
' And in addition to all this the var- ;
j sity took their water polo game, 7-2, |
the yearlings, theirs, iJ-0, and Tuppy ,
Gardner tied his own Pacific Coast]
100-yard mark.
McKelvey Sets Time
John McKelvey provided the sen
sation of the day by thrashing his j
; way for 50 yards in the short pool j
! to finish under the national inter- j
j collegiate mark and within a fifth !
( of a second of Johnny Weissmuller's >
i world record. The national intercol- !
' legiate mark was 215.2 seconds, held j
I jointly by Schwartz, of Northwest- j
; ern, and Rule, of Annapolis; Weiss- ;
: muller's is 22.8, and McKelvey's is j
'23 flat.
McKelvey horned in on another j
j national intercollegiate mark when j
I he swam lead-off man in the 400- |
j yard relay. He, Ted Wiget, Frank
1 Booth, and Tuppy Gardner hung up j
! a new 3 minute, 38.1 time, as against :
| the former mark of 3:38.6, held by j
i Rutgers.
I Austin Clapp did his part of the J
record-breaking when he shattered •
Buster Crabbe's 440-yard free-style 1
Pacific Coast mark of 5:06 flat.
New 220 Record
To improve a Pacific Coast mark j
already in the Indian collection, I
| Captain Frank Booth and Ted Wiget j
j both finished in new record time for
the 220. Booth led his teammate to [
I the finish by less than a yard to j
I turn in 2:15.2 time, the old mark |
of 2:17.4 being held by Clapp.
The four freshman records broken i
were in the 200-yard relay, the 200- j
yard breast, the 150-yard back, and J
j the 300-yard medley relay. A team i
i composed of Cook, Taranik. Triolo, |
| and Boothe turned the first trick,!
; lowering the former 1:47.2 mark i
j held by California to 1:45.8.

| The only one of those four that j
! went to California and, incidentally,
the only first place in swimming the ;

yard breaststroke, which Lang- \
worthy took in 2 minutes, 46.4 sec- j
onds. The former mark was 3:01.0. j

teammate, Fuller, for freshman first j
place.
