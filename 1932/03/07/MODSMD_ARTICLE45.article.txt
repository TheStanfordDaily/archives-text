# BABE GOLFERS BEAT CALIFORNIA 18 TO 9
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman golf team
won an 18-9 decision over the Cali
fornia Cubs at Castlewood Country
Club last Saturday, but it wasn't
the team's top ranking men who
were responsible for the victory.
Joe Graves, William Iloelle, and
Walter Hill couldn't cope with the
first three Cub golfers, but Roger
Roberts and Harold Scheeline con
tributed eight points to the frosh
total with singles triumphs and a
victory when paired together in
doubles play. Six points were gained
due to California's defaults.
