Phi Kappa Sigma-Thela Chi, El
Toro-Business School, and Sigma
Chi-Menlo Hashers; that's the pro
gram for tonight's intramural quar
ter-finals.
They've gone through five con
secutive games without defeat;
they've won their respective league
championships; and yet three of
these unbeaten basketball quintets
must fall by the wayside tonight.
Three of these squads and Delta
Upsilon, who drew a first-round
bye, will still be in the running to
morrow when the semi-finals get
under way. Another three will put
their equipment away at the close

of tonight's affairs. But, victorious
or not, each team is bound to put
up a struggle.
Who will win the Phi Kap-Theta
Chi or the Menlo-Sig Chi affair, no
one will venture to predict. The
teams seem on a par. El Toro, with
their dead-eye Bob Fisher as the
key man of a fast offense, is favored
over the Business School because of
decisive wins in league play.
Unless men have competed in at
least two league games, they are
ineligible for competition in these
play-offs, Gene Mires announced
Friday. In addition, he stated that
members of the coaching staff would
referee the encounters.
