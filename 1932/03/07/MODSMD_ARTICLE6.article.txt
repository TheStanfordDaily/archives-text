# Fraternities Appear Tonight To Explain Pre-Season Rushing
## Questioning of Freshmen Occupies Board Until 2 A.M. At Thursday Night's Meeting; Severe Penalties To Result From All Convictions 
### 
A ITER a six-hour session of gruelling freshmen with little or no result
Thursday night, the Interfraternity Board will go into action again in
the Old Union at 7:150 o'clock tonight questioning members of the various
houses, endeavoring to lay the blame for the alleged violations of the
rushing rules. Although Warren Biggs, chairman of the Board, denied that
any new names had been turned in, rumors 011 the campus involve at least
>six more of the fraternities than the 12 already implicated. He said that
£ every effort would be made to bring

j convictions, it the evidence so tar
turned in proved to be authentic.
No action has been taken at all on
j the infractions of the rules, since the
j Board is trying by questioning ev
i eryone so far reported to get as
i much evidence as possible on which
to base decisions.
Thursday night's meeting opened
' with only three Row groups in
j volved, but as the members and
| freshmen were questioned, more
| and more were dragged into the
j battle. Since nothing could be
j gained from the fraternity men,
i they were dismissed to be called at
; Monday's meeting, and the atten
j tion of the Board was centered on
I the hastily summoned freshmen who
j were kept from their beds until 2
i o'clock.
Penalties To lie Given
Members ef the board did not in-
I dieate what penalties would result
j from convictions but insisted that no
j offenders who are duly convicted
| will be let off. However, the total
j innocence of everyone questioned at
[ the session Thursday night makes
i proof of any illegality difficult, and
j unless something new appears at the
| meeting tonight, the Board will have
| little material to work with.
