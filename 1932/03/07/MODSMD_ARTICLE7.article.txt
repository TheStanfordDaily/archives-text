### 
i
i
Two walks, two hits, two errors j
and one hit batter enabled the St. J
Mary's varsity baseball team to ;
score five runs in the last half of !
the ninth inning and eke out a 7-6 |
I decision over the visiting Stanford ;
j nine Saturday in the odd game of
| their annual three-game series,
j Stan Anderson, Cardinal chucker,
; had held the Saints to eight hits and j
only two runs until the ninth, but I
in the last frame he weakened and i
was replaced by Herm Estes. This 1
! is the second game in which the j
• slender right-hander has been called !
I upon to do relief work, and for the |
I second time Fate has given him the 1
: small end of the deal.
Estes came to the mound with j
two runs already across, two men
on the paths, and the Saints' hard- i
' hitting sophomore, Wilson, at bat.
Wilson grounded weakly to Traut
man, but the third baseman bubbled
the ball, and the bases were loaded.
Jones, the right-fielder who won
j the other game at Moraga for the
, home forces, again came through
1 with a single, scoring Rowan and
| McDermott and sending Wilson to
j third. Kane fliod to Rintala for the
j first out, but in attempting to hold
j Wilson on third the Card captain
| threw wide of the base, and the ball
i game was over.

Estes came to the mound with j
two runs already across, two men

' hitting sophomore, Wilson, at bat.
Wilson grounded weakly to Traut
man, but the third baseman bubbled
the ball, and the bases were loaded.

j the other game at Moraga for the
