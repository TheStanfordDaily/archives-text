# GARDNER POINTS OUT NECESSITY OF FAITH
## 
### 
In his sermon yesterday in the
Stanford Memorial Church com
memorating Founders' Day, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner, Univer
sity chaplain, pointed out the fact
that it was the intention of the
Founders to provide adequate re
ligious life for all of the students.
Gardner, in conclusion, said that
this is an age of doubt, but that
there is still faith, and it is the stu
dent with faith who derives the
most from his college life.
