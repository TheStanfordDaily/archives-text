# CRUCIAL TEST AWAITS VARSITY NINE IN SOUTH
## Team Leaves For U.C.L.A. And U.S.C. Games at End Of Finals TEAM NOT ANNOUNCED Team Choice To Depend On Detroit Games 
### Bob Wade 
With a varsity baseball team that i
has already lost as many games as j
last year's championship outfit, but |
that shows more potential strength j
than was possessed by the pennant j
winners, Coach Harry Wolter will j
leave for the South immediately af- '
ter examinations are concluded to j
encounter the best that Coaches A1 !
Montgomery and Sam Barry have |
been able to turn out at U.C.L.A. j
and U.S.C., respectively.
Wolter will not announce the j
members of the squad who are i
going on the trip until this week's j
practice sessions are over, but it is j
safe to say that Livermore, Ander- j
son, Goodell, Philippi, Trautman, ,
Delmas, Goldmann, Captain Rintala, I
and Campbell will be among those j
present when the Stanford baseball
equipment goes South.
Reserve Team
In addition to those already men- j
tioned, all of whom were in the last |
St. Mary's battle, Wolter will prob- j
ably take almost a full reserve j
team.
Pitchers Estes, Caddel, Stark, and
possibly Savinske, will round out
the mound corps, while Massey and
perhaps Hunt will back up Liver
more in the catching department. '
The utility infielder who will ac
company the team is the most
doubtful question at present. The j
contest has narrowed down to a
battle between Jim Kelly, who
made his letter two years ago on
the Southern trip, and Bill Triplett,
who held down second base on the
.1933 freshman outfit.
In the outfield Wolter has very
little substituting to do, but he will
probably take Dick Miles, who has
gone in as a pinch-hitter in two
games already, and Jim Irsfeld, who
played left field on the freshman
team two years ago.
The addition of Hunt to the
catching staff would give the In
dians a good pinch-hitter as well as
a dependable backstop.
Depending largely on his per
formance this week, in the game or
games with the Detroit rookies, Art
Hearns may get a chance at the
league games down South as a sub
stitute for Fred Goodell at first base.

going on the trip until this week's j
practice sessions are over, but it is j
safe to say that Livermore, Ander- j
son, Goodell, Philippi, Trautman, ,
Delmas, Goldmann, Captain Rintala, I
and Campbell will be among those j
present when the Stanford baseball
equipment goes South.
Reserve Team
In addition to those already men- j
tioned, all of whom were in the last |
St. Mary's battle, Wolter will prob- j
ably take almost a full reserve j
team.
Pitchers Estes, Caddel, Stark, and
possibly Savinske, will round out
the mound corps, while Massey and
perhaps Hunt will back up Liver
more in the catching department. '
The utility infielder who will ac
company the team is the most
doubtful question at present. The j
contest has narrowed down to a
battle between Jim Kelly, who
made his letter two years ago on
the Southern trip, and Bill Triplett,
who held down second base on the
.1933 freshman outfit.
In the outfield Wolter has very
little substituting to do, but he will
probably take Dick Miles, who has
gone in as a pinch-hitter in two
games already, and Jim Irsfeld, who
played left field on the freshman
team two years ago.
The addition of Hunt to the
catching staff would give the In
dians a good pinch-hitter as well as
a dependable backstop.
Depending largely on his per
formance this week, in the game or
games with the Detroit rookies, Art
Hearns may get a chance at the
league games down South as a sub
stitute for Fred Goodell at first base.
