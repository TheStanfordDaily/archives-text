# CARDS TO MEET NORTHWESTERN IN WATER DUEL
## Brandsten Hopes To Break Three-Year Jinx, Win National Title 
### 
| Bent on setting the Cardinal flag
j waving more gracefully than ever,
J five men and Coach Ernst Brandsten
j will travel to Ann Arbor, Michigan,
to compete in the National Colle- j
giate Athletic Association swimming
championships March 25 and 2G.
Captain Frank Booth, Austin
Clapp, defending national intercolle- j
giate 220-yard champion, Ted Wiget, |
John McKelvey, national intercolle- j
giate record-holder for 50 yards, |
and Tuppy Gardner will make the
| journey.
Meet Northwestern
The quintet, accompanied by
j Coach Brandsten and Rufus Rucker,
i California's diver, will leave March
j 18 for Evanston, Illinois, where the
Indians will swim against North-
I western University i na dual meet
! the twenty-second.
The Cards have never beaten the j
strong Northwestern team, but if an
agreement can be reached to ex
clude diving and the medley relay,
I some hope is justified, as Clapp can
i handle the breast-stroke and Booth
| the back, besides their regular free
! style specialties. At Northwestern j
I the fates will offer McKelvey an- I
! other shot at the world's 50-yard |
' record when he swims in the short j
| 60-foot pool.
Michigan Defends
| At the national championships
| Stanford, Michigan, Northwestern, j
| and Rutgers are conceded to be the
1 chief battlers. Michigan is the de
! fending champion, and has been for
, three years; this year will bring a
| strong set of stars from the cham
-1 pions, as usual.
* Schmeiler is Michigan's great |
: threat, an expert in the breast-stroke I
! and both sprints and distance in the !
! free-style. Degener will handle their j
| end of the diving, with Mickey j
j Riley of Southern California con- j
! ceded the victory in this event. They i
J also offer Drysdale in the back
l troke, and, to cap all, their medley |
[ relay team recently broke the na- j
j tional intercollegiate record.
Navy, Yale May Enter
Rutgers boasts Walter Spence, ;
i holder of the world's breast-stroke
i mark. Navy and Yale have never j
j gone to this meet, but if they should j
j send a team they undoubtedly would ;
I make a strong bid for honors. North
j western's main strength lies in her 1
| quartet of sprinters, Highland, i
j Troup. Wilcox, and Wilson.
Both McKelvey and Gardner will
| enter the 50 and 100 for the Car-
I dinals, Booth, Clapp, and Wiget will I
j all enter the 220 and 440, and all
I except Clapp will compose the relay |

Meet Northwestern
The quintet, accompanied by
j Coach Brandsten and Rufus Rucker,
i California's diver, will leave March
j 18 for Evanston, Illinois, where the
Indians will swim against North-
I western University i na dual meet
! the twenty-second.
The Cards have never beaten the j
strong Northwestern team, but if an
agreement can be reached to ex
clude diving and the medley relay,
I some hope is justified, as Clapp can
i handle the breast-stroke and Booth
| the back, besides their regular free
! style specialties. At Northwestern j
I the fates will offer McKelvey an- I
! other shot at the world's 50-yard |
' record when he swims in the short j
| 60-foot pool.
Michigan Defends
| At the national championships
| Stanford, Michigan, Northwestern, j
| and Rutgers are conceded to be the
1 chief battlers. Michigan is the de
! fending champion, and has been for
, three years; this year will bring a
| strong set of stars from the cham
-1 pions, as usual.
* Schmeiler is Michigan's great |
: threat, an expert in the breast-stroke I
! and both sprints and distance in the !
! free-style. Degener will handle their j
| end of the diving, with Mickey j
j Riley of Southern California con- j
! ceded the victory in this event. They i
J also offer Drysdale in the back
l troke, and, to cap all, their medley |
[ relay team recently broke the na- j
j tional intercollegiate record.

i holder of the world's breast-stroke
i mark. Navy and Yale have never j
