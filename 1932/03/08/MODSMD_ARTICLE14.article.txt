(Editorial) I
Rushing of all men in the class ,
of 1935 will he postponed until fall '
quarter ruled the Interfratermty I
Board of Control.
This edict shows that the Board
had a keen understanding of the
existing situation, that all frater
nities are equally compromised in
the breaking of the rushing rules
and that the fault does not lie en
tirely with the houses. Its action j
is unquestionably just and its lack j
of unfair discrimination is admir- j
able.
The postponement of rushing ;
may be considered harsh, but if it
brings the fraternities to a reali
zation of the seriousness of the sit
uation, its effect will be far more I
beneficial than harmful.
The administration has permit- j
ted the fraternities to conduct
their own affairs. If they cannot |
prove in the near future that they |
are capable of meeting the existing |
conditions and acting honorably,l
the control may be taken out of
their hands and given to the ad
ministration.
The Board of Control has played
square and it is up to the fraterni
ties to prove that they are able to ;
handle their own problems lest
their very existence on the Stan
ford campus he jeopardized.
