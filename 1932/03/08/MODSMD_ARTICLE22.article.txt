# NO RUSHING OF MEN OF '35 TILL OCTOBER SAYS BOARD
## All Houses Suffer Same Penalty For Breaking Of Rules Interfraternity Board of Control Rules That Official Rushing Take Place During Second Week of Autumn Quarter; Pledging to Follow PLEDGES GIVEN RESIDENCE IN HOUSES NOV. 1 All 24 Fraternities Are Implicated in Illegal Rushing; Council May Revise or Amend New Law 
### 
No rushing of members of the class of 1935 will take placc
until next fall quarter.
This decision was made by the lnterfraternity Board of
Control late last night as a result of a general violation of
rushing rules that has been brought to light during the past
week.
A minority in the Board stood for much more drastic ac
tion. It was unanimously agreed, however, that violations
have been so widespread as to justify a general penalty.
The resolution of the Board provided:

That rushing of all men of the
Class of 1935 be deferred to two
weeks after the opening of classes
in fall quarter, and then have two
weeks of controlled rushing after
which pledging will be held in the
usual way. The pledged men will
be allowed to live in the houses they
have chosen on November 1. 1932.
In accordance with the suggestion
of the Board, Warren Biggs, chair
man, will call a meeting of the In
terfraternity Council on Thursday
evening, at which the fraternity
representatives can make such
changes, suggestions, and revisions
in agreement with the University
housing regulations as they see fit,
subject 1o approval of the lnterf ra
ternity Board of Control.
At a meeting of the Board called
last Thursday night to act on three
reported violations the testimony of
the fraternity men and freshmen
called as witnesses involved the rest
of the houses on the campus. The
meeting, lasting until 2 o'clock in
the morning, was occupied in ques
tioning members of the freshman
class, reported to have gone on the
illegal rushing parties.
When it became evident that few
if any houses had not violated the
rushing rules, it was decided that a
general penalty would be the only
way of punishing both the freshmen
and the houses. Some sentiment
existed among Board members
which favored deferring of rushing
until next winter quarter, but it
was eventually decided that wait
ing until October would be severe
enough.
The present closed rules will ap
ply from now until October unless
they are amended by rulings of the
Interfraternity Council.
The members of the Board, who
were all present, are Warren Biggs,
chairman; Johnny Deuel, secretary;
George B. Culver, dean of men;
Shirley Baker, '95; Frank Booth,
Wally Butler, Professor Elmer D.

called as witnesses involved the rest
of the houses on the campus. The
meeting, lasting until 2 o'clock in
the morning, was occupied in ques
tioning members of the freshman
class, reported to have gone on the
illegal rushing parties.
When it became evident that few
if any houses had not violated the
rushing rules, it was decided that a
general penalty would be the only
way of punishing both the freshmen
and the houses. Some sentiment
existed among Board members
which favored deferring of rushing
until next winter quarter, but it
was eventually decided that wait
ing until October would be severe
enough.
The present closed rules will ap
ply from now until October unless
they are amended by rulings of the
Interfraternity Council.

were all present, are Warren Biggs,

WASHINGTON. March 7. (IP)—A
possibility that President Hoover
may ask Attorney General Mitchell
for an opinion upon certain portions
of the bill to distribute 40.000,000
bushels of Farm Board wheat to titer
unemployed was disclosed today by
John Barton Payne, chairman of the
Red Cross which would distribute
this grain.
No rushing of members of the class of 1935 will take placc
until next fall quarter.
This decision was made by the lnterfraternity Board of
Control late last night as a result of a general violation of
rushing rules that has been brought to light during the past
week.
A minority in the Board stood for much more drastic ac
tion. It was unanimously agreed, however, that violations
have been so widespread as to justify a general penalty.
The resolution of the Board provided:

That rushing of all men of the
Class of 1935 be deferred to two
weeks after the opening of classes
in fall quarter, and then have two
weeks of controlled rushing after
which pledging will be held in the
usual way. The pledged men will
be allowed to live in the houses they
have chosen on November 1. 1932.
In accordance with the suggestion
of the Board, Warren Biggs, chair
man, will call a meeting of the In
terfraternity Council on Thursday
evening, at which the fraternity
representatives can make such
changes, suggestions, and revisions
in agreement with the University
housing regulations as they see fit,
subject 1o approval of the lnterf ra
ternity Board of Control.
At a meeting of the Board called
last Thursday night to act on three
reported violations the testimony of
the fraternity men and freshmen
called as witnesses involved the rest
of the houses on the campus. The
meeting, lasting until 2 o'clock in
the morning, was occupied in ques

class, reported to have gone on the
