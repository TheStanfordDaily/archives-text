# Queen Can Be "Hello Girl" If King Chooses
## Plenty of Competition For Farm Co-eds

Queen's honors in the colorful
Masque Ball which heads spring so
cial activities will not be restricted
to either Stanford or Mills women,
it was learned yesterday as the
Rally Committee announced the re
vision of a former decision to that
effect.
She will be entirely "King's
Choice." That is, she may hail from
Mills, Stanford, U.C., Cartilleja,
Paly High School, or even U.S.C. —
if she can walk that far. This policy
throws the local "500" right into the
open in competition with the rest
of the world. Reasons given for this
decision, based on the assumption
that Stanford women can hold their
own with any import, were outlined
as follows by Ed Boyles, Rally
Committee chairman.
1. —Stanford is essentially a man's
college, and, consequently the inter
est of the men is not entirely cen
tered in campus women.
2. Fairness demands that the field
be opened to any of those strata of
women where Stanford men's in
terests lie.
3.—Forty-one per cent of Stanford
women marry Stanford men.
4.—Hence the action merely
evolves into tacit recognition of a
long-standing fact.
