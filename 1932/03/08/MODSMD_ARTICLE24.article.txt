# ROMEO AND JULIET IS NEXT PLAY
## 
### 
"Romeo and Juliet," by Shake
speare, will be the next campus
production.
Harold Helvenston, director of
Stanford dramatics, announced last
night that this famous play will be
presented to theatre-goers on the
night of April 22.
This will be the largest produc
tion of its kind attempted for sev
eral seasons, involving as it does
some 40 to 50 parts, including ex
tras. Striking a new note in campus
dramatics, the production is pri
marily important for the reason ihat
it has been a matter of six years
since Shakespeare has been seen on
(he Stanford stage, and in the last
two years no production locally or
in San Francisco of this play has
been attempted. The original folio
version is being used, with all of
its eleven sccnes.
A very special arrangement of
scenery is to be employed, introduc
ing the use of pivot stages whereby
ingenious effects are achieved such
as were used in "Grand Hotel."
Everyone interested is requested
to show up at the Green Room to
morrow between the hours of 1 and
4 o'clock in the afternoon,
