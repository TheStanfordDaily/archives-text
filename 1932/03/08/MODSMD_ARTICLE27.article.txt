# A 						SQUARE DEAL
## 
### 
The Masque Hall commit lee, realizing the justness of
the pleas of the outraged students, have thrown wide the
gales with the announcement that any member of the fair
st'\ without regard for age, color, nationality, occupation
or present place of residence, can preside as queen of the
hall.
Last week the committee made a rule limiting the choice
of queen to either a member of the 'MOO" or some fair dam
sel from the Mills campus. Both the women and the men
complained that this was unfair discrimination and that
the ultimate result of the rule was forcing a Mills co-ed into
the seat"of honor as the chances of a Stanford woman be
coming queen were almost negligible against such high
class compel i I ion.
Hut now the restrictions are lifted and any fair maiden
may take her seat beside the King of the roughs at the most
colorful campus dance of the year. Thus a rough running
for the kingship will not be forced to take a campus date
or a Mills girl unless he wishes to for some reason of his
own.
Although it is true that the chances of a Stanford woman
becoming queen are somewhat lessened by taking off the
restrictions, the women are placated by the thought that
women as a whole are getting a square deal and that Mills
is not set upon a pedestal to which all Stanford men should
bow down.
