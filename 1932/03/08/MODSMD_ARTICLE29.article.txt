# FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### 
II is hardly necessary to set aside a specific day lo honor
Ihe memory of Stanford's creators. The existence of Ihe
University is obvious evidence that their work is not and
will not be forgotten. Nevertheless, the annual ceremony
in observance of Founders' Day is one of the few remain
ing worthwhile traditions of the Farm, if only because il
expresses in definite form the general respect paid lo the
Stanfords by the direct beneficiaries of their generosity.
Tomorrow evening Ihe senior class will go in a body to
the Memorial Church lo acknowledge ils debt to the great
pioneers who made possible the practical, yet idealistic
education which its members have received. To enumerate
Ihe benelifs which Ihe University owes to Senator and Mrs.
Stanford would be superfluous. To attempt an adequate
appreciation would require entirely 100 much space. II is
sullieienl to say thai tomorrow's ceremonies will indicate
only in a very small way the gratitude which is felt by every
student toward those who gave their name lo Stanford.
For those who are moaning because they are 100 poor
lo make Ihe Irip home during Ihe coming spring vacation,
here is something lo think about. Yesterday a student was
seen in tears over Ihe fact that his folks had sent him a
train ticket and told him lo use it, after he had planner! to
slay on the Farm with its sun-tanning weather, its Lagu
nita, and all.
Here is Ihe announcement that you have all been wail
ing for! Due lo Ihe press of coming finals, there will be
no Daily staff meeting today. Rejoice all ye minions in
this period of grace.
