### 
IVTEW HAVEN. Conn., March 7. (/P) —Tony Meslo was arrested here today
by state police in connection with the Lindbergh case, claimed police.
He was held on a technical charge of idleness. Major I. E. Nicholls of the
state forces said: "Meslo's arrest opens up an entirely new angle 011 this
state's connection with the kidnaping case."
HOPEWELL, N.J., March 7. (A 3 ) —lnformation that tlie kidnapers of
Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., have been in communication with his
parents came tonight from an apparently authentic source.
Two notes were received Sunday by the Lindberghs. One was type
written, but handwriting experts agree the other was in the same writing
as a ransom demand left behind last Tuesday night b> the kidnapers as
Baby Safe

All these were on the same kind
' of paper. The last two bore the same
I postmark. The baby was described
! as safe and well.
The source of this information !
j supplied these details despite a con
; fusing series of public pronounce-
I ments by officials.
I From a morning state police press
| conference came denials both of the
' existence of an original ransom note
! being left by the kidnapers last
I Tuesday and of any contact with
j them since that time.
j Later, however, police said "none
j through the police" when asked if
j any communication had been estab
■ lished.
Ban Letter Opening
At the last press conference of
I the day officials made no answers
! to any questions covering these two i
| phases of the case.
Neither could confirmation or de- J
| nial be obtained at the Lindbergh |
i home.
; Tonight Governor A. Harry Moore j
j announced henceforth police will ;
j open none of the mail to the Lind- I
I bergh home, where it is known j
I every effort is being made to deal i
| with the kidnapers on the basis of |
j the three appeals made by the par- J
i ents.
; Police will see, the Governor said, j
} only those letters to the family and j
| its representatives which the Lind- |
, ! berghs and their agents desire to i
I turn over.
Demand $500,000
Meantime a letter to Colonel
Lindbergh, demanding $500,000 for
the return of the child and setting
a meeting place, was taken from the I
mail at Elmira, N.Y.
It was written in red ink, and de- !
| manded a representative of the I
Lindberghs be sent with $500,000 in j
i $20 bills wrapped in a newspaper j
i to the Cross Trail Restaurant, near j
Mansfield, Pa., tonight.
After the money had been de- j
livered, it is said, the child would j
be left at the same place.
Johnson Still Held
At Newark, N.J., Henry (Red)
; Johnson, sailor suitor of the Lind- |
bergh baby's nursemaid, was still i
being hold. What police had learned ]
from him in three days and three j
nights of questioning remained a i
i secret. >
In Bridgeport, Conn., a man told j
l police he had ridden from New >
York to Bridgeport with Johnson '
early last Wednesday. This tended
J to bear out the sailor's own story I
' of his movements.
