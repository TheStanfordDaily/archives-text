# BULL SESSION
## QUARTERLY SWAN SONG 
### 
One of the most abominable prac
tices known to a college campus is
the musings and rumblings of sen
iors. But there comes a unique
! pleasure in being consciously abom
inable once in a while. It used to
, be that we viewed each quarter as
another lap—another lap before we
would be able to leave the oval en
-1 tirely and break out into Life—with
a capital "L." And it was with ex
pectation and increasing joy that
: each lap was completed. Each Bull
; Session at the end of the quarter
then automatically became a hymn
of praise to the glories of vacation—
the evils of finals—the proximity of
both.
I Somehow, however, as the last
winter quarter of our undergradu
' ate day approaches history, the end
of the lap is not at all enjoyable.
Rather would we like to run lap
after lap—round and round the oval
—until from sheer dizziness would
we drop. Finals become especially
obnoxious—not only because they
1 are boring but because they are in
dicative of the fast-approaching end.
We race to get through these four
years—without realizing what will
face us after the four years are
completed.
At the present, the only thing that

looms to most of us are finals—re
digesting of half-learned facts with
a sufficient mastery so as to make
possible their duplication in blue
books. The glories of vacation seem
luscious and beautiful.
It is not long before we will be
eternally basking in the sunlight
reading and frisking about without
the reputed "worries" of overdue
term papers and pending examina
tions. The week or so of vacation
becomes an extended week-end —
with only a fresh beginning of a
new quarter at the end of the rain
bow—rather than fifteen chapters by
Whoosis that should have been read.
Everybody enjoys vacation, but
somehow ours this year will not be
as enjoyable as others have been—
because the startling fact of gradu
ation has become an immediate
reality rather than a distant possi
bility. Probably one reason why
college is so enjoyable is that vital
decisions rarely have to be made.
If one makes a mistake in choosing
a course, a few hours are wasted;
if one doesn't choose a course, the
mistake can be rectified next quar
ter. And, if not rectified, little actual
difference results. But with gradua
tion, one has to decide on an occu
pation which will determine the
course of years and years of living.
The weight of that selection is most
uncomfortable. We see that problem
as freshmen —but it seems so un
real; it is hidden by four years.
About now, it's very real—very
much present.

new quarter at the end of the rain
bow—rather than fifteen chapters by
Whoosis that should have been read.
Everybody enjoys vacation, but
somehow ours this year will not be
as enjoyable as others have been—
because the startling fact of gradu
ation has become an immediate
reality rather than a distant possi
bility. Probably one reason why
college is so enjoyable is that vital
decisions rarely have to be made.
If one makes a mistake in choosing
a course, a few hours are wasted;
if one doesn't choose a course, the
mistake can be rectified next quar
ter. And, if not rectified, little actual
difference results. But with gradua
tion, one has to decide on an occu
pation which will determine the
course of years and years of living.
The weight of that selection is most
uncomfortable. We see that problem
as freshmen —but it seems so un
real; it is hidden by four years.
About now, it's very real—very
much present.
Well, while we have indulged in
One of the most abominable prac
tices known to a college campus is
the musings and rumblings of sen
iors. But there comes a unique
! pleasure in being consciously abom
inable once in a while. It used to
, be that we viewed each quarter as
another lap—another lap before we
would be able to leave the oval en
-1 tirely and break out into Life—with
a capital "L." And it was with ex
pectation and increasing joy that
: each lap was completed. Each Bull
; Session at the end of the quarter
then automatically became a hymn
of praise to the glories of vacation—
the evils of finals—the proximity of
both.
I Somehow, however, as the last
winter quarter of our undergradu
' ate day approaches history, the end
of the lap is not at all enjoyable.
Rather would we like to run lap
after lap—round and round the oval
—until from sheer dizziness would
we drop. Finals become especially
obnoxious—not only because they
1 are boring but because they are in
dicative of the fast-approaching end.
We race to get through these four
years—without realizing what will
face us after the four years are
completed.
At the present, the only thing that

looms to most of us are finals—re
digesting of half-learned facts with
a sufficient mastery so as to make
possible their duplication in blue
books. The glories of vacation seem
luscious and beautiful.
It is not long before we will be
eternally basking in the sunlight
reading and frisking about without
the reputed "worries" of overdue
term papers and pending examina
tions. The week or so of vacation
becomes an extended week-end —
with only a fresh beginning of a
new quarter at the end of the rain
bow—rather than fifteen chapters by
Whoosis that should have been read.
