FOX. S.F. — Will Rogers comes
! through once more to score in a
big way at the Fox this week in
crazy comedy mixing "Business and
Pleasure" to the extent ol' almost
causing international complications.
Rogers, although indulging in a bit
too much slapstick (which he cer
tainly dees not need to resort to),
succeeds in keeping the entire
house screaming from start to finish
with his antics.
The story deals with a wealthy
American razor blade manufacturer
\ who takes the wife and daughter
with him on a "pleasure" trip to the
Far East with the secret hope of
I securing the mysterious formula and
manufacturing rights to the imper
vious Damascus steel. The idea is to
put the rival company out of busi
ness by giving, the public a better
product. Needless to say, it's a riot
! . . . . though not Rogers' best.
Walt Roesner with the Fox con
cert orchestra, has an excellent of
fering developing the history of the
dance and its music, and an un
usually good stage production
j rounds out the program. Juaquin
Garay contributes "Was That the j
Human Thing to Do?" to the fes- j
tivities. —S.B.
GRAND HOTEL—At the Geary.
The production of Vici Ba urn's |
"Grand Hotel" furnishes a memor- |
able evening at the theatre. This
play consists of eighteen scenes pre
; sented on a jack-knife stage which
reduces the time of waiting for
; scene shifts to a momentary lower
ing and raising of the curtain.
"Grand Hotel" is a psychological
presentation of a series of inter- 1
i related characters. Among them
Olga Baclonova plays the part of
j the fading dancer who finds one
night of warmth and romance by
; discovering (he Baron von Gaigern
whom she by chance interrupts in
the business of stealing her re
nowned string of pearls.
Von Gaigern, a thief and a cheat,
in the hands of lan Keith becomes
an attractive person worthy of sym
pathy, and very convincingly at
tractive to the dancer.
Numerous other guests at the ho
tel weave in and out of the scenes. !
Dr. Otternschlag, one of these "other I
guests," makes himself more or less ;
inconspicuous and observes from j
his chair in the lobby that the re- !
volving door turns" and turns—and |
swings and swings—and life goes on. j
