ABE IIABLES claims that Cotto !
Herbert won last Saturday's track
meet for Stanford over the Olympic
Club by falling down in the low j
hurdles, Charlie Smith, who was '
clearing the timbers in the next i
lane, and running in second place, j
looked over when Herbert toppled I
over one of the barriers, and lost \
his stride. The look cost him second |
place and the Olympic Club the i
meet. Maybe so, maybe so!

The cinder artists will spend their
vacation around the Farm this year,
getting ready for the L.A.A.C. meet
March 2(5. Bill Ellington is all pepped
up over the 50.2 quarter-mile which
Frank Lombardi turned in for his
week-end performance. With Hables
and Giberson already running in
late season form this does not af
fect the team's sprinting power.

IF HARRY WOLTER'S baseball
players can keep their respective
hea\; down when going after
grounders, AS WELL AS while
running bases, Stanford is likely to
pay the boys down South an inter
esting visit. The Cards lost the game
Saturday partly because one runner
insisted on gazing out to right field
to see where the ball was instead
of depending on the third base coach
to let him know, and it cost the
Indians a run. There is no reason
why the Cards shouldn't keep the
crown on the Farm this year. Here's
hoping they do! —Bob Wade
