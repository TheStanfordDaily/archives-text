# HELVENSTON DRAWS CARICATURES FOR MODERNISTIC QUAD
## 
### 
An end-quarter survey made yes
terday of the work done on the
19152 Quad reveals the progress this
year in advance of that of previous
years to be even at an increase over
the lead already piled up last quar
ter.
The artistry of the '32 annual, a
modernistic theme conceived by
Kenneth Hook, will be augmented
by caricatures by Harold Helven
ston. Helvenston will sketch the
major character of each section, the
drawings being used as section
closers. Many of the caricatures are
already finished and others are in
process of completion.
Individual photography, handled
this year by the Watson Studios of
Berkeley, has been completed, as
well as all organization group pic
tures, a few athletic groups, only,
remaining to be snapped. All action
photography for all sections is in
except that of spring dramatics, de
bating, and sports.
Football, written by Richard
Friendlich, Administration and Re
search by Jack Owen, and Profes
sor Hulme's "The Life of David
Starr Jordan" are the sections which
have been finished. The senior pic
tures and copy have also gone to
press, while most of the living
group pictures are now at the en
gravers.
The covers, to be finished by the
T. J. Cordoza Company of San
Francisco, have been chosen and are
now being made. Quad officials have
decided upon the dedication, but the
name of the dedicatee will not be
released until publication of the
book.
