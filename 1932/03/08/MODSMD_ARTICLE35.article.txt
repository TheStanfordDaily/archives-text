# Tracksters Strong In First Meet
## THREE STARS ILL BUT TEAM SHOWS SURPRISE ABILITY Field Dope Promises Win For Cardinal Javelin, Pole Vault Events

California's Golden Bear rolled
over and played dead, while Troy's
wooden horse wobbled preceptibly
on its foundations when the result
of Stanford's track victory over the
Olympic Club became known late
Saturday afternoon.
For the Indians, with three stars
on the sick list, showed strength in
every event except the two jumps
in their first meet of the year.
Those three stars, Ben Eastman,
Bill Miller, and Bert DeGroot, will
be in there trying to make up for
lost time when Dink Templeton's
track team meets the Los Angeles
Athletic Club on March 26.
Performances last Saturday show
that Williamson, U.S.C.'s sophomore
javelin sensation, is not going to
have things so easy when he meets
A1 Ray of the Cards. Ray got off a
nice toss of 197 feet to get second
behind Olympian Churchill while
Williumson's best throw in the open
meet, in which he competed meas
ured a few inches shorter than
Ray's mark.
Early season promises in the
weights have been more than vindi
cated with Bob Jones and Here
Laborde throwing the discus beyond
the 150-foot mark and John Lyman
and Nellie Gray way over 49 feet
in the shot.
Ned Johns' 13-foot vault on his
first attempt showed that Miller and
DeGroot are by no means the only
good pole-vaulters at Stanford. Two
apparent weaknesses in the dis
tances have been filled by Jim Fer
rie in the mile and George Naylon
in the 880.
