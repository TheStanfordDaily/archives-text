in Itoom 45 of the B.A.C. Building.
Bill Ellington, maestro of Stan
ford's hardy band of freshman
tracksters, has announced that his
charges will be granted a rest of
two weeks before they swing into
the season's serious campaign, with
the next meet scheduled for Satur
day, March 19. Menlo Junior Col
lege will furnish the opposition.
Although the yearlings dropped
their first two meets to the San
Francisco All-Stars and Sacramento
Junior College, the first-year run
ners feel confident they are not get
ting into the frame of mind which
has already brought repeated de
feats to freshman football, basket
ball, and baseball teams.
Brown, Harris Better
The most improved competitors in
last week's meet were Bob Brown
and Walt Harris. After taking third
to Phil Morentin in the mile, Brown
came into his own in his 440-yard
lap of the mile relay, and ran the
fastest race for the Indian quartet.
Brown will probably take a crack at
the quarter-mile event in the Menlo
meet.
Harris ran a fine second in the
880, and finished v/ith a sprint that
would have done credit to any
sprinter. Although he started his
final rush too late to catch Caus
brook of Sacramento, Harris passed
Dave Devlin as though the latter
v/as standing still.
Others Improve
Todd was barely nosed out of a
place in the 100, running 10.5, while
Joslin in the discus lost his second
consecutive discus victory by less
than a foot. This time the former
Lowell star threw the-platter 132
feet. Bill Beatty, with 16G feet, and
George Wyman, who took second
with 150, also showed good im
provement.
