# Menlo Hashers Nose Out Sigma Chi 17-15 To Win
## 
### MAURICE RAPF 
THE MENLO HASHERS defeated Sigma Chi 17-15 in the quarter-finals j
of intramural basketball play last night, but the victory was not due ,
to any brilliant performances on the part of the winners. Sig Chi's defeat j
was due (o their own failure to hit tho basket and nothing else.
With the score 17-15 against them and four minutes to go, the defend- :
ing champions took no less than six shots at the basket. Had the ball j
ever hit the mark, the score would have been tied and an extra period !
played, but the Row men had no luck and the score did not change.
The Hashers opened up the first period in last style and had a 10-0 lead
before the Sig Chi's got started. Leigliton Johnson started the ball rolling i

with a foul shot, and the count stood
at 14-10 in Menlo's favor when the
gun sounded the half.
Menlo maintained its lead in the
second period, but the Sig Chi team
was always perilously close, and al
ways playing aggressive ball. Time
and time again, the ball would start
toward the Hashers' basket, but it
never seemed to connect.
Glenn Reed, Hasher forward, was
high-point man with eight markers,
while Johnson of the losers followed
with five.
Phi Kappa Sigma won its way
into the semi-finals with a 28-19
win over Theta Chi. Fred Lindsley
and Fred Conradt kept the Phi Kaps
out in front with a safe margin
throughout most of the encounter,
although George Griffin, Theta Chi,
scored 13 points for top scoring
honors.
El Tcrfo added another name to
its growing list of victims, trounc
ing the Business School 27-12. Bob
Fisher, Toro center, again played a
starring role, scoring 14 points for
the winning team.
In tonight's semi-finals, El Toro
meets Phi Kappa Sigma in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock, with the Delta
Upsilon-Menlo Hasher game set for
an hour later. The finals between
the winners of these two encounters
