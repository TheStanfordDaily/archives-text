# Unemployed To Benefit From Registration Dance
## 
### 
Attendance at the quarterly Reg
istration Dance on March 28 should,
this time, mean an evening of dou- '
ble enjoyment.
I In addition to two big features—a
| low admission price and Fitzpat
; rick's ten-piece orchestra, there will
; be another attractive element. The
i proceeds from the affair, which is
| being sponsored by the Stanford I
j Newman Club, will be turned over
jto the Students' Emergency Em
i ployment Fund.
The dance will be given at the
| new Robie Gymnasium, and $1 per
i couple, will be the charge.
