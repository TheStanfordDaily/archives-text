success of ihe play in his interpre
tation of the part. Gantner is best
remembered for his work in "Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh," "Wings Over
Europe," "Berkeley Square," and
the Palo Alto Community Theatre
Production of "The Death of Coper
nicus."
A few of the roles are not yet
cast, and all those who are in
terested should see Helvenston at
once. He v/ill be in the Green Room
from 10 to 12 o'clock daily.
Five of Stanford's loading actors
will be seen in "Romeo and Juliet"
on April 22 in the Assembly Hall.
James Lyons will play Romeo, Peg
Randall Converse will play Juliet,
Dr. Margery Bailey will ..play the |
Nurse, James Sandoe will play \
Mercutio, and Vallejo Gantner will j
play Friar Laurence.
There will be the largest produc- .
tion of a dramatic classic that has |
been attempted for several seasons, ,
involving as it does, 25 speaking j
roles and 50 extras. "Rcmeo and i
Juliet" is primarily important for ;
the reason that it has been six years I
since Shakespeare has been pre
sented on the Stanford stage.
Unusual Selection
As well as being the first time |
in six years that Shakespeare has
been produced here, it will be the
first time that such a talented
group has been brought together j
by the Dramatic Council. "Romeo
and Juliet - ' will climax Harold Hel- 1
venston's four years here at Stan
ford as technician and director. The
setting for the play will be the first i
that Helvenston has designed for
the campus stage since last year's
Junior Opera.
All the principals have had wide
experience on the amateur stage. '
With the exception of James Lyons,
they have ali worked both in cam- ;
pus and Falo Alto Community
Theatre productions. Dr. Margery :
Bailey, who has been cast as the j
Nurse, was recently starred in "The
Silver Cord" by the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre. Peg Randall Con
verse, who will play Juliet, was
i>lso in the cast. "The Silver Cord"
scored such a hit that it v/as neces- j
sary to repeat it, and another pro- j
duction of ii is scheduled for early 1
in April.
Lyons Cast
James Lyons, who will play !
Romeo, has been a headliner on the
campus ever since his first play, j
"Wings Over Europe," in which he :
played the part of Sir Francis j
Lightfoot. As Lyons has up to now
obtained his efTect by intensity, the
part of Romeo will be something
quite new. His last appearance here
was in "Bird in Hand."
Mercutio will also be a new sort
of role for James Sandoc, as he has
up to now played nothing but chap
iter roles in Stanford productions.
Ho has been seen here in "Berkeley
Square," "Bird in Hand," and in
the last Football Gaieties.
