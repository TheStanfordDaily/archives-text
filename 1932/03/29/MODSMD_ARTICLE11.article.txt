# CARD TANKMEN NOSED OUT BY MICHIGAN TEAM
## Wolverine Splashers Take Four Firsts To Down Indians, 34-31 
### 
Stanford's quintet of tank stars;
was not quite able to hold down the j
great Michigan swimmers at Ann
Arbor last Friday and Saturday, but j
| showed plenty of real strength in
! keeping the 1932 National Collegiate
j Athletic Association championships j
| in doubt until the last event was j
i over.
The Cardinal men stood three |
little points behind Michigan at the j
end of the fracas, with Northwest- j
j ern third. Michigan netted 34 points, ]
! Stanford 31, Northwestern 21, and i
i Princeton, Rutgers, Ohio State, j
j Southern California, Navy, Minne- i
j sota, California, Illinois, Columbia, j
and Cincinnati University were all
: huddled under the nine-point mark. :
Cards Qualify
Captain Frank Booth, Austin;
j Clapp, John McKelvey, Tuppy j
■ Gardner, and Ted Wiget qualified
I no less than eight times during the j
I first day of heats, against Michi- j
j gan's six.
Clapp was the outstanding per- .
! former during this first day. He J
| started off by setting a new Ameri- !
can record in the 1500-meter dis- I
! tance, shattering Buster Crabbe's
| old mark. Clapp's time was 20 min- ;
i utes, 3.1 seconds; Wiget trailed him
for third place. Later in the day ;
j Clapp turned in the best time of all I
j qualifiers in the 440, as well as;
; qualifying for the 220.
McKelvey and Wiget came
I through for the only first places the !
I Cards captured, the former beating
I out Thompson, of the Navy, in the |
j 50-yard .sprint. Thompson is presentj
i holder of the national record in the j
i long pool. Wiget took the 440 in ,
J 4:58.6, with Clapp finishing second.)
j and Booth fourth, all of which net- |
ted Stanford not a few points.
Clapp took third in the 220, and
j Booth fourth. Gardner came in for
| his share of honors by taking fourth
| in the 100-yard free style, though
j he failed to qualify for the finals of
i the 50. The only other points gar- 1
{ nered were in the 400-yard relay,
I when the Stanford quartet forced
! Northwestern to a new national in-
I tercollegiate record of 3:36.6. This
| broke the former mark, made by the
| same Cardinal team at the Califor
! nia meet here last month.
Michigan placed in every one of
j the ten events except the 50 and
J century, while Stanford was able
J only to enter six, due to lack of
j breast stroke men and divers,
i Johnny Schmieler was the star per
{ former of the day, being the only
i double winner of the meet. He took
the 220 away from Spence, of Rut- !
gers, and Clapp and Booth, then |
turned over and won the 200-yarcl j
backstroke.
Wolverines S(ar
Michigan's collection of four first |
/daces was a little too much for the j
Cards, especially since three of these j
were in events Stanford could not i
enter. Willi one backstroker of first j
calibre, the championship coulel ,
have been pulled out of the fire ;
easily.
„ Northwestern conquered the In- j
dians on March 22 in a dual meet, ;
the final score standing 41-34. Up {
until the final event, the 400-yard j
relay, the meet was in doubt, as a j
victory in this event would have !
handed the Cards a 38-37 victory, j
The championship Northwestern 1
team was a little too strong, how- j
I ever, and won both here and at the i
nationals.

I first day of heats, against Michi- j
j gan's six.
Clapp was the outstanding per- .

| started off by setting a new Ameri- !
can record in the 1500-meter dis- I
! tance, shattering Buster Crabbe's
| old mark. Clapp's time was 20 min- ;
i utes, 3.1 seconds; Wiget trailed him

; qualifying for the 220.

I through for the only first places the !
I Cards captured, the former beating
I out Thompson, of the Navy, in the |
