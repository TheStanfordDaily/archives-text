# METAL POWDER, ENAMEL NEWEST HAIR-DRESS AIDS
## 
### 
CHICAGO. March 28. Wi—
Powdered hair in the modern
manner—colored to match the
evening fjown and enameled
(not lacquered) to hold the
ends in place—made its debut
today at the annual Midwest
beauty industry show.
As described by E. R.
Howde, Chicago hairdresser,
the colored powder, generally
elected with metalic, is put on
the hair when it is waved and
set. If the wearer desires two
colors, the crests of the waves
are tinted with a brush. Then
the head is sprayed with an
enamel and dried.
To get it out a dry cleaner is
used, he said.' ___
