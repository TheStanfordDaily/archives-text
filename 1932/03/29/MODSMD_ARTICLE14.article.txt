# IRISH ORGANIZE FASCISTI ARMY
## Nationalism Sweeps Ireland In British Crisis 
### 
DUBLIN, March 28 (/P>.â€” I To cre
ate the gravest phase of the threat
ening situation caused by the elec
tion of Eamon De Valera as presi
dent of the Irish Free State, Fascism
today found a breeding place in
Ireland.
With Great Britain determined to
make Ireland submit to the oath of
allegiance to the Empire, a nation
alistic feeling swept the Irish people.
The high council of the Irish Re
publican army announced their in
tention to form a "Green Shirt
Army" to establish a United Irish
republic.
Newly-elected President De Va
lera declined to submit to arbitra
tion or compromise. In what he
terms as an unassailable position,
De Valera will forward his note to
the cabinet for consideration tomor
row and then to England Wednes
day.
The new "Green Shirts" of the
Irish Free State form the third na
tionalistic group confronting Great
Britain. The "Black Shirt" patriots
of Burman, and the Khaki Congress
of Mahatma Gandhi complete the
t r io arrangement which has grown
from Premier Mussolini's "Black
Shirts."
