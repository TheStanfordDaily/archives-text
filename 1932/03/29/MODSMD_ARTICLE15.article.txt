# ORCHESTRA PLAYS TO HEART THROBS AS BOY EATS PIE

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 29. (/P)
—The whole United States, includ
ing San Francisco, heard Ihe heart
throbs of an actress yesterday.
In a broadcast studio at New
York City, Virginia Gardner, stage
and radio actress, leaned against an
electrical stethoscope. The rhythm
of her heart, fed through amplifiers,
was snatched away for public au
dition by a network of N.B.C. sta
tions.
So much like the beat of a drum
was the steady pulse of Miss Gard
ner's personal pump that a string
orchestra played an obbligato of
soft music to the rhythm of it.
Following the heart throb demon
stration, the network broadcast the
noise of a small boy eating pie. The
crunch of berries, the soft sosh of
juice and gurgles of delight set a
whole nation into a ferment and
drove thousands into the pantry for
a slice of the same.
The program was a part of a radio
lecture by Orestes H. Caldwell, for
mer radio commissioner, and having
to do with the technicalities of re
ception.
