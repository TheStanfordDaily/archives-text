WASHINGTON, March 28. (/P)â€”
Rain fell and chill March winds
j blew today but 11,000 youngsters
j swarmed over the White House
! lawn for the annual Easter Monday
I egg-rolling fete. It was a new low
j record for recent years, 30,000 brav
! ing weather only slightly less in
-1 clement last year and 48,000 attend
ing the year before.
White House policemen had a
j busy day, despite the small crowd,
|in restoring strayed youngsters to
j their parents. Each lost child was
j carried to the high south portico
J where all could see them, or was
| held high above the heads of the
j crowd by obliging bluecoats.
