# Eastman Out To Shatter World's Halt-Mile Mark
## Ben Hopes To Add 880-Yard Record To Quarter-Mile Mark Hung Up Saturday; Runs 46.4 Seconds To Record Fastest 440 Of All Time STRONG L.A.A.C. TEAM BEATS CARDS, 80-51 Hables Noses Out Dyer In Both Dashes; Meier Wins Lows From Herbert; Amdahl Cops Two-Mile 
### 
A TALL, scholarly magician named Ben Eastman delved into his has of
tricks late last Saturday afternoon and, before an awed audience of
<>000. came up with a stunt that may stand as a marvel of all time. With
nothing up his sleeve but a thin, flailing arm, Magician Eastman calmly,
easily, majestically raced around Stanford's historic old oval in 4(5.4
seconds to break his own, Ted Meredith's, and Vic Williams' world's
quarter-mile record by a full second and to establish himself as the
greatest middle-distance runner ever to don a pair of spiked shoes.

Yet brilliant as was Eastman's per
' i'ormance, bespectacled Ben Bangs
may himself surpass that mark be
! fore this track season is finished. At
, the present time, however, Eastman
and his coach, Dink Templeton, are
satisfied with the blond flash's '"im
possible" race and are out to break
: the world's 880-yard mark.
Should Break BXO Record
Eastman should find it as easy to
knock a mere second or so from the
! half-mile record as it was to dis
j regard the precedents and conven
tions set up in 50 years of track his
tory when he flew past the ghosts
of Maxie Long, Binga Dismond, Ted
, Meredith, Ray Barbuti, and Bud
Spencer last Saturday. The fastest
! half-mile ever recorded by a human
being traveling solely on his own
power is credited to Dr. Otto Peltzer
of German, who ran 1:51.6.
Stanford's lanky junior has al
ready negotiated two laps of the
! track within a second of Peltzer's
time. Ben may try and break the
880-yard mark in the Big Meet, and
i from now on he will be working oil
the distance as well as on sprints,
i Clubmen Too Strong
Purely incidental to Eastman's
record-breaking race was the jest
of the Stanford A.A.A.C. track meet.
The Clubmen, with the strongest
track team ever assembled by a
• single organization, defeated the
Indians 80 to 51.
Talbot of the L.A.A.C., with two
1 firsts and a third, was the day's
high-point man, although Les
Hables' victories in the sprints made
I him a close second. Gus Meier's
| suddenly acquired speed nearly took
Talbot in a 14.8 high hurdle flight
and earned him a hardy victory in
the lows. Meier barely beat Cotto
Herbert in the lows, and the show
ing of these men gives Stanford two
fine low hurdlers instead of none
! as was the case three weeks ago.
Hables Takes Dyer
Hables beat out his ex-team-mate
Hec Dyer by narrow margins in the
j two dashes, winning ihe 100 in his
usual time of 9.7 and then taking
the 220 with a strong finish in 21.4.
; Giberson was out in front in both
I races, but could get no better than
'la third in the furlong.
I Ollie Amdahl had no reverence
I for the reputations of Stanford's
Indians, Azevedo and Abersold, and
j the Club's Indians Suhu and Hallc
j juah, and ran to a gritty victory in
i the two-mile in 9:49.2. Amdahl let
! Azevedo and Suhu lead until the
last 220, when he uncorked a sprint
! that carried him to the tape.
