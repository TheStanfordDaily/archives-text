### 
World champion!
There is something complete in that title, a magic sug
gestion of the ultimate, leaving the impression that there is
nothing more to he said.
When a man has surpassed all competition to reach the
pinnacle deserving of those words, he takes his place
among those thoroughbreds who evoke the hero worship
of ;ill mankind. The iield of endeavor in which he excels
is of little signiticanec; he belongs among champions be
cause he can do one particular thing better than any other
person.
For two seasons Ben Hangs Kastman has been the hero
of Stanford track. For two seasons lie has been recognized
throughout the country as one of the brightest of the stars
of college sport.
Hut Saturday Hen stepped out of that class. He ran one
lap 011 the Old Oval in l(i. I seconds, a full second faster
than human legs had ever before carried a man over the
110-yard distance. As the linish-linc tape snapped, Hen
moved in with the select of all time whose names are en
graved on that page of life's history book bearing the cap
tion, "World Champions."
That group cannot but welcome Hen. Quiet, unassum
ing he lakes his success with a modesty so genuine that
( veil the sincere applause due him leaves him embarrassed
and a bit bewildered.
The news of Eastman's phenomenal performance was
no doubt welcomed everywhere, but nowhere so much as
in ;i room in Lane hospital, where Dink Templeton lies con
valescing from a malady which has kept him in bed tor
lour months.
Xo other thing could have brought more happiness to
1 Jink, lb* is proud of Hen.
All of Stanford is proud of them both the master coach
end his greatest protege, who Saturday graduated into the
ranks of the world's best.
