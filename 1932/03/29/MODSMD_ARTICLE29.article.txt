# A 						CRASH THAT STRIKES HOME
## 
### 
One of the automobile accidents so frequently recorded
in the columns of this paper came home to tlie Daily with a
shock yesterday afternoon. Dick Rodda, copy editor and
sports wri'ter, whose hy-line is well known to the campus
public, lies seriously injured in the Palo Alto Hospital as
the result of a crash in Menlo Park.
Similar smash-lips occur all the time; it is impossible
for those who make news gathering their avocation to take
a personal ink si in the victims ot each one, but the stall
is deeply affected this lime. Every member is hoping for
his speedy recovery, and the Daily takes this opportunity
to let Dick know that it is pulling for him all the time.
