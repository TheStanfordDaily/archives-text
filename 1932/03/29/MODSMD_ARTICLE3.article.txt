# Board Penalizes Code Violators
## Professor Takes Blame For Not Reporting Acts 
### 
One of the most severe penalties
of the kind ever meted out to honor
code violators today had been given
two men convicted of copying class
work.
One hundred hours' work at the
Convalescent Home was assigned to
each of the offenders, but no other
penalty was invoked.
An official statement issued by
Men's Council is as follows:
"The offense consisted in removing
turned-in home-work problems
from the professor's desk and copy
ing these in the back of the room
during class hours.
"Although this was cheating, but
100 hours at the Convalescent Home
and a flunk in the course were
meted cut, as the practice is so
prevalent in the school where the
offense occurred that it would be
unfair to ruthlessly enforce the
three-quarters' penalty. This action
is a warning measure and docs not
represent a deviation from the three
quarters' policy.
"The professor of the class as
sumed some responsibility for the
situation, declaring he knew of the
existence of it but took no steps to
prevent it. It has also been learned
on good authority that the two stu
dents who should have been flunked
were allowed to take the final ex
amination.
