Pan 1 lellenic, alliance of inter-sorority potentates, is in
troducing a novelty in women's rushing tactics this atter
noon. The spring rushing season, intended primarily to
introduce new women enrolled spring quarter, is to he
ollicially opened by an all-sorority tea. The new women,
Jive members from each sorority on the campus, the rush
ing captains. and junior members of Pan Hellenic will he
invited.
This change in the rushing schedule was initiated to
avoid the unnecessary expense of nine separate teas, one
at each of the houses. Also a limit on the number of women
guests from each sorority aViII prevent a How avalanche
upon the few unfortunate victims of sorority greed.
The tea is a forward step in the elimination of waste
of lime and money in the women's rushing season, and is
the beginning of a general reorganization of the present
system. Although such an all-sorority function would not
be practical in the regular winter rushing season due to the
greater number of rushees, it should set an excellent pre
cedent for Pan Hellenic action in coming spring quarters.
