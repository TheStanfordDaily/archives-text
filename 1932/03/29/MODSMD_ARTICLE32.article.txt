# BULL SESSION
## THIS IS A FARM—BUT.... 
### 
Located at various spots around
this campus are things which for
lack of better names are called
bulletin boards. In reality they are
I pieces of wood upon which are
tacked, nailed, and pasted all shapes
and sizes of paper and card-board
in various states of decay. ''Bulle- I
tin" implies something current or
at least recent —but Stanford boards
are jammed with notices which trace
in a rough way the history of the
campus from the dark, dim days of j
lost antiquity.
There is not the least order in i
these notices. No esprit de corps j
rules the posting of placards. Each j
individual feels no qualms in cover
' ing up the works of his predeces- J
| sors. And when everybody is fin
ished, then comes the Chappie with i
its monthly circulation campaign i
posters covering up everything—lhat
i.s covering everything as long as ■
their paper and thumbtacks hold i
out. Usually they have plenty of ;
both.
Now, basically the purpose of bul
letin boards is to provide space for the '
advertisement of people and things, j
But the present system merely af
fords space wherein anybody with
a piece of paper and a pencil can
i scribble something he has a faint j
hope of selling to that mythical per- !
sonage—the campus. The boards are
' such a garble of tattered papers and ,
| faded placards that no one without I
1 the research scholar's turn of mind j

would have the courage to wade
through the mess.
But what to do? The plan of any
one advocating anything is to paint
a terrible condition of blackness and
ruin—then suddenly launch forth
with the cure-all that will clear up
the disorder and ward off impending
disaster. The obvious remedy in this
case is to organize the bulletin
boards —put them on a scientific
basis. First of all, notices should be
limited to certain specified sizes.
The range should be wide enough
to give every budding advertising
genius semi-free scope; but there
should be a limit.
Then secondly, every two weeks
the janitorial force should be in
structed to tear, pry, or in any other
way remove all material from the
boards. This would keep the boards
semi-current at least. Rooms that
are no longer for rent but have al
ready deteriorated into the primeval
dust would no longer clutter up
space; typists who have long ago
died from arthritis would no longer
offer expert typing at reasonable
rates. Space for current subjects
would be increased.
If this would not keep some peo
ple from covering other people's an
nouncements, "OK" from some Uni
versity office might be required to
teach these individuals "that all that
is mine" is not the most important
thing in the world.

space; typists who have long ago
died from arthritis would no longer
offer expert typing at reasonable
rates. Space for current subjects
would be increased.

tacked, nailed, and pasted all shapes

in various states of decay. ''Bulle- I

at least recent —but Stanford boards
are jammed with notices which trace
in a rough way the history of the
campus from the dark, dim days of j
lost antiquity.
