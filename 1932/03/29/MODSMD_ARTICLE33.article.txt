AT THE WARFIRLD. San Fran
cisco.
A novel arrangement of the
rythmic St. Louis Blues and its
use as a warning signal to trap a
dangerous killer combine to aid in
making "Dancers in the Dark" a
really clever production. Miriam
Hopkins, starring with Jack Oakie,
gives an interesting portrayal of the
luscious blonde dance hall enter
tainer who reforms to walk the
straight and narrow path to the alter
with William Collier, Jr.
Hermie King and the Warfield joy
gang present what is a really clever
stage show before the footlights this
week with the assistance of the
"Three Jacks and a Queen" and a
novelty breath-taking skating act
which displays some real talent.
Saturday's mid-nite show, be
ginning at 11:30, was a riot of fun
and the extra acts were well re
ceived. For a change, some really
good numbers were shot on the
screen for the audience to sing, and
what was more, everybody sang
them. Which is a good bull-eve it
or not. S. B.

SHANGHAI EXPRESS at the New
Stanford.
"Shanghai Express" is a "Grand
Hotel" reproduced in a new setting,
with a different plot and different
characters. The lobby of the hotel
;is the first class section of the
' Shanghai Express, with the German
| background replaced by a Chinese
| setting.
Marlene Deitrich is as elusive and
fascinating as ever in her portrayal
of the duo-personality of Madeline
and "Shanghai Lil." Her co-star,
I Clive Brooks continues to be the
! same suave Englishman who won
! the campus popularity contest a
| year or so ago. With the added
! humor of Eugene Pallette the pic
i ture takes on a well-rounded
I amount of humor, drama, adventure,
and romance.
The character portrayal is excel -
| lent and the picture of Chinese life,
whether accurate or not, is most
interesting. , • •• >
.... And, believe it or not, the
shorts are really good!
