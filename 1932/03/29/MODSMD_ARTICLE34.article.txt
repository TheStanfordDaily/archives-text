The Editor, Sir:
Easter Sunday dawned clear and
beautiful, truly a splendid day for
going to church. Many people, sev
eral hundred, had the same idea
as I, and thought it would be nice
to hear inspirational music and
even listen to an Easter Sunday
sermon, and so decided to go to the
widely known Stanford Memorial
Church. Besides students and
teachers on the campus, these peo
ple came from Palo Alto, and other
Bay villages, forsaking their own
churches to attend ours. When they
arrived at the Church, instead of
being greeted by soft organ music
a sign stared them in the face in
forming them that during the school
recess there would be no services
in the Memorial Chapel. Certainly,
that was quite proper, school is

out, church is out! And so the peo
ple who had never been here before
i contented themselves with looking i
at the pictures on the wall (Stanford
Museum, No. 2), while those who
had already seen the pictures went j
to Palo Alto to stand up during the ■
usual Easter morning sermon of |
some smaii-town preacher. I was i
one of those.
The reason I am telling you this !
story is that I hope you can tell me
the reason for there being no Easter ;
service in the Chapel. I didn't know
that God took a recess at Stanford, |
especially on the anniversary of |
Christ's ascension. But I am just a
freshman who is fast learning that
many unusual things, in which the
student has no voice, happen around
here, and so I suppose I am out of
order and had better sit down.
Sincerely yours,
