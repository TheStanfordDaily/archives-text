# CHIEF BACON RIND, OSAGE TRIBE HEAD, DIES AT AGE OF 84

### 
PAWHUSKA. Okla., March 28 (JP)
â€”Chief Bacon Hind, venerable
leader of the Osage nation, has
joined his fathers.
The 84-year-old Indian died at
his home in the tribal village here
today of cancer and pneumonia.
He was one of the last of the im
perious old figures among the
American Indians who made grudg
ing concessions to the ways of white
civilization.
In later years Bacon Rind com
bined the luxuries his tribe's oil
money brought with traditional In
dian habits of life.
He was a tireless worker for his
fellow Osages during their years
of poverty in the wild hill country
that comprised the Osage reserva
tion, and their unfailing spokesman
before the Great White Father in
Washington after discovery of oil
made them wealthy.
