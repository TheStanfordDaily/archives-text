Addition of 6,000 acres of fine forest land to California's state park system, saving the ancient trees
from private exploitation, was made possible by a contribution of $500,000 made by Edward S. Harkness
of New York. The money he gave was matched by funds supplied by the park commission. Shaded area
on map shows location and extent of the new preserve. The photograph is of a typical spot in the heart
of the old trees.
