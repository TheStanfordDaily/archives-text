# EXHIBITS FEATURE PASADENA ARTISTS
## Etchings, Block Prints Of C. A. Seward Displayed 
### 
Landscapes, still lifes, and por
traits by twenty members of the j
Pasadena Society of Artists, and ;
etchings, lithographs, and block
prints by C. A. Seward of Topeka,
Kansas, are on exhibition in the j
Stanford Art Gallery.
Brilliant color and strong tech
nique characterize the work of the
Pasadena artists, and several of the
paintings in the collection have re- j
ceived prize awards and honorable
mention in this season's exhibitions.
A few are being exhibited to the
public for the first time.
A striking example of modern
brush work is the effect of light re
flected on water in Jean Mannheim's
"Celestial Radiance." Paul Starrett
Sample's marine painting, "Fish
Harbor," is an interesting and indi
vidual composition, while two por
traits by J. M. Spalding, "Sapphire"
and "Jane," are examples of the di- ,

! rect simplicity of modern portrai
-1 ture.
Orrin White's recent painting,
"Sierra Springtime," depicts the difâ€”
! ficult subject of rugged mountains
in the delicate atmosphere of spring.
H. Puthoff, an artist of recognized
1 ability, is represented in the collec
: tion by his forceful "Desert Ram
part."
Kansas landscapes and scenes in
the Southwest and Mexico are por
trayed by C. A. Seward, whose merit
j has suddenly been recognized in the
last, few years. His work has been
widely exhibited here and abroad
i and has received much praise.
Landscapes appeal to Seward
more than anything else, but he por
trays figures where the subject de
mands it, as in his drawings of
Indian pueblos and Mexican scenes,
i In his Kansas landscapes are hay
| stacks, hill tops, flying wild ducks
and geese, and especially trees. He
has the plainsman's love of trees in
[ a country where there are few.
