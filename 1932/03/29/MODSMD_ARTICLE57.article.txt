# RED-BLOODED STANFORD ROUGH RETURNING Book Stores Note Swing From Poetry To Mysteries CARDINAL WOMEN PREFER LOVE STORIES
## 
### RALPH MALLOCH 
The Stanford Rough—that hairy
chested specimen of red-corpuscled
manhood—may once again be a fre
quent sigh on the campus, if facts
unearthed yesterday indicate cor
rectly.
Of late years almost extinct, the
J tough has become a rarity on a
Quad populated with a specie which
wears tie-pins, garters, and clean
cords.
The news, which should delight
the co-ed who likes her man rough
and tough, comes from the Stanford
and Palo Alio Bookstores. Books of
poetry, which until a year ago were
bought eagerly by Stanford men, arc
now as difficult to sell as last year's
birds'-nests. There is still hope
when bookstores report a shift in
popularity from Edna St. Vincent
Millay to S. S. Van Dyne.
It was also ascertained that the

'well-known little girl who used to
read love stories concealed behind v
| her geography book in grammar )
I school is now a member of the Five |
Hundred. The bookstory: report
that when the Stanford woman buys
a book, she gets a classic, but when
it comes to borrowing a book from
the lending library, mushy love j
j stories are the favorite choice.
Best sellers are worst sellers on
the campus, it was found. Stanford
ites are uninfluenced by standard '
I
advertising, and do not buy the !
j generally-popular books. j
On the whole, Cardinals buy non
-1 fiction rather than fiction, the men
j showing preference for mystery and
! detective yarns, and during the last
! month, Russia and Communism.
The stores report an especially big
j business in light fiction at the lir.it 1
| of the quarter and during examina- I
! tion time. !
