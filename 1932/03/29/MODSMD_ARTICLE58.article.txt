# Find Method To Measure Molecular Atmospheres
## 
### 
Discovery of a method to measure
the world's tiniest atmospheres,
vapors so tenuous they have only
two dimensions, were reported to
(he American Chemical Society to
day by Dr. Irving Langmuir.
These atmospheres surround single
molecules and serve as bonds for
1 icing together new chemicals of
all sorts, including medicines,
metals, and fabrics. Explanation of
their mechanism is one of the long
sought keys to scientific progress in
chemistry, and Dr. Langmuir is in
ternationally famous for this sort
of discovery.
