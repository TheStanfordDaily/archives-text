## DEFEAT TROJANS 12-11 IN FIRST BUT LOSE SECOND 19-1 Stanford Divides Ten Home Runs To Beat Bruins 26-20; Lose 15-12 
### Bob Wade 
Invading the south for a pair of
games with both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
during (he past week, Stanford's
varsity bri-eball team cut its chances
of retaining last year's title almost
to a rcglij-.able quantity by dropping
one cunu to each opponent.
From the first game with U.S.C.,
■which the Indians won by a 12-11
score, to the last with U.C.L.A.,
which the Bruins won 15-12, the
Cardinal chuckers were hit hard.
They allowed an average of approxi
mately 17 hits a game. And some
thing like lis runs were scored off
them in the four games played.
Buchanan Beaten
Stanford opened the Trojan series
like a championship club, driving
Buchanan to the showers in an in
ning and a half. By the end of the
fourth Ihe% were enjoying a 9-1
lead. But the boys from the Farm
are nothing if not courteous and by
the end of the seventh frame S.C.
had piled up an 11-9 lead. The
Cards came back to score three more,
in the eighth and sew up the con
test. Phi'ippi's homeland Gold
mann's ti ip!e featured the Cardinal
attack.
Although Anderson blew up in the
fourth and had to be replaced by
Estes, he received credit for the win.
The second game was all U.S.C.
Caddel and Stark shared the pitch
ing chores and neither was effective.
The Trojans started off with nine
runs in the first three innings and
kept it u'j to emerge on the long
end of a 19-1 score. Buchanan came
back to avenge himself for the pre
vious day's beating, and limited the
Indians to five well-scattered hits.
Goldmann Stars
Little "Lefty" Goldmann provided
the feature of the game, however,
when with two men on base, tv/o
out, and four runs already in, he
raced deep into left-center field to
take Arbelbide's fly with a stabbing
back-hand catch that had the crowd
on its feet for five minutes. Each
time after that that the blond sopho
more came to bat he drew a big
hand from the fans.
The first game with U.C.L.A. was
played in a high wind that made
judging flies almost impossible. Once
more the pitching was nothing to
cheer anybody. There were a mere
10 home runs, a triple, and three
or four doubles. The four-base
blows were evenly divided, with
Philippi of Stanford and Decker of
U.C.L.A. getting two each.
For the third game in succession
the Stanford infield tossed the base
balls around as if they were hot
livets or strong purple onions. It
may be true that the infields en
countered do not measure up to the
standard set by the campus field, but
the Trojans and Bruins were playing
on the same bumps.
Anderson received credit for an
other victory, 26-20, but failed to
look impressive in hanging it up.
Bruins Take Second
Stanford went into the second J
game with just about the same weak
Attack that they displayed in the
other games. Bill Winter, who had a
record of three straight wins, helel
the Indians nicely in check while
his mates were blasting Estes for a
substantial lead.
The Bruin coach sent in Rose in j
the seventh, anel the Indians hopped i
on him for eight runs, and almost !
tied the game up. Inability to hit '
in the pinches and a steady succes
sion of errors cost Stanford another
ball game.
The Indians are now holding down
filth place on the Conference stairs
with live victories anel five defeats. '

Estes, he received credit for the win.
The second game was all U.S.C.
Caddel and Stark shared the pitch
ing chores and neither was effective.
The Trojans started off with nine
runs in the first three innings and
kept it u'j to emerge on the long
end of a 19-1 score. Buchanan came
back to avenge himself for the pre
vious day's beating, and limited the
Indians to five well-scattered hits.
Goldmann Stars
Little "Lefty" Goldmann provided
the feature of the game, however,
when with two men on base, tv/o
out, and four runs already in, he
raced deep into left-center field to
take Arbelbide's fly with a stabbing
back-hand catch that had the crowd
on its feet for five minutes. Each
time after that that the blond sopho
more came to bat he drew a big
hand from the fans.
The first game with U.C.L.A. was
played in a high wind that made
judging flies almost impossible. Once
more the pitching was nothing to
cheer anybody. There were a mere
10 home runs, a triple, and three
or four doubles. The four-base
blows were evenly divided, with
Philippi of Stanford and Decker of
U.C.L.A. getting two each.
For the third game in succession
the Stanford infield tossed the base
balls around as if they were hot
livets or strong purple onions. It
may be true that the infields en
countered do not measure up to the
standard set by the campus field, but
the Trojans and Bruins were playing
on the same bumps.
Anderson received credit for an
other victory, 26-20, but failed to
look impressive in hanging it up.
Bruins Take Second
Stanford went into the second J
game with just about the same weak
Attack that they displayed in the
other games. Bill Winter, who had a
record of three straight wins, helel
the Indians nicely in check while
his mates were blasting Estes for a
substantial lead.
The Bruin coach sent in Rose in j
the seventh, anel the Indians hopped i
on him for eight runs, and almost !
tied the game up. Inability to hit '
in the pinches and a steady succes
sion of errors cost Stanford another
ball game.
The Indians are now holding down
filth place on the Conference stairs
with live victories anel five defeats. '
Invading the south for a pair of
games with both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
during (he past week, Stanford's
varsity bri-eball team cut its chances
of retaining last year's title almost
to a rcglij-.able quantity by dropping
one cunu to each opponent.
From the first game with U.S.C.,
■which the Indians won by a 12-11
score, to the last with U.C.L.A.,
which the Bruins won 15-12, the
Cardinal chuckers were hit hard.
They allowed an average of approxi
mately 17 hits a game. And some
thing like lis runs were scored off
them in the four games played.
Buchanan Beaten
Stanford opened the Trojan series
like a championship club, driving
Buchanan to the showers in an in
ning and a half. By the end of the
fourth Ihe% were enjoying a 9-1
lead. But the boys from the Farm
are nothing if not courteous and by
the end of the seventh frame S.C.
had piled up an 11-9 lead. The
Cards came back to score three more,
in the eighth and sew up the con
test. Phi'ippi's homeland Gold
mann's ti ip!e featured the Cardinal
attack.

Estes, he received credit for the win.
