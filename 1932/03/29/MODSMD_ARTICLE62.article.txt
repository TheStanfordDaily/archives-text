# POLO PRACTICE HELD UP TWO WEEKS BY ILLNESS OF PONIES
## 
### 
With tho ponies still convalescing j
from a general inoculation against j
a skin infection, it will be at least |
two weeks before the Cardinal polo- !
ists can swing into any intensive t
practice. .
Handicapped by this loss of prac- i
lice, Captain Gordan, polo mentor, j
hesitates to predict the prospects for j
a winning team this spring. The ;
.stellar quartet .made up of Gillham, ;
1 ewis, Spalding, and Fleming will
all be eligible for play again, and ;
should be able to reach the stride :
they hit in beating the Arizona
Wildcats at Tuscon last month.
Because of the poor condition of j
the ponies no immediate matches ;
have been scheduled. The only defi- '
nite game is that with Oregon State j
sometime during the quarter. 1
Matches with peninsula teams will
probably be arranged sometime in
the future.
