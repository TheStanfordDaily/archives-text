When Ren Eastman crashed across
the finish line at the climax of the
440-yard run in the L.A.A.C. meet
last Saturday in the amazing time
of 46.4 seconds, he also crashed a
record of 16 years' standing (hat was
set up by Ted Meredith in 1915.
Meredith's mark of 47.4 was un
touchable until last year when both
Eastman and Vic Williams of U.S.C.
equalled it on different occasions.
