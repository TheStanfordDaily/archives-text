# TEMPLETON HEARS WORLD RECORD 440 OVER DIRECT WIRE
## 
### 
How the good news was brought
from the Stanford track oval to
Dink Templeton in the hospital
when Big Ben Eastman cracked the
world's mark in the 440 is an inter- j
esting sidelight which has been un
covered. George Davis put in the
call to Dink. "Holy Smoke, it's 46.4!"
were his famous last words. Tem- i
dropped the receiver and j
hollered "46.4!" Well, that was !
enough. It electrified 6000 spectators
who had gathered to see the Phar ,
Lap of the college boys do his stuff, j
Stanford authorities, feeling that
Eastman wc-uld probably pull a cat
out of the bag, took every precau- :
tion to comply with all the rules re- :
garding official competition and i
timing. The track was measured to
440 yards and 3 niches, a wind
gauge was placed on the field show
ing a two-mile zephyr (and not a '
zither), timepieces were checked!
and double-checked, and not only |*
did the official timepieces catch the j
time, but several unofficial dockers J
verified the record. The stop watches j
have since been checked by J. Jay j
Baker, Palo Alio jeweler, and not j
even a tenth of a second has been
disputed.
Was this shattering record an ac- i
cident? Not if you ask your Uncle j
Dudley. He'il tell you that the !
"Stanford Flier" came back a little ;
later after his spectacular perform- j
ance and ran another quarter around j
tu turns in 46.7. Besides that, on j
Saturday he was clocked for the j
220 in 21.2, which means that East- I
man wasn't carried along in a gale j
of heifer dust.
