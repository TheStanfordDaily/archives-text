IT WASN'T exactly a surprise, j
Everybody had been expecting him
to do it sooner or later. But to take
a full second off a world's record
which had stood for 10 years was
SOME achievement even for a Ben
Eastman.
Just 40.4 seconds did it take Ben
Biings to steam around the Old
Oval Saturday in the Los Angeles i
Athletic Club meet to smash the
47.4 mark set for the quarter-mile
by Ted Meredith way back in 1916
—and so easily did Ben Bangs ac
complish the feat that Dink Temple
ton is already gassing about the
possibility of a 45.9 murk.
But hardly had the timekeepers
snapped' their watches at 46.4 than
friends of Ben began saying, "Now
for the 880."
IF ANY slight doubt existed
over Ben's ability to crack the
440 record, there is even less
concerning his chances to smash
tlie half-mile mark.
It was just a year ago this
week that a few of us had the
good fortune to see the blond
ace take his first serious ISing
at the half-mile event. lie had
tried the two-lap run on only
one other occasion, and with no
startling result.
Dink started Fullenwider out
15 yards ahead of Eastman, but
Ben caught him on the back
stretch of the second lap, was
in the lead at the turn, started
to "tie up" but came out of it,
and then turned on the power.
He crossed the finish line an
other 15 yards ahead of Fullen
wider.
The handful of spectators
made a rush for the timers, and
let out a whoop as the time of
1:52.(5 was announced.
NOW THAT time was just one
second slower than the German,
Otto Peltzer, had run the race in
setting the world record. And this
was only the second time that Ben
had run the distance in his life.
On only one occasion last year did
Eastman run the 880 without hav
ing already competed in the one
lap event, but on that one occasion
he set a new P.A.A. lecord of 1:53
on a track which was little better ,
than a mudhole.
Now if Een has no more regard
for a second in the quarter-mile
than he showed Saturday, there is
no telling what he will do to that
half-mile record when he gets a
chance to cut loose—Dink thinks he
will get down to 1:50!
Just incidentally, Eastman's per- 1
formance should indicate something
or other concerning the old East- |
man-Williams controversy.
EFN BANG is not the only
runner attracting attention in
these parts. Not by a darn sight.
['liar Lap, the great Australian
thoroughbred who not only cap
tured the $50,000 Agua Caliente
handicap iast week but did a
little record-smashing of his
own in his first start in North
America, is quartered at the
Perry stables at Menlo Park.
A small crowd gathered there
yesterday afternoon to see the
famed Phar Lap work out, but a
leg injury sustained in the
Mexican race postponed his ap
pearance until today, at least. I
He still had a poultice on the
injury.
If the Australian champion
makes an appearance tris after
noon. it will be at 3 o'clock on
the Perry track, which is lo
cated just west of the highway
on Isabel avenue, Menio Park.
