# 'POP' OPENS 1932 GRID PRACTICE
## 
### 
Pigskin days hit the Farm this j
week when spring football practice J
opens here Wednesday afternoon for j
the 1932 Cardinal varsity. Accord- ;
ing to reports last evening, over 90
men had signed up for competition
this season. More are expected a:;
registration continues today.
Coach Warner, getting things j
ready to start off promptly at 4
o'clock Wednesday, asks that all j
men who expect to try out for next j
fall's team appear at that time for j
practice unless they are busy with
same other sport. According to
"Pop," it is hard for the coaching ,
staff to get a line on new men I
turning out during the fall season |
for the first time and when only '
two weeks' practice are to be had
before the first game.
Rumors that the famous Ernie j
Nevers will be an addition to the j
local staff were temporarily stopped j
by the Old Fox with the statement '
that "It's all up to the Board." And
the Board of Athletic Control meet;- :
on April 10. so Nevers fans will |
have to wait until then.
Although the Indian has suffered I
considerably from loss of last year s ,
letter men through graduation, the i
preliminary sign-ups show at least !
two good elevens. Among those who ;
will answer "here" at Wednesday's !
roll call are Kenny Afflerbaugh, j
Phil Wilson, Dusty Allen, Jacx Hill- j
man, Red Gribben, Nellie 'Grey, j
Dave Packard, Don Colvin, Bill â– 
Doub, Corbus, Tarver, Bates, Kite, :
and Millig&n.
