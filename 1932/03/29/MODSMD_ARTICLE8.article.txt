NEW YORK, March 23. (/Piâ€”'The
Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America termed the Ro
man Catholic attitude toward in
termarriage of Protestants and i
Catholics "intolerable."
The council's committee on mar- I
riage and the home advised Protes
tants not to enter into such mar- i
riages.
In making public the committee's \
conclusions, tho council said it "re- I
frains from making any attack upon |
the Roman Catholic church, but in i
good temper takes issue with its j
position on mixed marriages, on the j
ground that it is intolerable."
The committee protested specifi- .
cally against ''the requirement by j
any church that the children of J
mixed marriages should be pledged j
to that church.
Mixed marriages should not be j
undertaken, the committee held, |
where "intolerable conditions are :
imposed by either church."
