# BABE TRACKSTERS MEET ALL-STARS IN NEXT CONTEST
## Little Big Meet Promises Close Battles In All Track Events 
### Aubert Guerard, Jr 
Stanford track fans, after a hectic
week-end featured by some pretty
fair running on the part of one Ben
Eastman, will have to be contented
with more meagre fare next Satur
day as a track meet between Bill
Ellington's freshmen and the Ala
meda County All-Stars headline the
campus sports program.
With tin* freshman season more
than over, and defeats at the
hands of the San Francisco All-
Stars and Sacramento Junior Col
lege as the reward for their efforts
in their only meets to date, the
yearling would-be-Eastmans are
gritting their teeth and polishing
their spikes with the intention of
inflicting a real defeat on the prep
athletes from Oakland, Alameda,
Berkeley, and way points. The meet
will furnish the prophesying experts
with their only chance to size up
the chances of the two rival teams
in the coming Stanford-California
freshman Little Big Meet, as the
Bear Cubs defeated the Alameda
aggregation by a close score re
cently.
Meet Called Off
Several of the freshman track
sters remained on the campus over
ihe vacation, as a meet with the
Menlo Junior College was sched
uled for March 19, but the old
maestro (Ellington) decided that it
would be wise to call off the meet
when he found only a smattering
of athletes Saturday morning.
A1 Blackman is still the best Stan
ford sprinter, but he's going to have
to run the race of his life to beat
out Dick Branting, Bear star, in the
100. Since the Bears are weak in
the 220, Ellington will probably do
some tall hunting during the next
week or ;-o, to find some Stanford
men who can take a second or third
in this event, and add to Blackmail's
almost certain five points.
Brown Tries 440
At that Blackman would come in
mighty handy in the 440 event, as
the tall Indian sprinter could come
close to 50 seconds. But without
Blackman, Stanford will depend on
Ward Vincent or Bob Brown to beat
out Dalton. Gill (the sixth), and
Thompson of the Bears. Brown is a
crackerjack miler, holding the
northern California private school
record in this event, but he is also
one of the best quarter-milers on
the freshman squad.
Brown will probably try the 440
in the Alameda meet, and if he does
he will have to go close to 52 flat
to beaf out Stallard of Oakland
Tech and Vincent. George Down
ing has been crowding Walt Harris
and Dave Devlin for half-mile hon
ors lately, and showed some real
improvement over the vacation.
Since Devlin will no doubt run the
two-mile against California, Down
ing and Harris, along with Underhill
and Girvin, will have the job of
beating out Mills, Bear half-miler.
Morentin Classy
Phil Morentin is still way ahead
of any of the other frosh milers, but
he'll have to come close to his best
high-school time of 4:31 to beat Al
bert of California. In the Little Big
Meet Bowles vs. Kindt and Munro
vs. McVay is the lineup for the
hurdle events, and a real battle
looms in both the high and low
sticks.
Tom Sales and George Wyman
have shown good improvement in
the javelin, although John Beatty
is still the best spear-tosser of the
lot. All three should be throwing
ICO feet by the end of the season.
Lory Rothert in the pole vault,
Lloyd Schween in the high jump,
and Peters in the broad jump, are
still leading freshman prospects in
these events.

ing and Harris, along with Underhill
and Girvin, will have the job of
beating out Mills, Bear half-miler.
Morentin Classy
Phil Morentin is still way ahead
of any of the other frosh milers, but
he'll have to come close to his best
high-school time of 4:31 to beat Al
bert of California. In the Little Big
Meet Bowles vs. Kindt and Munro
vs. McVay is the lineup for the
hurdle events, and a real battle
looms in both the high and low
sticks.
Tom Sales and George Wyman
have shown good improvement in
the javelin, although John Beatty
is still the best spear-tosser of the
lot. All three should be throwing
ICO feet by the end of the season.
Lory Rothert in the pole vault,
Lloyd Schween in the high jump,
and Peters in the broad jump, are
still leading freshman prospects in
these events.
Stanford track fans, after a hectic
week-end featured by some pretty
fair running on the part of one Ben
Eastman, will have to be contented
with more meagre fare next Satur
day as a track meet between Bill
Ellington's freshmen and the Ala
meda County All-Stars headline the
campus sports program.
With tin* freshman season more
than over, and defeats at the
hands of the San Francisco All-
Stars and Sacramento Junior Col
lege as the reward for their efforts
in their only meets to date, the
yearling would-be-Eastmans are
gritting their teeth and polishing
their spikes with the intention of
inflicting a real defeat on the prep
athletes from Oakland, Alameda,
Berkeley, and way points. The meet
will furnish the prophesying experts
with their only chance to size up
the chances of the two rival teams
in the coming Stanford-California
freshman Little Big Meet, as the
Bear Cubs defeated the Alameda
aggregation by a close score re
cently.
Meet Called Off
Several of the freshman track
sters remained on the campus over
ihe vacation, as a meet with the
Menlo Junior College was sched
uled for March 19, but the old
maestro (Ellington) decided that it
would be wise to call off the meet
when he found only a smattering
of athletes Saturday morning.
A1 Blackman is still the best Stan
ford sprinter, but he's going to have
to run the race of his life to beat
out Dick Branting, Bear star, in the
100. Since the Bears are weak in
the 220, Ellington will probably do
some tall hunting during the next
week or ;-o, to find some Stanford
men who can take a second or third
in this event, and add to Blackmail's
almost certain five points.
Brown Tries 440
At that Blackman would come in
mighty handy in the 440 event, as
the tall Indian sprinter could come
close to 50 seconds. But without
Blackman, Stanford will depend on
Ward Vincent or Bob Brown to beat
out Dalton. Gill (the sixth), and
Thompson of the Bears. Brown is a
crackerjack miler, holding the
northern California private school
record in this event, but he is also
one of the best quarter-milers on
the freshman squad.
Brown will probably try the 440
in the Alameda meet, and if he does
he will have to go close to 52 flat
to beaf out Stallard of Oakland
Tech and Vincent. George Down
ing has been crowding Walt Harris
and Dave Devlin for half-mile hon
ors lately, and showed some real
improvement over the vacation.
Since Devlin will no doubt run the
two-mile against California, Down
ing and Harris, along with Underhill
and Girvin, will have the job of
beating out Mills, Bear half-miler.
