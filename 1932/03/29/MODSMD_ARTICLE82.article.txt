### 
WASHINGTON, March 28 (/P).â€”
A new political term was coined in
the Senate today by Senator Van
denberg who characterized Demo-
I crats who vote for specific tariff
I rates but oppose the protective tariff
i theory as "hitch hikers."
"Democratic hitch hikers," the
: Michigan Republican said, are those
I "who attach themselves to a Re
, publican measure to get protection
for their own products and then
i thunder at the bill as a whole.
I "Hitch hikers," he added, "always
are dangerous passengers, liable to
\ assault you, sue for damages and
i contribute nothing except their dead
j weight."
