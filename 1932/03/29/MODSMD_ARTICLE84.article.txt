# ALBERT GUERARD EXPRESSES VIEWS ON WORLD PEACE
## Mutual Hatred Of France And Germany Keeps World On Edge 
### 
That the reconciliation between
Germany and France is not only
necessary for world peace, but also
possibile, is the doctrine set l'orth by
Albert Guerard, Professor of Gen
eral Literature, in an article on
"France vs. Germany" appearing in
the North American Pieview for
March.
Professor Guerard emphasizes the
fact that there is no unextinguish
able hatred between the two na
tions, only a misunderstanding pre
vailing among extremists on both
sides. Although there are unques
tionably disputes existing which are
potential war material, the author
insists that the leaders are reason
able enough men to get rid of
suspicion and further a will of re
conciliation instead.
Expounding the well-known doc
trine that the Treaty of Versailles
is an unholy peace which is doing
more harm than good, Professor
Guerard follows a new line of at
tack in showing that the poison is
being eliminated by slow change in
whittling off something from the re
parations every few years. However
lie still maintains that quarrels re
main unsettled which if stirred
up would inevitably bring about
strained relations, if not war.
The part of the United States in
assuming responsibility for the pay
ment of reparations is pointed out,
with the remark there is no longer
a Franco-German problem: it is now
a triangular problem whose solution
is within easy reach by means of
simply chucking it overboard.
Professor Guerard has another
article on Ihe same subject appear
ing in Scribner's for March.
