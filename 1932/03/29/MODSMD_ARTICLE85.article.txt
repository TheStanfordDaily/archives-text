# PARTY LINES FORM FOR NEW DRIVE TO BALANCE BUDGETS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 28. (/Piâ€”
The revolt that raged in the House
over the revenue bill for two weeks
began crumbling today and the
steadying influence of party leader
ship was seen in a determined drive
for a measure that will balance the
budget.
Speaker Garner and Representa
tive Snell of New York, the Repub
lican leader, have realigned a ma
jority of their forces despite the last
week and caused the defeat of the
sales tax proposal.
Taking an unusual course for a
speaker, Garner plans to go on the
floor tomorrow to urge his col
leagues to approve a bill that will
meet the prospective treasury
deficit.
