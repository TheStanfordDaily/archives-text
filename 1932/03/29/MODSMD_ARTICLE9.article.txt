WASHINGTON. March 28 (£').—
An insistent demand for a duty on :
copper was injected today into the i
Senate's debate over the Demo
cratic bill to revoke the President's
power to change tariff rates.
Senator Vandenberg (Republican, !

for a tariff on copper "as a matter
of life and death" and told the Sen
ate "it would be nothing short of 1
criminal neglect for Congress to ad- j
journ" without providing for it.
