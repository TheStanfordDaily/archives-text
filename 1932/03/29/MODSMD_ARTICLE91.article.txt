# CAMPUS COW BIDS TO BEAT MILK RECORD Old Brewery Once Goal Of August Faculty Cyclists PRIZE BOVINES INHABIT STANFORD WINERY
## 
### 
Once again Senator Stanford's
; old, red brick winery has become |
a dairy. Where the juice of the j
j grape was fermented some fifty
I sleek, fat Guernsey cows now give j
j forth milk to satisfy the more sub- I
! dued tastes of the day.
Along roads leading to the winery, j
where in the early days of the Uni
versity faculty members and stu-
I dents trudged or pedaled on their
i way to sample and perhaps buy
| some of the wine, milk trucks now
! rattle.
Within the walls of iho old build
ing. now covered with a light yellow
j stucco, the vats of rare wines have
| been replaced by another class of \
' prize-winners. Among these new 1
I inhabitants is Troutmere Ethel May,
| whose mother, Topsy of Thousand
' Springs, is the world's champion
I Guernsey milk producer. Although
her mother has produced 22,000
j pounds of milk within one year,
Ethel May bids fair to surpass the
record. She has given as much as
2300 pounds in a month. Among the
j younger of the bovine celebrities is |
i Troutmere Margie, holder of the !
State of California FF class record. ;
Rivaling the much-battered and j
worn Encina bull pen are five new, 1
solidly built bull pens in the rear!
of the winery.
The winery was built in the late
' seventies and was operated as .such

until the opening of the present
century. In 1915 it was leased to
the Palo Alto Stock Farm, a dairy
company. After a few years the
building was converted into a store
house for farm equipment. The
present owner, the Troutmere
Guernsey Farm, plans to operate
the establishment in conjunction
with the Home Dairy at La Honda.
In addition to the reconstruction of
the original building a dairy house
has been erected.
The campus Winchell reports that
in the old days, when men were
men and professors hadn't heard
that demon rum destroys the brain
tissue, the august members of' the
faculty could be seen riding in from
the winery with a gallon jar bal
anced on both sides of the handle
bars of their bicycles.

' Springs, is the world's champion
I Guernsey milk producer. Although
her mother has produced 22,000
j pounds of milk within one year,
Ethel May bids fair to surpass the
record. She has given as much as
2300 pounds in a month. Among the
j younger of the bovine celebrities is |

State of California FF class record. ;
Rivaling the much-battered and j
worn Encina bull pen are five new, 1
solidly built bull pens in the rear!
of the winery.
The winery was built in the late
' seventies and was operated as .such

until the opening of the present
century. In 1915 it was leased to
the Palo Alto Stock Farm, a dairy
company. After a few years the
building was converted into a store
house for farm equipment. The
present owner, the Troutmere
Guernsey Farm, plans to operate
the establishment in conjunction
with the Home Dairy at La Honda.
In addition to the reconstruction of
the original building a dairy house
has been erected.
The campus Winchell reports that
in the old days, when men were
men and professors hadn't heard
that demon rum destroys the brain
tissue, the august members of' the
faculty could be seen riding in from
the winery with a gallon jar bal
anced on both sides of the handle
bars of their bicycles.
Once again Senator Stanford's
; old, red brick winery has become |
a dairy. Where the juice of the j
j grape was fermented some fifty
I sleek, fat Guernsey cows now give j
j forth milk to satisfy the more sub- I
! dued tastes of the day.
Along roads leading to the winery, j
where in the early days of the Uni
versity faculty members and stu-
I dents trudged or pedaled on their
i way to sample and perhaps buy
| some of the wine, milk trucks now
! rattle.
Within the walls of iho old build
ing. now covered with a light yellow
j stucco, the vats of rare wines have
