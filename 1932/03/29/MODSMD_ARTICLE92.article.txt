# Modern Paul Reveres To Greet Dawn Daily
## 
### 
For those equestrians who don't
mind rolling out at dawn, Captain
Richard Gordan has organized a
class in jumping which meets five
days a week at 8 o'clock. No credit
will be given for the course, which
includes elementary training in the
art of riding sometimes obstinate
mounts over three-foot hurdles.
Only those who are R.O.T.C. stu
dents may enroll, Gordan said. It
will not be necessary to sign up for
the whole five days, but in order
to get much benefit from the class,
the student should attend at least
twice a week. Since there are only
a comparatively small number of
mounts available for this work, it is
advisable to sign up at once with
Captain Gordan.
