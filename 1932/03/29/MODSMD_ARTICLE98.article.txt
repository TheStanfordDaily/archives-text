CAPE TOWN, Union of South
; Africa, March 28 (JP). â€”J. A. Molli
son, flying to a new speed record
from London to Cape Town, cracked
up his plane in landing on the beach
here this evening, but he was not
injured.
| Mollison finished the flight in four
, days, seventeen hours and nineteen
minutes, traveling over a new route
which took him across the Sahara
Desert and down the African west
coast. He had slept very little on
the way and he said the bad landing
was because, in his weariness, he had
; miscalculated his distance.
