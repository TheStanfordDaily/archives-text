## Masque Ball Voting Begins April 6; Ballots Cost One Cent Apiece CANDIDATES SELECTED Costumes For Rent During Week Preceding 
### 
Ye Masque Ball may elect ye
Kampus King, but whispers from
the gallery point to the monarch's
choice of mate for the evening as a
determining factor in his election
this spring, following announce
ments to this effect from Rally
Committee headquarters last night.
Balloting for monarchical honors
begins April 6 on the Women's
Steps, opposite the Library, and all
candidates must reveal their choice
of Queen before placing themselves
on the ticket, according to Chairman
Ed Boyles. Throwing the lield open
to all comers, restrictions have been
removed and the Queen of the Ball
may hail from any part of the
globe—known or unknown.
Celebrities Interviewed
Interviews with local celebrities
who have already declared their
candidacy produced the following
statements:
Our Scout Brown—"There is only
one more world for me to conquer."
Rush -or - Hike Cordry — '"My
queen is ANYONE but a Pi Phi!"
All-Red Hands—"l stand firmly
for protection of home industri . . .
er girls!"
Chuckling Prelsnik—"l know a
peachy girl at Castilleja . . . !"
Price of bids for the affair has
been definitely set at $2.00 per cou
ple, it was announced. Twenty-five
votes will be given free with each
bid, and these may be placed on any
candidate, even to the point of split
ting them up among several. The
best orchestra available has been
promised the campus waltzers and
the name will be disclosed early
next week.
A Cent a Vote
Votes will be sold on all school
days between April 6 and 13, and
will be sold at one cent each, with
no limit set on the number avail
able. Plenty of ready cash is all
that is necessary. However, in order
to nominate a candidate, a bid must
be purchased to place his name on
the balloting list.
Because of the fact that the pros
pective king will have already an
nounced his choice of Queen, the
campus will in reality have the
chance to vote for popular feminine
beauties as well as the powerful
Rough. A simple plurality is all that
is required to win.
Costumes on Sale
Costumes for rent at reasonable
rates will be on display at the Pa
vilion from Monday to Friday, April
31-15, during the week preceding
the event, which will be held Friday
evening, April 15, in the Pavilion.
Blake and Amber are handling the
novel disguises.
Pennies are already beginning to
jingle on the Quad; it won't be long
at all, now. And, as a gentle re
minder, ALL proceeds are to go to
the benefit of the Convalescent
Home, so the more money the
better.
