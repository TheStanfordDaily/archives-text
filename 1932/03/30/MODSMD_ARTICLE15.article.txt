and having in its cast four other
campus actors, will be repeated Sat

School Auditorium.
Dr. Bailey, prominent member of
the faculty of the English Depart

production of "Romeo and Juliet,"
and also appeared here in "The

The complete cast of "The Silver
Cord" is as follows:
Mrs. Phelps Margery Bailey

Maid Vivienne Church
Peg Randall Converse has recent
ly been cast as Juliet in the Shake
spearian tragedy. Robert Brauns,
Vivienne Church, and Richard Ogg
are also well known locally.
"The Silver Cord" is a comedy
whose whole effect is so harsh as
to be serious, telling of the struggle
of a mother to dominate her two
sons. It was first given by the Com
munity Theatre on February 15, and
depeated on the next night.
The coming production of "The
Silver Cord" should benefit greatly
by a larger auditorium and more
rehearsals.
