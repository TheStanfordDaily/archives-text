# Fate Of Fraternity Pledging Dependent On Council Decision
## Members Search For Plan To Rescind Board Action; Committee Appointed To Work Out Tenable Penalties Other Than Financial 
### 
HE Intcrfratcrnity Council will present its case against the action of
the Board of Control, which deferred rushing of the Class of I!MS
until next fall quarter, at its meeting at X o'clock this evening in the Old
Union. Actions of the Board must be agreed on hy the Council.
At the session of the Council held on March 10 after the Daily had
surrendered to finals a majority of the house presidents expressed their
disapproval of the Board's action earlier in the week. A committee was
appointed to work out a more tenable plan of penalizing the fraternities
for their illegal rushing. Many suggestions were offered for penalties

♦ such as money fines, but the general
opinion branded them all as im
j practical.
The committee, composed of Ike
! Livermore, Jack Hinchliffe, and
Wayne Ketron, whs instructed to
work out a logical substitute for the
ruling of the Interfraternity Board
in order to show (heir desire for
co-operation. It is the desire of the
Council to present a definite plan
which will persuade the Board to
rescind its action.
At tonight's meeting the Council
can either refuse to abide by the
ruling of the Board, which is the
probable action, thereby blocking
I the existing penalties, or consent to
abide by the rulings of the latter
body. In the event that the Council
refuses to accept the Board's judg
ment, it will present a new solution
of the illegal rushing problem drawn
up by its committee to be acted on
by the Board Wednesday night.
Three new members of the Inter
fraternity Board of Control were
made at the March 10 meeting of
the Council; two were to replace
expired appointments and one to
complete an unfinished term. Tom
Campbell and Ike Livermore will
hold office from the beginning of
this quarter until spring quarter of
1933, replacing Frank Booth and
Wallace Butler. Wayne Ketron was
appointed to fill the unexpired term
of Ward Wood, who has taken a
leave of absence. His term runs un
til the opening of next fall quarter.
