# Tayler Talks On Music As Basic Medium
## Emphasis On Importance In Modern Education 
### 
Edward Douglas Tayler, promi
nent British musician, writer, and
lecturer, spoke last night in the
Little Theatre on "Music in Life
and Education." Mr. Tayler illus
trated his lecture by folk songs, sea
chanties, love songs, martial music,
and working melodies. He was as
sisted by his wife, Dora Tayler, and
his son, David.
Music is primarily the basis for
man's expression of his repressed
emotional nature, combined with his
intellectual development, Tayler
said. Growing out of the life of the
people to fill their needs, music ex
presses man's complete life, includ
ing his work, play, learning, and
emotions. On this basis, Tayler
showed how the folk songs, love
songs, and occasional melodies grow
according to man's needs and de
velopment.
Man Is Complex
Much of Tayler's work has been 1
in the field of musical education.
Man is complex, he said, and the J
whole man must be trained to use j
his natural tendencies in the most J
artistic and vitalizing ways. The
speaker traced the natural associa- 1
tion of music with the child's I
growth, and showed how it reached
the highest point, in artistic creation.
He cited music as the driving power
in life.
