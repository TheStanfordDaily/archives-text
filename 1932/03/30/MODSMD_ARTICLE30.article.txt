# TABLE SUGAR MAY COME INTO USE AS BUILDING MATERIAL
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, March 29. (/P.l—
Table sugar became a building ma
terial for skyscrapers today.
Little mortar bricks, with their
strength increased 60 per cent sim
ply by sweetening them like coffee,
were .shown to the American Chem
ical Society. This industrial use for
sugar was announced by the Mellon
Institute of Industrial Research in a
paper by Dr. Gerald J. Cox and Dr.
John Metschl, who obtained their
tip from ancient Rome.
Encyclopedias stated that the
Romans sugared their mortar. Many
present-day lime experts said they
had heard sugar was good. But .so
far ys the Mellon Institute scientists
could ascertain, no one knew pre
cisely how or why. The "discovery"
consists in developing a process
giving exact results, which they
state is cheap enough to offer a new
industrial use for the saccharine.
