MERCED. March 29 (>P).â€”Details
of the suicide of a disappointed swain
by dynamite and his attempt to kill
the girl and seven relatives were
revealed today at a Coroner's in
quest into the death of John Gam
bino, 30. Merced truck driver.
After Gambino was buried today

jured pride by igniting a stick of
dynamite in his mouth in the same
house with Mrs. Mary B. Harris, 23,
and seven of her relatives.
The blast shook Merced about
9:30 p.m. and tore out an entire
section of the house, including two
rooms, a porch and a roof. Gamino
was blown to bits. Mrs. Harris,
whom he had courted and lost, was
struck by a piece of Hying wood, but
only slightly injured.

ment's field telephone equipment
may also be used to carry current
