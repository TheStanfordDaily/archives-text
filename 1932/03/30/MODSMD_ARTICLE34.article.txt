# WEAK-KNEED ACTION, COUNCIL
## 
### 
A member of the faculty and the Men's Council, bv their
action at the end of last quarter, did more to undermine the
Honor Code than anything that lias happened during the
school year.
The case was two men convicted of removing turned-in
home-work problems from the professor's desk and copy
ing these in the back of the room during class hours.
Realizing that the success of the Honor Code lay in
strict and stringent enforcement of the rules, the Men's
Council at the first of the year resolved to punish all con
victions with a three-quarter suspension as a minimum
sentence. For almost two quarters the Council held to its
ruling and punished all violaters with the suspension pen
alty. Then it lost its backbone and, forgetting its respon
sibility to the student body, weakly sentenced the two con
victed students to work off hours at the Convalescent Home
instead of suspending them.
The reason given for lessening the penalty was that
cheating was quite prevalent in the department concerned,
the Council feebly stating that this was a warning measure
and does not represent a deviation from the three-quarters
penalty.
The school expects the Council to enforce the Honor
Code and, if students are convicted of cheating, they are
to be punished and not "warned." How does the Council
expect to stop the prevalent cheating in this department if
not by harsh measures. The next student convicted will
probably receive a light tap on the wrist.
The other sad part of tins case is the professor's ad
mitting knowledge of cheating in his classes but taking no
steps to stop it. Enforcement of the Honor Code has been
turned over to the students and members of the faculty
should turn all cases over to the Men's Council for action.
It is bad enough when the professors try to stop cheating
themselves but it is little short of disgraceful for a faculty
man to allow cheating to flourish unconstrained in his
classes.
One of the strongest arguments against the Honor Code
as it now stands is that a group of students like the Men's
Council would not be stringent enough in penalizing other
students. It looks as though the objection is a valid one
unless the Council stops degenerating to personalities and
assumes its responsibilities. The Council has claimed that
ii is capable of handling violations. Its action in this case
has again laid its claim open to question.

Code and, if students are convicted of cheating, they are
to be punished and not "warned." How does the Council
expect to stop the prevalent cheating in this department if
not by harsh measures. The next student convicted will
probably receive a light tap on the wrist.
The other sad part of tins case is the professor's ad
mitting knowledge of cheating in his classes but taking no
steps to stop it. Enforcement of the Honor Code has been
turned over to the students and members of the faculty
should turn all cases over to the Men's Council for action.
It is bad enough when the professors try to stop cheating
themselves but it is little short of disgraceful for a faculty
man to allow cheating to flourish unconstrained in his
classes.
One of the strongest arguments against the Honor Code
as it now stands is that a group of students like the Men's
Council would not be stringent enough in penalizing other
students. It looks as though the objection is a valid one
unless the Council stops degenerating to personalities and
assumes its responsibilities. The Council has claimed that
ii is capable of handling violations. Its action in this case
has again laid its claim open to question.
A member of the faculty and the Men's Council, bv their
action at the end of last quarter, did more to undermine the
Honor Code than anything that lias happened during the
school year.
The case was two men convicted of removing turned-in
home-work problems from the professor's desk and copy
ing these in the back of the room during class hours.
Realizing that the success of the Honor Code lay in
strict and stringent enforcement of the rules, the Men's
Council at the first of the year resolved to punish all con
victions with a three-quarter suspension as a minimum
sentence. For almost two quarters the Council held to its
ruling and punished all violaters with the suspension pen
alty. Then it lost its backbone and, forgetting its respon
sibility to the student body, weakly sentenced the two con
victed students to work off hours at the Convalescent Home
instead of suspending them.
The reason given for lessening the penalty was that
cheating was quite prevalent in the department concerned,
the Council feebly stating that this was a warning measure
and does not represent a deviation from the three-quarters
penalty.
The school expects the Council to enforce the Honor
Code and, if students are convicted of cheating, they are
to be punished and not "warned." How does the Council
expect to stop the prevalent cheating in this department if
not by harsh measures. The next student convicted will
probably receive a light tap on the wrist.
