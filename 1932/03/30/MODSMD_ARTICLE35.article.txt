# CHECK YOUR HAT, MISTER?

A rough out for a cheap evening doesn't expect much.
II he wanders into a four-hit dance palace with a gal who
is just another date, he seldom even looks for a check
room, since finding one would only entail additional ex
pense.
However, for something like the Junior Prom, for ex
ample, where a man lays a high tariff on the line, borrows
ii car and ;i tux and spends half a day arranging the little
things for a hig evening with THE little girl, he hates to

customers' coats. Incidentally, the gentleman in question
paid twenty cents for the privilege.
Arranging an efficient checking system should entail
little of either effort or expense. Besides promoting
smoother evenings for campus daters, it might prove profit
able for those who lease the gym. After all, campus dances
have been held elsewhere, in locations that provide ade
quate checking facilities.
