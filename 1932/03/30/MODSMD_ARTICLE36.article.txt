# BULL SESSION
## "SPRING RUSHING"—A TRADITION 
### 
The only thing that could vie in
interest the last week of winter
quarter with "Finals" was that
cataclysmic bombshell—the rushing
ban. Unexpected in its appearance
and unprecedented in its severity—
it proved that the dead shall live
again—that the Interfraternity Board
had suffered a rebirth —and that it
is possible to punish even when
everybody has been found guilty.
Whether the Board was merely
suddenly bitten by an evangelical
bug and in a fury of righteousness
turned on its perennial tormentors
with an unknown ferocity or
whether the Board acted with a full
knowledge of consequences remains
to be seen. Whether the Board will
enforce its decision during the long
months that are to come is a matter
of doubt. Everybody can guess and
our guess is that it will not carry
out that noble gesture of March Bth.
First of all, there is nothing in
the penalty to stop illegal rushing.
Rushing will continue during this
quarter and during the summer—
with special emphasis on the latter.
Why not? No house has suffered
particularly. All have suffered gen
erally. The net disadvantage to each
house is almost a perfect zero.
Starting all the runners ten yards
behind the mark is no deterrent to
jumping the gun. Slap a ten-yard
handicap on one-third of the con
testants and there is a marked in
centive toward leaving the line at

] the proper time.
To merely penalize one or two
j houses is not suflicient. The gain
| from illegal rushing outweighs the
I disadvantage of being caught once
j in a long time. To force people to
|do right, the penalty must clearly
| outweigh all possible gains. The
| bold thing—the effective action for
the Board was to have penalized
about eight of the worst offenders,
j The grim possibility of becoming
, like one of the eight might have
forced the rest of the houses to hie
j to the straight and narrow. As it is,
| illegal rushing will continue on its
| merry way—longer, more expensive,
| and possibly more secretive.
; And meanwhile, all sorts of plans
; have been hashed by the ban. First
| of all, where will the freshmen live
| for the first month of next autumn
| quarter? Hall rents are payable
j quarterly—that obviates them. The
j Big Parade to Palo Alto is the only
| answer. The trek to this haven is
| no path of lilies and the end of the
trail is no bed of roses.
The unused wings of the Presi
! dent's Mansion or tents along the
i shores of Lagunita are only remote
j possibilities. Second, Encina Com
j inons will not have the customary
' respite during spring when meals
I are served on the Row; the Class
!of '35 can kiss their rebates fare
! well. And where are the men and
! the money for rushing illegal and
j legal? Ask some of the houses.

The only thing that could vie in
interest the last week of winter
quarter with "Finals" was that
cataclysmic bombshell—the rushing
ban. Unexpected in its appearance
and unprecedented in its severity—
it proved that the dead shall live
again—that the Interfraternity Board
had suffered a rebirth —and that it
is possible to punish even when
everybody has been found guilty.
Whether the Board was merely
suddenly bitten by an evangelical
bug and in a fury of righteousness
turned on its perennial tormentors
with an unknown ferocity or
whether the Board acted with a full
knowledge of consequences remains
to be seen. Whether the Board will
enforce its decision during the long
months that are to come is a matter
of doubt. Everybody can guess and
our guess is that it will not carry
out that noble gesture of March Bth.
First of all, there is nothing in
the penalty to stop illegal rushing.
Rushing will continue during this
quarter and during the summer—
with special emphasis on the latter.
Why not? No house has suffered
particularly. All have suffered gen
erally. The net disadvantage to each
house is almost a perfect zero.
Starting all the runners ten yards
behind the mark is no deterrent to
jumping the gun. Slap a ten-yard
handicap on one-third of the con
testants and there is a marked in
centive toward leaving the line at

] the proper time.
To merely penalize one or two
j houses is not suflicient. The gain
| from illegal rushing outweighs the
I disadvantage of being caught once
j in a long time. To force people to
|do right, the penalty must clearly
| outweigh all possible gains. The
| bold thing—the effective action for
the Board was to have penalized
about eight of the worst offenders,
j The grim possibility of becoming
, like one of the eight might have
forced the rest of the houses to hie
j to the straight and narrow. As it is,
| illegal rushing will continue on its
| merry way—longer, more expensive,
| and possibly more secretive.
; And meanwhile, all sorts of plans
; have been hashed by the ban. First
| of all, where will the freshmen live
| for the first month of next autumn
| quarter? Hall rents are payable
j quarterly—that obviates them. The
j Big Parade to Palo Alto is the only
| answer. The trek to this haven is
| no path of lilies and the end of the
trail is no bed of roses.
The unused wings of the Presi
! dent's Mansion or tents along the
i shores of Lagunita are only remote
j possibilities. Second, Encina Com
j inons will not have the customary
' respite during spring when meals
I are served on the Row; the Class
!of '35 can kiss their rebates fare
! well. And where are the men and
! the money for rushing illegal and
