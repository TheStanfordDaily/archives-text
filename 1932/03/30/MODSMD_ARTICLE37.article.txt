BRAVE NEW WORLD—By Aldous j
Huxley. Doubleday Doran. 11)32. :
i The author of "Point Counter'
! Point," "Antic Hay," "Brief Can- j
I dies,"' and "Music at Night" achieves j
j a new satirical growth in this glori- |
j ous jibe at mass production and |
| "Model T Civilization."
i Mr. Huxley's is truly a trenchant I
i wit. In these short pages a "Brave j
New World" is constructed. Here
only the primary, basic feelings re- .
main, although the reader runs the J
whole gamut of emotions. A caste j
system standardized by pre-natal
influence, the "hatching" of children ;
| (in this Utopia, "mother" and j
"born" are obscene words), are fea- j
I tures of this large-scale Dearborn, j
j Physical content incurred before !
1 birth, and mental content produced i
jby the universal use of a drug: j
j "soma" insures social stability. Un- !
I restricted pleasure (because the in- [
; dividual is predestined to be pleased !
' with only those things which are j
good for him and the race), and no !
I knowledge of pain, sorrow, love, or i
j a possibility of a changed order j
' exists. Of course a consummation of ,
I the baser idea of love is a material !
part of the civilization.
The reader sees this whirl
through the eyes of several types—
J misfits .... those who rise above j
i their predestined consciousness of a !
; stability in the existing order. A .
j "savage" who by accident was
i "born" is brought to the Brave New '
I World, from the New Mexico Reser- I
j vation, a museum of Twentieth- '
| Century way, but, of course, his
l feeling is incommunicable.
It appeals to the reviewer as one j
of the most delicious satires of re- j
! cent years. In places it is scream- ;
I ingly funny—other parts show tre- !
i mendous power. The cut of Mr. {
Huxley's satire is deep, but his j
sympathy is even more profound.

THE SILENT WITNESS —At the |
Varsity Theatre.
This picture is Lionel Atwill and j
j rightly so. This does not mean that i
, the other characters, the plot, and !
I the photography are not good; they
are, extraordinarily. But for a fine
piece of concentrated, intense act
' ing, this actor of the legitimate stage
i has done the best job we have seen |
on the screen for some considerable !
i time. As the father who finds that j
j a crime has been put upon his own
! shoulders when lie is trying to pro- I
tect his son he carries off enor- ,
mously difficult situations with |
finesse and excellence.
Greta Nissen as the murdered i
charmer is fine when she is proper- J
| ly dressed but revolting as a partly j
; dressed dead body. The humor in- |
| terest is injected through the me- ;
; dium of two of the funniest little '
Cockneys ever seen on the screen. I
| The story is well conceived and J
I finely executed with a finale which I
|is really unusual and surprising.
The plot is never allowed to drag !
where it obviously might.
Altogether one of the finest per
formances that Hollywood has ever i
produced in the matter of murder j
mysteries.
Shorts —considerably worse than j
usual even. Rudy Vallee simpers i
along with a bouncing ball and many
pseudo collegians in an affair which
we seem to have seen in a Palo !
Alto theatre before ;ind not so long !

CYRANO DE BERGERAC— At the
Columbia, San Francisco.
The second Cyrano de Bergerac
which San Francisco audiences!
I have had an opportunity to see this I
i season, comes in the person of Wal- i
j ter Hampden, who is a very re
■ markable Cyrano, indeed. In fact,

he is acclaimed the master in por
traying Rostand's famous character.
The performance is very complete
and lengthy, beginning with an 8
o'clock curtain and lasting well on
to 11:30. Other presentations of the
play have omitted parts of the nose
speech, the balcony scene, and the
long speeches in the Bakery of the
Poets. All of these are given in full
and with many flourishes in the
present production. The cast is
enormous, well-costumed, and well
chfsen, including two prancing
ponies to draw Roxane's carriage.
Hampden's eloquent reproduction
of Rostand's poetic cadences is well
suited to Cyrano, and the lines pro
vide much food for thought.
However, if you would be inter
ested in a lip from your reviewer,
he'd suggest that you secrete a ham
sandwich in your coat pocket. The
bakery scenes, and the feasting of
the cadets are fatal to a sympa
thetic stomach. —E.E.H.

THE SILENT WITNESS —At the |

This picture is Lionel Atwill and j
j rightly so. This does not mean that i
, the other characters, the plot, and !
I the photography are not good; they
are, extraordinarily. But for a fine
piece of concentrated, intense act
' ing, this actor of the legitimate stage
i has done the best job we have seen |
on the screen for some considerable !
i time. As the father who finds that j
j a crime has been put upon his own
! shoulders when lie is trying to pro- I
tect his son he carries off enor- ,
mously difficult situations with |
finesse and excellence.
Greta Nissen as the murdered i
charmer is fine when she is proper- J
| ly dressed but revolting as a partly j
; dressed dead body. The humor in- |
| terest is injected through the me- ;
; dium of two of the funniest little '
Cockneys ever seen on the screen. I
| The story is well conceived and J
I finely executed with a finale which I
|is really unusual and surprising.
The plot is never allowed to drag !
where it obviously might.
Altogether one of the finest per
formances that Hollywood has ever i
produced in the matter of murder j
mysteries.

CYRANO DE BERGERAC— At the
Columbia, San Francisco.
The second Cyrano de Bergerac
which San Francisco audiences!
I have had an opportunity to see this I
i season, comes in the person of Wal- i
j ter Hampden, who is a very re
■ markable Cyrano, indeed. In fact,

he is acclaimed the master in por
traying Rostand's famous character.
The performance is very complete
and lengthy, beginning with an 8
o'clock curtain and lasting well on
to 11:30. Other presentations of the
play have omitted parts of the nose
speech, the balcony scene, and the
long speeches in the Bakery of the
Poets. All of these are given in full
and with many flourishes in the
present production. The cast is
enormous, well-costumed, and well
chfsen, including two prancing
ponies to draw Roxane's carriage.
Hampden's eloquent reproduction
of Rostand's poetic cadences is well
suited to Cyrano, and the lines pro
vide much food for thought.
However, if you would be inter
ested in a lip from your reviewer,
he'd suggest that you secrete a ham
sandwich in your coat pocket. The
bakery scenes, and the feasting of
the cadets are fatal to a sympa
thetic stomach. —E.E.H.

THE SILENT WITNESS —At the |
Varsity Theatre.
This picture is Lionel Atwill and j
j rightly so. This does not mean that i
, the other characters, the plot, and !
I the photography are not good; they
are, extraordinarily. But for a fine
piece of concentrated, intense act
' ing, this actor of the legitimate stage
i has done the best job we have seen |
on the screen for some considerable !
i time. As the father who finds that j
j a crime has been put upon his own
! shoulders when lie is trying to pro- I
tect his son he carries off enor- ,
mously difficult situations with |
finesse and excellence.
Greta Nissen as the murdered i
charmer is fine when she is proper- J
| ly dressed but revolting as a partly j
; dressed dead body. The humor in- |
| terest is injected through the me- ;
; dium of two of the funniest little '
Cockneys ever seen on the screen. I
| The story is well conceived and J
I finely executed with a finale which I
|is really unusual and surprising.
The plot is never allowed to drag !
where it obviously might.
Altogether one of the finest per
formances that Hollywood has ever i
produced in the matter of murder j
mysteries.
Shorts —considerably worse than j
usual even. Rudy Vallee simpers i
along with a bouncing ball and many
pseudo collegians in an affair which
we seem to have seen in a Palo !
Alto theatre before ;ind not so long !

CYRANO DE BERGERAC— At the
Columbia, San Francisco.
The second Cyrano de Bergerac
which San Francisco audiences!
I have had an opportunity to see this I
i season, comes in the person of Wal- i
j ter Hampden, who is a very re
■ markable Cyrano, indeed. In fact,

he is acclaimed the master in por
traying Rostand's famous character.
The performance is very complete
and lengthy, beginning with an 8
o'clock curtain and lasting well on
to 11:30. Other presentations of the
play have omitted parts of the nose
speech, the balcony scene, and the
long speeches in the Bakery of the
Poets. All of these are given in full
and with many flourishes in the
present production. The cast is
enormous, well-costumed, and well
chfsen, including two prancing
ponies to draw Roxane's carriage.
Hampden's eloquent reproduction
of Rostand's poetic cadences is well
suited to Cyrano, and the lines pro
vide much food for thought.
However, if you would be inter
ested in a lip from your reviewer,
he'd suggest that you secrete a ham
sandwich in your coat pocket. The
bakery scenes, and the feasting of
the cadets are fatal to a sympa
thetic stomach. —E.E.H.
BRAVE NEW WORLD—By Aldous j
Huxley. Doubleday Doran. 11)32. :
i The author of "Point Counter'
! Point," "Antic Hay," "Brief Can- j
I dies,"' and "Music at Night" achieves j
j a new satirical growth in this glori- |
j ous jibe at mass production and |
| "Model T Civilization."
i Mr. Huxley's is truly a trenchant I
i wit. In these short pages a "Brave j
New World" is constructed. Here
only the primary, basic feelings re- .
main, although the reader runs the J
whole gamut of emotions. A caste j
system standardized by pre-natal
influence, the "hatching" of children ;
| (in this Utopia, "mother" and j
"born" are obscene words), are fea- j
I tures of this large-scale Dearborn, j
j Physical content incurred before !
1 birth, and mental content produced i
jby the universal use of a drug: j
j "soma" insures social stability. Un- !
I restricted pleasure (because the in- [
; dividual is predestined to be pleased !
' with only those things which are j
good for him and the race), and no !
I knowledge of pain, sorrow, love, or i
j a possibility of a changed order j
' exists. Of course a consummation of ,
I the baser idea of love is a material !
part of the civilization.
The reader sees this whirl
through the eyes of several types—
J misfits .... those who rise above j
i their predestined consciousness of a !
; stability in the existing order. A .
j "savage" who by accident was
i "born" is brought to the Brave New '
I World, from the New Mexico Reser- I
j vation, a museum of Twentieth- '
| Century way, but, of course, his
l feeling is incommunicable.
