TWO CHAMPIONS met near j
Menlo Park yesterday afternoon.
Being called the "Phar Lap of the |
college boys" by a well-known San I
Francisco sports writer was too
much for Ben Eastman, and he had |
to see what it was all about.
When the lamous red gelding, who I
won so many races in Australia,
they had to bring him to America j
to seek new fields to conquer, was I
brought out at the Perry track at j
Menlo yesterday, there was no more i
interested spectator present than j
Eastman.
"How about a match race be
tween you and Phar Lap?" j
somebody asked Ben.
The famous Eastman grin
flashed as he replied. "1 guess
that wouldn't be much of a j
race."
11 was recalled that some pub- ;
licity-seeking individual partici
pated in several 50-yard dashes :
against a horse at Del Monte last j
year, breaking about even. A gun
was used in starting the races, J
however, which so startled the i
horse that it gave the man start '
enough to enable him to reach the '
tape first by a nostril.
• • •
PHAR LAP wasn't given an op- I
port unity yesterday to display that !
tremendously long stride they say J
he has. A trainer led him around j
the half-mile track several times, |
and that was the extent of the j
workout.
There will be another oppor
tunity to see him at 3 o'clock |
this afternoon, but nary a can- j
ter will he canter. If negotia
tions are completed for his pro
posed appearance at Tanforan,
Pilar Lap will be removed to
the San Bruno track to com- I
plete his training.
The leg injury the big fellow sus- >
tained in winning the Agua Caliente ;
Handicap has not completely healed |
but is not regarded as serious.
. ~ .
THEY SEEM worried over at
California about their man Kiesel.
They seem to be afraid that the
rest of the track world won't take
him seriously, and every effort is
being made to '"build up" his ap
proach : ng sprint duels with Frank
Wykoff in Saturday's Southern
California meet, and with Abe I
Hables in next month's Big Meet.
Even Californians hold little hope!
of a victory in the century dash i
against Wykoft, but they do hope i
for a win in the furlong.
As for Ilables, many eager
(•olden Bear followers are look- i
ing for him to steam in behind
the one ace of the Christie
squad in both sprint events.
Well, Abe is willing to take
Kiesel seriously—lie says lie is
a real sprinter—but not THAT
seriously.
In other words, Hables doesn't
expect either sprint on the after
noon of April 16 to be exactly a
"lunch, BUT he does expect to do
n little tape-busting. All of which
is a pretty fair mental attitude for
Abe to have. —L.M.C.

PHAR LAP wasn't given an op- I
port unity yesterday to display that !
tremendously long stride they say J
he has. A trainer led him around j
the half-mile track several times, |
and that was the extent of the j
workout.
There will be another oppor
tunity to see him at 3 o'clock |
this afternoon, but nary a can- j
ter will he canter. If negotia
tions are completed for his pro
posed appearance at Tanforan,
Pilar Lap will be removed to
the San Bruno track to com- I
plete his training.
The leg injury the big fellow sus- >
tained in winning the Agua Caliente ;
Handicap has not completely healed |
but is not regarded as serious.

THEY SEEM worried over at
California about their man Kiesel.
They seem to be afraid that the
rest of the track world won't take
him seriously, and every effort is
being made to '"build up" his ap
proach : ng sprint duels with Frank
Wykoff in Saturday's Southern
California meet, and with Abe I
Hables in next month's Big Meet.
Even Californians hold little hope!
of a victory in the century dash i
against Wykoft, but they do hope i
for a win in the furlong.
As for Ilables, many eager
(•olden Bear followers are look- i
ing for him to steam in behind
the one ace of the Christie
squad in both sprint events.
Well, Abe is willing to take
Kiesel seriously—lie says lie is
a real sprinter—but not THAT
seriously.
In other words, Hables doesn't
expect either sprint on the after
noon of April 16 to be exactly a
"lunch, BUT he does expect to do
n little tape-busting. All of which
is a pretty fair mental attitude for
Abe to have. —L.M.C.
TWO CHAMPIONS met near j
Menlo Park yesterday afternoon.
Being called the "Phar Lap of the |
college boys" by a well-known San I
Francisco sports writer was too
much for Ben Eastman, and he had |
to see what it was all about.
When the lamous red gelding, who I
won so many races in Australia,
they had to bring him to America j
to seek new fields to conquer, was I
brought out at the Perry track at j
Menlo yesterday, there was no more i
interested spectator present than j
Eastman.
"How about a match race be
tween you and Phar Lap?" j
somebody asked Ben.
The famous Eastman grin
flashed as he replied. "1 guess
that wouldn't be much of a j
race."
11 was recalled that some pub- ;
licity-seeking individual partici
pated in several 50-yard dashes :
against a horse at Del Monte last j
year, breaking about even. A gun
was used in starting the races, J
however, which so startled the i
horse that it gave the man start '
enough to enable him to reach the '
tape first by a nostril.
