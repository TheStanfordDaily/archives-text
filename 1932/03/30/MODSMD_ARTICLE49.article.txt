Stanford's 1932 football season is
' scheduled to get under way today
! at 4 o'clock when Coach Pop War-
I ner calls together his varsity pigskin
I hopefuls for the opening of the an
! nual spring practice session.
Equipment was issued to 98 men
i yesterday, and this number will be
; increased when baseball and track
1 seasons end. Ernie Caddell, Gordy
i Campbell, and Stan Anderson,
i members of last year's varsity, are
1 still competing in the diamond
j sport, while Dink Templeton's track
| team requires the services of Here
; Laborde, George Grey, and Nellie
j Gray. The frosh track and baseball
j teams will release some promising
: grid prospects when their seasons
J come to a close.
19 Lettermen Back
Coach Warner will have 19 letter
men ready for action next fall, 14
j of whom will report this afternoon.
| His problem, however, will be to
j fill the shoes of those regulars from
I last year lost because of gradua
' tion. His task is particularly difli-
J cult in the guard and tackle posi
j tions, where three of four regulars
! were graduated.
Bill Corbus will be on hand to
\ resume his duties at right guard,
: but who will resume the work car
ried out by Pay Dawson, Pete Hei
! ser, Ray Hulen, and Windy Bigolow
| at the other guard post last year is
( still unknown.
Ehrhorn, Hand Gone
Chuck Ehrhorn and Red Hand
j played tackle last season and their
; positions will also be hard to fill.
; Red Gribben, a letterman from the
! 1931 eleven, is the only experienced
| mair at this position who is return
j ing
j In addition to the members of last
year's squad, Coach Warner will
j have a great deal of promising ma
j terial from the Goofs and the 1931
1 freshman eleven. It is also expected
i that several junior college transfers
j will step to the fore as members of
I the Cardinal varsity.
