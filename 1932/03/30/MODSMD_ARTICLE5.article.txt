## California Solon Scores Gambling Palaces 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 29. (j£R)—
Conditions which Representative
Free, Republican, California, de
scribed as "hell on earth" were at
tributed today before a House com
mittee to "floating gambling palaces"
anchored outside the three-mile
limit.
His statement was made before
the House Merchant Marine Com
mittee, considering a bill to prevent
"free taxi service" from the shore
to these gambling palaces.
"People go out to the boats and
lose their money," Free said. "When
they get back ashore, they rob fill
ing stations or anything, or commit
suicide because of their de
spondency. It's hell on earth in that
locality,"
He testified there are two such
boats anchored off San Pedro, and
one, which had been off Florida, is
on its way to the New Jersey coast
off Atlantic City.
