# STANFORD FRESHMAN DISTANCE STARS HEADED BY MORENTIN, DEVLIN, BROWN
## 
### 
Track and field experts agree that
much of the success enjoyed by
U.S.C. track teams may be directly
credited to the Trojans' policy of
developing California state cham
pions of the previous year.
Phi! Morentin is the first C.I.F.
champion to compete for Stanford
in some time, although Bill Miller
won the pole vault crown while at
San Diego High. Phil won the mile
for Visalia High in both 1930 and
2931. In 1930 Morentin ran his op
ponents dizzy to win in 4:31, but in
his senior year was slowed up by
lack of competition, his time being
4:32.8.
In his first two meets this year,
Morentin won in 4:4f> and 4:43.3, but
was not extended in either racc.
Since litile good competition may
be expected from the Alameda All -
Star rnilers this Saturday, Stanford
track fans will have to wait until
Ihe Little Big Meet to find out just

I how good Morentin really is.
Dave Devlin is the Oklahoma
state mile champion, his time being
4:36. Devlin also ran a half-mile in
j 2:02 in high school, and has run
; this event in excellent freshman
time, but seems destined to become
: more famous at the longer races.
Devlin's ambition is to run two
miles in ten minutes, and his only
( tries at the eight-lap grind have
i been so good, that many people be
-1 lieve he will break the Little Big
Meet record.
The third member of the yearling
triumvirate is Bob Brown, who
holds the Northern California pri
vate-school conference record of
4:51. Brown is running the mile at
about that speed now, and in ad
dition has developed into one of the
: best freshman quarter - milers.
Morentin has an exceptionally
J and powerful stride, while Devlin's
[ running is notable for its smooth,

! tireless appearance.
Morentin and Deviin will run both
the mile and two-mile events in the
! Little Big Meet, while Brown will
! run either the mile and the relay,
! or the 440 and relay. On the per

formances of these three former
high-school stars may hinge Stan
ford's chances of hanging up an
other of their annual Little Big
Meet victories over the Golden
Bear.

formances of these three former
high-school stars may hinge Stan
ford's chances of hanging up an
other of their annual Little Big
Meet victories over the Golden
Bear.
Track and field experts agree that
much of the success enjoyed by
U.S.C. track teams may be directly
credited to the Trojans' policy of
developing California state cham
pions of the previous year.
Phi! Morentin is the first C.I.F.
champion to compete for Stanford
in some time, although Bill Miller
won the pole vault crown while at
San Diego High. Phil won the mile
for Visalia High in both 1930 and
2931. In 1930 Morentin ran his op
ponents dizzy to win in 4:31, but in
his senior year was slowed up by
lack of competition, his time being
4:32.8.
In his first two meets this year,
Morentin won in 4:4f> and 4:43.3, but
was not extended in either racc.
Since litile good competition may
be expected from the Alameda All -
Star rnilers this Saturday, Stanford
track fans will have to wait until
Ihe Little Big Meet to find out just

I how good Morentin really is.
Dave Devlin is the Oklahoma
state mile champion, his time being
4:36. Devlin also ran a half-mile in

; this event in excellent freshman
time, but seems destined to become
: more famous at the longer races.

miles in ten minutes, and his only
( tries at the eight-lap grind have
i been so good, that many people be
-1 lieve he will break the Little Big
Meet record.

triumvirate is Bob Brown, who
holds the Northern California pri
vate-school conference record of

about that speed now, and in ad
dition has developed into one of the
: best freshman quarter - milers.

J and powerful stride, while Devlin's
[ running is notable for its smooth,

! tireless appearance.
Morentin and Deviin will run both
the mile and two-mile events in the
