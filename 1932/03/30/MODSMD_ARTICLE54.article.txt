# TROJAN OUTFIT INVADES FARM FOR BALL TILT
## Indians Have Mathematical Chance For Title; To Face U.C. Saturday 
### 
With five games won and five
more in the red, Stanford's varsity
baseball team takes on the S.C. Tro
jans and the California Bears on
Friday and Saturday in two games
that will go a long way toward de
ciding what chance if any remains
for another Indian championship.
The Trojans will be playing the
last of five successive games when
they invade the Farm, and the In
dians will have an excellent chance
to take the odd contest of the an
nual three-game series.
Santa Clara went down before the
invaders Monday, 13-10, with their
ace pitcher hurling erratic ball. The
Drones suffered from the same mal
ady that be.,et the Indians on their
Southern invasion—inability to hang
onto the ball.
California, after a wobbly start at
the first of the .season, has piled up
seven victories against two defeats.
However, they take on Santa Clara,
U.S.C., and Stanford in four days
this week, and are due for a drop in
the standings unless they play phe
nomenal ball.
Coach Wolter has yet to decide on
his starting chuckers for both games,
although Anderson will probably
get the call against el Trojan, de
pending on ihe showing the South
erners make in the other four
games.
There is little that the Farm
horsehiders can do to stop their
i losing ways unless the infield ac
quires some life and learns to hang
onto the ball.
