Following the completion of the
intramural basketball league at the
close of last quarter, an all-star live
was selected by the mural officials
an:l members of the Stanford Daily
staff. To pick the live outstanding
basketball players from a group of
about 250 men who competed was
a difficult task, but it is doubtful If
a better selection could have been
made than the one printed above.
Bob Fisher and Verne Brown were
largely responsible for El Toro's
successful campaign. Fisher was
high-point man in every game in
which he competed, while Brown's
work at guard always kepi the op
ponents from scoring with too much
regularity. Ruhland Isaly was se
lected for the other guard post
chiefly because of his fast floorwork
on the Menlo Hasher five.
George Griffin was one of the
main cogs in the Theta Chi offense.
Other men who deserve mention
for their good work are: Johnson,
Sigma Chi: McDowell, Business
School; Beatty, Bost, Encina ZE;
Folsom, D.U.'s; Mcßride, Chi Psi's;
Lindsley and Coonradt, Phi Kappa
Sigma; Valentine, Los Arcos;
Strong, Sequoia II; Reid, McGarr,
Merilo Hashers; Morse, El Toro;
Nakamura, Japanese Club; and
Metzger, Theta Chi.
In the finals of the league, played
the last week of last quarter, El
Toro easily swamped the Menlo
Hashers 40-13 to climax a season
of eight straight victories. They de
feated Phi Kappa Sigma 21-12 in
the semi-finals, while the Hashers
were taking Delta Upsilon, 28-14.
