# HEDBERG ADVANCES NOVEL THEORY ON DAM CONSTRUCTION
## Flexible Series Of Arches, Lubricated, Replaces Old Rigid Types 
### 
A flexible dam constructed of
.several arches separated by layers
of some lubricant, instead of the
ordinary solid, rigid type, is the in
teresting proposal of John Hedberg,
instructor in civil engineering.
If his experiments bear his theo
ries out, Hedberg believes, it may
be possible greatly to reduce the
cost of dams by reducing the
amount of material needed.
At present, Hedberg said yester
day, the stress on dams is unequally
distributed, the foundation bearing
the most and the abutments at the
side but little, since the foundation
must resist the outward push ex
erted on the top of the dam by the
water.
By making the dam flexible, he
thinks, the foundation would not
have this push to resist and the load
would be* more equally distributed
to the abutments. This would lessen
the maximum load and the arch
could be made thinner, effecting a
great saving in materials.
Hedberg would secure this flexi
bility by constructing the dam of
several layers, separated by grease
or graphite to reduce friction and
enable the arch to yield to the
stress.
One difficulty which presents
itself, he said, is that the stress
might be as unequally distributed as
before, with the abutments bearing
the brunt of the load. There is also
the possibility that flexibility might
increase the natural period of vibra
tions, increasing the danger from
earth tremors, Hedberg said. Every
large structure has this vibration,
he said.
The cost of building several
arches might also exceed the sav
ing effected in smaller amount of
material needed.
Hedberg, who will give a seminar
course to a limited number of stu
dents in the subject, has constructed
a model dam in the hydraulic lab
oratory and will measure the stress
with micrometer microscopes. He
will then test the combined strength
of the arches with a testing machine
in the materials laboratory, as
against the strength of the solid
arch.
