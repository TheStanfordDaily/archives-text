## 
### 
With stiff practices to ease up the
joints after the holidays, the Stan
ford freshman baseball squad is
rounding into shape for the on
slaught of the University of Cali
fornia frosh nine at Berkeley next
Saturday morning.
The first of the Little Big Game
series should find the frosh nearing
the peak of their best seasonal con
dition. The brand of ball that the
yearlings have been displaying has
improved steadily, and the team is
back at last on the diamond in full
array.
With Gordy Mallatratt on first,
Jim Woolley at second, A1 Semmel
roth on third, and Jim Kurtz just
off the keystone bag, the infield will
present to any team a speedy, dan
gerous combination. In that outlay
lies the bulk of the frosh batting
power.
The outfield, formerly the weak
est part in the babes' ball system,
is turning into a bolstered propo
sition. With at least five men to
choose from, Coach Murray Cudde
back can throw numerous combina
tions into the outfield zone. What
ever outlay he may devise, though,
the fielders will remain the weakest
in the batting line.
