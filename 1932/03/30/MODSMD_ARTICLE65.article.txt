# Y.W.C.A. CABINET MEETING
## 
### 
So that it may not conflict with
spring rushing, the first weekly
cabinet meeting of the Stanford
Y.W.C.A. for this quarter will be
held this afternoon from 4 to 5
o'clock instead of at 5:45 o'clock as
previously announced. A full atten
dance is urged in order that the
business for this quarter may get
under way immediately.
