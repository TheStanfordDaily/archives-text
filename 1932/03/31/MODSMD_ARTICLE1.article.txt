MP ill; MATERIAL from which Coach Pop Warner will mold his l!K>2 grid i
machine revealed itself on the practice field greensward yesterday j
afternoon in the form of some 85 hopeful huskies who dug their cleats i
into the grass and went through the usual routine of the opening spring i
practice session. Cries of wailing alumni to the contrary, Stanford's foot
hail prospects looked anything but hopeless yesterday as the backfield '
men made the tackling dummies sorry they ever found their way to this 1
campus, and the centers, guards, tackles, and ends made the springs
supporting the dummy charging liner-

creak with the punch of their of- }
fense.
85 Turn Out
There were 85 men sweating out j
there yesterday, each and every one
of whom hopes to be among those
whom Coach Warner calls upon for j
his starting line-up next fall—each >
one determined to make his own J
work stand out during the practice
sessions.
Warner spoke briefly to the men,
explaining to them the chief ob- 1
stacles which they must overcome. j
During the spring practice he plans
to experiment with many new plays,
and most of the Friday scrimmages
will be devoted solely to the trial
execution of these new formations. J
With 19 returning lettermen, this
1932 eleven is being counted upon '
to bring back to the Farm some of I
the football glory enjoyed several \
seasons ago, when Stanford teams
were mopping up all that the Pacific
Coast or any other parts of the
country had to offer.
Five Men Lost
Five of last year's regulars have
been graduated and leave gaps to j
be filled. In the backfield, Captain j
Harry Hillman and Phil Moffatt will j
certainly be missed. But to fill Hill- i
man's post, Red Targhetta and Phil j
Baker will be on hand, while a host !
of halfbacks, including Campbell, j
Lambert, Anderson, Caddell, and i
Afflerbaugh will be ready to assume j
the ball-carrying duties.
Rudy Rintala's place at fullback j
will be well taken care of by the j
two men who shared the berth with j
him last year. These men are Dusty ;
Allen and Jack Hillman.
The loss of Chuck Ehrhorn and j
Red Hand, tackles on the 1931 squad, i
leaves a big gap, but Coach Warner j
will have Chuck Prelsnik, Red |
Gribben, and George Grey, return- j
ing lettermen, and Phil Johnson and !
Nellie Gray, who showed promise !
as members of the squad.
Corbus Returns
The situation at guard is also dif- ;
ficult, although Bill Corbus, all- j
coast guard, will be back for the !
position at the right of center. Fred j
Scribner and Windy Bigelow are I
other lettermen who return, but j
much new material will have to be j
uncovered before the beginning of I
the season.
The end and center positions are j
well fortified, with last year's first- !
string men returning. At center, Bill |
Milligan and Bill Bates will be j
ready for action, while Jay Todd, j
Don Colvin, and Bill Doub are the ;
lettermen who should be able to j
take care of the wings.
Several of last year's lettermen J
have felt the faculty's scholastic
ax, but their names have not been
announced officially. It is under
stood that a few of them may be
reinstated.
