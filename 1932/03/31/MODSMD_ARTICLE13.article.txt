## Confab Collapse Predicted By Chinese Newspapers

1 SHANGHAI, March 30—Peace ne
| gotiations here approached a crisis
i tonight after a sharp skirmish be
j tween Japanese and Chinese forces
i at Chiwangmiao earlier in the day.
I Chinese and Japanese military
i leaders still were far apart on truce
! terms. Chinese newspaper!; pre
| dieted that the conference would
i collapse. A Chinese spokesman said
j the parleys might reach a critical
i stage tomorrow, when they are to be
i resumed without definite recom-
I mendations for either side to be dis
■ cussed.
i The Japanese said the Chinese
j were driven to the south side of
| Soochow creek in the skirmish at
| Chiawangmiao. The Chinese had
j built defenses along the north side.
I The Japanese objected on the
i ground that the Chinese were over
'■ stepping the limits of an ultimatum
j served on them last month.
! A military subcommittee of the
; peace conference which has been
| going on here since the fighting
| was ordered stopped by the leaders
i of both sides nearly three weeks ago
| failed to agree on an armistice pro
j tocol.
Tentative concessions were made
| by both sides and they were closer
i to an understanding on the scope of
I the proposed Japanese troop with
! drawal from the territory now oc
cupied. But they were believed to
be hopelessly deadlocked on the
| length of time to be taken for the
Japanese retirement.
