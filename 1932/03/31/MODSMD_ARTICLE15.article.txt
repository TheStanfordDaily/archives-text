## 
### JAMES BADCON 
Usually in America when a col
lege student runs amuck of the
' "cops," it is because he is guilty of
unlawful conduct, but to be ar
rested merely because one is a stu
i dent was the experience Carlos
I Odriozola, Stanford freshman, al-
I most underwent. Odriozola is rcgis
i tered from Cicnfuegos, Cuba, a
place where police and students just
naturally don't get along.
Stanford was chosen for his Alma
I Mater because, in his opinion, "it is
: the only famous democratic school '
! in America." Odriozola has a broth- i
I er attending Harvard, but lie says
his brother has acquired too much ,
snobbish culture of the East to suit
him.
"S-t-a-n-f-o-r-d"
Questioned as to what extent
Stanford is known in Europe, he re
plied that in England he was forced
[ to spell the name out when he men- '
\ tinned it. But to add insult to in
j jury, no response whatever was

I
j manifested when the famous name
;of Stanford was offered in Spain.
While in Spain, he attended the Al
hambra theatre which he described
; as being "quite a killing show, equal
to none in America."
I'adlork Schools
"The Latin people as a whole take
, education quite seriously, although ,
at the present time practically all I
of the elementary and high schools,
and even the University of Havana
are closed on account of political i
' complications," he said. His uncle, \
I who is a member of the Cuban J
j Senate and Government Party, had j
the pleasure of discovering a bomb
; in his bathroom, placed there by a I
dissenter.
Nabbed As Student
I Upon his departure for Stanford
Ihe was accosted by the police for j
pursuing a student career, he said, i
j and only timely intervention of in-;
1 fluential persons saved him from a j
possible career in the jug.
