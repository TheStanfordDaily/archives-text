# ONE CENT POST RATE INCREASE CARRIES ROUSE
## High School Exempted As New Tax Hits College Sports Events 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (/P).â€”
A 1 cent increase in first class post
: age was approved, 147 to 63, today j
| by the House.
The item, the biggest single reve
j nue-raiser in the ways and means :
! committee's substitute for the sales :
| tax, was calculated to produce $135,-
000,000 of revenue.
Its adoption over the opposition |
of a group led by Representative
Rankin of Mississippi, one of the op
-1 ponents of the sales tax, came in a
i steady march of the program of the ;
I committee through the House.
Taxes on telegraph, telephone and |
| radio messages estimated to yield!
$33,000,000, were approved.
Press Wires Exempt
The provision exempts press!
leased wires and dispatches sent col
] lect by bona fide correspondents and
i radio leased wires. It does not ap- j
j ply to incoming cablegrams.
A tax of 10 per cent on admissions
j to places of amusement costing more
j than 46 cents, expected to yield $40,- j
! 000,000, was voted into the bill.
Secondary and high school athletic
events are exempted, but colleges and |
I universities, including the academies !
I at Annapolis and West Point, are j
not. Complimentary tickets to all
events also are taxed.
Throughout the day the House ac
! cepted a steady stream of committee |
proposals, with opposition melting 1
! before the appeals by committee I
members.
Garner Again Triumphs
At one time Speaker Garner took j
: the floor to urge the adoption of a
committee measure to tax corporate .
j incomes.
That was accepted, and during the |
j remainder of the day there was little '
i objection raised to the program of j
the committee until the postal raise
i came. The raise will become effee- j
' tive thirty days after the bill is ]
j signed by the President.
Passage of the bill by Friday night
' was indicated.
