LONDON, March 30. (IP)â€”Confi- !
dence in the American financial j
stituation was expi-essed today by j
j one of the highest financial authori- j
tics in Great Britain while prospects I
for a four-power conference here!
to discuss economic relief of the j
Danubian countries of Southeastern 1
Europe faded.
The financial authority, who would i
not permit his name to be used, said !
it was inconceivable that the dollar i
should go off Ihe gold standard. His I
j comment was on press reports cur- |
! rent the past few days of a "flight I
j from the dollar."
"There are all sorts of risks in j
I America, but there are no currency 1
risks," he said. "I can conceive of j
bank robberies, kidnapings, and
gang murders, but not of a col- I
lapse of the dollar."
