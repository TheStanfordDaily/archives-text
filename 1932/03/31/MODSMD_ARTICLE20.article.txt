### 
J N A MIGHTY EFFORT to prove to llic Interfraternity Board of Control
their willingness to co-operate in the matter of abolishing illegal rush
ing from Stanford the Interfraternity Council spent a two-hour period
last night working out a logical set of suggestions to the Board.
The chief desire of the Council is to persuade the Board to rescind it*
action and allow rushing of the Class of 1935 during this quarter. It is
hoped that if a workable program is presented for future use the Board
will consent to withdrawing the existing penalty and starting out the

♦ Class of 1936 with a clean slate.
Program Offered
A committee composed of Ike
Livermore, Wayne Ketron, and Jack
J Hinchliffe presented a program for
I rushing which they had worked out
! during the vacation. It was taken up
! for discussion and was finally adopt -
j cd by the Council as a resolution to
! be presented to the Board in the
I hope that il would influence a fa-
I vorable action.
j Four resolutions were adopted by
I the Council by a unanimous vote,
i expressing its policy. They will be
; presented to the Board at its meet
! ing next Wednesday. The first pro-
I vided that freshmen be acquainted
I with existing rules soon after regis
| tration and that there be an as
; sembly with house presidents, men
i eligible for rushing, and interfra
i ternity council officers present to
I insure perfect understanding,
j The second resolution changes
J rushing rules. A four-day period in
the last week in January will allow
: freshmen one date with each hou.se
: either for lunch or dinner. This will
be followed by a second four-day
period the last week in February
allowing two dates to each man
being rushed. Early in spring quar
ter there will be another period of
i four days again allowing two dates
| to each man. This will be followed
i by one week of open rushing before
! pledging. All hours are to be decided
;by the Interfraternity Board of
j Control.
New Penalties
In the third l'esolution penalties
I for illegal rushing are set forth. The
I first violation proved against a house
! would cause withdrawal of pledg
, ing privileges for one year. A sec-
I ond infraction of the rules would
cause the house to be decided by
! the Board of Control. Freshmen
l convicted for being on illegal rush
| ing parties would lose pledging
| privileges for one year.
The last resolution requires house
! presidents to give a pledge at the
' monthly meetings of the Interfra
ternity Council that their house had
I engaged in no illegal rushing during
! the past month. A motion was also
j carried providing for a fine of $10
I for not being present at meetings
i of the Council without excuse.
Expectations were current ihal
j the Interfraternity Board will take
1 action upon the Council resolutions

their willingness to co-operate in the matter of abolishing illegal rush
ing from Stanford the Interfraternity Council spent a two-hour period
last night working out a logical set of suggestions to the Board.
The chief desire of the Council is to persuade the Board to rescind it*
action and allow rushing of the Class of 1935 during this quarter. It is
hoped that if a workable program is presented for future use the Board
will consent to withdrawing the existing penalty and starting out the

♦ Class of 1936 with a clean slate.
Program Offered
A committee composed of Ike
Livermore, Wayne Ketron, and Jack
J Hinchliffe presented a program for
I rushing which they had worked out
! during the vacation. It was taken up
! for discussion and was finally adopt -
j cd by the Council as a resolution to
! be presented to the Board in the
I hope that il would influence a fa-
I vorable action.
j Four resolutions were adopted by
I the Council by a unanimous vote,
i expressing its policy. They will be
; presented to the Board at its meet
! ing next Wednesday. The first pro-
I vided that freshmen be acquainted
I with existing rules soon after regis
| tration and that there be an as
; sembly with house presidents, men
i eligible for rushing, and interfra
i ternity council officers present to
I insure perfect understanding,
j The second resolution changes
J rushing rules. A four-day period in
the last week in January will allow
: freshmen one date with each hou.se
: either for lunch or dinner. This will
be followed by a second four-day
period the last week in February
allowing two dates to each man
being rushed. Early in spring quar
ter there will be another period of
i four days again allowing two dates
| to each man. This will be followed
i by one week of open rushing before
! pledging. All hours are to be decided
;by the Interfraternity Board of
j Control.
New Penalties
In the third l'esolution penalties
I for illegal rushing are set forth. The
I first violation proved against a house
! would cause withdrawal of pledg
, ing privileges for one year. A sec-
I ond infraction of the rules would
cause the house to be decided by
! the Board of Control. Freshmen
l convicted for being on illegal rush
| ing parties would lose pledging
| privileges for one year.
The last resolution requires house
! presidents to give a pledge at the
' monthly meetings of the Interfra
ternity Council that their house had
I engaged in no illegal rushing during
! the past month. A motion was also
j carried providing for a fine of $10
I for not being present at meetings
