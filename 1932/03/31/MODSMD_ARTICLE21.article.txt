# Dink Urges New Emergency Rule In Pre-Olympics
## Coach Fears Poor Trials May Eliminate Stars 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 30. (/P) .
—Robert L. "Dink" Templeton, i
famed track and field coach of j
Stanford University, said today he j
thought some provision should be;
made so outstanding candidates for ■
the American Olympic Games team !
could be eligible for the team in i
case they had an off day during the j
trials and failed to qualify.
Templeton, in a hospital here re
covering from serious illness, of- :
fered the opinion in commenting on |
a suggestion made by Eddie Farrell, 1
Harvard coach, recently, that out
standing performers be exempted
from the tryouts.
The Stanford mentor does not fa
vor exemption. He considers the j
trials necessary as proper condi-j
tioning approaches to the games but j
feels some arrangements should j
exist to take care of emergencies.
"Take the case of Ben Eastman,
our quarter-miler," he said. "Ben j
set a new world's record of 46.4 in i
the 440 last Saturday and I look |
for him to crack the 880-yard rec-]
ord before the final Olympic trials, ]
July 15, 16. He is the greatest 440 |
runner in the world; yet it is pos- j
siblc he could fail to qualify for the
Olymuic team by having an off- j
time during the trials. Precedent to !
the contrary, this is where our sys- .
tern of selecting athletes is all >
wrong."
