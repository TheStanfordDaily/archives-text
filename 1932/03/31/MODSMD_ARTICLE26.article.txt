# A 						SINCERE EFFORT
## 
### 
Drastic changes in the rushing rules and stringent pen
alties for any infraction, passed last night at a meeting of
the Interfraternily Council, are sound evidence that the
fraternity men realize the seriousness of the present situa
tion and the immediate necessity for making the rushing
rules workable and enforceable.
Of more immediate interest is a petition passed by the
Council asking the Interfraternitv Hoard of Control to
rescind its action penalizing the houses by postponing rush
ing until next fall quarter, and allow the fraternities to
rush this spring.
That the fraternities were guilty of illegal rushing and
that the penalty was just in a strict sense is unquestionable.
Hut there are times when harsh justice might defeat its own
ends and moderation used to a better advantage.
In the lirsi place the mess last quarter and the resulting
penalty have made fraternity men realize as they never
have before the necessity for co-operating, both among
themselves and witii the administration and that illegal
rushing is a cut-throat proposition with results that can
only be disastrous. The spirit shown in last night's meet
ing was f'vidence of fact that the fraternities have become
conscious that rushing is not just a farce but should be con
trolled and regulated for the best interests of all.
That realization is the greatest good that can come from
the penally inflicted. If it is enforced, harmful results will
follow of which the housing situation and fraternity fi
nances are not small items. It might be argued that if the
penalty is rescinded, the same situation will occur next
year. However, the action and attitude of the fraternities
are ample proof that they are earnest in their desire to cor
rect the existing system and substitute one which they can
and will abide by.
Raising the penalty and allowing rushing this spring
quarter will eliminate many dilliculties and can have no
harmful consequences.
