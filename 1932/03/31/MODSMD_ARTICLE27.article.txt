"The last doubles match was called off when swarms
of mosquitos made it impossible for the players to con
tinue."
So reads an account of the Stanford-I.S.C. tenuis
matches last Saturday published in the Daily C.alifornian,
our shady contemporary up Berkeley way. No more dast
ardly, underhanded attack upon the fair name of this t'ni
versitv has ever been perpetrated. Were it not for the low
caste of its originator, drastic punitive action would be
imperatively demanded.
Note the calumnious insinuations of the sentence.
"Swarms of mosquitos* 1 implies that the Farm ranks with
New Jersey and Africa as a habitat of noxious insects. To
read the scurrilous C.alifornian one would think that pre
datory beasts make athletic contests no longer practicable
on our fair campus.
Hut the editor of the wretched Blue and Gold sheet is
so clearly unworthy of the notice of all self-respecting per
sons that to answer him would be to honor him far beyond
his deserts. Left to stew in his own vile spleen he will soon
eollapse through his utter impotence, and it is sufficient to
point out the snake so that he may be carefully avoided.
Mosquitos, forsooth !
