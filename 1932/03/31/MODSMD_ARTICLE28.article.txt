Nino "representative co-eds" at the University of Ne
braska wore interrogated last week in an effort to deter
inine what a co-ed thinks of male attire. The answers to
the question, "Do you personally object to a man who af
fects the following?" were: sideburns, ( .l yes; checked suits,
!) yes; berets, !) yes; the liatlcss mode, no; wrist watches,
!l no; ill-tilting clothes, <S yes. t no; no garters, yes, (i no;
bright neckties, f> yes, 'A no; scarf pins, (i yes, .'5 no; and
highly manicured nails, <S yes, 1 no.
Thus a man with sideburns but no wrist watch, wearing
an ill-titling chocked suit and a loud lie, and lopping oIV
the entire outfit with a fancy-looking beret appears to have
not a chance in this modern age.
A wise man once said, "Clothes don't make the man."
Abraham Lincoln, for example, wore sideburns. And il is
more than likely that he was occasionally seen in an ill
fitting chocked suit.
Then how, may we ask, do "representative co-eds" of
today ever expect to find themselves a groat man, if they
object to gentlemen who wear garb recognized as good
taste by one of the immortals of all time?
Things have come to a pretty pass!
