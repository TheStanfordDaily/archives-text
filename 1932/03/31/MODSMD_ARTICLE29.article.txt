# BULL SESSION
## MEN'S COUNCIL RUNS TRUE TO FORM 
### 
The Daily yesterday charged that
the Men's Council had been weak
kneed in failing to carry out the
terrible three quarter suspension
plan. It was not only weak-kneed—
it was knee-less. In fact it didn't
have a leg to stand on. The Council
gave forth an official apology to the
effect that cheating was prevalent in
this department and therefore the
severe penalty was omitted. Now,
all we have to do is make cheating
prevalent in all departments, and
no one will ever be suspended for
violation of the Honor Code.
The Council operates on the prin
ciple that if the student was so un
fortunate as to choose an honest
department, that's his hard luck. It
seems to us that cheating is cheat
ing—anywhere and any place. It is
something personal and has nothing
to do with what the professor or
classmates happen to be doing. I'll
bet those students who majored in
political science and who are now
on the outside waiting for three
quarters to roll around, wish they
had chosen some other department.
The Council has established the
precedent. Before you decide to
cheat, first determine how much
cheating is going on in your de
partment. If there is plenty, you
know the penalty—loo hours. If
your section of the Quad is honest,
you also know the penalty—three
quarters.

But from another standpoint, the
Council's action is not so vascillat

| ing. We must remember that the 1
Council that proclaimed the now i
historic "three quarter" manifesto is i
J not the present council which is
j enforcing it. Elections have inter- ,
i vened. Men were electcd to the;
j Council without any pledges. The j
student body had no way of know
! ing whether the men favored or dis-- |
I favored the Code —or whether they
' even knew that there was an Honor j
i Code. Now we are reaping the har
| vest of our blind votes.
i Of course, some will say that the i
| "three quarter" law was a tradition;
| but traditions without men
j to enforce them are as effective as ,
! a 1932 bathing suit in a Montana j
I snowstorm. That is not very ef- '
i fective. This campus knows the |
value of unenforced traditions — a i
• list of dead traditions around here '
I would stretch from the mast-head
j to the sports page, and back several |
j times.
But if we can excuse seeming |
judicial flabbiness on grounds of !
j elections, how can we excuse the I
| impotency of the decision? Instead J
! of stepping into an admittedly nasty j
: situation, the Council backs away'
j like a nervous horse that's been hit,
; on the nose with a red-hot poker. !
1 A new theory in administration of
j.justice —the worse the situation the
j lighter the penalty—remarkable, '
j spectacular, phenomenal, and above
: all, original. Hail the new judicial
I lights! May they burn forever and |
» ever .... —Abe Mellinkoff j
