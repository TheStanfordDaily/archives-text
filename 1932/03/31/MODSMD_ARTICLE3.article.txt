j With the Masque Ball rapidly ;

J evening of April 15 rolls around j
I with the Farm calendar, local con- j
| tenders for Queen's honors are talk- j
| ing things over. It seems to be the (
j general opinion that the prospec- ;
tive king will be either accepted;
or rejected according to his choice j
of running mate.
Keeping this in mind, various fac
tions are contemplating backing sev- |
j oral candidates in an attempt to,
' "keep the Queen on the Farm" . . . . ,
j which is the new "500" slogan this j
I season. And, by hook or by crook.
|.... it looks like she'll be kept here.

| formation which follows.

jhope): "I'll have to get the King
! for Roble!"
Mary K. Silver-Tongue" Morris
(D.G.'s yen to convince 'em): "JUST
; WAIT!! .... Until they hear me. i
Pauline "Valspar" Wilson (Today's j
i Model Kappa): "A shellac a day for j
j the Queen will pay .... what more j
' can I say?"
Jean "Oncc-a-Quecn" Jamison |

j set at $2.00 apiece, will carry 25 free
! votes each and the privilege to nomi- !
' nate a candidate. Although the vote I
i will be officially for the King, all 1
! Roughs running for that office must (
I announce their choice of mate be- !
! fore being placed on the ballot.
Blake and Amber will have cos- 1
