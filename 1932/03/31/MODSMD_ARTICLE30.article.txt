THE GOOD FAIRY. By Ferenc
Molnar, Kay Long antl Richard K.
Smith. New York, 1.932. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop).
There are some comedies which
do not lose their effectiveness if not
played. But Molnar's The Good
Fairy is not one of those.
Written far below the charming
Guardsman and The Play's the
Thing, this comedy may still be
amusing if very well produced in
deed.
Molnar extracts comedy by highly
improbable ruses and resorts to all i
sorts of frantic horseplay to make J
ridiculous misapprehensions amus
ing. His method seems to have been j
merely to have his characters say j
the most unexpected thing at a |
given moment. The play is, conse- \
quentlv, a paradoxical mixture of I
naivete and sophistication, non- j
sense and aged stage trickery. J
Even with wildly imaginative I
reading it is not continually funny, j
It must demand all the skill of Helen ]
Hayes and her supporting cast to
keep it on Broadway—where, inci
dentally, it has been for several
months now.
J. S. S.
AFTER TOMORROW—At the Var
sity Theatre.
This movie is a cocktail contain
ing "Street Scene," a dash of "Silver
Cord," and a happy ending.
"After Tomorrow" is seriously j
idealistic, being the story of two
young things, thwarted love, two
mothers and a father who do their
best to mess up their children's lives,
and money, all set in the depressing ;
atmosphere of New York's poorer ;
section.
Most interesting is the fact that
in spite of much dialogue involving
sex, Victorian principles of conduct j
govern the action and thought of i
the characters —all very refreshing
because of the sympathetic treat- 1
ment after the way that Hollywood
has fed its eccentric systems of
morality to us for so long.
Charles Farrell and Marian Nixon
do good work together, though they
could have been replaced by prac
tically >any other actor and actress
with just as pleasing results.
The shorts are good to indifferent.

FIREMAN SAVE MY CHILD—At
the New Stanford Theatre
In a role faintly reminiscent of
his "Elmer the Great," Joe E.
Brown again romps through another
of his unfailingly funny comedies,

j with his mouth open and his eyes
! closed. Joe is a small-town lad, with
| a genius at pitching, though his heart;
| is not in baseball, but in fire-fight- i
| ing. At the request of his fiancee he \
j accepts a big league offer in order i
Jto promote a fire extinguisher that ;
jhe has invented. Here he pitches '
; winning ball, with such minor in- :
j terruptions as fire engines, mustard
| plasters, and the disturbing influ
j ence of a blonde.
i Though it lags in the middle, the '
film comes up to a corking finish
! which will probably get you on the
J edge of your seat, despite the fact |
! that you know it will all turn out [
j all right. There's nothing particu
j larly original about this, and nothing
j great, but it carries a full quota of
I laughs, and Joe's last line has a
j "punch."
There is a short subject depicting i
Jci hazardous expedition into the in- j
I terior of Mongolia, alone worth the '
; price of admission. —E.C.

AFTER TOMORROW—At the Var
sity Theatre.
This movie is a cocktail contain
ing "Street Scene," a dash of "Silver
Cord," and a happy ending.
"After Tomorrow" is seriously j
idealistic, being the story of two
young things, thwarted love, two
mothers and a father who do their
best to mess up their children's lives,
and money, all set in the depressing ;
atmosphere of New York's poorer ;
section.
Most interesting is the fact that
in spite of much dialogue involving
sex, Victorian principles of conduct j
govern the action and thought of i
the characters —all very refreshing
because of the sympathetic treat- 1
ment after the way that Hollywood
has fed its eccentric systems of
morality to us for so long.
Charles Farrell and Marian Nixon
do good work together, though they
could have been replaced by prac
tically >any other actor and actress
with just as pleasing results.
The shorts are good to indifferent.

FIREMAN SAVE MY CHILD—At
the New Stanford Theatre
In a role faintly reminiscent of
his "Elmer the Great," Joe E.
Brown again romps through another
of his unfailingly funny comedies,

j with his mouth open and his eyes
! closed. Joe is a small-town lad, with
| a genius at pitching, though his heart;
| is not in baseball, but in fire-fight- i
| ing. At the request of his fiancee he \
j accepts a big league offer in order i
Jto promote a fire extinguisher that ;
jhe has invented. Here he pitches '
; winning ball, with such minor in- :
j terruptions as fire engines, mustard
| plasters, and the disturbing influ
j ence of a blonde.
i Though it lags in the middle, the '
film comes up to a corking finish
! which will probably get you on the
J edge of your seat, despite the fact |
! that you know it will all turn out [
j all right. There's nothing particu
j larly original about this, and nothing
j great, but it carries a full quota of
I laughs, and Joe's last line has a
j "punch."
There is a short subject depicting i
Jci hazardous expedition into the in- j
I terior of Mongolia, alone worth the '
; price of admission. —E.C.
THE GOOD FAIRY. By Ferenc
Molnar, Kay Long antl Richard K.
Smith. New York, 1.932. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop).
There are some comedies which
do not lose their effectiveness if not
played. But Molnar's The Good
Fairy is not one of those.
Written far below the charming
Guardsman and The Play's the
Thing, this comedy may still be
amusing if very well produced in
deed.
Molnar extracts comedy by highly
improbable ruses and resorts to all i
sorts of frantic horseplay to make J
ridiculous misapprehensions amus
