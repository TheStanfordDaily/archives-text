# VISITING ORGANIST TO PRESENT MUSIC OF OLDER MASTERS
## 
### 
In his organ recital this afternoon \
! at 5:10 o'clock in the Stanford Me- I
j morial Church Charles L. Safford, ;
I visiting organist, will give selec- j
I tions from the older masters.
One of the most interesting will j
! be Edward Batiste. He was a musi-
I cian of severe and unerring taste,
and one of the most noted organists
of his time, but his compositions j
were far from equalling his talents i
as professor and executant. He will j
be remembered chiefly for his edu- j
cational works, by his diagrams for ■
i reading music, and above all, by '
his accompaniments for organ or j
piano written on the figured basses j
! of celebrated solfeggo.
i The recital will offer the follow- •
I ing numbers:
j Choral Prelude, "Come, Holy
Spirit" J. S. Bach
| Prayer and Berceuse Guilmant
I Intermezzo Joseph Callaerts
; Offertory in D Edward Batiste
