The old saying about '"when
the cat is away . . was given
a reverse English this Spring ;
vacation when the students re
turned to find that the Adminis
tration had not been wasting its
time. Olt, no! Palm Drive is .
once more blocked. No one I
knows exactly what is happen- ■
ing but two of the workmen ad
mitted that they had employ
ment for life, i.e. if they don't
live too long.
The "gates' were not nearly as
effective in blocking traffic chuckles j
loth, as student after student
•rashes into the piles of dirt which
t is rumored will turn to mud at
he first April shower. The Admini
itration slipped up, however, when
hey failed to dig up the other en
rances to the campus—namely the
oad leading through Mayfield—
tround the air port—down the high
vay—to University Avenue; and the
oad down by the Stadium.
It's Spring and eccentricities
and innovations are to be for
given and all that but ....
What about these retl. white,
and blue outfits some of the
"500" are sporting? All they
have to do is slap a "Hoover"'
campaign poster on their backs,
and they couid pass any lfiO per
cent test. Pass some of them
whistling "America the Beauti
ful" or "Stars and Stripes" and
the girls get as red as a Fourth
of July orator describing the
third charge up Bunker Hill.
A man makes himself conspicuous
by being noisy and a co-ed makes
herself conspicuous by driving a
noisy car—or driving a car noisily.
Let one sorority on this campus take
note that people turn to look at them
to escape with limb and life and not
out of choice. It may be the pic
ture of youth—abandon to drop the
windshield, turn corners on two
wheels with rubber whining, and
all that .... but after all, girls,—
be yourself.
Some copy editor in Tuesday's
Daily indicated that Romeo and
Juliet was a "comedy." For that
"boot" he was severely chastized.
Some accused him of being a sadist.
Others who had had abnormal psych
hurled more syllabled words at him.
But unless there is some fancy
acting. Romeo and Juliet" in
the Stanford Assembly Hall will
not only be a comedy but an
hysterical farce. Lyons is good,
and Converse has a good repu
tation. Both will be put to the
acid, test in the balcony scene.
If no pennies fal! in (hat scene,
then they both are plenty good.

When in the course of human
events, the time comes when the
campus must be burdened with the
Junior Opera — usually written,
! acted, and managed by seniors—why
not use a few non-campus songs?
The best act in this year's "Big
Game Gaieties" was the last one
which used "good" music. The
weakest part of the Opera—since the
choruses started improving their
front-row appeal—is the music. It's
plenty good for student composers
! but not for student audiences. It
may not be patriotic to advocate off
campus music. But after all, the
Junior Opera is a musical produc
tion, not a patriotism endurance
race.
