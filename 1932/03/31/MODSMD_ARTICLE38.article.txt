ANOTHER "LAB" COURSE got
idcr way yesterday, with 85 re
>rting for the opening class. It was
me other than Pop Warner who
as in charge, and the course is
lown as Spring Football.
"We'll do considerable experi
enting this spring,'' Pop said in
s opening remarks to the squad.
have several brainstorms down
the old note book, and most of
tr offensive work will be with new
ays. We may have to change some
the plays a bit, but they should
nisiderably strengthen our of
nsive."
Pop always does a great deal of
cperimenting in the spring, but
ere will be unusual interest in
s laboratory this year because of
e much-discussed "double spin
■r" he is expected to introduce. He
st tried it in informal practice
iring winter quarter.
SCRIMMAGES will be held
each Friday afternoon, with the
other two sessions a week de
voted to fundamentals and sig
nal drill.
Despite rule changes affecting
(docking and tackling, Warner
doesn't expect much change will
he apparent in these depart
ments next fall. According to
one of the new rules, the hall
carrier is down whenever any
part of his body other than his
hands or feet touches the
ground, whether or not he is in
the grasp of an opponent.
Some expect that that will
make for sjoppy tackling—that
for the most part tacklers will
merely try to push the ball
carrier down. Pop doesn't share
that opinion, however.
"It won't make any real dif
ference in tackling," lie de
clared yesterday afternoon as he
gave personal attention to a
lengthy tackling drill for back
field men.
THE BLOCKING change, which
ohibits the use of the hands by
lesmen, is not expected to be ob
rvable from the stands.
Bill Corbus, Stanford's great all
ast guard, is all in favor of the
w rule. He expects it to eliminate
great deal of Ihe rough stuff that
>es on in the line, without funda
entally affecting play. "You never
ay so well anyway," Corbus said,
/hen the players get to using their
inds too much."
TANFORAN WILL vie with
Beresford for the attention of
horse lovers this afternoon. The
spring meeting of 39 dajs will
get under way at the San Bruno
track, while the Del Monte
Rangers will clash with the
Hurlingham four in a spectacu
lar polo match at San Mateo.
The Tanforan meeting is ex
ported to have unusual color
this year, many fast steeds hav
ing been shipped there follow
ing the closing of the Agua
Caliente track. Some $50 horses
altogether are now stabled there.
T n less there is some hitcTi,
Phar Lap. the great Australian
champion, is expected to pro
vide the biggest thrill of the
meeting in a special race tenta
tively set for the last of April.
Tins afternoon's polo event at
Beresford will find Cecil Smith
and Rube Williams, the colorful
Texas cowboys, playing the back
positions for Hurlingham.
The barrier will be sprung for
the first of eight races at Tan
foran at 2 o'clock, while the
polo match is slated for 2:30
o'clock.
SPEAKING OF polo, 'the two most
lorful riders in the West may be
en at Beresford on April 10. Plans
e being made for a return match
•tween the Rangers and a team
ptained by Eric Pedley, the only
icific Coast player ever to make
e international team.
11 arrangements for the match are
impleted, Will Rogers is expected
play No. 1 for the Pedley quartet.
Peoley, incidentally, is a former
an ford man. Stanford cannot
aim credit for having turned out
e great eight-goal player, how
'er, as poio had not yet been in
oduced on the Farm when Pedley
as a student here.
WILL BIG GAME tickets re
tail for $5.50 next year? They
may if a provision inserted by
the House yesterday in the pro
posed tax bill becomes a law.
The provision would place a tax
of 10 per cent on all amusements
costing more than 46 cents, in
cluding college sports.
Of course, the B.A.C. could
evade the tax by reducing the
price to If! cents! —L.M.C.
