ern science delving deep under the \
' dust of centuries, conjured up today j
I
■ a panoramic picture of prehistoric |
j man. The Oriental Institute of the i
i University of Chicago gathered to i
| sift the secrets of antiquity.
The explorers found early man, ;
with his loves, habits, and passions,
much like the modern version. The j
scientists surprisingly came upon 1
evidences of a murder. The crime ,
j had evidently not been solved by j
j contempories, leaving it to genera- j
| tions of the centuries to come to !
And in the remote ages before the
■ solve the riddle and "close" the case, j
| Sphinx had a secret, tax-fixing was !
■ discovered. Tablets told the story
J of the pre-Christian graft. The In- j
' stitute also heard evidences point- j
i ing to early hexing, and psychic
! fakcry. Instances of lust were dis- j
! covered. A murder was told of with i
j that for the motive.
Another scientist told of the alpha
, bet of 2500 B.C. Twenty-five letters
| have been found.
Dr. Bonner, Chicago physician, ex
| hibited a second amulet, which is,
' the only known example of the
I obstetric chair.
! Thus human nature goes on
j through the ages, a constant in a
j world of change.
