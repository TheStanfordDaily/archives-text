# S. C. Meet Definitely Set April 30
## TEMPLETON'S MEN LOOK BETTER FOR TRIANGULAR MEET Ike Hables Leaves Hospital; Werder Back In Shape; DeGroot Training 
### Dick Strouse 
Exactly 29 days remain before the
much-awaited Stanford-U.S.C. track
meet, it was revealed yesterday
when April 30 was definitely set as j
the final date for the annual Pa- j
cific Coast track classic. It will be j
held this year in Olympic Stadium. I
Los Angeles.
While much of the world eagerly j
awaits the next production of Dink j
Templeton's stupendous drama j
"How to Break Unbreakable Rec- J
ords," featuring Ben Eastman, the j
rest of the cast of the Templeton
play continues to rehearse for its
next showing on April 9. The Olym
pic Club and U.S.F. will face the !
Cards.
Hables Back
Dink's show promises to be even |
better than usual with the recovery
of one of the stars of numerous lo- i
cal performances. Captain "call me j
'Alvin'" Hables is out of the hos- [
pital, and already claims to be the |
best conditioned invalid on the j
cinder squad.
Ike's return to form, if and when \
it occurs, is again going to compli- j
cate the Farm relay situation. Les i
Hables, Lombardi, Paul Nash, and j
Eastman seemed to have cornered
the baton market, but now it will I
be the two Hables, Eastman, and
Lombardi or Nash. There is also:
a chance that Sam Eastman will
gain the coveted berth, and if he 1
does, Stanford's band, if it is still j
in existence, will be able to strike
up "When the Eastmans and the
Hables Get Together" whenever the
relay starts.
It is possible that a Palo Alto I
osteopath who never has won and
never will win a block "S" at Stan
ford will be responsible for some
Indian track victories this season, i
At any rate, the muscle manipu
lator has shoved a couple of Bill
Welder's vertabrae back into place,
and Werder now has the best of j
intentions of flinging his body hither
and yon with gravity-defying re
sults.
If Bert DeGroot's back doesn't
respond to campus treatment, he
will also try the Werder cure. Bert
has been out running but he is not
yet in any condition to pole-vault,
while Bill the third of the
Johns-Miller-DeGroot trio, is still >
incapacitated with a bad leg.
Timers Floored
Eastman, who is at the present
time running Herb Hoover a close i
race for the title of Stanford's most ■
famous student, has, like most prima i
donnas, been accused of lack of eti
quette. It seems that there is noth
ing in either Spaulding's track guide
or Emily Post's "Helpful Hints for
the Bashful"' making it proper for
a man (or woman) to break a 16-
year old world's record by a full
second.
In fact, Eastman's feat embar
rassed the official timers as much
as it did Gordon, Watson, and Lom- I
bardi when they tried to keep up
with him. As soon as the race was
over, there was another race to test
the stop-watches, and when they
were found in perfect condition,
Harry Maloney and his colleagues
shook their heads and said, "too
bad, guess the only thing lhat can
be done is to have the A.A.U. dis
prove the record on the grounds
that it's too fast to be true."

awaits the next production of Dink j
Templeton's stupendous drama j
"How to Break Unbreakable Rec- J
ords," featuring Ben Eastman, the j
rest of the cast of the Templeton
play continues to rehearse for its
next showing on April 9. The Olym
pic Club and U.S.F. will face the !
Cards.
Hables Back
Dink's show promises to be even |
better than usual with the recovery
of one of the stars of numerous lo- i
cal performances. Captain "call me j
'Alvin'" Hables is out of the hos- [
pital, and already claims to be the |
best conditioned invalid on the j
cinder squad.
Ike's return to form, if and when \
it occurs, is again going to compli- j
cate the Farm relay situation. Les i
Hables, Lombardi, Paul Nash, and j
Eastman seemed to have cornered
the baton market, but now it will I
be the two Hables, Eastman, and
Lombardi or Nash. There is also:
a chance that Sam Eastman will
gain the coveted berth, and if he 1
does, Stanford's band, if it is still j
in existence, will be able to strike
up "When the Eastmans and the
Hables Get Together" whenever the
relay starts.
It is possible that a Palo Alto I
osteopath who never has won and
never will win a block "S" at Stan
ford will be responsible for some
Indian track victories this season, i
At any rate, the muscle manipu
lator has shoved a couple of Bill
Welder's vertabrae back into place,
and Werder now has the best of j
intentions of flinging his body hither
and yon with gravity-defying re
sults.
If Bert DeGroot's back doesn't
respond to campus treatment, he
will also try the Werder cure. Bert
has been out running but he is not
yet in any condition to pole-vault,
while Bill the third of the
Johns-Miller-DeGroot trio, is still >
incapacitated with a bad leg.
Timers Floored
Eastman, who is at the present
time running Herb Hoover a close i
race for the title of Stanford's most ■
famous student, has, like most prima i
donnas, been accused of lack of eti
quette. It seems that there is noth
ing in either Spaulding's track guide
or Emily Post's "Helpful Hints for
the Bashful"' making it proper for
a man (or woman) to break a 16-
year old world's record by a full
second.
In fact, Eastman's feat embar
rassed the official timers as much
as it did Gordon, Watson, and Lom- I
bardi when they tried to keep up
with him. As soon as the race was
over, there was another race to test
the stop-watches, and when they
were found in perfect condition,
Harry Maloney and his colleagues
shook their heads and said, "too
bad, guess the only thing lhat can
be done is to have the A.A.U. dis
prove the record on the grounds
that it's too fast to be true."
Exactly 29 days remain before the
much-awaited Stanford-U.S.C. track
meet, it was revealed yesterday
when April 30 was definitely set as j
the final date for the annual Pa- j
cific Coast track classic. It will be j
held this year in Olympic Stadium. I
Los Angeles.
