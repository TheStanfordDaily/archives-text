# STANFORD PLACES IN FENCING MEET
## Pearman Wins Third Place Medal In Close Count 
### 
A fencing judge who couldn't i
count very accurately nearly spoiled
Stanford's record of placing a man j
in each A.F.L.A. Bay Division j
tournament on March 18, but when j
the number of touches scored
against each man in the novice epee
tournament were recounted, it was
found that Fred Pearman received
the handsome bronze medal for
third place.
The bouts resulted in Waffa, fenc
ing unattached, getting first by j
winning six and losing two. Pear
man, Ward (a California ineligible) j
and Edenholm of the Olympic Club j
tied for second, and Ward was given
second place and Edenholm third,
based on number of touches. But |
a more careful eount revealed that j
Pearman really had finished third, â– 
and the Card record remains intact, j
The Indians compete in the open
and team epee championships this
Friday at the Olympic Club, and j
hope to again cop the team title, j
This meet, as well as the junior i
epee tournament, was postponed j
from a date during vacation.
