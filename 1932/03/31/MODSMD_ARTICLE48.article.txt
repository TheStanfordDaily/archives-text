I Three infielder lettermen and two ,
pitchers, who won monograms last
spring, returned for service this j
year at the University of Southern ;
j California. With this as a nucleus ,
I Coach Sam Barry has had to fashion j
j an entirely new outfield and find a i
' catcher to replace Joe Ward, Troy's I
! stellar receiver for last year's outfit. |
j The returning lettermen are: Orv ;
| Mohler, shortstop, who led the j
' league in hitting last spring; A1 Hil- j
I debrand, third baseman; Captain i
| Garrett Arbelbide, first sacker; 1
i George "Buck" Buchanan, ace of j
'the hurling staff; and Johnnie Gooeh, |
i pitcher.
How well Barry has done his'
| work is borne out by the fact that j
j S.C. is at present leading the con-
I ference with eight victories, and ■
i three defeats.
Arbelbide in Field
The talkative first-baseman is now j
j holding down the left garden in
j creditable fashion, and in his place j
j at the initial sack is Curt Youel, a j
I left-handed performer. At third and j
j shortstop are Hildebrand and Moh- i
i ler, while at second base Bob Al- j
j laire, smooth-working shortstop of
| last year's freshman aggregation, i
: has fitted in nicely.
Besides Captain Arbelbide, the 1

I Three infielder lettermen and two ,
pitchers, who won monograms last
spring, returned for service this j
year at the University of Southern ;

I Coach Sam Barry has had to fashion j
j an entirely new outfield and find a i
' catcher to replace Joe Ward, Troy's I
! stellar receiver for last year's outfit. |
j The returning lettermen are: Orv ;

' league in hitting last spring; A1 Hil- j
I debrand, third baseman; Captain i
| Garrett Arbelbide, first sacker; 1
i George "Buck" Buchanan, ace of j
'the hurling staff; and Johnnie Gooeh, |

How well Barry has done his'

i three defeats.

The talkative first-baseman is now j
