# MERMEN RETURN TO CAMPUS
## 
### Maurice Rapf 
Preceding the arrival of their
teammates, John McKelvey and
John Gardner returned to school
yesterday from Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, where McKelvey captured the
50-yard dash title and Gardner took
fourth in the century to aid Stan- |
ford in grabbing second place in the J
National Collegiate swimming;
events.
Both men agreed that a few I
breaks in the right direction could
have won for Stanford, but they
also agreed that Michigan's swim
ming team is probably the most
powerful in America today. What
hurt the Cardinal chances most of
all was the fact that Michigan's
strength lay in the events in which
competition was the least strong,
while the Stanford potentialities
were centered around the short
free-style races where the strength
was more or less evenly divided.
It was also revealed that the meet
score, released in all newspapers
throughout the country, is an un
official one. The N.C.A.A. does not
recognize any team efforts in this
competition, the bestowing of honors
being confined to individual merits.
The score is similar to the one
adopted by newspapers for Olympic
Games events, where individual
winners determine the outcome.
This gives Stanford a certain
share of the glory for out of six
possible individual championships
the local mermen won three. Mc-
Kelvey led the field to the finish
in the 50-yard dash, Ted Wiget, a
sophomore, surprised with a victory
in the 440, and Austin Clapp swam
to a win in the 1500-meter race in
spite of the fact that he had not
trained for this event at all this
year.
Clapp and Captain Frank Booth
are now competing in the National
A.A.U. meet at New Haven under
the Hollywood Athletic Club's col
ors, while Wiget is representing the
Athens Club of Oakland.
