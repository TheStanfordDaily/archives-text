# JAPANESE DANGER TO U.S. FAR AWAY, SCHURMAN AVERS
## 
### 
If Japan's occupation of Man
churia is permanent, there is great j
danger to the United States of war
with her, Dr. Joseph Gould Schur- i
man, for four years minister to
China, declared yesterday at an all- j
university assembly.
'"At present there is absolutely no
danger to the United States,"' Dr. i
Schurman said. "True, Japan is a
first class military and naval power. I
But as a financial and economic I
power she is second rate.
Strength in Resources
''The temporary occupation of
Manchuria, in my opinion, makes j
little difference to the United States. j
But the indefinite military occupa- j
tion of Manchuria would create a !
grave situation, for Japan would !
then have the immense resources j
of coal, iron, and food which she '
now lacks."
Dr. Schurman traced the past his- i
tory of China leading up to the pres- 1
ent situation. Stressing the vastness !
of the country, he pointed out that |
over this immense area there is no j
governmental authority, the coun- j
try being ruled by war lords with 1
armies, who grant the nominal au- [
thorities only what power they wish. ]
Japan Has Motives
Two possible objects of Japanese j
agression in Manchuria were sug- i
gested by Dr. Schurman. Probably j
the most important, he said, is the '
desire to end the economic boycott i
against Japanese goods. The other
i.s the desire to settle three or four
hundred diplomatic controversies \
existing between the two govern- j
ments, which China has refused to
discuss.
Forty years ago, at the opening
of Stanford University, Dr. Schur- j
man gave a course of lectures here, j
he said. He was delighted to meet J
many of his former colleagues on 1
the campus.
