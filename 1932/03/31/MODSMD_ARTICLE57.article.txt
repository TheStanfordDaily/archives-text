##

Goethe's to be pre
| sen ted by the Department of Ger
! manic Languages in the Assembly
; Hall Friday evening at 7:30 o'clock
| in commemoration of the 100 th an
il niversary of the death of the au-
I thor, is the earliest version of the
i famous tragedy, "Faust," and difâ€”
; fers from the finished First Part of
I "Faust."
The drama reflects Goethe's strug
i gle with the mystery of evil in the
I world. The Faust of the "Urfaust"
I is a very different character from
I the Faust of the first published and
j the finished First Part. The Faust
j to be portrayed here Friday night
I lacks some of the dignity, nobility,
j and seriousness of purpose that the
1 later Faust possessed.
I The manuscript of the "Urfaust,"
I though it dates back to 1775, was
' not published till 1887 when it was
i discovered in the possession of
! Louise von Goechhausen, a lady at
j the Court of Weimar.
Production of the "Urfaust" is
under the direction of Dr. Kurt
Heinhardt, associate professor of
j German, and rehearsals have been
j held bi-weekly since October.
