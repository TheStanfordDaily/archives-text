# INDIAN FROSH NINE PLAYS BEAR CUBS SATURDAY AT U.C.
## 
### 
Headed by the newly elected cap
tain, Jim Woolley, the Stanford
j freshman ball club will pack up the
j bats and travel to Berkeley Satur
j day morning to play the powerful
: University of California nine in the
' first game of the Little Big Series.
! The babes will meet their strong
est opponents of the season when
they face the Bear Cubs. The year
lings from Berkeley have enjoyed
a winning season, while the Stan
ford outfit has suffered continual
defeats; the baby Redskins, how
ever, have improved their style of
; play during the progress of the sea
' son and now display a brand of ball
I that should smash the California
| defense.
California's winning power lies in
| the brilliant Jack Gilbert, star
j moundsman, with a smooth-running
i team to back him. Fred Heringer,
regular twirler, who will be the
likely choice for the pitcher's box,
will probably turn the game into a
pitching duel. If Heringer goes into
! the box, Coach Murray Cuddeback
' | will place Al Semmelroth, twirler,
| on third, and will hold him in re
j serve for possible use as relief
j hurler.
J Providing the line-up is not shot
I to pieces by the absence of regulars,
S the frosh, by their lately impressive
' j style of play, should place the much-
| victorious California team in a most
j uncomfortable position.
