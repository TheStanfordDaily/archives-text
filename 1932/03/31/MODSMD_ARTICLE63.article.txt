# LINDBERGH GUARD SEARCH PLANS
## 
### 
NORFOLK, Va., March 30 (/P).â€”
"Watchful waiting" was the term
used this afternoon by Rear Admiral
Guy H. Burrage, retired, to describe
present activities of three Norfolk
men seeking to restore the kidnaped
Lindbergh baby to his parents.
Assuming the role of spokesman
for Very Rev. H. Dobson-Peacock, j
John Hughes Curtis, boat builder,
and himself, the naval officer said
"if there is failure in the Norfolk
negotiations the kidnapers, and they
alone, will know why."
Asked for a possible reason for
delay in their negotiations, he re- -
plied: "You might say the kidnap
ers arc afraid to go to Colonel Lind- '
bergh with the child. That's a rea
sonable answer."
He admitted the possibility the
negotiators were following a false
hope with the statement that "every
body is sometimes misled," but when
asked whether he believed the baby I
was alive, said: "Unquestionably we
wouldn't be working if we thought
the baby was dead."
