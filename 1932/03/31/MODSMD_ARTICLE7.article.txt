WASHINGTON, March 30. (/I 5 ) —
Characterizing the flexible provi- |
sions the "longest single step toward •
scientific tariff making ever taken j
by Congress," Senator Fess of Ohio I
today continued the Republican de- '
fense of that section of the law. The
Democrats are seeking to repeal it. j
Fess, chairman of the Republican j
National Committee, said to have j
Congress instead of the President I
act on recommendations of the tariff !
commission as proposed in the j
Democratic measure, would encour- )
age "log rolling."
He said the chief purpose of the I
flexible provision was to take tariff j
out of the range of log rolling and j
to prevent the disturbance to busi- !
ness resulting from general tariff I
revisions.
