# BIOLOGY QUARTERS EQUIPPED FOR USE OF PHYSIOLOGY LAB
## 
### 
With the transfer of the Depart
ment of Biology from the Physiology
Building to its new quarters in the
Zoology wing, the former biological
laboratories are being completely
renovated and equipped for use by
the physiology department.
An anonymous gift of $4000 for
laboratory equipment is being used
to carry on this work. It has been
possible to buy a few pieces of spe
cial equipment for the new labora
tories from the fund, and the de
partment hopes to be able to buy
a fleuroscope x-ray machine soon.
Dr. Martin, head of the biology
department, states that the new
laboratories, when completed, will
be the equal of anv in the count rv.
