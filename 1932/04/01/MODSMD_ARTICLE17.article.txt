### HARRY McMASTERS 
Criticizers of the House of Repre-
sentatives for its action in defeating j
the sales tax were censured yester
day by Professor Thomas S. Bar- j
clay, who returned from Washington :
Wednesday.
The defeat of the bill can be j
largely attributed to more liberal j
rules and greater freedom of de- j
bate, which Democratic leaders I
have long urged and which were j
inaugurated when Garner became j
Speaker, Professor Barclay said.
"It is strange that a legislative j
body should be criticized for re
storing some of the fundamental
features of true representative gov
ernment," he said.
Concerning the-presidential cam
paign, Professor Barclay said: "It is j
exceedingly dangerous to make po
litical predictions in advance, but
present indications point strongly to
the nomination of Governor Roose- j
velt."
Nomination of Roosevelt will oc
cur early in the balloting, Professor
Barclay believes, for the leaders ol I

the Democratic party are determined ;
to avoid a recurrence of the unfor-j
lunate situation in the 1924 conven- j
tion, he said.
"My opinion is that Newton D. i
Baker, who is admirably qualified [
for the presidency, will be nomi- i
nated if Governor Roosevelt is not [
successful," he said. "However, one !
can never be sure what a Demo- I
cratic national convention will do." I
Professor Barclay lauded the sup- }
port given by the Democrats to re- i
lief measures proposed by the ad- !
ministration. "The Democratic lead- i
ers, in and out of Congress, have j
displayed an admirable spirit of co- I
operation with the administration," ■
he said. "Their actions stand in sug- j
gestive contrast to thv treatment |
accorded the late President Wilson !
by the leaders of the Republican i
party at a former critical period."
Professor Barclay was in Wash- |
ington during the past quarter
studying the Speakership of the
House for the period from 1911 to i
1919.
