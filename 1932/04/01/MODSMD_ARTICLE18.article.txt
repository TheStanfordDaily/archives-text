### 
Representing Stanford's contribu
tion to the world-wide observation
of the 100 th anniversary of the death
of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
will be the presentation of his "Ur
faust" in German by the Depart
ment of Germanic Languages to
night at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall. No admission is to be charged,
and no seats will be reserved.
The cast of the tragedy is com
posed of students and faculty mem
bers of the German department and
is as follows:

Martha Artha Gordon

Scenes Impressionistic
Settings for the sixteen scenes of
the "Urfaust" have been arranged
under the direction of Gerrit de
Jong. They are impressionistic
rather than realistic. Costumes have
been rented from Goldstein's in San
Francisco, and are those used by
the San Francisco oP era Company
in its production of Gounod's opera,
"Faust."
A choir of eight students will sing
Thomas Cellano's "Dies Irae" during
the cathedral scene.
Is Earliest Version
The "Urfaust" is the earliest ver
sion of Goethe's sublime tragedy.
Although it was written in 1775, it
was not published until 1887. Its
main difference from the first pub
lished and the finished First Part of
'"Faust" lies in the character of its
Faust. Faust, whose life is a re
flection of the author's own struggle
with the evil of the world, changed
as Goethe himself changed and grew
older.
Following its presentation here
the "Urfaust" will be given in San
Francisco on April 27 under the
auspices of the German Club of San
Francisco.
