# MONTH OF SEARCH
## 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., March 31. (/P.)â€”
A month of searching throughout
the world for the kidnapped Charles
Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., ended to
night with apparent proof of his
safety and whereabouts still lacking.
Thousands of ''tips" have been in
vestigated. Automobiles in all parts
of the country have been stopped
on suspicion. Hundreds of houses
have been searched. Many a sus
pect has been questioned. Babies by
the dozens have been found bearing
a striking resemblance to the miss
ing boy.
Underworld Aid Fails
Federal, state, county, city, and
village officers saw the month
drawing to a close with their efforts
still in vain. At least four under
world characters who were pro
jected one after another into the
case likewise had met no apparent
success.
Hope the blue-eyed boy may still
be returned to his parents has been
revived by statements of three Nor
folk, Va., residents that they had
made contacts with the kidnappers.
But in spite of two airplane trips by
the Virginians and two conferences
with Colonel Lindbergh here, no
indication has come from the fam
ous flier that he looks for success
from that quarter.
State police have repeatedly ex
pressed belief there is "no specific
significance" to that angle of the
case and have quoted Colonel Lind
bergh as saying the same thing.
