on stock transactions to yield $75,-
000,000 and making administrative
changes on credits for losses in mar
ket trading to yield $100,000,000.
Open for Changes
Although leaders felt that with
expected savings in government ex
penditures the bill would fwrnish
revenue adequate to meet an an
ticipated $1,241,500 treasury deficit
in 1933, they kept the bill open for
further amendment to meet any un
expected shortage. They awaited a
revised estimate of the yield of the
entire bill requested by the Ways
and Means committee from Secre
tary Mills.
Savings in appropriations and
postoffice administration changes are

state the defeated $600,000,000 manu
facturers' sales tax provision that

Acting Chairman Crisp of the com
mittee he would demand a record
vote on the 2.25 per cent provision.
It was defeated last week 223 to
153, on a teller vote.
Through an amendment by Crisp
adopted shortly before the House
adjourned, all special excise taxes
inserted as substitutes for the sales
tax would become effective 15 days
after President Hoover signs the bill
and terminate July 1, 1934.
As the House adjourned Crisp
said: "I see no reason now why in
the world this bill cannot be dis
posed of by tomorrow."
The Gcoi'gia Democrat said a sub
committee would go over the meas
ure before morning to see whether
any additional revenue was needed.
The way was left open for the of
fering of any further amendments
to make up any sum necessary.

WASHINGTON, March 31 (/P).—
A weary but determined House
pushed the total of the new revenue
bill up to $999,000,000 today and
girded itself for a final battle over
the sales tax and other levies be
fore final passage is reached to
morrow.
With a united effort it approved
sales tax substitutes offered by the
Ways and Means committee amount
ing to $255,500,000 including a levy
on stock transactions to yield $75,-
000,000 and making administrative
changes on credits for losses in mar
ket trading to yield $100,000,000.
Open for Changes
Although leaders felt that with
expected savings in government ex
penditures the bill would fwrnish
revenue adequate to meet an an
ticipated $1,241,500 treasury deficit
in 1933, they kept the bill open for
further amendment to meet any un
expected shortage. They awaited a
revised estimate of the yield of the
entire bill requested by the Ways
and Means committee from Secre
tary Mills.
Savings in appropriations and
postoffice administration changes are
expected to total $272,500,000, bring
ing the whole to $1,271,500,000. With
this in prospect a surplus of $30,-
500,000 appears in the ofiing.
