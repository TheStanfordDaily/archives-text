# BAILEY HEADS CAST FOR "SILVER CORD" SHOWING TOMORROW
## 
### 
Dr. Margery Bailey will be seen
again in the leading role of Sidney
Howard's "Silver Cord" tomorrow
evening at the Palo Alto Union
High School auditorium. With one
exception, Corinne Elkins, all the
members of the cast are well known
on the campus.
"The Silver Cord" was first pre
sented by the Palo Alto Community
Theatre on February 15 and 16. At
that time the critical comment was
quite divided concerning it but, as
far as the production tomorrow
night goes, it should benefit greatly
by new scenery, a larger auditorium,
and more rehearsals.
The complete cast of the play is
as follows:
Mrs. Phelps Margery Bailey
Robert Phelps Robert Brauns
David Phelps Richard Ogg
Christina Corinne Elkins
Hester Peg Randall Converse
Maid Vivienne Church
Dr. Margery Bailey, Peg Converse,
and Robert Brauns have all been
cast by Harold Helvenston in the
forthcoming campus production of
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet."
