# Eastman, Jones Show Fine Form In Daily Trials
## Blazing Ben Runs 352 In 36.4 To Crack Record; Gives Lombardi Ten Yard Handicap And Wins By Fifteen; Former Mark Is 36.5 GIBERSON ALSO RUNS FAST 352 TO BEAT NASH Bob Jones And Here Laborde Throw Discus Over 155 Feet; Look Forward To I.C.4-A. Title 
### DICK STROUSE 
STANFORD'S two 1.C.4-A. champions showed why they were the best
in the country 111 their respective events last year and will be again
this year when they both performed in better than their best fashions
yesterday afternoon. Bob Jones, the Indian discus-thrower who was
undefeated in collegiate competition last season, swung bis trusty right
arm thrice yesterday, and each time it sent a small wood and iron plate
some 157 feet or better through the air. while Ben Eastman stepped out
to run .'552 yards in 36.4 seconds. Jone's achievement is particularly en
couraging, as until yesterday he had found that high-jumping had in
terfered with bis discus-throwing and bad not reached his best mark

-of last year. Jones' farthest heave
j was good for about 158 feet 6 inches
j yesterday, which is within a foot ot
1 his best mark in competition.
Here Laborde, who has been beat
! ing Jones this season, also felt, good
j and got the platter beyond the 156-
! foot mark once, and between 154
I and 155 feet 011 two other occasions
yesterday. All of which is as it
| should be, and gives Stanford the
I two best discus-throwers in the
| country.
Another Eastman Record
Eastman's mark of 36.4 for a 352
| breaks whatever world's record
[exists in this distinctly Templeton
! event. Back in the early stages of
| the 1931 season, when Les Hables,
| with his arms waving wildly about
| his facc and his feet waving as
I wildly above the cinders, recorded
' 36.5, everyone thought that the ul
i timate in sprinting had been
I achieved.
Eastman tied Hables' mark last
j year and again earlier this season,
' and yesterday, although running on
the outside of the track, he knocked
1 a precious tenth of a second from
! the record. Ben gave Frank Lom
] bardi ten yards and beat him by
I seven, simply eating up the distance
i that separated him from the runner
; who is supposed to have the most
, perfect sprinting form in the world.
Giberson Looks Good
1 Ralph Giberson also took a crack
j at the 352, which is theoretically the
: longest distance that a human can
| sprint. Gibey recorded 38.8, which
j would be real news if Eastman did
n't happen to be a member of the
I same track team.
Yet, good as are Eastman, Hables,
i Giberson, and Lombard!, a new
I threat had appeared to question
! their supremacy in the dashes. He is
I Nellie Gray, a noted Card shot
putter, who took down the rest of
| the other Indian weight men in a
j speedy 10-flat 50-yard dash.
Will Watch Trojans
All those Stanford tracksters whu
I can afford a trip to Berkeley will
j journey up there tomorrow aftcr
j noon to watch Dean Cromwell's
I Trojans set a new high scoring rec-
I ord while trouncing Brick Morse's
| and Walter Christie's Bears. Morse's
i best eloquence and Christie's finest
j strategy will hardly be enough to
stem the Trojan attack.
| Ellington and his men will be par
! ticularly interested in the condition
Jof Dick Barber and Bill Graber,
; both of whom are reported hurt,
j And it will be worth a trip to even
j California to watch WykofT and
; Kiesel hook up in their much-pub
; licized sprinting duel.

STANFORD'S two 1.C.4-A. champions showed why they were the best
in the country 111 their respective events last year and will be again
this year when they both performed in better than their best fashions
yesterday afternoon. Bob Jones, the Indian discus-thrower who was
undefeated in collegiate competition last season, swung bis trusty right
arm thrice yesterday, and each time it sent a small wood and iron plate
some 157 feet or better through the air. while Ben Eastman stepped out
to run .'552 yards in 36.4 seconds. Jone's achievement is particularly en
couraging, as until yesterday he had found that high-jumping had in
terfered with bis discus-throwing and bad not reached his best mark

-of last year. Jones' farthest heave
j was good for about 158 feet 6 inches
j yesterday, which is within a foot ot
1 his best mark in competition.
Here Laborde, who has been beat
! ing Jones this season, also felt, good
j and got the platter beyond the 156-
! foot mark once, and between 154
I and 155 feet 011 two other occasions
yesterday. All of which is as it
| should be, and gives Stanford the
I two best discus-throwers in the
| country.
Another Eastman Record
Eastman's mark of 36.4 for a 352
| breaks whatever world's record
[exists in this distinctly Templeton
! event. Back in the early stages of
| the 1931 season, when Les Hables,
| with his arms waving wildly about
| his facc and his feet waving as
I wildly above the cinders, recorded
' 36.5, everyone thought that the ul
i timate in sprinting had been
I achieved.
Eastman tied Hables' mark last
j year and again earlier this season,
' and yesterday, although running on
the outside of the track, he knocked
1 a precious tenth of a second from
! the record. Ben gave Frank Lom
] bardi ten yards and beat him by
I seven, simply eating up the distance
i that separated him from the runner
; who is supposed to have the most
, perfect sprinting form in the world.
Giberson Looks Good
1 Ralph Giberson also took a crack
j at the 352, which is theoretically the
: longest distance that a human can
| sprint. Gibey recorded 38.8, which
j would be real news if Eastman did
n't happen to be a member of the
I same track team.
Yet, good as are Eastman, Hables,
i Giberson, and Lombard!, a new
I threat had appeared to question
! their supremacy in the dashes. He is
