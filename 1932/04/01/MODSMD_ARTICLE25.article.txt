to light the news that Gordon
Heche's orchestra has been engaged
to play the evening of April 15 for
the masked kings and queeners of
Stanford. Heche will have a ten

honors. All nominees must be placed
on the ticket by someone who has
purchased an invitation. Twenty-five
free votes are given with each bid
and extra counts may be had for one
cent apiece.
Kings Have Queens
Latest news from the local front
indicates that some of the Farm
celebrities are already pairing up for
action in the events during election
week. Modest couples, somewhat
bashful before the press, finally ad
mitted some of the following pecu
liarities.
Marion "Honey - babe" Reich
(Branner's Kaweeen): "Just Queen
for a day, but I'm simply wild about
King Maxie .... he's so cute!"
Maxie "W 011 a 111 a 11" Powers
(Keepme Awful Thilly's funster):
"I may be king, but wotta queen
Marion will make!"
Kahn Wants Harris
In a radical attempt to promote
the Class of '35, various freshman
factions have put up Marvelous
"Duck-Billed'" Kahn as running
mate for Eleanor "Hey-Hcy" Harris
(also known as Hollywood Terror,
etc.). Kahn declined to make a
statement, but "Hey-hcy" merely
said "Marvie's MY king, and the
rest of the 500 will have to take him
too!"
As April 15 is drawing nearer and
nearer, prospective masqueraders
for the evening are wondering what
to wear. For those who do not pos
sess disguises, costumes will be on
display the week of the Ball in the
Pavilion every day. They will be
rented at reasonable rates for the
evening.
