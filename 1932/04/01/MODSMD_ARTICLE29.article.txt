luesdav four students asked a professor for the fa- ;
miliar blue cards that they might sign up in liis course, j
Imagine their surprise when he told them that he would :
not grant what he evidently considered a favor the honor
dI taking a course from him simply because registration
day was not Tuesday, but Monday. I'pon investigation,!
those students discovered that the class was not officially!
limited, and that their presence in it would work no par
ticular hardship upon anyone.
1( is diflicult to understand the hostile attitude of certain
professors in this university towards students who desire!
to register in their classes a day or so late.
Perhaps il is an indication that the well-known "teach-j
ors complex" so prevalent in high school is menacing!
Stanford. Ihe typical prep school instructor opposes the!
wishes ot the students as a matter of policy, running his 1
classes on a straight-jacket schedule and sticking to it re
gardless of conditions or reason. Enable to justify his dog
matism, he rationalizes his way out of it by the handy ex
cuse that high school students are 100 young and irrespon- 1
sible to think for themselves. Me doesn't seem to realize!
that the only way adolescents can learn to do that is by!
practicing it.
II is commonly agreed that progression in education
points toward more responsibility on the part of those seek
ing knowledge. Chicago I'niversilv, for example, is hailed
as a pioneer in Ibis direction, and has received the praise
of the country's best thinkers for its new plan, which dis
penses with all regulation, abolishing class systems and
letting the student gain what education he will, when he
will, and how he will.
The administration of Stanford allows for late registra
tion. True, il exacts a fine of two dollars per day for the
privilege -nevertheless it grants il. It realizes thai often it
is impossible for a student to be here on a certain dale. It
also realizes that certain conditions often make late regis
tration in classes unavoidable; indeed, that the very set-up
of wholesale educating facilities often makes if even de
sirable. That is why it grants the privilege of changing
study lists within two weeks of enrollment, or even later
upon payment of a fine.
Why, then, in the name of everything sacred, should
certain professors here lake it upon themselves to bar late
registering students from their classes with no other justi l
fication than that it is against their personal policies of
punctuality? Surely they cannot believe that by so acting
they can instill into students that admirable quality of their
own.
Perhaps if has never occurred to them that some of the
wiser students on this campus consider six or eight courses
and then go around to all of them during the first three
days of t! e quarter. Through Ibis procedure, they can
choose the ones they want to lake with a knowledge of
what they are doing, and of what they are getting for their
JfW) or *11 », whichever il might be. Even the professors in
question, if asked, would undoubtedly admit that they
would not buy a $2,000 car simply by picking out some un
known brand from the pages of a catalogue and ordering
il delivered without either seeing or testing it.

will, and how he will.
The administration of Stanford allows for late registra

privilege -nevertheless it grants il. It realizes thai often it
is impossible for a student to be here on a certain dale. It
also realizes that certain conditions often make late regis
tration in classes unavoidable; indeed, that the very set-up
of wholesale educating facilities often makes if even de
sirable. That is why it grants the privilege of changing
study lists within two weeks of enrollment, or even later
upon payment of a fine.
Why, then, in the name of everything sacred, should
certain professors here lake it upon themselves to bar late
registering students from their classes with no other justi l
fication than that it is against their personal policies of
punctuality? Surely they cannot believe that by so acting
