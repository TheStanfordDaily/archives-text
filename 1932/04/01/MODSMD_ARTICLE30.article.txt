For more llian a year and a half the Daily lias been
the eonslant advocate of inter-collegiate competition in
women's athletics, believing that it was sponsoring the
cause of the women of the I'nivcrsity. The Daily was
wrong! The women do not want inter-collegiate competi
tion. The women, not the physical education department,
are to blame for the present stay-at-home condition of
athletics at the Roble gymnasium.
Although team sports are still taboo in inter-collegiate
competition, the physical education department is not ac
tively opposed to competition in the fields of tennis and
golf where the initiative rests with the individual players.
The Dmi.v urged that the W.A.A. Hoard ask for per
mission to invite golf and tennis players from nearby col
leges to compete with Stanford women. The W.A.A. Hoard
did nothing, and has continued to do nothing.
If the women are really in favor of inter-collegiate
sports, let them prove it. Eel them ask for permission to
compete in golf and tennis, instead ol waiting passively lor
Ihe physical education department to grant that permission
of its own accord. Let them tight for their rights in Ibis
instance, and team sports will eventually lake care of
I hemst'lyes.
