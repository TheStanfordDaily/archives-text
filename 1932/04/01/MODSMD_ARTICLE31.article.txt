# BULL SESSION
## "65" AND OUT 
### 
What happens to Stanford profes
sors? Well, .some of them die. Some
are grabbed off by Harvard and the
rest are retired at the age of G5.
There is no question raised as to
physical condition or intellectual
enthusiasm. The law is arbitrary—
it runs by the calendar and not by
individual cases. It probably owes
its inception to the Rotariaja ideal
of the bustling business man that
has swept the nation with increas
ing vigor. Pep—bang —young blood
is the modern cry and therefore
Stanford professors must be retired
at G5.
Now, some physical strength .is
needed by the professor; he must
be able to stand on his two legs
and speak loudly enough that all
can hear without difficulty. It is
also desirable, but not indispensable,
that the professor be able to give
the physical appearance of being
really alive and not merely leaning
heavily on the thread of life.
That many men can fulfill all
these requirements at 65 is quite
evident. Prime example number one
is of course President Hindenburg
who was over 65 when the World
War began; but while few maintain
his physical vigor at 84, many do
at 70 and better. Why not judge
each professor's physical ability by
his physical ability and not by two
arbitrary digits?
Intellectually, the case is even
better against the 65 limit. Many

are the old professors who exude
more enthusiasm over the subject
than many young instructors work
ing for their Ph.D. As far as know
ing their lield —and being able to
grasp the student's view in pre
senting it—there is no decreasing
ability with advancing age. The
dead personality and the musty
brain are evident in the college
senior; they do not need age in
which to nurture and bloom.
Of course, if hosts of youthful
brilliants were being forced out of
Stanford's faculty by old-timers,
there might* be some argument for
the present practice. Such does not
seem to be the case. By the ruthless
enforcement of this rule, however,
Stanford is yearly being deprived
of many men who still have years
of valuable teaching before them.
All that is old is not necessarily
the best. But that does not mean
that all that is old is necessarily
inferior. It would be much better to
make the 05 rule optional. Retire
professors at 65 or even at 60 if
their intellectual or physical condi
tion demands it. But when they still
have all the qualities that make the
best professors plus the experience
of age, it is, indeed, wasteful folly
to open the door and point a re
lentless forefinger.
Hear an address from some of the
"Emeritus" professors or some that
soon will be, and then judge.
