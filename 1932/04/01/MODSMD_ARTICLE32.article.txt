RACKETY RAX—By Joel Sayrc. |
Alfred A. Knopf. New York, 1!)32.
$1.50. (At Ihe Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
A delicious satire in which
"Knucks" McGloin, New York's
biggest racketeer, decides to muscle
in on the football racket and get a
slice of the gate receipts from in
tercollegiate football. Accordingly,
Canarsie University is founded, with
no student body or faculty but with
a winning team composed of boxers j
and wrestlers. And you just have
to read the book to get the full
beauty of their football tactics.
Accompanied by a rooting section \
of mobsmen and chorines appropri
ately dressed in puce and green, the
school colors, Carnasie toured the
country unbeaten for three years.
Among others, Leland Stanford is
dropped to the tune of 35 to 0. It
all sounds beautifully plausible.
Finally comes trouble when A1
Capone decides it is a good racket
and establishes Lake Shore Tech.
What follows is described by the
blurb on the jacket as "a game
which would have made the Ar
gonne sound like a tea party," and
for once we agree wholeheartedly
with the writer. It must have been
a pleasant surprise for him to find a
book about which he could tell the
truth and give his overworked ima
gination a rest.
The pictures by Alan Dunn, who
illustrates for the New Yorker, are
almost half the story. If you read
the book do look at the last one,

I
which is priceless. Of course, if you
don't like that sort of humor ....

COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW — By El
mer Rice. Samuel French. New
York. $2. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
Like "Street Scene," "Counsellor
at-Law" has a polt which slowly
emerges from a mass of detail which,
in this case, accompanies the bustle
in and out of the office of a suc
cessful lawyer. It is a well-written
melodrama which, fortunately, does
not become sentimental. It is a play
for a star, the lawyer George Simon,
about whom center the many little
picture-incidents which build the
slender plot to playing proportions
and make the busy office real.
Elmer Rice has, with extreme
skill, constructed a play which, al
though action is limited almost to
opening of doors and lifting of tele
phones, sustains interest from first
curtain to last.
The characters are, with the ex
ception of Simon, not as well-drawn
as those in Street Scene. Rice has
allowed himself to caricature more
here. The children are, for example,
| miserably precocious little snobs al
most as unbelievable as the prodigic
infant in Carl Van Vechten's "Fire
crackers."
The play is excellent theatre in
, the "Grand Hotel" manner but
somewhat superior—if less spec
tacular—to that amazing if uncon
vincing hokum by which Vicki

' Baum is known to this country.

THE EPIC OF AMERICA — By
James Truslow Adams. $.'l. (At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"Epic of America" is as well
! named as any book published in
! years. With sweeping magnificance,
j it tells the stirring history of our
I continent, producing a distinct pa
triotic reaction in the reader. This
: latest of James Truslow Adams' his
! Tories is one of the few recent non
j fiction books that once started can't
! be put down.
! History couldn't be as simple a
thing as Adams makes it out to be,
i but perhaps he is justified in not
\ being too involved in order to point
! his thesis. The whole work is an
| attempt to give the origin, history,
and probable future of America's
| false ideal of education, her political
j ideal of the citizen as ruler, and her
I muddling of morals by having given
| business success the rank of a moral
| virtue. —J.H.F.
