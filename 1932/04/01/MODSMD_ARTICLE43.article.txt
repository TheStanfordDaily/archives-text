ANYWAY, SAM EASTMAN
swears it's true. Ben's strawberry- |
topped brother decided to let his .
stop-watch run dqfcvn the other j
night, just a night or so after Ben's '
famous run. Sam placed the watch
on his bureau, put out the cat, said
his prayers, turned out the light,
and soon his melodious snore filled
the Alpha Delt house.
The next morning the watch had I
stopped. Where had it stopped? At j
4G.4 seconds!
. f .
I
IF YOU are looking for some- |
thing ''different" to do this
week-end, drive down to Del |
Monte Sunday, where the major
attraction will he a steeplechase
in the afternoon. There are
those who claim there is no more
thrilling sport under the sun.
If that's too far away, another
great polo match is on tap for
Beresford. Cecil Smith and
"Rube" Williams will again he
featured, playing with the Han
ger quartet against the Castro
Valley four. This afternoon Cas
tro Valley and Cypress Point 1
will clash in the finals of the j
open championship.
WITH STANFORD resting, track I
interest will swing to the California- j
Southern California meet at Berke- |
ley tomorrow afternoon, which will ;
dedicate California's new $250,000 !
oval.
With the Trojans expected to win j
the meet handily, interest will cen- I
ter on the much-publicized Wykoff- ;
Kiesel sprint duels. Like Hec Dyer, j
Kiesel makes his best showing in i
the longer race, while the situation j
is reversed with the Trojan flash. ;
Wykoff is expected to cop the cen- ;
tury, while Bear supporters look for !
their sophomore find to come j
through in the furlong.
In case you're interested, dedica- >
tory ceremonies will be held at 1:30 '
o'clock, with the meet slated to get i
under way about 15 minutes later. 1
IN SUPPORTING a plan
which would save prominent \
athletes from elimination from j
the Olympic Games because of j
an "off day" during the trials,
Dink Templeton probably had
in mind the case of Bud Spen
cer, the greatest middle-distance
man produced at Stanford before
this Eastman person came along.
After setting a new world's
400-meter record, which he still
holds. Spencer went to Boston
for the final Olympic tryouts.
An ''off day" or something kept
him from qualifying in that
event. lie went to Europe as a
member of the relay team,
proved himself the best one-lap
man of the lot, and yet wasn't
allowed to enter the 400-meter
event because of that windy af
ternoon at Boston. There is
nothing to assure that Ben East
man won't meet a similar fate.
Obviously something is haywire
with such a system.
STALLING IS on the spot at Chi
cago, where the National Associa
tion of Basketball Coaches is in ses
sion. Coach John Bunn is among
the most prominent of the many
seeking action against this obnoxious
style of play.
Eventually some action will be
taken against stalling, but it may not
come this year. Legislation has been
sought against it before, but without
success, largely because of the un
wieldiness of the coaching body.

thrilling sport under the sun.
If that's too far away, another
great polo match is on tap for
Beresford. Cecil Smith and
"Rube" Williams will again he
featured, playing with the Han
ger quartet against the Castro
Valley four. This afternoon Cas
tro Valley and Cypress Point 1
will clash in the finals of the j
open championship.
WITH STANFORD resting, track I
interest will swing to the California- j
Southern California meet at Berke- |
ley tomorrow afternoon, which will ;
dedicate California's new $250,000 !
oval.
With the Trojans expected to win j
the meet handily, interest will cen- I
ter on the much-publicized Wykoff- ;
Kiesel sprint duels. Like Hec Dyer, j
Kiesel makes his best showing in i
the longer race, while the situation j
is reversed with the Trojan flash. ;
Wykoff is expected to cop the cen- ;
tury, while Bear supporters look for !
their sophomore find to come j
through in the furlong.
In case you're interested, dedica- >
tory ceremonies will be held at 1:30 '
o'clock, with the meet slated to get i
under way about 15 minutes later. 1
IN SUPPORTING a plan
which would save prominent \
athletes from elimination from j
the Olympic Games because of j
an "off day" during the trials,
Dink Templeton probably had
in mind the case of Bud Spen
cer, the greatest middle-distance
man produced at Stanford before
this Eastman person came along.
After setting a new world's
400-meter record, which he still
holds. Spencer went to Boston
for the final Olympic tryouts.
An ''off day" or something kept
him from qualifying in that
event. lie went to Europe as a
member of the relay team,
proved himself the best one-lap
man of the lot, and yet wasn't
allowed to enter the 400-meter
event because of that windy af
ternoon at Boston. There is
nothing to assure that Ben East
man won't meet a similar fate.
Obviously something is haywire
with such a system.
STALLING IS on the spot at Chi
cago, where the National Associa
tion of Basketball Coaches is in ses
sion. Coach John Bunn is among
the most prominent of the many
seeking action against this obnoxious
style of play.
Eventually some action will be
taken against stalling, but it may not
come this year. Legislation has been
sought against it before, but without
success, largely because of the un
wieldiness of the coaching body.

ANYWAY, SAM EASTMAN
swears it's true. Ben's strawberry- |
topped brother decided to let his .
stop-watch run dqfcvn the other j
night, just a night or so after Ben's '
famous run. Sam placed the watch
on his bureau, put out the cat, said
his prayers, turned out the light,
and soon his melodious snore filled
the Alpha Delt house.
The next morning the watch had I
stopped. Where had it stopped? At j
4G.4 seconds!
