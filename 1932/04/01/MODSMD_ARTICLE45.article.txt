GAME TODAY
Stanford vs. U.S.C., on Varsity
diamond at 2:30 o'clock.
GAME TOMORROW
Stanford vs. California, in
Berkeley Stadium at 2:30 o'clock

Strengthened by a week of rest, j
after a more o rless mediocre South- J
ern invasion, Stanford's varsity base- :
bal lteam plays the first of three j
games scheduled for the next four j
days when it encounters el Trojan ;
on the Farm ball lot at 2:30 o'clock
today.
The Indians are at present just |
about where they were at the start j
of the season, having won and lost j
five games. However, should they |
win their next three contests they j
will be tied with S.C. and half a |
game ahead of the Golden Bears.
Decisive Contests
The three games arc: Southern j
California here today; California at j
Berkeley tomorrow; and University ,
of San Francisco here Monday,
j California, by virtue of an 8-4 j
j victory over the Trojans yesterday, j
is but half a game out of first place, j
ilf the Cardinals win today it will;
' put the Bears in the lead, if they
win tomorrow it will put S.C. back
J in the lead, and if they also win j
J Monday it will put therrv in a tie for
first place.
Southern California will start its
, star lefthander, George "Buck"
Buchanan, on the mound today. He
will be pitted against Ernie Caddel
i if the weather is warm, and against
Herm Estes if it is cold. Caddel, if
he is hot, has the stuff to turn back
j the league-leaders, and if Stanford
l can survive the Trojan attack, Coach
i Wolter will be able to start his most
' consistent winner, Stan Anderson,
| against California tomorrow.
Peterson to Start
The Bears defeated S.C. with
Saunders and Cooper doing the
| hurling yesterday, which means that
Coach Clint Evans will start his ace
i pitcher, Bill Peterson, against Stan
j ford tomorrow.
With "Lefty" Goldmann out of
! the line-up, via the faculty ax, Wol
ter will shift Gordy Campbell to
left field, and start Dick Miles in
right. The big sophomore is a good
fielder, and has looked good at the
plate in the few appearances he has
made this year. If he can stand the
competition, the line-up should be
materially the same. Wolter is also
trying Jim Kelly on first base.
A great deal of Stanford's chance
to repeat this year depends on the
performance of the Delmas-Philippi-
Kelly combination. If they play up
to last season's form Stanford will
repeat.

GAME TODAY
Stanford vs. U.S.C., on Varsity
diamond at 2:30 o'clock.
GAME TOMORROW
Stanford vs. California, in
Berkeley Stadium at 2:30 o'clock

Strengthened by a week of rest, j
after a more o rless mediocre South- J
ern invasion, Stanford's varsity base- :
bal lteam plays the first of three j
games scheduled for the next four j
days when it encounters el Trojan ;
on the Farm ball lot at 2:30 o'clock
today.
The Indians are at present just |
about where they were at the start j
of the season, having won and lost j
five games. However, should they |
win their next three contests they j
will be tied with S.C. and half a |
game ahead of the Golden Bears.
Decisive Contests
The three games arc: Southern j
California here today; California at j
Berkeley tomorrow; and University ,
of San Francisco here Monday,
j California, by virtue of an 8-4 j
j victory over the Trojans yesterday, j
is but half a game out of first place, j
ilf the Cardinals win today it will;
' put the Bears in the lead, if they
win tomorrow it will put S.C. back
J in the lead, and if they also win j
J Monday it will put therrv in a tie for
first place.
Southern California will start its
, star lefthander, George "Buck"
Buchanan, on the mound today. He
will be pitted against Ernie Caddel
i if the weather is warm, and against
Herm Estes if it is cold. Caddel, if
he is hot, has the stuff to turn back
j the league-leaders, and if Stanford
l can survive the Trojan attack, Coach
i Wolter will be able to start his most
' consistent winner, Stan Anderson,
| against California tomorrow.
Peterson to Start
The Bears defeated S.C. with
Saunders and Cooper doing the
| hurling yesterday, which means that
Coach Clint Evans will start his ace
i pitcher, Bill Peterson, against Stan
j ford tomorrow.
With "Lefty" Goldmann out of
! the line-up, via the faculty ax, Wol
ter will shift Gordy Campbell to
left field, and start Dick Miles in
right. The big sophomore is a good
fielder, and has looked good at the
plate in the few appearances he has
made this year. If he can stand the
competition, the line-up should be
materially the same. Wolter is also
trying Jim Kelly on first base.
A great deal of Stanford's chance
to repeat this year depends on the
performance of the Delmas-Philippi-
Kelly combination. If they play up
to last season's form Stanford will
repeat.
