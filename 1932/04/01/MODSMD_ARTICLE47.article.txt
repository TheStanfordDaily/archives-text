## Stanford Squad Opposes U.C.L.A. Outfit At 1 O'Clock On Varsity Courts; Leadership In Balance 
### WILLARD BUNGAY 
jOTANFORD'S varsity tennis team will face its tuoghest conference 1
I competition of the year when it mees the powerful U.C.L.A. netmen
on the varsity courts at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
Coach Bill Anderson brought the strongest team ever to play for the
, Bruins north with him. The Westwood team includes a trio of three
year veterans and three nationally known sophomores, Captain Elbert i
Lewis, Pacific Coast Intercollegiate singles champion in 1930; Leonard

■ Dworkin, California Intercollegiate
■ singles champion in 1930; and Cliff i
Bobbins, seventh ranking national I
intercollegiate player in 1930, are j
the veterans upon whom Ackerman '
lays his hopes of victory.
Trio of Aces
His three promising sophomores j
| are Jack Tidball, Bruin No. 1 man j
I and twentieth national ranking!
singles player; Billy Doeg, brother 1
of the famous John Doeg, former'
! Stanford star and national singles
! champion in 1930, who is fourth I
| ranking junior singles player; and !
| Spud Myers, a high ranking nation- j
I al junior doubles player.
With such an array of stars, 1
: U.C.L.A. is slightly favored to win !
the meet, although it is expected to
: be the closest and hardest-fought!
s battle to date. However, the Indian j
i team has been pointing for this
match and is ready to put up the
stiffest battle of the season.
Lead at Stake
Today's meet will give the winner j
j a distinct lead for the conference!
I championship, as Stanford has de- ;
feated Southern California, who i
previously won from California. The I
I losers' only hope will be a return j
match to be played in Los Angeles, j
Although no definite lineup has;
i been announced by either coach,'
the teams will probably play as
follows: Singles—Gledhill (S) vs. .
Tidball; Coughlin (S) vs. Lewisj
Forbes (S) vs. Robbins; Otis (S) !
vs. Doeg; Cosgrove (S) vs. Dworkin;
Weesner (S) vs. .Myers.
