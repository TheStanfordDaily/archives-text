## Strength In Field Events Gives Alameda Stars Edge Over Indians 
### 
The Little Big Meet enigma is due
I for a first unravelling tomorrow
morning, when bay region fans have
! their first opportunity to compare
1 Stanford and California freshman
i track teams. The Indians meet the
j Alameda All-Stars at 10:30 on the
1 Old Oval, while the Bear Cubs are
j entertaining the same San Francisco
J All-Star team that defeated the
j Stanford freshmen in their first
| meet of the year.
Blackman Favorite
Al Blackman is one of the few
' certain winners in tomorrow's meet, j
' and should make Dami, Little, j
| Thompson, and Loane of the All- ;
1 Stars bite his dust. Todd and Peters |
I will be battling to earn place points
for Stanford. Ward Vincent and j
: Pierre Zucco of Stanford and Stal- |
j lard of Piedmont will tangle in the |
440, with Bob Brown, Indian miler, i
! a possible entry.
Alt and Lewis of the transbay |
1 squad are favored in the 880, but ,
they will have to run close to rec- .
i ord time to defeat Walt Harris and
j George Downing of Stanford. War- ,
I ren Lemmon, who made his first ap
i pearance on the Stanford track yes- j
terday, and Underhill, Deane, and ]
; Girvin are other Stanford possibili
[ ties. A Stanford landslide is expected
!in the mile, with Phil Morentin,
; Dave Devlin, and Bob Brown out
: to take all three places.
Bowles in Iligh Hurdles
Dubsor of University High and
Frankie Bowles of Stanford meet
in the high hurdles, while Smithson
j and Wilkes of the All-Stars face
\ Russ Munro, Robert Buffum, Aylett
j Cotton, and Andy Bright of the
j freshmen in the low hurdles.
Stanford is weak in the field
j events. Lloyd Schween should win
j a high jump victory for the Indians,
j with Raymond, an understudy of
: the great Vernon Ball, Seamon,
j Dami, of the All-Stars, and Johnston
: of Stanford jumping for second and
third. Alameda broad-jumpers are
| likely to take nine points in this
< event unless Peters, Bowles,, Flip
, pen, Kelly, and Reynolds can muster
some hundred feet of broad-jump
ing between them.
