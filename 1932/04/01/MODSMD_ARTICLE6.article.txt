# BIG BEN'S TIME IS RE-CLOCKED ON MIDNIGHT WATCH
## 
### 
There are those things which
we call coincidences and then
there are occurrences which
which we call real coincidences.
This is one of the latter classi
fication.
Sam Eastman, brother of
Ben, owns a stop-watch. He
gives the instrument good care.
The other evening he wound it
up and let it run during the
night to rest the spring. In the
morning he looked at it. Forty
six and four-tenths seconds it
read â€”the time in which his
thin, blond brother had raced
around Stanford's oval to break
the world's 440-yard record
last Saturday afternoon.
