## Wykoff Runs Century Only As S.C. Triumphs, 102 1-3 To 28 2-3 FOUR INDIANS PLEASED Butler, Werder, Amdahl, Ray All Cheered 
### Dick Strouse 
The University of California, to
the merry tunes of "California,
California," and a 102 1-3 to 28 2-3
defeat by U.S.C.'s powerful Trojans,
dedicated her new Edwards track
last Saturday afternoon before 7000
or more amateur track fans and the
Stanford cinder squad. The poor
paying public was interested in the
dedication ceremony, while the
Card spikemen, who also paid their
dollar apiece to gain admission, fo
cused their attention on the per
formances of the individual mem
bers of Dean Cromwell's team.
WykofT Out of 220
When the meet was over and
Californians were making exceed
ingly uncomplimentary remarks
about Frank WykoiT's withdrawal
from the 220, Oilie Amdahl, Bill
Werder, Wally Butler, and A1 Ray,
of the Indians, could be seen smil
ing happily to themselves. At the
same time, John Lyman, Nellie
Gray, and Gus Meier left the field
scowling and muttering strange
words.
The Cards who found the meet
decidedly to their liking obtained
their satisfaction from the mediocre
performances of the Trojans in three
events. Amdahl, the Stanford sopho
more who has already established
himself as one of the coast's best
two-milers, couldn't help applauding
Callahan of the Trojans when he
finished the eight-lap chase for
fame in 10 minutes and 2.2 seconds.
Times Cheering
Amdahl has run 9:49.2 himself
this year, and one doesn't have to
lake calculus to figure that Amdahl's
time is faster than Callahan's. But
since the new California oval was
slow, and since Callahan was not
pushed, his time cannot be tai' >n
too seriously.
The inability of Troy's broad
jumpers to get their bodies beyond
the 23-foot mark proved good news
to Werder and Butler, who consti
tute the Stanford strength in this
event. Dick Barber, the I.C. 4-A.
champion, did not compete, but
nevertheless Saturday's showing did
not verify U.S.C.'s boast of five 2.3-
foot broad-jumpers.
Ray Relieved
Ray, who had heard tales of
sophomore Williamson's proficiency
at throwing spears and who knew
from sad experience of McKenzie's
ability, couldn't control a sigh of re
lief when he saw Williamson's best
throw stop at 192 feet 7 inches. Mc-
Kenzie, who won the javelin in last
year's Stanford-U.S.C. meet, was
five feet behind his teammate.
Lyman and Gray, the two men
who are supposed to get first and
second in the shot-put if Stanford
is to have any chance at all against
Southern California, were far from
pleased with a heave of 49 feet %
inch made by a little-known Trojan
named Harper. It is true that tall
Hall, the 1.C.4-A. shot-put cham
pion, couldn't get the metal sphere
much beyond the 4fi-foot mark, but
Hall is always slow in getting into
shape.
Just as Gils Meier had improved
enough to be given an even chance
with all the hurdlers left over from
Cromwell's 1981 team, he learned
that Jeddy Welsh and Jimmie
Paine had returned to school.
