## 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
"Will there .... or will there
not .... be a Masque Ball this
spring?" Which is merely the ques
tion troubling a worried campus
loday, following close on hte heels
of several disturbing rumors ema
nating from Rally Committee head
quarters in Room 225 Toyon yester
day afternoon.
Charges â€¢ hurled at Edgar Amos
Boyles to the effect that his group
was sponsoring the affair this year
merely in order that he, Edgar,
could escort a certain young lady
to the Pavilion that evening as his
queen were in part confirmed when
it was learned through various
sources that the said member of the
"600" IS going t<> attend the Ball,
but with another escort!!
Immediately the report came out
that Boyles, wilting away in the se
clusion of his quarters, as a final
gesture today would announce that
the event is to be called off. Late
last evening, however, although re
fusing to make a definite statement,
Erl admitted that he is "not so keen
. bout the idea, now thai Marion is

! going with some other fellow
j Miss Barbara Beach Thompson,
; Kappa's gift to the A.W.S., issued
{ the following declaration in the hope
i that the Ball will be held as sched
uled on April 15.
j "We wemen welcome the coming
I contest as an opportunity to let the
j world know our mettle. I have
I every confidence that the feminine
i members of Stanford's famed upper
! 15 per cent are on the eve of a great
triumph. Stanford women, take up
j ypur gauntlet!"
Boyles, five minutes later, added:
M'Mills, California, Pomona . . . .
take up your gauntlet!"
The final declaration of the eve
ning (the last straw) originated with
Mini (Ha-IIa!!) Strout, who in a
I private conversation with our man
j Boyles declared, "1 think it is going
over simply keen with the younger
j girls However, the older
girls and my own intimates have
I gone beyond taking an interest in
j such collegiate things." Just then
; the Camel's Back was broken into
I bits.
