### 
Most Stanford students are honorable and neither give nor receive
unpermitted aid in academic work. However, because of their very
honesty they Sometimes conduct themselves carelessly and unwittingly
lay themselves open to suspicion. Therefore the following recom
mendations are made:
1. During examinations:
a) Take alternate seats wherever possible and lay any
hooks you may have with you on the empty seat be
side you. DO NOT KEEP THEM ON YOUR LAP.
If the classroom is crowded and there is no empty
chair beside you on which you may place your books,
lay them on the floor under your own chair.
b) Leave no written material which you may have with
you exposed. Put it inside your binder or inside a
hook.
c) Do not sit with your friends.
d) Do not read letters during an examination.
e) Use extra bluebooks for scratch paper.
f) If you wish to re-write your examination paper do it
openly and save the original bluebook.
g) Do not carry dope sheets from which you have been
studying to class with you.
Example: The case is brought to mind of the
student who had his dope sheet on little slips of
paper v/hich he took to the examination with him
in the pocket of his lumber jacket. During the
ex he pulled out his handkerchief and accident
ally pulled out with it the slips of paper which
scattered all over the floor and he had to pick up.
Anyone who wished to suspect him of premedi
tated cheating would have been justified in do
ing so.
e) Do not carry on extended conversations during an
examination. It not only arouses suspicion but an
noys other students. If you must speak to someone
do it frankly and briefly.
2. Term Papers:
Give full credit to your sources by means of foot
notes and bibliographies.
