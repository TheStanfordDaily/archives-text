one sectional meet, provided he |
! reaches a certain standard,' a change j
in regulations was announced by the
track and field committee yesterday, i

' munity in the country may conduct
j a preliminary tryout, upon making

l passing an arbitrary standard auto- J

I rule was to relieve the athlete or

| tryouts are scheduled, the new rule
makes it unnecessary for competi
j tors to qualify through these meets j
' alone.
