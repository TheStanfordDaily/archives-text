# AXE CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY OF RECOVERY TODAY
## 
### 
''The Stanford Axe is Stan
ford's own once more!" These
few words, gleaned from the
April 4, 1930, issue of the
Stanford Daily state as simply
as possible the event which a
beaming Farm celebrated in the
midst of spring yesterday, the
second anniversary of the re
covery ol the famed instru
ment.
"California still 'hates Stan
ford like hell,'" says the
Daily a few days later, after
Stanford officials had frowned
on the idea of removing the
Axe from its vault and putting
it up as a Big Game trophy
every year.
"Hate Stanford!" wailed the
Daily Californian last fall. The
Axe was still in the vault. And
today, at the present writing,
it is still there, safe and sound,
as Stanford marches proudly
into its third year as possessor
of the wandering blade.
