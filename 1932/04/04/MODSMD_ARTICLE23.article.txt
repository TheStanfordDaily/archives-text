### GAME TODAY

By Bol> Wade
Inability to hit or'field in the
pinches cost Stanford any slim
chance that remained for another
baseball pennant this year when the
varsity dropped a 4-3 decision to the
invading U.S.C. outfit Friday.
Southern California scored a pair
in the fourth on three hits to break
the ice. Stanford came back in the
home half of the inning with one
marker on two blows. For the first
three innings neither team had been
able to score and Stanford had gar
nered the only hit.
Trautman Doubles
That was all the scoring until the
last half of the seventh, when
Trautman doubled to score Camp
bell and Philippi. Incidentally this
was the only extra-base blow of the
day.
Anderson was pitching good ball,
and with the one-run lead, looked
like a winner.
Arbelbide was the first man up in
the ninth, and Anderson struck him
out in a hurry. But Mohler walked.
Roth well singled, Youel was safe
on Tiiplett's error, and Mohler and
Rothwell scored when Bankston got
his one single of the day.
Buchanan took care of the Red
shirts in short order in the home
half of the ninth.
California Wins
Memories of last year's champion
ship aggregation faded into the dis
card Saturday when the Stanford
Indians went down to a crushing 8-1
defeat before the fine pitching of
California's ace, Bill Peterson. The
Bear hurler struck out nine Red
skins and made the game look like
an exhibition contest.
Once more Stanford bobbled the
ball when errors meant runs for the
opponents. But the Bears had the
range of their right field fence,
which makes the right fielder look
as if he were playing right short
stop, and they pounded Estes and
Caddel for 18 hits and 8 runs.
Stanford Gets One Run
Stanford's lone marker came in
the ninth, when Campbell doubled,
Philippi walked, and Goodell singled
to score Campbell.
The Indians gathered a total of
five hits and as many walks, but.
they failed to look impressive at any
time, and never were a threat to the
smooth-working Bear machine. The
defeat blasted any chance of a Stan
ford victory in. the pennant race.

Trautman Doubles
That was all the scoring until the
last half of the seventh, when
Trautman doubled to score Camp
bell and Philippi. Incidentally this
was the only extra-base blow of the
day.
Anderson was pitching good ball,
and with the one-run lead, looked
like a winner.
Arbelbide was the first man up in
the ninth, and Anderson struck him
out in a hurry. But Mohler walked.
Roth well singled, Youel was safe
on Tiiplett's error, and Mohler and
Rothwell scored when Bankston got
his one single of the day.
Buchanan took care of the Red
shirts in short order in the home
half of the ninth.
California Wins
Memories of last year's champion
ship aggregation faded into the dis
card Saturday when the Stanford
Indians went down to a crushing 8-1
defeat before the fine pitching of
California's ace, Bill Peterson. The
Bear hurler struck out nine Red
skins and made the game look like
an exhibition contest.
Once more Stanford bobbled the
ball when errors meant runs for the
opponents. But the Bears had the
range of their right field fence,
which makes the right fielder look
as if he were playing right short
stop, and they pounded Estes and
Caddel for 18 hits and 8 runs.
Stanford Gets One Run
Stanford's lone marker came in
the ninth, when Campbell doubled,
Philippi walked, and Goodell singled
to score Campbell.
The Indians gathered a total of
five hits and as many walks, but.
they failed to look impressive at any
time, and never were a threat to the
smooth-working Bear machine. The
defeat blasted any chance of a Stan
ford victory in. the pennant race.
