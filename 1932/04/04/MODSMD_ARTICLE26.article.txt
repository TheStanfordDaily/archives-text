# FOUR-YEAR STATIC COLLEGES AGITATION

### 
Persistent political agitation for Ihe conversion of sev
eral California junior colleges into l'our-vear, state-oper- j
a ted institutions is meeting with determined resistance:
from Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, president of the I'niver-1
sily of California. Xeccssarih restrained by 11 is position
as head of the slate university whose interests are directly
threatened by the proposals, Dr. Sproul is nevertheless
making a courageous stand, one which should have the in
dorsement of everyone interested in maintaining the state's
high standard of education.
In recent speeches on the subject the t'.S. chief has j
pointed out the obvious, and practically conclusive, objec
tions to the establishment of more full-time colleges. Of
most immediate appeal in these times of reduced govern
mental revenues and higher taxes is the reminder that
even so rich a state as California cannot go on indefinitely
spending money on its educational system. With three |
separate I'nivcrsity of California establishments, (at Herke-1
lev, Los Angeles, and Davis) and a number of teachers'!
colleges already drawing directly from the Sacramento
treasury, it is apparent that any new institutions would
prove a severe drain upon the state's resources.
An attempt to avoid an increase in expenditures by!
cutting down on the existing establishments would be very
detrimental from an educational standpoint. Half a dozen,
small colleges scattered about the state could not offer
facilities equal to those of a large, centralized university.
The enormous costs of duplication would make it impos
sible to provide as wide a range of instruction in each of a
group of small colleges as is now available in the university.
t'p in Oregon the wisdom of Dr. Sproul's views is being
exemplified by the plan of educational directors to reduce
unnecessary duplication at Oregon State and Oregon I'ni
vcrsity. Instead of dividing up colleges, Oregon is consoli
dating its existing institutions. The attention of local
political leaders might well be directed northward.
