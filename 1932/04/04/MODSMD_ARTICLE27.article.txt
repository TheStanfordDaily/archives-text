# MILLS SPEAKS

### 
I'nder the caption "C.an't We He Friends" the Mills
\\ ekly published the following editorial. Although pro
testing against cattiness, the article contains a few remarks
exhibiting that quality, which is apparently an integral part
of the feminine makeup. Don't be mislead by the heading;
it covers a malicious heart.
"The Stanford 'Five Hundred' were all excited when
tile 'roughs' considered Mills women (and Mills women
only) as suitable to preside over the Masqued Hall as the
Stanford co-eds. So, realizing they might have been more
tactful in discussing the possibility of importing a queen
for the Hall, the 'roughs' have discarded their roughness
long enough to omit the bans and enlarge the group to
include any fair damsel the evening's regent may choose to
enlist.
"However, the fact that Mills women have entertained
Stanford men as well as having been entertained by them
is reason enough for Mills eligibility to the honor. (Our
modesty prevents ns from listing any further reasons.)
"We are surprised at the 'Five Hundred' for getting so
wrought up over the affair. C.onld it be that they're a wee
bit jealous? Certainly no one intended they should be.
Mills feels no such enmity toward Stanford women as is
shown in the Siamomd Daily toward us. Can't we be
friends ?
"If there's going to be any catting at this party the
Stanford women may indulge in it to their hearts' delight
we simply can't be bothered (which may be one of the
reasons for our popularity).
"And as for being compared to students of other educa
tional institutions that, ton, we can ignore. Idle gossip
only breeds dissension where il exists, and if we can't chat
pleasantly we will not chat at all.
"So Mills awaits with interest the regent's choice. He
she picked from the great wide world, from Mills, or from
Stanford, mav the fairest win!"
