# BULL SESSION
## CORDS IN DISREPUTE 
### 
You can sit in the Memorial
! Church with dirty cords; you can
| sit on the Stanford Mausoleum with
! dirty cords; dirty cords do not bar
! you from feeling comfortable in
i Dean Yost's office—in Dean Culver's
! office or even in the President's of
i fice. But, there is one place on this
j campus where dirty cords exclude
| you and that place is the Felton
i Library—the red seats in the Felton
| room.
Few know the place, for with the
icy atmosphere that hangs over the
; room, one feels as welcome as a
. blow-torch in a Frigidaire. To be
i brief, the Felton Library is a fancy
! room on the third floor of the main
! library, with many fancy editions
! scattered about it. The idea or theo
; retical principle behind it all is that,
j students will browse a bit, pick a
| book, sit down, and read it.
i
! Knowing this to be the theory, I
V determined to test it, having heard
j many rumors that the theory did
: not operate for those wearing cor-
I duroy trousers —vulgarly termed,
j "cords." After winding my way
I along the maze of hallways and by
-1 ways found above the main floor of
I the library, I found the place. My
I feeling must have been very similar
i to the ginuea pig that runs for
1 psychology's sake—and if fortunate,
| just before exhaustion takes hold,
emerges into his feeding box. Here
I was (in the Felton Library—not a
\ feeding box). I finally selected a
; book and prepared to sit down in
[ one of the inviting red plush seats.
The librarian informed me that
! the hard wooden chairs would bear
I my weary frame. With a little ques-
I tioning I discovered that not all

j cords are barred but only those
J considered "dirty" by the person in
I charge.
I Now, one does not mind—as such
| —sitting on the hard chairs. For,
| after all, one's soul is transported
j to the realms of the higher literary
! masters; one could sit on red-hot
| spikes and never notice the ineon-
I venience. But I did not wish to sit
|on spikes, I desired to sit on the
■ soft seals. I have since made my
j experiment scientific in the best
: manner by sending a goodly num
| ber of corded friends to the room.
| Some sit as they wish; some must
j sit where they are told.
I tried to reason with the li
' brarian by telling her that dark
J woolens could contain as much dirt
las soiled cords. My reason failed.
I The experiment was completed,
[ however, by returning to the place
|in trousers that have been worn
| longer since cleaning than the re-
I jected cords. I sat where I pleased.
S Such prejudice against the almost
! universal dress on this campus is
j most annoying, and represents a
i type of starched collar prudery
| without legitimate place in this Uni
i versity.
I
No one would desire to go in this
or any library room dripping with
J mud or covered with oil. The fact
' that we were allowed to stay at all
i proves this was not the case. Faded
! cords show every spot; ours showed
j plenty of spots. They were not fit
! to appear at a formal reception be
-1 fore King George. The Felton room
is beautiful and new. Why not seal
lup the place entirely? Remember
| even air destroys.
