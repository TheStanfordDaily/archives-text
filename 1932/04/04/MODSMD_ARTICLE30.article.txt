Everybody is running for the

j a candidate too! The other candi
dates can run, but I think I can win
!at a slow trot—or maybe even a
walk. The King has nothing to do
, and consequently we are most gifted
I by nature in carrying out the duties
|of this office. Furthermore we

interesting and original ways ima

The first thing a King has to
do is choose a queen, because a
| single king may fall on the ace
while a king with a queen is
always good for one trick. Fur
thermore, thrones usually come
built for two and it is a waste
of throne space to have only
one person sitting on it.

Now in choosing a queen, the
1 King meets his greatest difficulties.
I If I pick a Kappa—the Pi Phis will
! go mad with envy. Choosing a Theta

j ing their hair. And if I make a
I Roble maiden queen. Sorority Row
j will worry itself thinner over the
validity of that much-disputed saw,
I "All that glitters goes 'row.' "
There is only one way to
remedy this situation and
Doakes is the King to do it.
Who said that the King of the
! Masque Ball has to be mono
genous (single queened)? I pro
pose to create a Royal Ilarem
| for that one affair. In it will go
one representative of every
sorority, half a dozen from
Rohle, and any other co-ed who
will buy her own bid. If it is
i ' necessary to import a queen,
Doakes can do that too —imports
will, of course, furnish their
own transportation.

i ine regal taste is shown by having
; court jesters. We will .bring .the

city. They won't have to act. What
a scream they will be! They might
even have a trial or two —issue a
half dozen statements or so—in case
the evening becomes quite dull.
