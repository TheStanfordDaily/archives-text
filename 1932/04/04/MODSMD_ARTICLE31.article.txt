Coach Pop Warner will resume
' his work in building up the 1932
j football team this afternoon as the
i second week of practice gets under
way.
Although suits were issued to 97
| men, the turnouts have not yet
j reached that number. With the close
|of the baseball season in a few
weeks, several lettermen from last
; year's squad should be on hand, as
: well as some of last year's freshman
j numeral winners and members of
| the squad.
; Ernie Caddel, Si an Anderson, and
Gordy Campbell from Harry Wol
ter's ball team should make the
backfield situation a little more
rosy. Anderson, it is predicted, will
develop into one of the greatest
kickers in Stanford history. A mem
ber of the squad last year, he did
not compete in any games, and is
therefore eligible for three more
years of college play.
j At Friday's practice Coach War
ner introduced three new plays. He
: spent most of the time, however,
i drilling the men in the simple fun
damentals which are so necessary
