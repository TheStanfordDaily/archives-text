STRANGERS IN LOVE—At the ' I
Stanford Theatre.
Fredric March and a clever yarn j fj
make this one of the most entertain- j j|
ing pictures of the season. March j &
plays (he dual role of twin brothers, g
one the staunch, straight-backed ; I
type that is at heart a vile villain, J1
and the other a Quixotic sort. The ; g
deception is well done. It's a little ; I
hard to figure out how these clever | |
movie people can show a person j |
picking himself up by tugging on i |
his coat collar.
Kay Francis takes the leading ! 1
feminine role. She injects a little j |
more punch than usual this time I |
into her characterization, and makes j |
a good co-star for the fiery Fredric | |
March. Stuart Erwin helps a lot to- i |
ward keeping the comedy running j |
at high speed. —B.M. 1 |
A CHURCH MOUSE—At the Al
cazar Theatre, San Francisco
Colleen Moore makes a better |
showing on the legitimate stage than
she ever made on the silver screen i
and "A Church Mouse" must have
been written for her. The theme is i
on the time-honored Cinderella |
type dished up in modern fashion. |
The title indicates something rather !
sweet and unsophisticated made ]
especially for children of seven
years and less, but fortunately the
lines belie the indication, being
j sprightly and usually even sophis
i ticated.
1 Jameson Thomas, as the Viennese
I banker and baron, carries off the
\ part of an efficient rake with con-
J vincing ability, and Colleen as the j
| poor little girl who captures a job j
j with him as his secretary on her i
j ability; and captures his heart with |
| her charms in the last act, manages i
to be convincing in both styles.
Sheer acting honors, however, go !
to Russell Fillmore, as Jackson, the i
I banker's efficient assistant, with his j
i celluloid cuffs, compendiums of the ;
banking business. He makes almostj
as good a drunk as Leon Eroll, than
which no praise can be higher.
This is not the sort of thing that !
I will keep you awake at night think
j ing out the problems of life, but it is j
! very good light entertainment, for
; man, woman, or child. —S.CA. j
