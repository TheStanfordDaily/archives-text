# BABE TRACKSTERS DROP 63-59 MEET TO ALAMEDA IN
## All-Star Aggregation Noses Out Yearlings; Third Loss Of Season 
### 
The Gods of chance brought the
Stanford and California freshman
track teams together Saturday morn
ing when both teams figured in 63-
59 track meets.
With strong winds and wet tracks
preventing any outstanding perform
ances, the Indians dropped a 03-59
decision to the Alameda All-Stars,
while the California Bear Cubs were
defeating the San Francisco All-
Stars by an identical score. Several
junior college stars, including Chase,
Beitoli, Jacques, and Ball, competed
for Alameda, and ihe thirteen points
scored by these men were more than
enough to win the meet for the
pseudo-prep school aggregation.
Third Defeat
Although his team lost its third
meet in succession, Bill Ellington
was more than satisfied with the per
formance of the freshman squad. A
new high hurdler, Jim Savage, won
the 120-yard race in his first, attempt
of the season, while Aylett Cotton
and Robert Buffum showed real im
provement in the lows by taking first
and third, respectively.
Vincent and Zucco took first and
second in the 440 without any
trouble, and Morentin and Downing
looked good in taking second and
third in the 830.
Three totally unexpected develop
ments occurred in the field events.
Kelly ran down a rain soaked run
way to leap 20 feet, 7 inches in the
broad jump, Lory Rothert showed
the first signs of returning to his
high school form by pole-vaulting 11
feet, G inches, and Johnny Mottram
threw the javelin over 150 feet to
take third, behind Lutz of Alameda
and Bcatty of Stanford.
Two of the best young jumpers in
the bay region, Vernon Bali, of Ber
keley, and Lloyd Schween, of Stan
ford, took third and fifth in the high
jump. Ball managed to clear 5 feet,
2 inches, but Schween was hardly
able to get off the muddy ground at
all.
