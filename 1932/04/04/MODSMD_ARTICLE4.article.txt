# 'FAUST' DRAMA WELL RECEIVED
## Large, Sympathetic Crowd Attends Production 
### 
Distinctly of worth as a contribu
tion to the memory of Johann Wolf
gang von Goethe was the interpre
tation of his "Urfaust," presented
Friday evening in the Assembly
Hall, by the Department of Ger
manic Languages, before a sympa
thetic audience of nearly one thou
sand persons. The audience, re
quested in the program to refrain
from applause, saw fit to clap en
thusiastically after several scenes
and to call for encores.
Dr. Kurt Reinhardt displayed a
deep understanding in his polished
portrayal of the rather immature
Faust of the '"Urfaust." In his
lengthy monologue of the first scene
he was at his best. His love scenes,
however, were awkward and incon
gruous.
Peter Vellenga, perfectly cast as
Mephistopheles, gave a forceful and
realistic performance. He was till
that one would expect the devil to
be, although occasionally his lines
were poorly enunciated.
Altogether adequate support was
given to Dr. Reinhardt by Dorothy
Ulrici, who played the difficult role
of the tragic Margaret. She was
ethereally beautiful in the cathedral
and prison scenes.
A measure of comedy was added to
the production by Donald Morgan,
who played the part of the timid and
stupid Student. Other members of
the cast who gave good perform
ances were Artha Gordon, Karl
Falk, Joseph Ponti, and Robert
Clark.
Admirably suited to the nature of
the production were the settings, im
pressionistic and depending strongly
upon lighting effects, which were
designed and executed by Gerrit de
Jong. Most striking were the sets
for Faust's study and the cathedral
scene.
"Urfaust" will be presented in San
Francisco on April 22 before the San
Francisco German Club.
