That Keith Gledhill will not
play in Stanford's next three
tennis matches was revealed
yesterday when he announced
that he will leave Wednesday
to take part in the Mid-Pacific
championship tournament at
Honolulu next week. He will
miss the Pomona meet and the
return matches with U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A., but will probably re
turn in time for the first Cali
fornia tilt.
