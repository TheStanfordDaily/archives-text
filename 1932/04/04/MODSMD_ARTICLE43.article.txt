NEVER AGAIN will Caddy Works
read the evening paper at a basket
ball game.
Never again will a Capps and
Bescos combination retire to the
back court and play dominos while
an apoplectic crowd showers the
floor with pennies.
No, them, days is gone forever.
Alter fruitlessly seeking action for
several years, the opponents of the
stalling or "guard control" type of
play secured drastic legislation
against this obnoxious system at the
annual meeting of the National As
sociation of Basketball Coaches in
Chicago last week.
Pronounced by "Phog" Allen as
the most drastic and most beneficial
change in the game since the intro
duction of the dribble in 1906, the
new rule requires that any team in
possession of the ball in the back
court must cross the center of the
playing floor toward its own target
within 10 seconds, according to As
social ed Press dispatches.
THE PENALTY for violation
of the new rule is loss of the
hall out of bounds. The rule,
which was suggested by Coach
Harold Olson of Ohio State, must
yet be approved by the rules
committee, but this is little more
than a matter of form.
Like the football rules com
mittee, the basketball associa
tion may have gone a little far.
Coach John Bunn's proposed
rule would have made allow
ance for legitimate stalling in
the closing five minutes of the
game, a feature of the present
game which adds, rather than
detracts from the action. How
ever, the new rule guarantees
a fast, thrilling game—the kind
that John ($. Public will pay his
money to see—and that's the
important thing.
ANOTHER RULE CHANGE of
considerable importance was an
nounced over (he week-end- Ibis

! one in football. The grid rules body 1
| decided by mail vote to reduce the j
' penalty for violation of the new rule |
| concerning illegal use of the hands |
; to 15 yards. The penalty originally
■ announced was disqualification.
I Pop Warner is enthusiastic over j
| this modification, which he believes j
I will make the rule workable. "Of- |
1 ficials should not now hesitate to I
j enforce this rule," Warner said last i
j night, "while they might have been |
1 slow to disqualify players for in- I
| fractions which were not too fla- i
j grant.
'"There is already a rule in the j
\ book concerning use of the hands j
i which is construed as slugging, with !
I disqualification as the penalty."
i Now if only the committee would '
' make some modification of the rule '
| which declares that the ball-carrier
i is down when any part of his body,
I other than hands or feet, touches j
; the ground, whether or not he is in j
; the grasp of an opponent. According j
! to this rule, if a player should catch ,
; a pass, for instance, and stumble, he j
j would be down even if an opponent
wasn't within 10 yards of him.
DEAN CROMWELL, U.S.C.

track coach, took a terrible
chance Saturday. In spite of the
fact that he was certain to win
his meet with California by an
overwhelming score, regardless
of any one event, like the 100-
yard dash, he entered Frankic
Wykofr in this sprint.
But the cash customers had
come from far and near to sec
the Wykoff-Kicsel duel, and
Dean Cromwell wouldn't think
of disappointing the cash cus
tomers. So, in spite of the fact
that his star sprinter had a
broken foot, a sore hip, a sore
back, and a boil on his face, the
good Dean entered Frankie in
the century.
Despite (hose terrible injuries,
Frankie won the event. But of
course it would have beeh too
much to ask him to run the 220
also. That would have been tak
ing TOO much of a chance, even
for the Dean. Especially since
the furlong is Keisel's best event.

DEAN CROMWELL, U.S.C.

track coach, took a terrible
chance Saturday. In spite of the
fact that he was certain to win
his meet with California by an
overwhelming score, regardless
of any one event, like the 100-
yard dash, he entered Frankic
Wykofr in this sprint.
But the cash customers had
come from far and near to sec
the Wykoff-Kicsel duel, and
Dean Cromwell wouldn't think
of disappointing the cash cus
tomers. So, in spite of the fact
that his star sprinter had a
broken foot, a sore hip, a sore
back, and a boil on his face, the
good Dean entered Frankie in
the century.
Despite (hose terrible injuries,
Frankie won the event. But of
course it would have beeh too
much to ask him to run the 220
also. That would have been tak
ing TOO much of a chance, even
for the Dean. Especially since
the furlong is Keisel's best event.

NEVER AGAIN will Caddy Works
read the evening paper at a basket
ball game.
Never again will a Capps and
Bescos combination retire to the
back court and play dominos while
an apoplectic crowd showers the
floor with pennies.
No, them, days is gone forever.
Alter fruitlessly seeking action for
several years, the opponents of the
stalling or "guard control" type of
play secured drastic legislation
against this obnoxious system at the
annual meeting of the National As
sociation of Basketball Coaches in
Chicago last week.
Pronounced by "Phog" Allen as
the most drastic and most beneficial
change in the game since the intro
duction of the dribble in 1906, the
new rule requires that any team in
possession of the ball in the back
court must cross the center of the
playing floor toward its own target
within 10 seconds, according to As
social ed Press dispatches.
THE PENALTY for violation
of the new rule is loss of the
hall out of bounds. The rule,
which was suggested by Coach
Harold Olson of Ohio State, must
yet be approved by the rules
committee, but this is little more
than a matter of form.
Like the football rules com
mittee, the basketball associa
tion may have gone a little far.
Coach John Bunn's proposed
rule would have made allow
ance for legitimate stalling in
the closing five minutes of the
game, a feature of the present
game which adds, rather than
detracts from the action. How
ever, the new rule guarantees
a fast, thrilling game—the kind
that John ($. Public will pay his
money to see—and that's the
important thing.
ANOTHER RULE CHANGE of
considerable importance was an
nounced over (he week-end- Ibis

! one in football. The grid rules body 1
| decided by mail vote to reduce the j
' penalty for violation of the new rule |
| concerning illegal use of the hands |
; to 15 yards. The penalty originally
■ announced was disqualification.
I Pop Warner is enthusiastic over j
| this modification, which he believes j
I will make the rule workable. "Of- |
1 ficials should not now hesitate to I
j enforce this rule," Warner said last i
j night, "while they might have been |
1 slow to disqualify players for in- I
| fractions which were not too fla- i
j grant.
'"There is already a rule in the j
\ book concerning use of the hands j
i which is construed as slugging, with !
I disqualification as the penalty."
i Now if only the committee would '
' make some modification of the rule '
| which declares that the ball-carrier
i is down when any part of his body,
I other than hands or feet, touches j
; the ground, whether or not he is in j
; the grasp of an opponent. According j
! to this rule, if a player should catch ,

j would be down even if an opponent
