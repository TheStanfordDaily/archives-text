## Captain Len Pock man, Tom Pockman, And Pearman Handle Bouts 
### 
Keeping their team ledger free
from debits, Stanford's fencers
copped the Bay Division team epee
championship over the week-end in
one of the strangest series of bouts
ever recorded. Although the Indians
won the team title, they failed to
i place a man in the individual meet
! that was held at the same time,
i Th<? Card trio, including Captain
I Leonard Pockman, Fred Pearman,
j and Tom Pockman, won five bouts
j and lost three on Friday night to
! defeat the Olympic Club, California,
and an independent team composed
J of California graduates. This victory
j gives Coach Harry Maloney's men a
' clean sweep of all the A.F.L.A. team
j meets held in this region.
The individual finals, which were
; held yesterday afternoon, found Al
! Fred Snyder and Jim Reed repre
j senting Stanford, all the members
; of the regular Card epee team hav
| ing failed to qualify. Snyder was
| fourth in the final ratings.
I Thompson, of the Olympic Club,
| won the individual title, with team
j mates Stanton and Martuess second
I and third. Martuess and Snyder won
| and lost the same number of bouts,
but the Clubman has fewer touches
: scored against him.
