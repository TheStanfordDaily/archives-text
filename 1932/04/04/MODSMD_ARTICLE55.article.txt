# FORMER VICTORS IN JOFFRE DEBATE AID CARDINAL HOPEFULS
## 
### 
In training the debate team, con
; sisting of Mary Katherine Morris,
Leonard Bloom, and Isador Botasof,
which will meet the University of
California in the Jollre Medal Debate
i at Berkeley on April 12th, Leland
1 Chapin, men's debate coach, has had
the assistance of four former Stan
; ford winners of the contest.
Three former winners of the an
nual contest with the University of
California are now enrolled in the
Stanford Law School. Philip Cava
' lero, winner in '28, Robert Hume, '29
winner, and George Shibley, suc
cessful contestant in '31, have all
attended the practice sessions of the
Joflre squad and have given advice
to Stanford's aspiring debaters. Rob
ert Littler, winner in '25, now prac
i ticing law in San Francisco, has also
encouraged the Cardinal orators.
Since Stanford has the services of
Mary K. Morris, second place win
ner last year, and Leonard Bloom,
winner of third place in the extemp
i orancous speaking contest of the Pa
. cific Coast Forensic League, the
Cardinal orators are conceded a good
chance to keep the Joflre trophy on
i the "Farm."
Originally given in honor of Sadi
Carnot, France's martyred president,
I the award was changed to the "Mc
! daille Joffre" in honor of France's
I war hero, Marshal Joffre.
