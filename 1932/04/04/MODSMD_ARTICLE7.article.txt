# STRAIGHT "A" IS FOUR-YEAR FEAT OF JOHN FERRY
## 
### 
Mention of the name of the
town of Rogue River, Oregon,
may mean little to the average
reader. Neither, as yet, docs
the name of John Douglass
Ferry. The announcement,
however, that John Douglass
Ferry, of Rogue River, Oregon,
chemistry department major,
completed his undergraduate
career last quarter without
having received a grade less
than an A, is one that is cal
culated to arouse mingled emo
tions of wonder, envy, and
curiosity, to say nothing of
awe, in the breast of the aver
age Stanford student.
Ferry's own formula for the
acquisition of grade points
could not be obtained, but
there are probably a number
of Stanfordites who would give
a lot to know it. He is the
third person in Stanford's his
tory to graduate with a straight
A average. Studies alone do not
occupy the mind of this super-
Phi Bete, as he has been vice
president of the Glee Club, for
the past year.
