We'll show you how. Just put on this Springweight
DIIU KY. It's half a pound lighter per pair than winter
weight shoes. Tt will (believe it or nol) relieve you of
lifting 5,000 pounds a day in taking your 20,000 stops
around town. And the price is a big relief. In
black calf, correctly detailed with perforations.
