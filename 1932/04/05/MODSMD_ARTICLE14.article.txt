# House Passes Freedom Bill For Filipinos
## Bourbons Triumph Despite Hoover's Opposition To Independence 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4. (/P)—'The
House today advanced the national
aspirations of thirteen million Fili
pinos by approving, 306 to forty
seven, the Hare bill to give the is
lands independence in about ten
years.
The overwhelming vote was regis
tered in the face of strong adminis
tration opposition, surprising even
the most optimistic proponents of
Philippine autonomy.
Democratic leaders forced the is
sue to a vote after forty minutes of
debate under a suspension of the
rules. This parliamentary procedure
was sharply criticized by the Re
publicans.
Bill Goes to Senate
The measure now goes to the
Senate. On its calendar is a bill
sponsored jointly by Hawes (D,
Mo,), and Cutting (R., N.M.), pro
posing Philippine independence in
about seventeen years. A vote is
likely in a month.
The possibility of a presidential
veto for the Hare bill if it should
pass the Senate was voiced today
Blocks Action
of War, when newspaper men asked
his opinion, asserted he interpreted
the House action today as "just giv
ing President Hoover something to
veto."
Asked directly, immediately after
ward, if he was sure Mr. Hoover
would reject the measure, he replied
it was "very hard to determine what
the President will do."
Representative Bacon (R., N.Y.),
who read to the House a letter from
Secretary Stimson in which he
strongly opposed immediate inde
pendence, blocked an attempt to get
unanimous consent for considera
tion of the bill, but the necessary
two-thirds vote for suspending the
rules was obtained easily. All dis
senting votes were Republican.
