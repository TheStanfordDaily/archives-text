# BOURBONS WAR WITH PRESIDENT OVER TAX BILL
## Senator Long Challenges House, Asking More Faxes On Wealth 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4. </P) —
President Hoover and congressional
Democrats disagreed today over how
best to slash Government expendi
tures to help the billion dollar tax
bill balance the budget.
The President in a special mes
sage to Congress asked appointment
of a joint commission composed of
members of the Senate, House, and
executive branch to reorganize the
Government for the needed saving
of $200,000,000 or more in expendi
tures.
Bourbons Threaten
The Democrats promptly demand
ed that Mr. Hoover submit a pro
gram for reorganization and said if
they failed to get it they would go
ahead and slash appropriation bills
for the $200,000,000 total.
Mr, Hoover's message said the ap
propriations could not be cut $200,-
000,000 without wholesale Govern
ment reorganization. The Democrats
said he was "shirking responsibility"
by not proposing the reorganization
plan himself.
Meanwhile, the tax bill—the key
stone of the budget balancing pro
gram—reached the Senate amid a
roar of debate.
Long Attacks Bill
Senator Long (D., Louisiana)
opened an attack on the House bill
and demanded greater taxes on the
wealthy. He was promptly answered
by Senator Harrison of Mississippi,
the ranking Democrat on the Fin
ance Committee, who called for non
partisan action in the Senate on the
revenue legislation.
