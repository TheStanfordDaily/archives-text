### 
Tracing the position of women in
the progress of civilization, Mrs.
Mary Ritter Beard, noted labor and
suffrage worker, spoke yesterday in
the Women's Clubhouse on "Wo
men s Place iii the Civilizing Pro
cess."
Mrs. Beard pointed out that study
of history shows that women have
always been the center in the
launching of civilization, in the be
ginnings of the systems of abstract
thought, and at every point there
has been brilliant thought or de
cisive action woman's mind has
worked in co-operation with man's.
At the present time, Mrs. Beard
stated, woman's place is uncertain,
but in the changing intellectual at
mosphere of today she will con
tribute to the tide which will swing
the major economic crisis.
