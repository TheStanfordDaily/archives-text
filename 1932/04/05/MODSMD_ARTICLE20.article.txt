# College Youth Defended By Renowned Historian
## 
### Rolph Malloch 
A vigorous approval of modern
| college youth, together with a few
| choice remarks on politics, prohibi-
J Hon, and morality, were voiced by
Dr. Charles A. Beard, forceful, gray
j haired historian, before he left the
| campus for San Francisco yesterday.
Alternately serious and jovial, the
eminent author of many important
tomes asserted that he was "con
| vineed" that there is more thinking
done in colleges than anywhere
j else. "The present college genera
| tion is doing more pondering about
j modern problems than the students
jof the past. There wasn't much
I chance to think while studying
Caesar's Gaelic War.
% "The next election? 1 can't say

the country is suffering from over
prediction. The election depends
largely on the events of this com
ing summer, when the moratorium
| is up.
"Drinking in colleges? Well, 1
, don't get around with young people
j much any more. The trouble with
| prohibition is tlie enormous wealth
I and power that bootlegging has put
into the hands of the underworld.
"The morals of today's youth
aren't any worse than those of past
generations, The younger genera
tion has to take care of itself even
tuallyâ€”it may as well learn young.
My generation hasn't set such a
i marvelous example. But I'm not
| worrying about the modern colle
i j;'<m he can think for himself."
