# Indian Track Team Faces Hables Loss: Star On Sick List
## Eastman Plans Try At World's Half-Mile Record If Weather Conditions Permit; Ran Quarter In Easy 52 Seconds Yesterday 
### 
p HIST it was appendicitis. Then it was a sore heel. Then a tape worm.
And now it's sinusitis. Such is this season's satl story of the health of
Les Ilahles, Stanford's premier sprinter who, it was revealed yesterday,
is now in the Palo Alto Hospital after a sinus operation last Friday. Al
though there is a chance that Ilahles will he able to run in Saturday's
meet against the Olympic Cluh and S.F.U., this most recent addition to
his formidable list of injuries is hound to set his conditioning back to
some extent.

Meanwhile, Magician Ben Eastman plans on working a disappearing
act with the world's half-mile record if weather conditions permit on
Saturday. According to Coach Bill Ellington, Ben will try and add
Dr. Otto Peltzcr's 880-yard record
to his newly acquired world's quar
ter-mile mark in the triangular
meet.

Eastman in Shape
Eastman proved that he was in
shape yesterday when he ran two
easy 52-second quarters. Although
52 seconds is good time for a 440,
Ben plans on running the first lap
of his record attempt Saturday in
about that time.
Another Card combination quar
ter-niiler and sprinter—Frank Lom
bardi by name—has also been so
journing in the hospital, but it is
cxpected that he will be out some
time today. Lombardi has been in
temporary confinement because of
a stiff neck.
Jones Nears
World's Discus Mark
Bob Jones answered all questions
concerning his condition this season
when he threw the discus within a
couple of feet of the world's record
yesterday. Jones's best mark meas
ured 164 feet, which is 5 feet better
than his best official mark and per
haps 15 feet better than any other
discus-thrower not enrolled in Stan
ford has done this season.
Joining the list of improving In
dian spikemen are Wally Butler and
Bill Werder, who both leaped over
22 feet yesterday. Welder's best
mark was close to 23 feet, which
won't hurt the Card track prospects
at all.
Shot-putters Nellie Gray and John
Lyman got into the spirit of the
thing and gently tossed the iron ball
beyond the 49-foot mark. Gray in
particular looked good, and was
threatening the low wooden fence
that marks the end of the shot-put
pit seemingly without effort at each
toss.
