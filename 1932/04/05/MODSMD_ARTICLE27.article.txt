## 
### 
Speaking on "Serendipity," Dr.
Walter Bradford Cannon, noted sci
entist from Harvard University, will
speak tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
Dr, Cannon, who has spent more
than a quarter of a century in physi
ological research, teaching, and
writing, is renowned for his con
tributions to the medical and psy
chological world.
Outside of his purely scientific
work. Dr. Cannon has also been
widely recognized as a consultant,
and is a member of many scientific
committees and societies. His ser
vice during the World War was so
notable that the American and
British governments decorated him.
He is al the present time president
of the Medical Research Society of
the American Red Cross.
"Serendipity,'' according to Dr.
Cannon's explanation, is a word
coined to express the element of
chance in scientific experiments. The
results of many of the researches
which are attributed to the integrity
of thi' scientist, he insists, are the
outcomes of factors which appeared
incidentally during the course of
the work.
