WASHINGTON, April 4. (fl>)
Far-reaching changes in Hawaii's
system of administering justice were
proposed in Congress today after
Justice Department investigators had
reported "extreme laxity" in the en
forcement of law there.
The inquiry was made in response
to a Senate resolution adopted after
Mrs. Granville Fortescue, New York
and Washington society leader, and
others were charged with murdering
a native accused of attacking her
daughter.
'"No Criminal Rackets"
In a summary of the bulky report,
Assistant Attorney-General Seth W.
Richardson said he found no
'criminal rackets" in Hawaii and
reported that ''sex crime" seemed
far less than reported from many
cities and localities of similar popu
lation in the mainland.
Criticizing the officials for ineffi
ciency and playing politics, he
recommended the Federal Govern
ment "assume closer responsibility"
for law and order.
