# OFF-DAYS AND OLYMPIC TRIALS
## 
### 
Dink Ti'inpleton is a sick man, hut in spite of liis pres
ent physical incapacity Stanford's dapper track coach is a
long way from being inactive. Besides coaching his cinder
path athletes via the long distance telephone system, Dink
has recently found time to hit at a glaring defect in the
American plan of choosing track men for the Olympic
team, namely, the red tape which makes no allowance for
the possibility of an off-day on the part of a big star who
fails to qualify in the tryouts.
Many colleges and clubs have had occasion to bemoan
the rigidity of A.A.F. rules in this connection, and Stanford
has especia. ground for complaint as the result of the 11)28
trials. The case of Hud Spencer is well known, but he was
not the only outstanding Indian to miss a deserved berth
on the I'.S. Olympic track squad. Ross Nichols, one of the
two or three leading high hurdlers of the country, was
eliminated because he hit a hurdle that was out of line in
the ii 11 ul tryout race, while Eric Krcnz, intercollegiate dis
cus champion, failed to qualify in that event when an of
licial failed to mark his best throw.
All such lapses on the part of oflicials and all temporary
physical let-downs by leading athletes could be taken care
of by the injection of some elasticity into the rules govern
ing selections for the team. Templelon has made no
definite suggestions along this line, but the problem does
not appear to be impossible of solution. Probably the most
wo kable scheme would be to allow the head coach a cer
tain amount of leeway to disregard the ollieial results of
tryout competition. The coach of any ordinary team is free
to include in his entry list for a meet men who have not
done very well in pre-mcet time trials but whom he knows
can do better nine out of ten times.
If Ren Eastman lost a shoe at the beginning of a 110 or
«S«SO time trial a few days before the I.C. 1A gathering at
Rerkeley this summer, Coach Templelon would not keep
his world's record holder out of the meet simply because
he did not win that trial. The same freedom, possibly un
der certain restrictions, should he allowed an Olympic
coach.
Although it is not probable that any action will be taken
before the trials here in July, it is not too early to begin
working toward an improved plan for the HKW team selec
tions. The slow moving nature of the A.A.I . makes long
continued agitation necessary for the accomplishment of
concrete results.
