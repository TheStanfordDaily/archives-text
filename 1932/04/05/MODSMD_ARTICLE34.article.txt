During the early (lavs of autumn quarter last year when
returned students were gaining their iirst taste of college
life in times of acute financial stress, somebody tired of go
ing dateless week-end after week-end hit upon the "de
pression dance" scheme.
It was a great idea. Besides providing a decent evening
for the small consideration of one quarter, it offered means
for knitting the Farm into a more compact social unit. The
first one was a big success.
Then as these dances gained increasing popularity
among students during the dark days of the hard winter
jusl past, a complication developed. News of the cheap
entertainment spread throughout the Peninsula, and the
dances began to lake on the aspeet of informal gatherings
of unemployed from Menlo Park and vicinity.
The Daily warned of what would follow if nothing was
done, proposing that a fine slogan would he "Campus
Dances For Campus People." Hut il was unheeded. The
result was that the lasl affair, though a rousing financial
success, perhaps, was a sorry failure as a social function.
Saturday night there will be another "depression dance"
in the Women's (iym. Thanks to the foresight of its spon
sor, Ca.p . • ! (iown, students can go and pay their two-bit
line without fear of walking in to find themselves virtually
alone among a gathering of "outsiders."
For the senior women's honorary society litis taken the
simple step that was suggested long ago. No couple will lie
admitted which cannot produce a student body card.
Thus the affair will be as it should be, truly a "Campus
Dance For Campus People."
