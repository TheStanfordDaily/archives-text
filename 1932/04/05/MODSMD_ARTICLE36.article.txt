Slowly an idea emerges—it ex- J
! pnnds—is taken over by the masses j
j —and then becomes ir removably
| fixed in the public hall of fetishes—
• absolutely as stationary as the walls
1 and floort of (he hall itself. To ques
i tion these ideas is bloody heresy,
j To disavow them is popular suicide.
! As a result, men who must fawn in
the public's grace, repeat to the
people these accepted notions and
consequently these ideas become
1 still more accepted; and those that '
prate about them become still more :
j unpopular; and the people become |
! more satisfied. Everybody prospers. I
One of these hoary intellectual ;
I curiosities which rouses great ap- i
j plause is universal college educa
i tion. Few people doubt the truth of !
; the idea. Going to college, now, is
; accepted like "America First," "by
! the people, for (he people, of the j
| people," "honesty pays" or any of ,
\ a great number of similar phrases. ■
| Some boys used to run off to the
1 sea or the circus or South America
j —now everybody is herded off to
, college without ever considering
I purpose or capacity.
| As a result, we find a terrible
j conglomeration of mis-fits at mod
; ern universities—people that don't
| know why they came, what they are |
j doing here, and probably without I

| the ability to realize the situation.
| As a result, after graduation a genu
ine problem is created. People have
been run through lour years. The
last June drops them oft' the mov
able belt with a disconcerting jolt
and looking lor a job.
What job is available? 'Being col
lege material we have developed a j
severe dislike as well as disgust for
manual labor. Being a mechanic, or j
a carpenter, is a marked come-down
1 from the realm of theory and col-
I lege gentlemanhood. To the white
I collar job we must go, demanding a
I salary that can maintain the pleas
; ures and tastes of this college at-
I mosphere. Increasing numbers of
i graduates—decreasing salaries — in
i convenience to graduates.
The cultural advantages of a
higher education are lost on most j
i undergraduates. There is little if
i any practical—that is monetary — i
! gain from these four years. What is
the solution? Make colleges prac
' tical say the Rotarians. That would
be ruinous to the much ridiculed
but nevertheless priceless "finer
things in life." The answer is to
cease this never-ending pressure
that drives hordes to college instead
! of the less-sophisticated but more
suited institutions that come under
j the head of trade and business
I schools. —Abe. Mellinkoff
