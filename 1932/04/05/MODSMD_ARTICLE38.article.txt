! SILVER CORD—At Palo Alto High
School Auditorium.
With a second performance of
Sidney Howard's "The Silver Cord,"
presented at the Palo Alto High
! School last Saturday night by the
Palo Alto Community Theatre, no
noticeable change either favorable
j or unfavorable could be detected,
I except perhaps in the characteriza
tions of Margery Bailey and Velma
- Converse. Both of them, having lit —
j tie competition, managed to snatch
I first honors during the evening. The
former, although delivering her lines
j in a very modilied and low tone,
1 succeeded in producing the back
! bone of the action by her gestures
and humorous recitations. The reac-
I tions of the audience could hardly
( be classified as sympathetic in re
| gard to her characterization, al
though the play in itself was semi
i tragic.
j Miss Converse, playing the part of
j Hester, succeeded in giving a very
convincing and worthwhile intcr-

, pretation of that part. Christina,
' played by Corinne Elkins, gave a
comfortable performance, although
somewhat handicapped by faulty
positions of the stage.
Richard Ogg as David showed im
provement, surpassing in smooth
ness and fitness the character of
: Robert taken by Robert Brauns.
; Both seemed a little young for their
parts. Vivienna Church, as the
| Mnid, fulfilled her duties easily and
I faultlessly.
Good direction, in a play of this
1 type, could have accomplished a
much more finished production than
was presented in spite of its ama
teur standing. —J.R.B.
Tobacco was introduced into Ja
; pan in 1593 which was as early as
or even earlier than its use in Eu
i rope.
Child ren of its alumni make up
i 12.5 per cent of the enrollment of
I Ohio Westleyan university.
