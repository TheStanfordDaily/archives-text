POOR WINDJAMMER
The Editor, Sir:
With reference to the article in
Thursday's Windjammer exposing
the traditional fallacies of Stanford
Junior Operas, we should like to call
wider attention to this columnist's
valuable statements.
Hallelujah and huzzah —At last
Stanford has found a campus jour
nalist (pseudonym J. Arlington
Doakes) who has fearlessly diag
nosed the "weakest part of the
(Junior) Opera .... the music."
A shrewd move—presto—let us
forthwith secure Gershwin, Berlin,
and perhaps De Sylva, Brown, and
Henderson to undertake musical
composition for our Junior Opera,
for as our '"Daily" sage neatly puts
it—"the music .... is plenty good
for campus composers, but not for
student audiences." Bravo (and
Gershwin is none too good, either).
But wait; still greater tasks re
main for our crusade. Our varsity
golfers are good in an amateur way,
but let's have Bobby Jones, Walter
Hagen, and perhaps Sarazen. The
best in the nation for Stanford is
our shibboleth.
This, we feel, serves to indicate
the possibilities not only in music
but in practically all lines of en
deavor. So why not Bugs Baer or
O. O. Mclntyre for Stanford readers
rather than the priceless observa
tions of our own Walter Wind
jammer? Sincerely yours,
Bob Thornton, '32
