WILLIE TEVIS, whose long goal
in (he extra chukker of the Castro
Valley-Del Monte Ranger polo game
at Beresford Sunday gave Castro
Valley an 11 to 10 victory, would
be a valuable addition to any quar
tet even il he left his mallet on the
sidelines.
About Ihe best thing that William
Jr. does is to take members of the
opposition out of the play. Not that
he clips 'em, or anything like that.
He "rides them off," as they say in
polo. That is, he takes them for a
canter down the field while his
teammate takes an unmolested sock
at the ball.
Tevis, who carries a six goal han
dicap, actually scored only that one
all-important goal in Sunday's
game, but because of his brilliant
riding was instrumental in holding
the flashy and ever-threatening
Rangers in check throughout the
afternoon.

IT WAS Cecil Smith who fur
nished the greatest thrills of
the nip-and-tuck contest. The
Texas cowboy brought many an
"Oh" and an "Ah" from the
crowd with tremendous long
shots, one of which carried 130
yards through the air for a goal.
Smith, incidentally, is rated at
<S goals, the same handicap as
that carried by the great Eric
Pedley.
There will be no polo at
Beresford next Sunday because
of the steeplechase to he held at
Menlo, but a match featuring
Pedley and Will Rogers is being
arranged for the following week.

BASEBALL SEASON will get !
under way on the Pacific Coast to- j
clay, with San Francisco meeting j
Seattle at San Francisco, Hollywood 1
crossing bats with Oakland on the 1
other side of the bay, Portland play- ;
ing at Los Angeles and the Missions |
at Sacramento.
Tanforan will close down in honor |
of the event, numerous grand- >
mothers wilj be laid to rest, etc., etc. I
Portland, although guilty of many ;
false promises at the opening of j
other seasons, is regarded as the |
team to beat ' in the race for the !
pennant, while the Seals, Holly- j
wood, and Los Angeles are expected -
to furnish the principal opposition. \
IT'S SIMPLY a case of an in- j
elastic demand, or an industry
of decreasing costs, or some
thing, as Professor Elmer Fagan
so clearly pointed out last quar
ter.
Lots of people want Big Game
tickets. Only a relatively small
number are available. There
fore. according to AI Masters, if
the proposed lft per cent tax on
college athletic events becomes
a law. the precious ducats will
cost $5.;"0 per each next fall.
