# GLEDHILL ABSENCE MAY PERIL CARD NET SQUAD

### WILLARD BUNGAY 
Will the absence of Keith Gled
hill, Indian tennis ace, who has ac
cepted an invitation to play in the
Mid-Pacific championships at Hono
lulu next week, cost Stanford the
conference championship?
That is the question that has wor
ried Farm tennis enthusiasts since
the blond racquet wizard announced
that he would not be able to par
ticipate in Stanford's next three
matches. These matches include the
one with Pomona this week and re
turn engagements with Southern
California and U.C.L.A. at Los An
geles.
It is a foregone conclusion that

without Gledhill the Indians will J
bow to the powerful U.C.L.A. team. j
Whether they can win from the Tro- 1
jans is problematical. Inasmuch as J
the score of the first meet with
Southern California was 5-3, it is
reasonable to suppose that Stanford
should have an even chance of re- i
peating, even without Gledhill.
That would leave Stanford and j
U.C.L.A. in a tie for the conference j
championship, providing, of course, I
that Gledhill returns in time to play j
in the California matches.
No difficulty is expected in Sat- j
urday's matches with Pomona, as \
the Trojans have already beaten i
them 9 to 0.
