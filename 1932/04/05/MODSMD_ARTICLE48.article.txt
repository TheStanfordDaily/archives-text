# INDIAN FROSH NINE HAS ANOTHER HARD GAME ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
From one hard ball game to an- j
other go the Stanford frosh.
Last Saturday the yearlings strug- l
gled for ten innings with the Cali- '
lornia frosh. Tomorrow the baby ;
I Redskins play the all-powerful San ;
j Mateo Junior College nine in the i
I ninth game of the season on the j
j old varsity diamond. Next Saturday |
| the l'ro.sh take on the Bear Cubs |
j again.
Tomorrow's game with San Ma- !
I teo will place the frosh in one of :
I the toughest spots of the season. !
! The game interrupts the Little Big
| Series with California and thus de
| mands a change in the routine prac
| tice for the series. The junior col-
J lege outfit, furthermore, is one of
| the few clubs that has defeated the
; Bear frosh this season.
| Carl Eitner, side-arm twirler of
i the yearlings, will be Coach Murray
| Cuddeback's choice for the mound,
j Fred Heringer, regular hurler, will
probably watch the game from the
I bench in preparation for another
I stab Saturday at the California
' yearlings. Charlie Emerick will
probably see service behind the
; plate.
The regular infield combination of
1 Mallatratt, Captain Woolley, Sem- j
! melroth, and Kurtz will patrol the |
I inner sanctions oÂ£ the diamond, 1
while Kahn, Meyer, and Symonds
will compose the outfield trio.

Rioting is one of the favorite occu
pations of Princeton students. Stu
dent uprisings have occurred since
ISOO.
