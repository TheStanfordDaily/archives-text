# SEQUOIA "ROUGH" UNEARTHS RELIC OF GAY NINETIES
## 
### 
Proud in the knowledge that
one of its residents has a dis
tinctive means of locomotion,
Sequoia Hull, last outpost of the
primeval Stanford "rough,"
.scorns the decorative Packards,
Chryslers, and Buicks which
grace the parking lots of other
campus dwelling places.
Warren S. Gage, 207 Se
quoia, a M.E. graduate student,
delving in the depths of the
basement storage rooms of
Encina, unearthed a tandem
bicycle. Having required only
minor tire repairs and a new
chain, the vehicle has now been
made ready for use.
Some forgotten Stanford
"queener" of the gay 90's left
behind him his sporty bicycle
built -for-two. Since no record
was found of its storage, Gage
claimed the tandem wheel by
right of discovery, and he is
now able to go riding with fair
members of the "500" without
patronizing the gasoline trust.
