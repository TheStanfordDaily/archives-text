# Will Rogers, Jr., May Make Varsity Polo Team
## 
### 
Will Rogers, Jr., turned out for
polo yesterday afternoon, and from
present indications should give first
string men a hard battle for one of
their positions.
Rogers is a one-goal man and
usually plays at number one. His
previous experience has included
playing on several Los Angeles out
fits. Freshman swimming has kept
him occupied so far this year, pre
venting him from turning out until
now.
Captain Gordan, polo coach, as
signed Rogers a berth on the A
squad. It is possible that he may
get into the game this Friday after
noon between the Reds and Whites
of this squad.
