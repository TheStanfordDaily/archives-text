# HILLMAN SEEN AS STAR PLUNGER OF 1932 GRID SQUAD
## First Scrimage Ragged But Whole Coaching Staff Sees Good Season 
### Maurice Rapf 
The current issue of the Stanford j
football team assumed its first sem- J
blances of form yesterday afternoon !
as Coach Pop Warner sent two se- '
lected squads through the opening j
scrimmage of the 1932 season.
It wasn't hard to tell that the j
scrimmage was the first of the year, j
but the men performed as well as j
could have been expected at such ,
an early date, what with only two ;
days of practice behind them. From |
now on, however, a daily scrimmage |
will be added to the regular drill in |
fundamentals.
Coach Warner had Jack Hillman !
at fullback on his first-string eleven, <
and Jack's ability in handling the j
ball substantiated the evidence given j
at the close of last season that he J
would develop into one of the best !
fullbacks on the coast before leav- j
ing Stanford.
Tommy Lambert and Bobby !
Maentz were the halfbacks with
Hillman in the backfield, while
Walker called signals. In the line .
were Albertson, center, Corbus and
Kite, guards, Lettunich and Pala
mountain, tackles, and Tod and
Rogers, ends.
Opposing this aggregation was a
line composed of Milligan, center,
Morgan and Card, guards, Keller
and Rogers, tackles, and Gillespie
and Buchanan, ends. Bob Moore of
last year's frosh team called signals
behind this forward wall and John
Hancock applied his 200 pounds of
beef to carry out the fullback's 1
duties. The halves were Sanderson ;
and Spencer.
There will be no practice today,
but work will continue tomorrow
and every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday for the rest of the quarter. .
