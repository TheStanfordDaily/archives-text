# Card Tankmen Hit By Loss Of Ted Wiget
## Axe Swimmers Go South For Annual Meet 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
When the Cardinal swimmers
travel south to U.S.C. for the annual
minor sports carnival April 15 and
Iti, they will enter competition
minus one of the three national
champions on the squad.
Ted Wiget, recent winner of the
national intercollegiate 440-yard
title, will not register in school this
quarter because of a number of
competitive opportunities this spring.
He is at present in the East com
peting in the national A.A.U. cham
pionships under the colors of the
Athens Athletic Club, of Oakland.
Four of the big five—Captain
Frank Booth, John McKelvey, Aus
tin Clapp, and Tuppy Gardner —will
go, however, and should be able to
walk away from any field the Tro
jans, Bears, or Bruins can offer. Es
pecially should the two national in
tercollegiate champions, McKelvey
and Clapp, demonstrate some fast
splashing.
As for water polo, the Indians will
have much more of a fight in this
department. Last year Stanford won
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title
from the Trojans by a small margin
—6-5 the first game, and 4-1 the
second. S.C. is still the major threat
this season.
Gordon Graves, who will replace
Ted Wiget as forward, is possibly
the "find" of the year. He is fast
and tough, and should fit in well
with Captain Austin Clapp and
Frank Booth, who will become the
mainstays of the team when they
return from the A.A.U. meet in the
East. Paul de Silva, star guard of
last year, has returned and, with
Donald Kinkead and cither Larry
Harris or Bob Clark as the other
two backs, the Cards should have
little weakness in this department.
