# MASTERS FORESEES DUCAT PRICE BOOST
## Raise Hinges On Passage Of Bill In Congress 
### 
Should the amusement tax section
of the new revenue bill, which is
before Congress, pass, tickets to
athletic events in which Stanford
takes part will be increased by the
amount of the tax, in the opinion of
A1 Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control.
The reason given by Masters is
that if the board were to assume the
tax, the loss from revenue would be
more than from the loss of attend
ance because of increased prices. It
is practically certain that the Big
Game will be a sell-out, even if the
fifty-cent tax is added to the price j
of the tickets, Masters said, and a '
loss, of about $40,000 would have to j
be sustained if the price of tickets}
were not raised.
Alihough no definite plan has i
been formulated, it is probable that i
student and rooters' tickets to minor !
games will be lowered enough to I
evade the tax. However, student i
tickets to major games will be j
boosted enough to cover the in- i
creased cost.
