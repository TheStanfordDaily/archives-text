# RED, WHITE POLO MEN NAMED FOR GAME ON FRIDAY
## Gillham Leads Whites; Holt To Lead Reds; Whites Doped To Win 
### 
With starting line-ups definitely
announced, the Reds and Whites,
warring factions on the polo A
squad, are concentrating in their
final practices this week lor the
match scheduled between these two
outfits this Friday afternoon.
On the Reds, Parker Holt will play
at number one, and Loyal Crawford
at two. At the three and fojir posi
tions will be Pete Lewis and Bruce
Fleming, first-string men whoso
flashy playing has been largely re
sponsible for Stanford victories in
the past.
Whites Balance
Wearing the white jerseys will bo
;i quartet that is a little better bal
anced as a team, although less bril
liant individually. Pete Gillham and
Rufus Spalding, first-team players,
will be at number one and two.
Woody Melone and Ed Boyles will
play the three and four positions.
The Whites are given a slight
edge over the Reds because their
team is made up of players of more
nearly the same ability. Lewis and
Fleming for the Reds make a tough
defense to crack, however, and if
the Whites do manage to push over
a victory, it will only be by a one
or two-goal margin. *
Regulation Match
The match will be a regulation
six-chukker affair and will be run
off the same as any intercollegiate
match. Hostilities begin at H o'clock
Friday afternoon on the Highway
field. There will be no admission
charge.
