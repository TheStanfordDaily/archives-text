# CHARLES BEARD SPEAKS BEFORE PACKED HOUSE
## Well-Known Student Talks Before Assembly On Modern Problem 
### 
An all-University assembly yes
terday morning heard Charles A.
Beard, famed political and histori
cal student, develop a topic which
might best be titled '-Technology's
Challenge to Representative Gov
ernment."
"The challenge to representative
government as I see it," he declared,
"is not the challenge of dictator
ship. It is technology, with its ideas
and its potentialities."
After reviewing the history of
representative government, the fa
mous author pointed out the re
sults of improved technology —
emancipation of the human body
and increased transcendency of the
limits of nature. As a result, "For
the first time in the history of the
world man stands in the presence
of infinity that can be controlled
by his own hand."
Coming to his own realm of pol
itics, Dr. Beard pointed out the
manner in which technology has
erased the original boundaries em
bracing government functions, as
"increasingly governments are re
lying upon various branches of
technology."
Carrying the theme still further,
he declared the causes of our mod
ern economic evils to lie largely in
technological developments and the
maldistribution of wealth. Thus the
problem that faces the present gen
eration is that of the distribution of
wealth created by this technology.
Dr. Beard preferred to be intro
duced simply as a dairy farmer
from southern New England rather
than as a world-renowned authority.
Such lecturing authorities, he con
tends, are most useful as yardsticks
by which the students may meas
ure their own professors. He claims
the visiting authorities do not dwarf
the home faculty, but, rather, en
hance it.
