# EASTMAN JOGS AROUND TRACK TWICE IN 1:54
## Postpones Record Attack To Weekend Meet If Weather Permits GIBERSON IN FAST 440 DeGroot, Miller Work Out; May Vault Saturday 
### Dick Strouse 
Fighting hard to keep from break
ing the world's 880-yard dash rec
ord in just a practice workout, lop
ing Ben Eastman managed to hold
himself down to a 1:54.5 half-mile
yesterday while training for his
probable attack on the recognized
world's mark Saturday afternoon
when the proper officials, crowd,
newspaper men, and photographers
will be present.
Eastman, who eased around the
track in his customary modest man
ner, was forced to slow down to
nearly a walk in the third 220 of
his race to prevent any premature
record-breaking. Ben ran his first
440 in 52.8 and then somehow con
sumed 32.2 seconds while jogging
the next furlong. He finished with a
speedy, effortless flourish.
Nash, Lomhardi Work Out
Paul Nash accompanied Eastman
on the first half of his training jaunt,
and Frank Lombardi brought him
in. Both men were running easily,
but second place among the day's
performances goes to Ralph Giber
son.
Gibey, who is and has been a
sprinter by desire, ability, and or
ders from Dink Templeton, joined
the growing list of Card dash-men
who have suddenly acquired quar
ter-miling aspirations. He ran a lap
in 50.5 seconds yesterday in his first
attempt at a 440 since last year.
Brugman Takes Meier
Jack Brugman and Gus Meier
continued their rivalry for the high
hurdle championship of Delta Tau
Delta and the Indian track team,
with Brugman winning two full
flights, both in 15.3. Meier dropped
out of the first race when he hit a
hurdle or so, but was beaten fairly
in the second.
Coach Bill Ellington's two injured
pole-vaulters, Bill Miller and Bert
DeGroot, were both out yesterday
out it is still unknown whether they
will be able to compete against
3abin Carr, Jack Wool, etc., in Sat
jrday's meet with the Olympic Club
jnd S.F.U.
Laborde Improves
The massive Here Laborde, who
loesn't seem to realize that it is
lownright disrespectful to challenge
he supremacy of a teammate who
s the 1.C.4-A. champion, continues
o keep close to Bob Jones in the
liscus. Laborde has thrown the
olatter 161 feet in practice, while
he third Indian disk-twirler—Nel
ie Gray—has surpassed the 153-foot
nark.
Because Ben Eastman will be
unning the 880, Les Hables is in
he hospital, and Captain Alvin
lables is not yet in the best of
:ondition, Ellington and Templeton
ire still searching for quarter-milers
or Saturday's meet. High-jumper
Don Blackman tried the 440 yester
iay, and ran his lap in 52.8.
