NEWARK, N.J., April 5. </P) â€”
Bishop James Cannon, Jr., of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South,
tonight warned both political parties
that the inclusion of wet planks in
their presidential platforms would
arouse dry opposition.
Addressing the Newark conference

he called upon President Hoover,
as the probable Republican nominee,
to demand that his party reject
proposals for a wet declaration.
