# COLIC FATAL TO PHAR LAP AT ATHERTON
## Damp Feed Held Cause Of Sudden End Of Famed "Wonder Horse" 
### 
ATHERTON, April 6. (TP)—Phar
Lap is dead.
At the peak of a racing career that
stirred the admiration of two con
tinents, the Australian "wonder
horse" died in his stall on the Ed
Perry ranch at Atherton in San
Mateo county yesterday.
The 6-year-old gelding, second
greatest money horse in turf history,
and probably the most valuable
piece of horse flesh in the world,
succumbed to an attack which
trainers and veterinarians diagnosed
as colic.
Food to Blame
Barley and alfalfa eaten from an
adjoining field by the animal, whose
every meal was cax*efully watched
and measured, brought on the ail
ment, snuffing o,ut a life that David
J. Davis, San Francisco owner of
the great mount, valued at $500,000.
Heavy dew had fallen on the barley
and alfalfa field. The wet green
feed, munched through a fence,
proved fatal.
Phar Lap was ailing at 6 a.m. yes
terday when Tommy Woodcock at
tempted to "run off" the attack.
Failing, he summoned Dr. William
Nielson, veterinarian of the retinue
that accompanied the racer from
Australia.
Hint Poisoning
Dr. Nielson, leaving his bed to
answer the call, found the horse in
a serious condition. Heroic efforts at
treatment brought no result. Dr.
Caesar Masuero, San Francisco vet
erinarian, was summoned. When he
arrived at 3 p.m., Phar Lap was
dead.
Although both doctors agreed on
the diagnosis of colic, rumors spread
that the death was not due to na
tural causes. Because of these re
ports, Perry announced that upon
the arrival of Davis an autopsy
v/ould be performed.
