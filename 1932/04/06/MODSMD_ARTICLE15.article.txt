# Whole World Now Eats From Campus Crockery
## 
### 
| From Boston to Shanghai and
| from Lower California to Juneau
lies scattered in cupboards, kitchen
drawers, medicine chests, and buf
fets silverware which once graced
the tables of Encina Commons,
Roble, and the Stanford Union. Like
I the British Empire, the sun never
| sets on the spoons, forks, and knives
i whose shapes and monograms are so
| familiar to two generations of Stan
ford students.
Encina teaspoons were recently
discovered mingled with the native
ones in a college dining room of New
England, while an Encina fork was
I observed as far south as Mexicali,
j among the indigenous cutlery of a
! ranch house.
Roble silver does not travel on
I the scale that the others do, nor does
! the Union silver scatter as badly as
that of Encina. Annually sacks of
! Encina silver, dishes, glasses, and
linen are regained from the men's

I dormitories. Although Berkeley po
lice periodically comb University of '
California fraternities and sororities i
for missing hotel and restaurant
i property, the Row, which is reported j
to possess i goodly portion of En- j
cina and Union equipment, is not j
j searched.
According to Miss Christine Kick
er, director of dining halls, Encina j
j last year found it necessary to re
place 75 dozen teaspoons, 8 dozen 1
butter spreaders, and 4 dozen 1
knives and forks. Few pieces had 1
j been worn out; the majority had i
; started on extended tours. The loss 1
I is put on the balance sheet under :
j the heading of depreciation, and the i
i students pay for it in the end.
| Nor is the flow entirely from the
j campus. Frequently samples from j
other college dining halls and San
| Francisco and Los Angeles hotels j
! and restaurants appear on campus
tables.
