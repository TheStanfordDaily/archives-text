# Struggle For Title Of Masque Ball King Opens This Morning
## Contest Centers Around Choice of Running-Mate of Prospective Sovereigns; Castilleja or Mills Versus the Stanford Woman 
### 
"I hereby announce my candidacy for the kingship of the Masque Ball
with Helen Judd (left) of Mills College as my proposed Queen."
This announcement, signed by Rob "Import" Taylor and deposited with
Ed Boyles last night, came as the first definite entry in the race for royal
honors which begins this morning in the A.S.S.U. offices.
Taylor, president of-Sequoia Club, is being heavily backed in the race
by the Hall men. His campaign manager, Art Miller, said last night in
preparation for the struggle for feminine supremacy: "Sequoia will not
tolerate the undemocratic attitude maintained by Stanford women. We

will back Rob to a man because we
see in him and his proposed queen
a means of putting Stanford women
in their place for all time!"

This announcement, signed by Rob "Import" Taylor and deposited with
Ed Boyles last night, came as the first definite entry in the race for royal
honors which begins this morning in the A.S.S.U. offices.
Taylor, president of-Sequoia Club, is being heavily backed in the race
by the Hall men. His campaign manager, Art Miller, said last night in
preparation for the struggle for feminine supremacy: "Sequoia will not
tolerate the undemocratic attitude maintained by Stanford women. We

will back Rob to a man because we
see in him and his proposed queen
a means of putting Stanford women
in their place for all time!"

evening revealed that '"Ike" Liver
more's Roundup, Maxine Yaples, has
entered the contest with that gen
tleman as her man .... or king, as
it may be. Livermore is in the habit
of holding a rodeo every year, so
this will be some throne for him to

Livermore Ls expected to go far with
"Smoothie" Yaples.
Frosh Candidate
A declaration from Rally Commit
tee headquarters stated that 'Panzee
Targhetta is expected to file inten
tions to run today .... after Ed
Boyles, if he can be found.
Rumors from the Class of '35 point
to efforts on the part of freshmen
to put. up several freshman candi

on the Row indicate that the "500"
will put up a pretty stiff battle
against the intense foreign compe
tition.
