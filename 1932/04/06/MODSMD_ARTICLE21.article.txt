# FATE OF MEN'S RUSHING PENDS
## New Rules Await Sanction By Board Of Control 
### 
Whether the Class of 1935 will be
rushed this year or next will be!
decided when the, Interfraternity !
Board of Control meets tonight in ,
the Old Union.
The main basis for the decision i
will be the set of resolutions and '
recommendations drawn up by the i
Interfraternity Council at its meet- |
ing last Tuesday. At that time, the j
Council voted: To acquaint the :
freshmen with the rushing rules; to j
punish all men and houses partici- i
pating in illegal rushing in the fu- I
ture; to provide a more tenable j
rushing system: and to require, from '
each house president, at each i
monthly meeting of the Council, an |
oath that his house has participated
in no illegal rushing since the pre
ceding meeting.
The Interfraternity Board of Con
trol is the ruling body of all the i
houses, holding control over the
Council. It is composed of alumni, j
faculty members, and representa- '
tives from the Row. The Council is 1
composed of house presidents and :
one representative from each house.
While the Board is the ruling
body, and the resolutions of the !
Council were only recommendations, :
the latter body hopes that the Board
will feel that it does wish to co
operate, and that, acting on the
recommendations, it will rescind its ,
former action and permit the Row to
rush in the spring quarter as usual. ;
