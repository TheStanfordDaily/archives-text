# DRAMATIC READING TO BE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Noel Coward's latest success, '"Pri
vate Lives," will be read at an open
meeting of Sword and Sandals,
honorary dramatic fraternity, tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre.
This work of the prominent Brit
ish actor-playwright is a drawing
room comedy which is carried along
by its speedy dialogue and excellent
humor. Those who recall the pro
duction of Coward's "The Young
Idea" here two years ago may have
an idea of the amusing light style
characteristic of his work.
The well-known campus actress,
Peg Randall Converse, will read the
role of Armanda, the female prota
gonist, opposite James Lyons as
Elyot. Both Mrs. Converse and
Lyons are expected to make the
most of these tempestuous and
flighty characters. Their interpreta
tion of the roles will be especially
interesting since Mrs. Converse and
Lyons have been cast opposite each
other in the forthcoming Dramatic
Council production, "Romeo and
Juliet."
Virginia Clemens, as Syble, and
Bob Cathcart, as Victor, divide the
task of separating the usual triangle
into a four-sided erotic and erratic
whirl.
Vail ejo Gantner, president of
Sword and Sandals, will preside and
interpolate the action with stage di
rections. Those who read will be in
evening dress and will sit around
a table; the intimate tone of the
comedy thus being emphasized. No
admission will be charged, and the
public is invited.
