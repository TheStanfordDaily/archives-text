# THE 						STANFORD INQUSITION
## 
### 
Methods reminiscent of llio Spanish Inquisition and
paralleling the modern third decree of the poliee were
employed at the joint meeting of the Men's and Women's
Councils last Monday night in the trial of certain members
of a geology class, many of whom were women, who were
susj)ected of cheating.
The students under suspicion were closeted in separate
rooms until they appeared before the Councils. I'pon be
ing brought in, they were subjected to a cross-questioning
usually reserved for hardened criminals, in an effort to
trip them up on a minor or even irrevelant point.
One girl was informed upon facing the Councils that a
girl just previously questioned had confessed that she was
guilty and had also said that this girl was implicated. The
girl facing the inquisitors denied the accusation, and found
out afterwards that the* other girl had neither confessed
nor implicated her but that the scheme was a trick to force
her into an admission of guilt.
In using such tactics the Councils are not only over
stepping the bounds of decency, but arc working against
their own interests, which are the preservation and main
tenance of the Honor Code.
The Men's Council lias instigated an educational plan in
an effort to instill in the students a sense of honor neces
sary for the success of the I lonor ('ode, which consists of an
abhorrence of cheating and a willingness to report violalers
of the Code.
Police court methods will cause the students to regard
the Counci . as a force, inimical to their welfare, which
they should frustrate in every possible way. Without stu
dent co-operation the Councils can accomplish nothing and
the Honor (-ode will be a failure. Such co-operation can
not be gained by roughhouse tactics. Instead they will
force the students to band together against a body which
seeks to bulldoze them into an admission of guilt, espe
cially when in many instances the student may be innocent.
Perhaps the Councils should not be criticized too
heavily. The present system is iu a stage of trial and the
Councils have erred. If they realize their mistake and cor
rect their methods, the damage done can be* quickly re
paired.
