Students who walked into the first session of Chester,
Howell's political-seience course in current interna
tional politics last Monday were hit sharply in the eye by
the most startling display of commercial advertising ever
seen in a classroom on the Quad.
Large placards hearing five-inch high black letters
printed on a naming red background, one on either side of
the speaker, vied with Howell for the attention of the stu-i
dents throughout the two-hour lecture.
Investigation absolved the administration, the political
science department, the e\ committee, the Chronicle, and
even Rowell himself of responsibility for the miscarriage.
Kaeh of the first three has power to grant permission for
posting of advertising especially beneficial to students
within certain limits on this campus. In Ibis case no one
of these authorities was approached, and each frowned per
ceptibly when informed of what had happened.
It finally developed that the indiscriminating initiative
of an over-ambitious campus circulation agent of the
Chronicle had taken it upon himself to violate administra
tion policy and common sense without authority of any)
kind.
The damage is done there is nothing to rectify now.
lint if things of this sort are allowed to pass unnoticed,
other merchants anxious to advertise their wares through I
the excellent medium of classroom sign boards are likely
to follow suit until the Quad begins to resemble a large
barn in a country village the week before the circus comes i
to town.
A group of 1 Diversify of North Carolina students, and
not all of them freshmen, have signified their willingness
to participate in a national campus marble tournament if
they can discover worthy competition. This is another indi
cation that the modern collegian can be care-free and still
"knuckle down" to business. I Pniii/ llrnin.
