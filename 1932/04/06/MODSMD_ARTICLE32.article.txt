# BULL SESSION
## COPYING THE FORM 
### 
In a world with so many people |
in it, one can'find most anything. 1
And most anything was discovered
the other day down near San Luis
Obispo. This time it happens to be
a half-naked religious cult that
sports itself in the wilds living on
nuts, fruits—and possibly raisins if i
they can find any. Why do these ;
people act in such an extraordinary
manner? Generalizing, we can say
they are trying to imitate various
holy men in history—or spiritual j
legendaries from the East.
Holy men have lived in this
fashion. Hence, they reason, living 1
like this will make us holy. Or per
haps, it is only the exterior that at
tracts—and not the essence at all.
There probably is some sport as well
as great economy living in the wilds
dressed in sun-tan and a loin cloth
and eating simple foods. Spirituality
offers a great excuse for such un
conventional habits.
But in more things than spiritu
ality, we find people imitating the
form and, by doing that, feeling they
are reaching the core. Many are the
campus journalists that feel almost
moral compulsion to smoke packages j
of cigarettes, swear like troupers, t
and play poker at the slightest
provocation. Why? Because all 1
movie reporters do these things and j
because many genuine metropolitan I
journalists do so as well. They feel'
akin to the great news-gatherers of i

! history by performing little things |
these men may have done.
But not only journalists are so ad
dicted or afflicted. Complete impar- j
tiality merely places them first. (
Then there are campus actors. Great !
players have the lure of tempera- j
meat and eccentricity hanging
around them and over them—a veri- i
table mass of haloed attraction for
the masses. Therefore, these em- j
bryo thespians feel that they too ;
are reaching the ranks of the dra- I
matic great by being "delightfully j
different"—and by the same token i
! slightly perturbing to the rest of us. |
But why stop here? There are on j
this as well as any campus a host !
(a small host) of people that are :
trying to live some part. Geniuses j
are held to be peculiar; in fact, their 1
peculiarity is all that we usually !
know about them. Then it follows
that individuals who feel they are j
or are to be geniuses, must display |
these same or perhaps originally dif- |
ferent characteristics.
True, it stamps them as different; I
but that it marks them as belonging I
t othe genus or genii is not only a !
horse of a different color—but two !
i different animals altogether. The !
! genius is essentiall distinguished by j
1 his accomplishments—not his annoy- i
; ing eccentricities. We are forced to j
I accept the latter because we desire i
1 the former. But the latter alone are |
! ridiculous. —Abe Mellinkoff I
