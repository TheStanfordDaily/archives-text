The Editor, Sir:
In reply to your editorial of April
first, stating that the W.A.A. Board
i was not working toward intercolle
giate athletics for women, I should
like to call to your attention a few
I facts.
In the first place, as we were host
ess to Mills and California for the
Triangular Sports Day and as they
i refuse anything in the way of in
tercollegiate competition, we could
hardly force it. We did the next best
thing which was acceptable to both
! sides, namely, playing straight class
teams, something which had never
been dune in the past.
During the basketball season we
voted unanimously favoring inter
! collegiate competition and were un
i able to find any opponent who would
meet us on that ground, so, in order
I to have any outside games we played
| on an interclass intercollegiate basis.
| In the case of tennis and golf you
I stated that our department would
' allow intercollegiate competition and
| that we just wouldn't arrange any
matches. May I ask you to withhold
; your condemnation of us in that re
! gard until the end of this quarter?
j Tennis and golf are spring quarter
; W.A.A. sports and so we would
j hardly be prepared until this term.
We appreciate the support you
i have given us in the past in our
i efforts toward intercollegiate ath-

letics and hope you will continue j
your policy. If you had ever at- }
tended a meeting of representatives
of Western Athletic Associations or
had ever tried to arrange a game
on the intercollegiate basis, I think |
you would understand our predica- :
ment.
Yours for better women's sports,
