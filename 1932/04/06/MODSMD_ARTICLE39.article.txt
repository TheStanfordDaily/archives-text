A WHITE BIRI) FLYING—By Bess t
Streeter Aldrich. 1). Appleton &
Co. 1931. (At tlu« Palo Alto Book j
Shop.)
Once again a girl must choose be
j tween two careers —doubtful literary
j success plus her uncle's fortune and
J marriage with a handsome fanner
1 plus probably three children and
! dirty dishes in the sink. Just when
j career number one seems to be win
j ning, love gains the upper hand and
; the result is the expected children ■
I and dishes. As a matter of fact, the !
only persons doubtful about the (
j outcome of this story are the char- |
I acters in the book, and even they j
■ might have guessed.
i The redeeming features of the
; novel are the characters, several
being remarkably well done, though
that of the girl is not satisfactorily
l drawn. Some scenes and portions of
the book are written in the manner
1 of a Hearst editorial, childishly, es
pecially the first chapters which
make the reader a martyr if he
J struggles through them. —B.P.
IMPERIAL PALACE—By Arnold
i Bennett. Doubleday, Doran & Co..
j Inc. New York. 1931.
| Although this book is sure to be
compared with "Grand Hotel," its
: resemblance ceases with the fact that
the locale of each story is a large
modern hostelry. "Ghand Hotel" was
j a rock against which bits of the
' 1 floating population were thrown, to
I be bounced back changed almost
i beyond recognition. Imperial Palace
Hotel is a huge, harmonious, com
■ posite machine with an individuality
j —each employee a cog, yet indi
| vidual also. The 700 pages are filled
with minute, definite descriptions of
the mechanisms, and people, that
make a luxury hotel worth its
$15-up tariff. These descriptions are
i so interesting and such easy read
ing that even the regular skipper
over-of-descriptions will read them.
There is a slight plot dealing with
the human characters, most of them
; employees. Evalyn Orcham, manag
i ing director, tries an experimental
■ love affair with a "millionheiress,"
but finds that the hotel is more im
j portant' than she, swings a huge

merger of luxury hotels in England
and the Continent, and lastly finds
the right woman back in the Im
perial Palace.
The book is not essentially a book
of plot, but is the more interesting
for its trivialities. It is highly recom
mended as Bennett's last work—and
one of his best. —B.P.
ARE THESE OUR CHILDREN—At
the New Menlo Theatre.
This is an excellent picture al
though perhaps a bit too tragic. It
deals with an entirely different sub
ject than the general run of pictures
that is shown.
It is the story of jazz-mad high
school students running around
thieving, petting, and drinking bad
: hooch. It climaxes in a murder with
lan anti-climax of a murder trial.
The young ringleader is smart and
almost gets away with an acquittal
I but his pal breaks down and squeals.
The end is tragic, in fact so tragic
' that it almost spoils the picture. The
! story is one (if sorrow and there is
no happy ending to cheer the audi
! ence. It's a brazen exposure of the
i tactics of some of the members of
( the younger generation constantly in
i search of a fiction ideal of happi
; ness. Even if a bit too tragic, it's a
darned good show. —J.H.G.
