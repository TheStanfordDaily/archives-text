# Indian Babes To Meet Bulldog Tracksters Friday
## WIDE EDGE GIVES FROSH CINDERMEN CERTAIN VICTORY Brown To Try Half Mile; Munro And Joslin Are Out For Season 
### Albert Guerard 
A defeat every now and then is >
good fare for overconfident boxers j
and even for track teams, but, real- i
izing there can be too much of a |
good thing, Bill Ellington has sched- \
uled a meet for his freshman track- i
men with San Mateo Junior Col- (
lege, and unless the Bulldog track 1
and field stock booms before Friday i
afternoon, when the meet will be |
held, the Indians should not only I
score their first victory of the sea- i
son, but set up some kind of a high !
scoring record for Stanford track I
teams.
San Mateo lost a 95-27 meet to J
the weak San Francisco State j
Teachers, although the latter school i
is attended almost entirely by girls, j
After competing against teams |
drawn from two and three thousand j
students, Stanford's yearling hopes j
will be glad to compete against an •
opponent of their own size.
Strong on Track
Very strong on the track, Stan- ;
ford will probably limit their junior j
college opponents to third places in |
the running events, although San |
Mateo may capitalize on Stanford j
weakness in the field events to pick ;
up a few firsts or seconds in these j
contests.
Since he is one of the best quar- j
tor-milers on the freshman squad, I
and an equally good miler, Bob i
Brown has decided to compromise j
these events, and try for the half- !
mile. Brown took his first two laps i
of the yesterday, and ran 2:16 j
in his sweat clothes. Brown has a i
lc;ng, reaching stride, and appears J
capable of giving Dave Devlin,
George Downing, and Walt Harris !
;i real battle after he has run a few 1
880's to accustom himself to the dis
tance.
