# Savage Takes Hurdles
## 
### 
Jim Savage led Frankie Bowles,
Andy Bright, and Robert Buffum to
the tape in a special freshman high
hurdle race yesterday in 17 flat.
Under stress of intercollegiate com
petition, Savage and Bowles could
probably cut this time to nearly 16.
They will have to in order to cope
successfully with MeVay and
Kindt, California freshman hurdlers.
Against San Mateo, however, Indian
hurdlers should score a clean sweep
in both' the 120-yard and 220-yard
races, as Hankins, the best San Ma
teo timber-topper, could take no
more than thirds against the slow
State Teachers hurdlers.
It now appears that Russ Munro,
brilliant freshman low hurdler suf
fering from an injured vertebra, will
be out for the season, or will be
unable to do any practicing before
the Little Big Meet on April 16. If
Munro and Joslin, discus star, and
both doubtful entrants, are unable
to compete, Stanford chances of nos
ing out the Californians will be slim.
