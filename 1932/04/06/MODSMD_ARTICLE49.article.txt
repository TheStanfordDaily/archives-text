IT WAS ALL very disappointing.
If Ben Eastman had taken five min
utes to run the 880 yesterday, the
good-sized crowd which assembled
at the Old Oval to see the blond
flash work out could not have dis
played longer faces.
You see, Ben had negotiated the
half-mile in 1:54.5, which was con
sidered very bad indeed for the
blazing one. The world's record be
ing 1:51.6, nothing less than 1:49
would have satisfied the assemblage.
But consider: That many, many
people would give a large sum to
be able to run 880 consecutive yards
in 1:54.5; That 1:54.5 would win
many, many half-miles; That East
man has not run this event, even in
practice, SINCE LAST YEAR; That
Ben was striving to run on a sched
ule laid out by Dink Templeton, and
that his failure to make better time
was largely due to misjudging his
pace in the third 220 yards, rather
than any lack of power.

THE FIRST 440 yards of the
trek Eastman negotiated on the
dot—between 52 and 53 seconds,
closer to 52 than 53. Then he
slowed down, and instead of
reaching the 660 post in ap
proximately 1:18, the watches
read 1:25. There was where all
the time went.
Then came the drive to the
finish. Turning on the power,
Ben traveled the final 220 yards
in 28.5 seconds to break the tape
in the aforementioned 1:54.5.
Eastman displayed a strong
sprint at the finish, showing he
had plenty of power left. Con
sidering the fact that Ben or
dinarily makes his best times
when running steadily, that
amount of strength expended in
the third 220 rather than in a
closing sprint would greatly have
reduced his time.
Disappointing? Keh, heh!

TRAGEDY STRUCK the racing
world yesterday.
After traveling half way around I
the globe to show America his |
I wares, Phar Lap, the great Austra- 1
j lian thorough bred, died yesterday at j
i Menlo Park following an attack of
i colic.
All connected with the .six-year- '
| old gelding were heartbroken last
! night—not alone because he seemed ;
| destined to prove himself the great- j
J est racehorse of all time, but be
| cause he was declared to be "almost |
] human."
I To see Phar Lap was to love him. j
| Unlike most racehorses, he was not
j nervous or flighty. When brought j
j out last week for his afternoon pub- j
j lie appearances at the Menlo track
j of Edward Perry, he amazed crowds j
j who came to see him by his docile |
j demeanor.
Jocky W. E. Elliot, who was
i brought from Australia to ride
Phar Lap to victory in his one
American race, the recent $50,-
000 handicap at Agua Caliente,
never used a whip.
"I just talk to him." Elliot
j said recently. In the Caliente
race, Elliot saw out of the cor
ner of his eye that another horse

was making a strong challenge
as they entered the stretch.
"Come on. Bobby, let's go," the
jockey whispered in Phar Lap's
ear, and "Bobby" thundered un
der the wire, an easy winner.
That Tommy Woodcock, the
youthful trainer ol' the "wonder
horse," thought of Phar Lap as
far more than a mere racehorse,
was shown by his every action.
He beamed proudly as he
brought out the beautiful geld
ing for his afternoon workouts,
as proudly as if he were the
owner.
Horse lovers everywhere will
be saddened by the death of a
great horse. —L.M.C.
