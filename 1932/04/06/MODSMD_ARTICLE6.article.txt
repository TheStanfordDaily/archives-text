Three Stanford debaters, Mary
Katherine Morris, Leonard Bloom,
and Isador Botasof will participate
in the annual Joffre Medal Debate to
be held in Wheeler Hall at the Uni
versity of California on Tuesday
evening, April 12th.
For three months the aspiring ora
tors have been studying the general
question, ''France and the Economic
Crisis." Two hours before the
speakers mount the rostrum a spe
cific topic will be selected and an
nounced by Professor Graham Stuart
of Stanford and Professors A. F.
Blanks and R. M. Russell of Cali
fornia.
Award Started in 1894
Way back in 1894 in the "Gay
Nineties," when tandem bicycles and
smart buggies were campus high
lights, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of
France started the annual award of
a medal to the speaker making the
best showing in an extemporaneous
debate between the two major uni
versities in California. Originally
the award was named in honor of
Sadi Carnot, France's martyred
president; but in 1917 the prize was
renamed the "Medaille Joffre" in
honor of Marshal Joffre, the French
war hero.
Cards Win Most Debates
Since Stanford has won the Joffre
contest in a majority of the times
it has been held, the Farm candi
dates for forensic honors this year
are doubly anxious to make a good
showing.
Mary-K. Morris was second last
year. Leonard Bloom placed third in
the annual Pacific Coast Forensic
League extemporaneous speaking
contest held at Pomona College dur
ing spring vacation. Botasof has
been a member of the men's varsity
debate squad for three years.
