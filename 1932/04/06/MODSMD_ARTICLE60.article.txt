# LIQUID AIR MAKES MAGIC IN SCIENCE
## 
### 
A steam engine running at 190
degrees below zero, a watch spring
burned to dust, and a ball of cotton
exploded with a poof!—these were
some of the semi-miraculous feats
accomplished by Dr. Edward C.
Franklin, professor emeritus of or
ganic chemistry, at a seminar in the
Chemistry Building yesterday after
noon, by the use of liquid air.
Many other experiments of an
equally unusual nature designed to
show the expansive power and abil
ity to support combustion of liquid
air as well as its low temperature
served to make the seminar a suc
cess. Phi Lambda Epsilon, national
chemisty honor fraternity, sponsored
the meeting and expects to hold an
other in two weeks.
