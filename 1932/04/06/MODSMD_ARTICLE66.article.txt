JACKSONVILLE, 111., April 5. iJP)
â€”Dr. Charles Henry Rammelkamp,
58. president of Illinois College since
1905, died at his home today after a
long illness. He had taught at his
alma mater, Cornell University, and
at Stanford.
Much concern is said to be caused
on account of the large numbers of
Chinese words that have crept into
the printed language of Japan.
