# CANNON TALKS ON CHANGE'S GIFTS
## 
### 
Explaining the part played in sci
entific experiments by what he
termed "gifts of chance," Dr. Wilter
Bradford Cannon, head of the Psych
ology department of Harvard Uni
versity, lectured on "Serendipity"
last night before an audience which
packed the Little Theater.
The discovery of unexpected
phenomena and the predominance of
the elements of chance were the
subjects of Dr. Cannon's talk. "Se
rendipity," he explained, is a word
suggested by Horace Walpole to
designate .incidental appearances in
scientific experiment which are
noted as great discoveries. "A great
part of the pleasure of the investi
gator lies in the fact that the ele
ments of chance are always about
him," Dr. Cannon stated.
Citing instances of serendipity,
Dr. Cannon mentioned Columbus'
discovery of America as probably
the greatest example. In his own
experience, Dr. Cannon described
the relation of the adrenal glands
and the sympathetic system to medi
cal and psychological facts. Dr. Can
non's own experiments and obser
vations have been notable in this
field.
