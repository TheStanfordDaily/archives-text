for the women.
Two definite moves towards in
tercollegiate competition were made
when the Board approved of Stan

women and another to be held with
| Phoenix Junior College. A motion
| to extend invitations to several col
elges to compete in intercollegiate
I golf, tennis, swimming, and archery
j tournaments was also passed. Defi
, nite arrangements for both will be
! made in the near future.
