JOLIET, 111., April 5. (/P) â€”An old
I and trusted convict, "tired of being
| shut up" and reverting to a pyro
! maniacal urge, today set fire to the
I stone chapel in the State Peniten
| tiary. Joliet tire companies and 300
[ convicts put out the blaze which re-
I suited in damage estimated at $5000.
Lyman Hall, a convict since 1897
I and a trusty most of the time since
j 1919, walked into the Deputy War-
I den's office in the old prison this
morning and calmly announced:
"I'm tired of the world. I'm tired of
I being shut up. 1 just set fire to the
1 chapel and I hope the whole place
! burns up."
