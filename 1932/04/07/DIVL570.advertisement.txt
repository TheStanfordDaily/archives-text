You KNOW
what you're getting
.... when you buy
advertised products
Many business men in the fore-front of
industry are putting themselves squarely on
record as recognizing this fact. Here' we
quote two more whose experience has
shown that the buying public is critically
aware of the advertising merits of various
brands:
S. E. Judd, general sales manager, Life
Savers, I nc. —The only way to increase busi
ness for the jobber, retailer and manufac
turer is to keep our message constantly in
front of the most vital parts in a merchan
dising scheme —the ultimate consumer.
James D. Tew, president, The B. F. Good
rich Rubber Company—Let an industry that
has advertised extensively reduce its adver
tising or cease to advertise and its volume
starts on the down grade. It has been said
that the buying public becomes suspicious
when a commercial institution that has
been prominent in advertising ceases to
keep the public informed of the quality of
its goods. This may or may not be true, but
there is no disputing the fact that more than
one business has found that it cannot aban
don advertising and survive.
