# SPIKESMEN MAY LOSE TO S.F.U. AND WINGED 'O'
## Don Tracksters Scheduled To Glean Points From Indian Total 
### 
Stanford's cinder stars will prob- :
ably succumb to Charlie Hunter's I
Olympic Club tracksters Saturday. •
Hunter, who is the head-man of !
both the Winged "O" and S.F.U. j
spikemen, will bring his two squads !
up to the Farm for a triangular ■
meet and figures that the points j
garnered by the Dons will detract
more from the Card than the Post 1
Street total and make possible a
revenge victory for the Club.
Bill Ellington and Dink Temple
ton, the Indian medicine men, al
ready outdanced Hunter and his |
Clubmen this season to a cheering j
67 1-3 to 63 1-3 tune, but with Lcs ,
Hables and Bill Miller probably out
of the meet, it is doubtful if the ,
Indians can repeat.
liig Bob Klcckner
Bob Kleckner and Ralph Monta- j
gue are the big shots of the S.F.U. !
team that should be able to dimin- j
ish Stanford's total without percep- j
tibly injuring the Olympic Club's j
score. Kleckner is apt to outdis- 1
tance Lyman, Gray, and Laborde !
in the shot-put as Big Bob has a j
handy mark of 50 feet 'l x k inches.
The Cards swept this event in ,
their earlier meet against the Post
Streeters, and will miss the points
Kleckner should win. The star Don
fullback may also garner a digit or
so in the discus, as he has twirled
the platter 149 feet inches
through the air.
Montague in Sprints
In Hables' absence, Montague is
outstanding in the sprints, although
Ralph Giberson may upset the
S.F.U. star in the 100. Montague has
run 9.8 already this year and has
also negotiated the furlong in 21.6
seconds.
The rest of the Don squad is but
mediocre, although Steve Dobbs
should garner points in one or more
of the distance races. Dobbs set
some kind of a record in the S.F.U.-
State Teachers College meet when
he won the 880 and the mile and
tied for first in the two-mile. Jim
Ferrie and Bob Atkinson of the
Cards, who yesterday ran three laps
in 3:19, and Carter of the Club, along
with Dobbs, should make the mile
worth watching.
Good High-Jumpers
Coggeshall, Jacques, and Ball of
the Club, Jones of Stanford, and
Alley of S.F.U., all capable of six
feet or better, will try to outleap
each other on the high-jump. A1
Ray, the leading Indian spear-toss
er, may have to do his best to get
i second in the javelin from Thomas
of the Dons. Churchill, last year's
| intercollegiate champion and now a
wearer of the Winged "O," should
i win easily.
Captain Alvin Hables of Stanford
ran a 51.8 quarter-mile yesterday,
which means he may compete Sat
urday. If he does, he will run
against Lombardi and Nash of the
Cards and Waltz of the Club. Tem
' pleton's George Naylon and Hun
| ter's Dick Wright will chase Ben
I Eastman around the track in the
1880, and either one will be satis
fied with a second place.
