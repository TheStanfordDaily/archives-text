# AN APOLOGY
## 
### 
The Men's and Women's
Councils apologize to the
young lady whose case was
brought to the attention of
the campus in the editorial
column of the Stanford Daily,
yesterday, April 6th, for the
misrepresentation made to
her.
Such tactics are indefen
sible, inappropriate to Stan
ford tradition, and not typical
of the Councils. The rest of
the procedure was a matter of
expediency. This public
apology is made willingly and
without compulsion.
