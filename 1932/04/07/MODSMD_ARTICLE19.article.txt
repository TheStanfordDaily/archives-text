# 'PRIVATE LIVES' READING IS HIT
## Big Audience Fills Litttle Theatre Last Night 
### 
By James Sandoe
i Sword and Sandals' infonnal read
| ing of "Private Lives," the first of a
! px-ojected series, was applauded
; loudly by an audience which filled
I the Little Theater last night.
Noel Coward's mad comedy has
| the advantages of brevity and wit.
i And, at the hands .of four exper-
I ienced actors, it received excellent
! attention. The reading had neither
the smoothness nor the mechanical
disinterest of a long played smash.
| Charmingly informal and swift mov
| ing, it delighted the audience.
Occasionally the enthusiastic ac
i tors rushed on as the audience
! laughed and a few lines were lost,
; but this was an advantage rather
than a fault. Another aid to the
i evening's enjoyment was the rapid
tempo maintained throughout by the
readers. The play never dragged.
As the fluttering lovers, Peg Con
verse and James Lyons were fine.
Both read very difficult lines with
1 an easy sophistication which was ex
quisitely funny. Bob Cathcart made
a fine Victor, serious and very
ridiculous in his grandeur. Virginia
Clemans, the least experienced mem
! ber of the cast, was good as Sybil,
I although at her best in the first act.
Sword and Sandals deserves praise
i for having undertaken the task
! which has all the appearance at
! present of being very successful in
| deed, as last night's audience at
| tests.
