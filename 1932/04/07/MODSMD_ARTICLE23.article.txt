# Stalemate Ends Interfraternity Board Meeting
## Council's Attempt to Advance Co-operative Proposal Delayed; Overwhelming Abundance of Facts Holds Up Solution of Problem WILL ATTEMPT TO REACH DECISION ON TUESDAY Four-Hour Session Last Night Result of Council's Desire to Have Rushing This Spring 
### 
: D USHING still hands on the decision of the Intcrfraternity Hoard of
Control.
After a four-hour meeting last night Board members adjourned until
next Tuesday without having taken action on the problem of granting
! spring rushing to the fraternities. The penalty inflicted last quarter post
poning all rushing of the Class of 1935 until next autumn quarter was
j protested by the houses in the form of a set of resolutions passed by the
Interfratcrnity Council.
Warren Biggs, chairman of the Board, stated at the end of last night's
meeting that the matter had become too complicated to be decided in a
single session, and that it would be necessary to hold another meeting in

order to condense the discussion
brought forward.
Shortly before the end of winter
quarter the Board decreed that the
houses could pledge no classes this
spring on account of the conviction
of all groups on the Row of par
ticipating in illegal rushing prac
tices. When the Interfraternity
Council, composed of house presi
dents and representatives, met, it
expressed the opinion that in the
light of the fraternities' desire to
co-operate toward a more tenable
situation in the future, the Board
should rescind its action.
The Council's resolutions sug
gested a new rushing system hav
ing a number of dates during win
ter quarter, a more severe set of
I>enalties, an oath by house presi
dents that their houses had en
gaged in no illegal rushing, and an
acquainting of the freshmen with
the existing rules.
In spite of fraternities' efforts to
clear up the difficulty, it is ques
tionable whether or not the Board
will withdraw its first decision.
Board members are Warren Biggs,
chairman; Johnnie Deuel, secretary;
Wayne Ketron, Larry Harris, Ike
Livermore, Tom Campbell, student
members. Faculty and alumni mem
bers are Shirley Baker, Jud Crary,
W. B. Owens, Elmer Fagan, and
George Culver, dean of men.
