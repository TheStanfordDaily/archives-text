# Campus Sheiks Tilt For Fair Maid As Queen
## Targhetta Enters Race With "Heaven-Eyes" Ricciardi 
### 
A technical foul scored late yes- i
terday afternoon in the Masque Ball |
race for royal honors placed a seri- |
ous doubt as to who will claim Max- j
ine (Kansas City's Cutie) Yaple as (
his queen for the day. Announced j
yesterday as Livermore's Roundup, j
Maxine was abducted by Jack ;
; (Portland Menace) Redhead and
j taken to the polls set up in front of ;
I the library that afternoon.
, According to Ed Boyles last eve- |
i ning, Maxine will be permitted to i
! run with both gentlemen High !
! man will take the girl. Late yes- j
| terday 25 votes had been placed on i
! the pair.
Rob (Import) Taylor, with his I
j Mills mate, Helen Judd, are leading (
j the race with 250 votes to their |
: credit.
Panzee Targhetta entered the con
j test, as previously announced, with I
j Pat (Heaven-eyes) Ricciardi as his '
i queen-to-be. This combination, with i
I 26 tallies in the struggle, should;
[ show plenty of strength in the next .
| few days. Panzee, often termed j
I "Ape-Man" by his intimates, is ex- j
pected to sweep the Rough vote,
completely.
"Montana Moon" Prelsnik rushed !
i right into the midst of things with j
j Marion Hewlett to mass 135 votes j
J this early in the struggle. Chuckling j
Prelsnik could do nothing but laugh j
i right out loud when asked for a j
I statement concerning things.
Other men to declare their candi- ,
j dacy were George (I Love Her)
I Gray; Mort (The Blush Man) Ful-i
: ler; Thad (I Never Touch It) Mc- 1

Peter (Full House) Lewis; Mar '
(Hot Shot) Albertson; Larry (Roble)
