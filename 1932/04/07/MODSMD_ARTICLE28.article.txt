If reports arc correct, (Columbia t'niversity has uncov
ered one of the outstanding professorial lights of (he age.}
Conducting a course in family relations at Columbia, this
oasis in a desert of dry pedagogy is declared to have oc
cupied the class time in expounding the advantages of free j
love to his siudenls.
Such a man intrigues the imagination. Students who
enroll in Ins course must enjoy the pleasant sensation of
drawing in a lottery, never certain of what will come forth.
The subject assigned evidently means nothing whatever
to this scintillating scholar. If he were scheduled to teach
French literature, he might be expected to regale the hardv !
souls sitting under him with arguments proving the in
feriority of Voltaire to Shaw and the consequent futility of
considering the works of the great French writer. Or, per
haps, the unsuitability of the Gallic tongue for the higher;
forms of literary art would appeal to him as more pertinent
to the subject.
At least, no Columbian ever need lack for novelty in ,
studies while a gem of this water remains on the faculty.
The Lord must have broken the mold when he made him,
but, since no adequate successor may be expected, let us
pray that he will not soon be lost to our intellectual firma
ment. I .ong may he live!
