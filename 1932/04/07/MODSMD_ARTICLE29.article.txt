# A 						FLY IN THE OINTMENT
## 
### 
Flies nu.y or may not have been put on this earth for'
some reason. At any rate, they are here, and humans have
no choice but to contend with them. For centuries man has
expended tremendous efforts in attempts to exterminate
them; ail of it has gone for naught. This spring there will!
probably be more Hies than ever.
Wby in heavens name, then, should man create a me-,
chanical fly which is probably more obnoxious than the
living insect it resembles? One of the spurious contraptions
operating hereabouts in the early morning hours has prob
ably created more discomfort on this campus during the
past week than the combined aggravation caused by three;
summers of God-made tlies.
How this two-cylinder glider with an outboard motor
attached ever stays in the air is a mystery. Hut it does; and j
as though that were not enough, it insists on puttering
around as near to the roofs of living quarters on the Row I
and elsewhere as is possible without actually Hying over
them. This, mind you. at early dawn, which, to the slumber
ing students below, might as well be the middle of the;
night.
I hey say at the Hying field that the best time to operate
this noisy freak of aviation is between the hours of five and
eight in I lie morning. We wonder if any one of them has
ever tried to sleep while a particularly persevering tlv]
buzzed about his face, lighting on it at intervals only long;
enough to be awav again before he could swat it.
