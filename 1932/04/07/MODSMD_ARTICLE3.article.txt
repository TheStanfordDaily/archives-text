### 
AN OPEN LETTER
The Cook
Alpha Delt House
Dear Sir:
I realize that you culinary
exports are sensitive upon the
matter of free advice, and I
hope you will not take offense
at my alarm. But the tragic
death of that famous racer,
Phar Lap, arouses in me a
clutching fear. Perhaps you are
so absorbed in tickling the pal
ates of your patrons that you
may not realize the ominous
significance which that event
bears in relation to the track
season which is upon us.
You have within your power
the precious life of a still more
famous racer, our campus hero.
I hope that before he suffers a
fate like that of the late Au
stralian. I may reach you with
this warning: Remember, Phar
Lap died of eating greens with
water on them; please do not
feed lien Eastman spinach!
