# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
One of the most maligned groups
on the Pacific Coast is the "500."
A good joke off the campus and a
stale joke on the campus, the women
stand tormented, ridiculed, and de
rided. What will be the effect on
Roble and Row if the Queen of
the Stanford Masque Ball happens
to hail from any place (including
Mills) off this Campus? The answer
to that question will be plastered
over every college daily in the West
and most of the metropolitan papers
as well.
Slowly—if Quad photos are in
dicative—the general level of pul
chritrude on this campus has risen.
But no matter how much it im
proved, it still had an ugly tradition
to cope with. That tradition de
tracted from the common estimate
of the '"500"; and woman has realized
that. Now, when they are in sight
of a new era—a golden era when
prejudice and unfounded tradition
will fade into nothing—yea, like the
profits of the Union—comes the
Masque Ball.
Failing to take the suggestion last
quarter, that we elect a queen and
allow her to choose her king—the
"500" are now standing on the brink
of the bottomless canyon of ridicule
—balancing perilously on the soft
edge. All that is needed to push
them over is the selection of a non-
Stanford woman for the Queenship
of the Masque Ball. That ihere is
such a possibility is unfortunately
clear. But what to do?
There is only one thing to do and
that is for the women to get together
and run one of their number in the

A STANFORD QUEEN

i current race. The ' 500" united can
; easily elect a Queen. They sell
| Chaparrals every month; they could
with greater ease sell some beauti
| ful, scintillating, fascinating creature
i to the roughs. Of course to find this
veritable incarnation of feminine
| grace and charm is a little more dif
ficult. than putting her over. But to
! save themselves, the "500" can prob
i ably pick a candidate.
There is no time for delay. There
I is no time for internal bickering or
' cattiness. The reputation of the "500"
is at stake—and anybody that real
' izes the news value in a non-Stan
; ford woman acting as queen of the
: Stanford Ball—can realize the hor
| rible truth in that statement. Once
; the women select a candidate, there
seems little doubt that she can beat
any male nominee. If the sororities
| and Roble can't agree on a candi
! date, auction the vacancy off to the
! group that will pay the highest, and
j then use the money to buy votes.
Do anything, but act to save the
reputation of the "500."
