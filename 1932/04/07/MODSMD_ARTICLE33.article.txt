WHAT ABOUT CONCERTS?

The Editor, Sir:
Do the students want the Concert
Series aoblished? Do they want the
only cultural asset on the campus
taken away? Once more the annual
question of the Concert Series is
before us. For years it has been
battled in the Executive Committee
meetings without having any defi
nite student opinion to base deci
sions upon.
It seems to me that in a question
so vitally affecting not only the stu
dents of this University, but the
good will and interest of the com
munity, and the reputation of the
University, that it is absolutely es
sential to have some idea of how
the students feel, Do they want a
Concert Series? Do they realize the
cultural significance of hearing some
of the finest artists in the world?
There seems to be a feeling on the
campus that the Concert Series is
always running in the hole. It has
cost the A.S.S.U. not one red cent!
If they want the Concert Series to
continue let's have some support at
the next concert. We shouldn't give
up the privilege of having the finest
possible artists at such ridiculously
low rates. I think it is up to the
students themselves to prove to the
Executive Committee their interest,
for the coming concert will be a
large factor in that committees' de
cision, ■—Marion Hewlett, '33
