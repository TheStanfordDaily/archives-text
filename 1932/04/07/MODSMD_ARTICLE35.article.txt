ARSENE LUPIN—At the Stanford
Theatre.
"Arsene Lupin" would be a note
i worthy film, if for no other reason
(than that it combines the talents of
! those two talented members of the
'Royal Family—John and Lionel
j Barrymore. The brothers Barrymore
'are adequately aided by a clever
i plot, interesting dialogue, and a
| surrounding cast headed by Karen
, Morley. Their roles are perfectly
! balanced, and in direct contrast.
Lionel is Guerchard, head of the
Paris secret police; John is Arsene
Lupin, the very clever thief whom
Guerchard has been seeking for
months.
' The action opens with a good epi
! sode, and the high plane of the ac
j tion is maintained pretty consist -
I ently throughout the film. There is
l one episode, the one in which Karen
Morley first appears, which may get
; audible comment from a certain
I portion of the audience (not men
tioning any names). The conclusion
! is particularly involved, and you
may begin to wonder just what the
score really is; but it finally re
solves itself into a good finish, with
. a good last line from brother John.
Needless to say, the performances
j of the two leads are almost flaw
, less; Lionel is called upon for more
! acting, and John has ample oppor
: tunity for the suavity of which he
! is master. Karen Morley, in the face
of this competition, gives a charm
ing performance; her voice im
; presses as the best among the
I younger players. —E.C.
THE GREEK—By Tiffany Thayer.
New York, 1931. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
j A novel book, though hard to

characterize it as a novel, is an easily |
applied adjective to Tiffany Thay
i it's latest story. Those who have!
| read his "Thirteen Men" will find 1
; that he has reverted to the style of i
J that book.
J The audacity and daring of this i
book is stupendous. Perhaps there j
| are some parts which the more staid
; portion of this reading world would j
j prefer omitted, yet they form the j
i cleverest parts of the story, and cer- j
• tainly give biting commentaries on
j human action.
The story, briefly put, is that of j
| Tiffany Thayer, young author, and j
1 his wife, Tertia, who meet the
i Greek, Paros. Paros is the real king
! of Greece, which prevents his mar
-1 riage to Tertia after she divorces
i Tiffany. Greece's conquering of
i America, thus enabling Paros to
! make Tertia his Empress, and the
j appointment of Tiffany as attorney
j general of the Empire are hard to
! believe, but the subsequent reforms
' are a very subtle method of poking
■ fun at our present-day conditions.
' Though radical, such methods as
j turning all criminals over to physi
| cians for vivisection and experi-
I mental purposes and prohibiting the
' sale of books except in book speak
; easies are certainly effective.
Humor forms the entire keynote
J of the book, but it is cleverly dis
| guised humor. Written in the first
1 person, one feels that Thayer has
| given rein to his feelings, and has
i had more fun in writing the story
than he has experienced for a long
time. He appears to be a keen
. psychologist, and knows his human
nature well. That he also knows
his women well is obvious, but it is
a woman—Paros' second wife—who
J proves his downfall.

And, believe it or not, there is
j very little love in the book, and a
j total absence of romantic love!

; EVENSONG—By Beverley Nichols.
1 $2.50. Doubleday Doran. (Al the
? Palo Alto Bookshop.)
i A story woven about an aging
j opera diva has been stock stuff with
! popular novelists for a long while.
"Evensong" is neither worse nor
j better than the vast majority of
j them.
Beverly Nichols has a good eye for
I the dramatic, and by the inspired
use of a great deal of technical
I knowledge about music in general,
has written a novel that does fix
j the attention in spite of an insipid
I plot. The problem is completely pre-
I sented before the middle chapter,
! and all the rest is so much space
! filler.
j "Evensong" deals with the life of
• I a pretty, tactful, unselfish, romantic,
j unreal, young thing, who somehow
j or other falls in love with a very
, j handsome young man that she sees
, at a distance for about two minutes
on a railroad platform. The rest of
• the book tells how her aunt, the
L i great Irela, attempts to come be
i: tween them. London and Paris is
i| the locale. —J.H.F.
