### 
TOMORROW S MEET

SATURDAY'S MEET
Stanford vs. California
California Courts, 2 o'clock
Closely following the announce- I
ment tfuit Keith Gledhill, Stanford j
tennis star, will be lost to the team i
for the next three weeks, is the !
news that the California meet,
scheduled for April 23, has been !
changed to Saturday and Jack Cos- i
grove, No. 3 man will be out for I
the rest of the season. The doctor !
has placed a ban on his playing j
because of a kidney ailment.
Instead of being almost certain I
conference champions, the Indian '
team, since the above developments, J
has been relegated to the position of |
having an outside chance for a tie !
with U.C.L.A.
Coughlin Moved Up
Coach Sherman Lock wood has j
moved Joe Coughlin up to No. 1 j
position in Glcdhill's place, but has j
not definitely decided what the or
der of play will be for the rest of ]
the team. It is probable that Dan |
Ellis and John Gordon will fill the j
fifth and sixth positions and the j
other players will move up two!
places.
Gordon has been playing with i
Coughlin in the first doubles team. I
The other doubles combinations will j
be the same as before with Forbes j
find Weesner on the second team i
and Otis and Ellis on the third.
Bears Strong
California has already been beaten j
by U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., but both j
meets were decided by a single \
match. The Bears are especially j
.strong in doubles, having taken all
three matches from the powerful
U.C.L.A. team.
Although California has no out- j
standing players, they have a well- j
balanced team which includes Cap- >
tain Gerry Hyde, Ted Ludlow, Carl !
Homes, Ted Gruhler, Melvin Whit- !
tnan, Ben Neiden, George Cammas, j
and Leslie Thompson. They are fa- j
voreu to take the weakened Indians 1
by a close score.
