WHEN THE Matsonia steamed |
through the Golden Gate yesterday
afternoon, one Keith Gledhill was
among the passengers. But it was
not as simple as all that. Any or- |
dinary man would have been left '
on the dock, if, indeed, he reached ;
the dock at all.
For Gledhill almost changed his
mind one time too many. Up to 12 '
o'clock Tuesday night he was de
termined to go to Honolulu to com- i
pete in the Mid-Pacific Champion
ships. He had purchased his ticket, ,
he had packed his toothbrush, an
extra shirt, and his trusty racquets, ;
and he had attended a play in San
Francisco by way of last-minute
celebration.
After encountering Coach Lock
wood at the St. Francis Hotel, Keith
changed his mind, deciding to re
main here for important matches to
be played in the next two weeks.

YESTERDAY MORNING (he
Indian tennis captain did some
figuring. Not knowing that Jack
Cosgrove would he unable to
compete for the rest of the sea
son. he came to the conclusion
that the worst that could hap
pen would he for Stanford to
end up in a tie with U.C.L.A.—
and he would he hack in time
for the playoff.
At 11 o'clock Gledhill con-

J ferred with A1 Masters. At 11:15
he decided to go to Honolulu.
At 11:20 lie was aboard the
"light automobile of popular
make" of Fred Tebhetts, with
Tebbetts at the wheel. At 12
o'clock the steamer Matsonia
left the dock in San Francisco.
Gledhill was aboard.
WHAT DOES Coach John Bunn
think of the new basketball rule,
' which was designed to eliminate
stalling? At first he considered the
i action of the coaches' association a
little drastic—constructive but dras
! tic.
Then he found out how long 10
seconds really is, and now would
J not change a single provision of the
rule if he could. Experimenting in
practice during the last two days,
Bunn found that ONLY FIVE sec
onds are consumed by the offensive
team in advancing the ball past the
center of the floor under normal
conditions. Ten are allowed by the
rule—ample time for a team which
1 wants to play real basketball.
The Indian coach was enthusiastic
about the provision which allows the
offense to return the ball back of
the center line but once. While this
| will have the effect of cutting the
playing floor in half, it will guaran
tee greater speed.
There will be thrills aplenty next
I basketball season! —L.M.C.
