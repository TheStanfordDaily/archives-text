# "A" SQUAD SUPREMACY TO BE DECIDED IN RED-WHITE POLO MATCH TOMORROW
## 
### BILL MYERS 
! Polo fans are promised one of the j
: best matches seen at Stanford this
j season when the Reds and Whites j
j of the "A" squad clash tomorrow i
afternoon on the Highway field.
The game will be an attempt to j
! settle for all time which of these t
| two outfits is the better team. Both i
quartets are about equal in strength 1
' and the match will be a bitterly j
j fought one to the final gong.
| On the Reds, Parker Holt will j
play at number one and Loyal |
Crawford at two. At the back posi
; tions will be Pete Lewis and Bruce j
i Fleming, captain of the varsity. Both '
( these men are hard-riding players /
' and pack a big wallop in their shots, j
' The White forwards will find it
J tough to score through this defense. I

Sporting the white shirts will be
a team that makes up with a little
smoother teamwork their lack of
individual stars like Fleming and
Lewis. Pete Gillham and Rufus
Spalding will play at the forward
positions, while Woody Melone and
Ed Boyles will take care of the de
fense.
Odds favor the Whites slightly.
With the Lev/is-Fleming defense to
crack, though, not more than a one
or two-goal margin is conceded
them.
The match will be run off as a
regular six-chukker intercollegiate
tilt. Play begins at 3 o'clock on
the Highway field. Admission is free.
