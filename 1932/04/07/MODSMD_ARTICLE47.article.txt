# INDIAN NINE GIVEN EQUAL GRANGE IN NEXT BEAR GAME
## Trojans Will Meet Gaels In Their Last Game Of Present Series 
### Bob Wade 
With California, Southern Cali- ;
fornia, and U.C.L.A. all battling for j
the crown which the Indians have j
held all year, Stanford takes on the j
Golden Bears Saturday in the sec- j
ond game of the annual three-game |
baseball series.
Although out of the running for ;
the flag, Stanford is conceded a I
good chance to give the invaders a
trimming. The Cards have played j
only one or two games this year ;
that shov/ed the power and speed of j
which they are capable, and if they i
should click Saturday California will j
probably chalk up another on the j
red side of the ledger.
Last Game
At the same time, the league- i
leading Trojans will be meeting St. \
Mary's invading Gaels in the third \
and last game of their series. The
Moragans gave the Barry men one
of the two defeats handed them on
their recent northern campaign.
Joe Noonan defeated U.C.L.A. in !
the first game Tuesday, and will be |
ready to pitch again either Friday !
or Saturday. The Gaels also have j
Tressidor, and McKay, who won the i
first game with el Trojan.
Anderson to Start
Coach Wolter will start Stan An- |
derson on the mound Saturday, and '
the Bears will find that the sopho- |
more is no pushover. About the only |
team that has been able to beat him j
i.s U.S.C., and it barely eked out a j
4-3 decision last week-end.
Wolter is still undecided about his j
first-sacker, and will probably start
Triplett on short again unless Del- \
mas gets over his injury. Consider
ing the amount of varsity experi- |
ence that Triplett has had, he has I
turned in pretty fair performances, j
