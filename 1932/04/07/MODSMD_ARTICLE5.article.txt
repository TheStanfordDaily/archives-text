# BARITONE SINGS ON WEDNESDAY
## John Charles Thomas Gives Last A.S.S.U. Concert 
### 
John Charles Thomas, one of j
America's leading baritones, who j
was well-received in his recent per- I
formance in San Francisco and I
forced to give numerous encores, j
will sing in the Pavilion next Wed- \
ncsday night at 8:20 o'clock in the
last of the A.S.S.U. Concert Scries |
program. The large audience which ;
applauded him in San Francisco was j
a contrast to the two people who
heard him in his first concert ap- i
pearance in that city several years |
ago.
Thomas is now one of the most j
popular baritones before the public. !
His career in grand opera began in I
Europeâ€”first at the Royal Opera j
House in Brussels, where he still j
returns each summer, and later at ;
Covent Garden in London, and at i
Berlin and Vienna.
He has become so popular as lead
ing baritone of the Royal Opera j
House in Brussels, that he has won j
the unofficial title of our "singing j
ambassador to Belgium" and is said j
to have had no small share in weld- ;
ing together the bonds of friendship
between Belgium and America.
Last season Thomas made his first
appearance with the Chicago Civic
Opera Company, and was immedi
ately re-engaged to appear exten
sively with this company during the
present season.
His first performance in the United
States as a grand opera singer was
in Washington on the eve of Presi- I
dent Coolidge's inauguration. Since, 1
he has appeared with the leading
opera companies of the country.
Tickets for the concert in the Pa
vilion next Wednesday are on sale
at the Concert Series office in the
Old Union. Prices are $2, $1.50, and
$1.
