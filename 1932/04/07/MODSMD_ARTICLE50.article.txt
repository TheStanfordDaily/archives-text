# BABE NINE FIGHTS FOR NEW U.C. WIN
## Defeat Last Week Makes Saturday Decisive 
### 
•
Whether or not the Stanford frosh j
ball club enjoys an extra seasonal
game is the question to be decided j
Saturday morning when the year- j
lings play the University of Cali- i
fornia frosh nine in the second game j
of the Little Big Series on the old •
varsity diamond.
Since the freshmen from the |
Farm were nosed out by a ten- !
inning, 7-6 score game with the
v ?>ears last Saturday, the winning of
the coming game is necessary if the
frosh intend to play a third game in
the series. If the California outfit
can pull another victory, the Baby |
Redskins will have to be content j
with their diamond season ending I
Saturday.
The great difficulty in the game '
with the Beaxs last Saturday lay in ;
the inability of the frosh to earn j
soft hits. With Gallison pitching for !
the frosh the yearlings chalked up j
only four hits with forty-one men j
batting. If Jack Gilbert, the sensa- |
tional hurler, is on the mound, as |
circumstances indicate that he will j
be, the frosh will have little chance j
of raising their individual batting i
averages.
Yesterday's practice placed the j
chances of a Stanford win, though, i
in a more brilliant perspective. !
Gordy Mallatratt, hard-hitting first- 1
baseman, who didn't fare so well in
the California game, peppered the
outfield with his long drives. On i
one occasion Mallatratt clouted a j
pitched ball clear over the outfield i
fence.
