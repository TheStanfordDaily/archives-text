# FROSH TRACKMEN FAVORED TO WIN MEET TOMORROW
## Axe Yearlings To Face San Mateo Junior College In Fourth Meet 
### 
I I
Like Peggy Hopkins Joyce and |
the University of San Francisco (not J
to mention Stanford) baseball team, |
both having suffered repeated drub
bings of discomfiture, Bill Elling
ton's freshman trackmen, sadder but
i no wiser, are bubbling over with j
[ confidence concerning their chances ]
; of registering a victory after three |
' futile attempts, when they face the i
I San Mateo Junior College Bulldogs!
i tomorrow in their fourth meet of !
the year. In fact the yearling run-
S ners only leave their pitying antics
! long enough during practice ses-
I sions to wonder where they are
! going to get any competition in to
; morrow's meet.
; Reverting to the good old dope j
I sheet (backs of syllabi) we find that
! the confidence of the '35 runners,
I and jumpers, and weight-throwers
I is not entirely unjustified, because
, San Mateo seems to have a team
|of average, or even rather below
; average, high-school performers.
' Tomorrow's meet will find the In-
I diaris presenting a somewhat revised
, entry list:

! ram, Anderson
Williams in the sprints, Brown in
j the SBO, and Bromwell in the mile,
j appear to be the only San Mateans
I with chances of winning in the track
I events tomorrow, while the Bulldog
| field performers are little better.
P.S.: A Stanford victory is pre
i dieted!
