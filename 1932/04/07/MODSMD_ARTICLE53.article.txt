# Card Mermen Ready For Southern Meet
## Stanford Varsity Swimming And Polo Team Are Only Squads That U.S.C. Has Never Beaten 
### 
T» HE only team Chat has never been beaten by U.C.C.
Wbat's this? Impossible! No, it is the Stanford varsity swimming
• team and the Stanford varsity water polo team. No other outfit can boast
i of such a record.
This year's minor sports carnival at Los Angeles on the 15th and lfilli
I should see the Cardinals overwhelm all competitors, including U.S.C., in

the swimming department. As for
water polo, however, the Trojans
have given local teams too much of
a close shave to be counted as
passive resistance this year.
Even without Ted Wiget, who is
not registered in school this quar
ter, the water polo team, with Gor
don Graves in Wiget's place, and
with one of the best goal guards on
the coast in the person of Burke
Knapp, playing, should make the
usual strong bid for honors.
Diving is the only event in which
the Indians will not be represented,
due to the absence of Herb Marsh
and Bob Wardwell. Practically all
other events of the regular meet
schedule will be ably handled by
splashers of such caliber as John
McKelvey, Tuppy Gardner, Austin
Clapp, Frank Booth, Bob Clark,
Gordy Graves, and Fred Tebbetts.
