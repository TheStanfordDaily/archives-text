# CANOES LOSE PADDLES Depression Hits Roble Club KISS REWARDS RETURN
## 
### 
Lost, strayed, or stolen—seven ca- I
| noe paddles. Will finder please re- j
! turn to Roble Club and receive suit- i
i able reward? I
What a predicament! Roble Club |
j had no sooner bought five new ca- I
I noes than seven of the ten paddles !
| disappeared, and now, unless the;
j Roble inmates are able to propel ■
I their crafts by hand, those canoes
: are going to waste.
After all, what good is a canoe i
; without a paddle?
I Roble's" nearness to Lagunita j
j makes the situation doubly hard. If \
I they were not so close perhaps j
I temptation would not arise, but
' when a glance out of any second- .
| story window reveals the lake bask- j
| ing in the sun, then it is hard to !
j content one's self with the two al- ;
' ternatives of enjoying this weather !
, —basking on the sunporch, or go- J
ing swimming in the icy waters of
| Lagunita.
If anyone has seen seven paddles,
, five paddles with red streaks across
I them, and two unmarked, take them
I back immediately to Roble, and re- i
I ceive the reward—a kiss from ev
jery girl!
