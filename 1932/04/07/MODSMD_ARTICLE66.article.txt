# UNINVITED ROBLE GUEST PERTURBS UNWILLING HOSTS
## 
### 
A piercing call for assistance
caused several Roble girls to a
certain room in 3b corridor,
where they found a male in
truder. He was kept there for
some time waiting for authori
ties to decide upon his fate. He
seemed considerably agitated
over his confinement, and ap
peared to be looking for a
means of escape.
Though he would say nothing
in his own behalf it was finally
agreed that he should be put
on probation. The paper was
removed from his hole, and he
squeezed thankfully out of
sight and (we hope) out of the
lives of the inhabitants of 3b
corridor. It is believed that his
name was Mickey.
