# Blaze Destroys State Penitentiary Factory
## 
### 
COLUMBIA, S.C., April 6.
A spectacular blaze destroyed the
chair factory of South Carolina's
state penitentiary and several other
small buildings today, but after a
stubborn fight it was brought under
control.
Several prisoners were injured,
but none escaped. There was little
disorder.
