Whether inspired by past stork
successes in the Daily, or whether
afflicted by delusions of paternal
grandeur, the Stanford rough paid
spring tribute to Roble by a stork
statue of heroic proportions which
graced the Bastille lawn this morn

Instead, a wave of pity for the
fast-vanishing rough swept through
Roble hearts that Stanford males
should be driven to such extremes
to show their desire for domesticity.
Roble authorities, apparently lack
ing the assurance of residents of
the hall, made haste to remove the
symbolic bird.
