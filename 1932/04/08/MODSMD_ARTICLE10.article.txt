# THOMAS FORSAKES MEDICO HEADACHES FOR STAGE CAREER
## 
### 
John Charles Thomas, well-known
American baritone, who will sing in
the Pavilion Wednesday night at
8:20 o'clock, at first intended to be a
doctor rather than an opera star.
He was a student in the Baltimore
Medical School when he unexpect
edly won a scholarship for the Pea
body Conservatory of Music in that
city. Letting a coin decide the is
sue, he chose the field of music, and
gave up his medical studies.
It was at the Royal Opera House
in Brussels thilt John Charles
Thomas made his operetic debut.
His entrance into opera was by
chance and unexpected, and it took
him three months to decide whether
to sign the offered contract, or ad
here strictly to concert work, which
he prefers.
Tickets for the concert which
Thomas will give on the campus
Wednesday night are on sale at the
Concert Serie s office in the Old Un
ion. Prices are $2, $1.50 and $1.
