# 'Madame X' Entered In Race For Queen By 'Campus Lover'
## One Thousand Votes To Be Given By "Date-'em-all" To Person Who Discovers Mystery Woman; "Montana Moon" Still Leads Race 
### 
IS MADAME X?
! To the person who can answer that question correctly before the polls j
close on Wednesday, Filipi (Date-eni-all) Humphreys will give 1000 free
votes. Pictured in these columns, Madame .... Mademoiselle to be

specific .... X is the running mate picked by prospec- ;
tive king "Campus Lover" Humphreys to share the
throne with him in case of eventualities.
"She is a campus date,'' declared Humphreys, "very
popular and prominent in several activities. I con
gratulate myself on being permitted to escort a person
so alluringly attractive and appropriately Stanford's
own."
"Montana Moon" Prelsnik, the Chuckling Pretzel, was
leading the race last night with a total of 947 votes, a
fact that proves the statement that the Pi Phi's are i
backing "Spcedball" (Howdy) Hewlett to the limit for

the queenship. Indecision marked the Taylor-Judd situation as that
couple ran a close second with (575 tallies. Taylor is said to have denied
his candidacy and to have followed this immediately with several denials j
of these contradictions. A pool formed on the Mills campus is said to

be back of the movement. The •
Humphreys-X combination wavered '
between the first three places on the j
list to rest finally in third with 510 j
counts yesterday.
Ricciardi Threatens
"Heaven-Eyes" Ricciardi with her i
ape-man 'Panzee Targhetta were j
threatening seriously to the point of |
451 pennies as the polls closed. 1
These soul-mates are purported to j
be splitting the Roble vote with the [
famous Redhead-Yaple outfit, now j
back in seventh position with 160
votes.
Other candidates still in the run
ning arc: Larry "Roble" Mason, 215; ,
Milton "Wandering" Hand, 190; Mort
(The Blush Man) Fuller, 125; Phil j
"Adonis" Gamier, 260; Bob Brown, :

art with "Two Bit Tillio," 55; Thad "I !
Never Touch It" McNamara, 50; ,
John "Do-Or-Die" Devel with j
"Highest Bidder," 27; Oscar "True j
Love" Maddaus with Mary Smith
from parts unknown, 25.

A.S.S.U. offices at the low price of i

Entered at High Pitch
Interest is at a high pitch on the J
Row and in Roble in a serious at- ,
tempt to "Keep the Queen on the
Farm," which is the first slogan of I
the "$5OO. Several factions have 1
been formed to back Stanford can- j
didates, but as yet only the Prelsnik- j
Hewlett combination has been able
to beat the invading team from j
Mills.
Sequoia, regarded as the strong- >
hold of the Rough, and Mills, ac- !
knowledged as the largest com
petitor of the local "500," have en
tered into the affair with a zest, de
termined to (in the words of Art
Miller, Taylor's campaign manager)
"put the Stanford women in their j
proper place for all time!!!"

the queenship. Indecision marked the Taylor-Judd situation as that

his candidacy and to have followed this immediately with several denials j
