# WET ENDING OF DREAM RESULTS IN SELF-RESCUE
## 
### 
Without even having to count
sheep, Paul de Silva, promi
nent campus swimmer, fell
asleep yesterday afternoon.
Which was quite natural,
considering the lazily drifting
canoe he occupied, the hot sun,
the quiet water, and the peace
ful surroundings in the middle
of Lagunita, but somewhat un
complimentary to the textbook
he had been studying.
De Silva can dream, as well
as sleep and swim .... he was
diving .... down, down under
the surface of the water . . . .
he was far ahead .... the
stands were in an uproar . . . .
he breasted his way through
the deep, cold water .... cold,
cold water . . . !
Yes, the water WAS cold,
and Stanford's husky merman
ivas forced to swim for his life
when he awakened under an
overturned canoe which was no
dream.
The rescue of Paul de Silva,
sleeper and dreamer, was ef
ficiently executed by Paul de
Silva, swimmer and life-saver.
