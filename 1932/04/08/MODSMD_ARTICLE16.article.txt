"I wish I had an ocean of Rum, |
Of Sugar a Thousand Pounds—" ]
—Old Menlo Folk Song.
The ancient controversy regarding ,
the manliness of Stanford men is one i
step nearer solution today, as the j
result of a strong argument un- j
earthed indicating that the Rough ;
is a rough Rough.
Three glasses of milk, a whole |
French bread, a dozen pancakes—
this is nothing to the male Cardinal
when he sits down to a meal in one j
of the dining halls, it was stated by !
Miss Christine Ricker, Stanford Food ,
Director.
"A universally favorite Roble j
luncheon consists of soup, salad, and
fruit," said Miss Ricker. "but if that
same meal were to be placed on En- '
cilia's tables, there would certainly i

| be an uproar. Encina gets as many
! fruits and vegetables as Roble, yet
| they also receive a great deal more
( bread, and a meal without potatoes
I is not a meal to them!"
j Liver and bacon is much favored
| by Stanford's stronger (in numbers,
, anyway) sex, and meat pies are also
I in demand. At Roble, the luncheons
| are arranged so that the women can
I eat a salad or fruit, or choose in
stead an entree and sweet. At En
j cina, no such division is necessary,
i They eat it all: what they can't have
j in quality, they take in quantity.
Both halls have diet tables. Roble
| inmates are afraid of overeating, but
j such an idea never enters the heads
!of the men. Roble has a table for
overweights, but Encina has one for
i underweights!
