# WAIT TIP FROM GANG HEADS IN EAGLET RESCUE
## Lindbergh Butler Leaves House, Alarms Press Gets Haircut 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., April 7.â€”As
far as could be learned today, Col
onel Charles A. Lindbergh has tem
porarily abandoned the air excur
sions which took him over Martha's
Vineyard twice on two successive
days this week to contact the kid
napers of his son.
He has not been seen outside the
estate since his return from the
second sortie early Tuesday morning.
An automobile which left the
estate about 1 a.m. today with what
appeared to be two troopers and a
civilian gave rise to a report that
Colonel Lindbergh and Colonel Sch
warzkopf had left together "on an
important mission."
Refuses Lindy Comment
Schwarzkopf, however, in his aft
ernoon bulletin, said he had not left
the estate all day. He did not men
tion Colonel Lindbergh, but he had
already announced that he would
not attempt to give out information
on the movements of any members
of the family.
Ollie Whately, the Lindbergh but
ler, had been seen leaving the estate
in an automobile in custody of de
tectives. In response to questions
of excited reporters, Schwarzkopf
tersely announced:
"Whately is getting a hair cut."
Talks of Purple Gang
Once more the State Police Super
intendent directed attention to the
search for Harry Fleisher, the De
troit purple gangster and his New
York aid, Abie Wagner.
"Peculiar circumstances surround
ing their disappearance," he said,
"as well as reports that they have
been seen under suspicious circum
stances since the kidnaping, make it
important to the investigation that
they be located and questioned."
In some quarters the hue and cry
for these two racketeers has been
regarded as merely another attempt
to divert attention from the real
activities in the negotiations.
