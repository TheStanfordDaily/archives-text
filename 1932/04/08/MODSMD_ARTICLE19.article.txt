# Undefeated Tennis Babes Meet Bears
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman tennis team
will face the California yearlings at
.10:30 o'clock tomorrow morning in
its toughest meet of the season. The
Indians have been undefeated to
date, but are conceded slightly less
than an even chance against the
strong squad of the Baby Bears.
Although both teams have de
feated Lowell High by close scores,
California is reported not to have
used its strongest men against the
high-school players.
The men taking the trip to Berke
ley are: Captain Sam Lee, Bob
Lilienthal, Don Dana, John Huston,
Hugh Moran, Herman Dreyer, Bob
Ransom, Rowland Gray, and Jim
Mullen.
