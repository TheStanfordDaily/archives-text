# 'Fraud' Wail Of Eastern Scribe Over Ben's Mark
## Eastman Starter, Timers Attacked By "Expert" 
### 
"Even if it were true we wouldn't !
believe it."
This old familiar attitude of the
East toward things athletic in the j
West is already being shown con- j
cerning the phenomenal quarter- j
mile record set by Ben Eastman
two weeks ago.
Each year Western football teams j
wipe up the gridirons of the country
with the best the East has to offer.
Each year Western track and field
teams triumph in the I.C.A.A.A.A. j
meet. Each year—but why go on?
Affront, Says Writer
Always the East raises the hue j
and cry of "fake," "fluke," or j
"fraud." The following are excerpts j
from a blast by Henry W. Clune,!
track "expert" of the Rochester, ,
N.Y., Democrat and Chronicle, which j
was .sent Dink Templelon by an i
Eastern track fan:
"A lot of people with a sense of j
perspective in things of this nature j
are probably asking today, who held ;
the watches when Ben Eastman, j
crack Stanford middle distance run- j
ner, was credited v/ith 46.4 seconds I
for 440 yards in that track meet in
Palo Alto Staturday? Because, of
all the amazing claims that have j
been made for Coast athletes, this ,
claim for Eastman is in many ways |
the most amazing; the greatest af- j
front, if you will, to the intelli- •
gence of the country's track and .
field enthusiasts.
"Sublime to Ridiculous"
"We must admit, to be sure, that
the track and field performers on !
the Coast during the past six or |
eight years have shown some very
fine legitimate performances. Their
sprinters have generally outrun our
Eastern critics. But 46 2-5 seconds
for a quarter mile! That is getting
out of the realm of the sublime, into 1
the ridiculous. From the figures re- I
turned on Eastman's race Saturday
we suspect that both the starter and I
the timers were very liberal with ;
him; both giving him, say, five yards !
each. Or perhaps the timers used |
the town clock instead of stop j
watches."
"Even if it were true we wouldn't !
believe it."
