# Eastman Plans 880 Record Try Here Tomorrow
## Cards May Upset Dope To Defeat Winged "O," Dons In Triangular Meet On Old Oval; Captain Alvin Hables To Run 440, Brother Les Out 
### DICK STROUSE 
YV HEN Bon Eastman, Bob Kleckner, Henry Coggeshall. and their respec
tive ambitious and industrious teammates gel through throwing can
non balls, sawdust, and cinders at each other tomorrow afternoon, a new
world's half-mile record and an Olympic Club track victory may be
entered into the books. Eastman, providing the wind and his digestive
faculties are in good shape, will be the new record-holder, and Charlie
Hunter's Post Strecters, providing certain Stanford Indians don't up and
get too ornery, will be the winners in the Olympic-Stanford-S.F.U. meet.

â€¢ Long, lean, loping Ben will try
Ito take the 880-yurd mark for a
j merry ride at exactly 3:10 o'clock,
j according to a statement issued by
| Don Liebendorfer yesterday. Lie
| bendorfer has arranged for wind
i machines, official timers, and tested
: stop-watches 1o insure the proper
i conditions for Eastman's effort.
Cards Can Cop
In spite of the invaluable opinions
! of infallible track experts, Stanford
j has a chance in tomorrow's battle of
| brawn and speed. The Indians de
. feated the Olympic Club in an early
j season dual meet even though East
| man was getting his workout in the
j stands, but il is feared that the vic
! Tory will not be repeated tomorrow
i because of the absence of Leslie
! Hables and the presence of certain
j members of the S.F.U. squad.
Falph Giberson and Frank Lom-
I bardi may be the boys to upset the
dope, Montague of the Dons, and
I Stith and Sparks of the Club. Gibey
; will be hard to beat in the century
and he and Lombardi are still very
much in the furlong.
Revengeful Broad-jumpers
Bill Werder and Wally Butler are
I two more who may add unexpected
points to the cause of Dink Temple
; ton, the 8.A.C., and Herb Hoover,
i Werder and Butler let their former
j teammates, West, Dowell, and Dyer
) shut them out in the previous
j Olympic Club meet, but hope to get
I a couple of places tomorrow in the
I broad-jump.
I Ned Johns, who won the pole
| vault in the earlier affair at 13 feet,
j will have some help from Bert De
, Groot this time. Jim Ferric may
J surprise Harry Carter in the mile
! and cop the four-lap race.
Captain Hahlcs to Run
Captain Alvin Hables will make
i his first official appearance of the
f current season, probably in the re
j lay. If Hables doesn't, run the quar
j ter, Cards Nash, Guittard, and
j Murphy will try and outfoot Jack
, Waltz of the Club.
Stanford's 1931 captain, Podge
Smith, may find the younger genera
tion a bit too speedy for him if Gus
Meier keeps up his winning ways in
the hurdles. Brugman of the Cards
! and Raster of the Club in the highs
and the improving Cotto Herbert
and Clubman Stith in the lows will
i add interest.
Amdahl May Surprise
Sophomore Ollie Amdahl may
surprise Ralph Hill and Gcricke,
' who both beat him last time, in the
I two-mile. Art Azevedo expects to
j knock ten scconds or so from his
j best time and garner a point or
| maybe three or five.
There will be four places in every
| event on the program that starts at
i 2:30. If the affair is decided by the
! relay, Stanford's latest quartet of
i Ike Hables, Lombardi. Ben Eastman,
; and either Nash or Don Blackman
j should bring the bacon home to the
| Farm where it belongs.
