Tlu* fate of the fraternities slill remains in doubt as the
Interfraternity Hoard of Control sat through four hours
of discussion Wednesday night without reaching a de
cision.
At the last meeting of the Interfraternity Council a num
ber of resolutions were passed, making pertinent changes
in Mte rushing rules in an effort to make the present system !
workable. II was hoped that in view of these alterations,
and :i realization of the fraternities of the seriousness of I
the present situation and the necessity for preventing a
reoccurrence, Ihe Hoard would rescind its penally postpon
ing rushing until next fall.
This penally, if carried out, will have many undesirable!
consequences that were not, perhaps, foreseen when the
punishment was passed. Man\ houses will suffer seriously
from the financial loss which will result if no classes are
pledged this spring. Such a loss will do unmerited harm
and during these times of depression careful consideration
of the monetary results of this penalty is advisable. And,!
too, there is the ever present housing problem which will
be even greater next fall when one hundred additional
freshmen will be admitted.
The penalty as it now stands pleases no one and its
consequences will be harmful far above any benefits that
could be derived from it. If the Hoard feels that some
punishment is absolutely necessary, an alternative should I
be worked out.
However, with the new altitude of the fraternities
toward the whole rushing problem and their determined
efforts to put rushing on a satisfactory and workable basis,
wiping the whole mess ofl' the books and starting out with
a clean slate under a new set of rules would be a mag
nanimous gesture on the part of the Hoard. The apprecia
tion of this act by the fraternities would work toward a
better spirit and they, in the long run, with a new plan of
rushing, would prove themselves worthy of this confidence
of the Hoard.
