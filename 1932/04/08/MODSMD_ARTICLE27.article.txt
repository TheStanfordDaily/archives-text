# EFFICIENT APPEAL-PROMPT RESPONSE
## 
### 
It whs just a month ago lhat Acting-President Robert E. j
Swain appointed the Stndcnts' Emergency Enii)loyment i
Fund Committee. Today it has in its coffers more than!
*1200. It lnis created work for 10 Stanford men.
Acting with decision at :i time when it was most needed, I
Swain appointed a committee whose vigor equaled his own. j
As a result of its speedy and efficient appeal, within a week
of its appointment a goodly number of plans were under
way for relieving financially distressed students who had 1
already squeezed the last penny from all existing loan '
funds.
The response on the campus was as prompt and ade
quate as the action of those making the appeal. To the j
women especially, students benefitting from the plan arc j
indebted. Only two men's organizations, Sequoia and En- |
cilia clubs, have given a red cent for the cause. On the other
hand, file Mother's Club, the Faculty Women's Club, and j
W.A.A. have contributed substantial amounts raised largely
through strenuous effort expended in putting on benefit j
shows, teas, etc. And of the smaller contributions, the ina-l
jority have come from women.
If one realizes that the number of financially strained |
women here is infinitsimal when compared to the number
of men in said condition, the response of the women be-j
t wines even more noteworthy. However, perhaps it is the
very fact that so many men are suffering from the "Empty j
Pocket" malady that precludes their donating.
Rut the drive goes on. There is no question about the j
worthiness of the cause. Anyone with eyes to look about
c;m see it. Then how about sharing the burden each per
son to his capacity, whether man, woman, or child.
