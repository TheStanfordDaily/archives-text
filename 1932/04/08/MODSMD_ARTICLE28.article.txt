# UNNECESSARILY DRASTIC ACTION
## 
### 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, prosi<lent of Columbia I ni
versity, lias stirred up a hornets' nest of critics toy his recent
action expelling Heed Harris, editor ol the C.olnmbia Spec
tator, whose attack on one of the campus dining halls last
week climaxed a stormy career in the editorial chair.
At this distance from the scene of action The Daily
cannot pass on the justification for Harris' latest outburst,
lie niiiv have been entirely in the wrong. But, nevertheless,
Dr. Butler and Dean Herbert llawkcs appear to have been
more drastic in their measures than the situation war
ranted. The fair name of the university could not be ser
iously affected by the criticisms of (lining hall manage
ment, and the authority of the administration was not ques
tioned.
Freedom of expression is essential to a college news
paper if if is to maintain the esprit de corps which pro
duces a worthwhile publication. The administrator who
checks this freedom without imperative reason is guilty
of an attack upon that liberal thought which it is the prim
ary duty of colleges to foster. Certainly it is to be hoped
that Dr. Butler has not established a precedent for future
cases of the same sort, whether at Columbia or elsewhere.
