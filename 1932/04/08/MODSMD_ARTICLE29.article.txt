# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
The orchestra is softly playing |
"Hearts and Flowers" in the back- j
ground today. The birds are singing, j
to be sure, but they cannot find it j
in their hearts to warble. The sun is j
shining after its accustomed fashion, '
but it lacks brilliance and warmth.
Even the frog-song in Lagunita is \
like a dirge, this morning, and the
, chaps up in the Chappie office have j
quit gazing out of the windows, ancfj
are trying to drown their sorrows in !
work.
Why? Because poor old Wind
jammer, Narcissus of the Quad
rangle and the Daily office,
looked once too often in flic
pool, or something, and is to be
seen no more in the flesh, at
least not for many moons,
i Charge it to the depression, or ;
what you will, in your first few j
hours of sorrow; and then come '
back, read, and understand what it's I
I all about:
On Windjammer's own private I
mahogany desk, in our own corner {
of the office, separated from the rest j
by the traditional gold hand-railing, i
we found a very official-looking |
document, yesterday afternoon, j
stamped with the university seal and :
all the rest of it. And the thing
reads like this:
Whereas Alias Q. Windjammer
has proven himself a total loss of I
j adding to the general welfare of'
the community;
Whereas the same A.Q.W. has con- j
I stituted nothing less than a public j
menace, and with snooping around ,
fraternity ash cans and the adminis
tration offices;
1 Whereas he has proven himself
positively and abjectly devoid of a
sense of humor;
The Powers of the University feel
that his services are no longer a
necessity. (Close the door as you
go out.)

So that seems to be that. Or at
least it seemed so until the dear old
Daily, in its generous entirety, came
to the rescue. The staff went into a
huddle, working its brain with cus
tomary lightning rapidity, and a
few minutes later announced a con
test of swiftness and accuracy in
answering any two of these five
questions:
1. What is a pipe course?
2. Who is Hen Eastman?
3. What campaign now on
campus is a lot of hooyee?
4. What is a college president
for?
5. Why is a Beta?
We did pretty well on the third
one, being pretty interested in Ed
Boyles and the Masque Ball. And
since no one else in the office had
time to bother with the contest
right then, Windjammer was loudly
declared to be winner.
And the prize, boys and girls (you
should try a contest like that your
selves, sometimes!) is a Trip Around
the World in Fifty Days. We made
it fifty because we want to be back
in time to pass the ice water during
finals.
Anyhoy, we're right in the
midst of packing our toothbrush
now, because we leave on Sun
day. Haven't decided yet which
way to start round the globe.
Does the Wind jam to the East
or West in April? (Pun, heh!
Get it?)
We'll be glad to answer any com
munications from campus bright
lights, during our absence. A plane
carrying extra tooth paste and
chewing gum will be in touch with
us daily.
So long, then .... We're practi
cally started on our way. Expect
first official travel-diary Monday.
S.O.S.
