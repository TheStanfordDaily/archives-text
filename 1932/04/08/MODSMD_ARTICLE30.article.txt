PICTURE BOOKS FOR GROWN-!
UFS—Palo Alto Book Shop.
"The Stag at Eve"—Collected—Far- j
rar and Rinehart, Inc., New York.
By far the best of the deluge of
picture-books for grown-ups, "The
Stag at Eve,'' is bawdy, Rabelaisian
humor from the talented drawing
pencils of New Yorkers Soglow,
Rea, Steig. Klein, etc. Clever, riot
ous, and not too subtle, this anthol
ogy of full-page and comic-strip
sketches features the typical New
Yorker jokes, but all of these have j
been dipped into sex beyond the i
| New Yorker limits. There are I
' eighty-nine pictures illustrating the i
styles of many of today's favorites. J
: The fact that James Thurber was,
not included in the book is the only j
cause for laments.
"Peter Arno's Circus" —Peter Arno. i
Horace Livcrwright, New York. !
1 Peter Arno was once very funny |
! —as the originator of the New j
j Yorker bathtub and bosom jokes, j
| but he now lacks ideas and draws
billboard advertisements. "Hulabal- J
: loo" was funny, "Parade" was fair, j
j and "Circus" is poor. Not only is j
: the quality of low grade, but the j
! book is scant of material and con- j
j tains some obvious filler. Originally
' Arno was clever. New Yorker paid
j for good ideas which it turned over
to Arno to illustrate, and therefore j
1 a good deal of his fame rested on
the ideas of other people. Either the
contributors have failed to send in
! the ideas since their lawsuit with
| Arno, or Peter is using his own
ideas. At any rate, they are terrible.
"Rejections"—Alan Dunn. Alfred A. i
Knopf. New York. 1931.
; The publishers would imply by |
j the title and cover blurbs that these !
drawings of Mr. Dunn were re
! jected because of difficulties with
1 the censor, but closer observation
| reveals the reason for rejection—
they simply are not funny! A duller
, collection of jokes could scarcely be
' found anywhere with the possible
; exception of recent issues of Bally-
I hoo. Possibly the dirt is too far be
j neath the surface, possibly the au
thor overestimates his abilities, pos
sibly the publishers are trying to put
I something over on the public—at

any rate, something is wrong.
"Vignettes of Life"—J. Norman
Lynd. The Reilly and Lee Co.,
Chicago.
Widely syndicated through the
Sunday Magazine sections, Lynd's
"Vignettes" are known and enjoyed
all over the country. Here they are
collected for the first time in book
form and should prove amusing to
the majority of readers. — 8.0.8.

THIRTEEN MEN — By Tiffany
Thayer. New York. 1930. (At the 1
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
"This is the damndest book you
ever read."
With this first sentence of "Thir- j
teen Men," it suffices to say that the i
author knew what he was talking :
about. Certainly there cannot be,
another book in print which con- i
tains such absolute frankness, such :
keen diagnosis of human character,
and such astounding fiction.
Twelve men are chosen a jury to \
try a certain murder case. The thir- J
teenth person is the criminal. Known j
as the "Phantom," he has proceeded 1
to kill people because he thought J
either that the world was better off
without them, or that they were bet
ter off outside the world. Thayer!
gives detailed portraits of the twelve
jurors, showing their entire lives.
! He does this in an excellent manner,
but fails totally in his ending, which
comes when the jury finally meets.
He attempts to show superficially
how the character of the men affects
their judgment on the prisoner, but
in contrast with the strong human
studies, it falls short of its purpose.
J An interesting book, very force
j fully written and an essentially
j modern story. —C.M.H.
