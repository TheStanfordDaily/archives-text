In the history of art Bach is the ;
link between the old and the new, i
: not exclusively a reformer, the |
originator of new forms, but rather !
' a spectator of all musical time and :
j existence; and wedded to no for- i
inula, old or new, but was attracted I
I by every utterance that rang true.
The entire program will be made
up of the following numbers:
1 Prelude and Fugue, G Minor. .Bach
