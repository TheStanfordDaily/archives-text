# BULL SESSION
## HONOR SOCIETIES 
### 
History, I believe, credits Napoleon j
with starting honor societies. Real- j
izing, as he did, that people want
anything that somebody else hasn't
got—he began distributing bits of
ribbon and metal to various indi
viduals. The Legion of Honor was a i
great success. The ego was expanded '
and re-expanded by having a sym- j
bol of worth pinned on the heaving j
bosom. But if the Little Corporal j
was the humble originator—it has |
taken American collegiate genius to !
put honor on a paying, mass-pro- '
duction basis.
Every campus now fairly reeks
with honor societies. They clog the
atmosphere and the yearbooks. They
exist in numbers uncountable and
for reasons unexplainable. Most of
them have three meetings annually
—one to elect members, another to
elect officers, and a third to decide J
to buy a full page in the "Quad." !
However, it is often possible to j
combine these purposes —and they
may have only one or two meetings I
annually. These societies collect
handsome initiation fees, and dis
tribute handsome keys or pins and i
then reassume their former lethargy.
Sometimes they fail in these simple
functions and thus pass out of ex
istence. But their place is soon re
filled—unfortunately.
Realizing, then, that honor socie
ties in general are nothing but gilt
leeches often with Greek letters
stamped on them, it was particularly

| gratifying to learn the other evening
, that one honor society in particular
was performing front line duty.
Their service was made especially
startling since other societies can't I
i even spell "uniform." The reference
i is of course to "Saber and Boots,"
! or "Rapier and Slippers," or is it
j "Sword and Sandals," for their really
] fine dramatic reading of "Private
| Lives."
Proving more entertaining than
' around here for some time, the
reading, we are promised, is to be j
only the beginning. This honorary I
dramatic society plans to do some- j
thing for the campus. They are jus
tifying their existence—not only to
themselves but to the rest of us as j
well. If the standard set in this first 1
attempt can be maintained, the so- J
ciety will have to hire some of these
1 tough B.A.C. guards to beat off the j
! mobs. Not only was the choice of i
| play excellent, but the stage setting |
and the reading of the parts were i
I delightful.
Such exuberance ill becomes a
I modern college student according to
| all the popular standards. Yet when
one thinks of all these honorary as
sociations lying in their musty
graves—coming forth yearly to elect
new members—stalking forth in this
world for a few moments —and then
returning to the silent beyond, the
i performance of "Sword and San
i dais" becomes cataclysmic-ally out
j standing. —Abe Mellinkoff

I modern college student according to
| all the popular standards. Yet when
one thinks of all these honorary as
sociations lying in their musty
graves—coming forth yearly to elect
new members—stalking forth in this
world for a few moments —and then
returning to the silent beyond, the
i performance of "Sword and San
i dais" becomes cataclysmic-ally out
j standing. —Abe Mellinkoff
History, I believe, credits Napoleon j
with starting honor societies. Real- j
izing, as he did, that people want
anything that somebody else hasn't
got—he began distributing bits of
ribbon and metal to various indi
viduals. The Legion of Honor was a i
great success. The ego was expanded '
and re-expanded by having a sym- j
bol of worth pinned on the heaving j
bosom. But if the Little Corporal j
was the humble originator—it has |
taken American collegiate genius to !
put honor on a paying, mass-pro- '
duction basis.
Every campus now fairly reeks
with honor societies. They clog the
atmosphere and the yearbooks. They
exist in numbers uncountable and
for reasons unexplainable. Most of
them have three meetings annually
—one to elect members, another to
elect officers, and a third to decide J
to buy a full page in the "Quad." !
However, it is often possible to j
combine these purposes —and they
may have only one or two meetings I
annually. These societies collect
handsome initiation fees, and dis
tribute handsome keys or pins and i
then reassume their former lethargy.
Sometimes they fail in these simple
functions and thus pass out of ex
istence. But their place is soon re
filled—unfortunately.
Realizing, then, that honor socie
ties in general are nothing but gilt
leeches often with Greek letters
stamped on them, it was particularly

| gratifying to learn the other evening
, that one honor society in particular
was performing front line duty.
Their service was made especially
startling since other societies can't I
i even spell "uniform." The reference
i is of course to "Saber and Boots,"
! or "Rapier and Slippers," or is it
j "Sword and Sandals," for their really
] fine dramatic reading of "Private
| Lives."
Proving more entertaining than
' around here for some time, the
reading, we are promised, is to be j
only the beginning. This honorary I
dramatic society plans to do some- j
thing for the campus. They are jus
tifying their existence—not only to
themselves but to the rest of us as j
well. If the standard set in this first 1
attempt can be maintained, the so- J
ciety will have to hire some of these
1 tough B.A.C. guards to beat off the j
! mobs. Not only was the choice of i
| play excellent, but the stage setting |
and the reading of the parts were i
I delightful.
Such exuberance ill becomes a
I modern college student according to
| all the popular standards. Yet when
