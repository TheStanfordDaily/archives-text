; | BARRING DISAGREEABLY colc!
, | weather or a high wind, Ben East- '
i man will be sent out after the
! world's hall'-mile record tomorrow j
i afternoon, according to an announce
i merit made by Assistant Coach Bill
' ! Ellington yesterday.
j And if he is sent after it, there are ;
few who doubt his ability to grab it.
It is not so much a question of
"can" as "how much." Dink Temple
ton has gone on record as believing j
the blond meteor can eventually get 1
under 1:50.
It all depends on that crucial third
] 220 yards. A schedule has been laid i
| out for Ben which will insure the
! cracking of the record: 52 seconds !
, for the first 440 yards, approximate
ly 28 seconds for the next 220 yards,
j and 30 seconds or less for the final
i furlong. That adds up to 1:50 —far
I under Dr. Otto Peltzer's 1:51.6 mark.
... ... ,v
OF COURSE, it is one thing to
lay out a schedule, and another
to adhere to it. Eastman has no
trouble with that first 440. He
has perfected his pace to a point
where he passes the half-way
post in comfortably less than 53 i
seconds but not so fast as to get
under 52.
The last 220 yards is no ob
stacle either. Under almost any
circumstances he can cover this
distance in the required 30 sec
onds. It is the third furlong
which causes all the trouble. It
j is the crucial point of the whole
race. Because of his relative un
. | familiarity with the /half-mile
i trek (he actually has run it only
I a comparatively few times), Ben
; has a difficult time in regulating
himself to that necessary 28-
second pace.
j In Tuesday afternoon's 880
trial, he covered the first lap on
schedule, but consumed .'53 sec
onds in the furlong following—
not because of a lack of stamina,
but because of misjudginent. I
■ j Yesterday afternoon, running
I the (i(JO. he passed the 440 mark i

in 52.8, but took 29.4 seconds to
finish in 1:22.2. He had slowed
down a trifle too much rounding
the final turn.
But if Eastman finds that 28-
second pace tomorrow, the East
will have another Western mark
to laugh off.

All of the horses who com
peted at Del Monte last week

thrilling afternoon is in store.
