# CARDINAL NINE SET TO DEFEAT BEARS IN SECOND TUSSLE
## Indians To Face California Here; Hope To Cop Big Series 
### 
With no hope for the ehampion-
I ship, which they won last year, but |
! with excellent chances of upsetting |
the Bears in the annual three-game
series, Stanford's varsity baseball j
| outfit plays host to the Berkeley ag- ;
j gregation Saturday in the second j
| game. j
Somewhat recovered from their j
| slump, and starting the squad's most I
| dependable chucker, Stanford has j
I an excellent chance of giving the !
j Bears a sound thumping.
Anderson to Start
Coach Wolter will start Anderson ;
on the mound and Ike Livermore j
: behind the plate. First base is still
j doubtful, since both Hearn and !
. Goodell can bat left-handed against I
I the right-handed slants of the Cali- I
j fornia chucker, Bill Peterson,
j Anderson has been getting better
j steadily, and if it isn't too cold when
j Saturday afternoon rolls around he
j will probably hook up in a pitcher's
! duel with Bill Peterson. However, 1
j strange things have happened to i
j both already this season, and in ad- '
I dilion the Indians are about '"due." j
Bears Win Seven
California lias hung up wins in the
| last seven games they have played.
I Half a game from the top, they are I
j hoping that St. Mary's will upset
I the Trojans on their present invasion
of the South.
Most of the California victories |
! have been on their own sandlot,,
however, and they have that short
' rightfield fence down to a science,
i It's one of those snappy fields where
j the outfielders can take excursions I
! into the stands if they can first jump
! all the pits in sight, clear a cement
| wall, and then run up the grand-!
j stand seats. Reminds one of a tea
i cup.
j There is no reason why the In-
I dians can't beat the Bears in the I
! remaining two games gf the series, i
j take U.S.F. in the other two, finish j
- with U.C.L.A., and end the season
' on the black side of the ledger.
