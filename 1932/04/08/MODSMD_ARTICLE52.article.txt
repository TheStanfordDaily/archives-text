# REDS AND WHITES WILL MEET TODAY IN POLO CONTEST
## Clash Of Two Teams From "A" Squad Promises Speedy Show 
### Willie Myers 
A long-standing dispute will be j
settled this afternoon on Ihe High- j
. way polo field. Picked teams repre- j
[ senting the Reds and Whites of the i
[ polo A squad will clash in what [
; promises to be one of the speediest j
tilts played at Stanford this year.
Captain Dick Gordon, polo mentor, |
has arranged the match, which will
be the first of a series of intra- :
squad games to be played this quar- J
ter. For many weeks the Reds and j
Whites have tangled in daily j
scrimmages. Neither team has had
much of an edge over the other, and
there has been many a bitter argu
j ment as to which was the better i
j outfit.
Whites Favored
Odds, if any, favor the Whites, j
With a better balanced team, a one
or two-goal margin might be con
ceded them. It is doubtful, however,
if this outfit will be able to do any j
heavy scoring through the defense |
of Lewis and Fleming, playing at |
; three and four for the Reds. The j
game will be a hard scrap until the j
final gong. Besides the natural ri
valry already existing between the j
two quartets, there will be an added j
fruit of victory in the form of a :
dinner in San Francisco for the win- J
ners.
Louis Stoddard, president of the '
American Polo Association, after j
; seeing the Redshirts trim the Ari- |
zona Wildcats last quarter, remarked
that Stanford has one of the hardest
riding, flashiest outfits in the coun
' try.
Card riders will be split evenly
| between the Reds and Whites. Gill
ham and Spalding will be at the
forward berths for the
while Lewis and Fleming will sport i
the crimson jerseys at the back
positions.
Play starts at 3 o'clock on the
Highway field. Admission is free.
