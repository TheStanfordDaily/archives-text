# BEAR CUB NINE TO MEET CARD BABES HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrowâ€”it's then or never.
If the Stanford frosh ball club
| doesn't defeat the Bear frosh to
| morrow morning at 10:30 o'clock on
! the old varsity diamond, the year-
I lings from the Farm will lose all
chances for drubbing the California
i team this year. If the Redskins do
j win, a return game will be held,
i Responsibility for a Stanford win
j will rest to a great extent upon the
i twirling arm of Fred Heringer,
I regular pitcher. Heringer will op
| pose a California team that has
| known few defeats and that bran
| dishes a long winning career studded
by huge-score wins. Jack Hosmer
will back up Heringer behind the
plate. Gordy Mallatratt will cover
first base, Captain Jim Woolley will
patrol the keystone bag district, A1
Semmelroth will take care of third,
and Jim Kurtz will guard the short
stop post. Out in the field the finest
i combination that Coach Cuddeback
; has been able to produce will be in
! full force. Marvy Kahn, Vin Meyer,
1 and Pat Symonds will be the trio to
comb the outfield regions.
Professor Augustus Murray's class
in New Testament C 26 will meet
jin the Little Theatre at 8 o'clock
;. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
