# Grid Puzzle May Be Solved After Next Scrimmage
## Guards And Tackles To Be Center Of Interest 
### 
How good is Pop Warner's 1932
football material?
Always a heated question at this
time of the year, this query will be
partially answered this afternoon
when the Stanford grid prospects
run through the first full scrimmage
of the season. Short scrimmages
were held on both Monday and
Wednesday of this week, but to
day's affair will shed the fii'st real
light on what the football situation
actually is.
Interest in Line
Of particular interest and under
most minute observation will be the
performances turned in by the
guards and tackles, for it is on these
positions that the success of the
team depends. There are plenty of
backs, three good ends, and a trio
of veteran at least one of
whom should develop into a first
class pivot man this year. In addi
tion, there is Bill Corbus, all coast
guard. But, so far, no outstanding
candidates for the other guard po
sition or the two tackle spots have
loomed on the horizon.
Back from last year's team will
be Red Gribben, George Grey, and
Chuck Prelsnik, tackles, and Fred
Scribner and possibly Windy Bige
low, guai'ds. All of these men are
capable performers, but have never
been outstanding. What they will
do this year is still an unanswered
question.
The guards who go under labora
tory experimentation today will be
Kite, Card, and Morgan. These men
have been playing on the first two
squads all week, but should they
fail to come through today, there
is a host of aspiring guards who
long to show what they can do.
Two Tackles
Last year's freshman aggregation
contributes two of the tackles who
are to go through the mill today in
the persons of big Ed Lettunich and
Dick Keller. In addition to these
first year men, there is Palamoun
tain, a big boy from the 1931 squad,
and Rogers, a transfer. But here
again, the men are merely on trial.
Work begins at 4:30 o'clock.
