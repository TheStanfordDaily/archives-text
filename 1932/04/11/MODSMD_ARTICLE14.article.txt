# Picturesque Norse Diver Walks In Lagunita Depths
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Deep-sea diver Henry V. Fuse,
picturesque Norwegian, speaking his
tired orders in quaint Norse accent,
face interesting in its furrows, shock
of dusty hair surmounted by a
stocking cap.
A surprisingly slight figure to be
incased in the ponderous bulk of
under-ocean suit, and to carry over
his stocking-head the heavy swollen
metal of the diving bell.
He, who yesterday for a day be
came the kindly spirit of Lagunita,
evidenced relief frym strain when
his duty was over. Trudging, trudg- |
ing, lifting leaden feet against the
pressure of a blind world of water,
is an unreal and curiously exhaus
tive duty.
Leads Varied Life
Henry Fuse is a man of many
tasks. Early this week lie mended a
broken cable on the floor of San (
Francisco bay. A couple of days ago (
he was busy refitting an iron shoe i
to the foot of a great piling. Last
year he raced with other salvagers,
some armed with machine guns, to
the suspected locale of the Brother
Jonathan, clipper-ship which went

| down sixty years ago off the coast
of Oregon with seven million dollars
in its hold.
Once, called to search for a high -
, school girl, believed lost because of
suicide notes, Fuse surveyed the
water and refused to go in, declar
ing she was not there to be found.
Nor was she, but, happily, alive
, and hiding.
Search Prolonged
The deep-sea diver admits that
his campus search took longer than
he expected. Arriving at dawn, he
had hoped by the simple structure
of (he lake to have finished by 9
o'clock. Vagueness as to specific lo
cale (tf Ihc tragedy, and poor luck
absorbed the morning in widespread,
plodding search.
i Going ashore at noon for a brief
respite, Fuse sat down to think, then
determined to act on a hunch.
1 Climing back down his ladder into
I the noon blackness, where touch
i must serve in place of sight, Fuse
felt along nearer the shore, and by
kindly accident, by (he merest mar
gin of an inch, he happened to slip
his fingers into the welcoming hand
of Webster.
