# STANFORD NINE OUTSLUGS U. C. IN 7-3 BATTLE
## Livermore's Triple Starts First Three-Run Rally; Philippi Hits Hard 
### Bob Wade 
Three hits in the sixth and five in
the seventh, good for a trio of runs
each time, were all that Stanford
needed to take the second game of
the annual series from the Califor
nia baseball varsity Saturday on the
sunken diamond. However, the In
dians had collected one in the third
frame to make it a decisive 7-3 ver
dict.
California drew first blood in the
second inning. Mclntyre reached
first when Goodell pulled his foot
oIT the bag, took second on Liver
more's error, advanced to third when
Wolfman flied to right, and scored
on Rawles' single.
Kmtala Tallies
Hintala evened the count in the
third when he singled, advanced to
third on a pair of bobbles by Adams,
Bear shortstop, and scored on Phil
ippi's single.
California collected another in the
fifth, with two singles and Rintala's
error, but the Indians came back in
the sixth, after the Bears had scored
another on errors, to stage the first
of the three-run rallies, which was
featured by Livermore's triple.
Peterson Weakens
Philippi singled for the third time,
Goodell walked, Livermore tripled,
and Miles singled. Peterson had
been pitching good ball until the
sixth, but the combination of poor
support and hard hitting by the In
dians was too much for him, and his
control began to weaken.
Stanford paused only long enough
to get three Bears out of the way,
and then resumed the attack. Hin
tala singled, Delmas singled, Camp
bell doubled, Philippi collected his
fourth bingle and Goodell singled.
California banged out two singles
in the eighth, but could do nothing
in the scoring line, as Trautman
made one putout on a fly and the
other two on force-outs.
Bears Fail to Score
In the ninth California got pinch
hitter Jacobson on first, but Peter
son hit into a double-play, Philippi
to Delmas to Goodell, and Kirwan
grounded out, Trautman to Goodell.
For Stanford, Anderson pitched
nice ball through the nine inn
ings, allowing the visitors only seven
hits, and keeping them well in hand.
Peterson hurled a good game, but
his team's three errors came when
they could do the most damage.
Philippi led the Stanford attack,
hitting four'for four. Adams and
Mclntyre topped the Bears getting
two singles in four tries.

Three hits in the sixth and five in
the seventh, good for a trio of runs
each time, were all that Stanford
needed to take the second game of
the annual series from the Califor
nia baseball varsity Saturday on the
sunken diamond. However, the In
dians had collected one in the third
frame to make it a decisive 7-3 ver
dict.
California drew first blood in the
second inning. Mclntyre reached
first when Goodell pulled his foot
oIT the bag, took second on Liver
more's error, advanced to third when
Wolfman flied to right, and scored
on Rawles' single.
Kmtala Tallies
Hintala evened the count in the
third when he singled, advanced to
third on a pair of bobbles by Adams,
Bear shortstop, and scored on Phil
ippi's single.
California collected another in the
fifth, with two singles and Rintala's
error, but the Indians came back in
the sixth, after the Bears had scored
another on errors, to stage the first
of the three-run rallies, which was
featured by Livermore's triple.
Peterson Weakens
Philippi singled for the third time,
Goodell walked, Livermore tripled,
and Miles singled. Peterson had
been pitching good ball until the
sixth, but the combination of poor
support and hard hitting by the In
dians was too much for him, and his
control began to weaken.
Stanford paused only long enough
to get three Bears out of the way,
and then resumed the attack. Hin
tala singled, Delmas singled, Camp
bell doubled, Philippi collected his
fourth bingle and Goodell singled.
California banged out two singles
in the eighth, but could do nothing
in the scoring line, as Trautman
made one putout on a fly and the
other two on force-outs.
Bears Fail to Score
In the ninth California got pinch
hitter Jacobson on first, but Peter
son hit into a double-play, Philippi
to Delmas to Goodell, and Kirwan
grounded out, Trautman to Goodell.
For Stanford, Anderson pitched
nice ball through the nine inn
ings, allowing the visitors only seven
hits, and keeping them well in hand.
Peterson hurled a good game, but
his team's three errors came when
they could do the most damage.
Philippi led the Stanford attack,
hitting four'for four. Adams and
Mclntyre topped the Bears getting
two singles in four tries.
