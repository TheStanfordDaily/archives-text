# Sideline Scenes During Lagunita Rescue Attempt
## Wiget Dives For Hours; Dancers Unaware 
### 
Just across the meadow —soft-
i lighted—contrast to the black, in
different haunch of Lagunita, Stan
ford's staunchest dance, unknowing.

Ted Wiget, first to the scene, pad
j dling in gigantic strokes across the
! echoing dark, dives for two hours
j without rest, over a commonplace,
yet somehow magically-hopeful spot
in the lake.

A big night for campus corre
j spondents. Student pensters of the
| News and Mercury arrive, foolish and
j saucer-eyed, with th 6 story on the
wires an hour since. Scooped again.
«* * v
Mercury hireling, anxious to re
trieve the scoop, canoes hastily to
the scene, capsizing in his zest. Sea
going journalist, scrambling in real
and comic terror for the nearest
l rescuer.

Ambulance waiting, crouched in
the dark beside the boathouse. Lack
ing the cheerful glamor of the grid
iron ambulance—this one menaces
| like a somber cat, safe in the gloom.

"Given up" is the dull word at 2
; o'clock. Sequoia men stay to search
i all night.

Pete Desjardins lines up a brisk
; squad of divers, fifteen men long,
j Up and over, up and over, an auto
i matic comb, plunging raggedly
through the water.

"Bus" Webster was not fearsome
to look upon in death. Cord-clad,
shirt tails out in little boy fashion,
young despair written on his face,
he was gathered gently up into the
! arms of his new friends.
