Running in the United States, Big
Ben Eastman, English in/name, Stan
ford Indian by adoption, and Scotch
in habit, last Saturday afternoon
broke the world's half-mile record
that belonged to a German and had
been set in England. Eastman dem
onstrated his Scotch frugality when
he consumed but one meagre min
ute, fifty-one and thuee-tenths short
seconds literally t<i sprint twice
1 around Stanford's (/id oval in less
time than anyone/ else has ever
needed to run 880 yards.
i Eastman's effort aclipsed by three
tenths of a second Dr. Otto Peltzer s
recognized world's half-mile record.
; Peltzer, the pride of Germany's ath
: letes, set his mark in 1020 in Eng
land; hence Eastman's internation
al it y.
Stanford won the triangular meet
by scoring 78 points to GO for the
Olympic Club and 10 for S.F.U., and
it was mainly due to the efforts of
Gus Meier and Ollie Amdahl.
Speedy Finishes
Meier took Podge Smith, former
| Indian captain now running for the
Club, in both hurdle races by fast
finishes. Gus won the highs in the
(exceptional time of 14.0, and then
beat Podge to the tape in a 24-llat
low hurdle flight.
Shuffling Amdahl again broke his
i own record in the two-mile, running
0:44.7 to take second place away
i from Gerieke of the Olympic Club.
Amdahl, although apparently ready
to drop at the end of each lap,
I showed fine judgment of pace, stay
i mg with Hill, the winner, for the first
I mile, then laying back till the last
1 220 when he sprinted to pass Ger
' icke in the day's most exciting race.
50 Feel for Gray
The entire meet was the most en
[ couraging held to date from Stan
ford's viewpoint. Nellie Gray threw
! the shot 50 feet, 2 inches, beating
his teammates, Laborde and Lyman.
Gray also shared in the ten points
! scored by the Cards in the discus,
jgctling third behind Bob Jones and
! Laborde.
Bill Werder found the California
sun to his liking, and broad-jumped
i 23 feet 5 8 inch, being beaten out. of
first place by Kim Dyer by less than
| 2 inches. Bill Willard did 22 feet, 8
| inches and Wally Butler 22 feet, 0
inches for third and fourth.
The Indian quartette climaxed the
I day by winning the relay. Captain
I Alvin Hables, in his first appearance
