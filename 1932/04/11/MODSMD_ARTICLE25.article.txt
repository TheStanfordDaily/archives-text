# "OLD BOY" PROWLS ABOUT TOMORROW
## 
### 
Old Man Chappie has thrown
away his grey flannels and white
sweater, and will prowl the campus
tomorrow in a black suit and a fake
beard, for Hammer and Coffin's
long delayed "Mystery Number"
will appear at that time.
Efforts to locate the Ancient One
have proved unavailing, but word
has been passed around thai this
issue will be one of the largest of
the year, and countless new wise
cracks will be exposed by that Mas
ter Revealer, Ihe Old Boy, author
of "Revealing as I Know It, and
Wouldn't You, an' You, an' You,
Like to Know It?"
