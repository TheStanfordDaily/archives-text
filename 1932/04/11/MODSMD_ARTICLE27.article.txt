# THE 						"BLONDE CYCLONE"
## 
### 
Every so often I here comes along a I rack athlete whose
performances upset all previous ideas of sport experts in
regard to his special events, an athlete who so far surpasses
his predecessors that he is in a class by himself. Ralph
Hose, the great 1 lealdsburg shot putter who is still credited
with the longest put on record, was one of these giants of
sport in his generation; so were Ted Meredith and Paavo
Xurmi.
And now Stanford's own Hen Eastman has blasted his
way into the highest circles of this company of greats. At
lacking long-established records in the two most difficult
events on the list, Hen has accomplished in the past two
weeks a feat that has not even been attempted by the top
notch runners of the world since the days of Meredith's
pri me.
Eastman has established new world's records in the
half mile and quarter mile events, but he has done more
than that. Hy his superlative performances at such an
early stage of the season he lias set up new standards by
which all middle distance running must be judged. Times
which would have been considered excellent two weeks
ago, and which would still be so considered if Hen had
merely shaved one or two tenths of a second off the old
records, will now be regarded as unworthy of more than
passing mention. It is in this light that his greatness ap
pears most strongly, and it is this fact that lifts him out of
the ordinary class of record-breakers.
Challenged by no more than two or three runners in the
country last year, Eastman has now outstripped all compe
tition. II there is anyone in the world entitled to an equal
rating in either 1 10 or MO races, he has not yet been heard
of in the I nitcd States. For the moment, at least, Hen
Hangs Eastman stands on the ultimate pinnacle of the
track world.
