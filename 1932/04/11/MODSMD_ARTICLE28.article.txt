# ANOTHER A.W.S. BONER
## 
### 
A.W.S. potentates have scored another honer in their
choice o{' a voting system to he used in tomorrow's election.
The. Constitutional Revision Committee, by its decision
to hold two elections for A.W.S. ollices, made a wise ruling
. . . . but not a complete one. The position of A.W.S. presi
dent is a distinctive one and, as such, is set aside from the
oilier four Council positions. The present revision allows
women to run for ollices on Council who consider them
selves incapable or unable to hold the president's job.
Bui, in the remaining Council elections which are to be
run off tomorrow, the powers that be have swerved from
the path of common sense. Instead of employing the pref
erential system of voting used in last Tuesday's election,
they allow each woman to vote for two candidates, each
vote having equal weight in the final reckoning.
There are three glaring reasons why this system of vot
ing is ridiculous. It doubles the chance for objectionable
politics, by providing opportunity for vote trade between
living groups. It is inconsistent with the election system
used for A.W.S. president. Council elections, though held
on different days, should employ a uniform system of vot
ing for all ollices. It may result in the election of the weak
est candidate for a position. Voters will inevitably cast one
vote for their candidate and, to insure her election, will
cast the other for the candidate who has the least chance of
winning. A sutlicient number of such blind votes might in
sure the election of the least capable.

When the Constitutional Revision Committee made its
final decisions, il should have taken this matter into consid
eration. In a general reorganization of the A.NV.S. election
system there is no reason why such an important detail
should have been overlooked.
