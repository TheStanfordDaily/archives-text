Again the question of whether Ihe Concert Series should
he continued for another year will soon he facing the Ex
( culive (lommittee.
There are many points to he carefully considered in
deciding this question of which the most pertinent is, per
haps, financial. Although il is true that the Series has
never cost the A S.S.I', a cent that has not been repaid, it
is practically certain that they will go well into the red this
vcar. In ils present financial condition the student body
fund is unable to continue the concerts at the expense of
I lie A.S.S.I*.
The deplorable par! of the situation is that there arc
not enough students on this campus who enjoy good music
to make the Series a paying proposition. A large percent
age of Ihe audiences are composed of Palo Alto residents
and other outsiders. Quite prevalent among many of the
men's living groups is the prep school idea that to appre
ciate any music except a jazz band or a radio crooner is a
sign of femininity and quite unbecoming a virile Stanford
rough. This moronic belief, which, surprisingly enough, is
found in a group noted for ils high intelligence, is perhaps
one of the reasons wh\ Ihe Concert Series has had such a
difficult time.
The last concert of the year and maybe the last on this
campus lor many years, John Charles Thomas, will be held
Wednesday night. The student turnout to hear Thomas
mav have a material effect on whether or not Ihe Series
v. ill be continued. Every student who has the least desire
to hear these noted artists at such low prices during the
next few years should attend Wednesday night as a proof
that depression dances and movies are not the only forms
Â«.i entertainment which are of interest to Stanford students.
