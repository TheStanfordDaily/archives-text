# BULL SESSION
## WOLVES AND LAMBS 
### 
The stock market has ;i hypnotic |
i influence on everybody—which of j
course includes Congress. Waiij
Street's reputation has two distinct i
phases. One before the crash and ,
i one after it. Before the crash, Wall
Street was the mecca of American :
dollars, conversation, and interest, j
Mothers neglected their children — >
j husbands their wives—fathers their]
business—to read the financial pago. !
Over night, the nation was trans- j
1 formed into a race of financial ex- j
i perts and stock authorities.
To be uninterested in stocks was i
i tantamount to being uninterested ■
in boxing championships—which
] was Un-American, improper, and!
bordering on the dangerously ab
i normal. But suddenly something
happened—something very rude
, and startling. Then just as over
! night Wall Street had become an
idol of feverish worship, so over- ;
night it became a fiendish monster, j
It became the cause of the depres- |
j sion—the oppressor of the people— j
the blood-sucking vampire living |
j on the working man. Both atti- i
tudes are extreme but after all, pen- I
dulums must swing from one ex- j
treme to the other. Where else
can they swing without violating:
2)hysical law.
!
Congress has finally decided to I
carry forth the popular prejudice; j
a sweeping investigation (all ir.ves- |
ligations are) of the nefarious prac- ;
tices of the "bears" is to be launch- J
ed. The bears being the ones who
bring prices down—they are auto
i matically traitors to the country

and already have been accused of
being in league with Europe. Before
the investigation is over, a definite
link between the bears and the reds
will undoubtedly develop. What
could be better than a discovery that
Russia i-eally caused the bust of
"Black Friday"—the subsequent de
pression— and the also subsequent
lowering of Republican stock?
But while the "bears" are being
looked into, why not also give a
passing investigation to the "bulls"
—those that boosted the prices to
dizzy heights. Evidence now shows
that prices of stocks were too high.
Of course, it is good American doc
trine that nothing can be too high
in this country and therefore those
that boosted prices were merely
doing their duty—to country, to
God, and to the G.O.P. Yet, it seems
fair that if bulls can toss prices sky
ward; bears should be allowed to
force them into a deep hole.
We learn in economics classes that
the stock market i:; merely a baro
meter of conditions —not a cause of
them. If a group of men push down
the barometer, they can accomplish
nothing with business conditions; no
more than jamming a genuine baro
meter can alter weather conditions.
But a barometer does alter psych
ology and psychology does alter
business. Therefore, they may be
justified in investigating. Real re
sults will come, however, from study
ing those bulls that boosted psych
ology to such an extent as to make
inflation and resultant depression
possible. —Abe Mellinkoff
