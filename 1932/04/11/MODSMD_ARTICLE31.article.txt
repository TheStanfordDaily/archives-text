# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
Windjammer very graceless- '
ly admits that he's still around
this morning. Nobody hates
more than we do to go hack on
a promise, especially this one cif
clearing out in great haste, but
we have a swell alibi. Will Rog
ers will have to take care of the
travelogue for a couple of days
more.
| Yesterday was such a beautiful
time to start out, too. We sort of i
dreaded the brass bands and hulla- ,
baloo and copious tears which would !
inevitably accompany our leaving, |
and Sunday traffic might have cov- j
, ered it up pretty well.
Anyhow, we had the tooth
brush all packed and waiting in
the hallway, the reserve chcw
( ing gum supply was sealed and
ready for shipment, and then
we suddenly realized that we
hadn't decided which way to j
start on this history-making tour
of the world we told you about
the other day.
Starting east, of course, there
j would be Reno and Utah and New
Jersey and the Department of the
Interior Office to visit and talk
about. But someone might mistake
our toothbrush for the Lindbergh
baby and that would complicate
i things considerably.

On the other hand, if we
started west across the great,
blue, beautiful, turbulent, trou
i bled, ever-changing, thunderous,
mysterious, ponderous Pacific,
we'd be apt to get run down by
an anti-aircraft crew on the high
seas, and then where would the
colyum be?
So we've decided to hang around
' for a couple of days and talk to
| people who know something about
I the travel business.
The Call of the West got pretty
; strong on Saturday afternoon, so we
I made a trial trip as far as Menlo.
i Something happened to us there,
j thoughâ€”dunno whether it was the
| rocky ride up, or the heat or the
j humidity or the scenic attractions,
! but anyway time slipped by some-
I how, while we tried to get cool and
! comfortable after the approved
Menlo mariner, and all of a sudden
it was Sunday morning, and there
we were!
It's never a good idea to start
things on Sunday, anyhow (and
as many more excuses as you
can think of asking for, thank
you) so it's a nice morning and
while you're all in classes we're
reading travel pamphlets and
thinking about India. Oh, to be a
Gandhi, and completely un-in
| liibitcd, to boot ....
