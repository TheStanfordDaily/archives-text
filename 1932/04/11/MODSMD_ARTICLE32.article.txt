ing, the Right Reverend Edward L.
Parsons, Bishop of California, spoke
of the relationship of the spiritual
ideal. "The only way in which the

ment of a spiritual ideal."
The problem of where we are
i going in life, Bishop Parsons said, is
t not a new one, but has existed
through Ihe ages. Material ideals
t would not solve the question in the
past, they cannot now. We must
realize that there is something be

which is greater than the mere do
ing of things. Those things must
take on a meaning in the light of
progress of the universe.
