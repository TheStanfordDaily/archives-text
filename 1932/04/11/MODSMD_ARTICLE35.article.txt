SHE WANTED A MILLIONAIRE.
At the New Stanford
A light, tricky play with an im- '
possible plot—but well enough done '
to excuse all of that. And Joan 1
| Bennett is as lovely as ever. She i
plays the young factory girl to per- j
j fection. She looks as if she were j
; destined for money — she wants |
i money—and shet gets it, therein lies
i the impossibility of it all.
James Kirkwood and a pack of \
giant dogs lend menace, at the end. j
But before that comes a bathing
beauty contest, and the crowning j
of Miss Missouri as Miss Universe, j
nee Joan.
Spencer Tracy, a new addition to j
moviedom, does the only real acting j
in the entire show. Apologies to
Una Merkel—who does her usual j
1 peppy bit, with the Southern drawl, j
strangely in place this time.
There's a Mickey Mouse comedy j
1 —better than ever.
—V. B. T.
