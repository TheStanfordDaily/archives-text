Here is Big Ben Eastman just beginning to open up after Ins first 440 in Saturday's record-smashing race.
About 3 seconds before this picture was taken Eastman started his second-lap stride, steadily lengthening* the
distance between himself and Markle to 54 yards. The track shoes immediately behind Eastman belong to
Knowlcs, Olympic Club, followed by Bob Brown, of the Club, Naylon, Stanford, and Markle, of the Club.
