THE EASTMAN LIMITED was a
little off schedule during Saturday's
run, but still steamed into the ter
minal in record-breaking time.
Instead of the crucial retch be
tvveen the 440 and 660 marks, which
had been giving him so much trou
ble iu practice, it was the first 440 .
yards which threw the Blazing Ben J
oft schedule. According to semi-of- j
ficial time announced by Bill El- ;
lington, Eastman reached the 440- j
yard post in 53.8 seconds, at least a
second slower than the time Ben i
was aiming at.
Then in the third furlong he j
turned loose a burst of speed which
took him to the (560-yard marker in
1:1H.2, just 24.4 seconds later. He j
had more than made up for lost
lime in that stretch, but had lost
powei for the final dash to the tape.
THAT LAST furlong was a
tough one for Eastman. Where
under ordinary circumstances it
would not have taken more than
'JO seconds, it consumed 33.1
seconds, according to Ellington's
figures. He started to "tie up" as
he came out of the final turn
behind (he field stands, but
came out of it before it robbed
him of the record.
While three of the four official
timers stopped their watches at
1:51.3 as the tape broke (the
fourth had 1:51.4), unofficial time
for (he various divisions of the
race varied greatly. The 44!) was
caught as low as 5.5..'! and the (i(»0
as high as 1:22.
Give Ben more practice at per
fecting his pace, and he'll crack
that record by far more (ban he
did Saturday.
MANY FANS remarked at East
man's good fortune in drawing the
pole position in Saturday's race. It
wasn't good fortune, but the gener
osity of Dixon of the Olympic Club.
Eastman actually drew number
(wo position, but Dixon, who had
been awarded the pole, graciously
offered to trade places with him.
ALMOST OVERLOOKED in
the excitement of crowning a
world champion for the second
time in two weeks were the per
' formances of several other Stan
ford men. (Jus Meier performed
brilliantly in winning both hur
dle events, being timed in 14.!)
seconds in the high slicks for
tiie first time in his career.
Another Indian who bea( his
own best previous effort was
Nellie Gray with bis tremendous
heave of 50 feet two inches in
the shot-put. Ollie Amdahl,
while not winning the two-mile
grind, finished second in 9:44.2,
taking some five seconds off of
his own record. Keep an eye on
Amdahl!
C ALIFORNIANS CAN chortle
with glee over two events of the
week-end. Heading the list was the j
overwhelming victory scored by the !
Bear crew over the University of !
Washington. California won by 18 i
lengths to get away to a good start ;
on the long road to the world title i
the Bears won at the last Olympics. 1
More important to Stanford was'
Bob Kiesel's surprising 9.5 time in !
the century in the California-J.C.
meet at Berkeley. Kiesel was sec
ond to Frankie Wykoff just a week
ago in a race that was won in the
much lower time of 9.8. Les Hables
appears k) have his work cut out
for him. —L.M.C.

heave of 50 feet two inches in
the shot-put. Ollie Amdahl,

Amdahl!
C ALIFORNIANS CAN chortle
with glee over two events of the
week-end. Heading the list was the j
overwhelming victory scored by the !
Bear crew over the University of !
Washington. California won by 18 i
lengths to get away to a good start ;
on the long road to the world title i
the Bears won at the last Olympics. 1
More important to Stanford was'
Bob Kiesel's surprising 9.5 time in !
the century in the California-J.C.
meet at Berkeley. Kiesel was sec
ond to Frankie Wykoff just a week
ago in a race that was won in the
much lower time of 9.8. Les Hables
appears k) have his work cut out
for him. —L.M.C.
THE EASTMAN LIMITED was a
little off schedule during Saturday's
run, but still steamed into the ter
minal in record-breaking time.
Instead of the crucial retch be
tvveen the 440 and 660 marks, which
had been giving him so much trou
ble iu practice, it was the first 440 .
yards which threw the Blazing Ben J
oft schedule. According to semi-of- j
ficial time announced by Bill El- ;
lington, Eastman reached the 440- j
yard post in 53.8 seconds, at least a
second slower than the time Ben i
was aiming at.
Then in the third furlong he j
turned loose a burst of speed which
took him to the (560-yard marker in
1:1H.2, just 24.4 seconds later. He j
had more than made up for lost
lime in that stretch, but had lost
powei for the final dash to the tape.
THAT LAST furlong was a
tough one for Eastman. Where
under ordinary circumstances it
would not have taken more than
'JO seconds, it consumed 33.1
seconds, according to Ellington's
figures. He started to "tie up" as
he came out of the final turn
behind (he field stands, but
came out of it before it robbed
him of the record.
While three of the four official
timers stopped their watches at
1:51.3 as the tape broke (the
fourth had 1:51.4), unofficial time
for (he various divisions of the
race varied greatly. The 44!) was
caught as low as 5.5..'! and the (i(»0
as high as 1:22.
Give Ben more practice at per
fecting his pace, and he'll crack
that record by far more (ban he
did Saturday.
MANY FANS remarked at East
man's good fortune in drawing the
pole position in Saturday's race. It
wasn't good fortune, but the gener
osity of Dixon of the Olympic Club.
Eastman actually drew number
(wo position, but Dixon, who had
been awarded the pole, graciously
offered to trade places with him.
ALMOST OVERLOOKED in
the excitement of crowning a
world champion for the second
time in two weeks were the per
' formances of several other Stan
ford men. (Jus Meier performed
brilliantly in winning both hur
dle events, being timed in 14.!)
seconds in the high slicks for
tiie first time in his career.
