# WHITES DOWN REDS IN 7-2 POLO MATCH
## Spalding Leads Scorers With Four Goals 
### Bill Myers 
Unable to stop Rufus Spalding, j
scoring ace of the Whites, the Reds |
were humbled, 7-2. in a speedy polo ,
match Friday afternoon on the
Highway field.
The game, an intra-squad tilt be- |
tween members of the A squad, j
settled temporarily the supremacy j
of these warring outfits. The cham- ;
pionships not likely to remain long i
fixed for the Reds have already j
challenged the Whites to a return j
match sometime this month. 1
Fleming and Lewis at three and |
four on the crimson-jersied outfit ■
left nothing (o be desired in the way ;
of defense, but lacked support from j
Holt and Crawford as numbers one j
and two.
Spalding, diminutive number two j
on the Whites, couldn't be stopped, I
and accounted for four of the seven j
goals scored by his four. He was !
responsible for getting the ball in j
scoring position for two more goals j
which were poked in by Boyles, !
number four.
The game was slowed up in some j
chukkers by mounts that were prac- '
tically unmanageable due to their 1
long lay-oft since the middle of
March.
The line-ups:
Reds Position Whites i
Holt 1 Gillham j
Crawford 2 Spalding i
Lewis 3 Melone j
Fleming 4 Boyles!
