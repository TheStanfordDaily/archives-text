# FROSH TRACKMEN DOWN SAN MATEO BY 79-42 SCORE
## Morentin, Schween Shine; Clean Sweep Marks Low Stick Race 
### Albert Guerard 
Two former high school track
champions came through in a big j
way last Friday, and provided the i
few thrills of the Stanford fresh- ;
men's 79 1 v:-42 1 u victory over San
Mateo Junior College s Bulldogs.
Phil Morentin, the long-striding
runner who twice brought the state
mile championship to Visalia High, j
won the four-lap race in 4:38. Had |
Morentin run his first quarter two
seconds slower, the seemingly tire- j
less little miler would probably j
have cut many seconds off a slow j
third lap, and approached his best ,
high school mark of 4:31.
Schween Leaps
Had Bob King, 1928 Olympic high !
jump champion, been in the stands j
Friday, he would have good cause J
to worry about his freshman rec- i
ord of li feet 2 inches which will
face the attacks of Stanford and I
California freshman jumpers in the
Little Big Meet next Friday. Lloyd
Schween, former Salinas High ath
lete, skimmed over (! feet : 's inch
with consummate ease.
Hurdles Win
Stanford took seventeen points in
the hurdle races, with Bowles just
nosing out Savage in the highs,
and Cotton, Savage, and Buffum
easily engineering a clean sweep
over the San Mateo low hurdles.
Other Indian athletes turning in vic
tories included A1 Blackmail, 100

Two former high school track
champions came through in a big j
way last Friday, and provided the i
few thrills of the Stanford fresh- ;
men's 79 1 v:-42 1 u victory over San
Mateo Junior College s Bulldogs.
Phil Morentin, the long-striding
runner who twice brought the state
mile championship to Visalia High, j
won the four-lap race in 4:38. Had |
Morentin run his first quarter two
seconds slower, the seemingly tire- j
less little miler would probably j
have cut many seconds off a slow j
third lap, and approached his best ,
high school mark of 4:31.
Schween Leaps
Had Bob King, 1928 Olympic high !
jump champion, been in the stands j
Friday, he would have good cause J
to worry about his freshman rec- i
ord of li feet 2 inches which will
face the attacks of Stanford and I
California freshman jumpers in the
Little Big Meet next Friday. Lloyd
Schween, former Salinas High ath
lete, skimmed over (! feet : 's inch
with consummate ease.
Hurdles Win
Stanford took seventeen points in
the hurdle races, with Bowles just
nosing out Savage in the highs,
and Cotton, Savage, and Buffum
easily engineering a clean sweep
over the San Mateo low hurdles.
Other Indian athletes turning in vic
tories included A1 Blackmail, 100

broad jump; Rothert, pole vault;
