Clyde Blanchard, University of Arizona athlete who stowed away
on a boat to attend the 1928 Olympics after in'luenza had interfered
with his making the United States team, is working for another chance
in the games to be held at Los Angeles this summer. He has a mark
of 53.2 seconds in the 440-yard hurdles.
