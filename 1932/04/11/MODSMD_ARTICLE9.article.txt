The common herd of Stanford un
| dergraduates was left out of the
j exclusive presentation of two of the
j most delicious plays seen on a j
j Stanford stage in some time. The
| plays, "Midsummer Night's Dean," I
a very delicate fantasy written by i
j Professor Frederick Anderson, and |
lan amusing, if somewhat light, sa-[
; tire, "Reductio Ad Absurdum," fea- j
tured the entertainment presented I
Friday night by the Faculty Worn- [
en's Club at their annual party. |
The whole performance gave an j
j appearance of finish which belied
! the inexperience of the actors, but
gave due credit to Harold Helven- I
ston's direction. Of the two plays, j
"Reductio Ad Absurdum," lacking j
j the fine subtlety of "Midsummer I
j Night's Dean," was rather better re- j
! ceived by the audience. With as- I
! sistance by two or three students, j
over twenty faculty members par-]
I ticipated in the plays.
Mrs. Albert Guerard had charge |
; of the Faculty Women's party, while '
j Professor W. L. Schwartz was the j
| property manager.
