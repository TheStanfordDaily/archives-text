# THREE STUDENT OFFICIALS QUIT IN RUSHING ROW
## Deuel, Harris, Campbell Resign Positions On Control Board 
### 
Three student members of the
Interfraternity Board of Control re
signed at a meeting of the Inter
fraternity Council last night, de
claring themselves unable to fall in
line with the majority opinion.
The council immediately elected
new members to sit at the board
meeting tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Old Union. Fred Scribner replaces
Johnnie Deuel as secretary of both
the board and council; Fred Glover
takes the place of Tom Campbell;
and Jack Hinchliffe replaces Larry
Harris.
Repeat Stand
By a unanimous opinion the coun
cil reiterated its stand in favor of
rushing this quarter with no pen
alty. This stand is based on the
body's expressed desire to co-oper
ate with the board in abolishing il
legal rushing. Â»
It is felt by council members that
doing away with the present penalty
is logical in the view of its desire
to start out next year under a new
set of rushing rules, drawn up to
obliviate present illegal rushing
evils. The body has presented a set
of resolutions which outline a new
rushing system. It was brought out
at last night's meetitng that a com
mittee from the board composed of
Professor Elmer Fagan, Ike Liver
more, and Wayne Ketron is work
ing on the same problem.
Meeting Tonight
The Interfraternity Board meets
tonight to come to a decision on the
question as to whether the fraterni
ties should be allowed to rush this
quarter, or whether the present
penalty prohibiting rushing the
Class of 1935 until next autumn
quarter should continue to be en
forced. Members were divided on
the question of retaining the pi'es
ent penalty, or the substitution of
an alternative with rushing this
quarter.
Resolutions were also passed by
the council deciding not to hold an
interfraternity dance this quarter,
and providing that only one student
member from any one house could
sit on the board at a time.
