# SAFFORD WILL PLAY MUSIC FROM OPERA HANSEL AND GRETEL
## 
### 
In his organ recital this afternoon
! at 5:10 o'clock in the Stanford Me-
I morial Church, Charles L. SafTord.,
j visiting organist, will play "Hansel
I and Gretel" by Humperdinck. This
I composition was one of the most
j talked-of works of his.
It raised Humperdinck with lightâ€”
i ning rapidity to a high pinnacle of
! popular fame. Perhaps its appeal
j lies in the fact that it served as an
j antidote to the lurid works of the
I young Italian school which was
j prevalent at the time.
Other members which will make
i up the program are:
I Carillon of Westminster Vierne
) Dream Pantomime from Hansel
and Gretel Humperdinck
j Toccato in F Widor
j Andante Cantabile... .Tschaikowsky
