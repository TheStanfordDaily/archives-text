has turned over to the League of
Nations the whole subject of with
drawal of Japanese troops from the
Shanghai area, the Associated Press
was informed tonight by Quo Tai-
Chi, Chief of the Chinese delegation
attending the peace parleys here.
"This conference apparently is
hopeless," he said, "but maybe the
League can help. The Japanese have
refused to set a time limit on their
withdrawal and if they persist in
this view the conference is doomed
to fail."
