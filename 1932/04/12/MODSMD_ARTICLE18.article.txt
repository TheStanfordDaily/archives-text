# INDIANS DOPED TO SMASH BIG MEET RECORDS
## Ellin Predicts Score Of 98 Or 100 Points For Cardinals 
### 
Preparing to witness the merry I
funeral of California's Golden Bear i
next Saturday afternoon, the Stan- i
ford campus is itself buried beneath |
an avalanche of questions as the Big j
Meet daily draws nearer.
"Will the Indians break the Big j
Meet high-point record set last
year?" "How many new individual j
marks will fall?" "Can Nellie Gray j
or John Lyman lake Hank Deßerry
in the shot-put?" "Is Kiesel good
enough to beat Les Hables?" "Will
Ben Eastman again break the tape
three times?"—these are but a few |
of the queries that are flying thick |
and fast over the Farm as Walt ,
Christie prepares his marvelous new '
track and his older and less excel- '
lent track team for the Card inva- ]
sion next Saturday.
May Surpass Record
In last season's practice workout
against the Bears, Templeton's
spikemen scored 101 2-3 points to j
29 1-3 for the squad that Brick j
Morse doped to win. This year ;
Morse's fluent pen has not dared to
predict a California victory, but j
Coach Bill Ellington of the Indians
has taken it upon himself to issue j
the bold prediction that Stanford
will win, scoring between 98 and 100
points while so doing.
Ellington is a swell track coach, \
but like many of his specie, is often !
afflicted with attacks of conserva
tism. For, if every Indian tomahawk ,
is at its keenest, the Big Meet rec
ord may well be doomed. There is
even a chance, if a slight one, that
the 102 1-3 to 28 2-3 victory margin
registered by U.S.C. over the Bears j
will be surpassed.
Hables and Kiesel
As for slim Les Hables and j
chunky Bob Kiesel, the latter must j
be given an edge in the 100 because 1
Hables just emerged from one of his j
periodic trips to the hospital and |
because Kiesel is credited, by Cali
fornia officials, with a mark of 9.5.
Kiesel or Hables should break Hec i
Dyer's and Barber's Big Meet rec- |
ord of 9.8 for the century.
Hank Deßerry, the giant who |
threw the shot over 50 feet against •
Troy, is California's only other out- I
standing victory hope. But Nellie j
Gray has a neat mark of his own 1
that is but one-half inch behind j
Deßerry's best, and Lyman is capa- |
ble of giving both plenty of compe- j
tition.
Other records that are in danger j
are Bud Spencer's 48 flat in the |
quarter-mile and Richardson's 1:53.8
in the 880. Need! ess to say, Ben
Eastman is the big threat in both ;
cases..

ble of giving both plenty of compe- j
tition.
Other records that are in danger j
are Bud Spencer's 48 flat in the |
quarter-mile and Richardson's 1:53.8
in the 880. Need! ess to say, Ben
Eastman is the big threat in both ;
cases..
Preparing to witness the merry I
funeral of California's Golden Bear i
next Saturday afternoon, the Stan- i
ford campus is itself buried beneath |
an avalanche of questions as the Big j
Meet daily draws nearer.
"Will the Indians break the Big j
Meet high-point record set last
year?" "How many new individual j
marks will fall?" "Can Nellie Gray j
or John Lyman lake Hank Deßerry
in the shot-put?" "Is Kiesel good
enough to beat Les Hables?" "Will
Ben Eastman again break the tape
three times?"—these are but a few |
of the queries that are flying thick |
and fast over the Farm as Walt ,
Christie prepares his marvelous new '
track and his older and less excel- '
lent track team for the Card inva- ]
sion next Saturday.
May Surpass Record
In last season's practice workout
against the Bears, Templeton's
spikemen scored 101 2-3 points to j
29 1-3 for the squad that Brick j
Morse doped to win. This year ;
Morse's fluent pen has not dared to
predict a California victory, but j
Coach Bill Ellington of the Indians
has taken it upon himself to issue j
the bold prediction that Stanford
will win, scoring between 98 and 100
points while so doing.
Ellington is a swell track coach, \
but like many of his specie, is often !
afflicted with attacks of conserva
tism. For, if every Indian tomahawk ,
is at its keenest, the Big Meet rec
ord may well be doomed. There is
even a chance, if a slight one, that
the 102 1-3 to 28 2-3 victory margin
registered by U.S.C. over the Bears j
will be surpassed.
Hables and Kiesel
As for slim Les Hables and j
chunky Bob Kiesel, the latter must j
be given an edge in the 100 because 1
Hables just emerged from one of his j
periodic trips to the hospital and |
because Kiesel is credited, by Cali
fornia officials, with a mark of 9.5.
Kiesel or Hables should break Hec i
Dyer's and Barber's Big Meet rec- |
ord of 9.8 for the century.
Hank Deßerry, the giant who |
threw the shot over 50 feet against •
Troy, is California's only other out- I
standing victory hope. But Nellie j
Gray has a neat mark of his own 1
that is but one-half inch behind j
Deßerry's best, and Lyman is capa- |
ble of giving both plenty of compe- j
tition.
