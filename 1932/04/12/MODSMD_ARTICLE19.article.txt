# Kreutzberg Dances Please S.F. Crowd
## 
### 
Harold Kreutzberg and his group
of four gave a dance concert at the
Tivoli theatre in San Francisco last
Sunday afternoon to a very meagre
audience, the small attendance be
ing due largely to the fact that the
Paderewski concert was also on
Sunday.
The program included several new
dances as well as some of the old
favorites, which give to Kreutzberg
the high place in the theatre which
he enjoys. The audience felt the ab
sence of Yvonne Georgi, his former
partner, to a great extent.
