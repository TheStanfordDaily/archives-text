# NEVERS' BERTH AS GRID COACH YET UNCERTAIN
## Information Correct, But Okeh By Trustees Not Assured B.A.C. BACKS DECISION Budget Difficulty May Ban New Appointment 
### 
Ernie Nevers, former Stanford
football star and All-American, was
; recommended for appointment to the
coaching stall here by the Board of
Athletic Control at its meeting Sun
| day afternoon, announced a San
Francisco newspaper last night.
This information, gained from an
unknown but "absolutely reliable
j source," is correct but the intima
j tion in the published article that
the Board's action practically settles
the matter and that confirmation by
! the president of the University and
the Board of Trustees would be
; simply automatic is erroneous.
A representative of the STAN
FORD DAILY was present at the
meeting Sunday as ex officio mem
ber of the Board. However, no story
of the appointment of Nevers was
run in the DAILY because of the
serious difficulties that would arise
j should such information be made
j generally known at this time.
Cut Costs
Because of lack of funds the Uni
; versity has been curtailing the ex-
J penditures of all departments and
i the appointment of an additional
1 member of the coaching staff will
have to be considered in the light
i of this general effort to keep down
! the departmental budgets. Thus,
I from purely financial reasons, the
: matter is far from settled.
However, the San Francisco paper,
j receiving its information through
some leak, saw fit to run the article
| concerning Nevers' appointment,
i thus placing the University in an
! embarrassing position and unques
} tionably doing Ernie's reputation
; great, though unjust harm, if the
, recommendation is not approved.
Board is Silent
The article in question stated that
. the members of the Board of Ath
j letic Control would give out no in
j formation. They realized the con.se
! quences that the appearance of the
story before the Board of Trustees
i met would have, both as to injuring
j Nevers and compromising the Uni-
I versity.
Until after the next meeting of
1 the Board of Trustees, no one will
know whether or not Ernie Nevers
will become a member of the Stan-
I ford coaching staff for next year.
