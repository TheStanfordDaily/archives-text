# "STANFORD'S INC." GUARANTEES BIG '36 FROSH CLASS
## 
### 
"Stanford's, Inc.," with which
is combined the 8.A.C., is
starting its spring campaign for
higher registration in ihe fall.
"We want more 'dead game
sports an' bang up blood' in
school and we are gonna get
'em," they shout, according to
Chappie.
"Read our scathing telegram
to "Life," '"Judge," and "Bal
lyhoo" (also humor publica
tions). pointing out their sinful
fall from honor, and be grate
ful that your two bits will pur
chase scintillating witticism
that is months ahead of the
market!"
So stated the Old Boy of
Hammer and Coffin as he mus
ingly but not unkindly tore up
between his teeth five copies of
the aforementioned chuckle
magazines.
After five years of research.
Chappie is revealing just when;
the $114.00 of tuition goes and
how it is used (in six easy
lessons).
A potent cover of modern
gangdom, and a full-page
drawing opening the issue
showing Mr. Hoover's dilemma,
are the brighter spots among
very bright art work.
