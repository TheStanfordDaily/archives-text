In ils zeal lo score a scoop over rival newspapers a cer
tain newspaper in San Francisco learned through some
"authoritative source" that the Stanford Hoard of Athletic
Control had recommended (lie appointment of Ernie Xev
ers to the toothall coaching stall', which it printed irregard
less of the results that such a storv appearing at this time
might have.
It the appointment ot Xevers is not confirmed by the
Hoard ot ! rustees and the president of the University, a
gieat injustice will have been done Xevers which no
amount of publicizing the reasons for rejecting the recom
mendation can correct. It would appear something had
been learned about Xevers after the meeting of the Board
of Athletic Control and prior to the meeting of the Board
of I rustees which would make him undesirable as a Stan
ford coach.
Such is far from the truth. The difficulty with hiring
another member of the coaching staff is purely financial.
Nc\eis qualifications as a football coach are unquestion
able and it is agreed that he would he a valuable asset to
the Indian grid teams.
I he newspaper that broke the story knew that the mat
ter was far from settled and also that printing the story
would jeopardize Xevers' reputation and would place the
I .Diversity in a difficult situation. Irregardless of this, the
paper ran the story on which it would have had a fair
break with other papers when the announcement came
through the regular channels.
Scoopitis, a common journalistic disease, overcame
newspaper ethics. Just to beat a rival paper to a story is
a poor excuse for printing information which will do ir
reparable harm.
