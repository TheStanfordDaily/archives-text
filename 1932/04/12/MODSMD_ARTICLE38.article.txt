I hose sports writing skeptics >vho raised their eyebrows
when intorined that a 20-year-old Stanford lad named Hen
Kastinan had sliced a full second off a world's 110 mark
that had stood for 1(5 years can now he hardlv otherwise
than satisfied.
I poii hearing that Hon shattered the 880-yard record
Saturday, just two weeks later, those more ribald doubters
of the llenrv \Y. (June variety will very likely froth at the
mouth to become even more ridiculous in the eyes of fans
who know what Hen can and will do in the near future.
On the other hand, men throughout the country who
know enough about track to realize just how phenomenal
Eastman s teat was, and, never having seen him run,
thought "Maybe so, we'll watch reports on him from now
on will doubtless be convinced by Hen's second triumph.
This fellow C.lune is the alleged track expert of Rochcs
ter, New York, who moaned "Fraud!" after the 110 mark
tell, and became more humorous than he had intended
when he charged that Hen had been timed on the town hall
clock.
The passage of time will take care of this critic. Per
haps his rude awakening as Kastman continues to equal or
even lower his new marks will be punishment enough. Hut
how a writer posing as a track expert can read of the con
ditions under which the marks were made and still brand
them "ridiculous" is beyond comprehension.
Tew world's records are anticipated. Hen's were. There
lore the precautions taken to insure recognition of his
times were "right" to the smallest detail.
The track was measured and found to be four and one
eighth inches more than 110 yards. A wind gauge showed
a breeze considerably under four miles per hour, the al
lowed force. A starter accepted as one of the best in the
West was secured and four qualified A.A.l T . timers held
the stop watches.
Mr. C.lune and other skeptics might save themselves
later embarrassment by noting these facts carefully before
venting their incredulity in public print.
