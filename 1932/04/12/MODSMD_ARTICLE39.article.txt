Twenty precocious high school graduates between the j
ages of lit and lf> will be admitted to Northwestern Univer
sity next year in pursuance of a plan to develop super
intelligent beings through new educational methods.
The experiment may be successful, but the prospect
lacing the children who are to be prematurely rushed into
college is not inviting. However much they may learn un
der forced pressure in the class room, they will miss a great |
deal of the beneficial maturing atmosphere which is an im
portant part of university life.
It they graduate in four years they can hardly be as
fully matured as the normal student; they cannot have a
well-rounded cultural foundation.
