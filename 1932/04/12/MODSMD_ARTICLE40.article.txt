# BULL SESSION
## COLUMBIA—EX-GEM 
### 
While Stanford basks its erges- |
terol in the sunlight to create more I
vitamin "D," Columbia University !
students are raising one of the big- 1
gest rumpuses or rumpi that has yet |
to bieak into print. It all happened l
when Reed Harris —their editor—
criticized an eating hall on the !
campus. The Dean, for this offense, j
promptly expelled the editor and j
just as promptly the student body
went on a strike.
There are two kinds of strikes,
and the Columbia student body went
on the other kind. They have ac
tively besieged the campus. There
have been fights; eggings are fre
quent; paint, water, and a little
blood have been spilled. Somebody
released some tear gas and even
riot squads have been called. The
strikers are fighting for the rein
statement of Harris —who has with
drawn from the campus. He merely
contents himself with issuing state
ments which further enrage an al
ready outraged Dean.
If the action had happened in
some small sectarian school in the 1
Middlewest, nobody would have !
been suprised. To have it happen in
mighty Columbia —the liberal col
lege located in the Metropolis of i
America —leaves everyone gasping. 1
The nation cannot believe that
Nicholas Murray Butler—one of the
loudest godfathers of liberalism — j
would permit such a thing to be- 1
smirch the glory that was Columbia. !
Of course, the Dean claims that the j
editor was mistaken in his facts and !
with that simple excuse feels he has '
justified his action.

J Obviously if some superior an- 1
' thority is to decide the validity of
j facts, freedom of the press becomes
' nothing hut a very pale and anemic
, shadow. That an administration
I which would have convulsed itself
j with cynical laughter at the thought
! of granting the President of the U.S.
j the right to banish recalcitrant edi
j tors could stoop to such shame
j faced action is inconceivable.
This is just another example of ;
the inconsistency of college admin
istration. They teach students to
face the truth; and then when they
try to, in some little thing which ;
places red ants in the administra
j tion's pants—down comes the fist of 1
I authority. If Harris had claimed that
1 the Farm Board was inefficient,
| nothing would have been done; but l
that a University dining hall was
i inefficient was unbearable.
Butler, in his innumerable com- i
mencement addresses, has probably I
often spoke on the place of the- 1
j youth of the land as the ones who !
will lead the way to better and |
1 more beautiful heights. Yet, in his
own college, he has a fighting editor i
who uncovered football profession
alism —and fearlessly attacked it —
against physical threats; a man who
1 thinks he sees corrupt conditions in
a dining hall and lashes out against
it—yet this man is taken by his
collar and bounced.
Some students on the campus j
found a statue of "The Thinker," |
gagged it, labeled it "He Can't Think '
Out Loud." That was to the point, j

While Stanford basks its erges- |
terol in the sunlight to create more I
vitamin "D," Columbia University !
students are raising one of the big- 1
gest rumpuses or rumpi that has yet |
to bieak into print. It all happened l
when Reed Harris —their editor—
criticized an eating hall on the !
campus. The Dean, for this offense, j
promptly expelled the editor and j
just as promptly the student body
went on a strike.
There are two kinds of strikes,
and the Columbia student body went
on the other kind. They have ac
tively besieged the campus. There
have been fights; eggings are fre
quent; paint, water, and a little
blood have been spilled. Somebody
released some tear gas and even
riot squads have been called. The
strikers are fighting for the rein
statement of Harris —who has with
drawn from the campus. He merely
contents himself with issuing state
ments which further enrage an al
ready outraged Dean.
If the action had happened in
some small sectarian school in the 1
Middlewest, nobody would have !
been suprised. To have it happen in
mighty Columbia —the liberal col
lege located in the Metropolis of i
America —leaves everyone gasping. 1
The nation cannot believe that
Nicholas Murray Butler—one of the
loudest godfathers of liberalism — j
would permit such a thing to be- 1
smirch the glory that was Columbia. !
Of course, the Dean claims that the j
editor was mistaken in his facts and !
with that simple excuse feels he has '
justified his action.

J Obviously if some superior an- 1
' thority is to decide the validity of
j facts, freedom of the press becomes
' nothing hut a very pale and anemic
, shadow. That an administration
I which would have convulsed itself
j with cynical laughter at the thought
! of granting the President of the U.S.
j the right to banish recalcitrant edi
j tors could stoop to such shame
j faced action is inconceivable.
This is just another example of ;
the inconsistency of college admin
istration. They teach students to
face the truth; and then when they
try to, in some little thing which ;
places red ants in the administra
j tion's pants—down comes the fist of 1
I authority. If Harris had claimed that
1 the Farm Board was inefficient,
| nothing would have been done; but l
that a University dining hall was
i inefficient was unbearable.
Butler, in his innumerable com- i
mencement addresses, has probably I
often spoke on the place of the- 1
j youth of the land as the ones who !
will lead the way to better and |
1 more beautiful heights. Yet, in his
own college, he has a fighting editor i
who uncovered football profession
alism —and fearlessly attacked it —
against physical threats; a man who
1 thinks he sees corrupt conditions in
a dining hall and lashes out against
it—yet this man is taken by his
collar and bounced.
