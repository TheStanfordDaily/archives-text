"WESTWARD PASSAGE" by Mar
garet Ayer Barnes. Houghton
Mifi'lin Co. $2.50.
In "Westward Passage," her fol
low-up novel to "Years of Grace,"
Pulitzer* Prize novel, Margaret Ayer
Barnes presents an intimate study
of a twice-married lady and her
waverings between the first, whom
she had almost forgotten, and the
second, whom she took for granted.
In the ten years that had followed
their sudden divorce, Olivia Otten
dorf and Nicholas Allen had never
met, and Olivia had been happy in
her married life with patient and
devoted Harry Ottendorf. Then,
suddenly, homeward bound from a
trip abroad, she met Nick again and
found that he had emerged from
stormy years a distinguished and
sought-after literary figure.
Things happen quickly aboard the
ocean-liner, and within twenty
four hours after their landing,
Olivia, who has not seen her second
husband yet, agrees to go away to
Vermont with Nick. She is afraid
to tell her daughter and her hus
band, and goes away with those
clouds over her happiness. The con
clusion is the only new twist to the

I plot, and it is well-handled. —E.C.
AT THE ORPHEUM, San Francisco.
"Girl Crazy" with the combined
; antics of Wheeler and Woolsey ca
| vorts across the Orpheum screen
this week in one of the silliest and
most hilarious bits of musical pic
| tures seen in recent months.
Little Mitzi Green comes to the
! front several times to steal the per
! formance with her "imitations"
I which are really worth the price of
I admission. Her take-off of George
Arliss is especially lifelike.
Although not at their best, the
| WW. combination do everything to
| turn a dude ranch into a veritable
| madhouse of laughs. Dorothy Lee
ably helps in this, and her dance
| number with Woolsey was a clever
j example of what love can do.
Taxicab driver, sheriff, and gam
: bier—that's what the boys portray,
i The ranch idea is well carried out,
| and although the dangerous sheriff
| killer is overplayed, this musical
i comedy, adopted from the stage re
j vue of that name, provides an amus
, ing evening's entertainment. An
I S. S. Van Dine murder short com
| pletes the bill with other comedy
I numbers. —S.B.
