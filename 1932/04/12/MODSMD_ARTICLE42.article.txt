# Campus Opinion
## TO BE OR NOT TO BE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is time for the Executive Com
mittee to take definite action. For
the last few years, each year the
question has come before the com
mittee whether the concert series
shall continue on this campus or not.
The question has arisen, not be
cause the concert series has ever
cost the A.S.S.U. any money, but
because of the fear that it might do
so. And now, this year, because that
fear may be realized, the Executive?
Committee is likely to arbitrarily
rule the series off the campus.
Everyone realizes that this is a hard
year. Just because it is, why cause
the discontinuance of such a worth
while opportunity as the concerts?
Musically, they are our only cultural
opportunity.

The series has had to work under
a great disadvantage because of the
continued uncertainty of Executive
Committee action. Why not work
out some plan of trial for a definite
period of time—say three years—in
which to give a working chance to
those students who take over the
responsibility of the series? End
this uncertainty!
The committee wants student
opinion. The only way, at this late
date, in which to voice an opinion
in favor of the series, is to attend
the concert Wednesday evening.
Show your interest. Show the
Executive Committee that you want
the concerts to continue on this
campus.
