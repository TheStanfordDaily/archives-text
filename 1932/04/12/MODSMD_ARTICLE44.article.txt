# MAUDE ADAMS TO PLAY 'PORTIA' THIS WEEK AT COLUMBIA
## 
### 
Maude Adams, whose return to i
the stage this season has created :
nation-wide interest and expecta- !
tion opened a six-night engagement i
with Otis Skinner, her co-star, in a
modern version of Shakespeare's :
"The Merchant of Venice" at the
Columbia Thfcatre in San Francisco 1
last night.
Maude Adams is the first person !
in two hundred years to have J
changed the accepted interpretation j
of Portia. Shylock's character has j
received various interpretations at
the hands of different actors, but ;
no one thought to change Portia, j
She remained a woman who went to
a court to play a clever trick coached
and rehearsed by Dr. Bellario, a
great lawyer.
The new reading of Portia shows
a woman of nobility of purpose and j
keen intelligence, able by means of
her own insight, to discover the '
flaw in the bond; a Portia of mercy, J
her goal is never the undoing of
Shylock; she is fighting with all her
resources for Antonio's life.
Sympathy is focused not on the
predicament of Shylock but on the
deliverance of Antonio. Miss Adams' !
interpretation of the play is hailed
as a new conception to interest stu
dents and lovers of Shakespeare.

A class in television has been
added to the U.C. extension course.
