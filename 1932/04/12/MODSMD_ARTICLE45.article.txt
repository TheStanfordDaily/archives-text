"I think the 880 record would be
easier to break again than the 440,"
Etn Eastman said yesterday, but
thai was his only response when
asked if he expects to lower either
of the two new world records he
set within the brief space of two
weeks.
He prefers to run his first love,
(lie quarter-mile, but admits that
this may be merely because he
hasn't had enough experience in the
half.
"I didn't feel very tired after the
880 Saturday," he remarked yester
day. "I think you can come back
more quickly after the half than
after the 440, but I may have that
impression merely because I didn't
have to worry about close compe
tition Saturday."
The prospect of running both
the 400 and 800 meter races in
the Olympic Games doesn't
worry Eastman so much as the
1.C.4-A., where he may have to
tackle the hall'- and quarter
mile events on the same day.
"In the Olympic Games you run
400 meter trials and finals for three
flays," he said, "and then rest a day
or two an dstart in on the 800."
Asked if he thought the Olympic
events would bother him, he re
plied, "I don't think there is enough
difference between the yardage and
metric distances to make any trou
ble. You don't have to change pace."
"The curiosity of a woman
wrought Adam's fall in the Gar
den »if Eden,'' says Leonard
llorwin, of the Intercollegiate
Olympic Games News Service.
''And true to tradition, a
woman's curiosity was behind
the world's first recorded "gate
crashing" incident which oc
curred during the ancient Olym
pic Games.
"Pherenice of Athens was the
original gate-crasher; and it was
all her son's fault, just as the
male is always at fault. Phere
nice's son, Pisidorus, was famous
for his Olympic victories. Phere
nice, who by reason of the an
cient rules debarring female
spectators had never witnessed
his exploits, was tempted into
trouble that she might even for
a moment bask in the glory of
her son.
"She disguised herself in the
rude garments of a peasant and
entered the ancient State (held).
"As per usual, Pisidorus won.
And poor Pherenice, forgetfully
hurrying down to the field to shower
affection upon her son, was dis
covered and rudely booted off the
field—the original gate-crasher thus
crashing with forced haste into the
weeds on the fields of Olympia.
"After that, Olympic athletes had
to appear in the nude, thus obvi
a'ing the danger of female gate
crashing.
"And now," concludes Horwin, "if
Pherenice of Athens could get
Charon to ferry her back across the
Styx for this year's Olympics, she
would be flabbergasted to find more
than 250 of her sex pouring in from
all corners of the earth to form the
largest feminine group ever to ap
pear in the Modern Olympiads."

largest feminine group ever to ap
pear in the Modern Olympiads."
"I think the 880 record would be
easier to break again than the 440,"
Etn Eastman said yesterday, but
thai was his only response when
asked if he expects to lower either
of the two new world records he
set within the brief space of two
weeks.
He prefers to run his first love,
(lie quarter-mile, but admits that
this may be merely because he
hasn't had enough experience in the
half.
"I didn't feel very tired after the
880 Saturday," he remarked yester
day. "I think you can come back
more quickly after the half than
after the 440, but I may have that
impression merely because I didn't
have to worry about close compe
tition Saturday."
The prospect of running both
the 400 and 800 meter races in
the Olympic Games doesn't
worry Eastman so much as the
1.C.4-A., where he may have to
tackle the hall'- and quarter
mile events on the same day.
"In the Olympic Games you run
400 meter trials and finals for three
flays," he said, "and then rest a day
or two an dstart in on the 800."
Asked if he thought the Olympic
events would bother him, he re
plied, "I don't think there is enough
difference between the yardage and
metric distances to make any trou
ble. You don't have to change pace."
"The curiosity of a woman
wrought Adam's fall in the Gar
den »if Eden,'' says Leonard
llorwin, of the Intercollegiate
Olympic Games News Service.
''And true to tradition, a
woman's curiosity was behind
the world's first recorded "gate
crashing" incident which oc
curred during the ancient Olym
pic Games.
"Pherenice of Athens was the
original gate-crasher; and it was
all her son's fault, just as the
male is always at fault. Phere
nice's son, Pisidorus, was famous
for his Olympic victories. Phere
nice, who by reason of the an
cient rules debarring female
spectators had never witnessed
his exploits, was tempted into
trouble that she might even for
a moment bask in the glory of
her son.
"She disguised herself in the
rude garments of a peasant and
entered the ancient State (held).
"As per usual, Pisidorus won.
And poor Pherenice, forgetfully
hurrying down to the field to shower
affection upon her son, was dis
covered and rudely booted off the
field—the original gate-crasher thus
crashing with forced haste into the
weeds on the fields of Olympia.
"After that, Olympic athletes had
to appear in the nude, thus obvi
a'ing the danger of female gate
crashing.
"And now," concludes Horwin, "if
Pherenice of Athens could get
Charon to ferry her back across the
Styx for this year's Olympics, she
would be flabbergasted to find more
than 250 of her sex pouring in from
all corners of the earth to form the
largest feminine group ever to ap
pear in the Modern Olympiads."
