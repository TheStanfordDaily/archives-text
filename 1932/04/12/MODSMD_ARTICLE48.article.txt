# Little Big Meet May Bare Future Card [not clear]
## FROSH TRACKMEN PROMISE THRILLS IN FRIDAY'S MEET Harold Branting Foremost U.C. Threat In 100-Yard Dash, High Jump 
### Albert Guerard 
Stanford's freshman track "stars j
are a tight-lipped, grim-faced bunch
of men these days, as they go about j
their task of conditioning tor their j
final meet of the year against the j
California freshmen. The Little Big j
Meet is only four days away, and j
since California has registered a I
more impressive practice season rec- J
ord, the Indians realize that they
are due for some big improvement,
if they wish to put over their tenth
victory over the Golden Bears in as
many years.
In former years, Little Big Meets
have always been close, hard-fought
affairs, but this year's clash, which
will be held on the Stanford Oval,
outclasses all former freshman duals
for prospective individual battles,
and total lack of any real dope on
the relative strength of the two j
teams.
Although California defeated the j
San Francisco All-Stars and the
Alameda All-Stars, and Stanford |
lost to these same teams, all of the
meets in which these teams com- ,
peted have been close.
Branting Threat
The outstanding Blue and Gold j
athlete is one Harold Branting, cap- j
tain of the Bear Cub crew, who has j
already exceeded the existing Little j
Big Meet broad jump record by i
some eleven inches. Branting's best
mark of 23 feet, 5 1-2 inches is a
good two feet better than any jump
ing done by his teammates Tread- j
Avell and Gearhart, or Kelly, Bowles, |
and Peters of Stanford. Branting, j
in addition, has been winning 100- j
yard dashes in 10 flat consistently, |
and may hand A1 Blackman his first j
defeat of the year. The Branting vs. j
Blackman 100 should be but one of j
many stirring duels in the track I
events.
Because of an almost certain fif
teen or more points in the shot and j
discus, the Bears enjoy a big ad-1
vantage over the Indians in the field i
events. The javelin thi-ow may give j
Stanford a chance to stage something!
of a comeback, however, as Beatty, !
Sales, and Wyman have all exceeded !
the best marks of Darracq and Mac
key, the Bear spear-tossers.
Mackey Versatile
This Mackey seems to be the
Ã¼biquitous star of the Bear track- j
men, as he runs the hurdles, high j
jumps, broad jumps, and throws the
shot, discus, and javelin with equal,
facility. He may repeat Dave Pack- J
ard's "iron man" act of scoring j
eighteen points in four events in i
last year's Little Big Meet.
If Mackey stays out of the high i
jump, since the shot and discus are !
his best events, California will be:
represented in this event by Dave
Meek, who cleared G feet, 1 inch. ;
and Treadwell, who ranges in abil
ity between 5 feet and 5 feet, G
inches.
Mackey's best event is the discus, j
the Bear tosser having turned in a !
mark of 133 feet for the platter j
throw. Right now, many of Bill El- j
lington's worries are centered j
around possible second- and third- ;
place discus throwers. At the pres- j
ent time Peters and Rot her t, who j
also pole vault, are the outstand- '
ing candidates.
