# CARD POLO TEAM HELD THREAT IN SAN MATEO LOW GOAL TOURNAMENT
## 
### Bill Myers 
Stanford's polo team will enter the 1
San Mateo Low-Goal Tournament '
this Friday, Captain Dick Gordon, j
polo coach, announced yesterday, j
The tournament is open to all j
teams having a handicap of eight j
goals or less. The Cardinal outfit '
is not officially handicapped, and j
will carry a straight four-goal rat- j
ing.
Other entries in the tournament i
have not yet been definitely an- i
nounced. Several Peninsula teams j
arc expected to be among the con- j
tenders.
Chances for the Redshirts to end i
up with the top teams look fairly J
promising. After a somewhat color
less fall season, the Cards outfit fin
ally began to click as a team by the
end of winter quarter. Their last I
match saw them humble the mighty '
Arizona Wildcats at Tucson. Ari- !
zona is generally rated as the sec
ond best college team in the coun
try. • • j
Probable line-up this Friday will
be with Pete Gillham and Rufus
Spalding at the one and two po
sitions. Playing back at three and
four will be Pete Lewis and Bruce j
Fleming. Malone will go along as J
substitute.

| Fleming and Lewis make excel
-1 lent defensive men. Opposing riders
| find it hard to get through these
j two. Spalding seems to lit in better
j at number two where he has been
i playing for the last two months, and
| should account for most of the goals.
I Gillham is an expert at riding off
i the opposing number four, making
| an excellent partner for the sharp
; shooting Spalding.
