# CARD HER POLO STOCK BOOMS ON RETURN OF STARS
## Ted Wiget and Frank Booth Back to Farm After Eastern Invasion 
### 
Water polo stock went up any j
number of points with the arrival
'011 the campus yesterday of Captain
! Austin Clapp. Clapp's return to ;
| practice strengthens the varsity team |
! almost to its full power, with Ted |
i Wiget, who is not enrolled in school j
j this quarter, the only missing mem- j
, ber. Capable Gordy Graves is fill- i
j ing his place.
Wiget and Frank Booth returned j
to the campus Thursday, and were I
seen at water polo practice the same j
afternoon. Both had just finished j
I a series of events in the east, as j
; had Clapp. At the national A.A.U. I
! championships in New Haven last |
j week, Wiget was the only point- j
| scorer from Stanford. He repre-1
; sented the Athens Club, of Oakland,'
I while Booth and Clapp swam for i
j the Hollywood A.C.
Second in 500-Yard
Wiget's glory came in the 500- ,
| yard and 220-yard races. In the i
I former, he finished second to Bus- J
ter Crabbe in a elose fight, followed !
I by the two Hawaiian brothers, Mai- j
• ola and Manuela Kalili. In the lat- !
ter, he failed to beat out the Kal
ili brothers, who finished first and j
second, followed by Wiget.
Clapp, who was defending cham
pion in the 550-yard race, failed to !
i qualify for the finals in this event, j
I but did get to the final stage of the !
j 330-yard medley, though failing to j
1 place. His return to the campus to- |
'day still gives him an opportunity!
to enter the Pacific Coast Confer- \
ence Intercollegiate Championships, I
i otherwise known as the Minor |
Sports Carnival, at U.S.C. Friday and !
Saturday.
U.S.C. Contest
It is probable that both Booth and |
Clapp will enter only one event each j
; in the comparatively assured swim- |
ming meet, saving themselves for the
more doubtful water polo contest
1 with U.S.C. Wiget's loss makes the
i outcome of this game even more
dubious. Booth has strengthened the
j offense considerably by his presence;
! the defense is already good, and will
probably improve before the week
■ end.
Coach Thornton declares he will
drive the team hard in scrimmage
during the early part of the week,
easing up on Thursday in prepara
tion for the preliminaries the next
i day.

Wiget and Frank Booth returned j
to the campus Thursday, and were I
seen at water polo practice the same j
afternoon. Both had just finished j
I a series of events in the east, as j
; had Clapp. At the national A.A.U. I
! championships in New Haven last |
j week, Wiget was the only point- j
| scorer from Stanford. He repre-1
; sented the Athens Club, of Oakland,'
I while Booth and Clapp swam for i
j the Hollywood A.C.
Second in 500-Yard
Wiget's glory came in the 500- ,
| yard and 220-yard races. In the i
I former, he finished second to Bus- J
ter Crabbe in a elose fight, followed !
I by the two Hawaiian brothers, Mai- j
• ola and Manuela Kalili. In the lat- !
ter, he failed to beat out the Kal
ili brothers, who finished first and j
second, followed by Wiget.
Clapp, who was defending cham
pion in the 550-yard race, failed to !
i qualify for the finals in this event, j
I but did get to the final stage of the !
j 330-yard medley, though failing to j
1 place. His return to the campus to- |
'day still gives him an opportunity!
to enter the Pacific Coast Confer- \
ence Intercollegiate Championships, I
i otherwise known as the Minor |
Sports Carnival, at U.S.C. Friday and !
Saturday.
U.S.C. Contest
It is probable that both Booth and |
Clapp will enter only one event each j
; in the comparatively assured swim- |
ming meet, saving themselves for the
more doubtful water polo contest
1 with U.S.C. Wiget's loss makes the
i outcome of this game even more
dubious. Booth has strengthened the
j offense considerably by his presence;
! the defense is already good, and will
probably improve before the week
■ end.
Coach Thornton declares he will
drive the team hard in scrimmage
during the early part of the week,
easing up on Thursday in prepara
tion for the preliminaries the next
i day.
Water polo stock went up any j
number of points with the arrival
'011 the campus yesterday of Captain
! Austin Clapp. Clapp's return to ;

! almost to its full power, with Ted |
i Wiget, who is not enrolled in school j
j this quarter, the only missing mem- j
