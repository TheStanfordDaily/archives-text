Stanford faces the coming dry j
season amply supplied with water ]
for domestic and irrigation pur- j
poses.
A survey of the water situation
yesterday showed that approximate
ly 600,000,000 gallons are in storage
in Folt and Searsville lakes, despite
the fact that irrigation has been
under way since the first of March
all over the Campus. Los Trancos i
is contributing to the supply in Felt j
lake at the rate of 600 gallons a j
minute.
Drainage of Lagunita will prob- j
ably occur earlier this year than is i
customary, due to the prolonged j
draught of the past two months, ac- j
cording to James W. McDonnell, as- j
sistant superintendent of buildings!
and grounds. Without fresh water
coming in from San Francisquito
creek, Lagunita tends to stagnate
rapidly. The lowering of the water
in Lagunita at the present time is j
due solely to seepage.
