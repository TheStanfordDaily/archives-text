### 
Hammer and Coflui meted out the
severest punishment at its command
yesterday when it sentenced Don
Cameron to one year of hard labor
as editor of the Stanford Chaparral.
The charge was criminal mainten
ance of drivel.
Elected to the Society in 1929,
Cameron has been managing editor
of its publication for the last two
years, and his appointment to the
editorship makes him president of
Hammer and Coffin for 1932-33. He
will be the forty-second "Old Boy"
in a long line extending back to 1899
when the magazine was first estab
lished.
Opera Co-author
Cameron's infamies have been
varied and numerous during his
three years here, his worst blunder
probably being his connection with
that scandal that shook the campus
last year—the Junior Opera. Cur
rent rumor has it that he was co
author of that particularly libelous
piece of work. But it wasn't until
the production of the tragedy itself,
called '"Proletariat Plus" for want of
a better name, that Cameron's asso
ciation with the Communistic party
was fully realized.
At last, when all was said and
done the Stanford Dramatic Council
claimed that he had defrauded them
of prize money to the sum of $50.
Econ. Major
An economics major, Cameron has
devoted a great deal of time both
to journalism and athletics. Besides
being on the Chappie staff he is
senior basketball manager for next
year. Interested in advertising,
Cameron has established a record
for awards in advertising-copy con
tests.
He succeeds. Berk Anthony as edi
tor of the Stanford Chaparral.
