# CARD SPEAKERS BOW TO U.C. IN JOFFRE DEBATE
## Leonard Bloom In Second Place, Mary-Katherine Morris Third 
### 
Second and third places in a field
of six speakers were awarded to
Stanford orators last night in the
annual J off re Medal debate with
the University of California, held on
the Berkeley campus. Sidney Rudy
of California won the historic medal
in a six-sided argument that was
marked by lack of the usual sar
casm, humor, and play of person
alities.
"Leonard Bloom, second, and
Mary-Katherine Morris, third, of
Stanford," were the words read from
the judges' decision. The subject,
picked by a committee of professors
two hours before the contest, was,
"Resolved, that the agreement of
France to the cancellation of repara
tions is essential to world recovery."
Bloom Excels
Bloom's rebuttal was character
ized by Leland Chapin, Stanford de
bate coach, as "a masterpiece."
Mary-K. Morris and one Califor
nia speaker defended France; the
other four debaters sided against
France.
Rudy, winning California speaker,
argued that the reparations were
based on a part 'of the Versailles
Treaty blaming Germany entirely
for the war, a theory that "has since
been disproved." He said that in
order to restore world economic
confidence, the debts would have to
be cancelled.
Morris Dramatic
Miss Morris, gesturing dramati
cally as the attorney for France,
maintained that the way out for
Germany was not cancellation of the
debts, but an indefinite moratorium.
She said that France was not re
sponsible for Germany's plight, but
rather the foolish financial policy of
the German government.
Bloom reasoned that France must
answer for imposing an unjust
treaty and reducing Germany to
impotence-. He discussed the point
that Germany fears France, and
France, knowing that, will not dis
arm.
Botasof vs. France
Isador Botasof, the third Stanford
speaker, evinced an argument simi
lar to the winner's. He said that
"France is temperamental: it is 95
per cent temper, and 5 per cent
niental." Botasof pointed out that
it is causing world-wide hard times
by calling in loans, and that in her
desire to humble Germany she is
preventing the world's economic re
covery.
Jakabus Brock, a blind California
speaker, was led on the stage and
gave an impassioned, emotional ap
peal against the policy of France.
