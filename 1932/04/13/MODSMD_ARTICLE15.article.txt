# Gray Predicts Crisis In Shakespeare Production
## 
### Harrison Foss 
A crisis in Stanford dramatic his
tory is anticipated by Professor H.
D. Gray of the English department
in the forthcoming production of
"Romeo and Juliet."
"I am looking forward with a
great deal of interest to 'Romeo and
Juliet' for more than one reason,"
he said yesterday. "In the first place
I have never seen a good amateur
production of the tragedy, but am
still willing to be convinced that it
can be done; and secondly, 'Romeo
and Juliet's' success or failure is
bound to have a great effect on the
future of campus dramatics."
But so jovial is Professor Gray,
that impressions rather than state
ments rire the things that one car
ries away after talking with him. It
was 25 years ago that he was di-

jrector of Stanford dramatics him
self, and naturally the progress of
I the work here has been of constant
| interest to him. He thinks that Har
old Helvenston, the present director,
deserves a great deal of credit for
being able to carry on at all after
the success of Gordon Davis on the
j campus.
James Lyons' portrayal of Romeo
i will interest him particularly, for
jhe thinks that the success or failâ€”
Jure of the play depends on how
I this part is read. " 'Romeo and Ju
j liet' is not a success on the modern
stage because we do not go to the
i theatre for the same reason that the
| Elizabethans did. The sheer beauty
of the poetry was enough for them,
and the fundamental weaknesses of
the 'Romeo and Juliet' plot were
not considered.'
