tours of the United States and guest
appearances with leading American
opera companies, in addition to his

John Charles Thomas, one of
America's foremost baritones, will
sing an international group of songs
in the Pavilion tonight at 8:20
o'clock, appearing as the last of the
guest artists for the A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series this season.
Because of his popularity, Thomas
has been unofficially dubbed "our
singing ambassador to Belgium,"
and is credited with no small share
in welding together the bonds of
friendship between that country and
the As leading bari
tone of Covent Gardens, London, and
of the Royal Opera House, Brussels,
he has achieved unusual success
abroad and been widely accepted,
which is an honor not given every
American singer.
Trained in America
Although his operatic debut was
made on foreign soil, the famous
baritone is a true American prod
uct, both by birth and by training
and education. He devotes part of
each year to coast-to-coast concert
tours of the United States and guest
appearances with leading American
opera companies, in addition to his
foreign performances.
Of the three fields of comic opera,
grand opera, and concert singing,
John Charles Thomas prefers the
latter ,because of the great variety
of moods the artist is called upon
to interpret in one well-chosen pro
gram.
