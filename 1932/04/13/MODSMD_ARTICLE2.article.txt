# SYMPATHY KEYNOTE OF MRS. BROWN'S DRAMATIC READING
## 
### 
Interpreting the life of Emily
Dickinson through Susan Glaspell's
Pulitzer Prize Drama, "Allison's
House," Mrs. Hugh Brown of Palo
Alto gave a dramatic reading last
night in the Assembly Hall.
Excellent in emotional scenes, Mrs.
Brown read the delicate play with
extreme sympathy. Her interpreta
tion of men's roles was hardly com
parable to her work through the
characters of the aged sister, Agatha,
who hoarded the poet's secrets, and
of the young and beautiful Elsa, who
defied the family traditions for
love.
Without the aid of scenery or sup
porting characters, Mrs. Brown's
portrayal was unusually pictorial,
but interest in plot and character
contrasts outreached the descriptive
phases.
Centered around the unpublished
poems found after the poet's death,
the family controversy over giving
the verses to the world is the basis
of the play. It combines excellent
dramatic qualities of unity of lime
and place, with expert character
drawings.
International Relations Club will
unit its Thursday meeting, in order
to attend the special lecture of Pan-
Americanism by Professor Percy A.
Martin Thursday night.
