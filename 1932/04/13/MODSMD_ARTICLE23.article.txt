| DEFUSING to accept the resignation of tlie three student members who
were forced to withdraw by the Interfralernity Council, the Inter
fraternity Board of Control, at a meeting last night, changed the penalt>
imposed on the houses for illegal rushing to allow rushing and pledging
of members of the Class of 1935 at the opening of college next fall
quarter instead of the lirst of November. It also limited the number of
men that any house could pledge from this class to ten.

*> The new student representatives
j of the Board voted in at the last
meeting of the Council were al
lowed a vole, however, as well as
the three members who had re
signed, giving nine undergraduate
! votes. All the resolutions were
| passed unanimously, including the
j one refusing to seat the new mem
-1 bers.

This plan, it was felt, would solve
! the housing problem yet still penal
| ize the fraternities by not allowing
! rushing this spring. The action of
the Board has yet to be passed on by
Acting-President Robert E. Swain;
! an early approval of the resolutions
! is expected.
The following resolutions were
I passed unanimously by the Board:
i 1. That all fraternities without
proper bookkeeping and auditing
i systems be required to install them
; at once, and that no fraternity be
: permitted to rush or pledge any
J men until such bookkeeping and
, auditing systems are installed and
i in operation, as determined by the
i Board of Control.
Must Clear Debts
2. That no fraternity be permitted
i to rush or pledge any men from the
Class of 1935 until all its accounts

■ Auditing Committee of the Board,
and approved by the Board, or pro
vision, acceptable to the Board of
Control, is made for their payment,
i 3. That the number of men which
' may be pledged by any one fra
! ternity from the Class of 1935, prior
i to October, 1933, be limited to 10.
Ban Present Hushing
4. That rushing and pledging of
; the members of the Class of 1935,
| subject to the provisions of the
I above, take place immediately after
| the opening of college next fall
! quarter; There shall be no rushing
i of such class this quarter.
5. That, beginning with the next
academic year (1932-1933) no fra
! ternity be permitted to pledge any
men unless all its accounts receiv
