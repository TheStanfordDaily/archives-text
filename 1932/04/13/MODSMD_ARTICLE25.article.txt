# PITY BOB BOYLE
## 
### 
Mr. Bob Boyle is a most unfortunate person. He is the
other candidate who is running against Orv Mohler, famous i
loolhall player and baseball star, for the presidency of the j
t'.S.C. student body, the idea of a comparatively unknown
competing against one of the most rotogravured athletes j
in the country for the position of Head Man at the Califor
nia Athletic Club is absurd.
Mr. Bovle's consenting to enter the lists against a fleet I
broken-field runner in the face of a certain and overwhelm
ing defeat tit the polls marks him as either a very brave
man or a very foolish one- The Daily wishes to extend
heartfelt sympathy to Mr. Boyle in his misfortune.
At many colleges in this country, not excepting Stan- j
lord, the competency to filling a political olfiec is measured
by the chest expansion of Ihe candidate, his balling aver
age, his speed on the track, in short, his physiological struc
ture below the neck; what it is like above is irrelevant and
immaterial.
However, now and again, whether through intent or
mistake, someone who is not prominent in sports manages
to sneak into some ollicc, to the surprise of everyone.
But for a non-athlete to be so presumptions as to run
against an All-American for the chief office of an organi
zation which is the Mecca of physical speed and brawn
borders on absurdity.
Good luck, Mr. Boyle. Although your cause is a worthy
one, you should be thankful to escape lynching for daring
to oppose a local idol.
