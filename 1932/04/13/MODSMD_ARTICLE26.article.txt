# A 						GOOD CONCERT TONIGHT
## 
### 
With Jolni Charles Thomas as tonight's attraction, the
Concert Series management is offering the campus enter- j
tainmenl which amply justifies the recurring plea for more
student support. From an artistic standpoint the series is,
always worth while, hut it has not always satisfied the
musical preferences of the Stanford student, and this has
heen one of the strongest criticisms leveled against its con-i
tinuance.
Tonight the program is to he given by an artist whose:
appeal is to the popular taste as well as to the musically
educated. Anyone who has heard Thomas, whether in per
son or on the radio, can testify that his voice has a color;
and pleasing quality at least equal to that of Lawrence'
Tibbett, who made a smash hit here last year.
Selections listed for this evening include songs calcu
lated to please music lovers of all sorts, but the high spot
for most of the audience will probably be the next-to-last
number, "Home On the Range," a western song of grade A
quality. Any rough who fails to be on hand, if only for this
one number, will have cause to regret it.
The threatened deficit of the series is a well known pos
sibility; a small crowd tonight may very easily result in the (
abandonment of the concerts next year. If the students
want to insure the preservation of these events for the fu
ture they must turn out'in strength for this one. If they
feel that they are not worth continuing, they can stay away
and thereby aid in dealing a serious blow to the whole j
plan.
Hut the student who does not attend tonight merely
because he does not expect an enjoyable entertainment will
be very foolish, to say the least.
