Inconsistency lias probably tripped, tangled, and killed
more authority than any other single thing. In view of this
fad, several professors of this university had better look to
their laurels before they some day lind themselves totally
bereft of influence with students.
Few are those enrolled here who have never been in at
least one class per quarter in which, some poor tuition
paver is not upbraided for being late to class. Professors
will point out that since we do have a class-attending sys
tem of education, punctuality is necessary for its smooth
operation. And they are right.
Yet those same educators who bewail the waste of their
own time by late-arriving students are often the type that
never consider that the knowledge-seeker's time is also
valuable, holding their classes from two to twenty minutes
after the period-ending bell has sounded.
Perhaps some of them are so utterly engrossed in the
mighty wisdom they are dispensing that they don't even
hear the bell. And there are probably a few who figure that
even if the class time is legally through there is really no
better place in all the world than their lecture rooms for
the knowledge-thirsty students to spend some of their spare
niomen Is.
And in 11 o'clocks, when the noon whistle blows, it
might be remembered that the undergraduate mind is tilled
with thoughts of food, leaving practically no room at all
for any juicy bits of information the professor might choose
to pass afterwards.
