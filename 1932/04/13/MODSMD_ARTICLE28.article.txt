# BULL SESSION
## NECKING AND ROMANCE 
### 
One oi' the most perturbing ques
tions in this generation is the rela
tive merits, demerits —position for
and of—that vague and hazy gener
ality termed necking. To those who
think it is something delinite, at
tempt a 'definition that will include
and exclude the right things. It is
because each person creates his
own definition that opinion on nock
ing is so varied. Up at Cal, the
seniors voted 178 to 15# that neck
ing was not essential to romance.
With the 178 we are not interested
because they agree with us; but the
150 who thought that romance with
out necking was impossible, deserve
attention. Especially, because the
opposite is probably true—that is
that necking automatically destroys
romance. I believe it was Socrates
who first realized that the best way
to stop an opponent in argument
was to ask for definitions—then
show that the definitions were not
fully inclusive. The definer would
eventually get disgusted and go
home or exhausted and go to sleep.
Socrates never lost an argument.
Necking demands defining—even
inadequate defining. It may be
called the practice of promiscuous
kissing and fondling based on exu
berance for the sex in general rather
than love for the individual in par
ticular. It is exclusively physical—
100 per cent non-spiritual—and in
finitely more basic in its appeal
than romance. All of tWs does not

I mean that it is disagreeable or
wicked. But its basis and nature
must be understood. It appeals to
the animal in us—or if that sounds
condemning-- then, it rests on un
restrained (or fairly unrestrained)
fundamental instincts or drives.
Romance, however, is the prod
uct of intellect and spirit (not of
course in the Conan Doyle sense).
II is at direct variance with the
intent and significance of necking.
The Pygmies have a counterpart for
necking—Joe and Josephine Nean
i derthal probably also indulged. Ro
' mance in contrast can only exist
among a civilized people—a highly
civilized people. It has no universal
appeal; not everybody even today
can begin to enjoy the finesse of its
subtlety—its elusive fragrance. Stark
physical appeal — like necking —
crushes it with consummate ease and
speed.
Romance is not completely devoid
of the physical by any means. But
it manifests the physical inhibited
|by feeling and exalted by intelli
gence. It represents a delicate pleas
ure—rarer by far than necking, but
of course lacking the latter's virile
appeal. If concrete proof is needed
to show that romance is independent
of necking as to origin and yet de
pendent on it for destruction—the
letters of '"Ellen Terry and George
Bernard Shaw" oiler that proof.
