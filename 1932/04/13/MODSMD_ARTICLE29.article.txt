THE MERCHANT OF VENICE—At
the Columbia Theatre, San Fran
cisco.
The return of Maude Adams
brought out a first-night audience
of old-timers to see her famous por
trayal of Portia and to applaud her
heartily more probably for being
Maude Adams than for her present
performance. Her voice is not too
even and she no longer moves with
ease, but Maude Adams is still the
Portia that Shakespeare must have
had in mind—a witty, attractive
girl—not the sententious, serious
minded young woman that most in
terpreters take her for. And in the
trial scene Maude Adams chooses to
presume that Portia happens upon
the weakness in Shylock's contract
through her own wit, not through
Ihe coaching of the invisible Bel
lario.
Otis Skinner is of course—Otis
Skinner. He is a thing apart, an iso
lated star in the skies of the legiti
mate stage. He should really never
be seen except by himself with a
host of unimportants to support him
as in "Kismet." Perhaps in respect
to Maude Adams he has managed to
subdue himself somewhat and in
consequence makes a first-rate Shy
lock and a better showing than he
ever made in "Kismet." He takes
appalling liberties with the lines
without making them too obvious.
The whole play was extraordinar
ily well cast particularly in the case
of Joseph Curtin as Launcelot
Gobbo. He plays this difficult minor
part as well as it has ever been
done.
The settings were good but not
startlingly so. In the trial scene a
special use of white light is made
which very successfully focuses at
tention on the important characters.
The costumes are excellent.
The play itself is well cut and
pieced together—the tedious parts

taken out and the sequence made
more logical.
If you were "conditioned" against
Shakespeare in your early youth,
beg, borrow, or steal a copy of the
"Merchant" and hie up to the City
and see how really amusing the
much-abused "bard" can be.
—S.C.A.
THE ALARM CLOCK—At the Al
cazar Theatre, San Francisco.
Kicking like a giraffe, funny
Charlotte Greenwood returns to San
Francisco in another hit, yea a riot.
Never as clever as "She Couldn't
Say No," her last play in the city,
"The Alarm Clock" is nevertheless
one of the screamingest shows that
has been hoLised in a Duffy theatre
for a good while.
The story concerns itself with a
hick family coming to live in New
York. The results are never excit
ing or convincing but always hu
morous. The success of Miss Green
wood is due in a large measure to
the fine support of Dale Winters and
Huntley Gordon. Charlotte's Rumba
is worth the price of admission.
Don't miss "The Alarm Clock,"
but you needn't hurry, as the en
thusiasm at the opening perform
ances indicate a good long run.

taken out and the sequence made
more logical.
If you were "conditioned" against
Shakespeare in your early youth,
beg, borrow, or steal a copy of the
"Merchant" and hie up to the City
and see how really amusing the
much-abused "bard" can be.

THE ALARM CLOCK—At the Al
cazar Theatre, San Francisco.
Kicking like a giraffe, funny
Charlotte Greenwood returns to San
Francisco in another hit, yea a riot.
Never as clever as "She Couldn't
Say No," her last play in the city,
"The Alarm Clock" is nevertheless
one of the screamingest shows that
has been hoLised in a Duffy theatre
for a good while.
The story concerns itself with a
hick family coming to live in New
York. The results are never excit
ing or convincing but always hu
morous. The success of Miss Green
wood is due in a large measure to
the fine support of Dale Winters and
Huntley Gordon. Charlotte's Rumba
is worth the price of admission.
Don't miss "The Alarm Clock,"
but you needn't hurry, as the en
thusiasm at the opening perform
ances indicate a good long run.

THE MERCHANT OF VENICE—At
the Columbia Theatre, San Fran
cisco.
The return of Maude Adams
brought out a first-night audience
of old-timers to see her famous por
trayal of Portia and to applaud her
heartily more probably for being
Maude Adams than for her present
performance. Her voice is not too
even and she no longer moves with
ease, but Maude Adams is still the
Portia that Shakespeare must have
had in mind—a witty, attractive
girl—not the sententious, serious
minded young woman that most in
terpreters take her for. And in the
trial scene Maude Adams chooses to
presume that Portia happens upon
the weakness in Shylock's contract
through her own wit, not through
Ihe coaching of the invisible Bel
lario.
Otis Skinner is of course—Otis
Skinner. He is a thing apart, an iso
lated star in the skies of the legiti
mate stage. He should really never
be seen except by himself with a
host of unimportants to support him
as in "Kismet." Perhaps in respect
to Maude Adams he has managed to
subdue himself somewhat and in
consequence makes a first-rate Shy
lock and a better showing than he
ever made in "Kismet." He takes
appalling liberties with the lines
without making them too obvious.
The whole play was extraordinar
ily well cast particularly in the case
of Joseph Curtin as Launcelot
Gobbo. He plays this difficult minor
part as well as it has ever been
done.
The settings were good but not
startlingly so. In the trial scene a
special use of white light is made
which very successfully focuses at
tention on the important characters.
The costumes are excellent.
The play itself is well cut and
pieced together—the tedious parts

taken out and the sequence made
more logical.
If you were "conditioned" against
Shakespeare in your early youth,
beg, borrow, or steal a copy of the
"Merchant" and hie up to the City
and see how really amusing the
much-abused "bard" can be.
