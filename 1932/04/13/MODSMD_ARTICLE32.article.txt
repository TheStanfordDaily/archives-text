AT SEA
My dear countrymen:
j We had another request to leave
| in a hurry, Monday, backed up ibis
i time by the BA.C. and a sheriff's j
badge. Having a particular loathing
for Devil's Island and the Palo Alto
i jail, we left. Somebody please send
1 us our toothbrush, which we ne- |
glected in the scramble. It might get
! lonesome, having been our constant
; companion for so many years.
If it hadn't been for Chappie, the
good Old Boy. we probably couldn't
have made this ship. But he's pretty
1 clever (you can just ask him. him
i self) and so we scrambled aboard at
the last minute, disguised as a sack
of Irish potatoes. Somebody please
! send us a passport. They're getting
1 kind of nasty about us not having
! any.
The people on board are nice but
1 sort of high-hat, not at all like t
Steenford gennemun and ladeez.
I They do not like beer or cords or
i water fights. Somebody please send j
[ us a monocle. We'll use it.
Everyone talks about world prob
lems and politics. Hardly any of
' them seem to appreciate the fact

that the Eastman whiz is an Alpha
Delt but that it's really too had be
cause rushing has been deferred till
fall quarter. Somebody please send
us a hook on "Important Facts to
Know About the Civilized World."
We'll pass it around on deck.
The food is very nice indeed.
Somebody please send us a frater
nity cook. This sudden change is
apt to unbalance us.
We've only gotten into the wrong
cabin by mistake three times so far.
Those three times will perhaps
stand out as high spots of the entire
trip, but we'll have to wait till we
get back to tell you about them. It
is kind of hard explaining these oc
currences to the steward, though.
Somebody please send us a Sigma
Chi to demonstrate how easily one
might just happen to get into the
wrong house once in a while—when
you have such close and agreeable
neighbors. This is a similar situa

' tion.
We humped into a whale just off
the Faralones, and had to wait and
watch him die; but we should reach
the Hawaiian Islands by Friday, and
will immediately wire our first in',-
pressiens. Somebody please send us
a can of dark brown shoe polish.
Windjammer never did like sun
baths. but must please Fashion's
fancy, even over here.
They are talking about having a
fancy dress the last night on
i ship, and we don't know very much
about such (bines. Somebody please
.send us either Ed Boyles or the cos
tume of h defeated candidate to the
throne at your own little Masque
Partie How far away all
those things seem to be, already.
Somebody send us a postage stamp.
Dear, dear . . . . W.

i farms are free of mortgage debt.

We've only gotten into the wrong

stand out as high spots of the entire

My dear countrymen:
j We had another request to leave
| in a hurry, Monday, backed up ibis
i time by the BA.C. and a sheriff's j
badge. Having a particular loathing
for Devil's Island and the Palo Alto
i jail, we left. Somebody please send
1 us our toothbrush, which we ne- |
glected in the scramble. It might get
! lonesome, having been our constant
; companion for so many years.
If it hadn't been for Chappie, the
good Old Boy. we probably couldn't
have made this ship. But he's pretty
1 clever (you can just ask him. him
i self) and so we scrambled aboard at
the last minute, disguised as a sack
of Irish potatoes. Somebody please
! send us a passport. They're getting
1 kind of nasty about us not having
! any.
The people on board are nice but
1 sort of high-hat, not at all like t
Steenford gennemun and ladeez.

i water fights. Somebody please send j
