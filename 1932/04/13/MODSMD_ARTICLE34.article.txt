HERE ON THE CAMPUS they
have a very fine system of reward
ing athletes for outstanding per
formances. When members of the
swimming team, for example, win
national titles, they present them
with Block "S" sweaters. And each
member of a tearv that wins a na
lional title usually gets his varsity
sweater.
Hut there is one team, whose
»nenil>t"rs are «>!' unusually high
cabin/*, which lias received
practically no attention so far.
It is the STANFORD RIFLE
TEAM.
As a team, it has won 39 out ef
4!) matches. It has beaten teams
all over the country. In the West
Point match, the lowest Stanford
man had a better score than
West Point's highest man.
The team has improved its score
from 1831 in an early match to 1936
in a late one. And the team that de
feated the Indians scored but 11122
points! That team represented Texas
A. and M.. where riHo shooting is a
major sport.
In a recent shoot, one of the mem
bers of the team lost a chance for a
trip to England this summer by one
point. But the man who won it had
to shoot a new world's record to get
the trip.
The team defeated Long Beach
for the state championship and it
also has the state individual title
holder.
The outstanding members through
out the season have been: J. Adams,
Harding, Pasco, Wilhelm, and
White. Of these, Harding and Adams
are given an excellent chance to
make the Olympic team.
Over at California the rifle
team members receive Circle "C"
awards for making the team.
And it is doubtful if their team
could stand up against the one
that is at present representing
Stanford.
It would look mighty queer to
place a man or two on the Olympic
team and have to admit that their
work received no notice in the uni
versity they represent. If lor no
other reason than the work that
Ihey have done as an intercollegiate
team they deserve some kind of
an award.
If Stanford's varsity baseball
team hasn't done anything else, it
has developed the best second base
man in the league to keep Stan- I
lord's name on the all-conference j
team, and has developed one of the j
best chuckers in Stan Anderson.
The league batting averages,
as released last Saturday, put
Yince Philippi at the top of the
list with an average of .450, I
about :i0 points ahead of the
field. The same afternoon he
poled out four more blows in
four times at bat. If he hits even
fairly well for the rest of the j
season he ought to hang on to
his present lead.
Anderson, last year's star fresh- j
man pitcher, has come along nicely, I
and will probably be near the top
when the averages finally come out. j
In fact, the big sophomore has been '
the only dependable chucker on the ;
-quad. He possesses nice speed, a ;
fair change of pace, and a good level
head. With reasonable support he |
-hould get through next year with- I
'Ut a defeat. —Bob Wade.

field. The same afternoon he
poled out four more blows in
four times at bat. If he hits even
fairly well for the rest of the j
season he ought to hang on to
his present lead.
Anderson, last year's star fresh- j
man pitcher, has come along nicely, I
and will probably be near the top
when the averages finally come out. j
In fact, the big sophomore has been '
the only dependable chucker on the ;
-quad. He possesses nice speed, a ;
fair change of pace, and a good level
head. With reasonable support he |

'Ut a defeat. —Bob Wade.
HERE ON THE CAMPUS they
have a very fine system of reward
ing athletes for outstanding per
formances. When members of the
swimming team, for example, win
national titles, they present them
with Block "S" sweaters. And each
member of a tearv that wins a na
lional title usually gets his varsity
sweater.
Hut there is one team, whose
»nenil>t"rs are «>!' unusually high
cabin/*, which lias received
practically no attention so far.
It is the STANFORD RIFLE
TEAM.
As a team, it has won 39 out ef
4!) matches. It has beaten teams
all over the country. In the West
Point match, the lowest Stanford
man had a better score than
West Point's highest man.
The team has improved its score
from 1831 in an early match to 1936
in a late one. And the team that de
feated the Indians scored but 11122
points! That team represented Texas
A. and M.. where riHo shooting is a
major sport.
In a recent shoot, one of the mem
bers of the team lost a chance for a
trip to England this summer by one
point. But the man who won it had
to shoot a new world's record to get
the trip.
The team defeated Long Beach
for the state championship and it
also has the state individual title
holder.
The outstanding members through
out the season have been: J. Adams,
Harding, Pasco, Wilhelm, and
White. Of these, Harding and Adams
are given an excellent chance to
make the Olympic team.
Over at California the rifle
team members receive Circle "C"
awards for making the team.
And it is doubtful if their team
could stand up against the one
that is at present representing
Stanford.
It would look mighty queer to
place a man or two on the Olympic
team and have to admit that their
work received no notice in the uni
versity they represent. If lor no
other reason than the work that
Ihey have done as an intercollegiate
team they deserve some kind of
an award.
If Stanford's varsity baseball
team hasn't done anything else, it
has developed the best second base
man in the league to keep Stan- I
lord's name on the all-conference j
team, and has developed one of the j
best chuckers in Stan Anderson.
The league batting averages,
as released last Saturday, put
Yince Philippi at the top of the
list with an average of .450, I
about :i0 points ahead of the
field. The same afternoon he
poled out four more blows in
four times at bat. If he hits even
