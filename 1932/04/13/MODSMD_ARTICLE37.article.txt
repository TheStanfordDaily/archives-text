l fornia freshman track stars go j
I through their last hard workouts j
I today for the annual Papoose-Bear |
i Club classic to be held Friday after
j noon on the Stanford Oval,
| Announcement that Herb Joslin,
j Stanford weightman, is definitely
! out of Friday's meet has caused |
Coach Bill Ellington to double his
j efforts in searching for possible place I
winners against California shot put
j ters and discus throwers. Cook, i
Hager, and Perko are the only j
' freshman shot putters, and they i
! have yet to surpass 40 feet consis- j
; tently.
Meek and Hazard
Dave Meek of California has ,
| thrown the 12-pound shot 55 feet, |
i 8 inches, while Mackey, McVay, and j
I Darracq have all exceeded 51 feel, i
Meek will be out to end a long J
reign of Stanford shot-putters Fri
day when he tries to better John |
Lyman's record of 48 feet, 2 inches
; for the sixteen-pound shot.
i The Indian discus throwers are
; Rothert, Peters, and Herringer, a
new recruit from the yearling base
ball team. These men are capable
| of about 115 feet, which should earn
1 a second or third against Mackey

1 and Jones of California.
There is still much uncertainty as
to the personnel of Stanford's one
mile relay team. A1 Blackman, suf
fering from a torn ligament incur
red in February, will run the anchor
lap after already competing in the
100 and 220, while Bob Brown, one
of the fastest men on the squad, will
have already competed in the mile
or the 880, or both.
Baton-Passers
Ward Vincent, Pierre Zucco, and
Johnny Mottram are other baton
passing candidates. Ward and Pierre
will have already run the 440, while
Mottram may be one of the three
spear tossers to compete against
California javelin throwers.
