# Water Poloists Travel South
## 
### 
Burke Knapp, star goal guard of
the Indian varsity water polo team,
expects to put his name on the list
of possibilities for the ail-coast team
this year by pulling off some fancy
work in front of the cage at the
Minor Sports carnival Friday and
Saturday. Knapp is undoubtedly
one of the best goalies on the coast
and'should convince any coast team
picker of his abilities.
Pack Suitcases
He and eleven others will journey
south Thursday night on the Sun
set Limited to participate in the
swimming events of the Pacific Coast
Conference Intercollegiate Cham
pions, otherwise known as the
Minor Sports Carnival. Captajn

Kinkead, and Ray Wilbur are the
other members of the tank team
and water polo team who will make
the trip.
Wiget Stay-at-llome
Harris, Kinkead, and Knapp are
the only men who will be used ex
clusively in water polo, with Booth,
Clapp, Graves, ancl de Silva doing
double duty as both swimmers and
poloists. This is the first Cardinal
competition Ted Wiget has missed
in many a day, but he has not reg
istered this quarter, and therefore
is ineligible.

scheduled for Friday afternoon at
1:30, water polo preliminaries at 4
o'clock, swimming finals at 8 o'clock
Saturday, and water polo finals im
mediately afterward.
