Boasting a trio of good chuckers in Bill Winter, Bud Rose, and Tom!
Murphy, and two .400 or better hitters in Bobby Decker and Lenny i
; Bergdahl, the U.C.L.A. team is invading the North this week wtih the
j avowed purpose of acquiring a stranglehold on second place in the
j conference standings.

The Bruins split two games in the
1 South with Stanford, California,
Santa Clara, and St. Mary's. Four
victories out of the next five games
would K've them second place and
a chance to play S.C. for the cham
pionship. This would have to in
clude one win from California.
Winter came North with a record
of four victories against two defeats,
but dropped the first game to Santa
Clara, 8-5, when Schnerr, Murray
and Powers hit successive homers
in the eighth inning.
California has but two more games
on the conference schedule. One of
them is with the Bruins Thursday,
and the other with Stanford Satur
day. U.S.C. has three left, and they
are all with the aspiring Westwood
outfit. Stanford has four remaining
contests, and if the Indians win all
of them they will be lucky to finish
in better than a tie for third.
U.S.C., California, and U.C.L.A.
are the only teams conceded a
chance for the pennant. However,
should the Indians win all of their
four remaining battles they will
throw a monkey wrench into the
championship machinery of both the
Bears and the Bruins.
Stanford's team has been one of
the "in-and outers" of the confer
ence, but if the team pulls one or
two more wins like the one last
Saturday, the pennant race may look
a lot different.
