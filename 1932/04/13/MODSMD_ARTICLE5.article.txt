scene in spring are among his sub
jects. His work is characterized by
crystal clearness, excellence of de

"After the Rain," a study, by Ber- j
ton Crandall, of iris blossoms sprin- |
kled with glistening raindrops, is a i
photograph of unusual artistry. '

tograph in "Fog in the Valleys," in |
which lacy fir trees are silhouetted !
against the mist.
Two photographs of special inter- j
est to Stanford students were done |
by Paul M. Narbutovski, one of the i
shaded walk from the Gallery to i
Encina, and ihe other of the foun
tain playing in the Union court. |

(ion of small details, shown in a j
study of daffodils and of a snow
covered bridge.

Crawford shows a group of camera '
