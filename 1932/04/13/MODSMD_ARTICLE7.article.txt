# One Field Win Would Please Doomed Bears
## U.C. May Take Shot-put In Coming Big Meet 
### Dick Strouse 
Carefully stacking the Cards he j
will play against California Satur- j
day in the coast's spring athletic j
classic, Stanford Track Coach Bill
Ellington has been forced to reduce
his aces in each event from the pro
verbial four to a powerful trio. Be
cause Big Meet regulations provide
for but three entries per team per
event, Ellington held trials yester
day.
Bill Willard, junior broad-jump
ing expert who has arrived out of
nowhere to question the supremacy
of Werder and Butler, and Laurel
Lewis, a hitherto unknown high
jumper, won the extra places in the
trials.
Willard Defies Gravity
Willard leaped a neat 22 feet 9Vi;
inches to beat out Phil Williams :
for the right to wear a nice, clean j
track suit Saturday. Williams him- !
self did 22 feet 1 inch, which augers |
well for the inexperienced sopho
more next season. Willard, along
with Werder and Butler, will be out
to sweep the broad-jump in the j
Large Trackfest as the Bears' coach
—Walt Christie —has yet to find a j
man capable of breaking up this se- !
lect Society of West-bay leapers.
Bob Jones and Don Blackman wih j
be Lewis' jumping mates. Jones ;
should win, but it is questionable if i
Blackman and Lewis can shut out .
the high-flying Golden Bear.
Dopeless
Impossible to dope, the pole-vault I
presents many complications. Bill
Miller and Bert DeGroot would be j
cinches for first and second if they :
were in good shape, but as it is, j
DeGroot and Ned Johns of the In
dians and Pool and VanTress of the 1
Bears may tie for first at 13 lect. !
Ray Outstanding * I
In spite of the threat of two Cali- j
fornia men capable of reaching the j
190-foot mark, A1 Ray should take I
the javelin to keep the Bear in his j
subterranean hideout.
The shot-put offers California its j
only real chance for a win in the j
field events. Hank Deßerry may 1
take Gray, Lyman, and Laborde ,
into camp, but if two of these three j
aren't beyond 50 feet, one should !
be, so that Deßerry will probably j
feel he has earned it if he adds three j
points to a hopeless Berkeley cause.

more next season. Willard, along
with Werder and Butler, will be out
to sweep the broad-jump in the j
Large Trackfest as the Bears' coach
—Walt Christie —has yet to find a j
man capable of breaking up this se- !
lect Society of West-bay leapers.
Bob Jones and Don Blackman wih j
be Lewis' jumping mates. Jones ;
should win, but it is questionable if i
Blackman and Lewis can shut out .
the high-flying Golden Bear.
Dopeless
Impossible to dope, the pole-vault I
presents many complications. Bill
Miller and Bert DeGroot would be j
cinches for first and second if they :
were in good shape, but as it is, j
DeGroot and Ned Johns of the In
dians and Pool and VanTress of the 1
Bears may tie for first at 13 lect. !
Ray Outstanding * I
In spite of the threat of two Cali- j
fornia men capable of reaching the j
190-foot mark, A1 Ray should take I
the javelin to keep the Bear in his j
subterranean hideout.
The shot-put offers California its j
only real chance for a win in the j
field events. Hank Deßerry may 1
take Gray, Lyman, and Laborde ,
into camp, but if two of these three j
aren't beyond 50 feet, one should !
be, so that Deßerry will probably j
feel he has earned it if he adds three j
points to a hopeless Berkeley cause.
