# CHAMPIONSHIP IN GOLFERS' GRASP
## Bel Air Club Course Today Is Scene Of Meet 
### Maurice Rapf 
Stanford's first 1932 championship
will hang in the balance today as
six Cardinal golfers go through their
paces on the Bel Air Country Club
course in Los Angeles for the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate golf crown.
Dangerous as the assumption may
now seem, Stanford's representation
looms as the outstanding favorite to
capture this event, the first of this
year's Minor Sports Carnival.
In the Del Monte college tourna
ment, Eddie Twiggs' golfers man
aged to beat out California, U.C.L.A.,
and U.S.C., the same field against
which they will compete today, so
there is little reason to believe that
they cannot repeat this triumph.
Charlie Scavcr
Number one on the Stanford team
is Charlie Seaver, an amateur player
of national standing, but Seaver's
number one spot by no means as
sures the fact that he will turn in
the best score of the Palo Alto con
tingent. Not with men like Captain
Harry Eichelberger, Herman Hell
man. Stuart Hawley, Dick Hoag, and
Gene Brown playing along with him.
Chief competition will undoubt
edly come from U.S.C., with their
two star performers, Winston Fuller
and Bud Lawson. California also
has a w&ll-rounded team, with Stu
art Heatley and Herbert Schultz the
outstanding golfers.
Six Eligible
Six men are eligible to tee off for
each school, with the four best
scores counting toward a team total.
The lowest gross turned in by a
squad wins the title. Members of the
fencing, swimming, water polo, ten
nis, and gymnastic teams leave for
Los Angeles tonight.
Construction of a plant for (he
production of commercial potash
salts has been started in the area
of the Dead sea.
