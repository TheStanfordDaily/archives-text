# FARM EXTENDS GREAT OVATION TO OPERA STAR
## John Charles Thomas Was Last Artist On Card Concert Series 
### Beatrice Bishop 
Singing in a beautiful, mellow i
baritone voice and displaying rare |
musicianship in every selection, j
John Charles Thomas last night re- i
ceived the greatest and most enthu- ;
siastic applause given any artist on ,
the campus this season. Unending!
clapping and stamping by a practi- j
cally full house, reluctant to leave, j
was ample evidence of the esteem j
and appreciation granted the famous |
singer, the last of the season's |
A.S.S.U. Concert Series artists.
In a short, friendly talk at the j
end of his program, Thomas said, !
with a pleased smile on his face, "I ■
am always very, very happy when
I feel that my songs and what talent
I have have entertained. You may !
as well know I am very happy to
night."
Last Encore Lauded
Thomas' last encore, "01' Man
River," a universal favorite, brought
forth thunderous applause. "Mah
Lindy Lou" and "Old Mother Hub
bard" were equally well received
as encores.
From the first note uttered by
Thomas, the audience sat attentive
and enraptured. "Der Ton" by Jo
seph Marx, described as a rhapsodic
song sung in praise of music, was
truly musical and powerfully pre
sented. Marvelous control and ef
fortless singing marked the whole
program.
The friendly, jovial manner in
which the famous artist gave recol
lections and explanations of songs
did away with any artificiality be- ;
tween the audience and the singer.j
His interpretations of the two chil- j
dren's songs—"Priere du Soil - " by
Mossorgsky and "Sailormen" by
Jacques Wolfe—were extremely na- (
tural and whimsical, and highly ap
preciated.
Toreador Song
"Chanson de la Puce" by Mous
sorgsky, the sardonic song of Me
phistopheles in Faust, with its ma
lignant laugh, and the "Song of
the Toreador" from Carmen, an en
core, were two outstanding selec- i
tions, powerfully presented and long
applauded.
Other encores included "Mattin
atta" of Leoncavallo and an air
from "La Traviata." Each selection
on the program deserves special
mention because of its artistic pre
sentation. Fine acting and a winning
personality combined with rare mu- j
cianship to make the concert a sue- j
cess.
Singing Impressive
Impressive and subtle was the
baritone's singing of "Ruhe, meine
Seele" by Richard Strauss, and full
of spirit was his presentation of
"Standchen" by Johannes Brahms.
"Home on Ihe Range" was touching,
and "When I think upon the
Maidens" a whimsical bit of song.
Lester Hodges was an excellent
accompanist. In his four piano se
lections he displayed musical talent
of his own. "Music Box" by Emil
Sauer was delicately played on the
treble keys. A picturesque number
was "Ritual Fire Dance" by Manuel
de Falla. As an encore Hodges pre
sented "Ballet" of Gluck-Friedman.
A finished touch was noticeable in I
his interpretations of these compo
sitions.
Airplanes were used to take a
census of elk in the rough Jackson
Hole region of Wyoming.
