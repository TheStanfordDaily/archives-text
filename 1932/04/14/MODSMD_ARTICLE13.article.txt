### ROLPH MALLOCH 
In spite of Mr. Edison's phono
graph discs, the hoarse murmurs of
the radio, and the insidious moans
of the brass-veined saxophones,
Stanfordites proved last night that
they have not been completely se
duced by the wares of Tin Pan Al
ley.
Almost unprecedented enthusiasm
greeted John Charles Thomas, pre
mier American baritone, last night in
the Pavilion. Professors who main
| tained that the younger generation
1 is uncultured are thinking up somc-
I thing new to say.
For the first time this season,
Thomas gave two operatic encores —
a tribute to the Stanford audience,
as the soloist has sung 08 times this
season o» a six-months', 150,000 mile
J tour, covering 76 cities in 28 states.
The melody of the baritone's voice
I drifting out through the doors of
! the Pavilion, even broke up the
| chauffeurs' crap game, an adjunct to
| every Concert Series program.
! Young, smartly-dressed Mrs.
j Thomas, backstage, flushed delight
! edly at the applause received by her

j powerful-voiced and strong-bodied
| husband. She said "The Thomas
| family—both of us—are ardent
I fishermen. We are anxious to get
| back to our summer home and fish
j ing boat on the Maryland coast."
Thomas added, when he came back
j tf> the dressing-room flushed and
! tired, that golf was his next favorite
j occupation. "I'm going to trim Cap
! tain Dobbsie on the San Francisco
i links this week.''
Legitimate jazz, well-done, has a
l defiinite place in music, maintained
Thomas. "There are limes when
| serious music is out of place."
"The Pacific Coast appeals to me.
! There seems to be less despondency
i and pessimism than in the East."
He then told about the first time
| he was scheduled to sing the opera
1 "La Traviata," and found, fifteen
minutes before the performance,
that he hadn't the necessary white
gloves. Five dollars to a cab driver,
who sped madly to the nearest un
dertaking parlor, resulted in slight
ly-soiled, but never-t he-less ade
quate white gloves.
