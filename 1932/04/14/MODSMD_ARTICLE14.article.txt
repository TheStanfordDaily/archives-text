# SEQUOIA SCHEMES AS "MARTYR DOGS" DISTURB MORPHEUS
## 
### 
Sequoia is on the warpath
again!
The isolated outpost of the
Stanford "Rough" has wit
nessed many conspiracies for
daring exploits. The Axe res
cuers plotted within its walls.
Annual assaults on the Roble
swimming pool are instigated
by Sequoia residents.
But now the Sequoia men
are outraged by the nocturnal
yowlings of the dogs incarcer
ated in the rear of the anatomy
lab. These victims to be sacri
ficed on the altar of science
voice their mournful laments
to the discomfort of the Se
quoia "rough."
Much secrecy shrouds the
proposed attack on the dis
turbers of the peace. The en
gineering students, however,
are well known for their in
genious plans. |
