## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 13. (TP) —A few
hours after a secret conference with
John Hughes Curtis of Norfolk,
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh
slipped away from his Hopewell,
N.J., estate early this morning on a
mysterious mission. He had not re
turned early tonight.
Two other developments bright
ened the hopes of investigators—the
recovery in New York of the first
Lindbergh ransom bill and the un
heralded arrival in Vienna of Major
Charles H. Schoeffel of the New
Jersey State police.
Mrs. David Isaacs found that a
$20 bill her husband had obtained
at a branch bank bore one of the
numbers announced by the Treas
ury. Officials of the bank were able
to say only that the bill came to
them either Monday, April 4, or the
following day. A formal statement
confirmed this afternoon that the
ransom was paid Saturday, April 2.
