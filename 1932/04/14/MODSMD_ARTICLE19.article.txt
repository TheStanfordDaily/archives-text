# Hoarded Money Is Wildly Circulated As King Race Ends
## Marion "SeeyaFriday" Hewlett Will Be Fourth Pi Phi To Be Masque Ball Queen During Last Five Years; Prelsnik Leads By 1,496 
### 
£ HUCKLING "MONTANA MOON" PRELSNIK and Marion "Seeya-
Friday" Hewlett will jointly occupy the Masque Ball throne in the i
Pavilion Friday evening.
Winning in the last second of voting from the Iledhead-Yaple com- '
bination which led at that time, the new King and Queen finally put away
a large roll of greenbacks that had gradually dwindled down from its
original enormous proportions.
Jack "Portland Menace" Redhead and Maxine "Kansas City's Cutie" '
Yaple were a serious threat throughout the contest, and amassed a total

i; of 21,08(5 votes us against 22,582 for,
j the victorious capitalists.
$763.38 Profit
A total of 81,338 votes were ac- '
j counted for in the election. With \
| over 200 invitations already sold and
| 25 free votes with' each one, a bal- j
| ance of roughly 76,338 is left. This
I means, that so far tlie affair has 1
i shown a profit of $763.38, the largest i
; sum ever made through votes alone
j on a similar event.
A crowd of over 300 roughs and j
j fans from the "500" was madly mill-
I ing about the polls on the Library !
[ lawn yesterday as they closed at 3 ;
