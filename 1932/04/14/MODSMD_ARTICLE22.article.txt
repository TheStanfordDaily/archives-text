# BABE RUNNERS HOPE FOR WIN IN BEAR MEET
## Cub Yearlings Seek End Of Nine Yearly Losses At Cards Hands OVAL SCENE OF CLASH Ellington's Men May Upset Favorites Tomorrow 
### Albert Guerard 
| California's freshman track team
1 this morning began celebrating the
i end of the depression, which, ac
, cording to Coaches Walt Christie, A1
; Regan, and Eddie Beeson officially
i comes to an end tomorrow afternoon
j on the Stanford Oval, when Stan
ford and California yearling stars
| tangle in their annual Little Big
' Meet.
I After losing every Little Big Meet
since 1923, the Bear Cubs expect I<>
| inflict a stinging defeat on Bill El-
I lington's men, and initiate an era
! of prosperity in California freshman
I track, which loyal Berkeleyites ul
i timately hope will spread to Coach
j Christie's less-promising varsity
trackmen.
Frosh Determined
I On the Stanford Oval, while Bill
| Ellington is muttering incoherent
i pessimisms, the Indian hopefuls are
! going about their training tasks with
| a grim determination that will far
I from lighten California's task to-
I morrow afternoon.
When the California coaching staff
sent out their first appeal for fresh-
J man stars this season, a large group
iof prep-school record-holders an
j swered the call. Foremost among
j these were Harold Branting, sprinter
j and broad-jumper, Ray Hitchings,
quarter-miler, Dave Meek, high
jumper and weight man, and Sid
I Cochran, pole-vaulter.
Star Dash Man
! Branting, later elected captain of
I the Bear Cubs, is still the outstand
' ing man in the 100-yard dash, and
j has already bettered the existing
j Little Big Meet broad-jump rec
j ord by more than a foot. Branting's
i time for the 100 is 10 flat, while his
i mark of 23 feet, 6 inches in the
| broad-jump is one of the best jumps
! made throughout the country this
i year. Forbes King, Ray Maroux, and
I James Magee are the other Bear
j sprinters, all three men having done
, 10.2 or better in high-school 100-
j yard dashes. Although Branting is
j a slight favorite to defeat Stanford's
i A1 Blackman in the 100, the Bear
I captain will stay out of the 220 in
| an attempt to set up a new Little
; Big Meet broad-jump mark.
In early season meets Ray Hitch
! ings has proved a disappointment,
j his mark of 53 seconds not ap
proaching the 51.2 mark turned in
;by him while at Alameda High
I School. "The 'nth Gill," Carol by
| name, has so far proved the most
| consistent Bear 440 man, and his
time of 52.9, identical with Stanford's
j Ward Vincent's best mark, .indicates
| that the 440 should prove one of the
j most thrilling events of tomorrow's
j meet.
Mossman Successor
Willard Mills, whose season rec
, ord is 2:08, leads the pack of Bear
! half-milers, while Schuyler Albert
j looms as the most promising fresh
j man miler since "Spud" Mossman.
Albert's best time of 4:38 indicates
that Phil Morentin will have to ex
j tend himself to preserve his unde
i feated record in the mile run. Joe
| Eggart and Robert Mossman, young-
I er brother of "Spud," are the out
] standing California two-milers.
Coach Ragan, himself a one-time
| California hurdler, has developed
i strong timber men in Herbert Mc
| Vay and Carl Kindt, while E'Vlie
i Beeson, former world's high—jimp
