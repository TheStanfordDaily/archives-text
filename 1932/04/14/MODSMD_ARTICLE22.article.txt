# BABE RUNNERS HOPE FOR WIN IN BEAR MEET
## Cub Yearlings Seek End Of Nine Yearly Losses At Cards Hands OVAL SCENE OF CLASH Ellington's Men May Upset Favorites Tomorrow 
### Albert Guerard 
| California's freshman track team
1 this morning began celebrating the
i end of the depression, which, ac
, cording to Coaches Walt Christie, A1
; Regan, and Eddie Beeson officially
i comes to an end tomorrow afternoon
j on the Stanford Oval, when Stan
ford and California yearling stars
| tangle in their annual Little Big
' Meet.
I After losing every Little Big Meet
since 1923, the Bear Cubs expect I<>
| inflict a stinging defeat on Bill El-
I lington's men, and initiate an era
! of prosperity in California freshman
I track, which loyal Berkeleyites ul
i timately hope will spread to Coach
j Christie's less-promising varsity
trackmen.
Frosh Determined
I On the Stanford Oval, while Bill
| Ellington is muttering incoherent
i pessimisms, the Indian hopefuls are
! going about their training tasks with
| a grim determination that will far
I from lighten California's task to-
I morrow afternoon.
When the California coaching staff
sent out their first appeal for fresh-
J man stars this season, a large group
iof prep-school record-holders an
j swered the call. Foremost among
j these were Harold Branting, sprinter
j and broad-jumper, Ray Hitchings,
quarter-miler, Dave Meek, high
jumper and weight man, and Sid
I Cochran, pole-vaulter.
Star Dash Man
! Branting, later elected captain of
I the Bear Cubs, is still the outstand
' ing man in the 100-yard dash, and
j has already bettered the existing
j Little Big Meet broad-jump rec
j ord by more than a foot. Branting's
i time for the 100 is 10 flat, while his
i mark of 23 feet, 6 inches in the
| broad-jump is one of the best jumps
! made throughout the country this
i year. Forbes King, Ray Maroux, and
I James Magee are the other Bear
j sprinters, all three men having done
, 10.2 or better in high-school 100-
j yard dashes. Although Branting is
j a slight favorite to defeat Stanford's
i A1 Blackman in the 100, the Bear
I captain will stay out of the 220 in
| an attempt to set up a new Little
; Big Meet broad-jump mark.
In early season meets Ray Hitch
! ings has proved a disappointment,
j his mark of 53 seconds not ap
proaching the 51.2 mark turned in
;by him while at Alameda High
I School. "The 'nth Gill," Carol by
| name, has so far proved the most
| consistent Bear 440 man, and his
time of 52.9, identical with Stanford's
j Ward Vincent's best mark, .indicates
| that the 440 should prove one of the
j most thrilling events of tomorrow's
j meet.
Mossman Successor
Willard Mills, whose season rec
, ord is 2:08, leads the pack of Bear
! half-milers, while Schuyler Albert
j looms as the most promising fresh
j man miler since "Spud" Mossman.
Albert's best time of 4:38 indicates
that Phil Morentin will have to ex
j tend himself to preserve his unde
i feated record in the mile run. Joe
| Eggart and Robert Mossman, young-
I er brother of "Spud," are the out
] standing California two-milers.
Coach Ragan, himself a one-time
| California hurdler, has developed
i strong timber men in Herbert Mc
| Vay and Carl Kindt, while E'Vlie
i Beeson, former world's high—jimp
champion, ha.s seemingvy imparted
much of his leaping ability to Dave
Meek and Howard Mackey. Meek's
chief claim to honors, however, is
as a prospective shot-put champion.
Tall and powerful, this former Red
lands High star has a good chance
of exceeding John Lyman's meet
record of 48 feet, 2 inches.
Cochran, the other early season
star, ha.s more than lived up to prep
school promise, by vaulting 12 feet,
2 inches. Stanford's Lory Rothert
cleared 12 feet, 6 inches while at
L.A. High School, but has failed to
do better than 11 feet, 0 inches this
year.
Less hampered by injuries, Cali
fornia deserves a slight edge in the
final score, when season records are
compared. The Stanford freshmen,
however, expect to win their ninth
straight Little Big Meet tomorrow
afternoon.

that Phil Morentin will have to ex
j tend himself to preserve his unde
i feated record in the mile run. Joe
| Eggart and Robert Mossman, young-
I er brother of "Spud," are the out
] standing California two-milers.
Coach Ragan, himself a one-time
| California hurdler, has developed
i strong timber men in Herbert Mc
| Vay and Carl Kindt, while E'Vlie
i Beeson, former world's high—jimp
champion, ha.s seemingvy imparted
much of his leaping ability to Dave
Meek and Howard Mackey. Meek's
chief claim to honors, however, is
as a prospective shot-put champion.
Tall and powerful, this former Red
lands High star has a good chance
of exceeding John Lyman's meet
record of 48 feet, 2 inches.
Cochran, the other early season
star, ha.s more than lived up to prep
school promise, by vaulting 12 feet,
2 inches. Stanford's Lory Rothert
cleared 12 feet, 6 inches while at
L.A. High School, but has failed to
do better than 11 feet, 0 inches this
year.
Less hampered by injuries, Cali
fornia deserves a slight edge in the
final score, when season records are
compared. The Stanford freshmen,
however, expect to win their ninth
straight Little Big Meet tomorrow
afternoon.
