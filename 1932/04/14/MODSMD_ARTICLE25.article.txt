# THE 						BEAR STAGES A COMEBACK
## 
### 
For a long time Ihe old Hear of California lias been tak
ing beatings trom the Cardinal and from various other col
lege athletic teams, some of which would once have been
considered too weak to compete in the same league with
California. East year was possibly the most disastrous of
all as the football team hit a new low. the track team was
snowed under new record scores, the baseball nine lost
three strai. il to Stanford, the tennis squad bowed to the
Indians, and even Ihe basketball boys failed to win their
usual Coast Conference championship.
Ihe Rlue and Cold was on rock bottom in 19.'i0 .'>l. but
il looks as though il was darkest just before the dawn.
Records of Ihe California freshman track team, which
comes down to the Farm tomorrow a slight favorite to
heal Hill Ellington's babes, bring to mind the fact that
Herkelev has acquired some real athletes in the class of
".'{">. Their football eleven went through an undefeated sea
son last fall; the basketball live was one of Ihe strongest
in this region; their trackmen include several stars of
great future promise, and their baseball heroes have
cleaned up this spring.
l»y all the rules of the dope, Hear varsity teams ought to
pick up in remarkable fashion during the next year or two
as these frosh develop. If tliev do, no one outside Ihe
Herkelev campus will be better pleased than the sons of the
Cardinal.
To have Ihe I »ig Came, Rig Meet, and other Stanford-
California competitions return to their original dominant
positions is one of the biggest hopes of all Farm sports
fans. Even the most hallowed of traditional rivalries can
not maintain a pre-eminent place in sports interest when
Ihe contests are one-sided over a long period of years.
There is. of course, no question as to the natural rivalry
of Stanford and California, but so long as F.S.C. was the
only institution offering serious competition in most sports,
campus interest was bound to be concentrated more on the
Trojan engagements than on the Hear tilts.
With the advent of Hill Ingram at Herkelev and the
coincident appearance of a line crop of freshmen all this
ought lo change. A speedy return to Ihe old situation, when
California games were Ihe climax of each season, looms
al last on the horizon.
