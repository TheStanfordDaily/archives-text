The impression that is current in !
i most circles i.s that "time" i.s some- :
thing definite and absolute —some-
thing above and beyond mortal man.
i The "Tent-Maker" it was who, in
iambic pentameter, maintained that
nothing the individual could do:
could ever defeat the ruthless hand!
I ol time. Th.it may be true over there
i 'midst Eastern sand dunes. That
j may be true in the laboratory. It
\ may be true any place—but it isn't
i true on this campus.
1 Fur example, it i.s possible to leave
! the "Union Cellar"' .it C o'clock sharp
—walk slowly to the Library—.smoke i
' a cigarette—and still, it is only (SI
o'clock. Marvelous, you may cry— !
and you will be right. It is marvel- |
ous. It is to be marveled that in this ,
day of electric clocks, it is impos- |
sible to synchronize time recorders i
on a small area like this campus.
But of course, if there were only
! two time systems on the campus, the '
j situation would not be so perplexing, j
1 It is comparatively easy to remem- i
| ber the approximate ratio between I
Union and Libe—although it is a
nuisance to suffix all appointments !
at the House of Books with "by the j
; Libe clocks." Then we have the !
morning "power-house" whistles—'
; the noon .md five o'clock wheezes i

UNDECIDED HAND OF TIME

I advertise r is always showing us the
; courtesy oi' lli, "correct time" to the
! split second.
After wearing out three stems and
i six pairs of funds, and callousing
! one good thumb and finger setting
■ our watch at every new indication
| of the correct time we happened to
meet on the campus—we have given
up trying. We just accept the in
evitable. What will be, will be. After
all, it is only a universal custom
that decrees that all clocks in one
| area should have identical time.
Here, the winds of freedom blow.
1 Why not let them blow on the
i clocks as well as anything else?
Not being a scientist, il is difficult
| to tell who is wrong, ft is impossible
I to point the scorning linger at any
] body and say, "Change your clock."
I But could not somebody in authority
! decide to m ike "Pacific Coast
i Standard Time" as given out by
I Western Union (advt.) or Postal
; Telegraph (advt.) official on the
I campus and make all clocks and
bells, etc., hew to it? Or any stand
i ard can be taken; we are not too
; exacting — "Swiss Royal," "Congo
1 Absolute"—anything.
On the other hand, we have Mark
Twain's idea that time is a mere
j figment of the mind and has no
i basis in reality. Yet, this world is
; run on figments—including the fig
| ment. of time. —Abe Mellinkoff
