TIIE LOST SQUADRON —At the !
Stanford Theatre.
If you are an extreme addict of
good old-fashioned melodrama 1
packed full of thrilling air scenes, j
then you may like "The Lost Squad- |
ron."
R-K-0 has assembled an all-star i
cast for this picture. Erich Von Stro- \
heim stars as the ruthless movie i
director who sends his pilots sky
ward so that he may get a couple j
of good shots when the unsuspect
ing airman crashes to his death.
There was too little of this forceful j
actor. He didn't enter the plot until j
the middle part of the story, and he ;
was killed quite a ways from the
end. Even then he made a good ,
corpse.
Richard Dix, Robert Armstrong, j
and Joel McCrea all make very i
handsome, dashing aviators. Dor- ;
othy Jordan and Mary Astor in the i
feminine leads are as lovely as usual, j
A picture for aviation thrill
seekers only. —B.M.
LET l'S DIVORCE—At the Geary
Theatre.
Ruth Chatterton was ever before i
our eyes and minds at the opening
of "Let Us Divorce," despite ihe
fact that she did not take a stage
part in the play. We followed her
into the theatre and continued to
watch her as she sat in the audience :
almost as unconcerned and incon
spicuous as any other spectator.
When the lights were out, it was
this lovely producer's personality
which charmed us. Throughout the
interpretation of both Rose Hobart
and of Ralph Forbes, Miss Chatter- 1
ton's personality shone. Her trick i
of staccato speeches and quick im- j
petuous movements was used to ad
vantage by both of the stars.
Ralph Forbes plays the part of a
fascinating young English divorce
lawyer who in the advent of a Lon
don log quite innocently, in his be
lief, becomes the cor-respondent in
the divorce case of his own client, i
Rose Hobart impishly wangles her |
way into his heart and heartlessly i
upsets the routine of his life for ;
some time. Miss Hobart's gaiety and I
coquettishness elude description.
The play is light and almost far
cical. It has been carefully directed
and beautifully produced by means
of rich settings and tasty costuming.
The detail throughout the produc
tion has been minutely handled. :
Even the telephone has assumed a
modern realism—it distinctly echoes

I the conversation of Ihe party at the
| other end of the line. —E.E.H.
THE AGE FOR LOVE—At the New
Monlo Theatre.
The eternal triangle again. What
starts out very dully, like one of
these one-man and two-women af
fairs with an "I won't give him up"
angle, gradually developing into a
fairly good picture.
The story isn't good. It hps a
rather queer ending. The finale is
neither right or wrong, just a sort
of a mediocre mess. But what it
lacks in story and plot, Biilie Dove
make up in fine character portrayal.
The male lead is another one of
these matinee idols of the would
be he-man type with a passion for
children. Edward Everett Horton
lends a touch of comedy to the plot
now and then.
But if Billie Dove did not arise
with superb action time and again
to save a situation which would
otherwise be a ('op—the show would
not be worth seeing. —J.H.G.
