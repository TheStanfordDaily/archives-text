# Phar Lap Ailing Before U.S. Trip, Autopsy Bares
## 
### 
ATHERTON, April 13. (A 3 )â€”Phar j
Lap, famous Australian race horse j
who died mysteriously on April 5 !
at the Ed Perry stables here, was
not in good health when he arrived i
in this country.
The preliminary report made to
the horse's owner, D. J. Davis, was j
.said to show a condition of the j
stomach, spleen, and intestines that i
may have existed for some time be- i
fore his arrival in the United States. !
Had the horse been in the best of j
health, according to the theory of
several persons familiar with the
ways of horses, the small amount
of poison-sprayed leaves or grass'
Phar Lap may have eaten, could
hardly have resulted fatally.

Two men clad in dirty, ragged
clothing broke into a Rutherford
ton, N. C., store, dressed themselves |
in stylish outfits and left their old
clothing behind. Nothing else was
missed. I
