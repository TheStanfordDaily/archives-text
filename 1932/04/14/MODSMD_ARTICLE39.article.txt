ABOUT THE TIME that Les Ha
bit's makes the final payment on Ihe j
Ilables Wing of the Palo Alto Hos- '
pital and departs from the Farm |
with his sheepskin, he should be in J
pretty fair physical condition.
Did not the sawbones take out his
appendix there? Have they not
patched up innumerable burned
feet, pulled muscles, and what not
for King City's fastest human? And
are not they now excavating daily
on his sinuses?
Of course, all that doesn't help his j
chances in the Big Meet. "How do !
you think you'll come out against |
Kiesel Saturday?" we asked Les |
yesterday.
' Probably not so good," replied ■
the elder Hables. "This business of]
having them prod about in my nose j
every day is no fun."

IT WAS NOT so long ago thai
Les was pointing out that Kiesel
was a real runner—that he was
not underestimating California's
lone claim to track and field
fame—but that he expected to !
do his fair share of tape busting
in the IJig Meet sprints.
Now here was the Indian
sprinter admitting his chances
Saturday are not so rosy. "But,"
continued Hables, "I'll give him
a race."
It was the competi
tor, talking. The sinusitis was
forgotten. Kiesel will know lie's
had a busy afternoon after
Stanford's veteran cripple fin
ishes with him—and don't be
surprised if Les pushes his ten
der proboscus across the finish
line first in at least one of the
two sprints. I
WILLIAM E. ELLOTT. the dimin- |
utive jockey who rode Phur Lap to I
victory at Agua Caliente a few!
weeks ago, was scheduled to ride'
"Good and Hot" at Tanforan the day
following the great Australian thor
oughbred's tragic death, but was so j
broken up that he did not appear. ;
Tuesday afternoon, however, he
thrilled the crowd at the San Bruno j
track by bringing Liolele home a
nostril ahead of Mucker, a long shot, i
Racing critics gave Elliott credit for j
r. masterful ride.
Scimitar, who was first heard from ■
this season when he surprised by ;
taking third money in the Caliente 1
Handicap which Phar Lap won, did
not place. Scimitar has been crossing !
up Ihe wise boys at Tanforan, pay
ing long odds on two races and then j
lading to show when option money |
drifted his way in' larger quantities.
