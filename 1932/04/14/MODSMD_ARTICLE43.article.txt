### 
Student tickets for Saturday's I»ig
Meet with California may he ob
tained by Stanford men or women
| at Berkeley on Saturday upon pre-
I scntation of their registration card
j and 50 cents. The meet starts at 1:110,
and will he held on the University
i of California's new oval.
With fine chances of sweeping one
I event and getting first and second in
! four others, Stanford's Indian Farm
! crs are assured of wins in every Big
! Meet race except the dashes. Bob
; Kiesel may take a weakened Les
I Hables in both sprints, but if he
J does lie will be the only Bear to
I engage in tape-breaking exercises
Saturday.
Stanford's sweep will come in the
| 440 if Coach Bill Ellington elects to
! run either Frank Lombardi or Cap
j tain Alvin .Hables with Ben Eastman
i and Paul Nash. Present plans call
for Lombardi to run the 220 and ihe
relay, and Ike to limit his endeavors
to the baton race, but either may
; be switched at the last minute.
His certain victory in the quarter
j should warm Eastman up for an
j equally certain win in the 880.
j George Naylon should take second,
: but it is doubtful if Charlie de-
Bretteville can nose the Bears out
of third.
Storms, Atkinson, Raftery
! With Jim Ferrie already counting
the five points he will win in the
j mile, A1 Storms and Bob Atkinson,
and Raftery of U.C. will wage a lit—
i tie battle of their own for second
place. Storms can beat Raftery if
: he doesn't run his first three laps
' in the 3:12 he recorded Tuesday in
a trial, while Atkinson has slightly
less than an equal chance to finish
ahead of the Bear ace.
Assured of first and second in ihe
- two hurdle races, the Cards will bo
I out to sweep both of them. Meier
j ..nd Brugman are three yards ahead
of the field in the highs, with Dean
i Stallings, the third Indian high
i hurdler, about on a par with
j Crawford of the Bears. Herbert and
{ Meier will have to fall down to miss
j the first two places in the lows, and
I Brugman will try for the extra
; digit.
Win for Amdahl
] Oliie Amdahl will probably stay
! behind Art Azevedo for the first six
i laps of the two-mile and then shuf
| file out to an easy win. Azevedo and
I Lee of the Bears should put on an
j interesting battle for second place.
Aebersold is the third Card entry.
Bob Jones, Here Laborde, and
Nellie Gray assure Stanford of a
| swoon in the discus. Ray Dawson
! will help A1 Ray and Dunn in the
| javelin, having been chosen yester-
I day in place of Kay Kantzer. Buck
| Van Dellen will pole-vault instead
'of the injured Bill Miller while
; Phil Williams will join Hables and
I Giberson in the 100. The relay team,
, according to uncertain indications,
I will include Fullenwider, Ben East
| man, Ike Hables, and Lombardi.

Student tickets for Saturday's I»ig
Meet with California may he ob
tained by Stanford men or women
| at Berkeley on Saturday upon pre-
I scntation of their registration card
j and 50 cents. The meet starts at 1:110,
and will he held on the University
i of California's new oval.
With fine chances of sweeping one
I event and getting first and second in
! four others, Stanford's Indian Farm
! crs are assured of wins in every Big
! Meet race except the dashes. Bob
; Kiesel may take a weakened Les
I Hables in both sprints, but if he
J does lie will be the only Bear to
I engage in tape-breaking exercises
Saturday.
Stanford's sweep will come in the
| 440 if Coach Bill Ellington elects to
! run either Frank Lombardi or Cap
j tain Alvin .Hables with Ben Eastman
i and Paul Nash. Present plans call
for Lombardi to run the 220 and ihe
relay, and Ike to limit his endeavors
to the baton race, but either may
; be switched at the last minute.
His certain victory in the quarter
j should warm Eastman up for an
j equally certain win in the 880.
j George Naylon should take second,
: but it is doubtful if Charlie de-
Bretteville can nose the Bears out
of third.
Storms, Atkinson, Raftery
! With Jim Ferrie already counting
the five points he will win in the
j mile, A1 Storms and Bob Atkinson,
and Raftery of U.C. will wage a lit—
i tie battle of their own for second
place. Storms can beat Raftery if
: he doesn't run his first three laps
' in the 3:12 he recorded Tuesday in
a trial, while Atkinson has slightly
less than an equal chance to finish
ahead of the Bear ace.
Assured of first and second in ihe
- two hurdle races, the Cards will bo
I out to sweep both of them. Meier
j ..nd Brugman are three yards ahead
of the field in the highs, with Dean
i Stallings, the third Indian high
i hurdler, about on a par with
j Crawford of the Bears. Herbert and
{ Meier will have to fall down to miss
j the first two places in the lows, and
I Brugman will try for the extra
; digit.
Win for Amdahl
] Oliie Amdahl will probably stay
! behind Art Azevedo for the first six
i laps of the two-mile and then shuf
| file out to an easy win. Azevedo and
I Lee of the Bears should put on an
j interesting battle for second place.
Aebersold is the third Card entry.
Bob Jones, Here Laborde, and
Nellie Gray assure Stanford of a
| swoon in the discus. Ray Dawson
! will help A1 Ray and Dunn in the
| javelin, having been chosen yester-
I day in place of Kay Kantzer. Buck
