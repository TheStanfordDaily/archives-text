# STRONG TROJAN, BRUIN TENNIS OUTFITS THREATEN CARD RATING THIS WEEK-END
## 
### 
i
Despite the fact that they are still
| undefeated in college competition,
Stanford's varsity tennis players are
given less than an equal chance to
I break even in their return matches
i with U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. tomorrow
i and Saturday in Los Angeles.
The six Indian tennis aces who
; will board the Sunset tonight were
j successful in turning back the Cali-
I fornia Golden Bears last Saturday,
; but will all have to be in top-notch
j form to defeat the Trojans tomor-
I row. It is a foregone conclusion that
' U.C.L.A. will win Saturday's meet.
Gledhill Out
I In addition to the fact that they
[ will be meeting their two strongest
I opponents without the services of |
| Keith Gledhill and Jack Cosgrove,
I (he Indian players are unfamiliar
i with the hard cement courts at
> U.S.C. which are reported to be un
| visually fast.
The first meet with the Trojans
' was won by Stanford 5 to 3. The
1 final doubles match was called be
cause of darkness when the score
was tied in the third set. However, !
: Gledhill was largely responsible for
| victories in two of the matches and
lit is hard to determine whether the
, Indians can repeat the victory.
Coughlin Favored
j However, acting Captain Joe
| Coughlin should be able to defeat
Jack Do Lara, U.S.C. No. 1 man.

Coughlin played him in the first
1 meet and won 2-6, 6-3, 6-0. The
j new Stanford No. 1 man has not
! been beaten in competition this
i year. Play in the other matches can
j hardly be figured in advance,
j Stanford's conference chances may
I be said to rest on tomorrow's match,
j Should the Indians win from the
j Trojans they will be certain of a
! tie for the championship. Although
I a win from U.C.L.A. on Saturday is
j practically impossible, any tie play
| off would not be held until the re
i turn of Gledhill and possibly Cos-
I grove.
Those accompanying Coach Sher
j man Lockwood south will be: Joe
I Coughlin, Bob Forbes, Chuck Otis,
j Chuck Weesner, Dan Ellis, John
| Gordon, and Manager Mac Linton.

| Keith Gledhill and Jack Cosgrove,
I (he Indian players are unfamiliar
i with the hard cement courts at
> U.S.C. which are reported to be un
| visually fast.
The first meet with the Trojans
' was won by Stanford 5 to 3. The
1 final doubles match was called be
cause of darkness when the score
was tied in the third set. However, !
: Gledhill was largely responsible for
| victories in two of the matches and
lit is hard to determine whether the
, Indians can repeat the victory.
Coughlin Favored
j However, acting Captain Joe
| Coughlin should be able to defeat
Jack Do Lara, U.S.C. No. 1 man.

Coughlin played him in the first
1 meet and won 2-6, 6-3, 6-0. The
j new Stanford No. 1 man has not
! been beaten in competition this
i year. Play in the other matches can
j hardly be figured in advance,
j Stanford's conference chances may
I be said to rest on tomorrow's match,
j Should the Indians win from the
j Trojans they will be certain of a
! tie for the championship. Although
I a win from U.C.L.A. on Saturday is
j practically impossible, any tie play
| off would not be held until the re
i turn of Gledhill and possibly Cos-
I grove.
Those accompanying Coach Sher
j man Lockwood south will be: Joe
I Coughlin, Bob Forbes, Chuck Otis,
j Chuck Weesner, Dan Ellis, John
| Gordon, and Manager Mac Linton.
