U.C.L.A.'s hopes for the California J
intercollegiate baseball title began \
fading Tuesday when they suffered
their second straight defeat on their J
| northern invasion; this time at the j
hands of the St. Mary's Gaels.
The Gaels banged out 12 hits and !
scored a 9-5 victory over the visi- |
tors, with "Mophead" Murphy on j
the mound, except for the eighth ,
when he was relieved by Lou Rose, i
j St. Mary's had the situation well in j
hand, and the Bruins never gained j
the lead at any time during the j
contest.
Meanwhile, the Broncos from ;
Santa Clara were handing the tail- |
end U.S.F. team one of their worst j
beatings of the year when they came !
out on the top side of an 18-3 score.
The victory moved them into the j
position vacated by U.C.L.A., third !
lung on the conference ladder.
I U.C.L.A. took on U.S.F. yester- j
day, plays California today, and en- !
, counters Stanford tomorrow. To j
! even have a chance for the pennant j
| the Bruins will have to win all of j
j their remaining conference games, '
