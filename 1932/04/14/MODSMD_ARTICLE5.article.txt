## Auditing System Seen As Constructive Move 
### 
Although no report on Tuesday's
action of the Interfraternity Board
of Control was received in the office
of the President yesterday, Dr. Rob
ert E. Swain said last night that he
had familiarized himself with the
resolutions acted upon and that he
saw no reason why he could not
approve them.
He added that in his opinion the
Board of Control had reached a
really constructive solution of the
problem of illegal rushing, espe
cially in providing for an adequate
bookkeeping and auditing system
for each fraternity in order that an
incoming class would not be re
sponsible for past debts, at least
without knowing what they were.
"It is characteristic of Stanford
that we always find a way out of
our difficulties," he said.
Resolutions of the Board of Con
trol provided that the number of
