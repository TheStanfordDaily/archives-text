# EARLY DAYS DESCRIBED
## No Wrong Numbers In 1892 MODERN PHONE SHOWN 
### 
In 1896 there were only three tele- |
phones in Palo Alto and none on
the Campus.
By 1899 Palo Alto had about 75 !
telephones and six were in frater- |
nity houses.
1932—we11, 1932 with 8000 sub
scribers, is a different story. The
Pacific Telephone Company is hold
ing open house today and tomorrow [
with all the modern instruments ;
making up the telephone system on !
display.
The first. Palo Alto Exchange was
established 40 years ago, just a year
after the opening of Stanford. There !
was only one telephone here then, I
located in J. F. Parkenson's store
next to the Palo Alto Hotel on Alma j
Street. Parkenson was required to
take messages over the telephone I
and deliver them all over town. In
1896 the exchange was moved to
Paul's Drug Store—where Sticky's I
now is. By that time the local ex
change had three subscribers. Later
on they moved to the building they [
now occupy.
Parkenson, the first telephone !
agent, was also postmaster at the
time. When he took a message over
the phone, he would frequently write
■it on a piece of paper and slip it in i
the person's mail box.
He has prepared an illustrated
lecture on early Palo Alto history
which he will give in the Telephone
Building from 7:30 to 8:HO o'clock
tonight and tomorrow night. His
talk goes back into the eighties and
will be illustrated with lantern !
slides.
