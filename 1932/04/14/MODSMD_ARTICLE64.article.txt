## Stanford Given Four-Goal Handicap In Tourney; Chance At Lead 
### Bill Myers 
Handicapped by rain cancelling
what was 1o have been their final I
scrimmage yesterday afternoon, the
Card polo team will enter San Ma- i
teo Low-Goal Tournament at San |
Mateo tomorrow.
The Cards should wind up among
the leaders in the low-goal division.
Since downing the Arizona Wildcats I
last quarter, the Stanford quartet j
suddenly found its stride. Scrim- |
mages lately have seen a vast im- !
provement over the somewhat rag
ged form of last fall.
Stanford will be given a four
goal handicap in the tournament.
Any team may enter which does not
have more than an eight-goal rat
ing. The Redshirt four is not a
member of the American Polo As
sociation and does not carry an of- .
ficial handicap. A minimum of one I
goal per player is allowed such
teams.
Other entries in the low-goal di
vision are as yet unannounced, but
it is expected that several Penin
sula teams will be among the con
tenders.
Pete Gillham will hold down the |
number one position. Since being
shifted to this berth for the final
Arizona tilt, Gillham has seemed to j
fit in better than at his old place,
number two. Gillham will have the
assignment of clearing the opposing
defense so that Rufus Spalding, i
sharpshooter of the outfit, can have ■
a free hand in scoring.
At the defensive positions, three
and four, will be Pete Lewis and i
Captain Bruce Fleming. These two!
players have developed a sturdy de- j
fense that opposing teams find hard j
to crack. Both of them arc master
horsemen and hit exceptionally long j
balls.
