# SAFFORD PRESENTS INTERESTING ORGAN COMPOSITION TODAY
## 
### 
i
One of the interesting numbers
which Charles L. Safford, visiting
organist, will play in his organ re
cital this afternoon at 5:10 o'clock
in the Stanford Memorial Church
; will be "Carillon of Westminster"
by Vierne.
Vierne, at his best, is brilliantly j
j effective and has considerable har- I
; monic originality. He received his j
I early instruction from Widor and j
Guilmant, and is ranked with them
as one of the musicians responsible j
i for the revival of interest in the i
â€¢ organ.
| Other compositions on the pro- !
I gram will be:
Andante Cantabile... .Tschaikowsky :
1 Choral Prelude, "Sleepers Wake"
J. S. Bach |
Toccata in F Widor
