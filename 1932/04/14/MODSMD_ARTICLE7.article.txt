# ENGINEERS FALL SPRING VICTIMS; ANNOUNCE DANCE
## 
### 
For years they foiled the Old
Biological Urge, these engi
neers, with their blue jeans
and molten steel, but this year
that insidious influence, spring
fever, took its toll of the
staunchest of them all. At last
the rfltaghest, the toughest, on
the campus are going butterfly.
Five engineering, mining, and
geological societies are behind
the staging of the first all
campus Engineers' Dance, to
be held in the Women's Gym
on Friday, April 29.
"Novel decorations" are
promised. Specifications call
for the wheels to start turning
at 9, and to throttle down at
1 o'clock.
The slide-rule experts have
figured they can meet expenses
by raising 225 rocks, so the bids
are limited to 150 at $1.50 a
couple.
The punch is by the A.S:C.E.,
the decorations by the A.S.M.E.,
the lighting and orchestra by
the A.1.E.E., and the rocks will
be found and disposed of by
the G. & M.S.
