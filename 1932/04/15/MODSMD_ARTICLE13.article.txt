# SIX KILLED AS BLAST WRECKS STATE EDIFICE!
## Explosion, Fire Raze New $6,000,000 Building At Columbus 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 14. (/P)
'—A terrific explosion and fire killed
I an undetermined number of persons
—at least six—in the freshly finished
$0,000,000 State office building today.
More than two score were known
jto have been injured when the
I force of the explosion tore away a
i portion of one side of the 13-story
| marble structure facing on the
j Scioto river.
Two hours later, shortly after 5
; p.m., firemen succeeded in bringing
under control fire that followed in
the wake of< the blast.
30 Thought Buried
Belief that thirty men still lay
buried in the debris caused rescue
crews to work frantically at clear
! ing out the wrecked lower floors.
All the dead and injured were
: thought to be workmen engaged in
: putting the finishing touches to the
| structure.
j More than 100 men were in the
i building when the blast, of an origin
not at once determined, ripped up
i ward and outward from the base
ment and first floor and hurled
great slabs of white marble into the
! air. Heavy ornamental bronze doors
of the building were wrenched from
! their hinges and steel window frames
were torn from Ihe casings.
Interior Razed
Workmen said the building was
"twisted" as high as the twelfth
floor, and the interior of the build
ing seemed entirely wrecked.
Construction of the imposing edi
fice has been surrounded by an al
most constant pall of labor troubles,
1 and early speculation on the part of
some officials was toward the theory
that a bomb possibly had caused the j
( damage.
Sewer Gas Blamed
F. O. Everett of the Ohio Inspec- i
[ tion Bureau, advanced the theory I
| that sewer gas, seeping into the
, building, lifted a section of the west
i wall twenty-five feet high and 200 !
feet long into the air. Great slabs |
of marble sailed out over the Scioto !
river.
Series of Troubles
Dense clouds of smoke billowed
from the gaping hole and shattered I
windows.
The building, covering' an entire !
city block, was to have been occu- I
pied in May. It was started in 1929. !
During its construction labor fights
occurred among workers who ques- '
lioned the right of various building !
trades organizations to do various l
jobs. At one time the plasterers were j
on strike several weeks. Hardly had
they returned than the painters and :
ornamental iron workers quit be
cause of differences of opinion

COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 14. (/P)
'—A terrific explosion and fire killed
I an undetermined number of persons
—at least six—in the freshly finished
$0,000,000 State office building today.
More than two score were known
jto have been injured when the
I force of the explosion tore away a
i portion of one side of the 13-story
| marble structure facing on the
j Scioto river.
Two hours later, shortly after 5
; p.m., firemen succeeded in bringing
under control fire that followed in
the wake of< the blast.
30 Thought Buried
Belief that thirty men still lay
buried in the debris caused rescue
crews to work frantically at clear
! ing out the wrecked lower floors.
All the dead and injured were
: thought to be workmen engaged in
