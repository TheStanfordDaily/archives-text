### 
FTER six years' absence from the campus where he made athletic
history in three sports, Ernie Nevers, Stanford's greatest football and
baseball star, wi!l return to the Farm next fall in the role of assistant to
Pop Warner. Officially confirming the numerous rumors that have been
circulating for weeks, the Stanford Board of Trustees appointed Nevers
yesterday afternoon to a membership on the Physical Education stalT.
The Board of Athletic Control drew up a resolution last Sunday recom
mending the appointment of Nevers, which resolution was presented to
the Board of Trustees by acting-President Robert Ecklcs Swain.

When questioned concerning his
| opinion of Nevers' appointment yes
| terday, Pop Warner displayed more
; than his wonted amount of enthu
siasm.
"Fine," said the Old Fox. "It suits
I me great that Ernie can be with us."
"Pop" to Decide
J Nevers' contract is such that War-
I ner will be able to decide if he
wants big Ernie to work with him
| and the varsity, or help with the
j Grays or the frosh. Warner said
; yesterday that he would let his own
j wishes, the good of Stanford foot
i ball, and Nevers' desires govern his'
; decision. "We'll iron it all out all
j right," added Pop.
Nevers was an all-American foot
| ball star for the Indians in 1924-25-
I 26. During the same years, he was
i known as the hardest-hitting and
! most effective baseball pitcher on
; the coast.
Pro Grid Star
| After leaving Stanford, Nevers
! played professional football with the
1 Duluth Eskimos and big league
1 baseball with the St. Louis Browns
j for a year. Then he was with the
! Green Bay Packers grid team, until
j the Chicago Cardinals purchased his
] services.
The Windy City outfit wanted
â–  Nevers for his ability as a coach
l and manager as well as for his re
j doutable feats on the gridiron.
! Nevers had complete charge of the
1 squad, and was eminently successful
in his dual role.
Although Nevers' appointment
doesn't go into effect until next fall,
he may help Warner with spring
; practice. He has already had a year's
j coaching experience at Stanford, as
i he assisted in drilling the Grays in
1927.
