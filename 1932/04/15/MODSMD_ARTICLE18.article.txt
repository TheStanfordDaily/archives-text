# EQUESTRIAN CLASS IN JUMPING PROVES POPULAR ON FARM
## 
### 
The jumping class organized by
Captain Gordon at the beginning of
this quarter has proven so popular
that there are scarcely enough
mounts to supply all the aspiring
equestrians.
The class is held each morning at
8 o'clock. Attendance is voluntary,
and no credit is given for the course.
Very little jumping has been done
so far, since most of the riders are
relatively inexperienced.
After some of the more advanced
principles of horsemanship have
been featured, three-foot jumps will
be erected, and the men taught to
go over these with as few spills as
possible.
