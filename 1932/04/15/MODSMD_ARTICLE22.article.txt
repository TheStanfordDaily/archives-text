# SHOT-PUT STAR OF 1931 WON'T THROW SPHERE TOMORROW

### 
Second place in the 1.C.4-A.'s
ought to be good enough to earn
■ any man a place on any track team
jin the country. But such is not the
; case with George Grey, one of the
Stanford weight stars.
Last year, Grey threw the shot
slightly less than 49 feet to finish
second in the big event at Harvard
behind Hall of U.S.C. Grey also was
third in the shot in both the Cali
fornia-Stanford and Troy-Indian
meets in 1931.
But tomorrow's Big Meet will find
big George a non-competitor. The
excellence of Nellie Gray, John Ly
man, and Here Laborde has shoved
Grey to fourth place among the
Card shot-putters, and only three
men can enter one event.
