Kight years ago, when Pop Warner lirst came to the
Farm to look over the men who were to start work under
him, a blond giant with the speed of Mercury immediately
caught his eve. He was a tind, one of those men who come
once in the lifetime to a coach.
His feats on the gridiron were destined to ring through
out the football world, climaxed with the unheard-of per
formance of playing with both ankles broken through sixty
minutes of hall in an intcrsectional struggle on the Rose
Bowl turf in 102 I, and later by unanimous selection on the
all-American eleven of 192.").
Yesterday Krnie Xevers returned to Stanford, his alma
mater. It is only natural that all who have seen him play
will mourn the fact that he can never again don the Car
dinal uniform to slash and tear his way through opposing
lines. But. of course, that is useless, for the playing days
of the greatest fullback of all time are over.
It is as an assistant coach that Xevers comes. Where
and just how he will be used by Warner has not yet been
revealed. But that is of little significance.
The mere fact that Xevers has returned is reason
< nough for all good friends of Stanford and of football to
rejoice.
