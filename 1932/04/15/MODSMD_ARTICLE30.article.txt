# BULL SESSION
## AN EDUCATIONAL HANGOVER 
### 
When the end-quarter cram be
gins, any criticism of final examina
tions is listened to; but discounted
as a personal reaction to a person
ally unpleasant situation. Now,
when finals are forgotten memories,
few are interested in the subject,
but at lertst the immediate personal
stimulus is lacking. It is possible to
view finals with a calm that only
harmless sunshine can cause; being
weeks away, it is possible to con
sider these ridiculous impossibilities
with total impartiality.
There are several reasons given
for justifying the existence of finals.
First and most popular is that study
ing for a final gives one a co-ordi
nated picture of the whole course —
showing all parts in their proper
relationship. It sounds plausible for
after al! one does have to cover the
entire text to clear the evil odored
bog at the end of each subject. But
such reasoning is only valid if the
final is what might be termed a
"thought" or "problem" type of ex
amination.
If the final is of the type which
requires the student to draw upon
the particular facts he has mustered
—and create new conclusions, then
this logic is understandable. But is
this the case? In 99 per cent of the
courses, the final is nothing but a
glorified (i.e. enlarged) fifteen min
ute quiz. It is nothing but a larger
accumulating of petty* questions re
quiring nothing on the student's
part but an adept memory, quick
penmanship, and ample ink—the pa
per being furnished by the Adminis
tration.
In such a case, the final co-ordi
nates nothing. It merely demands

| disgusting memorization of a wider
' body of facts. The "problem" type
of examination would take little if
I any reviewing—and absolutely no
• hectic cramming. But present finals
I require cramming —by all — even
those who study throughout the
! quarter expecting that small group
| with phenomenal memory for un
j related facts. To prove that students
| merely make a temporary annex of
I these isolated facts to "crack" the
I final, let a group of "A" students
| retake their finals one year—or even
j one quarter after completing the
i course; and their showing will be
! both revealing and pitiful.
I
j The other advantage supposed to
j adhere to finals is that it makes
, students work. Obviously, the vast
i grade stress placed on finals will
I create a corresponding amount of
j forced labor. But if this stress were
; removed and redistributed over sev
| eral quizzes, there is every reason to
l believe that work would also be re
! distributed. The same desire to stay
| at the University is present in both
j systems.
I ..
j The common superstition that
1 hitting the final will pull anybody
! through a course is well founded.
' It results (among those that frankly
! just want to get by) in minimum
; study during the quarter and pres-
I sure for a week or so. And because
; finals usually require facts rather
! than understanding, such procedure
I does work. To students that do work,
finals are only an unnecessary dis
comforture and a revolting waste
of time.
, The best argument for finals is
their existence, which ol course is
no argument but an apology.
