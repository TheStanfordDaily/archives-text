MURDER IN THE HOUSE OF ! 1
COMMONS— By Mary Agnes
Hamilton. Houghton Miffiin Com- j
pany. Boston and New York, 15)32. !
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop).
Though technically a murder mys- ■,
tery, this book is most interesting j.
; for the vivid picture it presents of j (
the English Parliament. The author j
is a former member of Parliament :
and this inside pictui'e has there- 1
fore a ring of authenticity. j,
The plot is a rather simple one. ■
The party chief is busy getting an j ,
important bill through an all-night ,
session, while on the fog-smothered j
! terrace two members of the party j
find the strangled body of a no- |
torious woman who was known to i
have been about to sell to a news- j
paper some letters from the leader !
of the party. The two members must
find the murderer so their leader j
will not be suspected, and after they
; have found him they must discover
a way to deal with him so as to save
the leader's reputation and inci
dentally the party.
The discovery of the murderer is |
made soon, and one never gets very
wrought up over the puzzle. The
I reader will find the book a bit tedi
j ous in spots, but this is more than
] made up for by the careful, expert,
j and realistic delineation of charac
ter and the very fine descriptive I
| writing. The atmosphere is so beau
j tifully done that it is both ever- i
I present and unobtrusive.

i "THESE RESTLESS HEADS' —By
Branch Cabell. Literary Guild.
1932.
"These Restless Heads" would ap- j
j pear to the casual reader to be a
I slightly illegitimate grandson of the
depression. Here Branch Cabell, for
| the author of "Jurgen" and "Cream
of the Jest" signals this latest opus
by discarding his erstwhile first
name, James, reviews old memories
of Poictesme, soft nights, and fading
music. "James" seems all, indeed,
that Cabell has discarded, for with- 1
| out the benefit of more than an un
i born spark of originality, Cabell
j makes the reader relive all the ad
' ventures and philosophies, with but
| outward changes of his former
j works.
The too finely selected phrase, the
artificial swinging perfection of Ca
bell's "drawing-room style' per
meates "These Restless Heads," a
triology of romantics as it is de
j scribed, which bears all the ear
i marks of unadorned reprinting from
' some of the author's magazine ar
ticles.
The familiar "Art for Art's Sake"
j doctrine again furnishes the theme j
for Cabell's delicate argument. But,
j whether from financial reasons as ;
j inferred above, or from sheer lack i
, of youthful originality, Cabell gives
I the impression in this latest book of
borrowing Oliver Goldsmith's eigh
! teenth century methods of exploit
| ing time-worn plots and ideals . . .
i seeking always to clothe his art in
j lying colors, and drawing from the
cellars of past literary successes to
| fill these 1932 bottles with that same
soft, soothing, slightly effervescent
i wine which delighted readers of the*
"Cream of the Jest." —A.J.G.
THE HEART OF NEW YORK — At
the Varsity Theatre.
This film is just another of the
never-ending flood of pictures of the
"Abie's Irish Rose'' ilk—a story of (
1 Jewish life in I le East Side of New j
i York, in which a large family under- i
' goes all sorts of tribulations.
Tribulations of the family are no
i greater or no less than any of their
! forerunners, and a lot less inter
estingly told—not that any of the
i others were any good. The story is
i simple to the point of being stupid: |

Brother A is an inventor whose in
ventions are not as good as his in
tentions, and Brother Bis a busi
ness man who is more busy than
business-like. Imagine if you can,
many feet of film dealing with rau
cous quarreling between brothers
and family in Jewish dialect. You
guessed it, a little palling. The finale
you can imagine: Brother A comes
through, makes money, and all's
well that ends well. This picture is
only for those who like this sort of
thing, and we suppose there are
such people left. Quick, clap your
hands if you believe in Jewish pic
tures! Their voices are getting
farther and farther away! Well, we
really had no hope.
You can skip the shorts if you like;
anyhow, fair warning. —E.C.
