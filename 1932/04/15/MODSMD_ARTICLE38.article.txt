I By L.M.C. I
NINETY-EIGHT to 100 points,
and possibly a new Bis-; Moot record.
That will be (he goal of Stanford's
1932 track and field team as it
crosses the bay tomorrow for Ihe
:59th annual meeting with California
on the cinder trails. It has been
nine years since the Bears and In
dians last tangled at Berkeley, and
it has been nine years since Cali
fornia last defeated a Stanford track
team.
Back in 1923 Dink Templeton took
a powerful team of youngsters across
the bay to lose an 82' i; to 48 J /li de
cision to Walter Christie's veterans.
Tomorrow, invading California's
beautiful now track stadium for the
first time, the Indians expect to
more than atone for that last
trouncing under the shadow of the
Campanile.
Stanford's chances of bettering the
Big Meet scoring record of last
year, when the Cardinal-clad ath
letes amassed a total of 101. 2-3
points, are not too promising, but
the 100-point goal is not at all im
probable. Assistant Coach Bill El
lington, always cautious about esti
mates, looks for the Indians to roll
up a total of 98 to 100 points.
IF ALL GOES well tomorrow,'
the Indians will lake every lirst
place but two—and may grab
one of those. Bob Kiesel, the
brilliant Bear sprinter, is gen
erally conceded first places in
the century and furlong because
of the latest illness of Los
Hahlcs, but it is not beyond the
realm of possible that Hables
will put over an upset.
In a position comparable to
Hables is Fred Deßerry, shot
put prospect developed l>y
Christie this year. Like the one
armed papcrhanger, lie has a
bad case of hives and lias been
spending most of the last week
in the hospital.
But regardless of the icliy
lumps, he is expected to force
Nellie Gray out beyond the 50-
foot mark to take first place.
The only other Bear threats
for first places arc Rice in the
high-jump and Pool in the pole
vault. Rice would he given much
more consideration were he not
so erratic.
FROM LOS ANGELES comes
word that Frankie WykofT will enter
a test race against the Olympic Club
Saturday in a dual meet at Occi
dental College. This in spite of the
fact that the fleet Trojan has been
advised by his physician to remain
idle for a month to give a strained |
muscle in his back a chance to heal, j
tVykoff and De an Cromwell are i
quoted as believing that he must i
start light work this week if he is ;
ever to get in shape—meaning in ;
shape for the Stanford meet on |
April 30, of course.
Poor Frankie. Ho has been first, so j
long that there is no longer a thrill ;
in breaking the tape—and SO much i
is expected of him. It's small won- i
der that he remarked recently that j
lie was "sick of it all."
ERNIE NEVERS is coming
back to Stanford.
This time it's official. One San
Francisco morning paper pub
lished a rumor a month ago that j
Ernie would return to the Farm.
A few days ago the opposition
came back with a scoop to the
effect that the B.A.C. had recom
mended to the administration
that Stanford's greatest football
player be hired as assistant grid
coach.
Now, almost as an anti-climax,
comes the official announcement
that Nevers has a job on the
Farm at last.
There was a time when the
sports departments of the four
San Francisco newspapers got
along together hi fine style—
that is. line style for newspaper
sports departments. Then some- ]
one got the exclusive story that j
Jimmy Needles was being let
out at U.S.F.; someone else got
a scoop on who was to take his
place; the rumor that Pop War
ner was going to have Rabbit ;
Hradshaw and Chuck Winter
burn trade places made a great
story; and then came the Nevers j
yarn.
We can't help wondering what
the heck will be next.
Nambu, Japanese holder of the
world's broad-jump record of 2G
feet, 2 inches, has also covered 100
meters in 10.6 seconds, tying Percy
Williams' Olympic rccord.
