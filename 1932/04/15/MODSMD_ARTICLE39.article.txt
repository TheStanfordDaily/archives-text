Indians Favored
By reason of their close game witl
U.S.C., and their victory over the
Berkeley aggregation, as well as tht
fact that they have been defeatec
only once on their own diamond
the Indians will be favored to whip
the invaders this afternoon.
U.C.L.A. has been unable to dc
much on the northern trip, getting
oft" to a bad start by dropping the
first two games, to Santa Clara and
St. Mary's. And although the Bruins
have played good ball on a number
of occasions this year, they are in
an in-and-out ball club that is weak
in the pitching department.
In this respect, Stanford cannot
be given much of an edge, since the
team's ace hurler, Stan Anderson, is
being saved for the California game
Saturday. However, the team has
had a week's rest, and there is no
reason why it cannot give either
Herm Estes or Ernie Caddel enough
support to defeat the fourth-place
visitors.
Bruins Boast Sluggers
The Bruins boast a pair of sluggers
in Bergdahl, their lead-off man, and
Decker their clean-up batter. Decker
will be remembered as the young
ster who trotted around Stanford's
lelt end for a touchdown last year.
He hits the horsehide as well as he
carries the pigskin, and Farm fans
will probably see some long-range
clouts if he gets hold of the ball.
Stanford can match this pair with
Pliilippi, the league's leading hitter,
and Ike Livermore, who has one of
the ten best averages in the circuit,
despite his ability to hit them long
and high.
Rose May Pitch
It is still probable that Lou "Bud"
Rose will be on the mound for the
southerners. Bill Winter, the Bruins'
leading chucker, lost to Santa Clara
Monday and California yesterday.
"Mophead" Murphy and Rose
handled the St. Mary's defeat, and
so far there has been no report on
the U.S.F. game. It is possible that
U.C.L.A. will try Rose, who has
been their most promising sopho
more, or Murphy because of his vic
tory over the Cardinals last year.
The Bruins came North with the
avowed intention of taking at least
three of the five games. To date they
have dropped at least three of them.
In other words, Captain Bill Bru
baker, who was named on Coach
Harry Wolter's all-coast team two
j years ago, and his mates will be out
: after Indian meat, and if Stanford
| fails to play the game shown last
I Saturday will catch it.

of occasions this year, they are in
an in-and-out ball club that is weak
in the pitching department.
In this respect, Stanford cannot
be given much of an edge, since the
team's ace hurler, Stan Anderson, is
being saved for the California game
Saturday. However, the team has
had a week's rest, and there is no
reason why it cannot give either
Herm Estes or Ernie Caddel enough
support to defeat the fourth-place
visitors.
Bruins Boast Sluggers
The Bruins boast a pair of sluggers
in Bergdahl, their lead-off man, and
Decker their clean-up batter. Decker
will be remembered as the young
ster who trotted around Stanford's
lelt end for a touchdown last year.
He hits the horsehide as well as he
carries the pigskin, and Farm fans
will probably see some long-range
clouts if he gets hold of the ball.
Stanford can match this pair with
Pliilippi, the league's leading hitter,
and Ike Livermore, who has one of
the ten best averages in the circuit,
despite his ability to hit them long
and high.
Rose May Pitch
It is still probable that Lou "Bud"
Rose will be on the mound for the
southerners. Bill Winter, the Bruins'
leading chucker, lost to Santa Clara
Monday and California yesterday.
"Mophead" Murphy and Rose
handled the St. Mary's defeat, and
so far there has been no report on
the U.S.F. game. It is possible that
U.C.L.A. will try Rose, who has
been their most promising sopho
more, or Murphy because of his vic
tory over the Cardinals last year.
The Bruins came North with the
avowed intention of taking at least
three of the five games. To date they
have dropped at least three of them.
In other words, Captain Bill Bru
baker, who was named on Coach
Harry Wolter's all-coast team two

By reason of their close game witl
U.S.C., and their victory over the
Berkeley aggregation, as well as tht
fact that they have been defeatec

the Indians will be favored to whip
the invaders this afternoon.
U.C.L.A. has been unable to dc
much on the northern trip, getting
oft" to a bad start by dropping the
first two games, to Santa Clara and
St. Mary's. And although the Bruins
