# Stanford Holds Every Big Meet Record But One
## Churchill's Javelin Toss Is Sole U.C. Mark 
### R. B. S 
I Since 1014, when Skin Wilson ran ;
a mile in 4 minutes, 20.2 seconds, j
I until 1931 when Podge Smith gal
j loped over ten low hurdles and 220 ;
j yards of cinder in 23.5 seconds, the j
finest among Stanford and Califor- j
nia track stars have been hanging J
up Big Meet records, until now the
list of best performances in the an- '
nual Farm-Berkeley dual contains
! good marks in all events and great
| ones in several.
j Wilson's record has stood for 17
i years and will still be standing Sat- |
| urday night. But 1928 Stanford Cap
j tain Bud Spencer's quarter-mile \
i mark and 102G Stanford Captain Bill j
j Richardson's 880 record are not so j
j safe.
"Eastman—38 Flat"
I Spencer wrote his name into the I
i Big Meet record books in 1928 and
I his famous successor—Ben Eastman J
—may erase "Spencer—48 flat" and i
! substitute "Eastman—38 flat"—or '
I somethin'—tomorrow.
I Eastman also furnishes n challenge
' ] to Richardson's record of 1:53.8. The
two-mile time, recorded by Hank
| Coe in 1928 and tied by California's
! Spud Mossman last year, is 9:38.2
; and should stand.
100 May Be Broken
In the sprints, however. Bob Kiesel
or Les Hables should break the 100-
j yard mark and at. least equal the
, 220 record. Hec Dyer ran 9.8 in three
! Big Meets and Barber of California
| registered the same time in 192G.
The furlong record is 21.4, held by
j Dyer, Campbell, and Morris Kirk
: sey, all former Indian dashmen.
Ross Nichols' 14.8 in the highs 1
will not. be surpassed, but may be
I equalled by young Gus Meier. Meier
and Cotto Herbert will find it nearly
; impossible to do as well ;is did
Podge Smith last year in the lows,
however.
Javlin Record Unbeatable
California's only undisputed Big
i Meet record is Ken Churchill's 220- 1
foot, 9-inch javelin toss, which will ;
i be in U.S.C. possession for many i
i years to come. V : rg Dowell holds I
the broad-jump mark at 24 feet, '
