### 
Two Pacific Coast Intercollegiate I
records may fall when Stanford's j
swimmers and water poloists face j
the Bears, Trojans, and Bruins to
day and tomorrow in the annual
Minor Sports carnival at U.S.C.
John McKelvey, national cham- j
pion and record-holder for 50 yards |
in the short pool, will assault the j
Coast long course mark, and Fred
Tebbetts, star backstroker who has
recovered from his recent knee in- J
jury, will try for the Coast 150-yard I
backstroke record.
Stanford sent south last night the |
only team in her history that has j
never been beaten by U.S.C.—both
branches, swimming and water polo.
Holding up this astonishing record
will be (ho duty of both outfits; the
swimmers expect to have little
trouble, while the poloists look for
a tough time. Led by Mickey Riley,
national collegiate and A.A.U. diving
champion, the Trojan swimmers
should outscore all but Stanford.
Captain Frank Booth, John Mc- j
Kelvoy, Austin Clapp, Tuppy Gard
ner, Fred Tebbettn, Gordy Graves,
Bob Clark, Paul de Silva, Larry |
Harris, Don Kinkead, Burk Knapp,
and Ray Wilbur left for U.S.C. last |
night, along with Manager Francis |
Bates and Coaches Braridsten and !
Thornton. The loss of Ted Wiget, |
will weaken Card chances.
