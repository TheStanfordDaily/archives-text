# FROSH TANGLE WITH BEAR CUB SPIKE ARTISTS
## Dope Sheet Favors Stanford To Upset Bear Cubs; Predicts 66-65 Score 
### Albert Guerard 
The gun for the mile run will J
crack at 3:30 this afternoon in the I
Old Oval, starting the first race of 1
the annual Stanford - California !
freshman track meet. Preliminaries !
in the javelin throw begin at 3 o'- j
clock. General admission is fifty j
cents, while student body cards will j
admit the owner for twenty-five i
j cents.
Eight years of Berkeley track !
i famine stand back of the California !
| Bear Cubs today, commanding the j
I Blue and Gold class of '35 to atone j
j for defeats at the hands of Indian j
! freshman track teams in every Lit- |
tie Big Meet since 1924.
Makjng no predictions, but prom- I
ising to exceed their best season j
| marks in nearly every event, Cap- ;
I tain Al Blackman and his Indian
I cohorts are just as determined to
I keep the Stanford winning tradi
tion.
Better Record
Comparative scores, always un- :
j reliable, point to a California vic
tory. The Bears defeated San Fran
| cisco and Alameda high school allâ€”
I star teams, while Bill Ellington's ,
yearlings lost meets to the same i
teams. Weather conditions and per- :
sonnel of the prep school aggrega
tions have varied, however, in ev
| ery meet, invalidating these scores
i as a basis of comparison.
| A question mark surrounds the
i possible finish of five races this
i afternoon, and how points are di
] vided in these crucial events should
j prove the deciding factor of the
meet. These races are the 100-yard
dash, the 440 and 880-yard runs
and the two hurdle races.
Al vs. Ilal
Captain Al and Captain Hal meet
' in the hundred yard dash, when
1 Blackman encounters Harold Bran- ;
ting, leader of the Bear Cubs. Both !
j men, undefeated this season, have
j touched 10 fiat on more than one 1
j occasion, with the California sprint- ;
i er a trifle more consistent at this j
j mark. Other California sprinters
j are Forbes King, Ray Mauroux, and '
James Magee, with Ray Todd the
! other Stanford dash man. Branting
I will not enter the 220.
| All 'five entries in the quarter
! mile have a chance of winning:
i Ray Hitchings, Carol "the next to
I last" Gill, and Howard Dalton for
' California; Ward Vincent and Pierre
i Zucco for Stanford.
Half-Mile
Willard Mills is California's half
I mile threat to throw against George
! Downing, Walt Harris, and Bob
j Dean of Stanford. Mills and Down
] ing have turned in marks of 2:05.8,
! and although Harris has done 2:04.7,
I the race will probably be won by
j Mills or Downing.
j In the all-important hurdle races, 1
; the greatest battle is likely to ds- 1
j velop in the high sticks, where
| Stanford's Jim Savage and Frankie
! Bowles meet Herbert McVay and
j Carl Kindt of California. Russ 1
I Munro, Aylett Cotton, and Bob Buf
: fum tangle with McVay and Kindt
I in the low hurdles.
