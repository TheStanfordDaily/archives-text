Stanford men who may break Big '
Meet records are Blackman in the |
220, Phil Morentin in the mile, Dave j
Devlin in the two-mile, Russ Munro !
in the low hurdles, and Lloyd ■
Schween in the high-jump. These j
are Stanford's most consistent per- j
formers, yet they will be given a
real battle in each event.
Dave Meek, giant .shot-putter, I
and Branting in the broad-jump, i
are likely California record-break
ers.
Two to one favorites in the bet- 1
ting, and boasting a far more im- I
pressive .season's record, the Cali- j
J'ornia freshmen come to Stanford I
today, confident of their ability to !
initiate a new era of California pros
perity. But the Stanford freshmen, :
with memories of Bear Cub lickings \
in football, basketball, tennis, and ;
baseball, are likewise determined to '
win. Favoring the Indians to out
score their opponents 49-28 in the
running events, the Daily predicts
a Stanford victory.
But, win or lose, it'll be a great
meet!
Haaftl Ahmed, Indian miler, ran
this event in 4:08 seconds in a meet

a second faster than the recognized

Final Score -Stanford 6(5, California I
05 j
Stanford men who may break Big '
Meet records are Blackman in the |
220, Phil Morentin in the mile, Dave j
Devlin in the two-mile, Russ Munro !
in the low hurdles, and Lloyd ■
Schween in the high-jump. These j
are Stanford's most consistent per- j
formers, yet they will be given a
real battle in each event.
Dave Meek, giant .shot-putter, I
and Branting in the broad-jump, i
are likely California record-break
ers.
Two to one favorites in the bet- 1
ting, and boasting a far more im- I
pressive .season's record, the Cali- j
J'ornia freshmen come to Stanford I
today, confident of their ability to !
initiate a new era of California pros
perity. But the Stanford freshmen, :
with memories of Bear Cub lickings \
in football, basketball, tennis, and ;
baseball, are likewise determined to '
win. Favoring the Indians to out
score their opponents 49-28 in the
running events, the Daily predicts
a Stanford victory.
But, win or lose, it'll be a great
meet!
Haaftl Ahmed, Indian miler, ran
this event in 4:08 seconds in a meet
at Karachi, India. This is more than
a second faster than the recognized
world's record.
