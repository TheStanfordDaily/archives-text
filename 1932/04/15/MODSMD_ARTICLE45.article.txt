# Dink Predicts Rout Of Bear Tracksters
## Sick Coach Lies Helpless During U.C., Stanford Contest Today 
### Stewart Crawford 
It was the unsteady voice of a sick
man that answered a telephone in
the Lane Hospital yesterday to say,
"Yeah, this is Dink."
Sitting propped in a bed amidst
the snowy white cleanliness that is
every hospital, Dink held the re
ceiver unsteadily, as though it were
unusually heavy. He frowned at the
mouthpiece.
"100 Points—Maybe"
"Yeah, we'll take the Bears, al!
j right. What? No, I haven't tried to
I dope it. A hundred points—well,
| maybe. Sure, I think Les would be
a cinch to take Kiesel if he were
I in shape. But that's something you
' can't tell anything about."
i Dink didn't seem particularly in
i terested in what he was saying. In
; fact, to see him lying there thin and
! gaunt, in a four-by-seven cot, one
| got the impression that the only
: thing he was thinking was, "God,
, how I'd like to get out of this thing."
i He has been in it for five months.
May Be Up in Two Weeks
Dink doesn't know for sure when
he'll be up and around again. Some
of the doctors have told him two
j weeks. Others think it will be
' longer. At any rate, the possibility
that he can go with his team to
Los Angeles for the Trojan meet is
a slender one.
It was bad enough for him to miss
I his first Big Game last fall. Bad
1 enough to have to lie helpless in a
hospital during the Big Meet. But to
be denied the joy of leading his
Indians South to take a revengeful
! crack at the Trojans will be the
worst blow that could have befallen
him.
Missed Big Year
This would have been a big year
for Templeton—the biggest, per-
I haps, of his career. And that is said
; with full realization of the sports
crammed years this youngest of all
recognized coaching masters has
been through. i
As a student at Stanford he won 1
block "S" sweaters in four major
! sports. As coach of the Indian track
team he outsmarted the veteran ,
California mentor, Walter Christie,
j for eight seasons in a row. He has
I developed men whose names are
| bywords of the track world—King,
Spencer, Rothert, two Dyers, Ed
monds, Krenz—and this season the
crowning achievement of them all— j
Ben Bangs Eastman, the world's
fastest in two distances.
Olympic Coach
For three consecutive years Tem
pleton's teams reigned supreme over
college competition with victories in j
i the 1.C.4-A. And in 1928 Dink
I coached the American weightmen '
at the Amsterdam Olympic Games.
They won first, second, and fourth
places.
I But this year, with the Olympics
here on the coast, the 1.C.4-A. only
across the bay, and the final tryouts
of the games virtually in his own
back yard, Dink's energy will all
have gone to fight off the malady
: that struck him at the very worst j
possible time.
He will be more or less a spec- •
tator, instead of the principal figure '
I he deserves to be, in the greatest
; season of track ever to visit Cali
j fornia.

It was bad enough for him to miss
I his first Big Game last fall. Bad

be denied the joy of leading his

him.
Missed Big Year
This would have been a big year
for Templeton—the biggest, per-
I haps, of his career. And that is said
; with full realization of the sports
crammed years this youngest of all
recognized coaching masters has
been through. i
As a student at Stanford he won 1
block "S" sweaters in four major
! sports. As coach of the Indian track
team he outsmarted the veteran ,
California mentor, Walter Christie,
j for eight seasons in a row. He has
I developed men whose names are
| bywords of the track world—King,
Spencer, Rothert, two Dyers, Ed
monds, Krenz—and this season the
crowning achievement of them all— j
Ben Bangs Eastman, the world's
fastest in two distances.
Olympic Coach
For three consecutive years Tem
pleton's teams reigned supreme over
college competition with victories in j
i the 1.C.4-A. And in 1928 Dink
I coached the American weightmen '
at the Amsterdam Olympic Games.
They won first, second, and fourth
places.
I But this year, with the Olympics
here on the coast, the 1.C.4-A. only
across the bay, and the final tryouts
of the games virtually in his own
back yard, Dink's energy will all
have gone to fight off the malady
: that struck him at the very worst j
possible time.
He will be more or less a spec- •
tator, instead of the principal figure '
I he deserves to be, in the greatest
; season of track ever to visit Cali
j fornia.
It was the unsteady voice of a sick
man that answered a telephone in
the Lane Hospital yesterday to say,
"Yeah, this is Dink."
Sitting propped in a bed amidst
the snowy white cleanliness that is
every hospital, Dink held the re
ceiver unsteadily, as though it were
unusually heavy. He frowned at the
mouthpiece.
"100 Points—Maybe"
"Yeah, we'll take the Bears, al!
j right. What? No, I haven't tried to
I dope it. A hundred points—well,
| maybe. Sure, I think Les would be
a cinch to take Kiesel if he were
I in shape. But that's something you
' can't tell anything about."
i Dink didn't seem particularly in
i terested in what he was saying. In
; fact, to see him lying there thin and
! gaunt, in a four-by-seven cot, one
| got the impression that the only
: thing he was thinking was, "God,
, how I'd like to get out of this thing."
i He has been in it for five months.
May Be Up in Two Weeks
Dink doesn't know for sure when
he'll be up and around again. Some
of the doctors have told him two
j weeks. Others think it will be
' longer. At any rate, the possibility
that he can go with his team to
Los Angeles for the Trojan meet is
a slender one.
