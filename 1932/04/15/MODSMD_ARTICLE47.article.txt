# ELLINGTON HAS VARIED CAREER
## Life Story Reveals Ability In Numerous Fields 
### Jack Jernegan 
On the Farm Bill Ellington is
known for the unbroken string of
track victories which his freshman
i teams have won from California in
the past several years and for his
success in handling the varsity
squad this season, but the inside
story of Bill's life reveals the fact
that he is a man of parts and a
| coach of no ordinary versatility.
| Football, basketball, baseball,
track-Ellington has coached them
all and played most of them. At
Sutter High, where he started his
career, Bill was a half-miler and a
high class poie-vaulter, clearing 10
feet 6 inches back in the Nineties,
when the world's record stood at a
; few inches over 11 feet. After grad
i uating, he coached track for a cou
1 pie of years at Sutter, then went to
San Francisco for an engineering
course, following which he became
county surveyor for Sutter county
and in his spare time acted as men
tor for the high-school track, base
ball, and basketball aggregations.
Jumping to Chico State for his
teaching credentials along in 1911,
Bill won his block letter in rugby
and coached the basketball five as
a sideline. Teaching positions at
Biggs and Piedmont filled in the
time until the United States entered
the War, whereupon he joined the
army and spent a year and a half
in France.
After the War Ellington went
back to Biggs, which, for the bene
fit of the uninformed, is near Chico.
There, despite the fact that there
were only 28 boys in high school, he
turned out basketball teams that
four times won the Northern Cali
fornia championships. Football,
baseball, and track teams also were
under Bill's leadership at Biggs.
Kingsburg High was the next
stopping point for the Card acting
coach, and it was from that post
that he came up to Stanford in 1927.
