# STANFORD AIMS FOR NEW HIGH SCORE RECORD
## Four Double-Winners May Share Limelight; Old Marks In Danger KIESEL DASH FAVORITE DeGroot And Bear Captain To Meet Again 
### Dick Strouse 
Four probable double winners, a
; great shot-put duel, the culmination
; of three years of friendly rivalry be
j tween Captain George Pool of Cali-
I fornla and Bert DeGroot of Stanford
in the pole-vault, a possible new
, 1 ; ;h-sforing record— will be
; but a few of <he 1 ilights of the
39th annual Big Mtet to be held
I tomorrow at Berkeley.
j From the angle of a great track
j meet, the affair will not equal the
j standard set by its many brilliant
j predecessors. But 33 years of friendly
j heated rivalry; innumerable indel
i ible traditions written into past track
' history by former stars of the cinder
| path; and the colorful, spring-garbed
! crowds will all be there at Cali
| fornia's new track to make tomor
, row's classic the Big Meet.
A Harmless Mono'lopy
Bob Kiesel of California and
Blazer Ben Eastman, Bob Jones, and

I Gus Meier of Stanford form the
| mighty quartette that will monopo
j lize the limelight tomorrow. Each
jof these stars looks good for two
firsts, with Eastman also bound to
I break the tape as anchor man of
j the Indian relay team.
From the end of the 100 until
Eastman trots across the finish line
! yards ahead of the Bear last-lapper
in the relay, Kiesel, Meier, Jones,
j and Eastman will be the names on
the crowd's lips. Blond Bob, the
| pride of Berkeley, should take the
| dashes; Eastman will mimic Kiesel's
i performances in the middle dis
tances; Meier ought to win both
hurdle races; and Jones' ten points
j will come in the supposedly irre
' concilable high-jump and discus.
Dash Duel
Kiesel's task will be the hardest,
I as he will have to defeat Lcs Hables
: in both sprints. Hables would be an
even choice with the chunky Bear
I sophomore if in the best of shape,
but his recent invalidism makes him
a slight underdog. Ralph Giberson
and Muir of California should wage
a little battle of their own for third
; in the 100, and Frank Lombard!, who
was second in both Big Meet dashes
j last year, will try and beat Hables
| and Kiesel in the furlong.
i Gus Meier,' like Kiesel, is only a
sophomore, but his speed should
outweigh his inexperience and give
him wins in the two barrier events.
Jack Brugman may take Meier in
the highs, and Cotto Herbert has a ;
slight chance to upset his younger ;
team-mate in the lows.
Versatile Jones
Being generous, Boh Jones has let
his famous namesake win golf titles,
but Stanford's tall, dark 1.C.4-A. j
champion is himself making track j
history. Jones' victory in the discus j
tomorrow depends only on his abil
ity to out-tluow his tribesman Here !
Laborde. In the high-jump, Jones
appears an inch or so better than
Rice and Mansell of the Bears and
Farmers Lewis and Don Blackman. '
Eastman, who with Kiesel has the
best chance of making any Big
Meet records, is simply in a class of
his own in both the 440 and the j
880. Last year, Ben won both races |
and also ran the relay against Cali- :
fornia, and hopes to repeat. Captain I
Alvin Hables will have to beat Paul |
Nash, also of the Cards, out of sec- j
ond in the 440, while George Nay lon j
seems capable of garnering three |
points in the half-mile for the
Indians.
Pool vs. DeGroot
Pool, California's leader, won the '
pole-vault when he was a sopho- j
more. Last year, DeGroot reversed
the tables, taking the tall pole event
at 13 feet, 6 inches. Tomorrow these
two stars will clean their slate. Pool
is an erratic vaulter who, if he has j
a good day, may win. But pre-meet '
marks give Ned Johns of Stanford,
who has done 13 feet in every meet
this year, a tie for first with De-
Groot, and Koblick of California.
Doped to score 98 points, the Cards
may break the Big Meet record of
102 2-3 set last year. The record will
go if Hables can take Kiesel in 1
cither dash, Johns or DeGroot win
the pole-vault, and Blackman or :
Lew,is get a tie for second out oi the
high-jump.
Sterling Shot-putters
A mark of 49 feet, 9 inches for i
Hank Deßerry as against one of 50
feet, 2 inches for Nellie Gray prom
ises plenty of action in the shot-put.
John Lyman, who was off form in
the L.A.A.C. meet, may take both 1
Gray and Deßerry, and Here La
borde who has been just under 49
feet this year has a similar chance. :
The javelin, according to current
best marks, gives A1 Ray of Stan- !
ford a slight edge. Pierce of Cali- |
fornia threw 193 feet, 5 3-4 inches j
last Saturday, and his fellow Bear,
Waterbury, was a short distance be
hind. Jerry Dunn may edge into ■
third place for the Cards.
Card Distance Victories
Jim Ferric, who is already look
ing forward to meeting Clif Hal- i
stead of U.S.C. in the mile, will try ;
to knock a few seconds from his i
4:28 mark while winning tomorrow. ;
Raftcry, a California sophomore, will !
have to step to get second place i
from Storms and Atkinson of the I
Indians. Eight laps of side-splitting |
effort will find Ollic Amdahl winning
the two-mile from his team-mates
Azevedo arid Aebersold and young
Mr. Lee of the Bears.
The relay team, as announced by
Bill Ellington yesterday, will find
Frank Lombardi, Paul Nash, Frank
Fullenwider, and the inevitable Ben
Eastman running in that probable j
order for Stanford. They may not
break the Big Meet record set last
year, but they are sure to take the
best that Walt Christie can offer and
outrun them man for man.

The relay team, as announced by

Four probable double winners, a
; great shot-put duel, the culmination
; of three years of friendly rivalry be
j tween Captain George Pool of Cali-
I fornla and Bert DeGroot of Stanford
in the pole-vault, a possible new
, 1 ; ;h-sforing record— will be
; but a few of <he 1 ilights of the
39th annual Big Mtet to be held
I tomorrow at Berkeley.
j From the angle of a great track
j meet, the affair will not equal the
j standard set by its many brilliant
j predecessors. But 33 years of friendly
j heated rivalry; innumerable indel
i ible traditions written into past track
' history by former stars of the cinder
| path; and the colorful, spring-garbed
! crowds will all be there at Cali
| fornia's new track to make tomor
, row's classic the Big Meet.
A Harmless Mono'lopy
Bob Kiesel of California and
Blazer Ben Eastman, Bob Jones, and

I Gus Meier of Stanford form the
| mighty quartette that will monopo
j lize the limelight tomorrow. Each
jof these stars looks good for two
firsts, with Eastman also bound to
I break the tape as anchor man of
j the Indian relay team.
From the end of the 100 until
Eastman trots across the finish line
! yards ahead of the Bear last-lapper
in the relay, Kiesel, Meier, Jones,
j and Eastman will be the names on
the crowd's lips. Blond Bob, the
| pride of Berkeley, should take the
| dashes; Eastman will mimic Kiesel's
i performances in the middle dis
tances; Meier ought to win both
hurdle races; and Jones' ten points
j will come in the supposedly irre
' concilable high-jump and discus.
Dash Duel
Kiesel's task will be the hardest,
I as he will have to defeat Lcs Hables
: in both sprints. Hables would be an
even choice with the chunky Bear
I sophomore if in the best of shape,
but his recent invalidism makes him
a slight underdog. Ralph Giberson
and Muir of California should wage
a little battle of their own for third
; in the 100, and Frank Lombard!, who
was second in both Big Meet dashes
j last year, will try and beat Hables
| and Kiesel in the furlong.
i Gus Meier,' like Kiesel, is only a
sophomore, but his speed should
outweigh his inexperience and give
him wins in the two barrier events.
Jack Brugman may take Meier in
the highs, and Cotto Herbert has a ;
slight chance to upset his younger ;
team-mate in the lows.
Versatile Jones
Being generous, Boh Jones has let
his famous namesake win golf titles,
but Stanford's tall, dark 1.C.4-A. j
champion is himself making track j
history. Jones' victory in the discus j
tomorrow depends only on his abil
ity to out-tluow his tribesman Here !
Laborde. In the high-jump, Jones
appears an inch or so better than
Rice and Mansell of the Bears and
Farmers Lewis and Don Blackman. '
Eastman, who with Kiesel has the
best chance of making any Big
Meet records, is simply in a class of
his own in both the 440 and the j
880. Last year, Ben won both races |
and also ran the relay against Cali- :
fornia, and hopes to repeat. Captain I
Alvin Hables will have to beat Paul |
Nash, also of the Cards, out of sec- j
ond in the 440, while George Nay lon j
seems capable of garnering three |
points in the half-mile for the
Indians.
Pool vs. DeGroot
Pool, California's leader, won the '
pole-vault when he was a sopho- j
more. Last year, DeGroot reversed
the tables, taking the tall pole event
at 13 feet, 6 inches. Tomorrow these
two stars will clean their slate. Pool
is an erratic vaulter who, if he has j
a good day, may win. But pre-meet '
marks give Ned Johns of Stanford,
who has done 13 feet in every meet
this year, a tie for first with De-
Groot, and Koblick of California.
Doped to score 98 points, the Cards
may break the Big Meet record of
102 2-3 set last year. The record will
go if Hables can take Kiesel in 1
cither dash, Johns or DeGroot win
the pole-vault, and Blackman or :
Lew,is get a tie for second out oi the
high-jump.
Sterling Shot-putters
A mark of 49 feet, 9 inches for i
Hank Deßerry as against one of 50
feet, 2 inches for Nellie Gray prom
ises plenty of action in the shot-put.
John Lyman, who was off form in
the L.A.A.C. meet, may take both 1
Gray and Deßerry, and Here La
borde who has been just under 49
feet this year has a similar chance. :
The javelin, according to current
best marks, gives A1 Ray of Stan- !
ford a slight edge. Pierce of Cali- |
fornia threw 193 feet, 5 3-4 inches j
last Saturday, and his fellow Bear,
Waterbury, was a short distance be
hind. Jerry Dunn may edge into ■
third place for the Cards.
Card Distance Victories
Jim Ferric, who is already look
ing forward to meeting Clif Hal- i
stead of U.S.C. in the mile, will try ;

his famous namesake win golf titles,

tomorrow depends only on his abil

Laborde. In the high-jump, Jones
appears an inch or so better than
Rice and Mansell of the Bears and

Eastman, who with Kiesel has the
best chance of making any Big

his own in both the 440 and the j
880. Last year, Ben won both races |
and also ran the relay against Cali- :

Pool vs. DeGroot
Pool, California's leader, won the '
pole-vault when he was a sopho- j
more. Last year, DeGroot reversed
the tables, taking the tall pole event
at 13 feet, 6 inches. Tomorrow these
two stars will clean their slate. Pool
is an erratic vaulter who, if he has j
a good day, may win. But pre-meet '
marks give Ned Johns of Stanford,
who has done 13 feet in every meet
this year, a tie for first with De-
Groot, and Koblick of California.
Doped to score 98 points, the Cards
may break the Big Meet record of
102 2-3 set last year. The record will
go if Hables can take Kiesel in 1
cither dash, Johns or DeGroot win
the pole-vault, and Blackman or :
Lew,is get a tie for second out oi the
high-jump.
