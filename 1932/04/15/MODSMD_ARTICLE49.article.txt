# STANFORD AIMS FOR NEW HIGH SCORE RECORD
## Four Double-Winners May Share Limelight; Old Marks In Danger KIESEL DASH FAVORITE DeGroot And Bear Captain To Meet Again 
### Dick Strouse 
Four probable double winners, a
; great shot-put duel, the culmination
; of three years of friendly rivalry be
j tween Captain George Pool of Cali-
I fornla and Bert DeGroot of Stanford
in the pole-vault, a possible new
, 1 ; ;h-sforing record— will be
; but a few of <he 1 ilights of the
39th annual Big Mtet to be held
I tomorrow at Berkeley.
j From the angle of a great track
j meet, the affair will not equal the
j standard set by its many brilliant
j predecessors. But 33 years of friendly
j heated rivalry; innumerable indel
i ible traditions written into past track
' history by former stars of the cinder
| path; and the colorful, spring-garbed
! crowds will all be there at Cali
| fornia's new track to make tomor
, row's classic the Big Meet.
A Harmless Mono'lopy
Bob Kiesel of California and
Blazer Ben Eastman, Bob Jones, and

I Gus Meier of Stanford form the
| mighty quartette that will monopo
j lize the limelight tomorrow. Each
jof these stars looks good for two
firsts, with Eastman also bound to
I break the tape as anchor man of
j the Indian relay team.
From the end of the 100 until
Eastman trots across the finish line
! yards ahead of the Bear last-lapper
in the relay, Kiesel, Meier, Jones,
j and Eastman will be the names on
the crowd's lips. Blond Bob, the
| pride of Berkeley, should take the
| dashes; Eastman will mimic Kiesel's
i performances in the middle dis
tances; Meier ought to win both
hurdle races; and Jones' ten points
j will come in the supposedly irre
' concilable high-jump and discus.
Dash Duel
Kiesel's task will be the hardest,
I as he will have to defeat Lcs Hables
: in both sprints. Hables would be an
even choice with the chunky Bear
I sophomore if in the best of shape,
but his recent invalidism makes him
a slight underdog. Ralph Giberson
and Muir of California should wage
a little battle of their own for third
; in the 100, and Frank Lombard!, who
was second in both Big Meet dashes
j last year, will try and beat Hables
| and Kiesel in the furlong.
i Gus Meier,' like Kiesel, is only a
sophomore, but his speed should
outweigh his inexperience and give
him wins in the two barrier events.
Jack Brugman may take Meier in
