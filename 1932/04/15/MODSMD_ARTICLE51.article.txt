One of the most significant ath
letic events in Pacific Coast history
Vv'ill take place tomorrow afternoon
when Stanford and California re
new an ancicnt feud on the newest
and finest track and field plant in
the world.
While Stanford reaps the glory of
almost certain victory by piling up
points in California's weak events,
the followers of the Golden Bear
turn their thoughts backward, over
the 31 loyal years which Walter
Christie has spent directing cinder
athletes in Berkeley, and forward to
the time when California will be
producing stars as superior as is the
track on which they ti'ain.
More than $250,000 has been spent
by the A.S.U.C. in erecting this huge
stadium, which gives 20,000 people
a perfect view of every event which
may be staged on track or field.
And it is altogether fitting that the
plant should be dedicated to the
first active sponsor of athletics, par
ticularly track, in the University—
the late Col. George C. Edwards, '73.
The track itself is a beauty, with
220-yard straightaways on each side
of the field, and wide turns banked
tu increase the speed. In front of
the main west stands are the pole
vault and shot put, while the discus
ring and javelin runway diverge
from the center of the field.
On the far side are the high jump
and broad jump, plainly seen from
the stands. Green grass now covers
the field, and the background of the
Berkeley hills offers a bit of scenery
that does much to increase the ex
hilaration one always gets out of
attending a good track meet.
As for the meet itself, a couple of
modest young blonds are expected
to steal the spotlight tomorrow, a |
pair of youngsters about which!
much has appeared in the public
prints of late. One is Ben Eastman,
holder of two unofficial world rec
ords and co-holder of a third, who
will be seen far in front of the field
in the quarter, the half-mile, and
the relay; the other will be Bob
Kiesel, chunky California sophomore
whose strength in the 220-yard dash
lias never been tested, and who last
week tied the official world record
in the century at 9.5.
In the other events, it appears
to be a case of California trying
to snatch stray points away from
Stanford, with the possible excep
tion of the mile, which "Skip" Raf
tery, Bear sophomore, may win by
a whisker from Ferric.
California's hopes were dimmed
considerably in the point-scoring
department with the news that Fred
Deßerry, stellar shot-putter who
has won his event in every meet
this year, is in the hospital with an
attack of hives. While he may com
pete Saturday, he wlil be in no con
dition to meet Stanford's Nellie
Gray on even terms.
Honors in the 440, 880, discus,
broad jump, and high hurdles are
conceded to the Indian squad, but
traditional rivalry and numerous
c lose finishes will make for interest
on the part of the spectators.
Any of the California javelin men
may throw over the 190 foot marker,
to place ahead of Ray of Stanford.
Pierce scored a mark of 193 feet
s ; !i inches in last Saturday's jaysee
