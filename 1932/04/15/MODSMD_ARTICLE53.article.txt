## Plans To Join Six Other Cards In South

Deciding at the last minute to go
South for the A.F.L.A. Pacific Coast
finals, Alfred Snyder of the Stan
ford varsity fencing team will take
part in the novice foils tourney this
week-end in Los Angeles.
Snyder was not among the six
Indian fencers sent South last night
as members of the foil, saber, and
epee teams that will try and win the
Pacific Coast championships for
Stanford. But Snyder looked so
good when winning the Bay Division
novice foil title, that he is making
the trip himself with a good chance
of becoming the Coast champion in
his event.
