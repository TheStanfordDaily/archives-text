# STANFORD WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN L.A. FOILS FINALS
## 
### 
Marian Terwilliger and Carol
I Shriver McQuilling, the two Stan-
I ford women who finished first and
I third in the Bay Division open foils
! championships, left last night for
i Los Angeles to take part in the Pa
| cific Coast finals.
Miss Terwilliger may win the
I Coast championship in the foils, as
i she is an experienced fencer of
i ability. Mrs. McQuilling, who has
not fenced as long as has Miss Ter
| williger, stands somewhat less of a
i chance. The meet in which they
l will participate is one of the A.F.L.A.
I title finals.
