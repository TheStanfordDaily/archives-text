## 
### 
After coaching track at California
for the last 31 years, Walter Chris
tie, dean of American cinder coaches,
will send his last squad against
Stanford tomorrow.
His teams have not been able to
j win a meet from Templeton's pro
i toges for the last eight seasons, and
j from all indications they will have
to taste defeat again tomorrow.
There was a time when Christie
reigned supreme. His squads won
the IC4A championship for three
l years in succession, in '21, '22, and
'23.
In 1924 "Walt" was the head field
i coach of America's winning Olym
j pic team, and before that, in 1920,
1 he was a member of the supervis
| ing staff of the American team. It
was then that he gave a youngster
I by the name of Dink Templeton
1 some instruction in the finer points
of. highr-jumping.
| And so, with Stanford favored to

.win, Walter Christie, the coach, will j
1 witness his last big meet tomorrow |
in the stadium which his work built, j
His resignation takes effect soon, 1
and in the years to come, he will j
probably be seen on the sidelines'
• as an interested spectator, cheering j
on the boys whom he once coached, j
Every Big Game or Big Meet is
sue carries a box feature on the
I übiquitous, omnipresent, and inevi- j
table Gill family. And once again '■
j the Daily must bow to precedent,
i since this afternoon Carol Gill
(member of the illustrious Califor- j
nia Gills, as the S.F. Chronicle would
put it) faces the starter's gun in the i
440-yard dash of Ihe Little Big
' Meet.
