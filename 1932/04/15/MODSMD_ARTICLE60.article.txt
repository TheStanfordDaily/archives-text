# Card-S.C. Meet To Be Thriller
## CONTEST WILL AIR AMERICAN CHANCE IN OLYMPIC GAMES College Dual Championship Will Be At Stake April 30 
### Albert Guerard 
It'll he carnage fil only for stout
hearted men on April 30, when the
Avenging Indians clash with the |
Terrible Trojans in the Olympic i
Stadium. The impact will sound I
throughout the athletic world and |
will be the first American full-blast |
charge at international honors to be j
fought for in this same Olympic j
Stadium early in August, when the j
finals of the Olympic Games will be !
held.
With the intercollegiate dual meet
track championship at stake, Coaches I
Dean Cromwell and Dink Temple- |
ton will lift the veil of secrecy coV- j
ering the early season performances j
of their men. For it is no secret !
that U.S.C. runners and jumpers
have been "under cover," and have
yet to turn in times and distances
approaching performances which
may be expected from them on April |
30.
WvkofV Entry Doubtful
Although pressed ever closer for ;
honors by a great crop of collegiate j
sprinters, Frankie Wykoff is still the |
"Fastest Human." But whether !
Frankie will ever again reach the j
1930 and 1931 form that carried him j
to a new world's record of 9.4 for j
100 yards, is problematical. A badly |
torn muscle, incurred while broad j
jumping at Glendale High, mended
temporarily, and for years appeared |
definitely cured. But today, on the
verge of what should have been his |
greatest season, WykofY again feels j
the ellect of his injury.
It is not vet certain whether or not '
Wykofl' will line up for the 100-yard j
d;;sh in the Olympic Stadium against
Stanford sprinters, but if he does, |
he will have to come close to his
best time to beat out Leslie Ball, Alf
Koenig, and Roy Delby, his team- j
mates, and Lcs Hables of Stanford, j
Two Leslies Meet
It's a tossup between the two
Leslies in the furlong, with Ball and
Hables both 21.3 men, while Delby, j
with a record of 21.4, will be press- j
ing the two rivals for honors.
As understudy to Vic Williams in '
the 440, Art Woessner, the best U.S.C. j
quarter-miler, was developed slowly, j
but with an eye to filling Williams j
shoes adequately. Today, Woessner !
looms as the greatest college quar- j
ter-miler, barring, of course, Stan- I
ford's own Eastman. Woessner may I
go under 48 seconds, in trailing
Eastman home, but his chances of
victory are remote. Ablowich and j
Cuthrie, sophomores, are both 49
second men, and will be battling
with Stanford's hard luck captain, j
Ike Hables, and Frank Lombardi fori
the odd point in the 440 and odd j
points will be big things on April j
30 - . .
Eastman Certain Winner
With Eastman set aside as certain j
vvinner, U.S.C. with Dick Wehncr, j
•3i 11 McGeah, and Roger Foore, will I
;et out to take second and third in j
he half-mile run.
Cliff Halstead's time of 4:28.2 I
(gainst California in the mile run '
vas no true indication of the Tro- |
an star's ability, since last year |
lalstead ran 4:19. Hammatt, third j
slaco winner last year, and Shine,
ire the other Trojan milers, but they i
vill be lucky to get more than a j
mint between them.
A slow 10:02.2 was Earl Callahan's j
ime in beating Lee of California in j

the two mile, but 9:42, Callahan's
best 1931 mark, more nearly gauges i
what Ollie Amdahl, Stanford's fast
improving two-miler, may expect '
when the two tangle. Paul Aeber- I
sold and Art Azevedo, and Ashcraft
of U.S.C. will fight for third in this
race.
Payne Back In Hurdles
This season Dean Cromwell has |
brought two hurdle men out of re
tirement, Jeddy Welsh and Jimmy <
Payne. Welsh, who last ran for the !
Trojans in 1930, skims the high i
hurdles in 14.8, with Trojan Joe Bills I
as his chief competition so far this )
year. Payne, drawn from the team of
1928, is running low hurdles faster i
than anyone in the country, beating I
out his own teammate, Bill Carls. '
What these men do against Gus j
Meier of Stanford may mean vie- '
tory or defeat for the Thundering |
Herd.
Dink Templeton believes that Bill 1
Graber of U.S.C. is the greatest pole- j
vaulter in America. He has gone |
above 14 feet, and what is more, is
known as a competitive athlete.
Pete Chlentzos, U.S.C.'s other good !
pole vaulter is consistent at 13 feet.
High Jumps? Ouch!
The individual records of U.S.C. ;
high jumpers need no comment: Bob |
Van Osdei, 6 feet, 7 1-8 inches, Jim
Stewart, G feet, 6 1-2 inchcs, Jim
Brannon, 6 feet, 5 1-2 inches, Mal
com McNaughton, 6 feet, 4 inches, 1

Donald Norcross, 6 feet, 3 1-2 inchcs.
Stanford's best high jumper, Bob i
Jones, has cleared 6 feet, 1 inch this j
year.
Dick Barber, the peer not only of '
Trojan, but of all college broad |
jumpers, can leap over 25 feet if >
necessary, while Howard Paul, John- !
son, McFadden, and Van Riper are j
capable of 23 feet, but are not con
sistent above 22 feet, 6 inches.
Dean Cromwell's first surprise
package of the year we can |
be sure there'll be many moi - e) is
Heuston Harper, who threw the 16- j
pound shot 49 feet in the California
meet. His teammate, the veteran!
Bob Hall is a slow developer, but j
will be crowding 50 feet when he |
tangles with Messrs. Gray, Lyman, |
and Laborde.
Hall is the only worthy Trojan :
discus tlirower, and he has not sur
passed 147 feet this year, but com
petition may add distance to this j
mark on April 30.
Frank Williamson, 19(5 feet, and i
Kenneth MacKenzie, 194 feet, are the ,
U.S.C. javelin throwers. Last year
MacKenzie tossed the spear a few
feet further than A1 Ray to con
tribute a big part of his team's 09-
02 victory.

Eastman Certain Winner
With Eastman set aside as certain j
vvinner, U.S.C. with Dick Wehncr, j
•3i 11 McGeah, and Roger Foore, will I
;et out to take second and third in j
he half-mile run.
Cliff Halstead's time of 4:28.2 I
(gainst California in the mile run '
vas no true indication of the Tro- |
an star's ability, since last year |
lalstead ran 4:19. Hammatt, third j
slaco winner last year, and Shine,
ire the other Trojan milers, but they i
vill be lucky to get more than a j
mint between them.
A slow 10:02.2 was Earl Callahan's j
ime in beating Lee of California in j

the two mile, but 9:42, Callahan's
best 1931 mark, more nearly gauges i
what Ollie Amdahl, Stanford's fast
improving two-miler, may expect '
when the two tangle. Paul Aeber- I
sold and Art Azevedo, and Ashcraft
of U.S.C. will fight for third in this
race.
Payne Back In Hurdles
This season Dean Cromwell has |
brought two hurdle men out of re
tirement, Jeddy Welsh and Jimmy <
Payne. Welsh, who last ran for the !
Trojans in 1930, skims the high i
hurdles in 14.8, with Trojan Joe Bills I
as his chief competition so far this )
year. Payne, drawn from the team of
1928, is running low hurdles faster i
than anyone in the country, beating I
out his own teammate, Bill Carls. '
What these men do against Gus j
Meier of Stanford may mean vie- '
tory or defeat for the Thundering |
Herd.
Dink Templeton believes that Bill 1
Graber of U.S.C. is the greatest pole- j
vaulter in America. He has gone |
above 14 feet, and what is more, is
known as a competitive athlete.
Pete Chlentzos, U.S.C.'s other good !
pole vaulter is consistent at 13 feet.
High Jumps? Ouch!
The individual records of U.S.C. ;
high jumpers need no comment: Bob |
Van Osdei, 6 feet, 7 1-8 inches, Jim
Stewart, G feet, 6 1-2 inchcs, Jim
Brannon, 6 feet, 5 1-2 inches, Mal
com McNaughton, 6 feet, 4 inches, 1

Donald Norcross, 6 feet, 3 1-2 inchcs.
Stanford's best high jumper, Bob i
Jones, has cleared 6 feet, 1 inch this j
year.
Dick Barber, the peer not only of '
Trojan, but of all college broad |
jumpers, can leap over 25 feet if >
necessary, while Howard Paul, John- !
son, McFadden, and Van Riper are j
capable of 23 feet, but are not con
sistent above 22 feet, 6 inches.
Dean Cromwell's first surprise
package of the year we can |
be sure there'll be many moi - e) is
Heuston Harper, who threw the 16- j
pound shot 49 feet in the California
meet. His teammate, the veteran!
Bob Hall is a slow developer, but j
will be crowding 50 feet when he |
tangles with Messrs. Gray, Lyman, |
and Laborde.
Hall is the only worthy Trojan :
discus tlirower, and he has not sur
passed 147 feet this year, but com
petition may add distance to this j
mark on April 30.
Frank Williamson, 19(5 feet, and i
Kenneth MacKenzie, 194 feet, are the ,
U.S.C. javelin throwers. Last year
MacKenzie tossed the spear a few
feet further than A1 Ray to con
tribute a big part of his team's 09-
02 victory.

fought for in this same Olympic j

With the intercollegiate dual meet

Dean Cromwell and Dink Temple- |
ton will lift the veil of secrecy coV- j
ering the early season performances j
of their men. For it is no secret !
that U.S.C. runners and jumpers
have been "under cover," and have
yet to turn in times and distances
approaching performances which
may be expected from them on April |
30.
WvkofV Entry Doubtful
Although pressed ever closer for ;
honors by a great crop of collegiate j
sprinters, Frankie Wykoff is still the |
"Fastest Human." But whether !
Frankie will ever again reach the j
1930 and 1931 form that carried him j
to a new world's record of 9.4 for j
100 yards, is problematical. A badly |
torn muscle, incurred while broad j
jumping at Glendale High, mended
temporarily, and for years appeared |
definitely cured. But today, on the
verge of what should have been his |
greatest season, WykofY again feels j
the ellect of his injury.
It is not vet certain whether or not '
Wykofl' will line up for the 100-yard j
d;;sh in the Olympic Stadium against
Stanford sprinters, but if he does, |
he will have to come close to his
best time to beat out Leslie Ball, Alf
Koenig, and Roy Delby, his team- j
mates, and Lcs Hables of Stanford, j
Two Leslies Meet
It's a tossup between the two
Leslies in the furlong, with Ball and
Hables both 21.3 men, while Delby, j
with a record of 21.4, will be press- j
ing the two rivals for honors.
As understudy to Vic Williams in '
the 440, Art Woessner, the best U.S.C. j
quarter-miler, was developed slowly, j
but with an eye to filling Williams j
shoes adequately. Today, Woessner !
looms as the greatest college quar- j
ter-miler, barring, of course, Stan- I
ford's own Eastman. Woessner may I
go under 48 seconds, in trailing
Eastman home, but his chances of
victory are remote. Ablowich and j
Cuthrie, sophomores, are both 49
second men, and will be battling
with Stanford's hard luck captain, j
Ike Hables, and Frank Lombardi fori
the odd point in the 440 and odd j

Dean Cromwell's first surprise
package of the year we can |

Heuston Harper, who threw the 16- j
pound shot 49 feet in the California
meet. His teammate, the veteran!
Bob Hall is a slow developer, but j
will be crowding 50 feet when he |
tangles with Messrs. Gray, Lyman, |
and Laborde.
Hall is the only worthy Trojan :
discus tlirower, and he has not sur
passed 147 feet this year, but com
petition may add distance to this j
mark on April 30.
Frank Williamson, 19(5 feet, and i
Kenneth MacKenzie, 194 feet, are the ,
U.S.C. javelin throwers. Last year
MacKenzie tossed the spear a few
feet further than A1 Ray to con
tribute a big part of his team's 09-
02 victory.

charge at international honors to be j
fought for in this same Olympic j

With the intercollegiate dual meet
track championship at stake, Coaches I
Dean Cromwell and Dink Temple- |
ton will lift the veil of secrecy coV- j
ering the early season performances j
of their men. For it is no secret !
that U.S.C. runners and jumpers
have been "under cover," and have
yet to turn in times and distances
approaching performances which
may be expected from them on April |
30.
WvkofV Entry Doubtful
Although pressed ever closer for ;
honors by a great crop of collegiate j
sprinters, Frankie Wykoff is still the |
"Fastest Human." But whether !
Frankie will ever again reach the j
1930 and 1931 form that carried him j
to a new world's record of 9.4 for j
100 yards, is problematical. A badly |
torn muscle, incurred while broad j
jumping at Glendale High, mended
temporarily, and for years appeared |
definitely cured. But today, on the
verge of what should have been his |
greatest season, WykofY again feels j
the ellect of his injury.
It is not vet certain whether or not '
Wykofl' will line up for the 100-yard j
d;;sh in the Olympic Stadium against
Stanford sprinters, but if he does, |
he will have to come close to his
best time to beat out Leslie Ball, Alf
Koenig, and Roy Delby, his team- j
mates, and Lcs Hables of Stanford, j
Two Leslies Meet
It's a tossup between the two
Leslies in the furlong, with Ball and
Hables both 21.3 men, while Delby, j
with a record of 21.4, will be press- j
ing the two rivals for honors.
As understudy to Vic Williams in '
the 440, Art Woessner, the best U.S.C. j
quarter-miler, was developed slowly, j
but with an eye to filling Williams j
shoes adequately. Today, Woessner !
looms as the greatest college quar- j
ter-miler, barring, of course, Stan- I
ford's own Eastman. Woessner may I
go under 48 seconds, in trailing
Eastman home, but his chances of
victory are remote. Ablowich and j
Cuthrie, sophomores, are both 49
second men, and will be battling
with Stanford's hard luck captain, j
Ike Hables, and Frank Lombardi fori
the odd point in the 440 and odd j
points will be big things on April j
30 - . .
Eastman Certain Winner
With Eastman set aside as certain j
vvinner, U.S.C. with Dick Wehncr, j
•3i 11 McGeah, and Roger Foore, will I
;et out to take second and third in j
he half-mile run.
Cliff Halstead's time of 4:28.2 I
(gainst California in the mile run '
vas no true indication of the Tro- |
an star's ability, since last year |
lalstead ran 4:19. Hammatt, third j
slaco winner last year, and Shine,
ire the other Trojan milers, but they i
vill be lucky to get more than a j
mint between them.
A slow 10:02.2 was Earl Callahan's j
ime in beating Lee of California in j

the two mile, but 9:42, Callahan's
best 1931 mark, more nearly gauges i
what Ollie Amdahl, Stanford's fast
improving two-miler, may expect '
when the two tangle. Paul Aeber- I
sold and Art Azevedo, and Ashcraft
of U.S.C. will fight for third in this
race.
Payne Back In Hurdles
This season Dean Cromwell has |
brought two hurdle men out of re
tirement, Jeddy Welsh and Jimmy <
Payne. Welsh, who last ran for the !
Trojans in 1930, skims the high i
hurdles in 14.8, with Trojan Joe Bills I
as his chief competition so far this )
year. Payne, drawn from the team of
1928, is running low hurdles faster i
than anyone in the country, beating I
out his own teammate, Bill Carls. '
What these men do against Gus j
Meier of Stanford may mean vie- '
tory or defeat for the Thundering |
Herd.
Dink Templeton believes that Bill 1
Graber of U.S.C. is the greatest pole- j
vaulter in America. He has gone |
above 14 feet, and what is more, is
known as a competitive athlete.
Pete Chlentzos, U.S.C.'s other good !
pole vaulter is consistent at 13 feet.

Jones, has cleared 6 feet, 1 inch this j
year.
Dick Barber, the peer not only of '

It's a tossup between the two
Leslies in the furlong, with Ball and
Hables both 21.3 men, while Delby, j
with a record of 21.4, will be press- j
ing the two rivals for honors.
As understudy to Vic Williams in '
the 440, Art Woessner, the best U.S.C. j
quarter-miler, was developed slowly, j
but with an eye to filling Williams j
shoes adequately. Today, Woessner !
looms as the greatest college quar- j
ter-miler, barring, of course, Stan- I
ford's own Eastman. Woessner may I
go under 48 seconds, in trailing
Eastman home, but his chances of
victory are remote. Ablowich and j
Cuthrie, sophomores, are both 49
second men, and will be battling
with Stanford's hard luck captain, j
Ike Hables, and Frank Lombardi fori
the odd point in the 440 and odd j
points will be big things on April j
30 - . .
Eastman Certain Winner
With Eastman set aside as certain j
vvinner, U.S.C. with Dick Wehncr, j
•3i 11 McGeah, and Roger Foore, will I
;et out to take second and third in j
he half-mile run.
Cliff Halstead's time of 4:28.2 I
(gainst California in the mile run '
vas no true indication of the Tro- |
an star's ability, since last year |
lalstead ran 4:19. Hammatt, third j
slaco winner last year, and Shine,
ire the other Trojan milers, but they i
vill be lucky to get more than a j
mint between them.
A slow 10:02.2 was Earl Callahan's j
ime in beating Lee of California in j

the two mile, but 9:42, Callahan's
best 1931 mark, more nearly gauges i
what Ollie Amdahl, Stanford's fast
improving two-miler, may expect '
when the two tangle. Paul Aeber- I
sold and Art Azevedo, and Ashcraft
of U.S.C. will fight for third in this
race.
Payne Back In Hurdles
This season Dean Cromwell has |
brought two hurdle men out of re
tirement, Jeddy Welsh and Jimmy <
Payne. Welsh, who last ran for the !
Trojans in 1930, skims the high i
hurdles in 14.8, with Trojan Joe Bills I
as his chief competition so far this )
year. Payne, drawn from the team of
1928, is running low hurdles faster i
than anyone in the country, beating I
out his own teammate, Bill Carls. '
What these men do against Gus j
Meier of Stanford may mean vie- '
tory or defeat for the Thundering |
Herd.
Dink Templeton believes that Bill 1
Graber of U.S.C. is the greatest pole- j
vaulter in America. He has gone |
above 14 feet, and what is more, is
known as a competitive athlete.
Pete Chlentzos, U.S.C.'s other good !
pole vaulter is consistent at 13 feet.
High Jumps? Ouch!
The individual records of U.S.C. ;
high jumpers need no comment: Bob |
Van Osdei, 6 feet, 7 1-8 inches, Jim
Stewart, G feet, 6 1-2 inchcs, Jim
Brannon, 6 feet, 5 1-2 inches, Mal
com McNaughton, 6 feet, 4 inches, 1

Donald Norcross, 6 feet, 3 1-2 inchcs.
Stanford's best high jumper, Bob i
Jones, has cleared 6 feet, 1 inch this j
year.
Dick Barber, the peer not only of '
Trojan, but of all college broad |
jumpers, can leap over 25 feet if >
necessary, while Howard Paul, John- !
son, McFadden, and Van Riper are j
capable of 23 feet, but are not con
sistent above 22 feet, 6 inches.
Dean Cromwell's first surprise
package of the year we can |
be sure there'll be many moi - e) is
Heuston Harper, who threw the 16- j
pound shot 49 feet in the California
meet. His teammate, the veteran!
Bob Hall is a slow developer, but j
will be crowding 50 feet when he |
tangles with Messrs. Gray, Lyman, |
and Laborde.
Hall is the only worthy Trojan :
discus tlirower, and he has not sur
passed 147 feet this year, but com
petition may add distance to this j
mark on April 30.
Frank Williamson, 19(5 feet, and i
Kenneth MacKenzie, 194 feet, are the ,
U.S.C. javelin throwers. Last year
MacKenzie tossed the spear a few
feet further than A1 Ray to con
tribute a big part of his team's 09-
02 victory.
