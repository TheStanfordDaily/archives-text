# BROTHER ACTS ARE FEATURES OF STAR CARO TRACK TEAMS
## Two Each Of Eastmans, Blackmans, Hables On Track Squads 
### 
Lean, loose-jointed, laughing East
mans — short, serious-appearing,
sun-tanned Hables—big, scholarly, {
hard-working Blackmails—this val- |
uable sextette combines to put on i
one of the most imposing brother
acts in American athletics.
Running on the Stanford cinder j
squads, the fraternal six contribute
five stars to the varsity and one to i
the freshman track team —strength
without which Card hopes of a sur- j
prise Little Big Meet victory and a !
new Big Meet high-scoring mark |
would go glimmering.
Which Is Which?
The Hables have for two years j
been the most famous speed-burn- j
ing brothers in the country. Alvin [
Hables, who answers to the name of j
Ike upon occasion, captains the In- i
dians and ranks among the nation's !
best in the quarter-mile. Brother '
Les, who, to straighten out a nomen- i
clature puzzle that has bothered ,
sports writers and the poor sport
loving public lor quite some little j
while, is nicknamed Abe, is the j
most versatile of Templeton's stal- j
warts, being a sprinter and 440 star j
us well.
Sam and Ben
Ben Eastman—the straw-thatched |
skyscraper of the Indian spike:-.men j
—is the most famous trackman of j
his day, having set two world's rec- j
ords within the short space of two
weeks. Frater Sam, bothered by in- j
juries this season, has not lived up !
to the promise he showed in early !
season workouts, but if he gets in |
shape m:iy show Jim Ferrie a thing ;
or two about running the mile. Sam !
has a half-miling complex, and
hopes some day to put his more- |
noted brother in his place in the 880. i
Don Blackmail Versatile
Don B ackman has been a varsity I
high-jumper for two years, with j
occasion 1 trials at the 440, the 220, j
and the low hurdles. A1 Blackman. j
the only yearling among the six, is j
the undisputed star of the frosh j
tracksters, and his sprinting may j
some day carry him past the best |
marks of Hec Dyer, Les Hables and j
other noted Cardinal clashmen.
Templeton's wizardry has made
this triple duo what it is today.
Captain Alvin came to Stanford as!
a sprinter and is now, with another j
Ilables, Ben Eastman, and Maynor i
Shove, the holder of the world's |
mile relay record.
Les Former Half-Miler
L'le Leslie was a half - rniler, |
broacl-jumper, miler, and sprinter J
of note when he enrolled in the ;
Farm's course of Developing Track j
Stars, and now he has become a
dash - man and quarter - miler of
Olympic caliber. Dun Blackman j
came here as a hurdler and took un !
high-jumping when his arches took ;
a tumble.
Ben Eastman was a mediocre 440
man, but since he first appeared !
with his unruly hair and glasses |
has shattered the world's record in
this event by a full second. Sam was j
nothing when he first arrived, while !
A1 Bl: tclcman alone among the six i
came and remained a sprinter.

his day, having set two world's rec- j
ords within the short space of two
weeks. Frater Sam, bothered by in- j
juries this season, has not lived up !
to the promise he showed in early !
season workouts, but if he gets in |
shape m:iy show Jim Ferrie a thing ;
or two about running the mile. Sam !
has a half-miling complex, and
hopes some day to put his more- |
noted brother in his place in the 880. i
Don Blackmail Versatile
Don B ackman has been a varsity I
high-jumper for two years, with j
occasion 1 trials at the 440, the 220, j
and the low hurdles. A1 Blackman. j
the only yearling among the six, is j
the undisputed star of the frosh j
tracksters, and his sprinting may j
some day carry him past the best |
marks of Hec Dyer, Les Hables and j
other noted Cardinal clashmen.
Templeton's wizardry has made
this triple duo what it is today.
Captain Alvin came to Stanford as!
a sprinter and is now, with another j
Ilables, Ben Eastman, and Maynor i
Shove, the holder of the world's |
mile relay record.
Les Former Half-Miler
L'le Leslie was a half - rniler, |
broacl-jumper, miler, and sprinter J
of note when he enrolled in the ;
Farm's course of Developing Track j
Stars, and now he has become a
dash - man and quarter - miler of
Olympic caliber. Dun Blackman j
came here as a hurdler and took un !
high-jumping when his arches took ;
a tumble.
Ben Eastman was a mediocre 440
man, but since he first appeared !
with his unruly hair and glasses |
has shattered the world's record in
this event by a full second. Sam was j
nothing when he first arrived, while !
A1 Bl: tclcman alone among the six i
came and remained a sprinter.
Lean, loose-jointed, laughing East
mans — short, serious-appearing,
sun-tanned Hables—big, scholarly, {
hard-working Blackmails—this val- |
uable sextette combines to put on i
one of the most imposing brother
acts in American athletics.
Running on the Stanford cinder j
squads, the fraternal six contribute
five stars to the varsity and one to i
the freshman track team —strength
without which Card hopes of a sur- j
prise Little Big Meet victory and a !
new Big Meet high-scoring mark |
would go glimmering.
Which Is Which?
The Hables have for two years j
been the most famous speed-burn- j
ing brothers in the country. Alvin [
Hables, who answers to the name of j
Ike upon occasion, captains the In- i
dians and ranks among the nation's !
best in the quarter-mile. Brother '
Les, who, to straighten out a nomen- i
clature puzzle that has bothered ,
sports writers and the poor sport
loving public lor quite some little j
while, is nicknamed Abe, is the j
most versatile of Templeton's stal- j
warts, being a sprinter and 440 star j
us well.
