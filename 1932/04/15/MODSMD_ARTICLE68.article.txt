mark him for a man apart.
Ikon Major
Majoring in economics, with an j
eye to business school, Eastman has '
not yet decided what he is studying ]
toward, except to be definitely— \
"Not a bond-salesman."
Structural geology, and South j
America, are two courses in which
he admits appreciable enjoyment. j
Term papers he has "frequently and j
luckily escaped." He takes bulky.
lecture-notes. And he prefers to I
study by himself, rather than in gre- I
garious and chatty bull-sessions be- j
fore an ex.
Of neither the wind in his face j
nor the spasm of his legs is Ben j
aware when he is running.
"Mental Blankness"
Answer to the favorite query of
"What Ben thinks about?" comes as 1
a stray bit of interesting psychology, j
"Running is a sort of mental
blankness, after the gun goes off,"
Ben Eastman says. "Before the
race I try to plan what I'm go- !
ing to do. After it starts, thinking
turns into an emptiness, with any
meaningless phrase I may have
heard somewhere, jumping into ,
my mind."
When a racer passes him —improb-
able and rare occasion—Ben fights i
down impulse, in order to remember |
what his coach has said. "Dink has
told me not to hurry up in front j
again." he rehearses, "but to save
for a fast finish." j

He was not conscious of having
sped past two world's records, East
man says. It was a pleasant feeling,
he admits, and his own surprise was
reflected on those occasions by the
Cheshire Cat grin which appeared
and reappeared for almost half an
hour afterward. Though it is ex
pected to take far longer for the
lung-ripping huzzahs of Stanford
University to die away.
