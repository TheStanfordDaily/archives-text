When Harry Maloney took Ben
Eastman and the rest of the Stan
ford track stars East last spring for
the I.C. 4-A.'s at Harvard, he intro
duced Ben to an old friend of Ma
loney's—Ted Meredith.
Meredith at that time held the
recognized world's record in the
quarter-mile at 47.4 seconds and was
the former holder of the world's
half-mile record.
"I'd like you to meet a friend of
mine, Ted," said Maloney, "who is
going to break your 440 record some
time soon."
"Glad to meet you, Ben," answered
Meredith.
Then Pennsylvania's great Ted
watched Stanford's great Ben run,
and confided to Maloney that East
man had a good chance to make
Moloney's prophecy come true.
Less than a year later, Eastman
did shatter Meredith's mark—by a
full second.
