mg, water polo, tennis, and gym
istic teams left here last night
lile the golf squad left Wednes
y night and competed in the team
ampionships yesterday on the Bel
r country club course.
Fencers Unbeaten
Stanford's unbeaten fencing team
11 go up against the best saber
in that U.C.L.A., California, or
S.C. has to offer in the finals. Cap
ri Len Pockman, Jim Reed, and
m Pockman are the Cardinal rep
ent a lives. The team captain is
? Bay Region champion, while
ed was third in the open meet of
s division.
The eliminations and finals of the
1 competition will be conducted
norrow at U.C.L.A., with Len
clcman, Dick Criley, and John
rguson entered for Stanford. The
round-rgbin is scheduled the
ne afternoon, and the two Pock
ns and Fred Pearman will en
ivor to repeat their northern Cali
nia successes in this event.
U.S.C., S.C. Strong
jymnastic performers will go
ough the finals in their events at
j.C. today. Stanford's gym team,
ieh took a 46-44 beating at the
ids of California earlier in the
son, has little hope of winning
, as U.S.C. and California have
st of the strength.
Captain Sam Clark is the out
riding Stanford entry. Although
won four first places and scored
points in the Bear clash, his
nces of repeating are practically
jossible.
ack Pike, who is entered in all
nts, should garner a few points,
ile the rest of the team may
tribute to the total. Bob Kemp,
the Indian club and tumbling on
rings, helps the balance of the
ad.
