# Esterley Speaks On Combining Of Marriage, Career
## 
### 
Speaking last night in the Wom
en's Clubholse before a good-sized
audience, Mrs. Virginia Judy Es
terley discussed "Vocations and
Marriage." Her conclusion was that
marriage and a career can success
fully be combined, provided that the
career is at all times kept subordi
nate to the home. A wife's vocation
must be limited, said the speaker, in
order for her married life to be
completely happy.
Mrs. Esterley recommended that
college women prepare for their
callings while in college and then
that they marry soon after their
graduation. The career should be
deferred for a few years, and the
children launched on their educa
tion before the planned-for career
should be considered.
This vocation should be one which
is definitely a woman's work- in
which women have been successful
for a number of yearsâ€”one which
better fit the wife for her duties as
a mother.
