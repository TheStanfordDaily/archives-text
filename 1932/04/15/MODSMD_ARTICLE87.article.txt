# U.C. PINS HOPE ON KIESEL, DE BERRY IN SPRINTS, SNOT
## Bear Stars' Past Records Point To Good Chance For Victories 
### A. J. G 
When 1 hiit famously impartial ob
server of intercollegiate athletics, j
"Brick" Morse, recently conceded
that the Bear could not score more ;
than fifty points in tomorrow's Big j
Meet, shaded ghosts of past Cali- {
fornia championship track teams j
threw up their bones in despair and j
returned to their graves in antique:
California yearbooks.
But when Morse went on to ex- 1
plain that although a Blue and Gold I
defeat was imminent, the chances j
of Simpson, Miller, and Wyke shut
ting out Ben Eastman in the 440
were excellent, a few of the one-time j
Bear champions who had not yet j
reached the warmer side of the j
Styx, stayed their oars, and when j
the red-headed sports writer in
sisted that Bob Kiesel and Fred De-
Berry would win. their specialties i
from Indian challengers, a few of'
the less dubious departed ones |
turned their ships back towards j
misty Berkeley shores, the while in—»j
termixing carols of "All Hail, Blue j
and Gold" with the more familiar '
"Hate Stanford."
Kiesel Good Bet
Although we disagree with Morse,
(being of the opinion that Blazin'
Ben will nose out Wyke for a third 1
in the 440), we agree with the Call-
Bulletin in believing that "Bullet
Bob" has an excellent chance of
placing high in the dashes and that
Deßerry will prove a dangerous
threat to Stanford's iron men in the j
shot and discus.
Back in IS2B, when thp sectional ;
Olympic tryouts were being held
at Stanford, great interest was cen- ,
tcred on the 100 and 200 meter
events since Russ Sweet, Montana's j
great champion, was competing in \
these events. Bob Kiesel, a sopho- j
more at Tamalpais High School at !
the time, was one of many unheard- j
of hopeless prospects entered in the
two dashes, yet he astounded Ihc
crowd by beating Sweet in both j
races.
Past Kciscl Records
In the fall of 1030, Kiesel enrolled
at California, and celebrated his en
try into collegiate competition by
winning the Little Big Meet 100- \
yard clash in 9.9 seconds.
After lie had taken several 100's j
and 220's this season in 9.7 and 21.4, >
a much built-up race occurred be- j
tween "Bullet Bob" and Frankic I
WykofT, the latest U.S.C. "Fastest j
Human." WykofT won the 100 by a '
foot after coming from behind, and .
then declined to run ihe 220. Last
week Kiesel climaxed his season's j
performances by equalling Wykoff's '
recognized record of 9.5 for 100 I
yards.
Deßerry Docs 50 Feet
Big Fred Deßerry is the other
Californian on whom fellow students j
are pinning hopes and betting shirts, j
After several years of shot-putting 1
devoid of any real improvement, this j
new star on the rather dim Cali
fornia horizon has developed into j
the greatest shot putter in the his
-lory of Blue and Gold track. His
most recent mark of 49 feet, 9 1-2
inches exceeds records made by :
every Stanford man except Nellie >
Gray, who pushed the iron ball 50 j
feet, 2 inches in the meet against ;
the Olympic Club and San Fran- |
ci.sco University. Deßerry himself \
has done 50 feet in practice on more j
than one occasion.
Bill Miller, stellar Stanford pole- '
vaulter, held the world's interschol- j
astic pole-vault record while attend- !
ing San Diego High School.
