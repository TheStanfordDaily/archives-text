19 31 MADE HISTORY IN SHIP ELECTRIFICATION
*■ — •• *--*
BECAUSE the combined horsepower of turbine-electric equipment in
stalled and now in process of construction passed the one million mark
during the year. BECAUSE the President Hoover, first all-electric ship built in
America for commercial transoceanic service, completed its first round trip to
Asiatic ports. BECAUSE the Talamatica, the first of the largest electrically
propelled fleet ever laid down, was delivered to its owners. BECAUSE elec
trification —an American contribution to marine transportation—was adopted
by the leading shipbuilding countries of the world. BECAUSE, on the high
seas and on inland waterways, electrically propelled ships established new
records for speed and continuous operation. • General Electric engineers
not only pioneered the application of electric propulsion, but have made
many contributions to its development during the last two decades. By the
complete electrification of the President Hoover, and the six new ships of the
United Fruit Company's fleet, college-trained General Electric engineers have
made another striking contribution to American shipbuilding and world trade.
