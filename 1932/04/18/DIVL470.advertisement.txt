advertised products
The increased importance of well-directed
advertising during times of depression is
recognized by successful business men
everywhere. . During such periods, the buy
ing habits of the public must be more
strictly regulated. Advertising is the one
agent that can do this efficiently. The fol
lowing statements will illlustrate this point.
Milton Dammann, president of American
Safety Razor Corporation â€” When the de
pression fastened its grip upon the world's
business we doubled our efforts to perfect
our merchandise and to impress this fact
upon our buying public. We did not stint
our advertising outlay, but examined with
a critical eye where we placed our copy. We
wanted to be sure to spend our money in
the right direction and that there would be
no waste.
Richard C. Harrison, president, White Rock
Mineral Springs Company - It may interest
you to know that with the approach of
slack times we decided that White Rock
products have become so thoroughly stand
ardized in demand that we were safe in
increasing our advertising appropriation
and our sales effort. The advertising ex
penditure was increased approximately 10
per cent with very gratifying results.
