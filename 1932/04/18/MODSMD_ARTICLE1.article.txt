## Says He Was Holding Gun, Quizzing Native, When Mind Went Blank BARES KIDNAP PLANS Strain Of Trial Begins To Leave Marks 
### 
HONOLULU, April 17. (/P) —Hav-
ing shouldered the blame for the
killing of Joseph Kahahawai, Lieu
tenant Thomas H. Massie rested to
day preparatory to undergoing a
grilling at the hands of Honolulu's
vigorous young prosecutor, John C.
Kelley.
Tomorrow Kelley planned to ex
tend his gentle and persuasive but
dangerous cross-examination.
The strain of the trial, now only a
fortnight old, has begun to leave in
delible scars on Mrs. Granville
Fortescue and Massie, who is 27
years old.
Admitted Attack
The young naval officer climaxed
his story yesterday by saying he
confronted Kahahawai with a pistol
in the home of Mrs. Fortescue and
that his mind went blank when
Kahahawai allegedly admitted par
ticipating in a criminal attack on
Mrs. Massie.
He told how he and Mrs. Fortescue
his mother-in-law and co-defend
ant, had plotted Kahahawai's ab
duction, aided by the other de
fendants, E. J. Lord and Albert O.
Jones, and how the ruse had been
carried out by which Kahahawai
had been brought to the Fortescue
ionic.
"Yes. We Done It"
Picturing himself as holding u
.oistol and facing Kahahawai, Massie
asserted the native suddenly said:
"Yes, we done it."
"That's all I remember," said
Massie. "All I could see was my
.vife and hear what she told me—
hat when Kahahawai attacked her
md she prayed for mercy he an
swered by breaking her jaw."
Massie said he remembered
lothing thereafter until he was
aken to the police station.
