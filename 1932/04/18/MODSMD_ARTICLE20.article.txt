Old Man Depression is one of the
; few in Vienna who hasn't joined the !
j ranks of the unemployed, and lie j
i works overtime, intimated Dr. Paul
j Dangler, Austrian educator, who
visited the campus last week.
Austria is experiencing a double '
1 depression, said Denglcr. "We feel
; the general, world-wide bad times,
and we also have our own little per-
I sonal depression."
The intellectual class especially is ,
1 having difficulty finding employment j
I in Europe, according to the director 1
i of the Austro-American Institute of i
Education. There arc over 100,000 ,
J Doctors of Philosophy in Germany
without work: college students con
tinuing to study indefinitely after

graduation, since it is almost impos
sible to secure a position.
American literature, plays, movies,
styles, and music are over-running
central Europe, and this is a good
thing, in the opinion (if Dengler,
except that the American influence
is eliminating the picturesque native
customs.
War-feeling against America no
longer exists in any of the countries
which fought for the Central Pow
ers; in fact, according to Dengler,
there never was any hatred for the
United States in Austria. Exchange
students, tourists, and travelling Ro
tary Clubs are gradually dispelling
the European idea that America is
composed largely of cowboys, In
dians, negro slaves, and gangsters.
