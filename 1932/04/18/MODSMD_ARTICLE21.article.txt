# 'JAFSIE' THINKS LINDY BABE TO BE FOUND SOON
## Ad-Writer Believed To Be Only Direct Contact With Kidnapers 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., April 17. (/P)—
A reiteration of faith in h':: ability
to treat with the kidnapers of the
Lindbergh baby came today from
Dr. John F. Condon as the 72-year
old "Jafsie" spent an active Sunday
appearing as an umpire in a charity
baseball game.
'"We are in contact with the kid
napers, and the baby will be re
turned soon, 1 hope," said the re
tired educator and welfare worker
at an athletic field at City Island,
east of his New York home.
Denounces Kidnapers
This statement, voiced in the
course of a brief talk for motion
pictures, did not make clear to what
extent, if any, communication had
been re-established with the abduc
tors since payment of $50,000 ran
som on April 2 failed to effect the
child's x-ecovery.
"This is the most dastardly crime
in history, and nobody connected
with it will give up until the baby
is back," said Dr. Condon.
Position Clarified
Colonel Henry Breckinridge,
Lindbergh attorney, frequently in
company with the teacher, referred
yesterday to Dr. Condon as "the
only direct contact we have had
with the kidnapers."
The position of the Norfolk. Va.,
trio of citizens seeking the baby's
return since March 9 was clarified
somewhat last night when one of
them, Pear Admiral Guy H. Bur
rage, said they never had claimed
direct contact with the kidnapers,
but their negotiations had been with
"go betweens," whom they believed
to represent the real abductors.
