# MASQUE BALL NETS $700; PROCEEDS TO HELP CAMPUS HOME
## 
### 
Proceeds from the Masque Ball
held last Friday evening, both so
cially and economically the out
standing affair of its kind in recent
Stanford history, amounted to over
$700, according to Rally Committee
Chairman Ed Boyles yesterday.
All of the profits are to be given
to the Convalescent Home, and are
approximately $600 greater than
those of the last Ball. A total of
$502.18 was realized from the King
Contest, managed by Bob Churchill,
and a surplus of over $200 above
expenses was turned in from the
Ball itself. Two hundred ninety-four
bids were sold in advance at the
A.S.S.U. offices and 18 were sold at
the door.
