### DICK STROUSE 
A N AGED hut surprisingly agile Golden Bear up and smote a whole
tribe of rather faded red Stanford Indians for a row of three Big Meet
records in the nice new bear cage at Berkeley Saturday afternoon. Cali
fornia's Bear scored but 51 5-0 points to 7!) 1-6 for the Stanford Indians,
but since the Berkeley Bruin was doped to run up but 33 or so digits,
elderly Walt Christie, the great Berkeley coach, can mildly boast that he
ended up his great Big Meet record with an exceptional showing against
•a bclow-form Card squad.

The only records that were broken
went to Christie's athletes and the
Beax*s also excelled as "come-
I through" artists. Captain George
! Pool of California broke Ward Ed
i monds' pole-vault mark, and this
i Bob Kiesel person, as expected, car
| ried both dash marks away on his
' winged heels.
j Pool usually has had trouble
i climbing up to 12 feet 6 inches this
i year, but Saturday was one of those
j days on which he is of interna
| tional calibre. He knocked the cross
! bar off at 13 feet 8% inches on his
| way up and then knocked it back
j on again on his way down to ex
| ceed Edmonds' mark by 1% inches,
| and then tried, and nearly made, 14

Big Ben Eastman tick-tocked

j winning the 440 in 49.8 and the half
i in 1:58.8.
Paul Nash exhibited a strong
i finish to get second in the quarter,
; and Lombardi took third for one of
1 the Stanford sweeps. Eastman ran

pace was too fast for Naylon, how

j second by Bryant, one of the sur
j prising Bears.

j shot-put at 50 feet 4 7/ a inches, and
I Lyman threw the ball 49 feet 7'/;
inches, just 3 1 /[> inches behind Dc
