# UNIQUE MINERAL TO BE EXAMINED
## 
### 
Professor A. F. Rogers left jester- â€¢
day on a two days' trip to El Portal !
in Mariposa county, to observe spe- j
cimens of the new mineral, san- |
bornite, which was recently dis- i
covered there and identified by Pro
fessor Rogers. He wishes to find .
what the local country rock is, in |
order to better understand the na
ture of sanbornite.
In his article which will appear in j
the May issue of the "American j
Mineralogist.,'" Professor Rogers dc- >
scribes the new mineral as a barium
silicate mixed with quartz. Barium '
silicate has never before been found i
in nature, although it is found in i
barium glass, which is made in the
Gco-Physical laboratory in Wash
ington, D.C.
Thirty-nine new minerals have
been found in California, and in this
latest discovery there is the proba- !
bility of identifying three more min- i
orals, says Professor Rogers. |
