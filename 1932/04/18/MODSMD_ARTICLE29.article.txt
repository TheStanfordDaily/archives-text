# GOOD LUCK, CALIFORNIA!

Stanford may have* won the Rig Meet Saturday, may
have won it by a decisive margin. Anyone looking only at
the final score would he wont to remark that the Hears
were sadly outclassed that is. if lie had not known any
thing of either team before the clash.
To those who were well acquainted with the abilities of
the rival athletes, however, the fact that the total amassed
by the Indians was less than (SO points is somehow hardly
understandable.
"Moral victories" have come in for plenty of ridicule
during the past several years. That phrase has become
st. ii a favorite with sports writers (hat the general public
has become tired of it. So tired, in fact, that it doesn't stop
to realize that the phrase is still, at times, perfectly and
sincerely applicable. Saturday was one of these times.
Regardless of the score, the thirty-ninth Rig Meet was a
glorious triumph for California and for the dean of the
track coaching gentry, the veteran Walter Christie. Three
new records the Rears set in the hundred, the two twenty,
and in the pole vault. Event after event found them taking
points which nobody had foreseen points which they had
absolutely no right to claim.
Perhaps it was because the coach whose very name has
become a part of their university was making his farewell
thrust at the Indians after .'U years of service. Perhaps that
is what gave them the light that would not be denied.
At any rate, it is with a certain degree of regret that
Stanford sees Walt Christie retire. Fifteen times he beat
Stanford, and only lack of material has kept him from
coming through during the past eight lean Rluc and Cold
yea rs.
Whoever takes his place, whoever steps into the shoes
of the dean of them all he will be a fortunate man. For
the Rears are definitely on the up-grade. From now on,
Rig Meets will be Rig Meets closer than ever before to
toss-ups.
Good luck, California.
