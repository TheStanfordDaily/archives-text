# LET NO RED DEFILE THAT "C"
## 
### 
Those zealous California hoys seared away another
Stanford bogy-man last week. Evidently haunted by fear
some ghosts of the old Axe raids, Berkeley sophomores
mounted guard over the Big "C" to prevent any of the
ferocious Indians from painting that cherished symbol red.
Arc lamps lighted the approaches, while lights of the
sacred yellow color blinked warningly about the over
grown letter itself.
Of course it is interesting to see that Californians still
retain some of the far-famed "Hate Stanford" spirit, but
the boys might have saved themselves a lot of trouble by
exercising the >id cerebrum a trifle. To call forth out
bursts of inter-campus raiding an athletic event must be
sufficiently uncertain or important to produce strong inter
est and c '"incut on the part of the collegians concerned.
By no sti tit n of the imagination could the outcome of Sat
urday's Big Meet be called uncertain, although the decisive
Cardinal victory was not as crushing as had been expected,
nor was Ihe encounter considered of major importance in
the present track season. Even the most excitable Stanford
freshman could hardly have been wrought up over that
contest to the point of organizing an invasion of Ihe I'.C.
campus.
Well, it was a grand opportunity for California to
demonstrate that the Bear was not dead but only sleeping.
Anxious alumni and agitated students can rest easy in the
assurance that, with "be prepared" as the motto of its
guardians, the Blue and Gold is safe from the touch of
profane hands.
