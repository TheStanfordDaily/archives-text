# GRADES AGAIN
## 
### 
At the rnivcrsilv of â€¢North Carolina is a professor,
Horace Williams, who boasts of having given only two A's
in his course, logic and civilization, during his 12 years of
teaching.
"The A student," he explained, "is the master of the
course, one who has been stimulated to return to philoso
phy more than il yielded him. On the other hand, a H
student is one who possesses an accurate knowledge of the
course hut is uninspired."
t'nder the ordinary system of grading this boast of
Professor Williams is more nearlv a confession.
