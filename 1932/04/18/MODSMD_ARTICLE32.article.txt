# BULL SESSION
## WILL HOOVER BE WET? 
### 
When that mixture of avalanche,
tidal wave, and landslide —otherwise
termed the "Hoover Majority" of
.1928—came pouring into the ballot
boxes, nobody could imagine the
day when it might be necessary for
the President to take a stand on
prohibition. Winners do not have to
pledge themselves to anything; all
they have to do is gather up the
votes. Losers have to make stands
in the faint hope of becoming win
ners. That is why Hoover could call
prohibition the "noble experiment"
and stop. No one need know how
his tastes in experiments ran.
But now, the Democrats have a
chance to win. Their candidate will
probably be wet —Roosevelt, Ritchie,
Reed, Lewis, Baker, Smith are wet.
Garner, the clumsy sphinx, is a
Hearst creation, and therefore would
also be anti-Prohibition. That means
that if the country is moist, the
Bourbons might win. That the
voters are rapidly becoming alco
holic in opinion as they long have
been in palate seems somewhat
likely.
The "Literary Digest" in an effort
to beat off the inroads of "Time"
has been conducting a prohibition
poll. The figures are startling. About
two to one against prohibition—and
a wet majority in every state but
Kansas—reads the score. If that
were only known to be true, the
two national parties would vie in
rapidity with each other in sub
merging their candidates and plat
forms in the nearest and deepest
beer barrel. But they don't.

The increasing deficit which will
mean increasing taxes will also be
another argument for the wets —or
"Liberals" as the Hearst press
chooses to call them. Professor Sel
igman—the darling to the economics
classes—claims that the revenue
loss due to Amendment No. 18 is no
less than one billion, five-hundred
million (eight zeros) dollars. This,
poupled with the very popular con
tention that bootleggers are getting
all this money will be potent ma
terial for the wets in November.
With the Democrats wet, Hoover
can come from behind an evasive
phrase without worrying about the
Anti-Saloon League, the Methodist
Board—or any of that ilk. While
losing their support, he would be
safe in knowing that all they could
do would be: first, rant and rage at
both major parties, or second, put
up an independent candidate. Nei
ther would do them any good, and
the loss to Hoover would be small.
One of the big dry moguls, fearing
that the President might be wet, and
anticipating then the exasperating
dilemna of the drys, has threatened
to support a wet Democrat if
Hoover even becomes damp. That,
however, is just the desperate talk
of a man suffering with arthritis and
blisters hanging on to the end of a
splitting rope. Hoover wet might
beat the Democrats in the indus
trial East where the Bourbon bid
for victory will be made. Of course,
Hoover dry might also do it.
