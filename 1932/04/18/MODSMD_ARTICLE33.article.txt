THE AMATEUR DADDY, at the
Varsity Theater
Good acting on the part of a
splendid cast makes this movie one
that shouldn't bt missed in spite of
its saccharine plot.
Ever since Mary Pickford started
the racket, the American movie
public has sat entranced through lit
erally thousands of pictures wherein
the muchly troubled orphan with a
family of cute but dirty brothers
and sisters on her hands finally is
able, with the aid of a handsome,
kind benefactor, to pay the mort
gage and to marry the handsome
one. The only change that time has
brought to this plot is the increase
in size of the family. In "Daddy
Longlegs" they had to introduce an
orphan asylum to make the num
ber of children at all probable.
In "The Amateur Daddy" the re
turn to the small family plan is a
happy indication, probably brought
on by the depression. Hollywood has
to be complimented for overlooking
a wonderful opportunity in this pic
ture to have the benefactor wrongly
accused of murder, and for not
ending the thing with a clinch—so
you see it is unusual and should be
seen. The shorts were good, too.

ROGUE MERRIES—By Hugh Wal
polc. Doubleday, Doran & Co.
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Store.)
A devil with the women and a
heartless rogue, he was. He scorned
all mankind, and mankind hated
him. He sold his mistress; he killed
his wife by his neglect; but, despite
all, Rogue Herries was loyal to his
ideals.
Women could not resist him, but
with age he found his old fascina
tion gone. The one woman he sin
cerely loved existed only for a dead
lover. He tasted of the bitterness he
had given to so many. His wife left
him, and for five long years he
searched throughout England for
her.
His tall, bent figure and tragic
scarred face became legendary.
Women hushed their babies with
tales of his witchcraft. His search
was in vain, and he fell mortally ill.
The book ends happily enough,
and those who like their stories
well-sexed will enjoy it. A.L.A.
CALL HER SAVAGE — Tiffany
Thayer. (Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Tiffany Thayer again proves him
self a daring and revolutionary au
thor in this poignant novel of the
life and ancestry of a half-breed
Texan heiress.
The story, in brief, is that of

[Nasa, savage, primitive, daughter
Jof a pioneer woman and a full
| blooded Indian, who is raised by
| her mother's legitimate husband as
his own daughter. The family, be-
I come wealthy through the rail
j roads, moves to Chicago, where
| Nasa, now a debutante, scandalizes
j all and sundry by her unconven
tional behavior. To foil her par
ents, whom she hates for restrain
ing her, Nasa marries the debauched
j son of millions. A divorce soon fol
| lows, and Nasa, now the mother of
| a son, enters upon a wild career of
! sordid love - affairs. Her mother's
| death calls Nasa back to Texas,
! where her father also soon dies. In
! Texas she meets again her child
! hood Indian lover, whom she prom
! ises to marry following his return
from the World War.
Again Thayer proves himself an
| able psychologist in his portrait of
! this primitive girl. Proud, untamed,
savage she remains even in her
j degradation, reaping her own pe
culiar revenge, flaunting, ignoring
society, her own turbulent life ruled
, by primitive loves and hates.
"Call Her Savage" differs from
! the author's more recent "The
j Greek" in that it is a stirring and
I eminently human novel rather than
jan imaginary, political satire. How
| ever, both are replete with Thayer's
| daring, and audacity.
You will like "Call Her Savage"
| for its frankness and force.

CALL HER SAVAGE — Tiffany
Thayer. (Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Tiffany Thayer again proves him
self a daring and revolutionary au
thor in this poignant novel of the
life and ancestry of a half-breed
Texan heiress.
The story, in brief, is that of

[Nasa, savage, primitive, daughter
Jof a pioneer woman and a full
| blooded Indian, who is raised by
| her mother's legitimate husband as
his own daughter. The family, be-
I come wealthy through the rail
j roads, moves to Chicago, where
| Nasa, now a debutante, scandalizes
j all and sundry by her unconven
tional behavior. To foil her par
ents, whom she hates for restrain
ing her, Nasa marries the debauched
j son of millions. A divorce soon fol
| lows, and Nasa, now the mother of
| a son, enters upon a wild career of
! sordid love - affairs. Her mother's
| death calls Nasa back to Texas,
! where her father also soon dies. In
! Texas she meets again her child
! hood Indian lover, whom she prom
! ises to marry following his return
from the World War.
Again Thayer proves himself an
| able psychologist in his portrait of
! this primitive girl. Proud, untamed,
savage she remains even in her
j degradation, reaping her own pe
culiar revenge, flaunting, ignoring
society, her own turbulent life ruled
, by primitive loves and hates.
"Call Her Savage" differs from
! the author's more recent "The
j Greek" in that it is a stirring and
I eminently human novel rather than
jan imaginary, political satire. How
| ever, both are replete with Thayer's
| daring, and audacity.
You will like "Call Her Savage"
| for its frankness and force.

THE AMATEUR DADDY, at the
Varsity Theater
Good acting on the part of a
splendid cast makes this movie one
that shouldn't bt missed in spite of
its saccharine plot.
Ever since Mary Pickford started
the racket, the American movie
public has sat entranced through lit
erally thousands of pictures wherein
the muchly troubled orphan with a
family of cute but dirty brothers
and sisters on her hands finally is
able, with the aid of a handsome,
kind benefactor, to pay the mort
gage and to marry the handsome
one. The only change that time has
brought to this plot is the increase
in size of the family. In "Daddy
Longlegs" they had to introduce an
orphan asylum to make the num
ber of children at all probable.
In "The Amateur Daddy" the re
turn to the small family plan is a
happy indication, probably brought
on by the depression. Hollywood has
to be complimented for overlooking
a wonderful opportunity in this pic
ture to have the benefactor wrongly
accused of murder, and for not
ending the thing with a clinch—so
you see it is unusual and should be
seen. The shorts were good, too.

ROGUE MERRIES—By Hugh Wal
polc. Doubleday, Doran & Co.
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Store.)
A devil with the women and a
heartless rogue, he was. He scorned
all mankind, and mankind hated
him. He sold his mistress; he killed
his wife by his neglect; but, despite
all, Rogue Herries was loyal to his
ideals.
Women could not resist him, but
with age he found his old fascina
tion gone. The one woman he sin
cerely loved existed only for a dead
lover. He tasted of the bitterness he
had given to so many. His wife left
him, and for five long years he
searched throughout England for
her.
His tall, bent figure and tragic
scarred face became legendary.
Women hushed their babies with
tales of his witchcraft. His search
was in vain, and he fell mortally ill.
The book ends happily enough,
and those who like their stories
well-sexed will enjoy it. A.L.A.
