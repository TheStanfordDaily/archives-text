## SHIRTLESS TENNIS OR THE TALE OF FADED CORDS AND TANNED CHESTS 
### 
Editor, Stanford Daily:
All honor to your colyumnist's
outraged feelings on having to re
move his cords—and himself—from
the red plush library seats. But how
about the requirement of "full
dress" on the men's tennis courts
during the hours in which the
courts are limited to men students?
Since when has the Stanford rough
gone "formal"?
At Lagunita, we may dress in less
than Ghandi wears. On any Cali
fornia beach, the sun-browned chest
is as universal a sign of California
masculinity as faded cords are a
mark of the Stanford "rough." And
yet so like a violet is this species
of rough that he must be sheltered,
in his exercise hours, from the
blushes of Victorian ladies.
And so sensitive is the Stanford
University physical training depart
ment to the tender feelings of pass
ing motorists that high-priced
coaches, as well as lesser-paid po
licemen and watchmen, spend a good
deal of their valuable time making
the rounds of the furthermost courts
to search out the devotees of sun,
exercise, and fresh air and explain
that while of course they believe in
the value of sunshine and all that
somebody or other in authority does
not.
Those who have the time and in
clination to merely lie and gaze at
Old Sol, of course, may spend end
less hours sun-bathing around the
pool. Those who must get their
violet rays with their tennis, if at
all, can get it only between "calls"
from athletic coaches, policemen,
and watchmen.
Just why a perspix'ation-covered
"upper" is to be preferred to a bare
buck in the sun by a university de
partment that is interested in the

promotion of physical well-being, it '
is not easy to set* —especially in this
land ot tanned torsos and muscular •
freedom. After all, this is 1932 and i
passing uutoists must know that j
men have chests whether they are |
covered by a sweaty shirt or ex- j
posed to sun and air. If they must
be protected from the immodest !
sight of a bare back chasing a tennis i
ball in the sun, why not close the
roads past the tennis courts and
route the tourists around by way of
Roble where nothing but decorum
will greet their sensitive sight?
Why could not the University at
least set aside those hours of the
day that are not infested with
putrid-minded tourists, say between
noon and 2 o'clock, and leave tennis
players free to broil in the actinic
rays to their skin's content.
When my partner and I arrived
at the courts a few days ago, we
found a dozen brown backs beauti
fully bounding around in the sun.
"How come?" we wanted to know,
"ain't you got no shame or have the
Victorians in the B.A.C. turned
modern?"
"Aw! Go to !"
"But the sacree rule about no
shirts, no tennis—what's happened
to it?"
"The watchman just made his
round and won't be back for another
hour, the campus cop is in court,
and hte coaches are in conferenc—
come on join the sans chemises
while the sun's hotcha!"
Thus do morals decay and scoff
laws arise in the alma mater of rug
ged individualism when those re
sponsible for the passage of laws
ignore the passage of time and
fashion.
Yours, for faded cords (but clean)
and shirt-less chsts but tanned.
