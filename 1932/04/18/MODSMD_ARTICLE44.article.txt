THAT CALIFORNIA TEAM
certainly went into the meet
with murderous intentions. Not
much room for cracks about
"moral victories" either; they
almost made it a mathematical
victory!
Felt sorry for Los Hables in that
00. If there is anyone around here
ivho has more "push,"' we don't
enow him. Sensible of Bill Elling
on not to run him in the 220.
brother Ike ran a nice lap in the
elay. Showed his hospital training
hough. If those two can get out for
i couple of months at a stretch,
hey will be helping Ben and a
ourth go after a new world relay
nark. Not to mention points in
ndividual races.

Jack Brugman got another tough
ireak Saturday. Seems to us he
lways has his eye on the finish,
jus just watches each hurdle as it
ornes along. Hope Jack clears 'em
he 30th.
Meier is a good hurdler. Those
imes Saturday were all right for
hat soft track. It was hard enough
o dig in on a flat race, but when
ou jumped on it and then tried
o dig in, that is different.
Azevcdo and Amdahl are go
ing to give S.C. a nice run for
points in the two-mile. We'd
like to see Allan Storms run
ning in top form. If Naylon
doesn't tie up in the Trojan
meet, he is likely to grab off
that third point in the half-mile.
Hall and Harper are going to have
heir hands full in the weight events
/hen Gray, Lyman, Laborde, and
ones start throwing things. A1 Ray
ught to take the javelin too, but
/e wish there was someone here
•ho could give him some compe
tion.

The only thing that el Trojan
asn't spanked us in now is swim
ling. Hope he doesn't import any
uman fish. That water-polo ele
git was one bitter pill to swallow.
00 bad Ted Wiget isn't in school,
'ou can't sink that boy!
Five Indians were in the golf fi
als, but they managed to put each
ther out of the running, and the
>ne S.C. man walked off with the
lverware. Anyhow, we're good as
>ng as we can gang up on them in
le team championships!
Maybe Keith Gledhill IS useful
» the tennis team after all. They
lissed him down south.

That ball team of ours! We have .
ept quiet about as long as we can. |
hey aren't the best club in the I
ague, but they don't win anything |
1 breaks. It is sort of an unwrit- j
n rule that the losing team can't :
■ef about the umps, but now that j
le season's nearly over we'll for- j
.*t about rules.
In Saturday's game, which is
just one example, umpire
Young, behind the plate, called
Vince Philippi out on a third
strike that just cleared the
plate. Even the California root- j
ers didn't agree. In the fatal
ninth, when Stanford was
throwing the game to the four
winds, umpire Borba missed a
play completely. A long fly to
the out-field was caught by
Campbell near the stands. The
runner on first had imagined
that he wouldn't get it, and
was already rounding second, j
On the way back to first, he j
failed to touch second again.
According to the majority of
baseball rules, he was auto- !
matically out, and that would
have retired the side.
In a St. Mary's game, umpire
irle allowed a Gael batter to step •
russ the plate to get in the way
a slow curve. Even student um- ■
res don't pull things as dumb as
at!
