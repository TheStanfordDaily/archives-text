## BEAR NINE BEATS CARDINALS 5-4 IN 1932 SERIES FINAL Bruins Use Four Pitchers In Attempt To Stop Farm Sluggers 
### Bob Wade 
Bunching hits with Bruin errors
in the first, second, third, and fifth
innings, Stanford handed U.C.L.A.'s
varsity baseball team its fourth
straight defeat Friday on the Sunken
Diamond, 10-3.
The Indians scored three runs in
the initial frame on a pair of walks,
hits, and errors. They pushed two
more across in the next inning on
two walks, one hit, and one error,
driving Lou Rose to the showers.
Three more Redskins trotted across
the platter in the third after two
walks, three errors, a double, and a
single had served to finish Pitcher
Koontz. The final runs came in the
fifth on another walk, a single, and
a double.
Bruins Score Two
The Bruins reached Estes for their
first tally in the third inning, on
Lavin's double and Massey's error.
They pushed over their other two
in the sixth on Estes' error, two
walks, and singles by Athey and
Solomon, who had replaced Koontz.
Brubaker Hurls
Captain Brubaker, who went from
third base to the initial sack this
year, showed surprising versatility
by hurling the last four innings and
limiting the Indians to three hits.
Vince Philippi, Stanford's slug
ging second-baseman, ran his con
secutive hit total to seven before he
fiied out to center field his fourth
time at bat. The seven blows all fol
lowd the announcement that he was
lading the league with an average
of .450, so he hasn't lowered his
average lately.
Herm Estes limited the visitors to
five hits, fanned five, and issued only
two passes, to win the game hands
down. Even three Indian errors
failed to give the invaders the game.
Cards Lead in Ninth
In the final California contest of
the year, Stanford went down before
a ninth-inning Bear rally after
seeming to have the battle safely
stowed away, and lost 5-4. The In
dians started the last frame on the
top side of a 4-2 score, but errors
by Trautman and Delmas, singles by
Smith and Vukovitch, and some
classy work by the officials robbed
Anderson of a victory.
Contrary to reports in the city
papers, Stanford outhit the Bears,
but most of the game's miscues were
bunched in the last inning, and the
Indians came out on the short end
of the series.
For Stanford, Captain Rintala,
Delmas, Campbell, and Philippi led
the batting attack with two hits
apiece. Glaister starred for the
Bears with a pair of doubles. An
derson contributed to his own game
with a double, but his teammates
left him stranded on base.

Cards Lead in Ninth
In the final California contest of
the year, Stanford went down before
a ninth-inning Bear rally after
seeming to have the battle safely
stowed away, and lost 5-4. The In
dians started the last frame on the
top side of a 4-2 score, but errors
by Trautman and Delmas, singles by
Smith and Vukovitch, and some
classy work by the officials robbed
Anderson of a victory.
Contrary to reports in the city
papers, Stanford outhit the Bears,
but most of the game's miscues were
bunched in the last inning, and the
Indians came out on the short end
of the series.
For Stanford, Captain Rintala,
Delmas, Campbell, and Philippi led
the batting attack with two hits
apiece. Glaister starred for the
Bears with a pair of doubles. An
derson contributed to his own game
with a double, but his teammates
left him stranded on base.
Bunching hits with Bruin errors
in the first, second, third, and fifth
innings, Stanford handed U.C.L.A.'s
varsity baseball team its fourth
straight defeat Friday on the Sunken
Diamond, 10-3.
The Indians scored three runs in
the initial frame on a pair of walks,
hits, and errors. They pushed two
more across in the next inning on
two walks, one hit, and one error,
driving Lou Rose to the showers.
Three more Redskins trotted across
the platter in the third after two
walks, three errors, a double, and a
single had served to finish Pitcher
Koontz. The final runs came in the
fifth on another walk, a single, and
a double.
Bruins Score Two
The Bruins reached Estes for their
first tally in the third inning, on
Lavin's double and Massey's error.
They pushed over their other two
in the sixth on Estes' error, two
walks, and singles by Athey and
Solomon, who had replaced Koontz.
Brubaker Hurls
Captain Brubaker, who went from
third base to the initial sack this
year, showed surprising versatility
by hurling the last four innings and
limiting the Indians to three hits.
Vince Philippi, Stanford's slug
ging second-baseman, ran his con
secutive hit total to seven before he
fiied out to center field his fourth
time at bat. The seven blows all fol
lowd the announcement that he was
lading the league with an average
of .450, so he hasn't lowered his
average lately.
Herm Estes limited the visitors to
five hits, fanned five, and issued only
two passes, to win the game hands
down. Even three Indian errors
failed to give the invaders the game.
