## Last-Minute Goal Scores Victory For Indians

Smashing out a magnificent 100- i

I play, Pete Lewis turned the tide of I

• in a furious extra-chukker match j
] at San Mateo last Friday afternoon, j
Lewis's goal came after the San i
Mateo Rangers had taken the ball'
! within shooting distance of the ,
; Stanford goal-posts and then missed |
j goal only by inches. Taking the ball !
I practically alone to a little beyond i
! the center of the field, Lewis wal- j
loped the willow pill in one of those
"last chance" shots—and scored.
Stanford's win puts them in the j
finals of the Pacific Coast Novice i
Tournament. Having drawn a bye
for the preliminary matches, the
i Cards need but to nose out the j
i Weatherwax team they are slated j
j to play next Friday, and the crown i
will be theirs.
Since the Stanford poloists are
i not officially connected with the
U. S. Polo Association, the Cards !
; assumed a four-goal handicap. The j
1 Rangers, an eight-goal outfit offi- I
cially, spotted the Cards four goals. [
Even without this added boost to !
( their score, the Redshirts played
I the Rangers on an even basis for I
the first four chukkers. In the sec- J
ond half, with the superiority of the
i San Mateo outfit's mounts showing
j up, the Cards were forced to use '
their handicap in order to down the j
opposition. With ponies of equal j
! ability the match would have been
about a toss-up if played on a fiat '
basis.
