# EICHELBERGER LOSES GOLF CROWN TO TROJAN IN THRILLING 37-HOLE BATTLE
## 
### 
Stanford's contingent of athletes
j to the Minor Sports Carnival may
j not have lived up to expectations,
i but nevertheless it managed to take
I the lion's share of titular glory in
| the various competitions held in Los
1 Angeles over the week-end.
While the Cardinal golfers were
; triumphant in the team champion
j ships, Harry Eichelberger, captain
i of the Stanford golfers, lost to Gail
â€¢ Stockton, of U.S.C., in the finals of
the match play tournament, only
after Stockton had won the 37th
j hole with a birdie four. Eichelberger
, was two up on the morning round,
but the match was squared on the
j 28th. The lead then see-sawed back
j and forth. One down and one hole

to go, Eichelberger came back on
the 36th green to sink a long putt
and even up the match again.
On the 37th, Stockton made the
green in two, while Eichelberger lay
three with six feet between his ball
and the hole. The Trojan's putt for
an eagle three just rimmed the cup
but left him an easy four. Eichel
berger had to sink his next shot to
tie up the match, but again the ball
rimmed the cup, and the title went
to Stockton.
Although the gymnastic team
finished behind U.S.C., California,
and U.C.L.A., the Indian acrobats,
with a total of 31, scored more
points than in any previous gym
tournament.
