# RECORD-BREAKER AND INVALID
## 
### 


Bob Kicsel (left), California's
sprinting bullet, who broke two Big
Meet records Saturday. Les Hables |
of Stanford (right) might have
forced Kiesel to better his 9.G and
21.1 marks if he had been in shape.
Kiesel's record in the century sur- j
passed the !).X hung up by both Ilec
Dyer of Stanford and Barber of
California, and his speedy furlong
broke the old 21.4 Big Meet mark.
