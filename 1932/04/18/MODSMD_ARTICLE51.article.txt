# CUBS TREE INFANT INDIANS IN LITTLE BIG MEET, 71-59
## Three Records Broken Or Tied As Frosh Lose First In 9 Years 
### 
California won her first Little Big
Meet in nine years on the o'd oval
Friday afternoon, 71 '/a to sl>*/2, but
more than one Indian athlete
notched a permanent place for him
self in the Stanford Hall of Fame.
Two Little Big Meets records were
tied and one broken as the Bear
Cubs showed overwhelming strength
in the field events, but were out
scored by Stanford, 44-32, on the
track.
Harold Branting, Bear captain,
leaped 22 feet, IV/4 inches to break
the broad-jump mark set last year
by Trefethen and Johnson of Cali
fornia, and McVay, California's
crack hurdler, after losing the highs
to Jim Savage of Stanford, came
back to nose out Russ Munro in the
low hurdles, and tie "Swede" Leist
ner's mark of 25.6 seconds, which
has stood since 1923. The outstand
ing performances of the meet, how
ever, were turned in by two Stan
ford men, Lloyd Schween and A1
Blackman.
Blackman Beats Branting
Schween hoisted his lithe, slim
body over 6 feet, 2 inches to tie Bob
King's record in the high jump,
while tall, powerful Blackman, cap
tain of the Stanford yearlings, for
got all about his supposed injuries.
Al nearly defeated Branting in a 10-
flat century, came back to beat
Branting in the 220, and then ran
a 49.4 lap in the relay, to overtake
Howard Dalton, the California an
chor man. Blackman's performance
stamps him as the most promising
freshman runner since Ben East
man.
Stanford's only defeat on the
track, besides the low hurdles, came
in the 440, where Ward Vincent, who
was a certain winner for the In
dians, tripped on a water faucet
near the edge of the track, and was
thrown out of the race.

Walt Harris, Phil Morentin, and
Dave Devlin won impressive vic
tories in the 880, mile, and 2-mile,
while George Downing and Bob
Brown copped well-earned third
places in the 880 and mile. Harris'
victory was the easiest of the'whole
meet, while Morentin showed ex
ceptional courage in taking a second
in the two-mile after dropping a
shoe on the sixth lap. Dave Devlin's
time of 10:30.1 was excellent.
Stanford's javelin throwers came
through in surprising fashion. Bill
Beatty won at 183 feet, while Tom
Sales and Johnny Mottram both got
over 170 feet. Aside from Lory
Rothert's fine second in the pole
vault at 12 feet, and Peters' third
in the discus, Stanford was kept
from scoring in the field events.

a 49.4 lap in the relay, to overtake
Howard Dalton, the California an
chor man. Blackman's performance
stamps him as the most promising
freshman runner since Ben East
man.
Stanford's only defeat on the
track, besides the low hurdles, came
in the 440, where Ward Vincent, who
was a certain winner for the In
dians, tripped on a water faucet
near the edge of the track, and was
thrown out of the race.
Cards Sweep Distances
Walt Harris, Phil Morentin, and
Dave Devlin won impressive vic
tories in the 880, mile, and 2-mile,
while George Downing and Bob
Brown copped well-earned third
places in the 880 and mile. Harris'
victory was the easiest of the'whole
meet, while Morentin showed ex
ceptional courage in taking a second
in the two-mile after dropping a
shoe on the sixth lap. Dave Devlin's
time of 10:30.1 was excellent.
Stanford's javelin throwers came
through in surprising fashion. Bill
Beatty won at 183 feet, while Tom
Sales and Johnny Mottram both got
over 170 feet. Aside from Lory
Rothert's fine second in the pole
vault at 12 feet, and Peters' third
in the discus, Stanford was kept
from scoring in the field events.

California won her first Little Big
Meet in nine years on the o'd oval
Friday afternoon, 71 '/a to sl>*/2, but
more than one Indian athlete
notched a permanent place for him
self in the Stanford Hall of Fame.
Two Little Big Meets records were
tied and one broken as the Bear
Cubs showed overwhelming strength
in the field events, but were out
scored by Stanford, 44-32, on the
track.
Harold Branting, Bear captain,
leaped 22 feet, IV/4 inches to break
the broad-jump mark set last year
by Trefethen and Johnson of Cali
fornia, and McVay, California's
crack hurdler, after losing the highs
to Jim Savage of Stanford, came
back to nose out Russ Munro in the
low hurdles, and tie "Swede" Leist
ner's mark of 25.6 seconds, which
has stood since 1923. The outstand
ing performances of the meet, how
ever, were turned in by two Stan
ford men, Lloyd Schween and A1
Blackman.
Blackman Beats Branting
Schween hoisted his lithe, slim
body over 6 feet, 2 inches to tie Bob
King's record in the high jump,
while tall, powerful Blackman, cap
tain of the Stanford yearlings, for
got all about his supposed injuries.
