Friday afternoon, 71 '/a to sl>*/2, but
more than one Indian athlete

Two Little Big Meets records were
tied and one broken as the Bear

scored by Stanford, 44-32, on the
track.
Harold Branting, Bear captain,
leaped 22 feet, IV/4 inches to break
the broad-jump mark set last year
by Trefethen and Johnson of Cali

crack hurdler, after losing the highs
to Jim Savage of Stanford, came
back to nose out Russ Munro in the
low hurdles, and tie "Swede" Leist
ner's mark of 25.6 seconds, which
has stood since 1923. The outstand
ing performances of the meet, how
ever, were turned in by two Stan
ford men, Lloyd Schween and A1
Blackman.

body over 6 feet, 2 inches to tie Bob
King's record in the high jump,
while tall, powerful Blackman, cap
tain of the Stanford yearlings, for
got all about his supposed injuries.

flat century, came back to beat
Branting in the 220, and then ran
a 49.4 lap in the relay, to overtake
Howard Dalton, the California an
chor man. Blackman's performance
