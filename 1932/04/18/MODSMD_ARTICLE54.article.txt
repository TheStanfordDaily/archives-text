# Card Swimmers Cop Pacific Coast Title
## Score 63 Points To Down Best Uclan, Trojan, Bear Tankmen 
### 
Capturing almost double the num
ber of points of his nearest rival,
the Stanford Indian splashed his way
to top swimming honors at the
Minor Sports Carnival at Los An
weles Saturday. The Cardinal total
of 63 points overshadowed U.S.C.'s
32, the Bruins' 12, and California's
10, and cinched the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate championship.
On the other hand, the Trojans
turned around to hand Stanford her
first U.S.C. water polo defeat in the
history of competition between the
two schools. Almost failing to upset
the aquatic edition of the Big Red
Machine, S.C. was barely able to
pull out a 5-4 win against some
pretty strong defense work.
Captain Clapp, Frank Booth, and
Gordy Graves did their best to sup
ply offensive power, but could not
quite push over enough goals to halt
the Trojan march. No doubt the ab
sence of Ted Wiget, who is not en
rolled in school this quarter, had
considerable to do with the effective
teamwork of the seven.
Burke Knapp starred at goal,
strengthening his claim to all-coast
team membership, stopping many a
threatening shot at the Indian cage.
The Trojans took U.C.L.A. by a 13
to 4 count, to bring home the water
polo championship for the first time
in years.
Further information on the de
tails of the swimming meet were
unavailable at a late hour last night.
Most of the team is expected to re
turn to the campus this morning.
Students in Russia who are in
sympathy with the government are
paid to attend universities.
