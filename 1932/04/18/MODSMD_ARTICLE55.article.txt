# INDIAN NET TEAM DOWNED IN TITLE CONFERENCE TILTS
## Gledhill's Absence Fatal AS Trojans Win, 7-2; And Bruins By 9-0 
### 
j Stanford's hopes for a conferenco
i championship in tennis were smoth
! ered when the Indians bowed to
| U.S.C. 7 to 2 Friday and U.C.L.A.
j 9 to 0, Saturday in Los Angeles.
The Indians, playing without the
j services of Keith Gledhill, captain,
I and Jack Cosgrove, No. 3 man, were
I no match for the strong teams of the
i Trojans and Bruins. They were able
jto win only one single and one
j doubles match from Southern Cali
fornia, and were unable to cop a
| single win from the championship
j headed Bruins.
Although Stanford had previously
! defeated both teams on the Stanford
| courts, the loss of two of their stellar
1 players was too much of a handicap
| in the return matches, inasmuch as
j most of the Indian players had to
| move up two notches in the rank
ing. Acting Captain Joe Coughlin
suffered from a sore arm in Satur
! day's matches and was defeated in
| singles for the first time this year,
i Other Stanford players who played
I well in spite of the double defeat
i were: Chuck Weesner, who lost a
heart-breaker to Billy Doeg of the
Bruins; John Gordon, who has
played only in the last three meets;
and the Charles Otis - Dan Ellis
doubles team,
