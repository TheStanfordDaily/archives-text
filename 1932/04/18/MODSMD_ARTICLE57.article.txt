Secretary Ogden L. Mills of the treasury opened the senate hear
ings on tax legislation and urged that more than $170,000,000 be deleted
from the house tax bill. He is shown here (right), apparently in a jovial
mood, as he discussed his position with Senator Reed Smoot, chairman
of the senate finance committee.
