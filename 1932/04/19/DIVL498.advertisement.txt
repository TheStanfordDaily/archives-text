WORLD CRUISE
i
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
TO CO TO SEA
On a trip of about 10 months on one of the largest sailing ships
afloat. You pay about what it would cost you to stay home
for the same length of time. Here's how:
A carefully picked group of men from various parts of the j
country will serve as the crew under experienced officers. You '
have a chance to make this crew, if you act quickly.
The crew will be big enough to avoid making drudgery of j
work aboard ship. Every man will stand all the regular sea
watches in turn â€”he will learn the sea and seamanship. No i
women nor children. No cargo.
Nearly 30,000 miles of adventurous sailing to the unfre- |
quented waters of the world with a keen crowd.
Starts early September. Includes South Seas, New Zealand, !
Australia, southern Indian Ocean and the south and north I
Atlantic.
