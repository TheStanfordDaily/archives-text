warming aboard the liner Europa 1
> she lay at her Brooklyn pier, |
score of Brooklyn detectives
■arched every part of the vessel
i an attempt to locate the missing ,
indbergh baby. The search was
•ompted by a hurried communica- i
on from Col. H. Norman Schwarz- i
>p, head of the New Jersey state |

rmed the child was on the liner. 1
Passengers were quizzed, luggage ,

ldnaping Nothing
ut Business—LaPiere
"Any fool can steal a baby."
That is what Richard T. LaPiere, ]
sistant professor of sociology, I
inks of so-called "psychoses" re- j
onsible for the kidnaping of the
ndbergh baby.
"Kidnaping," continued LaPiere,
> nothing but a business proposi- ;
>n. The present case is no different !
an dozens of similar abductions in
e past. It has attracted so much
tent ion simply because of the fame !
the child's parents that many have
tempted to discover some hideous j
normality behind the crime.
"This particular form of crime," {
explained, "is no different funda- ;
intally from stealing a rare old !
inting, for instance. It is especially j
ective because the object of the !
Dft is irreplaceable. Added to this !
the promise of immunity at the !
nds of the law to the kidnapers." !
Concluding, LaPiere said. "The !
me indicates no new breakdown j
the nation's morality. After all, |
sis only one lone case of law- j
2aking. Newspapers have given so
ich space to the kidnaping—simply i
cause it is the Lindbergh baby— I
at we imagine the case to be 1
»tly more significant from the soci- j
igical viewpoint than it really is. J
'As to just why the baby hasn't ;
sn returned I can only venture i
0 guesses. Either the kidnapers I
1 afraid to bring the baby out of !
hiding place, or else they are j
empting to extort additional ran- [
n from Colonel Lindbergh. On
; face of it, there seems to be no '
icr deuction possible."
