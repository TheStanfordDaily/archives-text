# Huskie Crew Hopeful For Annual P'kipsie Regatta
## 
### 
SEATTLE. April 18. (/P)â€”Wash- j
ington's conquering freshman crew ;
ol' 1931 willl carry the hopes of the i
Huskies in the annual intercolle
giate regatta at Poughkeepsie, New i
York, and the all-important Olym
pic trials this summer.
Five and possibly six of the year- i
ling oarsmen who last year cap- !
tured the national freshman cham- |
pionship on the Hudson river, will !
hold seats in the varsity 8-oared 1
shell this season.
The crushing defeat by California j
has not disheartened the crew. With
out proper protection and under .
miserable weather conditions they 1
did well to keep afloat, Coach A1
Ulbrickson believes, with their boat, j
half full of water.
