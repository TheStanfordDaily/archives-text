# Five Professors Score Hamill's Book On Hoover
## 
### Bob Place 
Characterizing "The Strange Ca
reer of Mr. Hoover: Under Two
?lags," by John Hamill as a vicious
md unwarranted attack on a de
fenseless man, live Stanford pro
essors from the social science de
jartment recently condemned the
jook and like attacks in the interest
>f fair play. They declared that the
X)ok was written for a gullible
Vmerican-Weekly public, solely for
he purpose of making money, and
ontains a mass of innuendo, lies, and
nisinterpretation of documents.
Disreputable Publisher
Originally employed by J. J.
D'Brien to write an "exposing"
>iography of Hoover, Hamill is said
o have crossed his employer and had
he book published by Samuel Roth,
iliari William Faro, a nondescript
mblisher who has served prison
entences for printing obscene books.
J'Brien sued Hamill but lost the suit,
md so immediately commissioned
mother yellow journalist to write

i the biography. However, Hamill's !
book was (he first to reach the book
stands, and consequently has ac- j
j quired the majority of the "velvet" j
to be gained though many subse
quent attacks have been printed.
Hoover is in a difficult position
regarding these attacks, as the dig- :
! nity of the presidency forbids his
sueing the authors for libel. The
: position is not a new one for a presi
dent. Roosevelt sued for one penny j
j after bis term in office and won.
, Cleveland was accused of having il
| legitimate children, and other prcsi
[ dents have been subjected to the
' same humiliating treatment. If
j Hoover sues, people will say "where '
there's smoke, there's fire," and if 1
; he ignores the attacks, it will seem
j that he is afraid to answer them.
Accusations Ridiculous. I
As for the book itself—it is so
vicious, it is funny. The author's
plan ol attack is to accuse Hoover
of everything but sex crimes, and as
refutation of each accusation is dif
i ficult, some are bound to be accepted
as the truth. This verbal knifing in
the back declares that: Hoover is
really an Englishman at heart; he is
not a geologist or engineer; he has
never donated as much as five dol
lars to charity; he uses filthy lan
guage and occasionally drinks; he
ruthlessly killed off miners in Au
stralia, declaring that mining timber
was more valuable than lives; he
has cheated widows and orphans of
their life savings by manipulation of
mine stocks; he enslaved Chinese
i coolies, taking them to Africa to
work; he cheated the Chinese gov
i ernment of its mines; his fortune is
due to illegal gain in China, oil
scandals, land swindles, fake mines,
and the Belgium Relief Fund; he is
responsible for the entrance of the
[ United States in the World War, and
for the execution of Edith Cavell,
English nurse. Besides being poorly
written and printed, the book will
Ibe seen by the thinking man as
ridiculous and contemptible.

Bailey, and Fisher of the history de
partment comment on the book.

As for the book itself—it is so
vicious, it is funny. The author's
plan ol attack is to accuse Hoover
of everything but sex crimes, and as
refutation of each accusation is dif
i ficult, some are bound to be accepted
as the truth. This verbal knifing in
the back declares that: Hoover is
really an Englishman at heart; he is
not a geologist or engineer; he has
never donated as much as five dol
lars to charity; he uses filthy lan
guage and occasionally drinks; he
ruthlessly killed off miners in Au
stralia, declaring that mining timber
was more valuable than lives; he
has cheated widows and orphans of
their life savings by manipulation of
mine stocks; he enslaved Chinese
i coolies, taking them to Africa to
work; he cheated the Chinese gov
i ernment of its mines; his fortune is
due to illegal gain in China, oil
scandals, land swindles, fake mines,
and the Belgium Relief Fund; he is
responsible for the entrance of the
[ United States in the World War, and
for the execution of Edith Cavell,
English nurse. Besides being poorly
written and printed, the book will
Ibe seen by the thinking man as
ridiculous and contemptible.
