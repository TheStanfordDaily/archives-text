# Five Professors Score Hamill's Book On Hoover
## 
### Bob Place 
Characterizing "The Strange Ca
reer of Mr. Hoover: Under Two
?lags," by John Hamill as a vicious
md unwarranted attack on a de
fenseless man, live Stanford pro
essors from the social science de
jartment recently condemned the
jook and like attacks in the interest
>f fair play. They declared that the
X)ok was written for a gullible
Vmerican-Weekly public, solely for
he purpose of making money, and
ontains a mass of innuendo, lies, and
nisinterpretation of documents.
Disreputable Publisher
Originally employed by J. J.
D'Brien to write an "exposing"
>iography of Hoover, Hamill is said
o have crossed his employer and had
he book published by Samuel Roth,
iliari William Faro, a nondescript
mblisher who has served prison
entences for printing obscene books.
J'Brien sued Hamill but lost the suit,
md so immediately commissioned
mother yellow journalist to write

i the biography. However, Hamill's !
book was (he first to reach the book
stands, and consequently has ac- j
j quired the majority of the "velvet" j
to be gained though many subse
quent attacks have been printed.
Hoover is in a difficult position
regarding these attacks, as the dig- :
! nity of the presidency forbids his
sueing the authors for libel. The
: position is not a new one for a presi
dent. Roosevelt sued for one penny j
j after bis term in office and won.
, Cleveland was accused of having il
| legitimate children, and other prcsi
[ dents have been subjected to the
' same humiliating treatment. If
j Hoover sues, people will say "where '
there's smoke, there's fire," and if 1
; he ignores the attacks, it will seem
j that he is afraid to answer them.
Accusations Ridiculous. I
As for the book itself—it is so
vicious, it is funny. The author's
plan ol attack is to accuse Hoover
