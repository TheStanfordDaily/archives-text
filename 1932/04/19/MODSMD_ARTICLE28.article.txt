# BOOK-WEARY CARDS LURED TO BIG TENT BY LIONS, CLOWNS
## 
### 
Just how much appeal books and
| lectures have in the face of lions,
I tigers, clowns, acrobats, peanuts,
popcorn, t and horses, horses, horses!
J was demonstrated when the A1 G.
j Barnes special train puffed into the
! Southern Pacific station in Paly last
j night.
A checkup of the much-exploited
; Stanford sophistication will be made
j when a count of students attending
I this afternoon's performance of the
big show is taken.
Eighteen countries will be repre
j sented by the 200 performers, along
i with the inevitable Belmost family
j of riders, and 40 dancing horses and
| 40 dancing girls. "The Pageant of
j Gold" will not be a revival of the
j '49 episode, it was revealed by the
i management.
"Kings and queens of the circus
j don't mind life on the road nowa
| days," the manager stated. "An or
! ganization of more than 1,000 people
j traveling on three extra-doublc
| length trains, five rings, and two
! stages is a far cry from the little
j wagon show that bumped its way
j over the rough country roads scv
j oral decades ago."
