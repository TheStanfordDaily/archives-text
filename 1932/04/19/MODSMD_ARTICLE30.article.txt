# WORKOUTS ARE SCHEDULED AS RUNNERS 'REST'
## Giberson Makes Fair Time Of 38.7 In 352-Yard Grinding Sprint PRACTICE MEET FRIDAY Distance Men Put Through Post-Meet Paces 
### 
Big Chief Bill Ellington of the
Stanford Indians started the post
| Big-Meet week of track training off
i in nice, easy fashion yesterday.
All he did was to ask the two
milers to run a mere 16 laps, the
[ milers to tote their carcasses about
for two miles, and the half-milers
to run 1320 yards. The rest of the
team also engaged in light workouts.
Ben Eastman and Ralph Gibcrson
: were the only men who were timed,
| the Blazer recording 1:20 for his 660
and hard-working Gibey tearing
; around a 352 in 38.7.
Hard Sprint
Three hundred and fifty-two yards
is supposed to be the longest dis
tance a man can sprint at full speed,
and it is decidcdly wearing on the
victim's lungs, legs, and intestinal
'fortitude. Giberson's time is fair, and
Les Hables, who ran with the short,
' stocky dash-man, finished strong to
; show he is already getting back into
i shape.
; Eastman, Lombardi, Nash, Murphy,
; and Guittard all started the 660, and
Eastman finished it. As usual Ben,
without meaning to be at all high-
I hat, had too much class for his com
| petitors.
Two of Stanford's straight "A" dis
! tance men ran four miles and a third
contented himself with two. Amdahl
I and Azevedo spent most of the aftcr
! noon learning how easy their favor
| ite distance—the two-mile—really
! is, and Bob Atkinson began to ap
; predate the paucity of yards in a
| mile by running two of them.
Friday Practice Meet
With no official competition on
! tap for Saturday, Ellington will hold
! a practice meet Friday just 1o keep
| the boys in shape. On Sunday, many
j of the Card stars will enter the Gae
| lie Association open meet at Kezar
Stadium.

The Indians will be just plain
- track men in that meet, as they will
|be competing unattached. Runners,
i jumpers, and weightmen from the
i Olympic Club, California, and S.F.U.
and others will furnish competition.
