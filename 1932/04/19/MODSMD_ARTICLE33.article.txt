The fate of (he Conceit Scries for next year will he de
cided tonight <il the meeting of Ihe Executive Committee
when the student manager of the series presents the case to
that hodv.

A poll taken til the John Charles Thomas concert
showed that fill people were in favor of maintaining the
Concert Series, 28(5 students responding in the affirmative,
7f> facility memhers and IK.'5 off-campus peo])le. The poll
tÂ« mot he regarded as complete as many are being sent in
by mail and also many failed to till in the slips at all. There
were no votes favoring the abolition of the Series.
Ninety-one made applications for tickets for next year's
series at the same time, 27 of these being made by stu
dents, 3.') by the faculty and .'sl by off-campus residents. As
practically all the applications were for two or more tickets,
these represent bids for approximately 250 tickets. This
large advance sale is all the more significant considering
that it is not yet known if the concerts are to be continued,
let alone who any of the artists will be.
The Concert Series is the only cultural advantage of
fered at Stanford and also this University will be the only
one of its size on the Coast that does not have at least one
or more such entertainments, if the Series is not main
tained.
There still remains the financial hurdle to clear. True
enough, the Series will lose quite heavily this year, but this
period is far from normal and it would be unjust to judge
the Series on this year's results. Also the Series was poorly
handled and next year should see a decided improvement.
If the Concert Series manager can present a favorable
budget for next year without over-estimating the income,
the concerts should ccrtainlv be continued.
