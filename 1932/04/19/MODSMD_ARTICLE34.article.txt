# SAYING SAN FRANCISCO'S SKYLINE
## 
### 
All lovers of San Francisco's beauty will rejoice at the
news that a $200,000 bequest for a memorial to pioneer
volunteer lircmen is to be used in building a graceful tower
to surmount Telegraph Hill, the* historic tree-covered pro
montory which overlooks the bay waterfront.
If it may be judged by the architect's drawing, the tower
will be an impressive addition to the skyline, but that is
not Ihe greatest of its merits. Deliverance from the horrible,
menace of a gigantic statue to the Forty-Xiners, proposed
by some overly enthusiastic native sons for erection on that
site, is the real reason for thanking heaven that the tower
plan has been adopted.
While the Colossus of Rhodes may have been a master
piece of art, and while the Statue of Liberty in its isolated
location is an asset to New York harbor, il requires little
aesthetic taste to realize that Telegraph Hill is scarcely an
appropriate site for a similar statue.
Kven . iesigned by a sculptor equal in ability to the
ancient Creek masters, such a memorial would strike an
obviously false note when superimposed upon the city's
serrated mass of tall buildings. A simple stone, tower will
not detract from the general view, whatever the artistic
worth of ils design; a huge statue could be nothing but a
misplaced curiosity.
