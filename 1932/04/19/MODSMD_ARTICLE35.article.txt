"kidnaping" episode on the t'niversitv of Washington
campus has exposed that college and ils home town, Seat

all, il was a joke on themselves that thev failed to see.
Rob Roake, a bold ami ambitious student promoter on
the committee of the Cadet Rail framed the whole thing
simply for Ihe publicity that would result. Though he still
vows that il was a genuine kidnaping, all of Seattle is pretty
well convinced that il has been hoaxed.
Last Wednesday Ihe university was roused to a pitch
rivaling Ihe fever that surrounds the Lindbergh baby case.
Police were madly searching, uneasy mothers were asking
protection for their offspring for litis new kidnap menace,
and fellow students were becoming uneasy. Then Rob

tale of abduction.
Now everyone is angry. The dean of men has expressed
his indignation in a public statement. And the city police
are not exactly trying to hide their feeling on the mailer.
