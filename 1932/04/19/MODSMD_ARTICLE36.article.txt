# BULL SESSION
## THE
						AGE OF PRAISE 
### 
In a speech which ended with the
words, "So good-by and God Bless
you"—W. R. Hearst poured upon j
the air the other evening a (>OO- j
word blurb on the greatness of!
radio. The occasion was the tenth !
anniversary of the N.B.C. station in j
Los Angeles. The station was glad to j
get the free Hearst publicity that j
would result from a speech by j
Hearst! Hearst was happy to speak j
for a station that often "invites" him j
to speak on political questions, j
Everybody was served.
The address enumerated all the
wonderful advantages of radio—we
learn in part that "It spreads educa
tion, widens our experience, in
creases our knowledge, refines our j
tastes, enlarges our vision," and on'
and on—the expected list of bene- '
fits. Yet while we must admit that j
this much abused planet is probably i
better off with the radio, one cannot '
help but feel that this invention is I
not yielding the maximum in any- :
thing but the simplest type of time- j
passing amusement.
I
Because the appeal of each radiq.
station is "universal"; because every I
station has that mythical audience
of "20 million"'in mind, we get the i
type of programs we do. And as far .
as the two chains go, their appeal is '
always to the greatest number pos- ;
sible. In short, every radio station !
is an auditory "Saturday Evening
Post"—or perhaps, a "Post" plus j
"Liberty. ' Now Franklin's gargan- j
tuan child is passable in its way— '
but imagine a world where every j
magazine was a "Post"—no "New j
Yorkers," no "Vanity Fairs," no 1

"Nations," no ''Forums,'' no ''Atlan
tic's," and the rest.
But that is just ihe situation in
! the radio world. The appeal is de- j
' cidedly the same as that of Ihe
j "Post" or of "Liberty." And excepl
I for rare exceptions, the individual
I who expects to have his aesthetic or
| intellectual sensibilities nourished
1 by radio's voice is doomed to dis
| appointment. Each radio station
| must depend for the greatest body of
j its listeners in the immediate corn
! niunity—despite the radio bugs who
| are always picking up distant points.
The minority that reads the maga
| zines listed above is very small nu
merically in each community. 1
Therefore they can be ignored. The
I lowest common denominator of in-''
j telligence and taste becomes the
I standard. There are three possible
I solutions—one impossible, another
I possible, and a third English. It
jis impossible to conceive of the
i radio stations casting commercial
i ism and mob appeal to the winds
j arid becoming cultural for the meek
1 minority.
The English system of non-com
i mercial broadcasting supported by
1 a governmental tax on aH receivers !
j could be established with great
benefits. The likely solution in this
I country would be for the radio com
j panics to grant the government a'
l certain percentage of their time— .
which could be used for the uplift 1
lof the people and all that sort of
j thing. That the present system of
| unrestrained profitable capitaliza
! lion of this potentially valuable
! agency will long endure is not
1 likely. —Abe Mellinkoff
