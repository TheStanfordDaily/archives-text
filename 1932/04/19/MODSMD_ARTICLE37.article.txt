THE GREEKS HAD A WORD FOR
THEM—At the New Stanford.
Eureka! The Greeks had a word
ior it and so will you, once you've
seen this picture. Ina Claire, Joan
Blondell, and Madge Evans cut
some gay capers and leave you in :
the world's most supercilious mood, i
This feminine trio sticks together,
wangles its way through many a
susceptible male's pocketbook, and
settles the weighty problems of the ;
world by taking ''just one more little •
'drinkie. However, all does not go \
smoothly, they constantly wrangle j
among themselves, thereby manag- i
ing to rescue one another from com
mitting the fatal step of matrimony. '
Despite the fact that the story \
ends with a high point thermometer ;
indicating Inn Claire's heart-health, j
any optimist could interpret the'
episode as just another strange in- j
terlude and remain convinced that
Schatze, Polaire, and Jeanne will
always remain a gold-digging trio—
well-kept, well-groomed, and well
entertained. —E.E.H.
SURF—By Knut Anderson. The [
Century Co. 1931.
Knut Anderson tells with won- j
derful simplicity and beauty the I
tale of the love of a rough Danish j
seaman and a cultured girl. Pride!
and passion nearly wreck their j
marriage, but the suffering and the |
grief caused by long separation j
brings them together again for a i
maintained voyage.
Like Jack London, Anderson is
himself a nomad with the swish of j
the wild salt spray in his blood. His I
tales are not only concerned with !
man's combat with the elements, but j
also with his internal struggles. His j
characterization is wonderfully ]
given, and one lives and struggles j
with Ture.

This finely drawn characterization
marks what is best in Scandinavian
literature of all times. Today it
| might mark the best of any litera
ture, as well. —A.L.A.
THE FIRST LADY BRENDON—At
the Palo Alto Book Shop.
Demonstrating a strange phenome
non of science, Robert Hichens'
: latest novel, "The First Lady Bren
| don," tells of the fantastic mental
■ resemblance between a child and
; his mother's former husband. This
i theory, sometimes called telegony,
jis still unproven and has been of
; recent years the source of much iri
| vestigation by scientists.
Brutish characteristics of an Eng
! lish lord, observed years later in
j the son ol his former wife, form the
j basis of the story. Lady Ivy Bren
| don, having finally procured a di
| vorce from her unfaithful husband,
marries a promising young doctor,
Mervyn Cleeve. Guy, their child,
although he physically resembles his
parents, develops into an unlovely
character, much like Lord Brendon.
i Early, Guy Cleeve violates the
, English code of good sportsmanship.
| The amazed indignation at Guy, the
I tennis player, who doubts the lines
man and causes a brawl at Wimble
ton, will appeal to any lover of fair
play, just as the weak, atavistic ac
tions of the youth will make one's
blood boil.
Neurotic is the character of Lady
j Brendon, who is presented as being
j extremely sensitive to psychic in
; fiuences.
"The First Lady Brendon" is
! recommended to anyone wanting
! some slightly dull reading to lull
j him to sleep. But enjoyment and
J excitement are hard to find in the
500 pages of this latest Hichens
I book. --J.M.H.

i theory, sometimes called telegony,
jis still unproven and has been of
; recent years the source of much iri
| vestigation by scientists.
Brutish characteristics of an Eng
! lish lord, observed years later in
j the son ol his former wife, form the
j basis of the story. Lady Ivy Bren
| don, having finally procured a di
| vorce from her unfaithful husband,
marries a promising young doctor,
Mervyn Cleeve. Guy, their child,
although he physically resembles his
parents, develops into an unlovely
character, much like Lord Brendon.
i Early, Guy Cleeve violates the
, English code of good sportsmanship.
| The amazed indignation at Guy, the
I tennis player, who doubts the lines
man and causes a brawl at Wimble
ton, will appeal to any lover of fair
play, just as the weak, atavistic ac
tions of the youth will make one's
blood boil.
Neurotic is the character of Lady
j Brendon, who is presented as being
j extremely sensitive to psychic in
; fiuences.
"The First Lady Brendon" is
! recommended to anyone wanting
! some slightly dull reading to lull
j him to sleep. But enjoyment and
J excitement are hard to find in the
500 pages of this latest Hichens
I book. --J.M.H.
THE GREEKS HAD A WORD FOR
THEM—At the New Stanford.
Eureka! The Greeks had a word
ior it and so will you, once you've
seen this picture. Ina Claire, Joan
Blondell, and Madge Evans cut
some gay capers and leave you in :
the world's most supercilious mood, i
This feminine trio sticks together,
wangles its way through many a
susceptible male's pocketbook, and
settles the weighty problems of the ;
world by taking ''just one more little •
'drinkie. However, all does not go \
smoothly, they constantly wrangle j
among themselves, thereby manag- i
ing to rescue one another from com
mitting the fatal step of matrimony. '
Despite the fact that the story \
ends with a high point thermometer ;
indicating Inn Claire's heart-health, j
any optimist could interpret the'
episode as just another strange in- j
terlude and remain convinced that
Schatze, Polaire, and Jeanne will
always remain a gold-digging trio—
well-kept, well-groomed, and well
entertained. —E.E.H.
SURF—By Knut Anderson. The [
Century Co. 1931.
Knut Anderson tells with won- j
derful simplicity and beauty the I
tale of the love of a rough Danish j
seaman and a cultured girl. Pride!
and passion nearly wreck their j
marriage, but the suffering and the |
grief caused by long separation j
brings them together again for a i
maintained voyage.
Like Jack London, Anderson is
himself a nomad with the swish of j
the wild salt spray in his blood. His I
tales are not only concerned with !
man's combat with the elements, but j
also with his internal struggles. His j
characterization is wonderfully ]
given, and one lives and struggles j
with Ture.

This finely drawn characterization
marks what is best in Scandinavian
literature of all times. Today it
| might mark the best of any litera
ture, as well. —A.L.A.
