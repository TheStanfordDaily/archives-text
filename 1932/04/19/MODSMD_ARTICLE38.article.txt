# RADIO TRANSMITTER BUILT BY STUDENTS PROVES SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
Completion of the high power
radio transmitter built by students
| in the School of Engineering v/as
| achieved Saturday when Jim Sharp
! installed the aerial. Sunday morning j
| he exchanged messages with a sta- »
j tion in Des Moines, lowa.
Yesterday morning Sharp talked ;
I with stations at Binghamton, Now '
j York, and Uniontown, Pennsylvania, i
! The latter station said Stanford's |
signal was good and loud, an en-!
j couraging report.
This transmitter, which embodies !
the latest developments in ihe field
: of radio transmission, is capable of i
| receiving and sending to stations all
I over the world. A similar one built i
! by Paul Byrne, who received his
Engineer's degree last quarter, has

: contacted London, Paris, North
Africa, Hawaii, Australia, New Zea
land, Siberia; and several South
American countries.
j A valuable feature of the instru
ment is a small .03-inch piece of
quartz which controls the frequency
of the transmitter. This will make
it possible to install a modulator
j later, when the transmitter can be
; used with voice also, like a tele
| phone.
[ The transmitter will be used by
the Radio Club. A meeting will be
held soon to arrange for its use.
The Dead Sea has no outlet and
does not contain animal life. Birds
and animals avoid the region.
