# Steward Refuses Encina's Bottles
## 
### 
Two hundred Encina Commons
water bottles were cheated of an
extended voyage on the high seas
last week, when their shape was
pronounced unsatisfactory by the
stewart of a steamer in San Fran
cisco.
It all came about when a large
hotel supply firm telegraphed to the
campus and asked to purchase some
of Encina's bottles. Delighted to find
a buyer for the bottles, which had
been a bother to handle and almost
impossible to clean, officials here
ordered them packed in excelsior,
rushed to the dock in San Francisco.
They arrived in good condition.
The steward took one look and de
cided that they did not fulfill his
conception of what a satisfactory
water bottle should be. Now they're
in storage in San Francisco.
