OLD MAN Dope smiled genially
as we dropped in on him last night.
"Didn't see you at the track meet
Saturday," he said, as he poured
out some of that excellent old tea
of his. "I trust you didn't miss it."
"Doggone," we replied, "the radio
had to suffice. Nothing worth while
like Dink has, or a real smashup
like Dick Rodda's—just a touch of
laryngitis—but the doc said 'no
track meet.'"
"Here, this will fix you up." There
was a pause and then an evil glint
came into his eye. "I read your pre
dictions on the meet Friday, but I
didn't see any 98 points or better
on the scoreboard after the Berkeley
festivities were over."
"But who could look for all those
really great 'come through' per
formances by those heretofore rather
mangy Bears?" we inquired. "You
took rather a beating yourself, didn't
you?"
"HAVE SOME more tea? No?
Then help yourself to a smoke
while I dig up my pipe."
Having found it, (he old gen
tleman settled himself hack in
his easy chair, and the air was
blue with smoke before he spoke
again. "Yes, I took a beating all
right," he conceded finally, "hut
let me tell you something I
WON'T he wrong on unless
something happens between now
and April 30.
"In less than two weeks Stan
ford's track men are going to
Los Angeles for their little an
nual set-to with those Trojan
fellows. And unless a great deal
is accomplished on the Farm
between now and then, it's going
to he a dreary afternoon for the
Cardinal.
"OF COURSE." the venerable
dopester continued, "I realize that
those Indian lads probably didn't
take California too seriously, and
they found Christie's Bears in an
ugly mood. Naturally, they will have
a lot more respect for U.S.C., espe
cially after what happened Satur
day.
"With both Hables boys under the
weather and Bill Miller and Dave
Packard not competing, the squad
wasn't al its greatest potential
strength. But at that, Stanford is
going to need a lot more than mere
respect and a few more men to stop
Cromwell's bunch.
''Wykoff showed that he will be
ready for activity by that time by
winning both sprints just about as
he pleased in the Olympic Club
meet at Los Angeles Saturday. Gra
ber did 13 feet, eight inches in the
pole vault, ctnd Barber got out to
24 feet, seven inches in the broad
jump, which is pretty fair for a
couple of cripples.
"Meanwhile Stanford was falling
below expectations in many events
al Berkeley. All in all, things don't
look too bright for Dink's outfit
right now."
"CHEERFUL PERSON, aren't
you?" we put in.
"You mustn't get me wrong,"
the old hoy replied hurriedly.
"I don't mean to say Stanford
hasn't a chance. But 1 am mak
ing it strong that there's a lot
of work ahead, and that a little
hit of that 'come through' spirit
shown by California wouldn't do
any harm."
"Well, it looks like you're
right," we said, rising to leave.
"Drop in again before the
meet." the old gentleman re
marked at the door. "There will
still he some of that tea around
—and maybe I can give you an
encouraging prediction."
Which is exactly what we in
tend to do. —L.M.C.

ber did 13 feet, eight inches in the
pole vault, ctnd Barber got out to
24 feet, seven inches in the broad
jump, which is pretty fair for a
couple of cripples.

below expectations in many events
al Berkeley. All in all, things don't
look too bright for Dink's outfit
right now."
"CHEERFUL PERSON, aren't
you?" we put in.
"You mustn't get me wrong,"
the old hoy replied hurriedly.
"I don't mean to say Stanford
hasn't a chance. But 1 am mak
ing it strong that there's a lot
of work ahead, and that a little
hit of that 'come through' spirit
shown by California wouldn't do
any harm."
"Well, it looks like you're
right," we said, rising to leave.
"Drop in again before the
meet." the old gentleman re
marked at the door. "There will
still he some of that tea around
—and maybe I can give you an
encouraging prediction."

tend to do. —L.M.C.
OLD MAN Dope smiled genially
as we dropped in on him last night.
"Didn't see you at the track meet
Saturday," he said, as he poured
out some of that excellent old tea
of his. "I trust you didn't miss it."
"Doggone," we replied, "the radio
had to suffice. Nothing worth while
like Dink has, or a real smashup
like Dick Rodda's—just a touch of
laryngitis—but the doc said 'no
track meet.'"
"Here, this will fix you up." There
was a pause and then an evil glint
came into his eye. "I read your pre
dictions on the meet Friday, but I
didn't see any 98 points or better
on the scoreboard after the Berkeley
festivities were over."
"But who could look for all those
really great 'come through' per
formances by those heretofore rather
mangy Bears?" we inquired. "You
took rather a beating yourself, didn't
you?"
"HAVE SOME more tea? No?
Then help yourself to a smoke
while I dig up my pipe."
Having found it, (he old gen
tleman settled himself hack in
his easy chair, and the air was
blue with smoke before he spoke
again. "Yes, I took a beating all
right," he conceded finally, "hut
let me tell you something I
WON'T he wrong on unless
something happens between now
and April 30.
"In less than two weeks Stan
ford's track men are going to
Los Angeles for their little an
nual set-to with those Trojan
fellows. And unless a great deal
is accomplished on the Farm
between now and then, it's going
to he a dreary afternoon for the
Cardinal.
"OF COURSE." the venerable
dopester continued, "I realize that
those Indian lads probably didn't
take California too seriously, and
they found Christie's Bears in an
ugly mood. Naturally, they will have
a lot more respect for U.S.C., espe
cially after what happened Satur
day.
"With both Hables boys under the
weather and Bill Miller and Dave
Packard not competing, the squad
wasn't al its greatest potential

going to need a lot more than mere
respect and a few more men to stop
Cromwell's bunch.
