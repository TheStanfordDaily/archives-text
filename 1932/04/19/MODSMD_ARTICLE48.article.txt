# Farm Fencers Take Championship In L.A. Bouts
## SOPHOMORE LEADS CARD SWORDSMEN TO COAST VICTORY Snyder Takes Novice Foils Title As Unofficial Stanford Entry 
### 
Led by Alfred Snyder, sophomore
foilsman, Stanford's fencers won the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate fencing
championship and placed three men
in the A.F.L.A. individual finals
during their busy week-end in Los
Angeles.
Rapid of wrist and eye, short
! Snyder copped the novice foil cham
! pionship without losing a bout. Al,
I who made the trip on his own, as
i he was not a regular member of the
! Cardinal squad, also made the rest
|of the coast novices wish he had
I stayed at home. His victory, in ad
| dition to being made in the most
i decisive fashion of any in the entire
meet, is also the first individual title
won by a Stanford man since Elwyn
Bugge, present fencing coach,
brought the same title back to the
Farm in 1923.
Captain Shines
Competing in every meet, Captain
Len Pockman was largely responsi
ble for the Indian triumph ever
U.C., U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. in ihe
minor sports tournament. The Card
teams captured first in both the foil
and epee meets and got second in
the saber tourney for their win.
Stanford won the foil meet by de
feating California five bouts to one,
U.C.L.A. by the same score, and
the Trojans five to four. John Fer
guson came through to win the de
ciding bout from U.S.C. lor the In
dian victory. Len Pockman and Dick
Criley were the other foilsmen.
U.C. and U.S.C. both fell five
bouts to three in the epee meet,
but the Uclans, whose team consists
entirely of epee men, defeated the
two Pockmans and Pearman five to
nothing. The saber scores were
Stanford 5, California 0, and U.S.C.
5. Stanford 4. The Pockman brethren
and Jim Reed fenced saber.
A Pair for Pearman
Fred Pearman, whose work with
the epee promises much, won two
cups by getting second in the
A.F.L.A. novice epee and saber
tourneys. Fred was the only Stan
ford man and one of the few among
the coast's best to place in two
meets.
After fencing like a javelin
thrower with a broken arm in his
first matches, Dick Criley suddenly
hit his top form in the open foils
and finished third. Criley beat the
L.A.A.C. stars, DeJong and Faulk
ner, and it was because of his tardy
upsets that Ted Lorber of the Olym
pic Club was able to win this title.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club
team, containing three men of Olym
pic Games calibi'e, was too much
for Stanford in the A.F.L.A. team
meets. Duris DeJong, a member of
the Dutch Olympic team in 1928 and
a sure member this year, Ralph
Faulkner, who qualified for the
American team by winning the open
saber tourney, and a Club veteran
named Cathcart took all three titles
from Stanford, the Northern Cali
fornia champions.
The score in both the foil and
saber meets was five bouts to two.
The epee meet ended three matches
for each team, but the L.A.A.C. won
the fence-off. Captain Pockman. the
Stanford man with a chance to
make the 01ymj)ic team, lost his
opportunity when Faulkner and De-
Jong got first and second in the open
saber championship.
Jack Coombs has started his
fourth season as baseball coach
at Duke University.
