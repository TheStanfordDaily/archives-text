# Massie Story Fails To Waver Under Grillings
## 
### 
HONOLULU, April 18. (&)—'The
prosecution's avowed disbelief in
Lieutenant Thomas H. Massie's ac
count ol the killing of Joseph Kaha
hawai failed to daunt the young
navy officer today and he left the
witness stand with his story intact
except for a few nicks made by the
cross questioning.
Public Prosecutor John C. Kelley
delivered the brunt of his examina- j
tion after publicly announcing the ;
belief that Massie did not hold the |
pistol which killed the young native ■
and hinting that Albert O. Jones, j
another defendant, was the actual i
slayer. Kelley also termed as "the i
bunk" the defense effort to plead
insanity for Massie.
