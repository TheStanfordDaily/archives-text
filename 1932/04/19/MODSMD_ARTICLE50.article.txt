# WATER POLOISTS TELL STORY OF S.C. BATTLE; SWIMMERS SWEEP EASY FIELD
## 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
An exciting picture of the closely |
contested water polo game with j
U.S.C. was painted by the Indian j
warriors and coaches on their re- j
turn from Los Angeles yesterday.
Within thirty seconds of the end |
of the game, with the score tied at j
4-4, Austin Clapp whipped in a goal i
attempt which found its mark. But ;
Clapp was adjudged to be within
the two-yard line when he threw
the ball, and not only was his win- ;
ring goal disallowed, but he was I
thrown out of the game. For the I
rest of the time six Indians fought
seven Trojans to a standstill, await- !
ing the start of the extra period. ,
Tide Turns
For two-thirds of the three-min- j
ute extra period the same six Red- j
skins had to stand up against the ,
S.C. onslaught; up to this point no ;
Stanford water polo team had ever i
tasted defeat from U.S.C., but finally i
the Trojan managed to storm the i
walls and shove in the fatal goal.
Frank Booth scored three of the i
Indian goals, and Clapp one. Goalie j
Burke Knapp showed up better in
the extra period than in the main
portion of the game. Following the i
Trojan contest, the Cardinal seven '
vented its anger on California, I
shooting in 16 goals to none in a j
game which was cut two minutes |
short. In a half-time game with |
U.C.L.A., the Farm poloists took a {
2-0 win, having only six men in the <
pool for the entire second half.
Stanford took first place in every j

] swimming event in which an Indian
I was entered, except one; Fred Teb
; betts was barely touched out in the
! 150-yard backstroke by Plescia,
Trojan stai\
Cards Take Pair
The 50-yard free style was a
: clean sweep for Stanford, McKclvey,
Gardner, and Graves finishing in
( that order. Likewise, the century
went to the Cards by a clean sweep
; featuring the same trio of experts
( in a different order—Gardner, Mc
! Kelvey, and Graves. Captain Frank
Booth won the 220, with Clapp tak
i ing second, and these two reversed
, finishing order to take first and
i second in the 440.
| Bob Clark took the 200-yard
j breaststrokc, followed by Ray Wil
bur, and the Cardinals captured
| both the medley relay and the 400-
J yard relay to complete the conquest.

Tide Turns
For two-thirds of the three-min- j
ute extra period the same six Red- j
skins had to stand up against the ,
S.C. onslaught; up to this point no ;
Stanford water polo team had ever i
tasted defeat from U.S.C., but finally i
the Trojan managed to storm the i
walls and shove in the fatal goal.
Frank Booth scored three of the i
Indian goals, and Clapp one. Goalie j
Burke Knapp showed up better in
the extra period than in the main
portion of the game. Following the i
Trojan contest, the Cardinal seven '
vented its anger on California, I
shooting in 16 goals to none in a j
game which was cut two minutes |
short. In a half-time game with |
U.C.L.A., the Farm poloists took a {
2-0 win, having only six men in the <
pool for the entire second half.
Stanford took first place in every j

I was entered, except one; Fred Teb

Cards Take Pair
The 50-yard free style was a
: clean sweep for Stanford, McKclvey,
Gardner, and Graves finishing in
( that order. Likewise, the century
went to the Cards by a clean sweep
; featuring the same trio of experts
( in a different order—Gardner, Mc
! Kelvey, and Graves. Captain Frank
Booth won the 220, with Clapp tak
i ing second, and these two reversed
, finishing order to take first and
i second in the 440.
| Bob Clark took the 200-yard

J yard relay to complete the conquest.
An exciting picture of the closely |
contested water polo game with j
U.S.C. was painted by the Indian j
warriors and coaches on their re- j
turn from Los Angeles yesterday.
Within thirty seconds of the end |
of the game, with the score tied at j
4-4, Austin Clapp whipped in a goal i
attempt which found its mark. But ;
Clapp was adjudged to be within
the two-yard line when he threw
the ball, and not only was his win- ;
ring goal disallowed, but he was I
thrown out of the game. For the I
rest of the time six Indians fought
seven Trojans to a standstill, await- !
ing the start of the extra period. ,
