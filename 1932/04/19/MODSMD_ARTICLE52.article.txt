# FOUR BABE TRACK STARS GIVE HOPE FOR 1933 VARSITY
## Olympic Prospects Also Loom Encouraging As Frosh Improve 
### Al Guerard 
Four ouslanding freshman track J
stars, possible candidates for the j
j 1932 Olympic team, will add invalu- ;
| able strength to next year's varsity j
| track team. These men arc Al 1
; Blackman, Phil Morentin,
! Devlin, and Lloyd I Schween.
Blackman, defeated but once dur- ;
j ing a whole season in which he was [
| handicapped by torn ligaments, has j
! proved the outstanding freshman j
; sprinter on the coast this year. His

J best times have been 1.0 flat for the !
I 100, 21.7 for the 220, and 49.4 for j
i the 440. Blackman will rest from all |
! track work for at least two weeks,
j and then may start in training to J
! run the 200 or 400 meters in the j
: sectional Olympic tryouts to be held ]
in July. Although his chances in the j
' 200 meters would be rather slim j
against such sprinters as Bob Kiesel, ;
| Ralph Montague, and Les Hables,
; Blackman appears to be the best
: Bay region quarter-miler except [
j Ben Eastman and possibly Fred:
; Waltz of the Olympic Club.
Schween Promising
Lloyd Schween's mark of 6 feet, !
: 2 inches is indeed encouraging, since
; there has been a dearth of good high I
j jumpers on the Farm stretching back j
i to the days of Bob King.
Dave Devlin, who won the two- }
mile run against the Bear Cubs, is J
! training for the 10.000-meter grind'. |
! Phil Morentin may also enter this j
j event. Although Morentin is the I
j better miler of the two, Devlin's;
: Stamina gives him an edge in the j
J longer distances.
