Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, champion of the "dunking" plan
of eating cornbread and potlikker, explains his method to Senator
Joseph Robinson (right). The occasion was the formal introduction of
"potlikker" to the senate restaurant. It was prepared under the direc
tion of Long who sent his clerks scurrying around Washington for
turnip greens and "four bits' worth of dry salt meat."
