# Senate Pares Prohi Enforcement Funds In Economy Budget
## Johnson Proposes Five Million Dollar Slash While Dry Leaders Rally Forces To Down Extra Motions To Reduce Rum Demands 
### 
ASIIINGTON, April IS. (/P) —The Senate today almost unaimously
approved a million dollar cut in the $11,000,000 prohibition enforce
ment fund, hut the prohibitionists rallied to overwhelm two proposals
for deeper reductions. Senator Johnson stirred up the first prohibition
battle of the session with a proposal to cut the enforcement fund to
$">,125,000, "in the interest of economy." Dry leaders assailed the drastic
cut and after a brief flurry defeated the motion, 42 to 17.
* Two Votes Opposed

J The million-dollar slash was then ;
I approved, with two opposing votes — j
I Costigan and Howell.
"We must face the reality," John- j
, son told the Senate, "and we all |
know the kind of prohibition en- :
forcement we get today can be ob- j
I tained in ample quantity for $5,- j
I 000,000.
j "This cut will make no difference '
| in character or quantity."
Shcppard Defends Law
( Senator Sheppard replied:
"A law may be said to be enforced
| when a majority of the people obey i
{ it and a majority of the prosecu
! tions under it result in convictions, j
"Undoubtedly, prohibition is meet- i
ing that standard. In my opinion it
is a distinct success. I think this re- |
duction of 50 per cent would cause!
serious harm."
I The million-dollar reduction in
| the enforcement fund was recom- :
mended by the Appropriations Com- \
mittee in carrying out the Senate's I
order for a 10 per cent cut in the
j bill carrying appropriations for the
| State, Justice, Commerce, and La
i bor departments.
