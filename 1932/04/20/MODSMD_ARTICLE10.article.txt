# Actor Rehearses 'Romeo And Juliet' Uproariously
## 
### HARRISON FOSS 
While Juliet admired Romeo in '
his new lights, and Stan Bcaubaire
was extracting his sword from where J
he had nearly put it through a |
painted stone wall, Dr. Margery
Bailey admitted that she never had
any desire whatsoever to be a pro- j
fessional actress.
First dress rehearsal for the Dra
matic Council's production of )
"Romeo and Juliet" was in full |
swing and at (he moment Dr. Bailey
was demonstrating to James Sandoe
how to .stand so that his orange- |
tighted legs would look neither bent
in nor bent out. "Of course, every
intelligent person likes to act," she
said. "I have advised quite a few
to go on the stage, but its lack of
home life and the continual depen
dence on public opinion never did !
appeal to me."
Not Immune
Even Dr. Bailey, who is all but \
star as the Nurse in "Romeo and
Juliet," comes in for a share of the
director's storming. When Robert |
Brauns appeared tit the top of a
flight of .stairs in a purple and

orange costume, she let out a guffaw
that held up rehearsal for almost
five minutes while everyone from
Juliet to the wardrobe mistress came
under Harold Helvenston's wrath.
Brauns entered again and there
wasn't a .sound in the Assembly
Hall.
Miss Bailey and Helvenston have
.spent a long time in cutting the
tragedy and have produced an un
usual version. The production next
Friday night will show the scene
wherein Juliet's family discover her
apparently dead and where, after
they have left, the servants treat
the situation in a rough manner
with an effect that is entirely lost
in most modern productions. Also
the sccne in the tomb after the
tragic death of Romeo and Juliet
will be shown following out the
original rhythm of the play by
bringing the two families together,
A Career
When Dr. Bailey started to col
lege she fully intended to be a
journalist, but her aspirations to
| write were dashed after taking
' freshman composition—in fact, she
I never took another composition
i course. Her next deside was to be a |
j libr: irian and to dwell among books. I
j Three months in the catalogue divi- \
; sion of the library finished that, j
! Finally there was an opening in the j
; English department, and she took j
! it, liked it, and has taught ever j
j since.
Besides taking a great interest in >
! dramatics, and having appeared in (
I a number of local productions, Dr. ;
i Bailey finds time to paint and draw. ;
i She is best remembered on the ;
) campus for her work in "The Swan," j
| "The Torch Bearers," and "The Si 1 -
! ver Cord."
j "'Romeo and Juliet' is admirably)
I suited to amateur production," .she
said, "being easier to do than any i
of Shakespeare's comedies."
