# CAMPUS POLITICS CAUSE RUCTION IN "BLUE AND GOLD"
## 
### 
BERKELEY, April 19. (/P>â€”
Seven of the nine members of
the sophomore staff of the
Blue and Gold, yearbook of the
Associated Students of the
University of California, re
signed today in a row over ap
pointment of Helen Dale Lang,
junior student from Fullorton,
as women's manager for next
year.
The seven sophomores served
notice because they considered
Gwendolyn May Beuver of Ful
ton better fitted for the office
of women's manager than Miss
Lang, and declared they were
trying to break a hold allegedly
held on the women's manager
ship for the past four years by
members of the Pi Beta Phi
sorority.
