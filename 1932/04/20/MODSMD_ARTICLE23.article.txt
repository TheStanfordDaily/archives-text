# Social Scientists Refute Charges Against Hoover

Rallying to the defense of Hoover
: iii the interests of fair play and
justice, five Stanford professors
| from the social science department
' absolutely discredit the recent at-
I tacks on President Hoover, especial
i ly the famous book, "The Strange
Career of Mr. Hoover: Under Two
Flags," by John Ham ill. These men
: are not all Republicans nor Hoovcr-
I crats, but the malicious lies con
cerning Hoover's past have roused
1 their indignation.
Professor of history and director
of citizenship Edgar Eugene Robin
! son comments on the Hamill book
i thus: "I can recall no President of
1 the United States who has not been
; subject to severe attack upon his
| person, his career, and his family.
Perhaps our day has more of it—in
| volume and intensity; it would be
J hard to make a fair comparison.
This particular attack is weak in
i presentation, feeble in reasoning,
j and utterly inconsequential for seri
ous discussion. Thoughtful oppon
ents of Mr. Hoover's policies will
deplore this kind of attack. His sup-
I porters will ignore it. The historian

, will find it of no value in the final
i appraisal of Mr. Hoover, but they
may well use it as a document re
vealing a brand of politics in the
age in which we 'live, and as a
: revelation of the minds and thoughts
| and emotions of great masses of our
j people. It is not a pleasant picture,
j Assistant professor of history
Thomas Andrew Bailey cites exam
' pies of the same tactics in American
; history. Presidents Washington, Jcf
' ferson, Adams, Jackson, Lincoln,
Cleveland. Roosevelt, and Wilson in
I particular were viciously attacked
in like manner.
Harold Henry Fisher, lecturer in
history, states: " 'The Strange Career
of Mr. Hoover' is based on false and
abbreviated documents, distorted to
i change their meaning. Hamill's quo
i tations are carelessly or deliberately
[ misquotations. A refutation of the
! book is difficult because each sen-
I tence must be proved wrong. The
, author's psychology is to make so
I many charges that a complete refu
tation is almost impossible. People
ireading the book are apt to see
through some of the errors, but they
! will think that 'where there's smoke,
| there's fire.'''
Fisher, with George I. Gay, for
| merly of Stanford University, has *
| published in a book, "The Public
I Relations of the Commission for Re- j
| lief in Belgium," all of the docu- '
I ments relating to the Hoover relief I
' in war-torn Belgium. This book ab
| solutely disproves the two Hamill
! chapters on the Belgium case. Ac
! cording to Fisher, Edith Cavell,
J English nurse, was not charged with j
j being a spy by the Germans ever ;
| officially, but. was executed for aid- |
| ing Allied prisoners to escape, and
j Hoover had nothing to do with her ;
j "murder."
Professors Cottrell and Stuart of I
| the political science department will ■
j answer some of Hamill's arguments I
i tomorrow.
