Rallying to the defense of Hoover
: iii the interests of fair play and
justice, five Stanford professors
| from the social science department
' absolutely discredit the recent at-
I tacks on President Hoover, especial
i ly the famous book, "The Strange
Career of Mr. Hoover: Under Two
Flags," by John Ham ill. These men
: are not all Republicans nor Hoovcr-
I crats, but the malicious lies con
cerning Hoover's past have roused
1 their indignation.
Professor of history and director
of citizenship Edgar Eugene Robin

in like manner.
Harold Henry Fisher, lecturer in
history, states: " 'The Strange Career
of Mr. Hoover' is based on false and
abbreviated documents, distorted to
i change their meaning. Hamill's quo

[ misquotations. A refutation of the
