Shut-putters nil over the world
try for years to do it; coaches pray
for it; but. Nellie Gray does it.
In an ordinary, unostentatious
practice workout yesterday, the
bulky Card weight man tossed the
less bulky iron spheroid a neat. 50
feet 1 inch with a calm flick of his
wrist. Nellie and John Lyman, were
engaged in one of their friendly
little practice sessions when the
Gray one got off his heave. Lyman's
effort measured 48 feet, 10 inches,
and Laborde reached the 47 foot, H
inch mark. Incidentally, the hitter's
best throw in the Big Meet traveled
48 feet, 10 inches, and he didn't
place!
"Bring 'em On"
The spikemen have started work
in earnest this week for their al
ready famous meet-to-be with the
Cromwell tracksters running for the
University of Southern California at
Los Angeles. In fact, the Indians
have been pointing for that meet
since the season started, which is
one reason for their mediocre show
ing against California.
In spite of the "scarlet and gold"
press of the southern part of the
Golden State, Ellington's men expect
to infuse a bit of unwelcome cardi
nal into the color scheme. Hopes
for a victory over Troy, and they
still remain, are based solidly on the
expectation of garnering 17 or 18
points in the weights. Which is why
the Messrs. Lyman, Gray, Grey, La
borde, and Jones toil long and la
boriously every day in the far and
obscure corners of the old oval.
"Captain, My Captain"
Captain Alvin Hables, the inactive
inspiration of the team, has tired of
yells instead of points as his con
tributions to the squad's welfare. So
he has decided to get back into real
shape in time to renew his acquain
tanceship with one Art Woessner of
U.S.C., and yesterday Ike ran a 352
easily to finish one and one-half
yards behind Ralph Giberson in 38.6.
Hables's strength is returning and
'tis welcome news, as few quarter
milers can beat him when he is in
the best of shape.
Another invalid has started goinj*
around on a vaulting pole instead of
crutches, he being the justly famous
Bill Miller. Miller will also be in
condition for the Trojan fracas, and
has aspirations of leaving the high
flying Mr. Graber.just an inch or so
behind him.
The Card broad-jumpers, who
have shown decided signs of needing
parachutes to keep them off the
ground at various times during the
season, got up in the air over at
Berkeley Saturday, both Werder and
Butler surpassing the 23-foot mark.
They were out there in the wind
and cold yesterday working away at
improvement, as 23 feet isn't good
for more than a point against U.S.C.

Jim Ferric and A1 Storms ran two
half-miles within 20 minutes, El
lington's watch stopping at 2:07 and
2:10. George Naylon, under threats
of having to repeat the race if he
didn't run a G6O in 1:25, obligingly
ran 1:24.0, with Roy Hundley getting
second. Eastman and Nash ran tha
inevitable 352 in 40 flat.

Cromwell tracksters running for the
University of Southern California at
Los Angeles. In fact, the Indians
have been pointing for that meet
since the season started, which is
one reason for their mediocre show
ing against California.
In spite of the "scarlet and gold"
press of the southern part of the
Golden State, Ellington's men expect
to infuse a bit of unwelcome cardi
nal into the color scheme. Hopes
for a victory over Troy, and they
still remain, are based solidly on the
expectation of garnering 17 or 18
points in the weights. Which is why
the Messrs. Lyman, Gray, Grey, La
borde, and Jones toil long and la
boriously every day in the far and
obscure corners of the old oval.
"Captain, My Captain"
Captain Alvin Hables, the inactive
inspiration of the team, has tired of
yells instead of points as his con
tributions to the squad's welfare. So
he has decided to get back into real
shape in time to renew his acquain
tanceship with one Art Woessner of
U.S.C., and yesterday Ike ran a 352
easily to finish one and one-half
yards behind Ralph Giberson in 38.6.
Hables's strength is returning and
'tis welcome news, as few quarter
milers can beat him when he is in
the best of shape.
Another invalid has started goinj*
around on a vaulting pole instead of
crutches, he being the justly famous
Bill Miller. Miller will also be in
condition for the Trojan fracas, and
has aspirations of leaving the high
flying Mr. Graber.just an inch or so
behind him.
The Card broad-jumpers, who
have shown decided signs of needing
parachutes to keep them off the
ground at various times during the
season, got up in the air over at
Berkeley Saturday, both Werder and
Butler surpassing the 23-foot mark.
They were out there in the wind
and cold yesterday working away at
improvement, as 23 feet isn't good
for more than a point against U.S.C.

Jim Ferric and A1 Storms ran two
half-miles within 20 minutes, El
lington's watch stopping at 2:07 and
2:10. George Naylon, under threats
of having to repeat the race if he
didn't run a G6O in 1:25, obligingly
ran 1:24.0, with Roy Hundley getting
second. Eastman and Nash ran tha
inevitable 352 in 40 flat.
Shut-putters nil over the world
try for years to do it; coaches pray
for it; but. Nellie Gray does it.
In an ordinary, unostentatious
practice workout yesterday, the
bulky Card weight man tossed the
less bulky iron spheroid a neat. 50
feet 1 inch with a calm flick of his
wrist. Nellie and John Lyman, were
engaged in one of their friendly
little practice sessions when the
Gray one got off his heave. Lyman's
effort measured 48 feet, 10 inches,
and Laborde reached the 47 foot, H
inch mark. Incidentally, the hitter's
best throw in the Big Meet traveled
48 feet, 10 inches, and he didn't
place!
