# FINANCE IN HIGH PLACES
## 
### 
The two master minds who mercilessly eraek the whip
over the cowering and defenseless A.S.S.I '~ namely Robert
M. Hrown, student body president, and Albert L. Denney,
student manager, have concocted a brilliant scheme to save
the student fund all kinds of money.
This financial stratagem consists of setting up a joint
fund to which the three publications, the (Ihaparral, Quad
and the Daily, will contribute a certain percentage of their
profits. Then if any publication incurs a deficit greater
than can be taken care of by its own fund for that purpose,
it can draw out of this general fund and not have to call
on the A.S.S.I', for help.
This stroke of genius presents some very obvious and
important defects. In the first place the amount of profits
that could be turned into such a fund is so small that it
would take years before the fund would be large enough
to be of any use. The money could be more usefully di
verted into the individual funds of each publication and
would there be at least an equal safeguard to the A.S.S.U.
Each publication is an individual business enterprise
and as such should be on a firm basis, independent of the
others. If one or two of the publications are weak, they
should be discontinued or else made sound financially and
not drag the strong publications down with them. If they
all are firm, the joint fund is worse than useless, for it
would only cause friction among the publications while
giving .aid to none.
Another thing that has apparently been overlooked by
these two wizards of finance is that only one publication
consistently turns in a large profit. Consequently the fund
would be ! uilt up mainly from the earnings of that publi
cation for L use of the other two. It is bad enough to
tangle three separate businesses all up together with the
resulting friction and trouble if something is to be gained.
Hut to combine them financially when the benefits will be
almost negligible is an unsound business policy.
I'he proposition was rejected unanimously by the Publi
cations Council, which is supposed to know something
about such matters yet these two queer fellows persist in
thinking that it is a good idea.

Shame oil you, Mr. Hrown and Mr. Denney. Better
things were expected of you.
