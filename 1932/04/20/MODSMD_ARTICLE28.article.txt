# COLUMBIA INVESTIGATES

### 
Heed Harris, ousted Columbia Spectator edilor, may
have been a hot-headed publicity seeker, irresponsible and
tohiHy lacking in judgment as various critics have charged,
but he is even now receiving a measure of vindication
which proves that he had a real basis for the editorial out
burst that resulted in his expulsion from the university.
Harris asserted that one of the campus dining halls was
being run under a system of graft and inelliciency and that
student employes were being treated unjustly. For saying
this in print he was ollicially condemned by the Columbia
administration. Hut the directness of his charges impressed
those in authority to such an extent that they agreed to
institute an investigation of the hall in question. Composed
of three faculty and three student members, a committee is
at present launching ;i thorough survey of the situation, de
claring that it is disposed neither to whitewash nor con
demn.
If he has accomplished nothing else, Harris has at
least established in a striking manner the right and ability
of a student paper to point out campus evils and to force
consideration of them. II seems probable that in this case
abuses exist which need correction. If that is shown to he
the case, Harris will have the satisfaction of public vindica
tion, but even if the charges were ungrounded his fiery
campaign will not have been wasted. He has established
the Spectator in an effective position for future usefulness
along this line. After the great public resentment against
the ejection of Harris it is unlikely that the administration
of Columbia will again take such drastic action against a
crusading editor, while the paper's prestige among the ma
jority of the students has undoubtedly been enhanced.
