# BULL SESSION
## THESE PERSONALITY MAYORS 
### 
The Honorable Angelo Rossi —
Mayor of (he Metropolis of San
Francisco —handing the "key of the
city" to a robot named "Tin Face
Harry," or some such thing, is the
sad subject of a current newspaper
photo. That the whole thing is sym
bolic of the opening of some do
mestic arts exhibit is of course evi
dent and desired. But undesired
and unconsciously, the whole matter
symbolizes to many the senile
depths lo which these mayors find
no difficulty in reaching.
If Mayor "Jimmy" Walker started
this welcoming orgy he cannot be
too severely blamed, for he had a
good reason. Welcoming people gave
Jimmy an obvious opportunity for
staying away from the Mayor's of
fice. Nothing could result from his
sitting in the official chair except
possible embarrassment to the Tam
many men who take care of the
"drudgery" of the office. One might
say aviation saved Walker. His
transoceanic aviation speeches mark
his peak—and a new high for all
welcoming mayors. But Walker had
color; one enjoyed him; he appealed
to the eye and the ear.
Out here on the coast, California
had one rival to Walker. That was
"Sunny Jim" Rolph. He had the
color of the New Yorker subdued
and mellowed. He w:is appreciated

! and we made him Governor. Frisco ,
' then chose somebody who is an ob- i
| vious reflection of Rolph—the re- '
j flection being produced on an im- l'
| perfect, old-fashioned ranch mirror, I
i that has been standing untouched |
, on the garage floor for twenty years, j
i Rossi lacks color; he attempts to t
i smear gay paint all over himself to j
; appear attractive to the people. The j
; result is pitilul.
A certain amount of grandstand |
lis necessary in a democracy. But i
' some field work is vital. Most im- !
i portant to the mayor himself is not i
[to attempt to be a "personality" ;
| mayor without having that kind of a
i personality. Rossi was a business
: man. Why not stress that? He might
click on that key but is registering
i four flats and half a dozen discords
i with his present antics.
What is more, these personality
j mayors are degrading the value of
1 the "city keys." They are more com
mon than kitchen pass keys and less
1 valuable. One thing has always
i puzzled me. Do these celebrities who j
have their picture taken with the j
i "Key to the City" keep it after the I
camera clicks or return it —the same J
key being used over and over again? j
. j If they keep it, who pays for mak- j
; ing these myriads of keys? And why j
can't some enterprising college stu- j
i dents get the contract?
