# The 						WINDJAMMER

### 
THE EAST
Most Honorable ex-Friends:
This trip of ours is getting to be
a very complicated thing, on account
of The Powers who mapped the
thing out only mentioned an occa
sional port of call but expect us to
take in the whole works so that
Stanford University may become
travel-conscious at last.
We sent the promised Ha
waiian letter home by carrier
pigeon, but he started flying the
wrong way and by this time is
probably engaged in transport
ing BB guns for the Chinese
governments. That was an in
spiring letter, too, all about the
tourists who hang around court
rooms, and what the island poli
ticians said under their breath
when the island queen for the
Mask Ball lost out in the final
battle.
Received our first mail from home
yesterday, and we wish to thank
you all heartily for your interest.
Cameronbleater supplied us with
the latest gossip and postage stamps.
And there was a package with a re
turn address K.K.G. in the corner.
We thought "How nice, an alarm
clock," but it turned out to be a
time bomb. The things don't ex
plode properly in this climate,
though, so we sent it right back.
Thanks, anyhow.
Oh, yes—there was another
package, too. with no sender's
name attached. It contained a lot
of circulars about "Elect Boyles
in 1932'' and we've been dis
tributing them all morning. Most
of the natives don't read, of
course.
We showed some of the news
papers, printed last Friday and Sat
urday in the Bay Region, to somo
of the highest Javanese officials (or
Podunks, as they are called here)
and a shipload of them are sailing
at noon today to see what they can

do about putting speakeasies on a
sanitary paying basis.
Inspected the coffee plantations
this morning. The natives import
their own coffee from South Amer
ica, now, because all the Javanese .
crop for the last six months is be- '
lieved to be highly poisonous. Of j
course this has no effect at all upon !
their exports. The Javanese women
are very interesting, being not at
all like the ones in movies. Not so
good looking, but they wear fewer
clothes. Their national motto, j
strangely enough, is "The Winds of i
Freedom Are Blowing.''
Tomorrow we plan to spend
bouncing back and forth be
tween China and Japan. Have a
lot of letters to deliver for cam
pus cooks, and we hope to brush j
up on our Oriental profanity.
This side of the Pacific is very '
calm and beautiful, the bottom being I
composed of clay and fine senti- '
ments. Someone send us a poetical ,
geologist.
We are anxious to get on onevr
into Tibet. We've seen the one
who trills on the tennis courts
(or is that Paderewski?) but
they say this one knows quite
<i lot of llamas.
Yours trustfully, —W.

in 1932'' and we've been dis
tributing them all morning. Most
of the natives don't read, of
course.
We showed some of the news
papers, printed last Friday and Sat
urday in the Bay Region, to somo
of the highest Javanese officials (or
Podunks, as they are called here)
and a shipload of them are sailing
at noon today to see what they can

do about putting speakeasies on a
sanitary paying basis.
Inspected the coffee plantations
this morning. The natives import
their own coffee from South Amer
ica, now, because all the Javanese .
crop for the last six months is be- '
lieved to be highly poisonous. Of j
course this has no effect at all upon !
their exports. The Javanese women
are very interesting, being not at
all like the ones in movies. Not so
good looking, but they wear fewer
clothes. Their national motto, j
strangely enough, is "The Winds of i
Freedom Are Blowing.''
Tomorrow we plan to spend
bouncing back and forth be
tween China and Japan. Have a
lot of letters to deliver for cam
pus cooks, and we hope to brush j
up on our Oriental profanity.
This side of the Pacific is very '
calm and beautiful, the bottom being I
composed of clay and fine senti- '
ments. Someone send us a poetical ,
geologist.
We are anxious to get on onevr
into Tibet. We've seen the one
who trills on the tennis courts
(or is that Paderewski?) but
they say this one knows quite
<i lot of llamas.

THE EAST
Most Honorable ex-Friends:
This trip of ours is getting to be
a very complicated thing, on account
of The Powers who mapped the
thing out only mentioned an occa
sional port of call but expect us to
take in the whole works so that
Stanford University may become
travel-conscious at last.
We sent the promised Ha
waiian letter home by carrier
pigeon, but he started flying the
wrong way and by this time is
probably engaged in transport
ing BB guns for the Chinese
governments. That was an in
spiring letter, too, all about the
tourists who hang around court
rooms, and what the island poli
ticians said under their breath
when the island queen for the
Mask Ball lost out in the final
battle.
Received our first mail from home
yesterday, and we wish to thank
you all heartily for your interest.
Cameronbleater supplied us with
the latest gossip and postage stamps.
And there was a package with a re
turn address K.K.G. in the corner.
We thought "How nice, an alarm
clock," but it turned out to be a
time bomb. The things don't ex
plode properly in this climate,
though, so we sent it right back.
Thanks, anyhow.
Oh, yes—there was another
package, too. with no sender's
name attached. It contained a lot
of circulars about "Elect Boyles
in 1932'' and we've been dis
tributing them all morning. Most
of the natives don't read, of
course.
