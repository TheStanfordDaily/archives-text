I SUMMER NIGHT — By Sylvia
Thompson. Little, Brown and Co.
(Tt the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
The characters that pass through j
I "Summer Night" are obviously j
' planned to be contrasting, and the ]
! result is a sustained tension that i
! becomes irritating after the first few j
i chapters.
Sylvia Thompson has become !
I known as master of the novel of j
| modern English life. Her last book, j
j "Portrait of Caroline," seemed to t
: indicate that there would be a steady j
1 advance in her work, but "Summer j
: Night" turned out to be a decided |
! back-slide.
In "Summer Night" the author j
i gives her puppets so little to do j
! that it is no wonder to the reader j
j that they develop all sorts of com- |
I plexes, and have to invent petty in-
I trigues to amuse themselves. Charles
Bitterne, artist and hero of the j
| novel, is described as being particu
larly manly, while everything else !
iin the book, the atmosphere, his '
' friends, and the things that he says j
j and does, seem to deny it. —J.H.F. j
