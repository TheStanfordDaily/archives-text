WHAT A headache! We dropped
into the gym last night when the
track team was dressing, and were
they growling! It was no place for
a person of peace-loving disposi
tion. That crew was raving and
ranting, chewing on the benches and
gnawing at the lockers.
The caia.se of it all was a yarn
which appeared in the Long Beach
Press-Telegram, a yarn which pre
dicted the Trojans would garner
some 131 points on April 30. Now
inasmuch as there are only 131 tal
lies to be divided between both
loams in a dual meet,, you can ima
gine how Bill Ellington's lads felt
about the matter.
The eminent Southern sheet's
blurb was tacked up on the locker
room wall, there to remain until the
10th. If its ellect survives until then,
il will be a v/ild-eyed tribe which
leaves for Los Angeles the last of
Ihe month.

THE POOCIIES return to Bel
mont tonight, where an inau
gural program of 10 races has
been hilled. One of the features
tonight will he a hurdle event,
which may provide an unex
pected laugh or thrill—you never
ran he quite sure what a grey
hound will do.
During the opening meeting
last fall, one race was broken
up because a stray eat wandered
onto tiie track, while another had
to be ruled out because one
bright purp, tired of the fruit
less pursuit of the rabbit
around the oval, jumped the
fence and snagged his mechani
cal prey on the back stretch.
Some fast dogs have been im
ported from Florida tracks for
the current meeting, a number
being included in the starters
of tonight's feature event. Rac
ing will begin at 8:15 o'clock.

WORD FROM the South indicates
hat Vic Williams expects to be
eady for another quarter-mile duel
vith Ben Eastman at the Fresno Re
ays on May 14. Williams, star ex-
Trojan, is reported gradually get
ing back into shape following an
ippendicitis operation.
Williams and Eastman met three
imes last year, with Williams get
ing two decisions to Eastman's one.
2ach equaled Ted Meredith's then
unsurpassed record for the 440 dur
ng the season, and in view of Wif
iams' two victories over blond Ben,
J.S.C. supporters waxed enthusias
ic indeed over their Vic.
This year Eastman accomplished
vhal Stanford track authorities have
>een expecting for some time,
racking the world mark for the
li.stance wide open—buy a full sec
nd. Yet we read in Splits Editor
/lax Plake's column in the Daily
'rojan that Williams will beat East
nan when they meet again—even
f Ben runs in 46.0 time. Really,
vfexie! —L.M.C.
