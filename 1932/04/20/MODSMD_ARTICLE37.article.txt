## U.S.F. BALL TEAM TO TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT INDIANS Conquest Of Cards Earlier In Season Counted In Dons' Victories 
### Bob Wade 
GAME TODAY
Stanford vs. U.S.F. on the Sunken
Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.

Bent on bringing the once mighty
Stanford Indians nearer their own
cellar position, Coach Gene Valla's
Dons from the University of San
Francisco invade the campus this
afternoon for the second game of
the series, to be played on the
Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.
So far, the Dons have had a rather
disastrous season, but their three
victories have all been in the nature
of upsets, and all have been over
teams that were gunning for the
championship. Their . first conquest
was over a surprised Berkeley Bear,
who tried pitching a man just off
the basketball squad.
Pitching Weak
Next, these cellar champions
pulled the few remaining feathers |
out of the Stanford Indian's scalp- I
lock. And finally, they dumped the |
! U.C.L.A. applecart to the tune of j
17-1.
j The biggest reason for their pres- I
| ent position has been a weak pitch- j
j ing corps. Usually they have been |
j lucky to get out of a game without j
! having to use at least three hurlers, j
i but in the final contest against the j
| Bruins, Huntley hurled the full nine 1
innings and did a creditable job of |
it.
With another game scheduled for j
Saturday, Coach Harry Wolter will i
probably choose Estes and Massey |
I as his starting battery. Herm pitched !
| a nice six innings against the Dons j
; in the initial battle, and should last j
■ the route today.
Massey Improves
Massey is improving with every [
game, and should be able to alter -
! nate with Livermore in the games
, next spring. His main trouble seems !
to be in digging out the fast ones i
if they land around the batter's feet, j
Wolter might decide to give some I
| of the substitutes a chance in these !
last two contests, depending on how [
much he wants to win them. If he
j does, Triplett may return to short, i
i Hearn to first base, and Irsfeld be !
! tried in the outfield. The team will |
be losing two outfielders, a second
baseman, and a pitcher when the
next graduation comes around, and
a little experience wouldn't hurt ;
| some of the substitutes who haven't J
rated much attention so far.

GAME TODAY
Stanford vs. U.S.F. on the Sunken
Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.

Bent on bringing the once mighty
Stanford Indians nearer their own
cellar position, Coach Gene Valla's
Dons from the University of San
Francisco invade the campus this
afternoon for the second game of
the series, to be played on the
Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.
So far, the Dons have had a rather
disastrous season, but their three
victories have all been in the nature
of upsets, and all have been over
teams that were gunning for the
championship. Their . first conquest
was over a surprised Berkeley Bear,
who tried pitching a man just off
the basketball squad.
Pitching Weak
Next, these cellar champions
pulled the few remaining feathers |
out of the Stanford Indian's scalp- I
lock. And finally, they dumped the |
! U.C.L.A. applecart to the tune of j
17-1.
j The biggest reason for their pres- I
| ent position has been a weak pitch- j
j ing corps. Usually they have been |
j lucky to get out of a game without j
! having to use at least three hurlers, j
i but in the final contest against the j
| Bruins, Huntley hurled the full nine 1
innings and did a creditable job of |
it.
With another game scheduled for j
Saturday, Coach Harry Wolter will i
probably choose Estes and Massey |
I as his starting battery. Herm pitched !
| a nice six innings against the Dons j
; in the initial battle, and should last j
■ the route today.
Massey Improves
Massey is improving with every [
game, and should be able to alter -
! nate with Livermore in the games
, next spring. His main trouble seems !
to be in digging out the fast ones i
if they land around the batter's feet, j
Wolter might decide to give some I
| of the substitutes a chance in these !
last two contests, depending on how [
much he wants to win them. If he
j does, Triplett may return to short, i
i Hearn to first base, and Irsfeld be !
! tried in the outfield. The team will |
be losing two outfielders, a second
baseman, and a pitcher when the
next graduation comes around, and
a little experience wouldn't hurt ;
| some of the substitutes who haven't J
rated much attention so far.
