# GOLF TOURNAMENT ASPIRANTS START QUALIFYING TODAY
## Medal Round To Be Ended Before Next Tuesday, Twiggs Rules 
### Maurice Rapf 
Qualifications for the Stanford
i University golf tournament get un
i der way today as those in quest of
i the local championship begin com-
I petition with the first eighteen holes
j of medal play.
j The big guns of the Stanford
| course, fresh from their team tri
i umph in Los Angeles, will be forced
i to go up against each other in this
j tourney, but not for the first time
; this year. Members of the Cardinal
I squad have been wreaking havoc on
j all the Bay Region courses lately,
! upsetting older and more experi-
I enced players, so that a good deal
; of prestige goes along with the win
-1 ning of this tourney.
Outsiders Threat
But aside from Eichelberger, Sea
ver, Hellman, and company, there
will be capable golfers entered who
are not members of the squad, as
anyone enrolled in the University
is eligible to shoot eighteen holes and
turn in his score to Eddie Twiggs,
golf pro, before next Tuesday, the
final day for the first round cards
] to be registered. The best 32 scores
| will be bracketed for the match
j play.
I Charley Seaver, Harry Eichelber
â€¢ ger, Herman Hellman, Stuart Haw
ley, and Jerry Trautman, free from
his baseball duties, loom as the out
standing candidates to win the title
which was taken by Lawson Little
1 last year.
The dark horse of the event will
be Dick Hoag, who shot a beautiful
09 to defeat his teammate, Seaver,
i in the first round of the Pacific Coast
| championships in Los Angeles last
week. Hoag is capable of the most
brilliant golf, but is an erratic player
who is likely to fall by the wayside
in a long tournament.
Certain members of the varsity
will take time off this week-end to
travel to San Jose for the city
, championships, the first rounds or
which will be played Saturday and
Sunday. Little, present University
champion, also holds the San Jose
: title.
