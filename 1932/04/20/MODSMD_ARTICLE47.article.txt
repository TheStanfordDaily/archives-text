: Stanford's freshman swimming
team will meet the strong Sequoia
High-School squad this afternoon
i at 3:45 o'clock in the Encina pools.
; Although Sequoia is reputed to have I
one of the strongest high-school '
, teams in Northern California, Coach j
I Nort Thornton's yearlings are ex-
I pected to win handily.
It is possible that the Indians may
! take first in every event, although
I Dick Martin of Sequoia, who has
i been winning most of his team's I
I points, may win the backstroke, i
I 20-yard dash, or diving. Martin is j
I exceptionally strong in all three \
[ events and may take first in one or I
; all of them.
Another factor which will handi
cap the freshmen is the fact that '
high-school distances will be swum,
and men who have been swimming
longer distances will have to re
adjust their times. This will espe
cially affect Jim Benet, who will !
swim only one hundred yards in I

the breaststroke instead of the usual
two hundred.
Coach Thornton will use Dick
Hirsch, st;ir dash man, and Chuck
Boothe in the 50-yard free style;
