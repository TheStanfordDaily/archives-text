# BURTON SPEAKS ON PATRIOTISM
## Speaker Leads Discussion, Following Lecture 
### 
Stating that the settlement of the
turbulent affairs of the world grow
' ing out of nationalism and preju
dice-bound attitudes can occur only
through the exercise of individual
thought and action, John Burotn
British engineer and pacifist, spoka
last night in the Assembly Hall on
"Science Re-Defines Patriotism."
Patriotism was formerly a neces
sity, Burton stated, but the World
War and the present economic crisis,
proving the triumph of interna
tionalism, has theoretically changed
the modern attitude from the bigot
ted attitude to one which calls for
j individual action.
Leadership Training
The thought of the masses cannot
; be changed without leadership, and
the duty of the universities is not
! to turn out the "regular fellow," but
j the leader who is willing to risk
| criticism for his own and the world's
i future peace, he claimed,
j "Patriotism needs up-to-date re
i definition in which the superficial
j differences between men will be re
j placed by world citizenship and
i cosmopolitanism," Burton said. The
i universities, he stated, have the re
| sponsibility for this move, because
! they set the tone for education.
Modern science, he believes, may
and must show that the "educated
| man is one for whom learning has
j erased prejudice."
Individualism
I "World peace rests on individual
| ism," the speaker continued, "and
j education should produce leaders
i who know what they believe, and
j have the courage to prove it." Bur
ton qualified leaders as being
I "unique and powerful."
Following the lecture, Burton con
j ducted an informal discussion with
I his enthusiastic audience. He will
speak tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse on "Mak
' ing Peace Dynamic." In his second
' talk Burton will show that the chal
lenge of peace is as great an ad
venture as war.
