# Seniors Begin Donations For Fund Campaign
## 
### 
Circulars explaining the purpose
of the Senior Endowment are being
mailed to members of the Class of
'32, according to Bill French, chair
man of the Senior Endowment Com
mittee. At a meeting of the group
held last Tuesday afternoon, J. E.
McDowell, alumni executive secre
tary, described the history of the
committee from its origin in 1900
to its present position.
A fund to be raised through sub
scription blanks is donated annually
by the graduating class. Seniors may
subscribe in a lump sum or agree
to give a certain amount which is
to be paid whenever convenient.
Subscribers are contacted yearly
through the Alumni Association, ac
cording to McDowell.
The amount raised by the com
mittee is turned over to the admin
istration for any desirable or expe
dient purpose. The former practice
of providing insurance with every
subscription has been discontinued.
The Senior Ball Committee met in
the executive room of the Old Un
ion last Tuesday evening to discuss
and consider programs and favors
for the Senior Ball, which has been
tentatively set for June 17.
Orders for Senior Week Programs
and engraved announcements are
being taken daily in the Alumni
Office by McDowell and will be ac
cepted up to Saturday, April 30.
The programs contain the schedule
for Senior Week activities, class of
ficers and committees, and gradu
ate list and candidates for advanced
degrees, according to Karl Falk,
chairman of Announcements Com
mittee.
