## 
### BOB PLACE 
Appearing recently during the fi
nancial crisis and before the presi
i dential election of this year, "The
| Strange Career of Mr. Hoover: Un
; der Two Flags" by John Hamill has
1 had a great influence on unthinking
voters in the United States, in its
I charging of the president with prac
j tically every possible crime.
Edwin Angell Cottrcll of the po
| litical science department says:
i " 'The Strange Career of Mr. Hoover'
| is a malicious distortion of fact verg-
I ing on criminal libel. It. is an under
, handed attack on a man in an official
position who cannot fight back bc-
I cause of the dignity of his office.
The appearance of 'Herbert Hoover:
I An American Tragedy' is a suffi
cient refutation for those who wish
!to form calm and unbiased opin-
I ions."

| Strange Career of Mr. Hoover' is j

Chatterly's Husbands,' 'The Inti- I
; mate Journal of Rudolph Valentine,'
and 'Memoirs and Mistresses,' has I
already served a term in jail for I
selling obscene literature.
"The second count is that the book
is full of ridiculous and deliberate
misstatements of fact, such as that
when a student Herbert Hoover had

i when he learned the use of carpcn- I
ters tools; later that Mr. Hoover 1
was an Englishman, that Belgium
did not need food relief, that the
