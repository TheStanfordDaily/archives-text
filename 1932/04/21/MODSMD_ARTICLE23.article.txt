# ORATORY NO USE STATES BURTON
## 
### 
As evangelistic in his fervor off
stage as he is on the speaking plat
form, John Burton, philosopher, lec
turer, and very human and likeable
Englishman, yesterday admitted that
| oratory is of little value.
''I have stopped all oratorical
l methods of speaking," he explained,
, "because I now realize it is an il
legitimate means of swaying people.
They applaud oratory, but forget the
| message, if indeed, there can be any
J message delivered during an ora-
I tio.n. Wild speaking can exercise
; only a temporary influence, and half
j an hour later the listeners are as
j big fools as they were before."
Cultured Englishman
Burton is the conventional young
I cultured Englishman. Handsome,
! well-dressed to :i point that Middle
; Westerners would consider foppish,
j and having the traditional English
| manner, he is a "smoothie" in the
I best sense of the term.
! "A lecturer speaking to 1000 peo
j pie is fortunate if he can make one
understand his message," said Bur
j ton. "There is no way in which you
I can change people in large numbers.
! ft is the individual who must
i change, and that is done only by
i continuous association with a new
idea.
Legislation for Morality
"You cannot legislate people to
i morality: prohibition is an example
J of this. A law may force people to
| be good temporarily, but that is nol
1 (be right way to make them good.
! I don't want a society that is in a
; suspended condition of evil
i People are quickest to criticize in
! others the very faults which they
| themselves possess Most of
J the people who think they are help
ing othersâ€”the prohibitionists and
i foreign missionaries -are a very un
| pleasant type, bigoted, hypocritical,
j and with a desire-for-power com
! plex.
"Patriotism should be re-defined
; 1o include a world patriotism; the
j advance of civilization has made
this nerestarv if we are to survive
