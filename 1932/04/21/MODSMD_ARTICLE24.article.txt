# Injuries Lower Indian Chances In Trojan Meet
## Meier and Butler to Bear Brunt of S.C. Attack in Hurdles And Broad Jump as Brugman and Werder Are Forced Out of Practice GIBERSON AGAIN RUNS TRIAL CENTURY IN 9.8 Rumors That Eastman Had Sprained Ankle Untrue; Stumbled on Stairs, But Not Injured 
### 
US MEIER, long-legged, sun-tanned sophomore hurdle ace, and Wall.v
Butler, veteran varsity broad-jumper are likely to be two extremely
busy gentlemen on the afternoon of April ;»0. For the two men who were
expected to furnish Meier and Butler with some much-needed help in
the highs and the broad-jump in the U.S.C.-Stanford track meet both
checked in yesterday with injuries of more or less serious nature.
Jack Brugman, after a thorough examination by the kindly medical
staff of Stanford University, reported that the leg he injured in the
Big Meet may not heal in time for him to match strides with Payne,
Bills, and Welch of the Trojans. And Bill Werder, who was just getting

• into real shape, pulled a strained
| muscle in his upper leg that will
| keep him out of training for five
days at least.
Blame the Temperature
Werder's injury occurred in yes
j terday's workout, when he was try
i ing to buck the wind and cold while
, | running a 100. The muscle just
snapped and refused to function, and
now Werder will worry instead of
broad-jump until Monday. There is
| a chance, however, that Bill's injury
I will help more than hurt him, as he
! has a habit of jumping his best after
j a lay-off.
When Brugman hit the first hur
j die in the California affair, he fell
j and the hurdle did likewise. As a
; result, Jack now has a gory cut on
his knee and what may turn out to
be a twisted tendon. Brugman's luck
is as tough for the Indian cause as it
is for himself, as the rest of the
high-hurdlers, with the exception
of Meier, aren't quite in U.S.C.'s
class. Packard is still hurt, and
Stallings has not yet recovered his
15.1 junior college speed because of
an operation.

Ralph Giberson continues to give
I 'em the works in the practices, yes

Gibey will be out to get third place
in that Trojan 100, figuring to beat
Ball and Delby and also giving no
odds to either Wykoff or his team
mate, Les Hables.
