# REJOICE; THE GATES OPEN
## 
### 
For several years Sunday afternoon tennis-playing on
the Farm lias been a hazardous undertaking. Students
have had to trek over to the old class courts uncertain
whether or not they would he aide to get in a set or so
before dinnet lime, and certain that if they could, it would
he on a poor court and would conic only after waiting an
hour or so for picnickers from all over the-Hay Region to
have out their fun.
While waiting, these students would gaze with annoy
ance and wonder at the locked gates of the empty varsity
courts, trying to figure just why they were closed and pos
sibly weighing the chances of climbing over to steal a
couple of games unnoticed.
Hut today devotees of the court sport may rejoice, for
Sunday afternoon tennis has come into its own. The H.A.C.
lias worked out a plan whereby the varsity courts will be
open from dawn to dusk on the Sabbath, and will be re
served exclusively for persons connected with the Univer
sity.
Although the move will entail expense and effort on the
part of the H.A.('., the gratitude of students will prove it a
worthv one.
