# CONSTITUTIONS AND STUDENT OFFICERS
## 
### 
Candidates for student body olTices at I'.S.C. must at
tend a class on the Associated Student Rodv constitution
and pass a test ;il the completion of the course. If they
Hunk the ex they are automatically disqualified for ollice.
While il would probably be considered cruel and un
usual punishment to make local campaigners take a simi
lar test, there appears to be, nevertheless, a need for some
thing of the sort here. A knowledge of the limits of their
powers would be a very good thing for our various gov
erning bodies, Ex Committee, Women's Council, Men's
(ouncil, and the rest.
Last fall Women's Council promulgated an edict for
bidding Stanford women to work at the bonfire. Much ex
citement was created, and matters were not improved when
il was discovered that Council had no power to make rules
of that sort, such functions being delegated to Conference,
in this case both the officers and the women whose rights
they infringed were apparently ignorant of the AAV.S. con
stitution. as il remained for the Daily to point out Council's
error.
The A.S.S.I', and A.W.S. constitutions are not so simple
that a mere glance through the Freshman Bible makes one
familiar with their provisions. They form the basis upon
which our student government is run, and a thorough ac
quaintance with them is the lirst requisite for anyone in a
position of authority. Il is probably too much to hope that
candidates on llie Farm will ever be forced to demonstrate
Iheir possession of this elementary qualification, but it is
:il least a thought worthy of consideration. Miracles do
happen.
