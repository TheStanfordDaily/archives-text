For the newest allele in the culture movement it is nec
essary to turn to Oklahoma, that virile land where home
steaders fought and swore over a piece of land, where
cowboys cursed unruly cattle and mushroom towns filled
with hardened characters sprang lip overnight.
Oklahoma I Diversity has banned the use of slang. Any
use of il in the classrooms is to be reported by the profes
sor - and such students who are careless enough to utter one
of these forbidden words may suffer the loss of their di
ploma, according to an editorial in Ihe I nircrsih/ Daihj
Jumsdii.
The editorial continues in part: "The decree will have
a most deplorable effect upon the Sooner morale. Freedom
of speech will be completely curtailed. Speech of any kind
will be almost impossible. Whole collegiate vocabularies
will have to be remodeled. lUlggedness and energy will
gave way to a spirit of effeminate decadence.
Manning of slang may be another "noble experiment,"
bill Oklahoma lias evidently forgotten something which is
hazardous to forget in that state these days. Imagine what
"Alfalfa Hill" Murray will say when he hears of this. And,
worse luck, Ihe university won't be able to take away his
diploma for saying it. Fawncv that, Oklahoma.
