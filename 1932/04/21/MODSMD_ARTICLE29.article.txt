ONE HOUR WITH VOU—At the
Stanford Theatre.
There are three reasons why you
shouldn't miss this: Ernst Lubitseh,
Maurice Chevalier, and Jeanette
McDonald.
Lubitseh lias done his usual mas-
J terly job of direction. Dozens of
brilliant touches throughout the film
' all help to boost his record as one
of the most scintillating directors in
Hollywood.
Maurice Chevalier is excellent as
i the young doctor who is torn be
tween maintaining his professional
dignity, and acquiescing to an occa
sional unprofessional fling. Jeanette
i McDonald is the flighty, tempera
mental wife who is everlastingly
suspicious of her mate's actions.
There's a theme song, but strange
ly enough, it isn't at all unpleasant.

STRICTLY DISHONORABLE — Al
the New Menlo Theatre.
This picture has good acting and
good actors, but many flaws in a
too fantastic plot. Paul Lukas is ac
ceptable as a temperamental Italian
opera singer and lover combined.
Sidney Fox, as the dimunitive and
| somewhat innocent heroine—plays
her part well.
i But—we can't quite conceive of a
girl about to embark upon marriage
1 not knowing and fully realizing the
■ meaning of spending the night in
! the apartment of a newly acquired
admirer.
And—there is also a lousy play
upon a pun about an Orangeman
who lived in West Orange, New
Jersey.
Also—the heroine's villainous
i fiance was a bit too nasal in his
speech, besides being extremely un
pleasant toward the girl whom he
though was to be his future wife.

As a Soul hern belle, Sidney Fox
| makes up for a lot of the Haws, and
i Lewis Stone comes through as usual
| with an extremely fine character
I portrayal. If you go, go at 7:30—
| the shorts are almost inexcusable.

ALIAS TIIE DOCTOR—At the Var
sity Theatre.
The always dependable Richard
; Barthelmess again turns in an ex
cellent performance, and this time
!in a fine picture of medical life.
Barthelmess is a medical student at
j Munich who, before he receives his
j diploma, goes to prison for the crime
j of Stephan Brenner, whose sister he
| loves and whose mother as moth-
I ered him and given him the family
I name. Through a series of perfectly
i logical circumstances after his re
i lease, Karl assumes the name and
I diploma of Stephan, who has died,
J and becomes a world-renowned
! surgeon.
The plot is an unusual one, and
iis well-handled. It is the sort of
I plot in which melodrama would be
| easier injected than omitted, and
the quality and excellence of the
; film is due to its omission. The en
j tire last half of the film moves along
| on a high plane, with interest stead
] ily rising to the climax. This climax,
| in which Barthelmess, after his mas
i querade has been discovered, per
i forms an operation on his foster
' mother, is a masterpiece of suspense,
! Less than a dozen words are spoken
j during the entire scene, and it is
| more effective than a thousand
, words.
In addition to the splendid work
I of Barthelmess, the picture contains
• a fine performance by Lucille La
j Verne, who imbues her part of the
I foster mother with restraint and
j sympathy.
There ought to be a law against
j such shorts. —EC.
