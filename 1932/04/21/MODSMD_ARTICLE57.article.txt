# BICYCLING CO-EDS RECALL PAST AGE
## 
### 
Shades of yesteryear began to run
rampant on the campus recently
J when three Roble co-eds inaugur
! ated the annual bicycle exposition.
I Old pictures of the Quad dotted
with the vehicles have nothing on
i Roble's front yard nowadays. Late
and soon daring maidens may be
seen wheeling, wheedling, and
wending their ways through the
throngs.
Modern conveniences to grace the
antiquated self-propelling machines
include the lunch-basket effects be
| fore, and a none-t.oo-well-renovated
! kerosene lantern swinging from
handlebars, not to mention, of
I course, a coy 1932 version of the
divided skirt.
j Well, well, little girls, and well!
