# Stanford Nine Takes U.S.F. Series With 7-6 Victory
## DONS LOSE EARLY LEAD WHEN CARDS STAGE 2 RALLIES Delmas, Miles Pole Long Hits To Drive In Five Of Winning Runs 
### Bob Wade 
After spotting the Dons from the
University of San Francisco to four
runs in the first inning, and two
more in the third, Stanford's varsity
baseball team came back yesterday
to eke out a 7-6 victory on the
sunken diamond.
The Cards recovered a pair of
markers in their half of the first
frame, and got a man on in both
the second and third, but failed to
score on cither occasion. Just to
prove that the Farm understands
good old Southern hospitality, they
then turned around and let Harri
son, Don second-sacker, poke one of
Estes' offerings out of the lot, scor
ing Selix ahead of him.
Stanford Scores
Stanford tallied again in the fifth,
and then in the sixth put on their
own little scoring spree to push
three digits up on the scoreboard,
and tie up the game. This great
burst of power was made possible
largely through the efforts of short
stop Delmas, who poled the ball jusf.
out of outfielder Selix's reach. In
the ensuing scramble for the ball
Selix became entangled in his own
legs and failed to return it home in
time to catch the nimble Indian.
However, the Cards lost all sense
of hospitality in the following frame.
Massey banged one to shoi*t, and
that obliging gentleman heaved the
little pill into his own dugout. Mns
sey, who was coasting down the
foul line, woke up to his good luck
about the time that the ball hit the
dugout wall, and changed his course
for second base. Although the next
throw beat him to the base a good
three feet, and the officials called
him out, Captain Rintala dug up an
old custom which says that if an
infielder can hit his own or the op
position's dugout the runner auto
matically rates another base.
Miles Hits Single
With this good fortune as a starter,
Miles hammered one of Preston's
slants past "Tiger" Gaddy at first,
and Massey trotted home with the
winning marker. This was Miles'
second blow of the day, his first
having been one of the few triples
on the home lot this year.
Vince Philippi collected two more
hits to run his total to 11 hits out
of the last 15 times at bat. This
ought to put him over the five hun
dred mark.
Herm Estes chucked nice ball ex
cept for let-ups in the first and
third.

baseball team came back yesterday
to eke out a 7-6 victory on the
sunken diamond.
The Cards recovered a pair of
markers in their half of the first
frame, and got a man on in both
the second and third, but failed to
score on cither occasion. Just to
prove that the Farm understands
good old Southern hospitality, they
then turned around and let Harri
son, Don second-sacker, poke one of
Estes' offerings out of the lot, scor
ing Selix ahead of him.
Stanford Scores
Stanford tallied again in the fifth,
and then in the sixth put on their
own little scoring spree to push
three digits up on the scoreboard,
and tie up the game. This great
burst of power was made possible
largely through the efforts of short
stop Delmas, who poled the ball jusf.
out of outfielder Selix's reach. In
the ensuing scramble for the ball
Selix became entangled in his own
legs and failed to return it home in
time to catch the nimble Indian.
However, the Cards lost all sense
of hospitality in the following frame.
Massey banged one to shoi*t, and
that obliging gentleman heaved the
little pill into his own dugout. Mns
sey, who was coasting down the
foul line, woke up to his good luck
about the time that the ball hit the
dugout wall, and changed his course
for second base. Although the next
throw beat him to the base a good
three feet, and the officials called
him out, Captain Rintala dug up an
old custom which says that if an
infielder can hit his own or the op
position's dugout the runner auto
matically rates another base.
Miles Hits Single
With this good fortune as a starter,
Miles hammered one of Preston's
slants past "Tiger" Gaddy at first,
and Massey trotted home with the
winning marker. This was Miles'
second blow of the day, his first
having been one of the few triples
on the home lot this year.
Vince Philippi collected two more
hits to run his total to 11 hits out
of the last 15 times at bat. This
ought to put him over the five hun
dred mark.
Herm Estes chucked nice ball ex
cept for let-ups in the first and
third.
