structed by Harold Helvenston in j
throe years will he revealed. With .
"Romeo and Juliet" he turns his j
hand to both building scenery and
directing.
T lie general tone of the sets will
be stately simplicity accomplished by j
the use of tall cubic pillars that as j
parts of a unit set will be moved '
about to form the background for i
the various scenes. The use of lumi- j
nous grays for most of the paint j

foundation for spectacular lighting
effects.
Most interesting will be the treat- '
merit of the balcony scene. The bal
cony itself is to be placed far down
stage where the sight lines are best, '
and a short flight of steps will give i
Romeo enough height effectively to
play his part.
