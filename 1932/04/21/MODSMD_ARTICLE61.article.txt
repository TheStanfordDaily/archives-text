# GOLF PLAY HALTED AS WIND BLOWS ON STANFORD FAIRWAY
## 
### 
Heavy winds sweeping the fair
ways of the Stanford golf course
discouraged entrants in the Univer
sity golf tournament from attempt
ing to play their eighteen-hole
qualifying round yesterday.
With the final day for medal round
scores to be turned in having been
set for next Tuesday, it is expected
that those competing will complete
their play within the next few days.
Charlie Seaver, sophomore ace,
has not signified any intention of
entering the city tournament at San
Jose this week-end. but Herman
Hellman, Stuart Hawley, Jerry
Trautman, Dick Hoag, and Bill
Dwyer are traveling south to try
to gain the title won by Lawson
Little, '31, last year.
Among the creatures skinned to
make a college career glorious are
the pig, the sheep, the coon, and
dad.
