YOU NEVER can tell about base- |
ball. There are lots of things you
can't tell about, but you can tell
less about baseball than most
things.
Take Stanford's season, for in- j
stance. There was every reason to
believe the Indian nine should re
tain the championship. The loss of
Johnson didn't do the Tribe any
good, but still prospects of holding
onto the flag looked very rosy in
deed.
Now the season is practically
over, and Stanford isn't even in the
first division. A couple of heart
breaking losses to St. Mary's at the |
start of the race and numerous
boots at critical points during the
season did all the damage.

IT'S JI'ST the same in the
professional game. Detroit, the
American League team which
did its early training here at
Stanford, was given a 50-50
chance to end up in the first
division — and that was about
all. Just now this same Detroit
club is right up at the top of
things, and while the Tigers
may not stay there, they are at
least getting off to a great start, j
In the Coast League the San

Francisco Seals ritdn t show
'much promise until the season
got under way—and then they
proved just about unbeatable.
The Mission Club of the same
city made a great showing in
the exhibition games, but try to
find them in the percentage col
umn now!
Another surprise is the bat
tle being put up by Sacramento.
Regarded as Seattle's only op
ponent for cellar honors, the
Senators arc right up among
'em. How long they will stay
there is a serious question —
they've started out like this be
fore, only to collapse when the
Seals, the Oaks or Hollywood
stuck a pin in their balloon,
even when Lou Moreing had
more of a ball club than he
has this year.

Now the season is practically
over, and Stanford isn't even in the
first division. A couple of heart

season did all the damage.

IT'S JI'ST the same in the
professional game. Detroit, the
American League team which
did its early training here at
Stanford, was given a 50-50
chance to end up in the first
division — and that was about
all. Just now this same Detroit
club is right up at the top of
things, and while the Tigers
may not stay there, they are at
least getting off to a great start, j
In the Coast League the San

Francisco Seals ritdn t show
'much promise until the season
got under way—and then they
proved just about unbeatable.
The Mission Club of the same
city made a great showing in
the exhibition games, but try to
find them in the percentage col
umn now!
Another surprise is the bat
tle being put up by Sacramento.
Regarded as Seattle's only op
ponent for cellar honors, the
Senators arc right up among
'em. How long they will stay
there is a serious question —
they've started out like this be
fore, only to collapse when the
Seals, the Oaks or Hollywood
stuck a pin in their balloon,
even when Lou Moreing had
more of a ball club than he
has this year.

YOU NEVER can tell about base- |
ball. There are lots of things you
can't tell about, but you can tell
less about baseball than most
things.
Take Stanford's season, for in- j
stance. There was every reason to
believe the Indian nine should re
tain the championship. The loss of
Johnson didn't do the Tribe any
good, but still prospects of holding
onto the flag looked very rosy in
deed.
