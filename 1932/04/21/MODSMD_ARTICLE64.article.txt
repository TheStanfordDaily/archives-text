## Colored Shirts Issued To Aid Squad Play 
### 
With a regular scrimmage game
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon,
Coach Warner gave his first two
squads a /est yesterday and sent
some of his "eserves through a short
scrimmage, following the regulai
routine of blocking and tackling.
The men who participated in yes
terday's scrimmage were unac
quainted with the new plays as they
had hud little experience in their
use, and the practice session failed
to reveal anything startling. Many
of the freshmen who have just come
out, following the close of the lrosh
baseball and track seasons, went
through their paces for the first
time.
At Monday's practice various col
ored shirts were issued to the first
four squads for use in the forth
coming scrimmages. This will en
able the players to distinguish be
tween the various elevens, and will
give certain combinations practice
in playing together.
The first-string backfield has been
lining up with Walker at quarter
back, Hillman, fullback, and Lam
bert and Maentz, halves. In front
.of this quartet is a line of Albertson,
center, Corbus and Kite or Card,
guards, and Rogers and Tod, ends.
The tackle situation has been con
stantly shifting, with Lettunich,
Palamountain, Prelsnik, Keller, and
Rogers alternating on the first two
teams.
