Headlining today's mural games, |
the Breakers nine, runner-up in last j
year's ball championship and win- !
ner of two seasons ago, plays the J
men from Alpha Kappa Lambda on |
the frosh diamond today in the first
lound of League 111 hard ball play.
The other game in this division
features the PI 1 i Kappa Sig and the '
1 Delta Chi squads.
The only frosh team to enter the !
I mural leagues, Encina lE, faces the |
] Sequoia I team in the indoor group, i
j In the second fracas of the soft ball '
i section the Kappa Alphas tussle I
1 with the Kappa Sigs.
Sigma Chi Strong
During this first week of mural j
, play the Sigma Chi team has made j
1 one of the strongest bids for the j
j championship with the 19 to 4 win j
I over Sequoia I, last year's con- j
querors. Another team to display 1
title prospects was the El Toro nine '
which garnered a 10 to 9 victory
from El Cuadro.
The increasing interest shown in |
the budding soft ball sport threatens
to overshadow the prospects and j
life of hard ball play with the pos- j
l sibility of the indoor sport growing
j into a major mural sport next sea- j
I son. The Los Arcos, the Tau
I Omega, and the Phi Gamma Delta
j outfits have secured wins in the
j soft ball games in the first two
I leagues.
Umpires Needed
' Because of time conflicts in the
playing of the hard ball games in 1
the past few days, Gene Mires noti- '
fies competing nines that all mural j
teams must be on the designated '
fields, prepared to play by 4 o'clock.
Mires announces also a shortage in
I the umpiring staff, and the intra
mural department will pay selected
persons, ball fans who sign up with 1
him and who are capable of umpir- j
ing league games, a fee of $1 per !
game for officiating.
