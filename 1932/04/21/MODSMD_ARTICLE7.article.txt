# WORLD CRISIS IS LECTURE TOPIC
## Makes Peace Dynamic Says British Individualist 
### 
I Contending that the turmoil of
j world affairs has a distinct basis in
I the individual, and can be remedied
! only by the conscious effort of each
! to analyze his own contributions to
; this chaos, John Burton, British
! pacifist and individualist, lectured in
| the Women's Clubhouse last night on
j "Making Peace Dynamic."
World peace, Burton believes, is
; the desire of every intelligent per
! son, but the causes for the present
| crisis are the results of his own tur- i
! bulent contributions.
I
Spread of Prejudice
National prejudices and traditions
' have spread from the individual to i
j world affairs, he stated, and have '
i become so embroiled in the general j
plan that the individual has lost [
| sight of his own responsibility.
The requirements of the achieve- i
, ment of world peace, Burton said, !
! include an analysis of v what each in- j
dividual is contributing to the pres- j
! ent state of affairs, and the sacrifice
|of prejudice for personal serenity j
j which will be reflected in world |
j matters.
The realization of the superficial- |
j ity of war, he stated, can come j
! either through another chaotic cri- !
! sis, or by the reformation of petty !
selfishness for a "free society of en- j
! lightened people."
Individual Thought
j Individual thought and action, j
! Burton continued, is the only way j
the world may realize the goal of j
j peace. "The masses can never be j
! trained to see the problem as indi- ;
j viduals, but leaders who are willing !
to think and act for themselves with- j
| out authority or tradition are the |
i only means by which we may make 1
; of peace a living thing for all time," j
: he said.
The lecture last night was fol- j
lowed by a discussion, as was Bur- I
ton's first talk Tuesday night. The j
| forum after the first lecture con- j
i tinued unitl 12:15 o'clock, after)
members of the audience left the ]
Assembly flail for' the Union.
