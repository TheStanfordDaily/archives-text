# McClintock Writes Of Duties As Vice Consul
## 
### RONALD CHINN 
Life holds little boredom for Rob- !
ert Mills McClintock, Stanford
graduate of 1931, for he is now per
forming the varied duties of a
United States vice consul at Panama
City, he writes in a recent letter to [
Professor Graham Stuart.
McClintock's activities' vary from
coding telegrams to attending mur
der trials of Americans in Panama
courts. He interviews all sorts of ,
people, from the highest officials to .
the lowliest of Chinese shopkeepers \
for information which any United j
States taxpayer has a right to ask
his government.
Made Highest Mark
When the young vice consul took
his examination for the foreign ser
vice last year, lie made the highest
mark of any who took the test. It
was only last April that he received
his A.B. in history.
Besides having been Stanford's
member of i California debate team
which matched with many uni
versities in England, he has also de- ,

! bated in Hawaii, has been a mem- !
ber of the Joffre debate team which j
| each year clashes with that of the J
Bear debaters across the bay, and j
has won first place in the ex tern -
| poraneous speaking contest of the I
Pacific Coast Forensic League. He is
I a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
Rivalry Unfortunate
Commenting upon recent efforts of ,
; the government to economize, Mc- I
i Clintock says they might well begin |
j on the duplication of effort between j
| the commerce department and the !
j foreign service. "The two rival each \
j other for their reputation for efTi- ;
ciency in promoting trade. Hence a j
manufacturer of railway equipment,
inquiring its to the Panama market,
may be astonished to receive a
voluminous letter about a Panama
railroad 100 miles long.
"We answer letters from American
firms who seek markets in Panama
for everything from velocipedes to
heating appliances, regardless of the
climate or the poverty of the peo- j
, pie," the writer said.
