# Rolph Blasts Hope For Mooney Pardon With Flat Refusal
## Preparedness Day Parade Bomber Takes Verdict News With Grim Smile, Mocks at Justice in Quentin Cell as Mother Weeps 
### 
AN FRANCISCO, April 21. (A J ) —Tom Mooney, who was denied ;•
pardon, by (Governor James Rolpli, Jr., today said in a statement issued
; by the Tom Mooney Moulders' Defense League that he "had no chance
whatsoever of receiving a fair and impartial hearing from representatives
of as unprincipled a bunch of pirates as ever scuttled a ship."
i
SACRAMENTO, April 21. (VP) —With a blunt finality that stunned those
, who had hoped for executive clemency, Governor James Rolph, Jr., today
| unconditionally declined to grant a pardon to Tom Mooney, ex-labor
j leader convicted of bombing the San Francisco Preparedness Day parade
of June 22, 1916. The Governor, the fourth to flatly refuse to liberate

the man, whose sympathizers
throughout the world have long re
yarded as a martyr to the cause of
labor, made his findings public in
an atmosphere charged with tension
and expectancy.
As he read his brief statement,
the silence of the packed room was
broken only by the click of tele
graph instruments which caught his
words as they fell from his lips and
flashed them to the four corners of
the world.
The decision came after nearly
five months of deliberations during
which Governor Rolph had the ad
vice and counsel of Matt I. Sullivan,
former Chief Justice of the State
Supreme Court.
In an adjoining room, Mooney's
aged mother in the care of her
daughter Anna and a member of the
Tom Mooney Moulders' Defense
Committee, waited uncomprehend
ingly the reading of the decision that
once again blasted her son's hopes
for exoneration and freedom.
The words, a mere drone at her
distance, completely escaped her
ear. "What is he saying? What is he
saying?" she kept repeating, and
when told that the decision had been
unfavorable she appeared not to
understand.
With a smile of resignation,
Mooney himself received the verdict
in the office of Warden James B.
Holohan at San Quentin Peniten
tiary where he has spent nearly
sixteen years. It was apparent that
he had built little hopes upon the
result of his latest effort to clear
his name of the crime for which
he was convicted, but persons in
his confidence did not expect that
the door would be so completely
closed to possible future considera
tion by the present governor.

of June 22, 1916. The Governor, the fourth to flatly refuse to liberate

the man, whose sympathizers
throughout the world have long re
yarded as a martyr to the cause of
labor, made his findings public in
an atmosphere charged with tension
and expectancy.
As he read his brief statement,
the silence of the packed room was
broken only by the click of tele
graph instruments which caught his
words as they fell from his lips and
flashed them to the four corners of
the world.
The decision came after nearly
five months of deliberations during
which Governor Rolph had the ad
vice and counsel of Matt I. Sullivan,
former Chief Justice of the State
Supreme Court.
In an adjoining room, Mooney's
aged mother in the care of her
daughter Anna and a member of the
Tom Mooney Moulders' Defense
Committee, waited uncomprehend
ingly the reading of the decision that
once again blasted her son's hopes
for exoneration and freedom.
The words, a mere drone at her
distance, completely escaped her
ear. "What is he saying? What is he
saying?" she kept repeating, and
when told that the decision had been
unfavorable she appeared not to
understand.
With a smile of resignation,
Mooney himself received the verdict
in the office of Warden James B.
Holohan at San Quentin Peniten

sixteen years. It was apparent that
he had built little hopes upon the

his name of the crime for which
he was convicted, but persons in
his confidence did not expect that
the door would be so completely
closed to possible future considera
