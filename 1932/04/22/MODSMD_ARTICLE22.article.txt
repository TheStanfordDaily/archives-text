# CO-EDS CAN SMOKE BUT NOT AT DANCE
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, April 21. (/P) Women j
students at Washington University j
here have won another equal rights j
battle. They recently petitioned the |
school authorities for permission to
smoke when and where they please. |
on the campus, in the buildings, on
the athletic fields just like the men. I
At first their request was denied.
Then a compromise was reached.
Now the girls have three special !
smoking rooms in campus buildings
and they also smoke at social func
tions. They are. however, specifically l
barred from smoking on the dance !
floor.
