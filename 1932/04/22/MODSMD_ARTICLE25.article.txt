# COACH CANCELS VARSITY TRACK PRACTICE MEET
## Bill Ellington Will Put Men Through Regular Paces This Afternoon CARDS SET FOR TROJAN Templeton Bans Week-End Cinder Competition 
### Dick Strouse 
Although he has decided against
the regular practice track meet
scheduled for this afternoon, Coach
Bill Ellington plans to put some of
the boys through their paces by con
tinuing the daily time trials that
have marked a hectic week of
workouts. When the Stanford In
dian and the Trojan horse meet
April 30, that noted Redskin is go
ing to be in shape.
Dink Templeton let it be known
yesterday that the team members
will not be allowed to compete in
the Gaelic Association meet in Kezar
Stadium Sunday. This week-end
was left open so that the men could
be properly conditioned for the
U.S.C. clash, Dink said, and he does
not propose to lose this advantage.
There is, however, a possibility that
a few athletes, who would run no
risk of a setback, will be permitted
to enter.
Why Not Everything?
After watching Ben Eastman run
three laps with ease in the fine time
of 3:14, Track Coach Ellington
turned to Publicity Director Lieben
dorfer and said, "You know, Don, I
think I'll keep Ben out of the hur
dles and the two-mile down South."
"Why not let him run every
thing?" asked Liebendorfer, and El
lington was stumped for an answer.
Eastman's jaunt yesterday proves
that Ben is a miler as well as a
middle-distance runner. But he will
limit himself to only the quarter,
the 880, and the relay in the U.S.C.
meet, figuring that 15 points is
enough for any man to contribute
to a ti'aek team's total.
Kay Developing Form
A1 Ray spent yesterday, as he has
all week, working on the intrica
cies of correct javelin-throwing
form, contenting himself with easy
tosses of 185 feet or thereabouts.
Ray's record this year has been
better than that of the Trojan
spear-tossers, although Williamson
threw some 200 plus feet as a fresh
man.
Ralph Giberson, fresh from his
win over Ralph Montague of S.F.U.
in Wednesday's practice, again had
the best time yesterday among the
multitude that ran 352'5. He re
corded 38.8, the wind slowing him
up considerably.
Azevcdo Looks Good
Cot to Herbert and Gus Meier
registered 39.6 and 39.8 respectively.
Captain Alvin Hables, Paul Nash,
and Frank Lombardi were others
who tiied the elongated sprint.
Art Azevedo, looking stronger
every time he runs, trotted around
the track most of the afternoon, fol
lowed by Paul Aebersold. Art un
corked a nice sprint at the end of
his windings, and should be a much
improved two-miler when the big
Trojan fracas finally arrives.

U.S.C. clash, Dink said, and he does
not propose to lose this advantage.
There is, however, a possibility that
a few athletes, who would run no
risk of a setback, will be permitted
to enter.
Why Not Everything?
After watching Ben Eastman run
three laps with ease in the fine time
of 3:14, Track Coach Ellington
turned to Publicity Director Lieben
dorfer and said, "You know, Don, I
think I'll keep Ben out of the hur
dles and the two-mile down South."
"Why not let him run every
thing?" asked Liebendorfer, and El
lington was stumped for an answer.
Eastman's jaunt yesterday proves
that Ben is a miler as well as a
middle-distance runner. But he will
limit himself to only the quarter,
the 880, and the relay in the U.S.C.
meet, figuring that 15 points is
enough for any man to contribute
to a ti'aek team's total.
Kay Developing Form
A1 Ray spent yesterday, as he has
all week, working on the intrica
cies of correct javelin-throwing
form, contenting himself with easy
tosses of 185 feet or thereabouts.
Ray's record this year has been
better than that of the Trojan
spear-tossers, although Williamson
threw some 200 plus feet as a fresh
man.
Ralph Giberson, fresh from his
win over Ralph Montague of S.F.U.
in Wednesday's practice, again had
the best time yesterday among the
multitude that ran 352'5. He re
corded 38.8, the wind slowing him
up considerably.
Azevcdo Looks Good
Cot to Herbert and Gus Meier
registered 39.6 and 39.8 respectively.
Captain Alvin Hables, Paul Nash,
and Frank Lombardi were others
who tiied the elongated sprint.
Art Azevedo, looking stronger
every time he runs, trotted around
the track most of the afternoon, fol
lowed by Paul Aebersold. Art un
corked a nice sprint at the end of
his windings, and should be a much
improved two-miler when the big
Trojan fracas finally arrives.
Although he has decided against
the regular practice track meet
scheduled for this afternoon, Coach
Bill Ellington plans to put some of
the boys through their paces by con
tinuing the daily time trials that
have marked a hectic week of
workouts. When the Stanford In
dian and the Trojan horse meet
April 30, that noted Redskin is go
ing to be in shape.
Dink Templeton let it be known
yesterday that the team members
will not be allowed to compete in
the Gaelic Association meet in Kezar
Stadium Sunday. This week-end
was left open so that the men could
be properly conditioned for the
U.S.C. clash, Dink said, and he does
not propose to lose this advantage.
