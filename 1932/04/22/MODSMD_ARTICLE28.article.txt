# A 						HAZARDOUS UNDERTAKING
## 
### 
"Romeo and Juliet" lias been produced tens, ves, hun
dreds of times, by the best amateur and professional easts
in this country and in the world. Even by these it has been
recognized as a hazardous undertaking.
Primarily, the play is for persons who appreciate Shake
speare's mastery of poetry. Primarily, it is neither plot nor
characterization that has placed it among the everlasting
works of all time.
Therefore it is particularly courageous on the part of
Harold Helvenston and Stanford dramatic stars to attempt
it, fully aware that the same persons who so enjoy "bird
ing" Palo Alto movies will be among those present in the
assembly hall tonight.
Campus producers of this play were aware of this. Their
very realization of the hazard involved in choosing "Romeo
and Juliet" as a campus production has led Helvenston
and his associates to the utmost effort to make the presen
tation perfect. Meticulous in the most minor detail, they
have expended perhaps more effort and expense on to
night's play than on any offered in the past.
Peg Randall Converse and James Lyons, previously
proved two of the most capable of student actors, will ap
pear in the leading roles. The sets are elaborate. Every
thing is set for a smashing success, a success that few lovers
of effective legitimate stage productions can afford to miss.
