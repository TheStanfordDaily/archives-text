# CULTURED FOURFLUSHERS

".Most college students would rise up in 'righteous in
dignation' if they were collectively labelled as cultured
loiirflushers. But that is exactly what a large number (not
all) of them are.
"Nine-tenths of collegians are perfectly willing to bask
in the sunlit haze of blind admiration shed on it by the less
educated mass of humanity. Only a college student him
self knows exactly how ignorant he actually is, and very
few pause to consider their pitiful plight. Why should they,
when it is so easy to fool the world at large? And yet, their
conscience must trouble them at times.
"The average college student has only a thin veneer of
education. I sually he is educated just enough to make
people think he is cultured, lie knows little about the Eng
lish language and rules of grammar, he spells poorly, writes
not much belter than a high school pupil, and cannot carry
on an original thoughtful conversation. He is unable to
shape his thoughts into any organized sequence.
"He deals largely in generalizations and platitudes to
( over up his asininity, and boredom is his screen against
exposure, lie has no burning desire for intellectual en
lightenment. His main interest is in fitting himself to
achieve economic independence and general acceptance
among the 'upper strata.' As long as he 'gets bv' lie is
satisfied. He senses no clear duty to society, but rather be
lieves that society owes something to him. Most of the time
he is not conscious of himself at all he exists but does not
I've. And if he occasionally realizes how ignorant he is, he
usually is too lazv lo do anything about it. Thus it is that
we flatter him by ticketing him as a cultured four-flusher.
Now go ahead and shoot." Tulanc Ilullaballoo.
