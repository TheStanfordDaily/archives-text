WHAT PRICE TRADITION?

i The answer to the question, '"What
i Price Tradition?" in this particular
j case is $190 —usually $200—and a
1 grand total somewhere near $4,000.
i The sudden burst of mathematics
refers to the "class squares" along
| the Quad in front of the Memorial
! Church. Everyone has seen those
! aging brass plates with the nu-
I merals of every graduating class
i since away back before Hoover im-
I planted therein —one set of numer
als per plate.
.
For years had I scraped along
their smooth surfaces without real
izing their financial import. Not
being learned in the arts of metal
lurgy, cementing, and extracting
profit from the University, I had
i never comprehended the great cost
| of these four-sided markers of pass- j
I ing senior classes. As I am this year I
for the first time a senior in the '
i University, the problem had never
' before presented itself to me.
I
j ' On late afternoons when the al
i most last rays of the .sun had fig
| ured the Quad with long shadows,
I we often used to meditate on the 1
Stanford when the first plaque was
laid. Then, growing a bit more philo
[ sophical or anthropoligical, we
i would ponder on what would be
I when, if ever, the chain of metal
squares was finally joined. But now, |
j every time we pass the place, we
I immediately become lost in mathe-
I matical calculation and financial
figuring. The price of $190 per
square cannot be bettered by out
side companies. The vast amount of j
work to make one of these simple
; looking things as a landmark for
gaping lowan posterity boosts the
j price.
j The hitch comes when it is made
I known that the students who last J
I year worked on the thing were paid
i for their labor; and the Stanford
Society (American Society of Me
chanical Engineers) which con- 1
j tracted for the plate reaped a profit.
i This year the profit will be less, !
; due to some added costs and a ten
dollar cut in price—but a material
| gain none the less will accrue. This,
i year, how much v/ill be paid the
; students who work is not yet known.
It is possible that one may even
work for nothing.
One might think that the engineers
would be glad to justify their exis
tence to the liberal arts by volunteer
J effort. The valedictorian will not ask
' monetary remuneration for the
hours of effort in creating his ad-
I dress. If the Senior Class puts on a
"Spring Quarter Follies," the actors
will not demand salaries. And if
i one is interested in metallurgy, it
1 would seem that the same experi
' ence and pleasure comes from mak
j in gthe class plate as the orator
! and dramatist received in their en
deavor.
Recognition could be provided for
: the hardy sons of toil who made the
1 plate by mention of the fact in the
! Senior Day program, in the Daily, in
; the Quad —and if necessary Chapar
ral would probably also unite in '
| giving honor where it is due.
i . 1
It might well behoove the Class of
| '32 to install a small plate this year—
j say about 25 to 50 dollars' worth—
| the difference from $190 being given
jto the Relief Fund. Then, when
j members of this class all become
bank presidents, etc.—famous gen
! erally and financially, we could re- j
| unite and buy a full-sized square.
I It would sort of commemorate the
j depression under whose light or
! shadow we are graduating.
