WAY OK A LANCKK—By Richard
Boleslavski in collaboration with
Helen Woodward. Bobbs-Merrill
Co. I!K12. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
' The ugly fascinates us. We crave
j horror. We enjoy reading about
| war: children being killed; spies \
1 being hung; limbs flying through
the air; and gore dripping from the
face of our hero. War books will
always be popular as long as they
j make war ugly enough. To this ne-
I cessary ingredient, Boleslavski has
; added the thrills of war, the ad- \
j venture and tenseness, and the
| heroism of the romantic cavalry
i troop of the recent war, the Polish
I Lancers.
"Way of a Lancer" is a supposed
jly true account of the Lancers 1
i through the last phase of Russian
j participation in the war and during
the first months of the Red Revolu- ,
tion when the army was a disor- 1
| ganized mass; Russia, a chaos. Loyal
to their nation which had been for i
one hundred and fifty years non- I
j existant, the Lancers became a rov
ing band of marauders, ever mov
ing toward Poland and its freedom
from Russian domination.
The book is a series of bloody ,
incidents, not all pleasant, but in
teresting enough to put the book in
the ranks of the ten best sellers.
| Boleslavski, well-known in the
I theatre, and more recently in Holly
j wood, tells his tales vigorously,
i realistically, frankly, and sexily.
