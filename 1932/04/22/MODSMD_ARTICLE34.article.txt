ANOTHER ONE of those "reliable j
iid official sources" comes along |
/ith the info that at last the Cali- j
jrnia Bears and their little Bruin
rothers down at U.C.L.A. are to |
leet on the gridiron—the 1 all of j
9134 being set for the formal intro- j
uction. j
Lo, these many years the south- |
rn branch of the House of Berkeley j
as been clamoring for the estab- j
shment of gridiron relations with j
ie parent institution, but for one ;
ague reason or another, the Powers !
ave continued to decree otherwise, i
The Bruin cub grew and waxed j
tronger, until finally even U.S.C. ■
efused to play in the Westwood j
ackyard except at the very first of j
he season, because it would be j
lost embarrassing to be upset by J
ie obstreperous youngster in mid- ;
?ason.
NATURALLY ENOUGH, the
Westwooders indignantly refused
to be steam-rollered at the open
ing of the season, before they
had a chance to get organized. I
With Stanford the only mem
ber of California's "Big Three"
left on the Bruin schedule, j
Spaulding's eleven aimed at the
Indian game all last fall—and 1
only the famous Allen-to-Col
vin pass combination robbed the 1
Southerners of a six-to-six tie.
No one who saw that game
could doubt but what U.C.L.A.
was ready for the big time, but
still there was no indication that !
the high moguls over at Berke
ley would relent.
BUT BASKETBALL, somehow,
as different. Both Trojans and |
i;ars found no objection to meeting \
ie Bruins in the court game—luck
y for California last season.
The Bears ran into trouble with
.S.C. at the first of the season, but
ie "little brothers" saved the ,
lampionship for them by obligingly
ropping four terrific battles to the
lue and Gold, and later winning
vo out of three from the Trojans.
Maybe that friendly action of the
ruins had something to do with it.
njjway, it looks as if the little
•others were "in" at last—and it's
ir guess they'll be ready for the
ears in 1034.

A.W.O.L. tennis captain, fared
v\« II in the mid-Pacific invita- I
lional tennis tournament at 1
Honolulu until he reached the
finals. In both singles and dou
bles he lost out just short of the
championship. —L.M.C. \
