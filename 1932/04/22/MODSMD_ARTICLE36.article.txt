# Card Nine Meets S.F.U. In Last Game Of Season
## VICTORY WILL GIVE INDIAN TEAM ,500 AVERAGE FOR YEAR Stan Anderson Probably Will Start On Mound For Stanford Team 
### Bob Wade 
With the last game of the 1932 ;
• season scheduled for tomorrow, and
1 only one win needed to give the
! team an even .500 for its conference
j record, the Stanford nine finishes up
' against Coach Gene Valla s Univer- i
' sity of San Francisco outfit on the j
, Sunken Diamond at 2:30 o'clock,
j A victory tomorrow would not j
only give the Cards an even posi- j
! tion in the final standings, but i
| would give them the Don series and ,
| revenge for the victory that they I
j handed the Indians following defeats i
,at the hands of the Trojans and |
Bears.
Anderson May Start
i In both the other encounters
: against S.F.U., Stanford has spotted '
I the visitors anywhere from six to !
eight runs in the first lew frames !
and then spent the remainder of the ;
contest trying to overcome the self- j
imposed handicap. If they can get i
over the friendly gestures and play j
ball, the Cards should walk off with j
! the game in easy style.
With Estes having beaten the j
Dons in their last-appearance on the j
Farm, Coach Harry Wolter wili i
probably start his ace hurler, Stan j
Anderson, - who has dropped less
i games than anyone else on the .
chucking corps this year. Anderson
lost a heart-breaker to California !
in the final game at Berkeley, and !
except for that defeat would have j
ranked right up with the league's I
leading pitchers.
Masscy to Catch
Behind the plate will be Jim Mas
sey, unless Livermore suddenly re- '
j covers from the injuries which have j
been bothering him since the final ;
Trojan game. Big Ike was pretly
i badly tangled in that battle, ancl 1
| his injuries have not responded to :
j treatment as well as they might |
; have. Massey, however, has been j
; improving steadily, and caught a
1 good game Wednesday.
With Anderson on the mound, j
Coach Wolter has the hardest hit- i
i ting team that he can muster. Andy !
can poke the little ball as well as |
make it talk, and he proved annoy- |
j ing to pitchers who "rest" on the •
opposing moundsman more than |
I once this season.
Miles Improves
The improvement shown by Dick 1
Miles in the last battle bids well for i
the sophomore's future. He is a good ;
fielder and has needed only to im- '
! prove his batting eye to become one ]
of the best on the squad. He and 1
Goldmann should make a nice com- ,
bination when, and if, Lefty returns i
to the Farm.
This will be the last game of in- ;
tercollegiate baseball for Captain I
Rudy Rintala, Gordy Campbell, Er
nie Caddel, Fred Goodell, and Vince i
Philippi.

the sophomore's future. He is a good ;
fielder and has needed only to im- '
! prove his batting eye to become one ]
of the best on the squad. He and 1
Goldmann should make a nice com- ,
bination when, and if, Lefty returns i
to the Farm.
This will be the last game of in- ;
tercollegiate baseball for Captain I
Rudy Rintala, Gordy Campbell, Er
nie Caddel, Fred Goodell, and Vince i
Philippi.
i
With the last game of the 1932 ;
• season scheduled for tomorrow, and
1 only one win needed to give the
! team an even .500 for its conference
j record, the Stanford nine finishes up
' against Coach Gene Valla s Univer- i
' sity of San Francisco outfit on the j
, Sunken Diamond at 2:30 o'clock,
j A victory tomorrow would not j
only give the Cards an even posi- j
! tion in the final standings, but i
| would give them the Don series and ,
| revenge for the victory that they I
j handed the Indians following defeats i
,at the hands of the Trojans and |
Bears.
Anderson May Start
i In both the other encounters
: against S.F.U., Stanford has spotted '
I the visitors anywhere from six to !
eight runs in the first lew frames !
and then spent the remainder of the ;
contest trying to overcome the self- j
imposed handicap. If they can get i
over the friendly gestures and play j
ball, the Cards should walk off with j
! the game in easy style.
With Estes having beaten the j
Dons in their last-appearance on the j
Farm, Coach Harry Wolter wili i
probably start his ace hurler, Stan j
Anderson, - who has dropped less
i games than anyone else on the .
chucking corps this year. Anderson
lost a heart-breaker to California !
in the final game at Berkeley, and !
except for that defeat would have j
ranked right up with the league's I
leading pitchers.
Masscy to Catch
Behind the plate will be Jim Mas
sey, unless Livermore suddenly re- '
j covers from the injuries which have j
been bothering him since the final ;
Trojan game. Big Ike was pretly
i badly tangled in that battle, ancl 1
| his injuries have not responded to :
j treatment as well as they might |
; have. Massey, however, has been j
; improving steadily, and caught a
1 good game Wednesday.
With Anderson on the mound, j
Coach Wolter has the hardest hit- i
i ting team that he can muster. Andy !
can poke the little ball as well as |
make it talk, and he proved annoy- |
j ing to pitchers who "rest" on the •
opposing moundsman more than |
I once this season.
Miles Improves
The improvement shown by Dick 1
Miles in the last battle bids well for i
the sophomore's future. He is a good ;
fielder and has needed only to im- '
! prove his batting eye to become one ]
of the best on the squad. He and 1

bination when, and if, Lefty returns i
to the Farm.
