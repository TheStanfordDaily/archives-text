NEW YORK. April 21. (/P)—Just
• when the Yanks were beginning to
wonder what manner of inertia had

run with the bases full in the- ninth
inning and the A's grabbed a ball j
game, 8 to 6.

; although one was A1 Simmons' cir
, cuit clout in the fourth, went into
i the ninth leading, 6 to 2.
Big Rufus walked Jimmy Dykes
and Mule Haas—the eighth and ninth
i passes he issued—to fill the bases, j
' and Mickey Cochrane promptly hit J
a fast ball so far over Babe Ruth's

that the Bam merely sat down and
picked a sprig of gracs to chew.
George Pipgras finished and al
lowed another score as Jimmy Foxx j
j hit his second triple, counting on
j Bing Miller's long fly.
