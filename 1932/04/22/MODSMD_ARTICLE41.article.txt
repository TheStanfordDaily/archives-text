### BILL MYERS 
I Battling for the Pacific Coast Low
j Goal Championship crown, the Card
poloists clash today with the Weth
erwax team in the tournament finals j
at Beresford.
Dopesters give the Redshirts an ]
even chance for the title. Downing |
the San Mateo Rangers in the semi- :
' finals last Friday, 14-13, the Stan- ,
| ford riders showed up as one of the |
i flashiest low-goal outfits on the
| coast. While the Wetherwax team is j
I rated as a trifle better than the j

Match Featured
Tournament officials are featuring i
! today's tilt as one of the fastest i
i matches of the month at the Beres- j
ford field. Captain Art McCrystal, j
one of the tournament heads, said j
that the Stanford four in their game ;
last week with the Rangers treated j
j polo fans to the scrappiest match of j
! the whole tournament.
Stanford will take the field wilh j
i the same line-up as last week. Pete I
• Gillham, noted for hitting the long- j
est ball on the team, will ride at |
number one. Gillham will have the i
assignment of riding off the Wether- j
| wax number four man so that Rufus •
Spalding at number two can annex i
his customary string of goals.
Spalding to Star
Spalding will be expected to do
most of the scoring. This sharp
shooting ace garnered twice as many
goals in the game last week as any
other player on the team. Although i
he isn't famed as a hard-hitter, his j
never-failing accuracy makes him

invaluable on offense.
Pete Lewis, whose 100-yard goal j
in an extia chukker won last week's i
game, will play his usual number
three position. Lewis' dependability j
| is a big factor in turning back any j
I opposition.
Fine Combination
The condition of the Stanford I
' ponies may play a big factor in the I
. match. Outclassed, on a price basis j
I at least, about six to one, the Card
j mounts will have to play some high- j
; speed polo to compete with the more i
| aristocratic Wetherwax ponies.
Four-Goal Handicap
! Stanford will be spotted four goals
i to equalize the difference in handi
j cap ratings.
i Play starts at 2:30 o'clock this af
| ternoon on the Highway field at
! Beresford. The line-ups:
