### 
Anticipating the Olympic Games
lo be hold in Los Angeles next July,
a complete village has already been
constructed, according to Associated
Press dispatches. It will house the
athletes of all the nations for a
period of a lew weeks, while they
compete in the Olympics.
In less than three weeks, more
than 500 temporary cottages have
been built, each one to accommo
date four athletes. Adjoining these
cottages a large administration
building and several kitchens to
feed the men will soon be put under
construction.
To insure competing athletes
some measure of privacy a heavy
iron fence has been placed to en
close the entire village. The entire
building of the cottages thus far has
taken only three weeks. They will
easily be taken down after the
games are over, and the temporary
little town, erected on the site of
the former Lucky Baldwin estate,
will once more be deserted.
The nations have already signi
fied that they will send a repre
sentation of i) 00 athletes. With al
most 40 countries still to be heard
from, the Olympic Games Village
will probably be well filled with
rival athletes.
