# SONS OF NASSAU STRUT CAMPUS IN 'BEER SUITS'
## 
### 

Keeping alive a tradition harking back to 1!)12 are these seniors of Princeton University, who already have
| donned their "beer suits" which will be worn at graduation in June. The suits, merely white overalls with
I coats to match, according lo tradition were donned so Princetonians of another era would not soil civilian
f clothes when quaffing beer.
