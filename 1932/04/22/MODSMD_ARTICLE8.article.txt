# STATE ENGAGES MORE ALIENISTS AGAINST MASSIE
## Prosecution Demands Torn Record Be Placed As State's Evidence 
### 
HONOLULU, April 21. (/P) —Be-
| hinds the scenes in the trial of four
: persons accused of lynching Joseph
Kahahawai, the prosecution today
fought the defense contention that
Lieutenant Thomas H. Massie was
| insane when he wielded the pistol
j that killed the native.
Court sessions were postponed un
' til Saturday at the request of Public
| Prosecutor John C. Kelley to permit
two newly arrived California alien
ists to prepare evidence for the ter
ritory. These included Dr. Joseph
J Catton, San Francisco alienist who
| recently contributed to the testi
| mony that brought a conviction and
i death sentence to Mrs. Winnie Ruth
1 Judd.
Torn Paper Rouses Rift
The prosecutor did not content
! himself with alienist evidence alone.
! Before the postponement was
j granted he asked Judge Charles S.
i Davis to permit the trial record to
show the paper Mrs. Massie de
stroyed in a fit of anger on the wit
ness stand was permissible as evi
! dence.
The paper, apparently in Mrs.
I Massie's handwriting, supposedly
| told of a rift between herself and
I her husband a few months before
i the attack. It was in the form of
i answer to a psychopathic examina
! tion she had taken at the University
| of Hawaii. Mrs. Massie had asserted
j it was a confidential paper between
| patient and physician and therefore
! was inadmissible as evidence.
Drama Pleases Darrow
I Darrow chuckled today at the
\ memory of Mrs. Massie's spectacular
| outburst on the stand, which he
! called the most dramatic in his long
J career as a criminal lawyer.
"I never saw anything like it,"
j Darrow said. "I've seen some pretty
| good court scenes but nothing like
j that one yesterday. I was pretty
I limp when it was all over. I couldn't
| sleep when I went to bed last night."
i Kelley also grinned at the fit of
temper he exhibited in matching
i Mrs. Massie's fury. He said he had
neglected to have a copy of the pa
; per made.
