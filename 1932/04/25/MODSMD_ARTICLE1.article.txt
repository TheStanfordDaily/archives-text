# TRACK "SUBS" GARNER POINTS IN IRISH MEET
## Grey, Johnston, Williams, Stallings, All Place At Kezar Oval LOMBARDI HURTS LEG Sprinter Cramps Muscle In Trial; Herbert Wins 
### Dick Strouse 
A bounding bunch of Irishmen
from the Western side of the Atlan
tic put on a track and field meet up
at San Francisco's windy Kezar
Stadium yesterday afternoon, and
were forced to watch most of the
honors go to English-named athletes.
Although the members of the regu
lar Stanford cinder team were not
entered in the Gaelic Association
meet, several of the supposed sub
stitutes (with non-Irish names) did
take part in the affair and did right
well for themselves and alma mater.
George Grey and Phil Johnston
took third and fourth in the shot
put with throws of 47 feet 4 inches
and 40 feet 2 inches respectively.
They hardly can be blamed for plac
ing no higher, as Bob Kleckner of
S.F.U. won at 48 feet llVk inches and
Hank De√üerry of California was just
one-half inch behind.
Williams Crosses Sawdust
Phil Williams took a nice voyage
of 22 feet 6 inches across a sawdust
pit to get third in the broad-jump,
and Dan Lamont, ineligible fresh
man high-jumper, leaped into a tie
for third in his favorite event. Bud
Gordon, ex-Card trackster, put the
fair name of Stanford after one win
ner when he copped the highs from
Dean Stallings, present Indian
hurdler.
From a non-Stanford point of
view, the meet was distinctly Harry
Carterish in tone. The veteran
Olympic Club distance man, who
still thinks he can run with the best
of the youngsters and who still does
it, broke all existing Iron Man rec
ords when he won the mile, took
thirds in the 440 and the 880, and
was second in the one and one-half
mile steeplechase.
Lombardi Hurt
Leading Ralph Giberson last Fri
day in a 220 that Gibey finished in
21.7, Frank Lombardi cramped his
old bruised muscle and had to slow
down. Lombardi will run against
U.S.C., but it is doubtful if he will
be able to put that final push behind
his strides that means the precious
tenth of a second.
More news from the Delt hospital
reveals that Jack Brugman is up and
running gaily about. Brugman tried
out his sore leg a couple of times
last week, and he too should be able
to take a crack at Cromwell's boys.
Bill Werder, injured broad-jumper,
plans on working out today for the
first time since his troublesome
muscle became troublesome.
Herbert Gets Even
Cotto Herbert got even for some
of the beatings he has been taking
from Gus Meier when he defeated
the sophomore in a 24.6 low hurdle
flight on Friday. Incidentally, dop
ing the low hurdles in the Trojan
meet is harder than finding an un
qualified political statement, as both
Meier and Herbert may place and
then neither of them may do so.
In the highs, it looks as though
Meier will be one of the first three
men to finish, but which one?
ah, Mr. Templeton, you tell us.
