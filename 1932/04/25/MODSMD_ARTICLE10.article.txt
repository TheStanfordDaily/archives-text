### 
PARIS. April 24. (VP)—The leader
of the powerful radical Socialist op
position, Edounrd Herriot, brought
Franco-American relations into the
French election campaign today
when he declared that France should
tell this to the United States: "If
our affairs do not interest you, then
let us alone."
The former Premier and long-time
Mayor of Lyons was making an at
tack on Premier Andre Tardieu in
an address at Avignon, when he
brought the United States into the
campaign oratory. M. Herriot pro
tested against the Hoover mora
torium and asserted former Premier
Pierre Laval's visit to Washington
was unnecessary.
