# Neiderhauser Perfects New Super-Stop Watch
## 
### 
An invention expected to partially
supersede the stop watch for use in
i scientific and educational experi
ments has been perfected by C. 11.
Niederhauser, graduate student in
the School of Education, and will be
I put on the market by the Stanford
| University Press in a few weeks.
Known as the Stanford Time Re
corder, this instrument records the
| exact instant when an activity is
i started, its duration, what that activ
j ity is as differentiated from others,
and its place in a sequence of events.
I All this is done automatically and
1 requires no writing on the part of
the observer, as is necessary when a
J stop watch is used.
1 The advantages claimed for the

Time Recorder are that it is easier to
manipulate, more accurate, cheaper,
and enables the observer to give his
whole attention to watching the ex
periment. or activity without being
obliged to watch the time and record
data.
Dr. Walter R. Miles of the psy
chology department has made use of
the Time Recorder in experiments
both with humans and with animals
where formerly it was necessary to
employ a stop watch and to write
data in columns. He reports it as
being extremely satisfactory in that
it records the information auto
matically and makes it possible for
the experimenter to devote all his
time to making observations.
