Right Reverend James E. Freeman,
Bishop of Washington, D.C., spoke of
the challenge of the circumstances of

"Down through the ages," Bishop
Freeman said, "the man who has
risen above the circumstances which
surround him has been the man who
has put his confidence and assurance
in a Faith which never fails." Ap
plying the lesson to the present day.
Dr. Freeman stressed the need for
something beyond the material re
