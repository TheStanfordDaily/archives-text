# Gallery's Jeer For 'Romeo And Juliet' Converted To Cheer
## Audience Begins by Tossing Pennies, Ends Applauding Actors; Bailey, Converse, Lyons Scintillate In Masterly Helvenston Production 
### HARRISON FOSS 
|„N SPITE of the attempt by part of the audience to make a farce of one
of the most masterly productions ever attempted by the dramatic coun
cil, "Romeo and Juliet," as produced under the direction of Harold 11 c-1 -
venston last Friday night in the Assembly Ilall, will hold its own when
compared with other plays here. An audience that will arrive late, usurp
seats, and persistently interrupt the continuity of a play by tossing coins
on the stage or against the back wall of the theatre, doesn't deserve the

artistry of Harold Hclvenston, Dr.
Margery Bailey, Peg Randall Con
verse, and James Lyons.
Ushering Poor
There may be some excuse for
penny-tossing at the Big Game
Gaieties, but last Friday night a
more efficient ushering system
would have thrown such offenders
out of the auditorium, and the dra
matic council is to be sharply criti
cized for not providing such.
"Romeo and Juliet," as presented
here, is an example how on occasion
the amateur may outdo the profes
sional. This play has become the
victim of the star system in that
often the leading roles are magni
fied far out of proportion to the
rest, and scenes in which the stars
do not appear to advantage are left
out, spoiling the rhythm intended
by Shakespeare.
Dr. Bailey Stars
It would have been simple for
D . Margery Bailey in the comedy
role of Nurse to score a personal
triumph by over-acting. The result
would have been something good,
but out of proportion to the rest of
the play. Friday night the part of
the Nurse was done with fine re
straint and perfectly integrated, a
tribute, indeed, to Dr. Bailey the
actress.
The elegant costuming, the color
ful prologue, the short waits be
tween acts, the flexible background,
the realistic deaths, the fine ar
rangement of scenery for the tomb
and balcony scenes, as well as the
acting, were spoken for in the ova
tion at the final curtain, when the
actors were called again and again
to greet the audience. A well-done
curtain call adds considerably to
the finish of a production, and it was
deplorable that none had been re
hearsed for "Romeo and Juliet."
Converse Dynamic
Certainly Peg Randall Converse
should have had one call alone. Her
Juliet was a remarkable perform
ance. She made the difficult Shake
spearian language seem quite mod
ern, and carried every scent? in
which she appeared. Mrs. Converse's
work heretofore, while excellent,
never gave promise of the dynamic
Juliet seen last Friday night.
In some measure, James Lyons
was miscast as Romeo. His forte is
intensity, and it was at a disadvan
tage amid Ihe poetry of the love
scenes. Nevertheless, every moment
of his portrayal was more than ade
quate; if he had been acting with a
group of less distinction, his work
would have been outstanding. The
audience was probably responsible
for his self-consciousness in the
opening scenes.
Few Muffed Lines
Friar Laurence as played by Val
lejo Gantner gave dignity to the
tragedy, and although he muffed his
lines, Gantner scored a personal
success. James Sandoe is to be com
mended for attacking the most dif
ficult part in the play in the man
ner he did. By taking center stage
and encroaching on Romeo he was
able to give himself enough force to
make Mercutio convincing.
Space will not permit an adequate
discussion of the brilliant cast. It is
enough to say that the work of Rob
ert Brauns as the Nurse's servant,
Bob Cathcart as Tybalt, Craig
Thomas as Old Capulet, and George
Leavens as the Prince of Verona
deserves particular mention. June
Birchard as mother of Juliet was
made up to look too young to be
convincing and was 0110 of the weak
points of the production.
Technical Work Fine
Howard McCully as technical di
rector, and Lucy Brown as ward
robe mistress, were in many ways
more responsible than the actors for
the smoothness and distinction of
the show. The whole thing meant
untold hours of work on the part of
them and their colleagues.
The choice of "Romeo and Juliet"
was courageous on the part of Di
rector Hclvenston. Everyone who
really wanted to see Ihe play dur
ing the last two years has seen it,
and the plot is rather thin gruel.
Helvenston must have had great,
confidence in the ability and draw
ing power of his actors.

There may be some excuse for
penny-tossing at the Big Game
Gaieties, but last Friday night a
more efficient ushering system
would have thrown such offenders
out of the auditorium, and the dra
matic council is to be sharply criti
cized for not providing such.
"Romeo and Juliet," as presented
here, is an example how on occasion
the amateur may outdo the profes
sional. This play has become the
victim of the star system in that
often the leading roles are magni
fied far out of proportion to the
rest, and scenes in which the stars
do not appear to advantage are left
out, spoiling the rhythm intended
by Shakespeare.
Dr. Bailey Stars
It would have been simple for
D . Margery Bailey in the comedy
role of Nurse to score a personal
triumph by over-acting. The result
would have been something good,
but out of proportion to the rest of
the play. Friday night the part of
the Nurse was done with fine re
straint and perfectly integrated, a
tribute, indeed, to Dr. Bailey the
actress.
The elegant costuming, the color
ful prologue, the short waits be
tween acts, the flexible background,
the realistic deaths, the fine ar
rangement of scenery for the tomb
and balcony scenes, as well as the
acting, were spoken for in the ova
tion at the final curtain, when the
actors were called again and again
to greet the audience. A well-done
curtain call adds considerably to
the finish of a production, and it was
deplorable that none had been re
hearsed for "Romeo and Juliet."
Converse Dynamic
Certainly Peg Randall Converse
should have had one call alone. Her
Juliet was a remarkable perform
ance. She made the difficult Shake
spearian language seem quite mod
ern, and carried every scent? in
which she appeared. Mrs. Converse's
work heretofore, while excellent,
never gave promise of the dynamic
Juliet seen last Friday night.
In some measure, James Lyons
was miscast as Romeo. His forte is
intensity, and it was at a disadvan
tage amid Ihe poetry of the love
scenes. Nevertheless, every moment
of his portrayal was more than ade
quate; if he had been acting with a
group of less distinction, his work
would have been outstanding. The
audience was probably responsible
for his self-consciousness in the
opening scenes.
Few Muffed Lines
Friar Laurence as played by Val
lejo Gantner gave dignity to the
tragedy, and although he muffed his
lines, Gantner scored a personal
success. James Sandoe is to be com
mended for attacking the most dif
ficult part in the play in the man
ner he did. By taking center stage
and encroaching on Romeo he was
able to give himself enough force to
make Mercutio convincing.
Space will not permit an adequate
discussion of the brilliant cast. It is
enough to say that the work of Rob
ert Brauns as the Nurse's servant,
Bob Cathcart as Tybalt, Craig
Thomas as Old Capulet, and George
Leavens as the Prince of Verona
deserves particular mention. June
Birchard as mother of Juliet was
made up to look too young to be
convincing and was 0110 of the weak
points of the production.
Technical Work Fine
Howard McCully as technical di
rector, and Lucy Brown as ward
robe mistress, were in many ways
more responsible than the actors for
the smoothness and distinction of
the show. The whole thing meant
untold hours of work on the part of
them and their colleagues.
The choice of "Romeo and Juliet"
was courageous on the part of Di
rector Hclvenston. Everyone who
really wanted to see Ihe play dur
ing the last two years has seen it,
and the plot is rather thin gruel.
Helvenston must have had great,
confidence in the ability and draw
ing power of his actors.
|„N SPITE of the attempt by part of the audience to make a farce of one
of the most masterly productions ever attempted by the dramatic coun
cil, "Romeo and Juliet," as produced under the direction of Harold 11 c-1 -
venston last Friday night in the Assembly Ilall, will hold its own when
compared with other plays here. An audience that will arrive late, usurp
seats, and persistently interrupt the continuity of a play by tossing coins
on the stage or against the back wall of the theatre, doesn't deserve the

artistry of Harold Hclvenston, Dr.
Margery Bailey, Peg Randall Con
verse, and James Lyons.
