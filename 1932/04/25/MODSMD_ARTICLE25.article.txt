# CAMPUS THIEF GETS 10 YEARS IN PENITENTIARY
## Jackson, 21, Found Guilty Of Grand Theft At San Jose Court SENT TO SAN QUENTIN Admits Robbing Farm Of $800 In Confession 
### 
Admitting to having stolen over
$800 worth of cash and articles from
the Stanford campus, Charles Jack
son of Palo Alto, debonair, 21-year
old confirmed petty thief, was sen
tenced to serve from one to ten
years in San Quentin prison by
Judge R. R. Syer of San Jose last
Friday afternoon.
Jackson's trial and ultimate con
viction on a charge of grand theft
came after a five-hour grilling by
Gordon Davis and George Burns of
the Stanford police force and Chief
Edward Farrel of the Atherton po
lice force in the latter's office. Long
suspected of being responsible for a
large proportion of the many rob
beries that have marked this school
year, Jackson made his confession
when Farrel, Burns, and Davis
caught him up on minor inconsis
tencies in the lengthy cross-exami
nation.
Robbed Pi Phis
Certainly since last October and
probably much longer, Jackson has
been working the Stanford campus
with marked success. He was ap
prehended on only one occasion pre
vious to Friday's conviction, when
he was found guilty of robbing the
Pi Phi house last year and served
six months in the county jail.
Burns had been suspicious of
Jackson for many months, but was
unable to pin anything on him.
However, when Jackson was seen in
the men's locker room by a Stanford
student who found his wallet empty
and later was seen at Menlo Junior
College under the same circum
stances, Burns and Davis took him
into custody and finally got the self
confession.
Avoided Houses
Jackson's chief activity was in the
halls and the gym locker rooms, as
he found the fraternity houses too
suspicious for safe burglarizing. He
had spent, pawned, sold, or given
away everything he had stolen when
caught, with the exception of four
watches and a single suit of clothing.
It is extremely probable that Jack
son stole much more than the
amount stipulated above, as he
would not confess to anything not
listed in Burns's records and he was
not put through any third degree. II
is apparent from his smooth methods
and the awkwardness of some of the
jobs that have been pulled off at
Stanford that he is not Ihe only man
working the campus. '
