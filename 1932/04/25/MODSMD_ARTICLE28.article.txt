# CHEERS, BRONX AND OTHERWISE

As iki amount of editorial reviling and storming could
persuade the smart-alecks who threw pennies on the stage
dining the production of "Romeo and Juliet" last Friday
night that their actions were not in the best taste and quite
becoming a Stanford gentleman, let it be sulTicicnt to re
mark that all except the pennytossers were thoroughly
disgusted with this high school trick.
The actors should not take the actions of these Holly
wood collegians as a personal affront or criticism of their
work. They are the more to be commended by the excel
lent manner in which they carried on the performance in
spite of the disturbances.
However, one can hardly blame some students for car
rying a few pennies in their pockets when going to a
campus production of "Romeo and Juliet." Director Hel
venston may consider the pennies tossed at his choice of
the plav and not at the actors.
"Romeo and Juliet" is far from being one of Shake
speare's best plays and after cutting many of the original
lines, as was necessary for the university production, much
of the spice was gone. It is ditticult to put on and it was
only because of the ability of the actors that the play was a
success at all.
The numerous curtain-calls can be interpreted only as a
'tribute to the exceptional work of the artists. The play
itself as a selection for campus production, and Mr. Hel
venston, who chose it. got their tribute in the shower of
pennies and the Bronx cheer.
If Mr. llelvenston was delighted by the loud applause,
he might imagine the uproar had his talented actors been
cast in a vehicle of more general appeal, a play of such
attraction not having been produced on the campus this
year.
