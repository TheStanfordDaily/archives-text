Alto youth, convicted of grand theft, was given one to ten
years in the penitentiary for stealing clothes and money

If Charles Jackson, 21, is not yet fully convinced of his
mistake in looting Stanford living groups, he will have
plenty of time to think it over behind the iron bars of a
lonely prison cell in San Qucntin.
The confessions of this young man accounted for
in money and goods that has been lifted during the past
year. Much more has been stolen. "Hard times" has in
creased the frequency of thefts here, as elsewhere.
May the Jackson case variety of speedy apprehension,
swift conviction, and severe punishment continue until the
Farm is again safe for the "unlocked door" spirit that has
always prevailed at Stanford.
