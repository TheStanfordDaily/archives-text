# BAREFOOT CO-EDS SKIP DOWN ROW AS SPRING CALLS
## 
### 
The Stanford co-ed is losing
her sophistication with a speed
that is alarming to those who
would uphold the dignity of
the campus.
First she forgets her station
to the extent of playing jacks
on the Quad. Then followed
roller-skating and bicycle
peddling. And nowâ€”she goes
barefooted down the Row.
The call of Spring seems to
have been too much for these
back-to-naturites. Study and
shows were foregone for the
pleasure of skipping gaily
over lawns and rocks and cute
little worms.
The one concession to Stan
ford tradition is seen in the
fact that the nefarious deed
was done under the all-pro
tecting cover of tin* night.
