# FAIR HARVARD ON A SPREE
## 
### 
Life ill Ihe eastern colleges is one long puzzle to stu
dents in the western part of these I'nited Stales. Suppos
edly Ihe acme of collegiate sedateness, formality, and de
corum, the inmates of Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Columbia,
and the ollicrs break out every so often in a burst of wild
ness thai makes the diversions of the "rougher" Pacific
('.oast universities appear pale by comparison.
Students :il Harvard, stronghold of eastern conserva
tism, staged a riot last week which developed into a pitched
battle with police, tear bombs being necessary to quell Ihe
blue-blooded New Knglanders. A stolen bell clapper was
the only apparent cause for the excitement, yet Harvard
put on a tight that surpassed Stanford-California Axe and
bonfire raids. Xor is Ihis an isolated incident; similar
clashes with police are common occurrences both at Cam
bridge and New Haven, and no one appears to consider
lliem anything unusual.
How can this sort of unmannerly exuberance be recon
ciled with Ihe fact thai suils ;ire de rigeur in eastern class
rooms, ih;il formal dress means white lie and tail coal on
mosl eastern campi, that exclusive prep schools furnish a
majority of Ihe entering undergraduates?
Il is a curious situation, one not easy to comprehend at
Ibis distance. However, a moral can perhaps be drawn
Irom it. Local residents, theatre proprietors, and admin
istration officials might give heed lo Ihe ways of other col
leges and be thankful that Ihe sons of Ihe Cardinal are
relatively restrained in their search for excitement. The
annual Irosh pajaniarino with its inevitable wind-up al Ihe
Palv show houses appears rather innocuous beside Ihe re
curring affrays at Harvard.
