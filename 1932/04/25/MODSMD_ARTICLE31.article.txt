# BULL SESSION
## "... AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE" 
### 
The Old Gray Mare ain't what she
used to be. That, however, should
not make her ('eel self conscious in
the least. Btcause, nothing is what
it used to be. In fact, conditions are
in such a state of flux that in a
world of overproduction, the great
est single example of overproduc
tion is the host of opinions on just
what conditions really are. It is
this uncertainty that is making
everything so hard for the college
student about to launch, or more
probably submerge, himself in the
sea of life.
Innumerable charts, more lectures,
and still more statements by many
people to the tune of "If I could
only have gone to college—" re
sulted in crowding the educational
mills. This was not due to a sudden
craving for the liberal arts. No
rennaisance swept the land causing,
like in Florence, even the garbage
collectors to sing Dante's love songs
to greasy kitchen maids. No, the
great quest for the "A. B." came
about because the questers were
convinced that a diploma was a
certain short cut to the higher
brackets of the income tax schedule.
But now, that rumor has been ef
fectively squelched. College grad
uates are finding jobs like ghosts—
easy to talk about but hard to mat
erialize. In a world when many
concerns are drowning in a sea of
red ink, where the only solid thing
in sight is the jagged reef of bank
ruptcy—the graduate doesn't even
get a chance to lose a job. Some
thing must be done; and so college

[students are going in for more ad
j vanced degrees—the more optimis
; tic take the M. A. —the more pessi
mistic the Ph. D. It all depends
| how many years you think the de
pression will last.
The worst thing is the difficulty
j in getting sound advice on what to
; do; because few people know the
[situation; and fewer talk about it.
1 Tomorrow morning, however, the
j "Farm" gets a rare crack at some
j real information on what is and
' what to do about it. A woman by
; the name of Dr. Gilbreth will speak
, on "Guidance in a Changing World"
I in the all-University assembly. She
! has enough color and zip about her
i to have been picked up by the Sun
day supplements; and enough pres
tige to rate the chairmanship of the
Woman's Division of Hoover's Un
! employment Committee. That is
j one rare combination and "If by
I their fruits you shall know them",
this talk should be balm to troubled
I senior souls.
i To the seniors, graduation is not
a distant dream—or a vague possi
| bility. They will all be present to
; morrow. But the lower classmen
! shouldn't feel this is no concern 'of
; theirs. It hardly seems any time
i since I too was pitying poor grad
uates facing the future; now I in
dulge in self-pity. It's more apropos.
If lower classmen could realize that
this speaker (even though she is a
I woman and an engineer) may ob
viate a lot of worrying in a year or
i so, they too would jam the As-
I sembly hall tomorrow morning.
