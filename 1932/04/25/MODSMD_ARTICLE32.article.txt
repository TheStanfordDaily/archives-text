HOUGHS' CONDUCT lIIT
The Editor, Sir:
There were elements to make up
a fine production of "Romeo and
Juliet" in the Assembly Hall Friday
evening, and. t enjoyed bits of Mer
cutio's, Tybalt's, and the Nurse's
parts as much as anything I have
ever seen. Scenery, also, was lovely,
and the costumes were gorgeous.
But the young boors who amused
themselves by bedaubing a work
of art with their ugly humor may
have the satisfaction of knowing
that they turned the evening into a
horrible experience for at least one
member of the audience. Stanford
roughs may be all right in their
place, wherever that is; and the
beauty of such a production (as this
was meant to be) is certainly to be
desired and sought for; but the
combination is unendurable. As a
fairly regular attendant at Stanford
plays for the last 10 years or more,
I hereby testify that I shall stay
away, and advise my friends to stay
away, until there is ample assurance
that an unpleasant experience will
not be repeated. And I feel sure
that this intention is fairly general
among members of last night's audi
ence.
No one wants his feelings shat
tered and made fun of (even when
it may be justified); but that was
exactly the result when those who
acted in, or listened to, the marvel
ous story of "a pair of star-crossed
lovers" were forced to listen, also,
to penny-throwing, guffaws, hisses,
and sounds of those who stick their
fingers in their mouths, like babies,
and draw them out again with a
sucking pop. How Mrs. Converse
and Mr. Lyons were able to con
tinue so bravely as they did is more
than I can imagine; and it is certain
that their performance fell far be
low the level which they might have
attained before more sympathetic
listeners. Sympathy among the lis
teners, however, was nearly impos
sible, and there was nothing to do
but to look on at the destruction of
a beautiful play, and deplore the
useless waste.
Managers of the Stanford produc
tions have only themselves to blame.
Such rowdyism has been increasing
steadily at each performance this
year, and it speaks for simple care
lessness that it should reach objec

tionable proportions. Surely the
remedy is simple, too; if necessary
do away with the "roughs' seats."
Hoodlums are doubtless not only
vulgar but cheap, and if asked to
pay for regular reserved seats, they
will (it is to be devoutly hoped) stay
away.
Very truly yours,
D. K. Alden
