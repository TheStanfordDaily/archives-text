# ANOTHER COMPLAINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I wish to express my opinion con
cerning the childish behavior of a
portion of the audience at the pro
duction of "Romeo and Juliet" last
Friday night. Cat-calls, loud smacks
when kissing took place on the
stage, horse-laughs, clapping when
the audience had to wait a few min
utes between scenes, and throwing
pennies on the stage became a dis
tinct nuisance to the major portion
of those attending the play and
surely bothered the players. Such
business is distinctly small-town and
high-school stuff and is a disgrace
to Stanford.
When Jean Jamison was doing her
best with a bad song in the "Foot
ball Gaieties" last fall she was bom
barded with pennies, when Governor
Rolph attended the boxing matches
last winter the same business took
place; but probably the worst case
of this kind was during the balcony
scene of Friday night's performance.
Any normal person would have been
impressed with the quality of this
scene—the lines, acting, and setting
were probably the finest combina
tion ever presented on a Stanford
stage—but a few morons spoiled the
act by their pennies. There was
even one participant sitting in the
rear of the theatre, thus prevented
from throwing anything on the
stage, who dropped money on the
floor with great regularity.
The type of person who indulges
in this sport is usually one who
never does anything himself but
merely gives the bird to everyone
trying to do something. It is the
same sort of wise guy that boos at
football games and knows how to
play football better than the varsity
squad is doing it.
No one is forced to attend a play
at Stanford and when he does wan
der into a performance he should
have enough manners to behave like

a decent person rather than a high
' school freshman. I am sure that the
1 director and actors of campus plays
have no desire to be taken too seri
ously but they surely expect normal
courtesy. —Bob Clarke
