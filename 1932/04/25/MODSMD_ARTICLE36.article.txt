j Beloved Countrymen:
Now is the time for all good men j
i and true to come to the aid of the1
| party. God save the Emperor. A
stitch in time saves nine. Never!
i put off till tomorrow what should
! have been done yesterday. Where >
{ cobwebs grow a rolling stone gathers i
Ino moss. Roses are red, violets are j
i blue and you can get awful drunk :
j on a bottle of vanilla extract cros- j
sing the China Sea.
Before we tell you about the i
j beautiful new scenes we're happen- [
j ing on every little while, now, we |
' want you to sit down and memorize j
: this prize-winning Siamese Song 1
; well enough to say it for us when we !
j get home.

A prince wooed a princess of j
Siam
Quolli she, to -this fair son of
Priam,
"If you kiss me, of course, |
You must do it by force—
But Lord knows, you're strong
er than I am!"
_ .
It is a very backward and j
j ing nation, as you can see. Siam- j
I ese shyness is matched only by that |
| of 500 Stanford maidens at a de- i
I pi'ession dance.
j The world misunderstands about •
j this Siamese twin business. We ;
! spent most of the time in Siam look- j
l ing for that peculiar variety of twin, |
| but didn't see any. Once more on |
i board ship, though, we've been see- '
j ing a lot of things doubling and!
| tripling up on us. It may be the j
! climate, but they might just as well ;
!be Siamese as anything else. Ho !
; hum.
j j
i
| We have made a good friend
of the sextant, though. .You I
know, that is the guy which
buries you at sea. .1 only hope
he can tell the difference be
tween being dead and being
just out on your feet—or think
ing hard.
We're anxious to reach China, j
; where things are happening fast, i
| Didn't care so much for Japan, on j
j account of it is just like the tea ;
( sets picture it, in spots, and other !
' places like Fifth and Mission in S.F. |

We looked hard for a wandering i
I minstrel, but didn't find any, and
j Madame Butterfly is spending the
; season on the Riviera. Such dis- 1
j appointments! Under the Mikado !
i though there is a very interesting j
' little officer callcd the "shotgun".
! V/e wanted to see more of him but ;
jit seems there wasn't any more. j
j (heh!)
Here comes another tidal wave— !
; or maybe it is a salvo of greetings j
I from the many many armies already
! trying to get the upper hand in j
j China. Just wait till we get there!;
j We'll show 'em!—orientally, W.
