With baseball just a memory,
•xccpt for a probable post-sea
<in contest with a team from
he American Hospital in Tokio,
orm-time next month, fans are
till puzzled over the way Stanf
ord's defending champions
h-opped from first to a tie for
ourlh this year.
«Vhcn you consider that the Red
rls lost the services of Dykes
inston, one of the best third-base
n seen in the conference in years,
n Johnson, probably the best
>spcctive hurler the Farm has
■r had, Captain Johnnie Hunken,
ose playing and fire led the team
its first championship since the
vers regime, Spud Hardy, peppy
;t-saeker, and Art Miller, varsity
cher, it is little wonder that
ach Wolter had trouble in build
a repeater.
I( has often been said that a
hatnpionship team is the one
iuit wins all its one-run games,
■iince Stanford lost six of its
tine defeates by a lone tally, it
s obvious that it does not come
inder this category. But what
nost of (he hot-stove league
nemhers seem (o forget is that
t takes experience as well as
uinch (o take the close ones,
v'lost of the season Stanford
iresented three or four and
ometimes five sophomores in its
ine-up. This makes (he future
afcr, l»u( it doesn't help the
present much, as the season
howed.
Another tiling that hasn't helped
the fact that the relief pitchers
'ed to come through until near
end of the race, when it was
late. The difference between one
y good pitcher and fair relief
rlers, and one good chucker and
jbtful relief pitching, is about
ee defeats, judged by the late
tented conference battle.
f the aforementioned dyed-in
-wool citizens will also remem

And that's all there is to it. How

Wolter is going to have a good

ents, depression, and the fac-
Ity ax. lie has two youngsters

recognition on the Farm. De

opposition off the field with
fling regularity this spring.
The only reason that they
on't have handicaps for the
arsity players, as nearly as we
; m find out, is that it costs too
inch to have the aristocrats
ho figure out polo handicaps
(» into executive session over
'.ere plebeians like Stanford
arsity players. And so the poor

cninsula just for fun. have to
ive the Cards handicaps and
ion take (heir beatings.
