# Final Win Gives Cards .500 Season Ball Average
## STANFORD DOWNS S. F. U. OUTFIT 9-6 TO ANNEX SERIES Indians On Scoring Spree In First Inning To Take Five-Run Lead 
### Bob Wade 
Piling up six runs in (he first in
-1 ning, two more in the fifth, arid one
in the eighth, Stanford's varsity
baseball team closed the season with
an average of .500 by whipping the
| Dons from the University of San
I Francisco 9-6 to take the annual
! series Saturday on the Sunken Dia
i mond.
Ray O'Day, starting his final game
| for the visitors, seemed to have left
! his control at home, and by the
! time that Coach Gene Valla rushed
i Roy Huntley to the rescue, the
j Tribe was far out in front.
Dons Threaten
The closest that the Dons could
] get to the ex-champions was when
: they pulled up to (5-5 in their half
! of the fifth. The Indians got to work
i in the same inning, however, and
I matched the visitors with a pair of
tallies to put the game on ice.
The three graduating seniors who
| played in their last intercollegiate
| game for Stanford Saturday con
i tributed two of the Indians' seven
j hits and performed in the field
j without an error. Gory Campbell
j finished up with a triple in five
I attempts, while Vince Philippi, the
! league's leading slugger, collected
' one for four. Captain Rintala went
j hitless.
The final line-up that took the
field gave promise of a better team
j for next season, presenting five
| sophomores, three of them in the
i infield and one on the mound.
Sophomores Improve
Art Hearn played the entire game
at first base, getting one hit in two
times at bat and turning in a good
performance at the initial sack. Dick
J Miles, who finished the season in
right field, finally hit his stride, and
contributed a triple to the first-in
ning scoring spree.
Stan Anderson had one of his few
bad days this year, but managed to
tighten up in the pinches and limit
ed the Dons to seven hits. The big
j sophomore whiffed six of the bat
| ters that faced him and walked the
j same number, which is about twice
j the usual total that rate free passes
, to first when he is on the mound,
j Jim Massey caught the entire nine
innings in place of the injured
Livermore, and except for a couple
of passed balls, turned in his best
game.
1933 Infield Stronger
Coach Wolter will have both his
i varsity catchers back next year.
| With the addition of Gordy Malla
j tratt from this year's freshman out
j fit, and Bill Triplett, who substituted
| for Delmas, the infield should be
j even stronger for the 1933 season,
j In the outfield Coach Wolter will
I have to replace Captain Rudy Rin
j tala and Gord Campbell, but with
j Miles, Irsfeld, Newman, and Lefty
j Goldmann to pick from the outer
j garden should be as strong on the
field as it has been this year.
Team Needs Slugger
The only thing that is bothering
I Wolter at present is the question
i of hitting. Mallatratt is one of the
| best "naturals" seen around here in
: some time. Delmas should be vastly
| improved by next season. Hearn and
: Miles give promise of becoming de
-1 pendable sluggers. Anderson is prob
ably the hardest hitting pitcher in
the conference. Trautman can hit if
! he stays away from the golf team
long enough to get his batting eye.
I Irsfeld has a good eye at the plate,
and Goldmann will hang on to his
lead-off position if he returns to the
! Farm.
With this material to build on,
Stanford fans can expect to see their
team offer the Trojans, who took
i the title by defeating U.C.L.A. Sat
i urday, plenty of trouble when they
! try to repeat next year.
