# CARDINAL MACHINE LACKS EXPERIENCE
## Four Teams Fail To Score In Practice Games 
### Maurice Rapf 
By Maurice Rapf

The fact that some five months re
main before the opening of the 1932 j
football season somewhat cheered
members of the Stanford coaching j
staff as they watched various grid
combinations go through an unin
spired scrimmage game last Friday
afternoon on the practice field.
It was apparent that all the avail- !
able time between now and next j
fall will be necessary before the de
velopment of a satisfactory eleven ;
will be completed. It isn't a question 1
of materialâ€”there's plenty of it. i
What is needed now is plenty of j
time to work over the more intri- '
cate plays, and constant drilling in ,
fundamentals.
100 Spectators
About 100 chilled spectators j
turned out to watch Friday's festivi- 1
ties, but those who expected to see
anything sensational in the way of
football were sorely disappointed. |
Two sets of teams, the reds and j
greens, and the blues and yellows, I
held the center of the gridiron for !
over an hour, but couidn't do any- j
thing in the way of scoring. No j
team threatened.
Tommy Lambert, of the Reds,
provided the thrill of the afternoon
when he took a pass behind the
line from Jack Hillman, galloped
thirty yards down the field, and was
apparently off to a touchdown when ,
Sanderson brought him down.
New Rules
The men seemed fairly well drilled
in the new rules, although the
blockers and tacklers frequently left
their feet. On several occasions,
Jack Hillman could have gotten up
for long runs except for the new
rules which call a man down when
any part of his body other than
hands or feet touch the ground.
The Red squad had Tod and
Buchanan, ends, Lettunich and Hoi- ;
werdar, tackles, Kite and Corbus, I
guards, Albertson, center, Maentz
and Lambert, halves, Hillman, full,
and Walker calling signals.
On the Greens were Bates, cen
ter, Morgan and Gould, guards,
Rogers and Prelsnik, tackles, Philip
pi and Gillespie, ends, Spencer and
Sanderson, halves, Moore, quarter,
and Hancock at fullback.
Coach Warner, his staff, and cer
tain members of the team went to
Santa Clara Saturday where the
Broncos, under Clipper Smith, held
their yearly football roundup.

Twenty-eight per cent of the co
; eds in Indiana university are work
ing their own way through college.
