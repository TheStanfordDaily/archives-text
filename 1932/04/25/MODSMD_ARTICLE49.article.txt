# WEEK'S PLAY WILL FISH ROUND I IN INTRAMURAL BALL
## Breakers Stand Out Among League-Ball Squads; 4 Games Today 
### 
TODAY'S GAMES
Phi Sigma Kappa vs. El Campo
on intramural field
Alpha Delta Phi vs. Japanese I
Club on frosh ball diamond
Theta Xi vs. Chi Psi on frosh
football field
Zeta Psi vs. Beta Theta Pi on
Greys' football field

Entering the last quarter of the
first round of mural ball play today,
the Alpha Delta Phi nine will meet
the Japanese Club while the Phi
Sigma Kappa outfit will face the
El Campo squad in the League IV
schedule of the hard ball divisions.
Theta Xi and Chi Psi, and Zeta Psi
and Beta ball clubs will be on deck
for the indoor league games.
Last week's progress in the mural
play placed the Breakers' hard ball
team as perhaps the strongest bid-
der for the mural championship.
Close in the ratings came El Toro
and Sigma Chi.
The indoor league games offered a
different aspect on the section cham-
pionship. As far as scores were con-
cerned, Los Arcos came forward as
one of the strong contenders for the
title. The greater number of the
soft ball competitions ended in fast,
close games. Phi Gamma Delta,
Alpha Tau Omega, Kappa Alpha,
and Sequoia II won games in the
indoor division.
Tomorrow sees the opening of the
second round of mural ball play.
Two of the hard ball games will be
played on the sunken varsity dia-
mond. The official league castings
appear below. BB signifies baseball
diamond, while FB indicates one of
the football fields.

TODAY'S GAMES
Phi Sigma Kappa vs. El Campo
on intramural field
Alpha Delta Phi vs. Japanese I
Club on frosh ball diamond
Theta Xi vs. Chi Psi on frosh
football field
Zeta Psi vs. Beta Theta Pi on
Greys' football field

Entering the last quarter of the
first round of mural ball play today,
the Alpha Delta Phi nine will meet
the Japanese Club while the Phi
Sigma Kappa outfit will face the
El Campo squad in the League IV
schedule of the hard ball divisions.
Theta Xi and Chi Psi, and Zeta Psi
and Beta ball clubs will be on deck
for the indoor league games.
Last week's progress in the mural
play placed the Breakers' hard ball
team as perhaps the strongest bid-
der for the mural championship.
Close in the ratings came El Toro
and Sigma Chi.
The indoor league games offered a
different aspect on the section cham-
pionship. As far as scores were con-
cerned, Los Arcos came forward as
one of the strong contenders for the
title. The greater number of the
soft ball competitions ended in fast,
close games. Phi Gamma Delta,
Alpha Tau Omega, Kappa Alpha,
and Sequoia II won games in the
indoor division.
Tomorrow sees the opening of the
second round of mural ball play.
Two of the hard ball games will be
played on the sunken varsity dia-
mond. The official league castings
appear below. BB signifies baseball
diamond, while FB indicates one of
the football fields.
