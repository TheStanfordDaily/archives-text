Dr. Ralph H. McKee makes diamonds in his laboratory at Columbia
university. Here he is demonstrating the new process. Although not
large enough for use in jewelry, the stones are more than 10 times the
size of those produced in 1893 by a French chemist. Dr. McKee uses
an oven in which tremendous heat and pressure combine to form the
jewels.
