Coach Ray Daughters of the Washington Athletic Club has fixed up a pace-setter to aid Helene
Madison in her training for the pre-Olympic tryouts. Here we see the champion mermaid in the Seattle
club's pool racing against the device which consists of a line stretched the length of the course with
flag attached. The banner flies directly over the swimmer and operated at any speed by the coach.
