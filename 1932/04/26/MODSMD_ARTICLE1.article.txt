# S. G. TRACKMEN MAINTAIN ODDS AGAINST INDIANS
## Fighting Chance Given To Cards To Beat Southern Horde Saturday STANFORD OUTCLASSED "If" Big Word On Horizon As Big Meet Nears 
### 
Outclassed but not beaten. That I
sums up Stanford's chances for a |
much desired but nearly impossible
victory over Dean Cromwell's boys
in what appeared a month ago to be
the track battle of the ages between j
the Palo Alto Indian and the Los \
Angeles Trojan.
If Captain Alvin Rabies, his j
brother Les, and Frank Lombardi j
were in tip-top condition and if j
hurdlers Payne, Welsh, Bills, Carls, j
and Paul of U.S.C. signed pledges
to trip over one of the barriers that
bar a hurdler's way to the tape, the 1
Farm spikemen would still have to
give the Trojans odds. As it is, ,
Stanford has a fighting chance, but ,
what a fight it will have to be!
Les Hables, who is in far from !
speedy shape, will be missed most I
as he would be good for eight
points if able to run at his best. ;
Les will run Saturday, but it is i
doubtful if he will be able to place, j
Hables' mental condition is perfect, ;
and if his physical shape is as good
in dVen one race, the whole meet ,
will be different.
Trojans Have Sweep
As it is, comparative times give '
the Trojans a sweep in the 220 and
the first two places in the century. [
A second for Ralph Giberson in the
100 ranks as one of the Cards' out- j
side chances, and Frank Lombardi j
may be able to hold up in the fur- i
long and surprise with welcome I
points.
Captain Ike would be good for a j
possible second and a sure third in j
ihe 440, but he will run only the ;
relay because of his recent illness. :
Paul Nash is the boy who will have !
to defeat a couple of fine S.C. quar- I
ter-milers to give Stanford that j
third place point.
Hurdles Win Possible
Two second places in the hurdles |
is giving Gus Meier the benefit of
the doubt, and yet on the other'
hand a falling Trojan or an inspired
race and Meier could break the tape !
in either race. As Bill Ellington said j
yesterday, "if Stanford has a j
chance, it will be because of upsets j
in the hurdles," and he ranks Cotto !
Herbert as well as Meier among the i
possible "upsetters."
The broad-jump is another event
in which Stanford's chances are j
slim but exist. Dope gives the Tro- j
jans all three places, but Bill Wer
der and Wally Butler do not. If ,
either of these men crashes through !
with a second place and if the rest '
of the Indians also stay ahead of
the favored Trojans, the relay may j
decide the meet after all.
Saturday's quartet will include
Ike Hables, Eastman, Nash, and
Frank Fullen wider. Hables and
Fullenwider will be fresh, so that
the Cards should garner five points j
here.
Pole-Vault Uncertain
In the pole-vault, Bill Miller has '
a better chance to tie Mr. Graber !
of U.S.C. than Mr. Graber of U.S.C.
realizes. If Miller can do so, and if
Bert DeGroot or Ned Johns or botli \
of them can beat Schenlos out of j
third, the Cards will again have
come through.
| The rest of the events are more
certain, with the exception of the I
mile in which Jim Ferric may take j
Clif Halstead, and Al Storms should !
get a third. But it will take light j
and then some to down those Tro- j
jans.
Insisting that he is a miler after >
all, Big Ben Eastman ran three laps j
yesterday in the remarkable time of !
three minutes and eight seconds. If
Ben had kept on and negotiated his
last lap in only 70 seconds, his time
for a full mile would have been ;
4:18. However, Eastman will con- :
fine his efforts in Saturday's U.S.C. .
meet at Los Angeles to the 410, the
880, and the relay.

Saturday's quartet will include
Ike Hables, Eastman, Nash, and
Frank Fullen wider. Hables and
Fullenwider will be fresh, so that
the Cards should garner five points j
here.
Pole-Vault Uncertain
In the pole-vault, Bill Miller has '
a better chance to tie Mr. Graber !
of U.S.C. than Mr. Graber of U.S.C.
realizes. If Miller can do so, and if
Bert DeGroot or Ned Johns or botli \
of them can beat Schenlos out of j
third, the Cards will again have
come through.
| The rest of the events are more
certain, with the exception of the I
mile in which Jim Ferric may take j
Clif Halstead, and Al Storms should !
get a third. But it will take light j
and then some to down those Tro- j
jans.
Insisting that he is a miler after >
all, Big Ben Eastman ran three laps j
yesterday in the remarkable time of !
three minutes and eight seconds. If
Ben had kept on and negotiated his
last lap in only 70 seconds, his time
for a full mile would have been ;
4:18. However, Eastman will con- :
fine his efforts in Saturday's U.S.C. .
meet at Los Angeles to the 410, the
880, and the relay.
Outclassed but not beaten. That I
sums up Stanford's chances for a |
much desired but nearly impossible
victory over Dean Cromwell's boys
in what appeared a month ago to be
the track battle of the ages between j
the Palo Alto Indian and the Los \
Angeles Trojan.
If Captain Alvin Rabies, his j
brother Les, and Frank Lombardi j
were in tip-top condition and if j
hurdlers Payne, Welsh, Bills, Carls, j
and Paul of U.S.C. signed pledges
to trip over one of the barriers that
bar a hurdler's way to the tape, the 1
Farm spikemen would still have to
give the Trojans odds. As it is, ,
Stanford has a fighting chance, but ,
what a fight it will have to be!
Les Hables, who is in far from !
speedy shape, will be missed most I
as he would be good for eight
points if able to run at his best. ;
Les will run Saturday, but it is i
doubtful if he will be able to place, j
Hables' mental condition is perfect, ;
and if his physical shape is as good
in dVen one race, the whole meet ,
will be different.
Trojans Have Sweep
As it is, comparative times give '
the Trojans a sweep in the 220 and
the first two places in the century. [
A second for Ralph Giberson in the
100 ranks as one of the Cards' out- j
side chances, and Frank Lombardi j
may be able to hold up in the fur- i
long and surprise with welcome I
points.
Captain Ike would be good for a j
possible second and a sure third in j
ihe 440, but he will run only the ;
relay because of his recent illness. :
Paul Nash is the boy who will have !
to defeat a couple of fine S.C. quar- I
ter-milers to give Stanford that j
third place point.
Hurdles Win Possible
Two second places in the hurdles |
is giving Gus Meier the benefit of
the doubt, and yet on the other'
hand a falling Trojan or an inspired
race and Meier could break the tape !
in either race. As Bill Ellington said j
yesterday, "if Stanford has a j
chance, it will be because of upsets j
in the hurdles," and he ranks Cotto !
Herbert as well as Meier among the i
possible "upsetters."
The broad-jump is another event
in which Stanford's chances are j
slim but exist. Dope gives the Tro- j
jans all three places, but Bill Wer
der and Wally Butler do not. If ,
either of these men crashes through !
with a second place and if the rest '
of the Indians also stay ahead of
the favored Trojans, the relay may j
decide the meet after all.
