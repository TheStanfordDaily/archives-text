# CLUB ROOM SHUT SO FIREMEN QUIT
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, April 25. i/IV â€¢
If a fire breaks out in Llanerch, a
suburb, it's just too bad for the
Llanerch volunteer firemen are on
strike and the fire house is closed.
The strike followed enforcement
of an old rule prohibiting tin? use
of the fire house club rooms after
midnight. Thirteen fire fighters re
signed and the rest refused to act.
