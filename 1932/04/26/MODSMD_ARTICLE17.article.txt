# STUDENTS MASS TO AID CHINESE
## Ming Hua Wei, U.C. Man, Faces China Execution 
### 
Over at Berkeley, at the Univer-
I sity of California, a Chinese student
)is facing deportation and death in
j his native land.
| He is Ming Hua Wei, a student
'whose ihesis, "History of Commun
ism in China," was called a valuable
| contribution to science by profes-
I sors at U.C., says the Daily Cali-
I fornian.
| The matter of deportation will
i probably carry with it the execu-
I tion of Wei if he is taken back to
! his native country. His researches
I into the field of Chinese communism
! have been termed dangerous by au
j thorities in China.
j Final appeals to raise an emer
i gency fund of $250 to send Wei away
on a long trip, preferably the op
posite direction of China, where he
can continue his studies in Germany,
j were being made last Friday at a
j University meeting held at Har
| mon Gymnasium.
