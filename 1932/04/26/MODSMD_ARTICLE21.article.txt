# APPEAL OPENS MONDAY TO AID FARM CHARITY
## Annual Appeal Will Benefit Convalescent Waifs At Farm Home 
### 
Stanford's annual Convalescent
Home appeal, the proceeds of which
arc donated by Stanford students
for the care and support of some
GO or 70 children of poor health, is
scheduled to commence its three
days of feverish activity next Mon
day.
The historic home, occupying 26
acres of the original Stanford home
site, is an entirely independent or
ganization for charitable and educa
tional purposes. It provides nursing,
care, medical service, and instruc
tion for convalescent children who
come from the bay counties.
Yearly Appeal
In furtherance of this plan, an
annual appeal is made to students
only, whose subscriptions contribute
to the maintenance of the children
in the home. There is never an
empty bed, according to records,
and there is always a waiting list
of needy waifs.
Cases under treatment at the
present time include upper respira
tory infections, sinuses, colds, and
similar ailments. Sinus trouble, if
not treated in time for young chil
dren, often leads to more serious
complications, according to authori
ties.

Faber Directs

Dr. Harold K. Faber, director of
the Shrine Hospital for Crippled
Children in San Francisco, is also
in charge of the Stanford Home,
which is in reality a testing-ground
for the more serious cases sent to
the former. If the home should be
forced to close for any financial
reasons, not only would its present
70 young patients be left without
adequate care, but about 200 appli
cants would be deprived of future
aid.
