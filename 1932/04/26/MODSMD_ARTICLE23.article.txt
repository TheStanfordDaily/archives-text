### 
The new radio transmitter built
by two graduate students of the
Radio Club was put into actual use
over the week-end.
Results of sending and receiving
brought satisfactory results. The
farthest point received thus far in
the East was New Rochelle, New
York. From the Eastern stations the
operators could be heard "working"
the South American countries of
Paraguay and Uruguay. However, it
was impossible for the Stanford
transmitter to get in actual com
munication with these South Amer
ican countries.
Anyone desiring to send messages
to the Middle West or to the East
may send their communications to
Kotecki of the Radio Club.
