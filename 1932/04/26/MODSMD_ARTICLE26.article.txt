# Solons War to Block Federal Wage Cut Bill
## Factional Chiefs Plan to Unite Forces in Desperate Attempt to Stop Drive of Party Leaders To Secure Passage of Measure 
### 
lI7ASHINGTON, April 2!>. (/Pi —Under an unusual procedure and in the
face of hitter factional opposition, party leaders w ill seek Wednesday
to force through the House the $200,0(10,000 omnihus retrenchment bill as
a rider of the $20,000,000 legislative supply measure.
Party lines bejgan breaking up today as leaders of the anti-federal wage
cut movement began to form a coalition in a desperate effort to block the
drive of party chieftains for procedure they hope will secure passage of
the economy measure virtually intact. The success of the huge retrench
ment bill depends largely on whether the plan approved today by the

• liules Committee is adopted by the
' House.
This would limit general debate
| to one hour, permit the offering of
j not more than four amendments to
j each of the bill's ten titles, and re
j strict discussion of amendments to
• ten minutes for each proposed
I change.
Plan Big Push
Should the opposition defeat this
I procedure, the entire bill would be
i thrown open to unlimited amend
i ment.
Factional leaders plan to unite
i their divergent forces for a big push
i against the proposal. Representative
. La Guardia of New York, Repub-
I lican Independent, served notice
; that both Republican and Demo
cratic opponents would join in
] "voting it down."
Representative Blayton, Texas,
| and the influential Tammany dele
! gat ion from New York, expect to
' join in the battle against the bill's
1 eleven pet- cent federal wage cut
i proposition and the Hoover fur
■ i lough without pay proposal to be
| offered as a substitute.
"We Want Action"
| The economy committee displayed
a wide division of opinion before
the rules committee on how best to
: submit the bill for House considera
i tion. At the urgent plea of Chair
j man McDuffie the strict procedure
| was finally approved.
'"We want action rather than de-
I lay," McDuffie said. "The only way
we can get action by the Senate
this session on the Economy Bill is
by attaching it to the Legislative
. Appropriation Bill."
McDuffie delayed until late in the
day introduction of the measure in
order that several minor changes
might be made. He expects to file
r! a formal report on it before mid
night Tuesday.

] "voting it down."
Representative Blayton, Texas,
| and the influential Tammany dele
! gat ion from New York, expect to
' join in the battle against the bill's
1 eleven pet- cent federal wage cut
i proposition and the Hoover fur
■ i lough without pay proposal to be
| offered as a substitute.
"We Want Action"
| The economy committee displayed
a wide division of opinion before
the rules committee on how best to
: submit the bill for House considera
i tion. At the urgent plea of Chair
j man McDuffie the strict procedure
| was finally approved.
'"We want action rather than de-
I lay," McDuffie said. "The only way
we can get action by the Senate
this session on the Economy Bill is
by attaching it to the Legislative
. Appropriation Bill."
McDuffie delayed until late in the
day introduction of the measure in
order that several minor changes
might be made. He expects to file
r! a formal report on it before mid
night Tuesday.
