# UNIVERSITY POLITICS
## 
### 
One of the Invest contrasts between Stanford and the
other ('.oast universities is to be found in the conduct of
student politics. This is particularly noticeable at the pres
ent time, when major elections are approaching on all
cam pi.
At I'.S.C. rival factions are holding mass meetings, ral
lies, smokers, and resorting to all the other time-honored
means of vole getting. Likewise, up at Oregon the big shots
are lining up their tickets and oiling their machines with
a view to obtaining a dominant position for themselves and
their friends.
Compare this condition, which is typical of DO per cent
of western colleges, with the situation here. On the Farm
there is a certain amount of quiet campaigning; friends of
aspirants to olliee put in a little work on the side, but a
publicly organized machine, having .as its main purpose
the election of a certain group, would probably receive a
gentle bird and lose more votes for its candidates than il
gained. The vast majority of students are but slightly con
cerned with the outcome of political struggles, as is proven
by the small percentage which goes to the polls on election
day.
Whether this is something to be proud of is another
question. Stanford gains by being free from cliques, unless
the rather nebulous Hall-Row schism can be considered as
forming such groups, and il also gains in dignity. On the
other hand, i! is often said that students here have no way
of making decisions except on a basis of personal likings.
There are i â€¢ issues; candidates have no platforms and take
110 stands on matters of campus government.
This weakness might be remedied under a more defi
nitely organized political system, or it might not. National
party platforms give no basis for sound voting, and supcr
iicial observation indicates that the same thing is true in
the university campaigns.
With our restrained tradition, it is possible that Stan
ford could introduce a more constructive plan if some
enterprising politician wanted to make the effort. Il would
be interesting to see if tried.
