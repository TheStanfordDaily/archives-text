# UNEMPLOYMENT TIPS
## 
### 
Equipped for competition under an anti(|iie social order,
the present day university graduate linds himself faced
with an employment problem far more grave than that
which faced his father. Recognizing this fact, the Voca
tional Guidance Committee lias obtained as guest speaker
for this morning's assembly a woman admirably suited to
advise prospective graduates puzzled by the frustration of
I heir vocational plans.
Dr. Lillian Gilhreth, psychologist and president of her
own company of engineering consultants, is thoroughly
familiar with all phases of the economic crisis. She has
chosen as her subject "Guidance in a Changing Order" and
will treat of the necessity for self-adaptation during a pe
riod of social reorganization. At present in charge of the
women's division of President Hoover's Commission for
the Relief of rnemployment, Mrs. Gilhreth is vitally human
and intensely interested in the problems of individual stu
dents.
After her lecture, the speaker,will meet all students who
wish to see her personally in the t'nion lobby. The Voca
tional Guidance Committee could not have made a wiser
choice of speaker for an all-l'niversily assembly at the
present time. Prospective graduates would do well to at
tend the lecture and make personal appointments with Dr.
(iilbreth later.
