# NOW WHAT WILL IT BE?

It is with a certain degree of regret that the Daily sees
hazing at California pass into the limbo of forgotten tradi
tions.
Abolition of the time-honored practice of making life
uncomfortable for freshman came, in a ruling of the Rlue
and Gold executive committee last week, like a bolt from
the blue, unforeseen and uncompromising.
No longer will lirst year Californians be required to
wear their little green lids. No longer will they bj* repri
mended for smoking on the campus, or for talking to
women.
It has been ten years since Stanford hazed its freshmen,
and for ten years the Farm has been a saner university.
1 lie only material advantage, perhaps, has been increasing
comfort for yearlings. Rut tlie real reward of being a non
hazing institution lias come in pride and self-satisfaction,
in the opportunity for remarking upon our broadminded
ness in contrast to the narrow vision of universities that
permitted Ihe childish and nefarious practice.
Needless to say, the battered Rear across the bay has
been our star example. Now all that is gone. Never again
can California's simplicity be pointed out in argument or
in editorial through citation of prep school hazing activi
ties.
Alas, some other means, and it can hardly be as good ;is
tin' one just lost, will have to be devised.
All enterprising journalists who wish to maintain af
filiations with the staff of this newspaper be ON TIME this
afternoon when all meet to receive the weekly blessings
and curses.
