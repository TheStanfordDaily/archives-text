# BULL SESSION

### 
Because CO campus actors were
putting on a much better perform
ance than advance dope U»ul cred
ited them with or natural incredu
lity had thought possible—because
pennies at Shakespeare are com
parable to pennies at Sermon on the
Mount, the action by sevei'al per
sons the other evening was severely
criticized. In no lest than foyr
places yesterday's Daily lashed
those who, through habit, perver
sity, or dramatic taste, dropped
small copper discs from the balcony
on to the stage.
Our world is so created in every
aspect that he who praises is given
an overstuffed chair while the con
demnor sits on hard, splinter-laden
benches. The individual who gets in
the swim—keeps afloat with his
feet, applauds with his hands, and
bellows forth enthusiastic hallelu
jahs is enthroned, in our opinion.
The other extreme who thinks those
in the swim are all wet, hisses them
from the shore, and bombards them
with pennies is placed in the lowest
hollow of opinionary hell.
Those that boo and hiss in a
theatre are condemned; and their
richer brothers who express their
opinion in copper coin oi' the realm
are scourged with powerful adjec
tives. Those that disturb the pro
duction with criticizing noises of any
kind deserve the same condemna
tion as those that break into a play
to applaud. Both manifestations i

THE COPPER CLOUDBURST

| should be reserved for the curtain.
| At that time it seems justifiable for
j all to express their like or dislike.
, Those that are not enjoying the
I evening have even greater right to
j express their feelings than their
j more fortunate brothers.
! There is a plea that evidences of
j disapproval ruin the play for the
[rest. But it is evident that this is
I no more the case than is my com
j plete disgust for some poor per
formance bitterly augmented by
I those that clap for want of better
j use for their hands. Having two
I hands and the custom of applause
before them, we can expect clap-
I ping at any play by one group.
! Having pennies and the tradition
j of tossing them, we can with equal
I certainty expect the other group to
' drop them on to the stage.
j There is the claim, too, that even
j penny-tossing and booing at the
i end of an aet or at the end of the
| play is vulgar and impolite. Silence
should be the manner of expressing
j disapproval, it is held. This is much
; too passive, offers no outlet for the
! emotions, and prevents the minority
j from making itself felt. Of course
j blind criticism like blind booing is
j meaningless and inane. Intelligent
I booing—reserved for the end of a
| play or the end of the act —is in
! structive for the management, justi
| fiable for the audience, and proper
j in the informal atmosphere of the
j "Farm." —Abe Mellinkoff
