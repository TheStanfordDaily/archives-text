THE TRADER'S WlFE—Jean Ken
yon (Mackenzie-Coward-McCann,
Inc.).
Jean Kenyon has endeavored to
put into fiction the essence of her
own African experience. By trans
planting a sheltered New England
girl to the African slave coast, she
has given a vivid picture of its ef
fects on the white woman.
Her heroine married an African
trader and believed it her duty to
follow him. She could not be dis
suaded, for the romance of the situ
ation appealed to her. To the na
tives she was as a goddess from a
strange land, and they worshipped
her. When the monotonous rainy
season set in, the novelty wore off,
and she grew discontented and un
happy.
The book is exceptionally well
written. The grave and measured
prose is as exquisite as poetry, and
imparts a. definite charm to the
book. The story itself is told in a
very uninteresting manner, and one
gathers that the author was more
concerned with writing perfect
prose than in telling an interesting
story. —A.A.
SKY DEVILS — At the Varsity
Theatre.
Howard Hughes and his pet air
planes again, but this time he pro
duces sheer comedy instead of the
"mellerdrammer" of "Hell's An
gels." Stunt flying is thrilling to
watch even in pictures but too
much as in everything, is too much.
The producer of "Sky Devils"' seems
to have realized this and shown
just enough to keep you on the
edge of your seat and not enough |
to become boring.
Spencer Tracy, as the shiftless
hard-hitting idiot who gets into the
air force purely by accident, shows
himself to be a really fine comedian
and a good actor, both rare qualities
for Hollywood. William Boyd as the
hard-boiled sergeant manages to
elicit sympathy for his innumerable
misfortunes despite his hard-boiled
manner.
The feminine element is well rep
resented by Ann Dvorak as the
American girl who comes to enter
tain the boys at the airdrome and
stays to entertain the audience with
the scrapes she gets into in the
company of Tracy and the sergeant,
and Yola D'Avril as the more or
less innocent little French cafe

' singer who also contributes her
mite to the trouble that the boys
find every time they turn around.
Magnificent stunt flying, some
thrilling bombing, and a lot of good
clean (almost) fun, make this first
blass entertainment. An Our Gang
comedy too if you happen to like
them. —S.C.A.
GIRL CRAZY—At the Stanford
Theatre.
If anything ought to take your
mind off the depression, this "Girl
Crazy" should do the trick. In fact,
Wheeler and Woolsey pull a hyp
notic act that's guaranteed to bring
a laugh, if not two of them. These
two loose nuts manage to get all
mixed up in Custerville politics,
with a bunch of chorus beauties
thrown in for good measure.
Thanks to fast gags and a few
song "hits" (Arline Judge sings
well), the plot proceeds in bang-up
style. Dorothy Lee has a negative
| part opposite Eddie Quillan, but
Mitzi Green pulls another sneaker
and imitates Edna May Oliver to
i perfection. Hereafter, any producer
who chills at the thought of having
the show "stolen"' had better check
| up the cast to see if a certain Miss
Green is among those present.
Wait till you view Wheeler and
Woolsey as Big Chief Whoopie and
; his squaw, "Sitting Pretty." Well,
isn't that enough?
Wallace Beery dressed up as an
old maid, cut from a show way back
in 1900, is worfrh something or other
in the way of news reels. —J.B.
THE FINAL EDITION—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
During the opening scenes one
gets the impression that this is
going to be just another newspaper
| picture. You get sidewise glimpses
of "copy rooms" with the inevitable
j cry of "copy boy."
Then the plot broadens out and
becomes realistic. In quick succes
sion we have the heroine fired of!
1 the newspaper, a murder of a dis
! trict attorney, a gangster running
I out of town, and the heroine on his
: trail as the detective-for-the-paper.
Mae Clarke gives a more con
sistent portrayal of plot than she
| has ever given before. J.H.G.
It costs 22 cents per pupil per
I day to operate the public schools of
j North Carolina.
