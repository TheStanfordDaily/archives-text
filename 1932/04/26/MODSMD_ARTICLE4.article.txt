# LINDY MAY ASK CAPONE'S HELP
## Gang Chief Opposed In Plea To Review Case 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 25. (JP)—\
The government today vigorously
opposed Al Capone's last desperate
attempt to find a legal escape from
his eleven year prison sentence. The
gang leader has asked the Supreme
Court to review his conviction for
evading income tax payments and
an answer to his plea will probably
be given Monday.
Capone is being held incommuni
cado in his Chicago jail cell upon
orders from the White House pend
ing the Lindbergs' decision on pro- j
posals of the gangster to recover J
their kidnaped son.
The Lindbergh family are giv- j
ing much thought to the advisability
of accepting Capone's offers, par
ticularly since the $50,000 ransom
failed to affect the return of their
child.
The Lindberghs are willing to give j
Capone due '"credit" if he should J
find their son but do not wish to j
place themselves in the position of i
sponsoring his release.
