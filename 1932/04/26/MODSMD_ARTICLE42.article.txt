j The Editor, Sir:
Neither Shakespeare's play nur !
! the Stanford director of dramatics
! deserve the criticism launched
against them in yesterday's editorial j
column. The incident of a few 1
"groundlings" tossing pennies upon
the stage should not blind u.s to ihe
! fact that the production of "Romeo j
i and Juliet" was warmly received.
It perhaps did not occur to ihe J
| editor that the "exceptional work |
' of the artists" was due in part to i
j Mr. Helvenston's directing. Doubt- j
j less, too, lie failed to appreciate the j
: director's exquisite stage settings •
which lent both beauty and charm j
■ to the entire production.
I for one wish to congratulate Mr. j
| Helvenston on his selection of a !
: play and the commendable way in
j which it was produced.
Oscar O. Winther
