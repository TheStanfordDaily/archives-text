# DEFENDS HISSING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I submit the following for Cam- '
! pus Opinion.
It seems to me that the choice of i
I Harold Helvenston in the play pre
i sented last Friday night was a par- i
1 ticularly happy one—the occasion,
I the birthday of the greatest of the
j bards, the play, his story of ihe re- 1
. volt of youth, one which gives the i
I amateur actor an opportunity to
"outdo the professional."
Why should staid auditors object
Ito the activities of the penny- !
i throwers? They but added an Eliza- 1
j bethan touch to the celebration. The
i groundlings of Shakespeare's day
| were ever ready to throw even more
I offensive objects than pennies and
i to hiss more loudly than the rough
j est of the Roughs. The actors were
| expected to quiet the unruly by the !
; excellence of their performance.
! The Stanford actors rose to the oc- !
| casion in like manner, and soon,
even the penny-throwers were lis
tening. ♦
At the end of the play, there was
j no doubt as 1o the decision of the ,
t audience. The ranks of the Staid
i and the Rough joined in vociferous
j congratulation of Harold Helven
j ston, his choice of play, his cast,
, and his sets. —Elsie R. Renne j
