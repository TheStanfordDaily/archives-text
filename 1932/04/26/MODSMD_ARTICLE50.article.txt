YOU CAN'T gamble on the ponies
• the pups in California. It is !
,ainst the law, like bootlegging, j
ut there is no law against concen- l
ated grape juice, and neither is i
ere a law against options.
Thtre is a .sign at Tanforan which j
ys that positively no betting or j
unbling is allowed. Bui a lot of |
istomers step on each other's corns j
lore each race trying to get to j
me windows where you may pur- J
uise an option on your favorite j
'fe
ll and providing your hay-burner j
ods in first, the owner of the
me will repurchase your option <
r a consideration . . . and you j
>n't have to wait six weeks, as is |
v case with the grape juice.
THE PRICES at which op
tions are being refunded at
Tanforan have not been par
ticularly pleasing to the racing
gentry of late, however, and
many have been going to the
dogs—at Belmont.
For instance, options which 1
cost $.'{ were refunded for only
$4.50 when Foljdorus galloped
home in tiie Oakland Handicap
at Tanforan Saturday. Two-dol- ,
lar place options brought a j
profit of only 40 cents—all of
which is not a very great return j
for the risk involved.
Of course, there are those
who say that putting money on
Polydorus is not risking it hut is
merely good business. Never- |
tlieless, the nag might break a
le£. or stop to nibble at the
grass, or something.
At Belmont, however, the i
dogs pay a much higher return.
Even the heavy favorites usu
ally net the option purchaser at j
least the amount of the original
investment.
PURCHASERS OF OPTIONS, j
;e most business men, are quick 1
figure this out. And while the '
rill that belongs to the '"sport of I
ags ' continues to pack them in at ,
San Bruno track, larger and
•ger crowds are being attracted i
the evening festivities at Bel- I
jnt.
Ot course the pooches aren't so ;
liable as the ponies, which is one ;
tson the payof't is as good as it is.
»u never can be sure what a dog i
11 do. They have a bad habit of I
iwing up now and then near the
ish to wrangle over some canine
itter.
There is one tiling, however— i
file dog racing has never had a j
rticularly savory reputation, it is ]
certainty that a purp cannot be ;
ibed. When he sets out on his!
'itless pursuit of the electric rab- j
, a dog gives the best that's in |
n—barring, of course, some spe- !
il canine matter.

YOU CAN'T gamble on the ponies
• the pups in California. It is !
,ainst the law, like bootlegging, j
ut there is no law against concen- l
ated grape juice, and neither is i
ere a law against options.
Thtre is a .sign at Tanforan which j
ys that positively no betting or j
unbling is allowed. Bui a lot of |
istomers step on each other's corns j
lore each race trying to get to j
me windows where you may pur- J
uise an option on your favorite j
'fe
ll and providing your hay-burner j
ods in first, the owner of the
me will repurchase your option <
r a consideration . . . and you j
>n't have to wait six weeks, as is |
v case with the grape juice.
THE PRICES at which op
tions are being refunded at
Tanforan have not been par
ticularly pleasing to the racing
gentry of late, however, and
many have been going to the
dogs—at Belmont.
For instance, options which 1
cost $.'{ were refunded for only
$4.50 when Foljdorus galloped
home in tiie Oakland Handicap
at Tanforan Saturday. Two-dol- ,
lar place options brought a j
profit of only 40 cents—all of
which is not a very great return j
for the risk involved.
Of course, there are those
who say that putting money on
Polydorus is not risking it hut is
merely good business. Never- |
tlieless, the nag might break a
le£. or stop to nibble at the
grass, or something.
At Belmont, however, the i
dogs pay a much higher return.
Even the heavy favorites usu
ally net the option purchaser at j
least the amount of the original
investment.
PURCHASERS OF OPTIONS, j
;e most business men, are quick 1
figure this out. And while the '
rill that belongs to the '"sport of I
ags ' continues to pack them in at ,
San Bruno track, larger and
•ger crowds are being attracted i
the evening festivities at Bel- I
jnt.
Ot course the pooches aren't so ;
liable as the ponies, which is one ;
tson the payof't is as good as it is.
»u never can be sure what a dog i
11 do. They have a bad habit of I
iwing up now and then near the
ish to wrangle over some canine
itter.
There is one tiling, however— i

rticularly savory reputation, it is ]
certainty that a purp cannot be ;
