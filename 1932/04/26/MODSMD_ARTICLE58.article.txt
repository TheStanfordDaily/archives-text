# INELIGIBLE FROSH PLACES FOR CARDS IN GAELIC TRACK
## 
### 
Jumping five feet, nine inches,
Dan Lamont, ineligible freshman,
was the only Stanford yearling to
compete in the Gaelic Association
track meet last Sunday. Lamont
tied for third place with Dick Rice,
California varsity high-jumper.
Oliver Johnston, freshman high
jumper, who is spending his spare
hours perfecting his hop-step-and
jump form, withdrew at the last
minute when he found that his short
experience with the event did net
yet enable him to get the required
distance on the middle step.
Johnston's high-jumping experi
ence is expected to come in handy
on Ihe preliminary hop; the final
jump will be well taken care of, as
Johnston competed in this event
while attending Palo Alto High
School.
