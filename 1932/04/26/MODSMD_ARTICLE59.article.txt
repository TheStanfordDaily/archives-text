# Caddell Turns Out For Football Duty
## Warner Encouraged as Practice Shows Improvement Over Previous Week; Campbell Plays 
### 
j The light on ihe football front
â€¢ was shining considerably brighter
; last night, following a workout and
I scrimmage which looked far more
i promising than the slow affair
! which took place last Friday.
First oi all, a rather pleased smile
| spread on the otherwise sombre
| countenance of Coach Pop Warner
i as Ernie Caddel and Gordy Camp-
I bell, free from their duties on the
j baseball te:.m, turned out for prac
tice in grid uniforms.
Caddell assumed Ihe halfback du
j ties on the first-string eleven, in
1 the backfield with Jack Hillman,
| although he was unacquainted with
i many of the new plays. Campbell
I stood on the sidelines, getting a
| lineup on some of the 11X52 forma
! tions. Stan Anderson, another fobt
| ball man who also donates his ser
vices to the baseball squad, has not
j yet come out.
Line Snappy
The men on the line seemed lo

! wake up to the fact that they were
playing football in yesterday's
! sci immage. On Friday, their play
was listless and lacked the charge
and fire that is necessary for good
line play.
Line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill
shifted his men about a little with
satisfactory results. Card was shift
ed to the first-string guard post,
playing with Corbus. At center in
yesterday's scrimmage was Bill
j Bates, replacing Mar Albertson, who
was injured in Friday's skirmish.
Rogers, Tod as Ends
Thorny Rogers, who has been laid
up for a short time, returned to the
i fold and played end on the first
string squad, along with Jay Tod.
i The second-string eleven lined up
with Blanchard, center; Carver and
Morgan, guards; Keller and Ran
some, tackles; Gillespie and Miller,
ends; Hancock, fullback; Moore,
quarter; and Spencer and Sander
i son, halves.
