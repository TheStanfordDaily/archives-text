MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 25. (JP)â€”
Tornadoes killed at least five per
sons in farming communities of this
vicinity today, injured a score or
more, and also did extensive dam
age in other sections of the state
and in Arkansas, Kentucky, and in
northern Alabama last night.
The storm apparently swept across
the Mississippi river from Arkansas
after striking in the eastern section
of that state. It hit in the northern
end of Shelby county, about 20
miles from Memphis.
