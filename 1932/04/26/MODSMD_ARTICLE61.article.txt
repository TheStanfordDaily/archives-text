# QUALIFYING ROUNDS OF GOLF TOURNEY COMPLETED TODAY
## 
### 
Qualifying rounds for the Stan
ford University golf tournament
close today, so that all scores must
be in the hands of Eddie Twiggs,
golf pro, by tonight.
Bad weather which dampened the
fairways kept many players off the
course yesterday, but those who
have not played their eighteen-hole
medal round and plan to enter the
tournament will compete today. The
best 32 scores will qualify for the
match play which will get under
way within a few days.
Charlie Seaver, Harry Eichelber
ger, and Jerry Trautman will hold
the spotlight this afternoon as they
go around the course in an attempt
to better the tournament-leading
score made by Dick Hoag last week.
Hoag's mark of 76 is five over par.
Herman Hellman is laying of! for
several days to keep from going
stale before his match in the finals
of the Oakland City golf tourna
ment this Sunday.
Of seven famous liars in history,
six are English.
