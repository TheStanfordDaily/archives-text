# DE BROGLIE LIGHT THEORY IS TOPIC OF CHEMIST'S TALK
## Professor Gillet Of Liege, Belgium, Introduced; Studies Colloids 
### 
At a joint Chemistry and Physics
Seminar yesterday afternoon in the
Chemistry Building, Dr. I. Ester
man, International Research fellow
from the University of California,
talked on the De Broglie equation
and explained a mechanical method
of proving it.
The De Broglie theory tries to
reconcile the dual properties of
light which seems to be at once
made up of particles and waves and
lias always been checked before by
electrical means rather than me
chanical ones.
Professor Mc√üain of the chemis
try department who introduced the
speaker also introduced Professor
Gillet of Liege, Belgium, noted in
dustrial chemist who is here for a
few days on a visit in order to
study colloids.
