# Senate To Hear Heflin Plea For Alabama Seat
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 25. (/P; â€”
By a dramatic roll call only decided
by a last-second switch of a vote,
former Senator J. Thomas Heflin to
day was granted the privilege of
speaking once more in the Senate.
His familiar voice will be raised
again in the chamber in support of
his effort to unseat Senator John S.
Bankhead, who beat him in 1930
after Heflin had been barred from
the Democratic primary because he
refused to support A1 Smith for
President.
