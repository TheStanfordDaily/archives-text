An old-fashioned bar, designed to show the evils of liquor and the saloon, was one of the principal
exhibits at the prohibition fair in Washngton. In this strange setting two of the nation's leading prohibi
tionists posed for photographers. The picture was made as Bishop James Cannon, jr., Methodist Episcopal
Church South, introduced William S. Chase (right), chairman of the International Reform Federation,
to the bartender.
