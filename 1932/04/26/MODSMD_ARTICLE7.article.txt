# EPICUREAN ETHICS TOPIC TONIGHT
## 
### 
Outlining the work of Epicurus,
the philosopher for the "plain man,"
Dr. Cyril Bailey, one of the fore
most living classical scholars, and
visiting professor from Oxford at
the University of California, will
speak tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the
Little Theatre on "The Ethics of
Epicurus."
Dr. Bailey's extensive work in the
classics has identified him with this
study since his publication of a
critical edition of Lucretius in IH9B.
Since that time much of his effort
has been directed toward criticism
and translation of the works of Lu
cretius and his master, Epicurus.
Included among Dr. Bailey's pub
lications are the extant remains of
the works of Epicurus with an Eng
lish translation, a study of "The
Greek Atomist and Epicurus," prose
translations of Lucretius, and "The
Religion of Ancient Rome." He has
served as editor of an anthology of
translations from Latin writers, with
descriptive essays by various schol
ars, titled "The Mind of Rome."
