participate in an impromptu debate,
when Mary Rechif and Lucile Smith
meet a team from U.S.C. Thursday,
debating on a subject to be chosen

of an extensive debate tour of the
North.
The debate will be held in the
Little Theatre at 8 o'clock. Mary-
Katherine Morris, Joffre debater
and recently elected A.W.S. presi
dent, will be the chairman.
