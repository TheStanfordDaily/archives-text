day the problem of continuing the A.S.S.U. Concert Series was made j
last night by the Associated Students Executive Committee at one of the
lengthiest meetings it has held in over a year.
The Concert Series question has been before Ex Committee at frequent
intervals during the year, and last night's decision is the result of several
months' deliberation.
Albert L. Denney. student manager, and Helen Ullmann, Concert Series
manager, were directed to prepare a financial statement of the current
series and a prospective budget for the projected series in time

for student body consideration Tues

A constitutional amendment was
proposed by the committee for sub
mission to the student body at the
regular spring elections, changing
the method of choosing Men's
Council members. The amendment
would provide for the appointment
of councilmen by a group composed
of the A.S.S.U. president, Men's
Council chairman, and the graduate
member of Ex Committee, instead
of the present system of popular
election.
