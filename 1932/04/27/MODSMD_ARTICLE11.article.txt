# EPICURE SYSTEM TOLD BY BAILEY
## Misconceptions Dispelled By Noted Lecturer 
### 
Reconstructing the philosophy of
Epicurus, to dispel the popular mis
conception of the doctrine of pleas
ure, Dr. Cyril Bailey, visiting Sa
ther Professor of the Classics at the
University of California from Ox
ford, spoke last night in the Little
Theatre on "The Ethics of Epi
curus."
The basis of the misunderstanding
which has been current for cen
turies, Dr. Bailey said, was that by
his statement that pleasure is the
end of life, Epicurus meant physical
pleasure. His philosophy, however,
founded on the practical atomistic
belief, Dr. Bailey stated, evolved to
a mental status, which became his
doctrine of "egotistic hedonism."
Pleasure and pain, Dr. Bailey ex
plained, were named as the only
sensations by Epicurus, pleasure be
ing complete when pain was en
tirely removed. Virtue, he said, was
not good in itself, according to Epi
curus, but only that it led to the
pleasurable life. Epicurus' explana
tions of the principal virtues, the
speaker continued, were practically
and basically egotistic, as was the
rest of his philosophy.
Records of Epicurus' life among
his disciples at Athens, Dr. Bailey
concluded, prove that his doctrine
was not inhuman, but, compared to
(he beliefs of other philosophers, his
theory may be criticized for its dis
regard for primary human ten
dencies.
Individualistic tendencies, rather,
are justified by the Epicurean sys
tem of thought.
