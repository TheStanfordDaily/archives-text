# Ambulance Mistaken for Patrol Wagon by Spike
## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Anglo-Saxon, chipper five-year
old Spike, takes the ambulance for
a patrol wagon.
First to spot it, as it swings lei
surely up the drive, he jumps about,
tense and thrilling in his crib,
shouting with excitement.
"Geez kids, de cops!" An infec
i tious exuberance that spreads down
| the row of cribs, until a nurse
j comes, shaking her fly-away cap
I with its tiny red S in the corner,
| to explain that this is no police car,
but a San Francisco ambulance
bringing sick city children to enjoy
I the benefits of life on the Farm.
Conditioned vs. Cops
At Spike's house, before he moved
; to Stanford, the patrol car was a
not infrequent visitor, its approach
productive of much swarming about
of neighbors and a concomitant
I dragging-olf of one's father or

[mother to jail.
I So that it is an old familiar scene,
land not amiss here, even in the
j quiet confines of fir and eucalyptus,
i Last autumn, though he was not
feeling so well. Spike picked up a
lively football fantacism from other
avid but crib-cloistered adherents
I of the Stanford grid.
Football Fan
He has listened, eager though
IxilTled, to all Stanford's football
j games over the radio. He is the
I pleased possessor of several stadium
| programs with the team roster,
| prized, however untintelligible.
He is the guest and protege of
■ three-thousand-odd Stanford men
and women. He is one of their
l staunchcst enthusiasts. He is sweet
; faced, blond, resourceful. And on
| the bounty of his campus friends,
j rests his hope for .strengthened
■; lungs.
