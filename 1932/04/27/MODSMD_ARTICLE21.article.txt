# Disabled Cindermen Hamper Indian Team On Eve of Big Meet
## Eastman and Jones Main Stanford Supporters; Wykoff Expected to Provide Serious Competition 
### 
IGHT national champions and several more near-titleholders will lake
part in the big cinder spree between Stanford and the University of
Southern California Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles. It so happens
that six of the octette will be taking the parts of modern Trojans while
but a paltry pair will try and uphold the bloody Stanford Red.
Troy's champions include co-Captains Frank WykofT and Bob Ilall, and
Bill Carls, Jim Stewart, Dick Barber, and Bill (iraber. Stanford's stars
are Ben Eastman and Bob Jones, and these two will provide three of the

t'four certain Indian victories.
Case of Hall
The case of Captain and Champion
Hall is indeed sad. Last year, Bob
beat George Grey and Nellie Gray
of Stanford out of first in the
1.C.4-A. shot-put, and Saturday he
may not place, and can't possibly
be doped better than third. Gray,
Lyman, and Laborde of the Cards
have all done better this year than
; has Hall, as has his teammate Har
-1 per. George Grey, who finished sec
ond in the Harvard meet last year,
| probably won't even make the trip.
! This coast is no place for champion
! shot-putters.
Wykoff Undefeated
WykofT has won the 1.C.4-A. 100-
| yard dash title for the last two
! years, while managing during the
j same period to be undefeated by
i one and all. Barber and Graber an
j nexed the broad-jump and pole
j vault championships in the same
j meet, and all three of these Tro
| jans look good for first against the
| Indians.
Bob Jones is the only certain
i Stanford high jump entry, although
\ Bill Ellington said yesterday that
, both Don Blackmail and Keebles
! might make the trip.
Stanford's sure wins are in the
1 discus, —where a sweep for the
; Cards is inevitable with Jones, La
borde, and Gray all beyond the 160-
j foot mark in practice—in the 440
and the 880, where Ben Eastman is
i inevitable—and in the shot, where
Nellie Gray is inevitable.
Ray On Javelin
The javelin seems only a bit less
j certain, as Ai Ray has done con-
I siderable feet better than Crom
-1 well's best tossers. In addition, Dave
j Brown came up out of nowhere
I Monday afternoon with a throw of
! 193 feet, and may get third place.
The little bundle of nerves and
| sore muscles on whose condition
j rest Stanford's chances for a sur
( prise victory in the meet—Les Ha-
I bles—is now in Los Angeles being
| treated for sinus trouble in a last
I effort to get into shape. Les is one
of the near-champions mentioned
j above, as he got second in the
! 1.C.4-A. 220, and fourth in the 100
| last year.
I Yesterday's workouts were easy
j affairs because of the cold weather,
j as Ellington is taking no chances of
I more disastrous injuries. The men
all ran shorter distances than they
will attempt on Saturday, trying to
get up the necessary speed to kick
dirt in the Trojans' nice, clean faces.
