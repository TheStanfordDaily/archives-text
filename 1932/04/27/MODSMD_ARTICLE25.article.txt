# Missing German Veteran Returns From Long Exile

### 
BERLIN, April 26. (A 3 ) â€” Paul
Schwartz, a German army veteran,
who was forgotten for twelve years
during which he was a French
prisoner of war at Devil's Island,
came back to Germany today once
more to enjoy freedom.
Because he was born in Corsica
the French who found him at Kiel
in 1919, charged him with high
treason. Corsica is French and the
French law claims as citizens all
children of the second generation
born on national territory.
Schwartz was court-martialed and
sent to Devil's Island. For years he
was forgotten. Then someone told
the Foreign Office about him, and
the French commuted his sentence.
