# ENTER THE NEW RULERS

### 
Tonight the 1 new undergraduate division of women's
government will take oflice when the recent!y-eleeted
A.W'.S. president and her Council replace the old officials
who have labored so hard and so diligently for women's
lights this past year.
Always the constructive actions of the past Council will
gleam like a beacon through the fog of red tape, leading the
new group on towards more rights for the women and the 4
ever-increasing power of student government.
As the women, as is their moral right, nonchalantly
light their cigarettes in the rooting section while watching
the Farm grid stars in action, they will bless that body of
far-seeing and broadminded ollicials who defied the
cramped and moss-eaten morals of a passing Puritanism
to allow them the pleasure and privilege of smoking at
games.
W hen next year's freshmen pause from their arduous
labors on the bonfire to drink a cup of coffee and eat a
sandwich handed to them by some fair co-ed, they will
mumble thanks to that Council of the year before which
did not, through some misguided idea of morals or other
abstractions, set a precedent by prohibiting the women
from working on the bontire.
Hut then A.W'.S. government (that is, as much of it as is
permitted students) should not he such a difficult propo
sition. Women are like a flock of sheep. If a strong leader
takes a stand 011 anv problem the rest will quickly and
timidly fall in line. Any dissenters are regarded as slightly
insane and are rapidly hushed up. Arguments presented
by their rulers are swallowed whole, to be repeated with
fanatical enthusiasm.
Although slightly skeptical of the utility of women's
government, the Daily hopefully wishes the new president
and her Council a successful administration.
