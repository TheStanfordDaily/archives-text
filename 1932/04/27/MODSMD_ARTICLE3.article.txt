# Defense Says Slaying Made Islands Safe
## Momentary Insanity Plea Cannot Free Four 
### 
HONOLULU, April 26. (/P> â€” :
Prosecution and defease vied for j
the favor of the racially mixed jury I
in legal arguments as the trial of j
Lieutenant Thomas H. Massie, Mrs. !
Granville Foi'tescue, and two navy j
enlisted men for the killing of Jo- i
seph Kahahawai entered its con
cluding phase today.
Barry S. Ulrich, associate prose
cutor, hinted In his argument that j
the Territory had won an important j
point in the instructions to the jury j
regarding the insanity plea set up ;
in behalf of Massie.
Ulrich said Judge Charles S. ;
Davis would instruct that for the i
defense to show that Massie was j
insane the moment he fired the shot j
which killed Kahahawai would not
be sufficient to clear him.
Although Judge Davis will not
deliver his instructions until after i
the closing arguments, he did not :
challenge Ulrich's statement, nor |
did the defense do so.
In its testimony the defense set :
up the claim that Massie was in- j
sane only from the time Kahahawai !
admitted attacking Mrs. Thalia Mas- '
sis, wife of the accused officer, until
Massie was arrested less than two j
hours later.
Fighting for sympathy with the
accused four, George S. Leisure, as- j
sociate of Clarence Darrow in the j
defense, asserted that, except for j
the native's death, other women ;
might have suffered criminal at- j
tacks.
