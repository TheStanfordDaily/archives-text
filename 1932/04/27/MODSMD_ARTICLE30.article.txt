# COLUMBIA ADOPTS PLATFORMS
## 
### 
Yesterday's Daily carried an editorial, captioned "Uni
versity Polities," which suggested tlie possibility that
greater and more intelligent interest in campus elections
could be obtained if candidates for ollicc were to take
public stands on matters of student government. That this
idea is not confined to Stanford, but is springing up in
others of the more conservative colleges is indicated by a
recent editorial in the (Columbia Spectator.
Several aspirants for Student Hoard positions set a
novel precedent at the metropolitan university by declar
ing their views on various local issues, and in commenting
on this action the Spectator said;
"The failure of Student Hoard to function other than as
an honorary ollicc, we believe, is due to the system ol re
cruiting its members. In the pasl, men who combined im
pressive athletic or activity records with a reasonable
popularity were the logical contenders and there was very
little choice between them.
"Hut the undergraduate has begun to think. He has
come to question some of the conventions that dictate what
bis attitude should be. lie is no longer willing to scratch a
mark opposite the name of a s!;ir halfback in the hope that
the star athlete will also prove an able leader."
Columbia's problems may not be identical with Stan
lord's, but, at least, the above quoted opinion serves to
show ;i trend of college thought in matters of student poli
tics under conditions similar to those prevailing here. If
the institution of political platforms will help to root out
official deadwood, as the Spectator evidently believes it
will, this practice would be well worth a trial at Stanford.
