# BULL SESSION
## SOAK THE RICH 
### 
Every time that (he handful of:
liberal senators begin talking about
i raising taxes, the so-called "rich"
perspire freely—writhe noticeably,
I and howl loudly. Then following
■ the attempt to raise -taxes, a cam
paign is launched by newspapers—
which are or would like to be capi
talistic—condemning those that are
planning to "soak the rich. ' This is
an unfortunate but fairly accurate
phrase, however.
It is accurate because who else is j
there to soak but the rich. This de
pression has decreased tax ability
among everybody. Those, however,
1 who are still rich obviously are the
only ones that can afford large
taxes. While it is true even their
income has decreased, they are not
being asked to pay on what they i
lost but rather on what they are
still getting. That the rate will have
to be boosted is unpleasant but
I necessary. The government is faced
with more expenditures due to the
depression and due to the same de
pression the income has constricted
itself into a very small corner.
~~
There are only two alternatives
! and in this case it is necessary to
I take both of them. One is to saddle
the future with a public debt — !
which is not so unfair considering j
this is expected to be an unusual
j situation. By carrying on now, we |
' are making it nice and rosy for;
them. They should pay a fee for
this service—the fee being a public !

: debt. Jhe other alternative is to
raise what is possible at the present.
To raise that money, we just take
it from where it will be least missed
and where it will do the least harm.
That place is obviously where
money abounds- in the pockets of
the rich. The recent sales tax —a
measure that would hit everybody
with approximate mathematical
equality was obviously unfair. It
was based on the principle that pro
claims a ten per cent wage cut in
the firm from the president's $2,000
per week to the stenog's $20 per
week. As Heywood Broun pointed
out—for the president to lose $200
is not even comparable to the
stenog's loss of $2.
That taxes can be much higher
i and still not bring eternal ruin
upon the land was clearly evi
denced during the World War—and
is being proven in England today.
The argument that high taxes will
curtail initiative among the hiring
class is unfounded—until taxes be
come even higher than they were
. during the war. Because a man has
' to yield an extra ten per cent of
his income to the itching palm' of
the law, is no reason for suppos
ing that out of spite, he will stop
! creating more money.
The problem is somebody must be
| soaked to get necessary income. The
i answer is "soak the rich"—who else
is there to soak?
