' Heck! Pish and again tosh. A fine
kettle of old fish! Things have come !
to a pretty pass! I have decided,
practically, to change my mind
about going around the world and |
go on a haunting trip from ghost,
to ghost instead. Life is a husk, 110 i
more. Here I get my old friend;
Hank Slatch back home at Stanford
(the place where the color of life is j
red—you remember) to send me the ;
Daily's daily news by special leased
wireless, and for days and days I 1
have been licking my chops in an
ticipation of some juicy bits of cam
pus gossip, and what do I get?
"Of seven famous liars in his
tory, six are English." "Don't call
anyone a fool; you might hear |
an echo." "Stanford men de
clare it is bad luck to wear a
bow tie to an exam." Such guff!
I have been gone lo these many j
many days but goodness me I still j
know several Stanford men who i
know it's bad luck to wear anything J
to an exam. In fact most of them '
' are pretty sure it isn't beckoning
smiling fortune to go to an exam at
all.
It's pretty hard to read 011 the
boat here—this China sea is

pretty choppy—but I manage to
liit the headlines, and I see that
tltc annual convalescent home
appeal will begin its "three
days of feverish activity" pretty
soon. What a fine, splendid
place dear old Stanford is be
coming! I can't remember the
last time there was feverish ac
tivity for even one day, but I
think it was when the Pi Phi's
lost a legacy hack in '00.
Hank tells me that one of the ex
moguls on the campus newspaper
is now living at the fire house, and
hurrying to all the Roble false
alarms. It's nice to have something
like that for young journalists to
look forward to. The only trouble
is that they will all be wanting to
be fire chief instead of editor, be
cause the fire chief gets three dol
lars more a month.
I also see by the paper that
"the fact that neither China nor
Japan has declared war makes
one ask the question, "When is
a war not a war?'" Well, well!
I'll hear that in mind and send
you a report from the battle
front if this tub ever gets there.
Please do better. Hank.

tltc annual convalescent home
appeal will begin its "three
days of feverish activity" pretty
soon. What a fine, splendid
place dear old Stanford is be
coming! I can't remember the
last time there was feverish ac
tivity for even one day, but I
think it was when the Pi Phi's
lost a legacy hack in '00.
Hank tells me that one of the ex
moguls on the campus newspaper
is now living at the fire house, and
hurrying to all the Roble false
alarms. It's nice to have something
like that for young journalists to
look forward to. The only trouble
is that they will all be wanting to
be fire chief instead of editor, be
cause the fire chief gets three dol
lars more a month.
I also see by the paper that
"the fact that neither China nor
Japan has declared war makes
one ask the question, "When is
a war not a war?'" Well, well!
I'll hear that in mind and send
you a report from the battle
front if this tub ever gets there.
Please do better. Hank.
Yours, W.
' Heck! Pish and again tosh. A fine
kettle of old fish! Things have come !
to a pretty pass! I have decided,
practically, to change my mind
about going around the world and |
go on a haunting trip from ghost,
to ghost instead. Life is a husk, 110 i
more. Here I get my old friend;
Hank Slatch back home at Stanford
(the place where the color of life is j
red—you remember) to send me the ;
Daily's daily news by special leased
wireless, and for days and days I 1
have been licking my chops in an
ticipation of some juicy bits of cam
pus gossip, and what do I get?
"Of seven famous liars in his
tory, six are English." "Don't call
anyone a fool; you might hear |
an echo." "Stanford men de
clare it is bad luck to wear a
bow tie to an exam." Such guff!
I have been gone lo these many j
many days but goodness me I still j
know several Stanford men who i
know it's bad luck to wear anything J
to an exam. In fact most of them '
' are pretty sure it isn't beckoning
smiling fortune to go to an exam at
all.
It's pretty hard to read 011 the
boat here—this China sea is

pretty choppy—but I manage to
liit the headlines, and I see that
