THE SHOW-OFF.—At (he Palo j
Alto Community Theatre. April
2G, 27. 28.
I This production, along with Out
ward Bound and Ten Nights in a
Bar-Room, proves the Community
Theatre capable of a great deal 1
more than it visually exhibits. This |
production would never have been i
intelligible in a theatre larger than j
the Community House and, despite :
painstaking direction and a fine j
! tempo maintained under the direc- j
tion of the guest-star, Hamilton
Cummins, there were still a few
cast weaknesses noticeable. But, on j
, the whole, the production was not
only far above average but consist
ently rather good entertainment.
And the technical staff has at last ;
realized that its difficulties arc not i
insurmountable. The setting was 1
very good indeed.
Kelly's play is not comedy; it is
a very depressing genre picture of |
a home on the outskirts of a large !
city; it has a buffoon thrust into it j
who, although drawn out. of pro- i
i portion, is amusing. When he is |
absent, the bickerings of the family
I become first musing and then an
noying.
The Community Theatre acting
company was fortunate in having
' as capable a person to play the h:u
-' lied mother as Natalie Perham; she
had a lengthy role but was consist- j
I ently convincing. The star—whose
laugh, however demanded by the :
I author, was too heavy a farce for :
1 the small theatre—was fine. His use
! of detail in his own action and that
iof his cast was particularly satis
| factory.

Alfred Bogan did a respectable
bit as Joe and then the cast began
to weaken. Although none of the
rest were very bad they had appar
ently had less experience, a condi
tion which left them often very
stiff.
The only material objection to
Cummins' direction is his heavy
stress upon Kelly's rather common
place insertions of philosophy, arti
ficially directed to the audience
each time that they appeared.
The final performance is to be, I
believe, this evening.
