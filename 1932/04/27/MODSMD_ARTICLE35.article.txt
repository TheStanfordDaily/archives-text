# WHAT USE LANGUAGES? Schwartz Writes Answer TEACHERS' NEED GREAT
## 
### 
Of what use are modern lan- j
guagos? This oft-quoted question is '
answered by Dr. William Leonard
Schwartz, professor of Romanic |
Languages, and (wo associates, |
Lawrence A. Wilkins, of the New
York Board of Education, and Ar
thur G. Bovei, of Chicago Univer- j
sity, in an article in the April "Mod
ern Language Journal" entitled, i
"Vocational Opportunities for Stu
dents of Foreign Languages."
The majority of prominent occu- '
pations today are considered in the j
article and treated as possibilities j
for the use of languages. Teaching
and library work, state the authors, ;
are the most likely fields in which
to capitalize on a knowledge of a i
foreign tongue.
The work on this subject was au
thorized by the National Federation |
of Modern Language Teachers in
December, 1930. The authors of the j
recent article were named as a |
committee to investigate the sub
ject, Dr. Schwartz being chairman.
In the near future the article will
be published in pamphlet form, Dr. ;
Schwartz said. The magazine con
taining the Stanford professor's
writing is in the library.
