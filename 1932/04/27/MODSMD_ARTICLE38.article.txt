WASHINGTON, April 2G. 6P)—
I On his old familiar tilting ground—»
! the floor of the United States Sen
| ate —J. Thomas Heflin of Alabama
j spoke for more than five hours to
j day an impassioned plea that his
; successor, John H. Bankhead, be
j unseated.
Crowds packed the galleries and
j formed long lines outside the doors
, as Heflin asserted and reiterated
| that he had been "robbed" in the j
I'JUO election.
Late in the day spectators were 1
j cleared from the galleries as they
j applauded Heflin. it was the first ,
j time in recent history that such ac- :
j tion has been taken.
The Alabaman was given two
' hours to present his case prcpara-
I tory to a Senate vote on the con
j lest. Permitting a non-member to
| address the Senate was an unusual
1 procedure, but was accorded Heflin 1
I by a vote of 33 to 31.
