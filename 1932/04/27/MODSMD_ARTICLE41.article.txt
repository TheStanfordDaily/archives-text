# 76 TOP SCORE IN QUALIFYING ROUND OF GOLF TOURNEY
## Seaver, Hoerner Tie Hoag's Mark In Play For Championship 
### Maurice Rapf 
Dick Hoag's score of 76, made the
first day of the Stanford University
golf'tournament, still held sway last
night as the books were closed on
the qualifying round of the 1932 af
fair, with 34 entrants listed on the
scoreboard.
Although no one was able to get
under Hoag's total, which was five
over par, both Charley Seaver and
Jack Hoerner equalled the mark.
Hoerner went out badly in 40, but
came back with a nifty 36. Seaver
played on a wet course yesterday
afternoon, shooting a pair of 38's.
Three Get 77
One stroke behind this trio are
Harry Eichelberger, Tom Edwards,
and Ward Edmonds with 77's. Ed
wards seemed headed for the first
position yesterday afternoon as he
did the first nine in 37, but he
slipped to a 40 on the incoming
turn.
Thirty-one men shot under 91 to
qualify for the match play, while
Wineberg and Hunting broke even
with 92's and will play it off for the
last position in the tournament.
Pairing will be made within the
next few days, with the lirst round
encounters faking place over the
week-end.
