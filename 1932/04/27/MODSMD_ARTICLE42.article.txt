# ROBLE TOURNAMENT TO START SECOND ROUND THIS WEEK
## 
### 
With the exception of two
matches, the first round of Roble's
spring quarter tennis tournament
has been completed, and matches
in the second round will be played
off this week and next. Only one
result in the doubles tourney has
been turned in.
Those to survive their first round
matches in the singles are Elinor
Kahn, Katherine Woodward, Dot
Anne Jackson, Anne Van Wormer,
Marian Roseberry, Charlotte Gib
ner, Marjorie Buettner, Mabel
Overton, Mary Pike, Lucile Smith,
Katrina Wallingford, Elizabeth Li
lienthal, Margaret McDougall, and
Esther Pickering.
The doubles tournament seems to
be lagging behind. Evidently, if it
is difficult to get two girls together
to play a singles match, it is next
to impossible to get four girls to
gether for doubles. But one doubles
result has been turned in, Dot Anne
Jackson and Mary Pike defeating
Lucile Smith and Elizabeth Ljl icn
thal G-4, G-3.
