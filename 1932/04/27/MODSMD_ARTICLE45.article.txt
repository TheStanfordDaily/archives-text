THEY'LL GIVE Stanford all the
i way from 50 to 62 points—but not
j more without a lot of ifs.
"They" being the usual crop of
j dopesters, and the occasion being
j the approaching U.S.C. wrangle
| down at Los Angeles. Braven Dyer,
! official dopester for the Los Angeles
i Times, waxes generous and gives
I the Indians 62 1 j counters, but has
j to stretch a few points to make it.
On the opposite end of the scale
'is our own Dink Templeton, who
agrees with Charley Hunter. Olym
pic Club coach, who says Stanford
will be lucky to annex 50 tallies. The
average guess is about 55 points—
! and it takes 66 to win the meet.
.
THERE ISN'T much talk of
who will win—just a lot of
quibbling about the size of the
score. Meanwhile, a note of op
timism is heard down at the
practice oval, and it is sounded
by none other than Bill Elling
! ton, acting chief of Stanford's
track affairs.
Ellington goes so far as to
1 give the Indians a reasonable
chance to win, but qualifies his
comments with a liberal sprink
ling of the aforementioned if's.
IF Stanford can sweep the
shot and the discus, leaving
Captain Boh Hall out in the
cold; IF Ollie Amdahl can come
through to win the two-mile
grind; IF Gus Meier can wrest
eight points away from the
stellar Trojan hurdlers, which

would involve winning a first
and a second; and IF all of the
rest of the dope works out as
expected, then the genial Bill
looks for the Indians to come
out on the long end of the score, j
!
AS FOR those if's working out: i
Hall is always dangerous against
Stanford, but is a late developer
and the Farm weight men may shut
him out in both events. If the Tro
jan captain happens to be "hot,'' ;
however, he will do a lot of damage j
to the Cardinal cause.
Amdahl has shown improvement
in every meet this year and can be j
expected to give Callahan a whale :
of a battle. He may be given at j
least a 50-50 chance to break the j
tape in the "intermission" event.
The lad has intestinal fortitude. j
Meier faces perhaps the most dif- -
ficult task of all. He is up against |
some great competition, and may be :
unable to do better than a second |
and a third in the barrier events. !
On the other hand, Jimmy Payne
has been injured, which may boost ;
Meier's stock in the lows.
"The other dope" includes East- ;
man's iron man act —he is billed to
take first in the 440 and 880, and j
take the baton with several yards' ■
handicap in the last lap of the relay 1
and carry it across the finish line
first; it includes Ray's expected first
place in the javelin, and many cru
cial second and third places in the
other events.
Altogether, it looks like a long
chance. •—L.M.C.

THEY'LL GIVE Stanford all the
i way from 50 to 62 points—but not
j more without a lot of ifs.
"They" being the usual crop of
j dopesters, and the occasion being
j the approaching U.S.C. wrangle
| down at Los Angeles. Braven Dyer,
! official dopester for the Los Angeles
i Times, waxes generous and gives
I the Indians 62 1 j counters, but has
j to stretch a few points to make it.
On the opposite end of the scale
'is our own Dink Templeton, who
agrees with Charley Hunter. Olym
pic Club coach, who says Stanford
will be lucky to annex 50 tallies. The
average guess is about 55 points—
! and it takes 66 to win the meet.
.
THERE ISN'T much talk of
who will win—just a lot of
quibbling about the size of the
score. Meanwhile, a note of op
timism is heard down at the
practice oval, and it is sounded
by none other than Bill Elling
! ton, acting chief of Stanford's
track affairs.
Ellington goes so far as to
1 give the Indians a reasonable
chance to win, but qualifies his
comments with a liberal sprink
ling of the aforementioned if's.
IF Stanford can sweep the
shot and the discus, leaving
Captain Boh Hall out in the
cold; IF Ollie Amdahl can come
through to win the two-mile
grind; IF Gus Meier can wrest
eight points away from the
stellar Trojan hurdlers, which

would involve winning a first
and a second; and IF all of the
rest of the dope works out as
expected, then the genial Bill
looks for the Indians to come
out on the long end of the score, j
!
AS FOR those if's working out: i
Hall is always dangerous against
Stanford, but is a late developer
and the Farm weight men may shut
him out in both events. If the Tro
jan captain happens to be "hot,'' ;
however, he will do a lot of damage j
to the Cardinal cause.
Amdahl has shown improvement
in every meet this year and can be j
expected to give Callahan a whale :
of a battle. He may be given at j
least a 50-50 chance to break the j
tape in the "intermission" event.
The lad has intestinal fortitude. j
Meier faces perhaps the most dif- -
ficult task of all. He is up against |
some great competition, and may be :
unable to do better than a second |
and a third in the barrier events. !
On the other hand, Jimmy Payne
has been injured, which may boost ;
Meier's stock in the lows.
"The other dope" includes East- ;
man's iron man act —he is billed to
take first in the 440 and 880, and j
take the baton with several yards' ■
handicap in the last lap of the relay 1
and carry it across the finish line
first; it includes Ray's expected first
place in the javelin, and many cru
cial second and third places in the
other events.
