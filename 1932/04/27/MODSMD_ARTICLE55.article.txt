## 
### 
Bruce Fleming, captain of the
Cardinal polo team, will be unable
| to play for at least a month and 1
may possibly be out for the rest of
'the season.
Fleming suffered what is known
I in the jargon of the turf as "pulling
a jockey muscle." The injury oc- \
, curred in scrimmage Monday.
I Fortunately for the Redshirts, I
i Stanford has no hard games within j
| the next month. This Saturday
j Stanford meets Loyola University!
jof Los Angeles, bvu the Southern
; California outfit is not expected to |
j furnish much opposition.

Coach Dick Gordan is using only
two of his lirst string players
against Loyola. Rufus Spalding,
.scoring ace of the varsity, will play
at cumber four in Fleming's regu
lar place. Gillham, also first string
player will play at number two.
Parker Holt and Woody Melone,
second-string riders, will play at
number one and three. Melone, first
choice for varsity substitute, will be
handicapped by an injured leg, and
may not be able to last the whole
game.
The Loyola match will lie played
here on the Highway field at 2:30
o'clock Saturday afternoon.
