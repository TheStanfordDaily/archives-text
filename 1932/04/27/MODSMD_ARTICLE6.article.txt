### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 20. (/P) i
—Working on clues furnished by i
Mike Genova, a San Francisco bar- I
ber, a nation-wide investigation is i
under way in the expectation that j
A1 Capone will be directly linked !
with the kidnaping of the Lindbergh i
baby.
Genova is now in constant fear j
of his life and makes no move but I
that he is followed by a man as- ;
signed for the purpose of protecting
him by an international detective j
agency.
Colonel Lindbergh has been' ap- J
prised of the facts in the case, and !
it is regarded as significant here j
lhat since the last report from the |
San Francisco investigation went to j
the troubled father, A1 Capone has J
been held incommunicado pending j
negotiations for the possible release j
of the gangster on his promise to |
find the stolen child.
A youth, member of a well- i
known East Bay family, is the I
quarry sought. The youth is be- :
lieved to be a member of the gang j
that on the night of March 1 stole :
Colonel Lindbergh's baby from its ;
crib in Hopewell, N.J.
This youth is already as good as
dead, in the opinion of the detective '
agency head directing the hunt.
"I'm afraid we'll never catch up j
with him," said this man yesterday, j
