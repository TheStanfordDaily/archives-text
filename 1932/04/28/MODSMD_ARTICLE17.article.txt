Edwin Angell Cottrell, head of the
Department of Political Science, de
cried the "pork barrel politics" of
Congress in formulating an econ
omy policy for the United States.
In an interview yesterday Cottrell j
stated that a comprehensive plan J
for the introduction of necessary i
economy measures in the Federal 1
government was being held up be
cause Congressional leaders were
playing politics. "The Congressional
approach to the problem," said the
Stanford professor, "may be summed
up in the phrase 'pork barrel poli- ;
tics.'"
Dodge Measures
"Congressmen are willing to utter j
striking platitudes on the necessity
of economy in order to balance the
budget; but when the specific econ
omy measure means the closing of j

an obsolete army post or antique!
navy yard in the Congressman's j
district, then each representative J
wishes to keep his band in the 'pork
barrel,' and economy efforts are |
rendered futile."
Cottrell feels that this policy of
the national legislators has led to
the proposal for a horizontal cut in
expenditures for all the depart
ments of government.
Ignore Reports
According to Cottrell a horizontal ;
cut fails to take into consideration
ihe need of specific departments. "At
least six commissions, numerous j
departmental reports, and presiden
tial messages have informed Con- |
gross of ways to cut expenditures;
but these reports have been little
heeded. Since its election year, the j
representatives hesitate to take any
action which might endanger their j
chances of re-election," the political
scientist declared.
