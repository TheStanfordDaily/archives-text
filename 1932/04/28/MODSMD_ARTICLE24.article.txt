For failure to play off first-round
matches by the end of the week, de
linquent intramural horseshoe teams
will forfeit automatically scheduled
tourneys, according to Gene Mires,
mural manager.
The four-man teams will play the
matches on the recently renovated
horseshoe pits by the tennis court.-;
behind the band house. Mires urges
delinquent squads listed on the up
per bracket of the posted matches
on the gym bulletin board to get
in touch immediately with the
teams of the lower bracket so that
the games may be played off in
time.
