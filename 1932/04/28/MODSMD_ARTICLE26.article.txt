# TRACK SCORES REVEAL CHANGE FOR S. C. UPSET
## Giberson, Brugman, Hables Surprise With Record Marks Of Year GRAY PUTS LONG SHOT Good Practice Times Infuse New Hopes In Cards 
### Dick Strouse 
There will be an important
meeting of the entire varsity
track squad tonight immediate
ly following the Toyon smoker.
It will be held in Room lof
the Physical Education Build
ing.

i With the U.S.C. meet bat 72 hours
i away, Stanford's underdog track
i sters tore the old oval to shreds
j yesterday afternoon while showing
| the kind of fight and the kind of
i form that may upset the cocky Tro
| jan and trample him under the In
| dian's spiked heel on Saturday.
Fifty flat for Captain Alvin Hables
| in the 440, 50 feet 9 inches for Nil
| lie Gray in the shot, better than 15
j flat for both Gus Meier and "Crip
ple" Jack Brugman in the highs,
137.5 for Ralph Giberson in the 352,
24.4 for Meier in the lows with
Cotto Herbert barking right at his
| heels—those were the times and
distances of the year's best work
: out for the Cards. •
Giberson Rates First Mention
Perhaps Giberson should rate first
j mention. His time was seven-tenths
j of a second better than he has ever
| done in his life, and it shows that
j Gibey is going to be out there try
ing to take the place of Hobbling
| Les Hables. Giberson's performance
yesterday may mean that he won't
tie up in the 220 Saturday, which in
j turn may mean that S.C.'s boast of
j a shutout will be rudely shattered.
Then this Brugman person, who
supposedly trained last week in
hospital corridors, ran his finest
1 high hurdle flight and it was only
I in practice. Meier won in 14.9, and
j the finish was one of those nine
| inch affairs. And there was sup
i posed to be a big feature in today's
Daily about Welch and Carls of
• U.S.C. and their marks of 14.8!
: They're good, all right, but they've
leach done J4.8 only once this year.
Ila hies May Do 440
I The captain's fastest 1932 quarter
! mile came with a running stai't, but
! it also came with a sprinting finish,
j which is much more to the point.
Ike may sneak into that 440 down
I South and give Ablowich a nice
j fourth place, but even if he only
: runs the relay, Captain Hables' im
' proving form should take much of
j the victory-responsibility from the
; industrious shoulders of Ben East
| man.
As for Nellie Gray, the mightiest
I heave of his career means, in rela
i tion to Saturday's meet, only that
the other shot-putters will stage a
! nice little battle for second place,
i Looking ahead, 50 feet 9 inches
j means 1.C.4-A. strength for Stan
] ford and Olympic team possibilities
j for Gray.
Meier Edges Out Herbert
Meier won the lows from Herbert
lin 24.4 even though he hit three
I hurdles, but Cotto was coming up
i fast at the end and anyone who
gains on Meier in a low hurdle race
; must be given a chance in any kind
!of company. So now it's Meier,
Brugman, and Herbert instead of
| just Meier in Saturday's barrier
j events.
As was hoped when he strained a
j muscle last week, Bill Werder
i seemed completely recovered yes
terday. He did no broad-jumping,
, but ran 220's with no injurious re
i suits whatsoever.
