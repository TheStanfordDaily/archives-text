However radical and "destructive of student liberties"
il may seem at first glance, the proposed constitutional
amendment for the appointment of Men's (Council members
deserves the serious attention of all students. On paper,
;it least, it promises to be better than the present system
in two or three respects.
The tendency of the voters to elect only athletes to cam
pus posts here lias been especially marked in the case of
(his body. Too little regard has sometimes been paid to
experience, character, and personal convictions. This is a
condition which must necessarily exist to a certain extent
under any plan for popular choice, and the proposed ar
rangement gets away from it. The appointing committee
would be composed of men who know the nature of the
council's work and the type of man best fitted for it. They
would not be influenced by irrelevant considerations in
mifking a choice.
Appointment by such a group would tend to unify and
llius to strengthen the Council, a result which should be of
great importance in enforcing the Honor Code. Divergent
opinions, with ensuing irresolution, are fatal to the pursu
ance of a firm enforcement policy.
Il is essential to the success of the'disciplinary body
that it command the respect of those under its authority.
Without that respect its power would not extend beyond
the walls of the meeting room. The removal of Men's Coun
cil one step from direct student control would add to its
prestige, even if the caliber of men chosen was no higher.
"Familiarity breeds contempt" is a saying no less true be
cause of its triteness.
