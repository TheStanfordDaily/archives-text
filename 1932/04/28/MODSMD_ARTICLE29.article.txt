The students will have a chance to decide the late of the
Concert Series 'for themselves when the question of its con
tinuation is put to a special election next Tuesday.
There is no doubt but that the concerts are worthwhile
and a valuable asset to the tDiversity as they are the only
< xtra-curricular cultural advantage that the Farm has to
offer. For six years they have furnished the music-lovers
of this part of the Peninsula with high-class entertainment
at a very low cost. If they are discontinued, it will, at the
best, be several years before'such an excellent offering of
artists can be found closer than San Francisco and, even
then, at a probable increase in prices.
However, before the students vote in the affirmative, to
maintain the Series for a period of perhaps three years,
they should realize that it is possible that a certain amount
of the expenses may have to be paid out of the A.S.S.I',
fund. This vear the Series showed a large deficit. 1 here is
no absolute guarantee that it will be a money-making
proposition next year.
The Concert Series manager has prepared a budget
based on this year's income which is satisfactory even to
the extent of showing a small profit. The income this year
should certainly be a sound basis on which to compute the
receipts of the next season. However, it is not absolutely
certain and there is a chance that the A.S.S.I . may faee a
deficit from the Series as it is doing this year.
Friday Albert Denney, student manager, will present
his arguments against the maintenance ot the concerts in
the columns of the Daily. Monday Helen I'llman, Concert
Series manager, will give her side of the question. Ihe
students should read their reports carefully that they may
vole intelligently on the question next Tuesday.
