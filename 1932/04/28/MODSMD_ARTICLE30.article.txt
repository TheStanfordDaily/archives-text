# LIGHTENING HELVENSTON'S LOAD
## 
### 
Th roui>l i ;i ruling providing I hat plays proposed for
campus product ion he submitted for approval to the dra
matic council four weeks before actual presentation, the
executive committee Tuesday night moved toward insur
ing Stanford playgoers against another year of suffering
under heavy dramas unsuited for student audiences.
Where there are few who question Harold Hclvcnslon's
ability as a director, there are many who condemn him as
a selector. That may be unfair. After all, it requires con
siderable effort to sort through available plays and choose
one that will lit into Stanford's limited dramatic facilities
and still please spectators. Too much, perhaps, for any one
man.
Ifelvenston is no doubt glad to be relieved of this re
sponsibility, realizing that the interests of students can
best be served by the combined judgment of a body of
students.
Now all that remains is for the dramatic council to do
its part by making certain that it does not leave the selec
tion burden oil the shoulders of the man whose main busi
ness it is to direct.
