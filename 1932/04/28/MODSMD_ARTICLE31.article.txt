# BULL SESSION
## CAMPUS POLITICS THAT ARE 
### 
As every election impressed itself |
with its absurdity on our increas
ing disgust with the meaninglessness j
of campus politics, we turned to our j
Underwood (advt.) and pleaded for
a vitalization of student affairs. |
Yearly, the procession of candidates j
went to the polls—yearly, a small
group of students also went to the !
polls—yearly, the victorious candi- ,
dates were chosen. The difference j
between the runners for office was j
indistinguishable. Perhaps there was j
no difference.
But whenever anyone would ad- '■
vocate measures that would put life
—i.e., to say existence —into politics,
there was that cry of the entrance !
of political ballyhoo. Many shy at j
the idea of platforms, speeches up
holding those platforms—and can
didates pledged to live up to them.
It all is lumped together under the
name of "dirty politics" — and of j
course, dirty politics must never!
darken the fair name of this Uni- !
versity.
Yet while these individuals were j
throwing up their hands at open
manifestations of political activity, •
they have witnessed all the injuri- j
ous aspects of self-government. They I
have witnessed the alignment of j
groups not according to principles;
or even ideas but rather on loca-j
tion of beds. There are usually but j
two candidates running for A.S.S.U. j
prexy —one who hangs his cords i
somewhere above Portola street and j
another who hangs his cords some

where below that line.
Once in a long time, a candidate
comes along who through his
friends or enemies is able to split
the vote of the two enlarged cliques.
This is rare and transitory—the old
lineup being resumed after the mo
mentary flareup. For the lesser of
lices, this strict division is not so
strict. Imperfect organization in the
two living groups makes impossible
rigid partisanship in these contests.
A very popular athlete or a very
popular co-ed may also be able to
break this lineup. Aside from these
cases, it is for all practical purposes
impossible. We vote often without
knowing the qualifications of the
candidates—and practically always
vote without knowing their opinions
on campus issues. That so miserable
a percentage of the student body
vote is only natural and excusable.
Politics here are almost meaningless
and completely understandable for
most of us.
When Stanford organizes parties
that hang together not because of
campus residence—but because of
campus issues, then more .students
will vote; and those that do, will do
so with the opportunity of voting
intelligently. There are plenty of
campus issues—honor code, Men's
Council, 8.A.C., Union, Concert Se
ries—and many more. Why not
recognize them fairly? Why not
have parties and platforms?
