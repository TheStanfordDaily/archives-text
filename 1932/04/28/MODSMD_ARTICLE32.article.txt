TARZAN, THE API] MAN—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Nina of "Trader Horn" fame was
marvelous in her own way, but Tar
zan seems to have outdone her at
her own game. Nina learned how
(and where) to wear her clothing
from the "naked" savages, but Tar
zan seemed to have learned from
the apes. Nina was bleached a
beautiful white by the torrid Afri
can sun, while Tarzan tanned to
perfection, according to 1932 col
legiate standards. Nina learned to
speak English with an American
twang from a Spaniard, and Tarzan
could talk to all God's living crea
tures except man.
Anyway, it was swell "melo
dramer"; the men and the animals
became so mixed before the last
climax (there was a series of them)
that this reviewer was positive that
Johnny Weissmullei* was a giraffe
when he wasn't swimming. In fact
an ape stole the picture from the
Hollywoodites, just as surely as
Marie Dressier stole "Anna Chris
tie" from Greta Garbo, which proves
something or other, I guess. At least

arrange to miss the news reel and
the cartoon if you're going to see
this eighth wonder of the world—
"Tarzan, the ape gentleman."
—J.H.F.
WAY RACK HOME—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
This picture starts out with a
groan for the first minute, the sec
ond minute is one of glimmering
hope, and then the rest of the pic
ture is a corking hit.
Seth Parker and his Jonesport
neighbors, of radio fame, are far
more convincing on the screen than
we ever thought they could be.
Phillips Lord has created an
"America's grandpa" character that
not even Chick Sale could surpass.
The acting was excellent and
borne out with a surprisingly good
continuity throughout the whole
play. The story almost approaches
a thriller. There is an exciting kid
napping of an adopted son, a break
neck race between horses and
wagons, and through it all an ex
tremely good plot.
And, believe it or not, the comedy
is really good. —J.11.G.
