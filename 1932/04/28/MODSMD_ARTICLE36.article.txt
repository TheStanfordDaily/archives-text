# GERMAN STUDENT LIFE Duelling Is Campus Sport HAVING SCAR IS HONOR
## 
### 
Duelling is .fust another intra-;
mural sport at Heidelberg, accord- ,
ing to Dr. Robert C. Swain, son of
Acting-President Swain, who re- \
cently returned from Germany.
At Heidelberg they have a fra- I
ternity system similar to that here
except that the fraternities are
called "corporations." There are!
four big corporations and a number :
of smaller ones of less importance.!
To become a full-fledged member !
of one of the corporations it is!
necessary to have participated in at
least seven duels. The duels are j
generally fought between members
of different corporations and the sys- I
tem used is different than the i
French system. There is no thrust- I
ing, it is all .slashing, and the com- j
batants are not allowed to move !
about under penalty of being clis- '
qualified.
A heavy pad is strapped around j
the neck, chest, and arm. The fact
is left bare and the object is to see
which competitor can inflict the
greatest number of facial cuts.
Strange as it may seem these facial
slashes are not particularly guarded
against and a student with many of j
these scars is considered quite a I
hero.
For duels involving a point of !
honor, called "spite duels," a court
decides the details and no chest
protector is worn. Dr. Swain tells a ;
story of a member of one of the
large corporations who had fought j
a number of duels and was rather a :
bully. He purposely insulted an' i
other student's girl companion, j
whereupon her escort challenged |
the fellow to a duel with pistols
at ten paces, and the bully slunk
off "with his tail between his legs."
