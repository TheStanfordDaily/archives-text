THOUGH ONCE upon a time
il was fashionable for the young
man's fancy to turn in the spring
to golf, tennis, and OTHER
things, now we find that an
ever-increasing number turn
each spring to Harry Maloney's
soccer team.
About the only ones on the cam
u;. who think that soccer isn't an
xcellent game are the ones who
now nothing about it. To them it
■> merely kicking a basketball
round a field. But then, to the one
/ho doesn't know golf it is just
itting a pill around a cow pasture.
To the uninitiated soccer
doesn't seem very scientific, in
reality it is one of the most com
plicated games played here. Pop
Warner was once heard to re
mark that if his football players
could handle themselves as fast
and cleverly as Maloney's men
have to to get on the team he
would turn out consistently un
defeated outfits.
There is no brute force in soccer,
"he men have to be able to think
nd move swiftly at the same time,
'he soccer man has to be in posi
ion when the ball gets there, and
•e able to know what to do with it
nd d oil. But the outstanding re
uirement is TEAMWORK.
And il was by instilling team
work into liis men, that Maloney
turned out an undefeated eleven
last fall. Soccer works on the
same principle as football—
practice in the spring and play
the game in the fall. Coach IVla
loncy has built up spirit and in
terest in soccer until he had
some sixty men trying for a
position on last fall's eleven.
This spring, although track is still
oing, baseball just finishing, the
eshman eleven missing, and a lot
f seniors gone from the ranks,
lere are more than three teams
ut for practice. They work out
londays, Wednesdays, and Thurs
ays. The first hour they spend on
mdamentals ancl the second in
•rimmaging.
And out of the men who are out
lis quarter, those who will transfer
> Stanford, and those who are in
<tne other sport, Maloney will turn
ut a team that wlil probably be
ble to keep the championship for
<iother year.
It certainly looks as if the
powers that be made a clever
move when they instituted in
door baseball along with the
regular intramural spring hard
hall league.
Hardball takes a lot of practice
id a fair knowledge of the game,
ut indoor can be picked up on the
out lawn after lunch. And another
ling, the boys don't come away
oni an indoor game feeling as if
icy had been through a war.
At the rate the teams are going
lis year, and judging by the num
-■r of teams signed up for softball,
looks as if indoor would be the
ajor mural ball game next year,
id hardball merely a minor sport

It certainly looks as if the
powers that be made a clever
move when they instituted in
door baseball along with the
regular intramural spring hard
hall league.
Hardball takes a lot of practice
id a fair knowledge of the game,
ut indoor can be picked up on the
out lawn after lunch. And another
ling, the boys don't come away
oni an indoor game feeling as if
icy had been through a war.
At the rate the teams are going
lis year, and judging by the num

looks as if indoor would be the
ajor mural ball game next year,
id hardball merely a minor sport

yed-in-the-wool addicts.
THOUGH ONCE upon a time
il was fashionable for the young
man's fancy to turn in the spring
to golf, tennis, and OTHER
things, now we find that an
ever-increasing number turn
each spring to Harry Maloney's
soccer team.
About the only ones on the cam
u;. who think that soccer isn't an
xcellent game are the ones who
now nothing about it. To them it
■> merely kicking a basketball
round a field. But then, to the one
/ho doesn't know golf it is just
itting a pill around a cow pasture.
To the uninitiated soccer
doesn't seem very scientific, in
reality it is one of the most com
plicated games played here. Pop
Warner was once heard to re
mark that if his football players
could handle themselves as fast
and cleverly as Maloney's men
have to to get on the team he
would turn out consistently un
defeated outfits.
There is no brute force in soccer,
"he men have to be able to think
nd move swiftly at the same time,
'he soccer man has to be in posi
ion when the ball gets there, and
•e able to know what to do with it
nd d oil. But the outstanding re
uirement is TEAMWORK.
And il was by instilling team
work into liis men, that Maloney
turned out an undefeated eleven
last fall. Soccer works on the
same principle as football—
practice in the spring and play
the game in the fall. Coach IVla
loncy has built up spirit and in
terest in soccer until he had
some sixty men trying for a
position on last fall's eleven.
This spring, although track is still
oing, baseball just finishing, the
eshman eleven missing, and a lot
f seniors gone from the ranks,
lere are more than three teams
ut for practice. They work out
londays, Wednesdays, and Thurs
ays. The first hour they spend on
mdamentals ancl the second in
•rimmaging.
