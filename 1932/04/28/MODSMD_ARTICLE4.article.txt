# CONCERT SERIES HISTORY RETOLD
## Originated Through Efforts Of Wilfrid Davis 
### Beatrice Bishop 
; ! Originated through the persistent
' ' efforts of a student, Wilfrid Davis,
r | who felt that Stanford needed
! something musical to round out its
[ curriculum, the A.S.S.U. Concert
,! Series has been an institution on
| j the campus for the past six years.
. Whether or not it will be continued
' a seventh season will be decided by
I an all-campus vote next Tuesday.
Davis at first planned to solicit his
own financial backing, but. was
, warned against doing so by profes
sors interested in the project, so he
. I spent a year gaining the support of
| the student, body. Finally, in the
. spring of 1926, the Ex Committee
> | decided to give the plan a trial,
| ; provided that 1300 pledges for sea
' | son tickets could be secured from
j the students.
The tickets were subscribed for,
. i and the Pavilion was approved by
i Alfred Hertz, then conductor of the
r | San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
' ! as having excellent, acoustic quali-
I tics. So in the fall of 1926 Louis
I Graveure, Belgian tenor, gave the
; first concert, which was considered
| a success.
' | Wilfrid Davis, who had been
' unanimously selected as the first
j concert manager, was commended
; by the singer for his undertaking.
' J Other musicians who were heard
' ; that season included Mischa Elman,
i Victor Lichtenstein, Rosa Ponselle,
i Tito Schipa, and the San Francisco
j Symphony Orchestra.
