When the scheduled mural ball
teams clash today two of the major
battles for the intramural title will
ensue on the local diamonds.
The Breakers-Phi Kappa Sigma
game will hold the spotlight of in
terest. Both teams, strong bidders
for the mural crown and winners
in the first round oi' hard ball play,
v/ill influence greatly the question
of team power in League 111 of the
hard ball division. In the early
games the Breakers defeated the
A.K.L.'s 21 to 3, while the Phi Kaps
won from Delta Chi in a 17 to 14
victory. From the standpoint of
present speeulation the Breakers,
runners-up in last year's title race,
seem to have the edge.
Last week Sigma Chi flouted the
Sequoia I team, winners of last sea
son's championship; today the Row
men return to test the mettle of the
lEI Cuadro ball club. The eating
club was barely nosed out of a win
in the first round of play with the
Toro nine.
El Capitan Wins
Both teams losers in last week's
play, the El Capitan and the Alpha
Sig ball clubs will fight it out among
the rocks and in the holes of the
mural field in the third hard ball
game of the day.
Emblazoned by two homers for
j each team and by the work of
i Pitcher Sutou, the El Campo-Japa
; nese Club game, played yesterday
1 afternoon in the day's round of
' mural hard ball, ended in a 11 to 7
j victory for the men from Campo.
i Fisher and Walker of the eating
j club and Sutou and Nakayama of
I the Japanese outfit accounted for
I the home runs.
Pitcher Sutou Stars
! Scoring consistently, the Campo
! ball club eked out of Sutou eight
' hits to hand ihe Japanese Club their
! second loss of the season. With the
' eating club men earning most of
! their runs oft' walks and errors, Su
j tou tallied 13 strikeouts.
Ihe Alpha Delt nine advanced
| one more step yesterday on the
i league ladder with the 9-2 victory
over the Phi Sigs, winners in the
first round of play. Holding their
opponents down to a run in the
first and third innings, the Alpha
I Delts, led by S. Eastman and
\ Thompson, tallied three runs in the
first frame and four in the third to
| amble away with an early-won vic
j tory. With only six hits to their
j credit, the Alpha Delts, scored the
: majority of runs off walks and er
! rors.
I Theta Delts Routed
Going wild on a 20-iun rally in
'the first inning, the Phi Gamma
1 Delta soft ball club massacred the
Theta Delta Chi nine with a 33 to 1
! triumph to set an unofficial all
-1 time record for one-inning scoring
i flourishes. Three times around, the
! batting lineup for the Fijis battered
I the Theta Delt pitching staff in the
j first frame, then came back in the
; second to tally seven more runs. In
i the avalanche of runs in the first,
I 13 men came to bat for the Fijis
! before an out was tallied against
I them.
j The men from Delta Upsilon de
| feated the Sigma Nu team, 6 to 3,
I in the second of the soft ball games.
In a first-inning rally similar to the
;Fiji stampede, only on a smaller
[scale, the D.U.'s tallied their six
runs. Schauf scored two of the
| Sigma Nu's three runs.
