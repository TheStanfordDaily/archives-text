# WOMEN'S FORENSIC TEAM MEETS U.S.C. IN NOVEL CONTEST
## 
### 
Intercollegiate women's debating
will witness a new departure of
procedural form when the Stanford
and U.S.C. women's debate teams
meet tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
The plan of this forensic tilt is
analagous to that of the traditional
Joffro debate, in that the subject for
discussion will be given to the de
baters at 6 o'clock. The subject,
which is to be purely impromptu,
will be one on which the speakers
are equipped to speak.
This is the first debate of its kind
to be held among the women, and
success of the plan will determine
the possibility of similar meets in
the future.
