### 
As a part of the revised system
governing the fraternity situation
on the campus, the Interfraternity
Board of Control acted on the re
port of the finance committee in
conjunction with the passing of the
new rushing rules at its meeting
Wednesday night in the-Old Union.
When the Board decided to up
hold the penalty imposed on the
fraternities for illegal rushing dur
ing fall and winter quarters at its
meeting of April 12, it also passed
a resolution requiring an adequate
auditing system for each house. The
fraternities were also required to
take care of all debts or present a
satisfactory budget which would
take care of them.
Chapter Reports
Under the regulations passed
Wednesday night each chapter must
furnish the Finance Committee of
the Board with an audited report
of its condition prior to June 1,
1932. Audits made prior to that date
and since January 1, 1932, will be
accepted.
Each chapter is required to fur
nish the committee with a letter
from the auditor commenting on
the system of bookkeeping. If, in
the opinion of the auditor, the sys
tem of bookkeeping is not satisfac
tory then a statement or letter from
the house manager is required,
stating that steps have been taken
to arrange installation of a proper
system before fall quarter, 1932.

Provision was also made for pro
viding each fraternity with a memo
randum of the new program and
the requirements of the Board in
he matter.
