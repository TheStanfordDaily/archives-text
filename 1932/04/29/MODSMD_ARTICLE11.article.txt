## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, April 28. </!>)â€”
Marlcne Dietrich learned definitely
today that she is one of the great
army of the unemployed. If there
was any doubt in her mind as to the
action of Paramount it was dispelled
by the "blue envelope" mailed her
yesterday.
The star will remain ofT the pay
roll of the film company unless she
decides to return to work in the
talkie selected for her.
