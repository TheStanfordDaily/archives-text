# DENNY REPORT

### 
Editor's Note: In this official state
ment, Albert L. Denney, student
manager, gives the viewpoint of the
Student Organizations Fund con
concerning the Concert Series. In an
article Monday Helen Ullman, Con
cert Series manager, will present her
stand.
Whether or not the Concert
Series will continue to operate in
the future will depend entirely
upon the student body vote which
will be held on Tuesday, May 3d.
This year it will be necessary to
withdraw from student body re
serves approximately $1,350.00 to
meet the deficit which has resulted
from the financial operations of
this organization for the year
1931-1932. During the previous
four years of operation the Con
cert Series was unable to set aside
reserves to protect itself in ad
verse years, so that this organiza
tion has been forced to come to
the Associated Students for finan
cial aid in meeting its obligations
this year.
The financial results of the Con
cert Series for this year have been
due to adverse economic condi
tions, lack of sufficient student
support in attendance, and parti
ally to inexperience in manage
ment, which is a necessary evil in
student organizations requiring an
annual change of management.
This year, the income from the
sale of tickets has decreased $2,-
234.00 under the income for 1930-
1931, while expenditures have been
curtailed only $780.00, including a
cut of $490.00 in the amount paid
for services of the artists. The
financial future of the Concert
Series, if the students decide to
continue it, is at best very uncer
tain under present conditions. If
the series is continued during
times when the community is un
able to support it to the fullest
extent, the student funds will be
required to hear the full financial
burden• of supporting a cultural
enterprise for the benefit of the
community of Palo Alto, the Uni
versity and faculty, and the stu
dents.
However, if students desire to
continue this cultural enterprise
for the benefit of the entire com
munity with the full understanding
that all financial responsibility will
rest on student body funds, the
Concert Series unquestionably
will be continued next year.
