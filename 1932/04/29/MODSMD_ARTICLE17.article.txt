# ENGINEERS' DANCE TO OPEN WOMEN'S GYM DANCE STUDIO
## 
### 
For the first time since the
Women's Gym was built the dance
studio is to be used, for the Engi
neers' Dance tonight, it was an
nounced yesterday by Cy Thomas,
committee chairman.
Instead of the barn-like gym, with
its hoops, steel girders, and lined
floors, a room built especially for
dancing and decorated with drapes
1 and a large mirror will be the scene
of what promises to be one of the
best dances of the year.
J The floor, never used, is in ex
j cellent condition, and the ceiling is
I of sound-absorbing material which
j will make the acoustics better, ac-
I cording to Gordon Heche, whose or-
I chestra will play. In addition it is
; possible to decorate the room better,
i Engineering will be the theme of
j the decorations, model machinery
i being featured. Beautiful lighting
; effects wiil be arranged, and the re
sult will be novel as well as effec
tive, Thomas said. Even to the pro
grams the theme has been carried,
for a robot decorates the silver
cover.
In keeping with the depression,
j bids have been set at only $1.50 and
J may be obtained at the A.S.S.U.
| office. The wheels will start turning
i at 9 o'clock, the dance ending at 1
j o'clock.
