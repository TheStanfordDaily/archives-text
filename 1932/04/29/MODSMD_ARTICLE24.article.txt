# Cardinals Refuse To Concede Win In Trojan Meet
## Redshirt Prospects Hardest Hit in Sprints; Lombardi Out and Condition of Les Hables' Health Uncertain; Giberson Is Improved CONTEST WILL BE BROADCAST OVER RADIO Ben Eastman Set for Iron Man Act; Must Win Three Races to Give Indian Chance for Victory 
### DICK STROUSE 
I IKE the barking dog that doesn't know it's not supposed to bite, Stan
ford's track team is buried beneath a pile of U.S.C. points and won't
admit it's dead. Experts aver it; Troy brags of it; the Farm somewhat
sadly expects it; but (be lusty old Indian himself refuses to admit he's
beaten by a Trojan horse that at best is made of wood.
And it's this attitude of "who the hell are they, anyway?" that is going
to make Saturday's track meet a classic. It's the possibility that Stanford
can dig its way out from under that pile of points and toss the dirt in
U.S.C.'s smiling face and it's the Cards' knowledge of their real chance
to effect the impossible, that gives tomorrow's meet the glamor and
do-or-die aspect so characteristic of former Trojan-Indian battles.

Most of all Stanford's warriors
get a slight glimmer of hope from
: the "come-through" spirit that
characterized the Indians' showing
in the 1.C.4-A. meet last year.
After dropping four straight dual
meets to the Trojans, and suffering
: bad drubbings in the Fresno Relays
and California Intercollegiates, the
1931 tracksters suddenly got mad at
the annoying wooden horse from
U.S.C., and turned in one of the
most astonishing performances in
recent track history in the 1.C.4-A.
meet when, outclassed by 20 points
and with Captain Podge Smith and
Hec Dyer on the sidelines, they fin
ished less than three points behind
these same Trojans.
Stanford's pre-season promise of
favoritism in tomorrow's meet has
been hit hardest in Ihe sprints.
Frank Lombardi will definitely not
run, as he is now out of school on
a leave cf absence. But Ralph Gi
fcerson, who has never admitted he
was beaten until the race was over
.nd officially announced, and who

j has looked stronger in this week's
workouts than ever before in his
I lift-*, will bo there.
Hablcs' Condition
So will Los Hables, whose ques
tionable condition furnishes tomor
row's biggest puzzles. Les' fight
may carry his weakened body
i through to two places in the dashes
I and if by some stroke of the gods
; he is able to run his best races, he
.will subtract a neat six or eight
i points from Troy's handsome doped
! total.
Magician Ben Eastman will be
j there, already the undisputed star
| of the meet. For the first time in
I his life, Ben will be asked to run
three races in near-record time, and
the Blazer will win all three if it's
humanly possible for a mortal to do
i so.
Ben's Big Three
Eastman will have to face the
second best collegiate quarter-miler
in the country when he meets Art
Woessner; he will have to run
j within two seconds of the recognized
world's record to defeat Wehner,
Foore, and McGeah of the Trojans
in the 880; and he will probably be
asked to make up plenty of yard
age on a much fresher Woessner in
j the relay. Eastman is a champion:
i perhaps the greatest track man who
| ever lived, but he will have to sur
pa;.. even his own superb best to
morrow to lead the Indian fight.
