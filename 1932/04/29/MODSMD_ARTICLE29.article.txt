A definite stop in the right direction was taken by the
inlerlpaternity Hoard of Control by its much-needed re
vision of the rushing rules. Much of the blame for this
year's deplorable situation, resulting when the Hoard's in
vestigation brought to light the numerous and brazen in
fractions ol the rules, may be laid to the unworkabilitv of
the ancient system.
I lie new plan of holding rushing and pledging at the
first of wilder quarter and the elimination of many of the
foolish rules winch made the former rulings so ridiculous
should form a sound basis for a satisfactory system, but a
trial period * :ii be necessary before it can he definitely
pronounced a success.
However, the absurd restriction limiting the number of
freshmen that any house can pledge to ten is the one weak
cog in the Hoard's constructive program. Of course, it is
part of the penalty for next year but it is also intended for
years following, with the elastic provision that the Hoard
may change the number as il sees fit.
I his measure is unfair both to Ihe houses and to the
froslunen. It unjustly penalizes the fraternities who need
a large class because of graduation or other reasons and it
discriminates against the freshmen by permitting only a
certain number to go a house when the fraternities might
be able to accommodate more who wish to join.
I lie ruling stabilizes the strong houses and makes the
position of the weaker ones more hazardous for, with only
ten bids being sent in to the lawyers, the latter will have
to do much of their pledging after the regular day.
Also the housing facilities on the campus are very lim
iled and holding down the number of freshmen that may
join a fraternity will not help the situation.
After next fall the Hoard would do well to remove this
useless restriction entirelv.
