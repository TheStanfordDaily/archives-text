Stanford's I!W2 track team goes up against its crucial
(est tomorrow in the under-dog position. Some Southern
California "experts" are predicting a bloody slaughter of
lite Indians, figuring I.S.C. for 90 to KM) points.
It sounds very sad; what can any ordinary team do
against \\ ykofl', Payne. Carls, Ilalstead, Van Osdel, Rarber,
(iraber, el al? But at the same time, there are a few athletes
wearing Stanford colors who are not so bad. One Hen
Fast man can crack a few records himself, while Messrs.
Laborde, Jones, Gray, and Lyman, are very fair performers
in the weight events. Augustus Meier, William Miller, Olaf
Amdahl, Akin Hay, and Wiiliam Werder are other names
which can be mentioned in this connection.
Veteran campus fans still remember the H>2 ( .) Trojan
meet, when Ward Edmonds and Alex McKinnon led an in
spired Indian team to victory over a threatening S.C. outfit
alter upsets in early events had apparently shattered Stan
ford's chances. It is this sort of fight that is likely to show
up this time and provide a serious shock to Dean Crom
well's joyous troop. Stanford may not win; the odds are
against it, but one thing is certain; there will be no walk
away in Olympic Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
