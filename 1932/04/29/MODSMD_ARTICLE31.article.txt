# SMOKE AND FIRE
## 
### 
Five Stanford professors rallied to the defense of the
most famous graduate of their university recently by draw
ing up a screaming public protest against the perpetrators
of the lately published but already notorious book, "The
Strange Career of Mr. Hoover; ruder Two Flags."
True, the volume is obviously a malicious political at
tack on the President. But it is also a shrewd financial coup
on the purl of its publisher, Samuel Roth, alias William
Fargo, who 1., d already served a term in prison for selling
obscene literature. This timely Hoover slander, he realized,
would, because of its very sensationalism, become exceed
ingly popular among the persons of this country who sel
dom think; and that, admittedly, means most of them.
The professors who protested so vigorously admitted
the cleverness of the idea, the cleverness of attacking a man
so busy ;it the helm of this country, so dignified in such a
position that he would hardly be able to retaliate through
denial or suit for libel.
"People w ill say, 'Where there is smoke there is fire,' "
they argued, "and it I looser stooped to answer or condemn,
citizens would begin to think there might be some truth in
this warped biography, so-called."
Ah, but have not these professors, in their very denun
ciation of the book, played squarely into the filthy hands
of Samuel Roth? lias not the further publicity given
the volume through their vehement, even though justified,
eoiidemnation' raised a smoke not unlike the one that
would have followed a rebuttal by Hoover himself, a smoke
that will set more citizens to reading Roth's book and to
wondering it", after all, there really is a hit of flame under
it somewhere?
