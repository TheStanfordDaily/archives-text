# BULL SESSION
## FAME BY DEVIOUS PATHS 
### 
The desire for fame has driven
men and women across the Atlantic j
(both ways), into blackest Africa, |
to whitest Antarctica, and into that J
sin Wll, Hollywood—yet it falls un
expectedly and without a struggle'
into the lap of your scribe. Some
yearbook whips down.at U. C. L. A. j
conceived a brilliant notion of re- j
naming me, re-nationalizing me—
turning their presses for several ;
hours—and presto, I find myself'
President of the Filipino Bruin Club. ;
It was a bit sudden. Not having j
worked up from the ranks of ordi- j
nary membership, the Presidency j
hurled at me in this fashion leaves j
me inclining towards the speechless
and not a little overcome. Over
burdened by the tremendous respon- j
sibilities of the office, I have been j
unable to do anything for the Club
as yet. This do-nothing policy has !
been furthered by my inability to |
date to get my hands on the Club '
funds. After all, without funds, my !
honor becomes an empty shell (very
empty)—a mere transitory illusion
of genuine power.
My parents have given me a name i
which few can pronounce and fewer
yet can spell. After years of patient
toil, I mastered it. I can remember,
like today, the flush of joy and the
sweet tears of happiness which
trickled down my harrowed face
several years ago when for the first .
time I was able to spell my full

name from MEMORY.
But cruel and inconsiderate—sav- i
, age and brutal—these U. C. L. A.
' writers have given me a new and
! even more difficult cognomen—"PA
CIFICIO MAGNIONG." A kind of
; desolate desolation creeps over my
inner being as 1 realize that with i
my plastic age passed and my years j
advanced 1 probably never will ever :
learn to spell this new name. Feel- j
; ing sure that an attempt to pro- i
j nounce it would result in the cutting
i of my tongue into a thousand bleed- I
i ing bits on my sharp incisors, I shall j
j never try.
I
I But enough of this petty moaning J
! over details. The question is to de
cide who is more honored—the Fili- !
. pinos or myself. A vote by the new j
; executive office declares the advan
tage to lie with the Islanders. Asked j
, by the press for my policy, the Pres- J
idcnt states: "Independence for the |
; Philippines—now and forever." Work j
' for hobby; salaries for all. And the j
! creation of a great Philippine Em- \
pire with branches in the leading |
' cities.
I have burdened the Bull Session I
I with a personal situation today be- I
| cause when in later years I am a \
candidate for the Presidency of the |
U. S., or assistant-dogcatcher of
Beverley Hills—never will I let it
!be said that I curried favor with •
any racial group — especially one i
with so few votes as the Filipinos, j
—Abe Mellinkoff.

President of the Filipino Bruin Club. ;
It was a bit sudden. Not having j
worked up from the ranks of ordi- j
nary membership, the Presidency j
hurled at me in this fashion leaves j
me inclining towards the speechless
and not a little overcome. Over
burdened by the tremendous respon- j
sibilities of the office, I have been j
unable to do anything for the Club
as yet. This do-nothing policy has !
been furthered by my inability to |
date to get my hands on the Club '
funds. After all, without funds, my !
honor becomes an empty shell (very
empty)—a mere transitory illusion
of genuine power.
My parents have given me a name i
which few can pronounce and fewer
yet can spell. After years of patient
toil, I mastered it. I can remember,
like today, the flush of joy and the
sweet tears of happiness which
trickled down my harrowed face
several years ago when for the first .
time I was able to spell my full

name from MEMORY.
But cruel and inconsiderate—sav- i
, age and brutal—these U. C. L. A.
' writers have given me a new and
! even more difficult cognomen—"PA
CIFICIO MAGNIONG." A kind of
; desolate desolation creeps over my
inner being as 1 realize that with i
my plastic age passed and my years j
advanced 1 probably never will ever :
learn to spell this new name. Feel- j
; ing sure that an attempt to pro- i
j nounce it would result in the cutting
i of my tongue into a thousand bleed- I
i ing bits on my sharp incisors, I shall j
j never try.
I
I But enough of this petty moaning J
! over details. The question is to de
cide who is more honored—the Fili- !
. pinos or myself. A vote by the new j
; executive office declares the advan
tage to lie with the Islanders. Asked j
, by the press for my policy, the Pres- J
idcnt states: "Independence for the |
; Philippines—now and forever." Work j
' for hobby; salaries for all. And the j
! creation of a great Philippine Em- \
pire with branches in the leading |
' cities.
I have burdened the Bull Session I
I with a personal situation today be- I
| cause when in later years I am a \
candidate for the Presidency of the |
U. S., or assistant-dogcatcher of
Beverley Hills—never will I let it
!be said that I curried favor with •
any racial group — especially one i
with so few votes as the Filipinos, j
—Abe Mellinkoff.
The desire for fame has driven
men and women across the Atlantic j
(both ways), into blackest Africa, |
to whitest Antarctica, and into that J
sin Wll, Hollywood—yet it falls un
expectedly and without a struggle'
into the lap of your scribe. Some
yearbook whips down.at U. C. L. A. j
conceived a brilliant notion of re- j
naming me, re-nationalizing me—
turning their presses for several ;
hours—and presto, I find myself'
