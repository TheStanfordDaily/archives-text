i MARY'S NECK—By Booth Ta;k
ington. Douhleday, Doran, and I
J Co. $2.50.
If you expect to find that this !
| tale by Booth Tarkington is about j
I a particular portion of a young j
i lady's anatomy, you will be disap- j
pointed. "Mary's Neck" happens to i
i be the name of a geographical lo- j
cality in Maine. However, this slight I
! deception on the part of the author j
! does not prevent this from being j
I the kind of a book you will want
i to read twice.
In this, his first novel in some
i time, Booth Tarkington displays all i
j of the humor and human insight for !
| which he has so long been famous, j
' It is the story of the experiences of i
j the Massey family, a typical Middle
i western family, and their life in
| New England, to which the father
j has been lured by socially-minded
I mother and daughter. The contrast j
! between the West and the East is
j presented in deftly drawn carica
j lures; the author is impartially dis
' cerning in both cases.
Though much fun is provided by
■ ihe various inventions to which Mr. j
j IViassey falls victim, the greatest ;
j humor of the book is provided by j
; the antics of the adolescents. And,
j being Tarkington, the author does
I this inimitably. In fact, the whole
| book is inimitable, full of fun and ■
novelty. ■—E.C.

i By Anne Fisher. Illustrations by !
Albert McKibben. W. T. Lee Co., j
Inc., Monterey, California, 19112.
(At the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
This crazy little book is all about j
Fleeta Dare, daughter of Washing- j
ton's biggest bootlegger, and what j
her brains lead her to do. She has i
! red hair and the mind of a monkey !
i out to see life.
The heroine necks her way
I through a quarter at college, runs
j her father's business when he
! breaks his legs, starts a bootleggers'
I college, organizes a dude ranch
! when sent West to keep out of rnis
j chief, and winds up by marrying
i the senator who is her father's best
; customer. Through all runs a vein
j of very gentle satire on most of the
I institutions of this great country.
Very frothy, and just the sort of
i thing to read when you want to (
' give your brain a rest. The illustra
; tions are in the John Held, Jr.,
manner. —F.J.
THE STORY OF JULIAN—By Su
san Ertz. D. Appleton &. Co.
I dug down deep into my frayed
collegiate pocket to get the seventy
five cents necessary to purchase
Susan Ertz's latest—"The Story of |
Julian." After "Madame Claire," 1
which was delightful, and "Now
East, Now West," which was excel
lent, and "The Galaxy," which was
I superb, I had a right to expect j
! something unusual and interesting
j and worthwhile.
Alas for my fond hopes! Instead
I of the consistently penetrating and
; kindly character - portraiture of 1
i "Madame Claire," there were to be

found a few mildly interesting and
erratically charming characters,
sketched by one whose powers of
! perception and understanding were
| certainly less than those of the
| promising author of "Now East,
: Now West."
The book is misnamed. It is not
j the story of Julian. It is a series of
I incidents in the lives of three mod
l ern English families who occupy
| neighboring country-houses on a
i lai'ge estate. Perhaps the most
j charming character, and certainly
the one most reminiscent .of the
| unforgettable Laura of "The Gal
; axy," is Pauline Trellett, the young
| novelist who is in love with Julian's
j father.
Pray do not misunderstand. The
book is worth reading. Susan Ertz
has a sanity, a quiet skillfulness in
i all that she writes that is refresh
j ing; while she does not lack the
I modern view-point or the beauty
j of phrasing that makes writing lit
i erature. —E.L.S.

This crazy little book is all about j
Fleeta Dare, daughter of Washing- j
ton's biggest bootlegger, and what j
her brains lead her to do. She has i
! red hair and the mind of a monkey !
i out to see life.
The heroine necks her way
I through a quarter at college, runs
j her father's business when he
! breaks his legs, starts a bootleggers'
I college, organizes a dude ranch
! when sent West to keep out of rnis
j chief, and winds up by marrying
i the senator who is her father's best
; customer. Through all runs a vein
j of very gentle satire on most of the
I institutions of this great country.
Very frothy, and just the sort of

THE STORY OF JULIAN—By Su
san Ertz. D. Appleton &. Co.
I dug down deep into my frayed
collegiate pocket to get the seventy
five cents necessary to purchase
Susan Ertz's latest—"The Story of |
Julian." After "Madame Claire," 1
which was delightful, and "Now
East, Now West," which was excel
lent, and "The Galaxy," which was
I superb, I had a right to expect j
! something unusual and interesting
j and worthwhile.
Alas for my fond hopes! Instead
I of the consistently penetrating and
; kindly character - portraiture of 1
i "Madame Claire," there were to be

found a few mildly interesting and
erratically charming characters,
sketched by one whose powers of
! perception and understanding were
| certainly less than those of the
| promising author of "Now East,
: Now West."
The book is misnamed. It is not
j the story of Julian. It is a series of
I incidents in the lives of three mod
l ern English families who occupy
| neighboring country-houses on a
i lai'ge estate. Perhaps the most
j charming character, and certainly
the one most reminiscent .of the
| unforgettable Laura of "The Gal
; axy," is Pauline Trellett, the young
| novelist who is in love with Julian's
j father.
Pray do not misunderstand. The
book is worth reading. Susan Ertz
has a sanity, a quiet skillfulness in
i all that she writes that is refresh
j ing; while she does not lack the
I modern view-point or the beauty
j of phrasing that makes writing lit
i erature. —E.L.S.
i MARY'S NECK—By Booth Ta;k

J Co. $2.50.
If you expect to find that this !
| tale by Booth Tarkington is about j
I a particular portion of a young j
i lady's anatomy, you will be disap- j
pointed. "Mary's Neck" happens to i
i be the name of a geographical lo- j
cality in Maine. However, this slight I
! deception on the part of the author j
! does not prevent this from being j
I the kind of a book you will want
i to read twice.
In this, his first novel in some
i time, Booth Tarkington displays all i
j of the humor and human insight for !
| which he has so long been famous, j
' It is the story of the experiences of i
j the Massey family, a typical Middle
i western family, and their life in
| New England, to which the father
j has been lured by socially-minded
I mother and daughter. The contrast j
! between the West and the East is
j presented in deftly drawn carica
j lures; the author is impartially dis
' cerning in both cases.
Though much fun is provided by
■ ihe various inventions to which Mr. j
