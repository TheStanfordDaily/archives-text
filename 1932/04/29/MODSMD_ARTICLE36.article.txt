dcre pals we arc not quite sure
about spelling here in the ussr
and as for punctuation they have
not reached the point of decid
ing whether you should be exiled
to the coldest part of Siberia or
just thrown to the polar bears
without further ado so we arent
faking any chances
on account of we would like to
punctuate our own life in a more
suitable manner with many news
reel photographers on deck to show
how the only person the Stanford
campus ever thought little enough
of to send him around the world to
get rid of him died that is com
plicated but you get the general
idea
of all the places we have visited
so far china has it way over any
body else on account of it is big
enough to get lost in partly but
mostly because it is so dirty we
could act normal and not worry
about what people thought of us
nobody thinks there anyway
chinas biggest export is coo
lies nobody knows when or
where theyre shipped out but
suddenly you see them sprout
ing up in out of the way places
they also grow suey which is
something like sugar cane only
different as it has a louder voice
and they have big crews of
people working all the time to
cut it and ship it they work on

a competitive basis and there is
a tinier just like at a track meet
and when everybody gets ready
to work the tinier yells CHOI*
SUEY and then the fun begins j
getting back to Vladivostok how- j
ever and that is not as simple as
it sounds we have,* spent a good -
part of today trying to think of a j
good pun on that swell name but i
there arent any of course you know
the citys snobbish motto is Vladi
vostok that you want now spend I
the rest of the morning figuring that
out \
we hoped to get over in tip*
center of things and see the
birthplace of the vodka boat
song but asia is taking too much
time and so we'll tell you about
it in the episode labeled gerinan
beer gardens the effect is the
same except that in russia they
have natural refrigeration just
like natural gas and so you get
pretzels thrown in for nothing
the choice morsel of the day is j
saved up for last being in the na- i
ture of an astounding stop the
presses discovery
you always thought castanets I
we re an accessory to spanish danc- j
ing didnt you well that is where :
youve made an awful mistake be- I
cause they started in the land of .
the .steppes which is a great place j
for evolution
the idea is that the gutta fish i
are very plentiful in the water 1
if you can get through the ice I
they are adept at that very
pastime you see they concen- ;
trate and a hole opens up in the j
ice and then the little gutta
percha on the edge of the hole
and practice scales
the fishermen meanwhile sneak i
up on them and castanet shouting
loudly at the same time and the !
gutta think that it is applause and j
well you can see how it would be j

so far china has it way over any
body else on account of it is big

mostly because it is so dirty we

they also grow suey which is
something like sugar cane only

and they have big crews of
people working all the time to
cut it and ship it they work on

a competitive basis and there is
a tinier just like at a track meet

to work the tinier yells CHOI*
SUEY and then the fun begins j

song but asia is taking too much
time and so we'll tell you about
it in the episode labeled gerinan
beer gardens the effect is the
