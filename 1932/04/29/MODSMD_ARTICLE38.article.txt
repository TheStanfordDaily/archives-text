## ZIMANSKY'S IRISH ROSE 
### 
The Editor, Sir: »
Your editorial this morning on
Mr. Helveriston's choice of plays, !
{iside from being in poor taste,:
seems to have required a good deal \
of imagination. ' Romeo and Juliet" i
appears to be the selection espe- ;
cjally objected to. probably on the
grounds that it was written several
centuries ago. Monday you admit- ■
ted that the play was very favor- ,
ably received, and then went on to j
speculate how much greater would
have been the applause had the se- |
lection been "Abie's Irish Rose" or
"The Cat and The Canary"; this }
morning, however, you will not
even admit that the play was well
received, and speak of the audience
as "suffering under heavy dramas I
unsuited for student audiences." 1
do not recall that the audience suf
fered.
Further, you seem to forget that j
the majority of the plays recently j
presented have been of the light J
comedy type that you so much pre
fer. No one could object to "Bird
in Hand" and "The Mistress of ;
Briony" on the grounds that these
offerings were ponderous, ancient,
and far above the level of intelli
gence of student audiences. Also, it :
might be well to consider Ihat j
"Wings Over Europe" and "Berke- '
ley Square" (which, in your cata
logue, are certainly listed as heavy
and unsuitable), together- with the
abhorred "Romeo and Juliet," drew
better houses and more applause
than plays in a lighter vein, to
which you seem to be attached.

Perhaps it is your carefully con
sidered opinion that the students
are unable to appreciate anything
above the level of the Gaieties; but
somehow the facts do not bear thb
out.
In view of the success of Mr. Hel
venston's selections, it is a trifle
unfair to condemn him and attempt
to draw him in a direction which,
judging from results, has proved
unprofitable. True, in the case
of "Mrs. Bumpstead-Leight" and
"The Mistress of Briony" the choice
might have been better, but not be
cause the offerings in question were
too heavy, aged, etc.
You claim that "Romeo and Ju
liet." which called forth your abuse,
is far from being one of Shake
speare's best plays, and that it was
cut in an unintelligible manner.
Since opinions differ, it would be
