WELL, WHAT'S thr* Rood word?"
1 Man Dope wanted to know as
dropped in on him at his hos
able home last night.
Dunno," we replied. "That's for
i to say. You didn't seem very
•ited about Stanford's chances
er the California meet —have you
1 any reason to change your
id?"
Well, yes and no," the venerable
jester said as he filled tall glasses
ich soon developed an inviting
st on the outside. "Yes and no."
"he cool mixture occupied our at
tion for a minute. "Just what,"
queried the old man, "do you
an by that?"
It's this way. I have been keep
ail eye on Stanford this last
ek, and it is a wholly different
in which will go to Los Angeles
n the one which went to Berk
y. But the trouble is, there's a
erent team to be met down
it h."
HE REDUCED the level of the
iquid in his glass, and reiter
ted, "Yes, those Trojans con
titute quite a different propo
ition than ri i d California's
tears."
"Have we a chance at all?"
t'c put in between sips.
"It's like Bill Ellington said
lie other day—Stanford can win
F a lot of things work out, but
L looks as if too many if's were
lvolved. There arc too many
Ps even on the basis of the rec
rds made so far this season by
he Trojans." >,
"How come?"
"Well, I mean that I don't
hink Cromwell has exposed the
nil strength of his team yet—
ot by quite a bit. Even if Am
ahl„ Meier, and the rest come
hrough with those extra points,
here is just as much chance
iiat U.S.C. will make up for it
i other directions."
HOW ABOUT the shcore?"
I'd give Stanford about 50 points,
it's a fairly conshervative esti
ie. Now of course, if some of
se if's involving the Hables
thers, Meier, Gibei'son and the
iy work out, almosht anything
happen."
Shpeaking of the relay, do you
lk Eastman can win it after run
g t?o rashes?"
Ben will win the quarter and
haff awright, but I wunnent give
i more than a 50-50 chanse in the
iy. Remember, he'll hav a handi
to make up, besides being tired."
Shtop! Deshist! You're makin'
feel terrible."
Aw, I'm shorry. One more of
se will fix .you up. Anyway, I've
n painting the dark shide of the
ver lining. Those shpirits the
sh have been showing may carry

1 Man Dope wanted to know as
dropped in on him at his hos
able home last night.
Dunno," we replied. "That's for
i to say. You didn't seem very
•ited about Stanford's chances
er the California meet —have you
1 any reason to change your
id?"
Well, yes and no," the venerable
jester said as he filled tall glasses
ich soon developed an inviting
st on the outside. "Yes and no."
"he cool mixture occupied our at
tion for a minute. "Just what,"
queried the old man, "do you
an by that?"
It's this way. I have been keep
ail eye on Stanford this last
ek, and it is a wholly different
in which will go to Los Angeles
n the one which went to Berk
y. But the trouble is, there's a
erent team to be met down
it h."
HE REDUCED the level of the
iquid in his glass, and reiter
ted, "Yes, those Trojans con
titute quite a different propo
ition than ri i d California's
tears."
"Have we a chance at all?"
t'c put in between sips.
"It's like Bill Ellington said
lie other day—Stanford can win
F a lot of things work out, but
L looks as if too many if's were
lvolved. There arc too many
Ps even on the basis of the rec
rds made so far this season by
he Trojans." >,
"How come?"
"Well, I mean that I don't
hink Cromwell has exposed the
nil strength of his team yet—
ot by quite a bit. Even if Am
ahl„ Meier, and the rest come
hrough with those extra points,
here is just as much chance
iiat U.S.C. will make up for it
i other directions."
HOW ABOUT the shcore?"
I'd give Stanford about 50 points,
it's a fairly conshervative esti
ie. Now of course, if some of
se if's involving the Hables
thers, Meier, Gibei'son and the
iy work out, almosht anything
happen."
Shpeaking of the relay, do you
lk Eastman can win it after run
g t?o rashes?"
Ben will win the quarter and
haff awright, but I wunnent give
i more than a 50-50 chanse in the
iy. Remember, he'll hav a handi
to make up, besides being tired."
Shtop! Deshist! You're makin'
feel terrible."
Aw, I'm shorry. One more of
se will fix .you up. Anyway, I've
