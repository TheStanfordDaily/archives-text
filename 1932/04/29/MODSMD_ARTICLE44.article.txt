(Editor's Note: This is the first of a
series of articles on the Tenth
Olympic Games to be held in Los
Angeles this year.)
It's a far cry this year, from the
1920 and 1924 . Olympic Games held
m Antwerp and Paris where Ameri
can athletes ran wild in track and
field point scores, mopping up all
opposition, but it takes an even
stronger medium's crystal to recall
the historic revival of the Olympic
Games in 1886, when the American
Olympic team travelled to Athens
and won all but a few first places.
1928 Olympics
Each Olympiad since 1896 has
brought victory to the United States
squad, but the margin of victory
has decreased with every renewal
of the classic competition. In 1928,
toreign athletes presented their most
serious threat to American suprem
acy. Ray Barbutti, running all the
way on the inside lane, plowed
through the muddy Amsterdam
track to win the quarter-mile from
Johnny Ball of Canada by less than
a foot. Barbutti's hairbreath win
was the only running victory scored
by American athletes, although
American shot-putters, high-jump
ers, broad-jumpers, and pole-vault -
ers won their respective events.
Foreign Threat
This year the foreign threat looms
more serious than ever before. In
every event some outstanding for
eign athlete has turned in marks
equal to, or better, than the Ameri
can records for that phase of com
petition. Although Frankie Wykoff
stands head and shoulders, and more
particularly legs, above all' other
American sprinters, what will he be
able to do against the FOURTEEN
German sprinters who have tied, or
bettered unofficially, the world's
l'ecord of 10.4 seconds for the 100-
meter dash? And even Ben East
man's undeniable greatness in the
440-yard run will be far from safe
from the attack of Harold Ramp
ling, English champion, who made
up forty-five yards in the last lap
of the England-Germany mile relay
race, to cover the distance in 46.4
seconds.
Rampling is perhaps the most-lo
be-feared foreign athlete, for the
very reason that he comes from a
long line of English middle-distance
runners who will not be beaten.

Gene Venzee's 4 minute, 10 second
, mile run looks good until one con
siders the brilliant times of Larva
and Purje of Finland, and Rafael
Ahmed, the Indian, who raced four
1 laps in 4 minutes, 8 seconds. Above
1500 meters, American athletes will
be completely outclassed.
Hurdlers
| Foreign hurdlers seem to be just
1 as good as ever, and it must be
remembered that there were no
American runners breaking the tape
in the Amsterdam races over the
! 110 meter and 400 meter distances.
! Even the American field event
I supremacy seems very insecure
! when the marks of foreign athletes
1 are considered. Nambu, the Japa
nese, holds the world's broad-jump
record, and the next best broad
i jumper is Silvio Cator, of Haiti. Oda
, brings Japan another world's rec
! ord in the hop-step-and-jump.
j Simeon Toribio of the Philippines
| took fourth, in the 1928 high-jump
competition, and has since then
jumped 6 feet, 7% inches. German
i and Hungarian discus throwers have
I also bettered the records of Ameri
' can champions, while the ability of
j Finnish and Middle European jave-
I lin throwers is traditional.
