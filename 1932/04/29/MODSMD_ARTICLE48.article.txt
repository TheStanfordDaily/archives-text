# MALONEY NAMES HEADS OF CLASS SOCCER TEAMS
## Freshmen To Tangle With Sophomores In Opening Game, May 9 
### 
With the annual interclass soccer
games scheduled for May 9, 11, 18,
and 18, Coach Harry Maloney an
nounces that the class captains will
be: Wadsworth White, '35, Carl
Knecht, '34, Erwin Brekelbaum, '33,
and Karl Falk, '32.
The schedule brings the freshmen
against the sophomores on the
opening day, seniors vs. juniors on
the eleventh, the winners the fol
lowing Monday, and a consolation
game for the losers on Wednesday,
May 18.
Seniors Favored
On the basis of team play, experi
ence, and confidence, the seniors
should be favored, but with the
spirit shown by other teams, the
past masters may have their hands
full when they try to walk off with
the soccer points that go toward the
interclass championship.
The fourth-year men will have
such stars in their lineup as: Cap
tain Karl Falk, leader of the cham
pionship aggregation; "Buster"
Holmes, all-conference fullback;
Preston Plumb and Emmet Hayes,
halfbacks; Bill Mearns, Jimmia
Bednar, and Paul Burks, foi'wards;
and Mai Williams, goalie.
Juniors Have Stars
The juniors will have two men
from the all-conference selections
in Brekelbaum, fullback, and Cap
tain-elect Johnnie Moore, halfback,
if he is in shape to play.
From the sophomore line-up tho
outstanding play may be expected
from center-forward Art Hearn and
outside-left Carl Knecht, as well
as halfback Alex Spoehr.
Freshmen Well Balanced
The freshmen, however, should
present the best balanced team, in
as much as they are the only ones
who have played together as a
team in competition. The yearlings
had a fine defensive team last fail,
and probably would have shown up
better in the Bear Cub series if
they had had more time to become
acquainted with the game. With
the added experience already
gained this spring, they should more
than take up where they left off
during the fall season.
Fans who are looking forward to
future varsities will do well to
watch the play of Captain White,
Kennedy, and Branch, halfbacks,
Steele, fullback, and Rojas and
Emerick, forwards.

The fourth-year men will have
such stars in their lineup as: Cap
tain Karl Falk, leader of the cham
pionship aggregation; "Buster"
Holmes, all-conference fullback;
Preston Plumb and Emmet Hayes,
halfbacks; Bill Mearns, Jimmia
Bednar, and Paul Burks, foi'wards;
and Mai Williams, goalie.
Juniors Have Stars
The juniors will have two men
from the all-conference selections
in Brekelbaum, fullback, and Cap
tain-elect Johnnie Moore, halfback,
if he is in shape to play.
From the sophomore line-up tho
outstanding play may be expected
from center-forward Art Hearn and
outside-left Carl Knecht, as well
as halfback Alex Spoehr.
Freshmen Well Balanced
The freshmen, however, should
present the best balanced team, in
as much as they are the only ones
who have played together as a
team in competition. The yearlings
had a fine defensive team last fail,
and probably would have shown up
better in the Bear Cub series if
they had had more time to become
acquainted with the game. With
the added experience already
gained this spring, they should more
than take up where they left off
during the fall season.
Fans who are looking forward to
future varsities will do well to
watch the play of Captain White,
Kennedy, and Branch, halfbacks,
Steele, fullback, and Rojas and
Emerick, forwards.
