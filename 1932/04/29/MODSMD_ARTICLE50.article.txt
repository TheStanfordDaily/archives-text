PHILADELPHIA, April 23. (/P)â€”
With 3,000 college and high-school :
athletes converging on Philadelphia j
for the. two-day University of j
Pennsylvania relay carnival, in- i
juries today began taking their toll '
of the entrants.
Holy Cross College, Worcester, j
Mass., wired that because of an in- j
jury to an athlete, it would not be !
able to participate in the American
Intercollegiate one-mile champion
ship and the University of Chicago j
withdrew for a similar reason.
Many of the athletes entered from
500 schools are expected to partici
pate in the Olympic Games at Los ;
Angeles this summer. Track fol- j
lowers look for a general slashing I
of records during the two days of j
competition, beginning tomorrow. |

Before sundown tomorrow a new j
decathlon champion will be
crowned, for Barney Berlinger. j
Penn's champion for the last three ]
years and holder of the Sullivan j
award for 1931, has been graduated.
The cream of collegiate runners i
will be seen in action in the quar
ter-mile college relay championship
of America. Schoolboy athletes will
start their three-ring carnival from
which new records and new title- i
holders are expected to emerge.
