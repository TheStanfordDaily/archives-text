# FROSH SWIMMERS SWAMP GALILEANS WITH 59-14 SCORE
## Card Babes Take All Firsts, Place Double In Every Race But One 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton's freshman
swimming team again proved that
it is one of the classiest in the
country yesterday when it swamped
Galileo High School 59 to 14. The
Indian yearlings took every first,
and placed two men in every event
except the backstroke. Bill Rogers,
star Indian backstroke man, was
not entered in the race, and Galileo
copped both second and third.
Especially good records were
hung up in the 75-yard medley re
lay and the 150-yard six-man relay.
With Rogers swimming backstroke,
Olds breaststroke, and Hirsch free
style, the Stanford tankmen cov
ered three lengths of the pool in
35.4 seconds, three tenths of a sec
ond faster than the NCS high school
record.
