# Cards Favored Over Loyola Polo Outfit
## Over-Confidence of Card Team After Winning Coast Championship May Bring Unexpected Upset 
### BY BILL MYERS 
I\ OPED as heavy favorites in tomorrow's match with Loyola University,
Stanford's polo team still stands several chances of an upset.
Over-confidence looms as one of the darkest clouds on the horizon.
Since snagging the Coast Low-Goal championship last week, it is natural
to expect that any team would be tempted to coast along for awhile on
their past honors.
Captain Bruce Fleming, star of the tournament finals at Bcresford,
will he definitely out of the line-up with a pulled jockey muscle. While
Coach (Jordan was not planning on starting Fleming in this game anyway,
lie would have been kept Ln reserve's

in case of an emergency.
Spalding Shifted
Scoring possibilities will be cut
down considerably by shifting Rut'us
Spalding to Fleming's place at num
ber four. Spalding is by far the most
accurate shooter on the team. At the
back position his opportunities to j
chalk up any tallies will be very few. j
Peter Lewis, a hard-riding and ,
brilliant defensive player will not i
Start the game, although he will be j
kept on hand as a substitute. The
big burden of staving off the Loyola !
forwards will then fall on Spalding,
who is inexperienced at the back
position. Practicing with the B
squad yesterday afternoon, Spalding
showed up well, but it still remains j
to be seen what he can do against |
really fast opposition.
Meager Reports
Another thing that may stop to
morrow's game from being anything
of a walk-away is that the meager
reports of the Loyola outfit have all
.spoken disparingly of the ability of
the Los Angeles outfit. Loyola has
played none of the same teams that
Stanford has, and as a result there :
is no real basis of comparison. There J
is more than a remote chance that j
the southern California riders may |
far outclass the Cards.
Play starts at 2:30 tomorrow after- j
noon on the Highway field.
The line-ups:
Stanford Position Loyola :
Holt 1 Schneider |
Gillham 2 Pagnette j
Melone 3 Logell j
Spalding 4 Luecke j
Stanford substitutes — Boyles,
Lewis.
