### 
Debating the subject, "Resolved,
that sororities should be abolished
from our universities," Mary Rechif
and Lucille Smith of Stanford met
Celeste Strack and Phyllis Norton
of U.S.C. last night in the first ex
temporaneous \vomen's debate held
at Stanford.
Featuring their arguments with
strong cases on both sides, they re
warded a small audience in the Little
Theatre, with both an intelligent and
an entertaining evening.
The first speaker of the affirma
tive, Lucille Smith, argued the points
that sororities were unnatural
groupings. Celeste Strack opened
the debate for the negative by stat
ing that the evils of the sorority sys
tem were offset by the opportuni
ties which houses offered their mem
bers.
The final speech of the debate, de
livered by Phyllis Norton of U.S.C.,
presented a plan for the organiza
tion of non-members of sororities.
Mary K, Morris chose the topic.
The decision was a draw, credited
to the heated rebuttals on both sides,
and the forceful speeches.
A humorous turn wa,s given to
the forensic contest when it was dis
covered that the speakers arguing
for the abolishment of sororities
were Stanford sorority women while
the U.S.C, women who favored the
continuance of sororities were non
sorority members.
