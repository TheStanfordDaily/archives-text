# DEFENDERS ATTACKED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that those who
conducted the series of articles in
the last week's Daily defending
President Hoover from the scurri
lous attacks of John Hamill weren't
much fairer in their methods than
was the author of "The Strange Ca
reer of Mr. Hoover Under Two
Flags." Why, for example, did they
single out just one book which was
perhaps the weakest of all the at
tacks against Hoover? He needed
no defense from such a book among
intelligent readers. It spoke for it
self and was for the most part ri
diculous to a lair-minded person.
There arc several other books
dealing with Hoover which have
been published recently such
as "The Rise of President Hoover"
by Walter W. Liggett, "Tough Luck
—Hoover Again!" by John L. Heaton,
"Herbert Clark Hoover: An Ameri
can Tragedy" by Clement Wood, and
"The Strange Attack on President
Hoover' by Arthur Train. The lat
ter is the only defense of Hoover of
which I know.
Our campus defenders of Hoover
should have chosen at least a few
of these books and any others that
may have been published on Hoover,
and they should have used them as
subjects for their interviews also.
I think that there is no doubt that
all these books are better written
and better documented than the one
by John Hamill. Perhaps their chal
lenge is not so easily met. At any
rate, had they been chosen, Hoover
would have been treated more fairly
and Stanford students would have
received a more scientific and intel

j ligent view of him.
Sincerely yours,
—Clive M. Warner.
