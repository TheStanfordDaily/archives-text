## 
### 
"Student government at Stanford
would seem to be farther advanced
than at other colleges, and, al
though we feel we gained a great
deal from the conference, we also
feel that Stanford had much to con
tribute." Such was the opinion of
Mar y - Katherine Morris, new
women's president, concerning the j
meeting of A.W.S. heads from West
ern colleges which she and Barbara I
Beach Thompson, retiring president,'
recently attended.
The two Stanford delegates flew
up to Oregon last week, where the
conference was held for one day at j
Eugene and two days at Corvallis.
Sixty-eight delegates from thirty
five colleges, two-thirds of them
from California, attended. Kansas,
Nebraska, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, '
Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Utah,
and Colorado were the other states
represented. i
That the honor system at Stan
ford is at least on a level with that
at other universities was the con
clusion drawn from the discussion
of campus problems. About half of
the colleges represented had in
stalled the honor system. Also the

social regulations here, jncluding
lockouts, are much less strict than {
at other colleges. Other problems j
discussed included vocational guid- I
ance, sororities, co-operative buying |
and housing, and co-operation be ]
tween faculty and students. - I
