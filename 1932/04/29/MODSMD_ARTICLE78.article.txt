# Concert Series Boasts Long, Brilliant History
## 
### 
Highly paid and internationally
famous musical artists have been
brought to the campus during the
past six years through the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series. The first season,
1926-27, was a marked success, al
though it resulted in a small deficit.
The 1927-8 series was under the
management of Gertrude Baker, and
was operated at a loss of over a
thousand dollars. The loss was con
sidered inevitable, because of the
high price of the artists, and the
small amount asked for tickets.
The following season, under the
management of Sidney Madden, all
expenses were paid and most of the
deficit was made up. The artists
featured were Lawrence Tibbett,
John Phillip Sousa, Margarete Mat
zenauer, Albert Spaulding, and t'he
San Francisco Symphony orchestra.

Carl Mather and Carl McDowell
served as concert managers the next
two seasons. In addition to the San
Francisco Symphony orchestra, the
artists heard from 1929 to 1931 in
cluded Efrem Zimbalist, Lawrence
Tibbett, Sigrid Onegrin, the Kedroff
Quartet, Elisabeth Rcthbery, Harold
Bauer, Paul Robson and the Marine
Band.

At the close of Carl McDowell's
year as manager, the loss of 1927-8
had been completely made up, and
there was a small surplus left in the
treasury. This season, 1931-2, the
books of the Concert Series again
show large deficit. But those who
attended the concerts will agree that
a remarkable group of musicians was
presented. Helen Ullman was con
cert manager.
1! the student body voles next
Tuesday to retain the concert series,
it is proposed to organize a small,
permanent advisory committee, com
posed of influential and interested
people in the vicinity of Stanford.
The committee will form a meÂ£fhs
ol continuity from one season to
the next, and will advise each man
ager, and suggest improvements.
There will also be a Palo Alto co
operative committee to handle ticket
sales off the campus.
