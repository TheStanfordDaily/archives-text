# GALLERY EXHIBITS COWBOY SKETCHES, LANDSCAPE PHOTOS
## Artist Displays Unusual Technique In Handling Varied Subjects 
### Harry McMasters 
By Harry McMasters

Thirty pencil drawings of great j
artistry by Allan G. Cram and a [
collection of photographs by the Palo 1
Alto Art Club form the current ex- s
hibition in the Art Gallery.
Cowboys are Cram's favorite sub- (
ject, and his portrayal of them in ac- |
tion, riding in groups, branding j
calves, breaking broncos, is excel- j
lent. One lone cowboy in particular ,
resembles a Galahad of the West,
sitting straight and supple in his !
saddle, eyes fixed ahead.
Seascapes and landscapes also at- j
tract Cram, and he has several fine '
drawings of pueblos. He shows un- I
usual variety of technique in hand- J
ling subjects of different types, now i
using broad, black strokes and now j
delicate, intricate designs. The con- I
trast is seen in the black waves j
breaking over a derelict at sea and'
in other pictures of pueblo doorways !
in the sunlight.
Some very fine landscapes, travel j
photographs, portraits, and detail j
studies are included in the exhibi- j
tion of photographs. The landscapes |
of Burt L. Davis, clear, well-bal- j
anced, are especially attractive.
The Art Gallery is open every day I
from 10 to 5 o'clock.
