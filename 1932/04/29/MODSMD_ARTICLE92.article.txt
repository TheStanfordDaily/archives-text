Only 15 per cent of the Stanford i
roughs wear dirty cords.
Contrary to the popular belief |
that all college men are addicted to I
the use of cords that stand alone,
dirty jackets, and fraternity em- 1
blems printed on the knees of their .
pants—a survey taken in front of j
the Library steps of a representa- j
tive 300 so-called roughs showed i
that only 45 wore their cords col
legiately "dirty."
As high as 30 per cent or 00 out
of the 300, shunned the very aspect !
of a pair of cords, preferring fresh
creased, spotless flannels, tweeds, or
business suits.
Twenty-one per cent, or 63 sturdy
sons, while not bold enough to wear
the stand-alone type, wore cords j
with just a mediu maraount of dirt. !
Their pants had the general aspect
of cleanliness, however, much the
same as a good suit that is some- 1
what run down and is daily expect- j
ing a trip to the cleaners. I

i Another 21 per cent wore theirs
j with ju.st a medium amount of dirt.
I just small smudge patches around
i the outside of the pockets where
j hands are unconsciously yet most
! efficiently cleaned.

had their cords fresh cleaned and
j spotless. The creases still remained
I and the spots of telltale hand-wip
ing or pen-cleaning were conspicu
ous by their absence.
Of the 300, 90 shunned the very
! thought of cords, 39 wore theirs
i spotlessly clean, and 63 more had
[only allowed the dirt supply to
I reach the hand-wiping stage.
