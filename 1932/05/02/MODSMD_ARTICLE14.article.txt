# PEARMAN OPERA DANCE DIRECTOR
## Jean Jamison Takes Role Of Joan Richmond 
### 
Fred Pearman, well-known cam- j
pus tap dancer and fencer, has been 1
cast as the dancing director in the
musical revue of the 1933 Junior j
Opera. Pearman may be selected to j
represent Stanford in fencing at the !
Olympic Games this year and in [
addition to his prowess with the j
foils, he has attained fame through i
his dancing at campus affairs as j
well as at San Francisco hotels.
The role of Joan Richmond will
be taken by Jean Jamison, who has I
played in many campus productions i
held during the past few years. Miss \
Jamison will be remembered for
her work in the 1930 and the 1931 I
Junior Operas and the 1931 Big j
Game Gaieties.
Barbara Collins, the main charac- j
ter of "The: Mistress of Briony,*' j
will play "Goldy," one of the chief
roles of the opera. "Swifty," a comic |
feminine lead, will be taken by Kay j
Wheeler, a newcomer to campus j
dramatics, and enthusiastically de- !
scribed by Harold Helvenston, di
rector, as a "find."
Other talented stars selected to
play in the opera are Gordon Heche, j
popular orchestra leader, Eph (
Engleman, who was leader of a j
theatre orchestra and master of j
ceremonies in SanÂ« Jose, and Wil- j
liam Mahu, playing "Hal Kirby," j
the director of the musical revue. |
Ben Kagan, author of the produc
tion, called "Two's Company," has j
added a few lines to some of the I
minor parts. The parts for the pony
chorus have not yet been cast, so
will be announced later.
Two o'clock this afternoon is the j
time set for the next rehearsal, in- j
stead of tonight, as previously an- ,
nounced. i
