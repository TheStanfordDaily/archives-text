the viewpoint of the Concert Series,

iinee of the Series. . ilhert /.. Penney I
tuirc the opinion of the Student Or- .
(/animations l : and in Friday's Daily.
I
j There is reason to believe that j J
i next year's Concert Series will not j
be forced to draw on A.S.S.U. funds
for support. First and foremost is j
the fact that with no effort on the ,
part of the management and even :
j before the artists are announced,
j orders have already been received j ,
I amunting to over 20 per cent of , '
: last year's season ticket sale. Next ,
year artists of the highest quality |
I will be available at rates far below I'
j those of the past few years.
A small and efficient advisory j ]
board will form the necessary |
! means of continuity from one man- i ■
J ager to the next, a definite promise j
j of co-operation in selling tickets has
j been given us from those in Palo |
| Alto who are deeply interested in
! the future of the series, and next j
I year's manager will have the benefit
! of not one, but two years of ex- I
j perience. These reasons, combined i
! with the possibility of including j
• Yehudi Menuhin in the series,
: should go far to insure its success, j
j The strongest argument against j
I the continuance of the series seems j
! to be that it is not supported by a j
j majority of the students. It has, j
j however, the support of approxi- j
j mately one-third of the student i
, | body, the whole-hearted support oi I
I the faculty and the University au
| thorities, and the support of the
I Palo Alto community.
Activities supported by a far j
i smaller number of students are I
I backed by A.S.S.U. funds and sure- j
j ly they might support an organiza- !
i tion which benefits not only a good
| portion of the students but also the
community at large, even in the
j event of a future deficit. This is
| the sixth season of the Concert Se
[ lies, and so far it has been able to
j make up any deficit it has incurred. !
This year has been marked '
I throughout the country as one in j,
| which few artist series have been j
! self-supporting. If the series is con- i
I tinued there is possibility of mak- !
I ing up a good part of this season's j
: deficit next year.
| The following is a tentative bud- j
get proposed for 1932-33. Though
| tho- sales should be increased be- ;
j cause of greater co-operation from j
Palo Alto and a definite campaign j
for season ticket sales, this budget I
jis based on the income from the
| ticket sales of the past year with a
very conservative estimate of single j
concert receipts. j
Though the amount of an average |
| single concert has been deducted ;
I from the single receipts of this year
i due to the possibility of having i
j four artists next year instead of
five, still the estimated budget gives j
! a margin of over $GOO.
Tentative Budget 1932-33
I Income:
Season tickets $4,29G
Single ticket sales 3,050 j
Total $7,34(5 j

I he fate of the Concert Series lies j
j in the hands of the students who vole ;
