Earthquakes that pass across the
Stanford campus arc determined by
a beam of yellow light and a piece
of tiny tungsten wire in a cement
vault at the Branner Seismologicnl
Station on the Stanford golf course.
There Ihe ever-watching eyes of
science keep tab on the movements
of the earth's crust as it heaves and
trembles.
The small cement box in which
the delicate instruments are housed
has seldom aroused the curiosity of
visitors and students, but inside the
plain-looking enclosure are whirl
ing wheels and sensitive magnets
whose powers baffle the human
brain.
For the purpose of studying the
quakes, two machines are used. One
records (hose in (he North and
South, while'another is sensitive to
vibrations from (lie East and West.
The devices are cemented to an out-

: cropping of basalt not far from the
famous San Andreas fault which
! marks the famous 1906 tremor.
When (he earth's crust jerks or |
j heaves, a beam of light hops up and j
i down and cuts a jagged line across j
\ a piece of film which rotates on a !
I drum (hat is in motion at all times. J
j When there is no quake the ray of !
j yellow light, like the eye of a me-'
i chanical man, cuts a straight line I
; upon the photographic film. The
characteristics of an earthquake can
be studied by the varying forma- I
' lion of the jagged line.
Dr. Sidney D. Townley of the
j mathematics department is director
jof the quake detector station, and
data obtained at Stanford concern
j ing earthquakes i.-> correlated with |
1 that of observatories at Mount Ham- '
1 ilton, University of California, and !
! the Academy of Sciences at San ,
j Francisco.
