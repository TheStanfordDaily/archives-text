# Blazing Ben Thrills Crowd as Stanford Drops Trojan Meet
## Meredith's Record Again Shattered by Eastman; Jones And Gray Also Star for Indians as Wykoff Leads S.C. to Victory 
### MAURICE RAPF 
|j LYMPIC STADIUM, May I.—Stanford lost its annual track meet to the
U.S.C. Trojans, X1 1 1 to 4!) : !4 in the Olympic Stadium here yesterday!
There were 17.000 people in the howl, however, and very few realized
as they left the stadium that the score was what it was; that Dean Crom
well's greatest track team had achieved a great triumph—very few cared.
JVhat they did know was that they had seen a marvelous meet —one com
plete with superlative performances. Little matter who won.

Perhaps a few ardent student root
ers or those who were able to com
prehend the muttering of a feeble
loudspeaker, placed far across the
field, were aware of the score and
| the actual outcome of the meet, but
i the large percentage of the cash cus
j tomers left smiling because they had
j seen a great track meet, and some
; of the best athletes in the country,
i if not the world.
Eastman Shines
First of all, they had seen Ben
| Eastman—the one and only Ben
Eastman—do the impossible. They
had seen him run a 440 with appar
ent ease in the record-breaking time
of 47.1 seconds, only to come back a
half an hour later to win the 880 in
the unusually good time of 1:53.8,
and then to wind up his iron man
performance by running the anchor
! lap on the winning Stanford relay
! team in 46.7 seconds.
The crowd roared as the time for
j Ben's 440 was announced. He had
j again broken Ted Meredith's world
I record of 47.4, and with such ease
i that everyone felt he could have
j equalled his own 46.4 mark. Woess
i ner of U.S.C. tried desperately to
I give the flying Stanford star some
competition, but it was hopeless. It
was the same story in the 880 and
j relay.
Great Discus Work
But that was not all; Ihey had seen
! a field of competitors in the discus
I throw, everyone of whom had the
j platter well out beyond the 150-foot
j mark. They had gasped as Bob
J Jones, the boy who came to Stanford
as a high jumper, almost threw the
i discus into the broad jump pit with
a heave that measured 161 feet. Nel
lie Gray, with a toss of 152 feet, did
not even place. The field was that
good.
And they had seen the incompara
ble Frank Wykoff fly through both
sprints to easy victories, although he
pulled up lame at the close of the
220.
Gray Wins
There had been the shot put, in
which the first three men all had
tosses of better than 48 feet, with
Nellie Gray's winning toss measur
ing 50 feet 6 inches; and there had
been Jeddy Welsh's 14.7 flight of
! high hurdles, and Norman Paul's
| near-record 23.5 mark in the lows,
i particularly interesting when it is
| realized that Paxil is a sophomore at
I U.S.C.
They had seen a near-tie in the
javelin throw between Ray of Stan
ford and Williamson of U.S.C.—two
i tosses that measured so closely that
| county surveyors with their regular
instruments were called into action
1j to settle the final pay-off. This
I event, first on the program, was not
I settled until the end of the meet,
but the U.S.C. star, with a mark of
| 194 lVs inches was declared the win
ner by five-eighths of an inch.
Amdahl Beaten
I Then there had been the two-mile,
1 in which Callahan of U.S.C., with a
i sprint in the last 20 yards, outlasted
I ; Amdahl of Stanford and led his
northern rival to the tape by a few
feet in 9:41.8, a new Southern Cali
i fornia record.
From a Stanford point of view, the
j meet was a disappointment.
The fact that the Trojans shut
Stanford out completely in five
events didn't help the situation any.
The high jump white-wash was more
or less expected, but the clean
sweeps in both hurdle races, the
furlong, and the broad-jump were
surprising. Stanford's one clean
sweep came in the shot-put.
Gus Meier was figured for several
! points in the hurdle races, but the
strong Trojan combinations managed
to eke through ahead of him. In both
races, his third place was taken from
him just at the tape.
Giberson, was the victim of judge's
decisions in both dashes. He came
within a hair's breadth of second in
the century, while from the stands,
it seemed as if he had an absolute
tie with Delby of U.S.C. for third in
the 220. Delby had pulled up with
! a last second rush, however, and
was going away at the finish.
Things looked pretty rosy for the
Cardinal pole vaulters when Bill
Graber, U.S.C.'s 1.C.4A. champion,
i fell out at 12 feet, but the best that
Bill Miller, Burt deGroot, and Ned
Johns could get was a tic for first
i at 13 feet with Chlentzos of Troy,
i The bar was set three inches higher,
! but none of the quartet who had
; cleared 13 feet could make the grade.
A1 Ray apparently had ihe jave
; lin all sewed up, when Williamson
j got off his winning throw on his last
; try. Up to that time, Ray had been
j the only entry with a mark over 190
! feet.
Jimmie Ferric was neatly boxed on
I the last turn of the mile by Halstead
land Hammatt of ihe Trojans, but the
; Cardinal runner ran around to beat
|out Hammatt, although coming in
| about five yards behind Halstead,
Ihe winner.
I When Eastman started on the final
lap of the relay, he didn't take the
baton fifteen yards behind Woessner
! as predicted but actually two yards
ahead of Ihe U.S.C. man. Nash ran
I the first lap, Fu lien wider the second,
j and Captain Ike Hables, on the third
quarter, showed his best form this
I year by gaining three yards on Ab
; lowich of U.S.C. who placed third in
1 the quarter-mile.

|j LYMPIC STADIUM, May I.—Stanford lost its annual track meet to the
U.S.C. Trojans, X1 1 1 to 4!) : !4 in the Olympic Stadium here yesterday!
There were 17.000 people in the howl, however, and very few realized
as they left the stadium that the score was what it was; that Dean Crom
well's greatest track team had achieved a great triumph—very few cared.
JVhat they did know was that they had seen a marvelous meet —one com
plete with superlative performances. Little matter who won.

Perhaps a few ardent student root
ers or those who were able to com
prehend the muttering of a feeble
loudspeaker, placed far across the
field, were aware of the score and
| the actual outcome of the meet, but
i the large percentage of the cash cus
j tomers left smiling because they had
j seen a great track meet, and some
; of the best athletes in the country,
i if not the world.
Eastman Shines
First of all, they had seen Ben
| Eastman—the one and only Ben
Eastman—do the impossible. They
had seen him run a 440 with appar
ent ease in the record-breaking time
of 47.1 seconds, only to come back a
half an hour later to win the 880 in
the unusually good time of 1:53.8,
and then to wind up his iron man
performance by running the anchor
! lap on the winning Stanford relay
! team in 46.7 seconds.
The crowd roared as the time for
j Ben's 440 was announced. He had
j again broken Ted Meredith's world
I record of 47.4, and with such ease
i that everyone felt he could have
j equalled his own 46.4 mark. Woess
i ner of U.S.C. tried desperately to
I give the flying Stanford star some
competition, but it was hopeless. It
was the same story in the 880 and
j relay.
Great Discus Work
But that was not all; Ihey had seen
! a field of competitors in the discus
I throw, everyone of whom had the
j platter well out beyond the 150-foot
j mark. They had gasped as Bob
J Jones, the boy who came to Stanford
as a high jumper, almost threw the
i discus into the broad jump pit with
a heave that measured 161 feet. Nel
lie Gray, with a toss of 152 feet, did
not even place. The field was that
good.
And they had seen the incompara
ble Frank Wykoff fly through both
sprints to easy victories, although he
pulled up lame at the close of the
220.
Gray Wins
There had been the shot put, in
which the first three men all had
tosses of better than 48 feet, with
Nellie Gray's winning toss measur
ing 50 feet 6 inches; and there had
been Jeddy Welsh's 14.7 flight of
! high hurdles, and Norman Paul's
| near-record 23.5 mark in the lows,
i particularly interesting when it is
| realized that Paxil is a sophomore at
I U.S.C.
They had seen a near-tie in the
javelin throw between Ray of Stan
ford and Williamson of U.S.C.—two
i tosses that measured so closely that
| county surveyors with their regular
instruments were called into action
1j to settle the final pay-off. This
I event, first on the program, was not
I settled until the end of the meet,
but the U.S.C. star, with a mark of
| 194 lVs inches was declared the win
ner by five-eighths of an inch.
Amdahl Beaten
I Then there had been the two-mile,
1 in which Callahan of U.S.C., with a
i sprint in the last 20 yards, outlasted
I ; Amdahl of Stanford and led his
northern rival to the tape by a few
feet in 9:41.8, a new Southern Cali
i fornia record.
From a Stanford point of view, the
j meet was a disappointment.
The fact that the Trojans shut
Stanford out completely in five
events didn't help the situation any.
The high jump white-wash was more
or less expected, but the clean
sweeps in both hurdle races, the
furlong, and the broad-jump were
surprising. Stanford's one clean
sweep came in the shot-put.
Gus Meier was figured for several
! points in the hurdle races, but the
strong Trojan combinations managed
to eke through ahead of him. In both
races, his third place was taken from
him just at the tape.
Giberson, was the victim of judge's
decisions in both dashes. He came
within a hair's breadth of second in
the century, while from the stands,
it seemed as if he had an absolute
tie with Delby of U.S.C. for third in
the 220. Delby had pulled up with
! a last second rush, however, and
was going away at the finish.
Things looked pretty rosy for the
Cardinal pole vaulters when Bill
Graber, U.S.C.'s 1.C.4A. champion,
i fell out at 12 feet, but the best that
Bill Miller, Burt deGroot, and Ned
Johns could get was a tic for first
i at 13 feet with Chlentzos of Troy,

There were 17.000 people in the howl, however, and very few realized
as they left the stadium that the score was what it was; that Dean Crom
well's greatest track team had achieved a great triumph—very few cared.

j tomers left smiling because they had
j seen a great track meet, and some
; of the best athletes in the country,
i if not the world.
Eastman Shines
First of all, they had seen Ben
| Eastman—the one and only Ben
Eastman—do the impossible. They
had seen him run a 440 with appar
ent ease in the record-breaking time
of 47.1 seconds, only to come back a
half an hour later to win the 880 in
the unusually good time of 1:53.8,
and then to wind up his iron man
performance by running the anchor
! lap on the winning Stanford relay
! team in 46.7 seconds.
The crowd roared as the time for
j Ben's 440 was announced. He had
j again broken Ted Meredith's world
I record of 47.4, and with such ease
i that everyone felt he could have
j equalled his own 46.4 mark. Woess
i ner of U.S.C. tried desperately to
I give the flying Stanford star some
competition, but it was hopeless. It
was the same story in the 880 and
j relay.
Great Discus Work
But that was not all; Ihey had seen
! a field of competitors in the discus
I throw, everyone of whom had the
j platter well out beyond the 150-foot
j mark. They had gasped as Bob
J Jones, the boy who came to Stanford
as a high jumper, almost threw the
i discus into the broad jump pit with
a heave that measured 161 feet. Nel
lie Gray, with a toss of 152 feet, did
not even place. The field was that
good.
And they had seen the incompara
ble Frank Wykoff fly through both
sprints to easy victories, although he
pulled up lame at the close of the
220.
Gray Wins
There had been the shot put, in
which the first three men all had
tosses of better than 48 feet, with
Nellie Gray's winning toss measur
ing 50 feet 6 inches; and there had
been Jeddy Welsh's 14.7 flight of
! high hurdles, and Norman Paul's
| near-record 23.5 mark in the lows,
i particularly interesting when it is
| realized that Paxil is a sophomore at
I U.S.C.
They had seen a near-tie in the
javelin throw between Ray of Stan

i tosses that measured so closely that

instruments were called into action
1j to settle the final pay-off. This
