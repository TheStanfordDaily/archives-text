# S.O.S. SOUNDS AS STANFORD ROUGH CITADEL YIELDS
## 
### 
Sequoia, the last stronghold
of the rough, is losing its repu
tation! Flowers in the button
holes, lace handkerchiefs peek
ing from pockets, and powder
puffs on dressers â€”spell the
downfall of the old order of
roughs.
Perhaps the worst evidence
of the fall of the old fort is the
rumor that a perfume agency
has been started in the hall.
It is to be hoped that this is
for the benefit of the "500," but
all evidence is to the contrary.
The few men of brawn still
left in Sequoia must rally to
the colors if the last stand is to
be rescued from the inroads of
frivolity.
Stanford will no longer be
the same when the Sequoia
rough has disappeared. Heaven
preserve him!
