sia, and against unemployment.

Stalin Reviews Army
Thus the Union of Socialist Soviet
Republics led the world in the cele
bration of the traditional day of the
worker. The whole of the vast fed
eration of republics was bedecked
in flaming red banners, posters, and
flags, and oratory proclaimed the
power of the proletariat.
In Red Square Joseph Stalin,
secretary-general of the Communist
Party and virtual ruler of Russia,
joined other high government and
party officials in reviewing the day
long parade of Red Army troops,
workers, and peasants.

The parade lasted three hours
and after it came thousands of
workers who had waited in forma
tion all morning. They converged
into the square from Ihree en
trances and trudged slowly past the
reviewing stand in ranks which
stretched ail the way across the
huge open area. They made up in
shouts, cheers, and songs what they
lacked in military precision.
This was the same demonstration
of former May Days except that the
Soviet's progress with machinery
was more in evidence than ever
before. Nearly 300 of the nation's
largest battle planes soared over the
paraders. Added color was lent by
the presence of lsmct Pasha, pre
mier of Turkey, who watched the
demonstration from the review
stand.
