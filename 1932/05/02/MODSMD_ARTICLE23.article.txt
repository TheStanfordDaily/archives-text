Sacrifices Asked
Stanford is no exception among
; the communities which are facing
I the effects of financial panic, he
i pointed out. Students are facing
J hardships of a college training. Yet
j the members of this community
I realize that now, more than ever,
1 responsibilities involving the health
I and even the life of others must be
I maintained.
The Appeal this year is directed
| toward the purpose of securing
| funds from those that can afford to
give. Students absolutely unable to
I contribute will not be driven in any
j way. The great majority, however,
j who can give by the sacrificc of
I some small luxury, are requested,
! this year as never before, to re
| spond to this crisis in the students'
j own charity—the Stanford Conva
] lescent Home .
