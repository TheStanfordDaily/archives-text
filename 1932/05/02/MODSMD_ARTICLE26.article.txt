# AND WHY NOT?

### 
Stanford women are normal, healthy, and ever since
Iheir first memorable advent in this I niversitv have en
joyed quite a reputation for being more intelligent than
Ihe average female.
In fact, Stanford women have even been given credit
011 occasion for being more than usually attractive. And,
;is far as the rough is able to discern, the freshman element
of the "f>00" is no contradiction to this statement.
It seems that Stanford women, during their iirst three
quarters of scholastic work, are permitted to participate in
countless activities: they may debate, enter into athletic
competition, join in musical activities, write for the Daily,
(Ihappic, or Qiuul, try out for the business staffs of those
organizations, hold and attend countless teas in tact, al
most anything that is not particularly conducive to study.
However . . . and here is where the catch appears . . .
I'or several supposedly excellent reasons, freshmen women
are NOT allowed to participate in campus dramatic pro
ductions.
It is claimed by the "powers that be" that this plan
"would enable freshmen women to become adjusted to
Iheir surroundings" before going into this activity. It is
also claimed that it would be a good idea if freshman men
might be forbidden participation in such activity.
A peculiar feature of the entire scheme arises in the
failure of those in charge lo take the famous Roble bull
sessions of nightly duration into consideration. It is com
mon knowledge that no matter at what hour the fair mem
bers of the "500" wander into the Hasti llc in the evening, it
is practically certain that they will not "hit the hay" until
the wee hours of the morning.
Freshman women, then, are permitted to do plenty of
things a great deal more strenuous than taking part in dra
matics. They tire given ample opportunity to waste time
on countless other occupations. There are several who
would like the opportunity lo break into Stanford's fre
quent stage offerings and receive the preliminary training
for which they must now wait until their sophomore year.
Stanford sophomore women are allowed to take part in
all campus productions; in most cases they are not notice
ably older, nor more intelligent, nor more experienced than
the average freshman girl. A freshman woman could
scarcely be harmed by being permitted to engage in the ac
tivity that she has set her heart on, providing, of course,
that she did not overburden herself with other duties. She
should be able lo lake care of herself; she is a university
student and no longer in a kindergarten class, it is to be
hoped. If site has brains enough lo get into this I'niversity,
whv is it that she cannot look out for her scholastic record
lo the extent of engaging in such an activity as dramatics
and still attend lo her academic work? Several persons
rightfully wonder why . . . and why not?

hoped. If site has brains enough lo get into this I'niversity,
whv is it that she cannot look out for her scholastic record
lo the extent of engaging in such an activity as dramatics
and still attend lo her academic work? Several persons
rightfully wonder why . . . and why not?
Stanford women are normal, healthy, and ever since
Iheir first memorable advent in this I niversitv have en
joyed quite a reputation for being more intelligent than
Ihe average female.
In fact, Stanford women have even been given credit
011 occasion for being more than usually attractive. And,
;is far as the rough is able to discern, the freshman element
of the "f>00" is no contradiction to this statement.
It seems that Stanford women, during their iirst three
quarters of scholastic work, are permitted to participate in
countless activities: they may debate, enter into athletic
competition, join in musical activities, write for the Daily,
(Ihappic, or Qiuul, try out for the business staffs of those
organizations, hold and attend countless teas in tact, al
most anything that is not particularly conducive to study.
However . . . and here is where the catch appears . . .
I'or several supposedly excellent reasons, freshmen women
are NOT allowed to participate in campus dramatic pro
ductions.
It is claimed by the "powers that be" that this plan
"would enable freshmen women to become adjusted to
Iheir surroundings" before going into this activity. It is
also claimed that it would be a good idea if freshman men
might be forbidden participation in such activity.
A peculiar feature of the entire scheme arises in the
failure of those in charge lo take the famous Roble bull
sessions of nightly duration into consideration. It is com
mon knowledge that no matter at what hour the fair mem
bers of the "500" wander into the Hasti llc in the evening, it
is practically certain that they will not "hit the hay" until
the wee hours of the morning.
Freshman women, then, are permitted to do plenty of
things a great deal more strenuous than taking part in dra
matics. They tire given ample opportunity to waste time
on countless other occupations. There are several who
would like the opportunity lo break into Stanford's fre
quent stage offerings and receive the preliminary training
for which they must now wait until their sophomore year.
Stanford sophomore women are allowed to take part in
all campus productions; in most cases they are not notice
ably older, nor more intelligent, nor more experienced than
the average freshman girl. A freshman woman could
scarcely be harmed by being permitted to engage in the ac
tivity that she has set her heart on, providing, of course,
that she did not overburden herself with other duties. She
should be able lo lake care of herself; she is a university
student and no longer in a kindergarten class, it is to be
hoped. If site has brains enough lo get into this I'niversity,
whv is it that she cannot look out for her scholastic record
