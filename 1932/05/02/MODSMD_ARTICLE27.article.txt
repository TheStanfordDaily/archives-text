# IS STANFORD TONGUE-TIED?

Id seven out of lei) cases this question would he inap
propriate n ink-nded to concern the Stanford rough and
his local maiden. Rut, especially in past weeks, it is most
appropriately applicable to the remaining three.
it lias been habitual, from historic tradition, for the
Stanford rough (and the Indian maiden) to greet every
one he meets in walking about the campus with a cheery
"Hello!" and a smile in greeting as they pass. In recent
days, the stony glances received quite frequently as one
"helloes" about the Quad is quite comical . . . especially to
the brave rough who ventures his "hello" to a fair maid of
unknown quantity.
Of course, it may be quite all right for this to continue,
but again . . . wouldn't it be nice for rnni/oiir, regardless
of age, size, or sex, to start out today with a happy greet
ing to every person he or she meets?
