# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Friday afternoon :i racially mixed
i jury in Honolulu declared Lieuten
| ant Thomas H. Massie. Mrs. Gran
| ville Fortescue, and two American
| sailors guilty of manslaughter, and
i responsible for the death of Joseph
i Kahahawai, one of live accused of
attacking Mrs. Thalia Massie. The
most significant aspect of the trial
j was the storm of protest which
| arose when the decision was an
' nounced.
"One hundred per cent Ameri
, cans" throughout the world saw
red. A body of twelve men, com-
I posed of whites and partly of jurors
!of foreign blood, in a territorial
i court had the affront to decide
AGAINST an officer of the United
] States Navy. The adrenal glands of
1 thousands of Army and Navy of
j fieials were aroused and Sunday
1 morning papers carried their state
| ments denouncing this slap in the
' Navy's face. Motions to hold a new
trial on the mainland, with a jury
: composed of twelve white men,
: were immediately instituted. "Right
or wrong" the Navy would stick by
: Lieutenant Massie.
Now if the expected acquittal had'
! resulted from the case, the Honolulu
| jury would have been commended
| as a broad-minded body that had
i justly put aside technical details
pertaining to punishment for the
act of killing a man. They would
has been praised as far-seeing
observers of the "Unwritten law."

JUSTICE?

! Whether this so-called "unwrit
| ten law," so prevalent in French
\ courts of the nineteenth century, is
! just or unjust, is, comparatively
speaking, a less important factor.
j The significant idea is that the de
i cisions of juries should be recog
i nized, or the whole existing legal
j system destroyed. And il a court
'composed of representatives of other
' th an the white race decides against
white defendants, their decision
' must be regarded as just, or the
whole spirit 01 internationalism
| which is now beginning to peek its
| head out of the closet into a world
Jof narrow patriotism must be cast
I aside as an Utopian goal impossible
j to attain.
j An Associated Press dispatch
i from Honolulu says that a group of
, women, principally Navy, have
formed a boycott against places em
ploying members of the jury which
convicted the four defendants in
the Joseph Kahahawai lynching
, trial. As long as this spirit pre
; i vails, we are almost inclined to
agree with Prosecutor John C. Kel
ley's words: "To Hell with the Ad
!* mirals!"
Unless this narrow-minded out
look on law as an international or
: gan of justice is eliminated, the
; j Army and Navy will join the Al
â–  Capones, prohibition, and the sup
. pressing of negro suffrage as "sacred
i ; cows" of American courts.
