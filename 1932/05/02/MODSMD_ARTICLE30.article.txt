# THE 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
Windjammer took in the Engineers'
i Dance with her bridge-builder, but
| she was pretty disappointed. From
advance reports she expected to
have 16 hurdle turbines and pivot
between cogwheels, and the only
things smacking of machines were
I some little gadgets tucked away in
the corners where no one could see
them. Also she read somewhere
that the dance was going to trans
form the gym into a regular fairy
land; it may have been some pub
licity agent's idea of fairyland, but
| it wasn't Windjammer's.
| Two other little items came to
| Windj's attention over the week
end. One —sleeping in the library,
| two —the fleet's invasion of the cam
j pus. The first is very bad. She un
j derstands that when the brothers
and sisters keep the radio going
1 from eigljt a.m. on, you can't get
' your sleep. The library being the
j only really quiet place on the
i Farm, it's logically the best place
| for sleeping.
If not the best, it runs a close
j second to lectures; there's nothing
) like a good lecture to close the eyes,
i Howere, having wandered a little,
i the point is, as Windjammer wants
to make clear to you, that it looks
mighty bad to the tourists. They
think that Stanford students ate
Students. But when one steps into
the reading room and sees four out
! of six heads either flat on the tables
I or wobbling in mid-air—one must
i wonder what the score is.
Stanford can't have them getting

i bad impressions of her students. So
I it looks like Windjammer, who has
| the interests of the University al
ways at heart, will have to figure
j out a remedy. That is, unless the
S Women's Council can't.
] The second matter that ruffled
1 Windjammer's calm is this whole
! sale campus invasion of the United
' States Navy—a bus load of gobs, to
! be exact. Two of her pals were sur
\ prised and shocked to look up from
! picking posies on the way home
from the P.O. to find GO sailors
j hanging out of the bus windows,
I ogling them. As if that wasn't
j enough, when the two young ladies
j walked in the door of their Living
Group, there was a marine on the
j best sofa!
A last remark . . . Windjammer
j warns the campus roughs to brush
] upon their he-man technic, because
| it's going to be in great demand if
| the Saturday afternoon migration of
i the "500'' to see Johnny Weismuller
i leap from tree to tree is any indi-
I cation of feminine taste. —H.C.
