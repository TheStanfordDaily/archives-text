# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
j The Editor, Sir:
An uninformed person reading in
| your issue of today the article on
[ the first page entitled "Concert
; Series History Retold" and the edi
torial entitled "Vote Intelligently,"
! might arrive at the erroneous in
! ference that no concerts were given
; on the campus before the A.S.S.U.
I Concert Series was organized in
1926.
It is fair to have more history re
told. There was an established con
| cert series on the campus when
i Wilfred Davis organized the stu
| dent series. The students were ad
; vised by different members of the
i faculty that the campus could not
! support two series of concerts and
! that the success of the student
series would mean the suspension
i of the older series.
j It was also predicted that the
I time would come when the student
j body would tire of the burden and
of deficits, when such came to be
J incurred. The end result, if the
present series is disbanded, has
j been the driving out of an estab
lished series by a new series which
i has not proved self-sustaining.
Very truly yours,
A. E. Taylor
