# VOCATIONAL BUREAU OFFERS ADAPTATION TESTS TO STUDENTS
## 
### 
Students without plans for a vo
cation may avail themselves of ex
pert advice from C. Gilbert Wrenn,
secretary of the Stanford Vocation
al Guidance Bureau.
A test, based on the characteris
tic traits of successful men in 25
different types of work, is given at
the nominal cost of two dollars for
correcting. From it one may judge
in which of these professions he is
most likely to succeed.
The test was devised by Dr. Ed
ward Kellogg Strong of the Stan
ford School of Business and is based
on the theory that, successful men
in certain professions represent
those who were most adapted to
their fields naturally. By studying
the likes, dislikes, and personal
characteristics of a large number of
such men it was possible to devise
a test to measure the adaptability
of persons seeking vocational ad
vice.
Appointments may be made and
tests may be procured at the In
formation desk in the Administra
tion Building.
