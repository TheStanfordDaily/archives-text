I THE DEVIL'S LOTTERY—At the f
j Stanford Theatre.
Elissa Landi's acting is a bit I
! superficial and somewhat strained, |
j but she is good to look at, and the !
j show is worth seeing for the "sup- {
porting cast"—which displays some |
| fine acting.
j Victor McLaglen carries off hon
j ors as usual as a racing fan in loud :
, checks, a Cockney comic is vividly j
1 done by one Herbert Mundin, and i
j Ralph Morgan shows appreciation j
; in his ungrateful part as the para- j
' lytic who wins the heroine in the
j end. "Lord Litchfield" is admirably :
j acted and Beryl Mercer does the j
! competent little cockney woman i
| again as well as ever.
If we did justice to them all, ihe ;
j list would be very long. We must 1
not forget the handsome villain,!
! Paul Cavanaugh, who by good act
ing succeeds in being cordially dis- j
, liked.
The plot is good, not too trite, and |
1 well knit.
Shorts—recommended to majors !

i THE BROKEN WING—AI the Var- i
sity Theatre.
| Someone suddenly realized that j
j the call of the whippoorwill sounded j
i like the first bar of "Over There" i
! and wrote a scenario using the fact |
■in the climax. The result is fair, j
■ with the ex-War flyer landing in'
l the lovely Senorita's front yard and J
; falling in love with her at the same 1
j time he loses his memory. The only j
drawback is that the Senorita al- !
; ready has a caballero in the form i
lof the'Robin-Hoodish hero-villain I
j of the story.
i Lupe Velez, Leo Carrillo, and j
j Melvyn Douglas arc their usual
: selves and help the general atmos- I
' phere greatly. There are some good
j laughs and the whole show is quite
i harmless.
The Hearst News Reel is medium;
| the other shorts are not so good
I unless you are very fond of slap
■ stick.
THREE SCORE AND TEN — By
Alec Waugh. Douhleday, Doran,
1931. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop.)
A story of three men: the grand
[ father, (he son, and the grandson.
; Alec Waugh has striven to show, in
| ihe light of changing conditions, the
changes in attitude of the son to
j ward the father, and has presented
sympathetically the struggle of a
I father for his son's affection and
understanding. Hilary Cardew, the
! son, is the character with which the !
j book deals chiefly, giving a mirror
! of his entire life. His son, Godfrey,
i of the War generation, is not pre
| sen ted in so striking a manner as j
| the older man, and not so clearly.

Perhaps the best part of the story
deals with Hilary's schooldays in
one of the English public schools.
Hilary is :t very normal person,
filled with ambitions as a boy; but
when he marries and settles down
to bringing up a family, he forgets
his ideals and is willing to let things
take their natural course with no
help from him.
The latter part of the book deals
with Godfrey':; reaction to the world
after participating in the War, but
is in no way comparable to the
early parts oi the story. Alec Waugh
seems a sentimentalist, and appears
to look upon marriage as the end
of all difficulties. He attempts no
analysis of married life. Perhaps if
he had left Hilary a bachelor the
story would have been much great
er than it is. —C.H.
