# Paly Censors Perplexed As Rough Hisses Movies
## 
### JULIUS JACOBS 
Jt seems that a great experiment
is in tiie making by the city fathers
>!' Palo Alto. However, it appears
is if all their efforts to better the
uoral standards of the Stanford
Rough are destined to failure.
To improve the taste of the aver
igt' college student attending the
heatres in Paly, the city council
nembers met in caucus and cut
;ccnes so obnoxious to the public
aste as to cause delicately timed
mtbursts when a passionate Jove
:cene flashes across the screen.
The poor censors got tangled up
n their moral problems. Some of
heir woes came to light in an edi
orial in the Palo Alto Times, tell -
ng of a recent meeting, during
which the town fathers discussed
he desirability and value of film
:eiisorship. One council member
leclared thai he couldn't see how
he local film review board was do

| ing any good since "rotten pictures
are still shown." Then another one [
of the censors came out with the j
I original statement that it all de- ;
j pends on what you call rotten.
So it appears that the town board
in control of the morals of the pa- '
Irons of the sound houses is in j
quite a dilemna either way. If they
cut over-affectionate scenes, they
will soothe the savage wrath of
the Rough. If they censor too much i
they will deprive him of the en- i
, tertainment he craves. If they do j
neither, the virtuous town people j
I will rise in indignation, and if they j
keep debating the question indefi- '
nitely at their Monday night meet- j
ings, the question will probably ,
evoke another "Boston Tea Party,"
with the censor board providing the !
1 tea in the form of film, and the j
Rough providing the party, which
would probably deposit the so- [
I called tea at the bottom of Lagunita.
