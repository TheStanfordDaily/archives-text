# NEW TAX LOOMS BEFORE SENATE
## House Defeat Of Thrift Bill Raises Revenue Query 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 1.(/I 3 ) —
With the $200,000,000 economy leg
islation all but wrecked in the tur
bulent House, Senate chieftains to
day turned disappointedly toward
the possibility of being forced to
find more revenue through addi
tions to the billion-dollar tax bill.
Unitedly, however, leaders from
both ends of the Capitol promised
prompt disposition of the vital but
unpopular budget balancing legis
lation. The revenue raising bill will
reach the Senate this week from the
rapid working Finance Committee,
but some delay may entail as a re
sult of the probable necessity for
seeking out revenue to replace that
thrown out of the economy bill.
Still fighting for the remaining
provisions of the ruined retrench
ment measure, House leaders will
resume debate on it Tuesday. They
will try also to retrieve some of the
$117,000,000 in economies stricken
out by calling later for roll call
votes on the eliminated provisions.
Where to turn for more revenue
is perplexing the committee which
already has decided to tap pari
mutual race tickets as one new
source. An import tax on rubber
estimated to yield $50,000,000 annu
ally also is considered.
Reduction in expenditures by
$300,000,000 was conceded to be
necessary to make the billion-dollar
revenue measure passed by the
House balance the 1933 budget.
