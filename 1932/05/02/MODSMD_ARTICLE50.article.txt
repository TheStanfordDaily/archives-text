When little Gin-Gin and I walked
into the Cocoanut Grove on Satur
day night we almost stumbled on
the table where George "Goldie"
Bear, "Kid" Trojan, and Stanley
Indian were sitting. Boasting a j
speaking acquaintance with each |
one of them, I introduced my little j
Hollywood High terror to the three
famous athletes. "How arc ya,
m'girl," roared "Kid" Trojan con- j
fidently, and "Goldie" Bear patted i
her little blonde locks affection- J
ately, but poor Stanley only grunt
ed. Gin-Gill looked a little peeved
at this, because she just adored
those Palo Alto boys, but pretty
soon she regained her spirits.
We sat out the first dance be
cause Don Novis was singing
"Channaine," although we had a
hard time hearing the silver
throated tenor because "Kid" Tro
jan insisted on bringing up the sub
ject of the Stanford-U.S.C. track
meet. "Now what do you think
about this boy Norman Paul?" he
asked. "He certainly skimmed those
low hurdles like a champion."
"Pretty good!" admitted "Goldie"
Bear reluctantly. "But say, we've
got a timber-topper up at Berkeley
who'll be taking them all by this |
time next year. His name's Mc-
Vay . . . ."
Sunk deep in his chair, and look
ing gloomily into his nearly empty
glass, "Stan" Indian spoke up for
the first time: "How about Meier?
Say that boy's got the stuff. Just
because he didn't place this after
noon .... I'll bet he'll be right up
with them in the Fresno Relays
. ... or the 1.C.4-A. anyway."
Seeing an argument brewing,
Gin-Gin and I stole softly away, and
danced to "Lovable" and "Mona
Lisa."
V?'
When we got back to the table
we saw that our three companions
were feeling much happie*, while a I
couple of plain clothes men looked
at our table suspiciously.
"Gad, what a team! WATTA
TEAM!" vociferated "Kid" Trojan
proudly thumping his much-envied j
chest. "And even if we do lose Wy
kofF, Woessner, McGcah, and Stew
art, we've got a great bunch of
freshmen coming up. Take these
two middle-distance stars Jim Cas
sin and Ferris Webster. They'll be
right up with Eastman next year!"
"Well, talking about next year's
prospects, I'd say we aren't so bad
off,'' confided "Goldie" Bear. "Now
this frosh broad-jumper we've got,
Dick Branting, has gotten out a
good 23 feet, 6 inches, and he'll be
around a foot farther out next
spring."
"Next season. NEXT season.
That's all you guys ever talk about.
Why dontcha ever worry about this
season? WHY DONTCHA?" pleaded
"Stan."
' "Say, who are you to talk about
this season?" roared "Kid" Trojan—
BIV4 to 49"/4'. An' you're yappin'
about this season."
"Well, I'd like to talk about this
season," announced "Goldie" Bear
in a rather aggravated tone. "What
about Bob Kiesel?"
"Yes, what about him?" growled
"Kid" Trojan with half a sandwich
smothering most of the belligerent
tone of his voice.
"He's the best sprinter in the
country. That's what he is! Frankic
Wvkoff's chicken to race him."
"He's not."
"He is."
"He's not."
"He is."
Stanley Indian looked at Gin-Gin
and myself appcalingly, the while
muttering some words like: "Hables
. . . broken ribs . . . sprained ankle
. . . sinus trouble . . . tapeworm . . .
pulled muscle . .
When Gin-Gin and I left the table
for the next dance Stanley had
fallen into a coma repeating over
and over: "Hables . . . broken ribs
. . . sprained ankle . . . sinus trouble
. . . tapeworm . . . pulled muscle."
And so on for hours and hours
until at last the Hollywood Terror
began to get tired of "Kid" Trojan
treading on her toes (for the "Kid"
had started dancing). But when we
finally left, "Kid" Trojan was still
boasting loudly, "Goldie" Bear was
still patting everyone confidently on
the back, while Stanley Indian
seemed to have at last caught the
spirit of the occasion and had begun
to talk a bit less dejectedly about
the Fresno Relays, the 1.C.4-A., and
the Olympic Games.
And so ends the evening, dear
reader, as far as YOU are con
cerned. —A.J.G.

kofF, Woessner, McGcah, and Stew
art, we've got a great bunch of
freshmen coming up. Take these
two middle-distance stars Jim Cas
sin and Ferris Webster. They'll be
right up with Eastman next year!"
"Well, talking about next year's
prospects, I'd say we aren't so bad
off,'' confided "Goldie" Bear. "Now
this frosh broad-jumper we've got,
Dick Branting, has gotten out a
good 23 feet, 6 inches, and he'll be
around a foot farther out next
spring."
"Next season. NEXT season.
That's all you guys ever talk about.
Why dontcha ever worry about this
season? WHY DONTCHA?" pleaded
"Stan."
' "Say, who are you to talk about
this season?" roared "Kid" Trojan—
BIV4 to 49"/4'. An' you're yappin'
about this season."
"Well, I'd like to talk about this
season," announced "Goldie" Bear
in a rather aggravated tone. "What
about Bob Kiesel?"
"Yes, what about him?" growled
"Kid" Trojan with half a sandwich
smothering most of the belligerent
tone of his voice.
"He's the best sprinter in the
country. That's what he is! Frankic
Wvkoff's chicken to race him."
"He's not."
"He is."
"He's not."
"He is."
Stanley Indian looked at Gin-Gin
and myself appcalingly, the while
muttering some words like: "Hables
. . . broken ribs . . . sprained ankle
. . . sinus trouble . . . tapeworm . . .
pulled muscle . .
When Gin-Gin and I left the table
for the next dance Stanley had
fallen into a coma repeating over
and over: "Hables . . . broken ribs
. . . sprained ankle . . . sinus trouble
. . . tapeworm . . . pulled muscle."
And so on for hours and hours
until at last the Hollywood Terror
began to get tired of "Kid" Trojan
treading on her toes (for the "Kid"
had started dancing). But when we
finally left, "Kid" Trojan was still
boasting loudly, "Goldie" Bear was
still patting everyone confidently on
the back, while Stanley Indian
seemed to have at last caught the
spirit of the occasion and had begun
to talk a bit less dejectedly about
the Fresno Relays, the 1.C.4-A., and
the Olympic Games.
And so ends the evening, dear
reader, as far as YOU are con
cerned. —A.J.G.
When little Gin-Gin and I walked
into the Cocoanut Grove on Satur
day night we almost stumbled on
the table where George "Goldie"
Bear, "Kid" Trojan, and Stanley
Indian were sitting. Boasting a j
speaking acquaintance with each |
one of them, I introduced my little j
Hollywood High terror to the three
famous athletes. "How arc ya,
m'girl," roared "Kid" Trojan con- j
fidently, and "Goldie" Bear patted i
her little blonde locks affection- J
ately, but poor Stanley only grunt
ed. Gin-Gill looked a little peeved
at this, because she just adored
those Palo Alto boys, but pretty
soon she regained her spirits.
We sat out the first dance be
cause Don Novis was singing
"Channaine," although we had a
hard time hearing the silver
throated tenor because "Kid" Tro
jan insisted on bringing up the sub
ject of the Stanford-U.S.C. track
meet. "Now what do you think
about this boy Norman Paul?" he
asked. "He certainly skimmed those
low hurdles like a champion."
"Pretty good!" admitted "Goldie"
Bear reluctantly. "But say, we've
got a timber-topper up at Berkeley
who'll be taking them all by this |
time next year. His name's Mc-
Vay . . . ."
Sunk deep in his chair, and look
ing gloomily into his nearly empty
glass, "Stan" Indian spoke up for
the first time: "How about Meier?
Say that boy's got the stuff. Just
because he didn't place this after
noon .... I'll bet he'll be right up
with them in the Fresno Relays
. ... or the 1.C.4-A. anyway."
Seeing an argument brewing,
Gin-Gin and I stole softly away, and
danced to "Lovable" and "Mona
Lisa."
V?'
When we got back to the table
we saw that our three companions
were feeling much happie*, while a I
couple of plain clothes men looked
at our table suspiciously.
"Gad, what a team! WATTA
TEAM!" vociferated "Kid" Trojan
proudly thumping his much-envied j
chest. "And even if we do lose Wy
kofF, Woessner, McGcah, and Stew

boasting loudly, "Goldie" Bear was
still patting everyone confidently on
the back, while Stanley Indian
seemed to have at last caught the
spirit of the occasion and had begun
to talk a bit less dejectedly about
the Fresno Relays, the 1.C.4-A., and
the Olympic Games.
And so ends the evening, dear

When little Gin-Gin and I walked
into the Cocoanut Grove on Satur
day night we almost stumbled on
the table where George "Goldie"
Bear, "Kid" Trojan, and Stanley
Indian were sitting. Boasting a j
speaking acquaintance with each |
one of them, I introduced my little j
Hollywood High terror to the three
famous athletes. "How arc ya,
m'girl," roared "Kid" Trojan con- j
fidently, and "Goldie" Bear patted i
her little blonde locks affection- J
ately, but poor Stanley only grunt
ed. Gin-Gill looked a little peeved
at this, because she just adored
those Palo Alto boys, but pretty
soon she regained her spirits.
We sat out the first dance be
cause Don Novis was singing
"Channaine," although we had a
hard time hearing the silver
throated tenor because "Kid" Tro
jan insisted on bringing up the sub
ject of the Stanford-U.S.C. track
meet. "Now what do you think
about this boy Norman Paul?" he
asked. "He certainly skimmed those
low hurdles like a champion."
"Pretty good!" admitted "Goldie"
Bear reluctantly. "But say, we've
got a timber-topper up at Berkeley
who'll be taking them all by this |
time next year. His name's Mc-
Vay . . . ."
Sunk deep in his chair, and look
ing gloomily into his nearly empty
glass, "Stan" Indian spoke up for
the first time: "How about Meier?
Say that boy's got the stuff. Just
because he didn't place this after
noon .... I'll bet he'll be right up
with them in the Fresno Relays
. ... or the 1.C.4-A. anyway."
Seeing an argument brewing,
Gin-Gin and I stole softly away, and
danced to "Lovable" and "Mona
Lisa."
V?'
When we got back to the table
we saw that our three companions
were feeling much happie*, while a I
couple of plain clothes men looked
at our table suspiciously.
"Gad, what a team! WATTA
TEAM!" vociferated "Kid" Trojan
proudly thumping his much-envied j
chest. "And even if we do lose Wy
kofF, Woessner, McGcah, and Stew
art, we've got a great bunch of
freshmen coming up. Take these
two middle-distance stars Jim Cas
sin and Ferris Webster. They'll be
right up with Eastman next year!"
"Well, talking about next year's
prospects, I'd say we aren't so bad
off,'' confided "Goldie" Bear. "Now
this frosh broad-jumper we've got,
Dick Branting, has gotten out a
good 23 feet, 6 inches, and he'll be
around a foot farther out next
spring."
"Next season. NEXT season.
That's all you guys ever talk about.
Why dontcha ever worry about this
season? WHY DONTCHA?" pleaded
"Stan."
' "Say, who are you to talk about
this season?" roared "Kid" Trojan—
BIV4 to 49"/4'. An' you're yappin'
about this season."
"Well, I'd like to talk about this
season," announced "Goldie" Bear
in a rather aggravated tone. "What
about Bob Kiesel?"
"Yes, what about him?" growled
"Kid" Trojan with half a sandwich
smothering most of the belligerent
tone of his voice.
"He's the best sprinter in the
country. That's what he is! Frankic
Wvkoff's chicken to race him."
"He's not."
"He is."
"He's not."
"He is."
Stanley Indian looked at Gin-Gin
and myself appcalingly, the while
muttering some words like: "Hables
. . . broken ribs . . . sprained ankle
. . . sinus trouble . . . tapeworm . . .
pulled muscle . .
When Gin-Gin and I left the table
for the next dance Stanley had
fallen into a coma repeating over
and over: "Hables . . . broken ribs
. . . sprained ankle . . . sinus trouble
. . . tapeworm . . . pulled muscle."
And so on for hours and hours
until at last the Hollywood Terror
began to get tired of "Kid" Trojan
treading on her toes (for the "Kid"
had started dancing). But when we
finally left, "Kid" Trojan was still
boasting loudly, "Goldie" Bear was
still patting everyone confidently on
the back, while Stanley Indian
seemed to have at last caught the
spirit of the occasion and had begun
to talk a bit less dejectedly about
the Fresno Relays, the 1.C.4-A., and
the Olympic Games.
