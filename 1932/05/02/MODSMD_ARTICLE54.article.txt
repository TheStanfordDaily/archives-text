# Stanford Tennis Squad Completes Hard Season
## 
### JULIUS JACOBS 
With the Stanford tennis season I
finished, hopes for a western inter-"
collegiate championship have been
dashed to the ground.
At the start of the season, with
Gledhill, Coughlin, and a strong
group of racket wielders in Forbes,
Weesner, Otis and Ellis, prospects
looked very bright.
Then Cosgrove turned out after
j laying aside his basketball suit, and
I Coach Lockwood had a potential
I championship team. In practice
I matches the varsity appeared strong,
I splitting even in two matches with
| the California Tennis Club, of San
Francisco. The features of these
matches weer the two clean-cut vic
■ tories by Coughlin over Gerald
| Straford, a state ranking player.
] Next they defeated the Burlingame
I Tennis Club, and with this pre
season experience were ready for a
j season of tough competition.
j The varsity men succeeded in
j coming through as expected to beat
i Southern California in their first
j clash. The southern team used a
| rather new system of tennis in put
i ting their seeded players near the
i bottom in the ranking singles
i matches and allowing the weaker
I men to play the first few singles. By
! this method they probably figured to
1 win a majority of the matches, but

| their strategem failed.
1 Against U.C.L.A. the team re
peated their win with Gledhill beat
ing their number one man, Tidball,
in decisive fashion. The so-called big
meet with California gave no serious
competition as the victory was very
i one-sided,
But at this point Lady Fortune
• changed. Gledhill decided to enter
. the tournament, in Hawaii as pan: of
his early season campaign, and Cos
• grove, a consistent winner, was or
, dered to quit activity for the re
i j mainder of the season because of a
l j kidney ailment.
■ I This necessitated a change in the
I doubles combinations, and Coughlin
I j came up as number one man. The
. j new teams in a practice match
> j against Pomona played fine tennis to
• | gain a 7-0 victory.
i | It was necessary for Stanford t«
! win one of her two matches against
i | the southern teams to remain in a
; | tie for first place. In this event,
: ; Gledhill would have been home in
i time for the playoff, evening chances
■ , up.
; j On March 15 and 1G Stanford faced
; the hard test of two gruelling
•: matches played on fast concrete
• courts, and lost twice in decisive fa
> shion to eliminate herself from first
1j place.

finished, hopes for a western inter-"
collegiate championship have been

looked very bright.
