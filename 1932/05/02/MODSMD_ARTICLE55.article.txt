# REDSHIRT GOLFERS SCORE SURPRISING TOURNAMENT WINS
## Charlie Seaver Triumphs Over Charlie Ferrera In Hard Tussle 
### 
Stanford golfing stock went
booming over the week-end as two
local golfers came home with Bay
Region tournament titles.
Down at San Jose, Charlie Seaver
won the Northern California Ama
teur championship by defeating the
national public links king, Charley
Ferrera. In the meantime his team
mate, Herman Hellman, was
crowned Oakland city champion,
because his opponent in the finals,
Roy Wiggins, was declared ineligible
for competition due to his profes
sional standing.
Glorious Victory
The glorious victory, however, j
went to Seaver, the sophomore who !
turned back a national champion |
one up over a 36-hole route. From i
the very beginning, the outcome I
seemed evident. The Stanford star
was three up at the first turn, ,
registering a 71, one over par, for
the eighteen holes, while Ferrera
rolled up 75.
His lead increased to 5 up at the
28th green, but then something hap
pened. Ferrera came back to win
the 29th, they halved the next, and
then Ferrera continued to win the
next four holes and even up the
match with two holes to go.
Eagle on 35th
Seaver took his time on the 35th
He had gone through all kinds of
trouble on the last few holes, but
Ferrera's spurt was over; that was
evident when Seaver took an eagle
three on the par five hole. One up
and one hole to go, Seaver halved
the 36th with his opponent.
Scores:
Seaver 71-70—147
Ferrera 75-74—14!)
Lawson Little, former Stanford
star and defending titleholder in the
San Jose tourney, couldn't cope
I with the fast-coming Seaver in
j Saturday morning's play and lost
i four down and three to go.
Hoffman Falls
! In the afternoon, Charlie won
I from Ralph Hoffman of Castlewood
! 3 and 2, while Ferrera was beating
! Stuart Heatley, U.C. ace, 2 and 1.
Hellman's match with Wiggins had
been frequently postponed due to
conflicting dates of other golf tour
i naments. The announcement that
j Wiggins would no longer be recog
j nized as an amateur came as quite
! a shock to those who were looking
forward to this final play-off be
i tween the two men who had beaten
' the best that the Bay Region had
| to offer.

Stanford golfing stock went
booming over the week-end as two
local golfers came home with Bay
Region tournament titles.
Down at San Jose, Charlie Seaver
won the Northern California Ama
teur championship by defeating the
national public links king, Charley
Ferrera. In the meantime his team
mate, Herman Hellman, was
crowned Oakland city champion,
because his opponent in the finals,
Roy Wiggins, was declared ineligible
for competition due to his profes
sional standing.
Glorious Victory
The glorious victory, however, j
went to Seaver, the sophomore who !
turned back a national champion |
one up over a 36-hole route. From i
the very beginning, the outcome I
seemed evident. The Stanford star
was three up at the first turn, ,
registering a 71, one over par, for
the eighteen holes, while Ferrera
rolled up 75.
His lead increased to 5 up at the
28th green, but then something hap
pened. Ferrera came back to win
the 29th, they halved the next, and
then Ferrera continued to win the
next four holes and even up the
match with two holes to go.
Eagle on 35th
Seaver took his time on the 35th
He had gone through all kinds of
trouble on the last few holes, but
Ferrera's spurt was over; that was
evident when Seaver took an eagle
three on the par five hole. One up
and one hole to go, Seaver halved
the 36th with his opponent.
Scores:
Seaver 71-70—147
Ferrera 75-74—14!)
Lawson Little, former Stanford
star and defending titleholder in the
San Jose tourney, couldn't cope
I with the fast-coming Seaver in
j Saturday morning's play and lost
i four down and three to go.
