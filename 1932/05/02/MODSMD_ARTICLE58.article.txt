# Relay Teams Break Marks
## Pennsylvania Four Turns In 3: 15.4 Mile 
### 
Brilliant mid-season performances,
topped by Ben Eastman's winning
times in the Stanford-U.S.C. dual
meet, were the rule rather than the
exception on the national track
schedule for Friday and Saturday.
Climaxing the annual Penn Relay
Carnival, University of Pennsyl
vania's great one-mile relay team
turned in the fastest relay race of
the year, covering the four laps in
3 minutes, 15.4 seconds, and break
ing their own meet record by over
two seconds.
Ralph Metcalfe, Marquette Uni
versity sophomore, stamped himself
as a definite Olympic Games possi
bility by racing through 100 yards in
9.5 seconds to tie Eddie Tolan's rec
ognized world's record for the event.
Frank Wykoff turned in the next
fastest time of the day in the U.S.C.
meet, running 9.7 seconds.
Two of the best American hurdlers
ran to exceptional times in the 120-
yard high hurdles. George Saling
raced the highs in 14.4 seconds, the
fastest time of the 1932 season, while
Jack Keller, generally considered
America's greatest hurdler, won at
the Penn relays in 14.8 seconds, and
then came back to race a lap of
14.3 seconds in the 480-yard high
hurdle shuttle relay.
Nelson Gray of Stanford, with a
winning put of 50 feet, 6 inches,
turned in the best shot put record
of the day, but winners at the Penn
Relays and Drake Relays also ex
ceeded 50 feet, forecasting a tremen
dous battle for shot put honors in
the national meets this summer.
The lace curtain is gradually dis
appearing in Great Britain.
