# Polo Men Trample Loyola Squad 17-0
## Stanford Riders Run Record Score in Encounter Against Los Angeles Outfit Saturday 
### 
! D UNNING up a record score for the season, the Stanford polo team
trampled over the Loyola College squad to ride away with an easy
! 17 to 0 victory in a six chukker polo match last Saturday afternoon on
1 the local field. Even with the absence of two varsity men, Captain Bruce
I Fleming and Peter Lewis, who played in the match that won the Coast
j Low-Goal championship two weeks ago, the four horsemen from the
; Farm played a smooth, overpowering game.

The Los Angeles outfit was out
ridden and outplayed from the
start. With this their first year of
competition, Loyola lacked any
semblance of teamwork and con
sequently failed to furnish the
Cards with any real competition.
Spalding Fills In
Rufus Spalding, playing at his
new number four position for the
Redshirts, walloped the ball through
the uprights for five goals. Spalding
was shifted from his regular posi
tion at number two to take the
place of Captain Fleming, who was
injured last week in practice.
With Spalding fitting in so well
at the back position, Stanford has a
player who can fill in at Fleming's
place in case Fleming's injury keeps
him out of any future games.
Gillham Brilliant
Pete Gillham, the only varsity
player who was in the game, played
some brilliant polo at number two.
Gillham chalked up three goals in
the first three ehukkers, and was
then replaced by Ed Boyles. Boyles
cracked through two more goals be
i fore the end of the game.
Bothered somewhat by an injured
leg, Woody Melone still managed to
play a fast game at number three.
Parker Holt, up at number one,
made some sensational shots to add
three more tallies to the Card's
string.
