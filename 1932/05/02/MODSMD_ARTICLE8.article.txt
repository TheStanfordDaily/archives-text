# Strawberry To Reign At Y.W. May Breakfast
## 
### 
May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,
but it's Strawberry day on the Stan
ford Quad. From 7:30 o'clock this
morning until 2:00 o'clock in the af
ternoon the annual Y.W.C.A. May
Day breakfast, featuring the tradi
tional strawberry shortcake with
plenty of whipped cream, supported
by that good old American standby,
hot coffee, will be served.
The Union Court will be trans
formed for the occasion, with tables
set with food for merry-makers sur
rounding the famous fountain.
Y.W.C.A. committee members will
serve and it will only cost 35 cents
per person to enjoy the feast of a
life-time. The proceeds of the sale
are to be used to pay the Y.W.C.A.
national dues.
This May breakfast is one of the
Stanford traditions that seems to be
here to stay. Kay Spaulding, presi
dent of the "Y," plans that this
year's feed will be the best in his
tory. Miss Spaulding is being assisted
in the work on the breakfast by her
cabinet and Mrs. Ben S. Allen,
Y.W.C.A. secretary.
