# INDIANS SHARE TROJAN GLORY DESPITE LOSS
## Gus Meier Runs Star Race But Finishes 14 Inches Behind S.C. Rivals 
### 
Young Gus Meier ran "the two
fastest hurdle flights of his life last
Saturday afternoon. Young Gus
would have won the highs in the
nationally known Pennsylvania re
lays held on that same date. Young
Gus's time was the best recorded
by a Stanford high hurdler in quite
some time, and yet young Gus
didn't get even one measly little
point in the Stanford-too-much-
U.S.C. track dual.
Meier finished exactly 14 inches
(official Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerse Survey Committee) be
hind the winner of the highs and
didn't place. He was timed in 14.8,
which would be headline news if
any other sophomore hurdler did it
anywhere else, and yet he couldn't
get better than fourth. Gus ran the
lows in 23.7, which has won more
than one national meet, and yet in
an "ordinary" dual trackfest he was
beaten out of third by the thickness
of Carls' jersey.
Meier's experience was that of
several Stanford athletes who found
ihe Trojans just a bit too much for
their best efforts. His case is a bit
different, however, as his remark
able improvement from a good but
not startling freshman to a great
sophomore promises much in the
rest of this season's meets and in
those of 1933 and 1934.
Gray Good
Take the: case of Nellie Gray.
Nellie threw the discus 152 feet and
also didn't place. If he happened to
be going to some Eastern school in
stead of one located on the Pacific
Coast, he would have won this
event in the Penn relays by nine
feet and at Drake by 48 inches. In
cidentally. ibis same Mr. Gray made
ap. unofficial toss of 51. feet 2 inches
in the shot-put after the regular
event was finished.
Then there is shuffling 01 lie Am
dahl, like Meier only a sophomore.
Amdahl ran two miles in the vi
cinity of 9 minutes and 42 seconds,
less than three seconds slower than
the Big Meet mark, and lost out to
Callahan of the Trojans by some
thing like a yard. "Runs two miles
to lose by yard"—what a headline!
•I's of Inch Loses
And while on the subject of
strange occurrences in that Trojan-
Indian meet: Al Ray lost the javelin
by five-eighths of an inch . . . .
National Champion Bill Grabcr
didn't place in the pole-vault . . \ .
someone threw a track shoe at
Wallv Butler while he was broad
jumping and another (or perhaps
the same one) at Bill Werder . . . .
Ralph Giberson lost second place to
Ball of U.S.C. in the 100 by appar
ently nothing and did the same in
the 220 to Dolby .... Captain Al
vin Hables was timed in 49.5 for
his relay lap .... AND Ben East
man broke the accepted world's
quarter-mile record twice.
