# Farm Boasts Penal Colony Hoosegow Traps Lockouts, Egg Hurlers Convalescent Home Profits

### COLLIER CONNELL 
Campus Penal Institution —this is
an outstanding role of the Stanford
Convalescent Home. And many
are the paths thereto.
A time-clock kept in the office of
i Miss Ruth Spande, head nurse of
' the Home, bears mute evidence of
1 the toiling rough.
Certain entree to the local hoose
i gow is guaranteed by Enema spon
sors on the following counts: Hurl
ing eggs, oranges, bread, bottles
empty or full of ink, across Encina
bullpen. Loud fisticuffs in the halls.
Tampering with the fire hose. Un
justified uproar during quiet hours.
Four hours of work at the Con
valescent Home is the minor pen
alty of those inflicted on a half
, score freshmen at every two-week

| court session of Encina sponsors.
Small firecracker warrants six |
i hours, a large firecracker goes for ;
the category of hurled milk bottles,
I if guilty of success.
Highest penalty inflicted this year '
|al frosh headquarters—2s hours—
i fell to an enthusiastic sniper who ,
was quietly picking off his neigh- i
bor collegians with a B-B gun.
i For Stanford's 500, the Home .
serves as a handy jug. Five to fif- |
teen hours are handed out in lib- j
eral sentences by Women's Council. |
Lockouts provide the largest reve- 1
nue. Among other offenses on rec- j
old are a revival meeting honfire
in a Roble wastebasket; and shoot-I
ing what was reputed to he marbles j
in the corridor during finals week. |
