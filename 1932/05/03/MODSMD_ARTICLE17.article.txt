# Shovel Brigade Toils Tomorrow To Help Charity
## Barbecue, Dance To Follow Yearly Labor Day 
### 
Wednesday: Annual Labor
Day at the Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children. After
noon classes will be dismissed.

Announcing a half-holiday be
ginning at noon tomorrow, the ad
ministration has made possible what
is expected to be the most colorful
Labor Day ever held on the grounds
of the Convalescent Home.
Work Starts at 1 o'Clock
Franklin Gribben, chairman of
the day's events, has asked all his
committees to report at the Home
at 12:45 o'clock so that work can
begin promptly at 1 o'clock. From
then until 4:30 o'clock, all students
will serve voluntary time on the
famed "woodpile"—their tasks in
cluding washing windows, mowing
lawns, raking roads, chopping wood,
repairing toys, painting playhouses,
and disposing of rubbish.
To facilitate these various tasks,
all living groups are requested to
bring their own shovels, axes, rakes,
saws, and hoes.
With this work completed, the
clean-up committee will take charge
and restore the Home to its original
peace and calm.
Dinner, Dance Planned
After the labor is done, the fea
ture event of the day will attract all
workers to the pits for Sam Mac-
Donald's widely noted barbecued
lamb, with the extra trimmings of
salad, ice cream, and all that goes
with it. Then, under the direction
of Bernarr Bates, will come an
hour of entertainment, with well
known campus stars appearing in a
series of short skits.
At 7 o'clock, the Pavilion will be
thrown open—at 25 cents apiece—
for a two-hour all-University jolly
up. Craig's Cardinals nine-piece or
chestra has been selected to provide
music for this "Below Depression"
dance, the final event of the day.
