SAN FRANCISCO, May 3. </P>—
>r. Joseph Catton, San Francisco
sychiatrist who testified for the
rosecution in the Massie-Fortescue
under case, returned from Hawaii
esterday on the Dollar liner Presi
ent Hoover and scored the defense
>r "incompetence."
"Lieutenant Massic was sane at
le time of the killing," said Dr.
at ton. "It was a great mistake to
ave recourse to an insanity plea
hen the 'unwritten law' would al
iost certainly have freed all four
•fendants.
"I honestly expected a hung jury,
hat the mixed jury did bring in a
•rdict of guilty of manslaughter is
•oof to me that my first observa
ons of the jury were correct. I
>u Id see that their reaction was to
ic guilt or innocence of Kahaha
ai. If they had been convinced that
ie Hawaiian was the leader of the
ing that attacked Mrs. Massie, they
ould have turned in a verdict of
lot guilty."
