The rea: 11 Ihal the problem of continuing the Concert!
Scries is being put (o a campus vole is that I lie Executive!
(lommillee believed lhat (lie students should have the linal J
say as to whether or not they should risk their funds to
support the Series. All students should vote today on the'
continuation of the Series that the result may he a true;
expression of the campus opinion and not merely the de-j
sires of a small group.
In the Friday and Monday issues of the Daily Helen
I'llman, manager of the Concert Series and Albert Denney, i
student manager, presented their views on the problem.!
Denncy's objections to the Series are, of course, purely i
financial. He pointed out lhat the Series will incur a large j
delicto this year which will have to he made up out of the
A.S.S.I*, funds and that the immediate financial success of
the concerts is uncertain.
.Miss I'llman presented a budget for next year's Series I
based on this year's income which should be a safe esti- i
mate. She also maintained that in view of the desirability !
of having such a Series on the campus, the students should
be willing to pay for a deficit lhat might occur during ab-j
normal times, the amount being paid back to the student
fund during more profitable years from the income of the i
Series.
There is no doubt as to the value of the Series to Stan
lord. It looks as though it will be financially sound but
this is never a certainly. A large turnout at the polls will |
settle this question as far as tlie students are concerned and
will provide a constructive basis for future action.
