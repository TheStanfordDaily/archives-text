# TROY'S INDIAN SIGN
## 
### 
The cold, horrible truth was clinchcd lor all time 011 the j
Olympic Stadium turf Saturday afternoon. The Trojans
HAN K an Indian sign on Stanford. No, not because they
won again on the track. That was inevitable and incidental i
to the linal vindication of suspicions lhat an Indian sign, j
whatever that is, reposed within the athletic walls of Troy, i
There can be no question about the superiority of the
entire Trojan team; but, by all the gods from Zeus to the;
lowliest, the Daii.y will not admit that Troy has a better
javelin thrower than has the Farm. Five-eight lis of an inch! 1
It used to be common knowledge that wherever there 1
was an inch difference anywhere in Slanford-r.S.C. com- j
petition, Ihal infinitesimal balance was invariably in favor]
of the southerners. J ill t when they start winning UM-foot '
throws by a fraction, then it is time for them to come right
out in the open and show us just what an Indian sign is,;
and where they got it.
As though that were not enough, later in the afternoon
Dean Cromwell brought out a flock of hurdlers who shut!
Stanford's star hurdler completely out of the point column,
even though he ran 1 I.<X in the highs and 2.'i./ in the lows
b\ the unfailing slop walcli of Hill Ellington. A yard be- j
bind the leader in llie shorter barrier event, four feet in !
back of the winner of the longer one; and no better than a
fourth in each race!
Come come, Troy, let's have it. Is this a game?
