# NUDISTS-POLICE-ITCH

### 
I 11'.' long-suflering Doukliobors, whose curious religion
impels tlirm to walk about minus the conventional cover- !
ing of clothes, have been getting into trouble with the Brit- j
isll Columbia police again. Attempting to stage a nudist
parade recently, they were set upon by unfeeling minions |
of Ihe law, beaten with garden hose, and, unkindest cut of!
all, sprayed with itch powder!
II seems unfortunate that the uneasy consciences of the ;
I )oukhobors do not permit tliein to confine their nudist ac- j
tivities to the privacy of their homes, or to move to an area I
whose inhabitants are less strait-laced than are our neigh-j
bors to the north.
At least, they might try to find some more refilled cops, j
(iardeu hose could be excused; il is probably better than
a night stick. Bill il is going a little far to use itch powder ;
on unclad cilizcns. There is something crude, not to say
vulgar, about thai parliciilar pulverized commodity. One
would not care to tell one's friends that one had been
spraved with ilch powder. II does not enhance the aura of
dignilv that should hedge anyone bearing Ihe fearsome
title of "I)oukliobor."
The oppressed bretheren should try Onrmel. A nudist'
colony nourished lh< r< for some time. Or, better yel, they
might move lo Los Angeles, that haven for all Ihe queer j
oroide of Ibis queer world,
