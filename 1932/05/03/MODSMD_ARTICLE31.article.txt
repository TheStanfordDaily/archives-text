# BULL SESSION
## THE 						CONCERT SERIES 
### 
; Today, it is hoped that the student
I body will march to the polls and
decide what to do about the Con
cert Series. In reality a few persons
particularly wrought up on either
side of the question will place
1 vigorous "X's" on their ballot —the
I votes will be counted—the A.S.S.U.
I will accept that decision. The 500
! or so students who will vote have
j the fate of this cultural project bc
i tween their thumb and forefinger.
Everybody hopes they will scjuecze
in the right direction.
Despite A1 Denney's businesslike
! report—loaded with figures and sta-
I tistics, it does seem that our Student
! Manager has failed to look beyond
j the digits. In the world of com-
I merce, red ink is even more infuri
: ating than the red flag. Therefore, it
it reasoned that because the Con
! cert Series dropped in the hole this
year, we must in return drop the
Series out of a ten-story window.
Fair play as it were.
That this is an unreasonable con
clusion is evidenced by the nature
of the Concert Series. It is a cul
tural asset to the University—some
thing that is well worth a reason
able loss. We support many things
J around here that continually drain
I the student funds. The number of
j sports, besides football, that are
i self-supporting could be counted on
j the fingers of an armless man or
i even a woman, as the case may be.
! Year after year, the sporting Oliver
| Twists come asking for some of the
j porridge that has boiled over from
] the football pot. Never are they re
i fused. No one even suggests a vote.
But because the Concert Series
i over a period of six years has cost
the students a grand total of a little
j over one thousand dollars, the Ex
| ecutive Committee has presumed to
[ make this worthy cause suffer the

| humiliation of fighting for its life
before the electorate. That the Ex
i Comm. should not have taken the
| initiative itself in saving something
I that does appeal to a minority, is
I distressingly unusual. No one would
consider voting on many other
j minority interests around this cam
pus.
But even on a cold business basis,
j the Concert Series merits a "yes"
I today. No one drops a business ven
j lure on one year's loss—especially
i when that loss comes in a year of
i unprecedented depression. It they
! did, the nation this year would
; practically he void of business ven
-1 tures of any kind. With better times
i around the corner —they must be
better because a national election is
lin the offing—we can expect the
i Concert Series to pull out of this
j deficit. In the fat years that are to
I come, they may even build a sur-
I plus.
Vote "YES" today to keep some
j music on the campus. There is no
I other music but the Concert Series
i unless one calls these drum beaters,
! and saxophone bleaters, purveyors
jof music. —Abe Mellinkoff

in the right direction.
Despite A1 Denney's businesslike
! report—loaded with figures and sta-
I tistics, it does seem that our Student
! Manager has failed to look beyond
j the digits. In the world of com-
I merce, red ink is even more infuri
: ating than the red flag. Therefore, it
it reasoned that because the Con
! cert Series dropped in the hole this
year, we must in return drop the
Series out of a ten-story window.
Fair play as it were.
That this is an unreasonable con
clusion is evidenced by the nature
of the Concert Series. It is a cul
tural asset to the University—some
thing that is well worth a reason
able loss. We support many things
J around here that continually drain
I the student funds. The number of
j sports, besides football, that are
i self-supporting could be counted on
j the fingers of an armless man or
i even a woman, as the case may be.
! Year after year, the sporting Oliver
| Twists come asking for some of the
j porridge that has boiled over from
] the football pot. Never are they re
i fused. No one even suggests a vote.
But because the Concert Series
i over a period of six years has cost
the students a grand total of a little
j over one thousand dollars, the Ex
| ecutive Committee has presumed to
[ make this worthy cause suffer the

| humiliation of fighting for its life
before the electorate. That the Ex
i Comm. should not have taken the
| initiative itself in saving something
I that does appeal to a minority, is
I distressingly unusual. No one would
consider voting on many other
j minority interests around this cam
pus.
But even on a cold business basis,
j the Concert Series merits a "yes"
I today. No one drops a business ven
j lure on one year's loss—especially
i when that loss comes in a year of
i unprecedented depression. It they
! did, the nation this year would
; practically he void of business ven
-1 tures of any kind. With better times
i around the corner —they must be
better because a national election is
lin the offing—we can expect the
i Concert Series to pull out of this
j deficit. In the fat years that are to
I come, they may even build a sur-
I plus.
Vote "YES" today to keep some
j music on the campus. There is no
I other music but the Concert Series
i unless one calls these drum beaters,
! and saxophone bleaters, purveyors
jof music. —Abe Mellinkoff
; Today, it is hoped that the student
I body will march to the polls and
decide what to do about the Con
cert Series. In reality a few persons
particularly wrought up on either
side of the question will place
1 vigorous "X's" on their ballot —the
I votes will be counted—the A.S.S.U.
I will accept that decision. The 500
! or so students who will vote have
j the fate of this cultural project bc
i tween their thumb and forefinger.
Everybody hopes they will scjuecze
in the right direction.
