ANSWERINC, MELLINKOFF
'The Editor, Sir:
In response to your recent essay,
labeled "Necking and Romance," I
find no small cause for friction, and,
begging your pardon, I shall take
; the liberty of criticizing your ap
j parently rabid point of view.
I You say that "necking" is none
j other than an exhibition of our
j basic animal instincts. I grant that
! you are perhaps right because there
; are those confirmed and incor
j rigable "lounge-lizards" who play
I their parlor games for the indul
j gence of their own sensuous pleas
i ure only. Their very promiscuity
| shows the absence of any love; and
their interest being wholly indiffer
j ent, there is no love to be alienated.
! This rather disproves your belief
that "necking" destroys all romance.
I Now let vis look at the other side
of the question where love is actu
ally present and flourishing: How,
I if at all, do you intend to show
your feelings? Would you sit there
! | beside your lady-love gazing soul
-1 fully for hours on end? Of course
' you wouldn't! Or would you heap
• gifts and favors upon her? This lat
' ter would, to put it mildly, be rather
economically impractical! Don't for
! get that real love can't be bought,
i To prove that love is independent
! of "necking," you cited "the letters
of Ellen Terry and George Bernard
Shaw" as a proof. May I suggest to
; you, Mr. Mellinkoff, that there is
an old maxim telling us that all
' ' rules have their exceptions. Your
. j example is none other than one of
i ! these exceptions.
Another thing that I noticed, Mr.
j Mellinkoff, in your counter disser
! tation on the gentle art of "neck
! ing," was that not once did you
! give this innocent pastime a chance
, to stand for itself, nor did you give
! ; anyone else a chance to stand for it!
; So, as a fitting close to my tardy
i criticism of your apparently errone

ous remarks, may I ask, "How do
you manifest your deep emotion'."
—W. D. Waltman
