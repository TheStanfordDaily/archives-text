# THAT CONCERT SERIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Everybody, I take it, would like
a Concert Series to be a feature of
our community life. But the prac
tical question, as some seem to see
it, is this: Shall the students take
the responsibility of meeting defi
cits, if they occur, while Palo Alto
people reap the advantages of the
concerts without taking responsi
bility? I have been so closely in
touch with the situation through
twenty years that I can, I think,
fairly represent Palo Alto opinion.
The answer to the question is
simple: If the students do their
part, Palo Alto people will do theirs,
and we can continue to enjoy con
certs. Let us see, in the light of
experience, what justification there
is for the view.
For about fifteen years Palo Alto,
through the Peninsula Musical As
sociation, sponsored concerts on the
campus. The situation was then re
versed. The students had the privi
lege of going to the concerts, and if
there were deficits, as there were,
Palo Alto paid and paid without
complaint. Then students, on their
own initiative, started their own
series. The Peninsula series failed,
as a consequence, and Palo Alto
transferred its loyal support to the
students' series. For some years the
new series, under student manage

merit, succeeded; and now for the
first time a deficit appears. How are
we to look at the situation?
Several things are to be remem
bered:
(1) The students have taken a
i legitimate prjde in their accom
plishment, and if they can establish
I the series permanently, it will be a
; .still further source of pride.
(2) Since it would be plaintly il
j logical for the students, assuming
' all the responsibility for manage
j merit, to pass all the responsibility
for possible mismanagement to Palo
Alto, no such proposal has been
made.
(j) A plan of active co-operation
| between the students and Palo Alto,
| however, is easily possible. Practi
j cal methods for such co-operation
j have, indeed, been tentatively
worked out in conferences between
I the student management and repre
; senlatives of Palo Alto.
(4) The active co-operation of
1 Palo Alto has never before been
asked. The Board of Advisers has
j been only a list of names on paper.
Co-operation, then, will have the
advantage of keeping the prestige
lof practical management with the
students. There seem to be three
j good reasons why it can be a suc
cess, without involving the students
< in further debts:
(1) The general depression that
! has worked against the series this
year is a crisis to be met., not a
lasting condition to deal with.
(2) A four-concert series for next
year can so reduce the budget that
even with no improvement in in
come the series can be continued
without further debt. Any increase
in income will be clear gain to the
i student bodv.

I (3) Palo Alto's interest in the
concerts is so sincere that the city
will, when the need becomes known,
rally to the support of the series in
an effective way. Experienced work
ers are available for a spring cam
-1 paign. Community generosity is
shown by the response of the city
ito the call from the San Francisco
Symphony. Though illness this last
week has kept me at home, I spoke
to three neighbors yesterday, and
i each one welcomed heartily the
I idea of taking extra tickets in the
i interest of those who could not
I otherwise afford to subscribe. At
every hand I see evidence of strong
i local support for the concerts if the
students keep the series going and
! give us the chance to co-operate
with them. â€”S. S. Seward, Jr.
