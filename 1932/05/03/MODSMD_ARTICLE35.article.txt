# PROFESSOR JONES FAVORS PROPOSED OIL CONTROL ACT
## Economist Believes Passage Of Sharkey Bill Would Stabilize Prices 
### 
Allaying many of the misconcep
tions concerning the Sharkey oil
control bill to be voted on by the
California electorate today, Eliot
Jones, Professor of Economics and
: uthor of several textbooks on pub
lic utilities, stated that he favored
the adoption of this referendum
measure by the voters of the Golden
State.
The Sharkey Bill was passed by
both houses of the state legislature
and was signed by Governor Rolph
in 1931. Through the referendum, it
is to be submitted as Proposition
No. 1 to be retained by California
voters in the Presidential Primary
Election today. It is designated as
an Oil Contract Act, which proposes
the creation of an oil and gas com
mission of five members, selected by
the oil producers of the state, and
an oil and gas supervisor, appointed
by the governor, to prohibit the
waste of crude petroleum oil.
In an interview yesterday Jones
decried the misleading propaganda
which has been published in an at
tempt to sway public opinion
against the bill. This publicity has
pictured the major oil companies as
stifling the independent producers
in order to extort an exorbitant
price from the consumer.
''The Sharkey Bill can in no way
lie interpreted as an attempt of the
major producers to usurp the oil
business," said Jones. "It has been
proposed as a necessary conserva
tion act to preserve the oil resources
of California. The campaign waged
against the measure is a result of
the desire of certain independent
producers to escape regulation.
"Wasteful production has charac
terized the oil industry. In order to
prevent the exploitation of Califor
nia's great natural resource, many
independent producers as well as
the major companies desire to have
r x body of five commissioners to
regulate production. The major
companies will be outvoted by the
independent producers in the se
lection of these commissioners, and
it all times the Oil and Gas Super
visor, to be appointed by the Gov
ernor, may veto any action which
•vould be detrimental to the public."
The statement that the passage of
he Sharkey Bill would lead to high
lasoline prices was held to be falla
cious by Jones, because Eastern
gasoline can be imported to com
ae te with Western gasoline if the
orice of the latter is raised too high.
Tones, along with many prominent
California economists, believes that
he Oil Control Act will aid in the
stabilization of oil prices through its
prevention of overproduction.

No. 1 to be retained by California
voters in the Presidential Primary
Election today. It is designated as
an Oil Contract Act, which proposes
the creation of an oil and gas com
mission of five members, selected by
the oil producers of the state, and
an oil and gas supervisor, appointed
by the governor, to prohibit the
waste of crude petroleum oil.
In an interview yesterday Jones
decried the misleading propaganda
which has been published in an at
tempt to sway public opinion
against the bill. This publicity has
pictured the major oil companies as
stifling the independent producers
in order to extort an exorbitant
price from the consumer.
''The Sharkey Bill can in no way
lie interpreted as an attempt of the
major producers to usurp the oil
business," said Jones. "It has been
proposed as a necessary conserva
tion act to preserve the oil resources
of California. The campaign waged
against the measure is a result of
the desire of certain independent
producers to escape regulation.
"Wasteful production has charac
terized the oil industry. In order to
prevent the exploitation of Califor
nia's great natural resource, many
independent producers as well as
the major companies desire to have
r x body of five commissioners to
regulate production. The major
companies will be outvoted by the
independent producers in the se
lection of these commissioners, and
it all times the Oil and Gas Super
visor, to be appointed by the Gov
ernor, may veto any action which
•vould be detrimental to the public."
The statement that the passage of
he Sharkey Bill would lead to high
lasoline prices was held to be falla
cious by Jones, because Eastern
gasoline can be imported to com
ae te with Western gasoline if the
orice of the latter is raised too high.
Tones, along with many prominent
California economists, believes that
he Oil Control Act will aid in the
stabilization of oil prices through its
prevention of overproduction.
