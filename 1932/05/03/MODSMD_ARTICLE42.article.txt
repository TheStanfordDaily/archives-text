# ORAL EXAMS ARE SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR U.S. STUDENT
## Dr. Robert C. Swain Gives Views On Universities In German States 
### 
Oral examinations and lack of
check-up on attendance at foreign
universities are the greatest prob- ,
lems facing the American student
abroad, in the opinion of Dr. Rob
ert C. Swain, son of the acting
president, who has recently re- 1
turned from a year's study in Ger
many.
In discussing his experiences, Dr. i
Swain said that despite his two j
years of German at Stanford, he was i
unable to understand a word of the :
foreign language when he arrived
in Germany. It took him just six
months to be able to appreciate the j
lectures.
In his opinion, studying abroad is !
of advantage because of the famous i
scientists, such as Haber and Ein- j
stein, that the student has the!
chance to work with, as well as the !
cultural advantages obtained — a i
student can get a good seat at the I
Berlin opera for as little as 50 cents. I
The cost of living is about the same i
there as here.
When asked for his most interest- j
ing experience, he said it was a visit:
to one of the largest chemical plants '
in Germany. This plant employs!
twenty-five thousand men, includ
ing eighty chemists,' all with Ph.D.'s,
who receive the princely salary of |
$65 per month. At this plant over
10,000 tons of gasoline are manu- J
factured from brown coal annually. |
