ANYBODY WHO lias ever played I
that interesting little parlor game j
known in the vernacular us "black ;
jack" has some conception of how j
various members of Stanford's track j
and field team feel after that meet
at Los Angeles Saturday.
The Terrible Trojan dealer just :
wouldn't go bust.
There was Nellie Gray in the dis- |
CU s—he heaved the platter over 150 j
feet, but didn't even place. If you've j
ever "stood" on 20 and then hud the j
dealer come along with 21, you'l!
understand how Nellie felt.
Then there was A1 Ray, who was j
dealt a 10 and an ace, and was all
ready for the pay-off, but the dealer
had a black jack. Ray got the spear
out to 194 feet 4 inch, but on the j
last throw Williamson topped that |
by 5 h of an inch.
And Meier ran the two hurdle j
races faster than he ever had before, ,
but still he couldn't get in the i
money.
Black jack is a lousy game, any- 1
how!
THEY WILL have a very dif
ficult time in laughing «>IT those
records of Ben Eastman, those
doubting Thomases of the East, j
Knowing that he had two tough
races ahead. Ben just "coasted"
in to win the 440 Saturday in j
the modest time of 17.1 seconds.
Running around TWO curves,
Ben had beaten Ted Meredith's
yet official record for the dis- !
tanee by three-tenths of a sec- j
ond—and he was taking it easy! |
He merely loafed in the half
mile to win in 1:53.8, and then
came back in the relay to run
the anchor lap in 4(5.7.
Laugh, clowns, laugh!

PICKING THE winner in the
Kentucky Derby isn't going to be
such an easy proposition after all.
Top Flight, the Whitney entry, was j
withdrawn yesterday after a poor
showing Saturday at Jamaica.
Until Saturday the filly was un- j
defeated and was a big favorite to i
win the mile and a quarter classic j
at Churchill Downs this week. Now
the race seems a wide-open affair,
as Burning Blaze, another favorite, i
has also been withdrawn because of j
injuries received in a race Saturday,
while Tick On and Liberty Limited !
are in doubtful shape, according to |
Associated Press dispatches.
Westerners will be watching Gal
lant Sir with interest. After clean- j
ing up at Tanforan, he was taken
to Louisville to get in shape for the
derby. There hasn't been much j
ballyhoo about Gallant Sir, but j
many who saw him at the San j
Bruno track are looking for him to j
surprise the Kentucky natives.

Westerners will be watching Gal
lant Sir with interest. After clean- j
ing up at Tanforan, he was taken
to Louisville to get in shape for the
derby. There hasn't been much j
ballyhoo about Gallant Sir, but j
many who saw him at the San j
Bruno track are looking for him to j
surprise the Kentucky natives.

!
ANYBODY WHO lias ever played I
that interesting little parlor game j
known in the vernacular us "black ;
jack" has some conception of how j
various members of Stanford's track j
and field team feel after that meet
at Los Angeles Saturday.
The Terrible Trojan dealer just :
wouldn't go bust.
There was Nellie Gray in the dis- |
CU s—he heaved the platter over 150 j
feet, but didn't even place. If you've j
ever "stood" on 20 and then hud the j
dealer come along with 21, you'l!
understand how Nellie felt.
Then there was A1 Ray, who was j
dealt a 10 and an ace, and was all
ready for the pay-off, but the dealer
had a black jack. Ray got the spear
out to 194 feet 4 inch, but on the j
last throw Williamson topped that |
by 5 h of an inch.
And Meier ran the two hurdle j
races faster than he ever had before, ,
but still he couldn't get in the i
money.
Black jack is a lousy game, any- 1
how!
THEY WILL have a very dif
ficult time in laughing «>IT those
records of Ben Eastman, those
doubting Thomases of the East, j
Knowing that he had two tough
races ahead. Ben just "coasted"
in to win the 440 Saturday in j
the modest time of 17.1 seconds.
Running around TWO curves,
Ben had beaten Ted Meredith's
yet official record for the dis- !
tanee by three-tenths of a sec- j
ond—and he was taking it easy! |
He merely loafed in the half
mile to win in 1:53.8, and then
came back in the relay to run
the anchor lap in 4(5.7.
Laugh, clowns, laugh!

PICKING THE winner in the
Kentucky Derby isn't going to be
such an easy proposition after all.
Top Flight, the Whitney entry, was j
withdrawn yesterday after a poor
showing Saturday at Jamaica.
Until Saturday the filly was un- j
defeated and was a big favorite to i
win the mile and a quarter classic j
at Churchill Downs this week. Now
the race seems a wide-open affair,
as Burning Blaze, another favorite, i
has also been withdrawn because of j
injuries received in a race Saturday,
while Tick On and Liberty Limited !
are in doubtful shape, according to |
Associated Press dispatches.
