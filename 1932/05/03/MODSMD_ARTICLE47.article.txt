Favored to win by a large margin, j
Coach Nort Thornton's undefeated j
freshman swimming team meets '
Menlo Junior College in the final j
contest of the season for the Indians j
at 3:45 o'clock today in the Encina !
pools.

about the total result, the meet I
should prove interesting in that I
Dick Hirsch, yearling sprint flash, j
will run into his toughest competi- j
tion of the season in the 50- and i
100-yard free style events. Henry 1
Godman, Jaysee star, won the j

year when he was swimming for
Palo Alto High School and has
equaled the best times made by

von Saltza has been making very
good time for the Menlo team in
the sprints.
Should Stanford win the dashes, !
there is little likelihood that'its rec- |
ord of only two first-place losses j
during the season will be broken, j
California freshmen and the San |
Francisco Y.M.C.A. each won a first j
in the breaststroke in earlier meets, j
Coach Thornton will use the fol- }
lowing men in today's events: |
dashes —Dick Hirsch, Chuck Boothe, !
