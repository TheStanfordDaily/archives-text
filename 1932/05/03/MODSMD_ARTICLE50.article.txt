(Editor's Note: This is the second of a series of articles on the coming
Olympic Games at Los Angeles.)

When the hundred or so sprinters
draw for heats before the Olympic
Games 100-meter championship this
summer, eight pairs of flying legs
loom as slightly faster than the rest.
They belong to E. L. Page of Eng
land; Percy Williams of Canada, ihe
defending champion; J. A. Joubei't
of England; Eugen Eldraeher and
Arthur Jonath of Germany; ond
Frank Wykoff, Tolan, and
Ralph Metcalfe of the United States.
All eight men have bettered Percy
Williams' Olympic record of 10.8
seconds, but for that matter so have
sprinters from nearly every country.
Arthur Jonath heads the greatest
sprinting contingent ever entered in
Olympic competition by one coun
try. Jonath ran 10.4 seconds in 1930
and 1931, and has consistently

j proved himself some two yards
i faster than any other sprinter in
. Europe. And the second best sprint
|er in Europe, Eugen Eldraeher, is
] also representing Germany. He has
been timed in 10.3 seconds, one
tenth faster than the recognized
j world's record for the event. Hel
mut Kornig, in 1928 the fastest Ger
j man runner, did 10.2 seconds with a
i wind (9.2 seconds for the 100-yard
| dash!), while Lammers, third-place
winner at Amsterdam, Corts, Brock
i meyer, and Geerling have all tied
! the world standard of 10.4 seconds.
