# CAMPUS STARS TO READ SATIRE
## Sherwood's 'Road to Rome' Given on Thursday 
### 
Robert Sherwood's smart satire, j
"The Road to Rome," is to be the j
second reading sponsored by Sword j
and Sandals, men's honorary dra- j
matic fraternity, at an open meet- \
ing at 7:30 o'clock next Thursday j
evening in the Little Theatre.
Dorothy Tully, who has appeared
in sevei'al campus productions, no
tably in ''Berkeley Square," will be
the Amytis, a difficult role acted in j
the original production by Jane
Cowl. Dorothy Tully's experience in
light comedies done here within the
past two years, Noel Coward's
"Young Idea" and '"The Mistress of
Briony," will serve her well here.
Bill Lyons, whose Stapp in "Wings
Over Europe" received much fa- j
vorable comment, is to read Hanni- j
bal, and Arthur Hurt, who has not j
been seen on the campus since "The J
Mistress of the Inn," will be Fabius I
Maximus.
Other roles will be read by Jack j
Jago, Jane Desenberg, Joseph Wolf, I
James Sandoe, and Edward Girzi. j
James Lyons will preside, reading !
necessary stage directions.
The play is a merciless attack |
upon rotarianism and the glory that j
was Rome. Sherwood employs mod- j
ern terms anachronistieally but to j
good comic effect. His wickedest I
lungij is at war when Amytis rea- j
sons with Hannibal, at the gates of |
Rome, after nine years of exhaust- ;
ing march, to abandon his conquest !
and thereby become truly great, i
This struggle between Amytis and j
Hannibal composes the greater part
of the play.
"The Road to Rome" was pro- I
duced in New York five years ago '
but has not shown age at all. It is j
sharp, rapid, momentarily serious j
satire and as such enjoyed long
runs both on Broadway and the
road. There is an unusually large
cast for the production and some
combinations have been necessary
for comfortable reading on the Lit -
tie Theatre stage. But the script re
mains practically uncut.
"Thursday's reading will begin
promptly as scheduled," said Val
lejo Gantner, president of the or
ganization, "so it will be appropri
ate, in view of the success of the
first reading, 'Private Lives,' to be
seated by 7:30 o'clock,"
