The new feature of the day, an
11-University jolly-up, will be held
om 7 o'clock to 9 in the Pavilion,
he dance was announced yester
ay with a twenty-five cent admit
mce charge. Leaders of Labor Day,
owever, have felt that the jolly-up
lould be given in partial thanks to
ic students for their support
iroughout the Convalescent Home
ppeal. Therefore, the price has
een slashed to ten cents a per
m, which will barely cover the ex
onses of the evening.
Craig's Cardinals, a nine-piece or

>r the dance. Contributions of food
ave been made by the Peninsula
reamery, Nipa Hut, Palm Hut, the
