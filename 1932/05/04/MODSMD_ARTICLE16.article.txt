# Visitor Praises Methods At Convalescent Home
## 
### 
Stanford's Convalescent Home, al- 1
' ready considered one of the' out
| standing institutions of its kind in
■ the West, will be the model after
which Switzerland will establish its
homes for convalescent children. 1
This was the enthusiastic com
ment given by Miss Alice Weber of
the Children's Clinic of Vienna, who
I visited the campus yesterday. A
I native of Switzerland, Miss Weber
I is visiting the United States under ,
the auspices of the Rockefeller In- ,
I stitute, and has allowed the Insti-
I tute to prepare her complete itincr-
I ary. It is no mean complimcnt to
I the Convalescent Home that it was
j listed as one of the few organiza
tions in California, and practically
| the only one of its type, to be in
cluded.
Miss Weber, who has been a stu
dent under Hamburger at Vienna,
| is interested primarily in cmpha-
I sizing the treatment of mentally de
i fective children. She explained that
at the Stanford home such treat

mentis given almost automatically
to the young patients, for anything
thai removes them from the dead
ening influence of hospitals or from
either the negligent or the pamper
ing care of their mothers, can be
considered a psychological im
provement.
In Vienna and other leading Eu
i ropean centers of medicine, a defi
nite trend is being noted toward the
treatment of children showing what
j may develop into criminal charac
teristics. It would be a wise eco
nomic investment, Miss Weber be
lieves, if America would follow in
this course; if out of every ten
children treated only two or three
respond, the result would still be an
. economic and sociological gain to
the country.
The one fault that she pointed out
i in children's institutions in America
! is Ihcil the typically European disci
pline is not only minimized, a defi
j nite improvement, but is almost to
j tally forgotten -probably a serious
| mistake.
