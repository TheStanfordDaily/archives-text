# A.S.S.U. VOTES TO RETAIN '33 MUSIC SERIES
## Ullmann Declares Budget Can Be Worked Out On Sound Basis FOUR CONCERTS ONLY Swain Suggests Palo Alto Committee To Handle Off-Campus Sale 
### 
An overwhelming majority vote
was polled yesterday in the special
A.S.S.U. Concert Series election,
with a total of 646 ballots cast for
retention of the series and only 41
against it.
After battling over the series all
year, the A.S.S.U. Ex Committee
recently decided to submit to the
student body the matter of con
tinuing or discarding the annual
music feature. Proponents of the
continuation plan, led by Miss Helen
Ullmann, present Concert Series
manager, declared that a budget
could be worked out which would
provide for a financially justifiable
series next year, despite a loss of
over $1,000 for this year's series.
Palo Alto Can Help
At the suggestion of Dr. Robert
E. Swain, acting University presi
dent, a committee of influential Palo
Alto citizens has been approached
regarding the handling of all Palo
Alto ticket sales. Miss Ullmann last
night declared that this plan should
result in greatly increased off-cam
pus sales, and at the same time
leave the Stanford management
more free to intensify its efforts on
the campus.
A group of four outstanding con
certs has been tentatively outlined
for next year, in place of the cus
tomary five. In connection with the
partial re-organization of the series
direction, a small committee has
been planned, to be composed of
Palo Alto residents and faculty
members, who will constitute a per
manent advisory board. A new
concert manager is appointed each
year, and, without any permanent
organization, the resulting constant
changes in management have, it is
declared, rendered the handling of
the concerts less efficient than will
be the case under the new plan.
Next Manager Named
Series managers for next year
were selected last night by the Ex
Committee, and their names will be
found in today's article on the Ex
Committee meeting.
Ray L. Wilbur, Jr., Election Board
