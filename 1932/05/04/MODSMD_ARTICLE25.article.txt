From tlie log-sawing of Herculean football 111011 lo doll
dressing by Ihe most petite of Stanford women there will
be work for everyone at the Convalescent Home this after
noon.
Coming but once a year, this paltry half day of labor
offers students their one opportunity to expend a bit of
lime and a bit of perspiration for a bunch of crippled kids.
Today, as always, there will be a few students who think
il quite the clever thing to ignore the appeal, and spend the
afternoon following their own interests with an "Oh, why
bother, I have lo study." Hut perhaps it is better that these
do not put their hands to the axe, shovel, or spade, lest they
be blistered for a day or so. Obviously il is ridiculous lo
add blistered hands to the combined ailments of mankind
when there is already enough suffering among the young
sters with twisted limbs who keep warm by the tires that
burn student-cut wood.
Hut the majority will be glad for tlie chance to help,
sorry that they can do no more. And after all, the "labor"
isn't particularly strenuous, nor is i! unmixed with a cer
tain amount of fun.
A little sawing, digging, or window washing, perhaps,
then a free barbecued dinner and an outdoor stage pro
gram that is always more humorous than intended—alto
gether a happy combination of work and play.
