# A 						VICTORY
## 
### 
Six hundred and forty-six students signified their desire
at the polls yesterday to have the Concert Scries main
tained. Forty-one were opposed.
Thus about 20 per cent of the student body expressed
its willingness to risk a part of the A.S.S.I', funds lo support
Stanford's one cultural advantage in the event of the Series
showing a dclicit. This figure cannot be taken at its face
value, however, for most of those students who were in
different to the continuance of the concerts did not vote
.-it all.
Nevertheless, (his is a real victory for the Series. Now
that the A.S.S.I*. has officially gone on record as favoring
the concert- even at the expense of the student funds, the
Series is much more secure and will no longer have to run
on a haphazard, hit-and-miss, year-to-year method.
Il is a shame that the vote was not larger, that a more
representative opinion of the campus could be gained.
Ilere was a problem that vitally concerned every member
of the student body, if not from a cultural, at least from a
financial standpoint. Yet only about one-fifth of the slu
clt'll Is considered it important enough lo spend a few min
utes of their time to express their wishes.
If student franchise was denied oil such matters, the
screams would be loud and long. Now that tlicy are per
mitted lo decide their own problems for themselves, few
students lake the trouble to participate.
