# HONOLULU HYSTERIA

### 
One of the most regrettable aspects of the Massic attack
case, which is, of course, regrettable in all its ramifications,
is the wildly hysterical attitude taken by almost everyone
who has been in any way connected with it. Not only sob
sisters, navy maniacs, and embattled defenders of the
nordic supremacy, but even experienced public leaders
have lost their heads over the affair.
The latest outburst was provoked bv the conviction of
the four slavers of Kahahawai, majority opinion condemn
ing the court for failing to acquit on the basis of the "un
written law." The facts that tin* defendants were unques
tionably guilty and that courts of law, whether in Hawaii
or on the mainland, are instituted to enforce the law ap
peal 1 to have been completely overlooked. An acquittal of
the while defendants would undoubtedly have been in
terpreted by the oriental population of the islands as race
discrimination, with resulting lack of respect for the law.
Mainland writers have been excitedly running the ga
mut of wild proposals for dealing with island conditions,
ranging as far as complete militarization and abolition of
the territorial government. Consequently, it is not espe
cially surprising, although saddening, to see supposedly
staid congressmen and senators rushing around with bills
providing immediate Federal pardons for Massie, Mrs.
Forlcscuc, .lones and Lord. Aside from the fact that con
gressmen in Washington can know very little of the true
situation, thinking people should be decidedly amused to
see representatives of the gang-ridden mainland drafting
special measures to curb crime in far-off Hawaii. Steps to
prevent the gangsters of Chicago and New ork from
escaping prison on technicalities would be much more to
the point.
All in all, it is a disgraceful episode and one that does
not reflect credit upon either the islands or the mainland.
