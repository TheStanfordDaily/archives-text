# BULL SESSION

One of the most persistently an
noying platitudes current in aca
demic circles is that politics could
be scourged, scoured, and reborn on
a newer and finer plane by college
students. From the slimy grip of
vice and corruption would Sir Gala
had. with his "A.8." banner waving
in the cool breeze, rescue politics
from its corruptors. In reality, it
were best to expect nothing in this
realm from college graduates. Then,
the disappointment would be made
less disturbing.
The "masses"—so named by col
legians—may be dumb; but they
try. That is why democracy has
been able to exist at all—beaten by
intellectuals from without—and torn
by inefficiency from within. But
college students know relatively
little about politics, and are proud
of their ignorance. With a puff of a
fag—a superior cackle—and a
sophisticated arch of the eyebrows,
the whole realm of actual politics
is tossed off with consummate ease.
While we college students may
not believe that the "Polish Cor
ridor" is a rear hallway in a cheap
Eastside hotel, we are sure that the
best "keynoters" in the land in
either party are Anson Weeks and

MOCK CONVENTIONS FOR STANFORD

I Guy Lombardo.
Along with the Olympics in 1932,
1 there will be a national election. It
'is a good thing fox - the latter that it
follows the former by some months
:or collegiatedom would think
Hoover was running in the "four
lap event." One can almost hear the
I sports scribes talking about "Hefty
Herb" trying to repeat his 1928 per
formance when he won hands down
from "Speedball Smith" —the cigar
puffing flash from the Big City.
To awaken some intelligent inter
j est in the election that will soon
show itself, it would be very en
joyable and instructive to have
mock conventions on thl> campus.
By going through the more obvious
gestures adhering to these nomi
nating conclaves, some tangible en
thusiasm for politics might be in
jected into the sophisticated colle
giate carcass. It is relatively easy to
yawn at the whole thing as "simple"
i and "boring." But if this superficial
layer of mud that we have smeared
I over our enthusiasm can be pried,
baked, or washed off—if we can
. enter into the spirit of the thing—
mock Republican and Democratic
' conventions sometime this quarter
would be a success.
