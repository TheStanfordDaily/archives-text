LA WALLY—At the Curran.
Thursday night marked the open
ing of the annual spring season of
the Pacific Opera Company and the
San Francisco premiere of Catalani's
"La Wally," a favorite Italian opera.
The story of "La Wally" is rather
involved and none too good. It is
laid in the Tyrolean Alps and con
cerns the lives and passions of or
dinary peasant types. Unfortunately
the opera is unrelieved by anything
approaching good staging or acting.
The music, however, is full of
color and on the whole the troupe
does very well with it. Iva Vanni
as La Wally does particularly well
as do the two young men, Henry
Thompson and, Matteo Dragoni.
Vanni's arias are often extremely
beautiful but her rather unfortunate
looks detract somewhat from her
character. The orchestra is perhaps
the star of the piece, playing the
melodious airs with great under
standing.
The troupe continues the week
with better-known operas which
should draw larger crowds than the
mere handful that heard "La
Wally." "Madame Butterfly" will be
presented tonight, "Cavalleria Rus
ticana" Thursday, "Traviata" Fri
day, and "Madame Butterfly" and
"La Wally" will be repeated at
matinee and evening performances
Saturday.
THE COPPERHEAD—At the Geary.
Lan Keith portrays an historical
character known in the play as Milt
Shanks who was one of the great
silent heroes of the War of the Se
cession. The story deals with the
necessary silence imposed upon
him, its tragic consequences to him,
his family, and his former friends
in the community. This early Amer
ican patriotism furnishes a rich
theme for Augustus Thomas' play,
"The Copperhead."
Such a role as that of Milt Shanks
has long been the ambition of lan
Keith and it can well be said that
he has made the most of his oppor
tunity to present this character.
The play is divided into two parts:
the first occurs in 1863; the second,
an epilogue which explains the in
tervening years, is set in 1911.
The drama is well done and its
appeal is genuine. This must be
true, because the audience actually
waited for a series of curtain calls.

REUNION IN VIENNA—By Rob
ert E. Sherwood. Scribner's. 1!C12.
After a slow first act during which
the less interesting aspects of ab
normal psychology are discussed,
Rudolf Hapsburg appears in the
manner of the Douglas Fairbanks

!of several years ago and, going
I through a series of ridiculous an
| tics, woos and wins a former mis
' tress, now turned wife, and dashes
| off again as quickly as he has come.
"Reunion in Vienna" ranks with
! Sherwood's "Road to Rome." Al
though less consistently amusing it
'is probably more conducive to
i amused writhing because of cer
i tain keen insei'tions of slapstick.
Aside from a not too strong satire
at the expense of psychiatry and the
various pathologies the play is good.
; sharp comedy which never for a
j moment lapses into sentimentality.
| Considering "Private Lives" as the
j outstanding example of pure high
j comedy in recent years, this play is
less consistently brilliant, but rises
I momentarily to that level and, after
i the first act, amuses.
There is a host of minor charac
j ters, decayed aristocrats now turned
'tutors, guides, taxi-drivers, and
j bookkeepers. Th«y offered much
' opportunity for messy sentimental
: ity, but Sherwood restrained him
j self, drew them comically, amused
I even at their own state. This move
was in the best of taste for a senti-
Imentalized rendering of the second

act banquet would have been in
sufficient where it is not very amus
ing.
The play demands exquisite play
ing. It is to be hoped that the Lunts
will forego New York long enough
to bring it here. —J.S.S.
PROBATION—At the New Mcnlo
Theatre.
This starts out. in a mundane way
in a drawing room of the inevitable
society mansion. The plot at first is
jumbled, but it soon resolves itself
into the old three-cornered triangle
with maybe a fourth "little sister"
playing in at times. On the whole,
Sally Blaine gives a loveable in
terpretation of a society girl but
we don't like the way John Darrow
holds his upper lip. Good story to it,
though. —J.H.G.

"To boo is taboo" is the slogar
of Minnesota coaches in regard tc
sportsmanship.

LA WALLY—At the Curran.
Thursday night marked the open
ing of the annual spring season of
the Pacific Opera Company and the
San Francisco premiere of Catalani's
"La Wally," a favorite Italian opera.
The story of "La Wally" is rather
involved and none too good. It is
laid in the Tyrolean Alps and con
cerns the lives and passions of or
dinary peasant types. Unfortunately
the opera is unrelieved by anything
approaching good staging or acting.
The music, however, is full of
color and on the whole the troupe
does very well with it. Iva Vanni
as La Wally does particularly well
as do the two young men, Henry
Thompson and, Matteo Dragoni.
Vanni's arias are often extremely
beautiful but her rather unfortunate
looks detract somewhat from her
character. The orchestra is perhaps
the star of the piece, playing the
melodious airs with great under
standing.
The troupe continues the week
with better-known operas which
should draw larger crowds than the
mere handful that heard "La
Wally." "Madame Butterfly" will be
presented tonight, "Cavalleria Rus
ticana" Thursday, "Traviata" Fri
day, and "Madame Butterfly" and
"La Wally" will be repeated at
matinee and evening performances
Saturday.
THE COPPERHEAD—At the Geary.
Lan Keith portrays an historical
character known in the play as Milt
Shanks who was one of the great
silent heroes of the War of the Se
cession. The story deals with the
necessary silence imposed upon
him, its tragic consequences to him,
his family, and his former friends
in the community. This early Amer
ican patriotism furnishes a rich
theme for Augustus Thomas' play,
"The Copperhead."
Such a role as that of Milt Shanks
has long been the ambition of lan
Keith and it can well be said that
he has made the most of his oppor
tunity to present this character.
The play is divided into two parts:
the first occurs in 1863; the second,
an epilogue which explains the in
tervening years, is set in 1911.
The drama is well done and its
appeal is genuine. This must be
true, because the audience actually
waited for a series of curtain calls.

Aside from a not too strong satire
at the expense of psychiatry and the
various pathologies the play is good.
; sharp comedy which never for a
j moment lapses into sentimentality.
| Considering "Private Lives" as the
j outstanding example of pure high
j comedy in recent years, this play is
less consistently brilliant, but rises
I momentarily to that level and, after
i the first act, amuses.
There is a host of minor charac

I even at their own state. This move
was in the best of taste for a senti-
Imentalized rendering of the second

act banquet would have been in

PROBATION—At the New Mcnlo

This starts out. in a mundane way
in a drawing room of the inevitable
society mansion. The plot at first is
jumbled, but it soon resolves itself
into the old three-cornered triangle
with maybe a fourth "little sister"
playing in at times. On the whole,
Sally Blaine gives a loveable in
terpretation of a society girl but
we don't like the way John Darrow
holds his upper lip. Good story to it,
though. —J.H.G.
