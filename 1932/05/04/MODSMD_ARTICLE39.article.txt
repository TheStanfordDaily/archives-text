THE PUBLICITY department of
he West Coast Relays, to be held
t Fresno on May 15, would like to
rrange a special half-mile event
or Ben Eastman and Eddie Gell
ing, Washington two-lapper. Ei.st
nan would run for a new world's
ecord, and Genung would go along
;jr ihe trip.
It would be a splendid proposi
ion for the relays, as it would
ause the turnstiles to play a merry
une, and it wouldn't be so bad
:om Eastman's point of view, since
would give him a chance to lower
is own time under almost ideal
ondilions. The Fresno track is very
ist, and the weather is usually
erfect for running in the evening.
Bill Ellington says "Nix," how
ver, pointing out that Ben has his
/oik eut out for him the following
/eek, when the California Inter
ollegiates will be held at Berkeley,
dustman will enter the mile relay
nd possibly one other relay event.
R-R-REVENGE ON those
Terrible Trojan fellers may he
forthcoming in the I.C.A.A.A.A.
meet at Berkeley in July.
Twenty-one to 2'.', points loom
for Stanford in the weights,
which with Eastman's 10 points
will form the foundation of
what may easily he a winning
score.
Troy undoubtedly has the
strongest dual meet learn in the
country, hut is not so well fixed
for a meet like the I.C.T-A.,
where outstanding first-place
winners rather than balanced
strength are what count.
On the other hand, with Stan
ford's great array of weight
men, Eastman in the 441) and
KM), Ray in the javelin, and a
few other possible points, the
meet is made to order for the
Indians.
The events in which U.S.C.
scored so heavily on Stanford
last Saturday, with the excep
tion of the hurdles, will be
heavily cut into by other teams x
while Stanford's strength in the
events above mentioned above
will he hurt very little.
SOME PEOPLE never can learn
> like artichokes no matter how
ard they try. It seems to be that
ay with Bob Kiesel, the Univer
ty of California's sensational
>phomore sprinter. Even people ;
ho say they don't dislike the taste ■
' artichokes declare they require i
>o much work for too little return. '
Surely Kiesel must get some
irill out of winning races. He j
ouldn't be human if ho didn't. Bui j
e has declared that he will not i
lake a bid for Olympic Games j
mors because lie dislikes the." j
aining grind.
"I just cannot get through all the j
ials," he told the management of j
le Olympic Games yesterday. "You j
now I never liked track and do
ot like it now. I am going to quit ]
i soon as I can, and no one will !
•t me back in it again."
. . .
HOW DIFFERENT it is with
Ben Eastman. He gets the same
kick out of running that others
do out of baseball, tag football,
or ping pong. Training seems to 1
he no effort for him.
And how different is Kiesel's
attitude from that of Frank
Fullenwider, just for instance.
Fullenwider is one of many who
have put in long, gruelling
hours on the track in prepara
tion for races in which he had
no possible chance of gelling
better than a second or third,
if that much. —L.M.C. |

"I just cannot get through all the j

now I never liked track and do

. . .
HOW DIFFERENT it is with
Ben Eastman. He gets the same
kick out of running that others
do out of baseball, tag football,
or ping pong. Training seems to 1
he no effort for him.
And how different is Kiesel's
attitude from that of Frank
Fullenwider, just for instance.
Fullenwider is one of many who
have put in long, gruelling
hours on the track in prepara
tion for races in which he had
no possible chance of gelling
better than a second or third,
if that much. —L.M.C. |
THE PUBLICITY department of
he West Coast Relays, to be held
t Fresno on May 15, would like to
rrange a special half-mile event
or Ben Eastman and Eddie Gell
ing, Washington two-lapper. Ei.st
nan would run for a new world's
ecord, and Genung would go along
;jr ihe trip.
It would be a splendid proposi
ion for the relays, as it would
ause the turnstiles to play a merry
une, and it wouldn't be so bad
:om Eastman's point of view, since
would give him a chance to lower
is own time under almost ideal
ondilions. The Fresno track is very
ist, and the weather is usually
erfect for running in the evening.
Bill Ellington says "Nix," how
ver, pointing out that Ben has his
/oik eut out for him the following
/eek, when the California Inter
ollegiates will be held at Berkeley,
dustman will enter the mile relay
nd possibly one other relay event.
R-R-REVENGE ON those
Terrible Trojan fellers may he
forthcoming in the I.C.A.A.A.A.
meet at Berkeley in July.
Twenty-one to 2'.', points loom
for Stanford in the weights,
which with Eastman's 10 points
will form the foundation of
what may easily he a winning
score.
Troy undoubtedly has the
strongest dual meet learn in the
country, hut is not so well fixed
for a meet like the I.C.T-A.,
where outstanding first-place
winners rather than balanced
strength are what count.
On the other hand, with Stan
ford's great array of weight
men, Eastman in the 441) and
KM), Ray in the javelin, and a
few other possible points, the
meet is made to order for the
Indians.
The events in which U.S.C.
scored so heavily on Stanford
last Saturday, with the excep
tion of the hurdles, will be
heavily cut into by other teams x
while Stanford's strength in the
events above mentioned above
will he hurt very little.
