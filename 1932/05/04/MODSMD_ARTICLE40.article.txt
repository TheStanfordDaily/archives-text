Hoerner Blows Up

was three down with four holes to |
go, but the match wasn't over.

to that extra hole, the par live j
number one, 490 yards in length, j
Hoerner's drive went down ihe j
fairway about 300 yards and then !
came the iron shot which almost j

on this same hole.
Hoag Defeats Kendall

the 18th coming up, but he three- [
putted the green and Hoag won the [
hole to force the match to an extra j
hole.
Again on the 19th, Kendall had l
the advantage as he sent his sec
ond shot to the far edge of the
green, while Hoag's lay in a trap.
