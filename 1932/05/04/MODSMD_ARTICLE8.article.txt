ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., May 3. I/I'|
â€”A "more vigorous" continuance of
national prohibition and an immedi
ate reconstruction of existing rela
tions between industry and the
worker were called for today by the
Board of Bishops of the Methodist
Episcopal Church in an Episcopal
letter to the General Conference.
Substitutes and modification plans
for the Eighteenth Amendment were
waived aside in the message.
As a rally cry against state liquor
control, the following slogan was put
forward: "We can no more have a
nation half drunk and half sober
than in the days of Lincoln it was
possible to have a nation half slave
and half free."
