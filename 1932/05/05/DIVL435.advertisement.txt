advertised products

Wheeling Steel Corporation-lf advertising
as a business tool is only to be used where
business has earned a substantial surpius
over expense, advertising is on shaky legs.
If we consider advertising in its proper rela
tion to distribution of products we cannot
justify the conclusion that its functions be
limited to periods of prosperity. Too much
depends upon public favor and distributor
co-operation which are the results of adver
tising and are essential to business growth.
When the profit flow becomes a little more
than a dribble we'd better look for a new
basis for budgets.
J. B. Williams Company-We believe that a
company's advertising should be absolutely
continuous and that the volume of advertis
ing should be as even as the products and
the condition of the market will justify.
