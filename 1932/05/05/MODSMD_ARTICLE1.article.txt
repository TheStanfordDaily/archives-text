## Chi Psi's Lead Fraternities; Sorority List Headed by Kappa Kappa Gamma; Dormitories Topped By Sequoia, and Clubs by Encina LABOR DAY NETS TOTAL OF $150 FOR FUND 1931 Total Exceeded by Efforts of Karl and Assistants, Student Co-operative Effort Shown 
### 
I ESS than $105 is needed for Stanford's 19152 Convalescent Home Appeal

workers, and last night the total lacked hut a few dollars of $2400.
But officially, the entire campus has responded iu a way hardly ex
pected by even the most optimistic. Due entirely to the ceaseless efforts
>8 Charles Karl and his assistants, and the whole-hearted co-operation of

n 1 {#21. Chi Psi, with an increased donation of $50, forged ahead of the
raternities, while Kappa Kappa Gamma still leads the sororities. Los
