# RIFLE TEAM LEAVES TODAY FOR TOURNEY AT SAN LUIS OBISPO
## 
### 
Planning to enter the state
Springfield 30 caliber matches at
San Luis Obispo over the week
end, members of the Stanford Rifio
team will leave for that city this
afternoon.
Bill Harding, John Adams, and
several others will make the trip,
and as the team is not officially a
member of the State Association,
they will pay their own entrance
fees and compete as unofficial mem
bers of the team.
Because of their exceptionally
successful practices held during the
past few weeks, the team is expect
ing to rate near the top when the
final results are turned in.
