# Chinese War Spreads To Convalescent Home
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Until yesterday it was only the
inmates of I lie Convalescent Homo :
who were convalescing — now it's
the Home itself.
Answering the call of Charity,
three hundred sons of the Stanford
Red, overflowing with five-thumbs
per-hand helpfulness, descended on
a defenseless Convalescent Home ;
early yesterday afternoon and pro- j
ceedcd to put the Home in shape I
for the coming year—but what kind j
of shape, only a war correspondent !
could describe.
Undaunted by the few sissy-kiss- 1
ers who insisted on making loads,
the majority decided to make i
merry. Evidently under the hallu- i
cination lhat they were Tarzans,
some spent the entire afternoon
climbing trees and emitting tri- j
umphant yells.
Overrun with an additional large
contingent of would-be workers at

meal-time, the place rapidly turned
into a shambles. Pick-axes were
taken from roadwork to perform
the more amusing duty of knocking
out teeth. Future shyster lawyers
gave up studying Biblical History
long enough to throw gravel
through eye-glasses, while the
mothers of the next generation
overturned tables of food. Tho scene
looked like a cross between the
hopeless cases ward of a lunatic
asylum and a kindergarten for !
backward infants.
The Convalescent Home now j
knows how Shanghai felt after the i
Japanese troops finished persuad-j
ing the Chinese to buy Japanese
goods. It is rumored that a movie i
company his offered a large sum !
for the right to shoot the film ver
sion of the Battle of the Maine on '
the grounds of the Convalescent I
Home.
A good time was had by all.
