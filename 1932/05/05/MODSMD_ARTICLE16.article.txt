# Les
						Hables Leaves Stanford as Sinus Breaks Resistance
## Sprinter Out For Season; Fresno Relay Chances May Be Badly Damaged; Aspirations For Olympics Hinge On Summer Developments 
### DICK STROUSE 
! holding out for five months against the combined forces of sick- ,
I ness, injury, and tapeworm, Les Hables, ex-sprinter supreme of the
j varsity track squad, finally was forced to surrender yesterday when he
took out a leave of absence from Stanford. Iluhlcs bad shown much in
testinal fortitude of both, a literal and figurative kind throughout the
I siege, but his supply of vitamins or whatever a man uses to oppose the
attack of sinus finally gave out, and the little dash-man will not run
for the Farm again this year. Hables will be missed in all the remaining
meets, beginning with the Fresno Relays on May 14. llis leave, coining

after a similar one by Frank j
Lombardi, breaks up what prom
ised at the beginning of this year '
to be the greatest half-mile relay
team ever to represent Stanfoi'd.
Ben and Gibey Left
Hables, Lombardi, Eastman, and
i Giberson—that combination of 220- >
[j men might have put even the hand- i
j some Trojan in his place. As it is,

i even if Eastman and Giberson each J
j run twice, the half-mile team at'
; Fresno can hardly be expected to
! win.
He may try for a place on the j
United States Olympic team later
in the summer if he can fight off j
appendicitis, tapeworm, a burned |
foot, a few pulled muscles, his sinus j
I trouble, and whatever else medicine ;
has in store for him by then.
Fresno Next
i The Stanford Indian's next stop
will be Fresno, and it will take him !
until a week from Saturday to get j
there. He will meet the greatest j
