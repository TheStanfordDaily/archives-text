# MORE POLLING PLACES
## 
### 
Today's Campus Opinion column carries a surest ion
for obtaining a more representative vote at elections by
establishing more polling places, located at convenient
points around the Quad. The letter writer believes that a
large proportion of the students do not vole simply because
they do not happen to be near the polls when the urge to
cast a ballot strikes them.
There is much sound common sense in this proposal.
I'nless he has an unusual interest in the election, the aver
age denizen of the Farm will not walk across the Quad to
vole. Kven if he has a fairly definite opinion on the matter
in question he will not bestir himself sufticienlly to go out
of his way to express that opinion.
The only important objection to the plan for dividing
the polls is that it might facilitate stalling the ballot boxes.
Overly enthusiastic politicians could vote at each balloting
place. However, this danger could be easily avoided by
requiring pr scntation of student body cards, which could
be punched in a distinctive manner.
After Tuesday's example of apathy in regard to elec
tions, the need for some action to make expressions of stu
dent wishes more representative should be apparent. Any
reasonable suggestion such as this deserves a trial.
