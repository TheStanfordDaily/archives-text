of the 100 per cent Roman, Fabius
i Maximus, and foe of the unpatriotic
! and the impractical.
Gantner Is Fabius
The role of Fabius, dictator of
' Rome and husband of the heroine,
Amytis, will be read by Vallejo
i Gantner, weH-known campus actor.
| It will be interesting to see how he

I younger brother of Hannibal, and
; caretaker of the famous elephants,
! is to be read by Edward Girzi, who
j played the bored young Rene St.

ly, a romantic attempt to explain the
I mysterious action of Hannibal, com
! mander of the Carthaginian forces
I directed against Rome, when at the

• Monna Vanna."
