# CAPONE MISSED THIS RACKET

Al ('apone may have control of a goodly number of
rackets, hut lie seems to have overlooked one that would
undoubtedly add several hundred (i's to his bank roll. He
would have simply to write an autobiography under a
preface which explained that the volume was published I
for the sole purpose oY informing decent citizens of the cor
ruption that makes crime possible, in order that they might
know thoroughly what they are striving to eliminate.
Perhaps he thinks it too late to muscle in on news
papers, magazines, and publishers who have already or- '
ganized the hoax on a highly remunerative basis. Surely
he doesn't think that his inability to write disqualifies him.
That is, of course, if he has read any of the numerous ac- j
counts of his life which appear daily in serial form in news- !
papers throughout the country.
The latest Hay Hegion paper to capitalize on the "Ca
pone and Crime" racket is the San Francisco ('liroiiiclc, \
which began in its hist Sunday edition the story of Al (,a
ponc written by a Mr. Fred I). Pasley. This newspaper, of
course, is hardly aware that America's thirst for yarns
depicting the dashing, daring courage <>l men who thumb
noses at the law, approaches even its thirst for the liquid
that the activities of these men supply.
It is careful, perhaps a bit !<><> careful, to point out to I
leaders that the biography is printed in the cause of suf
fering humanity, printed solel\ to inform citizens of the
lamentable conditions which nurture crime in America.
Says the ('.hroiiiclr: " This is not merely the exposure
of an individual's misdeeds, hut rather of public apathy '
which has permitted gang rule to challenge civilization. 1
('apone is under Federal penitentiary sentence for income
tax evasion, but the conditions that made his career pos
sible still exist. (iang rule must be met and stamped out, (
and to be must be understood by decent peo
ple."
Ah, yes, of course.
