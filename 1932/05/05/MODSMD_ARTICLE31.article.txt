# BULL SESSION

### 
Pity the Democrats —they need
pity. It seems that they would
rather enjoy a good old fashioned
knock-down and drag-em-out street
fight than a Presidential victory.
This year, when the killing rays oi
the depression were slaying the
tank and file among the Repub
licans—the Democrats had a chance.
As the stock market fell, the Demo
crats rose. Even from the financial
ruins—did their strength rise. The
time came when for the first time
in sixteen years, conservative prog
nosticators gave them an even
chance to win.
But the Democrats have become
intoxicated with the fruits of vic
tory before tasting them. For once,
they were able to view the beauti
ful vale of success and the sight in
spired them with untold vigor. Yet
they have been spending all that
new-born vigor running around in
circles and clubbing each other
over the head. Meanwhile the cloud
of gloom that had been hanging
around the Republican camp like a
sticky wet blanket has suddenly
risen and is continuing its perpen
dicular excursion. Nightly, the big
moguls of the G.O.P. gather to
dance to the monotonous yet cheer
ful rhythm of Democratic clubs on
Democratic craniums.
The policy of self-extermination
has been merrily continued out here
on the coast. Garner received the
California delegation while Roose
velt and Smith beat each other into
an impotent pulp. The loss of these
delegates just means so much more
dissension for the Democrats in
Chicago this summer; just so much
more balm for the Republican soul;
and a whole handful of feathers in
the hat of W. R. Hearst. Hearst be
ing the gentleman who discovered
in Jack "Washington's-Best-Poker-
Player" Garner a thing by which he
could stop New York's brace of fa
vorite sons, Roosevelt and Smith.
There is only one man in this
country that Hearst hates more than
Volstead and that man is A1 Smith.
To* drub him the great publisher
would support anything or anybody;
and he almost did that here in
California. Secondly, if "Whiskey
William" had contented himself
with climbing on the Roosevelt Ex
press back in 1930, his inconspicu
osity would have been great. But
by making himself a leading bump
on the log lying on the tracks, he

PITY THE DEMOCRATS

I may he able to experience great j
! ego-maximalion should the Roose- ,
j velt Express be derailed.
Yet the Smasher of the Demo- i
i cratic Party No. 1 is Alfred E. j
| Smith. If he had pushed Roosevelt,
i all the Garners and Hearsts in the
l nation could not have stopped the j
New York governor from sweeping
! the Convention and riding on a I
| healthy mule in the race of Novem- I
ber. Victory was very possible. By
! fighting his former friend and ally, |
Ihe may be able to wreck both j
Roosevelt and himself. At any
event, whoever gets the Bourbon
! nomination will have to make the
1 race of one of the most battered
jackasses of history—one scarred,
| bruised, and suffering from the
j whole gamut of internal disorders.
Truly, the Washington Corres- j
' pondent who exclaimed that the ,
' Democrats were busy grasping de- j
j feat from the jaws of victory was !
i right! —Abe Mellinkoff
