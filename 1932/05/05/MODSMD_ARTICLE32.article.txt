[EARL CARROLL'S VANITIES — |
At the Columbia.

i musical review is this collection of i
I dances, ensembles, and skits "di- j

! the great Mister Carroll." Some of :
the sets are truly lovely and the j
: costumes are masterpieces in the j
! aesthetic sense, but hardly exam- j
! pies of what Mrs. Babbitt will wear j
I to tea.
The gem bits of the performance !
| were done by Herb Williams, whom 1
i we all know from movie shorts by j
] the bywords "Wise Guys!" and (
I "Conspiracy." His piano concert act j
! got more laughs than all the smutty j
cracks in the show put together.;
[ However, Herb shares the comedy j
I honors equally with that fire-and- :
I everything - else - eating comedian,
j Chas. Chase.
I And in a class by herself is Vivian
Fay, THE dancer of the show. Her
j poise and carefully trained tech- '
j nique are ably and charmingly dis
' played in the three flying pirouettes

I number.
Go to this show for entertainment j
I but don't expect to come out the

j elevation. —E.H.
