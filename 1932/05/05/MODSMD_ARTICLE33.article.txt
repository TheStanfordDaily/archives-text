# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is quite a common thing to
read in the Daily "600 voted at the j
election yesterday, and although,
the voting did not indicate the at- j
titude of the whole student body,
the overwhelming majority of 450
to 50 won for such and such an is
sue." Much has been written about
instituting vigorous political mea
sures into our elections, giving talks
in the Assembly Hall, and other
means of stirring interest in the is- !
sue. Nothing of this nature has been |
done, probably because the A.S.S.U. I
officers realize correctly that only
a very small number would re
spond desirably to such a program.
Most students are interested in
campus affairs. They will vote if
given the opportunity. However,
classroom worries bid them pass by
the poll at the law steps, and when
they have a bit of time, they are far,
far away from the region for mark
ing the ballot. May we say that stu
dents forget to return to the poll
and cast their votes, or perhaps the
Stanford rough engages his time be
tween classes in a tete-a-tete with
the apple of his eye?
May I suggest that in the future,
instead of one poll at the law steps,
we have several, distributed so that j
they wi]l be accessible to the larg- i
est number of students at any time j
of the day?
Thus instead of four persons at .
the one poll to distribute ballots, j
they could be scattered to the four
corners of the Quad to serve the
cord-clad engineer, the spat
adorned English major, the bespec
tacled physicist, and the sun-tanned j
fossil hunter. Then, perhaps, we
could have a representative elec
tion instead of the present meagre
twenty per cent vote.
