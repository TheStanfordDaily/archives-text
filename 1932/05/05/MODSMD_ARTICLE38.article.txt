LES HABLES takes it on the chin
.gain. Sinusitis, the latest ailment to
ti-.sail the hard-luck Indian sprinter,
.vill keep him out of competition
or the rest of the season. Hables
loctor yesterday ordered him to
ake out a leave of absence and
seek a warmer climate until his
>inus trouble clears up.
King City's fastest human was
ust getting in shape after a long
;tring of trouble which included an
ippendicitis operation, tape worm
emoval, burned foot, and what not,
vhen the sinusitis came along to
complicate matters. Hables had run
1.7 in the century in two early
season meets and appeared to be
•eady for a great year when his
;eagle began acting up.
The loss of Hables for the rest of
he season will rob Stanford ol
;everal expected points in the
.C.A.A.A.A. meet — points which
jtherwise may go to Southern Cali
ornia.
"I'd feel terrible," Les said yes
erday afternoon, "if we should lyse
he meet by just a couple of points,
jut orders are orders."
SPEAKING OF THE SPRINTS,
Frunkie WykofF announced yes
terday that he will not compete
in the 220-yard or 200-ineler
events any more this season.
The Trojan sprinter prefers to
concentrate on the 100-yard
dash in the remaining collegiate
events, and the 100-meter sprint
in the Olympics.
This will help Stanford's
chances in the 1.C.4-A. meet
unless he should change his
mind. If victory or defeat for
the Trojans seemed to hinge on
WykofT's running in the longer
sprint, it is quite possible that
he would enter it if his injured
hack would permit.
DOWN AT New Orleans there is
m Olympic Games sprint prospect
vho in many ways is like Bob Kie
el, the California runner who has
lecided that track is a lousy pas
irne. Emmett Toppino is his name.
Toppino is a natural runner who
vould rather play baseball than
nything else, but who was talked
nto a track career during his soph
more year at Loyola of the South,
n that ye:ir he ran the 100-yard
lash in 9.6 seconds, his best mark
intil last summer, when he tied the
fficial world's record with a 9.5
/inning performance in the Nation
-1 Collegiate meet at Lincoln, Ne
raska.
No less than six times has the
lew Orleans lad tied the world's
0-yard dash record of G. 2 seconds
i indoor meets. Recently in an un
fficially timed exhibition he also
qualed the 100-meter record of 10.4
econds.
Unlike Kiesel, however, whose
rst love is also baseball, Toppino
3 a candidate for the United States
•lympic Games team. At the pres
et time he is a graduate student at
ie Loyola School of Dentistry.
SOMEHOW IT'S hard to get
all steamed up over the forth
coming Sharkey-Schineling hat
tic to he held in New York next
month. Schmeling has been far
from a colorful champion, and
hardly a popular one.
As for Sharkey, he has been
too erratic, too undependahle to
excite much interest this time.
Few have seemed to doubt
Sharkey's ability to stop any of
the heavyweights the last few
years have produced, hut when
he gets in the ring, he leaves
the old head outside.
If Sharkey could put over a
decisive, clean win over Schmel
ing, it might do a great deal to
restore public faith in him
and interest in the heavyweight
division. —L.M.C.
