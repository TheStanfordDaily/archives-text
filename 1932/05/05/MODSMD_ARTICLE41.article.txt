League titles are at stake today as
the four hard ball teams of League
II battle in the deciding round of
mural play and the leaders of the
first division clash in the initial
championship round.
The battle between the Theta Chi
nine and the El Capitan ball club
will be the special card of the day.
Although the Club outfit rests at
the bottom of the League II ladder,
El Capitan may pull a surprise act
and defeat the league-leading Theta
Chi's. Should Theta Chi win, the
Row team will retain an undisputed
first place and will snatch the league
title.
Second Game
For the second League II game
of the day, S.A.E.'s play the Alpha
Sigs. At present both teams are in
a tie for second place. The winner
of today's fracas will be runner-up
in the division championship should
Theta Chi triumph.
A general league mix-up would
result if El Capitan should prove
victorious. The winners of the other
league game, either the S.A.E.'s or
the Alpha Delts, would claim a first
place tie with Theta Chi, and a
special championship game would
be in order.
Sigma Chi Fracas
The Sigma Chi fracas with the El
Toro club will add another spec
tacular card to the day's title races.
Should Sigma Chi defeat the nine
from the eating club, the Row out
fit will be a certain winner for the
League I championship. On the
other hand, should Toro triumph,
the Club men will move into a tie
for first place with the Sigma Chi
men.
The remainder of the final round
of hard ball season follows: BB in
dicates the ball diamonds, while FB
signifies one of the football fields.
