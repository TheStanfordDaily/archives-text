Unless some Afghan or Bolivian
'sprinter wilh undreamed-of speed J
j and stamina comes to the front, j
| candidates for the 200-meter Olym- |
j pic title will go to the post without
! an outstanding favorite.
i Dark horses dominated the sprints
j at Amsterdam in 1928, with two
; high-school boys, Frank WykofT for
j the United States and Percy Wil-
I Jiams of Canada, providing most of
I the speed in preliminary heats. Wy
j kofT cracked up in the final of the
! 100-metei", placing fourth, but Wil- j
liams went on to win both dashes :
in 10.8 and 21.8 seconds.
WykofT in 100-Meter
j WykofT will confine himself to the
■ 100-meter this year, but the Cana
| dian youth is out to repeat his 1928
j triumph. W. Rangley took second >
j in the.' longer sprint at Amsterdam, i
| but he has given up his position as
| England's ranking 200-meter run- 1
; ner in favor of J. T. Hanlon, who '•
I has done 21.4 seconds. The Olympic |
J record for the distance is 21.6 sec-
I onds.
j Helmut Kornig, third-place win
| ner at Amsterdam, holds the Euro
pean record at 21 seconds fiat, but
■ he seems to have lost a bit of his
| 1928 speed. Three other German
sprinters, Jonath (100-meter favor
ite), Eldracher, and Gillemeister,
have done 21.2 seconds.
South African Sprinters
J. A. Joubert and Harold Legg
of South Africa constitute a serious
threat to other sprint champions.
Legg placed fifth in the 100-meter
at Amsterdam, but four years of
competition seem to have taken
| their toil. A competitive athlete if
| there ever was one, the Maple Leaf
J champion, Percy Williams, cannot
j be counted out of the running until
I Ihe tape has been broken.
What will American sprinters do
against this formidable lineup?
"Bullet Bob" Kiesel is perhaps the
• fastest man in the world over 200
meters, but Kiesel doesn't care for |
competitive running. In 1928, "Bul
let Bob, then a sophomore at
j Tamalpais High, passed up a chance
to go to the Olympic tryouts in Bos
i ton, and only yesterday the greatest
Blue-and-Gold sprinter in history
announced that he didn't believe he
would try out for the team. Emmett
Toppino and Eddie Tolan have
"champion's hearts," and for that
j reason must be considered the best
American hopes to pit against the
field.
Record in Every Race
In 1930 George Simpson was
cracking records in every race for
Ohio State, and he may regain his
form. Another runner who has
j Slipped is Hec Dyer, Stanford's
j sprinter last year. Boyd Comstock,
I L.A.A.C. track coach, believes that
j Dyer will win Ihe Olympic 200-

meter title, and a report from Santa
Barbara credits "Hec" with times of
10.6 and 21.G for 100 and 200 meters.
Two Stanford undergraduates,
"Hard Luck" Abe Abies and A1
Blackman, freshman track captain,
have outside chances of making the
American team.
