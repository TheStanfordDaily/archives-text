# DE SOTO FACTORY MODEL SHOWN AT STANFORD TODAY
## Unique Exhibit At Engineer Corner To Be Led By Pete De Paolo 
### 
Tiny models of the 1932 De Soto
Six. two and a half inches long,
will be assembled in a miniature of
the De Soto factory at the Engi
neering corner at 3:30 o'clock today,
according to Professor Arthur B.
Domonoske, head of the mechani
cal engineering department.
Built to scale, ihe factory is 20
feet long and 4 feet wide. It cost
$20,000 to build and is an exact re
production of the large factory in
Detroit. Everything is on one floor
level as in the great plant.
When the toy plant is in opera
tion, assembly lines move along and
overhead conveyors bring the parts
to the proper places at just the
right time for assembly. Mechanical
"mules" speed along to carry out
waste matter.
Accompanying the model factory
is Peter de Paolo, famous racer, who
holds the 500-milc record at the
Indianapolis track. The racer will
explain the operation of the model
and answer all questions.
The visit to the Stanford campus
of De Paolo with the model is in the
course of a nation-wide tour. The
model came to the Bay region di
rectly from the New York Automo
bile Show.
Before and after it is shown on
the campus the model can be seen
