# HOOVER DEMANDS ACTION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 5. (/Pi—Ar
■ raigning the House of Representa
j tives in stinging terms, President
[ Hoover addressed to Congress late
i today a special message demanding
a "definite and conclusive program
I for balancing the budget."
j "It would go far to restore busi
j ness, employment, and agriculture
| alike," he declared, after decrying
| uncertainty as "disastrous."
The pronouncement, coming as it
I did when the Senate Finance Com
| mittee had just lifted income taxes
j to still higher levels and after an
impassioned speech by Senator
I Borah of Idaho on the need for
| drastic international action to com
bat disaster, climaxed a day fraught
j with evidence of the troubled times.
Bourbons Flay Speech
No sooner had the Senate listened
i to the message than the Democratic
leader, Robinson of Arkansas, rose
to blame "unaccountable errors" by
| the Administration in estimating
I the money needed to run the gov-
I ernment for the situation in which
Congress finds itself. In the House,
! Representative Rainey—leader for
the Democratic majority—termed
I the Hoover message "the first speech
| in his campaign for re-election."
The President asserted that in
spite of beneficial remedical mea
sures "and the gradual improve
ment in fundamental conditions, fear
I and alarm prevail because of events
j in Washington which have greatly
[ disturbed the public mind."
"Uncontrolled Inflation"
He proceeded to list House ac
| tions in rejecting the Treasury and
j Ways and Means Committee tax
programs, road building authoriza-
I tions, enlarging veterans' benefits,
"virtual destruction" of economy
programs, and "the threat of fur
] ther legislation looking to uncon
j trolled inflation."
These, he avowed, "have all re
' suited in diminishing public con
! fidence."
