# De Paolo to Stay Away From Indianapolis Race

### HARRY McMASTERS 
Am I going to enter the Indian
apolis race? Not this year. Maybe J
next. year. Got a good job now. I'm •
sure of eating."
So said Pete De Paolo, the racer,
despite the fact that he won $52,000
when he won the Indianapolis clas- '
sic in 192!), setting a record for the '
track which still stands, an average
of 101.13 miles per hour for the
500 miles.
"This is a bad time of year for j
me," De Paolo continued. "I'm just
itching to go to Indianapolis. The j
faster you go the faster you want j
to go. It's fascinating."
Five Crashes
"Thrills? The first six races I was ,
in I crashed five times. The last j
bad wreck I had was at Indian- I
apolis in 1028 during the qualify
ing trial. My steering gear broke i
going into a turn.
"I let go the wheel and grabbed
the bottom of my seat so my head j

just cleared the cowl. 1 slid l.) 0 leet. j
upside down with my nose about a I
quarter of an inch above the bricks. '
I was conscious the whole time. Oh I
boy, that was the greatest thrill 1 :
ever had. Finally I crashed against j
the wall and was thrown out. A
cracked elbow was all I got."

De Paolo is surprisingly slight for I
a man who has piloted great cars 1
to victory. He stands about 5 feet j
7 inches tall. He entered racing, he j
said, through his uncle, Ralph De
Palma, for whom he was mechanic j
for three years.
Besides winning the Indianapolis
race in 1925, De Paolo won the
A.A,A. trophy in 1925 and 1927 for
having made the greatest number
of points in races during the season. I
In 1925 he raced on the Monza
speedway just out of Milan. Italy,
and was decorated by Mussolini as
Knight of Speed.
