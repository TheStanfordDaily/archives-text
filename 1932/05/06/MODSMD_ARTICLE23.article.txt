# DRAMATIC READING SCORES HIT
## 
### 
Aii audience which filled 1 bc>
| Little Theatre applauded generously
| last night in commendation of the ,
"Road to Rome," second of a series
I of readings sponsored by Sword and
I Sandals, men's honorary dramatic i
fraternity.
Of the cast, Dorothy Tully was
outstanding. Her Amytis was thrill—
ingly real. In the first stellar rule
slip has had at Stanford Dorothy
succeedcd extremely well. The role
was difficult, demanded rapid
i changes from light comedy to more
j serious drama. It is true praise to
I .say that these changes were man
| aged successfully and, at times —
' most notably the end of the second
act-- brilliantly.
Vallejo Gantner's Fabius wa.i
I played broadly but amusingly,
! Gantner proving that he may be at
j least moderately unromantic on a j
stage. As Hannibal, William Lyons
| acquitted himself well, although not
J startlingly.
Virginia Ingrim made Fabia cor
rectly acid, and in minor roles Jo
soph Wolf, Jack Jago, Arthur Hurt,
Jane Desenberg, and Joel Egerer,
were satisfactory. ]
