# Coach Calls Off Big Ben-Genung Hall-Mile Duel
## Ellington to Let Star Run Only One Race at Fresno Relays; Nash, Fullenwider, Giberson to Fight It Out for Places on Relay Team 
### DICK STROUSE 
I) ILL ELLINGTON, present big shot of the Stanford track forces, lias
decided that Ibis collegiate Farm has a one-mile relay team. Top-man
William has also decided, with some invaluable assistance from A1 Masters,
that the ex-home of- President Hoover has no other relay team (or teams)
to enter in the baton festival at Fresno a week from Saturday, so Elling
ton will follow the course of least resistance and most strength and con
centrate the Indian power in the four-lap race on May 14. Because of
the California Intercollegiates, in which Stanford will face its beloved
Trojan cousin and incidentally the Bear from Berkeley and the Bruin
from Wcstwood on the twenty-first, Ellington and Tcmpleton ill not let
any of their stars run more than one race at Fresno. Thus a possible

"strong distance relay team with
Nash and Ike Hables running quar
ter-miles, Ben Eastman trotting a
half-mile, and Jim Ferrie negoti
! ating the full-mile distance will not
I
materialize.
Eastman—the news of the varsity
track squad—will take the after
-1 noon off at Fresno as he will prob
ably only appear as anchor man of
the mile relay team. This is a dis
tinct blow to the publicity depart
! ment of the relay meet, and will
turn many cash customers away
, from the gates. However, Ihe Blazer
i may condescend to run his 440 in
43 or 44 seconds so that those who
pay to see Eastman will be able to
flivver back to lowa boasting they
, have seen Eastman.
Lucky Genung
The big match race between Ed
| die Genung of Washington and
' Eastman—a member of the Stanford
' track squad—in which Ben was to
: have broken the world's half-mile
record by a few more seconds, will
i not, according to present indica
: tions, be held. Although Templeton
i has sanctioned the idea, Eastman
! is not particularly enthused about it
and Ellington and Masters have op
posed it.
This is the best news that Mr.
Genung, himself a runner of some
i note in a nnlional way, has heard
since he learned that Eastman did
: not break the world's 880 mark by
i more than a second. For it would
i not be at all correct for a champion
to be beaten by a super-champion
i by a lap or so, which is what would
i happen if Genung, or anyone else,
| met Eastman.
Four Out of Five
Five men are possibilities for
places on the mile team that will
try and uphold Stanford's tradition
1 as a producer of world's champions
i in the mile relay, but which four
j out of the five will have it? It is
j not probable that anyone at Stan
i ford can take Eastman's berth away
from him, and Captain Alvin Ha
bles also seems to be a sure starter.
Nash, Fullenwider, and Giberson
will light it out for the other two
positions, with the first men, who
t helped Eastman and Hables beat
Troy's quartet, having the edge.
Ellington still has hopes of get-
It ing together a medley team. He
| figures that with Ferrie in the mile,
jhe can find a couple of quarter
-1 milers and an 880 mail from among
I Giberson, Naylon, Storms, and At
| kinson.

Lucky Genung
The big match race between Ed
| die Genung of Washington and
' Eastman—a member of the Stanford
' track squad—in which Ben was to
: have broken the world's half-mile
record by a few more seconds, will
i not, according to present indica
: tions, be held. Although Templeton
i has sanctioned the idea, Eastman
! is not particularly enthused about it
and Ellington and Masters have op
posed it.
This is the best news that Mr.
Genung, himself a runner of some
i note in a nnlional way, has heard
since he learned that Eastman did
: not break the world's 880 mark by
i more than a second. For it would
i not be at all correct for a champion
to be beaten by a super-champion
i by a lap or so, which is what would
i happen if Genung, or anyone else,
| met Eastman.
Four Out of Five
Five men are possibilities for
places on the mile team that will
try and uphold Stanford's tradition
1 as a producer of world's champions
i in the mile relay, but which four
j out of the five will have it? It is
j not probable that anyone at Stan
i ford can take Eastman's berth away
from him, and Captain Alvin Ha
bles also seems to be a sure starter.
Nash, Fullenwider, and Giberson
will light it out for the other two
positions, with the first men, who
t helped Eastman and Hables beat
Troy's quartet, having the edge.
Ellington still has hopes of get-
It ing together a medley team. He
| figures that with Ferrie in the mile,
jhe can find a couple of quarter
-1 milers and an 880 mail from among
I Giberson, Naylon, Storms, and At
| kinson.
I) ILL ELLINGTON, present big shot of the Stanford track forces, lias
decided that Ibis collegiate Farm has a one-mile relay team. Top-man
William has also decided, with some invaluable assistance from A1 Masters,
that the ex-home of- President Hoover has no other relay team (or teams)
to enter in the baton festival at Fresno a week from Saturday, so Elling
ton will follow the course of least resistance and most strength and con
centrate the Indian power in the four-lap race on May 14. Because of
the California Intercollegiates, in which Stanford will face its beloved
Trojan cousin and incidentally the Bear from Berkeley and the Bruin
from Wcstwood on the twenty-first, Ellington and Tcmpleton ill not let
any of their stars run more than one race at Fresno. Thus a possible

"strong distance relay team with
Nash and Ike Hables running quar
ter-miles, Ben Eastman trotting a
half-mile, and Jim Ferrie negoti
! ating the full-mile distance will not
I
materialize.
Eastman—the news of the varsity
track squad—will take the after
-1 noon off at Fresno as he will prob
ably only appear as anchor man of
the mile relay team. This is a dis
tinct blow to the publicity depart
! ment of the relay meet, and will
turn many cash customers away
, from the gates. However, Ihe Blazer
i may condescend to run his 440 in
43 or 44 seconds so that those who
pay to see Eastman will be able to
flivver back to lowa boasting they
