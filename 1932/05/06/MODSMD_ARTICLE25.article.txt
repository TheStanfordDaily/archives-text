# Pigs Fed Wine In Hungary But People Go Penniless
## 
### 
BUDAPEST, May 5. (IP)â€”Nothing
I speaks more eloquently of the hard
I fate that has this year befallen ihe
Hungarian wine industry than the
j fact that in several parts of the
| country pigs are being fed on wine
I of good quality. It is reported that
I this improves the appetite of pigs
and the vineyard owners prefer to
give their stocks of wine to the
porkers rather than sell it at the
' ridiculous price of three-fourth cent
! a liter.
