# A 						PLEA RENEWED
## 
### 
Once cit>ain Hit' campus intellectuals who, thirsting for
knowledge, spend lon# hours in the library absorbed in
lilerarv pursuits have become careless and are consistently
ignoring the rights of others.
Some of these potential Phi Betes, in their haste to se
cure some coveted book, discourteously park their cars in
the middle of the automobile lane at the south end of the
library, making it impossible for cars, already correctly
parked along the sides of the lane, to get out.
Such inconsiderate haste, even though it is in such a
noble cause as learning, is hardly becoming Stanford
gentlemen and gentlewomen. The time necessary to park
in the regular lines would not be sufficient to materially
alf eel the grades of these over-anxious students and the
facilitation of the parking around the building would be
well worth the effort.
A plea similar to this made by The Daily last year met
with a gratifying response and, for a long time after its
appearance, the spectacle of orderly rows of cars parked
at the side of the library warmed the hearts of all habitues
of that palace of culture.
However, the novelty of considerate parking wore off
after a while and now the conditions are as bad as ever.
If this editorial has as good an effect as the former one, it
can be reprinted periodically to remind the campus schol
ars that courtesy is not incompatible with a high bawl-out
average.
