# FORTUNE'S IRONIC SMILE
## 
### 
California's Bob Kiesel, one of the most promising
sprinters in the world today, may not compete for a place
011 the I nited States Olympic dash team because he doesn't
like to run.
The sporting public may or may not be justified in feel
ing indignant over the decision of the Berkeley Hash. That
is but an incidental ethical sidelight on a coincidence that
is striking in its illustration of human desires as Fortune's
playthings. ,
At the very moment when Kiesel was telling a sports
writer that he had decided not to compete, Leslie Hablcs,
a man who has come within a tenth of a second of his best
time in the hundred, was applying for a leave of absence
from Stanford. This means that Les, too, will probably be
out of the Olympics, lint not because he doesn't want to
run.
Behind Hablcs' leave of absence lies a story of misfor
tune 100 long to be told, too persistently luckless to be be
lieved. Strained muscles, tapeworm, sinus trouble, appendi
citis a multitude of ailments suflicient to kill the average
human, have dogged the tracks of Ibis game little athlete
since he first attracted notice as a star.
And still he wouldn't quit. He ran against California
in direct defiance of doctors' orders. He ran against I'.S.C,
with his future well-being in the balance. Not until two
days ago could physicians convince him that he must hang
up his spikes and take a rest. Hablcs loves track, and the
thrill of a race.
Yet California's Bob Kiesel, one of the most promising
sprinters in the world today, may not compete for a place
on the I'niled Slates Olympic dash team because he doesn't
like 1 to run!
