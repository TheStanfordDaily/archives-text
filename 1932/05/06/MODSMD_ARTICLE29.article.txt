# STILL NAMELESS

Last fall The Daily advanced the idea that the much j
heralded women's gymnasium ought to he dignified hv a
distinctive name. Although obviously a sound and brainy
sclieine, tin thought did not take, and nothing came of it. 1
Consequently, the glitiering pile which the Ii.A.C. lias raised
in the poppy fields remains forlornly unbaptised.
The official title is "â– women's gymnasium," a distinctly
prosaic cognomen and one which is unsatisfactory for prac
tical usage since, to avoid confusion with Hoble gym, it is
usual 1 v necessary to add the prefix "new."
While not a killing affair, this situation, nevertheless,
should be remedied. Surely the Californian's genius for
inventing picturesque titles lias not fallen to so low an ebb
that no one can provide anything suitable for the latest ;
addition to Stanford's architectural exhibits.
