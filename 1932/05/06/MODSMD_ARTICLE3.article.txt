# ROBLE TAKES A.P. HOAX, HOOK, LINE, AND COPY PAPER
## 
### 
No, the Lindbergh baby has
not been found. A giant hoax
starting in Charles E. Rogers'
copy reading class yesterday to
which most of the campus fell
victim has been uncovered, and
the perpetrator apprehended.
Said perpetrator conceived
the notion of writing a "Flash"
on A.P. copy paper stating that
the long-lost infant had been
returned to his anxious parents.
Little did he know or think
that one of the gullible under
lings would believe the report
and hasten to tell the glad tid
ings to his friends.
Thus it was that the Roble
Club president was greeted
with cheers when she an
nounced at luncheon yester
day that the "Associated Press
has just sent out a report that
the Lindbergh baby has been
found."
A hoax that went wrong!
