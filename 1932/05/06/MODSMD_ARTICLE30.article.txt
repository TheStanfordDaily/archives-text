# BULL SESSION
## SHOOT HIM IN HONOLULU 
### 
Governor Judd has freed the man j
| who admitted that he murdered an- j
j other man. Thus conclusively prov
j ing that if you wish to kill an in
-1 dividual, take him to Honolulu first,
j In that Jewel of the Pacific, where
!an enchanting moon bathes the j
; lithe brown bodies of the demure !
i dancers with a silvery splendor, j
| there—you can snuff out the life of I
a fellow mortal with a small piece |
| of lead and suffer but a "one hour" j
! sentence.
j It's gloriously romantic — hope- j
: lessly medieval —and intolerably un-
I just. A white woman has been at- ■
| tacked. She names the attacker.
I Her husband lets the law take its
course. The law fails to convict.
The husband in gallant knight-er
rant fashion rides out to avenge
outraged womanhood. He kills a
! man and is freed to the deafening i
, plaudits of the multitude. The only j
i break with the romanticized past is :
! that there was no challenge given— '
! just simply a cold-blooded killing.]
!
The fact that it was a cold-blooded
j rather than a hot-blooded affair I
| adds to the ghastliness of the situa- !
t ation. If Massie had shot several
; hours after the crime, we might
have excused him as a man who
had .lost his head in the rush of \
circumstances. But Massie con
tained himself for several weeks, !
allowing the law to act. Then jus
tice fails to satisfy his "wrong." The j:
prime motive behind his killing was I
not the honor of his wife; several;;
weeks had given that time to cool 1
to the reasonable level. The urge to j
kill the accused Hawaiian was re- |.
venge and the brutal rage of a man .
that has been crossed.

| Massie was willing that the scales
jof justice should decide until the
j balance f ailed to swing in his direc
! tion. The cry has gone up that a
{ white woman is not safe in Hawaii.
I That may be true; I don't know.
! But now everybody knows th;it the
| Pacific Paradise i.s not safe for a
! brown man. The government that
we have imposed on them will not
|grant them justice. The precedent
| has been set. Whenever a native is
| not convicted by a court for some
1 serious charge, it behooves the
j white man to make the execution
jof the law a personal matter. He
j will not be censured for so doing.
lOn the contrary, the government
j will sanction his action by a pardon.
The Hawaiian affair is novel in
only one respect—the attempt to
bring Massie to justice. Here, on
the mainland, many darker-skinned
| men have paid and paid in horrible
[ fashion with their lives on the
J charge by some white woman. We
I in the United States are accustomed
to the killing of the black by the
white. We were startled by the
presumptious attempt to convict the
white man. Hence all the publicity
on the Massie case.
The negro has been taught bit
terly what to expect in America.
This case will teach the Hawaiians
a similar lesson. Now, when the re
port of a pistol rings through the
clear Pacific night, the soft strum
ming of the guitars should not stop
—the gentle swaying of the grass
skirted hips should not slacken—
the patting of the bare feet on the
hard white sand should not cease.
Let them realize simply that White
Man's Justice has been done.
