THE COHENS AND KELLYS IN
HOLLYWOOD—At the Varsity
Theatre.
George Sidney and Charlie Mur
the scenes in dear old Hollywood.
The makes and breaks in the movie
colony is the theme of the satire,
with Norman Foster and June Clyde
furnishing the love interest.
The Kellys get a break in the
movie colony and proceed to "go
Hollywood." June Clyde, as the
exotic "find," manages to carry
through a lot of hokum on and off
the set. But when the Cohens
wheeze into town, the fun begins.
Norman Foster, who really has a
rather good talking and singing
voice, finds the girl of his dreams
riding a high-horse. However, the
boy makes good and the Cohens
cash in. Just to let you in on a
secret, they purchase a Beverly
Hills home, calling it the "Hacienda
de Cohen."
A nice piece of photography in -
side the famous Cocoanut Grove'
compensates for a not-so-funny
piece of slapstick between Sidney
and Murray.
Norman Foster cops the acting
honors as a music grinder on the
lot. He times a perfect bit of "bird
ing" on the organ when a pansy
director is strutting his stuff.
The plot on the whole is awfully
weak, bvit June Clyde has a good
figure. —J.B.
BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK—At
the New Stanford.
A father and son pictui'e in which ;
the aforementioned father and son
manage a goodly amount of high
finance and high romance with the
ladies. Robert Montgomery, playing ;
the part of the son, of course, gets j
into a certain amount of difficulty j
by falling in love with the more- j

| charming but less-wealthy of the
i two possibilities.
Members of the "500" who see the
i picture will sigh softly and secretly j
! wish to heaven they would meet a j
j persistent and dashing hero like j
\ Robert Montgomery. As for the
j "roughs," they will respond blithely
Ito the charms of Montgomery's
i "chosen" and slyly take a few men- j
! tal notes on his irresistable tech- :
| nique.
Believe it or not, one of the shorts j
is really amusing and what's more— i
Mickey Mouse is coming Saturday! !

j BEHIND THE MASK—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
This is another Jack Holt thriller
with a touch of horror added just
to season the dish. It's really very 1
! good. The plot is continuous, not |
jerky, and the acting smooth and 1
! well interpreted.
| Of course the picture has some !
j flaws. For instance, right in the most :
•thrilling and active part of the pic- j
ture, the hero stops to embrace the ,
heroine. Of course, taking time ou?
I for that sort of thing may be all j
| right from the aesthetic sense, but j
j it sort of spoils the action, because j
! we know the villain is getting away. |
As for Boris Karloff, we found i
that the "monster" of Frankenstein j
is really human and can be made ,
up to look like a first-class dope- i
! runner. He looks real tough with a j
,derby on.
Of course the story is more or j
! less of a stereotype— such pictures I
i always are. The Secret Service i
agent falls in love with the daugh- :
ter of a henchman of the big shot, j
There's a good Chic Sale comedy
j—and the rest of the shorts are .
i awful. Go at 7:20 o'clock.
—J.H.G.
