Asia |
Dear Sirs:
Received yours of Ist inst . . .
What about it?
Perfectly willing to admit, if any
body wonders, that Asia is sort of
a large place for a post mark. But j
as a matter of fact, we feel sort of
like we did the night of our fra
ternity initiation quest, except that
we can't even understand a word j
these ginks are saying. And we're
not the least bit certain about where
we are. If you know, it would be j
absolutely swell of you to It us
in on the secret.
At any rate, we've been to Tibet i
—meaning that we've hit the high |
spots there—and the most startling
thing we found out is that it',
strictly against the native religion j
to gamble. It's this way: We went I
up to an old guy in a long white
robe and said, "I'd like tibet you
that it takes lassa fire in the winter
to keep you warm up here," and
he only looked as though he didn't j
understand, and then suddenly j
burst out into tinny laughter. Either i
they're all crazy or our accent's !
wrong.
What we need is a couple of
Men's Council presidents to
lend us the proper air of sol
emnity, and mebbc a Y.W. sec- 1

retary for firm moral support.
Of course, a Chi I'si hasher
would really be the most digni
fied of all.
From up on the roof of the world j
iit was comparatively simple to look!
. down and see how Mother India
was getting along. The favorite na
tional pastime, as you may have
heard, is a game called "Crossing {
j the Ganges for Gandhi." As nearly j
as we could figure it out, it strongly \
! resembles a good session of con- |
| tract bridge, and when you go set, !
you work on the rock pile for a 1
couple of years. |
We have at last come to real
i izc and perhaps even remotely
admire the Dekes back home
for their adherence to Gandhi's
cause. Look at the roof of the
Deke house from Prexy's Hill,
any warm afternoon, and you'll
understand what we mean. The
native Indians, however, differ
somewhat from the DKE tribe,
in that they sometimes refrain
from commenting upon pedes
trians casually passing their
houses.
j Ennyhow, here we are at a very •
! safe distance, among the hot desert
I sands, simply thinking of Turkey, j
i in the roasting, as it were. We'
1 hoped to visit Turkey on this trip, j

land especially Istanbul. That issue
: a romantic old place, and we've re
I cently learned that one of our mot
j respected institutions, th
| Stock Market, took some of it
common lingo indirectly from th
el»y.
There used to he a good deal
of slave trading there and at its
sister city, Istanhear. The two
trade markets were rivals, hut
Istanhear became known as the
source of better slaves, and the
buyers would simply question
about a slave, 'Istanbul or Istan
! bear?" Stock buyers on Wall
i Street are said to ask the same
question about certain slaves of
finance—"ls't an bull or Is't an
: bear?" You can understand the
logic of that, of course . . .
Yes, and we've finally seen a re;
j hottentot (we wonder, ourselve
I how we ever got over in this nec
!of the woods) but we were ri
I lieved and astounded, no less, o
i account of having always iliougl
' that a hottentot was a
j sandwich with mustard on it. C

We have at last come to real
