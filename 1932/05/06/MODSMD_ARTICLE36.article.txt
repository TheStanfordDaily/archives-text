NOT EVERYBODY keeps up on
horse racing. Neither does every
body follow football closely, or pro
fessional baseball. But there are
few who don't become hot and
bothered about the Bij; Game, the
Harvard-Yale fracas, or the World
Series.
And so it is with the Kentucky
Derby. People who have never seen
a horse race, or never expect to,
for that matter, suddenly develop
interest in the Louisville classic the
first part of every May.
The 58th running of the Derby
at Churchill Downs tomorrow will
hold special attraction for coast
fans, not only because of the in
terest in the sport created by the
races at Tanforan, but because a
San Jose nag, the Northway Stable's
Gallant Sir, will be an entry. Gal
lant Sir will be an outsider, but is
conceded a chance to be up among
'em when they finish.
TWO FAMOUS jockeys will
be attempting comebacks to
morrow. Both will be riding
mounts carrying the silks of
Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Earl
Sande, one of the most famous
jockeys of all time, will be up
011 Overtime seeking his fourth
Derby victory, while Buddy
Ensor will be up on Stepan
fctchit trying to boot home his
first winner.
Sande has already had con
siderable success this season
after a period of retirement.
Only one other jockey, Isaac
Murphy (believe it or not, he
was a negro), has ridden three
Derby winners. Murphy won on
Buchanan in 1884, Riley in 1890,
and Kingman in 1881. Sande
won on Zev in 1!>23, Flying Eb
ony in 15)25, and Gallant Fox in
if»;{().
Ten years ago. before Sande
became the premier rider of the
country, Ensor occupied the
throne. Then lie sassed a racing
official, or something, and was
ruled off the turf.
Now he is down to weight
again and is trying to recoup
his fortune. He has a good
chance to win on Stepenfetchit
tomorrow.
SPEAKING OF racing, two events
of more than ordinary interest are
billed for nearby tracks tomorrow.
At Tanforan the Governor Rolph
Handicap will attract the fleetest
steeds at the track. Polydorus, who
has won so consistently options on
him pay little more than interest on
the investment, will face stiff com
petition in Joe Flores, Yonkel, Ba
hamas, Sidney Grant, and a number
of others.
At Belmont followers of the purps
will be treated to an extra attrac
tion, a match race between Play
goer II and Crony. These two dogs
are regarded as among the most
outstanding greyhounds in the
country.
During the current meeting at
Belmont they have met twice, each
winning once. Favorites often are
hindered as the pack rounds the
turns in regular races, but this
match event should definitely settle
the matter of which dog is the fast
est. This attraction will be in addi
tion to the regular program of 10
races.
WITH BASEBALL season
over, Sam Barry, taciturn chief
of basketball and baseball af
fairs at U.S.C., will call for
spring cage practice Monday.
And despite the fact that stal
ling will be illegal next season,
it looks as if the Trojans will
be the team to beat.
Lettermcn who will report
back to Barry are Jerry Nemer,
champion scorer of the coast,
Boh Erskine, huge forward and
center who is campus Ford
agent in his spare time, Julius
Bescos, Sax Elliott, and "Sonny"
Anderson.
Add to them a group of the
fastest freshman players ever
assembled on one team on the
coast, and you have the founda
tion for SOME basketball team.

'em when they finish.
TWO FAMOUS jockeys will
be attempting comebacks to
morrow. Both will be riding
mounts carrying the silks of
Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Earl
Sande, one of the most famous
jockeys of all time, will be up
011 Overtime seeking his fourth
Derby victory, while Buddy
Ensor will be up on Stepan
fctchit trying to boot home his
first winner.
Sande has already had con
siderable success this season
after a period of retirement.
Only one other jockey, Isaac
Murphy (believe it or not, he
was a negro), has ridden three
Derby winners. Murphy won on
Buchanan in 1884, Riley in 1890,
and Kingman in 1881. Sande
won on Zev in 1!>23, Flying Eb
ony in 15)25, and Gallant Fox in
if»;{().
Ten years ago. before Sande
became the premier rider of the
country, Ensor occupied the
throne. Then lie sassed a racing
official, or something, and was
ruled off the turf.
Now he is down to weight
again and is trying to recoup
his fortune. He has a good
chance to win on Stepenfetchit
tomorrow.
SPEAKING OF racing, two events
of more than ordinary interest are
billed for nearby tracks tomorrow.
At Tanforan the Governor Rolph
Handicap will attract the fleetest
steeds at the track. Polydorus, who
has won so consistently options on
him pay little more than interest on
the investment, will face stiff com
petition in Joe Flores, Yonkel, Ba
hamas, Sidney Grant, and a number
of others.
At Belmont followers of the purps
will be treated to an extra attrac
tion, a match race between Play
goer II and Crony. These two dogs
are regarded as among the most
outstanding greyhounds in the
country.
During the current meeting at
Belmont they have met twice, each
winning once. Favorites often are
hindered as the pack rounds the
turns in regular races, but this
match event should definitely settle
the matter of which dog is the fast
est. This attraction will be in addi
tion to the regular program of 10
races.
WITH BASEBALL season
over, Sam Barry, taciturn chief
of basketball and baseball af
fairs at U.S.C., will call for
spring cage practice Monday.
And despite the fact that stal
ling will be illegal next season,
it looks as if the Trojans will
be the team to beat.
Lettermcn who will report
back to Barry are Jerry Nemer,
champion scorer of the coast,
Boh Erskine, huge forward and
center who is campus Ford
agent in his spare time, Julius
Bescos, Sax Elliott, and "Sonny"
Anderson.
Add to them a group of the
fastest freshman players ever
assembled on one team on the
coast, and you have the founda
tion for SOME basketball team.
—L.M.C.
NOT EVERYBODY keeps up on
horse racing. Neither does every
body follow football closely, or pro
fessional baseball. But there are
few who don't become hot and
bothered about the Bij; Game, the
Harvard-Yale fracas, or the World
Series.
And so it is with the Kentucky
Derby. People who have never seen
a horse race, or never expect to,
for that matter, suddenly develop
interest in the Louisville classic the
first part of every May.
The 58th running of the Derby
at Churchill Downs tomorrow will
hold special attraction for coast
fans, not only because of the in
terest in the sport created by the
races at Tanforan, but because a
San Jose nag, the Northway Stable's
Gallant Sir, will be an entry. Gal
lant Sir will be an outsider, but is
conceded a chance to be up among
'em when they finish.
