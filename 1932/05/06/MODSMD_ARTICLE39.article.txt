To capture the League II hard
ball championship, the Theta Chi
ball club wound up the league sea
son with a whirlwind finish yester
day afternoon when the men from
up the I\ow battered the El Capitan
nine to win a 27 to 0 triumph.
With their 13-10 win over the
S.A.E.'s in yesterday's title play, the
Alpha Sig ball outfit moved out of
a second place tie with the S.A.E.'s
in the League II standing to take
an undisputed runner-up position
behind the league-winning Theta
Chi's. The Sigma Chi diamond men
claimed the second league cham
pionship of the day when the Row
club earned an 8 to 7 victory from
El Toro to grab the League I title.
Record Score
The Theta Chi nine piled up the
greatest mass of runs yet to be
claimed by a hard ball team for one
game this season, and at the same
time held the El Capitan team
down to only one hit and no runs.
With 10 strike-outs to his credit,
Rolley Howe from up the Row
pitched his greatest game. Howe re
tired the Capitan squad in short
order, inning by inning. The lone
hit for the Club men came in the
fourth when Weeks connected for a
safe bingle.
Bursting forth with eight runs in
the first inning, the Theta Chi outfit
hounded Pitcher Quinn and his field
divisions for at least a couple of
runs for every frame. Fifteen safe
hits accounted for 27 runs. Walks
and errors made up the difference.
Not one man from Theta Chi ham
mered out more than two hits.
Baxter Homes
To end up in second place in
League 11, the Alpha Sigs came
forth with an easy win from the
S.A.E.'s. Banging out seven runs for
six hits in the second, the winners
took an early lead which was
threatened only by a last-inning
rally from the S.A.E.'s.
Bob Baxter of the Alpha Sigs
claimed all laurels for prospective
Bambinos with his circuit clout and
two hits for three times at bat. Bax
ter's homer came in the sixth to
bring in two men ahead of him.
Fitcher Jim Feely of the S.A.E.'s
accounted for the other home run
of the game along with two addi
tional runs. Moore hurled for the
victorious Alpha Sigs.
