Games at Los Angeles.)

Just how much will "Blazin' Ben"' f
Eastman have left when he lines up \
for his sixth race of the Olympic i
Games, facing Lieutenant G. Ram- ;
pling of England in the final of the j
400 meters?
''Blazin' Ben" will have to run ,
two preliminary 800-meter races, i
averaging about 1 minute, 53 sec
onds, and an 800-meter final sev
eral seconds faster, as well as two
preliminary 400-meter heats at
about 47.8 seconds each, before he
comes to his mark next to a much
fresher Rampling, who would be
little less than an even money bet
against Eastman under equal con
ditions.
Eastman Tired
Eastman will be as tired as a run
ner with his superhuman strength
can be by the time the 400-meter
final is run, while Rampling, who
runs his races just fast enough to
win and has never been extended
since he began his real racing career
only two years ago, will have done
no more than coast through two
easy preliminary victories.
Forty-eight seconds is Rampling's
best mark in a race, because he has
yet to meet a better than 48.5 sec
ond runner. In the final lap of the
England-Germany relay, Rampling
bad to make up many yards to win
the race, but win he did, and was
clocked in 46.6 seconds. If Eastman
runs the 800-meters, and he prob
abily will, Lieutenant Rampling |
should hand Stanford's greatest 1
runner his first defeat since the !
1.C.4-A. of 1931.

England presents one of her
strongest threats in the 400 meters,
for besides the probable winner in
Rampling, Engelhardt and Leigh-
Wood, both veterans from the 1928
Olympics, will be running for the
Union Jack. Besides Metzner and
Buchner, who took third at Am
sterdam, Germany has Storz, fifth
place winner in 1928. Andre Mou
lines and Robert Feger of France
have both touched 48 seconds flat.
Canadian Runners
Canada had three men in the
semi-finals at Amsterdam, Phil Ed
wards, Alex Wilson, and Johnny Ball,
who, after winning his semi-final in
48.6 seconds, ran a poorly timed
race in the final at Amsterdam.
Coming into the home stretch 15
yards behind Ray Barbuti, and
running a bad sixth, Ball mowed
down his opponents one by one and
failed by less than a foot to catch
the American champion. The win
ning time, a new Olympic record,
was 47.8 seconds. Although he has
done little running since 1928, Ball
may be a real factor at Los Angeles.
Barbuti's victory was the only
United States flat race victory at
Amsterdam. Backing up Eastman
will be two other 400-meter men
chosen from Vic Williams, who beat
Eastman last year in 47.4 seconds,
Art Woessner, U.S.C. senior who
has done 47.8 seconds, Johnny Mc-
Carthy and Jim Gordon, both 47.8
second men, and Frank Steele, of
Pittsburgh, Horace Whitney of Col
gate, and Ed Haynes, of Denver.
What an unbeatable combination
this bunch should furnish for the
American 1600-meter relay team!

Eastman last year in 47.4 seconds,
Art Woessner, U.S.C. senior who
has done 47.8 seconds, Johnny Mc-
Carthy and Jim Gordon, both 47.8
second men, and Frank Steele, of
Pittsburgh, Horace Whitney of Col
gate, and Ed Haynes, of Denver.
What an unbeatable combination
this bunch should furnish for the
American 1600-meter relay team!

Games at Los Angeles.)

Just how much will "Blazin' Ben"' f
Eastman have left when he lines up \
for his sixth race of the Olympic i
Games, facing Lieutenant G. Ram- ;
pling of England in the final of the j
400 meters?
''Blazin' Ben" will have to run ,
two preliminary 800-meter races, i
averaging about 1 minute, 53 sec
onds, and an 800-meter final sev
eral seconds faster, as well as two
preliminary 400-meter heats at
about 47.8 seconds each, before he
comes to his mark next to a much
fresher Rampling, who would be
little less than an even money bet
against Eastman under equal con
ditions.
Eastman Tired
Eastman will be as tired as a run
ner with his superhuman strength
can be by the time the 400-meter
final is run, while Rampling, who
runs his races just fast enough to
win and has never been extended
since he began his real racing career
only two years ago, will have done
no more than coast through two
easy preliminary victories.
Forty-eight seconds is Rampling's
best mark in a race, because he has
yet to meet a better than 48.5 sec
ond runner. In the final lap of the
England-Germany relay, Rampling
bad to make up many yards to win
the race, but win he did, and was
clocked in 46.6 seconds. If Eastman
runs the 800-meters, and he prob
abily will, Lieutenant Rampling |
should hand Stanford's greatest 1
runner his first defeat since the !
1.C.4-A. of 1931.

England presents one of her
strongest threats in the 400 meters,
for besides the probable winner in
Rampling, Engelhardt and Leigh-
Wood, both veterans from the 1928
Olympics, will be running for the
Union Jack. Besides Metzner and
Buchner, who took third at Am
sterdam, Germany has Storz, fifth
place winner in 1928. Andre Mou
lines and Robert Feger of France
have both touched 48 seconds flat.
Canadian Runners
Canada had three men in the
semi-finals at Amsterdam, Phil Ed
wards, Alex Wilson, and Johnny Ball,
who, after winning his semi-final in
48.6 seconds, ran a poorly timed
race in the final at Amsterdam.
Coming into the home stretch 15
yards behind Ray Barbuti, and
running a bad sixth, Ball mowed
down his opponents one by one and
failed by less than a foot to catch
the American champion. The win
ning time, a new Olympic record,
was 47.8 seconds. Although he has
done little running since 1928, Ball
may be a real factor at Los Angeles.
Barbuti's victory was the only
United States flat race victory at
Amsterdam. Backing up Eastman
will be two other 400-meter men
chosen from Vic Williams, who beat
Eastman last year in 47.4 seconds,
Art Woessner, U.S.C. senior who
has done 47.8 seconds, Johnny Mc-
Carthy and Jim Gordon, both 47.8
second men, and Frank Steele, of
Pittsburgh, Horace Whitney of Col
gate, and Ed Haynes, of Denver.
