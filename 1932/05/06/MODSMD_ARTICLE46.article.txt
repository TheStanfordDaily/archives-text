# TANFORAN CRAMP CONCEDED SMALL CHANCE IN DERBY
## Tick On, Liberty Limited, Favorites To Win At Churchill Downs 
### 
Although Universe and Top
Flight, the two big favorites for the
race, have been scratched from the
Kentucky Derby entry list, Gallant
Sir, the greatest Western threat to
win the classic mile and a quarter
race, is conceded little chance to
j finish in the money.
Following workouts on Churchill
Downs yesterday afternoon, Tick
On and Liberty Limited were in
stalled as favorites to win the race,
with most of the money going on
the first horse. Lucky Tom, Stepin
fetchit, Gold Check, Cathop, and
Brother Joe are conceded good
chances, with Gallant Sir an out
side possibility.
Gallant Sir, after a fairly suc
cessful campaign :it Tanforan, fin
ished sixth in his only trial race at
Churchill Downs. Odds of 25-1 were
offered on the Western horse in San
Francisco, with as much as 50-1
available in the East for backers of
the Tanforan champion.
