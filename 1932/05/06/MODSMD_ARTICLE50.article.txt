WASHINGTON, May 5. (/P)â€”The
World-wide search for the kidnaped
Lindbergh baby was echoed dra
matically today in the arrest of
Gaston B. Means on a charge of
obtaining $100,000 on false repre
sentations that he could obtain the
child from his abductors.
Department of Justice agents ar
rested the former, Justice Depart
ment investigator after a secret in
quiry into allegations that he had
been paid the money by Mrs. Ed
ward B. McLean, wife of the pub
lisher of the Washington Post.
Mrs. McLean said in a statement
through her attorney, Albert W.
Fox, that Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh, father of the kidnaped child,
knew of her activities, but tha?
they were kept secret from her
closest friends.
Means was released from the At
lanta Penitentiary July 19, 1928,
after serving terms for conviction
in New York of prohibition conspir
acy and of attempted bribery in
connection with the operation of
the Craeger Glass Casket Company.
After his release he published a
book, "The Strange Death of Presi
dent Harding," which caused a
furor. The book recently was re
pudiated by a co-author.
