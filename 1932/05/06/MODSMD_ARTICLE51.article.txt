### 
Cord-clad roughs and a few j
members of the "500," milling about j
ihe miniature of the De Soto auto- ;
mobile assembly plant at the En- i
gineering Corner yesterday, ex- j
pressed their disappointment with i
the exhibition.
For the plant did not actually as
semble tiny cars, as the company
had promised. True, the assembly
lines moved along and chains hur
rying along overhead carried chas
sis, axles, and bodies. But when the
proper place for assembly came
along, everything disappeared con
veniently behind a screen, to reap
pear presently and repeat the pro
cess.
Nevertheless it was an interesting
sight, with the little cars rolling out
at the end of the plant and into y.
railroad shed as if driven, tiny red
tail lights blinking bravely.
Not a little of the attraction was
Pete De Paolo, famous racing
driver, debonair and friendly, mov
ing about among the students and
telling them of his experiences in J
racing. He found in the crowd sev- j
oral student friends from down j
South. His home is in Los Angeles. \
