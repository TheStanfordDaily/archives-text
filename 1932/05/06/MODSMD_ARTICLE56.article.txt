# ROOSEVELT-GARNER COMBINE RUMORED
## Vice-Presidency Offer To Texan Considered 
### 
NEW YORK. May 5. (/P)â€”Serious
consideration is being given to the
! possibility of offering John N. Gar
' ner th" Democratic vice-presiden- !
| tial nomination and lining up Gar- |
! tier's presidential support behind |
| Franklin D. Roosevelt, it was j
i learned tonight in the Roosevelt j
| camp.
j Garner's victory in the three
j cornered race for California's forty
j four delegates and the assurance he
! will get the forty-six from Texas
i have made him a formidable figure
! in the preconvention picture. Roose- j
j velt's campaign managers are con- i
vinced the New York governor will j
be shy only about 100 votes of the
770 necessary for nomination when
the convention opens next month.
Garner's ninety, in that event, would
almost clinch the nomination.
No overtures have been made,
however, to Garner as yet, it was
said.
