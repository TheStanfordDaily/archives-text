# ROBLE TENNIS AND PING-PONG TROPHIES REMAIN UNCLAIMED
## 
### 
Roble Club can boast of a new i
phenomena. Champions without !
cups have been heard of, but seldom !
cups without champions. Some kind
soul anonymously donated four
bright and shining trophies to Roble I
to be given to the winners of the |
tennis singles and doubles tourna- 1
merits and the ping-pong tourna- j
mcnt.
These tournaments have been run- :
ning for four weeks now, and only !
four players have gone beyond the !
second round in the singles matches; i
only two matches have been played j
in the doubles, while a like number
have been played in the ping-pong j
fracas. It would seem that Roble's j
shining cups will continue indefin- j
itely to collect dust in Scotly Mc- j
Dougall's room.
Scotly McDougall and Kate Maus
moved to the semi-finals of the
doubles tournament when they de
feated Mary Rechif and Rowine
Hayes, 6-2, 6-1. Dot Anne Jackson i
and Mary Pike, in the only other I
match that has been played in this '
tournament, moved to the second'
round, defeating Lucile Smith and j
Elizabeth Lilienthal.
Esther Pickering defeated Marian i
McElwain in a hard-fought ping-1
pong battle, 23-21, 24-22, and Mar- .
joric Buettner eliminated Kate Maus,
but the other players in the ping- j
pong tournament have not played !
any matches.
