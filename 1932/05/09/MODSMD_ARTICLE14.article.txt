### LUCILE SMITH 
Featuring a professionally polished i
concert pianist, a talented flute-!
player, a pleasing bass soloist, and |
j a trio whose playing showed prac
tice and appreciation, Toyon Club's 1
i annual musicale given in the hall!
last night was a complete success, j
Presented before an unusually large j
audience, the affair was an artistic l
triumph as well as an enjoyable I
evening's entertainment.
A trio composed of Elizabeth
Moser and Marion Terwilliger, vio
linists, and Henry Moser, piano,
started the program with Moszkow
ski's Suite, opus 71. The four move
ments, allegro energico, allegro
moderator lentoassai, and molto
vivace, formed a selection of charm
and interest, the last movement
being especially enjoyable and ex~
| pertly rendered.
Flute Players
The next number on the program I
was a group of flute selections,!
1 played by Otto Allen Will, accom- :
j panied by Grosvenor W. Cooper. |
"By the Brook" was a beautifully j
] realistic piece with a great many j
I trills very skillfully played. Next j
I came the melodious, lilting notes of I
! Donjon's "Rossignolet." "Papillon," j
by Kohlcr, a colorful, suggestive se- j
j lection, was followed by a delight- j
I ful encore, "Chasse Aux Papillons," i
j by L. Fontbonne.
Donald Morgan's pleasing bass,
j voice, confident, deep, and flexible, !
j was next heard in a group of Ger- i
I man songs. Most beautiful of all was |
I that selection which John Charles j
I Thomas has called "a household j
| word," Wagner's surpassingly beau- |
! tiful "Evening Star" aria from '<
Tannhauser. This was preceded by I
' Brahms' "Sappische Ode," whose '
j calm, low notes were suggestive of i
!a smoothly flowing river, such as'
j his own beloved Danube. "Still wie.
j die Nacht," by Bohrn, with all the [
I moving grandeur of a Bach, was
j followed by a short, light encore,
! 'Ein Kleines Leid," by Dr. True.
! Ruth Morgan was the accompanist.
L.A. Pianist
Ruth Harper, concert pianist from j
1 Los Angeles, then presented three I
! Chopin numbers, playing them with 1
! the perfection of technique which !
i the works of this master demand.
! The stirring "Revolutionary Pre
j lude," the intricate fingering of
j which makes it especially difficult,
was forcefully played.
"Etude in E Major," considered
by Chopin to be one of his finest i
etudes, was given with great sym- !
pathy for the loveliness of this sub- i
lime melody. Her last selection, i
"Ballade in A Flat," ended the eve- ,
ning in a brilliant manner. Rhyth- j
mical, and with a variety of pleas- j
ing movements, this powerful work 1
reached the finest height of the pro- j
gram.
