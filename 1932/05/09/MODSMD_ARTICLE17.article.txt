# LEOB, WHEELER GIVEN PARTS IN OPERA CHORUS
## Cast Of "Two's Company" Is Well Known On Stanford Stage 
### 
A complete list of chorines for
j "Two's Company," the Junior Opera,
i was announced by Fred Pearman,
I co-director of the chorus which will
| be one of the major attractions of
I the show. Outstanding among the
; members of the group include Mar
garet Loeb and Kathleen Wheeler.
Others selected for the occasion
consist of Ann King, Barbara Bal
four, Josephine Wilson, Marion
Slonaker, Betty Watson, Esther
Scott and Mary Hurt. They will be
featured in the "pony chorus," and
will also engage in four other num
bers during the evening.
Principles in the cast for "Two's
Company," with Ben Kagen as au
! thor, consist of Josephine Wilson,
who will take the part of "Johnnie,"
j a chorine, Jean Jamison as Joan
I Richmond, Jack Redhead as "Eddie,"
| a publicity man, Terence Geddis as
j "The Big Gangster," Harold Davis
|as "Mr. Kauffman," Eph Engelman
|as "Gus," William Mahu as "Hal
! Kirby," and Kay Wheeler as
! "Swifty," a comedian. With the ex-
I ception of Miss Wheeler, who is
j rated as a first class "tapper," all
j the members have had previence ex-
I perience in Stanford dramatics.
Harold Davis, Jack Redhead, Jean
j Jamison and Eph Engleman have
I appeared in productions of the Big
| Game Gaieties. Miss Jamison and
i Eph will be particularly remem
j bered for their parts in last year's
j Gaieties. Redhead has also taken
| part in Milne's "The Ivory Door."
(Josephine Wilson has taken part in
j "Proletariat Plus," last year's Jun
t ior Opera written by Don Cameron.
Barbara Collins, who has been se
! lected to take the part of "Goldy,"
has distinguished herself in such
plays as "The Mistress of Briony,"
and "Berkeley Square." Terence
Geddis hardly needs mention as
| having appeared in "Berkeley
I Square," and "Wings Over Europe."
i Mary Anita Loos as Martha, the ne
j gro maid, and Paul Van Dusen as
I "Premium" complete the cast.
A show within a show hardly
characterizes the theme for the Op
era, which has a backstage setting
and provides numerous spots for
specialty numbers. Harold Helven
ston has announced that an entirely
[ different treatment of "the scenes
j behind the curtain" will be made.
| Fred Pearman, who is at present
j engaged in rounding the chorus into
! shape, is also appearing as a mcm
j ber of the cast. He will take the
1 part of a music director. A few of
I the minor parts have been enlarged
! to conform with the expanded ver-
I sion of the plot.
The Opera, which will take place
after the Junior Water Carnival and
j Cord Ball on May 14, is part of the
! program for Junior Week.
Tickets for the Junior Opera will
i go on sale tomorrow afternoon at 1
i o'clock in front of the Women's
i Clubhouse. Ducats are priced at
$1.50, $1.25, and $1.
