# World Marks Shattered On Fresno Track
## Stanford Set Mile Relay Time Last Year 
### 
The hard-packed cinders and
| springy runways of Fresno State
i College's great track have witnessed
{the breaking of six world's records
i during the last three years. And
1 when the stars of Stanford, U.S.C.,
the L.A.A.C., the Olympic Club,
| California, etc., arc through their
i antics Saturday in the sixth annual
j West Coast relays, another mark or
| two may join the procession,
j Perhaps outstanding among them
jail and certainly of most interest to
i this Farm was the time of three
minutes, twelve and six-tenths sec
| onds for the mile relay recorded by
j the two Hables, Maynor Shove, and
1 Ben Eastman of Stanford last year.
This mark eclipsed the best that
i even the finest quarter-milers of
j entire nations have been able to do,
as it beats the Olympic Games mark
i as well as all others.-
In 1929, Lee Barnes pole-vaulted
14 feet IV2 inches—which record
i still stands—if a pole-vault record
lean be said to stand. Frank Wykoff
j ran the century in 9.5 last year to
lie Eddie Tolan's accepted world's
i mark.
Assisted by Delby, Guyer, and
Maurer, WykofT hung up a new in
ternational mark of 40.8 in the 440-
! yard relay last year. And in 1928,
j John Kuck threw the shot 51 feet
! V 2 inch and got credit for a new
! mark that has since been surpassed.
The two remaining records are
held by high school stars. Floyd
[ Wilson of Rivcrdale High broad
i jumped 23 feet 10% inches last year
to break the world's interscholastic
| mark and Walter Marty did the
| same thing to the high-jump record
1 when he leaped G feet 4'4 in 1929.
