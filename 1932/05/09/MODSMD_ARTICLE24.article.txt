# 14 Indian Trackmen Will Participate in Fresno Relay Meet
## Mile Relay Team, Ten Individual Stars to Constitute Indian Strength; Meier in Highs and Ray in Javelin Plan Revenge on Trojans

SINGLE RELAY TEAM and ten individual entries will form Stanford's
contingent to the big all-Coast relay meet at Fresno Saturday. Bill
Ellington, Dink Templeton, and Al Masters finally decided to send only
the mile quartet to the affair, while a hurdler, thr.ee pole-vaulters, a
javelin-thrower, a broad-jumper, and four wcightmcn complete the total
of 14. This small (but select) group includes Wally Butler in the broad

Faster and Faster
Gus Meier, who will run the highs
!at Fresno, continues to improve as
the weeks roll along. Meier ran be
tween 14.7 and 14.8 in a time trial
last Friday, and he is all het up
about meeting Payne, Welch, and
Bills of U.S.C. again.
However, reports from the South,
where the newspapers co-operate
with the various coaches by issuing
serious statements about injured
stars every time someone runs so
fast that Cromwell fears his oppo
sition will be scared out and wants
to reassure them, indicate that the
] star Trojan hurdlers will not enter
1 1 ho individual high hurdle race.
They figure to save themselves for
the shuttle relay and hang up a new
world's record.
A Good Idea
This formal statement gag is a
good idea. Suppose Stanford had
beaten U.S.C. in their dual track
meet —just suppose it, it's lots of
fun. Then Troy would have lost be
cause Jimmy Payne and Frank
WykofT couldn't run and Bob Hall
has had a bad wrist all season. Of
course, Payne took two seconds in
the hurdles, WykofT won the dashes,
and Hall surprised with a third in
the discus, but that is merely in
cidental to the main point of suf
fering tracksters who run around
for weeks on crutches—even if they
do ru naround the track on spikes
whenever meet-days come around.
Ail of which means that Meier
may not get a chance to renew his
acquaintance with Welch and Payne
and Bills (they've beaten him once
—why should they rechance their
reputations) and then again he may.
More Revenge
A1 Ray also has high ideas of re
venge. It seems that the thought of
a Trojan javelin-thrower who
hadn't done over 188 feet previous
to the Stanford-U.S.C. meet and
who then beat Ray by five-eighths
of an inch at a distance over 194
feet irks A1 considerably.
Ray will be able to fight it out
with Williamson all he wants, and
both of them can watch Ken
Churchill and Jimmie DeMers put
on one of the day's greatest duels
for first place—both Churchill and
DeMers being national champions
of a kind.

A Good Idea
This formal statement gag is a
good idea. Suppose Stanford had
beaten U.S.C. in their dual track
meet —just suppose it, it's lots of
fun. Then Troy would have lost be
cause Jimmy Payne and Frank
WykofT couldn't run and Bob Hall
has had a bad wrist all season. Of
course, Payne took two seconds in
the hurdles, WykofT won the dashes,
and Hall surprised with a third in
the discus, but that is merely in
cidental to the main point of suf
fering tracksters who run around
for weeks on crutches—even if they
do ru naround the track on spikes
whenever meet-days come around.
Ail of which means that Meier
may not get a chance to renew his
acquaintance with Welch and Payne
and Bills (they've beaten him once
—why should they rechance their
reputations) and then again he may.
More Revenge
A1 Ray also has high ideas of re
venge. It seems that the thought of
a Trojan javelin-thrower who
hadn't done over 188 feet previous
to the Stanford-U.S.C. meet and
who then beat Ray by five-eighths
of an inch at a distance over 194
feet irks A1 considerably.
Ray will be able to fight it out
with Williamson all he wants, and
both of them can watch Ken
Churchill and Jimmie DeMers put
on one of the day's greatest duels
for first place—both Churchill and
DeMers being national champions
of a kind.

javelin-thrower, a broad-jumper, and four wcightmcn complete the total
of 14. This small (but select) group includes Wally Butler in the broad
