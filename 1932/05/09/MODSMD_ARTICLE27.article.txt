## 
### 
LIMA, Peru, May 8. </P>—Sailor
Communists engaged in a spectacu
lar revolution with the only two
cruisers in the Peruvian navy to
day, but £>wr shots from a subma
rine were all that was necessary to
bring down the red flag and run up
the white.
The whole revolution occurred in
the port of Callao, near Lima, and
the residents of that town gathered
at the docks to watch the battle
from the air and much maneuver
ing which also included a little
bombing of naval craft.
