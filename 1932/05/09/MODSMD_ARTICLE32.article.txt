# OUT OR IN, WHICH SHALL IT BE?

One h;is but lo notice the predominance of two-toned
shoes, flannel trousers, and clean, while shirts on the Quad
this quarter to realize that 1 lie rei 4411 of the rough at Stan
ford is waning. Sartorial fastidiousness has invaded his
stronghold, put him who once was the pride of the Farm
definitely on the defensive.
His loss of prestige has been gradual, falling hit by bit
along tiie wayside during the past college generation. So
gradual, perhaps, that it has continued almost unnoticed.
Not until recently has an issue arisen which must bring the
battle out into the open, an issue upon which the very
existence of the rough is based.
That is his right to "crash" campus dances. It has been
denied, thwarted, crushed, and ignored throughout the
present school year. The complete exclusion of the roughs
Friday night at Tovon's sport dance was a startling ex
ample of the point to which the disrespect for this tradi
tional right lias progressed.
I here are two points of view. Though they may usually
be the veriest of roughs themselves, men who have paid
their fines to dance with the women they escort, are
distinctly against throwing wide the doors. On the other
hand, if they are looking at the question from outside the
door of a campus dance at the midnight hour of a night
when they didn't happen to have the price of a date, those
same men are indignant at the violation of their inherited
"right."
The issue is clearly defined. Those who are more often
out than in must light it out with those who are more
often in than out. The Daily cannot decide the ethical
point in question, but it can remind that if the latter win,
the very name of the Stanford rough is destined to pass
into the limbo of forgotten traditions.
