# THE
						HUSKY IN A BAD WAY
## 
### 
A.S.S.I', and Hoard ot Athletic Control oflicials licrc
have had a good deal to worry about financially in the past
year or two, what with decreased gate receipts and (Concert
Series deficits. There lias been considerable soft moaning
emanating from official (juarters. Hut for real grief the
local moguls should pay a visit to Washington I'niversity.
I p at the Husky institution the associated students are
iu the financial soup up to their ears. Forced to declare an
interest moratorium on a huge amount of outstanding
bonds, they have recently had to resort to a .%")(),()()() loan
to keep going. To obtain this emergency relief it was nec
essary to incorporate the campus bookstore, the only
tangible asset.
As a result of this straitened situation student body
chiefs have been beset by predatory bill collectors, have
had to cut salaries right and left, and have left minor ath
letic teams out in tile cold. Kven the Stanford lr«i%k meet
was cancelled, while the baseball squad has been nearly
reduced to hitch-hiking in making its road trips.
Contemplation of this moving spectacle should provide
at least a certain measure of satisfaction for the worried
Farm administrators. Washington is so much farther
down the depression cur ve than Stanford that by contrast
the Cardinal is on top of a prosperity wave.
