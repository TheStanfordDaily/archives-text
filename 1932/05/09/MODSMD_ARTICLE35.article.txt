# BULL SESSION
## SOMEBODY'S HUSBAND 
### 
The most startling bit of news to
come out of Hollywood and Reno in
many a month is the separation of
Ann Harding and her husband. Di
vorces in themselves can hardly be
classified as hot news in the Film
Capital of America. In that golden
spot four and five timers run rum
pant while a person with only one
divorce must needs feel decidedly
self-conscious. The rumor that a
group of movie actresses h-.id hired
the "Garden Room" of the Biltmore
in which to stage a grand reunion
with their past husbands has not
materialized. Too many of the girls
didn't like a crowded dance floor.
But Ann Harding was something
different. She was thought to be di
vorce-proof. The reported cause for
her divorce is novel—if nothing else.
It seems she has a husband; she
would have to have, I suppose, in
order to get a divorce. The spouse
is also a movie actor—or was—until
Ann became a star with the bril
liancy of a sun. The public began
to consider Bannister— that's the
husband's name—as merely an ap
pendage to the Harding name. And
finally as an unnecessary append
age. He was forgotten in the greater
lustre of his wife's glory.
Can we blame the poor man for
wanting a divorce? Imagine his tor
ture. Every place he went—it was,

| "there goes Ann Harding and her
| husband." "Who is that walking be
l side Ann Harding?" It was her hus
! band. It was Ann Harding's hus
band sitting in the corner of his
j club. His own personality became
, a nothing. He probably forgot, the
j sound of his own name. At the
I studios it was as "her husband"
j that he applied for a position.
i The world is based on the pre
' mise of the dominant male. That
i may be a wrong premise but it is
lan accepted one. That is why a
j woman can with comfort bask her
i self in the reflected warmth of her
i husband's lustre. The reverse does
not hold true. The husband that at
tempts to live in reflected light is
| not warmed. He is scorched—burnt
' to an unpleasant crisp to the titter
| ings and gitterings of the populace.
i A contemporary writer calls col
leges "Spinster Factories" and sta
i tistics proved that co-eds marry
; less (that is less co-eds marry) than
non-college women. The reason is
simple. A good percentage of uni
versity women want careers; and
, get them. Yet practically all men
| want a wife—not a lawyer, or a
doctor, or an interior decorator.
| The male wants nothing around the
domicile to challenge his self-ad
i mitted superiority. He doesn't want
I to be somebody's husband.
