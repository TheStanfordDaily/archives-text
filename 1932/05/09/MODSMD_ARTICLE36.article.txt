BEAUTY AND THE BOSS—At the
Varsity Theatre.
"Beauty and the Boss" is the film
version of "The Church Mouse"
which Colleen Moore played so ably
in San Francisco recently. Marian
Marsh is an extremely poor substi
tute for Colleen, but the text has
hardly been changed at all except
for the better and the other charac
ters are very well cast. Warren Wil
liam makes a fine banker, efficient
in banking hours but a devil with
the women out of them. Charles
Butterworth, as usual, provides the
comic element with customary abil
ity.
The plot is th.it of almost any
Viennese musical comedy without,
the music. The poor little girl gets
a job with the big bad banker and
finally wins his love by emerging
from her Cinderella existence and
appearing as an attractive young
lady. The only fault the producers
made was not taking proper advan
tage of a first-rate double-barreled
beard. Shorts—far better than aver

age. S.C.A.
"SKY BRIDE"—At the Stanford
Theatre.
Consisting mainly of numerous
shots of Jack Oakie's all-too-in
genius grin, and fancy air shots of
Richard Arlen's double, "Sky Bride"
is just another air film.
The plot is flimsy: Arlen's plane
crashes with that of a buddy, and
he can't get over it, so goes away.
Oakie, the true pal, goes after him
to help him '"fight this thing." Fi
nally the opportunity comes for Ar
len to save the grandson of his
buddy's mother, and he flies again,
and all is well. There is a girl, of
course.
Where the film is not too sugary
sentimental (there are a few places),
it is pretty good, although lacking
in the suspense that one expects of
air films.
Arlen's performance is good, and
he does net over-act, as he might
have. Jack Oakie is—well, just Jack
Oakie. —E.C.
