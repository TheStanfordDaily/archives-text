The Editor, Sir:
Probably you will be flooded with
protests against the attitude of Mr.
MellinkofT, expressed in your col
umns, concerning the Mussie case
in Honolulu. If you are then you
may cast this one into the scrap
basket, but one can scarcely refrain
from replying to such a regretttable
approach to the subject as that ex
pressed by Mr. Mellinkoff.
The unfortunate part of Governor
Judd's action is that he did not par
dort the four defendants convicted
of manslaughter, instead of making
a travesty of the laws of the land
by imposing a ten-year sentence
and then commuting it within an
hour.
The fact that Lieutenant Massie
gave the law every opportunity to
administer justice and that it was
not until it was obvious that justice

was not going to be administered
that he acted, is greatly to his
credit. When the wheels of justice
become so clogged with race pre
judices and political intrigues and
ambitions that they fail to rotate,
then they must be oiled, even
though it becomes necessary to re
sort to the idealism of primitive
man. Lynching is always regret
table, and never should be necessary,
and would not have been resorted
to in this case had the law fulfilled
its obligations to the community
and to the individuals concerned.
We must not lose sight of the
hideousness of the crime committed
against a defenseless woman. It
matters not whether the woman
were white or black, nor whether
the attackers were black or white.
It was a crime of unspeakable hor
ror, and it was obvious that it was
to go unpunished. All of which Mr.
Mellinkoff seems not to consider. It
is to be hoped that Mr. Mellinkoff
will mature into a sen.se of appre
ciation of the finer things of life be
fore any woman undertakes to share
her life with his.
