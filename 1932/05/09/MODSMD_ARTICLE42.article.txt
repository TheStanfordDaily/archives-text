# The 						WINDJAMMER
## 
### 
Arabia .
! Dear - Friends—
Please please please no more wise j
j cracks about the speed with which ,
we seem to travel. We thought that !
iit was a well-known fact about
j Windjammers being the fastest I
| things under sails. What if it does j
; take most people two or three j
| months to even get inside of the
; Tibetan border? We're different— |
! that's why we're here. (Yes, Dor- '
I othy, we still love you and miss i
j you horribly.)
Now we've thought of an even
better beginning for this Ara-
I bian epistle: Dear Folks: Hav
ing fine time and wish you were (
here. Am sitting 011 one small
ice-cake trying to keep cool and
not getting along so well, thank
you. llow is Ed Boyles? How is
Dynamite Hewlett? How is the
Convalescent Home? Ilow is the j
bus driver? How are the win- 1
dow shades at the Pi Phi house? |
(That's fine!) llow are the Betas
and their emblematic fraternity
' game, Hide-and-Seek?
Now to get down to brass tacks i
i (although that's rather difficult here, j
j since they're still in Ihe ago of
I wooden pegs), Arabia is a fine \
' country. That is to say, sand IS fine,
j isn't it?
We have looked carefully in every
! water hole, hoping to catch us a
whirling dervish. But the race seems
| to be extinct. Maybe there never
: were any such creatures. Maybe the
' guy was right when he said that a
i whirling dervish was a gambling
j machine used in the Casino at
Monte Carlo. We'll find out when
! and if we get that far.

These here now Shicks of
Araby that people (alk so much
about are complete washouts.
Might be better if they'd wash
up. Maybe not. We'll leave that
for you to decide sometime
when you have a moment to
drop over tins way.
We're right in style here, though,
having brought along all the ex
cords that were too dirty to be
cleaned or even thought about any
more. Open Sesame to any harem
in the country, we are assured (or
do they have harems in Arabia?).
Meanwhile, we have an im
portant financial project on foot.
For some years our old pal. Mr.
Donaldinc Hardy, who is a big
whip on the Daily stall, lias
urged us to start an interna
tional campaign for the installa
tion of bigger and better horses
in the Philippines, on account
of one of the little native runts
kicked him once, or something.
So here we aro, in the land oJ
fine old Arabian horses, the same
kind Adam rode when he left Para
dise for a warmer climate—just
hundreds and hundreds of then
waiting to be sent over among tin
tobacco juices, and we haven't Iht
proper A.S.S.U. permit to do any
thing about it. Maybe someone couk
take it up with the Ex Committee
i Huh! —W.
