IT SEEMS THAT about every
time two of the three "big shots"
get together for a California in
tercollegiate contest of one sort
or another there is a squawk or
two in tiie beaten team's paper,
tiie victor sarcastically growls
"sour grapes," and the general
feeling is none the better for
the encounter.

FOR EXAMPLE, in the Califor
nia-Stanford meet two distance
runners were battling for second
place. Runner A, on the outside,
runner B what looked to the
innocent bystander like a full
fledged shove. Runner B was heaved
onto the infield, and although he
regained the track in a stride, it
visibly affected him. Runner A's
coach immediately entered a pro
test against B, until one of As
teammates slipped him the infor
mation that it was A's lault. There
was no official on the corner, or at
least he did nothing, and that was
that.
The Trojan-Card fracas brought
up another gripe. There was much
excitement over the surveying that
went, on before they decided who
had won the javelin.
BUT ACCORDING TO a re
liable source, Williamson "crow
hopped" a good three inches on
that last throw which gave him
first place. There was no Stan
ford official on the event.
It is great copy to editorialize
about fraternal spirit this, and
schoolboy sportsmanship that, but
intercollegiate contests feature
teams that are in there to win. And
very often il is the slickest man
who wins rather than the best one.
If a man throws the javelin far
ther than his rival, but steps over a
little in doing it, he isn't going to
rush around looking for an official
who will nullify the throw. In fact
he wiil be pretty mad if there is
one who happens to see it. But no
one blames the competitor. It is up
to the university staging the meet
to provide officials, plenty of them,
and one from each of the two uni
versities if necessary.
.t
When it comes down to plain
chiseling in sports, most of the
universities are just about on a
par, and the only way to even
it oil' is to have the same num
ber of officials from each com
petitor. It isn't even enough to
get in so-called unbiased out
siders. If there is a more rabid
fan than the home-town fan, lie
has never been catalogued.
II is up to the students as far
as the question of letters for the I
rifle team goes.
So far no one has been able to i
ihink up a good reason for not !
nvarding them, and there is no one. j
A r ho knows anything about the j
eam's success this season, who i
loesn't want to see the awards I
landed out. And the best way to get j
hese awards to them is to get out I
aid VOTE May 24.
IF YOU LIKE SOCCER, watch j
he freshman-sophomore battle this f
ifternoon. It will give you an idea
if just how good future varsities
tre going to be. There are four po- ;
ential all-conference stars on the |
•econd-year team alone. And there j
ire a couple of varsity prospects on !
he yearling outfit. —Bob Wade. I
