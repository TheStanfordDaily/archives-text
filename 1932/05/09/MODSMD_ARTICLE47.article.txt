# Cards Cross Bats with Nippon Nine on May 20
## SKILLFUL FIELDING FEATURES PLAY OF RIKKYO UNIVERSITY Diamond Men Now Out For Football May Hinder Indian Chances 
### Bob Wade 
j Squeeze plays worked to perfec
tion, bases pilfered skillfully, and
' a barrage of bunts are in store for
i Farm fans when the visiting Uni
! versity of Rikkyo nine invades the
! sunken diamond for a game with
the varsity Friday, May 20.
Hailed as one of the smoothest
! working machines sent to the Uni-
I ted States in recent years, the visi
! tors are the champions of the Tokyo
: Big Six league. Stanford last had a
1 chance to see the baseball played
lin the colleges of the' Nipponese
i capitol when the Kwansai University
I team lost to the Indians 4-2 in the
! spring of 1930.
Left Japan in April
i The Japanese departed from the
' Land of the Rising Sun early in
! April, and are now in the East, after
| having played a number of contests
with the University of Washington
and Japanese nines around Puget
i Sound. They will return by way of
Los Angeles for the Card battle,
i Word from Jun Lshii, the "A. G.
Spaulding of Tokyo," gives the in
! vading outfit a flattering reputation.
1 They are described as better than
! any Japanese university team yet
| seen on the Pacific Coast, and prob
! ably better than those encountered
by the Stanford team of 1920 which
toured Japan under the auspices of
Waseda University.
Play Baseball in Fall
| The University of Rikkyo, also
| known as St. Paul's University, is
the only one in the Empire that is
run by Americans. The Japanese
j intercollegiate baseball season is
i played in the fall, and the winning
| team is usually given a trip to the
1 United States during the following
| spring.
With football practice keeping
j several of the varsity ball players
j away from the diamond, it is doubt
, ful if the Indians will present their
strongest lineup to the invaders.
Pitchers on Grid
j Caddel and Anderson are work
| ing out under Warner, which m t eans
i that the pitching corps will have to
j get the feel of the horsehide again,
j and Gordy Campbell is also cavort
ing under a Cardinal helmet, which
; will leave a hole in the outfield.
, Coach Wolter will probably have
; to borrow his two hurlers for the
j week in order to give the visitors
I some competition. The Japanese in
j vaders in the past have taken ad-
I vantage of Stanford errors to do
I most of their scoring, and lack of
i practice will necessarily hurt the
j Indians' chances, even though most
Jof the varsity are still out three
I times a week. .
