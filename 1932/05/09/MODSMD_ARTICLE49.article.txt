### 
Choosing as the subject for his
sermon in Memorial Church yes-1
terday morning, "The Source of
Spiritual Power, ' the Reverand
Archibald Sinclaid, minister of the
First Presbyterian Church of Bloom
field, New Jersey, defined spiritual
power as the courage and the will
ingness to see life through.
The source of the power, Dr. Sin- !
clair said, is largely in prayer. I
"Prayer," he said, "is at a low ebb, |
even within the church. We are liv- I
ing in an age of force and energy,
we like to see things done. Prayer
cannot bring us things, it can only
give use the courage to face life and
the things which it already holds."
