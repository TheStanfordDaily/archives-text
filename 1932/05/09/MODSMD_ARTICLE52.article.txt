# FIRST STRING BACKS BATTER SUB ELEVEN
## Caddel, Campbell, Maentz, Hillman Look Good 
### 
' i Things looked a bit rosier on the
i football field last Friday afternoon
lat the completion of the regular
. j practice session, probably the best
i j of the spring workouts to date.
Pop Warner had been sending his
j number one squad against the third
! group, using the first stringers on
j the offensive, and for the first time
, ! this season the men were clicking
| as they should.
Against a line that was playing
fine defensive ball, big Ernie Cad
del, Gordy Campbell, Bobby Maentz
I and impressive Jack Hillman were
j turning in many long gains. On
I several occasions, members of this
i quartet would tote the ball across
| the goal line some 45 yards away
j from the place where most of the
; i plays started.
j Bill Blanchard was the thorn in
j the side of the first-string backfield.
| From his position at center on the
| defensive team, he constantly broke
through to haul down the ball
carrier behind the line, and he
diagnosed the plays with uncanny
accuracy. With Milligan, Bates, and
| Albertson returning at center from
last year's team, the addition of
i Blanchard fortifies this position.
| The first team lined up with
Buchanan and Tod, ends, Pala
mountain and Lettunich, tackles,
Kite and Corbus, guards, Albertson,
i center, Campbell, quartex-, Caddel
and Maentz, halfbacks, and Hillman,

On the third team were Gillespie
and Holt, ends, Rogers and Hol
werda, tackles, Semmelroth and
, Card, guards, Blanchard, center,
. Walker, quarterback, Mallutratt and
| Spencer, halves, and Hancock, full.
