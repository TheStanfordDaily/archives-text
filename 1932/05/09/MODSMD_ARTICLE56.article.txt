Vying for the League III hard
ball championship, the ball clubs
from the Phi Kap and Alpha Kappa
Lambda houses clash in the decid-
ing game series of the intramural
diamond season on the frosh ball
diamond this afternoon. In what
may prove to be a pre-title fracas
for League IV teams, the Phi Sigs
meet the Japanese Club in the sec-
ond of the final round games for
the day.
With two wins and no losses, the
| league-leading Phi Kaps of Num
ber III division will attempt to pro-
tect their top position from the on-
slaught of the second-place A.K.L.'s.
A victory for the Phi Kaps would
mean a league championship. Should
the men from Alpha Kappa Lambda
pound out a win, their house would
move into a first-place tie with the
Phi Kaps, and a play-off would be
in order.
The result of the Phi Sig-Japa-
nese Club game will have less
I bearing on the final leagues stand
ing than will the Phi Kap-A.K.L.
| game. If the Phi Sigs, now in a sec
ond-place tie with El Campo in
League IV, should triumph, the
team from up the Row will move
| into an undisputed runner-up posi
tion behind the ranking Alpha Delts.
Re-opening the delayed indoor
ball schedule, the Business School
plays the Yliad nine, the ball club
from the Stanford Daily, while the
Phi Delta Phi team clashes with the
Education School in the day's soft
ball games.
