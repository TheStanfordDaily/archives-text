# FROSH-SOPH BATTLE WILL OPEN SOCCER INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
Opening the annual interclass
i soccer tournament ,the sophomores
take on the first-year men this af
j ternoon in what should be one of
I the outstanding battles of the com
-1 petition.
j Led by Captain Carl Knecht at
outside left, the sophomores pre
sent four men in their lineup who
will probably be members of the
1932 varsity. Alex Spoehr at right
half, Art Hearn at center forward,
Cy Johnson at inside right, and
Knecht make up a combination that
will have a strong scoring punch as
well as seasoned defense perform
ance.
Although lacking the brilliance of
the second-year men, the yearlings
have played together as a team
more than the other three squads,
and should present an airtight de
fense.
