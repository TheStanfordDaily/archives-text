Lou Reichers of Arlington, N. J., who will attempt a two-stop flight
to Paris in May, tested his plane in a flight from Montreal to Havana.
The flight is approximately the distance he will fly over water between
Newfoundland and Ireland, the two refueling stops he plans to make
on his flight from Newark, N. J., to Paris.
