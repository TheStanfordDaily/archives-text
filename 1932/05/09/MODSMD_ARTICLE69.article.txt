# DIES IN RUM BRAWL
## 
### 
ESCALON, M;iy 8. (/P) â€”Philip S.
Hill was beaten over tTie head with
a hammer and stabbed to death
early this morning in a drunken
brawl at his home on the ranch.
At Oregon U. the ping pong
tables are so popular that guys
in training for the marathon hire
out as hall-chasers and get swell
workouts.
