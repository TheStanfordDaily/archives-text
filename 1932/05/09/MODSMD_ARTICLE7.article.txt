# MASSIES, DARROW ON WAY TO CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
HONOLULU, May 8. (TP) â€” Mrs. i
Thomas H. Massie sailed today for '
San Francisco, after evading the
efforts of process servers to keep
her in Hawaii for a retrial of the I
four natives, accused of the attack j
upon her. With Mrs. Massie were j
her mother, Mrs. Granville Fortes- '
cue, and her husband, Lieutenant
Massie, who were granted pardons J
for the slaying of Joe Kahahawai. j
Clarence Darrow, the Chicago
lawyer who defended Massie and j
the three others, left Hawaii also, 1
with no rancor for the courts which I
convicted his clients, but with bit- |
ter condemnation for the "bunk and i
piffle" of law books. A strong guard i
of police, just as a precautionary
measure, protected the party.
