# CAMPUS THEFTS TRACED TO PAIR NABBED AT U.C.
## Robbers Gain Confidence Of Encina Resident, Burglarize Room 
### 
James Strong, 25, barber from
! Detroit, and Cecil Smith, 23, sales-
I man from Wolf City, Texas, are
I being held in the Berkeley jail to
j day after confessing to a string of
1 burglaries on the Stanford and
j California campi.
The men were apprehended by
! Berkeley authorities early yesterday
j morning while attempting to steal
the tires off a car parked in front
j of the International House. It was
| revealed that the pair had talked
their way into the Sigma Nu house
on Saturday afternoon, saying that
they were fraternity brothers.
Three Tires Stolen
Beginning their operations on the
Stanford campus last Wednesday
night as the Convalescent Drive
j jolly-up was in progress, the men
j stole a tire and wheel from a Palo
! Alto resident whose car was parked
j near the Pavilion. The same night
! they stole two tires and wheels from
the car of Margaret Murphy, senior
student, who had left her car in
front of Roble Hall.
Vincent Philippi, '32, unwittingly
j aided the burglars this same night
i when he gave the men access to
| his room in Encina after making
their acquaintance a short time be
| fore at the jolly-up. Claiming to
! know a friend of Philippi's in Mich
; igan, the men soon gained Philippi's
| friendship. Friday night they came
j back and looted the room of a
| leather jacket, a fountain pen, and
numerous personal articles belong
ing to Philippi and his roommate,
Baird Kidwell, '32. All these articles
were found in the burglars' pos
session when they were nabbed in
j Berkeley.
Professor's Car Stripped
Besides these thefts on Friday
j night the pair stole two tires and
| wheels from the car of K. F. Rein
hart, associate professor in Gcr-
I man. The robbery took place early
I in the evening while Reinhart's car
was parked in front of the Library.
With the apprehension of these
j two men, Campus Officers Gordon
Davis and George Burns believe
j they are well on their way toward
; solving a string of daring burglaries
| that have occurred on the campus
jin recent, months. Evanston (111.)
police are holding a suspect whom
i local officers think may be the man
j who looted five fraternity houses
l here of $150 on April 9.
Hunt Suspect
Peninsula police are also on the
| trail of Ralph Emory of Los An
geles who was known to be in this
j vicinity at the time of the fraternity
j thefts last month. Emory was iden-
I tified in Berkeley the day following
the Stanford robberies, but escaped
! before police could be called.
Emory has been jailed before on
charges of petty theft. Campus of
i fleers believe Emory responsible for
| the campus burglaries.
