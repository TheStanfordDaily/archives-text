# TARDIEU LOSES RULE TO REDS, RESIGNS OFFICE
## Le
						Brun Seen As Probable Successor To Slain Paul Doumer 
### 
PARIS, May 9. (A 3 )— As soon as a
new President has been elected to
morrow to succeed the assassinated
Paul Doumer, Premier Andre Tar
dieu will present the resignation of
his government with a request that
it be accepted immediately.
This step, somewhat unusual in
French parliamentary history, was
decided on by the Cabinet today as
a result of the decisive defeat suf
fered by the Tardieu Conservative
government in the Chamber of
Deputies elections Sunday.
Control of the new Chamber rests
with the Radical Socialists and the
Socialists, with former Premier
Edouard Herriot the most likely
successor to the premiership.
Arms Cut Foreseen
Now that the Chamber of Depu
ties is in the hands of the left par
ties, some observers look for a more
conciliatory policy in the problems
of disarmament and war debts and
reparations.
Apparently M. Tardieu decided to
step down immediately, instead of
waiting for the new Chamber to
convene in June, because he did not
wish to head a repudiated govern
ment at a time when France must
prepare for the important repara
tions conference at Lausanne in
June and must carry on at the dis
armament conference now being
held at Geneva.
Painlcve Quits Race
The Havas (French) News Agency
tonight reported that Paul Pain
leve, former Premier, had with
drawn as a candidate for the presi
dency. This left Albert Le Brun,
President of the Senate, alone in the
field.
