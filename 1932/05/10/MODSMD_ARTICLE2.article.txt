A curious third-dimension effect;
obtained by W. A. Griffith in a :
•oup of paintings now being shown j
the Stanford Art Gallery. Griffith j
ies sunlight and shadows, and per
icctive to good effect in obtaining |
lis quality.
In one painting especially "Dry j
astures," is this effect shown. The
one depicts cattle grazing beneath I
tree, and in the foreground are I
■me standing at a trough.
By the use of sunlight on the !
aves and glinting on the backs of j
e cattle, and the size of cattle :
ing beneath the tree at a distance, 1
c artist makes the tree fairly
and out from the background of
hill.
The exhibition of Griffith's paint
gs will remain on the walls until
ay 29.
