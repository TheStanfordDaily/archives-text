# Senate Unites To Speed New Budget Plans
## Borah Champions Hoover's Demand To Keep Tax Measure Intact 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 9. (A 3 ) â€”A 1
nonpartisan drive to speed the vital j
budget balancing program through !
the Senate gathered force today be- j
hind the tax and economy meas- >
ures.
The billion dollar revenue raising s
bill was submitted by the Finance !
Committee with overwhelming ap- j
proval. The compromise tax sched- |
ules were retained intact. Debate I
will begin Thursday.
From a whirl of debate and meet- j
ings on economy came a proposal i
from Senator Robinson of Arkan- |
sas, the Democratic leader, for ap- 1
pointment ot a special economy
committee.
Hoover Keeps in Touch i
Senator Watson of Indiana, the j
majority pilot, promptly accepted j
the suggestion.
President Hoover, who called in j
Republican leaders over the week- j
end to emphasize the taxes-economy j
program, kept contact during the!
day with the Senate situation. Sec
retary Mills called at the Senate to j
offer full co-operation in the cam- j
paign.
Senator Borah called for an end j
of controversy and recrimination *
over the economy issue in a state- i
ment off the floor.
'"Not One VVlioop"
In debate he warned that most of I
tlie cuts in appropriations made so j
far merely amounted to postpone- j
ments.
"I do not care one whoop," he j
said, "who gets the honor, who gets I
the glory, whether the executive,
the legislative, the Republicans or
Democrats, or both. Just so the
country gets economy. This contro
versy and crimination and recrim
ination is concealing the fact that
no economy bill is going to be
passed unless we change our atti
tude and discuss economy instead
of one another."
