# AKRON FLASHES S.O.S. TO TEXAS IN STORM PERIL
## Airship Commander Radios Town To Stand By For Assistance ASKS LANDING CREW Dirigible Turns Back To San Angelo 
### 
In danger from severe electrical
storms sweeping over central and
western Texas, the Navy dirigible
Akron halted temporarily last night
on her trip to the Pacific Coast, ac
cording to Associated Press des
patches.
The giant ship signalled to San
Angelo airport and called for a
landing crew of 500 men. If neces
sary, asked the airship in flash-light
signals to operators on the ground,
the city's entire population would
be called into service to land the
dirigible. This was at 11:20 p.m.,
Central Standard Time (10:20 Pa
cific Time).
The giant ship met electrical dis
turbances and storms between San
Antonio and San Angelo. More were
in prospect west of San Angelo. The
Akron first passed over San Angelo
at 10:30 (8:30 Pacific Time), Hying
low on a western course. A snort
time later she doubled back, as fly
ing conditions proved to be too bad
for Commander C. E. Rosendahl to
pilot the giant ship through.
Thunderstorms were reported
virtually everywhere in western
Texas and New Mexico. Violent
electrical storms were reported west
of San Angelo on the ship's route
to the Pacific Coast.
After a thousand San Angelo citi
zens had massed at the city airport
to assist in landing the dirigible
Akron, the huge ship turned and
floated away. She is expected to be
over Houston at 6 o'clock, Central
Standard Time.
