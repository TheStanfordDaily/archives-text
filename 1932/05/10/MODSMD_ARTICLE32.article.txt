# HOW ABOUT A COURSE IN COMMON SENSE?
## 
### 
Two burglars duped, tricked, swindled, and laughed at
a couple of seniors on this campus last week. Becoming
acquainted with the students at the all-University jolly-up,
the two smooth "operators" put up a convincing story of
being visiting college men from another state.
The seniors swallowed the bail whole, lasting only the
sugar coating without bothering to bile into the bitter cen
ter, and as a result were minus a jacket and a couple of
fountain pens when the crooks left after enjoying a pleas
ant evening of Stanford hospitality. One of them was even
left alone to sleep for a couple of hours in the room of the
sociable students.
1 he thieves, .lames Strong, a barber from Detroit, and
Cecil Keith, salesman from Texas, during their brief stay
here as guests succeeded also in stealing several auto tires
from cars parked on the campus. Friday evening they at
lended the Tovon sports dance, enjoyed themselves
thoroughly, and left il several more articles to the good.
At California Sunday night, after parking their trunks
in a fraternity house where they had been accepted as visit
ing brothers, they were finally caught, by Berkeley police,
in the act of stealing another lire.
And students who never lock fraternity house doors,
leave valuable articles in parked cars, and even tumble for
hoaxes of the above variety are puzzled bv the epidemic
of theft that has deeended upon the Farm during the pres
ent school year!
The efficiency of Stanford's police cannot be questioned.
On the contrary, had not the unceasing efforts of Fred
* .v
Frche and (leorge Burns been present to check the rising
rale of theft, the campus itself might very well have been
stolen while .'>.">(lo students watched what they thought to
be reconsli action operations.

It is difficult to understand how university men at an
institution that is supposed to harbor only Ihe intelligensia
can be so gullible, naive, and utterly helpless when it comes
to dealing with one of the first facts in Ihe primer of life.
