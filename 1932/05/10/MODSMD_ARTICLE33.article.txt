# PUT IT TO A VOTE
## 
### 
Hv fin* Ihe sanest, safest, ami most promising suggestion
yet made to settle the Prohibition question is the recent
proposal of a general referendum, to be effected by sub
mitting to the stales a measure rescinding the eighteenth
amendment. This is, of course, 1 lie only legal way to ac
complish any revision of the present law, but it is also the
best way to decide definitely the feeling of the country on
the matter.
Although the election of a preponderantly wet Congress
would probably demonstrate a wet majority, the many
other issues which confuse Congressional campaigns make
such an election next to impossible. The present dry domi
nance in Washington is not conclusive, because it is largely
hereditary from Ihe early days of Prohibition, and no one
can be sure whether il is their dry stand or some other fae
lor that keeps the solons in ollice.
A vote on an amendment would exclude all other issues.
There could be no uncertainty as to the will of the people.
Furthermore, since no political struggle for posts would be
involved, the vote should be taken without an undue
amount of hullabaloo.
The whole thing hinges upon the willingness of the drys
to permit a referendum. They are in power by a decisive
majority. II tlicy refuse to heed the widespread demand
for a final lest of opinion lliev can prevent Congress from
proposing the measure to the slates.
Hut il is significant lo note that the agitation for a vote
is not coming solely from wet leaders. The San Francisco
C.hronicle, which now luis Chester Howell, an ardent sup
porter of Prohibition, as one of its editors, has come out in
favor of Ihe idea. So has George W. Wickersham, head of
President Hoover's famous Law enforcement Commission.
If Ihe chiefs of Ihe Senate and House are of big enough
caliber to put the interests of the nation above their own
personal prejudices, il they are sufficiently intelligent to see
the logic of the proposal, if Ihe growing evidences of anti-
Prohibition sentiment calm their fears of dry wrath, then
we may see some rc;il action to remedy the untenable
belwi\t-and-betwecn situation in which the t'nited States
now finds itself.
If all of you lnird-working and intelligent journalists
who work on The Daii v will drop into the office at 1:1.1
o'clock this afternoon, Ihe hicks from the inner shrine will
attempt lo gladden your hearts with a few complimentary
remarks.
