# BULL SESSION
## GIBBERING GENEVA 
### 
In that customarily rocky and |
barren region variously known as j
the common mind —the general in
tellect—or the public semi-con
sciousness, there often springs up
a popular type of vegetation. It
blooms forth in attention-compel
ling colors—completely dominates
the landscape for a while—and then j
perishes into the dust from which '
it sprang. Thus once it was the
"Red Menace"—later "Hoover Com- i
missions"—and at various times |
"Conferences" that hogged the spot
light, the footlights, and every other ;
sort of stage illumination.
It is very evident that "Confer- I
ences" are in the descendency at 1
the present. Thus it is that the pres- i
ent Geneva Disarmament Confer- j
once is slowly fading completely |
from the common consciousness— |
and when one stops to consider the j
Geneva business—maybe it is with |
some justification that we are for- j
getting Geneva and all of its of- :
ficial gibberings. Hopefuls, like my- I
self, thought that the present de- '
pression would have acted like a j
biting lash beating the nations to a j
speedy dash down the disarmament j
path.
But that was ill-founded hope. |
The nations are hugging to the [
starting line with untold persist- 1
ency. If they ever leave their start
ing holes, it will be a wonder; and
only by herculean effort will they
be pushed, dragged, and forced to I
progress a few yards. The most •
agonizing part is the playing back
and forth of the various nations
with consummate ease—consum- '

mate affront—and perfect insincer
ity.
Italy—that is Mussolini — fairly
hugs the Dove of Peace to death
with loving affection when he issues
the statement that he will cut his
army to 10,000 should others cut
similarly. Well, he knows that
France can't and won't do this. Yet
such a piece of meaningless bunk
drapes the blood and thunder ruler
of Italy in spotless white and shin
ing" peace. Gestures cost nothing and
Mussolini is not adverse to banter
ing them about liberally.
But France will not be outdone.
The Tricolor favors world disarma
ment with an international army.
The sons of France will form the
first contingent. Such a patriotic
move! This is an impossible pro
posal and France above everybody
else realizes its impossibility. The
U.S. is not even a member of the
fairly harmless League. Even to
think of our participation in this
army is base hypocrisy—loo per
cent unadulterated.
And behind all this bunk stands
the laughing Russian Bear with a
plea for immediate total disarma
ment. No one can tell if the Soviets
mean it because no one can afford
to call her hand. Meanwhile Russia
can sit pat—the apostle of peace—
the thorn in the well-rounded bel
lies of the other nations.
And through it all the possibility
of lifting an intolerable burden from
off the backs of sweating taxpayers
everywhere becomes less and less
possible. —Abe Mellinkoff
