POOR MELLINKOFF I

! The Editor, Sir:
} Certainly every true Stanford j
student must heartily endorse the
opinion expressed by Miss Helen
Masters Bunting, Associate Profes- |
sor of Physical Education for !
Women, in yesterday's Daily. It is i
indeed unfortunate that Mr. Mellin- 1
{ koff should have attempted to re- ,
i fute the right of the Navy to make '
j the preservation of law and order ]
I incidental to the protection of the ,
I honor of a poor, defenseless, intoxi- j
cated woman, clad only in an eve- |
i ning gown, wandering about in de- I
I serted, unlighted streets at 2 o'clock (
lin the morning.
It would appear to be elaborating
upon the obvious to point out that i
no stauncher defenders of a woman's j
honor could be found than our own
Navy men. In fact, if any one thing
is characteristic of our Navy per
! sonnel, it is its unswerving loyalty •
Ito the sacredness of virtuous '
womanhood. Certainly the courage
| ous action of Lieutenant Massie was j
; based in part at least upon his
knowledge that the Navy in Hawaii
never fails to support enlightened
terrorism and sanctified murder.
It seems, therefore, altogether fit
ting and proper that Stanford stu- |
express their thorough and whole
hearted appreciation of the ''finer:
things of life" through the medium i
of a petition to be circulated which
would unreservedly endorse the 1
policy adopted by the Navy, sane- !
j tioned by Hearst, and approved by j
| Miss Helen Masters Bunting, name- j
i ly: the extermination of all those j
! wretches, particularly Hawaiian, i
: who might be suspected of molest- i
j ing crystal pure womanhood. And I
! to make the endorsement more em- :
[ phatic, Stanford women should be j

| called upon to boycott the marital
i ambitions of the monstrous Mr.
I Mellinkoff and thus force him to
' retract his damnable support of
! justice through law and order in
I favor of the only real way of
! achieving true justice, the "ideal
j ism of primitive man."
