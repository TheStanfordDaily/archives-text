# MORE ON MASSIE

### 
j The Editor, Sir:
After reading the condemnation
! of Abe Mellinkoff's fine attitude on
! law enforcement in the Massie mur
j der case by Helen Masters Bunting,
j associate professor of physical edu-
I cation for women, I wish to add a
word of praise to the "Bull Ses
sion."
Some think that because a mur
derer was found guilty the U.S.
Navy has been insulted. It is inter
: esting that the Lieutenant's wife re
fuses to testify in the new trial to
I convict the Hawaiian attackers.
| White women do not have to live
j in our conquered island possession.
Respectfully, Bissell Magee
