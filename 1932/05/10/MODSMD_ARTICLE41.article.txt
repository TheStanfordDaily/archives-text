# FRESHMEN BURY FRIEND Encinaites Become Playful SLEEPS WITH BILLIARDS
## 
### 
A dank and dismal trick was
played and carried out in the dark,
halls of Encina during the small
hours of Thursday night. When |
Morpheus clasped an unlucky rough !
in her embrace two villains tied
him securely to his bed.
Then they lifted the bed and its
occupant, carried it down ti long
flight of stairs to the third floor.
Three flights more they carried j
the seemingly lifeless corpse down !
to the lobby. Hefe the load was de
posited and the conspirators went j
into a heavy conference.
Suddenly a brilliant idea evolved
in the minds of the harassed fourth
floor roommates. Gingerly the bed
was lifted high in the air and de
posited aboard the billiard table. I
Here the four grouped around in j
reverential attitude, very much the ;
same as if holding a post mortem,
and then they left him strapped on :
his bed aboard the billiard table to j
spend the night in blissful sleep. |
