# Prepsters' Marks For Track Events Menace Card Best
## High School Champions Missing On Farm 
### —By A.J.G. — 
What is modern youth coming to?
High and mighty Stanford stu
dents, between watching Ben East
man crack world's records and War
ner's varsity swamp Eastern loot
hall teams, are wont to boast of the
enormous superiority of Indian ath
letes over the rest of the world
(U.S.C. temporarily excepted). A
careful study of the records of 1931
high - school track champions
prompted the Daily sports stalf to
make out another of its infallible
dope sheets of a mythical meet be
tween the three best prep athletes
in each event and the varsity track
team.
The prepsters would lose by
less than ten points!
Take Asley Burch of Jordan
High School, for instance. This
speed demon has covered 100
yards in 9.6 seconds and the 220
in 21.4. Even a member of Glen
dale lightweight track team has
broken even time in both
sprints.
And there's Johnny McCar
thy's 45.7 record in the 440.
That would stand up under the
challenges of a lot of college
champions. Or take Amsden
Oliver's mark of 23.5 for the
220-yard low hurdles. Then try
to imagine an imaginary liigh
jumping contest between Stan
ford and California leapers and
Jacques and Johnson, who both
went over (J feet, 4 inches in the
C.I.F. meet last year.
Even in Stanford's shot and dis
cus stronghold, (he prepsters would
probably earn a few points. Elwyn
Dees threw the 12-pound shot 60
feet, 5 inches on a practice throw,
while Petty of Kaufman, Texas,
tossed a regulation discus 154 feet,
G '/id inches.
But the real gripe about last
year's prep champions is that not a
dern one of them came to Stanford!
