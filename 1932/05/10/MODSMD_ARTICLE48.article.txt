# 'STAY WITH SHIP' SHOUTS DU BOIS; FIRE PERILS LAB
## 
### 
A combustion experiment
which ran wild threatened to
start a conflagration and gave
students in Dr. Robert Du Bois'
chemistry class a scare re
cently.
A mixture of magnesium and
silicon dioxide was being
heated in a large test-tube to
cause a reaction in which the
magnesium was to be oxidized
to its oxide with the liberation
of much heat when the com
bustion became more vigorous
than expected and a stream of
fire poured out of the tube
onto the table and floor.
Like the radio operator who
stays with his ship, Dr. Du
Bois kept the test tube ele
vated until most of the reac
tion was completed before
dropping it because of the in
tense heat.
