# PROBE TO SHOW MENTAL ABILITY OF SENIOR CLASS
## 
### 
The truth will out! Tomor
row's Daily will show the
bared souls of Stanford sen
iors. The tale that tells will be
based on a systematic ques
tionnaire distributed to mem
bers of the Class of '32, and
will show the real intelligence
and taste of those who have
seemed to pursue learning for
four years. The potent ques
tion that the results will show
simmers down to "Are the
seniors really intelligent, or
has four years of Stanford left
them as wet behind the ears
as when they first arrived
from Prune Center, Oregon?"
The questionnaire is a tricky
one, including everything from
movie actresses to favorite pro
fessors, as well as their opinions
on socialism, prohibition, and
the double standard. Some 200-
odd ballots, some odder than
others, but all pretty odd, will
tell whether a college educa
tion is worthwhile.
