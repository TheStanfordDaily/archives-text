FOOTBALL WON'T be such af
bad game next fall after all. When j
the august rules committee gath
ered at Hanover, New Hampshire, j
last February, the high moguls did j
a lot of tinkering, most of which I
was good but part of which was |
very bad indeed.
One new rule was designed to
prevent defensive linemen from
socking opponents on the head,
neck, or face, with a hand, wrist,
forearm, elbow, or other handy im
plement, All of which was very \
fine, but the rule was nullified by )
a penalty of disqualification.
When coaches all over the court
try pointed out that this was a too
stringent penalty which officials |
would hesitate to enforce, the rules !
committee did not hesitate to back
down from its former position, re- !
ducing the penalty to 15 yards and
making the rule workable.
NOW COMES another change,
one which is more important to
spectators than to players. Af
ter a mail vote, the committee
! has restored the kick-off to the
game. Originally (lie rule was
framed to allow the ball to he
put in play by a punt instead
of the conventional kick-off if
the kicking team so desired.
Obviously, everybody would
haVe punted, and the game
would have been robbed of one
{ of its greatest thrills.
The intention of the rule, of I
course, was to prevent the for
mation of the flying wedge, as
it was believed the longer and
higher travel of the punt would
give the kicking team more time
to get down under the ball. It
was found in spring practice all

'
' over the country, however, that j
the rule requiring five men on
the defensive team to remain on
their own 45-yard line until the
ball is kicked is ample to break
up the use of the wedge.

ONE MORE change, and the!
I juggling will be complete. One of I
the most unsatisfactory rules con- I
cocted by the committee is that j
making the ball dead when any part j
lof the ball-carrier's body, except I
his hands or feet, touches the!
; ground.
The aim is to prevent "piling up," j
but this could be limited by more j
specific legislation against kneeing i
! without making such a funda- j
mental change in the game.—L.M.C. j
