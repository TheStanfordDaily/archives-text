# BEAVER POLOISTS PERIL CARD TITLE IN POLO INVASION
## Oregon State To Bring Own Horses For Matches On May 19, 21 
### Bill Myers 
In what promises to be the fea- |
ture polo matches at the Farm this
spring, the Card poloists will clash ,
with Oregon State on May 19-21 in j
a two-game series.
According to dope from Corvallis, :
the Northern riders expect to
avenge defeats of the last two years '
by bringing down a crack outfit that j
they believe will trample the Red- j
shirts. The Oregon Staters will '
bring their own ponies along with
them, an innovation in intercolle- 1
giate polo on the coast. Heretofore i
the added expense entailed was not ;
considered worth the extra advan- j
tage of a team having its own j
mounts.
Cards Won Before
In last year's series the Cards
managed to nose out the Beavers
in both games, but only by a two
goal margin in each game. In these i
matches Oregon State was riding j
the Stanford mounts, which was |
something of a handicap.
The Oregon outfit claim they have j
p classier team than last year. But
just how they stack up with the |
Redshirts' team this year cannot be 1
doped out, since they have met no |
team that Stanford has.
Stanford Good
Even if the Beavers do have a i
completely revamped outfit, they j
• still will have to contend with aj
I Card quartet that is probably the
I flashiest bunch of riders ever seen
!at the Farm. Climaxing a brilliant
season, the Redshirts won the Coast
low-goal championship last month
at Beresford and are rated as one
of the outstanding college teams in
! the country.
There is still some anxiety over
Captain Bruce Fleming, who pulled
; a muscle in scrimmage two weeks
! ago. It is uncertain yet whether or
I not he will be able to play in time
for the Oregon State series. Flem
j ing plays at number four, the back
! position.
