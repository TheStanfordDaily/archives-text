(Editor's Note: This is the fifth of a series of articles on the Tenth
Olympic Games at Los Angeles.)

Although he will face five of the
greatest half-milers in Olympic
Games history in the finals of the
800-meter run, Ben Eastman ap- i
i i I
pears to be the most certain winner J
at Los Angeles this summer.
, Tom Hampson of England is likely ; :
to furnish Eastman's greatest com
petition, although Hamson's real
I task will be to tire out "Blazing
Ben" so that Lieutenant G. Ram
| pling, the great English quarter- 1
| miler, will have a good chance to
j nose out Eastman over 400 meters.
Not that Hampson, with a mark of j.
' 1:51.7 (just four-tenths of a second
j slower than Eastman's record time i
| for 880 yards) expects to travel all |
1 the way to Los Angeles just to be j
beat. D. G. A. Lowe won the 800- |
! meter championships in 1924 and J
i 1928, when he was conceded little
; more than outside chances.
French Runners
Sera Martin oÂ£ France holds the
world's record for 800 meters at
1:50.6, but his tendency to let down
a trifle under serious fire, and
charges of professionalism will
probably keep him from being a
! factor in the Tenth Olympiad. Rob
j ert Feger (1:53.2) and Paul Keller
(1:55.1) are real fighters, however,
while Jules Ladoumegue, who is as j
J great a runner as they come, could j
place in the 800, 1500. 5000, and I

10,000 meter faces against any com- 1
petition. Ladoumegue has been 11
charged with professionalism, how- 1
ever, and it is feared that his ama- |
teur days are over. Ladoumegue's j i
records are: 200 meters, 21.8; 400
meters, 48.9; 800 meters, 1:51.8; 1500,
3:49.2; 1 mile, 4:09.2; 5,000 meters, ,
14:38.
Tavernari, the Italian champion,
has done 1:52.2, while Danz (1:53.2),
Muller (1:54), and Engelhardt (3d
at Amsterdam), form a strong Ger- ;
j man team. Dr. Paul Martin of Swit
zerland, Bhylen of Sweden (2d at
I Amsterdam), and Otto Peltzer of
i Germany, 880-yard record-holder
until Ben Eastman came along, seem 1
to have lost a bit of their champion-i
ship speed. Johanneson and Strack j
of Norway have touched 1:55, a ;
mark which they will have to bet- j
ter to even get to the semi-finals, j
Canadian Hopes
Canada has two fine runners in !
Phil Edwards and Alex Wilson, both \
! American college men, and both I
j members of the Canadian team in j
11928. I
