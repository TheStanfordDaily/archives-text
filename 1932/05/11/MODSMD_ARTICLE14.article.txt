# SEWARD SHOWS ICEBERG SLIDES
## Noted Lecturer Discusses Greenland Summer 
### 
Illustrating his lecture on "A
Summer in Greenland" with re
markable photographic slides, Dr. A.
C. Seward, eminent botanical fossil
expert of Cambridge University,
spoke last night in the Little Thea
tre under the auspices of Sigma Xi
fraternity and the Public Exercises
Committee.
An entertaining speaker, Dr.
Seward gave an account of his 1921
trip to the northern country, empha
sizing the chief characteristics of
the ice-covered island.
Pictures of Eskimo and Danish
settlements, community life, ice
bergs, geological and geographical
features, vegetation, and fossil re
mains were included in the slides.
Dr. Seward described the histori
cal aspects of the country, and the
strange geographical features which
allow vegetation and settlement only
along the borders of the island,
where the deep ice has receded.
Many of the icebergs found in the
North Atlantic between England
and North America, he said, origi
nated from pieces broken oil the
tremendous glaciers of "the largest
island of the world."
Plant life in Greenland. Dr. Sew
ard described as minute. Fossil re
mains found there bear a strong
resemblance to vegetation now
growing in tropical countries. He
attributed this fact mote to the
changing power of plants to react
to temperature than to vital changes
in temperature, or movement of
continents. "We are prone to esti
mate the value of fossil plants as
thermometers of ihe ages," he said.
Dr. Seward will give three more
lectures at Stanford, today, tomor
row, and Friday nights at 7:30
o'clock in the Geology Building un
der the auspices of the Botany and
Geology departments. His general
subject for these talks will be
"Plant Life Through the Ages."
