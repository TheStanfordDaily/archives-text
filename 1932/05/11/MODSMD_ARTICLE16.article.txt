## Bob Jones, Discus Thrower, Favored To Score In Meet Saturday

Records, records, records.
Meet records, California records, j
Pacific Coast records, world s rec- I
ords. All kinds except scholastic j
and phonograph records are due for |
a smashing at the sixth annual West j
Coast Relay Carnival ut Fresno, i
Saturday.
No less than six world standards i
have fallen by the wayside under j
the combined barrage of Stanford, i
California, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., Fresno j
State, Olympic Club, and Los An
geles Athletic Club track forces, j
And although the Olympians and
Boyd Comstock's Los Angeles stars
have withdrawn from this year's j
meet, unofficial entries from these
clubs will again be in there doing
their share of record-breaking.
Not Full Team
Although Stanford officials have
decided against sending a full team |
to Fresno this year, fourteen men,
including one relay team, will ac- |
company Coach Bill Ellington to
the Raisin City.
The only potential record-break- |
ers who will be wearing Stanford i
colors are Bob Jones, discus-throw- !
er, Bill Miller, pole-vaulter, and I
Nelson Gray, shot-putter. Of these |
three, only Jones is favored to win
Saturday against the best Pacific j
Coast competition, but Miller and i
Gray have outside chances to win j
their favorite events. They will have '
to approach world records in order i
to win.
Great Pole Vault
Perhaps the greatest pole-vault
field in history will line up at the |
Fresno pits, including the great Lee 1
Barnes, who set a world's record in '
the 1928 Relay Carnival at 14 feet, j
1' 2 inches, will be there to battle :
Bill Graber, U.S.C. junior and :
holder of the intercollegiate title, j
Vern McDermott, N.C.A.A. cham- j
pion. Bud Deacon, a mediocre
jumper at Stanford last year who j
! developed into a record-threatener |
j under Southern California skies, |
J George, Poole, California's come- i
i through captain who jumps poorly j
i all year until the crucial meets |
1 come along, and last, and (accord- i
j ing to the dope), least, Stanford's j
three-man contingent: Bill Miller, I
: Bert DeGroot. and Ned Johns.
Nellie Gray
Nellie Gray's practice throw of j
I 51 feet, 2 inches would only place J
I him third against Herman Brix and |
j Harlow Rothert, who have both ex- i
ceeded 52 feet. However, Nellie j
1 seems to have acquired the knack I
|of former Stanford shot-putting i
i champions to throw the iron pellet !
, just a few inches more than they!
have ever done before, if such a |
| throw is necessary to win the event, j
; Here Laborde and Johnny Lyman j
ride with Jones and Gray as the
other two members of the Cardinal
clad "Four Horsemen." They haven't
conceded any first places yet.
j U.S.C.'s hurdle relay team will
| attempt to lower the American
j Olympic hurdler's time of 59.5 for \
I the 480-yard shuttle hurdle relay, j
|If Jeddy Welch runs 14.7 for his j
lap, Joe Bills 14.8. Jimmy Payne
j 14.8 for the third flight, A1 Vignola j
i or Bill Stokes will only have to turn j
j in a 15-second race to enable the
i Trojans to crack the 59.5 second |
j performance.
Harvard is said to have abolished !
I Yale locks from its dormitories. I
