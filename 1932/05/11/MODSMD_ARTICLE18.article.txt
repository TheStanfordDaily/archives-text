### 
CAN FRANCISCO. May 11. (/P) —Twelfth Naval District headquarters,
which was in touch with the Akron throughout Monday night's storm,
expects the airship to arrive over San Francisco about 2 or .'5 p.m.. today, j
She will anchor at Sunnyvale around 7 p.m.
EL PASO, Texas, May 10. (/P) —The naval dirigible Akron was sighted
from El Paso at (>:25 p.m. (Mountain Standard Time). It had Hot yet
reached the city.
DALLAS, Texas, May 10. (/P)—Storm clouds which had hung low over
the Guadalupe mountains lifted a little while before sunset today, and
the great naval drigible Akron headed westward again, seeking to nose

through the foggy barrier into El j
Paso.
At 7 p.m., Central time, she was j
approaching El Paso, plowing her j
way under the fog banks at fifty
five miles an hour, after having .
passed over the mountain range east j
of that city.

All during the day the air cruiser |
had followed a slow and circuitous j
course over the ranch lands of the i
Big Bend country. Radio communi- i

with army flying stations at El Paso j
and San Antonio.

proached the range. Visibility de
creased to zero and low clouds
forced the ship to reverse its course.
Constant calls for weather data j
were received by Texas radio sta- i
tions.
