PARIS, May 10. (TP) â€” France
gained a President today and lost a
Premier.
Albert Francois Lebrun, GO years
old, a mining engineer like President
Hoover, and the son of a farmer,
was elected President of the Repub
lic by an overwhelming majority of
the Senate and Chamber of Dep
uties meeting in joint session in the
historic Palace of Louis XIV at Ver
sailles.
On his way back to Paris M. Le
brun received the resignation of the
Ministry headed by Andre Tardieu.
At the request of the President M.
Tardieu said he would remain in of
fice on the understanding that a
new Cabinet would be formed by
June 4 at the latest. The new
Chamber of Deputies meets June 1.
Lebrun Takes Charge
As soon as the colorful election
ceremony was completed at Ver
sailles, Premier Tardieu turned over
the executive powers to the new
head of the state. Then M. Lebrun
hastened to Elysee Palace in Paris,
where he bowed before the bier of
Paul Doumer, his assassinated pre
decessor.
After expressing condolences to
Mme. Doumer, the new President
went to the tomb of the Unknown
Soldier at the Arc Do Troimphe,
where he placed a wreath.
New President Unopposed
There was virtually no opposition
in the joint Senate and Chamber
session to the brisk little man whose
service as President of the Senate
had put him in line for the most
highly prized gift of the French peo
ple.
M. Tardieu will carry on as Pre
mier just as he would if there had
been a Cabinet overthrown in Par
liament. Pending the selection of a
new government, he will take no
initiative in important matters of
state.
