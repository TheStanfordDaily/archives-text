Programs for the Encina
Club Spring Informal will
make their appearance on the
campus this afternoon after 4
o'clock, when they will be
given out in Room 221 Encina.
In keeping with the theme of
the ball, which is "Drama," two
masks representing Tragedy
and Comedy are stamped on
the front with a silver die, and
the dances instead of being ar
ranged according to numbers
are divided into acts and
scenes.
Bids must be presented by
those desiring programs and
for the benefit of those who
have not yet acquired theirs
the few remaining may be
bought in Room 221, the En
cina Barbrr Shop, or the
A S.S.U. office at $3 each.
