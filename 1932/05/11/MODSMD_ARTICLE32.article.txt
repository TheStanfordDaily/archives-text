# NO SMOKING ON THE QUAD
## 
### 
Many people think Hint observance of tradition will
stunt individuality and to carry on old customs is a sign
of dogmatism and a hinderance to progress. Hut the tradi
tions that linger about the Farm, lew though they are, are
not straight-jackets for the sole purpose of confining the
inhabitants but are merely courtesies that all should be
decent enough to observe.
In particular is the tradition of not smoking on the
Quad. This custom does not apply only to the inner court
but to the whole Quad, buildings, the walk along the out
side edge and all.
Mrs. Stanford asked dial all smokers forego this pleas
ure while on the Quad and, at least, out of consideration for
her wishes, this request should be obeyed. Also, from a
practical standpoint, it would keep the Quad from being
continually littered with matches and cigarette stubs.
Lately several students have been seen smoking within
the restricted limits. Perhaps their negligence is from
mere ignorance of the rule. More likely they are trying to
satisfy their childish ego by this flagrant disregard of the
local custom. They perhaps think that passing co-eds will
admire their bravery in daring to flout a ruling made in
accordance with the wishes of the founders, which gentle
men are courteous enough to obey.
This infantile, swaggering method of exhibiting bravado
is outgrown by most students by the time they leave prep
school. Those whose development was apparently stunted
along this line and still think it smart to show off by being
discourteous might be glad to know that they will be con
sidered just as rough and tough as the older students if
they step off the Quad before exhibiting their hardiness by
smoking so soon after escaping the proverbial apron
strings.
