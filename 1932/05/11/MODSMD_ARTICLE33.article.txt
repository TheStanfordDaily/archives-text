# VALLEY OF DEATH-ECONOMIC
## 
### 
Into Iho valley of death rode the six hundred!
Not soldiers, these, nor are they equipped with instru
ments of war. And they are not riding into the mouths of
n lot of old fashioned cannon, nor was Alfred Lord Tenny
son thinking, when he wrote these lines, of the men and
women to whom Stanford will soon hid goodbye with a
cript "Here's luck."
Mere students, they are, marching into the economic
valley of death armed only with degrees. Yet the crisis
they fact ivals that which confronted the British war
riors whom Tennyson immortalized, and they are prob
ably even further outnumbered l>v the enemy.
II is not just a stagnant business world that they must
attack, but a stagnant business world to which a reinforce;
mcnt of 2(>00 t'niversity of California graduates has been
added only a month previous. What chance has a Stanford
man against four-to-one Blue and Gold odds that already
have gained a live-week advantage on him?
