# THE 						DONS LOSE A WHITE HOPE
## 
### 
The Chicago While Son stirred up an unconscionable
amount of fuss and fury by signing lip the University of
San Francisco's white hope freshman pitcher, Lefty Feiber.
I'.S.F. officials and Hav Region sports writers have con
demned big leaguers as a w hole and the Son in particular
lor "robbing the cradle,'* snatching a boy of IK out ot col
lege with an offer of a fat contract.
On the face of il the outraged Dons, who might not have
been so outraged had Feiber been merely a promising
young scientist lured away by a big industrial firm, appear
to have something of a case. A little thought, however,
suggests that the action of the Chicago club may prove to
Feiber's advantage in the long run as well as at the mo
ment. College coaches to the contrary notwithstanding, it
is highly probable that he will learn a lot more baseball in
professional circles than in the California Intercollegiate
League. Lven if he doesn't make good immediately, he will
gain valuable eNperiencc.
And in regard to the main t'.S.F. talking point, that
Feiber will lose the benefits of a college education, con
siderable doubt exists ;is to the value of such an education
in his case. The alacrity with which he grasped the White
Sox offer indicates that the Don frosh was not going to
college with any very fixed ambition. It is not at all im
possible that college would be a waste of time for him; he
might be turned out as just another aimless graduate, glad
to take a job peddling gas in a service station. In baseball
he has a chance to go a long way in a field that he likes.
