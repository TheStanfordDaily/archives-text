# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Let the '"Great American Pooblic" I
decide the prohibition question!
The wets—believing that the de
pression and A1 Capone have got
the drys on the run—want a na
tional referendum on the eighteenth
amendment. The drys with nothing
to gain and everything to lose pre
fer to sit tight and let the wets
holler. The Literary Digest poll I
showing about 70 per cent of the
nation for prohibition repeal has
had a tremendous influence. It has
made the "liberals" as hopeful as i
little boys on Christmas Eve; while
it has set their opponents whistling
in the darkness.
But the Digest poll is not a true
barometer. It may record the senti
ment of people but not of voters.
The Anti-Saloon League brings or
drives its "people" to the polls on
election day while many of the
Digest "voters" are not registered—
and if registered are too busy com
plaining about the evils of prohibi
tions to their friends to vote. A
democracy does not mirror a ma
jority; it mirrors fairly well the
voting majority. Here is where the
drys win out. They are organized
to four inches above the hilt.
But suppose we did have a refer
endum and the nation voted dry
while New York and surrounding
states voted wet. Should the mil- j
lions in that region be bound by |
the fanaticism of the "Bible Belt"? j
In matters of war and foreign re
lations, the U.S. must act as a unit.
Yet that does not mean that the

palate in New York must be legally
arid to satisfy the moral convictions
in lowa or Kansas. State option
would cure this situation.
Carry the matter further, how
ever. Should the people in Chicago
have to pay tribute to cut-throats
and have their taste perverted at
the same time, because the farmers
"down state" feel that the chemical
compound termed "alcohol" is
closely related to the devil? The
several millions in the Windy City,
it would be thought, should decide
for themselves what to drink.
Now this might be carrying things
far enough—but let's take the last
step. Because all the Burps, the
Zilchs, and Doakes are sure that the
slide to Hell is slickened with gin,
why must any one individual be
forced to dring bootleg? In other
words why not put legal liquor
consumption on the same basis as
illegal liquor consumption—indi
vidual taste?
Of course, if people drive while
intoxicated, sots make public nui
sances of themselves—then the pub
lic will must be exercised. But as
long as the individual can make
drinking a personal matter, why
should not the state allow him that
privilege?
To educate people against the
"evils of liquor" is anybody's privi
lege. To force people into a uniform
mold to exalt the inner-righteous
ness of holy reformers is contrary
to any interpretation of personal
libery. . —Abe Mellinkofl'
