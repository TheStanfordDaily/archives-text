Egypt |
Hello! And don't think for a min- !
ute that we aren't getting e-gipped j
right and left in this league. Just 1
fawncy, Arbuthnot, a country where
they don't appreciate the fact that j
an "S" and a tall tree on your belt
j buckle should mean free-entry and j
a welcome wherever the wearer j
chooses to go! Wait till Secretary
of the Interior F<.L.W. hears about
this!
Otherwise, Egypt is a fairly |
pleasant, old, hot country.
Everybody wears white, which
of course is supposed to be the
color of innocence and purity,
hut that is obviously a gag sin«e
Egypt is so old that ii must have
I better sense.
At that, they are still talking !
! about Cleopatra and Pharaoh's;
Daughter, which is stupid because '
i it happened so long ago that they !
aren't even sure which clump of
' rushes young Mostjs was found in.
| They have what is supposed to have
j been Cleo's golden barge, pretty
i well preserved, but any of the
' Campus Politicians' Packards would
I run circles around it, any day of
I the week. At that, Caesar must have
' been a pretty fine guy—but now we
are getting involved and 'way over
j Enema's heads.
To get hack to the matter un
derfoot, the prehistoric Egyp
tians dressed in skin. That was
a very fine idea, except that
there should have been restric
tions, which there were not. like
in the modern Follies, in which
there are. Some much-lieralded
beauties of the Palo Alto Farm
should have been quite happy
in Ancient Egypt.
It also suddenly comes to our,
i alleged mind that mixed up some
i where in the story of Egypt were
a lot of Pharisees. Maybe they
didn't belong in Egypt at all but
: anyway they were interesting old
birds who liked to show off their
goodness by praying in synonyms.
I This was pretty hard on un-edu-

]cated snoopers who weren't we]]-up
jon their dictionaries, and so they
studied late at night and became a
' highly educated nation.
Speaking' of dictionaries, wc
would like to exile some of the j
guys who make up cross-word
puzzles to this place, and make
them live off the things they
could find here which are ac
tually called by the names they
give them in puzzles. We spent
| all yesterday morning looking
for an nglorkx, but finally gave j
up.
One kind old native thought he
: understood what we wanted, and i
i also thought that we looked sort of '
! hungry, so he took us to his house j
j and surreptitiously offered us a !
■ meal consisting of food that one of j
j his ancestors had had buried with |
: him, a mere two thousand years j
| ago. In prosperous times, such a j
[feast is a real event, but there is a
1 depression even down here, and his
. family were plain hungry. So we |
thanked him and departed, feeling ;
| a little noble and more than a little
|as though we had a touch of the
.famous Roble plague.
