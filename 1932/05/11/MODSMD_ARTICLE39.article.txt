THREE ONE-ACT PLAYS—At the
Palo Alto Community House.
Last Monday night the Palo Alto
' Community Players again displayed
I their versatility, presenting an in
| terestingly varied program of three
I one-act plays.
The curtains parted first on James
1 Sandoe's production of Branch
j Cabell's "The Jewel Merchants," a
tale of old Tuscany. Sandoe was
i hampered by lack of equipment, but
' managed to make out of this ro
; mantical-sophisticated play a fine
' production, occasionally slow in
' tempo.
Ruth Evans' heroine was charm
ing to look at, and her voice is
pleasing; she appeared, however, to
! lack self-confidence. Robert Brauns

played his hero with the appropri
ate lightness of touch and ease of
! movement. Burton Cairns as the
, menace was thoroughly at home in
! his part.
"Joint Owners in Spain" was a
. | hilarious comedy of an old ladies'
home, played by two splendid per
formers. Margaret Gerlough was
the whining, chair-rocking, touchy
. ! old woman who couldn't get along
I with anyone. The fun arises from
her being placed with another old
woman with whom no one could
get along, a vigorous, independent
woman, with ideas. Emily Gerlough
was excellent in this part.
The third play, "When Witches
Ride," was M(ell done, but the play
is a rather loosely constructed af-
i 1 fair. Lois Williams as the witch, and
Jake Harris as "fearless Jake" were
i j outstanding. —E.C.
