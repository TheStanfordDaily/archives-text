The Editor, Sir:
In Helen Masters Bunting's letter j
concerning the Mussie cgse she |
stated the following: "We must not
lose sight of the hideousness of the ;
crime committed against a defense
less woman. It matters not whether
the woman were white or black or ;
whether the attacker were black 01
white. It was a crime of unspeak- j
able horror, and it was obvious that
it was to go unpunished." As far as
the above statement goes, I tho
roughly agree with Miss Bunting, i
In fact, I even think that Mr. Mel
linkoff agrees to that, unless I am i
grossly mistaken. But as far as 1
can see, that is the only thing which ;
Miss Bunting said that was true. I j
doubt very much that Miss Bunting j
has been in Hawaii. Otherwise, I
don't see how she could give Mr.
MellinkofT the grand "calling down"
that she did.
The papers have given gross mis- ,
representations of the Massie Case. ;
They have made it a race issue in
stead of an issue between indi
viduals. Though many people know
rthat they shouldn't believe all that
they read in the papers, the people '
on the mainland have largely taken '
down the whole story, hook, line, l
and sinker. There is no doubt that j
many still think that people in
Hawaii go around half-naked and j
live in grass huts. So it isn't hard f
to make them believe that, after the I
Massie Case, Hawaiian, Japanese !
and Chinese boys would be lurking 1
in every dark corner and watch for
chances to pounce upon any woman ;
that may happen by. Likewise, it ,
is not hard to make them believe j
I that the white man has been gross- i
ly maltreated in his "native" courts.
The impression that is given is '
j quite erroneous. If there is any
j prejudice in Hawaii, it favors the
! white man. Take the court in this
, case. The judge, prosecutor, and 1

Hawaii has been the testin

there is still some racial consciov

Stripped of all its garment, t
