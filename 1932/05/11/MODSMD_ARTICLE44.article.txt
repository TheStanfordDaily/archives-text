Although the 3,000 meter steeple
chase is one of the least-known
Olympic races, it often furnishes
more thrills than the rest of the
track and field program combined.
The same question-mark which sur
rounds long-distance steeplechase
horse races applies when two
footed runners begin skimming the
three-foot hedges and five-loot
water jumps of the steeplechase
course.
Loukola of Finland, who holds the
Olympic record for the event at
9:2/.8 is the logical favorite for this
year's 3,000-meter (about two miles)
race, but the Finnish runner will
have a great battle on his hands
when he faces Joe McCluskey (9.37),
who won the event at the Penn
Relays, and the English champion,
Bailey, who ran a 3200-meter

| steeplechase in 9:52. Bailey's time
I appears to be slightly better than
i Loukola's 9:27.8 for the shorter dis
i tance, while McCluskey has never
I been given any real competition in
i his annual attempt at the Penn Re
-1 lays. Folch, the outstanding mem
i ber of Spain's track team, has run
I the distance in 10:17.
Steve Dobbs, the University of
I San Francisco two-miler, appears to
!be the outstanding Pacific Coast
I candidate for the American 3,000-
meter steeplechase team, barring
McCluskey.
Stan Devlin, freshman two-miler,
appears to be the only Stanford
candidate for the American steeple
chase team. After his only attempt
in the Irish Marathon over the bar
| riers, Devlin is still a bit doubtful
I about attempting this gruelling race.
