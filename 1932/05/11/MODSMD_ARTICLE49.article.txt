BEN EASTMAN is reel news. But
there was a time when he wasn'tâ€”
a time not so very long ago. When
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. news di
rector, announced to an unbeliev
ing world that Ben would break the
world's record for the 440-yard run
on Saturday afternoon, the 26th of
March, at 3 o'clock, the news reel
men were inclined to reply with
that most unkind but nevertheless
expressive of phrases, "Oh, yeah?"
Maybe they didn't say it, but that's
what they meant.
One of them went so far as to
telegraph New York for instruc
tions, but the terse answer came
back, "Do not cover."
And so it came to pass that Ben
Bangs Eastman ran his race and set
his record. All manner of still pho
tographers were there, but not one
news reel camera to record his feat
TWO WEEKS later Don Lie
bendorfer again had an an
nouncement for a now credulous
and receptive world. This time
Eastman was going to take a
crack at the half-mile record.
"But I warn you,'' Lieben
dorfer told each news reel bu
reau in turn, "he may not make
it. lie has much less chance of
breaking the 880 record than he ,

J did the 440 mark two weeks ago j
because of his lack of experience
in running this event."
When Ben Bangs took his
marks at the start of -his now
historic half-mile trek, however,
j no less than live motion picture
cameras were trained on him.
Three of them were equipped
with sound. The footage used to
record that race would reach >
from here to there.
"We couldn't afl'ord to take a ;
chance this time," the photo
graphers explained. '
.. ..
AND SO Eastman becamc reel !
! news. When he went South for the j
U.S.C. meet, one Hollywood con- *
cern wanted him to go out to the |
| Olympic Stadium in the MORNING i
! to caper before their cameras for a j
S special reel. This in spite of the fact ;
i that Ben had three chores ahead of
him in the afternoon.
But perhaps that was a dark Tro
jan plot!
Posterity will not see Eastman's
! quarter-mile run, but if you want >
I to see just how he broke the half- i
, mile record, you will have that op- j
i portunity at the Stanford theatre |
i Thursday. Manager Harry Brown
j has arranged for a special showing
of the entire race for that day only.
