# EX-COMMITTEE AWARDS CUPS FOR DEBATERS
## Two Amendments Added To Number To Present To A.S.S.U. May 24 
### 
Two more amendments to the
A.S.S.U. constitution were proposed
last night by the Executive Com
mittee, bringing the total of such
propositions to five which will be
submitted to the student body in
the regular spring election on May
24.
Following a powerful appeal by
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, to make fencing a first class
minor sport, the committee decided
to propose an amendment which, in
substance, abolishes the distinction
between minor sports. In form, it
raises fencing, handball, gymnastics,
and rifle shooting to the rank of
unqualified minor sports.
Award Systems Changed
Another amendment would alter
the system of awards for swimming
and water polo, changing Article
VIII, Section 3, sub-section "a" of
the A.S.S.U. constitution to read:
"Any man who wins a point or frac
tion thereof in the California swim
ming meet 01* in the minor sports
tournament, or who competes three
minutes in water polo against Cali
fornia and/or Southern California,
shall be awarded a Circle Block
's:"
Official confirmation was given to
make May 24 the date for the regu
lar spring election.
