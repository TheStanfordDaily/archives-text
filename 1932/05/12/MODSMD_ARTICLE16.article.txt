# TROY FAVORED FOR HONORS AT FRESNO RELAYS
## Stanford Sends Fourteen Men South; Brugman To Pay Own Way 
### Dick Strouse 
Having practiced for a week and i
a half the art of losing gracefully to I
Southern California's Trojans, Stan- |
ford's spikemen are now well pre
pared to face those Trojans as well
as sundry selected stars of the Los
Angeles Athletic Club, and Califor
nia in Saturday's Fresno Relays. A
Stanford victory is as impossible as I
it would be pleasing to the Farm, |
and for that reason Coach Bill El- |
lington is taking along only those J
men who have a real chance to j
place.
The squad will be led by Ben |
Eastman, who will run only one j
event, his match race with Eddie :
Genung of Washington having defin- ,
itely been called off. Eastman will I
not race Genung because of the I
California Intercollegiates on May 29, j
in which the Cards will be out to try I
and take the Trojans.
Genung Stays North
Eastman will not race Genung also j
because Genung will not be at the |
| meet, he having decided that he pre- i
fers the snow of Washington to the |
sun of California. Of course, Ben
might run the ace from the North
in a telegraphic meet. Ben might
race some other Stanford half-miler J
and Genung a fellow Husky, and the !
results telegraphed in. The man who
beat his team-mate by the greatest
distance would be declared the win- i
ner and the new world's champion. 1
But .;ad as it may be, Eastman will
not race Genung because Genung
will not be at Fresno to be raced.
Gus Meier, who is slated to take
ihe highs at Fresno if the great
U.S.C. Trio follows advance notices
and stays out of the individual event
in order to attack the world's shuttle
I hurdle relay mark, will have a
j running-mate in the person of Jack
I Brugman. Brugman was not listed
I among "Ellington's Fourteen Points"
! who officially constitute the Card
j squad and who hope to garner more
! than a point-a-man, but Jack plans
I on going to Fresno on his own in
| order to run.
It's a Hoax
A great plan to score a surprise
Stanford victory over the other
teams at Fresno has been uncovered.
But it has also fallen through, al
-1 though the idea had possibilities,
j It seems that the first part of the
! scheme was to run Ben Eastman, Ben
' Eastman, Ben Eastman, and Ben
j Eastman in the half-mile, mile, two
mile, and four-mile relays, thus in
j suring Stanford four wins right off
1 the bat. A1 Masters refused to let
\ this quartet run the distance medley
| as well, as he didn't want to ask too
i much of it.
' Jim Ferries, Ralph Giberson, George
Naylon, and Bob Atkinson were go
! ing to step right into the gap, how
j ever, and take that there medley
! race. Since the boys neglected to
j figure out how they were going to
l win, they have decided to spend the
j week-end on the campus.
The rest of this perfect scheme
; concerned boxing Frank Wykoff in
the 100. probably by building a cage
! around him.
