*> The accident occurred at about
8:45 o'clock. The car, owned and
driven by Giberson, was traveling
north along the highway at about
45 miles an hour. At the intersec
tion of the San Antonio road Giber
| son was forced to swerve off the
j pavement when the car ahead
! slowed suddenly.
When he tried to swing hack onto
the highway again, he said, the
, wheels turned to the left and locked,
and the car slid in the loose dirt
J and rolled over.
The roadster made one complete
; revolution, ending up on its wheels,
! and the three occupants were
thrown out as it rolled. All three'
i struck the ground head first,
j The injured men were brought to
the Palo Alto Hospital on the cam
i pus by D. W. Lee. John Glenn, and
j Walter Hawkins, who were follow
ing in another car a short distance
â–  behind.
Dr. Blake C. Wilbur, who was
I called on the case, held practically
j no hope for Stratton's recovery, al
though he said that the miraculous
j vitality the man had already shown
I might last him through.
Stratton's parents in San Jose and
a brother in a Palo Alto suburb
were notified, and were at his side
last night. Giberson's parents in
Piichmond were also notified of the
accident.
Giberson's injury will keep the
track star out of the Fresno Relays,
and may prevent him from compet
ing the rest of the season.
Stratton, an Economics major,
transferred here from San Jose
i State College two years ago. Pre
vious to that time, however, he was
: out of school for several years, most
jof them spent in South American
; countries, where he worked in sev
j eral mines.
I Irons was already recovering from
i another injury to his foot, and had
1 left the hospital only a week ago.
I He was still using crutches, which
were demolished in the wreck.
Palo Alto police officers declared
no other cars were involved in the
accident, and that there probably
I will be no investigation. The scene
iof the crash is across the county
| line and under the jurisdiction of
| Ihe state police in the San Jose dis
j trict, but Palo Alto officers were
first on the scene and took charge.
