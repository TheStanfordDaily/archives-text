# AN EASTERN "RACKET"
## 
### 
Of interest to students casting about for a summer job is
the report compiled by twenty-seven eastern colleges con
cerning the soliciting of subscriptions for magazines and
nationally advertised articles.
The st;i I islics show :
1. Less than half of the men reporting stayed ten weeks.
A large percentage of the men left their jobs at the end of
three or four weeks.
2. The average gross amount earned by the individual
students who reported was only $211 and the net amount
earned above expenses was -Y'.M. The average amount per
hour was only fifty-one cents and the average individual
profit per hour over expenses was twenty-one cents.
'A. Training and supervision of sunjmer salesmen has
proven to be inadequate/more than fifty per cent staling
that they were not supervised in any way.
I. More than half of the students reporting declared
that they had been urged to use their college connections to
promote sales.
The Columbia Spectator, from which the above statistics
were taken, also states that many of the selling schemes
were "nothing short of a swindle."
The Stanford Appointment Otlice recommends certain
firms, which they have thoroughly investigated, to the stu
dents as offering dependable and well-paid jobs for the
summer. Students intending to take a try at the selling
game during the coming vacation would do well to follow
the recommendations of the Appointment Otlice. If they
iiitc nd to work for some other concern, for their own pro
tection they should carefully look into the proposition of
fered them lest they become entangled in some unfavorable
contract as has been the fate of these eastern college men.
