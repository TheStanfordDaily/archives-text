# ANT POWDER!
## 
### 
It seems strange that hall men on a campus of a great
university should have to resort to insect powder to combat
an ant plague.
Cannot some of the numerous prospective biologists, en
gineers, and psychologists get together and work out a plan
whereby the tiny but very annoying insects could be steri
lized, shut out or persuaded away from Eneina, Tovon,
Brainier and Sequoia halls?
Verily, we resemble the proverbial duck hunter who,
though equipped with a double-barrel shot gun, attempts to
sprinkle salt.on the tails of his prey.
