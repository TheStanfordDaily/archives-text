Dance committeemen ai the I "niversity of .Minnesota
seem fo ho- a hit cleverer than those at Washington. Or*
perhaps the students at the middle-western institution and
the nativ< s thereabouts are a hit dmnhcr than citizens of
Seattle.
A few weeks ago the chairman of the Cadet Rail at
I". of \V. had himself kidnaped to ballyhoo his dance,
hoaxed the city of Seattle as well as students for a day, and
then drew the wrath of both upon his head when it was
discovered that his escapade was but an advertising stunt.
He who was a good enough publicity man to work out
the scheme was evidently too good a publicity man to put
il over, lie had worked himself into such a lather over his
own dance that he couldn't miss ii himself, so he arranged
for iii.s return in lime to attend, thus drawing the suspicion
of all.
Last week the leader of the Minnesota Senior Hall was
mysteriously kidnaped several days before his dance. Ho
lurned after the affair was well under way, he was too
tired, 100 bruised and battered tor Prom merrymaking. The
next day he told his wild tale of abduction, and it was
swallowed whole by students and public alike.
Smart bovs, these Minnosotans!
