Dance committeemen at the University of Minnesota
seem to be a bit cleverer than those at Washington. Or
perhaps the students at the middle-western institution and
the natives thereabouts are a bit dumber than citizens of
Seattle.
A few weeks ago the chairman of the Cadet Ball at
U. of W. had himself kidnapped to ballyhoo his dance,
hoaxed the city of Seattle as well as students for a day, and
then drew the wrath of both upon his head when it was
discovered that his escapade was but an advertising stunt.
He who was a good enough publicity man to work out
the scheme was evidently too good a publicity man to put
it over. He had worked himself into such a lather over his
own dance that he couldn't miss it himself, so he arranged
for his return in time to attend, thus drawing the suspicion
of all.
Last week the leader of the Minnesota Senior Ball was
mysteriously kidnaped several days before his dance. Ho
turned after the affair was well under way, he was too
tired, too bruised and battered tor Prom merrymaking. The
next day he told his wild tale of abduction, and it was
swallowed whole by students and public alike.
Smart boys, these Minnesotans!
