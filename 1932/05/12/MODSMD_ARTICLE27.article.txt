# BULL SESSION
## LET 'EM IN 
### 
One of the most-talked-of things
with the least actual basis is the
Stanford Hough. He is defined,
criticized, praised as if he were a
living thing—and yet in reality he
is fast becoming a campus tradi
tion—which is identical with a dead
custom. The last stab at this totter
ing creature is the prevalent sys
tem of keeping him on the cold out
side hungering for the rhythmic
melodies that he hears and the glid
ing couples that he sees. This is,
indeed, the most cruel thrust of all.
To run through a healthy man is
sad; to puncture a half-dead, bleed
ing, withered hulk approaches the
tragic.
The rough is tragic. Why make
him a tragic memory? Let him live
as a remembrance of the Stanford
that-was; an da wholesome demo
cratic influence in the Stanford
that-is. There are no roughs at the
Inaugural Ball at Washington. There
are no roughs at the San Francisco
hotels. But obviously Stanford is
neither Washington nor San Fran
cisco. By what measure has it been
decreed that a campus dance should
duplicate a hotel in the City? The
fact that admitting roughs is dif
ferent is no reason why admitting'
roughs is worse.
That the women almost univer
sally favor the innoculation of new
male blood into a dance about mid
night is evident. It gives them that
sense of popularity and of being the
chased butterfly. They never" need

i stop to consider that the roughs
I must "cut" Ihem. For obviously the
| roughs do not come to dance with
| themselves. The sudden rush of
maledom acts* as a sweet and yet
j potent stimulant making an aver
age date bearable and a good date
quite enjoyable.
But what about those that bring
them? What about those that hunt
hard, dig deep, and finally produce
j painfully the required coin of the
realm? They too receive advan
tages. First of all, once cut they are
'free to make the acquaintance of
the "fancy" m the red dress; or that
"import" dancing over in the corner.
Also the sad face of economic or
scholastic fate may sometime turn
its withering stare in your direc
! tion. Then what? After a long grind
at the typewriter, is it not enjoyable
to leave for a while and enjoy a
little gamboling on the waxed Hoor?
1 This relaxation is always available
j if roughs are admitted.
Of course those persons who al
ways and invariably are "roughs"
and never come through with any
dates are scavengers on the system.
; But every desirable system has its
\ drawbacks.
It must be remembered at all
; times, however, that a gentleman
will never "cut" on the last dance.
The last dance is somewhat sacred
land is reserved for him who brought
her. The true rough never violates
1 this unwritten command,

1 this unwritten command,
j —Abe Mellinkoff
One of the most-talked-of things
with the least actual basis is the
Stanford Hough. He is defined,
criticized, praised as if he were a
living thing—and yet in reality he
is fast becoming a campus tradi
tion—which is identical with a dead
custom. The last stab at this totter
ing creature is the prevalent sys
tem of keeping him on the cold out
side hungering for the rhythmic
melodies that he hears and the glid
ing couples that he sees. This is,
indeed, the most cruel thrust of all.
To run through a healthy man is
sad; to puncture a half-dead, bleed
ing, withered hulk approaches the
tragic.
The rough is tragic. Why make
him a tragic memory? Let him live
as a remembrance of the Stanford
that-was; an da wholesome demo
cratic influence in the Stanford
that-is. There are no roughs at the
Inaugural Ball at Washington. There
are no roughs at the San Francisco
hotels. But obviously Stanford is
neither Washington nor San Fran
cisco. By what measure has it been
decreed that a campus dance should
duplicate a hotel in the City? The
fact that admitting roughs is dif
ferent is no reason why admitting'
roughs is worse.
That the women almost univer
sally favor the innoculation of new
male blood into a dance about mid
night is evident. It gives them that
sense of popularity and of being the
chased butterfly. They never" need

i stop to consider that the roughs
I must "cut" Ihem. For obviously the
| roughs do not come to dance with
| themselves. The sudden rush of
maledom acts* as a sweet and yet
j potent stimulant making an aver
age date bearable and a good date
quite enjoyable.
But what about those that bring
them? What about those that hunt
hard, dig deep, and finally produce
j painfully the required coin of the
realm? They too receive advan
tages. First of all, once cut they are
'free to make the acquaintance of
the "fancy" m the red dress; or that
"import" dancing over in the corner.
Also the sad face of economic or
scholastic fate may sometime turn
its withering stare in your direc
! tion. Then what? After a long grind
at the typewriter, is it not enjoyable
to leave for a while and enjoy a
little gamboling on the waxed Hoor?
1 This relaxation is always available
j if roughs are admitted.
Of course those persons who al
ways and invariably are "roughs"
and never come through with any
dates are scavengers on the system.
; But every desirable system has its
\ drawbacks.
It must be remembered at all
; times, however, that a gentleman
will never "cut" on the last dance.
The last dance is somewhat sacred
land is reserved for him who brought
her. The true rough never violates
