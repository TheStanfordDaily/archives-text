SHOPWORN—At the New Menlo
Theatre.
Again Barbara Stanwyck goes
into hysterics, again rises to the
peak of frenzied action, and once
again shows herself to be a truly
fine actress.
It's the same old story of a
thwarted love—only this time it's
the boy's nagging mother who docs.i
the thwarting. But strangely enough
the girl doesn't go wrong. In fact
i she rises to stardom as a Broadway
I hit, then flaunts her success in the
face of her former boy friend,
Regis Toomey.
So we have plot and counterplot,
speedy developments, a reversal,
, but in the end, just as we thought
that the mother was going to kill
Barbara, everything turns out all
right.
Stanwyck's acting is truly mar
velous from an emotional sfand
point. It's even better than "For
bidden." —J.H.G.
HIEROGLYPH. LITERARY AN
NUAL.—Published by Scroll and
Stylus. College of the Pacific.
1932.
The second issue of this magazine
shows considerable improvement
over the first, a mixture of melo
drama and sewer waters with a few
I stars flung gracefully in. The no
| vices are, however, still too dearly
attached to the gods that are Faulk
ner, Hemmingway, and Joyce. Their
prose is often an etymological hash,
cumbersome, uneasy, and endless,
i There is exhibited a faint desire
to be clever which succumbs insuf
ficiently and in badly worded
phrases before it begins. Jaunice
Dixon succeeds best; her wit, in
stead of striving to be sophisticated,
is delicately whimsical. Miss Dixon's
contributions are consistently amus
ing and unassuming.
I There is a great deal of emotional
i striving and complaining, some of
which is successful, most of which
is typical and familiar. Some ex
perimentation, interesting but near
ly all colorless, is the work of Bob
Linn.
Typographically and literally the
whole tone is tremendously im
proved although the strivers, ever
i seeking the unusual, have forsaken
some uniquenesses only to adopt
others. But the appearance and
context has changed from rash and
bad journalism to the representa
tion of adolescent cries, not strik
ingly original, to be sure, but sin
j cerely expressed and worthy of con
sidering hearers. —J.S.S.
I SPRINGTIME FOR HENRY—At the
Curran Theatre.
Here goes for a bit of a rave!
! "Springtime for Henry" is the best
' evening's entertainment since
"Grand Hotel" to which it can
hardly be compared because of the
1 extreme diversity of the two plays.
Benn Levy's farce is light and
I fresh and gaily naughty—utterly
i carefree and, let us call it sophisti
cated. You'll know what we mean
1 despite the unfitness of the word.
In other words, don't invite your
puritanical aunt to go. She quite
probably won't enjoy it. However,
there are very few among us who
"pay to the order of Stanford Uni
versity" who will not be thoroughly
delighted by this racy bit of drama
i so sparklingly presented.

The cast consists of four charac
ters whom we already know
through movie acquaintance; Laura
La Plante, Ruth Weston, Tyrrell
Davis, and Edward Everett Hor
ton, who is undoubtedly a comic
magician with a bag packed full of
grimaces and laughs.
It is, indeed, springtime for Henry
and for Henry's audience because
the audience is highly amused and
because the play deals with a young
man's fancy and also with love—at
least a certain kind of love.—E.E.H.
THE TRIAL OF VIVIAN WARE—
At the Stanford Theatre.
Once in a while a talkie comes
along that has a bang-up plot, a
smooth piece of photography and a
cast that fits the story—once in a
while. And "The Trial of Vivian
Ware" seems to have just these re
quirements that really make a good
murder story.
Joan Bennett takes the part of
Vivian, and manages to convince
you on the witness stand that—well,
judge, she just couldn't have com
mitted the murder, but the odds
are against ihe poor girl. All the
tricks of the thriller tx - ade are used,
but used as they seldom are used.
Fast shooting, clever sequence of
scenes, and a glamorous setting, all
contribute in achieving a (what
seemed to us) short two hours of
entertainment.
Zasu Pitts is in her prime as the
sob-sister reporter, and keeps the
radio audience spellbound during
the court scenes. "Skeets" Gallagher
is the big-shot radio speaker, and
what a voice.
Lillian Bond as the hotcha chorus
witness pulls some cracks that are
really new. Ben Eastman is on to
day only. We missed him, but the
showfs worth the price of admis
sion.
