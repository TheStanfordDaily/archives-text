# FARM IS HAY-HAY! STUDENTS TO PAY; EXPEL FIRE BUGS
## 
### 
The old Farm is going hay
hay in a big way early this
year. This was evidenced late
last night in back of the Deke
house, when the annual hay
stuck burning season received
its official send-off, as the first
pyre was prematurely ignited
by an Indian or Indians un
known.
Fire Chief Dugan received
Ihe special alarm about 10:30
o'clock, and within ten or fif
teen minutes (after warming
up the prize engine of the
Stanford outfit) was busy on
the scene and had the situa
tion well under control.
Although no other damage
than that to tin- hay stack was
encountered, the cost of the
destruction must be met by
the Associated Students. Every
year the stacks are cut for the
purpose of being sold for in
come. Chief Dugan added that
the penalty for arson on the
campus is expulsion from
school and immediate cancel
lation of registration.
