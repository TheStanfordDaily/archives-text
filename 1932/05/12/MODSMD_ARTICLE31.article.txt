SUCH BRAVERY!
i The Editor, Sir:
Gladdened to the depths at the
: splendid attitude taken by a num
ber of recent Campus Opinion
j writers in your columns, I want to
: take this opportunity to publicly
congratulate their efforts. Of course,
sir, I refer to those letters right
eously attacking your Bull Session
' columnist.
How well that attack has been
i made! Too wise were those writers
i to take up any argumentative points
with Mr. Mellinkoff. Well' they
! knew how that fiend could quibble
I and rout them at .that game. Sage
and doughty warriors, they got
down to the roots of the evil and
assailed personalitiesâ€”and that hor
rible name of your columnist. The
mind can be easily tricked and
: swayed, but there is no Achilles'
heel to emotions. Emotional appeals
' show that scoundrel, Mellinkoff, up
for what he is.
Thank God there are a few fear
j less souls left to attack evil at its
foundations.
Yours, Stan Holmes
