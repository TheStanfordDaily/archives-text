By Albert Guerarcl
All Eastman-Rampling and Wy
koff-Jonath duels notwithstanding,
the 1500-meter race at Los Angeles
this summer should furnish the
greatest competition of the 1932
Olympic Games.
The greatest Held of distance run
ners since the revival of the modern
Olympic Games will meet over this
slightly less than one-mile course,
with entries from Finland, United
States, Germany, England, Poland,
Denmark, and Sweden outstanding.
Take Jules Ladoumegue of France,
who (with the possible exception of
Ben Eastman), is the greatest run
ner the writer has ever seen.
Greatest Runner
This decision was made after
watching Paavo Nurmi, Sera Mar
tin, Willie Ritola, Harry Larva, Joie
Ray, D.G.A. Lowe, "Bud" Spencer,
Charley Paddock, Frank WykofT,
Percy Williams, and many others
frequently mentioned as the "world's
best." Unfortunately for France's
Olympic chances and spectators at
Los Angeles this summer, Ladou
megue has been barred from ama
teur competition because of profes
sional charges. If Ladoumegue com
petes in the Tenth Olympiad he will
win either the 1500 or 5000 meters.
Like Eastman, Ladoumegue is too
good to be beaten twice in one meet.

1500 METERS
1. Purje (Finland)
2. Venzke (United Slates)
3. Larva (Finland)
4. Thomas (England)
5. Lehtinen (Finland)

The French champion's times are
five seconds better than Purje's over
the 1500-meter distance. Ladou
megue has run 1500 meters in 3:49.8
and one mile in 4:09.2* Purje's best
time is 3:52 for 1500 meters, Leh
tinen and Larva have both done
3:52.(5.
Olympic Record
Harry Larva is given no more
than third because he seems to
have slowed down a bit since set
ting the Olympic record at Amster
dam (3:53.2). The true worth of
these three Finnish distance stars
will be appreciated when their
marks for the two-mile run are
considered:
Lehtinen 9:00.5
Purje 9:00.8
Larva 9:01.3
Gene Venzke is almost on a par
with Purje in consideration for
first - place honors. Venzke has
blossomed out in one year from a
mediocre miler to become the first
American with a chance of upset
ting the Nordic distance T running
supremacy.
Gene Venzke
Venzke has run one mile indoors
in 4:10, which would be equal to
about 3:51 for 1500 meters, but it
must be remembered that many
champions on the boards fail to
equal their indoor records when
they get out on the cinders.
R. H. Thomas of England will be
a serious contender. His time of
4:13.4 for one mile is wonderful,
but no indication of his true worth.
When he set this mark, Thomas led
by a hundred yards at the begin
ning of his final lap, and practically
walked in at the finish. International
competition may drive him to new
records.
4:08.4 ?? ?
Raaefel Ahmed's name is con
spicuous by its absence in the above
dope sheet. The Indian runner,
credited with 4:08.4 for one mile,
has never turned in any other per
formances to substantiate this rec
ord. It may be true. Again the 4:08.4
might have been for 1500 meters,
arid changed into the mile distance
by some erring telegraph operator.
The Finnish contingent is even
more outstanding in the 5000-meter
race. Paavo Nurmi (14:28.2), Leh
tinen (14:31.7) and Virtanen (14.40.8)
face only one serious competitor,
Kusocinski of Poland, who has done
14:42.8.

5000 METERS
1. Lehtincn (Finland)
2. Virtanen (Finland)
I',. Kusocinski (Poland)
4. Evanson (England)
5. Syring (Germany)

Nurn>i is not given a place, be
cause the "Flying Finn" will prob
ably concentrate on the 10,000-ine
ter and marathon races. Helber of
Germany, Bognerud of Norway, and
Magnuson of Sweden, and Cunier
and Boitard of France will be strong
contenders.
Gene Venzke is not the only
American hope in the distance
races.
Leo Lermond, national champion
for the one-mile run (beating Gene
Venzke in 4:15), Ralph Hill, now
competing for the Olympic Club,
Henry Brocksmith, the powerful
Indiana runner, and Louis Greg

ory, national six-mile champion,
form a powerful quartet to back up
Venzke's challenge to the Finnish
winning tradition.
