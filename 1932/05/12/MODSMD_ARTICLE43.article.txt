Ben Eastman, at the right, is shown as he nosed out Vic Williams in the 410 at last year's California
Intercollegiates in Los Angeles to tie the then world's record of 47.4 seconds. Williams later won the 1.C.4-A.
from Eastman in the same time. They will meet again at the Fresno Relays, Saturday, in the final lap of the
mile relay race, Williams running for the Los Angeles Athletic Club. Art Woessner will carry U.S.C.'s baton
to the tape in the same race, so that plenty of excitement is assured.
