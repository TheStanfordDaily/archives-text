SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA is cer
tain to win the Fresno Relays. Of
course, you may say that there is
nothing new about that statement.
But what we mean to say is that
those Terrible Trojan fellers are
more certain than ever of cleaning
up Saturday night.
"TROJAN HOPES FOR FRESNO
RELAYS SATURDAY MARRED BY
CRIPPLED PERFORMERS" says a
headline in the Southern California
Daily Trojan. "Dean Cromwell will
take a crippled squad of trackmen
to Fresno," continues Max Plake,
sports editor. "Many of his star per
formers ai"e on the shelf with in
juries which will hamper their run
ning considerably, making Troy's
chances of taking the championship
rather slim."
Wehner, Wykoff, and Halstead are
among those on the aforementioned
"shelf." All of which would seem
to indicate that Wehner, Wykoff and
Halstead will all turn in their most
brilliant performances of the season
under the Fresno arcs.
HOW COME?
We can't seem to forget an
other headline in that same
Daily Trojan on the day before
the Stanford ftieet. "CHLENT
ZOS, HALSTEAD AND PAYNE
IIIT BY AILMENTS ON EVE
OF MEET' was what it said.
Friend Max went on to explain
that Chlentzos had a leg injury
which might prevent him from
taking more than one jump,
Halstead had a sprained ankle
and Payne was bothered by an

| old muscle injury.
Maybe so. But we seem to j
remember that Chlcntzos tied for
first in the pole vault, Halstead
won the mile and Payne took
second in both the high and the
low hurdles.
Poor Mr. Cromwell!
DINK TEMPLETON will soon be
| back on the farm.
After weeks spent in bed at his ]
home here and in Lane Hospital in j
| San Francisco, Dink is reported well !
1 on the road to recovery. He escaped i
! from the hospital for the second j
I time Tuesday, when Mrs. Temple- '
j ton took him for an hour's drive
| around the city.
j The chief of Stanford track af- j
! fairs expects to return to the cam- I
i pus in a few weeks. While he may
| not be able to take in the remaining
! collegiate track meets, you can bet
the 20 cents you won on Polydorus
last week that Dink will be at the
J Olympic Games or bust.

"TROJAN HOPES FOR FRESNO
RELAYS SATURDAY MARRED BY
CRIPPLED PERFORMERS" says a
headline in the Southern California
Daily Trojan. "Dean Cromwell will
take a crippled squad of trackmen
to Fresno," continues Max Plake,
sports editor. "Many of his star per
formers ai"e on the shelf with in
juries which will hamper their run
ning considerably, making Troy's
chances of taking the championship
rather slim."
Wehner, Wykoff, and Halstead are
among those on the aforementioned
"shelf." All of which would seem
to indicate that Wehner, Wykoff and
Halstead will all turn in their most
brilliant performances of the season
under the Fresno arcs.
HOW COME?
We can't seem to forget an
other headline in that same
Daily Trojan on the day before
the Stanford ftieet. "CHLENT
ZOS, HALSTEAD AND PAYNE
IIIT BY AILMENTS ON EVE
OF MEET' was what it said.
Friend Max went on to explain
that Chlentzos had a leg injury
which might prevent him from
taking more than one jump,
Halstead had a sprained ankle
and Payne was bothered by an

| old muscle injury.
Maybe so. But we seem to j
remember that Chlcntzos tied for
first in the pole vault, Halstead
won the mile and Payne took
second in both the high and the
low hurdles.
Poor Mr. Cromwell!
DINK TEMPLETON will soon be
| back on the farm.
After weeks spent in bed at his ]
home here and in Lane Hospital in j
| San Francisco, Dink is reported well !
1 on the road to recovery. He escaped i
! from the hospital for the second j
I time Tuesday, when Mrs. Temple- '
j ton took him for an hour's drive
| around the city.
j The chief of Stanford track af- j
! fairs expects to return to the cam- I
i pus in a few weeks. While he may
| not be able to take in the remaining
! collegiate track meets, you can bet
the 20 cents you won on Polydorus
last week that Dink will be at the
J Olympic Games or bust.
