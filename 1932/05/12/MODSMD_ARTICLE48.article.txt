# LONE SENIOR GOAL SUBDUES JUNIORS IN CLASS SOCCER
## Burks Scores Only Goal As Juniors Prove Inexperienced 
### 
Putting their greatest efforts into
the first ten minutes of the contest,
and then coasting the other forty
on their margin, the seniors defeated
the junior soccer team 1-0 yester
day on the varsity field to assure
themselves of a crack at the inter
class championship.
The score came after a battle in
front of the '33 goal, when Paul
Burks took a junior "save" and
drove it back through the uprights
for the only tally of the day.
Although the seniors were badly
out of practice, mosl> of them hav
ing given up playing after the sea
son closed last fall, their superior
experience and ability to handle the
ball enabled' them to play a defen
sive game that had the third-year
men completely baffled throughout
most of the fifty minutes.
The juniors had a couple of
chances at their opponents' goal, but
inexperience and lack of teamwork
kept them from rating on the score
board.
Regular practice will be held as
usual today, but Monday the cham
pionship gets • under way again
when those surprising freshmen go
after the rapidly aging fourth-year
men. The yearlings have the best
teamwork and the most ambition of
the four teams, and if they lose it
will be only because of the seniors'
superior inability to handle the bail.

Louisiana has nearly half the total
rice acreage in the United States.
