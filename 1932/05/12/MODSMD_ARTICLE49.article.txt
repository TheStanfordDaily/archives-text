# Senior Women Down Frosh in Swim Meet
## Upperclassmen Take Six Firsts in 39-26 Victory; Will Encounter Difficulty in Soph Meet 
### 
Winning six out of eight events,
| senior women splashed their way to
j a 39-26 victory over the Freshmen
i women yesterday in the first division
I of the W.A.A. swimming series,
Margery Thomas broke her fourth
| record in two meets, clipping seven
tenths of a second off of last year's
time in the 25-yard back stroke by
swimming the distance in 17.5, while
Eleanor Ophuls tied her new record
of 19 flat in the 25-yard breast
stroke.
Times as a whole were slower
than usual, with Bea Cline, senior
star in the 50- and 75-yard events
out with flu. With the exception of
the plunge and 50-yard free style,
the Frosh never offered their op
ponents any serious competition.
Weakness in these events and a
J serious threat from Dot Anne Jack
son in diving will constitute the
deepest pit-falls in the Senior-
Sophomore meet which will be held
I the first part of next week. Although
J the upperclasmen have easily won
i the interclass championship for three
; years, they will find the Sophomores
I no easy opposition.
