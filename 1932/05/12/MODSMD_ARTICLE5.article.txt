Advance reports and reviews in
dicate one of the funniest and
snappiest shows in many moons,
which means a lot in a few words,
judging from the success of past
Junior Operas. Harold Helvenston
has designed a setting for the Revue
Scene which promises to be a
striking revelation in the use of
towering figures to accent the spirit
of gaiety in the show.
Naturalness will be the keynote
of the lines in the Opera. One un
usual innovation in the character
parts is injected by the use of sev
eral of the principals' own names
in the script. Music composed by
several of the leading campus mu
sicians and lyricists is especially
written to fit the scene and the
characters. Eph Engleman, Jean
Jamison, William Mahu, and the
entire chorus will render songs of
the hotcha variety. "Ain't You Got
Sense?" is a number which should
score heavily in the opera.
Two acts and four scenes with
numerous specialties and chorus
numbers will make up the program
for the entertainment which will go
on the boards Saturday evening.
