LONDON, May 11. </P)â€”Twelve
American debutantes and matrons, |
who crossed the Atlantic to be intro- j
duced to Britain's King and Queen,
participated in a free show outside '
Buckingham Palace tonight for
which much of London was the j
audience.
Eight hundred persons of whom |
400 were debutantes, had invitations j
allowing them inside the palace, but |
80,000 must have crashed the high 1
gate at the entrance to the mall and J
gaped in wonder at so much fuss and j
feathers.
United States Ambassador Andrew
W. Mellon wore ordinary evening'
dress, including ordinary trousers,
eschewing silk breeches.
Over 42 per cent of the sales
of farm products are made during
the three months of September,
October and November.
