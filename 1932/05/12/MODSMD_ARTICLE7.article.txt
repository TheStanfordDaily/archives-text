' CAMP KEARNEY, May 11. (JP)—
| A tragic drama of the skies that
i chilled the hearts and even made
| men wearing the gold lace of high
naval command weep was written
in an unsuccessful attempt of the
world's largest airship, the U.S.S.
! Akron to land here today.
Two men were killed, and a third
! carried for two hours dangling on a
! 300-foot rope, trailed by the great
airship as it soared half a mile above
the heads of 10,000 spectators.
! SAN FRANCISCO, May 11. (>P)—
iAt the 12th Naval District Head
' quarters here, it was expected that
: the big dirigible would take off from
• Camp Kearney this morning at 7
: o'clock with the rising sun to ex
-1 pand her helium and increase her
buoyancy. If she maintains her usual
j cruising speed of 50 knots she should
: arrive over the city about 4 o'clock.
Commander Rosendahl has ra
dioed that he prefers to dock the
Akron at Sunnyvale after sunset,
so she will probably be moored to
the 77-foot temporary mast at the
! Naval Air Station by 7:30 o'clock.

: distressed by the accident and said

thing in the reports that may lead
to the installation of safety meas
ures at Sunnyvale which might pre
vent a recurrence of such a trag
