# GUITTARD GETS PLACE ON MILE RELAY QUARTET
## Sophomore To Substitute For Fullenwider At Fresno Relays D.C. NOT TO GO SOUTH Cards Should Place Third; Javelin Duel Off 
### Dick Strouse 
Paul Nash will lead off; Horace J
luittard will take the baton sec- J
nd, followed by Captain Alvin
lablcs; Ben Eastman himself will
nchor the quartet. That is the
neup of the Stanford mile relay
;am that will compete at Fresno 1
tmorrow and that hopes to earn a
rst place and four handsome
'atehes for its efforts.
A last-minute change substituted
luittard for Frank Fullenwider
'hen the latter came down with a j
>ld yesterday that will weaken
im for the race. Guittard, who led '
ff last year's freshman relay team
lat came within a fifth of a second j
f the Little Big Meet record, was I
andicapped by injuries during the j
arly part of this season, but is now
l shape.
Ray Out
A1 Ray, premier Card spear-tos
>r, will not compete at Fresno. His
lace will be taken by Dave Brown, j
•ho has been improving rapidly ;
nd has been around the 190-fooi
lark most of this week.
While mentioning the javelin: the
•mtemplated duel between Ken j
hurchill of the Olympic Club and
immie DeMers of the Los Angeles
.thletic Club will not materialize
s the Olympic Club is not sending ;
team to the meet. This will facili- |
ite Stanford's skeleton team fight- j
ig into a third place in the meet. |
Jones Best Bet
The rest of the Indian team is as '
nnounced earlier in the week. Bob
ones will throw the discus, and is I
le favorite with Here Laborde as i
is most serious rival. Nellie Gray j
eads the Stanford shot-putters, be- j
ig assisted by Laborde and John !
yman.
The pole-vaulting trio is still in- 1
ict, with the men all having hopes j
f clearing 13 feet 6 inches after \
leir improvement to the 13-foot, j
-inch mark against U.SG. Ned i
ohns, Bert DeGroot, and Bill Miller i
■ill vault.
