### 
II OPEWELL, N.J., May 12. (IV)—An intimate friend who visited Mrs. ;
j Charles A. Lindbergh late today described her as bearing up "with
i her usual equanimity" upon hearing that her kidnaped son had been
| found dead.
TRENTON. N.J., May 12. (/Pi—Two tremendous blows 011 the head
; ended the life of Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., the official autopsy by Doctor
; Charles A. Mitchell, county physician, disclosed tonight.
The autopsy showed the skull to be fractured on the left side. The (
j fracture extended from the top to just behind the left ear. The second ,
I blow was dealt on the right side of the head just back of the right car
I and left a hole one-half inch in diameter. It was as if some adult person
| had held the baby tightly in his arms and deliberately hammered the

head with the purpose of causing
instant death.
The diagnosis was: '"Death was
due to a fractured skull inflicted by
person or persons unknown."
Doctor Mitchell's report confirmed
that decomposition of the baby had
progressed to the point where it
could be surmised that the child
had been killed almost immediately
after the kidnaping, depending on
| climatic and other conditions that
| might have produced such results.
The spot of the finding of the
body as related in the announce
ment is approximately five miles
southeast by road from the Lind
bergh estate and four miles directly
across the Sourland mountains. The
Mount Rose road is a little-traveled
crossroad between Princeton and
Hopewell. There are five houses and
a general store in the Mount Rose
community.
The following police statement
was issued today by Colonel H.
j Norman Schwarzkopf, New Jersey
j state police head:
'As long as there was a possibility
of the baby being alive, the police
have been acting with a certain
amount of suppressed activity in
order not to interfere with any ne-
I gotiations that might result in the
| safe return of the baby.
"Now that the body of the baby
I has been found every possible ef
; fort will be used and all men ne
] cessary will immediately exercise
i every possible effort to accomplish
! the arrest of the kidnapers and mur
' derers. We have had under suspi
| cion a group of persons suspected
j of being the kidnapers and imme
diate steps will be taken and are
j being taken to accomplish their ar
| rest.
