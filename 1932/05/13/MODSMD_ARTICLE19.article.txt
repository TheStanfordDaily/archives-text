# SEWARD TALKS ON PLANT LIFE
## 
### 
Tracing the survival of plant
forms from the Carboniferous pe
riod down to the present, Dr. A. C.
Seward, visiting English botanist,
presented an illustrated lecture last
' night in the Geology Building under
j the auspices of the departments of
| geology and botany.
In developing his subject, "The
j Rise and Fall of Plan Dynasties,"
Dr. Seward pointed out that many of
l the present forms of flowering plants
have evolved not from similar ex-
I ternal forms in the Carboniferous
j period, but from very unlike forms,
[ possessing similar structure. He
! further stated that in all cases the
primitive forms, not the developed,
j have survived the period changes.
Last night's lecture was the sec
ond of a series of three which Dr.
Seward is giving on the campus,
i He will conclude the series with an
illustrated talk on "The Wanderings
of Plants Through the Ages," to be
j delivered tonight at 7:30 in room
i XI4. Geoloav Building.
