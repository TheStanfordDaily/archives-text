## Great Ship Loses Quarter Of Helium Gas In San Diego Landing 23 OF CREW DROPPED Dirigible Passed Over Bay Cities At Midnight 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 13. (/}>)â€”
The following message was received
from the Akron by the naval radio
station here:
"Expect arrive San Francisco
about midnight and moor during
sunrise period today, or would moor
upon arrival if visibility and other
conditions permitted. Will keep you
informed of our progress."
Badly Crippled
A crippled and tragic "Queen of
the Skies," the U.S.S. Akron, moved
toward San Francisco last night. The
giant air liner was expected tu ar
rive over the bay area about mid
night and to moor at the Sunnyvale
Naval Air Station at dawn this
morning.
The Akron cast off from Camp

( Kearny yesterday morning at 11:40
! a.m., for the journey north. More
; than a third of her supply of 6,500,-
000 cubic feet of helium had been
! exhausted in her heroic battles with
thunder and lightning storms, sand-
I storms in Texas, and in her abor
i tive attempt to land at Camp Kearny
' Wednesday morning, when two navy
enlisted men were killed in attempt-
I ing to bring her to earth.
Drop 23 of Crew
The loss of the helium, with con
! sequent lessening of lifting power,
j necessitated dropping twenty-two
enlisted men and two officers from
I her crew of eighty, and she was
; manned on the northward journey
by fifty-six men. She carried 4000
! gallons of gasoline and 4000 gallons
j of water ballast taken aboard at San
! Diego on her unscheduled stop there.
Just before the ship departed from
j Camp Kearny her skipper, Lieu
i tenant Commander Rosendahl, said
i he would fly up the coast and would
not fiy over any cities. But as the
j giant dirigible passed Long Beach
! she was met by a big plane carrying
1 Los Angeles city officials.
