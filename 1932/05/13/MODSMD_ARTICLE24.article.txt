\\ halever else il may have been, Ihe widely-heralded
cruise ol Ihe Akron to ils ne\y Sunnyvale base has scarcely
been a triumphal spring outing. Three days behind sched-I
ule, it is arriving at its destination after a terrible struggle j
with a storm of no more than ordinary intensity and with
the shadow of two deaths hanging over it.
'I he horrible landing attempt at ('amp Kearny Wednes
day demonstrated the fatal unwieldiness of these big gas i
bags lor practical purposes. Weather conditions appar
ently were not unduly bad, yet an unexpected air current'
threw everything into contusion and caused the deaths of
two members of the landing crew.
I his was not the first instance in which the dirigible has,
had serious trouble in landing or taking off. While trying j
to gel away from the Lakchurst hangar some time ago the I
Akron was caught by a gust of wind and swung around I
violently, damaging the tail tin and rear end of the bag.
The history of lighter than air craft is anything but
savory, rivaling that of submarine for frequency of <1 is-1
asters. Three I'nited States dirigibles have crashed or |
burned, rc 'ling in complete destruction and loss of many;
lives. The Shenandoah was the only one of these wrecked
in this country, but two others, ordered by the government
from England and Italy, were lost on their iirst trials.
Navy officials may be satisfied with the Akron, but to
Ihe lay eye that craft begins to look like a Frankenstein!
monster of whiie elephantine proportions. Fresh evidence
indicates that it is no more trustworthy than its predeces
sors; its war-time uses must necessarily be limited and i
fraught with danger to its crew, and it will be hard to con
vince the oppressed fax payers that it is worth the cost of
its construction and upkeep. «
