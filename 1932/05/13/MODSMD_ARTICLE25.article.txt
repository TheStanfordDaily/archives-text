# NEW WORLD'S RECORDS?

### 
Fresno is world-famous for ils raisins. Only once an-1
nually, about this time of year, is this business of raisin-j
growing crowded into the shadow by another activity, and
then only for a day. It is the day of the West ('oast Relays,!
which the little valley town some 1()0 miles to the south j
has built up to a peak of track excellence approached in I
no other relay carnival in the world today.
Last year Stanford entered the meet knowing that it had
no chance of victory against the strong teams from the!
south, U.S.C. and L.A.A.C,. Hut Farm fans who travelled
the Hid miles southward to Fresno will never regret having
done it, for they were rewarded with the rare privilege of)
seeing a new world mark established. More than that, of
seeing their own team chalk up a new mile relay record in
the phenomenal lime of iÂ»m 112.(i5.
That is the thrill of a Fresno relay meet. Anything is
likely to happen on that fast track, in the warm, still eve
ning of perfect racing conditions. Existing world's pole j
vault, mile relay, and 110-yard relay marks were made
there, and there the 100-yard dash record has been equal-
Who knows what marks may fall tomorrow evening?
