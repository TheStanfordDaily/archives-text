Pan Hellenic's program of exchange dinners among so
rority houses, dormant for the greater part of this year,
will be readopted next week.
Four houses, on their own initiative, are at present
working on arrangements whereby ten women from one
house will be the guests of another sorority, while ten
women from the second house will replace them in their
own group. The number has been arbitrarily set at ten to
avoid an onslaught of women from a larger group upon
the (lining room accommodations of a smaller one.
The plan, sponsored by Pan Hellenic representatives
last year, was discontinued because, in some cases, it had
nol proved satisfactory. This admitted failure reveals the
deplorable state of inter-house co-operation.
Because a woman has chosen to wear the pin of a par
ticular group, there is no reason why she should so com
pletely lose contact with the others. One of the prevailing
arguments against sororities on a campus as small as this!
one is Ihi ,leaking up of friendships, formed during the
trcshman year in Roble, as soon as the sophomore class
moves up Ihe Row.
With the exception of Ihe NY.A.A. banquets, the annual
A.\Y.S. installation dinner, and Ihe Conference parties, the
".">OO ' have no opportunities for informal social contact. A
system of exchange dinners, if agreed to whole heartedly
by Ihe entire Pan Hellenic group, need not lake more time
Iban Ihe dinner hour, does nol necessitate extensvie pre
paration and, il resumed, would be a forward step towards
better inter-sororilv relations.
