Some giant intellect made a start

! He found out that it one holds a
i match between the thumb and
forefinger, strikes it several times
on some hard, rough surface, and
i then places the resultant small
! flame in some dry hay—a larger
! flame will be produced. The cata
clysmic stupendosity of the dis
| covery will .shake the campus—with
; disgusted laughter.
Perhaps, also, these dauntless ex
j plorers for the truth also proved
that a fire will cause campus fire
| engines to move with halting fero
city to the scene —their purpose
j being to extinguish the larger flame
which we remember was caused by
| the smaller flame. The torch, of sci
j entific glory was passed from Aris
totle to Galileo, to Newton, to Ein
stein, and now from the "creator
of relativity" to the hay-burners.
There is a certain primitive love
for fire in each of us. Most of us
fulfilled that inner craving at the
kitchen stove long before we en
tered high school. The annual bon
fire should satisfy any hangover.
And for those that are still un
satiated in their lust for fire, pipe
smoking with its perpetual lighting
of matches is a solution. Yet, with
all these, somebody or somebodies
feel compelled to light an innocent
little hay-stack. After all, hay is
such a mundane thing. Who could
derive any real pleasure from see
ing it crackle for a few seconds?

SIMPLE THINGS FOR SIMPLE PEOPLE

I Although il must be admitted that
watching the fire apparatus strug
gle up the gruelling Lasuen grade
I does give one a little joy—a little
I pathetic joy.
Eut pleasure must step aside when
i expenses enter. They always do.
s Every time a hay-stack is turned by
I somebody's match into black ashes
i and gray smoke, the Student Body
automatically becomes about $35
! poorer. That is expensive pleasure
| —especially since only a few can
: watch the fire. To spend $35 of
I other people's money for one's own
I simple pleasure is not only some
l what foolish but quite unfair. If
i some student reeking with fire in-
I stinct and wealth as well wishes
! the pleasure of inhaling hay smoke,
' I feel sure that he can indulge that
! pleasure—providing, of course, he
will pay for calling the fire equip
j ment in advance as well as for the
j destroyed embryo horse-feed.
! The individuals, however, who
j merely exercise the childish pero
i gative indiscriminately are robbing
i the Student Body of always valu
| able dollars, and in depression
| times, precious dollars as well. Re
! member the Administration does
! not foot the bill; the students PAY.
! Furthermore, those caught firing
j hay piles will grace the "new gates"
by permanently passing through
i them. For your future stay here and
I for the pocketbook of the A.S.S.U.,
will not you seekers after truth de
sist? —Abe Mellinkoff

And for those that are still un
satiated in their lust for fire, pipe
smoking with its perpetual lighting
of matches is a solution. Yet, with
all these, somebody or somebodies
feel compelled to light an innocent
little hay-stack. After all, hay is
such a mundane thing. Who could
derive any real pleasure from see
ing it crackle for a few seconds?
