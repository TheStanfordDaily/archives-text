Anyplace in Germany
Mine dere countrymen:
Ach, vot gift's lots of revolution
and armies of young hopefuls poli
ticianing all over the place. But first
we needs must tell you about Italy,
which was our last stop. People sel
dom go directly from Italy to Ger- j
many, possibly because of climatic |
changes, and possibly bccause of
European geography. But we man- i
aged nicely, thank you.
One of the most intei'esting things j
we saw in sunny Italia was a statue I
which made us realize that the !
country is not so far behind the •
times. The statue was of Marcus j
Aurelius, who, as you doubtless j
know, was the winner of the I
women's marathon swim in the last \
Olympic Games. It is quite an old- j
looking statue, but we'd been '
warned that things age rapidly in j
this climate, so it's all right and we i
feel sure that the statue is genuine. I
A very strange guide showed
us around in the Eternal City,
and every once in a while he
brought up something about the
sacking of Rome, which was
evidently an important histori- I
eal event. It must have been a
long time ago. As far as we
could make out from what he
said, a hunch of Gauls came
down and put the Romans in
sacks and carried them away.
Be sure and put that down as
"something to remember." We

didn't know burlap was in
vented such a great while ago.
We'd always been interested in
that little jingle, "In 1492 Columbus
sailed the deep blue sea," so we
went down and looked around
Genoa for a while. It's just like
any other crowded city here, but
| we learned one thing—that Colum
bus had one deaf ear and when the
sailors wanted to mutiny he turned
it toward them and kept on. Enuff
of Genoa.
Venice is a fine, homelike place,
and reminded us strangely of Lagu
nita on a warm spring day, with
J plenty of mosquitoes and evcry
thing. Of course they eat all the
frogs in their canals before they're
big enough to croak. (A canal,

Cuthbert, is a long straight ditch
filled with water and drawn by a
mule. Gondolas are sometimes sub
stituted.)
Venice had so much trouble
with its government that even
Willy Shakespeare commented
on it. Finally, they instituted
the spoils system, whereby the
government had to take care of
its own garbage. Commoners
still use the open-the-window
and - into - the - creek method,
though.
We had hoped to stop in the Al
pine foothills and get a look at those
two famous volcanos, Sodom and
Gomorrah, but time was short, so
we had to be satisfied with looking
at the place where Brutus led his
fleet over the Alps.
So here we are, a string of
pretzels around our neck and
foam frothing all over the place.
(There is sea foam, too, Mr. Vol
stead.) The atmosphere is al
most unbeerably homesickening.
A fellow-traveler was telling us
this morning about a custom they
used to have here of making people
who were accused of a crime stick
their arms in the fire for two or
three days. The one that came out
cleanest was not guilty. It is still
supposed to be the best remedy
known for sticky fingers.
Before we started, the Pub
lications Council made out a
cute lit tie budget for us, but
it doesn't allow much spending
in Germany. So this afternoon
we plan to hire a canoe and go
hunting for the Lorelei. That
shouldn't cost much, and may
do something for our well
known pulse, which is getting
a little slow.
tearfully, —W.
