Colonel Charles Lindbergh and Mrs. Anne Lindbergh
were grief-stricken yesterday as a result of the discovery
near their Hopewell estate of the dead body of their kid
napped son, Charles Jr. The announcement of the baby's
death came soon after it had been said by high officials that
negotiations were being made near the Virginia coast for
the return of the kidnaped child. It was rumored that these
negotiations had been hampered by the activities of Al
Caponc's lieutenants.
