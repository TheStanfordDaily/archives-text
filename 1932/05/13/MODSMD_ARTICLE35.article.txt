IF YOU WANT TO PI T in a
thoroughly enjoyable afternoon,
as well as help the Olympic
Games fund, come out and watch
Johnny McKelvey go after the
peerless and now professional
Mr. VVeismuller's 50-yard rec- i
ord.
McKelvey has been cracking the j
record all week, and if he doesn't
get stage fright and park on the
side of the tank when the gun goes
off, should shatter it tomorrow. He :
will probably be paced by Ted j
Wiget and Tuppy Gardner, who are j
not so slow on their own hook.
This meet will not be all Stanford j
by any means. The L.A.A.C., ;
L.A.J.C., Olympic Club, and the In- j
dians are all entered in the Class A
championships, and they all have
premier performers listed under
their respective banners.
YE SPORTS ED, who is one of
the plutocrats of the campus, and
knows the ponies as if he owned
them, hastens to warn the sporting
element of the Farm that they have j
only today and tomorrow to give :
their bank accounts a big shove by ,
taking Polydorus to place second, i
And if that doesn't finish them there I
will be another stake schedule next j
fall.
And speaking of horses, there
are polo matches coming up
with Oregon State next Thurs
day and Saturday that promise
to he first-class exhibitions. If
yon aren't a polo fan now, come
out and watch these matches and |
you will he. They are the fastest
and trickiest things that a horse
has a chance to perform in.
Boxing is certainly popular with |
bay city fans, what with Max Baer j
fighting one after another of the !
boys from the East who come West j
for the air and a vacation in Sunny j
California, Divodi meeting Paulie j
Walker, and a Corbett-Whitehead I
match in the offing.
Fighting may be a great game,
but until they match their
fighters like Harry Maloney
does his—even weight and even
ability—we can't see it. The
idea of handing over good money }
to see one pachyderm dust off
another for five or six rounds
before polishing him off is just
too much for our constitution.
The little fellows who fight in
the small clubs are about the
only ones who stand toe-to-toe
and scrap. —Iiob Wade

Johnny McKelvey go after the
peerless and now professional
Mr. VVeismuller's 50-yard rec- i
ord.
McKelvey has been cracking the j
record all week, and if he doesn't
get stage fright and park on the
side of the tank when the gun goes
off, should shatter it tomorrow. He :
will probably be paced by Ted j
Wiget and Tuppy Gardner, who are j
not so slow on their own hook.
This meet will not be all Stanford j
by any means. The L.A.A.C., ;
L.A.J.C., Olympic Club, and the In- j
dians are all entered in the Class A
championships, and they all have
premier performers listed under
their respective banners.
YE SPORTS ED, who is one of
the plutocrats of the campus, and
knows the ponies as if he owned
them, hastens to warn the sporting
element of the Farm that they have j
only today and tomorrow to give :
their bank accounts a big shove by ,
taking Polydorus to place second, i
And if that doesn't finish them there I
will be another stake schedule next j
fall.
And speaking of horses, there
are polo matches coming up
with Oregon State next Thurs
day and Saturday that promise
to he first-class exhibitions. If
yon aren't a polo fan now, come
out and watch these matches and |
you will he. They are the fastest
and trickiest things that a horse
has a chance to perform in.
Boxing is certainly popular with |
bay city fans, what with Max Baer j
fighting one after another of the !
boys from the East who come West j
for the air and a vacation in Sunny j
California, Divodi meeting Paulie j
Walker, and a Corbett-Whitehead I
match in the offing.
Fighting may be a great game,
but until they match their
fighters like Harry Maloney
does his—even weight and even
ability—we can't see it. The
idea of handing over good money }
to see one pachyderm dust off
another for five or six rounds
before polishing him off is just
too much for our constitution.
The little fellows who fight in
the small clubs are about the
only ones who stand toe-to-toe
and scrap. —Iiob Wade
