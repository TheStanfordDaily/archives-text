# MONDAY PRACTICE TO DECIDE CHANCE DE POLO QUARTET
## Bruce Fleming Will Enter First Hard Workout Since Injury 
### 
Next Monday's polo scrimmage
may decide whether or not the
Card riders stand an even chance
against the invading Oregon Staters
on May 19-21. Captain Bruce Flem
ing, who pulled a jockey muscle
three weeks ago, will be out for his
first practice since his injury on
Monday.
If Fleming finds that he is in con
dition to last through a six-chukker
game, then the Hedshirts should be
able to top the Beavers. But il his
injury can't stand the gaff the whole
Stanford team will have to be re
vamped.
Should Fleming be unable to
play, Rufe Spalding will probably
be shifted back to Fleming's num
ber four defense position. Spalding
[ regularly plays at number two, but
| can play a fairly good defensive
j game if called upon.
Woody Melone is likely to get the
call for Spalding's number two
berth. Melone is first in the line of
substitutes, and plays a fast game,
but his shooting ability in no way
compares to Spalding's. But even
j Melone isn't in first-rate condition,
I being bothered somewhat by a leg
! injury.
With reports from Corvallis all
telling of a flashy, high-speed team,
I prospects look none too promising
I for an Indian win. In the last two
! years Stanford has downed the
northern riders, but this time Ore
gon State has a good chance to
I break the string of victories.
