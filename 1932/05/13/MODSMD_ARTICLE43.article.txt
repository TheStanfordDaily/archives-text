Just as in the 1500 and 5000 meter |
races, the Finnish 10,000 meter dele- ;
gation is heavily favored to take all
competition in the Olympic Games
this summer. They should also be I
strong contenders for the marathon
title.
There are so many good Finns in j
the long distances that they stand ,
a good chance to wear themselves j
out trying out for positions on the :
national team. Iso-Hollo, Nurmi, j
and Loukola seem to be the best at i
10,000 meters, and each one of the j
three should finish in the money at i
Los Angeles. The Finns fear Kuso- \
cinski, the Polish champion, and j
they are right in doing so. Although
Nurmi holds the record for the dis- !
tance, at 30.06.2, his best 1931 mark j
was 31:19.2, not quite as good as j
Iso-Hollo's 30:51.4, Syring of Ger- |
many has done 31:20.8, and Lou- '

i kola (the 3,000-meter steeplechase
! champion) has done 31:12.
j Classic race of all Olympic com
! petition, the Marathon has always
I provided the greatest popular ap-
I peal. More than in any other event,
i dark horses have come through in
| this gruelling 26-mile cross country
j to add to the Marathon legend and
| tradition. In the first and original
| race, from Marathon to Athens, a
J Greek runner carried tidings of a
| battle and fell dead when lie had
i delivered his message. In 1896, Si-
| mon Loues, running his first race
j in competition, defeated the skilled
I champions of the rest of the world.
Even in the 1928 race, the unex
; pected victory of El Ouafi, giving
France its first flat race victory of
the Amsterdam games, was the big
-1 gest thrill of the whole program.

Paavo Nurmi and Willie Ritola
of Finland have never entered an
official Marathon race, but the fact
that they have decided to enter this
test instead of the 5000 meters is
mute evidence that they will be
strong contenders. William Agee
(United States) has turned in the
fastest time since 1928, 2:32.3, but
has slowed up badly since then.
James Hennigan has already quali
fied for the American Olympic team
by placing second to De Bruyn of
Germany in the Boston Marathon.

year.

that they have decided to enter this

Just as in the 1500 and 5000 meter |
races, the Finnish 10,000 meter dele- ;
gation is heavily favored to take all
competition in the Olympic Games
this summer. They should also be I
strong contenders for the marathon
title.
There are so many good Finns in j
the long distances that they stand ,
a good chance to wear themselves j
out trying out for positions on the :
national team. Iso-Hollo, Nurmi, j
and Loukola seem to be the best at i
10,000 meters, and each one of the j
three should finish in the money at i
Los Angeles. The Finns fear Kuso- \
cinski, the Polish champion, and j
they are right in doing so. Although
Nurmi holds the record for the dis- !
tance, at 30.06.2, his best 1931 mark j
was 31:19.2, not quite as good as j
Iso-Hollo's 30:51.4, Syring of Ger- |
many has done 31:20.8, and Lou- '
