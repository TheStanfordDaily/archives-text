WASHINGTON. May 12. </P) —A ;
titanic compromise federal relief |
program was tentatively agreed <
upon today by President Hoover, I
Congressional leaders of both par- i
ties, and government financial ex- !
perts.
It involved doubling the borrow- :
ing power of the Reconstruction i
Finance Corporation, to a total of
$3,000,000,000 with the additional J
$1,500,000,000 to be used for loans ;
to states for unemployment, relief !
and to promote public and private j
construction.
The two-billion dollar bond issue
advocated by Senator Robinson, of j
Arkansas, the Democratic leader, j
was used as the basis for the com- j
promise on the greatest peace time j
emergency relief project in the na- |
tion's history.
The agreement came out of a con
ference between President Hoover }
and Senator Robinson, who only
yesterday advanced his bond issue
idea in the Senate.
Developments were quick and
fast. Before calling in Robinson, the
President consulted at breakfast
with Senator Watson, of Indiana, the
majority chieftain, on the relief j
problem which it was agreed must
be met by the government in some j
manner before adjournment is
taken.
