# ALUMNI RAISE DUES FOR FUND TO HELP ENTERING STUDENTS
## 
### 
In order to aid the student unable |
to matriculate at Stanford on ac- j
count of the high tuition of recent |
years, the Alumni Council has voted >
unanimously to raise alumni dues !
from $3 to $4 a year. The fund real- j
ized will go to the forming of a
scholarship fund and provision for \
loans to needy students.
The tentative plan, modeled after
that in force in several other univer- i
sities, provides for aid in case of (1) '
financial need; (2) a good scholastic \
record; (3) character, ambition, and
demonstrated qualities of leadership.
The appeal of the Council appears [
in the May issue of the Illustrated j
Review, which is being sent to all |
seniors. Pamphlets are being mailed j
by the Alumni Secretary to alumni i
who do not subscribe to the Illus- i
trated Review.
