### 
Putting up what physicians de
| clared to be a remarkable fight for
j life, Jack Stratton, '32, victim of an
auto wreck on the highway near
Dinah's shack Wednesday night, was
only slightly improved last night, '
Palo Alto hospital attendants re- |
ported. He is still in grave danger, j
however, with a badly fractured,
i skull and severe lacerations,
j Ralph Giberson, '32, track star, is j
recovering satisfactorily, although it j
j is doubtful he will be able to com
i pete again this year. He is suffering !
| from a slight concussion of the brain, 1
a cut forehead, and a badly skinned
' back, and may have a slight skull j
jfracture.
Charles Irons, '34, also involved I
in the accident, received only minor I
injuries, and was discharged from i
the hospital Wednesday night.
The accident occurred when Gib- |
erson, driving a Ford roadster, was
forced to swing from the pavement j
to miss a car ahead. When he tried !
to turn back again the wheels ap- (
parently locked and the car rolled j
completely over, throwing the three |
students on their heads.
Dr. Blake C. Wilbur, who treated |
the three victims, said that Stratton
was in wonderful physical condition, I
and that it was only phenomenal!
vitality that kept him alive longer j
I than a lew minutes.
