### 
TOKYO, May 16—(Monday). (/I 3 ) j
—Premier Suyoshi Inukai died j
shortly before midnight from bullet
wounds inflicted by assassin mem- j
bcrs of a group of military terror- i
ists who were responsible lor a se- '
ries of bombings carried out at the |
very moment the premier was at- j
tacked.
Bombs were exploded at the office ;
of the Metropolitan Police Board,
the Bank of Japan, the headquarters I
of the Seiyukai (government) party J
and the home of the Lord Keeper of j
the Privy Seal.
At 2:00 o'clock this morning a hur- I
ried ceremony was held in the Pal- j
ace and the powers of government |
were transferred to Korekiyo Taka- j
hashi, who has been serving as
finance minister. Mr. Takahashi was |
appointed acting premier.
The assassinated premier, who
was 77 years old, died at 11:25 p.m.,
almost exactly six hours after he
was shot. He was the second head
of a state to succumb to an assassin's
bullet within a period of ten days, i
March 6 President Paul Doumer of
France was killed in the same man- (
ner.
After the outburst of terrorism,
which climaxed a long series of po
litical crimes including an attack on l
the life o|" the emperor himself,
eighteen men, each wearing an army j
or naval officer's uniform, surren- |
dered to the police.
In the office of the Metropolitan
Police Board the bombers left a
handbill, signed by the "Young j
Army and Navy Officers' Associa- j
tion," in which they bitterly con- •
demned the present state of the po- j
litical parties, the conduct of the .
nation's diplomacy, and the govern- j
ment's policies in the field of eco- !
nomics and education.
