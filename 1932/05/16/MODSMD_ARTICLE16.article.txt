# PHOEBE FINISHES FIRST IN FRACAS FOR FAST FROGS
## 
### 
Phoebe Frog of Sequoia
crashes through.
Versatile Sequoia again dis
played its claim to supremacy
last week, when Warren S.
Gage of Elk Grove and Sequoia
Hall entered a pet frog in a
frog-jumping contest held at
Ballarat, California.
Totally lacking in the reti
cance which characterizes the
Stanford female, Phoebe step
ped right out in front and cap
tured first place in the con
test. Jumping along at a merry
clip, amidst throaty cheers
from the local boys, Gage's
frog carried on the tradition of
Mark Twain's famous animal.
Phoebe's victory was doubly
spectacular, in view of the fact
that she defeated the proteges
of all the rural miners and
prospectors, who had been
confident of the laurels.
