# KAGAN'S OPERA WELL DONE BY STELLAR CAST
## Engleman, Jamison, And Wheeler Oustanding In "Two's Company" 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Before an audience which threw
only five pennies and one thin dime
(the bloated plutocrat!), the Stan
| lord Dramatic Council presented the
j 1932 Junior Opera, "Two's Com
; pany," Saturday night in the Assem
' bly Hall, under Harold Helvenston's
| direction.
Ben Kagan's "comedy with music"
was pretty largely just that—in the
I literal sense. The affair was simply
a series of gags—mostly old—strung
! together on a string of good and bad
: tunes.
I Now it is a well-known fact that
1 operas have little plot, but after all,
Mr. Kagan! There is a point beyond
I which!
First Act Good
Starting out with a good first act
! which introduced the possibility of a
| perfectly good plot, with several in
| teresting the play pe
| tered off into a three-act parade of
! g'igs and situations. In the begin-
I ning there was a hero, heroine, a
| menace, a failing show which need
i ed rescuing, and a Grade A shooting
I —and nothing came of it all!
Considered alone, the second act
j was the best part of the show, and
; a unit in itself. In fact, it was such
j a good act that one wonders why
| the Powers bothered with the rest
of the show at all. Why not call it a
i revue and let it go at that?
The third act, done against a back
| ground of an interestingly executed
set, was inexcusable. It was a caba
j ret scene and served only to get the
1 entire cast on the crowded stage,
| and bring about the happy ending,
|to the tune of a good song: ''The
| Whole World Over, Two's Com
i pany."
Eph Fugleman's Show
The opera was Eph Engleman's
show almost from start to finish; he
| was the center of every scene in
I which he appeared, always himself,
| always at ease, and always funny,
j His lines, his ad-libbing (which, we
j suspect, was considerable), his sing
j ing, and his gestures—all were liter
! ally the life of the show.
Kay Wheeler, next to Engleman,
j was the most natural member of the
j company. Her pep, charm, and
| clever dancing and reading of lines
i made her outstanding.
Jamison Poised
Jamison wore her clothes well,
j displaying the greatest poise of any
jof the cast. Her voice, though pleas-
I ing and of good tonal quality, seems
J to lack the vivacity to put over such
j a song as "I've Got a One-Track
j Mind," sung in Act Two.
William Mahu had little to do and
j did it well. His singing in the third
j act with Jamison of "The Whole
| World Over, Two's Company," was
excellent.
I Mary Anita Loos and Paul Van
| Deusen did a cake walk in the sec
j ond act that easily deserved the
! large hand it drew. Though Miss
i Loos seemed uncomfortable in her
i first scene, straining too hard to pro
| ject her voice, she was splendid in
| her dance.
Elston a "Natural"'
Virginia Elston is a "natural" if
| ever there was one. She was ter
! ribly funny when seemingly trying
| the least to be so, drawing a laugh
]on every entrance and on every
i exit. Her listless attitude and her
J lifeless speech proved her to be
| first-rate in the Zasu Pitts type of
i comedy.
The rest of the players were ade-
I quate, except Jack Redhead, who
| pulled the world's feeblest drunk
I scene (or perhaps we're not a judge),
I and as a comedian was a total loss.
Terrence Geddis, Beulah Dimmitt,
land Harold David filled their small
j parts well.
j The specialty numbers in Act Two
j were very good, notably Engleman's
! violin solo, which actually threw a
hush over the entire house. Roger
[Sumner pleased with his accordion
j solo, as did Judy Wilson with her
I dance number. The chorus was sat
i isfying, excepl in the "Shadows'"'
1 number, which was marred by lack
| of co-ordination.
