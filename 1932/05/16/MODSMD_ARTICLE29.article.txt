Pan Hellenic, traditional target of Daily editorial jibes,
lias lormulaled a list of ten regulations for next year's rush
in.H season. Willi their nsuAi foresight and perspicacity,
the representatives from the nine sorority houses coneen-
I rated their attention upon the least important items on the
list <>l suggestions made by the outgoing sponsors this win
ter, and completely disregarded the one point urged most
by the sponsorial group.
Regulations regarding offers of financial aid, summer
rushing, and the length of a sponsor's stay in Ruble were
to be expected. They are the traditional meat of all Pan
Hellenic (.ouncils. Rut the one suggestion that promised a
strain on the conservative tradition of the Row was vetoed.
I he suggestion that freshman women be allowed to return
to Roble unaccompanied by Row women does not figure
on the list of regulations passed last week.
For many reasons this suggestion should have been
carefully considered and given a fair trial. The present
custom of conducting women back to Roble has several
markedly bad effects. It provides the opportunity sine
(/tut non for illegal rushing. An unexpected turn down a
longer road to Roble, the appeal of a borrowed car, an
ingenious pep talk- and the freshman who was close to
making a decision is thrown back upon her old doubts and
perplexities.
Last of ;ill, the system results in difficulties for the
houses themselves. When sorority members are seen night
alter night !h a woman they fail to pledge, pride and
prestige suffer ;i temporary set-back, and campus whisper
ing wires buz/.
1 he practice of saying goodbye to freshman women
upon the steps of the sorority houses at a definite hour
would eliminate all these evils and lead to a saner, less
emotional decision when pledge night comes around.
