Stanford, home of the winds of freedom, lias slowly
and reluctantly released her hold on the restrictions bind
ing women students and their social activities. Since the
days o!' Mrs. Stanford and her limitation on feminine en
rollment, late leaves have been increased in number and
the dead line for riotous dissipation has been set farther
and farther hack into the hours of morning.

unlimited number of midweek 2:.'SO o'clock leaves per

The regulations were planned to gradually lessen re
strictions from the freshman year to later years in the Uni
versity. Freshman women, coming from the comparative
conservatism of high school are apt to be swept off their
feet by the social opportunities of a university. If reason
urges this step, it should also speak for a further lessening
of restrictions in the senior year.
Senior women, tied down to a limited number of late
leaves, upon graduation are thrown upon a world which
in itself places no restrictions upon their activities. This
gap should he bridged, just as that from high school to
college is bridged. There is no reason why an unlimited
number of late leaves should not be granted to seniors at
least in their last two quarters here.
