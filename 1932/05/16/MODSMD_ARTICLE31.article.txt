Willi the news that Women's Conference is considering
the substitution of women hashers in sorority houses for
the traditional hashing rough, another campus institution
seems threatened with destruction.
Altruistic though the proposition may seem at first
glance, it is very improbable that it would work out in
practice. For a number of reasons, it is to be hoped that
the new idea represents an emergency move and not an
impending custom.
From a purely aesthetic point of view, a white jacketed
rough adds piquancy to a dining room, while an aproned,
toiling sister does not. Furthermore, men who hoist trays
along the Row are often chosen for brains, activities, and
campus prominence. Half the ideal Stanford marriages
may be traced to hasher-sorority romances.
A student house manager would have no effective blud
geon to wield over the heads of recalcitrant hashers if they
were members of the house and, women being fashioned
as they are, the house mother's disciplinary task would be
tremendously increased. The latest bit of gossip that had
to be relayed across the dining room or whispered in the
ear of a coffee slinging sister would result in a situation
directly opposed to the dignity and poise prevalent under
the present regime.
