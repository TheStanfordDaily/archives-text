# CAT SESSION
## ROUGH OR MOUSE? 
### 
The Rough tradition on the Farm
fraternal is a splendid one, ranking
in vast amounts of publicity and
journalistic embroidery second only
to (he "500." The rough is a vigor
ous male, indolent in his campus
clothes, immaculate in tuxedo, full
of humor and above average intelli
gence.
But nothing offers more convinc
ing evidence that the Rough is
wrongly named than to observe his
captivating manners at a jolly-up.
Preferably a Ruble jolly-up. For
the condition is not so violent along
the smaller living rooms of the Row,
whereas to Roble, that cradle of
humanity, the Rough throngs en
masse, and makes himself so defi
nitely an inert bulk upon the hands
of any dance committee, that Stan
ford boors, sheep, liars, morons,
bashful white mice, and insufferable
snobs, are the current substitutions
for the once-pleasurable name of
the Rough.
To those who have seen it, the
graphic picture of a good jolly-up
is one of men lined three deep
around Roble lobby—men from En
cina, Branner, Toyon, Sequoia, and
the fraternities—men standing, and
standing.
Whether it is old wives' curiosity,
psychological inhibitions, or wrong
sense of direction that leads them
to Roble is hard to decide. Appar

| ently it is not the wish to be
j friendly, investigate the women face
j to face, nor enjoy a turn with the
music.
Introducing-committees find it
hard slugging. Won't you let me
bring you someone to dance with?
! No, no, a flash of horror seen en
passant on a vapid, firm-jawed
face. No, they will not dance. They
have sore heels. They have just fin
ished dancing. They are looking for
[ someone. They have to leave in a
! minute. Or, grinning, "No, nuh-uh,
! you can't get me stuck with any
1 sour dame."
| At fall jolly-ups, there is the lure
jof undiscovered freshman women,
! and the rough feels ambition to
; dance, though he rarely pursues it.
; But by spring quarter, any woman
| who has not already captured a
I transient campus-wide name must
I therefore be unpopular and poison
ous, and to be avoided by complete
| lethargy.
The statistics are staggering.
Three hundred men found the mus
[ cular power to get across the cam
pus to Roble lobby for last week's
jolly-up. Forty-five only of Roble's
230 women found the bravery to
come downstairs, knowing before
hand that the five potential male
dancers would be scarcely enough
to go around. —Collier Connell.

Three hundred men found the mus

pus to Roble lobby for last week's
jolly-up. Forty-five only of Roble's

dancers would be scarcely enough
to go around. —Collier Connell.
The Rough tradition on the Farm
fraternal is a splendid one, ranking
in vast amounts of publicity and
journalistic embroidery second only
to (he "500." The rough is a vigor
ous male, indolent in his campus
clothes, immaculate in tuxedo, full
of humor and above average intelli
gence.
But nothing offers more convinc
ing evidence that the Rough is
wrongly named than to observe his
captivating manners at a jolly-up.
Preferably a Ruble jolly-up. For
the condition is not so violent along
the smaller living rooms of the Row,
whereas to Roble, that cradle of
humanity, the Rough throngs en
masse, and makes himself so defi
nitely an inert bulk upon the hands
of any dance committee, that Stan
ford boors, sheep, liars, morons,
bashful white mice, and insufferable
snobs, are the current substitutions
for the once-pleasurable name of
the Rough.
To those who have seen it, the
graphic picture of a good jolly-up
is one of men lined three deep
around Roble lobby—men from En
cina, Branner, Toyon, Sequoia, and
the fraternities—men standing, and
standing.
Whether it is old wives' curiosity,
psychological inhibitions, or wrong
sense of direction that leads them
to Roble is hard to decide. Appar

| ently it is not the wish to be
j friendly, investigate the women face
j to face, nor enjoy a turn with the
music.
Introducing-committees find it
hard slugging. Won't you let me
bring you someone to dance with?
