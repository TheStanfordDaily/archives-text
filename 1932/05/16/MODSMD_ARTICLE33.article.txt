### 
GRAND HOTEL—At the California
Theatre, Sail* Francisco.
Vicki Baum's great story has scored
another sensation. Any play with
such a cast is a sensation, but
"Grand Hotel" is the first drama
capable of adequately supporting
so many notables.
The great Garbo in her former
roles has merely been rehearsing for
the part of "Grusinskaya." She is
lovely. John Barrymore is a gallant
and irresistible "von Geigern"; Joan
Crawford, a strange and exotic sten
ographer to the villain "Preysing"
whose character is powerfully pre
sented by Wallace Beery.
Lionel Barrymore as the invalid
"Kringelein" does a masterly bit of
character work despite the fact that
the resulting character is a Barry
more-"Kringelein."
"Grand Hotel," as a novel, is mel
ancholy—as a play, sombre but fast
moving—as a motion picture, gayer,
more human, and somewhat slower
because of the close-ups; close-ups
which are not a detraction but
rather a means of more intimately
presenting a series of fascinating
characters simultaneously registered
at the Grand Hotel.
To miss this picture is to lose the
maraschino cherry you've saved un
til the last! ' —E.E.H.
THE WORLD AND THE FLESH—
At the Varsity Theatre.
Big, old he-man George Bancroft
this time comes through with a
Hollywood version of the Russian
Revolution and once again proves
that love conquers all.
The plot is a mixed-up affair in
which Bancroft, a sailor leader in
the revolution, is- either capturing
escaping aristocrats with the aid of
his trusty band of sailors or else

being brutally lashed and mis
treated by the aforementioned blue
bloods. Miriam Hopkins does very
well as the famous dancer with
whom Bancroft is in love—both in
her acting and in being beautiful.
Just as all seems lost, the trusty
sailors turn up and all ends happily
as they burst into song.
As for the shorts, one is worse
than most and the other is better
than most, so it rather evens things
up. Also, theie are some good sports
shots in the news reel. —J.K.
THE WET PARADE—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Relating simply and tellingly the
story of two families—one northern
and one southern —and their ex
periences with prohibition, "The
Wet Parade" skillfully cloaks a defi
nite moral with a clever plot and
lots of human interest.
The same thing happens in each
family: the father is caught by, and
dies of, the drinking habit. And the
two families are linked by the mar
riage of the boy and girl, whose ex
periences have taught them to de
spise liquor.
Dorothy Jordan, as the southern
girl, displays one of the screen's
most charming personalities—bar
none. Her southern accent and her
natural manner arc captivating.
Robert Young, a newcomer, dis
plays ability and personality. Neil
Hamilton plays another of his ex
ceptionally good drunken roles in a
convincing manner. Walter Huston
and Lewis Stone, two splendid ac
tors, play the fathers of the fami
lies.
Myrna Loy appears briefly as the
siren, and Jimmy Durante is him
self again—always wise-cracking,
and a fine, sincere actor. —E.C.

sailors turn up and all ends happily
as they burst into song.
As for the shorts, one is worse
than most and the other is better
than most, so it rather evens things
up. Also, theie are some good sports
shots in the news reel. —J.K.
THE WET PARADE—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Relating simply and tellingly the
story of two families—one northern
and one southern —and their ex
periences with prohibition, "The
Wet Parade" skillfully cloaks a defi
nite moral with a clever plot and
lots of human interest.
The same thing happens in each
family: the father is caught by, and
dies of, the drinking habit. And the
two families are linked by the mar
riage of the boy and girl, whose ex
periences have taught them to de
spise liquor.
Dorothy Jordan, as the southern
girl, displays one of the screen's
most charming personalities—bar
none. Her southern accent and her
natural manner arc captivating.
Robert Young, a newcomer, dis
plays ability and personality. Neil
Hamilton plays another of his ex
ceptionally good drunken roles in a
convincing manner. Walter Huston
and Lewis Stone, two splendid ac
tors, play the fathers of the fami
lies.
Myrna Loy appears briefly as the
siren, and Jimmy Durante is him
self again—always wise-cracking,
and a fine, sincere actor. —E.C.
GRAND HOTEL—At the California
Theatre, Sail* Francisco.
Vicki Baum's great story has scored
another sensation. Any play with
such a cast is a sensation, but
"Grand Hotel" is the first drama
capable of adequately supporting
so many notables.
The great Garbo in her former
roles has merely been rehearsing for
the part of "Grusinskaya." She is
lovely. John Barrymore is a gallant
and irresistible "von Geigern"; Joan
Crawford, a strange and exotic sten
ographer to the villain "Preysing"
whose character is powerfully pre
sented by Wallace Beery.
Lionel Barrymore as the invalid
"Kringelein" does a masterly bit of
character work despite the fact that
the resulting character is a Barry
more-"Kringelein."
"Grand Hotel," as a novel, is mel
ancholy—as a play, sombre but fast
moving—as a motion picture, gayer,
more human, and somewhat slower
because of the close-ups; close-ups
which are not a detraction but
rather a means of more intimately
presenting a series of fascinating
characters simultaneously registered
at the Grand Hotel.
To miss this picture is to lose the
maraschino cherry you've saved un
til the last! ' —E.E.H.
THE WORLD AND THE FLESH—
At the Varsity Theatre.
Big, old he-man George Bancroft
this time comes through with a
Hollywood version of the Russian
Revolution and once again proves
that love conquers all.
The plot is a mixed-up affair in
which Bancroft, a sailor leader in
the revolution, is- either capturing
escaping aristocrats with the aid of
his trusty band of sailors or else

being brutally lashed and mis
treated by the aforementioned blue
bloods. Miriam Hopkins does very
well as the famous dancer with
whom Bancroft is in love—both in
her acting and in being beautiful.
Just as all seems lost, the trusty
sailors turn up and all ends happily
as they burst into song.
