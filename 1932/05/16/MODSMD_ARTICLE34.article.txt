England
Ah, the white cliffs of Dover—they
—ah—well anyway these people can
spikka da Englis without being
bribed, which is something. We have
finally arrived here after a hurried
trip through the rest of the Con
tinent, meaning principally France.
We did not find the Lorelei.
We did not find the Iron Maiden
(though what the devil good
would it have done us anyway?)
and we did not find the chateau
in the middle of France that our
dentist has been talking about
for fourteen years now.
Otherwise, the leas said about
France, the better. We particularly
loathe the idea of spoiling a good
time for anyone, and as far as we
can tell, everyone on the Farm is
going to pack up and move to
France this summer. What a dull
time they are going to have, all in
all. Of course, we were being strict
ly honorable and living according
to the Daily budget, while there,
and lhat may make a difference.
We spent some time in Paris
looking for 1 a bourgeoisie, on ac
count of having heard mention
of them in history hooks. But
it was Saturday and they had
them all put away to keep out
of the dust. They say they've
changed a lot since the Revo
lution. anyway. The bourgeoisie
used to be tradesmen, such as
professors, with very little
chance of ever becoming any
thing higher. But now, one
never knows, does one?
You know, this French Revolu
tion must have been a pretty gay
thing. A king who does everything
he says he will is an absolute mon
key. That was the King of France
all over. So they had a meeting and
formulated the Treaty of Utrecht,
which provided that the thrones of
France and Spain should never rest
in Ihe same bed. And then Ihey

handed their Absolute Monkey over
to the beefeaters.
At this point history becomes
a little confused, because we
have it on excellent authority
that the beefeaters lived in the
Tower of London and cooked for
Mary Queen of Scots. It is all
very confusing. Let us skip a
bit. over to modern England.
Lloyd George is the present king
of England. He is known in history
as George V. The premier was
Borah, but he resigned because too
many troubles arose before him,
making it impossible for him to get
around, rapidly. So they are just
waiting, now.
After we have seen a few
more cathedrals and cricket ,
lawns, and had a little more
port, we're sailing hack to the
States, by George (and God
save *iin!)
patriotically, —W.
