The Editor, Sir:
Friday evening, about 11:30 o'clock,
three fellows (roughs, if you pre
fer) whom the depression and
studies had kept plugging at their
books till 11, decided to go over and
see how their friends were faring
at the Encina informal dance that
was going on in the Women's Gym.
When they arrived, they found
about six or seven other fellows
loitering around the entrance, also
bent on seeing the dance. But no!
"The dance floor was too crowded
already." The roughs weren't to get
in at all.
Despite pleading and promises of
good behavior on the part of the
roughs, the police were adamant;
orders were orders. '"Who gives the
orders then?" asked the roughs,
"let's ask him." So the cops being
pretty good eggs summoned the
chairman of the dance committee
(a typical product of a prominent
San Francisco high school) who in
all the glory of biscuit-colored flan
nels, slick-backed hair, and his own
importance, flatly refused. As a
parting crack he poked his head out
the door (behind the protection of
the doorkeepers of course) and
smartly offered to sell bids to the
roughs for $1.50 per.
Granted that "smoothie" freshmen
chairmen of committees do get all
puffed up at their own grandeur,
nevertheless it wouldn't have hurt
to let those men in and I'd like to
make the following points:
(1) The dance floor was NOT
crowded. (Oh yes, we got in of
course, but it wasn't Mr. Beaubaire's
nor the cop's fault!)
(2) There was a gallery where
the roughs could have sat and seen
the dance, heard the orchestra, and
harmed no one.
(3) Most of the fellows didn't
want to dance anyhow, merely to
observe.
(4) When ALL the roughs did get
in at ten to one they didn't try to
cut nor did I see anyone annoyed
by them.
Practically all the points for and
against letting in roughs have been
given; all I am offering is the above
information about Friday night's
dance.
The prom is this Friday night.
Plenty of roughs or fellows haven't
$5. Are they going to let the roughs
in after 12 o'clock or
Paul Targhetta
P.S.: Oh yes, while we we were
hanging around the door trying to
get in the dance by normal means,
at least four couples of peninsula
shoe clerks and Redwood City
cuties were allowed to go in. The
point in this case being, that any
one who had a girl (ANYONE, with
any kind of a girl) could get in and
dance after 11 o'clock while fellows
who merely wanted to see the dance
were kept out.
