From the Land of Cherry BIos
;oms comes one of the greatest
•vomen athletes of all time, a Japa
lese Atlanta, Krunye Himtoni, who
lolds the world's records in the (>!)-
md 100- and 400-meter dashes, the
220-yard dash, the broad-jump with
i record of more than 20 feet, and
\chieved 38 feet 2 inches in the
lop-step-and-jump at Amsterdam.
She also placed second in the 800
neters in 1928 and tied for the
vvorld's mark in the 100-meter dash.
The strongest entrant for the 100-
neter event, probably the most im-
Dortant of women's track, will be
Betty Robinson of Northwestern
University, who won the race in
\msterdam in 12.5 seconds. Follow -
ng her return from abroad she was
breed to leave the athletic field
ifter being seriously injured in an
lirplane crash, but she has returned
o the track and is staging a strong
•omeback. The remaining places in
tier event were taken by Canadian
contenders in '28.

Canada will add beauty to its
contingent of feminine brawn with
Ethel Catherood, winner of a re
cent national beauty contest who
will surely compete in the high
jump and javelin events. This fair
athlete won the high jump at Am
sterdam, setting a new world's rec
ord of 5 feet 3 inches.

Held most difficult of all the
women's track events, the 880-
neter race will be run off this year
n spite of the catastrophe attend
ant to it in the 1928 Olympics, when

hree-fourths of the forty-five wom
?n who started the gruelling event
Droved all masculine contentions to
