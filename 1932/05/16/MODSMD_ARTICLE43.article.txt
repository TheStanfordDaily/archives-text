j Clashing in the first of the hard
I ball semi-finals championships, the
i Alpha Delts and Phi Kaps will fight
; today for the right to enter the
I finals Wednesday. They are winners
I of Leagues IV and 111 respectively.
Today's fracas will find Lucas, the
i Alpha Dclt Hurler who pulled the
| Campo game out of the fire by his
j fast pitching, in a duel with Wood
| worth, the Phi Kap moundsman.
Lucas at his best is probably the
j better of the two, but his incon
' sistency puts lum at a disadvantage, j
: The Phi Kap outfit has a couple of i
I hard hitters in Dodge and Walters,
who will have to do their best to
counteract the efforts of Naylon and
Thompson.
Sigma Nu's. Fiji's Meet
The Sigma Nu's an dFiji's will <
; meet in the pre-title contest in J
League I of the indoor series to j
; decide which one will enter the I
1 finals with the D.U. outfit tomor- j
row. This game was postponed from j
| last Friday.
Sequoia II Favorite
Sequoia II is a heavy favorite
; over the Kappa Sigma nine, having 1
I gone through the season so far un- j
! defeated. A victory in this game |
' will mean the League 111 cham- j
pionship, unless Encina IE should j
; squeeze out a win over the strong j
i KA. team. An upset is not prob- '
I able, however, since the Kappa '
Alpha's have an all-around strong \
; outfit led by Fritz Wright, whose 1
pitching has been consistently good.
Phi Delta Phi is doped to down
the Yliads, by virtue of a less j
stinging defeat at the hands of the
I Business School.
