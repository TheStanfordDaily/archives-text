From the cxciting likelihood that ,
the United States will win the 110-
meter high hurdles and place twice
in the 400-meter lows, one is di
verted only by the quaint and hu
morous tale of Lord David Burghley
at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. |
Lord David is the only titled Eng
lishman ever to hurdle for Britain. '
At Amsterdam he turned out of his |
own lane—a flagrant foul—and ran |
right in front of the American mil- j
lionaire and champion, F. Morgan ]
Taylor, to win the 400-meter.
Favorite Event
These long-distance hurdles will j
be one of the most thrilling events !
to watch of all the Olympics, though
one of the hardest on the runners.
Jimmy Meeks of Occidental is good. '

400-METER HURDLES
1. Facelli (Italy)
2. Beatty (United States)
3. Meeks (United States)
4. Burghley (England)
5. Wilen (Finland)

Dick Pomeroy, L.A.A.C., is a tenth
of a second slower than Meeks.
Trojan press agents say, which
may make it true, that Ablo Wich is
fast in practice. He is the 440-man
I who took third in the recent Stan
j ford meet. Jimmy Jaine of the Tro-
I jans promises.
Italy to Win
Heaviest foreign threat is cen
! tered in Facelli of Italy, and he
i looms as probable winner, having
I run 52.8 with the wind. Wilen of
i Finland, 54.3; Viel of France, Schu
! man of Germany, are other men
j tionables.
Brazil's only decent entry in the
; whole Olympics is in this event, with
' its man, Padilla, this South Ameri
! can republic being in a bad way
; for athletes.
America's High Hurdles
The 110-meter high hurdles,
| meanwhile, are one of America's
strongest events. Percy Beard holds
J the world's record at 14.2, though
i he is not as consistent as Jimmy
i Meeks of Occidental, best and
'[ smoothest of American hurdlers,
| who Saturday night at the Fresno
relays, tied the coast record of 14.5

seconds.
George Saling of lowa University,
and Jack Keller, Ohio State sopho
more, hang at 14.4. Jeddy Welch of
U.S.C. is an outside possibility at
14.7.
Veteran Lord David
Lord David Burghey, the defour
ing Englishman, will enter his third
Olympics at a possible 14.4, with
Peterson of Sweden, and Sjostedt of
Finland a half a jump behind.
Americans have been hurdling
above average since the last Olym
pics, with the foreigners below par.

America's High Hurdles
The 110-meter high hurdles,
| meanwhile, are one of America's
strongest events. Percy Beard holds
J the world's record at 14.2, though
i he is not as consistent as Jimmy
i Meeks of Occidental, best and
'[ smoothest of American hurdlers,
| who Saturday night at the Fresno
relays, tied the coast record of 14.5

seconds.
George Saling of lowa University,
and Jack Keller, Ohio State sopho
more, hang at 14.4. Jeddy Welch of
U.S.C. is an outside possibility at
14.7.
Veteran Lord David
Lord David Burghey, the defour
ing Englishman, will enter his third
Olympics at a possible 14.4, with
Peterson of Sweden, and Sjostedt of
Finland a half a jump behind.
Americans have been hurdling
above average since the last Olym
pics, with the foreigners below par.

From the cxciting likelihood that ,
the United States will win the 110-
meter high hurdles and place twice
in the 400-meter lows, one is di
verted only by the quaint and hu
morous tale of Lord David Burghley
at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. |
Lord David is the only titled Eng
lishman ever to hurdle for Britain. '
At Amsterdam he turned out of his |
own lane—a flagrant foul—and ran |
right in front of the American mil- j
lionaire and champion, F. Morgan ]
Taylor, to win the 400-meter.
Favorite Event
These long-distance hurdles will j
be one of the most thrilling events !
to watch of all the Olympics, though
one of the hardest on the runners.
Jimmy Meeks of Occidental is good. '

Dick Pomeroy, L.A.A.C., is a tenth
