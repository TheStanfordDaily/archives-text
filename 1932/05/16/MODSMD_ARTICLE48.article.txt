## Japanese Champions Clean Up Eastern Colleges In Baseball Tour

Announcement that Caddel, An- j
i derson, and Campbell will desert J
I their moleskins to join varsity base
i ball this week in preparation for the
| game with Rikkyo University of
I Japan, to be held this Friday, was
j made yesterday by Coach Harry
| Wolter.
j Although the team played its last
! conference game nearly a month
I ago, Wolter feels certain that a
I week's practice will round the nine
| into good shape.
On American Tour
The Rikkyo team came to the
United Stales early in April and
has been playing Northern and
Eastern universities with marked
success. Among its most outstanding
j victories was that over Yale, in
j which the Japanese team rolled up
I an 8-.1 score.
Rikkyo University, or Saint Paul's,
|as it is called in English, differs
I from other Japanese universities in
• that it is run by American mis
! sionaries. Its team has won the Big
; Six University Baseball League
! championship, which entitles it to
| the trip to the United States. It is
j famous in Japan for its sportsman-
J ship, and is known as "the finest
! team in Japan."
Strong Team Play
Kamenosuke Suzuki, Japanese
; student who attended Rikkyo last
■ year, and is now correspondent for
( a San Francisco newspaper, states
that, although the team has no
i coach, it is recognized as having re
markable teamwork. Tsuji is con
i sidered the best pitcher in Japan,
i possessing remarkable control, while
j Kikutani's forte is curves. The out
! field, according to Suzuki, is strong,
i while the infield has shown unusual
j batting ability.
Stanford's lineup, as announced
i yesterday, will probably consist of
j Anderson, pitcher; Livermore,
| catcher; Hearne, first base; Phiiippi,
I second; Trautman, third; Delmas,
.shortstop; Campbell, left field; Miles,
| right field; and Rintala, center field.
