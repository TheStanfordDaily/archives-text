# GENEVA MAP BE PARLEY SCENE
## Change Reported Due To Better Hotel Rates 
### 
PARIS, May 15. I/P)—The scene j
of Europe's newest scheduled pas
sing of the hat may be switched i
from Lausanne to Geneva, it is un- J
derstood today in the circles close !
to the reparations experts of the i
French Ministry of Finance.
Such a shift of the reparations j
conference will serve several pur- ;
poses, it is pointed out, among them '
the injecting of a revivifying drug
into the now dangerously clotted
veins of the disarmament confer- j
ence.
It is also noted that the League j
of Nations at Geneva has more j
ample facilities in the way of meet- |
ing rooms, where press telegraphic
systems are already installed. Then, j
too, Geneva's hotel rates have been j
scaled down to a point within rea- j
son.
New Argument
But France provides another ar- ]
gument, declaring that the ncgotia- !
tions among the leading statesmen,
begun under Secretaray of State
Stimson, were abandoned because
of the illness of Premier Tardieu,
and all agreed to resume their
talks at Geneva.
At Geneva, too, the parley would |
be closed to the Austrian pulse, in- |
asmuch as Austria's financial dif- j
Acuities are now in the hands of the
League.
