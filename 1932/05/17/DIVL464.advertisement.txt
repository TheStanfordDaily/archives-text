You KNOW
what you're getting
.... when you buy
advertised products
Careful analysis and scientific planning con
stitute sane advertising policy. Up-to-the
minute executives plan their advertising
campaigns by watching the fluctuations in
their sales, i.e., a drop in the sales total re
sults in an increased advertising budget.
This is sane advertising policy as brought
out further in the following statemnets.
Felix Lowy, vice-president, Colgate-Palm
olive-Peet Company—No organization can
grow so large and no article of merchandise
can become so firmly entrenched as to jus
tify a niggardly advertising policy.
O. B. Chapelle, publicity manager, Premier
Vacuum Cleaner Company—How any con
cern with vision wi 11 permit its name to drop
from the public eye simply because, for a
period of a year or so, boom conditions do
not prevail, is more than we can under
stand. If others choose to slip down the
ladder during the lean months the decision
is theirs, but our policy at all times is to
maintain our position.
