HOPEWELL, N.J., May 16. {&)—
Hie firm step of the aging "Jafsie"
•arried him tonight along a circuit
>us trial toward the extortionist to
vhom he paid $50,000 ransom, while
he police formally re-enlisted the
vide-flung forces of the government
n the task of avenging Baby Lind
>ergh.
Dr. John F. Condon, the educator
vho came out of a virtual retire
nent at 72 to assist Colonel Charles
V. Lindbergh, today peered at the
ogues galleries of jails and prisons
n Westchester County, New York.
Scandinavian Named
He was hopeful he might find the
ikeness of the extortionist, who ap
jeared to be a Scandinavian and
vas known to him only by his first
lame. This was the man to whom
le gave $50,000 in a Bronx ceme
ery.
Beginning tomorrow Dr. Condon
ilso will attend the daily police
ineup in New York City on the
heory that either the extortionist
night be a professional criminal or
hat he might endeavor to hide him
elf in jail for a minor offense.
Claims Six in Gang
Dr. Condon, it was officially
tated, told police he met personally
>nly one member of the gang with
vhom he dealt, but this member is
>resumed to have told him there
vere four other men and a woman.
7hc shadowy figure he treated with
n the cemetery also claimed one
nember of the gang was acquainted
vith Dr. Condon.
These bare uncontroverted facts
till left open to conjecture the
luestion of whether the criminals,
n contact with Dr. Condon were
>ne and the same as the five-man
;ang with whom John Hughes Cur
is communicated off the Atlantic
eaboai'd.

las followed the case with untiring
nterest from the outset, conferred

mel H. Norman Schwarzkopf, State
'olice head, would have charge of
ill police activities.
The Chief Executive also for
nally accepted the renewed offer
if Federal co-operation tendered by
Attorney-General Mitchell at the
lirection of the President. He ex
)ressed the thanks of the State for
he assistance already given by the
Government and endorsed the sug
