# Phi Beta Kappa Called Best 'House' on Campus
## 
### Rolph Malloch 
Take independent study and
pledge the best house on the campus,
Phi Beta Kappa!
The above isn't, but might very
well be the slogan of the independent
study plan; for in the six years since
its inauguration at Stanford, half of
its 40 graduates have won the key,
and 2(> of the 40 have been gradu
ated with distinction. Of the 26, 14
secured the coveted honor, "gradu
ated with great distinction."
The significant fact about these
records is that many students en
tered upon independent work with
only slightly better than B averages
and developed into outstanding stu
dents under the plan.
Until this year independent study
has been restricted to upper division
people, but under the five year grant
of the general education board for
purposes of developing independent
work in the lower division, 281
freshmen and sophomores are work
inn independently in two or more

| fields. Citizenship, English compo
sition, elementary history, clemen
l tary economics, general psychology,
and introductory political science are
! the subjects open for this type of
lower division study, with citizenship
claiming the greatest number of stu
dents working on the independent
plan.
Stanford's independent study plan
is more individual than those of
other universities that are experi
-1 menting with such methods. Here
each student may choose any field
'in which to work so long as he ful
! fills the requirements of his major
1 department. This freedom of choice
has led students into strange fields,
ranging from the "Psychology ol
Propaganda," to the "Evolution of
the Polish Republic."
One Stanford student, while en
rolled "in absentia" is studying and
doing research work in Geneva,
! Switzerland, receiving university
'credit through the independent study
j plan.
