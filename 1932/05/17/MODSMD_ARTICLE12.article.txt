# HIGH SCHOOL FAILS TO TRAIN THINKERS, SAYS DR. MURRAY
## 
### 
"The modem high school is turn
ing out students who are alert and
well-informed, but who are lacking
in the ability to think." Such was
the statement of Dr. Augustus Taber
Murray, Professor of Classical Lit
erature, in a recent interview.
Dr. Murray, who is retiring after
this year, went on to say, "The
question of whether I have noticed
a change in the students in the
years I have been here is a hard
one to answer. On the whole I be
lieve that if there has been any
change it has been for the worse.
"At present the high-school stu
dents take courses in manicuring,
window-dressing, and similar non
academic subjects which would be
very good in a vocational school but
do not train the student to think.
Of course it's what you would ex
pect of a classicist, but I believe
that the student should take sub
jects such as Latin and algebra as
mental discipline.
"Modern students," he went on to
say, "are too apt to follow the line
of least resistance, but one can't do
that in life. Also, too often a student
decides on his major interest when
he is well advanced in the Univer
sity and finds that the work he has
done has given him insufficient
training.
