# Typical Product Of Farm Stands Forth In Inquiry
## Men, Women Demonstrate Similarity Of Tastes, Love Especially 
### 
The picture of the typical Stan
fordite is completed today with the
publishing of the linal results of the
comprehensive survey of Senior
Class attitudes and opinions under
taken by the Daily through the med
ium of a questionnaire.
Already found to be a swimmer
and dancer, an agile conversation
alist on matters of sex, a reader of
Clarence Buddington Kelland, a
Hooverite, a football fan, and an ad
mirer of Marlene Dietrich and John
Barrymore, the senior's thoughts on
more serious matters are now pro
bed.
Encina Justified
The majority of the seniors voted
that the lower division requirements
should not be abolished, that com
pulsory living in Encina is justified,
and that a car is not a necessity for
a Stanford student.
All of the women and 97 per cent
of the men voting believe in love,
but only narrow majorities believe
in love-at-first-sight. The men
would marry a person who is with
out a college education, but a ma
jority of the women would refuse.
The seniors of both sexes believe
in democracy, but are against com
munism. The women have faith in
socialism, but the men do not.
All of the feminine voters are in
favor of careers for women; only
G5 per cent of the men agree.
Double Standard
A few more than half of the men
believe in the double standard, but
three-quarters of the women are
against it.
The seniors believe that the 18th
amendment should be repealed, and
that Mooney should be kept in jail.
The women think that the League of
Nations has been successful; the men
do not.
The Class of '32 is of the opinion
that the United States should recog
nize Russia, and that a Phi Beta
Kappa key is preferable to a Block
"S."
Thirty is the ideal age for a man
