# Seriousness of Captain Hables' Injury Unknown
## Determination of Track Leader's Condition Depends on Results Shown by X-Rays; Ralph Giberson Improves, May Leave Hospital Soon 
### DICK STROUSE 
U/ITII Captain Alvin 1 tables now in the handsome new Palo Alto Hos
pital (that, of recent days, has become the training place of the Stan
j ford track team) and with nary a single sprinter to throw against the
Golden Hear, the Wooden Horse, and the plain everyday Bruin, Stanford's
; entries in Saturday's California Intcrcollcgiates will he competing for the
l.ove of the sport and not for a team victory.
Hables' exact injury is still unknown. A pain in his side that might
indicate appendicitis caused his withdrawal from the mile relay in the
Fresno meet, and at the present time he is staying in the hospital await-

â€¢* ing the verdict of X-rays taken
yesterday.
Ralph Giberson, the last of the
I Indian sprinters to be injured, has
| shown considerable improvement
j and, according to Dr. E. F. Roth,
i should be out of confinement in a
; couple of days. However, Gibey will
, of course not be able to run Satur-
I day.
j Although most of the Stanford
men came through as expected in
' the West Coast Relays, some of the
best performances were not re
i corded in the summaries. Gus Meier,
| for example, was officially timed in
; 14.7 Lor his semi-final high hurdle
| flight.
Meier Beats Winner
In that race, Meier defeated
J Smith, who won in the finals. Jack
1 Brugman also ran a fine semi-final
heat, winning in 14.9 over the sen
j sational U.S.C. sophomore, Lyon. In
| the finals, a bad start and some
equally bad hurdling during the
early part of the race cost Meier a
win, as Gus nearly passed the en
| tire field in the last 30 yards.
Dave Brown got off a javelin toss
j on his last attempt that was some
where past the 190-foot mark, only
I to be told, much to his surprise, that
j he had fouled.
Too Much Competition
j In the broad-jump, Wally Butler
j reached the farthest distance made
I by an Indian jumper all year when
he leaped 23 feet 7 inches, but it
jso happened that 24 feet 7 inches
| took fourth place. Butler is iniprov
; ing as the season grows older, as he
i did last year, and figures to be be
j yond 24 feet when the 1.C.4-A.'s
j roll around.
Then Here Laborde, who took
| second in the regular discus event,
| heaved the platter better than 164
feet on something like five occasions
| after the meet was over. That, by
the way, is some six feet better than
i the new meet record made by Bob
j Jones.
Miller Going Up
Bill Miller and Bert DcGroot were
among the horde of pole-vaulters
who cleared 13 feet 2 inches to tic
for second place (although they
were officially credited with 13 feet
even) and Miller looked really good
for the first time this year. He made
that height on his first attempt, and
| missed the bar by five or six inches.
The explanation of Nellie Gray's
disappointing showing in the shot
j is due to a mighty throw of Brix'.s
: that carried beyond the 51-foot mark
; and two fouls of Gray's own. Brix's
| toss came on his first attempt and
i was followed immediately by Gray,
' whose throw of 50 and a couple of
i inches was called foul. Nellie's sec
-1 ond toss also was made on a foul,
and his third, though fair, lacked
distance.
