# Japanese Plot Fascist Stroke, Rowell Implies,
## Professor Reveals Former Knowledge Of Coup 
### Ronald Chinn 
Intimating that the assassination
of the Japanese Premier, Inukai,
and the bombing of government of
ficials' residences, may have been
a carefully laid plot of the Japa
nese army officials to accomplish a
Fascist revolution and allow the
army to have its own way in for
eign affairs, Chester H. Rowell yes
terday told his class in Interna
tional Politics that he had known
of the plot for six months.
"Everyone in Japan knew that
this conspiracy was brewing—at
least, if the army officers did not
know it they were the only ones,''
Rowell declared as he deplored the
deaths of lunkai, of the late prime
minister, fiamaguchi, who died of
a similar plot, and of lnoyue, able
finance minister, who was recently
murdered.
Gibbons Knew
''Why, even Floyd Gibbons learned
of this plot when he was flying over
Japan six weeks ago," Rowell re
marked.
The lecturer reminded his hearers
of a similar plot nipped in the bud
last November. "Just before the
murder of the premier was to take
place, the conspirators went home
to their last meal, for they knew
they must die for it —these Japa
nese fanatics value their lives very
cheaply," Rowell explained.
Plot Uncovered
"At their tables the plotters drank
water from wine cups, a sign that
it was their last meal. The servants
noticed this, reported the plot, the
army arrested the men. A few days
later the men were released with
the explanation that they were
merely 'misguided youths.' "
As a result of the coup, the jour
nalist pointed out that a party with
the army's aims might rule consti
tutionally, repudiating treaties, de
fying the League of Nations, making
open war on China, and possibly
starting a world war by provoking
trouble with Russia. Or another
possibility he saw was that the Em
peror, with his enormous prestige
in Japan, might declare himself
dictator
