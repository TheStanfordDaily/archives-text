# DRAMATIC CLUB TO GIVE READING
## 
### 
, "Young Woodley," unsentimental
j but observant study of an adolescent
j in love, is to be the third of the
j readings sponsored at meetings of
j Sword and Sandals. The play, by
John Van Druten, author of "There's
| Always Juliet," a current Broad
! way success, will be heard next
i Thursday evening in the Little
I Theatre.
Dorothy Tully was selected to
j read the one feminine role, that of
! Laura, young wife of Simmons, a
! severe and stupid housemaster in
an English school. Leland Chapin
of the Public Speaking Department
is reading the part of the school
master, while James Sandoe will
I essay the title role.
Robert Brauns will be Cope, a
fag; Edward Girzi, Vining; Joseph
Wolf, Ainger; and Andy Harris,
Millner. Wayne Bannister, campus
debater, is to read the role of Wood
ley's father. In charge of the meet
ing, Vallejo Gantner, president of
the organization, will read neces
sary .stage directions.
A frank, poignant study of mis
understood youth, because of its
nature rather difficult to read, the
play is the most serious thus far
'attempted by Sword and Sandals.
As usual, the meeting is to begin
at 7:30 o'clock, at which time the
i doors will be closed to late-comers.
