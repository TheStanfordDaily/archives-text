# The
						SPRINT Quarter ATROCITY
## 
### 
Saturday night a small audience, either misled by the
publicity blurb or having relatives iu the east, was sub
jected to a two-hour torture known as the Junior Opera.
The reputation of former operas prevented most of the
campus from wasting their time and money
on what turned out to be a hash of third-rate vaudeville,
cheap melodrama and what for the first few minutes
looked like a Junior Opera.
Even Eph Engleman, professionally repeating his moss
covered gags and feeble lines with his undeniable ability,
and a couple of good songs were unable to convert the
opera into something that did not insult the intelligence of
a campus audience.
Spring quarter is always overburdened with plays,
dances, and oilier forms of entertainment that tax the
staggering pocketbooks of the students. It is time to weed
out the least important and the Junior Opera stands at the
head of the list for abolition.
To ask anyone to pay .50 to sit on an uncomfortable
seal in an assembly hall that was never meant to be a
theater and look at an amateur performance so boring as
to almost make the harrassed spectators scream in agony
compares with the Hawaiian episode as one of the worst
crimes'of the year.
About the best thing one noticed at the opera was the
smallness of the audience, as a result of which the produc
tion went greatly in debt. This should be sufficient proof
that the campus is not particularly interested in Junior
Operas and the performance Saturday night should send
to the grave this long-dying yearly atrocity. Those in the
past were none too good and this one was atrocious.
Abolish the Junior Opera before it drags all other dra
matic performances on this campus down to its level!
