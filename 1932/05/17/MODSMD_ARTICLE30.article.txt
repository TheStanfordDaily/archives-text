# THE
						STANFORD SWIM RELAYS
## 
### 
Il may have been just another interesting swimming ex
hibition that a goodly crowd witnessed in Kneina pool
Saturday afternoon. In fact, that is all it was expected to
be, with results being of less consequence than the money
raised fort Olympic (lames fund.
On the other hand, it may have been the inauguration
of an annual relay carnival that could very easily grow into
one of the greatest events of its kind in the country. Krnst
Rraudsten, swim coach, visualized this as he watched the
enthusiasms of the spectators and the keenness of the
rivalry among competing swimmers Saturday, and urged
that the H.A.d. take advantage of its opportunity.
What could be done with an annual West ('.oast Swim
ming Carnival in the Stanford pool intrigues the imagina
tion. Stanford, Olympic Club, Athens (Jul), and L.A..1.C.
competed Saturday. A year hence il might well be those
plus California, 1.5.C., L.A.A.C., and C.C.L.A. Like the
Fresno Helays of Irack, it would become the Stanford He-
Jay. of swimming.
Obviously a carnival of tiiis sort is needed on the coast.
Auo after all, why should it not be in Kneina pool, one of
the most mod< rn, adequate swimming units in the country?
