''Sunny Jim" llolph, California's playboy governor, di
ma.\( (I a long and glorious career as chief clown of the
golden state yesterday, when he treated the populace to a
view of his smiling countenance as the piece de resistence
of a straw hat advertisement.
Simple souls who believed that even Rolph's effrontery
had its limits, should now bo completely disillusioned. The
governor of the sovereign state of California evidentlv goes
on the theory that anything is legitimate if it gets his face
before the public.
He lias opened department stores, decked himself in
Spanish garb for licstas hither and yon, escorted queens
at innumerable blossom fetes, presided over formal dedi
cations from the Oregon line to the Mexican border. And
now, doubtless because the supply of fairs and openings
is at a low ebb. "Sunny Jim" has resorted to the ad writers.
In a short time we may read that "not one cent was paid to
Coventor Rolph ," or perhaps the boot manufacturers
will take advantage of Holph's well known preference for
the high lopped style of foot-wear.
it ma\ be that the governor is garnering votes for the
in .1 election by his antics, but the California electorate
will d( monstralc a more appalling lack of intelligence than
has yel been found if il is favorably impressed by such
tact ics.
