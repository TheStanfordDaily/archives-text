# BULL SESSION
## THE 						CLASS CURVE 
### 
Stanford is a very advanced place |
in many respects. The campus is
"1.Q." conscious to an alarming de
gree. Any student body knows what j
a "perfect 36" denotes but not so j
many are so sure as to what an J
"imperfect (J3" connotes. And along
with the students' unofficial gib
bering on "I.Q.'s," there is a cer- j
tain amount of official proclamating
on what we are often led to believe
is a relentless thing—the grading
curve. It seems that a definite per- I
centage of the class must be sacri- 1
ficed to each of the various'
"grades." The caste system in dark- j
est India fades into mildest laxity i
by comparison.
The theory behind both "I.Q.'s" '
and grading curves is based on
countless thousands of cases. Over j
a long time the learned "savants" !
have discovered certain things to
be true. Then some young assistant- !
acting-almost instructor comes along !
and attempts to apply these findings!
to his handful of unhappy frosh. If j
the scale demands two "A's," two j
fortunates carry off that marker and)
no more.
If by some chance, an extraor
dinarily large batch of mental slug- j
gards congregate in one section, it I
matters not. The curve must be pre- :
served. And on the other hand if j
several top-heavies happen to en- 1
roll together, it still matters not. i
The class grading scale emerges un- |
altered and victorious. The scien- |
tific standard of education — as)

promulgated by the education de
partments — and worshipped by
high-school teachers — must be
maintained. And it is.
But even in large classes, we find
that grading by the so-called class
average is hopelessly inadequate. It
fails simply because it is often ig
nored in courses where high grades
are scarce. The professors who feel
that the way to goad the grade
slaves on to new heights is by starv
ing them—by keeping them on the
margin of subsistence —completely
ignore this thing called class aver
age.
Yet the professors who are hor
rified to find their class has memo
rized all the petty facts required,
can always beat the hopefuls down
with that very brutal bludgeon—
the class curve. Yet if the class re
volts at the nauseating details, does
the curve become a life-line thrown
to the drowning? Of course not. The
class curve is thus a multi-stationed
instrument. If the grades run high,
ii can rob the sweet ffuits of vic
tory from out of the very hands of
the starving. If the grades fail to
run—and content themselves sim
ply with creeping—the curve sud
denly collapses and becomes in
operative.
In both cases organized pedantry
sweeps on to new and better
heights of empty victory on the
groaning bodies of outraged grade
slaves. —Abe Mellinkoff

promulgated by the education de
partments — and worshipped by
high-school teachers — must be
maintained. And it is.
But even in large classes, we find
that grading by the so-called class
average is hopelessly inadequate. It
fails simply because it is often ig
nored in courses where high grades
are scarce. The professors who feel
that the way to goad the grade
slaves on to new heights is by starv
ing them—by keeping them on the
margin of subsistence —completely
ignore this thing called class aver
age.
Yet the professors who are hor
rified to find their class has memo
rized all the petty facts required,
can always beat the hopefuls down
with that very brutal bludgeon—
the class curve. Yet if the class re
volts at the nauseating details, does
the curve become a life-line thrown
to the drowning? Of course not. The
class curve is thus a multi-stationed
instrument. If the grades run high,
ii can rob the sweet ffuits of vic
tory from out of the very hands of
the starving. If the grades fail to
run—and content themselves sim
ply with creeping—the curve sud
denly collapses and becomes in
operative.
In both cases organized pedantry
sweeps on to new and better
heights of empty victory on the
groaning bodies of outraged grade
slaves. —Abe Mellinkoff
Stanford is a very advanced place |
in many respects. The campus is
"1.Q." conscious to an alarming de
gree. Any student body knows what j
a "perfect 36" denotes but not so j
many are so sure as to what an J
"imperfect (J3" connotes. And along
with the students' unofficial gib
bering on "I.Q.'s," there is a cer- j
tain amount of official proclamating
on what we are often led to believe
is a relentless thing—the grading
curve. It seems that a definite per- I
centage of the class must be sacri- 1
ficed to each of the various'
"grades." The caste system in dark- j
est India fades into mildest laxity i
by comparison.
The theory behind both "I.Q.'s" '
and grading curves is based on
countless thousands of cases. Over j
a long time the learned "savants" !
have discovered certain things to
be true. Then some young assistant- !
acting-almost instructor comes along !
and attempts to apply these findings!
to his handful of unhappy frosh. If j
the scale demands two "A's," two j
fortunates carry off that marker and)
no more.
If by some chance, an extraor
dinarily large batch of mental slug- j
gards congregate in one section, it I
matters not. The curve must be pre- :
served. And on the other hand if j
several top-heavies happen to en- 1
roll together, it still matters not. i
The class grading scale emerges un- |
altered and victorious. The scien- |
tific standard of education — as)

promulgated by the education de
partments — and worshipped by
high-school teachers — must be
maintained. And it is.
