i The Editor, Sir:
j The following is merely a tem
perate explanation of certain events
| that have transpired this week-end
! intended to satisfy the whimsical
peculiarities of a badly spoiled child
who seems somehow to have man
aged to reach his third year as a
Stanford roughie in long pants
without learning to use his big blue
eyes for the purpose of accurate ob
j servation—and is NOT intended as
| a rebuttal in a childish debate which
1 has no place in the Daily columns.
Toyon's 'Panzee Targhetta has
seen fit to criticize the action of En
-1 cina Club Friday evening in pro
hibiting the regular influx of roughs
to the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gym on four counts, each of which
are erroneous—if not deliberate
falsehoods. First, allow me to ex
i plain these petty, flimsy, imagina
. tive, and obviously fictitious so
i called "arguments" advanced by
the campus "Ape-man."
1) Mr. Targhetta states that the
dance floor was NOT crowded. Let
i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.
i
| 3) Mr. Targhetta claims that those
j attempting to crash did NOT want
' to clutter up the floor in tagging
; the fellows who payed $3.00 to en-
I joy themselves that evening. In the
first place, nothing of this sort was
! told the men at the door, and in
: the second place, when in Heaven's
! name do Stanford men of Mr. Tar
ghetta's caliber go to a dance with
' the intention of sitting on a balcony
I to watch the proceedings?
[ 4) The few remaining roughs at
10 minutes to one o'clock WERE let
in, but they were too few to start
I tagging then and possessed too much
| common sence to cut in on the last
J dance anywny.
INCIDENTALLY—No "Peninsula
i shoe clerks and Redwood City
' cuties" who Mr. Targhetta bewil
deredly thinks he recognized there
j were permitted to enter without
bids. As for visitors from the Kid
Party and the Barn Dance, they
' were permitted to enter in small
j numbers and to remain for one
: dance group, after which they left
to make room for additional guests.
J I do not think that 'Panzee saw his
j "Redwood cuties" at a dance unless
they were disguised as kids.
A word of explanation regarding
i the entire affair. Over a month be
j fore (he dance at a committee meet
j ing it was foreseen that the unusual
j attraction of such nn orchestra as
I had been engaged for the affair
| would draw an unusually large
i crowd and necessarily cause a situa
i tion such as this to arise.
Therefore, it has been announced
| consistently and continuously since
i the bid sale first started that the
I roughs could not be admitted to the

| affair. It was NOT a sudden move;
Mr. Targhetta realized this (having
. been taught to read the English
language) and was perfectly aware
! of the probable outcome of a bull
| headed attempt to crash the affair.
There is nothing objectionable to
the rough at the ordinary campus
i dance. It is tradition to let him in
I at a certain hour. Traditions are all
; very well and good, but they do not
apply to all situations in the same
: manner. If the roughs could find
; some way to construct a larger
' dance floor, with plenty of room for
everybody, and also furnish the ad
' ditional funds requisite for adequate
decoration, then the problem might
be simply solved, but now —it is a
) question of whether to have a good
i dance or not, and Encina Club
I chose to attempt the affirmative to
! this question.
I have attempted to avoid indulg
j ing in personalities, but in conclu
; sion and in reply to Mr. Targhetta's
reference to the "smoothie" frosh,

may I ask if that illustrious gentle-
I man is accustomed to attending a j
'strictly dress affair in a pair of dirty
i cords and an ancient shirt with his J
! red hair blazing as it waves in the ,
1 wind? And since when has the ■
' flavor of a pair of flannels anything
to do with his sampling a campus
dance?

I PItlC'E OF BOLONEY ON TIIE UP
The Editor, Sir:
The "White Elephant" editorial
appearing in the Friday issue of the
Daily has been the cause of the fol
lowing outburst of individual opin
ion. Whether or not the argument ;
presented is sound is not the ques- '
tion, I am simply a radical youth :
who needs must open the salety j
valve unless the steam within shall ,
1 burst its container. So please, gentle
reader, take what I say for what it
1 is worth and no more. For the bene
j fit of those who care to refute my
| arguments 1 will add that I am a
pacifist, I am a taxpayer, and that
I am a belligerent citizen of the
United States who clamors for eon- i
1 structive political, social, and eco- i
nomic reform. Though I have no i
definite formula for the general I
improvement of our great and glori
ous country and the manner in
which it is run, I do feel that the
; existing form of government in the
United States is not the best that ;
can be obtained (nor do I advocate j
,a Communistic regime), and I do j
not conscientiously believe that pre-j
' i vailing economic conditions through- !
, out the land are the direct result I
of mismanagement and inefficiency
in the present governmental setup.
Due to the limitation of space in |
the Daily, I will confine my argu
ments to a matter that is now be
fore us; a matter that is possibly
but a trivial detail in the workings
iof our legislative and executive
departments, but a matter that is
, sufficiently understood by the deni
i zens of the Farm to at least afford
' a valid field for attack.
To wit: the latest toy of the
! United States Navy that was con
< structed at a cost of some five mil
> lions of dollars of good hard legal
i ( tender donated by you, by me, and
I | the rest of the suckers that stand
I by and let our Congressmen appro
' priate money for useless and wan
i tonly extravagant purposes. Need
'l less to say, I speak of the Akron

that has just recently arrived in our
community. Now this Ls the way the
wheels of government go around:
Admiral so-and-so gets a hot idea
that the Navy needs a big gas bag
to play with, for Ihe small airplanes,
the unwieldy battleships, and the
other toys of depredation are not
sufficiently novel to amuse himself
and his subordinates. Admiral goes
to Cabinet Head, Cabinet Head goes
to Congressman, and Congressman
goes to orating for an appropriation
for one dirigible to be constructed
for the Navy "in the interests of
the advancement of aviation, and in
the development of technical ability
to operate lighter-than-air-craft,
matters that are so vital to the
maintenance of domestic tranquility
and the protection from foreign in
vasion and aggression." The'silvery
tones of the Congressman's voice,

I his fiery diplomacy, and the inces- f
| sant rush of Congress to get things f
over with and to get on to more c
J pressing matters or to get out to f
I the golf course, soon manage to c
I furnish the Navy with the big piece \
j of boloney. j >
Five million bucks for one sausage t
| is a lot of dough. That is ju.st five ; r
| million more than I would pay or j f
i could pay at the present time or t
any time in the future for that ; c
i matter. Five millions in the red \
I would break many a large corpora- :
j tion, bankrupt many a linancier, and
I wreck many a business establish- j.
' ment. However, "the government is <
large, the government is rich, and t
I the government is the people" sez |
j you and sez me, in defense of such <
extravagance. But is such an argu- i <
| ment valid from a standpoint of (
: practicability? I do not profess to (
■ be a final authority on the justifx- ;
; cation of public expenditures but 1 .
! would like to know of what prac- ' (
j tical use the Akron is to the United j
• States of America, and to "We, the j 1
I people of the United States." j }
How thinking people can stand by ]

' propriation of five million dollars <
| for a dirigible that is in no sense j .
j of the word beneficial to the coun- ;
! try from any standpoint, be it Naval
I strength or anything else, is more ; i
I than I can see. A dirigible the size j
J of the Akron represents too large i
I an investment to insure an equi- j
1 table income from its operation even i
j if it were put to commercial use. In |
j the case of war it would be worse j
I than useless for it would take a j
'• mighty squadron of pursuit planes
j to protect it from the enemy and
i even then a chance direct hit would
j send the airship crashing to the
• ground, Rosendahl and all. It could
< i hardly be used for bombing pur
: j poses for any place tactically worth
i i bombing would have an adequate
;' defense to at least send one shell
. • into its six and a half million cubic

feet of gas. The helium is not in
flammable, it is true, but an in
cendiary missile would kindle the
fabric of the ship like so much tin
der. One by one, the possible ad
vantages of the use of the Akron in
wartime activities drop out when
exposed to the potentialities of
modern scientific warfare. Its use
for observation is out, its use for
transportation of materials and sol
i diers of war is out, the damn thing
; would make a swell cloud yacht for
a multimillionaire, however.
An appropriation for two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars recently
went through Congress for the
maintenance of the dirigible chris
tened after La Ciudad de Nuestra
I Senora. A quarter of a million
! smackers for the maintenance of
one sack of helium. My, my, think
:of all the Big Game tickets that
amount would purchase—even at
| scalpers' prices it might fill the sta
dium.
i Well, I have said enough for this
! time and 1 hope that the reader has
I not become too disgusted with my
i retreat into the superlative. Suf
| fice it to say that boloney is the
i "great" American dish and it tastes
! fine on most occasions, but when
!we have to put out five million

hundred and lii'ty thousand for the
, removal of mold from another, said

j The following is merely a tem
perate explanation of certain events

! intended to satisfy the whimsical
peculiarities of a badly spoiled child
who seems somehow to have man
aged to reach his third year as a
Stanford roughie in long pants
without learning to use his big blue
eyes for the purpose of accurate ob
j servation—and is NOT intended as
| a rebuttal in a childish debate which
1 has no place in the Daily columns.
Toyon's 'Panzee Targhetta has
seen fit to criticize the action of En
-1 cina Club Friday evening in pro
hibiting the regular influx of roughs
to the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gym on four counts, each of which
are erroneous—if not deliberate
falsehoods. First, allow me to ex
i plain these petty, flimsy, imagina
. tive, and obviously fictitious so
i called "arguments" advanced by
the campus "Ape-man."
1) Mr. Targhetta states that the
dance floor was NOT crowded. Let
i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.
i
| 3) Mr. Targhetta claims that those
j attempting to crash did NOT want
' to clutter up the floor in tagging
; the fellows who payed $3.00 to en-
I joy themselves that evening. In the
first place, nothing of this sort was
! told the men at the door, and in
: the second place, when in Heaven's
! name do Stanford men of Mr. Tar
ghetta's caliber go to a dance with
' the intention of sitting on a balcony
I to watch the proceedings?
[ 4) The few remaining roughs at
10 minutes to one o'clock WERE let
in, but they were too few to start
I tagging then and possessed too much
| common sence to cut in on the last
J dance anywny.
INCIDENTALLY—No "Peninsula
i shoe clerks and Redwood City
' cuties" who Mr. Targhetta bewil
deredly thinks he recognized there
j were permitted to enter without
bids. As for visitors from the Kid
Party and the Barn Dance, they
' were permitted to enter in small
j numbers and to remain for one
: dance group, after which they left
to make room for additional guests.
J I do not think that 'Panzee saw his
j "Redwood cuties" at a dance unless
they were disguised as kids.
A word of explanation regarding
i the entire affair. Over a month be
j fore (he dance at a committee meet
j ing it was foreseen that the unusual
j attraction of such nn orchestra as
I had been engaged for the affair
| would draw an unusually large
i crowd and necessarily cause a situa
i tion such as this to arise.
Therefore, it has been announced
| consistently and continuously since
i the bid sale first started that the
I roughs could not be admitted to the

| affair. It was NOT a sudden move;
Mr. Targhetta realized this (having
. been taught to read the English
language) and was perfectly aware
! of the probable outcome of a bull
| headed attempt to crash the affair.
There is nothing objectionable to
the rough at the ordinary campus
i dance. It is tradition to let him in
I at a certain hour. Traditions are all
; very well and good, but they do not
apply to all situations in the same
: manner. If the roughs could find
; some way to construct a larger
' dance floor, with plenty of room for
everybody, and also furnish the ad
' ditional funds requisite for adequate
decoration, then the problem might
be simply solved, but now —it is a
) question of whether to have a good
i dance or not, and Encina Club
I chose to attempt the affirmative to
! this question.
I have attempted to avoid indulg
j ing in personalities, but in conclu
; sion and in reply to Mr. Targhetta's
reference to the "smoothie" frosh,

may I ask if that illustrious gentle-
I man is accustomed to attending a j
'strictly dress affair in a pair of dirty
i cords and an ancient shirt with his J
! red hair blazing as it waves in the ,
1 wind? And since when has the ■
' flavor of a pair of flannels anything
to do with his sampling a campus
dance?

i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.

| 3) Mr. Targhetta claims that those
j attempting to crash did NOT want
' to clutter up the floor in tagging
; the fellows who payed $3.00 to en-
I joy themselves that evening. In the
first place, nothing of this sort was
! told the men at the door, and in
: the second place, when in Heaven's
! name do Stanford men of Mr. Tar
ghetta's caliber go to a dance with
' the intention of sitting on a balcony
I to watch the proceedings?
[ 4) The few remaining roughs at
10 minutes to one o'clock WERE let
in, but they were too few to start
I tagging then and possessed too much
| common sence to cut in on the last
J dance anywny.
INCIDENTALLY—No "Peninsula
i shoe clerks and Redwood City
' cuties" who Mr. Targhetta bewil
deredly thinks he recognized there
j were permitted to enter without
bids. As for visitors from the Kid
Party and the Barn Dance, they
' were permitted to enter in small
j numbers and to remain for one
: dance group, after which they left
to make room for additional guests.
J I do not think that 'Panzee saw his
j "Redwood cuties" at a dance unless
they were disguised as kids.
A word of explanation regarding
i the entire affair. Over a month be
j fore (he dance at a committee meet
j ing it was foreseen that the unusual
j attraction of such nn orchestra as
I had been engaged for the affair
| would draw an unusually large
i crowd and necessarily cause a situa

Therefore, it has been announced

Mr. Targhetta realized this (having
. been taught to read the English
language) and was perfectly aware

There is nothing objectionable to
the rough at the ordinary campus
i dance. It is tradition to let him in
I at a certain hour. Traditions are all
; very well and good, but they do not
apply to all situations in the same
: manner. If the roughs could find
; some way to construct a larger
' dance floor, with plenty of room for
everybody, and also furnish the ad
' ditional funds requisite for adequate
decoration, then the problem might
be simply solved, but now —it is a
) question of whether to have a good
i dance or not, and Encina Club

I have attempted to avoid indulg

may I ask if that illustrious gentle-
I man is accustomed to attending a j

The Editor, Sir:
The "White Elephant" editorial

tion, I am simply a radical youth :

not conscientiously believe that pre-j
' i vailing economic conditions through- !
, out the land are the direct result I
of mismanagement and inefficiency
in the present governmental setup.
Due to the limitation of space in |
the Daily, I will confine my argu
ments to a matter that is now be
fore us; a matter that is possibly
but a trivial detail in the workings
iof our legislative and executive

i tonly extravagant purposes. Need
'l less to say, I speak of the Akron

that has just recently arrived in our
community. Now this Ls the way the
wheels of government go around:
Admiral so-and-so gets a hot idea
that the Navy needs a big gas bag
to play with, for Ihe small airplanes,
the unwieldy battleships, and the
other toys of depredation are not
sufficiently novel to amuse himself
and his subordinates. Admiral goes
to Cabinet Head, Cabinet Head goes
to Congressman, and Congressman
goes to orating for an appropriation
for one dirigible to be constructed
for the Navy "in the interests of
the advancement of aviation, and in
the development of technical ability
to operate lighter-than-air-craft,
matters that are so vital to the
maintenance of domestic tranquility
and the protection from foreign in

I his fiery diplomacy, and the inces- f

J pressing matters or to get out to f
I the golf course, soon manage to c

feet of gas. The helium is not in
flammable, it is true, but an in
cendiary missile would kindle the
fabric of the ship like so much tin
der. One by one, the possible ad
vantages of the use of the Akron in
wartime activities drop out when
exposed to the potentialities of
modern scientific warfare. Its use
for observation is out, its use for
transportation of materials and sol
i diers of war is out, the damn thing
; would make a swell cloud yacht for
a multimillionaire, however.
An appropriation for two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars recently
went through Congress for the
maintenance of the dirigible chris

peculiarities of a badly spoiled child

without learning to use his big blue

1 has no place in the Daily columns.
Toyon's 'Panzee Targhetta has
seen fit to criticize the action of En
-1 cina Club Friday evening in pro
hibiting the regular influx of roughs
to the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gym on four counts, each of which
are erroneous—if not deliberate
falsehoods. First, allow me to ex
i plain these petty, flimsy, imagina
. tive, and obviously fictitious so
i called "arguments" advanced by
the campus "Ape-man."
1) Mr. Targhetta states that the
dance floor was NOT crowded. Let
i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.
i
| 3) Mr. Targhetta claims that those
j attempting to crash did NOT want
' to clutter up the floor in tagging
; the fellows who payed $3.00 to en-
I joy themselves that evening. In the
first place, nothing of this sort was
! told the men at the door, and in
: the second place, when in Heaven's
! name do Stanford men of Mr. Tar
ghetta's caliber go to a dance with
' the intention of sitting on a balcony
I to watch the proceedings?
[ 4) The few remaining roughs at
10 minutes to one o'clock WERE let
in, but they were too few to start
I tagging then and possessed too much
| common sence to cut in on the last
J dance anywny.
INCIDENTALLY—No "Peninsula
i shoe clerks and Redwood City
' cuties" who Mr. Targhetta bewil
deredly thinks he recognized there
j were permitted to enter without
bids. As for visitors from the Kid
Party and the Barn Dance, they
' were permitted to enter in small
j numbers and to remain for one
: dance group, after which they left
to make room for additional guests.
J I do not think that 'Panzee saw his
j "Redwood cuties" at a dance unless
they were disguised as kids.
A word of explanation regarding
i the entire affair. Over a month be
j fore (he dance at a committee meet
j ing it was foreseen that the unusual
j attraction of such nn orchestra as
I had been engaged for the affair
| would draw an unusually large
i crowd and necessarily cause a situa
i tion such as this to arise.
Therefore, it has been announced
| consistently and continuously since
i the bid sale first started that the
I roughs could not be admitted to the

| affair. It was NOT a sudden move;
Mr. Targhetta realized this (having
. been taught to read the English
language) and was perfectly aware
! of the probable outcome of a bull
| headed attempt to crash the affair.
There is nothing objectionable to
the rough at the ordinary campus
i dance. It is tradition to let him in
I at a certain hour. Traditions are all
; very well and good, but they do not
apply to all situations in the same
: manner. If the roughs could find
; some way to construct a larger
' dance floor, with plenty of room for
everybody, and also furnish the ad
' ditional funds requisite for adequate
decoration, then the problem might
be simply solved, but now —it is a
) question of whether to have a good
i dance or not, and Encina Club
I chose to attempt the affirmative to
! this question.
I have attempted to avoid indulg
j ing in personalities, but in conclu
; sion and in reply to Mr. Targhetta's
reference to the "smoothie" frosh,

may I ask if that illustrious gentle-
I man is accustomed to attending a j
'strictly dress affair in a pair of dirty
i cords and an ancient shirt with his J
! red hair blazing as it waves in the ,
1 wind? And since when has the ■
' flavor of a pair of flannels anything
to do with his sampling a campus
dance?

I PItlC'E OF BOLONEY ON TIIE UP
The Editor, Sir:
The "White Elephant" editorial
appearing in the Friday issue of the
Daily has been the cause of the fol
lowing outburst of individual opin
ion. Whether or not the argument ;
presented is sound is not the ques- '
tion, I am simply a radical youth :
who needs must open the salety j
valve unless the steam within shall ,
1 burst its container. So please, gentle
reader, take what I say for what it
1 is worth and no more. For the bene
j fit of those who care to refute my
| arguments 1 will add that I am a
pacifist, I am a taxpayer, and that
I am a belligerent citizen of the
United States who clamors for eon- i
1 structive political, social, and eco- i

definite formula for the general I
improvement of our great and glori

i The Editor, Sir:
j The following is merely a tem
perate explanation of certain events
| that have transpired this week-end
! intended to satisfy the whimsical
peculiarities of a badly spoiled child
who seems somehow to have man
aged to reach his third year as a
Stanford roughie in long pants
without learning to use his big blue
eyes for the purpose of accurate ob
j servation—and is NOT intended as
| a rebuttal in a childish debate which
1 has no place in the Daily columns.
Toyon's 'Panzee Targhetta has
seen fit to criticize the action of En
-1 cina Club Friday evening in pro
hibiting the regular influx of roughs
to the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gym on four counts, each of which
are erroneous—if not deliberate
falsehoods. First, allow me to ex
i plain these petty, flimsy, imagina
. tive, and obviously fictitious so
i called "arguments" advanced by
the campus "Ape-man."
1) Mr. Targhetta states that the
dance floor was NOT crowded. Let
i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.

i The Editor, Sir:
j The following is merely a tem
perate explanation of certain events
| that have transpired this week-end
! intended to satisfy the whimsical
peculiarities of a badly spoiled child
who seems somehow to have man
aged to reach his third year as a
Stanford roughie in long pants
without learning to use his big blue
eyes for the purpose of accurate ob
j servation—and is NOT intended as
| a rebuttal in a childish debate which
1 has no place in the Daily columns.
Toyon's 'Panzee Targhetta has
seen fit to criticize the action of En
-1 cina Club Friday evening in pro
hibiting the regular influx of roughs
to the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gym on four counts, each of which
are erroneous—if not deliberate
falsehoods. First, allow me to ex
i plain these petty, flimsy, imagina
. tive, and obviously fictitious so
i called "arguments" advanced by
the campus "Ape-man."
1) Mr. Targhetta states that the
dance floor was NOT crowded. Let
i me add that approximately 200 cou
; pies were enjoying themselves on a
i floor that had just enough room to
. move about in comfort—almost
| twice the number present at the
j Engineers 1 dance two weeks earlier.
If one rough was to be let in (and
I exceptions could not be made even
for Mr. Targhetta) all must be ad
; mitted, and this would include
crashers from all the peninsula par
! ties that evening. And, as I have
pointed out, and anyone dancing
i that evening would have testified,
there was no room for such action
which would inevitably convert the
place into a typical Roble jolly-up
as they would gradually crowd the
dancers into the center of the floor.
2) Mr. Targhetta shouts that there
| is a balcony from which the roughs
i might view the affair in contented
enjoyment. I would say that, if he
; is in the habit of peering through
heavy black curtains, he would have
been welcome to sit there had he
suggested it at the time. It happens
that the entire balcony was cut off
by means of drapes both for the
decorative effect and for the pur
; pose of preventing unnecessary vi
bration from the loud speakers in
that corner of the room.
i
| 3) Mr. Targhetta claims that those
j attempting to crash did NOT want
' to clutter up the floor in tagging
; the fellows who payed $3.00 to en-
I joy themselves that evening. In the
first place, nothing of this sort was
! told the men at the door, and in
: the second place, when in Heaven's
! name do Stanford men of Mr. Tar
ghetta's caliber go to a dance with
' the intention of sitting on a balcony
I to watch the proceedings?
[ 4) The few remaining roughs at
10 minutes to one o'clock WERE let
in, but they were too few to start
I tagging then and possessed too much
| common sence to cut in on the last
J dance anywny.
INCIDENTALLY—No "Peninsula
i shoe clerks and Redwood City
' cuties" who Mr. Targhetta bewil
deredly thinks he recognized there
j were permitted to enter without
bids. As for visitors from the Kid
Party and the Barn Dance, they
' were permitted to enter in small
j numbers and to remain for one
: dance group, after which they left
to make room for additional guests.
J I do not think that 'Panzee saw his
j "Redwood cuties" at a dance unless
they were disguised as kids.
A word of explanation regarding
i the entire affair. Over a month be
j fore (he dance at a committee meet
j ing it was foreseen that the unusual
j attraction of such nn orchestra as
I had been engaged for the affair
| would draw an unusually large
i crowd and necessarily cause a situa
i tion such as this to arise.
Therefore, it has been announced
| consistently and continuously since
i the bid sale first started that the
I roughs could not be admitted to the

| affair. It was NOT a sudden move;
Mr. Targhetta realized this (having
. been taught to read the English
language) and was perfectly aware
! of the probable outcome of a bull
| headed attempt to crash the affair.
There is nothing objectionable to
the rough at the ordinary campus
i dance. It is tradition to let him in
I at a certain hour. Traditions are all
; very well and good, but they do not
apply to all situations in the same
: manner. If the roughs could find
; some way to construct a larger
' dance floor, with plenty of room for
everybody, and also furnish the ad
' ditional funds requisite for adequate
decoration, then the problem might
be simply solved, but now —it is a
) question of whether to have a good
i dance or not, and Encina Club
I chose to attempt the affirmative to
! this question.
I have attempted to avoid indulg
j ing in personalities, but in conclu
; sion and in reply to Mr. Targhetta's
reference to the "smoothie" frosh,

may I ask if that illustrious gentle-
I man is accustomed to attending a j
'strictly dress affair in a pair of dirty
i cords and an ancient shirt with his J
! red hair blazing as it waves in the ,
1 wind? And since when has the ■
' flavor of a pair of flannels anything
to do with his sampling a campus
dance?
Sincerely submitted,
Stan Beaub;.ire
P.S.: All who entered the Gym
Friday evening, with the exception ,
of the kids, either had bids or pass
out checks.
I PItlC'E OF BOLONEY ON TIIE UP
The Editor, Sir:
The "White Elephant" editorial
appearing in the Friday issue of the
Daily has been the cause of the fol
lowing outburst of individual opin
ion. Whether or not the argument ;
presented is sound is not the ques- '
tion, I am simply a radical youth :
who needs must open the salety j
valve unless the steam within shall ,
1 burst its container. So please, gentle
reader, take what I say for what it
1 is worth and no more. For the bene
j fit of those who care to refute my
| arguments 1 will add that I am a
pacifist, I am a taxpayer, and that
I am a belligerent citizen of the
United States who clamors for eon- i
1 structive political, social, and eco- i
nomic reform. Though I have no i
definite formula for the general I
improvement of our great and glori
ous country and the manner in
which it is run, I do feel that the
; existing form of government in the
United States is not the best that ;
can be obtained (nor do I advocate j
,a Communistic regime), and I do j
not conscientiously believe that pre-j
' i vailing economic conditions through- !
, out the land are the direct result I
of mismanagement and inefficiency
in the present governmental setup.
Due to the limitation of space in |
the Daily, I will confine my argu
ments to a matter that is now be
fore us; a matter that is possibly
but a trivial detail in the workings
iof our legislative and executive
departments, but a matter that is
, sufficiently understood by the deni
i zens of the Farm to at least afford
' a valid field for attack.
To wit: the latest toy of the
! United States Navy that was con
< structed at a cost of some five mil
> lions of dollars of good hard legal
i ( tender donated by you, by me, and
I | the rest of the suckers that stand
I by and let our Congressmen appro
' priate money for useless and wan
i tonly extravagant purposes. Need
'l less to say, I speak of the Akron

that has just recently arrived in our
community. Now this Ls the way the
wheels of government go around:
Admiral so-and-so gets a hot idea
that the Navy needs a big gas bag
to play with, for Ihe small airplanes,
the unwieldy battleships, and the
other toys of depredation are not
sufficiently novel to amuse himself
and his subordinates. Admiral goes
to Cabinet Head, Cabinet Head goes
to Congressman, and Congressman
goes to orating for an appropriation
for one dirigible to be constructed
for the Navy "in the interests of
the advancement of aviation, and in
the development of technical ability
to operate lighter-than-air-craft,
matters that are so vital to the
maintenance of domestic tranquility
and the protection from foreign in
vasion and aggression." The'silvery
tones of the Congressman's voice,

I his fiery diplomacy, and the inces- f
| sant rush of Congress to get things f
over with and to get on to more c
J pressing matters or to get out to f
I the golf course, soon manage to c
I furnish the Navy with the big piece \
j of boloney. j >
