THE WEST COAST RELAYS
may not have produced all the
world records that various
chambers of commerce hud
hoped for, hut it certainly pro
vided some excellent times, dis
tances, and potential Olympic
stars.
First, and foremost, because fans
jp here seem never to have heard
>f him, we would like to introduce
Vlr. Meeks, of Occidental College,
rhis young man, who incidentally
s not just a flash in the pan, finally
|ave the rail-birds an idea of what
le is really capable of by topping'
he highs, college class, in 14.5. This
a a mere .3 of a second faster than
he time in the university highs, and
1 slower than the Penn Relays
nark of this year over which the
Sastern critics have cheered long
md loudly.
THAT lIIGII JUMP, which is
coming in for a good deal of
official inspection right now, was
lirst reported to the press box
as a win for Will Brannan at 6
feet, s'a inches. Bob Van Osdel
was given second place, height
unannounced, and Stewart and
Lassailette were said to have
tied for third.
Where Goldstein came from is a
:omplete mystery, unless he was
ust naturally overlooked in the re
,ults. The suspicion that is being
hrown around the results came up
jefore anyone knew that they might
nean victory. In fact, the L.A.A.C.
lad U.S.C. whipped thoroughly un
il the Club was disqualified in the
ust track event of the evening, the
nile relay.
And if anyone thought that
that relay was queer, they
should have taken a look al the
college class mile relay. There
was more trick lane running and
cutting in during the course of
that race than was produced
during the rest of the meet.
