# Frosh Flash to 1-0 Soccer Victory Over Seniors
## YEARLINGS ANNEX INTERCLASS TITLE IN DECIDING GAME Sutow, Fast Wing, Scores Only Goal; Brownton, White Also Star 
### 
Scoring once in the first five min
utes of play and then holding their
more ' experienced opponents score
less for the remaining portion of the
game, a fighting freshman soccer
team defeated the senior interclass
outfit 1-0 yesterday on the varsity
j field to annex the championship.
The lone tally of the contest came
j after Buster Holmes, all-conference
i fullback, had seemingly kicked out
jof danger. However, inside-left
j Charlie Emerick took the kick and
j passed to Wataru Sutow on the out
i side. The flashy freshman wing
| booted the ball past goalie Williams
! from a difficult angle, and then
j helped his teammates keep the
: fourth-year men from the yearling
J goal.
Brown ton Saves Goal
The seniors came closest to scoring
j when Referee Harry Maloney
j awarded them a penalty boot at the
I goal. They elected to have Captain
j Falk make the try. His kick was
nicely placed, and came within six
inches of crossing the line, but it
I lacked the necessary punch to carry
past the "35 goalie, Paul lirownton,
whose brilliant "save" kept the
freshman in a lead which they never
relinquished.
Seniors In Poor Shape
j The seniors, most of whom ended
j their soccer careers last fall, were
| badly out of training and failed to
! show much after the first few min-
I utes of each half. The work of
Holmes, Plumb, Day, and Krumbein
probably kept the freshmen from
rolling up an even larger score.
Outstanding on the first-year out
fit were Captain White, Kennedy,
Brownton, Rojas, Emerick, and Su
; tow. The victory gives hope of an
even better varsity next fall, and
i some of the yearlings will make
! strong bids for regular berths on the
! team.
