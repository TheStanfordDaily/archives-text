' Centuries of invention and ath
letic competition have produced
' machines that pierce two hundred
miles of air in less than an hour,
and manufactured birds that flirt
! with planets, but has added only a
foot to the high jumping ability of
i man. Wearing spiked shoes per
j fected by years of careful research,
i and jumping from a minutely
| graded runway, man is still unable
: to jump seven feet into the air
, without the aid of a pole.
Harold Osborn, 1924 Olympic
' champion, established a world's rec
' ord of 6 feet, 8 11-16 inches, which
has not been exceeded since the
adoption of a new type of standard,
from which it is much easier to
i knock off the crossbar.
Simeon Toribio, most likely to
I break Osborne's record, placed
| fourth at Amsterdam behind Bob
, King, former Stanford jumper (now

j retired), and Charles Menard of
1 France. Toribio has jumped G feet,
! 61/4 inches.
j Walter Marty, the Fresno State
;heio, has cleared (i feet, 6V2 inches
j outdoors, while Anton Burg has also
I exceeded (5 feet, G inches. With a
I great field of jumpers, including
Spencer of Geneva, Jim Brannon
: and Jim Stewart of U.S.C., Parker
Shelby, Henry Lassalette, and Max
Conrad of the Los Angeles Athletic
I Club, and numerous others entered,
j the field v/ill be close.
I The Ohio State junior prom suf-
I fered a $400 deficit.
