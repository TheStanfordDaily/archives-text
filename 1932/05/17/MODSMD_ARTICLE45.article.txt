# CARD HOPES BOOM; FDR POLO VICTORY IN O.S.C. MATCHES
## Captain Fleming s Recovery Strengthens Indian Bid For Championship 
### Bill Myers 
Hopes for a Stanford victory in j
the polo tilts with Oregon State this j
week skyrocketed yesterday when j
Captain Bruce Fleming, who was j
injured in scrimmage three weeks j
ago, turned out for practice and up- j
parently seemed to be back in his j
old form.
It is still possible that Fleming \
won't be able to stand the gaff of a '
full-length game. His injury con- I
sists of a pulled jockey muscle, I
which is sometimes a stubborn j
thing to heal. Coach Dick Gordan j
is taking a chance that the Card |
captain has fully recovered, and j
will start him in the first game this j
Thursday.
The odds at stake in the series |
with the Beavers will be the Pacific j
Coast Intercollegiate championship.
The Northern riders annexed the j
i Northwest title two weeks ago, :
while Stanford grabbed the South- !
em crown at Bereseford last month, j
Oregon State has a sparkling rec- :
j ord. In indoor polo, the Beavers i
have won six out of seven games, j
Of three outdoor games played, they j
' have won two and lost one.
The Orgeon riders arrived late I
yesterday afternoon and will live on !
the campus during their stay here, j
The identical team that Stanford j
nosed out in both games of last |
year's series has been brought along j
and with one exception will line up i
in their same positions. Penney, a |
new man, may get the call instead
of O'Hanna at number three.

A barbers' war has been waged at
Alabama Polytechnic institute re
sulting in a reduction in price of
haircuts to 10 cents each.

I A resolution advocating the re
moval of bans on the teaching of
, evolution at the University of Wis
consin was passed recently.
