Ho, for the life of a cameraman. Runaway lions are not outside his
realm. This picture was taken as Leo the lion was subdued by hi 3
trainer after running amuck in a Boston radio studio. Leo was billed
to go on the air but 150 persons gathered to watch the performance
had an entirely different show. He hurled his 900-pound bulk through
a double plate glass window and bounded from room to room. Six were
hurt in the panic that ensued.
