| The Editor, Sir:
Stanford public opinion seems to
I be measured in pennies. At least
so one might judge by reading re
cent play reviews.
Introducing the subject of penny
' throwing as a topic of major im
portance in the review of an opera
is not only childish but derogatory
I to tiie intelligence of Stanford stu
dents. Perhaps many pennies are
; thrownâ€”but they are not a matter
| of which to boast on the front page
|of any university paper. With a
slight stretch of the imagination a
better news "lead" might be dis
covered by Miss Chapin.
Sincerely yours,
Royal Marten
