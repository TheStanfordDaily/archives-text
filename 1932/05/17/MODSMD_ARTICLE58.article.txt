' The Editor, Sir:
If the above letter looks as puerile
j in print as it did in proof, it should
not pass unwept, unhonored, and
unbirded. Such an earnest defense
of so tremendous a subject should
not go unrewarded. The gentleman
in his ire evidently fails to com
prehend that the review introduced
the almost total lack of coppers
thrown as a tribute to the opera.
I Obviously, too, he knows a great
deal about the writing of full-col
; limn reviews, so ready is he with
j perspicacious comments.
Would it be inappropriate to say,
"Nerts"? Sincerely,
Elizabeth Chapin
