## City Guarded As New Army Rioting Feared 
### 
TOKYO, May 17. (>P)—Kisaburo
Suzuki, home minister, accepted the
presidency of the Seiyukai (govern
ment) party today and thus became
virtually certain of succeeding the
assassinated Suyoshi Inukai as Jap
an's premier.
His formal agreement to fill the
late premier's place in the Seiyukai's
leadership averted dissensions that
threatened to split the ruling party.
Eldermen of the party, who decided
to support him, persuaded Takejiro
Tokonami, railway minister, another
possible candidate, to give up his
ambition for the presidency.
Mass Meeting
Mr. Suzuki will be formally in
stalled as president of the party at
a mass meeting of the Seiytkai's
parliamentary members this ai'ter
noon. It was taken for granted he
would be the next premier in ac
cordance with Japanese custom.
Fascism in Japan apparently suf
fered a setback when as a result of
Premier Inukai's assassination the
military council decided yesterday to
replace General Sadao Araki, lead
ing nationalist, as minister of war.
New War Minister
Lieutenant Genei"al Jinzaburo Ma
saki, vice-chief of the army general
staff, was chosen by the military
council to take over the war port
folio regardless of whether the cabi
net, under Acting Premier Korekiyo
Takahashi, eventually stands or falls.
Tokyo was guarded by police re
serves against a terrorist plot of
young army and naval cadets to
seize the capital after its outbreak,
but it apparently had collapsed with
the assassination yesterday of the
77-year-old premier, foe of militar
ism and veteran of representative
government in Japan, and a scries of
shootings and bombings.
