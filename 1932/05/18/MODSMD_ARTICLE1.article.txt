Story Pure Fiction
From the start to finish, he con
'ssed, the creatures of whom he
ilked so glibly, the criminals with
/horn he conferred, the seagoing
lieves who signaled him by radio,
nd the ghost ship upon which the
idna'ped baby was supposed to be
nder the care of a trained nurse—
11 were figments of his imagination.
While the shipbuilder was impli
ating himself and the clergyman in
he monstrous fake, a Long Island
um runner, arrested in Brooklyn
}r abandonment, was confessing
nat he was one of the kidnapers.
The latter, Frank Parzych, 29, a
arcotics addict, gave a detailed ac
ount in which he said he and six
ther members of a liquor smug
ling crew had driven to the Lind
ergh home and that two of the
len had snatched the baby.
Tot Kilcd in Fall
The child was killed, he said,
/hen the kidnaper who had taken
from its crib fell as he was de
fending the ladder propped against
ie Lindbergh home.
Every device known to police of
cials was used to trip Parzych in
is account, but not once did he
ontradict himself. Police Commis
ioner Edward Mulrooney, who
jnducted the interrogation person
lly, said the man's recital "ap
eared to ring true."
Curtis Sorry
Curtis said in part:
"I never knew such people I
amed to Colonel Lindbergh, they
'ere creatures of a distorted mind
nth the exception of Marie Trues
ale, who had no connection with
ie crime.
"I exceedingly regret that I caused
Colonel Lindbergh and others any
iconvenience and wish it were in
ly power to correct my wrong."
