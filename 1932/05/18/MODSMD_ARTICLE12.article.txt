# FORTY ENTERED IN HORSE SHOW
## Drawings Made Yesterday; Six Eliminated 
### 
| Over forty men are listed as en
j trants in Stanford's 13th Annual
! Horse Show, June 3.
Drawings for horses was done
yesterday afternoon when the aspir
| ing prize-winners picked the num
| ber of their choice from a hat. The
j heaviest number of entrants was in
the Touch and Out, Musical Chairs,
and the Potato Race. Nearly thirty
i men were entered in these events
| after a half-dozen had been elimi
! nated by drawing blanks.
j Touch and Out is a jumping event.
The bars are set at three feet and
the horses are automatically dis
qualified upon touching the hurdles
or by refusing to jump.
In the Musical chairs event, the
riders canter around a bunch of
chairs set in the middle of the pen.
There is one less chair than the
j number of riders. A whistle is
| blotan and the riders dismount and
| scramble for a chair. The man left
without a chair is disqualified each
time until there is but one rider
leftâ€”the winner.
The Potato Race is something akin
to bobbing for apples. Each rider
must ride up to a pail containing
eight potatoes, spear one with a
pointed stick, gallop back to the
I starting line, drop it and go after
j another one, until all eight spuds
j arc carried back in this fashion.
