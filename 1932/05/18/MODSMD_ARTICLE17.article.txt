### 
Solution For The Depression No.
3000:
If you're a victim of hard times,
without work, conic to Stanford and
get a job.
Over GO per cent of tho men on the
Farm are able to attend classes and
in addition earn part or all of their
expenses, an Appointment Office
survey shows.
Twenty per cent of Stanford
women will be able to make casual
remarks to their grandchildren about
"putting my way through college."
Student earnings aggregate over
a quarter of a million dollars yearly.
The most popidar method of mak
ing money is "hashing," over 800
men and women having jobs dishing
out food; dishing out jazz also brings

! in the coin of the realm to dozens
j of students.
i Among the unique methods of
|j snaring stray dimes and nickels may
; ! be mentioned painting flagpoles,
| catching poisonous snakes, minding
j professors' babies, crooning, and pre-
I paring corpses for laboratories.
Students are gardeners, artists,
! publicity men, newspaper correspon
j dents, professional actors and ac-
I j tresses, cooks, and gasoline dispens
i crs.
In the summer the range of ac
tivities widens. One student works
â–  as a master of ceremonies, another
ships on tramp freighters and writes
stories about his adventures during
lithe following autumn, while others
j find positions as forest rangers, life
. | guards, and lumberjacks.
