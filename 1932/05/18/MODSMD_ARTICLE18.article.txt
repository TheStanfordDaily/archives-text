# BRUINS, BEARS TO AID CARDS AGAINST TROY
## Sole Chance Stanford May Have Depends On How Others Perform 
### Dick Strouse 
Stanford's track team is going to |
be cheering loud and lustily for the j
spikemen of California and U.C.L.A. j
in Saturday's California Intercolle
giates. |
For although the Indians haven't |
much more of a chance to nose oul '
U.S.C. than has any track team in j
any meet, still what opportunity
does exist for a Cardinal victory
depends on points that Bear and j
Bruin athletes will detract from the
Trojan total.
Kicsel in Sprints
Boh Kiesel, from the "hated"
Berkeley rival, is Stanford's ace to -j
throw against the Trojans Saturday. !
The California bullet may be able !
to take WykofT, Delby, and Ball ot
U.S.C. in both dashes, which will
help the Card cause even though |
Stanford probably won't even have ;
a sprinter entered in the meet.
Captain George Pool, also from :
California, may have another good
day, although this is extremely im- j
probable as Mr. Pool vaults well j
but once every year and his 1932 !
effort came in the Big. Meet. So il j
will be up to Miller, DeGroot, and .
Johns of Stanford to take Bill Gra
ber of U.S.C. Ned Johns, by the j
way, should be in fine shape as he
won a half-dozen or so milk-shakes j
yesterday when he cleared 12 feet \
6 inches in practice to gladden Bill j
Ellington's and Bert DeGroot's
hearts and replenish their pocket- ;
books.
Other Bears to Help
Other Bears who may help the !
Cards are Mansell in the high-jump, ;
Deßerry in the weights, Lee in the ,
two-mile, Raftery in the mile, and
Miles, Pierce, and Waterbury in the
javelin. It is probable that Lee will
trail Callahan of U.S.C. and Am- j
dahl of Stanford in the eight-lap
grind and that Raftery will find Jim j
Ferrie (who hopes for revenge for :
the Bear sophomore's surprise win j
over him in the Big Meet) and 1
Troy's Halstead too much for his |
best efforts.
If there were five instead of four ;
places in the various events and if J
four instead of three entries per \
team were allowed, Stanford's I
chances would be greatly helped. '
For George Grey, the fourth best!
Indian in both the shot and the dis- j
cus might well be able to nose out I
Hall of U.S.C. in both events. As it j
is, Deßerry and the three Stanford |
entries may shut out the Trojans in j
the weights, but it so happens that i
Deßerry's points will not count to- j
ward the Stanford total.
Jefferson Is Threat
The only real U.C.L.A. threat is j
Jefferson in the pole-vault, although j
Chuck Smith may get a point or so
in the dashes. But even if Kiesel
and Smith bust up the Trojon trio
in the dashes, Miles and Pierce of
California beat Williamson of U.S.C.
in the javelin, and Hall doesn't
place in the weights, it will still
take a miracle (with Ben Eastman
running only the quarter) for Stan- j
ford to win.
