# 'Disarmament Is Means to World Peace'--Guerard
## Lecturer Explains Feeling Of French People 
### 
| Stating that the issue of world
peace is not between France and
; America, but one of international
! import, Dr. Albert Guerard, profes
i sor of German and Comparative
! Literature, spoke last night in the
I Assembly Hall on "France in Inter
national Affairs."
"World peace implies world or- !
' ganization," Guerard said, calling the j
i American doctrine of isolation a !
] "romantic sentiment working against !
peace." Confidence and disarma- |
|ment, he named as the means toward i
world peace. America is spreading
her gospel of nationalism, and work- j
ing against the French proposition j
for an international army because
j she believes it is French, the speaker j
j said. Citing and refuting the objec- i
I tions to the proposal, he mentioned j
I that the plrfn was Wilson's, enforced !
1 by Hoover.
"The American ideal is peace," i
i Guerard stated, but American repre
j sentatives object because it has j
i found an each in France. The debt |
| question, he said, resolves itself into j
I the ability to pay. France cannot j
1 pay until Germany pays the war
! debt to her, and Germany cannot j
pay both France and America, he j
l contended. The Hoover Moratorium, j
; seemingly a generous and diploma-
I tic act of America, left France un
| protected for the use Germany
i might put the surplus to, he contin
: ued, and France cannot be blamed i
j for hesitating to accept it.
The American proposal to settle |
| the armament dispute, Guerard said,
| was unfair to the French nation,
: leaving her less than the necessary
j facilities to take care of her outposts,
j and working the parity clause only
j partially. America, with her policy
j of isolation, had no right to interfere |
j in European land armament qucs- i
| tions, Guerard contended, and over- i
j looked the French natural demand i
j for security.
