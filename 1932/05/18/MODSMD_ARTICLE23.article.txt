# BARCLAY TALKS TO BUSINESS MEN
## 
### 
Professor Thomas S. Barclay, of
the Political Science department,
spoke at the Stanford Business Club
dinner last night on the activities of
the Democratic Party in the coming
campaign.
"Nineteen-thirty-two is the year
of golden opportunity for the Demo
cratic party," he said. "It is the fifth
time in seventy years that the
Democrats have entered the presi
dential campaign with a good chance
of winning the election. The Demo
crats might capitalize the discontent
of the people with the present con
ditions and win the election on the
purely negative issue of 'anything
for a change.'
Barclay brought out iho possibil
ity of Newton D. Baker's becoming
the 1932 Democratic nominee, as he
is well-fitted to lead the country to
some new world position. Baker is
in ;i very strategic position for the
nomination, as he has not been in
partisan politics since 1921, and
hense has no strong policies nor
enemies and is also the inheritor of
thÂ« Wilsonian tradition, which gives
him ri strong position in the South.
