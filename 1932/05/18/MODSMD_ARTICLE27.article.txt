# TRACK RATTLES
## 
### 
i rack is generally considered one of the few sports
that, by their nature, are not subject lo disputes over rules
and officiating. Foot racing, throwing, and jumping are not
complicated activities. On the contrary, they are probably
the simplest and most natural of all sporting contests. Yet
during the past year or two Pacific Coast track meets have
frequently been featured by charges of-foul tactics or ques
tionable sportsmanship on one side or the other.
This season the trouble has been particularly noticeable.
In tlii- Rig Meet there was an argument over the two mile;
in the I .S.C. meet Wocssner was alleged to have fouled
Eastman in Ihe relay, and other accusations were bruited
about; til Fresno last week the Trojans and the Los Angeles
Athletic (dub became embroiled over the outcome of three
events.
Some ol these rows had no real basis, but the majority
of I hem were caused, directly or indirectly, by poor work
on Ihe part of the meet olficials. Apparently considering
their duties merely nominal, inspectors and judges have
been 100 casual in watching the progress of events under
their charge. Illegal boxes, cutting in, and similar offenses
have been overlooked, either because the official immedi
ately concerned was not looking, because he did not know
Ihe rules, or because he did not care to enforce Ihem. Care
lessness in checking the entrants has also been a source of
confusion.
I lie obvious result of lax control of the meets is a feel
ing on the part of competitors that they can get away with
minor rule violations so long as they don't pull anything too
raw. It is probable that many fouls have resulted from this
belief, whereas a strict regime would have made the ath
letes careful to stay within Ihe law.
The obvious remedy is lo select qualified and conscien
tious men. The referees and important judges have usually
been of the highest caliber; it is not at their door that blame
is to be laid. Rut too often minor officials, such as judges
on the turns, have been chosen from Ihe lirst men that came
to hand. If track managers will, in Ihe future, exercise
more care in this phase of staging meets, much regrettable
argument should be avoided.
