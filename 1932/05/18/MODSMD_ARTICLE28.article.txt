# SCIENTIFIC HONOR PROBE

### 
Approximately il per con I of I lie students at Columbia
I diversity crib in examinations. So concluded the Specta
tor, student newspaper of that institution, last week after
tabulating the results of a questionnaire answered by KM)
undergraduates. Asserting that the replies were made "in
good faith," the publication went on to reveal that three
per ccnl confessed to "habitual" cheating, while the re
mainder admitted that they do il only "occasionally."
Either startling frankness, this, or perhaps only evi
dence of a rare sense of humor among Columbians. Ques
tionnaire results of all varieties a frequency to justify sus
picion that, having become exceedingly tired of laying bare
their souls before a gaping public, studies are beginning
to forcsakc truthfulness for the thrill of sensationalism.
However that may be, the idea is sound. In this age of
advanced scientific method, few would dream of reaching
conclusions in any social science without first having sought
out the facts. W'hv, then, should persons argue for or
against honor systems without knowing how many stu
dents crib in examinations?
II might be worth a try at Stanford, for the past many
years a heated battleground of honor code argument.
