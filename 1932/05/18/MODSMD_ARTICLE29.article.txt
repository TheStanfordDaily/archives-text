High schools are turning out .stu
dents without the ability to think.
That was one of the opinions at
tributed to Dr. Murray of our clas
sical literature department in an in
terview in yesterday's Daily. I wish
somebody had asked him whether
colleges train thinkers. It is as
sumed in many circles that the pur
pose of a university is to teach the
student how to think. In those cir
cles it is felt that to question
whether something so venerable as
a college is fulfilling its purpose is
unthinkable, sacreligious, and plain
"Bolshevistic."
Democracy has its advantages. But
one of its terrific disadvantages is
that it assumes that what is good
for one person is of necessity just
the thing for everybody. All men
are equal. All have the right to buy
a Packard (advt.). All should be
educated, and all should think. That
idea is not questioned except by the
actual conditions. What that theory
forgets is that not all care to exer
cise the painful effort which think
ing—or trying to think—requires.
The great ideals of mass-produc
tion and war-time efficiency were
carried over into every field—in
cluding higher education. Fill those
classrooms! Jam this campus! With
such stirring slogans, the merry
work went on. And the success was
assured because from the outside
there was also steady pressure. Does
he wear a necktie? Does he go to
college? Both were equally neces
sary social requisites. More people

THINKERS?

came to college, It was profitable to
come to university; college gradu
ates made more money. The stream
to institutions of higher learning
became a raging torrent.
How can a university even begin to
make "thinkers" out of its students?
They do not come to develop the
gray matter. They come to carry off
social and economic weapons. A
cultural, thoughtful education is
largely incompatible with the pres
ent motives, if the University de
sired, it could mold its students.
But this is not done. The collegians
are allowed immense freedom in se
lecting courses. Of course we are
old enough—assuming that even
high-school students have electivcs.
But we choose our courses to ful
fill the ideals or lack thereof that
we bring with us to college. It seems
that the University should decide
to what an educated man should be
exposed. Then it should deliberate
ly force all people to take those
courses. Students let loose in a maze
of subjects—will of course follow
the easiest path. They will take too
many courses which have little
more thought-producing power than
"manicuring and window-dressing"
which Dr. Murray mentioned as
non-desirable in high schools.
If it is impossible to create cul
tured thinking beings out of most
college students, then let us cease
speaking of a university as if that
were its purpose. If it is possible,
let administrations work toward that
goal. —Abe Mellinkoff

ly force all people to take those
courses. Students let loose in a maze
of subjects—will of course follow
the easiest path. They will take too
many courses which have little
more thought-producing power than
"manicuring and window-dressing"
which Dr. Murray mentioned as
non-desirable in high schools.
If it is impossible to create cul
tured thinking beings out of most
college students, then let us cease
speaking of a university as if that
were its purpose. If it is possible,
let administrations work toward that
goal. —Abe Mellinkoff
High schools are turning out .stu
dents without the ability to think.
That was one of the opinions at
tributed to Dr. Murray of our clas
sical literature department in an in
terview in yesterday's Daily. I wish
somebody had asked him whether
colleges train thinkers. It is as
sumed in many circles that the pur
pose of a university is to teach the
student how to think. In those cir
cles it is felt that to question
whether something so venerable as
a college is fulfilling its purpose is
unthinkable, sacreligious, and plain
"Bolshevistic."
Democracy has its advantages. But
one of its terrific disadvantages is
that it assumes that what is good
for one person is of necessity just
the thing for everybody. All men
are equal. All have the right to buy
a Packard (advt.). All should be
educated, and all should think. That
idea is not questioned except by the
actual conditions. What that theory
forgets is that not all care to exer
cise the painful effort which think
ing—or trying to think—requires.
The great ideals of mass-produc
tion and war-time efficiency were
carried over into every field—in
cluding higher education. Fill those
classrooms! Jam this campus! With
such stirring slogans, the merry
work went on. And the success was
assured because from the outside
there was also steady pressure. Does
he wear a necktie? Does he go to
college? Both were equally neces
sary social requisites. More people

THINKERS?

came to college, It was profitable to
come to university; college gradu
ates made more money. The stream
to institutions of higher learning
became a raging torrent.
How can a university even begin to
make "thinkers" out of its students?
They do not come to develop the
gray matter. They come to carry off
social and economic weapons. A
cultural, thoughtful education is
largely incompatible with the pres
ent motives, if the University de
sired, it could mold its students.
But this is not done. The collegians
are allowed immense freedom in se
lecting courses. Of course we are
old enough—assuming that even
high-school students have electivcs.
But we choose our courses to ful
fill the ideals or lack thereof that
we bring with us to college. It seems
that the University should decide
to what an educated man should be
exposed. Then it should deliberate
ly force all people to take those
courses. Students let loose in a maze
of subjects—will of course follow
the easiest path. They will take too
many courses which have little
more thought-producing power than
"manicuring and window-dressing"
