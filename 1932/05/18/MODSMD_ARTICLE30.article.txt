The Editor, Sir: j
These few words are intended to |
be a criticism of the evident policy i
pursued by this great "Dippy" of '
ours, which is to allow nothing to '
pass without its due share of bitter j
criticism, exposing every failing and '
rarely extending approbation.
It was with a great deal of sur- 1
prise and joy that I read the re- ;
viewer's comment of the Junior j
Opera in the paper last Monday and j
found that "the Devil had been j
given his due" and that the Opera 1
was well criticized, its failings be- i
ing exposed and its good points j
being given full emphasis. But, 10, j
with the dawn of a new morning j
comes the Great Editor's remarks,
seemingly tipped in vitriol and
spite, which informed the world
that the Opera had been a "two
hour torture" and a "hash of third
rate vaudeville and cheap melo
drama."
Until I had had the extreme
honor of reading this series of com
ments by the Great Editor, an en
tirely different idea had prevailed
in my mind as to the success of the
production. The general concensus
of opinion of all of those to whom
I talked about the opera (and they
have been many) was that it was
very enjoyable, in fact Ihe best that
has been produced in the last three
years. The chorus was good and
well-trained, and most of the char
acters were well-chosen and played
their parts well, headed, of course,
by Eph Engleman, whose every en
trance was a call for humor and
approbation.
Some of us around this institu
tion still enjoy going to see a pro
duction such as our Junior Opera,
embodying student efTort of every
type—composing, writing, dancing,
singing, and acting—and are able
lo derive enough pleasure from such
a show to make up for the evident
shortcomings that arise due to lack
of time to practice and lack of suit
able facilities for presentation. We
rather enjoy watching people we
know put over "moss-covered gags"
and do their best to sing, dance, and
act for our approval.
I am sure that the members of
the cast sincerely apologize to the
Great Editor for insulting his intel
ligence, as he says was done in his
editorial, and join their best wishes
to hope for its recovery to nor
malcy. It really must be a very
delicate and dninty organism to be
so highly bored and insulted while
all others around it were enabled
to enjoy themselves.
In all due fairness, I must say

BEST OPERA IN YEARS!

| that 1 agree with the Editor ("great)
jin one thing, and that is that the
; price of the seats was too high.
' Many students couldn't afford to
! pay that much, especially if they
j wished to date, if they were lo be
given an opportunity to see Earl
i Carroll's Vanities, Green Pastures,
| and May Robson all in one.
The closing thoughts of the edi
| torial about which I am speaking
j are especially sweet and tender—
! "About the best thing one noticed
' at the Opera was the smallness of
| tho audience, as a result of which
j the Opera went greatly in debt.''
j Possibly the audience wouldn't have
| been so small if it hadn't been for
j such editorials as this one of the
i 17th, typifying asininity and disre
; gard of the highest caliber. Out of
| fairness to the student body and to
| those members of it who strive for
j your pleasure, quit printing such
| caustic criticisms of everything
[ that's done on the campus, be it
j good or excellent, just to show the
j greatness of your "intelligence."

These few words are intended to |
be a criticism of the evident policy i
pursued by this great "Dippy" of '
ours, which is to allow nothing to '
pass without its due share of bitter j
criticism, exposing every failing and '
rarely extending approbation.
It was with a great deal of sur- 1
prise and joy that I read the re- ;
viewer's comment of the Junior j
Opera in the paper last Monday and j
found that "the Devil had been j
given his due" and that the Opera 1
was well criticized, its failings be- i
ing exposed and its good points j
being given full emphasis. But, 10, j
with the dawn of a new morning j
comes the Great Editor's remarks,
seemingly tipped in vitriol and
spite, which informed the world
that the Opera had been a "two
hour torture" and a "hash of third
rate vaudeville and cheap melo
drama."
Until I had had the extreme
honor of reading this series of com
ments by the Great Editor, an en
tirely different idea had prevailed
in my mind as to the success of the
production. The general concensus
of opinion of all of those to whom
I talked about the opera (and they
have been many) was that it was
very enjoyable, in fact Ihe best that
has been produced in the last three
years. The chorus was good and
well-trained, and most of the char
acters were well-chosen and played
their parts well, headed, of course,
by Eph Engleman, whose every en
trance was a call for humor and
approbation.
Some of us around this institu
tion still enjoy going to see a pro
