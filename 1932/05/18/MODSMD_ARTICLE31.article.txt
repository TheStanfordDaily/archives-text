j The Editor, Sir:
After reading Monday's edition of
the Daily we were impressed with
| Miss Chapin's "revue" of the Junior
! Opera since we had always been
| interested in the workings of the
j minds of our "500."
I Miss Chapin, it seems, was pleased
| with the "stellar cast" and particu
t larly with Mr. Engleman who
I "saved the day." But Miss Chapin
I wonders why the last scene was set
i in a cabaret. And why? Isn't it un
j derstood that people generally go
I to a speakeasy or a house-party in
! stead? Such a slip! Inexcusable!
In reference to Miss Chapin's
i criticism of the general plot—what
; of it? Did it accomplish its primary
i purpose: that of offering the maxi
! mum of opportunity for the display
!of campus talent. We believe that
' the author did accomplish this and
I nobly, and without the sacrifice of
i snappy dialogue or action.
Sincerely,
Gilbert Webster
Louis J. Ruschin
i P.S.: Are you "vivacious," Miss
j Chapin?
