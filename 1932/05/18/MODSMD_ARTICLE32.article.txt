# DOWN WITH CRASHERS!

The Editor, Sir:
The article written by Mr. Paul
Targhetta as his contribution to the
Women's Edition of the Daily fea
tures, along with fashion notes on
men's attire and the scholastic back
ground of what he denounces as a

self-opinionated frosh, the admis- !
sion of the rough to audit dances.
The arguments lhat Mr. Targhetta
advanced were interesting in that
not a single one would stand the
te.st of a minute's sane and critical
reflection. Allow me to briefly re
view them for his special benefit:
I. "The floor was not crowded." !
Certainly the floor was not crowd
ed; it was just right. But if you and
your great democratic brotherhood j
had surged upon the scene, crowd- |
ing those dancing into a small area
in the center of the floor, the result 1
would have been the same as a
Roblc jolly-up.
11. "The roughs could have sat in
the balcony." As a matter of fact ,
spectators could not have been ac- |
commodated in the balcony which
W£.s, for acoustical reasons I under- !
stand, draped with a large curtain, j
Then, of course, it is highly improb- |
able that the roughs, when once ad
mitted, would have gone directly to I
that balcony and stayed there.
111. "Most of the fellows didn't i
want to dance." Past experiences in- |
dicate that whether they "want to" j
or not crashers invariably do cut ;
in. But even if they don't dance, |
their crowding and wise-cracking
always detract from the pleasure of j
those who are rightfully entitled to i
enjoy themselves and have their j
wishes respected.
IV. "When admitted, the roughs
did not annoy anyone." First of all
it was 12:50 before they were ad
mitted and most of them had be
come discouraged and had gone j
home long before, and the average j
rough needs that psychological en- ,
couragement that comes from num- !
bers. Second, most roughs require
15 minutes to a half hour to "warm I
up." And, last, even the most rug- j
ged, red-headed crasher seldom has I
the nerve to try to sponge in on
the traditional and time-honored :
"last dance."
And so, Mr. Targhetta, may I take ;
the liberty to suggest that if your !
craving for music and bright lights i
again brings out the beast in you ■
this Friday evening, don't pester '
the chairman of the Prom for a free
cut on the entertainment other peo- i
pie are paying $5 to enjoy, but in- [
stead save your nickles and wait for
the next depression dance, when !
you'll be right in your element.
As for the chairman of the dance, |
Mr. Beaubaire, 1 should, rather than j
describe the flavor of his pants and
the manner in which his hair was j
combed, offer my congratulations to I
him. It was a very nice dance due, !
to a large extent, to the high de
gree of restriction placed upon the
cheap-skates that in the past have
invariably proven obnoxious to the
cash customers, and if the chairman
of the Prom shows as much good
sense as Mr. Beaubaire did, that af
fair too will be worth all the admis
sion price asked.

I. "The floor was not crowded." !
Certainly the floor was not crowd
ed; it was just right. But if you and
your great democratic brotherhood j
had surged upon the scene, crowd- |
ing those dancing into a small area
in the center of the floor, the result 1
would have been the same as a
Roblc jolly-up.
11. "The roughs could have sat in
the balcony." As a matter of fact ,
spectators could not have been ac- |
commodated in the balcony which
W£.s, for acoustical reasons I under- !
stand, draped with a large curtain, j
Then, of course, it is highly improb- |
able that the roughs, when once ad
mitted, would have gone directly to I
that balcony and stayed there.
111. "Most of the fellows didn't i
want to dance." Past experiences in- |
dicate that whether they "want to" j
or not crashers invariably do cut ;
in. But even if they don't dance, |
their crowding and wise-cracking
always detract from the pleasure of j
those who are rightfully entitled to i
enjoy themselves and have their j
wishes respected.
IV. "When admitted, the roughs
did not annoy anyone." First of all
it was 12:50 before they were ad
mitted and most of them had be
come discouraged and had gone j
home long before, and the average j
rough needs that psychological en- ,
couragement that comes from num- !
bers. Second, most roughs require
15 minutes to a half hour to "warm I
up." And, last, even the most rug- j
ged, red-headed crasher seldom has I
the nerve to try to sponge in on
the traditional and time-honored :
"last dance."
And so, Mr. Targhetta, may I take ;
the liberty to suggest that if your !
craving for music and bright lights i
again brings out the beast in you ■
this Friday evening, don't pester '
the chairman of the Prom for a free
cut on the entertainment other peo- i
pie are paying $5 to enjoy, but in- [
stead save your nickles and wait for
the next depression dance, when !
you'll be right in your element.
As for the chairman of the dance, |
Mr. Beaubaire, 1 should, rather than j
describe the flavor of his pants and
the manner in which his hair was j
combed, offer my congratulations to I
him. It was a very nice dance due, !
to a large extent, to the high de
gree of restriction placed upon the
cheap-skates that in the past have
invariably proven obnoxious to the
cash customers, and if the chairman
of the Prom shows as much good
sense as Mr. Beaubaire did, that af
fair too will be worth all the admis
sion price asked.

The article written by Mr. Paul
Targhetta as his contribution to the
Women's Edition of the Daily fea
tures, along with fashion notes on
men's attire and the scholastic back
ground of what he denounces as a

self-opinionated frosh, the admis- !
sion of the rough to audit dances.
The arguments lhat Mr. Targhetta
advanced were interesting in that
not a single one would stand the
te.st of a minute's sane and critical
reflection. Allow me to briefly re
view them for his special benefit:
