The Editor, Sir:
After carefully reading the argu
ments advanced by both Stan Beau- j
baire and Paul Targhetta, both of
whom are friends of mine, I am
constrained to write a campus opin
ion. The most inciting point of Paul's
article was his statement that the
"roughs will bo admitted to the
Junior prom after twelve or . . j
The situation as I see it is this, I
(1) Recognizing the lack of funds, :
cai', or whatever makes a x*ough j
want to go to a dance rough, the
officials would be glad to admit
them if they would come in quietly
and just watch from the balcony, j
but (2) they must, out of fairness j
to those fellows who have bought ]
bids to the dance, keep as much of !
the usually crowded quarters as !
possible for dancing and they must j
make sure that the fellow who has
paid has an opportunity to dance
with the girl instead of being cut in
upon every few seconds.

In the past whenever roughs have
been admitted to dances there have
been at first a few peaceful-minded
fellows who just wanted to watch,
such as Targhetta himself, but as

soon as the word spread around the |
campus a great flock of roughs have j
descended and crowded in upon the
dancers, lessening the available
space and practically ruining things
for those fellows who had brought !
dates. The few peaceful-minded l
ones after watching some of the
roughs cutting in decided that their j
peaceful state of mind was a handi- j
cap and jumped in to the fray.
The Junior Class, believing that .
the roughs in the class should have
their opportunity and not be annoy
ing to Prom goers by cutting in to
dance with girls clad in white and >
light-colored dresses, and dirtying j
them with their cords, held a cord
ball last Saturday afternoon. The
purpose of the ball was to take care
of this very problem.
And so 1 think that despite what
ever happened last Friday night, i
Paul should wisely forget his im- ;
plied threat for the Prom, and ii !
he must be a rough go to some j
place in San Francisco where roughs !
are welcome.
