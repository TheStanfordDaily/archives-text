At sea again
Ship ahoy! Did any of you ever
try to be a sailor? Or did you ever
try skinning a live tom-cat and
studying Renaissance history at the
same time? Well, did you ever try
crossing the Atlantic in what they
call a May "squall"? We thought
not, or you wouldn't be the fine,
stalwart, upright U.S. citizen that
you are today.
Such a business! The well
known bed-slat that the old poet
sings about would be a gravy
train after this; but we haven't
yet discovered the proper meth
od of stoppings a transoceanic
steamer, telling 'em you're tired
of tossing, and prefer to walk
the rest of the way.
There is no one, absolutely no
one, who's worth knowing, on board.
If there were, we couldn't appre
ciate it, and anyway it's a little late
in the year to start trailing the
wealthies in hopes of small and
sundry donations for the dear old
college back home. So . . .
We've tried every known means
of preventing seasickness, from
standing on our head to counting
sheep outside the port-hole. Some
-1 how, they don't seem to work. May
be they're remedies for something
else.
We even tried reading a good,
wholesome book, to see if that
wotdd help. Thought we might

write a review of it for the
Daily-Dully, or something. So
we started on (ieorge Eliot, and
after three pages decided we
knew enough to write a review,
and started in. It reads: "(ieorge
Eliot's style is crisp and very
rancid . . There seems to he
something wrong with that, too.
Meanwhile, the waves roll on, ui
we understand there's nothing d<
ing on the old Farm, not even mu<
of excitement on the track. Oh, f
a place where nothing was happei
ing, just for five minutes . . . B
we must be ever optimistic, so . .
Come on over the water's fine .
