# CARD RACING AUTO SETS NEW TIMES IN FIVE CONTESTS
## Body, Engine Designed By Stanford Professor And Instructor 
### 
Five world records for C-class
racing automobiles, including the
world's mile record for all four
cylinder cars of unlimited displace- ,
ment, were smashed yesterday at
Muroc Dry Lake, near Mohave, by
an automobile developed by a Stan
ford professor and an instructor.
Professor Elliott G. Reid of the
Guggenheim Aerodynamics labora
tory here designed the body on j
radically new lines embodying
aerodynamic principals. This is the
first time a small automobile has
been scientifically sircam-lined, Pro
lessor Elliott said.
Changes in the Miller racing en- j
gine were made by Ulysses A. Pat- ,
ehett, instructor in mechanical en- I
gineering here, and they resulted in |
greatly increased smoothness of en- I
gine operation at high speeds. The i
power has probably also been in- j
creased somewhat, although tests
have not yet been made.
A notable aspect of the achieve- i
mentis that the newly designed car
is a two-seater, carrying a mechanic |
as well as a driver, while all the ;
records it broke were made by one- j
seat cars, which are smaller and j
lighter.
The car will be entered in the j
500-mile classic at Indianapolis May I
30. The Muroc Dry Lake speed j
trials were sanctioned by the Amer- I
ican Automobile Association.
