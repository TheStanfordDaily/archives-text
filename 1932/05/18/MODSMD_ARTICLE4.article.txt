# FROSH OGLE AS ENCINA DISPLAYS WIKIES FOR "500"
## 
### 
Encina has "gone Roble"!
So decided some 400 bewil
dered freshmen last night as
one of the new Wikie suits for
women, which consists of a pair
of trunks and a brassiere-like
upper, made its appearance in
the display window of the En
cina haberdashery.
Realizing the value of the
power of suggestion in sales
manship, the proprietors evi
dently decided that the best
manner in which to contact ihe
fair "500" was to let the ogling
frosh see what the gill of his
dreams would look like in this
latest creation for feminine
aquatic fans. The persuasive
powers of some 400-odd in
mates of Encina are to be con
sidered as of quite some value
when concentrated on the fair
onef of Roble and the How.
