# Polomen Will Face Tough Beaver Team
## Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Polo Championship To Be At Stake; Visitors Hold Northwest Title 
### BILL MYERS 
AS THE Oregon State poloists jogged a few of their ponies around the \
Encina field in a light afternoon exercising, Captain Norman 11. Me- !
Mahon, eoaeh of the Beaver riders, told his opinion of the chances of the j
Oregon Staters in the championship series with Stanford tomorrow and :
Saturday. "It looks pretty close," the Beaver mentor said, "I haven't
seen your boys in many practices yet, but just from all the reports I hear, |
we seem t obe in for a tough battle."*' I

'"We have the same team as we
had last yearâ€”and with this extra
year of experience and particularly
in playing together we have im
proved a lot. The team has a fine
record in indoor polo this season,
but we're a little short of practice
outdoors."
Oregon State's record in indoor
polo which Captain McMahon re
ferred to incidentally consists of six
games won out of seven played. In
outdoor polo, the Beavers defeated
a Vancouver army team with an aid
of a handicap in two games out of
three. The Vancouver outfit is rated
as one of the flashiest in the North
west.
Indian Record Steady
Stanford's record is not quite as
sparkling, but still is by no means
a poor one. The Redshirts have won
seven games out of eleven, but. three
of the seven games won were with
inexperienced teams and could
scarcely be classed as anything but
set-ups.
The Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
polo championship will be at stake
when the teams clash. Oregon State
won the Northwest litle two weeks
ago while Stanford grabbed the
crown of the Southern Division at
Beresford last month. Both games
of the series must be won to get the
coast championship.
The opening tilt starts at 4 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon on the highway
field.
