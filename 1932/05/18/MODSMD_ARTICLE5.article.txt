# 300 Perish In Holocaust On French Vessel
## Survivors Tell Of Hundred Burned To Death 
### 
I ADEN, Arabia, May 17. (/P>â€”Ship
ping agencies feared that more than
300 persons may have perished
aboard the blazing French motor
| ship Georges Philippar off Cape
I Guardafui, Italian Somaliland, as 254
haggard, smoke-grimed survivors
arrived here today.
The British steamers Contractor
and Mahsud brought the first refu
gees, who reported that up to 100
passengers were trapped in their
burning cabins yesterday. Another
420 survivors we: - e understood to be
on the French liner Andre Lebon,
which took them off the soviet
| tanker Sovietskai Neft.
Shipping experts said they be
lieved at least 1000 persons were
aboard the lost vessel, and that un
] less they were picked up by ships
i which have not yet reported by
I wireless, or have reached the African
j coast in boats, hundreds must have
j met death.
Racked with anxiety for the safety
| of relatives and friends, the surviv
| ors who arrived here told of har
j rowing scenes that ended the ship's
| maiden voyage in tragedy.
The survivors could not say how
I many lives were lost in the ship.
Up to 100, they said, were trapped
I in the burning cabins, most of them
jin the first class section. It seemed
j impossible all could have survived.
