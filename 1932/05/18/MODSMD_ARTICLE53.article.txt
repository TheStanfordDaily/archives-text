INDIVIDUAL BATTLES will |
furnish all the interest at the Cali- !
fornia Intercollegiates at Berkeley '
Saturday. As far as team honors are >
concerned, there won't be even a
slight argument.
Time was when it looked as if
Stanford would have a fair chance i
to stop U.S.C. in this meet, with
California and U.C.L.A. eating into ,
Troy's favorite events, but them
days is gone forever, what with the j
Hables brothers on the shelf again
and Giberson in the hospital.
Nothing short of an earthquake |
could keep those Trojans from cop- I
, ping first team honors, while Stan- I
j ford, California, and U.C.L.A. will'
I tag along in that order.
. .
THOSE AFOREMENTIONED
individual battles should make
the meet well worth the trek
across the bay, however. The
headline event will be the re
j turn meeting at 100 yards be-

tween Bob Kiesel, California's
track hater, and Frankic Wv
kolT, the injured Trojan who is
tired of it all.
Kiesel will have to make bis
bid for revenge in the century,
because Wykoff has definitely
announced he will not run the
220. It will be recalled that Wy
koff beat Kiesel in 0.8 seconds
on a slow track in the Califor
nia -U.S.C. meet early in the
season, and then was scratched
from the 220 at the last minute.
Since that time Kiesel has run
the century in 9.5 seconds, and
may give the Glcndalc Flyer
quite a race Saturday.
BEN EASTMAN will run only
two events, the quarter-mile and
the relay. The former will be "no
contest," but Stanford's chances of
winning the latter do not look par
ticularly promising with Captain Ike
Hables laid up again.
