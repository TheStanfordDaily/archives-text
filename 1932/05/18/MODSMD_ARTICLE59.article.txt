Stan Anderson, who will probably
| hurl Friday's encounter with Rik
kyo University, was on the mound
for one of the pick-up teams and
, looked to have lost little of the
speed which made him Stanford's
most dependable chucker this

trol which he will have back by
! game time, the fact that he can still
; burn them across the plate gives
Farm fans high hopes for a win
j over the invaders.
j Besides being noted for their
speed on the bases and their ability
| to squeeze runs across the plafe,

j far from their invasion, which has
carried them from Seattle to New
Haven and back again, they have
lost to the University of Washing
ton 1-0, beaten them 0-4, and de
feated Yale by the convincing score
