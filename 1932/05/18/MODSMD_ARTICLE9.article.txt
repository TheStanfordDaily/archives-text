## 88 Slain As British Halt Hindu Race Strife 
### 
BOMBAY, India, May 17. (/P)—
j Hindu and Moslem mobs were
i quieted tonight by the rifle fire of
British troops after four days of
| communal rioting that took a total
I of eighty-eight lives and wounded
j at least 850 persons.
Twenty-four were killed today
and 200 injured before the soldiers
: who had been rushed here from
Poona had restored order. But the
I sti-ife between the two hostile races
' meanwhile had spread to Calcutta
j where police were forced to fire on
j a mob. Several constables and about
! twenty civilians were injured.
The trouble at Calcutta apparently
I began when Hindus stationed on
J housetops stoned a Moslem religious
procession. The Moslems retaliated.
For the most part during the day
| the populace shuddered indoors as
j the blood continued to flow in the
! shambles of several Bombay dis-
J tricts. British tanks, also rushed
'■ from Poona, patroled the streets.
Groups of more than five persons
i were prohibited by a curfew order
I from congregating in any spot.
