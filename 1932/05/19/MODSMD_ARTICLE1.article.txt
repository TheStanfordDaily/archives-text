# POLOISTS RIDE TOWARD COAST PENNANT TODAY
## First Time Stanford Team Has Come To Finals On Pacific Coast CHAMPIONSHIP CALIBER Fleming's Injury May Mean Loss Of Game 
### Bill Myers 
Card polo fans will be watching
with crossed fingers when the Red
shirt riders take the field against
Oregon State this afternoon in the
first of a two-game series for the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Polo
Championship.
This will be the first time that
Stanford has advanced so far in the
world of polo. Devoted followers of
the Card team find it hard to be
lieve that the Farm has finally
turned out a team of championship
caliber. Years have passed, and al
though good average squads have
always been the rule, nothing as
brilliant as this season's outfit has
ever worn the crimson, jerseys.
Anything May Happen
In a game like today's, almost
anything can decide the outcome.
A broken mallet, a horse stumbling,
saddle equipment giving away, a
gust of wind, a tumble, or even a
tiny divot . . . any of these may
mean the loss or gain of a goal
which is likely to mean the game.
But the odds at. least will be even
in this matter of "breaks" except
on one vital point. That is Captain
Bruce Fleming, the "iron man" of
the Card defense. Fleming hasn't
completely recovered from a pulled
jockey muscle, and it depends en
tirely upon the Gods of Chance
whether he can last the whole game.
If all goes well, ihen the odds are
even for a Redshirt win.
Fleming Important
If Fleming's injured jockey muscle
■—the tendon that is used to grip
one's legs to the saddle—gives out,
then the hopes of the Farm for a
championship polo team may be
blasted utterly. Rufus Spalding, who
regularly plays at number two, and
is the only possibility for the de
fense position, will have to be shift
ed to Fleming's number four berth.
Spalding is being counted on to do
the bulk of the scoring and from
the back position this will be al
most impossible.
In the matter of mounts, the
Beavers and Cards are at a stand
f)fl. Oregon State has brought along
their own R.O.T.C. ponies, which
arc practically of the same caliber
as Stanford's horses.
Play starts at 4 o'clock on the
Highway field. Captain Robinet of
the San Francisco Presidio will
referee. The line-ups:
Stanford— Oregon State—
Gillham 1 Price
Spalding 2 O'Connor
Lewis • 3 Penney

Card polo fans will be watching
with crossed fingers when the Red
shirt riders take the field against
Oregon State this afternoon in the
first of a two-game series for the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Polo
Championship.
This will be the first time that
Stanford has advanced so far in the
world of polo. Devoted followers of
the Card team find it hard to be
lieve that the Farm has finally
turned out a team of championship
caliber. Years have passed, and al
though good average squads have
always been the rule, nothing as
brilliant as this season's outfit has
ever worn the crimson, jerseys.
Anything May Happen
In a game like today's, almost
anything can decide the outcome.
A broken mallet, a horse stumbling,
saddle equipment giving away, a
gust of wind, a tumble, or even a
tiny divot . . . any of these may
mean the loss or gain of a goal
which is likely to mean the game.
But the odds at. least will be even
in this matter of "breaks" except
on one vital point. That is Captain
Bruce Fleming, the "iron man" of
the Card defense. Fleming hasn't
completely recovered from a pulled
jockey muscle, and it depends en
tirely upon the Gods of Chance
whether he can last the whole game.
If all goes well, ihen the odds are
even for a Redshirt win.
Fleming Important
If Fleming's injured jockey muscle
■—the tendon that is used to grip
one's legs to the saddle—gives out,
then the hopes of the Farm for a
championship polo team may be
blasted utterly. Rufus Spalding, who
regularly plays at number two, and
is the only possibility for the de
fense position, will have to be shift
ed to Fleming's number four berth.
Spalding is being counted on to do
the bulk of the scoring and from
the back position this will be al
most impossible.
In the matter of mounts, the
Beavers and Cards are at a stand
f)fl. Oregon State has brought along
their own R.O.T.C. ponies, which
arc practically of the same caliber
as Stanford's horses.
Play starts at 4 o'clock on the
Highway field. Captain Robinet of
the San Francisco Presidio will
referee. The line-ups:
Stanford— Oregon State—
Gillham 1 Price
Spalding 2 O'Connor
Lewis • 3 Penney
Fleming 4 Dirker
Mclone, Sub. Bohannon, Sub.
