## 
### 
j John Van Druten, author of j
j "Young Woodley," to be read at to
| night's meeting of Sword and San- |
dais in the Little Theatre, is well !
acquainted with the life he portrays.
The play has aroused considerable
comment wherever produced.
It presents the problem of disci
plining adolescents in an English
boys' school and protests the lack of
j understanding displayed by the in
j structors. A housemaster, Simmons,
; represents the evils of the system.
It is a role which demands careful
playing. Leland Chapin, English in
structor, is to portray the severe
and soured schoolmaster.
Dorothy Tully will be his young
wife, who married to escape the
! solitude of intellect in a small town,
j is as misunderstood by her husband
>as are the students. Her role, like
jthat of Amytis, which she read in
j "The Road to Rome," demands an
| appreciation of nuance, change.
Four students, each skilfully dif
ferentiated, also need understanding
and intelligent interpretation.
I Woodley, a sensitive esthete; Ain
| gcr, his older, more experienced
friend; Vining, a coarse pseudo
! sophisticate; and Cope, a wretched
ly treated fag, will be read by James
Sandoe, Joseph Wolf, Edward Girzi,
and Robert Brauns, respectively.
The reading is to begin at 7:30
i o'clock as usual. Late-comers will
i not be seated.
