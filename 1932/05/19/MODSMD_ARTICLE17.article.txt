■ the confession of the Virginia boat
' builder, were bared by the Lind- 1
I bergh murder investigators tonight 1
las they made John Hughes Curtis
! the target of a criminal action and

| drama.
As the criminal action- against 1
I Curtis went forward police had at I
! least three pertinent questions about'
him to which they urgently desired j
satisfactory answers. They were:
Where was Curtis the night of i
j March 1, when the Lindbergh baby i
i was kidnaped?
Was the green sedan which he
urged investigators to hunt, his own ,
I car—the only one found that an- j
! swered the description he gave?

The chief of police in Curtis' home
. town, where one division of the in- i
j vestigation is centering, said he did
j not believe the shipbuilder had
I made a complete confession.
"I believe there is something
I more, something important he has
not yet told/' said the chief, S. W.
| Ironmonger.
Primarily the directing heads of
| the relentless pursuit wanted to
! know whether Curtis had told "the
' whole truth."

unconfirmed information that Cur
i tis' associate in his fake negotia

\ and made a futile request that Col
| onel Charles A. Lindbergh supply
i $25,000 for ransom purposes.
Police said the clergyman showed
j "no desire to co-operate with the
j authorities" and had indicated to
them he did not know whether he

HOPEWELL, N.J., May 18. (A 1 )—
! Hidden details, missing even in;
■ the confession of the Virginia boat
' builder, were bared by the Lind- 1
I bergh murder investigators tonight 1
las they made John Hughes Curtis
! the target of a criminal action and
i moved to investigate further the
'"Jafsie" phase of the fantastic!
| drama.
As the criminal action- against 1
I Curtis went forward police had at I
! least three pertinent questions about'
him to which they urgently desired j
satisfactory answers. They were:
Where was Curtis the night of i
j March 1, when the Lindbergh baby i
i was kidnaped?
Was the green sedan which he
urged investigators to hunt, his own ,
I car—the only one found that an- j
! swered the description he gave?
Was mud found on that sedan, |
' Jersey mud?
Hint Story Incomplete
The chief of police in Curtis' home
. town, where one division of the in- i
j vestigation is centering, said he did
j not believe the shipbuilder had
I made a complete confession.
"I believe there is something
I more, something important he has
not yet told/' said the chief, S. W.
| Ironmonger.
Primarily the directing heads of
| the relentless pursuit wanted to
! know whether Curtis had told "the
' whole truth."
Link Norfolk Cleric
They made public the hitherto
unconfirmed information that Cur
i tis' associate in his fake negotia
! tions, Dean H. Dobson-Peacock of
; Norfolk, Va., once expressed his
! confidence in the contacts of Curtis
\ and made a futile request that Col
| onel Charles A. Lindbergh supply
i $25,000 for ransom purposes.
Police said the clergyman showed
j "no desire to co-operate with the
j authorities" and had indicated to
them he did not know whether he
( could come here at all for ques
l tioning.
Consider Criminal Action
At Norfolk, however, Dean Dob-
I son-Peacock vigorously denied he
I had any knowledge of a request
I upon Colonel Lindbergh for money.
Colonel H. Normao Schwarzkopf
I said: "We cannot legally compel"
i Dean H. Dobson-Peacock to come
; I to New Jersey. In the same state
! ment Schwarzkopf said a question
jas to whether there might be any
i | grounds for criminal action in the
| Virginia Clergyman's alleged at

I Lindbergh post $25,000 was being
referred to the Attorney General of
