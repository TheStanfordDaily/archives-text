Ihe stage is sol. The i >il»' show is on.
Amidst the cheering of thousands of enthusiastic stu
dents, the few final candidates for minor class oflices cli
maxed an all-day signature hunt last night as they entered
their names on the ballots just before the polls closed at
s:.'{() o'clock.
On hall and in row, interest is at ;i fever heat. Groups
gathered about the campus discuss the chances of this man
or that lor the treasurcrship of the ( .lass of '31, or the secre
taryship of the Class of '33. Campus leaders are formulat
ing their policies for the coming school year, deciding the
destinies ot the classes they are to guide. Which shall it
be, pink or orange programs for the class dance?
Thus all is well. For, with excitement mounting, a tre
mendous turnout looms for next week's class elections,
elections which will put into otlice the men who will later
pose for large, individual pictures in the 1933 Quad.
Yes, ii may be true that the work now carried on for
each class by a president, a vice president, a secretary, and
!' treasurer could be handled easily by the president alone,
probably more efficiently. True also that the single class
head position would be more desirable, sought by well
known, more capable men, men whom the voters would be
able, at least, to connect with the names on the ballots.
Hut obviously those minor advantages are hardly worth
a thought when one considers the glory, the publicity, the
"success-at-college" careers that the present system of
multiple class offices affords to so many students.
