# LAGUNITA, MOSQUITO BREEDER
## 
### 
The dccline and fall of Lagunita is something that may
nol have presented itself lo the attention of the campus
as a whole, hut it is a subject that has been very unpleas
antly thrust upon the inhabitants of Roble, from which
stronghold protesting wails are now beginning to issue.
Wit!) the cessation of rainfall in the Searsville water
siied, the inflow of water to Stanford's aquatic playground
has been discontinued. As a result, the lake has shrunk to
a shadow of its former self, and the muddy residue lias be
come an ideal incubator for enterprising mosquitos, who
seek nourishment in the unfortunately adjacent hunting
grounds of the Rastille. An uncautiouslv opened window
subjects the occupants of the room to a vicious attack by
the omnipresent pests. The sun porch is reported to be un
safe for devotees of the ultra-violet even at midday.
Having now reached a stage at which it no longer at
tracts the leisured pleasure seekers who once disported
themselves upon its surface, Lagunita is no longer of use to
the inhabitants of the Farm. If it were drained no objec
tion would be raised by the students. Hut even if draining
is for any reason impracticable, il would seem that the wa
ters'of the lake could be rendered innocuous by the simple
process of coaling i! with oil.
A university which takes great care of the morals of its
feminine students should have some consideration for their
physical well-being. I! will be a blot upon the fair name of
Stanford if the cries of anguished Hobleites are permitted
to continue unheeded.
