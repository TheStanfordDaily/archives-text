(llass feeling is generally little more than a name on this
campus, there is no real reason to wish it otherwise, hut in
the case of a group about to graduate a certain amount of
fellowship seems not out of place.
Those who feel regret at leaving the Farm and its ac
tivities for the last lime should enjov a final taste of the
informal sociability that prevails here, and even those who
are glad to get out ot the preparatory stage of life will not
be averse to making merry with friends who will be scat
tered to the four winds in a few months.
The graduating class is a group especially suited to this
type of affair. After four years of residence here the mem
bers are sullieicntly well acquainted to avoid any atmo
sphere 1 of constraint, while at the same time many new
friendships which may carry over after graduation can be
formed.
With the amusements not confined to dancing, the party
should appeal to all tastes. A good turnout ought to reward
the originators of the plan.
