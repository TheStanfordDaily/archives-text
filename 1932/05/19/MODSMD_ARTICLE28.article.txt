# BULL SESSION
## WHO SAID JUNIOR OPERA? 
### 
A certain party in yesterday's ]
, Campus Opinion became over
| heated at the mere suggestion that |
j the Editor of the Daily presumed to;
hold :in opinion differing from his. 1
i Imagine Editor Sullivan's outrageous
j boldness—if you can. He dared to
criticize the Junior Opera—without
| first consulting the boiling Campus
Opinioner and his friends who en- ,
j joyed the performance.
I I did not appreciate that thing that
i went for an opera. But we do not;
j become enraged at someone who
j disagrees. Rather do we express j
l naive wonder, great surprise, and 1
! complete astonishment —but never
uncontrolled rage—at what seems >
to us as totally undiscriminating I
taste.
The '"Junior" part of the "Junior J
Opera" has long been a meaningless I
hangover. But this year the tradi- i
tion was carried on to more com- j
plete heights of mis-naming when j
the word "Opera" also ceased to '
have any evident significance. The j
audience was deliberately tricked.
They came to see an opera; and
they stayed to see a fragmentary
"Big Game Gaieties." The trick was
not complete, however. There was
a plot, born in the first act, com
pletely forgotten during most of the
I second, and hurriedly dragged in
land quickly disposed of in the last
' scene.
For a moment, a tie-in of the plot
during the detached second loomed.
That was when somebody slunk on j
i to the stage in an overcoat that»

| closely resembled—if it was not
j exactly identical—with one worn by
the villain in the first act. That was
; a false hope that was quickly dis
! pel led when we were treated to a
: slightly revamped Gaiety skit. If
the Dramatic Council wishes to pro
duce two "Gaieties" in the year,
well and better. But to tease the
l audience along for one act of what j
. looks like is to develop into an |
; opera, and then smash through with;
'a vaudeville finish, is cruel—border- j
ing on I lie inhuman.
There were some good spots in
j "Two's Company." Eph Engleman
; was most of them. When he left the
stage, things usually became hope-
I lessly dull. Eph did everything for
| the show but stand on his head and
j poke his eyes out for the amuse
| ment of the gallery. Mary Anita
i Loos was also an attraction. Her j
! legs were the best that have walked j
i across the stage in many and many j
a year. Shapely from ankle to j
. thigh, they created great enthusiasm j
I among the roughs. In fact, one might !
i say the show rested on Engleman's j
shoulders and Loos' legs.
Some may argue that any type of j
entertainment is O.K. on Junior
Opera night. To that, one may read
ily object. The Junior phase is
meaningless, by having the Opera
| written by sophomores, acted by
| seniors, for freshmen. The Opera
! phase will also be extinguished by
j injecting any skit that will, draw or
j may have the faint possibility of 1
| drawing a "hand."

A certain party in yesterday's ]
, Campus Opinion became over

j the Editor of the Daily presumed to;
hold :in opinion differing from his. 1
i Imagine Editor Sullivan's outrageous
j boldness—if you can. He dared to

Opinioner and his friends who en- ,
j joyed the performance.
I I did not appreciate that thing that
i went for an opera. But we do not;

uncontrolled rage—at what seems >
to us as totally undiscriminating I
taste.
The '"Junior" part of the "Junior J
Opera" has long been a meaningless I
hangover. But this year the tradi- i
tion was carried on to more com- j
plete heights of mis-naming when j
the word "Opera" also ceased to '
have any evident significance. The j
audience was deliberately tricked.
They came to see an opera; and
they stayed to see a fragmentary
"Big Game Gaieties." The trick was
not complete, however. There was
a plot, born in the first act, com
pletely forgotten during most of the
I second, and hurriedly dragged in
land quickly disposed of in the last
' scene.
For a moment, a tie-in of the plot
during the detached second loomed.
That was when somebody slunk on j
i to the stage in an overcoat that»

| closely resembled—if it was not
j exactly identical—with one worn by
the villain in the first act. That was
; a false hope that was quickly dis
! pel led when we were treated to a
: slightly revamped Gaiety skit. If
the Dramatic Council wishes to pro
duce two "Gaieties" in the year,
well and better. But to tease the
l audience along for one act of what j
. looks like is to develop into an |
; opera, and then smash through with;
'a vaudeville finish, is cruel—border- j
ing on I lie inhuman.
There were some good spots in
j "Two's Company." Eph Engleman
; was most of them. When he left the
stage, things usually became hope-
I lessly dull. Eph did everything for
| the show but stand on his head and
j poke his eyes out for the amuse
| ment of the gallery. Mary Anita
i Loos was also an attraction. Her j
! legs were the best that have walked j
i across the stage in many and many j
a year. Shapely from ankle to j
. thigh, they created great enthusiasm j
I among the roughs. In fact, one might !
