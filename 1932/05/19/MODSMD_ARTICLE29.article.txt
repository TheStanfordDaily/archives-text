SCANDAL FOR SALE — At the
Varsity Theatre.
Charles Bickford, Rose Hobart,
and Pat O'Brien are the leading
figures in this fast-moving drama
of the newspaper game; and it is an
ideal show for the person who like,?
his thrills fast and frequent.
In addition to the main plot, the
story offers a series of thrills out of
which many movies make a whole
film: a murder, an airplane flight,
a frame-up, and a trial scene.
Bickford is the sensation-seeking
managing editor, Rose Hobart is his
wife, and Pat O'Brien the star re
porter, a former suitor of his friend's
wife.
In his thirst for sensationalism,
Bickford neglects his home, and his
son dies. Then he sends O'Brien on
a transatlantic flight for news, and
his friend goes to his death.
Though the plot is obvious, it's

the kind of obviousness that you
don't realize until it's all over. The
film is utterly absorbing, with never
a let-up from start to finish. Its
greatest weakness is the introduc
tion of irrelevant details.
The three leading players handle
their roles well, with Bickford out
standing by reason of the largest
part. —E.C.
GREEN PASTURES—At the Col
umbia Theatre.
Here's to the most entertaining
show of the season from the stand
point of passive aesthetic interest.
It is appealingly simple, colorful,
and naive.
"Green Pastures" is the chrono
logical presentation of the Old Tes
tament wonders as they live for the
believers in the religion of the
American negro. The Bible stories
are adapted to the consistencies of

their everyday lives, and are taught |
j as such, to the children.
The most spectacular bits of the 1
play are made possible by the use !
of a lull stage treadmill on a float- j
| ing stage. The show is composed of |
j eighteen scenes, some of which are l
I set in a tangible three-dimensional j
j heaven with headquarters in the |
i Lawd's office; others take place on |
I the earth during many centuries of
| its development.
The Lawd is undoubtedly the hero
I of the play, and ". . . even the
j Lawd's job is no bed of roses." This j
I lofty character is masterfully played ;
I by Richard Harrison whose artistry j
j has been recognized and rewarded
j by the Springarn medal.
I For real enjoyment, see "Green
| Pastures" and go early in the en
| gagement because you will probably
| want to see it again. . —E.E.IT.

STREET SCENE—At the California
Theatre, Mayfield.
For real drama, "Street Scene" is I
hard to beat. In the stellar roles 1
the cast includes Sylvia Sydney, !
William Collier, Jr., and Estelle i
I Taylor, all of whom turn in good j
! performances. Sylvia particularly i
does her role well, turning in an- j
other big hit. The picture shows
what is meant by the sociologists j
when they condemn the existing ]
order of things. It makes you think.
If you missed it in Palo Alto, be !
sure and see it now. —W.B.
