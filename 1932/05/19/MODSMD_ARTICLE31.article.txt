The Editor, Sir:
Upon its first appearance in the
Daily, the brief summary of radio
programs offered under the title of
"Turn the Dial Toâ€”," seemed to be
r worthwhile addition to our cam
pus publication. However, it has
lately taken on the appearance of a
last week's newspaper radio pro
gram which is always lying around
when you want to find a good pro
gram to forestall studying. It seems
that an accurate list of radio fea
tures could be compiled with a com
paratively small expenditure of
time and energy. The idea of listing
features of the day is good, but do
it with the idea in mind of having
someone make use of it instead of
merely filling up space.
Sincerely submitted,
"Red" Cross
