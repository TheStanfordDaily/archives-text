# CARD AUTO SETS FIVE NEW MARKS
## World Records Beaten By Three To Ten M.P.H. 
### 
Five world's records set last Mon
day by the racing car developed by [
Professor E. G. Reid of the Cuggen- j
heim Aeronautics Laboratory and j
Ulysses A. Patchett, an instructor in !
mechanical engineering, bettered:
the existing records by 3 to 10 miles j
an hour, Professor Reid said yes- j
terday. 1
The new records are as follows:
1 kilometer, 148.218 m.p.h.; 1 mile,
147.356 m.p.h.; 5 kilometers, 133.918
m.p.h.; 5 miles, 133.285 m.p.m. The I
mile also broke the record for four- j
cylinder cars of unlimited displace- j
inent.
Driven by "Stubby" Stubblefield, |
Ihe car set the new records on Muroc
Dry Lake near Mohave. Stubblefield I
will pilot tht- car at the Indianapolis I
500-mile race May 20.
This is the first racing car in ■
America intended for use on curved
tracks which has ever been scien
tifically streamlined, Professor Reid ;
said. The principle distinction be
tween this and other racing cars is
the sacrifice of small frontal area
to smoothness of contour, and avoid
ance of any abrupt change of curva- I
ture. As a result air resistance is
materially reduced, he said. At the :
trials Monday the dust, instead of'
being sucked after the car as in i
ordinary racing cars, immediately;
settled to the ground, there being j
no churning of the air behind the,
car.
MADRID, May 18. (/P)—A motor i
transport strike started today
throughout Spain except in Cata- j
lonia, Navarre, and Basque pi*o- j
vinces. Garages, agencies, and ac- i
cessory shops also were closed.
Nick Harris, Los Angeles detec- '
live in the identification bureau,'
says hairs are split by a "micro
tone" for identification purposes.
