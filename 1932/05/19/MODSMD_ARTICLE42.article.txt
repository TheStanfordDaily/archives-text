# Card Chances Slim For Track Victory
## Stanford May Take Crown If Individual Performers Come Through With Expected Places 
### MAURICE RAPF 
TANFORD can't win the California Intercollegiates!
None too encou raging words i«» l'ced to a host of Stanford readers just
about 48 hours before this annual track-fcst gets under way at Berkeley
this Saturday; but the fact remains that U.S.C. must win; ami if U.S.C.
must win, Stanford cannot.

Giving Bill Ellington's men every
possible break in a pre-meet dope
.sheet, the outcome still has a de
cidedly Southern California aspect.
And it isn't because of U.C.L.A.,
either.
Stanford's claim to glory in the
meet will depend strictly upon the
individual performances turned in
by men wearing the Cardinal and
White colors, and if things turn out
as they did in the U.S.C. meet, a
large part of the audience may
leave Edwards Stadium singing the
praises of Stanford after all.
Track Holds Fans
Certainly the chief interest which
the meet will hold for the cash cus
tomers will be the competition in
the separate events. On the track,
the Wykoff-Kiesel clash in the hun
dred; the 2-mile race between Cal
lahan of U.S.C. and Stanford's
sophomore, Ollie Amdahl; the mile,
with a renewal of the rivalry be
tween Raftery, Ferrie, and Halstead,
of California, Stanford, and U.S.C.,
respectively; and, of course, the ap
pearance of Ben Eastman in the 440
and relay will be a full afternoon's
spectacle.
In addition, however, there will
be some outstanding duels in the
field events. The pole vault, with
Pool and Van Tress of California,
Johns, DeGroot, and Miller of Stan
ford, Jefferson of U.C.L.A., and
Graber and Chlentzos of U.S.C. all
capable of well over 13 feet, should
be something worth seeing. Again
there will be A1 Ray's attempt to
gain revenge on Frank Williamson
for that •''■B-inch defeat in the jave
lin at the U.S.C. meet.
Ha hies Belter
A bit of good news trickled forth
yesterday afternoon when it was
learned that the team's hard luck
captain, "Ike" Hables, didn't have
appendicitis after all. In fact, his
ailing side was so much improved
that he was released from the hos
pital. But the good news stopped
here, for he will not run on Satur
day.
Other items about the varsity's
injured contingent indicated that
neither Ralph Giberson nor Bill
Werder will compete. The elimina
tion of Giberson leaves Ellington
without a single sprinter, so that
no Stanford entrants will be listed
for either dash or for the high
jump on Saturday.
