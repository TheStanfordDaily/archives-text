THE ACTION OF THE Ex .
Committee Tuesday night may
not put the final bar across the
rifle team's fight for recognition,
but just in case the few who
engineered that clever bit of
work think the book is closed
we will offer a little of the fol
lowing information.
First of all, the rifle club is in no I
way connected with the military de- ■
partment at Stanford. The guns be- j
long to the club, the ammunition is!
paid for out of the club dues, and
the matches are conducted by the j
club. Without aid from anybody the
club has finished a most successful
season.
However, it is beyond the club's
power to give its members minor J
sports awards, without the help of i
the Ex Committee.
No one asked the committee
to make rifle-shooting a first- !
class minor sport. The club
members are willing to buy their i
own sweaters. All they desire is j

the sanction to put something on
tlicm—namely, a letter. So put
that amendment on the ballot
next Tuesday, and give the stu
dents a chance to indicate
whether or not they want rifle
shooting as a SECOND CLASS
| minor sport!
i As long as almost everybody is
j satisfied with the results of the
Fresno West Coast Relays, it is all
! right to cease yelling about the
high-jump.
But the city papers have ex
pressed a thought that deserves
consideration in asking for more
carefully picked officials. These big
track meets are usually run by very
j efficient men, but the questionable
I sportsmanship usually goes on
I around the curves, and it is there
! that the less-carefully selected of
! ficials are stationed.
The ordinary fan, unless lie

I another, or at least studied the
