# Japanese Nine To Face Card Baseball Team
## 
### Bob Wade 
With their game against the Los
Angeles Nippon team yesterday as
their one exhibition in Southern
California, the Rikkyo University
squad will arrive on the Farm early
tomorrow morning in preparation
l'or their final intercollegiate ap
pearance, against Stanford on the
Sunken Diamond, in the afternoon.
The Southern aggregation is one
of the best semi-pro outfits in the
state. Who will be Rikkyo's starting
pitcher here depends on how badly
they wanted to win the Southern
contest.
Good Pitchers
Rikkyo has two dependable hurl
ers in Tsuji and Kikutani. The for
mer is a fast-ball pitcher, and repu
tably the best in Japan, while the
latter depends on a puzzling curvc
ball to bring him victories.
In the infield the visitors will
probably have Captain Sekiguchi,
Yamashiro, Katanaka, and Uehida,
with Momose behind the plate. The
first-string outfielders are Naka
jima, Miura, and Kunitomo.
Momose, Yamashiro, Nakajimo
are listed as the best sluggers on
the squad, and from the reports of
the games played so far they
will probably cause the Indian
chuckers plenty of trouble before
the contest is over.
Superior Teamwork
They are just as interested in
playing good baseball, as in winning
games, and last autumn defeated all
the leading Japanese teams except
Waseda. All the newspaper critics
in the Land of the Rising Sun re
port that Rikkyo's victories are
largely the result of superior team
work.

j season.

clear conception of the rules.
And this probably accounts for
I the increasing number of moot
questions which conic out of the
big meets each year. And most
of them come out of the track
I events. —Bob Wade
