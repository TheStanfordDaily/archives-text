# FOUR LINKS STARS SHOOT ROUNDS IN SEMI-FINAL CLASH
## Last Year's Captain Versus 1932 Leader; Seaver Battles Brown 
### 
; With Harry Eichelberger playing
i Mai MacNaughton and Charlie Sca
j ver going the rounds with Gene
j Brown, the semi-finals of the Uni
i versity golf tournament will be run
| off on the local links this Saturday
| over a 36-hole route.
Last year's golf captain versus the
{ 1032 leader will be the unusual
| situation in the Eichelberger-Mac
i Naughton match, as the former
| captains this year's contingent of
i links stars, while Mai held the reins
j last season. But this isn't the only
attraction which this match should
| hold to an expected gallery of fans,
j for it brings together two of the
' best golfers that the campus has
| seen in recent years, golfers who
j can always be counted upon for de
pendable performances.
MacNaughton held down the
number one position on the varsity
all last year, but Bud was always
on his trail in second place on the
ladder. There were times when Bud
j could beat the man above him, but
I Saturday's encounter should tem-
I porarily settle this friendly feud, for
[ 1932 at least.
j Competition between Charlie Sea
] ver and Gene Brown goes back to
their days at Los Angeles High.
Seaver has been going like a house
on fire lately, inasmuch as he won
the Northern California amateur
i j championship at San Jose several
. ; weeks ago, his first match play
I tournament victory, however.
Brown was slow in rounding into
I form this season, but is just now
| beginning to shoot the high caliber
j of golf of which he is capable. He
j proved this in his match with War
ner Edmonds last week, when he
won one up on the eighteenth green.
The men will tee off at 9 o'clock
Saturday morning, and the public
| is invited as there will be no gal-
I lcrv fee.
