# European Shot Putters Rank as Olympic Threat
## 
### 
The "foreign menace" may cut its i
! path to a heavy majority of points
'in the 1!)!)2 Olympic Games shot
; putting if stories emanating from
j Europe and South Africa are re
| liable.
These reports, however, have
j been a little cloudy at times, and
i the ability of America's athletes—
principally Herman Brix and Har
low Rothert of the Los Angeles
j Athletic Club; Leo Sexton, New
; York A.C. star; Hugh Rhea of Min-
I nesota University, and Stanford's
Nellie Gray to come through may
I give Uncle Sam more than he ex
j pects.
Douba of Czechoslovakia was re
| ported to have done 54 feet, 4 inches
{ early this year, but subsequent
j verification proved his best effort to
j be 52 feet, 9 inches.
j Emil H irschfeld of Germany,
I probably the best-known of the
I foreigners, holds the recognized
I world's record at 52-7, and is said
! to be up to his form of last season.
| Hart of South Africa has tossed the
116-pound ball 52 feet,, 3 inches,
! which mark should be good enough
! for a third, at least, this summer
| in Los Angeles.
Darangi of Hungary, wilh a rec
ord of 51-11. and Wahlstedt of Fin
j land, who has done 50 feet, 7' •>
'inches, are other Europeans who
present good possibilities.
Far Eastern weight men have not
! approached any of the marks, so
far as can be determined. This is
! probably due to the smallness of

stature of the Chinese, Japanese
and Filipinos.
Both Harlow Rothert, formei
Stanford trackman, and Hermai
Brix have bettered 52 feet this year
Their experience should stand then
in good stead. Leo Sexton o
N.Y.A.C. did 52-7 in an indoor mee
this year, but, because indoor shot:
are covered with leather and an
consequently easier to handle, tha
mark cannot be relied upon toe
much.
Hugh Rhea of Minnesota did 51-'
in his third meet of the year anc
presents himself for serious con
sideration as a wearer of the Red
White, and Blue.
Nellie Gray of Stanford, alway:
improving, looks like a good "darl
horse." The California Intercolle
giates will probably be a good placc
to make up your mind on that.
