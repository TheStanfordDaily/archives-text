# Senate Downs 2.75 Beer Bill
## First Modification Attempt Defeated 3 To 1 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 18. (/P)—The j
Senate emphatically refused today
to legalize beer for revenue and
immediately afterward plunged into
the dispute over whether the tariffs
now in the billion-dollar tax bill
would be retained.
Amendments to the tax bill to
authorize beer of 2.75 alcoholic con
tent and of 4 per cent were over
whelmed by almost identical votes,
almost 3 to 1.
Tlie first beer tests in the Senate
since national prohibition showed |
the parties almost evenly divided I
on the issue. The roll call on 4 per i
cent beer was 60 to 23, and against
2.75 beer 61 to 24.
Crowded galleries and a filled \
chamber awaited the beer roll calls, j
A brief debate witli the gray-haired j
Sheppard of Texas, co-author of the |
eighteenth amendment, carrying the J
prohibition defense along against j
the attacking beer advocates, pi e- |
ceded the votes.
The issue was drawn on the pro- j
posal of Senator Tydings, Democrat, j
Maryland, to authorize beer of 2.75 j
per cent alcoholic content to help!
finance a $1,500,000,000 public con- j
struction bond issue.
