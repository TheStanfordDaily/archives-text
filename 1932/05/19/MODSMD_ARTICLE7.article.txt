A three-per-cent rebate on all
j sales tags turned in at the Book
store for winter and spring quarters, ;
iup to last night was announced
yesterday by Professor E. P. Lesley,
j president of the board of directors '
!of the Bookstore.
j The gross sales for the above
I period have been $44,924 and the
| rebates will amount to about $1350.
Payment will be made on or about
lJune 2.
Professor Lesley, in a rough es
timate, placed this year's total sales
j about $18,000 less than those fori
1931. Gross sales to date have been â€¢
I about $122,000 as compared to $140,- i
000 for a similar period last year.
It is because of this decrease in i
sales that the rebate percentage has
| dropped. A four-per-cent return
| was made for all quarter purchases,
'but in order to keep any floating
1 capital ;it all, it was necessary to
reduce the peicentage.
