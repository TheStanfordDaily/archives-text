# Senior Tickets Out On June 8
## Seats Given Only To Those Attending Exercises 
### 
"No tickets for baccalaureate and
commencement can be issued to
candidates for degrees who do not
expect to be present at the exer
cises," states Professor Edgar E.
Robinson, chairman of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises.
Students living on the campus or
in Palo Alto can receive their tick
ets only by calling at the Adminis
tration Building on June 8, although
other students may have theirs
mailed to them by sending stamped,
self-addressed envelopes to the
committee before May 30.
Letters have been sent to all can
didates and those desiring tickets
under the above ruling must return
the enclosed card to the committee
before May 30. Since no tickets can
be made available to those who do
not co-operate by complying with
the above conditions, Professor
Robinson urges that the candidates
for degrees who plan to be present
for either or both of the exercises,
will do as they arc requested so that
there will be no misunderstanding
later.
"If tickets were issued to all
candidates for degrees, of which
there are approximately 1200 this
year," says Professor Robinson,
"each student would receive but
one ticket. Consequently it seems
fairer to those who are planning to
participate in the exercises to re
serve tickets for their use only."
