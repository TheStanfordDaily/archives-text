### Bob Wade 
GAME TODAY
Stanford vs. Ilikkyo Univer
sity on the Sunken Diamond at
3:30 o'clock.

With their speed-ball pitcher j
saved for the game, and determined
to win the last contest on their tour j
of the United' States, the Rikkyo I
University squad will arrive on the
campus at 8:25 o'clock this morning. ;
Although little is known of the j
success of their trip, the visitors j
come highly recommended, and from i
the little news that has trickled in, I
it is safe to say that they will be j
able to give the Indians a very in- j
tcresting afternoon.
Best Pitcher in Japan
On the mound, the invaders will j
present Tsuji, the best pitcher in
Japan, and receiving his slants will
be Momose, one of the team's lead
ing sluggers. Yamashiro is slated to
get the call at the initial sack, with |
Katanaka at second, and Uchida at
the hot corner.
The short patch will be covered
by Captain Sekiguchi, backed up by
Miura in left field, Nakajima in
center, and Kunitomo in right.
The catcher, first-baseman, cen
ter-fielder, and left-fielder, arc the
sluggers of the team, but are said
to have a preference for curves. j
Livcrmorc Behind Plate
For Stanford, Stan Anderson is j
picked to start the game on the I
mound, with Ike Livermore behind j
ihe plate. Art. Hearn will probably I
hold down first base, with Vince j
Philippi on second, Trautman at
third, Delmas at short, and in the j
outfield Campbell, Captain Rintala, i
and Miles, in that order.
If the Indians have had time to
get over the little football that they j
might have picked up and get the ;
feel of the horsehide back in time, :
they should come off the victors, !
unless the invaders prove to be bet- j
tor hitters than previous teams from J
Japan.
Guests of B.A.C.
The Rikkyo squad will be guests |
of the B.A.C. at lunch in the Union, j
and of the Japanese Club for din- j
nor. Immediately after dinner they i
will leave for San Francisco where j
they are to be the guests of the San I
Francisco Seals baseball club, and j
Saturday they leave for home after j
two months in the United States.
The game here is scheduled to |
shirt, at 3:30 o'clock on the varsity j
diamond.
