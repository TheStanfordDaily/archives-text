# Three New Men To Enter State Intercollegiates
## George Grey Takes Laborde's Place in Shot Tomorrow; Sam Eastman to Run in 440 with Brother Ben; Ray Hundley to Join Relay Team 
### DICK STROUSE 
A PERUSAL of the roster of Indians who will journey over to Berkeley |
1 tomorrow to compete in the California Intercollegiates reveals two
well-known names that haven't appeared on a Stanford track list before 1
this year, and a third that is being officially entered for the first time.
George Grey, football star and second best shot-putter in last year's
1.C.4-A.'s, heads this group of "newcomers." Grey has been improving
rapidly the past two weeks, and will take Ilerc Lahordc's place in the
shot tomorrow. The scheme is to get Grey back into his llf.'M form so
that the Cards will earn four places in the 1!>:52 1.C.4-A.'s in July.
Sam Eastman, who is getting back®' -

into shape in surprisingly rapid
fashion, is scheduled to make the
trip and will run the 440 if he feels
strong enough. If Sam "chooses to
run" the Stanford entry in the
quarter will read "B. Eastman and
S. Eastman" as Paul Nash will be
kept out for the rela\.
Hundley in Relay
That relay quartet will find slim
1 young Roy Hundley running with
| Nash, Ben Eastman, and Fullcn
! wider. Hundley earned his position
iby beating Don Blackman, Dan
j Murphy, Sam Eastman, and Horace
I Guittard in Wednesday's trial, and
i he will be sporting a fancy red and
white sweat suit for the first time
j in his life Saturday.
i In addition to running the relay,
■ redoutable Ben Eastman will give
| the fans a treat by walking away
j with the 440. Or rather, Ben will
} run away with it, as he was told
; by Coach Bill Ellington last night
| to go out and crack the meet J'ec
!ol d of 47.4 which he set when he
| beat Vic Williams last year.
Box Ben? Huh!
Both Ellington and Eastman feel
that U.S.C. will try and box Ben
! again, and therefore they have hit
j upon the novel and ambitious £>lan
iof having Eastman avoid the box
by outrunning the field. Ben plans
|on keeping right on running after
i he has left hi.s opposition wonder
i ing why their sprint isn't as fast as
I his stride, until he has broken the
! tape to add another record to his
! growing total.
To offset the return of Grey and
j Eastman and 'he addition of Hund
, ley to the squad, the two Hables
Giberson, Lombardi, and Werder
will not be competing. The ailment::
of the first four of these men are
| well-known; Werder will not be
: entered because he is still in no
condition to broad-jump.
Don't Say "Sprinters"
With Les Hables, Giberson, and
' Lombardi out, the mention of the
word "sprinters" in the presence of
the coach or members of the Stan
ford track team brings forth scowl
ing rage or a questioning expression
of blankness. "Sprinters? Never
heard of such animals," they say,
, for even if every U. S. C., Califor
nia, and U. C. L. A. Dash-man were
jto break his blasted neck before
j Saturday's meet, Stanford still
• could not place a man simply be
| cause there is no Indian to place.
The situation in the high-jump is
i the same, as not a Cardinal athlete
i will be taken along to risk his neck
i flirting with six feet. In the broad
| jump, only Wally Butler will com
| pete, but if he continues to improve,
j the "only" will be enough.
Although the meet starts at 2
j o'clock, the hurdles will be run off
| at 11 o'clock in the morning. Thi«
1 will necessitate Meier's, Brugman's,
! and Herbert's leaving their beds
! earlier than their fellows to get to
| Berkeley in time to renew theii
i friendship with Payne, Welch, Bills
land Carls of U. S. C.

A PERUSAL of the roster of Indians who will journey over to Berkeley |

well-known names that haven't appeared on a Stanford track list before 1
this year, and a third that is being officially entered for the first time.
George Grey, football star and second best shot-putter in last year's
1.C.4-A.'s, heads this group of "newcomers." Grey has been improving
rapidly the past two weeks, and will take Ilerc Lahordc's place in the
shot tomorrow. The scheme is to get Grey back into his llf.'M form so
that the Cards will earn four places in the 1!>:52 1.C.4-A.'s in July.
Sam Eastman, who is getting back®' -

into shape in surprisingly rapid
fashion, is scheduled to make the
trip and will run the 440 if he feels
strong enough. If Sam "chooses to
run" the Stanford entry in the
quarter will read "B. Eastman and

Hundley in Relay
That relay quartet will find slim
1 young Roy Hundley running with
| Nash, Ben Eastman, and Fullcn
! wider. Hundley earned his position
iby beating Don Blackman, Dan
j Murphy, Sam Eastman, and Horace
I Guittard in Wednesday's trial, and
i he will be sporting a fancy red and
white sweat suit for the first time
j in his life Saturday.
i In addition to running the relay,
■ redoutable Ben Eastman will give

j with the 440. Or rather, Ben will
} run away with it, as he was told
; by Coach Bill Ellington last night
| to go out and crack the meet J'ec
!ol d of 47.4 which he set when he
| beat Vic Williams last year.
Box Ben? Huh!
Both Ellington and Eastman feel
that U.S.C. will try and box Ben
! again, and therefore they have hit
j upon the novel and ambitious £>lan
iof having Eastman avoid the box
by outrunning the field. Ben plans
|on keeping right on running after
i he has left hi.s opposition wonder
i ing why their sprint isn't as fast as
I his stride, until he has broken the
