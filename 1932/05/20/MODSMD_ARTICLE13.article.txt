# Brown Declares Chance Of Student Riot Remote
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
The possibility of a student riot at
Stanford is very remote, in the
opinion of Professor Harold Chap
man Brown of the philosophy dc
! partmcnt.
! "I can't imagine American stu
j dents rioting over politics as the
'university students do in Europe,
jsaid Dr. Brown yesterday. "There
is little evidence of a radical youth
! movement in America. The coming
] generation seems to be well satis
| fled with the social order."
Genial and popular, Dr. Brown
, has much interest in modern trends
i in education. He expressed great
I admiration for European scholar
ship.
"The superiority of the schools on
I the European continent is not due
! to any greater intelligence on the
I part of the students, but to the fact
J that they aren't taught things there,
| they learn—they are given a chance
1 t(» find out things for themselves,
i The idea is independent learning

rather than a professorial pouring i
forth of facts to bo memorized.
"The di 'nking and dueling at con- j
i tinental colleges, so much read i
| about, is confined largely to first
i year students. Each student works
| by himself; only the more insistent
ones get, degrees. We arc move |
i school-boyish in American colleges,,
but the opportunities for work arc
'just as good.
"It would not be a good thing to
j have independent study for all stu- ;
i dents at Stanford, because indc- j
I pendent study requires that a man j
I shall have learned how to find "lit
| things for himself and many uni
versity students have not done this. |
iThis is partially the result of i
: Am erican educational methods. Ele
mentary schools don't encourage
much individual curiosity.
"Orientation at college might best;
I be accomplished by several general]
! courses foi freshmen, in the social)
j sciences, physical sciences, biologi-i
I cal sciences, and literature.
