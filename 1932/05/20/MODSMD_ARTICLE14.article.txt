!
Hal Grayson and his orchestra arc
j on (ho campus; decorators arc rap- j
I idly completing transformation of
| the Women's Gym into an old Dutch !
I seaport; all but a few of the bids
] have been purchasedâ€”in short,
| everything is set for the hour of j
j nine tonight, when the Junior Prom i
I begins.
Making the trip from Los Angeles :
j by auto, the twelve musicians that :
| comprise the former Hollywood
j Roosevelt Hotel orchestra arrived j
last night, and immediately went in
! twosomes' to the various fraterni- i
I ties where they will spend the
! week-end.
Red Mill Built
Several houses, the committee re- j
I ports, dickered considerably for the j
j privilege of accommodating the
j pianist of the band, bidding for a
few strains of dinner music.
A huge, red mill stands at one [
end of the Women's Gym today, one i
side of which cannot % be distin-
I guished from an original row of |
I Dutch seaport store fronts, the other
| from a view of the sea.
Novel Lighting Effects
Lighting effects, now being in- J
stalled, will consist of several sub- 1
ducd color wheel spot lights, one of |
I which will play on the silver drop j
representing the sea, to reflect back
over the shadowy floor.
i Last night the A.S.S.U. office re- j
| ported that the number of bids sold |
i totaled well over the two hundred
I mark, and predicted early disposal j
I of the remaining few.
