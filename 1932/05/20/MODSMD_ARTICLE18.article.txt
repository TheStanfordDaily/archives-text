A chance of snaring on the
sly a picture of that girl is now
being offered to all members
of the 3000. A like opportunity
is afforded to campus women
to insure a photo of her secret
sorrow to be gloated over in
the privacy of the boudoir.
An extra supply of photo
glyphs of campus queens and
heroes now available at the
Quad office in the Press Build
ing is responsible for the in
flux of picture pasteboards
now fluttering about the cam
pus.
"This is an excellent chance
to store up next year's comic
valentine .supply," Quad offi

intimated that campus news
correspondents are dickering
for likenesses of the campus
big-shots.
The pictures are replicas of
those appearing in the '32
Quad and sell at 25 cents. The
Quad office is open every af
ternoon.
