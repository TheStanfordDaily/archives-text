## Daughter Reveals Phone Plea To Condon For Financial Help N.Y. TEACHER QUIZZED Go-Between Called Before Grand Jury 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., May 19. (/}')—
A possible link between a Brooklyn
school teacher and "Jafsie" bobbed
in and out of the Lindbergh murder
hunt today, as police exhibited
eagerness to learn more about the
activities of Dean H. Dobson-Pea
cock, associate of John Hughes
Curtis, hoax negotiator.
Behind the closed doors of the
Brooklyn District Attorney's office,
officials questioned Mrs. Mary G.
Ford for several hours about a re
port she had communicated several
weeks ago with Dr. John F. Condon,
who handled the $50,000 ransom
payment for Colonel Chariot# A.
Lindbergh.
Officers Quiz Daughter
In another room other officers in
terrogated the teacher's daughter,
Miss Gertrude Ford, whom they
found in a Riverside Drive apart
ment.
Both told substantially the same
story of their contact with the aged
"Jafsie," and later were released.
District Attorney W. F. X. Geo
ghan said he neither believed nor
disbelieved their explanation, but
would continue an investigation.
Mrs. Ford told her questioners a
story of being in financial straits,
thinking "Jafsie" might be able to
aid her. and appealing to him in
vain for $2500.
Officials Hint Clue
Information supplied by public
school officials started detectives off
on this new tangent. They heard
Mrs. Ford talk to Dr. Condon by
telephone, they said, and knew she
was absent from her duties between
February 25 through March 1, the
day of the kidnaping.
When they asked her about her
conversation with "Jafsie," they
told officials, she denied it was Dr.
Condon .she had spoken to said
it, was her daughter's physician.
Under questioning Mrs. Ford said
she first thought of Dr. Condon
when a private detective called on
her about another matter and start
ed discussing the Lindbergh case.
To Tell Story
Dr. Condon has a date to appear
before the Bronx county grand jury.
There he will tell the complete
story of his negotiations with the
gang that got the ransom—negotia
tions carried on by newspaper ad
vertisements, notes placed under
rocks, letters delivered by taxi
drivers, and such strange signals as
waving flags and raised window
shades.
Although State police said Dr.
Condon's daughter had told them
by telephone her father had been
advised by his physician to rest for
several days, "Jafsie" made the an
nounced trip to West Point during
the afternoon.
