# OUR FLOWERING FENCE
## 
### 
Stanford's garden chiefs added a striking item to the J
sunt total of eainj)us beauty when they planted brilliant i
Paul Scarlet roses along the new highway fence last year, j
Planned to cover up a three-mile stretch of rather unsightly
wire fencing, the roses are spreading and blossoming in a
way that promises to do more than merely conceal an eye
sore. Within two or three more years they will present a
solid mass of scarlet bloom to drivers passing the ('Diver
sity frontage on El (lamino Real.
The Farm already has a reputation as one of the most
attractive campi in the country, and this new feature gives
if another claim to fame. The extent and eye-filling quality
of the display makes it something not to be overlooked.
Virginia is widely known for its peculiar serpentine walls,;
but Stanford will have a rose fence that for beauty will far]
surpass the pride of the Cavaliers.
