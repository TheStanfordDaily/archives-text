# BULL SESSION

### 
Very clearly, the most awkward j
part of any "date" (the occasion and j
not the individual) is the "good- ;
night." The average co-ed here j
demonstrates phenomenal unorigin- 1
ality. This situation is not aided in
the least by the system now in j
vogue at Roble —the home of the (
"500" and at one time or another j
the "stamping ground" of the other
"3000." Five minutes before each j
deadline, we find couples standing j
around like pairs of bean poles—or, j
perhaps, sweet-pea sticks.
Just before the fatal minute-hand
sweeps on to the fatal half-hour j
mark, there is a movement among |
the bean poles. They surge toward |
the door—speak a few harmless
platitudes—and separate. Why is
this the case? First, if they have no
car, there is no place to sit down.
And there being no place to sit, the
only thing is to stand. Second, if
they have a car, there is always the
danger that the Roble clock may not
agree wit,h the timepiece of the
individuals concerned. And it seems
foolish to sit 90 feet from the door i
and get a lockout by one minute. j
There is another possibility-theo- j
retically. That is to separate imme
diately upon reaching the holy en- i
trance —regardless of the time. But ,
to push her through the door even !
so much as three minutes before- j
the deadline is taken as a clear in- l
dication of disgust and a hopeless j
evening. Therefore, the couple must
stand.
Intelligent conversation is impos
sible; the dominant theme is, "What |
is the time?" This mundane sub- j

GOODNIGHT AT ROBLE

ject always reduces tnlk to a very
low level. Personal conversation is j
apriori banned. The fellow stand- j
ing behind you—who every time,
he breathes deeply irritates your;
sunburned back—can hear every- i
thing- without even meaning to be j
a snooper.
There are several cures for this j
almost unbearable situation. First, j
a clock might grace the holy win- j
dows—so illuminated that it would i
be clearly visible to all the cars in j
the vicinity. Because there are so i
many divergent time-systems on j
the campus, it is impossible to as- j
sume or expect that the student's j
watch will check with the relentless j
hands of the lock-out clock.
A less-expensive system would bo j
merely to turn the bright arch light!
off and on several times at one or j
two minutes before the heavy doors I
to that sweet sanctuary of femi- j
ninity are closed and barred j
against all wayward sisters. A simi- |
lar system was once attempted and!
abandoned because people driving j
up at 3 a.m. didn't know if the j
light for 2:30 had already flashed, j
They would slay and wait, expect- j
ing the light to flicker and, because \
it failed to, would use that as an j
excuse for staying out all night.
I
The flashing light does not have |
to be an excuse for anybody. It i
should merely be an added con- !
venience for those who desire to j
use it. The present system of lock- !
ing the door at certain hours can J
go on independently.

mark, there is a movement among |
the bean poles. They surge toward |
the door—speak a few harmless
platitudes—and separate. Why is
this the case? First, if they have no
car, there is no place to sit down.
And there being no place to sit, the
only thing is to stand. Second, if
they have a car, there is always the
danger that the Roble clock may not
agree wit,h the timepiece of the
individuals concerned. And it seems
foolish to sit 90 feet from the door i
and get a lockout by one minute. j
There is another possibility-theo- j
retically. That is to separate imme
diately upon reaching the holy en- i
trance —regardless of the time. But ,

the deadline is taken as a clear in- l
dication of disgust and a hopeless j
evening. Therefore, the couple must
stand.
Intelligent conversation is impos

GOODNIGHT AT ROBLE

ject always reduces tnlk to a very

apriori banned. The fellow stand- j
ing behind you—who every time,

a snooper.
There are several cures for this j
almost unbearable situation. First, j
a clock might grace the holy win- j
dows—so illuminated that it would i
be clearly visible to all the cars in j
the vicinity. Because there are so i
many divergent time-systems on j
the campus, it is impossible to as- j
sume or expect that the student's j
watch will check with the relentless j
hands of the lock-out clock.

two minutes before the heavy doors I

abandoned because people driving j
up at 3 a.m. didn't know if the j
light for 2:30 had already flashed, j

it failed to, would use that as an j
excuse for staying out all night.
