# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now that the color of Stan's flan-
J nels has been sufficiently discussed,
; and everything has ended amicably,
, we would like to reply to an edi
! torial printed in the women's edi
; tion Monday which we think was
j not only false in its reasoning but
| possibly detrimental in its effects ,
; with regard to a most serious prob
! lem which is now facing Stanford's ,
I women.
That editorial was about the ac
! tion of A.W.S. Conference in con
| sidering the advisability of women
' hashing in soi'ority houses, and pre- I
sented a number of supposed argu
-1 ments against allowing them to do
' so.
Now, first of all, the college
' careers of many Row women are at |
! stake financially. There is hardly
j one of us who is not wondering
! rather apprehensively about where j
' that $114 is going to come from, and
i this is no disgrace; it is a puzzling j
j reality.
The four arguments advanced by
i the editorial were that aesthetically 1
i men hashers were better, that they |
[ were chosen for their brains, activi- j
| ties, and campus prominence, and i
i by hashing in the houses many sue- '
j cessful campus romances were made |
possible; that a student house man- ,
ager could wield no effective blud- j
geon over sister hashers; and that |
the dignity and poise of the present
regime would go if it were neces
! sary to peddle campus gossip to
| coffee-slinging sisters.
Now, from the aesthetic view
point, we admit that there have
i been in the past a few exceptional
j "stunning hashers" whose white
i jacketed elegance has graced Row
I dining-rooms. But we contend that
! the average female hasher, neatly
j clothed in her fresh, green smock,
I is above the average male hasher in
this respect. We feel that when the
college careers of many outstanding
Row women are in question, argu
ments on aesthetics should go by
the board.
And then comes that old standby,
the "hasher-sorority girl" romance.
We do not deny its beneficial effects,
but we do venture to point out its
rarity, which makes it, like all ex
ceptions, conspicuous. We do not
feel that the average male is in
clined to fall in love with a girl to
whom he must hand a dish of pota
toes each and every meal. And we
know that no house has such un
( attractive members that, in order
| to bring about successful matri
| monial adventures, it is reduced to
the necessity of luring men within
its walls with the bait of a hasher's
salary.
Next, the editorial stated that

house-managers and house-mothers
would find il difficult to maintain
discipline over sorority women
hashers. The only bludgeon the
present house-manager has over
men hashers, which she would not
have over sister hashers, is the
threat of loss of a job. We grant
that a house-manager would find it
difficult to fire a needy sister. Bui
we contend that there are better
ways of getting good service than
by threats of firing—any manager
of any store will tell you that. There

I are such things as suggestions,
, friendly reprimands, and tactful
! hints, and we state that it would
! be easier for a house-manager to
j improve the dining-room service in
! this way if she Were working with
i girls whom she knew.
And now remains the argument '
'that the "dignity and poise" of the
! present regime would be lost if it
[ were necessary to whisper campus
j gossip to a coffee-slinging sister.
Now it is just here that we feel
I that the editorial's argument is j
! weakest, for everyone knows that j
j gossip, far from being aided, is bin- j
; dered by the presence of men hash- i
! ers. Men hashers are apt to hear a ;
1 great deal of table conversation, and j
| they are seldom discreet in keeping j
i it to themselves. However, we our
; selves do not advance this argu
' ment, obviously favorable to our
! side, for we feel that the Row would
be a great deal better off with less
: gossip. j
As for the dignity and poise of ]
| the present regime, it seems to us ,
'that the dignity exercised toward j
i hashers, male and female, is only j
! another form of the dignity a sor
; ority woman should exercise to
| ward house-mother, guests, and
; members.
Remember that the houses are .
! going to be the first to lose it they
{ do not help their members to meet
j their financial difficulties. Roble in
\ the past has offered more oppor
; tunities to the self-supporting or j
i partially supporting students, and i
! because of the widespread prosper- ;
! ity, the Row has not suffered. But j
| those days have gone—temporarily, I
| at least, and the houses, in order to j
I keep fine, worthwhile girls on the :
I Row should leave all prejudices be- j

The Editor, Sir:
Now that the color of Stan's flan-
J nels has been sufficiently discussed,
; and everything has ended amicably,
, we would like to reply to an edi
! torial printed in the women's edi
; tion Monday which we think was
j not only false in its reasoning but
| possibly detrimental in its effects ,
; with regard to a most serious prob
! lem which is now facing Stanford's ,
I women.
That editorial was about the ac
! tion of A.W.S. Conference in con
| sidering the advisability of women
' hashing in soi'ority houses, and pre- I
sented a number of supposed argu
-1 ments against allowing them to do
' so.
Now, first of all, the college
' careers of many Row women are at |
! stake financially. There is hardly
j one of us who is not wondering
! rather apprehensively about where j
' that $114 is going to come from, and
i this is no disgrace; it is a puzzling j
j reality.
The four arguments advanced by
i the editorial were that aesthetically 1
i men hashers were better, that they |
[ were chosen for their brains, activi- j
| ties, and campus prominence, and i
i by hashing in the houses many sue- '
j cessful campus romances were made |
possible; that a student house man- ,
ager could wield no effective blud- j
geon over sister hashers; and that |
the dignity and poise of the present
regime would go if it were neces
! sary to peddle campus gossip to
| coffee-slinging sisters.
Now, from the aesthetic view
point, we admit that there have
i been in the past a few exceptional
j "stunning hashers" whose white
i jacketed elegance has graced Row
I dining-rooms. But we contend that
! the average female hasher, neatly
j clothed in her fresh, green smock,
I is above the average male hasher in
this respect. We feel that when the
college careers of many outstanding
Row women are in question, argu
ments on aesthetics should go by
the board.
And then comes that old standby,
the "hasher-sorority girl" romance.
We do not deny its beneficial effects,
but we do venture to point out its
rarity, which makes it, like all ex
ceptions, conspicuous. We do not
feel that the average male is in
clined to fall in love with a girl to
whom he must hand a dish of pota
toes each and every meal. And we
know that no house has such un
( attractive members that, in order
| to bring about successful matri
| monial adventures, it is reduced to
the necessity of luring men within
its walls with the bait of a hasher's
salary.
Next, the editorial stated that

house-managers and house-mothers
would find il difficult to maintain
discipline over sorority women
hashers. The only bludgeon the
present house-manager has over
men hashers, which she would not
have over sister hashers, is the
threat of loss of a job. We grant
that a house-manager would find it
difficult to fire a needy sister. Bui
we contend that there are better
ways of getting good service than
by threats of firing—any manager
of any store will tell you that. There

I are such things as suggestions,
, friendly reprimands, and tactful
! hints, and we state that it would
! be easier for a house-manager to
j improve the dining-room service in
! this way if she Were working with
i girls whom she knew.
And now remains the argument '
'that the "dignity and poise" of the
! present regime would be lost if it
[ were necessary to whisper campus
j gossip to a coffee-slinging sister.
Now it is just here that we feel
I that the editorial's argument is j
! weakest, for everyone knows that j
j gossip, far from being aided, is bin- j
; dered by the presence of men hash- i
! ers. Men hashers are apt to hear a ;
1 great deal of table conversation, and j
| they are seldom discreet in keeping j
i it to themselves. However, we our
; selves do not advance this argu
' ment, obviously favorable to our

that a house-manager would find it
difficult to fire a needy sister. Bui
we contend that there are better
ways of getting good service than
by threats of firing—any manager
of any store will tell you that. There

The Editor, Sir:
Now that the color of Stan's flan-
J nels has been sufficiently discussed,
; and everything has ended amicably,
, we would like to reply to an edi
! torial printed in the women's edi
; tion Monday which we think was
j not only false in its reasoning but
| possibly detrimental in its effects ,
; with regard to a most serious prob
! lem which is now facing Stanford's ,
I women.
That editorial was about the ac
! tion of A.W.S. Conference in con
| sidering the advisability of women
' hashing in soi'ority houses, and pre- I
sented a number of supposed argu
-1 ments against allowing them to do
' so.
Now, first of all, the college
' careers of many Row women are at |
! stake financially. There is hardly
j one of us who is not wondering
! rather apprehensively about where j
' that $114 is going to come from, and
i this is no disgrace; it is a puzzling j
j reality.
The four arguments advanced by
i the editorial were that aesthetically 1
i men hashers were better, that they |
[ were chosen for their brains, activi- j
| ties, and campus prominence, and i
i by hashing in the houses many sue- '
j cessful campus romances were made |
possible; that a student house man- ,
ager could wield no effective blud- j
geon over sister hashers; and that |
the dignity and poise of the present
regime would go if it were neces
! sary to peddle campus gossip to
| coffee-slinging sisters.
Now, from the aesthetic view
point, we admit that there have
i been in the past a few exceptional
j "stunning hashers" whose white
i jacketed elegance has graced Row
I dining-rooms. But we contend that
! the average female hasher, neatly
j clothed in her fresh, green smock,
I is above the average male hasher in
this respect. We feel that when the
college careers of many outstanding
Row women are in question, argu
ments on aesthetics should go by
the board.
And then comes that old standby,
the "hasher-sorority girl" romance.
We do not deny its beneficial effects,
but we do venture to point out its
rarity, which makes it, like all ex
ceptions, conspicuous. We do not
feel that the average male is in
clined to fall in love with a girl to
whom he must hand a dish of pota
toes each and every meal. And we
know that no house has such un
( attractive members that, in order
| to bring about successful matri
| monial adventures, it is reduced to
the necessity of luring men within
its walls with the bait of a hasher's
salary.
Next, the editorial stated that

house-managers and house-mothers
would find il difficult to maintain
discipline over sorority women
hashers. The only bludgeon the
present house-manager has over
men hashers, which she would not
have over sister hashers, is the
threat of loss of a job. We grant
that a house-manager would find it
difficult to fire a needy sister. Bui
we contend that there are better
