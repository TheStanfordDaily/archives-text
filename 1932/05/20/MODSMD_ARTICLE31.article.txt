rHE BASEBALL GAME with the
iitors from Rikkyo ought to be a
od exhibition, it' all the eompli
;ntary things that have been said
out them are true. They are said
be a great team in a sporting as
11 as in a playing way. This
>uld be some relief to those who
■asionally get tired of having end
s arguments with every ball
mo.
\fter having Captain Rintala of
• to bet us a quarter that they
iuldn't bunt once, we will refrain
im going into any more ecstasies
er the way the visitors will prob
ly bunt their way to fame and
tune. Anyhow they will un
ubtedly j)ut up a good game!
If you ever want a line on how
xi run publicity "as she is run"
list watch the way U.S.C. hands
nit the Wykoff yarns. You never
mow from one day to the next
ivheiher he is dead or just in a
•oma. And then, comes the day
if the meet, and little Frankie
.mashes the tape and climbs
nto his suit while the rest of
he boys are finishing,
loy Cuinmings, the Call-Bulletin's
>rts writer, has been trying for
•ee months to wise the S.C. pow
. up to the fact that they are
ting their own throats by their
nner of handling the case. But
far they have paid absolutely no
ention to him. Maybe they will
ke up to how publicity OUGHT
be run after the Olympic Games
• over. It is too bad that they
I't close the gate before the old
ty mare gets out.

Vnother thing that makes MR.
BLIC sit up and wonder thoughts
t good publicity men hate to
/e him wonder is an announce
nt like the following:
"Fred Deßerry will not be
'ery heavily favored to take
loLnts away from the Stanford
liiartet and Bob Hall, since he
ias had to take the tape off his
mgers!!!"
Maybe that was a misprint,
ut a few mistakes like that and
he stadium owners will be pay
tig the mourners. We can recall
situation like that in the
.C.4-A.'s last summer when one
f Nellie Gray's competitors
aised such a howl over a bit
f tape on a cut on one finger
hat the officials made Gray re
love the offensive tape. The
hot-put was subsequently won
t a mark much inferior to
iray's best mark.
!aptain George Pool, of Califor
, may be the world's greatest
ipetitive pole-vaulter, but we
e never yet seen him make a
d jump that he didn't heave the
back on when he started down,
/be he just accidentally runs into
nit we like to see the boys miss
bar completely. That's a real
ip!
And speaking of California
erformcrs, you have to hand it
i this Raftery boy. He jogs
iree-quarters of a mile, and
ten sprints the last lap. It
isn't won him all his races, but
has done fairly well.
nd just to give the California
rcollegiates a Stanford flavor,
ch Bill Miller and Here Laborde.
y are going to give the fans
ity to think about tomorrow.
