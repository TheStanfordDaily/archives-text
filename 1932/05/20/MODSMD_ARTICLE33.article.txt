# Stanford Poloists Swamp Oregon State, 7 To 1
## INDIANS CAPTURE FIRST BATTLE OF COAST POLO RAGE Oregon State Team Prove Hard Riding Outfit In Fast Match 
### Bill Myers 
Completely outclassing the Ore
gon State poloists in stick work and
team play, the Card riders captured
the first leg on the Coast cham
pionship here yesterday afternoon,
7-1.
The Redshirts were in peak form.
A few goal shots went wild, but this
was more than made up for by
crack teamwork.
Hard Riders
The Beavers were a hard-riding
outfit but missed a lot of set-up
shots. There was a woeful lack of
team piay. In the last two chukkers
the Northern riders began to click
a little better and finally managed
to poke through a goal in the clos
ing minutes of the game.
Although in yesterday's match
the Farm poloists played a vastly
superior game, Stanford has no
cinch for the Coast pennant. Tomor
row's game must also be won to
gain a clear title to the crown, and
there's quite a chance for an upset.
Poor Hitters
If Oregon State shows the same
brand of stickwork and team play
that they did in the last chukker
yesterday the Redshirts will have to
do a little hustling to keep on the
heavy end of the score. The Beavers
handle their ponies well but could
stand much improvement in ' the
matter of hitting the ball.
5 For Lewis
Peter Lewis playing at number
three snagged five of the Cards'
seven goals. Rufus Spalding, ordi
narily Stanford's big scoring threat,
managed to grab only one tally for
himself.
The final game in the series will
be played tomorrow at two o'clock
on the highway field. The lineup:
Stanford— Oregon State—
Gillham 1 Price
1 Spalding 2 O'Connor 1
5 Lewis 3 Penney
1 Fleming 4 Dirker
