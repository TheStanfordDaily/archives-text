Island leapers should maintain!
their superiority over mainland hop- :
ping champions in the classical
laroad-jump event to be contested
at the Olympic Games this summer.
Simeon Toribio of the Philippines is
an even money bet to win the run- I
ning high-jump, Mikio Oda should |
garner a Japanese victory in the j
liop-step-and-jump, and Nambu, j
world record holder at 26 feet, 2
inches, is favored to register an-1
other Japanese victory in the run- I
ning broad-jump.
Mikio Oda, besides his hop-step
and-jump and the high-jump activi- |
ties, will also be a strong contender
in the broad-jump. He has done 24
feet, 11 inches.
Silvio Cator, national hero of the
small island of Haiti, is the only

man besides Nambu to have jumped
over 26 feet. Cator held the world's
record until the Japanese jumper
came along. Both of these world's
champions finished behind Ed
Hamm, the American champion, in
the broad-jump at Amsterdam, but
the latter has retired from active
competition.
Germany's champion, Kockerman,
has done 24 feet, 11 inches, while
Sikorski added some 40 inches to
the Polish national record in jump
ing 24 feet, 8 inches.
