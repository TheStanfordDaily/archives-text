Omega on Greys' football field

With two men out, a man on sec- I
ond, the score tied, and with the j
game in the last half of the ninth ;
inning, Marv Miller of A.T.O. clout- I
ed a hard two-base hit to left field j
to bring in the winning run and to j
give Alpha Tau Omega the closest j
and greatest triumph of the intra- j
mural season with the Row's 8-7
victory over Sequoia II in yester
day's semi-final indoor champion
ship game.
Battling before the biggest crowd
yet to witness a mural fracas, the
two soft ball clubs clashed in a
deadlocked, 7-7 score game from the
beginning of the sixth frame until
| the last of the ninth.
Arhuckle Retires Two
i The men from the Hall nearly
( won the day in the seventh when
Vogt got on third and Gage on sec
ond. Backed by one out, Pitcher
Arbuckle of A.T.O. tightened up and
retired the next two men.
The game, the first to extend past
I the seventh frame, looked as if it
I might continue indefinitely. Hurlers ;
J Geddes and Arbuckle made each
j pitch count to allow only five scat
tered hits between the two of them
i for the last three innings.
Sequoia Opens in First
Sequoia opened up in the first in- j
l ning with Miller pitching for A.T.O.
to garner four runs from four hits.
The Hall men added another run in
the third. Not until the last half of
that inning did the men from up
the Row enter the run-scoring busi- ;
ness. In the last of the third the i
, A.T.O.'s tallied three runs. Both
teams filled up their quotas of seven
runs by the end of the sixth.
Miller claimed batting honors for
the day with his final two-bagger
and three other hits for five times
at bat.
