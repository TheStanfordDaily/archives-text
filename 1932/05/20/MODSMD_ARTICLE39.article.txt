# University Golf Tourney Reaches Semi-Final Round
## 
### MAURICE RAPF 
Old Man Par puts his back up j
against the wall tomorrow to brace
himself against the attack of the
four semi-finalists in the University
golf tournament who tee off at 9
o'clock in the morning to battle
over a 36-hole route.
It will be Harry Eichelberger
against Malcolm MacNaughton and
Charlie Seaver versus Gene Brown
on the Stanford course tomorrow.
Fortunately for the fans who would
like to see both matches, the two
somes will remain but one hole
apart.
The MacNaughton - Eichelberger
encounter brings last year's cap
tain in competition with the leader
of the 1932 golf squad. MacNaugh
ton was on the top of the ladder
last year, with Bud right, behind
him, but due to his lack of practice
this year, Mai may not be able to
cope with Eichelberger, who has
been playing a much-improved
brand of golf in the last few weeks.

MacNaughton, after scoring a 78
in the qualifying round, defeated
Andrews, Dwyer, and Trautman to'
advance to the semi-finals. He
looked particularly good in his win
over Jerry Trautman, all of which
leaves the outcome of tomorrow's
match pretty much up in the air.
Seaver-Brown
In his match against Dick Iloag
last Week, Eichelberger won on the
fourteenth, and then continued the
round to shoot a par 71, making five
birdies along the way.
Seaver, by virtue of his recent
success in tournament play, is a
heavy favorite to defeat Gene
Brown. Having already disposed of
Teague, Coffon, and Edwards by
large margins, the Northern Cali
fornia champion should have little
difficulty with his fast-improving
teammate.
