THE CROWD ROARS—At the
Stanford Theatre.
A racing picture which is full of
: thrills as long as the racing lasts,
beyond that, merely another weak
plot much in vogue of late. Daring
hero runs amuck of his own trade,
! fears driving again—turns bum.
James Cagney is James Cagney.
, It becomes increasingly hard to say
j any more about him. But his best
1 girl, Ann Dvoi'ak, has possibilities.
' She may get ahead. Joan Blondell
| comes in for her share of the roars.
! She's playing another tough and
• rough part, and playing it well. So
it's not a total loss.
Zasu Pitts makes the short of the
evening a hit, with several real
laughs, along with Flip the Frog
and regular news reel. —V.T.
