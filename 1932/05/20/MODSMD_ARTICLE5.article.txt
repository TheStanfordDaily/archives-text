# Audience Likes Young Woodley
## Chapin, Tully Take Honors In Dramatic Reading 
### 
After the decided success of
Sword and Sandals' readings of
'"Private Lives," "Road to Rome,
and last night John Van Druten's
"Young Woodley," it will be sur
prising if the Dramatic Council
doesn't take the cue and abandon
its policy of absolute purity.
Certainly the striving, on the part
of the Council, to avoid anything
verging on sex has decidedly limited
the plays available for production,
and may account for the current
dissatisfaction with the choices.
Exaggerated Story
"Young Woodley" concerns itself
with the problems of the adolescent
in an English boys' school. A read
ing of the play probably demon
strates better than a full produc
tion that there is a good deal of
exaggeration in the story but that
the point of the play is given sin
cerely. As a whole, last night's read
ing showed a great deal of careful
rehearsal which necessarily resulted
in decided smoothness of presenta
tion.
The fact that the play started on
time, and that the late-comers were
not admitted until the first inter
mission added to everyone's enjoy
ment. That the large audience pres
ent thoroughly appreciated Sword
and Sandals' latest effort in every
way was evidenced by the large
hand at every curtain.
Chapin Good
First honors for last night's read
ing goes to Leland Chapin for hi.s
interpretation of Simmon, the
schoolmaster. James Sandoe, who
read the part of Woodley, started
out rather weakly, but soon over
came his apparent self-consciousness
and was excellent during the rest
of the play, his work in the second
act being especially good. Dorothy
Tully, the only woman in the cast,
as Mrs. Simmon, repeated her suc
cess of the "Road to Rome."
