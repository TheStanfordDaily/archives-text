Increasing interest in vocational

stall a special section or shelf in
the Stanford Lnbrary of novels and
biographies containing material il
lustrating activities of various voca
tions.
Edna Barker, psychology major,
with the aid of Miss Hayes, refer
ence librarian, and C. Gilbert
Wrenn, vocational guidance secre
tary, is compiling a tentative list of
books for the section.
