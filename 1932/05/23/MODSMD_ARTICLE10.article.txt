At no time of the year is Stanford University more delightful
than during the summer months. With due respects to the climatic
attractions prevailing through the autumn, winter, and spring
quarters, it is my firm belief that the best weather occurs in the
summer quarter. This remark has been made to me often by under
graduates who have stayed on the Farm through the complete
academic year. And

there is no reason to
believe that living con
ditions will not be fine
this year.
To me, it is surpris
ing why relatively so
few undergraduates
take advantage of the
unusual opportunities
afforded by being in
residence for the sum
mer quarter. Older
students, as well as
those hard - pressed to
complete their courses
for financial reasons
can save time thereby.
In many cases, this
means the completion
of requirements for
the Bachelor's degree,
which would otherwise
be impossible. 'Always,
it means three months'

start in getting a po
sition, which may mean a great deal in avoiding the competition
of the thousands of college students applying for work simul
taneously.
Residence at Stanford University for the summer gives the
student unrivaled opportunity to work and play. At Stanford Uni
versity, unlike most other educational institutions, summer quar
ter is an integral part of the academic year. Courses are of a solid
character and taken for academic credit. The standards do not
vary a whit from those with which you are already familiar. As
a matter of experience, the undergraduate student usually makes
his best grades during the summer since his social life is distin
guished by a freedom from the unceasing distractions of the other
quarters. There is the chance to study under members of the
regular faculty augmented by distinguished scholars from other
sections of the United States and abroad. To those students who
believe that they can profit most by smaller groups where they
have a closer contact with their teacher, the summer quarter here
cannot fail to make a direct appeal.
The program this summer is exceedingly interesting. In addi
tion to an array of courses which should appeal to undergraduates
and graduates alike, there will be more academic and other visitors
on the Campus than in any previous summer quarter. The Olympic
Games will make California a mecca this summer. The greatest
interest is attached to the Olympic Try outs to be held on the
Campus on July 15 and 16, when the country's greatest track ath
letes will vie with our stars for the privilege of wearing the Red,
White, and Blue emblem. The I.C.A.A.A.A. meet at Berkeley is
another strong attraction. Lovers of music can enjoy for a small
fee the Summer Concerts at Hillsborough, while on the Campus
the special musical entertainments and the series of twelve lec
tures by Mr. Olin Downes of the New York Times are added
treats. All in all, the undergraduate student who habitually passes
by the summer quarter without realizing its enjoyments might
discover here the answer as to what he should do four weeks hence.
