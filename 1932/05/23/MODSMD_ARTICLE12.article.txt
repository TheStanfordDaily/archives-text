# WALTER WILL SPEAK HERE TOMORROW ON RUSSIAN SITUATION
## 
### 
"I wasn't a red, but I was very
pink."
That's how Ellery Walter, who
will lecture here tomorrow night,
describes his attitude toward Rus
sia when he began a four-month
tour of the Soviet country.
Walter went to Russia represent
ing the New York Tribune. He was
not satisfied with conditions in
America and expected, because of
the great progress that the Soviets
were reported as making, that they
might be able to help this country
on the road to progress.
Having worked his way around
the world and having spent four
months in Russia last summer, he
came back convinced that they did
not have as much to offer us as
their enthusiastic supporters have
led us to believe. He learned enough
Russian to enable him to travel
without an interpreter 15,000 miles
as far as Siberia and out by way
of the Black Sea.
Walter has lectured and debated
before a great many audiences in
the last few months. He is also the
author of "The World on One Leg"
and "High Hats and Low Brows,"
and his most recent book, "Russia's
Decisive Year," will be published
this spring.
