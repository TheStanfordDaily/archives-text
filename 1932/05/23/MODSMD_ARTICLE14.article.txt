## 
### Paul Zulch 
Stanford's annual crop of new
students is becoming more sophisti
cated every year.
The neophytes are serenely un
troubled by questions of religion,
sex, clothing, the moral tone of bull
sessions, and that favorite theme for
long-winded discourses in Campus
Opinion and the editorial column,
the Honor Code.
These conclusions were reached
after the tabulation of results of a
questionnaire mailed to 400 fresh
men and 250 junior transfers who
entered Stanford last fall. The in
vestigation was conducted by the
vocational guidance service of the
University with the aid of students
in the psychology department.
Asked their reaction to 20 specific
problems, none of the entering un

| dergraduates were bothered by the
! Honor Code, about one per cen !
i found the unequal ratio of sexes s
problem, less than one per cent dis
liked the moral tone of college bull
sessions, and none were troubled bj
religion or unsuitable clothing.
College method of study is the
biggest worry for freshmen when
i they come to the erudite "Farm.'
| Thirty-three per cent confessed tha
! this was their greatest problem
| Nine per cent (if the junior trans
! fers were also troubled by col lege
j methods.
i Junior transfers, 31 per cent ol
I them, found increased competitioi
I the ir greatest difficulty at the Uni
' versity. Thirteen per cent of the
' freshmen found this a major prob
j lem also.
