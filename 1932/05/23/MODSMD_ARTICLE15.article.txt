# EASTMAN, GRAY, MILLER BREAK TRACK RECORDS
## S.C. Wins Intercollegiates But Card Trio, Kiesel Share In Glory 
### Dick Strouse 
Stimulated by the shattering ex
plosion of six meet records, the
venerable Dean Cromwell's irre
sistible Trojans rose to unprece
dented heights while winning Sat
urday's California Intercollegiates.
To the Trojans went the spoils of
the season's most sensational track
meet, but to Stanford's Indians and
to California's Kiesel went a large
share of the glory.
Running the first 220 with his
head down, his body leaning for
ward and his legs moving fast
enough to outsprint the Trojan
sprinter Guthrie, Ben Eastman fin
is'hed his quarter-mile in 46.5 to
come within a tenth of a second of
his own new world's mark. East
man then took the baton 22 yards
behind Art Woessner, U.S.C.'s own
brilliant 440-man, in the relay, and
finished four yards behind that
same Mr. Woessner.
Olympic Prospects
Eastman was great—he was at his
own unapproachable best, but his
team-mates Nellie Gray and Bill
Miller were nearly as good. After
tv/o years of fifty-foot shot-putting,
Gray suddenly found the weight
throwers' Golden Formula or Pink
Pills or something Saturday and
registered a throw of 51 feet 9%
inches. Nellie was so excited by his
mighty toss that he neglected to
make it in the regular event, and
thus was not credited with a new
record.
As for Miller, he tied with Cap
tain Pool of California and Graber
of U.S.C. at 13 feet 10 inches, and
although ihe cross-bar didn't tum
ble at that height, the meet pole
vault record did. Miller, although
tieing, was the class of the field,
making the best vault of his career
on his first attempt.
Kiesel Takes Wykoff
Kiesel tied the official world's
100-yard dash mark and destroyed
Frank WykofT's record of never
having been defeated by a colle
giate runner in the century when
he beat the blond Trojan ace in 9.5
seconds. Wykofl was finer in defeat
than he has been in his many vic
tories, insisting on running and
chancing a beating in spite of doc
tor's orders.
Other records to fall went to Bills
of U.S.C. in the highs, Halstcad of
Southern California in the mile, and
Van Osdel of Troy in the high
jump. Cotto Herbert took a second
in the lows, and Ollie Amdahl was
again beaten by Callahan's miracu
lous sprint in the two-mile. The
country's greatest collegiate discus
throwers—Bob Jones and Here La
borde—finished as usual in that or
der, and Dave Brown won his letter
by tieing for fourth in the javelin.

enough to outsprint the Trojan
sprinter Guthrie, Ben Eastman fin
is'hed his quarter-mile in 46.5 to
come within a tenth of a second of
his own new world's mark. East
man then took the baton 22 yards
behind Art Woessner, U.S.C.'s own
brilliant 440-man, in the relay, and
finished four yards behind that
same Mr. Woessner.
Olympic Prospects
Eastman was great—he was at his
own unapproachable best, but his
team-mates Nellie Gray and Bill
Miller were nearly as good. After
tv/o years of fifty-foot shot-putting,
Gray suddenly found the weight
throwers' Golden Formula or Pink
Pills or something Saturday and
registered a throw of 51 feet 9%
inches. Nellie was so excited by his
mighty toss that he neglected to
make it in the regular event, and
thus was not credited with a new
record.
As for Miller, he tied with Cap
tain Pool of California and Graber
of U.S.C. at 13 feet 10 inches, and
although ihe cross-bar didn't tum
ble at that height, the meet pole
vault record did. Miller, although
tieing, was the class of the field,
making the best vault of his career
on his first attempt.
Kiesel Takes Wykoff
Kiesel tied the official world's
100-yard dash mark and destroyed
Frank WykofT's record of never
having been defeated by a colle
giate runner in the century when
he beat the blond Trojan ace in 9.5
seconds. Wykofl was finer in defeat
than he has been in his many vic
tories, insisting on running and
chancing a beating in spite of doc
tor's orders.
Other records to fall went to Bills
of U.S.C. in the highs, Halstcad of
Southern California in the mile, and
Van Osdel of Troy in the high
jump. Cotto Herbert took a second
in the lows, and Ollie Amdahl was
again beaten by Callahan's miracu
lous sprint in the two-mile. The
country's greatest collegiate discus
throwers—Bob Jones and Here La
borde—finished as usual in that or
der, and Dave Brown won his letter
by tieing for fourth in the javelin.
Stimulated by the shattering ex
plosion of six meet records, the
venerable Dean Cromwell's irre
sistible Trojans rose to unprece
dented heights while winning Sat
urday's California Intercollegiates.
To the Trojans went the spoils of
the season's most sensational track
meet, but to Stanford's Indians and
to California's Kiesel went a large
share of the glory.
Running the first 220 with his
head down, his body leaning for
ward and his legs moving fast
enough to outsprint the Trojan
sprinter Guthrie, Ben Eastman fin
is'hed his quarter-mile in 46.5 to
come within a tenth of a second of
his own new world's mark. East
