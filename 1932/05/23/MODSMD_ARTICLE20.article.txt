# FIVE GIVE HONOR CODE OPINIONS
## Men's Council Candidates Uphold Enforcement 
### 
i Candidates for Men's Council, in
accordance with Daily policy, have
! been asked to indicate briefly their
position regarding the Honor Code.
Statements of each follow. Candi
dates who could not be reached yes
! terday will be interviewed in time
for tomorrow's Daily.
Tom Campbell:
"That the Honor Code must be re
tained here at Stanford has been
j proven by the fact that only last
year the students voted by a large
' majority to support this system. The
Code can be upheld by the co-oper
; ation of the students, the faculty,
and an impartial council. 1 realize
that there will always be violators
' of the Code, and for these individuals
; I say give them a fair trial; and
then if they arc found guilty, let
them suffer the deserved conse
| quences.
Gilbert Carr: "The vast majority
of students are entitled to the privi
j lege of being trusted. To protect
j them against the unfair competition
of cheaters, the Men's Council
j should make punishment certain and
! uniform for all cheaters convicted.
I The discarding of the Honor Code
I would be an undesirable step back
| ward."
Bud Godfrey: "The Honor Code
I is considered an institution at Stan
! ford and upheld on that basis by
j many students. However, if it is to
; be kept, it should be only on the
I basis of a confidence in student in
| tegrity. I believe in that integrity
] as a general rule but realize that
I it is not complete. In such cases,
j enforcement of rules on misconduct
j must be absolute and with no fa
l voritism shown in any instance.
Proctoring of examinations by cer
j tain professors is a detriment."
Jack Redhead: "I believe that
there is an Honor Code in this Uni
; versify and therefore that it should
| be enforced. If I am elected I in
; tend to see that is enforced."
I Bob Wade: "In carrying out its
j duty to enforce the Honor Code,
the Council should maintain the
l freshman organization set up this
! year and make use of any other
I outside means for educating the
I student body to a better under
i standing of the Code.
"The basic essential for success
ful operation of the system, how
ever, is consistent punishment by
| the Council itself of all offenders.
