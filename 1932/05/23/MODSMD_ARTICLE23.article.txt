# SUMMER TERM OPPORTUNITIES BEST IN YEARS
## Many Noted Personalities Scheduled To Speak During Quarter MEARS HEADS FACULTY Olympic Tryouts Will Be Sports Attraction 
### 
"Stanford never offered a better
rounded series of courses in the
summer than has been arranged for
this year," declared Dr. Eliot G.
Mears, director of the summer
quarter, yesterday. "And the pros
pects for a good-sized student body,
comparable with those of recent
years, are promising."
More than three thousand indi
vidual inquiries about the summer
quarter have been received from
men and women not now students
in the University, Professor Mears
said. "These letters indicate that
more than two thousand people are
at least seriously considering taking
up studies here this summer," he
remarked.
Many Old Students
"It seems probable, also," Dr.
Mears said, "that a considerable
number of regular students will
continue their university work
through the summer this year. Un
dergraduates finding it hard to get
paying summer jobs perceive the
economic advantage of gaining a
quarter of college work now and
thus graduating that much earlier
and at a time when conditions are
better. Even among those who will
receive their degrees this spring a
good many are thinking of taking
some additional college preparation
in order to be better qualified when
the employment situation gets bet
ter. There never was a time when
employers more closely scrutinized
the educational background of those
asking them for positions."
Director Mears points out that al
though an exceptionally wide range
of courses will be offered for ad
vanced and graduate students as
has always been the case with the
summer quarter, special considera
tion has been given to the needs of
regular undergraduates this year.
"We have prepared a schedule," he
said, "which affords Lower Division
students and even those entering
the University as freshmen oppor
tunity to make out good programs.
He cited the large number of ele
mentary science courses.

"In planning the summer quarter
we have kept in mind, also," Direc
tor Mears added, "that this quarter
is in the summer, when many of
the students will particularly need
to combine recreational activities
with their regular work, and when
since many of the usual student ac
tivities will be dormant the Uni
versity itself must assume more di
rect charge.
"We will foster social activities,
co-operate to provide week - end
trips to nearby points of interest,
aid in giving students special rates
to the Hillsborough open air sym
phonies, for example. The Olympic
try-outs will be in our stadium.
"Taking advantage of the large
number of outstanding personalities
who will visit California this sum
mer, we plan a considerable number
of University assemblies as well as
several series of afternoon and eve
ning lectures.
"Of course." Dr. Mears remarked,
"climate in California is a subject of
jest, but it is true that Stanford has
a summer climate that makes the
campus exceptionally attractive as
a place where hard intellectual
work can be maintained without the
handicap of debilitating heat.

handicap of debilitating heat.
"Stanford never offered a better
rounded series of courses in the
summer than has been arranged for
this year," declared Dr. Eliot G.
Mears, director of the summer
quarter, yesterday. "And the pros
pects for a good-sized student body,
comparable with those of recent
years, are promising."
More than three thousand indi
vidual inquiries about the summer
quarter have been received from
men and women not now students
in the University, Professor Mears
said. "These letters indicate that
more than two thousand people are
at least seriously considering taking
up studies here this summer," he
remarked.
Many Old Students
"It seems probable, also," Dr.
Mears said, "that a considerable
number of regular students will
continue their university work
through the summer this year. Un
dergraduates finding it hard to get
paying summer jobs perceive the
economic advantage of gaining a
quarter of college work now and
thus graduating that much earlier
and at a time when conditions are
better. Even among those who will
receive their degrees this spring a
good many are thinking of taking
some additional college preparation
in order to be better qualified when
the employment situation gets bet
ter. There never was a time when
employers more closely scrutinized
the educational background of those
asking them for positions."
Director Mears points out that al
though an exceptionally wide range
of courses will be offered for ad
vanced and graduate students as
has always been the case with the
summer quarter, special considera
tion has been given to the needs of
regular undergraduates this year.
"We have prepared a schedule," he
said, "which affords Lower Division
students and even those entering
the University as freshmen oppor
tunity to make out good programs.
He cited the large number of ele
mentary science courses.
To Foster Activities
"In planning the summer quarter
we have kept in mind, also," Direc
tor Mears added, "that this quarter
is in the summer, when many of
the students will particularly need
to combine recreational activities
with their regular work, and when
since many of the usual student ac
tivities will be dormant the Uni
versity itself must assume more di
rect charge.
"We will foster social activities,
co-operate to provide week - end
trips to nearby points of interest,
aid in giving students special rates
to the Hillsborough open air sym
phonies, for example. The Olympic
try-outs will be in our stadium.
"Taking advantage of the large
number of outstanding personalities
who will visit California this sum
mer, we plan a considerable number
of University assemblies as well as
several series of afternoon and eve
ning lectures.
"Of course." Dr. Mears remarked,
"climate in California is a subject of
jest, but it is true that Stanford has
a summer climate that makes the
campus exceptionally attractive as
a place where hard intellectual
work can be maintained without the
handicap of debilitating heat.
