# THE 						SUMMER SCHOOL
## 
### 
One "food answer to the all - important question of
"What are yon going to do 111 is summer?" is to attend the
Stanford Summer School, which begins shortly after com
mencement and closes the first of September.
.lobs Hi is summer will be as scarce as the proverbial
lien's teeth and students would be accomplishing some-
Ihing with their time by picking up a quarter's work rather
lhan loafing through the whole vacation.
Those fortunates who have prospects of a good job
after school closes probably will not be so interested, but
for one who has nothing in sight except a three months'
search for something to do the summer school is worthy
of consideration.
Graduate students, too, setting out to conquer the world
willi a newly won sheepskin firmly gripped in the hand of
each, would do well lo consider another quarter or so of
study. A glance across the bay where that huge plant, the
I'niversity of California, recently turned out a fresh batch
of college graduates of the latest model to Hood business
centers in a frantic search for jobs will convince almost
anyone that the present is hardly a propitious time to be
gelling out of school unless one's position is already as
sured.
For this coming summer the administration has made
a special effort to provide courses of interest to under
graduates that they may be able to fill out suitable pro
grams. Formerly, due to the large number of teachers and
graduate students working for advanced degrees, under
graduates often had difficulty in obtaining courses that
I hey needed but I his summer they will be amply provided.
If one started listing the advantages of a summer quar
ter at Stanford, the article would read like a bulletin of the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. However, two might
be pointed out. Because of the small number of students
on the campus, distractions, social and otherwise, are
fewer than in a regular quarter and a student has a chance
to see what lie can accomplish minus the ever-present dis
turbances.
Also worthy of note is the list of visiting professors.
These men, coming from all over the country and even
from other nations, offer an intellectual stimulus different
from those steeped in the atmosphere of the Farm.
