# BULL SESSION
## IT'S THE OLD SHELL GAME 
### 
There will be no bell-ringing or
loud political ballyhoo tomorrow—
even though tomorrow we elect our
student body president. But there
will be enough undercurrent whis
pering to fully compensate. There
will be no boisterous proclamations
about qualifications or policies—the
former are unknown and the latter
are non-existant. In fact, somebody
dropping in from the great outside
would imagine we were having
some kind of an inter-sport popu
larity contest. And they would be
just about right in so thinking.
As far as the campus generally
is concerned, the race is between
an all-coast football guard and an
all-coast basketball forward. These
are both highly covetous positions
but do not seem to establish par
ticular qualifications for the position
at hand —the A.S.S.U. presidency. Of
course, one might argue that cor
nered by irate students, the foot
baller might crash his way loose
while the basketballer could dodge
his way into the open. Which is the
more desirable attribute is largely
a matter of opinion. Arid opinions
vary on this question.
This impartial Underwood (advt.)
does not wish to imply that the two
candidates are athletes and nothing
else. But the point is that even
though both candidates are dripping
with excellent ideas about campus
affairs, no body outside of their im
mediate circle knows about it. Both
candidates may be powerful and
clever speakers, but they are hid

ing their noise under sound-proof 1
boxes. For all the campus knows |
the men may both be incurable I
stutterers—or be minus the treus- i
ured larynxes entirely.
Superimposed on this athletic con- i
test is the ever-present hall-row
split which will also determine votes j
on no intelligent basis. In class we ;
j learn to scorn the "Solid South" for
! going Democratic with almost the'
constancy of water down hill ir
! respective of issues or candidates. |
The Stanford political lineup is j
even more ridiculous —yes, and even !
; more pediculous as well. One man
! rushes to the Dean of Men's ofTice
for a room, and the other is rushed
Iby the Greek Letter societies to fill
( up one of their stalls; and on that
| distinction, we elect our student
| body presidents.
Why not hold nominating assem
j blies where the students can look
the candidates over—where we can
i hear them speak—where we can j
■ hear their ideas or lack thereof? j
| That's not dirty politics—by any j
! stretch of the imagination. But on i
j the other hand if we admit that ,
! student body offices require no spe- j
j cial abilities—and if we admit that j
I there are no student problems, why j
I carry through the farce of student!
i self-government at all?
The quickest way to dispose of !
I anything is to make it meaningless.
' A.S.S.U. government is becoming
I devoid of meaning.
