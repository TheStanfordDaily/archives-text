j er than in the country as a whole,
; judging from a comparison of the j
' findings of a study recently made
by Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director of
Stanford's summer quarter, and a j
report by E. M. Foster of the United I
, States Bureau of Education. The I
Foster i*eport, published in a recent j
issue of School and Society, which j
will also publish Dr. Mears' study,
; forecasts that many summer schools
j throughout the nation will be closed
this year and that enrollment will be j
| greatly reduced.
Professor Mears, through ques- |
tionnaires sent to institutions in the [
; Western states, supplemented by
j personal interviews with heads of
j summer sessions, reached the con
; elusions that in this section sum
! mer schools are not being closed
; and that attendance is on the whole ;
keeping up its pace. Enrollment
i statistics give no portent of decline,
i he has found; if anything they show
: an opposite tendency.
Dr. Mears has also found that
I there is a strong tendency towards
: making Western summer session
programs conform to the standards
of the regular academic year, with i

less emphasis by their directors on i
'"scenic and social attractions" and j
! more on "serious purpose rather j
i than educational recreation."
"I would hazard the guess," he
said, "that the statements attributed !
to Mr. Foster are more applicable
ito weaker than to stronger sum
| mer schools; furthermore, that the j
influences riled are not likely to be i
i felt in svich pronounced form on the
Western frontier as in the United !
i States as a whole."
