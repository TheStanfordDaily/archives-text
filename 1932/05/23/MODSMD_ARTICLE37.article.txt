LETTY LYNTON—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
There is no point in telling you I
- to be sure to see this show because j
! no one knowingly misses a Craw- j
ford-Montgomery picture. You!
I might, however, be interested in j
| knowing what kind of a show it is. j
Joan Crawford is a lady with a
past and the "past master" is Nils |
: Astor, just a big lover from South :
America. Joan is thrillingly glamor- J
I ous and the gowns which she wears |
j are no drawback. Robert Montgom- j
i ery is his usual irresistible self, j
having always the best possible re- j
i ply at his tongue's tip.
The story is full of action and j
drama and is presented at a high i
j emotional pitch. What's more, the
picture has a theme and is not just |
an excuse for some good-looking'
clothes and some smart lines.
Monday night, Pietro Brescia, j
formerly with the Paul Ash band, 1
j is presenting his orchestra at the !) j
' o'clock performance. According to
rumors floating about, this orches- j
i tra has some real music tucked j
away waiting for a chance to get
out. —E.E.H. j
VIGO, Spain, May 22. (/P) — The
giant German seaplane DO-X ar
i rived here today from llorta, Azores,
* on its homeward way to Lake Con
stance, Switzerland.
