### Bob Wade 
After spotting the visitors to two j
runs in (lie early innings, Stanford's
big guns found Pitcher Kikutani's J
range and pounded out a 9-3 victory
over Rikkyo University on the |
Sunken Diamond Friday afternoon. !
Anderson was in fine form, con- I
sidering the amount of practice the
Redshirts have had lately, allowing
seven hits, four walks, and fanning
three. The Japanese scored in the
second, third, and seventh frames, j
but aside from that the big sopho
more had them in hand throughout
the contest.
Overcome Lead
The Indians tied the game up in j
the fourth, with a two-run splurge, I
and then opened up in the sixth '
inning. Trautman was safe on j
Uchida's error. Livermore singled, |
Miles drew one of Kikutani's three
walks, and Anderson clouted the i
ball to right field. Kunitomo tried i
to play it on his right side to get
the throw away faster, and the elu- \
sive horsehide skidded past him j
into deep right. Trautman, Liver
more, and Miles scored, and Ander- j
son went to third on the play for !
Miles at home. He scored a minute |
later when Delmas singled.
Rikkyo got one back in the sev
enth, and then the Redshirts fin- \
ished up with successive homers in j
the eighth by Rintala and Delmas. !
It was Captain Rudy's last time at j
bat for Stanford, and he ended his j
collegiate baseball career by spank- 1
ing the ball between Miura and
Nakajima in deep left-center.
Rudy Beats Throw
Captain Sekiguchi, at shortstop,
took the throw and faked a relay :
home, trying to hold Rintala at '
third. Rudy took the chance and J
beat the ball to end up with a four- j
base blow. Delmas followed with i
another merry-go-round poke, and i
the visitors were willing to call it |
quits.
For Rikkyo, Nakajima, center- j
fielder and lead-off man in the bat- j
ling order, was the outstanding i
slugger. He collected three for five, 1
including a double, the only extra- !
base blow Anderson allowed.
