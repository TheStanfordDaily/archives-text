# STANFORD TO OFFER VARIED ATHLETIC OPPORTUNITIES TO SUMMER STUDENTS
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Surrounded on all sides by the
1 last word in athletic equipment—
! paraphernalia suited alike for the
! prospective Olympic champion or
; the pleasure-loving beginner seek
| ing relaxation after a morning of
j hard study—and with an opportun
j ity to watch in practice and compe
j tition the greatest athletes in the
j world, the summer session student
I at Stanford will find the Farm, with
j its many stadia, and well-appointed
| gyms, courts, and links, a true ath
j lete's paradise.
i Swimming will undoubtedly prove
the greatest attraction for summer
session visitors, although the cam
pus is never oppressively hot. Three
men's swimming pools with the best
of diving equipment, and one equally
up-to—date woman's pool will en
able students to swim at any time
of the day.
Also Ocean-Bathing
Those who prefer ocean-bathing
I may indulge in week-end or shorter
! excursions to Half Moon Bay, a one
j hour's drive from the campus, or
i to Santa Cruz and Aptos, about two
i hours distant.
The Stanford eighteen-hole golf
i course has been justly named the
finest layout on the Pacific Coast,
with its tricky, sporty fairways, na
tural hazards, and carefully watered
greens. Although even the best of
golfers could never grow tired of
the great variety of the Stanford
course, there are many other
eighteen-hole courses within a few
miles of the campus. Special rates
are available for Stanford students
and visitors on the home course.
.'5O Tennis Courts
Tennis courts, more than thirty
in all, which have been pronounced
perfect by such champions as Helen
Wills Moody and Ellsworth Vines,
i will greet the tennis-minded and

racquet-handed student. There are
courts reserved for men and women
exclusively, as well as an. adequate
supply of courts for the use of both
sexes.
Two men's gymnasiums without
peer and one of the most beautiful
and complete women's gymnasiums
in the world are spacious and litted
with facilities for every type of
game and exercise.
Football, Baseball, Polo
Many football fields, baseball
fields, polo fields, and three running j
tracks will be available for the use j
of those who wish to indulge in j
these sports.
Those who are not athletic en- |
thusiasts will have a hard time re- j
sisting the charm and thrill of two ,
track meets which should provide j
the greatest performances and com- j
petition of any national meets in
the history of American athletics. '
These meets are the 1.C.4-A. track j
and field championships (one of the I
semi-final Olympic tryouts) to be I
held at Berkeley on July 1 and 2, j
and final American Olympic Games j
tryouts, July 1G and 17, in the Stan- I
ford Stadium.
Eastman to Train Here
Campus residents will also have
the opportunity of watching the
daily training of Ben Eastman, the i
greatest middle-distance runner of
all time, and other athletes of the ;
Frank WykofT, Bob Kiesel, and
Eastman caliber.
In August, after the final Olympic !
Games have been finished at Los 1
Angeles, the glamor and thrills of j
international competition will be
brought to the very campus door
step. Then the United States-British
Empire, Interallied Games, and
Germany-Japan track meets will be
held in San Francisco, "the Paris
of America," which is a mere forty
minute drive from Stanford.
