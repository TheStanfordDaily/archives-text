# GEOLOGY STUDENTS OFFERED COURSES AT NEVADA CAMP
## Belgian Professor To Head Department For Field Work On Campus 
### 
Advanced students in geology arc
offered exceptional opportunities for
field work during the summer quar
ter at the Stanford Geological Sur
vey summer camp at Lovelock, Ne
vada.
This practical work, which is a
necessary part of the student geolo
gist's training, was established by
Dr. J. C. Branner, in 1891, when the
University opened. This year, con
trary to custom, work in geology
will also be offered on the campus
under Professor Paul Fourmarier of
ihe University of Liege, Belgium,
and will include both beginning and
advanced courses.
In the field work during the first
term of the summer quarter, ihe
geology of the region reached from
around the camp will be worked
out and plotted upon topographic
maps and sections. All methods of
geological mapping where a topo
graphic map is used as the base are
taken up. Geological mappings, eon
trolled by instrumental surveying,
will be studied during the second
term.
Advanced registration in these
courses is necessary in order that
students may procure equipment
and that transportation and camp
plans may be perfected. For this
reason, Professors Cyrus Tolman,
Paul Kerr (of Columbia University),
and Siemon Muller, who will have
charge of the work, ask that all
registration for it be completed by
June 21.
