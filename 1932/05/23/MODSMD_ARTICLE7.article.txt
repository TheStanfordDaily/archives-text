# CARDS CAPTURE POLO TITLE IN OREGON SERIES
## Stanford Wins Final Game 10-3 For First Coast Championship 
### Bill Myers 
Even the most skeptical polo en
thusiasts were convinced of the
championship caliber of the Card
riders as the Redshirts thundered
to a 10-3 win over Oregon State in
the finals of the coast champion
ship Saturday.
Squelching an early spurt of the
Beavers in the opening chukkers,
the Cards soon piled up a lead that
was never threatened for the re
mainder of the game. Shooting was
much more accurate in Saturday's
game than in Thursday's match. Ap
parently impossible shots from the
corners were made regularly.
Intercollegiate Champions
Stanford is now the intercollegi
ate champion of the Pacific Coast for
the first time in history. Along with
the intercollegiate title goes the
Low-Goal crown, which includes all
teams on the coast rated at less
than eight goals.
Pete Gillham, playing at number
one for the Redshirts, scored five
goals which alone would have been
enough to win. It was no startling
display of individual brilliancy be
hind this unusual string of tallies,
but rather a combination of brilliant
teamwork and accurate passing by
the entire team.
Game Spectacular
In spite of the lopsided score the
game was the most spectacular seen
at the Farm this year. Tremendous
drives, Cossack-like riding, and
hair-splitting goal shots made the
match as thrilling as any profes
sional tilt. Spills were a'plenty on
the slick turf. Riders on the Oregon
outfit smacked the sod three times
and narrowly missed being pinned
under their ponies.
Closing minutes of play found
Bruce Fleming, captain of the Stan
ford four, suffering badly from a
leg injury which has kept him dis
abled for the last month. Until the
last chukker Fleming turned in as
flashy a game as anyone on the field
although the logical place for him
would have been on the cripples'
bench.
