# Brown, Hand Argue Council Change Plan
## Appointive Council Would Not Have Support, Hand Declares 
### 
(Editor's Note: Milton Iland,
chairman of Men's Council, pre
sents herewith his views regard
ing Amendment I, to be voted upon
in today's election.)
The amendment intended to make
the office of Men's Council appoint
ive is not the climax of any con
certed student movement. It is an
idea of one man whose office would
be most concerned in case the
amendment is passed, namely the
office of A.S.S.U. president. He and
his followers are sincere in purpose
but by their proposal they express
a lack of faith in the judgment of
the student body in respect to the
Honor Code and the selection of
representatives entrusted with its
enforcement and promotion.
The Honor Code will never be
more successful in operation than
it is now if any of the present re
sponsibility is taken from the shoul
ders of the individual student. The
establishment of the Code as a basic
Stanford tradition depends upon us
all.
Unprejudiced
Difficult and unprejudiced deci
sions are made by councilmen who
realize that they are responsible not
to a small appointing committee but
directly to the whole student body.
The contention is made that those
who make up the Council are too
often varsity athletes elected solely
on their athletic prestige. It should
be observed that while this has at
certain times in the past been partly
true, the increased student interest
in the Code assures for us the men
best fitted for the office. An exam
ination of the present list of candi
dates does not reveal a single var
sity letter man. On the other hand
the man who will be elected px-esi
dent of the A.S.S.U. today is one of
two men who are popular athletes.
Council Separate
The duties and responsibilities of
the Men's Council are wholly di
vorced from the Executive Com
mittee and should remain so. In
order to protect the accuser and the
accused as well as the name of the
University from harmful and un
necessary publicity the sessions of
the council are closed to all not
connected with the cases. Neither
the President nor the Executive
Committee members understand
better than the average student the
problems of the council. They are
therefore no more qualified to make
appointments to that body. If an
appointive council were desirable,
the chairman of the council is the
only man on the proposed commit
tee who is in a position to know the
problems of his office.
The Men's Council must feel that
it has the support of the whole stu
dent body. The present members
are rewarded with the feeling that
they have had this support. They
are likewise exceedingly glad that
they have functioned in the direct
interest of not three men but three
thousand Stanford men and women.
Stanford has always maintained a
forward and optimistic policy. The
move to make the office of Men's
Council appointive reflects an atti
tude of pessimism and if successful
means a step backward, a step which
must be avoided. Vote NO.

University from harmful and un
necessary publicity the sessions of
the council are closed to all not
connected with the cases. Neither
the President nor the Executive
Committee members understand
better than the average student the
problems of the council. They are
therefore no more qualified to make
appointments to that body. If an
appointive council were desirable,
the chairman of the council is the
only man on the proposed commit
tee who is in a position to know the
problems of his office.
The Men's Council must feel that
it has the support of the whole stu
dent body. The present members
are rewarded with the feeling that
they have had this support. They
are likewise exceedingly glad that
they have functioned in the direct
interest of not three men but three
thousand Stanford men and women.
Stanford has always maintained a
forward and optimistic policy. The
move to make the office of Men's
Council appointive reflects an atti
tude of pessimism and if successful
means a step backward, a step which
must be avoided. Vote NO.
(Editor's Note: Milton Iland,
chairman of Men's Council, pre
sents herewith his views regard
ing Amendment I, to be voted upon
in today's election.)
The amendment intended to make
the office of Men's Council appoint
ive is not the climax of any con
certed student movement. It is an
idea of one man whose office would
be most concerned in case the
amendment is passed, namely the
office of A.S.S.U. president. He and
his followers are sincere in purpose
but by their proposal they express
a lack of faith in the judgment of
the student body in respect to the
Honor Code and the selection of
representatives entrusted with its
enforcement and promotion.
The Honor Code will never be
more successful in operation than
it is now if any of the present re
sponsibility is taken from the shoul
ders of the individual student. The
establishment of the Code as a basic
Stanford tradition depends upon us
all.
Unprejudiced
Difficult and unprejudiced deci
sions are made by councilmen who
realize that they are responsible not
to a small appointing committee but
directly to the whole student body.
The contention is made that those
who make up the Council are too
often varsity athletes elected solely
on their athletic prestige. It should
be observed that while this has at
certain times in the past been partly
true, the increased student interest
in the Code assures for us the men
best fitted for the office. An exam
ination of the present list of candi
dates does not reveal a single var
sity letter man. On the other hand
the man who will be elected px-esi
dent of the A.S.S.U. today is one of
two men who are popular athletes.
Council Separate
The duties and responsibilities of
the Men's Council are wholly di
vorced from the Executive Com
mittee and should remain so. In
order to protect the accuser and the
accused as well as the name of the
University from harmful and un
necessary publicity the sessions of
the council are closed to all not
connected with the cases. Neither
the President nor the Executive
Committee members understand
