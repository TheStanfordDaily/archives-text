# Brown Avows Amendment Would Take Council Out Of Politics

[ (Editor's Note: Robert M. Brown,
A.S.S.U. president, presents here
with his views regarding Amend
ment I. to be voted upon in today's
election.)
i In the Southern schools where the
tradition is observe the Honor
Code as well as to enforce it, the
Honor Council has long been an ap
pointive body. The success of those
councils is illustrative of the advan
j tages of appointment, but the state
ment is intended to show only that
the appointive system is not a radi
cal change, not an untried expedient
which might retard the progress the
Honor Code has been making.
Important Post
j A position on the Men's Council is
| one of the most important our stu-
I dent body has to offer, and the
qualifications of a proper member
! are most exacting. V/e feel that the
proposed manner of appointing will
be an effective means of securing
the proper men. Three students
unite in making the appointment
(1) the chairman of the Men's
Council—he will contribute a knowl
edge of actual work of the council
and the type of man best suited to
do that work. He can inform pros
pective members as to what their
| duties will involve so that the coun
j cil will not contain men who did
j not realize the importance of the
| position and were not prepared for
it. (2) The Graduate member of the
Executive Committee —his more ma
ture mind will aid in the selection
i of men of sound judgment and ad
! ministrative ability. (3) The student
j body president—his wide scope of
I acquaintances and his familiarity
j with student problems will assist
; in the securing of the most able
! men.
Able Appointments
The salient argument against the
i proposed change is that the commit
tee of selection has not sufficient
I strength of character to divorce
■ itself from purely political consid
erations in making the appoint
ments. To this argument we offer
three answers. First, we believe
that the three men in question will
make an honest attempt to select
the best men available. Every man
in such a position realizes the im
portance of the Men's Council and
the sense of honor among Stanford
men has not fallen so low that he
would use the power of appoint
ment as a source of political graft.
The appointments are made prior
[ to the elections by the men then in
j office. (These men are not seeking
: re-election so there is little incen-
I tive or opportunity for political
, bargaining.) Each usually represents
i a different organization which les
; sens the possibility of house or club
control. Second, an examination of
i the roster of men who have held
1 these three offices over a period of
years reveals on the whole an able
and upstanding type of student—a
student who has had the interest
of the University in mind and would
not violate his duty to pay political
debts. Third, there is no question of
introducing politics into the selec
tion of members of the council. The
present system is purely political.
Athletic Couticilmen
In five years twenty out of twenty
seven members have been outstand
ing athletics. (Many were good men,
but athletic fame is no criteria by
which men should be chosen for
such an office.) In some cases the
results were unsatisfactory. At least
two members of the council were
known violators of the Honor Code,
others did not believe in it, and
many have not known how to ad
minister it properly. The evils pre
dicted for the appointive system are
present in the elective system. A
hall will and has within recent
knowledge voted solidly for its man.
Prospective candidates trade sup
port and attempt to organize tickets.
The proposed change will certainly
make matters no worse and offers a
good opportunity for improvement.
This discussion is not to be con
strued as a reflection upon the pres
ent Men's Council which has done
excellent work. It is to be remem
bered that these appointments, as all
others, are subject to the approval
of the Executive Committee. •

j A position on the Men's Council is

I dent body has to offer, and the

unite in making the appointment
(1) the chairman of the Men's

do that work. He can inform pros

The salient argument against the
i proposed change is that the commit
tee of selection has not sufficient
I strength of character to divorce
■ itself from purely political consid
erations in making the appoint
ments. To this argument we offer
three answers. First, we believe
that the three men in question will
make an honest attempt to select
the best men available. Every man
in such a position realizes the im
portance of the Men's Council and
the sense of honor among Stanford
men has not fallen so low that he
would use the power of appoint
ment as a source of political graft.

[ to the elections by the men then in
j office. (These men are not seeking
: re-election so there is little incen-
I tive or opportunity for political
, bargaining.) Each usually represents
i a different organization which les
; sens the possibility of house or club
control. Second, an examination of
i the roster of men who have held
1 these three offices over a period of
years reveals on the whole an able
and upstanding type of student—a
student who has had the interest
of the University in mind and would
not violate his duty to pay political
debts. Third, there is no question of
introducing politics into the selec
tion of members of the council. The
present system is purely political.
Athletic Couticilmen
In five years twenty out of twenty
seven members have been outstand

but athletic fame is no criteria by
which men should be chosen for
such an office.) In some cases the
results were unsatisfactory. At least
two members of the council were
known violators of the Honor Code,
others did not believe in it, and
many have not known how to ad
