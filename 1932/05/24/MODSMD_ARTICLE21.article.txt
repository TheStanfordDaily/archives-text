The statements follow:
DAVE DAVIS
"A year at Columbia under the
best possible proctor system con
vinced me that the only effective bar
to cheating is a man's personal
sense of honor. I believe that the
work of the present council in ac
quainting new men with the Honor
Code should be continued and that
impartial judgment, then definite
punishment should be given con
victed cheaters. By these methods
we can make the code an institution
at Stanford."
JOHN HUNEKE
"The Honor Code is a custom or a
standard in this school passively be
lieved in by a majority of the stu
dents. As long as it remains thus in
practice it must be strictly and im
partially enforced. This can only be
done by a conscientious council un
influenced by political ties or per
sonal factors. Hence I favor the
Men's Council amendment proposed
as a constructive step forward in
student government. With such a
Council, the intelligent co-operation
of the administration and the active
approval of the students, the Honor
Code is assured of success."
HUGH B. MILLER
"I believe the Honor System
should be strictly enforced."
