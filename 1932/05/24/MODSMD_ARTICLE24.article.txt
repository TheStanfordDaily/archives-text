# Political Fever at New High as Farm Votes on 27 Posts
## Polls Open at 8:30; Close at 2 Today; Six Candidates Decline to Run; Wilbur Lists Qualifications, Election Officials, Voting Rules ONLY MEN WITH 45 UNITS VOTE FOR COUNCIL Chairman Warns Against Improper Marking of Ballots To Avoid Discarded Votes 
### 
Eighty-eight candidates for 27 offices.
Five amendments.
These will face the student body when it goes to the polls today in the
year's biggest politics fest, the annual spring elections.
The polls, located on the Quad near the Law Steps, will open at 8:30
o'clock and will close at 2 o'clock, with attendants in charge during the
day. A total of 91 candidates were nominated last week, but five declined
during the regular period, and another declined last night. Marvin I'ol
lard, finding that he was too late to decline constitutionally his'i nomination
for student body vice-president, issued the following statement last night:
"My nomination for vice-president of the A.S.S.U. was not desired by mc.

>1 request my friends not to vote for
me, but to give their support to one
of the other candidates."
Marking Ballots
Ray Wilbur, Election Board chair
man, warns voters to mark their
ballots in no other way than with
an "X" in ink. "'At every election,"
Wilbur said, "we have a large num
ber of improperly marked ballots.
All these must be discarded. In
many cases it is possible that a bal
lot or two will determine the out
come of a particular vote, and it is
important that all ballots be marked
strictly to directions."
Statements of three Men's Coun
cil candidates who were not inter
viewed in yesterday's Daily appear
today in another column, as do
opinions of Robert M. Brown, stu
dent body president, and "Red"

garding the amendment which would
make Men's Council an appointive
body.

Eighty-eight candidates for 27 offices.
Five amendments.
These will face the student body when it goes to the polls today in the
year's biggest politics fest, the annual spring elections.
The polls, located on the Quad near the Law Steps, will open at 8:30
o'clock and will close at 2 o'clock, with attendants in charge during the

lard, finding that he was too late to decline constitutionally his'i nomination
for student body vice-president, issued the following statement last night:
"My nomination for vice-president of the A.S.S.U. was not desired by mc.

>1 request my friends not to vote for
me, but to give their support to one
of the other candidates."
Marking Ballots
Ray Wilbur, Election Board chair
man, warns voters to mark their
ballots in no other way than with
an "X" in ink. "'At every election,"
Wilbur said, "we have a large num
ber of improperly marked ballots.
All these must be discarded. In
many cases it is possible that a bal
lot or two will determine the out
come of a particular vote, and it is
important that all ballots be marked
strictly to directions."
Statements of three Men's Coun
cil candidates who were not inter
viewed in yesterday's Daily appear
today in another column, as do
opinions of Robert M. Brown, stu
dent body president, and "Red"
Hand, Men's Council chairman, re
garding the amendment which would
make Men's Council an appointive
body.

tions, including the various Execu
tive Committee posts, may be voted
