# AN APPOINTIVE COUNCIL

### 
In today's IWiil Session Abe Mellinkoff urges students to i
voie against the proposed amendment to tlie A.S.S.I'. ('on-; 4
stitution making the Men's Council appointive hv the stu-jj
dent body president, the graduate member of the K\ C.oiii-'i
mittee and the chairman of the Council. !f
The arguments against appointing the members boil
down to two. First, the relationship between the Council:
and the student body would he less tangible than under the j
present system, which would antagonize the students;
against the Council in the event of an unfavorable decision.!
Secondly, the appointing body is an unknown quantity and,'
unless the men were honest and sincere, dirtv politics, club 1
affiliations and other evils might influence the appoint
ments. ' h
The lirst point is an abstract idea and there is no basis! l
for supposing that a less direct relationship between the j '
student body and the Council might be a disadvantage. ;
The second argument, however, is very real. Weak and 1
inetlicient men would probably appoint a weak and inef-l|
licient Council. Hut it is a chance that must be taken. Cer- ]
lainly, under ordinary circumstances, three men, holding j'
responsible positions and fully cognizant of the necessity
of appointing capable men to the Council, are better able :
to pick the men than are the students, whose only basis ofM
choice is the athletic prowess of the candidates or thejj
prominence of back-slapping politicians. ;
Although the present Council has done admirably, itsj
success should not blind the students to the fact that in the
pas! former Councils have not been so capable. The ap
pointive system is worth a try. If it is a failure, it should be,
discarded in favor of another plan. The Honor Code is in j
the experimental stage and the present system is far from 1
perfection. It is only through change that it can be im
proved and the proposed change is an earnest attempt for
betterment, lis success or failure can never be ascertained
until it is tried.
