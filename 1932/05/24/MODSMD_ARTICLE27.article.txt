### 
Willi Ihe most important election of the year on tap |
today, student attention may well be directed to a pair of j
facts which apply to all balloting here.
1. The last few campus elections have been remark-j
able chielly for the extremely light vote cast.
2. Results of past elections have seemed to indicate i
thai social and athletic prominancc are the only standards'
used bv voters in making choices among the candidates.
k !
While it is 100 much to sav that student government
depends upon a strong turnout today, there can be no |
doubt that a long-continued lack of interest would have
\erv detrimental efleets upon the elliciencv of the A.S.S.I'.,
organization and might furnish Ihe administration with a
strong argument if it ever comes to question the compe
tence of student government. This is as good a time as any
to break the present lethargic attitude toward voting.
In regard to the second point, it should be obvious that
social or athletic prowess does not necessarily confer upon
its possessor Ihe ability to fill an oflice. There are just as;
many good potential ollice holders among the athletes and
society leaders as are to be found in other groups, but they
have no monopoly of political qualifications.
The student body can make a long step forward if it
will vote for its favorites on the basis of real opinions and
abilities, rather than because thev have been successful in
other fields.
