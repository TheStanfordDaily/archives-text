A combination of I lie Massie cast', llic rough question,
and various editorials has recently kept the Daily flooded
with campus opinions written by aroused students and fac- j
ulty meinhers. These communications are always welcome,
being a sign of reader interest, hut, unfortunately, many of
the letters received in the past few weeks have been written
without regard for the space limitations of a newspaper.
There is only a certain amount of room on the editorial
page of this paper, and the C.anipus Opinion section cannot
he allowed to monopolize all of it. It is frequently impos
sible to run five or six pages of typewritten opinion without !
leaving out other features which should be used. Conse
quently. the I) \u/s is forced to establish a limit of 250 words
on all letters sent in for publication. Whenever possible
all communications, of whatever length, will be published,
but no responsibility will he assumed for those which ex
ceed the word limit.
Members of the editorial staff of the Daii.y will be able
to hear the present powers above berate and flatter them
for the last time today at the usual place at the usual time.
I )o not miss this unusual opportunity.
