# BULL SESSION
## APPOINT OR ELECT? 
### 
It is a great attribute to be able i
I to see to the root of a problem and
then gnaw away at that root like a
i voracious gopher. But very often it
' is necessary to trim the overhang
ing branches and ignore the basic
1 structure almost entirely. It is al
ways more stimulating to play the
] gopher—an esoteric and deadly
j creature. The gardener who merely
trims is not emotionally stirring.
Thus it is that in the present prob
; lem to be decided today, "Elect or
appoint the Men's Council," we
must deliberately ignore the root of
the question.
The basic problem is the demo
! cracy of election or the efficiency of
j appointment. On both of these
j themes, blood pressure can rise and
: orators can rant. Those who favor
! election cry dirty politics. Those
1 who favor appointment cry dirty
1 politics. Unfortunately both groups
are right. It is impossible to alien
ate politics from government unless
' we had God-almighty doing the job
| and then some of the saints would
be very apt to engage in a little
lobbying for some especially tie
serving soul.
If politics adhere in both systems
who do we favor the present sys
| tern? Why do we favor what seems
' the rough approximations inherent
in election? Why do we favor a
"NO" vote in today's election? Per
! Mit us to answer ourselves. The ef
j ficiency of appointing assumes ef
ficient appointers. The mere system
j guarantees nothing. Three students
| would do the appointing. This year

| the three concerned seem to us to
Ibe able and honest. But what is
j there that will assure continuous
I ability in these posts.
J Even since our fairly recent en
trance through what have since be
come known as the "Gates," there
have been students holding the of
fice who could not have been trusted
with the appointing of the Men's
! Council. If history repeats itself, may
! not such blokes once more appear
on the scene? And if they do, should
they have the right to try students
for the most serious crimes one can
commit on this fair campus?
The problem is not between choos
ing athletes by the ballot box and
experts by three students. If it
were, everyone would favor the ap
i pointing system. The choice is be
j tween letting the maligned masses
J (justifyably, maligned usually) se
| lect judges; or on the other hand,
j allowing three unchecked students
;—elected without pledges of any
| kind—pick judges on grounds of
I ability if they desire to use such a
I basis,*, or if they do not—personal
'friendship, social or political obli
gation, or anything else.
j In choosing between the devil and
| the deep-blue sea, I choose the sea
of popular election because from
the devil there is no escape while
! Ihe sea has its possibilities. Between
| the fire and the frying pan, I would
i vote "NO"—against the choosing of
| judges by individuals who are not
j inherently better qualified than we
j student masses. —Abe Mellinkoff
