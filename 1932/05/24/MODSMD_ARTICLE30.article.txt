BLESSED EVENT—At the Alcazar)
Theatre, San Francisco.
This is the play that probably sent j
Walter Winchell into his recent and |
much-publicized nervous break
down. It is the story of a New Yawk
colyumist and is all too obviously i
a caricature of Mrs. Winchell's bad i
little boy himself in person. It is,
comedy, not high, in fact at times !
quite low, and the lines and gags !
listened enough like Walter's famous !
column to have been a steal from |
them.
The Alcazar goes in for tempor
arily idle movie stars with almost
invariable success and in getting
Reginald Denny to play Alvin Rob
erts, the colyumist, they have done
as well as ever. He races his lines
too much at first but when one
settles down to his rate it is to j
laugh and immoderately at that. But
out of a large cast Isabel Withers
as the colyumist's secretary, deftly
j extricates the cake, and very fine
first-rate, tasty cake it is, too. Sec
-1 ond only to her comes Claudia Dell,
I as the review editor of the Roberts
j paper. She makes some pithy and
j very appropriate remarks on the
! trials and tribulations of a news
paper reviewer which were person-
I ally very much appreciated.
The plot hangs together well and
j us not too involved even though it
i does involve an exciting gang ele-
I ment and a crooner orchestra leader
! who all too obviously represents
| Ben Bernie. The action is fast
j enough to put the annoying hat un
j der the seat in a good state for the
j cleaner and the blocker, and the
j lines are of the sort which induce
j manifestations of humorous appre
' ciation I'anging all the way along ihe
j scale from the abdominal bellow to
I the discreet snigger.
( May the play run long and hilari
| ously. —S.C'.A.
MISLEADING LADY—At the Var-
I sity Theatre.
One begins to see a faint gleam
jof hope shining dimly from the
! scattered masses of Hollywood's
studios, at least a hope that there
j is a chance of a certain amount of
i light entertainment of which the
place is capable, when one sees a
j show of ihis sort.
Even though the film only begins
! to take advantage of an unusually
l amusing idea, it is still to be laughed
fc.t, at times even heartily. The bored
i society bud, Claudette Colbert, de
| cides to take up the stage and
I wagers the play producer a pro
■ posal from the fascinating mining
) engineer, Edmund Lowe, against a
job as the leading siren in his next
| show. You can imagine the rest. She
I falls in love, of course, of course,
of course—but wait! The catch is
i how and by whom.
The answer to that being Stewart

I i
| Erwin, an erstwhile Napoleon es- j
| caped from the local asylum. We
| are not often treated to a display
j of benign lunacy on the screen, but
j it is difficult to imagine it being j
j done better. Claudette does not j
J sing for once which makes one be- I
[gin to think that singing is the thing ,
] she does best. Edmund Lowe makes
j the best of good lines—looks like i
J the younger Barrymore and talks
I like that amiable idiot, Robert
! Montgomery. The rest of the cast
is significant, but "Boney" steals
the show.
Shorts—the shorter the better.
