# CAMPUS OPINION
## "HELLO SUCKER" 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
I II is refreshing to note that in j
!cpite of the present distressing eco
j nomic crisis, we still have one in-;
I stitution on our campus that has j
i not entered into the spixit oi the '
j "depression." I refer, Mr. Editor, to j
'that glorious institution of gastro
j rnic mysteries, the Union Cellar. No
institution has resisted more nobly '
the present tendency toward defla- j
tion of prices. It. has staunchly j
clung to its 1929 high standards of
service, frugality, and above all, J
prices. At no time has our own co- '
| operative, non-profit making pro-j
| ject entered into anything that i
might be termed a price war with J
! the local merchants of Palo Alto. ,
Quite the contrary, the staid old J
Cellar has pursued its dignified |
course through these years recog-j
nizing no competitors and ever
holding the ancient Roman slogan,
"Caveat emptor."
In choosing its personnel, the
policy of the Cellar has been equally
commendatory. In so far as feasible,
the Cellar has avoided the demean
ing influence of engaging self-sup
porting and indigent students, se
lecting instead to preside over its
sumptuous domains the lordly sci
ons of Howard Street aristocracy,
i With dignified disdain they "hasten"
' to serve their humble clientelle with
condescension that is to be rivalled
I only in the Stanford Bookstore.
However, in conclusion, may we
offer the construction that a proto
type of the immortal Texas Guinan
be employed to welcome each np
j proaching patron with that friendly
I greeting, "Hello Sucker."
Fraternally yours,
