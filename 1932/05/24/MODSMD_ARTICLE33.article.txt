# BACKING UP BUNTING

### 
j The Editor, Sir:
i Mr. MellinkofT is interested pri
j marily in the sensational. He rattles
oft' a daily column and, in common
with most journalists, thinks but
: little of the results to society in
j general. Now, it seems to me that
we must include in Miss Bunting's
'"finer things" your God, your coun
try, and your family. If Mr. Mellin
j koffs philosophy is followed, you
• can have none of these as sources
of happiness.
I It seems to me that the bull-ses
| sioner destructs via his pen, but
| offers us nothing as recompense for
what is taken. Some of the wiser
i wags around the Farm will declare
that Miss Bunting has yet to be
emancipated from her doctrines of
j the Middle Ages, and as for this
writer . . . ! Well, here's to the past
l and the old ideals—the ones that

gave us the fine, clean Washington.?, j
Lincolns, Roosevelts, and Wilsons! j
We'll accept your new theories when
you offer u.s something higher in
the scale of humanity than Russia's '
Mr. Lenin. Sincerely yours,
Howard Lowe, '35
