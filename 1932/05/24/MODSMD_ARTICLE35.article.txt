The Editor, Sir:
1 refer to the editorials of the
current staff—you have a reviewing
board and you have an editorial
board —the object of the reviewing
board is to review and they do at
least a passable job of it. But ap
parently the object of the editorial
board is to stoop to the sheerest
personalities and to express the un
' foundt.*d and unsupported opinions
lof one poorly informed student.
| Why not let your reviewers handle
their own field?
Mr. Editor, you have shown your
self indiscreet, petty, ignorant, and
decidedly harmful in your editorial
concerning the Junior Opera, and
in my estimation, the only course
i open to you is a public apology.
