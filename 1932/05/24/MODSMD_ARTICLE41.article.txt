Stanford expects to take a hand
n collecting the United States' first,
;econd, third, and fourth places in
lie Olympic pole vault.
Coach Bill Ellington, sitting in a
Datch of shade beside the track
louse, takes his pipe out of his
nouth to tell just why:
Because Bill Miller, smooth
imber, well-knit, English-looking
r arm truck prodigy, may clear the
>ar at 14 feet 3 inches in the Olym
>ics, to make world history.
Miller tied Bill Graber of U.S.C.

ind George Poole of California at
3 feet 10 inches a few days ago,
n his first competition of the sea
on.
"He is a stylist," Ellington enthu
iastieally describes him. "Besides
hat, he has speed. By lifting his
inle grip four inches, I believe we
an get him vaulting easily above
4 feet, and without much doubt
t 14 feet three inches.
Ted Lee, Yale University junior,
i a second great prospect.
Lee Barnes holds the present
world's record, at a mere 14 feet
Vz inches.
Lindroth of Sweden (13 feet 5
nches), his fellow countryman,
Sukyen of Sweden (13 feet BV;>
aches) will form the bulk of the
Jordic threat.
Mikio Oda of Japan adds thirteen
aot vaulting ability to his superla
ive hop-step-and-jumping, broad
umping and high-jumping.
Heymann of Germany, not very
xperienced, has shown great prom
ise in the little bit of competition
