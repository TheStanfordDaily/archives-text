JOE CUSTER, presiding genius (
lof the San Jose Mercury-Herald i
i sports department, was all a-twitter j
] the other night. ''It looks," said he, j
j "as if Ben Eastman has been keep-
I ing something from us."
j '"Ben," we replied, "is an upright j
! young man who is kind to animals." j
j Disregarding the interruption, Joe !
| went on to explain himself. "Mr. |
Reliable Source," he said, "has it I
that Eastman ran the MILE the j
other night in practice in four min- j
utes and eight seconds. Not only i
that, but he reports that Eastman ,
' will attempt to break the world's
: rceord in the four-lap event this
1 summer following the I.C.A.A.A.A.
, meet."
IT WOULD seem, however,
that friend. Custer must have
stumbled onto Mr. Reliable
Source when the old man was
in a very low condition because
of putting too much yeast in the
last batch, or something.
Apparently the basis of the
report was the three-lap jog
Eastman reeled off a week or so 1
ago in three minutes, eight sec
onds. Ben wasn't feeling so well,
which accounts for the "had"
time. I

| As for any designs on the mile
! record, Big Ben will have plenty
with which to occupy his time
following the 1.C.4-A. meet, what
| with running the 400- and 800-
meter runs in the Olympic trials,
j and probably both of those
events and a relay or so at Los
Angeles.
BUT IT is not at all unlikely that
j the record books may some day in
| elude a mark of 4:08 for the mile
| run following the name of Ben East
! man. After watching him break first
I the quarter-mile record and then
the half-mile mark, many people
| immediately jumped to the conclu
t sion that the mile would be next.
And strange as it may seem, it
really may, but not this year. None
! other than Bill Ellington, acting
1 chief of Stanford's track affairs, is
! authority for that statement.
"I shouldn't be at all surprised,"
Ellington said yesterday, "if Ben
could get down to 4:08 or even less
i with a couple of weeks' practice.
1 Naturally he won't try it this year."
Maybe he will next year. If ho
! does, it looks as if there is a chance
j to break the U.S.C. jinx next year.
| How? By having Eastman run the
j 220, 440, 800, and mile, and of course
I the relay.

that Eastman ran the MILE the j
other night in practice in four min- j
utes and eight seconds. Not only i
that, but he reports that Eastman ,
' will attempt to break the world's

IT WOULD seem, however,

stumbled onto Mr. Reliable
Source when the old man was
in a very low condition because
of putting too much yeast in the
last batch, or something.
