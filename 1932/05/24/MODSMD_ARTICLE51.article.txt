# MAL MacNAUGHTON OPPOSES SEAVER IN FINAL GOLF ROUND
## 
### 
Charlie Sever will play Mai Mac-
Naughton in the finals of the Uni
versity golf tournament this Satur
day morning over a 36-hole route.
The two men advanced to the
finals with victories last Saturday,
Seaver winning over Gene Brown 8
and 7 and MacNaughton downing
Bud Eichelberger 6 and 5 in matches
that were never in doubt from the
very outset.
Although Eichelberger was de
cidedly off his best game, it is doubt
ful if, even playing his average
round, he could have checked the
MacNaughton that beat him Satur
day. Mai went the first eighteen in
74 and started the outgoing nine of
his second round in 36, one over par.
Gene Brown had a 76 on his morn
ing round, but it still left him con
siderably behind Seaver who scored
a 72 on the first 18 and won the
match on the 30th green.
