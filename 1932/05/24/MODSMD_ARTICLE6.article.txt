HOPEWELL, N.J., May 23. (/Pjâ€”
A $25,000 reward loomed ahead of
the man-hunters engaged in pursu
ing the Lindbergh baby killers to
night as they opened up new chan
nels of inquiry by mail.
At nearby Trenton leaders of the
state legislature, which reconvened
during the day, cleared the way for
passage of a bill empowering Gov
ernor A. Harry Moore to order a
reward. The governor was prepared
to act immediately.
"We think," said the governoi-,
"and hope the reward may cause
someone who knows something to
squeal."
Traveling at a high rate of speed,
Dr. John F. Condon left his New
York home in the morning and was
driven to the summer home of a
friend at Beckct, Mass., where he
said he planned to fish.
The District Attorney of the
Bronx who has been conducting a
grand jury inquiry into the "Jafsie"
activities said the editor of a news
paper in which Dr. Conlon inserted
advertisements bearing the unusual
signature would be called as a wit
ness. He also spoke of another pos
sible witness whose name was with
held.
