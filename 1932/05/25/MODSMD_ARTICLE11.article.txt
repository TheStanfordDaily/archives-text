## Walter Laughs Off Attack As Communists Leave 
### 
j __
Charles of '"liar" and misrepre-
I sentation, hurled by a woman com
j munist supporter in the audience,
j climaxed the lecture on Soviet Rus-
I sia given hei'e last night by Ellery
I Walter, political observer and news
j paper man.
Rushing down the aisle at the
I conclusion of the talk, the woman
j shook a threatening finger at Wal
ter and exclaimed, "You're a con
temptible young liar. You're not
oven a newspaper correspondent."
! Mingled hisses and cheers greeted
j this attack as Soviet sympathizers
rallied to the side of the disturber
while the majority of the audience
stood by to see the fun.
Walter laughed off the attack and
the excitement subsided when his
heckler left the hall surrounded by
a coterie of friends. Previously dur
ing the course of the lecture the
speaker had been interrupted by a
burst of hisses and applause when
he declared that 90 per cent of
American communists are aliens
who should be deported.
Walter, a self-styled radical, who
went "around the world on one leg,"
described his observations of the
mass of Russians under Soviet rule.
"You can't prophesy about Rus
sia,' he said, but since the founda
tion of Russia is the peasant class,
he believes that it will be impos- j
sible to industrialize Russia because I
of the constant fear of Soviet leaders !
of making mistakes, the lack of j
skilled laborers, lack of co-opera- I
tion with foreign technicians, and j
of standard equipment, executives, .
steady income, and the practice he
terms "subtle sabotage."
Walter, who claims he went to |
Russia with Red tendencies, says!
he believes that America has noth- |
ing to learn from that country, that '
American problems should be set- j
tied in American ways. The danger I
in America, he said, is not in per- ;
mitting the radical American group
from expressing its opinions, but in j
allowing foreigners who condemn '
American principles to remain in I
the country.
