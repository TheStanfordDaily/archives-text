# OIL HEAD SPEAKS TO BUSINESS CLUB ON SHARKEY BILL
## 
### 
Speaking on the present problems
!of the oil industry, L. F. Beyer,
I executive vice-president of the As
j sociated Oil Company in San Fran
cisco, addressed the Business Club
| last night at a dinner in the Union.
Beyer summarized the Sharkey
| Bill as "attempting to give legal
i control to what has been going on
' m practice for several years—cur
; tailment of oil production. The sel
fish interest of individual producers
prompt them to pump more than
is needed and therefore restriction
is needed."
California is producing 500,000
barrels of crude oil a day, more
than is really necessary. Most of the
oil produced in California is ob
tained at a great depth and at a
greater expense than in the Middle
west where it is found closer to the
surface.
The future development of the oil
industry depends on how much
there is left in the ground. There
has been more intense exploitation
in the United States than in any
other country, due largely to the
fact that there are so many more j
automobiles in the United States to |
use gasoline.
