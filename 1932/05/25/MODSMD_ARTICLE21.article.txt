### 
WASHINGTON, May 24. (A 3 )— The
Senate decisively shut the door of i I
the billion dollar revenue bill to
night to further tariff revision by 1
rejecting the export debenture farm j
relief plan. ; 1
Senator Norris (R., Neb.) offered '<■
the debenture amendment after pro- 1
testing against the oil, coal, copper i 1
and lumber import taxes voted by j 1
the Senate in the tax bill, but his : 1
counter tarifT move lost, 46 to 33. j J
Senator Robinson of Arkansas,
the Democratic leader, helped de-j '
feat the attempt by warning that i
the vital budget balancing bill faced 1 '
indefinite delay and perhaps might j J
even force a veto by the tariff items.
Not Test Of Issue j
The roll call was not a test on the i
farm relief issue as a result. Robin- j %
son himself has supported the ex- j
port debenture relief proposal in j
the past.
The agricultural bloc was prom
ised by Chairman McNary of the
Agriculture Committee lhat a vote ,
would be had this session on the j
pending combination

by offering a general levy of 1 3-4 (
per cent on sales, exempting food,
clothing, agricultural necessities and v
publications.
The revenue bill, after ten days of (
grinding debate, is still in the form ; ,

nance Committee.
