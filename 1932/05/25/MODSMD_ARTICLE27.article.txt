Willi the waning of spring comics llic blooming of pro
inolioMS, and so today tlie Daily extends its heartiest to an
other generation of newshawks, each of whom lias taken
another step nearer the coveted goal.
After four months of toiling nobly to fill the editorial
column while Chief Sullivan garnered the plaudits, Jack
Jerncgan and Stewart Crawford have been named candi
dates for the editorship of Volume K2. The staff will choose
between them at next Tuesday's election.
The thankless task of slaving as associate editor under
the new head man falls to Fritz Coodwin and Frank Lloyd,
after long servitude in the night editor's slot. The feminine
element on Volume <S2's editorial board will be supplied by
1 'cits Hawkins, yesterday named women's editor.
Bob Wade, erstwhile copy editor and sports writer of
parts, becomes sports editor, with the doubtful privilege
of filling the slants column from day to day. The free ticket
Iranchise passes to the hands of that eminent critic and
Thespian, Jimmy Sandoe, who will dish the dirt about Paly
movies and San Francisco productions under the reviewer's
standard.
Five new night editors will handle the job of putting the
Daily to bed each night. The fortunate quintet consists of
Elizabeth llcwit, Helen Forsyth, Dick Van Wagcnen, Joe
l-.ndert and Don Douglass. The slashing and editing of the
voluminous Associated Press report will be supervised bv
Mill Myers, who abandons the scribbling of polo news for
his new task. Assisting him will be Hob Jones, new A.P.
copy editor.
Seven former reporters lake the lirsl step to fame and
fortune, a job on the copy desk. They are Mary Delia Cal
lahan, Frances, Johnson, Robert Mvnard, James Radeon-
Maurice Rapf, and Paul Zulch.
Meanwhile, the incumbent editor breathes a faint sigh
of relief. The end of toil and travail looms sharply, and
with these congratulations to the lucky group, he breathes
also a faint prayer for their guidance.
