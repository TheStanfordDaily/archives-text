The wisdom of election of yell leader by tlie entire stu
dent body was questioned considerably by numerous vot
ers at yesterday's elections, primarily because so many of
them were unable to remember, simply by reading the
names on the ballot, which of the two candidates had been
the better last autumn.
Some manner of appointment for this post was even
siloes ted, so lacking were voters in bases for selection.
This, while it might or might not work an improvement,
appears somewhat irrelevant in the 1 i 14ht of the obvious
solution.
Why not elect, as at present, by a vote of the student
body, but hold the election soon after the termination of
football season, when voters will have in mind more recent
impressions of the candidates and their respective abilities?
