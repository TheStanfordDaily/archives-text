# WHERE UNIVERSITIES MUST LEAD
## 
### 
Again, with opening of committee hearings in congress
last week, the question of birth control has arisen from its
temporary grave to be spread over front pages of news
papers, sensationalized, misinterpreted, misunderstood,
and finally laid to rest, the victim of ;in unenlightened pub
lic. Those proposing bills to permit dissemination of birth
control information by physicians will again be denounced
as rank, immoral radicals.
Presenting the multitude of facts which have led emi
nent students of the human race throughout the world to
recognize the sore need for birth control is out of the ques
tion. Sutlice it to cite one truth, elementary in any study
of sociology, that the average family among the ignorant,
lower element of the wage earning class is something over
eight, while that among Harvard graduates falls short of
two.
This new effort in congress will be defeated, as will the
next one, and many, many more. Only the long, bitter
struggle that proceeds the achievement of any progressive
step will finally remove a ban that is so regarding improve
ment of the human race.
Primarily, it will he a fight against long-nosed, dogmatic
"moralists" of the variety of Dr. Howard Kelly, professor
emeritus of Johns Hopkins ( Diversity, who said last week
before the house committee that birth control information
would "pollute life ;it its very source." When they are
silenced, the problem of educating the public will remain.
licniain for whom? Obviously, for universities. It is a
job to be accomplished through centers of liberal thought,
;i fight to be led by college men.
