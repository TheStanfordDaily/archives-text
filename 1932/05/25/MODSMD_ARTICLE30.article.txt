# BULL SESSION
## ACROSS THE BROAD ATLANTIC 
### 
From the arms of American re- ]
porters to the arms of European re- j
porters lias become so set a formula
that we were indeed surprised to
find that anybody else would in- '
dulge in its threadbare procedure.
Sister Amelia Putnam i.s the most,
recent of those who have jumped
off the front pages—only to return
to the headlines some 20 hours later
as the first woman to span the At
lantic solo.
The dauntless aviatrix meant to
land 'midst the enthusiastic, roman
tic, Latin population of Paris who
would have gone near-crazy at the
brave little woman. Weather inter- ;
vened and a lonely farmhouse in 1
Ireland had to replace the scream
ing thousands.
Everybody knows why people fly
or attempt to fly the cruel desola- |
tion of the Atlantic. The "life
stories," photos, and vaudeville con
tracts prepared in advance offer not
mute but screaming evidence of the
motive. Of course in this dualistic
world—where we act selfishly and
rationalize this into u social benefit
—no one would admit flying the
Atlantic for the personal publicity
involved. No, the jump from Grace j
Harbor to Le Bourget must be at- 1
tempted for the advance of avia
tion.
To advance anything is worth- i
while in this promoting world. Even ,
Capone is given some praise for ad- ;
vancing bootleg kfeer—from precari- !
ous peddling to a recognized civic I
institution. To advance aviation is i
not only worthwhile but noble. Avi
ation which will speed medicine to ,
dying people—which will annihilate ;

| time—which will make war more
1 and more like Ilell—which will carry
postcards from Bingo's Lodge in
Minnesota to Long Beach in half
, the time. Aviation is wonderful—it
is progress—it is science. Long live
science and progress!
But is aviation really aided by
having people drop out of sight un
der the cold waves of the briny
deep? Is it aided when a few people
; —by the grace of God and un
clogged oil lines—do make a suc
i cessful journey? As far as the pub
licity goes, aviation gets plenty.
; People do not become air-minded
! by crazy stunts —by hopping some
t ocean —or looping 67% times with
out taking a breath or blinking an
eyelash. The emphasis in aviation
! should be on its sane-ness; its com
i monplaceness and not its breath
taking dangers. If the first automo
biles were 200-mile-per-hour racers,
there wouldn't be so many Fords to
crack up on the highway today.
The experiences of long-distance
Hying can be perfected over land
| areas. The value of water-flying can
be learned along the coast steamer
lanes. The advantages of bad weath
er can be found in other places
! than the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean.
But meanwhile let us not forget
to praise Sister Amelia who proved
that women aviators have no better
sense than their male comrades-in
air. Hail the fearless pioneer of the
women-fly ing-alone-across-the-At
lantic movement. When shall her
glory fade? Oh, the wild fly she
made! Noble Amelia.

deep? Is it aided when a few people

t ocean —or looping 67% times with
out taking a breath or blinking an
eyelash. The emphasis in aviation
! should be on its sane-ness; its com
i monplaceness and not its breath
taking dangers. If the first automo
biles were 200-mile-per-hour racers,
there wouldn't be so many Fords to
crack up on the highway today.
The experiences of long-distance
Hying can be perfected over land

be learned along the coast steamer
lanes. The advantages of bad weath

Ocean.
But meanwhile let us not forget
to praise Sister Amelia who proved
that women aviators have no better
sense than their male comrades-in
air. Hail the fearless pioneer of the
women-fly ing-alone-across-the-At
lantic movement. When shall her
glory fade? Oh, the wild fly she
made! Noble Amelia.

From the arms of American re- ]
porters to the arms of European re- j
porters lias become so set a formula
that we were indeed surprised to
find that anybody else would in- '
dulge in its threadbare procedure.
Sister Amelia Putnam i.s the most,
recent of those who have jumped
off the front pages—only to return
to the headlines some 20 hours later
as the first woman to span the At
lantic solo.
The dauntless aviatrix meant to
land 'midst the enthusiastic, roman
tic, Latin population of Paris who
would have gone near-crazy at the
brave little woman. Weather inter- ;
vened and a lonely farmhouse in 1
Ireland had to replace the scream
ing thousands.
Everybody knows why people fly
or attempt to fly the cruel desola- |
tion of the Atlantic. The "life
stories," photos, and vaudeville con
tracts prepared in advance offer not
mute but screaming evidence of the
motive. Of course in this dualistic
world—where we act selfishly and
rationalize this into u social benefit
—no one would admit flying the
Atlantic for the personal publicity
involved. No, the jump from Grace j
Harbor to Le Bourget must be at- 1
tempted for the advance of avia
tion.
To advance anything is worth- i
while in this promoting world. Even ,
Capone is given some praise for ad- ;
vancing bootleg kfeer—from precari- !
ous peddling to a recognized civic I
institution. To advance aviation is i
not only worthwhile but noble. Avi
ation which will speed medicine to ,
dying people—which will annihilate ;

| time—which will make war more
1 and more like Ilell—which will carry
postcards from Bingo's Lodge in
Minnesota to Long Beach in half
, the time. Aviation is wonderful—it
is progress—it is science. Long live
science and progress!

having people drop out of sight un
