OK, America! We can fairly smell
J the air of freedom and democracy,
perched out here in the middle of
New York harbor, waiting for
heaven knows what, but neverthe
less waiting.
The government lias put a
definite kink in our plans, be
cause just as we hove into sight
of the dear old N.Y. skyline,
someone nabbed us as a "ques
tionable-looking immigrant," and
since they don't understand our
free Western accent here East
of the Alleghenys, we're in a
fine kettle of old fish.
It certainly is embarrassing, be
cause we were all fixed up to give
the Great Metropolis a treat by
showing them just what a Steenford
gentleman looks like before he's left
it all behind and forgotten the rest
of his poker debts.
There we were, looking very non
chalant, leaning on the rail, when a
guy with a funny-looking cap came
up to us and said something for
eign (a feeble guess at our nation
ality, evidently;, but the idea was
that we were to follow him. Think
ing that he was a reporter wanting
our picture for the first page of The
Times, or something, we followed
graciously—and here we are!
When he put us ofl' into a
funny little tug-boat, we sort of
wondered, but thought it might
be the thing the Hoovers use
for a yacht, now that they've
renounced the Mayflower. The
other passengers looked kind of
funny and worried; but we were
sure it was O.K. because there
was a little cactus plant up on
the prow, and we thought, "Ha!
The secret Stanford insignia!"
But. then they started to talk
about shipping us all back to wher
ever we came from, post-haste, and
we decided something was radically

| wrong. When we finally explained
their error to them, they were so
i mad that they just put us off here
jat the Liberty Goddess' feet, and
here we remain.
A few minutes after all this
happened, though, a plane Hew
low over our head and let a
man down on a rope. And there
was old campus-funny-man Joe
Thompson, the big-shot of Col
litch Humour, to welcome us
with open arms. He smashed
, our souvenir Japanese parasol,
in landing, but Joe is worth even
that.
He explained that he knew we
were bound to do something decid
j edly unconventional (which was a
'swell compliment, coming from Joe),

j so had come out to cruise around j
I and see if the sea-gulls and sharks :
1 were gathering around any par-1
' ticular spot. Yes sir, America is a
; great country.
And here we are. waiting to
he rescued, with your old friend
Thompson and a couple of gulls
for company. So far. Joe hasn't
gotten much of our attention.
