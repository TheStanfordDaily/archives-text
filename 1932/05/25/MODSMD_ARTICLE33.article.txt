i PIETRO RUESCIA'S ORCHESTRA.
Pietro Brescia's ten-piece band!
| did one of the world's hardest things
Monday night, and did it well;
i namely, to play unheralded, un-
I ballyhooed, and unknown, from a
i cold stage to a college audience. In \
the first place, the orchestra is not
j a stage band, and secondly, Mon
j day night's appearance was their
j debut as an organized group. Never- j
j tholess, the audience was assured i
| after several numbers that the band
| was playing refll music and that it i
1 had a decided steady syncopation.
The program opened with "Amer- |
|ican Fantasy," a number which
I hinted strongly at the basic idea of ;
j Brescia's music which is to tint the
) early jazz spirit with symphonic
j coloring, making the orchestration
j a pattern of gradual swells and i
I carefully blended instruments. The j
S most appreciated number of the 1

| presentation was "Bolero," which
I more markedly exemplified Brescia's
j new principle of dance music.
The personnel is made up of real
musicians with versatile talents, so
versatile that the organization car
ries with it forty band pieces. Out
standing among the members is the
"little man in the tin shop'' who
i from an extensive variety of gadgets
from a nextensive variety of gadgets
which surround him. He was for
merly with the Marx Brothers. For
i a decided contrast in sources, let us
) mention the little man with big
ideas who plays the bass viol. He
used to be a member of the S.F.
j Symphony.
You can judge this orchestra for
1 yourself tonight, tomorrow night,
and Friday night at the Women's
| Clubhouse in Palo Alto. —E.E.H.
OF TISF.E I SING—By George S.
Kaufman and Morric Ryskind.
Lyrics by Ira Hcrshwin. Alfred A.
Knopf. 19.'>2. (At Gordon Straw -
bridge's.)
Certainly worthy of the Pulitzer
i Prize, this musical comedy, even in
book form, skips satirically along
sticking its tongue out at the tradi
| tionally austere institutions of these
United States. There have been a
few feeble objections to its wryly
keen humor—one by Bishop James
Cannon being typical and idiotic.
But it continues, unhampered, on its

lengthy way.
George Jean Nathan contributes I
an enthusiastic introduction to this j
edition with additional comments j
upon sweetness and light and the j
musical comedy stage of this cen- ;
tury.
The piece is witty, astute satire, i
neither severe nor distasteful. On '
the stage it must be riotous and j
tellingly keen. The presidential ■
platform of Love, Alexander Throt- j
tlebottom's painfully unrecognized '
efforts at self-assertion, the Sena- 1
torial dignity, committees—every- j
thing is observed keenly.
Without attempting to moralize j
or reform, the collaborators who !
produced "Of Thee I Sing" have j
been at once amusing and—in their j
very easy ridicule—have been criti
cal.
Again hope is expressed that a
competent company will be con- j
jured up or over that the Coast may !
see it to best, advantage. —J.S.S. j
