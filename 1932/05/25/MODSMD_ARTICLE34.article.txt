After five years of residence in
this institution, known far and wide
for its high standing of education, |
and supposedly peopled by the
"upper ten per cent," the voting,
system in vogue here has finally |
gotten under my skin. So I am tak- |
ing the liberty of criticizing this sys- i
tem, though I realize that such ac- {
lion is tantamount to inviting sar- j
casm and possible ostracism.
In this institution we students
study subjects of all types, finding '
their weak points and finding reme- '
dies for them. Among these sub
jects is our national governmental ;
system, run in the same way ours !
is here at .school. Students of it find '
that a good share of the voting |
populace votes by party ticket and
not for the man it thinks best. This I
system is admitted to be not good
when considering the benefit to the I
country as a whole and should be
relegated to the scrap heap of dead j
political ideas. Under such a voting :
system there is never any assurance
that the best man will get the office,
and if he does so it's mostly happen- |
stance. However, due to the bulk ;
of our national population and the j
difficulty of gaining access to the |

individual, it would be very diffi
cult to put on an efficient campaign
jto efface these erroneous ideas on
how to vote from the mind of the
people. So they are left alone.
Here at Stanford, however, some-
I thing could be, can be, and ought to
i be done about it. We have a small
| enough student body so that a little
j thorough and effective campaigning,
j carried over a series of elections,
: could inaugurate a system of real
' democratic voting, in which each
! person votes for the officer whom
he thinks to be the best man. We
| are democratic in everything else
1 we do here (except for some of the
j sororities); so why be otherwise in
■ a very important part of our student
• life?
Why should hall men vote for hall
I men every time if they know very
J well that a Row man who is running
! would be better in office, and vice
| versa? Why should political cliques,
: having some special interest at
heart, be able to put into effect the
; desire of an actual minority by act
j ing on tlie habits and traditions of
i the school and getting men to vote
I as hiil 1 or row men and not as in
i telligent students. It's no excuse to
say, "Why shouldn't we do so? Cal
J votes that way. U.S.C. votes that
j way. Our national government is
j run that way." These are not ex
' cuses, but are evidences of the same
; rotten system.
We have some good traditions
here and the older of us are be
[ moaning the fact that many of the
] old traditions are passing out. Let's
replace them. Why can't the stu
| dents of Stanford University show
' evidence of their famous intelli
gence and start a new tradition by
which fairness will rule the elec
tions, giving offices to those who de
i serve them, be they Greek or other
; wise? Let's cease voting as a group
' ol sheep and vote as intelligent per
! sons. Everett Baker

jects is our national governmental ;
system, run in the same way ours !
is here at .school. Students of it find '
that a good share of the voting |
populace votes by party ticket and
not for the man it thinks best. This I
system is admitted to be not good
when considering the benefit to the I
country as a whole and should be
relegated to the scrap heap of dead j
political ideas. Under such a voting :
system there is never any assurance
that the best man will get the office,
and if he does so it's mostly happen- |
stance. However, due to the bulk ;
of our national population and the j
difficulty of gaining access to the |

individual, it would be very diffi
cult to put on an efficient campaign
jto efface these erroneous ideas on
how to vote from the mind of the
people. So they are left alone.
Here at Stanford, however, some-
I thing could be, can be, and ought to
i be done about it. We have a small
| enough student body so that a little
j thorough and effective campaigning,
j carried over a series of elections,
: could inaugurate a system of real
' democratic voting, in which each
! person votes for the officer whom
he thinks to be the best man. We
| are democratic in everything else
1 we do here (except for some of the
j sororities); so why be otherwise in
■ a very important part of our student
• life?
Why should hall men vote for hall
I men every time if they know very
J well that a Row man who is running
! would be better in office, and vice
| versa? Why should political cliques,
: having some special interest at
heart, be able to put into effect the
; desire of an actual minority by act
j ing on tlie habits and traditions of
i the school and getting men to vote
I as hiil 1 or row men and not as in
i telligent students. It's no excuse to
say, "Why shouldn't we do so? Cal
J votes that way. U.S.C. votes that
j way. Our national government is
j run that way." These are not ex
' cuses, but are evidences of the same
; rotten system.
We have some good traditions
here and the older of us are be
[ moaning the fact that many of the

' evidence of their famous intelli
gence and start a new tradition by
which fairness will rule the elec
tions, giving offices to those who de
i serve them, be they Greek or other
; wise? Let's cease voting as a group
