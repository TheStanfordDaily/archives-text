ONE THING THAT we hope
will come eventually is tin* ad
mittance to the 1.C.4-A. meet of
some of these middle-western
colleges that turn out such ex
cellent performers.
The 1.C.4-A. buttle is the only j
meet in which you can see most cf
the best collegiate track men at the
same time, and the middlewestern
ers, save for Michigan and Michi- :
gan State, do not have much of a i
show.
For instance, when we troop J
through the gates of Edwards Field ;
—well, anyhow, when we watch 1
this meet —we should like to see'
Messers Halstead and Callahan pit
ted against Indiana's Brocksmith, ]
who has run 4:12 4-5 in the mile and ;
y.13 in the two-mile in the same [
afternoon.
We should also like to see
Saling and Keller topping the
hurdles in company with that
surprising gang from the Sunny
South, Payne, Bills, Welsh,
Carls, and Paul. These men ap
proach record time at every
start, and only last week Keller
covered the high hurdle course
in 14 flat, two-tenths of a sec
ond under the existing world
mark of 14.2, set by Percy Beard
of the New York A.C. last year.
The only catch is that the Ohio
State athlete had a .'JO-mile
wind at his back, but 14 flat
would be good in a cyclone.
With the addition of the names I
of Hugh Rhea of Nebraska and !
Clarence Munn of Minnesota to the '
lists of shotputters eligible for the j
1.C.4-A.'s, the event could develop
into a three-way battle between
these two men and Nellie Gray for i
the collegiate shotputting champion
ship of the country. But under the j
present system Minnesota and Ne- !
braska can not send teams to the !
Berkeley meet. They haven't been I
invited.
The N.C.A.A. meet is a good meet
is far as the midwestern teams are !
concerned but they don't have the i
competition from the Pacific Coast I
outfits, except for S.'C., and a lot of j
he eastern squads elect to stay '
lome too.
Nevertheless, the 1.C.4-A.'s
this year will offer some high- j
class performances and they will
start the Olympic ball rolling in
northern California.
