The public address system of the
i Amsterdam stadium rudely shat
| tered the typical August fog:
"Hammer Throwâ€”Won by Pat
; rick O'Callaghan of Ireland. A new
| Olympic record."

This was almost an American vic
tory to the many McGraths, McEach
! erns, and Kellys on the United
States squad. Their applause thun
dered appreciatively. O'Callaghan's
! was perhaps the most popular vic
tory of the Ninth Olympiad,
j Four years have passed since
I O'Callaghan's record throw in the
! Amsterdam stadium. Patrick has
j become Dr. Patrick, and as absolute

| a legend as his saintly namesake.
iFor O'Callaghan has added to his
hammer-throwing laurels by win-
I ning eight events at the 1931 Irish
! track championships. He has hur
j tied his massive frame through 100
; yards in 10 seconds, and over a
high jump bar placed at six feet,
j five inches.
But the final endearment to Irish
| hearts came when the good Doctor
j won the heavyweight boxing cham
i pionship of Ireland. O'Callaghan will
captain both track and boxing
! squads at Los Angeles. Pat's boxing
I ability is a little hazy, but he's al
| most certain to once again out
: perform all other hammer-throwers.
O'Callaghan has thrown the ham
j mer a mere 190 feet in practice, and
i almost gets it out 180 or more in
! competition. His teammate, Walsh,
! has tossed the 16-pound ball and
chain 176 feet, a bit more than a
| foot shy of Frank Connor's Ameri
i can record of 177 feet. 10% inches.
England, never a strong-arm
team, has a 160-footer, Noakes, as
i champion. Germany's threat is only
j a minor one. One hundred fifty-five
feet is his best mark.
