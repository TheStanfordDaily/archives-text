# Indian Cindermen Train For P.A.A. Meet June 3
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
Post mortems and the P.A.A. meet
are all that remain of this quarter's
track season. In preparation for the
latter, which will be held in Kezar
Stadium, June 4, the Indians will
work out today and Friday of this
week and the first three days of next
week.
As for the post mortems, they are
mainly concerned with too many
injuries and too much Southern

i California, both-of which struck the i
i Card spikemen and rendered them
I distinctly meek.
The injuries hit the coach and
I the captain first, and from them
| traveled right down the line, in- i
j eluding a man or so in each and
I every event. Les Hables, Ike Rabies, |

; Bill Werder, Bill Miller, Horace j
: Guittard, Paul Aebersold, Dan Mur- '
, phy, Bert DeGroot, George Grey,— J
' that's a pretty fair track team right ,
' there.
As for S.C., they had just too
much. We're too bone-headed to in- :
' sist that Stanford would have had no >
j chance had the team been at its j
: peak when the Trojan meet was run
I off, but in fairness to Cromwell's I
horde, those Trojans have a great I
J track team.
