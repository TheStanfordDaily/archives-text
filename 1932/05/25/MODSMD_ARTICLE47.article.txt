# LAGUNITA TO AID DAIRY IRRIGATION DURING DRAINAGE
## 
### 
Lagunita will soon be no more.
Such was the authentic verdict
from the Corporation Yards which
I is supervising the draining of the
i lake. The water is being run off to
I the dairy for irrigation purposes. It
| will not all be drained off at once
j as it cannot all be used at once.
The water in Lagunita evaporated
much more quickly this year than
usually when the lake has been
full. The reason for this is that very
little rain fell after the heavy storms
in December which filled the lake
and there was therefore nothing to
offset the evaporation process.
Public phones at the University of
I Utah will be removed unless stu
dents cease using slugs instead of
I coins.
