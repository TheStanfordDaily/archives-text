# Millard And Phypers Named To W.A.A. Posts
## 
### 
Jeanne Millard and Ruth Phypers
were appointed hockey and basket
ball managers respectively for the
1932-1933 seasons, at a W.A.A. Board
meeting last night.
The appointments were made fol
lowing the policy adopted by the
board that no woman be allowed to
hold more than one W.A.A. position
at one time, resulting in the resig
nations of Ruth Fisher and Louise
Hudson, who had held the manager
ships.
