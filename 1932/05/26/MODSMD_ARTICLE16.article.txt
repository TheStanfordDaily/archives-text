# Concedes Curtis Will Be Indicted On Hoax Charge
## Council Admits Client Will Face Trial As State Speeds Action 
### 
HOPEWELL, N.J., May 25. (/P) —
Speedy Grand Jury action in the
"enormous deception" perpetrated
by John Hughes Curtis, hoax ne
gotiator, was near tonight as nega
tive developments impeded the
progress of the main hunt for the
kidnapers and killers of the Lind
bergh baby.
Prosecutor Hauck was ready to
lay the Curtis case before the
Hunterdon County Grand Jury to
morrow, and W. C. Pender, attorney
for Curtis, conceded in Norfolk, Va.,
there was little doubt his client
would be indicted.
Defense Plans Attack
Any indictment, however, would
not be reported formally until Sat
urday.
On the time of a trial of the
charges of obstructing justice and
furnishing false information the
prosecutor and Pender were in dis
agreement.
Hauck said he hoped to conclude
the case before the end of June, but
Pender asserted preparation of the
defense, including probably a legal
attack on the old statute involved,
would require more time than that.
Identification Faulty
Meantime, Dr. John F. Condon,
the ranson payer, remained in New
England while one of the clues he
supplied police collapsed. "Jafsie"
had picked out a picture as the like
ness of "John," to whom he paid
$50,000 April 2.
Investigation of the subject dis
closed, authorities related, "no pos
sible connection with this case."
