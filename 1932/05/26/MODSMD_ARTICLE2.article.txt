# WOMEN MAKE AS GOOD LAWYERS AS MEN, SAYS McNAB
## 
### 
Cornered after the debate ban
quet last night, John L. McNab, the
man who nominated Hoover in 1928,
wrote down a few observations on
women lawyers.
"Women," said the San Francisco
attorney, "mentally as well as phys
ically, are as well adapted to the
practice of law as men. But they
must have greater courage."
In his after-dinner speech McNab
wondered what the world would do
with all the prospective lawyers
whom he witnessed at the debaters'
annual dinner. In discussing the
situation a young lawyer is faced
with one who has just started his
practice, he said. "Don't be afraid of
making mistakes. The only man who
has not made mistakes is the one
who has not had the chance to."
But McNab thinks the most im
portant thing in law is to know how
to "get the business."
