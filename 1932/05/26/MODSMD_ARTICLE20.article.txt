# University Boasts Only General Press in West
## 
### MARION McELWAIN 
The only general publishing house
west of the Mississippi is located
close to home.
It is the Stanford University
Press, under the authority of the
trustees. The Stanford Press occu
pies a unique position among West
ern university presses as it has ex
tended its service from the neces
sary college printing jobs to general
publishing. It is the only press of
any sort in the West that publishes
a general list of non-fiction.
The Press serves the usual pur
pose of university presses in issuing
books which are worthwhile but do
not have a wide enough market to
recommend them to the commercial
publisher. In addition, because of its

j unique position, it has developed a
small list of trade books as a part
| of its service to Pacific Coast au
! thors.
j Many professors publish the re
j suits of theii* researches here at the
i University. Authors from universi
| ties as remote as Harvard and other
i writers not connected with any uni
! versity have their work published
here also.
Thirteen bopks have been pub
lished in the last six months by the
j Press. "One Hundred Years in Yo
semite" by Carl P. Russell of the
National Park Service is the most
recent publication. It appeared in
April. The Stanford books are pub
lished abroad in Great Britain by
the Oxford University Press.
