NEW YORK, May 25. (/P)â€”Mayor
James J. Walker, in a fiery, spec
tacular appearance as a witness to
day before Samuel Seabury, ac
kowledged realizing with
out investment from a brokerage
account with Paul Block, the pub
lisher, and denied he influenced im
properly the granting of a bus fran
chise.
The tracing of the brokerage
transactions came as the Mayor
completed a full day on the stand
of the Hofstadter legislative com
mittee, which has been engaged in
a sweeping fourteen months' in
vestigation of the municipal govern
ment, with Seabury as counsel.
Mobs Cheer "Jimmy"
When the Mayor arrived in the
morning the whole neighborhood
echoed with the cheer that went up.
All day the streets around the
building were black with men and
women, who stood there for hours
just to get a glimpse of the man
New York's millions call "Jimmy."
Walker said the joint account was
opened without any initial invest
ment, "on Mr. Block's splendid
credit and reputation."
The Mayor said there was no un
derstanding as to how withdrawals
were to be made, but "a method was
developed."
Withdrawals Listed
A list of the withdrawals was en
tered in evidence. It showed the
drawings of sums ranging from
$7500 to $35,027.75.
A letter introduced from Max
Block to Paul Block explained the
history of the account, said an in
come tax agent had advised Paul
Block it was unwise to have such
an account with the Mayor and
suggested the name of the account
be changed.
"None of the money from the ac
j count was deposited at a bank,"
Walker explained, "but it was kept
in a safe at home available for Mrs.
Walker and myself."
