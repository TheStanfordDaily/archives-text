# HALL MEN STAGE PERIODIC BRAWL, AQUA PURA FIGHT
## 
### 
Threatening momentarily to be
come a good-sized riot, a Breakers-
Toro water fight last night spread
until it included men from Toyon,
Encina, and virtually all the eating
clubs.
Starting as one of the periodic
rows of the sort, the rumpus had
assumed big proportions when the
shouts of freshmen lined up along
the east side of Encina Commons
attracted the attention of the club
men, who charged the first-year
men with buckets, cans, and pitch
ers of water.
The affair broke up after it had
degenerated into a car-drenching,
catch-as-catch-can rat race.
