## Campus Police Baffled By Disappearances

Who is Stanford's Ghost Girl?
Who is the beauty Stanford men
find sitting at the foot of their bed
at 3 o'clock in the morning—never
seen before nor after by the roughs
whose rooms she has graced?
Twice on Row and once in a dorm
within the last year, men have
awakened to find a girl, eyes moist
and attired in evening dress, gazing
at them.
This much is known, the gild is
tall and dark. And that once she
has appeared, the man never sees
her again. She is not a campus girl,
all are agreed on that. But she is
young and strikingly moulded.
Encina Incident
Three weeks ago she appeared in
Encina basement. The man, promi
nent in campus dramatics, awoke
and saw her studying him.
Aware of the difficulties if he
should be discovered in his mid
night "rendezvous," the host re
quested that his visitor leave, or
failing that to at least pull down
the custain. The girl began to cry.
Wrapping himself in a blanket,
the student arose and turned to
lower the curtain. The mystery girl
got up and left the room.
A few minutes later the curious
rough, regretting his hasty action,
decided to follow her. But the in
terval was too long and the girl
had left the hall.
Campus Rules
Campus customs prohibit girls
from visiting dormitories at any
time except on Sunday and on
dance nights.
She has appeared at least twice
at Stanford fraternity houses, and
other instances are rumored.
The stories corroborate each
other. Once a group of Row men
found her on the sleeping porch.
She offered no explanation but in
stead began crying.
She slipped from the house. The
men insist that the girl was NOT a
campus woman, and that they have
not seen her since.
At another time the men notified
police who held the theory that the
r\r\ r-vorfo
girl was insane. Two days later a
woman was picked up in San Ma
teo answering to the general de
scription of Stanford's mystery
woman. She told police she did not
know what her name was and could
not say where she came from.
However, the Encina episode,
which followed the incident, shat
tered that theory.
Gordon Davis, campus officer,
told reporters last night that he had
recently received word from Colo
rado that a former Stanford student
had recognized the "mystery girl"
there.
Fred Frehe, another campus of
ficer, recalled a similar incident oc
curring four years ago.
The identity of Stanford's Ghost
Girl remains shrouded in mystery.
She is fast becoming a central figure
in Stanford folklore.
In Russia divorces are granted
through a divorce bureau at the cost
of approximately one dollar upon the
declaration of dissatisfaction of
either party.

Who is Stanford's Ghost Girl?
Who is the beauty Stanford men
find sitting at the foot of their bed
at 3 o'clock in the morning—never
seen before nor after by the roughs
whose rooms she has graced?
Twice on Row and once in a dorm
within the last year, men have
awakened to find a girl, eyes moist
and attired in evening dress, gazing
at them.
This much is known, the gild is
tall and dark. And that once she
has appeared, the man never sees
her again. She is not a campus girl,
all are agreed on that. But she is
young and strikingly moulded.
Encina Incident
Three weeks ago she appeared in
Encina basement. The man, promi
nent in campus dramatics, awoke
and saw her studying him.
Aware of the difficulties if he
should be discovered in his mid
night "rendezvous," the host re
quested that his visitor leave, or
failing that to at least pull down
the custain. The girl began to cry.
Wrapping himself in a blanket,
the student arose and turned to
lower the curtain. The mystery girl
got up and left the room.
A few minutes later the curious
rough, regretting his hasty action,
decided to follow her. But the in
terval was too long and the girl
had left the hall.
Campus Rules
Campus customs prohibit girls
from visiting dormitories at any
time except on Sunday and on
dance nights.
She has appeared at least twice
at Stanford fraternity houses, and
other instances are rumored.
