# Party Leaders Rally To Save Joint Tax Bill
## Senator Harrison Demands Immediate Showdown on Sales Tax as Reed Asserts Passage of Bill Will Stop Drain on American Gold 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 25. {IP)— In the face of threatened collapse of the
coalition which so far has maintained the compromise tax bill intact
on its course through the Senate, joined tonight in powerful non
partisan pleas for action. Senator Harrison of Mississippi, a Democratic
leader on revenue legislation, joined with Reed of Pennsylvania, a Re
publican spokesman, in the appeal. Harrison called for an immediate

showdown on the sales tax. Reed
said the financial security of the
country was at stake.
Claims Run On Gold
They sprang into action when the
Senate deserted the rates written
by the Finance Committee on pas
senger automobiles, thereby elimi
nating $14,000,000 of estimated reve
nue from the bill.
Reed said the world was making
a run on American gold.
"We lost $127,000,000 in expoi'ted
gold last week," he said, adding:
"That process of withdrawal of
gold will stop the minute the world
knows that we here in this room
have the courage to raise taxes and
balance the budget. We don't want
to put on any new taxes. It is a
question of the presentation of the
soundness of the country and that
must come ahead of any particular
business."
Auto Tax Voted
The Senate then voted to retain
the three per cent tax on passenger
automobiles. This tax was put in
the bill by the House and was es
timated to be capable of raising
$44,000,000. The Senate then ac
cepted the increase in the automo
bile accessories tax from one to two
per cent provided in the compro
mise revenue bill.
A little earlier, the Senate had
again injected a proposal to legalize
and tax 2.75 per cent beer by a 55
to 26 vote. It also rejected a number
of other proposed amendments.
