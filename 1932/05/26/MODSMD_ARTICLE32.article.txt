### 
LONDON, May 25. (/P)â€”Sir John
Simon, foreign secretary, told the
House of Commons today a formal
agreement to repay in ten equal
annuities the British war debts of
$160,000,000 which were suspended
by the Hoover Moratorium would
be signed soon at Washington.
He described it as a "purely for
mal step" to give legal effect to. the
moratorium, involving no decision
on any question of principle. Thus
the British recognition of America's
contention that war debts and repa
rations are separate problems re
mained unaffected.
The foreign secretary said he did
not expect the agreement to have
any effect on the conference which
will attempt to settle the reparation
and war debts problems at Lau
sanne, Switzerland, next month.
