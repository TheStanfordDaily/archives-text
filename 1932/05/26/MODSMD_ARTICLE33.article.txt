# SENATOR FORWARDS FEDERAL MEASURES TO END GANG RULE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 25.
Federal powers to regulate inter
state commerce would be applied to
"aid the states in the suppression of
racketeering and gangster activi
ties," under a bill introduced today
by Senator Dill (D., Wash.)
The measure, similar to that sub
mitted in the house by Representa
tive Woodruff (R., Mich.), would
provide heavy penalties for those
who should go, persuade or force
others to go across state lines to
commit felonies.
The penalties would range from
life imprisonment if murder should
be committed to 25 years in prison
and a $25,000 fine.
