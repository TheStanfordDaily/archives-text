Forty unfavorable votes blocked the necessary two
thirds majority to enact the constitutional amendment pro
viding for an appointive Men's Council.
Forty voters, misled by the success of the present Coun
cil and blind to the failures of the previous Councils, de
feated a move that would change a far from perfect system.
It is true that having the members of the Men's Council
appointed by the president of the student body, the grad
uate member of Ex Committee and the chairman of the
Council might be no improvement, it might even work to a
disadvantage. On the other hand it might wipe out the
well-known, existing defects in the present Council system.
It is impossible to ascertain the results of the appointive
plan without giving it a try. If it failed, a new arrangement
could be substituted. Merely because a new plan is insti
tuted, it does not follow that the plan, good or bad, must be
maintained. Unless a system is admittedly perfect, as the
workings of the present Honor Code are not, it should be
corrected and no correction can be accomplished without
change.
The arguments against the appointive Council are theo
retical and uncertain. The proposed plan was not danger
ous and it is lamentable that the students were not far
sighted enough to give it a try.
