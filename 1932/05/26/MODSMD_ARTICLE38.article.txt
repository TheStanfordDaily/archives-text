# A 						GAME FOR MOTORISTS
## 
### 
The average student on the Farm is not particularly
versed in die higher technique of traffic control, lie is,
however, observant enough to wonder how the combined
traffic "brains" of Stanford and Palo Alto have succeeded,
during one year of feverish activity, in erecting a motorist
maze so completely effective as the one that now stands at
the intersection of University drive and El Camino Real.
From a peaceful, ordinary intersection of the everyday
sort that the average motorist could negotiate without un
due effort or entertainment, this spot has been doctored by
the concentrated application of scientific engineering until,
in twelve short months, it has become an exciting puzzle
which even motorists of the truck driving variety cannot
approach without a thrill.
Mow completely the public has been fooled by those
hidden stop and go signals must have afforded the "ex
perts" many a hearty laugh. And imagine the fun and
frolic awaiting the Big Game migration next autumn when
it attempts to manipulate around that large island now be
ing constructed on the Stanford side of the intersection.
However, there are those who fail to appreciate the
humor of the situation, and are attempting to put a damper
on the game. State officers have refused to arrest highway
motorists who fail to observe and obey the obscure red
stop light. And Gordon Davis, campus cop, has expressed
the belief that direction of traffic around that new. island
will be virtually impossible.
Rut, happily, these joykills will probably be silenced
by a joint committee of experts from Stanford and Palo
Alto, that the frolicking may continue unconfined.
