# DEPRESSION HITS FOOTBALL
## 
### 
As forecast by the various graduate managers in col
leges on the Coast, the 1932 football season presents a strik
ing contrast to seasons of four and five years ago. Back in
1927 football was booming, crowds begging to see the im
portant games at any price. Colleges throughout the coun
try were hard pressed to take care of the fans and launched
huge stadium building programs. Coaches commanded
steadily mounting salaries.
Rut now, how different the scene! Rapidly falling at
tendance at all contests, even some of the biggest, has
driven gridiron financial chiefs to make drastic cuts in the
price of tickets for all games on the California and Stan
ford schedules, and if the U.S.C. moguls adopt the recent
proposal of Graduate Manager Arnold Eddy all of the
state's "big three" will be on a depression scale.
It is pretty sad all around, particularly when, as is the
case up at Washington, ambitious athletic programs were
undertaken with the idea that boom receipts would con
tinue. Stanford, however, although hit rather badly, is
much better off than many institutions. We can congratu
late ourselves that sane and sound management has
avoided the necessity for any serious curtailment of athletic
activity or for any personnel slashes.
