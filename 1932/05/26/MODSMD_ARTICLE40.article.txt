### THEY CAN'T SAY NO 
The "500" take infinite pleasure
in proving that the restrictions that
the administration places about
them are silly, Victorian, and un
necessary. But every day, the list
of women who move over to the
rest home for no other reason than
just "generally run down" is damn
ing proof that Stanford women ac
tually cannot take care of them
selves. If there were no social re
strictions, it is not too much to
think that in a few weeks the "run
downers" would monopolize all the
available buildings and, weather
permitting, we could expect cots
lined six deep in the Inner Quad.
If it was excessive study that
drove the "500" from their native
habitat in Roble and on Row to the
rest-home, then most people would
say justifiable lack of control. But
careful investigation shows that
cause No. 1 to 99 inclusive is the
inability of the average co-ed to
refuse a date. Because there are the
present odds between men and
women, the average co-ed receives
more invitations than ever before
! in her life. This sudden deluge is
i intoxicating in its sweetness. The
! poor girl loses any sense of propor
| tion that may have once adhered
; and is lost in the mad swirl; which
swirl usually ends in the rest-home.
But even more important is the
inability of a co-ed to refuse an in
vitation without creating the wrong
I impression on the masculine end of

the telephone line. A woman wants
to say "No". Yet the desire is to
speak the kind of a "no" which
will not cut off future relations.
For a girl to pour out cutting refu
sals with a lavish hand will soon
bring dire results unless the indi
vidual is very unusual and unusual
people are very rare.
Why is it that the co-ed cannot
refuse without making the poor
rough feel that he has been scorned
and his pride has been scourged to
bloody tatters? Simply, because
femininity has completely perverted
the meaning of adjectives and ad
verbs. "Terribly, terribly sorry"
has absolutely lost its significance.
It means less than nothing, A re
fusal prefaced with this inanity
bears no weight. And so in accept
ing an invitation, the perennial
"I'd love to" has equal convincing
j ness. One wonders if the Angel Ga
[ briel upon asking a Stanford co-ed
! about her willingness to visit the
I other regions would not merely
| reply "I'd love to"—with the same
| inflection as that used to signify a
i desire to visit a Paly movie.
!
Because feelings when taken to
| the extreme at every drop of the
j hat or buzz of the telephone mean
nothing, the co-ed must either cut
loose from mankind in toto or ac
cept every reasonable invitation.
The result is a lack of sleep—finally
resulting in that terrible "run
i down" condition—you know what I
j mean, dear—just feel terribly awful.

people are very rare.
Why is it that the co-ed cannot
refuse without making the poor
rough feel that he has been scorned
and his pride has been scourged to
bloody tatters? Simply, because
femininity has completely perverted
the meaning of adjectives and ad
verbs. "Terribly, terribly sorry"
has absolutely lost its significance.
It means less than nothing, A re
fusal prefaced with this inanity
bears no weight. And so in accept
ing an invitation, the perennial
"I'd love to" has equal convincing
j ness. One wonders if the Angel Ga
[ briel upon asking a Stanford co-ed
! about her willingness to visit the
I other regions would not merely
| reply "I'd love to"—with the same
| inflection as that used to signify a
i desire to visit a Paly movie.
!
Because feelings when taken to
| the extreme at every drop of the
j hat or buzz of the telephone mean
nothing, the co-ed must either cut
loose from mankind in toto or ac
cept every reasonable invitation.
The result is a lack of sleep—finally
resulting in that terrible "run
i down" condition—you know what I
j mean, dear—just feel terribly awful.

The "500" take infinite pleasure
in proving that the restrictions that
the administration places about
them are silly, Victorian, and un
necessary. But every day, the list
of women who move over to the
rest home for no other reason than
just "generally run down" is damn
ing proof that Stanford women ac
tually cannot take care of them
selves. If there were no social re
strictions, it is not too much to
think that in a few weeks the "run
downers" would monopolize all the
available buildings and, weather
permitting, we could expect cots
lined six deep in the Inner Quad.
If it was excessive study that
drove the "500" from their native
habitat in Roble and on Row to the
rest-home, then most people would
say justifiable lack of control. But
careful investigation shows that
cause No. 1 to 99 inclusive is the
inability of the average co-ed to
refuse a date. Because there are the
present odds between men and
women, the average co-ed receives
more invitations than ever before
! in her life. This sudden deluge is
i intoxicating in its sweetness. The
! poor girl loses any sense of propor
| tion that may have once adhered
; and is lost in the mad swirl; which
swirl usually ends in the rest-home.
But even more important is the
inability of a co-ed to refuse an in
vitation without creating the wrong
I impression on the masculine end of

the telephone line. A woman wants
to say "No". Yet the desire is to
speak the kind of a "no" which
will not cut off future relations.
For a girl to pour out cutting refu
sals with a lavish hand will soon
bring dire results unless the indi
vidual is very unusual and unusual
people are very rare.
