# CONCERNING MR. LOWE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The letter of Howard Lowe criti

cizing Abe Mellinkofi and his Bull
Session, especially his attitude to
ward the recent Hawaiian affair,
expresses the typical line of thought
usually found only in Hearst's edi
torials and articles in his papers by
the great "headline hunter" Floyd
Gibbons. Just as Gibbons attempts
to arouse Congress to believe that
the Japanese in Hawaii are prob
ably plotting to "bomb the docks
in Pearl Harbor," so does Mr. Lowe
try to see in Abe Mellinkoff's opin
ion that justice was not done by
letting the Massie-Fortescue de
fendants go free, a radical desire
on his part to tear down our time
honored standards, ideals, etc., etc.
It seems that, in the mind of Mr.
Lowe as in the mind of Floyd Gib
bons, everyone who is foreign or
of a different color is either im
moral or dangerous to the United
States and that anyone who stoops
to defend such persons is certainly
a dangerous radical.
Yours sincerely,
Franklin Baker
