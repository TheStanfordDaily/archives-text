WHEN BEN EASTMAN ran the j
half-mile in 1:51.3 early last month j
to clip three-tenths of a second from j
Dr. Otto Peltzer's world record,
most of his friends felt that it was
far from the limits of Ben's capa
bilities in the event.
Lack of experience in judging his
pace for the various divisions of the j
race probably accounts for the fact
that Eastman didn't reduce the mark
by a second or more.
With all the important collegiate
meets out of the way until the
I.C.A.A.A.A. contests at Berkeley in j
July, Blazing Ben will drop his iron
man role and take another crack at
the 880 record.

THE P.A.A. MEET to be held
at Kezar Stadium on Saturday,
June 4, will be the scene of
I Eastman's next record try. He
will run only one race on that
| day, but may break two records
while doing so.
All the P.A.A. events will be
metric distances this year, but
two tapes will be held for East
man to break—at the 800 meter
mark and at the 880 yard dis
tance. The 800 meter record of
1:50.6 seconds is held by Sera
Martin, the sensational French
middle-distance runner. He
chalked it up on July 14, 1928.
There are various and sundry
other records which Eastman
might assault along the way,
but there aren't timers enough
to go around. Among those
which he could probably crack
en route are those for 600 yards,
500 meters, and possibly some of
the shorter distances.

IT WAS IN the P.A.A.A. meet
last year that Eastman ran the 880
for the first time with no other
races ahead of or behind him, set
ting a new meet record of 1:53 in
spite of a raw wind, a wet track,
and numerous water hazzards.
The only thing that could stop
Ben from setting a couple of new
world records this year would be
more of that abdominable weather
for which Kezar is famous. It might
be that the wind velocity would
prevent his marks from being ac
cepted.
Following this meet, Ben will
have no more opportunity for rec
ord-breaking before the Olympic
Games in Los Angeles. In both the
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet and in the Olym
pic trials to be held here he will
again be putting on his iron-man
act.
In the Games themselves, how
ever, the various events which East
man will enter will be scattered far
enough apart to enable him to re
duce world standards for the 400
and 800 meters. —L.M.C.
