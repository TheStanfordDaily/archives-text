consisted of four flights of 120-yard
low hurdles.
El Toro's Relay
However, the leaders came back
to win the four-man mile relay in
3:36.5. This was an exceptionally
close race and was led by Breakers
until Stallings passed Austin in the
third lap. Williams, of the Breakers,
challenged Wright in the last lap,
but the latter finished five yards
ahead. Kappa Sigma was also third
in this race.
The total team standings, follow
ing yesterday's races, are as fol
lows:
El Toro 15
Breakers 14
Kappa Sigma 7
D.K.E.'s 3
Phi Kappa Sigma 2
Union 2 1
4:30 Deadline
Today's races, which will end the
carnival, include a four-man 880
and eight-man relay. The record in
the latter event has already been
established in a former meet at
3:07.1 and will have to be broken
before the cup will change hands.
Kappa Sigma is conceded a very
good chance of copping the shorter
race because of the excellent time
made in, the 440-yard relay.
Gene Mires, intramural manager,
urges that all teams be present at
the Old Oval at 4:30 o'clock so that
competition may start promptly.
