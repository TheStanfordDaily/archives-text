# TANK RECORDS FADE WHEN SENIORS TURN BACK FROSH WOMEN
## 
### 
Women swim records have been
falling thick and fast this year, and
the meet yesterday between the
freshmen and seniors played havoc
with records.
Margery Thomas re-broke her
former 25-yard back stroke record
when she thrashed her way down
the pool in 17 seconds. She appar
ently was not satisfied with that,
so she proceeded to break her own
25-yard crawl record by swimming
the distance in 13.1. Her former
record was 13.2.
The seniors were out to win, and
they certainly did. They took every
first place, and most of the seconds
to win by a score of 53 to 19.
