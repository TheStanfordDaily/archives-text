# Card Discuss Tosser Big Olympic

(Editor's Note: This is the fourteenth of a series of articles on the
coming Olympic Games at Los Angeles.)

Like their sprinting teammates,
American discus-throwers reached
their peak in 1930, when Paul Jes
sup and the late Eric Krenz were
threatening world's records on every
toss. In 1932 the athletic and eco
nomic depressions still continue,
but rumors are flying above the
Stanford Oval that the slump is
nearly over, and that just around
the proverbial corner Bobby Jones,
Indian athlete, is tossing the disci
phenomenal distances.
Competition may prove strong,
however, when Hoffmeister of Ger
many (161 feet, 11 inches), and Noel
and Winter of France, both consist
ent at 155 to 160 feet began tearing
up the long-prepared Olympic Sta
dium turf with their flying platters.
Although Dink Templeton's and
Bill Ellington's courageous varsity

tracksters may receive repeated
drubbings at the hands of Southern
California athletes, the Indian worm
seems due for a very decided turn
ing at the Olympiad. Frank Wykoff,
Bill Graber, and Dick Barber should
be a big aid to American hopes at
Los Angeles, but the point totals of
this triumvirate are likely to be a
'good deal shy of the aggregate piled
up by Stanford's Ben Eastman, Bill
Miller, Nellie Gray, Bobby Jones,
and Here Laborde. Laborde is picked
to place.
