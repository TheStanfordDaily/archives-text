# GIBERSON WILL ENTER IN P.I.A.
## Captain Ike Hables Training For I.C.4-A. Meet 
### 
Pronounced in much improved
physical condition by the team
physician, Ralph Giberson of tl>e
Stanford cinder squad will probably
be able to run in the Pacific Ath
letic Association meet. Giberson has
been incapacitated due to injuries
received in an automobile accident,
and worked out yesterday for the
first time in nearly two weeks.
The return of Giberson gives the
Cards not only another valuable
man, but also the moral advantage
of having a sprinter on the team.
The Indians for several weeks found
themselves unable to enter a single
man in the dashes in any track
meet, yet this was the condition of
the Indians in the California Inter
collegiates.
