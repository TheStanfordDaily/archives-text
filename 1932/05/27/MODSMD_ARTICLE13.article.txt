The sequel to Wednesday's water
I fight between Encina and Toyon
: took place last night.
Although the first battle turned
I out to be nothing more than a car
. washing episode for all roadsters
who passed by the road between the
■ two battle forts, last night's skir
mish was a well-planned campaign. J
\ The only thing to mar a perfect j
j maneuver was the fact that Toyon |
i men seemed disinclined to wage !
j war at first.
