# MANNING TALKS ON ELECTRICITY
## Pilled Assembly Hall Hears "Adventures In Science" 
### 
j Demonstrating everyday applica
| tions of electronics, Ellis L. Man-
I ning, accredited lecturer of the
! General Electric Company, spoke
! last night before an audience that
j crowded the Assembly Hall on "Ad
j ventures in Science."
I Manning described in terms com
j prehensible to the layman the ac- i
i tion of decomposition of radium, il
lustrating his explanation by sound
waves from an elcctric amplifier, in ;
which the noise 01" particles bom- 1
barding the delicate microphone 1
could be heard through a loud
I speaker.
Demonstrates Talkies
The most striking experiment
which Manning performed was a
demonstration of the photo-electric !
cell, such as is used in "talkies," 1
when the vibrations caused by
groovos on a phonograph record
caused fluctuations in the intensity i
of a beam of light shone across the 1
hall into one of the cells, causing 1
music played on the balcony to [
come out of the speaker on the
stage. The experimenter also de
scribed the uses of the little bulb, |
which controls the ventilating ma- !
chinery of the Holland Tunnel in
New York.
Outlining the purpose of research ;
carried on by the General Electric J
Company, he said scientists engaged I
in research at the present time were j
working to fill the dearth of data 1
eauscd by rapid discovering during j
the last few years, by finding new !
material on which to build future |
projects. Electronics, Manning said, j
is the basis of the radio, "talkies," j
and television.
Aid Malaria Fight
The speaker likewise explained
(he discovery that high frequency
oscillations raised blood tempera- j
ture in animals, after the effect had j
been observed on the experiments :
working near the experimental j
tubes. The discovery, he said, has j
led to modern treatment of malaria |
and other diseases cured by heat. \
Illustrating the point, Manning [
popped corn between two jars of
icewater between which currents of 1
high frequency were discharged.
