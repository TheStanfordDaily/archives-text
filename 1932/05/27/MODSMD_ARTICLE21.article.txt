Several Innovations
The '32 edition contains several in
novations, such as a section dedi
! eated to the late Chancellor-Em
eritus David Starr Jordan, written
| by Professor Edward Maslin Hulme,
and a special section covering the
I Olympic Games from an all-Cali
j fornia point of view. Other features
! include a cover made of a material
' that has not been used on any pre
vious book-cover and an animated
j map of campus personalities to be
! used in the advertising section.
The dedicatee is the first non-
Stanford man thus honored, but is
! a man closely connected with the
University and who by his interest
; rather than by his academic pursuits
may be called a Stanford man. His
! identity will not be disclosed until
| the book is issued.
Razz Causes Jitters
Despite the death of men's spring
quarter rushing, the razz section,
| written under the direction of Don
Cameron, conceals little and has al
ready given the jitters to a few
1 student organizations.
Quads will be distributed on June
1. at the old Union. Those holding
! receipts will be given preference for
i the first two or three days. Copies
i may be purchased at the Engineer
