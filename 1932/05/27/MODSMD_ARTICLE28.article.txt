PARIS, May 2(5. (/P)—General John
J. Pershing attacked prohibition as
a source of racketeering today, at
tributing it to the apathy of the
American people.
Passage of the eighteenth amend
ment "was simply the negligence
of the citizen who now sits ifp and
howls," he asserted with unwonted
vigor at a luncheon of the American
Club today.
Scoring those who failed to vote
in the primaries, the General said,
"We arc being governed by a lot of
cheap politicians who put themselves
over on the Americans who arc too
neglectful to go to the polls."
The General's pungently phrased
speech astonished those at the
gathering, evoking roars of approval.
The commander of the American
expeditionary force in the World
war, in paying tribute to Marshal
Louis Franchet d'Esperey, who was
a fellow guest, recalled a lunch with
him west of Soisson in the fall of
1917, saying the Marshall quizzed
him on the possibilities of prohi
bition.
"I said I was a little bit fright
ened that they might be putting it
on us whjle we were gone and it
might be in effect when we got
back," General Pershing said.
Vigorously assailing what he des
cribed as conditions of lawlessness
in the United States, General Persh
ing said ho understood the feeling
with which posses in the old days
strung up outlaws—although he did
not advocate such methods.
