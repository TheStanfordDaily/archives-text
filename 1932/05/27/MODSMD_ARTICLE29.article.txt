# Garner's Relief Bill Okehed By House Bourbons
## Speaker's $2,100,000,000 Measure Provides For Huge Bond Issue for Public Works Program Though Administration Warns of "Shock" 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20. (/P) —Bearing the approval of House Democrats,
the $2.1(10.000,000 Garner relief bill was completed tonight almost
coincidentally with the enunciation of a statement from administration
quarters that a public works program would be a "shock to public con
fidence." The Garner bill carries at $1,047,000,000 public works provision.
It also would provide $100,000,000 to be administered by President Hoover
for direct relief and would add $1,000,000,000 to the capital of the Recon-
instruction Corporation for loans to

| states, cities, counties, individuals,
'and corporations that could furnish
' proper security.
Mills Opposes l'lan
j The expression of administration
I opposition to a public works pro
, gram came from Secretary Mills in
I a statement dealing specifically with
I the program advanced several nights
i ago by former Governor Alfred E.
'Smith of New York.
He said "Public works mean pub
• lie borrowing, an unbalanced bud
j get, and a shock to public confi
j dence."
The Garner measure does not
! specifically provide for a bond issue,
i but Speaker Garner explained to
| his colleagues in a two-hour session
; behind closed doors that the Treas
; ury already was authorized to issue
bonds up to $28,000,000,000 and to
, issue Treasury bills, certificates, and
! notes up to $10,000,000,000.
Gas Tax in Hill
With the public indebtedness
'around $17,000,000,000, Garner said
i the Treasury could finance the pub
-1 lie works program under existing
! authority.
However, the measure provides
for a tax of one-fourth of a cent a
I gallon on gasoline to meet the in
j terest and sinking fund requirc
i monts on the bonds issued by the
j Treasury for the program,
j "Although the bill carries author
, ization for a public works program,
in excess of a billion dollars, search
i as we could we could not find where
, the Federal Government could ex
-1 pend economically and soundly
I more than $435,000,000 in the fiscal
year 1933," Garner said.
"The tax we propose will take
care of the amount needed for in
, terest and the sinking fund to re
tire the bond issue."
