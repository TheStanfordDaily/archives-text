# SEQUOIA SWIMMERS ROUTED IN CHARGE ON POOL AT ROBLE
## 
### 
Ten men got a cold and quick
bath last night. Twenty others got
j cold without the bath.
It all happened about 10:30 o'clock
! last night. Campus Officer George
Burns was just turning the corner
! past the women's pool when a hoard
j of Sequoia men came charging down
the road toward the pool. Ten of
! them saw Burns too late and hit
| the water. The others beat a quick
[ retreat into the darkness.
According to Burns the ten who
! entered the pool "came out faster
| than they went in." The officer
j backed into the shade and waited
I for a reappearance. The offenders
! came sneaking back down the road
j mid were rudely surprised when
I Burns turned his spotlight on them,
j They are thought to be still search -
j ing for their clothes.
This is not the first time such
1 night-time swimming has been
tried. Night before last, according
|to Burns, about seven men and
i three women were surprised at mid
| night ablutions. No names were
taken in either case.
