# CLASS OF 1932 FUND
## 
### 
Hecause of the need of increasing the unrestricted in- 1
come of the I'uiversity, the ('.lass of 11)27 started the class I
tunds to which each student upon graduation could signify !
his intention of contributing a certain amount each year.
I lie amount oi the donation and the 1 year when the pay- i
menls are to start are subject to the desires of the students.
At the first oi next week cards will he sent to all mem
bers of the present graduating class asking for subscrip
tions for the ('.lass of KKJ2 fund. This method of raising
money certainly seems fair when it is remembered that
tuition fees cover only about one-third the cost of a stu
dent's education, the remainder being paid by the tDiver-,
sity through its original endowment.
If tuition fees are raised, it would prevent many stu
dents from attending school. ('.onsequently, it is necessary
to rely upon alumni endowments to increase its income.!
Two often donations of large sums have restrictions at-!

tached to them, that they are to go for a specific purpose I
so these class funds are practically the only unencumbered ,
donations that Stanford has.
It should be remembered that a student may subscribe \
to any amount, to begin making the annual payments in'
any year convenient to him and he may slop his donations
entirely or suspend them for a number of years. There is'
absolutely no necessity of payment incurred in signing the
pledge.
Although the card asks for an indication of the amount
that the student intends to contribute, it is not necessary |
to lill in a certain sum. As most students have no idea ;
what their financial status may be a few years after leav-I
ing school, it would be advisable to leave the amount j
blank.
All soon-to-be alumni should subscribe to their class
fund. It would show an appreciation of their education i
received here at way below the actual cost. There is cer- ,
tainly no more worthwhile enterprise to which a graduate!
of Stanford could donate.
