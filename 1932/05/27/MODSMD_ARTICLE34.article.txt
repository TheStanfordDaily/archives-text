# "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?"
## 
### 
Pity the poor seniors. Harassed by thoughts of amas
sing sullicicnt units for graduation, they are still further
distracted by well-meaning friends who approach each
intended graduate willi the inevitable, heart-rending
query, "W hat arc you going to do next year?"
The unfortunate members of the class of \'i2 don't know
what they are going to do. Judging by the ominous signs
of continued depression they may very well be starving by
this time next year. At the best, some of them will be
digging ditches and packing ice. Hut they don't know;
they can't tell; they have mighty few ideas, and it gives
them cold chills to lie reminded of their predicament.
All the seniors ask is to be left alone in their misery.
In the name of humanity il is only right that their mourn
ful plea be heeded and their last wish respected.
