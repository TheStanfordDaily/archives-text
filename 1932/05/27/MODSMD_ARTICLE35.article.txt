Il is not settled whether the t'nited States will send a
destroyer to bring Amelia Earhart Putnam back to her
home country, nor whether Congress will vote her the
Congressional medal of honor as it did to Lindbergh.
Mrs. Putnam, excellent flyer, offers a charming re
semblance to Lindbergh, and among transoceanic livers
other than Ryrd, perhaps offers the nearest approximation
to his good taste.
The t'nited States, 011 second score, is grateful to the
slim, tousled Amelia for not having fallen into the ocean,
thereby paralyzing shipping, and war maneouvers, and
causing innumerable aviators to die in the search for her.
A picturesque figure, her material service is to till mil
lions of pages of newspaper space, thrill the news-reading
groundlings, and provide 1 aviation with one of the publicity
boosts which rank second only to aeronautical invention.
The hope that she might have done it for Amelia's own
love of living is blasted hv her entree into the inevitable
triumphal "lour."
New York's welcome is ready, ticker tape to telephone
book; and every woman's club and business group in the
country has its luncheon planned.
Hut Mrs. Putnam is not Lindbergh, nor is any other
fiver; and il is a little wearisome to expect a nation to go
through the extreme range of response that poured so
spontaneously at Lindbergh's feet.
A good, lough, ironic lest, were it not nngallanl, would
be to lend Amelia the Akron to fly home, and if she man
aged to gel that unwieldy craft across a span of water, to
give her not only the Congressional medal, but the whole
Akron-building (Congress.
