# BULL SESSION
## TAMMANY ON THE SPOT 
### 
To investigate is admirable; to in- |
: vestigate graft is noble; and to in- j
' investigate Tammany Hall graft is j
I bordering on the divine. That is the J
! way most people feel about the |
I current Seabury investigation on '
graft und corruption in New York j
I City. Graft if: disliked by so many i
| people because they have no chance '
to participate in its rewards. People
are always apt to rail against any- i
1 thing beyond their reach.
I Of course, ever since Cartoonist j
| Nast saddled the "tiger symbol" on ;
I the "Benevolent and Patriotic Or- j
1 der of Saint Tammany," that or- ;
ganization has become the popular
emblem of corruption. The Tam-;
many Tiger is both euphonious and |
imagination - capturing. Everyone j
hates the silent, sleek, fierce assas- j
sin of the jungle; und now poor j
Tammany must suffer for every
Hindu a Bengal tiger lays paws on. |
"
That is why anyone can be popu
lar by investigating Tammany Hall.
Especially is this the case because
every hick or small-towner from
Maine to California is sure that the
"Big City" is pretty bad in all ways
—political ways especially. In real
ity, Tammany is probably no worse
than the Vare machine in the pure j
Quaker City—also home of the "A's"
| of baseball fame; and New York is
| probably even relatively cleaner
: than Chicago. The only trouble is
! that Tammany is so permanent—

I and so successful. Varc may lose; j
' Thompson may lose; Tammany I
■MAY lose—but it doesn't.
I
| The real reason for the presentj
j investigation is to embarrass the;
Democrats in general and Franklin i
jD. Roosevelt in particular. Every j
| knock is a boost —for the Repub- ,
licans. If the public's scorn can be ■
j fixed on Tammany and Roosevelt!
j can be attached to Tammany—the j
! scorn will also be fixed on Demo-:
j cratic Presidential Possibility Roose- i
| veil. If the Governor fails to favor !
! the investigation, he is linked up ;
j with evil and corruption. If he does
I aid the investigation, he is not j
: linked witli anybody—and no poli- j
[tician enjoys loneliness. Faced with;
I the two alternatives, Roosevelt can
i do nothing but perspire freely.
The Republican legislators proved
their purity by launching an inves-
I tigation against a Democratic city.
I The Democratic legislators not de- l
siring to be outdone in holiness at
tempted to push an investigation'
into the Republican cities of up- i
state New York. Being a minority,
however, they were not allowed to |
prove their high-mindedncss.
Even though conceived in politi- )
j cal intrigue, and dedicated to what
many feel is a no-good purpose
(the ruining of Roosevelt), the Sea
bury Investigation may bring forth ]
some desirable results.
