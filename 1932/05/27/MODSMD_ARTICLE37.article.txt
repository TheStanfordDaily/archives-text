A certain hotel in Sun Francisco t
: was "Frantic" with excitement!
j Wednesday night when Ted Fio- '
Rito introduced his sjxteen-piece
! orchestra of radio stars in the Em- i
1 bassy Room.
! It Ls going to take a good man to
| "Phil'' Harris's shoes and judging \
\ from the opening performance, we j
should candidly say that Ted Fio-
I Rito is the man.
The dance groups and intermis- ■
j sions are a bit long for these sum- >
| mer nights but then "life is like !
j that."
I You can not fail to be delighted '
; with the music. No matter what you j
prefer Ted will play it. If you pash
j over slow and dreamy melodies, j
1 you will pash over "Lullaby of |
Leaves"; if you like 'em hot, you'll j
j jitter over "Wabash Blues." The |
| trio does things to that tune.
A decided characteristic is the in
| formal way in which the band
i vaguely drifts from one tune to the
other with only a few bars of piano
| interlude. Something else that is i
j new is the retreat of the violins and
I the predominance of the brass in
[ struments.
j Do pay the boys a visit. They're
j strangers in the town and you won't
! be sorry you called. —E.E.H.
MAN WANTED—At the Stanford

j This picture is conclusive evi
dence of the fact that the presence
I of Kay Francis is enough, not only
! to "make" any picture, but to make
j one sit up and take notice.
Miss Francis is the whole show, in
i this story of an editress who hires
a male secretary with the expected
j result. The fact that the expected
I result is achieved in a thoroughly
| delightful series of incidents makes
it all right.
i David Manners has one of the
; most charming personalities among
! the younger players, and he makes
lan excellent foil for the charming j
Miss Francis. But she is the whole |
| show: she smiles, She talks, she acts, j
' she dresses in such a way as to I
1 give alarm to many players with !

i larger followings. She gets our vote
| any time. —E.C.
SO BIG—At the Varsity Theatre.
Edna Ferber's novel has been put
| in films again, this time with Bar
bara Stanwyck taking the part of
I the tragic Salina —doing it well, too.
"So Big" does not approach the

1 filming of Miss Ferber's "Cimma
| ron," but it is, nevertheless', of some
; interest. Barbara Stanwyck, who
| has done some truly fine things for
i the screen, hands in her customary
! performance in her portrayal of the
i role that gave Colleen Moore a
I boost toward fame.

bara Stanwyck taking the part of
I the tragic Salina —doing it well, too.
"So Big" does not approach the

1 filming of Miss Ferber's "Cimma

; interest. Barbara Stanwyck, who
| has done some truly fine things for
i the screen, hands in her customary
! performance in her portrayal of the
i role that gave Colleen Moore a
I boost toward fame.

A certain hotel in Sun Francisco t
: was "Frantic" with excitement!
j Wednesday night when Ted Fio- '
Rito introduced his sjxteen-piece
! orchestra of radio stars in the Em- i
1 bassy Room.
! It Ls going to take a good man to
| "Phil'' Harris's shoes and judging \
\ from the opening performance, we j
should candidly say that Ted Fio-
I Rito is the man.
The dance groups and intermis- ■
j sions are a bit long for these sum- >
| mer nights but then "life is like !
j that."
I You can not fail to be delighted '
; with the music. No matter what you j
prefer Ted will play it. If you pash
j over slow and dreamy melodies, j
1 you will pash over "Lullaby of |
Leaves"; if you like 'em hot, you'll j
j jitter over "Wabash Blues." The |
| trio does things to that tune.
A decided characteristic is the in
| formal way in which the band
i vaguely drifts from one tune to the
other with only a few bars of piano
| interlude. Something else that is i
j new is the retreat of the violins and
I the predominance of the brass in
[ struments.
j Do pay the boys a visit. They're
j strangers in the town and you won't
