The Editor, Sir: <
If Mr. MollinkofT has listened to :
Mrs. Putnam's broadcast from Ire
land or if he had read her views on ]
the flight, he would have noticed
that she did not expect her flight i 1
to be any advancement to aviation, j <

The Editor, Sir:
How many more insipid editorials j
are to be added to the lengthy list '
which have already roused the ire
of the student body?
In this, morning's editorial, '"40 |
Votes," you bemoan the failure of j
constitutional amendment number i
one, and belabor the "misled'' voters
for their rashness in expressing ,
their convictions, which happen to
) be inconsistent with your own. I
What is the purpose of placing con
stitutional amendments on the bal- j
i lot? Would it not be wiser to merely ;
| consult the Daily editor concerning ,
I a proposed change, and then follow i
his advice rather than consult the j
student body who might dare to \
disagree with the editor's "my view, ]
right or wrong," attitude? I

The measure was defeated and
defeated fairly because a repre
sentative portion of the student
body believed it unwise and ex
pressed their opinions accordingly. !
Then, too, your arguments in de
fense of the defeated measure are j
obviously inconsistent. You state j
that the new system might be "no j
improvement, it might even work
to disadvantage." Then you go on
to say: "The arguments against the
appointive Council are theoretical
and uncertain."
If the latter statement is true,
certainly your arguments in favor
of the amendment come under the
same classification of "theoretical |
and uncertain."
May we be relieved from those
"harmful irritants," your own per
sonal reactions, and be favored with }
0 few editorials which are broader, i
and, may we say, fairer?
Yours sincerely,
Gordon Steedman j
P.S.: There was a tune in the late
Junior Opera, which you so en
-1 joyed, entitled "Ain't you got no
jsense?"
Professor David L. Webster will'
| meet his physics class at the usual j
j time at 10 o'clock tomorrow morn- j
1 i'ig.

NO AID TO AVIATION
The Editor, Sir: <
If Mr. MollinkofT has listened to :
Mrs. Putnam's broadcast from Ire
land or if he had read her views on ]
the flight, he would have noticed
that she did not expect her flight i 1
to be any advancement to aviation, j <
Mrs. Putnam states that the flight I i
was undertaken merely for her per- !
sonal satisfaction.

AN IKED STUDENT
The Editor, Sir:
How many more insipid editorials j
are to be added to the lengthy list '
which have already roused the ire
of the student body?
In this, morning's editorial, '"40 |
Votes," you bemoan the failure of j
constitutional amendment number i
one, and belabor the "misled'' voters
for their rashness in expressing ,
their convictions, which happen to
) be inconsistent with your own. I
What is the purpose of placing con
stitutional amendments on the bal- j
i lot? Would it not be wiser to merely ;
| consult the Daily editor concerning ,
I a proposed change, and then follow i
his advice rather than consult the j
student body who might dare to \
disagree with the editor's "my view, ]
right or wrong," attitude? I

The measure was defeated and
defeated fairly because a repre
sentative portion of the student
body believed it unwise and ex
pressed their opinions accordingly. !
Then, too, your arguments in de
fense of the defeated measure are j
obviously inconsistent. You state j
that the new system might be "no j
improvement, it might even work
to disadvantage." Then you go on
to say: "The arguments against the
appointive Council are theoretical
and uncertain."
If the latter statement is true,
certainly your arguments in favor
of the amendment come under the
same classification of "theoretical |
and uncertain."
May we be relieved from those
"harmful irritants," your own per
sonal reactions, and be favored with }
0 few editorials which are broader, i
and, may we say, fairer?
Yours sincerely,
Gordon Steedman j
