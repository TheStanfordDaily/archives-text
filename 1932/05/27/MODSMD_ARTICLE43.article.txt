ly dear Dick,
Now that you are home after
our seven weeks' sojourn in the
alo Alto Hospital, you must won
er what's going on around the
'arm.
You will be surprised at how lit
e things change around here. The
cllar, lor instance, is STILL charg
ig the same old prices that average
1 per cent or more higher than
lose down town, and as l'or getting
small buttered and cuppacoffee in
rush before, an 8 o'clock —it's the
line old story. But then 1 guess
ou can't blame them for taking
of a monopoly situation
nd gouging the unfortunates who
it there.
Dink Templeton is still in Lane
ospital in San Francisco, but Mrs.
empleton says he will be home
ion. She takes him for automobile
des around the city and down the
eninsula several times a week
ow, and she expects that he will
e back at his Lasuen home in a
>uple of weeks. That means he will
•.? on deck for the Olympic trials,
hich should cheer him greatly.
And while we're on the sub
ject of hospitals, you will be
glad to know that Ralph (liber
son, who was hurt two weeks
ago in an automobile accident
similar to yours, is back in
training again and at last the
track squad has a sprinter. He
expects to enter the P.A.A. meet
at Kezar next week.
I was going to go up to the dog
ack at Belmont last night, but it's
ist as well I didn't. The feature
as a special race bringing together
ich pooches as Royal Palm, Crony,
unter's Home, Blanton, and Major
eague over the futurity course,
hey finished in that order, with
oyal Palm setting a new record
t this distance, which is 55 yards
nger than the quarter-mile, of
i 4-5 seconds. The best Crony, one
the favorites, could do, was sec
id. while Playgoer didn't even
ace. Royal Palm paid $15 to win
id $5.20 to place, while Crony paid
ily $3.60.
Royal Palm had beaten Crony he
re. but wasn't expected to repeat,
t the rate he was going last night
• could spot Ben Eastman about
'.(} yards and beat him!
With no track meet this week
id, there isn't much doing in an
hietic way on the campus just
iw. Pop Warner is still busy with
iring practice, and will be until
'xt week. Right now it looks like
d have quite a team next fall.
What with his new double
spinner and all. his backficld's
chief threat will lie SPEED, lie's
dropped the double fullback
idea, in view of the dearth of
heavy men. and is concentrating
on a flashy attack that should
cross up the opposition plenty.
More details next week.
Well, old man, I wish you were
•re to turn out "Slants" once in a
hile like you used to. Bob Wade,
ho will have the irksome job regu
rly next fall, is out to Looie's or
me such place tonight.
See you when school is out.
Sincerely,
L.M.C.
