# POSSIBLE LINE-UPS TO BE VIEWED TODAY AS WARNER SCRIMMAGES THREE SQUADS
## 
### 
I With spring football practice rap
j idly drawing to an unheralded
i close, considerable interest will cen
j ter on the varsity field this after
noon as Coach Pop Warner sends
1 his first three squads through a
j scrimmage game.
I The campus has paid little atten-
I tion to gyid activities lately, but the
men who strive to make up the
I 1932 varsity have been working each
afternoon in the week, with the
] first three squads practicing on
| Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
and the balance of the turnout go
ing through their paces on Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday.
Line-up Taking Shape
As the end of the practice ses
! sion looms near, however, a fair
I idea of how the team will line up
next fall can be had. There will be
changes, to be sure, but the men
j that scrimmage this afternoon can
' be counted upon for grid work next
i fall.
The present first-string backfield
â–  of Hillman, Caddel, Campbell, and
Maentz is a good one and may re
main intact for next fall's games,

I while the second-string quartet,
j with Hancock at full, Anderson,
| quarter, and Moore and White,
j halves, is also pretty certain of be
] ing on the field.
Line Uncertain
If changes are to be made, it will
I undoubtedly be in the forward wall.
No satisfactory combinations have
jas yet been found, but certain
! members of the present line have
' stood out.
The first team will have Tod and
Buchanan, ends, Lettunich and
Palamountain, tackles, Kite and
j Corbus, guards, and Bates, center,
while the second group lines up
: with Miller and Holmes, ends,
I Prelsnik and Rogers, tackles, Maino
| and either Card or Tarver, guards,
and Blanchard, center.
