# MACNAUGHTON AND SEAVER MEET FOR UNIVERSITY TITLE
## 36 Hole Golf Final Begins At 9 O'Clock; Last Half At 1:15 
### Maurice Rapf 
The golfing supremacy of Stan
ford University will be decided over
the local course tomorrow when
Charlie Seaver and Male MacNaugh
ton wind up play in the school
tournament with a 36-hole match.
It will be last year's number one
man against the sophomore, Seaver,
who topped the golf ladder during
the present seasonâ€”two men who
play the most brilliant golf and rise
to great heights in competition.
Little Practice
The chief advantage in Seaver's
favor is the fact that Male has had
so little practice this year. Charlie,
on the other hand, has competed in
several tournaments already, and
with no little success, having won
the Northern California amateur
championship at San Jose about a
month ago.
MacNaughton, however, v/as in top
form last week in defeating Bud
Eichelberger G and 5. He scored 74
for the first eighteen holes, and was
even par for the second turn when
he finished the match on the 14th
green. His toughest encounter was
against Jerry Trautman whom he
defeated 1 up at the 18th hole.
Easy Victories
Seaver, on the other hand, has had
no difficulty in any of his encoun
ters to date. In the 36-hole semi
finals last week, he defeated Gene
Brown 8 and 7, and previous to this
had scored victories over Coffen,
Teague, and Edwards by similarly
wide margins.
The public is invited to follow the
match around the course. They tee
off at 9 o'clock in the morning for
the first eighteen holes and at 1:15
o'clock for the second round.
