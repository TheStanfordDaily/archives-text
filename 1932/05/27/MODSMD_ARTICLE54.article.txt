# 'DINK' LAUDS TWO UNHERALDED MEN OF TRACK SQUAD
## Discus Ability Of Laborde, Jones Is Dimmed By Eastman's Fame 
### 
Dink Templeton, the '"boy" who i
knows a great deal about track and j
who writes nearly as much, lauded I
two unappreciated Stanford spike- j
men loud and long in a city news- j
paper recently.
The "heroes for a day" were Bob 1
Jones and Here Laborde, who stand j
pre-eminent in the realm of Ameri- j
can discus-throwers and yet who, |
because of the presence of a more
sensational Eastman and the more
invalidized Hables on the squad,
have not been getting their just
share of the crowd's plaudits and
the press's columns.
Ten Feet Better
Jones and Laborde are ten feet
or more better than any other col
legiate plate-whirlers in the United
States and will be as much ahead of
all Americans in this event unless
tall Paul Jessup, former Washington
star and present claimant for the
world's record, suddenly returns to
his 1930 form.
Jones has an official mark of IGI j
feet plus, made in the S.C. meet.
He has forced the disk over 1(57 feet
in practice, having five throws be
feated by a college thrower in two
years. i
Lahorde's Best Mark
Laborde's best mark is around
157 feet, but he too has done better
in practice ,having five throws be
yond the 164-foot mark made after
the regular event was over in the
1 Fresno relays.
Nellie Gray of Stanford and Bob
Hall of U.S.C. rank behind Jones
and Laborde. Strange as it may
seem, these four men, three of
whom will probably be seen in the
Olympics, all met in the Stanford-
Troy dual meet.
An Austrian motorcycle racer has
invented a stream-lined metal form
to attach to his back to increase his
speed.
