NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 2G. (/P)
—Drastic curtailments in Yale's in
tercollegiate athletic program with
shifting of primary emphasis to in
tramural sports for "fun and in
formality" were outlined today by
President James Rowland Angell in
announcing acceptance of a survey
committee's recommendations.
The new program, to go into effect
after the residential college plan is
established in 1933, will see reduc
tion of the varsity football schedule
to five games, stringent cuts in ath
letic costs, free admission for under
graduates to all games, and elimina
tion of scouting, class teams and the
150-pound football team.
Instead, stress will be laid on
sports for all students, with as little
practice and as much competition
as they want.
Harvard and Princeton authorities
have expressed sympathy with the
general objectives, said President
Angell.
Urging that all athletic budgets
be reduced, the committee said, "the
tremendous cost of athletics at Yale,
as well as at all other universities,
is the outgrowth of the nation-wide
wave of post-war extravagance and
was made possible by the enormous
athletic receipts of that period."
The committee suggested the foot
ball schedule include many informal
games without gate receipts.
