# SENIORS PLAN TO LOOSE SHACKLES ON FARMERETTES
## 
### 
At last the senior women of Stan- '
ford will be freed from the binding j
shackles of convention that have j
bound them for four long years. I
For the first time in the history of i
Herbert Hoover's alma mater, women !
of the Farm will be allowed to at- <
tend a smoker. Jack Tarr and Bob j
Nichols, who are arranging this '
novel form of class entertainment j
exclusively for seniors, have also j
promised free cigarettes for the long !
downtrodden but now liberated 1
alumnae-that-are-to-be.
Yet strange as are women at a j
smoker, the senior men have a still i
stranger role to play. In collabora
tion with the free cigarettes for both
sexes will be informal dancing, and
the men are themselves expected to
shatter an eternal tradition and con- !
tinually cut-in. To complete the j
program without precedent, versatile i
entertainers will be featured be- ;
tween the dance numbers.
The affair will be held on Wed- \
nesday, June 1. At what' place? !
Read Monday's Daily, seniors, and i
plan to attend.
