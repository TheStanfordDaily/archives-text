# STANFORD CAR IN RACE CLASSIC
## Auto Designed By Campus Professors To Get Test 
### 
With the automobile developed by
i Professor E. G. Reid of the Gug
j genheim Aeronautic Laboratory
1 and U. A. Patchett, an instructor in
I mechanical engineering, racing, a
| new record very possibly may be
I set at the Memorial Day 500-mile
! classic at Indianapolis today.
Patchett said yesterday, that the
I car, piloted by "Stubby" Stubble
field, the famous racer, has a very
good chance to win. For the first
three laps of 2 1/ 2 miles each at the
qualifying trials last week it was
the fastest car in the field, but a
blowout lowered its average, Pat
ehet said.
Over the first eight miles its aver
j age was 117 miles per hour, but for
| the 10 miles it was only 110. It will
j be in competition with 40 automo
j biles today, and ranks about ninth
J among them after the trials.
j Two weeks ago the car broke five
! world records in trials near Mo
j have. These were the mile, five
J miles, kilometer, five kilometers, and
j mile for four-cylinder cars of un
| limited displacement. Its fastest
i time was 148.2 miles per hour in
| the kilometer.
Principles of airplane design
I worked out in the laboratory were
j embodied in the design of the car,
the first for use on a curved track
j ever to be scientifically streamlined
! in America. Even the bottom is en
| closed, and the result is that there
j is little air drag.
I In addition, certain improvements
! worked out by Patchett were in
| corporated in the Miller motor, giv
i ing it increased smoothness of oper
! ation at high speeds. It is also pos
jsible that the power may be greater,
| although no tests have been made.
