### Bill Cole 
Finding it hard enough to hear
himself replying to the many people
who visit him during a day's busi
ness, Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary
of the Interior and Stanford's presi
dent -on-leave, has always drawn
the line at echoes.
When he first appeared in the of
fices set aside for the head of the
interior department, he glanced
around, according to the legend, and
announced in no uncertain tones
that he could not work in such
great open spaces. Two huge totem
poles stand on each side of the door,
the furniture is of the massive type,

I and there is a truly baronial lire- !
! place.
Wilbur explored around a bit, j
opening doors here and there, until 1
I with satisfaction he discovered a ;
small storeroom with adequate j
light. He promptly moved in, and j
still is there to the surprise of for-i
, mal Washington.
A parallel exists at Stanford, |
where Wilbur also refused to oc- j
| cupy the lofty-ceilinged office of
the president. It is now used fori
board meetings, while Dr. Robert E. j
| Swain does his work as acting- j
| president in a cozy former store
i room. 1
