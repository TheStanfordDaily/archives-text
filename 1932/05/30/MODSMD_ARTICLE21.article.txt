# JAMISON GIVEN 'OLYMPIA' LEAD
## Lyons, Wolf, Geddis, Davis Take Other Roles 
### 
Jean Jamison, star of two Junior
Operas and songstress in several
editions of the Gaieties, will appear
for the first time in a dramatic part
when she reads the title role in
Ferenc Molnar's satiric comedy,
"Olympia," at an open meeting of
Sword and Sandals to be held next
Thursday evening in the Little
Theatre.
James Lyons, one of the campus'
most experienced actors, offers the
chief support as Captain Kovacz, a
soldier who is able to answer the
aunts of Princess Olympia, after she
has sent him away from her, with a
subtler and keener punishment.
Others in the cast include Joseph
Wolf as Krehl; Ter-rence Geddis as
Princ Plata-Ettingen, father of
Olympia; Viginia Clemens as Count
ess Lina; and Dave Davis as her
husband, Count Albert. The import
ant role of Princess Eugenie, mother
to Olympia, has not as yet been
filled. Dr. Margery Bailey will read
the necessai'y stage directions.
This play is one of Molnar's best
and most trivial comedies; it is
brisk and brittle, seldom becomes
serious, and never falls into the dan
gerous abyss created by the Grau
stark romances. The characters are
alert, sophisticated persons of the
Austrian court, whose chief trouble
is keeping their family name un
spotted while they enjoy life fully.
This will be the last in the series
of bi-weekly readings presented to
the public at meetings of Sword and
Sandals, men's honorary dramatic
fraternity. "The response to the
project has, however, been so en
thusiastic, that a fall series is al
ready being arranged," said Vallejo
Gantner, president of the organiza
tion.
