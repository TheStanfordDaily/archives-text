# Walster Will Give Solo At Card Concert
## Orchestra Plays Tomorrow Night At 8 oâ€™Clock 
### 
Stanford's Symphony Orchestra
will present its quarterly concert in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock. By special arrangement
with the Committee on Public Exer
cises this feature of the Tuesday
evening series will be given half an
hour later than usual.
Miss Noel Walster is the featured
soloist. She is a talented soprano
who is well-known on the peninsula
for her work with the Morris Club,
under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, and as a finalist in the state
Atwater-Kent contest. She will sing
the beautiful ''Bird Song" from
Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," and
should give this aria finished rendi
tion as she is at present studying
for the operatic stage.
The extremely difficult First
Symphony by Sibelius is to be the
featured selection of the orchestra.
This Finnish fantasy is of unusual
beauty and complexity. It is as a
whole a succession of movements of
wild abandon and tender feeling,
expressing the temperament of a
Northern people.
Liszt's Symphonic Prelude com
pletes the program. In this selection
great originality was shown in com
position, and it is not divided into
entirely separate movements as is
the conventional symphony. Rather,
it has six themes all woven into
main theme whose purpose might
be expressed by the question, "What
else is life but a succession of pre
ludes to that unknown song whose
first solemn note is intoned by
death?"
The Symphony, composed of 60
musicians, is under the direction of
Marguerite McManus, who before
coming to Palo Alto was the head of
flie music department of Oregon
State.
