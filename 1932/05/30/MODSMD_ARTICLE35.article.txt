# IT'S NOT HARD TO BE SPORTSMANLIKE

Charlie Seaver won (ho golf championship of llie Farm
Saturday aflernoon, hut onlv after overcoming a nerve
racking obstacle erected for him by the warped enthu
siasm of one of the most unsportsmanlike galleries ever to
follow a title match.
II' 1 and Malcolm MaeXaughton had fought through
ihirty-five holes of a grueling, nip-and-tuck battle to arrive
al the home green even up. Mac had missed his putt for a
par lour, bis ball stopping so that it was almost in direct
Jine between Seaver's bail and the cup. Thus Seaver had
a partial stymie to overcome while attempting to sink what
otherwise would have been an easy four-footer. If he had
succeeded, he would have won the match and the school
championship right there. But be missed by a hair.
Ami the gallery applauded lustily! Applauded, when
one of the best sportsmen this University has ever seen
missed bis putt to win the golf title. The match had to go
on two more holes before Seaver could triumph. Had lie
lost, iL might well have been from shaken nerves caused
bv the ungcntlemanlv demonstration of the multitude.
Stanford crowds have often been accused of unsports
manlike lethargy in the face of defeat, at football games
and elsewhere. This has been regarded, more or less,
merely as the usual amount of moaning one expects to
hear emanating from rival institutions.
But let us take stock; might not there be a bit of truth
in the accusations of our contemporaries after all, if a
crowd of Stanford people show poor sportsmanship on a
golf course, the very sanctum of sports courtesy?
