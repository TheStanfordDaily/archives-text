# INTRAMURAL SPORTS AT YALE
## 
### 
Utile's new venture in supplanting intercollegiate by in-'
tranuira.l athletic competition is the first step in a move
ment that is likely to bring about a decided change in I
American college sports. Based on the system long estab
lished at the English universities, the new plan aims to
achieve a main objective of physical education leaders
everywhere, that of getting as many men as possible into
some form of athletics.
Obviously, more men can find places on six or seven
intramural teams than on one varsity aggregation. And
most of the intramural players will be those who are a
little below varsity caliber and would not be able to make j
the grade in intercollegiate sport no matter how large tlu 1 '
squad might be.
I 'nfortunately, however, Yale's idea cannot be success-j
fully worked out in all of the institutions in this country.!
Without a real desire to win, fostered by a substantial
group spirit, no team can attract recruits except from men
who are so enthusiastic that they play without any particu
lar incentive.
In a university such as Stanford, where living groups
are either too small or too disorganized to make intra-1
mural contests important, it is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to create effective interest in this type of sport, j
Present activities here are but a pale counterpart of what
could be instituted ii the campus were divided into a small
number of strong living groups.
Yale's scheme is being introduced following the estab-,
lislunent of the Oxford plan for student housing. Each of j
the colleges is so large, and at the same time so unified,'
that membership on one of its teams will mean something.
This will provide an incentive for candidates and will
create interest among the students as a whole, t'nder such
an organization the new plan will probably be a success,
but past experience seems to show that in a university not!
so arranged intramural affairs remain distinctly subordi
nate to varsity intercollegiate athletics.
