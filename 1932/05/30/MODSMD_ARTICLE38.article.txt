# BULL SESSION
## THE 						"SINGING FOOL" TURNS TO ECON 
### 
When A1 Jolson sings, some people
cry; and others have to restrain
themselves to refrain from crying
out in agony. When, however, the
"Mammy Singer" turns from black
mammies, about which he probably
knows very little, to dark economic
conditions about which he seems to
know even less, the chorus of wails
and groans becomes a deafening
earful. Mr. Jolson's contribution to
the growing body of liierature on
the depression is to "laugh it off."
Of course, the singer woukl first
attempt the Hearst live billion loan
plan—for which he "rates" Hearst
space. That failing, the "Laugh
Down the Depression Drive" is off
with A1 Jolson in first place. Fol
lowing him are all the penny
minded politicians—who gazing at
themselves —reason that "talk" can
put anything over —including pros
perity.
The coming of the depression was
a great shock to everybody and
some people are still suffering from
the mental vacuity that attends
shocks. These people have attempted
to ignore the depression in the hope
that, like a slighted guest, "unusual
conditions" will pack \ip and leave.
But the depression knows no law
but the economic law. The dictates
of Mrs. Post do not apply. The
country's leaders with this card
board frame of mind have been
singing in the national bath-tub for
so long that they seem to have de
veloped acute water-on-the-brain.
They plan to lure the sun back in
the sky with a song in their heart,

I as mile on their lips, and a spring
j in their step.
A frank recognition of the facts,
j an intelligent grasp of their signifi
| cance, an industrious attempt to
j meet them—that is the formula. Too
j many have deliberately blindfolded
j themselves, and have become dizzy
j running around in aimless circles.
| Then they mistake dizziness for di
i vine inspiration, and become sur
! prised when nothing happens.
I We know that ballyhoo aided Los
i Angeles in its tremendous change
j from a small village in Southern
j California to a largo village all over
j Southern California. Cigarettes have
'been put over with words; but the
j depression cannot be pushed over
j the cliff of speedy oblivion by simi
-1 lar means.
Imagine meanwhile the reaction
j of the millions of unemployed upon
| hearing that the depression can be
cured by laughter. Go up t« a man
i whose soul has been worn ragged
'by charity—slap him on the back,
! tickle him under the chin, and boom
i out LAUGH. Tell him to laugh his
troubles away. Advise wrapping a
rainbow around his drooped-over
shoulders. Tell him here comes the
sun.
If he is a low-order creature, he
will be tempted to place a chapped
fist on tho end of your chin. If he
is of a higher order, he might re
tort, "Around which corner is the
sun coming?"

When A1 Jolson sings, some people
cry; and others have to restrain
themselves to refrain from crying
out in agony. When, however, the
"Mammy Singer" turns from black
mammies, about which he probably
knows very little, to dark economic
conditions about which he seems to
know even less, the chorus of wails
and groans becomes a deafening
earful. Mr. Jolson's contribution to
the growing body of liierature on
the depression is to "laugh it off."
Of course, the singer woukl first
attempt the Hearst live billion loan
plan—for which he "rates" Hearst
space. That failing, the "Laugh
Down the Depression Drive" is off
with A1 Jolson in first place. Fol
lowing him are all the penny
minded politicians—who gazing at
themselves —reason that "talk" can
put anything over —including pros
perity.
The coming of the depression was
a great shock to everybody and
some people are still suffering from
the mental vacuity that attends
shocks. These people have attempted
to ignore the depression in the hope
that, like a slighted guest, "unusual
conditions" will pack \ip and leave.
But the depression knows no law
but the economic law. The dictates
of Mrs. Post do not apply. The
country's leaders with this card
board frame of mind have been
singing in the national bath-tub for
so long that they seem to have de
veloped acute water-on-the-brain.
They plan to lure the sun back in
the sky with a song in their heart,

I as mile on their lips, and a spring
j in their step.
A frank recognition of the facts,
j an intelligent grasp of their signifi
| cance, an industrious attempt to
j meet them—that is the formula. Too
