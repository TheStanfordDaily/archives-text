Well, boys and girls, here we are!
Yes, we might even go so far as to
say, we are here. Be it ever so
freakish there's no place like home,
we're telling yuh.
And just ask us, were w sur
prised at the tremendous ovation
we got when we arrived? Frankly, I
we were not only surprised but just j
a little bit hurt. Was the band lined '
up at the station to greet us? Was j
the debate squad champing at the 1
bit to get started with welcoming
speeches? Were the lovely sun
burned co-eds trembling eagerly
just at the chance to catch a glimpse
of us as we stepped onto the plat
form? Well, they probably were, of I
course, but we didn't hear anything |
about it.
finally managed to catch a ride |
up Palm Drive with the head cook \
at Roble, and he didn't know who j
we were, even after we'd explained
it carefully to him. And then we
ran out of gas about half way up
the drive, and had to wade back
across and around the newest ob
struction in the famous gateway to
get some more.
Finally got home, raced upstairs,
and went bursting into our room
The roommate was studying geology j
or divorce laws or something, and |
glanced up to see what the noise j
was al labout. Then, remarking |
quietly, "Hello, Jam, thought you j
were taking a trip or something," j
he went calmly on with his work.
It wasn't that way in the old days,
no suh. Something has happened to
demoralize this campus, and we
reckon as how we're just the guy to
find out about it.
If it's that ghost woman story
you're all worried about, for gosh'
sake forget it. That yarn is as old
as Encina. 'Way back in 000, when

the old man was in school (You've
heard about our old man, of course
—"Clipper" Ship, the blond dread
naught?) a Ghost Girl used to ap
pear in this same strange manner —
without benefit of the "tall, dark,
in evening clothes'' appearance,
though. She was just plain ghost.
They thought then that she was an
alumna hanging around waiting for
a refund from the Bookstore, but
she should have learned better by
this time.
Meanwhile, there are lots better
mysteries to worry about. Why did
n't the big Chi Psi political coup
work? What's happened to the fam
ous Theta swimming parties? What's
become of the free-thinking gals
who swore they'd appear on Quad
absolutley soekless on the first warm
day? And where, oh where, is our
host of travel-minded admirers?
Where? Wearily, W.
