St AHI ACL â€” At the Stanford
Theatre.
This is the picture that gangsters
tried to stop (or so we are told) and
the picture which was to end gang
; ster pictures forever. The exposure
of A1 Capone and his crowd via the
talkies is a noble attempt in the face
of previous shows such as "The
Public Enemy" and "The Doorway
! to Hell," not to mention "Little Cue
i sar." That we did not catch our
! selves yawning as bullets flew and
! bodies "bit the dust" seems to us
I to be a tribute in itself.
j Paul Muni was first and foremost
las the bullet-proof racketeer who
laughs at death and likes things ex
-1 pensive, especially in the way of
women. Incidentally, Karen Morley
! is the girl who captures the big
I shot's interest. Well, we would have
J to stretch the point if we admitted
! Muni was a gentleman.
Ann Dvorak, as the little sister of
j Scarface, deserves mention as a
! first-rate dramatic actress, and ap
j proaches close to being a tear
i jerker. She describes herself as a
I young girl with grown-up ideas,
J which isn't hard to take at all.
The picture as a whole is consid
i erably overdone, which has been a
; fault of most gangster pictures.
I That weakness is inevitable, how
| ever, if the show is to be at all in
| teresting. But the interjection of
| numerous bits of propaganda here
j and there mars an otherwise top
j notch talkie.
