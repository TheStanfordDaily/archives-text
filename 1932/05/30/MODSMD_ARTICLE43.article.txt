LES HABLES may yet compete
for Stanford in the I.C.A.A.A A.
meet at Berkeley in July. After
several weeks spent in the wilds of
the lower Salinas valley. King City's
fastest human is back on the Farm
and is working out again.
Hables is not registered in the
University, having had to take out
a leave of absence several weeks
ago and depart for warmer climes
to clear up some stubborn .sinus
trouble. A special ruling has yet to
be made on the matter of his com
peting, but there is precedent lor
favorable action. In 1928 the entire
Stanford track team took out leaves
in order to compete in the 1.C.4-A.
and Olympic Trials.
While he has not run any time
trials since his return, Les says he
feels in great shape. The first test
of his condition will be the P.A.A.
meet at Kezar Saturday, when he
v/ill enter the sprints unattached.
STANFORD'S CHANCES in
the 1.C.4-A., such as they are,
would he greatly strengthened
if Hables enters. Last year the
Indians were regarded as IS or
20 points weaker than U.S.C.
when they boarded the train for
the East, but they came within
less than two points of nosing
out tiie Trojans.
Les was an important factor
in the surprising showing made
by Stanford, and any points he
might garner this year might
just make the difference between
victory and defeat.
"I'd like to get another crack
at those U.S.C. sprinters," Hables
said last night. "As a matter of
fact, I'd rather compete at
Berkeley than in the Olympic
Games."
BEN EASTMAN seems to have
created a fad for breaking records.
Two fell over the week-end, one on
the track and one in the field.
Ralph Metcalf, the dusky streak
of Marquette University, hung up
a mark of 20.4 seconds for the 220-
yard dash in a quadrangular meet
held at Chicago Saturday. The
recognized standard of 20.(5 seconds
was set by Roland Locke, the sen
sational University of Nebraska
star, in 1926.
Herman Brix pushed the brass
ball out 52 feet, 8% inches to set a
n> j w world record for the shot at
the Kern county relays at Taft Sat
urday night. The official record of
52 feet, inches is held by Emil
Ilirsehfeld of Germany and was set
in 1928.
Another standard was tied by
George Saling of the University of
lowa when he slid over the 120-
yaid high hurdle route in 14.4 sec
onds at lowa City, Saturday.
