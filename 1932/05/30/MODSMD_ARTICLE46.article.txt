# Seaver Defeats MacNaughton in Golf Finals
## WINS TITLE AFTER MATCH HAS GONE TWO EXTRA HOLES Long Putt On 38th Green Decides Outcome Of Close Encounter 
### Maurice Rapf 
Charlie Seaver sank a 20-foot putt
on the 38th green of his match with
I Malcolm MacNaughton last Satur-
I day on the Stanford course and won
J the University golf championship.
Handicapped by rain and wind,
i the two golfers were unable to play
j perfect golf, but finished even up
on the 30th green, only after Seaver
had missed a three-foot putt, which,
if made, would have won the match
for him.
They halved the first extra hole
with par five's, and then came the
deciding 38th. Two good drives, with
Seaver somewhat further from the
tee. Mac, however, sends his second
| shot on the green about ten feet
j from the cup and Charlie does the
.same thing with his ball further to
the right.
Sinks Putt
Seaver's putt drops in the cup for
a birdie three, and MacNaughton
! must sink his ten-footer to halve
{ the hole and even up the match
I again. The ball starts for the cup, is
•short as were most of Mac's tries,
j slightly to the right, and the match
is over with Seaver the winner.
A gallery of about 200 battled the
adverse weather and saw the two
finalists battle on practically even
terms in both morning and after
noon rounds. As close as the contest
was, MacNaughton only had the lead
once, at the 6th hole, when he was
1 up.
Seaver 2 Up
Seaver was 2 up at the end of
the morning round, and had his op
ponent four down at the 24th tee.
j But the color of the match took on
; a decidedly MacNaughton aspect
| from this point on, with last year's
! captain cutting Charlie's lead down
j and finally squaring things on the
! 34th hole.
j Mac won the 24th and 2Gth with
' three's, a birdie and a par, but
! Charlie went three up again when
j MacNaughton missed an eight-foot
; putt on the next hole. Again on the
; 28th, Mac three-putted the green to
| halve the hole with Seaver who re
; covered from a trap and went down
j in five.
i MacNaughton cut Charlie's lead
! on the 30th, and then scored a birdie
two on the 32d, while Seaver was
j short and had to lift his second shot
ito the green from the ravine to
' score a four. They halved the next
hole with par four's, but here again
J Mac missed a short putt when he
I should have won the hole.
Even on 34th
Seaver hooked three balls in a
; row on the 34t,h, landing in the
j rough each time, while Mac hit two
i straight balls and was on the edge
i of the green in two and down in
| four to win the hole and even up
| the match with two holes to go.
Both men missed putts to halve
I the 35th with four's. On the 36th,
! MacNaughton's second shot went
| over the green up near the club
j house, while Charlie's stood on the
i far edge of the green.
MacNaughton chipped back but
■ went about ten feet beyond the cup.
' Seaver's putt was three feet short
1 and then followed Mac's first which
' missed the hole by less than an inch,
j Seaver had to sink his short putt to
I win the match, but Charlie couldn't
do it, and in missing the cup, al
most touched his opponent's ball
which would have lost the match
for him.
