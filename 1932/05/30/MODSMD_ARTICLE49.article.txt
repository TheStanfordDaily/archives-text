coming Olympic Games at Los Angeles.)

The official weeding-out process
for the American Olympic team be
gan Saturday at Seattle when twen
ty-five Northwestern athletes
equalled or surpassed the arbitrary
standards set up as entrance re
quirements to the semi-final Olym
pic tryouts to be held throughout
the country on July 1 and 2. The
first Stanford athlete to make an
official bid for the 1932 team fell
temporarily by the wayside when
Amiq West, now representing the
Olympic Club, hop - step - and -
jumped 45 feet, 2's inches, less than
ten inches below the required 4(5
feet.
West will take another crack at
the hop-step-and-jump in the Pa
cific Association meet at San Fran
cisco next Saturday, and may sur
pass 46 feet. George Martin, bril
liant Washington State jumper, won
the hop-step-and-jump at 47 feet,
and then turned in a 24 feet, 8 inch
broad jump to qualify for this event
as well.
Paul Jessup, world's record hold
er, and Ken Moeller, one-time Pa
cific Coast champion, just did man
age to exceed the 145-foot discus
standard to qualify for the Long
Beach semi-finals. Jessup won the
discus at 150 feet, 2 inches, and
threw the shot 49 feet, 8 inches to
lose by one-eighth of an inch to
George Thcodoratus, sensational
Washington State freshman.
The great liulph Hill beat his
brother Clarence by three hundred
yards, to win the 5,000 meters in
15 minutes, 10 seconds, a good ten
seconds faster than the time neces
sary to qualify.
The Northwest's two middle-dis
tance champions, Talbot Hartley
and Eddie Genung, qualified in their
favorite events, Hartley racing 400
meters in 48.7 seconds, and Genung
trotting home in 1:53.8 for 800
meters. Eight sprinters equalled or
bettered 10.8 seconds for 100 meters
to qualify for this event, but none
of the runners could approach the
21.3 standard for 200 meters.
Perhaps the most* brilliant per
formance of the day was made by
Bracken, University of Washington
hurdler, who placed third in the
110-meter hurdles, won the 200-
meter hurdles, and came back to
qualify for the 400-meter hurdle

race, by winning in 54 seconds, j
dangerously close to the Olympic !
record for the event.
Three javelin throwers qualified,
by heaving the spear over 190 feet,
but a tragic note was injected into
the day's festivities, when Bobby
Robinson, the little Eugene negro,
tied for first in the pole vault at 13
feet, six inches less than he needed
to qualify. Robinson was once con
sidered the greatest pole-vaulter in
intercollegiate competition. 1
Wills of Washington State won
the 1500 meters in the excellent
time of 3:59.6.
