# CARDS DOWN UTES IN POLO PREMIERE BY 4-GOAL MARGIN
## Highly Favored Indians In Close Battle Before Winning 9-5 
### 
Favored to down the Utah poloists
by a top-heavy score, Stanford
scored a victory by the compara
tively small margin of 9-5 in the
first of a two-game series played at
Salt Lake City Saturday.
Only two first-string players were
In the starting line-up, which might
partially explain the none-too-de
cisive victory. Rufus Spalding at
number two and Pete Gillham at
the back position of number four
were the only varsity riders to start
the game.
Spalding had amassed five goals
by the half-time and it looked as
though the Redshirts would be easy
victors. Pete Lewis, varsity rider
who 'regularly plays at number
three, was sitting on the sidelines
itching for a chance to get into the
game. Since it seemed evident that
Spalding's scoring ability wouldn't
be needed further, Coach Gordan
sent in Lewis at half-time to re
place Spalding.
Lewis didn't turn out to be the
sharpshooter that Spalding had
been, scoring only one goal in the
last half. Meanwhile Utah brought
its score up to five goals before the
final gong. Stanford was on the
short end of the scoring all dur
ing the second half, but the early
lead built up by Spalding was more
than eonugh to win the game.
The Redshirts play the final game
of the series today. Captain Gor
dan, coach of the Card riders, said
in a special wire to the Daily that
he was expecting a hard battle in

i
this final match. "Utah shows a
great deal of improvement since
playing us in February. Expect even
harder game tomorrow," Gordan
wired yesterday.

Holt (2) 1 Anderson (1)
