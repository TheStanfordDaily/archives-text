"A perfect rosette," said C. B. Faurqurean, confederate veteran,
to Ruth Wood of Richmond. The rosette is the result of a collision of
a confederate bullet and a union bullet fired simultaneously, in the
same line across a Richmond battlefield. They came across it as they
were preparing civil war curiosities for exhibition at the forty-second
reunion of United Confederate Veterans in Richmond, June 21.
