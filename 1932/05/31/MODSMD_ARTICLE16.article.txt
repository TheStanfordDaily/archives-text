# Boyles Does Not Want To Run Any More
## Campus Light Gives Up Political Ghost 
### 
I "I retire from public life!" was
| the statement issued yesterday by
i Edgar Amos Boyles, prominent
Campus politician, following last
| night's election of the new Rally
l Committee chairman.
His withdrawal from a hectic life
on the local political battlefields
I was no more dramatic than the
I fashion in which he began his
| career as a leader on Ihe Farm.
Double Election
l Boyles first came to the attention
• of the Campus when he was elected
to two important positions, Men's
j Council secretary and Rally Com
! mjttee chairman, on the same day.
| Destined to go down in Stanford
history as a planner of stunts, as a
big rain-and-rally-man from Sacra
mento, as the father of Bozo the
Bear, and as the member of the
Men's Council who put the fear of
the Honor Code into the hearts of
quivering freshmen, Boyles has a
record few can equal.
Boyles' activities have always
| been accompanied by a fervor of
| excitement. His alleged cruelty to
j animals brought upon him the ficti
! tious wrath of a fake clubwoman.
' As promoter of the Masque Ball, he
I cowed the Stanford women into
j raising $500 to purchase the Queen
l ship for local talent.
Temporary Check
! His colorful career was only tem
j porarily checked by the untimely
activities of a four-footed member
| of the Rally Committee. As man
: ager of the Water Carnival a year
I ago, his campaign to launch an un-
I precedented number of new canoes
i was halted only by the fact that
j Lagunita had been dry for months.
Announcement of his renunciation
I of further participation in public af
j fairs came late last night. Charac
j teristically, he had little to say. "My
! declination as nominee for the
j A.S.S.U. presidency was my last
i piece of service as a Stanford of
| ficial."
