In just a few more weeks mem- |
bers of the Stanford undergraduate
body will receive in the mails the
familiar blue - printed documents. :
entitled "Stanford University—Of- j
ficc of the Registrar."
Looking under the column des- |
ignated "Spring Quarter," John i
"Rough" or Jane "500" will be :
moved to reflect on the marks listed !
therein. They may blame Sequoia ,
"rat races," Encina water lights, or j
Roblc bridge parties for failure to
study just before the finals.
But according to a report given
by C. Gilbert Wrenn to the Voca
tional Guidance Committee last j
week, about 400 students frankly i
stated that they blamed themselves
for failure to get better grades.
Very few of Stanford's annual I

crop of new students felt that the
instructor should be blamed for low
grades. Most of the undergraduates
admitted that it was a personal fail
ure which kept them from being
Phi Betes. Fifty-five per cent of the
freshmen said they didn't know how
to study. Thirty-five per cent of the
college transfers admitted the same
weakness.
Many others blamed insufficient
background and failure to work
hard. Only eight per cent felt that
unfair grading caused poor grades.
About IS per cent blamed poor lec
tures. Very few, 11 per cent, dis
liked the personality of the instruc
tor.
The statistics were compiled by
William F. Poynter, psychology ma
jor, who worked under the super
vision of C. Gilbert Wrenn.
