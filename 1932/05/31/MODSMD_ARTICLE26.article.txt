# ROGERS TO SEE N.M.I. POLO HERE
## Jimmy Rogers To Captain Invaders Thursday 
### Sheridan Hegland 
Making his first public appearance
ion the Stanford campus Thursday
afternoon, Will Rogers, world-famed
, humorist, will watch his son, Jimmy,
: lead the New Mexico Institute
| riders against the Cardinal poloists.
The Institute four should prove
; a real threat to Stanford's Pacific
Intercollegiate champions. The

j Southerners claim a long string of
| victories over the Southwest's best.
While little is known here con
j cerning Jimmy Rogers, advance re
! ports credit him as one of the main
: stays of the team. His famous
i father, a lifelong enthusiast of the
! game, is rated as a two-goal man
i himself.
Domestic Rivalry
However, the interest of the gal
i lery will center on how Will Rogers
| solves his domestic difficulty. For
j another son, Will Jr., '35 and a
I member of the polo squad, will be
, rooting for his upperclassman team
! mates to defeat the New Mexico
, outfit. Will Jr. will not be eligible
! to play until next year.
Will Sr. may overcome the di
; lemma by casting his lot with the
j referee, or perhaps may take a hand
|in the proceedings himself to in
! sure impartiality.
Fleming to Start
Meanwhile the Stanford poloists,
returning today from their tilts with
j Utah, will polish their teamwork to
j meet the Institute challenge.
J Feeling none-too-fit for the game,
I Captain Bruce Fleming, hard-rid
! ing Card defensive man, will start
lat his usual number four position.
I Fleming pulled a jockey muscle six
j weeks ago in scrimmage and since
Ihe Oregon State series has been
' resting in preparation for Thurs
! day's contest.
