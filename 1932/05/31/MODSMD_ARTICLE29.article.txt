# FASCIST FORCE BRINGS FALL OF BERLIN CABINET
## Claim Hindenburg Favors Nationalist Head For Chancellorship BRUENING QUITS POST New Elections May Sweep Hitler Into Control 
### 
BERLIN, May 30. (A>)—Chancel lor
Heinrich Bruening and his two
year-old Cabinet resigned today in
the face of the growing strength of
Adolf Hitler's Fascists and other
nationalistic parties and because of
dissatisfaction with government by
decrees.
The resignation came suddenly
today after the Chancellor had held
several private conferences with the
President.
Hold Secret Confab
Their conversations were not
made public, but it was known that
the President had demanded that
Dr. Bruening recognize the Nation
alists of the right in a realignment
of the Cabinet.
Dr. Bruening apparently stood by
his refusal to shake up his Cabinet
after the gains of the Nationalists
and the Nazis in the recent elec
tions, which put them in control of
the Prussian Diet and made serious
inroads into the strength of Dr.
Bruening's following in the Reich
stag itself.
Pressure Exerted
President von Ilindenburg lias
been under pressure in recent weeks
from the Conservatives and Junkers
(aristocracy) of East Prussia. The
latter insisted that Dr. Bruening's
contemplated decrees splitting up
East Prussian estates for the benefit
of the unemployed should not go
into effect.
These decrees were formulated by
members of his Centrist Coalition
Cabinet, and therefore involved the
fate of that body.
Nationalists Favored
As far as the mind of President
von Hindenburg was known today,
he leans toward the appointment of
a new Chancellor from the Nation
alists, but not the National Socialist
ranks, a Cabinet whose first duty it
will be to weather the coming Lau
sanne conference on war debts and
reparations.
Must Face Reichstag
After the return of the delega
tion from Lausanne, the new Cabi
net will have to face the Reichstag,
which probably will be dissolved,
after which the new elections would
have to be held, which might well
sweep Hitler into power.
