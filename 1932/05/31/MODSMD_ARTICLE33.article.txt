# REDUCE THE PRICE OF SENIOR BALL BIDS
## 
### 
All Hit' past year students have been listening to and
reading about the present financial depression. Most of I
them have suffered from it through curtailment of expense
money trom home or the scarcity of jobs for those working
their way through school.
But there is no sign of a depression in the announce-1
men I that bids tor the Senior Hall will sell this year for the
old prosperity price, $10. It is hard to reconcile this pau-j
city ot lunds among students with this admission tax, sug
gestive of those faintly remembered boom times.
An investigation of the budget for the Hall shows that
Ihe expenses can be cut enough to make a substantial re-,
duction in the price of bids.
II is true that the dance could not be as elaborate if the'
admission is lowered but the difference would hardly be!
noticed by the near - graduates in attendance while the
effect on the poekelbooks of these same near-graduates j
would be most noticeable.
Because other senior classes have put on a Ball costing j
ten dollars a bid, il does not follow that Ibis class must j
charge the same exorbitant price. To hold fast to a precc-i
dent that changed conditions have made it advisable to!
alter is absurd dogmatism.
the committee can reduce the budget. Its only reason!
for not doing so is Ihe desire to put on a dance equal to or j
surpassing those of former years. But this is hardly the j
time to expend a large sum of money on Ihe Ball. The
gratitude of those saving a few dollars if the price of bids'
is lowered should be as gratifying to the committee as
expressions of awe on Ihe elaborateness of the function.
