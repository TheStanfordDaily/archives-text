# LET BEAUTY BE ENJOYED
## 
### 
The large electric clock, Ljift of the Class of \'M, now
being installed high up on the Quadrangle archway across
from the library unquestionably will be, as all good class I
gifts ought, an effective addition to the general scheme of
architectural beauty on the Stanford campus.
lint, unfortunately, aesthetic appreciation of this work j
of art will not be permitted to go on uninterrupted, for it!
will have numerals on its face around which a pair of
hands will circulate. In short, it will be just another time- |
piece to confuse students already victims of a bewildering
array of disagreeing clockwork.
Questioned as to why this clock could not be regulated
by a telegraph wire, the comptroller's office yesterday ex-j
plained that the size of the class gift prohibited such an
expenditure. Perhaps it has not occurred to anyone that
the cause of timeliness might be worth a bit of the Uni
versity's own money, or that this is an inviting opportunity
to install a system, with the new clock as master timepiece.
If this idea is too expensive, all well and good, let us
install the clock but refrain from running it, that students,
may enjoy its beauty unannoyed bv the effects of another!
misleading mechanism.
