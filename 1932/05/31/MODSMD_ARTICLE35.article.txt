Smoking lowers grades. This is the fearsome conelu-l
sion reaelied by a Washington Slate professor, who lias
.j us I conducted tests demonstrating, to his own satisfaction,'
that students who smoke make lower grades than non
smokers ofVcjual intelligence.
Here, indeed, is an epoch-making discovery. Those dis
concerting "D's" and "F's" that sully so many scholarship i
transcripts on this fair campus arc shown to he attribu-j
table to unwise inhalation of foul tobacco fumes, not pro
fessorial ill humor or a slight disinclination to study on
the part of the recipients.
It provides a new test of will-power. The eager search-,
er after learning must now say to himself, "One more
cigarette and I think that psych ex." Smoker entertain-j
ments will doubtless be frowned upon in administration '
circles, and instructors' notes on examination papers will
carry references to "that, cigar 1 saw you smoking last 1
week."
Of course, the Cougar savant may not have taken into!
consideration the fact that many non-smokers are such I
because they are of a studious type which does not indulge
in the time-wasting activities favored by dissipated butter
flies who pay less attention to classroom results. Hut, it
makes a good story.
