# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SENIOR BRAWL 
### 
When in the course of divine in
tervention, faculty leniency, and ad
ministrative disgust, a group of stu
dents prepare to stand in line and
receive a piece of sheepskin no
larger than half a sheet of binder
paper—it is customary to hold what
is officially termed the "Senior
Ball." This is a grand affair and
quite a climax to four years of ener
getic imbibing at the fountain of
knowledge—we are told. Here sen
iors gather for a last social farewell
before they enter upon the great sea
of Life—some to become captains—
most to remain deckhands and
stokers.
This being quite the rococo affair,
it has been the custom for the
"roughs" to starve themselves for
weeks to rake up the necessary
lucre. After all what was stai'vation
compared to saying goodbye to the
"buddies" at the best dance of the
year—which was the universal opin
ion of everyone. But all things
change—and the depression is a
custom changer of no mean repute.
In that this depression had not
only crimped but actually crumpled
so many students, it was thought
that, perhaps, the tariff would be
reduced. This idea was knocked in
the head, slugged in the midriff,
and finally put through the meat- I
grinder by the lords-that-be in the
senior class. The American creed is
bigger and better everything at all
costs; and no one could expect the ,
President of the Class of '32 or his i
dance committee to act in any way
that would detract from that high |
American ideal.
The preceding classes put on I
grand affairs, and the glory of '32 !
must not be impaired. Conceive of'

[ the damning disgrace—the black
blotch—lhe irreparable injury to
the honor of the Senior Class if
I there were less lights in the Toyon
I lobby this year; or we feasted on
i bacon instead of ham, or horrors of
j horror we danced to a ten-piece
! orchestra instead of a sixteen. Ima
, gine the inferiority complex that
j would dog the furtive footsteps of
; this year's graduates if their "final
j ball" was not up to the great tradi
i tion established during the years of
j plenty!
This year's budget is figured at
1 $2,200 —which is a fancy sum for
I one evening's entertainment. There
I seems little doubt that the dance
! committee will give everybody
$2,200 worth; but most people would
, rather enjoy less. Or most people
' cannot justify spending that much
j in a year of "unprecedented depres
j sion."
We want to make some cut in the
bid price—not only because it
would ease many people's wallets,
but it would ease everybody's con
science to know that we are making
some recognition of the critical con
j ditions under which the world is
! now suffering—and under which we
| too will be soon forced to bear our
1 part.
•
The cry of "these childish college
students" (who put their brains in
their notebooks and underline them
in red so as not to misplace them)
j will seem pitifully true if the Po
tentates of the Senior Class con
j tinue not only to resist popular ex
! pression of opinion, but likewise
I refuse to call class meetings to con
sider the question; and quietly re-
Imark that a "majority" petition de
i manding reduction will not be
' heeded. —Abe Mellinkoff

is officially termed the "Senior
Ball." This is a grand affair and
quite a climax to four years of ener
getic imbibing at the fountain of
knowledge—we are told. Here sen
iors gather for a last social farewell
before they enter upon the great sea
of Life—some to become captains—
most to remain deckhands and
stokers.
This being quite the rococo affair,
it has been the custom for the
"roughs" to starve themselves for
weeks to rake up the necessary
lucre. After all what was stai'vation
compared to saying goodbye to the
"buddies" at the best dance of the
year—which was the universal opin
ion of everyone. But all things
change—and the depression is a
custom changer of no mean repute.
In that this depression had not
only crimped but actually crumpled
so many students, it was thought
that, perhaps, the tariff would be
reduced. This idea was knocked in
the head, slugged in the midriff,
and finally put through the meat- I
grinder by the lords-that-be in the
senior class. The American creed is
bigger and better everything at all
costs; and no one could expect the ,
President of the Class of '32 or his i
dance committee to act in any way
that would detract from that high |
American ideal.
The preceding classes put on I
grand affairs, and the glory of '32 !
must not be impaired. Conceive of'

[ the damning disgrace—the black
blotch—lhe irreparable injury to
the honor of the Senior Class if
I there were less lights in the Toyon
I lobby this year; or we feasted on
i bacon instead of ham, or horrors of
j horror we danced to a ten-piece
! orchestra instead of a sixteen. Ima
, gine the inferiority complex that
j would dog the furtive footsteps of
; this year's graduates if their "final
j ball" was not up to the great tradi
i tion established during the years of
j plenty!
This year's budget is figured at
1 $2,200 —which is a fancy sum for
I one evening's entertainment. There
I seems little doubt that the dance
! committee will give everybody
$2,200 worth; but most people would
, rather enjoy less. Or most people
' cannot justify spending that much
j in a year of "unprecedented depres
j sion."
We want to make some cut in the
bid price—not only because it
would ease many people's wallets,
but it would ease everybody's con
science to know that we are making
some recognition of the critical con
