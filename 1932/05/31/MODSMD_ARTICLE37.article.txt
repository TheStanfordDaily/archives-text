ONCE A GRAND DUKE—By Alex
ander. Grand Duke of Russia.
Farrar and Rineharl, Inc. New
York, (At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.)
This best seller is bound to in
terest almost everyone, including j
those people who are interested in j
the history involved, those who like |
an inside picture of Russian poli- |
tics in the last days of the Empire !
and the period just after its fall, !
and those who like memoirs of j
European nobility and royalty.
The author is a cousin of the late !
Czar and married his sister. From
the late seventies to about 1900 his
story is interesting enough, but be
comes even more so after that
period, since he bcame one of the
real active heads of the government j
and comments intelligently on those j
exciting twenty years. Especially j
good is his criticism of the actions :
of the allies during that little-pub- \
licized period just after the end of ;
the war.
The author has an exceptionally
good offering for those who love to !
read details of life among the great. j
He fortunately takes his position so j
much for granted that he does not j
drag in long and pointless stories to ;
show how intimate he is with the i
King of England. He knows them
all, and doesn't have to boast. It's |
really very refreshing. —F.J.
THE VENETIAN—By Clifford Bax.
Farrar and Rinehart. 1931. $2. j
Clifford Bax, occasional dabbler
in intense melodrama (Upstream)
has written a very puzzling play.
The three unities seem not to bother
Mr. Bax in the slightest. In "The ,
Venetian," which one might sup
pose to be a Renaissance tragedy,
he calmly mixes with his alleged |
historical characters and the Flor
entine scene, a very modern hero- !
ine, much in the manner of Mr. i
Noel Coward, and a timeless situa
tion.
Bianca Capello is a rather start
ling female who philosophizes in [
the modern manner. Mr. Bax, prob- ,
ably in an attempt to remove the !
business man's traditional antipathy i
toward anything in costume, in
dulges in the most modern phrase
ology. One has the unpleasant con
sciousness that he will very likely
slip from "the azure skies" into the
English equivalent of the exquisite
Americanism, nerts. Such a condi
tion is undesirably pathetic.
Then, too, Mr. Bax has used for ,
his plot enough material to con
struct three plays; consequently the
act ends are ragged and the final
scene seems to have been introduced
for the purpose of killing off—in
very Borgian manner—all the im
portant characters, thereby stopping
the play.
In attempting to make his play as
understandably real to the modern
rudience as possible, Mr. Bax has
mixed genres and the result is an
unhappy series of philosophic
speeches, most of them cynical,
which flutter occasionally into
melodramatic action. In that it is
not unlike the plays of John Dry
den, Bax's somewhat more eminent
predecessor who, however, wrote
plays just as badly. —J.S.S.
"TIIE FLOATING ADMIRAL" —By
certain members of (ho Detection
Crime Club. 1932. (At the Palo
Alto Book Shop.)
The fourteen authors of this book
are well-known. They are G. K.
Chesterton, Canon Victor L. White
church, G. D. H. and M. Cole, Henry
Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode,
Milward Kennedy, Dorothy L. Say
ers, Ronald A. Knox, Freeman Wills
Crofts, Edgar Jrpson, Clomenco;

Dane, and Anthony Berkeley.
The group of English detective
story writers known as the Detec
tion Club was confronted with the
j question, "Could you solve the mys
] tery of your book if you had not !
I known the solution beforehand?"' ;
] Their answer was an elaborate game j
j of what is known in these parts as ;
I the game of "Murder." One author !
; wrote Chapter One of the mystery j
i and the subsequent writers each j
i tried to add new clues and to clear j
up old ones until the case was j
j solved. It is natural that they should j
| become a little confused. In one 1
1 case the author refers to the mur
| dered admiral's death as a drown
! ing, while the rest of the authors'

agree that it was a stabbing. Of
course this is rather mystifying to
I the best of detective story l-eaders. j
However, all things are straight
ened out in the end to the satisfac
tion of any reader because each of
; eleven authors gives his solution of
j the crime, and, as you can imagine,
. in eleven solutions everybody men
tioned in the book is dclared guilty
I by someone. The style is like that j
of most English murder stories,
rather Fletcherlike and heavy. For i
the avid detective story fan the
book is a new and interesting prob- I
! lem which, though not logical, is
| equal to most of the detective stories ,
i of today. Now when I was a boy . . . I
I —8.0.8.
