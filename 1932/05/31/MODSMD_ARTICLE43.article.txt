WHEN RALPH METCALF, negro
print sensation of Marquette Uni
ersily, traveled the 220-yard route
n 20.4 seconds the other day, he
v'as traveling right along. He ac
ually traveled faster than did
'rankie Wykoff in setting the un
(Ticial world record of 9.4 .seconds
or the 100-yard dash.
Wykoff's average speed was 31.91
eet per second, while Metcalf left
round behind him at the rate o!
2.35 feet per second. In other
/ords, Metcalf averaged slightly
ver 22 miles per hour on his jaunt,
/bile the best Wykoff could do was
bout 21.7 miles per hour.
Of course, Metcalf s MAXIMUM
peed was quite a bit faster than
hat, inasmuch as it takes the aver
se sprinter about 30 yards to get
p steam. It is very difficult to es
■mate what that maximum burst of
peed might have been, as it varies
really with individual runners.
Some gain their speed by main
lining a fairly even pace through
ut the race, while others put on
ursts at the start or finish. Hec
)yer, for instance, closes with a
•rrific rush which often sweeps him
om a position well back of the
•aders into first place.

A REASONABLE guess is
that Metcalf traversed iiis fast
est 10 yards somewhere en
route at close to 2(5 miles per
hour.
Certain it is that the negro
flash had no opportunity to take
things easy during that rare.
r l'he average good furlong run
ner digs in hard for the first
100 yards, then "drifts" for
about 80 yards, maintaining a
fast pace but storing up energy
for the final spurt, which is
made in the last 40 yards.
Hill Ellington declared last
niglit, however, that any fur
lung run under 21 seconds calls
I' or continuous pressure
throughout. This is a terrific
strain and it takes a super
runner to stand up under it
without actually losing speed.
All of which brings up the
question: NOW who is the
''world's fastest human"? Cer
tainly Metcalf averaged greater
speed in his rate than either
Wykoff in the 100 or Eastman in
the 410.
EVERY ONCE in a while some
ody comes along to say that this
r that record may never be sur
assed, because the "physiological
mit" has been approached oi
cached.
The experts had the shot-putters
I ailed at 48 feet for a long time
ecau.se it was believed that wa. c
bout man's limit. Yet Brix tossed
le pellet out 52 feet, 8% inches
■aturelay night, and there is no par
icular reason to believe that mark
'ill stand forever.
It wasn't so very long ago that 9.C
econds was regarded as the ulti
late performance in the century
•'he adoption of the modern stoj
■atch cut that down to 9.5, but
/Vkoff didn't stop there.
