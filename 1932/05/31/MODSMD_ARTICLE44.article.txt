# Mounted Indians Again Outride Utah Polomen
## CARDS COP FOURTH GAME 8 TO 2 AS HOLT KNOCKS IN 3 Smashing Play Of Spalding, Return Of Lewis Help Card Victory 
### Bill Myers 
Stanford's poloists once more
humbled the University of Utah ;
riders, this time to the tune of 8
to 2, in a lopsided match yesterday
at Salt Lake City.
This was the Cards' fourth con- 1
secutive victory over the Ute riders
this year. Last February the Red- ;
shirts trampled on the Utes in a
two-game series played here. In the j
first of the return series played at :
Salt Lake City last Saturday Utah |
was again downed, but not quite so j
decisively, 9-5.
Utah Threatened
Utah looked dangerous in Satur
day's game, so Coach Dick Gordan
took no chances of having a surprise
win pulled on the Stanford riders.
Pete Lewis was accordingly given
first call in the starting line-up in
place of Gillham. In the first game
Lewis watched from the sidelines
and saw the score become danger
ously close before he was sent in in
the fourth chukker.
Led by McCaskell the Utah outfit
made a strong bid for yesterday's
match. Their offense soon wilted,
though, when the crushing attack
of the Card riders began to click.
Holt Stars
Holt at number one for Stanford
played the best game of his career.
Holt is a second-string player but
managed to score three of the
! Cards' eight goals. Spalding, varsity
; rider, and usually counted on to do
i the bulk of the scoring, hung up
1 one less tally than Holt. Spalding's
\ hard riding more than made up for
his lack of scoring ability, however.
The team returns to the Farm to
' day and will immediately begin
polishing off the rough edges in
! preparation for the match with New
[Mexico Military Institute on Thurs
! day.
The line-ups:
Stanfordâ€” * Utah-
Holt (3) 1 Anderson
Spalding (2) 2 McCaskell (2)
i Melone (1) 3 Walker
i Lewis (2) 4 Ellis
