# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE FINDS KITE, CORBUS IN FIRST-STRING GUARD BERTHS
## 
### MAURICE RAPE 
Spring football practice is rapidly
drawing to a close and the Farm 1
is beginning to wonder just what |
material Coach Pop Warner has un
covered during the eight weeks' j
session and how the team will line j
up next fall.
It can hardly be determined j
whether or not practice has been a j
success; the results of next fall's!
campaign will have to settle that,
but the fact remains that a great j
deal of work has been done. Begin
ning with this article, the Daily will
discuss each day outstanding pros
pects at the various com
mencing with the guards today.
At the start of the season, the left
guard position was a subject of no
little worry to the coaching staff.
True enough, they had Bill Corbus
back to bolster up one side of the

line, but who was to fill the place
! left vacant by such men as Daw
son, Hulen, and Bigelow remained
|an unanswered question.
Now there is a dearth of material
j playing on the various teams. Ted
| Kite has been playing regularly on
| the first squad with Corbus and his
| year's experience on the varsity is
! standing him in good stead. John
j Card, who was a center on the 1931
I squad, is another guard who shows
j promise in practice.
| The goofs contribute Tarver, Mor
| gan, and Gould to the lists, al
t though Morgan, due to an injury,
i has not been working out lately,
i From the freshman eleven come Al
| Semmelroth and Johnnie Mottram,
captain of the 1935 team. Another
new man, Maino, has been playing
regularly with the second squad.
