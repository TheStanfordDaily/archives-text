# IKE HABLES ENDS TRACK CAREER AS ILLNESS TRIUMPHS
## Franich Named As Track Manager To Succeed Ernie Hatch 
### 
j Following closely upon the news ;
that Ben Eastman had been elected j
i Stanford track captain for the 1932-
; 33 season came the information that
j the present Indian leader, fighting
1 Alvin Hables, had ended his Farm
! track career forever.
Hables, who has been out most of
j this season with a series of injuries
| that would be tragically sensational
; had not his brother Les suffered
! from an even more formdiable set,
will undergo an operation to try
and get back his strength as soon
as school is out. Ike will be in no
! condition to run in the P.A.A. meet
| Saturday, and his operation will
i prevent him from competing in the
I 1.C.4-A.'s—thus he is through as a
I Stanford quarter-miler.
j As Hables went out, Tony Franich
I came in yesterday as track fnanager. |
[ Franich defeated Arbuclde, Jonn
j son, Newman, and Henderson in a
I close vote. Franich will succeed Er- \
; nie Hatch, successful manager and
■ beau brummel of the past season, j
Had Varied Career
When Captain Hables was finally
j forced to hang up his shoes yester
day, he ended his Stanford running
I 'in a way that he above all others j
' ! dislikes. Ike came to the Farm as a t
'; sprinter, was converted into a quar- I
| ter-miler by Dink Templeton, and j
! then, although a brilliant 440-man,
, had to spend each of his three years
lof competition running against
3 1 teammates who were just a bit
5 j better.
I'■ In his sophomore year, Hables de- .
* ! feated Ari Woessner and Vic Wil- j
5 | liams among others. Yet most of j
j the time he was taking seconds be
" I hind Johnny Morrison. As a junior, I

Ike ran faster and got. less far, as
the advent of Ben Eastman to the
. Card varsity and the improvement
of Williams forced him farther back
in the scoring column.
In that year, Captain Hables,
along with his brother Les, his suc
cessor, Eastman, and his lead-off
man, Shove, set that great 3:12.(5
j mark in the mile relay. He was
awarded with the captaincy, and
then came the injuries that have
prevented him from being of much
i use to the Indians in a competitive
| way this year.
Eastman, whose election to fill
i Hables' shoes was a foregone con
! elusion, has a record that needs no
| elaboration. The track team realized
j this when Ben received every vote
i but one for the captaincy, that one
| being his own. Incidentally, next
! year will be the third time in six
! years that the Card leader has been
! a quarter-miler: Bud Spencer being
! captain in 1928, Hables in 1932, and
I Eastman in 1933.
