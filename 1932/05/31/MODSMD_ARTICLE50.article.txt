Nordic spear-tossing laurels seem!,
fairly secure for another four years,
because Matti Jarvinen, Finland's
champion javelin-thrower, seems j
I certain to win the Olympic Games
championship at Los Angeles this
summer.
| During a period of one month in j
! 1931, Jarvinen, one of a great fam- j
| ily of Olympic champions, threw ■
; the javelin over 235 feet in five dif- |
i It.rent, meets. His record, which i.s |
I likewise the world standard, is 239 !
j feet, B*2 inches.
Another member of the Finnish
! team, Pettila, will be a strong con
! tender for the world title. He has
! thrown the javelin 223 feet, 9 inches.
Szepes took second for Hungary
; in 1928, and has a mark of 219 feet,
'11 inches to his credit, while
! Sunde's best mark is 222 feet, 5
inches. Kenny Churchill, intercolle- '
i giate champion in 1932, has thrown j

I 22G feet, but has yet to exceed 215
I this year. Churchill suffered his first
I defeat in two years at the Fresno
j Relays, when he lost by a scant
i margin to Jim DeMers, the national
A.A.U. champion.
A1 Ray, Stanford's best javelin
thrower, has not lived up to early
season promise, but is still one of
the twenty or so tossers who is
consistent between 195 and 205 feet.
As a member of this group of dark
horses, Ray can be conceded an
outside chance to at least finish
high among the leaders at the final
Olympic tryouts this summer.
