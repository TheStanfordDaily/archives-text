# LAWYERS HIT U.S. DRY ENFORCENENT AS LEGAL "FARCE"

### 
WASHINGTON, May 30 (A 3 ).â€”
Resolutions, made by the Voluntary
Committee of Lawyers, composed of
national leaders of the legal pro
fession, sarcastically condemn the
situation caused by the Eighteenth
Amendment, in a report made pub
lic today.
President Hoover, as leader of the
Republican party, and Governor
Roosevelt, Alfred E. Smith, Newton
D. Baker, Governor Ritchie of
Baker, Governor Ritchie of Mary
land, John W. Davis and Speaker
Garner, Democratic leaders, were
sent copies of the resolution which,
as a result of four years' study,
sums up the situation in strong
terms.
Demand Party Stands
The committee demands that the
platforms of both the Republican
and Democratic parties make defi
nite statements "either to repeal the
Eighteenth Amendment or to en
force it, without qualifications in
volving vacillation or delay."
Enforcement of the Eighteenth
Amendment has become an out
rageous farce in the opinion of the
lawyers' group in their survey of
the liquor situation from a legal
standpoint.
Law Failure Cited
Summing up their study, the law
yers said: "The direct results of at
tempted enforcement of the Eight
eenth Amendment and acts for its
enforcement have been to imperil
the liberties of the people to finance
organized crime, to plunge politics
in corruption, to clog the courts of
justice, to fill the prisons, and to
subject important communities to
a rule of conduct which they dis
approve and strenuously resist.
