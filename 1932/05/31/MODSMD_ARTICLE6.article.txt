# PACIFIC FLIGHT ENDS IN CRASH
## Browne Injured As Refuel Try Fails 
### 
SEATTLE, May 30. (/P)—Nat C.
Browne's attempt to win a $30,000
prize for the first nonstop flight I
from Seattle to Tokyo failed today j
I when his big red Fokker dropped (
| into the bay just as refueling con- ,
| tact was to be established but the I
! New York aviator and his aide, i
! Frank Brooks, a parachute jumper, j
! were saved.
| The men were landed at the Bal- ,
! lard dock in the north end of town !
j and an ambulance was waiting to j
i rush them to the Ballard Emer- >
! gency Hospital.
Browne's arm was in an impro- |
i vised sling. His face appeared
J drawn as though lie was suffering
pain.
Brooks was laughing as he |
climbed into the ambulance un- j
j aided.
Browne had to leave today in j
j order to reach Tokyo before the j
| prize offer expired June 1. He start- ;
ed yesterday but a broken oil line |
' above Vancouver Island forced him !
j back.
As a last resort, he decided on an
i attempt to take on fuel sufficient
Jto carry him 5000 miles, above i
Seattle.
Browne and his refueling ship j
were about 1800 feet above Puget \
Sound, north of Seattle, when wit- i
! nesses said his plane suddenly fell
! into the water as a refueling con- :
j tact was about to be established, j
Some said the New Yorker's plane j
I fell in flames, while others asserted j
I there was no fire.
