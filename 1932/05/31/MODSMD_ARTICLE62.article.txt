## Manning Shows Importance Of Thyrotron Tube 
### 
Speaking at a joint seminar of the
chemistry and physics departments
yesterday afternoon, Ellis L. Man
j ning of the General Electric Co.
described the new thyrotron tube
| and some of its commercial appli
! cations.
The tube, differing from common
! vacuum tubes chiefly in that it is
partly filled with gas, has a variety
j of uses depending on the type of
! current used on the grid and plate.
It may be used as a relay when
; alternating current is applied to the
! plate and it is useful in this respect
as there are no moving parts to get
out of order and its action is in
stantaneous as there is no inertia
of parts to overcome. When used
with AC. on both pJale grid
the tube has applications as a recti
fier to change direct to alternating
I current or the reverse. For this
| purpose the tubes are generally
i used in pairs. In the future these
j tubes using only two elements may
;be used as a light source for pho
j tographical and other uses. In con
. nection with this Manning also told
i of experiments to find out what ma-
I terial made the best filament for
I vacuum tubes, the best at present
j being one of tungsten coated with
j thorium.
