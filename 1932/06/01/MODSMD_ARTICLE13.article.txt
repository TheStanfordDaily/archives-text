## Orchestra Scores Triumph With Sibelius' Work 
### 
Before an almost full house the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra scored
a musical triumph last night with a
masterful presentation of Sibelius'
stirring First Symphony given for j
the first time in Palo Alto. Under |
the skillful direction of Marguerite |
MacManus this difficult symphony !
was given an expert interpretation.
Noel Walster Sings
The first number, Liszt's Sym- I
phonic Poem, "Les Preludes," might j
be likened to Lowell's immortal j
"Commemoration Ode" in variety of ,
moods and corresponding rhythms, j
all skillfully woven together by a ;
compelling central theme.
Noel Walster's pleasing soprano
voice rendered Leoncavallo's Balla
tella from "Pagliacci." Introduced j
by a few dramatic lines and an in- ;
(cresting and skillfully played or- j
chestration representing the songs i
of various birds, the aria swung into j
a delightfully melodious, lilting song j
with all the sparkling drama of j
Italian opera at its best. I

The last presentation, Sibelius' !
Symphony No. 1 in E minor, Op. 39, 1
began with the searching, minor |
notes of a (lute, introducing a strid- j
ent, challenging movement expres- ;
sive of the fiercer side of the Fin- !
nish temperament, of which this i
symphony is the musical expression, j
Lapsing occasionally into sullenly ;
slow and muted phrases, it would j
then rise with more abandon than !
ever to sweeping harmonies, made j
beautifully moving by the liquid i
notes of the harp.
The Finale miraculously combined j
all the diverse elements of the sym- i
phony into a glorious burst of dra- |
matic music. [
