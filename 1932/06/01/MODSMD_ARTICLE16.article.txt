### 
GENEVA, May 31. (IP)â€”Hugh E.
\ Gibson, American delegate to the
j Disarmament Conference, today
sharply criticized the Conference's
land armament commission for its
inability to arrive at definitions th:it
would draw a line between tanks
and armored cars.
Apparently political considera
tions were dictating the attitudes of
the experts on this question, Gibson
said. The United States considers
armored cars of little military value
and will make a reservation giving
its own definition if the commis
sion's report fails to distinguish be
tween them and tanks.
