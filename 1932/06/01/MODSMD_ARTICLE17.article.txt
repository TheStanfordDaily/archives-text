# Stanford's Endowment Ranks Fifth Nationally

### BOB SCHAUF 
Is Stanford University the most
j richly endowed university in the !
i world? This is the question asked !
; most frequently of Comptroller A. '
lE. Roth.
His answer is "no."
"The fact that Stanford when i
! founded was the most richly en- j
; dowed university, and received so j
! much publicity on this score, no ;
doubt is responsible for the popular j
I misconception that Stanford has at \
Jail times been amply endowed to!
meet its needs," said Roth. "As a I
matter of fact, at all times since its j
founding it has been in great need
of additional funds.
"And the University must expect j
a large part of these additional !
! funds to come in the future from (
the alumni through their class en
dowment subscriptions such as are
I now being sought for by the 1932,
Class Endowment Committee under j
the chairmanship of Bill French." !
There are five other universities i
with larger endowments than Stan-j

ford. Harvard leads with 108 mil
lions. Yale is second with 94 mil
! lions. Columbia has 80 millions;
I Chicago (50 millions; Massachusetts
I Institute of Technology 154 millions;
i and Stanford is sixth with .'50 mil
i lion.
At the time of its founding, Stan
! ford with 21 millions in endowment,
i was the richest of American uni
j versities, its closest riv.il being Hur
| v:ird with 12 millions.
Taking 1000 as a convenient year
j for comparison, Columbia ranked
'third with an endowment of nine
I and one-half millions, while Yale
followed with five millions, and the-
Universily of Chicago had four mil
! Hons.
In the intervening years since
1000, these Eastern universities have
received tremendous additional en
dowments while Stanford has not
fared so well. Since 1000 Stanford's
endowment has increased 43%
while Harvard's increased 823%;
Columbia 900%; Yale 1540%; and
I the endowment of the University of
I Chicago has increased 1340%.
Roth qualifies these figures, by
! pointing out that: "Comparisons by
| total endowment are not final bc
| cause of the variations in enroll
! ment among institutions."
In spite of the fact that Stanford
j enrollment is considered small in
comparison with other ranking uni
; verxities, it stands only twentieth
from the standpoint of endowment
per student. California Institute of
! Technology leads on this basis with
j515,718, whereas Stanford is en-
I dowed with $6,641 per student.

In spite of the fact that Stanford
j enrollment is considered small in
comparison with other ranking uni
; verxities, it stands only twentieth
from the standpoint of endowment
per student. California Institute of
! Technology leads on this basis with
j515,718, whereas Stanford is en-
I dowed with $6,641 per student.
Is Stanford University the most
j richly endowed university in the !
i world? This is the question asked !
; most frequently of Comptroller A. '
lE. Roth.
His answer is "no."
"The fact that Stanford when i
! founded was the most richly en- j
; dowed university, and received so j
! much publicity on this score, no ;
doubt is responsible for the popular j
I misconception that Stanford has at \
Jail times been amply endowed to!
meet its needs," said Roth. "As a I
matter of fact, at all times since its j
founding it has been in great need
of additional funds.
"And the University must expect j
a large part of these additional !
! funds to come in the future from (
the alumni through their class en
dowment subscriptions such as are
I now being sought for by the 1932,
Class Endowment Committee under j
the chairmanship of Bill French." !
There are five other universities i
with larger endowments than Stan-j

ford. Harvard leads with 108 mil
lions. Yale is second with 94 mil
! lions. Columbia has 80 millions;
I Chicago (50 millions; Massachusetts
I Institute of Technology 154 millions;
i and Stanford is sixth with .'50 mil
i lion.
At the time of its founding, Stan
! ford with 21 millions in endowment,
i was the richest of American uni
j versities, its closest riv.il being Hur
| v:ird with 12 millions.
Taking 1000 as a convenient year
j for comparison, Columbia ranked
'third with an endowment of nine
I and one-half millions, while Yale
followed with five millions, and the-
Universily of Chicago had four mil
! Hons.
In the intervening years since
1000, these Eastern universities have
received tremendous additional en
dowments while Stanford has not
fared so well. Since 1000 Stanford's
endowment has increased 43%
while Harvard's increased 823%;
Columbia 900%; Yale 1540%; and
I the endowment of the University of
I Chicago has increased 1340%.
