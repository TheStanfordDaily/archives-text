# Riflemen Display Poor Form In Practice Shoot
## 
### 
Shooting in a high wind and gen
erally poor atmospheric conditions,
ten members of the Rifle Club gave
little evidence of their skill at a
practice shoot held yesterday after
noon at the outdoor range. The best
shooting of the day was done by
Harding, who shot 40 out of a pos
sible 50 when he should have been
shooting 46.
The practice was for the coming
Olympic Games tryouts to be held
next Saturday. On that day also a
qualifying shoot will be held, and
the members of the club will com
pete for the American Legion trophy
cup. Bill Harding and Johnny
Adams will put up the hardest bat
tle for the cup. Harding is its pres
ent holder.
