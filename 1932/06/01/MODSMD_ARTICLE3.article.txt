Today the Quad is out, but

REAL yearbook appears, tlie
QUID. Not quite so funny as
the official recorder of yearly
events, the Quid has the tre
mendous advantage of Hammer
and Coffin's mass production
plan which has made a com
petitive price of 25 cents as
compared to the Quad's six
dollars. You (the purchaser,
you darling) save five dollars
and seventy-five cents and
don't get round shoulders car
rying the handy little informa
tion bulletin about.
This year's book will be radi
cally different from other at
tempts, featuring four corners
and a cover on the back, and
also on ihe front, respectively.
The distribution scheme will
also be a departure next Tues
day, when hordes of screaming
women will wave copies of the
Quid in your mug, whether
you like it or not. Payment
plans are also unique in that
charges will be in installments
of 25 cents each, the same as
the total price, but it looks
keen as blazes when you pay
the easy way.
Chaparral is also very proud
to say that in keeping with
their new advanced policy, the
blessed book will be written
in English. Nifty, what?
