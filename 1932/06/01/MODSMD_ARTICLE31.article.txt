# ALL RHODES LEAD ...

11 is hard l<> understand whv only two members of the!
Stanford "upper ten per cent" have taken the (rouble to
interest themselves in the I!M2 Rhodes scholarships. Here
is the opportunity for profitable study at England's finest
schools, all prepaid and with honor due, and such is the;
response. At Stanford, where the very surroundings are!
said to facilitate the highest order of ability and intelli-l
genee, such is the concerted responseâ€”two people.
Especially is the apparent lack of interest lamentable j
since one of the Rhodes scholars last named in this district
is a Stanford man a man whose highly meritorious rec
ord can be found repeated in probably a dozen or more
cases 011 the campus.
Although the scholarships will not be awarded until
tile first of autumn quarter, material must be prepared far
m advance, and it will soon be 100 late even to make the
beginning attempt at application. The two 19.'i2 awards for
this California district, unless a few more persons show a
hurried interest, will he given a large, large chance to go I
off and rest on other than Stanford shoulders a foolish
and unnecessary thing at best.
