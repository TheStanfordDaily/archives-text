Willi the successful performance last night of 1 lie Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra, the musical season of the (lam
pus was biought lo a close for those of us who are not
attending the Summer Quarter. A sympathetic audience
showed its approval of the hard work which the orches
lra had put in under the able leadership of Marguerite
MacManus to produce so finished a concert.
Last night's presentation marked one more milestone
on the cultural highway Stanford has been traveling (lur
ing the last few years. Progress along the "highway" has
not been 100 smooth, it is true. However, Ihc A.S.S.U.'s
decision lo maintain the C.onccrl Series gave a very good
indication thai the "rough" is not insensible lo the benefits
of cultural advantages. This decision of the A.S.S.U.'s,
coupled with the support of the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra, should quid any of those calamity howlers who
have maintained that there is no place on the Campus for
pcelv cultural pursuits.
