# BULL SESSION
## DIGITS RELATIVE TO THE BALL 
### 
Figures are boring. Why quote ]
them to those who are in the senior
saddle? These ruthless riders of the
students' pocketbooks already know
them. It is they that prepared the
budget from which the lolluwing
figures are derived. They are de
termined to ride up the steep hill
of splendid splurges—even though
1 the horse upon which they have se
curely fastened themselves groans
land sweats—hesitates and ialters
under the staggering load.
i
Up the ten dollar heights, these
generous knights of O.P.M. (Other
, People's Money) charge. What mut
ter if the horse attempts to rest at,
the eight dollar stall? What matters
, it if in the year of depression, the
i poor students want a rest? All that |
i the gallant gauchos of ihe class need
j do is to apply the cutting spurs of |
j power and the stinging whip of of
-1 ficial stupidity and stubbornness — j
; and they feel sure that their plug- '
' ging mount will be forced on.
Startlingly outrageous does the
whole affair become when one
, studies their budget. They have al
; ready committed themselves to |
about $500 for favors and so noth- 1
ing can be done on that score. They I
i can spend no more than $500 for j
I music according to sensible limita- i
Lions put down by A1 Denny; and i
; as music makes a dance, let us leave i
i that figure where it is. It is high j
I enough when we consider that both
j Hal Grayson and Carol Lol'ner I
played on the campus for less.
.! The biggest cut can come in the
'senior breakfast. With dinners sell

| ing for fifty cents in Palo Alto, we
can easily expect that breakfasts
j bought in wholesale lots should run
I no more. With 245 bids planned for
the dance, breakfasts for 490 indi
viduals should be available for $245
or a cut of $255 from the estimated
! figure.
The second major cut can come
|in lighting and decorations. The
Toyon Hall by plan or divine guid
ance was made for dances. The less
i decorations to mar its beautiful
| simplicity the better. The last Toyon
dance was completely decorated and
; lighted for $25. Allow the boys three
times this figure or $75 and we have
i a saving of a full $175 from their
estimated figure.
Then finally, the Terrible Tsars
of class finance have allowed a
("margin" of $140 in excess of a $100
J miscellaneous sum. That might be
inecessary with bids at $10 to allow
for the failure to sell the full quota.
At eight dollars, this danger would
be greatly mitigated, and this mar
gin could be killed.
Adding up we find that a saving
I of $255 in breakfast, $175 in decora
j tions, and $140 in unnecessary mar-
I gin makes a net saving of $570 —
| more than enough to reduce the
| bids to eight dollars. In fact, the
j bids could be cut by two dollars
I with only a saving of $440. We are
j not attempting to spike the Senior
! Ball. It can still be a grand affair,
j the best of the year, and something
i worth remembering at this reduced
! price which will not cut the quality
of the orchestra, the favors, or the
programs. —Abe Mellinkoff

Startlingly outrageous does the

.! The biggest cut can come in the
'senior breakfast. With dinners sell

can easily expect that breakfasts
j bought in wholesale lots should run
I no more. With 245 bids planned for
the dance, breakfasts for 490 indi
viduals should be available for $245
or a cut of $255 from the estimated
! figure.
The second major cut can come
|in lighting and decorations. The
Toyon Hall by plan or divine guid
ance was made for dances. The less
i decorations to mar its beautiful
| simplicity the better. The last Toyon
dance was completely decorated and
; lighted for $25. Allow the boys three
times this figure or $75 and we have
i a saving of a full $175 from their
estimated figure.
Then finally, the Terrible Tsars
of class finance have allowed a
("margin" of $140 in excess of a $100
J miscellaneous sum. That might be
inecessary with bids at $10 to allow
for the failure to sell the full quota.
At eight dollars, this danger would
be greatly mitigated, and this mar
gin could be killed.
Adding up we find that a saving
I of $255 in breakfast, $175 in decora
j tions, and $140 in unnecessary mar-
I gin makes a net saving of $570 —
| more than enough to reduce the
| bids to eight dollars. In fact, the
j bids could be cut by two dollars
I with only a saving of $440. We are
j not attempting to spike the Senior
! Ball. It can still be a grand affair,
j the best of the year, and something
i worth remembering at this reduced
! price which will not cut the quality
of the orchestra, the favors, or the
programs. —Abe Mellinkoff
Figures are boring. Why quote ]
them to those who are in the senior

them. It is they that prepared the

termined to ride up the steep hill
of splendid splurges—even though
