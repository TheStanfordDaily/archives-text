ONE HUNDRED YEARS IN YO
i SEMITE. By Carl P. Russell
(Stanford University Press).
"One Hundred Years in Yosemite"

; cent publication of the Stanford
i University Press. The book is a his
tory of the whole Yosemite region
! since the discovery of the Yosemite
| Valley. Carl P. Russell, the author,
is a field naturalist in the National
Park Service and is unusually ca
; pable of writing on ihe subject. Ho
1 livens the events following the dis-
I covery of the Valley with tales of
' striking and influential persons of
the region. His story gives a section
. of the early history of the Ameri
j cans in California. Anyone inter
| ested in the history of the West
j would enjoy reading this book.

JUST TO REMIND YOU. By Owen
Davis. Farrar and Rinehart. $2.
Since "Icebound" and the Pulit
zer Prize awarded it, Owen Davis
has, at intervals, donned the profes
sorial whiskers and shaken a stubby
finger at something or other very,
very bad.
In "Just to Remind You" the ob
ject of his worry is the hoodlum
and our nation's current state.
Jimmie is starting a laundry and
when approached by a gentleman
offering protection, idealistically
knocks him down and calls in the
police. Jimmie Ls thereafter pound
ed, his laundry blown up, and in a
final scene — ironic flagwavings,
somewhat overfamiliarly inserted by
author Davis —slain.
Davis Ls a good melodramatist—
but sentimentalizes his protesting
tragedy until it appears to be no
more than "The Perils of China
town" gone wrong at the final cur
tain.

Davis' hero, instead of appearing
a courageous, idealistic, martyred
American, impresses me—who may
be a coward at heart but who does,
strangely enough, prefer life to an
ideal —as being a rather thick-head
cd blunderer. Davis overstates his
case for the purpose of pointing his
moral; but in doing so is discon
certing to an unfortunately great
degree.
He has tried to be honest and
straightforward, but his years of
melodramatics have lifted him from
realism and set him down some
where in a land where everyone is
either good-hearted or a conscience
less hound. His characters are, in
short, unreal. This particular play is
as unimportant as the rest, an in
dication that a gentleman who once
wrote entertaining thrillers has
merely gone to pleading causes.

JUST TO REMIND YOU. By Owen
Davis. Farrar and Rinehart. $2.
Since "Icebound" and the Pulit
zer Prize awarded it, Owen Davis
has, at intervals, donned the profes
sorial whiskers and shaken a stubby
finger at something or other very,
very bad.
In "Just to Remind You" the ob
ject of his worry is the hoodlum
and our nation's current state.
Jimmie is starting a laundry and
when approached by a gentleman
offering protection, idealistically
knocks him down and calls in the
police. Jimmie Ls thereafter pound
ed, his laundry blown up, and in a
final scene — ironic flagwavings,
somewhat overfamiliarly inserted by
author Davis —slain.
Davis Ls a good melodramatist—
but sentimentalizes his protesting
tragedy until it appears to be no
more than "The Perils of China
town" gone wrong at the final cur
tain.

Davis' hero, instead of appearing
a courageous, idealistic, martyred
American, impresses me—who may
be a coward at heart but who does,
strangely enough, prefer life to an
ideal —as being a rather thick-head
cd blunderer. Davis overstates his
case for the purpose of pointing his
moral; but in doing so is discon
certing to an unfortunately great
degree.
He has tried to be honest and
straightforward, but his years of
melodramatics have lifted him from
realism and set him down some
where in a land where everyone is
either good-hearted or a conscience
less hound. His characters are, in
short, unreal. This particular play is
as unimportant as the rest, an in
dication that a gentleman who once
wrote entertaining thrillers has
merely gone to pleading causes.
