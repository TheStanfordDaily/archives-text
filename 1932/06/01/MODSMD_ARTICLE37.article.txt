## MORE SENIOR BALL 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday's Bull Session and the
J editorial concerning the Senior Ball
: seemed to arrive at a proper con
-1 elusion, in spite of their omission of
I a most important point. That is, that
la two-dollar cut in the price of tick
ets will NOT DETRACT FROM THE
i QUALITY OF THE DANCE.
| The present budget totals $2200.
I From that can be deducted:
j $100 for the orchestra . . . and
still have good music,
$125 for the supper . . . and still
i enjoy a supper equal in price
and quality to that of last year,
$100 for decorations . . . and keep
the full beauty of Toyon lobby
and the court without the use
of the usual horrible drapery.
This was well demonstrated by
the Toyon Sport Dance,
j Further consideration should be
taken of the $140 surplus in the
i present budget. Add this to the sug
! gested deductions, subtract the total
i from the $2200 planned, the result
jis $1735 (even to a journalism ma
jor), which expense can be covered
jby 220 bids sold at eight dollars
j each. Space prevents further like
! suggestions, but it is my conviction
j that the dance, if the committee
j controls the temptation to exceed
past Senior balls, will hold up in
! quality even if the tickets are low
j ered in price. Sincerely,
Tom Aitken
