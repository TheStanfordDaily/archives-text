# EHRHORN'S BERTH TO BE FILLED BY BIG ED LETTUNICH
## Palamountain Also Slated For Regular Varsity Tackle Post 
### Maurice Rapf 
Who's going to fill Chuck Ehr
horn's place at left tackle?
This little question didn't seem so
little to Coach Pop Warner as the
end of last football season rolled
around and he found his outstand- I
ing tackle on the graduating list, j
Tackles are an important part of
i.ny Warner-coached team and Ehr
horn was just the kind of man that 1
fitted into a Warner attack, so it
isn't hard to see that his gradua
tion would leave a big question- |
mark at left tackle. But now that |
spring practice is almost over, this j
question has been practically an- !
swered, and the answer comes in
the person of big Ed Lettunich, an
oversized individual who got his
early training on the freshman out
fit last fall. I
Palamountain Plays
Tall, rangy, and aggressive, this
first-year man has stepped into a
position which asked a great deal
of him and has delivered plenty, j
with the result that he is playing!
regularly on the first string, with
Ben Palamountain on the other side
of the line. Ben is another power
fully built fellow who was a mem
ber of the varsity squad last year.
The work of these two men has
been good enough to shove Chuck ,
Prelsnik, a letterman, to the second
team. Rogers, a transfer from Menlo, \
has been Prelsnik's teammate. Two
other tackles who have been per- '
forming well are Holwerda and
Killer.
Trackmen to Come
When the track team disbands,
George Grey, Nellie Gray, and Here
Laßorde will add their names to
the tackle roster and should
strengthen the outlook considerably.
Inasmuch as three of the regular
ends, Colvin, Doub, and Tod, from
last year's squad, are back for com- i
petition, the wings are pretty well
fortified, although there have ad
mittedly been no outstanding pros
pects uncovered in the present ,
practice session.
Jay Tod, only one of the trio in !
school at the present time, has been
the outstanding end on the field in
ill of the scrimmages. He is playing :
the same aggressive type of ball that '
sarned him a first-string berth last
fall.
More Ends
Red Buchanan, a transfer from
Bakersficld, has been on the first
squad during the last few weeks, i
although Thorny Rogers held this
post for some time. Numerous in
juries have handicapped Rogers
lately.
Hugh Miller, who hails from the
3oof squad, has also been receiving,,
some attention, as have Gillespie, i
Kahn, and Philippi. All in all, the I
•rids seem to be well taken care of. I
It is at center, however, that the
most material is available, inas
much as three men are battling for
fhe first-string honors and another ;
pair isn't far behind.
Blanchard, Albertson, and Bill
Bates have been alternating on the
first team, with all three men show
ing about equal ability, but Kant
ser, from the goofs, and Bill's broth
er, Chuck Bates, are also capable :
ball-handlers.
