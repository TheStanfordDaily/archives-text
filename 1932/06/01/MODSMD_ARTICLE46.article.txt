COACII "KY" EBRIGIIT sent j
his California Golden Bear crew
through its first four-mile race
yesterday against time, in pre
paration for the Poughkeepsie j
regatta which they row about i
the same time that the West is
trying to outdo the East in the
1.C.4-A. track meet.
What time they made is not im- I
portant, because the dynamic little j
mentor never thinks he has his best |
crew on the water until the race is j
over, but when the final results \
come over the wires you will find I
that "Ky" has turned out another |
fighting crew that had the East j
shaking in its collective boots.
This year's outfit will have one j
eye slanted at the powerful Syra
cuse eight, which last year defeated
the Bear junior varsity. Most of
these varsity members rowed in J
those junior varsities last year.
Harry Maloney has a varsity
soccer squad out this spring; that
gives promise of a winning team
next fall. And when we say
winning we mean one that will
perhaps surpass the fine record
hung up by this year's aggrega
tion. There are about four teams
on the field every afternoon, and
out of these four teams, trans
fers, and some who arc not out
now will come the 1!)1!2 varsity
eleven.
One of the most encouraging
things about the spring practice is
that nine of last fall's freshman nu
meral winners are on the first two |
teams. And there are plenty of j
sophomores and juniors to make the
going interesting. In addition there
is the possibility that San Mateo's
all-conference fullback, Lane, is
coming to the, Farm in the fall.
From Los Angeles comes (he
news that Charlie Paddock,
Duke of Montenegro, and once
the "world's fastest human,"
having been given another
A.A.U. card is training for his
fourth Olymyic team. Jackson
V. Scholtz is the only other
sprinter to have made three of
your Uncle Sammy's track
teams. If Sir Charles gets back
into any sort of training, he is
going to make the youngsters j
step. That broad-jump finish of

his has nipped more than one
seeming winner at the tape!
And. speaking of boys who ram
ble, Blazin' Ben is going after the
SOO-meter mark in the P.AA. meet,
as well as his own unofficial 880-
yard record, this week-end.
The city papers seem to feel
that Pen Ilallowell of Harvard
is not so fast in the mile merely
because he ran 4:12 indoors. But
if you ask us he is going to be
in their at the head of the pack
when the timers shut down at
the end of the 1.C.4-A. mile run.
He is tall and rangy, has a good
sprint, knows his race, and has
a good deal of the old "intestinal
fortitude."
It is certainly too bad the Middle
west doesn't compete in this inter
collegiate classic. But they will be
much in evidence in the Olympics
so why worry? â€”Bob Wade
