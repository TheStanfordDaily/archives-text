# KNECHT COPS FINAL TILT IN GOLF PLAY FOR NOVICE CROWN
## 
### 
Gus Knecht had a six-hole start!
J when he stepped on the first tee i
| yesterday to play his match with j
j Joe Graves in the finals of the ;
J novice golf tournament, but Gus
I didn't need his six-hole handicap j
i yesterday and proceeded to win the
| match five up on the 14th green.
Things looked pretty bad for
! Knecht at the very outset, with j
\ Graves winning the first four holes ;
j to cut the lead to only two up, but
!Gus began to sink putts after that— j
i putts from any distance. It was too
| much for Graves to overcome and
i Knecht proceeded to take the match
!in his own hands from that point
i on, winning the next two holes, and
j then taking the 10th, 13th, and 14th. j
| The scores for the first nine:
j Par 5-4-3-4-4-4-5-3-4—36
j Knecht 6-5-4-5-5-4-5-3-5—42
• Graves 4-4-3-4-6-5-4-3-5—38
