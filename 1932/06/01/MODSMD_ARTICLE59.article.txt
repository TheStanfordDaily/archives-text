# MASSIE RESTORED TO CITIZENSHIP BY GOVERNOR'S EDICT
## Kentucky Executive Claims Killer's Civil Rights Not Impaired 
### 
FRANKFORT, Ky„ May 31. (/P> —
Lieutenant Thomas H. Massie was j
restored to full citizenship in an j
order issued here today by Cover- j
nor Ruby Laffoon.
The naval lieutenant, who with
his mother-in-law, Mrs. Granville j
Fortescue and two sailors, was con- i
victed last month in Honolulu of j
manslaughter, is a native of Win- I
chester, Ky. The sentences of the i
four for the "honor slaying" of a j
Hawaiian indicted for attacking j
Mrs. Massie, were commuted to an i
hour in jail.
The Governor's order, issued on
the regular form for restoring civil
rights, carried a notation saying:
"The question has been raised as
lo whether by reason of said con
viction, said Massie, who is a citizen
of the State of Kentucky, lost his j
civil rights, as such citizen under j
the laws of this commonwealth, and
while it is believed said conviction
had no such effect in any respect,
yet, in order to put the matter be
yond all doubt, his civil rights, if
they were denied, are restored to
him."
