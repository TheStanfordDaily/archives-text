### 
AUTEUIL, France, May 31. (/Pi-
Mrs. Helen Wills Moody and Sidney
Wood, Jr., of the United States were
defeated in the finals of mixed
doubles in the French tennis cham
pionships today by the English pair,
Betty Nuthall and Frederick Perry.
The scores were 6-4, 6-2.
Wood, fatigued from the five-set
singles match earlier in the day in
which he was defeated by Rene
Lacoste, Franch Davis Cup veteran,
was able to offer Mrs. Moody but
little support. Perry, British Davis
Cup ace, played brilliantly for the
winners.
The defeat ruined Queen Helen's
chances of making a clean sweep of
the three divisions of the tourna
ment for which she is eligible.
