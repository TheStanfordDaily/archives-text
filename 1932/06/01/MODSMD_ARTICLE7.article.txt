# ONE CENT LEVY ON GAS OKEHED IN BUDGET BILL
## Solons Reject President's Plea To Include Tax On Manufactures 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 31. (/P) —
! The Senate built the revenue bill
!up to a budget balancing level to
! day with a tax of 1 cent a gallon
| on gasoline. The committee amend
! ment proposing the gasoline tax was
adopted without a record vote after
; the Senate had rejected an amend
i ment by Senator Gore, Oklahoma,
| to reduce the tax to one-half a cent.
In one of its most impressive
' post-war sessions, the Senate re
j promptly today to a dra
; matic personal appeal from Presi
i dent Hoover for new taxes and
i quick enactment of the revenue bill,
ignore Sales Tax Plea
An eleventh-hour endorsement of
I r general manufacturers' excise tax,
i voiced by the chief executive, was
' ignored, however, and the Senate
| forged ahead with the bulging bill
i seeking other levies to meet the
chief executive's demand for new
taxes and hoping for a final vote
j before adjournment tonight.
The gasoline tax went in without
j even a recorded vote after the Sen
j ate had overturned its finance com
i mittee in a last rebellious gesture
: to knock out a recommendation for
a consumer's tax on gas and elcc
| tricity.
Income Tax Boosted
The other $70,000,000 in additional
! revenue which Secretary Mills early
I in the day told the finance committee
1 was needed to meet a shrinkage in
estimates was gained by another
| boost in the income rates.
Mr. Hoover spoke apprehensively
! of further delay in enactment of the
| bill and said fears and doubts of the
determination of Congress to balance
I the budget has been "foolishly ex
! aggeratcd" in foreign countries, re
j suiting in a persistent attack on the
J American dollar.
No Adjournment Until Vote
The Senate went ahead with a
will for a quick finish of the gruel
ling tax-raising job late in the day
j and abandoned all plans for ad
journment until the greatest peace
time revenue bill was passed.
With all the tax rate schedules
acted upon by dinner time tonight,
[ the Senate amid shouts of "vote,
vole" took up a score of pending in
dividual amendments. These were
either shouted down or accepted by
the leaders as the end of the fight
was eagerly sought.
