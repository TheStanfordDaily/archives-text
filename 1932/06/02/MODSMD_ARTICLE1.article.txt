# INDIANS ENTER FULL STRENGTH IN P.O. MEET
## Cardinals, Olympic Club, Favored For Team Championship BIG BEN AFTER SECOND Eastman Runs 1:52.1; To Attack 800 Meter Mark 
### Dick Strouse 
If Stanford's intellectual track
men don't become dismayed, wor
ried, and flabbergasted at the idea
of running meter races instead of
their own accustomed yard races
Saturday, they should win the an
nual P.A.A. track meet at Kezar
Stadium from the Olympic Club.
There is a chance, of course, that
the Indians will stop in the middle
of their respective races to ponder
and deliberate upon how much
shorter is 1500 meters than a mile,
but all should go well if they rely
on their feet instead of their brains.
Because all the events will be of
Olympic Games distances, Ben East
man, ace, captain-elect, star, and
big shot of the Cardinal forces, will
be found in the 800-meter run in
stead of the 880-yard sprint. But
Eastman figures to fool the crowd.
He will try to break the world's 800-
meter record and then will prob
ably have another tape put up at the
880-yard mark and lower his own
record in that race as well.
Eastman's Method
Whatever the distance or dis
tances, Eastman will use the old
Eastman method of winning races
and breaking records. He will
simply run as fast —or nearly as fast
—as he can and keep on running
until the tape arrives and gently
brushes his chest.
In preparation for Saturday's ef
fort, Ben ran an ordinary American
half-mile in 1:52:1 yesterday. As
usual, he made it look easy, and al
though ticing up slightly going
around the last turn, he came out
of it to sprint to the finish.
Hahlcs Will Run
Lcs Hables, who was down and
out but who is now up and in, will
also be seen in the P.A.A.'s. Les will
again buck Bob Kiesel and his own
weakened condition in the same
races, as he plans to compete un
attached in the 100-meter and per
haps the 200-meter dashes. Hables
says he is feeling fine, which is good
Stanford 1.C.4-A. news.
Being of an ambitious if not fool
hardy nature, Jim Ferric and Art
Azevedo have entered the 300-
meter steeplechase, which is a
touch-and-out affair: you touch one
of the numerous hazards, fall on
your nose, and are out. These two,
along with Bob Atkinson, have also
entered the 1500-meter run, while
Amdahl and Acbersold will race.
5000 meters.
Something New For Herbert
Cotto Herbert will appear in the
400-meter hurdles, which are a com
bination of high and low hurdle
flights and a 440. Herbert ran a
quarter in 52 seconds yesterday in
preparation. Meier, Burgman, and
Stallings will try not to mix up their
steps in the 110-meter highs.
No less than four high-jumpers
will be furnished free transportation
to Kezar. They include Penny Aus
tin, Don Blackman, and Bob Keeble
of the varsity, and freshman Lloyd
Schween, who will compete unat
tached. Wally Butler. Phil Williams,
and Bill Willard are all entered in
the broad-jump, but Butler may not
compete.
