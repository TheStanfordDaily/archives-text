# BALL REPORT
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Following its re
fnsial to answer a petition request
ing an $K dance, the Senior Ball
Committee explains its reason lor
retaining a $10.00 hall hid.)
In view of the present agitation
for a cheapened Senior Ball, the
committee presents its opinion on the
question. We feel that the class in
signing the petitions circulated by
Mr. Mellinkoff, et. al., expressed a
belief that for eight dollars they are
still going to receive ten dollars
worth of "Senior Ball." But such is
not the case.
The figures and opinions of Mr.
Mellinkoff, and others, who have
discussed this matter, have largely
been based on the figures from the
Toyon Sport Dance, an informal, and
the Junior Prom, a formal. How
ever, neither of these dances fea
tured the favors and breakfast,
which have been traditional with the
Senior Ball.
Dance Later*
A further point to be considered
is that at the Senior Ball dancing
lasts from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.,
whereas the other campus dances
last from 9:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m.
The six hours of dancing, half again
as much as any other dance, makes
it necessary to pay orchestras more.
And the only acceptable orchestras
have bid five hundred dollars for
the evening (or morning). In view
of this, it is only natural to assume
that more elaborate preparations are
necessary.
Reductions Considered
The suggestions for reductions in
expenditures have all been con
sidered by the committee, but the
bids received to date show that it
is impossible to follow these sug
gestions. "The biggest cut can come
in the senior breakfast"—but, un
fortunately, this is impossible. The
caterers who are equipped to handle
such an undertaking have all sub
mitted minimum bids of seventy-five
cents per plate, which means a dol
lar and a half a bid, and with over
five hundred people to serve, this
single item amounts to approxi
mately four hundred dollai's.
In the matter of lighting, the Sen
ior Ball is confronted with the prob
lem of renting everything, whereas,
the Toyon Informal, used for com
parison, was lighted with equipment
owned by the Toyon Club.
The "margin" of §140.00 is only a
safe-guard, because of the depleted
condition of the class treasury,
which necessitates budgeting the
the Ball on a sound business basis.
Further, be it undei'stood, that the
committee, entrusted with the han
dling of this Ball, is working for the
good of the Senior Class, and is en
deavoring to present a parting Ball
which the members of the Senior
Class will remember as a crowning
event of four years at college.
