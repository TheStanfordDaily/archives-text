# 1932 Quad Sets Record In Year Book Distinction
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Bound in a distinctive new sand
colored linen cover, the 1932 Quad
| made its bow to a waiting student
| body yesterday afternoon.
Keeping up the tradition that each
suceeding yearbook shall excel the
: previous ones, Volume 30 combines
; the excellencies of its predecessors
with an originality which sets a
i high standard for future issues.
Thomas Aitken, editor, introduced
into hi? book several now features
; which form a definite addition. The
I section honoring the life and work
j of David Starr Jordan is a worthy
i tribute to the great First President.
The "Olympiad'' .section, respect
fully dedicated to Eric Krenz, is an
interesting account of Stanford's
I Olympic hi.story, past and present.
The main-division pages, done
i after the manner of Rockwell Kent,
portray an idealized Stanford stu
i dent stepping through the college
year. The sub-divisions are master-
I pieces of photographic art and de
pict scenes dear to the heart of a
Farm-dweller. Another feature of

I the artistic end of the book is cari
catures by Harold Helvenston (in
cluding one of H.H.) at the end of
i subdivisions.
The life section departs from the
usual in having several pages de
voted to stills of the campus in
flower, with cloud effects and at
! night time. The chronological snap
; shots of odds an dends, however,
' are rather disjointed and hard to
distinguish, being hampered by
: somewhat incoherent verse.
The razz section has the true ash
-1 man's touch, digging up the plenti
; ful campus dirt with far more
I frankness and finesse than any re
| cent Quad. The drama section, too,
is noticeable for its almost, harsh
I criticism, justifiably so or not.
And throughout the whole, a
| rather pleasing lavender glow suf
-1 fuses the pages, casting a soothing
effect on the reader. The average
| Quad is one to be glanced at,
i skimmed through and, finally, care
j fully perused. The '32 Quad is of a
i caliber to make one devour it al
| most at one sitting.
