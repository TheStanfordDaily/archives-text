# CLASS OF 1932 PETITIONS FOR $8 DANCE BIDS
## Ball Officials Refuse To Meet Demand Of 216 Plea Signers 
### 
Refusing to be deterred from their
original course in the face of a pe
tition bearing the names of 21G
registered seniors, the '32 Ball Com
mittee met and failed to ratify the
proposal to reduce bids to $8.
The circular which was headed
"An Open Letter and Petition to
Jack Tarr—President of the Senior
Class" requested that Senior Ball
bids be reduced $2. The "unprece
dented depression" and the belief
that an "adequate and creditable"
Ball could be presented with $8
bids were the two reasons named
in the petition for requesting low
ered bids.
Appearing yesterday morning, the
petitions had soon accumulated over
200 names. The seniors who signed
