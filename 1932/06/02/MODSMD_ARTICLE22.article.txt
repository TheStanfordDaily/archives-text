# FARMLAND MENACED BY FLOOD IN SOUTH
## 
### 
BLYTHE. June 1. </P)â€”A crest of
water raged down the silt-covered
bed of the Colorado river today,
punching holes in weakened levees
and endangering farm lands. The
damage was negligible.
Thirty-one miles to the southwest,
the currents cut another gash in a
levee, but no dirt was available to
plug the hole. The river flooded
several thousand acres, most of it
brush land.
