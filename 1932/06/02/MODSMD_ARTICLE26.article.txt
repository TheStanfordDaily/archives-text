BERLIN, June 1. (/P) —A Cabinet
crammed with ennobled aristocrats j
and devoid of parliamentarians or'
representatives of organized labor
was formed tonight under Franz j
von Papen.
There is not a lieutenant of Adolph |
Hitler in the new administration,
but President Paul von Hindenburg,
Hitler, and General von Schleicher
t.re authoritatively reported as see- ;
ing eye to eye.
Il became virtually certain tonight,
that the first act of the new govern
ment would be to dissolve the !
Reichstag.
The Socialists also belong to the j
indicated opposition, and among
these three parties there are 2.10 ,
votes, only 54 short of the number j
necessary to overthrow the Govern
ment. Political commentators said i
the 54 votes would be obtainable
easily from other groups.
WASHINGTON. June 1. (/P)— I The
House today passed the Dickstein
bill to admit alien fathers and!
mothers of American citizens into
this country. The bill gives the par
ents this special preference for one
year.
