# FACTS NOW ACTION

Several seniors yesterday afternoon drafted a petition
to cut the price of Senior Ball bids to eight dollars; they
circulated it for a few hours among members of their class;
the long list of names printed in today's Daily is the result.
No one can deny the weight so many signatures carry.
Nor can anyone complain that the total does not approach
a majority, and therefore cannot he taken as a representa
tive voice. This because the handlers of the petition report
that those approached who refused to sign were few
enough to count on the fingers of one hand.
The obvious argument of the person who discounts the
result is that anyone asked to sign something that will save
him money will do so without weighing the consequences.
Foreseen by the backers of the price cut, this objection was
precluded by a careful presentation of the facts proving
that the slash would not impair seriously the staging of an
affair worthy of the name "Senior Ball."
Given time, the petition would undoubtedly attract
signatures of a large majority of the class. But an indica-
tion of what the seniors want was needed immediately, that
the committee might act promptly.
Now that it knows definitely that its class wants a Senior
Ball at eight dollars per bid, will the committee heed this
expressed wish and make the price cut?
