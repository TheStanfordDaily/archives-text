Several seniors yesterday afternoon drafted a petition
t ( » eut the price of Senior Hall bids to eight dollars; they
circulated it for a lew hours among members of their class;
the. long l ,s ' "I names printed in today's Daily is the result.
No one can deny the weight so many signatures carry.
Nor can anyone complain that the total does not approach
a majority, and therefore cannot he taken as a representa
tive voice, i his because the handlers of the petition report
that those approached who refused to sign were few,
enough to count on the lingers of one band.
1 he obvious argument of the person who discounts the
result is that anyone asked to sign something that will save
him money ill do so without weighing the consequences,
foreseen by ihe backers of the 1 price cut, this objection was 1
precluded by a careful presentation of the facts proving
that the slash would not impair seriously the staging of an
affair worthy of Ihe name "Senior Hall."
(liven lime, the petition, would undoubtedly attract
signatures ol a large majority of the class. Hut an indica-'
tion of what the seniors want was needed immediately, that
the committee might act promptly.
Now that it knows definitely that its class wants a Senior
Hall at eight dollars per bid, will the committee heed this
expressed wish and make the price cut?
