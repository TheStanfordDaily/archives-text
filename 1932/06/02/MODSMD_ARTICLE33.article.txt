# AGAIN THE HONOR CODE
## 
### 
I lie petition concerning t lie* Honor (lode, run in yes to r
(lny's issue of the Daii.v, contains three ideas that are op
posed to the present working of the (lode and, it' the re
vision is ell'octcd. would lie detrimental to its spirit and
success.
First, the petition calls for an Honor Council consisting
of both student and faculty members, t iider the present
plan violators of the (.ode are tried by the. Men's and
Women's Councils with the President of the I nivcrsity
checking their decisions.
The student councils have admirably performed their
(unctions (his year and there is no need to turn over this
part of student government to the facility when the students
have shown themselves capable of handling it themselves.
Secondly, the proposed revision demands that the ac
cused he confronted in court by his accuser. Although this
is iu accordance with accepted legal procedure, students
would be loath to report violations, know ing that they must
appear at the trial. I! is still diflicult to get students to turn
in observed violations and an\ plan which will cause,
further hesitation is a large stone in the already rocky;
path toward the complete success of the Code, when all :
students sluill regard cheating as a crime meriting punish
ment.
Lastly, the petition stales that the name of the accused j
shall be withheld from publication. True, at present the!
names are not announced, because the campus is not yet
honor-conscious to a degree making a man convicted de- 1
serving of the further penalty of publicity. However, if
students come to look upon cheaters as a breed not to be
tolerated, then the publication of the names of violators i
would be a justified and not 100 severe punishment.
