### 
The relatively Iu"<4h esteem in which financiers hold the
intelligence of President Hoover as compared with that of
Congress was strikiiii*lv demonstrated Tuesday during the
, . k I
President's attempt to push the manufacturers sales tax*
Ihrough the Senate.
Stock market quotations fell steadily early in the day
while the upper house floundered in futile efforts to bal
ance the budget. When news of Hoover's visit to Capitol
I [ill to urge passage of the sales tax measure became pub
lit the mat k< I rallied sharply, only to fall away in very
definite fa hion as it was learned that the Senate had de
feated the hill.
Hoover himself does not believe the manufactures tax
is the liesl means of raising revenue to balance the budget.
Ilul he did consider it the best measure that could be gotten
through a disorganized and lcadcrless Congress.
Evidently the best financial brains in the country, wliosc 1
views are expressed in the dollars and cents prices of I
slocks and produce, agreed with the chief executive. They
tell reasonably certain that whatever the President pro
poses would Im■ workable, at least, but they felt no such
assurance in regard to the possible brain-storms of the
legislative branch. II is Ihis sort of feeling that is rapidly
undermining the opponents of Hoover's re-election and
that makes 'tis triumph next fall increasingly probable.
