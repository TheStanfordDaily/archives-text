# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
A little (five-worded) question |
has arisen. It reads: "Why write
about the ball?" It is evident that
mere words cannot shake loose the j
death hold that the Dance Com
mittee and the President have on
the Class treasury and the Senior
Ball. If this small group is deter
mined to stand out against major- i
ity sentiment —and what is more j
important, if this minute minority :
is willing to stand out against the j
compelling demands of the cold [
figures—then there is nothing that !
can be done.
I! this infinitesimal fraction of the
Senior Class wishes to blindfold
itself to the many evident ways in
which the Ball Budget can be
shaved—without impairing the in- J
herent quality of the dance, the rest i
of the class—the bid-buyers that is— i
must suffer. Nothing can be done j
legally to pry off the self-imposed
blindfolds and make the committee
see that great cuts can be made in j
decorations, and breakfasts—which
savings will make possible an eight
dollar dance.
If Our Masters wish to ride the i
'32 Horse until he becomes a very {
inert carcass, well and good, or i
lather wall and bad. But why write, |
then? We can write so that the rest !
of the class can know and appre- ;
ciate what goes on behind closed !;
doors. Let the Committee act in a i
hide-bound fashion in a world re- ! i
moved from actual conditions.
But let that smug committee know !]

| that their classmates know and
j realize what they are doing. Let the
i Powers-that-be know that they are
j forcing something down unwilling'
j throats; and that while they might
| have the power to do the stuffing,
they haven't the power to eradicate
the evil taste left in the mouths of
the helpless payers.
The general opinion that wo of

I guiding our senior destinies wiil
[ not be ruined if there are less stage
props hanging on and about the
Toy on Lobby. Yet on the other
hand if these Exalted Hold-Our
[ Fates would mould their plans to
the general will and to the facts
they would earn sincere apprecia
tion at the hands of their fellows.
This is a year of depression. It
seems almost sacrilegious that the
Senior Class should make no move
toward the recognition of that fact.
Especially does this become evident
when we read of the Founder's
ideals when he established Leland
Stanford Junior University. It was
supposed to be a democratic institu
tion where undue extravagances
were to be curtailed.
Because a majority of the class
desire a reduction—because a re
duction is possible without impair
ing the Ball—and because there is
a moral obligation on the Class of
'32 to take cognizance of the ideals
of this University and the terrible
suffering throughout the land, let
the Dance Committee reduce the
price of bids. —Abe Mellinkoff

death hold that the Dance Com
mittee and the President have on

Ball. If this small group is deter
mined to stand out against major- i
ity sentiment —and what is more j
important, if this minute minority :
is willing to stand out against the j
compelling demands of the cold [
figures—then there is nothing that !
can be done.
I! this infinitesimal fraction of the
Senior Class wishes to blindfold
itself to the many evident ways in
which the Ball Budget can be
shaved—without impairing the in- J
herent quality of the dance, the rest i
of the class—the bid-buyers that is— i
must suffer. Nothing can be done j
legally to pry off the self-imposed
blindfolds and make the committee
see that great cuts can be made in j
decorations, and breakfasts—which
savings will make possible an eight
dollar dance.

'32 Horse until he becomes a very {
inert carcass, well and good, or i

then? We can write so that the rest !

hide-bound fashion in a world re- ! i
moved from actual conditions.
