MARTIN'S SUMMER—By Vitki
Buum. The Cosmopolitan Rook
Corporation, New York. lf)31. CAt
the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Being the rather pointless tale of
a young, penniless Adonis, Vicki
Baum's latest book adds nothing to
the author's already high reputa
tion, but rather detracts from it. It
is expecting quite a bit for one to
wade through the lengthy tale of
Martin Heil, a young German
chemist, also a champion swimmer,
and not become utterly disgusted
and bored.
Far from being interesting is the
story of the youth as a swimming
instructor, and his love affairs may
be dismissed as insipid. The only
commendable characters in the en
tire volume are Puck and her utter
misfits of parents, yet, the author
seems to have tossed them aside as
of no account.
Martin, waiting for an invention
of his to be sold, falls in love with
May, one of a most charming pair
of twins. Here is the only laudable
portion of the book—the twin ele
ment, which might have become a
veritable second Comedy of Errors,
is very slight.
Throughout the book the only
impression gained of the hero is of
his weak character, despite his her
culean endeavors in swimming.
There is a conventional happy end
ing, which is rather far-fetched, and
the entire book may be classed as
a piece of trash. —J.M.11.
HUDDLE —At the Varsity Theatre.
If you like your college pictures
fast, simple, obvious, and with
plenty of rah-rah, "Huddle" is die
film for you.
Ramon Novarro (at Yale, if you
please) set about, "to get out of col
lege something besides what is in
books." Oddly enough, his taste
turned to football. Movie colleges
offer two choices: books or football.
With breath-taking speed our
hero gets himself a girl and an
enemy at one blow, the football
coach learns his name, and in the
next shot he is the idol of the Yale
rooting section. Nice work if you
can get it.
The only thing which we didn't
expect was that the hero should
spring a bad appendix on us. Thus,
poor lad, he was unable to win the
game; it ended in a tie. While bat
tling between his appendix and a

i desire to re-enter the game, he is J
j the perfect Portrait of a Young Man (
j in Distress.
j It is hard to believe that such a I
| nice lad as Ramon should have such |
j gosh-awful ordinary parents, and it j
I is even harder to have them bob- I
; bing up at odd moments.
Novarro tries almost painfully '
j hard to be convincing, and the |
i cards are simply stacked against !
! him.
Madge Evans is the heroine and i
! appeared off and on between end- j
j runs. Personally they could have i
| just told us the score of the game j
| and given us fore Madge Evans.
John Aldwell and Una Merkel, ,
j with their Southern accents, play !
| minor roles in first-class fashion.
| Ralph Graves, looking alarmingly ■
| like the senior Doug Fairbanks, i
| does a good job of the coach's part. !
I For all its obviousness, an enter- j
i taining film. —E.C. j
