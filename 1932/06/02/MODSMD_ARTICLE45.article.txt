LEAVE IT to Pop.
Just about the time they Ihink
they have him figured out, he re
tires behind the high green fence
which surrounds the practice grid
iron and comes out with something
so new and dazzling it leaves their
heads in a whirl.
And don't think they won't
whirl next fall!
While the athletic interest of the
campus has been centered on Ben I
Eastman, Bob Jones, the Hables
brothers, et al, Pop Warner has
been a busy man. We might even
say he has been a VERY busy man.
Here are some of the things he has
accomplished in spring practice:
1. Eliminated C formation.
2. Installed a new shift, in
volving a change from unbal
anced right to unbalanced left
formation, or vice versa, to take
the place of the shift from bal
anced C to unbalanced A for
mation which he inaugurated
two seasons ago.
Introduced a "double spin
ner" attack which leaves the
opposing players play ing tag
with each other.
4. Dropped the "double full -
hack*' system he has used for a
number of seasons in favor of a
backfield of three light, fast men
and Ills usual triple-threat full
back.
C FORMATION is out, but it
won't be missed. Pop's new A for
mation packs enough deception in
its various ramifications to keep
'em guessing until 5 o'clock any
Saturday afternoon. The new shift
accomplishes all that the old one
did, without involving a separate
formation. The principal idea with
the Old Man is to force the oppo
sition to watch the ball instead of
his linemen—and they have to do
that or get caught off-side if a shift
is a possibility.
About that double spinner at
tack: It's just about the fooling
est thing the Old Pox has pro
duced. Two backs spin instead
of one, interlocking as they spin.
The man who has the ball may
or may not give it to the other.
And whether he does or does
not, the possibilities of the play
are innumerable.
1 So far this season Warner has
confined tho efforts of his men to
perfecting the new running attack.
Passing as a possible threat has
been disregarded entirely. (Not that
it will be next fall, of course.) Yet
when the first team takes the ball,
it marches right down Ihe field
through the second outfit, in spite
of the fact that the secondary knows
there is no danger of passes and has
some idea of what the system is all
about.

' THEN when the second team !
: takes the offensive, it is the first !
| eleven which runs wildly about, 1
| wondering where in hell the ball is. j
j That should prove something or
I other about deception.
SPEED, SPEED, SPEED.
With young Jack Hillman as key -
I man and three flashy backs work
j ing with him, the Indian backfield j
! will have plenty of speed to execute j
j that deception. The double fullback
idea was great when Warner had ,
! at his command an unusual quan
; (ity of valuable big men. But now
| the opposite is the case—and Pop
j is taking advantage of a big crop |
' of fleet halfbacks.
Naturally a great deal of the
success of Warner's new attack
will depend on the line. The
backfield must have time to get
the new plays under way be
fore opposing linemen begin
messing around in the way. But
if a strong enough forward wall
I is moulded around Bill Corbus,
Ed Lettunich, Ben Palamoun
tain. and the rest—the Stanford
Indian will go places next fall.

: practice this year has been one of '
j the most successful ho has ever con- |

"It is hard to say right now i

Just about the time they Ihink
they have him figured out, he re

And don't think they won't
whirl next fall!
While the athletic interest of the
campus has been centered on Ben I
Eastman, Bob Jones, the Hables
brothers, et al, Pop Warner has
been a busy man. We might even
say he has been a VERY busy man.
Here are some of the things he has
accomplished in spring practice:
1. Eliminated C formation.
2. Installed a new shift, in
volving a change from unbal
anced right to unbalanced left
formation, or vice versa, to take
the place of the shift from bal
anced C to unbalanced A for
mation which he inaugurated
two seasons ago.
Introduced a "double spin
ner" attack which leaves the
opposing players play ing tag
with each other.
4. Dropped the "double full -
hack*' system he has used for a
number of seasons in favor of a
backfield of three light, fast men
and Ills usual triple-threat full
back.
C FORMATION is out, but it
won't be missed. Pop's new A for
mation packs enough deception in
its various ramifications to keep
'em guessing until 5 o'clock any
Saturday afternoon. The new shift
accomplishes all that the old one
did, without involving a separate
formation. The principal idea with
the Old Man is to force the oppo
sition to watch the ball instead of
his linemen—and they have to do
that or get caught off-side if a shift
is a possibility.
About that double spinner at
tack: It's just about the fooling
est thing the Old Pox has pro
duced. Two backs spin instead
of one, interlocking as they spin.
The man who has the ball may
or may not give it to the other.
And whether he does or does
not, the possibilities of the play
are innumerable.
1 So far this season Warner has
confined tho efforts of his men to
perfecting the new running attack.
Passing as a possible threat has
been disregarded entirely. (Not that
it will be next fall, of course.) Yet
when the first team takes the ball,
it marches right down Ihe field
through the second outfit, in spite
of the fact that the secondary knows
there is no danger of passes and has
some idea of what the system is all
about.

' THEN when the second team !
: takes the offensive, it is the first !
| eleven which runs wildly about, 1
| wondering where in hell the ball is. j
j That should prove something or
I other about deception.
SPEED, SPEED, SPEED.
With young Jack Hillman as key -
I man and three flashy backs work
j ing with him, the Indian backfield j
! will have plenty of speed to execute j
j that deception. The double fullback
idea was great when Warner had ,
! at his command an unusual quan
; (ity of valuable big men. But now
| the opposite is the case—and Pop
j is taking advantage of a big crop |
' of fleet halfbacks.
Naturally a great deal of the
success of Warner's new attack
will depend on the line. The
backfield must have time to get
the new plays under way be
fore opposing linemen begin
messing around in the way. But
if a strong enough forward wall
I is moulded around Bill Corbus,
