# MOLNAR'S PLAY READING TONIGHT
## Geddis Has Military Role In "Olympia" 
### 
Terrence Geddis, hitherto rele
gated chiefly to heavy gangsterdom,
rises to royalty this evening in the
reading of Molnar's "Olympia,"
scheduled for a special meeting of
Sword and Sandals to be held at
7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre.
Geddis is to play the role of Gen
eral Plata-Ettingen, a jovial mili
tarist, willingly henpecked by the
Princess, his wife, during the few
days each year he is able to rest
from his war duties at a South
Europe spa.
Plan Fall Series
Others in the cast are Jean Jami
son, who will read the title l'ole,
Dorothy Tully, Virginia Clemens,
Dave Davis, James Lyons, Joseph
Wolf, and Dr. Margery Bailey, who
will assist, reading stage directions.
Vallejo Gantner, president of the
organization sponsoring the series
of readings, has announced plans
for a fall series. Plays being con
sidered include Hendrik Ibsen's
"Ghosts," and "Caponsacchi," a stage
version of Browning's lengthy poem,
"The Ring and the Book." Several
current Broadway successes are un
der consideration as well and indi
cations point toward a series of
leadings as successful as the one
just closing.
"Olympia'' Last Play
"Olympia," a rapid, witty comedy,
will be the last reading this quar
tei\ It was produced in New York
several seasons ago. Outstanding in
the production was Laura Hope
Crews, last seen in San Francisco
as Mrs. Phelps in "The Silver Cord."
This play, like most of Molnar's, is
amusing, does not seek to be great.
"Olympia" has been called one of
the Hungarian playwright's best
works.
Since the curtain will rise prompt
ly visitors are asked to be in their
seats on time. Doors will be closed
