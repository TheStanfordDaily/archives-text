# FROSH DINE FREE SATURDAY, JUNE 11
## 
### 
Not deserted, not silent, will be
Encina Commons on Saturday, June
11. For the second time in nearly
six years flames will roar in the
great range, dishes rattle, and hash
ers hurry on a Saturday. Freshmen
and clubmen are to eat three meals
that day and pay nothing for them.
It will be on the house.
Such was the announcement made
yesterday by Mrs. Hilda Longyear
Watson, director of Encina Com
mons. This arrangement has been
made, Mrs. Watson said, in order to
facilitate the preparation for and
taking of finals on June 11.
Men who are regular Encina
boarders will be allowed to dine
upon showing their meal ticket
books. Meals will be served on the
customary finals week schedule of
hours.
