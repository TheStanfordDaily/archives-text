NEW YORK, June 1. (/P) —Discov-
ery of a jelly-like film-making sub
stance in oil—a hitherto unnoticed
oil within oil—was announced here
today.
Its authors, two leading lubrica
tion engineers, said it furnishes a
"startling new theory of lubrication
—and practical opportunity to speed
up automobiles and all machinery
with both less wear and greater
power."
WUPPERTAL, Germany, June 1
(TP)—Police arrested ninety-six Na
tional Socialists here last night after
firing upon and breaking up a Nazi
meeting.
