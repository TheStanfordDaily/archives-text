# WALKER FIGHTS OUSTING THREATS
## Bond Deal Held Sufficient To Remove Mayor 
### 
j NEW YORK, June 1. (/P)â€”Evi
( dence which Samuel Seabury said
j constituted grounds for the removal
I of Mayor Walker was presented to
; the Hofstadter Legislative Commit-
I tee today.
j The gray-haired committee coun
-1 sel charged Walker had violated the
I city charter by holding bonds in a
| company which received a city con
i tract for $43,556 worth of traffic
j lights.
j "And I say it is grounds for re
! moval and has been so held and is
| so provided in section 1533 of the
j city charter," Seabury told the in
j quiry board in stern tones.
Walker himself, in Detroit, charg
j ed Seabury with "unfairness" and
I said the lawyer "well knew" that
| the bonds "came into my possession
without, any knowledge on my part
! of the company's business."
j Seabury's statement to the com-
I mittee was the first in which he has
J given any intimation he will file
! charges against the mayor, and the
j first time he has said the mayor
I should be ousted.
