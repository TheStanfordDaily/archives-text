# BUSY SUMMER BEFORE INDIAN CINDER STARS
## Cards Meet Olympic Club, S.F.U., California At Kezar Tomorrow BIG BEN AFTER RECORD Redshirts May Enter Long Beach Semi-Finals 
### Dick Strouse 
In just two weeks, Stanford's j
cholarly horde will, much to its sad
hagrin, be forced to start carrying !
(round golf clubs—or picks and j
hovels—instead of textbooks and |
>inders. In just two weeks, the sum- j
tier's rest for the school year's
veary will begin, but there will be
10 respite from training for the in
lustrious Card track team.
While the rest of us look dismally ;
orward to an idle, useless vacation
he spikemen see only the climax
if their longest season. For this
rack year won't be over till some j
irae in August when Bob Jones has I
ut-thrown and Ben Eastman has j
ut-run the greatest of the world's j
thletes in the Olympic Games j
inals.
P.A.A.'s Tomorrow
Before that, however, the Indian j
pikemen will engage in some more ;
r less inconsequential meets. To
morrow they will again face the j
)lympic Club, S.F.U., and Califor- !
iia, this time in the P.A.A.'s at 2
clock at Kezar Stadium, when Ben
lastman will be out to crack the
/orld'.s 800-meter record.
There is a chance that some and j
ierhaps all of the Stanford cinder
ickers will enter the Long Beach i
)lympic Games semi-final trials on 1
une 17 and 18. If they do, it will
e because they are pessimistic,
uperstitious, and ambitious.
Two Chances to Qualify
For the 1.C.4-A.'s, to be held this |
ear over at the new Berkeley oval, j
lso are preliminariese for the final j
unerican trials. Entrance in the .
,ong Beach meet will be as a sort ;
f insurance: it will give the Cards j
aw chances instead of one to |
ualify. Which is not a bad idea, j
s hurdlers hit hurdles, sprinters,
et poor starts, and everyone gets
ervous.
Then will come the meet for I
hich the Cards have been pointing !
ver since the S.C. defeat —the ,
C.4-A.'s. If the power of powers,
hoever or whatever that is, rules
iat Les Hables can represent i
•tanford, the Indians will have a
hance.
Hables May Run
Hables has been out on a leave of
bsence, but he still may be allowed j
j run as the entire Indian team
'as in the same predicament in
928 and competed. Even if Les
ompctes, Stanford will not present j
s full strength as Bill Werder, |
ellar broad-jumper, will be out ,
ecau.se of a muscle that has finally .
iven way for good and because ,
aptain Ike Hablees is also through, j
Even without Hables and Werder, i
en Eastman and the Card strength j
i the weights may out-score U.S.C. j
he meet will depend on Les Hables j
rength (if he enters at all) and on !
ie ability of the Eastern hurdlers, ;
istance men, and high-jumpers to
ike points away from the Trojans. I
Olympic Trials Here
The final Olympic trials will be j
eld right here on the Farm and !
would be fitting if the whole
tanford team qualified. Yes, fit- |
ng, but impossible. Eastman and j
ones are of course inevitable Olym- i
ic material. Bill Miller, improving '
aulter, should also make the grade,
ut then pole-vaulters are eccentric
nimals at best.
