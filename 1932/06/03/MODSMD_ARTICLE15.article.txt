I and Rogers' big blue cabriolet, which
| he drives himself.
Pop Sits With Rogers
The friendly grin and cute man
! nerisms which won him millions
jof screen followers were much in
evidence yesterday afternoon. While
: Pop Warner was sitting with Rog
! ers, Denny, Pop's right-hand man,
| ambled by. Said Rogers: "He's a
i good guyâ€”he's an Indian. He's
i been hanging around Pop so long
' he's beginnin' to look like him."

i his daily column for 300 newspapers
|on a portable typewriter. He ad

Rogers replied, "Only when Con
i gross is in session."

"If you are a humorist, there is no
other humorist."
