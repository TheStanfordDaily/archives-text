# TED FIO-RITA TO RELIEVE HECHE AT SENIOR BALL
## St. Francis Orchestra Will Replace Campus Band At One o'Clock 
### 

With Ted Fio-Rita and his seven-
teen-piece orchestra to relieve
Gordon Heche and his band at 1
o'clock, the Senior Ball committee
has successfully solved the music
problem.
Gordon Heche, whose popularity
has been on the rise, will open the
Ball and play until 1 o'clock when
Fio-Rita and his band arrive via
special bus from the St. Francis,
where through the good graces of
(he management they will be per
mitted to close at 12 instead of the
customary 1.
Accompanying the band are four
singers whose renditions will supply
entertainment in the short inter-
missions. Bid sale to Seniors opens
| today at the A.S.S.U. office. Pro
grams and favors are ready for dis
tribution, but in view of the fact
that only a limited number has been
ordered, only the first 200 bid-buyers
; will receive the favors and pro
grams.
