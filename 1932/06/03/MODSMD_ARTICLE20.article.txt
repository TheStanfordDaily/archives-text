# Campus Chiefs Urge Seniors To Swell Fund
## Endowment Pledges Asked By Student Leaders 
### 
To swell the unrestricted dona- j
| tions of the alumni to the Univer- i
j sity, all graduating seniors are re- ;
| quested to fill out the subscription
j cards to the Class of 1932 Endow- i
i ment Fund recently sent them. The
i pledge does not bind subscribers to
j payment but merely is an indication
I of the amount they feel they will 1
be able to contribute after leaving i
I school.
Following are some statements of 1
j campus leaders concerning the en- :
dowment:
Bob Brown: "The continued prog
! ress of Stanford University depends j
! upon the active support of its alum- ;
| ni. This support must be more sub- j
stantial than a mere interest. Ad- j
I vance can best be facilitated by j
fluid monetary resources. The En - i
i dowment Fund is ideally suited to I
i this need and its growth means ex- I
pansion for the University."
Jack Tarr: "Through alumni con
tributions to the Endowment Fund!
I we can all co-operate in building j
up a fund from which improvements |
{ can be made."
Milton Hand: "If the University
! is to maintain its position as one of j
i the most respected educational in - j
! stitutions in the world it must have j
I financial support from its graduates, j
The Endowment Fund offers the i
i Seniors an opportunity to contribute 1
| toward its needs and to closer as- j
I sociate themselves, in later years!
| with its advancement."
Warren Biggs: "This is a fine op- '
j portunity for each student to benefit |
j the University, and to express an j
i appreciation for its guidance."
Helen Osborne: "Under the elas- j
i tic terms provided us in suhscrib- j
! ing to this Fund, of which the Uni
versity stands in such need, it seems |
to me that we should take advant
age of the opportunity and pledge
what we can now."
Miriam Strout: "One of the few
constructive things every student is ;
capable of doing for the University.
| Its beauty lies in that it is purely
I voluntary."
John Duel: "By this system we
j can repay the University for the â– 
, innumerable intangible benefits!
j which we have received."
