# Lucy Brown, '32, Killed as Plane Crashes in Dive
## Fred Harvey, Palo Alto Pilot, Near Death following Smash-up of Airplane at Alameda Airport; Aviatrix to Have Graduated June 20 
### 
MISS LUCY BROWN, 21, "flying co-ed" of Stanford, and only daughter
of a faculty member, was almost instantly killed, and Fred Harvey, 28,
Palo Alto, was fatally injured when a plane in which they were leaving
the Alameda airport yesterday fell 200 feet in a nose dive.
The girl was taken from the burning wreckage of the plane in a dying
condition. She was dead by the time she reached the Alameda Sanatorium.

Harvey was unconscious, but re
covered sufficiently to make a brief
statement.
Believed Fatally Hurt
Later he became unconscious and
surgeons expressed the belief that
he was fatally injured.
Miss Brown is the daughter of
Dr. Walter H. Brown, a member of
the physical education faculty, liv
ing at 2326 Ramona street, Palo
Alto. She was a senior in economics
and was to have received her degree
June 20. She left the Palo Alto air
port with Harvey, who holds a lim
ited pilot's license, yesterday morn
ing for a trip after airplane supplies.
The pair landed at the Alameda
airport shortly before noon, trans
acted their business, and took off
again.
Falters at 200 Feet
Harvey was at the controls. At
about 200 feet above the southwest
ern end of the airfield the plane fal
tered and went into a nose dive.
Witnesses expressed the opinion
that Harvey had made too rapid a
climb in the take-off, a common
fault with inexperienced pilots.
The plane in its fall narrowly
missed Frank McKenzie, port cap
tain of the Alameda Yacht Club,
who was walking across the field.
McKenzie and Charles Kidder,
field service manager, who jumped
into an automobile and drove to the
spot, were the first to reach the
victims of the crash.
Dragged From Flames
The plane had started to burn
when McKenzie dragged the man
gled and unconscious body of the
girl from the wreckage. He rescued
Harvey, and Kidder arrived and ex
tinguished the fire with a hand ex
tinguisher. The two victims were
then taken to the hospital.
Prominent on Campus
Miss Brown was one of the most
active seniors on the campus. Prom
inent in dramatic productions and
aviation, she was a meifiber of the
99 Club, the women's national fly
ing body, and Masquers, women's
honorary dramatic society.
Funeral services will be held Sat
urday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock from
the Roller and Hapgood chapel on
University avenue. Dr. Augustus
Murray will officiate.
