# THE 						LAST WHIRL
## 
### 
I)car Stew:
A custom set hv my long line of illustrious predecessors
inllicls upon you this Inst tearful farewell before 1 collect
my large share of the profits, hide a typewriter under my
coal and depart from this cozy little shack huddled incon
spicuously by the Press building.
All the well-thumbed propaganda on the Lower Di
vision. Ihe liftec 11 cent increase for the Daily and nickel
eotl'ee al the t nion has been tossed into the wastebasket.
How ver. this campus is still pregnant with queer doings
by ils inmates that you can mess around with, sometimes
Letting you aroused, more often giving you a good laugh.
You will develop a good sense of humor watching all
that happens around here and remember that, although a
little vitriol poured in the right places is all right, il is far
belter to feather your darts with a little fun; they seem to
sink deeper.
II you ever get out on a limb and are not sure about
what to do, run upstairs and see Prof. Smith, lie is always
i ( ady with good, sound advice and he never commands.
You have the feeling on leaving him that you may do as
you please after lie has stated his opinion.
Keep an eye on the women, Slew, for, like a Laurel and
Hardy comedy, they are always good for a laugh. Their
intercollegiate sports have a bare beginning but any minute
(hey arc apt to slip back into the old rut. Although the re
cent elections have provided a change of scenery, Ihe Dean
of Women slill cracks the whip over the cowering A.W.S.
ollicials. Because women are women, you will never be
able to do anything about it; nevertheless, their antics fur
nish light and entertaining material with which to till this
column. Every now and then Pan-Hellenic Council will do
something. Sometimes ils actions are commendable; often,
a curious result of feminine psychology and sorority riv
alry, thev arc not so good.
With two men's rushing periods next year anything is
liable to happen. The new plan being tried has some bad
features, noticeably the ten man limit, so you may get a
lot of editorial copy from litis source.
The t nion is a perpetual battleground of students versus
management over prices, service and quality. 11 might pay
you to dip into the scrap now and again. There are rumors
(hat the Junior Opera may be discontinued so you may be
able lo do the campus a service along this line.
A few other major items that you might jot down in
your little black book are football; the husky athletes in
control of student government; class ollices which offer
little work, no honor and a lot of trouble; the Honor ('.ode,
which is not yet dry behind Ihe ears and may turn into an
ugly infant; and .... but there are others too numerous
10 lit in this column which you will find out for yourself
soon enou. 1 '
No mattci what you do or what you say there will be
someone who doesn't like it, some of whom will probably
say so to you. Hut you can't make a direct statement with
out irritating al least a few and, if you could, it probably
would not be worth much. II is impossible to please every
body all the time, so slick lo what you think is right and
you will 14cI farther than trying lo pamper everyone with
an axe to grind that sticks his head into your spacious
011 ice.
You are taking this job with a heart lightened by
thoughts of a rosy future and an ignorance of coming
troubles. Your head is filled with a flock of fancy ideas
thai may or may not have the opportunity for development.
Your frame is, as yet. unmulilaled by blows from the stu
dent body, faculty, administration and even an unruly staff.
So i.ike a tip from an old man and make the most of your
youthful energy. The lime will slip past more rapidly than
a co-ed racing lo beat a lockout and your turn will be over
before you are fully conscious thai it has begun.
You are well staffed. Slew, and your organization should
run along without a hitch. Willi dapper Fritz (ioodwin and
staid Frank Lloyd as your associates, the task of filling
the editorial column should offer no difficulties.
i«on Kennedy, managing editor, will do a good job of
whipping your staff into shape and seeing thai they are
around when they are supposed lo be.
Of course Melts Hawkins will be cluttering up your of
iiee as women's editor. She is capable enough so keep her
hard at work. Your collection of journalists below the edi
torial board is as good as you could ask for so keep them
lired up and they will provide plenty ol copy lo till your
paper.
II is all yours lo play with now, Stew, make Ihe most of
il. Remember, a good bluff, well swung, availeth much.
Megnrds,
SULLY.

How ver. this campus is still pregnant with queer doings
by ils inmates that you can mess around with, sometimes
Letting you aroused, more often giving you a good laugh.
You will develop a good sense of humor watching all
that happens around here and remember that, although a
little vitriol poured in the right places is all right, il is far
belter to feather your darts with a little fun; they seem to
sink deeper.

Keep an eye on the women, Slew, for, like a Laurel and

something. Sometimes ils actions are commendable; often,
a curious result of feminine psychology and sorority riv

With two men's rushing periods next year anything is
liable to happen. The new plan being tried has some bad
features, noticeably the ten man limit, so you may get a

The t nion is a perpetual battleground of students versus
management over prices, service and quality. 11 might pay
you to dip into the scrap now and again. There are rumors
(hat the Junior Opera may be discontinued so you may be
able lo do the campus a service along this line.
A few other major items that you might jot down in

management over prices, service and quality. 11 might pay
you to dip into the scrap now and again. There are rumors
(hat the Junior Opera may be discontinued so you may be
able lo do the campus a service along this line.
A few other major items that you might jot down in
your little black book are football; the husky athletes in
control of student government; class ollices which offer
little work, no honor and a lot of trouble; the Honor ('.ode,
which is not yet dry behind Ihe ears and may turn into an
ugly infant; and .... but there are others too numerous
10 lit in this column which you will find out for yourself
soon enou. 1 '
No mattci what you do or what you say there will be
someone who doesn't like it, some of whom will probably
say so to you. Hut you can't make a direct statement with
out irritating al least a few and, if you could, it probably
would not be worth much. II is impossible to please every
body all the time, so slick lo what you think is right and
you will 14cI farther than trying lo pamper everyone with
an axe to grind that sticks his head into your spacious
011 ice.
You are taking this job with a heart lightened by
thoughts of a rosy future and an ignorance of coming
troubles. Your head is filled with a flock of fancy ideas
thai may or may not have the opportunity for development.
Your frame is, as yet. unmulilaled by blows from the stu
dent body, faculty, administration and even an unruly staff.
So i.ike a tip from an old man and make the most of your
youthful energy. The lime will slip past more rapidly than
a co-ed racing lo beat a lockout and your turn will be over
before you are fully conscious thai it has begun.
You are well staffed. Slew, and your organization should
run along without a hitch. Willi dapper Fritz (ioodwin and
staid Frank Lloyd as your associates, the task of filling
the editorial column should offer no difficulties.
i«on Kennedy, managing editor, will do a good job of
whipping your staff into shape and seeing thai they are
around when they are supposed lo be.
Of course Melts Hawkins will be cluttering up your of
iiee as women's editor. She is capable enough so keep her
hard at work. Your collection of journalists below the edi
torial board is as good as you could ask for so keep them
lired up and they will provide plenty ol copy lo till your
paper.
II is all yours lo play with now, Stew, make Ihe most of
il. Remember, a good bluff, well swung, availeth much.
Megnrds,
SULLY.
