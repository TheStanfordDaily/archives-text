# BULL SESSION
## "... BUT THE MELODY LINGERS ON" 
### 
Another quarter prepares for the |
jump to oblivion. Its final leap is u !
little different from the ordinary, '
however. For this Spring Quarter;
can have the unique pleasure of !
laughing itself into an absolute hy- |
steria before passing from view. |
Imagine the humor —if you can —of
12 Seniors forcing their will on 216
fellow-classmates. The difference
between the groups, however, is that
the first insignificant half-fistful re
ceives free bids and admits its own j
infallibility; whereas the largerj
group pays for its bids and hasn't j
the power to admit anything.
.., . I
The Committee, in their own j
words, wish to present a "parting ,
Ball" which "the members of the i
Senior Class will remember as a
crowning event of four years at col
lege." They have done that already.
In more than one way, this year's j
Ball will be a crowning event of no j
mean proportions. Never, probably,:
have the men and women of '32 ever 1
witnessed a dance committee ride J
roughshod over the expressed will
of such a vast number of class- !
mates; and over the Executive Com- |
mittee of the Senior Class as well! |
It's a crowning event which reeks
with astounding impudence — and
flashes humiliating insults to the;
Seniors of 1932.
One hesitates, not only for one
moment but for several moments, ;
to contradict any committee which '
has such an all-knowing grasp on |
the situation as to ignore everybody j
■<. nd everything but themselves and i
their own notions. Yet the facts cry j
out for expression. The Ball Moguls
allow $500 for breakfasts. Yet early j
morning repasts consisting of to
mato juice (very appropriate) or i
frozen orange juice (not so appro
priate), scrambled eggs, sausages,
buttered snails, and coffee—all this
can be obtained for the Ball for only
$300, or a saving of $200.

This presupposes that about 30!
hashers will be willing to work for
50 cents an hour. If such jobs were
available, the hirers would probably j
have to carry large bludgeons to j
beat off applicants. Who is willing
to serve this meal? The Union —of- [

I ten maligned—after a little coax- j
I ing consented for the sake of the \
j Senior Class to stick its beagle into:
j the present fight—or discussion,
J should we say. The estimate is at;
j cost —but the Senior Class should'
| not object to that. A $200 saving is
of course a $200 saving.
Saving No. 2 can come in decora
tions. The Toyon Lobby was re
cently decorated for $20. Double
j that figure because the Ball is a
1 formal —making $40. Add $60 be-
| cause the Seniors will have to rent
j equipment. That makes $100 —or j
I still a saving of $150 from the omni- :
j potent Budget prepared by these j
j divinely guided souls who know in- i
! finitely more than mere mortal man. j
Savin.g No. 3 can be made in J
watching small expenses and by so I
doing cutting Ihe "margin" by $100. j
j This cut is not rash when we bear i
in mind that $100 is allowed—in ad- I
idition to this sum —for miscellane- j
[ous expenses. Further, less margin
1 would be needed with bids selling at 1
| eight dollars.
! F?ecapitulating we find savings of j
i $200 in food, $150 in decorations and I
$100 in excess margin. Adding we 1
j find a saving of $450 which, while ■
jless than previous savings, is still j
; more than enough to cut bids to $8 j
-without impairing the major fac
' tor of th? dance—the music; or the
' less major elements of favors and
! programs.
We have before u.s a list of words j
| that one may affix to such people
as all-seeing, all-knowing, and no-|
i hearing Dance Committees. One can i
i still be a gentleman and use these'
! words according to Dr. Frank Crane,
: They include such as dunderheads,
1 dolts, ninnies, etc. We refrain, how
over, from using them in reference;
to the Ball worthies for fear that it
i might give them doubts as to their
i own infallible superiority. That
1 would be fatal because any group
that will ignore the overwhelming
' sentiment of Iheir classmates in
j such a matter needs every ounce
| of self-created superiority that they
can possibly muster.
