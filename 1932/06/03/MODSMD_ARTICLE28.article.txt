PREVIEW OF PALO ALTO FILMS, j
That Stanford is to be well enter
tained during the weeks of its i
downfall is evidenced by the shows i
for the next week.
Sunday the Stanford opens Ruth
Chatterton in "The Rich Are Al
ways With Us," an intricate and yet
sophisticated plot in which the fam- ;
ous star is offered the type of role
in which she earned her fame.
John Barrymore in '"State's At
torney" graces the Varsity screen
that day, with the star in a light
role which gives his talent full
play.
"Night Court," a vastly different J
court story, comes to the Stanford ;
on Wednesday. A complicated plot j
and a stellar cast make this an ab- j
sorbing film.
That splendid actor, Edward G. !
Robinson, has another dramatic role j
in "Two Seconds," at the Varsity on i
Wednesday. —E.C.
THE HARLEQUINS—At the Sainte
Claire Hotel.
Here we have an orchestra that
makes you happy and makes you
feel like dancing—an orchestra that
has rhythm and variation, and best j
of all—what it plays is music!
Brescia knows how to lead the
boys and the boys know how to fol
low Brescia. If you liked his intro
ductory program at the New Stan
ford last week, you'll be more than
pleased when you hear them "Say
It With Music" at the Sainte Claire.
This orchestra even manages to
play "St. Louis Blues" in a way that
is different. Something else that
you'll like is Brescia's weakness for
medleys of old and new tunes. He
has some colorful arrangements of
his own too, which beat out a de
cided and persistent rhythm. No
table among these is "Aboriginal
Dance" which may be a better tune
for listening lhan for dancing be
cause the dance it suggests is hardly
meant for the dance floor.
Next time you get the urge to go
dancing, get it on Wednesday or
Saturday and go to the Sainte Claire
in San Jose.

A YEARBOOK OF STANFORD
WRITING —At the Stanford Book
store.
The new English Club Yearbook,
which is to appear Monday, shows
a considerable advance over last
year's. In poetry especially a change
I is to be noted: free verse has yielded
j its popularity to more conventional
forms, and the examples that remain
are not merely sentences chopped
up to look like verse. The sonnet is
particularly in evidence, the sonnet
sequence by Ruth Aschen and Ed
win Williams being outstanding. The
poetry of James Broughton, J. V.
Cunningham, and Victor Ricketts is
also good.
Among the short stories Richard
Friendlich's "Blight Boy" and Rob
ert Brauns' "Dad Was Dead" are
perhaps the best. The first is a keen
study of an adolescent egotist, the
second an observant sketch of a
young boy's emotions. Less bril
liant, but still excellent, are John
Tolman's "The Three Pagans" and
Grace Margaret Webster's "Charnc!
House."

j Of especial interest are the two j
one act plays included. Charles Hof- j
| fman's "Nouveaux Pauvres" is a '
; comedy with underlying pathos, J
i while Waldo Salt's "The Penalty" is i
ja theatrical melodrama. It is inter- !
jesting to note that both were written |
especially for acting, Hoffman's be- I
: ing built on clever lines and Salt's j
! around a spectacular setting. At |
present Salt's play is being rehearsed ;
' for production at the Palo Alto
Community Theatre next Monday.
The present book seems to be
getting away from the tendency of j
being literary to the exclusion of i
everything else. The passionate zeal
for trivial description has died out
I and it is no longer sacrilege for a 1
• story to have a plot. Also, the per
' centage of humor is considerably in-
I creased. Aside from four subtle i
: parodies by an anonymous contribu
! tor, Robert Brauns, James Sandoe,
I and M. le Rat du Montmarte have ;
contributed humorous articles. In i
addition, almost all of the stories
contain a fair proportion of humor.
The judges have not yet selected
the winner of the fifty dollar prize,
but the Sonnet Sequence, Friend
lich's "Bright Boy" and Braun's
I "Dad Was Dead" are likely condi
; dates. —C.A.Z.
