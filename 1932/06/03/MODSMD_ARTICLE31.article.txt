BALL PETITION
The Editor, Sir:
The point may be raised that the
21G signers of the $8 Ball Petition
may not represent the majority of
the class—which numbers over 500.
Such a misconception obviously
falls to the ground with an ugly
thud when we consider that all
members of the Senior Class were
not asked to sign.
Of those approached about 95 per
cent were willitig to sign; therefore
we can assume that because those
approached represent a cross-sec
tion of the whole class, approxi
mately 95 per cent of the WHOLE
class favors the content of the pe
tition. Sincerely yours,
Leslie L. IVlotz
