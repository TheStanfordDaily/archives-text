# HONOR CODE OBJECTIONS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A petition has been drawn up to
alter the procedure of the trial oi
Honor Code violations. May I sug
gest the following objections to that
petition, as printed in your Wednes
day issue?
1. If the President of the Univer
sity will be one of the Honor Code
court will he not be to all practical
purposes the whole court? For what
student, in the august presence of
the President, will venture to con
test his views with any force?
2. If the accuser must testify in
the presence of the accused, will it
not be harder yet to find anyone to
report a violation of the Honor
Code?
Think of the bad feeling which
will be caused if the accused knows
who reported him. There are many
who might otherwise report a viola
tion who will be prevented from do
ing so by fear of the enmity of the
accused.
3. If the accused be acquitted, is
not the apology from the accuser a
totally unnecessary humiliation to a
man who had done but his duty, and
an unpleasant one at that?
Yours sincerely,
Richard Behrens Eaton.
