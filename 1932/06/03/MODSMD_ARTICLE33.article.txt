# A 						$10 BALL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While we do not wield the facile
pen of Mr. Mellinkoff, we will try
in plain English to state the position
and reasons therefor of the Senior
Ball Committee concerning the
lowering of the price of bids to the
Senior Ball.
To the committee this agitation
of Mr. Meliinkofl assumes a farcical
look. He has wasted much space in
THE STANFORD DAILY to wage
his battle. Two dollars are two dol
lars, but in the $10 regions we feel
that it does not have as much effect
— that the seniors can as easily
gather together $10 as $8.
We feel that a reduction of $2
from a $10 bid is not enough to make
it worth while reducing the quality
of the dance. If we could make a
material reduction in price, we
would—but the dance would be just
another dance; we refuse to have
that be so. Our plans have gone too
I far for us to make a material reduc
, tion, anyway.
Mr. Meliinkofl is a good debater,
and logical thinker. But in this case
his logic is not based on fact. He has
converted many people to his way
of thinking. But the committee feels
that with full knowledge of the facts,
| signed his petition, and that many
of those who did sign will not go to
the ball anyway. They, therefore,

are not affected by the price of
bids. Incidentally, 216 people have
signed the petition; there are 513
graduating seniors. Where is Mr. |
Mellinkoff's overwhelming majority?
We have been put in a tough spot
by the noise that Mr. Mellinkoff and ,
his aides have been making. If we
do not lower the price of the Senior
Ball, we will face the criticism yf
harshly burdening the backs of those
seniors who go to the ball; if we !
should lower them, those who go to
the ball will be outspoken in their
criticism of its quality. Therefore, i
since we expect criticism no matter
which course of action we follow, ;
we are trying to do the best for the 1
class, having full cognizance of the 1
factors and items entering into the ,
putting on of a good ball. There can I
be no other course satisfactory.
(Signed)
The Senior Ball Committee, j
