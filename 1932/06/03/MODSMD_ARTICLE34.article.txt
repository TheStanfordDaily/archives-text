# UPHOLDING THE PETITION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I should like to make a few state- j
ments concerning the petition rele- j
vant to the Honor Code which was j
submitted to the Executive Com- j
mittee on Tuesday.
You say in your editorial of today j
that the Councils "have admirably
performed their functions this year
and there is no need to turn over
this part of student government to
the faculty when the students have j
shown themselves capable of han- !
dling it themselves." You yourself j
published not so long ago an edi- ,
torial condemning the procedure of :
the Council in dealing with a case j
of alleged cheating, in which the ac- !
cused was told that a previous con- !
fession had implicated her. It was j
afterwards admitted that this was ]
done to trick herÂ» into a confession j
of guilt. Do you call this perform
ing their functions admirably? Why
contradict yourself?
There is also the general objection
to the accused being confronted by
his accuser. In the present system
there are possibilities of grudge ac
cusations. What chancc has a man
to defend himself if he does not
know who accuses him? As it is
now, the action of the Councils is
reminiscent of the historical "Star
Chamber." Which would you rather
have: fewer accusations and a fair
trial, supervised by competent legal
advisors, or a hit-and-miss assort
ment of accusations with potential
unjust expulsion?
The fact that names are to be
withheld from publication is to in
sure the continuation of the present
| admirable policy of the council. Why
force upon a student who has been
! expelled for cheating the public
stigma of a criminal? If his name
I is published, he will never have a
'chance to rectify his mistakes be
i cause no other person will trust
, him.
The petition is aimed, not so much
at the actions of the present Coun
: cils, but at the possibilities of abuse
I by others. If you assume the Stan
ford student honorable enough to
keep from cheating in an examina-
I tion, you must assume him courage
! ous enough in the right of his con-
S victions to face in court the one
he has accused of cheating.
