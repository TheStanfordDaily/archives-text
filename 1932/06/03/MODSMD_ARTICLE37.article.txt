# INFLUX OF STARVING CHINESE DECLARED CAUSE OF PRESENT MANCHURIAN CRISIS
##

"Human life has little significance
to the Chinese," says Alfred Crofts,
candidate for a Ph.D. degree in
English here, who lived in Chefoo,
northern China, from hi.s infancy
until he had completed his sec
ondary school education.
A superstitious Chinese never will
rescue a drowning man, according
to Crofts, because he believes thai
the water gods want the victim and
he is afraid to incur their anger.
If he is not superstitious, he will
bargain with the struggling man in
order to get promise of a sizable
reward before he saves him.
Crofts told of the pilgrimage of
hunger-stricken Chinese who passed
through Chefoo on their way to
Manchuria, when that country was
comparatively unsettled, hoping to
find means of sustenance there
which could not be found elsewhere
in overcrowded China. Often three
or four hundred were packed in a
small boat, stacked one on top of
another so that they could not move.

When the boat sank or was grounded
and the cargo of humans was
drowned or frozen to death it was
considered a matter of small sig
nificance, for a worse and slower
fate would have befallen them had I
they Jived.
This influx of starving Chinese is
the true cause of the present Man- j
ehurian crisis, Crofts believes, for j
the Japanese realized that they must 1
act quickly or be assimilated by the
immigrants and hence lose control
of this important province.
The Chefoo school is a typically j
British institution, attended by sons j
of the English business men in the
town and staffed by Oxford profes
sors. No honor code but the "word
of an Englishman" is necessary, j
Crofts asserts, and cheating is ab- '
solutely unknown.
Cricket, soccer, cross country rac- |
ing, swimming and rowing are the
chief sports. There are no paid
coaches and no gate receipts. Ath
letics are indulged in purely for the j
love of the game. '
