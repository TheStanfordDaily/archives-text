# Today Last Chance For Lower Division Programs
## 
### 
Lower Division women who have
not, as yet, been advised about their
programs for next year at the Dean
of Women's office should make ap
pointments for today, as this is the
last, day that such advisory counsel
will be given. The approval ot the
Dean of Women is required on ail
programs of lower division women.
Sororities at Ohio State are not
permitted to use airplanes during
rushing. Well, well.
