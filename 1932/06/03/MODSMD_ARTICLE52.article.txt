# CAMPUS BOOKSTORE PROFITS FALL OFF LESS THAN IN EAST
## 
### 
Business at the Stanford Book
store has dropped off this year less
than at most of the other college
bookstores of the nation, according
to R. M. Stager, manager of the lo
cal store, who returned yeseteerday
from a convention of college book
sellers in New York.
Business at some of the college
stores has dropped as much as 30
per cent since last year, Stager de
clares, and at many of them it has
fallen from 15 to 20 per cent. Yet
â€¢it Stanford the loss of business this
yeai* is not more than 13 per cent.
Nearly 25 per cent of Ihe $1,350
rebate being offered at the Stan
ford bookstore was collected yes
terday. There is also more than
$1,300 in uncalled-for rebates, of
past years, and if those of 1928-1029
and 1929-1930 arc not claimede by
September 31, they will be wiped
off the books.
Delaware was the only colony
settled by the Swedes.
