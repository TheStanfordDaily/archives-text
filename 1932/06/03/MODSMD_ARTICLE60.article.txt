# SOPHS WIN W.A.A. FIELD DAY EVENTS
## Second, Third Places Go To Seniors, Juniors 
### 
The sophomores crashed through
I yesterday in W.A.A.'s annual Field
i Day, crowding the seniors into sec
! ond place, showing the juniors the
third seat, and leaving the freshmen
| the fourth berth.
The seniors won the interclass
; tennis competition when their star
player, Scotty McDougall, trounced
Pat Barkelew, 6-1, 6-0, capturing the
cup for her class and the University
j championship for herself.
The freshmen won the interclass
archery competition, running up a
score of 1456 points. Kathleen
J Thornburn, freshman, won the day's
! honors with a 363 total. During the
: day's shooting 15 girls made points
for their outfits.
The juniors won the day in swim
i ming, but the sophomores had a
' better all-season average and thus
' won the swimming cup. The swim
| ming meet was unusually close, with
the juniors nosing out the sopho
i mores by but one point, 28 to 27,
the seniors winning 20 points and
the frosh tallying 5.
i Not the least interesting of the
' day's events were the exhibitions
given by the life-saving classes at
3 o'clock, the elementary inter
pretative class at 4 o'clock, and the
i fencing class at 5:30. Featured in
the dance solos were: Helen Ray,
Anna Markus, Martha Jane Hoerr, '
Ann King, Margaret Osborn, Carol
Jane Thornton, Iris Forsyth, Doris
Westman, Claire Mitchell, Charlotte
Gibner, and Winona Woon. The per
forming fencers were: Carol Mc-
Quilling, Janet Kempenich, Marga
ret Bullard, and Elizabeth Lilienthal.
At 6 o'clock an excellent barbecue
dinner was served after which the
managers for next year were elected
and the all-star awards given. An
nouncement of these appears in an
other column of the Daily. i
