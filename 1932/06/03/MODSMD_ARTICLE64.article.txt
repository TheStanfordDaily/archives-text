# RINTALA AWARDED 1932 GIMBEL PRIZE
## Gold Medal And $25 Given To Four-Sport Man 
### 
The Gimbel Award for the best
mental attitude toward athletics for
1932 has been awarded to Rudy Rin
tala, 1932, a four sport man.
This is the third year the award
has been made. Harlow Rothert re
ceived it in 1930 and Bob Brown in
1931. Jake Gimbel, the donor, made
provision that $25 and a large gold
medal be awarded to a Stanford
athlete each year, not on the basis
of athletic prowess, but for the way
the man has worked with the
coaches for the benefit of the team,
the way he has kept in condition
for the benefit of his school, and his
spirit of co-operation with his team
mates.
Rintala has made his Block S in
four fields, football, track, basket
ball and baseball. He has been an
outstanding player in all these
sports and was captain of the base
ball team this year.
The committee making the award
is composed of Thomas Storey,
chairman; Professor W. B. Owens;
and Dean George B. Culver. Storey
said that the chief things the com
mittee considered were the quali
ties of co-operativeness, usefulness,
and helpfulness in the athlete's re
lations with teammates and coaches.
Keeping in good condition and obey
ing training rules were also im
portant.
Gimbel who makes the awards is
a resident of Santa Monica and is
widely known as a humanitarian,
having given numerous endowments
over the country in recognition of
outstanding mental attitudes.
