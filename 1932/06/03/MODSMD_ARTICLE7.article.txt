# MOLNAR'S "OLYMPIA" WELL PRESENTED BY SWORD AND SANDALS
## 
### 
Mylnar's delightful '"Olympia" was J
given an excellent reading last night j
in the.Little Theatre by Sword and
Sandals.
Outstanding work was done by j
Dorothy Tully, who fitted perfectly i
the role of the Princess. Her voice '
is perfectly modulated, and her na- â– 
turaliness and ease were a joy to j
behold. James Lyons' hero was re
markably well done, and he dis- |
played all the poise and assurance
of an experienced captain of Hus- j
sars.
The minor parts were equally well i
done, Terrence Geddis playing Gen- i
eral Plata-Ettingcn in a natural '
manner. Joseph Wolf and Dave (
Davis were adequate. The rather!
thankless task of reading stage di- J
rections was performed to perfec- j
tion by Dr. Margery Bailey.
Molnar's play was given a skillful j
reading, and one which, despite min- i
or flaws due to over-hasty reading '
of lines, makes the Stanford drama- j
goers eager for more of Sword and
Sandals' efforts.
