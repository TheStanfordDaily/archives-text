HARRUMPH. Hmmm-m-m-m-m
Kaff, kafT.
With the 1.C.A.A.A.A., the Olym
pic Trials, and the Olympic Games
still ahead, all of them to be helc
in California for the first time, Stan
ford's athletic year is far from com
pleted. But with the ogres of finals
; nd sheepskins ahead, "Slants" must
hid you farewell.
It has not been Stanford's most
prosperous athletic year, nor has ii
been the worst. Football season lur
nished both thrills and disappoint
ments. It saw the Indians again lost
a valiant battle to the powerful Tro
jans of U.S.C., and it saw the Colder
Bears, inspired by "Navy Bill" In
gram, triumph in the Big Gam* foi
the first time in seven years.
But there was the glorious clima>
of another successful invasion o
Ihe East, with Dartmouth as tin
victim. There was that unforgettable
thrill, the Allen-to-Colvin combina
tion gave us in the U.C.L.A. game
and there was the satisfaction o.
drubbing a leally strong Minnesota
eleven.
HIGH HOPES of a successful
basketball season were raised
by Coach John Buna's five when
the Indians got off to flying
start with two sensational vic
tories over U.C.L.A. But the al
most unbelievable series of dis
heartening breaks which had
already deprived Buna of much
of his expected strength ton
tinned to assail the Indian
squad, and time and again a
weary coach was forced to re
organize ins team as player af
ter player was hit by injuries
and illness.
At least there was the satis
faction of watching the remnants
of a once great team give the
California five a desperate bat
tic in ti»e final game of the sea
son. And there was a certain
grim delight in seeing that same
crew of Golden Bears trounce
the Terrible Trojans of Silent
Sam Barry in the playoff for the
championship at Berkeley, after
U.C.L.A. had made it possible
by winning the southern series.
TRACK SEASON is still an opei
book. But Ben Eastman has alreadj
shattered two world':; records, wit!
the prospect of more to come. H<
has won three gruelling races ir
one afternoon, and then grinnec
-heepishly and said "Aw, shucks!
afterward.
Bobby Jones has proved a threa
to life .;nd limb by sailing the dis
cus out past the 160-foot mark, anc
Here Laborde has tagged right aloni
behind. Nellie Gray has graduatec
into the 51-foot class in the shot
while Lyman and Laborde have
:.ided in keeping rival collegians ou
ol the scoring column in that event
All of these, along with Bill Millei
and Dud DcGroot in the pole vault
constitute some great Olympic ma
terial.
Ol course there is the other side
>f the picture —the losses to U.S.C
.nd the illnesses ot the slout-heart
•d Ilables brothers; but Les, a'
least, is back in competition, anc
i here seems some slight chance tc
down the Trojans in the 1.C.4-A.
BASEBALL AND TENNIS,
the other major sports, did not
fare too well. The ball-tossers
ended the season with nine
games won and nine lost, but
dropped the California series
and the championship won last
season.
After a strong start, the ten
nis team slumped when Captain
Keith Gledhill went to Honolulu
an ddoctors' orders kept Cos
grove off the courts.
In the minor sporis, however,
Stanford was greatly successful.
Championships were won in
soccer, swimming, g<df. fencing,
ride-shooting, and polo, with
much prospective Olympic ma
terial being developed in sev
eral.
LOOKING FORWARD to nex
year is not a displeasing prospect
The football team will be strongei
and will be armed with a deceptiv
new attack. Washington and Cali

j fornia may also bo stronger than
| last season, but the Huskies will
; have to play here, while Bill Ingram
[ will be without his greatest asset of
last, fall—the psychology of the
under-dog. U.S.C. is losing heavily
by graduation, and probably won't
1 be any stronger than last year, if as
strong.
Basketball season will be an un
-1 certainty—much will depend on
whether or not several important
players return to school by that
time. If they do—leave the rest to
| John Bunn.
With Dink back on the Farm and
! Eastman returning as captain, the
I track team should be inspired to the
' heights next spring. This far in ad
j vance, it looks as if there would be
! a real chance to stop the parade of
j Trojan victories.
AM) WITH that we ll say
I "Au rev«ir" and turn over
"Slants" to B;>1> Wade.

HARRUMPH. Hmmm-m-m-m-m
Kaff, kafT.
With the 1.C.A.A.A.A., the Olym
pic Trials, and the Olympic Games
still ahead, all of them to be helc
in California for the first time, Stan
ford's athletic year is far from com
pleted. But with the ogres of finals
; nd sheepskins ahead, "Slants" must
hid you farewell.
It has not been Stanford's most
prosperous athletic year, nor has ii
been the worst. Football season lur
nished both thrills and disappoint
ments. It saw the Indians again lost
a valiant battle to the powerful Tro
jans of U.S.C., and it saw the Colder
Bears, inspired by "Navy Bill" In
gram, triumph in the Big Gam* foi
the first time in seven years.
But there was the glorious clima>
of another successful invasion o
Ihe East, with Dartmouth as tin
victim. There was that unforgettable
thrill, the Allen-to-Colvin combina
tion gave us in the U.C.L.A. game
and there was the satisfaction o.
drubbing a leally strong Minnesota
eleven.
HIGH HOPES of a successful
basketball season were raised
by Coach John Buna's five when
the Indians got off to flying
start with two sensational vic
tories over U.C.L.A. But the al
most unbelievable series of dis
heartening breaks which had
already deprived Buna of much
of his expected strength ton
tinned to assail the Indian
squad, and time and again a
weary coach was forced to re
organize ins team as player af
ter player was hit by injuries
and illness.
At least there was the satis
faction of watching the remnants
of a once great team give the
California five a desperate bat
tic in ti»e final game of the sea
son. And there was a certain
grim delight in seeing that same
crew of Golden Bears trounce
the Terrible Trojans of Silent
Sam Barry in the playoff for the
championship at Berkeley, after
U.C.L.A. had made it possible
by winning the southern series.
TRACK SEASON is still an opei
book. But Ben Eastman has alreadj
shattered two world':; records, wit!
the prospect of more to come. H<
has won three gruelling races ir
one afternoon, and then grinnec
-heepishly and said "Aw, shucks!
afterward.
Bobby Jones has proved a threa
to life .;nd limb by sailing the dis
cus out past the 160-foot mark, anc
Here Laborde has tagged right aloni
behind. Nellie Gray has graduatec
into the 51-foot class in the shot
while Lyman and Laborde have
:.ided in keeping rival collegians ou
ol the scoring column in that event
All of these, along with Bill Millei
and Dud DcGroot in the pole vault
constitute some great Olympic ma
terial.
Ol course there is the other side
>f the picture —the losses to U.S.C
.nd the illnesses ot the slout-heart
•d Ilables brothers; but Les, a'
least, is back in competition, anc
