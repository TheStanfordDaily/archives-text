# Warner Ends Spring Grid Practice "Satisfied"
## POP SAYS SESSION CHEERS FOOTBALL OUTLOOK FOR 1932 Hillman Stars In Backfield; Caddel Breaks Away For Long Run 
### Maurice Rapf 
"That's all till September 12."
j With these words, Pop Warner j
I wound up yesterday afternoon's j
| scrimmage and thereby terminated |
I the 1932 spring practice session !
J which Warner himself called "ihe |
I best in recent years."
| Four different teams went through j
j their paces for the benefit of some j
! 250 Farm fans who turned out to
1 see what had been developed dur- '
| ing the last few months and most j
I of the spectators went home pretty |
j well satisfied with the Stanford >
{ football outlook for next fall.
Backfield Not Perfect
True enough, the squad didn't 1
j look perfect; it didn't even approach [
I perfection, but the various back- ;
| fields seemed to handle themselves ;
i fairly well and the linemen weve j
i charging hard and breaking up j
! many plays which were originally j
j planned us big ground-gainers, j
j There were several noteworthy fea- i
' tures, however, which gave evi- j
i dence of the fact that Stanford is j
j going to be a dangerous contender j
I in the Pacific Coast Conference this '
I year.
First of all, there was Jack Hill- j
man who gave further proof to I
substantiate Pop's belief that he
{ will be a fullback in the class of
i Rmalling and Nevers before he
j winds up his college career at the i
! end of the 1933 season. Jackie, as j
j Pop calls him, looked like a com- !
I bination of Nevers and Moffat t yes- !
| terday afternoon as he alternated I
, between making shifty runs through j
I tackle and pounding the center for j
i consistent gains.
Blanchard Looks Good
Just as Hillman was probably the ;
: outstanding backfield performer,
j Lee Blanchard, playing center on
i the yellow squad, stood out in the
| line. It was he who was stopping
Hillman, Caddel, Van Del'en, and
the rest of the first string backfield
with constant and irritating regu- j
1 larity. Perfect on the defense, |
j Blanchard should develop into a i
I sensational center with a little more j
] training in blocking and other func
! tions which he must perform on the !
i offense.
