# Warner Ends Spring Grid Practice "Satisfied"
## POP SAYS SESSION CHEERS FOOTBALL OUTLOOK FOR 1932 Hillman Stars In Backfield; Caddel Breaks Away For Long Run 
### Maurice Rapf 
"That's all till September 12."
j With these words, Pop Warner j
I wound up yesterday afternoon's j
| scrimmage and thereby terminated |
I the 1932 spring practice session !
J which Warner himself called "ihe |
I best in recent years."
| Four different teams went through j
j their paces for the benefit of some j
! 250 Farm fans who turned out to
1 see what had been developed dur- '
| ing the last few months and most j
I of the spectators went home pretty |
j well satisfied with the Stanford >
{ football outlook for next fall.
Backfield Not Perfect
True enough, the squad didn't 1
j look perfect; it didn't even approach [
I perfection, but the various back- ;
| fields seemed to handle themselves ;
i fairly well and the linemen weve j
i charging hard and breaking up j
! many plays which were originally j
j planned us big ground-gainers, j
j There were several noteworthy fea- i
' tures, however, which gave evi- j
i dence of the fact that Stanford is j
j going to be a dangerous contender j
I in the Pacific Coast Conference this '
I year.
First of all, there was Jack Hill- j
man who gave further proof to I
substantiate Pop's belief that he
{ will be a fullback in the class of
i Rmalling and Nevers before he
j winds up his college career at the i
! end of the 1933 season. Jackie, as j
j Pop calls him, looked like a com- !
I bination of Nevers and Moffat t yes- !
| terday afternoon as he alternated I
, between making shifty runs through j
I tackle and pounding the center for j
i consistent gains.
Blanchard Looks Good
Just as Hillman was probably the ;
: outstanding backfield performer,
j Lee Blanchard, playing center on
i the yellow squad, stood out in the
| line. It was he who was stopping
Hillman, Caddel, Van Del'en, and
the rest of the first string backfield
with constant and irritating regu- j
1 larity. Perfect on the defense, |
j Blanchard should develop into a i
I sensational center with a little more j
] training in blocking and other func
! tions which he must perform on the !
i offense.
j Ernie Caddel's 50-yard run
! ihrough left tackle would have
brought the spectators to their feet
l had they not been already standing,
j but it was the only time during the
day that the blond halfback, con
j spicuous because of a pair of blaz-
I ing red silk football pants which
|he was trying out, could break
: loose. Ernie showed a tremendous
! amount of speed in this dash but
Lettunich, Kite, and the rest of the
interference made a hole a mile
wide for him.
Five Good Fullbacks
j Despite the fact that Gordy
Campbell, handicapped by an in
' jured knee, Bob Maentz, confined
to the hospital with an appendicitis,
i and Bob Moore, who suffered a
broken ankle in Wednesday's prac
tice, were missing yesterday, there
were still a host of good backs going
through their paces.
Among the fullbacks Stephens,
Hancock, Targhetta, Strong, and
Tod seemed capable enough, while
Sanderson, White, Thompas, and
Flippen handled the ball well from
the halfback position.
Much Fumbling
Coach Warner started play be
tween the red and the green squads.
It was an open game, both teams
doing their share of the fumbling,
but the reds with Trompas, Flippen,
Lipscomb, and Stephens in the
backfield, had the better running
attack, and after a dash down the
sidelines by Trompas, Lipscomb
carried the ball over the goal to
; make the only score registered be-
I tween these two outfits.
The first team, wearing blue jer
seys, and the second squad, with
yellow shirts, then took the field
and the blues proceeded to .••hove
three scores across on the second
string outfit, one by Hillman, then
Caddel's long dash, and finally a
smash over the light side with Kite

I
' coming out of his guard position to
j take the ball.
Few Passes Tried
There were very few passes tried,
due to the fact that no work has
i been spent during the spring prac
i lice on I his type of attack, but de
, .spite the lack of training, two long
; tosses were completed. Stan Ander
j son sent one over the goal line into
j the hands of Hugh Miller, right end
: on the yellows, but Miller caught it
I out of the end zone and nullified
! the touchdown.
i At the very close of the scrim
j mage, Tex Walker, who played
quarterback in the first-string
i backfield, tossed one to Blanchard
jon the one-yard line, from which
! point Kite made his score.
"That's all till September 12."

I ing red silk football pants which

! amount of speed in this dash but

interference made a hole a mile
wide for him.
Five Good Fullbacks
j Despite the fact that Gordy
Campbell, handicapped by an in
' jured knee, Bob Maentz, confined
to the hospital with an appendicitis,
i and Bob Moore, who suffered a
broken ankle in Wednesday's prac
tice, were missing yesterday, there
were still a host of good backs going
through their paces.
Among the fullbacks Stephens,
Hancock, Targhetta, Strong, and
Tod seemed capable enough, while
Sanderson, White, Thompas, and
Flippen handled the ball well from
the halfback position.
Much Fumbling
Coach Warner started play be
tween the red and the green squads.
It was an open game, both teams
doing their share of the fumbling,
but the reds with Trompas, Flippen,
Lipscomb, and Stephens in the
backfield, had the better running
attack, and after a dash down the
sidelines by Trompas, Lipscomb
carried the ball over the goal to
; make the only score registered be-
I tween these two outfits.
The first team, wearing blue jer
seys, and the second squad, with
yellow shirts, then took the field
and the blues proceeded to .••hove
three scores across on the second
string outfit, one by Hillman, then
Caddel's long dash, and finally a
smash over the light side with Kite

I
' coming out of his guard position to
j take the ball.
Few Passes Tried
There were very few passes tried,
due to the fact that no work has
i been spent during the spring prac
i lice on I his type of attack, but de
, .spite the lack of training, two long
; tosses were completed. Stan Ander
j son sent one over the goal line into
j the hands of Hugh Miller, right end
: on the yellows, but Miller caught it
I out of the end zone and nullified
! the touchdown.
i At the very close of the scrim
j mage, Tex Walker, who played
quarterback in the first-string
i backfield, tossed one to Blanchard
jon the one-yard line, from which
! point Kite made his score.
"That's all till September 12."
j With these words, Pop Warner j
I wound up yesterday afternoon's j
| scrimmage and thereby terminated |
I the 1932 spring practice session !
J which Warner himself called "ihe |
I best in recent years."
| Four different teams went through j
j their paces for the benefit of some j
! 250 Farm fans who turned out to
1 see what had been developed dur- '
| ing the last few months and most j
I of the spectators went home pretty |
j well satisfied with the Stanford >
{ football outlook for next fall.
Backfield Not Perfect
True enough, the squad didn't 1
j look perfect; it didn't even approach [
I perfection, but the various back- ;
| fields seemed to handle themselves ;
i fairly well and the linemen weve j
i charging hard and breaking up j
! many plays which were originally j
j planned us big ground-gainers, j
j There were several noteworthy fea- i
' tures, however, which gave evi- j
i dence of the fact that Stanford is j
j going to be a dangerous contender j
I in the Pacific Coast Conference this '
I year.
First of all, there was Jack Hill- j
man who gave further proof to I
substantiate Pop's belief that he
{ will be a fullback in the class of
i Rmalling and Nevers before he
j winds up his college career at the i
! end of the 1933 season. Jackie, as j
j Pop calls him, looked like a com- !

, between making shifty runs through j

and the blues proceeded to .••hove
three scores across on the second
string outfit, one by Hillman, then
Caddel's long dash, and finally a
smash over the light side with Kite

Few Passes Tried
There were very few passes tried,
due to the fact that no work has
i been spent during the spring prac
i lice on I his type of attack, but de
, .spite the lack of training, two long
; tosses were completed. Stan Ander
j son sent one over the goal line into
j the hands of Hugh Miller, right end
: on the yellows, but Miller caught it
I out of the end zone and nullified
! the touchdown.
i At the very close of the scrim
j mage, Tex Walker, who played
quarterback in the first-string
i backfield, tossed one to Blanchard
jon the one-yard line, from which
! point Kite made his score.
"That's all till September 12."
j With these words, Pop Warner j
I wound up yesterday afternoon's j
| scrimmage and thereby terminated |
I the 1932 spring practice session !
J which Warner himself called "ihe |
I best in recent years."
| Four different teams went through j
j their paces for the benefit of some j
! 250 Farm fans who turned out to
1 see what had been developed dur- '
| ing the last few months and most j
I of the spectators went home pretty |
j well satisfied with the Stanford >
{ football outlook for next fall.
Backfield Not Perfect
True enough, the squad didn't 1
j look perfect; it didn't even approach [
I perfection, but the various back- ;
| fields seemed to handle themselves ;
i fairly well and the linemen weve j
i charging hard and breaking up j
! many plays which were originally j
j planned us big ground-gainers, j
j There were several noteworthy fea- i
' tures, however, which gave evi- j
i dence of the fact that Stanford is j
j going to be a dangerous contender j
I in the Pacific Coast Conference this '
I year.
First of all, there was Jack Hill- j
man who gave further proof to I
substantiate Pop's belief that he
{ will be a fullback in the class of
i Rmalling and Nevers before he
j winds up his college career at the i
! end of the 1933 season. Jackie, as j
j Pop calls him, looked like a com- !
I bination of Nevers and Moffat t yes- !
| terday afternoon as he alternated I
, between making shifty runs through j
I tackle and pounding the center for j
i consistent gains.
Blanchard Looks Good
Just as Hillman was probably the ;
: outstanding backfield performer,
j Lee Blanchard, playing center on
i the yellow squad, stood out in the
| line. It was he who was stopping
Hillman, Caddel, Van Del'en, and
the rest of the first string backfield
with constant and irritating regu- j
1 larity. Perfect on the defense, |
j Blanchard should develop into a i
I sensational center with a little more j
] training in blocking and other func
! tions which he must perform on the !
i offense.
j Ernie Caddel's 50-yard run
! ihrough left tackle would have
brought the spectators to their feet
l had they not been already standing,
j but it was the only time during the
day that the blond halfback, con
j spicuous because of a pair of blaz-
I ing red silk football pants which
|he was trying out, could break
: loose. Ernie showed a tremendous
! amount of speed in this dash but
Lettunich, Kite, and the rest of the
interference made a hole a mile
wide for him.
Five Good Fullbacks
j Despite the fact that Gordy
Campbell, handicapped by an in
' jured knee, Bob Maentz, confined
to the hospital with an appendicitis,
i and Bob Moore, who suffered a
broken ankle in Wednesday's prac
tice, were missing yesterday, there
were still a host of good backs going
through their paces.
Among the fullbacks Stephens,
Hancock, Targhetta, Strong, and
Tod seemed capable enough, while
Sanderson, White, Thompas, and
Flippen handled the ball well from
the halfback position.
Much Fumbling
Coach Warner started play be
tween the red and the green squads.
It was an open game, both teams
doing their share of the fumbling,
but the reds with Trompas, Flippen,
Lipscomb, and Stephens in the
backfield, had the better running
attack, and after a dash down the
sidelines by Trompas, Lipscomb
carried the ball over the goal to
; make the only score registered be-
I tween these two outfits.
The first team, wearing blue jer
seys, and the second squad, with
yellow shirts, then took the field
and the blues proceeded to .••hove
three scores across on the second
string outfit, one by Hillman, then
Caddel's long dash, and finally a
smash over the light side with Kite

I
' coming out of his guard position to
j take the ball.
