## Stevens Pleads To Retain Present System Of Training Teams 
### 
; NEW HAVEN, Conn., June 2. (/P) j
iâ€”A plea that Yale varsity and jun- j
i ior varsity football be allowed to
continue "in their present whole
some state" was made today by
Head Coach Mai Stevens,
i Discussing the new athletic pro-
I gram recently announced for the
j university, Stevens in an article in
' the Yale Daily News criticized the
j plan to limit the football schedule
I to five games, confiine practice to
i the regular season and to abolish
j the junior varsity squad. He also
: defended the system of paid coaches.
Opponents Limited
Shortening of the practice period,
, he said, "may eliminate all oppo
j nents who do not adopt a similar
' regulation.
"In addition, Yale players might*
incur numerous and severe injuries,
: since medical authorities and expe-
I rienced trainers agree that football
1 injuries and football accidents tend
j to occur in inverse proportion to
the time spent teaching football
j 'skills.'
; "If a change is made, Yale should
j compete with only those teams
I whose training period is of the same
i length. This may mean the elim
! ination of intercollegiate football at
j Yale."
Asks Scouting Ban
Coaches Stevens recommended
| that "no limitation be made in the
! number of intercollegiate contests
I until the boys who play the game
| express such a desire" and that Yale
I reaffirm her belief in nonscouting,
' but continue to scout those of her
opponents with whom nonscouting
; agreements cannot be arranged."
I He asserted "Yale's ideals in var
! sity sports can best be attained
| through the medium of paid
' coaches" and contended there is "no
j reason why a special stigma should
; be attached to a paid Yale coach
| and not to a paid Yale professor."
An old law still stands prohibiting
riding, driving or leading camels on
Nevada highways.
