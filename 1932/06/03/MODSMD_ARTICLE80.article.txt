# Indian Riders Nose Out New Mexico Team 6-5
## 
### BY BILL MYERS 
Stanford conquered New Mexico's
invading poloists yesterday after
noon, (3—5, but only after Ihc most
bitterly fought match that has ever
been played on the Cardinal field.
Neither team had more than a
one-goal lead at any time during
the game. Stanford went into the
sixth chukker with the score 5-4
against them. Pete Lewis, number
three for the Redshirts, smashed in
a tally to even the score at 5-5,
where it stayed until the last min
ute of play.
Gillham Breaks Loose
Then Pete Gillham at number one
broke loose and drove through the
winning tally in a difficult angle
shot from the corner of the field.
The ball on his first drive lacked
only inches of going through the
wickets, but Gillham thundered on
through a jumble of players and
added the smash that drove the ball
through the wickets and won the
game for Stanford.
The New Mexico Military Insti
tute players were a flashy, hard
riding outfit, but lacked the experi
ence and teamwork of the Card
riders. They became a little excited
at times and got bunched up, while
the Stanford players stayed strung

'out. :<ew Mexico cracked out longer
drives on the average than the
Redshirts, but lacked Ihe passing
; bility to relay the ball on down
the field.
Record Crowd Watches
I The record crowd of the season
watched the match. For besides the
drawing card of the game .itself,
there was Will Rogers, world
j famed comedian, who was watching
! his son Jimmy play a walloping
' game for New Mexico.
Buttered about by autograph
i hunters and news cameramen after
1 the match, Rogers managed to tell
.Li few friends what he thought of
! the game.
"It was one of the hardest games
! I have ever seen," declared Rogers.
! "There aren't many high-goal
1 matches that would give you any
! more thrills than this one.
"Deserved to Win"
"You deserved to win, all right,"
ihe continued. "Our boys couldn't
quite keep up to you in team play.
But I'd like to see a return match
i down in New Mexico next year."
As to whether or not he will send
j his son Jimmy to Stanford when he
j graduates from the Military Insti
-1 tute, Rogers hasn't decided.

game for Stanford.
The New Mexico Military Insti
tute players were a flashy, hard
riding outfit, but lacked the experi
ence and teamwork of the Card
riders. They became a little excited
at times and got bunched up, while
the Stanford players stayed strung

'out. :<ew Mexico cracked out longer
drives on the average than the
Redshirts, but lacked Ihe passing
; bility to relay the ball on down
the field.
Record Crowd Watches
I The record crowd of the season
watched the match. For besides the
drawing card of the game .itself,
there was Will Rogers, world
j famed comedian, who was watching
! his son Jimmy play a walloping
' game for New Mexico.
Buttered about by autograph
i hunters and news cameramen after
1 the match, Rogers managed to tell
.Li few friends what he thought of
! the game.
"It was one of the hardest games
! I have ever seen," declared Rogers.
! "There aren't many high-goal
1 matches that would give you any
! more thrills than this one.
"Deserved to Win"
"You deserved to win, all right,"
ihe continued. "Our boys couldn't
quite keep up to you in team play.
But I'd like to see a return match
i down in New Mexico next year."
As to whether or not he will send
j his son Jimmy to Stanford when he
j graduates from the Military Insti
-1 tute, Rogers hasn't decided.
