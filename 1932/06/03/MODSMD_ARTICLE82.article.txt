KANSAS CITY, June 2. (/P)â€” |
Jobless World War veterans of the
southwest heard a warning against
Communist agitators as they took J
up the trail to Washington today to !
join in a demand for immediate !
cash payment of adjusted compcn- i
sation certificates.
Urged by the national headquar- j
ters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars j
here to stay out of Washington,
former service men of many cities
stuck by their plans.
"Most of these 'bonus marches,'" J
said R. B. Handy, Jr., adjutant gen- !
eral of the organization, "are being i
sponsored and organized by Com- ;
rnunist agents and agitators who call
themselves representatives of the j
Workers Ex-Service Men's League."
His remarks were addressed to
more than 200 veterans who organ
ized here under the leadership of j
M. R. Kennedy. They plan to leave
by freight train Saturday night.
Groups assembled in Denver and
Wichita, Kan. Fifty veterans of j
Tulsa County, Oklahoma, were on
their way east by freight train in :
small bands. ' i
A party of .100 which left El Paso, i
Texas, today encamped at Tucum
cari, N.M. More than 200 left Hous
ton by freight cars.
Oklahoma City, Fort Worth and I
Arnarillo, Tex., were mobilization
points for other veterans seeking
legislative relief.
A group of "bonus marchers" ar
rived today in motor cars at Tex- !
arkana, Tex., the home of Represen- \
tative Wright Patman, sponsor of |
the Bonus Bill. A parade was plan- j
ned in his honor.
