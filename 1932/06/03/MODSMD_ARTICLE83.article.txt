# New Course In Women's P.E. Teaching Scheduled
## 
### 
Looking forward to next year's I
sports days with Mills, California, j
San Jose, etc., the Department of j
Hygiene and Physical Education for j
Women wishes to direct the at- j
tention of upper division students !
to a course which will be given next j
year called Technique of Teaching |
Physical Education Activities. This j
course will provide an excellent j
way of getting the necessary train- !
ing in rules and refereeing for j
qualifying as referees for the Tri- t
angular Sports Day hockey games, j
etc.
Only referees who have passed the i
examinations of the Bay Counties !
Board of Women's Officials are to 1
be allowed to officiate in the games; !
therefore it is highly desirable that |
a number of Stanford's good hockey |
and basketball players enroll in this j
course, fall and winter quarters., i
particularly.
Hockey technique will be given I
in the fall, basketball in the winter, j
and swimming in the spring quar- j
ter. The whole year course is re- j
quired of students qualifying for j
the teaching minor in physical edu
cation. Others may take one, two, j
or three quarters, as desired.
