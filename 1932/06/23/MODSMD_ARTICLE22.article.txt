There are vcrv few, anyhow, and those few are not arbitrary
but based on the foundation tradition of the I'niversilv, which

The visible exemplification of the spirit of democracy al
Stanford is the "hello tradition." That means that every Sinn
ford student greets any other Stafford student svilli a cheerful
"hello" \vhen thev meet. You don'l have lo do il; il is not com
pulsory; bul il is a pleasant custom, worth observing.
A modern simplification is the habit of students driving
automobiles lo pick up other students going lo and fro between
the campus and "I'aiy." It's done as a mailer of course.
One tradition that is never violated al Stanford enjoins all
Stanford students not to smoke on the Quad. The self-imposed
restriction litis existed from the beginning'of the I'niversilv, and
any man with a cigarette in lite arcades stamps himself at once
as no Stanford man.
