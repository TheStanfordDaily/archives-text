Dr. James T. Shot we'll in his Stanford commencement ad
dress violated, he said, a tradition of 800 years by incorporating
no advice in such an address. "Il's 100 laic," he said. All such
valedictory exhortation is probably too lalo, for any high-school
student could formulate practically all of it. The trouble, how
ever. is not with the advice, bill lies in Iho failure to follow what
all know is sound counsel.
Every man his own comoneonionl speaker, I lion. That's easy;
the abundance of maxims in the copy books shows how easy il
is. The hard pari is taking your own good medicine. Still, il
has been done.
