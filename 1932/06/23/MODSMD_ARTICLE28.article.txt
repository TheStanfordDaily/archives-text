LELAND STANFORD. War Governor
of California. Railroad Builder, and
Founder of Stanford University—By
George T. Clark, Director Emeritus,
Stanford University Library. Stan
ford Unniversity Press. $4.
Leland Stanford, like all country
boys of his era, worked on his father's
farm as a matter of course. Mr.. Clark,
in the early pages of his biography of
the founder of Stanford University,
quotes a reminiscence of the governor
concerning these early years. Stanford
It Us how he was helping the hired man
load cordwood. "There was one fellow,"
he says, "who gave me a good deal
of trouble by his steady method. He
would drive his team right up to the
woodpile, never lift his eye off the box
or seat, and go to the end of the wood
pile and begin. When he lifted his eyes
that last stick of wood would be on
t he wagon. At fifteen I could not keep
up with him, my back and shoulders
would give out. At seventeen he could
not keep up with me."
The boy foresljßidowed the man: un
complaining, determined, bending him
self to the task in hand, and inevitably
in the end competent for the achieve
ment of what had been set for him
to do.
In another fifteen years, Stanford
was an established merchant in Sacra
mento. He had been through reverses
and pioneer struggles in the new coun
try and had brought his bride to their
home after a period of three years in
which she stayed at her family home
in Albany. In a letter he wrote: "We
are very comfortable. Jane does all her
own work and has the neatest house in
town. We live well. Have plenty of
Hood coffee, bread, meat, and potatoes,
and such other things as we want."
A modest ideal, and yet at 31 Stan
ford was recognized as a successful
merchant, a public-spirited citizen, and
a leader in some degree in politics. He
was already interested in enterprises
that afterwards brought him fame:
education, a transcontinental railway,
which he regarded as essential for the
development of the state, political
ideals. Before he was 38 he was gov
ernor of California, chosen at the criti
cal time when disunion was threat
ened. As war governor for two years,
he held California stoutly to the prin
ciples of the Republican party of Lin
coln, which he had helped to organize
in the state.
Already he had become one of the
active organizers of the Central Pacific
railroad, launched on his career as
leader of the doughty four who made
the heart-breaking fight to drive the
road across the Sierra Nevada moun
tains and finally won. Clark appropri
ately devotes four of his fifteen chap
ters to this project, from the long years
in which it was a deferred hope of the
people of California, through the bold
assumption of the immense task by
Stanford and his associates when no
others had the daring, the difficulties
of finance and of opposition arising
from political and commercial incen
tives. There is much useful illumina
tion in these chapters; many old
ghosts that have long gibbered are laid.
Then follow chapters on the Palo
Alto Farm and the experiments which
foreshadowed the motion picture, now
commemorated by bronze tablets on
the campus where they were carried
through long before th'ere was a uni
versity here; on the founding of the
University and Stanford's educational
ideals and plans; Stanford's service in
the United Slates Senate, and his
.death.
The book is obviously one that Stan
ford people will want to read and own.
Clark is no less obviously the fit man
to write it. Instinctively a careful and
restrained student, he nevertheless
gained a livelier color for his story
from the fact that Governor Stanford
was a familiar public figure to him
from his boyhood and he gained com
pleteness for it from much material in
correspondence and records that had
rot been hitherto available. —T.E.A.
FIGHTING MEN OF THE WEST—By
Dane Coolidge, E. P. Dutton Co.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Those of us who were raised on
Dane Coolidge's Westerns will wel
come this latest volume, made up
largely of the truth that is stranger
than fiction. Others will find a double

enjoyment in it, both us it introduces
them to one of the foremost writers
of Western stories, and as it provides
a deal of authentic Western history.
Coolidge writes of gunfighters, with
out any particular regard to their being
good men (i.e., sheriffs or other agents
of law and order) or bad. It is enough
that they were fighting men. The book
is the accumulation of 40 years spent
in wandering through the West, listen
ing to the reminiscences of old-timers.
His narratives are presented aS. truth,
and have the ring of truth in them.
THE TREES OF YOSEMITE — By
Marry Curry Tresiddcr, '15, and
Delia Taylor Hoss, '25. Stanford Uni

The chief feature of this unusually
attractive volume is its illustrations.
Mrs. Hoss has succeeded—for the first
time, so far as we know—in using
prints have a depth, a richness, a color

with their subject.
Praise for the artist should not de
tract from the author, however. Mrs.
Tresidder is no less to be commended
for her clear, exact, but readable text-
She describes the trees in a manner
to satisfy the most exacting, but ad
mirably calculated to lead the reader
into sharing her enthusiasm.
The> book covers the trees both of
the valley floor and of the higher
reaches of the Sierra; thus it repre

FIGHTING MEN OF THE WEST—By
Dane Coolidge, E. P. Dutton Co.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Those of us who were raised on
Dane Coolidge's Westerns will wel
come this latest volume, made up
largely of the truth that is stranger
than fiction. Others will find a double

enjoyment in it, both us it introduces
them to one of the foremost writers
of Western stories, and as it provides
a deal of authentic Western history.
Coolidge writes of gunfighters, with
out any particular regard to their being
good men (i.e., sheriffs or other agents
of law and order) or bad. It is enough
that they were fighting men. The book
is the accumulation of 40 years spent
in wandering through the West, listen
ing to the reminiscences of old-timers.
His narratives are presented aS. truth,
and have the ring of truth in them.

of California. Railroad Builder, and
Founder of Stanford University—By
George T. Clark, Director Emeritus,
Stanford University Library. Stan
ford Unniversity Press. $4.
Leland Stanford, like all country
boys of his era, worked on his father's
farm as a matter of course. Mr.. Clark,
in the early pages of his biography of
the founder of Stanford University,
quotes a reminiscence of the governor
concerning these early years. Stanford
It Us how he was helping the hired man
load cordwood. "There was one fellow,"
he says, "who gave me a good deal
of trouble by his steady method. He
would drive his team right up to the
woodpile, never lift his eye off the box
or seat, and go to the end of the wood
pile and begin. When he lifted his eyes
that last stick of wood would be on
t he wagon. At fifteen I could not keep
up with him, my back and shoulders
would give out. At seventeen he could
not keep up with me."
The boy foresljßidowed the man: un
complaining, determined, bending him
self to the task in hand, and inevitably
in the end competent for the achieve
ment of what had been set for him
to do.
In another fifteen years, Stanford
was an established merchant in Sacra
mento. He had been through reverses
and pioneer struggles in the new coun
try and had brought his bride to their
home after a period of three years in
which she stayed at her family home
in Albany. In a letter he wrote: "We
are very comfortable. Jane does all her
own work and has the neatest house in
town. We live well. Have plenty of
Hood coffee, bread, meat, and potatoes,
and such other things as we want."
A modest ideal, and yet at 31 Stan
ford was recognized as a successful
merchant, a public-spirited citizen, and
a leader in some degree in politics. He
was already interested in enterprises
that afterwards brought him fame:
education, a transcontinental railway,
which he regarded as essential for the
development of the state, political
ideals. Before he was 38 he was gov
ernor of California, chosen at the criti
cal time when disunion was threat
ened. As war governor for two years,
he held California stoutly to the prin
ciples of the Republican party of Lin
coln, which he had helped to organize
in the state.
Already he had become one of the
active organizers of the Central Pacific
railroad, launched on his career as
leader of the doughty four who made
the heart-breaking fight to drive the
road across the Sierra Nevada moun
tains and finally won. Clark appropri
ately devotes four of his fifteen chap
ters to this project, from the long years
in which it was a deferred hope of the
people of California, through the bold

LELAND STANFORD. War Governor
of California. Railroad Builder, and
Founder of Stanford University—By
George T. Clark, Director Emeritus,
Stanford University Library. Stan
ford Unniversity Press. $4.
Leland Stanford, like all country
boys of his era, worked on his father's
farm as a matter of course. Mr.. Clark,
in the early pages of his biography of
the founder of Stanford University,
quotes a reminiscence of the governor
concerning these early years. Stanford
It Us how he was helping the hired man
load cordwood. "There was one fellow,"
he says, "who gave me a good deal
of trouble by his steady method. He
would drive his team right up to the
woodpile, never lift his eye off the box
or seat, and go to the end of the wood
pile and begin. When he lifted his eyes
that last stick of wood would be on
t he wagon. At fifteen I could not keep
up with him, my back and shoulders
would give out. At seventeen he could
not keep up with me."
The boy foresljßidowed the man: un
complaining, determined, bending him
self to the task in hand, and inevitably
in the end competent for the achieve
ment of what had been set for him
to do.
In another fifteen years, Stanford
was an established merchant in Sacra
mento. He had been through reverses
and pioneer struggles in the new coun
try and had brought his bride to their
home after a period of three years in
which she stayed at her family home
in Albany. In a letter he wrote: "We
are very comfortable. Jane does all her
own work and has the neatest house in
town. We live well. Have plenty of
Hood coffee, bread, meat, and potatoes,
and such other things as we want."
A modest ideal, and yet at 31 Stan
ford was recognized as a successful
merchant, a public-spirited citizen, and
a leader in some degree in politics. He
was already interested in enterprises
that afterwards brought him fame:
education, a transcontinental railway,
which he regarded as essential for the
development of the state, political
ideals. Before he was 38 he was gov
ernor of California, chosen at the criti
cal time when disunion was threat
ened. As war governor for two years,
he held California stoutly to the prin
ciples of the Republican party of Lin
coln, which he had helped to organize
in the state.
Already he had become one of the
active organizers of the Central Pacific
railroad, launched on his career as
leader of the doughty four who made
the heart-breaking fight to drive the
road across the Sierra Nevada moun
tains and finally won. Clark appropri
ately devotes four of his fifteen chap
ters to this project, from the long years
in which it was a deferred hope of the
people of California, through the bold
assumption of the immense task by
Stanford and his associates when no
others had the daring, the difficulties
of finance and of opposition arising
from political and commercial incen
tives. There is much useful illumina
tion in these chapters; many old
ghosts that have long gibbered are laid.
Then follow chapters on the Palo
Alto Farm and the experiments which
foreshadowed the motion picture, now
commemorated by bronze tablets on
the campus where they were carried
through long before th'ere was a uni
versity here; on the founding of the
University and Stanford's educational
ideals and plans; Stanford's service in
the United Slates Senate, and his
.death.
The book is obviously one that Stan
ford people will want to read and own.
Clark is no less obviously the fit man
to write it. Instinctively a careful and
restrained student, he nevertheless
gained a livelier color for his story
from the fact that Governor Stanford
was a familiar public figure to him
from his boyhood and he gained com
pleteness for it from much material in
correspondence and records that had
rot been hitherto available. —T.E.A.
FIGHTING MEN OF THE WEST—By
Dane Coolidge, E. P. Dutton Co.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Those of us who were raised on
Dane Coolidge's Westerns will wel
come this latest volume, made up
largely of the truth that is stranger
than fiction. Others will find a double

enjoyment in it, both us it introduces
them to one of the foremost writers
of Western stories, and as it provides
a deal of authentic Western history.
Coolidge writes of gunfighters, with
out any particular regard to their being
good men (i.e., sheriffs or other agents
of law and order) or bad. It is enough
that they were fighting men. The book
is the accumulation of 40 years spent
in wandering through the West, listen
ing to the reminiscences of old-timers.
His narratives are presented aS. truth,
and have the ring of truth in them.
