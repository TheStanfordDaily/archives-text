| The decorative illustrations of Joseph
j Paget-Fredericks and the paintings and !
J block prints by the Japanese-American I
I artist, Chiura Obata, which have beeti
j on exhibition at the Stanford Art Gal
j lery from the first of June are to re
main at the gallery until July 10 in-
I .stead of July 1 as was originally sched
! uled. The time has been extended ten
days in order that summer quarter stu- j
dents may have the opportunity to see
these two exhibitions which have been
extremely well-received by gallery '
J visitors.
The Paget-Fredericks collection is
! composed of illustrations for his own I
j writings and the collected works of i
I Edna St. Vincent Millay, settings and
j costumes for the Russian ballet and
j the Paris opera, and portraits of inter
j esting Europeans with whom the artist 1
*he is been associated. Paget-Fredericks J
!is illustraitng a memorial volume to!
j Anna Pavlowa, of whom he was a j
| protege in the Russian ballet, and
! drawings from this volume are on ex
hibition together with several of Pav
lowa's costumes, among them the Swan j
| and Giszelle costumes. Portraits of the !
j exotic Parisiennes, the Baronne Des- j
landes, and the Marchesa Casati, and ,
costume designs for Niginska, Massine, !
I Ida Rubenstein, and Loie Fuller are j
outstanding in the collection. The j
quaintly imaginative illustrations for (
j Paget-Fredericks' books for children
have a child-like grace and fantasy
! comparable in the artistic field to the ,
whimsicalities of Sir James Barrie in
i literature.
Chiura Obata has filled two galleries j
I with paintings and block prints mainly j
iof California subjects painted in the j
! Japanese manner. Years of study un
! der Japanese masters has perfected
1 Chiura's technique in the old manner I
'and his application of the Japanese
artist's technique to the painting of oc- J
I cidental subjects has produced a very
! interesting individual style. The re
j markable versatility of Chiura's art,!
j which ranges from simple impressions
I to detailed and exquisitely decorative
paintings on silk, is a tribute to the
| years of study and practice that the
i artist has devoted to his work.
During the month of July an exhibi- .
tion of original photographs made in
the Indian country fif the southwestern
United States showing Indian pueblo
life and portrait types is to be shown
at the Thomas Welton Stanford Gal
lery. In an adjoining room are to be
