# PARKING VIOLATIONS ARE MORE IN SUMMER THAN AT OTHER TIMES
## Traffic Officer Gordon Davis Warns Students to Keep Eyes Open 
### 
Summer quarter students are guilty
of fewer breaches of campus traffic
regulations in some ways but of more
in some others, according to Gordon
Davis, the campus traffic officer.
Davis is constantly circulating about
the campus roads. You can see him a
long way off, because he drives a
snow-white car. He says he does not
enjoy making arrests, but when he has
to he does it. Violators who have been
stopped by Davis know that he is al
ways quiet and very polite—even sym
pathetic, sometimes —but is clearly of
the opinion that he has a duty to per
form, which is to see that campus auto
mobile regulations are observed, and
that duty he performs.
Student violators of these regulations
when they are arrested on the campus
are reported to the student councils
before whom they must report. These
councils are empowered to fix the pen
alties, subject to the final review of the
president of the University, and those
penalties must be paid. Campus resi
dents who are arrested when off the
campus have to report to regular po
lice courts, of course.
While summer students, Gordon
Davis reports, are far less frequent
violators of the speed regulations on
the campus, strangely enough they are
far worse than students in other quar
ters in failing to pay due regard to
parking rules.
He does not attempt any explanation
of this, but merely reports it as a fact
demonstrated by experience. He mild
ly suggests that courtesy and a due re
gard for the convenience of others
would seem to be enough to avoid most
infraction of parking rules, but adds
that the campus is very fully covered
with signs notifying drivers that cer
tain locations are b'-u'red for parking
purposes, and suggests ti»a + automobile
drivers, especially during the :*ew
days of their residence, until they be
come accustomed to things, keep their
eyes open for these signs before they
leave their cars in possibly prohibited
locations, resulting in their finding a
notice in their cars when they return,
with a consequent requirement of ap
pearing before the council and the vise
less expenditure of a dollar or more
for mere carelessness.
