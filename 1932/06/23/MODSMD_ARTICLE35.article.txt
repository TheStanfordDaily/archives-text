### 
Summer students and faculty can do
much to avoid delays in the delivery pf
their mail the Stanford postoffice offi
cials say.
A large number of errors and omis
sions that might be easily corrected are
responsible for lost time in getting let
ters* to their intended recipients.
In the first place campus people
should notify the postoffice promptly
of their correct address —and not for
get to notify them if they change that
address. A card index is maintained
in the office in order to speed up the
identification of campus residents who
to whom mail is sent with incomplete
01* incorrect address.
The postoffice urges local residents
to warn their correspondents that the
campus postoffice is Stanford Univer
sity and that letters for people who
live on the campus should be addressed
in that form and not to Palo Alto. Es
pecially on mail trains when the clerks
are sorting mail rapidly if the name
Palo Alto catches their eyes, even
though Stanford University also ap
pears they are likely in their haste to
toss a letter -into the Palo Alto rather
than the University sack, which causes
a time-consuming trip to the wrong
postoffice before the letter is relayed
to the campus.
Postoffice boxes are available for
those who desire them; and they should
be rented at once, for the number is
limited. There is carrier delivery on
the campus, and those who want their
mail delivered by that method should
notify the postoffice. The carrier serv
ice is not operated for the dormitories,
however.
