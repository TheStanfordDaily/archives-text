# Urges Students to Budget Their Time and Energies
## 
### 
Wi'hout reserve, Stanford University
bids you welcome. To those students
who have been on the campus previ
ously, this is a homecoming. To stu
dents who are continuing their resi
dence, this is a time for acquainting
others with the traditional Stanford
type of hospitality and friendship. I am
confident that the individual members
of the faculty and the administrative
staff, as well as the students, are united
in the wish that this summer may
prove to be one of keen enjoyment and
real gain.
The summer quarter is an integral
part of the university year. While
there is a minimum of social and ath
letic group activities so typical of
American undergraduate life, never
theless during the summer there are
ample opportunities presented for in
dulging in most forms of sport and
recreation. It is to be hoped that stu
dents will not pass by blindly the nu
merous attractions which must add to
the worthwhileness of a summer spent
on Ihe campus. In no respect, however,
is the summer program an academic
let-down from Ihe so-called "regular"
academic year.
llow can one spend to best advan

tage the few weeks of the quarter? If
past experience means anything, the j
answer is to budget wisely one's time |
and energies. Stanford and her en- j
virons offer sufficient allurement and i
variety to satisfy the most fastidious !
person. The Stanford Daily, published i
twice a week, on Tuesday and Thurs- |
day mornings, is the best medium for j
keeping in touch with local news.
Regular series of events which j
should be noted are the special Tues- j
day evening entertainments, occasional |
musical programs on Friday evenings, j
public lectures by professors on Wed- |
nesday afternoons, organ recitals on j
Sunday and Thursday, nonsectarian j
religious worship on Sunday morning,
and two or three University assem
blies. Among outside attractions arc
especially-scheduled week-end sight- j
seeing trips arranged by a local taxi j
company, and the delightful open air j
symphony concerts at Hillsborough |
given on alternate Sundays.
Need one say more, in expressing at j
the same time the sincere hope that j
your summer at Stanford may be truly i
satisfying?
