# STANFORD STARS DOPED TO GRAB POINTS AT IC4A
## Fate Of Trojan Power Pivoted Around Performance Of Paul, Star Hurdler Card Hopes Pinned On Trio Of "Blazing Ben" Eastman, Butler, Miller 
### Jack Shidler 
You can't raise an argument over in
Berkeley on who is going to win the
1.C.4-A. meet this Friday and Satur
day, but don't count Stanford out of
Ihc running until the points are
counted up!
The mighty Trojan from the Univer
sity of Southern California is slated to
set up a new all-time scoring record
of around GO or 70 points, but there
are more surprises to one of these
intercollegiate meets than any other
in the country.
Ben Leads Indians
First and foremost oi Stanford's sure
point-getters is none other than Blaz
ing Ben Eastman, and he is due for
nine or ten points before they get
Ihrough handing out the ribbons. The
East concedes him a first in the 440,
and MAYBE a second in ihe 880, but
they won't give him two firsts. They
may be right, but Ben learned a lot
in the meet at Philadelphia last year,
and he has picked up an awful lot
more this spring.
His most serious threat in the 440
will come from Carl Warner of Yale,
and in the 880 they count on Pen
Hallowell of Harvard to leave him in
the cinders. Meanwhile S.C. sits back
and waits to see what Ail Woessner
and Ed Ablowitch can do to upset the
Yale menace. They say that Warner
hasn't been pressed this year, but they
might ask Woessner if Eastman has
been pushed.
Hallowell Threatens
In the 880 Hallowell is in for the
race of his life, and he may suffer the
same fate that beset the highly touted
George Bullwinkle last year. Hallo
well's race is the mile and they will
do better to keep him in this where be
can stay back and think out his race.
Eastman doesn't run a half-mile, he
races it! You can't stop to think and
expect to beat Ben.
The East is set to spring a surprise
in the pole-vault with Lee of Yale,
and this is due to take points from
either Stanford or Southern California.
We'll take our bets on Bill Miller. He
won't win in a walk, but he should
win. He is just attaining his best form
of the year after being out most of
the season with a pulled muscle in
his leg; which should relegate Graber
and Pool to a back seat.
If Butler comes through in the broad
jump as he has in the past they may
have to count Stanford in there too.
Boyle of Pennsylvania isn't around this
year, and Barber hasn't been jumping
any too well.
East's Jumpers Good
The Indians will sit back and watch
O'Connor of N.Y.U. and Milan of
Dartmouth take the digits away from
McNaughton and Van Osdel of the
Trojans if they jump according to form
already displayed. And the Cards will
takf a number of points from the boys
in the weights that even the so-called
liberals aren't handing out right now.
And the fans that like their thrills
will get them when East meets West
in the hurdles. Watch S.C. then! II
P;iul is in shape the Trojans will clean
up, and if he isn't they will lose mark
ers that are a necessity in their cam
paign for a fourth crown. This boy
Record of Harvard ought to find Ed
wards Field to his liking, and the Cali
fornia sun isn't going to hurt the East
one little bit!

counted up!
The mighty Trojan from the Univer
sity of Southern California is slated to
set up a new all-time scoring record
of around GO or 70 points, but there
are more surprises to one of these
intercollegiate meets than any other
in the country.
Ben Leads Indians
First and foremost oi Stanford's sure
point-getters is none other than Blaz
ing Ben Eastman, and he is due for
nine or ten points before they get
Ihrough handing out the ribbons. The
East concedes him a first in the 440,
and MAYBE a second in ihe 880, but
they won't give him two firsts. They
may be right, but Ben learned a lot
in the meet at Philadelphia last year,
and he has picked up an awful lot
more this spring.
His most serious threat in the 440
will come from Carl Warner of Yale,
and in the 880 they count on Pen
Hallowell of Harvard to leave him in
the cinders. Meanwhile S.C. sits back
and waits to see what Ail Woessner
and Ed Ablowitch can do to upset the
Yale menace. They say that Warner
hasn't been pressed this year, but they
might ask Woessner if Eastman has
been pushed.
Hallowell Threatens
In the 880 Hallowell is in for the
race of his life, and he may suffer the
same fate that beset the highly touted
George Bullwinkle last year. Hallo
well's race is the mile and they will
do better to keep him in this where be
can stay back and think out his race.
Eastman doesn't run a half-mile, he
races it! You can't stop to think and
expect to beat Ben.
The East is set to spring a surprise
in the pole-vault with Lee of Yale,
and this is due to take points from
either Stanford or Southern California.
We'll take our bets on Bill Miller. He
won't win in a walk, but he should
win. He is just attaining his best form
of the year after being out most of
the season with a pulled muscle in
his leg; which should relegate Graber
and Pool to a back seat.
If Butler comes through in the broad
jump as he has in the past they may
have to count Stanford in there too.
Boyle of Pennsylvania isn't around this
year, and Barber hasn't been jumping
any too well.
East's Jumpers Good
The Indians will sit back and watch
O'Connor of N.Y.U. and Milan of
Dartmouth take the digits away from
McNaughton and Van Osdel of the
Trojans if they jump according to form
already displayed. And the Cards will
takf a number of points from the boys
in the weights that even the so-called
liberals aren't handing out right now.
And the fans that like their thrills
will get them when East meets West
in the hurdles. Watch S.C. then! II
P;iul is in shape the Trojans will clean
up, and if he isn't they will lose mark
ers that are a necessity in their cam
paign for a fourth crown. This boy
Record of Harvard ought to find Ed
wards Field to his liking, and the Cali
fornia sun isn't going to hurt the East
one little bit!
You can't raise an argument over in
Berkeley on who is going to win the
1.C.4-A. meet this Friday and Satur
day, but don't count Stanford out of
Ihc running until the points are
counted up!
