# 2,000 MORE SEATS BUILT INTO STADIUM FOR OLYMPIC MEET
## 
### 
Reconditioned, and with 2000 addi
tional seats, the Stanford Stadium is
ready for the American Olympic Track
and Field Trials. One thousand perma
nent seals have been constructed just
inside the parapet wall which sur
rounds the floor of the Stadium â€”an-
other thousand were "squeezed' in by
a scientific renumbering of the seats.
Tho seats will not have the formerly
troublesome tin tags, for the numbers
arc burnt into the wood. The original
job has been entirely replaced by gal
vanized steel sills and pedestals and
new redwood seat boards.
Work began January 15, and em
ployed 125 men. The contract price for
the entire job was $102,000.
