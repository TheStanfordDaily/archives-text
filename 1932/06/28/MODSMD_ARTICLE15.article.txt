# Katharine Cornell Gives Sidelights On Stage Life
## 
### 
1 The success of "The Barretts of Wim
poie Street" has been a source of great
satisfaction for its star and producer,
| Katharine Cornell, who brought out
' the play against the advice of critics.
| "The enthusiasm of the audiences,"
I she said in an interview for the Daily,
I "goes to prove that Ihe public appre
ciates period plays, and enjoys them
equally as much as I do."
To a question as to how she had*
I trained her voice, she replied: "Voice
i must convey fully half the emotion of
• a role to the audience; consequently,
j I endeavor to make mine one of lights
j and shadows, varying with the intens
! ity of the portrayal."
Never Forgets Self
Miss Cornell went on to say that she
j never throws herself into a role, as is
; so commonly believed to be the pro
cedure of actresses.
I • "I am always beside my character,

following every move she makes, sug
i gesting and encouraging, but I never
forget that I am also myself. Certainly
it gives me a greater scope for ex
pression and a better opportunity for
intelligent portrayal."
Closed Unexpectedly
The lovely heroine of "The Barretts
of Wimpole Street" created a new j
stage tradition when she closed her
play at its height in New York to go
on a tour of the country. She also
closed once before for six weeks while
: she went to Bermuda.
"Being on the stage from the first
| curtain to within three minutes of the
| last was rather tiring," she explained,
j "and then, too, the company needed a
I rest."
| Incidentally, she gave her employees!
the vacation with full pay, which is i
; just another example of why her sue- ;
cess is regarded as unusual, although j
i not at all surprising.
