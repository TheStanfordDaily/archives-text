# NO SHORTAGE SEEN IN CAMPUS WATER SUPPLY THIS YEAR
## 
### 
Unlike the summer of 1931, Stanford
will not suffer from a water shortage
this season. Heavy rains, falling dur
ing the winter months, have filled both
Searsville and Felt lakes.
Searsville lake holds a total of 236
million gallons, while last year at this
time there were only 31 million gal
lons stored there. Felt lake holds at
this time 275 million gallons, as com
pared with only 25 million a year ago.
During the summer of 1931 then
was a distinct water shortage all over
California. At Stanford this shortage
was especially noticeable. However, the
condition was relieved through judi
cious use of the water, and no serious
results followed.
