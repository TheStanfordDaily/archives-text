# HOAX MARKS ROBLE FOR BUTCHER SHOP
## 
### 
In alarming red letters against a
white background, the? "PIGS I" 01!
SALE" appeared in front of Roble
I rjbout 10 p.m., Saturday. Immediately
j arose barnyard noises from the non
! Kosher, non-Catholic boys who had
forgotten what day it was. No transac
tions took place so another marker is
ihalked up to the depression, but many
j are curious.
