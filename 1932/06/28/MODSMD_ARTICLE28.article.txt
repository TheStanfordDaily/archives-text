# A 						CURE FOR THE DEPRESSION
## 
### 
Xinety-nine school ma'ams can't he wronjj: Friday night's
Jolly-up was a success.
The interlude coming without cost was doubly sweet. For
an economical interlude, however strange, is to he particularly
welcomed in this year of the great depression.
During the regular academic year various living groups
sponsored non-profit "Depression Dances." The I'liiversity do
nated the Moor where the dance was to he held. The admission
charge was 15 or 25 cents a student.
The dances were well attended and without doubt they will
again take their place in the social scheme of things here next
fall.
Why should not Ihe summer quarter have its own "Depres
sion Dances"? They provide an excellent way of spending an
evening and if held regularly would greatly encourage limp
poeketbooks.
Attendance al dances of this sort enlarges one's circle of
acquaintances, and thereby makes for greater unity among a
necessary transient group. Anyone can get acquainted with an
orchestra drumming a modern dance hit.
But if the summer quarter is to have these dances, individual
living groups mtisl lake the initiative. Think it over.
