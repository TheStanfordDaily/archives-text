# STANFORD UNION VALUES
## 
### 
One of Iho pleasant experiences afforded 'summer quarter
students is the opportunity for informal associations at tlie
Stanford I'nion. Here lias been created every inducement to
the cultivation of friendship in an atmosphere which removes
self-conscious restraint ami stimulates good talk. A point not
to be ignored is that the dollar will go as far here as elsewhere,
and will purchase an intangible value that is priceless.
