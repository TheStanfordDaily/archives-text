# WHAT ABOUT THE FOURTH?

What are you going to do Monday? It is a holiday, you
know, but, although it was once the custom to assemble around
(lie eloquent gloriliers of American traditions of the past, it is
now considered equally patriotic to drive out on the highways
to see and appreciate the beauty of America today. And for
not a few the message of the mountains or the song of the sea
may have a more enduring effect than any political address.
If you are new to California you inav be almost bewildered
by the many opportunities before you over the week-end of
three days. If you are a native son you still have many places
to see. Three days will give you time to make a hurried trip
to Los Angeles, the slide's largest city; Sacramento, the state
capital; or Yoseinite Valley, California's best-known national
park.
If you have only a day you can drive south to Los Catos,
through the canyon to Santa Cruz and on to Monterey, Pacific
Grove, and Carmel, returning through the Meeker Pass and
San .lose. The hills and forests also invite you to linger along
the Skyline Roulevard or among big trees in La Honda or Rig
Rasin. Hut if you prefer to spend Monday in San Francisco you
can rest in Golden Gate Park, dine in a French, Italian, or
Chinese restaurant, or a sea grotto, and bring the day to a close
by seeing one of the several good plavs now being shown there.
In fact, il might be better to have school on Monday, and
extend the holiday period over the rest of the week.
