# BERKELEY'S CURTAIN-RAISER
## 
### 
Berkeley Ikis been given a championship, Sarazcn has won
(wo golf crowns, and Americans arc winning at Wimbledon,
but Stanford turn their eves to Berkeley, where an
army of athletes will compete in the Intercollegiate A.A.A.A.
track and field meets to be held there July 1 and 2.
The 1 IM2 classic arouses more than the usual widespread
interest, for it is the curtain-raiser for the Olympic (lames,
which will soon draw athletes numbering in the thousands and
spectators numbering in the hundreds of thousands to Los
Angeles Ibis summer. While the usual Kastern challenge to
Western supremacy is always a topic of discussion, most of us
are interested in the results because tliev will reveal the names
of some of the outstanding performers. Then, too, the outcome
of the Berkeley meet may impress foreign athletes with the
obstacles they will encounter in attempting to vanquish the
I Kited Slates.
That Stanford men participating in the Intercollegiate
A.A.A.A., and later in the Olympic (lames, have the whole
hearted support of students attending summer quarter here is a
matter to be taken for granted. They always have, they always
will.
