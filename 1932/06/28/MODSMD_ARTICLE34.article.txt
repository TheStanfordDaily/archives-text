MERRILY WE GO TO lIELL—At the
Stanford.
You don't have to bo in a good hu
mor to enjoy this picture. It won't send
you home talking to yourself either.
In short, it's not heavy drama, but
just a production that provides a thor
oughly satisfying evening's entertain
ment.
The yarn opens with a conventional
drinking bout in a penthouse and from
there follows the antics of a seasoned
reporter in the person of Frederic
March. His support is Sylvia Sydney in
a characterization of the sheltered Miss
who takes to the reporter in spite of
his hard drinking.
This picture is not another lecture,
t nd should appeal to the mature who
like the intricacies of incompatability
in married life. March and Sydney
make a good pair and are the whole
show. It moves along fast and is filled
with laughable situations and appro
priate banter. —B.S.
WEEK-END MARRIAGE — At the
Varsity Theatre.
Faith Baldwin's novel in movie form
discloses that when a wife becomes
the breadwinner, love flies out the
window, that a career isn't as satisfy
ing as a husband's love.
Loretta Young and Norman Foster
are the couple who are forced into
strained relationships when the wife
wins success, and becomes a part-time
wife.
Interesting shorts round out the pro

gram, a Louis John Bartells traveling;
salesman comedy and a Nick Carter ,
detective yarn. —H.R.

Stanford that its Press has on its list j
so useful a contribution from so dis- j
tinguished an author. Dr. Hudson, of
Harvard University, is» recognized as
an authority on international law, and
one of the chief proponents of inter- j
national organization as. represented by ■
the League of Nations, the World
Court, etc. In the present volume he \
gives a lucid account of the develop
ment of such movements to date, with 1
a thoughtful and thought-provoking ,
discussion of the participation and re
sponsibilities of the United States. Any- i
one at all interested in the subject of i
world peace will find this an indis
pensable handbook.
