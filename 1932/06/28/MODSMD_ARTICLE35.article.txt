# OPENING CONCERT OF S.F. SYMPHONY WARMLY PRAISED
## Harty, Guest Conductor, Is Encored After Rendition Of Own Number 
### 
Sir Hamilton Harty, guest conductor
of the Sail Francisco Symphony Or- j
chestra ill the opening concert of the ;
.summer series of the Philharmonic So- J
i iety of San Mateo at the Woodland I
Theatre in Hillsborough Sunday, has [
capacity to express with deep feeling a j
wide ran&e of emotions. But his read- !
ing of the radiantly gay humor of j
"Scherzo Reel" from his own composi- |
lion, ''An Irish Symphony," brought I
heartiest applause from his Sunday af- j
k i noon's audience when it demanded a j
repetition of the number.
In "Polonaise, Arietta and Passaca- !
glia" were blended the musical tem- j
perament of the German Handel, from j
whose compositions the transcription ;
wns made by Sir Hamilton, and lhal
of the Irish composer, himself. It was j
lather Sir Hamilton of sunny disposi- j
tion than Handel, best known for his i
criatorios, that the number seemed to '
express.
, Handel's Work Good
However, there was probably more
of Handel in the music than the hasty
ciitic would discern, for modern re-!
search and performance tend to show !
that in Handel's operatic creation ex- !
ists a real expression of his character j
and genius, a phase of his work that i
has been neglected, due to emphasis on .
the "Messiah" and other oratorios.
Of the Delius piece, "In a Summer
Garden," Sunday's program contained |
these notes by the conductor —"All is j
airy, irresponsible, gay and tender, and j
everything is wayward and fragile; j
but of these apparently disconnected 1
fragments of melody and strange float- I
ing harmonies the composer has known \
how to make a perfect musical picture ]
of a drowsy afternoon in an old Eng- I
lish llower garden." The music is de- !
scribed as a poem for orchestra.
Plays Light Numbers
While the three numbers of lighter
mood seemed specially suited to the j
personality of the conductor, other '
parts of the program gave evidence of
his ability to interpret graver emo
t.onal expression.
The Introduction and Cortege, from '
"Le Coq d'Or" by Rimsky-Korsokow,
the concluding number, was a stirring, j
dramatic presentation of great power. ;
Mozart's famous "Symphony in G
Minor" was given with such ease and i
affable demeanor as to recall Schu
mann's phrase about the swaying Gre- ,
cian grace of the G Minor.
Vivid Moods Portrayed
The selection from Tschaikowsky,
"Fantasia, Francesca da Rimini," i
showed the strange and violent con- i
trasls of mood said to be characteristic j
of the composer'.** race—now full of j
wild and barbarous energy and fiery
intensity, now of an almost maiden
tenderness and ingenuousness, now of;
black and hopeless melancholy.
The next concert of the Woodland j
Theatre series will be Sunday, July i
10, with Bernardino Molinari as guest |
conductor.
