## Card 100 Meter Ace Faces Competition From Kojac 
### 
i Sports writers are consistently spot
-1 ting John McKelvey of the Stanford
>j swiming team as a boy who will make
j a potent bid for a place on the United
Slates swimming team. His specialty
I is the 100 meter event. McKelvey is a
1 world's champion at splashes of 40 and
50 yards.
Other stars bidding for a place in
clude George Kojac, who pressed
| Johnny Weissmuller in many of his
| record-breaking dashes. Mannella
Kallili, Maiolo Kallili, and Curtis Cum
-1 mings of the Los Angeles Athletic Club
j will be trying out. Highland of North-
J western and Schwartz of the Illinois
Athletic Club will also be seen in ac
j tion.
According to Norton Thornton, Stan
! ford swimming coach, the foreign en
! tries, Stephan Barany of Hungary,
j European champion, and A. Boros, also
of Hungary, may cause plenty of trou
ble. Thornton concluded that the
United States should win the 100 meter
swim through the work of Kojac who
had a habit of trailing the great Weiss
l rnuller by a touch in many of his
. races.
