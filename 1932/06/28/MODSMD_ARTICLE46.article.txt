# PAVING, REPAIR WORK NEAR COMPLETION AT UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE
## Assistant Comptroller Says Work Was Held Up By Money Matters 
### 
Repaying of the right-hand road of
the entrance to the University will be
finished this week and the island plan
foi traffic control will then be com
pleted on the Stanford side, according
to Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller, who is in charge of the
work.
Although there will be temporary
confusion due to the jog going into
town, the plan calls for a similar island
or. the Palo Alto side, and when that
is built the two lanes of traffic will
move easily.
Work Held Up
The delay on the Palo Alto side has
been due to financial difficulties. The
city finally raised the necessary funds
by extending the leases of the Stand
f.rd and Shell oil companies and re
ceiving advance payments in return.
As soon as the Shell station is moved,
a road to connect with the left side
ot the University entrance will be built
and an island corresponding to the
one on the Stanford side will be con
structed.
Rows of traffic buttons will be put
nlofig the center of the highway to in
dicate turning-points into Stanford or
Palo Alto. A set of six stop-and-go
signals have already been installed.
Pedestrian crossing zones will be
marked going from the University into
tewn.
State Okelis Plan
The plan was designed by Olmsted
Brothers, landscape architects, and has
been approved by the State Highway
Commission. The scheme was also sub
mitted to Miller L. McClintock, head
of the Albert Erskine Bureau of Re
searc hfor Traffic Control, and Mc-
Clintock, Stanford '18, pronounced it
the best system he had yet seen for
such a problem.
