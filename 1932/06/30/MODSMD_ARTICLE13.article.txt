# SANDOE SCORES AS "BLAYDES" IN MILNE READING
## Sword And Sandals, English Club Give Whimsical Comedy Drama Wolf, Converse, Evans, Turn In Polished Performances At Little Theatre 
### Ben Kagan 
Another success was achieved by
Sword and Sandals and the English
Club in last nights reading of A. A.
Milne's "The Truth About Blaydes."
The theme of the play is woven
about the character of Blaydes, who
for his own benefit and immortality,
purloins the poetry of one of his best
friends. The uncovering of the decep
tion after Blaydes' death, and the com
plications that arise, form the plot.
The first act consists chiefly of ex
position, and has a tendency to drag.
But the second and third acts vindi
cated the efforts of the actors, and
brought out the excellent direction.
Wolf Has Difficult Part
Joseph Wolf, playing the part of A.
L. Royce, turned in one of the best
individual performances. His part,
' straight," was difficult, and Wolf did
it with the naturalness and ease which
always has characterized his work.
Perhaps less expected was the suc
cess of Ruth Evans. Starting with a
rather weak first act, she played the
last scene with sincerity and ease.
Waldo Salt, playing the fussy Wil
liam Conway Blaydes, tried valiantly
to portray his character, but either the
lack of many years, or the monotonous
quality of his voice, made his efforts
fall rather short of an accurate rendi
tion.
Play Selection Questionable
James Sandoe as Blaydes was ex
cellent. Suffice it to say, he filled the
role as well as he has filled his nu
merous other efforts. Peg Converseâ€”
just Peg Convex-se, which infers a
great deal.
Harriet Bellamy and Robert Brauns
as Septima and Oliver, respectively,
completed the cast.
The reading was effective, and well
executed. It falls short of the previous
I Sword and Sandals presentations in
I only one respect. Perhaps this was due
j to the selection of the play, which was
j not quite suitable for this type of read
ing.
