in an interview to the Daily. "VVher- i

j 'dole system.'"
Dr. Shergold went on to say that |
I there is absolutely no robbing of one's j

"One buys insurance against injury |
and death—why not buy it against |
economic depression?" Dr. Shergold j
.said that England has suffered so se- 1
verely lately that she finds this the
only satisfactory answer to her unem

ployment problem.
When questioned upon the disarma
ment program, Dr. Shergold explained
his interpretation. "There is an advan
tage in modern problems, complicated
as they are. We are all neighbors as a
consequence of modern invention, and
all we need for international co-opera
tion is to get rid of fear. Then we can
begin work; until then we must edu
cate youth along those lines."
Like United States
Dr. Shergold expressed his satisfac
tion over the vast natural resources
of the United States and commented
upon their utility.
"I am delighted #with your gregari
ousness," he said. "Good citizens are
recognizing increasingly that the key
to control lies not in policies of isola
tion, but in international co-operation
and intercourse."
