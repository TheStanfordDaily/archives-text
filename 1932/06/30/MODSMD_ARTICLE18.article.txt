### 
"Goethe and Modei-n Literature" was
the subejet of the talk given to an in
terested audience in the Little Theatre,
at 4:15 o'clock Wednesday afternoon,
by Dr. Friedrich G. von der Leyen,
visiting professor of English during the
summer quarter. Dr. von der Leyen
has had work at many of the leading
German universities.
He emphasized the fact that Goethe
was a poet who lived at a time when

these influences, and it was Goethe
who contributed the most to all of
these movements.

"Romanticism, Classicism, and Mod
ernism contributed as much to the art
of Goethe as Goethe contributed to
them," said Dr. von der Leyen. Goethe
was not content with confining him
self to any one period or time; he
veered from the influences of the vari
ous schools into an interpretation of
humanity. Goethe was essentially a
product of Germany, as much as Dante
was a product of Italy, or Shakespeare
of England, according to Dr. von der
Leyen.
"After all," said Dr. von der Leyen,
"Goethe was not only the greatest of
German poets; he was the greatest
poet in the world. Whoever learns the
German language eliminates the ne
cessity of learning any other language.
That- is what Goethe did for German
literature!"
