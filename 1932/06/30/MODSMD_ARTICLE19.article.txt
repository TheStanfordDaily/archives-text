# UNION DINING ROOM, CAFETERIA TO CLOSE MONDAY; CELLAR OPEN
## 
### 
The Union dining room and cafe
teria will be closed Monday, July 4. j
In the Union group, only the Cellar j
will be open.
Miss Christine Rieker, director of
University dining halls, announces that
the dining room is open daily, except
Saturday, whereas the cafeteria is ,
open every day except Sunday.
"We are trying hard to keep the Cel- |
lar open until 10:30 o'clock every night, |
with the exception of Saturday and!
Sunday nights, when it closes at 8 I
o'clock," says Miss Rieker, "but con- |
tinuance of the service hours depends I
on the number of patrons.
"Last year we were able, for the j
first time, to keep the Cellar open un- !
tii 10:30 o'clock during the first eight
weeks of the summer quarter. If pat
ronage permits we shall certainly do
so this year."
