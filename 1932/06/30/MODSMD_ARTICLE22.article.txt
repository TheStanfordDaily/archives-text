# STANFORD IC4-A TEAM PERFORMS FOR TEMPLETON
## Dink Cheered By Showings Turned In By Cardinal Entries In Meet Field Men Expected To Score Heavily; Eastman Picked For Double Win 
### Jack Shidler 
Causing much ado at the Stanford
! track plant yesterday afternoon, Dink
| Templeton dropped in to give thirteen
determined men final encouragement
! in preparation for the 1.C.4-A. meet
tomorrow and Saturday. Templeton has
been ill for many months in Lane Hos
j pital, San Francisco, and his visit was
j a signal for celebration.
Although his move was intended to
be secret, 500 were on hand to watch
Templeton work his athletes for the
i first and last time of the year, as he
: was removed to the hospital immedi
! alely after the workout.
Miller Looks Good
Performances turned in assured Bill
! Miller his place in the pole vault and
| cinched the majority of weight points
! for Stanford, where Nellie Gray, La
-1 borde, Jones, and Lyman will try to
! carry on the clean-up tradition in
I weight events begun by Hartranft,
| Krenz, Rothert, and Hoffman. These,
with Ben Eastman, the most plausible
double winner of the day, complete the
backbone of the possible Indian scor
j ing total, 35 points.
Butler and Ray are capable of adding
j five points more to the Cards' score.
' Ray has had trouble with his arm, but
i ho should place in the javelin, as he
| has enjoyed a two weeks' lay-off. No
one has doped him as a scorer, but he
can spring a surprise if his arm shapes
up in time. Butler has had experience
and might win, as he has in the past.
DeGroot May Place
DeGroot looks the best of the four
remaining men as a point-getter, but
Meier, Herbert, and Giberson wouldn't
jbe training the way they are just to
| get a free ticket to the meet. These
I boys are due for some breaks, and
1.C.4-A.'s have provided plenty in the
I past.
Southern California is due to lose
! some of those fine sixty points gener
j ally attributed to them. Too much de
pends upon the track and with Kiesel
cutting down Wykoff, and with the
| Eastern stars finding the California
i climate and the Edwards Memorial
! track much to their liking, the Tro-
I jans must qualify every man of their
thirty-two strong army in order to
' win.
Over at Berkeley Saturday afternoon
' you and I may be yelling ourselves
Jed in 'the face, cheering a winning
team. Anyway, we who have watched
U.S.C. win in the last few years in
track have learned to get a kick out of
the consolation that great individual
j performances turned in by our men
I offers.

Although his move was intended to
be secret, 500 were on hand to watch
Templeton work his athletes for the
i first and last time of the year, as he
: was removed to the hospital immedi
! alely after the workout.
Miller Looks Good
Performances turned in assured Bill
! Miller his place in the pole vault and
| cinched the majority of weight points
! for Stanford, where Nellie Gray, La
-1 borde, Jones, and Lyman will try to
! carry on the clean-up tradition in
I weight events begun by Hartranft,
| Krenz, Rothert, and Hoffman. These,
with Ben Eastman, the most plausible
double winner of the day, complete the
backbone of the possible Indian scor
j ing total, 35 points.
Butler and Ray are capable of adding
j five points more to the Cards' score.
' Ray has had trouble with his arm, but
i ho should place in the javelin, as he
| has enjoyed a two weeks' lay-off. No
one has doped him as a scorer, but he
can spring a surprise if his arm shapes
up in time. Butler has had experience
and might win, as he has in the past.
DeGroot May Place
DeGroot looks the best of the four
remaining men as a point-getter, but
Meier, Herbert, and Giberson wouldn't
jbe training the way they are just to
| get a free ticket to the meet. These
I boys are due for some breaks, and
1.C.4-A.'s have provided plenty in the
I past.
Southern California is due to lose
! some of those fine sixty points gener
j ally attributed to them. Too much de
pends upon the track and with Kiesel
cutting down Wykoff, and with the
| Eastern stars finding the California
i climate and the Edwards Memorial
! track much to their liking, the Tro-
I jans must qualify every man of their
thirty-two strong army in order to
' win.
Over at Berkeley Saturday afternoon
' you and I may be yelling ourselves
Jed in 'the face, cheering a winning
team. Anyway, we who have watched
U.S.C. win in the last few years in
track have learned to get a kick out of
the consolation that great individual
j performances turned in by our men
I offers.
Causing much ado at the Stanford
! track plant yesterday afternoon, Dink
| Templeton dropped in to give thirteen
determined men final encouragement
! in preparation for the 1.C.4-A. meet
tomorrow and Saturday. Templeton has
been ill for many months in Lane Hos
j pital, San Francisco, and his visit was
j a signal for celebration.
