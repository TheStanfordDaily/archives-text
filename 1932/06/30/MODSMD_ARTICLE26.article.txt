For I lie past several seasons, Pacific Coast teams have con
sistently emerged on the long end of the score in their intersec
tional football Raines. Now football managerial staffs, East and
West, are competing against each other and anions themselves
in a scramble wilder than any football referee's dream, the goal
being a box-ollice receipt somewhere near the total of former
seasons.
Eastern managers received the ball on their five-yard line,
decidedly within the danger zone, and elected to punt; so they
kicked out radio announcers. Spectators are anxiously watch
ing the ball, wailing to see where it will land next fall.
The West has the ball on approximately the twenlv-vard
line; they did not gel thrown for such a great loss last season.
From that position the managers may employ almost any
strategy they wish. With good old offensive drive they are
certain to come out on the long end of their box-ollice score.
The defensive punt will have questionable results. . . . and
there's the play. From where we are silting il looks like a
spinner right through the center . . . ."
The point simmers down to this: the Pacific ('oast Conference
meets in San Francisco tomorrow and Saturday, and one of the
chief problems to be considered is the proposal that game broad
casts be abolished. The Eastern Intercollegiate Athletic Associa
tion banned announcers at its meeting this month, and present
indications are that the Big Ten conference will follow the
East's example.
The East and Middle West favor the move because they
anticipate an increase in the number of football fans who will
sil by their radios during the games this autumn. If the game
isn't on the air, those fans will come to the stadium. Fair logic,
it seems, but poor economics. The radio, next to the news
paper, is the best advertising medium which the game of foot
ball possesses. Radio announcing has been to a great degree
icsponsiblc for the overwhelming popularity and financial suc
cess of the game. What does a business corporation do when
sales decrease? Rather than discharge its advertising staff, it
will appropriate more funds for that department.
As il looks now. Western football moguls are opposed to
taking games off the air. If the ('.oast Conference follows that
strategy at its meeting this week-end, we're betting on the West
to defeat the East in this intersectional box-ollice battle.
