# FRESHMAN WOMEN ON THE SPOT
## 
### 
The arbitrary barring of freshman women from participa
tion in campus dramatics lias 101154 been a sore spot with
regular-term Daily editors. It has remained for the present
summer quarter's Women's Council to be the first to remove
this foolish ban. The five newly appointed members of the
women's executive body are to be commended for granting
freshman women this privilege as one of the provisions of their
initial action.
After all, freshman women are at least the equals of fresh
man men so far as ability to cope with the problems of their
new collegiate existence is concerned; yet the dramatic activi
ties, long barred to the Five Hundred's newcomers, have always
been open to Eneina's first-vear men. It is therefore u]> to the
first-year women to make intelligent use of the privilege in
order thai future frosh classes may also enjoy participation in
dramatics.
