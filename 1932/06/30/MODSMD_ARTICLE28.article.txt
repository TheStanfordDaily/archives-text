The artificially stimulated ballyhoo of politics swells to new
levels today when some. llfil persons calling themselves Demo
crats attempt to nominate a candidate for the presidency of the
I'niled Stales.
In the course of that nomination (if previous conventions
afford any indication) there will be much of cheering and
hissing and demonstrating. At stated times parades will brtvik
forth. And some of the 11 T» 1 who would guide the destinies of
America will battle to carry their state banners in a parade.
Others will fight to keep the stale placards fastened securely 011
the floor. There will be eves blacked and frequent applications
of raw beefsteak.
Several bands will aid the delegates in their deliberations in
playing dance hits and martial airs. At pre-arranged signals the
mammoth pipe organ will add its influence, strips of confetti
will fall, and after a while a new nominee will be selected.
This apparently is the democracy that we learned to praise
in grammar school with our hands placed over our heart as we
devoutly repealed the pledge of allegiance to the government
of the I nited States.
It is possible that political conventions are merely the crys
tallization of the American motif of ballyhoo that is recurrent in
modern advertising, and that this is the kind of government
thai the public really wants.
