# IF YOU ASK ME..

### Ben Kagan 
I was just thinking. That's funny,
yet it's true This time I was
thinking while walking down Palm
Drive one sunny afternoon. I was
thinking to myself, and figuring how
to imagine, or try to imagine that the
gates were beautiful.
I was consoling myself that at least
there was a bench inside the gate
where I could rest if I broke my leg
or something. And then I said to my
self that I would walk through the
road on the left-hand side. I stepped
down in the road. But—funny—there
was no road there. Somebody took it
all away.
<t< <t>
I asked the funny man standing
there what happened to the old road,
and he said he didn't know. He thought
that this was a game they were play
ing and that the other side won, and
it was their turn to take away the
road. And if this side won next time,
they would put it back in again.
•'♦/ 4s)
And then I kept walking to Palo
Alto and thinking some more. And I
wondered why of all places the funny
men picked this place in front of the
University to play in. And I tried to
think of other places to suggest where
the funny men could play, and I found
that there is a lot of sand by Half
Moon Bay. You can go fishing there
if you are tired and don't want to
build any more gates. And in the sand
you can make roads and take them
away much faster than you can here.
<£> <•> ♦ •
And all this worried me. And I
couldn't sleep. But this morning I was
reassured. I read the Daily. The Daily
said that someone said to someone else
that the road would be finished this
week. This means that the funny men
would be through playing—for awhile.
Someone said to someone else that
now they wanted to play on the other
side, because this side was all worn
out. They want to get new people to
piny with, too.
■§>*<§> <v
And then I was thinking some more.
And I was thinking that maybe if the
funny men go to Half Moon Bay and
play there, they might have more fun,
arid they might get more funny men
to play with. But then I was only
thinking.

I asked the funny man standing
there what happened to the old road,
and he said he didn't know. He thought
that this was a game they were play
ing and that the other side won, and
it was their turn to take away the
road. And if this side won next time,
they would put it back in again.

And then I kept walking to Palo
Alto and thinking some more. And I
wondered why of all places the funny
men picked this place in front of the
University to play in. And I tried to
think of other places to suggest where
the funny men could play, and I found
that there is a lot of sand by Half
Moon Bay. You can go fishing there
if you are tired and don't want to
build any more gates. And in the sand
you can make roads and take them
away much faster than you can here.

And all this worried me. And I
couldn't sleep. But this morning I was
reassured. I read the Daily. The Daily
said that someone said to someone else
that the road would be finished this
week. This means that the funny men
would be through playing—for awhile.
Someone said to someone else that
now they wanted to play on the other
side, because this side was all worn
out. They want to get new people to
piny with, too.

And then I was thinking some more.
And I was thinking that maybe if the
funny men go to Half Moon Bay and
play there, they might have more fun,
arid they might get more funny men
to play with. But then I was only
thinking.
