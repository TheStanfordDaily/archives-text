### 
Dr. Robert Adger Law, visiting pro
fessor of English from the University
of Texas, believes that Shakespeare is
more popular today than he has ever
been in the past. In the last year, there
have been more than a hundred books,
and many articles, published on
Shakespeare.
An interesting fact, according to Dr.
Law, is that at one time there was a
warrant out for Shakespeare's arrest
cs a dangerous citizen, but the Bard
of Avon had his revenge by making
hi* enemy a character in one of his
plays.

"The mystery of , Shakespeare is
slowly being solved. New documents
have come to light, and research is
bringing forth new interpretations of
his works. Shakespeare was a definite
product of his time," says Dr. Law,
, whose particular field of interest is a
study of Shakespeare's work and times.
"But because of the universality of his
characters and his splendid under
standing of them, he lives as the great
est of English writers.' 1
Shakespeare wrote for his public and
riot for posterity, according to Dr. Law.
In Shakespeare's work there can be
found allusions to matters of as great
political interest as the Democratic
convention is today.
Dramatic Rivalries
"There was great rivalry between
the different dramatic companies of his
day," explains Dr. Law. "Shakespeare's
c.wn company acted under the spon
sorship of the Earl of Essex, while the
greatest rival company was backed by
Lord Chester."
Though financial conditions do not
permit the production of many of his
plays, his drama and poetry is today
being read and appreciated by the
average man.
Most of us are familiar with only a
few of Shakespeare's works, but it is
true that he wrote about 39 plays,
though the authenticity of some are
yet in doubt. He wrote between the
years of 1588 and 1610, retiring sev
eral years before his untimely death
at the age of 52.
