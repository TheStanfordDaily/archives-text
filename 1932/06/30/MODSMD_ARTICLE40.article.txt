# NEED FREE BOOKS SECRETARY'S PLEA AS SHELVES BARE
## 
### 
It must be that students have for- j
gotten that the bo&k-shelf in the Ad- |
ministration Building is maintained to
supply self-supporting students with
the free use of texts.
Time, a cunning craftsman in evil, is j
steadily sending text after text to the
book sanatorium. Some are necessarily
letired from active service each quar
ter, and unless the stock is replen- i
ished Stanford's traditional book-shelf j
for self-supporting students will be a j
thing of the past.
Mrs. Irene Spenner, employment j
secretary of the University, will ex- i
tend a warm greetitng to any text that j
may be left at her desk in the Ad- i
ministration Building.
