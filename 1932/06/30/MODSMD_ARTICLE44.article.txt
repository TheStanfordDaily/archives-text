# DUGAN ISSUES BAN AGAINST FIREWORKS ON CAMPUS, JULY 4
## 
### 
If Stanford students desire to cele
brate the Fourth of July with the
time-honored custom of tossing around
firecrackers, they'll have to go up to
the bed of Lagunita lake to do their
tossing. Fire Chief Dugan has issued
the above warning to those who con
template this joyful, but hazardous
pastime.
Students are warned to put out all
cigarettes before throwing them from
machines, for there is a distinct fire
hazard present at this time of the year.
"Extreme care and caution should be
taken with all open fires, in order to
lessen the fire hazard," says Chief
Dugan.
