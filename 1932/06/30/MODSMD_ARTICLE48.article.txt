# AMERICAN SWIM TEAM FACES KEEN COMPETITION FROM FOREIGN STARS
## 
### George Meany 
The 400-meter free style swimming
| event in the Olympic Games at Los
! Angeles this summer should be one of
I the greatest races of the Games,
j Competition will be very keen on the
American team. Buster Crabbc, of
j L.AA.C., Maiola Kaliili, and Manuella
Kalili, also of LA.A.C.; Jnnies Gilliula,
; the young marvel from a Detroit high
j school who swims for the Detroit Ath
letic Club; Ted Wiget, Stanford's na
tional collegiate 440-yard champion and
sophomore sensation who has swum
the 440 yards in 4:58.6 seconds; Ray
Buddy of N.Y.A.C.; and Cristy of
! Michigan present the greatest group
j of swimmers that have ever vied for
i honors in one single event.
Pick Three
Three of these men will be chosen
, to represent the United States. Buster
1 Crabbe seems to be Uncle Sam's best
I bet, with any of the group likely to
[ take the other two places. Stanford's
j Ted Wiget, through his Intercollegiate

victory by placing second to Crabbe
I i.i the 500-yard event in the National
j AA.U. meet, has an excellent chance
of making the team.
Alberto Zorilla, of the Argentine,
j the present champion, will be on hand
j to defend his title, but has little chance
i to place in this meet.
Favor Frenchman
i John Taris, the great Frenchman,
j holds the world's record of 4:47 and is
favored to win at Los Angeles.
Japan has a quartet of great middle-
I distance swimmers, all of whom have
1 been swimming the 400 meters under
! 4:50. These Japanese are going to
startle the world in the 1932 Olympic
Games swimming meet.
The winner of the final 400-meter
race at the Olympic Games is hard to
I pick before the race is actually over.
. However, just keep your eyes on the
Japanese boys, Taris of France, and
! Buster Crabbe, James Gilliula, and
i Wiget of the U.S.A.
