# BOY'S HOBBY GROWS INTO WELL-STOCKED STANFORD MUSEUM
## Parents Fulfill Youngster's Dream Of Collecting Unique Obejcts 
### 
A visitor in the Stanford Museum
will find young Leland Stanford's own
collections of unique interest, because
these may be called the germ which
developed into Stanford University.
The boy's hobby was that of collector.
He had apparently determined to de
vote his life to the building of a great
museum, and it seems that the first
thought of his parents, following their
son's death, was to carry out his plan.
The first idea of building a museum
grow, as time passed, into a determina
tion to found a university. However,
the museum was given an integral
place in this new plan.
Child's Toys, Drawings
In the family room may be found a
collection of toys with which Leland
Stanford, Jr., played, and also a col
lection made by the boy after he be
came somewhat older. There are a
number of drawings made by young
Stanford, also a number of wood carv
ings made by him which won distinc
tion at the California State Fair.
A case of material collected by the
family of President U. S. Grant and
presented to the Stanfords may be
found in this family room. Among the
curios in this case is a uniform worn
by General Grant during the Civil
War. He and Senator Stanford were
warm friends.
Family Relics
Many family effects may be found
in a memorial room on the second
floor, as well as articles associated with
the lives of the founders and the early
history of the University. One case
contains articles pertaining to the com
pletion of the first transcontinental
railroad, the Central Pacific, of which
Senator Stanford was president.
The famous last spike driven in the
building of the Central Pacific may be
seen here, also the hammer with which
Senator Stanford drove the spike.
Twenty-three golden double eagles
were used in the casting of this spike. !
These were taken by David Hewes, a
brother-in-law of Mrs. Stanford, to a
San Francisco goldsmith, who cast the
spike and sent it to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the railroad line
ended.
On the golden spike is inscribed the
date, "May 13, 1869." As a result of
delays which frequently could not be
foreseen in pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was actually driven
a few days later.
Prehistoric Fossils
Fossils make up an interesting part
of the displays. A large collection of
these was turned over to the institu
tion by Dr. David Starr Jordan, first
president of the University. A group
of restoration drawings of fossils are
shown, showing how fish looked when
they were alive at a period which
many scientists believe was more than
a million years ago.
An excellent collection of early
American and colonial material may be
found in the museum. It contains a
check written and signed by George
Washington. A musket used by some
patriot of '76 is included in the group.
Oriental Collection
A collection of Oriental antiques
from China and Japan has received
favorable mention. This is known as
the Ikeda group. It was purchased by
Mrs. Stanford from the widow of the
man whose name it bears and who
collected the material.
Other Oriental material of great
value was donated to the Museum by
Timothy Hopkins, an associate of Sen
ator Stanford, and the last of the ori
ginal group of trustees. An Egyptian
collection was gotten together for Mrs.
Stanford by Emil Brusch, curator of
the Museum of Cairo. This has been
evaluated as "very good original ma
terial" by the Egyptologist Saysc. How
ever, a great part of the space in this
room is given over to a display of
European crafts and to articles depict

ing the life of North American Indians.
In still another room is depicted j
early California history. Here one may
see the first railroad locomotive to
steam into California. It is the "Gover- |
r.or Stanford No. 1." As might be sur- j
raised by observation of its capacious
maw, this engine is a wood-burner â€”
at one time called a "hay-burner,"
says Curator Frank B. Lemos, "be
cause the sparks which blew from its j
smoke stack as the engine puffed its
way across the plains frequently set
fire to the tall grass. Ultimately some
ingenious mechanic provided an in
verted funnel with a screen across its
exhaust pipe and in this way the fire
hazard was removed."
New interest is added to the entire i
Museum collection as a result of the ,
publication of a Biography of Leland 1
Stanford by George T. Clark, director |
of University libraries emeritus. This j
volume brings out in a somewhat new j
light many facts regarding the Univer
sity and the Museum.
The building which houses the Mu
seum is interesting, in that it was the
first reinforced concrete structure ever
erected. Friends of Senator Stanford
tried to dissuade him from the idea of ,
erecting a building wholly of iron and j
cement, but without avail. When the ;
work was under way he made fre- i
quent visits to Palo Alto to be sure j
that the cement was properly mixed
and that the reinforcing was done in
accordance with his ideas.
This new type of construction was,
given thorough testing during the j
earthquake of 1906. It is said to have j
withstood the strain better than any j
other building in this vicinity. Wings j
which had been added to the original j
building in later years were badly
damaged.
Marble used in the Museum was
quarried in Amador county, California.
It is hand-carved.
