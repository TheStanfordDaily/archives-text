# TIGERS GET WEBB
## 
### 

Earl Webb, hard-hitting outfielder
of the Boston Red Sox, came to the
Detroit Tigers in a trade that sent
Hoy Johnson and Dale Alexander to
the Boston team. Webb, whose record
of G7 doubles last year broke all rec
ords, is expected to bolster the Ben
gals' attack very materially. He will
play in right field.
