### 
School of Education students at
I their noon luncheon yesterday elected
I Wilbur Knott, president, and Ruth
| Whitehead, secretary, of the Educa-
I tion Club. More than 75 per cent of
j the total registration of 250 cast votes.
Preceding the balloting Dr. Ellwood
1 Cubberley, dean of the School, warned
students to "get to know Stanford, its
; history, traditions, and landmarks, in
i addition to mere classroom knowledge."
Significant, in Cubberley's estima
tion, was the'fact that but a 19 per
i cent drop in the school's enrollment for
! this year had been recorded.
1, 1 l shows that students realize that
the next 10 years will present stiffer
competition than ever before and as a
result adequate preparation is needed,"
the Dean said.
It was the club's first meeting dur
ing the summer session, held in the
Union dining room.
At the conclusion of the meeting Dr.
j Cubberley introduced members of the
j Education Club faculty as a part of
; his "get acquainted" plan.
