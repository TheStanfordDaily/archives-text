# Big Ben Defeated In 440 By Carr; Troy Wins IC4-A
## Southern California Sets New High Scoring Mark of 63 Points; Jones, Miller, Gray, Eastman Score Firsts For Stanford; Wykoff Fakes Century 
### JACK SHIDLER 
EN lost .... That sums up the Stanford feeling about last Saturday's 1.C.4-A.
May he we expected too much; maybe we took too much for granted, but
Westerners knew Ben was unbeatable. For those of us who had seen him win
race after race the thought of another quarter-miler challenging him was a
pipe dream. Ben fought all the way in the 140 and fought to win the 880, bul
we were not used to seeing Ben forced to fight. We were accustomed to watch- 1
I ing a calm smooth runner step into the lead and increase it steadily to the

I finish. The realization that Ben East
man is human is hard to take.
WykofT adherents felt the same way
when Kiesel rumors started this spring.
Southern Cal men were shaken when
the Cal sprinter finished ahead of
Frank in his favorite race at the P.I.C.
meet. Although he was defeated, Wy
kofT showed none of the signs of a
beaten man; alibis were offei-ed, but
they didn't originate in U.S.C. camps.
WykofT will win in the Olympics as
he won in the 1.C.4-A. He is a cham
pion.
Will Win Olympics
Ben Eastman will win in the Olym
pics for the same reason. Carr, Wil
liams, and all the other great "come
through" runners will not beat Ben
I then. No discredit is meant to these
men. Eastman's times, his background
of experience, his heart—these com
bined will prove him the world's best
in the 400 meters.
Southern California established a new
high scoring total for 1.C.4-A.'s of
Twenty Trojans took points in of
the 15 events. Their outstanding per
formances were Wykofl's first in the
100, his second in the 220, and Har
per's unexpected second in the shot.
Barber won the broad jump, and Van
Osdel in the high jump, and Graber
in the pole divided with Stanford and
Eastern schools for first-place points.
Typical of S.C. strength were the hur
dles, where four Southern Californians
scored 12 points.
Labordc Promising
Ben Eastman and Frank WykofT split
high-point honors with nine apiece.
Nellie Gray and Bobby Jones showed
Olympic stuff to score decisive wins in
the shot and discus. Laborde is a po
tential champion and pressed Jones in
the discus by hurling the platter 159
feet, a mark which Jones passed on
his next thx-ow by almost two feet—
Jones' best of the day.
Bill Miller tied for first at 13 feet,
10 inches in the pole vault and barely
missed a try for the world's record at
14 feet, 2% inches. Gus Meier gave his
best efforts to the preliminary heats
but certainly provided thrills before
he won his fifth in the 220 lows.
Indians Lose Jones
Seven Indians scored 33 points in
six events. Six of these men will be
back next year—Jones will graduate,
but Laborde will just move up a notch
in the discus. With ten more points,
Stanford should have a championship
team next year. Lyman will be greatly
improved and Meier and Herbert can
account for a large share of the neces
sary markers.
It's really too far into the future,
next year's 1.C.4A., but the outlook
now predicts the fulfillment, of a long
cherished desire for retaliation upon
Troy; but to have S.C. back in place
at the wailing wall—such a dream de
serves speculation!
