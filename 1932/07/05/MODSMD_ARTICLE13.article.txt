# Thompson Sees Change In Prohibition Laws Soon
## 
### 
Despite the repeal plank in the I
Democratic platform, Professor Walter J
Thompson of the political science de
partment does not anticipate, an out
right repeal of the Eighteenth Amend
ment within the next five or six years.
Ho does feel, though, that the Volstead |
Act may be modified in the very near I
future to allow light wines and beer.
Outright repeal can be secured by !
four methods. The first, which is sel- i
dom used although, according to |
Thompson, it is the best plan, is for j
the movement to be initiated by a two- j
thirds vote of Congress, with subse- I
qucnt ratification by three-fourths of!
state constitutional conventions. A sec
ond possibility is ratification by legis
latures of three-fourths of the states, j
Other Possible Methods
A third, and more # complicated,
method calls for initiation by two- ;
thirds of the state legislatures, approv- j
al by Congress and its recommendation j
for a constitutional convention. After
all this, the proposal would have to be !
ratified either by three-fourths of the j
state legislatures, or a fourth way, by |

three-fourths of the state constitu
tional conventions.
Thompson criticized the Republican
resubmission plank on the basis that
the proposed national referendum
would be cumbersome and confusing.
Thompson believes in national con
trol of liquor in case of repeal. Before
the amendment was passed, the public
policies were constantly interfered with
by saloon and brewery interests in the
state and local governments.
Such a situation would be eliminated
only by governmental control either
directly or through some public ser
vice corporation empowered with com
plete regulation of the liquor supply.
Thompson explained that the corpora
tion scheme would be an effective
means of keeping the dry states free
from unlawful sale or transportation
of intoxicants.
This plan would also tend to reduce
taxes, since the new revenue from
manufacture and sale of liquor would
allow the federal and state treasuries
either to decrease public levies or to
increase public works.
