Dr. Robert E. Swain, acting presi- I
dent of Stanford, participated yesterday
in the dedication of a bronze plaque
in Yosemite in memory of Stephen
Tyng Mather, organizer and first di
x'ector of the National Park Service.
The plaque was unveiled at Happy
Isles in Yosemite on the anniversary j
of Mather's sixty-fifth birthday. The I
memorial bears his likeness and the ;
inscription, "Stephen Tyng Mather,
July 4, 1867 —January 22, 1930. He laid
the foundation of the National Park
Service, defining and establishing the
policies under which its acres shall be
developed and conserved unimpaired |
for future generations. There will never j
come an end to the good that he has |
done."
Simultaneously with the dedication j
at Yosemite, similar ceremonies were ■
also being held in fifteen other nation- i
al parks and monuments throughout !
the United States.
Two of the books published by the j
Stanford University Press, "Oh, Ran- j
ger" and "Big Trees," were dedicated >
by their authors to Mather, and the i
foreword in "Oh, Ranger" was written
by him.
Dr. Swain will return to the campus
today.
