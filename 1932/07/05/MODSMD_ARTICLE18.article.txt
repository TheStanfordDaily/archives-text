the Homeopathic Foundation of Cali
fornia. The University is to receive
two-thirds and the Foundation one
third.
The proceeds from the estate will
not be available until after the deyjh

month be paid to Carlo Serbolisca, for
mer leading man for Eleanora Duse,
and $100 monthly to his aunt, Mrs. Vir

dicil made by Mrs. Emerson about a
month before her death which provided

ruled that this codicil was illegal as it
was written less than thirty days be
fore Mrs. Emerson died.
