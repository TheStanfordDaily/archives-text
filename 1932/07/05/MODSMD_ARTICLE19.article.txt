# OUTDOORS CONCERT FRIDAY FEATURES MEXICAN DANCES
## 
### 
An outdoor concert of Mexican folk
songs and dances will be given at 8
o'clock Friday evening by Mrs. Emilia
Lindeman Rathbun, the Misses Elena,
Bertha, and Clotilde Lindeman, and
Francisco Navarro at the Union Court.
This was erroneously announced as
coming last week.
In the folksongs there appears only
a slight suggestion of erudition cither
as regards the words or music. The
songs have been collected from vari
ous regions of Mexico, and all remain
as simple melodies, the harmony being
always submerged to prevent their
losing that purity which constitutes
their chief charm.
Although violin is used with the
guitar at bailes' and festivals, the
guitar is the most inseparable accom
paniment of the Mexican folksongs,
and there are few adobes in Mexico
without one.
Costumes worn in the first half of
the program are of typical "Indio"
Mexican. They are made of unbleached
muslin and heavily embroidered in red
cross-stitch designs. The head cover
ing is always worn as a protection from
the sun and for a covering of the head
when entering church.
In the last half the costumes are
'China Poblana" ones. These are worn
by the higher classes. At any fiesta or
ball they are common and colorful.
