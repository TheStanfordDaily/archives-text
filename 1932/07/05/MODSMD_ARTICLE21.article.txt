## 
### 
The sports pages are packing an irresistable punch these
days with Hie Olympic (ianics rapidly approaching. Acres of
colnmn space arc being tilled with what the athletes may and
may not do, P>nl there is one tiling better than taking the
scribes' word for it, and that is to go and see the battles for
yourself.
Students at Stanford this quarter have just that opportunity,
when the final American trvouts are held in the Stadium July
Jf> and Hi. Mere the best of the country's track and Held stars
will he fighting j( out for places on the American Olympic
team, and all right in our own hack yard.
An example of the hiiÂ»li caliber of competition to he ex
pected is shown in the fact that in one event, the pole vault, all
15 entrants have leaped l.'l feet (> inches or better in competition
this season. Similar top-notch talent will be on display in other
events.
Stanford athletes will also be prominent in this meet. Hen
Kaslman will hold the spotlight as he lights his way through
five gruelling races in the two days against the nation's best
runners. If Kaslman comes through with this ambitious as
signment he will have proven himself a veritable "iron man."
This is one meet that nobody can afford to miss, for it
affords an opportunity of seeing a track and field classic that
will be as interesting as the Olympic (lames themselves. Prices
are reasonable and all seals are being sold at the gate, on the
basis of first come first served.
