# SUMMER AND THE HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
JI has been a point of greal pleasure with Men's and
Women's Councils in previous summer quarters thai thev have
had to judge very few violations of the Honor System.
Perhaps this is due to the warm weather; or to preponder
ance of more mature students; or to well, most anything.
At any rale, it is a good record, and well worth while up
holding during litis quarter.
