There are many cases of a man who has become ianions
(lining his lifetime, lull (hen forgotten after bis death; there
are 1112111 v other cases oi' men who have been given only posthu
mous recognition; but there are few cases oi a man who has
been famous in life, forgotten for awhile alter he has passed
on, and then, after a period oi years, received widespread tame
as a result of a new appreciation of his works.
Such a man was Ambrose Bierce, '"master oi invective, "the
most hated and the most loved man of the Pacific slope, hated
because he was fearless, loved because he was loyal; Ambrose
liierce, the distinguished man of letters, the unrelenting satirist,
true humorist and true poet." "Bitter" Bierce, himself.
Bierce first attained literary fame while writing in London,
where his caustic humor won him the appellation "Bitter."
When he returned to the tinted States and look up journalistic
work in California he achieved great popularity with his
"prattle" column, which was syndicated in newspapers through
out the country. In this column he is said to have made and
devastated reputations, both literary and political, and his bit
ing comments and pointed satire proved to be the downfall of
many prominent people.
Alter Bierce's mysterious disappearance in Mexico in 1'.)! 1,
however, he was generally forgotten. His collected works, which
had been so popular when published in 11)12, were no longer in
demand. Xo biographers sprang up to write the story of his
life and "Who's Who" dropped him without comment. Ap
parently his writings were considered as applicable only to a
certain time and place, and his presumed death was the signal
for the enshrouding of his influence.
Within the past few years a new conception of "Bitter
Bierce has grown up. I lis satire has been lound to be timeless,
his poetry has the spark of eternal beauty, and his humor is
of the rich variety that never dies. Biographers have com
menced to colled his letters and documents and to write their
books about him, publishers are bringing out new editions of
his works, and California newspaper men are hailing him as
one of the leading factors in early journalism of the Golden
Stale. The present exhibit in the Stanford Library is an ex
ample of the interest now aroused.
Fame has long been regarded as fickle. She has run true to
her reputation with Ambrose Bierce, but now that she is again
smiling on him, il is a good tliiii", for literature and Americana.
