LOVE IS A RACKET—At the Varsity
Theatre.
"Arrowsmith" launched a cycle of
doctor pictures, and now, thanks to
Walter Winchell, we are ofl on another
spree. This time it's the columnist..
"Blessed Event," the first narrative
dealing with the first Broadway scan
dal-morigering, won the "getaway"
handicap as a play. Now Douglas Fair
banks, Jr., stars as a wise-cracking
columnist in "Love Is a Racket."
Crackling conversation catapults the
story along at a rattling good speed.
Young Doug, devoid of makeup, looks
like a human being. When he mouths
crisp, sharp talk there is none of the
hollowness of play-acting. He's a na
tural.
For adornment there is Frances Dee
and Ann Dvorak, who assist the col
umnist in his amours. Fairbanks' solil
oquy of the futility of love, spoken in
a moment of high dudgeon, is a flash
of screen literature. —E.L.
STATE FAIR—By Phil Strong. Cen
tury, 1!).'52. $2.50.
Every year the Frakes, stury lowa
farmers, attend the state fair. There
Strong introduces us to Farmer Lake,
whose sole interest is to have the hog,
Blue Boy, win a first prize. There Me
lissa, the wife, enters her pickles in
the food contest, Margy, the daughter,
feels for the first time the pangs of
"Weltschmerz"—world consciousness—
the son meets and frolics with Emily,
flapper daughter of a race-horse tout.
The fair draws to a close. The Frakes
return to their farm, where for another
year they will live in memories of the
events that happened, and to anticipate
the coming fair.
But in a week's time—the duration
of the fair—Strong reveals all the
Frakes' individual idiosyncracies, long
ings, joys, and sorrows that crystalize
into a glorification of that distinctly
American character, the inhabitant of
the lowa Corn Belt. It is free, too, from
the Seth Parker type of saccharine rus
ticity. —E.L.
BROWN WOMEN AND WHITE—By
Andrew Freeman. The John Day Co.
1932. $3. (At the Stanford Bookstore.)
Some men learn about women
through practical experience. Others
read the corset and hosiery ads. But
Andrew Freeman learned about women
by editing the Bangkok Daily Mail, the
King of Siam's own newspaper.
Sitting at his editorial desk, he
scanned the "copy" before him. It was
a circus of mixed marriages, native
cunning, white snobbery. That was the
sidesh»w.,'ln the menagerie were sacred
whitj)^ which ran amuck,
a»d.: pythons. There was no
only whiskey and soda.
"foreign colony"
beccflß&fiia' tabloid tactics irritated
Freeman now
picture of life in a
sphfSc^OT'-influence. There is no unity
to tnejftbqk: It is a readable conglom
ex-jlliiim'of incidents, thumb-nail biogra
phies, brilliant description, mystery,
and adventure. —E.L.
WESTWARD PASSAGE—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
This is Margaret Ayer Barnes' novel
with Lawrence Olivier as Nick, the
temperamental author who divorces
his wife because he can't write in a

1 crowded flat, doesn't want to be a
father, and dislikes nagging.
Six years after the divorce he meets
his ex-wife and tries to win her back,
even though she is married to someone
else. Ann Harding is (he wife who can't
cope with Nick's erratic temperament.
After ventures into pathos and hero
ics in "East Lynne" and "Girl of the j
Golden West" Miss Harding reverts ]
back to her normal, jaunty, sophisti- i
cated self again, reminding you of her
success in "Holiday." Olivier, a sophis- i
ticated "smoothie" who looks like Ron- j
aid Coleman, is excellent in his moods 1
—irritable yet debonair; moody, yet}
polished. It's his picture. —E.L.
