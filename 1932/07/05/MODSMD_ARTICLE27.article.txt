"Behold, the Swallows findeth out
A place wherein to rest—
Even thine own altars, where she safe '
Her young ones forth may bring."
—Psalm LXXXIV
Here the red tiles on the altars of
learning
Shelter God's things,
Swallows with young brought forth
going, returning,
Parents with wings!
Hundreds of nests, holding little Sky 1
children
Sickle-shaped wings, flashing blue- i
black, bewildering
Earth homes for air things
Small holes for wide wings
Is this God's altar?
Clay-built homes—housing the kings i
of the'airways
Close to the cloisters, and night to the !
stairways
We bring our young things—those)
spirits of air,
In the clay homes we have tried to
prepare
For our sky children,
Young and bewildering,
Earth homes for air things,
Spirits with wide wings
Is this God's altar?
