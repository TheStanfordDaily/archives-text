# IF YOU ASK ME..

### Ben Kagan 
I wanted to find out about love, ;■ • I
went to the movies. That's where 1 wa
told to go if 1 warned to >. i t a good
slant on life. So 1 held my breath aii< i
listened. And the more i lisieried, tin
more 1 learned what love i» like, or i
supposed to be.
Now my emotions were beginning li
get the best of me. The hero wanted .i
kiss, it seems. But the uol was bashful
—she was hesitating. The hero want. i
a kiss, it seems. But the girl didn't
want to give it to him. There w n
too many people around.
But then the hero said: "Kiss mc
and the girl said: "1 don't want ;
sample—l want the? real good: Am.
then I understood. Then i realized thai
THIS was the real life. 1 went home
The thoughts kept flitting through m
mind. "Kiss me"
And speaking of the movies remind:
me of an old saying well, maybe not
so old .... that a bird a day
the gloom away, etc.

Of course I am not trying to jump a
conclusions, but then there must bo
good reason for so popular an indooi
sport. Maybe it's not as useless as i
first appears to be. It might be a .•■igi
of sophistication .... well then, may
be it's disapproval, or maybe the buy
are only playful. At any rate il show:
that the birders are having a goo<
time, and that's something "in this tim<
of "the depression.
Now I have an idea. Since it i . tlx
[policy of the theatre to provide a gooc
(time for everybody, even the birders
and since the birders are here am
-here to stay (latest official report), am
since some people don't like them, am
! their ways of displaying their birdlilc
j emotions (funny people, no?), why no
1 provide a boxlike structure in the thea
! tre where the birders could sit un
j molested, unseen, and unheard, am
j still having a good time.
You wouldn't take the rattle awn;
j from ii baby ....
