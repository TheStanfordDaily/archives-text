# Dyer Stars At Southern Olympic Tryouts
## Former Card Sprinter Ties 100 Meter Mark Rothert and Deacon Qualify for U.S. Finals; Great Meet In Prospect; Nine Cards Entered 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
117f111,E Stanford's Olympic hopefuls were winning and losing and pulling
muscles over at Berkeley Friday and Saturday, an imposing galaxy of
Western athletic club athletes were holding a semi-final Olympiad tryout of
their own in Lang Beach, with Hoc Dyer, former Indian sprinter, in the lime
light. Dyer, using his own standing start, equalled the world's record of 10.4
seconds <>ii lioth days of competition in Long Beach in winning the 100-meter
event The lanky ex-Cardinal annexed another set of first-place markers for
the L.A.A.I'. mantel in the 200 meters, •
negotiating the distance in 21.7 seconds]
in Ih'.* final heal.

Two other Stanford men qualified at
Loin* Beach for the final American
track and field tryouts to be held on
tin- Farm July 15 and l(i -Harlow
Rothert, premier shot-putter of Stan
ford's athletic history, aAd Bud Dea
con, a traditionally hard-luck pole
vaulter of the 1931 Indian squad.
Rothert Wins Second
Rothert placed second to Herman
Brix in the shot-put, with a toss of 50
feet 1 '/a inches, a mark nearly two
feet short of his best distance. Deacon
finished in a lie for second with Rob
inson of Portland at a height of .13
feet G inches, which is a vault just
good enough to let friend Deacon in
lor a lot of jumping at the final try
outs. One of the numerous 13'6" vault
ers in the country will probably have
a chance for third in the forthcoming
meet by soaring some slight fraction
of an inch higher than his rivals.
Les Hables, Stanford's outstanding
sprinter at the start of the late la
mented track season, now A.W.0.L.,
ran into his ordinary bad break at
Long Beach, getting himself eliminated
in the qualifling heats. Too bad for
the plucky Hables that the Olympics
had to come in 1932, his unluckiest
year, which makes it pretty unlucky.
Great Meet Looms
All in all, developments at Berkeley
and Long Beacja over the week-end
point to a very interesting meet at
Stanford a week fr >m Friday. The
finalists from these two semi-windup
meets alone would afford as good a
track meet as one may see in any
.'-Indium on any Saturday. With the
additional stars from the East and
Middlewest, the Stanford fracas will
indeed be the greatest all-AmAican
cinder and sawdust classic since the
Oympic tryout finals at Cambridge in
1928.
Eastman, Carr, and Warner . . . .
WykofT, Kiesel, Metcalfe .... Record,
Payne, Saling, Keller, Stokes, Carls
. . . . The dyed-in-the-wool sports fan
gets a premonitory chill up and down
the vertebrae from thinking of these
great cinder clashes. Eastman, a newly
crowned champion already on the
comeback trail, will enter the 440 as
the underdog for the first time in more
than a year, and the resulting race
should be even greater than the sensa
tional quarter-mile which he dropped
to Carr of Pennsylvania three days
ago.
Nine Cards Qualify
Of Indians and ex-Indians there will
be 9 in the final tryouts: Hec Dyer,
100 and 200 meters; Harlow Rothert,
Nellie Gray. Here Laborde, and John
Lyman, shot-put; Bud Deacon and Bill
Miller, pole vault; Bob Jones and La
borde, discus throw; and Ben Eastman,
400 and 800 meters. Eastman, Gray,
Miller, Jones, and Laborde appear to
be the best bets of this field to wear
the American shield at the interna
tional contests in Los Angeles.

finished in a lie for second with Rob
inson of Portland at a height of .13

good enough to let friend Deacon in
lor a lot of jumping at the final try
outs. One of the numerous 13'6" vault
ers in the country will probably have
a chance for third in the forthcoming
meet by soaring some slight fraction
of an inch higher than his rivals.
Les Hables, Stanford's outstanding
sprinter at the start of the late la

ran into his ordinary bad break at
Long Beach, getting himself eliminated
in the qualifling heats. Too bad for
the plucky Hables that the Olympics
had to come in 1932, his unluckiest
year, which makes it pretty unlucky.
Great Meet Looms
All in all, developments at Berkeley
and Long Beacja over the week-end
point to a very interesting meet at
Stanford a week fr >m Friday. The
finalists from these two semi-windup
meets alone would afford as good a
track meet as one may see in any
.'-Indium on any Saturday. With the
additional stars from the East and
Middlewest, the Stanford fracas will
indeed be the greatest all-AmAican
cinder and sawdust classic since the
Oympic tryout finals at Cambridge in
1928.

crowned champion already on the

the underdog for the first time in more
than a year, and the resulting race
should be even greater than the sensa
tional quarter-mile which he dropped
to Carr of Pennsylvania three days

Nine Cards Qualify
Of Indians and ex-Indians there will
be 9 in the final tryouts: Hec Dyer,
100 and 200 meters; Harlow Rothert,
Nellie Gray. Here Laborde, and John
Lyman, shot-put; Bud Deacon and Bill
Miller, pole vault; Bob Jones and La
borde, discus throw; and Ben Eastman,
400 and 800 meters. Eastman, Gray,

the American shield at the interna
