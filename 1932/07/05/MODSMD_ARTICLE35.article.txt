# Clapp To Swim In U. S. Finals
## Thornton Thinks Card Star Is Team Prospect 
### 
Austin Clapp, Stanford distance-star,
has a good chance to make the Ameri
can Olympic team in the 1500-meter
event, in the opinion of Norton Thorn
ton, University swimming coach.
The selection of the United States
team will be made at Cincinnati, Ohio,
on July 16 and 17. Besides Clapp, other
well-known competitors include Bus
ter Crabbe and Maiola Kalili of the
L.A.A.C., James Gilhula, Detroit A.C.,
Ray Ruddy, N.Y.A.C., and Cristy, the
Michigan flash.
Crabbe, who holds the American
record in the 1500-meter race, is the
favorite. Gilhula is an almost certain
second man, while either Clapp or
Kalili should make up the rest of the
team.
Foreign competition at the Olympic
Games will come chiefly from "Boy"
Charlton of Australia, who is the de
fending champion. Charlton has had a
layoff of several years, but is making
strong progress in his comeback.
Zorilla of Argentina and Zeoike of
Japan are other invading stars who
will threaten America's chances.
