Ted Wiget, Stanford's sensational
middle-distance swimmer, unofficially
| broke two world's records last Thurs
! day night in the Athens Club pool at
Oakland. He swam 400 meters in
j 4:50 1-5 seconds compared with the
j world record of 4:52 flat, held by Al
i berto Zorilla of Argentina. He passed
! the 440-yard mark in 4:53 flat, two
seconds under the world's record of
\ 4:55 set by Arne Borg of Sweden.
; Wiget leaves tonight by plane, for
Cincinnati, Ohio, where he will enter
i the final Olympic swimming tryouts
: on July 16 and 17. He now looms as
j an outstanding favorite to make the
(United States team in the 400-meter
! free-style event.
Wiget first leafned his swimming at
| the Athens Club, under the guidance
of Coach Alvin Kallenki of that club.

He came into prominence as a high
school boy when he won the 440-yard
free-style in the North Coast Section
C.I.S. Championships in 1930. He im
proved with rapid strides until in
1932, his first year of varsity competi
tion, he won the National Collegiate
440-yard championship at Ann Arbor,
Michigan.
Last year, swimming experts were
calling Wiget the greatest prospect
ever developed on the Pacific *Coast
since the days of Norman Ross. A year
ago is coach, Norton Thornton of Stan
ford, claimed that he would be the
next world's champion. He now stands
out as a probable Olympic champion.
