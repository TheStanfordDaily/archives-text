# STANFORD VISIT BY PRESIDENT WILBUR IS YET UNCERTAIN
## 
### 
University officials have no informa
tion as to whether Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, president of Stanford and Secre
tary of the Interior, will visit the cam
pus on his present trip to the Pacific
Coast.
Dr. Wilbur left Washington last
week for an inspection tour of the
Northwest. He will stop first at Glacier
National Park, and from there will ar
rive in Spokane on July 11 to spend
some time looking over the proposed
Columbia River Basin reclamation pro
ject.
It is likely that if time permits Dr.
Wilbur will return to Washington
through California, and in that case he
will probably stop for awhile at Stan
ford.
