Acting on the recommendation of a
committee headed by Dr. Robert E.
Swain, acting president of Stanford.
Dr. J. M. Toner, head of California in
stitutions, has announced that the
$130,000 neuro-pathological laboratory
will be located in San Francisco, rather
than at the Agnew state hospital,
which had' been advocated as a site
by peninsula interests.
Controversy over the location of the
laboratory has been active for months,
and Dr. Toner appointed a committee
of three leading educators, Dr. Swain
as chairman, the Rev. James J. Lyons,
president of the University of Santa
Clara, and Dr. T. W. MacQuarrrie,
president of San Jose State College, to
decide the question.
Dr. Swain, in his letter reporting the
committee's decision, stated that the
ends of the laboratory would be better
served in the center of a large and
cosmopolitan population, with closely
connected library and equipment fa
cilities. He pointed out that the pres
ence in San Francisco of two of the
leading medical schools in the country
—Stanford and University of Califor
nia—would provide excellent resources
for research in the neighboring fields of
medicine, chemistry, psychology, and
similar sciences, and the students and
faculty of these schools would be able
to render much valuable co-operative
service in the psychiatric studies.
