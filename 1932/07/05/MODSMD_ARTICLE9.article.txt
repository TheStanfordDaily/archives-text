# EIGHT PRINCIPALS TO LEAD 'PARADE'
## Stover Works Cast Of 40 For Comic Play 
### 
Of the forty parts in "Parade" only
eight are principals, the others being
character bits which carry the excit
ing, "here today, away tomorrow," at
mosphere of the play, according to Di
rector Frederick Stover.
Against the background of super
salesmen trying to sell the hero of the
hour, "Rock" Hennessey, Olympic
champion, anything from pianos to new
sport shoes; high-powered publicity
men in search of testimonials; radio
broadcast promoters; and the legion of
hero-worshippers, the action of the
play moves swiftly.
The tempo of the well-known march,
"Stars and Stripes Forever," which
can be heard being played by a dis
tant band as the curtain goes up, con
tinues throughout the play, Stover
said.
Appearing in the small character
roles will be: William Quinn, Marian
Jones, Ben Kagan, Nancy Roberts, and
Robert Brauns. The part of Mit
chell, hotel manager, will be played by
Robert L. Myers.
In addition to the typical New York
ers trying to commercialize the Olym
pic star's name will be members of
the hotel staff which give the opening
scene in the telephone room of the
hotel that element of city life por
trayed in "Grand Hotel" lobby scenes.
"Parade" will be presented in the
Assembly Hall at 8:30 o'clock July 15.
