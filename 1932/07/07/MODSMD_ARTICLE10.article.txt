# MACHINE AGE TO REVOLUTIONIZE THEATRE WORLD
## Ashley Dukes, English Drama Critic, Predicts Many Innovations Maintains That Small Houses Will Soon Replace Big Theatres 
### 
Innovations of the machine age have
j revolutionized the possibilities of the
j modern theatre, according to Ashley
I Dukes, English playwright, who spoke
Tuesday evening in the auditorium
j on "Dramatic Writing in the Machnized
| Age."
How technical facilities have made
! il possible to produce plays undreamed
J of in the Elizabethan era was explained
I by (he speaker in the second of the
! Tuesday evening series. Though it
would probably be out of place to do
so, he said, modern theatres can offer
plays with even twenty scenes.
Diversity in Subjects
"Theatre conventions, like images in
! poetry, have become cliche," declared
j Dukes in discussing the unwillingness
lof many" writers of today to ignore
t conventions in drawing from the fields
Jof everyday life. He added that there
is a greater diversity of subject-matter
j than ever before.
"The writer, in his studio, is offered
j a much greater range 'of expression
than was permitted the Elizabethans,"
the playwright explained. "He is not
restricted to the conventional forms of
| tragedy and comedy; he may enter any
of the many fields of realism, expres
i sionism, psychology, or satire to con
! vey his message. His .responsibility is
[ greater, for the spoken image has come
! to be equally important as the visual
image in the ideality of setting."
Technical Knowledge Needed
Writers interested in producing mod-
I em dramas must be thoroughly famil
j iar with the technical facilities of the
j theatres for which they are working,
1 Dukes indicated, otherwise they will
!be unable to adapt their new themes
J and plots to the conditions under which
i they are working.
Declaring that commercialism stands
jin the way of the dramatic writer
[ today, the speaker predicted that many
j of the large theatres, wholly unadapted
I to meet the new needs, will eventually
|be abandoned. He feels experimntal
| work with new ideas can best be pre
' sented in the small playhouse, free from
I the influences that now retard its
| progress.
