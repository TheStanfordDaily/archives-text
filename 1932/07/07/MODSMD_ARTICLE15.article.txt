Flying a Boeing pursuit plane, Pres
ton landed in a field near Palo Alto
late Mondav afternoon. In taking off,
his machine struck a rut and the land
ing gear was ripped off, but he con
tinued his flight, heading for Crissy
Field.
Officials at the Palo Alto airport,
fearing that he might not have realized
the extent of the plane's injury, got in
touch with other landing fields and
asked them to signal Preston that his
landing gear had been torn away.
Preston was aware of the loss, how
ever, and circled about several times
in order to ascertain how much the
plane was weakened. He then lightened
his load by dropping a demountable
tank into San Francisco Bay. Having
done this, he flew to Crissy Field,
stalled his motor a few feet above the
ground, and dropped expertly to the
ground without any further damage.
Preston played on the frosh football
team in 1925, and starred as end on
the varsity for three years. He received
his degree in military science in J9130.
