# BARCLAY LAUDS DEMOCRATS FOR FIRM PLATFORM
## Heralds Plank As Clearest And Most Courageous Since 1918 Feels National Prohibition In Present Form Is Doomed, Solution Unclear 
### 
Characterizing the 1932 Democratic
platform as "more courageous, more
clear, and more honest than any major
party's platform since the World War,"
Dr. Thos. S. Barclay, Stanford political
science professor, today pointed out
principal features of the recent con
vention.
The platform is the briefest that has
been adopted for half a century, being
approximately one-eighth the usual
length. Excluding the prohibition
plank, the platform is based upon Wil
son tradition. "It steers a middle course
between Bryanism and the Western
progressives," says Barclay.
Old Time Platform
Apparently the platform was written
by some of the leaders of the Wilson
administration, notably former Senator
[ Hitchcock, Senator Hull, and A. Mit-
I chell Palmer. The prohibition plank
j was sponsored by Governor A1 Smith
I and his friends. "National prohibition
j in its present form seems doomed,"
j Barclay holds, "but the ultimate solu-
I tion is not clear at present. The Demo
j cratic plank calling for straight repeal
I has simplicity but many will prefer the
| solution which the Republican plank
offers. Both planks, in my opinion, cail
for repeal of the Eighteenth Amend
ment."
Despite statements of the candidates
i of both major parties that economic is
sues should receive first consideration,
j it will be difficult to relegate the pro
-1 hibition issue to a secondary position.
West and South May Unite
The opposition to the nomination of
! Governor Roosevelt for president was
I too scattered to be effective. It. was
' impossible to unite upon a candidate
! against him, while the Democratic
I leaders generally were determined to
prevent a deadlocked convention.
Barclay intimated the nomination of
I Governor Roosevelt might reunite the
j West and South, as in the campaigns
|of 1896 and 1916. However, it would
| be necessary for the Democratic nomi
! nee to secure support in the north -
j eastern section of the United States in
j order to insure a majority in the elec
toral college.
