Just when most of I lie campus were dying of ennui and indi
cations were that social activities as a University function would
be conspicuously absent this summer, Roble made the startling
announcement that a 7-to-8 will be held tonight.
This, being the first attempt to hold a University dance this
quarter — the opening Jolly-up not counting — is deserving of
the well wishes of the student body.
It is but a short step now to the revival of Depression Dances.
It is not necessary to urge visiting students to be on deck at
Roble tonight.
