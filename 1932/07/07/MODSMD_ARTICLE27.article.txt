# WHERE ARE ROOSEVELT BACKERS NOW?
## 
### 
Amid tumultuous cheers, the delegation from California at
l!u Democratic convention switched from Garner to Roosevelt
and started the bandwagon that resulted in the New York
governor's nomination.
William Gibbs McAdoo, chairman of the California delega
tion, basked in the political limelight, while the Roosevelt forces
beamed brightly and nominated (larner for vice-president in
return for the Golden Stale's support.
The California delegation will now return home to work for
their nominee's election, and to modestly accept all the praise
and glory coming to them for their active part at the convention.
Rut what about those Californians who worked hard and
faithfully for Roosevelt in the primaries? The Roosevelt can
didates were defeated and the Garner delegation, led l>v Mc-
Adoo, was chosen. Now, due to political astuteness on McAdoo's
part, Ibis same (larner bunch is silting pretty, while Roosevelt's
original backers are unheralded, unhonorcd, and unsung.
The original Roosevelt supporters must feel somewhat like
a man who writes a line speech, and then sees someone else
deliver it and lake all the credit. II must be a bitter dose to
swallow.
