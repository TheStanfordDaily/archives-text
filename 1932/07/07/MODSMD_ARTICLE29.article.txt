# THE 						STANFORD FARM

### 
Some attributes of rusticity are to be found on the Stanford j
Turin harvest scenes in hay fields, the ranch shack lucked j
behind foliage near the University Press buildings thai is I lie I
home of the Daily, dairy cows grazing on lawny hillsides, an
almost studied disregard for individuality in dress. Hul the;
attribute most characteristic ol rusticity, provincialism, is lack
ing. The Stanford Farm is more cosmopolitan than Hroadwav. j
For continuation ol this observation loal lor a while on the
steps of the library. Here you will meet representatives ol more |
< allures in a half hour than you would encounter on America's
busiest thoroughfare in a month's time !|
surprising revelations of personality. These people will make |
lasting impressions upon you for they will transport you to the
far corners of the earth.
\\ ilhoul traveling beyond these library steps one may meet
jm ex-soldier of the White Armv and a Friend of Soviet Russia,
a Harvard grad and an lowa farmer's son, Ihe crown prince ol j
;i west coast commercial empire, and Ihe son of a Iriend ol
Mooney and Hillings, representatives of all races and most of I
the nations. j
The tradition of the Farm is genuine. II isn't that Ihe shell
only has been kepi, the spirit discarded. Culturally, Ihe Stan-!
ford Farm has always been cosmopolitan. And thai is some- j
thing for those who like paradoxes to ponder.
The gleaming rays of Ihe summer sun bring lorlli many
things, including golden fruits from local orchards, and glials.
These' liny "bcaslics" have turned the swimming pools into
"gnaliloriums."" They're carniverous, too, and its humiliating .
that Stanford students, with their accredited and recognized
high scholarship and sophistication must serve as mere, coin-j
mon "gnat fodder.'
