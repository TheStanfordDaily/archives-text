REUNION IN VIENNA—At the Cur-

ran Tlieatre.
Ina Claire would have been de
lightful in this comedy of Robert E.
Sherwood if the piece had been no
more than a pretty romance in which
love is taken not too seriously, for Miss
Claire is at her best in creating roles
wherein the art of love is frankly ac
cepted its an art.
The play does afford a vehicle for
the expression of Miss Claire's talent
in this respect, but it goes beyond the
cliches of conventional—or unconven
tional -romantic drama and of course
it is this that saves it from being
something like an ordinary movie and
gives Miss Claire an opportunity to
create something more than another
film stereotype.
The playwright and the actor very
convincingly resolve a problem that
has been giving sociologists and psychi
atrists quite a little trouble, and thus
they produce a satire on the professor
and the doctor. All this Miss Claire
brings to her audience with consu
mate skill, assisted remarkably well
by Donald Brian, William Stack, and
a well-rounded supporting cast.
The story is that of two men and a
woman, the latter the wife of an emi
nent Viennese psycholanalyst who has
been successful in treating frustrated
women patients. But the wife, Elena,
is also the former mistress of Rudolph
Maximilian von Hapsburg, who exiled
for the last 10 years has been a taxicab
driver at Nice. The problem arises
when Rudolph returns to Vienna for
a reunion party and wishes to renew
for the night his old relations with
Elena.
Her husband, in sending her to the
party where she will meet her former
lover, believes that she will see in his
present embodiment the emptiness that
was her old life and thus lay the
ghost of memory. But the old image,
as it turns out, hasn't changed at all,
and Elena, try as she does, is unable
to resist its light-hearted but very con
vincing love-making.
The two lovers, being what they are,
could hardly solve the problem dif
ferently, and in the end the psychia
trist husband is wise enough to see
there is no way out of the dilemma.
Thus does the modern dramatist, in
condoning adultery, deny the ethical
implications of the phrase. —C.E.R.

WHISTLING IN THE DARK—At the

Geary, San Francisco.
At last we have a new turn worked
into the familiar mould of a gangland
plot, plus a lead in Ernest Truex who
is all that has been said of him, which
makes 1 his stimulating entertainment.
Truex shares honors with Claire Tre
vor, his perfect complement.
The play gets ofT to a flying start
in the heart of gangland with Harry
Wallace as Big Benny, the gang leader,
losing sleep over the problem of "rub
bing out" the unapproachable crime
commissioner.
How to do this without risking the
bull necks of his personnel is the prob
lem. Truex turns up as the author of
detective yarns and by his own boast
ful estimation, the composer of perfect

murder plots. Without further ado the
author and his fiance are clapped into
Benny's lair to do a little frantic
thinking on the gang's problem with
the crime commissioner.
The situation of writing for dear life
an dfencing with the treachery of a
gang leader is a "natural." It is one
that yields a rich harvest of embarass
ments to Truex, who is a past master
at the role. Refreshing complications
carry the action at a merry pace to a
climax with a snap that would do jus
tice to any show.
Herd's a life-size picture of the
racketeer at home. Flying lead and
lurid butchery are cut to a minimum
(talkies please note) with the result
that the action is vivid and genuine.
