| The Editor, Sir:
| In the April Forum, Governor Wil
ibur Lucius Cross of Connecticut, in
lun article on "Young Men in Politics,"
opined that "the present situation is a
still stronger challenge to robust
American youth .... to take the
initiative, to make up their minds what
our democracy needs, and to use all
their educational equipment and or
ganizing powers to get it .... I have
no hesitation in saying to those who
can stand a cold plunge: Come on inâ€”
the water's fine!"
i Tuesday evening Stanford plungers
I accepted the invitation. The occasion
was the formation of the "Thomas for
' President Club." These men and women,
Ino astigmatic anarchists, revolted at
I inefficiency and demagoguery of did
j dling politicians, realizing that eco
j nomics of 1800 cannot solve problems
iof 1932, inhaled deeply of "die Luft
j der Freiheit," and took a header to
ward the remote and safe shore.
| With no hope of winning this year,
j they give their support to an unpopular
I platform built on reason, not, expe
| diency. They show by their action that
I Stanford is educating a certain propor
! tion of her students to think and to
! act rationally.
Future meetings will be announced
I in your column. Thinking students are
i invited to attend.
James W. Thornton, Jr. ('3O)
