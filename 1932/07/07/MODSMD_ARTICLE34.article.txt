# Opportunities Offered To Exchange Work For Rooms
## 
### 
Several rooms are still available for
men who wish to work for them in-

stead of paying for them, according to
Mrs. Irene Spenner of the Student
Employment Office.
Mrs. Spenner reminds students that
it will be necessary to file a study
card with her if they want employ
ment. Many students who have ap
plied have failed to do this.
