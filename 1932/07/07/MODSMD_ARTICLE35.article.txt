# Postage On Letters Hits New High; Boosted Penny
## 
### 
Starting yesterday, all first-class mail
postage charges were increased. All
letters must now have a three-cent
postage stamp on them, while air mail
letters require an eight-cent stamp.
Students are warned by the campus
post office that all letters without the
necessary stamps will be held in the
dead letter office until paid for.
