# U.S. Olympic Finalists Arriving On Farm
## BRONZED HUSKIES IN CAMPUS STAY AT BRANNER HALL Some 300 Athletes Will Make Farm Headquarters For Coming Trials 
### Jack Shidler 
Thirty-eight sawdust and cinder
artists moved into Branner Hall yes
terday. More will hi flooding the cam
pus and Palo Alto until some '500 lam
ous athletes have established them
:;elves in training for tlu' final tryouts
c,l the American Olympic Team, to be
held in the Stanford Stadium July 16
and 17.
The first contingent was composed
of William Garr, Pen ~Hallowell, Joe
Mdngan, Red Record, Bill O'Connor,
Joe McCluskey, and the rest of the
1.C.4-A. qualifiers.
Gene Venzke, the Pottstown, Pa.,
schoolboy who startled the sports world
with his mile time (his spring, has ar
rived and hopes to run the 1500-meter
race. If he wins at the Olympics he
will be the first American winner in
this event since Mel Sheppard scored
his victory in 1008.
Eastman to Run Once
Ben Eastman will compete in one
event, the 440. The announcement of
Templeton's decision means that .spec
tators will be treated to one of the
greatest races in the history of track
in the United States. The menu is:
Ben 15. Eastman versus William A.
Can*.
Ben lias broken the recognized
world's record in the 440 three times
this year and Can' broke it to give his
first defeat in the 440 or 880 in over
a year. Both of the boys have plenty
of ability but Ben must do his best
to run the Pennsylvania!! right out of
the Stadium and if possible, Ben's the
man for the job. My belief is that Ben
will win by five yards.
Alex Wilson of Notre Dame has run
a 48.1 this year, Karl Warner is still
in the race, and from Long Beach will
come James Gordon, winner of the
Southei'n California semi-finals in 48.3.
Ralph Metcalfe, Marquette Univer
sity's stellar sophomore sprinter, will
be among the best of the American's
in the dashes. Conrad Jennings, his
coach, believes his charge will face his
greatest test in the American Olympic
Tryout finals. And when one glimpses
the names of Johnson, Bennet, Tolan,
Toppino, Bracey, Wykoff, Dyer, and
Kiesel entered and qualified for the
tryout finals, such a belief is easy to
understand.
