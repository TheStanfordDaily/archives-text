An expedition to study the eclipse
on August 31 will be sent by the Lick
Observatory of the University of Cali
fornia. The scientists will make their
headquarters in Fryeburg, Maine,
-which will be in the approximate cen
ter of the shadow path.
Because Ibis will be ihe last total
eclipse observable in the United States
until 11)70, Ihe -university authorities at
Berkeley are taking a great deal of
astronomical equipment and most of
the Lick staff. The eclipse will last
for one minute and thirty-nine seconds,
and will be visible in the New England
states.
