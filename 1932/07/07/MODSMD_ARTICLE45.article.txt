# CORN CROPS TO BE RAISED IN BOTTOM OF LAKE LAGUNITA
## 
### 
Lagunita, upon whose sim
mering surface the residents of Roble
have been wont to gaze pensively, is
j being turned into a sordid, unromantic
| corn field.
The University has leased the lake
j bed for the balance of the summer to
|J. D. "Scotchy" Campbell and Walter
Black. Campbell, '24, was a star back
on Stanford football teams for three
years, being captain in 1923. lie has
j now apparently progressed from the
j pigskin through the sheepskin to the
i cornsilk, and is returning to his Alma
' Mater for research in commercial corn
raising.
The enterprising farmers plan to
raise a ten-acre crop in the lake bottom
before the rains set in. They expect
that the residuary moisture in the bed
will provide fertile soil for the waving
stalks of golden bantam ears, and all
that.
Anyway, instead of the blue waves
of Lagunita (whose muddy waters have
long since evaporated) we v/ill soon
have waves of yellow and green vege
tation, and the swish, swish of water
lapping upon the shore, will be dis
placed by the crunch, crunch of stu
dents gnawing of the ears of corn.
