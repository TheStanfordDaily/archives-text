# TRACK MONOTONOUS, KIESEL YEARNS FOR ACTION AS GRIDDER
## 
### 
Pop Warner had better hire a good
track coach to help him with the Stan
ford football team next fall.
Latest reports are that Bob Kiesel,
California's classy .sprinter, "craves
more action" and is going to try out
for the Golden Bear's football team
after the Olympic Games are over.
In case "Bullet Bob" can't make the
football squad, he may go out for
swimming, which ranks with horse
back-riding as his favorite sport.
When there's nothing else left to do,
he'll get on the track again, although
it lacks enough action to suit him.
Chasing Wykoff would be plenty of
action for most people but not, appar
ently, for Kiesel.
