## Timely Olympics Comedy Set For July 15 
### 
"Minnie," the most sympathetic role
in "Parade," the comedy to be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall Friday
! night, July 15, will be played by Myna
Hughes, who gave an outstanding per
] formance as Mrs. de Salle in "Mrs.
; Bumpstead-Leigh."
Despite the fact that she was born
|and reared in New York City and that
! she has traveled no farther than East
Orange, New York, Minnie looks
! through Main Street eyes at the stream
| of metropolitan life flowing in and out
of the telephone room of a great city
hotel. When Minnie's "gentleman
i friend" died during the Spanish-Amer
ican War, Minnie "just carried on at
i the switchboard because that sort of
j ended everything between us."
Fame Is Contrasted
The ironic contrast between Minnie's
; one evening of glory which came after
,40 years at the telephone board and
! that of Rock Hennessey's fame achieved
' in the several seconds it took him to
j break an Olympic record, is cleverly
j shown by the playwright.
As a foil for the worldly-wise, "give
j nothing, take everything," Irene, the?
I old telephone operator with her simple
| and homey outlook on life rises high
! above the comedy of her role. Even
|if everyone laughs at her, Minnie
! doesn't care. She doesn't see anything
J funny about herself or anything she
says. Let them laugh if they want to,
I is her attitude.

I will attend the show.

under the direction of Frederick
Stover.
