# KOJAC LOOMS AS OLYMPIC WINNER
## Athletic Club Star Should Win Backstroke 
### 
Hopes for a first place In the 100-
meter backstroke at the Olympic
Games in August are being centered
in George Kojak of the New York
Athletic Club. And his capabilities fit
him for the job, according to Norton
Thornton, Stanford swimming coach.
Kojac holds the world record of 1:01
for his favorite distance.. Thornton
holds that no other swimmer will offer
any competition to the N.Y.A.C. dorsal
expert.
Other potential United States team
members in the backstroke event in
clude Taylor Drysdale, Michigan's Na
tional Collegiate champion; Keiber, the
sensational splasher from Maine Town
ship High School; Arthur Hargraves of
the San Francisco Olympic Club; and
the dusky Hawaiian brothers, Manu
ella and Mailo Kalili, who will be rac
ing under the colors of the L.A.A.C.
Thornton picks the United States
swimmers to finish one, two, three
when they meet the world's best at
the Olympic finals. This looks like the
Americans' race, and the Stanford
coach expects to see the Americans
win as easily as they did in the Inter
national meet last summer in Japan.
