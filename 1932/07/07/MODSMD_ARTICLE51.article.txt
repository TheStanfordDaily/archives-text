Keith Gledhill, 1932 Card tennis
team captain, moved into the quarter
finals of the Rhode Island men's singles
championships yesterday, along with
five other seeded stars.
Gledhill, the defending champion, is
picked to regain his title, although he
may be upset by Martin Buxby, Uni
versity of Texas "giant-killer," who
defeated Ellsworth Vines in a match
last spring, and who has eliminated
two stars already in the Rhode Island
tournament.

Five United States senators are for
eign-born. They are: Couzens of Michi
gan and Herbert of Rhode Island, both
born in Canada; Wagner of New York,
native of Germany; Davis of Pennsyl
vania, native of Wales; and Bingham
of Connecticut, who was born in Ha
waii before the islands became Ameri
can territory.
