# MILLER CHANGING VAULTING STYLE
## 
### 
With the Olympic final trials set for
next week-end Stanford's hope in the
pole vault, Bill Millex 1 , who has been
sailing over the bar at 13 feet 10 inches
with regularity for the past month of
the season, and whose try for a new
world record at 14 feet 2 inches at
Berkeley last Saturday was barely
missed by a breeze, has chopped two
feet oft of his pet pole.
Miller got his idea by watching Wirt
Thompson, Yale <star, vault with the
shorter pole at the 1.C.4-A. meet at
Berkeley last week-end and is con
vinced that the shorter pole is worthy
of a try.
The Stanford star believes that the
top of the longer pole which rests on
the shoulder of the vaulter at the top
of his leap acts as a drag to the upward
swing of the body. The Yale ace grips
the very end of his pole and goes over
on a tremendous pull with arms and
shoulders.
Throughout the long season Miller's
vaults have been slowly improving un
til now on the eve of the Olympic
trials he has rounded into the best
form of his career. Many track scribes
are predicting great things for the
Stanford jumper.
