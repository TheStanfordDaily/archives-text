hibit to be held in Room 300 of the
Engineering Building from July 11 to
15, will include some of the most out
standing publications in the educa
tional field of the past year, according
to David Lamson, sales manager.
Of widespread interest is the "Stan
ford Time Record," a device developed
by C. H. Niederhauser of the educa
tion department for recording various
activities which occur over a fixed
period of time.
Lesson Assignment Text
"The Lesson Assignment" by Wil
liam G. Carr, director of the research
division of the National Education As
sociation, and John Waage, counsellor
of the Huntington Beach Union High
School, is another book that Lamson
feels will likely interest school teach
ers and educational executives. It is
the first complete study of the field,
and gives the functions, importance,
and technique of lesson assignments.
The history, organization, and ad
ministration of the platoon school
movement, as developed in the Stan
ford Department of Education, is given
in Roscoe . David Case's "The Platoon
School in America." This study was in
cluded in "Sixty Educational Books of
1931," a list selected by the National
Education Association. The author re
ceived his Ed.D. at Stanford and is at
present superintendent of schools in
Salinas.
Tests Displayed
A number of tests of outstanding
merit are also being shown. Among
them are:
The "O-M Sight-Seeing Test'' which
was developed by Adolph Otterstein,
head of the music department at San
Jose State Teachers College, assisted
by Raymond M. Mosher of the psychol
ogy department of the same school.
Professor Otterstein is a student at
Stanford this summer.
The "Vocational Interest Blank," by
E. K. Strong, Jr., professor in the
Graduate School of Business, and the
"Personality Inventory" by Robert G.
Bernreuter are two other University
Press items to which Lamson calls at
tention. The latter is a sheet based on
high-school, college, and adult norms,
comparing the "introversion-extrover
sion, dominance-submission, and self
reliance-emotional stability character
istics of the subject."
