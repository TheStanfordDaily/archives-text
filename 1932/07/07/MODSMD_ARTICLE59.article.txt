# CUBBERLEY APPROVES CARNEGIE REPORT ON JUNIOR COLLEGE
## 
### 
Professor E. P. Cubberley, Dean of
the School of Education, agrees with
the recommendations of the Carnegie
Foundation in its report on the educa
tional system of California. The report
disapproves extending the courses in
the junior colleges until the facilities
at the State universities at Berkeley
and Los Angeles are exhausted.
To eliminate competition for state
funds the report recommends one gov
erning board for the two universities
and the state teachers colleges.
Professor Cubberley emphasized the
position taken by the report in regard
to the extension of the courses at the
teachers colleges. He does not believe
that the number of students which
Fresno, for example, .sends to Berkeley,
at all warrants the locating of a uni
versity there.
