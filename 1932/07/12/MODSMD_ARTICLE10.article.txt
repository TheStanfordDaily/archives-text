### Charles Beardsley 
Bernardino Molinari, guest conduc-
I lor of (ho San Francisco Symphony
i Orchestra, injected his complete per
sonality into his selections during the
second of the summer series concerts
! at the Woodland Theatre in Hillsbor
ough Sunday.
Opening with the "Suite for String
! Orchestra," from Opera No. 5 by
| Corelli, Signor Molinari drew the
i capacity of lights and shadows from
| the beautiful composition. With a ra.nge
| of emotion quite Italian, he completely
i won the audience by his striking in
' terpretation.
Beethoven and Strauss
i Beethoven's "Symphony No. 1 in C
j major" showed the symphonic crea
i tion in one of its richest forms. The
! humor and mood strike clear upon the
j first blast, while rhythmic devices point
■to the masterful power and charm of
j the other movements.
Brilliant by the fact of its sheer
youth and romance, "Don Juan," the
' tone-poem by Richard Strauss, graphi
! cally depicted the torrent and energy
| of Nicholas Lenau's poem. It is a story
I strong in characterization and imagery,
| carrying the young hero from his
earliest quest to his final disappoint
ment and death. Definite musical
| themes reflect every emotion in tone
-1 psychology, and Signor Molinari's
treatment was powerful and convinc
j ing.
March Concludes Program
"Valse Triste," a strange fantasy by
' the Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius,
j revealed the Italian conductor as a
I tragedian. Swelling with waltz rhythm
j throughout, the composition is wistful
i and dream-like in its quality.
"Scherzo-Pizzicato astinato," Tchai
kowsky, and the "Rakoczy March" by
Berlioz concluded the concert with an
intense climax, while Tschaikowsky's
work was one of three contrasted
themes, one for woodwind, strings, and
brass and kettledrums.

| The next concert of the Woodland
i series will be Sunday, July 24, with
I Molinari again as guest conductor.
