# Senoritas Present Fiesta Program In Union Court
## 
### 
The Stanford Union Court made a
charming and appropriate setting for
Mexican folksongs and dances present
ed Friday night by Mrs. Emilia Linde
man Rathbun, the Misses Elena, Bertha
and Clitilde Lindeman, and Francisco
Navarro. The balcony and colonade
framed patio gave an air of naturalness
to the lilting songs and graceful dances.
In the typical Mexican folksongs, the
four sisters sang the melodies as they
learned them from peasants in various
sections of Mexico. The festive songs,
with their gay liveliness, appealed par
ticularly, and Francisco Navarro joined
in on the refrain, so common in folk
literature, giving a certain zest of feel
ing to the delightful melody of the
verses.
