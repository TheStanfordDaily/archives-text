# Clearing For Post Office Site To Start This Week

Wrecking of the houses on the site
of the new $200,000 post office in Palo
Alto at Hamilton avenue, Gilman and
Waverley streets, is expected to start

Deeds conveying the site to the gov
ernment were signed Saturday, after
a long delay in securing payment from
the Treasury in Washington. Bids for
construction of the building will be
called for soon.
