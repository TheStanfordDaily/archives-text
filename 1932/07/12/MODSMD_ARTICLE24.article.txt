Colored Stars in Meet
Many brilliant colored stars provide
interest in the daily workouts and thn
coming meet. Beginning with Ralph
! Metcall'e of Marquette, who has the
| best chance of being a double winner
in the Olympics of any American con
! tender, because of his marks in the
j 100 and 200 meter dashes, we find in
J the same events Eddie Tolan and John
son of Illinois Normal. These three are
sprinters of top-notch caliber.
John Henry Louis represented Amer 7
j ica in ihe '28 Olympics, running a lap
iin the relay. One of the best high
jumpers is Willis Ward, who leaped
j over G feet 7 inches to win the Evan-
I ston qualifying meet. Beatty of Michi
; gan Normal looks to be the best of
! the 400 meter hurdlers.
Good Broad Jump Marks
1 In the broad jump the colored
i American representative is Ed Gordon
| who was on the '28 Olympic team. He
I is not at his best this year, however,
j which is around 25 feet 6 inches.
; Brooks of Chicago University placed
| second in the N.C.A.A., jumping over
I 25 feet. Brooks of Michigan is a discus
j thrower but his are slim chances in
I this Olympic finals.
This Olympic final will eclipse all
former track meets in records and
thrills. No collection of stellar per
formers has ever before been assem-
I bled and the greatest track dish in
history has been made possible only
by the choosing of America for its
setting.

Colored Stars in Meet
Many brilliant colored stars provide
interest in the daily workouts and thn
coming meet. Beginning with Ralph
! Metcall'e of Marquette, who has the
| best chance of being a double winner
in the Olympics of any American con
! tender, because of his marks in the
j 100 and 200 meter dashes, we find in
J the same events Eddie Tolan and John
son of Illinois Normal. These three are
sprinters of top-notch caliber.
John Henry Louis represented Amer 7
j ica in ihe '28 Olympics, running a lap
iin the relay. One of the best high
jumpers is Willis Ward, who leaped
j over G feet 7 inches to win the Evan-
I ston qualifying meet. Beatty of Michi
; gan Normal looks to be the best of
! the 400 meter hurdlers.
Good Broad Jump Marks
1 In the broad jump the colored
i American representative is Ed Gordon
| who was on the '28 Olympic team. He
I is not at his best this year, however,
j which is around 25 feet 6 inches.
; Brooks of Chicago University placed
| second in the N.C.A.A., jumping over
I 25 feet. Brooks of Michigan is a discus
j thrower but his are slim chances in
I this Olympic finals.
This Olympic final will eclipse all
former track meets in records and
thrills. No collection of stellar per
formers has ever before been assem-
I bled and the greatest track dish in
history has been made possible only
by the choosing of America for its
setting.
