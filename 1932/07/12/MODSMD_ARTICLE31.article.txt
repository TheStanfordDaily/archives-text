Smooth ribbons of concrete highway link Stanford to nearby
points of interest scenic, romantic, historic that have played
a potent part in the development of California.
There is Ml ('.amino Real, the King's Highway, which leads
from the Santa Clara Valley south to the sleepy little missions
of San .luan, San Miguel, and San Luis Obispo, with their relics
and quaint architecture.
There is the Monlerery Ray district, the old military and
spiritual center for the Spanish Californiaiis. Latin architec
ture and frail listing boats and green water remind one of some
little Mediterranean fishing village. Revond is Garmel, rendez
vous of California's literati and intelligensia.
To the north is .lack London's Valley of the Moon; in Sonoma
county, headquarters of the Rear Flag Revolution, where the
colors of live nations Spain, Mexico, Russia, the California
Republic, and Jhe I nited States, have waved. Nearby is the
home of Luther Rurhank, the horticulturist, in Santa Rosa.
There is the state capitol at Sacramento, and Sutler's Fort,
and Coloma, where gold was discovered. And there is the
Mother Lode country, in the interior, 011 the rolling Sierra
foothills, dolled with mining towns, once booming, now de
serted, slill carrying the names of Grub Gulch, Whiskey Flat,
and llangtown.
And there is Tahoe, the deep blues and greens of its shim
mering surface that convinced Mark Twain il was more beauti
ful than Lake Como. The Yoscmite, with its lofly granite domes,
its forest meadows, silvery waterfalls that crash down hundreds
of feel, is another scenic attraction. There is San Francisco,
cosmopolitan, yet provincial, with its North Reach, Chinatown,
waterfront, and Golden Gate.
Here arc places within easy driving distance, steeped in
glamorous romance dark-eyed senoritas, dashing army officers,
buckskin-clad sellers; a region that, within a score of miles
changes in name from the "Switzerland of America" to the
"Netherlands of America." Here is a region steeped in rich
historical data, echoing back to the days of Spanish rule and
the gold rush period.
And here, in llie center of il all, is Stanford I uiversilv.
