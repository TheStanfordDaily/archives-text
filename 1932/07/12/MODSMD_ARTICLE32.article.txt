rooms are e(|iiipped with Iwo doors, one lor usual service and
llie oilier, made of heavy oak, lor use only when stricl exclusion
is desired. When I lie outside oak door is shut, ii is understood
Ili;iI the room's occupant is to he left undisturbed.
A senior in an Kastern university, when asked shortly before

Too many limes we are so caught up in the whirl of studies,
athletics, and social events that we take no time for self-dis
covery and self-acquaintance. Hut how, in these goldfish howls
of universities, can we find a way to know ourselves? II looks
like this old Knglish custom is a good answer.
Our education will never be truly complete unless we caul
find some lime either figuratively or literally to "sport the oak"
and learn to know ourselves.
Il seems that everywhere you go now, automatic sprinklers
are irrigating not the grass, bill the. walks. We're wondering
just what queer plants are going to crop up from these concrete
walks eventliallv.
