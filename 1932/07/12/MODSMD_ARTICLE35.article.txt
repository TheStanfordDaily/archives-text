A HOUSE DIVIDED—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
In his motion picture career Walter
j Huston has personified the characteris
! tics of a leering Western bad man, a
j loud-mouthed Chicago racketeer, a
i grim prison warden, a tippling news
paper man, a smiling sheriff, and an
avaricious night court judge. And now
this "man of a thousand characters"
offers another versatile characteriza
tion. This time he's a two-fisted coast
fisherman.
| Frictjon arises when he sends for a
j mail-order bride and she falls in love
I with his son, a dreamer, but whom he
| thinks to be a weakling. Kent Douglass
! is the youth with ideals; Helen Chand-
I ler the girl. —R.W.S.

| THE FANTASTIC CITY-By A. R.
Neville. Houghton Mifflin, $5. (At
Stanford Bookstore.)
Alter reading "The Fantastic City,"
I a vivid and competent memorandum
lof San Francisco's light-hearted past,
j you are left thoroughly convinced that
truth is stranger than fiction. The work
j has been well titled. San Francisco's
j history was "fantastic."
Mrs. Neville, a young bride of a
! dashing Irish officer who came to the
j city in the '50'.s, gives us a sparkling
i well balanced account of the pioneer
i California in which • Senator Leland
j Stanford and Mrs. Stanford, founders
i of the University, played a conspicu
! ous part.
In this long book we find thousands
j of impressions of the city, the lesser
incidents in flashy memo style, and
j others recalled in all of their living
! and colorful detail.
| The author knew California when
| the gold rush was still in progress and
i miners bought watches by the pound.
I She enjoyed a wide acquaintance with
! the famous and the near-famous fig-
I ures of the half century. She knew the
I early Chinatown, with its gentlemen
J in lavender brocade, who drifted about
| streets scented with sandalwood and
listened to the shrill singing of slave
j girls.
From this book we can readily see
! where San Francisco won much of its
! charm. Written from the standpoint of
a woman, it dwells upon the cultural
features of California's history rather
! than the questionable and somewhat
sordid activities of the men of the gold
rushing days. This is a frank conver-
I sational memoir of a woman who knew
the city, and should be valued by fu
ture generations of readers and stu
dents. —R.W.S.

i well balanced account of the pioneer

In this long book we find thousands

From this book we can readily see

a woman, it dwells upon the cultural

the city, and should be valued by fu

dents. —R.W.S.
A HOUSE DIVIDED—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
In his motion picture career Walter
j Huston has personified the characteris
! tics of a leering Western bad man, a
j loud-mouthed Chicago racketeer, a
i grim prison warden, a tippling news
paper man, a smiling sheriff, and an
avaricious night court judge. And now
this "man of a thousand characters"
offers another versatile characteriza
tion. This time he's a two-fisted coast
fisherman.
| Frictjon arises when he sends for a
j mail-order bride and she falls in love
I with his son, a dreamer, but whom he
| thinks to be a weakling. Kent Douglass
! is the youth with ideals; Helen Chand-
I ler the girl. —R.W.S.
