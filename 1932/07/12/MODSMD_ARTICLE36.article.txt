# IF YOU ASK ME..

It seems that Roble had a dance . . .
And even though you paid ten cents
(you dirty liar).
The committee said it was a
jolly-up.
Yes, there was a jig in Roble Thurs
day. It was supposed to be an invita
tion affair.
So the whole campus went.
I forgot to take my Workout in the
afternoon, and the gym was closed at
night, so after I came over to Roble, I
stayed outside until the music began.
Didn't want to bother the introduction
committee too much.
Get the idea?
Some of the girls were, oh! awfully
lucky to rate dances with the prospec
tive members of the future Olympic
team. One ambitious young man who
was unfamiliar with the ways of a
jolly-up began to recite his life his
tory, and his rapid rise to dizzy heights.
The story followed in installments.
By the time (he dance was over
he was already 9 years old. %
Then there was the Hey-nonny
nonny-and-a-hot--cha-cha-blond with
the Southern exposure, who gave the
boys the run around. One big hand
some brute almost danced the length
of the floor. But the bliss didn't last,
long.
However, he still holds the rec
ord for the longest dance.
The dear, sweet young thing from
Kansas (or is it Great Falls?) with
the radiant smile and pleasant map, I
mean expression, thought the whole
affair quite cute â€”all the funny boys
standing around and looking so bored.
Didn't they know how <:o dance?
And why were the plants placed on
the floor? When informed that it was
for aesthetic purposes, she exclaimed
that .she took ether for her operation,
and not to remind her about it anyway.
And after all life is but a bowl of
mayonnaise.
It's slippery.
What's your name, dearie?
