# SPENCER FAVORS STANFORD STARS IN TRYOUTS HERE
## Eastman, Jones, Gray, Miller, And Laborde Should Win Places On The Squad 
### Jack Shidler 
Picking five Stanford men and one j
ox-Card to make the United States I
Olympic track and field team, "Bud" {
Spencer, former Indian hurdler and
quarter-miler and holdei' of the world's j
record in the 400-meter event, lists Ben
Eastman in the 400 or 800 meter race, '
Bill Miller in the pole vault. Nellie |
Gray in the shot, and Bob Jones and I
Here Laborde in ihe discus. He also!
favors Hec Dyer to place in the 200
meter class.
Interesting, only three Trojans are I
figure d in the running: Wykoff in the J
100, Graber in the pole, and Barber in 1
the broad jump. One Golden Bear— j
Bob Kiesel in the 200—is favored to '
qualify.
Eastman Has 800 Record
If Ben runs the 800 meters he will '
qualify, as he has Ihe best times of
any American middle-distance ace.!
More probable is his running the 400 |
alone, leaving to Lawson Robertson,
American coach, the decision as to
which race he will run for Uncle Sam.
The Olympic Committee took into
consideration the fact that Ben has
run 880 yards in 1:50.9 and 1:51.3 this
year, both performances being world's
record breakers, to say nothing of his
breaking the 800 meter record with a
lime of 1:50 and winning the IC4A 880 I
in 1:51.9, a time faster than any of
the country's other qualifiers.
Other MOO Meter Stars
Eddie Genung of Washington Uni- !
versify won the Long Beach trials and j
is the next logical 800 meter winner. I
His time was 1:53.3 and he finished ten !
yards ahead of the field. Charles Horn- j
hostel of Indiana University won the !
event at the N.C.A.A. semi-finals in !
1:52.7 with Dawson of Oklahoma and
Gray of Abiline Christian a shoulder i
behind in the order lusted.
Bullwinkle and Rosner of the New '
York Athletic Club can run the race I
in 1:53. Smith, Turner, Dawson, Letts,!
and Sansome will all be very much in |
the running. Letts was N.C.A.A. cham- I
pion in 1931.
Miller Favored in Vault
Bill Miller is a logical choice in the
pole vault because he has the best j
outdoor mark of the year, 13 feet 11' 4 |
inches. However, nineteen men have j
cleared 13 feet G inches and the finals i
may end up in a six-way tie or some I
other preposterous finish. The Olympic j
record is only 13 feet 9 :! s inches and |
when Brown, Seeley, Beecher, Graber, '
and Thompson lay their poles away
Saturday afternoon the worldN; record
of 14 feet l'i> inches probably will i
have been excelled.
The vaulters listed above have all
done 13 feet 10 inches in their qualify- ;
im; rounds to win or tie for first place, j
When these boys get together with j
the other thirteen qualifiers, much J
higher marks will undoubtedly result.
Lee Barnes, holder of the world's rec- j
ord, will compete, but it looks like a
Stanford-Yale sweep.
Gray Has Chance in Shot
Nellie Gray faces the toughest com- I
petition of the seven qualified Cardi
nals. Brix, Sexton, ;:nd Rhea have all j
put the shot farther than Gray this
season. Brix and Sexton have both I
hit 52 feet Br,a8 r, a inches and Rhea at the j
N.C.A.A. meet in Chicago tossed the \
ball 52 feet 5 :1 :» inches. Nellie did his !
best at the IC4A meet at Berkeley—
51 feet11 1 i inches. John Lyman, sen- !
sational Stanford sophomore, will '
probably find the going a little too
tough.
The Olympic record is 52 feet 11-1G j
inch and the world's record, 52 feet I
7'2 inches. Imagine how you would
feel if you broke the Olympic record
and failed to make your country's j
team, and you are in the position of 1
Sexton, Rhea, Brix, or Gray, for only |
three men are allowed in one event. |
These four are not alone, for Harlow
Rothert, former Stanford star, is mak- j
ing a comeback and, although he hasn't I
done, belter than 51 feet so far this j
season, 52 feet is an old story with i
him.
Two Cards May Be in Discus
Jones and Laborde are two of twelve {
discus-throwers who bettered 150 feet I
in the qualifying meets. John Ander- j
son has the best toss of the year at
H!3 feet 51-j inches. Jones' 101 feet 5 1-5 |
inches is next and Laborde's 159 third, j
It looks like these three men wil! j
represent America with Jessup and '
Jark as possible dark horses. Both
have thrown over 160 feet—Jessup j 1
holding the unofficial world's record of
109 feet 8"k inches. However, he is out
of form now and has only an outside I
chance of making the team.
Hector Dyer, star sprinter of Stan-I
ford's 1931 .track team, will find the !

going tough, but due to his showing at
T..<fng Beach of 10.4 in the 100 meters
and 21.7 in the 200, he is due to give
Metcalfe, Tolan, Toppino, Kiesel. and
Wykoff plenty of competition.
The task of picking the places in the
sprints next Saturday will call for
hairbreadth judgment. Three sprinters
who fail to place will be chosen for
the 400 meter relay team.

run 880 yards in 1:50.9 and 1:51.3 this

in 1:51.9, a time faster than any of
the country's other qualifiers.
Other MOO Meter Stars
Eddie Genung of Washington Uni- !
versify won the Long Beach trials and j
is the next logical 800 meter winner. I
His time was 1:53.3 and he finished ten !
yards ahead of the field. Charles Horn- j
hostel of Indiana University won the !
event at the N.C.A.A. semi-finals in !
1:52.7 with Dawson of Oklahoma and
Gray of Abiline Christian a shoulder i
behind in the order lusted.
Bullwinkle and Rosner of the New '
York Athletic Club can run the race I
in 1:53. Smith, Turner, Dawson, Letts,!
and Sansome will all be very much in |
the running. Letts was N.C.A.A. cham- I
pion in 1931.
Miller Favored in Vault
Bill Miller is a logical choice in the
pole vault because he has the best j
outdoor mark of the year, 13 feet 11' 4 |
inches. However, nineteen men have j
cleared 13 feet G inches and the finals i
may end up in a six-way tie or some I
other preposterous finish. The Olympic j
record is only 13 feet 9 :! s inches and |
when Brown, Seeley, Beecher, Graber, '
and Thompson lay their poles away
Saturday afternoon the worldN; record
of 14 feet l'i> inches probably will i
have been excelled.
The vaulters listed above have all
done 13 feet 10 inches in their qualify- ;
im; rounds to win or tie for first place, j
When these boys get together with j
the other thirteen qualifiers, much J
higher marks will undoubtedly result.
Lee Barnes, holder of the world's rec- j
ord, will compete, but it looks like a
Stanford-Yale sweep.
Gray Has Chance in Shot
Nellie Gray faces the toughest com- I
petition of the seven qualified Cardi
nals. Brix, Sexton, ;:nd Rhea have all j
put the shot farther than Gray this
season. Brix and Sexton have both I
hit 52 feet Br,a8 r, a inches and Rhea at the j
N.C.A.A. meet in Chicago tossed the \
ball 52 feet 5 :1 :» inches. Nellie did his !
best at the IC4A meet at Berkeley—
51 feet11 1 i inches. John Lyman, sen- !
sational Stanford sophomore, will '
probably find the going a little too
tough.
The Olympic record is 52 feet 11-1G j
inch and the world's record, 52 feet I
7'2 inches. Imagine how you would
feel if you broke the Olympic record
and failed to make your country's j
team, and you are in the position of 1

season, 52 feet is an old story with i
him.

It looks like these three men wil! j

Jark as possible dark horses. Both
have thrown over 160 feet—Jessup j 1

Metcalfe, Tolan, Toppino, Kiesel. and

behind in the order lusted.
Bullwinkle and Rosner of the New '
York Athletic Club can run the race I
in 1:53. Smith, Turner, Dawson, Letts,!
and Sansome will all be very much in |
the running. Letts was N.C.A.A. cham- I
pion in 1931.
Miller Favored in Vault
Bill Miller is a logical choice in the
pole vault because he has the best j
outdoor mark of the year, 13 feet 11' 4 |
inches. However, nineteen men have j
cleared 13 feet G inches and the finals i
may end up in a six-way tie or some I
other preposterous finish. The Olympic j
record is only 13 feet 9 :! s inches and |
when Brown, Seeley, Beecher, Graber, '
and Thompson lay their poles away
Saturday afternoon the worldN; record
of 14 feet l'i> inches probably will i
have been excelled.
The vaulters listed above have all
done 13 feet 10 inches in their qualify- ;
im; rounds to win or tie for first place, j
When these boys get together with j
the other thirteen qualifiers, much J
higher marks will undoubtedly result.
Lee Barnes, holder of the world's rec- j
ord, will compete, but it looks like a
Stanford-Yale sweep.
Gray Has Chance in Shot
Nellie Gray faces the toughest com- I
petition of the seven qualified Cardi
nals. Brix, Sexton, ;:nd Rhea have all j
put the shot farther than Gray this
season. Brix and Sexton have both I
hit 52 feet Br,a8 r, a inches and Rhea at the j
N.C.A.A. meet in Chicago tossed the \
ball 52 feet 5 :1 :» inches. Nellie did his !
best at the IC4A meet at Berkeley—
51 feet11 1 i inches. John Lyman, sen- !
sational Stanford sophomore, will '
probably find the going a little too
tough.
The Olympic record is 52 feet 11-1G j
inch and the world's record, 52 feet I
7'2 inches. Imagine how you would
feel if you broke the Olympic record
and failed to make your country's j
team, and you are in the position of 1
Sexton, Rhea, Brix, or Gray, for only |
three men are allowed in one event. |
These four are not alone, for Harlow
Rothert, former Stanford star, is mak- j
ing a comeback and, although he hasn't I
done, belter than 51 feet so far this j
season, 52 feet is an old story with i
him.
Two Cards May Be in Discus
Jones and Laborde are two of twelve {
discus-throwers who bettered 150 feet I
in the qualifying meets. John Ander- j
son has the best toss of the year at
H!3 feet 51-j inches. Jones' 101 feet 5 1-5 |
inches is next and Laborde's 159 third, j
It looks like these three men wil! j
represent America with Jessup and '
Jark as possible dark horses. Both
have thrown over 160 feet—Jessup j 1
holding the unofficial world's record of
109 feet 8"k inches. However, he is out
of form now and has only an outside I
chance of making the team.
Hector Dyer, star sprinter of Stan-I
ford's 1931 .track team, will find the !

going tough, but due to his showing at
T..<fng Beach of 10.4 in the 100 meters
and 21.7 in the 200, he is due to give
Metcalfe, Tolan, Toppino, Kiesel. and
Wykoff plenty of competition.
The task of picking the places in the
sprints next Saturday will call for
hairbreadth judgment. Three sprinters
who fail to place will be chosen for
the 400 meter relay team.

Spencer, former Indian hurdler and

Here Laborde in ihe discus. He also!
favors Hec Dyer to place in the 200
meter class.
Interesting, only three Trojans are I
figure d in the running: Wykoff in the J
100, Graber in the pole, and Barber in 1
the broad jump. One Golden Bear— j
Bob Kiesel in the 200—is favored to '
qualify.
Eastman Has 800 Record
If Ben runs the 800 meters he will '
qualify, as he has Ihe best times of
any American middle-distance ace.!
More probable is his running the 400 |
alone, leaving to Lawson Robertson,
American coach, the decision as to
which race he will run for Uncle Sam.
The Olympic Committee took into
consideration the fact that Ben has
run 880 yards in 1:50.9 and 1:51.3 this
year, both performances being world's
record breakers, to say nothing of his
breaking the 800 meter record with a
lime of 1:50 and winning the IC4A 880 I
in 1:51.9, a time faster than any of
the country's other qualifiers.
Other MOO Meter Stars
Eddie Genung of Washington Uni- !
versify won the Long Beach trials and j
is the next logical 800 meter winner. I
His time was 1:53.3 and he finished ten !
yards ahead of the field. Charles Horn- j

event at the N.C.A.A. semi-finals in !
