# U.C. CREW TO RACE AT LONG BEACH
## 
### 
University of California's eight-man
crew, rowing in the wake of its illus
trious Blue and Gold predecessors of
1928, will represent the United States
in the Olympic races at Long Beach.
The Golden Bears rowed their
Saturday to a spectacular victory over
the Penn A.C. crew on Lake Quinsiga
mond, Mass. They won by the scant
margin of two feet, and set a new rec
ord for the 2,000 meter course in doing
it.
In 1923 a Berkeley crew won the
Olympic championship at Antwerp.
Now, four years later, another Cali
fornia eight is favored to repeat, for
they will be rowing in native waters,
with no long trip or strange conditions
to affect them.
Another California entrant qualified
last week for the Olympic Games. Ed
gar Nemir, Bear wrestler, was picked
for the United States team in the 134-
pound class as a result of his showing
in the elimination tournament held in
Columbus, Ohio.
