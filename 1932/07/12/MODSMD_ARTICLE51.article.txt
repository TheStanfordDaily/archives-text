# PAGET-FREDERICKS SPEAKS TO GROUP IN ART GALLERY
## Artist Gives Impressions Of Famous People He Has Met In His Career 
### 
Speaking of the people wham he has
painted, Joseph Paget-Frederieks gave
an informal talk at the Stanford Art
Gallery Saturday morning. Paget-
Frederieks spoke at great length about
Anna Pavlowa, whom he has known
from childhood. In explaining Pav
lowa's success, he stressed the fact
that she was not only perfect in the
mechanics of the dance, but that she
seemed to become whatever element
she was interpreting.
The artist's picture of Pavlowa in the
Snow dance depicts this characteristic.
He quoted the impression which Pav
lowa made on several famous people,
among them Edna St. Vincent Millay,
who said, "She is a poet; with one
movement of her hand she expresses
what I, in a sonnet, would labor over
for months."
Several illustrations which will ap
pear in a Pavlowa memorial volume
being published by Paget-Frederieks
were explained. Commenting upon a
group which pictures the dancer in
various moods, he revealed several
characteristics of her temperament,
such as the fact that her friends were
able to tell the nature of her mood by
Ihe way in which she had dressed her
hair. Another painting shows Pavlowa
in one of her famous leaps. She was
able to jump completely across a stage,
and land on the points of her toes.
Paget-Frederieks had part of his
collcction of Pavlowa souvenirs on ex
hibit. Her costumes for "Gizelle," a
classic of the pre-war Russian ballet,
and the dance which made Pavlowa
famous while yet a girl; and for the
Swan dance were complete. Statuettes
of (he dancer, he explained, were done
by Pavlowa herself. Interesting to
those who saw the great dancer in
America was the statement that she
performed only the conventional bal
let dances in this country, and not the
more modern forms presented in Eu
rope.
Attracting a great deal of attention
were the portraits of the Baronne Des
landes and the Marchesa Casati. It was |
in the salon of Madame Deslandes that |
Oscar Wilde was introduced to Parisian
society. Describing a room where he
visited the madame, Paget-Frdericks
said that the floor was of glass, raised
above a stone foundation so that col- I
ored lights could be placed under it. ;
The walls were covered with mirrors \
to reflect this light.
The Marchesa was well known for
her hypnotic power. Paget-Frederieks
told of seeing her stare down animals :
of all kinds, making them tremble j
with fear. In his portrait of the Mar- !
chesa, he shows her with a black
panther, a favorite among the wild
beasts she kept near her.
After finishing his talk, Paget-Fred- j
cricks answered questions concerning j
special pictures. His exhibition closed !

hair. Another painting shows Pavlowa
in one of her famous leaps. She was
able to jump completely across a stage,
and land on the points of her toes.
Paget-Frederieks had part of his
collcction of Pavlowa souvenirs on ex
hibit. Her costumes for "Gizelle," a
classic of the pre-war Russian ballet,
and the dance which made Pavlowa
famous while yet a girl; and for the
Swan dance were complete. Statuettes
of (he dancer, he explained, were done
by Pavlowa herself. Interesting to
those who saw the great dancer in
America was the statement that she
performed only the conventional bal
let dances in this country, and not the
more modern forms presented in Eu
rope.
Attracting a great deal of attention
were the portraits of the Baronne Des
landes and the Marchesa Casati. It was |
in the salon of Madame Deslandes that |
Oscar Wilde was introduced to Parisian
society. Describing a room where he
visited the madame, Paget-Frdericks
said that the floor was of glass, raised
above a stone foundation so that col- I
ored lights could be placed under it. ;
The walls were covered with mirrors \
to reflect this light.
The Marchesa was well known for
her hypnotic power. Paget-Frederieks
told of seeing her stare down animals :
of all kinds, making them tremble j
with fear. In his portrait of the Mar- !
chesa, he shows her with a black
panther, a favorite among the wild
beasts she kept near her.
After finishing his talk, Paget-Fred- j
cricks answered questions concerning j
special pictures. His exhibition closed !
Sunday.
Speaking of the people wham he has
painted, Joseph Paget-Frederieks gave
an informal talk at the Stanford Art
Gallery Saturday morning. Paget-
Frederieks spoke at great length about
Anna Pavlowa, whom he has known
from childhood. In explaining Pav
lowa's success, he stressed the fact
that she was not only perfect in the
mechanics of the dance, but that she
seemed to become whatever element
she was interpreting.
The artist's picture of Pavlowa in the
Snow dance depicts this characteristic.
He quoted the impression which Pav
lowa made on several famous people,
among them Edna St. Vincent Millay,
who said, "She is a poet; with one
movement of her hand she expresses
what I, in a sonnet, would labor over
for months."
Several illustrations which will ap
pear in a Pavlowa memorial volume
being published by Paget-Frederieks
were explained. Commenting upon a
group which pictures the dancer in
various moods, he revealed several
characteristics of her temperament,
such as the fact that her friends were
able to tell the nature of her mood by
Ihe way in which she had dressed her
hair. Another painting shows Pavlowa
in one of her famous leaps. She was
