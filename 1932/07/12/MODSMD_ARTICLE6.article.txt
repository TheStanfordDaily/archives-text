# BOOK EXHIBITION IS OF INTEREST
## School of Education Sponsors Display Of Texts 
### 
Beginning July 11, yesterday, and
ending July 15, may be found an ex
hibition of textbooks and allied sub
jects in Room 300 in the Engineering
Building. Most of the leading pub
lishers are participating in this display,
which is sponsored by the School of
Education.
The exhibit includes all types of
texts, from complex technical subjects
to first readers for the kindergarten.
Several of the publishers have aLso
added maps and physiological charts
to their exhibitions. As a matter of
fact, the display shows some of the
outstanding publications in the educa
tional field of the past year, according
to David Lamson, sales manager for
the Stanford University Press.
The exhibits are arranged upon
tables, each publisher arranging upon
one table his books. On the Laidlaw
Brothers table there is an item of espe
cial interest: the Materials of the Bu
reau of Publications at the Teachers
College of Columbia University.

Another display of interest is that
of sponge and modeling clay. These are
used by the lower grades in the mod
eling of figures.
