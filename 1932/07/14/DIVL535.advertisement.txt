WINNERS NEED
RESERVE STRENGTH
Carefully guarded reserve strength will
play an important part upon the Stanford track

Reserve strength is also an important fac

posit your checking or savings funds. Ameri
can Trust Company is maintaining a statement
of financial condition which offers you the
security of high liquidity and strong reserves.
We invite you to visit our Palo Alto Branch

on June 30. There are also 93 other branches
in the metropolitan area of San Francisco Bay
which offer you complete and convenient
banking facilities. Let us help you to begin
building your own financial reserve strength
by regular deposits to a savings account.
