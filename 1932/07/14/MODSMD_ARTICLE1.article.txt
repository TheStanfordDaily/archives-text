# FIRST OLYMPICS CEREMONIAL OF GREEK RELIGION
## Champions Of Old Grecian Games Described By Dr. A. T. Murray Visiting Athletes Welcomed At University Assembly This Morning 
### 
Explaining the purpose of the origi
nal Olympic games, Dr. Augustus T.
Murray, professor of classical litera
ture, officially welcomed Olympic ath
letes to Stanford before a University
assembly this morning.
"The Greeks, being a highly reli
gious race, put athletics on such a
basis," Dr. Murray explained. "All
manual labor was done by slaves, and
there were no standing armies; conse
quently men directed their entire ener
gies toward physical development, in
order to be fit for military service."
Athletics Changed
Dr. Murray believes that the ideal
istic attitude toward athletics has
changed considerably since the Greek
era. "The old idea was a reverence for
physical perfection, which found ex
pression through competitive races and
games held periodically. The athlete
who ranked highest for each game
period was honored by having that
period named after him," he said.
"Greek thinkers criticized sport from
the standpoint o£ muscular develop
ment, because they were afraid that it
would lead to the loss of the aesthetic
ideal."
Continued 993 Years
The fact that the games continued
from 776 B.C. to 217 A.D. proved their
value. Rejected in the third century, it
was not until 1896 that their periodic
appearances were revived through
French interests.
"I believe that any dangers of the
contest would grow out of the spec
tacular idea of display," Dr. Murray
■said. "There is always a danger of
business entering athletics, and the ele
ment of contest is needed for the best
results. However, even that must be
safeguarded."
Dr. Murray was introduced by Rob
ert E. Swain, acting president of the
University.
