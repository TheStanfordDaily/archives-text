# DR. WILBUR PRAISES COLUMBIA BASIN AS POTENTIAL RESOURCE
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of
the Interior and President of Stanford,
describes the Columbia Basin project
as "the greatest undeveloped potential
resource in the Northwest," and pre
dicts its acceptance by the federal
government in the near future.
Speaking at a meeting in Spokane,
Wash., Dr. Wilbur said, "The basin
project is the ace in the Americarj
deck. I cannot say exactly when the
game will be played, but any setbacks
to it are merely temporary, and its
development is only a matter of time."
Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur will visit the
campus later in the summer, but the
exact date is not known as yet.
