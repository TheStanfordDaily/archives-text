! TWENTY-ONE EVENTS, 20 of which arc regular A.A.U. and 1S Olympic tests,
will comprise the dish to he served up to the track faithful when the final
try outs for the American Olympic team arc held in the Stanford Stadium
tomorrow and Saturday. While the best athletes in the United States are
battling for the right to wear Uncle Sam's Olympic Shield 011 their sweaters
they will also be settling the annual A.A.U. championships. Leading contenders
in this purely national meet are the defending champion L.A.A.C. stars, the

vNcw York A.C., and the Olympic Club
' of San Francisco.
: | In at least 11 of the 21 events there
j will be competitors who have bettered
1 the Olympic records in actual meets.
I Never before has the United States
j been able to assemble so many record
] breakers to fight for positions on the
' team.
Seven Cards Compete
Six Stanford men will compete in
j the Olympic finals and seven in the
I A.A.U. championships. Nelson Gray,
I John Lyman, and Here Laborde in the
I shot-put, Laborde and Bob Jones in
the discus, Ben Eastman in the 400-
i meter run, and Bill Miller in the pole
| vault make up the Indian contingent,
i Gus Meier will run for the Olympic
Club in the 220-yard low hurdles.
Along with these Stanford stars will
j be Bud Deacon in the pole-vault, Har
low Rothert in the shot-put, and Hoc
| Dyer in the sprints, all ex-Stanford
! track men now competing for the
j L.A.A.C.
Interest of Stanford fans will center
| on the 400-meter run in which Blazing
1 Ben Eastman will match strides with
j "Wee Willie" Carr of the University of
I Pennsylvania. Carr defeated Eastman
I in the 1.C.4-A. 440-yard dash to ad
! minister the first defeat of the year to
i Stanford's blond flash. With no 800-
j meter run to bother him, and only one
I trial on Friday to take any of his
energy, Eastman should be in fine form
to even his score with the diminutive
I speeder from the East.
Gray's Competition Stiff
Nellie Gray, premier Cardinal weight
j star, who has a mark of slightly
! than 52 feet, will have to do better
j than he has ever done in his life to
: rate a place on the U.S. team. He will
Ibe competing against Leo Sexton of
! the New York A.C. and Herman Brix
| of the L.A.A.C., who have both hit 52
| feet B':> inches, Hugh Rhea of Ne
* braska, who has done 52 feet 5%
| inches, and Harlow Rothert who .is
• rounding into the form that carried
! him over 52 feet when he was com
'peting for the Stanford Red.
In no less dangerous a position is
Bob Jones, Card discus ace, who will
j encounter John Anderson of the New
; York A.C., wilh a mark of 163 feet 5Vi
inches, his teammate Here Laborde,
who has done 159 feet in competition
land steadily over 160 feet in practic.fr,
Paul Jessup, who has a mark of 160
| feet S 7 /s inchcs up for recognition, but
who is badly out of form at the pres
ent time, and Bob Hall of the Univer
sity of Southern California, who is
capable of close to 160 feet if he is in
j condition.
Bill Miller, with perhaps the ex
-1 ccption of Yale's Wirt Thompson, has
; the best form of the six vaulters who
have cleared 13 feel 10 inches this year,
but with 19 competitors consistent of
13 feet 6 inches, any one of whom is
' likely to be "hot" Saturday, he will
have to do some super vaulting to lake
1 the title that coaches have conccdcrj
to be his.
