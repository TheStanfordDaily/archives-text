# WELCOME, OLYMPIC ATHLETES
## 
### 
Jm'oiii every section ol the I niled States you come, eager for
a place on the IIM2 American Olympic Team. Tall, lithe pole
vawlters; rangy sprinters; muscular discus throwers—tiit* cream
ol the amateur American athletes—and Stanford welcomes you.
We enjoy having you with us, and will endeavor to treat
you with the dignity you deserve, and that you would expect,
were you suddenly transplanted hack through the ages to an
ancient (ireek Olympiad. There you would have frequented
ii crude training table on the GW.M'oot gymnasium on the tiehl of
Klis for ten months prior to the games. When you tired you
would have flung yourselves down to rest upon a hard bed of
rushes, with no protection from the extreme cold or warmth
of the night. The contests would have been confined lo a small
athletic lield, with each man alloted only a small strip of
ground upon which to "develop" himself. At the (ireek Olym
piad you would, after a strenuous workout, dive into the River
Alpheus to cool off.
Hut here, as our guests, we hope you have used to advantage
the roomy stadium, the plunges at Encina Gymnasium, the
training table set up for you at the Commons, the comfortable,!
homey atmosphere of Brainier Hall.
America's chances for victory lie with you. You have the
wiry, muscular bodies; the keen, steady eyes; the energy and
fortitude; the determination lo win. And we wish you luck.
THE 'I*2 GHAI) FACES LIFE'S OLYMPICS
there is more behind this week-end's Olympic Trials than
mere intersectional rivalry, thrilling events, and a spectacular!
pageant. Before the thunderous applause of victory can greet
the panting contestant, he must undergo a grueling period of I
physical training and mental discipline.
J he Greeks, at the Held of Elis, swore on a bleeding sacrifice ;
that they had duly qualified themselves to enter the Olympics
by undergoing 10 months' continuous gymnasium training. And
the 1100 bronzed huskies who have invaded the campus to com
pete in the final trials also have gone through a period of
grueling training and self-denial.
But the agile athletes are not the only ones in training.!
Hundreds of American college students who graduated only
last month, and who are now looking desperately for jobs in j
this era of economic unrest . . . they too are undergoing a
period of "training," not for the Olympics of physical glory,
but for the Olympics of Life. Willi jobs scarce, wages slashed,
experienced men hunting jobs, the college graduate is apt to
become disillusioned, disgusted, discouraged. Scores have
visited Stanford during the past few weeks, smiling grimly, j
saying, "No, no job yet."
The Greek athlete trained diligently, subsisted entirely on
cheese, ripened figs, wheaten bread. The ".V2 grad, seeking!
work, is undergoing a mental "training" period. He feels, all
limes, that he doesn't fit, becomes moody, jaded. Everything j
seems hopeless. Yet he feels he must stick it out, last through
the preliminaries, struggle through the finals, and eventually'
enter, with a blaze of glory, Life's Olympics, a qualified con
testant willi a definite "position."
The wise Greek philosophers in discussing Olympic contests
maintained that probably no other institution exercised a
greater influence in molding the natural character, in produc
ing the unique type of physical and intellectual beauty which
is reflected in Greek art and literature. The unemployed '!52
grad is developing something, too, from his enforced "training" J
period. He will tell you that he's getting to know himself, his
icsources, his ability, the world he lives in, (he people with
whom he will some dav come into contact.
