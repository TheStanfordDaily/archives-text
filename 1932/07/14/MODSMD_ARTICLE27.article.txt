Unlontown, Pa., where George Washington fought the lirst battle of his ca
reer, more than (5,(100 American patriots from five states gathered for the
dedication ot: the shrine to Hie father of the nation by Pennsylvania. That
shrine is a log cabin, circled by a log stockade â€”an exact replica of Fort Neces
sity built by the young Washington and his meager band of soldiers in 1731
for protection against the French and Indians.
