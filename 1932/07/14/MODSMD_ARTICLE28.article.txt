BACHELOR'S AFFAIRS—At the Stan- t
ford Theatre.
Tonight the Stanford is host to the '
I Olympic athletes, and with Adolphe i
! Menjou as the suave bachelor, the j
j spYinters will appreciate his "fast" !
work. Humorous situations and clever J
| dialogue are liberally meted out when j
i Adolphe, as the well-to-do antique j
dealer homeward bound from Europe, '
is dazzled by childish Joan Marsh, who i
I is being steered into a comfortable
i marriage by her romantically soured j
I big sister.
Adolphe marries the hoydenish but !
moronic Joan, but she's too peppy fori
. him. She keeps him dancing until dawn
an dawakens him before noon for a 1
rhumba lesson. Then there's an at- 1
i tractive private secretary, and natur
ally you realize how it all works out. :
It's light and fast enough.to hold your j
attention, and the athletes need have
no fear of lapsing into a coma during
, the picture and wondering just what i
j they must do to attain that added
I something which will enable them ■
I either to sprint faster, hurdle quicker, I
: or put the shot further.

Hoover has been the target for mud- |
} slinging authors these past two years, i
I Cory, a reporter by profession, scores
j a scoop in "The Truth About Hoover." j
J In his unflavored style he has cor- j
I nered the President's adversaries and j
I discounted their pet stories, disarmed [
j them, and slapped their hands for mak- j
j ing such a muss.
Hoover emerges from page ten with;
| an unimpeachable character, and Cory j
, keeps the President well supplied with
| halos for every occasion.
Now and then the reporter pulls off 1
i his kid gloves to show how some real <
mud-tossing can be done. It's his book j
and Hoover's adversaries lose,
j Whether the average reader is in- '
! terested in what five authors have been i
| saying about his subject doesn't bother i
i Cory. He grinds out his assignment j
j with all the cool finesse of the edi- i
! torial room and he gives you the facts,
i One chapter treats of Hoover and his i
j presidential record with the difficult |
J problems he has had to face, and his j

i Probably the critics of the "New (
' Republic," or the "Lyrical Ballads," or
i "Tom Jones," felt a sense of impasse ;
i similar to that suffered by reviewers of j
j "Kamango." It is just one of those i
! things which defy definition. It is not
) exactly a novel, for there is no plot, j
] It is not quite an essay, for there are
!characters and descriptions; neither is,
lit a character sketch, for there are '
1 passages of pure concept, nor a philo- j
| sophy, for there is action now and then,
| and emotional interplay. There is great I
| subtlety of mood, and excellent depic
tion of physical sensations. In short, :
! Smith has created a new genre of mod- ,
| ern science.
i He has made a new type of book, '
| but probably it is not a type that can
be copied. The loose form he handles
so neatly and satisfyingly could very ,
easily degenerate into a rambling ex
-1 ample of nothing at all. So his creation ,
jis more of a single, unique, and very j
I pleasant exhibition, than it is a mile- ;
j stone in the development of any par
i ticular literary movement. But as an
j exposition of the thoughts that are in j
I the minds of many of us, and as an j

I this narration of Beales' travels from j
| Mexico to Guatemala, Salvador, Hon- '
I duras, and Nicaragua. At first you'll
S think that too much quinine quelled,

I kingdoms, augmented with snatches of i

j The value of "Banana Gold" is not

THE TRUTH ABOUT HOOVER—By
Herbert Cory. (Stanford Bookstore.)
i Houghton Mifflin. $2.50.
Hoover has been the target for mud- |
} slinging authors these past two years, i
I Cory, a reporter by profession, scores
j a scoop in "The Truth About Hoover." j
J In his unflavored style he has cor- j
I nered the President's adversaries and j
I discounted their pet stories, disarmed [
j them, and slapped their hands for mak- j
j ing such a muss.
Hoover emerges from page ten with;
| an unimpeachable character, and Cory j
, keeps the President well supplied with
| halos for every occasion.
Now and then the reporter pulls off 1
i his kid gloves to show how some real <
mud-tossing can be done. It's his book j
and Hoover's adversaries lose,
j Whether the average reader is in- '
! terested in what five authors have been i
| saying about his subject doesn't bother i
i Cory. He grinds out his assignment j
j with all the cool finesse of the edi- i
! torial room and he gives you the facts,
i One chapter treats of Hoover and his i
j presidential record with the difficult |
J problems he has had to face, and his j
I qualities of leadei'ship.
If you like debating you'll enjoy
j this. If you want a touch of the man
Hoover, or anyone else, you'll be dis
appointed. • —R.W.S. I

t KAMONGO—By Homer W. Smith.
The Viking Press. 1932.
i Probably the critics of the "New (
' Republic," or the "Lyrical Ballads," or
i "Tom Jones," felt a sense of impasse ;
i similar to that suffered by reviewers of j
j "Kamango." It is just one of those i
! things which defy definition. It is not
) exactly a novel, for there is no plot, j
] It is not quite an essay, for there are
!characters and descriptions; neither is,
lit a character sketch, for there are '
1 passages of pure concept, nor a philo- j
| sophy, for there is action now and then,
| and emotional interplay. There is great I
| subtlety of mood, and excellent depic
tion of physical sensations. In short, :
! Smith has created a new genre of mod- ,
| ern science.
i He has made a new type of book, '
| but probably it is not a type that can
be copied. The loose form he handles
so neatly and satisfyingly could very ,
easily degenerate into a rambling ex
-1 ample of nothing at all. So his creation ,
jis more of a single, unique, and very j
I pleasant exhibition, than it is a mile- ;
j stone in the development of any par
i ticular literary movement. But as an
j exposition of the thoughts that are in j
I the minds of many of us, and as an j
i example of the modern temper gener- j
! ally, the book "Kamongo" could not
! be finer. —J.B.

BANANA GOLD—By Carleton Beales.
J. B. Lippincott Co. 1932. $3. (At the !
Palo Alto Book Shop.)
| No aura of dare-devil adventuring, |
jno Halliburton romanticism shrouds \
I this narration of Beales' travels from j
| Mexico to Guatemala, Salvador, Hon- '
I duras, and Nicaragua. At first you'll
S think that too much quinine quelled,
| the author's fever for adventure, in i
; addition to quelling the qualms of
j jungle fever.
But he has sweated through sixteen
| of these South American summers. And
| what Stuart Chase did in "Mexico" so
, too does Beales, in a degree, attempt
i here. He inserts occasional excerpts ]
j concerning the economic and political!
j conditions of these banana and coffee
I kingdoms, augmented with snatches of i
| history and legend.
j The value of "Banana Gold" is not
ias a rugged tome of thrilling adven- 1
; ture, but as an enlightening expose of '
| swarthy politicians elected by revolu- J
! (ions, of graft with American loans, of
United States militarism in Nicaragua,
lof the Fort and the Cathedral—the j
nerve centers of South American life.
