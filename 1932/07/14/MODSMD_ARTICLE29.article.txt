Toyon Hall . . . subdued murmurs,
j punctuated with staccato bursts of j
laughter as the joke reaches an end
... the click of pool balls and the
I shuffle of feet going endlessly around
: the tables . . . lights over transoms
and the clack of typewriters . . . the
! rustle of turning papers from the ;
! lolling figures in the lounge room . . .
Toyon Hall.
Do you know that 9 out of 10 have
j a habit of drawing pictures on the
I margin of the notes on lectures. Look ;
! into your notebook und notice the ;
| various still-life objects, funny-looking I
J horses, and girls' faces that are in- â– 
, scribed thereon. 'Twill surprise you.

Here's another for your sense of ob- I
! servation. Notice that almost all girls I
carry their books cradled in their j
j arms. And notice that the fellows j
! either carry them tucked under their
| armpit, or swinging in their hand.

Talk about a screw-loose, here's J
one. There's a guy that lives out near ,
; the beach by San Francisco. He's got \
! a little shack in a clump of eucalyptus j
I trees that run down toward the ocean. |
In the morning he goes out and beats j
i a number of empty five-gallon oil cans )
| that have been strung about the place. :
As he beats, he will say to you, "That, j
| sir, is the future music of the world." j
A few days ago he cut down several '
1 of the trees on the ground that they J
interfered with the acoustics of his '
I "future music of the world."
