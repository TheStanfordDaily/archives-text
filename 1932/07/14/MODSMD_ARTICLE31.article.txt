# CHURCH ERECTED AS MEMORIAL TO LELAND STANFORD
## Mosaics Created By Venetian Firm And Installed By Italian Craftsmen 
### 
Considered by many to be (he most
beautiful college church in America,
the Stanford Memorial Church con
tains some of the finest mosaics in
existence. Created by Salviati & Co. of
Venice, Italy, they were shipped to
this country and installed by crafts
men who accompanied them here.
Made in nearly 26,000 variations of
color, the mosaic is possibly the most
accurate and lasting form of oil-paint
ing imitation. Contrary to the belief
(hat these are painted bits of stone,
the process is explained as (he baking
of enamel (o different shades of color.
All mosaics are made by an extreme
process of heating, with the exception
of the gold and silver ones. These are
obtained by the finishing of gold or
silver leaf between two layers of glass
under extreme heat, so that there is
no way of destroying (heir lus(re and
composition except by breaking them
into pieces. The baking process in
sures (he mosaic against losing its
color as long as the stone itself en
dures.

Above the altar in (he church hangs
a replica of Cosimo Roselli's "Last
Supper," (he only mosaic copy of the
famous painting in existence. Other
mosaics about the walls depict biblical
stories; while the windows portray
scenes from the life of Christ.
These stained glass windows, of the
modern American school, were created
by the most efficient process known,
that of blending diffei'ent thicknesses
of glass together to obtain variations of
a single color. The Easter window,
above the organ console in the rear
of the church, is considered by experts
to be one of the most technically per
fect examples of window staining in
America.
The bell tower of the church was 180
feet high before the 1906 earthquake,
and in its former site now stands (he
flat front of unbroken mosaic, said to
be one of the world's largest.
Mission Style of Architecture
Accentua(ed by tue mission s(yle of
archi(ec(ure, (he church has bo(h Ro
manesque de(ail and Byzan(ine lamps.
The ar( of mosaic making was original
ly Grecian, having its final perfection
achieved (hrough (he Italian school.
It is the custom of each graduating
class to place a metal and stone plaque
in the walk about the Inner Quad.
Commencing with the first class of
'92, the plaques lead from the church
entrance down the Quad. If annual
plaques are placed there un(il (he en

blocks are filled, it is estimated that 30
centuries will have passed.
The church was built by Mrs. Stan
ford in memory of Senator Stanford,
and was partially des(royed by earth

were removed to the Outer Quad
where they are still in use.

Considered by many to be (he most
beautiful college church in America,
the Stanford Memorial Church con
tains some of the finest mosaics in
existence. Created by Salviati & Co. of
Venice, Italy, they were shipped to
this country and installed by crafts
men who accompanied them here.
Made in nearly 26,000 variations of
color, the mosaic is possibly the most
accurate and lasting form of oil-paint
ing imitation. Contrary to the belief
(hat these are painted bits of stone,
the process is explained as (he baking
of enamel (o different shades of color.
All mosaics are made by an extreme
process of heating, with the exception
of the gold and silver ones. These are
obtained by the finishing of gold or
silver leaf between two layers of glass
under extreme heat, so that there is
no way of destroying (heir lus(re and
composition except by breaking them
into pieces. The baking process in
sures (he mosaic against losing its
color as long as the stone itself en
dures.

Above the altar in (he church hangs
a replica of Cosimo Roselli's "Last
Supper," (he only mosaic copy of the
famous painting in existence. Other
mosaics about the walls depict biblical
stories; while the windows portray
scenes from the life of Christ.
These stained glass windows, of the
modern American school, were created
by the most efficient process known,
that of blending diffei'ent thicknesses
of glass together to obtain variations of
a single color. The Easter window,
above the organ console in the rear
of the church, is considered by experts
to be one of the most technically per
fect examples of window staining in
America.
The bell tower of the church was 180
feet high before the 1906 earthquake,
and in its former site now stands (he
flat front of unbroken mosaic, said to
be one of the world's largest.

It is the custom of each graduating
