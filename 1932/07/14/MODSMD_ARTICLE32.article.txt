# RYAN RESEARCH LAB CONTAINS POWERFUL ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT
## 
### 
The Ryan Research Laboratory, said
to be the largest of its kind in the
world in regard to equipment and fa
cilities for high-voltage research, is the
gift of electric and power companies of
the country in tribute to the work of
Harris J. Ryan, professor emeritus of
electrical engineering.
The laboratory *is located about two
miles south of the Quad, and was es
tablished for the purpose of providing
graduate electrical engineers with the
means of solving various problems in
long distance power transmission.
The main building is a steel frame
structure standing 55 feet high up to
the roof-beams, with doors 50 feet
High and 40 feet wide. The purpose of
these huge doors is to connect the
transformers to the experimental power
lines on the outside. These doors may
be easily moved by one man.
The inside of the building is painted
black for the purpose of observing and
photographing the corona and other
phenomena which appear during the
high voltage tests. The motor genera
tors are located in a small room next
to the main laboratory.
Experiments in this laboratory have
been carried out with discharges up to
2,250,000 volts.
