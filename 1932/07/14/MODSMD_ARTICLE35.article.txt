# PROFESSOR MOORE HOLDS PAROLE NOT COMPLETE FAILURE
## 
### 
"A poor parole system is worse than
none," declared E. H. Moore, visiting
professor of sociology from Oregon
State College, when a reporter of the
Daily showed him the statement of
Chief Inspector E. J. Hogan of San
Francisco to the effect that the parole
should be abolished.
Professor Moore does not believe,
however, that one can condemn the
system as a whole any more than one
can praise the system as it is admin
lslered in most states. It is his opinion
that when prisoners are automatically
released because of good behavior
within prison walls, and when too few
or poorly trained parole supervisors
are in charge of the criminal's subse
quent actions, the system may be
justly condemned. In his opinion, this
does not mean that parole, in itself, is
c n unwise measure.
Parole Not Cure-All
'"Clearly no system of parole," he
went on to say, "is a cure-all. Because
John Doe makes satisfactory social and
economic adjustment under supervision
outside prison walls it does not prove
that parole will necessarily be safe or
successful with Richard Roe.

"There is reason to believe that some
system of parole can be successfully
adopted for one-fourth or more of those
committed to prison. Just as insurance
companies estimate the element of risk
in their patrons, so can the element of
success or failure be predicted for dif
ferent classes of criminals. The studies
of Burgess' record that the risk ranges
from 112I 1 2 per cent for carefully selected
groups to as high as 7G per cent for
other groups of offenders.
'"The tragedy of administration is that
with rare exception the data upon
which a guarded selection might take
place is so universally ignored in this
country."
