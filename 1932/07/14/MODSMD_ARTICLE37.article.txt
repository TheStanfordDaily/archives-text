# HISTORY OF "FARM" REVEALS EPISODES OF EARLY YEARS
## Mrs. Stanford, Jordan, And Faculty Responsible For World Eminence

When the world awoke one Novem
ber morning in 1885 to learn that a
new university had been born, a uni
versity with an endowment of $30,000,-
000, including 83,000 acres of land, it
could scarcely believe its sensesâ€”and
little wonder, for here was a gift
which, up to that time, was the largest
single gift ever made for one educa
tional institution. Such was the be
ginning of Stanford University.
The University was founded in 1885
by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
as a memorial to their son, Leland
Stanford, Jtf., and received its fifrst
class in 1891.
The tract of 8.940 acres, a part of
which the University now occupies,
was originally the Stanford farm and
Stanford is still known to as
"The Farm." Here Senator Stanford
owned one of the most widely known
stock farms in the world, and here
several of the most famous race horses
of the period were bred, among them
"Electioneer."
During its early existence Stanford
passed through several grave crises.
The sudden death of Senator Stanford
in the summer of 1893 left the Uni
versity in a perilous state, from which
it was saved largely through the loy
aky and unselfish efforts of Mrs. Stan
ford, President David Starr Jordan,
and the faculty.
Following a few years of steady de
velopment came the great earthquake
of 190(5 which resulted in damages to
University buildings of about $3,000,000.
This second emergency was bravely
met and a new Stanford quickly arose
from the ruins.
Stanford has slowly grown from a
small institution of 500 students to an
institution of world reputation with an
annual registration of approximately
4,500. This number would doubtless be
much larger but for the policy of
limiting attendance in the lower divi
sion and of women. Originally planned
as an institution which made no tui
tion charge, Stanford has been forced
by economic pressure to require a fee.
The original endowment, which was
more than ample for the needs of the
University at the time of its founding,
has ceased to be sufficient to take care
of the greatly increased student body
and the vastly multiplied needs of the
University.
One of the interesting features of
Stanford is the quarter system, which
divides the school year into four quar
ters, any three of which constitute an
academic year. This enables students
who wish to complete their college
education in the minimum time to
graduate in three years instead of four.
Architecturally, Stanford is unique
among the universities of America. It
is a modification of Spanish-Moorish
architecture, a particularly interesting
