# MONROE TELLS Of IRAQ ADVENTURES
## Faces Hardships Introducing Education There 
### 
The awakening of the Oriental and I
the revival of his culture will be listed j
among the outstanding events of the '
last century, according to Dr. Paul ,
Monroe, director of the International |
Institute of Teachers College at Colum- '
bia University, and president of Rob- !
erts College and Constantinople I
Woman's College in Istanbul, speaking ;
Monday evening in the auditorium.
Having recently returned from an
educational survey in Iraq, Dr. Monroe j
spoke on "The Educational Problem of
the Arabic World."
A transformation comparable to the I
Reformation in Europe is taking plact j
in the Arabic world, he maintains,
which involves the development of a '
new language, ideology* religion, and
other social institutions.
"Bringing a school imo this territory '
presents its difficulties," Dr. Monroe
continued. "There is no sanitation, so j
tribes must move in order to evade I
the disease which crops up suddenly
in a permanent camp.
In combating these conditions Dr. |
Monroe established normal schools
which travel with the tribe. Thus the â– 
people follow their old life while learn- '
ing the new.
