# COMPETITORS FOR HURDLES INCLUDE SALING AND BEARD
## California Entries in Jumps And Javelin Are Favored To Win Places 
### 
Twenty-eight hurdlers of national
renown will compete in the two Olym
pic barrier events, the 110 meter and
ihe 400 meter hurdles. The best of
this group is George Saling of lowa
who ran the 120-yard highs at the
N.C.A.A. meet in Chicago in 14.1 sec
onds.
A year ago Percy Beard of the
N.Y.A.C. ran a 14.2 flight of highs.
Beard is entered, and proved himself
dangerous by tying the world's record
to qualify for the American team linals.
Other timber-toppers who may make
the team are Wendell Smith of
L.A.A.C., Byron Grant of Utah, John
Morriss, Southwestern Louisiana A.C.,
and Eugene Record, of Harvard, who
won the 1.C.4-A. barrier race.
Jack Keller is the favorite in the
220 lows by virtue of his Lime of 22.7
seconds at the N.C.A.A. meet. Saling
and Harold Fates of Yale are expected
to furnish plenty of competition for
this event.
The best qualifying time in the 400
meter hurdles was turned in by Eu
gene Beatty of Michigan when he won
the N.C.A.A. semifinals at 52.9 seconds.
Joseph Healey, N.Y.A.C., Vic Burke,
Morgan Taylor, and H. M. Alcorn are
other fast men.
The high jump will see plenty of
action because Waller Marty of Fresno,
Bert Nelson of Butler, George Spitz
of N.Y.A.C., and Willis Ward of Michi
gan have all cleared 0 feet 7 inches
and are potential record-breakers.
Redd's 25 feet 6 inches looks to be
the best American effort to date in the
broad jump. John Brooks of Chicago,
and Dick Barber of U.S.C., have both
jumped over 25 feet this year. Redd's
mark of 48 feet 3'/i inches in the hop,
step, and jump event also is the best
to date.
So far in the javelin, James DcMers
of L.A.A.C., Ken Churchill of the
Olympic Club, and Malcolm Metcalfe
of Dartmouth have turned in the best
performances, and should place in \his
order.

the N.C.A.A. semifinals at 52.9 seconds.
Joseph Healey, N.Y.A.C., Vic Burke,
Morgan Taylor, and H. M. Alcorn are
other fast men.
The high jump will see plenty of
action because Waller Marty of Fresno,
Bert Nelson of Butler, George Spitz
of N.Y.A.C., and Willis Ward of Michi
gan have all cleared 0 feet 7 inches
and are potential record-breakers.
Redd's 25 feet 6 inches looks to be
the best American effort to date in the
broad jump. John Brooks of Chicago,
and Dick Barber of U.S.C., have both
jumped over 25 feet this year. Redd's
mark of 48 feet 3'/i inches in the hop,
step, and jump event also is the best
to date.
So far in the javelin, James DcMers
of L.A.A.C., Ken Churchill of the
Olympic Club, and Malcolm Metcalfe
of Dartmouth have turned in the best
performances, and should place in \his
order.
