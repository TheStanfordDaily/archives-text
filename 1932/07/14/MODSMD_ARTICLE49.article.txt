# STANFORD AERONAUTICS LABORATORY IS ENDOWED FROM GUGGENHEIM FUND
## 
### 
Stanford holds the distinction of
being one of the pioneer universities
in the field of aeronautical research.
In 191(5, with funds supplied by the
National Advisory Committee for Aero
nautics, a wind tunnel was built in
one of the buildings. Here work was
done on a propeller dynameter, with
experimental research on 51 model
airplane propellors. This was the first
i systematic investigation of its kind.
Guggenheim Gift Aids Work
Then, in 1926, the Daniel Guggen
heim Fund for the Promotion of Aero
; nautics, wishing to make further in
vestigations, endowed the University
with $15,000 for the alteration and
j adaptation of a building in the Median
-1 ical Engineering group. In addition to
the gift for the building, $30,000 was
! provided for the purchase of new and

more varied equipment, and $15,000 aj
year for a period of 10 years as an
annual operating budget.
Prior to 1927 Stanford offered only !
a tingle course in aeronautics besides j
the work in laboratory research. Now j
courses are being offered in aircraft i
structural design, theoretical aerody- J
namics, and aerodynamic design.
Director Touring Europe
Professor E. P. Lesley, director of the
laboratory, is on a six months' leave,
touring Europe and inspecting aero
nautic plants there.
Several men who have taken work >
in the laboratory have gone on in the !
aeronautical field, to commercial com- i
panies manufacturing planes, or to I
government service at Langley Field, I
Virginia.
