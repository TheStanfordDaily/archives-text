# HARRISON TELLS ATOMIC THEORIES
## Former Stanford Professor Shows Spectograph 
### 
The theory that the universe is grad
ually blowing up is tenable, George
R. Harrison, acting professor of physics
from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said in a lecture given in
the Little Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Professor Harrison offered photographs
of the spectra of different nebulae,
showing their difference to the audi
ence, as proof of his statement. "If this
theory is true, as it seems to be,"
declared Harrison, "the univei'se is not
as old as we think it is."
The use of the spectoscrope in de
termining the number of electrons and
the weight of the atom, was shown to
the assembled group. The technical
methods of "exciting" the atoms were
also shown to the audience.
Professor Harrison explained to the
group the methods of getting and tak
ing spectograph pictures, explaining
the use and importance of these in
determining facts about the different
atoms.
The various conceptions, held since
1890, of what an atom has been, and is
believed to look like, wei'e then
shown to the audience. These differed
greatly in detail, but were consistent
as to generalities.
