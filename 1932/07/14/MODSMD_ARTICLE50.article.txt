# ROW LIKES ITS COFFEE Summer Statistics Garnered EL TORO PREFERS MILK
## 
### 
Those students who purchase their
three square meals on Fraternity Row
drink approximately five gallons of
coffee per day. This figui'e is quite a
decline from the regular session quo
tations. About five gallons of milk ax*e
consumed daily by the eaters on the
"Row" and this comes closer to the
regular statistics.
Those in the Beta house go in more
for iced tea and milk as against coffee.
Cold meats, potato salad, and pies are
the favorites with the boys, especially
at the Chi Omega house.
The Chinese cook at the Chi-0
house, Tom Can, is used to cooking
for a house of girls. Much to his dis
may he has noticed that the boys eat
at least 50 per cent more food than the
same number of girls.
About 40 men are served at each
house every meal, although some of
them miss their breakfast. However,
these manage to make up in food at
luncheon and dinner. Cooks at all of
the houses notice no slack in the
amount of solid food eaten when com
pared with the regular session figures.
Down at the El Toro club 35 students
arc fed at each meal. Here milk and
chocolate are found to be the most
popular beverages. Pies and salads get
most play when placed upon the table.
Manager Parker Reed declares that
his gang eats about the same amount
as during the autumn, winter, and
spring quarters.
