A complete daily record of World
War Years.
Thousands of newspapers, magazines,
government publications, issued dur
ing the war.
Priceless originals—letters, diaries,
communications and reports, hidden in
musty vaults which, at the donors' re
quests, can not be read until the next
decade.
These factors make the Hoover War
Library, located in the left wing of the
Stanford Library, one of the greatest
centers for research on the World War
;ind reconstruction since the Armistice.
Belgian Collection Is Nucleus
Early in his associations with war
agencies Herbert Hoover realized the
value of a record of the entire conflict.
His collection of original documents
from the relief commission in Belgium
was the nucleus about which the li
brary was formed.
The prodigious task of collecting the
material was made possible by an en
dowment which sent a group of Stan
ford professors to Europe to accom
plish the work.
New Material Being Collected
