# ATHLETIC PLANTS OFFER STUDENTS VARIED PROGRAM
## "Sport For Every Individual" Is Motto Of Physical Education Staff 
### 
In striving to do away with the gen
eral practice of athletics for a chosen
few and bleacher seats lor the rest, Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, general director of
the school of hygiene and physical edu
cation, and H. W. Maloney, director of
minor and intramural sports, have
worked on the principle of "a sport for
every individual."
This has tended to keep men actively
interested in athletics after their re
quired two years of jjhysical education
are completed. The small enrollment
of undergraduate men at Stanford
shows a comparatively large number
of athletes, and this is made possible
by the extensive equipment available
for students.
Stadium Seats 00.000
The football stadium, after remodel
ing in ] 927, had a seating capacity of
88,000. This year $100,000 has been
spent and the stadium will now seat
over 00,000 spectators. II ranks second
in size on the Pacific Coast, the largest
being the Olympic stadium in Los An
geles. There is also an enclosed varsity
practice field, and fields for the frosh
and reserve teams, all of which are
well-turfed and kept in good condition
throughout the year.
There are two baseball fields, the
freshman and the sunken diamond. The
latter was built in 1930 at a cost of
$25,000 and is the finest of' its kind at
any university, in the opinion of such
an expert as "Bucky" Harris, Detroit
team coach.
Two Track Ovals
The "Big Meet" with California and
the USC-Stanford track duel are held
in the stadium, but the old oval is used
for practice and the smaller meets.
This track is fast: it was here that Ben
Eastman ran his quarter-mile in 40.4
seconds and his 880 in 1:51.3, both new
world's records.
Twenty-two tennis courts prove this
sport's popularity. Three courts are re
served for varsity use, eight more are
for the second and frosh teams, and
the other eleven are used by classes
and the student body. Tennis is a ma
jor sport and such stars as Helen Wills
Moody, Mis. L. A. Harper, and others
have appeared here in exhibition
matches. Phil Neer, Cranston Holman,
Ralph McElvenny, Johnny Doeg, and
Keith Gledhill are some of Stanford's
famous net men.
Encina Gym Rebuilt
The Encina gymnasium was rebuilt
in 1929. It is completely equipped for
every minor sport, including fencing,
boxing, wrestling, and gymnastic
rooms. The pavilion holds the large
basketball court which is used for in
tercollegiate games and varsity prac
tice, and smaller courts are in the gym.
The golf course was designed by Wil
liam P. Bell of Pa.sadena, who also
planned Bel Air, back of Beverly Hills,
and Castle wood, across the bay from
Stanford. Costing $250,000, this course
has gained the reputation of being one
of the sportiest on the coast. Perfect
greens and fairways surround the
clubhouse and pro-shop, which are
constructed in Spanish style architec
ture.
Three Men's Swim Pools
Three swimming pools are directly
outside (he gymnasium. These are a
recent addition costing $55,000. One is
a diving" tank, equipped with regula
tion boards and towers. A second is
used for varsity swimming and water
polo, and a third for general classwork.
There are bleacher accommodations for
500 spectators.
A turf soccer field is used by the
varsity and frosh teams. Soccer at
tracts students for league and inter
class play.
Of interest to athletic visitors should
be the trophy room in the Encina gym.
Photographs, cups, banners, and such
objects as the first block "S" are on
display here.
New Women's Gym
Facilities for women's athletics were
enlarged in 1931 by the building of the
new women's gymnasium. The old
Roble gym, called "Woodpecker Hall,"
had served as a "temporary" structure
since the founding of the University.
The new building, a gift of the Board
of Athletic Control, was erected at a
cost of $235,000.

Two Track Ovals
The "Big Meet" with California and
the USC-Stanford track duel are held
in the stadium, but the old oval is used
for practice and the smaller meets.
This track is fast: it was here that Ben
Eastman ran his quarter-mile in 40.4
seconds and his 880 in 1:51.3, both new
world's records.
Twenty-two tennis courts prove this
sport's popularity. Three courts are re
served for varsity use, eight more are
for the second and frosh teams, and
the other eleven are used by classes
and the student body. Tennis is a ma
jor sport and such stars as Helen Wills
Moody, Mis. L. A. Harper, and others
have appeared here in exhibition
matches. Phil Neer, Cranston Holman,
Ralph McElvenny, Johnny Doeg, and
Keith Gledhill are some of Stanford's
famous net men.
Encina Gym Rebuilt
The Encina gymnasium was rebuilt
in 1929. It is completely equipped for
every minor sport, including fencing,
boxing, wrestling, and gymnastic
rooms. The pavilion holds the large
basketball court which is used for in
tercollegiate games and varsity prac
tice, and smaller courts are in the gym.
The golf course was designed by Wil
liam P. Bell of Pa.sadena, who also
planned Bel Air, back of Beverly Hills,
and Castle wood, across the bay from
Stanford. Costing $250,000, this course
has gained the reputation of being one
of the sportiest on the coast. Perfect
greens and fairways surround the
clubhouse and pro-shop, which are
constructed in Spanish style architec
ture.
Three Men's Swim Pools
Three swimming pools are directly
outside (he gymnasium. These are a
recent addition costing $55,000. One is
a diving" tank, equipped with regula
tion boards and towers. A second is
used for varsity swimming and water
polo, and a third for general classwork.
There are bleacher accommodations for
500 spectators.
A turf soccer field is used by the
varsity and frosh teams. Soccer at
tracts students for league and inter
class play.
Of interest to athletic visitors should
be the trophy room in the Encina gym.
Photographs, cups, banners, and such
objects as the first block "S" are on
display here.
New Women's Gym
Facilities for women's athletics were
enlarged in 1931 by the building of the
new women's gymnasium. The old
Roble gym, called "Woodpecker Hall,"
had served as a "temporary" structure
since the founding of the University.
The new building, a gift of the Board
of Athletic Control, was erected at a
cost of $235,000.

In striving to do away with the gen
eral practice of athletics for a chosen
few and bleacher seats lor the rest, Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, general director of
the school of hygiene and physical edu
cation, and H. W. Maloney, director of
minor and intramural sports, have
worked on the principle of "a sport for
every individual."
This has tended to keep men actively
interested in athletics after their re
quired two years of jjhysical education
are completed. The small enrollment
of undergraduate men at Stanford
shows a comparatively large number
of athletes, and this is made possible
by the extensive equipment available
for students.
Stadium Seats 00.000
The football stadium, after remodel
ing in ] 927, had a seating capacity of
88,000. This year $100,000 has been
spent and the stadium will now seat
over 00,000 spectators. II ranks second
in size on the Pacific Coast, the largest
being the Olympic stadium in Los An
geles. There is also an enclosed varsity
practice field, and fields for the frosh
and reserve teams, all of which are
well-turfed and kept in good condition
throughout the year.
There are two baseball fields, the
freshman and the sunken diamond. The
latter was built in 1930 at a cost of
$25,000 and is the finest of' its kind at
any university, in the opinion of such
an expert as "Bucky" Harris, Detroit
