# HUNGARIAN TEAM TO SWIM IN CITY
## Stanford Men To Participate For Pacific Association 
### 
The Hungarian Olympic swimming
and water polo teams v/ill meet the
Pacific Association in an international
meet at Fleishhacker Pool on July 24.
The meet is a part of the celebration
for the Shriners, who will open their
annual convention in San Francisco
on that day.

The outstanding event will be the
100 meter free-style, in which Stephan
Barany of Hungary, sprint champion
of Europe and holder of the European
100 meter record, meets John Gardner,
captain-elect of the Stanford varsity
and holder of the Pacific Coast record.

Barany comes from the East
from a victory over George Kojac,
American sprint ace, but Gardner has
a way of pulling down phenomenal
times, and the race will be far from
a walkaway.
Gardner and Dick Hirsch of Stanford
will combine with Ralph Gilman and
George Friedlander of the Olympic
Club in an attempt to beat the Hun
garians in the 400 meter relay.
Bill Rogers of Stanford will repre
sent the Pacific Association in the 100
meter back-stroke event.
In water polo the Hungarians hold
the world's championship, winning the
title at Amsterdam in 1925. Against
them will be the Pacific Association
second team. The first team, with four
Stanford men, Ted Wiget. Austin Clapp,
Frank Booth, and Burke Knapp, on it,
will be competing that afternoon al
Pasadena, in the final tryouts for the
American Olympic team.
