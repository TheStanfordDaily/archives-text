# INDIAN PAINTINGS TO BE EXHIBITED
## Pueblo Scenes Replace Work Of Chiura Obata 
### 
An exhibition of paintings by the j
Pueblo Indians of the Southwest will j
replace the current exhibition of I
Chiura Obata's work in the Thomas j
j Welton Stanford Art Gallery, which j
I closed July 10.
| These Indian paintings are chiefly of 1
! dance scenes, dances being part of '
| their religious rites. Many of these are
I the same throughout the various
! pueblos with variations in costume and |
I steps and it is forbidden for a white
j man to see any but a few of them. In ;
I fact, the native artists who have vio
j lated tribal tradition by recording the
! costumes and steps have been debarred
jof certain tribal privileges and de
] prived of the right to use their family
! names.
Strangely enough European collec
i tors are more interested in the work of
j these Indians than Americans. They
I have been buying their paintings for !
: many years. Since the Indian Tribal
j Arts Exhibition was held recently in
j New York, there has been an increase
lin interest. Mrs. John. D. Rockefeller j
and Mrs. Herbert Hoover are both
j owners of paintings by members of
j these same Indian tribes.
Ad in Daily Princetonian.—"Go by
Bus!" They usually do.
