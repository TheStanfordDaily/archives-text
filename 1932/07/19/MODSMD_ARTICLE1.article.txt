# CORNISH TROUPE TO GIVE FRENCH COMEDY TONIGHT
## Present "Love And Chance," 18th Century Play, In Assembly Hall Players Consist Of Graduates From Drama School Of Seattle, Wash. 
### 
"Love and Chance," an 18th century
comedy by Marivaux, will be presented
by the Cornish Players Touring Group
at 8 o'clock this evening in the As
sembly Hall. The play.is open to the
public without charge.
The play concerns two young lovers.
Sylvia, a lady of quality, who, about
to meet her fiance, hitherto unknown
to her, disguises herself as her own
maid. Strangely enough. Dorante, her
suitor, has the same idea; and the
audience is treated to some entertain
ing situations and complications when
pseudo maid and valet fall in love with
each other. After Dorante has revealed
his identity to Sylvia, she does not tell
him who she is until she has led him
on to a declaration of love.
Play Within a Play
The comedy carries out the old idea
of a play within a play in a novel way.
Sylvia's father and her brother are
aware of the farce being enacted, and
enjoy it from the forestage, watching
the disguised players enacting the
story on a smaller stage within a large
gilt frame.
The Cornish Players Group is com
posed of graduate students of the De
partment of Theatre, Cornish School,
Seattle, Washington. The Cornish Little
Theatre was founded in 1917 by Ellen
Van Volkenbui-g and Maurice Browne.
It has produced innumerable plays and
has graduated a number of players
who have become pronounced suc
cesses in New York, London, and other
theatrical centers.
Frenchman Is Director
Jean Mercier, late of Viex Colombier
Theatre, Paris, and a member of that
notable group "Les Quinze," who came
from Europe to direct the Cornish
Players, succeeds in retaining the
French atmosphere of play, and in
bringing out all the subtle wit that
Marivaux intended.
A refreshing change from the sophis
ticated comedy of today, it is produced
in authentic detailâ€”sets, costumes,
properties, presenting a picture that
might have come from the brush of
Watteau or Fragonard. The atmosphere
of the period, 1730, is reproduced; the
stilted walks, the elaborate' courtesies,
the fan-waving, the monocle toying.
The cast includes Grace Vivian
Davis, Lorraine Keeton, Ford Rainey,
Edgar Johnson, Arthur DeHuff, and
Vernon Worthingham.
