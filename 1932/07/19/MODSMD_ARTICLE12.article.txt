# SMALL AUDIENCE PRESENT TO SEE 'PARADE' STAGED
## Stover's Sets, Performances Of Myna Hughes, Mahu Are Features 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Two fine sets with the touch of
Frederick Stover, admirable perform
ances by Myna Hughes and William
Mahu, a small audience giving gener
ous applause in exit, and the "Parade"
was over.
Those are the highlights which will,
be retained a week hence in the mind
of the spectator who witnessed Direc
tor Stover's production of Elaine
Ryan Wallace's "Parade" in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall Friday evening.
Handicapped from the first by an
insufficient number of competent ac
tors, Director Stover undoubtedly I
turned out the best play which might j
have been expected. Beyond the di- I
rector's control was the third act of i
the comedy, which suddenly turned j
melodramatic, requiring nothing short ;
of a Broadway cast for convincing and
plausible interpretation. Blame the J
playwright and the depression, with its
subsequent small summer quarter
registration, then, for whatever "Par
ade" may have lacked.
"Sharkey" Scores Hit
As written, the play concerns the
affairs of "Rock" Hennessey, an Olym
pic sprint champion, and in particular
his entanglement with Irene, an ambi
tious telephone operator. As produced, j
interest centered rather about "Shar
key," wise-cracking companion of the ;
champ, and "Minnie," a veteran of the '
switchboard.
Marian Littlefield, as Irene, was;
good-looking and sincere; Terrence ;
Geddis was big, good-natured, and
dumbâ€”the genuine Hennessey; but
both lost their scenes, Miss Littlefield
to Miss Hughes at the other switch
board, and Geddis to Mahu, the gen
tleman sprawled on the other daven
port in their hotel suite. Mahu, al
though perhaps a little juvenile for the
part in which he was cast, dominated
his every scene by sheer confidence
and stage presence.
Minor Farts Well Flayed
Minor parts were played, at times
pleasingly, at times spottily, by Enid
Clivi, John Shidler, Joe Wolf, Walter
Newcomb, Beulah Dimmitt, Robert
Myers, Sheridan Hegland, William
Guinn, Ben Kagan, Robert Brauns,
George Leavens, James Sandoe, R. R.
Evans, Waldo Salt, and Dorothy Willis.
As aforementioned, Stovers sets
were artistic and, at the same time,
sufficiently realistic. A modernistic
mural from the brush of Cary Odell
decorated the lobby set, the stairs of
which, by the way, adequately with
stood the entrances and exists of a j
pair of bounding bell-hops.
