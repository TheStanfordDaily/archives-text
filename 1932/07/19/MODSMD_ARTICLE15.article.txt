# New Spanish Government Is Predicted By Espinosa
## 
### 
In the opinion of Dr. Aurelio M. Es- ]
I pinosa, Jr., who will lecture at 4:15
i o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the
1 Little Theatre, there will soon be an
j other change of government in Spain,
j "When the last election was held, the |
conservatives did not vote."' Dr. Es
j pinosa explained. "Therefore, in the
coming election things will be differ
jent, because most of the conservatives
i feel that the present system is not the
I right one and want to change it."
Socialism Prominent
Dr. Espinosa pointed out the effect
I of the prime minister's rule, and sug
; gested that aspects of socialism are
j prominent in both educational and gov
ernmental systems. He believes that
the present misunderstanding has
sprung from unpreparedness and the
fact that the nation has been practi

[cally ruled by college professors who
are better fitted intellectually than po
litically.
"The whole new Spanish republic is
the result of an intellectual revolution," t
j Dr. Espinosa stated. "It culmihates the |
j development of a movement in prog- \
gress for the last HO years, and the 1
change isn't over yet."
