# Downes Speaks About Music Of Modern Russia
## Noted New York Times Critic Gives First Lecture 
### 
How much structure and how little
emotion there really is to music was
revealed Monday afternoon by Olin
Downes, music critic of the New York
Times, in his "Musical Impressions of
the Caucasus," the opening lecture of
a series of 12 to be presented at the
•Little Theatre.
"Folk art is the element of all Rus
sian music, most particularly of the
| Caucasian type, and if music continues
| without fertility, it becomes sterile and
j loses meaning and beauty," the speaker
j declared. "Therefore, folk-music is
most essentially from the soil, because
it has been one of the most inborn
parts of Caucasian life."
Downes, who has just returned from
an extensive tour of Europe, empha
sized the universally-known fact that
music creates kinship. He pointed out
that wherever he went communities
practically made music their daily life.
| "There is something so mysteriously
! perfect in music as to present a wholly
j unconventional range of harmony
j through the Russian interpretation,"
[ Downes said. "I was struck with the
! likeness of these songs to the eai'ly
! Gregorian chants of the first Christiai?
; era."
In Russia today, he pointed out,
there is a school of Georgian composers
who show great promise of bringing
forth a new scope and school of music.
"The past, after all, is really the
present," Downes said. "And we need
I to know the primitive history to be at
all impressed by the genuineness of it.
When Russian folksongs are docu
mented and developed, and when we,
as well as. the Russians, learn to under
stand the past in relation to the pres
ent, then music will become a univer-
I sal creed."
