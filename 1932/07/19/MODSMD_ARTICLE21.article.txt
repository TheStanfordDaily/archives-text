### Jack Shidler 
The eircus is over. Empty pop bot
! ties, peanut shells, derelict athletes,
i and sunburned faces remain as mute
I evidences of the Roman Holiday. The
' three-ring performance of the coun
j try's best athletic entertainment jour
-1 neys southward to the Olympics.
Hearts ached for the game Beatty,
: bodies strained as Miller and Graber
I attained new heights, and the masses
j cheered hoarsely as "stout fella" Carr,
the poker-faced 400-meter star, led
Eastman to the tape.
Stanford representatives on the 1932
: Olympic team will include Ben East-
I man in the 400-iijeter dash, Bill Miller
' in the pole-vault, Here Laborde in the
discus, and Nellie Gray in the shot.
Significant as a tribute to Stanford
coaches and as a nucleus for the '33
varsity ,is the fact that Ihese men will
be competing for Stanford next year.
Miller Champ a Moment
Bill Miller nad one of the toughest
breaks in the meet when his world's
record was tied and then broken within
half an hour after his record-breaking
vault. Ben Eastman was taken handily
and positively, although the time was
not equal to Ben's best. Northern Cali
fornians still expect him to startle
Olympic fans in the Los Angeles sta
dium.
Bobby Jones' defeat in the discus
was perhaps the biggest upset of the
meet. His excellent form and seasonal
consistency failed in a critical period
and he failed to qualify, his best mark
being 151V2 feet, giving him sixth place.
After throwing poorly on Friday and
failing to qualify, he was given another
chance on Saturday, but he couldn't
get off a winning throw. This is Bob's
last collegiate year of competition. Here
Laborde came through with a toss of
158.02, just qualifying him for the third
man on Uncle Sam's team.
Dyer Named on Relay
Hec Dyer has *been named for the
400-meter relay team and Hec deserves
to make the team for, during the last
year he has kept in the running in
spite of not being in school, a feat not
accomplished by many sprinters. Bud
Deacon made a desperate bid for third
man in the pole but he lived up to his
cognomen of "hard-luck Bud" and
when the tie for third place was
vaulted off, couldn't make the 13 feet
10 inches which he so cleanly vaulted
I earlier in the afternoon.
Harlow Rothert, another former
! Stanford star, took third place in the
shot put to give the Cards another rep
resentative in the Olympics. His team
mate from L.A.A.C.—Herman Brix —
was nosed out of fourth place by John
Lyman, sophomore weightman.
To the hoary annals of time will
proudly be added the athletic achieve
ments of William Carr, William Graber,
Pen Hallowell, Joe McCluskey, Frank
Connor, Ralph Metcalfe, Robert Van
Osdel, Ed Genung, Ken Churchill, and
Ralph Hill.
Many Stars Upset
In a meet so sparkling with accord
breaking times, heights and distances,
! there is a tendency for the hard-boiled
track fan to forget too easily the
tragedy of the losers. Beatty, Rhea,
DeMers, Jones, Brocksmith, Ward,
Venzke, and Marty are all men whose
marks of recent date prove them bet
ter than many of the United States
i team in their events. But no kick is
expected nor will it come from these
■ men as they are passed up in the 1932
I Olympiad.

cognomen of "hard-luck Bud" and
when the tie for third place was
vaulted off, couldn't make the 13 feet
10 inches which he so cleanly vaulted
I earlier in the afternoon.
Harlow Rothert, another former
! Stanford star, took third place in the
shot put to give the Cards another rep
resentative in the Olympics. His team
mate from L.A.A.C.—Herman Brix —
was nosed out of fourth place by John
Lyman, sophomore weightman.
To the hoary annals of time will
proudly be added the athletic achieve
ments of William Carr, William Graber,
Pen Hallowell, Joe McCluskey, Frank
Connor, Ralph Metcalfe, Robert Van
Osdel, Ed Genung, Ken Churchill, and
Ralph Hill.
Many Stars Upset
In a meet so sparkling with accord
breaking times, heights and distances,
! there is a tendency for the hard-boiled
track fan to forget too easily the
tragedy of the losers. Beatty, Rhea,
DeMers, Jones, Brocksmith, Ward,
Venzke, and Marty are all men whose
marks of recent date prove them bet
ter than many of the United States
i team in their events. But no kick is
expected nor will it come from these
■ men as they are passed up in the 1932
I Olympiad.

Turkish newspapers are forbidden by
law to publish suicide news.
The eircus is over. Empty pop bot
! ties, peanut shells, derelict athletes,
i and sunburned faces remain as mute
I evidences of the Roman Holiday. The
' three-ring performance of the coun
j try's best athletic entertainment jour
-1 neys southward to the Olympics.
Hearts ached for the game Beatty,
: bodies strained as Miller and Graber
I attained new heights, and the masses
j cheered hoarsely as "stout fella" Carr,
the poker-faced 400-meter star, led
Eastman to the tape.
Stanford representatives on the 1932
: Olympic team will include Ben East-
I man in the 400-iijeter dash, Bill Miller
' in the pole-vault, Here Laborde in the
discus, and Nellie Gray in the shot.
Significant as a tribute to Stanford
coaches and as a nucleus for the '33
varsity ,is the fact that Ihese men will
be competing for Stanford next year.
Miller Champ a Moment
Bill Miller nad one of the toughest
breaks in the meet when his world's
record was tied and then broken within
half an hour after his record-breaking
vault. Ben Eastman was taken handily
and positively, although the time was
not equal to Ben's best. Northern Cali
fornians still expect him to startle
Olympic fans in the Los Angeles sta
dium.
Bobby Jones' defeat in the discus
was perhaps the biggest upset of the
meet. His excellent form and seasonal
consistency failed in a critical period
and he failed to qualify, his best mark
being 151V2 feet, giving him sixth place.
After throwing poorly on Friday and
failing to qualify, he was given another
chance on Saturday, but he couldn't
get off a winning throw. This is Bob's
last collegiate year of competition. Here
Laborde came through with a toss of
158.02, just qualifying him for the third
man on Uncle Sam's team.
Dyer Named on Relay
Hec Dyer has *been named for the
400-meter relay team and Hec deserves
to make the team for, during the last
year he has kept in the running in
spite of not being in school, a feat not
accomplished by many sprinters. Bud
Deacon made a desperate bid for third
man in the pole but he lived up to his
cognomen of "hard-luck Bud" and
when the tie for third place was
vaulted off, couldn't make the 13 feet
10 inches which he so cleanly vaulted
