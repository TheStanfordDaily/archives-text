# AFTER THE BATTLE MOTHER
## 
### 
Another layer of dust has settled on the drooping leaves of
low-hanging euecalytpus hows, the nation's greatest ttthleles
have come and gone, the greatest track and licld classic which
the West will witness for decades is over.
It's over, and approximately two years from now we'll read
about il in the ollicial record hooks, if they appear on schedule,
and some of us will say, "I saw (iraber make thai vault. What a
vault, oh hoy!" And others will say, "(lawd, hut il was hot in the
Stadium that day." Nearly all of us paid our admission, and
nearly all of us got our money's worth.
II was a great meet no doubt of that. Men ran faster, and
jumped higher, and threw things further than any men before
I hem. Some of I lie favorites lost, and some of the dark horses
won.
And speaking of dark horses, Ihe Olympic committee ought
to hang one of its choicest medals on the Lincoln monument.
The greatest loser of a]l, we thought, was Bill Miller. Not Hen
Kastman, or Hobby Jones, or (lene Vcnzke but Hill Miller. His
was the sad experience of being the first to break the world's
record.in the pole vault. Photographers Hocked to the vaulting
pit from all corners of the Stadium. They shot pictures of the
Stanford athlete, pictures which did not appear in the Sunday
papers for a few minutes later Hill (iraber of Southern Cali
fornia soared higher still.
Heing a world's champion means a lot to a track and field
athlete, but being a world's champion for a few minutes must
be terrible. Miller's championship was snatched from him before
he had so much as one opportunity to stroll into the Mark Hop
kins dining room under the admiring observance of sport fans
(here assembled.
And so the meet is over, and the United Stales will have a
strong team in the Olympic track and field events, and the
United States will win the Olympics, which everyone has known
nil along.
