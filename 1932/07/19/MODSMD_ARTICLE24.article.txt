# THE
						EAST TRUMPS OUR ACES

The East wind doth blow,
And we shall have snow,
And what will the West do then, poor thing?
We'll sit in a barn,
To keep ourselves warm,
And hide our heads under our wings, poor things!
Apologies to Mother (loose
The United States Olympic Team trials have left us rather
groggy. Our beautiful bubble of Western supermaev, which had
grown even bigger after the 1.C.4-A. Ineet where U.S.C. and
Stanford look first and second team honors and California was
right up in the money, has been rudely pricked. It is beginning
to dawn upon us that the East and Middlewest, in spile of the
fact that they lack our much-vaunted climate, can turn out
athletes who can literally run our best into the ground.
One has only to gather the facts about the Olympic meet.
Only four Western stars qualified in running track events!
Genung of Washington won the 800, meters race, Hill of the
Olympic Club won the 5,000 meters, and Eastman of Stanford
and Cordon of L.A.A.C. look second and third in the 400-meter
dash. WvkofF, Kiescl, Dyer, Stokes, Payne, Smith, George, Car
ter, Dobbs, Sansome, Blanchard, Pomeroy, Ablowich, Wocssner,
and Halahoya arc Ihe "best in the West" and so, in our logical
sequence, Ihe "best in the country." Rut where were they last
week? Trailing the flying feet of the Eastern runners.
In I lie field, we did a little better. Graber, Miller, Gray,
Laborde, Rotliert, Jefferson, Churchill, Rarbcr, Van Osdel, John
son, .lessup, and Casey won United States uniforms. Rut Rarbcr,
Casey, and Churchill got into the finals only because of a change
in qualifying rules, and Casey was later ruled off Ihe team.
Such champions as Rrix. DeMers, Moellcr, Walker, Marty, Las
sallette, Stewart, Shelby, Jones, Kelley, Rarncs, Sturdy, and Pool
fell by the wayside.
Twelve out of twenty-four in the field, and four out of thirlv
on the track!! Even the added fact that WvkofV, Dyer, Kiesel,
and Ablowich have been chosen for relay teams does not boost
our already too-low average very much.
What a dav for the Golden West!
