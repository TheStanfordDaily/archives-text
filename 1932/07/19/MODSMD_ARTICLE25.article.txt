# PRESIDENT HOOVER CUTS HIS PAY
## 
### 
There are some people to whom President Iloover's volun
tary return of 20 per eenl of his salary is a mere political 1
gesture, made in an effort to win appreciative votes.
These critics overlook the fact that even the President's best
friends have never called him an able politician. Were he seek
ing to make political overtures, he would ollicihlly open the'
Olympic (lames in Los Angeles, instead of slaving on the job in
Washington where important tasks need his uninterrupted ;il
tention.
President Hoover has not bothered about vote-winning j
moves. His voluntary reduction in salary was prompeted bv a
sincere desire to aid the national economy program. It should
be accepted as such by the American people.
During the regular school year, frequent use is made of the
"(lampus Opinion" department. Heated debates, pertinent sug
gestions, and rabid doctrines have all found their way into the
columns of the Daily. The only requirements are that opinions
be signed and brief. Summer quarter students are welcome to
our paper.
