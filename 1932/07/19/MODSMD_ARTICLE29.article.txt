GRAND HOTEL — At (he Varsity
Theatre.
People mill about in the lobby, a
toil-worn bookkeeper who has never
"lived"' tastes life lor the first time, a
ballet dancer falls in love, a man is
murdered, and a baby is born. People
come and go, yet "nothing ever hap
pens" says battle-scarred Dr. Ottern
schlag.
"Grand Hotel" is one of those rare
pictures which makes everyone say,
"Oh you simply MUST see it." Adapted
from Vicki Baum's sensational play, the
film version now combines the out
standing performances of five stars
with the wide range the camera can
cover.
It is unique in plot, in acting, in
characterization, photography, and in
its philosophy. Director Edmund
Goulding, faced with the problem of
handling five temperamental geniuses,
did his work well. There is a distinct
blending of personalities, yet each
character retains his own vivid indi
viduality.
Garbo is Grusinkaya, the blase dan
seuse whose fame is rapidly slipping
. . . . tired, restless. Then debonaire
John Barrymore slips into her life for
a few hours of ecstacy, as the irre
sponsible baron, and she finds life
worth living. But two hours later he
is dead.
And there is Krengelein (Lionel Bar
rymore), the little pencil pusher, with
only a few weeks to live, who spends
his life savings in one mad splurge.
There is the scheming Preysing, bru
tal industrial magnate, as portrayed by
Wallace Beery. And then there is Joan

Crawford as Flaemmchen, the gay little
stenographer, who wants men to he
nice to her.
Pathos, human interest, humor, thi*
unexpected .... all are present in
"Grand Hotel" just us they are in
present life. The revolving doors go
around and around. New guests ar
rive, old ones depart, and Kringlein
mutters, "There are Grand Hotels
everywhere." —E.L.

RED I1I<:AI>K1> WOMAN—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Jean Harlow, whom we once thought
of jus the original platinum blonde of
Hollywood, comes into her own as the
scorching red-headed home-wrecker of
the old home town—and what a
woman! This role, claimed to be one
of the mpst coveted parts of the year,
was apparently created with Miss Har
low in mind; as the discontented, am
bitious stenographer from over the
railroad tracks, she rapidly makes her
way into the home and heart of her
boss (Chester Morris) and proceeds to
get the poor man into a nice scrape on
a certain night when the wife returns
unexpectedly.
If you like Jean Harlow, and if you
want to see plenty of her, you won't
be disappointed in this M.G.M. riot.
Also in the cast are Lewis Stone, Leila
Hyams, and Una Merkel, topping the
picture with their usual good per
formances. Famous last words, "Well,
he's a man, ain't he?" —J.R.B.

Macaroni is made in more than 100
different shapes.
