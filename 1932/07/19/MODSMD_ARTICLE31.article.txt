The drawings for the summer tennis
singles tournament have been posted
on the bulletin board in Encina Gym
nasium, and Elwyn Bugge, director of
tennis, says that the players should
begin playing off their matches imme
diately. "The partners should make it
their responsibility to get in touch with
each other and play their matches,"
says Bugge.
The rules are that the loser in each
match is to pay for the tennis balls
used in the game. Regulation tennis
dress, including soft-soled shoes, is re
quired.
