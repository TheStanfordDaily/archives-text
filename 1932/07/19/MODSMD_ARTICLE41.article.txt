Wow in Olympic diving events when
the A.A.U. barred "Pete" Desjurdines,
Stanford's world champion, from ama
teur standing. Desjardines was Olym

and platform diving in 1928.
However, Norton Thornton, Stanford
swimming coach, still picks the United
States with its array of stars to win
the springboard diving. In platform
diving, Farid Samaika of Egypt should
garner the greatest number of points.

was a member of the U.C.L.A. team, he
will compete for his native country.

team in springboard diving include a

Smith, Senior National Outdoor A.A.U.
champion, A1 Green, Central Associa
tion A.A.U. champion, and John Riley
Galitzen, former national champion, are
among the major contenders.
I Thornton picks for the United States
springboard diving team: Mickey Gu

In the platform diving Mickey Riley
Galitzen is America's sole hope to de
