# ROOKIE WITH BRAVES
## 
### 

Bob Brown, the rookie pitcher now
working with the Boston Braves, is
making a good showing. Ho was born
in a Boston suburb only twenty years
ago and learned how to hurl in high
school. The Braves signed him up
when he was but eighteen years old,
and farmed him out to various minor
league clubs.
