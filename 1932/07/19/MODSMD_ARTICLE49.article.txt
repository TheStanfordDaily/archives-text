# GALLERY DISPLAYS SYMBOLISTIC WORK OF PUEBLO INDIANS
## Paintings Depict Ceremonial Dances As Portrayed By Southwest Artists 
### 
Paintings by the Pueblo Indians of
the Southwest are on exhibition in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery.
These paintings depict various cere
monial dances and are all symbolistic
in style.
The drawings of the famous artist,
Ma Po We, are included in the exhibi
tion, and the work of Oqua Pi, depict
ing the battle of the Thunderbirds,
which in Indian mythology denotes the
coming of thunder and rainstorms, is
especially valuable as historical record.
An interesting piece is the illustra
tion of the Shalako dance, which is the
main dance of the Zuni Pueblo, and is
held after the first snowfall, in cele
bration of the harvest season. There
is, in the center of the drawing, a pic
ture of the huge 17-foot high effigy
called the Shalako, around which the
dance is built. The effigy is surrounded
by gayly colored fun-makers who play
pranks during the dance.
Butterfly Dance Shown
An illustration of the most beautiful
of all Indian dances is that of the
Butterfly Dance. The costumes for the
men and women are shown, and the
large Katchina, or headdress, worn by
the women, is especially remarkable.
Many of the paintings show war
dances which are still given in memory
of famous tribal victories. The feath
ers, dangling from long poles held by
the dancers, are symbolic of the scalps
which have been won.
Children Revealed Sccrets
Some work by two small Indian
children is shown in this collection,
and the children have incurred tribal
disfavor by revealing the closely
guarded secrets of the pueblo. The
work of a small Navajo boy is a copy
of one of the secret sand paintings
which were never supposed to have
been revealed. It is the custom for the
saind-painters to dest"oy their work
once it is finished.
The paintings on exhibition show
units from many other dances, and il
lustrate the costumes which are used.
White men are not allowed to view any
but a few of the dances, and the artists
who have broken tribal tradition by
recording them have been denied cer
tain privileges, and debarred from us
ing their family names.
Collection Started by Lemds
Pedro J. Letnos, director of the Art
Gallery, collected these paintings. Iti
commenting on them, Lemos said:
"These paintings are the truest form
of American art. In foreign countries,
America has no recognized national
art, except the work of these Indians,
and the art of the future will embrace
the same symbolic principles as this
primitive work. It is true that this is
the largest collection of work by In
dian artists existing. In view of the
significance of the art as a foundation
for modern art, these works take on
an added impox-tance."
