# MARIVAUX'S BEST WORK TO BE GIVEN HERE
## 
### 

Carrying out the old idea of a play within a play, "Love and
Chance," to be presented here tonight, retaains the French atmosphere,
bringing out Marivaux's subtle wit. The 1730 atmosphere is reproduced
with authentic detail, which may have come from Watteau or Fragonard.
