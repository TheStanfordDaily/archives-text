When a hotel refuses to take money,
that's news. And that is just what
happened to Dean Hoover of the Stan
ford School of Engineering. For in
checking out of a hotel in Sonora,
after a two-day meeting of the state,
chamber of commerce conservation ;
committee, he was told to keep his
money, that the bill had been paid. i
Much surprised, Dean Hoover asked
who had paid it; but the reply was 1
merely that it had been paid. Still j
puzzled, he came away.
Now the hotel claims that it "under- ,
stood" that the chamber of commerce j
was going to pay the bill. But the ,
chamber refuses to pay.
So the situation now stands with the j
hotel wanting its money, Dean Hoover '
willing to pay, and the chamber of;
commerce calling the situation "too
delicate to discuss."
