Addressed by Roth
Comptroller Roth explained to the ;
editors that the church is non-sec- j
tarian and has ministers of all denomi- !
nations to preach. "It is unique," he i
said, "in that it has no membership i
and no formal organization. It holds a i
place in Stanford sentiment because |
here are held the baccalaureate and
commencement exercises, and here |
many Stanford marriages are solemn
ized."
The Comptroller briefly sketched the !
plans of the future development of the j
University, with the men students and j
their activities grouped at the eastern
side of the campus, the women at the
west, and the faculty residences in the t
hills.
In closing he made humorous refer- |
ence to the widespread belief that
Stanford is so rich that it needs no
money. "We do make a pretty good
showing," he admitted, "as a good
many people without enough money j
have learned to do in these days."

Addressed by Roth
Comptroller Roth explained to the ;
editors that the church is non-sec- j
tarian and has ministers of all denomi- !
nations to preach. "It is unique," he i
said, "in that it has no membership i
and no formal organization. It holds a i
place in Stanford sentiment because |
here are held the baccalaureate and
commencement exercises, and here |
many Stanford marriages are solemn
ized."
The Comptroller briefly sketched the !
plans of the future development of the j
University, with the men students and j
their activities grouped at the eastern
side of the campus, the women at the
west, and the faculty residences in the t
hills.
