# Lutz Avers U.S. Tax Low As Compared To European
## 
### 
Although American t.ixes have been |
considerably raised in the past fewl
years, Ihcy are light compared with j
those which Europeans have to carry, |
; according to Dr. Harley L. Lutz, in- j
| ternally known tax expert.
"There is no way of relieving public I
property tax except control of public |
expenditures," Dr. Lutz explained. :
j "And control means getting one's I
i money's worth."
Although the state of New York and j
California rank close to the top of the j
list in the matter of heavy taxation, j
' Nevada, despite her small population, j
is not far behind. Dr. Lutz pointed out !
that until there are fewer counties j
and precincts, high taxes will endure. ;
When questioned about the effect of j
the bonus bill if passed, Dr. Lutz re- j
I plied that no matter how the bill is
j worded, its results will be adverse to ,
j (he lowering of public taxes. Although!

it may not affect the taxpayer immedi
ately, sooner or later it will mean a j
greater levy. Congress must either I
borrow money, print new bills, or tax j
the public, and the latter method, ac- I
cording to Dr. Lutz, would be undesir- j
able.
"Although there is a large postal ;
deficit, it was not caused by the first
class mail," Dr. Lutz stated. "It has j
resulted from the fact that other mail j
has been carried for less than cost, |
and to make up that expense an in- '
creased tax upon first class mail was i
effected.
"There are too many things incor- j
rectly taxed which could be handled :
much more economically. We must
reach that state through correct gov- j
ernment."
Dr. Lutz taught at Stanford until i
four years ago, since when he has been j
professor of economics at Princeton.
