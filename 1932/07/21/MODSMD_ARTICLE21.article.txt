# WILBUR VISITS STANFORD ON PACIFIC TOUR
## Secretary Of Interior Spends Wednesday Here, In San Francisco Today Holds Hoover Re-election Is Greatest Problem Facing United States 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was visiting
the Department of the Interior's office
in San Francisco today, after having
spent yesterday on the campus.

Secretary Wilbur, on being asked
what he considers the most important
problem facing the people of the United
States, promptly replied, "The most
important problem before the people
of our country as well as the world,
and a problem which our people can
reach a decision upon, is the re-elec
tion of Herbert Hoover as President of
the United States.
"After several years of harsh ex
perience he is being turned to from all
sides as the best-informed, the best
placed, and the most capable man to
meet the distressed situation in which
the peoples of our nation and of the
world find themselves."
Spirits of People Excellent
On his inspection tour of Indian
reservations and government projects
through the Middlewest and Northwest,
Secretary Wilbur said he found the
spirit of the people excellent.
"Wherever I've gone," he remarked,
"1 have found the crops ample, the
spirit good, and, while the people have
been worried and concerned, they arc
holding steadyâ€”not jumping the track.
They are not going up in the air, but
are staying on the ground."
Secretary Wilbur had no comments
to offer on University affairs, except
an expression of admiration for the
excellent way in which Dr. Robert E.
Swain, who is acting president during
his leave of absence, is conducting
those affairs .
Here For a Week or More
He declared he had nothing to say
about his own personal plans, because
he has none formulated in advance.
However, he knows definitely that he
expects to be around here for a week
or so.
His present tour began when he went
to Buffalo to represent President
Hoover in connection with that city's
centennial celebration. There he par
ticipated at the unveiling ceremonies
of the statutes of Millard Fillmore and
Grover Cleveland.
And being that far out of Washing
ton, and so near the West, he says, he
thought he would take advantage of
the opportunity to look into various
projects under his secretarial supervi
sion nearer this coast. How long ho
will be here, or exactly what matters
he will be called upon to attend, he
doesn't know.
Adopted by Blackfoot Indians
From Buffalo he came through Min
nesota and North Dakota, and visited
the Blackfoot and Flathead Indian
reservations in Montana. The Black
feet adopted Mrs. Wilbur and Dr. Wil
bur into the tribe, conferring on Mrs.
Wilbur the name "Good Victory" and
upon Dr. Wilbur the title of "Eagle."
On the Flathead reservation he in
spected the Flathead river power site
and the proposed sites of two projected
dams, in connection with the irriga
tion undertaking that is under way
there.
His next inspection was centered
about the immense new Columbia
river basin project. On this phase of
the trip he visited Spokane, Wenatchee,
Ellensburg, and Yakima, and partici
pated in the dedication of the Kittetas
irrigation project.
He dedicated the Owyhee dam in
Oregon, the highest irrigation ploject
in the world, which rises to a height
of 417 feet above bedrock. It will be
surpassed in height, however, by the
Hoover dam.
