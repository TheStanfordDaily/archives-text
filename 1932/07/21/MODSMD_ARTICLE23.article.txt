# STANFORD WELCOMES THE N.E.A
## 
### 
As host for an hour to .'5OO (and more) members of the
National Editorial Association, the Division of Journalism a
sustaining member of the N.E.A.—has published this special
edition of the Staniohd Daily to welcome its visitors and to
give them a modicum of information concerning Stanford.
We rejoice at your coming. We regret that you could be here
only a short time. An hour's tour of the campus suflices to reveal
little more than its two "major" points of interest the Memorial'
(.hurch and Herbert Hoover's home. Roth are well worth seeing,.!
but they afford an inadequate picture of our I'nivcrsitv life.
Most editors—particularly those of the National Editorial j
Association recognize thai college men and women are little |
different trom other young people. You recognize that occur
rences which go to make up the lives of the former are funda
mentally no different from the events which make the warp and
woof of the lives of the latter.
doubtless treat university news as news, evaluated on!
basis ot a normal healthy appetite for information concerning!
things that are worth while. Unfortunately, a few of our craft
seem to regard happenings at a college or university as mud to
be plastered all over the front page. These seem to see events j
only in the light of personalities involved, and if such persons
can be called "collegian," there results a lurid story.
It was a statesman of the 19th century who declared that
"an educated mind is the guardian genius of democracy." If this 1
be true it would seem well to seek to understand the problems
ol university life and to deal with them sympathetically.
Newspapers and the universities have a great deal in com-!
mon, in that each is a major educational force in present-dav j
life.
