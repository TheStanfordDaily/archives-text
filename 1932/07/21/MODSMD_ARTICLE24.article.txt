Stanford lias achieved an enviable place among Western
colleges both in respect to its athletic achievements as well as
its scholastic attainments; yet there is another institution func
tioning 011 its campus which is seldom mentioned, but which is
nevertheless molding the minds and characters of the old and
new student alike. It is a characteristic which has time and time
again been associated with the spirit of the West; theoretically,
il is supposed to operate in every college of the country where
young people are thrown together, but actually it seldom exists.
II is the antithesis of snobbery; in short, it is democracy.
I he loundcrs of Leland Stanford I'niversitv endowed their
educational plant with the spirit of democracy as well as an
abundance of individualism. Fortunately this democratic mani
festation has survived the test of time, and today exists in the
familiar "Hello!" greeting to all new students, and of course old
friends.
Nothing is so expressive of good will and so indicative of a
welcoming attitude as this short for mof salutation. It has made
you at home, and it is up to you to pass the friendly old tradition
on to others.
During the summer quarter, the practice has a tendency to
die out, due possibly to the change in the make-up of the student
body or the "here today—gone tomorrow" feeling prevailing
among the individuals concerned. However, that is a situation
which may easily be remedied. Nowhere are friendships more
easily made than at college, and oftentimes they are continued
long after the coveted degree is stored away in the chest or
attic.
Ihink it over. Certainly the elfort required to exchange a
casual greeting is little compared to the gratifying results which
are inevitably obtained.
