Startling exposures reveal the fact llijil Stanford's most
popular seminar was omitted from the iisl of courses when the

"\\ liv Hoover Is Certain to Win," "Why Roosevelt Can't Lose,"
"Hard rimes," "Harder Times," "Why Gopher Prairie Gave Me
the (fate Instead of the Key to the City," and "Four-Foot Trout
and I low to (latch Them."

terenees ol J. I'. Morgan, or the American Council of Education?

exchange opinions, cigarettes, and matches in the modernized
cracker-barrel seminar, popularly known as the bull session.
