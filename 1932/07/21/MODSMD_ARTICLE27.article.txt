THE MAN FROM YESTERDAY—At
the Stanford Theatre.
This is another saga of alleged "vehr
boten and unrequited love." Claudette
Colbert meets Officer Clive Brook on
the Western Front, they marry, then
the bridegroom is abruptly ordered to
duty. He is reported missing. Years
later, gassed and shell-shocked, he
stumbles across her in Switzerland,
but she is now in love with a French
physician. Realizing he has only a short
time to live, and that he is unfit for
her. Brook nonchalantly enters a night
club, and drinks himself to death.
The story is trite, the acting indif
ferent. Husky-voiced Claudette seems
to be in a mental coma all through the
picture, as is the suave Mr. Brook, who
portrays emotion by raising his eye
brows and pursing his lips. —E.L.

WINNER TAKE ALL—Blanco's, Moun
tain View..Now Playing.
With a corner on the type of lead
that depicts the hard-living profes
sional athlete, James Cagney again
scores in another of his favorite roles.
This time it's as a lightweight bruiser
who looks at life from the ring and
runs into plenty of laughable situa
tions.
The result is a story as brisk and
slashing as the "kid" himself turned
loose in a Kleig-lighted ring. And for
once we find a lead who doesn't need
a double. Cagney does his own fight
ing, and so well that we suspect that
he had seen plenty of action before
Hollywood ever saw him.

This picture not only gives you ihe

shows you the heart that drives the
pugilist either to punch-drunk oblivion
or through battering campaign to a
championship. —R.W.S.

cal expert and adviser to the Cam
bridge University Press, has made a

paper of today, with a full account of

OWEN I). YOUNG—By Ida M. Tar
bell. Macmillan Co., $3.(10. At
the Stanford Bookstore.
In style Ida Tarbell has captured
that same vivacious quality which is
so much a part of this modern person
ality, Owen D. Young.
Authors of the past few years have
taken often to rummaging through the
dust of centuries to spin their volumi
nous yarns on every subject from
Moses to the beer recipes of George
Washington. There is no taint of the
musty past in this book. Miss Tarbell
holds refreshingly aloof from the static
past to strike off a pulsating picture
of this American who is very much
alive.
For the collegian this work should
be of special interest. There is no
doubt that Owen D. Young has "ar
rived." And "arriving" some day is a
universal dream not infrequently in
dulged in by members of this college
generation.
How Young got there, and what in
fluences shaped his career are ques
tions of keen interest to Miss Tarbell
in this penetrating biography. And it
might be said that through the me
dium of her subject she has made a
valuable contribution in setting up a
few guide posts, interesting and useful
to the youth of today with his prob
lems.
If you want to know a big man
you'll appreciate this inspiring biog
raphy. If you would follow a life filled
with little problems and big, many of
which parallel our own, you will find
this practical reading. And if you enjoy
the romantic story of the lad who
makes good in the big city and still
puts "Van Hornesville, N.Y.," instead
of Park Avenue, N.Y.," after his name
on the hotel register you will find it in
"Owen D. Young." —R.W.S.

j FIGHTING FOR FUN —By Eddie
Eagan. Macmillan, $2.50.
| One of the 70,000 spectators who saw
j the Sharkey-Schmeling fight was Eddie
Eagan, amateur heavyweight champion
I of the world.
Harry Hansen says of his book in
I the New York World-Telegram: "He
| has packed into it snappy stories of
ringside battles . . . Eddie won his title
lat the Olympic Games in Antwerp
when he socked the Norwegian, Sors
dal—'a huge, red-headed boxer, raw
boned and exuding strength'—in the
final. But that was only one of the
J fights that made him famous—and
' happy."
Eddie Eagan, graduate of three uni
-1 versities and a Rhodes scholar, tells in
"Fighting for Fun" of his walloping
career, and of why he refused to be
) come a "pro."
