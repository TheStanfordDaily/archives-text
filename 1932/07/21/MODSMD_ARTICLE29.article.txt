# Vagaries.. of a vagabond mind

### Theodor Dierks 
Swimming pool ... a fiery sun beat
-1 ing down upon white concrete, and
[ nude figures reclining voluptuously as
j the rays of "Ra" seep into their inner
| beings . . . the tinkling of falling drops
; of water as someone dives into the
I pool, and the ever-widening circles of
| re flected light on the water . . . tree
| tops, seen over the fence, swaying in
i dolently in the heated breeze, and the
j etched outline they make against the
| coppery sky overhead . . . then, the
I scene abruptly changed to one of ac
| tion and hurrying forms as a whistle
j blows and the shout, Advanced class,
I over here," breaks the sultry silence
|. . . Swimming pool.

Speed , . . That joyous feeling as
' the wind blows against your lace, and
i plays and purls and tugs with and
around your hair . . . the banshee
| like wail of the tires as a curve is
taken at a fust pace, and the moment
; of indecision as you wonder if you are
going to make it . . . the sensation
(hat you and the machine are one, as
- the road flows by like a belt, and the
' motor hisses and purrs under your
j ready foot . . . the complete letdown
as you hear the whine of the speed
! cop's siren as he comes up behind
i you . . . Speed.

Show in Paly . . . the selection of a
i seat, and the settling down in it . . .
I the squirmings and wrigglings as a
comfortable position is sought before
the feature starts . . . the hearty laugh
! ter accorded a good gag, and the pain
, the clenched muscles give after the
J laugh . . . the whispering and hand
i holding about you, and the wish that
you could indulge in a little of it
! yourself . . . the faint idea that this
i show isn't so good after all, and the
I loss of interest in it . . . Show in Paly.
