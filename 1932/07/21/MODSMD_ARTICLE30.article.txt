# STANFORD CAN'T ESCAPE LEGEND OF ITS WEALTH
## Was Richest University When Founded But Is No Longer So In Recent Years Institution Has Received Millions In Gifts 
### 
Stanford University opened its doors
to students for the first time on
October 1, 1891, a memorial by Sena
tor and Mrs. Leland Stanford to their
only child, Leland Stanford, Jr., and
endowed with their entire fortune,
something more than twenty-one mil
lion dollars. The University forthwith
gained a reputation as the most richly
endowed in the country, a reputation
that persists in spite of the fact that
it is no longer true.
At the time of its founding Stanford
was, indeed, the wealthiest university
in the country, ultimately it may be
so again, but at present, although its
endowment has been increased to
nearly thirty-one million dollars, it
ranks only sixth in wealth among
American universities, and is far sur
passed in that respect by several.
During the forty years since Stan
ford was founded munificent gifts to
the great universities in the centers
of population have immensely in
creased their resources, so that now
as against Stanford's $31,000,000, Har
vard has $108,000,000, Yale $94,-
000,000, Columbia $80,000,000, Chicago
$60,000,000, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology $34,000,000. Closely ap
proaching Stanford's educational funds
are Johns Hopkins, University of
Texas, and Rochester, with twenty
eight or twenty-nine millions each.
In the meantime the costs of pres
ent-day education have greatly in
creased since the earlier days, so that
Stanford finds itself hard-pressed to
maintain its high standards in the
work it has undertaken and is unable
to enter many fields m which, with
adequate finances, it could perform
great service.
Limits Student Body
Within recent years, however, the
tide has turned in Stanford's favor,
for practiaclly all the fifty per cent
addition to its endowment has come
to it in only a little more than a
decade. Its future is assured; it has all
the ground it can conceivably need
for physical expansion and the ac
commodation of schools of all sorts,
it has from the beginning maintained
high standards, preferring to limit its
student body rather than to expand in
numbers at the expense of quality,
and it is situated in a region that will
inevitably grow in population and
wealth.
When Stanford opened in 1891 it
was expected that about one hundred
students would be received; instead
there were 559. The first faculty num
bered thirty-seven. The student body
has been kept down by high require
ments for admission and for remain
ing in the University to a little more
than thirty-five hundred and the fac
ulty has grown from thirty-seven to
nearly GOO.
Graduate Students Increase
By a provision in the Founding
Grant at a time when the whole stu
dent body numbered not much over a
thousand, the number of women at
tending the University at any time is
strictly limited to 500. Limitation of
men is accomplished by restricting the
number admitted each year to fresh
man and sophomore standing. The al
lotment is determined each year on
the recommendation of the president
of the University with a view to
keeping the total registration around
the thirty-five hundred mark. At
present 450 men with less than junior
standing can be accepted at the be
ginning of the college year, and fifty
more at the beginning of the next
quarter.
As is the case with most of the
great universities, the proportion of
graduate students is steadily mount
ing. During the last decade their num
ber at Stanford has risen from 480
in 1921 to 1580 in 1931. In 1921 350
degrees were granted; in 1931 there
were 1204, of which about 400 were
advanced degreesâ€”that is, there were
more advanced degrees then than the
total of all degrees a decade before.
Interwoven into Stanford's early
history are threads of sorrow and of
hardship and heroic devotion in
periods of tragic misfortune that, have
permanently colored the fabric of
Stanford character.
Gift to the Youth of the Nation
The University was founded in sad
ness as a gift to all the youth of the
country in memory of a son and only
child. Leland Stanford was one of the
pioneer upbuilders of California and
the West. Beginning his career in
California as a merchant in the early
years of gold he and his devoted
young wife climbed up from years in
which she did all the housework to a
comfortable competence and to lead
ership in the community. Stanford
was one of the four men who had the
courage to drive through the western
link of the transcontinental railroad
which had been dreamed about and
hoped for for years, with nobody dar
ing to undertake its construction. It
was an undertaking of immense dis
couragements, faced many times with
almost insuperable difficulties. Stan
ford was California's war-time gover
nor and held the state loyal to the
Union. He became United States sena-
