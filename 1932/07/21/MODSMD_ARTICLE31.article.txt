# HOOVERS HAD THEIR HOME ON THE CAMPUS YEARS BEFORE PRESENT HOUSE WAS BUILT

### 
The Hoovers have had their home on the Stanford campus practically ever
since they were married not long after their graduation from Stanford. At least
three different houses here were in succession their legal residence before the
time when, a little before the outbreak of the World War, they built the one
that is their home.
Their sons went to the primary and grammar school on the campus, to the
Palo Alto High School, and to Stanford University. Their Stanford home was
in those early years, as recently, unoccupied by them for long intervals when
Hoover's business as a mining engineer took him to all parts of the world, but
they regarded Stanford as their residence. In those days, however, the Hoover
house was not as now the objective of thousands of interested tourists.
The present house is the outgrowth of Mrs. Hoover's plans. That is, she
laid out floor plans—and especially roof-floor plans—and called Professor
Arthur Bridgman Clark, an architect and professor in charge of the University's
art instruction, to design a house around them.
It is not a big house, but it has more rooms than most houses of its size
because Mrs. Hoover's desire was for a series of them, on different levels, open
to the sky and sunshine—and on warm days to the shade. The result is that the
flat roofs and terraces, connected by short flights of steps, afford outdoor
"rooms," with views of the campus and surrounding hills and mountains in all
directions, and here the Hoovers receive and converse with their friends when
they are at their Stanford home.
