# TOWERING PALO ALTO TREE HAS FIGURED IN ALL THE HISTORY OF NEIGHBORHOOD
## 
### 
The Palo Alto tree, the lone redwood that stands at the edge of the
campus, has stood there and been noted in the pages of history since the
earliest of recorded annals. It was doubtless standing there when Columbus
discovered America.
It was a landmark to the first white men and probably to the Indians
before the white men came. The Mission Fathers rested at its base in their
journeys up and down El Camino Real. El Palo Alto, the Spaniards called it,
that is, in Spanish, the tall stake. Originally there was a twin tree, but it
succumbed many years ago. Fears are expressed for the health of the tree
still remaining, and the University has shored up its roots with a concrete
buttress against the attacks of the San Francisquito creek when, in winter
and springtime floods it tears past the old tree's base.
It gave the name to Senator Stanford's ranch and country estate, and
appears on the University seal.
When the college city was laid out at the edge of the campus it was
given the name of the old monarch.
