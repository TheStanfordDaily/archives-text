# STUDENTS IN CONTROL OF DISCIPLINE OF THEIR OWN FELLOWS
## 
### 
Stanford students very largely con
trol their own conduct as well as main
tain their own corporate affairs. "The
largest liberty consistent with good
work and good order is allowed," in
the University's official words.

In matters of discipline, hearings
and decisions on charges are made by
two student councils, one for men and
one for women, and the verdicts of
these student councils are made final
by the approval of the president of
the University.

tor and held that office at the time
of his death in 1893.
Upon their only son the Stanfords
built afl their hopes. He was a
thoughtful boy who gave promise of
becoming a benefactor of his fellow
men. A youthful enthusiasm, growing
out of his boyhood collections on the
family's country home on the Palo
Alto farm, was to establish a public
museum. Then suddenly, while travel
ing with his parents, he sickened and
after a brief illness with what was
known as "the Roman fever," died in
Italy, March 13, 1884, at the age of
16.
Out of their deep grief came the
Stanfords' plan to found on their Palo
Alto ranch an educational institution
to extend to many generations of
youths the educational opportunities to
develop themselves into useful citi
zens. They worked with energy, visited
many universities, consulted educators,
organized their ideas. The act author
izing the University was passed by
the California legislature, approved
March 9, 1885, Senator Stanford's
birthday, less than a year after the
boy's death. The Founding Grant,
executed November 11 of that year,
was made public at a meeting of the
Board of Trustees in the Stanfords'
San Francisco residence November 14.
The cornerstone of the Inner Quad
rangle was laid May 14, 1887, the
birthday of the boy in whose memory
the University was being built.
University Funds Tied Up
In the meantime architects had been
engaged and had drawn up the
scheme of the characteristic Stanford
arcaded buildings around open courts,
and the Stanfords were still consult
ing and planning; they selected the
young David Starr Jordan as presi
dent, with power to select a faculty
and organize academic details, and in
1891, with the Inner Quadrangle com
pleted except for the Church, a series
of engineering and laboratory build
ings furnished, the museum erected,
and dormitories for men and women
students and some residences fbr the
faculty ready, the University was
opened.
The young university was only fair
ly launched when, two years after
its opening, came the sudden death of
Governor Stanford followed at once
by a suit, which although it was, as
court decisions demonstrated, unjusti
fied, nevertheless tied up all the Uni
versity's funds during three bitter and
anxious years of litigation. Mrs. Stan
ford, the surviving founder, struggled
with noble self-sacrifice to keep the
institution open, even though she was
advised from many quarters to aban
don the struggle. She utilized all her
private resources, cutting her personal
expenditures and pledging her jewels
to eke out the slender funds available.
Faculty men voluntarily gave up por
tions of their salaries in order to
help tide over. Then in 1896 the suit
finally ended in a victory for the
University in the United States Su
preme Court and the estate was dis
tributed.
Out of this era of struggle and com
mon sacrifice for the life of the Uni
versity developed a spirit of loyalty
and enthusiasm among the early fac
ulty and students which was handed
down to their successors and lias
formed the Stanford spirit and char
acter,
