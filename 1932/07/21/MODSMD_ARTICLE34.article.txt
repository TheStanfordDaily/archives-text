# MUSEUM EMBODIES AMBITION OF THE STANFORDS' SON
## 
### 
The Leland Stanford Junior Museum
perpetuates the boyhood ambition of
the Stanfords' son to establish a pub
lic museum in San Francisco. He was
engaged in collecting toward this ob
ject at the time of his death. He had
begun with the skeleton of a series
which he planned to build up to a
historical display of the development
of war methods, and of another to
show the development oT industry.
Just before he was seized with his
fatal illness his interest had been
aroused in ancient glass.
The museum is a special memorial
to the boy and this ambition. In it are
contained his own childish collections
of eggs and specimens gathered on
the Palo Alto Farm and of some of
the later collections he made as he
grew older. There are also other per
sonal mementoes of the family.
Especially good Oriental and Egyp
tian collections are contained in the
museum, collected by Mrs. Stanford
on a tour of the Orient and by Mr.
Timothy Hopkins, a trustee of the
University.
"Governor Stanford No. 1"
There is an interesting collection
depicting early California history. The
first locomotive of the Central Pacific
in California, the "Governor Stanford
No. 1," has been installed in one
room, and elsewhere is the famous
last spike driven in the building of
the Central Pacific, and the hammer
with which Governor Stanford drove
it. Twenty-three golden double eagles
were used in the casting of this spike.
These were taken by David Hewes, a
brother-in-law of Mrs. Stanford, to a
San Francisco goldsmith, who cast the
spike and sent it to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the railroad line
ended.
On the golden spike is inscribed the
date, "May 13, 1869." As a result of
delays which frequently could not be
foreseen in pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was actually driven
a few days later.
Prehistoric Fossils
Fossils make up an interesting part
of the displays. A large collection of
these was turned over to the institu
tion by Dr. David Starr Jordan, first
president of the University. A group
of restoration drawings of fossils are
shown, showing how fish looked when
they were alive at a period which
many scientists believe was more than
a million years ago.
An excellent collection of early
American and colonial material may
be found in the museum. It contains
a check written and signed by George
Washington. A musket used by some
patriot of '76 is included in the group.
Early Concrete Building
The building which houses the Mu
seum is interesting, in that it was the
first reinforced concrete structure ever
erected. Friends of Senator Stanford
tried to dissuade him from the idea of
erecting a building wholly of iron and
cement, but without avail. When the
work was under way he made fre
quent visits to Palo Alto to be sure
that the cement was properly mixed
and that the reinforcing was done in
accordance with his ideas.
So carefully was the construction
carried through that the building
withstood the earthquake of 1906 un
damaged, although additions that had
been made to the original structure in
later years were badly damaged.

Especially good Oriental and Egyp
tian collections are contained in the
museum, collected by Mrs. Stanford
on a tour of the Orient and by Mr.
Timothy Hopkins, a trustee of the
University.
"Governor Stanford No. 1"
There is an interesting collection
depicting early California history. The
first locomotive of the Central Pacific
in California, the "Governor Stanford
No. 1," has been installed in one
room, and elsewhere is the famous
last spike driven in the building of
the Central Pacific, and the hammer
with which Governor Stanford drove
it. Twenty-three golden double eagles
were used in the casting of this spike.
These were taken by David Hewes, a
brother-in-law of Mrs. Stanford, to a
San Francisco goldsmith, who cast the
spike and sent it to Promontory, Utah,
near Ogden, where the railroad line
ended.
On the golden spike is inscribed the
date, "May 13, 1869." As a result of
delays which frequently could not be
foreseen in pioneer days of railroad
building, the spike was actually driven
a few days later.
Prehistoric Fossils
Fossils make up an interesting part
of the displays. A large collection of
these was turned over to the institu
tion by Dr. David Starr Jordan, first
president of the University. A group
of restoration drawings of fossils are
shown, showing how fish looked when
they were alive at a period which
many scientists believe was more than
a million years ago.
An excellent collection of early
American and colonial material may
be found in the museum. It contains
a check written and signed by George
Washington. A musket used by some
patriot of '76 is included in the group.
Early Concrete Building
The building which houses the Mu
seum is interesting, in that it was the
first reinforced concrete structure ever
erected. Friends of Senator Stanford
tried to dissuade him from the idea of
erecting a building wholly of iron and
cement, but without avail. When the
work was under way he made fre
quent visits to Palo Alto to be sure
that the cement was properly mixed
and that the reinforcing was done in
accordance with his ideas.
So carefully was the construction
carried through that the building
withstood the earthquake of 1906 un
damaged, although additions that had
been made to the original structure in
later years were badly damaged.
The Leland Stanford Junior Museum
perpetuates the boyhood ambition of
the Stanfords' son to establish a pub
lic museum in San Francisco. He was
engaged in collecting toward this ob
ject at the time of his death. He had
begun with the skeleton of a series
which he planned to build up to a
historical display of the development
of war methods, and of another to
show the development oT industry.
Just before he was seized with his
fatal illness his interest had been
aroused in ancient glass.
The museum is a special memorial
to the boy and this ambition. In it are
contained his own childish collections
of eggs and specimens gathered on
the Palo Alto Farm and of some of
the later collections he made as he
grew older. There are also other per
sonal mementoes of the family.
