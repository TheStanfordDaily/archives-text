# LIBRARY PROVIDES FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF THE UNIVERSITY
## Building So Constructed As To Permit Expansion As Needed 
### 
The present library building is the
third that the University has occupied
in the forty years of its existence. The
first was a one-story building in the
Inner Quadrangle, now occupied by
the Law School library, which alone
overcrowds it.
The second was in the building on
the Outer Quadrangle now occupied
by the administrative officers of the
University. This building was the gift
of Thomas Welton Stanford, brother
of Senator Stanford, who was asso
ciated with him in his early Cali
fornia days and later went to Austra
lia, where he became wealthy. He
turned back to the University the
money left him by Senator Stanford's
will.
Building Planned For Growth
The present library, built in 1919 at
a cost of $648,000, is so planned that
it can be extended in three directions
to accommodate future growth of the
student body and of the library col
lections.
It is in the center of what will be
the second of the series of three main
quadrangles, which embodies the ori
ginal plan of the architects. The only
other building of the quadrangle so
far erected is the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery, also the gift of
the founder's brother, built in 1917, at
a cost of $80,000. Stanford also gave
the University at this time many
paintings which he had gathered dur
ing his lifetime.

The University Library contained at
the beginning of the present college
year 406,622 volumes. In addition the
departments each possess their own
small library. The law library, with
nearly 37,000 volumes, and the Bran
ner Geological Library, with more
than 10,000 volumes, are housed in
different buildings, while in San Fran
cisco the Lane Medical Library, with
something more than 73,500 volumes,
constituting one of the finest medical
school libraries in the country, is
housed in a particularly beautiful
building in the medical school group,
which was erected some years ago at
a cost of somewhat more than $160,000.

Story Of The Jewel Fund
The "Jewel Fund,'' $500,000 which
provides an annual income devoted
exclusively to the purchase of books,
commemorates a romance of self
sacrifice in the early days of the Uni
versity which is embodied also in the
University bookplate. During the days
after Senator Stanford's death when
the University funds were tied up by
a lawsuit, Mrs. Stanford in her des
perate efforts to provide the money to
keep the University open, tried to sell
or pawn her jewels for that purpose.
She left the jewels to the trustees
with instruction to sell them when
they could be disposed of advanta
geously and to devote the proceeds to
the purchase of books. Thus was es
tablished the Jewel Fund.
The bookplate was executed by
Edwin Blashfield, the great mural
painter, who at first refused to design
anything so minute as a bookplate.
When he heard the story of the
jewels, however, he undertook the
commission and the plate he submit
ted shows a woman offering jewels to
the goddess of wisdom.
