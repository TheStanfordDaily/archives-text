# HOOVER'S COLLEGE MONEY NOT EARNED WAITING ON TABLE
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover did not wait on
tables at Stanford, despite the romantic
story that it was thus that he met Lou
Henry who later became his wife.
Hoover did earn his way through the
University, but it was by more original
devices than the traditional waiting on
tables. Even then Hoover was noted
for his organizing ability and it was
through organizing—a laundry agency,
for example—that he provided the
necessary funds.
Hoover's organizing instincts were
utilized for the benefit of the student
body, also, for he made over the early
chaotic methods of handling student
finances and athletic funds and put
them on a sound basis.
