# CHURCH IS POINT OF MAIN INTEREST FOR ALL VISITORS
## Beautified With Mosaics It Is In Harmony With Mission Style 
### 
The Founders of Stanford laid on '
the conductors of the University the
duty "to prohibit sectarian instruction,
but to have taught in the University
the immortality of the soul, the exis
tence of an all-wise and benevolent
Creator, and that obedience to His
laws is the highest duty of man." In
accordance with those provisions there
are services in the University Me
morial Church every Sunday, with
sermons by the University chaplain
or by visiting clergymen of various
denominations.
There are also Sunday and mid
week organ recitals by the Univer
sity organist.
The church, which with its magnifi
cent mosaics is a main objective of
every visitor to the campus and famed
throughout the world, was built by
Mrs. Stanford as a memorial to her
husband. It forms the central archi
tectural feature of the central inner
quadrangle group and faces the main
entrance to the University.
Harmonizes With Mission Style
Harmonizing with the mission style
of the other buildings to which it is
linked by the arcade surrounding the
great inner court, it is of modified
Moorish-Romanesque architecture, in
the form of a cross with rounded
ends. The extreme length is one hun
dred and ninety feet, the extreme
with, one hundred and fifty feet.
The exterior finish is like that of
the other quadrangle buildings ex
cept for the mosaics of the facade, the
central feature being a striking repre
sentation of the Sermon on the Mount.
The interior walls are buff sandstone,
with tooled face, relieved by elaborate
carved designs and fiftewnth-century
mosaics of great beauty. The features
of the apse are the marble altar, the
stained glass windows, representing
the Nativity, the Crucifixion, and the
Ascension, and the mosaics covering
the wall surface.
Bible Figures In Stained Glass
Behind the altar is a repica of
Cosimo Rosselli's Last Supper, from
the Sistine Chapel at Rome. To the
right and left, running to the arch of
the apse, are long panels, a gloria dei
angeli surmounted by reproductions in
moisaic of Michelangelo's Prophets.
The cove ceiling is also done in mo
saics representing angels with trump
ets.
The nineteen stained glass windows
of nave, transept, and apse illustrate
the Life of Christ. The windows of the
clerestory contain single figures of
Old and New Testament characters,
and the mosaics depict mostly Old
Testament scenes.
The seating capacity of the church,
including galleries, is about eighteen
hundred.
Rebuilt After Earthquake
The Church was partially destroyed
in the earthquake of 1906, and was
completely rebuilt in 1913. The steeple
which held the clock and bells has
never been replaced, the bells having
been hung, for the time being, in a
tower on the terrace back of the
Church, which also contains the clock
work which operates the chimes in
sounding the Westminster chimes on
| the quarter-hour, and one face of the
original Church clock, which had four.
The mosaics were made and the
designs put together in Italy and
workmen were sent over with them
to place them in the Stanford build
ing.
