Governor Stanford on his Palo Alto
farm in 1878 and 1879 carried through
some photographic experiments which,
although he did not realize that as
pect, were really the first precursors
of the moving picture.
Stanford was an enthusiastic de
veloper of trotting horses and h;id on
his farm a splendidly equipped plant
for breeding and training the wonder
ful prize-winners which he turned out.
He was a careful student of the
subject and carried through to suc
cess many ideas of his own which
ran counter to accepted convictions
of the time, developing thereby many
world-famous record-holders.
Interested in the actions of trotting
horses in motion, with a view toward
perfection of that action, he engaged
Edweard Muybridge, an expert pho
tographer of Sail Francisco, to aid
him in his studies. Ultimately he had
twenty-four cameras in a row, with
electro-shutters, past which a horse
was trotted, making twenty-four con
secutive pictures at close intervals.
These Muybridge was able to show
in a projecting machine, and there
was the germ of the modern moving
picture, although it was not realized
at the time. Governor Stanford was
enabled to study carefully and con
firm his ideas about the actions of his
trotters.
Later similar studies were made of
other animals and of men, with in
teresting Results.
Muybridge took some of the pic
tures to Europe, where they aroused
intense interest. Meissonier, the paint
er, was particularly interested and in
a portrait he painted of Stanford now
in the Stanford museum, included
some of the sheets of these photo
graphs of trotting horses.
