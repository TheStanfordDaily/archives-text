# CAMPUS FOURTH AS BIG AS ALL SAN FRANCISCO
## Fourteen Square Miles Have Been Forever Dedicated To Education Stanford University A Little City In Its Own Domain 
### 
The Stanford campus comprises 8900
acres or approximately 14 square miles

—an area equivalent to a quarter of
the land occupied by the city and
county of San Francisco. It stretches
for about three miles along El Camino
Real, the main highway between San
Francisco and Los Angeles, traversed
in the early days by the Mission
padres, and extends back into the
foothills of the outer Coast Range for
distances averaging nearly five miles.
This is the old Palo Alto Farm of
the Slanfords, and with the exception
of some small tracts acquired after the
University was founded, is, by the
terms of the founding grant forever
inalienable, dedicated in perpetuity to
education and never to be sold.
Palo Alto, the University town, which
was laid out in wheat fields after the
University was founded, is on the edge
of the campus, the other side of the
state highway, a mile away from the
main University buildings. Palo Alto,
established with the idea of being a
college town, has always held closest
community of interests with Stanford
life and affairs, and likewise Stanford
faculty men who live in Palo Alto have
been active in the development and
government of the city. Although tech
nically not including the Stanford
campus, Palo Alto has always regarded
itself as the home of the University;
there has never been any war between
town and gown in this community.
Stanford a Little City
Since the campus is not included in
any municipality, the University con
stitutes a small city in itself and has
to face the problems of a small city. It
maintains its own fire and police de
partments and has its lighting, heating,
water, sewer, and other utilities opera
tions, its own postoffice, shops, res
taurants.
The academic and administrative
buildings and plants are spread on a
plain below the foothills and the resi
dence districts extend from that plain
back toward the mountain range.
Uultimately the portion of the cam
pus grounds not devoted to immediate
educational uses will doubtless become
a source of considerable income, but
they are not now. It is planned eventu
ally to develop large portions of this
land for residence sites available to the
general public on long term leases, but
that project must await further popu
lation growth down the San Francisco
peninsula and the development of an
adequate water supply to supply the
added campus population. Residence on
the campus now has to be restricted
to those connected with the University.
Studies are being made and some ac
tion has been possible toward increas
ing (he water supply through storage
reservoirs for the annual rainfall.
Contributes $2,900,000 a Year
At present such portions of the out
lying campus lands as are productive
of income are rendered so through
leases for grazing, for dairying, and
occasionally in some portions for agri
culture. Some portions of the Stanford
lands are devoted at nominal rentals
to various educational and public pur
poses not directly connected with the
University.
Stanford pays taxes on the greater
portion of its campus. By state statute
the buildings and grounds of all in
stitutions of higher education up to
100 acres are exempt from taxation. By
a special legislative act the income pro
ducing endowment of the University
is exempt. Stanford's present buildings
and improvements cover approximate
ly 97 acres, very close to the 100 acres
that can be exempt. It pays taxes on
all the rest of its campus and on all its
real property holdings—about $50,000 a
year on its real property. It receives
no direct aid from state or federal
government. It contributes annually
$2,900,000 to the cost of public educa
tion.

culture. Some portions of the Stanford
lands are devoted at nominal rentals
to various educational and public pur
poses not directly connected with the
University.
Stanford pays taxes on the greater
portion of its campus. By state statute
the buildings and grounds of all in
stitutions of higher education up to
100 acres are exempt from taxation. By
a special legislative act the income pro
ducing endowment of the University
is exempt. Stanford's present buildings
and improvements cover approximate
ly 97 acres, very close to the 100 acres
that can be exempt. It pays taxes on
all the rest of its campus and on all its
real property holdings—about $50,000 a
year on its real property. It receives
no direct aid from state or federal
government. It contributes annually
$2,900,000 to the cost of public educa
tion.
The Stanford campus comprises 8900
acres or approximately 14 square miles

—an area equivalent to a quarter of
the land occupied by the city and
county of San Francisco. It stretches
for about three miles along El Camino
Real, the main highway between San
Francisco and Los Angeles, traversed
in the early days by the Mission
padres, and extends back into the
foothills of the outer Coast Range for
distances averaging nearly five miles.
This is the old Palo Alto Farm of
the Slanfords, and with the exception
of some small tracts acquired after the
University was founded, is, by the
terms of the founding grant forever
inalienable, dedicated in perpetuity to
education and never to be sold.
Palo Alto, the University town, which
was laid out in wheat fields after the
University was founded, is on the edge
of the campus, the other side of the
state highway, a mile away from the
main University buildings. Palo Alto,
established with the idea of being a
college town, has always held closest
community of interests with Stanford
life and affairs, and likewise Stanford
faculty men who live in Palo Alto have
been active in the development and
government of the city. Although tech
nically not including the Stanford
campus, Palo Alto has always regarded
itself as the home of the University;
there has never been any war between
town and gown in this community.
Stanford a Little City
Since the campus is not included in
any municipality, the University con
stitutes a small city in itself and has
to face the problems of a small city. It
maintains its own fire and police de
partments and has its lighting, heating,
water, sewer, and other utilities opera
tions, its own postoffice, shops, res
taurants.
The academic and administrative
buildings and plants are spread on a
plain below the foothills and the resi
dence districts extend from that plain
back toward the mountain range.
Uultimately the portion of the cam
pus grounds not devoted to immediate
educational uses will doubtless become
a source of considerable income, but
they are not now. It is planned eventu
ally to develop large portions of this
land for residence sites available to the
general public on long term leases, but
that project must await further popu
lation growth down the San Francisco
peninsula and the development of an
adequate water supply to supply the
added campus population. Residence on
the campus now has to be restricted
to those connected with the University.
Studies are being made and some ac
tion has been possible toward increas
ing (he water supply through storage
reservoirs for the annual rainfall.
Contributes $2,900,000 a Year
At present such portions of the out
lying campus lands as are productive
of income are rendered so through
leases for grazing, for dairying, and
occasionally in some portions for agri
culture. Some portions of the Stanford
lands are devoted at nominal rentals
to various educational and public pur
poses not directly connected with the
University.
