# STANFORD WRITERS AIDED BY TRAINING
## Journalism Faculty Men Of Broad Experience 
### 
Th;it Stanford University is exercis
ing an influence in journalism is best
evidenced perhaps by reference to the
scores of Stanford men and women
who are employed as writers, editors,
and managers of publications all over
the country. The names of four of
these men are familiar to every editor.
They are: Karl Bickel, president of the
United Press; Bruce Buven, editor of
the New Republic; Will Irwin, writer
and author of international reputation;
and Merle Thorpe, editor and general
manager of The Nation's Business.

The journalism curriculum at Stan
ford is based on the conviction that
the proper college training for jour
nalism provides (1) a broad founda
tion of general information, (2) more
specific knowledge of economies, politi
cal science, history, and other subjects
with which the journalist largely deals,
and (3) some technical ability in jour
nalism and an intelligent comprehen
sion of the obligations and responsi
bilities of the journalist. Instruction is
organized as a division in the School
of Social Sciences. Enrollment as a
journalism major is restricted to jun
iors, seniors, and graduate students.
Daily Published On Campus
The Stanford Daily, published on the
campus every morning except Satur->
day and Sunday, affords opportunity
for the student to do some actual news
paper work. Many students act as cam

and managers of publications all over
the country. The names of four of
these men are familiar to every editor.

United Press; Bruce Buven, editor of
the New Republic; Will Irwin, writer
and author of international reputation;
and Merle Thorpe, editor and general
manager of The Nation's Business.

The journalism curriculum at Stan
ford is based on the conviction that
the proper college training for jour
nalism provides (1) a broad founda
tion of general information, (2) more
specific knowledge of economies, politi
cal science, history, and other subjects
with which the journalist largely deals,
and (3) some technical ability in jour
nalism and an intelligent comprehen
sion of the obligations and responsi
bilities of the journalist. Instruction is
organized as a division in the School
of Social Sciences. Enrollment as a
journalism major is restricted to jun
iors, seniors, and graduate students.
Daily Published On Campus
The Stanford Daily, published on the
campus every morning except Satur->
day and Sunday, affords opportunity
for the student to do some actual news
paper work. Many students act as cam
pus correspondents for newspapers in
San Francisco, Oakland, and smaller
cities in this vicinity.
Men who combine college training
and broad practical experience make
up the faculty. Everett W. Smith, head
of the division, is a graduate of Stan
ford. He served as reporter and desk
man on metropolitan newspapers in
San Francisco and in New York City,
later ran a weekly paper in Palo Alto,
and for a decade was on the editorial
staff of the Palo Alto Times.

ing an influence in journalism is best
evidenced perhaps by reference to the
scores of Stanford men and women
who are employed as writers, editors,
and managers of publications all over
the country. The names of four of
these men are familiar to every editor.
They are: Karl Bickel, president of the
