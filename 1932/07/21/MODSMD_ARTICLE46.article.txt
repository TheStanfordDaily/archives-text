# STANFORD QUAD IS AN ADAPTATION OF THE EARLY MISSIONS
## 
### 
The architectural design of Stanford
University, with the detailed plan of
the innter quadrangle group, Encina
Hall, and the first three engineering
buildings, was the work of Charles
Allerton Coolidge, of the firm of Shep
ley, Rutan & Coolidge, Boston, Massa
chusetts. The library, men's, gymna
sium, pavilion, Encina dining hall, and
Toyon and Branner halls are the work
of Blakewell & Brown of San Fran
cisco. In these newer buildings the
original plan has been modified some
what to give greater variety and in
terest, but the distinctive features have
been preserved.
The central group of buildings, con
stituting two quadrangles, the one sur
-1 ounding the other, is an adaptation of
the mission architecture, and repro
duces on an imposing scale the open
archcs, long colonnades, and red-tile
roofing of the old Spanish missions of
California. The Inner Quadrangle con
sists of twelve one-story buildings and
the Memorial Church, connected by a
continuous open arcade, and surround
ing a court of 586 feet long by 246
feet wide, or three and a quarter acres.
The buildings are buff sandstone, some
what varied in color, the stonework of
broken ashlar, with rough rock-face,
and the roofs covered with red tile.
The fourteen buildings of the Outer
Quadrangle are constructed of the
same material and in the same general
style as the Inner Quadrangle, with
open arcades on the outside. The ex
treme length of the Outer Quadrangle
is 894 feet.
