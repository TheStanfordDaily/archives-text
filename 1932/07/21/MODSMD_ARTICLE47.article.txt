# UNIVERSITY LACKS DORMITORIES TO HOUSE ITS MEN
## 
### 
Stanford is essentially a residence
University; the ideal is lhat all its stu-.
dents shall be housed on the campus.
The men's dormitories altogether pro
vide quarters for about 1,000 men,
while about 700 men live in fraternity
houses. But for even this proportion
of the 3,000 men students to be cared
for, the dormitory rooms have to be
crowded, Ihree men living in rooms
designed for two. One of the most
pressing needs of the University is for
more dormitories for men.
For the limited number of women
Roble Hall, their dormitory, and the
sorority houses make more nearly ade
quate provision. ,
