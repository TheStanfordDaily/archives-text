# "STANFORD UNIVERSITY" IS NAME AT HOME BIT STRANGERS CALL IT "LELAND STANFORD"
## 
### 
Stanford calls itself Stanford University. That is the name that appears on
its letterheads and upon all its academic bulletins and publications, and the one
by which it prefers to be known. It is its post office address and its newspaper
date line.
Legally the institution is The Leland Stanford Junior University, since the
Founders, who established it as a memorial to iheir son and only child, so
designated its official title.
For one reason or another people and newspapers outside California have
fixed on the University a name of their own—Leland Stanford University—
which is neither the legal title nor the one that is always used by Stanford
except in legal transactions.
That compromise between the University's two real names does avoid the
cumbersome full title—and incidentally the ambiguity in the word "junior"
that has arisen since the spread of junior colleges and junior high schools- but
it is difficult for Stanford people to understand why "the East" declines to go
the whole way to the simple "Stanford."
Leland Stanford, Jr., himself, the boy in whose memory the University was
founded, was unconsciously responsible for the University's name. It might
have been The Leland DeWitt Stanford University, for he was christened
Leland DeWitt Stanford and bore the name until he was fourteen years old,
in 1882, a year and a half before his death. At that time he declared he wanted
to be known by his father's name. It was his own idea and he had his way.
