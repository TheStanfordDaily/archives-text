Stanford has made available con
siderable areas of its wide' Palo Alto
campus to various enterprises—educa
tional, scientific, or concerned with
community welfare —not directly con
nected with its own educational pro
gram. It leases these lands at a purely
nominal rate.
For example, the Palo Alto Union
District High School, with its large
plant and ample athletic fields and a
grammar school in the Mayfield dis
trict of Palo Alto, and the Palo Alto
Community Center building with ex
tensive playgrounds, are all on Stan
ford land.
University Runs City Hospital

leased for ninety-nine years on terms
that mean no financial profit to Stan
ford. The University operates this
hospital for the city without any
financial obligation.
Near the main group of University
buildings the Carnegie Institution of
Washington has a large, beautifully
equipped laboratory building together
with a number of smaller ones, and
the use of several acres of land for
the carrying on of elaborate experi
ments and investigations in plant
physiology.
