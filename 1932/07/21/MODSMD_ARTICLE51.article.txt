# UNION BUILDINGS ARE OUTGROWTH OF IDEA OF HERBERT HOOVER
## 
### 
One of the most picturesque groups
of buildings at Stanford is the Stan
ford Union, with its three buildings
about an open court with a fountain
in the center, the whole having a
delightful Spanish air. Here is the
center of student activities in the
University, with offices of the various
organizations and student officers.
The Union owes its inception to
Herbert Hoover, who believing that as
the University grew in numbers it
ought not to lose the beneficial close
contacts of the earlier years, as when
it was smaller, himself made the first
subscription and headed an organiza
tion which with contributions from
students, faculty, alumni, and trustees,
erected a building known as the Stan
ford Union.
At the same time Mrs. Hoover
started a movement for a similar
building for women on the opposite
side of the court.
Later an anonymous alumnus con
tributed $100,000 which with a sum
of about the same amount from Uni
versity money was used to build n
much larger building at the back of
the court.
