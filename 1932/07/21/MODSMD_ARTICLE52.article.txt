# HOPKINS STATION BASE FOR STUDY OF MARINE LIFE
## 
### 
The University maintains the Hop
kins Marine Station at Pacific Grove,
on Monterey Bay, a location excep
tionally favorable for the study of
marine life, since there is an abun
dance of marine forms in this par
ticular vicinity. The station functions
as a regular department of the Univer
sity is operated the year around and
attracts a large number of eminent
investigators to its laboratories.
The station was instituted in the
early years of the University through
the gift of Timothy Hopkins, a trustee.
Since that time the first site has been
sold and a situation secured with
greater advantages.
The grounds include seven and a
half acres, consisting of the main por
tion of a little cape known as Cabrillo
Point, with complete control of the
coast line of the point.
There are on it two laboratory
buildings, the Alexander Agassiz Lab
oratory, of reinforced concrete, three
stories in height, with an aquarium
room, five general laboratories and
eleven private and special laboratories,
and the library, besides storage rooms,
photographic dark rooms, and an in
strument room.
The Jacques Loeb laboratory, the
gift of the Rockefeller Foundation, is
also of reinforced concrete and con
siderably larger. It is devoted to ex
perimental biology. The building con
sists of a two-story central portion,
with two flanking wings of one story,
enclosing three sides of a front court,
the over all dimensions being ninety
five by one hundred fifty-two feet.
The eastern half of the first floor con
sists of a general laboratory, three ad
vanced laboratories, four private ad
vanced laboratories, four private rooms,
two store rooms, and an office. The
western half comprises a chemistry
laboratory, two other large rooms lor
special work, a thermostat room, a
balance room, a small store room,
three special apparatus rooms, three
small dark laboratories, a photographic
dark room, and a general office. The
principal laboratories and work rooms
are supplied with sea water, hot and
cold fresh water, gas, direct and al
ternating current, compressed air, and
vacuum outlets. Heating is by steam.
The second story consists of two stack
rooms, a reading room, and two pri
