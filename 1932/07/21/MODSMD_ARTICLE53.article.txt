# STANFORD PROVIDES MEANS FOR STUDENTS TO BORROW TUITION
## 
### 
Stanford has available for scholar
| ships and fellowships a fund of $9,000
as compared with Chicago's $118,000,
Harvard's $307,000, and Yale's $515,000.
Two things make up for this defi
ciency. In the first place Stanford's
; tuition fee of $300 per year is no
greater than Chicago's, and less than
those of Harvard and Yale.
In the second place Stanford has a
| provision whereby students are al
-1 lowed to take out notes, paying for
their tuition after graduation. At the
! present time about $55,000 is being
repaid annually on tuition notes. The
j money received is used for the financ
ing of further notes.
