# MOST STUDENTS IN OUTDOOR SPORT AND COMPETITIVE GAMES
## 
### 
The many acres of level plain on the
Stanford campus have made it possible
to develop easily a great number of
piayfields for men and women, and the
University has fostered a program of
physical education so broad that every
student has an opportunity to partici
pate in some form of competitive out
door sport, according to his interests
and physical qualifications. The indoor
gymnasiums are utilized largely, aside
from showers and lockers, for correc
tive or special exercises; most of the
physical exercise is out in the open
air. Ninety per cent of tfiie men stu
dents engage in some form of competi
tive sport.
ft is a matter of frequent comment
that many of the outstanding athletic
stars at Stanford have been developed
after their matriculation at Stanford,
including a number which have gained
international fame in competition.
All coaches at Stanford are full-time
members of the University faculty, and
a comparison with other universities
shows that Stanford's coaching staff is
one of the smallest among major uni
versities.
Where Football Money Goes
Much is heard about the large sums
taken in from football games and other
varsity athletic contests, with the in
ference that the money is expended
on fanciful trimmings of no great
benefit. Stanford has its big athletic
gate receipts, but it safeguards against
wastefulness. The direction of expendi
tures is in the hands of a Board of
Athletic Control of nine men, with a
general manager of athletics as their
executive. Three of this board are fac
ulty men appointed by the president of
the University; three are alumni se
lected by the Alumni Association, and
three are students elected by the As
sociated Students of the University.
The sanctioning of meets and of par
ticipation in those meets is in the hands
of a faculty committee of five appointed
by the president of the University.
A recent study showed that over a
six-year period receipts from athletic
contests had brought in approximately
$2,500,000 to Stanford and that out of
this sum $1,600,000 was expended for
permanent improvements on the cam
pus. Examples of the expenditures of
this character are $450,000 for a dormi
tory for men; $230,000 for a new gym
nasium for women which was badly
needed and which is one of the best
adapted buildings for its purpose in the
country; $75,000 for a building to house
the Department of Physical Education.
Other equipment thus paid for are the
football and track stadium, seating
more than 90,000, a varsity baseball dia
mond and a variety of supplementary
diamonds as well as many football
fields, tennis courts, and playgrounds
for other sports. Stanford has three
swimming pools, two track and field
grounds, two polo fields for men, and
a swimming pool and a variety of fields
for hockey, basketball, archery, and
so xi for women.
Developing Health Habits
Through a novel engineering plan
devised by Professor Charles B. Wing
of its faculty, taking advantage of ter
rain and soil formation, Stanford a
number of years ago erected a football
stadium seating more than 70,000 for
only about two hundred thousand dol
lars, as compared with the millions
other universities found it necessary
to spend, although subsequent enlarge
ments and beautification have consider
ably increased the original Stanford
stadium cost.
Recently an eighteen-hole golf course
has been developed at a cost of
$160,000, which is declared to be one
of the most beautiful and sportiest
links in ihe country. This course and
the clubhouse will be financed in part
through fees, which have been made
low for members of the University.
The golf course as well as the tennis
courts fit peculiarly well into the Uni
versity physical education plan, which
is to inculcate habits of regular recrea
tional health habits which students will
retain after they leave college.

Where Football Money Goes
Much is heard about the large sums
taken in from football games and other
varsity athletic contests, with the in
ference that the money is expended
on fanciful trimmings of no great
benefit. Stanford has its big athletic
gate receipts, but it safeguards against
wastefulness. The direction of expendi
tures is in the hands of a Board of
Athletic Control of nine men, with a
general manager of athletics as their
executive. Three of this board are fac
ulty men appointed by the president of
the University; three are alumni se
lected by the Alumni Association, and
three are students elected by the As
sociated Students of the University.
The sanctioning of meets and of par
ticipation in those meets is in the hands
of a faculty committee of five appointed
by the president of the University.
A recent study showed that over a
six-year period receipts from athletic
contests had brought in approximately
$2,500,000 to Stanford and that out of
this sum $1,600,000 was expended for
permanent improvements on the cam
pus. Examples of the expenditures of
this character are $450,000 for a dormi
tory for men; $230,000 for a new gym
nasium for women which was badly
needed and which is one of the best
adapted buildings for its purpose in the
country; $75,000 for a building to house
the Department of Physical Education.
Other equipment thus paid for are the
football and track stadium, seating
more than 90,000, a varsity baseball dia
mond and a variety of supplementary
diamonds as well as many football
fields, tennis courts, and playgrounds
for other sports. Stanford has three
swimming pools, two track and field
grounds, two polo fields for men, and
a swimming pool and a variety of fields
for hockey, basketball, archery, and
so xi for women.
Developing Health Habits
Through a novel engineering plan
devised by Professor Charles B. Wing
of its faculty, taking advantage of ter
rain and soil formation, Stanford a
number of years ago erected a football
stadium seating more than 70,000 for
only about two hundred thousand dol
lars, as compared with the millions
other universities found it necessary
to spend, although subsequent enlarge
ments and beautification have consider
ably increased the original Stanford
stadium cost.
Recently an eighteen-hole golf course
has been developed at a cost of
$160,000, which is declared to be one
of the most beautiful and sportiest
links in ihe country. This course and
the clubhouse will be financed in part
through fees, which have been made
low for members of the University.
The golf course as well as the tennis
courts fit peculiarly well into the Uni
versity physical education plan, which
is to inculcate habits of regular recrea
tional health habits which students will
retain after they leave college.
The many acres of level plain on the
Stanford campus have made it possible
to develop easily a great number of
piayfields for men and women, and the
University has fostered a program of
physical education so broad that every
student has an opportunity to partici
pate in some form of competitive out
door sport, according to his interests
and physical qualifications. The indoor
gymnasiums are utilized largely, aside
from showers and lockers, for correc
tive or special exercises; most of the
physical exercise is out in the open
air. Ninety per cent of tfiie men stu
dents engage in some form of competi
tive sport.
ft is a matter of frequent comment
that many of the outstanding athletic
stars at Stanford have been developed
after their matriculation at Stanford,
including a number which have gained
international fame in competition.
All coaches at Stanford are full-time
members of the University faculty, and
a comparison with other universities
shows that Stanford's coaching staff is
one of the smallest among major uni
versities.
