# Graduates Lay Bronze Plates In Arcade Of Quadrangle
## 
### 
Every class graduating from Stan
ford replaces one of the concrete blocks
in the pavement, of the arcade around
the Inner Quad with a bronze plate
beneath which are records of the class
and current college publications.
The custom was begun by the Class
of 189(5, of which President Wilbur was
a member.
The plates are cast in the University
foundry.
It will be centuries before they en
circle the Quad and reach the starting
point again.
