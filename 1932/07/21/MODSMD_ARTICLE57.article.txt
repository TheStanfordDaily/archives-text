# RESEARCH IN MANY LINES SUPPORTED BY LARGE GIFTS
## Laboratories And Special Studies Carry On Work 
### 
With (he development of specialized I
and graduate work under outstanding '
experts and leaders Stanford has in
! recent years been the recipient of a j
j number of notable experimental lab
' oratories and of funds from educational
| foundations for the prosecution of ex
pert studies in the fields of physical
and social sciences.
Two of these noteworthy features
are the direct outgrowth of the World
War and of the relief work in that
war headed by Herbert Hoover, a
graduate of Stanford in the first class
i that spent four years at Stanford and
1 now a member of the Board of Trus
. tees. These are the Hoover War Li
-1 brary and the Food Research lnsti
j tute.
Hoover War Library Unique
The Hoover War Library is a col
i lection of books concerning the World
! War and of the causes and effects of
I war and of official books and docu
ments, pamphlets, and private papers
gathered from every nation, and con
| stantly being added to. It is unequalled
| anywhere else in the world as a
| reservoir of information about the
World War and to it come scholars
from all parts of the world for special
j studies. Some of its material is of a
I kind that disappeared soon after the
conclusion of the events which gave
rise to it; some is unique, as the pri
vate papers of men who took leading
I parts in the events touched on; some
j even of such a confidential nature that
1 pledges have been given that it will
j not be made public for certain num
bers of years. With the passing of
years, the Hoover -War Library will
become the authentic source of much
| of the information from which an ac
tual and authentic history of the
; World War can be written.
Institute Studies Food Supplies
j The Food Research Institute was an
j outgrowth of the realization forced on
th>j world by the war that almost
| nothing was known about the world's
| food resources or capabilities or the
I mass feeding of whole populations. As
| a result the Carnegie Corporation ade
i quately financed the establishment and
: conduct of this institute at Stanford
i for a period of ten years to make
! careful studies of the production, dis
tribution and consumption of food,
from all aspects. Recently the Car
i negie Corporation made a supple
mentary gift of $750,000 to the Uni
versity endowment and Stanford,
which has constituted the Food Re
search Institute from the beginning
as an integral department of the Uni
' versity in research and instruction,
j will continue to maintain it. The in
' stitute has carried on wide studies,
1 especially with regard to wheat and
; food fats, and has published many
! bulletins.
Saves Millions For Industry
In recognition of the services to the
i electrical industry rendered by Pro
j fessor Harris J. Ryan, head of the
; department of electrical engineering in
the University, who it is estimated
! has saved millions of dollars to elec
j trical power companies through the
j results of his investigations which he
j has made freely available, these com
panies a number of years ago aided in
j erecting the Harris J. Ryan Labora
tory for the study of high-voltage
electrical transmission, representing an
investment of $400,000. Here studies
are being prosecuted, in an immense
building that can be made absolutely
light proof and over an experimental
power line running a quarter of a
mile across open country that are of
fundamental importance to the growth
and prosperity of the West, where
i electrical energy generated in the
! mountains must be carried long dis
j tances to the coast.
Air Tunnel Tests Planes
The Daniel Guggenheim Aeronautic
! Laboratory, equipped and supported
jby a gift of $180,000, with its great
I wind tunnel is carrying on significant
investigations on propellers and plane
1 foils, and other details of airplane de

To the School of Social Sciences the
Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund a
| number of years ago made a grant of
1 $250,000 to aid scholarly work in the
! social sciences, and the Rockefeller
1 Foundation has recently supplemented
that with another grant of $200,000.
