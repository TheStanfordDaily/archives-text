# STANFORD PRESS WELL â€“ EQUIPPED
## Grew Out Of Enterprise Of Working Student 
### 
The Stanford University Press
(which prints this newspaper) is
notable among the university presses
of the country in that it is a complete
publishing house with a fully equipped
manufacturing plant, th;it prints, binds,
and distributes books which hold their
own among the best produced in the
country. It has been represented in
the "Fifty Books of the Year'' exhibit
of the American Institute of Graphic
Arts, and volumes by Stanford faculty
men, published through the University
Press, have been numbered among the
"Forty Notable American Books" se
lected by the American Library Asso
ciation for the League of Nations, the
"College Presidents Professional Li
brary" exhibit selected by the Asso
ciation of American Colleges, and
other such groups of notable volumes.
Grew From a Student's Enterprise
This exceptionally comprehensive
university press and publishing house
is the outgrowth of the enterprise of
a single self-supporting student in the
first years of the University. J. A.
Quelle was that man, and having
learned the printing trade, he set up
a little press on the campus to help
himself in working his way through
college. The faculty men and depart
ment heads turned over to him letter
heads and other minor printing jobs.
The students engaged him to print
their daily newspaper (which is this
paper) and the University authorities
managed to find space for him in
various buildings as his work and
equipment expanded.
Then, in 1917, the University bought
Quelle out, his business by this time
having grown into a considerable
manufacturing plant, and erected a
simple building to house it. more ade
quately.
Becomes a Publishing House
The University Press remained
merely a manufacturing plant until
1925, when with the appointment of
Professor William Hawley Davis as
editor and David Lamson, a graduate
of the University, as .sales manager, it
launched out as a publishing house.
Its business swelled, it did good work,
and it outgrew its quarters, especially
when manuscripts began to come in
from other universities, as they did
from nearly all the chief Pacific Coast
institutions and from others farther
away.
In 1929, therefore, a fifty-thousand
dollar shop building, with 12,000
square feet of working space, modern
and convenient in every way, well
lighted and comfortable for the sixty
persons employed by the Press, was
completed.
Has To Pay Its Way
One remarkable thing about the
Stanford University Press, which nuw
has about 235 titles on its list, is that
from the time the University took it
over it has been expected to pay its
own way and finance its growth. It
hasn't always done this, for expenses
were heavy in proportion to income,
especially in the first years, and it
publishes many scholarly books for
which there is necessarily no demand
for large numbers of copies, but has,
nevertheless, through the years of its
existence, consistently lifted itself by
its own bootstraps, which is no easy
job for a university press and pub
i lishing house.

launched out as a publishing house.
Its business swelled, it did good work,
and it outgrew its quarters, especially
when manuscripts began to come in
from other universities, as they did
from nearly all the chief Pacific Coast
institutions and from others farther
away.
In 1929, therefore, a fifty-thousand

Has To Pay Its Way
One remarkable thing about the
Stanford University Press, which nuw
has about 235 titles on its list, is that
from the time the University took it
over it has been expected to pay its
own way and finance its growth. It
hasn't always done this, for expenses
were heavy in proportion to income,
especially in the first years, and it
publishes many scholarly books for
which there is necessarily no demand
for large numbers of copies, but has,
nevertheless, through the years of its
existence, consistently lifted itself by
its own bootstraps, which is no easy
job for a university press and pub
i lishing house.
The Stanford University Press
(which prints this newspaper) is
notable among the university presses
of the country in that it is a complete
publishing house with a fully equipped
manufacturing plant, th;it prints, binds,
and distributes books which hold their
own among the best produced in the
country. It has been represented in
the "Fifty Books of the Year'' exhibit
of the American Institute of Graphic
Arts, and volumes by Stanford faculty
men, published through the University
Press, have been numbered among the
"Forty Notable American Books" se

"College Presidents Professional Li

Grew From a Student's Enterprise
This exceptionally comprehensive
university press and publishing house
is the outgrowth of the enterprise of
a single self-supporting student in the
first years of the University. J. A.
Quelle was that man, and having
learned the printing trade, he set up
a little press on the campus to help
himself in working his way through
college. The faculty men and depart
ment heads turned over to him letter
heads and other minor printing jobs.
The students engaged him to print
their daily newspaper (which is this
paper) and the University authorities
managed to find space for him in
various buildings as his work and
equipment expanded.
Then, in 1917, the University bought
Quelle out, his business by this time
having grown into a considerable
manufacturing plant, and erected a
simple building to house it. more ade
quately.
Becomes a Publishing House
The University Press remained
merely a manufacturing plant until
1925, when with the appointment of
Professor William Hawley Davis as
editor and David Lamson, a graduate
of the University, as .sales manager, it
launched out as a publishing house.
