# BRIGHT FRESHMEN TO BE GIVEN CHANCE AT INDEPENDENT STUDY
## 
### 
In order to release capable and
energetic students from lh<> routine of
classroom stints and to free excep
tional students from the danger of
falling into habits of merely keeping
pace with the less able, Stanford sev
eral years ago devised what it called
the Independent Study Plan, by which
students of junior standing who have
made high records may, if they choose,
launch upon a new way of going at
their work, cither as a whole or in
! part, by carrying on their studies by
! themselves, with the advcie of pro
j fessors with whom they consult, in
! stead of by attending regular classes.
Puts Students Oa Their Own
With students who were really in
i earnest the plan proved a success, and
now a movement is being undertaken
to see whether a similar method of
study may successfully be prosecuted
by freshmen and sophomores.
To aid in the experiment, the Gen
oral Education Board has made a grant
of $100,000 to Stanford for a period of
five years. This will enable the Uni
versity to add to the teaching staff for
this purpose.
The experiment has been tried out
during the past school year. One-fifth
of the freshmen in a course known as
Citizenship, which is required of all
first-year students, were given an op
portunity to be released from class at
! tendance and carry on their studies by
I themselves under the guidance of spe
cial instructors. Advanced students in
several of the sophomore courses in
economics, English, history, and so
' ciology were also selected for this ex
; periment.
Will Follow Students Through
j It is proposed, then, to follow these
students through their later years in
I the University, giving them special
attention under the Independent Study
j Plan.
The attempt to call out the best that
is in capable students has occupied
, the thought of college teachers for
! years. Stanford made enough progress
i with its own experimental device to
j win this support from the General
' Education Board in driving it through
to a conclusion that would not have
been possible with the University's
own funds alone.
