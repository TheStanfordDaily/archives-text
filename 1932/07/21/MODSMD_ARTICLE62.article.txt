# MARIVAUX PLAY WELL RECEIVED
## 
### 
Playing to an interested audience,
the Cornish Players Touring Group
presented "Love and Chance," by
Marivaux, in the Assembly Hall Tues
day evening. The play, representative
of the 18th century period, is a light
comedy, defending entirely upon the
plot and dialogue.

Marivaux uses the ok! idea of mis
taken identhy to produce his humor
ous situations. Two lovers, about to
meet for the first time, disguise them
selves; Sylvia as her maid, and Dorante
as his valet, in order to study each
other. Sylvia's father and brother watch
the love affairs that ensue between the
bogus gallant and mistress, and the
disguised valet and maid, commenting
upon them from the forestage.
The audience laughs as much at the
foolery of servants, attempting love
making in what they suppose to be
the manner of their betters, as they
do at .the consternation of Sylvia and
Dorante, who suppose themselves to
be in love with persons below their
birth and rank. After Dorante reveals
himself to Sylvia, the interest centers
in her efforts to capture him without
revealing her identity. She finally suc
ceeds, and, as in all of Marivaux's
plays, love is triumphant over posi
tion and breeding.
Not hilariously funny, the play kept
the audience chuckling from beginning
to end. Credit sftould be given Director
John Mercier and the actors for so
ably presenting the subtle wit of Mari
vaux, so much of which depends upon
a mere gesture or accent.
