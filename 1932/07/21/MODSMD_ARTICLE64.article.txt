# STANFORD MEN TO MEET HUNGARY IN SHRINER PROGRAM
## Gardner, Hirsch, And Rogers Will Swim Against Invading Stars 
### 
Combining the best available ma
terial from both Stanford and the j
Olympic Club, the Pacific Association I
second team will play Hungary'.* world
champion water polo team as a part |
of the Shrine program to be held at
Fleishhacker pool Sunday.
The Pacific Association first team, |
with four Stanford men on it, will be j
in Los Angeles on that dale trying out j
for the American Olympic team.
The chief event in the swimming j
will be the clash between John Gard- j
ner of Stanford and Stephen Barany j
of Hungary. Barany holds the Euro
pean championship and the European
record in the 100-meter free-style, and !
he is picked by Norton Thornton,
Stanford swimming coach, to win that
event in the Olympics.
Bill Rogers of Stanford and Ralph
Hargraves of the Olympic Club will !
race the Hungarians in the 100-meter
backstroke.
In the 400-meter relay Dick Hirsch
and John Gardner of Stanford will
combine with Gilman and Friedlander
of the Olympic Club, in what should
promise to be the closest event of the
meet.
The water polo team has not been
definitely picked, but Dick Hirsch,
Harold Juda, Ken Avery, and Larry j
Harris should compose Stanford's con- j
tribution. The rest of the team will j
probably be made up of Olympic Club
players.
