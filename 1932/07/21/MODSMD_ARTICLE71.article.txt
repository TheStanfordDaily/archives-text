# L.A.A.C. FAVORITE FOR WATER POLO
## Pinal Olymyic Tryouts To Be Held At Pasadena 
### 
With three Stanford and two ex-
Stanford men on one team and live
ex-Stanford men on another, the final
tryouts at Pasadena next Sunday to
determine the American Olympic
water polo team will tye a case of In
dian meeting Indian.
The L.A.A.C. team, picked by Nor
ton Thornton, Stanford swimming and
water polo coach, as the probable win
ner, has among its members Reggie
Harrison, ex-St:mford captain and a
member of the 1928 Olympics team;
Cal Strong, another ex-Stanford cap
tain and a former National Intercolle
giate champion; Dutch McAllister, for
mer Stanford star guard; Burke Knapp,
this year's goal guard and captain-elect
of next year's team; and Wally O'Con
nor, Stanford's greatest forward and
high-point man on the American
Olympic team in both 1924 and 1928.
The Pacific Association, a combina
tion of Stanford and the Olympic Club,
contains just as many stars, but they
lack the teamwork of the L.A.A.C.
squad. Frank Booth and Ted Wiget,
who recently won places on the Olym
pic relay team, 'and Austin Clapp,
member of the 1928 Olympics, are the
three Stanford men who will form the
forward wall. Elmer Colett, former goal
guard, and Whitey Burns, former cap
tain, are the other Stanford members
of the team.
These two teams will face stiff com
petition from the East. The Illinois
A.C., national champions, and the New
York A.C., runners-up, will be on
hand. But Thornton picks the L.A.A.C.
to come in first, the Pacific Association
second, and the I.A.C. third.
A United States team has never won
better than third place in an Olympic
water polo contest.
Hungary, with its 1928 Olympic team
practically intact, is still the favorite.
Thornton picks the United States sec
ond, with England, France, and Ger
many following in about that order.
