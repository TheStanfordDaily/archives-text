# HITCH-HIKER TELLS HER EXPERIENCES ON PACIEIC COAST
## Dutch Girl Visits Stanford Friends On Way To Vancouver, B.C. 
### Eleanora Bosworth 
The sun beats down on a California
highway. Cars flash by, headed for a
nearby town. An attractive girl of 21,
stocky and dark, smiles cheerfully at
the motorists and asks pleasantly,
"Going up?"
A car stops abruptly. She climbs in,
and the machine speeds away.
To Galinka Ehrenfest, hitch-hiker
from Leiden, Holland, this method of
transportation is safe, economical, and
"thrilling." Last week she arrived on
the Stanford campus, where she was
Ihe guest of Professor and Mrs. Kurt
Lewin, friends of her father, who is
a physicist at the University of Ley
den. »
Just two years ago Galinka came
to the United States to study Ameri
can educational facilities lor children.
From St. Louis, where she visited an
uncle, she came by train, to California.
Then she decided to see the West as
a hitch-hiker.
Has Recipe For Safety
Between jaunts she works in res
taurants or private homes. Only a
few weeks ago she was picking apri
cots on a ranch near San Jose.
"Most of the pick-ups on the high
way come from insurance agents,"
she says. "They're interested in your
welfare, and also in their own sales
manship—all you Americans are."
"Safe? Certainly it's safe. I tell the
curious I have four big brothers, six
uncles, a father, and a cowboy
sweetheart waiting for me in the next
town. They act like perfect gentle
men."
"What city impressed me the most?
Los Angeles, I should say. It is a
city without a heart. One must be
amused to like it. Decrepit wooden
houses, new concrete buildings, park
ing spaces, hot-dog stands, and ex
travagant fashion displays—all in one
mad conglomeration—that is Los An
geles."
American Libraries Interest Her
American public libraries were of
especial interest to Galinka. "You
should be proud of them. They are
yours. They are kept by your taxes
and belong to you," she maintains.
While in Arizona the girl visited a
ranch near Phoenix. "The hostess told
me she lived very simply, and that
she did her own cooking. Yes, they
baked cakes they couldn't eat, but the
chef and the kitchen servants really
cooked the meals. They had a garden,
too, but they had a trained man in
charge of the lawns. Do Americans
call that 'living simply'? Not at all.
"The next day I visited one of
those Mexican gardeners. The family
was large, lived in an adobe hut, and
did its own cooking outside. Their
friends picked cotton, or worked in
the oil fields for little pay.
"And my hostess said she lived
simply! In that contrast I wonder
about your democracy, with rich and
poor living side by side, but both
living 'simply' and unable to see the
humor of their statement.
Class System More Apparent Here
"We hear in Europe that every
American home has all modern con
veniences. It is not so. Perhaps a
certain stratum of the middle-class
has them, but that is all. Your poor
are as wretched as ours, and the class
system is more apparent in your
'democracy.'
"We idealize America in Europe,
because of its educational facilities,
and its government. They are ideal
. . . . on paper. Why don't your col
lege students idealize them in reality?"
After her Stanford stop, Galinka
left for San Francisco, where she
planned to visit the art colony on
Telegraph liill. From there she in
tends to "bum" her way, up to Van
couver, where she hopes to be able to
spend some time on coast fishing
smacks, learning al labout the salmon
and other piscatorial industries.
