Those students who wished to work
for room and board have apparently
made one grand rush to the appoint
ments service, for Mrs, Irene Spenner,
who is in charge, reports that almost
all of these vacancies have been filled.
However, students wishing to work
for room, or for board only, have been
unequally distributed as to number.
There has been a demand for the jobs
that guarantee board, but the room
working positions did not receive such
a response.
