# Ben Leaves To Join U.S. Team
## Sinus and Cold Are Cured; in Best of Condition 
### 
Ben Eastman, American 400 meter
ace, took the Sunset Limited for Los
Angeles and the Olympic Games last
night. There he will join Here La-
Borde, discus thrower, Bill Miller, pole
vaulter, and Nellie Gray, shot putter,
his teammates of the 1932 collegiate
season, who also earned berths on
Uncle Sam's team. These athletes will
live at the Olympic village, where they
will train for the games.
Ben's cold and sinus trouble seem to
have departed, so that he should be in
the best of condition, as he will need

! to be, competing in the fast company of \
I Carr, Stoneley, Rumpling, and Gordon, j
i Stoneley, British "mystery-man," who !
' won the English trials, placing first over i
! Hampson and Rampling, looks like the |
I best foreign chance in this event.
"Ben Eastman is looking better now
| than at any time since the first of the ;
j season," remarked Harry Maloney, di- i
I rector of minor sports and ardent track >
I follower, yesterday. Maloney is con- j
j fident that Eastman will profit from I
| "underdog" psychology and win his
j race in the Olympics.
j Maloney leaves today for Los An
j geles to take charge of the electric tim- j
I ing device. This apparatus is the same
j used at the American team tryout fi
i nals in the Stanford Stadium.
