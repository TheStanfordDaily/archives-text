fluence will also be discussed.
To Describe Modern Life
In the latter part of his lecture he
will discuss the three leading modes of
life characteristic of the region, and
explain the results of the penetration
of modern civilization during the past
50 years which has so radically dis
i integrated and transformed the native
j habits and customs.
Blanchard, Agrega de l'Universitc
de France, 1900, received his degree of
Docteur es Lettres from the University
of Lille in 1906. Since that time he has
been an exchange professor at Har

Geography Important
In France geography is much more
of a cultural subject than it is in
America. There it is classed with the
humanities, and is taught in the fac
ulty of arts and letters. Much has
been done to develop, to make more
exact, and to clarify geography, which
is a science of relationships and ex
planations. Geography makes the syn
thesis, connecting divergent sorts of
informations, and explaining human
| occupations in the light of all these
j conditions.
The greatest centers of influence in
j the development of modern French
| geography are the Sorbonne and the
I University of Grenoble, in which lat
ter place Blanchard has developed a
j school of urban geography. This is a
I specialized branch of the new French
j school of regional geography.
Blanchard is the author of numerous
' books and articles, among which are
; "Flanders," "Western Asia," '"French
Alps," and "Urban Geography."
