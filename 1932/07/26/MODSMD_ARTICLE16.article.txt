The well-rounded, worthwhile life
does not consist in having things, but
in being something, said the Rev.
Charles R. Brown, dean of the Divinity
School, emeritus, of Yale University,
in his sermon in the Memorial Church
Sunday morning.
The accumulation of a wealth of
"things" too often results in spiritual
poverty, according to Dr. Brown. He
stressed the need of becoming a real
person, with depth of character, rather
than devoting energies to collecting a
great mass of tangible goods.
