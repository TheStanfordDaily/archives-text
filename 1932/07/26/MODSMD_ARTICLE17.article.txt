# Coming German Elections To Decide Nation's Future
## 
### 
"The coming German national elec-
I tions to the Reich, to be held July 31,
, will decide the political, .social, and
| economic future of the German Re
i public," according to Dr. Ralph Has
| well Lutz, professor of history and
chairman of the directors of the Hoo
| ver War Library. Dr. Lutz' book, "The
j Fall of the German Empire," will be
! published in October by the Stanford
| University Press.
In summarizing the present situation
i in Prussia, Dr. Lutz explained that the
election of April 24, which defeated
the Socialist, Center, and State par
ties, was indecisive because the new
majority parties were unable to com
! bine. The present dictatorship of Von
i Papen is an outgrowth of the elections,
i and is an attempt to establish order
and to organize the Prussian parties
j which have control over three-fifths of
I the German Reich, and which can and

will take over the government. The
control over the Prussian police force
is inadequate, and the dictatorship is
I necessary until the elections are over.
"The Hoover moratorium and (he
Lausanne conference undoubtedly im
proved the German situation," says Dr.
i Lutz, "but the fate of (he Republic is
!to be decided on July 31. If the Na
i tional Socialists, under Hitler, gain
i control of the Reich and establish a
1 majority, there will be a change in the
j constitution. This fact vitally affects
j many American interests because of
j the extensive investments held in Ger
! many."
"It is hardly probable that Germany
! will ever withdraw from the League
j of Nations," averred Dr. Lutz in reply
i to a question as to the possibility that
j the German demands at the Geneva
Disarmament Conference might be re-
I fused.
