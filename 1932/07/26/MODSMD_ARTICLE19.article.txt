# MOLINARI LEADS SUNDAY CONCERT
## Final Appearance of Italian Conductor Draws Crowd 
### Will Williams 
Bernardino Molinari revealed him
self as a master of imaginative themes,
as well as the vivid and dramatic maes
tro who is so well known to Peninsula
music lovers, in his final concert Sun
day at the Woodland Theatre in Hills
borough.
The "Symphony in G Major" by
Franz Joseph Haydn was ofTered as
the opening number, and Molinari
handled his orchestra in a manner quite
in keeping with the exquisite tender
ness of Ihe piece.
Miss Clark is Soloist
Tschaikowsky's "Andante Cantabile"
from Siring Quartet, Opus 11, a favor
ite concert number, was presented with
sympathy, fully bringing out the fine
melancholy of the tragic movement.
Molinari let the piece speak for itself
and submerged his personality to give
full force to the subtle meaning.
The sheer beauty of "Scherzo" from
"A Midsummer Night's Dream," by
Felix Mendelssohn, was presented with
its remarkably fine imagery. Tliere
was all the impishness and gayety of
a true fairyland, while Molinari's little
touch of mockery at the finish stamped
the piece in one's memory.
Miss Agnes Clark, soloist at the pi
ano, blended her playing well with the
orchestral theme of Cesar Franck's
"Symphonic Variations" for piano and
orchestra, which was carried through
to a superb finish.
Wagner's Numbers Played
The concluding two numbers, selec
tions from Wagner, were the highlights
of the program. The prelude to "Lo
hengrin," in which is shown a vision
of the Holy Grail, was remarkably line.
The soft introductory passages were
skilfully handled and built up to a
sustained height, finally breaking off
into an anticlimax of great beauty and
force.
The final offering, overture to "Tann
hauser," began with quiet, reflective
introductory movements and suddenly
broke out in color and drama, present
ing the Italian conductor in his ele
ment. He drew the music from his men
with a force and vividness that left no
doubt that half the beauty of the pro
gram was in Molinari.
Sunday, August 7, the final Wood
land Concert will be given, with Fred
erick Stock of the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra as guest conductor.
