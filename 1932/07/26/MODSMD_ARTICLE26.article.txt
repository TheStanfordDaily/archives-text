# OUR "INTERCOLLEGIATE" CHAMPIONS
## 
### 
OimÂ» which the United Slates Olympic team Irials
showed was lliaf a mail is not ail "intercollegiate" champion
jnst hecausc lie won an event in the 1.C.1-A. track and field
meet.
After the Berkeley meet, Wvkoff and Kicscl were crowned
IM2 intercollegiate sprint champions. After the Olympic meet,
one wonders where Metcalfe and Toppino til into that picture.
And how such other college semi-finalists as Johnson, Bennett,
and Wavbright can he completely overlooked.
And how far hack were Record and Fates, the 1.C.4-A. hur
dling champions, behind such college stars as Keller, Saling,
Black, ('.rant, Hardin, Sentman, Beatty, and Blanchard in the
tryouts? 9
Carr and Eastman, of course, are untouchable in the 110,
and ."Blazing Ben" could take the 880, but with Hornsboestel to
push him, il might be a more interesting race.
The list of college stars who were not in Ihe "intercolle
giates' can he continued. Brocksmith, Cunningham, Dawson,
Prilehard, Wills, Otiey, (Chamberlain, and Kearns in the dis
tances; Bartlett, Purvis, Rinehart, and Williams in the jave
lin; Gordon, Redd, Brooks, Nelson, Marly, George and Sidney
Bowman, and Romero in the jumps; Zimmerman and Beecher
in Ihe pole vault; and Rhea, Munn, and Mocller in the weights.
And what about I.S. C. winning the team championship,
with Stanford as runner-up? Apparently either Ohio Stale or
Indiana could have entered teams that might shove both of
these first schools clear out of the money.
What a meet we could have every year if a real intercolle
giate match were held! There would he Ihe same record-break
ing performances, startling upsets, and dark horses as we had
in the Olympic trvouts 10 days ago. And judging from the
crowd that came to Stanford, the gate receipts of such a meet,
if held in or near a large city, should meet expenses.
Best of all, the university that won the meet, and the indi
viduals who won their events, could really he called "inter
collegia le" champions.
