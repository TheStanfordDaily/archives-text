# PALO ALTO'S ISLAND
## 
### 
Work on I lie Stanford side of the "island" traflic plan has
finally been finished. Unfortunately, completion of the Uni
versity's part has not removed the biggest source of confusion,
delay, and waste â€”the jog going into town.
This will he eliminated only when Palo Alto builds a cor
responding island. The city council approved the plan a long
lime ago, and the Standard and Shell Oil oflicials agreed to pay
their leases in advance, in order to provide the necessary funds
lor the work, also a long time ago. The Hoard of Works now
seems to be playing a game with these companies, trying to see
which will start first. So tar, both sides arc about even.
An observer might conclude that Palo Alto is waiting until
October, so that there will be plenty of trallie to tie up, instead
of going ahead now and getting the job done before the autumn
quarter starts. Perhaps Mayor Thomas, who is also Professor
Thomas of Stanford, can, with the aid of the other faculty men
on llie city council, hurry the project along a little. It would
be a good way to serve both university and community in
terests.
