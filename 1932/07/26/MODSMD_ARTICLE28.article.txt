# DID YOU MISS "PARADE"?

Maine il on a low summer registration, lack of publicity or
a dearth of student interest, the fact remains that too many
empty seats spoiled "Parade." Our first major dramatic pro
duction of the quarter played to a poor house.
Stanford productions are of a caliber deserving far better
sludent-bodv support. In spite of an antiquated theatre and
inadequate equipment, our productions have reached such a
stage of development as to draw wide comment and praise.
Not only has Stanford staged many worthy productions but
the. list of men and women who have trod the boards in the
assembly hall have gone forth to rise in their work and are to
be found connected with the stage from California to London,
while some have toured the world under the banner of the
American theatre.

To mention only a few, Maud Howell, "Ml, found her work
â€¢is stage manager for George Xrliss; Maxwell Anderson wrote
"W'lial Price Glory?" "Saturday's Children," and "Elizabeth
the Queen"; William Thornton, '27, held one of the leads with
Walter Hampden in "Cyrano de Hcrgerac." Many graduates
are reported to he doing excellent work with the little theatre
in colleges and schools over the country.
Jini 11 on a tradition of excellence, Stanford dramatics are
worthy of heller student support.
"Alison's House," lo he presented next month under the
direction of Frederick Stover, is the second play of the quarter,
and worthy of the cast assembled here this summer. Staged by
Eva Le Gallienne, the play scored a smashing hit on Hroadway
last year.
On our own stage Ibis production promises lo be outstand
ing, and deserving of a larger audience than turned out lo see.
"Parade."

Welcome, Nobles! It's easy to spot a Shriller in San Fran
cisco now. They all shiver in the fog and wear while flannels.
