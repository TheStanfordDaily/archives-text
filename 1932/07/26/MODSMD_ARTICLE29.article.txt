The ancient slave market, around which centered the business life of the early Greeks and Romans, found its
counterpart in the Los Angeles Plaza. But instead of slaves, 13 free men and women, Americans for the most part, down
on their luck and unable to find employment, auctioned themselves off to the highest bidder for their services. Col.
Louis Byrens, who conducted a similar auction years :igo in Boston for returned soldiers, immediately after the war,
presided over the strange ceremony.
