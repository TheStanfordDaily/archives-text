SAN FRANCISCO, at the BAL TABA
RIN
Sporting that appealingly smooth
style of rhythmic "Lombardo" melody,
Carol Lofner and his Brunswick re
cording orchestra opened last week.
Lofner, after intriguing us with this
new aggregation when he was fea
tured at the Encina informal this
spring, is back in the Foggy City fresh
from a successful tour with new tunes
and fancy arrangements.
Little Muzzy Marcellino, popular
with Stanfordites even back .when he
and Phil Harris yodeled nightly in the
"Frantic," continues to shine in front
of the "mike" 'on the vocals, sharing
honors with A1 Teeberg of the big bass
voice.
Both boys get a great hand and their
own unique arrangement of "Rockin'
Chair" practically brings down the
house. This orchestra has harmony,
and in ample quantities, with a plain
tive rhythm that invites one to get out
there on the floor and dance.
A feature, and a very novel one, is
the attraction offered in the Bal Taba
rin floor show, given three times every
evening. Thi'ee clever revues are pre
sented during the evening. To one
used to hotel dancing, the thing is
quite interesting and entertaining, as
well as amusing.

THIRTY YEARS IN THE GOLDEN
NORTH, by Jan Welz J. Macmillan,
1932. $2.50
Jules Verne's phrase, "the faithful
narrative of an incredible adventure,"
is an apt description of Jan Welzl's
colorful tale, for this is one of the
strangest stories imaginable of a man
who, seized by wanderlust, worked
his way north to the Arctic regions,
where he endured hunger, loneliness,
and many dangers, but made a living
and became a chief among the Eski
mos, white traders, and gold diggers.
Welzl, a Czech by birth, a locksmith
by trade, decided to seek his fortune
in the Far North, traveled by wagon
across the wilds of Siberia, then on a
whaling ship up to the Arctic Circle.
In his book he tells the story of his
arduous journey, and of how he be
came a successful trader, with head
quarters in a commodious cave on the
rocky coast of New Siberia, an island
in the Arctic ocean, where he has now
lived for over thirty years.

THE ROAD TO CIBOLA, by Carl
Sauer. University of California
Press, 1932
The first great international high
way on the North American continent,
traced out by the feet of Spanish ex
plorers and conquistadores four cen
turies ago, has just been trapped and
described by Professor Carl Sauer of
the University of California Depart
ment of Geography.
In a booklet entitled "The Road to
Cibola," published by the University
Press as the third of a series on Ibero-
Americana, Professor Sauer brings to
gether for the first time data on the
routes of such historically famous men
as Francisco Cortes, Nuno de Guzman,
Diego de Guzman, Cabeza de Vaca,
Fray Marcos, Coronado, and Ibarra.
By careful restudy of such diaries
and reports as the early explorers
have left, followed by an actual recon
naissance of the country, Professor
Sauer was able to correct many errors
of interpretation in present histories of
this period. For one thing, he was led
to the conclusion that Cabeza de Vaca
lather than Fray Marcos was the first
white man to enter the territory now
included within the states of Arizona
and New Mexico.
Concerning this early highway used
so extensively between 1524 and 15R5
by the Spaniards named Professor
Sauer says: "The land passage through
Northwestern New Spain was mostly

by one great arterial highway. From
the densely peopled lands of Central
Mexico a road led by way of the
coastal lowlands of the Mexican
Northwest to the northern land of the
Pueblo Indians, and at the last, to
California. I call it the Road to Cibola,
since the search for the legendary
seven citics of Cibola was the main
reason for its opening by the Span
iards."

OUR WONDERLAND OF BUREAU
CRACY. by James M. Beck. Mac- ;
millan, 1932. $3.00
"Have the American people created i
a Frankenstein of bureaucracy, from
which escape is impossible?" asks j
James M. Beck in this book. Mr. Beck. ;
formerly solicitor general of the Uni- j
ted States, and now representative '
from Pennsylvania, demands a com- j
plete reorganization of our federal ad- ;
ministrative system.
Here are a few excerpts from his
indictment of bureaucracy in govern
ment departments and commissions:
"It has been estimated that 52 gov
ernmental agencies are feverishly
sending out questionnaires and com
piling data, and that more than $20,-
000,000 a year is being spent in gath
ering facts."
"The Bureau of Home Economics 1
costs the American taxpayers approxi- j
mately a quarter million dollars annu- j
ally to disseminate information about j
garments for small boys and setting of
sleeves in armseyes of 'garments, with j
sets of 47 lantern slides on First Aid
in Window Curtaining and 52 slides on '
What Shall I Wear!"
"The Farm Board was at once the
most costly and inexcusable legislative !
folly in our history. It has cost the !
American people $500,000,000."'
Beck's book is full of these startling
figures, but too many "approximate- |
ly's" and "it has been estimated's"
rather spoil the effect.
