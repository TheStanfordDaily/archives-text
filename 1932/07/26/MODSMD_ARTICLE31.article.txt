Editor, The Stanford Daily:
We are facing a breakdown of the ;
capitalist system. This situation the j
Socialist Party has long predicted. In j
the last campaign, it warned the people s
of the increasing insecurity in Ameri- J
can life and urged a program of action. |
which, if adopted, would have saved j
millions from their present tragic j
plight.
Unemployment and poverty are in- 1
evitable products of the present sys
tem. Under capitalism the few own
the industries. The many do the work.
The wage-earners and the farmers are
compelled to give a large part of the
product of their labor to the few. The j
many in the factories, mines, shops, j
offices, and farms obtain but a scanty J
income and are able to buy back but j
a part of the goods that can be pro
duced in such abundance by our mass
industries.
Capitalism spells not only wide
spread economic disaster, but class
strife. It likewise carries with it an
ever - present threat of international
war.
Respectfully,
â€”Bissell Magee
