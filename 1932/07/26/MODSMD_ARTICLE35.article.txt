Now that the Olympic tryouts are
over —depression is again with us.
Ballyhoo was predominant in Palo
Alto, being closely followed V>y the
campus and vicinity. Every place and
any place one went the Olympic ath
letes were welcome.
If they had the price.
There was an abundance of Olym
pic Headquarters—all were official.
"Welcome Olympic Athletes" was the
slogan and the motto ol the day.
And even the password.
One well-known establishment even
went so far as to advertise a "HEAD
QUARTERS FOR OLYMPIC TRY
OUTS." No doubt they were giving a
preliminary tryout of their own. Or
perhaps they thought thut the athletes
would have more room to train there.
Anyway it must have cost lots of
money to build a track just for (lie
occasion.
And then there were officials. Small
officials, large officials, fat officials.
Mostly I'at officials.
They all have to wear while pants,
blue coats, and white hats, and smoke
big cigars. The 'idea being to keep
the athletes from thinking that the
meet is being run for them.
If I'm wronar—sue me.
One bird didn't have a pair of
white pants, and he was awfully
ashamed of himself. Once in a while
he would peek at the crowd to see
if anybody was looking.
The strain was terrific.
The next day he wore a pair of
white pants which were several inches
too short for him. But oh, what a
change.
lie was happy and beaming—a new
man.
And now Los Angeles is making
preparations to have a fling at it.
There is a fight progressing to keep
the border entrance leading to Mexico
closed after a certain time. The idea,
I imagine, is that liquor manufactured
in L.A. is just as potent and just as
cheap as Mexico's.
I'm inclined to be skeptical.
Mexico is more exclusive.
