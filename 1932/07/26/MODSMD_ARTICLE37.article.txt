# HIGH POSTAL RATES FAIL TO DISCOURAGE BILLET-DOUX SCRIBES
## 
### 
The recent increase of mail rates
enacted, by the federal government
has apparently not made any out
standing change in the volume of
postal goods, according to D. E.
Wheeler, superintendent of the cam
put post office.
A quite common belief has been
that the volume of mail would vary
inversely with the increase of postal
rates. Because of the small enrollment
at Stanford this quarter, it is hard U>
make exact figures comparing the
daily volume of incoming and out
going mail with that of past quar
ters. But in general it is believed
Ihat the volume remains proportion
ately the same and, that including the
country as a whole, the government
will profit considerably by the reve
nue.
The negligence on the part of a
good number of people pops up regu
larly. Wheeler states it is not at all
an uncommon occurrance for people
to place mail in the box forgetting to
address it. The other day a post card
having a message of great importance
on one side failed to indicate its des
tination on the other. Consequently,
being posted on the bulletin board at
the post office, it there awaits its
owner, who may never see it.
