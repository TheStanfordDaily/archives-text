# MACHINES CLOCK RUNNERS' TIMES
## 
### 
The starter's gun barks, the runners
sprint down the field, spurt, and flash
over the finish line. Then the crowd
in the stadium becomes silent and
waits for the announcer to tell them
how the runners were timed.
At the Olympic tryouts at Stanford
three timing devices were used —the
electric hand timer, the camera timer,
and the official stop watch timer.
Both the camera and electric hand
instruments were used for test pur
poses at the trials. However, they
won't be official at the Olympic Games
down south. According to Harry Ma
loney, the electric timer has proven
more accurate than the clock. Malo
ney handled the electric instrument
here Friday and Saturday. But he
doubts if it will be used in meets for
some time yet, because of its expense.
The cost is $30,000 per machine.
Attached to Starter's Gun
The electric hand timer has an elec
tric attachment connected to the trig
ger on the starter's gun. When the
gun barks at the start of a race, it
automatically starts the electric clock,
and stops when the runners cross the
finish line, clocking their time.
The electric camera consists of a
motion picture camera set up on a
tripod at the finish line. At the start
of the race the gun goes off, timed
simultaneously to a clock. As the cam
era records pictures of the racers, so
too does it record, on the same film,
the hands of the clock. Camera and
clock are trained on each runner
crossing the finish line. Thus it gets
the time for all runners, determining
which comes in first, second, third, and
fourth.

Close to Official Time

Maloney believes lhat the electric
hand timer is more efficient, because
in the trials here it came closer to the
official time. The official time con
sists of checking the stop watches of
some eight officials and striking their
average.
In the 400-meter race, the camera
clocked 47.11, the electrical hand had
46.98, and the officials had 46.9. In the
100-meter run the camera registered
10.62, the electrical hand 10.59, and the
officials had 10.6. In the 10,000-meter
run the camera showed 32:18.89, the
electrical hand registered 32:18.83, and
the officials showed 32:18.20.

electrical hand registered 32:18.83, and
the officials showed 32:18.20.
The starter's gun barks, the runners
sprint down the field, spurt, and flash
over the finish line. Then the crowd
in the stadium becomes silent and
waits for the announcer to tell them
how the runners were timed.
At the Olympic tryouts at Stanford
three timing devices were used —the
electric hand timer, the camera timer,
and the official stop watch timer.
Both the camera and electric hand
instruments were used for test pur
poses at the trials. However, they
won't be official at the Olympic Games
down south. According to Harry Ma
loney, the electric timer has proven
more accurate than the clock. Malo
ney handled the electric instrument
here Friday and Saturday. But he
doubts if it will be used in meets for
some time yet, because of its expense.
The cost is $30,000 per machine.
Attached to Starter's Gun
The electric hand timer has an elec
tric attachment connected to the trig
ger on the starter's gun. When the
gun barks at the start of a race, it
automatically starts the electric clock,
and stops when the runners cross the
finish line, clocking their time.
The electric camera consists of a
motion picture camera set up on a
tripod at the finish line. At the start
of the race the gun goes off, timed
simultaneously to a clock. As the cam
era records pictures of the racers, so
too does it record, on the same film,
the hands of the clock. Camera and
clock are trained on each runner
crossing the finish line. Thus it gets
the time for all runners, determining
which comes in first, second, third, and
fourth.

Close to Official Time

Maloney believes lhat the electric
hand timer is more efficient, because
in the trials here it came closer to the
official time. The official time con
sists of checking the stop watches of
some eight officials and striking their
average.
In the 400-meter race, the camera
clocked 47.11, the electrical hand had
46.98, and the officials had 46.9. In the
100-meter run the camera registered
10.62, the electrical hand 10.59, and the
officials had 10.6. In the 10,000-meter
run the camera showed 32:18.89, the
electrical hand registered 32:18.83, and
the officials showed 32:18.20.
