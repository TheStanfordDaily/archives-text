# FOUR CARDS PUT ON SWIM SQUAD
## 
### 
Under the colors of the L.A.A.C.
water polo team four Stanford mer
-1 men will line up to splash it out for
i th'e glory of Uncle Sam, In the coming
j Olympics.
Three former Stanford water polo
captains, Austin Clapp, Cal Strong, and
Dutch McAlister, are among those j
: chosen on this all-American team. The j
' other Cardinal to win a berth is Wally |
j O'Connor, a veteran of three Olympic j
i campaigns.
In the relay event, Ted Wiget, na- |
tional 440-yard champion, and Frank [
Booth, holder of the Pacific Coast 220-
i yard, both Stanford swimmers, will j
compose half of the United States !
' team.
j Norton Thornton, Stanford swim- i
' ming coach, anticipates that the battle
in the water will be waged between '
i the strong Japanese team and the
Americans. In the relay, Thornton
! gives the United States the edge and
! looks for this country to win the
springboard diving event, with a pos
sible triumph in the back-stroke.
In the 400-meter, 1500-meter, and
the breast stroke, the Japanese look
formidable.
In the water polo series Thornton
picks Hungary to place first above the
United States, but with strong teams
from France, Germany, and England
this event promises upsets.
