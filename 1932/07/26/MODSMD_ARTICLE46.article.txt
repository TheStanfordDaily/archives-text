# OLYMPIC TRACK RECORDS TO FALL IN LOS ANGELES, PREDICTS HENRY
## 
### LEONARD HORWIN 
"En route to the ash-can" describes J
the position of every existing Olympic
track and field record, in the opinion
of William M. Henry, sports technical
director of the Tenth Olympiad Com
mittee in Los Afigeles.
At Amsterdam, 12 Olympic records
were broken and two more tied.
With 40 out of the 50 entrant na- |
tions in the tenth Olympiad, July 30 1
to August 14, scheduled to participate !
in the track and field events alone, j
Henry predicts a new and wholesale
smashing of time and distance records, j
Better weather conditions than in Am- ,
sterdam; far more Select choice of atlv- ;
letes; finest facilities in athletic his- j
tory; a cut from four to three in the j
number of entries from each country i
in each event, resulting in fewer heats j
—here is the "dopester's" vision of a !
record-breaking Olympiad.
When Records Go by the Hoard
With athletes from five continents :
having already broken the 100-meter j
mark of 10.6 seconds made in 1912, j
and with 24 countries entered in the j
sprints of the Olympiad, Metcalfe, To- j
lan, and Simpson are in for a storm of
split seconds.
Archie Hahn's 200-meter mark of {

(U.C'.L.A. Correspondent)

21.6 made in 11)04 at St. Louis appears
due for a well-earned retirement. A.
V/. Winter's (Australia) hop step and
jump mark of 50 feet 11 Vi inches, set
at Paris in 1924, will bo assailed by
athletes from 18 countries, as will the
world's high-jump record.
Irish Supreme in Hammer
Only the Irish remain serenely con
, fident of supremacy in Ireland's fa
j vorite event, the hammer throw. From
| the misty days when burly Irish
j knights vied in heaving boulders to
j win fame and the smiles of blue-eyed
I colleens, Irish weight-heaving prowess
has been proverbial.
[ If it isn't the hammer throw record
jof 179 feet 8.4 inches made at Stock -
j holm by a New York Irish policeman,
j says the Irishman, it will be a new
I mark set by O'Callaghan of the Irish
! Olympic team.
New Countries Entered
In the vanguard of an Olympic in
vasion of more than 2,000 will
be found the representatives of eight
new Olympic nations—Brazil, China,
| Columbia, Salvador, Peru, Venezuela,
Costa Rica, and Guatemala.
To most of these folks the advantage
of an Olympic meeting-ground close
at hand was the deciding factor.
