AUSTIN, Tox.—Modern medical and j
pharmaceutical science owes much to ;
.the chance cures and the superstitious j
practices of olden times, and to the |
American Indian for knowledge of the |
vises of many herbs native to this j
country, according to Dean W. F. Gid- (
ley, of the University of Texas College ;
of Pharmacy.
"Every American Indian tribe had;
its medicine man," states Dean Gidley. i
"He claimed supernatural powers, ;
practiced with charms and fetishes, j
chanted and prayed, and dispensed I
medicines, mostly herbs, in the form 1
of decoctions, ointments, plasters, and
liniments.
"The cause and nature of diseases i
were mostly unknown mysteries to |
him, but he had an astonishing knowl- !
edge of the action of various crude
drugs such as cough remedies, cathar
tics, stimulants, and antiseptics. In
fact, our forefathers gained from the
American Indian a knowledge of many |
drugs which today are listed in the j
United States Pharmacopoea, the offi
cial book of standards for medicinal |
products.
Among the various herbs which are !
still used are spikenard, for coughs; I
calamus root, or Sweet Flag, for colds, j
fevers, coughs, etc.; Lady Slipper root, '
long a remedy for toothache; Culver's !
root; snake root, a tonic; boneset, an j
Indian charm; golden seal, now cost
ing $6.50 a pound—a remedy for ulcers
which has found a place in modern |
medicinal ingredients; Indian tobacco: :
and yellow dock root.
