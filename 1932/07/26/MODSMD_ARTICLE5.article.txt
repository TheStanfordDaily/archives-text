# COLLINS URGES HALL RESIDENTS TO PASS DAILIES
## 
### 
Students who have the Summer
Daily delivered to their rooms
should not take copies from the
Engineering or English corners,
according to Keith Collins, busi
ness manager.
Much confusion has arisen from
this practice, and many students
have missed their paper as a re
sult. Only enough copies are put
at these corners, and at the Book
store, for those who do not get
room delivery, and if papers are
taken by hall residents, it means
that someone else will not get his
Daily.
The paper is distributed be
tween 0:30 and 10 o'clock on
Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
