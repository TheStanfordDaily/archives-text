# CROWD THRILLED BY STRING QUARTET AT SUMMER MUSICALE
## 
### 
Presenting a program of a delight
fully balanced nature, the Pro Arte
String Quartet of Brussels showed it
self to be of inexhaustible sensibility
and incomparable technique last night
in Toyon Hall. Despite its length, the
program elicited a response from the
audience which expressed deep ap
preciation as weii as enthusiasm which
has seldom been exhibited by campus
music lovers.
The three numbers rendered were
distinguished by exquisite blending as
well as perfect shading, transition and
fluidify of movement, yet each retained
a clearness and modulation which was
nothing short of remarkable. Quoting
H. T. Parker of the Boston Transcript,
"The profile of every theme, the out
line of every phrase and period ran
clear. The Pro Arte took perfect cue."
Following is the program, slightly
altei'ed from previous announcements:
Quartet in G major, Opus 77, No. 1
Haydn
Quartet in B flat major, Opus 130,
No. 13 (1825) Beethoven
Quartet in G minor, Opus 10 Debussy
