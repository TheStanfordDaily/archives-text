# DOWNES, N.Y. TIMES CRITIC, SPEAKS ON JEAN SIBELIUS
## 
### 
An intimate picture of Jean Sibelius, Finnish composer, revealing him as
the Loneliest and most heroic figure in modern music, was presented by Olin
Downes, music critic, yesterday in the second of his Monday afternoon talks
in the Assembly Hall. "One isn't speaking of a man who is from a past era
when one speaks of Sibelius," Downes stated. "One is speaking of a man whose
I work is so modern that it extends into the past, and far into the future."

Jean Sibelius, according to Downes,
who was with him in Finland a month
ago, is the most loved man of his own
country. He is impersonal, incredibly
aloof, and can see no reason why he
should ever be encouraged over an en
thusiastic public.
Downes pointed out the great loneli
ness of theme which is always preva
lent in his work. Where Bach and
Beethoven wrote from heart to heart,
Sibelius has written to himself.
"Perhaps there is no composer now
living who approaches the feeling of
Sibelius' music," Downes said. ''His
originality is so astounding as to be
above critical analysis."
The striking fact that Sibelius re
fuses to discuss his own music, and
when questioned about it becomes na
ive and modest, is further proof, says
Downes, that the man himself is his
music.
"Folk-music and Art-music in Po
land" is to be the subject of a special
lecture to be given by Olin Downes at
8 o'clock Thursday evening in the As
sembly Hall.
