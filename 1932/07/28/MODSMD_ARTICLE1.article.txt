# COWARD COMEDY READING SCORES WITH AUDIENCE
## Marian Jones Outstanding In Competent Cast Of Local Actors Nancy Roberts, James Sandoe Score Hits; "St. Joan" Reading Next 
### 
Noel Coward's waggish and sophis
ticated comedy, "Home Chat," was
read to a large and appreciative audi
ence by the combined Sword and San
dals and English clubs last night in the
Little Theatre.
The farcial plot concerned itself
with the various pseudo-adventures of
one Janet Ebony, who finds herself
in hot water with her husband and
family over the sharing of a train com
partment with an old friend, male of
course. The audience is led to believe
that this friendship is purely platnoic.
Brilliant Dialogue
Sparkling dialogue is the feature of
the play, although the plot attracts
with its foolish and hair-brained auda
city. Honors, in general, were evenly
shared. However, Marian Jones, as
Janet Ebony, gave the most finished
characterization.
In this comedy of morals, the hero of
the story is made to appear as an un
mitigated prig, while the one who or
dinarily would be socially ostracized
is shown to be quite a nice fellow.
Coward achieves a notable dialogue
by inserting seemingly irrelevant re
marks into the lines of the play. It is
characteristic of the work with which
he scored in '"Private Lives."
Nancy Roberts, assuming the part of
Lavinia Hardy, the girl who fancies
she has been wronged by the actions
of her fiance, gave a sympathetic char
acterization of her role.
James Sandoe, as Peter, the man in
the wagon-lit, portrayed the trouble
some old busybody.
Audicncc Pleased
Waldo Salt, Myna Hughes, Caretta
Miles, William Mahu, and Virginia
Clemens completed the cast, each read
ing his respective part in a thoroughly
interesting manner.
Enthusiastic applause at the finish of
tube reading was a tribute to the efforts
of the characters, as well as an appre
ciation of the quality of the play chosen
for the evening's entertainment.
The next offering of the combined
group will be George Bernard Shaw's
"St. Joan," to take place sometime
near the end of the quarter. The cast
ing is as yet unfinished.
