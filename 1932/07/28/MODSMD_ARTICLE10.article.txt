Taxation Mentioned
"Methods of taxation, known since
Biblical times,, have come to be so
cleverly manipulated today," he said,
"that people are actually paying money
where they believe themselves to be
tax-free. The farther away you try to
push taxes, the larger the burden will
be. It is better to invest your money
locally than to allow your congressman
to use it in Washington."
After being introduced by Acting-
President E. Swain, Wilbur
opened his address with a brief review
of the activities of the Washington
Child Welfare Conference, of which he
was named chairman by President
Hoover. In this regard he mentioned
the findings of the Committee on Costs
of Medical Care, which discovered that
physicians in certain areas spend from
$4,000 to $10,000 annually before a pa
tient receives actual treatment, a fac
tor which, Wilbur stated,,is the cause
of a great unevenness in the expenses
of different familites.
Department Activities
The main body of Wilbur's address
was concerned with the activities of
the Interior Department. In conclusion
he dwelt for a few minutes on a com
parison of the United States of today
with that of the time of Washington
and Jefferson.
"People throughout the nation are
not so sufficiently self-supporting as
they were years ago, to continue in
happiness and prosperity when indus
tries are slowed down," he explained.
