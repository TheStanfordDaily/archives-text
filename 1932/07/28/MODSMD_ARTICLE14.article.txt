# Merger Plan Proposed To Save 200 U.S. Railroads
## 
### 
Proposed as a measure of relief, the
1 four-system consolidation plan ap-
I proved last week by the Interstate
i Commerce Commission may alleviate
j present financial troubles of the rail-
I loads, in the opinion of Dr. Donald
, Erb, acting professor of economics.
The plan proposes to build (he na
tion's network of rails around the
| present systems of the New York Cen
tral, the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore
and Ohio, and the Chesapeake and
Ohio-Nickel Plate lines.
The commission's plan had provided
( for a fifth line to include the Wabash
and Seaboard Airline but under the
'approved scheme these lines would be
consolidated with the Pennsylvania
railroad.
This consolidation plan will under
take the task of organizing over 200
present lines into four, and in com
| menting on this ambitious work Erb
holds that "it will undoubtedly take
, years for all of the railroads to be so

adjusted as to be in positions to be
absorbed by the four proposed sys
tems."
Whether the consolidation will result
in the economies which its backers
j claim for it is in Erb's belief a very
| debatable point. Many of the nation's
i competent railway authorities argue
that the consolidation will result in an
inefficient and unwieldy national traf
fic system. In spite of this the Inter
state Commerce Commission must be
j influenced by a statute passed in 1920,
'which favors the consolidation of the
I railroads with an end to simplifying
J the machinery of rate regulation
; through the creation of railroads of
I comparable strength.
"This consolidation plan represents
;an effort on the part of the railroads
J to meet their present financial and new
| competitive problems, and is due to
! claim a good share of public interest
(before it is finally settled," Erb con-
J eluded,
