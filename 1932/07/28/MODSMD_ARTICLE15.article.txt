# Music Talks In Assembly Hall
## Downes Will Continue Series On European Art 
### 
Because of the widespread public in- j
I terest shown toward the summer series j
of lectures by Olin Downes, the re- ;
j maining talks are to be given in the j
I Assembly Hall instead of the Little
I Theatre. Many had to be turned away
from his last lecture.
At 8 o'clock tonight Downes will I
speak on "Folk-music and Art-music ■
in Poland." After an extensive tour |
of Europe, the New York Times critic |
has returned to America with a great j
amount of interesting material. He has j
already given his impressions of Rus
sia in two lectures, and turned to J
Finland for his third. Thursday eve- i
ning's lecture will give him another j
opportunity to tell further of his ac
quaintances with famous composers, j
and of his impressoins of that country. !
According to Downes, Russia ancl
Finland have gone far beyond us in !
music, because they have expressed j
| themselves in their art, and have not i
j striven for effect. Being a musician as !
; well as a critic, Downes will illustrate
| orchestral themes upon the piano and j
| explain their meaning and emotional j
j expressions.
