# SENATE ASPIRANT SPEAKS ON TODAY'S SOCIAL PROBLEMS
## 
### 
"Corruption or Collapse" was the
subject on which George Kirpatrick,
Socialist candidate for United States
senator, spoke at Union Hall, Palo
Alto, Tuesday evening.
"Increase of population has through
the ages forced man to seek more
food, either by industrial improvement
or expansion to new land," Kirkpatrick
said, "man being by nature more or
less a lazy animal, has always run
away from this problem by expanding
to new land. But now," Kirkpatrick
continued, "all land has been used up,
and the only solution to the problem is
co-operation in the use of land."
