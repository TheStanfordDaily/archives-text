# PROPOSED RACE TRACK OPPOSED BY UNIVERSITY
## Almon E. Roth Files Formal Stanford Protest At Menlo Meeting Public Meeting On Question Scheduled For Next Tuesday Night 
### 
Vigorous opposition lo the proposed
j dog racing track in Menlo Park was
expressed by Stanford at a meeting of
the Menlo city council Monday night.
A public hearing on the matter will be
I held at 8 o'clock next Tuesday night
;at which Almon E. Roth. University
I comptroller, is expected to lead the
j fight against the project.
Three Menlo Park residents are
sponsoring the proposed concession,
and 30 other Menlonians signed a pe
tition favoring the establishment of the
track. It is rumored, however, that out
| side interests, presumably the Belmont
| group, are backing the scheme.
Although little opposition was voiced
!at the last council meeting aside from
the University protest, the Menlo city
fathers refused to grant a similar per
mit several months ago. Representa
tives of various social, educational, and
religious institutions have fought the
plan previously, and will continue to
l do so.
Seek Palo Alio Support
The dog racing sponsors approached
| certain Palo Alto interests, seeking
l support, but failed to attain any • re
i suits.
i In a letter to the Menlo Park city
council Comptroller Roth pointed out
the menace to the base hospital and
University which would result from
I such a concession. His complete state-
I ment follows:
j " "Stanford University has just re
ceived information to the effect that
I application has been made for the con
j struction of a dog racing plant at
| Menlo Park.
Formal Protest Launched
"It seems inconceivable that a com
munity of the type of Menlo Park
would countenance an enterprise of
this character, with its attendant evil
of gambling. It is bad enough to have
j these gambling institutions located as
near the base hospital and the Univer
sity as Belmont, without having them
located immediately adjacent to these
two institutions.
"On behalf of the University I am
i writing to protest against the granting
| of any such license, and it is our sin
i cere hope that your council will deny
j the application.
"I shall appreciate very much an
opportunity of presenting the Univer
sity's viewpoint in the event that a
hearing is held regarding this matter."
Claim Unemployment Benefit
In their petition to the city council,
| the signers stressed the possible em
j ployment benefits resulting from such
! a concession. They request for a permit
"to conduct an amusement park with
dog racing" on a 3-16 mile track and
grandstand at Kuck's picnic grounds
on Oak Grove avenue, between the
railroad tracks and the highway. They
add:
"This would give immediate employ
ment to about 40 local unemployed
who would be paid $4 per day. . . .
When the track is in operation we be
lieve it will furnish work to 75 or 100
unemployed men and women of our
city.
"This would relieve the unemployed
situation, which is very bad at this
time. The residents of Menlo Park who
patronize the track at Belmont would
! be the same ones that would patronize
i the track here, and it would also bring
I out-of-town money to Menlo Park."

Seek Palo Alio Support
The dog racing sponsors approached
| certain Palo Alto interests, seeking
l support, but failed to attain any • re
i suits.
i In a letter to the Menlo Park city
council Comptroller Roth pointed out
the menace to the base hospital and
University which would result from
I such a concession. His complete state-
I ment follows:
j " "Stanford University has just re
ceived information to the effect that
I application has been made for the con
j struction of a dog racing plant at
| Menlo Park.
Formal Protest Launched
"It seems inconceivable that a com
munity of the type of Menlo Park
would countenance an enterprise of
this character, with its attendant evil
of gambling. It is bad enough to have
j these gambling institutions located as
near the base hospital and the Univer
sity as Belmont, without having them
located immediately adjacent to these
two institutions.
"On behalf of the University I am
i writing to protest against the granting
| of any such license, and it is our sin
i cere hope that your council will deny
j the application.
"I shall appreciate very much an
opportunity of presenting the Univer
sity's viewpoint in the event that a
hearing is held regarding this matter."
Claim Unemployment Benefit
In their petition to the city council,
| the signers stressed the possible em
j ployment benefits resulting from such
! a concession. They request for a permit
"to conduct an amusement park with
dog racing" on a 3-16 mile track and
grandstand at Kuck's picnic grounds
on Oak Grove avenue, between the
railroad tracks and the highway. They
add:
"This would give immediate employ
ment to about 40 local unemployed
who would be paid $4 per day. . . .
When the track is in operation we be
lieve it will furnish work to 75 or 100
unemployed men and women of our
city.
"This would relieve the unemployed
situation, which is very bad at this
time. The residents of Menlo Park who
patronize the track at Belmont would
! be the same ones that would patronize
i the track here, and it would also bring
I out-of-town money to Menlo Park."
Vigorous opposition lo the proposed
j dog racing track in Menlo Park was
expressed by Stanford at a meeting of
the Menlo city council Monday night.
A public hearing on the matter will be
I held at 8 o'clock next Tuesday night
;at which Almon E. Roth. University
I comptroller, is expected to lead the
j fight against the project.
Three Menlo Park residents are
sponsoring the proposed concession,
and 30 other Menlonians signed a pe
tition favoring the establishment of the
track. It is rumored, however, that out
| side interests, presumably the Belmont
| group, are backing the scheme.
Although little opposition was voiced
!at the last council meeting aside from
the University protest, the Menlo city
fathers refused to grant a similar per
mit several months ago. Representa
tives of various social, educational, and
religious institutions have fought the
plan previously, and will continue to
l do so.
