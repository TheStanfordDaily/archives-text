# STUDENTS IN THE RENAISSANCE
## 
### 
Speaking a! the University assembly Tuesday morning, Dr.
Wilbur declared that university men and women must lead in
the renaissance to revamp our present crisis, and solve the
problem by taking every opportunity in their districts for solid
work and community spirit.
"If we are to keep our democracy," he said, "every intelligent
person must help solve his community problems, and study to
get the most out of his limited resources."
But the most serious obstacle this plan faces is the cynicism
and skepticism of college students, he added. That must be
outgrown. Only by a broad-minded, tolerant outiook can this
be accomplished. We are prejudiced, our convictions are firm,
and we argue passionately, sometimes blindly, with those who
advance arguments for the "other side." This is an unhealthy
attitude.
One should be liberal, and ready to hear the other fellow's
opinion. This can be accomplished in part bv reading maga
zines of opinion and current events and IP tting both sides of a
question. But of greater importance is the "human" element
. . . . the will to be open-minded.
