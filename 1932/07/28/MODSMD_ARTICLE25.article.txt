Whether Menlo Park will have dog' racing or not will prob
ahlv he decided next week I>v the eitv council. The backers
claim that such a concession \\ r i 11 help to relieve the unemploy
ment problem in that city, and that it will tend to bring outside
money into the town.
Construction and upkeep of a race track would undoubtedly
give work to some Menlo Park residents, but it would also

grants notoriously frequent gambling resorts, and the city might

professional gamblers, dog owners, etc. The men who support

their money with them.
As far as the average university student is concerned, the

a student wants to gamble on dog races, he would just as soon
go up to Belmont; if he does not want to gamble, he won't even
bother to cross the creek.
One thing for the Menlo Park city council to consider is
whether or not the town wants the reputation attendant on such
a project; and whether, in the long run, there is any profit to
the community in such an enterprise.
