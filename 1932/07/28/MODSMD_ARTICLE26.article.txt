# "WE'RE ON THE AIR"

Football broadcasts are here to stay. That was the decision
ot Pacific Coast Conference officials at their annual confab in
Pasadena, a decision of vital significance to the present and
tut lire of the great collegiate game. Disregarding the precedent
set by the Eastern and Big Ten Conferences, which banned radio
announcers for the forthcoming season, the Western moguls
displayed a wisdom all their own in deciding to retain the good
w ill of that vast portion of football fandom which gets its thrills
via air.
Again this fall the silver-tongued oratory of the stadium
broadcaster will be wafted into thousands of living-rooms 011
the Pacific Coast. And who can say how far eastward that
oratory may drift, making new friends for Western universities
and Western football?
"The bands are playing, people are pouring through the
entrances into this great bowl. Over there is the Stanford root
ing section, a huge red 'S' on a white background. The sun is
warm and there is a faint breeze in the stadium. It's a beautiful
day out here in California, folks. I wish you could all be here
to see it and to see the great game which this contest is sure
to be "
And the fotball fan in Dubuque, who has no big team that
he can watch on his Saturday afternoon off, will probably wish
lie were here too.
