# WE BEGIN TO PAY TAXES
## 
### 
II doesn't lake long for people Jo become lax-conscious when
llieir pocketbooks are affected, no matter how small the amount
may be.
I'nivcrsity students, so far, have escaped Ibis burden fairly
well. The average collegian is not bothered with property or
income taxes, and so pays little attention to them.
Now, however, the new tax system is hitting us right where
â€¢ we live. II takes a three-cent stamp to mail a letter; it costs a
cent-per-gallon more for gasoline; every check we write costs
us another two cents; we pay 1(1 per cent more for movies, track
meets, and other amusements; and so on, ad infinitum.
Political observers have recently noticed a rising tide of
interest in government affairs by college men and women. Now
that we are face to face with the insidious t;i\ problem, they can
expect a regular llood.
Public finance and other similar "econ" courses should be
crowded next year. We collegians have been forced to become
"tax-conscious."
