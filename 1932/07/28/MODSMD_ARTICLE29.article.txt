UNASHAMED—At the New Stanford
Theatre.
M.G.M. hasn't succeeded as yet in
placing Robert Young in a really good
movie. "Unashamed," their latest at
tempt, falls short, notwithstanding the
presence of persimmon-lipped Helen
Twelvetrees as the young heroine in
this mediocre celluloid flicker.
The story of "Unashamed" was taken
from real life; a murder trial held in
Philadelphia recently. Briefly, sister
(Helen Twelvetrees) goes away over
night with the suave villain. When she
comes home, her brother kills the mis
creant. Naturally he is put on trial for
murder, and, naturally too, the li'l sis
ter, who got good and mad at her
brother for his knocking-off of her
lover, comes through, and, with the
help of the old family lawyer (Lewis
Stone), pulls brother out of the big
house.
Lewis Stone, who has appeared with
Robert Young in all of Young's pic
tures, takes the acting honors, although
Helen Twelvetrees successfully stone
faces her way into apparent histrionic
ability. —T.F.D.

WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD—At the
Meolo Theatre.
We confess we anticipated much
ballyhoo concerning the pitfalls and
difficulties besetting the path of the
would-be actress, in the form of a
beautiful but dumb waitress at The
Brown Derby in Hollywood.
However, the lovely Constance Ben
nett displays all of her best talents
wearing everything from a bathing
suit to a sports costume and succeeds
in ensnaring the dashing Neil Hamil
ton, who displays his handsome pan in
the form of a polo player wary of
(and heretofore weary of) cheap,
Hollywood blondes.
Then too, one of the cleverest pieces
of photography in many months helps
to alleviate an otherwise dragging plot.
The story itself is asserted to be a
satire on the private lives of motion
picture stars, but few moments are
devoted to poking fun at Hollywood,
and on the whole it has a ring of sin
cerity which results in a convincing
show.
Lowell Sherman portrays the part of
a booze fighting director who "dis
covers" the blonde and beautiful wait
ress, takes her in a pinch to an open
ing night at Grauman's Chinese Thea
tre, gives her a "break" on the lot, and
then proceeds to take the downward
path to poverty and obscurity, a vic
tim of drink. We automatically award
Mr. Sherman the coveted ihree stars
for exceptional acting. —J.R.B.

MALICE IN WONDERLAND—By Jack
Mason and I)on Norton. Illustrated
by Jim Sheridan. 19.'52. $1.
This little volume of sixty-four
pages of satirical verse was written by
two University of California men and
illustrated by a third. It consists of
light, humorous glimpses of under
graduate life on the Berkeley campus,
and is full of sly jabs at outstanding
Blue and Gold personalities and in
stitutions.
Norton was editor of the Daily Cali

fornian in the fall of 1929. and Mason
held the same post in 1930. Sheridan
was a football quarterback for three
years, and is well known for his off
campus work under the name of
"Michael O'Sheridan."
The edition is limited to 250 copies,
all autographed. —N.V.S.
VERY PRIVATE SIN —By Laurel
Oliver. $2.
In this gay and caustic novel the
familiar theme of young love in the
toils of parental disapprobation is han
dled with a deliciously wicked humor
which spares none of the characters.
Stephen Hav/kins, young heir appar
ent of an ultra-respectable family, falls
desperately in love with a lovely
young actress of unknown, and hence
suspicious, antecedents—and the fun
begins. His beloved mother is out
wardly sweet and sympathetic, but
secretly strives to make Una appear
cheap and vulgar to her son. The un
expected conclusion is reached when
Una's mother is produced and con
founds the plotters in no uncertain
style.
"Very Private Sin" is a delightful
affair—with excellent though often
cruel characterizations and a subtle
barbed wit which occasionally breaks
over with unrestrained hilarity.—B.K.
