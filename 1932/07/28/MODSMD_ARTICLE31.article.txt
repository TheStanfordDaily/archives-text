# CAMPUS OPINION

### WE ARE REBUKED 
The Editor, Sir:
Due to tho small number of students
at the summer session, the news value
of our paper is at low ebb through the
summer months.
However, the morale of the Daily
should not suffer. The strident edi
torials, ever our pride, are now mere
discussions, uninspired and thoroughly
dilettante. The editors' demands for
social activities for all, always a note
worthy feature of the Stanford paper,
was apparently satisfied by a one-hour
Koble jolly-up. It might more honor
ably have ended in Daily-sponsored
dances or even more editorials.
And the famed Bull Session has de
teriorated into a jumble of sordid and
morbid and withal very jerky opinions
of this and of that. "If you ask me,"
the purpose of a columnist, if not to be
amusing and charming, is, at least, to
be pleasing.
The students pay an appreciable
amount every quarter to support the
paper. Why should they not be given
sincere and selective judgment from
their editors, and reasonably intelligent
and pleasing columnists?
