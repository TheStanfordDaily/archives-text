# BAD ALCOHOL KILLS BIRDS FEEDING ON DATE PALM FRUIT
## UCLA Professor Finds Toxic Poisoning As Cause Of Waxwings' Death 
### 
Bad alcohol apparently is taking its
toll of bird life as well as humans.
Professor Loye Miller of the University
of California at Los Angeles has just
reported the death of forty-two Cedar
Waxwings under conditions which
pointed to toxic alcohol from ferment
ing fruit as the causative agent.
The birds were picked up under an
ornamental palm in the garden of Rob
ert Fowler of Los Angeles. A flock of
some two hundred Waxwings had been
feeding on the fruit of the palm. One
day twenty-five of the birds fluttered
down to the ground, gasped and died.
The next day seventeen additional
birds were found.
Examination Shows Ferment
Fowler reported the occurrence to
Professor Miller of the biology depart
ment of the University, and brought
the dead birds in for examination. In
a report written for the Condor, orni
thologists' magazine edited by Profes
sor Joseph Grinnell of the University
of California, Miller says:
"Stomach examination showed plant
tissues ascribed to the date; fruits had
been picked into. A sticky fluid smell
ing of fermented fruit ran from the
mouths of many of the birds and had
smeared their feathers. The birds were
all excessively fat. Examination for in
ternal parasites was made by Dr. Gor
don Ball, with negative r'esults. Dis
section showed marked congestion in
the head region, but no other lesion
was noted.
Fruit Investigated Also
"Fruits were examined by Dr. O. A.
Plunkett for poisonous fungi, but no
unusual forms were found. No form of
spray had been applied to the trees of
the vicinity and there would be no
reason to spray these valueless fruits.
Tests for mineral poisons were not
made. The cause of death remains un
proven, though the following hypothe
sis offers possibilities.
"Ripe fruits of the ornamental date
remain on the tree for considerable
periods of time. The weather preceding
the occurrence had been very hot for
a long period of time. Fermentation
changes in the tannin and sugars nor
mal in these fruits could readily have
produced some toxic alcohols or other
complex organic compounds that would
result in acute poisoning. Ordinarily
ethyl alcohol would be the product na
turally expected of such fermentation,
i but such higll mortality would hardly
be expected from this alcohol."
