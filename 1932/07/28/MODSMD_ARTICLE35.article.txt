# EASTMAN DISPLAYS OLD CLASS, SPEED IN L.A. WORKOUTS
## Lane Running At Olympics To Give Big Ben Advantage Over Bill Carr 
### 
Ben Eastman, who arrived quietly
at Olympic Village Tuesday to take up
hi.s residence, has an excellent chance j
to win the 400-meter race in the Tenth
Olympic Games. The Card speedster ,
appeared to have taken on new form '
when viewed in yesterday's practice
session.
Eastman looked more like the phe- !
nomenal quarter-miler of a few months j
ago when he walked out on the prac
tice track yesterday and did a few :
laps under the tutelage of Lawson Rob- '
ertson, head coach of Uncle Sam's !
Olympic forces.
Curves Are Baffling
Another fact, much in Eastman's fa- j
vor, is the unfamiliarity of Bill Carr,
who beat Eastman recently, with the |
curved track. Carr does not seem able
to judge his pace when running on a '
track of this description. As a matter ;
of fact, yesterday Coach Robertson had
Carr and Jim Gordon, third member
of the 400-meter team, running around
the curves on the practice track. Both j
Carr and Gordon expressed slight be
wilderment as to best way to run when ;
faced with a track of this sort.
Eastman will encounter no such dif- J
ficulty, for he has been racing on ;
tracks of this description since the first j
of the year.
Spencer Picks Ben
Inasmuch as "Blazin' Ben" has been j
dogged with the idea of Carr beating
him, a few days' practice with the tiny
runner from Penn will do a lot + o re- j
lieve his mind from this trouble.
"Bud" Spencer, holder of the official |
400-meter record, picks Eastman to win
for the above reasons. Spencer also i
makes the prediction that Eastman will
not do any starting in his race. Instead, I
Spencer says, Big Ben will run with
the bunch until that time he figures is ;
right to let out full speed. Then all the !
rest of the field will see of him will be
a pair of flying, dust-kicking heels. ;
