# STANFORD TO HOLD ANNUAL SWIM MEET FOR ALL STUDENTS
## 
### 
On August 18 Stanford , University j
will hold its annual summer swimming
meet at the Encina pools. The meet
will be open to the public with ad- j
mission free.
There will be both novice and open
classes with a large silver cup going j
to the winner in each event, and in |
the open 100-yard free-style cups for
both first and second.
As far as Stanford is concerned no
vice class means those who have never
won a numeral or letter at Stanford
for swimming. This is done in order
to give summer material a chance to
show its stuff without varsity competi
tion.
The novice events are the 50-yard
free-style, 50-yard breast-stroke, and }
the 50-yard back-stroke. These events
are open to all regularly enrolled stu- I
dents who have not been on the var- |
city or freshman swimming team.
There will also be an exhibition
water polo game and a relay race be- j
tween two picked teams of Stanford
students.
