# ENCINA CLEANED, BEDS TUNED FOR FROSH INVASION
## 
### 
Encina Hall, that remarkable
relic of Stanford democracy, which
has withstood the ravages of some
forty freshman classes, is being
prepared for the invasion of an
other. The men of '35 took a heavy
toll from the long-suffering edi
fice, workmen have found. Several
trucks have been employed in
carrying away the debris of En
cina's most recent occupants.
The iron beds on which the
frosh rest their weary bones have
been taken over to the Corpora
tion Yard and tuned up for their
labors this fall. Holes kicked in
walls and doors have been patched
anew.
And now that futile feeling
which the Encina workman must
experience every summer as he
surveys the old building rejuven
ated and departs, saying (in the
words of Noah) "After the de
luge."
