# INDIAN SUMMER-SPORT FAN'S FANCY LIGHTLY TURNS TO THOUGHTS OF GRID
## 
### Jack Shidler 
With campus track cxcitement out
of the way, let's wander and think
of this fall's varsity. There will be
eighteen lettermen back, 'ncluding
five regulars. The goof and last year's
frosh squad have good, although un
tried, material to offer.
The schedule starts on September
17 and closes with an intersectional
game with Pittsburgh on the latter's
field November 26. The new men will
tell the story of the '32 season team,
for a nucleus of five regulars will
need better men thaif the spring
practice showed if the team is to go
through the season undefeated.
Pop Changes Strategy
Spring quarter l'odtball indicated
that Pop Warner, Indian mentor, has
abandoned "C" formation, that he will
not use the double fullback and make
the quarter a ball-packer as well as
a blocker, and that he has changed
his "shift."
The Indians lost ' few outstanding
players from the 1931 team by gradu
ation for the simple reason that they
had very few. A! Norgard, Mike Rey
nolds, and Phil Neill, tl very
capable end substitutes, will ot re
turn, but this should not \vorr>
the reason follows —Don Colvi.
Doub, Jay Tod, Thorny Rodgers,
los. Monsalve, Dave Packard, Gle..
Buchanan, and Dick Philippi will bt
on hand. Philippi looked like a winner
for an end position last spring.
Blanchard Another Heinecke
The tackle problem may be solved
by two boys whose names won't fit
into headlines, Ben Palamountain and
Ed Lettunich. Ben was on the varsity
squad last year but didn't compete
and Ed sparkled in the 1931 frosh
line. Both of these boys are big, rough,
and tough, and have the inside track
for the jobs. Chuck Ehrhorn and Red
Hand graduated, but George Grey,
Red Gribben, Henri Laborde, Jack
Holwerda, Phil Johnston, Nellie Gray,

and Chuck Prelsnik will answer to
the roll call.
Bill Corbus will "return to take over
his guard position and should cause
Indian opponents plenty of trouble;
Bill is the > coast's leading Ail-Ameri
can candidate. Hulen, Heiser, and
Dawson will be gone but Windy
Bigelow, Fred Scribner, John Pilot
tram, Runston Maino, Bruce Tarver,
John Card, and Ted Kite will cause
quite a scramble in their fight for the
remaining guard position.
Termed as good as Walte Heinecke,
Stanford's great pivot man of three
years ago, Leland Blanchard. graduate
from the goofs, is a wizard on defense
and needs only to brush up on his
offense. Bill and Charlie Bates, Orval
Van Kirk, Basil Wantzer, and Mar
.Albertson complete the host of cen
ters.
Best Kicker Since Templeton
Under the new scheme of things,
Gordon Campbell, last year's left half,
Stan Anderson, called the best kicker
at Stanford since Dinß Templeton,
John Lipscomb and Jeff Minekler from
the goofs, and Ed Walker appear to
be leading candidates for quarter
back. Campbell looks like the best
bet, but Ed Walker is a comer.
Left half rests between Bob Maentz
and Ken Afflerbaugh chiefly, although
jb Moore and Elzo Van Dellen may
ike strong bids for this job. Ernie
addel should have little trouble in
holding his post at right half. He
should rate as one of the best halves
on the coast this fall. Tom Lambert,
Caddel's sub from last year, will re
turn, and with Jack Beach from the
frosh and Bill Spencer from the goofs,
Warner will not need to worry about
replacements there.
Football men wax enthusiastic about
Jack Hillman at fullback. Some claim
that he will make a second Nevers.
He can do everything—hits like a
locomotive on both offense and de
fense, passes well, blocks like a vet

eran, and kicks superbly. In addition j
to all this, the kid brother of last 1
year's Indian captain is fast. Dusty J
Allen, Paul Targhetta, Jack Hancock, .
and Phil Baker will sub for this
position.

and needs only to brush up on his
offense. Bill and Charlie Bates, Orval
Van Kirk, Basil Wantzer, and Mar
.Albertson complete the host of cen

Best Kicker Since Templeton
Under the new scheme of things,
Gordon Campbell, last year's left half,
Stan Anderson, called the best kicker
at Stanford since Dinß Templeton,
John Lipscomb and Jeff Minekler from
the goofs, and Ed Walker appear to
be leading candidates for quarter
back. Campbell looks like the best
bet, but Ed Walker is a comer.
Left half rests between Bob Maentz
and Ken Afflerbaugh chiefly, although
jb Moore and Elzo Van Dellen may
ike strong bids for this job. Ernie
addel should have little trouble in
holding his post at right half. He
should rate as one of the best halves
on the coast this fall. Tom Lambert,
Caddel's sub from last year, will re
turn, and with Jack Beach from the
frosh and Bill Spencer from the goofs,
Warner will not need to worry about
replacements there.
Football men wax enthusiastic about
Jack Hillman at fullback. Some claim
that he will make a second Nevers.
He can do everything—hits like a
locomotive on both offense and de
fense, passes well, blocks like a vet

eran, and kicks superbly. In addition j
to all this, the kid brother of last 1
year's Indian captain is fast. Dusty J
Allen, Paul Targhetta, Jack Hancock, .
and Phil Baker will sub for this
position.
With campus track cxcitement out
of the way, let's wander and think
of this fall's varsity. There will be
eighteen lettermen back, 'ncluding
five regulars. The goof and last year's
frosh squad have good, although un
tried, material to offer.
The schedule starts on September
17 and closes with an intersectional
game with Pittsburgh on the latter's
field November 26. The new men will
tell the story of the '32 season team,
for a nucleus of five regulars will
need better men thaif the spring
practice showed if the team is to go
through the season undefeated.
Pop Changes Strategy
Spring quarter l'odtball indicated
that Pop Warner, Indian mentor, has
abandoned "C" formation, that he will
not use the double fullback and make
the quarter a ball-packer as well as
a blocker, and that he has changed
his "shift."
The Indians lost ' few outstanding
players from the 1931 team by gradu
ation for the simple reason that they
had very few. A! Norgard, Mike Rey
nolds, and Phil Neill, tl very
capable end substitutes, will ot re
turn, but this should not \vorr>
the reason follows —Don Colvi.
Doub, Jay Tod, Thorny Rodgers,

Buchanan, and Dick Philippi will bt
on hand. Philippi looked like a winner
for an end position last spring.
Blanchard Another Heinecke
The tackle problem may be solved
by two boys whose names won't fit
into headlines, Ben Palamountain and
Ed Lettunich. Ben was on the varsity
squad last year but didn't compete
and Ed sparkled in the 1931 frosh
line. Both of these boys are big, rough,
and tough, and have the inside track
for the jobs. Chuck Ehrhorn and Red
Hand graduated, but George Grey,
Red Gribben, Henri Laborde, Jack
Holwerda, Phil Johnston, Nellie Gray,

and Chuck Prelsnik will answer to
the roll call.
Bill Corbus will "return to take over
his guard position and should cause
Indian opponents plenty of trouble;
Bill is the > coast's leading Ail-Ameri
can candidate. Hulen, Heiser, and
Dawson will be gone but Windy
Bigelow, Fred Scribner, John Pilot
tram, Runston Maino, Bruce Tarver,
John Card, and Ted Kite will cause
quite a scramble in their fight for the
remaining guard position.
Termed as good as Walte Heinecke,
