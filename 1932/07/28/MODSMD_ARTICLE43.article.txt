# COAST FOOTBALL APPROVES RADIO
## Conference Votes To Retain Game Broadcasts 
### 
Football games will be broadcast this (
fall.
Professor William Owen of Stanford, :
president of the Pacific Coast Athletic
Conference, Tuesday gave this news to
fans who cannot get to all the games.
"Radio-broadcasting is on trial. We
are anxious to do everything possible ;
to build a constructive permanent pro
gram," he said.
"If the games were conducted on a j
purely commercial basis, we should
have no hesitancy in eliminating (he j
broadcast. However, all of the Pacific j
Conference members have expressed a J
desire to maintain every device to j
stimulate interest and to promote good ;
will."
Don Liebendorfer, publicity director
for the Board of Athletic Control,
added that it has always been Stan- !
ford's policy to broadcast games for |
the benefit of the shut-ins and others j
unable to attend.
