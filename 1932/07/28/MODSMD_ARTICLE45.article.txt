## 
### 
Although they failed to make the
| United States team, three U.S.C. ath
; letes will participate in the Olympic !
J track and field meet, but they will !
! represent other countries.
Pete Chlentzos, Bill Graber's team- ■
mate in the pole vault, is expected to J
join the Greek team. Although he was |
born in this country, his birth took j
place before his parents were natural- i
ized, so he will be eligible to wear the j
Grecian emblem.
j Duncan McNaughton, one of U.S.C.'s j
great trio of high-jumpers, is a resi-
I dent of Vancouver, and will qualify
. for the Canadian team if he can clear i
j 6 feet 3 inches. As he has gone higher j
iin several meets already this season, j
Ihe is regarded as a certainty for the j
I Mapleleaf squad.
George Navarro is the official repm- j
j sentative for Ecuador in the Tenth !
I Olympiad. Navarro is a 400-meter man,
j and may prove to be a surprise in the
I Games meet, as he has often run that
distance in less than 50 seconds on poor !
tracks in his native country.
