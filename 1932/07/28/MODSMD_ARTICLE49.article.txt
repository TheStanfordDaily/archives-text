# U.C.L.A. Protests 10-Year Stadium Lease For U.S.C.
## 
### 
Formal protest against the proposed
I 10-year lease of the Olympic Stadium
! for exclusive use of the University of
I Southern California has been filed with
the Los Angeles city council by S. W.
, Cunningham, athletic director of
j U.C.L.A.
The Bruins have long resented the
i preference given to the Trojans in use
j of the stadium, and they feel that pros
l pects for U.C.L.A. athletics during the
next 10 years ara as good as U.S.C.'s,
J and warrant equal privileges.
As a concluding argument, Cunning
ham points out that U.C.L.A. beat St.
â€” ary's, Ihe team that beat the Trojans,
j and so how does U.S.C. rate so high?
j The answer is now up to the ctiy
council.
