# Student Near Death In Joke John Anderton Faces Chinese Firing-Squad Rescued By Sow And Piglets
## 
### 
The pale-yellow moon, like a round
Chinese lantern, shines down upon a
Ching Wang Tao courtyard, where a
firing squad of Chinese soldiers insert
cartridges into battered rifles.
Suddenly an officer, unkempt and
wearing tortoise-shell glasses, barks a
command.
The tattered soldiers lift their guns
and point them at a figure, fifteen feet ;
away, who stands before a white- !
washed wall. To the victim's left is a
tiny quince tree. A bloody corpse lies j
under it.
The officer takes off his glasses, :
blows upon them, polishes the lenses :
with a red handkerchief. Then he
shrieks, '"Aim!" and the rifles are
leveled at the victim's heart.
The figure in front of the white- (
washed wall stirs nervously ....
Stanford Student Is "Victim"
Of all the pictures he has seen, this j
one is the most vivid in the memory •
of John Anderton, 21-year-old vaga
bond adventurer, who is now a junior !
at Stanford.
Anderton has gazed with awe at the !
Mona Lisa. He has watched the sun i
set on the Taj Majal in India. But this j
episode in a Ching Wang Tao court
yard he can never forget. It is im- ,
pressed indelibly on his mind.
He was the "victim" who stood be- j
fore the whitewashed wall. He ex-,
perienced the adventure in a trip |
through the Orient three years ago.
"After several days knocking about j
Peiping," he recollects, "I decided to
investigate rumors of civil war. That's
how it began. In defiance to all advice -
and warning, I pushed on to the dirty i
little town of Ching Wang Tao, about j
200 miles south of Peiping, and en- ;
countered no disturbing circumstances. ;
Then it all came at once.
Fighting Starts Outside Hotel
"It was just after dinner. I was en
joying a smoke in the best hotel the
little village offered. Suddenly a ter
rific explosion almost annihilated the |
courtyard before my eyes. Bullets sang j
by, some uncomfortably close."
Piushing from the hotel Anderton j
fought his way through the yelling, I

I smelling mass of humanity in the
! street, and dived tor cover.
"But it was too late," he continues,
i "I had been seen. Every soldier within
J sight emptied his rifle in my direction.
; Fortunately," they were bad shots. I
I was dragged out from the once pic
: turesque temple in which I had sought
safety. This was fortunate. A moment
later it disappeared in splinters as a
well-aimed shell from the opposing
i faction demolished it.
"In vain I argued. But my captors
; understood no English. It was useless."
Makes Linguistic Mistake
Then Anderton made the fatal mis
i take. He had learned the Japanese
language in a San Francisco school.
And now he tried to offer explanations
I to a Chinaman in Japanese.
l The bombardment had entii'ely
ceased. But the moment he uttered the
! fiist Japanese word, the Chinamen be
j gan a shrill sing-song which rose to
; a screaming crescendo. Anderton need
led no interpreter to know what that
f meant. He was promptly marched to
j the whitewashed wall.
"To me it was the acme of reality,"
; Anderton says. "Later I discovered
j they were indulging in a little inno-
I cent practical joke. But I was too badly
i frightened then to attempt any remote
j show of nonchalance.
j "I was conscious only of the quince
, trees and the corpse under it, and the
| rifles leveled at my heart.
"Rescue" Effected
"The critical moment had arrived.
Suddenly, through the entranceway to
j the courtyard, a sow and a litter of
six or seven pigs pushed their way and
I made for a pile of debris. That was
jmy 'resctie' party.
"Immediately the soldiers broke
rank, captured the porkers, and in
! complete disregard of me, set about
J preparing for a feast.
"Later the officer with the tortoise
shell glasses came up to me, grinning,
and asked in perfect English if I
j wouldn't care to join him at the barbe-
I cue.
"Needless to say, I did, amid rau
| cous, hysterical shrieks of laughter
' from the soldiers."

Peiping," he recollects, "I decided to
investigate rumors of civil war. That's

little town of Ching Wang Tao, about j
200 miles south of Peiping, and en- ;

Fighting Starts Outside Hotel
"It was just after dinner. I was en
joying a smoke in the best hotel the
little village offered. Suddenly a ter
rific explosion almost annihilated the |
courtyard before my eyes. Bullets sang j
by, some uncomfortably close."
Piushing from the hotel Anderton j
fought his way through the yelling, I

I smelling mass of humanity in the
! street, and dived tor cover.
"But it was too late," he continues,
i "I had been seen. Every soldier within
J sight emptied his rifle in my direction.
; Fortunately," they were bad shots. I
I was dragged out from the once pic
: turesque temple in which I had sought
safety. This was fortunate. A moment
later it disappeared in splinters as a
well-aimed shell from the opposing
i faction demolished it.
"In vain I argued. But my captors
; understood no English. It was useless."

Then Anderton made the fatal mis
i take. He had learned the Japanese
language in a San Francisco school.
And now he tried to offer explanations
I to a Chinaman in Japanese.
l The bombardment had entii'ely
ceased. But the moment he uttered the
! fiist Japanese word, the Chinamen be
j gan a shrill sing-song which rose to
; a screaming crescendo. Anderton need
led no interpreter to know what that
f meant. He was promptly marched to
j the whitewashed wall.
"To me it was the acme of reality,"
; Anderton says. "Later I discovered
j they were indulging in a little inno-
I cent practical joke. But I was too badly
i frightened then to attempt any remote
j show of nonchalance.
j "I was conscious only of the quince
, trees and the corpse under it, and the

"The critical moment had arrived.
Suddenly, through the entranceway to
j the courtyard, a sow and a litter of
six or seven pigs pushed their way and
I made for a pile of debris. That was

The pale-yellow moon, like a round
Chinese lantern, shines down upon a
Ching Wang Tao courtyard, where a
firing squad of Chinese soldiers insert
cartridges into battered rifles.
Suddenly an officer, unkempt and
wearing tortoise-shell glasses, barks a
command.
The tattered soldiers lift their guns

away, who stands before a white- !
washed wall. To the victim's left is a
tiny quince tree. A bloody corpse lies j
under it.
The officer takes off his glasses, :
blows upon them, polishes the lenses :

shrieks, '"Aim!" and the rifles are
