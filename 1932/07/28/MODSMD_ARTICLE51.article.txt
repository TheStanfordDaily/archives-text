# NEW VALLEY FOUND BY S.C. PRIEST IN ALASKAN VOLCANO
## 
### 
Father Bernard R. Hubbard of the
University of Santa Clara, who is
known as the "Glacier Priest," has re
turned from Alaska and is resting in
Victoria, B.C.
Father Hubbard, together with '"Red"
Chisholm, former Santa Clara athlete
and now a professor at San Francisco
University, explored many hitherto un
mapped glacial and volcanic regions in
interior Alaska.
Two husky malamute dogs, '"Marge"
and "Katmai," who accompanied the
scientific party, were brought back
with Father Hubbard.
One of the outstanding discoveries
of the expedition was of an "Alaskan
Yoseinite"â€”a huge hidden valley in
the uncharted areas of the Chiginagak
volcano.
