# SPONGES GROW IN ALL SIZES AND COLORS SAY TEXAS PHARMACISTS
## 
### 
Do you prefer your bath sponge in
sky blue or in apple green?
That's not such an absurd question as
one might think, for according to Uni
versity of Texas pharmacists sponges
grow in all shades from pure white
and gray to all colors of the rainbow.
Many Types of Sponges
Sponges are "polymorphous, diplo
blastic, invertebrate animals," and the
majority are marine, only about 30
species growing in fresh water. Sponges
of commercial use represent the .skele
tons of these animals, which vary in
habit of growth and, consequently, in
shape. Some are branched like plants;
others are rose-shaped, fan-shaped,
cup-shaped, or dome-shaped. Their
bodies range in size from that of a
pin -head to over five feet in height.

Sponges inhabit the bottom of the
I sea, where they are fixed to rocks and
j other solid bodies, and are most abun-
I dant in the tropics. Most of the sponges
i used in the United States come from
I the Bahamas and the coast of Florida,
j but the fin,est ones come from Turkish
j waters.
Cultivation Undertaken
The cultivation of sponges has been
I undertaken on an extensive scale,
i Small fragments are cut under water
| from live sponges and are fixed upon
| a sandy ocean bottom by skewers. In
| three years they will grow to sufficient
j size to be marketable.
The Chinese have used the sponge in
the treatment of diseases for thousands
of years, having learned that burnt
sponge contains iodine in the form of
iodides.
