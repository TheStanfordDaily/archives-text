Lecturer Is Author
j Dr. Miller has been a student of i
economic developments in Russia for |
j many years and has published two
| books upon this subject. The first, "The
J Economic Development of Russia, 1905-
j 1914," concerns the historical back
i ground of the revolution. "The New
j Russia" is based upon the author's re
j search during 1929, 1930, 1931.
It was during this period that she
| visited Russia to interview leading |
economists, financiers, and business!
administrators. Dr. Miller's observa- ]
tions and conclusions on this economic j
renaissance were first made public I
I when she gave a series of talks on i
1 Russia for the British Broadcasting !
| Corporation. Sir Bernard Pares and |
jH. G. Wells were among those who I
| sponsored her discussions.
Interested in British Life
j Interested in the critical condition of ,
| British economic life, Dr. Miller re- j
| cently engaged in a special study of j
J methods adopted in London and else- !
j where in England to combat the social |
J deterioration induced by prolonged
i unemployment. She is particularly well !
| informed on the appalling conditions in !
j Liverpool and Lancashire, cities most j
| seriously affected by unemployment.
During the last six years, Dr. Miller
I has been in charge of the financial '
| work of the Department of Commerce |
j in the University of Liverpool. She now i
! holds the bachelor of science and mas- |
j ter of arts degree from the University |
jof Edinburgh and the doctor's degree ]
j from the University of London in the I
J faculty of economics.
