# Talk Describes Life In Corsica
## Geographical Influence Of Island Shown by Blanchard 
### 
An explanation of the effects of geo- !
j graphical and historical conditions on
j "The Modes of Life in Corsica" was |
I the substance of a lecture given in the
i Little Theatre Tuesday evening by Dr.
| Raoul Blanchard. Blanchard, who is a
I professor of geography at Grenoble,'
| France, and exchange professor at j
J Harvard, is prominent in the develop- I
j ment of the new French school of re
( gional geography.
Blanchard pictured the Corsicans as
being of three distinct types, but all
; of them living a primitive life, centered
j around archaic institutions. One type !
lives on the lower slopes of the moun- j
tains; wheat being their one crop. Al- |
ways afraid of invasion, their fortress- |
i like houses are built away from" the I
j sea, and some one of their number !
I stays on guard at all times.
Live On Chestnuts
In the Castagniccia (chestnut tree) j
j region of northeast Corsica the people !
| live on the fruit of that tree. Because :
they get their food gratis, they have i
a great deal of leisure time, which they j
employ in home industries, selling the [
products throughout the island. The j
isolation made possible by the chestnut j
tree has made Castagniccia the center j
of Corsican independence.
A third type of the Corsican people j
practice a regional migration, main- |
taining two villages, one in the upper I
valleys and one on the seashore. In :
the winter, safe from invasion by rea- !
son of the season, they live on the j
beach. In the summer they migrate to
their upper village, where they gather
chestnuts and graze flocks.
Changed Life Modes
During the last half century, the J
i Corsicans, free from invasion, have
i changed their mode of life to a con- .
j siderable extent. The wheat-raising I
! type, once always on the edge of star
i vation, have turned to the raising of j
i citrus fruits for export, and are now ;
the leading group on the island.
On the other hand the Castagniccians, ,
j in an attempt to create a more varied ;
j life, have lost their position of leader- I
1 ship, and are becoming migratory. The \
i people who have settled in the upper |
] valleys are now engaged in raising !
! goats and sheep, and make a good liv- j
! ing exporting cheese.
Dr. Blanchard considers Corsica "an I
I excellent laboratory for geographical j
! research," and predicts it will be very i
interesting to watch during the pres
; ent transition period.
