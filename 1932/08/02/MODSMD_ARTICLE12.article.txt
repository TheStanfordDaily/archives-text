# ROTH TO PRESENT UNIVERSITY STAND TO MENLO COUNCIL
## Opposition To Dog Racing Plan In Menlo Park To Be Voiced Tonight 
### 
Almon E. Roth, comptroller of Stan
ford, will represent the University at
the open meeting of the Menlo Park
city council tonight, when the question
of a permit for dog racing will be dis
cussed. Various religious and social or
ganizations are expected to be present
to support Roth's' stand against any
such concession.
At the meeting of the council last
week three Menlo Park residents pre
sented a petition asking for a license
to "conduct an amusement park with
dog racing" at Kuck's picnic grounds
on Oak Grove avenue.
Fomcr Petition Denied
A letter from Roth voicing the Uni
versity's protest was presented at the
meeting, and the city fathers decided
to postpone any action until a public
hearing could be held. A similar pro
posal was turned down several months
ago, but the concession was backed by
different interests. It is rumored that
outside interests are sponsoring the
present petition, however.
While the petitioners argued that
construction and upkeep of a race track
would provide employment for Menlo
Park people, and bring outside money
into town, Roth pointed out that a
large vagrant class would accompany
a racing concession, and that most of
the money taken in at the track would
go to the dog owners and operators of
the "option" jnachines.
Menace to Base Hospital
The comptroller also claimed that Lhe
reputation of Menlo Park would suffer
from such a concession, and lhat it
would be a decided menace to the Uni
versity, junior college, and base hos
pital facilities.
Regarding the University's stand,
Roth stated that Stanford is respon
sible to the parents for the students'
conduct, and would therefore fight
against having a race track, with its
attendant gambling, located so close to
the campus.
