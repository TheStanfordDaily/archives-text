# BILL FOR READINGS SENT TO DRAMATIC CLUB IS CHALLENGED
## 
### 
Samuel French, owner of play copy
rights, has sent a bill for $200 to Sword
and Sandals Club for four readings
given by the organization during the
spring and summer quarters. These
were: "Olympia," "Private Lives, - '
"Road to Rome," and "Truth About
Blaydcs."

It seems to have been the under
standing of Vallejo Gantner, president
of Sword and Sandals, and of James
Sandoe, director of the readings for
the summer quarter, that the copyright
laws were not being violated because
no admission charge was made.
Gantner is taking the matter up with
French, and anticipates that the mis
understanding will be amicably settled.
