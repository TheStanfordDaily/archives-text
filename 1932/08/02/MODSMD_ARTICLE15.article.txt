# Fraulein, Co-ed Compared Conventions Don't Bother German Students War Blasted False Modesty
## 
### 
The American flapper is a good
| sport. Yet should she overstep the
I boundaries of convention she would be
! ostracized.
Thus does Bernhardt Springer, Ber
-1 li 11 University graduate now at Stan
i ford, deplore the status of the morals
of American youth.
"There is more freedom in Europe,"
j he says. "The German fraulein, flaxen-
J haired and buxom, is different from her
! American sister. For though she may
! dance to the old-fashioned strains of
( an Oscar Strauss waltz, she is free.
Conventions mean nothing to her."
No Chaperones Needed
Describing the freedom of German
girls, Springer says it is a common oc
currence foi J a German youth to go up
! to a German girl and say, "Fraulein, I
1 am driving down to the Spa for the
week-end. Would you like to go with
me?" And if the girl cares enough for
the boy's company she will answer
"yes."
t "So they motor down to the Spa,"
! he continues. "No chaperones are
J needed. In fact, chaperones are un
known in Germany. It is purely a pla
tonic friendship. They register in the
same hotel together, but occupy dif-
I ferent rooms. There's nothing dishonor-

Table in that.
"But how Americans gasp when they !
hear of such friendships. What would
jan American girl say if she were ap
proached in this manner? Why, she
{would blush. She might even faint."
The war, he maintains, did away with '
1 false modesty in Germany.
i Can't Flunk German University
j Contrasting the college systems of |
Germany and America, Springer says j
| that the sole purpose of a German i
University is to educate. But it is im- !
j possible for a student to flunk out of a
I German university. Grades aren't
i given. A student comes to class when- j
| ever he wants to. Students don't work
| for A's or B's. They work for an edu- j
i cation.
To enter a university there one must j
j pass the entrance examinations, given !
after graduation from school. The !
j only degree that a German institution j
jof'liigher learning gives corresponds to
| the American Ph.D.
What the student does outside the
j classroom does not concern the fac
ulty. Their private lives are their own.
Springer contrasts this to the rigid
"lockout" system employed in Ameri
| can colleges, where co-eds must re- j
I turn or suffer the consequences.

i ford, deplore the status of the morals
of American youth.
"There is more freedom in Europe,"
j he says. "The German fraulein, flaxen-
J haired and buxom, is different from her
! American sister. For though she may
! dance to the old-fashioned strains of
( an Oscar Strauss waltz, she is free.
Conventions mean nothing to her."
No Chaperones Needed
Describing the freedom of German
girls, Springer says it is a common oc
currence foi J a German youth to go up
! to a German girl and say, "Fraulein, I
1 am driving down to the Spa for the
week-end. Would you like to go with
me?" And if the girl cares enough for
the boy's company she will answer
"yes."
t "So they motor down to the Spa,"
! he continues. "No chaperones are
J needed. In fact, chaperones are un
known in Germany. It is purely a pla
tonic friendship. They register in the
same hotel together, but occupy dif-
I ferent rooms. There's nothing dishonor-

Table in that.
"But how Americans gasp when they !
hear of such friendships. What would
jan American girl say if she were ap
proached in this manner? Why, she
{would blush. She might even faint."
The war, he maintains, did away with '
1 false modesty in Germany.
i Can't Flunk German University
j Contrasting the college systems of |
Germany and America, Springer says j
| that the sole purpose of a German i
University is to educate. But it is im- !
j possible for a student to flunk out of a
I German university. Grades aren't
i given. A student comes to class when- j
| ever he wants to. Students don't work
| for A's or B's. They work for an edu- j
i cation.
To enter a university there one must j
j pass the entrance examinations, given !
after graduation from school. The !
j only degree that a German institution j
jof'liigher learning gives corresponds to
| the American Ph.D.
What the student does outside the
j classroom does not concern the fac
ulty. Their private lives are their own.
Springer contrasts this to the rigid
"lockout" system employed in Ameri
| can colleges, where co-eds must re- j
I turn or suffer the consequences.
The American flapper is a good
| sport. Yet should she overstep the
I boundaries of convention she would be
! ostracized.
