# DOOM PRONOUNCED ON CAMPUS PINES, CYPRESS, BY BUGS
## 
### 
"Practically all of the older
Monterey Pines and Cypress on
the Stanford campus are dying,"
Dr. 11. E. Burke, government en
tomologist, declared today. "It is
estimated that 95 per cent of the
trees are doomed, although the
Coulter Pines will survive for
some time yet."
Subnormal rainfall during the
past ten years has been advanced
as the reason for this fatal attack
from a devastating variety of in
sects.
Monterey, a country consider
ably damp, is the home of these
trees. Dr. Burke holds that the
destruction of the campus trees is
too far advanced for salvation.
