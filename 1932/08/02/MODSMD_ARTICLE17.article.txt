# 'Opera Due To Change'-Downes
## Critic Points To Decline Of Gigli And Lily Pons 
### 
That opera is not dead but merely
approaching a new era was evinced
by Olin Downes in his lecture on "The
Operatic Crisis" Monday afternoon.
The ultimate test of opera is its appeal
to the largest possible number of peo
ple, and the enthusiasm of its recep
tion, he maintained.

"In these days when youth is de
manding a more informal type of en
tertainment, opera seems due for a
change," Downes stated. "There are
three standards upon which its success
is based—financial, social, and public
interest. And the latter seems to be the
most important at the present time.
Not Born of Crowd
"Opera was not born of the crowd,
but rather of an intellectual develop
ment which was felt by the crowd, al
though not of it. When Verdi began
his amazing career he introduced into
the staid, conventional forms of opera
a new melodic technique which has
since been called the aria, and is the
basis of success for a good many other
wise commonplace operas.
"Later Handel also turned his at
tention toward the commercializing of
opera, along with others of his day,
engaging star singers and writing whole
works in order to display the singer's
ability."
Stars on Wane
But Downes believes the day of the
star singer to be definitely on the
wane, pointing out that the Metropoli
tan Opera Company tore up Gigli's
contract upon his refusal to accept a
reduction of salary along with the rest
of the singers.

"Although Lily Pons drew the largest
crowds of the season in the New York
production of 'Lakme,' which is a sec
ond-rate but pretty opera, still I be
lieve such a precedent will soon be
changed," Downes said.
