Perhaps you lend about Miss (lalinka Khrenfesl in the Daily
several days ago. Miss Ehrenfest is the 21-year-old Dutch 44*1 rl,
liil el 1-I1 ik i iif* her way around America, who is not afraid to he
picked up by strange men, and who maintains thai "it's not dis
graceful or- improper for a 14ii*l to 'bum.' "
And although the youth of America is superior financially,
il is inferior to European youth in liberal outlook, intense in
terest in current events and international politics. Kuropean
youllis do things.

The city editor of any metropolitan newspaper will (ell you
that I lie majority of his readers think of college as a place
where "kids go to neck, drink gin, and have a good time." That
accounts for the widespread distortion and over-playing of
campus news. 'Hut things are quite different on European eampi.
There people regard the student as a potent force, socially,
morally, politically. They expect the student to do things . . . .
to strike or revolt for a right.

American college students, the majority of them, have long
heen in a mental stupor, indifferent to the social wrongs and
legal miscarriages of justice; content to do nothing about them.
Hut it seems at last that the American collegian is gradually
awakening and becoming aware of his potentialities. News
recently trickled onto the front pages telling how a dozen or so
college students "crashed" a mine strike in Kentucky on a lour
of investigation. They wanted to find out what was behind the
strike.
There was the story of some Vassar girls who appealed to
Congress about an affair in Alabama. They claimed some
negroes hadn't been given a fair trial. And there was another
article about some tniversitv of California students who put
one of their own classmates up for Congress on an independent,
progressive platform.
And so the American student movement is encouraging.
College students here are awakening to the wrongs about them.
Let us hope that in their "awareness" they will be aflame with
the same zealous spirit the French collegians had when they
led the Dreyfus revolt; the same keen thinking that caused
South American students to rebel against dictatorships.
