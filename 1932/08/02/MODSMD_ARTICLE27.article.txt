# AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY
## 
### 
Our first Olympic casualty lias lia]Â»|)ene<l, and it is all the
more tragic because Duncan McNaughlon's victory for* Canada
in tlic high jump might have been America's instead.
In the I.C. 1-A. meet, McNaughton and Jim Stewart, two of
I'.S.C.'s great quartet of high-jumpers, tied for third. As only
three men could (|ualify for the I niled States team trials, a
choice had to he made. Stewart was selected.
Came the tryouts, and Stewart was eliminated when he tied
for eleventh. Came the Olympiad, and McNaughton, now com
peting for Canada, won.
II almost looks as though somebody picked wrong, doesn't it?
