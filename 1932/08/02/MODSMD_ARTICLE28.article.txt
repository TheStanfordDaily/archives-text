# WISH YOU WERE HERE

### 
Cav-eolored picture post cards are pouring into the campus
post office these days. In blatant reds, purples, and greens they
show inviting trout streams, cool, refreshing breakers, or rustic
cabins. And they all bear the legends, "Having a wonderful
lime. Wish you were here."
Our friends, vacationing, pity us, and as I he lilting strains of
:i jazz band invite them to an open-air, pine-scented dancing
pavilion under a full moon, thev add hurriedly lo their picture
post cards, "And it must be tough having to attend classes in
;i summer vacation."
And now, with mid-quarters looming, Ihe old wanderlust
begins to grip us, and we yearn to be with them. They write
about "the outdoor life." (I h-liuh, but bridge starts right after
lunch.) Of the "wholesome, regular diet." (Nerts! Cocktails are
shaken at 1 sharp.) Of the "early hours." (The average dance
doesn't break up until 5 a.m.) Of how "now and then I here is a
parly." (As many as three to five a night.) And how "they're so
informal, you know." (Kvcrvone's there, dressed for a senior
ball.)

They go on to tell vou how "everything is so divinely simple
in the country." (Yet every cabin has a hard-wood floor.) Of
the "rambling lanes." (Concrete boulevards.) And the "natural
primeval wilderness." (Ve-ah-ah! Designed by a landscape
artist.)
Conuuisscratin'? Mavbe. Hut if you received too many bril
liantly colored post cards, reciprocate. Buy scenic views of the
campus. Mail Ihcin back to your friends in their vacation para
discs with the legend, "Stanford I Diversity. Wish you were
