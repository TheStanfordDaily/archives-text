WASHINGTON MASQUERADE — At
the Stanford Theatre.
There is no doubt that Barrymore's
ability to make speeches is of the
highest. And as a fighting, incorruptible
politician who reaches the Senate, the
setting sounds like a "natural." How
ever, even Barrymore cannot do every
thing. Only three things were neglected
by the producers, a good story, compe
tent direction, and a supporting cast.
The story, a supposed "expose* of
corrupt politics, and the undercrust of
capitol society, plays vaguely upon
lobbying activities of the light and
power trusts. With a show of oratorical
bluster, over-lines that are well chosen
for what they leave out, Barrymore
does his best and almost gets away
with it. However, the director let his
one-cylinder production drift into the
melodramatic at times with an effect
which neither bolsters the cast nor
compliments his star.
For Barrymore alone, you should
enjoy this, and Mickey Mouse in
"Barnyard Olympics" will cheer you.

THE TEMPO OF MODERN LIFE—By
James Truslow Adams. A. & C. Boni.
1931» $3. At the Stanford Bookstore.
James Truslow Adams' book, "Our
Business Civilization," has been called
the most quoted book of modern times.
His style of clear diagnosis, apparent
somewhat in his historical works but
restrained by lack of interpretative op
portunities, was at its height in that
volume.
His second book of essays on present
day liying, "The Tempo of Modern
Life," deals with more varied matters
than our economic ills, but retains the
same lucid style. Adams covers a wide
range of subjects, shifting readily from
"Emerson Re-Read" to "Pollyanna,
Our Patron Goddess."
Adams thinks that we are too eager
to serve wealth and machines, and at
limes he assumes an air of cultured
patronage toward his more intellectu
ally plebian readers. For the most part,
however, his book flows along smooth
ly and is easy to follow. It is worth
while reading, but preferably a little
at a time, so as to allow for a thorough
digest for each subject. —N.V.S.

REMAKERS OF MANKIND — By
Carleton Waslihurne. John Day Co.
U)o2. At the Stanford Bookstore.
The experimental school system in
Winnetka, Illinois, is well known to
teachers. Articles have been written
about it, educators have investigated
it, and pedagogues from all parts of
the country, even including Honolulu,
have been sent there on an exchange
basis.
The head of this great experimental
laboratory is Carleton Washburne, a
graduate of Stanford in 1912. After
trying various phases of the teaching
profession, including five years on the

' faculty at San Jose State Teachers
College, Washburne became superin-
J tendent of schools in Winnetka. Since
then he has made a study of European
progressive schools in 1922-23, an in- :
vestigation into the Russian educa- j
tional system in 1927, and a world tour j
;in 1930, under a fellowship of the 1
Julius Rosenwald Fund.
His findings on this last trip consti- i
i tute this book. As he went from coun- j
| try to country Washburne interviewed '
leaders of all classes and professions, |
j asking them such questions as "Are j
you trying to fit boys and girls to the j
i existing society—or to make a new so- ■
J cial order—or to develop each child's
individuality?" and "Will you teach
them internationalism or only loyalty
, to your own nation?"
Thus "Remakers of Mankind" gives
us the views of such leaders as Chang
| Haueh-Liang, war lord, and Hu Shih, |
philosopher, in China; Noguchi, presi
i dent of the New Education Associa
: tion, in Japan; Tagore and Gandhi in
India; King Feisal v of Iraq; Ihsan Bey
| of the Council of Education in Angora;
! Avin Bey, the Turkish translator of
John Dewey; Buknov, the Commis
j sioner of Education in Russia; and
j many other notables in Poland, Ger- 1
, many, France, England, and the United I
States.
Their views are neither one-sided j
' nor unalterably opposed. The results i
! seem to show that the world is not j
moving toward some visionary goal, as I
1 dreamers would have us believe. Fan- j
tastic social, religious, and economic I
credos still hold education in paths of j
propaganda and provincialism.
Washburne's conclusions are not
pessimistic, however. He faces the
problems squarely, without attempting
to color them with his own progressive
ideas. He believes that right training
of our young is the future salvation of
the world, but he realizes that the
conscious goals which are now shaping '
education of world's youth are falling!,
short of the international ideal.
"Our educational thinking and plan- ;
ning," he says in his concluding sen- j
tence, "must be deep-rooted with
realization that equally in the world's I
good is one's own, and in one's own
good is the world's."
"Remakers of Mankind" is primarily
designed for educators, but the stories |
of famous people Washburne met, and
his colorful passages of description |
which crop up every now and then,
make this a book of interest to the
general reader as well. —N.V.S. |

REMAKERS OF MANKIND — By
Carleton Waslihurne. John Day Co.
U)o2. At the Stanford Bookstore.
The experimental school system in
Winnetka, Illinois, is well known to
teachers. Articles have been written
about it, educators have investigated
it, and pedagogues from all parts of
the country, even including Honolulu,
have been sent there on an exchange
basis.
The head of this great experimental
laboratory is Carleton Washburne, a
graduate of Stanford in 1912. After
trying various phases of the teaching
profession, including five years on the

' faculty at San Jose State Teachers
College, Washburne became superin-
J tendent of schools in Winnetka. Since
then he has made a study of European
progressive schools in 1922-23, an in- :
vestigation into the Russian educa- j
tional system in 1927, and a world tour j
;in 1930, under a fellowship of the 1
Julius Rosenwald Fund.
His findings on this last trip consti- i
i tute this book. As he went from coun- j
| try to country Washburne interviewed '
leaders of all classes and professions, |
j asking them such questions as "Are j
you trying to fit boys and girls to the j
i existing society—or to make a new so- ■
J cial order—or to develop each child's
individuality?" and "Will you teach
them internationalism or only loyalty
, to your own nation?"
Thus "Remakers of Mankind" gives
us the views of such leaders as Chang
| Haueh-Liang, war lord, and Hu Shih, |
philosopher, in China; Noguchi, presi
i dent of the New Education Associa
: tion, in Japan; Tagore and Gandhi in
India; King Feisal v of Iraq; Ihsan Bey
| of the Council of Education in Angora;
! Avin Bey, the Turkish translator of
John Dewey; Buknov, the Commis
j sioner of Education in Russia; and
j many other notables in Poland, Ger- 1
, many, France, England, and the United I
States.
Their views are neither one-sided j
' nor unalterably opposed. The results i
! seem to show that the world is not j
moving toward some visionary goal, as I
1 dreamers would have us believe. Fan- j
tastic social, religious, and economic I
credos still hold education in paths of j
propaganda and provincialism.
Washburne's conclusions are not
pessimistic, however. He faces the
problems squarely, without attempting
to color them with his own progressive
ideas. He believes that right training
of our young is the future salvation of
the world, but he realizes that the
conscious goals which are now shaping '
education of world's youth are falling!,
short of the international ideal.
"Our educational thinking and plan- ;
ning," he says in his concluding sen- j
tence, "must be deep-rooted with
realization that equally in the world's I
good is one's own, and in one's own
good is the world's."
"Remakers of Mankind" is primarily
designed for educators, but the stories |
of famous people Washburne met, and
his colorful passages of description |
which crop up every now and then,
make this a book of interest to the
general reader as well. —N.V.S. |

WASHINGTON MASQUERADE — At

There is no doubt that Barrymore's
ability to make speeches is of the
highest. And as a fighting, incorruptible
politician who reaches the Senate, the
setting sounds like a "natural." How
ever, even Barrymore cannot do every
thing. Only three things were neglected
by the producers, a good story, compe
tent direction, and a supporting cast.
The story, a supposed "expose* of
corrupt politics, and the undercrust of
capitol society, plays vaguely upon
lobbying activities of the light and
power trusts. With a show of oratorical
bluster, over-lines that are well chosen
for what they leave out, Barrymore
does his best and almost gets away
with it. However, the director let his
one-cylinder production drift into the
melodramatic at times with an effect
which neither bolsters the cast nor
compliments his star.
For Barrymore alone, you should
enjoy this, and Mickey Mouse in

J cial order—or to develop each child's

us the views of such leaders as Chang

moving toward some visionary goal, as I
1 dreamers would have us believe. Fan- j
tastic social, religious, and economic I
credos still hold education in paths of j
propaganda and provincialism.
Washburne's conclusions are not
pessimistic, however. He faces the
problems squarely, without attempting
to color them with his own progressive
ideas. He believes that right training
of our young is the future salvation of
the world, but he realizes that the
conscious goals which are now shaping '
education of world's youth are falling!,
short of the international ideal.
"Our educational thinking and plan- ;
ning," he says in his concluding sen- j
tence, "must be deep-rooted with
realization that equally in the world's I

good is the world's."
"Remakers of Mankind" is primarily
designed for educators, but the stories |
of famous people Washburne met, and
his colorful passages of description |
which crop up every now and then,
make this a book of interest to the

WASHINGTON MASQUERADE — At
the Stanford Theatre.
There is no doubt that Barrymore's
ability to make speeches is of the
highest. And as a fighting, incorruptible
politician who reaches the Senate, the
setting sounds like a "natural." How
ever, even Barrymore cannot do every
thing. Only three things were neglected
by the producers, a good story, compe
tent direction, and a supporting cast.
The story, a supposed "expose* of
corrupt politics, and the undercrust of
capitol society, plays vaguely upon
lobbying activities of the light and
power trusts. With a show of oratorical
bluster, over-lines that are well chosen
for what they leave out, Barrymore
does his best and almost gets away
with it. However, the director let his
one-cylinder production drift into the
melodramatic at times with an effect
which neither bolsters the cast nor
compliments his star.
For Barrymore alone, you should
enjoy this, and Mickey Mouse in
"Barnyard Olympics" will cheer you.

THE TEMPO OF MODERN LIFE—By
James Truslow Adams. A. & C. Boni.
1931» $3. At the Stanford Bookstore.
James Truslow Adams' book, "Our
Business Civilization," has been called
the most quoted book of modern times.
His style of clear diagnosis, apparent
somewhat in his historical works but
restrained by lack of interpretative op
portunities, was at its height in that
volume.
His second book of essays on present
day liying, "The Tempo of Modern
Life," deals with more varied matters
than our economic ills, but retains the
same lucid style. Adams covers a wide
range of subjects, shifting readily from
"Emerson Re-Read" to "Pollyanna,
Our Patron Goddess."
Adams thinks that we are too eager
to serve wealth and machines, and at
limes he assumes an air of cultured
patronage toward his more intellectu
ally plebian readers. For the most part,
however, his book flows along smooth
ly and is easy to follow. It is worth
while reading, but preferably a little
at a time, so as to allow for a thorough
digest for each subject. —N.V.S.

REMAKERS OF MANKIND — By

The experimental school system in
Winnetka, Illinois, is well known to
teachers. Articles have been written
about it, educators have investigated
it, and pedagogues from all parts of
the country, even including Honolulu,
have been sent there on an exchange
basis.
The head of this great experimental
laboratory is Carleton Washburne, a
graduate of Stanford in 1912. After
trying various phases of the teaching
profession, including five years on the

' faculty at San Jose State Teachers
College, Washburne became superin-
J tendent of schools in Winnetka. Since
then he has made a study of European
progressive schools in 1922-23, an in- :
vestigation into the Russian educa- j
tional system in 1927, and a world tour j
;in 1930, under a fellowship of the 1
Julius Rosenwald Fund.
