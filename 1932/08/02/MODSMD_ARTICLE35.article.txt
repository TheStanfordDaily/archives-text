A SOCIALIST CUKK
i The Editor, Sir:
The struggle of the capitalist class to
! find world markets and investment.
| areas for their surplus goods and capi
tal was a prime cause of the world
war. It is today fostering those policies
of militarism and imperialism which,
;if unchecked, lead to another world
> conflict.
From the poverty, insecurity, cm-
S ployment, economic collapse, and the
| wastes and wars of our present eapital
| istic order, only the united efforts of
1 workers and farmers, organized in
I unions and co-operatives, and above
j all, in a political party of their own,
j can save the nation.
The Republican and Democratic par
j ties, both controlled by the great in
| dustrialists and financiers, have no
plan or program to rescue us from the
j present collapse. In this crisis their
! chief purpose and desife has been tu
j help the railroads, banks, insurance
| companies, and other capitalist inter
j ests. Hoover! Lamont! Rubluv!
The socialist party is today the one
j democratic pal'ty of the workers whose
i program would remove the causes of
j class struggles, class antagonism, and
I social evils inherent in the capitalist
j system. %
It proposes to transfer the principal
j industries of the country from private
j ownership and autocratic, cruelly in
| efficient management to social owner
j ship and democratic control. Only by
j these means will it be possible to or
! ganize our industrial life on a basis of
planned and steady operation without
periodic breakdowns and disastrous
crises. â€”B. Magee
