# FIERY MOUNTS, INTREPID HORSEMEN THRILL FANS AT OLYMPIC GAMES
## 
### Leonard Horwin 
They waltz, jig, circle, hurdle, stand
perfectly still for minutes at a time—
in fact, do everything but gargle mouth
wash.
I refer to the marvelously trained
horses entered in the equestrian events
of the Olympic Games. Combining
circus-horse intelligence with thor
oughbred fire and dash, Olympic Games
entries of five nations put on a pre-
Olympic equestrian carnival before a
huge crowd gathered at the Riviera
Country Club here.
With thousands of visitors on hand
who have treked here from every land
between the Arctic and Antarctic,
dashing military horsemen and splen
did mounts provided a foretaste of the
Olympic Games menu.
Drama Incarnate
Fourteen sports and 135 individual
events during 16 days—the heavy pro
gram of the Tenth Olympic Games.
Nine different stadiums, nine years
of planning started when William May
Garland secured the Games for the
United States in 1923, millions of dol
lars and efforts of thousands expended
in preparing for the show. An entire
village of 550 cottages, 50 kitchens, a
bank, administration building, every
thing to house and cater to the wants
of more than 2000 athletes drawn from
50 nations. Building of this most inter
national village in history began little
more than three months ago. Today it
stands a monument to man's creative
power; while surging thousands of
visitors cluster about it for a glimpse
of the world's athletic heroes.
But soon the village along with a
great part of the Olympic creations will
disappear into history—the tenth repe
tition of what happned 2700 years ago
when ancient Greece began offering

physical perfection as tribute to Zeus,
ruler of heaven and earth.
Each a Miracle
Each event in these Games is a mir- !
: acle of precision. Every detail prepared
j for, watched, checked by men of all •
; the world now thronging Los Angeles, !
| filling it, with a riot of glamour and !
j color and a babel of tongues.
i Think of these equestrian events for
j one of 14 instances. The Japanese team, j
' alone, bringing a globe-trotting stable i
| of 11 horses gathered from the world !
j over and showing infinite training, j
What endurance and exactness these I
i horses entered in the 3-day equitation j
| tournament of the Games Will need. On
I the first day, the 11-minute training ;
i test with 41 precision movements for i
I the horse—each testing years of school- |
i ing and close understanding between 1
j man and horse. On the second day, an '
; endurance test with perfect timing de
manded over a 22Va mile cross-country j
j course, including 35 jumps of every |
| description over terrain as rough as j
j ever caused a Western cowpuncher's
j mount to curse its lot. On the third.
: day, a 12-obstacle course with ditches,!
i water hazards, every device to test the j
| staying power of horse and man.
j As picturesque a layout as a Swiss j
| hamlet, the Riviera Country Club, j
' scene of the 1932 equestrian events is '
| cradled in hills overlooking the sea. A
l short distance away, suggestions of the !
Greek Olympic theme will be found j
' in the famous open-air Greek Theatre J
jin Hollywood Hills where dramatic j
and musical genius will delight the ear i
| of the Olympic visitor.

Speaking of Equestrian Events

Speaking of horses, Dr. Theodore
Schmidt, head of the late-arrived Aus
trian team, promises the horse-laugh
on those who imagine Old Man De
pression can wither the Olympic spirit.
Coming to Los Angeles in spite of
every obstacle, the nine-man Austrian
team ranges in rank all the way from
Prince Ferdinand von und zu Leich
tenstein, etc., handsome speed demon

and African explorer, to Nieholaus .
Hirschl, Vienna butcher and heavy- j
weight wrestling champ. Youngest of ,
the Austrians is a student, Hans Riedl,
winner of all German and Austrian :
trophies in six-meter yachting. Hans i
will compete with some 25 white swal- j
lows of the waves in the no-admission -
charge events to be run off from Au
gust 7 to 12 on a course in full view of |
Catalina Island. The Hermosa Hotel I
and cottages on the island gem itself,

With thousands of visitors on hand
who have treked here from every land
between the Arctic and Antarctic,
dashing military horsemen and splen

Olympic Games menu.
Drama Incarnate
Fourteen sports and 135 individual
events during 16 days—the heavy pro
gram of the Tenth Olympic Games.
Nine different stadiums, nine years
of planning started when William May
Garland secured the Games for the
United States in 1923, millions of dol
lars and efforts of thousands expended
in preparing for the show. An entire
village of 550 cottages, 50 kitchens, a
bank, administration building, every
thing to house and cater to the wants
of more than 2000 athletes drawn from
50 nations. Building of this most inter
national village in history began little
more than three months ago. Today it
stands a monument to man's creative
power; while surging thousands of
visitors cluster about it for a glimpse
of the world's athletic heroes.
But soon the village along with a
great part of the Olympic creations will
disappear into history—the tenth repe
tition of what happned 2700 years ago
when ancient Greece began offering

physical perfection as tribute to Zeus,
ruler of heaven and earth.

Speaking of Equestrian Events

Speaking of horses, Dr. Theodore
Schmidt, head of the late-arrived Aus
trian team, promises the horse-laugh
on those who imagine Old Man De
pression can wither the Olympic spirit.
Coming to Los Angeles in spite of
every obstacle, the nine-man Austrian
team ranges in rank all the way from
Prince Ferdinand von und zu Leich
tenstein, etc., handsome speed demon

and African explorer, to Nieholaus .
Hirschl, Vienna butcher and heavy- j
weight wrestling champ. Youngest of ,
the Austrians is a student, Hans Riedl,
winner of all German and Austrian :
trophies in six-meter yachting. Hans i
will compete with some 25 white swal- j
lows of the waves in the no-admission -
charge events to be run off from Au
gust 7 to 12 on a course in full view of |
Catalina Island. The Hermosa Hotel I
and cottages on the island gem itself,
overlooking Avalon Bay, are receiving ;
droves of visitors and yachtsmen.
They waltz, jig, circle, hurdle, stand
perfectly still for minutes at a time—
in fact, do everything but gargle mouth
wash.
I refer to the marvelously trained
horses entered in the equestrian events
of the Olympic Games. Combining
circus-horse intelligence with thor
oughbred fire and dash, Olympic Games
entries of five nations put on a pre-
