# IRRIGATION WATER ODOR SAID TO BE FROM NEW PROJECT
## 
### 
A. L. Trowbridge, assistant comp
troller, says that the peculiar odor of
the irrigation water being used on the
campus is probably due â€¢. to decayed
vegetable matter in the Felt lake reser
voix\
A similar difficulty was experienced
about ten years ago in connection with
the water coming from Searsville lake.
This lake was cleaned, and the outlet
changed to a more favorable posit>n.
Since there has been no further trouble
until this summer, the odor probably
comes from Felt lake, a new project.
Trowbridge added that as soon ;v
the water level in Felt lake is low
enough a complete investigation
be made to determine whether or not
the conditions warrant any work.
