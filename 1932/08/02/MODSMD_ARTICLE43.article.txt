# DR. LUTZ COMMENTS ON DEVELOPMENTS IN REICH ELECTION
## Hitlerists Victory Indecisive; Communist Party Gains Million Votes 
### 
All eyes turned toward Germany
Sunday, looking for some outstanding
development in political history as
Germany went to the polls in the Na
tional elections to the Reich. Germany
voted, but the results, although inter
esting, were indecisive.
The Hitlerist party gained virtual
control of the government, but with an
insufficient display of strength to pre
sage an overthrow of the German Con
stitution, which Hitler had promised in
the event his party came into power.
National Socialists Win
Despite the fact that a clear major
ity was not gained, the Reich elections
were a great victory for the National
Socialistic Party, in the opinion of Dr.
Ralph Haswell Lutz, history professor
at Stanford.
Sunday's election marked the over
throw of the People's, or Liberal Party
and the State, or Democratic Party by
the Nazis. The Socialists lost GOO,OOO
votes, presumably to the Communists,
who gained nearly a million. Dr. Lutz
inteprets these figures as indicating
that the Fascists will be unable to
make any further progress against the
Socialists and Communists.
"It is probable," Dr. Lutz stated,
"that in the immediate future the con
trol will be in the hands of the parties
of the Right."
Lists Probabilities
Based on reports from the German
newspapers which have arrived at
Stanford to date, Dr. Lutz foresees the
following as possible alternatives which
may be adopted in the German ad
ministration:
1. The Nazis will control the govern
ment with the consent of the other
parties;
2. A government will be formed in
the Right coalition with the consent of
the other parties; or
3. There will be a coalition of the
Right-Center, in which case there will
be a government with a clear majority.
It is Dr. Lutz's opinion that the
present non-partisan captain, Von
Papen, will continue to be in power
under a dictatorship, backed by both
President von Hindenburg and the
Reichstag. "It will be remembered."
Dr. Lutz pointed out, "that the old
Reichstag was called together but six
times; so a government of this type will
be nothing new for Germany."
