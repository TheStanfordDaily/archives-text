# NELLIE GRAY TAKES FIFTH IN OLYMPICS FINALS, PUTS 50'9"
## Harlow Rothert Takes Second To Sexton, Who Tosses Shot 52'6" 
### 
Leo Sexton first, Harlow Rothert sec-
I ond, Douda, Hirchtield, and Nellie
I Gray finishing in that order and the
Star Spangled Banner waved as three
Americans won the first field event
of the 19152 Olympic Games.
Leo Sexton, Irish American of New
York, broke the world's record with ;«
j put of over 52 feet (> inches, but the
interesting angle was in Harlow Rotli
ert's fight for second. Not that Harlow
scaled great heights to take his second,
for this was not the case—he has done
much better than 51 feet 5 inches.
Rolhert Comes Through
This year when Rothert announced
that he was going to bid for a place
on Uncle Sam's Olympic team, sports
editors gave him an outside chance
against Sexton, Gray, Rhea, and Brix,
rating him a "has-been." Stanford fans
have seen Harlow come through before.
Nellie Gray put the shot 50 feet 9
inches to place fifth. Gray has next
year to compete at Stanford and a po
tential record-breaker —but if Douda
or Sexton should get off one of their
53 feet plus puts in a meet, the record
will be on ice for some time.
The 100-meter dash was a thriller.
| After two false starts, Tolan got away
J into the lead with Yoshioka of Japan
I at his shoulder.
Tolan Gets Verdict
The field was inches behind but, To
lan was unchallenged after the 75-
meter marker as the Japanese sprinter
ran himself out aboul this distance.
The great Metcalfe, with a burst of
! .speed, caught Tolan at 95 meters and
i the two broke the tape almost simul
j tancously—the judges giving Tolan a
j 2-inch verdict.
Jonath of Germany and Simpson of
j America finished ahead of the 1928
(champion, Percy Williams of Canada,
! who was never in the race.
Dr. Patrick O'Callaghan took three
i throws to win on his last from Yrola
! of Finland in the hammer. The giant
j Irishman won at the 1928 games with a
1 throw 6 feet short of this year's mark
i of 176 feet 11% inches.
