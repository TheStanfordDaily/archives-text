# STANFORD PARALYZED IN PANIC OF '93 Blue Bloods Sacrificed On Auction Block PRIZE STABLE AIDS SCHOOL FINANCES
## 
### 
The thundering hoofs of proud horses
echo through Stanford's history—sleek,
clean-limber animals that brightened
Leland Stanford's last days at his fam
ous Palo Alto stock farm.
Many blue ribbons, many track
awards these animals won. But it would
have pleaded Senator Stanford to know
that their greatest victory was won a
few years after his death when, manes
flung defiantly to the wind, they wen)
on the auction block in an attempt to
help save the University.
Play Important Role
During the years 1893 and 1896 the
horses of the Stanford estate played
an important part when the institution
had no income save the allowance
made by the courts to Mrs. Stanford
'for her personal servants.
Leland Stanford died June 22, 1893,
just two years after the establishment
of the University. The estate fell into
the hands of the courts; the will was
in probate. And the debts of the estate
had to be paid.
Then came the panic of 1893. Salaries
were not paid, incomes from business
had ceased. Even great corporations
had no ready visible income. Dr. David
Starr Jordan said at that time that
from many points of view it seemed
best to close the University until the
estate was settled, the debts paid, and
the panic had run its course.
Horses; Are Saciiliced
And as one of the resources, in a
desperate attempt to keep the Univer
sity going, the horses of the Stanford
stables were sacrificed for a mere pit-f
tance.
Several years before his death, Gov
ernor* Stanford became interested in
horses. Establishing a stock farm at
Palo Alto, he wanted to breed horses
.... "clean-limbed, handsome, intel
ligent, docile, strong, and swift."
Newspapers everywhere heralded it
as the finest breeding establishment in
the world.
"There is only one Palo Alto, said
a New York journal, "and every horse
man who visits California should in
spect the grandest, best-arranged,
most extensive horse-breeding estab
lishment in the world."
Sunol Holds Record
Sunol, developed on the Stanford
track, was the world's fastest two-year
old. The horse Palo Alto held the
world's stallion record.
But Leland Stanford's death and the
panic hit the University hard. Mrs.
Stanford's own fortune was in the es
tate. She had nothing of her own save
the community property, and that could
not be hers until the debts and legacies
had been completed. The total sum
amounted to $8,000,000.
"In normal times," Dr. Jordan said,
"there was hardly enough money in
California to pay this amount. But
these were not normal times, and there
was no money in California to pay
anything."
The very existence of Stanford was
at stake. And as one means of securing
revenue, the horses were sold.
Colts Sold Cheaply
Colts worth thousands brought only
$50 a head. Electricity, for whom Stan
ford had refused $25,000 six months
before, was sacrificed at $2,000.
But the "handsome, clean-limbed,
intelligent, strong, and swift" animals

had helped save the University from
oblivion.
At a Founders' Day ceremony in
1917, Dr. Jordan paid them the follow
ing tribute:
"We should keep in mind always the
horses that saved Stanford, even as the
Humans keep in mind the geese that
saved their cily."
Jordan Plants Trees
He then planted two redwood trees
near the original site of the stable,
where several of the horses are buried.
The redwoods were to "stand as silent
sentinels after the graves of the horses
will be obliterated and the tombstones
crumpled to dust."
Dr. Jordan maintained that the motto
of the University is "Die luft der freheit
velit" .... "May the winds of freedom
blow." And by the same token planted
these trees, in whose branches the
winds of freedom continue to blow,
stately monuments to the horses who
helped save the University.

oblivion.
At a Founders' Day ceremony in
1917, Dr. Jordan paid them the follow
ing tribute:
"We should keep in mind always the
horses that saved Stanford, even as the
Humans keep in mind the geese that
saved their cily."
Jordan Plants Trees
He then planted two redwood trees
near the original site of the stable,
where several of the horses are buried.
The redwoods were to "stand as silent
sentinels after the graves of the horses
will be obliterated and the tombstones
crumpled to dust."
Dr. Jordan maintained that the motto
of the University is "Die luft der freheit
velit" .... "May the winds of freedom
blow." And by the same token planted
these trees, in whose branches the
winds of freedom continue to blow,
stately monuments to the horses who
helped save the University.
The thundering hoofs of proud horses
echo through Stanford's history—sleek,
clean-limber animals that brightened
Leland Stanford's last days at his fam
ous Palo Alto stock farm.
Many blue ribbons, many track
awards these animals won. But it would
have pleaded Senator Stanford to know
that their greatest victory was won a
few years after his death when, manes
flung defiantly to the wind, they wen)
on the auction block in an attempt to
help save the University.
Play Important Role
During the years 1893 and 1896 the
horses of the Stanford estate played
an important part when the institution
had no income save the allowance
made by the courts to Mrs. Stanford
'for her personal servants.
Leland Stanford died June 22, 1893,
just two years after the establishment
of the University. The estate fell into
the hands of the courts; the will was
in probate. And the debts of the estate
had to be paid.
Then came the panic of 1893. Salaries
were not paid, incomes from business
had ceased. Even great corporations
had no ready visible income. Dr. David
Starr Jordan said at that time that
from many points of view it seemed
best to close the University until the
estate was settled, the debts paid, and
the panic had run its course.
Horses; Are Saciiliced
And as one of the resources, in a
desperate attempt to keep the Univer
sity going, the horses of the Stanford
stables were sacrificed for a mere pit-f
tance.
Several years before his death, Gov
ernor* Stanford became interested in
horses. Establishing a stock farm at
Palo Alto, he wanted to breed horses
.... "clean-limbed, handsome, intel
ligent, docile, strong, and swift."
Newspapers everywhere heralded it
as the finest breeding establishment in
the world.
"There is only one Palo Alto, said
a New York journal, "and every horse
man who visits California should in
spect the grandest, best-arranged,
most extensive horse-breeding estab
lishment in the world."
Sunol Holds Record
Sunol, developed on the Stanford
track, was the world's fastest two-year
old. The horse Palo Alto held the
world's stallion record.
But Leland Stanford's death and the
panic hit the University hard. Mrs.
Stanford's own fortune was in the es
tate. She had nothing of her own save
the community property, and that could
not be hers until the debts and legacies
had been completed. The total sum
amounted to $8,000,000.
"In normal times," Dr. Jordan said,
"there was hardly enough money in
California to pay this amount. But
these were not normal times, and there
was no money in California to pay
anything."
The very existence of Stanford was
at stake. And as one means of securing
revenue, the horses were sold.
Colts Sold Cheaply
Colts worth thousands brought only
$50 a head. Electricity, for whom Stan
ford had refused $25,000 six months
before, was sacrificed at $2,000.
But the "handsome, clean-limbed,
intelligent, strong, and swift" animals

had helped save the University from
oblivion.
At a Founders' Day ceremony in
