That half of Stanford's students and
graduates can't figure 10 per cent of
$10 seemed apparent when early checks
for football tickets started to pour into
the B.A.C. offices this week.

Ticket registration cards were sent
out last week, and when they started
to come back it was discovered that
more than half the applicants had mis
calculated the government tax.

The majority naively believed that
10 per cent of $10, the regular price
for two tickets, was 10 cents. Others
figured it variously from 54 cents to
51.10. As a result, about a third of the
applications have to be returned to the
applicants for more money.
In spite of this lack of mathematical
precision, Jake Irwin, ticket manager,
iaid that the requests have been com
ing in fairly well, and thought it is too
early yet to compare this year's sale
with last year's, indications are that it
will be about the same.
This pre-registration for football
tickets is open on the U.S.C. game until
September 1, and on the California
game until October 1, but applications
get precedence in the order in which
they are received.
After these dates all special ticket
privileges that faculty, alumni, and stu
dents have are canceled.
