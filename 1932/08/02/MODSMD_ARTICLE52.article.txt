# Postmaster Asks Patience In Receiving Billet-Doux
## 
### 
If you are looking forward to that
check from Dad or that letter from the
girl friend, don't become impatient
when you are forced to wait five or ten
seconds at the general delivery win
dow.
As a part of its effort to balance the
budget the Federal Government has
deemed it necessary to require that all
post office employees take . a 24-day
furlough without pay. At the campus
office the clerks are taking their fur
lough during the summer while the
mail volume is at its lowest ebb. The
absence of these men places extra work
on the shoulders of the remaining em
ployees.
