# Gate Tax To Be Fought By P.C.C.
## College To Test New Levy In Court Trial 
### 
W. B. Owens has returned to the
campus as Western representative of
the test case committee appointed at
the Pacific Coast Conference meeting
in Los Angeles last week.
Questioning the validity of a federal
tax on gate receipts of collegiate ath
letic contests, the Conference voted to
bring to court a test case to , settle
the matter.
Owens, professor of law at Stanford
and president of the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Athletic Conference, says
that although the colleges are reluc
tant to appear as opposing the raising
of necessary revenue for the govern
ment in these times, they based their
decision upon the fear that it may lead
to other burdens on education.
No Precedent For Tax
"I believe this is the first time in
our history," declared Owens, "that
any attempt has been made to tax
educational revenues and impose upon
educational institutions the expense of
collecting taxes, or other governmental
burdens."
The cost of tax collection, as it will
make changing money a much more
intricate and expensive transaction, in
volving more time, men, and booths,
will almost equal the present overhead
in the sale of tickets at the games.
Another question arises as to how
much the tax will reduce the total
revenue. Less people are expected to
attend as the price advances.
Principle Important
If the state universities should prove
exempt due to state's rights, then dif
ficulties will arise when California
meets Stanford in the Big Game, and
in other similar situations throughout
the country.
"This first attempt toward taxing
educational revenues involves a prin
ciple apart from the merits of this
particular tax, which is of far-reaching
importance and should be definitely
determined," Owens concluded.
