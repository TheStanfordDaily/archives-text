# Byron's Chillon Poem Amiss "Playboy Poet" Gave Prisoner X-Ray Peepers Archie Andrew Explores Cell

### THEODOR DIERKS 
Lord Byron, the "Glorious Apollo,"
may have written a great poem when
he gave the world the "Prisoner of
Chillon," but, according lo Archie W. i
Andrew, summer student, Byron must j
have equipped his "prisoner" with X- J
ray eyes the day ho looked out of his !
cell-window and saw "the blue Rhone j
in fullest flow," and the "white-wall'd I
distant town."
Andrew was a student last year at
Chillon College, which is about 100
yards from the Chateau de Chillon. j
Being so close to the place, he was in
j terested in the poem and its setting, i
and often went down into the dungeon :
j where Byron had his man moaning 1
! and groaning about his evil fate.
Many times, after reading about the
I "blue Rhone in fullest flow," and the i
j "white wall'd distant town," Andrew
| would climb up to the small window in j
I the dungeon and attempt to view the
! same tempting vista that the "prisoner" â– 

had.
Unfortunately for both the student j
and the "prisoner" all that could be <
seen, after neck-twistings and much
calisthenics, was the blue, blue sky. i
i Of course if one possessed X-ray eyes ]
j one need not climb to the window and j
'all the exercises performed on the sill |
j would be for naught, for all the pos- !
] sessor of the peculiar eyes must do '
i would be to glance through the stone /
and gaze at all he wished.
Another discrepancy in the poem j
I noted by Andrew was that the Chateau i
: de Chillon is on Lake Geneva, and not i
ion "Lake Leman." Byron also men-j
; lions that this "Lake Leman by Chil- !
lon's walls" is 1000 feet in depth. An
j drew believes this to be another in
stance of the poet's license, for he
i stands 5 feet, 7 inches tall, has gone !
swimming in the near vicinity of the i
! Chateau, and, when swimming, touched i
j bottom. He can't "fathom" that 1000-
j foot depth.
