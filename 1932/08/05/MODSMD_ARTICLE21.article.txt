# FINANCIAL CRISIS MAY STOP PLAY, 'ALISONS HOUSE'
## Dramatic Council To Canvass Campus For Advance Sale Of Play Tickets Director Fears Recurrence Of "Parade" Deficit; Play Set For August 12 
### 
Unless more interest in campus dra
| matics is .shown by the summer quarter
students, "Alison's House," the play in
j rehearsal, will not be given and no
[ provision will be made for play pro
[ duction for next summer, according to
announcement made yesterday by Di
j rector Stover after a conference with
the Dramatic Council.
So few persons attended "Parade,"
the comedy presented in July, that a
large financial deficit resulted. 'Rather
than take the chance of repeating the
experience the Dramatic Council will
call off the second play of the season
and will not attempt any next summer.
Up to Students
A close canvass of the campus and
Palo Alto will be launched tonight to
determine how many people will indi
cate that they will attend the second
play. The results of the survey will be
brought before the council early nexf
week and if enough people have shown
that they will support the play, "Ali
son's House" will be given as sched
uled, Friday evening, August 12.
Failure of summer quarter students
to attend the dramatic activities will
automatically put an end to the thea
tricals.
Excellent Cast Working
"It will be decidedly unfair to the
cast of 'Alison's House who have
been earnestly rehearsing to do away
with the planned performance," Di
rector Stover said yesterday.
"Summer quarter plays have been
produced -regularly almost as long as
Stanford has had a summer quarter,"
Stover continued. "It would be a back
ward step to do away with them now.
"The support given the dramatic
work by off-campus publications has
been excellent, as has that of the Daily.
A number of residents of nearby
towns always attend the plays. If, at
this time, Stanford students refuse to
support their own productions, it will
be an unpleasant commentary on the
University."
