# THE 						SOVIET "INGAGI" OUTPUT.

### 
Miss Margaret Miller, speaking on I lie Five-Year Plan, was
one of those rare authorities who give an unbiased, unprejudiced
report on what Russia is trying to do, how she is trying to do it.
Most of the "enlightening" material that conies out of Russia
today is decidedly prejudiced. Religion and free-love .... that
is the backbone of the Five-Year Plan, according to the average
observer of the Russian experiment.

Perhaps you remember that sensational picture of African
adventure, "Ingagi." In it a native woman was shown being
sacrificed to a huge gorilla. Box-otlice records were smashed,
crowds stood in line. Six months later news leaked out that
the "gorilla" was a Hollywood extra, that the sensational parts
of I lie film had been "shot" in Hollywood.

Most of the news of Russia which reaches capitalist countries
carries this same "Ingagi" flavor, pandering to the masses with
cheap and astounding sensationalism on free-love and religion,
and not commenting upon the agricultural and industrial de
velopments or estimating the successes as well as the failures
of a planned economy.
