Occasionally news writers, apparently for lack of something
better to do, sit down before an open newspaper, read an im
portant story, and select some insignificant angle for develop
ment in tin article which sets forth their own ideas. Often these
sidelight articles contain constructive interpretation of the facts
in the case. Frequently, however, this search for signcd-storv
fodder results in a meaningless hodge-podge which may preju
dice the reader's mind in sympathy with the writer's viewpoint.
Such a hodge-podge resulted from the recent news-ferreting
of Annie Laurie, feature writer for the San Francisco Examiner.
Miss Laurie seized upon'the widely publicized Tcmplelon mur
der case, in which a young California fraternity man is accused
of slaving his aunt and assaulting his uncle. Miss Laurie's
remarks follow:
"That was a nice, friendly, encouraging, sympathetic letter
that Douglas Templeton received from a member of his college
fraternity the other day, wasn't it? This is the letter he received
from a fellow student: 'This is just a short note to let you know
all the fellows are behind you in your misfortune. If there is
any assistance whatsoever that we can give you, don't fail to
call 011 lis.' Charming little letter, isn't it—so full of brotherly
love, and confidence, and implied approval Ah, indeed
well that's encouraging to all the rest of us, who are mere every
day human beings, and don't happen to belong to this particular
fraternity, isn't it? .... Well, well, now isn't that nice
Alibis 1 suppose, and certificates of character, and all the rest
of the miserable subterfuges that hide so nimbly behind the
strictest law 'All the fellows are behind you.' I wonder
j list why. Is anything you do all right as long as you belong to
the right fraternity or the right club? It would be really in
teresting for the rest of us poor outsiders to know, wouldn't it?"
Come now, Annie, you can't really mean all tint. We feel
sure that you really know better. You know that y< ling Tem
pleton's fraternity brothers no more approve his act than does
the Examiner or the Stam ohd Daily. And you know, too, Annie,
that friendship is a mighty lasting bond, whether it occur within
or without fraternal circles. As for "us poor outsiders"—how
about the P.K.0., or is it the Eastern Star? Very few are genu
ninc outsiders. Even today nearly every American Legion man
in the country is up in arms over the unfortunate death of two
of his brothers in Washington, whether lie be in sympathy with
the bonus march, or not. Now really, Annie ....

Occasionally news writers, apparently for lack of something
better to do, sit down before an open newspaper, read an im
portant story, and select some insignificant angle for develop
ment in tin article which sets forth their own ideas. Often these
sidelight articles contain constructive interpretation of the facts
in the case. Frequently, however, this search for signcd-storv
fodder results in a meaningless hodge-podge which may preju
dice the reader's mind in sympathy with the writer's viewpoint.
Such a hodge-podge resulted from the recent news-ferreting
of Annie Laurie, feature writer for the San Francisco Examiner.
Miss Laurie seized upon'the widely publicized Tcmplelon mur
der case, in which a young California fraternity man is accused
of slaving his aunt and assaulting his uncle. Miss Laurie's
remarks follow:
"That was a nice, friendly, encouraging, sympathetic letter
that Douglas Templeton received from a member of his college
fraternity the other day, wasn't it? This is the letter he received
from a fellow student: 'This is just a short note to let you know
all the fellows are behind you in your misfortune. If there is
any assistance whatsoever that we can give you, don't fail to
call 011 lis.' Charming little letter, isn't it—so full of brotherly
love, and confidence, and implied approval Ah, indeed
well that's encouraging to all the rest of us, who are mere every
day human beings, and don't happen to belong to this particular
fraternity, isn't it? .... Well, well, now isn't that nice
