# PROFESSORS GET A CHANCE
## 
### 
College professors have been given jiii opportunity to sliow
whether or not their eeonomie theories will work in practice.
On the Independent Protective Committee for holders of
Kreugcr and Toll dchentures, only one member, Rainhridge
Colby, chairman, is a "hard-headed business man." The rest are
professors from the College of the (lily of New York, Columbia,
Ceorgetown, Harvard, and Pennsylvania.
The Kreuger mess is a lough job for any group to try to
straighten out. If this committee can come through, it will be a
triumph for the "theorists." If the professors fail, they can place
the blame either on Chairman Colby or on some sinister political
influence. Thev can't lose.

Things are so quiet in Los Angeles these'days, say visitors, I
that you can hear an executive (hopped.
