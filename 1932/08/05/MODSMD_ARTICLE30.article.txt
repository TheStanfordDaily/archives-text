### 
THE CAT AND TIIE FIDDLE—At the
Outran Theatre, San Francisco.
Various people look for various
things in a musical play. Some want
superb singing; some, good acting;
a perfect plot; some, excellent
directing; some, sparkling dialogue. And
then there are some who want all of
these wrapped up in one performance.
They can get it in this operetta, "The
Cat and the Fiddle."
The music is splendid. Helen Gaha
gan, Paul Gregory, Olga Baclanova, and
Sam Ash have singing leads which of
fer them excellent vehicles for their
rich voices, and a well-balanced andi
powerful chorus rounds out the vocal
cast. The orchestra did its part skill
fully, and special mention should be
made of the three pianists, who had to
interpret much of the plot. The battle
of the pianos in the first act is one of
the highlights.
Jerome Kern turned out the best
musical score of his career, even ex
ceeding "Show Boat." Such pieces as
"The Night Was Made for Love," "She
Didn't Say 'Yes,'" "One Moment
Alone," "The Breeze Kissed Your
Hair," and "Poor Pierrot" made big
hits with the audience, which was, in
cidentally, very appreciative and gen
erous in its applause.

Very honorable mention should also
be given to the stage crew. There are
fourteen scenes with sixteen settings,
but the sets are shifted with such speed
that not a moment's delay is had. It is
a great relief not to have to wait and
wait between scenes.

The dialogue is, at the risk of using
too many superlatives, far above the
average. Inez Courtney, Olaf Hytten,
Edgar Norton, and Liana Galen provide
comic interludes that set ofT gales of
laughter, and the repartee between
Miss Gahagan and Armand Kaliz at
tains classic heights.
The acting of Miss Gahagan, Greg
ory, and Mine. Baclanova is good. Sev
eral times a tragic scene is changed to
a light one by a simple gesture on the
part of one of these players. Others in
the cast, notably Marvin Jensen, Josica
Mario, and Sergei. Arno, supply bits
which touch up the plot.
Some good dancing is thrown in, too.
Jensen and Miss Courtney make a fast
team, and one episode, representing
the hallucinations of the composer
hero, features a strange dance done in
costumes of aluminum paint of brilliant
colors against a black background. It's
a weird masterpiece.
The plot. A Rumanian composer and
an American girl fall in love in Brus

sels, one of the most cosmopolitan cities
in the world. Misunderstandings and
jealousies separate them, and the
struggle over the composer's opera—
"The Passionate Pilgrim"—leads to
further complications. Finally, how
ever, and of course, the play is a suc
cess, explanations are in order, and
happiness reigns supreme. It sounds
like an old story, but it is worked out
effectively and entertainingly. —N.V.S,
JEWEL ROBBERY — At Blanco's
Mountain View Theatre.
If you failed to see this picture when
it was shown recently at the New
Stanford, it will pay you to run down
to Mountain View and take it in. An
unusual plot, fast and snappy dialogue,
excellent acting by Kay Francis and
William Powell, and plenty of humor
and excitement will provide you with
an evening's good entertainment.
The title is rather deceiving, if you
expect a gangster story. There is a
jewel robbery—in fact, several of them
—with Powell as the suave burglar
who works so efficiently that your
sympathies are all with him. Kay
Francis, as the bored baroness, wears
gorgeous clothes and a radiant smile,
and is the perfect complement for the
clever thief. It's all really very good.

Alone," "The Breeze Kissed Your
Hair," and "Poor Pierrot" made big
hits with the audience, which was, in
cidentally, very appreciative and gen
erous in its applause.

Very honorable mention should also
be given to the stage crew. There are
fourteen scenes with sixteen settings,
but the sets are shifted with such speed
that not a moment's delay is had. It is
a great relief not to have to wait and
wait between scenes.

The dialogue is, at the risk of using
too many superlatives, far above the
average. Inez Courtney, Olaf Hytten,
Edgar Norton, and Liana Galen provide
comic interludes that set ofT gales of
laughter, and the repartee between
Miss Gahagan and Armand Kaliz at
tains classic heights.
The acting of Miss Gahagan, Greg
ory, and Mine. Baclanova is good. Sev
eral times a tragic scene is changed to
a light one by a simple gesture on the
part of one of these players. Others in
the cast, notably Marvin Jensen, Josica
Mario, and Sergei. Arno, supply bits
which touch up the plot.
Some good dancing is thrown in, too.
Jensen and Miss Courtney make a fast
team, and one episode, representing
the hallucinations of the composer
hero, features a strange dance done in
costumes of aluminum paint of brilliant
colors against a black background. It's
a weird masterpiece.
The plot. A Rumanian composer and
an American girl fall in love in Brus

sels, one of the most cosmopolitan cities
in the world. Misunderstandings and
jealousies separate them, and the
struggle over the composer's opera—
"The Passionate Pilgrim"—leads to
further complications. Finally, how
ever, and of course, the play is a suc
cess, explanations are in order, and
happiness reigns supreme. It sounds
like an old story, but it is worked out
effectively and entertainingly. —N.V.S,
JEWEL ROBBERY — At Blanco's
Mountain View Theatre.
If you failed to see this picture when
it was shown recently at the New
Stanford, it will pay you to run down
to Mountain View and take it in. An
unusual plot, fast and snappy dialogue,
excellent acting by Kay Francis and
William Powell, and plenty of humor
and excitement will provide you with
an evening's good entertainment.
The title is rather deceiving, if you
expect a gangster story. There is a
jewel robbery—in fact, several of them
—with Powell as the suave burglar
who works so efficiently that your
sympathies are all with him. Kay
Francis, as the bored baroness, wears
gorgeous clothes and a radiant smile,
and is the perfect complement for the
clever thief. It's all really very good.

THE CAT AND TIIE FIDDLE—At the
Outran Theatre, San Francisco.
Various people look for various
things in a musical play. Some want
superb singing; some, good acting;
a perfect plot; some, excellent
directing; some, sparkling dialogue. And
then there are some who want all of
these wrapped up in one performance.
They can get it in this operetta, "The
Cat and the Fiddle."
The music is splendid. Helen Gaha
gan, Paul Gregory, Olga Baclanova, and
Sam Ash have singing leads which of
fer them excellent vehicles for their
rich voices, and a well-balanced andi
powerful chorus rounds out the vocal
cast. The orchestra did its part skill
fully, and special mention should be
made of the three pianists, who had to
interpret much of the plot. The battle
of the pianos in the first act is one of
the highlights.
Jerome Kern turned out the best
musical score of his career, even ex
ceeding "Show Boat." Such pieces as
"The Night Was Made for Love," "She
Didn't Say 'Yes,'" "One Moment
Alone," "The Breeze Kissed Your
Hair," and "Poor Pierrot" made big
hits with the audience, which was, in
cidentally, very appreciative and gen
