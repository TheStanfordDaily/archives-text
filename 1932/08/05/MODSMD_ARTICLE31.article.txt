# THE
						DIARY OF AN EX-PRESIDENT BY JOHN P. WINTERGREEN.
## 
### 
Mr. Ryskind, who is co-author with
George Kaufman of the Pulitzer Prize
musical comedy, "Of Thee I Sing," is
the editor of this famous diary by
"President Wintergreen." Six months'
digging in the new subway on Eighth
Avenue rewarded Morrie Ryskind,
when he finally unearthed this diary of
the "former president." It covers
roughly the first four months of his
administration and unfolds a wealth
of incidents hitherto not touched upon.
In presenting this diary Mr. Ryskind
said that ho felt he was helping to tear
aside the veil that has separated us
from the past. If you liked "Of Thee I
Sing" you cannot afford to miss this.
