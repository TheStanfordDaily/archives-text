# CAMPUS OPINION
## PROTESTS BAN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The announced policy of the Uni
versity is to allow on the campus no
discussion of controversial subjects ex
cept in strictly private meetings, or in
meetings in which all'possible points
of view are presented at once.*
Such an attitude on the part of the
University seems to many students
very unfortunate. As a nation we face
a most severe crisis involving problems
to whose solution all possible of the
disinterested intelligence of the coun
try must be directed. A strong condi
tioning factor in bringing about this
situation, as pointed out by the Presi
dent of our own University, is the
failure of the best elements of our citi
zenry to interest themselves in poli
tics.
It is in the academic atmosphere of
the University that we can hope for a
reasonably rational consideration of
the great economic and political prob
lems that confront us.
The Stanford Thomas-for-President
Club is attempting to stimulate an in
terest in politics and to encourage the
study of our economic problems. The
Club desires the opportunity of pre
senting the people of the vicinity the
views of the Socialist Party and its
candidates in regard to social problems.
We would hope by this method to in
crease interest in politics. Our request
has been refused on the grounds of
th*; University policy above stated. I
wish to protest against that policy, and
to suggest that the only practical step
toward the elimination of that policy
would be a general student protest.
