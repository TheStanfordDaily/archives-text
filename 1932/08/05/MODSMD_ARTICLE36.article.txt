# RESENTS REVIEW
## 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
Interesting to me was the review of
"The Washington Masquerade" appear
ing in Tuesday's Daily. The reviewer
stated that . three things were
neglected by the producers, a good
story, competent direction, and a sup
porting cast." These words are mighty
j powerful, and happen to disagree a bit
| with Benchley, Nathan, and other
j critics who are also bold enough to
[ print their reactions.
I felt that the parts of Senator
j Keane, his daughter, his wife, the power
j lobbyist, and the senators were cast
I carefully and successfully. Henry Bern
stein's "The Claw" enjoyed a successful
j Broadway run and the scenario was
faithful to the play.
