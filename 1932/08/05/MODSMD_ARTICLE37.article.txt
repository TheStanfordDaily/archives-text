# MENLO DOG TRACK PERMIT REFUSED AS ROTH LEADS FIGHT
## Gambling Seen As Menace As University, Council Hit Race Interests 
### 
Following a strenuous session in
which Almon E. Roth, University ;
comptroller, and Victor DuPont, one ;
of the dog-racing sponsors, waged a i
war of words, the Menlo Cily Council
Tuesday night refused to grant a per- â– 
mit for a racing track.
Roth, who spoke at the meeting "not
only us a representative of Stanford, !
but ;is a business man," was backed by
more than 100 merchants and citizens j
of Menlo Park.
Issue Has Precedent
The comptroller challenged the city
council by saying, "We cannot tolerate |
gambling, and we will go before the |
legislature to oppose this thing if neces- !
sary. We had a law passed against-the i
selling of liquor within a mile and ii j
half of colleges and we can do the i
same thing for dog racing."
He stated that cases of trouble with
students have already arisen from the i
Belmont track, and that the close [
proximity of one at Menlo Park would ;
be an even worse influence.
University Opposed
DuPont argued that the city council j
should not heed protests from an out- j
side community or county. He pointed
out the benefits to the Menlo unem- j
ployed. One of this group, George j
Baron, asserted that Stanford has, in >
the football stadium, "one of the big- j
gest gambling places on the coast," and j
so should not protest against a dog ,
racing track because of the options.
After hearing further from several!
other residents of Menlo Park, the city |
council voted unanimously to deny the j
petition.
