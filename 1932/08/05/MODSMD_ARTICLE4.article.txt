# JUMPING JUDA ON JOLLY JAVA JAG, JOUNCES JITTERS
## 
### 
Some people don't like spinach.
Others have an aversion for arti
chokes. But Hal Juda, who plays
water polo for Coach Norton
Thornton, has suddenly developed
an intense hatred for coffee. In
fact, coffee to him is a "fightin'
word."
It seems that Juda had several
term papers due and a mid
quarter on Monday. That meant
studying and typing all Sunday
night, so Juda rolled up his
sleeves, adjusted his reading
lamp, and went to work.
Then he began to get sleepy.
Coffee, he reasoned, would keep
him awake, but he decided he'd
need a gallon of it to see him
through the night. Coffee contains
caffeine, and caffeine keeps you
awake So Juda bought a
bottle of caffeine pills.
He swallowed one. It took no
effect, so he tried another, and
still he was sleepy. Then he took
three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . .
But he took an overdose, it seems,
for he couldn't sleep Monday
night, or Tuesday night. "But I
finished the term papers," he
maintains.
