# CHICAGO CITIZENS MUST VISIT SPEAKEASIES TO SEE GANGSTERS
## 
### 
"Chicago does come in for her share
of gangsters, but the average citizen
does not come in contact with them,
affirmed E. W. Hinton of the Univer
sity of Chicago, who arrived at Stan- '
ford last Monday to act as guest pro
fessor in code pleading. "Gangsters j
confine themselves to the liquor trade j
and do not interfere in the affairs of .
normal people," he said.
Dr. Hinton discussed law enforce
ment in Chicago and the city's eco- j
nomic situation. In the course of the
interview he remarked that the Stan
ford School of Law and that of the
University of Chicago are run on prac
tically the same system.
Unable to Borrow
In reply to a question regarding
Chicago's economic situation it was
explained that Chicago is, at present,
bonded to the limit and unable to bor
row any more money. "Some changes

] have been made in the tax assessment
! system, and the present mayor, Anton |
J. Cennack, is doing all that is pos
: sible to remedy the damage done by j
• (he extravagance of former administra- !
tions," declared Dr. Hinton. "Thirty
' million dollars have been cut from the j
city budget, but the great steel mills 1
• and packing companies are running at
j a 20 per cent capacity."
Hints Law Changes
Commenting on law-enforcement in j
the city of Chicago, Dr. Hinton re- |
I marked that laws are in a constant I
j process of evolution. "Though Chicago's |
; laws have not yet been affected by J
< the present economic crisis, it is un
-1 doubtedly true that the situation will I
cause more or less damage," he said, * j
"Reconstruction will begin in the j
I large centers of industry, and Chicago ,
i will come through, if the rest of the 1
I country does, in the present crisis." j
