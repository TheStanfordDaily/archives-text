Two great races, the 200-meter dash
finals and the 110-meter hurdles, saw

and tying the world's record in the
hurdle race. Eddie Tolan took the lead

'to beat Jonath of Germany for third
position. Simpson took a close second
! to Tolan, whose time was 21.2 seconds.

hurdles all the way, but in his haste to
break the world's record he misjudged

tion of Welscher, who knocked over
four hurdles, gave him a third. Saling
