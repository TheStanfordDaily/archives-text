# EXPERIMENTS HERE MAY AFFORD FRESH FRUIT IN JANUARY
## Government Workers Trying Dry Ice As Long-lime Preservative 
### 
Fruit frozen in an alcohol bath, which
will give the public berries in January,
is the object of an experiment being
carried on by D. G. Sorber and C. G.
Church of the laboratory of fruit and
vegetable chemistry in the U.S. De
partment of Agriculture. The men are
working in a laboratory on the Stan
ford campus, through the co-operation
of W. F. Wight, lecturer in botany at
Stanford.
The essential differences between the
"frozen fruit" method of canning, and
the process now in use are the seeding
of the berries by means of a "sepro
sieve," and a final freezing of the fruit
instead of cooking.
Fruit Weighed First
Some of the fruit has been frozen
for a year and still retains the natural
flavor and color. It is believed that
fruit can be kept indefinitely by this
process without any deterioration or
fermentation.
In the experimental process the fruit
is first weighed to determine the
amount of pulp, pits, and skin. The
commercial process will start with the
washing and pitting of the fruit. The
fruit is then passed through the "sepro
sieve" which squeezes it between
sieves with different sized holes. This
separates the seeds from the pulp, even
in such berries as youngberries, straw
berries, and raspberries.
Given Alcohol Bath
The pulp and juice are mixed in dif
ferent quantities with sugar syrup and
sealed by vacuum. The cans are then
placed in an alcohol bath at -40 de
grees or colder. The material is then
kept by means of carbon dioxide, or
"dry ice," at a temperature of about
-110.
The purpose of the experiment is to
perfect the utilization of fresh fruit,
and to help the fruit grower. The nine
different fruits which have been han
dled can be used as ice cream bases,
shortcakes, fresh fruit and cream.
