### 
Dr. Aurelia Reinhardt, president of
Mills College, told reporters in Edin
burgh Tuesday that the sessions of the
world conference of university women
were "a balaclava of talk."

Dr. Reinhardt said that "there was
talking to the right of them and talk
ing to the left of them," but that the
main subject of the discussions —
whether higher education fits women
for contemporary life—was only rarely
touched.
