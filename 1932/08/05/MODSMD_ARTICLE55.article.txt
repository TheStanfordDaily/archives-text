# Gledhill Eliminated In Meadow Club Tourney
## 
### 
Keith Gledhill, Stanford tennis cap
tain and No. 8 national ranking player,
was eliminated in the quarter-finals
of the Meadow Club's forty-second an
nual invitation tournament Tuesday by
Gregory Mangin, 1-6, 6-1, 9-7.
Gledhill played in top form during
the first set, but coasted during the
second, and was unable to hit his stride
again in the deciding third. Mangin's
steadiness offset the Card star's occa
sional flashes of brilliance.
