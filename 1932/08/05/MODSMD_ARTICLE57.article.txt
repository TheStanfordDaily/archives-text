# KREPS FORESEES UPWARD SWING IN CURRENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
## 
### 
Recent business and governmental
developments indicate a definite up
ward trend in the current business
cycle, in the opinion of T. J. Krops, as
sociate professor of statistics in the
Graduate School of Business.
Kreps states that to date our attitude
toward the foreign debt and the tariff
has Ijsen self-contradictory. He de
clared that a creditor nation should
realize free trade is essential if the
debtors are to achieve an economic
position which will enable them to pay.
Because of this he thinks Senator
Borah's shift from his former policy of
isolation indicates a common-sense at
titude in government much more likely
to meet the situation.
Lauds Reconstruction Move
The Stanford statistician believes
that the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration's move is a most sensible
legislation, and one which will be
prominent in bringing back good times.
He believes, in this matter, in a central
pool which will furnish money and
back up building in times of depi'es
sion. Such a pool would avoid the
present difficulty of the Building and
Loan associations.
Pointing to the already consumated
adjustments in the raw material indus
tries—cattle, sugar, hogs, cotton —he
states that he expects similar adjust
ments in ajl industries. He noted in this
connection a balancing in wages and
prices which is giving the working man

| more for his money.
Other factors which are typical of
j recovery are the increased savings de
| posits, now at their highest peak, and
the steady rise in»the price of bonds.
Frontier Spirit Outmoded
"Our frontier spirit of self-reliance
; which persists in our small self-sus
; tained banks is outmoded," said Kreps
| in speaking of our bank failures. Both
| Canada and the United States under
i went virtually the same conditions in
jthe last three years, but Canada's
branch-bank system did not fail as did
j our regional banks. Recent bills intro
j duced in Congress indicate a tendency
j to reorganize the banks on a system
! similar to that in Canada and Eng
! land.
International financial leadership is
likely to go back to London, as the
result of New York's inability to han
dle the situation in Krep's opinion. He
gives as his reason for this, the Ameri
. can banker's debtor psychology—re
| striction on lending and seeking for a
liquid position. London has known that
I "the essence of good banking lies in
lending in periods of stress," Kreps ex
! plained.

International financial leadership is

result of New York's inability to han

gives as his reason for this, the Ameri

liquid position. London has known that

lending in periods of stress," Kreps ex

Recent business and governmental
developments indicate a definite up
ward trend in the current business
cycle, in the opinion of T. J. Krops, as
sociate professor of statistics in the
Graduate School of Business.
Kreps states that to date our attitude
toward the foreign debt and the tariff
has Ijsen self-contradictory. He de
clared that a creditor nation should
realize free trade is essential if the
debtors are to achieve an economic
position which will enable them to pay.
Because of this he thinks Senator
Borah's shift from his former policy of
isolation indicates a common-sense at
titude in government much more likely
to meet the situation.
Lauds Reconstruction Move
The Stanford statistician believes
that the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration's move is a most sensible
legislation, and one which will be
prominent in bringing back good times.
He believes, in this matter, in a central
pool which will furnish money and
back up building in times of depi'es
sion. Such a pool would avoid the
present difficulty of the Building and
Loan associations.
Pointing to the already consumated
adjustments in the raw material indus
tries—cattle, sugar, hogs, cotton —he
states that he expects similar adjust
ments in ajl industries. He noted in this
connection a balancing in wages and
prices which is giving the working man

| more for his money.
Other factors which are typical of
j recovery are the increased savings de
| posits, now at their highest peak, and
the steady rise in»the price of bonds.
Frontier Spirit Outmoded
"Our frontier spirit of self-reliance
; which persists in our small self-sus
; tained banks is outmoded," said Kreps
| in speaking of our bank failures. Both
| Canada and the United States under
i went virtually the same conditions in
jthe last three years, but Canada's
branch-bank system did not fail as did
j our regional banks. Recent bills intro
j duced in Congress indicate a tendency
j to reorganize the banks on a system
! similar to that in Canada and Eng
! land.
