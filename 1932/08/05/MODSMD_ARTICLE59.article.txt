# NO REAL MENACE IN UNEMPLOYMENT HERE SAYS MILLER
## English Economist Reveals Britain Faced Problem For 60 Years 
### 
That America will probably never be
faced with the acute unemployment
situation to which England, a small in
dustrial nation, is subject, is the opin
ion of Dr. Margaret Miller, who spoke
in the Little Theatre yesterday on
some aspects of post-war unemploy
ment in England. Dr. Miller lectured
Tuesday evening on Russia's Five-
Year Plan.
Unemployment has been a problem
in England for 60 years or more, the
speaker declared. However, it was rela
tively unimportant before the World
War.
Trade Is Basis
The fundamental disclocation of trade
was declared to be the basis for this
condition, but disorganization during
the war, and over-production follow
ing the war, as well as crowded read
justment'to modern methods after a
static period are also responsible.
Another difficulty in England, ac
cording to Dr. Miller, is the lack of
flexibility. There is a prejudice on the
part of trade union leaders who think
machinery is an enemy of employment,
and a feeling against employing uni
versity graduates, who as a I'esult sel
dom go into business.
Outlines Measures
After giving the general reasons for
the post-war conditions in England,
Dr. Miller outlined the administrative
and financial measures that have been
passed to relieve the situation.
One of the administrative measures
for relief which she outlined was the
establishment of Training Stations in
1925 to teach new occupations to men
and women who had permanently lost
their former positions.
In conclusion Dr. Miller made clear
that the situation is primarily a human
problem, and that the most far-reach
ing result of long unemployment is the
mental, moral, and physical deteriora
tion of the workers. To aid this condi
tion, many private organizations in the
industrial cities have started occupa
tional and recreational centers.
