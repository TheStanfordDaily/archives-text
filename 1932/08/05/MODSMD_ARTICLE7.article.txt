# FLORENCE M. CRAIG RETURNS TO LIBRARY FROM MICHIGAN U.
## 
### 
The last few years have witnessed a
general trend of exchange professors
and students between various American
universities and those in Europe.
In tune with this growing experi
ment is the library exchange that took
place last year between Miss Florence
M. Craig, reviser in the catalogue de
partment of the Stanford Library, and
Miss Marjorie Kunze of the university
library at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
"This exchange is perhaps more dif
ficult in adjustment than that of inde
pendent faculty members," said Miss
Craig, who returned to the in
June, after spending seven months in
the University of Michigan library.
"'But its advantages, nevertheless, are
numerous. A member of a library staff
must readjust to the routine of a new
place, and it may take some time to
do so. However, the exchange of ideas
and the methods of doing things, seems
to me to merit the inconvenience. Ex
change of staff members aids inter
library co-operation; and the new
methods learned, as well as the per
sonal contacts made, cannot help but
prove of use in the long run."
