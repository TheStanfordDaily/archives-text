# STOCK DIRECTS FINAL CONCERT AT WOODLAND
## Chicago Musician Scores Hit With Interpretation Of Tschaikowsky Auditors Enthusiastic Over Selections By Wagner, Johannes Brahms 
### Charles Beardsley 
Frederick Stock, directing Ihe final
concert of the season in the Woodland
Theatre at Hillsborough Sunday after
noon, was distinctly an interpreter of
music as he felt it throughout the long
and varied program.
In the opening number an "Academic
Festival" overture by Johannes
Brahms, Stock caught the humor of the
work and made it a thoroughly inter
esting sketch. Beginning with a fresh
man song, the substance of several
German student-songs i.rc woven into
the main theme, lastly presenting the
well-known "Gaudeamus Igitur" by
the entire wind section against a pas
sage of scales by the strings.
Tschaikowsky IMaycd
But it was not until Stock advanced
well into Tschaikowsky's "Symphony
No. 4, F Minor" that he revealed him
self fully. This tremendous work, writ
ten by the composer lor his patron
Mine, von Meek, was an inspiring treat
ment under the baton of the Chicago
conductor. The introductory first
movement presents the entire sym
phony in germ, and the theme is
heightened throughout the intitial an
dante. The andantino comes as a melo
dious relief, lighter and less intense in
mood than the first movement. In the
scherzo Stock stopped directing the
orchestra, and the musicians continued
through the movement without a ges
ture from their conductor.
In the finale, the glowing music of
Tschaikowsky is at its most mature
peak of expression. There is a joy which
touches upon renunciation. The theme
is almost that of sacrifice) yet definitely
with the philosophy that happiness
may be found in the joy of others.
Concludes With Wagner
Wagner's prelude to his "Die Meis
tersinger" opened the last half of the
concert with a sumptuous introduction.
The main themes of the opera were
displayed, including the prize song and
mastersinger motive, which came in
the basses and tuba, while the wood
winds, first violins, and "cellos com
bined with the rest of the orchestra
to supply clever and elaborate touches
before the climax. Played in direct
contrast to the more romantic Tschai
kowsky symphony, its full appeal was
pronounced.
The last two groups were light and
charming, with enough substance and
color to have already made them fa
vorites with symphony audiences. Sun
day afternoon they were well received,
particularly Moussorgsky's "Ballet of
Chickens in Their Shells."
Audience Appreciative
Concluding with "Tales from the
Vienna Woods," the program was de
lightful. Stock drew all the charm and
maturity from the Strauss composi
tion with which the author endowed it,
one was made to feel. And his inter
pretation was not lacking depth anu
tonal perfection, although it was a dif
ferent treatment from the average
slower rendition.
A well-chosen and thoroughly varied
choice of selections, this final concert
of the Woodland series was possibly
the warmest received of the four. An
enthusiastic audience proved its fond
ness for Tschaikowsky and Strauss in
an equally demonstrative manner.

day afternoon they were well received,
particularly Moussorgsky's "Ballet of
Chickens in Their Shells."
Audience Appreciative
Concluding with "Tales from the
Vienna Woods," the program was de
lightful. Stock drew all the charm and
maturity from the Strauss composi
tion with which the author endowed it,
one was made to feel. And his inter
pretation was not lacking depth anu
tonal perfection, although it was a dif
ferent treatment from the average
slower rendition.
A well-chosen and thoroughly varied
choice of selections, this final concert
of the Woodland series was possibly
the warmest received of the four. An
enthusiastic audience proved its fond
ness for Tschaikowsky and Strauss in
an equally demonstrative manner.
Frederick Stock, directing Ihe final
concert of the season in the Woodland
Theatre at Hillsborough Sunday after
noon, was distinctly an interpreter of
music as he felt it throughout the long
and varied program.
In the opening number an "Academic
Festival" overture by Johannes
Brahms, Stock caught the humor of the
work and made it a thoroughly inter
esting sketch. Beginning with a fresh
man song, the substance of several
German student-songs i.rc woven into
the main theme, lastly presenting the
well-known "Gaudeamus Igitur" by
the entire wind section against a pas
sage of scales by the strings.
Tschaikowsky IMaycd
But it was not until Stock advanced
well into Tschaikowsky's "Symphony
No. 4, F Minor" that he revealed him
self fully. This tremendous work, writ
ten by the composer lor his patron
Mine, von Meek, was an inspiring treat
ment under the baton of the Chicago
conductor. The introductory first
movement presents the entire sym
phony in germ, and the theme is
heightened throughout the intitial an
dante. The andantino comes as a melo
dious relief, lighter and less intense in
mood than the first movement. In the
scherzo Stock stopped directing the
orchestra, and the musicians continued
through the movement without a ges
ture from their conductor.
In the finale, the glowing music of
Tschaikowsky is at its most mature
peak of expression. There is a joy which
touches upon renunciation. The theme
is almost that of sacrifice) yet definitely
with the philosophy that happiness
may be found in the joy of others.
Concludes With Wagner
Wagner's prelude to his "Die Meis
tersinger" opened the last half of the
concert with a sumptuous introduction.
The main themes of the opera were
displayed, including the prize song and
mastersinger motive, which came in
the basses and tuba, while the wood
winds, first violins, and "cellos com
bined with the rest of the orchestra
to supply clever and elaborate touches
before the climax. Played in direct
contrast to the more romantic Tschai
kowsky symphony, its full appeal was
pronounced.
The last two groups were light and
charming, with enough substance and
color to have already made them fa
vorites with symphony audiences. Sun
day afternoon they were well received,
particularly Moussorgsky's "Ballet of
Chickens in Their Shells."
