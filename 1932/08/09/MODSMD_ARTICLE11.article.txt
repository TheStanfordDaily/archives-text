# CHILD PSYCHOLOGY TO BE SUBJECT OF DR. LEWIN LECTURE
## 
### 
"Conflict Situations in Childhood,"
with film illustrations, is the-topic of a
lecture to be given by Professor Kurt
Lewin at 4:15 o'clock Wednesday after
noon in the Little Theatre. Dr. Lewin,
acting professor of psychology from the
University of Berlin, will speak in
English. The public is invited.
The lecture will be mainly concerned
with the different kinds of conflict
situations. The film shows conflict in
choosing the abilities suddenly brought
out through the difficulties of a new
situation, and the conflicting social
situation in the resulting embarrass
ment and struggle. The development of
conflict will be discussed and its mean
ing in relation to the will.
Lewin received his Ph.D. from the
University of Berlin in 1914, and has
been a professor there since 1927. He
is also a member of the Berlin Psycho
logical Institute.
Since 1917 he has written several
articles in psychological periodicals,
and is the author of a number of mono
graphs. During the last year he has
written "Environmental forcc-s in men
tal development and child behavior"
and "Conflict between Aristotilian and
Galilean Modes of Thought in Psych
ology," and the "Psychology of Punish
ment."
"Dr. Lewin is perhaps best known
for his researches in the field of will
and emotion and for a very original
series of studies in child psychology.
He is unquestionably one of the most
outstanding psychologists in Germany
today," is the opinion of L. M. Terman,
professor .of psychology at Stanford.
