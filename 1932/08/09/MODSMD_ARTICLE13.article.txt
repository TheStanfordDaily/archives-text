# Heads Up! Star Shower Due "Star Dust" Theme As Earth Passes Meteors Milky Way On Spree Friday
## 
### 
Stanford is to be treated to a pyro
technical display early Friday morn
ing, August 12, that should beat all
' Fourth of July and Chinese New Year
! demonstrations ever given. Once every
year the earth passes through a cluster
of meteors that afford, as they strike
the atmosphere, a highly spectacular
show for the inhabitants of this planet,
j These meteors, or meteorites, are
made incandescent by friction crfused
by their terrific speed through the .air
as they hurl themselves earthward. It
is by this incandescence that the earth
! lings are made aware of the unusual
i happenings occurring in their atmos-
I phere.
According to Dr. Sidney D. Townley,
I professor of astronomy and geodesy,
I about one out of a million of these
' meteorites ever reach the earth's sur-
I face.
A "bolt from the blue" is pleasant
to think about, but would be very un
! pleasant to come into contact with.
Especially so as the meteorites that
pass safely through the air are heated
white-hot.
Students on the campus will be able
to go hack to their childhood days, and
| recite "Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

How I wonder what you are?" with
equanimity on the night of the "star
shower." This little ditty will be quite
appropriate at that time.
And too, those amongst us who have
poetic instincts can stroll unconcerned
ly about the fields on the campus, gaz
ing rapturously at the blazing "stars"
as they trace their write way across
the heavens. "Star-dust" can be hum- ;
med with no fear of being out of place, j
for it is certain that some of this j
elusive stuff will be wafted down from !
above.
Stanfordites who delight in counting
stars as they sit out under the open j
sky are warned to stay indoors on Fri- j
day morning, for, according to Profcs- |
sor Townley, the amount of stars vis- I
ible on a night like this one are greater
than on other nights. Unless one is of I
a mathematical turn of mind, the task '
of counting the stars . visible, falling j
and otherwise, would be insurmount- |
able.
Quite in keeping with the unusual
heavenly occurrences this month is the ;
eclipse of the sun due August 31. There !
will be a partial darkening of "Old Sol" [
at Stanford on that day. However, the j
real path of the "shadow" will pass J
over the eastern United States.
