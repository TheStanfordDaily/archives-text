# Education Meet Declared To Be Best Of Confabs
## May Hold Similar Session Here Next Summer 
### 
More than 400 educators from north
ern California and the Bay section at
tended the two-day conference of the
Society of Secondary Education held
here Thursday and Friday.
The general problems of reconstruct
ing the curriculum of secondary schools
to meet the needs of the times were
discussed at the morning sessions of
the conference. Round table discussions
were held each afternoon by the teach
ers to determine needed changes.
The three aspects of reconstruction
considered at the conference were
knowledge of the boys and girls and
the positions they will fill in society;
development of a course of study de
signed to meet the needs of present
day youth; and a system of counseling.
Fads Held Important
The conference speakers agreed that
there must be a purpose or reason for
everything taught and this must tie up
with first function of education: the
development of good citizens. It was
said that some of the so-called fads
and frills of education are really the
important units because they make for
character training and good citizen
ship. Following the same line of
thought the speakers suggested that
some of the time-honored fundamen
tals might be classed as fads and frills
because they contribute little or noth
ing to bringing about better citizen
ship.
A good citizen was described as one
who has desirable attitudes and skill
and an understanding of the social unit
in which he lives.
Having developed certain broad
principles on which the ideal curricu
lum should be built, the educators
spend the rest of the conference period
in discussing problems of instruction,
paying particular attention to the unit
rather than the day-to-day instruction.
Many of the speeches given during
the conference will appear in the fall
issue of the California Quarterly, of
ficial publication of the Society of
Secondary Education.
Conference Praised
Don Nugent, president of Phi Delta
Kappa, speaking at the Education ban
quet Thursday night, said that the local
conference was the outstanding one of
the five held at different universities
this summer by the society.
In speaking of the conference, A. C.
Argo, general chairman, expressed his
appreciation of Dr. Ellwood Cubberley,
dean of the School of Education, of the
i other members of the education fac
j idty, and of Stanford in making the
two-day meeting a success.
It is probable that a similar meeting
will be held here next summer, ac
j cording to Argo.
