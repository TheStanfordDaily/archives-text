# A 						PRICE IN KEEPING
## 
### 
Continuing a series of depression dances which originated
last spring quarter, the Toyoll Summer Club has announced a
hard times dance for its next entertainment, open to the general
student-body. The group deserves commendation for providing
this form of recreation which they describe as one "both finan
cially appealing and at the same time up to the standard of
previous functions."
However, as to whether the sum of 75 cents may be con
sidered an appealing price is a moot question. The pioneer
depression dance on the campus featured a ten-cent admission
charge which totaled more than enough to recompense the or
chestra. Any embellishments necessitating expenditures other
than an orchestra, lights, and use of the dance floor are super
fluous and unnecessary for a depression dance.
A compromise of fifty cents, or better yet, twenty-five cents,
admission charge would attract a larger crowd. The reduction
is recommended as a plausible means of insuring a greater so
cial as well as financial success.
