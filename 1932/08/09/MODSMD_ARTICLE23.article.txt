# "AYE GO HUM"
## 
### 
When the glamorous (iarbo packed licr berets and Basque
sweaters last week and sailed tor Sweden, she look with her
7a(),000 American dollars, leaving behind a promise that she
will return if Hollywood pays $0()(),()()() "ransom."
Let us hope that her employers will shake their heads with
one big collective negative and firmly answer "no!" to this
ransom demand.
Then let them search out a voluptuous American girl, exile
her to a luxurious fjungalow in Beverley Hills, and develop her
as (iarbo's successor. Let the publicity men coin for her a sure
lire title to replace the Baltic Blonde .... say the Boston Blonde,
the Buffalo Blonde, or the Baltimore Blonde.
Then cast her as a ladv with a past, place her before a
camera, and tell her to emote passion. As personified bv (iarbo,
it is very simple. Merely breathe deeply once or twice, lift the
eyebrows, gaze dreamily at the leading man, and say occasion
ally, in a low monotone, "You better go now."
Afterward, let the publicity department concentrate on her,
and lill the fan magazines and daily movie columns with saccha
rine drivel on how she loathes company, spends hours hiking
in the hills alone, and longs to go back to Baltimore, or Boston,
or Buffalo, and be undisturbed. The result will be a worthy
substitute for (iarbo .... an American substitute who will not
take American dollars to a foreign country.
The original (iarbo, that Swede and lovely gal, .has always
disliked her job. And with a successor established, she can stay
in her beloved fatherland, there to manufacture safety matches,
or lisli for sardines in the icy fjords, or just stare in peaceful
meditation at the Northern Lights.
