REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM
—At the Stanford Theatre.
Just'when everyone, including econ
omists, had finished convincing them
selves that the farm was "no more"
and Chic Sale was America's real his
torian, along comes "Rebecca of Sunny
brook Farm" to spoil the theory.
Marian Nixon as Rebecca and Ralph
Bellamy as Dr. Adam Ladd, the pipe
smoking country doctor who finally
ends the show by "up and marrying
the girl," are likeable incongruities.
Rebecca comes to Riverboro to live
with her great aunts Miranda (Louise
Hale) and Jane (Mae Marsh). Aunt
Miranda polishes hardwood floors—
they are not to be walked on. Rebecca
walks on hardwood floors—they should
never be polished. And so it goes, with
Rebecca continually doing the right
things in the wrong way.
Drama is furnished when Dr. Ladd
and Rebecca make a midnight trip to
a patient's home in a New England
blizzard filmed at Long Beach.
Allan Hale as Mr. Simpson almost
steals the show as the "eccentric" hus
band who just won't buy his "wife" a
wedding ring and gives away his baby
as though it were a pair of peg-top
trousers. —F.J.M.
THE OMNIBUS OF SPORT—Edited
by Grantland Rice and Harford
Powell. Harper & Brothers. 1032.
$3.50.
Those of you who have been listen
ing to Grantland Rice's nightly broad
cast of the Olympic Games need not
be discouraged because he is one of
the editors of this book. He writes
much better than he talks.
This book is an anthology of every
kind of sport from fishing to Olympics,
even including dog-fighting and card
games. News articles, ancient Greek
essays, modern poems and stories, and
histories of each sport are included.
Such writers as Irvin Cobb, Ring
Lardner, Ernest Hemingway, A. Conan
Doyle, and Donn Byrne are all repre
sented. Every sports lover should read
it. —N.V.S.
PORTRAIT OF A PALADIN—By Vin
cente Huidobro. Translated from the
Spanish by Warre B. Weils. Iloracc
Liveright, Inc. 1932. $2.50. At the
Stanford Bookstore.
Once upon a time, when Douglas
Fairbanks the elder was in Madrid, he
heard so many tales of the great Cid
that he felt that a good movie might
be built around the mighty Spanish
character. Accordingly, he asked a
young Castillian, Vincente Huidobro,
to collect some data on this hero.
Apparently nothing ever came from
Fairbanks' interest, but Huidobro's re
search inspired him to such an extent
that he wrote this book, "Portrait of a
Paladin." He wrote it with such sin
cerity and pride (for he discovered
that he was a remote descendant of the
Cid), that it became a best-seller
throughout Europe, and critics hailed
it as a masterpiece.
Now Warre Wells has translated the
book into English, and it is a job for
which we may be thankful. One of the
best things which Wells did was to pre
serve the original form of all the
Spanish proper and place-names. Some
translators feel that they have to Ang
licize every woi-d, which robs a work
of much of its beauty and reality.
The title could be aptly called "Por
traits of a Paladin," for the book con
sists of 30 pictures of Rodrigo Diaz de

Vivar, the Cid Campeador. The great
Spanish medieval hero is effectively
portrayed in a series of episodes which
keep on the straight and narrow his
torical path, but at the same time
make use of many of the flowery
legends which have sprung up so
thickly along the way.
Huidobro handles the Cid with a
joyful and exuberant spirit. He has an
international linguistic sense, and
makes frequent use of Gallic and
American expressions, believing that
"languages should invade one another."
His picturesque style gives one the
impression that here is a poet writing,
in the form of a novel, a biography of
one of the most glamorous figures in
the epic of mankind. —N.V.S.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A FISHER
MAN. By Frank Parker Day. $2.
This book has been reissued in re
sponse to a general demand by the
devotees of the gentle art of angling.
This college president knows his
fish. But evidently the fish don't know
him. And if he can fish as well as he
can write about fishing (and he can),
he must be a second Isaac Walton. The
tang of out-of-doors, the sportsman's
spirit, and fisherman's luck permeate
every page. —B.K.
