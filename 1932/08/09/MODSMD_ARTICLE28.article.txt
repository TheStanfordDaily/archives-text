# MILLER, DYER WILL DON STARS, STRIPES FOR KEZAR EVENTS
## Track Stars To Compete For U.S. Against British Empire Squad 
### 
Bill Miller, Stanford's Olympic cham
pion pole vuulter, and Hec Dyer, for
mer Card sprint star, were among the
American track and field luminaries
announced yesterday by Head Coach
Lawson Robertson as entries in the
post-Olympic track meet between the
United States and the British Empire,
to be held in Kezar Stadium, San
Francisco, Sunday.
Other Pacific Coast stars who will
see action in this colorful anti-climax
to the greatest season in the history of
American sport include Bob Kiesel,
California sophomore sprint flash;
Frankie Wykoff, the "world's fastest
human" at S.C.; Ed Ablowich, this sea
on's Tfojan "firjd" in the quarter; Ralph
Hill, former Oregon distance runner;
Jefferson of U.C.L.A. in the pole vault;
Bob Van Osdel, Southern California
high-jumper; and Billie von Bremen,
star San Francisco woman athlete.

international athletes as have ever been
collected outside the Olympiads, them
selves. San Francisco Bay fans who

them when these track and field repre
sentatives of two great nations resume
rivalries in Kezar Stadium—perhaps
thrills as great or greater than were
served the Olympic Stadium throngs.

opening ceremonies of the Kezar con
tests, arrangements having been made

Francisco, Sunday.
Other Pacific Coast stars who will
see action in this colorful anti-climax
to the greatest season in the history of
American sport include Bob Kiesel,
California sophomore sprint flash;
Frankie Wykoff, the "world's fastest
human" at S.C.; Ed Ablowich, this sea
on's Tfojan "firjd" in the quarter; Ralph
Hill, former Oregon distance runner;
Jefferson of U.C.L.A. in the pole vault;
Bob Van Osdel, Southern California
high-jumper; and Billie von Bremen,
star San Francisco woman athlete.
Thrills-a-Plenty Promised
The U.S.A.-United Kingdom meet
will boast as imposing a collection of
international athletes as have ever been
collected outside the Olympiads, them
selves. San Francisco Bay fans who
were unable to witness the Games in
Los Angeles have thrills in store for
them when these track and field repre
sentatives of two great nations resume
rivalries in Kezar Stadium—perhaps
thrills as great or greater than were
served the Olympic Stadium throngs.
Military pageantry will mark the
opening ceremonies of the Kezar con
tests, arrangements having been made
for the participation of the infantry and
artillery units of the United States
army, naval reserve corps, national
guard, units from the Pacific battle
fleet, which will arrive in San Fran
cisco in time for the games, and vari
ous other military bodies.
