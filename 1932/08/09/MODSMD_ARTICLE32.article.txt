# "DINK" SAYS CARD BEST IN QUARTER
## But He Couldn't Beat Ben Eastman In 880 
### 
"Willie Carr is the world's best quar
ter. He can probably take Ben Eastman
in the hundred yard dash, but he could
nevei win from him in the half mile
run," said Dink Templeton upon his
arrival here from Los Angeles yester
day afternoon.
Dink was proud of his boys' show
ing in the Olympics but when asked
what he thought of next year's varsity,
he tersely said that four great athletes
couldn't make a track team and then,
too, next year is far away.
Clumsy Baton Passing
Although a clumsy method of baton
passing was used by the relay teams,
the American boys ran fast enough to
break existing records.
It was evident after Keisel ran the
first 100 meters in the 400 meter relay
that a new record would be made, and
Toppino, Dyer, and Wykoff came
through to cut eight-tenths seconds off
the existing time of 40.8 seconds.
Hill Scores Great Win
Dink smiled. "There is one unpopular
Finn down there," he said. "Lehtinen
was not only watching Hill's shadow
in front of him but deliberately turned
around and saw him before he turned
in front of him. But Hill scored one
of the greatest personal victories in
the 1932 Olympics." â€¢
Although Metcalfe ran an extra four
feet in the 200 meter dash, Tolan would
have won as his short legs and style of
running are better for a curved track.
But Simpson, Dink pointed out, who
had the extra four feet in his semi
final heat, probably hurt his chances
for winning as he strained himself to
qualify. This error and the extra lap
in the 3000 meter steeplechase were
unforgiveable mistakes.
