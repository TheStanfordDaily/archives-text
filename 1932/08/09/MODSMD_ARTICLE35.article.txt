# "UGLY," U.S. ARMY'S SURPRISE HORSE, TO PERFORM AT MENLO
## Ungainly Colt Developed Into Champion Jumper By Cavalry Private 
### 
"Ugly" is a horse.
"Ugly," says Webster, "means fright
ful, hideous, terrible, loathsome of
aspect and offensive to sight." And so
an awkward colt on his arrival at the
United States Army Training School
in Fort Worth was dubbed "Ugly."
An ungainly creature, lacking in
conformation, he typifies the definition
of the word. None of the officers would
willingly ride the outcast, who, they
thought, had merely been shipped to
fill in their quota of mounts to train
for manoeuvers.
Picked Up By Private
And then a private saw and liked
the ugly colt. Perhaps he felt some
thing in common with the outcast.
Permission was readily granted at his
request to work "Ugly" up .... no
one cared to bother about either of
them, and the private was an excellent
horseman.
But then came the surprise! "Ugly"
could jump; and soon the two outcasts
were taking hurdles that only two
other horses in the section could clear.
"Tanbark," one of the most famous of
world's jumpers, was one of these.
"Ugly" was no longer an outcast.
"Ugly" Now on Exhibition
At the present time "Ugly," who is
one of the best horses on the American
jumping team, is being exhibited in the
International Equestrian Jumping Con
test at the Olympics.
At the Horse Show, being sponsored
by the San Mateo County National
Horse Show Association at the Menlo
Circus Club from August 13 to 20,
"Ugly" and "Tanbark" will both jump
as entries of the American Jumping
Team. The Swedish Team will also ex
hibit at the show which will include
many of the finest horses in the
Middlewest and West.
Mrs. William P. Roth, president of
the association, will show "Chief of
Longview" and on Pa
rade," two world champions.
