# STANFORD MERMEN DEVELOP SPLASHING BRAND OF FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Stanford, traditional home of water
' polo, has found a new game. Invented
1 by Coach Norton Thornton it is called
' water football and combines the rough
I qualities of both games in a manner
! most difficult on the players.
Rules are practically the same as in
j football and a player is down only
! when he is downâ€”under the water.
; Kicking, biting, slugging, and the use
|of lead pipe is prohibited; but the
| judges are said to be rather lenient in
this respect.
The object of the game is to swim
j holding on to the ball and touch it to
the opposite side of the pool without
j being ducked. One can pass as in regu
! lar football, and to kick you throw but
| announce it as a kick beforehand.
Substitutions occur often, at the re-
I quest of players.
