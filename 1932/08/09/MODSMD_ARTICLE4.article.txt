# DOWNES TRACES ORCHESTRA RISE
## Leader Originally Beat Time At Harpischord 
### 
Imagine an orchestra playing a com
plete series of symphonies and short
selections without the visible aid of a
conductor, and you will have the con
ception of the modern orchestra a
hundred years ago, Olin Downes ex
plained in his lecture Monday after
noon.
"A conductor would be seated at a
harpischord and only indicate time,"
Downes said. "He gave no more actual
though to an emotional interpretation
then than the modern conductor would
give the thought of its absence. Both
would consider the other's ideas ab
surd."
Bach Amazed Contemporaries
Downes indicated the fact that Bach
was as amazing in his day as is the
modern composer today. There was a
trend toward the use of the strings as
solo instruments, and a subordination
of wood and brass as a background
accompaniment.
The development of the orchestra is
essentially a development parallel to
that of human consciousness, the critic
maintained. In the 18th century every
thing was patterned upon a classic
scale of line and movement. Color was
as unheard of as the modem trend was
unexpected. According to Downes it
simply occurred.
Orchestral Direction at High Peak
"Berlioz, Wagner, and Liszt brought
about such a complete revolution of
orchestration that to express their in
fluence would be practically impos
sible," Downes stated. 'They gave birth
to a complete new melodic panorama,
and the instruments divided them
selves into four voices, lending color to
production."
There is nothing so sensitive in mod
ern music as the orchestra, Downes
believes. And probably modern orches
tral direction has reached a higher
peak than ever before, even including
Wagner and the French school. Today
we seem to get the cream of European
conductors because of the competitive
basis upon which we set music.
