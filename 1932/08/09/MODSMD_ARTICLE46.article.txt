## BEN EASTMAN AND TWO OLYMPIC RACES 
### 
Would Ben Eastman have been able
to run both the 400 and 800 meter
races in the Olympics?
Dink Templeton and other track ex
perts believed not, feeling that the
strain of heats and finals of two races
might be too much for the "Blazer."
And to top it all off with a lap in the
relay would have been unthinkable.
It is interesting to note, however,
that one man did run in three events,
and finished "in the money" in all of
them. It was Alex Wilson of Canada,
and though he is a fast man, he does
not come up to Big Ben's standard.
Yet he ran these races, and was ap
parently none the worse for his strenu
ous workout.
Wilson had the fallowing week's
schedule: 800 trials on Sunday; 800
finals, in which he placed second, Tues
day; two 400 trials, Thursday; 400 trials
and finals, in which he got third, Fri
day; a lap in the 1600 relay trials Sat
urday; and a lap in the finals, in which
the Canucks took third, on Sunday.
