# BENTEL BENDS BIKE ON CURB IN QUEST FOR "MORE SPEED"
## 
### 
Dwight E. Bentel, 528 Alvarado Row,
i is a newshawk. At high school he had
j "Speed" inserted after the "E."
i Last week he decided walking was
[ too slow. Of course Bentel is a fast
j walker. When he was a Boy Scout he
| won a merit badge for hiking. He
: walked when he went out for track,
| too. The coach, it seems, didn't appre
! ciate his ability, though. The other boys
I ran.
Anyway Bentel borrowed Calvin
j Coover's motorcycle.
| ''These," Bentel declaimed," are a
i cinch to ride. I'll learn in a week."
On the first day things went well.
Bentel took his steed to Palo Alto. He
, ate onions. They made him strong. He
i drove back to the campus at GO miles
! per hour.
But the second day was disastrous.'
| Bentel told Coover he could ride "no
! handed." Even Smedley Butler, who is
' a marine and learned to ride a motor
: bike in the service, wouldn't try that,
j He used both hands.
Bentel took the left hand off. It was
a cinch. He took the other hand off.
j Something happened. The "bike" made
| for the curb. Bentel made for a front
j lawon on Alvarado Row. He hurtled the
| sidewalk in the process. Today he is
I walking. Coover is repairing his cycle.
