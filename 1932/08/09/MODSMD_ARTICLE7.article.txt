# DR. RUSSELL WILL PRESENT ART AND REALITY LECTURE
## Acting Philosophy Professor To Speak Tonight In Little Theatre 
### 
The force of scicnce as a factor tend
ing to depreciate the value of art as a
means of bringing us more closely into
touch with the real world will be the
theme of a lccturc oy "Art and Real
ity" to be given by Dr. Leonard J. Rus
sell at 8 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. Dr. Russell is acting professor
of philosophy from the University of
Birmingham, England.
Art Values Subject
Questions such as whether to look
on the artist merely as a person who
ministers to our enjoyment, and who
provides a way of temporary escape
from the hard realities of life, or a
person who produces work of much
greater significance will be considered.
â€¢ In the latter part of the lecture Dr.
Russell will compare art and science,
attempting to discover whether they
have anything in common. In this con
nection he will discuss the feasibility
of studying art with the object of
throwing some light on the nature of
science, and of studying science to un
derstand the nature of art.
