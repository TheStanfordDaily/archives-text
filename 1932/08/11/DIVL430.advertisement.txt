"ISING IS, unconsciously to
you perhaps, your steadfast friend. It
makes friends of you and for you. It is
constantly offering valuable assistance
by introducing worthy merchandise to
you.
The advertisements in the "Stanford
Daily" are placed there by firms which
have quality goods to offer you. They
have put themselves on record in the
pages of this newspaper. They know
that their goods will stand inspection—
that they will live up to the claims made
for them. They invite your comparison.
Any firm which seeks your patronage
through the printed page knows that
what he sells must give satisfaction—
for even advertising cannot sell an un- '
worthy product twice. Depend upon
advertised products and you will obtain
quality.
