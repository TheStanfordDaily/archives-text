# RUSSELL POINTS OUT RELATION OF ART TO REALITY
## English Philosopher Dwells Upon Conception Of Art In 17th Century Discusses Common Elements In Art And Science; Gives Modern Viewpoint 
### 
Dr. Leonard J. Russell, lecturing
Tuesday evening at the Little Theatre
on "Art and Reality," discussed the
possibility of finding common elements
in science and art which would give
them a similarity of connection with
reality. The lecturer, who is acting pro
fessor of philosophy from the Univer
sity of Birmingham, England, presented
the 17th century conception of the re
lation of art and reality, and by use of
illustrations, explained the changes in
this conception.

During the 17th century, the philo
sopher stated, art and science had
nothing in common in their relation to
actuality. Reality, he defined as either
matter or mind, and art as the pre
sentation of appearance thx-ough color,
sound, and other such mediums. Many
people still hold this conception.
Changing Conception
Art gained a new significance when
Ihe public realized that, instead of
recognizing the artist, the public might
be recognized by the artist, or learn to
see reality from his viewpoint. Pr. Rus
sell explained this by contrasting the
impression a house makes on an or
dinary man and the impression it
makes on an artist.
The artist may see the whole as a
peculiar example of the play of light,
and this is what he puts in his picture.
The ordinary man sees windows, steps,
grass in the yard, and other material
features.
Artist's Viewpoint
According to Dr. Russell, "The artist
concentrates on the effective realization
of an idea, recasting things which have
to him the greatest emotional signifi
cance." Now, if the ordinary man can
come to understand this picture, he is
seeing reality through art.

In the sciences a similar policy is
followed; that is, the key to under
standing the actual is a perfect form,
a pure case, and from this a study of
the actual can be developed. In geome
try, economics, and arithmetic, we fol
low the demands of the intellect in
producing a perfect form. From an un
derstanding of this comes understand
ing of reality.
