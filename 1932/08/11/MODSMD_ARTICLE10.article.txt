# Dr. Lewin Discusses Childhood Conflicts
## German Psychologist Illustrates How Problems Develop When Child Faces Two Strong Desires 
### 
Eight-months-old Matilde sees a
rattle, builds up a desire for it, and
tries desperately to grasp it. Two-year
old Kirwin creeps up a terrace with a
ball, becomes ,exasperated because she
drops it, and firmly grasping the ball
in her hand, climbs the stairway up
right for the first time in her life.

Thus does childhood face its conflict 1
situations and, after a trial and error
method, solve them advantageously, !
according to Dr. Kurt Lewin, visiting
professor of psychology, who presented 1
these case histories Wednesday after- 1
noon in the Little Theatre.
Situations Observed Early
"In the first few months of the j
child's .life," Di\ Lewin said, "conflict j
situations may be observed. These situ- |
ations arise when the child is caught i
between two desires."

pictures of an eight-months-old infant. I
A rattle was placed upon a table, out j
of her reach. The child wanted the 1

rattle and, crawling after it, finally
picked it up.
Then another conflict arose. Thej
child already had a rattle in her hand,
and now with two, was undetermined
what to do with both of them. The
problem was easily solved, though. She j
became interested in her shoe instead.
What Causes Embarrassment?
Adults, it seems, as well as children, j
are troubled by this situation. But ac- ;
cording to Dr. Lewin embarrassment j
results from an exposed social position, j
or a personal conflict. And so fidgeting j
is indulged in to cover up the mental
nervousness and mental discomfort. !
Too, the conspicuous feeling causes the
desire to hide behind someone, he J
added.
Illustrating this point, a four-year- j
old child, playing happily before her
teacher, was flashed on the screen. The
child was cheerful, and ill at ease. In
short, she felt conspicuous and used
these tactics as a defensive mechanism !
to cover up her nervousness.
