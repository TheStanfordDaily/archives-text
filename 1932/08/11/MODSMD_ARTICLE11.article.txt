# DOWNES TO LECTURE ON LATIN MUSIC
## Continues Series With Talk On Spanish Composer 
### 
Olin Downes will continue his
Thursday evening series of lectures to
morrow with a talk on De Falla and
Spanish music. This composer, per
haps the outstanding Spaniard of his
time, has written an enormous amount
of music, although his best works are
comparatively unknown to the general
public in this country.

The lecture will be at 7:30 o'clock in
the Little Theatre. The change in lo
cation from the Assembly Hall is ef
fective only for the single talk, al
though the time will continue to be
the same throughout the remainder of
the series.
Igor Stravinsky, modernist and clas
sicist, will be the subject of the Mon
day afternoon lecture by Downes. The
critic will discuss the effect of this
composer's work upon the modern Eu
ropean schools of composition and ex
pression. The Monday lecture will be
at 4:15 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
