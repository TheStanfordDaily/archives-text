# OLD BOY OUT FOR BLOOD 1932-33 Chappies Go On Sale SAVAGE SEEKS SHEKELS
## 
### 
The Old Boy goes out for blood next
week.
Of course, you can't squeeze blood
out of a turnip, but the Old Boy re
fuses to believe that any Stanford stu
dents can be called turnips, or that a
measly sum of $2 can be called blood.
Especially when, in return for the
aforementioned pittance, the wise man
or woman will receive Chaparral, that
foremost of all college comics, for the
coming year.

Bob Savage, the Old Boy's trusty
business assistant, will have subscrip
tion tables set up at both the English
and Engineering corners on next Tues
day, Wednesday, and Thursday. Those
who subscribe now will be sure of get
ting the first copy of Chappie next fall
right on the dot, instead of having to
run around frantically in October,
seeking for someone to sign them up.
Foresight is one of the greatest of hu
man virtues, and exceedingly virtuous
will be those wHo write out their
checks (or if you want to pay cash
and save two cents, you misers, it's
O.K. with the Old Boy) next week.

Chaparral is published by Hammer
and Coffin, national college comic fra
ternity, and is issued nine times a year.
The Old Boy's shoes next year will be
filled by Don '"Bleater" Cameron, and
he will be assisted by such notoriously
funny men as Berk Anthony, Bob
Churchill, Bernarr Bates, James Algar,
North Baker, Fred Coonradt, Don
Douglass, Fritz Goodwin, Jack Keerl,
Rollin Pickford, Gordon Steedman,
Frank Thomas, Neal Van Sooy, and
Hal von Breton.

The watchdog of Hammer and Cof
fin's treasury is Savage (and that's no
pun, either. There's not a pun in a
carload of Chappies, and that ought
to be an inducement to any of you who
still need inducing). He will be most
ably assisted by Rosemary Clarke and
Bob Anderson, both of whom wear no
man's collar, so the yoke's ori you, not
them. (That slipped—it won't happen
again if enough of you subscribe next
week.)
