# Fiery Meteors Will Blaze At 3:00 Tonight
## Star Display To Be At Best After Moon Goes Down 
### 
"Three o'clock in the morning" will
be the popular song tonight for those
who want to see the star shower at
its best. The moon will go down at
midnight Thursday, and the brilliance
of the •meteoric display will be at its
peak about three hours later.
The flaming stars are the Perseid
meteors, and this is the occasion of
their annual summer visit to Mother
Earth. Usually, however, too much
moonlight interferes with the display,
but tonight the moon is being consid
erate and retiring early.
Meteors Form Oval Ring
The Perseids form a vast eliptical
ring of cosmic dust, each speck esti
mated to be about the size of a grain
of wheat. The ring is approximately
two billion miles in circumference and
50.000,000 miles wide. The meteors
come from the direction of the con
stellation Perseus, from which they
derive their name, and once a year
the earth passes through the thickest
portion of the. ring.
The Perseids fall at a rate of 15 to
50 an hour, but they are probably
burnt out before they reach the earth,
for there is no record of any of the
meteors having reached here red-hot.
They burst into flaming rockets GO
miles above our sphere, and travel at
a rate of 1,200 miles an hour.

ites wish to get out pencils and pa

Penn astronomers will appreciate it,
and all that.
