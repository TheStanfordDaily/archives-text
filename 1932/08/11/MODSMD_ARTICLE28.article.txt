# THEY AIN'T DONE RIGHT BY OUR BEN

For waul of a shoo, a horse was lost;
For waul of a horse, a kingdom was losl.
And for want of a meeting, two records wore lost.
Because the records committee of the American Athletic
Union does not hold its regular meeting until November, Ben
Eastman's new marks in the 110 and <X<S() cannot he recognized
as ollicial world's records until liKil.
Any new mark made in the United Slates must he recom
mended by the A.A.I , before the International Amateur Ath
letic Federation can approve it. Had the American committee
met after the Olympic team trials at Stanford, it could have
presented Eastman's times at the I.A.A.F. meeting in Los
Angeles. Because it chose to adhere to a set schedule instead,
Ben will have to wait two years for ollicial recognition.
There is one bright side. The I.A.A.F. does not need the
A.A.U.'s recomendalion for marks made in the Olympic (lames,
so Hill Miller's pole vault was accepted as a new world's record,
even though Bill (iraber has gone three inches higher.
But what's the use of being called a world's record-holder,
when you know that someone else has bettered your mark?
And what's the use of setting new records, and then waiting
more than two years to have them recognized?
The A.A.U. apparently thinks more of time schedules than
it does of American athletes. "They ain't done right" by our
Ben, nor by any of the other United Stales stars who broke or
equalled world's records this year.
