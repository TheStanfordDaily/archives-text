# MEET MR. MENCKEN
## 
### 
To I lie greater glory of 11. L. Mencken and for llie entcrtain
menl of his customers, Hit 1 American Mercury for lliis month
carries the note headed: "Progress of I lie higher learning at
Stanford Iniversitv, the pride and glory of the Pacific Coast,"
and following this flavored comment is "The lirst fishing class
instituted at an American university began its course of instruc
tion here today."
There is no objection to finding news several months past in
Mr. Mencken's vehicle, the self-styled critic of American "Boob
cry." Ordinarily the I niversitv should appreciate the mention.
In this case, however, there is more to the story. And
whether the magazine's policy favors flycasting in the college
curriculum or not, it might bear out its feigned attitude of
searching frankness by checking up on the facts of what it
prints rather than relying upon antiquated press reports.
Stanford has since its founding made physical education
compulsory upon students for the tirst two years. In this policy
there has been a definite purpose, that of acquainting students
with sports which Ihev may enjoy through life. Such games as
tennis, swimming, polo, and fishing are included in this pro
gram.
From this light the sport of fishing takes its place in a laud
able program of physical education, long since adopted bv
numerous colleges over the country.
Ethically, the Mercury blundered. Rut to its superior minded
stall'goes the credit of holding consistent to a policy of pander
ing to readers who are willing to form their impressions on
half truths.
