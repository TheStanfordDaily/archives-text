CYNARA—Geary Theatre. Now play
ing.
In playing the delightfully human
characterization of Jim Warlock, bar
rister, Philip Merivale did not belie
flattering press notices, past or present,
with his performance in Cynara. H. M.
Harwood and R. F. Gore-Browne wrote
the play, from Gore-Browne's novel,
"An Imperfect Lover."
This fellow Jim has his troubles, the
same troubles over which the Greeks
pondered—"women," and the result an
affair which mixes him up in a nasty
mess at an inquest. Reaching the dan
gerous age after seven years of har
monious married life Jim strays and
strays far. At the cost of his career,
and almost losing the love of his wife
he shields the memory of the girl in
the triangle.
Mr. Merivale makes Jim a very lov
able person, shy, awkward with
women; awkward in talking to them,
but at home in their hearts which he
cannot help winning with his tender
manly charm.
Nancy Sheridan, playing the role of
the disturbing element in the triangle,
is convincingly sincere in her pursuit
of Jim. Phoebe Foster, as Clemency
Warlock, Jim's wife, does a nice piece
of work. The Honorable John Tring,
as played by Sir Guy Standing, is
splendid as an amusing old conqueror
ot women's hearts who frequently de
lights with his philosophic comments
gained from a life fully lived.
Comparable to the potent drama
found in Dreiser's "An American
Tragedy" in its emotional background
this play will give you a significant
understanding of the loves and weak
nesses of mature man and woman.

DESTRY RIDES AGAIN—At the Men
lo Theater. .
Of especial interest to Stanfordites is
this picture, which brings Tom Mix
back to the screen's open spaces. Sev
eral months ago Mix underwent an
appendectomy, and wasn't expected to
pull through. To save his life copious
quantities of a rare serum were need
ed. And it was the Stanford bacteri
ology department that came to the res
cue with flasks of "bacteriophage."
That serum must have been potent.
Mis, despite his age, leaps, shoots,
runs, and jumps with reckless aban
don. The plot is quite "horsey," what
with the boss Tony prancing about.
The villains are mean, unkempt cut
throats; the heroine is a saccharine
fluff of feminity; the hero is virile and
stalwart. And the hero gets the girl
and the villians end up as vulture fod
der. What more do you want in a
Western? —E.L.
SOUTH SKA ADVENTURES, MIL
LION DOLLAR LEGS—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Purple patches and pampa passion
skyrocketed Zane Grey into fame as
a writer. His yarns always smacked of
the imaginative hallucinations of a
fisherman. In his South Sea Adven

lures 6rey is the hero. His exploits are
backed up with authentic, thrilling
shots, and the line he wields is as
facile as his pen.
A conglomeration of comedians run
rampant through Million Dollar Legs,
and debunk the Olympic Games. It's
just a typical two-reel short, but com
plications must have set in and it
swelled up to six reels. —E.L.

WHAT WE LIVE BY—By Abbe Er
nest Dimnet. Simon & Schuster.
lf>32. 52.!)0. /It the Stanford Book
store.
Dimnet's previous book, "The Art of
Thinking," was one of this country's
most remarkable best-sellers. For
some reason, completely unfathomable
to many of us, the volume caught the
popular fancy and sold out edition
after edition. Perhaps people thought
that it was a prescription which would
enable them to think clearly and con
cisely; perhaps—well, anyway, it was
a best-seller.
Now the good Abbe comes out with
a second book, "What We Live By."
This work has the advantage of being
more pertinent to everyday problems
than its predecessor, and should make
an even stronger appeal. It may not,
though, for the book-buying public is
notoriously whimsical, and no pub
lisher or critic can foretell a volume's
fate. "The Good Earth" was sent forth
with no ballyhoo, and it became a best
seller; "Trader Horn's" second attempt
was enthusiastically advertised, but
never reached first base.
Nevertheless, whether it becomes as
popular or not, this book is better than
the first, and easier to understand.
Dimnet is still behind the tempo of
modern times, but is catching up. We
optimistically await his third trial, and
hope for the charm. —N.V.S.
