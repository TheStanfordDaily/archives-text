## 
### 

Brought on, no doubt, by current "hard times," a new kind of market has
sprung into being In New York, and is probably doing more "business" than
any other market in the world. It is known as nn "exchange market," but is
more littingly culled the "swap market." It started in a tiny snot beneath
the steel structure of the Willlaiusburgh bridge, at Delancey and nidge streets,
and has spread out considerably with the daily increasing demand for trade.
In probably nine-tenths of thejbusiness done beneath the bridge, money takes
do part. Any possession of a prospective trader can be exchanged for some
thing In the stock of the market, provided of course, its value does not ex
ceed the value oi' the article desired bv the customer
