# I.A.A.F. PRESENTS TITLE TO MILLER
## Card Star's Pole Vault Mark Is Officially Recognized 
### 
Bill Miller may have been beaten in
! the Olympic tryouts by Bill Graber,
but he will hold the world's record in
!he pole vault for at least two years.
At a special meeting of the Interna
i tional Amateur Athletic Federation
; this week, Miller's mark of 14 feet l?n
inches, made in the Olympic Games,
; was recognized as the official world
record. As the Federation will not
I meet again until 1934, Bill will be the
official holder until then, and will hold
i the Olympic record for at least four
1 years.
Hec Dyer, ex-Stanford sprinter, is
I now the co-holder of a record, the
j time of 40 seconds in the 400 meter
i relay having been approved by the
I Federation.
At the same time, two Stanford rec
j ords were discarded. Bud Spencer's
! mark of 47 seconds in the 400 meter
run was broken by Bill Carr's time of
40.2. The Penn runner also knocked
j another Cardinal record aside when he
i ran a fast lap on the 1,600 meter relay
, team that set a new mark of 3:08.2,
j which betters by more than four sec
onds the record made by Ben Eastman,
lAI and Les Hables, and Maynard
Shove in Fresno last year.
j Ben Eastman suffered the same fate
|as Bill Graber in having his record
j breaking achievements of this year
I recognized. The American Amateur
Athletic Union has to recommend such
| marks for acceptance, and as this body
will not meet until November, the In
ternational Federation cannot pass on
i them until 1934.
