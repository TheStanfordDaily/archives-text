## DANA BREAKS OUT AGAIN WITH GRAPHIC GAME ACCOUNT 
### 
Well, well, one can almost feel (he
familiar chilling autumn breezes, with
their threat of rain, after reading Herb
Dana's graphic account of the Olympic
exhibition football game in yesterday
morning's Examiner. It's old, bul it
still may he news to some that 1931
varsity men from Stanford, California,
and Southern Cal teamed up to beat a
bunch of boys from Yale, Harvard, and
Princeton, 7 to (i. Not since January
have sport fans encountered one of the
fiery Dana's game post-mortems in
their breakfast newspaper, and it's a
welcome sign of fall, like the falling
leaves.
The significant thing about the
popular Pacific Coast referee's
story, however, is his statement
concerning the new football rules,
which so into effect this season. To
quote from Dana's yarn: "The new
rules were used and the game
clicked in regular IJKJI fashion.
Several times a hall carrier was
knocked t<Â» the ground, not tackled,
and the play stopped. This is a
rule change. The offense
stopped with the referee's whistle,
as did the defensive players, and
there was no piling on the man
with the hall."
It may be remembered that the new
rules met with none too hearty ap
proval at Stanford last spring, nor
throughout the Conference, for that
matter. Pacific Coast coaches may re
verse their opinions this fall, if the
new rules suit Dana, for the colorful
Herb likes his football plenty rough,
we have observed.
