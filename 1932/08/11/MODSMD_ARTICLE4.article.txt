# TWO NETWORKS WILL BROADCAST HOOVER SPEECH
## 
### 
Both the National and Colum
bia systems will broadcast Presi
dent Herbert Hoover's acceptance
talk tonight. WEAF-NBC will take
the program at 9 o'clock (6 p.m.
Pacific time), and WABC-CBS
will start 15 minutes later.

Interest in Mr. Hoover's mes
sage centers chiefly in his attitude
on prohibition and the possible
repeal of the 18th Amendment.
His interpretation of the plank in
the Republican platform will ne
cessarily become the basis for the
future campaign.

Upon his arrival in Washington
for the notification ceremonies,
Everett Sanders, chairman of the
Republican National Committee,
predicted that President Hoover
would be re-elected "by a large
majority."
