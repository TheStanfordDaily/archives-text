# GOT A FIN? LET’S GO TO THE DOGS

Now that the Belmont and South
San Francisco (pardon me, Baden) dog
tracks have opened, any student who's
the proud possessor of a fin (which is
five smacks to you, Mrs. Schnitz) and
a yen for. gambling can have a good
time at these canine Olympics. It's in
teresting to note that options are being
redeemed on the winners at the same
surprising rates which prevailed last
spring. The strong element of uncer
tainty in these races, due, no doubt,
to the fact that a racing hound is still
fundamentally a dog, is responsible for
these generous option redemptions.
Personally, we always liked the r
horses better than dogs. But then,
when we were losing our cigarette
money at Tanforan last April, we
knew a couple of guys who cleaned
up big at Belmont. Well, you take
your pick, if you have five dollars
—five dollars you're going to roll
down a sewer.
