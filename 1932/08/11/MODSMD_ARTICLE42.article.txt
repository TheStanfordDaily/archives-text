# GEORGIA WINS, SHOWS BACK TO HUNGARIAN JUDGE
## 
### 
America's girl friends won the wom
en's diving championships at Los An
geles yesterday afternoon, but they
had to don last year's suit models to
do it. Dr. Leo Donath, Hungarian div
ing judge, objected to the low-backed
suits worn by Georgia Coleman, first
place winner, and Jane Fauntz, who
took third. So the girls had to retire
to the dressing rooms and beg, bor
row, or steal new suits before the com
petition could go on. —And after all
those new reels we've seen of the latest
swim suit styles in Europe!
