# Built to Fly in the Stratosphere
## 
### 

This is the F-1000-1, France's first stratoplane built by Henry Farnuin with support of the government, which
was given its first test near Versailles recently in the presence of many aviation experts. The plane is designed to
attain a speed up to ,'575 miles an hour Hying at altitudes above 00,000 feet. It is chiefly distinguished from an ordi
nary monoplane by its great wingspread and by the air compressors attached to the fuselago enabling flyers and motor
to breathe compressed stratosphere air. It is hoped that a trip from Paris to New York may be lunde in less than
10 hours in the new plane.
