# Maloney Gives Slant On Games
## Tells Facts In 10,000 Meter Finn-Hill Mixup 
### 
Interesting sidelights on the 1932
Olympics were ottered by Harry Ma- i
loney, ex-Card track coach and diree- j
tor of minor sports at Stanford, upon

son's winning the 800-meter race. "Ben

meters pushed Carr to set a world's J
record and the selection of Ben for j
this race was a commendable decision." i
Describes Alleged Foul
Ben never ran better, in Maloney's
