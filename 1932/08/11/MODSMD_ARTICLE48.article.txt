## 
### 
United States-British Empire meet ,
stuck wits boosted considerably yester- 1
day by the announcement lhat six of
Ihe outstanding members of Japan's
; Olympic team well compete in exhibi- \
j tion events at the U.S.A.-United King-
I dom championships in Kezar Stadium i
1 Sunday afternoon. The entire Nippon- j
; ese team, some 20 strong, will be visi
' tors at the San Francisco post-Olym
i piyd classic.

| and jump in Los Angeles of 51 feet j

! Sprinters Withdraw
At the same time yesterday's an
nouncement of the withdrawal of sev
eral American stars appears to weaken
the United States team materially,
promising a more closely contested, al
though perhaps not so spectacular meet
j as San Francisco track fans have an-
I tieipated.
j Particularly in the sprint-relay de
partment has the withdrawal bugaboo
! weakened the American squad. "Bullet
! Bob" Kiesel of California will be out
I with a strained muscle, while Hec
' Dyer, Eddie Tolan, Frank Wykoff, and
| George Simpson have all decided
| they've done enough sprinting for the
! year and have hung up their spikes
I v/iih a convincing air of finality.
Montague to Run
Lawson Robertson, head coach of the
American team, has a big problem be
; fore him in attempting to fill ade
i quately the vacancies left in his sprint
| relay teams by these withdrawals,
i Kalph Montague, San Francisco U.
sprint star, who missed qualifying for
tiie Olympic team, seems slated to run
one of the laps of the 40-meter relay,
; with Robertson's two remaining Olym
| pic team sprinters, Emmett Toppino
I and Ralph Metcalfe.
The exact roster of the American
entry at Kezar will not be known defi
nitely until the team arrives in San
Francisco this morning. The entire
British team of 72 athletes will also
arrive today, and will make headquar
ters at the Clift Hotel, with workouts
scheduled for Kezar Friday and Satur
; day.
Thrills Promised
In spite of America's rapidly fading
array of sprinters, the meet at Kezar
promises Bay fans their first taste of
international track competition, Olym
pic flavor. And Olympic flavor it will
| be, for the British are coming, bringing

with them the Olympic stars of Greal
Britain, Canada, South Africa, Austra
lia, and New Zealand.
Outstanding among the British Em
pire athletes are Walter Hampson, 800-
meter champion of the Los Angeles
Games in new world's record time;
Lieutenant Rampling, 400-meter star,
who forced Bill Carr to a 46.2 seconds
lap in the 1600-meter relay; Phil Ed
wards, Canadian negro, who placed
third to Hampson in the 800; Gold
ing, Australian 400-meter threat; Stone
ly, British dark horse in the middle
distance races; and Alex Wilson, Maple
leaf champion in the 400 and 800.
Bright spots in the United States
lineup will be Toppino and Metcalfe;
Ablowich, Fuqua, and Warner of the
record-smashing 1600-meter relay
quarter; Ralph Hill, second-place win
ner in the 10,000 meters run; Beard and
Saling, two of America's premier hurd
lers; Joe McCluskey, Fordham boy who
