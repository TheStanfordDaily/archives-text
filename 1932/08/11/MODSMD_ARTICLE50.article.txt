# CHILDREN HELPED TO REGAIN HEALTH AT STANFORD HOME
## Case Studies Show "Miracles" Effected With Needy Boys And Girls 
### 
Little Gussie Eliopolis' first name is j
Stanford, now.
About a year ago Gussie was in bad
shape with pneumonia, a lung abscess, I
and serious complications. The doctors !
had to remove five ribs in order to get |
at the abscess, and they had virtually j
no hope of saving the boy's life.
It was decided to send him to the |
Stanford Convalescent Home for a j
trial. Plenty of nourishing food, rest, i
sun baths, and outdoor sports did what
surgical .skill could not accomplish. '
There came a day when Gussie was
pronounced well, and his parents came i
to take him home. And they were so
full of gratitude over what the Home !
had done that they changed his name
to Stanford.
The files in the office of Miss Ruth
Spande, superintendent of the Home,
are full of similar case histories. There
was Dorothy from Oakland, who was
so badly burned that it was impossible
even to graft new skin on her, but a
year "on the Farm" made her well and
strong again. There was Dickie, who !
was too weak even to walk when he
was first brought down, but who left
in a few months as a bronzed young
rough. And there arc 70 children in i
the Home now, being brought back to I
health by the saving combination of
good food, outdoor life, and loving
care.
Organized in 15)1!)
Founded in 1919 \by Mr. and Mrs. j
Timothy Hopkins as a summer camp j
for convalescent boys and girls in the j
Bay Region, the Home has grown to j
its present size of four large buildings, |
with 70 beds and an annual budget of j
$6«>,000. A superintendent, seven gradu
ate nurses, and two teachers look after
(he needs of the children, while four j
members of the Stanford medical fac- j
ulty—Doctors Faber, Clark, Wilbur, j
and Roth—give of their time.
The length of stay varies from four
months to over a year. The children are
kept in bed until they are found to be
definitely gaining, when they are pro
moted to the "runabout" class. When
their once puny and sickly bodies have
been built up to normal, and their j
health restored, they are sent home
again.
Children Mate to Leave
Leaving for home is not the enjoy
able prospect to these children that it
is to the average hospitalized person.
The patients come from poor families,
with crowded quarters, insufficient food
and clothes, and lack of proper play
facilities. The Home, with its marvel
ous equipment, is a veritable fairyland
to these boys and girls, and saying
goodbye to it is far from pleasant.
But for every child who dislikes to i
leave, there are two and three who j
are anxious to enter. Seven new pa
tients are admitted each week, alter
nating between boys and girls, and this
means that seven others must leave to
make way for the incoming ones.
Modern and Complete Equipment
The physical plant of the Home is
modern and complete. One unit is the
old Stanford residence, and is used
primarily for central offices and store
rooms. The McLaughlin unit accom
modates 27, and is used as the boys'
dormitory. The Babcock unit, just
opened in March, is a duplicate of the
McLaughlin, and contains the beds for
girls. The Auxiliary Board unit is de- i
signed to take care of approximately
30 runabouts, besides rooms for the
narsing staff.
There is a $3000 playhouse for the
girls, all fixed up with running water,
electricity, a real fireplace, 'n' every
thing; a treehou.se for the boys; two
complete schoolrooms; individual lock
ers and bed tables; a miniature barber
shop and dentist's office; up-to-date
playground equipment; violet-ray
lamps for cloudy days; and toys galore.
Community Chest Agency
The Home is supported partially by j
the San Francisco Community Chest,
of which it is a member. The Com- j
munity Chest of Santa Clara county, j
Sciots, Rotarians, Junior Leagues, j
Shriners, and many other organiza- j
lions on the peninsula aid in the up- j
keep. There are also many interested
individuals who contribute generously,
both of their money and services.
Stanford contributes in several ways.
An annual drive for funds is held each
year, which nets a substantial sum. |
The election of "King" of the Masque |
Ball, at a penny a vote, is one method |
of raising money for the Home.'The
annual Labor Day is a spring quarter
feature, at which students turn out to
saw wood, make repairs, paint toys,
wash windows, and polish floors. An- j
other way in which "certain students" j
help out is through the Men's and
Women's councils, where penalties of j
several hours' work are inflicted for |
minor violations, such as wrong park- .
ing, speeding, or lockouts. Many of the
University clubs contribute sums to [
the general fund.
Benny Thinks "It's Swell"
Here's four-year-old Benny in one |
bed. The nurse tells you that his par
ents are flagrant lawbreakers, and the j
patrol wagon pays many visits to his
homo. Once, shortly after he came to
the Home, an ambulance drove up,
clanging its bell. Benny dove under
the covers, yelling, "Scra-a-m! It's de
cops!"
But look at Benny now. clad in white I
trunks and a white sailor hat, his |
tanned body filling out like a normal
boy's once more.
"How about it, Benny, do you like it
all right down here at the Stanford
Home?"
"You bet! Gee, it's swell.'
