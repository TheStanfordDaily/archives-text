# "AL NATURAL" CAST PRESENTS SPANISH DRAMATIC SUCCESS
## 
### Eleanora Bosworth 
The socially elite of sophisticated
Madrid and the simple charm of Span
ish country life were characteristically
portrayed in "A1 Natural," the play
presented last night by the Spanish
department.
Perhaps the character most at case
and most satisfying was that of Frances
Slanina's Marquesa, though the hand
some young Joaquin, portrayed by
Frank Dorsey, and the crude but good
hearted Demetrio vied her for honors.
Anita, portrayed by Catherine Mu
sante in her strategies for Joaquin's
favors was a trifie vivacious, and Mary
Osmons as Pilar personified a sweet
ness lacking in feeling.
Among the performances tempered
with co-operation and good character
portrayal were those of Professor Es
pinosa, Marian Wilson, and Alice Eas
ton.
On the whole the play was most
satisfying and showed competent di
recting by Miss Trinidad de Mora, and
an excellent supporting cast.
Only one out of every 200 American
men reach a height of six feet.
