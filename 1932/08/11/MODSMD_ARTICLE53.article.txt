# OIL MART OPENS HERE
## 
### 
The city of Palo Alto boasts of be
ing the home of The Oil Mart, whose
; manager, J. W. Bonds, claims it to be
the first cash and carry merchandiz
ing oil station in America. The prin
ciple of this concern is to sell oil to
: the consumer at a rate which is con
[ siderably lower than prices of today.
The main features of The Oil Mart
which make it unique arc that it ships
its Pennsylvania oil through the Pan
ama Canal as ballast in tankers; it runs
no washing, greasing, battery, ignition,
! nor tire service department at the sta
tion; and it sells oil to the public in
5-gallon cans. For these reasons the
consumer does not pay for transpor
tation rates, salaries and other miscel
laneous expenses, all of which are nec
essarily attached to the ordinary prices
of oil.â€”Adv.
