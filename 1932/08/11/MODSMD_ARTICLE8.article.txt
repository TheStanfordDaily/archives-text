# Northwestern Finds Many Geniuses For Prodigy Class
## 
### 
Officials of Northwestern University
are having a hard time choosing 20
students for the experimental "prod
igy class." Out of 50 child geniuses
who applied for admission, only four
of the 10 boys and two of the 10 girls
have been chosen so far. The remain
ing candidates are so evenly matched
in scholarship ability, that the investi
gators have been unable to choose
among them.
