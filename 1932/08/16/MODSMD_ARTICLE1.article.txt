# PRESENT CRISIS IS A STIMULANT SAYS DR. WILBUR
## Cabinet Member Says Money Pressure Making College Men Think Declares Student Interest In Politics Greatest Since 1896 Campaign 
### 
Finding himself a factor in the eco
nomic side of affairs 4ias been the
greatest stimulus in years to the in
terest and energy of the university
student is the substance of an opinion
voiced by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
president of Stanford and Secretary of
the Interior. Secretary Wilbur, who is
making a tour of inspection of govern
ment projects in the Northwest and
Pacific Coast regions, is at present in
his office at the Administration Build
ing.

Secretary Wilbur explained that stu
dents are feeling the pressure of hard
times, both in the difficulty of getting
through school and in getting a job
when out of school. No more are there
long lists of jobs awaiting the.graduate
of every department, but, instead, a
battle to find any place in the present
economic situation.
Political Interest High
Political interest among students,
Secretary Wilbur believes, is at its
highest peak since the campaign of
1896. At that time the nomination of
Bryan was the reason for the students'
eagerness to participate in policitis.
Speaking in the same vein as when
talking of the student interest in eco
nomics, Secretary Wilbur attributes the
growing political interest among uni
versity men and women to a realiza
tion of the importance of politics in
their lives, and the value a knowledge
of politics will give them in forming
constructive opinions.

Political radicals in the University,
members of the Thomas-for-President
Club and Communists, are a natural
occurrence in a university group, re
gardless of the year and the times.
Secretary Wilbur compared them to a
"cocklcbur which serves as a pin to. a
thinking majority. Most of them out
grow this stage," he said, "but some
of them never do."
Speaks for Community Chest
Both Secretary and Mrs. Wilbur en
joy reading the Stanfoijd Daily, and
regard it as one means of keeping in
touch with University affairs. Secre
tary Wilbur spoke of seeing the paper
at the White House, but he has never
chanced to see President Hoover read
ing a copy. He affirmed that his ac
quaintance with the routine problems
of the University was slight, at the
same time he commended Acting
President R. E. Swain on his manage
ment.
Secretary Wilbui has no definite
plans to announce. He spoke over the
radio from San Francisco on Sunday
concerning "The Community Chest."
