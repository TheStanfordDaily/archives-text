# "Alison's House" Is Success On Campus
## Cast Gets Hearty Applause for Characterizations in Pulitzer Prize Play; Rosenblatt Outstanding 
### BOB SCHAUF 
Greeted with applause that was
something more than hollow formality,
the play "Alison's House," as written
by Susan Glaspell, and presented Fri
day night, truly justified the daring
and confidence which Frederick Stover,
director, held in himself and his cast.
Many who were prejudiced by a pre
vious dislike for the text of the story,
have been generous in their approval
of the Stanford production.
It was a big job well done, at times
rising to heights comparable to those
reached on the professional stage.
Two fine sets, the work of Stover,
were as delightfully effective as the
well-chosen costumes, both of which
made the cast and audience equally at
home in the atmosphere of the late
nineties.
Entire Cast a Unit
The story unfolding the life of Ali
son, the immortal love poetess, through
the several members of the Stanhope
family, served to bring out the best in
the cast. Alison, though passed out of
the world for eighteen years, was made
to live with a reality gradually built
up through those who had known her.
One of the features marking the suc
cess of this play, a feature rarely en
joyed by most amateur productions, is
revealed in the fact that the cast per
formed as a life-like unit. No one char
acter stole the show.
, However, the performance of Irving
Rosenblatt, Jr., as John Stanhope,
stands out as distinctive. With one of
the best voices on the stage he made
John a very real person in spite of his
settled ways.
As Agatha Stanhope, Dorothea John
ston carried out a vital part by remain
ing in the character of the frail and
aged sister, and assumed guardian of
Alison's works.
Nancy Roberts made Elsa a convinc
ingly distracted prodigal. From a forced
outsider, Miss Roberts worked her way

' into the vital action with a portrayal
j of feeling that threatened for a short
; time to turn to the impassioned but
) graciously recovered to render a well
; balanced characterization.
Charles Beardsley did well as fur
nishing the comedy relief as the rash
collegian of the nineties. Within this
I part there could have been included a
little more dignity for the sake of con
i trast, for even rattle-brained youth has
its more serious moments.
Joe Wolf, as the restless brother
Eben, drove home his sarcasm with
i convincing force. His stage presence
j and his voice mark him as a compe
tent actor.
Louise, as played by Frances Slanina,
I bears out the opinion (hat this play
| was well cast. Miss Slanina was as
I appropriately rabid in her action as she
I was bitter in her lines.
Margery Mullen Good
Though not a leading role, that of
' Ann was well taken by Margery Mul
len. Much of the real Ann was lost in
i a sainted sweetness which might have
| been capitalized, had the poet-reporter,
j as played by Richard Knowles, shown
! more animation in negotiating the
, matrimonial merger. However, report
ers of those days were not rated the
j gin-guzzling worldlings of today.
1 Other minor parts were those of
! Aurabelle Carter and Cary Odell as
! Mr. and Mrs. Hodges who proposed to
| "sorta cheer the old place up" with a
1 splash of red and yellow, for their
| summer boarder trade. Virginia Vogt
as the old family, servant was also
! well done.
The lighting in this production stood
' out as extremely effective. It was the
j work of Robert Baxter.
The play marked a fitting climax to
! the summer quarter major produc
! tions. Had it been staged in the regu
i lar quarter it is the writer's opinion
| that it would have drawn a larger
I crowd a second night than the first.
