# MODERN INNOVATION IS ILLUSTRATED BY DE FALLA'S MUSIC
## 
### 
A thoroughly modern point in the j
development of Spanish music has i
been reached in the music of De Falla,;
Olin Downes explained in his lecture'
yesterday afternoon in the Assembly j
Hall.
"In fact, it is so modern and yet so i
Spanish that De Falla seems to have]
touched something entirely apart from |
the rest of his contemporaries," Downes j
stated. "There is a tonal coloring
throughout his works which distin-1
guishes them so obviously from other j
native music that one forgets the na
tionality portrayed and is lost in the j
music itself."
W eaves Folk Legend
Downes also pointed out the fact that
folk legend is woven throughout the
composei*'s most interesting music. De
Falla has interpreted the Spain of a
past era in modern expressionism, and
has given himself a new scope of emo
tion. Demonstrating De Falla's use of
woodwind and string sections of the
orchestra, Downes played recordings
from a macabre suite.
"One is reminded of a new freshness
which has lately come into the modern
schools of music when one hears De
Falla's folk and art music," the critic
emphasized. "Only De Falla seems to
have captured all of the beauty without I
losing himself to subordination by ob
vious orchestration."
Expresses Environment
Although Spanish music has not yet J
reached the philosophical tendencies of r |
Bach, it is expressing environment.
Spain is a country rich in legend and
romance, and within a few years
Downes believes there will be a fulller
expression introduced.
"De Falla has been a great deal
alone, and his work is himself, while
also his medium. He reveals a talent
which is beginning to assert itself with
a steadily increasing precision," Downes
said. "His music is a great step toward
a goal which is at present leather
vague." * '
