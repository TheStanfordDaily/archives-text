# MARX AT CAPITOL TO ASSUME DUTIES AS BOARD CHAIRMAN
## 
### 
Dr. Charles David Marx, professor
of civil engineering, emeritus, is in
Washington in connection with his new
duties as chairman of the advisory en
gineering board of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation.
Several requests for loans from the
newly created corporation have al
ready been presented. Dr. Marx and
his board will be called upon to pass
on the engineering problems of these
applications.
Appointment Is Protested
Among the problems is the applica
tion of the Golden Gate bridge direc
torate for a loan of $35,000,000 for con
struction of the bay span.
Because of his opposition to the
Golden Gate project, voiced two years
ago, officials of about 50 organizations
in Marin county have protested the
appointment of Dr. Marx on the
grounds that his opinion will be biased.
Formal objections have not been for
warded to Washington as yet, however,
as W. P. Filmer, president of the bridge
directors, stated that he had confidence
in the Stanford professor's integrity
and open-mindedness.
May Withdraw Objections
If assurance can be had from Dr.
Marx that he is no longer opposed to
the Golden Gate bridge, the objections
to his sitting in judgment upon the
loan application will be dropped, ac
cording to Robert A. Carey, chairman
of the advisory committee of Marvel
ous Marin, Inc.
Dr. Marx fought the bridge project
two years ago primarily on the basis
that an impartial survey should be
made by the State before any action
was taken. His stand was supported
by the Commonwealth Club of San
Francisco, the Southern Pacific-Golden
Gate Ferries Company, the Garland
Company, and other interested con
cerns. All of these groups have with
drawn their opposition to the present
program, and it is believed by Filmer
that Dr. Marx no longer has any ob
jections, especially from an engineer
ing standpoint.
