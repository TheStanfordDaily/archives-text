# "WAY OF WORLD" COMEDY READING TO END SEASON
## Sword And Sandals, English Club Play, To Be Given Tomorrow Night Charles Beardsley, Marian Jones To Have Leads; Dr. Bailey Cast 
### 
Concluding the summer scries of dra
matic readings sponsored by Sword
and Sandals ;ind the English Club, the
combined organisations will offer Wil
liam Congreve's brilliant comedy, "The
Way of the World,'' at 8 o'clock to
morrow evening in the Little Theatre.
The play, as the title indicates, con
cerns not deep emotions nor profound
interrelations of characters, but the
arts and crafts practiced by men and
women to get along in society. To gain
or save reputatino is the aim of all the
ridiculous characters in the play, and
to ruin it is the aim of all the villains.
The two chief characters, the most
charming and powerful, are persons
who are so secure that they may be
serene, or place themselves in ridicu
lous situations without the slightest
fear of losing our esteem, or that of
their own society.
Beardsley Plays Lead
This somewhat brittle point of view,
one perfectly suited to a completely
comic play, is closely comparable to
that of Molnar in such piuys as "Olym
pia" and "The Swan," or the work of
Noel Coward and Robert Sherwood.
Edward Mirabell (Charles Beardsley)
is a gentleman completely worldly, but
so much a man as to be deeply in love
with Mistress Millamant -(Marian
Jones). He has, of course, had other
passing affairs, including one with Mil
lamant's own cousin, a widow, whose
reputation he has saved before the play
begins by marrying her to Fainall (Will
Williams), a man about town. He has
also protected Mistress Fainall (Nancy
Roberts) from any x-ascality on the
part of her husband, by taking charge
of her personal fortune.
Plot Resume
At the time the play begins, Mirabell
is in hot water because old Lady Wish
fort (Dr. Margery Bailey), the mother
of Mistress Fainall and the aunt and
guardian of Millamant to whom he had
made love in order to facilitate his
courtship of Millamant, has discovered
the imposition and is furious.
To relieve the situation he plans to
introduce a new wooer to occupy her
thoughts, "Sir Rowland, an uncle of
his," who is none other than his ser
vant, Waitwell (Robert Brauns), in
disguise. He makes sure that Waitwell
cannot overstep the bounds of his real
personality, by marrying the fellow
first to Foible (Myna Hughes), Lady
Wishfort's personal maid.
Sandoc, Salt in Cast
Meanwhile Fainall, unaware that his
wife's fortune is in Mira bell's hands,
attempts to get possession of it, by
threatening to ruin his wife's reputa
tion and Lady Wishfort's. He is assisted
by shrewish Mistress Maiwood (Vir
ginia Radcliffe).
The action of the play is further
enlivened by Sir Wilful Witwoud
(James Sandoe), a country gentleman
and Lady Wishfort's candidate for Mil
lamant's hand; Wilwoud (Waldo Salt),
his foppish city cousin; and Petulant
(Matthew • Evans), a surly boor.
The cast is completed by Mincing
(Aurabelle Carter), Millamant's maid;
Peg, a stupid scullion (Julie Hopkins);
and Betty, waiting maid at a chocolate
house. Sidney Head will assist, reading
stage directions.

first to Foible (Myna Hughes), Lady
Wishfort's personal maid.
Sandoc, Salt in Cast
Meanwhile Fainall, unaware that his
wife's fortune is in Mira bell's hands,
attempts to get possession of it, by
threatening to ruin his wife's reputa
tion and Lady Wishfort's. He is assisted
by shrewish Mistress Maiwood (Vir
ginia Radcliffe).
The action of the play is further
enlivened by Sir Wilful Witwoud
(James Sandoe), a country gentleman
and Lady Wishfort's candidate for Mil
lamant's hand; Wilwoud (Waldo Salt),
his foppish city cousin; and Petulant
(Matthew • Evans), a surly boor.
The cast is completed by Mincing
(Aurabelle Carter), Millamant's maid;
Peg, a stupid scullion (Julie Hopkins);
and Betty, waiting maid at a chocolate
house. Sidney Head will assist, reading
stage directions.
Concluding the summer scries of dra
matic readings sponsored by Sword
and Sandals ;ind the English Club, the
combined organisations will offer Wil
liam Congreve's brilliant comedy, "The
Way of the World,'' at 8 o'clock to
morrow evening in the Little Theatre.
The play, as the title indicates, con
cerns not deep emotions nor profound
interrelations of characters, but the
arts and crafts practiced by men and
women to get along in society. To gain
or save reputatino is the aim of all the
ridiculous characters in the play, and
to ruin it is the aim of all the villains.
The two chief characters, the most
charming and powerful, are persons
who are so secure that they may be
serene, or place themselves in ridicu
lous situations without the slightest
fear of losing our esteem, or that of
their own society.
Beardsley Plays Lead
This somewhat brittle point of view,
one perfectly suited to a completely
comic play, is closely comparable to
that of Molnar in such piuys as "Olym
pia" and "The Swan," or the work of
Noel Coward and Robert Sherwood.
Edward Mirabell (Charles Beardsley)
is a gentleman completely worldly, but
so much a man as to be deeply in love
with Mistress Millamant -(Marian
Jones). He has, of course, had other
passing affairs, including one with Mil
lamant's own cousin, a widow, whose
reputation he has saved before the play
begins by marrying her to Fainall (Will
Williams), a man about town. He has
also protected Mistress Fainall (Nancy
Roberts) from any x-ascality on the
part of her husband, by taking charge
of her personal fortune.
Plot Resume
At the time the play begins, Mirabell
is in hot water because old Lady Wish
fort (Dr. Margery Bailey), the mother
of Mistress Fainall and the aunt and
guardian of Millamant to whom he had
made love in order to facilitate his
courtship of Millamant, has discovered
the imposition and is furious.
To relieve the situation he plans to
introduce a new wooer to occupy her
thoughts, "Sir Rowland, an uncle of
his," who is none other than his ser
vant, Waitwell (Robert Brauns), in
disguise. He makes sure that Waitwell
cannot overstep the bounds of his real
personality, by marrying the fellow
first to Foible (Myna Hughes), Lady
Wishfort's personal maid.
