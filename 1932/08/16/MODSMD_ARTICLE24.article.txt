# DR. MARX AND THE MARIN PROTESTS
## 
### 
The protests of certain Marin County interests against the
appointment by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of Dr.
Charles David Marx, professor of civil engineering, emeritus,
as chairman of the advisory engineering hoard which will pass
on the Golden Gate bridge project, are based on a very minor
and debatable point.
In 1!KJ0, when the bridge question was put on the ballot, Dr.
Marx, along with many other prominent engineers, actively
opposed the measure, saying, "a 'no' vote on the Golden Gate
bridge will permit an impartial investigation by the Slate."
Because of this opposition two years ago, the sponsors of
the bridge claim that Dr. Marx has disqualified himself to pass
on any feature of it, and that his previous stand will prejudice
jiim against making favorable reports to the R.F.C.
Such attacks are beside the main issue. Dr. Marx was ap
pointed to his position because of his international reputation
as an able engineer, and his opinions in this matter will be given
in llnil light. To accuse the Stanford savant of possible preju
dice is to cast aspersions on a man whose ability and open
inindedness are above reproach.
