# DEPRESSION VIRUS
## 
### 
Following the world war a strange malady swept over
America. Physicians grimly shook their heads and muttered,
"Influenza." Today, on the heels of our economic unrest, a
germ jusl as deadly is creeping into men's minds, poisoning
their outlook on life. It is the depression virus. The victim
becomes listless, blase, indifferent.
Essentially mental, it develops into a coma, and causes the
same "what's the use?" feeling that Captain John Noel de
scribed alter his attempted climb up the icy slopes of Mount
Everest.
"Depression is one of the subtle ways by which the moun
tain fought us," he said on returning to England. "It was vital
that we should enjoy ourselves and keep up our spirits. This
feeling of depression is one of the Mountain's defenses. She
made us sick, tired, quarrelsome, listless. We were disinclined
mentally to continue the fight.
"She exhausted our minds as well as our bodies. At great
altitudes, mental capacity becomes (lulled, memory hazy. This
leads easily to nervous physical tremors, upsetting the heart.
Over the mind falls a worse cloud of mental confusion. We
hardly knew what the matter was at the time, although we
realized it fully afterwards. Our very intelligence had been
affected. We had been suffocated as if bv some subtle, invisible,
Odorless gas. We found ourselves returning to a primitive, ele
mental state. The only things that interested us were food and
bodily comfort."
And the same feeing of depression that hovered over the
storm-swept wastes of Everest has been inoculated into the
American public. "Mental capacity becomes dulled." Individ
uals are no longer alert to the aesthetic things of life. "We
found ourselves returning to a primitive, elemental stale." They
flock to dog races. "The only things that interested us were
food and sleep and bodily comfort." Hut Captain Noel discov
ered that the vaccine that alleviated the situation was mental
alertness, the will to live, and fight, and win some goal.
