"Sonic men's behavior is like a verse, wherein every syllable
is measured," said Sir Francis Bacon. Yet, though Ihey might
be successful, they must miss the pleasant glow which suffuses
the heart on having made a new and delightful friend without
regard to his social standing, wealth, or power.
If you choose your friends in college by first setting them
before a yard-stick to determine their possible benefit to your
self, you are missing one of the chief advantages offered by the
American college system. For it is here that one is privileged
to meet all types and classes, and the virgin soil for the plowing
up of fertile friendships covers many acres.
The best fruit is harvested from the ground watered by
spontaneous, unselfish, delightful companionship iu sports and
classroom. The acquaintance ripens and one discovers he has
won a lifelong friendship, stronger Hum anv that is bound only
by Ihe tics of obligation.
