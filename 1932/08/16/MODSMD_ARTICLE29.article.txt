### 
THE FIRST YEAR—At the Stanford
Theatre.
Frank Craven's stage success of the
same name has been transformed into
a talkie, and not without satisfactory
results. The Gaynor-Farrell combina
tion scores another hit—this time a
comedy of domestic life sprinkled with
spicy romance.

Mme. Ernestine Schumann-
Heink, beloved singer, will ap
pear in person at the Stanford
Theatre on August 25. She will
sing three or four numbers at the
matinee and two evening per
formances.
Harry Browne, theatre man
ager, completed the arrangements
for this special feature.

Miss Gaynor, thanks to competent
direction or possibly regeneration on
her part, instills a certain amount of
dramatic action into the mediocre part
of a simple but ambitious country
lass. As for her partner, Charles Far
rell, his characterization of the build
ing real estate promoter left nothing
to be desired. In a particular drinking
scene he approaches close to being a
second David Manners or Clive Brooks.
Despite a rather creaky plot dealing
with optional contracts, an unscrupu
lous blond railroad agent, domestic
discord, and unexpected good fortune
together with a rollicking parlor fight
between the husband and villain, the
story moves swiftly, and little time is
devoted to irksome love scenes.
Bill Miller's record-breaking pole
vault is revealed in the Fox News. An
idiotic comedy and cartoon mar an
otherwise good program. •—J.R.B.
