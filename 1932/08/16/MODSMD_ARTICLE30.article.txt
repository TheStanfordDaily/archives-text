# CALIFORNIA ONCE A HAPPY HUNTING LAND SAYS MUSEUM HEAD
## 
### 
California might well be the happy
hunting ground to which the American
Indian looked forward; for a greater
number of different species and sub
species of mammals have been re
corded in this state since the white
man came, than have yet been listed in
any other state in the Union.
This fact is pointed out in a statistical
summary just completed by Professor
Joseph Grinnell, director of the mu
seum of vertebrate zoology of the Uni
versity of California. Counting Indians,
Caucasians, Mongolians, and Negroes
as four subspecies of the primate order
of mammals, there are 453 different
kinds of animals now living or recent
ly extinct in California, he says.
Professor Grinnell is also working
on a statistical summary of birds which
indicates that no state, except Texas,
can compete with California in the
number of species and subspecies of
birds found within its borders.
The number of species and sub
species of the various mammals in ad
dition to man, are: Opossum, 1; moles,
10; shrew-moles, 2; shrews, 22; bats,
35; bears, 9; coons, 3; ringtail-cats, 3;
martens, 2; fisher, 1; weasel, 6; mink,
2; wolverine, 1; river otters, 2; sea

California might well be the happy
hunting ground to which the American
Indian looked forward; for a greater
number of different species and sub
species of mammals have been re
corded in this state since the white
man came, than have yet been listed in
any other state in the Union.
This fact is pointed out in a statistical
summary just completed by Professor
Joseph Grinnell, director of the mu
seum of vertebrate zoology of the Uni
versity of California. Counting Indians,
Caucasians, Mongolians, and Negroes
as four subspecies of the primate order
of mammals, there are 453 different
kinds of animals now living or recent
ly extinct in California, he says.
Professor Grinnell is also working
on a statistical summary of birds which
indicates that no state, except Texas,
can compete with California in the
number of species and subspecies of
birds found within its borders.
The number of species and sub
species of the various mammals in ad
dition to man, are: Opossum, 1; moles,
10; shrew-moles, 2; shrews, 22; bats,
35; bears, 9; coons, 3; ringtail-cats, 3;
martens, 2; fisher, 1; weasel, 6; mink,
2; wolverine, 1; river otters, 2; sea
