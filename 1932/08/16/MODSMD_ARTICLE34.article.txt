Through the Library doors and up (
the stairs without a notion as to how j
to find that book on Russian railroads. I
You've forgotten the author, the ti- ]
tie, and even the It simply j
wouldn't do to let Professor X i
know of your lapse of memory, and |
the information is essential.
If you could go in the |
you can't. If the boy at the desk would |
help you out, but he's busy and wants j
the call number. In despair you look |
up railroads, but the cards under them 1
are profuse and would take hours to j
look through, with the ultimate possi- j
bility of not recognizing the book even |
then.

Perhaps under Russia .... and
there it is: Russian Railroads. No won
der you'd forgotten that man's name j
. . . . impossible to spell; and the j
title says nothing of railroads . . . . j
you never would have recognized it I
without the list of subjects at the bot- j
torn of*each card which gives the gen
eral contents of every book.
How much time and energy would '
have been saved had you known what j
to look under in the beginning . . . . I
but you didn't. Maybe next time
Realizing that many students are not
aware of the methods of classifying
books in the Stanford Libraries, the
Catalog Division, under the direction
of Miss Florence M. Craig, has ar- J
ranged an exhibit in the main floor i
cases as an aid in the intelligent use j
of the card files. I
Cards for Every Magazine
One case shows the rules compiled j
by the American and British Library
Associations, and sample cards from j
the Library of Congress and other uni
versities that are of assistance in ar
ranging the cards.
If you want an issue of a periodical
that has changed its name long since,
you find that every magazine has a set
of cards giving the subjects included, '
the editors, the organizations respon- I
sible for its publication, and all the
previous titles it has had.
Perhaps the book you want is .
printed in Hebraic or German type. ;
The card is also. One of the problems !
that confronts the cataloger is the ne- ;
cessity for special typewriters for a
large variety of publications.
Elusive Call Number Explained
The exhibit also gives sample sets |
of cards illustrating the cataloging of j
a single article included in a larger i
work, anonymous classics, society pub
lications, and books in the valuable
collection. If you want to know how
to look up any of them in the future,
now is your chance to find out how
to do it in the simplest manner.
As the Hoover War Library uses the
Library of Congress classification j
scheme, and the main Library the Mel
ville Dewy decimal classification, the
cards may easily be differentiated, and
you will know exactly where to go for
the volume.
The student who sees this exhibil {
and gets specific information it affords i
as to what that elusive call-number
stands for, need never again waste the
time looking for a book, or go to a lec
ture without having done the assigned j
reading because he couldn't find a cer
tain article.

the volume.
The student who sees this exhibil {
and gets specific information it affords i
as to what that elusive call-number
stands for, need never again waste the
time looking for a book, or go to a lec
ture without having done the assigned j
reading because he couldn't find a cer
tain article.
Through the Library doors and up (
the stairs without a notion as to how j
to find that book on Russian railroads. I
You've forgotten the author, the ti- ]
tie, and even the It simply j
wouldn't do to let Professor X i
know of your lapse of memory, and |
the information is essential.
If you could go in the |
you can't. If the boy at the desk would |
help you out, but he's busy and wants j
the call number. In despair you look |
up railroads, but the cards under them 1
are profuse and would take hours to j
look through, with the ultimate possi- j
bility of not recognizing the book even |
then.
Use of Card Files Explained
Perhaps under Russia .... and
there it is: Russian Railroads. No won
der you'd forgotten that man's name j
. . . . impossible to spell; and the j
title says nothing of railroads . . . . j
you never would have recognized it I
without the list of subjects at the bot- j
torn of*each card which gives the gen
eral contents of every book.
How much time and energy would '
have been saved had you known what j
to look under in the beginning . . . . I
but you didn't. Maybe next time
Realizing that many students are not
aware of the methods of classifying
books in the Stanford Libraries, the
Catalog Division, under the direction
of Miss Florence M. Craig, has ar- J
ranged an exhibit in the main floor i
cases as an aid in the intelligent use j
of the card files. I
Cards for Every Magazine
One case shows the rules compiled j
by the American and British Library
Associations, and sample cards from j
the Library of Congress and other uni
versities that are of assistance in ar
ranging the cards.
If you want an issue of a periodical
that has changed its name long since,
you find that every magazine has a set
of cards giving the subjects included, '
the editors, the organizations respon- I
sible for its publication, and all the
previous titles it has had.
Perhaps the book you want is .
printed in Hebraic or German type. ;
The card is also. One of the problems !
that confronts the cataloger is the ne- ;
cessity for special typewriters for a
large variety of publications.
Elusive Call Number Explained
The exhibit also gives sample sets |
of cards illustrating the cataloging of j
a single article included in a larger i
work, anonymous classics, society pub
lications, and books in the valuable
collection. If you want to know how
to look up any of them in the future,
now is your chance to find out how
to do it in the simplest manner.
As the Hoover War Library uses the
Library of Congress classification j
scheme, and the main Library the Mel
ville Dewy decimal classification, the
cards may easily be differentiated, and
you will know exactly where to go for
the volume.
