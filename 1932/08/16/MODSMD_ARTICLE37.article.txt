The Editor, Sir:
Your article "Aye Go Hum" could
pass if it were getting at the point and
it it did not contain those chauvinist
allusions, which, after all, make it
j amiss.
I suppose you tried to comment on
j Garbo's leaving the movies, or her
1 artistic career, above all. If you mingle
I chauvinism with artistic criticism, you
; never will get far in your art, what
ever it is.
It is true, in some of her last pic
, tures, as "Grand Hotel,' Gar bo seemed
to fool the public with intention. It
(must be said, however, that in former
ones she could easily and favorably
compare with most other so-called
"stars." "At least, her play was not so
superficially silly and unrefined. And
i let us hope that in her place we shall
| not see the suggested "Buffalo Blonde."
The very name is utterly prosaic. I
j think we would rather see more of the
| kind of Ruth Chatterto:i, for instance.
Besides, there is nothing wrong
| about her going to Sweden even if
I $750,000 go along. She carried them
rather honestly, I suppose, and has the
1 perfect right to spend the rest of her
days at home. There are many good
| Americans, and among them authors
| and artists, who spend more than that
! in foreign countries every year.
Yours very truly, J. R. Beck
