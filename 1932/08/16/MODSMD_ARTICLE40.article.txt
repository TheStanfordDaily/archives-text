# SPORTS ECHOES...
## THE 						TUMULT AND THE SHOUTING DIES 
### 
Down in Los Angeles, it's all over, j
For two weeks the southern play
ground has held the attention of
sportsmen (he world over. The city of
beatific business men put on a great
show. No doubt they were the most
perfect hosts which could have been
found in any city of the country, i
There's nothing quite so lavish as Los I
Angeles extending itself.
And the Olympics themselves â€”
they were the best in history. The
greatest United Stutes victory of
all. we thfink, was saved for the
last, when eight stalwarts from
Berkeley swept over the rowing
course at Long Beacli to defeat
Italy by two feet for the interna
tional crew title.
But now the show is over, and the j
Olympic Stadium, which used to be |
the Coliseum, will lie quiet until foot- J
ball season starts and Howard Jones j
turns out another Thundering Herd at i
S.C. And don't fool yourselves, you j
grid fans, this year's Trojans will be a
Thundering Herd. It will be good busi- j
ness for the stadium officials to settle
their differences with Troy and keep
what very likely will be the West's j
football classics out of the Pasadena j
Rose Bowl.
