# TO MENTION SOMETHING THAT HAS GRIPED A LONG TIME
## 
### 
Earlier this summer the bible of col
legiana, College Humor magazine, came
out with an Ail-American baseball
team. Although the Pacific Coast fan
has no way of knowing just what the
magazine put over in the way of Holy
Cross right-fielders, he would still be
justified in questioning the entire Ail-
American selection because of a par
ticularly glaring oversight in naming
the star bat-wielder of the West.
That oversight was the omission
of the name of Vince Phillippi,
flashy Stanford second-baseman
and the league's leading batter
last spring. The omission wouldn't
have been so bad except for the
that Orv Mohler, Trojan foot
ball hero who cavorted around
second base on collegiate diamonds,
was included as the West's best
infielder.
There's something amiss in College
Humor's reckoning when it is con
sidered that Mohler, playing on a
stronger team, was able to equal
neither the batting nor fielding record
of the Indian slugger.
