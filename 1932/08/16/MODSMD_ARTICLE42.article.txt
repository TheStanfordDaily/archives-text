Deserting the diamond for the foot- j
ball field again, the Stanford Indian j
must not be ignored in figuring the j
probabilities of Pacific Coast Confer- j
ence results this fall. Many a fan ex
pressed the opinion last year, just after j
the Big Game, that that contest had
marked the end of the era of Stanford
supremacy over California and general
prowess in the West.
On the contrary, Pop Warner's
1932 squad looks to be the best
eleven representing the Farm since
1929, when Chuck Smalling and
Herb Fleishhacker were pounding
over little Walt Heinecke for con
sistent gains. Barring the misfor
tune of an injury epidemic like
that of last season, we're picking
the Indians right now to defeat the |
Bears in the Big Game.

Kite or Scribner, guards; Gribben and ]

back that line-up with something more ,
