# DICTATORSHIP FOR SPAIN NOT LIKELY ESPINOSA STATES
## Present Coalition Of Socialist And Republican Groups Prevents Change 
### 
"Those who fear that a dictatorship
is imminent in Spain, as a result of the
recent Monarchist counter revolt, have
lost sight of the trend of Spanish po
litical thought in the last few years,"
says Dr. Aurelio M. Espinosa, Jr., act
ing assistant professor of Spanish at
Stanford. Dr. Espinosa was a student
in Madrid in 1929-30, and has been as
sociate professor of historical research
in the University of Madrid and in the
ministry of public instruction since
that time.
Explaining that a dictatorship would
not be tolerated by the Republican and
Socialist groups, Dr. Espinosa said: "It
is considered as a possible solution only
by the parties of the extreme Right.'
Minister Supreme
"The Spanish form of government
differs from ours in that the minister
iii jiower has supreme authority and
is, in this sense, a dictator. As long as
he maintains a majority in parliament,
his is a virtual dictatorship. However,
when such a majority is lost, a cabinet
representing the new majority takes
over the reigns of government and is
in complete control as long as the ma
jority exists."
In Dr. Espinosa's opinion there is no
reason to think that any change can be
brought about by the rebellion of a
small minority, since the present coali
tion of Socialist and Republican groups
is strongly supported in Parliament.
Monarchists Weak
Dr. Espinosa remarked that if the
monarchist Sanjurjo had been .success
ful, there would probably have been a
military dictatorship by the parties of
the Right. "The defeat of the Sanjurjo
clearly signifies the strength of the
present government as against any
monarchist form of government, he
declared.
Dr. Espinosa believes that the prin
cipal result of this incident will be the
removal of any positive danger to the
present regime. He noted that the
Monarchists, in preferring arms to a
fight at the polls, have shown them
selves to have little political weight and
have practically eliminated themselves
from the field of activity.
Change Not Likely
"The Monarchists have even jeopard
ized the position of the conservative
Republicans," Dr. Espinosa said. "Mel
quiades, Alvarez, and Lerroux, who
constituted the Right Wing and who
openly admitted that they would wel
come a form of Monarchy will now be
looked upon with suspicion. The Cen
ter and Left groups of the Repub
licans, led by Azana and Albornoz, and
the Socialist party must now be con
sidered as the foremost defenders of
democratic principles in Spain.
"These two groups were the principal
ones who helped to overthrow the
Monarchy, and they have been in the
majority since the first days of the
Republic. These groups are firmly in
power at the present time and it is in
conceivable how the recent Royalist
defeat can bring about a dictatorship."

reason to think that any change can be
brought about by the rebellion of a
small minority, since the present coali
tion of Socialist and Republican groups
is strongly supported in Parliament.
Monarchists Weak
Dr. Espinosa remarked that if the
monarchist Sanjurjo had been .success
ful, there would probably have been a
military dictatorship by the parties of
the Right. "The defeat of the Sanjurjo
clearly signifies the strength of the
present government as against any
monarchist form of government, he
declared.
Dr. Espinosa believes that the prin
cipal result of this incident will be the
removal of any positive danger to the
present regime. He noted that the
Monarchists, in preferring arms to a
fight at the polls, have shown them
selves to have little political weight and
have practically eliminated themselves
from the field of activity.
Change Not Likely
"The Monarchists have even jeopard
ized the position of the conservative
Republicans," Dr. Espinosa said. "Mel
quiades, Alvarez, and Lerroux, who
constituted the Right Wing and who
openly admitted that they would wel
come a form of Monarchy will now be
looked upon with suspicion. The Cen
ter and Left groups of the Repub
licans, led by Azana and Albornoz, and
the Socialist party must now be con
sidered as the foremost defenders of
democratic principles in Spain.
"These two groups were the principal
ones who helped to overthrow the
Monarchy, and they have been in the
majority since the first days of the
Republic. These groups are firmly in
power at the present time and it is in
conceivable how the recent Royalist
defeat can bring about a dictatorship."
"Those who fear that a dictatorship
is imminent in Spain, as a result of the
recent Monarchist counter revolt, have
lost sight of the trend of Spanish po
litical thought in the last few years,"
says Dr. Aurelio M. Espinosa, Jr., act
ing assistant professor of Spanish at
Stanford. Dr. Espinosa was a student
in Madrid in 1929-30, and has been as
sociate professor of historical research
in the University of Madrid and in the
ministry of public instruction since
that time.
Explaining that a dictatorship would
not be tolerated by the Republican and
Socialist groups, Dr. Espinosa said: "It
is considered as a possible solution only
by the parties of the extreme Right.'
Minister Supreme
"The Spanish form of government
differs from ours in that the minister
iii jiower has supreme authority and
is, in this sense, a dictator. As long as
he maintains a majority in parliament,
his is a virtual dictatorship. However,
when such a majority is lost, a cabinet
representing the new majority takes
over the reigns of government and is
in complete control as long as the ma
jority exists."
In Dr. Espinosa's opinion there is no
reason to think that any change can be
brought about by the rebellion of a
