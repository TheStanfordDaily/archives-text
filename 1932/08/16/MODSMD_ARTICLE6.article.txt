## Rise In Commodity Prices Is Favorable Sign 
### 
"Business in the United States may
possibly be entering upon the first
part of the long road leading back to
prosperity," said Dr. Bernard Haley,
head of the economics department, in
an interview yesterday. Professor Haley
based this opinion upon a number of
optimistic occurrences in the immediate
past.

''There has been a slight rise in com
modity prices," said Haley. "Evidences
of renewed confidence in banks, and
in the bond market, together with some
increases in a few lines of business in
which decreases ordinarily occur at
this time of the year, are all to be
regarded as favorable factors possibly
forecasting the return of business pros
perity."
However, Dr. Haley also noted:
"Most indices of* productive activity
have continued to decline; consequent
ly there is no valid basis for predicting
an immediate or rapid return of busi
ness prosperity."
