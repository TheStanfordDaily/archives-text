# Uncle Sam Makes War on Beetles
## 
### 


L'licle Sam has declared warâ€”but the object of his wrath is a pernicious
insect invader who will this year attempt to destroy as much of the nation's
food, flowers and shrubbery as possible, just as he has done 111 past seasons.
The pest, known as the Japanese beetle, is being battled by means of traps,
which might be called "execution chambers." At the loft are shown some
of the GOO death chambers in which LiUO different kinds of poison are used to
determine which is the most fatal to the beetle, at the experimental station at
Moorestown, N. J. Miss Gertrude I'resscott, at right, is shown examining one
of the traps.
