# OHIO FARMERS SEE STANFORD CAMPUS ON WESTERN TOUR
## Group of 153 Ohioans Visits Memorial Church, Has Lunch In Union 
### 
On an 8,000-mile train and bus tour
of the Midwest and West, 153 men and
women comprising the roster of the
sixth annual Ohio Farmers' Western
Tour visited campus points of interest
Sunday.
These yearly sixteen-day trips are
sponsored by "The Ohio Farmer," a
farm journal published by Senator
Capper of Kansas. Traveling by spe
cial train, the party is making stop
over visits in representative western
cities. The group arrived in Palo Alto
Sunday morning, coming by way of
Phoenix and Los Angeles.
From here they went to Sacramento
on a new lap which will take them to
Vancouver, 8.C., across Glacier Na
tional Park, back to St. Paul, and then
home. The contingent started at Cleve
land August 6.
In speaking of economic conditions
the farmers said that the depression
is being felt very keenly in Ohio. Low
prices and a weak market are com
bining to make farming in Ohio un
profitable at the present time.
One individual in the group was
celebrating his eighty-fourth birthday.
