peach. The "saucer peach" is being I
used by W. F. Wight, lecturer in bot- I
any and head of the Experimental [
Orchard, in producing hybrids which j
will be used commercially.
The desirable characteristics of thi.s 1
peach, a very sweet flavor and an j
adaptability to regions of a high mean j
winter temperature, make it valuable j
in grafting work. Favorable recogni- j
tion of one type of hybrid produced j
from the "saucer peach"' has already j
been accorded Wight by a Los Angeles j
firm.
