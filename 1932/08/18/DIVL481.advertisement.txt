In these times of serious economic re
*
lations advertising is needed more than
ever before to regulate the buying habits
of individuals. Purchasers are more cau
tious in their choice of goods. They are
quicker to select better values because
they buy with greater attention to the
relation of quality to price. Advertising
is the one medium that can present effi
ciently and accurately true values in a
market.
The advertisements in the "Stanford
Daily" are placed there by firms which
have quality goods to offer you. They
have put themselves on record in the
pages of this newspaper. They know
that their goods will stand inspection—
that they will live up to the claims made
for them. They invite your comparison.
Any firm which seeks your patronage
through the printed page knows that
what he sells must give satisfaction—
for even advertising cannot sell an un
worthy product twice. Depend upon
advertised products and you will obtain
quality.
