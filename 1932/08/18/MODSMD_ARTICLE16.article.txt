# HINTON SPEAKS ON MANCHURIA
## Japan Forced To Fight For World Prestige 
### 
Speaking at the Assembly Hall Tues
day evening, W. J. Hinton named the
Port Arthur lease, by the terms of
which China should have gained Port
Arthur in 1923 and subsequently the
South Manchurian railroad, as the 100C
of the present trouble between China
and Japan. Hinton, who is director of
studies, Institute of Banker's, London,
spoke on "The Situation in Manchuria
and Shanghai. It's Significance in World
Affairs."
The speaker briefly outlined the his
tory of the relations in the Far East
during the last 50 years, emphasizing
the causes of the successive disturb
ances.
As a result of the Russo-Japanese
War, Japan gained the Manchurian
railway and a position of leadership in
the Far East. She invested a great part
of her capital in this railroad* Hinton
considers Japan's failure to become
China's guide at this time, rather than
her enemy, a major tragedy.
War Eliminated Russia
The period of the Great War elimi
nated Russia, and saw the colonizing
of Manchuria by the Chinese. Man
churia became a Chinese state built
around a Japanese core, namely, the
railroad. Also, at this time (1915) the
Chinese, wrecked by revolutions, were
forced to renew the Port Arthur and
railroad leases beyond the year 2000.
After the war, Japan's party, acting
upon foreign advice, tried to institute
a policy of conciliation with China.
This policy, given a fair chance in the
opinion of Hinton, was a failure, due
to the antagonism created by the Port
Arthur lease. This lease Japan cannot
give up without losing an enormous
investment.
The crisis created by economic pres
sure and the failure of the conciliation
policy put the military party in power.
Their policy of insuring returns on the
Chinese investment resulted in the last
war.
Shanghai Incident an Accident
The Shanghai incident, Hinton be
lieves, was an accident. "The Japanese
were forced to fight until they took
the town to uphold their prestige in
the world,"' he said. "Japan has all her
eggs in one basket (Manchuria) and
nothing but a satisfactory return of
the eggs will induce her, or would in
duce any nation, to give them up."
Hinton sees Japan's position as typi
cal of the position of all great states
under a "closed system." These states
must gain territory abounding in raw
materials; by war, if necessary, or by
a policy of equalization through free
intercourse among all nations. Hinton
sees no sign of an adoption of the latter
policy.
