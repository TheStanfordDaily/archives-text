# DR. MARGERY BAILEY WINS APPLAUSE FOR CHARACTER READING
## 
### 
Dr. Margery Bailey led the Sword
and Sandals and English Club troupe
to success in their last reading of the
summer season, "The Way of the
World." A well-filled house received
William Congreve's comedy last night.
Witty repartee, speed, and a high
level of humor characterized the hodge
podge plot which concerned trivialities
of conventions and the making or
breaking of reputations.
A convenient cast . supported Dr.
Bailey who read flawlessly and kept
the house waiting for her speeches.
More restraint and contrast in the
voices of the rest of the leading parts
would have kept the entire play up
to the standard Dr. Bailey set.
Waldo Salt and Will Williams offered
relief by their pitch of voice and
change "of speed, while Charles Beards
ley provided the audience with laughs.
Other parts in the reading were those
taken by Charles Beardsley, Will Wil
liams, Marion Jones, Nancy Roberts,
Robert Brauns, Myna Hughes, Virginia
Radcliffe, James Sandoe, Waldo Salt,
Matthew Evans, and Aurabelle Carter.
