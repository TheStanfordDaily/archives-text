The annual summer swimming carnival being held this
afternoon in the Kncina pools represents the one outstanding
athletic spectacle of the quarter. With a full program of events
as arranged by Norton Thornton, swiming coach, the meet
should interest not only followers of aquatic sports, but anybody
who enjoys good entertainment.

One outstanding feature of the meet will be a water polo
battle between teams composed of former varsity mermen,
many of whom enjoy national face in the sport.
Color and speed of action typify this game. Damon Runyon,
noted sports writer, in reviewing the Olympic Games recently,
commented: "The crowd at the Olympics has learned that water
polo is one of the most interesting games ever devised. It con
tains the roughness and excitement that the American sports
fan loves so well." He adds on another date: "The day at the
swiming pool concludes with another of those water polo games
that have taken violent hold on the spectators out here." Such
a game finds an appropriate place upon this afternoon's car
nival program.
By their heavy enrollment in swimming classes Stanford
women of the summer colony have proven that the sport appeals
to them. Today's meet will afford a rare opportunity for the
women to witness many interesting events in this popular sport
in the new Encina pools.
