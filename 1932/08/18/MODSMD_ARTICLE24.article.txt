The "hour of parting" draws near for students in the School
of Education. They leave us Saturday, and the Daily takes this
(•portunity to say goodbye.

Together we have bull-scssioned, consumed cokes at the
I'liion, and sun-bathed, and have once again realized, more
emphatically perhaps, that after all those connected with the
leaching profession are essentially human.
And now we can only grasp your hands collectively and
say, "Anf Weidersehen. It's been nice knowing you."
