# THESE CAMPUS "COCKLEBURS"

. a cocklebur which servos as a pin to a thinking
majority" that is how Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur described Stan
lord's eruption of political radicalism in the founding of a
Thomas-for-President club on the campus. Such student radi
cals are a natural occurrence in a university group, regardless
of the year and the times, stated Stanford's A.W.L. president,
adding, "Most of them outgrow this stage, but some of them
never do."
It is not surprising that Dr. Wilbur failed to display much
interest or concern over the political radicalism of his school's
students, for Dr. Wilbur is an educator of long standing, and
he knows his college man. He knows, for example, that college
men are not overly serious nor overly sincere in their theoretical
radicalism. And he knows that, in a broad sense, college men
represent fundamentally the capitalistic stratum of society.
Knowing those things, Dr. Wilbur would have been justified in
criticizing the local Thomas-for-President movement as wasted
energy, although such a criticism would perhaps have incurred
an unfavorable reaction.

Nevertheless, the Daily feels that it can safely make that >
criticism, and on good grounds. College students are the most !
enthusiastic theorists which can be found anywhere. As such i
they may have glowing images of a socialistic society, but, con- j
sidcring their background, it is inconceivable that they would
ever become so devoted to the theory of socialism that they j
would go to the polls in a body and vote against the capitalism
from which they spring. For that reason, campaigning on a I
college campus for the election of Norman Thomas can be very I
little more than a futile gesture, a fact which the Thomas-for-
President clubmen must recognize. Therefore, their activity |
may quite likely represent an attempt to gain political practice, j
rather than an intensely serious desire to secure the election of
their standard-bearer.
The Daily's question of the sincerity of the movement finds i
ils basis, unfortunately, in personalities. A member of the 1
Thomas-for-President club's executive board remarked the
other day that he had been drawn into the movement because
il offered a bit of practical experience in politics, hut that he
assuredly was not going to cast his ballot for Norman Thomas.
And so wo dub the activities of Stanford's "cockloburs" mere
wasted energy.
