I COVER TIIK WATERFRONT — By
Mux Miller. Dutton &. Co. 1 ( J:!2. $2.0(1.
At the Stanford Bookstore.
Max Miller is a special reporter on
the San Diego Sun, and his beat is the
waterfront. Here, for many years, off
and on, he has gone out to meet boats,
interview celebrities, swap yarns with
old sea dogs, and make cruises on any
and all occasions. Reporting this field
is not a humdrum job to him; it is the
very joy of his life.
Out of the vast array of notes which
he has collected over this time, Miller
has written the most interesting of
them into this book, "1 Cover the
Waterfront." There are tales of deep
sea adventure, character sketches of
typical seamen, personal revelations
along irrelevant topics, and bits of
philosophy which pop up now and then
in connection with some unusual ex
perience.
"I Cover the Waterfront" is not a
book of reportorial adventures. It is
simply a series of pictures drawn from
the author's contacts with the pictur
esque San Diego harbor life. It is writ
ten entertainingly, realistically, and
with good touches of rich humor.
The proof of its attraction for the
average reader is that the fifth printing
is almost sold out, and the book is
breaking into the best-seller class. It
is worthy of such a distinction, too.
—N.V.S.

SKYSCRAPER SOULS—At (lie Stan
ford Theatre.
This should complete the cycle
launched so successfully by Vicki
Baum, of themes where the action
takes place in one concentrated area.
We have had murder, comedy, and
pathos in a "Union Depot." Then came
more murder, comedy, and pathos in a
ship, "Transatlantic." And now we
have additional murder, comedy, and
pathos in a skyscraper.
Warren William is the crisp, debon
nair financial tycoon who philanders
with secretaries and stocks. Maureen
O'Sullivan is a secretary's stenogra
pher who doesn't mind taking dicta
tion from William. And in a 102-story
"tower of Babel" people come and go,
and there's something popping every
minute. —E.L.
