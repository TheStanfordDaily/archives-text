# SPORTS ECHOES...
## THE 						PARADE GOES ON, TO BERKELEY 
### 
The bull has started to roll again,
over "in Berkeley, with Coach Bill In
gram gathering his freshman gridiron
prospects around him and letting them
tell him what positions they'd like to
play on the Blue and Gold yearling
eleven. Ten to one the majority of
Freshman Coach Clint Evans' back
lield applicants wind up the season
playing at tackle. But that's beside the
pointâ€”the California coaches have as
sembled a good-looking bunch of frosh.
We couldn't help noticing (now,
could we?) that the name of Frank
Walker was included in the lists
published of California's new crop
of pigskin chasers. The star Poly
High fullback, an all-city selec
tion last season, was slated to en
roll at Stanford this fall at one
time, but now he turns up for
opening practice in Berkeley.
Why Walker changed his choice ot
school, we wonder. Perhaps football
isn't so all-important in his life after
all, and he is going to college for an
education. Meanwhile, we note that
Coach Bill Ingram, of the well-known
ability at speech-making, has enrolled
for a couple of courses in the Cali
fornia law school. Maybe, while Navy
Bill is brushing up on torts and con
tracts, it wouldn't be such a bad idea
for Pop Warner to register in the pub
lic speaking division. There's a lot of
football played before September.
