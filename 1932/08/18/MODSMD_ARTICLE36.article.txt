# DOC KEARNS TALKS ANOTHER FIGHT
## 
### 
Jack Kearns, erstwhile manager of
the world's champion Dcmpsey, who
now does the verbal battling for
Mickey Walker, the Rumson Bulldog,
struck the first blow the other day in
the Walker-Schmeling melee, which is
scheduled for September 19 in Madi
son Square Garden. The old doctor
used harsh words, calling the German
ex-champ a quitter and "no fighter"—
words which he will probably swallow
on the night when the Milk Fund gets
swelled. Not that we're picking any
body to win that fight, for both battlers
have a newspaper victory over world's
champion Jack Sharkey to their credit,
although the best Walker could get
from the judges was a draw, while the
German boy lost the decision in his
encounter with the Boston gob.
