# FOUR CARDS WILL PLAY IN TOURNEY
## Seaver, Eichelberger, Little, And Hawley Qualify For Amateur Golf Play 
### 
Four Stanford golfers — Charles
Seaver, Harry Eichelberger, Stuart
Hawley, Jr., and Lawson Little — will
compete in the National Amateur
tournament at Baltimore next month.
Hawley was one of three men to
qualify for the national tourney from
the Northern California district. After
shooting two under pav for a 70 over
the California Golf Club course on
Monday, he slumped to a 77 Tuesday,
but his total of 147 placed him just
behind H. Chandler Egan, who had
146. Francis Ii Brown. Honolulu tee
artist, was first with 145.
Eichelberger Has Low Round
Both Seaver and Eichelberger quali
fied from the Southern California re
gion. The former Card captain led four
men with a total of 112, while Seaver
took second with 147. <
Eichelberger scored a 67 on his first
18 holes, leading all national qualifiers
for the first round. He also tied with
Logan Van Zandt of Denver for second
low over the 36-hole route, totaling 142.
Ross Somerville of London, Ontario,
shot 140 at Cleveland.
Little Wins Place at Denver
Lawson Little won his right to com
pete in the national match play by
taking fourth place in the tests at Den
ver, with a pair of 75's for a total of
150.

Seaver is one of the favorites to win
the amateur crown this year, although
a galaxy of golfing stars will be dis
puting his claim. Many experts, such
as Bobby Jones, Grantland Rice, and
Robert Edgren, pick the Stanford
sophomore as Jones' successor in the
links world.
