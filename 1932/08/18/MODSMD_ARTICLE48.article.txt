Al Masters grabbed the day's mail
; off his mahogany desk. There was a
package from Yellowstone Park. It was
| not a post card marked "Wish you
were here."
"Well, well, it must be another check
for $11.20," he remarked as he reached
I for a post card to send in reply in
i forming recipient that his serial is
7025, "refer to this number in all fu
| ture communications."
Masters started to unwrap the
bundle.
"Maybe he's paying us off in Ger
man marks or Russian rubles," he
I muttered.
! His knife slit the last wrapping. An
! object fell out. It looked like a Palo
! Alto cop's night stick, or a busted
| tennis racquet handle, or something
| equally innocuous. But it looked like
I a stick of dynamite, too. In fact, the
I more Masters looked at it the more
he was convinced that someone had
; shipped him an infernal machine,
j Once upon a time Al was a track
man. He showed lots of form as he ran
for a bathtub. There wasn't any. He
let a drinking fountain pinch-hit.
About that time corporation yard
j sleuths hove on the scene. Al's "dyna
mite" was given the "o.o." and experts
| pronounced it to be oiled sand,
i It was turned over to the janitorial
; corps to keep down dust while sweep
ing. Masters still has the note that ac
companied the dud bomb. It said:
j "Your prices are too high."
