A leader who grew to tremendous
, power by feeding on the frenzied de
spair of the German bourgeoisie—
A suave politician who promises all
things to all men—
Orator supreme, who sways the mul
: titude—
Such is Adolph Hitler, the man who
| is said to control 37 per cent of the
Reichstag vote in the opinion of Dr.
I H. R. Spencer, acting professor of po
litical science from Ohio State Uni
j versity.
I The visiting savant voiced his theo
| ries before an audience that packed
the Little Theatre and overflowed into
i the Quad corridors yesterday.
Hitler Growth Traced
Tracing the unparalleled growth of
; Hitler's national Socialist party which
i from 1928 to 1930 increased its strength
I eight times and by 1932 doubled this

; number to 13,000,000 supporters, Dr.
Speftcer clearly showed the forces
which made this development possible.
In speaking of Hitler's strength, Dr.
J Spencer said that it came not from the
; big cities, not from the workers in in
j dustry, not from the Catholics, but
from the middle class. This group,
driven to frenzy by starvation result
ing from the blockade over a period
of six or eight months after the sign
ing of the Armistice, the disaster of
the inflation of Geiman money, and by
! the present ecenomic crisis, blindly
i follows the man who promises to lead
j them back to happier days they still
j remember.
Compared to Mussolini
Others who rally around Hitler's red
: flag with its white circle bearing a
| swastika are the young men who seek
: to regenerate their country; the flighty
j who admire the marching Brown
'shirts; the riff-raff who hope to make
| personal gain; the new voters who
j have lit tie interest in politics and only
I turn to it now in a time of black
despair; and the young officers of the
| army who are experienced in counter
! revolution and assassination.
Contrasting Hitler with Mussolini,
i Dr. Spencer said he thought the Ger
| man leader lacked some of the sublime
j belief in his destiny which the Italian
i despot shows. This may be explained
J by the defeats Hitler suffered in 1923,
' and the presidential election of this
j year in which he was defeated.
