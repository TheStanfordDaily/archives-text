# YANKS VICTORS IN HOUSE SHOW
## Visitors Trail By 10 Points On Second Night 
### 
One of the largest crowds to date
I thrilled to the victory of the United
! States over Sweden in the Interna
tional Military Team Competition
i series, held last night at the San Mateo
County National Horse Show at the
Menlo Circus Club.
The Yankee team had .four faults
[called against them, while Sweden had
i 14. This score, when added to last
| night's result, advances the position of
! the stars and stripes well in the lead.
The finals of this event will be held
Saturday night.
