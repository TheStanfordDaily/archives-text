# DR. STAUF SEES GIANT GLACIERS ON ALASKA TRIP
## Says Mountains Of Ice, Yukon Railroad And Behm Canal Were Impressive Romanic Language Instructor Makes Round-Trip To Seattle By Plane 
### 
Taku Glacier, the Yukon railroad,
and the Behm canal are the three most
magnificent places in Alaska, accord
ing to Dr. Ida Stauf, instructor in
Romanic languages, who has just re
turned from a trip to that land.
Going by boat to the very edge of
the Taku Glacier, Dr. Stauf said that
the vibrations from the ship's whistles
made huge chunks of ice fall off and
enter the flow. In contrast to this is the
"dead" Mendenhall Glacier that re
cedes rather than progresses. The Behm
Canal, which she visited on her re
turn trip, is a narrow passage in rocks
rising sheer and jagged above the
water.
"In some places," Di\ Stauf told the
Daily reporter, "we* didn't think there
would be enough room for the boat
to turn, but it was wider than the
high echoing walls would lead one to
think. When we finally reached the
end of the passage it opened out into
a bowl-shaped lake, much like Yo
semite were it Hooded."
Prefers Aerial Travel
An ardent supporter of flying, Dr.
Stauf went by plane to Seattle from
the San Francisco Bay airdrome at
Alameda; and again on her return
trip, flew home from Seattle. Though
the weather, coming back, was thick
and foggy, the plane flew above the
clouds.
"It was like ocean failing as we
glided along in the clear sun," Dr.
Stauf said. "With the comforts of the
modern passenger plane, I'd much
rather % than travel in any other
way. A very appetizing lunch was
served on board, and the hostess kept
us well supplied with newspapers and
periodicals. After such a trip one feels
refreshed rather than tired by travel
ing."
Perhaps the most interesting thing
in Juneau, one of the greatest gold
mining towns in the world, is the can
celled check for $7,200,000 that pur
chased Alaska from Russia."
Stops at Skagway
In Skagway, Dr. Stauf's next stop
after Juneau, she met Mrs. Pullin, who
has been a resident there since before
the gold rush of '98. Until the last
few years she always rode down to
the boat to greet passengers on their
arrival.
"The gardens in Skagway are also
beautiful," said Dr. Stauff. "The flowers
all over Alaska are profuse, and are
two or three times as big as those in
most other lands.
"After going over the Yukon rail
road to Lake Bennett, where we had
a lunch of moose meat, we came back
down the passage to Sitka. It is the
oldest settlement on the Pacific Coast,
and was the Russian capital for many
years. The totem poles in the natural
park, and the many pine-covered is
lands in the sound, make it a very
beautiful spot."

"dead" Mendenhall Glacier that re
cedes rather than progresses. The Behm
Canal, which she visited on her re
turn trip, is a narrow passage in rocks
rising sheer and jagged above the
water.
"In some places," Di\ Stauf told the
Daily reporter, "we* didn't think there
would be enough room for the boat
to turn, but it was wider than the
high echoing walls would lead one to
think. When we finally reached the
end of the passage it opened out into
a bowl-shaped lake, much like Yo
semite were it Hooded."
Prefers Aerial Travel
An ardent supporter of flying, Dr.
Stauf went by plane to Seattle from
the San Francisco Bay airdrome at
Alameda; and again on her return
trip, flew home from Seattle. Though
the weather, coming back, was thick
and foggy, the plane flew above the
clouds.
"It was like ocean failing as we
glided along in the clear sun," Dr.
Stauf said. "With the comforts of the
modern passenger plane, I'd much
rather % than travel in any other
way. A very appetizing lunch was
served on board, and the hostess kept
us well supplied with newspapers and
periodicals. After such a trip one feels
refreshed rather than tired by travel
ing."
Perhaps the most interesting thing
in Juneau, one of the greatest gold
mining towns in the world, is the can
celled check for $7,200,000 that pur
chased Alaska from Russia."
Stops at Skagway
In Skagway, Dr. Stauf's next stop
after Juneau, she met Mrs. Pullin, who
has been a resident there since before
the gold rush of '98. Until the last
few years she always rode down to
the boat to greet passengers on their
arrival.
"The gardens in Skagway are also
beautiful," said Dr. Stauff. "The flowers
all over Alaska are profuse, and are
two or three times as big as those in
most other lands.
"After going over the Yukon rail
road to Lake Bennett, where we had
a lunch of moose meat, we came back
down the passage to Sitka. It is the
oldest settlement on the Pacific Coast,
and was the Russian capital for many
years. The totem poles in the natural
park, and the many pine-covered is
lands in the sound, make it a very
beautiful spot."
Taku Glacier, the Yukon railroad,
and the Behm canal are the three most
magnificent places in Alaska, accord
ing to Dr. Ida Stauf, instructor in
Romanic languages, who has just re
turned from a trip to that land.
Going by boat to the very edge of
the Taku Glacier, Dr. Stauf said that
the vibrations from the ship's whistles
made huge chunks of ice fall off and
enter the flow. In contrast to this is the
"dead" Mendenhall Glacier that re
cedes rather than progresses. The Behm
Canal, which she visited on her re
turn trip, is a narrow passage in rocks
rising sheer and jagged above the
water.
