"Calling car number three . . . call

That is what Chief of Police Howard
I A. Zink, speaking before the Palo Alto
Kiwanis Club, advocated Tuesday night
J—a police radio system that would
unite the departments of Palo Alto,
! Stanford, Menlo Park, Atherton, and
| Redwood City.
"In cases of robbery," Chief Zink
I said, "when the criminal is trying to
| make a fast getaway the system would
be especially valuable. It would make
possible an immediate concentration of
, the police cars of five communities.
"The mutuality of benefit of such a
plan is self-explanatory. Palo Alto has
| 24-hour police service, but the other
! communities do not. In exchange for
i their contributions toward the cost of
I the system the other communities
i would have the benefit of Palo Alto's
{ policing vigilance so far as it could be
| made available through radio com
| munieation."
"Calling car number three . . . call
