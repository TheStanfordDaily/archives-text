# MISS RICKER HOPES TO MAINTAIN USUAL SERVICE IN CELLAR
## 
### 
Miss Christine Ricker, director of the
University dining halls, hopes to main
tain the usual 7:30 to 10:30 o'clock ser
vice in the Cellar, closing at 8 p.m. on
Saturday and Sunday nights only.
However, Miss Ricker* says that if
the attendance at night does not jus
tify the expense involved, it may be
necessary to close the Cellar at 8
o'clock every night. There will be no
change until after August 24, in any
event.
The main dining room and Union
cafeteria will probably continue to
operate as usual until the close of the
summer quarter.
