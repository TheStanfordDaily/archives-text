# DR. LUTZ WILL DISCUSS GERMAN CRISIS TONIGHT
## Chairman Of Directors Of War Library Will Speak In Little Theatre Political, Economic, Election, Reparations Problems To Be Dealt With 
### 
The contemporary German situation
is the subject of a talk to be given by
Professor Ralph H. Lutz, chairman of
the directors of the Hoover War Li
brary at 8 o'clock this evening in the
Little Theatre.

Professor Lutz will confine himself
to four points: the economic crisis, the
political situation, the apparent settle
ment of the reparations problem, and
the indecisive national election with
its many implications. He will attempt
to "finish Professor Spencer's address
on Hitler," or at least "to supplement
a great many things that Professor
Spencer said."
Will Discuss Loans
hi discussing the economic crisis he
will include the German loans to Rus
sia, and the American private invest
ments in Germany. He will also define
the financial outlook of a country
which for two years has not been able
to balance its budget.
Professor Lutz has had some diffi
culty with his prophecies; he men
tions having to revise this speech on
the German situation twice. He spoke
before the Commonwealth Club in
May, and had to rewrite that speech
before giving it later in Portland, so
great were the developments in Ger
many. The Portland speech, in turn,
had to be revised to cover the present
situation.
Predicts Future of Control
However, Lutz predicts that control
in Germany, in the immediate future,
will be in the hands of Hindenburg,
and that there is no chance of Hitler's
seizing power. He also believes that
the present settlement of reparations
will be accepted, although private ad
vices from Paris and Berlin indicate
that the Reichstag may not ratify the
agreement.

Professor Lutz took his Ph.D. at
Heidelberg, Germany. He has been in
Europe several times during the last
decade, returning from his last trip in
1931. "The Fall of the German Em
pire," written by him, will be pub
lished in October by the Stanford Uni
versity Press.
