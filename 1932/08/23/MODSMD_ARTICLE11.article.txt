### 
A symphony in one movement, com- |
bining all the tonal structure and de-I
sign of a work three times its length,
is the modern tone-poem, Olin Dowries
stated in his lecture Monday afternoon.
"The tone poem is the final evolu
tion of the symphony, and in the mag- j
nificent works of this sort, Richard
Strauss has shown himself to be the '
perfect composer," Downes stated. "In 1
Don Juan he has expressed his own
youthful emotions and ideals. He has
let himself go, and consequently there
has resulted one of the most tremen
dous expressions ever made of sym- j
phony."
