# Communism Is America's Hope, Says Noted Writer
## 
### CHARLES BEARDSLEY 
Communism is becoming more and
more general a thing, and will one day
be the basis of our national govern
ment, claims Ella Winter, noted writer
! and Soviet student, who recently re
! turned from Russia and has completed
j a book on its moral codes.
"People have asked me why I be
lieve in Communism so often that I
feel that I've got to answer it this
I time," Miss Winter said at Carmel
! Sunday. "You see, I have nice clothes,
a home, and sufficient food, and I want
i everyone to have these things, too.
That's my only reason."
Poverty Unnecessary
There is much poverty in the United
States today that could be averted,
Miss Winter believes. People simply
, will not accept the idea of an intensive
! collective ownership. And until the
government co-operates wholly, un
employment, prohibition problems, and
j crime control will remain unsolved, the
authoress is assured.
At the present moment Miss Winter
I is putting the last touches on the
manuscript of a book dealing with the
intimate side of Russian life and mor
als under the Soviet regime.
"When a nation or even a group is

] entirely communistic, a greater free
i dom and expression is the ultimate at
i tainment," Miss Winter declared. "Of
: course, there are flaws in the philo
-1 sophy of communism just as there are
flaws in anything else. But in the long
| run I believe it would be the most ef
| fective form of government.
"Consider the country as it is today
j â€”anything but what it should be. And
then realize that those schemes which
i would seem to be the most effective in
solving the present economic difficul
ties are really fundamentally commun
! istic."
Change Inevitable
The gleams of light throughout this
, dark area of uncertain finance are due
I to sudden communistic flares of philo-
I sophy breaking through the old doc
trines, in the opinion of Miss Winter.
She is "firmly convinced, as are many
j Socialist and liberal organizations, that
America cannot go on much longer as
she has been.
| "There must come a change," Miss
j Winter averred. "Communism is prob
ably the best suited social philosophy
to dominate that change, and so I feel
I that one's work for the party cannot
j possibly be fruitless."
