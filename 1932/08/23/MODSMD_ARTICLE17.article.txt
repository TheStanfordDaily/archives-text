# CAMPUS CONSUMES 80,000,000 GALLONS OF RESERVOIR WATER
## 
### 
Campus water consumption last week
amounted to 21,000.000 gallons, the
highest mark it has reached during
any week this summer. Of this, about
3,000,000 gallons were for domestic pur
poses and 18,000,000 for irrigation.
The drinking :md domestic water is
pumped from wells of 200-foot depth
into a reservoir. Since the first of the
year 80,000,000 gallons have been used
from that reservoir.
Water for all purposes, including ir
rigation, has increased 30 per cent as
compared to last summer. The present
weekly average is 19,300,000 gallons,
while the average per week for the
summer of 1031 was 14,800,0d0 gallons.
Though the irrigation supply on hand
at both Searsville and Felt lakes is
considerably higher this year than last,
A. L. Trowbridge, assistant comptroller,
warns that people should not be waste
ful with their water. "If fall rains fail
to come until late in the season, chances
are it would be necessary to pump
water into the lakes in order that these
reservoirs could be kept up to the
minimum level," says Trowbridge.
"Last year pumping was necessary on
account of the great shortage."
There are about 248,000,000 gallons
of water in Felt and Searsville lakes.
