# LEWIS TELLS OF SOCIALISTS' RISE IN U.S., ENGLAND
## Attorney For Civil Liberties Union League Talks To Stanford Club Claims Self Defender Of Any Group Showing Tendency To Collectivism 
### 
"Any sound socialistic movement
will be formed on a proletarian basis"
is the opinion of Austin Lewis, attor
ney for the Civil Liberties Union
League in San Francisco, who spoke
before members of the Norman Thom
as-for-President Club last night.
Lewis, who came here from England
following the disturbances subsequent
to 1880, founded the socialist party in
San Francisco and at one time ran for
governor on that ticket. At that time
the United States seemed to him to be
the best field for developing the so
cialistic doctrine.
Urges Taking Stand
In tracing the development of so
cialism in England and America, the
speaker characterized the movement as
monotonous and "a fight between capi
talistic and socialistic tendencies." He
attributes the seeming failure of so
cialism in the United States to its being
classed with the revolutionary groups
which came into power in some coun
tries following the World War. This
same monotonous growth is now bring
ing socialism to the front, and Lewis
believes that it will be the means of
defeating capitalism.
"Emphasis should not be placed on
the different theories of sections of so
cialistic thinkers but the important
thing is to take a stand, a definite stand,
for the relief of this present misery—
let this country be run no longer by
and for private individuals, but for and
by the people who collectively form
the country," Lewis says.
Decries Overproduction
Quoting a French anarchist, Lewis
said, "The new system of association
is growing back—preach the doctrine
of association, regardless of the shade."
On this doctrine he takes his stand as
a defender of any group which shows
a tendency toward collectivism.
"Overproduction, which can only be
remedied for the benefit of capitalists
by a pruning of men in their factories,
will result in the unemployment of
many working men," the speaker de
clared. "This is the situation at present
in the United States. The only other
method of relieving this unemploy
ment is co-operation. This can be
gained by some form of Socialism."
