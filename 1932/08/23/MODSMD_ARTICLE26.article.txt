Gambling, it seems, has made a bid for recognition as an
extra-curricular activity among San Francisco high school stu
dents. Members of the Hoard of Education have been recipients
of season passes to the Belmont race tracks. One principal, in
particular, relates that a mysterious personage, admitted to his
ollice, tossed an envelope on his desk and walked out. The en
velope was found to contain an annual pass to the races. It is
obvious once the passes were accepted by any school otlieial,
they might eventually come into the hands of students.
.lust where students of high school age might obtain money
to bet is a side issue, yet it is probable that it would come from
one of three sources—indulgent parents, wages earned through
part-time jobs, or by illicit means. In any event, this latest and
most daring attempt of gambling promoters to trespass on
school property should be summarily dealt with.
