# WHAT ABOUT CREW?

### 
In an editorial recently, the Son Francisco Chronicle said,
in pari, "Stanford gave up boat racing because of lack of any
suitable water for practice. The University of California has
developed two successive Olympic champions dodging scows
and ferryboats on the sloppy waters of the Oakland estuary,
where, perforce, its crews must row."

The aftermath of the Golden Bear's great victory at the
I entli Olympiad is a good time to raise again the old Chaparral
war-erv "What about crew?" If Berekley, with its attendant
practice dilliculties, can turn out eights that can not only win
Iwo world's championships, hut can also consistently beat other
universities that have fine natural facilities, then it is logical to
presume that Stanford can do the same.
Searsville lake may not have been an ideal sile for practice,
but il is probably just as good as the Oakland estuary. And the
recent development of the Palo Alio yacht harbor offers the
I niversily another available course which has line possibilities.
Reports from southern California indicate I hat both t'.C.L.A.
and t .S.C. are considering adopting crew, in view of the fact
lhal the Olympic racing course at Long Beach is open for their
use. If these two schools and Stanford could combine with C.C.
to stage a California intercollegiate rowing match each year,
such a meet would soon rival football as a drawing card.
The Daily is glad to congratulate California on its glorious
triumph in the Olympics. At the same lime, it is a pleasant
dream to suppose that some day the world's champion crew
might be composed of sons of the Stanford Bed.

Color to suit the mood and the letter is being urged by a
prominent ink company, which advertises such shades as Bus
set Coral. Chinese .lade, Begal Amethyst, and Swiss Lapis. Mow
about a I iiion Coffee hue to lit the "morning-after" mood?

Headline in Chicago Dailt/ A'eu>&: "Chinese General Wants
Girls to Wear Skirls." Well, General, mavbe il isn't a bad idea.
