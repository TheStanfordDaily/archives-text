# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
For decades the Republican Party
has been symbolized by the elephant,
and the Democratic by the donkey. It
has remained for Secretary Wilbur to
characterize the Socialists as "Cockle
burs.'' We of the Thomas-for-President
Club rejoice in being symbolized by an
article so prickly that it forces people
to action. In his selection of our sym
bol Secretary Wilbur shows a true ap
preciation of the present work of the
Socialist Party.

In spite of this insight, the general
tone of Dr. Wilbur's statement was
hardly what we might have expected
from the President of our University,
even though he is a member of the
Hoover administration. Perhaps no one
took offense at the Secretary's state
ments out of a prudent regard for his
position. When, however, the Stanford
Daily ineptly enlarges on his remarks,
we are not so hesitant to speak.
Socialists need not defend their be
liefs today. The movement has spread
to all corners of the globe. As the so
lution it is being accepted by thinking
people everywhere. Nowadays he who
blindly condemns Socialism or Social
ists judges himself rather than that
which he condemns.
As Socialists we welcome and recog
nize pertinent and constructive criti
cism. We regret the prejudice, shal
lowness of thought, and ignorance
manifest in the Daily's editorial. If our
sincerity is doubled more accurate in
formation might be secured by closer
acquaintance. If our effort is believed
"wasted energy" perhaps the Daily
will take the leadership in some other
movement better calculated to bring
about a more just social order.

The Editor, Sir:
About those campus socialists.
The ancients and our "revolutionary
forefathers" all had their raps before
black magic became science. Thanks
to their struggles, universities are now
the home of liberalism and radicalism.
Free of suppression, students search
the unknown, and pursue hypotheses;
become, as you put it, enthusiastic
theorists. Picking science as the guide
rather than personal motives, students
part company with the intolerant pub
lic and become radicals. Such, at least,
is their ideal. That they have the
strength to practice convictions is their
test.
The word radicalism need not carry
the noise and smoke political funda
mentalists have attached to it. Rather
it can be a university watchword, seg
regating bias from the sciences.
Although at Stanford radicalism is
the byword of many sciences, any
thing touching wealth, becomes a
cocklebur. What is the difference?
Isn't such a subject open to study? You
spoke of not being "concerned" at the
presence of a socialist club. In the
teeth of this depression with capitalism
more or less on the spot, don't you
think there would be more concern if
the cocklebur were not present? Does
Stanford want a more conservative
name than she has? Noted for her
freedom (radicalism) in natural sci

ences, how could she explain at the
same time an entire university of
stand-pat Republicanism (the thinking
majority) and a little leftover Democ
racy—which diflers how? —Such a set
up is not natural. It has to be made
through dogmatism, cut. and dried lik»
an order of monks.
Political radicalism deserves your
criticism, not your condemnation. Ex
pose it by intellectual attack. But to
dub it "wasted effort" is to betray
the trust which every educated man I
(may we say, college man) owes to !
radicalism. Elsewhere revolutionary i
thought must weather the attack of
ignorant prejudice. Here alone is its
haven, its chance for a fair fight.
In conclusion, I hope you are suc
cessful in exposing all insincere social
ists, but to base an ediorial on what
one of them "remarked the other day"
smacks of pretty weak journalism and
prejudiced minds. Sincerely,
Jack Owen

Daily ineptly enlarges on his remarks,
we are not so hesitant to speak.
Socialists need not defend their be
liefs today. The movement has spread
to all corners of the globe. As the so
lution it is being accepted by thinking
people everywhere. Nowadays he who
blindly condemns Socialism or Social
ists judges himself rather than that
which he condemns.
As Socialists we welcome and recog
nize pertinent and constructive criti
cism. We regret the prejudice, shal
lowness of thought, and ignorance
manifest in the Daily's editorial. If our
sincerity is doubled more accurate in
formation might be secured by closer
acquaintance. If our effort is believed
"wasted energy" perhaps the Daily
will take the leadership in some other
movement better calculated to bring
about a more just social order.

The Editor, Sir:
About those campus socialists.
The ancients and our "revolutionary
forefathers" all had their raps before
black magic became science. Thanks
to their struggles, universities are now
the home of liberalism and radicalism.
Free of suppression, students search
the unknown, and pursue hypotheses;
become, as you put it, enthusiastic
theorists. Picking science as the guide
rather than personal motives, students
part company with the intolerant pub
lic and become radicals. Such, at least,
is their ideal. That they have the
strength to practice convictions is their
test.
The word radicalism need not carry
the noise and smoke political funda
mentalists have attached to it. Rather
it can be a university watchword, seg
regating bias from the sciences.
Although at Stanford radicalism is
the byword of many sciences, any
thing touching wealth, becomes a
cocklebur. What is the difference?
Isn't such a subject open to study? You
spoke of not being "concerned" at the
presence of a socialist club. In the
teeth of this depression with capitalism
more or less on the spot, don't you
think there would be more concern if
the cocklebur were not present? Does
Stanford want a more conservative
name than she has? Noted for her
freedom (radicalism) in natural sci

ences, how could she explain at the
same time an entire university of
stand-pat Republicanism (the thinking
majority) and a little leftover Democ
racy—which diflers how? —Such a set
up is not natural. It has to be made
through dogmatism, cut. and dried lik»
an order of monks.
Political radicalism deserves your
criticism, not your condemnation. Ex
pose it by intellectual attack. But to
dub it "wasted effort" is to betray
the trust which every educated man I
(may we say, college man) owes to !
radicalism. Elsewhere revolutionary i
thought must weather the attack of
ignorant prejudice. Here alone is its
haven, its chance for a fair fight.
In conclusion, I hope you are suc
cessful in exposing all insincere social
ists, but to base an ediorial on what
one of them "remarked the other day"
smacks of pretty weak journalism and
prejudiced minds. Sincerely,
Jack Owen
The Editor, Sir:
For decades the Republican Party
has been symbolized by the elephant,
and the Democratic by the donkey. It
has remained for Secretary Wilbur to
characterize the Socialists as "Cockle
burs.'' We of the Thomas-for-President
Club rejoice in being symbolized by an
article so prickly that it forces people
to action. In his selection of our sym
bol Secretary Wilbur shows a true ap
preciation of the present work of the
Socialist Party.

In spite of this insight, the general
tone of Dr. Wilbur's statement was
hardly what we might have expected
from the President of our University,
even though he is a member of the
Hoover administration. Perhaps no one
took offense at the Secretary's state
ments out of a prudent regard for his
position. When, however, the Stanford
Daily ineptly enlarges on his remarks,
we are not so hesitant to speak.
