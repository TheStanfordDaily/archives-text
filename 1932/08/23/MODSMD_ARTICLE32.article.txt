CONGRESS DANCES—At the Fil

To the jaded moviegoer, surfeited
with American epics on gangsters and
sophistication, this European importa

porary, panacea.

he, the original, frolics in a beer gar

Congress ends abruptly, and the Tsar '■

It's all very delightful, what with
lilting Viennese tunes, romance, pathos,
comedy. Reminds you of a fairytale. i

BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Frank Buck's thrilling expedition
into the depths of the Malayan penin
sula is brought to the s'creen in a
series of smashing episodes of the
jungle. Photographed in a manner
which is a far cry from the ballyhoo
of its precedents such as "Ingagi" or
"Tarzan, the Apeman," this quest for
rare, live species of the animal king
dom is told in a manner which grips
the spectator and practically dispels any
doubts of its authenticity.
Entirely informal, an dabounding in
human appeal, the atmosphere created
is one of humor, tenseness, and per
petual excitement. The lure of the un
expected is grippingly portrayed,
climaxed by a terrific struggle between
an enormous python and a bengal
tiger. If you think that, animals are
unintelligent or if you still hold an
tagonistic views toward the Darwinian
theory, wait until you've seen a mon
key climb a tree and fetch some cocoa
nuts for a toughie baby elephant who
has to be weaned through a bamboo
tube.
A comedy, cartoon, Fox news, and
special act top the program. —J.R.B.
