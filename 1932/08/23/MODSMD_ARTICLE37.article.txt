THE SAME OLD
POST-MORTEM—ALL-STAR TEAMS
Bud Spencer, the dark-spectacled
gentleman who established a world's
record for the 400 meters back in 1928,
when he was running for Stanford,
elevated the beagle the other day in
one of the city papers. That is how
Spencer earns his living these days—
writing sports articles—and he writes
pretty fair stories. This time he became
a little confused, however, in criticizing
the All-American track and field board
team selected by Dean Cromwell, who
earns his living by watching his Troajn
trackmen defeat Stanford each spring.
Spencer took issue with Crom
well's selections because the vet
eran S.C. coach failed to include
Eddie Tolan, Pen Ilallowell, Ralph
Hill, Waller Marty, Bill Miller. Leo
Sexton, John Anderson, and Kenny
Churchill among his paper unbeat
ables.
The man behind the "cheaters" was
only about half right, however. Spencer
didn't take into consideration the fact
that Cromwell was naming a collection
of the greatest American college stars.
Should Cromwell have included ath
letic club and unattached stars in his
estimation, there is little doubt that the
Spencer and Cromwell All-American
teams would have tallied very closely.
"ECHOES" LIFTS
THE BEAGLE TOO
Well, why not? Our guess is as good j
as another, so here's the way we'd pick j
that All-American outfit: •
100 yards—Frank Wykoff.
220 yards—Ralph Metcalfe.
440 yards—William Carr.
880 yards—Ben Eastman.
Mile run—Penrose Ilallowell.
Two-mile run—Henry Brocksmith.
120-yard hurdles—George Saling.
220-yard hurdles—Jack Keller.
Broad jump—Lambert Redd.
High jump—Duncan MacNaughton. j
Pole vault—William Graber.
Shotput—Nellie Gray.
Discus—Robert Jones.
Javelin—Malcolm Metcalf.
Hammer throw—Pete Zaremba.
One-mile relay—Eastman, Carr, ,
Ivan Fuqua, and Karl Warner.
That team probably isn't a great deal
different from yours, or yours, or '
yours, Mr. Cromwell and Mr. Spencer.
We say Wykoff in the century contrary !
to your better judgments, because we |
have watched the "Glendale Grey- j
hound" win sprints dn the Coast for ;
three years and we think he's good
enough for our team, even though he i
didn't show at the final American :
Olympic tryouts. And we say Hallo
well instead of Cunningham in the
mile, Mr. Cromwell, because we only
saw them once, and the Harvard boy
won. Maybe you're right, in that in
stance.
We don't disagree with the
names of Brocksmith, Saling, Kel
ler, Redd, Metcalf, and Zaremba,
because, as we are willing to ad
mit, we don't know a hell of a lot
about it. We substitute the name
of MacNaughton for Van Osdel in
the high jump because MacNaugh
ton was an underdog who came
through, which appealed to our |
romantic nature.
THEY FORGOT
OUR NELLIE GRAY
We have two serious objections. The 1
first is to Cromwell's naming Hugh j
Rhea of Nebraska for his shotputter. >
The Giant Corn-Husker tossed the iron '
ball out 52 feet once early in the sea- ;
son, and then fell back to a consistent
toss of approximately 50 feet and bet
ter. Meanwhile we watched Stanford's
Nellie Gray achieve -51 feet and up
all year, which would appear to make j
him the best collegiate weight man in j
the country. Our second gripe is at j
Spencer's selection of Bill Miller over j
Bill Graber in the pole vault. Realiz- j
ing the heresy of that statement, we!
still think the Trojan is the greater
luminary in the high heavens of the
vaulting pit. That day in the Stanford
Stadium when Miller first cleared 14 i
feet 1% inches for a new world's rec- | 1
ord, we won a dollar. We bet the gum- '
chewer on our left that Graber would
clear the bar, too, and go on to win
the jump-off. Figuratively, we owe him
a dollar, and he gets the call over (
Miller.
As for the relay team, we select 11
Fuqua rather than Ablowich or I j
Gordon to run with Eastman, Carr, j ]
and Warner because wc ate lunch j
with the Hoosier flash when he
was here for the final tryouts, and
he turned out to be a swell guy— :
talked freely about the weather,
wore linen knickers, and played a i
good hand of poker.

Now here's the admission that that 1
was a pretty cheesey way of choosing !
an Ail-American team. We must have j
been thinking ouL loud. Still, that's j
most likely the way it's done.
