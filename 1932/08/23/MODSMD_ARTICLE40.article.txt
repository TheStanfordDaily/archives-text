# HAMILTON PREPARES PROGRAM FOR U.C. TRACK GROUND WORK
## 
### 
Brutus Hamilton, newly appointed
University of California head track
coach, plans considerable work for the
fall season to lay the ground work for
his first campaign at Berkeley next
spring, he said today, on taking over
his new duties.
Hamilton is interested in the possi
bilities of cross-country running for
his newly acquired distance men, and
may also spend much time working
with the hurdlers who will be avail
able during the fall, he indicated.
Work during the fall will probably
cover a fairly long period, but will be
far from intensive, he said. Knowing
relatively little of his material or con
ditions as yet, Hamilton had not at
tempted to draw up definite plans for
the training period.
The new Golden Bear coach will
draw upon an extensive background of
experience both as an athlete and
coach, although in terms of years his
experience is relatively brief. He is 32
years old.
