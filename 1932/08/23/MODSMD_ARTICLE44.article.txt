# WALNUT-FILCHING RODENT IRRITATES YOUNG GARDENER
## 
### 
Manocl da Silveira Soares Cardozo,
graduate student, is an expert on
Brazil. He knows all about nuts, revo
lutions, and the price of air mail over
the Andes.
But when it comes to walnuts that
grow on a tree at 514 Alvarado Row
even Cardozo is stumped. And when
a squirrel complicates matters he is
baffled.
It seems that walnuts don't grow in
Brazil—the chamber of commerce ban
ned them in favor of the home-grown
product. And a squirrel would never
cross the Brazilian chamber of com
merce.
For the past two months a brown
squirrel has been making short shift
of the walnut crop in the yard where
Cardozo is caretaker.
First Cardozo resorted to rocks. The
rodent dodged and chattered in his best
anti-Latin-American style.
Then Cardozo sought to borrow a
shotgun.
"I've only fired a gun once," he ad
mitted, "but maybe I can hit a squir
rel. After all a shotgun has two bar
rels."
The search was useless. Professor's
sons use sling-shots and all guns were
confiscated by game wardens long ago.
Today, two months had passed. Car
dozo looked at the ground. He was
irked. His Latin temperament was
aroused. The yard was strewn with
walnut shells.
Then he looked at the tree. It was
a fine example of arboreal thriftiness—
but walnuts—well, "carramba," there
were no more.
Cardozo was watering the garden
today.
