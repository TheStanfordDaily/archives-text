# Student Ego Hit By "Bawl-Out" Record
## 
### 
Irate students call it the "Bawl
Out"—and it is.
Probably for some thirty years,
according to John Ezra McDowell,
alumni secretary, "scholars" have
thus termed the directory of of
ficers and students, though the
exact date of the coinage is un
known.
Sinc§ 1900 the directory has
been published at Stanford, and
since 1901 each student's units
have been included.
It was not until 1920, when the
most intimate and distressing de
tails of scholastic life were re
vealed in the form of published
grade points for the unfeeling
world to see, that the' title was
fully justified, and received the
poignant title "bawl-out" which it
holds today.
