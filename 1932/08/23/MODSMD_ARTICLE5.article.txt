# MRS. LONDON IS CAMPUS VISITOR
## Novelist's Widow Guest At Writers' Meeting 
### 
"Jack London's short stories, already
popuiar in Europe, are gaining in popu
| larity in the United States," says Char
maine Kittridge London, widow of the
American novelist. Mrs. London was
one of the guests of the League of
Western Writers, which spent Friday
afternoon on the campus.
Mrs. London accompanied her hus
band on many of his trips, including
the voyage of the "Snark." Since that
time she has traveled a great deal in
Europe, speaking on Jack London and
j his works. He is so popular there that
I crowds stood around to see his wife,
! and demanded speech after speech
! from her.
Hanks Jeffers High
Speaking of the popularity of "old
j and new" authors Mrs. London said
j that "we usually find our foremost
i authors among poets." She ranks Rob
inson Jeffers high among the contem
porary California poets, but added,
"My husband preferred, among West
ern writers, George Sterling."
Prompted by a question concerning
the waning popularity of Longfellow,
Mrs. London immediately declared in
favor of his group and their type of
! poetry, admitting a personal preference
| for "reading the legends treated by
these authors. Tennyson, I believe, and
Browning, are beginning to win back
some of their former popularity," she
concluded.
Wrote Biography
Mrs. London writes under the name
i of Charmaine Kittridge, and has pub
| lished a life of her husband, "The Book
! of Jack London," 1921. She is at pres
ent getting out a new edition of this
j "Life" which will be more within the
j reach of many of London's admirers.
Mrs. London had never before at
i tended a convention of writers—"time
I and the desire never coincided"—and
J found the varied program offered the
| group at Stanford very worthwhile.
I The writers arrived at noon when they
j looked at some of the interesting build
. ings on the campus, and were shown
j the Hoover home. During the luncheon
| they listened to several interesting
I speakers, among them Eliot Grinnell
Mears, Dr. Ralph Haswcll Lutz, Dr.
IA. T. Murray, and Professor William
| Hawley Davis. Miss Carol Green Wil
! son, Stanford graduate, was toastmis
| tress.
Some of the writers then went to the
Hoover War Library, and some to the
Jordan Room, where Mrs. Jordan
talked for a few minutes, relating the
various objects in the room to the life
Jof the Stanford educator, Dr. David
[Starr Jordan.
