# U.S. COMMERCE NOT TARGET OF OTTAWA MEET-DR. RUSSELL
## 
### 
In the opinion of Dr. Leonard J.
Russell, acting professor of philosophy
from Birmingham University, England,
Ihe trend of the trade conference at
Ottawa indicates no desire on the part
of England to effect an agreement
which would be detrimental to Ameri
can trade.
In a general way it was indicated by
press reports that Canada's offer to
England would include:
1. Important increases in British
preference on iron and steel products
which would switch $30,000,000 worth
of Canada's orders annually from for
eign to British producers.
2. Revision in textile tariff sched
ules which would divert Canadian
business from American to British
channels.
Explains Trade View
Expanding upon his general state
ment, Dr. Russell explained that Eng
land seeks not to hinder American
prosperity, but to further English pros
perity and eventually the prosperity
of the world. "None of our people," he
said, "would want to enter into agree
ments to the detriment of other coun
tries." This is because Great Britain
exists through trade and must have
prosperous neighbors to buy from her.
Dr. Russell admits that for a short
time following such an agreement as
the Ottawa conference indicates, cer
tain United States industries would ex
perience a falling off in trade. This
condition, however, would be tempor
ary as the increased buying power
this same agreement would give Eng
land would create a greater market for
United States goods.
Tariffs Defensive
Speaking of tariff and the British
policy in this matter, Dr. Russell said:
"If tariffs are advantageous to one na
tion, then, in the end they ought to be
advantageous to all nations.
"Britain is a free trade country, and
the tariffs she liaised have been forced
on her in self-defense." These state
ments, he argues, are proof of Eng
land's wish to further prosperity in all
nations.
