# CHEST DRIVE TO AID CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
Headquarters for the annual Com
munity Chest drive opened yesterday
at 527 Mason street in San Francisco.
The building was loaned for campaign
purposes by the Olympic Club.

The drive opens in November, and
the campaign slogan this year is "Ready
for Action." The Stanford Convalescent
Home is vitally interested in this char
ity affair because 45 per cent of the
Home's income is derived from the
San Francisco Community Chest.
