# Dancer Stages Varied Program
## Vivian Wall Wins Audience With Interpretations 
### 
Completely winning her large audi
ence, Vivian Wall, interpretative and
"self-styled" modernistic dancer, was
called back to the stage for three en
cores after her performance Friday
evening at tiie Stanford Assembly Hall.
Muscular grace, originally designed
costumes, and eccentric but strong
rhythm were the factors which held
the attention of the spectators, for Miss
Wall varied these elements to make
her program delightfully changing.
Three of her ten dances stood out in
in interpretative value. In "Temple of
Labor," an explanation of the new
Russia set to percussion accompani
ment, Miss Wall conveyed a strong
mood and was successful in creating
the feeling that "It will be accom
plished . . . we are building a Tem
ple of Labor."
"Cradle Song," and "La Marseillaise,"
one following the other on the pro
gram, scored with the audience. The
blue sweeping costume and soft l'hyth
mic movements to Brahms' song in the
former dance was followed by a dance
in exotic red and flashing rhythm as
she depicted the spirit of France in
1792.
Mertianna Towler, pianist, and Tecla
Von Osten, percussionist, accompanied
Miss Wall.
