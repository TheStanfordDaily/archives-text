# BLOCH'S CAREER TOLD BY DOWNES IN CLOSING TALK
## New York Times Music Critic Concludes Series Of Talks Here Yesterday Shows How Composer Used Modern Music Tendencies With Originality 
### 
A portrait of Ernest Bloch and the
rendition of his quintet for piano and
string quartet concluded the series of
twelve lectures on music by Olin
Downes last night in the Assembly
Hall.
"This Jewish composer has utilized
modern tendencies in music in an en
tirely original way, combining poly
harmonies and poly-tonalities to suit
his own expression," Downes stated.
"In fact, he has reversed the order of
theme introduction, presenting the en
riched theme of double notes in the
first movement instead of the second,
and the single notes in the second in
stead of in the introductory move
ment."
Five Notes in Quintet
The first theme of the Bloch quintet
is based upon five notes, which
Downes explained on the piano. In the
second movement the mood is mystical,
and could well have been written for
the Jewish drama, "Dybukk." in his
opinion. The third movement reveals
a transformation of the theme into a
march rhythm.
"Perhaps Bloch has achieved what I
would call a masterpiece because he
has not followed the classic sonata
form," Downes said. "The development
of his themes has been so contrapuntal
in effect as to be thoroughly different
from any quintet written previously.

The Nathan Abas String Quartet

and tonal coloring, Downes playing the
piano part.
This concert-lecture marked the con
clusion of the Downes series for the
summer. The New York Times critic
plans to return East within a few days.
