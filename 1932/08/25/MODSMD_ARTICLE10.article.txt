# Mrs. Brown To Read Prize Play
## "Of Thee I Sing" To Be Given On Campus Tuesday 
### 
i The rollicking and apt satire of
! American politics and national life, "Of
j Thee I Sing," will be read by Mrs.
j Hugh Brown at 8 o'clock. August 30,
lin the Assembly Hall. The presenta-
I tion of this Broadway hit and 1932
j Pulitzer prize winner will conclude the
! Tuesday evening series of programs
for the summer quarter.
; "Of Thee 1 Sing," written by George
|S. Kaufman and Maurice Ryskind, is
| a musical comedy, the first production
jof its type to win a Pulitzer prize.
; Saucy and clever, it moves with light
! ning speed, overlooking no element of
l national life from the Supereme Court
to bathing beauty contests and the
press. Ira Gershwin wrote the lyrics
which are as deft and surprising as the
lines.
The play opens with the campaign
of John P. Wintergreen for President.
[ "Vote for Prosperity and See What
j You Get," and "Wintergreenâ€”A Man's
I Man's Man," are two of the campaign
j banners. A bathing beauty contest
chooses the belle of the Southland to
be the President's wife, but the candi
date throws la monkey-wrench into
the party machinery by falling in love
with Mary. Mary and John run the
White House and the nation most
j amusingly, and the spurned beauty
| contest winner makes marvelous trou
! ble for the President.
The play is "Reductio ad Absurdum,"
j yet it has unmistakable merit. As
i George Jean Nathan says in the fore
j word, "Pour a couple of cocktails into
| your sobriety" and come and listen to
j this impertinent but brilliant lampoon .
I of American life,
