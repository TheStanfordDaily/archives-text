Germany will be ruled by force un
til a working majority can be formed
in the newly elected Reichstag, Pro
fessor H. Lutz, Stanford his
torian, prophecied Tuesday night in
the Stanford Assembly Hall.
"The modern German cannot be con
trolled by force for long. The nation
that survived the attacks of the Iron
Chancellor will never succumb to a
man of Hitler's calibre," he continued.
Lutz pointed out that interest in
Germany was well founded. There are
over $2,300,000,000 of American money
invested in that country, the center
of European depression, which amounts
to 41 per cent of all foreign invest
ments there. Moreover, Germany is a
good customer of America; she im
ports raw materials as well as ma
chined goods.
Before describing the presidential
election of last spring, the Prussian
state election of April 24, and the
Reichstag election of July 31, Lutz re
viewed the economic and political his
tory preceding the present crisis. The
elections he illustrated with German
political posters used in the campaigns.
"The middle class is the dangerous
element in Germany today," Lutz de
clared. "During the last 14 years this
class has suffered a revolution, the
Versailles treaty, the collapse of the
currency, and general economic chaos.
The future of Germany is the future
of her middle class," he concluded.
