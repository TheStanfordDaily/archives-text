# C. C. LANE BEQUEST TESTED AS STANFORD RIGHTS CHALLENGED
## 
### 
University officials have no definite
information regarding the provisions
of the Lane bequest to Stanford, which
is now being contested in the Superior
Court of San Francisco.
The amount available for Stanford
in case the will is upheld will not be
known until after the suit is settled,
according to the comptroller's office.
Whether the bequest is for a certain
purpose, or for use in the general fund,
is not known here.
The contest is being brought by four
direct heirs of Dr. Charles Cameron
Lane of San Francisco, who died Janu
ary 30, cutting off his relatives with
only $20 each. The contestants claim
that when the will was signed on Sep
tember 19, 1929, Dr. Lane was of un
sound mind and under the influence
of Charlotte Hoida, to whom ยง30.000
was bequeathed.
If the contest is not upheld, the bal
ance of the Lane estate, after terms of
the will have been fulfilled, will be
divided equally between Stanford and
the University of California.
