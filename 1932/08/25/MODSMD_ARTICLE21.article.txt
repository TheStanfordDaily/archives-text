# KAYE TO REPRESENT FARM AT CHEMISTRY MEETING IN DENVER
## 
### 
William A. Kaye, graduate chemistry
student, will represent the Stanford
chapter of Phi Lambda Upsilon, hon
| orary chemistry society, at the national
I meeting to be held in Denver, Colo
| rado, August 26-27. Kaye takes the
j place of Robert Rowe, president of the
| chapter, who will be kept from at-
I tending by his work with the Carnegie
i Foundation.
The Stanford chapter of Phi Lambda
j Upsilon is a leader in national affairs
| and on the campus. The organization
ranks first in scholarship at Stanford.
Kaye will accompany Professors F. W.
Bergstrom and P. A. Leighton and Mr.
F. A. Blacet of the chemistry depai't
j ment, all of whom will read papers at
I the meeting of the American Chemical
j Society which is meeting in Denver
| on August 22.
Professor Leighton will read a paper
on "The Photochemistry of Ammonia,"
| which deals with the decomposition of
| ammonia vapour. This will be an ex
planation of an experiment, and its
value lies in an increased knowledge
of the nature and properties of am
â–  monia. One of the objects of the ex
j periment was to work out the mechan
i ism of light on ammonia molecules.
