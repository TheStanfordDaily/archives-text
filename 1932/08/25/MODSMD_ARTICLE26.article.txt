# LOCAL AIRPLANE DESIGN TO ENTER NATIONAL RACES
## Ship Designed On Campus Set For L.A.-Cleveland Hop On Saturday Elliott Reid And Alfred Niles Embody Innovations In New Air Craft 
### 
I The brain-creation of two Stanford
| professors will be entered in the Ben
dix Air Race, which takes place Sat
; urday. The contestants start in Los
I Angeles and finish in Cleveland in
! time for the National Air Show.
| The plane is a new type cargo-air
plane, and was designed by Professors
Elliott Reid and Alfred S. Niles, of the
Guggenheim Foundation. It has a great
many innovations in design, and much
is expected in the race. The ship will
j fly non-stop from Los Angeles, and,
| although it is hardly expected to win,
| a.s there are a number of racing planes
| entered, excellent results will in all
j probability be the result of this plane's
| effort.
Plane Described
I 'The plane is a single-motored can
; tilever monoplane designed for the
i high-speed transportation of mail and
I express within its extraordinary thick
, wing, says Professor Reid. Sixteen
i hundred pounds of freight can be
j transported easily. The machine is un
i conventional, in that is has no fuselage.
! The tail surfaces are carried on two
i booms which project to the rear. The
1 pilot and engine are enclosed within it
: nacelle which is 'faired' into the lead
j ing edge of the wing."
Reid declares that important reduc
| tions of resistance have been made by
; these somewhat radical departures in
design. He believes that the plane
marks a distinct advance in high
! speed aircraft.
Made Fast Time
The plane is powered with a 500-
S horsepower supercharged Wasp en
! gine. In a recent test it flew over 150
; miles per hour with a load of 1000
j pounds more than the designer's fig—
jure. At the present time the cargo
spaces are used to carry gasoline, 1200
; gallons being the maximum load.
Designed for the Vance Airlines, the
I ship should prove extremely successful
jon the Western mail runs, for best
! cruising speeds are reached at an alti
! tude of 9000 feet.
It is also the first plane to use the
j Hamilton controllable-pitch propellor
for other than experimental purposes.
