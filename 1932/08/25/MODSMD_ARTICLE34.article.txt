# A PARTING GIFT

### 
Hvery student li;is a chance al Ihe close of Ihe quarter lo
make ;i small I>ijl useful gift lo Ihe Convalescent Nome. Prolils
j'roni I lie sale of Ihe grade envelopes tire given lo this Stanford
charily project.
hi Ihe past, lhe sale of these envelopes lo several hundred
students each quarter has netted Ihe I lonic a sum which, though
modest, has been appreciated and put to good use.
This quarter, due to Ihe increase in postal rates, the profits
will he cut considerably, as the cost of Ihe envelope has re
mained I lie same.
If every Stanford man and woman would use these special
envelopes for their grades, it would aid in balancing this loss.
II is a worthy cause, and of practical value lo Ihe student as
well as lo Ihe Convalescent Home.
