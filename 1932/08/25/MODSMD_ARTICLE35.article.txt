Statistics compiled by alumni olliecs of Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton definitely spiked the widespread belief liiat four
years in college are equal in educational value to two good
house parties. The ligurcs showed that il actually "pays'" to go
to college . . . thai the graduate who lias a sheep-skin stored
away in the attic makes more money, yearly, than his friends
who never experienced a college education.
For instance, Harvard men owned higher - priced cars;
Princeton men smoked more cigars; Vale men went lo Europe
more often. Hut there is one form of reward llial Ihe statistics
omitted. \Ye can only quote Mark Twain on il, for lie summed
i!. up so admirably. And that is the "pay" one gets for doing
intellectual work.
"Intellectual work." said Mark Twain, "is misnamed. Il is
a pleasure, a dissipation, and is ils own biggest reward. The
poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor,
painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer,
is constructively in heaven when he is at work. And as for the
musician with fiddle-bow in hand, who sils in the midst of a
great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing lides of divine
sound washing over him why certainly he is al work, if you
wish lo call il that, but lord, it's a sarcasm jusl Ihe same. The
