# M'CORMICK CLAIMS KIDNAPPING PROBLEM NOT A MAJOR ISSUE
## 
### 
"Kidnapping will probably never be
as important a problem as those crimes
which are more or less tolerated by
the public," said Charles T. McCor
mick, acting professor of law at Stan
ford during the summer quarter.
"There is a strong public feeling in re
gard to kidnapping, and gangdom is
forced to rely for its power on prac
tices which will not arouse public dis
favor to the point where there shall
be an uprising against them.' Mc-
Cormick is a member of the faculty
of Northwestern University.
It is McCormick's belief that college
students should be interested in mat
ters of national importance, and he be
lieves that the universities are turning
out men who will be well-trained to
hold public office as well as politically
minded men who are not interested in
politics as a career.
"The universities are working with
public departments, as in Northwestern
where there is a crime detection de
partment which works with the police,
McCormick said. "The citizenship
course required ol freshmen at Stan
ford is one which should do much to
foster this growing interest."
