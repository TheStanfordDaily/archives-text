# RETURN TO COUNTRY MOVEMENT REVEALS UNEMPLOYED HOPES
## 
### 
There is a movement at present
among industrially unemployed people
to go buck to the rural life and farm
ing, according to W. G. Beach, pro
fessor of social science.
"The depression," says Beach, '"has
made many people deem it easier to
move out into the country and raise
their own food on which to survive,
rather than to attempt making money
with which to buy food.
"Beliefs about buying and operating
a farm are being carried to a greater
extent every day. A majority of people
who take such action fail to realize
the hazards which they are bound to
encounter.
"For those who know a little about
agriculture, the task oj' operating their
own small ranch would be compara
tively easy. But to the person who un
derstands practically nothing concern
ing the running a country home,
and who has no capital to aid him,
the task becomes difficult. That per
son would be better off back in the
city."
The various State Departments of
Agriculture, in different parts of the
country, are constantly being called
upon by city people to give informa
tion regarding farm lands, Beach said.
