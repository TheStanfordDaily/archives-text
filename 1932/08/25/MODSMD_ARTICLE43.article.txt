MISS PINKEHTOX—At the Stanford
Theatre.
Mary Roberts Hinehart penned this
for the Saturday Evening Post, and on
| being transposed to the screen it re
ceived some intelligent handling and an
i excellent cast, which results in its being
: a commendable picture.
i Deserting her usual chorus girl,
; woman of the world, gold-digger role,
; pleasingly plump Joan Blondell is the
j nurse, working under police orders.
She's the kind of nurse you'd like to

j have around the next time you have
your tonsils or appendix yanked out.
George Brent, swarthy and big-eared,
who is being boomed by the Warners
j as competition for Clark Gable, is ap
: pealing as the man from headquarters
I who stalks about with a revolver in one
hand and wears his chin in a jaunty,
determined angle. The plot is novel, the
| dialogue crisp. For instance: A reporter
ups to a cop and bellows, "I'm the
! MORNING EAGLE," to which the cop
i swifties back, "Aw go feather your
I nest." —E.L.
