LOOKING HACK
OVER A GOOD SUMMER
The summer quarter student who
plays around the yolf course once or
twice a week, violates the sanctity of
the varsity courts with his ineffectual
tennis, and cools himself in the Encina
pools can point with pride . . . Al
though the Stanford man has no world's
championship team, corresponding to
the great Blue and Gold crew, about
which he can broadcast his praise—he
can, nevertheless, point with pride to
the individual achievements of several
of his campus brethren who have set
a record in the world of sport unex
celled by the undergraduates of any
one college in a single season.
In the first place, take track.
Ben Eastman placed second in the
Olympic 400-meter race and ran a
lap on the world's record-breaking
fliOO-meter relay team. Bill Miller
broke the world's record to win
the Olympic pole vault. Nellie
Gray was fifth in the shot put at
Los Angeles. Here Laborde was
second in the discus, establishing
himself as the foremost platter
tosser in collegiate circles.
Ted Wiget and Frank Booth, two of
Coach Ernie Brandsten's tank stars,
won berths on the U.S. Olympic swim
ming squad. Bill .Harding was a mem
ber of the American rifle entry. Sev
eral Indian gridmeri of the 1931 var
sity* teamed with their former rivals
from Berkeley and Southern California
'to defeat the Eastern Big Three in the
Olympic exhibition game of football.
Keith Glcdhill, captain of the
Stanford netmen, packed his rack
ets into the East in the late spring.
There he has made an excellent
record in various sectional and in
vitational tournaments. Paired with
Joe Coughlin, next year's captain,
'Glcdhill annexed several early
tournament doubles titles. . More
recently the Stanford star has be
come the doubles partner of Ells
worth Vines, national singles cham
pion. The Vines-Gledhill combina
tion has appeared unbeatable to
date, defeating Allison and Van
Ryn, last year's doubles titlists, on
one occasion.
The Farm's golf stars have also had
a successful summer. Stuart Hawley
was among the San Francisco district
qualifiers for the National amateur
championship tourney to be held in
Boston. Charlie Seaver and Harry
Eichelberger qualified for the Los An
geles entry at Baltimore and are now
playing in the Western amateur at
Rockford, Illinois.
AND LOOKING
TOWARD THE FUTURE
It sort of gives the oldtimer who has
spent three of his six undergraduate
years at Stanford a sorry feeling when
he thinks of all the athletic heroes
whom he has seen in action for the
Cardinal for the last time —the late
Krenz, Rothert, Smalling, Heinecke,
Desjardins, Doeg, Gledhill, Little, Mof
fatt, Fawcett, Clapp, Throndson, and
on and on.
But there will undoubtedly be
other "greats" who will represent
the Farm in the Oval, in the Sta
dium. in the Pavilion, in Encina
Pools, on the varsity courts, and
on the links. As things look now,
with the summer heat still steam
ing in our heads, Stanford's past
sport immortals will be adequately
replaced during the forthcoming
year.
As this coiumn has consistently
pointed out, Pop Warner has the pros
pect for his best football team in three
years, providing, of course, that in
juries do not rob the old maestro of
football of half his squad. John Bunn
should meet a casaba squad this win
ter more thoroughly trained in the
principles of his style of basketball and
turn out a team which will boost Stan
ford's conference standing. Baseball
seems to have suffered the most
through the turn of another college
year, but Coach Harry Wolter will
have all his varsity batteries for an
other season's nucleus.
As for track. Dink Templeton
will have Ben Eastman, Bill Miller.
Nellie Gray, and Here Laborde
around whom to build a varsity.
That quartet is a better track team
in itself than the average college
mentor finds within his locker
rooms in a five-year span. But
Templeton will have his worries.
It takes a team strong in every
event to make great progress these
days, with Dean Cromwell turning
out such well-rounded track ma
chines at Southern California.
Stanford will need sprinters, for
Lcs Hablcs and Frank Lombardi,
who might have developed into the
classiest sprint duo in the coun
try, arc both uncertain quantities
as the result of constantly recurring
injuries and illnesses.
The swimming team?—as good as
ever, which means that the Indians
will win all their dual collegiate meets
and have a perfect water polo record.
The tennis team will have a much
tougher time in retaining the Cardinal
supremacy on the coast, but the Stan
ford golfers still look like the best
masliie-wavers of the collegiate crop.
Ah well, they come and go—Stan
ford's champions.

a successful summer. Stuart Hawley
was among the San Francisco district
qualifiers for the National amateur
championship tourney to be held in
Boston. Charlie Seaver and Harry
Eichelberger qualified for the Los An
geles entry at Baltimore and are now
playing in the Western amateur at
Rockford, Illinois.
AND LOOKING
TOWARD THE FUTURE
It sort of gives the oldtimer who has
spent three of his six undergraduate
years at Stanford a sorry feeling when
he thinks of all the athletic heroes
whom he has seen in action for the
Cardinal for the last time —the late
Krenz, Rothert, Smalling, Heinecke,
Desjardins, Doeg, Gledhill, Little, Mof
fatt, Fawcett, Clapp, Throndson, and
on and on.
But there will undoubtedly be
other "greats" who will represent
the Farm in the Oval, in the Sta
dium. in the Pavilion, in Encina
Pools, on the varsity courts, and
on the links. As things look now,
with the summer heat still steam
ing in our heads, Stanford's past
sport immortals will be adequately
replaced during the forthcoming
year.
As this coiumn has consistently
pointed out, Pop Warner has the pros
pect for his best football team in three
years, providing, of course, that in
juries do not rob the old maestro of
football of half his squad. John Bunn
should meet a casaba squad this win
ter more thoroughly trained in the
principles of his style of basketball and
turn out a team which will boost Stan
ford's conference standing. Baseball
seems to have suffered the most
through the turn of another college
year, but Coach Harry Wolter will
have all his varsity batteries for an
other season's nucleus.
As for track. Dink Templeton
will have Ben Eastman, Bill Miller.
Nellie Gray, and Here Laborde
around whom to build a varsity.
That quartet is a better track team
in itself than the average college
mentor finds within his locker
rooms in a five-year span. But
Templeton will have his worries.
It takes a team strong in every
event to make great progress these
days, with Dean Cromwell turning
out such well-rounded track ma
chines at Southern California.
Stanford will need sprinters, for
Lcs Hablcs and Frank Lombardi,
who might have developed into the
classiest sprint duo in the coun
try, arc both uncertain quantities
as the result of constantly recurring
injuries and illnesses.
The swimming team?—as good as
ever, which means that the Indians
will win all their dual collegiate meets
and have a perfect water polo record.
The tennis team will have a much
tougher time in retaining the Cardinal
supremacy on the coast, but the Stan
ford golfers still look like the best
masliie-wavers of the collegiate crop.
Ah well, they come and go—Stan
ford's champions.

The summer quarter student who
plays around the yolf course once or

the varsity courts with his ineffectual
tennis, and cools himself in the Encina

the great Blue and Gold crew, about

Ben Eastman placed second in the
Olympic 400-meter race and ran a

Los Angeles. Here Laborde was
second in the discus, establishing
himself as the foremost platter

Ted Wiget and Frank Booth, two of
Coach Ernie Brandsten's tank stars,
won berths on the U.S. Olympic swim

from Berkeley and Southern California
'to defeat the Eastern Big Three in the
Olympic exhibition game of football.
Keith Glcdhill, captain of the
Stanford netmen, packed his rack

There he has made an excellent
record in various sectional and in
vitational tournaments. Paired with
Joe Coughlin, next year's captain,

tournament doubles titles. . More
recently the Stanford star has be

LOOKING HACK
OVER A GOOD SUMMER
The summer quarter student who
plays around the yolf course once or
twice a week, violates the sanctity of
the varsity courts with his ineffectual
tennis, and cools himself in the Encina
pools can point with pride . . . Al
though the Stanford man has no world's
championship team, corresponding to
the great Blue and Gold crew, about
which he can broadcast his praise—he
can, nevertheless, point with pride to
the individual achievements of several
of his campus brethren who have set
a record in the world of sport unex
celled by the undergraduates of any
one college in a single season.
In the first place, take track.
Ben Eastman placed second in the
Olympic 400-meter race and ran a
lap on the world's record-breaking
fliOO-meter relay team. Bill Miller
broke the world's record to win
the Olympic pole vault. Nellie
Gray was fifth in the shot put at
Los Angeles. Here Laborde was
second in the discus, establishing
himself as the foremost platter
tosser in collegiate circles.
Ted Wiget and Frank Booth, two of
Coach Ernie Brandsten's tank stars,
won berths on the U.S. Olympic swim
ming squad. Bill .Harding was a mem
ber of the American rifle entry. Sev
eral Indian gridmeri of the 1931 var
sity* teamed with their former rivals
from Berkeley and Southern California
'to defeat the Eastern Big Three in the
Olympic exhibition game of football.
Keith Glcdhill, captain of the
Stanford netmen, packed his rack
ets into the East in the late spring.
There he has made an excellent
record in various sectional and in
vitational tournaments. Paired with
Joe Coughlin, next year's captain,
'Glcdhill annexed several early
tournament doubles titles. . More
recently the Stanford star has be
come the doubles partner of Ells
worth Vines, national singles cham
pion. The Vines-Gledhill combina
tion has appeared unbeatable to
date, defeating Allison and Van
Ryn, last year's doubles titlists, on
one occasion.
The Farm's golf stars have also had
a successful summer. Stuart Hawley
was among the San Francisco district
qualifiers for the National amateur
championship tourney to be held in
Boston. Charlie Seaver and Harry
Eichelberger qualified for the Los An
geles entry at Baltimore and are now
playing in the Western amateur at
Rockford, Illinois.
AND LOOKING
TOWARD THE FUTURE
It sort of gives the oldtimer who has
spent three of his six undergraduate
years at Stanford a sorry feeling when
he thinks of all the athletic heroes
whom he has seen in action for the
Cardinal for the last time —the late
Krenz, Rothert, Smalling, Heinecke,
Desjardins, Doeg, Gledhill, Little, Mof
fatt, Fawcett, Clapp, Throndson, and
on and on.
But there will undoubtedly be
other "greats" who will represent
the Farm in the Oval, in the Sta
dium. in the Pavilion, in Encina
Pools, on the varsity courts, and
on the links. As things look now,
with the summer heat still steam
ing in our heads, Stanford's past
sport immortals will be adequately
replaced during the forthcoming
year.
As this coiumn has consistently
pointed out, Pop Warner has the pros
pect for his best football team in three
years, providing, of course, that in
juries do not rob the old maestro of
football of half his squad. John Bunn
should meet a casaba squad this win
ter more thoroughly trained in the
principles of his style of basketball and
turn out a team which will boost Stan
ford's conference standing. Baseball
seems to have suffered the most
through the turn of another college
year, but Coach Harry Wolter will
have all his varsity batteries for an
other season's nucleus.
As for track. Dink Templeton
will have Ben Eastman, Bill Miller.
Nellie Gray, and Here Laborde
around whom to build a varsity.
That quartet is a better track team
in itself than the average college
mentor finds within his locker
rooms in a five-year span. But
Templeton will have his worries.
It takes a team strong in every
event to make great progress these
days, with Dean Cromwell turning
out such well-rounded track ma
chines at Southern California.
Stanford will need sprinters, for
Lcs Hablcs and Frank Lombardi,
who might have developed into the
classiest sprint duo in the coun
try, arc both uncertain quantities
as the result of constantly recurring
injuries and illnesses.
The swimming team?—as good as
ever, which means that the Indians
will win all their dual collegiate meets
and have a perfect water polo record.

supremacy on the coast, but the Stan

Ah well, they come and go—Stan
