# TYPEWRITER REPAIR MEN WORK MIRACLES ON BATTERED KEYS
## 
### 
Few students realize that one of the
most highly developed of the technical
departments at Stanford is to be found
—-not in the engineering labs or the
mathematics building — but in the
Bookstore. There it is that rental type
writers are kept in perfect condition,
or nearly so, and there it is that new
machines are reassembled, with acces
sories, to suit the buyer.
University students find a great need
for special keyboards for use in their
courses, and Joe Kern, head of the re
pair shop, says that eight out of every
ten new typewriters sold in his depart
ment are equipped with special sets
of keys and types for use in mathe
matics and foreign languages.
It is an interesting fact that this de
partment keeps reports from the police
department, listing the numbers of
stolen machines, which may have come
into the possession of students, one
way or another. Through listing the
serial numbers of all typewriters which
come in for repairs the shop men are
often able to assist students in locating
their lost machines.
