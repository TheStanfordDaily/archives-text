# CHANGE OF COLLEGE NOT UNCOMMON IN GERMANY-LEWIN
## 
### 
Because a student has attended sev
eral universities does not mean he is a
deficient scholar or a social misfit in
Germany, according to Dr. Kurt Lewin,
acting professoY of psychology during
the summer quarter, from the Univer
sity of Berlin. In Germany students
usually change schools during their
first semesters so that they may con
| tact more men and opinions before
; they crystallize their own beliefs, and
i find the university best for them to
attend.
Lewin believes there is at Stanford
a high intellectual standard in gradu
ate students, a critical and serious atti
tude toward research and finds a simi
larity to Berlin University in this re-
I spC';i_.
In Berlin students may live wher
i ever they please, with sex and class
disregard. This is due to the age of
German students who, when begin -
j ning college, are about two years
i older than the average freshman at
j Stanford. There are few regulations
! for the woman student.
"We have no beautiful campus such
!as this," he remarked. "At one time
! we attempted a start in the suburbs of
Berlin but the university could not
complete the plan to move there.
"The tendency since the war," he
I continued, "is toward self- or partial
self-support. This is extremely diffi
cult because there is little possibility
; for work of a few hours. For instance,
Germans do not eat at the same time
in the day so' that a student cannot
I 'hash' only at the noon hour, but must
! be on the job all day." He also said
that in the city of Berlin the large
! number of unemployed has made it
difficult for students to find positions
I of this type.
