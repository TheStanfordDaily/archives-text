# ADVERTISERS TURN TO PRINTED MATTER FOR POSTAGE SAVING
## 
### 
The only people apparently affected
by the new three-cent postage are
those that have been in the habit of
sending quite a bit of advertising mat
ter through the first-class mail chan
nels, according to Postmaster W. C.
Werry. These have turned to using
printed matter and post-cards to serve
their ends; taking advantage of the
lower postage rates on the second- and
third-class material. The general pub
lic seems quite apathetic concerning
the increase in cost of sending a letter.
Werry also noted that Stanford stu
dents ia the summer quarter do not
receive as many special letters as do
regular session students. There are
3500 students attending during regular
session. To these there come approxi
mately 35 special letters daily. To the
950 students in summer session come
only four or five a day.
Werry also brings attention to the
fact that regular session students send
ntore laundry home than do the sum
mer students. From 50 to 75 packages
of laundry per week are sent to dif
ferent. parts of the state during regular
session. Only 8 to 10 per week are sent
during the summer.
