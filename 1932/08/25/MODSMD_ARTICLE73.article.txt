# Roble Rascals Romp In Recreation Room
## 
### 
Roble women now dance to radio
jazz, play cards, listen to concerts, or
gather to talk, where once trunks from
many sections of the country were
piled row on row.
Gone are the trunks and the bare
ness of a storeroom, and in their place
have appeared comfortable chairs,
bright lamps, and walls pleasantly
bung with posters. Ruble women have
a new recreation room in the
of B wing.
It was furnished during spring quar
ter from an accumulation in the break
age fund, an dis a pleasant reward to
Roble inmates for their care of the
hall.
Though -it is intended primarily for
members' use, occasionally men will be
entertained in its sanctuary ... so
the rumor goes . . . at informal hall
functions.
