# Change Management Of Campus Gas, Oil Station
## 
### 
! Changing management and person
nel, the campus filling station is being
! re-equipped for fall quarter. The sta
-1 tion will be managed by Art McGarr,
I'3l. Heretofore the University operated
| this concession, firemen taking shifts
of duty at the station as service men.
Showing faith in Stanford men's de-
I pendability, McGarr says that charge
| accounts will be a feature of the new
I station. A new greasing outfit has been
installed at a cost of $1100, so that
| complete service will be available.
