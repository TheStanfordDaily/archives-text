A Timely Trade-in Sale
for the New Term of School
and the New Business Upturn
To reduce retailers' stocks for late fall and Christmas
shipments, Parker offers you a $1.25 to $2.50 cash
allowance for your old pen on the new streamlined
Parker Duofold Pen, or 75c to $l.OO for an old mechani
cal pencil on a fine new streamlined Duofold Pencil.
The Duofolds offered are NOT discontinued models,
but Parker's finest and latest—exclusive jewel-like
colors in non-breakable Permanite—Sea Green and
Black, Black and Pearl, Black, Jade, and others—all
gold mounted, and all with Parker's super-smooth,
"special-order" Duofold point, extra ink capacity, and
quick-starting, non-clogging feed.
The Pens and Pencils you trade in do not have to be
Parkers. We only require that the old pen have a 14k
gold point.
So ransack the home and office for old pens and
pencils. Take them to the nearest pen counter, trade
them in, like cash, and walk out with a brand new
Parker Duofold Pen or Pencil, or both. But hurry—
