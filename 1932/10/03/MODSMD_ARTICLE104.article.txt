The recent action of the Pa
cific Association of the A.A.U.
in electing a non-university slate
of officers and committeemen
has brought to the boiling point
a situation that has been sim
mering for a long time.
The outstanding achievement of
the P.A.A. each year is its spring
track meet held in Kezar Stadium.
For a long time the college stars of
the Bay region have been largely
responsible for its success. Stanford,
for example, has sent its team, at
its own expense, and has gotten
absolutely nothing out of the deal.
Stanford, California, Santa Clara,
St. Mary's, and S.F.U. are all sup
posed to be represented. For some
time now the meetings of the asso
ciation have been such farces that
none of the colleges except Stan
ford have bothered to even send
representatives. However, this final
thrust will probably prove the straw
that crushes the camel's back.
The P.A.A. needs the colleges; but
the colleges do not need the P.A.A.
It is not necessary to the recognition
of records nor is it particularly out
standing in its relation to amateur
sports. The men who head, and
have headed for the last four years,
the P.A.A. are not university men,
they do not understand university
problems, and they are not overly
sympathetic towards the universities
as universities.
The universities have been
largely instrumental in the suc
cess of the P.A.A. while having
nothing to do with its policies or
its management. It looks very
much as if those who profited
most from the golden eggs have
killed the golden goose.

With the word "Olympic" very
much taboo, and the word "track"
not very far behind, loyal fans
nevertheless are looking forward to
the next track season, and Stanford's
prospects for more honors on the
cinder tracks of the nation.
Having this in mind they were no
doubt startled to hear that Brutus
Hamilton, Berkeley's brand new
track coach, had revived cross-coun
try and intended to turn out some
long-distance runners who would be
without peers on the coast.
And now, we hear it whisp
ered about that the venerable
Stanford Indian himself is about
to hit the long trail, and he may
even arrange to have a few se
lect S.F.U. Dons and Berkeley
Bears try to pace him on these
weary; treks. Well, we could
stand a few good distance run
ners down here on the penin
sula!

We would like to know: how
"Clipper" Smith feels this morning
after beating California and then
losing to Oregon; why Ed Lettunich,
who was boomed as first string ma
terial here at Stanford, didn't ac
company the team to Portland; why
Dave Packard, who is big, fast and
clever doesn't get "steamed up"
enough to be the battling terror

that he should be; how much longer
Stanford can stay in the underrated
class now that the varsity has shown
both a powerful running and passing
attack; why city papers insist that
the fullback material is weak when
there are men like Anderson and
Baker to back up Jack Hillman;
whether Bill Ingram is really having
a tough time finding a good first
string or is trying some more of his
pet psychology; what Howard Jones
will do to pull his overrated team
out of the doldrums.

Although most people around here
don't know it, Stanford had a man
on the Olympic Riflle Team, and
furthermore he was the high-rank
ing American when the individual
returns came in. That man was
Bill Harding, and he was one of the
best on Stanford's mythical national
champion rifle team last year. It
looks like Bill will be sporting a
block "S" for competing in a sport
which most people overlook on this
campus.
And the funny thing about it
is that he came out for it merely
because some of his friends
found out that he had a rifle
and "had shot a little." He took
away the Rifle Club's 30-caliber
prize cup the first day that he
came out, and there were a lot
of mighty sweet shots competing
i who had a place all cleaned on
the old bureau for the Legion's
contribution to Stanford marks
manship.
