# FROSH SWIMMERS, DIVERS ASKED TO SIGN UP ON QUAD
## 
### 
Despite the fact that some twenty
men had registered for freshman
swimming by Saturday afternoon,
Assistant â€¢ Coach Nort Thornton has
issued a call for further material.
Competition will be stiff this year,
according to Thornton, due to the
fact that most of the good Coast high
school material has flocked to Cali
fornia. The Bears have appointed
a new coach this year, A1 Dowden.
Dowden used to coach the Fullerton
High team and when he migrated
to Berkeley his Southern California
championship water polo team mi
grated with him. So six of the men
who gained Fullerton High its third
consecutive championship are to be
found among the California fresh
men today.
Especially does Thornton want
divers, always a rarity, and anyone
who has had diving experience is
urged to report. Thornton will be at
the Encina pools any time after 2
o'clock all this week, and will wel
come any promising material.
