# Thornton Fears Water-Polo Squad Weak, Sees Second Loss To Trojans
## 
### 
Last year Stanford lost the Pa
cific Coast water polo championship
for the first time in sixteen years,
and Assistant Coach Nort Thornton
predicts that again this year, unless
the present varsity material im
proves considerably, a repetition of
that Trojan victory is on the horizon.
Thornton gives the varsity team,
greatly diminished in power by the
loss of Austin Clapp, Frank Booth,
Larry Harris, and Ward Woods, an
outside chance to squash Southern
California this season if plenty of
progress is shown and a much better
team than the present collection
emerges.
In other words, Thornton consid
ers the present material as good in
experienced stuff, but unless every
man changes into an experienced
player with plenty of polish there
will be another Trojan trouncing this
year. Last year's 5 to 4 score was
pretty close, but it takes a lot to
reverse the figures. Determination,
plus the right attitude, will turn the
trick, thinks Thornton.
Indian strength will be built
around Ted Wiget at forward, Don

Kinkead at center back, and Cap
tain Burke Knapp at goal, all of
whom are veterans. Kinkead and
Knapp are all-coast team players,
and Wiget was named last year on
the second all-coast team.
Plenty of good candidates, inex
perienced as they are, have shown
up this year. Thornton names Page
Edwards, Jimmy Triolo, Paul de-
Silva, George Schmidt, and Jimmy
Benet as likely competitors for the
forward berths, Graves, Hirsch,
Taranik, Tebbetts, McDowell, Cap
ers, and Fry for guard positions,
and Kalenborn and Cook for goalie
jobs.
