Names and faces new to Card grid
! fans are now forming a large part
i of the power that has steamrolled
! its way'to victories over the Olym
pic Club, University of San Fran

crease the apprehension felt on the
Farm over the graduation of such
former stars as "Phantom Phil"
Moffatt, Harry Hillman, Spud Hardy,
Chuck Ehrhorn, Red Hand, and Ray
Dawson.

tirely new to Staniford is Bill Sim,

©n the Gray squad.
Jack Hillman and Gordy Camp
bell, although, not new to the var
sity squad, are entering their initial

year but has as his chief claim to

©n the Gray squad.
Jack Hillman and Gordy Camp
bell, although, not new to the var
sity squad, are entering their initial
season as first-string quarter and
fullback. It was in the last game
of the 1931 season against Dart
mouth that Hillman first served no
tice that he would be heard from

this year. Here Laborde, at tackle,
was a member of the squad last
year but has as his chief claim to
fame his second-place in the discus
in the Olympic Games.
Bill Bates, a member of the start
ing lineup against Oregon State,
moved into the first-string center
job last fall just previous to the
Dartmouth game but was robbed of
his chance by an attack of appendi
citis which kept him in a Boston
hospital during the game.
Other members of the starting
lineup Saturday included Colvin and
Doub at the ends, familiar as mem
bers of last year's team, and Grey
and Kite, also members of the 1931
squad.
