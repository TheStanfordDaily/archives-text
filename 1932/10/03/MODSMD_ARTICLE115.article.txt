# NEW YORK TAKES FOURTH STRAIT BALL GAME 13-6
## Lazzeri, Combs, Sewell Are Big Factors In Final Crushing Victory 
### 
Putting the finishing touches on
the slaughter which they started in
New York and which they continued
in Chicago, the New York Yankees
yesterday blasted out a 13-6 victory
over the already-crushed Chicago
Cubs to win the mythical world's
baseball championship in as awe
some a series as has ever been
played.
Where the bats of the mighty Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig had blasted
the Cub ramparts to bits on Satur
day, the war clubs of "Push-em-up"
Tony Lazzeri, Billy Dickey, Earl
Combs, and Joie Sewell put the
Cubs to rout yesterday.
After trailing 4-1 in the first, and
4-3 in the third, the Yanks jumped
into a temporary lead, 5-4, in the
fourth, saw the score tied in the
sixth, broke out in the seventh with
a four-run splurge that would have
won the ball game, and then polished
this off in the ninth with another
four-run rally that sent 50,000
astounded fans back to the environs
of Chicago with visions of the most
powerful machine that Wrigley Field
has ever had the misfortune to view.
Out of four defeats which the New
Yorkers handed the Cubsâ€”l 2-6, 5-2,
7-5, and 13-6, the work of the entire
Knickerbocker team stands pre
dominant, but the individual playing
of Gehrig leads, and the showman
ship of Ruth is remembered.
The Great One, still baseball's out
standing character at an age when
most baseball players are through,
is blasting them high, wide and
handsome. With Columbia Lou he is
the toughest, longest hitter in base
ball today. And his only weakness
is a walk!
To say that the world series was
a disappointment is to invite criti
cism from all angles. But when a
steamroller hits a flivver, the cheers
are all for the flivver. Chicago had
a fine team. They could hit. They
could field. Their pitchers would
have been great in any other com
pany. But they rAet a team with
out a single weakness. They met a
team that had power to burn and
when it put on steam there was just
no stopping it. And the Yankees are
far from being old men. They are
young men aged with experience,
and they were just unstopable.
