# Football Team "Dyes" For Dear Old Fordyce

FORDYCE, Ark., Oct. 2. (JP)
There's not a player on the Fordyce
High School football team who
would not "dye" for dear old For
dyce.
Every player on the squad, even
to the water boy, has dyed his hair
a flaming red in a wave of school
ardor to be distinctive and live up
to the name of the athletic teams â€”
"The Red Bugs."
Traveling grocery stores, mounted
on automobile trucks, have made
their appearance in Berlin.
