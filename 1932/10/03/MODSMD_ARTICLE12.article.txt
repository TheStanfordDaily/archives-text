## Dr. Julius Curtius, Former German Minister, To Address Assembly 
### 
Dr. Julius Curtius, former German
Minister of Foreign Affairs, will dis
cuss the reparations problem at a
University Assembly to be held
Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall. Eleven o'clock
classes will be dismissed so that all
students may attend the lecture.
As Minister of Foreign Affairs in
Germany during perhaps the most
crucial years in that country's his
tory, Dr. Curtius is peculiarly fitted
to interpret accurately the problems
which Germany faces today, and to
act as a commentator on current
European affairs.
Planned Customs Union
It was Dr. Curtius who, in colla
boration with the Austrian Foreign
Minister, Dr. Schober, formulated
the proposed Customs Union be
tween Germany and Austria as a
means to combat the tightening grip
of the depression in Central Europe.
This plan was ruled illegal by the
World Court.
In the fall of 1931 Dr. Curtius re
tired from office. He is accompanied
on his trip to the United States by
his wife and his son, Klaus.
Founded Political Party
Born in Duisburg on the Rhine,
Dr. Curtius attended a gymnasium
in his native town, and completed
his formal education at the Univer
sities of Strassburg, Kiel, Bonn, and
Berlin.
At the outbreak of the World War
he abandoned his study of the initia
tive and referendum which he was
carrying on and became an officer in
the artillery until 1918. In 1919 he
founded the Badisch Branch of the
German People's Party, Dr. Strese
mann's party.
Became Foreign Minister
Dr. Curtis first came before the
eyes of the world when he negoti
ated with the Right Wing Party of
the German Parliament for the ac
ceptance of the Dawes Plan by the
German people in 1924.
In 1926 he was made Minister of
Economics by President von Hinden
burg, and in October, 1929, upon the
death of Dr. Stresemann, he was
appointed Minister of Foreign Af
fairs.
Again, as Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, he was called upon to secure
the acceptance of the Young Plan
by the German parliament. This he
succeeded in doing despite the op
position launched by the parties of
the "Right Wing" under the leader
ship of Dr. Hugenberg and Adolf
Hitler.

eyes of the world when he negoti

the German Parliament for the ac
ceptance of the Dawes Plan by the
German people in 1924.
