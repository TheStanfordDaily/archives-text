# Stanford Net Squad Strong
## New Stars Coming Up To Replace Five Aces 
### 
Despite the fact that Stanford has
lost five lettermen from last year's
tennis team, prospects for a Pacific
Coast Championship aggregation ap
pear good.
Lettermen who were lost through
graduation include Keith Gledhill,
last year's captain, Chuck Weesner,
Bob Forbes, Kelsey Petterson and
John Gordon.
' However, this year's squad, head
ed by Captain Joe Coughlin and in
cluding such stars as Chuck Otis,
Dan Ellis, Sammy Lee, Glenn Reed,
Hugh Butler, and others from last
year's freshman team, will make the
other conference teams hustle to
keep ahead of the Indians.
Stars in Shape
All of these players have been
keeping in excellent condition and
playing lots of tennis. Captain
Coughlin, paired with Gledhill, cap
tured the National Intercollegiate
Doubles title and will undoubtedly
be one of the hardest men to defeat
on the Pacific Coast.
Chuck Otis has been winning
tournaments all summer, including
the Pasadena Open Championship,
the Santa Monica Open Champion
ship, the San Gabriel Open Cham
pionship, and the Pintoresca Open
Championship.
Otis and Dan Ellis were also final
ists in several Southern California
tournaments.
Lee Makes Bid
Sammy Lee, captain of last year's
freshman team, who seems to be the
only member of that team that is
sure of a varsity position this year,
reached the quarter finals of the
National Junior championships in
the East this summer.
It is not known whether Jack
Cosgrove, a member of last year's
varsity, will be out for tennis this
year.
Hugh Butler and Glenn Reed will
be making a strong bid for positions
this year, although neither were on
last year's squad. They both play
consistent tennis and will be hard
men to get buy.
U.C.L.A. Dangerous
U.C.L.A., last year's conference
champions, again loom as the team
to beat to win the coveted cham
pionship. Although the Bruins have
lost Leonard Dwarkin, Captain El
bert Lewis, and Cliff Robbins, they
still have the services of Jack Tid
ball, Billy Doeg, and others includ
ing a member of last year's fresh
man team by the name of Briggs
who has been burning up the
Southern courts this summer.
California's prospects don't seem
to be much better than last year,
and U.S.C., although always hard to
beat, should fall before the cham
pionship onslaughts of U.C.L.A. and
Stanford.
