# SWIMMERS LOOK WEAKER; LOSS OF THREE ACES FELT
## Booth, Clapp, McKelvey Trio Missed; Wiget Team Mainstay 
### Dick Van Wagenen 
With most of his star swimmers
outside pulling against the cold
current of graduate life, Assistant
Coach Nort Thornton finds himself
endowed with a collection of ma
terial that is only good enough to
defend the Pacific Coast title.
Thornton frankly admits that
Stanford is almost certain to be out
of the national limelight this year,
with a repetition of last year's won
der team nearly an impossibility.
With the loss of Frank Booth,
John McKelvey, and Austin Clapp,
every one of whom is a national
figure, Thornton will have to build
this season's tankmen around the
beefy form of Ted Wiget, national
quartermile champion.
Captain Tuppy Gardner, ace in the
100-yard specialty, will not regis
ter this quarter because of illness,
but is expected to sign up at the
beginning of winter quarter in time
to lead his team against any chal
lenger. Given enough time, Gardner
should be in shape to defend his
Pacific Coast title in creditable style.
Despite the temporary loss of
Gardner, Coach Thornton is blessed
with a wealth of sprinters, who will
splash in each other's faces for team
honors. No less than eight men have
turned out who can swim 56 sec
onds or better in the hundred
Gordy Graves, Dick Hirsch, Carl
von Saltza, Walter Doyle, Vlad Tara
nik, and Jim DeLamater, beside
Wiget and Gardner.
Graves and von Saltza were on
last year's varsity, Doyle and DeLa
mater were last year awaiting their
eligibility under the no-competition
the-first-year rule, and Hirsch and
Taranik were members of the fresh
man outfit.
In the distances, Wiget, Jimmy
Triolo, Vlad Taranik, George
Schmidt, Robert Raven, George Fry,
Walter Doyle, Jim Delamater, and
Leo Cook are the prospects. None
of them, with the possible exception
of Wiget, is expected to attain the
stardom of a Booth or a Clapp, how
ever.
Bob Clark heads the list of breast
strokers and, though he showed only
Pacific Coast championship caliber
last year, stands a chance of becom
ing a national figure if he gets down
to a lot of hard work and training.
Ray Wilbur, Jimmy Benet, Doug
Olds, and Sandy McGavern are his
chief competitors.
Back-strokers feel the loss of Bill
Rogers very deeply. Rogers enrolled
at the University of Arizona after a
ye<ir of freshman competition here.
Last season he was second only to
event. With Tebbetts back this
event. With Tebbettts back this
year, Stanford has a chance for the
coast championship in this evenc,
since the Indian backstroke star
came within inches of winning the
title last year. Barring a repetition
of last year's injury, Tebbetts should
be in fine form by the time the
season rolls around. Merrill Collette,
a new man developed during the
summer by Thornton, will furnish
competition for Tebbetts.
Diving will be taken care of this
year by Bob Wardwell, from last
season's varsity, and Milt Friedman
and George Fuller, both sophomores.
Frank Shallenberger, eligible this
year, and John Bennett are further
possibilities.
Regular time trials will be held
this quarter, beginning in about
three weeks, at which times the
members of both varsity and fresh
man outfits will have a chance to
show themselves off.
