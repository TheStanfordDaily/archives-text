# "DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY" TO BE PRODUCED
## Helvenston Will Conduct First Tryouts Tonight For Play Cast 
### 
Harold Helvenston, Director of
Stanford Dramatics, announces that
he has obtained rights to "Death
Takes a Holiday," by Alberto Cas
ella, a play which found great favor
when produced on Broadway during
the 1929-30 season. It is to be the
first Dramatic Council production of
the fall quarter.
Preliminary tryouts are to be held
for the play in the Assembly Hall
this evening at 7:15 o'clock. Further
tryouts are scheduled for Tuesday
evening at the same hour in the
Little Theatre. Helvenston plans
final casting and a first rehearsal on
Wednesday evening. All students —
except freshman women—are in
vited to try for roles.
Thirteen in Cast
The play is a fantasy with much
the atmosphere of "Berkeley Square"
which was received enthusiastically
by campus audiences when produced
here last year. There are thirteen
parts, six women and seven men,
each nicely differentiated.
Set in one physical scene, the ac
tion of the play lasts for three days,
the period between All Saints and
All Souls Day when the occult is
said to be close upon humans.
Drama Is Mystery
The air of the play is one of
mystery. It is a romantic tale, un
usual and interesting. A mysterious
and melancholy, even forbidding
Prince Sirki comes to Duke Lam
bert's Italian castle seeking human
emotions and finally discovers them,
with the aid of Grazia, the Duke's
niece.
Sensitive playing is demanded of
the actor who plays Sirki if the at
mosphere so necessary to the play is
to be maintained. Helvenston hopes
to bring together a cast which can
handle the careful shadings
