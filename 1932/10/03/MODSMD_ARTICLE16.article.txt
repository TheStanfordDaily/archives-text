# Crooks Find Barnum Right Encina Frosh Prove Easy Victims Of Rush Given Ride By 'Engineer'

Take it from any Frosh: A col
lege man's greatest need is sales
resistance.
An army of upper classmen stalks
the halls of Encina, ready to sell
anything from orange juice to Au
burn automobiles to unwary fresh
men.
The hordes of future butter-and
eggers, samples in hand, wear down
frosh resistance almost as rapidly as
they wear down door sills and check
books. A green-as-grass first year
man from Prune Center, lowa, buys
a shirt from the representative of
the Whoozis Manufacturing Com
pany because "all the seniors are
wearing this brand," only to have
the next salesman sell him the prod
uct of the Whatzis Shirt Corporation
because "Ernie Nevers always wears
this kind."
Pop Warner would have to have
half a. dozen heads, instead of just
half a dozen brains, in order to wear
all the different types of hats that
are supposed to be his favorite, ac
cording to the salesmen who knock

on freshmen doors and break up the
day-dreams about winning the Cal
game with a 90-yard run and one
minute to play.
The freshmen of an even less
sophisticated class of some time ago
were burrowing into their retreat
at Encina one cold evening in the
late fall. Coincident with the chill
there appeared an upper classman
dressed in greasy overalls and a
cap on which was emblazoned the
words "Radiator Engineer."
Bristling, with pipe wrenches and
other strange plumbing devices, he
announced himself by the title on
his cap, and the fact that for $2 per
room he would go over the radiators
and guarantee plenty of heat for the
winter. The gullible frosh fell for
the scheme, watched him hammer
and bang on radiators and sent him
away laden with cqin of the realm.
More tales could be told, but first
we must take care of the line of
frosh outside who are clamoring to
put down the first installment on a
Daily typewriter.
