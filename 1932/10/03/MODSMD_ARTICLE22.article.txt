# Life Of Assembly Speaker Reveals Many Sidelights
## Dr. Curtius, Andre Tardieu Were Schoolmates 
### 
In a statement received from Dr.
Robert E. Swain, several interesting
sidelights on the life of Dr. Julius
Curtius, speaker at the Assembly,
Wednesday morning, were disclosed.
He cited a curious discovery that
was made during a conference at
The Hague concerning the Young
Plan. Monsieur Tardieu, former
French Prime Minister, and Dr. Cur
tius were chatting together one day
when it was discovered that they
both had graduated with the rank
of primus omnium from their re
spective schools. They also discov
ered that they had studied at the
University of Bonn at the same time.
The distinguished lecturer was
born in Duisburg on the Rhine, his
family having been residents there
for more than a hundred years. He
was graduated from a gymnasium in
his native town with the rank of
primus omnium and began life as a
lawyer there, moving later to
Heidelberg. During these years, he
devoted his spare time to the study
of constitutional law, history, and
political economy, thus laying a
sound foundation for his subsequent
public services. His interest in ge
ology led him to gather a miner
ological collection which he still en
joys in his spare time. His other
hobbies are hiking, hunting and
swimming.
Dr. Curtius is peculiarly fitted to
discuss the Reparation Question, to
interpret accurately the problems
which Germany faces today, and to
act as a commentator on current
European affairs because of his po
sition as Minister of Foreign Affairs
; in Germany during perhaps the most
| crucial years in German History.
