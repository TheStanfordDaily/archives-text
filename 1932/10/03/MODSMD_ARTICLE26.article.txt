Greek letter fraternities are hurry
ing to get their "ten men" classes
ready for the final pledging to take
place at the lawyer's office in the
Union between 1 and 4 o'clock on
October 5.
With open rushing the rule for
this delayed period for the men of
'35, the general uncertainty and air
of tenseness, so typical of pledging
"week, has been greatly increased.
Details Discussed

cards for final pledging will be ex
plained and other business discussed

spring:
1. The lawyer's office shall be open
from 1 to 4 o'clock on the afternoon

2. Fraternities shall send in not
in excess of ten bids to the lawyer
before the appointed hour.
3. Houses may pledge members of

understanding in regards to the
number of men that may be pledged
from the Class of 1935 while they
