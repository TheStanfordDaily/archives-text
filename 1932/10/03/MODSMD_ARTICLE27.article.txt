# Classes Vie In Mud Thursday
## 
### 
Suppressed desires for mudsling
ing will find enthusiastic expression
Thursday afternoon when frosh and
soph tangle, twist, and ooze in the
traditional interclass mud fight.
With the Class of '36 outnumber
ing the sophomore hosts by a mar
gin of 150, Ralph Staver, sophomore
president, is relying upon clever
strategy and intensive organization
to overwhelm the lower-classmen.
Last night Staver made bold to
say: "We are out to crush every last
pne of the so-called 'men' of En
cina. Frosh, here's mud in your
eyes!"
Freshmen were equally pugna
cious and optimistic. With their band
of 450, they expect to finish the 300
sophs long before the half-hour al
lotted for the struggle.
When the contest begins at 3
o'clock, referees will be on hand to
enforce Stanford's constitutional re
strictions on rough handling.
