# A 						MESS THAT MAY PROVE A BLESSING
## 
### 
The manner in which the solution of the rushing tangle
of last spring is working out justifies the prediction of the
most pessimistic. Intended to penalize the most flagrant of
rules violators, postponement of pledging has in fact
worked a severe hardship on the class of 1935 and on the
fraternities less daring in rules breaking last year, while it
has protected the most guilty.
With the exception of summer rushing, which is at best
a haphazard operation, houses that engaged in compara
tively little illegal rushing last year have had virtually no
opportunity to catch up to the chief offenders in the matter
oi contacting men eligible for pledging Wednesday.
Sophomores find themselves in a quandary regarding
living quarters. For those who have definitely decided upon
the fraternity of their choice, all is well. But for the men
who are still uncertain, who are not yet sure they wish to
pledge a fraternity, and who may be living in a house in
which they are not sure they want to stay, all is far from
well. Perhaps they will not he hid. Perhaps they may de
cide that the house in which they are living is not, after all,
the one they want to pledge. Whatever happens it is a
cinch that many men in the class of 1935 will, after Wednes
day, face the prospect of room hunting on a campus that is
already room-hunted to death.
Responsibility for the mess cannot be laid on any par
ticular doorstep, and if it could, laying it there now would
not help. Not a little can be gained, however, by observing
the present muddle and 1 noting it as an example of what
not to get into.
The Interfraternity Board of Control failed to lead the
way for fraternities last year, acting not as an adviser or a
controller of fraternities, but as a policeman, waiting until
something went wrong before it acted. The fraternities, on
the other hand, went beyond all reasonable bounds in fla
grant, illegal rushing. And the men of 1935, though least
responsible, were equally daring in making themselves
available for rushing.
There is little doubt that the entire blowoff will eventu
ally prove a boon to the fraternity situation. Already it has
in increased consciousness on all sides that the
system as it has been operating the past few years is un
satisfactory. The Board of Control has already set up an
improved system for rushing the men in the class of 1936,
a system which may he even better perfected as the school
year progresses. And the fraternities, suffering through the
present rushing season, will undoubtedly decide that it is
to their best interests to co-operate with an Interfratniy
Board of Control that has assumed its rightful position as
leader and adviser of fraternities.
