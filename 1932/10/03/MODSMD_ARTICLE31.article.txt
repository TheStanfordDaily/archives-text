In the heart of every son of ambition who ever landed
on this sacred Cardinal soil has lain at one time or another
the ardent desire to be a whip, a big shot, a head hasher or
something else equally far above the plane of the society
back home. So this discourse might be termed "Keys to
Success" or "How Big Shots Are Made."
Traditions are paramount, respected and absorbed by
all successes, head hashers or no. Here at Stanford they
are 0.K., so snap not the fingers. There are just five:
There's smoking on the Quad—don't do it. Mrs. Stan
ford asked all of us not to a long time ago, when she gave
us this place, and so we promised. And the Honor Code.
Believe in it and be honorable. Students at other schools
are incredulous when we tell them how we trust each
other here. So keep up the good work.
Now no matter what kind of a car you drive (this is
serious), whether it be 1916 phaeton or 1934 convertible,
always stop at the "bumming place" down by the railroad
and pick up any of the gang who are standing there wait
ing for a ride.' And "Hello!" everybody you see, anywhere
and anytime . Even if he's your worst enemy, don't go past
him with your nose on the ground.
And lastly, remember you can't have cords till you
grow up. Two years at least, and if you poop out on the
professors they'll go you minus and it will take you three
years to get out of the Lower Division instead of two. Just
imagine three years of jeans and moleskins!
