### BABBITS IN CORDS 
Like a cantankerous maiden aunt,
the summer interlude has finally
been laid to rest. And some 3,000
collegians stampede back to the Ad
ministration Building to repeat all
the things they have complained
doing for the preceding three quar
ters. Even as w ego through the
ritual of grumbling at writing
"Stanford University" on the dotted
line, we can hardly conceal our
pleasure and relief at being back.
Everyone knows that being back
means eight o'clocks, arid lectures,
and puerile quizzes—yet everyone is
fairly ga-ga to be on the Farm once
more. If we were canines and had
tails, we would probably beat a
withering tattoo on our sides in
sheer joy.
All this exuberance—not because
we are thirsting to lap at the wells
of learning, not to catch the pearls
the faculty may be able to dribble
before us, but simply because vaca
tion has bored us stiffer than an oak
log. Those who defied economic
facts and Democratic orators, and
wangled a job, had something to do
The rest who attempted to pass time
by the show-dance—dance-show—
etc., etc., formula, found themselves
soggy pieces of flotsam or aimless
hunks of jetsam in two or three
weeks. The rest of the summer was
a monotonous trek through the
sands of boredom.
And all this, besides chronicling
the unhappy fate of the collegian
at-large, is damning proof that we
are nothing but so many Babbitt:

in cords and leather jackets (or
brown jumpers)—just marking time
until the day when the sacred stamp
of Rotary is placed upon us. We
josh the business man who keeps
the beagle on the grindstone until
the skin burns like tar paper. He
doesn't retire because he can't. And
when the undergraduate is forcibly
retired for three months, vacuous
disaster results.
With 57 different fields of diver
sion opened to us during a collegi
ate year, we are attacked with acute
ennui as soon" as we or our pocket
books tire of dancing. The Babbitt
is lashed along by the dollar mark.
The collegian has his professor to
apply the prod. Both are lost when
the exterior incentive is lacking.
That the' college student cannot va
cation for three months is pitiful.
That we can do nothing grace
fully, interestingly, and profitably is
a smashing indictment to those that
hoped to find a new race of men as
soon a§ everybody and his Aunt in
Bisbee were jammed in, through,
and out of college squads.
Most sad of all, however, is the
plight of the women students, parti
cularly those residing in the Cali
fornia hinterland, Oregon wilder
ness, or the outlands generally.
These social beetles miss the whirl
that 5 to 1 odds «on the Farm gave
them. Emancipated from knitting by
the new equality—and robbed of
incessant male companionship by lo
cal conditions—these orphans were
most severely battered in what to
them was the dead calm of vacation.
