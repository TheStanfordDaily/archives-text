THURSO'S LANDING. By Robin
son Jeffers. Liveright. 1932.
$2.50.
This long narrative poem Is the
tragedy of a woman who feared her
husband more than she loved him.
Helen, after an affair with Rick
Armstrong, is brought back by her
husband, Reave Thurso, who is
shortly after horribly crippled.
The struggle of Thurso against
the thought of suicide to end his
physical pain, the insanity of
Heave's brother, Mark, and the men
tal conflict of Helen with her fear,
love, and hatred of Thurso, fur
nish an intense emotional back
ground for .Joffers' philosophy.
A comparison of Jeffcrs with T. S.
Eliot displays Jeffers' characteris
tics. Both poets are involved with
the decay of personal conscious
ness. Their different views of the
problem anticipate their slightly
different solutions. Compare the fa
cetious yet sinister despair of Eliot:
I grow old ... I grow old
I shall wear the bottoms of my
trousers rolled,
with the triumphant despair of Jef
fers :
No imaginable
Human presence here could do
anything
But dilute the lonely self
watched passion.
The author of Prufrock is posi
tively horrified at the idea of Time
ruining a charming personality like
the author of Prufrock, while the
author of Thurso's Landing looks
forward with some enthusiasm to
the period when he shall become
comfortably silent. He is quite cer
tain that his brain will be just as
useful, and much more peaceful,
employed in cultivating a geranium
seed, as it is now in wrenching out
poems that few appreciate.
There is not another poet living
who can write free verse as well as
Jeffers. A complete knowledge of
word assonance and a skill at pack
ing the sensuous into stabbing
phrases enable him to compose lines
swinging with beauty and power.
It is unfortunate that such a su
perb technician should be so nar
rowed by his philosophy. Hart
Crane, upon finding the world an

t ineluctable mess, committed suicide,
i Jeffers has committed suicide for
! the same reason, but somehow
manages to keep on breathing and
continually re-echoing his death in
magnificent poetry.

INTERMISSION—At the Columbia
Theatre.
Here is farce of the 191 1 variety,
modernized only by a few warm
references to sex, but moderately
amusing for all that. The charac
ters, are tremendously unseeing for
the author's purpose that he may, at
the finale, cast a mighty light about
| the stage and have denouement
i tumbling about everyone's cars.
! Unlike the sentimental play too
i frequently called comedy only be
| cause at the final curtain two per
| sons stand arm in arm before a
j painted view of aris rooftops, this
is true farce. Its situation is ridicu
lous and it never lapses into an
attempt to jerk tears.
Glen Tryon and Madge Bellamy
are good; Judith Voseili is wasted
in a colorless role, and Selmar
Jackson, made unusually unimagi
native by the author, might be less
restrained than he is, however aim
lessly debonair his lines make him.
The theatre crowd the action
takes place in the lobby of a thea
tre —is diverse and, in part, amus
ing, but contains several over
worked types and lots of aspiring
actors who try strenuously to he
nearest the footlights.
The last act is too long, the situ
ation being strained to make the
! act full length. It needs cutting.
