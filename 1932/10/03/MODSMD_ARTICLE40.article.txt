# HALL KITCHEN TINTED Mysterious Color Chosen HASHERS SEE GREEN
## 
### 
Discolored by nine years of
kitchen smoke and grease, chipped
and cracked by two generations of
hashers and busboys, the walls of
the kitchen at Encina Commons had
to be re-decorated, it was decided
earjy this summer. Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls, and
Mrs. Hilda Longyear Watson, as
sistant director, found funds avail
able for the work, but the real
problem lay in a choice of color.
A change was decided upon.
Everyone was tired of the vast ex
panses of yellowish-cream.
White? It shows dirt to easily pro
duces a glare. Choice was narrowed
to green and blue. Unadulterated,
both were too gay for a kitchen.
Experimentation was turned to.
Painters mixed blues, greens, whites
in various proportions.
Out of these efforts came a color
which was applied to the walls.
"Robin egg blue," "bluish green,"
"greenish white," "sky blue," and
just plain green are the names vari
ously applied to the finished job.
Some say it makes the kitchen
look as though the light were filtered
through fathoms of crystal-clear wa
ter; others claim the impression is
unmistakably one of a springtime
sky.
Everyone becomes rather annoyed
and starts to hedge when you ask for
the name of the color. It's satisfac
tory, unique, pleasing to the eye—
but nameless.
