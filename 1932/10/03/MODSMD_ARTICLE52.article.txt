# STANFORD DAILY TO CIRCULATE 'FREELY' AROUND COMMUNITY
## 
### 
All registered students will re
ceive the Stanford Daily, free of
charge, in the living groups on the
campus and at their homes in Palo
Alto. Persons who are not reg
istered, but who wish to take the
paper, may have it sent or delivered
for $1.50 a quarter or $4.00 a year.
Delivery begins immediately to
the men's dormitories, Roble and
the fraternities and sororities. The
Daily may also be obtained at the
corners of the Quad.
There will be delivery from house
to house during the whole year for
students living in Palo Alto. Distri
bution to off-campus students will
probably begin Tuesday.
