## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
The Phi Betes are losing their grip
on the scholastic bouquet.
Daily writers have nosed out
"Quad" and "Chaparral" scribblers
in the race for grade points.
This and more of its kind is re
vealed in the report of the Com
mittee on Scholarship incorporated
in the Annual Report of the Presi
dent for the academic year 1931-
1932. The report tabulates scholastic
standings of living groups and other
Campus organizations on the basis
of the average number of grade
points to registered units. The all-
Campus average number of grade
points to registered units. Campus
average is 0, the rating for women
being +2 and the rating for men —l.
In 1929-1930 the Phi Betes led
Phi Lambda Upsilon, honorary
chemistry fraternity, by two units,
topping the entire list* with a rating
of +7. The succeeding year Phi
Lambda Upsilon tied with them for

the honors. Last yeaij Phi Bete
stock dropped to -f'G, and Phi
Lambda Upsilon remained steady at
+7.
Rating of the Daily staff, which
has been below that of the Quad
and Chaparral in the past three
years, downed both its journalistic
brothers during the past year with
a score of 2 against a +1 for the
year book and a —1 for "Chaparral."
Most scholarly of Stanford's ath
letes were members of the varsity
track squad and the Freshmen tennis
team. They averaged +l.
Alpha Kappa Lambda, consistent
leader of the Row in scholastic af
fairs, rose to new glory with the
achievement of a rating of +3. Two
years ago they triumphed with a
-f1 score.
A room in Branner is the best bet
for the undergraduate hall man who
would fight for distinction in the
pages of the bawlout.
