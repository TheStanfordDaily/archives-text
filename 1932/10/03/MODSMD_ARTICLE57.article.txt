# Education Department Has Large Enrolment
## 
### 
The enrollment of education ma
jors will nearly equal that of last
fall, according to the present figures.
Seventy-three students had signed
up last Saturday night, only ten less
than the total for the first day last
year.
Many of the prospective teachers
had not yet completed their registra
tion and will enter later, according
to Miss Dorothy Putnam, depart
ment secretary.
