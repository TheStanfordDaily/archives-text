# Men's Council To Inform '36 Men On Code
## Violations Of Honor Code Fewer Last Year 
### 
Planning to continue the 1931 in- j
novation of freshman meetings to
describe and discuss the Honor Code,
the Men's Council expects to
strengthen adhesion to the Code still |
more at Stanford during the com- j
ing year. At a meeting held last i
spring, the Council formulated ten
tative plans that call for the instruc
tion of small groups of first-year
men in their responsibility toward j
the Code. This scheme, as operated |
last year under the leadership of j
Milton Hand, proved extremely sue- j
cessful.
The present Council, which in- i
eludes Chairman Gordon Campbell, j
John Huneke, Gilbert Carr, Bill I
Mearns, and Tom Campbell, hopes j
to receive co-operation from the j
freshmen similar to that obtained j
from the class of 1935. Last year, j
the freshmen became so interested I
in the success of the Code that they j
formed their own Freshman Honor
Council.
Freshmen Had Council
This group of seven men had com
plete chargfe of all freshman viola
tors of the Code. Yearling en
thusiasm for the Code was so great
that it was found necessary to dis
cipline but two or three offenders,
and these received a warning against
repetition of the offense.
Last spring, uniform rules for
Honor Code violators were drawn
up by the Men's Council and these 1
will probably be in effect this year, j
They call for three quarters suspen- |
sion for a first offense and expulsion i
for a second. The Honor Code itself j
simply specifies that a student is j
on his own honor not to cheat during j
examinations.
Three Suspended
In accordance with these new |
rules, three cases were handled last
spring after the Daily ceased publi
cation. The Men's Council suspended
three Honor Code violators each for
three quarters. Two of these vio
lations occurred in the Military Sci
ence Department.
