# THE 						REVIEWER 1932 SUMMER SEASON
## 
### A. D 
THE SUMMER SEASON: I—Stan
ford.
Frederick Stover, technical direc
tor and acting stage director, began
his summer program with a new
comedy called "Parade." The play,
by a Yale graduate, Elaine Ryan
Wallace, has an intrinsically satiric
theme which in the hands ot a
George Kaufman might have been
extremely funny. Mrs. \\ allace,
however, sentimentalized her idea
and, for the purpose of contrasting
"frames," built two supernumer
ary characters into leads, thereby
diverting attention unfortunately
from the large - headed Olympics
hero and badly confusing her pur
pose. Sentiment overcame satire
and a sweet little old lady ran oil
with the show.
The second production was of Su
san Glaspell's hopelessly sentimen
tal "Alison's House," which, while
it reads pleasantly enough, becomes
in production merely a long repe
tition of the name "Alison" and a
series of suppressed sobs.
While both of the summer plays
§howed too many of the bad effects
of female playwriting, the produc
tions themselves were excellent
Fred Stover, comparatively inexpe
rienced as a director, handled botl
the constant -chatter and crowds o
the first play and the quiet melan
clioly of the second equally well
He deserves much commendatioi
for this skill, and for his fine set
tings.
Sword and Sandals and the Eng
lish Club sponsored a series of sum
mer readings. The first, Milne's con
sistently arid almost bitterly satiri<
"Truth About Bladys" was follower
by Noel Coward's "Home Chat." Th<
third, Congreve's brilliant "Way o
the World," was an experiment ii
the reading of an older play. Heac
broadly in the more raucous scenes
it was, if not entirely successful ii
escaping occasional lethargy, inter
esting.
Of the summer's actors, Bill Main
and Myna Hughes in "Parade" wen
outstanding. In "Alison's House'
Irving Rosenblatt, Joseph Wolf, ant
Nancy Roberts gave sincere am
careful performances, but Charle:
Beardsley--later a bad Mirabell—
ran off with the honors in a coined:
role which might easily have beei
bad.
Marian Jones, hitherto relegater
to the serving of tea, was remark
able, as Janet Ebony in "Home Chat'
and a charming Millamant in "Tin
Way of the World." Robert Brauns
Ruth Evans, and Joseph Wolf die
the best work in "Bladys." Will
Williams and Waldo Salt- I)r. Mar
■ gery Bailey ably assisting as Lad:
.Wishfort —were good in the lasi
reading.
THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—Pair
Alto.
After a number of execrable per
formances chieily ot worthies:
one-act plays—the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre modified its pro
gram and raised its standard of pro
duction somewhat.
The organization's first summci
production was "Remote Control,'
a bad mystery play with some re
deeming comedy, most of whicl
found happy interpretation at the
hands of Waldo Salt, as a wise
cracking radio technician. The per
formance was not notable bui
showed some progress above tlu
hurriedly produced weekly bills of
one-acters.
Next came * c The Makropoulos Se
cret," awkwardly built but an ex
cellent vehicle for acting. Helen
Campen was fine as Emelia Mart:
and again Waldo Salt, in a tptallv
different role, showed himself ca
pable. Sydney Head, with keen use
of makeup, costume, and voice,
made a colorless role actual. Wil
liam Radcliffe, as Prus, was the
weakest member of the cast in a
part which should have been ex
tremely strong.
Gordon Davis, in town for the
summer, did two plays. The first,
"She Got AVvay with It," by Elene
Wilbur and Professor Henry Dayid
Gray, was comparatively unamusing
small-town stuff. It may find favoi
with Henry Duffy's audiences but
can hardly expect to last on Broad
way. Elizabeth Wilbur came up
from Hollywood to play the leading
role and expended a tremendous
amount of energy over it.

Davis revived "Aren't We All" as
his second production. The play is
one of that series which has a sweet
old rake as the leading character
and what I saw of it was unim
pressive. Davis and Adelaide Kelly
took the honors. Fred Stover made
much of a small part.
Harold Helvenstoh, recovered
from burns received while he was
experimenting with powder at the
Bohemian Grove Play, produced
"Private Graveyard," written in col
laboration with George Hinkle.
It lacked action, the essential of
drama. There was a great deal ot
debating art versus science but that
bel«mgs on a rostrum, not behind
footlights. There were several very
good scenes, but .in its own way.
and with its own purpose to por
tray small-town gossips—"She Got
Away with It" more nearly accom
plished its purpose than did "Pri
vate Graveyard."
The play is not Broadway, mate
rial at present; if the debate is
eliminated and the dialogue bright
ened where it lags it will have bet
ter chances. At the Guild an in
genious first act scheme of move
ment was found impracticable by
Helvenston and the act appeared t<
be less effective than it really is.
The settings were attractive am
the cast fair; Paul Speegle and Free
Stover were most consistently amus
ing.
THE SUMMER SEASON: lll—Sai
Francisco.
The summer season in San Fran
cisco was as thin as the loca
scene was crowded —but somewhat
better. At the end of spring quartei
j Katherine Cornell was at the Cur
ran with her excpiisite productior
of "The Barretts of Wimpole Street'
and Channing Pollock's lamentable
"House Beautiful," produced by a
contrite Henry Duffy, was playint
to an empty Alcazar.
Soon thereafter appeared Arthui
Greville Collins' production of "Ber
keley Square" (Columbia) whirl
demonstrated beyond any doubt tlu
! superiority of some Stanford pro
| ductions over West Coast tourine
j companies.
Collins' production was in even
respect inferior to that of Helven
ston 011 the Campus last fall. The
company was poor, the direction ab
solutely without imagination ane
without a trace of the ethereal qual
ity so absolutely essential to make
the play, even for a short time, be
lievable. The settings were bael ane
the lighting crude. It was an un
fortunate anel dull affair —but a val
uable lessem in comparative values
which followed happily, close upor
the heels of some unintelligent loca
editorial misapprehension.
The Columbia remained elarl
from July 3 until September 26
when a new play, "Intermission,'
appeared. A review of this shov
appears elsewhere in today's paper
At the Geary the overcried "Whis
tling in the Dark," even with the
allegedly stimulating Ernest Truex
lasted only a week. It was followec
by a finely acted production oi
"Cynara" with Philip Merivale, Sii
Guy Standing, and Phoebe Foster
The play itself was a keen study oi
female possessiveness made actua
by the acting of the Broadway com
pany which turned the apparently
offhand lines- into mere masks foi
feeling. The play was greeted en
thusiastically.
"Reunion in Vienna," Robert
Sherwood's amusing satire 011 tie
caying royalty, was mildly success
ful, lasting three weeks. Ina Claire
and Donald Brian, ably assisted by
William Stack —who, as usual, al
most displaced the stars —and Wal
ter Poulter were the chief per
formers.
The surprise of the summer wa:
the tremendous favor Jerome Kern's
I "Cat and the Fiddle" found. II

j Francisco. The score was pleasant.
! Helen Gahagan, the star, charming,
| and several light comedy scenes
S very amusing. But on the whole
! the production was too talky, sev
i eral scenes which should have been

fminutes. Another indication, this
production, that critical and public
j fancy may diverge.

A THRENODY FOR GOLON
DRINA. By Jadct Thanet. At the
Wayfarer's Theatre, 76 Commer
cial Street, San Francisco.
A long, dark stairway between
gloomy warehouses ... a dimly
lighted, tiny room, tapestry cover
ing its rough brick walls ... a
lilliputian stage . . . such is the
setting selected by the Wayfarers
for their experimental theatre.
The play was "A Threnody for
Golondrina," written by the direc
tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."

THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—Pair

After a number of execrable per
formances chieily ot worthies:
one-act plays—the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre modified its pro
gram and raised its standard of pro
duction somewhat.
The organization's first summci
production was "Remote Control,'
a bad mystery play with some re
deeming comedy, most of whicl
found happy interpretation at the
hands of Waldo Salt, as a wise
cracking radio technician. The per
formance was not notable bui
showed some progress above tlu
hurriedly produced weekly bills of
one-acters.
Next came * c The Makropoulos Se
cret," awkwardly built but an ex
cellent vehicle for acting. Helen
Campen was fine as Emelia Mart:
and again Waldo Salt, in a tptallv
different role, showed himself ca
pable. Sydney Head, with keen use
of makeup, costume, and voice,
made a colorless role actual. Wil
liam Radcliffe, as Prus, was the
weakest member of the cast in a
part which should have been ex
tremely strong.
Gordon Davis, in town for the
summer, did two plays. The first,
"She Got AVvay with It," by Elene
Wilbur and Professor Henry Dayid
Gray, was comparatively unamusing
small-town stuff. It may find favoi
with Henry Duffy's audiences but
can hardly expect to last on Broad
way. Elizabeth Wilbur came up
from Hollywood to play the leading
role and expended a tremendous
amount of energy over it.

Davis revived "Aren't We All" as
his second production. The play is
one of that series which has a sweet
old rake as the leading character
and what I saw of it was unim
pressive. Davis and Adelaide Kelly
took the honors. Fred Stover made
much of a small part.
Harold Helvenstoh, recovered
from burns received while he was
experimenting with powder at the
Bohemian Grove Play, produced
"Private Graveyard," written in col
laboration with George Hinkle.
It lacked action, the essential of
drama. There was a great deal ot
debating art versus science but that
bel«mgs on a rostrum, not behind
footlights. There were several very
good scenes, but .in its own way.

The play is not Broadway, mate

Helvenston and the act appeared t<

A THRENODY FOR GOLON
DRINA. By Jadct Thanet. At the
Wayfarer's Theatre, 76 Commer
cial Street, San Francisco.
A long, dark stairway between
gloomy warehouses ... a dimly
lighted, tiny room, tapestry cover
ing its rough brick walls ... a
lilliputian stage . . . such is the
setting selected by the Wayfarers
for their experimental theatre.
The play was "A Threnody for
Golondrina," written by the direc
tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."
THE SUMMER SEASON: I—Stan
ford.
Frederick Stover, technical direc
tor and acting stage director, began
his summer program with a new
comedy called "Parade." The play,
by a Yale graduate, Elaine Ryan
Wallace, has an intrinsically satiric
theme which in the hands ot a
George Kaufman might have been
extremely funny. Mrs. \\ allace,
however, sentimentalized her idea
and, for the purpose of contrasting
"frames," built two supernumer
ary characters into leads, thereby
diverting attention unfortunately
from the large - headed Olympics
hero and badly confusing her pur
pose. Sentiment overcame satire
and a sweet little old lady ran oil
with the show.
The second production was of Su
san Glaspell's hopelessly sentimen
tal "Alison's House," which, while
it reads pleasantly enough, becomes
in production merely a long repe
tition of the name "Alison" and a
series of suppressed sobs.
While both of the summer plays
§howed too many of the bad effects
of female playwriting, the produc
tions themselves were excellent
Fred Stover, comparatively inexpe
rienced as a director, handled botl
the constant -chatter and crowds o
the first play and the quiet melan
clioly of the second equally well
He deserves much commendatioi
for this skill, and for his fine set
tings.

can hardly expect to last on Broad

from Hollywood to play the leading
role and expended a tremendous
amount of energy over it.

Davis revived "Aren't We All" as
his second production. The play is
one of that series which has a sweet
old rake as the leading character

took the honors. Fred Stover made
much of a small part.
Harold Helvenstoh, recovered

Bohemian Grove Play, produced
"Private Graveyard," written in col

A THRENODY FOR GOLON
DRINA. By Jadct Thanet. At the
Wayfarer's Theatre, 76 Commer
cial Street, San Francisco.
A long, dark stairway between
gloomy warehouses ... a dimly
lighted, tiny room, tapestry cover
ing its rough brick walls ... a
lilliputian stage . . . such is the
setting selected by the Wayfarers
for their experimental theatre.
The play was "A Threnody for
Golondrina," written by the direc
tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."
THE SUMMER SEASON: I—Stan
ford.
Frederick Stover, technical direc
tor and acting stage director, began
his summer program with a new
comedy called "Parade." The play,
by a Yale graduate, Elaine Ryan
Wallace, has an intrinsically satiric
theme which in the hands ot a
George Kaufman might have been
extremely funny. Mrs. \\ allace,
however, sentimentalized her idea
and, for the purpose of contrasting
"frames," built two supernumer
ary characters into leads, thereby
diverting attention unfortunately
from the large - headed Olympics
hero and badly confusing her pur
pose. Sentiment overcame satire
and a sweet little old lady ran oil
with the show.
The second production was of Su
san Glaspell's hopelessly sentimen
tal "Alison's House," which, while
it reads pleasantly enough, becomes
in production merely a long repe
tition of the name "Alison" and a
series of suppressed sobs.
While both of the summer plays
§howed too many of the bad effects
of female playwriting, the produc
tions themselves were excellent
Fred Stover, comparatively inexpe
rienced as a director, handled botl
the constant -chatter and crowds o
the first play and the quiet melan
clioly of the second equally well
He deserves much commendatioi
for this skill, and for his fine set
tings.
Sword and Sandals and the Eng
lish Club sponsored a series of sum
mer readings. The first, Milne's con
sistently arid almost bitterly satiri<
"Truth About Bladys" was follower
by Noel Coward's "Home Chat." Th<
third, Congreve's brilliant "Way o
the World," was an experiment ii
the reading of an older play. Heac
broadly in the more raucous scenes
it was, if not entirely successful ii
escaping occasional lethargy, inter
esting.
Of the summer's actors, Bill Main
and Myna Hughes in "Parade" wen
outstanding. In "Alison's House'
Irving Rosenblatt, Joseph Wolf, ant
Nancy Roberts gave sincere am
careful performances, but Charle:
Beardsley--later a bad Mirabell—
ran off with the honors in a coined:
role which might easily have beei
bad.
Marian Jones, hitherto relegater
to the serving of tea, was remark
able, as Janet Ebony in "Home Chat'
and a charming Millamant in "Tin

the best work in "Bladys." Will

A THRENODY FOR GOLON
DRINA. By Jadct Thanet. At the
Wayfarer's Theatre, 76 Commer
cial Street, San Francisco.
A long, dark stairway between
gloomy warehouses ... a dimly
lighted, tiny room, tapestry cover
ing its rough brick walls ... a
lilliputian stage . . . such is the
setting selected by the Wayfarers
for their experimental theatre.
The play was "A Threnody for
Golondrina," written by the direc
tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."
THE SUMMER SEASON: I—Stan
ford.
Frederick Stover, technical direc
tor and acting stage director, began
his summer program with a new
comedy called "Parade." The play,
by a Yale graduate, Elaine Ryan
Wallace, has an intrinsically satiric
theme which in the hands ot a
George Kaufman might have been
extremely funny. Mrs. \\ allace,
however, sentimentalized her idea
and, for the purpose of contrasting
"frames," built two supernumer
ary characters into leads, thereby
diverting attention unfortunately
from the large - headed Olympics
hero and badly confusing her pur
pose. Sentiment overcame satire
and a sweet little old lady ran oil
with the show.
The second production was of Su
san Glaspell's hopelessly sentimen
tal "Alison's House," which, while
it reads pleasantly enough, becomes
in production merely a long repe
tition of the name "Alison" and a
series of suppressed sobs.
While both of the summer plays
§howed too many of the bad effects
of female playwriting, the produc
tions themselves were excellent
Fred Stover, comparatively inexpe
rienced as a director, handled botl
the constant -chatter and crowds o
the first play and the quiet melan
clioly of the second equally well
He deserves much commendatioi
for this skill, and for his fine set
tings.
Sword and Sandals and the Eng
lish Club sponsored a series of sum
mer readings. The first, Milne's con
sistently arid almost bitterly satiri<
"Truth About Bladys" was follower
by Noel Coward's "Home Chat." Th<
third, Congreve's brilliant "Way o
the World," was an experiment ii
the reading of an older play. Heac
broadly in the more raucous scenes
it was, if not entirely successful ii
escaping occasional lethargy, inter
esting.
Of the summer's actors, Bill Main
and Myna Hughes in "Parade" wen
outstanding. In "Alison's House'
Irving Rosenblatt, Joseph Wolf, ant
Nancy Roberts gave sincere am
careful performances, but Charle:
Beardsley--later a bad Mirabell—
ran off with the honors in a coined:
role which might easily have beei
bad.
Marian Jones, hitherto relegater
to the serving of tea, was remark
able, as Janet Ebony in "Home Chat'
and a charming Millamant in "Tin
Way of the World." Robert Brauns
Ruth Evans, and Joseph Wolf die
the best work in "Bladys." Will
Williams and Waldo Salt- I)r. Mar
■ gery Bailey ably assisting as Lad:
.Wishfort —were good in the lasi
reading.
THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—Pair
Alto.
After a number of execrable per
formances chieily ot worthies:
one-act plays—the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre modified its pro
gram and raised its standard of pro
duction somewhat.
The organization's first summci
production was "Remote Control,'
a bad mystery play with some re
deeming comedy, most of whicl
found happy interpretation at the
hands of Waldo Salt, as a wise
cracking radio technician. The per
formance was not notable bui
showed some progress above tlu
hurriedly produced weekly bills of
one-acters.
Next came * c The Makropoulos Se
cret," awkwardly built but an ex
cellent vehicle for acting. Helen
Campen was fine as Emelia Mart:
and again Waldo Salt, in a tptallv
different role, showed himself ca
pable. Sydney Head, with keen use
of makeup, costume, and voice,
made a colorless role actual. Wil
liam Radcliffe, as Prus, was the
weakest member of the cast in a
part which should have been ex
tremely strong.
Gordon Davis, in town for the
summer, did two plays. The first,
"She Got AVvay with It," by Elene
Wilbur and Professor Henry Dayid
Gray, was comparatively unamusing
small-town stuff. It may find favoi
with Henry Duffy's audiences but
can hardly expect to last on Broad
way. Elizabeth Wilbur came up
from Hollywood to play the leading
role and expended a tremendous
amount of energy over it.

Davis revived "Aren't We All" as
his second production. The play is
one of that series which has a sweet
old rake as the leading character
and what I saw of it was unim
pressive. Davis and Adelaide Kelly
took the honors. Fred Stover made
much of a small part.
Harold Helvenstoh, recovered
from burns received while he was
experimenting with powder at the
Bohemian Grove Play, produced
"Private Graveyard," written in col
laboration with George Hinkle.
It lacked action, the essential of
drama. There was a great deal ot
debating art versus science but that
bel«mgs on a rostrum, not behind
footlights. There were several very
good scenes, but .in its own way.
and with its own purpose to por
tray small-town gossips—"She Got
Away with It" more nearly accom
plished its purpose than did "Pri

The play is not Broadway, mate
rial at present; if the debate is
eliminated and the dialogue bright
ened where it lags it will have bet

A THRENODY FOR GOLON
DRINA. By Jadct Thanet. At the
Wayfarer's Theatre, 76 Commer
cial Street, San Francisco.
A long, dark stairway between
gloomy warehouses ... a dimly
lighted, tiny room, tapestry cover
ing its rough brick walls ... a
lilliputian stage . . . such is the
setting selected by the Wayfarers
for their experimental theatre.
The play was "A Threnody for
Golondrina," written by the direc
tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."
THE SUMMER SEASON: I—Stan
ford.
Frederick Stover, technical direc
tor and acting stage director, began
his summer program with a new
comedy called "Parade." The play,
by a Yale graduate, Elaine Ryan
Wallace, has an intrinsically satiric
theme which in the hands ot a
George Kaufman might have been
extremely funny. Mrs. \\ allace,
however, sentimentalized her idea
and, for the purpose of contrasting
"frames," built two supernumer
ary characters into leads, thereby
diverting attention unfortunately
from the large - headed Olympics
hero and badly confusing her pur
pose. Sentiment overcame satire
and a sweet little old lady ran oil
with the show.
The second production was of Su
san Glaspell's hopelessly sentimen
tal "Alison's House," which, while
it reads pleasantly enough, becomes
in production merely a long repe
tition of the name "Alison" and a
series of suppressed sobs.
While both of the summer plays
§howed too many of the bad effects
of female playwriting, the produc
tions themselves were excellent
Fred Stover, comparatively inexpe
rienced as a director, handled botl
the constant -chatter and crowds o
the first play and the quiet melan
clioly of the second equally well
He deserves much commendatioi
for this skill, and for his fine set
tings.
Sword and Sandals and the Eng
lish Club sponsored a series of sum
mer readings. The first, Milne's con
sistently arid almost bitterly satiri<
"Truth About Bladys" was follower
by Noel Coward's "Home Chat." Th<
third, Congreve's brilliant "Way o
the World," was an experiment ii
the reading of an older play. Heac
broadly in the more raucous scenes
it was, if not entirely successful ii
escaping occasional lethargy, inter
esting.
Of the summer's actors, Bill Main
and Myna Hughes in "Parade" wen
outstanding. In "Alison's House'
Irving Rosenblatt, Joseph Wolf, ant
Nancy Roberts gave sincere am
careful performances, but Charle:
Beardsley--later a bad Mirabell—
ran off with the honors in a coined:
role which might easily have beei
bad.
Marian Jones, hitherto relegater
to the serving of tea, was remark
able, as Janet Ebony in "Home Chat'
and a charming Millamant in "Tin
Way of the World." Robert Brauns
Ruth Evans, and Joseph Wolf die
the best work in "Bladys." Will
Williams and Waldo Salt- I)r. Mar
■ gery Bailey ably assisting as Lad:
.Wishfort —were good in the lasi
reading.
THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—Pair
Alto.
After a number of execrable per
formances chieily ot worthies:
one-act plays—the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre modified its pro
gram and raised its standard of pro
duction somewhat.
The organization's first summci
production was "Remote Control,'
a bad mystery play with some re
deeming comedy, most of whicl
found happy interpretation at the
hands of Waldo Salt, as a wise
cracking radio technician. The per
formance was not notable bui
showed some progress above tlu
hurriedly produced weekly bills of
one-acters.
Next came * c The Makropoulos Se
cret," awkwardly built but an ex
cellent vehicle for acting. Helen
Campen was fine as Emelia Mart:
and again Waldo Salt, in a tptallv
different role, showed himself ca
pable. Sydney Head, with keen use
of makeup, costume, and voice,
made a colorless role actual. Wil
liam Radcliffe, as Prus, was the
weakest member of the cast in a
part which should have been ex
tremely strong.
Gordon Davis, in town for the
summer, did two plays. The first,
"She Got AVvay with It," by Elene
Wilbur and Professor Henry Dayid
Gray, was comparatively unamusing
small-town stuff. It may find favoi
with Henry Duffy's audiences but
can hardly expect to last on Broad
way. Elizabeth Wilbur came up
from Hollywood to play the leading
role and expended a tremendous
amount of energy over it.

Davis revived "Aren't We All" as
his second production. The play is
one of that series which has a sweet
old rake as the leading character
and what I saw of it was unim
pressive. Davis and Adelaide Kelly
took the honors. Fred Stover made
much of a small part.
Harold Helvenstoh, recovered
from burns received while he was
experimenting with powder at the
Bohemian Grove Play, produced
"Private Graveyard," written in col
laboration with George Hinkle.
It lacked action, the essential of
drama. There was a great deal ot
debating art versus science but that
bel«mgs on a rostrum, not behind
footlights. There were several very
good scenes, but .in its own way.
and with its own purpose to por
tray small-town gossips—"She Got
Away with It" more nearly accom
plished its purpose than did "Pri
vate Graveyard."
The play is not Broadway, mate
rial at present; if the debate is
eliminated and the dialogue bright
ened where it lags it will have bet
ter chances. At the Guild an in
genious first act scheme of move
ment was found impracticable by
Helvenston and the act appeared t<
be less effective than it really is.
The settings were attractive am
the cast fair; Paul Speegle and Free
Stover were most consistently amus
ing.
THE SUMMER SEASON: lll—Sai

The summer season in San Fran
cisco was as thin as the loca
scene was crowded —but somewhat
better. At the end of spring quartei
j Katherine Cornell was at the Cur
ran with her excpiisite productior
of "The Barretts of Wimpole Street'
and Channing Pollock's lamentable
"House Beautiful," produced by a
contrite Henry Duffy, was playint
to an empty Alcazar.
Soon thereafter appeared Arthui
Greville Collins' production of "Ber
keley Square" (Columbia) whirl
demonstrated beyond any doubt tlu
! superiority of some Stanford pro
| ductions over West Coast tourine
j companies.
Collins' production was in even
respect inferior to that of Helven
ston 011 the Campus last fall. The
company was poor, the direction ab
solutely without imagination ane
without a trace of the ethereal qual
ity so absolutely essential to make
the play, even for a short time, be
lievable. The settings were bael ane
the lighting crude. It was an un
fortunate anel dull affair —but a val
uable lessem in comparative values
which followed happily, close upor
the heels of some unintelligent loca
editorial misapprehension.
The Columbia remained elarl

tor, Jack Thomas. Clearly the au
thor has written just what he want
ed to write and let the public go
hang.
The result is unduly pessimistic
in its unfolding of the age-old story
of the struggle of a young couple
to escape a monotonous and miser
able existence in poverty; but in
spite of the fact that the tempo was
slow, the sincerity and enthusiasm
of the young people staging it saved
it from being dull. It showed really
skilful blending of grim realism
and fantastic symbolism.
The inescapable stiltedncss and
self - consciousness which always
distinguishes the amateur from tlie
professional was present throughout
the production; but there were sev
eral really noteworthy perform
ances, particularly those of Violet
I) up out as Golondrina and Patricia
Ivelley as her friend.
However, the honors should go to
Jerald Elwood who, in designing the
settings, did wonders with little
material and less space.
All in all, the Wayfarers offer a
most satisfying evening for those
playgoers who take their theatre
seriously and are tired of the nau
seatingly cut and dried sentiment
dished out in huge quantities by
the moguls of Hollywood and
Broadway under the label "enter
tainment."
