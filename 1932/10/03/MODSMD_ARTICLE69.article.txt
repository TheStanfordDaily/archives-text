### BRAVO, ENCINA 
The Editor, Sir:
As the tirst tomato slitliered its
way down the throats of the men
of '36, it stifled the groan of tra
ditional resentment in readiness to
slide out and fill the ghastly still
ness of Encina Commons.
The tomatoes did the trick. They
were somehow lacking in the his
toric Encina antiquity.
After four meals in campus din
ing halls, local freshmen are gas
tronomically content. Perhaps the
old order has at last indeed
changed. Perhaps the old adminis
tration standby—"Day by day in
every way Encina food grows bet
ter and better" is actually more
truth than Cooey.
At any rate, by and large, all
things considered — present frosh
diets are O.K.
STANFORD ! Pull - ese ! Don't
transform '36's optimists into bent
backed, sour-faced, disillusioned
freshmen! ;
