The Editor, Sir:
Now that a new quarter is begin
ning, I think the time proper for a
new demand for something in the
way of pulchritude among the 500.
For three years now, going on four,
I have wandered my weary way up
and down the Quad and the various
bypaths searching in vain for some
example of California's allegedly
beautiful women. I don't have to
tell you that I found about one a
quarter.
What is the reason for this con
dition? Other universities in the
West don't suffer from this lack of
charm. I refuse to believe that
beauty and brains are inseparably
divorced. And yet, what other rea
son can he advanced? If the admis
sion requirements for Stanford
women are so high as to bar all
good-looking women, then down
with the requirements, say I. We
must have better - looking women
around here. j ,
And now especially, with my sen

ior year drawing to a close, I feel
this need, to he imperative. Why
can't somebody in authority do
something about this. I don't want
to graduate with only a memory of
a lot of —well, with no memory of
beautiful women. Hoping you will
do something about this, I remain,
