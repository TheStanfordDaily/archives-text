time an increased burden is ex

The new bulletin, with comparisons
.between it and the old regulations,
follows:
New Rules
"The University does not main
tain an infirmary for the care of
students who are ill. The Student
Hospital Fund, which is financed by
the payment of $5.00 per quarter
by each student as part of the Com
munity Fee, provides limited finan
cial assistance to students needing
medical or surgical treatment at the
Palo Alto Hospital or at the Stan
ford University Hospitals in San
Francisco. It also defrays part of
the expenses of students housed at
the Rest Homes. Charges for calls
at a doctor's office, or for visits by
a doctor to a patient's home, must

the first week, and not more than
$1.50 toward the cost of each visit.
The fund will pay 25 per cent of
the charge for an emergency opera
tion, this amount not to exceed $25.
In operative cases students will not

"3. The Fund will pay during the
i first five days of hospitalization

"The foregoing charges are paid
i only in the event of a student's
j being admitted to the Palo Alto or

: Stanford University Hospitals on
the order of the Medical Adviser
of Men, the Medical Adviser of
Women, or of one of the local phy
sicians.
"The University cannot advise
students in regard to the choice of
a physician.
Aid in Rest Home
"REST HOMES —Under the fol
lowing regulations, the Student
Hospital Fund will be available for
the benefit of students in Rest
j Homes, who are temporarily in need
] of home conditions and home care,
; but who do not need hospitaliza
tion :
"1. The homes must he approved
as Rest Homes for men by the Med
! ical Adviser of Men, or as Rest
Hbmes for womeit by the Medical
Adviser of Women. [No change.]
"2. Admission of students to
such Rest Homes shall he with the
approval of the Director of the
Men Students' Health Service, .or of
the Medical Adviser of Women. [No
change.]
"3. The student on admission
shall designate a private physician
of choice so that no delay will oc
cur in the event that the service
of an attending physician is re
quired. [No change.]
"4. A rate of three dollars a day
shall he charged by the Rest Home,
with the understanding that the
Hospital FuntV will pay the entire
amount of the hill for the first five
days only, charging the student one
dollar a day for this period of resi
dence, hut that the Hospital Fund
i will extend no financial aid to the

student after the first live days.
[The old regulation read: . . Fund
will pay the entire amount of the
bill for the first seven days only,
charging the student qne dollar a
day for this period of residence,
but that the Hospital Fund extends
no financial aid to the student after
the first seven days."]
''s. If a physician is required
while the student is a patient in the
Rest Home, the Hospital Fund will
pay, on the approval of the Direc
tor of the Men Students' Health
Service or the Medical Adviser of
Women, the sum of $2. 00 toward the
total cost of the professional visits,
all charges in excess of $2.00 to he
paid by the student." [New para
graph.]
Since the majority of hospital and
rest home cases are of less than a
week's duration, the new regula
tions considerably benefit the ma
jority of students, while at the same
time they decrease but slightly the
aid extended students who must
undergo operations and remain in
the hospital for long periods of
time.
