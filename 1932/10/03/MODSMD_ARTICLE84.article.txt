## OREGON KNOCKS OVER BRONCOS IN CLOSE GAME Santa Clara Outclassed, Misses Only Chance To Score 
### 
The Santa Clara Broncos met
their superiors last Saturday when
they ran up against a bunch of Ore
gon Wehfoots and came home hold
ing the short end of a 7 to 0 score.
Too much Stan Kostka, 225-pound
Oregon halfback from Minnesota,
spelled defeat for the Broncos. Kost
ka made about as much yardage
himself as the entire Santa Clara
bickfiel.d.
But Santa Clara would probably
have lost even if Kostka had stayed
in Minnesota. The Broncos could
not penetrate the Webfoot -line as
they did so effectually against the
Bears a week ago. The Broncos kept
Joe Paglia busy all afternoon punt
ing out of danger.
The Santa Clarans had one excel
lent chance to score, but missed the
opportunity, when 011 the fourth
down a pass was completed beyond
the end zone. The crowd made up
almost entirely of Oregonians was
almost delirious as it thought that
the Broncos had scored. This op
portunity was afforded in the sec
ond half when the Broncs worked
the ball from their own side of the
50-yard line to the Oregon nine
yard stripe. It was the only sus
tained drive made by Santa Clara,
while the Webfooters trotted up and
down the field all afternoon miss
ing two chances to score.
The lone score of the game came
early in the first period. Kostka
packed the ball for 35 yards only to
sturhble and fall outside on the
Santa Clara nine-yard line. But
three plays later Kostka completed
the march to cross the goal line.

With the ball within Santa
Clara's l()-yard line at the end of
both the half and the game, the
Web looters were denied two almost
certain scores by the gun. The
Bronc attack was kept from show
ing any brilliance by an almost air
tight Wehfoot line. The Oregon
linemen broke through to shiear
many of the Satata Clara plays be
fore they got started.

With the ball within Santa
Clara's l()-yard line at the end of
both the half and the game, the
Web looters were denied two almost
certain scores by the gun. The
Bronc attack was kept from show
ing any brilliance by an almost air
tight Wehfoot line. The Oregon
linemen broke through to shiear
many of the Satata Clara plays be
fore they got started.
