# MAJOR UPSETS FEW AS NATION'S GRID TEAMS SWING INTO ACTION ONCE MORE
## 
### 
Major upsets were few and far
between as the first Saturday of Oc
tober brought all big teams on na

tional gridirons into action.
Santa Clara's Broncos suffered
the only serious casualty on the Pa

cific Coast when they fell before
University of Oregon, 7-0. The Weh
foots uncovered a new candidate for
All-American recognition in Stan
Kostka, 225-pound right halfback
from St. Paul, Minnesota.
Southern California was unim
pressive in winning from Washing
ton State, 20-0, the Trojans' three
touchdowns coming from two
blocked kicks and a prayer pass
thrown by Robert McNeish deep in
his own territory. Howard Jones
started a revised lineup, with Jor
gensen instead of Youell at center,
McNeish, subbing for Clemens at left
half, and .Bob Erskine, formerly a
tackle, replacing Gordon Clark at
right half.
St. Mary's, California, and Wash
ington employed superior reserve
strength to defeat Nevada, Olympic
Club, and Montana, but several up
sets were effected by minor teams.
U.S.C.'s freshmen were thumped to
the extent of 33-0 by Compton Jun
ior College, while La Verne surprised
Caltech, 19-0.
All Big Ten teams emerged un
scathed from their first real tests of
the season, although Marquette held
Wisconsin to a 7-2 score in a terrific
battle at Madison. But Marquette
has been trying to win from Wis
consin since the first LaFollette won
a Wisconsin election, so the five
points might as well have been fifty.
The first surprise of the Eastern
campaign came when little Bates
College battled Yale to a scoreless
tie, with Billy Pricher, a 19-year
old Bates halfback, in the starring
role. The usual early season trage
dies were numerous along the At
lantic seaboard: Fordham 69, Balti
more 0; Harvard 66, Buffalo 0; Syr
acuse 54, St. Lawrence 0, although
Hobart took it on tlie nose less se
verely than in former years in their
annual massacre by New York Uni
versity. The Violets won, 33-0. Niag
ara surprised by holding Cornell to
a single touchdown.
In China, if a man cannot pay his
debts his door is taken.

All Big Ten teams emerged un
scathed from their first real tests of
the season, although Marquette held
Wisconsin to a 7-2 score in a terrific
battle at Madison. But Marquette
has been trying to win from Wis
consin since the first LaFollette won
a Wisconsin election, so the five
points might as well have been fifty.
The first surprise of the Eastern
campaign came when little Bates
College battled Yale to a scoreless
tie, with Billy Pricher, a 19-year
old Bates halfback, in the starring
role. The usual early season trage
dies were numerous along the At
lantic seaboard: Fordham 69, Balti
more 0; Harvard 66, Buffalo 0; Syr
acuse 54, St. Lawrence 0, although
Hobart took it on tlie nose less se
verely than in former years in their
annual massacre by New York Uni
versity. The Violets won, 33-0. Niag
ara surprised by holding Cornell to
a single touchdown.
In China, if a man cannot pay his
debts his door is taken.
Major upsets were few and far
between as the first Saturday of Oc
tober brought all big teams on na

tional gridirons into action.
Santa Clara's Broncos suffered
the only serious casualty on the Pa

cific Coast when they fell before
University of Oregon, 7-0. The Weh
foots uncovered a new candidate for
All-American recognition in Stan
Kostka, 225-pound right halfback
from St. Paul, Minnesota.
Southern California was unim
pressive in winning from Washing
ton State, 20-0, the Trojans' three
touchdowns coming from two
blocked kicks and a prayer pass
thrown by Robert McNeish deep in
his own territory. Howard Jones
started a revised lineup, with Jor
gensen instead of Youell at center,
McNeish, subbing for Clemens at left
half, and .Bob Erskine, formerly a
tackle, replacing Gordon Clark at
right half.
St. Mary's, California, and Wash
ington employed superior reserve
strength to defeat Nevada, Olympic
Club, and Montana, but several up
sets were effected by minor teams.
U.S.C.'s freshmen were thumped to
the extent of 33-0 by Compton Jun
ior College, while La Verne surprised
Caltech, 19-0.
