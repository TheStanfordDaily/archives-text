# Oregon State Outfit 27-0
## Indian's Flashy Attack Baffles Beaver Gridmen Warner's Backfield Men Dazzle Portland Fans With Intricate Reverses, Short Passes, Trick Plays; Caddel, Hillman, Sim Outstanding 
### BOB WADE 
FOUR touchdowns in four quarters, three of them through the line, and
the fourth on an intercepted pass! The best showing for so early in the
season that a Stanford team has made within the memory of even the
hot-stove league. It wasn't a game that Stanford's white-shirted Indians
were playing with the Oregon State Beavers; it was a lesson in football
that the fast clever boy handed to the big, clumsy behemoth. But the
boys from Corvallis just couldn't solve the Indians' bewildering array of
spinners, reverses, double-reverses, and short passes that made the

Beavers tackle three successive men
only to find that a guard had it on
the other side of the line.
Stanford kicked off to Oregon
State, took the ball away from them
before they had a chance to get a
good look at it, marched fifty-four
yards in thirteen plays and had the
score 7-0 before the game was five
minutes old, as Caddel dented
Beaver ground for the first score
and Bill'Corbus kicked goal.
Indians Punch Line
Having given notice that class had
started, the Indian instructed a be
wildered but eager bunch of over
grown boys in the gentle art of pig
skin deception. Whtn the big boy
continued to play rough the Redskin
marched another fifty-four yards in
the second period and scored in
seven plays. Corbus kicked goal
again. Tex Walker, brother of the
famous Ed Walker, made the tally
on a nice sweep around end.
The third period brought a lum
bering ,but still bewildered Beaver
within Stanford's thirty-yard stripe
as Moe intercepted Jack Hillman's
pass and raced to the twenty-six.
But Biancone tried to pass and Hill
man returned the compliment and
the intercepted ball fifteen yards.
Sim Scores
Jump to the fourth period and
Caddel was still smashing inside
end, Hillman battering center, and
Bob Sim, blond newcomer from
Sacramento, racing around end on
long sweeps and darting off tackle
for five or ten yards at a crack.
And then the teacher was satis
fied to let the lesson sink in, only to
have Oregon's Franklin fire a pass
straight at Bob Sim when there was
no one within yards of him. So the
score rose and stopped at 27-0 in
stead of 20-0 as Corbus rang the
conversion bell for the third time.
Hillman Fast
This boy Hillman! Big, fast, ag
gressive, surpassing his brother in
everything but experience already.
He hands the ball to the halves with
perfect timing, and then just when
the defensive line dives for a half,
he spins through center for a first
down.
Ernie Caddel, playing his last sea
son for the Stanford Indian, is a
vastly improved player. He's faster.
He passes more accurately. His
kicks are longer and higher. He's a
better defensive player, and he's
playing football every minute that
he is on the field. When Warner
gets his best line picked and func
tioning there is nothing that can
stop Big Ernie.
Halfbacks Good
Warner has halves, lots of them.
Oregon State, with a continuous
stream of substitutes, saw more
halves than it could count. Maentz,
Afflerbaugh, Van Dellen (watch
him!), Sim, Caddel. They are all
fast, they are all shifty, and they
are all good defensive players.
Oregon State was primed for
Stanford's passes, and Stanford
scored three times through the line
on sheer power. Oregon State un
loosed a passing attack that made

things cloudy, and Stanford stopped
it cold.
'32 Team Better
It may not be the greatest team
in history. It may not win the con
ference. But it's going to be a team
that will make the rest of the con
ference play over its head to win,
and one that will make the Class of
'33 forget the years of famine.

that the fast clever boy handed to the big, clumsy behemoth. But the
boys from Corvallis just couldn't solve the Indians' bewildering array of
spinners, reverses, double-reverses, and short passes that made the

Beavers tackle three successive men
only to find that a guard had it on
the other side of the line.
Stanford kicked off to Oregon
State, took the ball away from them
before they had a chance to get a
good look at it, marched fifty-four
yards in thirteen plays and had the
score 7-0 before the game was five
minutes old, as Caddel dented
Beaver ground for the first score
and Bill'Corbus kicked goal.
Indians Punch Line
Having given notice that class had
started, the Indian instructed a be
wildered but eager bunch of over
grown boys in the gentle art of pig
skin deception. Whtn the big boy
continued to play rough the Redskin
marched another fifty-four yards in
the second period and scored in
seven plays. Corbus kicked goal
again. Tex Walker, brother of the
famous Ed Walker, made the tally
on a nice sweep around end.
The third period brought a lum
bering ,but still bewildered Beaver
within Stanford's thirty-yard stripe
as Moe intercepted Jack Hillman's
pass and raced to the twenty-six.
But Biancone tried to pass and Hill
man returned the compliment and
the intercepted ball fifteen yards.
Sim Scores
Jump to the fourth period and
Caddel was still smashing inside
end, Hillman battering center, and
Bob Sim, blond newcomer from
Sacramento, racing around end on
long sweeps and darting off tackle
for five or ten yards at a crack.
And then the teacher was satis
fied to let the lesson sink in, only to
have Oregon's Franklin fire a pass
straight at Bob Sim when there was
no one within yards of him. So the
score rose and stopped at 27-0 in
stead of 20-0 as Corbus rang the
conversion bell for the third time.
Hillman Fast
This boy Hillman! Big, fast, ag
gressive, surpassing his brother in
everything but experience already.
He hands the ball to the halves with
perfect timing, and then just when
the defensive line dives for a half,
he spins through center for a first
down.
Ernie Caddel, playing his last sea
son for the Stanford Indian, is a
vastly improved player. He's faster.
He passes more accurately. His
kicks are longer and higher. He's a
better defensive player, and he's
playing football every minute that
he is on the field. When Warner
gets his best line picked and func
tioning there is nothing that can
stop Big Ernie.
Halfbacks Good
Warner has halves, lots of them.
Oregon State, with a continuous
stream of substitutes, saw more
halves than it could count. Maentz,
Afflerbaugh, Van Dellen (watch
him!), Sim, Caddel. They are all
fast, they are all shifty, and they
are all good defensive players.
Oregon State was primed for
Stanford's passes, and Stanford
scored three times through the line
on sheer power. Oregon State un
loosed a passing attack that made

things cloudy, and Stanford stopped
it cold.
'32 Team Better
It may not be the greatest team
in history. It may not win the con
ference. But it's going to be a team
that will make the rest of the con
ference play over its head to win,
and one that will make the Class of
'33 forget the years of famine.
FOUR touchdowns in four quarters, three of them through the line, and
the fourth on an intercepted pass! The best showing for so early in the
season that a Stanford team has made within the memory of even the
hot-stove league. It wasn't a game that Stanford's white-shirted Indians
were playing with the Oregon State Beavers; it was a lesson in football
that the fast clever boy handed to the big, clumsy behemoth. But the
