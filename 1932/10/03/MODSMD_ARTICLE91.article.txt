# FROSH ELEVEN TAKES 18-0 TILT FROM GLENDALE
## Yearlings Show Signs Of Old Class Against Southerners 
### 
Stanford's v freshman football
team, which of recent years has
been less agile and crashing than
it was in the days before the lure
of California and U.S.C. proved so
irresistible to the high school grid
talent of this and neighboring
states, seems finally to have re
turned to it's pre-depression level.
Counting last Saturday's 18 to 0
defeat of Glendale Junior College,
the yearling eleven has now run
up the staggering total of 118 points
to its opponents' none.
The frosh, with more All-this and
Ail-that players on their stjuad than
has graced a Stanford roster for
many years, were not at Vtheir best
Saturday. Playing powerful foot
hall in occasional outbursts, Coach
Chuck Winterburn's men failed to
Score during the first half.
"A" Formation Clicks
In the third quarter, the ancient
Warner off-tackle thrusts from
Pop's reliable "A" formation began
to function, and the frosh scored
twice. Johnny lleisner personally
took care of the last Indian touch
down in the final period.
Bobby Grayson, of Portland, ran
back the first second-half kickoff to
Glendale's 35-yard line. Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alustiza
carried the ball over in six plays,
Alustiza scoring.
Reisner Rambles
The second score came almost
immediately. Glendale kicked off,
Alustiza quick-kicked, and Glen
dale punted to Grayson who ran
the ball back 15 yards. Hamilton
carried the ball to the eight-yard
line. Grayson went over.
Reisner's run in the third quarter
was a magical trick which he per
formed without the aid of mirrors.
Receiving a punt on his forty-yard
line, Johnny found himself sur
rounded by four Glendale Pirates.
He circled back toward his own goal
line and away from the sideline,
then suddenly Spun around and
streaked 00 yards up the side of
the field to score.
First Half Dull
The game began auspiciously
enough for the freshmen. Glendale
kicked off to Grayson, who followed
a mass of yearling interferers down
the right side of the field and then
suddenly handed the ball to Ham
ilton. Hamilton surprised every
one concerned including Glendale
as well as the crowd, who expected
him to be considerate enough to
play orthodox football and follow
his interference, by reversing to his
left and carrying the ball to the
25-yard line.
For the first two periods, the
rooters, who seemed lost in the gi
gantic stadium and who had come
to see the freshman (56 to 0 score
against Taft Junior College dupli
cated, found the battle between the
30-yard lines dull. A radio which
some thoughtful press box inhabi
tant had brought along furnished
the major thrills as the news of the
varsity's mounting score against
Oregon State came over the air, and
there were more cheers for Caddel
and Johnny Hillman than there
were for the freshmen.
Frosh Line Good
Several sparkling runs by Rones
Hamilton did manage to keep the
crowd aware that a freshman game
was in progress. Hamilton, who
comes all teh way from Kiski prep
in Pennsylvania, tore through holes
in the Glendale line when any were
opened, and made his own when

they weren't. His efforts were fruit
less, however, as the frosh passed
the hall away or used poor general
ship whenever within scoring dis
tance.
Throughout the game, Stanford's
defensive line play was impene
trable. Glendale failed to register a
first down, with Laury Rouble from
Lowell most instrumental in smash
ing irate plays. Winterburn used
two full lines, and there was little
to choose between them. Trompas,
Carlson, Haber, Rosenberg, Pinnotti,
Callaway, and Woodard started and
were succeeded by Lcedy, Reynolds,
Adams, Howell, Rouble, Maentz, and
Kingsbury, who appeared the best
of the ends. A gentleman named
Roth also played center, and caused
considerable commotion when he
entered the game because the offi
cials insisted on inspecting his leg
pads to see if they contained any
metal, tire-arms, or other parapher
nalia unbecoming a gentleman.

rounded by four Glendale Pirates.
He circled back toward his own goal
line and away from the sideline,
then suddenly Spun around and
streaked 00 yards up the side of
the field to score.
First Half Dull
The game began auspiciously
enough for the freshmen. Glendale
kicked off to Grayson, who followed
a mass of yearling interferers down
the right side of the field and then
suddenly handed the ball to Ham
ilton. Hamilton surprised every
one concerned including Glendale
as well as the crowd, who expected
him to be considerate enough to
play orthodox football and follow
his interference, by reversing to his
left and carrying the ball to the
25-yard line.
For the first two periods, the
rooters, who seemed lost in the gi
gantic stadium and who had come
to see the freshman (56 to 0 score
against Taft Junior College dupli
cated, found the battle between the
30-yard lines dull. A radio which
some thoughtful press box inhabi
tant had brought along furnished
the major thrills as the news of the
varsity's mounting score against
Oregon State came over the air, and
there were more cheers for Caddel
and Johnny Hillman than there
were for the freshmen.
Frosh Line Good
Several sparkling runs by Rones
Hamilton did manage to keep the
crowd aware that a freshman game
was in progress. Hamilton, who
comes all teh way from Kiski prep
in Pennsylvania, tore through holes
in the Glendale line when any were
opened, and made his own when

they weren't. His efforts were fruit
less, however, as the frosh passed
the hall away or used poor general
ship whenever within scoring dis
tance.
Throughout the game, Stanford's
defensive line play was impene
trable. Glendale failed to register a
first down, with Laury Rouble from
Lowell most instrumental in smash
ing irate plays. Winterburn used
two full lines, and there was little
to choose between them. Trompas,
Carlson, Haber, Rosenberg, Pinnotti,
Callaway, and Woodard started and
were succeeded by Lcedy, Reynolds,
Adams, Howell, Rouble, Maentz, and
Kingsbury, who appeared the best
of the ends. A gentleman named
Roth also played center, and caused
considerable commotion when he
entered the game because the offi
cials insisted on inspecting his leg
pads to see if they contained any
metal, tire-arms, or other parapher
nalia unbecoming a gentleman.
Stanford's v freshman football
team, which of recent years has
been less agile and crashing than
it was in the days before the lure
of California and U.S.C. proved so
irresistible to the high school grid
talent of this and neighboring
states, seems finally to have re
turned to it's pre-depression level.
Counting last Saturday's 18 to 0
defeat of Glendale Junior College,
the yearling eleven has now run
up the staggering total of 118 points
to its opponents' none.
The frosh, with more All-this and
Ail-that players on their stjuad than
has graced a Stanford roster for
many years, were not at Vtheir best
Saturday. Playing powerful foot
hall in occasional outbursts, Coach
Chuck Winterburn's men failed to
Score during the first half.
"A" Formation Clicks
In the third quarter, the ancient
Warner off-tackle thrusts from
Pop's reliable "A" formation began
to function, and the frosh scored
twice. Johnny lleisner personally
took care of the last Indian touch
down in the final period.
Bobby Grayson, of Portland, ran
back the first second-half kickoff to
Glendale's 35-yard line. Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alustiza
carried the ball over in six plays,
Alustiza scoring.
Reisner Rambles
The second score came almost
immediately. Glendale kicked off,
Alustiza quick-kicked, and Glen
dale punted to Grayson who ran
the ball back 15 yards. Hamilton
carried the ball to the eight-yard
line. Grayson went over.
Reisner's run in the third quarter
was a magical trick which he per

ing irate plays. Winterburn used
two full lines, and there was little
to choose between them. Trompas,
Carlson, Haber, Rosenberg, Pinnotti,
Callaway, and Woodard started and
were succeeded by Lcedy, Reynolds,
Adams, Howell, Rouble, Maentz, and
Kingsbury, who appeared the best
of the ends. A gentleman named
Roth also played center, and caused
considerable commotion when he
entered the game because the offi
cials insisted on inspecting his leg
pads to see if they contained any
metal, tire-arms, or other parapher
nalia unbecoming a gentleman.
Stanford's v freshman football
team, which of recent years has
been less agile and crashing than
it was in the days before the lure
of California and U.S.C. proved so
irresistible to the high school grid
talent of this and neighboring
states, seems finally to have re
turned to it's pre-depression level.
Counting last Saturday's 18 to 0
defeat of Glendale Junior College,
the yearling eleven has now run
up the staggering total of 118 points
to its opponents' none.
The frosh, with more All-this and
Ail-that players on their stjuad than
has graced a Stanford roster for
many years, were not at Vtheir best
Saturday. Playing powerful foot
hall in occasional outbursts, Coach
Chuck Winterburn's men failed to
Score during the first half.
"A" Formation Clicks
In the third quarter, the ancient
Warner off-tackle thrusts from
Pop's reliable "A" formation began
to function, and the frosh scored
twice. Johnny lleisner personally
took care of the last Indian touch
down in the final period.
Bobby Grayson, of Portland, ran
back the first second-half kickoff to
Glendale's 35-yard line. Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alustiza
carried the ball over in six plays,
Alustiza scoring.
Reisner Rambles
The second score came almost
immediately. Glendale kicked off,
Alustiza quick-kicked, and Glen
dale punted to Grayson who ran
the ball back 15 yards. Hamilton
carried the ball to the eight-yard
line. Grayson went over.
Reisner's run in the third quarter
was a magical trick which he per
formed without the aid of mirrors.
Receiving a punt on his forty-yard
line, Johnny found himself sur
rounded by four Glendale Pirates.
He circled back toward his own goal
line and away from the sideline,
then suddenly Spun around and
streaked 00 yards up the side of
the field to score.
First Half Dull
The game began auspiciously
enough for the freshmen. Glendale
kicked off to Grayson, who followed
a mass of yearling interferers down
the right side of the field and then
suddenly handed the ball to Ham
ilton. Hamilton surprised every
one concerned including Glendale
as well as the crowd, who expected
him to be considerate enough to
play orthodox football and follow
his interference, by reversing to his
left and carrying the ball to the
25-yard line.
For the first two periods, the
rooters, who seemed lost in the gi
gantic stadium and who had come
to see the freshman (56 to 0 score
against Taft Junior College dupli
cated, found the battle between the
30-yard lines dull. A radio which
some thoughtful press box inhabi
tant had brought along furnished
the major thrills as the news of the
varsity's mounting score against
Oregon State came over the air, and
there were more cheers for Caddel
and Johnny Hillman than there
were for the freshmen.
Frosh Line Good
Several sparkling runs by Rones
Hamilton did manage to keep the
crowd aware that a freshman game
was in progress. Hamilton, who
comes all teh way from Kiski prep
in Pennsylvania, tore through holes
in the Glendale line when any were
opened, and made his own when

they weren't. His efforts were fruit
less, however, as the frosh passed
the hall away or used poor general
ship whenever within scoring dis
tance.
Throughout the game, Stanford's
defensive line play was impene
trable. Glendale failed to register a
first down, with Laury Rouble from
Lowell most instrumental in smash
ing irate plays. Winterburn used
two full lines, and there was little
to choose between them. Trompas,
Carlson, Haber, Rosenberg, Pinnotti,
Callaway, and Woodard started and
were succeeded by Lcedy, Reynolds,
Adams, Howell, Rouble, Maentz, and
Kingsbury, who appeared the best
of the ends. A gentleman named
Roth also played center, and caused
considerable commotion when he
entered the game because the offi
cials insisted on inspecting his leg
pads to see if they contained any
metal, tire-arms, or other parapher
nalia unbecoming a gentleman.
