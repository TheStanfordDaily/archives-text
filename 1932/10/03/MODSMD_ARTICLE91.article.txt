# FROSH ELEVEN TAKES 18-0 TILT FROM GLENDALE
## Yearlings Show Signs Of Old Class Against Southerners 
### 
Stanford's v freshman football
team, which of recent years has
been less agile and crashing than
it was in the days before the lure
of California and U.S.C. proved so
irresistible to the high school grid
talent of this and neighboring
states, seems finally to have re
turned to it's pre-depression level.
Counting last Saturday's 18 to 0
defeat of Glendale Junior College,
the yearling eleven has now run
up the staggering total of 118 points
to its opponents' none.
The frosh, with more All-this and
Ail-that players on their stjuad than
has graced a Stanford roster for
many years, were not at Vtheir best
Saturday. Playing powerful foot
hall in occasional outbursts, Coach
Chuck Winterburn's men failed to
Score during the first half.
"A" Formation Clicks
In the third quarter, the ancient
Warner off-tackle thrusts from
Pop's reliable "A" formation began
to function, and the frosh scored
twice. Johnny lleisner personally
took care of the last Indian touch
down in the final period.
Bobby Grayson, of Portland, ran
back the first second-half kickoff to
Glendale's 35-yard line. Grayson,
Bones Hamilton, and Frank Alustiza
carried the ball over in six plays,
Alustiza scoring.
Reisner Rambles
The second score came almost
immediately. Glendale kicked off,
Alustiza quick-kicked, and Glen
dale punted to Grayson who ran
the ball back 15 yards. Hamilton
