# BEARS SWAMP O.C. IN FOURTH QUARTER RALLY
## Poor Passing By Clubmen Gives U.C. Chance To Snatch Victory 
### Dick Rodda 
With no less than a moral victory
for the Olympic Club glaring in his
face, the California Golden Bear
came out of a trance Saturday af
ternoon to wipe out what appeared
late in the fourth quarter to he a
second consecutive upset to be suf
fered by Bill Ingram's squad. The
score was (5 to 6 with only five
minutes to play when the Bears,
maddened because the Clubmen" had
teased them all afternoon, broke
loose to push over two touchdowns
and score a safety in that last five
minutes of play. The final score
was: California 22, Olympic Club 6.
Moeller Injured
But the Bear rout was not with
out its unfortunate consequences as
Ken Moeller, beefy halfback, was
removed early in the game suffering
from a broken leg that he received
the first time he was called upon to
pack the ball. After a gain of eight
yards Moeller was tackled hard by
Sugden to sustain a compound frac
ture in the left leg.
After displaying alternate periods
of strength and weakness for more
than three quarters of the game the
Bears took the ball on the Club's
16-yard line when a bad pass from
center was recovered by Bill Boone.
Four plays later the ball rested on
the Winged "O" four-yard line, first
and goal for California. But again
the Bears showed weakness and in
four more plays the ball was only
one yard closer to the goal. On the
next plaj', however, the disgusted
Bear saved itself moral defeat when
another bad pass from center by the
Olympic was recovered over the end
zone for an automatic safety.
Keefer Scores
Following this, the Olympic Club
kicked from the 20-yard line and
California gained possession of the
ball in mid-field. On the next play,
a spinner, Keefer galloped for 50
yards and a touchdown. California
kicked off to the Olympic Cluh, the
Clubmen opened a desperate but
futile passing attack, the Bears
blocked a pitnt and Sparling
scooped up the ball and raced to
another touchdown to complete the
scoring.
'Except-' for those last few tense
moments California's victory was
far from brilliant. Their aerial at
tack was almost a complete failure
and although the Olympic Club line
leaked like a sieve during the first
half, the Bears could not muster
enough punch to score more than
once. It was the Bear passing at
tack that enabled the Clubmen to
make their lone score in the third
quarter and tie things up. Davis in
tercepted a pass and ran 60 yards
to a score.
The Bears made their first score
early in the game when Williams
ran from the Olympic 29-yard line
to the five-yard line. Keefer took
the ball and made the score after
two attempts.
