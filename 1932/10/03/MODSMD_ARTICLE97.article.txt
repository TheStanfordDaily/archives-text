# SOCCER OUTLOOK BRIGHT FOR BOTH VARSITY, FROSH SQUADS-COACH
## 
### 
Smiling with an anti-depression
istic optimism born of larger than
usual soccer turnout for both the
varsity and frosh .squads, Coach
Harry Maloney is facing the pros
pect of building his two little Bed
Machines with eager anticipation of
a good season ahead.
Confronted with the task of fill
ing two important holes left by
Buster Holmes and Jim Webster at
fullback and goal-keeper, Maloney
is comforted with the willing aid of
several veteran letter men of last
year's varsity and frosh outfits.
Cy Johnson, Art Hearn and Carl
Knecht will return to the forward
wall when roll is called out on the
varsity field this afternoon at 4:20,
and Maloney boasts of three prom
ising halves in the persons of Alex
Spoer, Waddy White and Stan Ken
nedy.
A record registration-day sign-Up
of 48 varsity and 18 freshman pros
pects is expected to be greatly aug
mented by additional men at to
day's practice. Coach Maloney
stressed the fact that it is not too
late to sign up for either squad.
The varsity squad will be without
a captain until one can be elected
to fill the shoes of Johnny Moore,
captain-elect, who will not return
to the Farm this quarter. It will
meet its first real test in a game
scheduled with San Jose State
Teachers' College on Wednesday,

October 12, and will face tough
opposition the following Saturday
against San Mateo Junior College.
Three games, the first, of which
falls on November 5, have been set
for the annual series with Califor
nia. The freshman schedule has not
been completed as yet.
