# Women's Tennis Courts Get New Surface, Fence
## 
### 
In a reconditioning program car
ried on throughout the summer by
the women's physical education de
partment, the tennis courts in the
rear of the women's gymnasium have
been resurfaced and a new fence
erected, said Dr. Bertha Dyment to
day. The courts will be ready for
use tomorrow.
Fencing on two sides of the swim
ming pool, later to be filled in with
shrubs, completes the outside work
as hockey fields and basketball
courts have been kept in good con
dition during the summer.
A refrigerated drinking fountain
has been installed in the gymnasium
as the final step in the conditioning
plan.
A goldfish club has been organ
ized at Roanoke College. Pledges
must swallow one live goldfish
during initiation.
