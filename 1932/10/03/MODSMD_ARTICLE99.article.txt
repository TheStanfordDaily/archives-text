# Maloney Sees Strong Boxing Team For '33
## 
### Dick Strouse 
Three former Card mittmen, two
experienced transfers, and a pugi
listic basketball player should com
bine to give Stanford one of the
strongest boxing teams in her his
tory this year. At least, that is the
opinion of coaches Harry Maloney
and Myron Schail, and past per
formances bear out their predic
tions.
Heading the many-weighted array
of Indian mitt talent, is Phil Smith,
1932 Pacific Coast intercollegiate
heavyweight champion. Smith's baf
fling defense and two-handed attack
should again make him the class of
college heavies.
Keith Topping, basketball man
who boxed considerably last spring,
will represent Stanford as a light
heavyweight if he can defeat Larry
Hill. Hill is the novice heavyweight
champion of Stanford.
The 1932 captain, Fred Glover,
who was unable to fight last year
because of injuries, is back and will
be hard to beat if he is anywhere
near his 1931 form. Glover takes
care of the lightweight division, and
Jack Pcrego looks at present to lie
the class of the middleweights.
Little Yuji Imai, two-year vet
eran, will finish his collegiate box
ing career this season again as a
bantamweight. A star from S.F.U.,
Jim Feelcy by name, should prevent
any opposing featherweights from
scoring points against Stanford.
None other than the A.A.U. junior
welterweight champion will be
added to the Card roster this year.
He is Waldo Mundy, and comes
from San Mateo Junior College with
a great welterweight record.
