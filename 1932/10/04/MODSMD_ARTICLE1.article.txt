# POVERTY DROVE TEMPLETON TO MURDER, CLAIM
## Parental Quarrel Given As Cause Of Student's Deranged Mind LAWYER BARES MOTIVE Boy Believed Uncle Caused Financial Trouble 
### 
SAN JOSE, Oct. 3 (/IV-The mo
tive for the fatal stabbing of Mrs.
Lillian Babcock and the serious
wounding of her husband, William
Rider Babcock of Manila, was bared
here today to the trial of George
Douglas Templeton, Jr., on trial for
his life for the murder of his aunt,
Mrs. Babcock.
The mind of Templeton, 20-year
old former University of California
student, snapped after a quarrel be
tween his father and mother, Major
and Mrs. G. D. Templeton, the de
fense claimed.
Poverty Turns Mind
It snapped when he heard his
mother upbraid his father because
he could not earn enough money to
support Mrs. Templeton and their
three children.
And his deranged mind was
turned with thoughts of hatred to
ward his uncle, Babcock, when he
heard his father say that it was be
cause all his money was invested
with Babcock in his Manila import
ing and exporting firm, because
Babce :k was "manipulating" the
stock in the firm, because of this
manipulation that Major Templeton
was almost penniless.
Killing Quickly Follows
Less than IS hours after young
Templeton heard this quarrel he
stole into the dark bedroom where
the Babcocks lay sleeping in a little
Los Altos cottage. At 3 o'clock in
the morning, while both were asleep,
the college student stabbed to death
Mrs. Babcock with a ten - inch
kitchen knife, wounded Babcock in
foui places, and escaped into the
night. This explanation of the trag
edy that shocked Northern Califor
nia last July was given today in the
court of Superior Judge Robert F.
Syer, before whom Templeton is on
trial.
Told by Attorney
But it was not given by a wit
ness, nor was it given in the pres
ence of the seven women and five
men who will decide on Templeton'c
fate.
Barred from the testimony of Ma
jor Templeton by the objections of
Prosecutors John J. Fitzgerald and
Herbert S. Bridges, the story of
that family quarrel was told by
Thomas D. Aitken, chief defense at
torney, in the absence of the jury.
II was told by Aitken in an "offer
of proof" that was rejected by the
court.
