# Debaters Will Meet Tonight
## 
### 
At a meeting tonight at 7 o'clock
in Room 202 of the English building,
all candidates for the varsity, fresh
man, and women's debate squads
will be told the forensic plans for
the ensuing year.

With a majority of last year's var
sity squad returning to the Farm, an
enthusiastic season of activity looms
for the local orators. Last year's
squad was the largest in Stanford
history and the freshman squad,
coached by Virgil Anderson, devel
oped some encouraging prospects
for this year's speech aggregation.
In the absence of James Gordon
Emerson, Leland Chapin will again
supervise the efforts of the varsity
orators, assisted by Professor Wil
liam Hawley Davis.
An extensive schedule of debates
is planned for the Cardinal squad
this year. The first series of debates
will be between Stanford and U.S.C.
and California. Probably another
barnstorming debate tour equaling
that of last year will be arranged
for the spring quarter.
