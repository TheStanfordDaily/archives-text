# JAPAN BRANDS LYTTON REPORT BIASED, HOSTILE
## World In General Lauds Findings On Situation In Far Fast 
### 
GENEVA, Oct. 3. (A')--World
opinion, expressed through unoffi
cial channels, generally approved
the Lytton Commission report to the
League of Nations on the situation
in the Far East.

Japan, however, has denounced
the report as biased and hostile. In
a statement by the War Office, she
threatened to withdraw from the
League of Nations and to oppose
vigorously any attempt by the
League to enforce the recommenda
tions of the commission.

None of ihe responsible Chinese
government officials has com
mented, pending study of the report
in detail. Leaders of the old Man
churian regime, now in Peiping,
were said to have welcomed it as a
basis for settlement. It was assumed
that the national government lead
ers would accept most of the report,
perhaps with a few minor reserva
tions.

Washington generally regards
the document as supporting the ad
ministration attitude toward the
events which led to organization of
the state of Manchukuo.

At Geneva, where the report was
to be considered by the League
Council on November 14, it was
generally received with satisfaction
in all quarters except by the Japa
nese. In the other European capitals
there was no official comment.
