# Grid Games To Be Broadcast
## 
### 
All Stanford football games will
be broadcast by radio this year, as
will all Pacific Coast Conference
games, according to Don Lieben
dorfer, publicity director of the
Board of Athletic Control. The Pa
cific Coast is the only region where
radios will make the gridiron avail
able to those not paying admission
to the games. Eastern conferences
have voted to withhold broadcast
j ing rights on games, because of the
i depression.
It was felt here that permitting
I broadcasting would encourage peo
j pie to pay admission to see the
I games. It is not at present known
j whether or not the Stanford-Pitts
j burg game will go on the air, Lie
| bendorfer said.
