# Smith Drives Men For Hard Contest Against Cardinals
## Clever Santa Clara Backs Expected to Provide Bad Time For Stanford Saturday; Warner Starts Secret Practices With Redshirts 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Fifteen miles south of the Quad there's a storm brewing.
It's the dust stirred up on Santa Clara's practice football field, where
I eleven mad Broncos are kicking up the traces of a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon University.
They're white at the mouth down at Jackie Coogan's adopted home
town, from Head Coach Clipper Smith to assistant program salesmen,
and it's a good bet that when the erstwhile peaceful Padres face Stanford's
undefeated gridders on Saturday afternoon, those eleven Broncos will be

prepared to turn in the greatest
show of football in the history of
Santa Clara University.
Pop Warner isn't handing Santa
Clara the game on a silver platter,
however. After he heard an expert
account of the Bronco-Oregon clas
sic from John Bunn, Warner an
nounced that Santa Clara would
probably defeat his team, but when
he arrived on the campus secret
practice was instituted —not one of
those innocuous secret practices de
signed to clear the field of stray dogs
and high school students, but so
secret a practice that even Stanford's
hardy band of correspondents cooled
their heels outside the practice field
walls.

Any team with Vin O'Donnel,
Chuck Fuller, Jack Farris, and "Dia
mond Joe" Paglia in its backfield
would wreak havoc with the best
line on the Pacific Coast, for much
j of Santa Clara's offensive weakness
[ against Oregon last week may be
i chalked up to overconfidence.
One trip down to Santa Clara
j practice field last week was enough
| to prove that in Diamond Joe Paglia
1 Santa Clara has the most accurate
! kicker the writer has ever seen.
| Last year Paglia's out -of - bounds
! kicking to within the five-yard line
forced Stanford to punt out of dan
ger time after time. This fall Paglia
is stronger and more canny than
ever-—he is no longer harassed by
j the injuries that kept him from na
j tion-wide recognition in 1931.
Punting Duel Looms
If Stan Anderson, now a fullback,
plays in Saturday's game, fans who
witness the battle will be treated to
] a "punting duel" fit only for kings
iof football. Anderson's only kick of
'the season was a 58-yarder against
San Francisco's Dons, but his punt
ing in practice scrimmages has been
even more sensational.
Warner will probably start Line
men Tod and Colvin, ends; Laborde
and Grey, tackles; Corbus and Kite,
guards; Bates, center, against Santa
| Clara's 197-pound line. The Broncs
have a super-end in "Hands" Slav
ich, whose basketball experience
1 has taught him never to miss a well
j thrown pass.
One serious Stanford injury oc
curred in the Oregon State game,
j Bob Maentz, tricky, fast, slippery
, left halfback, will be out of foot
ball until the U.S.C. game, where
he will be badly needed. In the
j meantime Kenny Affferbaugh, one of
j Stanford's most underrated players,
| will be shifted again, back to left
1 halfback, to fill Maentz's shoes. The
showing of Bill Sim indicates that
this tow-headed, hard-running half
| back is out for a permanent stran
i globoid on the left halfback job.

Punting Duel Looms
If Stan Anderson, now a fullback,
plays in Saturday's game, fans who
witness the battle will be treated to
] a "punting duel" fit only for kings
iof football. Anderson's only kick of
'the season was a 58-yarder against
San Francisco's Dons, but his punt
ing in practice scrimmages has been
even more sensational.
Warner will probably start Line
men Tod and Colvin, ends; Laborde
and Grey, tackles; Corbus and Kite,
guards; Bates, center, against Santa
| Clara's 197-pound line. The Broncs
have a super-end in "Hands" Slav
ich, whose basketball experience
1 has taught him never to miss a well
j thrown pass.
One serious Stanford injury oc
curred in the Oregon State game,
j Bob Maentz, tricky, fast, slippery
, left halfback, will be out of foot
ball until the U.S.C. game, where
he will be badly needed. In the
j meantime Kenny Affferbaugh, one of
j Stanford's most underrated players,
| will be shifted again, back to left
1 halfback, to fill Maentz's shoes. The
showing of Bill Sim indicates that
this tow-headed, hard-running half
| back is out for a permanent stran
i globoid on the left halfback job.
Fifteen miles south of the Quad there's a storm brewing.
It's the dust stirred up on Santa Clara's practice football field, where
I eleven mad Broncos are kicking up the traces of a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon University.
They're white at the mouth down at Jackie Coogan's adopted home
town, from Head Coach Clipper Smith to assistant program salesmen,
and it's a good bet that when the erstwhile peaceful Padres face Stanford's
undefeated gridders on Saturday afternoon, those eleven Broncos will be

prepared to turn in the greatest
show of football in the history of
Santa Clara University.
Pop Warner isn't handing Santa
Clara the game on a silver platter,
however. After he heard an expert
account of the Bronco-Oregon clas
sic from John Bunn, Warner an
nounced that Santa Clara would
probably defeat his team, but when
he arrived on the campus secret
practice was instituted —not one of
those innocuous secret practices de
signed to clear the field of stray dogs
and high school students, but so
secret a practice that even Stanford's
hardy band of correspondents cooled
their heels outside the practice field
walls.
