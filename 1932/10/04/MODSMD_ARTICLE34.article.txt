following: . . . and don't buy a fall suit until you see the
latest creations at \s. These are the same fash
ions in favor willi smart business men on the streets of
San Francisco and with the well-dressed men on the Stan

Now surely the erstwhile crooner meant "the fashions
in favor with liie well-dressed Stanford man on the streets
of San Francisco,' didn't lie? Still, there was something in
his lone which implied another meaning, that Stanford
men actually are wearing suits on the Quad, or soon will
be.
Although this dissertation on fall fashions is not in
lended lor a premature obituary on the long bed-ridden
and fasl-lailing Stanford rough, a word for his welfare is
far from amiss. Fxcepting the fundamental factor of their
presence or absence, clothes have never made a great deal
of difference among the males on the Quad. The Stanford
rough is a tradition, and the democracy in dress which lie
represents should be guarded, against the slv insinuations
of hustling clotlii'ig salesmen.
Without going inlo the virtues of a slovenly demeanor,
ii must be admitted that 'he modern descendant of the
rough is one of the few remaining props of the local spirit
of democracy. For that reason, lie should ignore all radio
fashion hints. Resides, how could a person distinguish a
law student from any ordinary mortal, if that radio an
nouncer's dream should be true?
