# POOR STANFORD!
## 
### 
II was a dark day lor Stanford, thai fateful Saturday
of Big (lame football in the Stadium last autumn when a
wintry wind carried a chant strange to the ears of every
student fan in the stands. Alter sixty minutes of gridiron
warfare il was "Poor Stanford" where for years it had been
"Poor C«al."
Tears were shed on that afternoon, shed on the grave
of Hie poor, dead Indian. Jlis colors had not only been
lowered for a year; they had been torn from the victory
mast they h;id occupied for seven years, to be replaced by
;< blue and gold banner destined to remain for as long,
perhaps, as the Cardinal had waved. So everyone said,
I hen.
I bus it is not surprising that 3500 students returned
to the Farm lasi week somewhat bewildered at the turn
gridiron affairs had taken during their absence. The Bear
thai was to laze in the spotlight of victory had been beaten.
The Indian that was to grovel for years in the rut of defeat
bad steamrollered its early season opposition in impressive
fash ion.
Perhaps il is the change of policy which promises to
fortify instead of abolish the lower division. Perhaps it is
the reorganization of the coaching staff, which puts the
spirited Jimmy iiradshaw in the varsity ranks and brings
Krnie Xc vers to the* Farm as an assistant coach. Perhaps
il is that the ire of the Indian has been aroused by that (i to
0 Big (lame defeat.
.Inst what il is matters little. Hut what does matter is
that in the three weeks that football has thus far been under
way, the team has shown more concentrated light and lire
Ihan it has throughout any one of the past four years.
A strange manner indeed for Stanford to embark on its
dark era of Big (lame football!
