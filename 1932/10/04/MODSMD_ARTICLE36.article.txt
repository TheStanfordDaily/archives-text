A continual lino pouring in ail day aiul each member of
it reeling thai his or her needs are the most important.
Questions on every imaginable subject, the greater part of
which are entirely irrelevant. All of this and much more
has to he undergone by the stall' at the Stanford Bookstore.
(live 'em a break! This greatly maligned group of peo
ple are only human and are subject to all the usual failings
of the specie. When you ask the lady at the ink counter
whether you should take Psych .">1 or Biology 2 don't get
sore when she refuses to come through with the informa
tion.
And now that the Bookstore is up for discussion there
is one section that is often overlooked by the students and
would pro lit anyone to investigate. At the back and to the
1< ft as you go in is a section reserved for fiction and other
forms of literature not necessarily covered in courses. In
charge of this department is a very delightful lady, who is
not only widely read, but who has a very distinct taste in
literary matters.
Go into this section, browse around (they welcome this
pursuit) and look over the books that are collected there,
it is ;i eertaintx that their will be something that will in
terest anyone as the choice and range of the books has been
very carefully selected. If you have any special type or
variety of book that you are interested in go up to the lady
in charge and ask her advice. She is well fitted to give
out all the information possible on your special topic.
There are practically do/ens of wise words the higher
ups w ill pass 011 to those members of the editorial stall' who
care to drop around at 1:20 o'clock this afternoon.
