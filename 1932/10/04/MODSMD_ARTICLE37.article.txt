# BULL SESSION
## PROWLERS OF THE NIGHT 
### 
Ballyhoo has been carried to the
peaks of clever artistry. Stunts to
bring attention to whatever one de
sires to bring attention to are with
out end. But probably the simplest,
most obnoxious, and uncalled for bit
of publicity was practiced the other
night by some prowlers of the night
who plastered campus windshields
with gay-colored prohibition propa
ganda.
The literature was not gently
pasted; but was so thoroughly glu?d
that razors, water, gasoline, formal
dahyde, and old Union coffee were
necessary to remove the blatant
stigmas from the glass. And where
were these symbols of a cause that
has been repudiated by both nation
al parties, President Hoover and
practically everyone except Repub- |
lican-dead-weight-Curtis placed? Off '
to the right? Near the bottom? j
Never! But right smack in the
driver's spot!
The logic of ever pasting things on
people's cars without their consent j
is always dubious. To clumsily smear j
these placards in such a location as j
to make safe driving impossiblej
without intensive labor is campaign!
diplomacy that makes the nadir loom j
like Mt. Everest. Whether done by j
order of some Prohibition organiza
tion or by the zeal of some martyr |
to the cause, the plastering is in- i
dicative of the dry psychology at i
the present.
Beaten from pillar to post by

, straw polls—gangster bullets—de
pression-and awakened, militant
liberalism, the dry forces are one
step from the maniac-depressive
ward of the National Political Asy
lum. Frankly unable to make up
their minds what to do, they have
split and shattered into a half-dozen
contradicting factions —each more
j miserable than the ether.
It finally looks like the unbal
i anced budget, the unbalanced pock
etbook, and the unbalanced mob
mind—all seeing some shade of
"red" because of the depression will
smash both femurs of tottering old
man depression in booting him to
oblivion. All the fine Jeffersonian
philosophy that personal liberty was
' holy and sacred never made a dent
lin the liquor-proof armour. The
; great Anglo-Saxon tradition was
1 just so much applesauce before the
powerful political machine of the
! Anti-Saloon League. It made a
' steamroller look like a kiddie car in
j its ability to stamp out opposition.
And now the wee little child of
: Neil Dow and Carrie Nation —nursed
! along in our time by Clarence Wil
| son—is to be deserted on the door
! step of the toughest stepmother of
i them all—depression. The howling
little brat will soon be gone—prob
| ably drowned within twelve months
j in a barrel of REAL legal beer! The
Panic of 1932 will kill prohibition;
but' intelligent people can justify the
homicide on the philosophy of per
sonal liberty. — Abe Mellinkoff
