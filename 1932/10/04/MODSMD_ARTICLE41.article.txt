"HOLD 'EM JAIL"—(I\KO) — At'
the Varsity Theatre.
Beit Wheeler and Bob Woolsey
j reopened the Varsity amid the
I shrieks of the kiddies matinee with
! their latest comedy feature, a trav
| esty on the recent inter-prison foot
j ball games. The stars are just as
; they have always been, and as such
| were enjoyed by the audience. The
j story, written by College Humor
1 Perelman, who keeps the Marx
| Brothers supplied with gags, moves
| along at a fast pace and is crammed
I with laughs. The Bidemore Prison
Alumni Association, seeing that the
! football season looks bad for the old
j institution, recruit football material,
j Edgar Kennedy, as Elmer the war
| den, steals all honors from the two
W's with his Mr. Average Man an- '
j tics. Edna May Oliver does her
| usual sniffing, and Betty Grable
| supplies the love interest with
i Wheeler.
The absence of any songs distin
! guishes this feature from all past
j Wheeler-Woolsey shows, and the |
j lack of music, while speeding up
the action, detracts from the all
around entertainment value of the
picture.
"Satan's Playground," a travelogue :
of Death Valley, although overly
long, was one of the best of the j
nature pictures seen for some time.
Lillian Roth, seen in the past Cheva- ;
lier pictures, sings "Down Among J
the Sugar Cane" to the accompani- j
ment of the well-known bouncing
ball. Mr. Hearst, in his Metrotone
j News Reel features twenty minutes
with that well-known star, Franklin
I D Roosevelt—not a good actor. Her- '
I bie Hoover is in the supporting cast. !
—8.0.8.
TWO AGAINST THE WORLD —
(Warner) —At the New Stanford
Theatre.
Constance Bennett suffers again, and
in much the same manner through
another of her half-baked dramas
of the problems of the modern girl
born o<" poor but rich parents.
"Two Against the World" is defi
nietly a comedown for La Bennett
after "What Price Hollywood'"' if
lor no other reason than that she
no longer has Lowell Sherman to
aid her. Neil Hamilton again ap
pears as her leading man.
The film gets off to a slow start
land about, halfway through develops!

1 some shred of a plot. The characters
are all pretty nebulous, only that of
Miss Bennett being clearly sketched.
(The sketch is a copy of the original
dated about three years ago.)
Neil Hamilton, a young lawyer
with ideals, tries some enlightened
living on the daughter of the dis
gustingly wealthy family, only to
be confronted with the fact that the
brother has killed Victor Lindley,
, believing that Lindley was having
an affair with Connie. The upshot
is that Neil is called upon to prose
: cute his sweetheart and gallantly
falls down on the job. And at that
point the whole thing collapses from
the slender framework upon which
it had been hung.
Hamilton is good, and Helen Vin
i son shows promise in a minor role.
This will be enjoyed by those who
like to watch Constance Bennett
raise her eyebrows and display
gowns, and' those who are easily
pleased by their movies. - E.C.
AS HUSBANDS GO—At the Alca
i zar Theatre, San Francisco.
Henry Duffy has opened his fall
season with Pauline Frederick (her
self), an excellent opening attrac
| tion for any season. She interprets
the part of Emmie Sykes, a very
American middle-aged woman sud
; denly Continental all because of a
1 pair of adoring eyes and the soft
! lights found in Paris.
The vehicle is light and gay ex
cept for the encumbrance of a
I typical Duffy moral and a very ob
vious urge for the bigger and better
; things in life.
However, the scene in the second
act between the present husband
and the continental importation is so
genuine and so well done that it

alone makes up for any weaknesses
of the play. Richard Tucker and
Bramwell Fletcher, both of movie
fame, play the respective parts of
husband and would-be. The flow of
the brandy and the flow of the
lines is so natural that even the
audience is prone to develop a thirst.
Other cast members of particular
note are Miss Gladys George, Em
mie's partner in foreign intrigue,
and Master Jay Ward, who quite
steals the show with his juvenile
role. —E.E.H.

It seems fitting that having paid
"to the order of Stanford Univer
sity," we should complete our regis
tration by signing up for a course in
"College Love" under the eminent
Professor Fio-Rito. The course in
cludes a detailed study of sweet
harmony, rhythm, and trick inci
dentals. Syllabus fees are the same;
prerequisites, none.
The professor has been doing
things this summer. Besides writing
"Three on a Match," "From A.M. to
P.M.," "College Love," and a num
ber of other hits, he ha. l , been add
ing a few members to his band,
namely Muzzy Marehellino and a
couple of blondes who sing- NOT
soprano, thank fortune! .
If you have returned to school
with eyes turned cityward in search
of good music and soft lights, may
we add here that both are available
in no uncertain terms in the "beau
tiful new Garden Room of the St.
Francis Hotel" as our Columbia an
nouncer so persistently puts it. —E.H.

the part of Emmie Sykes, a very
American middle-aged woman sud
; denly Continental all because of a
1 pair of adoring eyes and the soft

The vehicle is light and gay ex
cept for the encumbrance of a
I typical Duffy moral and a very ob
vious urge for the bigger and better
; things in life.
However, the scene in the second
act between the present husband
and the continental importation is so
genuine and so well done that it

alone makes up for any weaknesses
of the play. Richard Tucker and
Bramwell Fletcher, both of movie
fame, play the respective parts of
husband and would-be. The flow of
the brandy and the flow of the
lines is so natural that even the
audience is prone to develop a thirst.
Other cast members of particular
note are Miss Gladys George, Em
mie's partner in foreign intrigue,
and Master Jay Ward, who quite
steals the show with his juvenile
role. —E.E.H.

Constance Bennett suffers again, and

of the problems of the modern girl
born o<" poor but rich parents.
"Two Against the World" is defi
nietly a comedown for La Bennett

lor no other reason than that she
no longer has Lowell Sherman to

The film gets off to a slow start
land about, halfway through develops!

1 some shred of a plot. The characters
are all pretty nebulous, only that of
Miss Bennett being clearly sketched.
(The sketch is a copy of the original
dated about three years ago.)
Neil Hamilton, a young lawyer
with ideals, tries some enlightened
living on the daughter of the dis
gustingly wealthy family, only to
be confronted with the fact that the
brother has killed Victor Lindley,
, believing that Lindley was having
an affair with Connie. The upshot
is that Neil is called upon to prose
: cute his sweetheart and gallantly
falls down on the job. And at that
point the whole thing collapses from
the slender framework upon which
it had been hung.
Hamilton is good, and Helen Vin
i son shows promise in a minor role.
This will be enjoyed by those who
like to watch Constance Bennett
raise her eyebrows and display
gowns, and' those who are easily
pleased by their movies. - E.C.
AS HUSBANDS GO—At the Alca

Henry Duffy has opened his fall
season with Pauline Frederick (her
self), an excellent opening attrac
| tion for any season. She interprets
the part of Emmie Sykes, a very
American middle-aged woman sud
; denly Continental all because of a
1 pair of adoring eyes and the soft
! lights found in Paris.
The vehicle is light and gay ex
cept for the encumbrance of a
I typical Duffy moral and a very ob
vious urge for the bigger and better
; things in life.
However, the scene in the second
act between the present husband
and the continental importation is so
genuine and so well done that it

alone makes up for any weaknesses
of the play. Richard Tucker and
Bramwell Fletcher, both of movie
fame, play the respective parts of
husband and would-be. The flow of
the brandy and the flow of the
lines is so natural that even the
audience is prone to develop a thirst.
Other cast members of particular
note are Miss Gladys George, Em
mie's partner in foreign intrigue,
and Master Jay Ward, who quite
steals the show with his juvenile
role. —E.E.H.
