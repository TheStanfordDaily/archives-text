How itit Pain Alio, ancient land-'
i mark and University emblem, which
is now slowly dying from the poi- |
jsonous fumes of passing trains and j
i for lack of water, was first endan- ;
| gered by man and saved by a fleet;
I of sailing vessels from New England,;
| was revealed when an article on the j
Santa Clara Valley in 1849 was dis
! covered last week in volume one of .
1 "The Sequoia." Emory Evans Smith, 1
writing for the weekly, tells the J
I story under the title of "Unrecorded
History of Palo Alto.''
Towering above the oaks that
1 dotted the plain between San Fran
cisco and San Jose, two great red-
I woods could be seen on clear days
| from San Jose to the south, and
! from San Jose to the south, and
, | from Rincon Hill in San Francisco
; i to the north.
There were several smaller red
i woods down the creek from the
Palos Colorados, and a great many
j fine specimens at the Maximo Mar
i tinez Rancho, now known as Sears
! ville. In 1849-50 one Edward T. A
J Gallagher, established two lumbei
| camps near the trees. One was 10-1
1 cated at the bottom of Canada del ,

1 f 1;.11k nl a nearby mountain. He em
ployed 115 men ripping out the trees
j with whip-saws.
It was planned several times to i
j cut the Palos Colorados, and each
; time the plan was hindered by one
; thing or another. The cost of haul
' ing the lumber out of the hills was
; enormous, and the men were finally •
1 about to fell the trees when news
1 was brought from San Francisco
i that the Argonaut Fleet had arrived
with a load of lumber from New
England. Lumber prices fell, and the
camps were abandoned. The ma
jority of the redwoods about Sears
i ville had been cut, but the Palos
! Colorados remained.
j Several years later one of the trees j
| was undermined by the flood-waters 1
j of the creek and fell. The other one ,
I became known as the Palo Alto. It
j was saved from the encroachments j
of the creek by a concrete wall built j
when the present railroad bridge |
,vas erected. Today, held in place by ;
large cables, it is slowly dying. Sci- ,
entists claim that nothing can save
the tree from the poisonous loco- |
! motive fumes.
