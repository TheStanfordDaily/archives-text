### Dick Strouse 
Pointing out tho mistakes mack' in
last Saturday's game with Glendale
Junior College, Fre linvin ( oach
"Chuck" Winterburn put hi'- men
through a hard workout yesterday
preparatory to meeting M;iteo
Junior College th'.s weekend. Iho
frosh emerged irom the Glendale
battle with no serious injuries, but
expect their hardest game to date
from the San Mateans.
Winterburn spent a short time in
structing the men via the old chalk
talk method, and then ran the vari
ous teams through a slid signal drill.
The linemen cursed California's fa
mous sun while pushing the charg
ing sled around the field, and then
Ihe entire squad practiced on funda
mentals.
Two of the three men from Kiski
Prep who came from Pennsylvania
1o lend strength to the frosh team
will be out el the San Mateo clash.
They are All Brandin, husky first
string tackle whose injured leg may
deprive the yearlings of his services
for the remainder of the season, und
Joe Moscript, stellar end. Moscript
broke his log playing baseball last
spring, and the limb has as yet not
healed sufficiently to make the rig
ens of football either pleasing or
possible to him.
The only other important casu
ally is Erskine, a line guard from
Piedmont. Erskine, a sociable per
son, managed to keep the injuries
consistent as it is his leg also that
is bothering' him, but he should be
back for work in a few days.
The third Kiski Prep star is none
other than "Bones" Hamilton, who
was considered just about the finest
thing in a football way in Pennsyl
vania. Hamilton, although he limped
out of Saturday's game, will be
ready to start against San Mateo
and should drive through for many
a yard from his right halfback post.
Winterburn reminisced a bit about
Saturday's tussle, and explained just
why the frosh failed to score
throughout the first half. Two in
tercepted passes, a blocked punt,
and a pass attempt on fourth down
Ihat was incomplete spoiled the four
Indian marches tov.ard the Glendale
goal. The frosh power, only spas
modic in the first two quarters,
manifested itself during the second
half when the yearlings scored three
times.
Following San Mateo, the frosh
meet the U.C.L.A. baby bruins,
U.S.C.'s first-year men, and then
California's Bear Cubs in rapid suc
cession. And as Winterburn said
yesterday, this year's freshman team
is not fearing any opponent until it
is beaten.

Two of the three men from Kiski
Prep who came from Pennsylvania
1o lend strength to the frosh team
will be out el the San Mateo clash.
They are All Brandin, husky first
string tackle whose injured leg may
deprive the yearlings of his services
for the remainder of the season, und
Joe Moscript, stellar end. Moscript
broke his log playing baseball last
spring, and the limb has as yet not
healed sufficiently to make the rig
ens of football either pleasing or
possible to him.
The only other important casu
ally is Erskine, a line guard from
Piedmont. Erskine, a sociable per
son, managed to keep the injuries
consistent as it is his leg also that
is bothering' him, but he should be
back for work in a few days.
The third Kiski Prep star is none
other than "Bones" Hamilton, who
was considered just about the finest
thing in a football way in Pennsyl
vania. Hamilton, although he limped
out of Saturday's game, will be
ready to start against San Mateo
and should drive through for many
a yard from his right halfback post.
Winterburn reminisced a bit about
Saturday's tussle, and explained just
why the frosh failed to score
throughout the first half. Two in
tercepted passes, a blocked punt,
and a pass attempt on fourth down
Ihat was incomplete spoiled the four
Indian marches tov.ard the Glendale
goal. The frosh power, only spas
modic in the first two quarters,
manifested itself during the second
half when the yearlings scored three
times.
Following San Mateo, the frosh
meet the U.C.L.A. baby bruins,
U.S.C.'s first-year men, and then
California's Bear Cubs in rapid suc
cession. And as Winterburn said
yesterday, this year's freshman team
is not fearing any opponent until it
is beaten.
