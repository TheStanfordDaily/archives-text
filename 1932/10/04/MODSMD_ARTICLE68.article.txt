### 
I .
Stanford's R.O.T.C. will have the
j benefit of 21 more horstes this year,
j Besides materially aiding the de
partment in providing more and bet
ter mounts for the equitation classes,
j the polo team will have' the advan
tage of a faster string of ponies than 1
; heretofore. There are now 87 horse;;
stabled here.
Although the new horsios arc first- ;
class mounts, none of tfoem has yet j
been broken to play polo. Each I
member of the polo A squad will
have one of these ponies for his
extra horse during the season so
, that by spring the mounts should
be sufficiently trained to>' play.
Other improvements' at the
R.O.T.C. include a new riding pen
equipped with a sand floor. The
Highway polo field has been kept
watered all summer so ihnt it is now
I in excellent shape.
