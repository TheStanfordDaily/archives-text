WITH WASHINGTON AND
CALIFORNIA presenting shells
in great confusion, promising
any and ail aid, and already ar
ranging for races, the Univer
sity of California at Los Ange
les (U.C.L.A. to you!) has taken
up the grand old sport of. row
ing with the best possible chance
for success.
George Pocock, premier racing
shell builder of. the Pacific Coast,
has agreed to give them one trim
shell gratis with the one they have
already contracted, and the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley is
sending a boat or two. Meanwhile
the City of Long Beach has had a
practice barge built and this too will
be presented to little Bruin.
No less than ninety prospective
oarsmen greeted Major Goodsell,
Bruin mentor, and from these un
tried men he will try to pick an
eight that can furnish competition
for the crews of Washington and
California when they meet on the
2000-meter Olympic rowing course
in Long Beach April 22 next.

THERE IS REALLY NO
REAL REASON EOR getting so
steamed up because Oregon took
Santa Ciara down the line. The
lironcs had accomplished some
thing that the school had longed
for through many seasons—and
always without satisfaction.
They had beaten C'al.
The Bears may have been beaten,
but they put up as much battle as
they could, and with their beef that
is bound to do something. And
when till is said and done, Oregon is
only bearing out the predictions that
were made before the season even
started to the effect that they would
be the whips of the Northwest. You
can't turn a 225-pound halfback
loose on a nice grass field full of j
belligerent young men and not have 1
someone hurt.

If you have been at Stanford i
for three or four years, and have
watched the awfull exhibitions
that most of our freshman teams
have turned in in practically all
sports, just go out to the sta- j
dium one of these week-ends
when the present crop of foot
ball players is in action and
have a real pleasant afternoon.
They aren't as smooth as the var
sity, and they aren't quile so de
ceptive, and they aren't quite so
big, but for a frosh team they are
all there. To a man they bear no j
resemblance to the frosh of yester- j
day who are the varsity of today. |
They are so much better that it is !
laughable.
There are four halfbacks that :
would make any coach jealous, j
Grayson is the most famous, Reis- j
ner is the most underrated, Bron- i
stein is the fastest and the least ex- \
perienced, and Hamilton is the mostj
polished. He kicks, he runs, he tac- j
kles, and he blocks a la Notre Dame, j
The Farm is fast becoming overrun 1
with outstanding halfbacks. And we j
love it!

If some of the young men who j
can't litul enough to do around Stan- I
ford to keep them busy, and who ;
don't go in for athletics in a com- i
pet ilive way, would come out and
try for some of the dozen-odd mana
gers' jobs that are open, the sports
would benefit, the individuals would
benefit, and Stanford would be'
worth a lot more to them.
There is nothing wrong with
being a manager. In the minor
sports you can usually play
while you are manager. The !
majors require a little more at
tention. Hut don't sit around.
Do something.
