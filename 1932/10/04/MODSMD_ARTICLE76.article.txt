# Cardinals Favored to Retain Soccer Pennant
## MALONEY KICKERS SPEND FIRST DAY IN LONG WORKOUT Maloney Drives Promising Squad For Opening Game Oct. 12 
### 
Putting the varsity soccer squad
of fifty players through the toughest
workout that lias ever featured the
opening day of the fall season,
Coach Harry. Maloney yesterday
stalled to whip liis men into shape
for the opening game ol the confer
ence season October 12 when the
Indians invade the San .lose State
College field.
The turnout yesterday was I lie
largest that lias yet greeted the
Stanford mentor on an opening day,
and with Ihe veterans who have
returned and a wealth of new ma
terial Coach Maloney is all set to
turn out his most successful team.
Although minus seven or eight
lettennen from last year's cham
pionship team, this season's squad
expects to be far stronger than the
IHIII title winners. Willi some of
the hest material seen on a fresh
man team in years now eligible for
the varsity, and enough transfers to
make every position wide open to
the hest man, there is hound to he
a strong aggregation representing
the Farm.
Judged merely on the work done
during spring practice the team
would shape up with King at goal,
llrekelhaum and branch at full,
White, Krtimbein and Kennedy at
halves, and Kncclil, Johnson, Eme
rick, Itojas, and I)etrick in the for
ward wall.
The halves are fairly well taken
care of with at least two sets of
experienced men which Maloney can
interchange at will. At fullback the
effective work of Muster Holmes,
now coaching the freshmen, is go
ing to he badly missed. His running
mate, Hrckclhaum is back hut there
is no one as yet to take his placc,
and fullbacks don't usually develop
over night. They need lots of ex
perience.
In the forward line Coach Ma
loney finds the excuse for all his
optimism. In Johnson and Hearn
lie lias two of the hardest kicking
forwards that a Stanford team has
ever been able to hoast. Either of
them can play center forward, the
key position, and the other can
keep right alongside at an inside
post.
Right along with these cogs in the
Indian attack, which has been con
spicuous for its absence in the past,
is Carl Knccht, who was kept off the
all-cynfcrcncc team last year only
because he was a sophomore. This
young man started as a very medi
ocre wing. Hut he improved so much
during the season that most of the
coaches were for placing him on the
top eleven.
It is too early to go over the new
material, which is not complete yet,
but Coach Maloney is highly satis
fied with the outlook.

opening day of the fall season,
Coach Harry. Maloney yesterday
stalled to whip liis men into shape
for the opening game ol the confer
ence season October 12 when the
Indians invade the San .lose State
College field.
The turnout yesterday was I lie
largest that lias yet greeted the
Stanford mentor on an opening day,
and with Ihe veterans who have
returned and a wealth of new ma
terial Coach Maloney is all set to
turn out his most successful team.
Although minus seven or eight
lettennen from last year's cham
pionship team, this season's squad
expects to be far stronger than the
IHIII title winners. Willi some of
the hest material seen on a fresh
man team in years now eligible for
the varsity, and enough transfers to
make every position wide open to
the hest man, there is hound to he
a strong aggregation representing
the Farm.
Judged merely on the work done
during spring practice the team
would shape up with King at goal,
llrekelhaum and branch at full,
White, Krtimbein and Kennedy at
halves, and Kncclil, Johnson, Eme
rick, Itojas, and I)etrick in the for
ward wall.
The halves are fairly well taken
care of with at least two sets of
experienced men which Maloney can
interchange at will. At fullback the
effective work of Muster Holmes,
now coaching the freshmen, is go
ing to he badly missed. His running
mate, Hrckclhaum is back hut there
is no one as yet to take his placc,
and fullbacks don't usually develop
over night. They need lots of ex
perience.
In the forward line Coach Ma
loney finds the excuse for all his
optimism. In Johnson and Hearn
lie lias two of the hardest kicking
forwards that a Stanford team has
ever been able to hoast. Either of
them can play center forward, the
key position, and the other can
keep right alongside at an inside
post.
Right along with these cogs in the
Indian attack, which has been con
spicuous for its absence in the past,
is Carl Knccht, who was kept off the
all-cynfcrcncc team last year only
because he was a sophomore. This
young man started as a very medi
ocre wing. Hut he improved so much
during the season that most of the
coaches were for placing him on the
top eleven.
It is too early to go over the new
material, which is not complete yet,
but Coach Maloney is highly satis
fied with the outlook.
