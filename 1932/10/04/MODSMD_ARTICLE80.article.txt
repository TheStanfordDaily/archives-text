# WORDS STILL FLY IN VOIDED BRONCO TOUCHDOWN AS CLIPPER FLAYS OFFICIALS

### BOB WADE 
; Back from the supposedly frigid |
' wastes of the North where they re- j
j ceivcd such a warm reception, the |
I Santa Clara Broncos yesterday went i
I immediately to work preparing for
! their invasion of the Indian reser
j vation in Palo Alto next Saturday.
J Coach Clipper Smith had nothing
| but praise for the Oregon team and
i coaches, but was rather bitter on

the subject of what he considered
the raw decision that his Broncos
got on their one touchdown. Con
sidering the fact that the crowd
thought that Santa Clara scored,
that Referee George Varnell thought
that they scored, and that the field
judge ducked out after the game, it
would seem that there might be
something in the assumption that
the boys were entitled to a little
consideration in the matter of points.
It's bad enough to have the un
der-dog rise up and bite you in the

| trousers without having him tear
| them away, too. This stuff of having j
! spot-judgment officials that one j
i team has never seen is not all that j
it might be. They have a habit of j
coming up with boots about fifty j
per cent of the time, and the other,
fifty they furnish excellent excuses
1 for the defeated party. Both results
are bad for the game and bad for
the individuals concerned.
There is nothing that one official
! can do about the decisions of an- j
, other during a football same They ]
j can't afford to give each other a j
| dressing-down either during the ,
game or afterwards, publicly. But if
incompetent, officials are hired a
I second time there is absolutely no
cxeuse for the defendant party.
With the Oregon game a thing of j
the past, Clipper is after Stanford,
j aren't set to show Pop something in
! and don't think that those boys ;
' the way of a flashy offense.
