# POLO VETERANS BRIGHTEN CARD A SQUAD LINEUP
## Gillham And Spaulding To Form Nucleus Of This Year's Redshirts 
### 
With two players of last year's j
championship team and a number '
of other highlights from the A squad |
signing up yesterday, polo prospects i
this year appear brighter than ever.
Pete Gillham and Rufus Spalding!
will form the nucleus of the Red- j
shirt outfit. Both these men werej
first-string riders on the team that j
last year numbered among its vic
tims such flashy teams as Arizona, j
Oregon State, and the San Mateo j
Rangers.
Other players from last year's Ai
squad who are again on the squad j
are Gillingham, Mayer, Melone, i
Luppen, Myers, and Robb. Six more
men will be moved up from the B
squad. These men will not be picked
until next week. Will Rogers, Jr.,
who showed up well last year as a
freshman, will not be back. Rogers j
transferred to the University of
Arizona.
Gordan Remaining
Captain Richard Gordan, coach, j
was fortunate in securing an exten- |
slon of his appointment at Stanford I
for another year. Gordan was origi- ;
nally slated to have ended his four- j
year stay here last June. Gordan]
believes that this year's team will
show up as the flashiest one in Stan
ford polo history.
'"Spalding and Gillham are first- j
rate players," the Cardinal mentor
said. "And the rest of the men from j
the A squad who are back are much j
better than the A squad was at the j
beginning of the season last year.
There are several players from the i
B squad who show a lot of promise, j
too."
No Games Listed
No games for this fall are as yet |
scheduled. At least two games with ;
peninsula teams will be played here, |
but there will be no conference j 1
games pn the list, Gordan an- i
nounced.
The 13 and C squads of last year, j
and any additional aspirants for the i
team, will meet this afternoon at j

at 3 o'clock.

Oregon State, and the San Mateo j
Rangers.
Other players from last year's Ai
squad who are again on the squad j
are Gillingham, Mayer, Melone, i
Luppen, Myers, and Robb. Six more
men will be moved up from the B
squad. These men will not be picked
until next week. Will Rogers, Jr.,
who showed up well last year as a
freshman, will not be back. Rogers j
transferred to the University of
Arizona.
Gordan Remaining
Captain Richard Gordan, coach, j
was fortunate in securing an exten- |
slon of his appointment at Stanford I
for another year. Gordan was origi- ;
nally slated to have ended his four- j
year stay here last June. Gordan]
believes that this year's team will
show up as the flashiest one in Stan
ford polo history.
'"Spalding and Gillham are first- j
rate players," the Cardinal mentor
said. "And the rest of the men from j
the A squad who are back are much j
better than the A squad was at the j
beginning of the season last year.
There are several players from the i
B squad who show a lot of promise, j
too."
No Games Listed
No games for this fall are as yet |
scheduled. At least two games with ;
peninsula teams will be played here, |
but there will be no conference j 1
games pn the list, Gordan an- i
nounced.
The 13 and C squads of last year, j
and any additional aspirants for the i
team, will meet this afternoon at j
Captain Gordan's office at the stables i
at 3 o'clock.
