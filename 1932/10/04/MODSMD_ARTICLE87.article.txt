# HOLMES GREETS CANDIDATES FOR FROSH SOCCER 11
## Ex-Varsity Star Coaching Twenty Apsirants In Fundamentals 
### 
Starting his initial season as fresh
; man soccer coach at Stanford, Bus-
I tor Holmes, three - year letterman
j and winner of the most-valuable
: player award twice, explained the
| rudiments of the game to his year
! ling knickers, sent them around the
j field in pairs to get the knack of
j dribbling the ball, and then called
;it a day. Twenty members of the
j class of '3G reported to Coach
I Holmes, but more are expected
i when the freshman football squad is
i cut, and when the Papooses get bet
j ter located in their new surround
| ings.
Although there are two or three
i experienced men included in the
! first-day group, as a whole they are
j as usual pretty green in the intri
| cate ways of handling a soccer ball,
i The first week or two will be
spent entirely on simple fundamen
tals, according to Coach Holmes, de
pending upon the aptitude shown by
his charges. Then ney will have to
i form into a team and acquire a co
| ordinated attack in the short space
| of approximately three weeks be-
I fore taking on the Berkeley Cubs in
I the first game of the Little Big Se-
I ries.
