# FROSH GRIDDERS SHOWING PROMISE IN EARLY GAMES

### Willard Bungay 
If Coach "Chuck" Wintefburn's
I freshman football players manage
i to half live up to their individual
reputations and yet perform with
the smoothness of one of the "Red
Machines" they will be a hard bunch
i to beat this year. After glancing at
i the scores of their games to date,
I one would be inclined to think that
that is precisely what has happened.
Perhaps the most outstanding man
| on the squad, at least the one who,
■ has been publicized the most, is Bob
; Grayson of Portland. While in high
! school at the Rose City, he won
j about every football honor possible'
I and tied the all-time scoring record |
! of Portland.
Another halfback who will have j
\ ample opportunity to display his
football wares in behalf of Stanford
is Bob Hamilton of Kiski prep;
j school, Pennsylvania. He is one of
\ the smoothest players on the squad
j and a great prospective back.

• The biggest man on ihe squad is
Bob Reynolds, former all-Oklahoma
I tackle from Okulmugee. lie weighs
j 215 pounds and is one of the rea
sons why opposing teams find it so
difficult to penetrate the Papoose
j defense.
"As good a lineman as we have"
is the way his coach described
Larry Rouble, a guard from Lowell
high school in San Francisco. The
, other guard is also from San Fran
cisco. He is "Woody" Adams and he
hails from Balboa. The center, Bob
Roth, is a former Commerce player,
as is Johnny Reisner, who is mak
-1 ing Grayson step some for his half
back position.
Frank Alustiza, all Joaquin val
: ley fullback from Stockton, is a very
good quick kicker and passer. He
: doesn't hit the line quite as hard
: as a Stanford fullback should, but
will develop into one of the best
I players on the squad.
