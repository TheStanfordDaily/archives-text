## 
### 
STOCKHOLM, Oct. 4. (/P)—Two
of the world's most glorious figures
—Greta Garbo and the Prince of
Wales—almost met yesterday after
noon in a Turkish bath.
They happened to be in the place
at the same time, but. there was no
meeting, even though a Stockholm
newspaper did print an elaborate
account, with imaginary details, of
their introduction.
Miss Garbo, her European man
ager said, is as retiring as ever.
Even his efforts failed when he tried
to get her to dine at one of the
large restaurants when the British
heir and his brother, Prince George,
were there. She is refusing all in
vitations which would involve her
appearance in public.
