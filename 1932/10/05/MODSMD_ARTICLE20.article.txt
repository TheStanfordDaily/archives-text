# 3193 REGISTER ON FOURTH DAY
## 
### 
Registration for the autumn quar- j
jter reached 3193 yesterday, the I
fourth day of enrollment, represent- j
ing an increase of 26 students over j
Monday's total, according to latest
figures released from the registrar's
office.
That the rate of registration is con- ;
siderably slower for various reasons j
than that of last year is shown by
i the fact that 1932 figures to date fall
1325 behind those of the fourth day
! of the 1931 autumn quarter, the to-!
j tal then being 3518. The nearest!
j "low" comparable to this year's de-!
cline was reached in the 1926-27'
period when total registration for
the quarter was 3318.
As the majority of students ex
pected to register have signed up. |
[the total enrollment is sure to be
j felow that of 1931.
