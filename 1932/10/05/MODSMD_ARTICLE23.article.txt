Novices at the legal profession
average an annual income of only
$978 during their first year of prac
tice at the bar of justice, it is re
vealed in a survey made during the
last nine months by James E. Bren
ner, librarian of the Stanford law
school.
Reported to an annual convention
jof the California State Bar Asso
| ciation held recently in San Diego,
j Brenner's .survey showed that young
| attorneys net about $1(500 in their
I second year of practice and make an
j average increase to approximately
$2000 by the third year. Information
! was obtained through a question
naire sent to 1182 attorneys through
| out the state who had been admitted
jto the bar within the last three
| years.
Results of the survey, according
j to Brenner, indicate that new mem
bers of the legal profession confront
! great difficulty in securing positions
I during their first year.
Preceding the convention, a meet
[ ing of the State Bar Examiners, rep
i resentatives of the state's 23 law
j schools, and the committee on co
-1 operation between the law schools
| and the state bar, was held to con
sider problems of admission to law
i practice in California
