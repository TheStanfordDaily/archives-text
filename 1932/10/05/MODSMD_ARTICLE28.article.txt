# AN UNMARKED CROSSROAD
## 
### 
Todav is (lie clay of the momentous decision. Today is
Ihe day when Stanford's overgrown freshmen, members
of llie ill-fated ('-lass of "I}."), will gulp their lunch desserts
.*lllc 1 embark on a wild race to tiie lawyer's otlice and the
new collegiate world opened to them fraternities. Today
the glamorous ballyhoo of the Greek calls the sophomore
from 11i s slightly less colorful and nearly always more sober
life in the halls.
Disappointments will descend upon the campus in
droves today, providing the bitters in the intoxicating cock
tail which will till the cups of the better satisfied. Hut fra
ternity rushing is like war everybody gets scrouged in
tlie end. The sophomore who doesn't get the bid he desires
today will think he's had a dirty deal; so will the new
pledge, some time during his career as a fraternity man.
.Inst so with the houses. The Greeks who will frolic in the
city tonight with their ten "nuggets" will soon be con
vinced that Ihev have pledged a flock of heels after all.
The sophomore's choice today (or, more truly, last
night's choice) will be made on the basis of finances, friend
ships, and avenues open to him, but there is one funda
mental question which he should ask himself in making the
move from hall to flow. What does he want most from his
university education? If he wants to be one of the best
educated men in his field, perhaps to go Phi Bete, his
chances, generally speaking, are better in the hall. If he
seeks the ability to go into the homes of his future business
associates and conduct himself in such manner as to win
favor with the wives and daughters of those associates, his
better bet is the How.
