IT'S SWEET FREEDOM. FROSH

University mottos usually contain,
the trite and acceptable palaver I
about service, justice, scholarship, 1
hope, faith, love, charity—maybe, j
patriotism, duty, kindness, and all ;
their hoary companions. All, of I
course, very worthy sentiments; but ;
so traditional, that any vibrant sig- [
nificance they may have had has;
long since shuffled off, leaving ex- ;
celsior stuffed sacred cows.
Stanford (men and women) of '36 j
is somewhat different. We have a |
motto, here, which is not only ex
hilarating in theory but potent and i
active in fact. ''The Winds of Free
dom Are Blowing." That means that
through our corridors and over our
campus, no one, instructor or stu
dent, feels the clumsy grasp of ad- .
ministrative dogmatism about his j
intellectual wind-pipe. No one has to j
think around here "by special per
mission of the copyright owners."'

Both David Starr Jordan, spirit- j
ual father, and Leland Stanford, ma- |
terial father, of this institution !
wanted the "Farm" to be particu- ,
larly abundant in animals who could j
stand up—buck ahead—or kick back
—whenever the occasion demanded.
Anyone can eat a hamburger; it
takes real strength and courage to I
eat a steak. Fry your own intellec- ;
tual steaks and eat them even i
though the going is sort of rough, j
Anyone can be a cultural fribble and j
eat the prof's hamburgers—nicely
prepared and easy to masticate.
Our motto has particular applica- i

tion during the present political
campaign. Hoover is a Stanford
graduate. Don't vote for him on that
score. Remember that the University
is not an annex of the Republican
National Committee. Similarly, you
will find some charming professors
who are Roosevelt men. Don't let
the typically amusing Democrat
temperament dash your brains out
on the alluring rocks of Jefferson
ianism.
Thinking is such a difficult occu
pation—even poor thinking is. Get
ting out of bed at six in the morn
ing is duck soup in comparison. Re
member, frosh, the winds of free
dom are blowing—not meaningless
zephyrs—but strong winds.
The easiest thing to get and the
hardest thing to take is advice. This
well-meaning stuff will ooze up all
around you —and by sheer volume,
if not by value, will weigh you
down until your shoulder blades
look like barrel hoops. However, it's
quite fashionable to give advice and
one enjoys being fashionable at
times. No fashion has yet developed
as to the taking of advice, because
sc little is ever taken.
Yet it is peculiar that even though
the donor realizes his advice is like
so many lead window weights
tossed upon the waters, he persists
in giving advice. Advice is given to
satisfy an inner desire and is justi
fied on the grounds of helping
others. ■—Abe Mellinkoff
