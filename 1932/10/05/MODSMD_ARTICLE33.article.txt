TIIE BLONDE VENUS — At the j
Mountain View Theatre.
For all the shoutings that Holly
wood has become modernized since [
the first small studio was begun in i
an ex-stable, despite the deeper
and wider bathtubs of De Mille and I
the various quaint and further ex- :
aggerated idiocyncrasies of his fel
low directors, despite all these ultra- j
modern accomplishments, the cin- :
ema has, in one or two instances, re- j
mained in its primitive and un
cultivated state.
First, the pictures have for the j
most part clung to the three plots j
with which they began, but this is |
not nearly so disturbing as the fail- 1
ure of the industry to modernize!
one of its rnost-used departments: j
the bureau of lost ladies. The vam
pires of today are the blood-suckers !
of Theda Bara's creation, and the j
tarts are the golden-hearted and
faithful wives or sweethearts that j
they always have been.
To be sure, their skirts have'
risen and fallen, but their souls,
their integral feature, remain as un
changed as the whiskers upon a ;
bronze bust of the late Mr. Lincoln. I
The Blonde Venus is merely an- j

| other instance of a very shapely
I pair of legs gone wrong until the
last few feet of film, physically soiled
( but internally yearning for un
i darned socks and homely log fires
: away from the jaded city.
I The producers have even seen fit
: to introduce a small child to reas
i sure the public that it is not to be
j swindled out of the sunshine which
| warms, whether the lady, haggard
i and worn, goes sadly down the
; street at the finale or is received to
j her lover's understanding bosom.
OFFICE GIRL—At the New Menlo
Theatre.
The previews declared Renate
I Mueller as a glamorous new star
I discovered in '"When Congress
j Dances." After seeing "Office Girl"
! we definitely declare her to be just
I another giggling Gertie stenog.
The giggling is carried to the
1 point where it is boring. Jack Hul
! Bert makes a poor Romeo, and such
! love scenes as there are are so staged
j that they are pathetic.
Production is just about as bad,
; with stage sets painted on canvas
j back-drops and appearing as, super
| ficial as most of the acting. Owen

Nares is the one redeeming feature 1
of the show—as a bank porter and
glee club leader, he is a genuinely
amusing character, and drew laughs
from the audience.
As to the rest of the gags, well,
the other actors on the screen
laughed at them. —J.H.G.
