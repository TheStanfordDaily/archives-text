### 
Yesterday's market saw the ma
jority of leading stocks close once
again with only fractional changes,
for the most part on the upside.
Trading was confined to slightly
more than a million shares. No im
portant news came out. Grain prices
were stronger. A marked decline in
business failures was indicated by
one Service. Bonds firmed, especial
ly New York City transits.
United Aircraft maintained its
place as the most active issue on the
exchange. It has held well at around
30, which represents an advance of
400% from the low established in
May of this year.
The present market oiTers attrac
tive prices on many approved issues
if the buyer is willing to chance the
possibility of a sudden reversal in
the upturn in business, as well as
the effect on the market of a Demo
cratic victory in November. While
it is reasonable to presume that such
a victory will have a temporary
dampening result on the market, it
is unlikely that Mr. Roosevelt's suc
cess can exercise any permanent in
fluence on Wall Street. The gentle
men residing in that canyon do not
long endure the solicitations of any
political figure.
However, anent the election, it is
true that few men influential in
financial circles approve of the
Democratic choice or campaign mut
terings. Consequently, if Mr. Hoover
remains at his present position, it is
to be expected that definite returns
to that effect will sweep the market
violently upward. It may not be an
other smashing boom as was evident
in the late fall of 1928, but it will
be probably as great on a percentage
basis. Steel at 170 up 25 points is
matched by steel at 42 having a s'/a
point upturn.
There is some credence in the ru
mor that large traders await real
indications of election possibilities
before making any definite commit
ments. The Literary Digest poll is
admittedly as yet sketchy; the straw

ballots of a nationwide newspaper
chain are too obviously prejudiced
to be relied upon.
The salient point of the entire af
fair is that, should business progress
upward, no influence can retard a
rising market in the near future.

United Aircraft maintained its
place as the most active issue on the
exchange. It has held well at around
30, which represents an advance of
400% from the low established in
May of this year.
The present market oiTers attrac
tive prices on many approved issues
if the buyer is willing to chance the
possibility of a sudden reversal in
the upturn in business, as well as
the effect on the market of a Demo
cratic victory in November. While
it is reasonable to presume that such
a victory will have a temporary
dampening result on the market, it
is unlikely that Mr. Roosevelt's suc
cess can exercise any permanent in
fluence on Wall Street. The gentle
men residing in that canyon do not
long endure the solicitations of any
political figure.
However, anent the election, it is
true that few men influential in
financial circles approve of the
Democratic choice or campaign mut
terings. Consequently, if Mr. Hoover
remains at his present position, it is
to be expected that definite returns
to that effect will sweep the market
violently upward. It may not be an
other smashing boom as was evident
in the late fall of 1928, but it will
be probably as great on a percentage
basis. Steel at 170 up 25 points is
matched by steel at 42 having a s'/a
point upturn.
There is some credence in the ru
mor that large traders await real
indications of election possibilities
before making any definite commit
ments. The Literary Digest poll is
admittedly as yet sketchy; the straw

ballots of a nationwide newspaper
chain are too obviously prejudiced
to be relied upon.
The salient point of the entire af
fair is that, should business progress
upward, no influence can retard a
rising market in the near future.

Yesterday's market saw the ma
jority of leading stocks close once
again with only fractional changes,
for the most part on the upside.
Trading was confined to slightly
more than a million shares. No im
portant news came out. Grain prices
were stronger. A marked decline in
business failures was indicated by
one Service. Bonds firmed, especial
