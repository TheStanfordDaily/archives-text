# SIDELINE SLANTS..

### 
WITH THE SOCCER SEASON
barely started, and in the hope that
Ihe guilty parties will take it to
heart and perhaps live up to the
i ules of the California Intercollegiate
Soccer Conference rules, the follow
ing is offered:
1) It is against the rules to play
freshmen on the varsity team of any
member of the conference
2) It is against the rules to coach
from the sidelines, and
15) All members of the conference
are supposed lo send out eligibility
lists to the opposing teams at least
a week before they meet.
Last year the Stanford freshmen
played another yearling team which
included two members who were
admittedly not eligible for competi
tion. But since Harry Maloney was
too fine a sport to insist that they
be removed, they were allowed to
remain in the game.
Such things as this are inexcus
able on the part of any member of
the conference. They all have the
machinery to pass upon the eligi
bility of any and all players who
are to compete for them, and it is a
sad state of affairs when they have
to play ineligible men to win.
Since our remarks anent the man
ager's job now open, we have been
.showered with alternate roses and
raspberries. What we were trying
to get at was this.
DON'T SIT AROUND AND DO
NOTHING!!! If you are interested
in playing something—and you want
to make sure that you manage to
get a letter somehow —go out for
one of the minor sport jobs. If, on
the other hand, you prefer to do
only the managerial tasks, and don't
mind a good deal of competition, go
out and see the managers of the
major sports.
The soccer enrollment this year
has hit a new high at 80, yet there
are only two managers on the field,
a senior and a junior. It is a swell
chance for a couple of enterprising
sophomores to get themselves a
minor sports letter without having
to go out for physical education.
The track team, which invariably
goes East in the spring, Is bleating
lor assistants. It is work, and hard
work sometimes, but who wouldn't
work for a free trip to Philadelphia?
The baseball team, with a chance
that if it takes the pennant this year
it may go to the Orient or the
Antipodes, is also bemoaning the
dearth of sophomores with a little
ambition.
With all these opportunities to do
something, to get into the swim, it
is amazing that so many members
of the Class of '35 can be satisfied
to take "monkey-drill" once a week.

Now that Pop has finally shaved
the varsity squad down to 44 aspir
ing, perspiring behemoths, the Gray
coaches, Cuddeback and Nevers,
with Ray Dawson assisting, are be
ginning to turn an appraising eye
toward their charges.
Although there are approximately
50 men on the squad, at this writ
ing it does not look as if ihere are
as many outstanding men as there
have been in recent years., But, de
spite all this, the coaches have de
cided to change the policy pursued
heretofore.
Instead of using the opposition's
plays, the Grays will be trained
along the same lines that Pop pur
sues with the varsity, and if any
outstanding players are developed
they will be advanced to the varsity
to take the places of those who do
not do so well on the more advanced
squad.
There have been rumors to the
effect that the Grays would under
take a much more imposing sched
ule this year. Since the conference
allows only two games for the Grays
of the various institutions around
the bay region, this ' was at first
mystifying. Now it seems that our
own little cherubs will have two
scheduled games, and three or four
"scrimmages." Well, anyhow, it gives
them a lot of experience no matter
what you call it, and that's what
counts in the end.
OUR IDEA OF SOMETHING NOT
SO HARD TO TAKE is the present
lot of ex-Indian Keith Gledhill.
Having played through the Eastern
season, and grabbed off, among
other honors, the national doubles
title along with that man Vines,
Keith is about to embark from the
fair city of San Francisco with the
national champion, his recently ac
quired wife, the Van Ryns and the
Allisons, for a six months' tour of
the islands between here and Sid
ney.
Eventually this little expedition
will end up on the Riviera for the
winter season. And after that the
Davis Cup of 1933. And so on ad
infinitum.
Why don't they ever take a group
of first-class backgammon players
over to Australia on exhibition.

French families are growing smal

children mow it's only two.

Now that Pop has finally shaved
the varsity squad down to 44 aspir
ing, perspiring behemoths, the Gray
coaches, Cuddeback and Nevers,
with Ray Dawson assisting, are be
ginning to turn an appraising eye
toward their charges.
Although there are approximately
50 men on the squad, at this writ
ing it does not look as if ihere are
as many outstanding men as there
have been in recent years., But, de
spite all this, the coaches have de
cided to change the policy pursued
heretofore.
Instead of using the opposition's
plays, the Grays will be trained
along the same lines that Pop pur
sues with the varsity, and if any
outstanding players are developed
they will be advanced to the varsity
to take the places of those who do
not do so well on the more advanced
squad.
There have been rumors to the
effect that the Grays would under
take a much more imposing sched
ule this year. Since the conference
allows only two games for the Grays
of the various institutions around
the bay region, this ' was at first
mystifying. Now it seems that our
own little cherubs will have two
scheduled games, and three or four
"scrimmages." Well, anyhow, it gives
them a lot of experience no matter
what you call it, and that's what
counts in the end.
OUR IDEA OF SOMETHING NOT
SO HARD TO TAKE is the present
lot of ex-Indian Keith Gledhill.
Having played through the Eastern
season, and grabbed off, among
other honors, the national doubles
title along with that man Vines,
Keith is about to embark from the
fair city of San Francisco with the
national champion, his recently ac
quired wife, the Van Ryns and the
Allisons, for a six months' tour of
the islands between here and Sid
ney.
Eventually this little expedition
will end up on the Riviera for the
winter season. And after that the
Davis Cup of 1933. And so on ad
infinitum.
Why don't they ever take a group
of first-class backgammon players
over to Australia on exhibition.

WITH THE SOCCER SEASON
barely started, and in the hope that
Ihe guilty parties will take it to
heart and perhaps live up to the
i ules of the California Intercollegiate
Soccer Conference rules, the follow
ing is offered:
1) It is against the rules to play
freshmen on the varsity team of any
member of the conference
2) It is against the rules to coach
from the sidelines, and
15) All members of the conference
are supposed lo send out eligibility
lists to the opposing teams at least
a week before they meet.
Last year the Stanford freshmen
played another yearling team which
included two members who were
admittedly not eligible for competi
tion. But since Harry Maloney was
too fine a sport to insist that they
be removed, they were allowed to
remain in the game.
Such things as this are inexcus
able on the part of any member of
the conference. They all have the
machinery to pass upon the eligi
bility of any and all players who
are to compete for them, and it is a
sad state of affairs when they have
to play ineligible men to win.
Since our remarks anent the man
ager's job now open, we have been
.showered with alternate roses and
raspberries. What we were trying
to get at was this.
DON'T SIT AROUND AND DO
NOTHING!!! If you are interested
in playing something—and you want
to make sure that you manage to
get a letter somehow —go out for
one of the minor sport jobs. If, on
the other hand, you prefer to do
only the managerial tasks, and don't
mind a good deal of competition, go
out and see the managers of the
major sports.
The soccer enrollment this year
has hit a new high at 80, yet there
are only two managers on the field,
a senior and a junior. It is a swell
chance for a couple of enterprising
sophomores to get themselves a
minor sports letter without having
to go out for physical education.
The track team, which invariably
goes East in the spring, Is bleating
lor assistants. It is work, and hard
work sometimes, but who wouldn't
work for a free trip to Philadelphia?
The baseball team, with a chance
that if it takes the pennant this year
it may go to the Orient or the
Antipodes, is also bemoaning the
dearth of sophomores with a little
ambition.

French families are growing smal
ler. In 1935 the average was four
children mow it's only two.
WITH THE SOCCER SEASON
barely started, and in the hope that
Ihe guilty parties will take it to
heart and perhaps live up to the
i ules of the California Intercollegiate
Soccer Conference rules, the follow
ing is offered:
1) It is against the rules to play
freshmen on the varsity team of any
member of the conference
2) It is against the rules to coach
from the sidelines, and
15) All members of the conference
are supposed lo send out eligibility
lists to the opposing teams at least
a week before they meet.
Last year the Stanford freshmen
played another yearling team which
included two members who were
admittedly not eligible for competi
tion. But since Harry Maloney was
too fine a sport to insist that they
be removed, they were allowed to
remain in the game.
Such things as this are inexcus
able on the part of any member of
the conference. They all have the
machinery to pass upon the eligi
bility of any and all players who
are to compete for them, and it is a
sad state of affairs when they have
to play ineligible men to win.
Since our remarks anent the man
ager's job now open, we have been
.showered with alternate roses and
raspberries. What we were trying
to get at was this.
DON'T SIT AROUND AND DO
NOTHING!!! If you are interested
in playing something—and you want
to make sure that you manage to
get a letter somehow —go out for
one of the minor sport jobs. If, on
the other hand, you prefer to do
only the managerial tasks, and don't
mind a good deal of competition, go
out and see the managers of the
major sports.
The soccer enrollment this year
has hit a new high at 80, yet there
are only two managers on the field,
a senior and a junior. It is a swell
chance for a couple of enterprising
sophomores to get themselves a
minor sports letter without having
to go out for physical education.
The track team, which invariably
goes East in the spring, Is bleating
lor assistants. It is work, and hard
work sometimes, but who wouldn't
work for a free trip to Philadelphia?
The baseball team, with a chance
that if it takes the pennant this year
it may go to the Orient or the
Antipodes, is also bemoaning the
dearth of sophomores with a little
ambition.
With all these opportunities to do
something, to get into the swim, it
is amazing that so many members
of the Class of '35 can be satisfied
to take "monkey-drill" once a week.

Now that Pop has finally shaved
the varsity squad down to 44 aspir
ing, perspiring behemoths, the Gray
coaches, Cuddeback and Nevers,
with Ray Dawson assisting, are be
ginning to turn an appraising eye
toward their charges.
Although there are approximately
50 men on the squad, at this writ
ing it does not look as if ihere are
as many outstanding men as there
have been in recent years., But, de
spite all this, the coaches have de
cided to change the policy pursued
heretofore.
Instead of using the opposition's
plays, the Grays will be trained
along the same lines that Pop pur
sues with the varsity, and if any
outstanding players are developed
they will be advanced to the varsity
to take the places of those who do
not do so well on the more advanced
squad.
There have been rumors to the
effect that the Grays would under
take a much more imposing sched
ule this year. Since the conference
allows only two games for the Grays
of the various institutions around
the bay region, this ' was at first
mystifying. Now it seems that our
own little cherubs will have two
scheduled games, and three or four
"scrimmages." Well, anyhow, it gives
them a lot of experience no matter
what you call it, and that's what
counts in the end.
OUR IDEA OF SOMETHING NOT
SO HARD TO TAKE is the present
lot of ex-Indian Keith Gledhill.
Having played through the Eastern
season, and grabbed off, among
other honors, the national doubles
title along with that man Vines,
Keith is about to embark from the
fair city of San Francisco with the
national champion, his recently ac
quired wife, the Van Ryns and the
Allisons, for a six months' tour of
the islands between here and Sid
ney.
Eventually this little expedition
will end up on the Riviera for the
winter season. And after that the
Davis Cup of 1933. And so on ad
infinitum.
Why don't they ever take a group
of first-class backgammon players
over to Australia on exhibition.
