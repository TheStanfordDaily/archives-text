# Indians Work Out For Broncos
## VARSITY IN SECRET PRACTICE; MAENTZ ONLY MAN INJURED 
### 
A none-too-confident Indian foot
ball squad went through a secret
scrimmage last night as reports
drifted onto the practice field that
the Santa Clara Broncs lost last
week to a tearp that has possibili
ties of winning the coast conference
championship.
Clipper Smith's aggregation is
said to have plenty of trick plays,
spinners, and the like that would
deceive even a Warner team. Not
having an opportunity to display
this bag of tricks all season, the
Broncos may pull a few surprises
here Saturday.
Among these Bronco tricks is a
particularly effective pass that was
exposed at Eugene but ruled com
pleted beyond the end zone. Sobrero
to Slavich is the combination that
has given Santa Clara's foes so much
worry.
In the scrimmage last night War
ner found that his squad was in al
most perfect physical shape with
Bob Maentz the only man not able
to compete. Maentz of course is out
of Saturday's game, but Bill Sim
and Kenny Afflerbaugh are capable
of filling his vacancy.
