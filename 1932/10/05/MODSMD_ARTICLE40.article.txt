# Frosh Work Hard For San Mateo J.C.
## 
### 
Anticipating the toughest game
his eleven has faced this season,
Coach "Chuck" Winterburn sent his
Stanford freshman footballers thru
an afternoon of hard work on funda
mentals yesterday.
The babes bump up against the
powerful San Mateo Junior College
team, coached by Murius MacFad
den, former Oregon State star, at
noon Saturday, furnishing the pre
liminary to the Santa Clara-Stan
ford varsity battle in the stadium,
San Mateo has worlds of stuff this
season, having taken the measure
of Saint Mary's College yearlings by
a touchdown and lost by a similar
margin to the California Cubs.
It looks as if the following men
will start: Leedy and Kingsbury at
ends, Carlson and Maentz (Bob's
"little" brother) at tackles, Rouble
and Pinotti at guards, Roth at cen
ter. The backfield will probably re
main the sameâ€”Hoose, quarterback;
Grayson and Hamilton at halves, and
Alustiza at full.
