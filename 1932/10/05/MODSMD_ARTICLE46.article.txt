# Cosgrave Back To Varsity Net
## 
### 
Stanford chances of copping the
Pacific Coast tennis championship
jumped considerably yesterday with
the definite announcement that Jack
Cosgrove, last year's No. U man, will
be swinging a racquet for the In
dians again next spring.
Cosgrove was lo.st to the team
most of last season because of ill
ness, and due to other activities,
v/as unable to keep at the peak of
his game during tha time he did
play.
However, he is now in perfect
physical condition, and with two
quarters' practice ahead of him bo
fore the tournaments, in addition to
tho playing he has done this .sum
mer, he should greatly bolster the
Stanford team.
