# W.A.A. Hockey Teams Show Ragged Form
## 
### 
Ragged playing marked the first
practice game of the junior and
senior W.A.A. hockey teams yester
day afternoon. Both classes showed
a decided need for practice on
strokes, dribbling, and general team
playing.
Although eleven juniors had
signed up, only seven turned out as
compared with the full eleven sen
iors. Jeanne Millard, hockey man
ager, announces that all upper class
women interested, may still sign up.
