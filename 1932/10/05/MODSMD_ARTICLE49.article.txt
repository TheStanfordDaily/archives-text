# MALONEY GROOMS SOCCER SQUAD FOR OPENING GAME
## 
### 
Five full teams out already and
half of another one left over! With
this as a start Coach Harry Maloney
yesterday sent his charges through
a series of ten minute scrimmages
that will be the regular order of the
day for the rest of the week in pre
paration for the opening conference
game with San Jose on the Spartan
field next Wednesday.
So far there have been no selected
teams, and the varsity men have
worked together in haphazard com
binations which were intended only
to get the men in shape for the
grueling schedule of twelve con
ference games in defense of the
championship which they carried off
last year.
Commencing wit!) the practice
this afternoon on the varsity field,
Coach Maloney will send four picked
teams against each other with the
left-overs playing the fourth team
late in the afternoon. For the rest

j of the week Coach Maloney intends
jto shift his men around fast anil
i furiously in an atempt to find "4he
j strongest possible combination for
. Wednesday's opening b;ittle.
Outstanding in the long list of
i new faces that greeted the Indian
i mentor were Velarde from San Ma
| teo and Nichols from the frosh team
of '31. Velarde is a forward who
had his training under the expert
eye of Coach Francis for two years
I and he bids fair to make some of
last spring's varsity play over their
heads to retain their positions for
the opening contest.
Nichols failed to come out for
soccer last year, but looks fast and
j shifty for so early in the season.
