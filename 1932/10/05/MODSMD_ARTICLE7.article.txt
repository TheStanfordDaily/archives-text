# Lawn-Tractors Come; Campus Sheep Depart
## 
### Collier Council 
The Board of Athletic Control has
sold its sheep.
In a spectacular deal with Theo
dore Hoover, dean of the school of
engineering, B.A.C. officials have bid
a relieved goodbye to 300 campus
mutton, bringing the machine age
to its peak at Stanford.
Henceforth, turf athletic fields will
be clipped, not by attentive sheep,
but by lawn-tractors.
Whether the Hoover price rose
above the current market level of
wool and mutton, A1 Masters, gen
eral manager of the Board of Ath
letic Control, declined to reveal.
The passing of the sheep, which
marks the end of a quaint chapter
in Stanford scenics, at the same time
means a better time in the B.A.C.
treasury, Masters declared. In this
he is echoed by Sam McDonald, su
perintendent of athletic grounds and
buildings.
The band of sheep had begun to
be a problem, as its mowing opera
tions became cramped by shrubbery,
rose bushes, the aviation field, and
the recent illness of Billy McClin
tock, picturesque Scotch ancient who
has herded the sheep in Highland
style for 30 years.
Further provoked because soccer
field, diamond, and other grounds
need reseeding, so well had the
B.A.C. nibblers done their task,
Masters and McDonald agreed to
part with them forever.
The twenty-sixth and last genera
tion of campus sheep has been
moved to the Hoover sheep ranch
on the coast.
Undergraduates will miss most of
all the younger members of the
mutton tribe at the Labor Day bar
becue at the Convalescent Home.
