Pointing the way to the
advertised brand
Many a "sale" made by advertising has gone
to a competitor because the purchaser did not
know where to buy the advertised brand. Tele
phone men evolved a plan to make it easy to find.
They created a "Where to Buy It" service in
the classified telephone directory. There—beneath
the advertised trade marks — Buick, Goodrich,
RCA Victor, General Electric and many others
now list authorized local dealers. Thus telephone
men complete the chain between advertiser and
consumer—increase the effectiveness of advertis
ing — help manufacturers and dealers to increase
sales —help consumers to get what they want!
Because they apply vision to subscribers' prob
lems, Bell System men continually increase the
value of telephone service.
