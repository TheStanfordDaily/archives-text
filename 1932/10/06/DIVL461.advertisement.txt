TRUE AUTHENTIC
ENGLISH SUIT

NEW havenJ^)^
It was Roy, Ltd, of New Haven who
first introduced the real, authentic
English suit in the United States, just
sevsn years ago.
To-day, when so many poor imita
tions are being foisted upon the
market under the name of "drape"
it is important to look for the six
essential features of the authentic
model.
Our ready-to-wear suits, custom
styled by Roy, and "tailored-soft",
can hardly be told apart from the
authentic English-model suits custom
tailored by Roy, costing $75 and up.
