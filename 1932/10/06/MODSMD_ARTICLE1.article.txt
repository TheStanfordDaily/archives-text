he greeted and congratulated by their new brothers on the Row.
On account of a summer's holdover from the regular spring quarter !
rushing and the short rush period this fall the situation held more tense
ness than usual. Only 115 mfcn for whom there were bids failed to call
for them. According to O. S. Campbell, the lawyer, this was a smaller

number than in previous years.
Although the number of pledges
this year is 59 shy of last year's total,
the class is about normal on account
of the ten-man-to-a-house rule in
effect this fall for the first time.
Phi Delta Theta lead the list of
fraternities with the largest class,
signing up their full quota of sopho
mores and four juniors. Two other
houses, Alpha Delta Phi and Phi
Kappa Psi, filled the ten-man quota
but pledged no juniors. Zeta Psi
and Delta Upsilon were runners-up
with nine pledges.
Two houses pledged only one man
and another took no new men.
Fifteen junior transfers were
pledged. The Phi Delts and the
