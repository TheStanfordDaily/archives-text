# CURTIUS TELLS GERMAN VIEWS ON WAR DEBTS
## Former Statesman Flays World's Demands On Native Country 
### 
With a frankness rare in states
men and with an exactness peculiar
to his people, Dr. Julius Curtius,
former German Foreign Minister,
yesterday detailed the German
position on reparations and arma
ments to an overflowing Stanford
Assembly Hall.
Tracing the events since 1918
which led up to the Lausanne Con
ference, Curtius attacked the out
rageous demands made upon Ger
many by the victorious nations. He
said the world had been deluded by
megalomania and shocked by the
astronomical figures of what was
adjudged to be Germany's just
reparation payments.
Era of Rebuilding
The period of terrible suffering
and civil disunity in Germany fol
lowing the Versailles Treaty cul
minated in arrangements for the
Dawes Commission of 1924. Follow
ing this came an era of rebuilding
made possible largely through the
aid of American capital.
When it was ascertained four
years later that the Reich was still
suffering an unfavorable balance of
trade, revisions under the Young
Plan reduced the annuities to two
billion dollars. This was but a tem
porary settlement, and could not
stand against the depressed world
conditions of 1930.
Praises Hoover
At this point Dr. Curtius praised
the Hoover Moratorium as having
staved off the financial collapse of
the German Republic. Nevertheless,
he believes, a finis has not been
written to negotiations. He quoted
Lincoln to say that "Nothing is set
tled until it is settled right."
For the present, the speaker said,
"international co-operation and in
terrelation is the destiny of the
world." America shot !d aid, but she
â– Should have no fear that non
acceptance of the present plans will
mean the collapse of Germany.
Self Defense "Inalienable"
"Cancellation is not Germany's
alternative," said Curtius. Should
the plans fall through, more confer
ences will be the inevitable result.
Reparations must be adjusted to
meet adjusted international eco
nomics.
In conclusion Dr. Curtius clarified
the German disarmament position.
"Germany's disarmament after the
Armistice was to be only a prelude
to general disarmament," he said,
"but the highly armed states have
been grossly dilatory in meeting
their oblig.. -uns under the Versailles
Treaty.
"Self-defense," he declared, "is
the inalienable right of all nations."
