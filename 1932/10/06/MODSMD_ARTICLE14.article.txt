# Stanford Daily Member Writes Manuscript For 'Divorce in the Family'
## 
### 
Cradle of writers. The Stan
ford Daily. To a tolerant cam
pus, reading its morning news,
comes added proof of deft
journalists.
Behind the football yarns of
Maurice liapf, Daily sports
writer, lurks a mild measure
of genius. "Divorce In the
Family," Rapf's scenario for
Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer, will
show at the Varsity next week.
To Jackie Cooper, Conrad
Nagel and Lewis Stone, it
meant just another workout.
To Rapf. it meant several quar
ters' tuition at Stanford, and a
further chance to pound out
track, soccer and golf copy for
the Daily.
Sport's stall claims not all
the summer's glory. Mary Lou
James,. Windjammer, has set
Stevenson's "Child's Garden of
Verses" to music, which book
is in the hands of publishers,
scheduled for print.
