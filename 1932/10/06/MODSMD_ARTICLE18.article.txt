# Curtius' Son Suggests Typical Stanford Man
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
He looks as though he might be a
young attache of the diplomatic
corps, or a Lindbergh-type aviator,
or even a college halfback. But at
present he is simply Klaus Curtius,
son of the visiting German states
man.
Rafter-tall, perpetually smiling,
twenty-four, good-looking in a
manly way, he could pass as a typi
cal Stanford man.
Young Klaus Curtius knows his
reparations, but has also had time
fo investigate other aspects of life.
Owner of a custom-built Mercedes
("it's guaranteed to do 112 miles an
hour"), he laughed about restrictive
American laws, and admitted start
ing smoking at the age of eleven.
"But 1 smoke not now; it's a both
ersome habit."
"I really haven't had time to size
up American girls. Most of them
I've seen looked somewhat blurred

| —from trying to see America
1 through a train window. Anyhow. I
i can't compare American girls with
; those in Europe except to say that
! they scare me on both sides of the
| ocean.
"American students seem to have
! the reputation in Europe of caring
! only for a good time—for what you
1 call 'whoopee.' But I have found
[ them different, much different. They
I work almost too hard, the ones I
; have seen. Thoy do not even stop
i reading when they walk on the
; street; no wonder Americans are
| constantly being bumped into by
automobiles.
"I was surprised and delighted to
see how interested American girls
are in politics. But perhaps it would
b ; better if they got interested in
international affairs more, rather
than only advocating the repeal of
your prohibition."
