# LEADING ROLES IN NEXT FARM PLAY ASSIGNED
## Gantner, Wilson Io Head Cast; One Minor Part Still Unfilled 
### 
Climaxing an intensive period of
casting from a record number of
aspirants for roles in "Death Takes
a Holiday," Harold Helvenston last
night made announcement that the
two principal parts in the play have
been assigned.
The central character of "Death
Takes a Holiday," His Serene High
ness Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alex
andri, is to be portrayed by Vallejo
Gantner, stellar campus Thespian.
Gantner, perhaps the most promi
nent local actor, first achieved no
tice as Evelyn Arthur in "Wings
Over Europe," and followed that
part with a magnificent interpreta
tion of Peter Standish in John S.
Balderston's "Berkeley Square."
Following the latter, Gantner filled
the clerical robes of Friar Lawrence
in "Romeo and Juliet."
Wilson Cast
Virg tiia Wilson, charming young
actress, is regarded as an ideal
choice for the part of Grazia, Ihe
feminine lead opposite Prince Sirki.
Miss Wilson's interpretation of Joan,
the heroine of John Drinkwater's
"Bird in Hand," was one of the
highlights of that production, so well
liked by the Stanford audience.
The great weight of the drama of
"Death Takes a Holiday" falls on
Prince Sirki and Grazia, and it is
the story of the strange yet beauti
ful love of these two that gives the
play its unique strength and charm.
These roles were played in the suc
cessful Broad ray production by
Philip Merivah and Rose Hobart.
Minor Roles
The part of Cora, th'j maid, has
been assigned to Mildred King, who,
though without previous experience
on the Stanford stage, shows much
promise, according to the director-.
With the announcements made
last night, and the previous ones,
Barbara Collins as the Princess,
Jane Desenberg as the Duchess,
Mary Anita Loos as Alda, Howard
Joe Lawry as Corrado, the casting
of "Death Takes a Holiday" is vir
tually complete. The part of Rhoda
Fenton remains as yet unfilled, and
Helvenston announces that he is still
considering aspirants for this role.
First rehearsals will be held to
night at 8:30 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
