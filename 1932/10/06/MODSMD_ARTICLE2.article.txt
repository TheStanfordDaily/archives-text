# Police Race To Capture Kin Of Fugitive Insull
## Seek Brother Of Missing Financier In Canada 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 5 (/P).â€”By plane
and by wire the authorities of Cook
county raced today to overtake
Martin J. Insull, once partner of his
brother, Samuel Insull, in the billion
dollar Insull utility enterprises, now
a fugitive in Canada from indict
ments charging larceny and em
bezzlement.
No sooner had word reached Chi
cago that the younger brother of
Samuel Insull, indicted with him
yesterday, had left his Orilla, Ont.,
retreat on a train Toronto-bound
than the State's Attorney directed
an assistant to fly this afternoon to
Toronto and help apprehend him.
Telegrams were dispatched, mean
while, asking Insull's detention by
the Canadian officers under an em
ergency provision in the extradition
treaties, and counsel for the British
consul here promised co-operation
to the extent of the law.
At home, here, the extradition
problem became an issue between
State's Attorney John A. Swanson
and the county board, and again be
tween State's Attorney and Gover
nor. The board has refused Swan
son's request for funds to prosecute.
The governor notified the prosecu
tor there would be no extradition
warrant until the State was assured
Cook County would pay the costs.
