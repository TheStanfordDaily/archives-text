# Wickersham, '32, Presents Excellent Piano Recital
## 
### 
A tremendous ovation greeted
Lloyd Wickersham, Jr., '32, pianist,
in his first appearance on the Stan
ford campus Tuesday evening. He
was called back for two encores,
and "bravo" was shouted by enthu
siastic auditors.
Wickersham displayed excellent
technic in a program composed
largely of the works of Bach,
Beethoven, and Chopin, and loft his
hearers impressed with his able use
of the bass register and the flexi
bility of his left hand.
The artist is an engineer.
