# 33rd Birthday For Chaparral
## 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral, fifth old
est college humor magazine in the
United States, yesterday celebrated
the thirty-third anniversary of its
establishment.
The publication was started in
1899 by Bristow Adams, the first
'â– 'Old Boy." Adams is now a profes
sor at Columbia University in New
York City. It was during his regime
that the Chaparral had its office in
the corner of an Encina room.
Since then the magazine has
grown steadily both in size and in
fluence, and continues to hold a
high place in its nationwide field.
Men now prominent in letters and
art have enlivened the pages of the
Chaparral while a( Stanford. Wal
lace and Will Irwin and Bruce
Bliven first limbered their gifted
pens writing Chappie copy. Jimmy
Swinnerton, "Monk" Antrim, and
Feg Murray were frequent art con
tributors.
On April 17, 1906, the Chaparral
staff formed the Hammer and Coffin
society to guide its destinies. This
society has become a national or
ganization with Stanford as the
mother chapter.
