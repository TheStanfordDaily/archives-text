# Pop Announces New Lineup for Bronco Battle
## Doub to Open at Left End in Place of Tod, Sim to Replace Maentz at Left Halfback; Indians To Rely on Hillman's Punting 
### DICK RODDA 
A NTICIPATING the strongest and most versatile Santa Clara offense
ever to he displayed in the Stanford Stadium, Pop Warner last night
announced a lineup for Saturday's game that is probably the best de -
fensive combination to be seen 011 the Farm in several years.
Except for switches at left end and left halfback the lineup will consist
of the same eleven that started last week against Oregon State. Bill
Doub will open at left end in place of Jay Tod and Bill Sim will start at
left halfback in place of Boh Maentz, the only man 011 the squad unable

to start because of injuries.
Lineup Announced
The complete lineup follows:
Doub, left end; Colvin, right end;
Laßorde, left tackle; Grey, right
tackle; Kite, left guard; Corbus, right
guard; Bates, center; Sim, left half
back; Caddel, right halfback; Hill
man, fullback; and Campbell, quar
terback.
Pop evidently feared some of
Santa Clara's trick spinners and end
runs when he decided to start Doub
?.t end. Tod has held down this
position thus far but has shown a
weakness on defense. The balance
of the lineup has already proven
itself defensively capable and the
Bronc mentor, Clipper Smith, will
have to pull more than a few fast
ones if he expects to outfox a line
that has been trained by the one
and only "Old Fox."
New Reserves
Should the Broncs be able to
penetrate the Cardinal wall too fre
quently, Pop has some reserves who
are almost as good as the regular#.
O'Connor, Targhetta, Johnson, and
Gribben are u few of the substitute
linemen who may be given the call
Saturday. In the backfield there is
Phil Biker, perhaps ihe best de
fensive fullback on the squad. Baker
generally sees action in every game.
To prevent a recurrence of last
year's punting exhibition by Joe
Paglia, the Indians arc relying on
the toe of Jack Hillman. Jack may
not be as accurate as the Bronc,
but he has averaged nearly as great
a distance. Last year it will be re
membered Paglia kept the Cards
deep in their own territory for the
entire first half. But the Broncs did
not have such a good attack then
and could not take advantage of
gaining possession of the ball within
the Stanford 50-yard line.
Broncs Tricky
Saturday's game will unquestion
ably be the best exhibition of bril
liant football yet to be? seen this
season. The Indians will have to
turn loose with every spinner, lat
eral, and reverse available if they
expect to conquer the Broncs and
if the rumors about Santa Clara's
bag of tricks are true, the Broncs
may put on as good a show as the
Cardinals.

quently, Pop has some reserves who
are almost as good as the regular#.
O'Connor, Targhetta, Johnson, and
Gribben are u few of the substitute
linemen who may be given the call
Saturday. In the backfield there is
Phil Biker, perhaps ihe best de
fensive fullback on the squad. Baker
generally sees action in every game.
To prevent a recurrence of last
year's punting exhibition by Joe
Paglia, the Indians arc relying on
the toe of Jack Hillman. Jack may
not be as accurate as the Bronc,
but he has averaged nearly as great
a distance. Last year it will be re
membered Paglia kept the Cards
deep in their own territory for the
entire first half. But the Broncs did
not have such a good attack then
and could not take advantage of
gaining possession of the ball within
the Stanford 50-yard line.
Broncs Tricky
Saturday's game will unquestion
ably be the best exhibition of bril
liant football yet to be? seen this
season. The Indians will have to
turn loose with every spinner, lat
eral, and reverse available if they
expect to conquer the Broncs and
if the rumors about Santa Clara's
bag of tricks are true, the Broncs
may put on as good a show as the
Cardinals.
A NTICIPATING the strongest and most versatile Santa Clara offense
ever to he displayed in the Stanford Stadium, Pop Warner last night
announced a lineup for Saturday's game that is probably the best de -
fensive combination to be seen 011 the Farm in several years.
Except for switches at left end and left halfback the lineup will consist
of the same eleven that started last week against Oregon State. Bill
Doub will open at left end in place of Jay Tod and Bill Sim will start at
left halfback in place of Boh Maentz, the only man 011 the squad unable

to start because of injuries.
Lineup Announced
The complete lineup follows:
Doub, left end; Colvin, right end;
Laßorde, left tackle; Grey, right
tackle; Kite, left guard; Corbus, right
guard; Bates, center; Sim, left half
back; Caddel, right halfback; Hill
man, fullback; and Campbell, quar
terback.
Pop evidently feared some of
Santa Clara's trick spinners and end
runs when he decided to start Doub
?.t end. Tod has held down this
position thus far but has shown a
weakness on defense. The balance
of the lineup has already proven
itself defensively capable and the
Bronc mentor, Clipper Smith, will
have to pull more than a few fast
ones if he expects to outfox a line
that has been trained by the one
and only "Old Fox."
New Reserves
Should the Broncs be able to
penetrate the Cardinal wall too fre
quently, Pop has some reserves who
are almost as good as the regular#.
