It's :i long walk from Eneina to the President's mansion
<.n the liill beside Lagunita, hnt, like walking in the coin
meiuenient procession, down ihe aisle, or to the gallows,
it's one of those walks that people ordinarily lake once in
;i lifetime. Tomorrow night all new students at Stanford,
transfers as well as entering freshmen, have what will most
likely l>e their only opportunity of enjoying the hospitality
ot the I 'Diversity's head administrator, at the annual presi
dent's reception for new undergraduates.
Almost every student on the Farm has attended one of
Ihese receptions at some time or other, and all who have
will vouch for the quality of Dr. and Mrs. Swain's hospital
ity. Contrary to the expectations of many, the president's
party is never a stiff and boringly formal affair. The un
dergraduate spirit prevails, and the guests invariably enjoy
themselves with ail the abandon characteristic of any less
auspiciously sponsored informal campus dance.
New students (especially women) should not overlook
the possibilities which tomorrow evening's reception af
fords in the way of meeting the perennial Stanford social
"lions." The gentlemen of Ibis breed, in particular, will
attest to Dr. Swain's hospitality and the convenience of his
French doors. From the standpoint of these perpetual
frosh datcrs, always bluntly typical of the campus opinion,
Ibr true and traditional jolly-up has retreated from the hall
and the How, up Ihe hill, all the way to the President's
mansion.
