# THE 						CALL-BULLETIN ALREADY IN FORM "STANFORD GRAD FLEES LEGION."

### 
Emblazoned hold in a prominent spot on the front page
of last night's ('.(iU-liiillctin, that headline ran over a story
of the exploits of one Robert Young, a man who has never
been registered in this University. As though such gross
violation of the elemental requisite of anything claiming
resemblance to journalism were not enough, the bay re
gions' criterion of everything Ilcarstian colored the product
of its imagination in the following manner:
"Stanford's campus thrilled today with receipt of dis
patches from Gibraltar that a young Cardinal graduate had
< ffccled a sensational escape after serving nineteen months
in the French Foreign Legion."
This is neither the tirst nor the worst of the Call's sen
sation-seeking miscarriages that have aroused surprise and
indignation 011 this campus. It is, however, the initial indi
cation that throughout Ibis year Stanford will again have
to guard against the viciousncss of yellow journalism.
