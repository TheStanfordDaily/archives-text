# ONE-TRACK MINDS

### 
As an example of legislative stupidity Proposition on
rext month's election ballot can be ranked right near the
tup in a Held which is noted for its dullness. On the surface
ii seems like a good measure intended to regulate racing
and betting by a board of three members; however, on
turning aside the first few sticks of wood we find that well
known negro peeping out from the pile — THE HILL
WOULD ALLOW ONLY ONE TRACK TO A COUNTY!
The fathers of this brain child failed to state whether
ii was a horse, dog, human, or railroad track. Should dog
racing be permitted at Alviso, Stanford in order to hold
the Big Meet would have to remove the mechanical rabbits
from the straightaway! Or should the license be given to
the Farm, Dink and Bill would have the novel experience
of putting whippets (and we don't mean whips) through
setting up exercises.
The suspicion might well arise that the makers of
Proposition f> had never heard of any sort of track which
did not involve organized betting in which they had pos
sibly lost (?). With "righteous indignation" they blanket
all tracks. If the situation was not fundamentally so hu
morous, a few bitter tears might be shed for that long lost
ghost, democratic government. The choice of our people
were apparently a hit out of their depth, but then aren't
all politicians in this predicament most of the time?
