# FRANKELLY SPEAKING . . .
## 
### 
The Daily's hi test foundling, the financial column by i
Martin Frankel, is not as incongruous as it might seem to a
first-glance reader. Frankel's ahililv is not unknown. It is!
hard, though, for the editors to admit that training on the j
Chaparral could ever lit any one for work on an honest I
man's newspaper. He that as it may, the Daily has asked
him to write this market comment. With its special appeal ,
to the Graduate School of Business and the Keon Depart-'
ment, the Daily hopes to extend the new columnist's range
over the whole campus.
