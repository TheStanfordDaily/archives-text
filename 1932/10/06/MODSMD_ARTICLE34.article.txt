# BULL SESSION
## IT'S THE "500" AGAIN 
### 
For an innocuous contingent, the
"500" rates more publicity than any
other similar group. The more pub
licity they get, the more high-horsey
they get; and the more high-horsey
they get, the more space they rate.
If this circle continues to circle, we
can soon expect the sad day when
only the most toady of the male
sychophants will rate dates; and
where the Daily will be just one
glowing account of their sterling
character, glowing beauty, and hyp
notic personality.
Yet, realizing this, some student
(exact party unknown) persists in
attacking them on their least vul
nerable point—physical beauty; via
Campus Opinion. And another per
son, realizing that every knock is a
boost and that every boost is worth
three knocks, cannot restrain him
self from defending them.
Why do Stanford women have the
reputation of being the least ITish
women in captivity or out? The
answer is simple when we consider
who it is that gives the women their
reputation for beauty or anything
else. It's the men, of course. How
do men judge pulchritude? By the
actually comeliness of the co-eds?
By certain abstract standards of
feminine beauty? Not at all. The
gauge of loveliness is the facility
in getting dates. If the present odds
around here wejre in reserve Eng
lish, the 500 men would all be
staunch defenders of co-ed attrac
tiveness.
But no, because the odds are what
they are, and because invitations for
evenings are refused, the manly es

| timate falls. I go to the phone. I
1 beat around the bush for a few
| minutes with a few harmless and
I meaningless platitudes and finally
| blurt out the request for a date. It's
j refused. The conversation is eased
! off with some more guff; and down
' goes the receiver.
The defense mechanism is slipped
into high gear. The one who was
| turned down feels rotten. Then sud
j denly through the cloud of defeat,
j there glows a light. The femme
| wasn't so good—anyway. The idea
i clicks. The more one thinks the
j more correct one feels. Before one
stops to think, he is down in the
[ Cellar drinking a lemon-coke, and
j having his suspicions confirmed by
others in the same boat. Then, to
completely justify his conviction, he
I dates a gorgeous Palo Alto Pride,
I Berkeley Beauty, or a sweet Mills
Mirage—and his soul is salved and
I therefore his opinion of Stanford
j women affirmed.
j What is a justifiable criticism of
: the '"500" is the false sense of popu
| larity which they naturally get from
I the rush they receive from the
J campus odds in their favor. Espe
! cially is this the case with the Ari
! zona Auroras and their ilk whose
■ painful strain to be metropolitan is
agonizing to one with sensitive feel
j ings. A great number of small-town
! belles and ranch-house queens suf
i fering from an acute desire to bo'
I suddenly sophisticated; plus the lo
j cal odds are the two causes for the
; reputation of Stanford pulchritude,
j The "500" suffers but the suffering
I is partly self-inflicted.
