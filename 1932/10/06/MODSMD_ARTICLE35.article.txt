BARCAROLLE (Froelichfilm). At
the Filmarte.
This is a light and none-too-bril
liant comedy with excellent singing
as its chief attraction. Snatches of
scenes from Tannhauser and songs
from Tales of Hoffman are intro
duced, but the director had no
qualms about cutting off a song in
the middle of a line in order to
proceed with the slow story, thus
partly spoiling the best feature of
the film.
The story is the conventional one
of two men in love with the same
girl, one with honorable intentions.
The plot proceeds quietly, with oc
casional splashes of good comedy,
but in the end loses itself in a melo
dramatic and very unreal fire. Thin
as it is, it would have been suffi
cient for musical comedy, except
for the fact that it dragged too
much, and moved only in jerks.
As far as acting goes, Gustav
Gruendgens as the monocled villain
was outstanding. His quiet comedy
and complete urbanity are remini
scent of Roland Young at his best.
Gustav Froelich had little oppor
tunity to do more than stand still
and display a very sunny smile. In
the few scenes which demanded

! anything he proved excellent. Alexa
; Engstrom as the heroine had an ex
| cellent singing voice, but her acting
| was scarcely up to the standard set
by the other principles.
The high spot of the film was the !
singing of Offenbach's doll song by
Jarmila Nowotna, a German opera
singer, who was dragged into the
i picture merely for this scene. Other
opera singers took part in scenes
from Tannhauser, but were handi
capped by ridiculous makeup, bad
cutting, and rough recording.
German musical films all seem to
be suffering from mutual imitation.
; Somewhat more than a year ago
! "Two Hearts in Waltz Time" proved
! very popular with American audi
i ences; succeeding pictures have fol
lowed the pattern over-faithfully.
Always the framework is a back- i
I stage story, this being considered a
! better way of inserting songs than
; bringing them into an ordinary dia
| logue. The parts are typed and the
1 comedy does not vary. But the Ger- ,
J man films do make even the leading
| characters comic, and in this way
| are superior to American films
I which -have hopelessly romantic
leads and depend upon farce or slap- !
[stick comedy teams. â€”C.A.Z.
