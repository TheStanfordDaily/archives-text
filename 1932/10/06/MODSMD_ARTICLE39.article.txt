Hoover made a fine, conservative,
belligerent speech. The market broke
from 1-10 points, observing tradition
—after one of the President's lec
tures. Auburn thinned 10, Telephone,
Case, Tobacco, Can, Westinghouse,
Aircraft, Union Pacific and others
dieted 5 or more.
There was no bad news. Car load
ings improved. Oil situation held
Steady. Wheat was weak. Power out
put showed increase. Corn and oats
made record lows. Executives of
railroads still yell for further wage
cuts. Stock averages for the day
weie off more than five points.
The market had to absorb 3,000,000
shares. It refused the invite at pre
vious levels and had to find its
natural prices.
Any predictions for the next
month's course of prices would be
silly as picking a roulette number.
The technical rallies and dips re
fuse definite indications of future
trends. The speculative and trading
fraternity more or less governs the
market's action currently. The pub
lic when it buys purchases small
lots for investment purposes. Those
with cash reserves prefer to await
the election and take the chance of
having to pay a few points more if
Hoover goes rent free 4 years more.
For sensible investors the bond
market offers more attractive op
portunities than stocks, most of the
latter having no yield, a .small one,
or an insecure one.
The market's action over period
of last month indicates that it is
establishing a firm foundation with
which to absorb any determined
selling campaign. Investors are buy
ing at present levels in small com
mitments, whereas speculators for
the most part feel they can secure
stocks at lower levels.
Believe today's market will open
easy, having to take renewed offer
ings, then firm slightly.
