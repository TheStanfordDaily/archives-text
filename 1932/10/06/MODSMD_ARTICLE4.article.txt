# Proctor To Revise Text On Vocations This Term
## 
### 
Dr. William Martin Proctor of the
School of Education is working on
a revision of his book, "Vocations,''
which will be out early in Decem
ber. The first edition was published
in 1929 by the Houghton-Mifflin
Company.
The book is used as a text by
classes in Occupations in junior and
senior high schools and has just
been adopted by three large high
schools in New York.
The revision will make this text
the first of its kind to include the
1930 census figures on occupations.
The new edition also will have an
additional chapter on Recreation and
Amusement Vocations.
