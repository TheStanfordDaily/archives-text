FROM ONE OF OUR BIG CITY
contemporaries we cull the informa
tion th;it it would be just great if
tin B.A.C. would graduate the prices
of the seats in the stadium for ALL
the football games this fall—the fact
that they have done it for the lesser
games being considered insufficient.
One thing that our b.a.c.'s seem
to have overlooked is the fact that
so far the big games, California and
U.S.C., have turned in the crowds
without any lowering of prices. The
depression was on last year just as
much as this year, and until there
is a definite falling down in attend
ance, the B.A.C. would be throwing
dollars away for some very doubt
ful goodwill on the part of those
who would like to see the behemoths
battle but are financially unable to
do so.
The B.A.C. spent an awfully large
chunk of its savings helping Cali
fornia put over the LC.4A. meet and
the Olympic Games. At the present
time it is trying to retrench (if you
don't believe it, ask a manager!) and
giving away tickets just because
they aren't on the fifty-yard line is
not part of the retrenchment policy.
One of the things around this
campus that freshmen never seem
1o get into very much is the intra
mural competition. There is no par
ticular reason why they don't, un
less it may be that they don't know
enough about it.
Starting with football this week,
and continuing throughout the year,
there is a long succession of intra
mural sports, and there really seems
to be no reason why a number of
athletically minded youngsters from
Ihe yearling class couldn't get to
gether and go in for these mural
sports one after another as they
come around.
With a little care in the picking
of the members, so as to include as
many different kinds of ability as
possible, they should form a formid
able organization. In other words,
ternity or an eating club to get into
ternity or a neating club to get into
the mural battles, they can get out
and battle for whatever name they
choose to give their organization.
In previous years there have been
a number of different frosh repre
sentatives in various competitions,
but there has never been any defi
nite organization. How about it '36?
WHILE BROWSING AROUND
OVER LAST WEEK'S football re
turns we happened to think that
there are likely to be a lot of sad
alumni this week. What, for exam
ple, if the Santa Clara Broncos
should lose to Stanford and an en
raged Oregon Beaver rise up ancl
tear down the walls of Troy.
The first one can very easily hap
pen. These Catholic institutions
seem to have just about twice as
much fight as any of the other little
football colleges. Why, no one seems
to be sure, but nevertheless when
they gel through with an enemy
Ihat enemy knows that there has
been a war of some kind.
As for the Beaver beating the
Trojans with his tail, Howard Jones'
warriors would have to be as sleepy
as they have seemed before that
could happen, but with Schissler
threatening to quit if he loses to
Oregon, his boys will probably take
out on Troy what they failed to let
loose on Stanford last week at Port
land. R.D.W.Jr.

and continuing throughout the year,
there is a long succession of intra
mural sports, and there really seems
to be no reason why a number of
athletically minded youngsters from
Ihe yearling class couldn't get to
gether and go in for these mural
sports one after another as they
come around.
With a little care in the picking
of the members, so as to include as
many different kinds of ability as
possible, they should form a formid
able organization. In other words,
ternity or an eating club to get into
ternity or a neating club to get into
the mural battles, they can get out
and battle for whatever name they
choose to give their organization.
In previous years there have been
a number of different frosh repre
sentatives in various competitions,
but there has never been any defi
nite organization. How about it '36?
WHILE BROWSING AROUND
OVER LAST WEEK'S football re
turns we happened to think that
there are likely to be a lot of sad
alumni this week. What, for exam
ple, if the Santa Clara Broncos
should lose to Stanford and an en
raged Oregon Beaver rise up ancl
tear down the walls of Troy.
The first one can very easily hap
pen. These Catholic institutions
seem to have just about twice as
much fight as any of the other little
football colleges. Why, no one seems
to be sure, but nevertheless when
they gel through with an enemy
Ihat enemy knows that there has
been a war of some kind.
As for the Beaver beating the
Trojans with his tail, Howard Jones'
warriors would have to be as sleepy
as they have seemed before that
could happen, but with Schissler
threatening to quit if he loses to
Oregon, his boys will probably take
out on Troy what they failed to let
loose on Stanford last week at Port
land. R.D.W.Jr.
FROM ONE OF OUR BIG CITY
contemporaries we cull the informa
tion th;it it would be just great if
tin B.A.C. would graduate the prices
of the seats in the stadium for ALL
the football games this fall—the fact
that they have done it for the lesser
games being considered insufficient.
One thing that our b.a.c.'s seem
to have overlooked is the fact that
so far the big games, California and
U.S.C., have turned in the crowds
without any lowering of prices. The
depression was on last year just as
much as this year, and until there
is a definite falling down in attend
ance, the B.A.C. would be throwing
dollars away for some very doubt
ful goodwill on the part of those
who would like to see the behemoths
battle but are financially unable to
do so.
The B.A.C. spent an awfully large
chunk of its savings helping Cali
fornia put over the LC.4A. meet and
the Olympic Games. At the present
time it is trying to retrench (if you
don't believe it, ask a manager!) and
giving away tickets just because
they aren't on the fifty-yard line is
not part of the retrenchment policy.
One of the things around this
campus that freshmen never seem
1o get into very much is the intra
mural competition. There is no par
ticular reason why they don't, un
less it may be that they don't know
enough about it.
