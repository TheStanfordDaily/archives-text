# SOCCER PRACTICE BEGINS; BALONEY CHOOSES LINEUPS
## Coach Anticipates Eleven Stronger Than Last Year's Winner 
### Bob Wade 
Picking tentative lineups for the
first time this season, Coach Harry
Maloney yesterday sent his men
through their first twenty-minute
workout of the season, pitting the
first two teams against each other,
and then following with the third
and fourth outfits at rapid intervals.
Numbered among the members of
the first eleven were five sopho
mores from last year's strong fresh
man team, and four lettermen. De
spite the number of second-year
men, Coach Maloney is expecting
an even stronger aggregation than
the one that carried off the flag last
year.
King at Goal
At goal is Jack King, who showed
up well in spring practice even
though he has had no varsity ex
perience. The fullbacks are Branch,
from the freshmen, and Brekel
baum, veteran of two years on the
varsity, who may yet be shifted to
his freshman position of goalie.
Halfbacks arc the veteran Alex
Spoehr and two sophomore stars,
Waddy White and Doug Kennedy.
In the forward line are Dodington,
from last year's scrubs, Rojas, from
the freshmen, Hearn and Knecht of
last year's team, and Cy Johnson,
who was kept out by ineligibility
during the 190 l season.
Hearn at Center
Although there is always the
chance that some unknown star will
arise and displace a regular, there
are only two real problems facing
the veteran coach. In Hearn and
Johnson, he has two of the hardest
kicking forwards ever to show in
conference competition, and he is at
present puzzled over the center for
ward position. For the first week,
at least, the more experienced Hearn
will hold down the center of the
line, but another five days may
make a change necessary.
On his B squad Coach Maloney
has placed Newman, goalie, Steele
and McShea, fullbacks, Krumbein,
Washburn and Hitchcock, halves,
Detrick, Emerick, Velarde, Viguie,
and Roos in the forward line.
Sophomores Strong
Newman, Steele, and Emerick are
all from the sophomore group that
is expected to keep the conference
crown around the Farm for the next
three seasons. Velarde is San Mateo
Junior College's current contribu
tion to Stanford soccer, and the rest
have had at least a year on the
scrubs. Washburn was the star of
the 1929 freshman team, but since
then has failed to show the im
provement that his yearling per
formance forecast.
Krumbein and McShea are both
seniors who have been out for only
a year, but should see a lot of ac
tion before the season is over. They
are big and fast, and should both
turn into excellent backfield men.

Krumbein and McShea are both
seniors who have been out for only
a year, but should see a lot of ac
tion before the season is over. They
are big and fast, and should both
turn into excellent backfield men.
Picking tentative lineups for the
first time this season, Coach Harry
Maloney yesterday sent his men
through their first twenty-minute
workout of the season, pitting the
first two teams against each other,
and then following with the third
and fourth outfits at rapid intervals.
Numbered among the members of
the first eleven were five sopho
mores from last year's strong fresh
man team, and four lettermen. De
spite the number of second-year
men, Coach Maloney is expecting
an even stronger aggregation than
the one that carried off the flag last
year.
King at Goal
At goal is Jack King, who showed
up well in spring practice even
though he has had no varsity ex
perience. The fullbacks are Branch,
from the freshmen, and Brekel
baum, veteran of two years on the
varsity, who may yet be shifted to
his freshman position of goalie.
Halfbacks arc the veteran Alex
Spoehr and two sophomore stars,
Waddy White and Doug Kennedy.
In the forward line are Dodington,
from last year's scrubs, Rojas, from
the freshmen, Hearn and Knecht of
last year's team, and Cy Johnson,
who was kept out by ineligibility
during the 190 l season.
Hearn at Center
Although there is always the
chance that some unknown star will
arise and displace a regular, there
are only two real problems facing
the veteran coach. In Hearn and
Johnson, he has two of the hardest
kicking forwards ever to show in
conference competition, and he is at
present puzzled over the center for
ward position. For the first week,
at least, the more experienced Hearn
will hold down the center of the
line, but another five days may
make a change necessary.
On his B squad Coach Maloney
has placed Newman, goalie, Steele
and McShea, fullbacks, Krumbein,
Washburn and Hitchcock, halves,
Detrick, Emerick, Velarde, Viguie,
and Roos in the forward line.
Sophomores Strong
Newman, Steele, and Emerick are
all from the sophomore group that
is expected to keep the conference
crown around the Farm for the next
three seasons. Velarde is San Mateo
Junior College's current contribu
tion to Stanford soccer, and the rest
have had at least a year on the
scrubs. Washburn was the star of
the 1929 freshman team, but since
then has failed to show the im
provement that his yearling per
formance forecast.
