# Stanford Light System Tested For Efficiency
## Photometers Installed For Efficiency Service 
### 
Stanford's lighting system in class- j
rooms, libraries, and halls may be j
remodeled as a result of an illu- :
mination survey completed during!
the summer by William Armstrong, j
graduate student in the School of
Engineering.
Using the new illumination labor
atory constructed last spring quar
ter in the electrical engineering de
partment, Armstrong tested the ef
ficiency of various types of lighting
fixtures, those now in use in the j
University as well as others.
During the summer the former i
high-voltage laboratory across from j
the Press Building was made into a j
new and larger illumination labora- I
tory. A spherical photometer 1201
inches—lo feet—in diameter has j
been constructed for use in testing |
the eflicicncy ox lighting fixtures. I
Instruments now in the old labora- I
tory will be moved in next year, j
These include a 60-inch spherical :
photometer, a Didbin photometer j
for measuring distribution of light j
from fixtures and globes, and a 24-j
inch refiectometer for measuring re- I
flection factors of different surfaces, '
including glass.
The two laboratories will be used j
for research work during the year
by graduate students under the di
rection of Dr. L. H. Brown.
