# French Table Offering A La Carte Luncheons
## 
### 
With a la carte luncheons now
being obtainable, the French Table
met for the first time this year in
the Union yesterday noon. Accord
ing to Professor William L. Schwartz
of the Romanic Languages depart
ment, it is believed that this new
scrvice will be the means of bring
ing more people to these weekly
luncheons, the 50-cent meal in the
past having kept many students
away.
All those interested in conversa
tional French are urged to attend
these gatherings.
