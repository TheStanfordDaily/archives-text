At the Santa Clara game tomor
row Stanford rooters will hear and

Mrs. Kelly, of the faculty, rind re
hearsed by the glee club and choir,
will be introduced by the glee club
between the halves. The band will
play the accompaniment.
Learn These Words
Fair Alma Mater, thy glory
we sing;
Throughout (lie land thy
praises ring;
Gladly we pledge endless
loyalty,
Stanford, to thee.
Praising thy name, our
voices we raise,
Faithful and true through
out all our days;
Unto the end we shall loyal
be,
Stanford to thee.
Rooters are asked to clip the
words to the new tune and take them
to the game. The air is very easy
to follow and the band will aid the
rooting section in this. If the song
is well received official adoption
will be considered.
