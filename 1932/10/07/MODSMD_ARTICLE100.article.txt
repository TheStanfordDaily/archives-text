# Freshman Coaches Meet Yearling Net Aspirants
## 
### 
Meeting for the first time this
fall, candidates for the freshman
termis team received initial instruc- '
tions from Coaches Bugge and Lock
wood at an informal meeting at the
varsity courts yesterday.
Plans for the autumn quarter in- 1
elude a tournament to place the j
yearling aspirants, and a challenge
ladder to take care of the improve- j
merit that some of the lesser lights i
invariably show as the season gets j
older.
Although none of this year's class
have come with any great reputa
tion, John Law, Dan Clark and Bill
Hitch appear to be the pick of the 1
first year men at this time. Lav/ is j
favored to capture and keep the top !
rung on the ladder.
