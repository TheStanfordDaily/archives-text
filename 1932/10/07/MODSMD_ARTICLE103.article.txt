# Slayer Faces Insanity Count
## George Templeton Held "Model Youth" 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. C
Convicted for lir.st degree murder,
George Douglas Templeton, Jr., 20-
year-old knife slayer of his aunt,
Mrs. Lillian Babcock, laced a second
trial here todayâ€”thi3 time on his
plea of not guilty by reason of in
sanity.
The same jury which at midnight
returned the murder verdict, with a
Jile imprisonment recommendation,
was directed to return to court at
2 o'clock for the second phase of the
proceedings.
Alienists Testify
If the defense plea is sustained,
the youth will be sent to a state in
stitution for the criminally insane
instead of to San Quentin prison.
Both defense and prosecution are
expected to call alienists to testify
concerning their observations of the
self-styled "model youth.'
Templeton, who stabbed his aunt
and seriously slashed his uncle, Wil
liam Rider Babcock, as the couple
Jay in bed at Los Altos July 2(5,
heard the murder verdict without
apparent emotion.
The jury deliberated almost eight
hours before bringing in the verdict.
Killing Not Denied
During the trial, the defense did
not attempt to deny Templeton
killed his aunt. It did contend, how
ever, that he did not premeditate
murder. In the closing defense ar
gument, Elmer Jensen, attorney for
the youth, declared he "Does not
possess a malignant and abandoned
heart' but "is possessed of a diseased
mind."
The defense contends Templeton
was motivated by belief his family
had been \vronged financially by
his uncle. Major 'JJempleton and
Babcock were formerly partners in
the importing business in Manila.
