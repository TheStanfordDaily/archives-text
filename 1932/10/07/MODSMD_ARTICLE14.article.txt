# Bear Sophomores Fail To See Red As Campus Gazes On Disguised “C”

It wasn't really red paint that
covered the Big C over in
Strawberry Canyon yesterday
morning, according to Associ
ated Press dispatches. It was
more of a dirty brown, claimed
sophomores in charge of the
emblem. And besides, it's a
little early in the year—it usu
ally isn't painted red until
sometime in the week before
the Big Game.
The sophomore committee
said they suspected students of
St. Mary's, for (he Gaels meet
the Bears in Memorial Stadium
tomorrow. But St. Mary's col
ors happen to be red and blue.
It looks like the Berkeley
sophomores are in a tough spot.
