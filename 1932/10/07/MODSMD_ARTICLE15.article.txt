# BRITAIN ABANDONS EQUALITy PARLEY
## Attitude Of Powers Dooms Arms Conference 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 6. (/P)—lt was an
nounced at the foreign office this
evening that Great Britain had
postponed indefinitely its intention
to call a four-power conference on
Germany's demand for arms equal
ity.

LONDON. Oct. 6. (JP)—'The British
Government tonight stood by its
suggestion that a four-power con
ference take up the question of
Germany's demand for arms equal
ity, but it was said in official circles
that if either France or Germany
declined to participate the plan
would be dropped.
London Reports Douted
Paris reports received in London
to the effect that the British am
bassador had decided to postpone
the conference, were regarded in
official circles as a misinterpretation.
Unofficial commentators agreed the
attitude of the two powers princi
pally concerned—France and Ger
many—rendered the situation vir
tually hopeless.
Germans Ask Guarantee
No official expression of the at
titude of the French and German
Governments has been made public
here, but Germany is reported to be
willing to participate if there is a
guarantee beforehand that her con
tentions will be approved.
The French view is that such a
guarantee would render the con
ference useless before it started.
