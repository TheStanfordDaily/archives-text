# CORBUS NAMES SPONSORS FOR '32 MUD FIGHT
## Karl, Jacobson, Wilbur To Supervise Battle Of Lower Classmen 
### 
Appointment of Charles Karl,
! Dave Jacobson, and Kay Wilbur,
Encina sponsors, to supervise next
j Thursday's mud fight was an
[ nounced yesterday by Bill Corbus,
| A.S.S.U. president. Definite decision
1 of whether to hold the fight on the
l freshman or Gray football field will
'be delayed until the return of A1
i Masters, graduate manager.
Discontinued for a period of sev
eral years, the annual mud battle
was resumed last fall after a prom
ise by the Class of 1935 that it would
j be the first to abandon the custom
j ary sophomore raid on Encina.
With each class having as its ob
| jective the dumping of the greatest
j possible number of the opposition
: into the mud pits the two groups
met last year on the freshman field
with a half hour allowed for the
; struggle. After a mucky melee the
j sophomores were declared close
I victors. *
The fact that the present sopho
j more class will be set to wipe out
j the sting of last year's defeat is
j believed to be sufficient guarantee
! that this year's battle will be a
j hard-fought one.
