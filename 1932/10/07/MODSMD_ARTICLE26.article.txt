LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6. (£>)— Ernie
Carlucci, member of a Venice high
school football team, has proven
grid coaches are all wrong. Al
though coaches instruct players that
passes should be batted down, not
intercepted, in dangerous territories,
Ernie thought otherwise in a game
yesterday afternoon with Fairfax
High. He took a pass behind his goal
line and ran 103 yards to a touch
down. His team won, 7 to 0.
