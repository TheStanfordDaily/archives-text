# Indians Favored To Stop Broncs In Tough Game
## Caddel, Maentz, Paglia, and O'Donnell on Sick List as Smith and Warner Polish Rival Squads for Stanford-Santa Clara Clash 
### BOB WADE 
Ernie Caddel, Boh Maent/., Joe I'aglia, and Vin ODonnell more
or less incapacitated, with both teams promising to open their attack
with the initial note of the referee's whistle, and with tSanford favored by
10-7 odds, Santa Clara and Stanford went through their last polishes
yesterday in preparation for what promises to be the hardest-fought
battle that these two teams have staged in many a moon, when they
meet in Stanford Stadium at 2:.'<o o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

Caddel suffered a broken rib in
the Oregon State game which, al
though not very serious, is likely to
handicap hi.s individual brilliance
somewhat at a time when the Big
Red Machine can use every cylin
der.
Maentz Injured
Maentz, who was thought only
1 slightly hurt, has come up with a
| leg injury that will keep him out
| until the Big Game if not for the
rest of the season. This is a blow at
; the very heart of Pop's offense, for
I the youngster gave promise of being
one of the best ball-packers ever
' i to cavort on Stanford turf.
Santa Clara's "Diamond Joe" Pag
-1 , lia suffered an arm injury that may
\ necessitate his remaining on the
1 ! sidelines for part of the game. This
' | is the same young man who almost
. | beat the Cards single-handed last
| year by booting the ball out of
1 bounds in the coffin comer time
' j after time. Nothing but the superior
; power of the Stanford offense saved
! that tilt.
O'Donnell Back
O'Donnell is just getting back into
harness after being laid up with an
! assortment of injuries that pre
-1 j vented his working out with the rest
' of the squad, and he is therefore in
; doubtful shape to try and play a
1 full sixty-minute game of the kind
i I that he will find awaiting him to
■ ! morrow.
; Almost on the injured list is Stan
ford's tackle, Here Laborde, who
' ; had his knee twisted in scrimmage
i ; yesterday. He will be able to start.,
1 according to Dr. Roth, but if anyone
. j should happen to twist that knee in
i j the same manner again it is ex
| tremely unlikely that Laborde will
i be of much service for the rest of
I the afternoon.
Defenses Periu^-cr
A1 though both coaches are re
| ported as set to fire the offensive
"works," it is significant that they
' have both been working overtime
to perfect their defense. Seldom has
Warner been known to start stress
ing the opponent's plays as early in
1 the week as Wednesday, except a
U.S.C. or California contest. But
this week he had the varsity work
ing for half-hour stretches against
the multi reverses and spins that
Clipper Smith has taught his Colts
. | this season.
Smith has taken his own leaning
toward the Rockne system, in which
he was first trained, combined it
with Pop's own best, not counting
this season's new plays, and to this
union he has added his multi thises
j and thats.
Santa Clara Line Heavy
.; Santa Clara's line will outweigh
| the Card forwards by a number of
j pounds to the man, especially if
Smith chooses to start his new soph
! omore find, the 250-pound Spadefore,
|at left guard. Luckily for Stanford
this will bring him opposite the po
: tential All-American, Bill Corbus.
I So far this season Stanford has
improved with every game. The
Olympic Club went down 6-0. U.S.F.
fell 20-7. Last week Oregon State,
much heavier and supposedly clever,
[was spanked 27-0. Against this the
Broncs show a 12-0 defeat of Cali
fornia and a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon.
Broncs to Put Up Fight
Although beaten last Saturday,
Santa Clara came out of the game
without any serious casualties and
in just the proper frame of mind to
give the Indians a mighty tough aft
ernoon. They aren't overconfident,
but they don't expect to lose either.
Figure it out for youiself!
They are heavier in the line, they
have one of the shiftiest attacks seen
in these parts. But they are laeking
in good reserves, and they haven't
necessarily an edge ju.st because
their line is heavier. The best back
field in the world looks awfully sick
if the line fails to hold and Stan
ford has shown the greatest im
provement in its line play.
Colvin and Slavith to Shine
In left end Slavich of Santa Clara
and left end Colvin of Stanford fans
will see two of the best wingmen
on the coast. They are both adept
at catching supposedly impossible
passes. Colvin probably has the edge
on the defense. He is more experi
enced. and he is even better this
year than he was last, which is go
ing some.
Almost on a par with these two
hawks, even though he has not had
as much notice from the public is
Stanford's other starting end, Bill
Doub. When you figure that he has
displaced Jay Tod, you know that
he is good. Last season no one
thought that anybody could play
right end for the Cards this year un
less Tod didn't come back. Yet here
is Doub shoving a fighting Tod out
of the starting lineup. And when
Doub goes out the position won't
suffer a bit. They are a sweet pair
of ends! ,
Game to Test Tackles
What goes on tomorrow will go a
long way towards letting people in
on what kind of tackles Pop has for
the rest of the campaign. Laborde
and Grey have seemed to be the
most improved players on the squad.
Today ought to settle the issue!
11 you haven't any money on the
outcome, go and see a football game
that will dwarf the California-St.
Mary's game to insignificance. If you
have bet, it's your own fault. We
figure Stanford by a whisker!

Defenses Periu^-cr
A1 though both coaches are re

"works," it is significant that they
' have both been working overtime
to perfect their defense. Seldom has
Warner been known to start stress
ing the opponent's plays as early in
1 the week as Wednesday, except a
U.S.C. or California contest. But
this week he had the varsity work
ing for half-hour stretches against
the multi reverses and spins that
Clipper Smith has taught his Colts
. | this season.
Smith has taken his own leaning
toward the Rockne system, in which
he was first trained, combined it
with Pop's own best, not counting
this season's new plays, and to this
union he has added his multi thises
j and thats.
Santa Clara Line Heavy
.; Santa Clara's line will outweigh

j pounds to the man, especially if
Smith chooses to start his new soph
! omore find, the 250-pound Spadefore,
|at left guard. Luckily for Stanford
this will bring him opposite the po
: tential All-American, Bill Corbus.
I So far this season Stanford has
improved with every game. The
Olympic Club went down 6-0. U.S.F.
fell 20-7. Last week Oregon State,
much heavier and supposedly clever,
[was spanked 27-0. Against this the
Broncs show a 12-0 defeat of Cali
fornia and a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon.
Broncs to Put Up Fight
Although beaten last Saturday,
Santa Clara came out of the game
without any serious casualties and
in just the proper frame of mind to
give the Indians a mighty tough aft
ernoon. They aren't overconfident,
but they don't expect to lose either.
Figure it out for youiself!
They are heavier in the line, they
have one of the shiftiest attacks seen
in these parts. But they are laeking
in good reserves, and they haven't
necessarily an edge ju.st because
their line is heavier. The best back
field in the world looks awfully sick
if the line fails to hold and Stan
ford has shown the greatest im
provement in its line play.
Colvin and Slavith to Shine

on the defense. He is more experi
enced. and he is even better this
year than he was last, which is go
ing some.
Almost on a par with these two
hawks, even though he has not had
as much notice from the public is
Stanford's other starting end, Bill
Doub. When you figure that he has
displaced Jay Tod, you know that
he is good. Last season no one
thought that anybody could play
right end for the Cards this year un
less Tod didn't come back. Yet here
is Doub shoving a fighting Tod out
of the starting lineup. And when
Doub goes out the position won't
suffer a bit. They are a sweet pair

Broncs to Put Up Fight
Although beaten last Saturday,
Santa Clara came out of the game
without any serious casualties and
in just the proper frame of mind to
give the Indians a mighty tough aft
ernoon. They aren't overconfident,
but they don't expect to lose either.
Figure it out for youiself!
They are heavier in the line, they
have one of the shiftiest attacks seen
in these parts. But they are laeking
in good reserves, and they haven't
necessarily an edge ju.st because
their line is heavier. The best back
field in the world looks awfully sick
if the line fails to hold and Stan
ford has shown the greatest im
provement in its line play.
Colvin and Slavith to Shine
In left end Slavich of Santa Clara
and left end Colvin of Stanford fans
will see two of the best wingmen
on the coast. They are both adept
at catching supposedly impossible
passes. Colvin probably has the edge
on the defense. He is more experi
enced. and he is even better this
year than he was last, which is go
ing some.
Almost on a par with these two
hawks, even though he has not had
as much notice from the public is
Stanford's other starting end, Bill
Doub. When you figure that he has
displaced Jay Tod, you know that
he is good. Last season no one
thought that anybody could play
right end for the Cards this year un
less Tod didn't come back. Yet here
is Doub shoving a fighting Tod out
of the starting lineup. And when
Doub goes out the position won't
suffer a bit. They are a sweet pair
of ends! ,
Game to Test Tackles
What goes on tomorrow will go a
long way towards letting people in
on what kind of tackles Pop has for
the rest of the campaign. Laborde
and Grey have seemed to be the
most improved players on the squad.
Today ought to settle the issue!
11 you haven't any money on the
outcome, go and see a football game
that will dwarf the California-St.
Mary's game to insignificance. If you
have bet, it's your own fault. We
figure Stanford by a whisker!
Ernie Caddel, Boh Maent/., Joe I'aglia, and Vin ODonnell more
or less incapacitated, with both teams promising to open their attack
with the initial note of the referee's whistle, and with tSanford favored by
10-7 odds, Santa Clara and Stanford went through their last polishes
yesterday in preparation for what promises to be the hardest-fought
battle that these two teams have staged in many a moon, when they
meet in Stanford Stadium at 2:.'<o o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

Caddel suffered a broken rib in

[was spanked 27-0. Against this the
Broncs show a 12-0 defeat of Cali
fornia and a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon.
Broncs to Put Up Fight
Although beaten last Saturday,
Santa Clara came out of the game
without any serious casualties and
in just the proper frame of mind to
give the Indians a mighty tough aft
ernoon. They aren't overconfident,
but they don't expect to lose either.
Figure it out for youiself!
They are heavier in the line, they
have one of the shiftiest attacks seen
in these parts. But they are laeking
in good reserves, and they haven't
necessarily an edge ju.st because
their line is heavier. The best back
field in the world looks awfully sick
if the line fails to hold and Stan
ford has shown the greatest im
provement in its line play.
Colvin and Slavith to Shine
In left end Slavich of Santa Clara
and left end Colvin of Stanford fans
will see two of the best wingmen
on the coast. They are both adept
at catching supposedly impossible
passes. Colvin probably has the edge
on the defense. He is more experi
enced. and he is even better this
year than he was last, which is go
ing some.
Almost on a par with these two
hawks, even though he has not had
as much notice from the public is
Stanford's other starting end, Bill
Doub. When you figure that he has
displaced Jay Tod, you know that
he is good. Last season no one
thought that anybody could play
right end for the Cards this year un
less Tod didn't come back. Yet here
is Doub shoving a fighting Tod out
of the starting lineup. And when
Doub goes out the position won't
suffer a bit. They are a sweet pair
of ends! ,
Game to Test Tackles
What goes on tomorrow will go a
long way towards letting people in
on what kind of tackles Pop has for
the rest of the campaign. Laborde
and Grey have seemed to be the
most improved players on the squad.
Today ought to settle the issue!
11 you haven't any money on the
outcome, go and see a football game
that will dwarf the California-St.
Mary's game to insignificance. If you
have bet, it's your own fault. We
figure Stanford by a whisker!
