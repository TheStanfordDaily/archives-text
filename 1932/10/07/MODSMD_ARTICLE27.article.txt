# Indians Favored To Stop Broncs In Tough Game
## Caddel, Maentz, Paglia, and O'Donnell on Sick List as Smith and Warner Polish Rival Squads for Stanford-Santa Clara Clash 
### BOB WADE 
Ernie Caddel, Boh Maent/., Joe I'aglia, and Vin ODonnell more
or less incapacitated, with both teams promising to open their attack
with the initial note of the referee's whistle, and with tSanford favored by
10-7 odds, Santa Clara and Stanford went through their last polishes
yesterday in preparation for what promises to be the hardest-fought
battle that these two teams have staged in many a moon, when they
meet in Stanford Stadium at 2:.'<o o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

Caddel suffered a broken rib in
the Oregon State game which, al
though not very serious, is likely to
handicap hi.s individual brilliance
somewhat at a time when the Big
Red Machine can use every cylin
der.
Maentz Injured
Maentz, who was thought only
1 slightly hurt, has come up with a
| leg injury that will keep him out
| until the Big Game if not for the
rest of the season. This is a blow at
; the very heart of Pop's offense, for
I the youngster gave promise of being
one of the best ball-packers ever
' i to cavort on Stanford turf.
Santa Clara's "Diamond Joe" Pag
-1 , lia suffered an arm injury that may
\ necessitate his remaining on the
1 ! sidelines for part of the game. This
' | is the same young man who almost
. | beat the Cards single-handed last
| year by booting the ball out of
1 bounds in the coffin comer time
' j after time. Nothing but the superior
; power of the Stanford offense saved
! that tilt.
O'Donnell Back
O'Donnell is just getting back into
harness after being laid up with an
! assortment of injuries that pre
-1 j vented his working out with the rest
' of the squad, and he is therefore in
; doubtful shape to try and play a
1 full sixty-minute game of the kind
i I that he will find awaiting him to
■ ! morrow.
; Almost on the injured list is Stan
ford's tackle, Here Laborde, who
' ; had his knee twisted in scrimmage
i ; yesterday. He will be able to start.,
1 according to Dr. Roth, but if anyone
. j should happen to twist that knee in
i j the same manner again it is ex
| tremely unlikely that Laborde will
i be of much service for the rest of
I the afternoon.
Defenses Periu^-cr
A1 though both coaches are re
| ported as set to fire the offensive
"works," it is significant that they
' have both been working overtime
to perfect their defense. Seldom has
Warner been known to start stress
ing the opponent's plays as early in
1 the week as Wednesday, except a
U.S.C. or California contest. But
this week he had the varsity work
ing for half-hour stretches against
the multi reverses and spins that
Clipper Smith has taught his Colts
. | this season.
Smith has taken his own leaning
toward the Rockne system, in which
he was first trained, combined it
with Pop's own best, not counting
this season's new plays, and to this
union he has added his multi thises
j and thats.
Santa Clara Line Heavy
.; Santa Clara's line will outweigh
| the Card forwards by a number of
j pounds to the man, especially if
Smith chooses to start his new soph
! omore find, the 250-pound Spadefore,
|at left guard. Luckily for Stanford
this will bring him opposite the po
: tential All-American, Bill Corbus.
I So far this season Stanford has
improved with every game. The
Olympic Club went down 6-0. U.S.F.
fell 20-7. Last week Oregon State,
much heavier and supposedly clever,
[was spanked 27-0. Against this the
Broncs show a 12-0 defeat of Cali
fornia and a 7-0 defeat at the hands
of Oregon.
Broncs to Put Up Fight
Although beaten last Saturday,
Santa Clara came out of the game
