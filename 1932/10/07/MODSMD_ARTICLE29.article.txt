# “DEPRESSION” COACHING

There \v;is ;i lime when football games were won with
men and strategy in battles of brawn on the gridiron it
self. I hen, coincidental with the popularization of the
sport as the smart topic for discussion at debutante tea
parlies, the entire conception of how games are won, and
where, suffered a change. Sports writers, tired of pounding
(Mil daily reports on the condition of the star halfback's
ingrown nail, found a new element to drivel about, bally
hooed it into a popularity far outweighing its worth, and
cleverly dubbed it "psychology." "t'nderdog" immediately
took 011 a new significance in the repertoire of the sporting
scribe as a term describing the winner of any contest.
The euphony of a comparatively new scientific term
with an "ology" on the end of it held a certain fascination
for the hoi polloi, thereby increasing the popularity of
metropolitan sports pages. The public, the newspapers, and
the sports writers were having their fun, and the merry
i esult held no real harm.
No damage was done, that is, until a number of major
coaches began to take it all to heart and, through some un
happy mental process, conceived the idea that half of
( very battle is won in print before ever a cleat has dug into
the turf. Establish your team as the underdog, they now
apparently believe, and it's all over but the post-game vic
tory song.
Perhaps occasionally an underdog, the team that ordi
narily would be the weaker, has upset its rival because that
rival was over-confident. This underdog has fought harder
because il has KNOWN that light alone could win, that in
man-power and strategy it was definitely the weaker.
"Psychology," if you will, of this sort is genuine, however
seldom it wins a ball game.
I hit il is the coach who tells his team it has hardly a
( bailee when he knows that it lias a good chance, who days
before a game weeps to the press and the public that the
contest is already ;is good as lost, the coach who drums on
the subject so continually that he actually develops in his
own men a defeatist attitude that is the coach who is
working to death "psychology," as well as his chances for
championships.

There \v;is ;i lime when football games were won with
men and strategy in battles of brawn on the gridiron it
self. I hen, coincidental with the popularization of the
sport as the smart topic for discussion at debutante tea
parlies, the entire conception of how games are won, and
where, suffered a change. Sports writers, tired of pounding
(Mil daily reports on the condition of the star halfback's
ingrown nail, found a new element to drivel about, bally
hooed it into a popularity far outweighing its worth, and
cleverly dubbed it "psychology." "t'nderdog" immediately
took 011 a new significance in the repertoire of the sporting
scribe as a term describing the winner of any contest.
The euphony of a comparatively new scientific term
with an "ology" on the end of it held a certain fascination
for the hoi polloi, thereby increasing the popularity of
metropolitan sports pages. The public, the newspapers, and
the sports writers were having their fun, and the merry
i esult held no real harm.
No damage was done, that is, until a number of major
coaches began to take it all to heart and, through some un
happy mental process, conceived the idea that half of
( very battle is won in print before ever a cleat has dug into
the turf. Establish your team as the underdog, they now
apparently believe, and it's all over but the post-game vic
tory song.
Perhaps occasionally an underdog, the team that ordi
narily would be the weaker, has upset its rival because that
rival was over-confident. This underdog has fought harder
because il has KNOWN that light alone could win, that in
man-power and strategy it was definitely the weaker.
"Psychology," if you will, of this sort is genuine, however
seldom it wins a ball game.
