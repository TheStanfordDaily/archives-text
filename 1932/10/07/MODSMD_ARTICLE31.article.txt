# "ALL THAT'S FIT"

Few indeed are Hie writers hereabouts whose personal
ideas prove interesting without the conventional under
signed signature. Jhe editorial desk has been somewhat
submerged these days under a stack of anonymous leticrs,
intended by their writers for publication in the Daily's
(.ampus Opinion column. Although the Daily welcomes
editorialized contributions, none will be printed which do
not carry the full and correct names of their authors. Due
to limited space on the editorial page, short letters will
find their way into print much sooner than those of the
elongated, blurby variety. As tor content, anything within
the bounds of decency and decorum, which you will sign,
\\e will print.
