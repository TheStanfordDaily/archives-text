# BULL SESSION
## STANDARDIZATION RUN RAMPANT 
### 
When we learn day by day that ,
the ogre—uniformity—is daily de
vouring more and more of our
existence, we shudder a bit and suf
fer in silence. We read dire prophe
cies that in a hundred years we will
be so many flesh and blood robots— ;
all running blindly in prescribed j
mazes.
But once in a while, something
stands out from the general down
ward trend toward the despicable
depths of standardization that is |
particularly annoying. Particularly
revolting, like an especially small
bonnet, placed at a particularly
cocky angle, yanked down especial- |
ly far over one eye—is annoying in
the general run of insipid feminine j
headgear.
Well, the latest last straw or most j
thorny thorn is a "paddling machine"
that some Edison-gone-wrong would
like to foist on the grade schools. [
The advantage of the machine over j
the teacher's stick is a uniform [
beating for children in all schools.
The incipient Yahoo is placed in
position. The dials are turned up; |
and the beating begins. The licking
is scientific, accurate, standard. By
this method all the personality is
taken out of the punishment. That
slightly hypochondriacal art teacher 1
that most of us can remember be- I
comes just like those that were |
more human.
While not all educators will favor j
this new rebirth of Inquisitional
splendor, very few will disapprove |

i of it because it will tend to make
' beatings uniform. In fact, most of
I these demond pedagogues in their
1 great desire to make education a
cubistic god with all measurements
accurately accounted for, hold uni
formity to be the criterion—the very
J acme of perfection.
Hence the mad fawning at the
j feet of "objective" examinations. A
- true-false is accurate. No partiality
ever enters in the grading; and what
j is not stressed, the student shows no
! partiality in studying. It does not
pay to thoroughly master the im
portant and ignore relatively the un
i important. Because it is just the
insignificant, the petty, and the
: tricky that make the "best" true
i false questions.
What matter it if these objective
j exams transform even good text
books into a disconnected maze of
: isolated facts; and make the stu
j dent's mind look like a small-town
j variety store? A place teeming (at
| best) with a myriad unrelated
knicknacks—thoroughly unorganized
! —and perfectly meaningless.
But one has to admit that these
exams and their cousins in the edu
cational supply room are uniform.
What is less inspiring—easier to cor-
J rect—and more obnoxiously stand
ardized than a large group of neatly
| mimeographed true-false examina
j tions? Any idea—new or old—is met
by the most fiendish cry, "Is it
scientific?" Which word has come
! to mean, "Is it standardized?"

When we learn day by day that ,
the ogre—uniformity—is daily de
vouring more and more of our
existence, we shudder a bit and suf
fer in silence. We read dire prophe
cies that in a hundred years we will
be so many flesh and blood robots— ;
all running blindly in prescribed j
mazes.
But once in a while, something
stands out from the general down
ward trend toward the despicable
depths of standardization that is |
particularly annoying. Particularly
revolting, like an especially small
bonnet, placed at a particularly
cocky angle, yanked down especial- |
ly far over one eye—is annoying in
the general run of insipid feminine j
headgear.
Well, the latest last straw or most j
thorny thorn is a "paddling machine"
that some Edison-gone-wrong would
like to foist on the grade schools. [
The advantage of the machine over j
the teacher's stick is a uniform [
beating for children in all schools.
The incipient Yahoo is placed in
position. The dials are turned up; |
and the beating begins. The licking
is scientific, accurate, standard. By
this method all the personality is
taken out of the punishment. That
slightly hypochondriacal art teacher 1
that most of us can remember be- I
comes just like those that were |
more human.
While not all educators will favor j
this new rebirth of Inquisitional
splendor, very few will disapprove |

i of it because it will tend to make
' beatings uniform. In fact, most of
I these demond pedagogues in their
1 great desire to make education a
cubistic god with all measurements
accurately accounted for, hold uni
formity to be the criterion—the very
J acme of perfection.
