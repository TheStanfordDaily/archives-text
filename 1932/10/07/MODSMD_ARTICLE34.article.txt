NIGHT FLIGHT—By Antoine do
Saint-Euxpery, translated by Stu
art Gilbert. Century Company.
1932. (At the Palo Alto Book
Shop).
The Patagonia mail plane roars
through the night toward Buenos
Aires with its pilot. He knows that
this is his last flight—the plane will
not weather the cyclone — yet he
pushes on. Why? The answer is
what the author wishes to discover,
and cannot. Riviere, head of the
Aeropostale, observes, "Even tho
human life may be the most
precious thing on earth, we always
behave as if there were something
of higher value. . . . But what
thing?"
Riviere is the center of interest in
the novel. He has the same courage
as his pilots and a high sense of
duty also. He must be strong
enough to be unjust in his decisions
for the good of the service. He must
be a fighter for his ambitions. He
must love his men, but not let them
know it. He must be "Riviere, the
Great; Riviere the Conquerer, bear
ing his heavy load of victory."
The descriptions of the night and
the inner thoughts of the men are
poetically beautiful, written master
fully. The novel is almost entirely
introspective. It is not recommend
ed for those who require action in
their reading; but rather for. those
who can enjoy the passive beauty
of landscape. 8.0.8.
DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON—By

Ernest Hemingway. Charles Scrib
ner's Sons, New York. 1932. (At
the Stanford Bookstore.)
Ernest Hemingway goes technical
i in his new book which consists of
a series of articles on modern bull
j fighting in Spain, remarks on fellow
| authors and how literature should
I be written, a treatise on death and
i sickness, and a number of satiric
I and humorous bits, scattered about
j his most serious thoughts.
Hemingway's short, concise fic
| tion style is not used at all in this
j book; here is the antithesis of his
! usual manner—as though he had
i been revelling in the company of
j Gertrude Stein too long. The man's
| cleverness cannot fail to strike the
i reader, but its misdirection must
; appall him. In my opinion, he is
1 consistently writing down to his
i public which does not need this;
1 although he occasionally forgets his
j unique position in contemporary
j literature long enough to reveal a
rather fine ability. Belonging to the
; naturalist school, he does not utilize
; the fact that the veiled face (or
j body) is more alluring than the
i frankness of nudity, and therefore
he boldly (though not entirely with
| out apology) uses words and ex
| pressions which are not generally
I accepted in polite society. Heming
-1 way cleverly avoids heaviness in his
| descriptions by use of scathing satire
| find humor, much of it at the ex
; pense of other contemporary au
j thors.
1 In addition to Hemingway's thesis,

there are sixty-five pages of re
markable photographs. —8.0.8.
BACK STREET (Universal) — At
the Stanford Theatre.
Here is one of the finest pictures
of the year, a picture that has vir
tually everything; it is a magnifi
cently moving story, enacted by a
capable cast, and handled with the
exquisitely sensitive direction of
John M. Stahl. It is, to be sure, a
film that rrtay not be liked by all
film-goers, for it is a serious one
destined to appeal most to those
who appreciate quality in a picture.
Fannie Hurst has so far surpassed
herself in "Back Street" that even
those who generally avoid her
stories will find little to criticize.
Irene Dunne is cast as Ray
Schmidt, and John Boles as Walter
Saxel. The narrative revolves al
most exclusively around these two.
Too high praise may not be given
them. The story is so very much
that of the man and the woman,
that inferior performers would have
made the film a miserable affair.
As it is, the characters are played
with admirable restraint, and a vast
amount of sympathy.
Irene Dunne has never appeared
to better advantage. The loveliest
Victress on the screen—whoever she
is—never looked more beautiful
than Miss Dunne in at least half of
her scenes; and her voice has the
same beauty and richness that
makes Ann Harding's outstanding.
Boles, too, turns in the best per
formance of his non-singing career.
William Bakewell overacts badly in
his Big Scene, but does well when
he is in the background. Zazu Pitts,
who adds to every picture in which
she appears, is perfect, of course.
