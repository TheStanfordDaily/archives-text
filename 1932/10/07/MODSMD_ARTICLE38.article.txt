Stocks drifted listlessly after a
weak opening, closing steady. Bonds
firm. Wheat touchest lowest since
July 26th. No important news was
available.
Montgomery-Ward showed 12 per
cent sales increase, September over
August, though 1G per cent down
from same 1931. Nickel Plate may
avoid receivership.
Last Wednesday's drop probably
touched fuse to many margin ac
counts. Present market is in firm
er technical position. While many of
last two months' commitments have
been for cash, substantial margin
traders remain.
Hoover's intention to increase the
number of his speeches, and add
plenty of spice in the dubious ca
pacity of opposing statesmen, in
creasing changes of his re-election
cheered Wall Street slightly.
Roosevelt's election would have
enormous Bearish psychological ef
fect on the Market of November 9th
and immediately thereafter. That
he, his policies or his estimable ad
visors can permanently affect in
dustry or the worker, pro or con,
is ridiculous to assume. He is mere
ly a politician—not Chandu the Ma
gician. However, smoke from his
Utopian utterances reddens Wall
Street eyes, not entirely a/c bad
ventilation.
Cad-La Salle sales were reported
40 per cent more August over July.
Auto production, U.S. and Canada
16 per cent less September over Au
gust.
Believe today's market will be
fairly steady, barring important
news.
