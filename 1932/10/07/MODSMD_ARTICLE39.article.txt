The Editor, Sir:
1 wish the Stanford men would
quit crying around about not having
enough beautiful girls on their cam
pus. Of course not all of them are
! beautiful. There are a few beauti
ful ones, many pretty ones, a goodly
' number ot good-looking girls, and
numj that combine a fair degree of
1 pulchritude and good looks. Where
I can anyone find LOU. yea, even 200
beautiful girls, v. thout combing the
t United- States carefully with only
the idea of otytaininj, beauties pura
; mount? Can we expect to find more
than our share of beauty, though
beauty is inspiring, among our fe
i male associates? No, beautiful wom
j en do not come in lots of 500.
Let us turn to the possibilities
for co-ed complaint.
I have not noticed any abundance
! of "glorified American" men around
tins institution—there are not even
; 500 Appolos or Pa rises among all
; the Stanford men. So how can we
expect 500 Helens? Perhaps such
' looking brutes, many of them ex
ceedingly careless of dress, frighten
femine beauty, because "beauty be-
I gets beauty." Is there anything par
ticularly attractive, or unusually
; manly of Stanford's men? I think
! not—they are just about average as
| college men go. More credit to the
| girls, that they do not judge by
I merely disheveled exteriors, but
recognize and find the diamonds in
(he rough. Let us hope that Stan
| ford girls are not to be justly
praised for greater powers of dis-
I cernment than Stanford men.
' Finally, tins poor Senior bemoans
| the fact that apparently he is to be
| permitted to graduated with "no
memory of beautiful women." If I
j were lie I would be ashamed to
I admit that after three yea's on the
| campus I did not "rate" any better
{than that.
It is high time that the Stanford
| men stop judging the co-eds by su
| perficial beauty and look to their
j true womanly worth and aceom
i plishments, and. Stanford's women
are way above average on those
i counts, and not so poor for looks
i as many would have us believe.
