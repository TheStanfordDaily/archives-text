three to four dollars, the association
was able to provide scholarships for
twelve men and two women.

was originally formulated under Roy
Reppy, '0(5, President of the Alumni
Association during 1930-31. The
committee organized by Reppy re
ported to last year's president, John
F. Sheehan '95, and it decided last
May to raise the dues. These dues
include a subscription to the Stan
ford Illustrated Review, and the in
crease in price made possible the
setting aside into a scholarship fund
of a dollar per subscription.

persons receiving the same copy of
the Illustrated Review—were raised
from $1.50 to $2 and contributions
were solicited from life members of

combined to make the scholarships
possible.

newed their memberships, and if
the number reaches last year's 9,000,
