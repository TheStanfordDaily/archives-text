# ART GALLERY HAS DRAMA SKETCHES
## 
### 
Of interest to Stanford students is
an exhibit of sketches of stage set
tings by Harold Helvenston and
Frederick Stover now being shown
in the Art Gallery. The drawings
are for prospective plays or plays
which have been produced during
the past four years.
Included in the exhibit are two
settings for "The Sorcerer's Drum,"
written by Dan Evans, '20, and pro
duced by Harold Helvenston on the
Bohemian Grove stage in Sonoma
county on July 23. This huge stage
is in the open air under giant red
wood trees. Helvenston was forced
to use a public address system in di
recting the play.
In the other room is a collection
of watercolors by T. M. Criley of
Carmel Heights, who died not long
ago. This is the first time Criley's
complete collection has been on ex
hibition, as he painted only for
pleasure.
Criley deals in brilliant yet clear
colors. There are several paintings
of Spanish, French, and Moroccan
scenes, but most of the watercolors
are of landscapes around Carmel.
His paintings of the sea are out
standing in the exhibit, the one
called Criley Bay being perhaps the
best.
