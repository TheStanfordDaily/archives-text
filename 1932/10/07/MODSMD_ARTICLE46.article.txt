### 
PARIS, Oct. G (/P) â€”Norman H.
Davis, who has been talking with
various government officials as
America's disarmament representa
tive, leaves tomorrow for London to
engage in naval conversations with
the British.
The talks probably will be in line
with the suggestion at- Geneva that
various powers get together infor
mally for disarmament discussion.
He will talk about President Hoo
ver's proposals and doubtless about
the British suggestion for reduction
in the size of battleships.
As he explained the attitude of
the United States in a talk with
Premier Herriot, the American Gov
ernment is neutral in differences
between individual nations, but is
primarily interested in progressive
reduction of armaments.
M. Herriot has been assured that
America believes success of the dis
armament conference will ease the
political tension and have a favor
able influence on vvoi'ld business and
credit in general.
As for the Franco-German prob
lem, especially that phase of it
raised by Germany's demand for
equality in armaments, it had been
thought here that the United States
looked favorably upon the British
proposal for a four-power confer
ence to consider that issue.
In international circles there is a
growing impression that the disarm
ament conference is closely linked
with the forthcoming international
economic conference.
