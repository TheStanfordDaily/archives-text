## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 6. (/P)â€”
While San Francisco police officers,
detailed to examine Paul M. Calli
cotte's story of his purported un
witting participation in the San
Francisco Preparedness Parade ex
plosion of 1916, prepared to wind up
their investigation here today, the
Mooney Moulders Defense Commit
tee was planning to fight for further
hearing in the event the Bay City
officers decide not to return the
Portland man to San Francisco.
Captain Charles Goff expressed
himself as convinced Cailicotte
"was fooling" and Inspector Charles
Maher intimated the narrative was
marked with discrepancies after the
two had questioned him at length
yesterday concerning his assertion
j that after delivering a suit-case
! from Oakland to San Francisco he
| set it down at the corner where the
j explosion occurred a few minutes
later.
