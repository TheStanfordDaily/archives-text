LONDON, Oct. 6. (JP)â€”Lord Lyt
ton, chairman of the League of Na
tions committee which investigated
conditions in the Far East, and other
members of the League of Nations
Union executive committee today
issued a statement welcoming the
American attitude toward the ma
chinery for maintaining peace in
the world.
Their statement read in part:
"Noting that Secretary of State
Stimson's recent speech lays it clown
that the Briand-Kellogg Pact, hav
ing as its sanction 'the combined
weight of opinion of the whole
world,' necessarily implies consulta
tion among its signatories as inci
dent to unification of that opinion,
we warmly welcome the acceptance
by the American Secretary of State
of that principle."
