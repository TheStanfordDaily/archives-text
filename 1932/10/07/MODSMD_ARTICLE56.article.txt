# Illustrated Review To Appear October 13
## 
### 
With an entirely new makeup and
with a list of writers that includes
I less than the usual amount of eam
! pus talent, the Stanford Illustrated
Review will make its first appear
ance of the current school year on
Thursday, October 13. Heading the
group of interesting articles is an
! account of Indian football prospects
by Head Coach Pop Warner.
Dink Templeton, the Card track
j mentor, will review the Olympics
j with special mention of Bill Miller,
! Stanford's new Olympic champion,
j An article written last spring by
Charles J. Crary, '03, on the fra
] ternity situation will be published,
j Crary is president, of the Stanford

alumni interfraternity conference
and president of the Palo Alto Na
tional Bank.
"Aisle Seat and Arm Chair," one
of last year's features written by
Dave Lamson, will be replaced by a
column entitled "On the Campus."
Directly opposite Lamson's article
will be an "Off the Campus" fea
ture.
The new makeup calls for the
abolition of all carry-overs: all
stories will be a page or less in
length. The cover, long the least
attractive part of the Illustrated
Review, has been completely revo
lutionized and will contain a table
of contents in place of a picture.
