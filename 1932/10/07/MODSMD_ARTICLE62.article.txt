# Aerial Attack May Feature Frosh Grid Fight Tomorrow
## YEARLINGS' FINAL PRACTICE DEVOTED TO PASS WORKOUT San Mateo Junior College Coming To Farm With Powerful Team 
### Dy Dick Strouse 
Football coaching is at best a
Iragic undertaking, but occasionally
one of the men whose job it is to
turn out winning team:-; or find em
ployrm nt elsewhere, finds himself
confronted with an entirely new
pioblem. Such is the predicament
of Chuck Winterburn ol the Stan
ford frosh, who has two passers so
good that they should really both he
tossing the ball hither and yon all
the time.
However, Winterburn, who is do
ing ; fine job with the excellent ma
terial at his command and who does
not feature the downcast face and
pessimistic speech of most of his
contemporaries, has solved this deli
cate situation. He plans to let both
Boh Grayson and Frank Alustiza be
on the propelling end of the many
passes that arc to be thrown against
San Mateo Junior College, starting
at 12 o'clock Saturday morning in
the Stanford Stadium.
Passes Click
Almost all of yesterday's practice
session was devoted to a dummy
pass scrimmage. With Grayson and
Alustiza alternating in throwing the
hall and with lloos, Hamilton, Levi,
and Kingston snagging them out of
the air, the frosh first team con
nected with about half of their at
tempts even though the defense
knew what was coming.
Then, while your ardent reporter
shivered and shook in the wintry
Mast and watched the sweatered and
weaty athletes before hiin, the sec
ond team tried its luck at passing.
And luck it did not have, for the
regulars knocked down or inter
cepted every aerial essay.
After practice, while the energetic
and peppy 1936 squad was trotting
off to the showers, Winterburn an
nounced his probable lineup in an
exclusive Daily interview that was
exclusive only because no other
newspaper was represented. Levi
and Kingston, already mentioned,
will open at the ends.
Left tackle is still wide open, with
the ability of Carlson and Reynolds
too identical to allow any obvious
edge. Woody Adams, ail-San Fran
cisco high school star, and Laury
Rouble, who showed up so well in
the Glendale game, will start at the
guards.
Some Backfield!
Roth has at least temporarily won
the center position from Rosenberg j
arid Howell, and Callaway will start i
at right tackle with Maentz in re
serve. That isn't the heaviest frosh
line in Stanford history, but it's not
far from the best.
Hamilton, Grayson, Alustiza, and
Hoes will open in the backfield for
the Cards, and the only thing this
quartet can't do with a football is ]
take it away from d">o referee. They
all run; they all block; they all;
tackle; and Alustiza punts with the j
best.
San Mateo Strong
Although not much is known of
this year's San Mateo squad, last !
year's record and the lav/ of aver-

age should provide Winterburn with
plenty of competition. The Junior
Collegians were among the best in
the state in 1931. As for the law of

averages, any school with a thou
sand students and tv/o years of foot
ball competition open to all of them
has a noteworthy theoretical edge
on a freshman class of 450 from any

university. But theories don't win
football games; watch the frosh.

will open at the ends.
Left tackle is still wide open, with
the ability of Carlson and Reynolds
too identical to allow any obvious
edge. Woody Adams, ail-San Fran
cisco high school star, and Laury
Rouble, who showed up so well in
the Glendale game, will start at the
guards.
Some Backfield!
Roth has at least temporarily won
the center position from Rosenberg j
arid Howell, and Callaway will start i
at right tackle with Maentz in re
serve. That isn't the heaviest frosh
line in Stanford history, but it's not
far from the best.
Hamilton, Grayson, Alustiza, and
Hoes will open in the backfield for
the Cards, and the only thing this
quartet can't do with a football is ]
take it away from d">o referee. They
all run; they all block; they all;
tackle; and Alustiza punts with the j
best.
San Mateo Strong
Although not much is known of
this year's San Mateo squad, last !
year's record and the lav/ of aver-

age should provide Winterburn with
plenty of competition. The Junior
Collegians were among the best in
the state in 1931. As for the law of

averages, any school with a thou
sand students and tv/o years of foot
ball competition open to all of them
has a noteworthy theoretical edge
on a freshman class of 450 from any

university. But theories don't win
football games; watch the frosh.
Football coaching is at best a
Iragic undertaking, but occasionally
one of the men whose job it is to
turn out winning team:-; or find em
ployrm nt elsewhere, finds himself
confronted with an entirely new
pioblem. Such is the predicament
of Chuck Winterburn ol the Stan
ford frosh, who has two passers so
good that they should really both he
tossing the ball hither and yon all
the time.
However, Winterburn, who is do
ing ; fine job with the excellent ma
terial at his command and who does
not feature the downcast face and
pessimistic speech of most of his
contemporaries, has solved this deli
cate situation. He plans to let both
Boh Grayson and Frank Alustiza be
on the propelling end of the many
passes that arc to be thrown against
San Mateo Junior College, starting
at 12 o'clock Saturday morning in
the Stanford Stadium.
Passes Click
Almost all of yesterday's practice
session was devoted to a dummy
pass scrimmage. With Grayson and
Alustiza alternating in throwing the
hall and with lloos, Hamilton, Levi,
and Kingston snagging them out of
the air, the frosh first team con
nected with about half of their at
tempts even though the defense
knew what was coming.
Then, while your ardent reporter
shivered and shook in the wintry
Mast and watched the sweatered and
weaty athletes before hiin, the sec
ond team tried its luck at passing.
And luck it did not have, for the
regulars knocked down or inter
cepted every aerial essay.
After practice, while the energetic
and peppy 1936 squad was trotting
off to the showers, Winterburn an
nounced his probable lineup in an
exclusive Daily interview that was
exclusive only because no other
newspaper was represented. Levi
and Kingston, already mentioned,
will open at the ends.
