# Soccer Coach Calls For Large Freshman Turnout
## 
### 
With only twenty men signed up
for the freshman soccer team and
only sixteen of these practicing
daily, Coach Buster Holmes is is
suing a plea for a larger turnout.
Regular physical education credit |
is given forth 6 freshman sport, and'
at the same time the yearlings are ;
given a chance to represent their i
University in an athletic way. Those i
who play in the Big Game with the '
California frosh will be awarded i
minor sports numerals.
Coach Holmes gave his men a
slight scrimmage yesterday, using j
both defensive and offensive for-1
ward walls, the one defending the I
goal and the latter attacking. The J
men, naturally, showed their lack I
of experience, but made a salisfac- |
tory showing.
