# MAT PERFORMERS SHOW POSSIBILITY OF FORMING TEAM FOR FUTURE MEETS
## 
### 
With 23 or 24 men signed up for
wrestling, Stanford is again con
fronted with the possibility, but not
the probability, of being i-epresented
by a mat team. Last year the "team"
was actually non-existent because
it engaged in no official meets, and
to date no grappling schedule has
been arranged.
The regular all-University tour
nament will again be held during

the winter quarter. All men en-

rolled in Stanford are eligible to
compete, with the exception of those
who have won letters in wrestling
here or elsewhere.
Ted Hill, former varsity matman,
is in active charge of the wrestling
classes and attributes the dearth of
wrestlers to the absence of any
scheduled meets. Hill considers
Jake Butts, the "Kansas Cyclone,"
his best pupil. Butts, the former in
terscholastic 145-pound champion
of Kansas, is now playing football.
