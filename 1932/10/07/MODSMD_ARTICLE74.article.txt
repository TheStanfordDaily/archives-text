# Faculty Curtails Hazing At University Of Hawaii
## 
### 
All hazing at Ihe University of j
Hawaii must bo stopped according 1
1o an ultimatum issued recently by
President David L. Crawford of the
University.
This drastic action was the result
of the injury of Miss Frances Wil
son, freshman woman, who, when j
forced to dive into the shallow end I
of (he University pool, cut a deep â€¢
gash in her scalp.
After a conference with student
leaders, Crawford ordered the swim
ming tank closed. Members of the
faculty,' ; although refusing to be
quoted directly, feel that a "certain |
amount of discipline" was desireably |
maintained through hazing. Others,,
however, felt that it had degener
ated into a method of settling pet
ty quarrels.
