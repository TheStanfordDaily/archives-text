# GRID FOES CLASH IN FALL THRILLERS
## Big Ten, Southwest Squads Swing Into Action In Games Saturday 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
With Big Ten and Southwestern
Conference teams setting the pace,
the Class AA gridiron leagues make
their first serious attacks on Old
Man Dope tomorrow afternoon.
Eight of the Big Ten colleges en
ter into conference competition with
the Northwestern-Michigan battle
likely to provide the fireworks.
Northwestern downed Missouri last
week, 27-0, while Michigan was
thumping Michigan State by one
point; less. An extremely hazardous
prediction points to Northwestern
as winner. Wisconsin and lowa,
Minnesota and Purdue, and Ohio
State and Indiana will be matched
in other Big Ten battles.
THE WINNERS in capitals
NORTHWESTERN vs. Michigan
WISCONSIN vs. lowa
PURDUE vs. Minnesota
OHIO STATE vs. Indiana
NOTRE DAME vs. Haskell Indians
NEBRASKA vs. Ohio State
TEXAS vs. Missouri
CHICAGO vs. Yale
COLUMBIA vs. Princeton
TULANE vs. Georgia
RICE vs. Southern Methodist
T.C.U. vs. Arkansas
U.S.C. vs. Oregon State
OREGON vs. Washington
ST. MARY'S vs. CALIFORNIA
STANFORD vs. Santa Clara
GONZAGA vs. Idaho
WASH. STATE vs. Willamette
MONTANA vs. Carol 1
Rice Institute Strong
Long the doormat of the South
west Conference, Rice Institute of
; Houston, Texas, is now touted as
[ one of the strongest teams south of
the Mason and Dixon line. The
Owls should beat Southern Metho
dist, though the latter's failure to
score against North Texas Teachers
and Texas Tech may arouse the
Mustangs to the greatness of their
1929, 1930, and 1931 elevens, when
their "Aerial Circus" made them the
most-feared team in the South.
Intersectional interest is centered
on Chicago's game with Yale, and
unless the Elis can make a better
showing than last week when they
were held to a scoreless tie by
Bates, the New Haven team will be
beaten. There are no other big in
tersectional clashes.
Columbia and Tulanc Favored
Columbia should defeat Princeton
in the principal Eastern game, while
Georgia, beaten by Virginia Poly
last week, finds Tulane's mighty
championship array next in its path.
This game, which Tulane should
v/in, tops the Southern Conference
schedule.
Two tremendous battles loom on
the Pacific Coast: California-St.
Mary's, and Stanford-Santa Clara.
Although the Gaels are 2-1 favorites
to win, California has an even
chance of winning. The Bears will
be fighting for their life, for if they
do not win this crucial game, the
season will probably develop into
another "Poor Cal" year. Santa
Clara, also an underdog, has an ex
cellent chance of upsetting Stan
ford. <

and Texas Tech may arouse the
Mustangs to the greatness of their
1929, 1930, and 1931 elevens, when
their "Aerial Circus" made them the
most-feared team in the South.
Intersectional interest is centered
on Chicago's game with Yale, and
unless the Elis can make a better
showing than last week when they
were held to a scoreless tie by
Bates, the New Haven team will be
beaten. There are no other big in
tersectional clashes.
Columbia and Tulanc Favored
Columbia should defeat Princeton
in the principal Eastern game, while
Georgia, beaten by Virginia Poly
last week, finds Tulane's mighty
championship array next in its path.
This game, which Tulane should
v/in, tops the Southern Conference
schedule.
Two tremendous battles loom on
the Pacific Coast: California-St.
Mary's, and Stanford-Santa Clara.
Although the Gaels are 2-1 favorites
to win, California has an even
chance of winning. The Bears will
be fighting for their life, for if they
do not win this crucial game, the
season will probably develop into
another "Poor Cal" year. Santa
Clara, also an underdog, has an ex
cellent chance of upsetting Stan
ford. <
With Big Ten and Southwestern
Conference teams setting the pace,
the Class AA gridiron leagues make
their first serious attacks on Old
Man Dope tomorrow afternoon.
Eight of the Big Ten colleges en
ter into conference competition with
the Northwestern-Michigan battle
likely to provide the fireworks.
Northwestern downed Missouri last
week, 27-0, while Michigan was
thumping Michigan State by one
point; less. An extremely hazardous
prediction points to Northwestern
as winner. Wisconsin and lowa,
Minnesota and Purdue, and Ohio
State and Indiana will be matched
in other Big Ten battles.
