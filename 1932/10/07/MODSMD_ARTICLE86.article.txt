WITH THEIR ARCH RIVALS,
the Galloping Gaels from the
Moraga Valley, battling over at
Berkeley with the Bears that
S;tnta Clara has already defeat
ed. the Washington Huskies
making their Itid for fame against
Oregon, and the Stanford
crushed Beavers due for an
other at the hands of !Vlr. Jones'
Trojans, Santa Clara is making
its annual hid to enter that se
lect class—those who have heat
en California and Stanford in
the same year.
The Broncos have beaten Stanford
twice in the last five years and each 1
time they have lost to California, j
Troy has taken the powerful pair in
two seasons, Washington has taken
them one at a time, but they have j
only bowed to the same foe in one I
year twice and that to the same,
team. So if little Santa* Clara can ;
gel past the Indian sign there will j
be a number of new records for the j
statisticians.
California, after being the fa
vorite for the coast title, ac- j
cording to the southern papers,
and the runner-up, according to
the northern papers, is rapidly
losing caste.
Ingram was something new to j
California; he was something just j
exactly opposite to what they had |
had for years. And with his big blus
tering way lie managed lo get them
through a number of tough games |
featured by the battle against U.S.C.
and the victory over Stanford.
With a good deal of his materiali
back, a wealth of new recruits, and
his system fairly well established, he
was favored to put on a banner
year. The alumni were for him, still i
are for that matter, his boys were j
for him, and the future had a de
cidedly rosy hue.
But brother Ingram ran up against j
something that every son of the
Stanford Red has faced for lo
these many moons—the old injury
jinx! So far as we know there has
never been a good remedy for this
illness, and it doesn't look like In
gram is going to find one.
If California doesn't heat St.
Mary's, it will practically have
to heat Washington and Wash
ington State to have enough
confidence to face Stanford, pro- j
viding, of course, that Stanford i
doesn't take it on the nose too
many times itself.
Down in dear old L.A., Mr. Jones !
is reported still shifting his boys |
rapidly from pillar to post in a vain
endeavor to get a little power. The
Thundering Herd, it seems, is be- I
ginning to realize just how much
poosh it really had last as
well as how little it has this year. |
Now don't go quoting us to
the effect that we are going to
wipe Troy oIT the map, hut they
aren't* what they are cracked
lip to he! Naturally a team
coached by (he efficient Mr.
Jones isn't going to be any
body's pushover, hut this team
has so l'ar failed to show any
tendencies toward the mayhem
that the 11)31 edition was able to
inflict on helpless opponents.

THAT CALI F ORNI A-ST.
MARY'S GAME is likely to turn
into one of the greatest routs in
history if the Gaels arc half that
they are cracked up to be and
California is half as weak as it
is reported to he. The Gaels
have waited some time for a
chance to really settle past scores
by turning in a good, old-fash
ioned slaughter.
If the Moragans can't do it this
year, they had better get a new lo
cation, a new horseshoe, or a new
coach. They have a team that is
faster, heavier, more versatile, in
better shape both physically and
mentally, and one that is heavily
favored by even t lie bettors. All we
ctm say is: "Unless the old spirit of

I
j St. Vitus that has always been with

Troy has taken the powerful pair in

With a good deal of his materiali

his system fairly well established, he
was favored to put on a banner
year. The alumni were for him, still i
are for that matter, his boys were j
for him, and the future had a de
cidedly rosy hue.
But brother Ingram ran up against j
something that every son of the
Stanford Red has faced for lo
these many moons—the old injury
jinx! So far as we know there has
never been a good remedy for this
illness, and it doesn't look like In
gram is going to find one.
If California doesn't heat St.

to heat Washington and Wash

viding, of course, that Stanford i
doesn't take it on the nose too

confidence to face Stanford, pro- j
viding, of course, that Stanford i
doesn't take it on the nose too
many times itself.
Down in dear old L.A., Mr. Jones !
is reported still shifting his boys |
rapidly from pillar to post in a vain
endeavor to get a little power. The
Thundering Herd, it seems, is be- I
ginning to realize just how much
poosh it really had last as
well as how little it has this year. |
Now don't go quoting us to
the effect that we are going to
wipe Troy oIT the map, hut they
aren't* what they are cracked
lip to he! Naturally a team
coached by (he efficient Mr.
Jones isn't going to be any
body's pushover, hut this team
has so l'ar failed to show any
tendencies toward the mayhem
that the 11)31 edition was able to
inflict on helpless opponents.

THAT CALI F ORNI A-ST.
MARY'S GAME is likely to turn
into one of the greatest routs in
history if the Gaels arc half that
they are cracked up to be and
California is half as weak as it
is reported to he. The Gaels
have waited some time for a
chance to really settle past scores
by turning in a good, old-fash
ioned slaughter.
If the Moragans can't do it this
year, they had better get a new lo
cation, a new horseshoe, or a new
coach. They have a team that is
faster, heavier, more versatile, in
better shape both physically and
mentally, and one that is heavily
favored by even t lie bettors. All we
ctm say is: "Unless the old spirit of

I
j St. Vitus that has always been with
t the Gaels against Cul is working
S overtime tomorrow, POOR CAL!!!"
