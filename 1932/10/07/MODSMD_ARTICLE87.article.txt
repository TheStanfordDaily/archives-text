## [Not Clear] SHOOTS 79 IN FIRST ATTEMPT IN LOCAL TOURNEY Men Golfers Show Promise For Varsity Berths In Initial Rounds 
### Jay Graves 
Tom Dwyer, former Sacramento
Junior College linksman who quali
fied for the National Open two years
ago, yesterday shot his first round
in the Stanford tryouts. Dwyer re
corded a 79 which, if coupled with a
respectable score on his second 18-
hole qualifying tour of the still
crrr.pus course, should land him a
berth on the varsity golf squad.
Junior College Stars
Bill Hunting, a varsity star from
last year, played his initial round in
85. Earlier in the week Tommy Ed
wards and Harold Seheeline had
both turned in 79's and are now tied
with Dwyer.
Two Modesto Junior College stars
now attending Stanford have not yet
played their first rounds. Harold
Giddings, California junior college
champion and Dick Greer, his Mo
desto team-mat who was runner-up
for the same title, should both qual
ify for the Card team with 80's or
bette*\
Approximately fifteen freshman
golfers have also completed their
first rounds, and some eight more
have been around the course twice.
Bob Thompson, with a neat 75, leads
the frosh. Among his more noted
team-mates is Don Edwards, brother
of the varsity star who won Stan
ford's only match from U.C. last
year. Richmond Nickolas and Bob
MeGlashan are other prominent
yearling golfers.
All second-rounds in the 3G-hole
qualifying test will be completed by
tomorrow afternoon, at which time
both varsity and frosh squads will
have been temporarily chosen.
