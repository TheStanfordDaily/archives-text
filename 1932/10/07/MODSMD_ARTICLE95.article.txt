# GAELS FAVORITES! TO SCALP BEARS
## 
### 
An underrated but fighting Cali- i
fomia football squad will face the
St. Mary's Gaels in the Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley tomorrow aft- 1
ernoon in perhaps the most im- j
portant and at least the most popu- j
lar of the early season gridiron class-

The Bears will be fighting tomor- j
j row afternoon to regain the position ;
i near the top of the Pacific coast
| football ladder that they were re- |
j puted to have held a couple of weeks J
I ago before running into one Santa '
' Clara Bronco. And they will also be i
! fighting to avenge a 14 to 0 defeat
! at Ihe hand of ihe Gaels last year.
Should Bill Ingram's squad come
| through tomorrow —but the odds
i are much against them —they will
have accomplished practically the
same achievement that they did last j
year in holding the Trojans to a G to i
0 score. For Slip Madigan is said to i
have another team over at Moraga I
that is out after national honors. The j
Gaels have not as yet had an oppor- j
tunity to show just how strong they
are but by tomorrow night the foot- I
ball world will have a fairly good
idea. i
• The Gaels boast a wealth of vet- 1
j eran material plus several sopho-
I more sensations, particularlp a cer- j
j tain George Wilson, no relation to '
the Ail-American Wilson of Wash- j
i ington a few seasons ago. Wilson is J
j a second year halfback and accord- j
i ing to Slip, himself, he will be an j
! All-American this year.

To make the situation even worse
for the Bear, she will enter the game
without the services of two of her
best backfield men. Mank Schaldach
is still on the bench and Ken Mocl
ler is out for the season.
Ingram plans to meet the Gaels
offensively this year rather than to
punt and wait for the breaks. Cali
fornia's offense is nothing spectacu
lar but once it becomes inspired it
is very hard to stop. Should the
Bears play the way they did in the
last five minutee or the first five
minutes last week against the Olym
pic Club, the Gaels will be dealing
with a madder bear than they had
expected.
