tice the outlook seems none too
cheerful at present.
Long valued for its development
of future varsity stars, this year's
Gray squad will be conducted along
a slightly changed plan. Instead of

I writing until tha following year to
Ibe advanced to he varsity, players
who show enough promise will be
moved up to strengthen ihe regulars
during ihe present season.
This change means that the Grays
will spend their time working on the
same plays used by the varsity, in
stead of drilling in the formations
used by opposing school:'. Last • ea
son the reserves spent much of their
time perfecting U.S.C. plays and re
hied on them exclusively in their
