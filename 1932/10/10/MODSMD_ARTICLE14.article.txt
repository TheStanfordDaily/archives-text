i BRAWLEY, Oct. 9. (£>)— A severe
I earthquake shock, the eighth in two
i days, shook Brawley and El Centro
j at 2:45 p.m. today at the height of
j an intense rainstorm, which resulted
j in the derailment of the Southern
Pacific Golden State Limited, crack
passenger train, and damage to ir
| rigation canals.
i The earth tremor, most distinct of
! the 48-hour series, sent residents of
] the two towns rushing into the
i downpour. Insecure buildings were
I deserted for shelter in substantial
I structures.
Hobo Injured
The accident to the train, in which
i no one but an unidentified hobo
i was injured, happened at 1:30 a.m.,

i forty feet where the roadbed had
i been undermined by flood waters
| pouring down from the Chocolate
! mountains.

j proportions after the quake, at 1
i p.m. A reading by the Imperial
I valley weather bureau showed pre
! cipitation of 1.5 inches, greater than
i the entire preceding rainfall of the
