# Debye To Give Science Talks
## 
### 
Dr. Peter Debye of the University
of Leipzig, one of the world's fore
most physicists, will deliver the first
in a series of four science lectures
on the campus this afternoon at
4:15 o'clock.

Dr. Debye, who has just com
pleted the Hitchcock lectures at the
University of California, has done
more on tl.e electrical structure of
molecules than any other living
man. He is responsible for the theory
of electrolytes known as the inter
ionic attraction. He is also the au
thor of the book, "Polar Molecules."
Today's lectuic iupic, "The Struc
ture of Molecules Determined by
Cathode and X-rays," will be fol
lowed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday by "The Structure of
Liquids," "Some New Phenomena
in Electrolytes," and "Polar Proper
ties."
The lectures, to be given in Room
20 of the Chemistry Building, are
sponsored by the departments of
Chemistry, Physics, and Mathe
matics, and Sigma Xi, national
scholastic society.
