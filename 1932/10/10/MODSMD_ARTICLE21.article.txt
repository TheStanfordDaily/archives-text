# Nimble Indians Master Bronco; Cards Win 14-0
## Stanford Shows Spasmodic Offensive Power To Beat Santa Clara; Polished Defense Holds Visitors Scoreless as Bates and Doub Shine 
### ROB WADE 
TWELVE plays, twelve points, and Stanford was through for the after
noon. They scored the first six in the first 85 seconds playing time on
five plays. They scored the other sextet in seven plays which started
near the end of the third quarter and finished up before the fourth period
was well under way. The rest of the afternoon the Big Red Machine was
held even hy a valiant, fighting, but tired Santa Clara Bronco.
Stanford defeated Santa Clara 14-0 Saturday, and they did most of
the damage without the services of Ernie Caddel and Gordie Campbell.
Ernie made twenty-one yards in the two plays that he carried the ball,
and then headed for the showers with his right shoulder hanging limp.
He'll be ready for Hie Trojans in two weeks, however. Campbell turned

• s the knee that was wrecked in spring
practice, and is due for a lot of rest
j before the twenty-second.
Bates Blocks I'unt
The Indians fell on the Broncs
( before they got well started, and
| they had seven points before the
I Santa Clara team was aware ( Ihat
I the game had begun. Grey kicked
! off over the goal-line. Bates smeared
i Denser on the fiist play, and on the
j next he and Corbus broke through
; and blocked Paglia's punt on the
j two-yard line. Hillman missed once
as Maul/, stopped him, and then
went over half the Bronc line to
ring up the first score of the game.
Campbell held Ihe ball and Corbus
methodically kicked goal. Score:
! Stanford 7, Santa Clara 0.
Santa Clara had her choice and
! proceeded to show what she had
| planned originally by kicking off.
i But the Broncs didn't have the fire
that characterized their victory over
California two weeks ago. They
were great defensively, when they
kept cool. But every time Stanford
kicked to them they became too
; excited and dropped the ball.
Tricky Card Defense
Santa Clara couldn't solve Stan-
I ford's defense. It wasn't a case of
i Stanford solving their attack. The
i Cards played three, four, or five
! men on the line until they saw
j where the play was headed and then
] jumped into the line and charged
so hard that Santa Clara couldn't
get going.
Santa Clara's much-heralded
; multi this and that never had a
chance. They used a multiple spin
ner just once. They got nowhere
with their passes. They were too
well spotted. Both teams had been
j-expecting much in the air and they
were both so well informed that
there wasn't, a pass received that
managed to be of any assistance at
all when it meant a score.
Broncs Watch Colvin
| Stanford completed six out of
; sixteen passes for a gain of 50 yards.
The Broncs made two of their three
i tries good for 19. Stanford's prize
receiver, Don Colvin, managed to
get his hands on the bail just once
J when it was passed in his direction.
The rest of the time he was just
! barely visible in the herd of Broncos
| that surrounded him.
i The playing of Bill Sim was some
thing that must have warmed the
1 heart of every Farm follower, espe
cially those who have been moan
ing low over the condition of Bob
1 Maentz. Mr. Sim has been known
■ in the past as a "corner" whenever
the question of carrying the mail
arose. Now Mr. Sim is also known
: as a kicker, who can kick them with
j a twist that will bring tears into
the eyes of. those who catch and
, then drop the little pigskin practi
cally on the Indian goal line. Sim

Stanford defeated Santa Clara 14-0 Saturday, and they did most of

Ernie made twenty-one yards in the two plays that he carried the ball,
