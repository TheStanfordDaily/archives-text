# Fire Avoidance Week On Farm Starts Today
## Chief Dugan Requests Big Clean-Up Campaign 
### 
National Fire Prevention Week,
which begins today and last until
next Monday, will be observed at
Stanford. That is the information
which Stanford Fire Chief R. E. t
Dugan wishes assimilated by all
living groups on the campus, par
ticularly the fraternity and sorority j
houses.
Under Chief Dugan's leadership,
the Farm will execute its annual
clean-up campaign. Dugan con
siders that the importance "of this
week cannot be overestimated, as
the Stanford ti-adition that calls for i
an all-campus spring house-clean- |
ing has been replaced by Con vale- !
scent Day, on which only the Con- i
valescent Home is made fireproof.
Cardboard boxes and wooden !
crates in which books and clothing >
have been brought back to school j
furnish the worst hazards to a lire- i
less campus. Chief Dugan insists
that all fraternities and sororities
bring such refuse out of the cellars
and attics where they are stored j
and allow the garbage collector to
cart them away.
Last year Stanford's co-operation
during Fire Prevention Week was
good, and it should be better thisj
year. The campus' exceptionally low j
fire rate is due at least partially to
the effectiveness of this yearly cam
paign.
