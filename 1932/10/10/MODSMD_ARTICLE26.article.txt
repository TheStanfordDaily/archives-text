# WHAT, NO REHEARSAL?
## 
### 
Naively believing in the sincerity, though certainly not
in the wisdom, of ;i decision reached by the as yet un
ollicial rally coininittee at an unofficial meeting hist week,
the Daii.v Friday morning printed the words to the "Shin
ford Loyalty Song," a sort of hymn which the rally men
had deemed worthy of submission for approval to stu
dents iu the rooting section Saturday. Imagine the sur
prise, then, when the game passed without the band's
playing so much as a note of the song.
True, a horrible experience for all was avoided when
the scheduled rehearsal failed to materialize. For the song
is one that was rejected here several years ago when root
ing section music with a hymnal taint was even less un
popular than it is today.
Far back of it all, somewhere, there is a foundation of
common sense. Stanford does need a new song or two.
Almost without exception, tlx" present ones were written
in the heyday of the ballad, and therefore lack the modern
punch of the contemporary college rooting section song.
Hut this fact can hardly he construed into justification
for the hasty action of the rally committee in half-heart
edly approving for submission to the rooting section a
song which the committee itself had not even heard sung.
And why the committee should okeh the plan, let students
go to the game expecting the rehearsal, and then drop the
matter entirely is beyond conception.
The mistake once made, carrying it through would at
least have quashed the song once and for all, and, more
important, would have saved the committee the embar
rassment of explaining why, when it scheduled an event,
that event did not occur.
