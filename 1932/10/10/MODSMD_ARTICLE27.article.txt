# LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR!

The conscientious freshman, who believes thoroughly
in the spirit of the honor code at Stanford and who intends
to follow out the advice on this question which he has
been hearing since he arrived, is met almost immediately j
on attending chemistry laboratory by a most puzzling:
problem.
Through the very nature of the experiments conducted
il is far more feasible and efficient to do them in small
groups of men rather than singly. This custom is, and has
been, followed since the beginning of time. Hut the in
structors and professors have never made any statement (
concerning the matter, other than to call attention to the
Honor ('.ode as a general thing. Would il not be far wiser
if the special case of laboratory work were explained so
that the freshmen might not suffer the torments of con
science with which they are bound to be assailed?
This is clearly a case where the spirit of the ('ode is not
being sullied, although technically there might be cause
for argument. A true honor code, however, is not tangibly
technical but rather intangibly intellectual.
