# TOUCHING THEM DOWN

While Farm fans, sensing a possible Conference chain-!
pionship, are displaying greater enthusiasm over Pop
Warner's IJM2 i*ri(l creation than has been seen at Stan-1
ford in several years, living groups from the balls and
Mow will begin football competition among themselves|
(his week. This touch-football melee, rivalled only by j
basketball for its rough, rugged sport, has been the most
popular event on the intramural program for some time, i
Although not perfect in every way, the intramural sys
tem at Stanford goes a long way toward filling a need
which has been generally felt in university physical edu-i
cation circles throughout the country. Yale, with the fra
ternity idea almost completely stilled and her subsequently 1
looser-knit student groups, has answered this need in an
original way. Varsity football encounters have been lim
ited to live in number, with the surplus of coaching time
and ability being devoted to the development of strictly
inlra-Yale athletics.
Such a renaissance in physical education will never be
necessary at Stanford, so long as the fraternity and hall
groups retain their interest in intramural competition.]
Perhaps the greatest weakness of the Stanford system is
the fact thai it ordinarily embraces so small a fraction of
the freshman class.
Willi entries closing tonight for the touch-football j
leagues, and with five more teams needed to complete the
league brackets, nothing could more completely presage j
the success of the forthcoming intramural season than the
entrance of live freshman teams, representing separate
wings or floors of Kncina.
