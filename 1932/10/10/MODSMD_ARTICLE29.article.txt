# BULL SESSION
## THE
						WOOD-PILE IS FULL OF 'EM 
### 
Campus politics are usually so j
devious or meaningless that no one
I can tell what is going on or why. i
But the other evening something 1
happened that was so obvious it i
made one wonder. And so putrified
was the deal that even some of those !
! who gained by the transaction are j
beginning to grow mildly apprehen
sive.
i
i
It seems that it became necessary I
to choose a new rally committee. No
one knows exactly why. And the
deed was done —that is tentatively |
done. The Yell Leader and the
Chairman of the Rally Committee !
got together and concocted the list I
I —and did it pack a punch—a deadly
kick to all those who thought that !
petty machinations never showed
their annoying head on our non- i
| political campus.
The group includes 23 from the
j Row—l independent—and 6 from
, the Halls. Now, if Rally Committee
work required rare specialized abil
| ity like football, no one would ob
ject. Genius doesn't divide itself
mathematically by living groups, j
But everyone knows that anyone j
i who is reasonably possessed of all 1
! his limbs—and has not lost all of his |
cerebrum via psychological experi- j
ments, defective heredity, or intel- \
\ lectual paralysis—can very easily j
i handle the arduous tasks attendant \
i to the position.
j The Rally Committee is what may
be termed a "Quasi-Gravy Train."
' The work is not too excruciatingly
painful; and yet the returns are not
: too niggard to fully compensate for
the effort expended. Their work in j

| arousing enthusiasm, it would seem,
| would require students from all
j over the Campus—yet the present
I selection completely ignores Bran
i ner, Sequoia, Union—and gives En- j
! cina very meagre representation to
i say the least.
I 1
Nature in the raw is seldom mild, j
And the stunt that two Row men 1
i had the audacity to even try to foist j
!on the student-body is clearly in-'
| dicative of nature —very much in
! the raw; and it will probably not
: get a very mild reception.
One could really get annoyed at
i the affair if President Corbus and .
the Ex-Comm. did not have a crack
j at the whole thing. Those that know
i Bill Corbus tell me that he is not
j pleased at all. And can you blame j
I him? The Ex-Comm. will no doubt]
■ slash the list to bloody bits in their
J meeting tomorrow night.
Last year with a Hall man President j
! and a Hall man as Rally Chairman, i
'I he representation was about 50-50— j
! favoring the Row a little in fact! I
■ And now two men, who seem to
; have given brazen evidence they
j think that all that shines wears
\ Greek-letter pins, try a stunt like
| this. Their selection isn't even fair i
j to the Row —in that no less than 5 ;
| houses are given more than one j
! member—while as many as 16
houses go member-less.
!
The sadistic-minded campus is
eagerly awaiting to see the red (or '
should one say, blue) blood run ;
when Corbus and the Ex-Comm.
start swinging the heavy axe among
! the favored nominees.
