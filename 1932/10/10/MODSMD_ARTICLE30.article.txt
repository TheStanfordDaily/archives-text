## THE 						SUMMER FILM SEASON 
### 
In the main, the summer season ,
on the talking screen was far better
than might have been expected
from the output of the preceding
winter. But despite several major
! productions, widely publicized, there
was no outstanding film of the j
period, as "The Divorcee," "Holi
day," and "Free Soul" have marked
j previous summers. The season saw, ;
j however, valuable contributions to '
1 several types of film literature, if j
they may be called such.
Out-and-out comedy and sophis- ]
, ticated light comedy were the most j
i fruitful categories. A Marx Brothers j
film is always an event, and their j
I "Horsefeathers" justified the enthu- I
j siasm of a Marxmen fan. It was, if !
j anything, more farce than their pre- j
vious efforts, and was augmented by
j at least two good musical numbers,
cleverly handled.
Funnier even than "Horsefeath
ers" was "Blessed Event," the fast- i
est-moving film to flash across the j
screen in some time; the brisk dia- j
j logue was handled deftly by Lee
; Tracy, who emerged from obscure !
roles to give Alvin Roberts, the j
Winchellian reporter, an inimitable i
delineation.
"Down to Earth" would have been j
a zero without Will Rogers; with
1 him it was good entertainment. Jim- J

, mie Durante, the most naturally
j funny man in the movies, walked
l away with everything in which he
; appeared, notably "Speakeasily."
j "Make Me A Star" was an excellent
J adaptation of "Merton of the
i Movies."
M-G-M offered their opus mag
nus, "Strange Interlude," to meet
I with a variety of reactions. The
j Herculean task of putting O'Neill
'on celluloid (even with two sound
j tracks) turned out far better than
I might be expected, thanks princi
j pally to an adequate cast which la
! bored under pounds or grease paint,
j powder, and graying hair.
Charles Laughton emerged as the
j outstanding personality of the sum
: mer; he completely dominated "The
i Devil and the Deep," an insignifi
| cant story elevated by a magnificent
I characterization.
That splendid actor, Leslie How
; ard, contributed his second best to
j a second-rate film, "Reserved for
| Ladies," with a result far more
j pleasing than the best from most
i films.
"Doctor X" contained a liberal
i quota of thrills and a climax that
| takes its place beside the best
i blood-and-chill stories. "Miss Pink
j erton" was above average, and
j "50,000 Witnesses" is something defi
} nitely different. â€”E.C.
