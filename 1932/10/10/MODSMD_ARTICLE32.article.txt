; The Editor, Sir:
Are we ever" going to get any good 1
again out of our Stanford Axe? We |
1 have irked under the suspension
' now for over two years; I should
like at least to see some discussion ,
j aroused about it. From all the cele- i
brating we did when the Axe was j
brought back to us out of the Realm [
of the Bear, one might have ex-1
| pected "big times ahead!"
I am ready to suggest that we I
| crate the thing up and ship it back
|to Berkeley, where it once DID
cause just a little sensation occa
sionally. We could at least then
have the fun of trying to capture j
it again.
