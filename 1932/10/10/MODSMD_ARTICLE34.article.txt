The market hit well-greased skids
Friday and Saturday. Closing prices
i (down: compared to Sept. highs):;
; United Air 35%, Steel 25 r I, Motors
I 40%, Chrysler 40'J, N.Y. Central
! 35%, S.P. 45%, Standard of Cal 25%,
; Westinghouse 40%.
Weak grain and cotton markets j
! are counterbalanced by highest car
! loadings of year in week, ended Oct.
i Ist, better retaail trade, pick-up in
i steel operations, decrease in loans ;
I on life insurance. The only avail- j
1 t.ble explanation of the weak stock
; market tone is the fear of election i
! results. The market followers defi- i
j nitely do not favor a Democratic i
i administration.
It is unofficially reported that the
Exchange has asked brokerage
i houses to omit (in their market let- i
j ters) any references to possible re
| suits of the election on the market.
The few men of money and finan- .
j cial prestige in the Democratic
j ranks seem to be painfully silent
j when it comes to whooping it up
j for Franklin D. and gang. Mr. Owen
, D. (General Electric) Young has not |
registered for a drum-beating job.
I Mr. Bernard (Wall Street) Baruch
j has apparently tired of seeing his I
1 name in print. John J. (General!
| Motors, Dupont, Empire State Bldg.) '■
j Raskob, occupied perhaps in ar
i ranging to wrap his pet dirigible'
; mast in cellophane, hasn't leaped
; toward the band-wagon as yet. As
j for Mr. McAdoo (who took South- :
i ern California ads so literally he is
j now on deck for senatorial election)
I —news reel releases (Roosevelt's 1
! San Francisco speech) showed Hon.
| William Gibbs, known to L.A. fans j

as a howling prohi, applauding plea j
for bon voyaging the 18th Amend- ■
ment, and applauding mention of j
name of A1 Smith. Maychance Mac 1
calls the hot spot at Chicago a joke, i
This, then, the type of Roosevelt j
backers. Yet those in the know put I
the gravy on the line at 6-5, favor- |
ing Roosevelt. Barnum knew his
audience.
The voters having the mentality
they do have, the cash and carry
bulls and bears smell out loud that 1
Doc Hoover may get the royal !
Hawaiian boot and Medicine Man |
Roosevelt then be ushered in to give j
everybody what they want when'
they want it—on toast.
