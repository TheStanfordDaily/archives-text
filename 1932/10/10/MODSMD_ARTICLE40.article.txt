AND NOW THAT WE HAVE
DEALT OUT the usual hooey on
the game, as required by an
cient custom, we will hurst out
and say a lot of things that we
will probably regret.
First of all, don't count on Ernie
Caddel too much for the U.S.C.
game. Ernie is a fine ball player;
he i.s all that he is cracked up to be;
and we were darn sorry to see that
.shoulder dangling around like a
•sack of flower BUT, Stanford pinned
it;, hopes 0.1 Moffat, and he was
wrecked on his first play after the
opening kickoff when it came to
the crucial test.
Secondly, if Gordie Campbell's
knee doesn't get well, we've got to
scare up a new quarterback in a
hurry. No one has much idea what
Dusty Allen can do- he never gets
to play. But we hava an idea that
Afflerbaugh could call signals and
do a pretty good job of it. AND
spe:aking of afflerbaugh,
unless he is being saved for the
U.S.C. encounter, why in hades
doesn't he play more? He can kick
on a dime, he can run about as fast
as anyone out there, and when he
i.s in the game things happen. Still
he spends his time warming the
bench while the rest of the boys
are heaving wild passes all over the
field and getting very little done.
Thirdly, IF we can get our offense
to Ihe same point that our defense
is already approaching, and IF we
can get somebody to call the right
play at the right time, all the time
—WE WILL DEFEAT U.S.C.
THERE IS A GRAVE QUESTION
in the minds of most of the people
who saw Saturday's battle with the
Broncos as to how great they really
were. Well, they had a tough battle
with California, and they finally de
feated them. Then they went North,
took on a team that was grossly
underrated as far as Santa Clara
was concerned, and lost. THEN,
with their first chance to defeat
Stanford after having beaten Cali
fornia previously, they were the
victims of an 85-second score. Their
"Diamond Joe" Paglia, who, ac
cording to popular legend, would
keep Stanford in its own little "cof
fin corner," had his first kick blocked
and shortly turned into a touch
down. The Broncos' touted line was
outcharged, and outguessed.
But Santa Clara will come
hack and make it very uncom
fortable for many of its heredi
tary foes before the season is
over. And you can lay to that!
THIS FRESHMAN FOOTBALL
AGGREGATION of ours is quite an
onitil. It seems to have what the cash
customers cry for. During the first
half it will fuss around and accom
plish exactly nothing. Then, with
the advent of the last half, it sud
denly realizes that ii isn't so good
that it can get scores for the asking,
and ju.st takes a couple. So far this
system has worked beautifully. The
frosh have scored when they needed
points and have kept the opposition
from scoring when it wanted to. Let
us hope that they won't wait through
the first half when they get into
league competition, however; some
one might be so tough that they
couldn't score during the second
half either!
FROM THE SOUTHERN
PART OF THE STATE we un
derstand that the boys and girls
at U.S.C. are beginning to fear
that Stanford will prove to he
more than a workout. They find
that their team lacks the old
drive that characterized last
year's eleven every time it
reached the shadows of the goal
posts. Well, it's kind of early to
be saying things like that, hut
we wouldn't object to a victory,
if for no other reason than that
we are inquisitive to see what
it is like to heat the Sons of
Troy in something just once.
