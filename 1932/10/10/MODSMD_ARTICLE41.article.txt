# Mural Football Entries Close This Afternoon
## 
### 
Entry listings for the autumn sea
son of intramural touch football will
close this afternoon in preparation
for the team play which will start
on the four mural fields some time
this week. Delta Upsilon was the
latest sign-up over the week-end to
bring the total entries for league
play to 32.
Looking forward to four more en
tries during the day. Gene Mires,
mural manager, expects to end up
the listing with 36 teams. As a
source for his four needed squads,
Mires has a hopeful eye on some
prospective teams from the east or
west wings of the separate floors of
Encina hall. So far the freshmen
have not entered teams.
