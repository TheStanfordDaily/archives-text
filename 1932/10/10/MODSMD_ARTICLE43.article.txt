# Frosh Smear Strong San Mateo J.C. Team, 19-0
## YEARLING GRIDMEN SCORE 3 TIES IN LAST HALF DRIVE Frank Alustiza Plays Fast Game, Crosses Line For Two Tallies 
### Dick Strouse 
Stanford's freshman grid team
| came in like a lamb and went out
i like a lion Saturday afternoon, scor
' ing all its points in the second hali
I to defeat a heavy San Mateo eleven
19 to 0. Throughout the first two
I periods Wirfterburn's lambs, al
i though powerful enough on defense,
j were harmless and inoffensive
j whenever they had the ball.
Then came the fifteen-minute rest
period in which Winterburn changed
his mutton order to one of raw lion
steak and San Mateo decided that
she didn't want to win the ball game
anyway. Duplicating their second
half feat against Glendale J.C. the
j preceding week, the frosh kicked
| off, forced San Mateo to punt, and
; then marched along to a touchdown.
Twelve Points—Fifteen Minutes
j Frank Alustiza scored that first
I touchdown, and he deserved what
j ever honor six points in a freshman
■ game may bring, because his work
I v/as outstanding throughout the con
j test. Twice he went sliding off his
' right tackle for unaided fir. t downs,
j and whenever another back would
I fail or fumble or fall, they'd give
[ the ball to Frank and he would
I make up the distance with some to
i spare.
The second score came at the end
of the same quarter, Alustiza again
going over after the frosh marched
down the field with Alustiza and
| Hamilton alternating in the role of
I ball-carrier, pigskin-toter, runner,
or whatever you prefer to call the
i fellow who carries the ball and runs
I after the other fellows who fix up
| a place in which he can run.
One San Mateo Threat
Monk Moscrip tried and missed
! the extra point both times, but no
one cared as San Mateo didn't have
' a Chinaman's chance of scoring any
j way. Moscrip and A1 Trompas
! looked better during the game than
j the supposedly regular ends—Kings
! bury and Leedy.
! San Mateo did threaten once, when
j Carlyon pounded through the frosh
i line and continued until he was
j knocked out of bounds on the eight
| yard line by Moscrip. Then, al
j though San Mateo had the ball, the
' frosh gained three yards in four
I plays an dthat long run, which sup-
J plied the junior college's only first
; down, was never even approximated
| again.
A Pesky Fellow
San Mateo had one big tackle with
I the imposing number "50" in gigan
; tie numerals on his gigantic hack,
j who early in the game developed a
i decided liking for the society of the
! Card yearlings. For the rest of the
, contest, number 50 played his foot
| ball in the Stanford backfield, and
| he, along with the two strong San
| Mateo ends, stopped many Indian
i plays from behind.
The final score was made by
| Johnny Reisner, Bob Grayson's
! flashy substitute, when he went
j around his right end after a fumble
' apparently had halted a Card march.
Plenty of Exercise
Stanford's outstanding linemen
were Callaway and Woody Adams,
