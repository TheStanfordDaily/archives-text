# BEARS TIE ST. MARY'S, TROJANS WIN TO MATCH STANFORD VICTORY
## 
### MOLLY PHILLIPS 
While the Stanford Indian was
riding Santa Clara's Bronco around
Stanford Stadium Saturday, the
two most important Cardinal rivals
were also doing their share toward
keeping the city desks of California
newspapers well supplied with
headline material.
California, of Big Game and Bill
Ingram fame, held St. Mary's re
doubtable na tional-champions-that
were-to-bc to a 12 to 12 tie, while
Stanford's Southern cousins at
U.S.C. were defeating Oregon State
10 to 0.
California's moral victory which,
however, is only a tie in the record
columns, was earned by fight and,
incidentally, some fine football. The
Bears came from behind twice to tie
the score. Once Gus Castro inter
cepted a pass and ran 70 yards to a
touchdown and the final tally that
surprised and pleased Berkeley
with the latter pulling Corbus' iron
man act and playing all but eight
minutes of the game. In spite of his
large amount of exercise, Adams
was still the best blocker on the
field when he finally was excused
and allowed to take his tardy
shower.
Throughout the afternoon the
busiest ma non the field was the
referee, who carried on a monologue
all during the game with the San
Mateo leader that consisted of
"Ready Captain Head? Ready Cap
tain Head?''

i rooters was due to a blocked St.
! Mary's kick.
I The Trojans, without Ernie Pinck
â–  ert, Musick, Shaver, and Mallory,
I showed a woeful lack of scoring
I power and were forced to pass their
way to victory. Orv Mohler threw
i a 40-yard pass to Palmer and that
! good end ran 60 more feet to the
| goal-line. The extra S.C- points
came in the last quarter when Ernie
j Smith booted home a place-kick
from the 14-yard line after Oregon I
' State had stopped the Trojan run- j
i ning attack.
Both S.C. and O.C. showed power,
i but both were helpless when in
j scoring territory. Southern Califor
j nia is still undefeated, but the team,
{ at least to date, hasn't looked like
j the 1931 Trojan squad.
