# Nation's Gridiron Scores Show No Major Upsets

### ALBERT GUERARD 
| There was much gallant fighting,
i along the football fronts of North.
! South, East, and West Saturday af
! ternoon, but the nation's gridirons
! again furnished less surprises than
has been the rule in early October
j week-ends of former years,
j California's 12-12 tie with St.
I Mary's dealt a serious jolt to the
j ambitious expectations of Gael sup-
I porters, but was not unexpected in
! some quarters, since it was at about ;
this time last season that Bill In
| gram's Bears first be gan to show
j the form which later in the season
enabled them to win from Stanford, i
S.C. Takes to Air
While Stanford was badly out
classing Santa Ciara, Southern Cali- i
! fornia was again forccd into the air \
\ to attain a 10-0 victory over Oregon \
State. Although the brilliant Orville '
; Mohler was ripping past Oregon
I State's tackles for substantial gains,
U S.C.'s other baekfield men were
held completely in check.

! Indications that Jimmy Phelan is j
j not yet ready to surrender his j
I coaching job were given when j
! Washington held powerful Oregon j
J University to a scoreless tie. Two !
! minor Pacific Coast games provided ;
upsets: Nevada (!, Utah 6; and La j
Verne 15, San Diego Stale 12.
Colgate Looks Good
| Chicago's 7-7 tie with Yale liead
; lined the intersectional schedule,
while Columbia's 20-7 triumph over
; ; Princeton featured tho strictly
! Eastern games. Colgate showed Lre
! mendous power by swamping the
j same Niagara team (47-0), that last,
I week held Cornell to a single
i touchdown. Jock Sutherland's Pitts
! burgh eleven, in spite of a notori
j ously weak line, coasted over Du
quesne 33-0. Pittsburgh tackles
Stanford this year in a post-season!
game.
Michigan defeated Northwestern
15-6 in the most important game of ;
the day, the Wolverines scoring in |
the first minute of play. Purdue de
! feated Minnesota, Wisconsin tram
i pled lowa, and Ohio State and In- I
! diana tied in the other Big Ton
I games.
Texas Comes Back
Tulane University's Green Wave j
I was apparently on its way to an

other Southern Conference titles as
it outscored Georgia, 34-25, in one
of those classic battles which result
when both teams throw all caution
to the winds.
Texas University's astonishing 65-
0 walloping administered to Frankie
Carideo's Missouri eleven gives a
far truer indication of the Long
horns' worth than does their open
ing week defeat at the hands of
Centenary College. Rice Institute
had no trouble in downing Southern
Methodist, while Biff Jones' Louisi
ana State team upset Centenary 7-0.
