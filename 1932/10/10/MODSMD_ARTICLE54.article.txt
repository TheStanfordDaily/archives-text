# STANFORD HOOVER CLUB ORGANIZED
## 
### 
Because of a University ruling i
that organized political sentiment!
must come through the students, ]
rather than through off-campus par- |
tisans, a Stanford Hoover-for-presi- |
dent Club has been formed here, j
Last Saturday the group had its
first meeting. At this time the or- |
ganization of the club took place,;
with Les Hubles, chairman pro tem, j
appointing those present to posi
tions on the five committees —Fi-
nance, Membership, Publicity, Ral
lies, and Information.
Hablcs Defines Aims
Hables, who was unanimously ac
claimed permanent chairman by bis i
fellow committee men and women,
defined the aims of the association
in the following statement: "The
purpose of the Stanford Hoover j
Club is threefold: Primarily, of i
course, is our belief that Herbert j
Hoover is the man best qualified to i
direct the destiny of our nation I
through the present crisis. Because j
of this belief, we desire to support j
him actively during the present!
campaign.
Secondly, we fell that an in- !
terest in politics is fine experience !
for the student of today who be- J
comes the voter of tomorrow.
Thirdly, we intend to silence for j
good the insidious whispering, pre- |
valent on the Western coast, that;
Hoover's own home town and Uni
versity friends have turned from j
him and do not intend to vote in
his favor. We, here on the campus, i
know that this is not the case!"
Rally Planned
Already, definite plans and prep- [
arations are being made for a large I
impromptu rally to be held in front ;
of the Library some time early this
week. Mr. Baronson of the Repub- ;
lican National Committee will prob- j
ably address the students at this I
time for a few minutes. Final plans j
will be announced later.
