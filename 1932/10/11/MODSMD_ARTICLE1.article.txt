Moros and the Christian Filipinos. !
Attack Unexpected
Lieutenant Vicente Alagar, whose
body was brought back by members
of his party, was leading twenty
two men up a narrow trail on a !
peaceful expedition when three j
Moros appeared. The Lieutenant j
held out his hand in gesture of
friendship, it was declared, and one
of the Moros struck him down with
a spear. About fifty other Moros i
then appeared and the fight was on. !
Nine other constabulary men were
killed; the others fled.
A relief party was sent out and
lost two more killed in a successful i
assault upon the Moro camp. The I
Moros then were traced by scouts
to Tayungan.
