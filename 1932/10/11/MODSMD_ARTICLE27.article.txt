# CHEMIST TALKS ON MOLECULES

I
! The progress of science in dcter
| mining Ihe structure of molecules
| was told yesterday by Dr. Peter
! Debye of the University of Leipzig,
j world famous physicist.
Speaking in Room 20 of the Chem
istry Building, Dr. Debye presented
! details of his experiments with
j cathode and X-rays in analyzing
J the positions of the atoms compris
! ing the molecule. His photographic
' slides, he made clear, were pictures
! of the impressions made on the film
I by high voltage rays passing through
i molescular gasses.
The non-solid character of the
atomic structures, and the arrange-
I ment of atoms in definite patterns
| are some of the ideas predicted and j
J now accurately checked by Debye. |
