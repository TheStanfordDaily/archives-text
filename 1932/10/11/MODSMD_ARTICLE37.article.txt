I nusual in this day of specialization is the tremendous
versatility exhibited by Stanford's distinguished guest of
the week Julian S. Huxley. All those who can ought to I
make every effort to attend Professor Huxley's lectures!
given in the next few days, and while listening to the sub
ject matter reflect also on the character of the man speak
ing.
As interesting to the world as any experiment carried
<in in Professor Huxley's laboratory are the facts of tlie i
distinguished biologist's own heredity. Son of Leonard i
I lux ley, one of the most brilliant authors and editors of the i
past century, and related to such men as Matthew Arnold,'
Julian Huxley is a living proof of the power and import-,
mice of inheritance, a point which is often slighted by
members of a young community.
As a man, our guest cannot be classed in any strict
category, for besides eminence in biology, Professor
Huxley has attained distinction in literature, and on the
lighter side of his nature, we find a penchant for tennis,
bird sludv, and travel.
