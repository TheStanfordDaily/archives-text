# AN AESTHETIC FANATIC OR A VANDAL?
## 
### 
An announcement from the Comptroller's office stales
that chips ol statuary chiselled from the Mausoleum statu
ary are now worth twenty-five dollars provided that they
lead to the arrest and conviction of. the chiseller. The 1 ).\ily
is properly indignant at the spirit of vandalism which |
prompted the person or persons as yet and perhaps for
ever, unknown to so desecrate the last resting place of our
university's founders. It is n fairly safe bet that those frag- !
ments ol (he missing statuary are now reposing in the!
souvenir chest of some high school student or summer i
tourist from Kansas.
One cannot help wondering what motivated such an
act ol destruction. \ andalism il is, unquestionably, but
might il not have been the result of a fanatical conception
ol aesthetic values. Such conceptions have been respon
sible for the slashing and mutilation of world famous
canvasses in European and American art galleries.
1 he theory ol the fanatic aesthete lurking behind this
crime against Stanford property has a somewhat convinc
ing basis. The exact nature of the chiselling at the Mauso
leum was the severance of the tail from one of the marble
lions which crouch al either side of the entrance. These j
bestial figures, typical of Egyptian sculpture, are entirely
out of harmony with the (Jreek architecture of the struc-i
turc. The true aesthetic fanatic would not have stopped
al a tail, lie would have totally destroyed both figures, or
removed them.
