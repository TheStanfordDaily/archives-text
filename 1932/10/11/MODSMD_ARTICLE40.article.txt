# BULL SESSION
## LET'S GET TOGETHER 
### 
The day of the merger, pool, com
bine, and the get-together is at
hand. Competition Is in disrepute.
It makes a daily pilgrimage to the
shrine of general approval; and is
daily kicked in the lace without so
much as an ego-satisfying ceremony.
So . . . why shouldn't Stanford and
California get in the swim before
they both find themselves flat on
their respective backs drying out on
the mud-flats?

The reference is to the Bear-Gael
and Indian-Bronc football encoun
ters. Both were scheduled for the
same day and thus not only cut
< into each other's publicity in the
! metropolitan press, but what is
i more important, cut into each other's
gate receipts. Now this is an un
fortunate situation. We are not ad
vocating that Stanford and Califor
nia merge to form Calford 01* any
thing like that.
That would be bad business in
that the tremendous profits of the
"Big Game" would be lost to both
colleges. But obviously something
must be done to prevent the eco
nomic waste characterized by last
i Saturday's twin football schedule.
1 Football ?s Big Business plus—and
any Big Business tycoon knows that
throat cutting never got anybody
I anywhere. All that results from
1 throat-cutting is blood; and what
| Big Business wants is monetary ac
cumulation. And the same holds for
: College Football.

Now, theoretically for excitement
' purposes, Cal and Stanford take on
the guise of bitter enemies during
Big Game week. We shout '"Poor
i Cal"; they shout back, "Hate Stan

ford." Every rough on the Farm i
wants to eat Bear steaks; every
woman wants a brown fur neck
piece. And up at Berkeley, the I
crowds cry for red-skin. That's great |
stuff. No one wants to stop it. It's j
too much fun, and too harmless.

Yet, this enthusiasm should not i
blind anyone to the fact that both i
institutions (Stanford and Califor- :
nia) have financial gains at stake—
and what gains. To assure ourselves j
that these profits shall not go the j
way of all profits, regional agree- ;
merits should be undertaken with i
Cal. 'Schedules should be put into j
operation so that the two schools'
will not pull against each other— !
monetarily speaking.
Very probably, if Stanford and i
Cal were not playing on the same j
week-end, it would have been pos- ]
sible for both Institutions of High 1
Learning and Higher Football to |
reap larger profits. As soon as we j
realize that football has outgrown |
its namby-pamby sport days; and j
has been ushered into an age of j
Big Business—the whole thing clears j
up. While it may or may not be j
sport to those that play the game, I
it is definitely no longer sport to |
those who run it.

And those who operate the thing
should realize what Standard Oil,
American Tobacco, and others real
ized many years ago. Namely, that
agreements with competitors never
hurt, anybody. New water-wagons,
footballs, stadiums, helmets, etc.,
have been developed; and what is
now needed is a system of regional
schedules—which might as well start
in the bay region.

institutions (Stanford and Califor- :
nia) have financial gains at stake—
and what gains. To assure ourselves j
that these profits shall not go the j
way of all profits, regional agree- ;
merits should be undertaken with i
Cal. 'Schedules should be put into j
operation so that the two schools'
will not pull against each other— !
monetarily speaking.
Very probably, if Stanford and i
Cal were not playing on the same j
week-end, it would have been pos- ]
sible for both Institutions of High 1
Learning and Higher Football to |
reap larger profits. As soon as we j
realize that football has outgrown |
its namby-pamby sport days; and j
has been ushered into an age of j
Big Business—the whole thing clears j
up. While it may or may not be j
sport to those that play the game, I
it is definitely no longer sport to |
those who run it.

And those who operate the thing
should realize what Standard Oil,
American Tobacco, and others real
ized many years ago. Namely, that
agreements with competitors never
hurt, anybody. New water-wagons,
footballs, stadiums, helmets, etc.,
have been developed; and what is
now needed is a system of regional
schedules—which might as well start
in the bay region.

The day of the merger, pool, com
bine, and the get-together is at
hand. Competition Is in disrepute.
It makes a daily pilgrimage to the
shrine of general approval; and is
daily kicked in the lace without so
much as an ego-satisfying ceremony.
So . . . why shouldn't Stanford and
California get in the swim before
they both find themselves flat on
their respective backs drying out on
the mud-flats?

The reference is to the Bear-Gael
and Indian-Bronc football encoun
ters. Both were scheduled for the
same day and thus not only cut
< into each other's publicity in the
! metropolitan press, but what is
i more important, cut into each other's
gate receipts. Now this is an un
fortunate situation. We are not ad
vocating that Stanford and Califor
nia merge to form Calford 01* any
thing like that.
That would be bad business in
that the tremendous profits of the
"Big Game" would be lost to both
colleges. But obviously something
must be done to prevent the eco
nomic waste characterized by last
i Saturday's twin football schedule.
1 Football ?s Big Business plus—and
any Big Business tycoon knows that
throat cutting never got anybody
I anywhere. All that results from
1 throat-cutting is blood; and what
| Big Business wants is monetary ac
cumulation. And the same holds for
: College Football.

Now, theoretically for excitement
' purposes, Cal and Stanford take on
the guise of bitter enemies during
Big Game week. We shout '"Poor
i Cal"; they shout back, "Hate Stan

ford." Every rough on the Farm i
wants to eat Bear steaks; every
woman wants a brown fur neck
piece. And up at Berkeley, the I
crowds cry for red-skin. That's great |
stuff. No one wants to stop it. It's j
too much fun, and too harmless.

Yet, this enthusiasm should not i
