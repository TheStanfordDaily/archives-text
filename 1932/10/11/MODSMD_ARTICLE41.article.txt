TIGER SIIAKK (Warner)—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Numerous romantic shots of the
San Diego tuna fishing industry
support a flimsy plot in Robinson's
latest show. Effective filming of sea
fogs and tiger sharks bulldozes the
public into accepting three type
characters which move hectically
about the Mexican fishing waters
and the old triangle.
Robinson handles his role of the
Portuguese fisherman with becom
ing enthusiasm. His melodramatic
moments with Zita Johann and
with the tuna fish are convincingly
i shouted in the proper dialect. But
his death scene is twice as long as
it should be. And in his excitement
at almost viewing the pearly gates
he lapses, at the last moment, from
Portuguese into Yiddish.
Zita Johann was pretty enough
when she had nothing to do. But
she failed in attempting to imitate j
Garbo's aloof self-control in the
dramatic crescendos. Her forced
'■ coolness, instead of emphasizing the
j strain of the situation, seemed cold.
Richard Arlen easily accomplished
I his part as the heroic and go6d
looking young seafarer. The instant
i that he felt the fish-hook biting into
| the base of his neck was his best '
| moment. i
I

I THE BLONDE VENUS (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre.
Without benefit of legs, Marlene
Dietrich again conclusively proves
I that she is a screen personality to
!be reckoned wilh; "The Blonde
I Venus" is her picture from start to
finish, and no one really minds at
all.
The plot is insignificant, dealing
with a former actress who returns
i to the stage when her husband needs
I money, and in almost no time finds
■it expedient to be unfaithful to him.
| On his return, the husband for some
I reason resents her infidelity; and to
i avoid giving up their five-year-old
I boy, the mother goes through a
j series of events which ultimately
lead to the happy ending.
No matter what she goes through,
one is never able to lose the real
i Marlene Dietrich. The role of Helen
Faraday is not as showy as her pre
| vious ones, and gives the actress
| more opportunity to act. Several
paragraphs could easily be devoted
to the Dietrich songs, the first since
her early films. Her voice seems
materially improved, and excellent
photography and sound make the
vocal portions the outstanding
scenes of the picture. One number,
"You Little So-and-So," was espe
i cially charming.

No matter what she goes through,
one is never able to lose the real
i Marlene Dietrich. The role of Helen
Faraday is not as showy as her pre
| vious ones, and gives the actress
| more opportunity to act. Several
paragraphs could easily be devoted
to the Dietrich songs, the first since
her early films. Her voice seems
materially improved, and excellent
photography and sound make the
vocal portions the outstanding
scenes of the picture. One number,
"You Little So-and-So," was espe
i cially charming.
TIGER SIIAKK (Warner)—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Numerous romantic shots of the
San Diego tuna fishing industry
support a flimsy plot in Robinson's
latest show. Effective filming of sea
fogs and tiger sharks bulldozes the
public into accepting three type
characters which move hectically
about the Mexican fishing waters
and the old triangle.
Robinson handles his role of the
Portuguese fisherman with becom
ing enthusiasm. His melodramatic
moments with Zita Johann and
with the tuna fish are convincingly
i shouted in the proper dialect. But
his death scene is twice as long as
it should be. And in his excitement
at almost viewing the pearly gates
he lapses, at the last moment, from
Portuguese into Yiddish.
Zita Johann was pretty enough
when she had nothing to do. But
she failed in attempting to imitate j
Garbo's aloof self-control in the
dramatic crescendos. Her forced
'■ coolness, instead of emphasizing the
j strain of the situation, seemed cold.
Richard Arlen easily accomplished
I his part as the heroic and go6d
looking young seafarer. The instant
i that he felt the fish-hook biting into
| the base of his neck was his best '
| moment. i
I

I THE BLONDE VENUS (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre.
Without benefit of legs, Marlene
Dietrich again conclusively proves
I that she is a screen personality to
!be reckoned wilh; "The Blonde
I Venus" is her picture from start to
finish, and no one really minds at
all.
The plot is insignificant, dealing
with a former actress who returns
i to the stage when her husband needs
I money, and in almost no time finds
■it expedient to be unfaithful to him.
| On his return, the husband for some
I reason resents her infidelity; and to
i avoid giving up their five-year-old
I boy, the mother goes through a
j series of events which ultimately
lead to the happy ending.
