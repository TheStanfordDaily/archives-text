[I Yesterday's stock market closed
11 weak, final quotations showing sub-
I stantial losses. The moderate sales
I ■to which the market has been sub
j! jected in the last four trading days,
I coupled with the severe losses suf
j fered in the same interval, tend to
i indicate that a determined selling
!! campaign is being carried out by
| security holders who, from the face
I of things, fear only the result of the
j presidential electiur-..
Due to the recent rapid decline it
is natural to assume that the market
! is entitled to a technical x - ecovery.

hope to such an upturn. All trade
I indications, while not exceptionally
bullish, are not in any sense bearish.

porate structure of this country is
! to be continued in its present form,
: the market offers exceptional buys,
providing such commitments are
made with good judgment in com
j panies of recognized standing and

I grade bonds, permit advantageous
investment at present levels. Many
| railroad bonds of the larger roads,

j ment. Any purchases at current
' levels, however, should be made

j good chance that lower prices may
I be touched before the market points
definitely higher.
The one big opportunity for con-
I siderable profit to those who pur

I doubtedly set in motion the greatest
