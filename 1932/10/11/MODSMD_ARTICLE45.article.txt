The Editor, Sir:
' Frequent of, late, have been the
beseeching entreaties of the loud
j mouthed sophomores, who shout,
j "To hell with '36." Is the Class of
i '35 so lonesome where it is that it
; wants the company of the noble
Class of '36?

The Editor, Sir:
I am no admirer of Bill Plymat,
but I believe that the Daily erred
in printing an article about him last
Friday. Why? Because while poking
fun at Mr. Plymat, the Daily gave
many the impression (false, I hope)
! that it was not only laughing at
i Bill's actions, but also at his idea
that it was a good thing to keep
j sober.
Now, get me straight. I would not
argue for or against prohibition.
What I am interested in is how in
the world can we expect the labor
ing man to say no to intoxicants
when his collegiate brother does not.
It is true, no doubt, that most of his
i collegiate brothers can have inti
mate contact with "Demon Rum"
and do little harm to themselves or
others, but that is not the case with
j most of the "men in the streets."

"Joe College," therefore, lias got the
job of staying sober, not to keep
from "going to the dogs," but to set
an example for others not so for
tunate. And that is why I would
urge that the D.tiiy refrain from
poking fun at Bill Plymat until it
has exhausted all other sources of
interesting or humorous subjects.
