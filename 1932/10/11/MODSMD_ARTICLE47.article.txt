# West Coast Army to Battle Cards Here Saturday
## "JARHEADS" HAVE STRONG SQUAD; TO GIVE CARDS FIGHT Gannuzzi Lost To Lineup After Eight Seasons As Army Halfback 
### 
When West Coast Army s Jar
heads invade Stanford Stadium Sat
urday for their annual shellacing at
the hands of "Pop' Warner's In
dians, "Nodgie" Gannuzzi, gallant
Army fullback, for the first time in
many, many seasons will not be in
the starting lineup.
Eight seasons oi play on a worse
than-average team have begun to
take their toll. Back in 1924 Can
uzzi first began his "iron-man
stunt for the Presidio eleven, and
now that the Army has at last been
favored with fairly good material,
ihe great "Nodgie" has begun to
slip.
Gannuzzi Slips
15)28 and 192!) were big years for
the little Army captain, safety man,
passer, kicker, chief inter!crer and
defensive player. 1930 and 1931
Nodgie slowed up just a wee bit,
but this fall he declared himseli
ready for his biggest season.
Gannuzzi didn't quite click against
the Olympic Club, although his
team broke through for its first vic
tory against the Post Street grid
ders in years.
Last Sunday, when the Army
staged one of the most surprising
upsets in Pacific Coast history, de
feating San Francisco University,
Denman was the starting Anny full
back, and "Nodgie" watched the
kickoff from the bench, and after
the final gun had sounded, Gan
nuzzi announced that ho would do
no more playing until the annual
Armistice Day clash against the
West Coast Navy.
Army Surprises
Noted for its bull-like line plung
ing, straight football tactics, the
Army surprised at Kezar Stadium
Sunday by pulling a trick lateral
forward pass out of the bag. It is
this play that Stanford will have to
watch most next Saturday after
noon.
Although the Indians should have
no trouble in winning, even without
Ihe services of Ernie Caddel, Gor
don Campbell, Here Laborde, Red
Gi ibben, and Carlos Monsalve, they
will find the Jarheads much tougher
than in former years. The Army's
two outstanding players are both
officers â€” Lieutenants Price and
Green, and under West Coast Army
football regulations they cannot be
in the game at the same time, so
the Presidio outfit will be slightly
weaker than it might be if it were
playing under collegiate rules.
