# Frosh Ready For U.C.L.A.
## 
### 
The native sons of the Stanford
Red who comprise the freshman
football team leave Saturday for a
week-end jaunt to Los Angeles
where they play the U.C.L A. year
lings. The frosh, undefeated and
.â€¢cored on just once, will be out to
protect their record.
In preparation for Saturday's tus
sle, Coach "Chuck" Winterburn put
those men who did not play against
San Mateo through a hard scrim
mage last night. After it was over
he and his assistant, John Bunn,
were pleased especially with the
work of Halfback Mallatratt, Full
back Sears, and Guard Evarts.
Mallatratt Versatile
Mallatratt is best known as a bas
ketball and; baseball star. Evarts
showed up late for frosh practice
this year, an dis now challenging
Adams, Rouble, and Pinotti, while
Sears' work has been dwarfed by
that of Frank Alustiza and Ock
Morgan.
The 19 to 0 frosh victory over San
Mateo Junior College was particu
larly cheering insofar as California's
Cubs defeated the same team only
7 to 6. Reading from left to right
in the line, Leedy, Reynolds, Adams,
Roth, Rouble, Callaway, and Kings
bury started the game and when
they left it their substitutes proved
just about as good.
