With a so-called "breather"
coining up for Saturday, Farm
fans will get a chance to see
j some of the boys on the squad
who have failed to show much
so far merely because (hey lack
the experience necessary to get
them into an important game.
Warner naturally has his eye on
j the battle with El Trojan two weeks
j hence, and he will take no chance
i of having his championship-bound
1 apple-cart upset through unneces
sary injuries.
| The center position will fail to j
[ reveal any startling new faces be- 1
| cause there are three boys so good
i that the Old Man has been unable i
j to pick any one of them as firstj
| string center for more than a week |
j at a time.
Albertson is rounding into the
shape (hat made him a potential
first-s(ring pivot man two years |
ago with gratifying rapidity.
BEanchard is living up to all (lie
I nice (hings that were said about
him before (he season got under
way. And Bill Bates has shown
so much more than even the
rabid followers of (he Stanford
Cardinal hoped for (hat he drew
(he starting assignment against
Santa Clara's always dangerous
Broncos.
Out on the wings, Mr. Public will
! see a lot more of Monslave and
; Packard. We still think that this
; boy Packard will set a lot of scrib
blers to scribbling frantically in his
| favor before the season gets very
much older. He is big, fast and
j clever and he should be a wow
i wit h more experience, which is what
i he can get in games like the coming
j contest.
In the backfield there will be the
j fast-coming Chuck White, the al
i ready-polished AfHerbaugh, and

probably the slippery Buck Van-
Dellen. This trio makes up the rest
of the group of sweet halves that
Pop has been gloating over since
the start of the year.

j If you don't think that Harry
Maloney has his troubles turning
'out a championship soccer aggrega
! tion just try this one on your pi
! aner.
With a week of practice behind
! them, the varsity squad takes on San
I Jose Wednesday in the conference
j opener before they have had a
' chance to really find the best first
J team. And as if this were not
! enough, they journey away from
j the campus again Saturday to tackle
1 a strong San Mateo eleven.
Coach Maloney is banking on
! a number of sophomores, and a
transfer who has had only one
i year of varsity competition, to
i bring home the bacon. If these
men can stand up under a gruel
ling schedule of two games a
week for the first week or two,
there is little reason to fear that
the conference bunting will stray
i trom the campus for another
year.
Just to vary the monotony of
watching the boys kick a ball around
in one game or another, we trotted
ourselves out to Harry Walter's
sunken diamond where they teach
you to hang onto the darn thing.
Harry had so many athletes romp
ing around his yard that it looked
as if this were the winter quarter,
not just fall practice. Upwards of
40 men have reported already, and
it looks as if making the ball club
this year will be as bad as crash
ing the majoi's.
When the West Coast Army
starts out after another collegiate
scalp this Saturday, keep your
j eyes peeled for the appearance
of one Stan Anderson, kicker par
excellence, and rapidly becoming
i ball player de luxe.
I Anderson is reknowned as the best
1 punter on the squad but few people
I realize that he is one of the "comers"
| whom Warner has been unable to
| use because of the wealth of ex
' perienced material that is battling
< for varsity positions.
Stan has Baker and Hillman ahead
i of him at the present time, and he
i will have to show plenty to beat
j either of them, but one of these days
i he may do just that.
