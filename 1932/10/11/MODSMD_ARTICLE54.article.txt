# HONEY TO SEND CARD SOCCER MEN AGAINST SAN JOSE
## Green Indian Team Meets State College Outfit Here Wednesday 
### 
What was a malicious Stanford ,
Indian that went through last year's ;
campaign without a defeat and had
only two ties with S.F.U. to mar
an otherwise perfect record, will j
make its first 1932 showing tomor- j
row afternoon when Coach Harry j
Maloney takes his varsity soccer j
.squad to San Jose to battle the San i
Jose State outfit.
The season's opener should give J
Maloney a chance to experiment
with his somewhat inexperienced (
team, in as much as the San Jose
hooters were the weakest aggrega
tion in the league last year and
show no promise of improving their
status during the current competi
tion.
New Men To Play
The team will take the field with I
only four members of the cham
pionship 1931 outfit in the lineup.
It is on new material that the suc
cess of the squad will depend.
Art Hearn, veteran forward who
has been dividing his time between j
soccer and baseball, was missing in j
yesterday's scrimmage, but should [
return to the fold in time to take j
care of the inside right position to- '
morrow. Gaston Rojas filled in yes
terday and played well enough to J
establish himself as a worthy re- !
serve to back up Hearn.
Johnson Kicks Well
Cy Johnson, who caused the var- i
sity plenty of trouble last year as j
an ineligible member of the squad, j
will direct the team at center for- |
ward. Johnson, who can kick equal- j
ly well with either foot, demon
strated his scoring possibilities by ;
ringing up the only goal in yester- j
day's scrimmage between the first ;
and second teams.
Sophs Play j
Two members of last year's frosh i
find themselves teaming up as half- \
backs with Alex Spohr, a letlerman. |
Doug Kennedy, freshman captain, i
opens at center half, with Waddy j
White covering the left side of the ;
backfield.
Another sophomore in the starting
lineup is Harry Branch at right
fullback. Branch is a tall, lanky
fellow who gets lots of power be
hind his kicks. Erwin Breckelmaum
has not yet reached his 1931 form, j
but is still head and shoulders above j
the rest of the candidates for the j
other fullback post. i
Jack King Goalie
The toughest spot on the team |
falls to Goalie Jack King who will i
try to carry on where All-Confer- I
ence Goalie Webster of last year's
squad left off. With a capable pair
of fullbacks to protect him, King
has been taking care of the situa
tion admirably in practice scrim
mages.

but is still head and shoulders above j
the rest of the candidates for the j
other fullback post. i
Jack King Goalie
The toughest spot on the team |
falls to Goalie Jack King who will i
try to carry on where All-Confer- I
ence Goalie Webster of last year's
squad left off. With a capable pair
of fullbacks to protect him, King
has been taking care of the situa
tion admirably in practice scrim
mages.
What was a malicious Stanford ,
Indian that went through last year's ;
campaign without a defeat and had
only two ties with S.F.U. to mar
an otherwise perfect record, will j
make its first 1932 showing tomor- j
row afternoon when Coach Harry j
Maloney takes his varsity soccer j
.squad to San Jose to battle the San i
Jose State outfit.
The season's opener should give J
Maloney a chance to experiment
with his somewhat inexperienced (
team, in as much as the San Jose
hooters were the weakest aggrega
tion in the league last year and
show no promise of improving their
status during the current competi
tion.
New Men To Play
The team will take the field with I
only four members of the cham
pionship 1931 outfit in the lineup.
It is on new material that the suc
cess of the squad will depend.
Art Hearn, veteran forward who
has been dividing his time between j
soccer and baseball, was missing in j
yesterday's scrimmage, but should [
return to the fold in time to take j
care of the inside right position to- '
morrow. Gaston Rojas filled in yes
terday and played well enough to J
establish himself as a worthy re- !
serve to back up Hearn.
Johnson Kicks Well
Cy Johnson, who caused the var- i
sity plenty of trouble last year as j
an ineligible member of the squad, j
will direct the team at center for- |
ward. Johnson, who can kick equal- j
ly well with either foot, demon
strated his scoring possibilities by ;
ringing up the only goal in yester- j
day's scrimmage between the first ;
and second teams.
Sophs Play j
Two members of last year's frosh i
find themselves teaming up as half- \
backs with Alex Spohr, a letlerman. |
Doug Kennedy, freshman captain, i
opens at center half, with Waddy j
White covering the left side of the ;
backfield.
Another sophomore in the starting
lineup is Harry Branch at right
fullback. Branch is a tall, lanky
fellow who gets lots of power be
hind his kicks. Erwin Breckelmaum
has not yet reached his 1931 form, j
but is still head and shoulders above j
the rest of the candidates for the j
other fullback post. i
