# TWO INTRAMURAL TOUCH GRIDIRON TEAMS NEEDED TO COMPLETE COMPETITIVE LIST
## 
### BOB JONES 
Wanted: Two more intramural
touch football teams.
Lacking two mural grid squads to
complete the entry list of 36 teams
for the autumn competition which
begins next Monday afternoon, Gene
Mires, mural manager, sent out a
call yesterday afternoon for addi
tional grid squads when the sign-up
showed the deficit.
Theta Delta Chi and Delta Kappa
Epsilon were yesterday's entries to
the touch tackle sport to bring the
total to 34 teams.
Mires will call a meeting of all
organization managers listed with
the teams for touch football Thurs
day night at 7:30 o'clock in Room 45
of the B.A.C. Building. He will ex
plain the complete rules of the game
and the playing schedule so that
there will be no complaints on the
score of a lack of understanding
from any outfit.
A hardy string of men will be in
order for play in the touch tackle
games according to the rules of the
mural grid sport. In a half period
of 20 minutes' playing time, a team
of seven members, organizations
may send into a game a player only
once in each half period. Although
contrary to the new rules of foot
ball, this rule holds good in mural

I play because the games are not di- j
vided into quarters. No limitation, i
on the other hand, is placed upon
the reserve strength of a team. Any
player is eligible to receive a pass.
Using regulation 100-yard fields, !
teams will play on the four gridirons I
ruled off on the varsity and frosh i
' baseball diamonds. On such fields a j
regular kick-off is in order. Substi
tutes are required to report to the ■
i referee except at beginning of the ■
second half. Failure on the part of a j
! player to do so entails a 5-yard
penalty.
According to Mires, student re- i
! fereos are needed to officiate in the \
mural games. Prospective referees J
: are requested to see the manager ;
in the proctor's room or at 213 Toy- !
, on Hall. Fees per game are 50 cents. |
To boost the total of mural golf
entries to 19 in number, Delta Up
silon, Theta Delta Chi, Theta Xi,
and Phi Kappa Psi were the latest
i names on the entry listings. Play on
i the University course moves under ;
way next Monday with entries clos
ing tomorrow.
! The handball tournament which
starts next Monday along with the!
I golf attracted Delta Upsilon, Theta j
Delta Chi, and Kappa Sigma to its |
i roster of 13 teams.
