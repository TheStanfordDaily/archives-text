There isn't a team in the country
that can match this record of "Hunk"
Anderson's 1932 edition of the Notre
Dame varsity—l 64 points in two
games!
Stanford, Southern California,
Michigan, Tulane, Virginia Poly, and
Rice notwithstanding, the Notre
Dame Ramblers have all the ear
marks of another championship
team.
Hunk Anderson has twenty-three
1931 lettermen back for his 1932
eleven—his only graduating regu
lars were Marchy Schwartz, All -
American halfback; Tommy Yarr,
center; Frank Hoffmann, guard; and
Dick Mahoney, end. Of this quartet,
only the great Schwartz cannot be
easily replaced.
Two halfbacks who lack finish,
but may yet rise to Ail-American
greatness (it's a habit among Notre
Dame left halfbacks) are back to
replace Schwartz. They are Mike
Koken and Nick Lukats.
To make up for the absence of
Mahoney, Anderson had only to
shift Captain Paul Host from left
to right end, leaving Ed Kosky as
Host's running mate at right end.
Kitty Gorman is one of the best
center prospects to ever enroll at
Notre Dame, but hitherto "he has
understudied that great scrapper,
Tommy Yarr, captain of the 1931
Rambler eleven. There are six beefy
guards ready to step into Frank
Hoffman's vacated guard berth.
Notre Dame's tackle pah - (with all
due respect to California's Tozer
and Ransome, U.S.C.'s Smith and
Brown, and Stanford's Laborde and
Grey) is the best in the country.
Krause and Kurth are heavy-set,
hard-charging players. One of them
should make All-American.
Notre Dame's other backfield
men: George Melinkovich, Steve
Banas, and Charles Jaskwhich, the
regulars, not to mention substitutes
Sheeketski, Brancheau, Millheam,
and Vejar, are as good as their
names would imply. Jaskwhich is
the brains of the team, Banas has
the speed, and Melinkovich the
drive that counts inside the ten
yard line.
In addition "Hunk" Anderson has
two more Carideos on his squad:

.Quarterback Angelo and Fullback
Fred, both brothers of the great
Frank. They are still but "promi -
j ing propects."
The 1931 freshmen at South Bend
! were the best in the history of the;
'school. Much is expected of a bril
liant Chicago sophomore, McDufT.
Several dispatches from the Middle
west indicate that McDuff is already
fcood enough to step into the place
j vacated by Marchy Schwartz.
All in all, it looks as though the
depression was about washed up,
jas far as Notre Dame's gridiron
business is concerned, but will
know more about that the afternoon
jof September 10, about (» o'clock,
| when the Ramblers' battle against
; U.S.C.'s Trojans has come to an end.

There isn't a team in the country
that can match this record of "Hunk"
Anderson's 1932 edition of the Notre
Dame varsity—l 64 points in two
games!
Stanford, Southern California,
Michigan, Tulane, Virginia Poly, and
Rice notwithstanding, the Notre
Dame Ramblers have all the ear
marks of another championship
team.
Hunk Anderson has twenty-three
1931 lettermen back for his 1932
eleven—his only graduating regu
lars were Marchy Schwartz, All -
American halfback; Tommy Yarr,
center; Frank Hoffmann, guard; and
Dick Mahoney, end. Of this quartet,
only the great Schwartz cannot be
easily replaced.
Two halfbacks who lack finish,
but may yet rise to Ail-American
greatness (it's a habit among Notre
Dame left halfbacks) are back to
replace Schwartz. They are Mike
Koken and Nick Lukats.
To make up for the absence of
Mahoney, Anderson had only to
shift Captain Paul Host from left
to right end, leaving Ed Kosky as
Host's running mate at right end.
Kitty Gorman is one of the best
center prospects to ever enroll at
Notre Dame, but hitherto "he has
understudied that great scrapper,
Tommy Yarr, captain of the 1931
Rambler eleven. There are six beefy
guards ready to step into Frank
Hoffman's vacated guard berth.
Notre Dame's tackle pah - (with all
due respect to California's Tozer
and Ransome, U.S.C.'s Smith and
Brown, and Stanford's Laborde and
Grey) is the best in the country.
Krause and Kurth are heavy-set,
hard-charging players. One of them
should make All-American.
Notre Dame's other backfield
men: George Melinkovich, Steve
Banas, and Charles Jaskwhich, the
regulars, not to mention substitutes
Sheeketski, Brancheau, Millheam,
and Vejar, are as good as their
names would imply. Jaskwhich is
the brains of the team, Banas has
the speed, and Melinkovich the
drive that counts inside the ten
yard line.
In addition "Hunk" Anderson has
two more Carideos on his squad:

.Quarterback Angelo and Fullback
Fred, both brothers of the great
Frank. They are still but "promi -
j ing propects."
The 1931 freshmen at South Bend
! were the best in the history of the;
'school. Much is expected of a bril
liant Chicago sophomore, McDufT.
Several dispatches from the Middle
west indicate that McDuff is already
fcood enough to step into the place
j vacated by Marchy Schwartz.
All in all, it looks as though the
depression was about washed up,
jas far as Notre Dame's gridiron
business is concerned, but will
know more about that the afternoon
jof September 10, about (» o'clock,
| when the Ramblers' battle against
