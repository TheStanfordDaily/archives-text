# '36 Men Enter Swim Tryouts
## 
### 
Wednesday afternoon at 4:20
o'clock the first freshman swimming
' i trials will be held in Encina pools,
i ! This will be the first opportunity
I for Coach Nort Thornton to get a
; ! definite idea of the ability of his
! papooses fur the coming season.
Only three events will be run ofE
and they will be short high-school
; j distances. The boys have been used
, i to swimming the shorter races and
Coach Thornton feels they should
■ ! not be pushed up to the lengthier
; | events too soon.
The 100-yard breaststroke .should
I I be a great duel between William
' j Nash and Ken Livingston. Both boys
I | have covered the distance in excep-
I ; tional time and are considered two
• j of the best breaststroke prospects
, I to enroll at Stanford for some time,
i | In the 100-yard backstroke, De
: faix Myers and Ed Maples appear to
1 ibe the two outstanding men. How
! ever, they will be hard pressed by
Pollack and Croverling.
Although there are no outstand
j ing free-style men on the squad,
I this event, which will be over the
50-yard course, should be a battle
between Charles Danforth, Norman
Euell, Pollack, and Myers.
In spite of all protective devices
forgery still flourishes to the amount
1 of about $200,000,000 yearly.
