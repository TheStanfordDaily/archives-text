Clothes may not make the man, but they cer
tainly w|n the crowd.
Perhaps that's why university men from Maine to California have
so enthusiastically adopted the handsome light-colored corduroy
trousers called Campus Cords.
The distinctive hip-fit and straight-hang of Campus Cords are
copied, but never quite equaled. Campus Cords are correct in shade,
and authentic in every detail of university style.
These good looking trousers wear almost forever, plus two days.
Cleaning or washing merely restores their youth.
One look at yourself in Campus Cords, and you know your Public
will approve. See them now, at a leading store near you. Remem
