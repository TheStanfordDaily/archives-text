# VARSITY SQUAD RESTS AS SUBS GET WORKOUTS
## Warner Prepares For Army: Before Pointing To Trojan Contest SAVING FIRST STRING Will Be First Chance To See Reserve Power 
### 
Giving his varsity squad a few
days of rest before serious prepara
tion for the Trojan game begins,
Pop Warner concentrated his atten
tions on the coming Army game
last night as he sent his second
and third stringers through a half
hour's scrimmage.
While the Old Fox has not offi
cially announced his starting lineup
against the Jarheads indications from
.he practice field are that there will
not be a first stringer on the open
ing eleven. And unless the Jarheads
put up too stubborn a battle against
the Card reserves, the varsity eieven
will remain on the bench for the
entire afternoon.
Army Not Weak
There is a strong possibility, how
ever, that such a battle may be
waged by these soldiers next Satur
day. They have made a respectable
impression on Pacific Coast football
this year, principally by defeating
the U.S.F. Dons last Sunday.
Secondly, the fact that the Indians
will be worrying about the Trojan
contest on the following week may ;
cause them to consider the Army |
outfit too lightly. At any rate, Sat- j
urday's affair will be the first op- j
portunity this season for Stanford's
reserve material to give an account j
of itself.
Varsity Ready
Meanwhile, the Card varsity stock !
took a jump last night when Bill j
Bates and Ernie Caddel appeared in i
suits, giving an indication that by j
the middle of next week die entire j
squad with the exception of Bob .
Macntz will be ready to face the i
Trojans. Maentz, together with Here |
Laborde and Gordie Campbell, are !
the remaining members of the hos- [
pital list. Whether Campbell will be j
icady for the Trojans or not is un- i
predictable, as Gordie is still hob- ,
bling around with a bad-looking j
knee.
Among the many possible starters j
for Saturday's tilt a few can be |
mentioned who will at least see ac- J
lion. In the backfield. Wes Stevens. |
Chuck White, Dusty Allen, and !
Buck Van Dellen are likely starters, j
The line will be picked from a
wealth of reserve material on which !
Rogers, Minkler, Packard, Mon
salve, Blanchard, and O'Connor have
shown the most promise.
As the week draws to a close,;
Warner will probably continue to j
devote much of his attention to the 1
reserves, letting the varsity take it
easy before heavy practice for the
Trojan contest is held the early part
of next week.
