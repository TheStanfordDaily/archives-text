# Paly Children Play With Rattlesnake
## 
### 
Barbara Jane, aged 3, and Billy
Jr., aged 5, were playing "Wild
West" in their father's garage at
253 Mariposa street. They found a
gophei snake and put it in a coffee
can.
Triumphantly they carted their
reptile captive to father William
Cook, member of the Palo Alto po
lice force. The officer was horrified
when he discovered that the chil
dren had snared a rattlesnake.
The snake met an ignominious
end under the wheels of a San
Francicco-bound Lark. This is the
first rattlesnake seen in Palo Alto
for several years.
