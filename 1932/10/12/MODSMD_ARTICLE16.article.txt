# DEBYE DELIVERS SECOND SPEECH
## Physicist Speaks Today On Electrolytes 
### 
i Speaking on the "Structure of J
: Liquids," Dr. Peter Debye, German j
i physicist, yesterday completed the j
i second in a series of four campus |
| science lectures. Today at 4:15 i
j o'clock, Debye will speak in Room ;
20 of the Chemistry Building on j
| "Some New Phenomena in Electro- |
i lytes."
| According to the latest discoveries
| made by Dr. Debye, liquids are no
1 longer held to be constructed of a
j disorderly arrangement of atoms.
There is a symmetry in liquid struc-
I ture which approaches near to the
! atomic architecture of crystals.
This new idea comes in distinct
i rebuttal to the old conception set
forth in "Continuity of Liquids and
I Gases Stated." It was written that
there was no essential difference be
| tween the structures of gas and
| liquids.
The Debye experiments have been i
| made possible through the use of j
j X-rays with wave lengths approxi- |
! mating to the distance between the j
I molecules.
