# Two Dozen Clocks Enable Barber to Time Short Shave

i ——
William George Seppich, a Palo \
Alto barber, who lives on Easy
I Street, Mountain View, has a good
! time.
In fact, he has two dozen good
times. He is a collector of clocks,
'and in his shop 24 of them tick off
minutes and hours while William
[ clips off whiskers and hairs.
j One is a pocket alarm clock. An
other is inherited from his German
ancestor, Peter Seppich, who lived
i in the 16th century. Others include
1 early colonial clocks, ancient ship's
clocks, old English clocks, and just
. clocks.
But William is more than a mere ,
I clock collector. He is a man of the
world also. He says himself, "I
couldn't have been an ordinary
greenhorn when I first came to
America, because right away the j
| newspapers began to interview me.
I I go around with intellectual people,

i too. Dr. Gardner of the Stanford
Chapel is one of my best friends."
He has adopted the anniversary
of his coming to the United States
as his birthday, and the number of
years spent in this country (48) as '
his age. His life in the fatherland
I was cut off without a moment's j
j recognition.
William is nothing if not a fair- !
; minded man. A couple of years ago
| he demonstrated he is not the kind i
to drive another to a hard bargain. \
He was taking unto himself a wife '
in Redwood City. With the marriage !
license in his hand, he turned to his >
bride-elect, and said, "If you don't j
, want to go through with this, now ,
is your chance to get out of it. If j
you don't want to, we'll tear up this j
thing, go across the street and have j
j a nut sundae, and call it quits."
But the bride-to-be had more j
I wisdom than to trade a man likel
William for a mere nut sundae.
