tions for Stanford games this year
as the Rally Committee made a final
plea to the student body last night
' to purchase rooters' tickets for the
U.S.C. game before they are placed
on sale to the general public to

At closing time yesterday, barely
: 1600 ducats had been purchased at
j the Board of Athletic Control build
' ing. They are sold at one dollar each
| plus a ten cent tax this year.
Big Opportunity
"We have one of the best teams
in years," said Chairman Bob
, Churchill of the Rally Committee
! late last night. "It is amazing to
see the measly turnout to watch this
wonder-team of ours. If we EVER
will beat Southern California, we
have the best chance this year!"
Year before last, according to of
ficial figures, more than 2800
rooters' tickets were sold for the
I game in the Stanford Stadium. Last
year more than 1200 Indian fans
joined the crusade to Los Angeles
to see the contest there.
This year, according to advance
' reports, Southern California is send
ing a huge vanguard of its enormous
student body to cheer the Trojans
on against the 1932 edition of the
| Big Red machine.
"In fact," added Churchill, "S.C.
i is sending up such a large crowd
j that even with a slightly larger sec
tion we might look sick in com
parison. We MUST get out there,
EVERY SINGLE STUDENT, to help
that Stanford team BEAT SOUTH
ERN CALIFORNIA!"

to complete the movement.
"We MUST have at least 2.000
rooters to do anything even satis
