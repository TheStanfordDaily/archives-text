# Forty Try Out For Posts On Daily Editorial Staff
## 
### 
At the first important meeting of ;
Ihe candidates for the Daily last j
night at 7:15, further signup of late !
tryoutees was held.
There arc 40 men and women en
rolled to compete for reporting po- j
sitions. Although this seems like a '
sufficient number, there is still room i
for more who are willing to cover I
the assignments, spend hours in the I
Daily office, and otherwise perform
the various tasks assigned to try- j
outees. If any still wish to sign J
up at the next meeting their lateness
will not be counted against them.
The next scheduled meeting is to- j
morrow at 7:15 in the Stanford Daily I
office.
