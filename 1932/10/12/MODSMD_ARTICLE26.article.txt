# JULIAN HUXLEY OPENS BIOLOGY LECTURE GROUP
## "Background" Is Subject Of First West Memorial Series Lecture EVOLUTION PORTRAYED Huxley To Speak On "The Uniqueness Of Man" 
### 
A remarkable picture of tiie "ac
cident" of human existence was
given by Julian Sorcll Huxley in
the first of the West Memorial Lec
tures last night.
Professor Huxley emphasized the
ditliculty of imagining life develop
ing to its present state in any other
way than it actually did.
An account of the physical condi
tions which were perfectly suited
to a planetary development suitable
for human life preceded a keenly
individual description by Professor
Huxley of the evolution of man. In
stead of the usual progressive, step
by-step outline, Professor Huxley
showed why "man: perceptual, self
conscious, could not have come about
unless he were terrestial, mamma
lian, bisexual, social, and weighing
between 10 and 1,000 pounds."
Because of the lecturer's own dis
tinguished heritage, a large As
sembly Hall audience listened with
rapt attention to any words even
remotely connected with evolution,
and heard Professor Huxley say
lhat progress was not a mysterious
thing, but only the inevitable result
of natural selection.
The direction and function of sci
ence, according to Professor Huxley,
should now be primarily to make
our internal environment more ef
ficient. Until now science has
worked almost entirely outwardly.
Today the human mind is taken for
granted, much as physical environ
ment was taken for granted in the
prescientifie period.
Professor Huxley's original plan
for the lectures: "Statics," "Dynam
ics," and the "Uniqueness of Man,"
was modified before the first lecture.
Last night's address was devoted to
"Background" . . . the remarkable
nature of the background and
setting for human life. Tonight's
lecture will discuss the subject orig
inally chosen for the iinal lecture,
"The Uniqueness of Man." The third
lecture will be of general scope and
■to some degree of summarizing na
ture.
Professor Huxley's lecture last night
was concluded with a discussion of
the place of religion in modern life:
In the past religion has been de
voted to one of two extremes: es
sentially to external environment or
almost entirely toward the inner
self. There is always danger of mak
ing religion too self-centered . . . .
withdrawn from society. Any re
ligion of the future will. Professor
Huxley stated, realize the "Kingdom
of Heaven" within us, not selfishly—
but only in its relation to society.
A practical example of the tragedy
of man's failure to conquer his in
ternal environment, though he may
have attained great advances in the
direction of external control, was
given by Professor Huxley when he
said: "Man, after conquering his
physical environment, is defeated,
temporarily perhaps, by the Frank -
ensteins of his own dreation: armies,
economic systems and the like."
When man has so conquered his in
ternal environment that such things
as booms and depressions may he
smothed out, an dan oven existence
achieved, progress in its truest sense
will be attained.
Tonight's lecture on the "Unique
ness of Man" will be at 7:30 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall. There will be
no admission charge.
