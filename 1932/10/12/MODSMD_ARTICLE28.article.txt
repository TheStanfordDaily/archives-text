# SLUMP THREATENS HEAD WAITERS
## 
### 
Old Man doom, or whoever il is that's been killing off
the sale ol tiekels, even rooters' tickets, for the forthcoming
gridiron classic between the Indians and Trojans, may
very possibly cast his sinister shadow upon the post-game
festivities in San Francisco. Unaccountable as the light
sale of rooters' tickets may have been, it seems to follow
logically, and tor the same obscure reasons, that the slump
in Stanford business will hit the city's better-known head
waiters as well. It doesn't seem probable that people who
aren't going to the game will be pepped up enough to cele
brate in San Francisco's famous hostelries that night.
Kven if the Cardinal contingent does decide to take in
the game and the traditional evening's hilarity in the city,
ii begins to look like a much cheaper party for all con
cerned than that of past S.C.-ganie nights. If the Farm
fellows don't trek cityward after the final whistle, the party
will be noisier and more hilarious than ever, no doubt, for
the hotels will be completely given over to the celebration
of their middle-aged patrons.
