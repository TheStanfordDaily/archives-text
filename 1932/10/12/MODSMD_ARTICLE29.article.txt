# TRADITION-BREAKING AT WESTWOOD
## 
### 
In the spirit of the doting mother who gently slaps her
small son on the wrist when lie gets into the jam in the
pantry, the Daily takes the liberty to cluck over the ter
rible disrepute the I'.C.L.A. "traditions" 1 have fallen into—
a situation that lias been uncovered by the editor of the
Daily /Iruin in a brilliant expose of the whole corrupt
busi ness.
I bis brave editor conducted a thorough investigation
of the entire campus, and great are the laxities he uncov
ered. lie sent a lowly reporter out to break all the "tradi
tions," and the bov went around all day, wearing four high
school pins, a high school ring, dressed in cords and a
high school sweater, trodding on sacred seals and virtually
thumbing his nose at every rule lie was supposed to obey.
And then the editor pointed a long finger and screamed
about "enforcement of traditions."
Now, isn't that horrible? Isn't it a burning shame that
nil those I.C.L.A. "traditions," hoary as they must be with
age, are being treated so nastily ? Tsk, tsk, freshmen. Thou
shall not Haunt Iby shirt I<»i Is when thy lords and masters,
the great ones, lay down the law and call it tradition. Go
to school and obey all the rules, and maybe some day after
< nougli years have gone by some magic wand will touch
those well-kept rules and endow them suddenly with that
spontaneous respect which any custom must have for years
and years before it can honestly be called a tradition.
Mavbe.
