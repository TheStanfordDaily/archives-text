# THE 						FOUR-YEAR PLAN DEFENDED
## 
### 
In a recent article in the Atlantic Monthly, President
Lowell of Harvard, who is considered one of the most ad
vanced educators in this country, defended the place of
the four-year undergraduate school in American education.
Dr. Lowell felt that the graduate school (of the type which
has been contemplated for Stanford) fails to provide the
proper environment because it lias become iilled with men
seeking degrees merely as "passports" to advancement in
teaching.
More stress. President Lowell believes, should be
placed on the requirements and standards of the four-year
course, so that our Bachelor's degrees might be on a par
with those of Europe. My sacrificing the four-year course,
the student loses thai intangible influence of culture, and
experience of living with bis fellow man, that is so essential
to the development of his character. In oilier words, a uni
versity's duly does not stop at merely turning out scholars.
For those who are distinctly fitted for the scholastic
life, and have demonstrated outstanding ability, President
Lowell suggests "Societies of Fellows" to be open to stu
dents after they have passed a certain period in college.
These "Societies'' would afford a congenial environment
for Ilit 1 real scholar and would also restrict the number of
those entering into the graduate fields.
There is a far 100 high percentage of inferior men
cluttering up the graduate schools today. The atmosphere
<>f these present graduate groups is not one that fosters
true scholarship. To assume that every college student is
capable of advanced graduate work is absurd and false,
unless the "advanced" work is made of an inferior brand.
