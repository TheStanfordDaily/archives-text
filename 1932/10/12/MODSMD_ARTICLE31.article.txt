# BULL SESSION
## SOPHOMORE DELIGHT 
### 
The first bright light on the social
horizon is the "Sophomore Cotillion."
It's still an embryo but is expected
to suddenly develop into a white
elephant if some sophomores have
their way Sbout it. The committee
has been appointed but as yet has
taken no final steps—from which
retraction would imply having made
a mistake. Therefore, suggestions
may now be in order before the
committee gets virulent cornmittee
itis—a devastating disease whose
cardinal symptom is: "God and the
committee know all and never err."
The easiest thing a dance commit
tee can do is spend money. Because
not only is it generally simple to
disburse coin of the realm — but
spending other people's spondulics—
is done with even greater facility.
The half-starved lawyers who year
ly sit in the legislature clearly prove
that.
As a result, the chief principle
that any dance committee should
first adopt is: " 'Tis greater honor
and costs less not to spend." Stan
ford has had orchestras from Holly
wood and San Francisco. There was
talk of bringing one from Chicago.
It is only natural that some sopho
mores should dream of scooping the
campus with some New York cele
brity—or maybe, even some Paris
darling. The committee should
clamp down! Not only in Ihe matter
of orchestras, but in all the other
features, the Class of '35 should
prove to the campus that the Ro
mans were wrong when they de

! fined "sophomore" as a wise fool.
While the stock market was mak
ing us all think we were wealthy— j
I and the politicians were proving it
—Stanford too got in the swim. The
price of our dances rose with the
! ticker. But having found out that
| this financial well of loveliness was
i only a mirage, it is plain simple to
j attempt a fast overhead crawl on a
I mud bottom! We not only have to
| retrench; we may have to trench
; and double trench.
The roughs used to dig deep and
produce. Now they just dig for the
i exercise. A high price Sophomore
I Cotillion is very likely to be a most
| dismal flop for the very obvious
| reason that the men will be unable '
|to buy bids. And a dance is not
usually considered a howling suc
i cess unless some tux-totcrs can be
somehow scraped together. But not
j only may it be necessary, it is right
j that the price should be slashed.
If the committee starts pulling a 1
, few wires instead of an equal num
! ber of opulent splurges—if they
| start shaking their heads east and
I west instead of the customary Holly
i wood direction of north and south j
! at every opportunity to prove that I
' they are the best little spenders on
the campus, the thing can be done. j
A very rococo Cotillion can be
I ushered in at about $2.50 a throw. ,
j After all $2.50 is enough when we

It's still an embryo but is expected
to suddenly develop into a white

their way Sbout it. The committee

The easiest thing a dance commit

not only is it generally simple to
disburse coin of the realm — but
spending other people's spondulics—
is done with even greater facility.
