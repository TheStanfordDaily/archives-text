THE BRIDE THE SUN SHINES
ON. (Will Cotton.) At the Cumin
Theatre.
Gordon Davis did wonders last
night with a thin vehicle, "The Bride
the Sun Shines On," which he suc
ceeded in presenting as a mildly
amusing comedy. If Will Cotton, au
thor and Vanity Fair caricaturist,
had the abilities of a Noel Coward,
the play might have been a good
prelude to "Private Lives," for the
same amorous bickering that is the
basis of Coward's delightful trifle
provides the theme of "The Bride."
The evening is by no means wasted
although the play begins slowly
and is inclined to drag slightly—a
blemish which Davis will no doubt

| remedy in post-premiere rehearsals.
The famous second act curtain line
was the biggest laugh of the eve
ning, and it would have been to the
; advantage of the production if Cot
: ton had built up an equally strong
j finish to his fading third act.
Laura Hope Crews, enthusiasti
cally received, had little to do in a
type part; Cyril Chadwick was in
much the same situation, carrying
his part off a* la Aubrey Smith. Irene
Purcell, as the stricken bride, dis
played an aptitude for comedy in
Ihe Joan Blondell manner, and was
admirably supported by Kenneth
MacKenna, in so far as he was able
to do anything with his part. Kath
leen Fitz, seen often in Junior
Operas here, had a bit. 8.0.8.
