While the stock market enjoyed
a fair technical rally yesterday, the
bond averages barely held steady.
The rally was accompanied by little
enthusiasm and represented some
short covering to avoid carrying
commitments over the holiday.
Stock fluctuations theoretically
indicate potential changes in earn
ing power, while the bonds repre
sent the basic asset worth of the
companies plus the ability to meet
fixed charges and ultimately pay or
refund the issue. That question
exists as to the ability of certain
companies to so take care of their
bonds is attested to by the far be
low par quotations for bonds of
such companies as Southern Pacific,
International Tel & Tel, N.Y. Cen
tral, Western Union, U.S. Rubber,
United Drug, etc.
News developments included a
hoist in mid-continental crude oil
12c to $1.12. The U.S. Treasury of
fering of ยง430,000,000 41/2 year 3%
notes was oversubscribed almost
20-1, revealing again that this coun
try is not afflicted with a shortage
of money but rather with the ques
tion of security. Wheat and cotton
markets were stronger.
Any market movements based on
election possibilities may now be
slightly bullish. Roosevelt's chances
are not on the up and up.
The writer again asserts that pres
ent levels of securities (limited
group!) offer exceptional investment
and speculative possibilities, bar
ring the chance that the country
departs from the gold standard. The
Exchanges are closed today.
