## THEY JUST HAPPEN TO LIVE ON ROW 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Ah, you poorly informed kibitzer,
1 writer of Bull-Session and other i
J pseudo-Winchellized non-entities,
you know not whereof you speak.
You accuse our Yell Leader and the j
Chairman of the Rally Committee of
political intrigue and "petty ma- |
; chinations." This, from the very na- I
ture of the appointments, is obvi
; ously untrue and we choose to prove 1
[ it in an unbiased manner.
This particular member of the j
; Feature Staff does not know "exact
ly why" a new Rally Comm. is
J necessary. We refer him to SEC- !
1 TION G of the Stanford Handbook, j
I Pethaps if he would take the trouble
j to look into the duties of the Rally
; Comm. he would revise his opinion
of what he terms a "Quasi-Gravy
i Train." They: 1. Provide entertain
j ment and supervise on Labor Day.
j 2. Sponsor all rallies. 3. Put on the
| Masque Ball. 4. Engineer Rooting
I Section stunts. 5. Arrange for re
-1 ceptions of notables. 6. Obtain en
| tertainment and facilities at many
j campus dances. 7. They give their
time free and to boot buy their own
: sweaters. The Committee is one of
j the hardest-working organizations j
! on the campus and receives very
little recognition as a body. As for
I returns! The only so-characterized
j "Gravy" is free admittance to the j
i U.S.C. and Big Games, a saving of
I two dollors, in return for which fa
i vol* they must work throughout the
games, not being paid as are ushers
j and program-sellers. The Committee
1 must work all year and is regarded
twice during one of the three quar
j ters!
The conductor of Bull-Session
i seems to be of the opinion that the
I appointments are prompted by po
! litical ambitions, or some such rot.
I The Comm. is free from politics. Its
I purpose is to gather together a
I group of students who will work
' harmoniously for a general benefit.
1 Even if the two appointing officers
do chance to be from the "Row,"
| they are still human enough to
! choose for members those they
know and those of whose genuine
j help and co-operation they are cer
[ tain. Where they live or what their
| connections make no difference.
I They do not act singly and run
around their various residences
'waving a Stanford banner and yell
j ing "rally." They might all live in
; New York, if they would still aid
i in choosing stunts and organizing
i various rallies and dances. There is
1 not such an amount of honor at
tached to the appointment as should
make men stand up and fight for
recognition.
The feature writer also notes with
mouth agape, that last year, with a
j Hall man president and a Hall man
' chairman, the Committee should
have been chosen with about a 50-
; 50 representation, "favoring the Row
1 a little, in fact." Could it be pos-
I sible that last year's chairman had
i an ulterior motive? Was he looking
| for votes from the Row to advance
! him to more exalted "political" of
| fice? We wonder? At least the pres
! ent appointing body is free from
j ulterior motives, and doesn't feel
! that it must be politically minded
! in its selection of its future col
| leagues.
! It seems to us that the Daily
I writer feels the matter of location

of residence a bit too strongly, and
has the bad taste to stir up politi
cal friction where none exists. We
are sure that when President Corbus
and the Ex-Comm. "get a crack at
the whole thing," ,they will view it
in an unbiased light, as they should,
and not feel that politics is the
basis of selection.
