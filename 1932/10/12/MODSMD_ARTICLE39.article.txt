# Varsity Soccer Stars Open Season in San Jose Today
## INDIAN SQUAD OUT TO RETAIN TITLE; BOASTS FEW VETS Maloney Makes Last-Day Shifts In Order To Bolster Defense 
### 
Through Stanford's year of ath
letic depression, there was one squad
that forgot all about hard times and
defeats and went ahead to win a I
championship. This was the 1931 j
soccer team, one of Harry Maloney's j
pet creations.
Today, down at San Jose, Coach '
Maloney brings forth his 19132 edi- !
tion. The unveiling is set for 4 j
o'clock when a team of eleven men,
only four of whom have ever had
any varsity experience, takes the
field to do buttle against San Jose
State, cellar team in last year's con
ference standings.
Brekelbaum at Goal
Hopes for another championship
will depend largely on the perform- j
ances of newcomers in the varsity j
lineup.
Coach Maloney did a little last
minute shifting yesterday afternoon
when he moved Erwin Brekelbaum,
veteran fullback, back to a position
at goalie. This post isn't entirely
new to "Breek," but whether or not j
he will make good cannot be guessed !
at this time, in as much as he didn't
get much of an opportunity to dis
play his wares against the second
string outfit yesterday. The regular
fulls and halves relieved Brekel
baum of a great deal of work, while
Ihe forwards managed to keep the j
ball down at the opponents' goal for i
most of the afternoon workout.
Washburn at Fullback
Switching "Breck" back to goalie ;
gave Laurie Washburn a chance to
step into a first-string job at full- j
back which he has long sought.
Washburn hasn't got complete j
monopoly on this position, however, j
for Coach Maloney has been favor- ;
ably impressed with the work of
Kelly Steele, fullback on last year's i
frosh eleven. "Nift" Branch will be'
the other full, while Milt Newman j
is the reserve goalie.
Alex Spohr will operate at center- I
half, with Doug Kennedy and |
Waddy White, former frosh, as the j
other halfbacks. Coach Maloney will !
take Bill Krumbein along on the
trip to back up these men.
Rely on Vets
Should the halves perform their j
assignment of feeding the ball to !
the forwards in top-notch fashion, |
the scoring duties will fall on the j
center combination of A1 Velarde, i
Art Hearn, and Cy Johnson. Hearn j
is Ihe only letterman of the trio, i
this being his second year as center I
forward.
Velarde and Johnson are both ex- j
pi rienced players, having played j
soccer for many years before com- !
ing to Stanford. Johnson, in addi
tion, was groomed for a varsity j
berth last year as an ineligible mem- j
her of the squad. Cas Rojas, from the j
frosh team, will probably share j
playing time with Velarde as he |
did in yesterday's scrimmage.
Knecht at Left
Carl Knecht, in his second year j
of varsity competition, will start at j
outside left, while Svcn Dodington j
will perform a.-> the other wing, j
Johnny T?oos may get into the game |
as Dodington's alternate.
The squad of sixteen men, Coach j
Maloney, and Manager Bob Wade j
will leave on a special bus at 2:30 !
o'clock.
