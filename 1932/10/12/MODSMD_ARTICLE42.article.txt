WITH STANFORD SHOWING
improved form every day, and
tiie rest of the conference mem
bers having, or about to have,
serious troubles, those wise boys
j who have been picking Cali
fornia and Southern California
to run one-two in the final
standings are beginning to have
a sneaking suspicion that the
Indians are the team to beat.
This may bring joy to the heart
j of the Oid Man; if there is anything
; he does NOT love to be, it is the
favorite. He has been going along
: without anybody worrying him and
I quietly building a team that has so
i far outshown even his own fond
! expectations. But after these un
j expected showings, he can hardly
hope to keep out of the public lime
i light. Ail the news hounds sniff a
j chance to upset the great El Trojan,
and they don't intend to be caught
napping.
BUT the thing that they must not
j forget is that Stanford has shown
i the most on defense so far, and al
| though U.S.C. hasn't the main force
! that it had last year, it nevertheless
| has one of the best lines in its his
i tory. The Cards are probably better
' on the ends, and that is all.

ONE OF THE UNRECORDED
engagements ancnt last Satur
day's contest was the four-

, round bout that Jake Irwin ,
staged with a fan, his wife and
daughter who had all left their
tickcts at home.
j The old gentleman wanted Jake j
I to escort them to the inner sanctum j
'of the stadium without further:
! quibbling, lest they miss part of the j
hectic struggle within. But Jake is j
j made of sterner stuff (he has SOLD i
j too many ducats to get hooked on:
' that old one) and he steadfastly re- |
! fused to budge.
Finally, just to get rid of the old!
| boy, he said that if they would send j
i him the three tickets they had left j
lat home he would refund their j
! money. MONDAY THE TICKETS'
ARRIVED!!!

JUST ABOUT IN THE SAME
CLASS is the one that the San |
Jose Mercury-Herald unwit
tingly pulled oji Clipper Smith,
the Santa Clara coach.
j They wanted a picture of Clipper ;
I with his arms outspread, so that j
they could graphically present his;
| new trick plays. The photographer i
backed Clipper up against the black
: board on the practice field, and
snapped him — with arms out- \
i stretched.
When the picture came out
Friday night, the blackboard
behind Smith had a diagram of
the play that was to beat Stan
ford. —R.D.W.Jr.
