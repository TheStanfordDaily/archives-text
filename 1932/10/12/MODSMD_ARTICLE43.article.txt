"Joseph Carl Oeschger"
That was the way the name read ,
! in the Academic Council's recom- j
mendation for degrees announced
yesterday. But to a baseball fan, it
should have been Joe Oeschger, for
mer major league star and the man
, who, by himself, pitched the longest
i game in Big Time circles.
j It was in 1920 that Oeschger,
! pitching for the Boston Red Sox, j
| then a real contender, took the i
mound and labored through 20 in- !
I nings before darkness stopped the |
game with Philadelphia in a 1-to-l I
deadlock. Loon Cadore, himself a
famous twirler in those days, went
the full route for the Phillies, and
matched Oeschger all the way. That
lacked one day of being a year after ,
Joe had won a 20-inning battle. j
Oeschger went up to the majors
with the Philadelphia Nationals in i
1915, and had the thrill of partici
i pa ting in his one and only world [
j series that same season. He was a
I teammate of Grover Clevelandj
, Alexander, who only recently re- j
I tired from active competition after '
i running around with the St. Louis j

j Cardinals in their world champion- j
j ship year and later playing with the ;
: Chicago Cubs.
Among other luminaries with |
j whom Big Joe has rubbed shoul- '
|ders in the majors are the immortal i
Christy Mathewson and Walter;
Johnson.
Since retiring from the big time, !
he has pitched semi-pro ball for the j
Chico nine in the Sacramento Val- !
ley League. During the last two :
' years he has been director of phys- '
j ical education at the Portola Junior
i High School in San Francisco.
] Oeschger lives with his wife at 724
i Bryant street, Palo Alto.
