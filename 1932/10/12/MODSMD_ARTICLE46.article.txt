# FROSH ELEVEN OVERCONFIDENT OF O.C.L.A. GAME
## Bruin Yearlings Outclass U.S.C. Rivals In Early Season Game 
### 
If overconfidence is any handicap
to a football team, Chuck Winter
burn's eleven is going to take an
awful wallopping in their game
against the U.C.L.A. yearlings Sat
urday.
The new freshman coach is mak
ing no secret about the worth of his |
material—that his 1932 yearlings are
five touchdowns better than last
year's team. Bui if Winterburn ex
pects to win Saturday's contest with
second- and third-string players, the
Bruin freshmen will have no trouble
in coming out of the fray on the
long end of the score.
Trobabes Weak
U.C.L.A. made a far better show
ing against Compton J.C. than did
Sam Barry's U.S.C. Trobabes—all
of the Los Angeles prep material j
that didn't migrate "to California,
Stanford, or Oregon preferred West
wood to Exposition Park.
This change of policy among j
Southern California's high-school
stars may be attributed, to a large j
measure, to the general athletic !
policy at U.S.C.
Goof Experience
A player coming to Stanford,
California, or U.C.L.A. with a me
diocre high-school record does little
[ playing in his freshman year, serves
! an apprenticeship of one or two
| seasons on the Goof squad, and
j eventually becomes first-class var
l sity material. But at U.S.C. there is
; a motto: "Once a Spartan, always
1 a Spartan!" For very few Trojan
players who do not make the varsity
! in their sophomore year have even
! a remote chance of getting above
the Spartan (Goof) squad.
Bernard Scott, a runner who had
been timed in a 4:27 mile at Mer
cersburg Academy, was cut off the
Trojan squad before he had been
' given a chance to show what he
1 could do, because the Eastern run
j ner's reputation had not reached
; Los Angeles.
Bruin Revival
Later in the season Scott defeated
! several of the U.S.C. varsity run
ners in an open track meet, but by
I that time the entry lists for the im
portant meets had been handed in,
: and Scott declared ineligible for the
; whole season.
All this accounts indirectly for
the athletic revival at U.C.L.A. . . .
so genuine'a revival, indeed, that
! unless a little of the cockiness dis-
