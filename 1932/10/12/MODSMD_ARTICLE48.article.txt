# TULANE'S VICTORIES OVER GEORGIA AND TEXAS AGGIES PROMISE STRONG ELEVEN
## 
### AL GUERARD 
Early-season victories over Texas
Aggies and Georgia indicate that
Tulane's Green Wave will be as
powerful as last year. The 1932
Wave is under a new coach, Ted
Cox, and though there are many
serious losses by graduation, the i
outstanding football record made by
Tulane in 1931 leads many experts
to place her team this year as the
best in the Southern Conference.
Tulane has three good backs in
Felts, Hodges, and Payne, and a
superlative triple-threat in the
great Don Zimmerman, who weighs
190 pounds and is as fleet as a deer.
Tulane's ability last season to run
in numerous backfield men who
were fine passers and puntei's gave
her a variety in offense which she
should retain this fall.
Ends Graduate
The great losses are Captain Jerry
Dalrymple, All-American end, and
Haynes, the greatest pass receiver
in the country last year. Many
Western experts who saw the two
Tulane ends play in the Rose Bawl
game thought that Haynes was the
better player.
| Tulane has no regular intersec-

tional games scheduled this year, j
but the Wave is still undefeated
after two hard games, so there is j
every reason to believe that she will
be as strong as last yeax*, possibly
strong enough to again be chosen
I as the Eastern representative in the
Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day.
Louisiana State appears to be the
strongest of the other Louisiana
I teams. Army orders shifted "Biff"
Jones, successful head coach at West
Point, to this small southern school,
and with reasonable luck, Jones
should make Louisiana State a real
threat within the next few years.
Their record so far this season has
been very fine; a one-touchdown
victory over the Centenary Gentle
men, and a gallant losing battle
! against Jake Meagher's fine Rice
j Institute eleven.
