# DEBATERS VOTE TO SPLIT TEAMS
## 50 Men On Varsity Squad; Will Argue Politics 
### 
Determined to thresh out the po
! litical situation to the satisfaction
j of any audience, 50 members of the
| men's varsity debate squad voted by
; an overwhelming majority last night
j to split the debate teams for com
j ing debates so that speakers from
: each school will speak on both sides
of the question.
Talk Politics
The political question to be ar
j gued by the college orators is, "Re
| solved, that the present administra
j tion should be retained in power."
| Under the policy adopted by the de
j bate squad, the Stanford speakers
j will be on both sides of the ques
i tion. One speaker will argue for
I Hoover and one for Roosevelt, the
two candidates on whom the debate
will hinge.
The first debate for the year is
scheduled as a dual encounter with
| the Univei'sity of California. Lee
! Emerson Bassett of the public
speaking department and the Cali
fornia coach came to an agreement
on the question and policy for the
debate.
Wolfe Speaks
i At the meeting last night, Joe
Wolfe, member-al-large of the Dc
j bate Council, acted as temporary
j chairman while the debate squad
j members aired their views in the
| forthcoming debates. In order to
| participate in the discussion, Wolfe
turned the chair over to Leonard
Bloom, who managed to bring some
| order out of the arguments.
One of the most important de
! bates of the fall season, as an
nounced by Leland Chapin, debate
I coach, is a triangular contest be
tween St. Mary's, California, and
I Stanford on the political question.
| Plans are being made to hold this
debate in San Francisco.
