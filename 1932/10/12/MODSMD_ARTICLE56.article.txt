Leonard Everett, '32, returned to j
the campus Friday with a story of ;
the unexpected trip to the Aleutian \
Islands which delayed his registra- I
tion a week.
Everett was on board the liner I
•'President Madison'' Tuesday, Sep- |
tember 26, when a call for help j
came from the freighter "Nevada," !
which had gone ashore on Amatig- |
nak Island. The "President Madi- j
son," bound for San Francisco, im
mediately left its course and
steamed to the rescue.
On Friday the liner arrived, find
ing the Japanese steamer "Oregon j
Maru," which had had one lifeboat j
smashed in a rescue attempt. There j
were but three survivors of the j
"Nevada," marooned on the island. J
These were taken off by the "Presi- 1
dent Madison's" crew after a sailor \
had made an heroic swim through |
the boiling surf with a lifeline.
"We had to circle around and ;
start back in order to stop," Everett j
said yesterday, "and the poor men j
thought we didn't see them. They j
ran wildly back and forth waving I
newspapers to attract our atten- i
tion."
