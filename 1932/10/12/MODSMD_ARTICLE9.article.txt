# Frosh Appoint Mudfight Chief
## 
### 
Dean Kendall was elected captain
of the freshman mud fight forces
last night at a meeting of the first
year men in Encina Hall. Aylett
Cotton, former president of the
Class of '35, has already been ap
pointed leader of the sophomore
forces in tomorrow's battle.
Both leaders are relying on the
size of their turnouts to determine
tho winner rather than on any par
ticular scheme of organization. Due
to the scattered living conditions
and relatively small size of the
sophomore class, Cotton urges every
sophomore who can possibly do so
to be on hand. Day students and
transfers arc especially urged to
turn out.
Charlie Karl. Ray Wilbur, and
Ben Eastman, Encina sponsors, have
been appointed to take charge of
the fight tomorrow.
