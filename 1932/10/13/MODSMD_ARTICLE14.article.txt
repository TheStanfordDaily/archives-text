# HUXLEY TELLS UNIQUENESS OF HUMAN SPECIES
## Final "Biology And Human Nature" Series Talk Given Tonight 
### 
â€” I
Man is biologically unique in three
ways: the variation displayed within
the single species, the qualities of
his mind and his background. The
second of these is the most important
for it determines the first.
From this thesis Julian Sorell
Huxley delivered the second of the
West Memorial Lectures last night,
speaking on '"The Uniqueness of
j Man." The audience was as large
| and even more attentive than on
the opening night. The final lecture
of the "Biology and Human Nature"
series will be given at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. It will concern the relation
ship of the individual and society to
science and morals.
Mind More Fluid
j Professor Huxley stated that it is
j the greater fluidity of the human
j mind that crystallized man's unique
| ness, giving rise as it does to con
-1 ceptual thought. Conceptual thought
! in turn gave birth to language and
i tradition, and also promoted the de
j veloprnent of abstract ideas and goals
| for conduct.
Tradition itself is a biologically
! unique thing as it constitutes a social
1 form of heredity operating side by
| side with the true biological form
! of heredity.
| Another unique characteristic of
; the human species is the large part
I in man's life played by incertitude,
j another consequence of human
I plasticity. This incertitude gives
j birth to intellectual indecision, prac
l tical vacillation, emotional conflict,
! and suspended judgment.
Other Evidence
Professor Huxley described the
human tendency towards unity,
the propensity toward continuous
! growth, and man's substitution of
I conscious means and conscious pur
j pose for habit and instinct, as other
evidences of the uniqueness of man.
Professor Huxley classified the
: three main stages of life as the pre
rational, the rationalizing, and the
i rational.
\ The pre-rational stage may al
-1 ways be realized when there is ap
i peasement of a sense of guilt by the
j mere fact of suffering, penance, or
; punishment, irrespective of its rea
sonableness or the likelihood of its
permanent efficacy. In other words,
| during the pre-rational stage con-
I fiict is solved emotionally.
In the rationalizing stage conflict
I is still solved emotionally, but the
; solution justified itself with the aid
!of reasons. War and punishment on
criminals are justified by rationaliza
j tion.
The Kational
The rational, according to Profes
j sor Huxley, in the final outcome
j rejects all absolute solutions and re
mains obstinately relativist.
A short but illuminating discussion
j of eugenics was given by Professor
Huxley. Practical eugenic measures,
| except such as sterilization of mental
j defectives, are not urgent. What is
I urgent, however, is that the eugenic
' idea should permeate the common
I consciousness, for this is necessary
I to extend the conception of rational
I development to its limit.
