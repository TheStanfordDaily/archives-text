The campus dance is favored by .
i Miss Mary Yost, dean of Stanford |
| women.
j Favored because it mingles the !
I students, and is not costly, Miss Yost !
; said yesterday. She added a plea for '
! a card and game room adjoining the
I dance floor.
The Dean of Women said, "I can't
| see why dancing under proper con- j
j ditions isn't a very sane and whole- \
I some method of entertainment. Of !
| course there are some dances which j
' lend themselves to bad dancing more I
; than others, but when we have aj
j student body whose interest is in j
j doing the decent Ihing, as at Stan- 1
j ford, we can safely say that dancing
i is desirable.
j "The only trouble we ever had at
! Stanford about dancing was a few i
i years ago when the "Chicago" struck
1 the campus like the measles. It was ;
la good thing the attack was violent'

because it brought immediate action, j
| The student body wouldn't stand for j
I it. After the Sophomore Cotillion, j
! the Men's Council and Women's I
! Council immediately passed resolu- '
; lions against the dance."
Miss Yost believes that Ted Shawn, ,
world-famous dancer, is correct in j
his statement that "there is no such
j thing as a bad or immoral danceâ€”
| only bad or immoral dancers." In
this connection she says: "If the I
| dance committee will be careful to '
I suppress individual bad dancers, !
| dancing is something to encourage !
| rather than prohibit."
Dean of Men George Culvpr com- j
mcnts as follows: "I consider danc- j
j ing as a part of the social training j
lof the University. Of course, it I
i should be regulated as it is now. I j
do think, however, that 1 o'clock I
dances are a little too long. The last
' hour passes too slowly."
