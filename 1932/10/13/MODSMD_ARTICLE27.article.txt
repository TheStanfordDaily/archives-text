# Reserves Will Open Tilt With Army Saturday
## Pop May Have to Use Some of Varsity Squad; Game Will Decide Final Second, Third Team Ranking; Allen, Afflerbaugh May Bid for First 
### 
J7XPECTING to be forced to use at least a few of liis varsity eleven, luit
at the same time hoping to sneak a victory over the West Coast Army
Saturday with nothing but second- and third-stringers, Pop Warner an
nounced his opening lineup last night, made up entirely <>f reserves.
With Stanford's second- and third-stringers about on a par Saturday's
lineup can be considered neither thdi best reserve squad nor a third-string
outfit. There are plenty of men whose names do not appear who will
probably see much action before the afternoon is over. This should give

Pop a fairly good idea of just who
are the eleven men who can be
classed as understudies to the var
sity.
Lineup Announced
The complete lineup for Saturday
follows:

Left end—Dave Packard
Left tackle—Ben Palamountain
Left guard—Fred Scribncr
Center—Lee Blanchard
Right guard—Red Targhetta
Right tackle—Jack Holvverda
Right end—JelT Minckler
Quarterback —Dusty Allen
i Left halfback—Buck Van Delicti
Right halfback —Ken AiTlerbaugh
Fullback—Jay Stevens

Not only will Pop discover who
are the best reserves among the
above and a dozen others who wil!
get into the game, but he may find
a few who will make serious bids
| for varsity berths. Dusty Allen and
I Ken Afflerbaugh are in such a cate
gory and can be counted on to make
a brilliant showing in the backfield.
Allen is remembered for his good
work last year in heaving passes but
up until the present time he has not
lived up to that record. But Dusty
has been back in his old form dur
ing practice this week.
Afflcrhaugh Fast
Afflerbaugh as a reserve last year
also gave the fans a few thrills by
his open field running. This year he
was first placed in the tough posi
tion of understudy to Ernie Caddel
and then switched over to left half
when Bob Maentz was lost because
of an injury.
In this berth Kenny found that
Bill Sim was his chief rival. So in
I alternating between the two posts
Afflerbaugh was unable to see much
action. But watch Mr. Afflerbaugh
this Saturday.
Should Warner get by the Jar
heads without sending in his varsity
there will no doubt be injected into
the lineup a few more faces un
familiar to Card fans. Thorney
Rogers, Rusty Maino, Chuck Rog
ers, and John Card aie dependable
linemen waiting to mix it up. In
the backfield there is Chuck White,
who took part in part of last Satur
day's tilt with Santa Clara.
Varsity Scrimmages
With next week's Trojan game in
mind, Warner started to limber up
his pet eleven last night in dummy
scrimmage. Ernie Caddel took part
in the workout for the first time
this week although he has been out
in uniform since Monday. On the
other hand, Bill Bates was standing
around in civilian clothes after ap
pearing in a suit the day before.
Eliminating comparative scores,
I the most accurate comparison be
tween the Cards and Trojans was
J voiced by members of the Oregon
State squad after their game with
! U.S.C. last Saturday The concen
j sus of opinion among the varsity
men was that the Trojan line was
just as strong as the Card line but
that the cards had a slight edge in
the backficld. They declined to say,
! however, who they thought would

win.
Southern California still has those
relics of past college glories, the
literary societies. Aristoleian and
Athena are the classical names of
two of them.

pearing in a suit the day before.
Eliminating comparative scores,
I the most accurate comparison be
tween the Cards and Trojans was
J voiced by members of the Oregon
State squad after their game with
! U.S.C. last Saturday The concen
j sus of opinion among the varsity
men was that the Trojan line was
just as strong as the Card line but
that the cards had a slight edge in
the backficld. They declined to say,
! however, who they thought would

win.
Southern California still has those
relics of past college glories, the
literary societies. Aristoleian and
Athena are the classical names of
two of them.
J7XPECTING to be forced to use at least a few of liis varsity eleven, luit
at the same time hoping to sneak a victory over the West Coast Army
Saturday with nothing but second- and third-stringers, Pop Warner an
nounced his opening lineup last night, made up entirely <>f reserves.
With Stanford's second- and third-stringers about on a par Saturday's
lineup can be considered neither thdi best reserve squad nor a third-string
outfit. There are plenty of men whose names do not appear who will
probably see much action before the afternoon is over. This should give

Pop a fairly good idea of just who
are the eleven men who can be
classed as understudies to the var
sity.
Lineup Announced
The complete lineup for Saturday
follows:

Left end—Dave Packard
Left tackle—Ben Palamountain
Left guard—Fred Scribncr
Center—Lee Blanchard
Right guard—Red Targhetta
Right tackle—Jack Holvverda
Right end—JelT Minckler
Quarterback —Dusty Allen
i Left halfback—Buck Van Delicti
Right halfback —Ken AiTlerbaugh
Fullback—Jay Stevens

Not only will Pop discover who
are the best reserves among the
above and a dozen others who wil!
get into the game, but he may find
a few who will make serious bids
| for varsity berths. Dusty Allen and
I Ken Afflerbaugh are in such a cate
gory and can be counted on to make
a brilliant showing in the backfield.
Allen is remembered for his good
work last year in heaving passes but
up until the present time he has not
lived up to that record. But Dusty
has been back in his old form dur
ing practice this week.
Afflcrhaugh Fast
Afflerbaugh as a reserve last year
also gave the fans a few thrills by
his open field running. This year he
was first placed in the tough posi
tion of understudy to Ernie Caddel
and then switched over to left half
when Bob Maentz was lost because
of an injury.
In this berth Kenny found that
Bill Sim was his chief rival. So in
I alternating between the two posts
Afflerbaugh was unable to see much
action. But watch Mr. Afflerbaugh
this Saturday.
Should Warner get by the Jar
heads without sending in his varsity
there will no doubt be injected into
the lineup a few more faces un
familiar to Card fans. Thorney
Rogers, Rusty Maino, Chuck Rog
ers, and John Card aie dependable
linemen waiting to mix it up. In
the backfield there is Chuck White,
who took part in part of last Satur
day's tilt with Santa Clara.
Varsity Scrimmages
With next week's Trojan game in
mind, Warner started to limber up
his pet eleven last night in dummy
scrimmage. Ernie Caddel took part
in the workout for the first time
this week although he has been out
in uniform since Monday. On the
other hand, Bill Bates was standing
around in civilian clothes after ap
pearing in a suit the day before.
