# RUSHING TOWARD THE BRINK
## 
### 
\\ omen s rushing, llial ritualistic, dignified process by
which Stanford's nine sororities receive their yearly trans
fusions ol new blood, lias traditionally been a quiet, law
abiding affair in comparison with the chaotic disorder of
fraternity pledging. Like a maternal guardian, Pan-
Hellenic has always guided the activities of her nine fosler
<ialighters, laying down rules lor them to observe, preserv
ing sportsmanship and fair play in their great rushing
game. It must be added that Pan-Hellenic has achieved
singular success in this role of arbiter and dictator in
recent years.
Ihe women's rushing game grows continually more
complicated, however, with new restrictions constantly
being born in the Pan-Hellenic mind. The three latest
restrictive ideas, not as yet formally enacted, are particu
larly petty and technical. I hey torhid a house to send
more than one member to accompany the freshman woman
to Roble after a rushing date, to telephone a freshman
woman for any reason whatsoever, or to ask her to break
a previously arranged rushing date with another house.
These three rules, or ideas for rules, seem to make ef
fective and intensive rushing next to impossible, if a soro
ity wishes to remain strictly "within the law." If they are
accepted by the Pan-Hellenic body and broken frequently,
as they most likely would be, the entire structure of the
sorority rushing system would be threatened with collapse.
It's a strange thing that Pan-Hellenic hasn't profited by
the sad experience of the Interfraternity Council last year.
Over-legislation, just such petty restrictions as these now
proposed for the sororities, were responsible for the break
down of the men's rushing system.
Take a tip from the fraternities, Pan-Hellenic. Keep
the rules simple, and few.
