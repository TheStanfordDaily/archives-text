While Germany's howls for armament parity with
Prance are bringing to a boil, on the eve of yet another
conl erence, Ihe always-bubbling European armaments
cauldron, all is apparently quiet on the Stanford front.
Behind the front, however, if this otlice might be
visioned as such, all is decidedly not quiet. Pamphlets,
letters, pictures, and picas, all espousing the cause of pa
cificism, daily come through the mails to clutter up the
editorial desk.
Admitted the cause is worthy enough. And undoubt
edly it is necessary for the pacifist to take an offensive.
Hut it is not the purpose of the Daily at this time to go
verbose in a discussion of a problem that most college
students have heard hashed and rehashed almost con
stantly since the war.
Ihe present beef is just this. That promoters of pa
cifism, while unconsciously overplaying their propaganda,
are not calling their shots properly and are therefore work
ing an effect opposite to the one intended.
Instead of allowing an already sensibly (as distin
guished from rabidly) pacitistic newspaper go pcacefullv
on its way, these over-zealous promoters, through inces
sant and prolonged hammering on war, war, down with
war, are coming dangerously near to arousing a bellicose
altitude where once all was peaceful.
Again, gentlemen call vour shots.
