After ;i long Ii 14111 Dink Tcmpleton is once more up and
around. The atmosphere of (lie press box last Saturday
had a very special quality. The old timers remarked about
it. The newcomers commented on it. In fact everyone
there was genuinely happy to sec Dink in his old accus- |
tomcd place. Out at the old oval track men feel the same j
way when they see a familiar car drive up by the stands. I
Stanford's home bred coach is looking the prospects over !
at the accustomed stand!
I he Dvu.v, for one, was overjoyed to see how well
Dink Tcmpleton looked. Although not completely recov- j
i red, the sparkle and lire in Dink's eyes gives fair warning
to the bugs that have been attacking him that they are now
under control and might as well give up a battle which
they came so near to winning several times. The spirit that
got Dink Tcmpleton out of his sick bed in his senior year!
at Stanford so that a MiMeet should not be lost, and the
spirit that has brought fame and glorv to Tcmpleton
coached teams never had a greater test than during the |
past year. II is a real tribute to Dink, the man, that lie is
with us again.
