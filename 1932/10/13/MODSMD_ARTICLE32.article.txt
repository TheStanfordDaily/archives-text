# BULL SESSION
## . . . AND THE AXE FELL 
### 
And the axe fell. And the heads I
soon followed. And justice was done.
And there was general rejoicing on
the Farm. Furthermore, Student
body President Corbus and the Ex
Committee deserve great praise for
the swift execution of what must
have been a very unpleasant task.
Be-headings are often necessary but
not exactly enjoyable occupations.
There was squealing and whimper
ing; but the Executive Committee
saw its duty and done it.
The present Rally Committee ratio
between Hall and Row is not mathe
matically even; but of course no one !
ever maintained that it had to be. :
Just a rough approximation is all j
that is necessary; and the present i
score of 17 for the Greeks to 12 for '■
the Halls, is near enough to satisfy |
most people. The degree of change j
that was initiated is evident that the
tentative list gave the Halls only
half of their present number.
And very few people seem to !
think that the future of the Rally !
Committee has been ruined. The j
new members will probably fit into |
the organization with about the ,
same degree of inconspicuosity that
will characterize the members gen
erally. The Rally work will go on
as usual; and an odoriferous vapor
has been blown clear of the campus.
And what is still more important,
the precedent for selfish Hall-Row
division has been happily avoided, j

And about a certain Campus
Opinion article appealing yesterday.
. . . Definitions of "Kibitzer" vary.
Taking the kindest meaning—and I
am sure that those two deft word
artists and logic-mongers—would
only desire me to take the least
harsh interpretation—a kibitzer is
one who fails to keep his eyes eter
nally focused on his own gravy
spots. If that is the definition, I
plead guilty.
If a kibitzer is one who presumes
to find fault with what should be
the "public-service" activities of
campus officers, then the finger
points in my direction. If a fetid
flatus is about, we plan to nose
about even though we are reason
ably sure the odor is caused by
others. In fact, if we are positive
that somebody else is causing the
unhealthy campus aroma, we might
even then evidence curiosity.
Of course, no one blames the two
would-be vitrol-atomizers. If one's
friends are involved; and if one
cares more about one's friends than
about the campus generally, it is
only natural to grow warm about
the collar, and devastatingly humor
ous in the regions of the typewriter.
In fact, I can imagine myself, in
spite of what the Ex-Comm. finally
decided, reasoning in circles until I
became dizzy—if I thought persons
more important than principles.

. . . Definitions of "Kibitzer" vary.
Taking the kindest meaning—and I
am sure that those two deft word
artists and logic-mongers—would
only desire me to take the least
harsh interpretation—a kibitzer is
one who fails to keep his eyes eter
nally focused on his own gravy
spots. If that is the definition, I
plead guilty.
If a kibitzer is one who presumes
to find fault with what should be
the "public-service" activities of
campus officers, then the finger
points in my direction. If a fetid
flatus is about, we plan to nose
about even though we are reason
ably sure the odor is caused by
others. In fact, if we are positive
that somebody else is causing the
unhealthy campus aroma, we might
even then evidence curiosity.
Of course, no one blames the two
would-be vitrol-atomizers. If one's
friends are involved; and if one
cares more about one's friends than
about the campus generally, it is
only natural to grow warm about
the collar, and devastatingly humor
ous in the regions of the typewriter.
In fact, I can imagine myself, in
spite of what the Ex-Comm. finally
decided, reasoning in circles until I
became dizzy—if I thought persons
more important than principles.
