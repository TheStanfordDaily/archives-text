MAN CALLED BACK (Tiffany)—]
At the Now Mcnlo Theatre.
Conrad Nagel plays the part of a j
skillful surgeon who lost his nerve. '
A drifter in the South Seas, he's
picked up by a wealthy Englishman, !
whose life he saves.
It would have been an excellent
show if the plot had ended with his 1
return to London sponsoi'cd by his j
benefactor, but unfortunately, after 1
the proper climax has been reached, !
a murder trial is suddenly intro- ;
duced. The result is a sort of a dis- |
pleasing double plot with the two
parts connected very slimly, neither
one apparently needing the other, j
The weak plot aside, the picture
is good because the actors show j
talent. John Hallidiiy, praised for ;
his work with Joan Bennett in
"Week-Ends Only," is even better ■
as the suave English benefactor, and ,
once or twice, he introduces some J
fine dramatic anger.
Doris Kenyon is colorless. This is i
largely the fault of the direction i
and the lines given her. The sue- '
cessful change from a "lost man" J
in the South Seas to a London sur- i
geon proves Nagel's ability.
Among the shorts there is an in
teresting newsreel of California
events, including Stanford football J
practice. —J.H.G.

Hotel.
It is constantly argued on the one i
side that a critic should be kindly |
toward any amateur production and j
on the other that, allowing a cer- ,
tain amount for the inexperience i
and lack of staging facilities, that j
he treat them as he would any pro
fessional company.
I am consequently in something |
of a quandary when I find it neces- j
sary to comment upon the produc- I
tion by Lucille Gordon and Company ■
of a new play called "License."
In its current state the piece needs |
a tremendous amount of re-writing J
and smoothing to eliminate the un
believable emotional changes which j
the characters — particularly the;
leading lady—are called upon to un
dergo.
Richard Allen, a stock actor, di
rected the production and did an
abdominable job, particularly in the
light of his professional experience.

The business was crude in the last
degree from the postures of the
players—an excusable error consid
ering the relative inexperience of
the cast —to the exits and entrances
—a matter in no way excusable un
der a director who has been on the
stage as long as Allen has. Too, he
acted his role as if bored with the
whole affair.
Lucille Gordon, obviously under
going a tremendous nervous strain,
did what little she could with the
leading role. It is at present an im
possible one to act convincingly. In
type roles Ari Lorenz, Patricia
Geissler, Joseph Rysson—barring a
long stride common to most of the
players which only emphasized the
minuteness of the stage—and Starr
Dunmad were the more convincing
members of the cast. —J.S.S.
