Four weeks under the new rules
have drawn the approval of Pop
Warner for the revised regulations
governing football.
"Very satisfactory," was the terse
comment the Old Fox made. "The
rules have taken nothing from the
game," he added, "and they have
increased the player's safety from
injuries."
It's a little early for basketball,
but men not out for autumn sports
are beginning to get busy under
Coach John Bunn. 11' you fall in that
cagey class, drop around to the
Pavilion some afternoon and sign up.
Second thoughts—l wonder
how IJ.S.C. feels being rated as
the underdog for the Stanford
game . . . and liow Stanford
feels being on the long end . . .
and what psychological effect
(that's always a good phrase)
it will have on the Cards . . .
and wliat kind of a time St.
Mary's could give the Trojans
this year . . .
This West Coast Army eleven
is no bunch of cream puffs . . .
it's liable to be lIARDTACKIing
them Saturday . . . Yazir, as the
Old Microbe would say ... if
Stanford can beat the Jarheads
without losing any men ... it
might be a rosy afternoon on
October 22—rain or no rain.
Too bad Stanford can't afford a
crew. With U.C.L.A. taking advan
tage of what the Oympie Games
brought, it looks as if a few more
seasons will see the birth of a
Pacific Coast regatta. The Trojans
(if they can scrape up a little more
cash) might go into their shells and
provide a lot of local rivalry in Los
Angeles.
Up north, Washington might be
able to lend a little moral assistance
to either or all of W.S.C., Oregon,
or Oregon State.
Football has its heated and color
ful rivalry, but there's something
about a regatta that beats 'em all.
Maybe it's the free admission.
