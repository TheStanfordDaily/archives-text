# Soccermen Gain Early Lead To Down San Jose
## VARSITY TALLIES TWICE; SPARTANS GET LONE SCORE Team Shows Practice Lack In Second Half; Fails At Many Set-ups 
### Bob Wade 
Scoring twice in the first half, and !
I then clinging tenaciously to this lead !
1 until the final minutes when San
; Jose tallied its lone marker, Stan
; ford's varsity soccer squad got off
i to a shaky start in defense of its
I championship yesterday when it
i downed a surprisingly strong San j
j Jose State Teachers College team
I 2 - L
After battling up and down the
I field with little advantage on either
I side, the forward wall finally got to
! gether long enough to get the ball
■ in scoring position and Cy Johnson,
j inside right, banged the ball through.
Score Second Goal
That was all for the first twenty
i minutes, but after a few more ex
i changes, the Indians again started
! the wheels rolling, and again John
i son responded with a goal.
The Cards had numerous chances
| to score in the second half, but their
i lack of practice began to tell and one
set-up after another went by without
a score.
Considering that it was their first
battle of the season, that they have
been out for only a week and a half,
j that San Jose was much stronger
' than expected, and that most of the i
! team is composed of inexperienced i
I men, the Card varsity kickers did 1
j remarkably well.
Fullbacks Star
j One of the most gratifying per
i formances was that of Coach Ma- |
] loney's new fullbacks, Nif Branch J
J and Larry Washburn. Branch was j
I an ineligable freshman last year, and j
' Washburn has failed to show any- j
thing since his yearling days, but \
yesterday these two were all over j
the field on offense and defense.
San Jose's lone tally came as the I
result of a doubtful roughing pen- '
alty, and was put through by the
Spartan's center forward, Leslie.
The kick was close, and goalie Brek- 1
elbaum almost got his hands on it
in time.
Other than this, their one real
crack at the Indian goal, the Staters I
| were unable to get behind Stanford's
i fullbacks. Even when Maloney,
! started sending in substitutes, near j
the end of the contest, San Jose was
unable to get a shot at the net. The
• scrubs made up in fight what they
lacked in experience.
