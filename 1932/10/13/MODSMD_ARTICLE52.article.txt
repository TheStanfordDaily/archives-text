# TENNESSEE U'S GREAT FOOTBALL RECORD MENACED; LOSS OF VETERANS IS BLOW
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Football greatness is a tradition at I
the University of Tennessee; Major j
Robert R. Neyland's teams have |
won fifty-four victories and suf- j
fered but two defeats over a span i
of six years.
It is this almost matchless record
that may finally prove Tennessee's i
undoingâ€”every one of the South- j
ern Conference teams feels that a ;
victory over the Volunteers would j
make their own season a success, i
Whereas Coach Neyland's eleven I
must coast through early season
games and focus entire attention on !
three major battles, Tennessee's op- |
ponents invariably point to their j
"Big Game" against the Volunteers, i
Regulars Lost
Seven of Tennessee's 1931 regu- '
lars have been lost by graduation, i
including Gene McEver, All-South
ern halfback; Herman Hickman, All -
American guard; and Ray Saunders, !
All-Southern tackle.
Malcolm Aitken, tackle, captains .
the 1932 eleven, which appears to
have less-experienced material than
any Vol eleven since 1928. This
year's squad, however, will average
a few pounds heavier than the 1930
and 1931 teams. Four juniors are
expected to be outstanding players '
this year: Beattie Feathers, half- \
back; Dike Bracket!, quarterback; j
Milton Frank, guard; and Talmage j

Maples, center.
Tennessee fears most Kentucky,
Alabama, and Vanderbilt. During
the Neyland regime (since 192G),
Kentucky has been a jinx for Ten
nessee. The Wildcats battled them j
to a scoreless tie in 1928, and ruined
championship hopes in 1929 and ]
1931 with G-6 ties.
Next Saturday the Vols travel to
Birmingham for their annual game
with Alabama. While Tennessee was
winning from Mississippi University |
and North Carolina, 33-0 and 20-7, >
Alabama swamped Mississippi Col
lege, 53-0, and outclassed George
Washington University 28-6.
Major Neyland rightly fears Van- ;
derbilt. He believes "Stanford
of the South" has the heaviest and
most experienced team in America.
Vanderbilt Threatens
The mystery of Vanderbilt's j
strength will be uncovered Saturday :
afternoon, when the Nashville eleven !
travels to New Orleans to face Tu- |
lane University in the most import- :
ant game on the national schedule, j
Other major Southern Conference
games this week-end include Geor- |
gia Tech.-Auburn (a toss-up), Duke |
vs. Maryland, Georgia vs. North j
Carolina, Kentucky-Washington and j
Lee, and Virginia Poly vs. William ;
and Mary.
Vanderbilt University will be dis- |
cussed in tomorrow's Daily.
