# star halfbacks ON FROSH SQUAD AID GRID CHANGES
## Powerful Reserves Mark 1932 Yearlings In Grid Victories 
### 
Three men are fighting for the j
post of left halfback on the Stanford I
freshman football team. This has
been largely accountable for the j
success of the yearlings in winning j
over mediocre opposition in the first
four games of the season.
The three left halfbacks are Bobby
Grayson ,a riot in Portland, Oregon,
high-school football; Johnny Reis- !
ner of Commerce High, San Fran- |
cisco, and Bill Bronstein. When one \
of these flcct-footcd runners begins I
to slow up, Winterburn injects an- !
other of the trio, enabling the In
dians to play at full tempo through
out the game.
Missing Link
Reserve strength is something that
Stanford yearling teams of past j
years have lacked. As long as the i
starting lineup could stay in the
game, the Indians would keep up
with the opposition, but when fa
tigue or injuries forced substitu
tions, the Stanford players would
become discouraged, and their of
fense would go to pieces.
Last year the Class of '35 out
fought and outplayed the California
freshmen for three and a half quar
ters, but finally broke down from
sheer exhaustion as they watched
the Bears trot in one substitute af
ter another of apparently equal abil
ity to the first-stringers.
Many Right Halves
The right halfback this year, Bones
Hamilton, is strong enough to play J
a whole game, but even he has j
capable reserve material to back |
him up in Mallatratt, Niccolls,
Mackroth, and Vierling.
The tremendous reserve power of
the freshmen is particularly evident
at the fullback position where
Frank Alustiza, a great player at !
Stockton High, holds the first-string
berth over Bill Morgan of Portland.
David Sears, the third-string full
back, was a big star at Vallejo High
last yeai\ and he is slill a very good
player, but Winterburn has not yet j
given him much chance to play.
Good Quarterbacks
Earl Iloos is rated as the best |
quarterback because of Ray Todd's j
habit of calling one or two bad plays J
each game, 'out this is something 1
that experience will iron out, and 1
eventually Todd will probably be
very goood varsity material. Roy
Lewis, a younger brother of San j
Francisco University's "Spud," is the I

third quarterback, and a very peppy I
but light is the'third quarterback,!
and a very peppy but light player. !
Lewis is a little light for blocking 1
duties, and rather careless throwing j
passes. Another quarterback, Heine 1
Rolph, is a nephew of Governor |
Rolph. He is a very hard-working j
player but he is far too light to be j
of any value in collegiate football j
circles.
