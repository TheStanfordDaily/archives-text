# LAW SOCIETY TO INCLUDE GRABS
## Kiesling Will Head New Placement Group 
### 
Headed by Francis V. Keesling,
prominent San Francisco attorney,
an executive committee of seven
members of the Stanford Law So
ciety was last night appointed to
study the placing of law students
in permanent and summer positions.
The council of the law society,
meeting at dinner in the Union din
ing room, also voted to start a mem
bership campaign. It was pointed
out that only a small percentage of
the Stanford lawyers in northern
California are at present members
of the society. The society wishes
to expand to include all graduates
of the Stanford School of Law prac
ticing in northern California.
Justice Homer Spence of the Dis
trict Court of Appeal presided at
last night's meeting of the council,
which was attended by 15 members
of the 25 composing the body. Fran
cis V. Keesling, president of the or
ganization, is absent on a trip to
the East.
The council, considering the pub
lication of a directory of Stanford
lawyers, voted to postpone action in
the matter indefinitely.
Following the meeting, members
of the council met with the students
of the law school at their annual
smoker held at 8 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Francis Price, prominent Santa
Barbara attorney, furnished the
highlight of the program when he
gave an illustrated lecture embody
ing his personal experiences in con
nection with the famous Mexican
murder case of Rosalie Evans.
Lucien Shaw, president of the
student law association, made an
address of welcome to the first-year
students of the law school. Professor
M. R. Kirkwood, dean of the school,
also spoke briefly, welcoming the
barristers-to-be.
Ansel Williams, head of this year's
moot court board, advised the group
of the regulations which will govern
the moot court tournament. To
compete in the tournament, moot
lawyers must argue their cases in
teams of two. The tournament is
open to second- and third-year stu
dents only.
