# GRAY ELEVEN MAKES IMPRESSIVE SHOWING AGAINST SAN JOSE SQUAD
## 
### 
Completely outclassing Dud De-
Groot's San Jose State Teachers, the
Stanford Grays had things pretty
much their own way both on offense
and defense last night in a scrim
mage held on the local field.
Although the scrimmage was en
tirely of a practice nature, with no
figures kept as to yardage gained,
the Grays easily had a big edge,
gaining almost at will. On defense

they either held the Teachers at the
line of scrimmage or set them back
for a loss time after time.
Using about two full teams alto
gether Coaches Cuddeback and Nov
el's were able to get a line on the
ability of their individual players
as well as of the team as a whole.
Judging from yesterday's scrim
mage the squad appears to be a good
deal stronger than at the beginning
of the season.
