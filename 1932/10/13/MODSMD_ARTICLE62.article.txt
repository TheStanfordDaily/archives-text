# STANFORD GRAYS DISPLAY VARSITY STYLE IN WORKOUT
## Squad Prepares Tor Game With Berkeley Greys; Scrimmages 
### 
Sixty football players, over a score
of them good enough to be first
stringers at any other college in the
country, are working out on the
Stanford Gray squad which is pre
paring for its season of two official
games, including one with the Cali
fornia Grays, and numerous in
formal scrimmages with other
schools.
Show Promise
Smith, Steiner, Buchanan, and
Norwood arc standouts at end, but
do not measure up with last year's
Gray wingmen: Packard and Grun
sky. Milt Keller, a star on the 1931
freshman squad, White, and Drown
are the best tackles.
Good Guards
There are numerous good guards:
Mottram, Tarver, and Gould will
some day be playing varsity ball,
while Semmelroth, Cooke, and Mor
gan are better-than-average play
ers.
The outstanding lineman on the
squad, Walt Muller, at center, makes
halt of the tackles for the Grays and
docs nine-tenths of the "pep-talk
ing"
Eddie Strong, fullback, is the best
back on the Gray squad. Some five
feet high, and nearly as broad,
Strong's showing against the Varsity
in scrimmages has been remarkable.
