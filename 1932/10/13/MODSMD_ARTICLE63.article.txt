ST. PAUL, Oct. 12 (JP)—A Min
nesota farm strike battle, in which
four persons were injured slightly,
was quelled today by deputy sher
ill's after an emissary had been sent
to ask the Governor for troops.
After his trip to the capitol, how
ever, the representative did not ask
for aid of national guardsmen as
deputies had regained control of the
small Howard Lake stockyards,
where pickets for higher farm pro
duce prices and their opponents
fought. The outbreak was the most
serious since farmers in several
Minnesota counties began picketing
highways and terminals several
weeks ago.
