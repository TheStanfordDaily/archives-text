# Claim Magnetic Poles Travel Elliptically
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 12 (/P) â€”A claim
of discovery of proof that the north
elliptical path around the North
magnetic pole travels in a great
Pole is announced today by Profes
sor T. J. J. See of the Naval Ob
servatory, Mare Island, Califoi-nia.
He says the south magnetic pole
travels a similar path, although in
the opposite direction, thereby ex
plaining errors in the mariner's com
pass all over the world. Professor
See's calculations disagree with re
cent findings of oiher scientists
concerning the cause of shifts of the
magnetic poles, called their "secu
lar variations."
