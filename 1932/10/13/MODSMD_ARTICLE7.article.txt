# Debye Sketches Symmetric Ion
## 
### 
With the idea that there is a defi
nite order in the ionic arrangement
of electrolytes, Dr. Peter Debye,
University of Leipzig scientist, yes
terday presented the third in his
series of campus lectures. The con
cluding lecture tomorrow will be
concerned with "Electric Despersion
and Polar Properties," and will be
held at 4:15 o'clock in Room 20 of
the Chemistry Building.
It was Dr. Dcbye's discovery that
there is an interrelation of electro
lyte ions just as there is a symmetry
in the molecule arrangement of
liquids. The Leipzig scientist main
tains that an orderly disorder exists
among the ions.
Dr. Debye stated: "If one were to
stand on a balcony and watch a
crowd in a ballroom after the dance,
he would first receive the impres
sion that all was confusion. But on
second examination he would dis
cover that by each woman was a
man, and that consequently some
order existed.
Thus it is with the solution of
ions. The ions are ordered together
as far as positive and negative par
ticles are concerned, but are dis
organized in general appearance.
