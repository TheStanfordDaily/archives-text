Meet At Encina
Freshmen are to meet in front of
Encina Hall at the same time to be
marked with green paint and will
then march to the field under the
leadership of Dean Kendall. Fresh
men are expected to wear some sort
of an upper while sophomores will
be stripped to the waist.
Charles Karl, Ray Wilbur, and
Ben Eastman, the committee in
charge of the fight, will be assisted
in the judging by other Encina spon
sors and the Scalpers, men's hon
orary organization. No men who are
out for football will be allowed to
participate.
Rules governing the contest, which
are printed in the student hand
book, are as follows:
"The field shall be roped off and
two enclosures shall be roped off
for those who have been thrown into
the pits.
"There shall be two pits, one at
each end of the field, which shall be
three feet deep and contain eighteen
inches of water.
"Participants must wear rubber
soled shoes or be barefooted, and
must not carry ropes or other
weapons.
"There shall be no slugging or un
necessary roughness.
"No man may re-enter the contest
after he has once been thrown into
a pit, but must remain in one of the
enclosures designated by the spon
sors for those who have been put
out of the fight.
"The duration of the fight shall
be thirty minutes, the beginning and
end of which shall be announced by
a pistol shot.
"The class which throws the most
of the opposing class into the pits
shall be judged the winner."
