# CARD RESERVE TEAM BATTLES SOLDIERS HERE
## Stanford Gridders Figured To Win; Pop Saving First Team ARMY ELEVEN STRONG Nodgie Ganuzzi, Presidio Star, Not Starting 
### Bob Letts 
The boys who have stayed in the
wigwam and watched the bigger
Stanford Indians wreak havoc with
four opponents this season get their
chance here tomorrow afternoon.
Their specific task will be to attempt
to convert the West Coast Army
mule into the well-known jackal.
Festivities start at 2:30 o'clock, with
a preliminary at noon between the
Stanford frosh seconds and San
Jose State College's yearlings. ■
With the reception for El Trojan
now only a week away, Pop War
ner is anxious to beat the Jarheads
using only reserves, but at the same
time he fears the possibility of hav
ing to subject his regulars to pos
sible injury in order to prevent a
trimming.
Originally scheduled as a "breath
er" to sharpen the Reds' condition
for October 22, tomorrow's clash has
taken a different aspect with the
rise in popularity of Lt. Johnny
Stokes' Presidio eleven. Victories
over Olympic Club, San Francisco
University, and Fresno State have
put the Jarheads in good shape after
dropping their opening game to the
Marines, 7-6.
Ganuzzi Missing
Gilbert and Glattly, two of the
four G's in the Army backfield, will
be in the starting lineup, according
to announcement. A third man, the
famous Nodgie ("Two-Yard") Gan
uzzi, who has led Presidio elevens
for the last seven years, will be on
the sidelines, if at the game at all.
Nodgie ,whose ability to add the
remaining yardage for a first down
or touchdown game him the nick
name, was sent to the Letterman
Hospital after last week's game
against S.F.U. He had fafled to re
spond as quickly as hoped to treat
ment for a bad cold. So Glattly, who
has come along nicely this year,
goes in at fullback, lt must break
Ganuzzi's heart after so many years
of gridiron warfare.
In seven years he withstood pun
ishment so well that time was never
called out for him—and he played
60 minutes of football in every
game.
The West Coast boys present an
other luminary this year who when
an Easterner thrilled Stanford foot
ball fans before. He is Lt. John
Price, bruising tackle, the same
Price that visited Palo Alto with
the famous Christian Keener ("Red")
Cagle and West Point's gridders in
1929.
Those who saw "Chuck" Smalling
and the Stanford team score a sen
sational victory over the Cadets
probably remember how Price's
work stood out in the Army line.
Once, when Smalling broke away
for an apparent touchdown, he was
hauled down from behind by Price,
who made up a five-yard handicap
and brought Smalling to earth after
a 50-yard run. ,
Because of an Army ruling that
no more than one commissioned of
ficer can play at the same time,
Price will not start, Lieutenant
Johnson being scheduled to line up
at the kickoff.
Warner's announced starters con
sist of the following: Packard and
Minckler, ends; Palamountain and
Holwcrda, tackles; Scribner and
Targhetta, guards; Blanchard, cen
ter; Allen, quarter; Van Dellen and
Afflerbaugh, halves, and Stevens,
fullback.
