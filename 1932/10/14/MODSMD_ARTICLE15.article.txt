# STAGG FORCED TO QUIT POST
## Warner Grieved At Loss Of Chicago Coach 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 13 (/P> â€” Amos
Alonzo Stagg, grand old man of
American football, was forced out as
director of athletics and head foot
ball coach at the University of Chi
cago tonight after forty years of ser
vice.
The order for Stagg's retirement
next June, coming as a stunning sur
prise to the intercollegiate athletic
world and to Stagg himself, was as
cribed to a rule providing that no
member of the faculty shall continue
to hold a post after reaching the age
of 70. Stagg became 70 Aug. 16.
Heart-Broken at News
Stagg, the dean of American foot
ball coaches, was heart-broken over
the action of the trustees, but ac
cepted it with the same spirit of
sportsmanship that characterized his
forty years of coaching record at
Chicago.
"According to my present feeling,
I expect to be good for 15 to 20 years
more of active service," Stagg said.
"I went into athletic work because
it offered the largest opportunity for
service through contact with young
men. No scheme of life, which re
moves that contact, would meet with
my ambition." ,
Warner Laments Loss
"The game is losing one of its best
known and most respected coaches,"
said Glenn Scobey Warner last night,
when informed by the Stanford Daily
of the dismissal of Amos Alonzo
Stagg.
"He was the grand old man of
American football, always represent
ing the game at its best, and always
turning out teams against which il
was a pleasure to play," Pop added.
Warner only met Stagg once on
the football field, when Chicago was
champion of the western conference,
and at that time his Haskell Indians
beat the Maroons 18-4.
