# Quad Calls I-N Seniors Today
## 
### 
Seniors whose names run from I
to N will have their pictures taken
for the 1933 Quad today. They are
reminded that the studio is located
at 520 Salvatierra, across from Ma
drono Hall, and not in the Press
annex as it was last year. A great
many persons have been misdirected
to the latter place.
D to H seniors who did not appear
for pictures as scheduled yesterday
may still be photographed today,
Ray Hanson, Quad editor, announced
last night.
All students interested in photo
graphy, a major part of the Quad
work, are asked to meet George
Waters, head photographer, at 7:15
o'clock Monday evening in the
Quad office.
