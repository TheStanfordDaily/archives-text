# FROSH WALLOP CLASS OF '35 IN MUD FIGHT
## Two Men Are Injured As First-Year Men Get Surprise Verdict 
### David Mellinkoff 
Last night as meek cries of "To
hell with '36" continued to sound
forth from sophomore halls, four
hundred and fifty happy Encinamen
shouted back lustily "'35 has gone to
hell"!
For the "frosh" had just stampeded
through accepted tradition and soph
omore battle lines in delivering the
first decisive and official defeat to
upperclassmen in a decade!
Ten Injured
When the mud of battle had
washed away, Walter Coursen, '35,
with a fractured collar bone, and Ed
gar Gibb, '36 with torn knee liga
ments led a list of ten injured. Two
wrenched sophomore backs, a scat
tering of twisted arms, torn toe nails
and general physical and mental dis
orders completed the catastrophe.
But the game was worth the
groans! Such a grand spectacle of
mud, water, and "nature in the raw"
the campus has never seen!
The battle royal started with a
gun shot and shrieks, and continued
with shrieks! Both teams started out
timidly and watchfully. A sudden
flanking movement by the sophs was
met with "To Hell" and mass frosh
action. Five frosh met one soph, and
one soph was gargling mud-water.
Clothes Pulling Results
What the sophs lacked in numbers,
they tried to make up for by experi
ence. Every frosh green-shirt was
the target for Branner Beef. They
twisted, slithered, and slobbered
(slobbering was not banned). The
first sophomore tide rippled in the
mud hole. But the magnetic attrac
tion of oozy liquid earth doomed the
happy frosh.
The second episode of the fight de
generated into a clothes-pulling bee.
The jeans of Soph Captain Aylett
Cotton were rapidly peeled away. A
scattering of shoes, socks, rags, shirts,
and personal adornments were then
snatched up by souvenir hunters.
The crowd was receiving its money's
worth!
Fight Photographed
Newsreel men pushed through the
mob. Giant sophs and ferocious frosh
tossed half-nelsons and more primi
tive grasps into the eye of the cam
era.
No one saw the timer raise his
gun! Everyone heard the shot which
ended the slaughter. There was si
multaneous cheering by '36 and '35.
But Ben Eastman, Charlie Karl and
Ray Wilbur announced the frosh vic
tory.
Culver Gives Official Sanction
The field soon cleared. One fresh
man continued to stand in the soph
mud hole. An understanding brother
threw him a pair of gym pants. He
came running out,!
Dean of Men George Culver an
nounced last night that the mud fight
had official approval. He stressed the
fact that the costly and disastrous
"night raid" had been eliminated,
and that the injured were less num
erous than the usual football cas
ualties. The mud fight will con
tinue!

Last night as meek cries of "To
hell with '36" continued to sound
forth from sophomore halls, four
hundred and fifty happy Encinamen
shouted back lustily "'35 has gone to
hell"!
For the "frosh" had just stampeded
through accepted tradition and soph
omore battle lines in delivering the
first decisive and official defeat to
upperclassmen in a decade!
Ten Injured
When the mud of battle had
washed away, Walter Coursen, '35,
with a fractured collar bone, and Ed
gar Gibb, '36 with torn knee liga
ments led a list of ten injured. Two
wrenched sophomore backs, a scat
tering of twisted arms, torn toe nails
and general physical and mental dis
orders completed the catastrophe.
But the game was worth the
groans! Such a grand spectacle of
mud, water, and "nature in the raw"
the campus has never seen!
The battle royal started with a
gun shot and shrieks, and continued
with shrieks! Both teams started out
timidly and watchfully. A sudden
flanking movement by the sophs was
met with "To Hell" and mass frosh
action. Five frosh met one soph, and
one soph was gargling mud-water.
Clothes Pulling Results
What the sophs lacked in numbers,
they tried to make up for by experi
ence. Every frosh green-shirt was
the target for Branner Beef. They
twisted, slithered, and slobbered
(slobbering was not banned). The
first sophomore tide rippled in the
mud hole. But the magnetic attrac
tion of oozy liquid earth doomed the
happy frosh.
The second episode of the fight de
generated into a clothes-pulling bee.
The jeans of Soph Captain Aylett
Cotton were rapidly peeled away. A
scattering of shoes, socks, rags, shirts,
and personal adornments were then
snatched up by souvenir hunters.
The crowd was receiving its money's
worth!
Fight Photographed
Newsreel men pushed through the
mob. Giant sophs and ferocious frosh
tossed half-nelsons and more primi
tive grasps into the eye of the cam
era.
No one saw the timer raise his
gun! Everyone heard the shot which
ended the slaughter. There was si
multaneous cheering by '36 and '35.
But Ben Eastman, Charlie Karl and
Ray Wilbur announced the frosh vic
tory.
Culver Gives Official Sanction
The field soon cleared. One fresh
man continued to stand in the soph
mud hole. An understanding brother
threw him a pair of gym pants. He
came running out,!
Dean of Men George Culver an
nounced last night that the mud fight
had official approval. He stressed the
fact that the costly and disastrous
"night raid" had been eliminated,
and that the injured were less num
erous than the usual football cas
ualties. The mud fight will con
tinue!
