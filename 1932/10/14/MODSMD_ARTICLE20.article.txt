# Unusual Stunts Planned for S.C. Game and Rally
## Rooters' Caps Required For Game Tomorrow 
### 
All men who sit in the Stanford
rooting section tomorrow must wear
regulation red and white rooers' hats,
it was ruled by the Rally Committee
at its meeting last night.
They cannot be purchased at the
stadium, it was revealed, but are sold
only at Roos Bros, at $1.00 each.
Rooters are asked to learn the In
dian songs and yells before the game.
All new students will find the words
to these in the freshman "bibles" is
sued to them last week.
Promising the most novel and sen
sational rally in recent years, Chair
man Bob Churchill stated a gigantic
rally - jollyup - get-together for the
Southern California game with lots
of free cigarettes and entertainment
thrown in will be held Wednesday
night at 7:15 in the Pavilion.
Plenty of unusual and startling
ideas are being planned and will be
announced in Monday's Daily, ac
cording to the committee. Rooting
section ideas for stunts are now being
accepted from any students who will
outline their plan and submit it in
writing to Bob Chui'chill at 592 Al
varado. These ai'e to be designed
either for the Southern Cal contest
or the Big Game.
Rooters are requested to follow
the instructions of the yell leaders
as well as possible at all times, in
order that a maximum support can
be given the varsity during the game
tomorrow.
