## 
### 
Finally getting together in spite
of conflicts with other meetings of
the freshman class, the freshmen
interested in debating met with Vir
gil Anderson, freshman debating
coach, to decide the question and
time for tryouts.
Tryouts for the freshman squad
will be held on Thursday, October
20, at 4:15 and 7:30 o'clock in Room
214 of the English Building. The
different hours were selected in
order that all interested may have
a chance to try out. Speeches are
to be extemporaneous, five minutes
in length, on the subject, "Resolved,
that modern advertising is more
detrimental than beneficial."
