# Julian Huxley Predicts Biological Achievements
## 
### Albert Guerard 
''Scienco is progressing steadily. |
We can do many funny things with 1
animals; develop them to maturity |
when, they should still be infants, j
We can reasonably expect that there j
will be biological achievements in j
fifty years which would appear as- !
tonishing to us now."
These were the encouraging words
of Julian Sorell Huxley before his
final lecture of the West Memorial
series yesterday. Professor Huxley
has keen, piercing eyes and a man
ner of walking that attracts the af
fection of animals. He follows nei- l
ther the pattern of the academic J
scientist or the highly emotional
poet.
Speaking of Russia, Professor
Huxley declared that decided opin
ions on the success or failure of i
the U.S.S.P. at the present time are j

| as unfair as "final" judgments con-
I cerning the State of California made
jin 1855. Russia's economic condi-
I tion, which has required her to dis
' miss many of the American experts
i she had engaged, is deplorable, ac
i cording to Professor Huxley. But
! recent discoveries in synthetic rub
[ ber will be extremely helpful to
Russia, for rubber has been one of
the principal raw materials which
| she has lacked in the past ....
Professor Huxley interrupted
himself to remark on the beauty of
a California bluejay poised deli
cately on the very edge of a nefirby
1 fountain.
The biologist's eyes were alight,
j The bird flew out of sight and into
a tree near the fountain, but Pro
| fessor Huxley's eyes still looked in
| tently at the spot where the bird
i had been perched a moment before.
