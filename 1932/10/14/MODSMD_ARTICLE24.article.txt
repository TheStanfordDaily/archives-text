# Sixteen Maimed In Human Slide Down Aqueduct
## Avalanche Starts When Men Slip On Wet Section Of Los Angeles Water Tube In Grapevine Canyon; Blame Lack Of Proper Safety Ropes 
### 
JOS ANGELES, Oct. 13. (/P) —In inky blackness a human avalanche
1 plunged down a steeply inclined steel tube segment of the Los Angeles
aqueduct 150 miles north of here early today and sixteen workmen were
injured, some seriously. Nine feet in diameter, the tube is a siphon in
the aqueduct at Grapevine canyon—a wild and lonely spot.
The men were strung out down the first hundred feet on the 900-foot
slope, chipping and scraping the interior of the python-like siphon. A
man at the top slipped and fell, lie struck the next man below, the light

♦ went out, and the avalanche started.
I Sharp tools mixed in with the
j shouting, struggling mass of men
! as they slid to the bottom. Some of
J the men plunged several hundred
feet.
Fellow workmen who had not en-
I tered the tube went to the rescue,
j Ten ambulances and a medical
! squad called from here brought the
victims to Los Angeles hospitals this
j morning.
Wet Tube Slippery
The accident occurred about 10
j minutes after midnight, just after a
I new shift of workmen had come on.
! Water had been shut off and
1 drained from the siphon last night
! and the bottom of the tube was
I still slippery enough to make a
i veritable chute for the workmen,
| once they were dislodged from their
! positions.
Two of the men said after reach
| ing here that there were no safety
| ropes in the tube, but officials of
; the water bureau, including W. W.
j Hurlbu'r, engineer in charge of
! water works, said they were certain
! such ropes must have been in place.
Tell Terror Scenes
Victims told of scenes of terror.
; Some of the men thought they were
I plunging to their deaths.
Harry F. Quinn, one of the first
\ to reach here, said:
"We were all high up in the si
| phon. We had no safety belts and
j no ropes, and we were working at
| a sharp angle.
"Suddenly the top man slipped
: and started to slide. He cried out
j and came down, carrying us all to
! the bottom with him."

JOS ANGELES, Oct. 13. (/P) —In inky blackness a human avalanche
1 plunged down a steeply inclined steel tube segment of the Los Angeles
aqueduct 150 miles north of here early today and sixteen workmen were
injured, some seriously. Nine feet in diameter, the tube is a siphon in
the aqueduct at Grapevine canyon—a wild and lonely spot.
The men were strung out down the first hundred feet on the 900-foot
slope, chipping and scraping the interior of the python-like siphon. A
man at the top slipped and fell, lie struck the next man below, the light

♦ went out, and the avalanche started.
I Sharp tools mixed in with the
j shouting, struggling mass of men
! as they slid to the bottom. Some of
J the men plunged several hundred
feet.
Fellow workmen who had not en-
I tered the tube went to the rescue,
j Ten ambulances and a medical
! squad called from here brought the
victims to Los Angeles hospitals this
j morning.
Wet Tube Slippery
The accident occurred about 10
j minutes after midnight, just after a
I new shift of workmen had come on.
! Water had been shut off and
1 drained from the siphon last night
! and the bottom of the tube was
I still slippery enough to make a
i veritable chute for the workmen,
| once they were dislodged from their
! positions.
Two of the men said after reach
| ing here that there were no safety
| ropes in the tube, but officials of
; the water bureau, including W. W.
j Hurlbu'r, engineer in charge of
! water works, said they were certain
! such ropes must have been in place.
