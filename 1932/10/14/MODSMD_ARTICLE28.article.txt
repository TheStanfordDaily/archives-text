# AT LAST, THEY LEAD
## 
### 
Thai the interfraternily Hoard of (Control lias al lasl
definitely assumed its rightful place as leader instead of
police for fraternities was indicated in a meeting of that
body this week.
For, though it passed no oflicial legislation, it definitely
went on record as unanimously favoring the idea of fixing
;i standard penally for any house proven guilty of violating
the new rushing rules. The penalty they deemed proper
would deprive an offending fraternity of the rushing privi
lege for a solid year, and the freshman of the pledging
privilege for the same period of time.
I nder the old rules, such legislation would have heen
utterly unthinkable. Illegal rushing was necessary in order
that fraternities and freshmen could make any sort of satis
factory contact, while it was essential for the Hoard to act
in the police capacity to prevent all parties from running
amuck.
I'lidcr those conditions the Hoard could not lead; it
could not enforce its rules; it could not even indicate be
forehand the exact nature of the penalty that would he
meted out for violation.
There was something incongruous in the setup of having
rules, admitting that they had to be broken, and then slap
ping occasional penalties 011 houses that broke them.
Whether or not the new rules still hold too much regu
lation is open for debate. Hut it is certain that thev are suf
ficiently workable to deserve a try. And the only way to
give them a fair test is to enforce them.
Undoubtedly the Hoard will, at its very next meeting,
follow out the sensible policy it has indicated bv officially
passing the one year penalty rule.
