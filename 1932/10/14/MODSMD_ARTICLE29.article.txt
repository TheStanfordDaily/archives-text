# IS IT NECESSARY?
## 
### 
After watching the mud fiiÂ» 111 for the past two years, the
Dmi.y feels that there is no longer a need for the freshman-;
sophomore clash. Whether it is a good thing or not, the fact
remains that the intense feeling among the various classes'
is a thing of the past. Whatever spirit exists is purely syn
thetic the creation of upper classmen who en joy watching
a good tight.
Only three years ago the "traditional" battle was in fair
way of (lying out from purely natural causes. The first year
men through the influence of "bible" and a little concen
trated ballyhoo have been led to believe that the IHiversity
would forever place a stigma on their name if they failed
to participate. It was very noticeable that the proportion
of sophomores on the held was small as compared to that
of the freshman.
The crowd that witnessed yesterday's fray gave a fair
indication of the interest the struggle had for the college in
general. Inhabitants of Palo Alto made up two-thirds of
the spectators!
If these meetings are doing no good and are not filling
any great need the injuries which result seem doubly sense
less. Last year six serious mishaps were recorded at the
Student's 1 Icalth Service, and this year, besides many minor
hurts, four men will he laid up for a month or more with
damages ranging from a broken collar bone to torn toe
nails! At least the Palo Alto audience should feel satisfied.'
