# HUXLEY CLOSES WEST LECTURES
## Duties of Science, "Escape" Discussed By Biologist 
### 
One of the next duties of science
is to study society, for though sci- j
ence has advanced fairly far in the ,
study of single functions such as ]
marriage and love, it has neglected
the general aspect of social life.
This was one of the principal !
points advanced last night by Julian I
S. Huxley in the last of his "Biology i
and Human Nature" lectures on the
West Memorial Foundation.
Of even greater interest to the
audience, however, was Professor j
Huxley's treatment of "escape":
"We can rise above our practical j
life through imagination, rational j
understanding, and aspiration." The
right kind of escape is that which
is enjoyed for itself alone. Accept- j
ing the universe means getting down
to brass tacksâ€”and the best method i
is the scientific method.
As he had classified man's three I
attitudes toward "conflict" in the
lecture on "The Uniqueness of (
Man," Professor Huxley classified
the three stages of society as the
child-like, the emergence of the in- i
dividual, and the attainment of
solidarity.
Before published in book form as j
stipulated by the West Memorial
Foundation, Professor Huxley's |
three lectures will be lengthened j
and elaborated.
