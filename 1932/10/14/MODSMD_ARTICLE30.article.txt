Cap and down got I lit* depression dance idea first this j
year, scheduling their party for tomorrow night in the
Women's dym, and it's a great idea. Depression dancesj
are always good ideas. They always have been good ideas.
But, when you get right down to considering the dances!
themselves, they're still just good ideas.
Depression dance committees never seem to care very
much whether their guests, customers, or suckers (however
you look at it) have a good time. The committees hire the
best music they can afford, sprinkle spangles on the tloor,
and lower the gates, shouting "dome one, come all. A lot
of fun for a little dough."
And, believe you your own eyes, brother, if you've ever
attended a depression dance, they all come. Not that you
can be sure they're all there, for most of the crowd is
strange, but it's unquestionably the Stanford man's best
single opportunity to get acquainted with the socially elite
members of pre)) schooldom from one end of the Peninsula
to the other.
The Daily cried itself hoarse last year for depression j
dances which will be for Stanford students only, with stu
dent body cards as necessary for admittance as two-bit j
pieces, lint dap and down, unheeding, has already ex
tended a blanket invitation, and oh, well the slightly
younger generation will probably have a good lime.
