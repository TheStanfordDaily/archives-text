# BULL SESSION
## THE 						GRAD IN THE ELEVATOR 
### 
Bouncing into an elevator the
other day, I recognized the operator, '
driver, or whatever they call the
guy that makes it go, to be an old I
college acquaintance. I started to ;
say hello and begin the usual chat
ter of, "How have you been?"— j
"What's doing?"—etc.; when I was
fairly thrown across the lift and
psychically cracked the opposite
wall with a horrific thud. The pro- '
pelling force was the synthetic i
frigid stare of his forced ignorance. :
I was dumfounded for a few j
moments; but then the rising color j
in the fellow's cheeks and the visi
ble tightening of his jaw muscles
j told the story. At my floor, I barged
1 out with just as much pseudo un- I
' acquaintance as he had at first mus- '
tered. We both were trying to put
up a front—and each knew that the
other had failed.
. !
He was ashamed—terribly ashamed i
—that four years in the ethereal j
| realms of higher education had only j
j netted him a captaintcy of a local j
elevator. He thought that people j
would laugh because after learning j
the theories of Plato—the mysteries ;
j of hydraulics—and the reputed j
! glories of Shakespeare, he would be
f forced to go up and down, day in
and day out, without getting any- !
where. He felt the "bird" that his ■
i former cronies were apt to give him j
l every time they stepped into that
j elevator.
Going to university in the days j
before everybody knew that "Pros- >
, perity-around-the-corner" was just ;
a big horse-laugh, he had acquired
the prevalent collegiate notion that j

all grads just naturally fitted into !
] the higher income tax brackets. '
Frog-skins were said to follow '
i sheep-skins with unfailing persist- j
ency. And with the illusion built
! up that executives were trembling 1
behind their mahogany desks every j
time the colleges disgorged an- !
other batch of graduates, the colle- j
gian went forth to conquer.
When only the cream of the crop
i came to college, it was natural that
i the graduates should easily storm i
the financial heights. But when the
j skimmed milk started tracking in— '
j and when still later even the chalk- |
water flooded the campi, the same i
reasoning prevailed about the "big |
, money." That was unfortunate; and :
' when followed by an equally un
fortunate circumstance, the depres-
I sion, the collegians found that em
-1 ployers were not lined up at the i
i college gates salaaming all gradu- 1
i ates in a mad endeavor to get them '
j at any price.
College has its advantages—but \
| not necessarily financial in nature, j
i When that is realized, there may be j
; less people at college; but the loss '
I to educational ideals will probably !
not send culture catapulting to j
oblivion. It's tough to live for four i
| years something like a gentleman j
| with the expectation of a lif" of !
| opulence, ease, and position in the
! future—and then end up pushing a !
! lever in an elevatoi'.
! But it's the necessary consequence i
j of a society where everyone wants i
I to wear white collars and scoff at
; everybody else who has to wear
| blue denim. —Abe Mellinkoff
