GKANI) HOTEL (Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer)—At (he Stanford Theatre.
Probably every nation has its
share of melodramas which, worth
less and banal, nevertheless rise to
tremendous public favor and are
variously billed as great and good.
But in this matter of accepting
trash as eminently fine the United
States seems to have taken a con
siderable lead.
The outstanding modern example
of the triumph of gunplay and sen
timent over intelligent emotion is
the success of Grand Hotel. Metro 1 *
wisely stuffed the cast with celebri
ties and made of it a remarkable
and worthy picture.
The cast is fine and the settings
and photography, while not spec
tacular, satisfactory. Lionel Barry
more makes a more endurable
Kringlein—against that role's horrid
difficulties—than did whining Chris
tian Rub; but it is not difficult to
see meanwhile that the Barrymore
humor is looking at the part ob
jectively.
The picture drops after the mur
der of von Gaigern and thereafter
falls except in the last shots of
Garbo and the final scene with
Barrymore and Crawford. It is a
picture eminently worth seeing
because of its cast, which happily
makes no attempt to monopolize j
audience interest as individual stars.

This picture gets off to a very
| bad start when a policeman comes
j to take away Frau Vogel's pet dog;
Frau Vogel sheds tears and laments
i in a manner not at all conducive
to laughter. But when the confisca
tion of the dog upsets a small-town
I political campaign and breaks up |
two happy homes the film suddenly !
! becomes comedy of a very high j
order—in fact, the best comedy I i
J have seen for a long time.
And it is comedy rising from !
i situation and character, not from j
i trick direction or fancy dialogue; I
result is that the story, although j
it descends almost to farce, still has >
a convincing quality.
Hansi Niese as the old flower lady I
was the one outstanding member of
a uniformly good cast. Her comedy
is very much like that of Marie ,
I Dressier, but (except in the opening !
| sequence) she avoids the sentimen- j
! tality which mars that comedienne's j
pictures. The comic effect she pro
j duces is merely that of an uncul- ;
I tured woman whose affairs are sud- I
! denly mixed with those of high so
ciety.
I The play from which the film was
' taken (Storm in a Waterglass) was
successful in Germany but failed i
with American audiences. And there
is a possibility that the film will do j
the same, since the type of comedy j
. with which it deals has been rare j
in American pictures.
j Too, it suffers from a lack of Eng
lish titles and the brief synopsis is j
| probably not sufficient to make it j
i intelligible to those not acquainted 1
, with the German language.—C.A.Z. j
