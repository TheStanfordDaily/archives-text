i The market turned downward
again yesterday. The decline was
| limited in most issues to Va-3 points.
; Volume was 1.200,000 shares. New
York Stock Exchange interest rates
I on call loans went to 1%, lowest in
1 more than a year. Woolworth voted
the regular dividend. Foreign bonds
were strong, first grade domestics
steady and second grade issues ac
tive but closed soft. Cotton was
lower. Socony-Vacuum announced
schedule of five-day week, with
proportionate decrease in pay. Iron
Age estimated week's Ignot produc
tion at 19% capacity, up 11,/2%l 1 , / 2% from
September.
The market promises to be choppy
until after election. Possibilities of
dubious financial effects from Roose
velt's policies, if elected, are obvi
ously being discounted by prevail
ing easier tone in stock quotations.
From personal observations the
writer is assured Wall Street and
its representatives are practically
unanimously behind Hoover. This
fact is part of the Democratic cam
paign sales talk, designated and
usually successful toward influenc
ing those voters who have been bit
ten by the financial markets or who
envy the power, prestige, and lux
ury associated with Big Business.
Too often the worker forgets that
industry at the top must be profit
able in order to maintain operations
and pay.
Odds on the election are current
ly quoted at 10-7 to 2-1, favoring
Roosevelt. However, the force and
quality of Hoover's last speech is
beginning to net results for the Re
publican ranks. Hoover is definitely
dedicated to those policies which
shall insure retention of the gold
standard, continuation of the pres
ent protective tariff, and assure the
workers of jobs by insuring the
stability of large industries with
loans advanced through the R.F.C.
Wall Street is curious as to
Roosevelt's actual attitude in regard
to the Bonus, Loans of R.F.C. to
financially embarrassed corpora
tions, and the tariff. Wall Street
does NOT fear any regulation or
control, suggested in certain cam
paign promises, any more than it
does an earthquake.
