# Karl Sees Economies In New A.S.S.U. Offices
## 
### 
Completion of the new A.S.S.U.
offices in the Old Union yesterday
marks ihe latest step toward the
realization of a Student Union in
practice as well as in name, and
constitutes a major economy in the
Associated Student budget for the
coming year, according to Charles
Karl, student manager.
Economy will result, Karl said,
from the fact that co-operation be
tween groups under the Student
Organization Fund control and the
student manager will be increased.
Karl will also be able to supervise
the organizations with greater effi
ciency.
