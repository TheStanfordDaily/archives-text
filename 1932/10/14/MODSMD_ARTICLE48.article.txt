NOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN
OUT to watch the water polo team
practicing under the watchful eye
of Coach Nort Thornton, no one can
tell us that the Olympics went lor
nothing. Thornton watched the
Hungarian water polo champions
play until he mastered the tech
nique of these human fish com
pletely. Now he is showing the Farm
splashers how to do it.
.1 i m mie II all o's "Golden
Weenie" is going to he in lor
the time of its life when the
Washington State juggernaut
gets going out on the lurl of
Memorial Stadium tiiis Satur
day.
All this stuff about, "my team is
going to win"' doesn't mean much
unless there is something behind it.
Ingrim, as nearly as we can figure
out, must have a regular depart
ment for his weekly psychology and
publicity campaigns. So far he has
tailed them pretty well, hut. he has
bitten off an awfully big piece for
this mouthful.
Ilollinghcrry has the best
triple-threat man on the coast
(his year in George Sander. Last
year he passed twenty-four
times for l!* 0 yards, and this
year he is even better. They say
he can kick out of bounds on
the five- and ten-yard lines
from his own side of the fifty
yard stripe with amazing regu
larity.
Then there is that truck at the
fullback position, the 240-pound Mr.
Theodoratus. As if it weren't bad
enough to weigh that much, the
young man can move his bulk
around the landscape at an alarm
ing rate of speed.
Washington Slate still has a score
1o settle from last year, and it looks
as if they might do it soon. Cali
fornia can't win all its games on the
old alma mater spirit.
STANFORD'S FROSII LEAVE
TONIGHT for their first big
game of the year. They have
three of these big battlesâ€”
U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and the Bear
Cubs.
If past form means anything, the
Indian yearlings should win handily.
They showed last Saturday that
they could battle tough opposition
to a standstill, and then go out and
score enough to put the game on
ice.
Taken individually, and as a team,
they are a sweet bunch of ball
players, and if they remember that
they are up against a lot of boys
who are big, but who have nowhere
near the Stanford power, they ought
to win, after a mighty hard fight.

ONH OF THE BIG CITY
scribes has decided (hat Pop
must be scared slid of the Army
because he is staying here in
stead of watching the Trojans
whip Loyola.
