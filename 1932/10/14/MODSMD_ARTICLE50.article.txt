Bruins Ready
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13.â€”At- ,
tempting to score two wins in as |
many years, the University of Cali- j
fornia at Los Angeles freshman grid
ders combat the Stanford first year |
men Saturday afternoon on the i
Westwood field.
Bruins Tie L.A.J.C.
Schedule difficulties prevented the i
U.C.L.A. aggregation from playing j
more than one game, a scoreless tie |
with Los Angeles Junior College. In I
their one performance the Cubs I
showed excellent potential power,
and only lack of team-work pre
vented them from scoring on sev
eral occasions. Coach Cliff Simpson
believes that he has a better team
than the one which upset Stanford
13 to 8 last year.
