A groggy figure, the shadow of one of the greatest lightweights of
all time, sagged helplessly into the arms of the referee and Benny
Leonard was at the end of the comeback trailâ€”victim of the youthful
punching of Jimmy McLarnin. Referee Arthur Donovan stopped the
fight in the sixth round of their New York engagement and awarded
the verdict to McLarnin on a technical knockout. (Associated Press
