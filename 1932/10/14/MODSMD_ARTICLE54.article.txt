# Pett Defeated In Golf, 2 Up
## Ernie McCormick Cards 78 To Make Ninth Rung 
### 
Shooting extremely good golf and
turning in a score of 78 for the round,
Ernest McCormick defeated Stew
Pett for the ninth rung position on
the varsity golf leader.
Final score was 2 up, Pett turning
in an 80 for the eighteen holes. Mc-
Cormick's score of 78 bids fair to
trouble some of those whose names
rank ahead of him on the varsity
scale at present.
Pett's play was not so brilliant, al
though he did shoot a steady game
of golf.
Chuck Teague and Ralph Allen,
playing as a team for Phi Delta Phi
in the intramural tournament, played
their qualifying round yesterday aft
ernoon. They were the first of the
intramural teams to shoot their ini
tial eighteen holes.

Because he didn't like potato soup
and walked out on the family din
ner,, a Denver man was recently
sent to jail by his wife.
