# Neophytes Learn News Writing From Editors
## 
### 
Tryoutees for the Daily staff held
one of their semi-weekly meetings
last night. The candidates were sep
arated into several groups each un
der (he direction of one of the news
paper editors. They were given as
signments and taught some of the
fundamentals of writing.
More tryoutees signed up for the
paper and if there are still any wish
ing to try out, they may sign at the
Daily office, although the wealth of
material will make competition for
reporting positions severe.
