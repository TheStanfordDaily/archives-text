# VANDERBILT ELEVEN RATED OVER TULANE IN SOUTHERN CONFERENCE GRID CLASSIC
## 
### Albert Gerard 
Vanderbilt University, one of the |
South's great teams last year, broke j
down on the rocks of poor passing !
and inexperienced punting in the
last few games of the season.
This fall the Commodores have a ]
fast set of backs, and one of the i
heaviest and most experienced lines 1
in the country. Coach Dan McGugin j
is one of the most feared coaches in j
the South, although his 1931 eleven .
lost four games; to Tulane, Georgia, |
Tennessee, and Alabama. The Tu- 1
lane-Vanderbilt game this weekend i
should have a large bearing on the I
Southern Conference and mythical j
national championship honors. Both j
teams have had little trouble in their
early season games, Tulane being im- j
pressive in victories over Texas Ag
gies and Georgia.

| Vanderbilt has coasted through her j
i first three opponents, facing only j
i second class teams, so the Commo- !
i dores will be much fresher for the {
| "Buttle of New Orleans" Saturday |
j afternoon.
If Vanderbilt is ever to have a title j
j winning team it must be this year, j
j for nine of her eleven first stringers j
I are seniors, so the 1933 team will j
I probably be weak. Early season!
I practices at Nashville have empha- '
i sized passing and punting, for the
Commodores' running attack is al
ready one of the most powerful in
the country.
At New Orleans Tulane is a 10-7 ]
favorite, at Nashville Vanderbilt is j
picked by similar odds. In San Fran
cisco no one is betting on the game,
.the Daily's New York correspondent |
j has not yet forwarded any last min- |
ute instructions, so . . . . ?
