# REARS ARE MADE FAVORITES OVER W. S. C. GRIDDERS
## Hank Schaldach To Play Part Of Conference Tilt Tomorrow 
### Dick Rodda 
The Pacific Coast's hardest fighting
football eleven, the California Gol
i den Bears, will take the field tomor
i row afternoon at the Berkeley Me
j morial Stadium against the formid
| able Washington State Cougars for
j the first conference game of the sea-
I son.
Because the Bears fought their
way to a tie over the highly touted
St. Mary's Gaels last Saturday, they
i have once again been elevated to the
' favorite class and will probably be
! given an edge over the Cougars on
th# eve of the battle. The fact that.
Hard Luck Hank Schaldacb will
once again be in the Bear lineup,
although he reinjured his ankle in
practice, will stimulate the Bears
even more.
Schaldach will not play the whole
game; in fact, he won't even be in
the opening lineup, but Bill Ingram
promises to use him as much as pos
sible.
I Washington State boasts a 240-
pound hard hitting fullback in Ihe
j person of George Theodoratus as its
I chief threat. The Greek backlield
' ace has done considerable damage
j to Cougar opponents so far this sea
| son and in one game he averaged
j about eight yards each for a half
dozen line plunges in success on.
i Should Theodoratus find a weak spot
j in the Bear line, the Cougars may
1 go places themselves tomorrow aft
!ernoon.
"Babe" Hollingbery, Washington
i Slate mentor, and Bill Ingram of the
j Bears are each confident that his
! team will win. The Cougars are out
i to even things up for themselves in
i conference competition, having lost
j their initial tilt to U.S.C.
