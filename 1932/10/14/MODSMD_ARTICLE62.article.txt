### Bob Jones 
With three touch football games
scheduled for 4 o'clock Monday af
ternoon, the autumn intramural .sea
son officially moves under way the
first of next week.
Alpha Kappa Lambda will meet
the clubmen from El Tigre on the
varsity baseball diamond field, while
the Chi Psi's will tangle with the
El Cuadro squad, and Sequoia II
will play Sigma Chi on the frosh
ball field. With each team starting
from scratch as far as squad achieve
ments are concerned, the field of 37
contestants will dominate the fall
mural horizon until the time of
finals.
Playing on 100-yard fields, the
teams of seven men, with six as a
minimum, will follow the regular
football rules with few exceptions.
No player may use spiked or cleated
shoes. Golf shoes come under this
listing of prohibited footwear and
are therefore taboo for game play.
The first round of mural play is
