# Future Bright In Water Polo
## 
### 
Although Captain Buike Knapp is
temporarily "out" with a cracked
! rib, Stanford's varsity water polo
I team is showing plenty of potential
power in scrimmages.
Knapp was injured last week
when he was kicked during practice
and will be on the sidelines for the
1 next week or two. However, as the
j scheduled meets will not start until
. winter quarter, he will be back in
j plenty of time to defend Stanford's
goal.
j In the absence of Knapp, Leo Cook
j has been doing some excellent work
i in the goalie position.
Coach Nort Thornton has been em-
I ploying a new type of offense simi
; lar to that introduced by the Hun
! garian team which won the Olympic
j Games championship. It consists of
I a fast-breaking offense which is ideal
| for the Indian team in that almost
every man is an exceptionally fast
; swimmer.
Hitherto, American teams have
been content to play a waiting game
I along more defensive lines.
