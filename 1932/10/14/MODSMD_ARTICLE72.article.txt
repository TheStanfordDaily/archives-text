# Army Pointed For Pitt Game
## 
### 
WEST POINT, N.Y., Oct. 13 (/P)â€”
Grimly determined to make Major
Ralph Sasse's last year as coach at
West Point a winning one, a fight
ing Army football team today com
pleted its final heavy practice for its
first major engagement of the year
against Pittsburgh Saturday.
When the Major announced last
night that he was leaving the Point,
another hurdle was expected in front
of Pittsburgh.
Many of the members of the Army
varsity this year are first class men,
playing their last year at the Point;
Sasse has been their coach during
their full varsity career; they took
an unexpected 26-0 licking from
Pittsburgh last year. Add up i>ll
those factors and Army men will
assert the final result is "victory."
