# Soccer Squad Prepares For San Mateo J.C.
## 
### 
With one scalp already in their
; possession, the Indian soccermen are
: doing a new war dance today as they
prepare for ihe Irek up the peninsula
j tomorrow morning where they will
j go on the warpath against the San
j Mateo Junior College eleven.
Big Chief Harry Maloney shuffled
| his braves around just a bit at yes
terday's scrimmage, the changes
! coming as a result of the perform
; ance down at San Jose Wednesday
j when the men from the Farm almost
missed their scalping duties and
j barely eked out a 2 to 1 victory.
Erwin Brekelbaum, who played
i goalie against the Teachers, may re
vert to his original fullback position
j in tomorrow's skirmish. At any rate,
' two other goalies, Jack King and
j Milt Newman, arc being taken along
]on the trip. The other change ef
j fected yesterday was the conversion
| of Gas Rojas from an inside forward
! to a wingman and he may share
| time with Even Douington, the regu-
I lar outside.
The rest of the squad will remain
I practically the same as in the first
I game. Hearn, Johnson, and Velarde
j will comprise the center combina
i lion, with Carl Knecht playing left
j wing. White, Spohr, and Kennedy
| will be the starting halves, and in
; al! likelihood, Branch and Washburn
j will open the game at fullback with
I Brekelbaum in the goal.
