# Kings, Queens, Princes Among Stanford Alumni
## 
### Rolph Malloch 
No Lady has ever graduated from
Stanford!
Proof of this lies in the official
Alumni Directory, whjch also shows
that no Duke was ever educated
here, although five Earls have graced
the campus.
A piece of heavy research has
' brought forth the important knowl
j edge that alumni list includes 71
Kings, three Queens, six Princes and
eight Lords.
One graduate is named Early, and
another Later. Punners will rejoice
i to hear that a former Stanfordite
named Story is working as teller in
a bank.
The directory also lists seven
Fowles, eight Birds, one Buzard, (>9
j Martins, one Eagal, one Eagleson,

| seven Hawks, eight Partridges, one
I Cockerell. three Cocks, two Pea-
I cocks, one Starling, three Storkes, 17
i Robins, one Chick, one Thrasher, 13
| Drakes, nine Swans, two Buntings,
I and four Herrons.
Which brings us to the story about
I the Palo Alto lady who wanted her
| lawn mowed weekly, and went to
i the Student Employment Service to
j get help. The committee assured her
! a Rough would be sent once a week.
! The first week the student who came
| to take care of the grass was named
i Stubblefield. On the next occasion
! the ambitious lad who was sent was
| named Clover, which the lady man
i aged to laugh off, but the following
time her resistance was completely
broken when the arrival announced
himself as named Sprinkle.
