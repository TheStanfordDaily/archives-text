### George Spelvin 
After he had offered some sug
gestions to his players regarding the
final curtain of "The Bride the Sun
Shines On," Gordon Davis wan
dered with us down Geary street,
chatting about the play and his
plans for the next few months.

"The comedy," he said, "has been
a difficult one to stage, but now,
running as smoothly as it does, it is
amusing and should appeal to cam
pus audiences particularly. It is
farce, carefree and simple, built
about a second act curtain line
which always seems to panic audi
ences."
Davis, who has been in California
for several months, left for Holly
wood yesterday. He plans to sfay
there for the next several months.
