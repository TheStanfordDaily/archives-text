# STANFORD SUBS TRIPLE OVER ARMY, 26 TO 0
## Warner Keeps Undefeated Football Record Intact Without Regulars TARGHETTA BRILLIANT Afflerbaugh, Van Dellen Star Among Backs 
### Bob Letts 
Defeating West Coast Army by a
20-0 score Saturday afternoon in
Stanford Stadium was only a sec
ondary item for Pop Warner, Old
Fox of the Farm.
His principal concern before the
kickoff was to determine whether
he had sufficient reserve power in
his Cardinals to withstand the Jar
heads' threat, and save possible
punshment of his regulars. He had
it. The victory made it five in a row
for Stanford and left its record un
blemished as Warner settled down
today to prepare his proteges for the
outstanding battle of Stanford's
gridiron year—the University of
Southern California classic here this
weekend.
As for the game itself, Army
showed itself in all its glory right
after the first kickoff, and marched
75 yards before Stanford took the
ball on a punt on her own 10-yard
stripe.,
Power But No Points
The first quarter went scoreless.
It was strange, in view of the fact
that there were three sustained
drives of 75, 57, and 78 yards, re
spectively, in which neither team
could get into pay dirt. The first two
were by Coach Johnny Stokes' men,
and the other by Stanford, the lat
ter ending on the two-yard line
when Wes Stevens, Card fullback,
fumbled.
It didn't take the local college
boys long after that, Buck Van Del
len taking the ball from his left
halfback position and reversing
through left tackle for seven yards.
AfTlerbaugh's dropkick was blocked.
Seventy seconds before the half
ended, Stanford scored again, when
Dusty Allen shot a well-placed pass
to Alflerbaugh, who was in the
open. The entire Army defense had
closed in, and the pass was as easily
handled as two big leaguers playing ;
catch. Phil Johnston place-kicked |
the extra point, and Stanford left j
the field at the intermission with a j
13-0 lead.
White Goes Places
A 44-yard drive gave Stanford an- !
other score in the third period when j
Chuck White, who played a good ,
game at half, reversed through right
tackle for 12 yards and Johnston
again added the point.
The Indians' final tally came
shortly after the final session got
under way, and culminated a 68-
yard march. White scored this one, J
too, making four yards over right
tackle on the same reverse play
that he had scored on previously.
It appeared that he had been stopped
by four Jarheads, but they neglect
ed to put their little arms around '
him.
Now for the substitutes. From all
appearances, Warner has another;
guard who can be thrown against j
the S.C. Beef Trust. He is Red Tar- j
ghctta, a stumpy individual whose
footwork and speed remind one of (
Walt Heinecke, former Stanford all- j
American center. Targhetta, like i
Heinecke, is built close to the |
ground. He spent a good deal of i
time in the Army backfield, and was J
one reason why Stanford wasn't j
scored upon. Stemple, Presidio end, ,
took a pass from Motley and started j
goalward, apparently without trou- !
ble, but Targhetta pulled him down |
from the rear. It looked good.
And don't forget Kenny AfTler-
baugh. The boy was working bis
change of pace to a fare-thec-well,
and this with his speed combined to
qualify him for action against the
Trojans. He looked good enough to
give Bill Sim a rough run for the
starting assignment next Saturday.
Kenny did some nice punting, hav
ing a good eye for the coffin comer.
Van Dellen was outstanding. His
defensive work was particularly
good, and he plunged and twisted
his way to several first downs, in
addition to scoring once.
White looked good offensively. He
banged through right tackle for 26
yards at the end of the third quar
ter, and, with Van Dellen was the
spark plug of the last touchdown
drive.
Triple-Threat Anderson
Both fullbacks, Stevens and Stan
Anderson, did well for themselves.
Stevens hammered the Army line
all through the game, and has some
thing to show for his efforts in the
yardage statistics. Anderson acquit
ted himself well enough to show
U.S.C.'s scouts that Stanford has a
world of fullback material.
Pop was well pleased with the
way everything turned out. He saw
where pass defense was weak, but
there was no one injured. Every
thing worked as planned, and all
that remains is that Big Battle of
the Bruisers in the Bowl this week
end.

good, and he plunged and twisted
his way to several first downs, in
addition to scoring once.
White looked good offensively. He
banged through right tackle for 26
yards at the end of the third quar
ter, and, with Van Dellen was the
spark plug of the last touchdown
drive.
Triple-Threat Anderson
Both fullbacks, Stevens and Stan
Anderson, did well for themselves.
Stevens hammered the Army line
all through the game, and has some
thing to show for his efforts in the
yardage statistics. Anderson acquit
ted himself well enough to show
U.S.C.'s scouts that Stanford has a
world of fullback material.
Pop was well pleased with the
way everything turned out. He saw
where pass defense was weak, but
there was no one injured. Every
thing worked as planned, and all
that remains is that Big Battle of
the Bruisers in the Bowl this week
end.
Defeating West Coast Army by a
20-0 score Saturday afternoon in
Stanford Stadium was only a sec
ondary item for Pop Warner, Old
Fox of the Farm.
His principal concern before the
kickoff was to determine whether
he had sufficient reserve power in
his Cardinals to withstand the Jar
heads' threat, and save possible
punshment of his regulars. He had
it. The victory made it five in a row
for Stanford and left its record un
blemished as Warner settled down
today to prepare his proteges for the
outstanding battle of Stanford's
gridiron year—the University of
Southern California classic here this
weekend.
As for the game itself, Army
showed itself in all its glory right
after the first kickoff, and marched
75 yards before Stanford took the
ball on a punt on her own 10-yard
stripe.,
Power But No Points
The first quarter went scoreless.
It was strange, in view of the fact
that there were three sustained
drives of 75, 57, and 78 yards, re
spectively, in which neither team
could get into pay dirt. The first two
were by Coach Johnny Stokes' men,
and the other by Stanford, the lat
ter ending on the two-yard line
when Wes Stevens, Card fullback,
fumbled.
It didn't take the local college
boys long after that, Buck Van Del
len taking the ball from his left
halfback position and reversing
through left tackle for seven yards.
AfTlerbaugh's dropkick was blocked.
Seventy seconds before the half
ended, Stanford scored again, when
Dusty Allen shot a well-placed pass
to Alflerbaugh, who was in the
open. The entire Army defense had
closed in, and the pass was as easily
handled as two big leaguers playing ;
catch. Phil Johnston place-kicked |
the extra point, and Stanford left j
the field at the intermission with a j
13-0 lead.
White Goes Places
A 44-yard drive gave Stanford an- !
other score in the third period when j
Chuck White, who played a good ,
game at half, reversed through right
tackle for 12 yards and Johnston
again added the point.
The Indians' final tally came
shortly after the final session got
under way, and culminated a 68-
yard march. White scored this one, J
too, making four yards over right
tackle on the same reverse play
that he had scored on previously.
It appeared that he had been stopped
by four Jarheads, but they neglect
ed to put their little arms around '
him.
Now for the substitutes. From all
appearances, Warner has another;
guard who can be thrown against j
the S.C. Beef Trust. He is Red Tar- j
ghctta, a stumpy individual whose
footwork and speed remind one of (
Walt Heinecke, former Stanford all- j
American center. Targhetta, like i
Heinecke, is built close to the |
ground. He spent a good deal of i
time in the Army backfield, and was J
one reason why Stanford wasn't j
scored upon. Stemple, Presidio end, ,
took a pass from Motley and started j
goalward, apparently without trou- !
ble, but Targhetta pulled him down |
from the rear. It looked good.
And don't forget Kenny AfTler-
baugh. The boy was working bis
change of pace to a fare-thec-well,
and this with his speed combined to
qualify him for action against the
Trojans. He looked good enough to
give Bill Sim a rough run for the
starting assignment next Saturday.
Kenny did some nice punting, hav
ing a good eye for the coffin comer.

baugh. The boy was working bis
change of pace to a fare-thec-well,
and this with his speed combined to
qualify him for action against the
Trojans. He looked good enough to
give Bill Sim a rough run for the
starting assignment next Saturday.
Kenny did some nice punting, hav
ing a good eye for the coffin comer.
Van Dellen was outstanding. His
defensive work was particularly
good, and he plunged and twisted
his way to several first downs, in
addition to scoring once.
White looked good offensively. He
banged through right tackle for 26
yards at the end of the third quar
ter, and, with Van Dellen was the
spark plug of the last touchdown
drive.
Triple-Threat Anderson
Both fullbacks, Stevens and Stan
Anderson, did well for themselves.
Stevens hammered the Army line
all through the game, and has some
thing to show for his efforts in the
yardage statistics. Anderson acquit
ted himself well enough to show
U.S.C.'s scouts that Stanford has a

Defeating West Coast Army by a
20-0 score Saturday afternoon in
Stanford Stadium was only a sec
ondary item for Pop Warner, Old
Fox of the Farm.
His principal concern before the
kickoff was to determine whether
he had sufficient reserve power in
his Cardinals to withstand the Jar
heads' threat, and save possible
punshment of his regulars. He had
it. The victory made it five in a row
for Stanford and left its record un
blemished as Warner settled down
today to prepare his proteges for the
outstanding battle of Stanford's
gridiron year—the University of
Southern California classic here this
weekend.
As for the game itself, Army
showed itself in all its glory right
after the first kickoff, and marched
75 yards before Stanford took the
ball on a punt on her own 10-yard
stripe.,
Power But No Points
The first quarter went scoreless.
It was strange, in view of the fact
that there were three sustained
drives of 75, 57, and 78 yards, re
spectively, in which neither team
could get into pay dirt. The first two
were by Coach Johnny Stokes' men,
and the other by Stanford, the lat
ter ending on the two-yard line
when Wes Stevens, Card fullback,
fumbled.
It didn't take the local college
boys long after that, Buck Van Del
len taking the ball from his left
halfback position and reversing
through left tackle for seven yards.
AfTlerbaugh's dropkick was blocked.
Seventy seconds before the half
ended, Stanford scored again, when
Dusty Allen shot a well-placed pass
to Alflerbaugh, who was in the
open. The entire Army defense had
closed in, and the pass was as easily
handled as two big leaguers playing ;
catch. Phil Johnston place-kicked |
the extra point, and Stanford left j
the field at the intermission with a j
13-0 lead.
White Goes Places
A 44-yard drive gave Stanford an- !
other score in the third period when j
Chuck White, who played a good ,
game at half, reversed through right
tackle for 12 yards and Johnston
again added the point.
The Indians' final tally came
shortly after the final session got
under way, and culminated a 68-
yard march. White scored this one, J
too, making four yards over right
tackle on the same reverse play
that he had scored on previously.
It appeared that he had been stopped
by four Jarheads, but they neglect
ed to put their little arms around '
him.
Now for the substitutes. From all
appearances, Warner has another;
guard who can be thrown against j
the S.C. Beef Trust. He is Red Tar- j
ghctta, a stumpy individual whose
footwork and speed remind one of (
Walt Heinecke, former Stanford all- j
American center. Targhetta, like i
Heinecke, is built close to the |
ground. He spent a good deal of i
time in the Army backfield, and was J
one reason why Stanford wasn't j
scored upon. Stemple, Presidio end, ,
took a pass from Motley and started j
goalward, apparently without trou- !
ble, but Targhetta pulled him down |
from the rear. It looked good.
And don't forget Kenny AfTler-
baugh. The boy was working bis
change of pace to a fare-thec-well,
and this with his speed combined to
qualify him for action against the
Trojans. He looked good enough to
give Bill Sim a rough run for the
