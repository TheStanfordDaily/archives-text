# Bar Women At Pyre Building
## 
### 
That freshman women should be
barred from serving food to the men
building the bonfire was decided by
A.W.S. Conference at a meeting last
week.
The action was taken following
the success of a similar program put
in effect last year. General confu
sion resulting from the issuance of
late leaves, as well as from the
presence of women while construc
tion is under progress made the
former system unsatisfactory in the
opinion of members of Conference.
It is expected that the present pol
icy will be continued in the future.
Conference also laid stress on the
regulation providing that there shall
be no smoking by Stanford women
in the Stadium during football
games. So far this quarter the rule
has been very generally ignored.
Strict enforcement of the honor
code and of the rule prohibiting
women's drinking were upheld.
