# College Attendance Cut By Old Man Depression

Although fewer students throng
the halls of learning on the Farm
this year, other coast institutions
engaged in dealing out higher cul
ture find that their campi ai'e even
more thinly covered than Stanford's.
Of course the depression is blamed
for the nine per cent decrease at
Stanford. But other schools are in
the same boat. Up at Corvallis when
the officials of the Oregon State Col
lege counted noses there were 29
per cent less of the proboscides
visible than in 1931. The actual en
rollment figures show a total of 2190
students as compared with 3030 last
year.
At Eugene, home town of the Uni
versity of Oregon, there afe 18 per
cent less students from whom to
solicit laundry and cleaning. Only

' 2238 students registered as com- J
J pared with 2870 last year. Of course
J some of the drop in the Oregon
I schools' enrollment is blamed on the
J current proposal to combine the two
j institutions.
The University of Washington at j
Seattle reports a ten per cent do- >
i crease in number of students. Its,
sister institution at Pullman, the j
1 Washington State College, registered J
12 per cent less students, 2700 as j
i compared with 3100 last year.
The tuition-free state institutions
;in California, the University of
California at Berkeley and at Los |
! Angeles experience no decrease. The
College of the Pacific, a private in
stitution at Stockton, reports 556
students this year and 719 last year,
! a 22 per cent drop.
