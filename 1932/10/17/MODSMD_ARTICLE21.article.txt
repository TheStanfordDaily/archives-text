# Political Debate Will Be Held At Campus Forum
## Orators Represent Party Clubs In Discussions 
### 
Like hostile hounds, straining at
the leash, campus political clubs are
preparing to fly at each other's
i throats in joint debate over the
| presidential issue on Thursday, Oc-
I tober 27.
An da real dog-fight it promises
to be, with Pi Sigma Alpha, politi
| cal science fraternity, sponsoring the
i clash in the form of an open forum.
The audience will be allowed to pop
questions at the debaters, who in
turn will cross-question each other.
Campaigners Enter
The Democratic, Republican, and
, Socialist clubs have already entered
1 the contest, but nothing has been
j heard from the sympathizers of
j minor candidates.
It is understood that the campus
| Democrats are now in the process
of organization, whila Socialist ora
tors will compete in tryouts this
i afternoon for the privilege of repre- j
! senting their club.
Meanwhile, the student campaign- j
J ers are bombarding the campus with j
campaign literature. Friday the Uni- J
versity administration, upon re
; quest of the Thomas-for-President
Club, granted permission to dis
tribute literature on the campus, j
providing it is not derogatory to
I any candidate. Thereupon the club j
announced that it would distribute!
; Socialist material this morning at a i
table on the east side of the Quad, '
near the engineering corner.
Pamphlets Distributed
The Hoover Club had previously
! been handing out pamphlets, but
| tons, and stickers. Those to be dis
j tributed at the Socialist table were
purchased by the students with
j funds collected at the last meeting
! of the club.
The time and place of the open |
forum will be announced later, as j
well as the names of those chosen i
, to speak.
