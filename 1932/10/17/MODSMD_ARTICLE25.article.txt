to join the procession, which is
routed to proceed down to the Row
and around to the Pavilion for the
rally.
A gigantic torchlight parade has
i been planned, it was revealed. A
score of flares are being prepared to
accompany the procession as it
moves over the campus.
Those who do not ride in the cars
will form a long cavalcade in the
rear and march behind the Stanford
band, which will play on tlje way
to the rally.
Cigarettes For All
As the men file into the Pavilion,
each will be given a package of
cigarettes of a popular brand. How
ever, they will be asked not to use
them until after the rally.
