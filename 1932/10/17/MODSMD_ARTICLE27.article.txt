# ALL-UNIVERSITY MUD FIGHT
## 
### 
All right, follows, let's linve the mud light. Let's have
Iwo mini fights. Lei's have a mud light every afternoon, a
four-sided battle with each contingent lighting unto death
for the honor of \'W, or \'W. If the graduates care to partici
pate, let's have them in the light too "Upholding the
prestige of '2N, a small hand is heating off the tremendous
army of making up in experience what it lacks in num
bers." That's the touch. The touch of the good old days
when "frosh" had to wear green lids.
Or, better still, let's have an all-University mud fight,
including the trustees, the administration, the faculty, and
the Hoard of Athletic Control.
Xo matter if a score are killed, and three score injured.
Think of the FI X of swallowing enough mud to become
vomiting ill. And it will be simple to console the injured
men. Tell them they should be glad to die for dear old '3(i,
bul don't try to tell them just why. That's unnecessary. And
besides, you might find yourself groping for answers that
don't exist. Thai's always unpleasant. Almost as unpleas
ant as having ;i broken collar bone, or a torn ligament.
Xor worry not because at first nobody will show up for
an all-University mud light, any more than they do now
for all-University assembly. Make it compulsory. Put it in
the Handbook. Hell, put it in the constitution. That'll lix
it so the frosh won't be left almost alone to fight among
themselves. For then everyone, instead of just the yearlings,
will feel that he must be in the mud light or be scorned by
his fellows. Men who have been around here for years and
know enough not to risk limbs and fight fellows for no rea
son at all will come to believe, just as the blameless fresh
men now believe, that it is official, the tiling to do. Yes,
by all that's holy, it WILL be official.
Strike up the hand, (let on the wagon. Aboard, fellows,
for the all-University mud fight.

Think of the FI X of swallowing enough mud to become
vomiting ill. And it will be simple to console the injured
men. Tell them they should be glad to die for dear old '3(i,
bul don't try to tell them just why. That's unnecessary. And
besides, you might find yourself groping for answers that
don't exist. Thai's always unpleasant. Almost as unpleas
ant as having ;i broken collar bone, or a torn ligament.
Xor worry not because at first nobody will show up for
an all-University mud light, any more than they do now
for all-University assembly. Make it compulsory. Put it in
the Handbook. Hell, put it in the constitution. That'll lix
it so the frosh won't be left almost alone to fight among
themselves. For then everyone, instead of just the yearlings,
will feel that he must be in the mud light or be scorned by
his fellows. Men who have been around here for years and
know enough not to risk limbs and fight fellows for no rea
son at all will come to believe, just as the blameless fresh
men now believe, that it is official, the tiling to do. Yes,
by all that's holy, it WILL be official.
Strike up the hand, (let on the wagon. Aboard, fellows,
for the all-University mud fight.
