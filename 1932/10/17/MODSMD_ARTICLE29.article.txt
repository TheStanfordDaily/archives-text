# MUSIC MISPLACED
## 
### 
There is a time and a place for everything, and one of j
the times and one of tlu 1 places that people don't want ton
hear a musical concert is during a football game. When
that time-out conies for Joe Stopem, who lost an arm on
the gridiron, that festive spirit should not he lost hut
rather increased by the selections from the hand.
Our honorable opponents, and there are many, have,,
always made the Stanford stands green with envy hy the]
up-to-the-niinute and snappy tunes which their hand would
play for them. The opposing rooting section enjoyed these
airs and were, as a result, in a very receptive mood the
next time they were called on for a "locomotive" by the
cheer leaders.
The Daily has no bone to pick with the hand itself,
which plays better and maneuvers more skillfully than any 1
other organization of ils kind 011 Ihc coast. However, the j
band's selection of incidental music, apart from Stanford
songs, might be chosen with an eye more to the occasion
at which they are being played, than for their contribution |
to immortal music.
