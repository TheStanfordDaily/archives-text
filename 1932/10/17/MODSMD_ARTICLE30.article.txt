# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SLEAZY GOOSE 
### 
Last year, a new idea struck
the campus pocketbook with great
success. Christened "Depression
Dances"—and patronized by prac
tically everybody but a blithering
few who thought themselves too
something-or-other to rub calves
with the hoi-polloi—the thing
spread. The only weakness in the
system was the certainty that sooner
or later too many roughs would be
present.
And that certainty broke with a
horrific cloudburst at Saturday's
cut-rate terpsichorean tussle over at
the Women's Gym. The roughs
weren't stags any longer. They were
starved wolves pacing back and
forth across the floor in futile search
of the where-with-all with which to
dance.
While lights blazed forth from
Roble's windows —where many of
the "500" hastily decided they just
had to catch up on their studying—
the shortage of gliding beauties at
the Gym became pitifully acute. And
while some of the sorority houses
may have been more discreet in
showing lights before one o'clock,
they nevertheless contributed 4o the
scarcity.
When roughs were merely thick
as flies, men didn't object particu
larly to dragging their gorgeous
darlings to these depression dances.
But the situation has been going
down hill for so long—that it's now
difficult to toll whether these Gym
affairs are smokers—or dances. The
Golden Goose of reasonably priced
entertainment has laid itself dry.
The poor duck is just a sleazy
shadow of its former self. Mourning
Becomes Depression-Dances!
But the demand and desire for
campus dances goes right on—un
abated. Those that have neither or

, either the desire or finances to run
! up to the city at the drop of the
hat, still like to do something Friday
I and Saturday nights besides bridge
:—a show in Paly—or other equally
puerile amusement.

There is room for weekly dances
on the campus—similar in nature to
the Registration Dance. At a dollar
or less a throw, the things would be
as popular as Hollywood imports at
a Roble jolly-up. The roughs would
not monopolize the scene; and men
would not fear for their heart's de
sire in that stunning brown fall
creation. It would be possible to
bring a date without having her
pass hands as rapidly as the pig
skin in a Warner octagonal reverse.
Men wouldn't get broken shoulder
blades from being tapped—and gen
erally a good time would be had
by all.

There probably will not be or
ganizations to sponsor these dances
every week. But that shouldn't be a
deterrent. The Executive Committee
can render a real service to the
campus by putting on these hops.
With no desire to make profit, the
affairs needn't be tinny. Of course,
when big campus dances were
scheduled, it would be foolish to
run ruinous competition.
Or it may even be a good idea to
have 35 cent shuffles every week
without the hordes of escort-less
males. When the rough was the ex
ception, he may have added to the
fun; but as soon as he becomes the
rule, he ceases to be amusingly
unique and by an easy alchemy is
transformed into a general annoy
ance. Whether the dances should be
25 cents, 35 cents, 4 bits, or two for
66 Va, is not so important as the fact
that depression-priced entertain
ment is fast becoming, like salt in
the stew, a NECESSITY.
