EARL BURTNETT'S ORCHESTRA.
at the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
"On with the dancin'"—but An-,
son is gone and so Earl Burtnett is
pinch-hitting and filling well those
deeply rooted shoes left yawning in
the Peacock Court. Earl has a tooth
ful smile, not quite so truthful as
the Phil Harris grimace but at least |
reminiscent of our departed hero.
And while we're on comparisons,
we might mention the slight resem
blance of the Burtnett orchestrations ;
to those of his composer contem
porary at the St. Francis. Although
the rhythm beats are not so con
sistently confined to the horn sec
tion as they are in the Fio-Rito
makeup, still it is pleasantly evident
that the drummer is no longer the
sole tempo marker.
Something that will please you is !
the presence of a piano accordion as
a part of the regular organization— |
and something that will delight your |
heart, is the tenor voice of Vernon
Rickard, already famous from the
pictures "Topsy and Eva" and
"Smilin' Thru." In fact, if Mr. Mark
Hopkins would fix his apt-to-blare j
amplifier, everything should be ex- i
cellent. —E.E.H.

As rapidly as Zane Grey is able
to write thrillers of the unconquered '
West, Paramount makes them into !
pictures. There is about the expanse
of the scene and the frank melo
dramatics of the tale a certain easy j
pleasure.
This film is no exception to the
rule for all thrillers. It is rapid, and
vigorous. It will please those who
like, occasionally, a change from
drawing-room comedy and bath
room farce. It is harmless and never
subtle. —G.F.S.
SMILIN' THROUGH (Metro)—At |
the Stanford Theatre.
It is difficult to find fault with
an old sentimental favorite, . but j
Metro's version of Smilin' Through
leaves a good deal to be desired.
The primary fault is its preoccu
pation with hysterical amours and
the overemphasis of the modern
side of the story. In the stage play
the second act —a cutback, fifty
years before the first—was its most ■
important sequence.

! In the picture this is converted I
into a ten-minute bit and the great j
part of the action concerns the !
: strivings of Miss Norma Shearer to |
! allay the rooted wrath of Leslie j
Howard. There is added a familiar ,
scene of lovers' quarreling which j
not only prolongs the film unneces- ;
sarily but is a decidedly unfair at- j
tempt to wring tears which refuse j
to be wrung.
The most delightful moments are |
those of light comedy between I
' Shearer and Fredric March. But j
j these always have a tendency to
I lapse into further hysteria.
The film may please a great many j
! people but an audience will per
j ceive at once, if not its basic weak- ;
1 ness—sentimentality, which which, j
if well done, I have no argument—
j but further, the unoriginal additions
j and the undue and unfair scenes
! of tearful farewell—after witty con
i versation which would indicate, at
j least, a modicum of sane self-con- j
trol in the characters.
Beautifully made, well-cast, the t
film is still hampered by these un- j
' fortunate factors. It might be aided i
j by considerable cutting, particularly i
' of the final problem. —J.S.S.

"On with the dancin'"—but An-,
son is gone and so Earl Burtnett is
pinch-hitting and filling well those
deeply rooted shoes left yawning in
the Peacock Court. Earl has a tooth
ful smile, not quite so truthful as
the Phil Harris grimace but at least |
reminiscent of our departed hero.
And while we're on comparisons,
we might mention the slight resem
blance of the Burtnett orchestrations ;
to those of his composer contem
porary at the St. Francis. Although
the rhythm beats are not so con
sistently confined to the horn sec
tion as they are in the Fio-Rito
makeup, still it is pleasantly evident
that the drummer is no longer the
sole tempo marker.
Something that will please you is !
the presence of a piano accordion as
a part of the regular organization— |
and something that will delight your |
heart, is the tenor voice of Vernon
Rickard, already famous from the
pictures "Topsy and Eva" and
"Smilin' Thru." In fact, if Mr. Mark
Hopkins would fix his apt-to-blare j
amplifier, everything should be ex- i
cellent. —E.E.H.

It is difficult to find fault with

leaves a good deal to be desired.
The primary fault is its preoccu

the overemphasis of the modern
