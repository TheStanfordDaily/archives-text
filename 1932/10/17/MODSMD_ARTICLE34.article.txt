The market closed steadier over
the week-end. The trend lately has
j been such as to drive New York
market letter men to send out blank
I sheets and look longingly at the top
floor of the Empire State Building.
' The car loading statement, released
i Saturday, showed an inci'ease over
I the previous week, though still con
i siderably below last year. Tele
| phone's nine month's showing,
j slightly below dividend require
j ments, was in line with expectations
i and the stock held well.
Roosevelt's assertions tending to
; show that he was not an ultra
-1 radical in his sweat to bring about
j a "new deal" helped to improve
j market sentiment.
The early part of this month un
! doubtedly witnessed liquidating
j operations on the part of some pools,
i which had realized substantial
profits over extended operations
from around the end of July. Other
pools, attempting to carry commit
ments through the falling market,
i probably were forced to sell.
The market has sold consistently
| lower against better trade news. Yet
: the underlying basis of security
j prices is the stability and prosperity
| of general business. Thus the pic
! lure may be likened to that of a
j sick man who groans with gusto
j while his pulse and temperature
I show constant improvement. Ulti
mately, the true state of things will
have its effect on the outer appear
ance.
