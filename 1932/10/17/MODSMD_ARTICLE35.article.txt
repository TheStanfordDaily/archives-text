j Mr. Editor:
I may be all wrong, but I thought: |
That a football rally was a meet- |
ing presided over by a yell leader'
I and for the purpose of showing OUR !
! football team that we were behind !
j them to a man and pushing them I
| to win.
j That it was a place where men,
i gave vent to their feeling concern
ing the game and "pepped" up stu
j dents who were already frenzied.
That it was the funeral dirge for
j the enemy.
That here we buried him in effigy
j and banded ourselves together in j
I preparation for burying him in the
I flesh on the next Saturday.
That it was a place where the j
! band appeared and cut loose play- ;
, ing "Hail, Hail, the gang's all here" !
: and the gang was all there.
That it was a place where old
j grads sang of the "glories that
were" and to silence them we went j
out on the Saturday of the game
and made them marvel at the glories I
that ARE.
Perhaps you can tell me just what
in is a football rally?
Yours for a rally, not dance.

The Editor, Sir

Perhaps I should address this to
Mr. Churchill, the head of the Rally ]
Committee. I have always been very '
much interested in the social whirl |
on the Stanford campus and I want
to commend the committee for put
ting the cheering section on the
high place which it so justly de
serves. In the past I abhorred the
plebian gatherings termed rallies
where idiotic students threw all de
cency aside and behaved like mad
men instead of the refined scholarly
type of gentlemen for which Stan
ford is noted.
Dancing is so much more inspir
ing than the degrading turmoil that
the Pavilion has turned into at past
rallies and it doesn't tire one nearly
so much. To be perfectly frank, I
feel that an evening in the company
of the lady of one's choice, with in
telligent conversation, and to the
music of a famous dance band, is
far more valuable than wasting
time trying to raise the passions of
those huge football bruisers so that
they will go out and injure one an
other physically. I'm a pacifist and
after all one must stand by his con
victions. I trust that the affair next
Wednesday will be formal and feel
it would be a wonderful time to be
of great service to the Stanford
\vomen by re-establir.hing the cus
tom of having the gentlemen take
corsages to the ladies. It is very
regrettable that this practice has
died out here of all places. A few
events like you propose will nicely
force from the picture entirely that
crude type, the Stanford rough who
certainly has no places on this cam
pus.
Never before have I been so for
ward as to write to a newspaper
column, but I felt I just had to let
the students know how I felt about
this fine step in the right direction.
After a few years of refined action
we may be able to do away with
football entirely. If that is hoping
for too much we can at least set the
j example for the U.S.C. boys of how
! gentlemen should conduct them
selves.

men instead of the refined scholarly
type of gentlemen for which Stan
ford is noted.
Dancing is so much more inspir
ing than the degrading turmoil that
the Pavilion has turned into at past
rallies and it doesn't tire one nearly
so much. To be perfectly frank, I
feel that an evening in the company
of the lady of one's choice, with in
telligent conversation, and to the
music of a famous dance band, is
far more valuable than wasting
time trying to raise the passions of
those huge football bruisers so that
they will go out and injure one an
other physically. I'm a pacifist and
after all one must stand by his con
victions. I trust that the affair next
Wednesday will be formal and feel
it would be a wonderful time to be
of great service to the Stanford
\vomen by re-establir.hing the cus
tom of having the gentlemen take
corsages to the ladies. It is very
regrettable that this practice has
died out here of all places. A few
events like you propose will nicely
force from the picture entirely that
crude type, the Stanford rough who
certainly has no places on this cam
pus.
Never before have I been so for
ward as to write to a newspaper
column, but I felt I just had to let
the students know how I felt about
this fine step in the right direction.
After a few years of refined action
we may be able to do away with
football entirely. If that is hoping
for too much we can at least set the
j example for the U.S.C. boys of how
! gentlemen should conduct them
selves.

j Mr. Editor:
I may be all wrong, but I thought: |
That a football rally was a meet- |
ing presided over by a yell leader'
I and for the purpose of showing OUR !
! football team that we were behind !
j them to a man and pushing them I
| to win.
j That it was a place where men,
i gave vent to their feeling concern
ing the game and "pepped" up stu
j dents who were already frenzied.
That it was the funeral dirge for
j the enemy.
That here we buried him in effigy
j and banded ourselves together in j
I preparation for burying him in the
I flesh on the next Saturday.
That it was a place where the j
! band appeared and cut loose play- ;
, ing "Hail, Hail, the gang's all here" !
: and the gang was all there.
That it was a place where old
j grads sang of the "glories that
were" and to silence them we went j
out on the Saturday of the game
and made them marvel at the glories I
that ARE.
Perhaps you can tell me just what
in is a football rally?
