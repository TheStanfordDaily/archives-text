# U.C.L.A. Frosh Fall Before Cards, 25-0
## OFFICIALS, BEEFY SOUTHERNERS FAIL TO STOP PAPOOSES Stanford Scores Six Times But Two Touchdowns Called Back 
### Dick Strouse 
Scoring .six touchdowns and re
ceiving credit for four of them,
Stanford's freshman football team
defeated eleven first-year players
from U.C.L.A. and one first-year
head linesman 25 to 0 Saturday af
ternoon. The undefeated yearlings
made a touchdown th;.t counted in
every quarter, and two others for
glory if not for gain.
The freshmen were so overcome
by the bright lights of Los Angeles
that they completely forgot their
innate prejudice against first-half
touchdowns. Recovering a poor
U.C.L.A. kick within five minutes
of the start of the game, the year
lings shook Bob Hamilton loose for
a 35-yard run and a score.
"You Can't Do That"
However, the play was called back
as an official had been practicing
on his whistle during Bob's run.
Stanford was penalized for holding
in order to ratify the referee's un
timely puff, which apparently was
due to a premature thought that
someone would tackle Hamilton. The
frosh then drove down the field and
Frank Alustiza scored a touchdown
that met the sanction of the officials.
The Papooses made several other
sustained drives in the first quar
ter, but each time an official, by the
use of a 15-yard penalty, stopped
them. Hamilton made his contribu
tion to the day's total of scores
that-were-allowed in the second
quarter and, with the score 12 to 0 |
Winterburn put in his second team.
Running Guards Who Run
Stanford's power, which reduced;
U.C.L.A.'s defense to crumbling im- j
potency, was made possible to a j
considerable extent by the block-!
ing of Laurie Rouble and Woody
Adams. Leading the plays, these'
two running guards who really ran,!
cleared a path through which the ]
proverbial horse and wagon would j
have been able to navigate with a j
load of hay.
But horse and wagon were busy !
in the Olympic Stadium, where 1
U.S.C. was holding Loyola in a hard !
battle. So the Card backs took ad- j
vantage of tfie openings made by j
Rouble, Adams, Hoos, Callaway, j
Reynolds, etc., Grayson scoring the j
third and Alustiza the fourth touch- j
downs.
Grayson Does It Twice
Grayson made a nice 30-yard run
to tally, but was called back and j
Stanford penalized 25 yards, the of- i
ficials apparently wanting to see j
him do it again. So, on the next i
play, Grayson took the ball for a ;
55-yard trip, thus proving that he |
was entitled to a touchdown by :
making it twice. As a fact for sta- j
tistical fiends to ponder, Winterburn j
estimated that Stanford was penal- j
ized 130 yards during the game. |
U.C.L.A. outweighed Stanford j
about 15 pounds to the man in the i
line, and yet their size meant j
nothing before the Card drive. Stan- J
ford also resorted to some fancy

work, scoring their second touch
down on a forward-lateral pass. The
regulars were returned to the game
near the end of the final period for
the purpose of trying a trick play.
They tried, and the play was stopped
at the line of scrimmage.

Picking out stars is hard, as
U.C.L.A., in spite of the efforts of a
back named Cheshire, threatened
only once late in the game due to
two passes completed against the
Stanford substitutes. Moscrip, who
made the only conversion of the
game, and Kingsbury are two pow
erful right ends, and Todd looked
good in his first appearance as a
fullback.

The Stanford campus was in great
commotion Saturday afternoon, as
some of tho blatant gentlemen whose
! business it is to advertise football
I games, Amos and Andy, and tomato
| soup over the -radio, informed the
world that U.C.L.A. had won. But
j the freshmen, who returned yester
j day morning, quelled all such
I slander.
