# S.C., U.C. MEET REAL OPPOSITION
## 
### 
While the Stanford Indians were
taking the West Coast Army into
j camp Saturday, the other two big
time elevens in the state were run
ning into a lot of trouble. The little
! Loyola Lions fought the U.S.C. Tro
jans on almost even terms for 55
minutes to lose by a meager G-0.
Over at Berkeley the Washington
State Cougars gave Navy Bill In
gram's hideless Bears a neat but not
gj udy trimming to the tune of 7-2.
Though it was apparent that
Howard Jones had his squad under
cover for this week's Indian battle;
nevertheless the Trojan Head Man
had to use his first string before
the Lions could be subdued. If it
had not been for a penalty that put
the ball on the Loyola three-yard
line for the Trojans in the last five
minutes of play, the game would
probably have ended scorelessly.
Seven and a half seconds were all
that the Cougars needed in the
California Memorial Stadium. Five
of the seconds were occupied by
Ollie Arbelbide, small brother of
the famous Trojan end Garrett, in
running from his own 45-yard line
to the payoff patch defended by the
battered Bears. The rest of the time
this sophomore Cougar spent hold
ing the ball for conversion.
