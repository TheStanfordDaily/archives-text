"WE WERE TOUGH LAST
SATURDAY for the first time
this season; from now on we'll
be tougher."
So said the great Ingram after his
Bears went wild over their "moral
defeat" of St. Mary's a week ago.
If this last Saturday's demonstra
tion of how tough the Bears are
going to be from week to week is
any indication of their probable
rate of improvement, they won't
win a conference game. They had
Schaldach back in the game. They
weren't held down by a lot of crip
ples. They have one of the greatest
potential teams in the country, and
yet they couldn't cash in on one of
their FOUR chances within twenty
yards of scoring territory.
The Bears lack punch in more
ways than in ability to score points.
They give the impression of being
without any teamwork, and lacking i
in most of the fundamentals. If their i
work yesterday was any sample of
their ability, they couldn't block the
water wagon off the field.
Schaldach is good, and if the boys
ever decide to help him out now and
then he will make it darned un
comfortable for the opposition, but
when one, lone Cougar can brush
the Bear interference aside and
calmly drop the runner for a five
or ten-yard loss, there is something
radically wrong with the pre-season
favorite.

THE EX COMMITTEE DID
PRETTY WELL in the way of
handing out varsity sweaters
for accomplishments during the
late Olympic Games, but they
overlooked one young man who
did very well even if he didn't

thrill the multitude in the sta
dium.
That young man was Bill Hard
ing, and he placed sixth in the in
dividual rifle shooting to garner one
point for your Uncle Sammy. It hap
pens that his score was just two
digits behind that of the winner,
and he was relegated to sixth place
merely because of the intricate way
that hits are scored.
It also happens that sixth place in
the competition was first place for
any American, so draw your own
conclusions as to where the lad
stands on the national ladder.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE who think that Stan
ford should immediately resume
crew, just because U.C.L.A. has
taken it up, the recent audi
tor's report from California is
most illuminating. It seems that
crew, in an institution where it
is firmly established and im
mensely popular. lost a cool
$41,551.65. When all minor sports
arc taking it on the chin, and
even the major ones are being
beseeched to economize, it is
nothing short of laughable to
talk of dragging out the rowing
corpse.
Rowing is one of those "sport of
kings" affairs that is great to watch
and have around, but painful to
support. It is difficult to get a
stretch long enough for practice and
competition, but it is almost impos
sible to fix the Ihing up so that you
can make money off the spectators.
The Olympic Rowing Course at
Long Beach is about a third as long
as the intercollegiate distance and
yet they only manage to collect
money on half of it. R.D.W.Jr.

"WE WERE TOUGH LAST
SATURDAY for the first time
this season; from now on we'll
be tougher."
So said the great Ingram after his
Bears went wild over their "moral
defeat" of St. Mary's a week ago.
If this last Saturday's demonstra
tion of how tough the Bears are
going to be from week to week is
any indication of their probable
rate of improvement, they won't
win a conference game. They had
Schaldach back in the game. They
weren't held down by a lot of crip
ples. They have one of the greatest
potential teams in the country, and
yet they couldn't cash in on one of
their FOUR chances within twenty
yards of scoring territory.
The Bears lack punch in more
ways than in ability to score points.
They give the impression of being
without any teamwork, and lacking i
in most of the fundamentals. If their i
work yesterday was any sample of
their ability, they couldn't block the
water wagon off the field.
Schaldach is good, and if the boys
ever decide to help him out now and
then he will make it darned un
comfortable for the opposition, but
when one, lone Cougar can brush
the Bear interference aside and
calmly drop the runner for a five
or ten-yard loss, there is something
radically wrong with the pre-season
favorite.

THE EX COMMITTEE DID
PRETTY WELL in the way of
handing out varsity sweaters
for accomplishments during the
late Olympic Games, but they
overlooked one young man who
did very well even if he didn't

thrill the multitude in the sta
dium.
That young man was Bill Hard
ing, and he placed sixth in the in
dividual rifle shooting to garner one
point for your Uncle Sammy. It hap
pens that his score was just two
digits behind that of the winner,
and he was relegated to sixth place
merely because of the intricate way
that hits are scored.
It also happens that sixth place in
the competition was first place for
any American, so draw your own
conclusions as to where the lad
stands on the national ladder.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE who think that Stan
ford should immediately resume
crew, just because U.C.L.A. has
taken it up, the recent audi
tor's report from California is
most illuminating. It seems that
crew, in an institution where it
is firmly established and im
mensely popular. lost a cool
$41,551.65. When all minor sports
arc taking it on the chin, and
even the major ones are being
beseeched to economize, it is
nothing short of laughable to
talk of dragging out the rowing
corpse.
Rowing is one of those "sport of
kings" affairs that is great to watch
and have around, but painful to
support. It is difficult to get a
stretch long enough for practice and
competition, but it is almost impos
sible to fix the Ihing up so that you
can make money off the spectators.
The Olympic Rowing Course at
Long Beach is about a third as long
as the intercollegiate distance and
yet they only manage to collect
money on half of it. R.D.W.Jr.
