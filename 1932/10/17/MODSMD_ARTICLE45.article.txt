# INDIAN â€“ JAYSEE SOCCER BATTLE ENDS IN 2-2 TIE
## Art Hearn Scores Twice In Second Half, Breaks San Mateo Lead 
### 
What looked like a very sure
Stanford defeat at the hands of the
San Mateo Junior College soccer
eleven was turned into a 2-2 tie
when a scrappy, though badly or
ganized, squad of Indian booters
made up a two-goal handicap in the
last part of the second half at San
Mateo Saturday morning.
It was Art Hearn who pulled
Stanford out of the hole with a pair
of neatly placed kicks after the
Junior College team had increased
its lead of two goals at the beginning
of the second half. Hearn sent the
first one through the goal after a
pass from Kennedy, and the score
remained at 2-1 for some time.
Neat Passing
The next score came when the
game had about ten minutes left
to go. White threw in to the outside
left, Gas Rojas, who sent the ball
across the field to Cy Johnson, at
inside right. Johnson played to get
his bearings and then passed it to
Hearn who was waiting at the left
hand corner of the goal area. Then
with a left-footed kick, Hearn drove
the ball so hard that it went right
through the waiting hands of the
San Mateo goalie.
San Mateo got its first score on a
penalty kick after Nif Branch, Stan
ford fullback, had touched the ball
with his hands. Goalie Brekelbaum
was drawn out of position at the
beginning of the second half, with
San Mateo in possession of the ball,
and they scored again.
Lineup Changed
Coach Maloney made several
changes in his lineup during the
course of the game. Knecht shifted
to inside left, with Rojas filling his
outside left spot, Nicoll went to right
half and Kennedy to center, and
Brekelbaum moved from goalie
back to his original fullback posi
tion, replacing Washburn, with
Newman carrying on in the goal.
