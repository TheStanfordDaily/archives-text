With the men from A.K.L. as the
lone league winners of last year;
scheduled for the play-offs today, I
the games can be considered only j
as toss-ups with no predictions to |
be advanced. The 3G organizations j
entered in the season's play are j
starting from scratch.
Reserves Not Limited
A strong reserve strength to bol- j
ster the regular seven-man teams i
from the listed organizations would I
be in order after a glance at the
1 ules governing the mural sport.
During a 20-minute half a team may
use a player only once. An inter
mission of five minutes will be |
called between halves. Under such I
circumstances no limit is placed |
upon the reserve strength of a team, j
The rules, however, allow for a
minimum of six men to the team.
No defense may leave the ground
in making a touch to halt an of- j
fensive runner. This new rule is j
equivalent to the regular sports rul
ing which prohibits the flying i
tackle. In case of a fumble or a ;
lateral pass the official rules apply.'
