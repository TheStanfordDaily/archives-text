# Major Upsets In Football Shown On Both Coasts
## Southern Squads Play True To Form Saturday 
### Robert Denton 
There were upsets a-plenty on
the gridirons of "these United
States" Saturday afternoon, with
the most serious jolts to alumni
pride fairly evenly divided between
the Atlantic Seaboard and the Pa
cific Coast. Midwestern and South
ern teams played true to form.
Washington State's 7-2 victory
over the California Golden Bears
eliminated Bill Ingram's team from
any consideration in the national
reckonings, and focussed the spot
light oh Stanford's game against
Southern California next Saturday.
While Pop Warner's second- and
third-string Indians were coasting
over the West Coast Army, U.S.C.'s
Trojans met a tartar in little Loyola,
and it took Howard Jones' eleven
fifty minutes of rather questionable
football to put over a touchdown.
Merriwell Finish
At Portland, U.C.L.A., the latest
newcomer to championship possi
bilities, upset University of Oregon,
12-7, when Mitchell Frankovich
passed from behind his goal line to
Raymond Livesay who caught the
ball on his 31-yard line just as the
final gun sounded, and raced the re
maining 69 yards to a touchdown.
It was a Frank Merriwell finish to
a nip-and-tuck game.
Yale's "five-game team" continued
its brilliant record by dropping a
7-2 game to Brown University.
Three-fifths of Old Eli's scheduled
games are now completed, but the
New Haven eleven has yet to win
a game. Pittsburgh met unexpected
opposition against Army, winning
18-13, while Pennsylvania surprised
with a 14-7 victory over Dartmouth.
Southern Methodist Comeback
Princeton rose to the heights by
holding Cornell to a scoreless tie.
The myth of Southern Methodist's
weakness was exploded when Syra
cuse fell before the Mustangs, 16-6.
The TexatV teams that Southern
Methodist lost to in early season
games have been just a little
stronger than the Mustangs, and a
great deal stronger than the average
run of big-time football teams.
Notre Dame continued to run wild
over Midwest opposition, swamping
Drake, a fairly strong team, under
ten touchdowns and sixty-two
points. The Ramblers now have a
season record of 264-0.
Vanderbilt, Tulane Tie
Michigan's 14-0 victory over Ohio
State kept the Wolverines very much
in the Big Ten and national cham
pionship races. Purdue, Northwest
ern, Indiana, and Minnesota were
victors in other Big Ten games.
The most important game of the
day brought together Vanderbilt
and Tulane, the South's strongest
teams, who battled evenly for sixty
minutes of hectic football. The score
was 6-6, while Tennessee (7-2 over
Alabama), Texas, Rice, and Virginia
Poly remained in the running for
titular honors.

over the West Coast Army, U.S.C.'s
Trojans met a tartar in little Loyola,

At Portland, U.C.L.A., the latest
newcomer to championship possi
bilities, upset University of Oregon,

The myth of Southern Methodist's
weakness was exploded when Syra
cuse fell before the Mustangs, 16-6.

ern, Indiana, and Minnesota were
victors in other Big Ten games.

day brought together Vanderbilt
and Tulane, the South's strongest
teams, who battled evenly for sixty
minutes of hectic football. The score

Alabama), Texas, Rice, and Virginia
Poly remained in the running for
titular honors.
There were upsets a-plenty on
the gridirons of "these United
States" Saturday afternoon, with
the most serious jolts to alumni
pride fairly evenly divided between
the Atlantic Seaboard and the Pa
cific Coast. Midwestern and South
ern teams played true to form.
Washington State's 7-2 victory
over the California Golden Bears
eliminated Bill Ingram's team from
