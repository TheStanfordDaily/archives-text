# SIXTEEN MEN HURT IN WILD TUMBLE DOWN SIPHON
## 
### 

Workmen cleaning a steeply inclined steel aqueduct of the Los Angeles water system were injures
when they slipped and skidded at an estimated 100 miles an hour to the end of the grade. Sharp toola
formed a part of the mad avalanche that carried the men 900 feet in the inky blackness of the siphon.
