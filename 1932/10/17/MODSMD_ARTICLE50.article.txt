# Roberts, Kagan Take To The Air
## 
### 
Two more children from the
Farm take the air. Last Friday
night Nancy Roberts and Ben
Kagan, both prominent in cam
pus dramatics, were radioed
over station KFRC on the
Happy-Go-Lucky hour. Their
portion of the program score
was a burlesquing skit of a
young couple smitten by Dan
Cupid.
Nancy Roberts figured in
numerous productions at Mills
and Stanford while Ben Kagan,
although an actor, is best
knbwn for his musical-comedy
success. "Two's Company," pro
duced for the Junior Opera
last spring.
