# S.F.U. SURPRISES; HOLDS ST. MARY'S TO 16 TO 7 SCORE
## Gaels Tally 2 Touchdowns, Safety To Win 
### 
Thrilling a crowd of 35,000 who
cume to see slaughter and instead
saw a football game, St. Mary's de- j
feated Spud Lewis' San Francisco
Dons 16 to 7 yesterday afternoon.
The expected rout at Kezar Stadium
became a real battle as the Dons
held the Moragan second team
throughout the first quarter but
were forced to give up a touchdown |
and safety to Madigan's regulars in
the second period.
St. Mary's scored again near the
end of the game, due largely to a
60-yard run by Nichelini. The lone
S.F.U. tally came when Olsen, a
substitute halfback, intercepted a
pass and carried the ball to the
three-yard line, from where the
Dons pushed it over.
