## 
### 
EAST LANSING, Mich., Oct. 16â€”
Surpassing all antiquated traditions,
the Student Council of the Michigan
State College elected to retain only
five of the necessary rules for col
lege life.
The traditions retained are the
forbidding of smoking on certain
positions of the campus, a demo
cratic student body; the wearing of
green hats by freshmen; and pro
hibitions of cutting across the lawns
or defacing college property.
Bakers of Houston, Tex., donated
more than 220,000 loaves of bread to
the unemployed last winter.
