# Hulme Speaks Tomorrow On European Trip
## "Wandering In France" Is Lecture Topic 
### 
I
Edward Maselin Hulme, Stanford
professor of European history, who
spent the spring and summer quar
ters touring France by auto, will
speak tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall.
With "Wandering in France" as
his subject, Hulme will tell his im
pressions of the country after his
sixth visit to Europe.
The professor found France in a
prosperous condition. Despite the
world wide depression, new build
ings are everywhere in evidence.
There are some breadlines, but such
ominous signs are not nearly so
numerous as in America.
Student life at the Sorbonne,
where Hulme once studied, is radi
cally different from that at Stan
ford. A campus, sororities, fraterni
ties, dances, and extra-curricular
activities are unknown.
On the other hand, students have
far greater liberty. They live where
they want and how they want. "A
Dean of Men or Women would find
himself among the French unem
ployed."
Roll is never taken in classes. In
the liberal arts there are no exami
nations except the finals. Examina
tion grades are merely "pass" or
"fail."
Professor Hulme finds that Paris
ians do not patronize Paris night
clubs. "Paris night-life," he says, "is
mainly for tourists. Such districts
as the Mont Parnasse and the Mont
marte are entirely populated by
foreigners. To find the native life
of Paris one must go to the older
districts where the stately mansions
are now occupied by workers."
During his stay in France, Dr.
Hulme found no drunkeness. He be
lieves that "good wines at reason
able prices make for real temper- |
ance by taking away the desire for !
stronger liquors."
