# GERMANY ASKS MART TO MAKE DEBT PAYMENT
## Von Papen Asks Nations To Open Frontiers To Prussian Goods

BERLIN, Oct. 16 (/P) —A com
paratively long spell of political
tranquility was broken in Ger
many today by fighting which
resulted in two deaths, fifteen
serious injuries, and twenty-five
arrests.

PADERBORN, Germany. Oct. 16
(Pt 3 ) — Outlining Germany's program
for the forthcoming world economic
conference, Chancellor Franz von
Papen asserted today creditor na
tions could only reckon upon pay
ment of Germany's foreign debts if
they were prepared to accept Ger
man goods as payment.
This meant, he added, creditor na
tions must open their frontiers to
German goods. He said it would be
illogical to expect repayment and at
the same time close frontiers against
German goods.
"Must Have Markets"
Asserting Germany could not at
present bear another drain of
moneys withdrawn by foreign cred
itors, he said: "Foreign creditors
must be expected to go beyond a
standstill agreement and consolidate
money lent to Germany. We will
emphasize what is being realized by
creditor nations more today than
ever—that the debtor can only ful
fill his obligations by payment in
goods.
"Germany's foreign indebtedness
of 20,000,000,000 marks (about $4,-
600,000,000) would only be an un
bearable burden no longer if foreign
frontiers were free and insuperable
hindrances no longer were placed
on German goods in the world mar
ket."
The imperial conference at Ot
tawa, the Chancellor asserted, failed
to revive confidence that economic
barriers will be lifted.
Asks Equal Armaments
On the subject of disarmament,
he asserted "Germany's aim is not
to arm up to her neighbors' levels
but to procure world disarmament
with equal security and justice..
There must not be a system of
hegemony or political alliances in
Europe, but one by which nations
can serve humanity in mutual re
spect of their individualism."
