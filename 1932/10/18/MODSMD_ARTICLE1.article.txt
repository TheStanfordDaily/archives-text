# FINAL SALE OF U. C. ROOTERS' TICKETS TODAY
## Urge Early Purchases To Avoid Expected Rush Among Students DEADLINE AT 5 O'CLOCK Student Body Cards Must Be Shown In Person 
### 
The two-day sale for rooters
tickets to the Stanford-California
football battle at Berkeley, Novem
ber 19, will close at 5 o'clock this
afternoon, and no more ducats will
be sold after that time, according to
Alfred R. Masters, manager of the
Board of Athletic Control.
With 700 out some 2400 available
tickets claimed, salesmen in the As
sociated Students' office in the Old
Union anticipate a big rush today
and urge all who are able to buy
their tickets this morning. The main
bulk of the remaining pasteboards
will probably be sold after lunch,
the office announced, and less con
fusion will result if more students
will call early.
Cards Required
Tickets sell for $1.65. Students
must call in person and present their
student body cards. In case any
body is unable to appear in person,
he should send his student body
card and the money in a sealed en
velope, with his name and address
written on the outside. The ticket
will be held for him at the Board of
Athletic Control offices as long as
necessary.
Members of the Rally Committee
last night expressed confidence that
Stanford men and women would see
their way clear to give Coach Pop
Warner's men united backing at the
game.
No Late Requests
All tickets not sold today will be
returned to Berkeley for distribu
tion to alumni and other applicants,
Masters said. They must be sent
back at once in order to get them
prepared for mailing on .schedule, he
added, and no late requests can be
honored.
The same system that has been
in use for several years will be
employed to seat the rooters. The
section will be filled in from the
top down, as rooters arrive. Al
though the tickets have assigned
seat numbers, they will be disre
garded.
