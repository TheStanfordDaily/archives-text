### 
Experiences and impressions got
ten while traveling through France
will be related by Dr. Edward Mas
lin Hulme, professor of European
History, when he speaks tonight at

Dr. Hulme has recently returned
from a five months' tour of France
where he made special efforts to
visit the French countryside and
those places which are passed over
by the average tourist.
Country Contented
The general air of the country he
found to be one of contentment,
with simple and inexpesive pleas
ures. "The masses seem content to
follow along in their ancestral ways,
undisturbed . by any overreaching
ambitions."
In Vezelay Dr. Hulme saw the
place where Bernard of Clairvaux
preache dthe impetus for the Sec
ond Crusade. From the Romanesque
abbey church there he went to
Semur. All of the provinces, Dr.
Hulme found, have an individual
beauty and interest.
No European Drunks
He felt that Paris is unfriendly to
Americans, although this attitude
varies with special cases. Along the
beaten track are the grasping hotels
which delight in "milking" tourists,
with a trend toward standard prices
in stores, cafes, and other hotels.

Hulme commented that 'Euro
peans do not get drunk." The pro
fessor believes that good wines at
moderate prices promote temper
ance and not drunkenness.
