# A.W.S. No-Smoking Recommendation Is Not Edictâ€”Morris
## "House Presidents Went Beyond Authority," States Reply

"The A.W.S. Conference recom
mendation against women smoking
in the rooting section was not
passed as legislation. There is no
intention of enacting any future
legislation on the matter.
"In passing this recommendation
the house presidents were not act
ing with the authority of the groups
they represent.
"Under NO condition will those
who do not follow the recommenda
tion be called before the Women's
Council."
A.W.S. Stand Plain
Thus clearly and concisely did
Mary-Katherine Morris, president
of the Associated Women Students,
make plain the stand of the A.W.S.
administrators on the question of
public smoking in the stands of the
Stadium. Her statement came as a
climax to a whirlwind of discussion
that swept through the hall and
the row yesterday after the an
nouncement of the action the Con
ference had taken.
To begin the affair the A.W.S.
Conference, which includes house
presidents and members of Women's
Council, voted unanimously, with
the approval of Dean Mary Yost, to
recommend that Stanford women
refrain from smoking in the Sta
dium stands.
Women Ask Action
Then, assuming that the action
was intended to be regulatory, a
number of women took up the fight
for the preservation of women's
rights, asking their houses to re
verse the decisions of their repre
sentatives, and to leave the matter
of smoking in the hands of the
groups or individuals, where, they
declared, it pioperly belongs.
The house presidents who voted
on the measure, it developed, were
officially voicing only their own
personal opinions, without previous
instruction from their constituents
and without privilege or intention of
resubmission to the living groups.
The action will be considered
nothing more important than a
recommendation, as the foregoing
statement makes clear.
There is no regulation on the
books preventing Stanford women
from exercising the smoking privi
lege in public on any occasion at
any time if they so desire.
