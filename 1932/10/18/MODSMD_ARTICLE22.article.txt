### 
STOCKHOLM, Oct. 17 (/P)—'"The
Green Pastures," Pulitzer prize win
ning play which has been running
in the United States so long few
can remember when it opened, was
played under police guard here to
day after the actors were made vic
tims of an egg barrage last night.
The eggs, which were accompanied
by decayed tomatoes, stench bombs,
and other uncomplimentary projec
tiles, were thrown by a small group
in the audience who said they ob
jected to the show as "religious
lampoonery."
