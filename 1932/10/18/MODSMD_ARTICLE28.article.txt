## Chicago Authorities Hold Report Untrue 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 17 (/P>—'The
State's Attorney's office tonight
denied knowledge of a reputed
conspiracy planned to kidnap
Samuel Insuil from Athens.
"Such a procedure wouldn't
he considered," W. A. Ritten
house, Assistant States's Attor
ney, said.

ATHENS, Greece, Oct. 17. (/P) —
. Samuel Insull, wanted in Chicago
. on charges of grand larceny and
• embezzlement in connection with i
the downfall of his utilities inter- ;
ests, called newspaper corresopnd
; ents today and said he had been
, warned of a plot by Chicago au- i
'; thorities to kidnap him.
, j The warning, he said, came to him |
|! in a telegram. He declared he con
sidered the entire affair "absolutely i
preposterous," but explained that |
he could not afford to ignore it in j
his present situation.
Story "Absurd"
At the American Legation the j
kidnap .story was characterized as j
absurd, and assurances were given j
that the United States would take
no improper action, in dealing with ;
the Insull case.
Greek authorities, confident Amer- ;
ican officials would not stoop toj
gangster methods, affirmed that In- ;
sull would have full protection.
According to Insull's version, the j
, plan was to get him away from |
1 Athens to a country "more favor- j
able" to the designs of the kidnap- ,
| pers. The fact that the formalities
I in connection with the Greco-Amer- !
ican extradition treaty have not ]
| been completed has hampered j
American attempts to get him back j
to Chicago.
Telegram Revealed
, The utilities man gave out a j
| statement which follows, in part:
"I have just been at the Police
Department and have notified them
of the receipt of this telegram:
"''Have reliable advice Chicago
authorities hired four Greek detec- \
, tives in America to send to Athens |
i to kidnap you and remove you to a j
country more favorable to their |
ends. The four have not left Amer- j
ica yet, but Chicago believe authori- j
ties there may try to arrange for j
other residents to do this job. Chi- 1
cago says this report to be con- !
! firmed or otherwise tomorrow.' "
