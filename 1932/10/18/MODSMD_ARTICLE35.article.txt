# TO SHE WHO LAUGHS THIS MORNING

### 
Editorial sagacity received a staggering blow lasl night
when Pan-Hellenic passed a group of new rushing rules,
against (lie advices of the Daily. Last week this column
commented upon the absurdity of these same proposed
regulations, pointing out that their passing may threaten
the entire women's rushing system. The sad experience of
lasl year's fraternity rushing, caused by just such petty
over-legislation, was recalled.
Pan-Ilellenic is most likely laughing at the Daily this
morning, laughing at its attempt to lead opinion among
the Five Hundred. Which reminds us of an old adage
Furthermore, the Duly has long since realized the futility
of attempting to lead Stanford women. Hut you can't
blame the editorial us for commenting once in a while
upon the wcirdness of their antics.
