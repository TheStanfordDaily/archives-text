A lecture as certain to be charming and interesting as
it is to be utterly informal will be given by Professor
Kdwin Maslin llulme of the Department of History at 7:>
o'clock tonight in the Assembly Hall.
Professor Hulme is a world's authority on modern and
medieval European history, a man of highest culture and a
fascinating speaker. He has just returned from his sixth
visit to the Continent, after spending the spring and sum
mer touring France by auto, and he is prepared to give his
Stanford audience bis impressions in the original style so
tamiliar to the students who crowd into his courses everv
quarter.
Having spent part of his student days at the Sorbonne
and other European schools, Hulme is able to present
the undergraduate's observations as well as the professor's,
lie is well worth two hours or three of the busiest man's
time and his talk tonight will last only an hour.
