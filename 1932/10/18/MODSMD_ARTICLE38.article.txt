# MECHANICAL SHORT CUT
## 
### 
Dr. Robert M. Hutchins, President of Hie University of
Chicago and sponsor of innovations in I lie edneational
work, has announced the production of a series of talking
pictures to he used in class room and lecture hall. Work
on the films will begin shortly and they will be tried out on
the freshmen next fall.
There is little likelihood that the silver screen will sup
plant the professor in the college lecture hall. Talking pic
tures, if they are used at all, will be merely supplementary
aids to teaching. In the smaller colleges and secondary
schools they can compensate for almost inevitable de
ficiencies in technical equipment and teaching ability and
in the larger institutions they can at least act as a short cut
through much of the routine work. If these films arc in
telligently produced and judiciously employed there is no
reason why they should not lake their place on the campus
along with the typewriter and the slide rule as another
machine age contribution to the business of education.

Any excuse which will condone the absence of any
member of the editorial staff from today's meeting will
have to be a verv good excuse indeed.
