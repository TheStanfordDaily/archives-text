# BULL SESSION
## OKAY RALLY COMMITTEE 
### 
Okay Rally Committee. On with
the dance.
During the autumn season, par
ticularly, many students are much
imbued with this University where
the color of life is red. These people
are very much afraid that the red
may become bleached to a mild
pmk—and that would mean that the
much-vaunted virility of this cam
pus was in the descendancy. There
fore, it was only natural that some
students should take exception to
the Rally Committee's plan to have
r c jolly-up after the U.S.C. Rally.
The criticism is well established
on two fairly evident fallacies. First,
is that somehow, dancing is an ef
feminite sport—when of course, in
reality about half the people who
dance are men. When we were
about twelve, and just acquiring
male ego, when sissy was the worst
possible offense to God, country,
and home—then it was that dancing
was loathed as something unworthy
of a MAN'S time. Most men lost
that idea.
Of course, as soon as one con
cedes that there is nothing particu
larly damnable in dancing—nothing
especially indicative of acute ane
mia—then the Rally Committee idea
seems fairly acceptable. There is ab
solutely nothing antithetical to
yelling for raw Trojan meat at 7:15;
and gamboling .over the hardwood
half an hour later. Both are typical
and natural reactions of college men.
The second misconception on
which one can base one's grum
blings because the Rally Committee
is "spiking" the U.S.C. Rally with
one part "jolly-up"—is that a foot
ball rally is something so sacred—
so Stanford, that the act is simply
sacrilegious. And of course, if once
it is possible to bring in the moral
or religious angle, argument ceases
and emotion runs hog wild.

| A rally is not a spontaneous ex-
I pression of uneontainable school
I spirit. People usually go because
j the things are enjoyable; and if the
customary racket can be topped off
with a little social relaxation, the
adulterating of the Rally is most
| pleasing. The majority of the stu
dent-body doesn't sit in the bleach
) ers and cheer through an unyield
-1 ing love to our University. If that
| were the case, we could expect a
| full section for every game. No, the
average student goes to the game
i because he enjoys the spectacle; and
, those that go and are able in addi
| tion to convince themselves that
they are doing a DUTY as well, just
i add that much to their own fun.
And the same with the team.
! Some may fight for the glory of the
! school. But most of them smash the
| line, skirt the end, fall on the ball,
; etc., because they get a great kick
! out of the game. This, coupled with
i the prestige and glory, makes the
i reward complete. The rooting sec
j tion may think they are winning
! the game when they give vent to
j their personal excitement in a great
| skyrocket. Many players have told
jme the racket in the stands does
; nothing but annoy them; and fur
j thermore, some of the team's great
| est performances have been done
j with practically no Stanford people
I present.
The old-timer objects to this in-
I novation of dancing at the rally as
! a great treason to the past tradi
j tions; an da clear indication that the
j men of today ain't what they used
i to be. Yet the real spirit of Stanford
j is not found in a few hoary customs
| about rallies, etc. The spirit of
1 Stanford is bound up in its cultural
liberty expressed in the motto, "The
Winds of Freedom Are Blowing"—
and in our social democracy which
gave birth to the "Stanford rough."

During the autumn season, par

imbued with this University where
the color of life is red. These people
are very much afraid that the red
may become bleached to a mild

much-vaunted virility of this cam
pus was in the descendancy. There
fore, it was only natural that some
students should take exception to
the Rally Committee's plan to have
r c jolly-up after the U.S.C. Rally.
The criticism is well established
on two fairly evident fallacies. First,
is that somehow, dancing is an ef
