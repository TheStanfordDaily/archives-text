LA TOSCA (Puccini). At the
The opening of the new opera
house was celebrated with due
pomp, dress parade, unveiling, and
talk. In order to rise above these;
incidentals the opera had to be good j
—and was. Claudia Muzio in the I
title role gave an intense and con- :
vincing portrayal without falling
back upon the hysterical gyrations |
which Jeritza usually employs.
She took full advantage of the |
fine acoustics of the new house !
which permit the softest notes to :
be heard from any seat, and pro- !
duced most of her emotional effect -
by varying the volume of her voice
rather than by clasping her hands '
to her breast. Her high notes were ]
occasionally too shrill, but this was
more than balanced by remarkable ,
tone quality in the lower ranges.
Dino Borgioli as Mario began en- '
thusiastically gave "Recondita Ar
monia" from the footlights with too j
much force and too many gestures, ;
and remained quiet for the rest of
Ihe scene. His small second act bit j
showed improvement, and in the j
third act he was beyond criticism.
"E lucevan le stelle" was the finest
thing of the evening. His acting,
however, remained mediocre.
Alfredo Gandolfi as Scarpia !
played very quietly, Ihe man in j
complete' control of a situation'
rather than a melodramatic villain, j
The part does not allow display of '
vocal brilliance; he sang with an
effortless voice that was always rich
and pleasing.
Fortunately the three principals
do most of the singing, for the others |
were dull. Marsden Argall failed to
make himself heard above the or- j
chestra (more the orchestra's fault '

than his) and acted poorly. The rest
were adequate.
The new opera house itself was a
pleasant surprise to many who had
feared, judging by the amount spent
on it, that it might be over-magnifi
cent. The interior is done in white
and gold, the decorations pleasing
and not obvious. The dignified sim
plicity of the building will always
continue to please, no matter how
much architectural fashions change.
In a theatre to be used for all sorts
of productions this simplicity is es
pecially desirable, since one would
soon become tired of ornate decor
which detracts from the presenta
tions.
It is claimed that the stage is
equipped with all modern devices;
but the sets used showed no diver
gence from tradition. Painted back
drops, cupids, and rococo decora
tions were much in evidence. The
stage, with the exception of opera,
has been freed from this artificiality
for over thirty years, and there is
no reason why opera should not be
likewise emancipated. —C.A.Z.
