# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Biting sarcasm, when employed
by one with a personal motive in
mind, is often used to clothe other
wise simple and utterly illogical
.statements in the garb of superficial
arguments to temporarily deceive
one who hurriedly glances through
the Campus Opinion column before
eight o'clocks begin.
Yesterday, two such statements
appeared in this column. They
flayed the action of the Rally Com
mittee in proposing to sponsor a
short jolly-up tomorrow night after
the rally for the S.C. game.
In the first place, the jolly-up
would be entirely separate from the
rally, and not a part of it at all.
Which, being the truth, is precisely
the opposite from the idea conveyed
in this column yesterday.
Secondly, there has been no all
campus jolly-up so far this quarter.
Best-Liked Tradition
Thirdly, though perhaps Messrs.
Frank Plummer Barnes and Charles
Harvey Coiner have not heard it
yet, the Stanford jolly-up is one of
the oldest and best-liked traditions
on the campus today. And even to
day, we do not believe that anyone
besides one of these gentlemen

] would ask that a true Stanford
Rough attend such a jolly-up in
formal attire, wit ha corsage for his
i fair partner from the "500."
Mr. Coiner signs himself "Yours
' for a rally, not for a dance" . . .
but what's wrong with being slight
ly original for a change and have
! both and make both a real suc
-1 cess . . . also, for a change.
"Aw, Rats"
Frank Mr. Barnes, who shouts
1 derisively "Aw, Rats!" at the idea
! and advocates (oh, yes, he might
i have been subtly sarcastic) that the
i roughs go to the jolly-ups in the
; future in tuxedos, probably forgets
j that two things can exist at the
j same time . . . even without getting
stuck in the same rut in that fa
mous of famed placesâ€”the one
track mind.
Popular opinion o the campus de
| cidedly favors such a jolly-up to
morrow evening as planned by the
Rally Committee. Why should we
; be misled by two roughie-toughies
whose sole perverted idea of college
life would abolish the jolly-up where
I the real Rough is King for an hour?
Let's have that jolly-up tomorrow
night! How about it, Mr. Corbus and
the Ex Committee?
