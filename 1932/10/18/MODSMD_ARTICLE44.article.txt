The market moved lower yester
day, the Daily average closing at
66.05 down 2.10 from Saturday.
I may point out that the present
market obviously disregards indi
vidual stocks and even individual
industries. The trend of all times
is strictly in accordance with the
general market outlook. Thus, with
in the last few months, there was a
prolonged rally and rise in railroad
securities though most of the roads
were consulting the local witch doc
tor as to where bond interest was
to come from. The motors, • espe
cially Chrysler and General, shot
up from 3UO to 400% above their
lows while their distributors had
given up even relatives as a source
of sale. There remains considerable
uncertainty as to the $1 dividend
now paid by General Motors. With
steel companies the case is identical.
U.S. Steel doubled in value in a
time when its ticker quotation "X"
returned to all its former question
able meaning; the plant was oper
ating at about 15% capacity while
executives and speculators alike
cursed the memory of the old man
who once blessed the public with
the counsel that Steel and Liberty
bonds slept in the same bed.
There are certain companies today
making good money. I list among
others American Tobacco, Reynolds,
United Aircraft, most of the food
stocks, and some of the better utili
ties. Yet these issues fluctuate along
v/ith such choice babies as Case,
Auburn, Cities Service, and Stand
ard Gas. These sort of indiscrimin
ate monkeyshines have been going
on now for about 5 years. It was,
apparently, according to the scheme
of things that, on the up or down,
American Telephone should be es
