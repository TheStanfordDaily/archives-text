# Trojan Line Looms Strongest In Coach Jones' Time
## U.S.C. FORWARD WALL SHOWS UP BETTER THAN EVER Youell, Jorgenson, Good On Defense, Passes; Other Pairs Show Force 
### 
THE TROJAN LINE!
Hard-boiled coaches grew weak
kneed, and rival centers, guards,
tackles, and ends up and down the
Pacific Coast clench thuir fists
bravely when they hear those words.
Back in 1924 and 1925 whf*n Notre
Dame's backfield was dazzling op
posing defenses with its sweep and
deception, the four South Bend
runners were dubbed "The Four
Horsemen." Southern California's
line has been so good during the
last three years, that comparison by
literary allusion has never been
pushed beyond that one phrase:
THE TROJAN LINE.
Centers "Weak"
U.S.C.'s 1932 forward wall is the
strongest in the history of the Jones
regime.
There are two great centers work
ing out on Bovard Field: Curt
Youell and Hal Jorgenson, and yet
they are the weakest men in the
Trojan line. Jorgenson is a bear on
defense, wh'le Youell is one of the
best passers on the Coast.
Larry Stevens (brother of Stan
ford's fullback) and Aaron Rosen
berg are bruising guards weighing
210 pounds. Rosenberg is the run
ning guard . . . the first man to clip
opposing ends as they charge in.
Brown Punt-Blocker
There are many great pairs of
tackles this year, but few combina
tions match Captain Tay Brown and
Ernie Smith for power and experi
ence. Brown is the boy who breaks
through to block punts and smear
interference before it is under way,
while Smith strengthens the right
side of the line between place
kicking conversions and attempting
field goals. A1 Coughlin and George
Lady, a vicious 230-pounder, are the
reserve tackles, while Heuston Har
per and Francis McGinley, sopho
mores, are guard substitutes.
The Stanford ends, Doub, Colvin,
and Tod are among the best, but
have not yet shown the form of
Troy's Ray Sparling and Ford
Palmer, Bill Bescos and Ward
Browning (190 pounds) will be
waiting to go in.
Regular Form Expected
Up till last Saturday the Trojan
line has been inclined to take life a
bit easy, but they received such a
beating at the hands of the Loyola
forwards that they will probably
play up their true form for the rest
of the season . . . particularly next
Saturday afternoon in the Stanford
Stadium.

last three years, that comparison by
literary allusion has never been
pushed beyond that one phrase:
THE TROJAN LINE.
Centers "Weak"
U.S.C.'s 1932 forward wall is the
strongest in the history of the Jones
regime.
There are two great centers work
ing out on Bovard Field: Curt
Youell and Hal Jorgenson, and yet
they are the weakest men in the
Trojan line. Jorgenson is a bear on
defense, wh'le Youell is one of the
best passers on the Coast.
Larry Stevens (brother of Stan
ford's fullback) and Aaron Rosen
berg are bruising guards weighing
210 pounds. Rosenberg is the run
ning guard . . . the first man to clip
opposing ends as they charge in.
Brown Punt-Blocker
There are many great pairs of
tackles this year, but few combina
tions match Captain Tay Brown and
Ernie Smith for power and experi
ence. Brown is the boy who breaks
through to block punts and smear
interference before it is under way,
while Smith strengthens the right
side of the line between place
kicking conversions and attempting
field goals. A1 Coughlin and George
Lady, a vicious 230-pounder, are the
reserve tackles, while Heuston Har
per and Francis McGinley, sopho
mores, are guard substitutes.
The Stanford ends, Doub, Colvin,
and Tod are among the best, but
have not yet shown the form of
Troy's Ray Sparling and Ford
Palmer, Bill Bescos and Ward
Browning (190 pounds) will be
waiting to go in.
Regular Form Expected
Up till last Saturday the Trojan
line has been inclined to take life a
bit easy, but they received such a
beating at the hands of the Loyola
forwards that they will probably
play up their true form for the rest
of the season . . . particularly next
Saturday afternoon in the Stanford
Stadium.
THE TROJAN LINE!
Hard-boiled coaches grew weak
kneed, and rival centers, guards,
tackles, and ends up and down the
Pacific Coast clench thuir fists
bravely when they hear those words.
Back in 1924 and 1925 whf*n Notre
Dame's backfield was dazzling op
posing defenses with its sweep and
deception, the four South Bend
runners were dubbed "The Four
Horsemen." Southern California's
line has been so good during the
last three years, that comparison by
literary allusion has never been
pushed beyond that one phrase:
