# Grays Drill Trojan Plays
## 
### 
With no scrimmages against out
side teams scheduled for this week,
ihe Stanford Grays will spend their
time helping the varsity to prepare
for Saturday's classic with S.C. The
work with the varsity will take the
form of dummy scrimmages in
which the Grays will use a number
of Trojan formations which they
have been perfecting during the
past week.

Last night's practice consisted of
j signal drill followed by a half hour's
; line scrimmage under Ernie Nevers.
j Coach Cuddeback spent the session
i drilling a team in a series of S.C.
I plays.
