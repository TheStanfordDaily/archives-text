# BUILD SET FOR "DEATH HOLIDAY"
## Stover Designs Scenes For Next Campus Drama 
### 
Working together to produce a
symphony of color and motion,
Harold Helvenston and Fred Stover
are again teamed in the preparation
of a Stanford play, this time "Death
Takes A Holiday," to be produced
in the University Assembly Hall on
October 82.
Although the play is essentially
that of the director, the set is of
signal importance, because of the
unity of place. Stover has completed
the design for this set, and construc
tion by competent artists is now un
der way.
The entire, exciting action of the
drama takes place in a single scene
—a characteristic rare in recent
plays. The place is the great hall
of the Italian castle of Duke Lam
bert de Catolica.
Stover's set serves to emphasize
the power of the drama enacted
thereon. It is a high-ceilinged room,
in the rear of which is an opening
onto a loggia, through which are
seen tall populars and an artistic
garden. The set is constructed to
emphasize the tremendous growth
of floral life which takes place dur
ing Death's holiday.
