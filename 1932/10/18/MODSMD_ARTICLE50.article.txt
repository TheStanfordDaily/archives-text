| PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT
' STANFORD has nothing to do to
i gain national recognition but beat
I the seemingly Thunderless Herd,
| may be in for a painful surprise
j when the Indians come up against
! Bill Spaulding's overgrown Bears,
better known as Bruins.
The Westwood coach has been
doing very little talking and a great
deal of work. He has admitted that
he had some quarterbacks who knew
their stuff, and that he had a line
that would be good enough to leave
I a few regulars on the bench when
things got tough, but he hasn't said
that he was going to beat anybody.
Now, after Oregon has beaten a
fine Santa Clara outfit, Spaulding
unlocks his animal cage and brings
out boys who wait until the final
gun goes off to throw, catch, and
run with a pass that is good for a
victory over Prink Callison's Web
feet. Even though Oregon's prize
! fullback, Mike Mikulak, was injured
the Bruins must be credited with
playing come-through football. AND
THAT, after all, is the kind that
wins games.
Stanford will have its hands full
! with the Trojans this week (don't
I let any of these 2-1 boys mislead
■ you!!) and the following Saturday
i the warriors go south to rout out
! Bruin in his own lair. If Southern
California happens to emerge on
the top side of the score it will take
the entire squad to subdue Spauld
ing this year. Don't forget that the
Westwood aggregation is laying for
j Stanford. It is still burned over the
j way we squeaked out a victory last
j year on that famous Allen-to-Col
! vin pass in the closing minutes of
i P^y.
<®> <* <?>
IT IS BAD ENOUGH to have an
official pull a boner at any time,
j but if Field Judge Arthur Badenoch
pulled as obvious an error as he has
! been credited with to give S.C. its
j six-point margin over little Loyola
I University last Saturday, it looks
as if he has worked about all the
! games that are coming to him.
You can't make perfectly visible
mistakes at crucial moments and
stay in the officiating business. It
i doesn't help the game. It doesn't
| help you. AND it makes for a lot
:of bad feeling that the game cart
I bet along without beautifully.

THOSE WHO HAVE SQUAWKED
over Stanford's football team and
been rewarded, will appreciate fully
the sentiments of the Yale Alumni
when they begin to sound the horn
for retrenchment at the end of the
present season.
Yale's alumni are a potent factor
in the stability of Yale, and they

were not at all happy at the pros
! pect of a five-game schedule for
| this year anyway, but when the old
i blue turns up with a tattered record
i of two ties and three defeats listen
to 'em howl. The Blue-Crimson
battle this year is going to be all
1 Crimson unless Yale shows more
than it has so far.
Intramural sports are great for
I (hose who like them and can't get
on the varsity, but don't try to
dump the tradition of years into the
basket in one kick and substitute
; mural battles for good old varsity
squabbles with the boys from Bos
ton 'cause it won't woi'k!!

IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR Sun
days are dragging, get out the old
chart book and the daily paper and
follow the progress of the Pittsburgh
Panthers.
They gave a convincing lesson to
the Army team that should slaugh
ter Yale this next week-end. They
have a tough schedule ahead. AND
one of the toughest that they expect
to meet is none other than the Red
Machine from Palo Alto.
So keep your eye on them and
let's see if they are better on their
home lot than they were in Pasa

dump the tradition of years into the
basket in one kick and substitute
; mural battles for good old varsity
squabbles with the boys from Bos
ton 'cause it won't woi'k!!

IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR Sun
days are dragging, get out the old
chart book and the daily paper and
follow the progress of the Pittsburgh
Panthers.
They gave a convincing lesson to
the Army team that should slaugh
ter Yale this next week-end. They
have a tough schedule ahead. AND
one of the toughest that they expect
to meet is none other than the Red
Machine from Palo Alto.
So keep your eye on them and
let's see if they are better on their
home lot than they were in Pasa
dena one New Year's Day game we
can recall. R.D.W.Jr.
