teams from up the Row took two of
the three scheduled grid games
Sigma Chi defeated the hall men
from Sequoia II 13-7, Alpha Kappa
Lambda came from behind in the
second half to win a 6-2 game from
El Tigre and the El Cuadro squad
ended up with the only Hall victory
with a 18-0 triumph over the Chi
Psi's.
Russ Saunders, on a 20-yard pass
from P. Palmer, chalked up the first
six points for Sigma Chi in the first
half of the game against Sequoia.
The try for point failed. In the last
few minutes of play P. Palmer car
ried the ball and tallied the second
touchdown. He brought the total
points for Sigma Chi to 13 when
he converted successfully. Retaliat
ing in the last two minutes of play,
Bill Wagnon tallied a touchdown for
the men from Sequoia. Bill Ladue
converted for the extra point.
Returning a punt in the second
half behind good interference, Dick
Thorup of A.K.L. ran GO yards to a
touchdown to score the lone tally
for the Row men against El Tigre.
On the opening kick-off Thorup,
safety man, touched the ball in front
of his goal line. The ball bounded
over the zone where it was downed
by an El Tigre man to account for
the clubmen's two points. Doug
Holcomb played an outstanding
game for Tigre in the backfield,
while Maddy Jones took the honors
in the line.
Piling up the greatest number of
points of any team during the day's
games, El Cuadro outplayed the men
from Chi Psi during both halves. A
20-yard pass from Ed Saunders to
Schmidt and a 10-yard run brought
the first touchdown for Cuadro in
the first half. Intercepting a Chi
Psi pass on the opponent's 20-yard
line, Schmidt again took touchdown
honors and tallied another six points
for dear old Cuadro. Saunders
boomed through the line of scrim
mage in the second half and sprint
ed 20 yards for the third club
touchdown.
