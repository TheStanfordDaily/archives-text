# RICE INSTITUTE, FOR FIRST TIME, LOOMS AS CANDIDATE FOR NATIONAL GRID TITLE
## 
### 
Led by a great halfback in Jack
! Thrasher and a great coach in Jake
i Meagher, a Notre Dame man, a new
j national football power has risen
out of the dregs of Southwest Con
; ference competition ... Rice Insti
! tute of Houston, Texas.
For many years the gridiron his
tory of the Rice Owls consisted of
| one bad beating after another . . .
Texas, Tulane, Texas Christian,
| Southern Methodist, Arkansas. Back
in 1923 Rice upset Texas Aggies, in
j 1927 the Owls nosed out Arkansas,
| 13-9. These were the high spots of
Rice's history until the Meagher
regime began began two years ago.
In 1930 and 1931 Rice won her "Big
Game" from Texas by small mar
gins. On both occasions, the Long
i horns had been heavy favorites to
| win. Last year Rice entered inter
| sectional competition, winning from
| Arizona, lowa State, and Loyola.
1932 Opens Week
The 1932 Rice season has opened
i auspiciously. Texas Arts and Indus
! tries was swamped by a big score,
| Biff Jones' strong Louisiana State
I Tigers were beaten, and Southern
I Methodists' Mustangs were defeated,
I 13-0, for the first time in many
| years. Last Saturday Rice's second
I string battered out a 14-7 victory

| over Loyola of New Orleans.
The Southwest Conference cham
! pionship this season is in the hands
! of Pice, Texas University, and Texas
' Christian. All three have rather in-
| secure holds on title rights, but the
! situation will be considerably clari
| fied Saturday afternoon when Rice
! tangles with Texas University, while
! Texas Christian is taking a "brealh
j er" against Austin College.
Texas Strong
Texas has shown tremendous
scoring power this fall: 65-0 over
Missouri, and 17-10 over Oklahoma,
a very strong team. The Rice and
j Texas lines are on a par, but Rice,
with Thrasher, Wallace, and Dris
coll in her backfield, has a slight
edge in offensive strength.
Our guess is that Rice will win
j Saturday, and go on to win her first
i Southwest Conference title by de
j feating Texas Christian. Rice had a
I post-season game scheduled with
Santa Clara ,to be played in San
| Francisco, but the St. Mary's-Ala

bama game yould have come so soon
after the Rice-Bronco clash that
graduate managers of the two
schools decidcd the game was un
wise.
