# CARD LINESMEN OUTWEIGHED BY U.S.C. "BEEF TRUST"; MAY OUTSTRIP TROJANS
## 
### BOB LETTS 
Frequently during the West Coast
A.rmy game here last Saturday, fans
saw Kenny Afflerbaugh, Buck Van
Dellen, Chuck White, or Jay Stevens
bang through the line for good
yardage. No doubt it was partly due
to their ability, but there had to be
some kind of an opening created by
the men in the forward wall.
The opening was there, almost
without fail, and the bulk of the
work fell on the shoulders of the
tackles—particularly the Stanford
left tackles—Ben Palamountain and
Chuck Prelsnik.
See Hope in Grey
When you figure that George Grey
is the Number 1 man in that posi
tion and has such capable substi
tutes, you can see where Stanford's
offensive possibilities present them
selves for this week's big struggle
with the University of Southern
California.
Against big Ernie Smith of U.S.C.,
these boys will have their hands
full.
Laborde Still Doubtful
Right tackle presents more of a
problem to Pop Warner, since he is
still uncertain of Here Laborde, who
has been vaulting around on crufrch-

les for two weeks. At present, it
looks like Red Gribben or Chuck
Rogers. Both should see action. They 1
will oppose Captain Tay Brown of
I the Trojans, who is the big shot of |
the southern line.
The U.S.C. Beef Trust dominates
i the center and guard positions, with j
Aaron Rosenberg, Larry Stevens,
and probably Curt Youell starting. j
They will outweigh Stanford's trio i
by 15 pounds, roughly, on the aver- j
I age. So will Bill Corbus, the right
i guard, and his fiery substitute, Red !
Targhetta. Ted Kite, left guard, is j
I no babe in arms. Bob O'Connor and !
1 Johnston will lend their weight to '
| the situation nicely.
Card Ends Best
Stanford will have a big edge at 1
the ends. Ray Sparling of U.S.C. is
good—but Jay Tod, Don Colvin and
Bill Doub are better. Tod and Col
vin are fast, can catch passes, and i
| raise (...) with opposing tackles, j
1 ends and halves. Carlos Monsalve j
J and Thorny Rogers are good enough ,
to rattle El Trojan's teeth, even !
though Jones has Bescos, Seixas, ,
Browning, and Norris.
So much for the linemen. The i
, backs tomorrow.
