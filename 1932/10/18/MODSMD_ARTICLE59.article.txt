# Maloney Drills Soccer Squad
## Regulars Are Prepared For U.S.F. Game 
### 
Shifting those of his regulars who
had not gone horseback riding over
the week-end around in an attempt
to find a combination that would
click, Coach Harry Maloney put his
varsity soccer squad through over
an hour's drill yesterday. The team,
still undefeated, will meet the
eleven artistic kickers from S.F.U.
Saturday in one of the season s most
important games.
The Dons have a 13 to 0 mathe
matical edge on the Cards. Stanford
defeated San Jose 2 to 1 and then
enjtyed the sensation of reading
that S.F.U. had taken the Teachers
for an 11 to 0 ride. And the Sail
Francisco boys scored three goals
against San Mateo J.C. while the
best Stanford could obtain was a
2-2 tie.
Led by Art Hearn, the first team
scored four times against the sec
ond-stringers in spite of the excel
lent soccer played by Johnny
Hitchcock at right half for the "al
most regulars." McShea also looked
good for the boys in white shirts.
Maloney opened the session with
a talk on the Stanford mistakes in
the San Mateo game, and then sent
his booters around the field in a
"wind sprint" that winded most of
the squad.
