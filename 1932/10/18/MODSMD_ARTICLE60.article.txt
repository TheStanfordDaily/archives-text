# Stanford Grad In Opera Tells Stage Success
## Argall Opens S.P. Season With First Song 
### Rolph Malloch 
Awaiting the magic cry of "Cur- j
tain!" backstage on the opening
night of San Francisco s new opera
house, Marsden Argall, '24, had time
to explain the intricacies of his i
dressing room and to say something 1
for Daily readers.
While the orchestra was softly I
tuning down in the pit, and the i
flashy audience of great and near- I
great was noisily and excitedly fiil- j
ing the auditorium, backstage there j
was a remarkable lack of hurry and i
bustle. Like clockwork was the quiet j
efficiency of the stage crew; like i
stock players doing Abie's Irish Rose j
for the 20th time was the caliji of i
the principals.

1924—Debut on the Stanford cam
pus.
1932 —An outstanding baritone, a
success on stage, screen, and air.
Such in brief is the dynamic rise
to prominence on the part of a for
mer Farm English major.
Marsden Argall was the very first
singer to appear on tho stage of the
new temple of music. He murmured
the meaningful words, "At last," as
the opening line in the first opera.
Argall gladly showed his dressing
room, which is similar to those al
lotted to the other leading artists.
The opera stars await their calls in
the quiet comfort of boudoirs con
taining ankle-deep rugs, over
stuffed furniture, and chintz hung
windows. Each dressing room has a
tub and shower, an electric refrig
erator, and a loud speaker connected
with the director's office.
The former Stanfordite told how
he spent live years studying in Eu
rope. His time was spent largely in
Milan, Paris, and Berlin, and he
sang in opera throughout Italy.
