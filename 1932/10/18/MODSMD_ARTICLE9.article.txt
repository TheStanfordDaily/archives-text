# Ernie Nevers Will Talk To Card Rooters
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers is going to tell Stan
ford's rooters what it's like to be
out there trying to tote an oval
pigskin through a line of Trojans
who object to such ideas.

Probably the most famous cog
that ever came out of the Big Red
Machine, Nevers agreed last night
to speak at tomorrow night's rally
when "Pop" Warner's 1932 edition
gets its first real send-off of the
season in preparation for the war
like invaders from Troy, who have
been invited to the Indian tea-party
at the stadium Saturday.

With everything in readiness for
the gala though determined gather
in gat the Pavilion at 7:15 o'clock,
Chairman Bob Churchill of the
Rally Committee declared that all
preparations are made for an all-
University jolly-up immediately
following the rally if approval is
granted by the Ex Committee at its
meeting tonight.

Bill Corbus, although not officially
speaking for the committee, declared
last night that campus sentiment
seemed to be greatly in favor of the
proposed dance and that official
sanction would probably be forth
coming tonight.
Churchill added that the jolly-up
is decidedly separate from the rally,
and will not be held'in place of the
affair as stated yesterday in Campus
Opinion. The after-the-rally-jolly
up is something entirely new and is
merely to give Stanford men and
women a chance for a real all-cam
pus dance free from the usual high
admittance tariff.
