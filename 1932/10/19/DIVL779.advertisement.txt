iTke Contrasting Slack Idea
in a 4-piece American Harris Tweed Suit Mm
Two months ago Roos (First again!) introduced the "Town &
Campus" in a Hopsack suit that took California by storm! And
now we "scoop 'em again" with the "Town & Campus" in an
American reproduction of Harris tweed! The suit (coat, vest and
trousers) is of brown Harris tweed: the contrasting slacks of gray
Harris tweed, or vice versa! The slacks are worn on the campus
with the coat, a sweater or leather jacket: the suit for town wear!
Like its predecessor in Hopsack, it's a complete wardrobe in itself!
