# Football Motif To Be Featured At Victory Hop
## "Pop" Warner and Ernie Nevers Will Be Guest of Honor At Saturday Dance Following Indian-Trojan Grid Classic 
### 
WITH football ;«s its motif and Coach "Pop" Warner and Ernie Nevers
as guests of honor, the All-University Victory Dance will be ushered
in this Saturday night at KiiJO o'clock to all those members of the campus
who manage to garner one of the fast-disappearing bids.
Originally planned for the Women's Clubhouse, enthusiasm for the
alTair has spread so rapidly that it has been necessary to enlarge plans,
and stage the dance in the Women's Dance Studio.
The swift sale of bids can be attributed not only to the many features
of the dance, but to the fact that the price has been put within the reach

of all—one dollar per couple at the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union.
Entertainment will be topped* by
Eph Engleman— star of the 1932
Junior Opera—who will act as mas
ter of ceremonies. Headlining the
bill will be Mary Anita Loos
—whose fancy steps were a sensa
tion and a revelation to the campus
last spring quarter.
Two former Stanford students who
crashed the Columbia Broadcasting
System recently have consented to
come down from San Francisco to
present an intermission number.
Fred Pearman, tap-dance artist, and
Adelaide Kelly, professional dancer,
and a member of the Class of '26,
will also be featured. Winsted Wea
ver, popular comedian, completes
the program.
Royal Cardinals
A full group of Royal Cardinals
will provide the necessary rhythm
for dancing. The band will also re
hearse with Master of Ceremonies
Engleman to insure a smooth pre
sentation of the entertainment.
Of course, there will be plenty of
refreshments. For those who find
dancing too strenuous after the
game, bridge tables and the cus
tomary equipment has been pro
vided at no extra charge.
Ample number of guards have
been hired to insure the dance
against being jammed with roughs.
Authorities have assured all that
there will be no repetition of the
situation prevalent at depression
dances.
Local Affair
The dance is to be a Stanford
affair. Only members of the Uni
versity and their friends will be ad
mitted. Visiting friends from the
South will be permitted entrance
only in the company of Stanford
people. No general migration of
Peninsula folk will be tolerated.
The dance was sponsored by the
Stanford Peninsula Club. Marion
Hewlett is chairman of the campus
committee. Said Chairman Hewlett
last night, "For one dollar you get
refreshments, entertainment, and
dancing. With this calibre dance and
this ridiculously low price, it is only
inevitable that this dance is going
over with a bang."
