# OLD BOY'S PET OUT TOMORROW
## 
### 
Once more the Old Boy sits easy
in his swivel chair as the first issue J
! of Chappie comes of! the press to- I
! morrow morning.
Bursting forth with the best "first
j issue" in years, the Chaparral pre-
I sents the acme in humorous litera-
{ture and art, according to Don
| Cameron, editor-in-chief. No spe- j
cial features are promised in the
first number, but the campus will
get a chuckle or two at the expense ]
J of the "all-important-Frosh." |
Fresh from the University Press,
after an absence of three years in
other plants, Chappie will appear mi
, the Quail at 8 o'clock.
