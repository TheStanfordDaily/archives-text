# FRATERNITIES GIVEN DATES FOR RUSHING
## Fraternity Board Confirms One Year Penalty For Illegal Rushing 
### 
The one-year penalty for illegal
rushing was confirmed, and open
dates for rushing of the Class of '36
were set by the Interfraternity
Council in its meeting last night in
the Old Union.
By the former action the council
put into effect the proposal made by
the Interfraternity Board of Control
last week. By the latter move, it
carried out a previously announced
policy to establish several open
periods this quarter for purposes of
better acquainting the Row men
with prospective freshman pledges.
Actual pledging will not take place
until winter quarter.
Open Periods
The open periods, of two days
each, number four—two midweeks
on Wednesday and Thursday, and
two week-ends on Friday and Sat
urday. The scheduled dates as set
by the council are:
Midweek, November 2 and 15
Week-end, November 11 and 12
Midweek, November 30 and
and December 1
Week-end, December !) and 10
The rules governing these open
days are:
1. No all-day rushing will be al
lowed.
2. Meals will be limited to the
hours of 11:30 to 2 o'clock, at lunch,
and 5:30 to 8 o'clock, at dinner.
3. A freshman may visit a par
ticular house only twice in each
period.
4. Invitations will be by the mail
ing card system, as heretofore.
The council also ruled that the
only legal contacts between frater
nity men and freshmen except dur
ing the open days will be "public
informal meetings on the campus."
One Year Penalty
All the above rulings are to be
enforced by the use of the one-year
penalty, which will automatically
apply in every case of conviction. In
other words, if the Interfraternity
Board finds a freshman and a house
guilty of any infraction of any rule,
both the house and the freshman
will be deprived of their pledging
privileges for a solid year.
The council voted to recommend
to the Board that the limit of
pledges from the Class of '36 be
set at 12 instead of the present 10.
This, as well as the other recom
mendations, is subject to the ap
proval of the board.
The council also voted to fine
Zeta Psi and Delta Chi $10 each
for not being represented at the
meeting.

The open periods, of two days
each, number four—two midweeks
on Wednesday and Thursday, and
two week-ends on Friday and Sat
urday. The scheduled dates as set
by the council are:
Midweek, November 2 and 15
Week-end, November 11 and 12
Midweek, November 30 and
and December 1
Week-end, December !) and 10
The rules governing these open
days are:
1. No all-day rushing will be al
lowed.
2. Meals will be limited to the
hours of 11:30 to 2 o'clock, at lunch,
and 5:30 to 8 o'clock, at dinner.
3. A freshman may visit a par
ticular house only twice in each
period.
4. Invitations will be by the mail
ing card system, as heretofore.
The council also ruled that the
only legal contacts between frater
nity men and freshmen except dur
ing the open days will be "public
informal meetings on the campus."
One Year Penalty
All the above rulings are to be
enforced by the use of the one-year
penalty, which will automatically
apply in every case of conviction. In
other words, if the Interfraternity
Board finds a freshman and a house
guilty of any infraction of any rule,
both the house and the freshman
will be deprived of their pledging
privileges for a solid year.
The council voted to recommend
to the Board that the limit of
pledges from the Class of '36 be
set at 12 instead of the present 10.
This, as well as the other recom
mendations, is subject to the ap
proval of the board.
The council also voted to fine
Zeta Psi and Delta Chi $10 each
for not being represented at the
meeting.
The one-year penalty for illegal
rushing was confirmed, and open
dates for rushing of the Class of '36
were set by the Interfraternity
Council in its meeting last night in
the Old Union.
By the former action the council
put into effect the proposal made by
the Interfraternity Board of Control
last week. By the latter move, it
carried out a previously announced
policy to establish several open
periods this quarter for purposes of
better acquainting the Row men
with prospective freshman pledges.
Actual pledging will not take place
until winter quarter.
