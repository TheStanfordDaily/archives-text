WEST ORANGE, N.J., Oct. 18 (TP)
â€”Thirteen men wrapped their coats
closely about them at 3:24 a.m. to
day and trudged through a rain into
the darkness of Rosedale cemetery.
On a grave they placed a wreath,
stood in silence for four minutes,
then left as they had come.
It was at 3:24 a.m. a year ago to
day that watchers were told of the
death of Thomas A. Edison. The
men were executives of the Edison
Companies.
At noon today members of the
family and employees of Thomas
Edison, Inc., were to gather at the
private library of the inventor in
the plant laboratory. Rev. Arthur H.
Brown of the Methodist Episcopal
Church was to lead a memorial ser
vice.
The laboratory, where the in
ventor's body lay in state and was
viewed by thousands, has not been
used since.

Mounts Rainier and Shasta, vol
canos in the United States, emit
heated vapors, giving evidence that
their interiors are still hot.
