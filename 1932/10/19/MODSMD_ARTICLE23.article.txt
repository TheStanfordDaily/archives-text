# Hulme Gives Impressions Of French Life, Thought
## 
### 
Stressing the personality of
France and the French people, Ed
ward Maselin Hulme, Stanford pro
fessor of history, last night gave a
vivid interpretation of French life
and thought to the Assembly Hall
audience.
It is Professor Hulme's impression
that the French demand quality as
the essential characteristic of their
workmanship. He pointed out the
care taken by individual workmen
in the moulding of glass for church
windows; the fact that docks, etc.,
are municipally owned and under
the city are artistically attractive to
everyone.
