### 
THEY meet tonight at 7 o'clock in front of the Fiji House up there at
the head of the Row.
Everyone on the Farm tonight, Indian and Squaw alike, is asked to he
there, either on foot or in automobiles, to join the gala calvacadc thai is
scheduled to proceed at that time down the long Row to the Pavilion
where the fun will begin. Screeching sirens will sound the call to start,
and the Farm's resplendent fire engine will lead the grand procession
which will l>e guided by lighted flares as it marches toward the scene of
the council-of-war for Saturday's fray. Ready to lend color to the torch
light parade, the Stanford band will be on hand to play all of the Indian

Something startlingly unique and
original in stunts is promised those
who crowd into the Pavilion tonight
at 7:15 o'clock to attend the rally
for the Trojan game. Winstead
Weaver, the popular "Doodles" c>f
Stanford, announces a hectic period
of hilarious festivities in the form
of a take-oft of an alleged rally at
Southern California in preparation
for the Stanford contest. A complete
rooting section from the land of
Troy, in full fancy dress, will be
present, it was revealed.
Ncvers to Speak
When Ernie Nevers gets up on
the platform as the featured speaker,
Stanford rooters will hear from one
who KNOWS just what it's like t/i
get out there and meet a Trojan
team that means business with the
pigskin.
Nevers, one of the Farm's most
famous and equally popular heroes,
has been asked to tell the Stanford
of today just what Stanford spirit
meant to the Stanford of yesterday.
Always a great fighter out on the
gridiron himself, the blond giant is
expected to instill plenty of that old
time pep into the Indian rooters.
Team to Appear
When the 1932 edition of that
Red Machine files into the Pavilion
with the Old Fox at its wheel, there
will be lots of determination writ
ten on the faces of those who hope
to be on the turf when the Machine
will attempt to roll over the iti
vadeds. And there will be plenty of
material for thought not only in
those heads, but inside the heart of
every single rooter who will cling
tenaciously to the theory that the
so-called S.C. "jinx" can and will
be broken on Saturday.
Rooters are urgently asked lo
learn the words to Stanford's songs
and yells, especially those that will
be used at the Trojan game. The
songs will be found on page three
of this issue. Stanford fans are asked
especially to memorize the "Trojan
Horse" and "Come Join the Band."
Rooters' Hats
Official rooters' hats may still bo
purchased at Roos Bros, in PahÂ»
Alto at $1 each, it was stressed last
night. No one will be permitted t"
enter the rooting section unless he
is wearing one of these.
Girls who are planning to si I in
the section on Saturday are asked
to wear white clothing in order that
the stunts may prove as effective as
possible.
There will be a package of a
popular brand of cigarettes for every
one as the procession files into the
Pavilion. And the entire campus is
waiting for tonight, as one potent
question haunts the mind of each
hopeful Stanfordite: "Will that Big
Red Machine run into any fiat tires
out there in front of the Trojans
Saturday or will it roll right down
across the Southerners' goal line?"
