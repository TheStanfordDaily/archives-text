The forgotten man is lo he remembered Saturday night
:il Stanford.
The city, svilli ils af ter-the-game festivities, comes, too
high for the average college student even in ordinary
tones, hut positively unlhinkably high in these leanest of
all years. So Stanford, thanks to the alumni women, is
slicing off a piece of the social desert and bringing it down
lo Ihe Farm lo serve red hot at one dollar per couple.
Here il is, indeed a delectable dish. The women's gym
dance studio. Music, in ten pieces. Kph Fugleman as
master of ceremonies. Fntertainment by radio stars. And
last, I»111 as necessary, the "atmosphere" of football, and no
pseudo "atmosphere," at that. Pop Warner, Frnie Xevcrs,
and members of the team thai has beaten the Trojan.
The cilv is okeh, you who have coin of the realm.
Starch up your lux shirts, dust off the silk topper, drive
thirty miles in a jam each way, and just have altogether
one hopping good lime for fifteen fish.
Have a good time trying to guide the only between
lightly jammed 200-pound hotel customers who have never
seen a campus but insist, nevertheless, upon waving Iheir
arms and shouting for dear old Stanford.
Then, if you happen to think for a minute of the less
dough-heavy group that is genuinely Stanford comfortably
< njoying on the Farm all that is the cream, and none that
is the gnil, of the aflcr-llie-game festivity don't moan.
You asked for il.
