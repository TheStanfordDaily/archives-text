# DO YOU INHALE?

Do you inhale? Do you sop up all that old rutabaga
which would-be stumpers of local parts cast into your
daily political swill? Yes, indeed, those are vital questions,
for their answers will determine whether you sit with
avid ear listening to the exhortations of your party cham
pions ;it tomorrow night's political forum debate.
The idea of a forum debate on candidates and party
issues is not particularly new. Neither is it particularly
bad. II is entirely possible that such a discussion may
bring several truths to light, new to those in attendance,
it there are not too many confirmed Republicans, Demo
crats, and Socialists present. That is the principal danger
oi' the political forum prolonged, enthusiastic applause
with whatever honors the debate may cany going to the
toughest palms aud the shrillest whistles.
"Will President Hoover become a California!) again,
long enough to cast his vote in Palo Alto, where that one
ballot 111ii>hI make ;i great deal more ditt'erenee than it
would in Washington?" You won't hear that question dis
cussed. "Did Roosevelt and Smith look so ill at ease in
those recent movies of their reconciliation because each
had his lingers crossed, and the handclasp was uncomfort
able?" You won't Ii 11 <1 out anything about that either.
No, if you're ;i Republican you'll hear ;ill about Hoover,
."iid you'll laugh and smirk throughout the Roosevelt and
Thomas speeches. You'll curl your lip two-thirds of the
time if von belong to one of the three major parlies. You'll
give ear to all the old party ballyhoo you've already heard
and already believe. You'll have all the old tariff, prohi
bition, and economic reconstruction delicacies dished up
before you..
Rut don't eat that, mister
