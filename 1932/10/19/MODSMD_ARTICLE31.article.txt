# A 						PRETTY PASS, GENTLEMEN

### 
A lino kettle of old lisli! Ho re i! is, throe days before
I lie P.SC. i<;inio, and those losels who run the Dailij Trojan
haven't done or said a single tiling that the Daily can pick
n fight about. Things have indeed come to a pretty pass
when this historic and traditional verbal brawl must go
its way into the dusty discard.
As a source of red-hot editorials that literally throw
themselves into type it luis had no equal. No one wants to
throw the old hobnails into that tinny Trojan armor any
more than we do, and nobody doubts much what I'.S.C.
thinks of the Stanford Indian, especially at this time of the
morning. And what the editors could say about each other
;:t ;i time like this or any other time for that matter would
make excellent reading, no doubt. Hut you don't call a guy
names unless he sticks his beagle out.
II is in truth a burning shame to see this annual battle
of the journalistic master minds die out. Hut perhaps we
have the well-known occasion of the handwriting on the
wall. Probably there is another time-worn custom that is
about to go by the boards. In fact, the Old Man of the
Mountain has bent to whisper in a bronze Indian's ear:
" The Trojan ain'ta gonta win atall, atall. His new armor's
onlv cheese, cheese, choose."
