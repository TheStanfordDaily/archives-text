# BULL SESSION
## CAT'S OUT OF THE BAG 
### 
The annoying question of what to i
do U.S.C. night has finally been laid i
1o rest. Like a jittery ghost suffer
ing with conniptions, the spectre;
has been haunting the campus for
two weeks. The students had two
horrible alternatives: playing the
meat in a human meat-grinder up
at some San Francisco hotel or
j studying. Many did not desire to
t mix with all the butchers, bakers,
and bootleggers that usually jam the
City on such occasions.
The campus knew that week-end
dancing was far from the most ex
hilarating sport in the City; and
that a U.S.C. nite was 57 different
| week-end mobs all packed on to
, the same floor. It defies science, to
j be sure; and it defies dancing as
well. But studying on this night of
nights was infinitely more painful
than jabbing oneself with red-hot
daggers to the tune of "Fight On for
i U.S.C." What to do? That was still
, the question.
And now the question has been
answered—and answered with a
bang. The Daily—always first with
the latest—has scooped the Bull
i Session to print the details on the
! front page. Nevertheless, generally
the plan is to have an All-Univer
! sity dance in the Women's Dance
Studio—the Dance Studio being that
! rococo room opposite the patio from
! the Women's Gym.
The affair is being sponsored by
the Peninsula Stanford Club. And
as a result some bids have already
been sold to some of the younger
alumni in the Bay Region. The cam
pus had better act at once via the
A.S.S.U. office or Saturday night

! will find a dismal band standing j
! dollar-in-hand and girl-on-arm out- ]
j side the Gym. Bids are limited; and
i that doesn't mean to the number
i who procrastinate and stroll over i
! the night of the dance.
Veritable armies of guards have
been mustered into service; to place
| a gentle but none the less firm
i check on any meandering roughs.'
1 Even though the price has been kept j
i down due to the willing co-opera
| tion of so many individuals and so
many organizations—the dance is
i not of the much discussed "depres
| sion variety." Unattached males
I will not be admitted. Also, the dance j
iis not to be a general stamping j
| grounds for the San Jose sweeties j
: and their Menlo Park mashers. Out- |
j siders will not be admitted.
With little Ephie Engleman—six- [
; foot-two-inches in his bare feet and !
| even higher when he gets civilized
and slips into his size thirteen
booties—as master of ceremonies;
; ably assisted by Mary Anita Loos,
! famous for her Junior Opera legs— I
i the entertainment is sure to click, j
i The ten-piece dance band also will j
| help.
The rumor that certain entertain- I
ment centers in San Francisco had I
attempted to use informal pressure !
to stop this campus dance was not j
substantiated. They really needn't |
worry, however, because even i
though Stanford students fail to fill |
! their floor this year, there will be,

1o rest. Like a jittery ghost suffer
ing with conniptions, the spectre;
has been haunting the campus for
two weeks. The students had two
horrible alternatives: playing the
meat in a human meat-grinder up
at some San Francisco hotel or
j studying. Many did not desire to
t mix with all the butchers, bakers,
