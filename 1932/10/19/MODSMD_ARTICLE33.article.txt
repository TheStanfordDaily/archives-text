LUCIA (Donizetti). At the War
Memorial Opera (louse.
Lily Pons, greeted by New York
as Marion Talley was, proved to
San Francisco that this time the
praise was fully justified. The ve
hicle chosen for her appearance was
merely a collection of beautiful
melodies and vocal exercises bound
together to form an opera. This
work, however, gave Miss Pons fine
opportunities, which were added to
by merciless cutting of all scenes
in which she did not appear.
But the result was far better than
even the most optimistic could ex
pect. Lily Pons has not the mechan
ical perfection of Galli-Curci, but
possesses a richer voice which gives
full tone quality and volume to even
the highest notes. And without in
terfering with the melody she is
able to put full emotional quality
into the arias—a very rare thing in
Italian opera.
The whole opera is built to her
mad scene, and was so cut thyt she
sang continuously for twenty min
utes, including the "perche ho del
vento" which is seldom included.
Usually a vocal exercise which at
tracts because it is difficult to sing,
the mad scene became a thing of
beauty and poignant melody, sung
so effortlessly that one forgot how
difficult it was. Her acting through
out the performance was remark
ably good, especially considering the
stiffness of the opera.
Francesco Merli also made his
San Francisco debut, but was lost
in the general enthusiasm for Pons.
During the first two acts he played
down; in the fourth act—Lucia dead
—he had his opportunity and did
well, although the audience had
spent its applause. His role was too
stiff to allow much acting, but he
did his best, using his voice to ex
cellent advantage. The attempt to
crowd real emotion into the very
thin melodies kept him from ex
hibiting his vocal abilities. —C.A.Z.

TOPPER TAKES A TRlP—'Thome
Smith. Douhleday Doran and Co.
1932. ($2.50.)
Like Thome Smith's other books
(among them "Night Life of the
Gods" and "The Stray Lamb") this
volume is completely and madly
i abandoned to idiocy which is amus
i ing and occasionally even hilarious.
But, as well, like most of Smith's
books, the ending is sentimental and
highly unsuited as the finish of such
madness. It is a constant and mali
! cious practice, this, and the most
I obvious weakness of a series of

books which should amuse almost i
anyone but the ethereal if ever- |
present Aunt Agatha.
This book is funny, although the I
first of the author's books to be !
read is almost sure to be the most j
amusing because it is the most un- j
expectedly audacious. Advised for
melancholia. —J.S.S.
TIIE STRUGGLE—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
This picture is just another
pathetically tragic presentation of j
the liquor traffic (and incidentally j
a rap at prohibition).
It's the story of a man who lost !
his job because he got drunk, the J
narrative of his gradual descent in I
the scale of personal pride until he
becomes just a common bum on the
street.
Then in a melodramatic climax, i
his little daughter saves him, j
and he makes a comeback with the j
inevitable happy ending.
The plot may be real, but the act- ,
ing is superficial. Tearing scenes of I
sorrow are just as apt to draw j
laughs for the way they are over- !
played—too many tears and etno- I
tions entirely extrovert.
Hal Skelly gives an admirable in- j
terpretation of a drunk, but as "the 1
man who came back" he's a dead j
flop. Zita Johann makes a sweet j
and trusting wife, but she seems to j
have only two expressions—wistful ,
joy and abject sorrow.
As a presentation of actual con
ditions, the entire thing is an over- |
played, highly exaggerated myth.

Lily Pons, greeted by New York
as Marion Talley was, proved to
San Francisco that this time the
praise was fully justified. The ve
hicle chosen for her appearance was
merely a collection of beautiful
melodies and vocal exercises bound
together to form an opera. This
work, however, gave Miss Pons fine
opportunities, which were added to
by merciless cutting of all scenes
in which she did not appear.
But the result was far better than
even the most optimistic could ex
pect. Lily Pons has not the mechan
ical perfection of Galli-Curci, but
possesses a richer voice which gives
full tone quality and volume to even
the highest notes. And without in
terfering with the melody she is
able to put full emotional quality
into the arias—a very rare thing in
Italian opera.
The whole opera is built to her
mad scene, and was so cut thyt she
sang continuously for twenty min
utes, including the "perche ho del
vento" which is seldom included.
Usually a vocal exercise which at
tracts because it is difficult to sing,
the mad scene became a thing of
beauty and poignant melody, sung
so effortlessly that one forgot how
difficult it was. Her acting through
out the performance was remark
ably good, especially considering the
stiffness of the opera.
Francesco Merli also made his
San Francisco debut, but was lost
in the general enthusiasm for Pons.
During the first two acts he played
down; in the fourth act—Lucia dead
—he had his opportunity and did
well, although the audience had
spent its applause. His role was too
stiff to allow much acting, but he
did his best, using his voice to ex
cellent advantage. The attempt to
crowd real emotion into the very
thin melodies kept him from ex
hibiting his vocal abilities. —C.A.Z.

Like Thome Smith's other books

But, as well, like most of Smith's

anyone but the ethereal if ever- |
present Aunt Agatha.
This book is funny, although the I
first of the author's books to be !
read is almost sure to be the most j
amusing because it is the most un- j
expectedly audacious. Advised for
melancholia. —J.S.S.
TIIE STRUGGLE—At the New
Menlo Theatre.
This picture is just another
pathetically tragic presentation of j
the liquor traffic (and incidentally j
a rap at prohibition).
It's the story of a man who lost !
his job because he got drunk, the J
narrative of his gradual descent in I
the scale of personal pride until he
becomes just a common bum on the
street.
Then in a melodramatic climax, i
his little daughter saves him, j
and he makes a comeback with the j
inevitable happy ending.
The plot may be real, but the act- ,
ing is superficial. Tearing scenes of I
sorrow are just as apt to draw j
laughs for the way they are over- !
played—too many tears and etno- I
tions entirely extrovert.
Hal Skelly gives an admirable in- j
terpretation of a drunk, but as "the 1
man who came back" he's a dead j
flop. Zita Johann makes a sweet j
and trusting wife, but she seems to j
have only two expressions—wistful ,
joy and abject sorrow.
As a presentation of actual con
ditions, the entire thing is an over- |
played, highly exaggerated myth.
