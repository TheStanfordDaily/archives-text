Averages moved up 1.60 yester- .
day. The rails were especially :
strong, the tobacco shares weak, j
and oiLs on the whole irregular de
spite the good showing revealed in 1
the report of Atlantic Refining for J
the first nine months of this year.
Volume was only a million shares. j
This is definitely not a market in !
which the public is interested.
Radio, once a dynamic market
leader, has behaved quietly for j
some time. Dividends on both ;
classes of preferred have been omit
ted. The radio industry does not j
appear to have enjoyed the sales I
predicted because of political pro
grams. Inventories of weaker and
insolvent companies are still being j
liquidated. Most of the large radio j
manufacturers have introduced j
cheaper sets in the $20-$5O field; yet j
this figure does not allow much for j
trade-in allowances.
Rumor has it that RCA is await
ing completion of Radio City, the 1
opening of which is scheduled for j
next fall, before marketing televi- |
sion sets. National Broadcasting j
Company, Radio's wholly owned [
subsidiary, is supposed to be meet- j
ing expenses and tossing a few ,
dimes in the net profit chest.
Apparently nothing has come of i
the suggested combine of Radio, j
Western Union, and International j
Telephone (owns Postal). The fed- j
eral authorities are openly opposed j
to such a merger.
Radio has 13,000,000 shares of I
common outstanding, a majority of j
I which is held by General Electric j
l and Westinghouse. The common
| stock and preferred "B" appear to
| be good current speculations, to be
! sold when a fair profit has been
i realized.
