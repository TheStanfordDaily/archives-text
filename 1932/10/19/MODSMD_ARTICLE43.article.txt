# Three New Rushing Rules Adopted By Pan-Hellenic
## 
### 
Three proposals effecting consid
erable change in womens' ushing;
rules were adopted officially by â– 
Pan-Hellenic in a meeting Monday J
| night. The new rules, as suggested j
at last week's meeting, follow:
1. That only one sorority woman :
! accompany each rushee to Roble 1
! after rushing parties are over.
2. That on arrival at Roble, soror
ity women do not accompany rush- I
I ees to the door of the hall.
3. That no house be allowed to j
phone a new woman for any reason j
i whatsoever. Contact must be made j
1 through the sponsors. If articles are i
left at the houses they are to be |
| turned over to the Pan-Hellenic I
| president, and she will leave them j
[ at the desk at Roble. j
An additional rule, that no house 1
may ask a new woman to break a
: date already made with another 1
' house, will go into effect during (
winter rushing. This rule was j
adopted by Pan-Hellenic last spring.

i
According to reports made from
the University of California's soror- |
i ity leaders, blind-dating is an un- !
! satisfactory institution and fit only i
I for freshman girls.
