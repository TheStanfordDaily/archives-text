"The Trojan Ilorse"
In the days of long ago, the
mighty Trojan host
Held that they were the war- ;
riors supreme;
But a little wooden horse upset
their haughty boast,
And their glory was only a
dream.
Now the Trojans have a name
sake down at Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boast
ful can be;
But they're goin' to meet their
master, for the Cardinal
Will play horse with old U.S.C.
"Come Join The Hand"
Come, join the band,
And give a cheer for Stanford ,
red;
Throughout the land
Our banner waving overhead;
Stanford, for fou,
Each loyal comrade brave and
true
With might and main sings this
refrain,
"Forever and forever, Stanford
red." i

| After the game,"
When Stanford Red has won
the day,
j Praising her name,
Down the field we'll force our
way;
And- on the green
Each man who joins the ser
pentine,
With might and main sings this
refrain,
"Forever and forever Stanford
red."
NOTE: Whistle and wave hats to
time—then sing verse again. This is
a march—get the swing of it and
make it lively.
"Sons of the Stanford Red"
Sons of the Stanford red,
Fight for your Alma Mater;
j Fight for the fame of the Stanford
name—
Undaunted forge ahead.
Hearts that are brave and true,
Down with the gold and blue,
j Shoulder to shoulder, fight and
win,
I Sons of the Stanford red.
