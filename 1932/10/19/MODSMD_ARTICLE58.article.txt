## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (/P)—Secre- ;
j tary Stimson told the National Re- I
j publican Club tonight that Franklin
iD. Roosevelt by an "incredibly j
I reckless misstatement of facts" and
j the Democratic House by acts of
! ''reckless irresponsibility" had de
; layed economic recovery.
The Secretary of State said Roose
' velt had "dealt a blow" at recovery
by an attack on President Hoover's 1
economic measures and the Recon
j struction Corporation in his speech
on "the forgotten man."
Turning to the vice-presidential
! candidate on the Democratic ticket,
Stimson said President Hoover did
not have Speaker Garner's "willing
i support" in balancing the budget.
; He added that the activities of the
| House "set back the cause of re- ;
I covery at the most critical period;
| of last spring."
! Roosevelt, Stimson said, "has told
! us of King James' ferry boats and
; Alice in Wonderland and liumpty
1 Dumpty, but upon specific questions
| upon which more than anything
; else the economic recovery of this
Nation depends ... he has said
j nothing." I

| Roosevelt has remained silent on
| the bonus, he said, when every day
of silence was a blow to the credit
j of his Government and the restora
tion of business.
Asserting the Democratic nomi
nee, as Governor of New York,
i had done nothing to correct specu
lative abuses which he now criti
-1 cizes, the Cabinet officer said "the
1 people of this country might well
ask of Franklin Roosevelt that be
fore he sought to be 'ruler over
many things' he might better show
himself 'faithful to the few.' "
Stimson said at the outset the Na
tion was facing an election in many
ways "more critical and important
; than any which this country has
faced since the Civil War."
"A false step from the firm path
j that has been taken might well
j throw us back into a morass even
deeper than the one out of which
we have pulled ourselves," he said.
"In the coming elections we must
choose the man who shall be our
leader in this difficult situation and
upon whose shoulders shall rest the
responsibility for carrying on the
i work of saving the Nation."

NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (/P)—Secre- ;
j tary Stimson told the National Re- I
j publican Club tonight that Franklin
iD. Roosevelt by an "incredibly j
I reckless misstatement of facts" and
j the Democratic House by acts of
! ''reckless irresponsibility" had de
; layed economic recovery.
The Secretary of State said Roose
' velt had "dealt a blow" at recovery
by an attack on President Hoover's 1
economic measures and the Recon
j struction Corporation in his speech
on "the forgotten man."
Turning to the vice-presidential
! candidate on the Democratic ticket,
Stimson said President Hoover did
not have Speaker Garner's "willing
i support" in balancing the budget.
; He added that the activities of the
| House "set back the cause of re- ;
I covery at the most critical period;
| of last spring."
! Roosevelt, Stimson said, "has told
! us of King James' ferry boats and
; Alice in Wonderland and liumpty
1 Dumpty, but upon specific questions
| upon which more than anything
; else the economic recovery of this
Nation depends ... he has said
j nothing." I

| Roosevelt has remained silent on
| the bonus, he said, when every day
of silence was a blow to the credit
j of his Government and the restora
tion of business.
