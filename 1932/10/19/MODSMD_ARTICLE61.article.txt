## 
### 
NEW YORK, Ocl. 18 (£»)—Jimmie
| Foxx, the Maryland mauler and new
| home run king of the major leagues,
is the choice of the experts as the
! American League's most valuable
: player for the 1932 campaign.
The first baseman of the Phila
-1 delphia Athletics, by polling out 75
! points out of a maximum of 80 in
! the vote conducted by a committee
i of the Baseball Writers' Association
|of America, beat his New York
| rival, Larruping Lou Gehrig, by a
i decisive margin. Gehrig, winner in
! 1927 and now runner-up for the
| third successive year, received 55
1 points.
The selection of Foxx makes the
I most valuable player contest an all—
1 Philadelphia affair this year. Chuck
! Klein, Phillie outfield slugger, al-
I ready has been designated as the
j National League's outstanding star
j of the yeai\ in preference to Lon
Warneke of the Cubs and Lefty
O'Doul of the Dodgers. The vote in
■ j both contests was made public by

J. Roy Stockton of St. Louis, chair
man of the selection committee in
each league.
Foxx is the third of Connie
Mack's outstanding stars to gain
this individual distinction within the
past five years. Mickey Cochrane
won the official league award in
1928. Bob Grove was the, choice last
year of the Writers' Association,
which has taken over the job of
selection since the formal awards
were abolished by the National and
American leagues.
Although nosed out within the
last week for the batting cham
pionship by Dale Alexander of the
Red Sox, Foxx enjoyed his greatest
year despite the slump of the As
as a team.
The big first-sacker, with fifty
eight home runs, set a new major
league record for right-handed bats
men and came the closest of anyone
to touching Babe Ruth's high mark
of 00. Foxx also led both leagues in
runs driven in, with 167, and wound
up with a batting percentage of .364.

NEW YORK, Ocl. 18 (£»)—Jimmie
| Foxx, the Maryland mauler and new
| home run king of the major leagues,
is the choice of the experts as the
! American League's most valuable
: player for the 1932 campaign.
The first baseman of the Phila
-1 delphia Athletics, by polling out 75
! points out of a maximum of 80 in
! the vote conducted by a committee
i of the Baseball Writers' Association
|of America, beat his New York
| rival, Larruping Lou Gehrig, by a
i decisive margin. Gehrig, winner in
! 1927 and now runner-up for the
| third successive year, received 55
1 points.
The selection of Foxx makes the
I most valuable player contest an all—
1 Philadelphia affair this year. Chuck
! Klein, Phillie outfield slugger, al-
I ready has been designated as the
j National League's outstanding star
j of the yeai\ in preference to Lon
Warneke of the Cubs and Lefty
O'Doul of the Dodgers. The vote in
■ j both contests was made public by

J. Roy Stockton of St. Louis, chair
man of the selection committee in
each league.
Foxx is the third of Connie
Mack's outstanding stars to gain
this individual distinction within the
past five years. Mickey Cochrane
won the official league award in
1928. Bob Grove was the, choice last
year of the Writers' Association,
which has taken over the job of
selection since the formal awards
were abolished by the National and
American leagues.
Although nosed out within the
last week for the batting cham
pionship by Dale Alexander of the
Red Sox, Foxx enjoyed his greatest
year despite the slump of the As
as a team.
The big first-sacker, with fifty
eight home runs, set a new major
league record for right-handed bats
men and came the closest of anyone
to touching Babe Ruth's high mark
of 00. Foxx also led both leagues in
