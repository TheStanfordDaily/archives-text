Well, with most of the little
fellows out of the way. Notre
Dame ought to start showing
what it really has in a week or
two. The Ramblers have run up
something like 2<i7 points with
out having the chalk on their
goal line as much as marred.
Notre Dame, Fordham and Pitts
burgh seem due to be about the
best ever. But they all have tough
schedules, and one defeat is all that
is necessary to remove a team from
the national picture.
Southern California meets Notre
in Los Angeles December 10,
St. Mary's takes on Fordham's
Rams in New York November 5, and
Stanford takes on Warner's former
team in the smoky city November
2(j. Out of some of these games
should come the national champion.
Hut the team that finally makes the
grade will have scaled one of the
toughest paths that ever the champ
had to climb.

Aside from Southern Califor
nia and the Berkeley Cubs, one
of the major worries that has
the frosh football players in its
grip is the question of how to
make yardage when the pants
don't keep time.
It seems that so far this season
no less than four of the cherubs
have dropped their padded mole
skins when in full flight. And so
far none of them has been able to
figure out a way to precent such
occurrences from happening at em
barrassing moments.
In I lie Ucla game, Ihe slippery
Bob Grayson was seemingly away
to the races when a small Bruin
• nibbed the Grayson pants from the
rear. Grayson kept moving. The
referee failed to blow the official
whistle. But the Grayson pants did
not keep up with the play.
According to one of our special
undercover agents, it is said that
sloppy cleaning last year weakened
the fabric and made the current
result inevitable. Whatever that
means!!!!

Hp jn the city civil war is
brewing with the approaching
Olympic Club-University of San
Francisco battle due to break
<mt this week-end. Both teams
liave lest four games, and they
are both famished for a gargle
from the mythical victor's cup.
After watching the Dons,put up
;i great light against the horde from
Ihe Moraga Valley last Sunday,
Coach Nick Busch of the Winged O
figures that he is all set to realize
his ambition.
The news that La horde will he
ready for the Trojan fracas is
good news, but it is doubtful
how much value he will be after
a week oil crutches. The life of
a cripple may he great for the
shoulders but it doesn't help
the legs <lo anything but get
skinny.
When you come to a game with
Brother Jones's horde, you have to
have big, fast tackles who are in
perfect shape to lake all that a
bunch of tired-up stars can give.
This year's backfield on the
Thunderless Herd lacks only the
polish that characterized last year's
lour bone-crushers. They have
plenty of class, and don't think that
all the ground gaining will be done
by Indians Saturday.
As for the line, we will agree
that they have a great one, but
we're not conceding (o anybody
that they have a line that is
vastly superior to ours. Any
forward wall that has men like
Corhus, Bates, Kite. Colvin,
Don I) and the rest of the Cards
in it, cannot he classed as very
much below the par of any
body's line. Every man on the
Stanford line, and there are
plenty of replacements, is a far
better player than he was a year
ago. If the game is going to be
decided on line play alone, we
are not asking or giving any
odds. We'll he around!!!!

Hp jn the city civil war is
brewing with the approaching
Olympic Club-University of San
Francisco battle due to break
<mt this week-end. Both teams
liave lest four games, and they
are both famished for a gargle
from the mythical victor's cup.
After watching the Dons,put up
;i great light against the horde from
Ihe Moraga Valley last Sunday,
Coach Nick Busch of the Winged O
figures that he is all set to realize
his ambition.
The news that La horde will he
ready for the Trojan fracas is
good news, but it is doubtful
how much value he will be after
a week oil crutches. The life of
a cripple may he great for the
shoulders but it doesn't help
the legs <lo anything but get
skinny.
When you come to a game with
Brother Jones's horde, you have to
have big, fast tackles who are in
perfect shape to lake all that a
bunch of tired-up stars can give.
This year's backfield on the
Thunderless Herd lacks only the
polish that characterized last year's
lour bone-crushers. They have
plenty of class, and don't think that
all the ground gaining will be done
by Indians Saturday.
As for the line, we will agree
that they have a great one, but
we're not conceding (o anybody
that they have a line that is
vastly superior to ours. Any
forward wall that has men like
Corhus, Bates, Kite. Colvin,
Don I) and the rest of the Cards
in it, cannot he classed as very
much below the par of any
body's line. Every man on the
Stanford line, and there are
plenty of replacements, is a far
better player than he was a year
ago. If the game is going to be
decided on line play alone, we
are not asking or giving any
odds. We'll he around!!!!

Well, with most of the little
fellows out of the way. Notre
Dame ought to start showing
what it really has in a week or
two. The Ramblers have run up
something like 2<i7 points with
out having the chalk on their
goal line as much as marred.
Notre Dame, Fordham and Pitts
burgh seem due to be about the
best ever. But they all have tough
schedules, and one defeat is all that
is necessary to remove a team from
the national picture.
Southern California meets Notre
in Los Angeles December 10,
St. Mary's takes on Fordham's
Rams in New York November 5, and
Stanford takes on Warner's former
team in the smoky city November
2(j. Out of some of these games
should come the national champion.
Hut the team that finally makes the
grade will have scaled one of the
toughest paths that ever the champ
had to climb.

Aside from Southern Califor
nia and the Berkeley Cubs, one
of the major worries that has
the frosh football players in its
grip is the question of how to
make yardage when the pants
don't keep time.
It seems that so far this season
no less than four of the cherubs
have dropped their padded mole
skins when in full flight. And so
far none of them has been able to
figure out a way to precent such
occurrences from happening at em
barrassing moments.
