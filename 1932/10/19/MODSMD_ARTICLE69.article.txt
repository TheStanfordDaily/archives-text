# Freshmen Play Menlo as "Breather" Saturday
## INDIAN YEARLINGS EXPECT TO TRIM MENLO OAK TEAM Victory Over U. C. L. A. Adds To Overconfidence Of Freshman Squad 
### Robert Denton 
Burdened down by overconfidence,
the Stanford freshmen were never
theless able to defeat U.C.L.A. last
week. This same optimism will
hamper the Indian yearlings against
Menlo Junior College Saturday, but
"Chuck" Winterburn's team is so
strong that they will probably win
anyway.
The class of '3G gridders are due
to receive a line jolt on the chin be
fore the season is over, but Menlo
does not seem strong enough to turn
the trick. It would be much better
for the freshmen to suffer their an
nual let-down in an unimportant
game, but it will probably occur
against the California or Southern
California freshmen.
Mediocre Opposition
To be sure, Stanford has piled up
an improssive early season record,
but a good part of their opposition
has been of high-school variety.
Second and third string players are
the only members of the Indian
squad who have shown the same
enthusiasm that has characterized
varsity practices. Even members of
the "Pickled Squad" are taking more
interest in the game than the so
called first stringers.
Hundred and twenty-seven pound
Heinie Rolph, who could use about
a hundred pounds of his famous
uncle's weight, is showing a lot of
pep from his sixth string quarter
back position, as is Eliot Jones, a
gawky seventh-string end.
142-Pound End
Charles Fontius, 142 pounds, is the
lightest man on the regular fresh
man squad. He is also an end.
1929 and 1930 were big football
years for Menlo Junior College, as
the flower of Southland's prepdom
migrated to North PoJo Alto with
high hopes of someday playing for
Pop Warner.
Menlo Stars
The Menlo stars who didn't flunk
out found they couldn't get into
Stanford anyway, so they returned
to delivering ice except for a few
who followed Dud Degroot to San
Jose State. The only good player's
from last year's team are Durant,
an end, and Captain Ted Corbella,
who is a hard-hitting fullback.
Arnie Anderson, an athletic hero at
Palo Alto two or three years ago,
is a fairly fast halfback, but not
sturdy enough for college compe
tition.
