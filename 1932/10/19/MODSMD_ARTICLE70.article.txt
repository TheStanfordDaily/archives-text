Ruth Fisher and Betty Lewton
have been chosen to take the Local
Rating umpire test given by the
United States Field Hockey asso
ciation at the University of Cali
fornia Sunday. If successful they
will referee at the Triangular Sports
Day at Mills College on October 29.
To receive a Local Rating of "B"
or "C" a candidate must pass a
written or oral examination and take
two practical tests, each consisting
of umpiring a period of at least 20
minutes of a game. The passing
mark for written work is 80 per
cent, "B"; 70 per cent, "C."
The umpire ratings are sponsored
by the United States Field Hocky
association in order to comply with
the steady demand for rated um
pires in school games. At present
there are 18 "C" rating umpires on
the Pacific coast.
