# WOLVERINES RATED CO-FAVORITE FOR WESTERN CONFERENCE TITLE
## 
### 
j Coach Harry Kipko of Michigan
i has come to the fore of the Big Ten
■ again this year after suffering the
I loss of five-sevenths of his 1931
' line.
The Wolverines were not highly
i regarded at the beginning of the
j season, but victories over North
i western (15-6) and Ohio State
! (14-0) have placed them in the po
j sition of co-favorites for the West
ern Conference title. Morrison, cen
; ter; Hozer and La Jeunnesse,
1 guards; Aucr and Samuels, tackles,
j were all regulars last year, and not
i one of them returned for the 19152
' campaign.
] The 1931 backs and ends are back
! for more playing—Captain William
: son and Petoskey (who can also
play in the backfield) are the Wol
verine wingmen. Fay and Ever
hardus do the halfbacking.

Michigan is strongly fortified at
quarterback and fullback. Harry
Newman, one of the best safety men
in the country, returns nearly every
kick for fifteen or twenty yards. He
is a fine passer, and is hard to drag
down on off tackle smashes. And
the fullbacks! Regecgi (pronounced
raygayski), Vuchinich (pronounced
?), Wetzel, and Mandula are all
swell players in spite of their names.
Regecgi is one of the best kickers
in the big ten. Vuchinich is a crack
blocker, Wetzel is a smashing
plunger, and Mandula (a member
of the "beef trust," as Howard
Moore likes lo term it), is good at
everything.
Michigan plays Pittsburgh Satur
day afternoon. If lvipke's eleven can
beat the Panthers, they will be hard
to beat fof" the rest of the season.
Stanford rooters will be pulling for
Pittsburgh, of course, because the
Indians would like to face a Panther
team with an undefeated season
record behind her.
The harder they come, (ho harder
lliey fall.

quarterback and fullback. Harry
Newman, one of the best safety men
in the country, returns nearly every
kick for fifteen or twenty yards. He
is a fine passer, and is hard to drag
down on off tackle smashes. And
the fullbacks! Regecgi (pronounced
raygayski), Vuchinich (pronounced
?), Wetzel, and Mandula are all
swell players in spite of their names.
Regecgi is one of the best kickers
in the big ten. Vuchinich is a crack
blocker, Wetzel is a smashing
plunger, and Mandula (a member
of the "beef trust," as Howard
Moore likes lo term it), is good at
everything.
Michigan plays Pittsburgh Satur
day afternoon. If lvipke's eleven can
beat the Panthers, they will be hard
to beat fof" the rest of the season.
Stanford rooters will be pulling for
Pittsburgh, of course, because the
Indians would like to face a Panther
team with an undefeated season
record behind her.
The harder they come, (ho harder
lliey fall.
