# Ban Planes At Port Saturday
## 
### 
Football fans who might bo plan
ning to fly to Palo Alto Saturday
for the Stanford-Southern Califor
! nia game have been asked to use
1 other transportation in a joint letter
| sent yesterday to all California air
j ports by officials of Stanford Uni
j versity and the Palo Alto Airport.
Although the letters say the local
| airport will be closed Saturday, an
! influx of planes is expected since
officials will be powerless to prevent
I their landing.
In co-operation with the Univer
i sity, A. W. Gorman, general man
-1 ager of the flying field, is prepared
I to keep all planes on the field Sat-
I urday night, preventing their de
! parture until daylight Sunday,
i University officials are opposed to
j planes flying here for the game be
j cause of stunt flying over the stad
| ium in other years.
I Newspaper planes have been the
chief offenders of other years, ac-
I cording to officials. Two years ago
127 airships brought football fans
to Stanford for the U.S.C. game and
: an even greater number were ex
pected this year.
