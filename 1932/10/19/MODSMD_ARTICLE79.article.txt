# MALONEY JUGGLES SOCCER LINEUP FOR S. F. U. GAME
## 
### 
Juggling men about in various
positions was the order of the day
at varsity soccer practice yesterday,
with Coach Harry Maloncy making
several important lineup changes in
an effort to strengthen the squad j
that will meet the sti'ong S.F.U. j
eleven Saturday morning.
San Francisco looks like the class |
of the league at the present time,
with impressive wins over San Jose
and San Mateo to their credit. The
Stanford varsity, stronger last year, j
played two tie games with the Dons j
during the 1931 season.
Need Strong Team
Maloney realizes that he will have ■
to put a strong team on the field |
for this encounter, a stronger team |
than that which went up against
San Mateo and San Jose in the last
two games. That is, the team must
be stronger if it expects to win. In
an attempt to bring about this very
strengthening, the recent shifts have I
been made.
The new fullback combination of
Waddy White and Erwin Brekel
baum looked good in yesterday's
I scrimmage as they kept the seconds
1 from doing any scoring. White is a
j made-over halfback, whose hard
j kicking makes him particularly
I adaptable to the duties of a full.
Spohr Plays Half
Removing White from his half-
I back spot left a gap that Maloney
j filled by Alex Spohr, who formerly ■
; played at center half. Laurie Wash
burn, who was playing fullback last
week, returns to center half. Doug
Kennedy makes up the third of this
trio.
The forward wall lined up pre- i
I cisely as it did in the latter stages

of the San Mateo game, with Rojas
playing outside right, Johnson, in
side right, Hearn, center forward,
Velarde, inside left, and Knecht,
outside left.
Newman Goalie
Milt Newman was installed as first
string goalie last night, now that
Brekelbaum is back at fullback, and
the former frosh justified his stand
ing by making several good stops,
including one of Gas Rojas's penalty
kicks.
After Maloney got through with
the varsity last night, he brought
Buster Holmes' frosh on the field
and scrimmaged them with the var
sity seconds. The two teams played
until after dark, with the score end
ing in a 1-1 deadlock.
Frosh Look Good
The frosh forwards looked excep
tionally good for this early in the
season, but particular weakness was
I shown with the fullbacks who were
i repeatedly sucked away from the
goal.
First game of the freshman sea
son is with Mission High of Sail
Francisco, to be played either Fri
' day or Wednesday of this week. <

ing in a 1-1 deadlock.
Frosh Look Good
The frosh forwards looked excep
tionally good for this early in the
season, but particular weakness was
I shown with the fullbacks who were
i repeatedly sucked away from the
goal.
First game of the freshman sea
son is with Mission High of Sail
Francisco, to be played either Fri
' day or Wednesday of this week. <
Juggling men about in various
positions was the order of the day
at varsity soccer practice yesterday,
with Coach Harry Maloncy making
several important lineup changes in
an effort to strengthen the squad j
that will meet the sti'ong S.F.U. j
eleven Saturday morning.
San Francisco looks like the class |
of the league at the present time,
with impressive wins over San Jose
and San Mateo to their credit. The
Stanford varsity, stronger last year, j
played two tie games with the Dons j
during the 1931 season.
Need Strong Team
Maloney realizes that he will have ■
to put a strong team on the field |
for this encounter, a stronger team |
than that which went up against
San Mateo and San Jose in the last
two games. That is, the team must
be stronger if it expects to win. In
an attempt to bring about this very
strengthening, the recent shifts have I
been made.
The new fullback combination of
Waddy White and Erwin Brekel
baum looked good in yesterday's
I scrimmage as they kept the seconds
1 from doing any scoring. White is a
j made-over halfback, whose hard
j kicking makes him particularly
I adaptable to the duties of a full.
Spohr Plays Half
Removing White from his half-
I back spot left a gap that Maloney
j filled by Alex Spohr, who formerly ■
; played at center half. Laurie Wash
burn, who was playing fullback last
week, returns to center half. Doug
Kennedy makes up the third of this
trio.
The forward wall lined up pre- i
I cisely as it did in the latter stages

of the San Mateo game, with Rojas
playing outside right, Johnson, in
side right, Hearn, center forward,
Velarde, inside left, and Knecht,
outside left.
Newman Goalie
Milt Newman was installed as first
string goalie last night, now that
Brekelbaum is back at fullback, and
the former frosh justified his stand
ing by making several good stops,
including one of Gas Rojas's penalty
kicks.
After Maloney got through with
the varsity last night, he brought
Buster Holmes' frosh on the field
and scrimmaged them with the var
sity seconds. The two teams played
until after dark, with the score end
ing in a 1-1 deadlock.
