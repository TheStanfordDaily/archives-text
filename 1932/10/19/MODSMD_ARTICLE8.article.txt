# WARNER NAMES OPENING SQUAD FOR S.C. GAME
## Jay Tod Tosses Coin With Bill Doub; Wins Right End Starting Post LABORDE WILL START Bill Bates Will Be Acting Captain Saturday 
### 
First and second-string grid stars
fought it out so hard to see who
would start in Saturday's Trojan
contest that in one position, right
end, Pop Warner had to resort to
the toss of a coin to see who would
begin. Jay Tod, scrappy wingman
who was put out of commission in
last year's U.S.C. game, was the
winner and Bill Doub the loser.
The balance of the lineup is the
same that started against Santa
Clara. And it includes Here La-
Borde at right tackle who up until
yesterday had been hobbling around
on crutches. The complete eleven
with Bill Bates as acting captain is
as follows:

IVlaentz Absent
A quick glance at this starting
I eleven reveals that with the excep
j tion of Bob Maentz, who has not
j played for three weeks, it is intact,
j Gordy Campbell and Ernie Caddel,
! brains and spark plug of the Indian
backfield quartet, and Bill Bates and
Here Laßorde, stalwarts of the for
! ward wall, were all on the doubtful
list before the beginning of the
week. But with the return of all
of these erstwhile cripples the
strongest Stanford team since 1928
! will await the invasion of an under
! rated but undefeated Trojan out-
I fit Saturday.
Bates Captain
Warner's selection of Bill Bates
as captain was probably due to the
excellent generalship shown by the
Card center when he acted in the
| same capacity against Oregon State
at Portland. Press comments from
| the Oregon city • intimated that
! Bates hounded the officials on about
I every other play.
Besides being able to start his
j regular eleven, Warner will also be
I able to rely upon a formidable ar
j ray of reserve material. The greater
I part of this strength was uncovered
j only last week in the Army tilt,
j Thus Card fans may see perform
! ances again this week by Targhetta,
j Van Dellen, Afflerbaugh, White, and
j Anderson.
Behind closed gates the Old Fox
j sent his warriors through a long
j but easy practice session last night.
The squad was on the field for about
| two hours running signals and per
{ fecting timing. There will probably
j be no heavy workouts this week.

Confident that his line is the
strongest possible and will probably
be capable of holding the Indian
attack. Howard Jones began prepa
ration for the Card-Trojan tussle
by reorganizing his backfield which
so far has not shown the class of
last year's quartet.
With the return of Dick Barber to
the Trojan fullback berth, Jones
shifted Griffith back to center. Bar
ber has recovered from a knee in
jury. The balance of the backfield
will consist of Clark and either
Clemens or Erskine at halves with
Mohler in reserve provided he re
covers from a slight cold he is now
nursing.

contest that in one position, right
end, Pop Warner had to resort to
the toss of a coin to see who would
begin. Jay Tod, scrappy wingman
who was put out of commission in
last year's U.S.C. game, was the
winner and Bill Doub the loser.
The balance of the lineup is the
same that started against Santa
Clara. And it includes Here La-
Borde at right tackle who up until
yesterday had been hobbling around
on crutches. The complete eleven
with Bill Bates as acting captain is
as follows:

IVlaentz Absent
A quick glance at this starting
I eleven reveals that with the excep
j tion of Bob Maentz, who has not
j played for three weeks, it is intact,
j Gordy Campbell and Ernie Caddel,
! brains and spark plug of the Indian
backfield quartet, and Bill Bates and
Here Laßorde, stalwarts of the for
! ward wall, were all on the doubtful
list before the beginning of the
week. But with the return of all
of these erstwhile cripples the
strongest Stanford team since 1928
! will await the invasion of an under
! rated but undefeated Trojan out-
I fit Saturday.
Bates Captain
Warner's selection of Bill Bates
as captain was probably due to the
excellent generalship shown by the
Card center when he acted in the
| same capacity against Oregon State
at Portland. Press comments from
| the Oregon city • intimated that
! Bates hounded the officials on about
I every other play.
Besides being able to start his
j regular eleven, Warner will also be
I able to rely upon a formidable ar
j ray of reserve material. The greater
I part of this strength was uncovered
j only last week in the Army tilt,
j Thus Card fans may see perform
! ances again this week by Targhetta,
j Van Dellen, Afflerbaugh, White, and
j Anderson.
Behind closed gates the Old Fox
j sent his warriors through a long
j but easy practice session last night.
The squad was on the field for about
| two hours running signals and per
{ fecting timing. There will probably
j be no heavy workouts this week.

Confident that his line is the
strongest possible and will probably
be capable of holding the Indian
attack. Howard Jones began prepa
ration for the Card-Trojan tussle
by reorganizing his backfield which
so far has not shown the class of
last year's quartet.
With the return of Dick Barber to
the Trojan fullback berth, Jones
shifted Griffith back to center. Bar
ber has recovered from a knee in
jury. The balance of the backfield
will consist of Clark and either
Clemens or Erskine at halves with
Mohler in reserve provided he re
covers from a slight cold he is now
nursing.
First and second-string grid stars
fought it out so hard to see who
would start in Saturday's Trojan
contest that in one position, right
end, Pop Warner had to resort to
the toss of a coin to see who would
begin. Jay Tod, scrappy wingman
