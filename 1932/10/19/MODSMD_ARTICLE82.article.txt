Sensational runs, surprising aerial

day afternoon. The men from Alpha
Delta Phi took the Fiji's down the
line in a 14-0 victory, the Delta
Upsilon grid squad failed to make
good a last-minute thrust and lost
to Theta Chi 9-6, and Phi Delta Phi
nosed out the Japanese Club 7-6.
Skirting left end in scrimmage

sprinted 50 yards for the first touch
down in the game against the Fiji's.
Chick Lee drop-kicked for the extra
point. A 10-yard pass heaved by
Smith to Dick Miles, a 10-yard run,
and a touchdown was the order of
the process which tallied the second
six points for the men from Alpha
Delta Phi. Lee put his punting toe
into operation again and lifted the
ball over the cross bar for the
fourteenth point.
Hitchcock Good
John Hitchcock played a note
worthy game in the line for the
Fiji's, while Jack Hoerner took
honors in the backfield.
The opening kick-off spoiled dis
aster for the D.U. outfit in the game
against Theta Chi. The ball bounced
out of the receiver's hands and
bounded over the goal line where
a Theta Chi man made a safety.
Falling on a fumbled ball on the
Theta Chi 15-yard line, the men
from Delta Upsilon started a short
drive to a touchdown. Jerry Peters
ran around end for seven yards and
six points. Gordy White failed to
tally the extra point.
Home Scores
Bill Howe in the early part of the
second half sprinted 52 yards to a
touchdown for Theta Chi. Dick
Henderson annexed the conversion
point on a pass from Howe. Delta
Upsilon moved into a strong of
fensive in the last minutes of play,
gained a position on the Theta Chi
six-yard line, then lost the ball on
downs.
Snagging a short pass after the
Phi Delta Phi squad had reached
the Japanese Club scoring zone,
Warner Edmonds scored for the law
team. A pass from Charlie Teague
to Edmonds tallied the extra point.
During the first half Ito from the
Japanese outfit chalked up the six
points for the club team. The try for
conversion failed.
