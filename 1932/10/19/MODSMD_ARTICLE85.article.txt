# STANFORD BACKS SHOWING SPEED IN WORKOUTS FOR U.S.C. FRACAS
## 
### Bob Letts 
"As the line functions, so does
| the backfield," say the bleacher
I coaches.
But it's a reversable quotation. If
! you doubt it, watch Ernie Caddel,
Bill Sim, Kenny Afflerbaugh, Buck
Van Dellen, and Tommy Lambert
this Saturday when Stanford battles
University of Southern California.
Good Blocker
i Watch Sim's work particularly
j when Caddel booms through leit
j tackle on a reverse play. His deadly
j blocking has been the best part of
| his versatility.
After battling largely on his own
' for two seasons, Caddel has finally
I been able to show his speed and
| power, and it's due to the develop
j ment of a well-coached backfield
! that lends him the assistance he de
| serves.
8 Yards Per Play
Afflerbaugh and Van Dellen defi
i nitely demonstrated their worth as
j ground-gainers last Saturday against
j West Coast Army. Both averaged 8
I yards per play, which was plenty
good even against the Jarheads.
Another halfback. "Chuck" White,
also did creditable work, and should
j be ready in case of necessity.
The smallest man on the Stanford
I squad, Tommy Lambert, is almost
j certain to play against the Trojans.
! His charley horse no longer an an
! noyance, Lambert is set to show the
i Southerners that lti2 pounds can do
! damage. He does one thing better
' tha nany Stanford halfback—follow
I his interference.
Card Fullbacks Set
Jack Hillman, Phil Baker, Wes
! Stevens, and Stan Anderson. That';;
the array of fullbacks Warner has
! to offer. Hillman, of course, leads

I the pack.
Hillman holds a big edge in de
i fensive work, followed by Baker.
I The latter, incidentally, has football
j brains and can be worked in as a
I substitute quarterback.
The return of Gordy Campbell
I after two weeks' incapacitation is
j hailed by Cardinal followers as a
| real increase in Stanford's possibili
j ties to win. Campbell's knee is bet
| ter, and he will probably be able to
carry the pigskin if Pop's plans call
for it.
j
Allen Improves
Ed Walker and Dusty Allen are
okeh. Allen has come along nicely
■of late. Dusty's passing is getting
better.
Walker appeared erratic last Sat
i urday. It. may have been an off day,
t but he needs all the seasoning he
1 can get.
The thing we've been trying to
j say is tha* the Mohlers, Warburtons,
! Griffiths et al will have to flash
Saturday to get in the same picture
' with what Pop has to offer.

Card Fullbacks Set
Jack Hillman, Phil Baker, Wes

the array of fullbacks Warner has

I the pack.
Hillman holds a big edge in de
i fensive work, followed by Baker.
I The latter, incidentally, has football
j brains and can be worked in as a
I substitute quarterback.
The return of Gordy Campbell
I after two weeks' incapacitation is
j hailed by Cardinal followers as a
| real increase in Stanford's possibili
j ties to win. Campbell's knee is bet
| ter, and he will probably be able to
carry the pigskin if Pop's plans call
for it.

Allen Improves
Ed Walker and Dusty Allen are
okeh. Allen has come along nicely
■of late. Dusty's passing is getting
better.
Walker appeared erratic last Sat
i urday. It. may have been an off day,
t but he needs all the seasoning he
1 can get.
The thing we've been trying to
j say is tha* the Mohlers, Warburtons,
! Griffiths et al will have to flash
Saturday to get in the same picture
' with what Pop has to offer.
"As the line functions, so does
| the backfield," say the bleacher
I coaches.
But it's a reversable quotation. If
! you doubt it, watch Ernie Caddel,
Bill Sim, Kenny Afflerbaugh, Buck
Van Dellen, and Tommy Lambert
this Saturday when Stanford battles
University of Southern California.
Good Blocker
i Watch Sim's work particularly
j when Caddel booms through leit
j tackle on a reverse play. His deadly
j blocking has been the best part of
| his versatility.
After battling largely on his own
' for two seasons, Caddel has finally
I been able to show his speed and
| power, and it's due to the develop
j ment of a well-coached backfield
! that lends him the assistance he de
| serves.
8 Yards Per Play
Afflerbaugh and Van Dellen defi
i nitely demonstrated their worth as
j ground-gainers last Saturday against
j West Coast Army. Both averaged 8
I yards per play, which was plenty
good even against the Jarheads.
Another halfback. "Chuck" White,
also did creditable work, and should
j be ready in case of necessity.
The smallest man on the Stanford
I squad, Tommy Lambert, is almost
j certain to play against the Trojans.
