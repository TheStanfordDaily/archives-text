Desert air is wet
... by comparison!
Making telephone equipment presents many
an interesting problem to the engineers of Western
Electric—manufacturer for the Hell System.
A case in point is the drying of telephone cable
before putting on the protective lead sheath. This
step is of utmost importance, for the tiny copper
wires cannot carry your voice properly unless their
paper insulation is thoroughly dried. To this end,
Western Electric engineers devised special drying
ovens in which the air is thirty times drier than
desert air!
The same ingenuity and thoroughness go into
every step of making cable, telephones, switch
boards and many other kinds of telephone equip
ment. The dependable apparatus that results is
one reason why Bell System service is dependable.
