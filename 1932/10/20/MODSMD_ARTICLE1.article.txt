# "POP" WARNER HONORED GUEST AT VICTORY HOP
## Only 59 Bids Remain At $ 1 For Cabaret Dance After S.C. Game DANCE STUDIO SCENE Brilliant Talent To Offer Stage Show 
### 
Furthering its football theme, the
All-University Victory Dance this
Saturday night at. 8:30 o'clock will
feature in addition to Coach "Pop"
Warner and Ernie Nevers, All-Coast
Guard Bill Corbus and other stars
of the varsity.
Put on sale yesterday, there were
only 59 bids left at the A.S.S.U. of
fice in the Old Union last night.
The rapidity with which ducats
were sold surprised even the enthu
siastic committee which had planned
to announce the dance over the
public address system at the U.S.C.
game this Saturday. Obviously, this
will not be necessary under the
present selling schedule.
When the full program for the af
fair Saturday night after the game
became known to the campus yes
terday, misunderstandings about the
price became rampant. The com
mittee wishes to re-state that the
price is still one dollar per couple
and not two-iifty as the rumor had
it yesterday afternoon.
Bids Sell Fast
The usual sale of bids is attributed
variously to several factors. One of
the most important is no doubt that
the dance is limited exclusively to
Stanford people and their friends.
Another is the assurance that roughs
will not be admitted.
Startling interest is also being evi
denced in the brilliant array of tal
ent that has been arranged for en
tertainment. Eph Engelman, as mas
ter of ceremonies, will have the
pleasant task of introducing charm
ing Junior Opera star, Mary Anita
Loos —Fred Pearman and Adelaide
Kelly, tap dancers — and Winsted
Weaver, comedian. In addition two
Columbia Broadcasting System art
ists will be featured.
Hewlett Surprised
Chairman Marion Hewlett was
frankly surprised by the first day
sale. Contacted last night, she said:
"I expected that with a fine band,
free refreshments, ample entertain
ment, and with the tariff at one
dollar per couple, bids would sell
fast. Yesterday's sale, however, ex
ceeded any expectations. With only
. r )9 bids left at the A.S.S.U. office, the
succcss of the dance is assured."
Heche Furnishes Music
Music will be furnished by the
Royal Cardinals and for those who
tire of dancing, bridge tables have
been arranged at no extra fee. The
dance will be given at the Dance
Studio of the Women's Gym and not
at the Woman's Clubhouse as first
thought.
Bids are on sale at the A.S.S.U
office in the Old Union at one dollar
per couple. Stanford students must
purchase bids in advance for any
guests from the South who are plan
ning to attend.

guests from the South who are plan
ning to attend.
Furthering its football theme, the
All-University Victory Dance this
Saturday night at. 8:30 o'clock will
feature in addition to Coach "Pop"
Warner and Ernie Nevers, All-Coast
Guard Bill Corbus and other stars
of the varsity.
Put on sale yesterday, there were
only 59 bids left at the A.S.S.U. of
fice in the Old Union last night.
The rapidity with which ducats
were sold surprised even the enthu
siastic committee which had planned
to announce the dance over the
public address system at the U.S.C.
game this Saturday. Obviously, this
will not be necessary under the
present selling schedule.
When the full program for the af
fair Saturday night after the game
became known to the campus yes
terday, misunderstandings about the
price became rampant. The com
mittee wishes to re-state that the
price is still one dollar per couple
and not two-iifty as the rumor had
it yesterday afternoon.
Bids Sell Fast
The usual sale of bids is attributed
variously to several factors. One of
the most important is no doubt that
the dance is limited exclusively to
Stanford people and their friends.
Another is the assurance that roughs
will not be admitted.
Startling interest is also being evi
denced in the brilliant array of tal
ent that has been arranged for en
tertainment. Eph Engelman, as mas
ter of ceremonies, will have the
pleasant task of introducing charm
ing Junior Opera star, Mary Anita
Loos —Fred Pearman and Adelaide
Kelly, tap dancers — and Winsted
Weaver, comedian. In addition two
Columbia Broadcasting System art
ists will be featured.
Hewlett Surprised
Chairman Marion Hewlett was
frankly surprised by the first day
sale. Contacted last night, she said:
"I expected that with a fine band,
free refreshments, ample entertain
ment, and with the tariff at one
dollar per couple, bids would sell
fast. Yesterday's sale, however, ex
ceeded any expectations. With only
. r )9 bids left at the A.S.S.U. office, the
succcss of the dance is assured."
Heche Furnishes Music
Music will be furnished by the
Royal Cardinals and for those who
tire of dancing, bridge tables have
been arranged at no extra fee. The
dance will be given at the Dance
Studio of the Women's Gym and not
at the Woman's Clubhouse as first
thought.
Bids are on sale at the A.S.S.U
office in the Old Union at one dollar
per couple. Stanford students must
purchase bids in advance for any
guests from the South who are plan
ning to attend.
