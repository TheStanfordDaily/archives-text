# ROLPH RECALL DEMANDED BY FARM GROUPS
## Grange Assails Governor In New Cattle Fund Graft Charges 
### 
The San Francisco Chronicle this
morning carries a bitter tirade of
charges loosed against Governor
James Rolph and his administra
tion by the agriculturists of Cali
fornia, through their spokesman in
the State Grange meeting at Fresno
yesterday.
Demanding that the Grange in
stitute a recall movement against
the Governor, and asking for a
Senate committee to look into all
phases of the State government, the
agriculturists took a swat likewise
at Dudley Moulton, charging "grave
irregularities" in the State Depart
ment of Agriculture, which he
heads.
Moulton Called to Account
Another resolution demanded that
Moulton account for a $1,000,000
fund under his direction voted to
the State and Federal governments
to reimburse cattle men for cows
and sheep condemned under the
tuberculosis control laws. It was
charged that "many farmers are
still waiting for their money," al
though their cattle had long since
been destroyed.
Although the Grange was in
closed meeting, and George Sehl
meyer, master, refused to be quoted
until the end of the session, there
were other grangers who spoke
freely.
Thinks Shake-up Over
The attack on Moulton put a new
face on the charges and counter
charges that have been flying in
Rolph's cabinet since the recent dis
missal of two officers.
Governor Rolph thinks the shake
up in his official family is over. He
was apparently a tired man when
he arrived at the State Building
from Santa Barbara for a fifteen
minute stay before leaving again to
lay a cornerstone of a new $655,000
veterans' hospital at Yountville. He
was unusually uncommunicative.
Although he did not order Roland
R. Vandergrift, director of finance,
to audit the books of Charles G.
Johnson, state treasurer, he said
Vandegrift had a perfect right to
do so.
