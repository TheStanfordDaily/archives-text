# FULL SESSION OF DEBATING FACES CARDS
## Pre-Election Politics Hold Center Of Interest In Early Meetings 
### 
By Ronald Chinn
j That same enthusiasm over politi
j cal issues which pervades the cam-
I pus during these pre-election days,
I has pepped up the Stanford debate
(squad until Coaches William Haw
j ley Davis and Leland Chapin are
1 now looking forward to a highly
successful season. This year's squad
is the largest in Stanford history,
with nearly GO members.
"Until after election day the bone
of contention will be the question,
"Resolved, that the present national
administration should be returned to
| power." With that to fight over, the
j squad has developed intense ri
j valry for the chance to represent
j Ihe Farm in encounters with both
| the U.C. and Saint Mary's teams on
! November 2, and with the Trojan
j orators on November 7, the night
j before election.
There also looms the possibility
j that the Indian squad may clash
I with the University of San Fran
; cisco in the Scottish Rite Audi
| torium in San Francisco. John
| Gange, debate manager, has not
i been able to complete arrangements,
! but hopes to hold this debate on
j election night also. If this match is
| arranged, a chance to speak in it is
] the "plum" for which all squad
i members will strive.
To Announce Lineup
Early next week the coaches ex
j pect to announce the Stanford line
jup in these pre-election debates.
I Outstanding contenders for the
| honor are Leonard Bloom, Wayne
j Bannister, and Joseph Wolfe, all
| seasoned orators. Others who have
j a good chance to participate are
I Robert Grantier, Ronald Kay, Wil
■ Ham Kaye, John King, Albert Cook,
Franklin Gilchrist, Ray Wilbur, Jr.,
| Ronald Chinn, Bromley Smith,
| Reginald Partridge, and several
j others.
Tuesday evening a group under
the coaching of Davis will match
wits with another section of the
squad working under Chapin, to de
cide who will be the big guns of
the Stanford attack.
Use Split Teams
; The Bear and Trojan contests are
j both major debates of the year. The
former will consist of one debate
j at Berkeley and one here, on the
i same night. Two of the Indian
i speakers must join with one Cali-
I fornia man on the affirmative of the
i question here, while a third Stan
j ford man will join with the remain-
I ing two visitors to uphold the nega
i tive side. At Berkeley the teams
I will split in the opposite manner.
I This is made necessary by the Uni
-1 versity's ruling that these debates
i must be between split teams,
j In the U.S.C. encounter, only two
| men will compose each team, which
must also be split. The Trojans will
j journey to the Farm. The Indian
: orators whom Coach Davis picks to
; scalp the Galloping Gaels will have
'to journey to St. Mary's, where they
| will meet an opposing team from
j California, as well as one of St.
; Mary's, in a triangular affair. Stan
i ford will there uphold the adminis
j tration of her alumnus, Herbert
Hoover.
The squad has even taken an in-
I creased interest in debate arrange
ments. At the Tuesday meeting the
i members voted to request John
Gange, debate manager, to appear
before them once a week and in
| form them of his plans for future
! contests.

i speakers must join with one Cali-

I This is made necessary by the Uni
-1 versity's ruling that these debates
i must be between split teams,
j In the U.S.C. encounter, only two

must also be split. The Trojans will
j journey to the Farm. The Indian

; scalp the Galloping Gaels will have
'to journey to St. Mary's, where they

j California, as well as one of St.
; Mary's, in a triangular affair. Stan
i ford will there uphold the adminis

The squad has even taken an in-
