# Griff Williams Prefers A. B. to Broadway Fame
## 
### CHARLES CLANCY 
Possible Broadway musical suc
cessâ€”or a university degree?
This was the problem Griffon
Williams, senior student at Stanford,
was forced to consider. He chose to
return to his studies for one more
quarter, and earn his A.B. in bio
logical sciences while Anson Weeks
and his orchestra went East to fill
a three months' engagement at the
Hotel St. Regis in New York.
A year ago last summer "Griff"
was playing at the Feather River
Inn when he was offered a tempor
ary position at Hotel Mark Hopkins
in San Francisco while Weeks went

| on a short vacation. Williams was
so successful that Anson decided he
couldn't get along without him; so
"Griff" stayed with ihe band. Wil
liams i.s an accomplished pianist and
was a valuable addition to the band.
During his stay at the Mark Hop
j kins "Griff" composed several num
bers including "Dream Music," "50-
50 Love," and "Another Day." He
also assisted Weeks in arranging
j popular music for the orchestra.
This winter, after Williams has
the sheepskin safely slowed away,
'he may again join the orchestra
! when il returns to San Francisco.
