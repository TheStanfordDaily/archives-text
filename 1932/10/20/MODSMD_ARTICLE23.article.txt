# We'll Beat S.C., Not Hold Them, Says Bill Bates
## 'Pop' Warner, Ernie Nevers Speak At S.C. Rally 
### 
"WE'RE NOT just going to hold
U.S.C. Saturday, but we're going to
BEAT 'em!" This from Bill Bates,
acting captain of the varsity for the
Trojan game, last night at the gi
gantic rally in the Pavilion.
"We've got the best team spirit
we've ever had! Whether we win or
lose, every man will have given ev
ery bit he possibly could." And thus
did Stanford's wily "Pop" of the
gridiron beam proudly over his
"youngsters" when asked to address
the cheering throngs.
"If the ROOTING SECTION will
have as much spirit as the TEAM
HAS NOW, Stanford will beat
Southern Cal! We have a great
team and have an even chance to
win." And the blond giant, Ernie
Nevers, one who ought to know,
added what he thought of the situa
tion.
The Farm went wild for an hour
last night, when at 7 o'clock the
campus fire outfit went into action
with sirens screaming up and down
the Row as the long torch-light pa
rade got under way.
The rally was short, peppy and
full of real Stanford spirit. Things
were not allowed to lag even once.
And the ovation given Glenn War
ner and his boys far surpassed any
in recent seasons.
A riotous skit of fun and hilarity
was presented by Winsted Weaver
and a gang of rah-rah college boys
from a school in Southern Califor
nia. "Doodles" Weaver took the part
of the local yell-king, the University
President, and the star football
player, Morville Ohhler. The root
ing section backed him up with
clever yells. Weaver wrote the skit.
"Pop" read a letter which he re
ceived from an "old friend from the
mountains" who advised once more
that he complete his thorough study
of this game called football. The
correspondent finished his missive
with a suggestion for a slogan: "Let
every man get down to the game on
the spot and let the game wax hot!"
"And," says Mr. Warner, "the
game will wax hot!"
