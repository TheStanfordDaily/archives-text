# Passing Attack To Be Feature Of Trojan Game
## Both Mentors Plan to Spring Surprise Aerial Plays; Jones Concentrates on Speed; "Pop" Drills on Defense; Orv Miller May Not Play 
### DICK RODDA 
AN FORD'S 1932 aerial attack has not as yet been exposed. A few
straight forward passes with an end or fullback as receiver have l>een
attempted without much success, but thus far the Card complicated for
wards and laterals have not had to he used.

But from all indications that have seeped through the practice field,
Saturday's contest will see a Card hackficld tossing the pigskin around
as if it were a basketball. Laterals, short screen passes, and long forwards
that were revealed last year in several pre-Trojan games will he executed
quite frequently. To make things even more complicated, it is expected
also that the Trojan backlield will open up with a few air surprises*
Without such husky interfererers as Pinckert and Shaver, Howard
Jones has been forced to depend upon speed rather than power in his
attack. This of course involves greater use of the forward pass. With

outfits resorting to the air the
I coming tilt looms even more spcc
! tacular than previous Indian-Trojan
I battles.
Drill on Defense
Last night's practice consisted of
i the usual signal drill, but half of
i the evening was devoted to defense.
! Here Laborde, scheduled to open
!at right tackle, took part in the
! workout and apparently showed
little effects from his injured knee.
! Laborde had discarded a knee brace
but had his leg tightly taped.
This week's practice has been
conducted without the assistance of
Line Coach Tiny Thornhill. Thorn
hill has been confined to his home
; since Monday with a slight attack
! of flu but is expected to be on the
j field again tomorrow. At least he
v/ill be able to be on the bench at
, Saturday's kickoff.
Fundamentals Strong
Latest developments from the
I Southern California grid camp are
: that there is a remote possibility
i that Orv Mohler, slippery quartcr
i back, will not be able to play. Moh
j ler has been absent from practice
jbecause of a severe cold and the
j team physician has not as yet as
j sured Jones that he v/ill be able to
j use him. Whether Mohler is ready
'or not Jones will use Griffith to
start the signal-calling and send in
Orv after he has analyzed the Card
defense.
An advantage that this year's In
dian outfit has over the 1931 squad
which will be of special value
against the Trojans is a better
knowledge of fundamentals. Tack
ling, blocking, and clipping by the
Stanford line has been noticeably
impressive. The backfield has also
been functioning well in fundament
als. With such an improvement the
Cards will be able forget their
weight disadvantage.
Tactics Undecided
As to just what defensive tactics
Warner will use against Troy this
year, it would be difficult to say,
but it is a good guess that the Old
Fox has been spending much time
tightening up on the Card aerial
defense. It didn't look so hot last,
week in the Army game. The sol
diers were able to complete passes
almost at will except when they
were within scoring distance.
