# "TROJANS SHOULD BE EXTENDED"
## 
### 
Well, well, Hie Daily Trojan has finally recognized the
fact 111;11 (here is going lo he a football game at Stanford
Stadium this Saturday, Up here around the Hay, fans have
been rather inclined to become excited about the annual
clash between the Indians and the Thundering Herd (the I
National Champions, if you please). Hut down in the j
shadows of the Olympic Stadium contemporary journal-:
islic comment a tors have remained adamant, even apa
thetic.
Xot until Tuesday morning did the Daili/ Trojan's edi
tors take up this little matter of the game in the editorial
columns. And then their chief concern was over the small
sale of rooters' tickets: "Southern California has always
had the reputation of backing its athletic teams and it
would be a poor policy to fall down. . . ." The editors, of
course, ascribe this poor sale of tickets (300 to men, and
200 to women) to lack of cash, not seeming to realize that
Trojan rooters most likely got the big thrill of the season
in watching their varsity eke out a (>-0 win from little
Loyola last Saturday, and that all football thereafter will
be mere anticlimax.
Oh, yes, the game itself the Trojan edit writer didn't
forget to mention that, in his last line. "The game will be ,
one of the season's highlights and should extend the Tro
jans lo the limit," he said, and probably yawned. St an- j 1
ford, of course, is supposed to be flattered. The Indians ,
.are getting up in the world. In a year or two perhaps
they'll rate right up with Loyola and Utah and some of
the other "big boys" on the S.C. schedule.
