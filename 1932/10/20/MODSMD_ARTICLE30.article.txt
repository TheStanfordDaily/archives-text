Owing to a recent interpretation of the student pro

at Stanford can earn their way through college. \o matter
how small the job might be it is not available to the foreign
students if they receive any money for their work.
The tremendous stupidity of this law is made doubly
plain when it is known that not more than 2,;">()() positions
in the whole country would be affected by this new ruling.
I he loss of international goodwill alone should have been
enough to prevent the enforcement of Secretary of Labor
I )oak"s new Jirain child.
Besides the international element there is the imme
diate problem of individuals here at Stanford. One of the
main points in the founding grant of the I niversity was
thai there should be ;i certain definite number of places
open to foreign students. The spirit of the founders was
to encourage men and women from other lands to come
and study on this campus. The results of the past vears
have surpassed (tie fondest hopes of the most rabid sup
porter of the movement. Foreign students at Stanford have
made good in their chosen fields and have spread the name
of the I niversity far and wide.
Are we going to be forced to turn away brilliant
scholars because they don't have sufficient funds to go
through college without earning part of their expenses or
will those in authority exert their influence to have this
ridiculously unfair law changed? If someone should try
to help the foreign members of this university by employ
ing them regardless of the law, the student so engaged
would be liable to line and imprisonment. Die lu/'l dcr
