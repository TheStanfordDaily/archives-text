In the adjoining Campus Opinion column, Mary-Kath
crine Morris, president of A.W.S., further explains the
action of Conference when if passed a recommendation
that women refrain from smoking in rooting sections.
I hough the Daiiy was originally correct in every detail
in its story of Miss Morris' original interpretation, it hereby
acknowledges that the wording of a sub-headline was in
error, since it stated that "House presidents went beyond
authority,' when in fact the house presidents were simply
acting without the specified authority of their respective
groups.
