### POOF HOOVER 
To the foaming Democrat, "Poor
Hoover" implies a pitiful condition
of ihe executive office in this time
of unprecedented precedents and
uncomparable tncomparables. To the
equally-rabid Republicans "Poor
Hoover" implies the tough luck of
the man for failing to let A1 Smith
have the pleasure of having a nice
skinny depression climb up on his
knee and call him '"Daddy." Always
willing to add to the confusion of
any definition, "Poor Hoover" sug
gests to us something entirely dif
ferent.
Up in San Francisco, and prob
ably in other cities as well, there
are billboards depicting Hoover as
(he skipper of a ship. At the helm,
unblinkingly staring into the face
of the gale, resolutely stands Stan
lord's most famous alumnus. Geared
in a sou'wester and a muffler 'round
his throat stands the 33d President
of the United States—which fact is
forgotten—but there also stands the
Candidate for Re-election, which
fact is not forgotten by the Cam
paign Committee.

The board bears some label like
j "Don's Switch Pilots in the Middle j
of the Storm"—"Stand by Hoover j
in Rain or Cold"—or some such ;
! sentiment. Tne billboard is such a
i common form of advertising—and
; costuming a Presidential candidate
! seems so lacking in dignity—that it
does not take much imagination to :
see Herbert Hoover squirming in !
acute mental agony every time he !
passes one of those enlarged pla
cards.

It is in that sense that we use the 1

I term ' Poor Hoover." Here is a man
who seems to be cold and dignified
—who is ill at ease before a camera
like the average citizen—forced to
submit to this bunk and hokum. And
the pity isn't only on one side.
Franklin Roosevelt in his tour
through the West was forced many
! times to get up at four o'clock in
the morning just because some
| country yokels at a Gopher Prairie
junction wanted to see the candi
date.
Making an 8,000-mile trip in a
few weeks is tiring. Campaigning
over half of territorial United States
;is most exhausting. But had the
rumor got out that Roosevelt had
presumed to refuse to leave the
1 comfortable covers at dawn to greet
j the citizens of the nation—he would
have lost countless votes. During
j three years and nine months out of
I four, the mob gets about as much
consideration as it deserves but
suddenly the great equalizer—the
ballot—comes along, transforming
every Tom, Dick, and Jimmy to a
Mortimer, Alexander, and Hender
son.

Like, in the advertising of a mass
appeal cigarette, the people must be
I served. The billboard will probably
| ai dthe Republican cause. We fully
'■ expect Democratic news-reels in the
j very near future showing Roose
velt, in football regalia, smashing
the opposition wall of depression,
breaking uot into the open green of
: a bigger and better prosperity. Of
; course, the Democrats may be
forced to use better taste in adver
tising—due to lack of funds to ma
terialize all their ideas.

To the foaming Democrat, "Poor
Hoover" implies a pitiful condition
of ihe executive office in this time
of unprecedented precedents and
uncomparable tncomparables. To the
equally-rabid Republicans "Poor
Hoover" implies the tough luck of
the man for failing to let A1 Smith
have the pleasure of having a nice
skinny depression climb up on his
knee and call him '"Daddy." Always
willing to add to the confusion of
any definition, "Poor Hoover" sug
gests to us something entirely dif
ferent.
Up in San Francisco, and prob
ably in other cities as well, there
are billboards depicting Hoover as
(he skipper of a ship. At the helm,
unblinkingly staring into the face
of the gale, resolutely stands Stan
lord's most famous alumnus. Geared
in a sou'wester and a muffler 'round
his throat stands the 33d President
of the United States—which fact is
forgotten—but there also stands the
Candidate for Re-election, which
fact is not forgotten by the Cam
paign Committee.

The board bears some label like
j "Don's Switch Pilots in the Middle j
of the Storm"—"Stand by Hoover j
in Rain or Cold"—or some such ;
! sentiment. Tne billboard is such a
i common form of advertising—and
; costuming a Presidential candidate
! seems so lacking in dignity—that it
does not take much imagination to :
see Herbert Hoover squirming in !
acute mental agony every time he !
passes one of those enlarged pla
cards.

It is in that sense that we use the 1

I term ' Poor Hoover." Here is a man
who seems to be cold and dignified
—who is ill at ease before a camera
like the average citizen—forced to
submit to this bunk and hokum. And
the pity isn't only on one side.
Franklin Roosevelt in his tour
through the West was forced many
! times to get up at four o'clock in
the morning just because some
| country yokels at a Gopher Prairie
junction wanted to see the candi
date.
Making an 8,000-mile trip in a
few weeks is tiring. Campaigning
over half of territorial United States
;is most exhausting. But had the
rumor got out that Roosevelt had
presumed to refuse to leave the
1 comfortable covers at dawn to greet
j the citizens of the nation—he would
have lost countless votes. During
j three years and nine months out of
I four, the mob gets about as much
consideration as it deserves but
suddenly the great equalizer—the
ballot—comes along, transforming
every Tom, Dick, and Jimmy to a
Mortimer, Alexander, and Hender
son.

Like, in the advertising of a mass
appeal cigarette, the people must be
I served. The billboard will probably
| ai dthe Republican cause. We fully
'■ expect Democratic news-reels in the
j very near future showing Roose
velt, in football regalia, smashing
the opposition wall of depression,
breaking uot into the open green of
: a bigger and better prosperity. Of
; course, the Democrats may be
forced to use better taste in adver
tising—due to lack of funds to ma
