EMIL UNI) DIE DETECTIVE (UFA)
—At the Filmartc Theatre.
Those used to American kid pic
tures will find this a pleasant nov
elty, if remembrance of the home
p.-oduct does not frighten them
away. It is not a picture for over
sentimental adults, but one made
expressly for children. There is no
harping on the innocence, bliss,
carefree life, etc., which makes most
child pictures sloppy; nor does the
director move heaven and earth to
make the children sweet.
Emil, making his first trip to Ber
lin, has been given a sum of money
tc. deliver. The rest of the story can
be supposed to have occurred in his
mind, although the mistake of hav
ing everything end as a dream is
avoided.
He meets a villain with a mus
tache and a black derby who takes
(he money away; then, aided by a
small army of acquaintances he has
made, haunts the villain and even
tually recovers the money. The
imaginative quality of the story in
creases constantly; so very natural
ly, the villain becomes a notorious i
bandit. Emil is rewarded, flies home
in an airplane, and is greeted by a
public reception.
Excellent acting—not overacting—
by the whole cast contributes to
make this picture the best of its
type. The recording is clear, which
relieves the children from the neces
sity of speaking with unnatural dis- ]
tinctness. Such a subject as man
ners, emphasized in American child
pictures, is here taken for granted
and consequently seems natural.
And it is the extraordinary natural
ness of the picture which makes i1
succeed so well. —C.A.Z.

! A HILL OF DIVORCEMENT —
(Radio). At the Stanford.
I John Barrymore, Katherine Hep
! burn, and Billie Burke give fine per
formances in an exceptional film.
Barrymore discards the stage trick
ery of which he is so smooth a
j master and acts. Katherine Hep
j burn, thin, unbeautiful, but mag
, netic, varying tone but not inflec
| tion, makes a screen debut sincere
I and worthy. Billie Burke has, in
comparison to these players, little
to do; indecision, the dilemma which
comprises almost her entire role, is
difficult to do convincingly; it is
: sufficient to say that she succeeds'
i admirably.
j The picture is not one of general
j appeal; its situation is not unlike
I that of Ghosts and, to an unsyrrtpa
i thetic general audience, may seem
unconvincing. Handled as skilfully
; as it is, however, the film is one to
be appreciated by intelligent thea
; tregoers.
It has been said that the stage is :
|no place for discussion of sbcial
problems; but Clemence Dane's play !
jis good drama, not debate. Too.,it is
i superior in that it does not become
.sentimental—it. might, particularly
at the moment when Sydney sends
her lover away; but as handled by
Miss Hepburn and Barrymore, is
triumphant and, at the same time, j
fearfully poignant.
Tliis picture is the high point of |
l production from a studio too often
j satisfied with mediocrity.
Harry Browne, manager of the
Stanford, is featuring a special USC
| game diversion, "The Fall of Troy";
| it is simpie, but, with audience co
| operation, effective and amusing, a
j compliment to Browne's timeliness.
