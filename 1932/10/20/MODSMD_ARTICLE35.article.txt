Stanford DAILY averages rose
2.55 to close at 70.20 yesterday.
While volume continued small, near
ly all stocks joined in a firm upward
movement. Favorable reports in
cluded V 2% gain in steel operations,
decrease in oil output, increase in
power output and larger car load
ings of N.Y. Central and Pennsyl
vania.
Public sentiment toward the stock
market is slowly undergoing a
change. In 1929 it was enthusiastic;
the public was in the market, mak
ing money, and having one swell
time. Then the crash smashed all
that; the public, cleaned, yelled for
blood and a bomb for the Stock Ex
change. Public prints insinuated
that people should get down to busi
ness and forget about stocks and
bonds, bulls and bears, dividends
and melons. The public did neglect
the market, rather of necessity than
of choice. The market slid approxi
mately 85% off of 1929 highs. Eut
retail business was bum, real estate
was a drug on the market and gen
eral talk turned pessimistic. In July
of this year Wall Street prices
started upward. Business slowly
gained and people became more op
timistic. The public today admits
that as Wall Street prospers, so
prospers the land. It is the par ex
cellance barometer of the daily
bread business condition and out
look. It has demonstrated its verity
during the past three years. It has
a finality about it, Roma locuta,
causa finita.
