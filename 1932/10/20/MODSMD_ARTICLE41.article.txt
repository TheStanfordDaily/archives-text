i The Editor, Sir:
In view of the recent discussion
evoked by the action of A.W.S. Con- !
ference in recommending non-smok
ing in the women's rooting section i
during football games, it is thought '
advisable to define clearly the leg-
I islative procedure in women's stu
! dent government.
The Constitution of Associated
| Women Students states that Con- j
| ference shall "exercise the legisla
tive functions of self-government as
delegated to the Associated Women !
Students by the President of the 1
University and by A.S.S.U." This
means that by express constitu- j
j tional grant Conference possesses |
the power to enact legislation with
! out previous consultation with the
various living groups. However in
various living groups. However, in I
: ion in the past, the procedure on j
matters of sufficient importance has |
been to discuss them at Conference j
; meeting, refer them to similar dis- j
| cussion in the various living groups,
and then take final action at a sec
j ond meeting of Conference. This ,
procedure will be continued this i
year. In addition Conference in its 1
I capacitl as a legislative body pos
sesses the power of recommenda
tion. On October 12 Conference, act- j
ing under this power, voted unani- j
1 mously to recommend that Stanford •
j women refrain from smoking in the '■
; stadium stands.
The Stanford Daily of October 1$
; explained that the action of Con- i
; ference was not legislation but a rec- I
j ommendation, and as such its ob- j
i servance was a matter for the indi- i
,! vidual student to decide. It con- j
j tained however a misquotation that J
i j should be corrected. The phrase j
, "House Presidents Went Beyond ,
i/Authority—in passing this recom- '
emendation the house presidents
j were not acting with the authority {
of the groups they represent" is ob- 1
' viously inaccurate. Conference at all I
; times possesses the power to legis- !
late and to recommend. f

I should imagine that Pan-Hel

he, because him don't use the brand
' of English that appeals to she.
