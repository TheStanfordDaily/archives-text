# "DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY" OFFERS UNIQUE DRAMATIZATION OF SUPERNATURAL STORY
## 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
The legitimate stage has in recent I
years witnessed the rise to artistic j
prominence of a new type of seri- j
ous drama â€”the sensitive, psycho- :
logical drama of the supernatural.
Philip Barry's "Hotel Universe" will
be remembered as the first of these j
plays, and an even greater popular
and artistic success was achieved by I
"Berkeley Square." Equally impor
tant, is "Death Takes A Holiday," i
which Harold Helvenston will pre
sent to Stanford audiences on Oc
tober 28.
"Death Takes A Holiday," as the
title suggests, tells a unique story,
and it is a deeply moving one. Death,
tired of his isolated existence, comes ,
to earth to take a three-day holiday
in search of human experiences and
emotions. He comes in the person
ol a human being, and how he finds I
human emotions is the subject of
the play. That even Death cannot
control all things is indicated when
he falls deeply in love with Grazia.
a lovely and sensitive young Italian
girl, a guest at the party where :
Death takes his holiday. '

I The three-day period encompassed j
in the action of the play sees many i
strange things take place, and all
! are influenced by the supernatural
guest. Nothing dies during this time;
many miraculous escapes from what j
seemed certain death take place; and
I every guest at the party feels the J
mystery of their visitor.
Like "Death Takes A Holiday," j
j "Berkeley Square," presented on the ,
j campus last fall, deals with two!
principal characters against a back
-1 ground of many minor but strong |
! characters. The present play again
| sees Vallejo Gantner in the leading j
: role, this time supported by Virginia j
Wilson. This play, however, is dis- j
! tinctly modern in setting, whereas;
the Balderston play turned back to |
the eighteenth century for its, prin
| cipal action.
"Hotel Universe," though modern, j
is vastly different from "Death ;
Takes A Holiday." The Barry play |
is also laid at a house party, and it !
tells the story of two principal char- j
acters, but in this instance the ro
: mantic element is rather more sub- i
' jected to the psychological.
