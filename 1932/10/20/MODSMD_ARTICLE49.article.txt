Saturday is the last possible day !

Peirce in Room 466 in the biology
department by that time.
This year the Stanford committee
will select four candidates from
among the applicants. One student
from Washington will be selected,
one from Oregon, and two from
California. The final choice from
these men will be made by the
Rhodes Scholarship committee for
the district, which consists of six ,
states.
A candidate to be eligible must |
be from 19 to 25 years of age and
unmarried. The winners are se- j
lected for scholastic ability, charac
ter, and physical vigor.
The stipend of a Rhodes Scholar
ship is Â£400 a year and the appoint
ment is made for two years. No re
striction is placed on the choice of
study.
Candidates for the honor are cho- !
sen from the eight districts of six j
states each. Out of the 12 men se- j
lected from the competition, only j
four may be chosen. Since 1905 this I
state has won 22 of the scholai*ships. j
