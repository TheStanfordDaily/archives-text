# BAWLOUT SHOWS CAMPUS AS WORLD MELTING POT
## 
### Russell Paine 
Stanford University is the melting
pot of the United States and a gath
ering place for students the world
over.
From forty states of the union,
exclusive of California, are regis
tered 661 scholars in the Bawlout.
To add to theme, twenty-three de
pendencies and countries have sent
ninety-one students to the Ameri
can college of their choice. Washing
ton, D.C., also sends two students.
Added to the 2438 California rep
resentation these make the total en
rollment of Stanford for the autumn
quarter, 1932, 3,190. These figures
show a drop of 300 from the enroll
ment of last year and also represen
tation from two less states. Even
so, it is an accomplishment seldom
equaled even in larger schools.
License plates have been seen
about the campus from many states.
Among them are those of Michigan,
Arizona, Washington, Oregon, New
York, Texas, Kansas, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, New Jersey, Colorado, New
Mexico, and Minnesota, as well as
Hawaii.

i Of the students from territories
I and foreign states, Hawaii ranks
j first with 25. China is second with
' 15, and Canada third with 12. Japan
i has nine; England, Philippine Is
lands, South America, three; and
Alaska, Central America, Dutch
East Indies, India, Mexico, two each.
One representative each has come
! from Australia, Bermuda, Cuba,
j Germany, Ireland, Korea, Liberia,
! Panama, Porto Rico, Spain, and
i Turkey.
Washington and Oregon are sec-
I ond and third, respectively, in the
United States, having 97 and 96
! Stanford students. Arizona, Idaho,
! Utah, Colorado, and Illinois are in
j the thirties, and fifteen other states
j have a Stanford representation of
more than ten.

Stanford University is the melting
pot of the United States and a gath
ering place for students the world
over.
From forty states of the union,
exclusive of California, are regis
tered 661 scholars in the Bawlout.
To add to theme, twenty-three de
pendencies and countries have sent
ninety-one students to the Ameri
can college of their choice. Washing
ton, D.C., also sends two students.
Added to the 2438 California rep
resentation these make the total en
rollment of Stanford for the autumn
quarter, 1932, 3,190. These figures
show a drop of 300 from the enroll
ment of last year and also represen
tation from two less states. Even
