A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN
Orville Mohler was in high
school, a bunch of youngsters
from Texas came out to Los An
geles to play a Southern Cali
fornia all-star high-school out
lit. 1 hat was the year that
Mohler scorcd 22 touchdowns
<ill by himself, and he was a
plenty sweet ball player.
The visitors heard all about what
a great runner Orv was, how he
handled the ball, what, he did to get
;ill his yardage, and built their at
tack to stop him. They were a fast
team, and they played tough foot
ball.
When the game finally rolled
around, Mohler stayed in his own
backfield and threw passes at his
ends and fellow backs until the
Texans began to think that they
had been badly misinformed.
And the object of all this pre
amble, leetle keeds, is that you had
better not put all your money on
the touchdowns Mohler will roll up
himself. He is not a single-threat
player, and although his kicking
can and is bettered almost every
Saturday, his passing is something
that cannot be overlooked. .
ON TIIEIR RECORD TIHS
SEASON so far, Troy's ends are
not on a par with the Card
wingmen, but Trojan ends have
a habit of going wild every time
they gel up against the Palo
Alto Indians, and spending the
better part of their afternoon in
tin* Cardinal backfield.
Palmer is said to be the best pass
receiver on the team, and Sparling
is remembered for his ground-gain
ing, end-around play, but v/e'll lay
a cookie on the line that neither of
them can pull down the leather
when an Indian doesn't want them
to.
They have some mighty sweet
substitutes battling these regulars
for the starting berth, too, and one
(jf them is a certain Johnny Seixas
who was slated to come to Stan
lord, until someone bawled up his
registration papers. Now he will see
what, he can do for ye bitter rivals.
UP AT WASHINGTON UNI
VERSITY, while everybody else
is preparing for a "crucial" with
someone or other, Coach Jimmie
Phelan sits and waits placidly
for the arrival of Navy Bill In
gram and his so-far toothless
Bears.
When he arrived three years ago,
Phelan brought with him a lot of
prep stars from the Middlewest,
and now look at his backfield—Matt
Muezynski, Paul Sulocksey, Beryl
Pufkin, Art Oberg, and Bill Ahonen
- if you don't think that he can
pick his stars by name.
He has to make good this year,
and it looks like he will do just that.
He has a tough line, and they are
always big in Seattle, a fast-charg
ing, hard-hitting backfield, and the
same deception with which he
coached Purdue's Boilermakers to
i. championship the year before he
came to Washington.
WITH A NUMBER OF SO-SO
games behind them, the boys
over at St. Mary's are beginning
to prick up their ears and think
about the national title that they
have been waiting for lo these
many years.
Last year the Marauders beat the
great Thundering Herd and then
went stale and lost to the Olympic
Club and U.C.L.A. The Bruins will
not admit that St. Mary's was stale,
but it is a fact nevertheless, and
Ihe Gaels are making sure that they
don't pull that again.
St. Mary's has a lot of tough
games coming down upon the team
beginning next week, and if they
can beat back the challenges of
Santa Clara, Fordham, and U.C.L.A.
they will have a legitimate claim to
the crown they have so far failed
to nail. —R.D.W.Jr.
