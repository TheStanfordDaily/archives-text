# Freshmen Doped Winners Over Menlo Saturday
## FROSH HAVE EDGE IN BACKFIELD AND LINE OVER RIVALS Babes Represent Pick Of Prep School Material; Envy Of Varsities 
### 
When the Stanford freshman grid- ;
ders meet Menlo Junior College 1
Saturday in a preliminary to the j
| U.S.C.-Stanford varsity game, they ;
! will face a team of about equal J
I strength to the San Mateo Junior j
| College eleven which they defeated i
j 18-0 earlier in the season.
If there is any edge either way, !
San Mateo is the stronger of the
two junior college teams. Menlo lost
to Marin Junior College 18-7, while
San Mateo was holding the Cali
fornia freshmen to a one-point vic
i tory.
j Although Stanford's advantage
over Menlo in line play is very dis
j tinct, the superiority of the Indian
backs is even more pronounced,
j There are few freshman teams in
j the country, nor many varsities, for
| that matter, with as good backfield ;
I material as Stanford's freshmen. We
i warrant Norwich, Albion, Spring- !
j field, and other Eastern colleges |
that are annually massacred at the j
| hands of the "big guns" of Eastern
football, would be glad to have j
Frank Alustiza, Bones Hamilton, j
Bobby Grayson, and Johnny Ries
ner ripping off long gains for them. :
Backs Equal Varsity's
Fpr that matter, there are not J
i more than three backs on the Stan- j
! ford or Southern California varsi- J
! ties having more "finish" than this :
| quartet. Reisner, altholgh he is still
j playing second string left halfback, '
I has been one of the surprises of the
yearling season. He was all-city |
' halfback at Commerce High in his
! freshman year. He also gained this j
rating in his sophomore season, but
in his junior and senior years he i
dropped to second-team recognition, j
Wiseacres of prep football said that
Riesner was "through." They |
j changed their minds, however, when
ihe ripped through the Taft Junior
College, San Mateo, Fresno State,
and U.C.L.A. lines for spectacular
gains.
Grayson has lived up to expecta
tions when those same wise ones
said he would be a flop in college :
football. Grayson was one of those j
prep-school heroes you read about j
when you still entertained dreams
of being an All-American some day.
He made more points in a single i
season than most high-school half-'
j backs made in their entire gridiron
j careers. But Grayson is working as
I hard for a place on the Stanford
! freshman team as if he were a green '
! and inexperienced player.
Hamilton Triple-Threat
Alustiza did his touchdowning for ;
| Stockton High, and he did it well. ;
i Hamilton was a triple-threat for j
j Kiskimentas. Hi 4 coach there said |
I Hamilton was the greatest prep-
I.school player he had ever seen.
Whether this Class of '36 line is
j any stronger than last year's year
: ling forward wall is problematical. I
j Ed Lettunch was assigned the work
of seven men in freshman games last J
year, but the big tackle never fell i
down on the job.
