# Clocks To Check Earth's Speed Changes Forecast
## 
### 
Clocks so perfect that they can
I detect the gradual slowing-up of the
jearth's rotation! A check on the
| length of each day will be possible
j it' precision clocks improve to that
extent, as predicted yesterday by
W. W. Hansen, instructor in physics,
at the department Journal Club.
The first point in building an ac
curate clock is to define a day, Han
sen said. A day commonly marks
one complete revolution of the
earth, he said.
But days are growing longer be-
I cause the earth is being restrained
by friction on the ocean bed, caused
by tides rushing over the earth.
There are also abrupt changes in
i earth speed for which the causes
are unknown. So the improved pre
i cision clock, according to Hansen,
may prove in checking the length
of a day, and indirectly gauge the
! dragging rate of the earth.
