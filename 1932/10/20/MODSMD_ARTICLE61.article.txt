# MITTMEN SHOW PEP, ABILITY IN PRELIM BOUTS; COACHES SEE EXCEPTIONAL TEAM
## 
### 
Hoping to uncover a middleweight I
in the Stanford novice boxing tour- J
nament, Coaches Harry Maloney i
and Myron Schall, as well as the j
campus at large, are particularly in- i
terested in the annual event for in- j
experienced and ambitious mittmen. j
The novice tournament will prob
ably be held the first week in De- !
cember.
Stanford this year may well be:
able to present the strongest of her i
many strong mitt squads, for the i
edification and amusement of the j
ring fans who save their money and'
get a better show anyway by at- j
tending the amateur intercollegiate j
bouts in preference to ballyhooed, i
but bum professional matches.
The pugilists who expect to wave j
the flag of bloody Stanford before !
their opponents next winter quarter j
have all been working out daily with !
unexpected vim and ferocity. In j
fact, the wear and tear on the four j
big bags is creating a serious prob- 1
lem for Coach Schall. !
The pep and enthusiasm of the
big and little boys is quite unprece
dented compared with the more or i
less lackadaisical attitude common
ly assumed by boxers a full quarter
before their meets start and their
names begin to appear in print. As
Coach Schall said this week, "We've
undoubtedly got the ability and we
apparently also have the spirit."
Fred Glover, incapacitated 1931
captain, has been perhaps the most
energetic in the daily Gluttonous j
Games of Gore. Glover has been I
knocking his fellow lightweights
around with no reverence for their
reputations or health, and he has
occasionally gone out of his class to '
cause some of the larger boxing gen
tlemen to thank the stars that they
saw when he hit them that he was ;
only a lightweight.
The "kayo a day" rccord of Keith
Topping is still intact, as this tall,
light-heavy has regularly created a
connection between his fist and some j
less skillful boxer's jaw or solar
plexus. Topping c;..i take it as well
as dish it out: he demonstrated the
former when he boxed with Schall
and Ed Dillen, former Card heavy- '

weight champ.
The team's two important addi
tions-by-transfer, Jim Feeley and
Waldo Mundy, are living up to ad
vance notices. John Huston has been
out there trying to take Fee ley's
129-pound post away from him, and
a newcomer by the name of Breed
may give Glover a battle.
"Yuji Imai, with a beautiful col
lection of bruises on his face, hasn't
found a featherweight who can beat
him. And Phil Smith expects to re
turn to school this winter quarter;
if he does not, Ben Palamountain
may box heavyweight.
The middleweight situation finds
Bill Lee, at present playing football,
as the outstanding man. Lee is in
experienced, and Jack Perego may
be the Stanford middleweight when
the team starts to throw gloves
against its oppinents.

Fred Glover, incapacitated 1931
captain, has been perhaps the most
energetic in the daily Gluttonous j
Games of Gore. Glover has been I
knocking his fellow lightweights
around with no reverence for their
reputations or health, and he has
occasionally gone out of his class to '
cause some of the larger boxing gen
tlemen to thank the stars that they
saw when he hit them that he was ;
only a lightweight.
The "kayo a day" rccord of Keith
Topping is still intact, as this tall,
light-heavy has regularly created a
connection between his fist and some j
less skillful boxer's jaw or solar
plexus. Topping c;..i take it as well
as dish it out: he demonstrated the
former when he boxed with Schall
and Ed Dillen, former Card heavy- '

weight champ.
The team's two important addi
tions-by-transfer, Jim Feeley and
Waldo Mundy, are living up to ad
vance notices. John Huston has been
out there trying to take Fee ley's
129-pound post away from him, and
a newcomer by the name of Breed
may give Glover a battle.
"Yuji Imai, with a beautiful col
lection of bruises on his face, hasn't
found a featherweight who can beat
him. And Phil Smith expects to re
turn to school this winter quarter;
if he does not, Ben Palamountain
may box heavyweight.
The middleweight situation finds
Bill Lee, at present playing football,
as the outstanding man. Lee is in
experienced, and Jack Perego may
be the Stanford middleweight when
the team starts to throw gloves
against its oppinents.

in the Stanford novice boxing tour- J
nament, Coaches Harry Maloney i
and Myron Schall, as well as the j
campus at large, are particularly in- i
terested in the annual event for in- j
experienced and ambitious mittmen. j
The novice tournament will prob
ably be held the first week in De- !
cember.
Stanford this year may well be:
able to present the strongest of her i
many strong mitt squads, for the i
edification and amusement of the j
ring fans who save their money and'
get a better show anyway by at- j
tending the amateur intercollegiate j
bouts in preference to ballyhooed, i
but bum professional matches.
The pugilists who expect to wave j
the flag of bloody Stanford before !
their opponents next winter quarter j
have all been working out daily with !
unexpected vim and ferocity. In j
fact, the wear and tear on the four j
big bags is creating a serious prob- 1
lem for Coach Schall. !
The pep and enthusiasm of the
big and little boys is quite unprece
dented compared with the more or i
less lackadaisical attitude common
ly assumed by boxers a full quarter
before their meets start and their
names begin to appear in print. As
Coach Schall said this week, "We've
undoubtedly got the ability and we
apparently also have the spirit."
