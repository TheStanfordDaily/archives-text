# S.C. GAME TO BE BATTLE OF TWO DEFENSE PLANS
## 
### 808 LETTS 
Those who congregate in Stanford
Stadium Saturday to watch Univer
sity of Southern California and the
Cards fight it out will witness two
football teams employing different
defenses.
While similar in some respects
(particularly their objectives), the
outstanding difference as explained
last night by Chief Scout John Bunn
is that the Trojans rely on a type of
line play which sees each man as
signed to fill one hole. The guards
never crash in, but set themselves
and slow up the charge.
Cards Go Through
In contrast, Stanford's Corbus and
Kite try to knife through and make
tackles behind the lineâ€”at the same
time leaving a hole where they were.
Which is the most logical? We'll
have to wait until Saturday to see.
Both teams' tackles are inclined
toward the crashing game, with nat
ural inclinations toward the waiting
game at times when "sucking in"
would mean their complete elimina
tion from the play. U.S.C. has two
of the Coast's best tackles in Cap
tain Tay Brown and Ernie Smith,
but Stanford's George Grey, Here
Laborde, Red Gribben, Chuck Rog
ers and Jack Holwerda should be
able to keep them in check.
Ends Are Experts
The ends at Stanford are the equal

j of any in the coast conference, Bunn
\ believes. Sparling and Palmer have
i played almost every minute of the
i four Trojan battles thus far, and the
- Cardinal scout hasn't been able to
i get much of a look at the reserve
I strength Coach Howard Jones is
supposed to have.
1 No one can deny the ability of
Colvin, Tod, and Doub. All are de
fensive experts and Colvin has been
labelled the man who "can catch one
J impossible pass a game."
The Trojan defense in the back
! field sees a guard coming out of the
j line, leaving the center in the front
I wall. The ends float back before
; the play starts, and, against a team
j that shifts, the man on the strong
: side comes up to the line, the other
I staying back partly to cover passes.
Troy 6-3-2 Defense
U.S.C. uses a 6-3-2 defense much
of the time, although Jones fits his
men to the opponent.
What Pop has been doing with his
! Cardinals this week is still a guess.
! He has had the gates closed since
i Monday, so what he has cooked up
' is still being cooked.
i One thing we can't overlook is the
i weight of the Southerners. They
| have it over Stanford by about 10
j pounds to the man from end to end.
I That can prove a deciding factor in
! 60 minutes of football.
i But we hope it won't.
