# Frosh Women Outclass Sophs In Hockey Match
## 
### 
Outplaying their sophomore op
ponents in every way, the freshman
W.A.A. hockey team walked away
with the victor's spoils yesterday af
ternoon in a practice game.
In spite of having had only two
weeks' experience as a team, the
yearlings exhibited more teamwork
and aggressiveness in one afternoon
than the sophs have in a whole year.
The latter played as individuals,
rather than as a machine, seeming
almost to make a point of not fol
lowing up each other's shots.
Especially outstanding on the
frosh team was Babs Stuart, at cen
ter forward, who played a game
with headwork and stickwork judi
ciously mixed. Helen Fulton, who
has made a name for herself in the
tennis world by winning the Nation
al Junior Women's Singles Cham
pionship, proved her versatility by
playing a strong and steady game at
center half, teaming with Babs
Stuart in a most effective manner.
Winifred Lemkau was elected
freshman manager following the
practice.
