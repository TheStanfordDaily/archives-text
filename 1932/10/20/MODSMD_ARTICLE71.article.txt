Two tie games and an extra pe- .
riod in each battle climaxed a se- j
lies of sensational plays in yester- j
day's touch football games of the i
first round in the intramural season, j
A pass and a 40-yard run brought j
El Toro a 8-0 triumph in the extra ;
period of the game against the grid j
squad from Kappa Alpha, and a liket
feat under like circumstances gave
the Alpha Sigs a 2-0 victory overl
El Campo. The men from Phi Delta
Theta piled up the greatest score |
made this year to win an easy 21-0 j
victory from the Theta Delts.
Opening the game with the K.A.'s, j
El Toro drove into enemy territory j
where Morris Oppenheim ran 20 j
yards from scrimmage for a touch- |
down. Up to the last five minutes j
of play the two teams see-sawed j
back and forth. Topping a power- ;
ful aerial attack brandished during j
the earlier part of the game, the i
squad from Kappa Alpha pulled a !
surprise in the little time that was i
left. Fred Wright, passer par-excel- j
lence, heaved a pass from mid-field j
to Harry Stark on the Toro goal line •
for the K.A.'s lone touchdown.
Extra Period Battle
When the battle went into the al- j
ternate period required by the mu- '
nil rules, after a tic score at the end
of the-regular time, the El Toro team
grabbed the game on their second
play. Will Eisner on a pass from
Jim Triolo sprinted 40 yards to the
winning touchdown which added
two points to the total score to give
the clubmen a 8-6 win.
With the score-book reading 0-0 j
at the end of the regular game pe
riod of the Alpha Sig-El Campo tilt, '
the game went into the extra alter
nate period which demands that the :
ball be placed in the center of the
field and each team be given five 1
plays alternating in turn. Emmet i
Hayes of the Alpha Sigs received a j
pass from Bill Engquist and sprinted 1
half the length of the field to a |
touchdown and the two winning i
points.
21-0 Score Easy
The outcome of Phi Delt-Theta i
Delt game rested safely in the hands !
of the men from Phi Delta Theta l
during the entire contest. The first {
score for the Phi Delt team came I
on a play engineered by Bill Saufley i
and Stew Pitt. Pitt on a 25-yard I
pass from Saufley ran another 30 '
yards to a touchdown. Saufley;
place-kicked for the conversion I
point.
After a blocked kick and a pass, j
a forward lateral from Pitt to Lawry !
McGuire to Mark Godfrey good for :
13 yards accounted for the secondj
touchdown. McGuire stopped Gene |
Moffat of the Theta Delts behind
the goal to add two more points to I
the Phi Delt score. When Bill Stark j
intercepted a Theta Delt pass and I
ran to a touchdown, the Phi Delts '
ended the scoring business for the
clay. Moffat played an outstanding |
game for Theta Delta Chi.
