Two tie games and an extra pe-
riod in each battle climaxed a se-
ries of sensational plays in yester-
day's touch football games of the
first round in the intramural season.
A pass and a 40-yard run brought
El Toro a 8-6 triumph in the extra
period of the game against the grid
squad from Kappa Alpha, and a like
feat under like circumstances gave
the Alpha Sigs a 2-0 victory over
El Campo. The men from Phi Delta
Theta piled up the greatest score
made this year to win an easy 21-0
victory from the Theta Delts.
Opening the game with the K.A.'s,
El Toro drove into enemy territory
where Morris Oppenheim ran 20
yards from scrimmage for a touch-
down. Up to the last five minutes
of play the two teams see-sawed
back and forth. Topping a power-
ful aerial attack brandished during
the earlier part of the game, the
squad from Kappa Alpha pulled a
surprise in the little time that was
left. Fred Wright, passer par-excel-
lence, heaved a pass from mid-field
to Harry Stark on the Toro goal line
for the K.A.'s lone touchdown.
Extra Period Battle
When the battle went into the al-
ternate period required by the mu-
ral rules, after a tie score at the end
of the regular time, the El Toro team
grabbed the game on their second
play. Will Eisner on a pass from
Jim Triolo sprinted 40 yards to the
winning touchdown which added
two points to the total score to give
the clubmen a 8-6 win.
With the score-book reading 0-0
at the end of the regular game pe
riod of the Alpha Sig - El Campo tilt,
the game went into the extra alter
nate period which demands that the
ball be placed in the center of the

Hayes of the Alpha Sigs received a
pass from Bill Engquist and sprinted
half the length of the field to a
touchdown and the two winning
points.
21-0 Score Easy
The outcome of Phi Delt - Theta
Delt game rested safely in the hands

during the entire contest. The first
score for the Phi Delt team came
on a play engineered by Bill Saufley
and Stew Pitt. Pitt on a 25-yard
pass from Saufley ran another 30
yards to a touchdown. Saufley
place-kicked for the conversion
point.
After a blocked kick and a pass,
a forward lateral from Pitt to Lawry
McGuire to Mark Godfrey good for
13 yards accounted for the second
touchdown. McGuire stopped Gene
Moffat of the Theta Delts behind
the goal to add two more points to

Two tie games and an extra pe-
riod in each battle climaxed a se-
ries of sensational plays in yester-
day's touch football games of the
first round in the intramural season.
A pass and a 40-yard run brought
El Toro a 8-6 triumph in the extra
period of the game against the grid
squad from Kappa Alpha, and a like
feat under like circumstances gave
the Alpha Sigs a 2-0 victory over
El Campo. The men from Phi Delta
Theta piled up the greatest score
made this year to win an easy 21-0
victory from the Theta Delts.
Opening the game with the K.A.'s,
El Toro drove into enemy territory
where Morris Oppenheim ran 20
yards from scrimmage for a touch-
down. Up to the last five minutes
of play the two teams see-sawed
back and forth. Topping a power-
ful aerial attack brandished during
the earlier part of the game, the
squad from Kappa Alpha pulled a
surprise in the little time that was
left. Fred Wright, passer par-excel-
lence, heaved a pass from mid-field
to Harry Stark on the Toro goal line
for the K.A.'s lone touchdown.
Extra Period Battle
When the battle went into the al-
ternate period required by the mu-
ral rules, after a tie score at the end
of the regular time, the El Toro team
grabbed the game on their second
play. Will Eisner on a pass from
Jim Triolo sprinted 40 yards to the
winning touchdown which added
two points to the total score to give
the clubmen a 8-6 win.
