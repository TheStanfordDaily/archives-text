# RICE-TEXAS TILT HEADS SCHEDULE FOR BIG SOUTHERN PIGSKIN TEAMS
## 
### 15, v Albert Cucrard 
Most of the big Southern teams
facc lighter opposition Saturday,
after a series of crucial contests last
week end.
Although the Rice Institute-Texas
University game headlines this
week's schedule, Virginia Poly, Ten
nessee, and Florida are still unde
feated and untied, while Tulane and
Vanderbilt, in spite of their G-6 tie,
are still very much in the running.
This undefeated quintet faces much
weaker opposition than last Satur
day:
Virginia Poly vs. Kentucky.
Tennessee vs. Maryvilie.
Florida vs. N. Carolina State.
Tulane vs. Auburn.
Vanderbilt vs. Georgia.
Tennessee and Florida should
have no trouble winning. Virginia
Poly will have her fourth hard bat
tle in as many weeks against Ken
tucky, while Auburn is in a good
spot to slip one over on Tulane. Van
derbilt-Georgia should be a classic,
in spite of the latter team's close
defeats at the hands of Virginia Poly
and Tulane. Vanderbilt's greater ex
perience will probably give the
Nashville eleven victory, but Geor
gia is fighting mad by now, and
will fight to the last ditch.
Centenary, a very strong Texas
team, meets Southern Methodist,

and it looks like another hard game
I for the Mustangs. Centenary de
feated Texas 13-7 in an early sea
son game.
Georgia Tech and North Carolina
should provide one of the better
i games. It would be hard to pick a
winner here.
Texas Aggies and Baylor tangle
in the only other Southwest con:
ference game, but will of course,
have to give way in public interest
to the Rice-Texas clash. In spite of
a superior season record, the Rice
I Owls are 10-8 short enders in neu
tral Texas cities. At Austin, the
Longhorns are 2-1 favorites, while
Rice's home town. Houston, is offer
ing even money. The game is at
tracting as much interest in the
South, as Michigan-Pittsburg are in
1 the East, or Stanford-Southern Cal
ifornia in the West.
