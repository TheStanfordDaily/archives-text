# SMALLER VARSITY PROVES BOON TO STANFORD GRAYS
## 
### 
! I
Bigger and better is, briefly, the
â–  verdict in regard to this year's Gray
footbfill squad, as compared with
, j those of recent years. Because
"Pop" Warner has seen fit to carry
' a varsity group that is smaller by
_ I about a full team than ever before,
; a number of players who would or
dinarily be good enough to make
' the varsity are out drilling with the
| Grays every night.
The additional number of players
will make it possible for Coaches
Cuddeback and Nevers to put two
equally good teams on the field in
; the few games and scrimmages al-
I lowed the Grays. Not only is the
: squad as a whole more powerful
than last year's but the number of
1 individually outstanding players is
just as great as in former seasons.
Almost the entire freshman team
J of last year, a number of transfers
' with junior college experience, and
i 1 several men who have already
?! played a season with the Grays
- ! make up a squad strong enough to
; i give any varsity outfit in the coun
try a stiff battle.
) ( A game with the California Goofs
and one with another team yet to
be selected, as well as a number of
; ; scrimmages with outside squads,
i compose the Grays' 1932 schedule.
