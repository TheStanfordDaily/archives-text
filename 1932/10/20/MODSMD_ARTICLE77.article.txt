### 
By Bill Myers
Stanford's varsity polo squad went
through its first polo scrimmage
yesterday afternoon and apparently
the summer's layoff hadn't ham
pered anyone's game. The Redshirts :
arc right back in last spring's stride
which carried them to a Pacific i
Coast Intercollegiate title.
"The boys are starting in where :
they left oil last season," said Cap- I
tain Dick Gordan, polo coach, j
"They're ready to play right now,
and by winter we should have an
even better team than last year."
Spalding Returns
Captain Pete Gillham, number |
one, and Rulus Spalding, who |
played at number two 011 last year's 1
outfit, played their usual flashy
games. These two men are practi
cally assured of regular berths again !
this season.
Other players who were callec |
out for the first two teams to scrim- 1
magt were Melone, J. Myers, Lup
pen, Gillingham, Robb, and Mayer.
At present it seems to be a toss-up
as to which of these men will even
tually play on the first four along
with Spalding and Gillham.
Schedule Unfilled
Three B squad players, Hender
son, Derby, and Geiz, were called
out for the varsity scrimmage to till
the vacancies left by Kendall, Mar
ble, and Enemark, who were unable
to report because of sickness and in
juries.
The fall schedule is still unfilled,
but Captain Gordan hopes to ar
range for two games with Peninsula
teams soon.
