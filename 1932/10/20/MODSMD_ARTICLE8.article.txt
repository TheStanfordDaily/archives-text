last Tuesday night's meeting, the
' Zeta'Psi's and the Delta Chi's have
j been excused from paying the fine
! of $10, assessed for not being rep
j resented at the meeting. The card
! system for announcing meetings of
the house presidents and the clause
I providing for the fine were put in
j effect last spring.
Although a meeting of the Inter-
I fraternity Board of Control was
j planned for this week, the date has
1 been postponed until next Wednes
; day because of so many conflicts,
i Livermore announced yesterday.
Since contacts with freshmen do not
start for two weeks, there is no
hurry for the meeting.
The board must meet to pass on
the action taken by the Interfra
ternity Council Tuesday night, set-
Ming the dates for contacts by the
I houses with the freshmen and oon
j firming the one year no-rushing

Livermore points that a freshman
who goes on an illegal rushing party
is taking a long chance, since if he
j is caught, he cannot pledge any fra
! ternity for one year. The fraternity
! which sponsors the illegal party
| may not take any pledges for the
same period.
