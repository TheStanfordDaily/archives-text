| NEW YORK, Oct. 19 (/P) â€”Further
] reduction in the price of college
| football tickets in some parts of the
1 country has resulted from a con
tinued drop in attendance, amount
-1 ing so far this year to approximately
j 20 per cent, as compared with 1931
j figures covering the country's major
j intercollegiate groups.
j Although the attendance decrease
has been widespread, several col
leges in the South and Far West
; indicate an upswing, including Stan
! lord and North Carolina State.
"The decline in gate receipts for
the big game likely will lead to fur
j ther reduction of prices," William J.
i Bingham, Harvard's director of ath
] letics, told the Associated Press. "It
| is possible a solution will be found
!in establishing a wider range of
j prices for the major contests, the
j top price for which now is $4, plus
, tax, less than it was a year ago."
