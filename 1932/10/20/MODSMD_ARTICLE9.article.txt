# Rooters Urged To Come Early For Best Seats
## 
### 
Stanford rooters for the U.S.C.
game are reminded that, because of
the smaller size of the reserved sec
tion this year it will be advisable
to go to the game early to secure
the best seats.
A1 Masters, B.A.C. graduate man
; ager, stated yesterday that the Stan-
I ford section will be only 35 rows
i high and that the rooters will be
i seated at the top first as has been
: done in the past.
A good frosh game between Stan
i ford and Menlo Junior College is
I an added incentive for students to
| start filling the rooting section
j early.
