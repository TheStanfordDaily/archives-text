# REGULATIONS ASK ROOTERS' COOPERATION
## Rally Committee Wants "Smooth, Effective" Section 
### 
The smoothest, most effective,
: most co-operative rooting section
i Stanford has ever had.
That is the aim of Rally Commit
. tee Charmani Bob Churchill for to- 1
' morrow's struggle with the Trojan.
Rooters are asked to observe the ;
| following regulations:
Co-operate
I—Get there early, as soon as pos- !
sible. Those who arrive late will be I
placed in poorer seats. I
2—Co-operate to the fullest extent J
with the yell-leaders. They will not i
be excessive in their demands on'
the rooters. Stanford must show op- j
ponents that she has spirit.
3—All men rooters must wear of
-1 fieial rooters' hats, which may be j
! purchased at Ross Bros, for $1. Men I
without these will be barred from |
I the section.
Women in White
4—All women are requested to |
j dress in white. Red and white deco- I
' rated chrysanthemums may be worn j
1 if desired.
s—Everyone is asked to learn the i
i major Stanford songs and yells so j
j that they prove effective at the (
game. Especially, know the "Tro-.
i jan Horse" words and tune.
! 6 —Follow instructions is the key
i note to the card stunts. These are j
simple and will go over big if each j
j rooter does as he is asked on the j
instruction-sheet at his seat.
Have Good Time
I 7—Have a good time —but don't do j
it at the expense of somebody else.
| Keep away from cat-calls and boo- j
ing but get behind that Indian j
i eleven and let each individual do i
j his share in defeating Southern Cal. i
The Rally Committee has worked ]
all week to complete the stunts for i
the game tomorrow, and cards will I
be fastened to the seats by 10 o'clock '
in the morning.
Rooters will be seated as they en
j ter the section, filling from the cen
ter to the top and then from the !
center down to the bottom. Because j
there are only 35 rows to the sec- I
tion, it is advisable to be there as
early as possible in order not to sit
too low in the stands.
Frosli Play Prelim
The Stanford frosh-Menlo Junior
College game will keep things inter
esting for those who arrive early to
1 help fill the section.
Final size of ,the U.S.C. rooting
I section is unknown here yet. A gi
-1 gantic rally was staged in Los An- i
j geles last night when the Trojan j
gridders entrained for Palo Alto.
