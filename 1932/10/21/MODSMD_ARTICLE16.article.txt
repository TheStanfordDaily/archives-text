# CARD SAVANT TAKES STAND FOR SLAYER
## Stanford Medic Professor Testifies Templeton Was Insane 
### 
SAN JOSE, Oct. 20 (/P)â€”Called to
the witness stand by the defense to
day to prove that Douglas Temple
ton, Jr., knife slayer of Mrs. Lillian
Babcock, was not in full possession
of his mental faculties at the time
of the killing, Dr. Julian Wolfsohn,
Stanford clinical professor of medi
cine, testified that the convicted
youth was "evidently" mentally un
balanced.
Dr. Wolfsohn, one of Stanford's
outstanding neurological experts,
made his testimony under protest.
Originally obtained by the prosecu
tion to fight the exact contention
that he proved today, Dr. Wolfsohn
said that he had based his conclu
sion on an examination of the young
killer. Under cross examination, the
alienist added that if the statements
made by Templeton could be proven
false, it would follow that the in
sanity deduction might also be
faulty.
Another Alienist Called
The defense employed another
alienist in addition to Dr. Wolfsohn.
Dr. Joseph Catton added to the
trial's mounting sensationalism by
stating that Templeton is planning
to return and "get" his uncle, Wil
liam Rider Babcock, whenever he is
freed from custody.
Adding to Dr. Wolfsohn's testi
mony that Templeton was mentally
unbalanced, Dr. Catton told the
court the result of his examination
of the Los Altos slayer. "Temple
ton," said the alienist, "is absolutely
devoid of remorse. He believes he
had a job to do and accomplished
part of it in killing his aunt, but
that he failed in the rest of it in
that he didn't kill his uncle. When
he is released he plans to go back
and finish the job."
Sheriff Backs Sanity
The prosecution then called Sher
iff William J. Emig and Jailer How
ard Buffington as its first witnesses
against the insanity defense. Both
testified that Templeton apepared
sane at the time of his arrest.
Dr. E. D. Bocks of San Jose State
Teachers' College than proved that
kerosene was less dangerous to
handle than gasoline. This was ap
parently offered on the theory of
the state that it indcaited Temple
ton's methods of preparing for the
knife attack were such as a sane
person would adopt.
Kerosene, seemingly taken to the
scene of the fatal stabbing by Tem
pleton, was found by officers at the
house where the killing occurred. It
appeared that Templeton had plan
ned to set fire to the house after the
killing.
