# STANFORD STILL 10-7 FAVORITE TO DEFEAT U.S.C.
## Warner Offense One Of Best In Cards' History Indians Display Good Team Morale as Preparations for Important Coast Conference Skirmish Here Tomorrow Draw to Close THUNDERING HERD ARRIVES THIS MORNING Southern California Eleven to Average 201 Pounds Per Man Against Stanford's 187 
### BOB WADE 
Forty-four grim, determined, confident Stanford Indians today stood
ready to repel the onslaught of thirty-eight invading University of South
ern California Trojans when they hattle in Stanford Stadium tomorrow

\ afternoon, starting with the opening kickoiY at 2
? o'clock. The visitors arrive at the Castlcwood
Country Club this morning, and they will he there
until shortly before game time. Contrary to his
usual policy, Warner will not take his charges into
seclusion.
The odds favor Stanford, 10 to 7. and general
* opinion is to the effect that the Cards are due ti>
I end the long famine that has pursued them since
I that shaky 13-12 victory in 192 G.
* Word from the Trojan camp states that all the
j: cripples are back in harness, and Jones will be
| abbe to throw his full strength against the fast
| improving Indians. In the light of previous ex
perience this should not fool Warner at all, however,
since Mohler was supposed to be sick for the week
| preceding last year's slaughter also. The Trojans
always have their full roster to battle the Cards no
matter how many dead and dying there may have
i. been before the game. Warner has drilled more
than for a Big Game or any previous set-to with

the invaders. He stressed fundamentals in the early
j season, until all of his boys learned how to stop all five of the Trojans
who have the ball at the same time. He grounded them in the correct

• manner of disposing of annoying
passes that might come Stanford's
1 way.
: And finally, with all of this be
! hind his hopefuls, he picked out a
j baekfield, or two, or three, and told
j them that they were to play together
j until they could keep time with his
j counting system.

And out of
» all this care
ful planning
he evolved a
machine, the
like of which
has not been
seen on the
campus for
many years.
And into this
machine he
has poured a
spirit that so
far has n't
even been
dimmed,
I mu c h less
tamed.

ers, a quarterback who may out
general the great Orv Mohler, and
will, if the Stanford lines lives up to
expectations, and an offense which
probably will elaborate on the at
tack that has been used so far this
year.

Troy Best Off Tackle, Passing
Southern California is depending
lon its off-tackle thrusts, and new
forward passing barrage to bring
j victory over the favored Stanford
j forces. But Warner has been plan
j ning for this game for weeks, and
' there isn't a chance that the boys
will be caught napping. Pop, the
team, and Stanford want to win this
game more than they have wanted
1 to win any game in years.' The old
S.C. JINX IS GOING OVER
BOARD, and Stanford is set to win

| its biggest game of the year BY A
j CONVINCING SCORE.
Stanford has everything this year
' that it has wanted, and that past
teams have usually possessed in
part. It has good passers in Walker,
Allen, Campbell, good kickers in
i Anderson, Afflerbaugh, Caddel, and
I Sim, and good runners galore.
Indians Have Precision
There is more precision than ever
;to the Warner system, due partly
: to the shift and partly to the better
' drilling early in the season.
I But above all, Stanford has a line.
Stanford has line replacements that
! are as good as the starters, and line
! play that far outshines anything
[ that Coach Howard Jones has had
; to face so far. Stanford hasn't been
j stopped yet, and tomorrow will be
1 no exception.
Forty-four grim, determined, confident Stanford Indians today stood
ready to repel the onslaught of thirty-eight invading University of South
ern California Trojans when they hattle in Stanford Stadium tomorrow

\ afternoon, starting with the opening kickoiY at 2
? o'clock. The visitors arrive at the Castlcwood
Country Club this morning, and they will he there
until shortly before game time. Contrary to his
usual policy, Warner will not take his charges into
seclusion.
The odds favor Stanford, 10 to 7. and general
* opinion is to the effect that the Cards are due ti>
I end the long famine that has pursued them since
I that shaky 13-12 victory in 192 G.
* Word from the Trojan camp states that all the
j: cripples are back in harness, and Jones will be
| abbe to throw his full strength against the fast
| improving Indians. In the light of previous ex
perience this should not fool Warner at all, however,
since Mohler was supposed to be sick for the week
| preceding last year's slaughter also. The Trojans
always have their full roster to battle the Cards no
matter how many dead and dying there may have
i. been before the game. Warner has drilled more
than for a Big Game or any previous set-to with

the invaders. He stressed fundamentals in the early
j season, until all of his boys learned how to stop all five of the Trojans
who have the ball at the same time. He grounded them in the correct

• manner of disposing of annoying
passes that might come Stanford's
1 way.
: And finally, with all of this be
! hind his hopefuls, he picked out a
j baekfield, or two, or three, and told
j them that they were to play together
j until they could keep time with his
j counting system.

And out of
» all this care
ful planning
he evolved a
machine, the
like of which
has not been
seen on the
campus for
many years.
And into this
machine he
has poured a
spirit that so
far has n't
even been
dimmed,
I mu c h less
tamed.
Stanford
fans will see,
when the Big
Red Machine
rolls out on

j the Stadium turf, a shift that can

i and higher than any of S.C.'s hoot
ers, a quarterback who may out
general the great Orv Mohler, and
will, if the Stanford lines lives up to
expectations, and an offense which
probably will elaborate on the at
tack that has been used so far this
year.
Warner gave an idea of what he:

and if he doesn't show something
