# CONFIDENCE!
## 
### 
Call it jus I a football game, this meeting of Stanford)
and Troy. Call il just another big gridiron show, with all
the trappings. Call il the traditional Stanford-Troy battle,!
a sports classic remarkable for its demonstration of sterling]
football, always a light to be won or lost with laughs orj
tears. Call it all that, if.von will, and you still haven't hit
upon the true significance of what is going to happen out I
there on the Stadium turf tomorrow afternoon.
Confidence, the team has, confidence on the eve of a
football clash with the mighty Trojan! And already that
confidence has spread to a college generation of fans who;
had contracted, through five lean autumns of football re-j
lations with 1.5.C., an inferiority complex which under
mined the morale of fan and athlete alike. Hut still, on
the Farm, there arc those who believe it just can't happen. l
Tliev have never seen it happen, even in 1929, when pre-i
game dope indicated that an Indian victory was virtually!
in the bag.
Let il saturate the Cardinal stands Saturday, this newj
feeling of the team that Troy can and will be defeated, j
Let il surge and flow in quantities of fight and spirit that i
can't be denied a triumph, a triumph that will drown for
ever (hat insidious, morale-wrecking "fear I'.S.C." attitude.'
