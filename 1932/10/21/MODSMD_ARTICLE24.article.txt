### 
Those gentlemen who might he templed to dispose of
their poolers' tickets for the forthcoming friendly contest
with the Los Angeles Trojans are ottered the fatherly ad
vice to resist this desire.
The philosopher has said, "(laze knowingly before you
leap or you may get into a helluva mess." The B.A.C.
hacked hy the Men's Council will penalize anyone who has
allowed his rooter's ticket to he used hy any person other
than himself. This year, as last, the full punishment—the
forfeiture of all ticket privileges forever—wil he enforced.
Careful check will he made hy the ushers and the mem
bers of the Rally Committee on all those entering the root
ing section. All questionable persons will he required to
produce their student body cards for identification. The
risk involved for the violaters of this privilege is indeed
great and seems hardly worth the very small "cake" for
which they are gambling.
