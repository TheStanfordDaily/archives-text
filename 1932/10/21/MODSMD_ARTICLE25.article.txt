And now, at a time like this, when all waking thoughts
drift toward the Trojan game and tomorrow night's fes
tivities, the rough can't help hoping that he won't have to
get up early Sunday morning to bail his pals out of the
Palo Alto jail. The iron hand of John Law, Bryant street,
Palo Alto, does not, of course, touch the sheltered lives of
Stanford students, but on occasions like tomorrow it some
times causes them a great deal of embarrassment.
Each year visiting Bears and Trojans, not so wary as
the Indians, who know the peculiarities of the local police
department, are in constant danger of receiving very urgent
invitations to accept the hospitality of the city. For ex
ample, at the time of the final Olympic tryouts here this
summer, three sports writers from Los Angeles were
picked up for drunkenness at an all-night restaurant on
the Circle, where they were bothering no one. Before ac
costing these men in the restaurant, the P.A.P.I). "night
riders" look it unto themselves to search their car, in which
was discovered a hit of damaging evidence. The L.A.
scribes, line fellows all, spent the night in jail.
Although their efficiency may seem, at times, to bear
down a trifle harshly 011 campus men, Palo Alto's police
are remarkably successful at maintaining peace and order
in their community. But why, in the name of justice, must
they make it hot for visiting collegians, on those rare occa
sions when Stanford is the hub of undergraduate and hil
arity?
The Palo Alto police department would certainly make
no enemies were it to follow the excellent example of San
Francisco's blue-coats and gaze upon tin 4 evening's cele
bration with a slightly more philosophic attitude.

In seven lines the best tiling you can do is to take a good
dig at somebody who deserves it, and if anything ever
needed improvement it is the brand of yell leading we
have been getting around here in the last two weeks. Oh,
for a "Personality" Speegle or a "Red Socks" Daves to
grace the present "mourners' bench" at the foot of the Stan
ford rooting section!

Although their efficiency may seem, at times, to bear
down a trifle harshly 011 campus men, Palo Alto's police
are remarkably successful at maintaining peace and order
in their community. But why, in the name of justice, must
they make it hot for visiting collegians, on those rare occa
sions when Stanford is the hub of undergraduate and hil
arity?
The Palo Alto police department would certainly make
no enemies were it to follow the excellent example of San
Francisco's blue-coats and gaze upon tin 4 evening's cele
bration with a slightly more philosophic attitude.

In seven lines the best tiling you can do is to take a good
dig at somebody who deserves it, and if anything ever
needed improvement it is the brand of yell leading we
have been getting around here in the last two weeks. Oh,
for a "Personality" Speegle or a "Red Socks" Daves to
grace the present "mourners' bench" at the foot of the Stan
ford rooting section!
