# BULL SESSION
## WHAT A GAME! 
### 
Everyone on the Daily knows that
I there is only one subject that in
' terests anyone on the campus today
I —and that is football. More specifi
; cally, the much-heralded Classic of
■ the West—Terrible Trojans vs. the
j Übiquitous Indians—a battle to the
goal line in four quarters and 22
dirty jerseys.
Those unfortunate would-be ty
coons of the typewriters who have
j to write on shows, news, politics—
I anything but football, drool pitifully
; over their copy, knowing full well
1 that it will probably never see print
j and if it ever manages to make a
j back page, no one will read it. On
. the other hand, those gallant
j gauchos of the ink-pot who turn out
i gridiron goulash beam with inflated
j ego-maximation knowing full well
that every word will be read, de-
I voured, re-read, and re-devoured
by a rabid campus public.
The Presidential race, the new
! dramatic presentation, the new se
! lection in the library, the latest ex
! periment in the lab—all such stuff
! is forgotten as the day for the
crunching of bones and crunching of
rooters' hearts in wild excitement
draws near. The philosophy of Plato
is charming—but who could com
i pare it to the roar of the 80.000?
I (For the sake of our mortgages we
hope the B.A.C. sells all the tickets.)
1 And it is only natural that the
: running, blocking, and smashing is
; infinitely more interesting than any

thing mere education can hope to
1 offer. It's no use. Football IS king;
and at its throne must beg educa
i tion and culture for humble right
! to draw breath and meekly wend
their way among the Library's dusty
J stacks.
Football is natural —it's youthful
i —it beats with the throb of life!
While education is unnatural and
i interest in it can only be self-in
| jected with great personal struggle.
And watching a game, has thrill
! galore; and no expending of effort,
i no knawing of tedious hours—as en-
I joyable and simple as eating crisp
; capon wings in the privacy of one's
j own dining-room.
j That's where the danger of foot-
I ball lies. It doesn't have to pervert
• educational ideals—it just stops
i them from ever seeing light of day.
;To get a cultural outlook is the
i high and narrow path; while at
' every step there stands the fresh
I figure of smiling football to lure
! the weak or wavering down into |
| the pleasant swimming pools of j
j bleacher-excitement.
Yes, it will be a great game. And
| when Stanford puts over the first j
j touchdown—we expect to yell. Just
I yesterday we had the doctor re-
I fasten our tonsils to be sure they
j wouldn't come loose and get in the
way. What a game! And then topped
off by the All-University Hop at
8:30 o'clock! Going to college surely
lis sa-well. —Abe Mellinkoff
