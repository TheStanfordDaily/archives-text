LIGHT IN AUGUST. By William
Faulkner. Smith and Haas. (At
the Stanford Bookstore).
The character of a mulatto, Christ
; mas, furnishes Faulkner an oppor
-1 tunity to distend his effective style
[ with the usual terrors of rape and
j murder. How near to normality lit
| erature must approach in order to
j survive is not easily determined. Cer
i tainly the personality of Christmas
is more real than that of Popeye in
Sanctuary.
Perhaps this is because Christmas'
early life is more clearly presented
| than the youth of Popeye, and the
j knowledge of causes makes the re
j suit seem more natural. 'A.picture of
j the gutter, however, no matter how
j skilfully drawn, is only a transient
I curiosity. Ugliness may be valuable
! to heighten, by antithesis, the more
j fortunate aspects of normality. But
once this is accomplished, the per
' verted fades.
Faulkner, with remarkable word
effects, is as clever with prose as any
j of his contemporaries. He is capable
j of producing something worthwhile;
! but he never will.
He has a mind which is profoundly
sensitive; a mind which, had it not
been deflected downward, might
have found success in a field more
valuable than the perverted. But he
has become so satiated with the crass
that delicacy fails to entice him.
j Only seldom while exploring the
| sewer does he find reflected star
i light.
j Faulkner is involved with the ele
| ments of mental torture. His inter
■ est in sensation drives him to ex-
I press in his writings, exagerrated and
I painful experiences. This technic—
1 arousing horror in an audience—has
been miscalled artistic sadism. It is
j not sadism but masochism. Faulkner
! tortures himself more than he dis
i turbs others. D.E.S.

J "THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT"
| (Paramount) at the Varsity Thea-

I tcr<
Cavorting about at the expense of
1 our impeccable government has be
come the theater's chief diversions

I of late, as witness "Of Thee I Sing,"
! and the present opus, "The Phantom
President."
! Although less subtle than its
! predecessor, George M. Cohan's first
film is nonetheless a very cleverly
! conceived affair. The famous actor
composer who entertained Broadway
I for a generation has finally gotten
| around to the movies, and there is
no sign in the film of the friction
which marked its preparation.
1 It is a rollicking, raucous affair--
the story of a dull but capable can
didate who finds an exact double in
! the person of a gay medicine man
whom he hires to be his "person
| ality" during the campaign. There
■ are the usual scenes with the hero
j ine, who finds Blair a "changed man"
\ and decides she loves him after all.
This part makes no particular de
mands on Claudette Colbei't, and she
handles it ably.
Jimmie Durante, in the face of
competition with two Cohans on the
j screen, scores a decided hit in his
j best role so far. His boisterous com
i edy, his insane lines (and his "Am I
mortified?") give the film a pleasing
j stacatto tempo.
Cohan's personality makes an
agreeable impression; both he and
the redoubtable Mr. Durante have
specialty numbers, and Cohan more
than maintains his end of it. Clever
though he is, Hollywood should
j worry if Cohan thumbed his nose at
! it. Now if Jimmie Durante had
1 thumbed his nose .... E.C.
