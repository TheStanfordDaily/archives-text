The Editor, Sir:
That old fighting spirit was in
evidence at the rally, but a lot of
it was fighting for cigarettes, not
for Stanford. As members of the
freshman class, several of rny class
mates and I would like to know
whether it is customary or neces
sary to promise cigarettes in order
to make a rally successful.
If such is the case, why not carry
the idea to its logical conclusion,
furnish ice cream cones to all those
who show up at the field.
The rally increased our pride in
being Stanford men, yet this thought
occurred to us. After several years
of campus life will our enthusiasm,
also, need the added stimular of
cigarettes? Richard Collins, '36
