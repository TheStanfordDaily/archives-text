The market weakened today, al
though railroad stocks held well.
The tobacco issues again slid off.
Rumor has it that competition from
recently intraductal ten-cent cigar
ettes has begun to affect the sales
of the popular fifteen-cent brands.
The bond market was steady, es
pecially first class descriptions.
Cheap money in New York has sent
most first grade issues yielding over
4 1 ■> % ever par.
The trend in earning reports is
"slowly changing. By comparison
with 1931 earnings, the figures for
the current year are on the whole
fair, and in some respects materially
better than in the preceding year.
Cofnpanies finding difficulties in
business at the present time in
clude tractions and chains. The
traction group in New York. San
Francisco, and Los Angeles are all
faced with decreased gross income
and fare increase impossibilities.
Chain stores are up against the
problem of high rents on leases con
tracted in boom years. The recent
receivership of a prominent San
Francisco drug chain is traced di
rectly to enormous renting rates.
Theatre holding companies are like
wise concerned with costs of opera
ton. It is reported that San Fran
cisco's largest house will shut its
doors next week, due to inability to
meet running expenses; the same
situation exists in Oakland where
that, city's most magnificent house
is dark.
While the moving picture produc
ing companies have cut production
expenses severely they still are run
ning a poor race due to continued
drops in box-office receipts. Uni
versal and Columbia are in the best
position here for, unlike Radio,
Paramount. Fox, and United Artists,
they are not connected with any
theatre chains.

The small volume which has

characterized the last few sessions
attests to the fact that the public is
still shy of the stock market; no
doubt awaiting election results.
