SOMETHING to battle about before
the big battle got under way! After

US.C. game without a good fight in
the papers to go along with it?

known fact that Troy's running
guard has a habit of playing in the
backfield v/hen he is better placed
on the line.

Howard Jones came to the coast
Pop isn't leaving a single visabh
loophole for that elusive phantom—
a victory over Troy. And Jones i:
so worried about his offense he has
even instituted a passing attack.
It's a far cry when the quiet
Brother Jones can't have his
teams walk through and over
the opposition. But gone is his
greatest player, Ernie Piiukert,
and although they may he good,
Gordon ( lark and Cal Clemens j
are a long way from the sure
lire blocker of last year.
Jones has a team that weighs ;
20/ pounds a man, if he starts
Jorgenson at center, and yet
with all this advantage (Stan
ford will average around 187)
the Trojans will have to show
much more than they have this
year to keep the Indians out of
their hackficld.
WE DON'T USUALLY GO IN
FOR predictions, but here are a few
that we will take a chance on re
gretting: U.S.C. will block no Stan- i
lord kicks, they will not score on j
end runs, if they do score it will be |
on an off-tackle thrust or a pass,!
Colvin will snag lit least one "croo
cial" pass, Afflerbaugh will make
them dizzy if he gets a crack at the
safety job, Hillman and Baker will j
make them think that they are try
ing to stop Musick and Shaver, and
Caddel will make them forget or re
member, as you wish, what Bucky j
O'Connor did to them a few years j
ago in the Coliseum.
THE U.S.C. PUBLICITY MAN
HAS BEEN up here moaning
low over the Troy forces. He
thinks that they will he beaten,
that they will fail to overpower
l lie Stanford line, that they will
fail (o do this and to do that,
but then, he is paid to say
SOMETHING. Wouldn't it he
fancy if lie were right??????
Stanford's backfield will he
the most potent factor in turn
ing the tide, not because they
are the greatest in the country,
but because they have played
together, because the Trojan
backs sat on (he bench last year,
and because Stanford has a
"poosh" this year that it hasn't
had before.
TO SAY THAT the Trojan line is I
likely to be the one chant j of vie- I
lory for the Southerners is probably |
not stretching the point too far, now j
that, the final practices have come i
to a close and there is noihing to
do but wait.
However, those who seem to feel ;
that Stanford's line is going to have 1
more than it can handle, had better |
take stock of their finances again be
fore putting all their money one way i
or the other.
At center, for example the Red- i
shirts have come up so surprisingly j
in the last few weeks that now they
may safely be rated on a par, per- ;
haps better than the Trojans. Acting
Captain Bill Bates has turned into
a fighting fool who rates second to |
no one on the coast. True, U.S.C.'s j
Youel and Jorgenson are just about I
on a par, but they lack experience, j
and neither of them have been play- I
ing very steadily this year. One is a
demon on offense and the other on i
defense. Bates is a whale of center |
on both the attack, and on stopping I
plays. He blocked the kick that |
broke Santa Clara, and he stopped
everything that they sent his way. j

the most potent factor in turn

are the greatest in the country,
but because they have played
together, because the Trojan
backs sat on (he bench last year,
and because Stanford has a
"poosh" this year that it hasn't
had before.
TO SAY THAT the Trojan line is I

to a close and there is noihing to

that Stanford's line is going to have 1

At center, for example the Red- i

in the last few weeks that now they

Brother Jones can't have his

SO THEY HAD TO HAVE
SOMETHING to battle about before
the big battle got under way! After
all, what is the annual Stanford-
US.C. game without a good fight in
the papers to go along with it?
Jones figures that he can bawl up
the works by catching the Indians
jumping the gun once or twice. And
Pop comes right back with the well
known fact that Troy's running
guard has a habit of playing in the
backfield v/hen he is better placed
on the line.
But they aren't very'serious about
their press remarks, these two A-l
coaches, they are all wrapped up ir
what promises to be the best exhi
bition their teams have put on sinc<
Howard Jones came to the coast
Pop isn't leaving a single visabh
loophole for that elusive phantom—
a victory over Troy. And Jones i:
so worried about his offense he has
even instituted a passing attack.
It's a far cry when the quiet
Brother Jones can't have his
teams walk through and over
the opposition. But gone is his
greatest player, Ernie Piiukert,
and although they may he good,
Gordon ( lark and Cal Clemens j
are a long way from the sure
lire blocker of last year.
Jones has a team that weighs ;
20/ pounds a man, if he starts
Jorgenson at center, and yet
with all this advantage (Stan
ford will average around 187)
the Trojans will have to show
much more than they have this
year to keep the Indians out of
their hackficld.
WE DON'T USUALLY GO IN
FOR predictions, but here are a few
that we will take a chance on re
gretting: U.S.C. will block no Stan- i
lord kicks, they will not score on j
end runs, if they do score it will be |
on an off-tackle thrust or a pass,!
Colvin will snag lit least one "croo
cial" pass, Afflerbaugh will make
them dizzy if he gets a crack at the
safety job, Hillman and Baker will j
make them think that they are try
ing to stop Musick and Shaver, and
Caddel will make them forget or re
member, as you wish, what Bucky j
O'Connor did to them a few years j
ago in the Coliseum.
THE U.S.C. PUBLICITY MAN
HAS BEEN up here moaning
low over the Troy forces. He
thinks that they will he beaten,
that they will fail to overpower
l lie Stanford line, that they will
fail (o do this and to do that,
but then, he is paid to say
SOMETHING. Wouldn't it he
fancy if lie were right??????
Stanford's backfield will he
the most potent factor in turn
ing the tide, not because they
are the greatest in the country,
but because they have played
together, because the Trojan
backs sat on (he bench last year,
and because Stanford has a
"poosh" this year that it hasn't
had before.
TO SAY THAT the Trojan line is I
likely to be the one chant j of vie- I
lory for the Southerners is probably |
not stretching the point too far, now j
that, the final practices have come i
to a close and there is noihing to
do but wait.
However, those who seem to feel ;
that Stanford's line is going to have 1
more than it can handle, had better |
take stock of their finances again be
fore putting all their money one way i
or the other.
At center, for example the Red- i
shirts have come up so surprisingly j
in the last few weeks that now they
may safely be rated on a par, per- ;
haps better than the Trojans. Acting
Captain Bill Bates has turned into
a fighting fool who rates second to |
no one on the coast. True, U.S.C.'s j
Youel and Jorgenson are just about I
on a par, but they lack experience, j
and neither of them have been play- I
ing very steadily this year. One is a
demon on offense and the other on i
