# Freshman Team to Oppose Menlo J. C. Eleven
## YEARLINGS AFTER WIN WITHOUT USE OF ALL REGULARS Reisner, Bronstein, Sears, 'And Lewis Starting Against Oaks 
### Dick Strouse 
"Maybe thinks we'll win,
and then again maybe he thinks
he'll win." Thus did Coach Chuck
Winterburn of the Stanford fresh
man football team respond to the
statement of Mentor Sweet of the
Menlo Junior College's eleven that
will furnish tin frosh their opposi
tion at. 11:30 o'clock Saturday morn
ing. Sweet has gone on record as
insisting that the frosh have a better
team than he can put on the field.
Winterburn, who believes until he
is shown differently, will start a
strong team but not his strongest
on the assumption that Sweet means
what he says. Chuck would like
nothing better than to get through
Saturday's game without chancing
injuries to his strongest lineup. But
Chuck would like nothing less than
a loss to Menlo.
Teams on Par
The team that Winterburn plans
on starting should, claims the head
man of the yearlings, be about on
a par with Sweet's sweet aggrega
tion. Chuck will play that team un
less it is scored on; if the latter
happens he will be able to insert a
stronger outfit.
And if Menlo is worse Lhan ex
pected, Winterburn can work down
wards instead of upwards, so com
plete is his squad with both excel
lent and just fair players. "We
won't chance a loss," says Chuck,
"but we won't run up a score."
Kingsbury and Leedy, the reglu
lar ends, will open as Sweet plans
on concentrating on an open game.
Carlson and Maentz will play
tackles, and this pair is practically
on a par with Reynolds and Calla
way, the usual starters.
Evarls to Start
Because of his good work last
week against San Jose State's year
lings, Evarts will be given one of
the starting guard berths. Bardin
will open opposite Evarts, due to an
injury to Pinnotti.
Howell, a former Menlo player
himself, will be given a chance to
show his former teammates how a
Stanford freshman plays center.
Lewis, who has been more or less
of a regular more or less of the
time, has drawn the starting quar
terback post.
Johnny Reisner —the fastest sub
stitute on a freshman team in the
country—will play left, half, and
Bronstein will play the other wing
back. The other star of last Satur
day's San Jose game, Dave Sears,
will play fullback.
