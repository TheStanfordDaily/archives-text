CHICAGO, Oct. 20 (/P)-Eric Ru
dolph Diez, why plotted to extort
money by mail from the fathers of
society brides by threatening their
daughters, was sentenced to 20 years
in Leavenworth penitentiary and
fined $4,000 today.
Federal Judge Charles E. Wood
ward imposed sentence upon the
first man convicted here under the
new Federal kidnaping law enacted
after the abduction of the Lindbergh
baby.
"I believe this is just the sort of
thing Congress tried to prevent,"
said Judge Woodward. "The sen
tence may seem severe, but because
of the statute itself which provides
20 years I must impose it."
