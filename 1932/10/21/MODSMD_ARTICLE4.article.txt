# TWO DEADLY INDIAN ARROWS
## 
### 

On the right we
have BILL SIM,
Stanford's n e w
halfback terror,
going places in a
big hurry. While
on the left is glue
fingered DON
COLVIN, one of
the best ends the
Indians have ever
turned out. COL
VIN is counted on
for at least one
"impossible" catch
every game, and
he is such a con
stant threat that
Pop uses him to
draw out two or
three of the de
fensive backs on
one play. (Cour
tesy San Fran
cisco Examiner.)
