# Trojans Flash, Fall In Battles Thus Far

A 200-pound backfield powered by |
Gus Shaver, Erny Pinckert, and Jim
Musick carried Southern California
to victory over California, Stanford.
Tulane, and Notre Dame in the Tro- i
jans' four most, important games last
year.
But Troy's three bruising backs
ended their three-year terms last
fall, so Howard Jones has had to j
mold a new backfield out of a flock
of fast, but light, sophomores, a few
of last year's reserves, and a smaller
junior college crop lhan in former
seasons.
Jones realized, however, that he \
still had the strongest line on the
Pacific Coast, perhaps the best in 1
the country. His only worry was j
backfield material. Southern Cali
fornia feared University of Utah this
fall as she had never feared an
opening day opponent before, St.
Mary's excepted. The Trojans won
impressively, 35-0.
Washington State came next, and i
lost 20-0. The Trojans had to take
to the air to score, although Tay
Brown blocked one kick for a touch
down. Jones went on the coaching j
rack . . . the Trojans had not im- I
proved a mite since the previous i
Saturday, sports writers said.
Oregon State came down from the |
north with a 27-0 licking at Stan- '
ford's hands, fought the Trojans up
and down the field, and lost by the |
margin of a fluke touchdown and a
field goal. Jones was getting worse, i
said observers.
Southern California scheduled a >
breather with Loyola for the week- !
end preceding the Stanford massa- j
ere. Here was one game the Head ;

Man would take without much
trouble. But Tom Lieb, the Loyola
coach, expected to hold the Trojans
to three touchdowns. Lieb lost by
only one, when a referee with a
pricking conscience gave the Tro
jans a first down on Loyola's three
yard line by virtue of a forward
pass interfering penalty.
Impartial critics are still wonder
ing whether Troy is really so much
weaker than last year, or whether
she has been holding back. "Weak"
Trojan teams in past years have
come back on the day of the Stan
ford game to march all over their
opponents.

Trojan teams in past years have
come back on the day of the Stan
ford game to march all over their
opponents.
A 200-pound backfield powered by |
Gus Shaver, Erny Pinckert, and Jim
Musick carried Southern California
to victory over California, Stanford.
Tulane, and Notre Dame in the Tro- i
jans' four most, important games last
year.
But Troy's three bruising backs
ended their three-year terms last
fall, so Howard Jones has had to j
mold a new backfield out of a flock
of fast, but light, sophomores, a few
of last year's reserves, and a smaller
junior college crop lhan in former
seasons.
Jones realized, however, that he \
still had the strongest line on the
Pacific Coast, perhaps the best in 1
the country. His only worry was j
backfield material. Southern Cali
fornia feared University of Utah this
fall as she had never feared an
opening day opponent before, St.
Mary's excepted. The Trojans won
impressively, 35-0.
Washington State came next, and i
lost 20-0. The Trojans had to take
to the air to score, although Tay
Brown blocked one kick for a touch
down. Jones went on the coaching j
rack . . . the Trojans had not im- I
proved a mite since the previous i
Saturday, sports writers said.
Oregon State came down from the |
north with a 27-0 licking at Stan- '
ford's hands, fought the Trojans up
and down the field, and lost by the |
margin of a fluke touchdown and a
field goal. Jones was getting worse, i
said observers.
Southern California scheduled a >
breather with Loyola for the week- !
end preceding the Stanford massa- j
ere. Here was one game the Head ;

Man would take without much
trouble. But Tom Lieb, the Loyola
coach, expected to hold the Trojans
to three touchdowns. Lieb lost by
only one, when a referee with a
pricking conscience gave the Tro
jans a first down on Loyola's three
yard line by virtue of a forward
pass interfering penalty.
Impartial critics are still wonder
ing whether Troy is really so much
weaker than last year, or whether
she has been holding back. "Weak"
