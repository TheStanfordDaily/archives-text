# Weakened Cardinal Soccer Team Faces S. F. U. Squad
## CARDS NEED MODE OFFENSIVE POWER TO CONQUER DONS Coach Maloney Organizes New Forward Line For Tilt 
### Maurice Rapf 
It will be a weak, crippled, and
somewhat disorganized Stanford In
dian which faces the strong San
Francisco University soccer team to
morrow morning on the local field
in a game which may find the local
eleven on the short end of the score
for the first time since the begin
ning of last season.
There can be no doubt about the
fact that there is a potentially good
team on the soccer fieid. In fact,
the team that opens the game to
morrow will be POTENTIALLY
powerful. But potential strength
docs not score goals, and until Coach
Harry Maloney's team wakes up to
this fact, it won't play real soccer.
It is true that the team won its
first two games this year, but a 2-1
victory over San Jose and a 2-2 tie
with San Mateo, gives no indica
tion of another championship team.
The team that battled for forty-five
minutes with an inexperienced frosh
eleven yesterday afternoon, and
failed to score, is in no position
to successfully defend a title against
an S.F.U. squad which has an im
pressive 11-1 win over San Jose and
an easy 3-0 victory over San Mateo
to its credit.
Dons Not "Cinches"
Tomorrow's game is not on ice for
the city team. Eleven Stanford men,
fighting, scrapping, and playing co
operative ball as a single unit,
COULD beat the Dons, and if the
men carry out what Coach Maloney
outlines at this afternoon's chalk
talk, they may be able to do it.
After a week of experimentation,
which saw the line-up being con
stantly shifted about, a satisfactory
eleven has been organized.
Either Jack King or Milt Newman,
probably both, will guard the goal
against the scoring strength of the
invaders. On these men and the
fullbacks, Brekelbaum and Krum
bein, lie a great deal of the respon
sibility.
The scoring duties, necessarily car
ried out if the team is to win, fall
on the newly organized forward line
with Knecht at outside left, Sutow
at inside left, Hearn, center forward,
Johnson, inside right, and Doditig
ton, outside right. Halves in to
morrow's game will be Spohr, right,
Washburn, center, and Kennedy,
left.
