# Greys Use Trojan Plays In Workout With Varsity
## 
### 
With Murray Cuddeback sending
| one team through its paces in a
, workout with the varsity and Ernie
I Nevers giving two others a stiff
! scrimmage session on their own
| tield, the various units of the Stan
| ford Greys were kept on the jump
; yesterday afternoon.
Cuddeback's team has been
j spending most of its time during the
j last two weeks perfecting a series
j of U.S.C. formations to use against
: the varsity in preparing for the an
j nual Trojan encounter. According
j to previous plans these plays were
j to be used only in dummy scrim
; mage but what "Pop" Warner has
j actually chosen to do with them
I remains locked withm the gates of
the varsity practice field.
