# MENLO'S COACH DOUBTS GRANGES TO BEAT FROSH
## Sweet Plans To Save Men For Marin Contest Next Weekend 
### Dick Strouse 
Planning to concentrate on stop
ping Stanford and scoring himself
through the air, Coach Russ Sweet
of Menlo Junior College admitted
yesterday that the Card yearlings
would probably be too strong for
his team in Saturday's preliminary
to the U.S.C. game. Sweet is faced
with a hard game the succeeding
week with Marin Junior College
and cannyt afford any injuries to
his men.
The Menlo record to date includes
two wins and one loss. Chico State
Teachers College was defeated, 12
to 6, and Salinas Junior College
fell, 39 to 0. However, the junior
collegians from Modesto defeated
Menlo 18 to 7.
Heading Sweet's aggregation is
Ted Corbella, the backfield captain
who carries 220 pounds with him
j when he hits the line from his full
back post. Art Irelan, a shifty right
half, Walt Flanders, a smart quar
terback, and Dick Sparling, who has
had brothers at Stanford and Cali
fornia, complete the backfield.
Perhaps the best of the Menlo
backs—Arnie Anderson of Palo Alto
—won't start the game and probably
won't play. The septums in Ander
son's nose have been battered a bit,
and he is in no shape to play foot
ball.
Allan Fleischacker, Herb's little
brother, will start at center. Fleisch
-1 acker weighed 270 pounds last sum
mer, but has now dwindled away
to a mere 220. Don Giddings, a giant
who weighs but two pounds less
than Herb's little brother, will play
right tackle with Niels Larsen as his
running mate.
El Durant and Don Clarke will
I open at end and Percy Will and Bill
Hart will play guai'd for Menlo. It
is this big, strong line that Sweet
thinks will halt the Card running
. attack.
