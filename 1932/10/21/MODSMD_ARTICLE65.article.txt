# DOC HOOKS 5 TARPON
## 
### 
Dr. A1 Cohan, Milwaukee fisher
man, recently hooked five tarpon
averaging 100 pounds, in two days
of fishing at Fort Myers, Fla. That
makes him about the luckiest fish
erman alive, considering that many
of the bpys spend an entire season
without getting a tarpon strike.

j Plenty ol ghost writers performed
i ior the players during the World
| Series, and some of the boys re-
I ferred to the press stand us "The
i Haunted House."
