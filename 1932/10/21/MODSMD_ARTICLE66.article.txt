Touchdown! A double lateral and
an 80-yard run to a score in the
last minutes oi play climaxed the
close, well-played Phi Kappa Sig
ma-Beta Theta Pi game and gave
the men from the Phi Kap house a
0-0 victory in the intramural touch
football game schedule yesterday
afternoon.
The Breakers grid squad managed
to put over a touchdown in the last
half to win a 7-0 game from the
Delta Tau Delta outfit, while Theta
Xi garnered a 19-6 victory from the
freshmen of Encina !5W in a game
which was far closer than the score
indicated.
Breaking loose in the last minutes
of play with the ball on their 20-
yard line, the men from the Phi
Kaps took to the air in a passing
splurge. On a double lateral from
Jim Irsfelcl to Oliver Martin to
Mark Orr, the Phi Kaps taliied a
touchdown when Orr sprinted four
filths the length of the held for the
six points.
Two plays before this, Jack fcos
grove of the Beta squad received a
punt on his 25-yard stripe. With
his team-mates displaying good in
terference, Cosgrove moved out into
the open and headed for the Phi Kap
goal. After a 45-yard run George
Edmonds touched him from behind
and broke up the Beta's one real
chance for a score. Carroll Toll
played an outstanding game for the
Beta's, while Irsfeld put on a fine
demonstration of blocking and in
terference work.
With both teams in the Breakers-
Delta Tau Delta game exhibiting
j,ood running attacks and with the
clubmen showing a better passing
attack, Carter of the Breakers snag
ged a pass from Red Cross and ran
;;0 yards to the lone touchdown of
the game. On another pass from
Cross, Chuck Coiner accounted for
the extra point for conversion. Art
Azevedo and Gordon of the Break
ers played a good defensive game,
while Johnny Bart let t and McDowell
starred for the Delts.
Although the Theta Xi men de
feated Encina 3W squad 19-6, the
game was more closely played than
the score would indicate. Howard
Hall started the Row team's scoring
with a 15-yard run from scrimmage.
The try for point failed. Hall engi
neered the next touchdown with his
pass'* to Harry Nichols who made 25
yards and a score. Hall converted
with a run.
Down on his own 20-yard mark
Earl Kipp of the Encina outfit de
cided to go into the scoring busi
ness and heaved a 50-yard pass to
Hank Viguie who ran 30 yards to
a touchdown. When the frosli were
later forced back nearly to their
goal line, Viguie fumbled behind the
line and Barry Boland covered the
ball for Theta Xi and added the last
six points to the Row men's score.
