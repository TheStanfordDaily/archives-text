# Gridmen Keep Weight Chart
## 
### 
"Before and after" has long been
a cry of the quack mediciners who
make all sorts of claims as to what
can be done with this or that beauty
cream or how many pounds can be
lost in a short time. The most ac
curate chart of "before and after"
results is hidden in the inner sanc
tum of the men's gym, in the foot
ball squad's, quarters, to be exact.
Here on a wall beside the fre
quently used scale is a pair of
charts which have to do with the
weight of the members of the foot
ball team before practice and again
after their daily workout.
Packard Loses Plenty
All the reducing tablets, creams,
baths, and diets that have ever been
created cannot hold a candle to the
way in which this little daily prac
tice takes the beef off these mighty
behemoths. Dave Packard, 'elon
gated end, seems to shed his weight !
most vehemently, with daily losses
of from five to six pounds being j
recorded. On Thursday, Packard
weighed in at 204, and left the gym
at about 6:30 o'clock with only 199
of these pounds left.
Linemen, on a whole, lose more
weight than members of the back
field. The line's average daily loss
is between three and a half and
four pounds, while the backfield
borders two and a half and three.
Men Gain During Season
Despite this daily shedding of
weight, football practice doesn't
seem to be tearing down the men to
any degree. Evidently, Coach War
ner's men fill up with plenty of
food at the training table each night,
for in almost every case there is an
increase in weight shown since the
beginning of the season.
The exceptions are Ken AfTlcr
haugh, who has lost three pounds,
Corbus, who is minus two, and Jack
Holwerda, down from 214 to 210
pounds. Lee Blanchard shows the
greatest increase in weight, having
gone from 174 to 181 since Septem
ber 26.
