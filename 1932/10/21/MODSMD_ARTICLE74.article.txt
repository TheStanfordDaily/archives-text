# BIG GROUP WORKS UNDER WOLTER IN AUTUMN PRACTICE
## Card Nine May Take Trip Through Orient At End Of Season 
### 
With the largest turnout in sev
eral years and with an enthusiastic
spirit pervading practice, fall base
ball, under the watchful eye of Harry
Wolter, is proving to be a great pro
logue to Stanford's 1933 ball season.
The proposed new model of the
Farm's ball team has a foundation of
eight lettermen on which to build.
Captain Ike Livermore and Jim Mas
scy are the returning catchers. For
pitchers Harry Wolter will have the
services of Stan Anderson, one of the
league's leading moundsmen last
season, and Herm Estes, the Indiana'
Burleigh Grimes.
Veteran Infielclcrs
The infield of the mythical '33
model can boast of Jerry Trautman
at third, Bert Delmas at short, and
Bill Triplett as a man of all trades.
Dick Miles, last season's right fielder,
is the only veteran returning to those
distant meadows of song and prose.
Fast Combination
Four newcomers, Hall, Byrne,
Gailbraith, and Forsythe, who have
worked out together in the infield
are already showing enough class to
warrant serious consideration. The
hitting of Forsythe is enough in it
self to make him a likely prospect.
Besides these Art Hearn, who played
in several games last season at first,
has been showing up better than ever
even though he is also on the soccer
varsity.
No department of the team will
have as strenuous competition as the
outfield where Jim Irsfeld, Tom
Stine, Ed Woodward, John Bacon,
and Holli Matthews are already ex
hibiting mid-season form.
Pitching Prospects
Two naturals have appeared in the
pitching ranks in the persons of Lefty
Campbell, a speed ball artist with
curves, and Dick Armstrong an in
tramural star of last year. Bob Sa
vinskc, last year utility chucker,
looks better than ever and may find
himself in the regular lifieup.
