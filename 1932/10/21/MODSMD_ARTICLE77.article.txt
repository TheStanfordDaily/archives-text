# Triangular Meet Planned
## 
### 
A schedule of hockey, archery,
tennis, and golf in the morning to
be followed by luncheon, a riding
exhibition by the Mills Equitation
Club, and swimming and tennis in
the afternoon has been announced
for the annual Triangular Sports
Day between Mills, California, and
Stanford to be held at Mills next
Saturday.
Competition will be based on the
interclass-intercollegiate plan. Lay
ing aside the theoretical stress laid
on class rather than on college
teams, it must be admitted that
Stanford will be handicapped by
having had only four weeks of prac
tice to Mills' six and California's
nine.
Prospects for hockey arc bright
est, judging by last year's perform -

ance when the Stanford squaws
emerged victorious from the ma
jority of their tilts.
In swimming Stanford will feel
the loss of last year's strong senior
team, for both Mills and Berkeley
have valiant defenders in the two
Vilsach sisters, who have divided
j their allegiance between the two
schools.
! So far only the frosh have a full
i swim team. Mary Anne Crary asks
| any women interested in partici
-1 pating to get in touch with her im
■ mediately.
Although California is famous for
i its tennis players, two Stanford
women should look good in their
matches. They are Helen Fulton and
j Betts Hawkins.
i Archery will be a sad story, for

I only two archers have signed up so
fur. Anyone interested is asked to
communicate with Marion Parker
as soon as possible.
In golf Mai ion Hewlett will rep
resent the seniors; Barbara Young,
the juniors; and Dorothy Lyman, the
freshmen. The sophomore remains
to be chosen.
