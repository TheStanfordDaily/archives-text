# TRICKY OFFENSES FEATURE ATTACKS OF INDIANS, U.S.C.
## Both Teams Use Shifts; Mohler Carries Ball In Trojan Plays 
### Bob Letts 
University of Southern California
depending on an offense that largely
revolves around shifts —
Stanford hoping to befuddle its
opponent with "hidden ball plays"
and having the additional advantage
of a shift—
That's the treat fans have in store
tomorrow afternoon when they
watch the two Pacific Coast Confer
ence elevens clash here.
Jones' Offense Described
Observation of Coach Howard
Jones' offense this season by Scouts
Murray Cuddeback and John Bunn
of Stanford have brought the fol
lowing facts to light:
1 U.S.C. still lines up with three
rows of men after the huddle and
shifts, either once or twice, into po
sition.
2 If there is a second shift, line
men and backs frequently exchange
positions. Sparling's famous end
around play really starts with him
in a halfback position after Mallory
(Pinckert heretofore) shifts up to
end.
3 —On some plays, the Trojan line
deliberately lets opponents sift
through to be blocked out by backs,
the linemen taking out secondary
defense.
4—On others, the play depends on
efficient cross-blocking in the line.
Individual Work Stressed
It all looks clear—on paper—but
the intricate fundamentals taught by
the rival coaches loom much more
important than their respective sys
tems. Reports from the south indi
cate-that U.S.C. still has elementary
things to master. Stanford is not
perfect, but Warner has been devot
ing some time to individual prac
tices under personal supervision of
the coaching stalf—a thing highly
important.
Stanford's offense (the surface of
\t. at least) most students know:
I—Use of a stout line that per
nios the Warner reverses to get un
der way.
2 —Shifts, at times, from Forma
tion A to a modified Formation C.
3—A majority of plays starting
from one formation.
4—Natural, and somewhat com
pulsory, variations as employed on
nearly every team.
Mohler Carries Ball
Howard Jones, so far this year,
has had Orv Mohler carrying the
ball about three-quarters of the
time. "Cotton" Warburton, Mohler's
substitute, has done the same when
he has played.
Practically all of U.S.C.'s plays
have started from a box formation,
with changes now and then to a one
wing back setup on the long side of
the line (the line being unbalanced).
Spinners Featured
Stanford has had the fullback
handling the ball on most of its
plays, with halfbacks generally car
rying it. Reverses have been sud
denly changed into spinner plays,
however, and with the other oddi
ties thrown in, Warner hopes that
his offense will be able to control
the Trojan defense to the extent of
making it spread out or concentrate
in a small area.
Much of this burden will be borne
by Quarterback Gordon Campbell,
who returns tomorrow after several
week's vacation with a weak knee.
He appears in the pink of condition
—physically we know, and mentally
we hope. So far, Gordy has done
well. He can continue.
Southern California had trouble
in the early part of the season get
ting a baekfield to equal its line. The
forward wall is good, no getting
away from that. Jones' "pony back
field" has been the source of some
worry.
Card Backs Good
Warner's scintillating baekfield has
been the source of some pleasure,
more so wit hthe return of Right
Halfback Ernie Caddcl and Camp
bell and the showing last Saturday
of Kenny Affierbaugh and Buck Van'
Dellen.
Confidence reigns here that Stan-
