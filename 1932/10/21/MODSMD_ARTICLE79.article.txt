Cal Clemens (left) 18 year old Southern California baekfield re
cruit described as looking ''good enough to fill Erny Pinkert's shoes
more than somewhat" which is filling something, if you remember
1931. Upper right, Tom Mallory, one of those whose names keep out
of print but who consistently helps make Howard Jones' teams what
they are. He's a blocking half. But you may hear about John Seixas,
another recruit who wasn't eligible last year out is this year. Watch
him at end in those famed Trojan reverses, wnen he appears in tho
lineup. (Associated Press Photo)
