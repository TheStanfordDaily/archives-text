AUBURN,' N.Y., Oct. 20 (IP) — I
Many inmates of Auburn prison
would like to leave the "big house," |
but one who was put on parole i
eight months ago has presented \
himself at the front gate and begged ;
to be taken back inside.
Describing himself as "broke and 1
hungry," he told the warden he had :
tramped from Ohio.
i
"Sorry," said the prison officials,
"but you can't get in."
"Can't you arrest me—say as a!
parole violator?"
The officer telephoned the De- 1
partment of Correction which sane- !
tioned that course, and Mr. X be- |
came a number again in the gray ]
legion of the prison.
Cumberland University, at Leba
non, Tenn., furnished seven generals
lo the Confederacy from among its,
alumni.
