# Indians Picked To Drub U.S.C.
## 
### Maurice Rapf 
There are many people who ven
ture far enough to pick the winners
of football games, but there is only
one gentleman who can pick a win
ner by purely deductive methods.
He must make forecasts without any
influence from an over-zealous stu
dent body or newspaper corps. The
reference is made to that moth
eaten fellow, Mr. Comparative
Score.
Now many people refuse to place
faith in this very mathematical sys
tem, but they lose sight of the fact
that perfect selection depends on
weather conditions.
Verdict Favors Cards
But Stanford fans need not fear
the verdict this year, for compari
son gives the Indians two touch
downs and a field goal over U.S.C.,
and shows that the Stanford margin
of victory has grown with each suc
cessive game of the current season.
U.S.C. opened the season with a
35-0 victory over Utah, which team
later played to a 6-6 tie with
Nevada. St. Mary's has beaten the
Nevadans by 35 points, so the Saints
and the Trojans may be ranked on
an absolutely even basis. St. Mary's
margin of victory over S.F.U. was
10 points, while Stanford won from
the same team by 13. This would
give Stanford a 3-0 win over Troy.
More Statistics
Washington State was the Tro
jans' second victim, falling 20-0.
Washington State and Oregon State
have both played Willamette, the
Oregon boys winning by two points
more than the Cougars. Stanford
beat the Beavers 27-0, and should
be able to add two points to that
total against W.S.C., so we must
figure Stanford nine points better
than the Trojans on a basis of this
second game.
Both teams have played Oregon
State, Stanford winning 27-0 and
Troy, 10-0, so the Cards hold a 17-0
edge.
