# PACIFIC COAST, SOUTHERN TITLES AT STAKE TOMORROW AFTERNOON
## 
### Albert Guerard 
Championship games in all sectors
i feature the biggest football Satur
! day in October tomorrow, with many
I of the nation's undefeated and un
; tied teams certain to fall by the way-
I side.
Stanford and Southern California
I meet in the Stanford Stadium tomor
! row with the Pacific Coast Confer
| ence title at stake. The Indians and
j the Trojans are undefeated and un
! tied, and the result of their annual
! classic will have a large bearing on
[ the mythical national championship.
[ Superior backfield strength has
caused bettors to install Stanford a
| 10-8 favorite, but even money will
; probably be offered at game time.
Whatever record the two teams have
i made prior to their annual battle,
I Stanford and U.S.C. play as though
j fighting for a national title. This
I year they may be doing that very
I thing.
Rice Institute and Texas Univer
sity play at Houston in a game which
will decide the Southwest Confer
ence, and may also play a great part
I in determining national honors. Mid
week odds favored the Longhorns
from Austin, but a last minute switch
in the betting favors the Rice Owls
j because of their superior early sea-
| son record.
Notre Dame, another contender for
universal recognition, faces her first
hard game of the season in Carnegie
Tech of Pittsburg. The Ramblers
have rambled to the extent of 264
; points this season, while keeping
their own goal line uncrossed.
Two of the strongest Eastern
i teams, Harvard and Dartmouth, play

By Albert Guerard

' in Soldier's Field, Cambridge. Har
vard's overwhelming victory over
Penn Slate last Saturday, makes the
Crimson favorite in tomorrow's
game.
Pittsburg's Panthers set out on an
other hard afternoon against Ohio
i State. The Buckeyes played well
against Michigan last Saturday, but
lost 14-0. They will probably hold
! Pittsburg to an even closer score
tomorrow. Fordham-Michigan State,
Colgate-New York University, and
Navy-Princeton are attracting great
attention along the Atlantic Sea
board.
There are few intersectional
games. Marquette .should whip Bos
l ton College in the only important
| game of this type.
The Southern Conference has
. fewer important games than last
Saturday. Tulane's 'Green Wave
should remain undefeated, but they
■ will have a hard game against Au
i ; burn, while Vanderbilt may find
■ 1 Georgia a great deal tougher than
: most people expect.
Purdue and Northwestern tangle
; in the principal Big Ten game. The
i Boilermakers are picked by many as
; 11932 Western Conference champions,
■ 1 but Northwestern, with Pug Rent
ner and Ole Olson in her backfield,
• is no setup. This game is very close
t to a tossup.
California's game with Washing
s ton, and the annual Oregon State
-1 Washington State battle, are attract
-5 ing much attention in the North
west. Both games should be tough,
i very close games with "breaks" the
r deciding factor.

Notre Dame, another contender for

Two of the strongest Eastern
i teams, Harvard and Dartmouth, play

By Albert Guerard

' in Soldier's Field, Cambridge. Har
vard's overwhelming victory over
Penn Slate last Saturday, makes the
Crimson favorite in tomorrow's
game.
Pittsburg's Panthers set out on an
other hard afternoon against Ohio
i State. The Buckeyes played well
against Michigan last Saturday, but
lost 14-0. They will probably hold
! Pittsburg to an even closer score
tomorrow. Fordham-Michigan State,
Colgate-New York University, and
Navy-Princeton are attracting great
attention along the Atlantic Sea
board.
There are few intersectional
games. Marquette .should whip Bos
l ton College in the only important
| game of this type.
The Southern Conference has
. fewer important games than last
Saturday. Tulane's 'Green Wave
should remain undefeated, but they
■ will have a hard game against Au
i ; burn, while Vanderbilt may find
■ 1 Georgia a great deal tougher than
: most people expect.
Purdue and Northwestern tangle
; in the principal Big Ten game. The
i Boilermakers are picked by many as
; 11932 Western Conference champions,
■ 1 but Northwestern, with Pug Rent
ner and Ole Olson in her backfield,
• is no setup. This game is very close
t to a tossup.
California's game with Washing
s ton, and the annual Oregon State
-1 Washington State battle, are attract
-5 ing much attention in the North
west. Both games should be tough,
i very close games with "breaks" the
r deciding factor.
Championship games in all sectors
i feature the biggest football Satur
! day in October tomorrow, with many
I of the nation's undefeated and un
; tied teams certain to fall by the way-
I side.
Stanford and Southern California
I meet in the Stanford Stadium tomor
! row with the Pacific Coast Confer
| ence title at stake. The Indians and
j the Trojans are undefeated and un
! tied, and the result of their annual
! classic will have a large bearing on
[ the mythical national championship.
[ Superior backfield strength has
caused bettors to install Stanford a
| 10-8 favorite, but even money will
; probably be offered at game time.
Whatever record the two teams have
i made prior to their annual battle,
I Stanford and U.S.C. play as though
j fighting for a national title. This
I year they may be doing that very
I thing.
Rice Institute and Texas Univer
sity play at Houston in a game which
will decide the Southwest Confer
ence, and may also play a great part
