# Will Rogers Says U.S. Needs Gigolo Tariff

BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 20 (/?)â€”
Will Rogers, who was the guest of
the American colony at a dinner last
night, said he was "America's gift to
those who didn't sec the Prince of
Wales."
"I'm here to lower the tariff," the
humorist said. "Argentina exports
wheat, meat and gigolos, and the
United States puts a tariff on the
wrong two."
He recalled how he came to Ar
gentina in 1901, with money he had
earned selling cattle, and found him
self unable to hold a job as an Ar
gentine cowboy. He lived in Buenos
Aires until his money was all gone,
he said, then worked his way to
Africa on a cattle boat and joined a
wild west show.
