# BIG GUNS IN TROJAN OFFENSIVE
## 
### 

These are three reasons why Coach Jones
expects to carry the fight to the Cards. Right
End Ford Palmer (top left) started the scor
ing against Washington State and Oregon
State. Running Guard Aaron (Rosy) Rosen
berg is one of Troy's best blockers. Homer
Griffith (below) can play either quarter or
fullback, and will probably start in Orv
Mohler's place. He is the nearest approach
to S.C.'s All-American Gaius Shaver of last
year. (Courtesy P.A. Times)
