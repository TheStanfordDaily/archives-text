# A.I.E.E. WATCHES IMPULSE VOLTAGE
## 
### 
Two hundred members of the
Stanford and San Francisco chap
ters of the American Institute of
(Electrical Engineers attended a joint
banquet in Stanford Union and a
demonstration of high voltage Wed
nesday night in the Harris J. Ryan
electrical laboratory of the Univer
sity.
The engineers watched Dr. Joseph
Carroll of Ihe Stanford faculty de-
I velop an impulse voltage, similar to
I that of lightning strokes, of 3,000,000
volts.
The force of the voltage, produced
by recently installed equipment in
the Ryan laboratory, was sufficient
to shatter a four-by-four timber
into splinters and to melt a 60-foot
! copper wire, which has a heat re
sistance of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Six 350,000-volt transformers are
! used in building up the artificial
lightning, which is to be used soon
I for testing insulation on the trans
mission line that will bring electric
j current from Boulder Dam.
