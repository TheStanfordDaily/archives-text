### Ellamae Dodds 
Dino Borgioli, famous Italian
tenor, will open the Associated Stu
dents Concert Series with his ap
pearance in the Stanford Pavilion
Wednesday evening at 8:20 o'clock.
Acclaimed by the San Francisco
Opera audiences for his appearances
in grand opera there during the past
month, Borgioli has sung so many
times in royal courts that he has
been nicknamed "the tenor of
kings." When the Lisbon Opera
House had its reopening after being
closed for twelve years out of re
spect to the memory of the assassi
nated King Carlos, Borgioli was the
protagonist in "Faust."
Sings For Royalty
He was also (he tenor selected to
sing in performances given in Rome
in honor of the King and Queen of
England during their last visit there,
and for other performances in honor
of the King of Belgium, the King of
Egypt and the King of Sweden.
In a recent revival of Mascagni's
"L'Amica Fritz," the composer se
lected Borgioli for the title role, and,
bringing him to the footlights at the
end of the opening performance,
hailed him as "the complete tenor."
In Pamplona, Spain, the birthplace
of Gayarre, famous Spanish tenor,
Borgioli sang "La Favorita," an
opera that had not been heard there
since the death of Gayarre. His
success was so overwhelming that
the Spaniards hailed Borgioli as the
"Gayarre of today."
Native of Florence
The artist is a native of Florence,
and it whs in that part of Italy that
he first began his musical studies.
Since that time he has had a wide
and brilliant career in which he has
become a favorite in both European
and American concert and opera.

concert series may still bp had, or
