# Only 20 Turn Out For Yearling Debate Squad
## 
### 
Unlike their upper class brethren,
| the freshmen have not turned out
for the yearling debate squad in as
large numbers as formerly. Only 20
aspirants appeared for tryouts
Thursday evening; of these 16 have
• been tentatively accepted. They will
j meet tonight at 7:30 in room 201.
I Coach Virgil Anderson blames the
! small turnout on the fact that the
! freshman class has been swamped
i with various class activities ever
! since school opened, so that many
| have been unable to prepare for the
I tryouts. He therefore urges any first
year man who is interested in the
oratorical pastime, to come to his
office at Room 200 D.
