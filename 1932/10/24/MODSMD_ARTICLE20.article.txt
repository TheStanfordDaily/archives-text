# TRIALS TONIGHT FOR GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club will hold
tryouts at 7:15 o'clock tonight for
those men who were unable to at
tend the first trials last week, Don
Morgan, president, announced last
night. The club meets in its own
room in the old Roble gym, and will
hold a regular rehearsal in conjunc
tion with tonight's tryouts.
Both singers and pianists are
eligible to compete in the trials and
those who pass will be admitted to
the club on a temporary basis, sub
ject to further testing.
