# MEIER TO TALK ON ART GENIUS
## Psychologist Will Speak Tomorrow At 7:30 
### 
Norman Charles Meier, psycholo
gist and artist of the University of
lowa, will explain the fundamentals
of artistic genius tomorrow night,
when he speaks in the Little Theatre
at 7:30 o'clock.
The professor has acquired a na
tional reputation for his develop
ment of research techniques for art
psychology. In 1922 Meier proposed
the thesis that aesthetic judgment
was of first importance in artistic
talent. This capacity to sense value
in composition is more fundamental
than (he motor skills or aptitude in
technique and color harmony.
Illustrated Lecture
The illustrated lecture tomorrow
night will be based on research
which began in 1927 to discover the
origins of artistic talent in the pre
school child. Experimenting with
these children, Dr. Meier has found
that artistic environment cannot be
given as an adequate explanation of
talent. For he found that the aes
thetic stimulus at home was only
slightly better for the talented.
Special case studies showed that
the talented child is more observ
ant, retentive, and self-critical. He
exceeds the non-talented in mem
ory for form, in visual discrimina
tion, and inventiveness.
Talent Shown Early
Especially significant in the tests
was the fact that children between
the ages of five and seven demon
strated unmistakeable evidences of
artistic maturity. Good space filling,
balance, unity, and good proportion
ing were particularly evident.
"These qualities," says Meier, "sug
gest an untaught sensing of artistic
values. They are seldom found in
products of the untalented."
Professor Meier, a member of the
Executive Committee of Ihe Con
ference for Research in Art, is the
co-deviser of the Meier-Seashore
Art Judgment Test. This particular
test is the standard for the artistic
experiments.
