# POUNDAGE AND PASSES OBTAIN TROJAN VICTORY
## Stanford, Outweighed But Not Outfought, Loses To U.S.C., 13-0 
### Bob Wade 
Twenty-three scalp-hunting In
j dians found twenty-three big, ex
! perieneed Trojans in Stanford St a -
I dium Saturday, and while 54,000
I astonished people looked on, the
j battering rams of Troy shattered
I the stout-hearted defense and the
j twin-spinner attack of Stanford's
j favored eleven to level for another
; year the resistance built up by
i Medicine Man Warner. The final
I score was 13 to 0.
Tossing off every possible penalty
| end break that could go against
I them, the mighty Trojans struck
| twice with lightning rapidity, and
, then flung back everything that the
1 Redshirts could shoot against them.
Cards Start Fast
Stanford had an opening live min
| utes of glory that brought cheer to
the hearts of the touchdown-hungry,
as Jack Hillman's quick-kick, Bill
Sim's 22-yard dash, and Old Man
Penalty threw the invaders back
I against their goal. But Troy built
j up its wall in the space of one short
time-out, and Stanford failed as the
team tried to make a fourth down
through Ernie Smith.
They battled back and forth until
J well into the second period and then
I with the ball near the sidelines,
j Jones sent in McNeish, who docs
j some of the best passing on the
i coast, and he sent one over Sim's
! head into the waiting hands of Ford
Palmer. SCORE: SC. <3, STAN
FORD 0.
Warburton Gets Two Chances
Stanford kicked off at the start
! of the second half and Warburton
j ran the ball back o0 yards, but
(someone was offside and Warbur
j ton took the repeat back a mere
I twelve.
The teams pushed each other back
; and forth until Griffith kicked to
the Stanford 3-yard stripe.
Stanford returned the kick to
Mohler, who ran back to the fifty.
! Griffith hit the line, Clark passed
! to Palmer, who was downed on the
I 9-yard line. Mohler hit the line fir
; four yards, and Griffith took it over,
j Smith converted this one. His first
had been wide.
Too Much Beef
Stanford's line was outweighed
nearly fifteen pounds to the man. Its
fight was just as good as that, of the
Trojan forward wall. Its coaching
was just as good, but it couldn't
stand up under the beating admin
istered by that added poundage,
i U.S.C. caught Stanford flat-footed
j twice, apd it scored both times. The
! second trip needed a little extra
j push, but it was just as decisive as
I the first score.
Stanford outguessed the visitors
ijust once, on the first kick, which
jset them back for the moment. But
| when Stanford failed to score in the
! opening minutes of play, the end
! was already in sight.
Rosenberg and Smith!
The Cards failed to mix their open
' game with their wizardry. There
! were times when it looked as if
! Rosenberg and Smith were calling
; the plays. They never gave a passer
j a chance to get a throw away with
i out being hurried. They covered
Don Colvin all afternoon. He got.
away with his one pass, and that
| was all.
It; wasn't a case of Stanford not
cashing in on scoring opportunities.
The team only got one, and that
| wasn't such a big one at that.
The Indians were outsmarted,
i outkicked, and outpassed, but they
! fought as well as they could against
the odds and they are far from
1 through as a team. When the re
! verses get some timing they will be
unstoppable to anyone but. S.C.

Too Much Beef
Stanford's line was outweighed

fight was just as good as that, of the
Trojan forward wall. Its coaching
was just as good, but it couldn't
stand up under the beating admin

j twice, apd it scored both times. The

ijust once, on the first kick, which
jset them back for the moment. But

Rosenberg and Smith!
The Cards failed to mix their open
' game with their wizardry. There

; the plays. They never gave a passer
j a chance to get a throw away with
i out being hurried. They covered
Don Colvin all afternoon. He got.
away with his one pass, and that

It; wasn't a case of Stanford not

The team only got one, and that

The Indians were outsmarted,

unstoppable to anyone but. S.C.
