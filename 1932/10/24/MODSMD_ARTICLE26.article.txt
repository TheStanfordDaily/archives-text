# HANGOVER....
## 
### 
I( lias been said that man must set lip for his own per
sonal use an explanation of some sort for everything or
drift aimlessly with mind rendered ineffectual by the pres
ence within it of a flock of unanswerable "whys." Who
said it, or when, matters little; but the wisdom of its phi
losophy can he attested by a lot of weary Slanfordites who
are today roaming the. Farm with minds jumbled in the
confusion of the worst football hangover on record.
Alter live long years, Trov was to fall. After five long
years the emotional safety valve was to be thrown wide to
alleviate in a hurst of joy, feelings that had been accumu
lated and compressed, accumulated and compressed from
autumn to autumn without relief. The shock, the stark
suddenness with which Saturday's gridiron nightmare
awoke an optimistic student body from the sweetest of
dreams was sufficient almost to derange the mind of any
normal undergraduate.
Sports writers, gridiron analysts, may be able to explain
the defeat to the satisfaction of the man who understands
the game. Thai man can go his way with mind at rest,
free to work and play.
It is the poor fellow who didn't know why or how a
football game is won, but believed implicitly the experts
who predicted that the Indian famine was to end and pre
pared his emotional structures accordinglyâ€”he is the man
who is today suffering the agony of futile groping for ex
planation.
It may be over-emphasis. It may be true, what they say
about student enthusiasm for football, in comparison to
student enthusiasm for ed'ucatioii, being warped out of all
proportion.
Mul whatever it is, there is need for Ihe philosophical
altitude on the Farm today.
