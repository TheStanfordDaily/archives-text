# YOUR CHANCE TO VOTE

### 
Scores of Stanford students, anent their lower division I
(raining in citizenship, who have neglected to register fori
November X or will neglect to vote on that day, are being!
given a convenient opportunity to express their presidential
preferences in ballot form. Straw voles are usually a lot
of fun, luil the Daif.y's straw vote, scheduled for tomorrow 1
and Wednesday, promises to be more than that.
The results of our campus poll will furnish the first
tangible bit of evidence as to whither undergraduate
opinion is turning under the influences and pressures of!
student political organizations. At the same time the ballot
totals will provide the leaders of these political groups with
definite information concerning their progress. Because
of Stanford's unique position in this presidential contest,!
the campus straw vote may prove very interesting, even
significant, to the casual observer. Ho will learn how well
the Hoover faction luis held its ground in this traditional
hotbed of Republicanism against the tides of dissatisfac
tion with the Hoover administration. He will discover how
much headway Thomas supporters have made in their
crusading campaign for intelligently-cast voles. He will
get ;i good idea of the native strength of Democratic senti
ment by the polling for Roosevelt, for those votes will be i
cast without the persuasion of an clt'ective student organi
zation.
Somebody surely ought to congratulate the University
administration for its broadminded attitude in permitting
free and frank discussion of the present political issues,
which include the success or failure of the presidential!
administration of one of the Stanford trustees. For, after I
all, were Roosevelt or Thomas to win the straw vote, that
would be News.
