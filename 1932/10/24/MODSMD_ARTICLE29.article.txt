little job like kids around a Christ
mas tree at 6 o'clock on THE morn
ing. Now, of coui'se, if these women
were to do the work in anything
like a businesslike fashion, the re
sults would be calamitous. For soon
the women would have to go back
to their bread-puddings and their
i vegetable soups. Fortunately, noth
ing so cataclysmic ever happens. The
pot of women's club activities con
i tinues to bubble and boil—with
myriads of clubwomen stirring the
gruel with their highly polished
little finger nails.
So long as the activity is within
their own midst, no particular harm
results. Those who look on, laugh at
the fun; but aside from that all is
well. Sometimes, however (and here
is where the rubbing' begins), these
women get into activities where
people from outside the fussing co
, terie must act with them.
Then, their old crotchety notions
and bustling antics cease to be
amusing and become aggravatingly
evident. Nothing, I suppose, can be
. done about it. It's impossible to lock
j women up in their parlors and pan
trys; contact will come and the ava
i lanche of disgust that results must
also come. The sad thing is that
women—who basically are supposed
to be intellectually equal with men
—should suffer such a retrogression
of their brain processes and salifi
cation of their sense of proportion
just because the kitchen has once
, branded them. —Abe Mellinkoff
