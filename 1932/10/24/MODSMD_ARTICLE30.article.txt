CAVALLEIRA RUSTICANA and I
PAGLIACCI. At the War Memor
ial Opera House.
These performances hardly meas
ured up to the high standard set by
other operas this season. Claudia
Muzio, singing both leads, did not
sing as well as in Tosca, although
her acting was excellent; her high
notes were too loud and sharp, and
some were disagreeably shrill. As
in Tosca, she made up for this by
the rich tone of her low notes.
Mario Chamlee as Turiddu was
also not at his best. He underacted
at the first, and overdid his last
scene. His singing was competent.
Alfredo Gandolfi was an unenthusi
astic Alfio, being in all respects
poorer than he was in Tosca and
Lucia.
I Pagliacci introduced a new
tenor, Tandy MacKenzie, who, while
not startling, was thoroughly com
petent. His Canio was restrained and
dignified, and he got full emotional
effect without resorting to wild his
trionics. His voice was full and
pleasing always.
Richard Bonelli received the usual
applause for singing the Prolog, but
his whole performance lacked the
brilliance of his Rigoletto. Terry
Lefranconi and Marsden Argall as
Beppo and Silvio were adequate,
the former doing an excellent sere
nade.
The best feature of the perform
ances was good acting by most of
the principals—a commendation
which hardly applies to the chor
uses. In both operas the chorus is
continually filtering in and out in a
stiff manner; therefore the fact that'
it appeared awkward cannot be
blamed on the performers. However,

I for ragged singing, there was not so j
much excuse. —C.A.Z.
