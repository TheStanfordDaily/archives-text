; The Editor, Sir:
How about the stifling, oppressive
i atmosphere of our otherwise most
serviceable libiary? How, in the
j name of all that makes Phi Betes
I study, is one expected to be able to
' pore over reference volumes in a!
climate comparable to that of the
Sahara desert in the middle of sum
i mer minus the fresh air?
If any one thinks this is a mis
| statement of the truth, let him visit
I the library and note the drowsy
! bending of heads on tables and the
: tremendous effort it takes those
I who do so to keep their attention I
' focused on the works they have j
j come to study.

Is there any reasonable reason for I
all this unnecessary heat? Perhaps !
not a few of the annual crop of fall- ■
quarter colds can be attributed to !
change in temperature from the
stuffy air of the library to that of
the outside air.
Any action taken to correct this
fault would, I feel sure, be wel
comed by most users of the library.
