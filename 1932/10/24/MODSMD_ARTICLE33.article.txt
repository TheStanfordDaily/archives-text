Stock averages closed Saturday at
64.05, off 4.10 from a week ago. Vol
| ume was less than 500,000 shares. 1
With only twelve full trading days
i left before elections the traders are ,
! wary and opposed to any prolonged
commitments. It is entirely prob- i
; able that trading until election will j
; confine itself to a small variation.
I from figures as of the last close.
This column will use, henceforth,
j a new basis for daily averages: Al-
I lied Chemical & Dye, American j
Telephone, Atchison, Topeka & j
' Santa Fe, Consolidated Gas, Gen
j eral Motors, International Tele- |
I phone, Standard Oil Company of (
I California, United Aircraft, United
; States Steel, Westinghouse Electric.
' Saturday's close for this group was ;
• 39.70. 1932 high was 59.45, low was j
; 23.10.
Although Roosevelt's last speech j
| was designated to assure security j
i holders of Democracy's conserva- |
, tism, Wall Street looks upon Hoover j
! more favorably. While odds against ;
i Hoover are now around 2 1 -»-l, his |
j re-election is not as improbable as
' these figures would insinuate. Re- I
I garding a certain newspaper chain's |
j straw poll—Hoover will win if he !
I carries those states in which the poll
I now shows him to have 44% or
! more of the votes.
A market letter out of New York,
: designed for professional traders, ;
! stresses the point that best prices {
! on rallies are usually reached on the j
i fii'st and second days of these ral- j
! lies. The implication apparently is j
that profits should be realized at the
| start of the rallies rather than hold
-1 ing commitments through a week

or two in hope of fractional in
creases.
In repeatedly terming the present
market a strictly professional one, I
mean to convey the idea that prices
are determined by trading groups
who take Short or Long positions for
only a few points profit. Shorts go
in on rallies and Longs take up
stocks on slight dips. Likewise, this
trading is almost entirely confined
to the more popular stocks, such as
used for this column's daily average,
to afford traders quick execution of
orders without violent effect upon
the particular stock's market price.
