WELL, NOW THAT U.S.C. is
out of the way, maybe we can
go on with our season and win
a couple of games. That is an
annual hahit that we would sure
like to break. These Los Angeles
guys will be getting to think
that they play better football
than we do if we don't heat
them pretty soon. (Are you lis
nen, Mr. Gerlich?)
This Rosenberg person played as
f he were onto our signals. Ernie
Smith toow care of anyone who tar
ied behind the line of scrimmage,
/hile Rosy .sal on anyone who came
hrough.
While we are dealing in linemen
vho upset the someday-big-red
nachine, we wish to crow over ONE
i our many predictions (ouch!)
/hich came out right. The S.C. ends
)ID come through with a game that
eft the scoreboard gasping in
mazement, and the crowd locking
or the guy who said they would be
iiitplayed.
SORT OF LOOKS AS IF our
"cousins" over at Berkeley had
begun to wake tip. Washington,
if one may believe the scribes in
Seattle, is nobody's pushover,
but the Bear used his head and
came home with somewhat of
an upset (even if our staff op
timist DID pick the darn game
correctly).
Some funny man wanted to know
fter the game whether California
vould have a chance against El
,'rojan. We should answer! After
Dtting our Steenford spirit carry us
ft' into the mire of bum predictions,
ye have nothing to predict from
ow on!
However, we will go on record as
hinking that if the California line
lays up to its potential ability, the
outhern steamroller should have an
wfn I lot of trouble. The Bears are
heavy bunch, if they want to be,
nd they have a mob of fancy
layers. They ought to be one of the
est teams on the coast, and if they
ave finally started on the up-grade,
;e will have one terrible time
ringing any bear hide back to the
ampus next month, when the In
ian hits the Berkeley trail.
"POP" WARNER AND HOW
ARD JONES were made Deputy
Fire Marshalls during a dinner
at International Fire Chief
George Whitell's house last
night. They were given solid
gold badges, studded with dia
monds and rubies, by State Fire
Marshall Jay Stevens (father of
Stanford's fullback, and S.C.'s
guard) who made the presenta- I
tion in the absence of Governor I
Rolph, kept in Sacramento by
pressure of state business.
