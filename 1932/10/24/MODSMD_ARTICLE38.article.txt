# Six Straight for Frosh as Menlo Loses, 19-0
## ALL SCORES MADE IN FIRST HALF AS BRONSTEIN STARS Most Regulars Given Rest For S.C. Game; Reisner Hurt At Start 
### Dick Strouse 
Failing to lose their pants or any
prestige, Stanford's freshman foot
ball eleven were extremely inhos
pitable to their neighbors from
Menlo Junior College Saturday, de->
feating the visitors 19 to 0. That
was the first game of the season in
which at least one Card did not
have his dusty moleskins torn from
his own skin by the clawing hands
of opponents, and the sixth straight
win for the babes.
Oil the first play of the game an
ambitious Menloite attempted to
force Johnny Reisner to part with
his padded leggings, but succeeded
instead in forcing Reisner to fall
with unexpected fury on the not-so
soft green. Reisner left the game
then because an ankle buckled be
neath him; the seriousness of the
injury will not be known until X
rays are developed.
Bronstcin Wanders Around
Instrumental in two of the Stan
ford scores was Sheldon Bronstein,
a talented back who played both
right and left half Saturday, al
though not at the same time. Bron
stein caught a lateral thrown by
Bones Hamilton early in the first
quarter and scampered 20 yards to
score. Hamilton had gone through
the line and was apparently tackled
when he whirled and hurled the
pork-chop-that-didn't-materialize to
Bronstein.
Hamilton scored the second one
himself, intercepting a flat pass on
his own 10-yard line and obtaining
his afternoon's workout while run
ning to the distant goal-line. Bron
stein then came right back, catch
ing a punt and Weaving, wandering,
and warding oft Menlo players by |
skillful use of his interferers, his,
run totaling 45 yards.
Carlson and Bardin
Coach Winterburn started a mixed
first and second team, and had the
rest of his "horses" ready to go
when Menlo reached the 15-yard
line. But Menlo was stopped, and
for the rest of the game Chuck sub
stituted his third- and fourth-string
men, thus accounting for the score
less second half.
Bill Bardin's young brother stood
out in the line, as did Swede Carl
son, big, blond tackle who made the
game's only conversion. Gordy Mai- j
latratt showed that he is learning
more about football every day, and j
George Leedy played perhaps the j
best game of his Stanford career j
alter he once got going.
