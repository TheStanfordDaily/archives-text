# ROAMING KITTEN MEANS LOSS OF D.G.'S ONLY TUX
## 
### 
Great is the sorrow at the
house of Delta Gamma, for
their only Tuxedo has been
missing since Wednesday night,
when someone inadvertently
left an outside door open.
Lest some risible reader be
inclined to scofT at the idea of
a tuxedo in a sorority house,
we hasten to explain that this
tuxedo is a playful black kitten
sporting white whiskers, white
paws, and white chest.
He is too young to be out
alone catting around; won't
some kind soul find and return
him to his anxious owners?
