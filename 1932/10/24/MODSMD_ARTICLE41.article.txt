Touch-tackle teams in the intra
mural grid season schedule are
booming through the center of the
line for the second week of play
and Round II in the schedule.
Flashy runs by Ike Hables, last
year's varsity track captain, put the
finishing touches to the Phi Psi-
Sequoia I game last Friday after
noon when the men from up the
Row combined passes and Hables'
sprints to triumph 14 to 7. The
Kappa Sigs pushed over their 13-7
victory against Sigma Alpha Epsilon
by brandishing a strong aerial at
tack, while the men from Sigma Nu
walked away with a 21-0 win from
the clubmen of Los Arcos.
Starting the scoring in the Se
quoia-Phi Psi game, Bob Mathew
from the hallmen heaved a pass to
Bob Twaddel which resulted in a
40-yard gain and Sequoia's lone
touchdown. The Phi Psi men re
taliated in spectacular style. George
Latimer heaved a pass 20 yards to
Ike Hables, who caught the pigskin,
dodged Sequoia men, and hit his

J stride for 60 yards and a touch
; down.
Unities Again
After runs by Hables had brought
; the ball down deep into the Sequoia
territory, Latimer on a run gained
10 yards and a touchdown. The
I passing duet, Latimer and Hables,
; went into action again and earned
j the extra point for conversion.
Alternate passes and runs brought
| the Kappa Sigs in the Kappa Sig
j S.A.E. game deep into the enemy's
territory. Jack Redhead on a 20-
| yard pass from Bert Dclmas stepped
! over the goal and tallied a touch
â€¢ down. Later in the s?me half a pass
i from Delmas to Jack King, good for
; 35 yards, ended in the second touch
; down for the Kappa Sigs. A pass
| from Hamer Budge to Norm Been
f'eldt completed an S.A.E. drive, and
I supplied the loser's only touchdown.
! Bill Triplett of S.A.E. played a good
game both defensively and offen
sively.
Linden Runs to Score
Throughout the Sigma Nu-Lcts
Arcos game the men from up the
1 Row seemed to have the situation
, well in hand. Jim Mullen of Sigma
j Nu started the fireworks when he
I received a 25-yard pass from Bob
! Polhamus and ran 40 yards to a
j touchdown.
A pass from Charlie Glasgow to
; Harry Parkin, good for 20 yards,
| made the second touchdown for the
: Row men. Sid Linden on a short run
! accounted for the third score and
j later the extra point.
; Madden of the Los Arcos outfit
stood cut for his passing ability,
while Andy Harris of the eating
club played a good all-around
game.
