# CARD SOCCER WINS ENDED BY AUDACIOUS S.F.U. DONS
## 
### 
Ruining a very nice and appar- (
ently healthy Stanford record of no
soccer defeats in two seasons of
play, S.F.U. had the audacity Sat
urday morning to score four goals
against Harry Maloncy's pedal art-,
ist.s, while Harry Maloney's pedal i
artists were scoring but one goal i
against S.F.U.
The Stanford defeat was due in i
general to a better S.F.U. team and
specifically to the co-operation of,
the Don forwards. Similar in unison i
if not in appearance to a Ziegfield
chorus, the invading line scored'
once on a kick that bounced off a '
Stanford man's head, once on a kick '
that bounced away from a goal
post, and twice on shots too hard for
Goalie Newman, who played well,
to handle.
Outside of the first quarter, the
teamwork of the Stanford forward j
line was helping Byrd rediscover I
the South Pole. The only Card score i
came when the referee called a goal
by Gas Rojas a corner kick, andj
Sven Doddington, enraged by the j
unfairness of it all, booted a perfect j

! corner kick to the top of Art Hearn s
head, from whence it bounced with
in the elusive net.
Encouraging from the point of
view of the future of Stanford soc
i cer—if not from that of his substi
| tute—was the playing of Laurie
] Washburn at center half. Laurie
filled this hitherto unfilled key po
' sition expertly, and Bill Krumbein,
.shifted about all year, finally found
j his niche at fullback and played up
|to the standard set by. the team's
: newly elected captain, Blondie
Brekelbaum.
