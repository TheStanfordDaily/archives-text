portant on the Stanford campus.
Her three main reasons were: first,

ford organization which goes be
yond the campus; second, that a
trained secretary shows the mem
bers how to really get something out
of committee work; and third, that
the Y.W.C.A.'s written purpose pro
vides a standard by which to meas
ure work done both by the indi
vidual and by all the campus or
ganizations.
