# INGRAM'S STRATEGY RESPONSIBLE FOR BEAR VICTORY OVER HUSKIES
## 
### DICK RODDA 
Ignoring the fact that they were i
up against the only undefeated |
eleven in the Northwest, the Cali- i
fornia Bear once more came through !
as the underdog, fighting his way '
to a 7 to 6 victory over the Wash
ington Huskies and re-establishing
himself as a contender for the con- 1
ference crown.
The Bears also forgot that they j
were playing at Seattle in the rain, j
for under such conditions the Hus- j
kies are supposed to be unbeatable, j
But it was a little of Bill Ingram's
psychology that really won for j
California.
Here's Bill's Psychology
Washington had awaited an at- j
tack lead by Hank Schaldach but,
to their surprise, found that the j
California general for this game was
Arleigh Williams.
The Huskies opened the scoring j
with a touchdown in the first quar- |
ter obtained by means of a pass. I

i Then early in the second period
| Ingram sent Williams into the game
! in place of Schaldach and the Wash-
I ington fans gave a sigh of relief
i only to find in a very few moments
: that Mr. Williams was not a dead
! spark plug.
The Bears took the ball on Wash
-1 ington's 47-yard line after several
| sustained drives led by Williams
i had failed.
One Play Wins
From this point, however, one
j play was enough for a score. Wil
: liams drove through the line to find
■ beautiful interference waiting to
j take out the secondary defense while
i he squirmed his way through to the
j goal line.
And as the Bears lined up to con
| vert, the Huskies were given an
other surprise. Williams stepped
; back to drop-kick, but instead of
kicking, he threw a pass to Castro,
, who was waiting unmolested in the
I corner of the end zone.
