# SATURDAY'S PLAY LEAVES BUT THIRTEEN FOOTBALL TEAMS UNBEATEN AND UNTIED
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
The Trojans and U.C.L.A. in the |
West. Harvard, Colgate, Pennsyl- !
vania, Columbia, Brown, and Holy
Cross in the East. Michigan and >
Notre Dame in the Midwest. Texas
Christian, Tennesseee, and Virginia j
Poly in the South.
These thirteen teams, the cream ]
of the nation's football talent, re- j
main undefeated and untied at the i
conclusion of the season's sixth hard
weekend. Stanford, Pittsburgh, and
Rice were the most important teams
to fall for the first time. The In- i
dians challenged U.S.C.'s Pacific
Coast Conference supremacy and j
lost, 13-0. Pittsburgh was held to a •
scoreless tie by Ohio State. Rice's j
Owls met Texas University for the
Southwest Conference champion- j
ship, and were defeated 18-6.
Eastern Schedule Lighter
Though the unbeaten and untied .
are more numerous along the At- !
lantic Seaboard, this day may bo
attributed to easier early season
schedules rather to any marked :
gridiron superiority. Harvard and
Colgate are the only Eastern elevens ;
with more than an even chance of .
finishing the season with perfect,
records, but even Harvard must j
still contend with Army's developing
team, and Colgate plays Brown on j
Thanksgiving Day.
Harvard was lucky to beat Dart
mouth 10-7 yesterday, as Yale's un
fortunate eleven was being whipped
by Army 20-0. Colgate defeated ,
New York University 14-0, while,
Pennsylvania and Columbia were I
smothering Lehigh and Williams. I
The two big Eastern upsets were: j
Pittsburgh 0, Ohio State 0; Michi
gan State 19, Fordham 13.
Michigan Stands Out
Notre Dame swamped Carnegie |
Tech 42-0. The Ramblers, powered ;
by George Melinkovitch, Nick Luk
ats, and Mike Koken, have scored •
268 points in four games, while j
keeping their own goal line un- |
crossed.
Michigan University, more power
ful with each Saturday's passing, |
loomed as almost certain winner of I
the Western Conference champion- !
ship, by defeating Illinois 32-0, while !
Purdue's Boilermakers, hitherto co- j
favorites, were being held to a one- ;
touchdown tie by Northwestern.
Football's veteran fans throughout

the countre rejoiced to hear of Chi
cago's 13-7 victory over Indiana.
A. A. Stagg's Maroons are now oc
cupying a very precarious rung at
the country rejoiced to hear of Chi-
Michigan. The two teams meet on
November 12, and even if Chicago
is still undefeated at. that time,
which is very unlikely, Michigan's
Wolverines would be almost certain
to win.
Texas U Favored
- Although Texas Christian is still
undefeated, Texas University, beat
en once in non-conference play, be
came the Southwest Conference fa
vorite as a result of her convincing
victory over the Rice Owls. Virginia
Poly won her fourth hard game in
as many weeks, Centenary defeated
Southern Methodist easily. Tulane's
Green Wave was definitely elimi
nated by Auburn, and William and
Mary won her annual "Big Game"
with Washington and Lee by a 7-0
score.

The two big Eastern upsets were: j

Michigan Stands Out
Notre Dame swamped Carnegie |
Tech 42-0. The Ramblers, powered ;
by George Melinkovitch, Nick Luk
ats, and Mike Koken, have scored •
268 points in four games, while j
keeping their own goal line un- |
crossed.
Michigan University, more power
ful with each Saturday's passing, |
loomed as almost certain winner of I
the Western Conference champion- !
ship, by defeating Illinois 32-0, while !
Purdue's Boilermakers, hitherto co- j
favorites, were being held to a one- ;
touchdown tie by Northwestern.
Football's veteran fans throughout

the countre rejoiced to hear of Chi
cago's 13-7 victory over Indiana.
A. A. Stagg's Maroons are now oc
cupying a very precarious rung at
the country rejoiced to hear of Chi-
Michigan. The two teams meet on
November 12, and even if Chicago
is still undefeated at. that time,
which is very unlikely, Michigan's
Wolverines would be almost certain
to win.
Texas U Favored
- Although Texas Christian is still
undefeated, Texas University, beat
en once in non-conference play, be
came the Southwest Conference fa
vorite as a result of her convincing
victory over the Rice Owls. Virginia
Poly won her fourth hard game in
as many weeks, Centenary defeated
Southern Methodist easily. Tulane's
Green Wave was definitely elimi
nated by Auburn, and William and
Mary won her annual "Big Game"
with Washington and Lee by a 7-0
score.
The Trojans and U.C.L.A. in the |
West. Harvard, Colgate, Pennsyl- !
vania, Columbia, Brown, and Holy
Cross in the East. Michigan and >
Notre Dame in the Midwest. Texas
Christian, Tennesseee, and Virginia j
Poly in the South.
These thirteen teams, the cream ]
of the nation's football talent, re- j
main undefeated and untied at the i
conclusion of the season's sixth hard
weekend. Stanford, Pittsburgh, and
Rice were the most important teams
to fall for the first time. The In- i
dians challenged U.S.C.'s Pacific
Coast Conference supremacy and j
lost, 13-0. Pittsburgh was held to a •
scoreless tie by Ohio State. Rice's j
Owls met Texas University for the
Southwest Conference champion- j
ship, and were defeated 18-6.
Eastern Schedule Lighter
Though the unbeaten and untied .
are more numerous along the At- !
lantic Seaboard, this day may bo
attributed to easier early season
schedules rather to any marked :
gridiron superiority. Harvard and
Colgate are the only Eastern elevens ;
with more than an even chance of .
finishing the season with perfect,
records, but even Harvard must j
still contend with Army's developing
team, and Colgate plays Brown on j
Thanksgiving Day.
Harvard was lucky to beat Dart
mouth 10-7 yesterday, as Yale's un
fortunate eleven was being whipped
by Army 20-0. Colgate defeated ,
New York University 14-0, while,
