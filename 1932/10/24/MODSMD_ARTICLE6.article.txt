# PLANS FOR TEA DRAW TO CLOSE
## Proceeds Will Aid Needy Stanford Students 
### 
Final plans are under way to make
the Chrysanthemum tea given
yearly by the Mothers' Club the
best in years. Mrs. Hoover, who has
long been a member of the club,
has given her home to be used for
the tea on October 27.
All who are interested in the pro
gram of student Welfare which the
club sponsors are cordially invited
to attend the tea. The Mothers' Club
established and maintains the Stan
ford Rest Homes. Proceeds from
this tea will be used for scholar
ships and to aid students in cases
of emergencies. Last year the club
gave over thirty scholarships.
Tickets, which will be $1, will be
sold under the direction of Mrs. A.
M. Cathcart, and can be obtained
from members of the Executive
Board which includes Mesdames F.
H. Fowler, A. E. Roth, H. W. Steb
bins, H. C. Moreno, and E. K.
Strong. Representatives from whom
tickets can be bought have been ap
pointed for each of the peninsula
towns. On the campus, Mrs. Ewell
of the Women's Club House will
have charge of the sale of tickets.
Mrs. John R. Holman, chairman
of the candy committee, has re
quested that all candy be brought to
the Women's Club House before
noon on October 26, so that it can
be properly sorted and boxed be
fore the tea.
Mrs. F. H. Fowler, chairman of
the chrysanthemum committee, has
sent out a plea that every one who
can donate flowers would do so, as
there is difficulty in obtaining
enough.
