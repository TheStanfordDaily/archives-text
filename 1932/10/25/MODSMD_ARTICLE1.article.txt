WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.
Vu., Oct. 24 (/P) â€”Legal beer and a
Federal tax thereon could bring the
Government as much as $754,000,000
additional revenue, the Investment
Bankers' Association convention was
informed by its Federal taxation
committee today.
Without giving an opinion on
prohibition, the committee re
ported that a tax up to 40 cents
a gallon on beer might readily be
levied, which would bring this
large sum, and which is roughly
equivalent to three-fourths of the
Federal income tax collected in
the last fiscal year.
Tax Benefits Cited
"The assistance," the committee
reported, "such additional revenue
would be in the present emergency,
representing as it would a volun
tary payment constituting a burden
only on those who chose to become
subject thereto, cannot Be disre
garded.
"From all the data on the present
estimated consumption of illegal
beer, naturally approximate and
subject to wide variations, a very
substantial portion of this tax reve
nue would not represent additional
expenditure on the part of the
American public, but rather a diver
sion of funds now going into boot
legging channels."
Colonel Ahm M. Pope in his ad
dress opening the convention re
ported results of an association re
search to show that on the whole
bond investors have suffered sur
prisingly little by bond defaults.
Bonds Held Safe
He said although "there have
been the greatest number of bond
defaults in history," he is convinced
figures he has collected nevertheless
"emphasize the comparative safety
of bonds and the care which must
have been exercised by bankers."
The real estate securities commit
tee reported real estate values will
not recover, not only until taxes are
cut, but also until taxing powers of
local and State governments are re
stricted.
