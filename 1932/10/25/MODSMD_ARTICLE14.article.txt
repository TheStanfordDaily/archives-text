### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Eat beef and you'll have numer
ous offspring.
This, in effect, is the conclusion
of Professor James R. Slonaker,
professor emeritus of physiology
and a nationally known diet spe
cialist.
What cheese does for a rat, beef
does for a man, Dr. Slonaker de
duced from a series of experiments
carried on over half a lifetime.
Beefsteak furnishes man the 15 per
cent protein diet which insures the
hardiest life and leaves behind the
largest family.
Dr. Slonaker has been conducting
intensive studies of longevity by
means of rats. The rat, being most
like the human being, or vice versa,
in its physiologic responses, the pro
fessor set about finding what was

1 best for people by determining
! what was best for rats. When he
j came to proteins he began to make
| history.
i Adults who ate "reasonable quan
tities of mixed diet" of plain whole
' some food, got the most out of life,
: lived the longest, healthiest, and
! best, he found.
j Proteins were the key. A rat
| which got his 15 per cent protein
, diet regularly had the most chil
dren and lived to the ripest age.
! The human problem, the professor
| found, was much the same.
Beefsteak, cheese, and other pro
| tein producing foods really cut a
figure in future race statistics, Dr.
! Slonaker believes, under the theory
i that he who saves the protein saves
| all.
