# E.E. Robinson, Democrat, Will Support G.O.P.
## Citizenship Director Tells; Reasons for Hoover 
### Paul Zulch 
"I'm a Democrat supporting Her
bert Hoover."
Edgar Eugene Robinson, profes
sor of American History and Di
rector of Citizenship, thus an
nounced his stand in the coming
presidential election.
Convalescing at his Stanford cam
pus home from a seven weeks' ill
ness, Dr. Robinson nevertheless is
taking a keen interest in the politi
cal campaign.
Leadership liis Issue
"The outstanding issue of the
present campaign is the question of
leadership," stated Robinson. "In
four of the five qualities which I
consider essential to governmental
leadership, Mr. Hoover excels, in
the fifth he is good.
"Firstly, few men have ever had
such a conception of the machinery
of the Federal Government as Her
bert Hoover. A grasp of the mech
anism of government show through
out his administration and his un
derstanding of political government
was evident before he went to the
presidency.
Forms New Policies
"Secondly, he is superior in his
ability to formulate new national
policies. An excellent example of
this is his proposal for a moratori
um on European war debts.
"Thirdly, Mr. Hoover has had long
previous experience in handling
large affairs.
"Fourthly, he has shown ability
to lead his political party.
Lauds Personality
"Fifthly, a good leader needs a
personality that will reach great
masses of people. In the past few
weeks, Mr. Hoover has shown this
in an increasing degree."
Asked for the usual pre-election
predictions, Dr. Robinson said: "Un
less there is a large stay-at-home
vote, unless Norman Thomas fails
to secure a large protest vote, and
unless the bulk of the progressive
Republican vote goes to the Demo
cratic ticket, Mr. Hoover will win
by a substantial margin."
