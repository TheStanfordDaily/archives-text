### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 24 (TP)â€”One
hundred and two women are run
ning for the Senate, House and va
rious state offices in next month's
general elections and the National
Woman's Party sees two major rea
sons for this record number.
Commenting on a survey by the
Associated Press showing that three
women vying for Senatorial honors,
28 trying for the House, two for
governor, and 69 for less important
state posts, Ruth Taunton, secretary
of the Woman's Party, said one rea
son "Is a natural growth through 12
years of political activity; the other
is growth forced by the efforts of
many to destroy the economic inde
pendence of women in the name of
the depression."
Nine of the 102 women candidates
are seeking re-election.
