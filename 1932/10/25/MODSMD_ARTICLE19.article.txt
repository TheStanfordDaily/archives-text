# Il Duce in War Regalia Urges Industrial Peace
## 
### 
TURIN, Italy, Oct. 24 (/P>â€”Booted
and spurred and wearing the new
army helmet, Premier Mussolini
carried his message of industrial
peace direct to the workers today
when he visited a large automobile
plant here.
He stood beside a huge wooden
anvil, placed in the factory to re
mind the men that II Duce is a
blacksmith's son.
"No other country in Europe or
America does for the worker what
Fascism is doing for you," he told
the assembled factory hands. "From
morning to night I am absorbed in
the task of seeking to create more
employment for the people."
