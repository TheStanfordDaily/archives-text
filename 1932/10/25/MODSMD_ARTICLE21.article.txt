# G.O.P. Leader Predicts Thomas Votes
## 
### 
A large Socialist vote in the Stan
ford straw ballot on the presidential
election is anticipated by Dr. Harry
B. Reynolds, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Palo Alio Re
publican Club.
In an interview late last night he
said, "I believe that in America, as
in Germany, college students have
a tendency to lean toward radical
thought in political matters, differ
ing considerably from their parents'
opinions. Thus we can expect a not
inconsiderable percentage of the
votes in The Stanford Daily's ad
mirable pull to be cast for the So
cialist candidate, Norman Thomas."
"A college poll should serve as a
good cross-section of the nation
wide public opinion, as the college
represents all classes; we hope that
America's youth will show evidence
of constructive thinking."
