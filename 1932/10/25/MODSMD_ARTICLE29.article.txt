# THE 						LAST OUTPOST
## 
### 
Alter receiving a student vole of' approximately sixteen
to one proportions for its continuance last spring, this fall
the Concert Series finds itself well behind the ticket sale
record for the )52 season. Not so far behind as the
B.A.C. perhaps, but still well behind. The Daily would
prefer expending its energies in an attempt to generate a
bit of the cultural attitude <Â»n the campus to urging its
readers to attend each and evcrv football game, although
both might be fillile attempts.
The Concert Series stands (thanks to an intelligent
electorate on that day in May) as the last outpost of culture
on the Farm, excepting, of course, Director I lelvenston's
dramatic productions in the Assembly Hall. This year the
(iraphic Art Division in the School of Education is repre
sented by just one instructor. The Art (iallcry is a mere
shadow of what you can never convince the present under
graduate il once was. The orchestra is not truly a Stanford
organization, and the band .... well, the band plays "Mail,
Alma Mater" in place of the hvmn. Culture? What is left
of it here at Stanford but the Concert Series?
The Concert Series attempts to till the yawning abyss
marked "Culture" on the campus, but its attempt can ac
complish nothing without student support. In the opening
concert tomorrow night the Series managers present Dino
Borgioli, star of the current San Francisco opera season.
Stanford residents who were unable to secure opera tickets
for one reason or another, should recognize and take ad
vantage of the line quality and popular prices of Concert
Series entertainment.
