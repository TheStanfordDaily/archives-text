students put into effect. The Daily was one of the many;
papers throughout the country that protested til the in- [
justice of this ruling.
The full text of the CJiro.tide's editorial follows:
"Secretary of Labor Doak's ruling that foreign students!
in the I'nited States may not work to pay part of their way!
through college is apparently to be somewhat modified.'
The case of each student charged with the heinous offense j
will he considered separately and on its decisions.
"From the discussions that have followed promulgation!
of Mr. Doak's original order il develops that the Department
i»f Labor never intended its ruling to be so sweeping as to
send home those bona tide foreign students who because;
of reduced allowances find il necessary to engage in part
lime employment.
"Rather was the order directed at thousands of refugees'
from Russia and Turkey who have been using the privileges,
accorded foreign students as a means to enter the I'nited :
States. These have no intention of studying. And the em
ployment they obtain keeps jobs from American working!

"A great deal of the criticism aroused bv the original I
order might have been avoided had the Department of
Labor consulted the Office of Kducation of the Interior De
partmeiit. Apparently this was not done."
