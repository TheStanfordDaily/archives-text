The rather embarrassing figures, denoting seholaslie j
standing, that follow every undergraduate's name in thei
Bawlout may be a means of accurately forecasting his or i
her future. According to Dr. Hugh A. Smith, now of the j
t nivcrsilv of Wisconsin, who recently completed a survey
covering some 1800 graduates of that college, the student'
with the high grades in the university was the man who
made good in the world.
1 his statement was further substantiated by a compari
son of two lisls, one of ( .)7 graduates who were considered j
the "most worthy, successful or eminent," and the other list
of students who had attained the highest grades while in I
college, rhe two lisls were found lo contain 87 names ini
common.
Those of us. and there are many, who are inclined to|
sneer at the student and mutter "greasy grind" and other
unlovely epithets behind his hack, would do well to muse on
Ihe results of (his survey. Prominence in campus organiza-j
lions and in college politics should be thought of as second-!
ary in importance to studies. Positions on the dance com
mittee open far fewer doors in the cold, cold world than
the much maligned Phi Bete kcv.
