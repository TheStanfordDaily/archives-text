# BULL SESSION
## STARTLING THREATS NO. 1 
### 
I Thursday: somebody saws some
J hinges. Friday morning: a door
I crashes to destruction in the Dance
Studio. Saturday night: a dance is
given in the Women's Gym. And in
Monday's paper Women's Physical
Education Head Bertha Dyment
! makes a statement. Says Doctor
j Dyment in effect, any further dam
| age to the building in relation to
; student dances may result in the
j students being forbidden to use the
Gym for social affairs.
There are two views that may be
I taken of this threat; and whichever
is taken, finds one groveling in the
1 bogs of fallacity if not actual per
| versity. One is that it means nothing;
but is merely an idle threat tu scare
; off would-be vandals. That is the
, kindest interpretation and the most
i pointless. The way to stop hinge
' hackers is to post watchmen to grab
i all suspicious characters by the col
j lar.
Surely the learned Doctor does
| not suppose that to insure the Gym
; foi A.S.S.U. dances the student body
! will organize snooper committees
| and gym guards to patrol up and
' down and around the Gym—night
i and day—to guarantee the inviola
! bility of brass hinges. Because an
j administrative official scolds, the
i vandals will not stop their nefarious
I work. They know, as everyone
! knows, that dances will be held
' even though some simpletons con
| tinue to perpetrate such acts of
high-school destruction.
But Dr. Dyment's statement is in
\ teresting from another angle. It is
j reasoned that because damage re
: suits from dances in "her" Gym,
! the only thing is to lock up the
; place at night—and let the students
I whistle. Let's continue the logic,
j The B.A.C.'s stadium always suffers
; from football games—not only is the
j turf ruined by the cleats-—but holes
! are burnt in the wcod—gates are

smashed by ruffians—etc. If the
B.A C. became Dymentized, they j
would forbid football games; close j
i the stadium —and conduct an ex- i
periment to see how long the thing j
1 could really last—how few scratches !
1 would mar it, if no one ever shuf
fled through its gates.
But the laboratories suffer in
juries from various accidents. Let's <
seal them up for posterity's archae- j
! ologists. A certain department suf- |
fered last year when someone broke |
a window and a desk in getting I
I some examinations. Let's close up
| the Quad. The Library annually i
1 lo.ses hundreds of books through j
i theft, etc.—Director Van Patten j
| never suggested that he intended 1
locking his heavy oak doors against j
! the students. But if Dr. Dyment is |
right—he should.
In fact, why not move everyone i
i off the campus? Then the Adminis- !
tration could hire guards—arm them {
j with sub-machine guns—and by
' force of lead and arms keep the en
| tire University free from damage.!
■ Never would vandals have a chance (
j to hurt the opulent Gym. No stu- i
I dents would scratch its new paint. I
j It would be kept beautiful and new j
I —a beauty and glory to its rulers)
| forever and ever.
Any use of anything entails wear i
—always usual and sometimes un- j
usual as in the broken doors to the ;
, Gym. The "damage is unfortunate, j
' But to threaten to take away the
: Gym because this happened shows
! a complete lack of understanding of
1 the whole thing. The women's plant !
over by Roble is the logical place
for dances. And will probably re- |
main the scene of campus affairs, j
Fortunately, not all members of the j
Administration feel that dollars— >
and the petty desire to keep the J
place nice and shiningly new—are j
more important than the social life j
of the campus. —Abe Mellinkoff i
