ZWEI MENSCHEN—At the Var- j
sity Theater.
Brilliant acting by Gustav Froeh
lieh made of this an excellent pic
ture, in spite of a stilted story and i
atrocious cutting, together with un- j
even direction. The plot deals with j
a young man forced into the priest- !
hood because of his mother's vow, j
although he is not at all fitted for j
such an office.
The opening scenes, devoted large- j
ly to building up the character of |
the man, and thus skillfully laying I
the basis for the plot, are by far!
the best. They are padded a little, j
in order to produce a slow tempo \
from which to build. If the tempo \
had increased as it should have, the ;
result would have been fine trage- !
dy. But instead the plot drifted into j
comic relief, and completely lost it- ;
self in attempting to show con- i
trasts. The plot was over at least i
twenty minutes before the picture !
ended.
The photography, which aided the j
picture in the beginning, also went
bad, and the last scenes persisted in
cutting oft' the tops of the actors'
heads. Bits of carelessness like this
spoiled an excellent play. There
were many skillful touches in the
direction, and while symbolism was
continually present it never became
too obvious.

| But the endless duplication, out of
| place comedy, and strained con
i trasts dragged the picture out end
lessly. The director lacked taste,
i Froehlich alone is responsible for j
j the great success the picture at
tained; his acting was almost flaw- i
! less, and he built his character in I
j such a way as to make the stiff plot j
j seem plausible. lie almost succeed- j
: ed in making tragedy out of a com- :
i bination of pathos and melodrama, j

PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES (Hal !
Roach-Metro) —At the Stanford
Theatre.
. To maintain a consistently amus- i
i ing flow of mental comedy, clever j
j smart chat, is a difficult task; less!
difficult, but still not easy, is sus- 1
j tenance of physical comedy.
That Laurel and Hardy were j
| able, with competent, assistance from
1 other players, to make this picture :
;as funny as it is, indicates their
i considerable slapstick abilities. Their 1
islyle is, of course, unchanged, and'
the situations from which the com
-1 edy arises, basically alike.
There is sufficient variety, how- !
ever, to entertain, and certain half
hearted attempts to be sentimental i
happily die in their conception. •
A pleasant small child is the chief
support of the comedians. The bed
i time tale scene is the most original *
