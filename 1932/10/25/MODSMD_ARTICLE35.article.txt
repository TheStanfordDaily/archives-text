| NEW YORK, Oct. 24 (/P). —An
| address at Newark, N.J., was added
I definitely today to President Hoo- j
■ ver's speaking itinerary.
Eastern headquarters of the Re- i
publican National Committee an- !
nounced the President would speak
j there, at a site to be selected, the
' afternoon of October 31 on his way ,
to New York. He will deliver a
j speech at Madison Square Garden
I here that night.
j For the first lime in the history of !
; Columbia University members of
j fraternities may serve as dance
J patrons.

j gag in the show, the subtlest, and
' the most consistently amusing,
i The picture cannot free itself
! from slow spots. It was, apparently, ;
! impossible to stretch slapstick from
two to seven reels. But it's a funnier ,
feature than most comedies (to j
single out one, "Speakeasily," with
Keaton and Durante) as it stands.
