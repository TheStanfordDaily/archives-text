Stock averages moved barely !
higher yesterday, closing at 40.15, .
up .45 over Saturday. Fluctuations I
were mild, confined for the most
part to a few stocks. The bond mar- â€¢
ket was weak, especially foreign ,
descriptions.
The American dollar rose on most
foreign exchanges. Special weakness
developed in pound sterling. Grain
prices made new seasonal lows.
Monday's stock exchange sales of
slightly more than half a million !
shares revealed again the almost j
entire absence of interest in the
market on the part of the public, j
In these days when receiverships j
appear near for some of the weaker
companies, bondholders should take I
special care to inspect the personnel
and plans of bonds from holders in i
return for certificates of deposit. Al- |
most always the bonds of companies
in receivership continue to sell !
higher than certificates of deposit j
against these bonds.
Recently there have been in- j
stances of corporations changing
their capital structure from no-parj
to par value stock; this assures some
little protection to stockholders since
a certain corporate equity must be
preserved unless a capital deficit is
to be shown.
Although continued gains have
been shown in steel output, railroad t
traffic and aircraft companies' in
come the speculative element re
fuses to be induced to enter the
market before election uncertainties
are disposed of.
