## VARNER SWITCHES MEN AS STANFORD VORKS FOR U.C.L.A. Cards Hold Long Practice Under Arc Lights; Regulars Rest 
### Albert Guerard 
"Pop" Warner's weekly scrim
age for members of the varsity
iuad who saw no action on the
•evious Saturday was Hold as usual
jsterday afternoon, but. the "Old
jx" refused to waste any time in
•ooming two men for new jobs on
s first- and second-string elevens.
"Red" Targhetta and Stan Ander
m played in Saturday's game, but
icy both competed in last night's
act ice which finished under flood
?hts. Targhetta was shifted from
ght guard to bolster up the left
jard position held down so far by
ed Kite.
Targhetta May Start
This shift, which probably indi
ces that Targhetta will be moved
o to the first eleven before next
iturday's game with U.C.L.A., was
it unexpected because of the steady
lprovement shown by him during
10 seven weeks of fall practice.
Anderson was being sent through
s paces from quarterback position
isterday afternoon, although he
is played fullback a good part of
i.s current campaign. Stan is a good
isser, so Warner felt his talents
ere being wasted at fullback,
ordy Campbell badly outclasses
ly of the older Indian quarter
icks, but Anderson is good reserve
aterial. His extraordinary punting
an asset for any team. The Stan
rd punters, pre-game predictions
>twithstanding, were outkieked
>arly eight yards to "a kick against
e Trojans.
More Quarterbacks Needed
One of the most efficient cogs in
.S.C.'s offensive machine is her
)ility to send fresh quarterbacks
to the game every few minutes,
us keeping the tempo of her ruli
ng attack at even efficiency.
Warner realizes that four good
larterbacks would help Stanford
st as much as the Trojans, so he
ill spend a good part of the next
w weeks in developing Anderson,
jx Walker, and Dusty Allen. The
her quarterback, Campbell, is al
ady about as good as they come.

More Quarterbacks Needed
One of the most efficient cogs in
.S.C.'s offensive machine is her
)ility to send fresh quarterbacks
to the game every few minutes,
us keeping the tempo of her ruli
ng attack at even efficiency.
Warner realizes that four good
larterbacks would help Stanford
st as much as the Trojans, so he
ill spend a good part of the next
w weeks in developing Anderson,
jx Walker, and Dusty Allen. The
her quarterback, Campbell, is al
ady about as good as they come.
