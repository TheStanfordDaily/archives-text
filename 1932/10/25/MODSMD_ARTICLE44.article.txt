SOMEWHAT SHAKEN, Stanford's Indians pickcd themselves out of
j the dust last night and bore down in practice for the second of three :
j consecutive week-ends of Pacific Coast Conference football. The sting
. of that 13-0 upset at the hands of U.S.C. was still with them, but they |
: were inclined to take their beating philosophically and go to work on j
j U.C.L.A. this weekend and University of Washington the following Sat- j
i urday.

The hangover of the annual Trojan-Cardinal gridiron warfare
will appear in person Saturday afternoon in the Stadium when
Coach Winterburn's freshmen tangle with the U.S.C. yearlings.
And Stanford is figured to win.

SECOND THOUGHTS ... It seemed funny to see empty seats in
' the Stadium Saturday . . . rain in San Francisco probably kept a mob !
! away . . . what's Bill Ingram doing at California? . . . his win up at
I Washington Saturday gave the Bears new life . . . and probably definitely
put the skids under Jimmy Phelan . . . the alumni are hard to please >
up there. . . or, are they ...
That was some broadcast the other night . . . Johnny Weis
-11111 Iler, Earle Sande, Babe Didrikson, Gene Sara/en, Babe Ruth,
and Lou Gehrig . . . all oil the same program from different parts
of the nation . . . the idea was a good one . . .and if YOU have a
few spare cents ... or dollars ... it wouldn't be a bad idea to
help your community chest ...
Santa Clara and St. Mary's tangle Sunday in Kezar Stadium,
San Francisco . . . wonder if that will be a sell-out . . . The Gaels
to win . . . although 1 hope the Broncs . . . Clipper Smith is a
great guy ... .„ |
The official statements from both camps after last Saturday's football j
! game here said there were no injuries. That's right—they were all able
To walk and use their arms. But they took a beating, and if you are
doubtful you should have seen the Stanford'men as they walked out of
; the dressing-room.
Here Laborde had a bad limp. He played on a leg that had grown
soft because he hasdn't used it for two weeks while he was on crutches,
i Gordy Campbell had a peach of a shiner. So did several others. Orv
Mohler, the chief thunder (according to reports) of the Thundering Herd,
was bashed in the head, poor boy, and had to have it X-rayed. He was ,
okeh Everybody that played was impi^essed—either by cleats or straight- j
