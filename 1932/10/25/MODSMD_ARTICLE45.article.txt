# Gray Gridders Battle Varsity on Even Terms
## 
### 
With a turnout of more than four
full teams the Stanford Grays yes- j
terday opened their fourth week of
practice in a scrimmage against a
I team picked from the varsity squad.
: The team coached by Murray Cud
deback and Ernie Nevers succeeded
i in holding their more experienced
I colleagues almost gainless and set
them back for losses a number of
| times.
Efforts have been made to secure
j a game for the Grays this Saturday i
! but nothing definite has been lined
up as yet. Conference rules allow
i the reserve squad only one other
J game beside the one with Califor
nia, which will probably be held j
' early in November.
The Grays will be allowed to take
part in several scrimmages with
i outside teams before their season j
: ends but can only play two regular i
j games. They have already met I
Menlo and San Jose State in scrim- 1
I mages, in both of which ihe Indians
held a decided edge.
