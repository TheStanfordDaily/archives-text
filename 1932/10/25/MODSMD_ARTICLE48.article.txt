## Team Groomed for Second Clash Saturday 
### 
Shades of gloom mixed with a
! streak of determination and fight in
; the varsity soccer ranks yesterday
!as Coach Harry Maloney began
; preparations for the second game of
: the season against San Jose State
1 this Saturday.
Commenting on Stanford's defeat
Iby San Francisco University last
j Saturday, Maloney gpve full credit
to the excellent teamwork of the
Don forwards and said that it was
j in direct contrast to the looseness
! and lack of co-operation which was
| evident among the Stanford for-
I wards.
I After sending the forwards
through the halfbacks and fullbacks
j in an effort to establish some kind
jof scoring combination yesterday,
I Maloney tried the varsity out
I against the freshmen in a close
I scrimmage, but. the varsity won out,
3-2.
