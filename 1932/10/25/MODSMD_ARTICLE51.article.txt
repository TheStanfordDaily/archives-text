j ernoon in one of a series of intra
mural touch football games. Zeta .
i Psi broke loose in the last seconds
of play and won a 6-0 victory from
j the El Capitan squad, while the
Dekes eked out a 7-0 win from the 1
Phi Sigs.
: Ernie Arbuckle of A.T.O. stole the j
j show in the triumph over Delta Chi. j
; The versatile backfield man began |
j his scoring rampage with the open- j
ing kick-off which he ran back for
: a touchdown. Ray Forsythe of |
j A.T.O. came into action, ran 65 i
' yards, and tallied the second six j
points. Goss later intercepted a Del- \
ta Chi pass and spurted 45 yards |
to the third score.
With only three seconds to play '
Tom Sales of Zeta Psi heaved a pass ;
to Hank Kuechler who took the ball
for 12 yards and a touchdown and
won the game for the Zetes against '
Et Capitan. A 38-yard pass brought
the Zetes down to their scoring po- '
! tition. George Stump played a fine, j
steady game for El Capitan.
After moving down to the oppo- j
, nent's 20-yard line in the first hall
' of the Deke-Phi Sig game, A1 Guit- !
tard of the Dekes on a lateral from j
i Harry Eichelberger skirted the side- i
lines and scored the lone touch- j
I down of the game. The Dekes dis- '
played perhaps the strongest intra- '
mural line to be placed on the field ;
this season.
