# Frosh Prepare For Trobabes
## Grayson, Reisner Expected To Be Ready 
### 
With his two ailing left halfbacks
; improving daily, Coach Chuck Win
\ terburn is preparing his frosh grid
) men for the second of their three
big games. Winterburn has been
preparing his team for the contest
—with the U.S.C. yearlings Satur
day in the Stanford Stadium —ever
I since the season began.
Bob Grayson, who was banged
j up in an auto accident, will be ready
!to start Saturday. He was not
J needed last week, and the rest
| should improve his effectiveness
■ against the Trojans. Reisner, on
j crutches over the week-end due to
a twisted ankle sustained against
, Menlo J.C., discarded his walking
| sticks yesterday and also should be
< able to play.
The Trobabes showed much im
-1 provement when they beat Califor
i nia Saturday, and, although Stan
ford is favored, the game will be
I far from a pushover.
