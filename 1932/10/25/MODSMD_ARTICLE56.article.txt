# HARVARD GRIDDERS LIKELY TO COP EASTERN HONORS
## 
### 
For the first time in several [
' years, Harvard University finds her
self in an excellent position to grab
off the eastern intercollegiate title,
! and the distinction of an unbeaten
j and untied record.
The road laid out for Eddie Ca-
{ styjs eleven is far from smooth.
Hofy Cross and Brown, both still
1 undefeated, will be pointing for
: Harvard; Army's Mule has proved
its toughness by trampling Yale,
nnd however disastrous the rest of
Old Eli's season record may be, Yale
: is always a tough opponent for Har
j vard.
j Harvard scored 106 points in her
! first two games against Buffalo and

' New Hampshire, swamped Perm
i State 4ti-13, and last Saturday eked
out a 10-7 victory over Dartmouth.
Casey's line is uneven —strong at
Captain Carl Hageman's end, but
weak on the other flank where Naz
ro is the first string wingman.
Tackles Hardy and Bancroft are
good, Easterly and Crane are less
proficient at the crucial guard po
sitions. Hallowed, center, is a good
player on offense.
Quarterback Wells is a polished
player, but does not compare with
halfback Jack Crickard, a crack
triple-threater. Nevin, the other
halfback, and Dean, fullback, are
better than average.
