# YODELLING CHIMNEY-SWEEPING CHAMP VISITS FARM AFTER FOUR-YEAR ABSENCE
## 
### 
This is an especially filthy story, 1
butâ€”
I
John, the self-styled "intercol- |
legiate yodelling and chimney- j
sweeping champion," paid another ;
visit to the campus yesterday after |
a four-year absence. His lithe flue- |
fitting figure and odd orange hat are |
a familiar sight to hundreds of col- !
lege students on dozens of campi
throughout ihe country where he is j
known formally as John F. Lenney.
Sweeper John caters exclusively j
to college people in his unique call- S
ling, yodelling from chimney-tops j
the tunes of fraternity and class'
songs of the particular campus he t
may be de-sooting. He claims he's!
never been stuck inside a chimney 1
for more than four hours at a time. ;
but he seems somewhat fearful of
being trapped for a long period I
some day because of the stoutness
that comes with middle age. So j
now John never descends into the |
sooty depths of campus chimneys ;
without his trusty assistant on guard j

above. Francis L. ("Tex") Patterson
has worked with John ever since he
rescued Lenney from atop a tall
factory smokestack in Vancouver,
Washington. The union was brought
about a year ago when John, an in
veterate cigar smoker, carelessly
burned a rope that was his only
means of descent from the stack.
Tex was the first to reach him.
That John fits well into campus
life as well as campus chimneys is
evidenced by dozens of letters from
appreciative fraternity and sorority
houses that he has rid of surplus
soot. He boasts of being pledged
as an honorary m amber some years
tigo (for twenty years he has
chimney-swept and yodelled) to a
Greek house at a Middle Western
college.
A present John and his partner
Tex are sweeping through Palo Alto
and the campus; when the soot is all
gone they will hie south or back
east again in quest of dirtier, darker
chimneys than this locality may
have to offer.
