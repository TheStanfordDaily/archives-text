heart of gold beneath the rough exterior.
But in these days of increasing competition, your social progress al
most requires that you wear Campus Cords.
These distinctive light-colored Cords merit a popular place in your
wardrobe. They are correct in shade and in every style detail. Their
hip-fit and straight hang "click" with university men from Maine to
California.
Campus Cords are always seen, but never "heard". They wear like a
silver dollar, and keep their style-lines through countless cleanings or
washings.
