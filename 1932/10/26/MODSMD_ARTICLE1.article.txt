# BORGIOLI OPENS FARM CONCERT SERIES TONIGHT
## A.S.S.U. Presents Program By Italian Tenor in Pavilion at 8:20 STARS IN S. F. OPERA Features 14 Varied Songs In Local Concert 
### 
Presenting a varied program of
14 songs and arias, Dino Borgioli,
Italy's favorite tenor, acclaimed for
his outstanding successes in grand
opera in San Francisco during the
last month, will open the Associated
Students Concert Series tonight at
8:20 o'clock in the Stanford Pavil
ion. He will be accompanied at the
piano by Raymond McFeeters.
A man of great personal charm
and strength, still showing evidence
in his figure of military training
during the World War, Borgioli is
the possessor of a voice of rare
timbre and extended range. Al
though he takes his career very se
riously, criticizing the lax habits of
what he calls "improvisation," he
still finds time to compose songs and
poetry and has also tried his hand
at water color work.
"Tenor of Kings"
Known as the "tenor of kings"
because of his frequent appearance
before royalty, Borgioli, a Tuscan
by birth, studied with Giacchetti in
Florence and made his debut at the
Theatre Dal Verme in Milan. Since
his initial Italian successes he has
achieved a world-wide reputation in
lyric tenor roles in most of the great
opera houses of both Europe and
America. He was chosen by Melba
six years ago to be her tenor on her
farewell tour of Australia.
Borgioli first came to the United
States two years ago for a Califor
nia tour and has been very popular
on the Pacific Coast for the last two
seasons. Following his concert here
and one in Santa Barbara in No
vember, the only two appearances
he will make on the coast this sea
son outside the San Francisco Opera
Company, he will leave for the East
to appear in concert recitals.
