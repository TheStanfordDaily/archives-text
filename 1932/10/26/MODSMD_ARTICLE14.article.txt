# 'Of Thee I Sing' Reading Planned By Drama Group
## 
### James Sandoe 
"Of Thee I Sing," the New York i
, musical comedy smash, now enter
| ing its 45th week on Broadway, j
| will be the first Sword and Sandals
reading of the fall quarter. The per
j sonal permission of George S. Kauf- j
\ man, one of several collaborators,
I for the reading has been received;
i and selection of persons for the
| various parts will proceed at once, j
Because of the size of the cast it
has been found expedient to hold
j general tryouts. Anyone interested
in reading a part is invited to come
to the Little Theatre this afternoon
j at 4:15 o'clock. Eighteen roles, most
' of which are satiric portraits of poli-
I ticians of various sorts, are to be
■ filled.
When the travesty opened in New ,
York, the critics threw aside all re
i straint and poured a Mood of com
-11

i mendatory adjectives upon the au- i
i thors, George Kaufman and Morris j
! Kyskind, who wrote the libietto, and ;
George and Ira Gershwin who con- j
. tributed the score. Since that time I
the public has reported in the same
! manner, as capacity houses for the
j long run indicate.
The reading is to be conducted in
i the same manner as were the pre
' vious Sword and Sandals programs, '
! which found considerable favor on
i the campus during ihe spring and
; summer quarters. It will be open,
1 to the public without charge as has j
been the custom.
Tryoutees are urged to appear to
, day although there will be other
1 tryouts, because it is desired to be
| gin reading rehearsals as soon after
the Dramatic Council production of
"'Death Takes a Holiday" as possible. 1
