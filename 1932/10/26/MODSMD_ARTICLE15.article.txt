# CURTAIN RISES ON FANTASTIC DRAMA FRIDAY
## Ticket Sale Continues; Lee Chapin Cast in Role of Legionnaire 
### 
With a number of good seats still
remaining at the new reduced prices,
the ticket sale for "Death Takes A
Holiday" will continue today at the
Old Union and at David Keeble's
in Palo Alto. Reservations are
priced at one dollar, seventy-five
cents, and fifty cents.
"Death Takes A Holiday" will be
presented on October 28 at 8:30 in
Assembly Hall, a peculiarly time
ly date, inasmuch as the three-day
holiday of Death is taken at this
same time of year. These three days
are in themselves suggestive of the
entire fantastic tone of the play,
which covers Hallowe'en, All Saints'
Day, and All Souls' Day.
Exotic Story
"An exotic tale . . . which travels
an unfamiliar land and touches the
imagination royally": this is the cri
tical opinion of Brooks Atkinson in
the New York Times of this play
which was one of the sensations of
the 1929-1930 season, when it played
at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre
with Philip Merivale and Rose Ho
bart in the leading roles.
The play was translated by Walter
Ferris from the original Italian of
Alberto Casella, who, interestingly
enough, is known as a man fre
quently on speaking terms with
death. When young, he turned from
the study of law tu become a news
paper man (a hazardous occupation,
to be sure), and he is also a duel
ist, an automobile speed demon, a
provocative orator, and winner of
the Croce d'Onore for valor in the
great war.
Filled With Emotion
The distinction of "Death Takes A
Holiday" lies not only in its use
of the macabre, but in 'its skillful
combination of the most delicate
ideas and emotions. "It is a fantasy
through which always runs the elec
tric current of emotion," according
to Lockridge of the New York Times.
Announcement was made last
night by Harold Helvenston, direc
tor, of the assignment of Lee Chapin
to the role of Major Whitread.
Chapin is well-known on the cam
pus, where in addition to being a
member of the law school, he is at
present acting as head debate
coach. The part of the Major re
quires considerable skill in the in
terpretation of a gallant member
of the French Foreign Legion who,
on meeting Death in his mortal's
guise, looks on him as an interest
ing man whom he has almost met
many times, and whom he would
like to know better.

pus, where in addition to being a
member of the law school, he is at
present acting as head debate
coach. The part of the Major re
quires considerable skill in the in
terpretation of a gallant member
of the French Foreign Legion who,
on meeting Death in his mortal's
guise, looks on him as an interest
ing man whom he has almost met
many times, and whom he would
like to know better.
With a number of good seats still
remaining at the new reduced prices,
the ticket sale for "Death Takes A
Holiday" will continue today at the
Old Union and at David Keeble's
in Palo Alto. Reservations are
priced at one dollar, seventy-five
cents, and fifty cents.
"Death Takes A Holiday" will be
presented on October 28 at 8:30 in
Assembly Hall, a peculiarly time
ly date, inasmuch as the three-day
holiday of Death is taken at this
same time of year. These three days
are in themselves suggestive of the
entire fantastic tone of the play,
which covers Hallowe'en, All Saints'
Day, and All Souls' Day.
Exotic Story
"An exotic tale . . . which travels
an unfamiliar land and touches the
imagination royally": this is the cri
tical opinion of Brooks Atkinson in
the New York Times of this play
which was one of the sensations of
the 1929-1930 season, when it played
at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre
with Philip Merivale and Rose Ho
bart in the leading roles.
The play was translated by Walter
Ferris from the original Italian of
Alberto Casella, who, interestingly
enough, is known as a man fre
quently on speaking terms with
death. When young, he turned from
the study of law tu become a news
paper man (a hazardous occupation,
to be sure), and he is also a duel
ist, an automobile speed demon, a
provocative orator, and winner of
the Croce d'Onore for valor in the
great war.
Filled With Emotion
The distinction of "Death Takes A
Holiday" lies not only in its use
of the macabre, but in 'its skillful
combination of the most delicate
ideas and emotions. "It is a fantasy
through which always runs the elec
tric current of emotion," according
to Lockridge of the New York Times.
Announcement was made last
night by Harold Helvenston, direc
tor, of the assignment of Lee Chapin
to the role of Major Whitread.
Chapin is well-known on the cam
pus, where in addition to being a
member of the law school, he is at

coach. The part of the Major re
