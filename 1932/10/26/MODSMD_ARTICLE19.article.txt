## Roosevelt Friend Declines To Influence Voters 
### David Mellinkoff 
"There isn't 'a chicken in every
pot'
Nor 'automobiles for all'
Hut this old mule is hitched
outside
And he'll carry us thru' this
fall."
So speaks the Democratic Donkey j
lodged on the office wall of Captain ]
Victor H. Harding, instructor in cit
izenship.
Declining to take an active part j
in influencing campus voters, Cap- ;
tain Harding stated:
Knows Roosevelt
"Probably my association and
friendship with Franklin D. Roose- i
velt make my estimate of him too !
prejudiced in his favor to even pre- i
tend to make an impartial political
statement." Harding has known the
Democratic presidential candidate
since the latter's term as New York
State Senator back in 1909.
But while refusing to make any
arbitrary statement, Harding pre
sented his analysis of the tide of
political sentiment.
"The Democrats are united as
they never have been since the
World War. Also the Republican
party is completely disorganized.
Generally, throughout the country,;
the independents and progressives!
are united with the Democrats. This
is exemplified in California, where
Senator Hiram Johnson, who re- ;
received a 350.000 larger plurality
in 1923 than did Mr. Hoover, is vig
orously supporting Roosevelt.
Large Thomas Vote
"Norman Thomas will undoubt
edly and rightly receive a very flat
tering vote, but the Literary Digest
analysis shows that Thomas is
drawing twice as heavily from the
Republicans as from ihe Democrats."
Harding is inclined to believe in
the present Literary Digest poll be
cause its results have been correct
in both the '24 and '28 elections. At '
present the poll shows Roosevelt 1
ahead by more than 400,000 votes j
out of 2,000,000 votes counted.
