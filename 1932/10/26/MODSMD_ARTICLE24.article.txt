By ROLPH MALLOCH

More straw votes for President of the United States than real votes
for president of the Student Bod> —this was the situation after only one
day of balloting in The Daily's poll of student opinion on the coming
Presidential election.

Enthusiasm unprecedented in recent Stanford election history greeted
the ballot-takers all day yesterday, lines of voters waiting near the Law
steps during most of the day. A check of the directory last night revealed.

• however, that there are still several
'hundred students, both graduate
and undergraduate, who have not
availed themselves of their privilege
to cast a ballot.
Polls Open Today
I The polls will be open today for
\ the last lime, and the deadline is
11 definitely set at 2 o'clock. The re
sults will be tabulated this afternoon
and telegraphed throughout the
country.
Voting will begin today shortly
j before 8 o'clock, and will continue
through the lunch hour. Ballots may
be torn from page 6 of this issue, or
secured at the voting place near the
| Law Steps. The voter's name must
be crossed oil in the student di
rectory before his vote is placed in
the ballot box.
Representatives of each political
i party represented on the campus
are asked to appear at the ballot
i counting, to begin in the Press build
ing at 1 o'clock.
Plan Meetings
Campus political parties have
been busy for the past several weeks
registering adherents, and are plan
ning various mass meetings. Bob
! Gros, Stanford Democratic chair
| man, said last night, ''I want to com
ment on (he excellent sportsmanship
■ and fair play shown by Wayne Ban
-1 nister, Republican manager."
Gros also said, "Democrats are
scrappers, and scrappers concede
nothing to the opposition. However,
to prognosticate an overwhelming
Roosevelt landslide on Mr. Hoover's
own campus would be absurd. Our
fight in such a Republican strong
hold has been an uphill one, replete
with obstacles. We can but hope
that every loyal Democratic sup
porter will go to the polls and reg
| ister his vote for Franklin D. Roose
velt—the man who, regardless of
the outcome of this poll, is destined
to be the next President of the
United States."
A blank line on the ballot pro
j vides space for the writing-in of
any -minor party candidate. Grad
uate students may participate in the
poll and the grad tabulations will be
printed in The Daily. The under
graduate totals will be telegraphed
to the editors of 34 college newspa
pers.
