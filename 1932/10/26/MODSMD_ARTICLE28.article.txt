# GLUTZ, BURPAND THE RALLY COMMITTEE
## 
### 
The 1 )aily lias no desire lo add to the heap of maledic
tions already piled on the heads of the men who direct
Stanford's rooting lliis year. Campus comment has pointed
out only too clearly that the job so far has been poorly
done.
What it does desire lo do, however, is to reiterate a
statement it has made before that the system under which
yell leaders aud Rally Committeemen are chosen should be
reorganized. Those responsible people have fjone on, year
after year, making more and more "hutches," each more
deplorable than the last, and nothing lias been done about
it.

This year's leaders, although they have had little lime in
which to practice for good boners, have succeeded remark
ably well in maintaining that most unenviable reputation.
Their latest "boot," and undoubtedly the most lamentable
of all, occurred last Saturday. After the game, and after the
t'.S.C. rooters had paraded jubilantly in front of the sileul
Stanford stands, the yell leader called for "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," the beloved hymn which has echoed through the twi
light at the close of every major football contest the Cards
have played since the school began.

Hill the band lender apparently does not know just what
llie Stanford hymn is. lie started his outfit playing "Alma
Mater," an entirely different and less significant song. Now,
Ihe yell leader knew that was wrong, and he should have
known also that the hymn always is sung without any sort
of accompaniment. Hut lie didn't say a word or do a thing,
and neither did any member of the rally committee. The
student body went ahead and sang "Alma Mater" and the
old-timers to whom the singing of the hymn is a sacred
thing fell their hearts tear at the sacrilege.
One error on the part of the Hallv Committee might be
excused, but there have been many. The women were to
sit in a special section. They ended up all over the west
side of the stadium. There was to be a tine jollv-up after the
I.S.C. rally. When everything was set they found out there
is a t T niversitv ruling against mid-week dances after 8
o'clock. Last year there was to lie a welcome home rally
for the team after the Dartmouth game. Three members
of the team showed up. And there was the horse rally . . . .
One black mark against the yell leader might be lived
down, but there are more. A man who cannot by the
strength of his personality lire up a crowd which might
otherwise sink into apathetic gloom is not the man for the
job, regardless of how fine or pleasant he is. And a Rally
Committeeman who cannot keep organized well enough to
steer clear of such inexcusable blunders who cannot make
lite student body like what he does, instead of criticizing
and ridiculing obviously is, also, a poor choice.
The 1 )aii.v's points are these : (1) The yell leaders should
be chosen immediately after the football season, when the
student body can have some idea what it is doing, and (2)
at least a nucleus of a Rally Committee should be selected
the year before. As it is now the yell leader is elected in
spring quarter, and the whole affair is a breeding ground
for politics, crooked or no, simply because nobody remem
bers whether .Joe Clutz or Hank Rurp had more lire, or
whether either of them was worth anything in front of a
rooting section.
Assistant veil leaders are chosen on the basis of tryouts
in the basketball pavilion, perhaps the poorest place in the
world to test a man's ability to handle a football crowd.
And the two w ho are picked appear, almost total strangers,
at the first football game before probably the largest crowd
they ever faced. How much better to have the tryouts now
and Ihe election right after the Rig Came, with a little fiery
competition for Ihe jobs.
The, students who do the electing in the spring have the
whole thing thrown in their faces at a time when thoughts
of football and crowded stands and fighting beef and brawn
on the turf seem far away. No wonder it is hard to choose
the right man.
The Kx Committee has only to act properly and the
problem will be solved, with the election in fall quarter
where it belongs. Then next fall the rally committee and
Ihe yell leaders will not have to dabble around for weeks,
getting acquainted with their jobs.
There's no use to criticize any more this fall. The best
Ihing to do now is to work toward a much improved rooting
section at Rerkelev on Rig Came day not an impossible,
goal, bv anv means.

Hill the band lender apparently does not know just what
llie Stanford hymn is. lie started his outfit playing "Alma
Mater," an entirely different and less significant song. Now,
Ihe yell leader knew that was wrong, and he should have
known also that the hymn always is sung without any sort
of accompaniment. Hut lie didn't say a word or do a thing,
and neither did any member of the rally committee. The
student body went ahead and sang "Alma Mater" and the
old-timers to whom the singing of the hymn is a sacred
thing fell their hearts tear at the sacrilege.
One error on the part of the Hallv Committee might be
excused, but there have been many. The women were to
sit in a special section. They ended up all over the west
side of the stadium. There was to be a tine jollv-up after the
I.S.C. rally. When everything was set they found out there
is a t T niversitv ruling against mid-week dances after 8
o'clock. Last year there was to lie a welcome home rally
for the team after the Dartmouth game. Three members
of the team showed up. And there was the horse rally . . . .
One black mark against the yell leader might be lived
down, but there are more. A man who cannot by the
strength of his personality lire up a crowd which might
otherwise sink into apathetic gloom is not the man for the
job, regardless of how fine or pleasant he is. And a Rally
Committeeman who cannot keep organized well enough to
steer clear of such inexcusable blunders who cannot make
lite student body like what he does, instead of criticizing
and ridiculing obviously is, also, a poor choice.
The 1 )aii.v's points are these : (1) The yell leaders should
be chosen immediately after the football season, when the
student body can have some idea what it is doing, and (2)
at least a nucleus of a Rally Committee should be selected
the year before. As it is now the yell leader is elected in
spring quarter, and the whole affair is a breeding ground
for politics, crooked or no, simply because nobody remem
bers whether .Joe Clutz or Hank Rurp had more lire, or
whether either of them was worth anything in front of a
rooting section.
Assistant veil leaders are chosen on the basis of tryouts
in the basketball pavilion, perhaps the poorest place in the
world to test a man's ability to handle a football crowd.
And the two w ho are picked appear, almost total strangers,
at the first football game before probably the largest crowd
they ever faced. How much better to have the tryouts now
and Ihe election right after the Rig Came, with a little fiery
competition for Ihe jobs.
The, students who do the electing in the spring have the
whole thing thrown in their faces at a time when thoughts
of football and crowded stands and fighting beef and brawn
on the turf seem far away. No wonder it is hard to choose
the right man.
The Kx Committee has only to act properly and the
problem will be solved, with the election in fall quarter
where it belongs. Then next fall the rally committee and
Ihe yell leaders will not have to dabble around for weeks,
getting acquainted with their jobs.
There's no use to criticize any more this fall. The best
Ihing to do now is to work toward a much improved rooting
section at Rerkelev on Rig Came day not an impossible,
goal, bv anv means.

Stanford's rooting lliis year. Campus comment has pointed
out only too clearly that the job so far has been poorly
done.
What it does desire lo do, however, is to reiterate a
statement it has made before that the system under which
yell leaders aud Rally Committeemen are chosen should be
reorganized. Those responsible people have fjone on, year

deplorable than the last, and nothing lias been done about
it.

This year's leaders, although they have had little lime in
which to practice for good boners, have succeeded remark
ably well in maintaining that most unenviable reputation.
Their latest "boot," and undoubtedly the most lamentable
of all, occurred last Saturday. After the game, and after the
t'.S.C. rooters had paraded jubilantly in front of the sileul
Stanford stands, the yell leader called for "Hail, Stanford,

One black mark against the yell leader might be lived
down, but there are more. A man who cannot by the
strength of his personality lire up a crowd which might
otherwise sink into apathetic gloom is not the man for the
job, regardless of how fine or pleasant he is. And a Rally
Committeeman who cannot keep organized well enough to
steer clear of such inexcusable blunders who cannot make
lite student body like what he does, instead of criticizing
and ridiculing obviously is, also, a poor choice.
The 1 )aii.v's points are these : (1) The yell leaders should
be chosen immediately after the football season, when the
student body can have some idea what it is doing, and (2)
at least a nucleus of a Rally Committee should be selected
the year before. As it is now the yell leader is elected in
spring quarter, and the whole affair is a breeding ground
for politics, crooked or no, simply because nobody remem
bers whether .Joe Clutz or Hank Rurp had more lire, or
whether either of them was worth anything in front of a
rooting section.
Assistant veil leaders are chosen on the basis of tryouts
in the basketball pavilion, perhaps the poorest place in the
world to test a man's ability to handle a football crowd.
And the two w ho are picked appear, almost total strangers,
at the first football game before probably the largest crowd
they ever faced. How much better to have the tryouts now
and Ihe election right after the Rig Came, with a little fiery
competition for Ihe jobs.
The, students who do the electing in the spring have the
whole thing thrown in their faces at a time when thoughts
of football and crowded stands and fighting beef and brawn
on the turf seem far away. No wonder it is hard to choose
the right man.
The Kx Committee has only to act properly and the
problem will be solved, with the election in fall quarter
where it belongs. Then next fall the rally committee and
Ihe yell leaders will not have to dabble around for weeks,
getting acquainted with their jobs.
There's no use to criticize any more this fall. The best
Ihing to do now is to work toward a much improved rooting
section at Rerkelev on Rig Came day not an impossible,
goal, bv anv means.
The 1 )aily lias no desire lo add to the heap of maledic
tions already piled on the heads of the men who direct
Stanford's rooting lliis year. Campus comment has pointed
out only too clearly that the job so far has been poorly
done.
What it does desire lo do, however, is to reiterate a
statement it has made before that the system under which
yell leaders aud Rally Committeemen are chosen should be
reorganized. Those responsible people have fjone on, year
after year, making more and more "hutches," each more
deplorable than the last, and nothing lias been done about
it.

This year's leaders, although they have had little lime in
which to practice for good boners, have succeeded remark
ably well in maintaining that most unenviable reputation.
Their latest "boot," and undoubtedly the most lamentable
of all, occurred last Saturday. After the game, and after the
t'.S.C. rooters had paraded jubilantly in front of the sileul
Stanford stands, the yell leader called for "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," the beloved hymn which has echoed through the twi
light at the close of every major football contest the Cards
have played since the school began.

Hill the band lender apparently does not know just what
llie Stanford hymn is. lie started his outfit playing "Alma
Mater," an entirely different and less significant song. Now,
Ihe yell leader knew that was wrong, and he should have
known also that the hymn always is sung without any sort
of accompaniment. Hut lie didn't say a word or do a thing,
and neither did any member of the rally committee. The
student body went ahead and sang "Alma Mater" and the
old-timers to whom the singing of the hymn is a sacred
thing fell their hearts tear at the sacrilege.
One error on the part of the Hallv Committee might be
excused, but there have been many. The women were to
sit in a special section. They ended up all over the west
side of the stadium. There was to be a tine jollv-up after the
I.S.C. rally. When everything was set they found out there
is a t T niversitv ruling against mid-week dances after 8
o'clock. Last year there was to lie a welcome home rally
for the team after the Dartmouth game. Three members
of the team showed up. And there was the horse rally . . . .
One black mark against the yell leader might be lived
down, but there are more. A man who cannot by the
strength of his personality lire up a crowd which might
otherwise sink into apathetic gloom is not the man for the
job, regardless of how fine or pleasant he is. And a Rally
