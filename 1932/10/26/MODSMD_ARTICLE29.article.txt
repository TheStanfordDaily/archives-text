# BULL SESSION
## LEADERS IN THE ROUGH 
### 
In Russia, whenever anything is
bad, they burn it. Here, whenever
anything is admittedly unsuccessful,
we educate it—and hope for better
results in the future. Thus every
one about believes that democracy
has hit an all-time "low" in the gov
ernmental market; but still there is
an optimistic feeling about that an
educated electorate will somehow
cure the situation.
Exactly how and why college
graduates will be better citizens is
not exactly known. Yet, it is never
theless hoped that when the nation's
dresser drawers become cluttered
with sheep-skins, the caliber of our
government will increase. Univer
sity students in their own self-gov
ernment have not shown such abili
ty, interest, and honesty as would I
lead one to hope for great changes
when they finally become the na
tion's back-seat drivers.
And when it comes to applying
the memorized class-room theories
to national politics, the great void is
appalling. It is pitifully sad—and
yet hilariously funny that students
can seriously write in their Blue
Books, "Citizens must be well-in
formed in a democracy or else the
corrupt bosses will undermine the
government"—and yet never open a
newspaper to find out that the "arms
conference" is not a parley to lay
down the rule? for spring spooning.
A mighty national campaign is go
ing on 'round about us. No one ex
pects students to get as excited as
postmasters who want to keep their
jobs or would-like-to-be postmas
ters who hope to have their desires
come true in November. But the

| student-body can partake in two
I splendid projects that strike the
| campus this week.
The Stanford Daily, in co-opera
i tion with 34 other universities, is
conducting a national poll on the
presidential election. All students—
undergraduates, graduates, and even
frosh—can vote. The poll closes to
| day at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
j The results should be representa
tive of the campus; and they will if
the student-body can disengage it
self from the collegiate apathy long
enough to make an "X*. Those that
have no opinions on the candidates
at this date—should blush deeply,
struggle severely, and by some Her
culean effort manage to produce a
choice of one kind or the other. It's
good experience if nothing else.
The other political bee that
| stings the campus this week is the
I Political Forum to be held in that
seventh wonder of splendor and
luxury, "The Stanford Little Thea
tre." With short speeches, and the
speakers obligated to answer stump
ing questions from the floor, a large
crowd is expected. That expectation
should not turn out to be the illu
sory hope of individuals who still
believe in Stanford's political soul,
i
Hoover, Roosevelt, Thomas and
Foster will be represented—and a
merry tussle can be expected tomor
row night at 7:30 o'clock. The fight
between the "Great Engineer," the
"Great Governor" and the "Great
Teacher" is on. If the right slant is
manufactured by each student —it's
almost as much fun as a mud-fight
or at least a tie-up.

luxury, "The Stanford Little Thea
tre." With short speeches, and the
speakers obligated to answer stump
ing questions from the floor, a large
crowd is expected. That expectation
should not turn out to be the illu
sory hope of individuals who still
believe in Stanford's political soul,
i
Hoover, Roosevelt, Thomas and
Foster will be represented—and a
merry tussle can be expected tomor
row night at 7:30 o'clock. The fight
between the "Great Engineer," the
"Great Governor" and the "Great
Teacher" is on. If the right slant is
manufactured by each student —it's
almost as much fun as a mud-fight
or at least a tie-up.

In Russia, whenever anything is
bad, they burn it. Here, whenever
anything is admittedly unsuccessful,
we educate it—and hope for better
results in the future. Thus every
one about believes that democracy
has hit an all-time "low" in the gov
ernmental market; but still there is
an optimistic feeling about that an
educated electorate will somehow
cure the situation.
Exactly how and why college
graduates will be better citizens is
not exactly known. Yet, it is never
theless hoped that when the nation's
dresser drawers become cluttered
with sheep-skins, the caliber of our
government will increase. Univer
sity students in their own self-gov
ernment have not shown such abili
ty, interest, and honesty as would I
lead one to hope for great changes
when they finally become the na
tion's back-seat drivers.
And when it comes to applying
the memorized class-room theories
to national politics, the great void is
appalling. It is pitifully sad—and
yet hilariously funny that students
can seriously write in their Blue
Books, "Citizens must be well-in
formed in a democracy or else the
corrupt bosses will undermine the
government"—and yet never open a
newspaper to find out that the "arms
conference" is not a parley to lay
down the rule? for spring spooning.
A mighty national campaign is go
ing on 'round about us. No one ex
pects students to get as excited as
postmasters who want to keep their
jobs or would-like-to-be postmas
ters who hope to have their desires
come true in November. But the

| student-body can partake in two
I splendid projects that strike the
| campus this week.
The Stanford Daily, in co-opera
i tion with 34 other universities, is
conducting a national poll on the
presidential election. All students—
undergraduates, graduates, and even
frosh—can vote. The poll closes to
| day at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
j The results should be representa
tive of the campus; and they will if
the student-body can disengage it
self from the collegiate apathy long
enough to make an "X*. Those that
have no opinions on the candidates
at this date—should blush deeply,
struggle severely, and by some Her
culean effort manage to produce a
choice of one kind or the other. It's
good experience if nothing else.
The other political bee that
| stings the campus this week is the
I Political Forum to be held in that
seventh wonder of splendor and
luxury, "The Stanford Little Thea
tre." With short speeches, and the
speakers obligated to answer stump
ing questions from the floor, a large
