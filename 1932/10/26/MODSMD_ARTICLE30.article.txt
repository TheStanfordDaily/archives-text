THE STAGE IS SET. By Lee Si
monson. Ha r court Brace. IM2.
(At the Stanford Bookstore).
With a prefatory statement which
admits "no pretense to original re
search" and a pleasant restraint as
regards the use of his own work to
illustrate his scenic concepts, Lee
Simonson literally sets the theatrical
world on fire by his clear analysis
of the facts and functions of stage
scenery. He proves the importance
of scenic background from the clas
sic period to the present day and,
at the same time, with a masterly
stroke, flays the designer who be
lieves the theater exists solely for
his own exploitation.

In a brilliant chapter on Edward
Gordon Craig the author makes it
clear that Craig is impractical, a
demi-god still awaiting the arrival
of a god who will be the real the
atrical Messiah. Craig's ability to
act is made manifest by his emo
tional writings. Simonson suggests
what most of us know—that the in
fluence of Craig has -been motivated
by these writings rather than by his
actual productions. However Simon
son may have forgotten that some
of our best teachers are not too
practical and that power can come
from inspirational guidance as well
as by sheer dint of hard work.
Simonson's eulogistic chapter on
Adolphe Appia is, to date, the most
clarifying explanation of Appia's
place in the theater. The excellence
of this chapter is probably due to
the author's having delved into dif
ficult and obscure foreign texts, un
til now not opened to the unlinguis
tic.
He speaks of the sketch as being
"largely a dream—it's realization
often less than a nightmare." De
spite the wisdom of such statements
the well-informed student will re
member that Simonson's work in the
theater has been recorded by pho
tograph rather than by graphic
sketches. Whether it is of more
value to make scenic sketches and
try to x'eproduce them faithfully de
spite the occasional hiatus between
dream and actuality; or whether it
is better to record one's artistry in
photography as a finished reality is
a moot question.
The dearth of Simonson's sketches
and his persistent use of photogra

phy in representation of his work
leads the student to believe that his
ability to design .scenes on 'paper
might be negligible. However, we
cannot dispute the effectiveness of
Simonson's settings as portrayed by
photography—neither can we fail to
recognize the genius evident in a
wash drawing by Robert Edmonds
Jones!
The deliberate omission of all
names but those of Bel-Geddes,
Jones, Urban, Rosse, and Meilziner

suggests aloofness on the part of the
author. I should like to have had
him mention such members of the
younger school as Oenslager, Jorgu
lesco, Sovey, Peters, and others.
They have certainly contributed im
portantly to the American theater.
The author's enlightened review
of stage machinery leaves the read
er convinced that there is little in
modern theatrical effect that could
not have been equalled by the thea
ter of the past. In this discussion
the author, of course, excepts incan
descent lighting, giving it complete
credit as a modern force in produc
tion.
Through the book Simonson di
gresses pleasantly into almost every
high-way and by-way of dramatic
production, presenting in an amaz
ing fashion the CASE OF THE
THEATER, PAST, PRESENT, AND
FUTURE!
