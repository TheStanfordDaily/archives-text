Corporations must have the tariff
to protect their home markets. I
present these items from a list made
public by the Commissioner of Cus
toms; the per cent figure represents
the excess of DOMESTIC cost of
the article over the foreign cost, in
cluding transportation to the United
States, but LESS tariff:
Item Pet.
Black enamel Wellington boots 300
Men's storm rubbers 60
Swimming float 1350
Rubber dolls 90
Water pistols 500
Rubber erasers, square 150
5-inch celluloid dolls 450
7-inch celluloid combs 400
Thermos jugs, pint 50
Toothbrush, Dr. West style.... 50
Christmas tree lamps 320
Safety matches 100
Tennis rackets 200
Knives and forks 75
Hotel tea-pot 300
Men's cotton handkerchiefs ... 25
Imitation pearl beads 900
G-inch cutting pliers 300
Wrist watch glass blanks 300
This list should reveal the reason
for current uncertainties in the
stock market; all securities listed
therein, except utilities, will be di
rectly affected by any lowering of
tariff barriers.
Thirty-nine companies are main
taining the same regular dividend
rate as in 1929.
Stocks were irregularly weak yes
terday; averages moved down .25 to
close at 39.90. Brokers report that
75-90 per cent of present trading on
the exchange is of a professional na
ture.
Professional economic wowsers
attribute our economic situation to
extensive loans made abroad. Mak
ing these loans was the natural step
of the major creditor nation of the
world. From 1850 until 1914 Eng
land, then the world's banker, made
apparently conservative investments
in American securities which later

' turned out to be absolutely worth-
I less. England lost hundreds of mil
-1 lions in our early railroad ventures;
I she lost more millions in the bonds
of some of our choicest states; she
lost a fortune when the Confederacy
i repudiated its obligations; even as
I late as 1920 British investors saw
I huge equities vanish when the pro
hibition law in this country forced
! several domestic corporations to li
quidate. Verily, let those who have
! not sinned ....
