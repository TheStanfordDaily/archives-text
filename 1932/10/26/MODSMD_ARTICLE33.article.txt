The Editor, Sir:
i Did you know that "suicide cor
j ner" or "coffin corner" is not on the
; football field but is at the corner of <
j the Engineering Building? It is es
| pecially for frosh! They spot you a
I mile away, look over their sales talk
| outline and then accost you for your
season ticket to the concert and a
, Chaparral, if not for Thomas Social- j
j ism or the Quad. I never yet have !
been by there that Hoover's rugged
individualism or Roosevelt's love for j
trees has not been called to my at- !
tention. I have often wondered why
there is such a well worn path i
aroun the back of the Engineering
Building, but after adding to its deep i
cut contour, I am no longer ,\n the j
dark! This may be good training for |
sales resistance or sum'pn, but why j
cannot a man walk by and be un- j
molested? It really worries him.
