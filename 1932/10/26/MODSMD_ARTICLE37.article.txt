Figures have been received by
the Stanford Vocational Guidance
Committee, showing the increases
or decreases in the number of
workers in various vocations be
tween 1920 and 1930. These statis
tics are part of a national survey of
occupational changes.
The compilation of course does
not take into consideration the ef
fects of unemployment during the
depression years of 1931 and 1932.
C. Gilbert Wrenn, secretary of the
Vocational Guidance Committee, is
working on the compilation of fig
ures for California.

shown the largest increases. There
was a 249 per cent increase in po
lice women; a 246 per cent increase
in women real estate agents, bring
ing the total to 31,000; and 13,000
women insurance agents in 1930 was

bled in number; 638,000 of them be
ing a 126 per cent increase. Elec
trical engineers and forest rangers
showed increases of 114 and 126 per
;ent respectively.
Professions Increase
The data shows no decreases in
the professions and seems to reveal
hat the United States is approach
ing the saturation point in profes
sional workers. A decided decrease,
jf approximately half is shown in
nanufacturing and transportation
occupations.
A peculiar situation is revealed in
i 10 per cent decrease in the num
ber of women musicians and music
teachers (79,000) and a 48 per cent
n crease in men musicians and
eachers (85,000).
