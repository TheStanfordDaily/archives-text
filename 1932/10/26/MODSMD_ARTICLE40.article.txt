# MERCHANTS DEMAND SCHOOL STORE MOVE
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25.â€”Be
cause of determined opposition by
the Haight-Fillmore Merchants' As
sociation to a student Co-operative
store conducted on the campus of
the San Francisco State Teachers'
College, the Associated Students
planned to move the store to a new
location at 508 Haight street.
The merchants felt that the busi
ness obtained at the campus store
was hurting the trade of the estab
lishments already located in the
district. After a month of contro
versy the college authorities decided
to end the affair by removing the
Co-operative store to a new loca
tion. Alexander C. Roberts, presi
dent of the college, stated that he
regretted the necessity for the move,
but he was forced to comply with a
ruling of the state attorney-general
that the college had no legal right
to conduct a business on its prem
ises.
