# Yukon Bears Yield Gold To Professor
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 25 (/P).
—Even the grizzly bears wallow in
wealth in the Yukon region, Prof.
E. C. O'Roke, animal parasite ex
pert in the University of Michigan
forestry and conversation depart
ment, has found.
Professor O'Roke made his dis
covery when Prof. Dow V. Baxter
returned with four Silver Tip griz
zly bear hides after a summer near
Whitehorse, in the Yukon.
Professor O'Roke combed the
hides and then began "panning" the
bear dust in a small dish of water
in search of new kinds of animal
parasites. There were fleas, all right
—and gold dust.
'"Bear panning," however, does not
offer a get-rich-quick possibility.
The gold was in small amounts.
