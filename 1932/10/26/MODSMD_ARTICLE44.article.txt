# HORNSBY TO PLAY FOR CARDS AGAIN
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 25 (/P)â€”Rogers
Hornsby, who was deposed as man
ager of the Chicago Cubs, will take
the "comeback trail" with the St.
! Louis Cardinals next year.
Announcement was made today
: that the "firebrand" of major base
ball had signed a one-year contract
1 as a player with the club which he
! piloted to a pennant and world
j championship in 1926.
"The Rajah," it was announced,
I will go to the Cardinal training
i camp next spring as a candidate
I for a regular job as second baseman,
! the position where he starred in his
i heyday.
It was Breadon who, when Horns
i by was at the height of his fame,
1 traded him to the rJew York Giants
1 for Frank Frisch and Pitcher Jimmy
j Ring, although, as manager, Horns
' by had piloted the Cardinals to the
; world championship in 1926. And
j now Breadon thinks "the Rajah"
| deserves a chance to rehabilitate
: himself in the major league base-
I ball world.
