# REVOTES FOR ALL OFFICES IN ENCINA CLUB TO BE HELD
## Kendall, Kingsbury to Run For President 
### 
Encina Club elections held last
night resulted in a close race for
each office, and a revote is neces
sary for all positions as the pre
liminary voting failed to give any
candidate a wide enough margin to
win an office.
Those who will be running in the
final election are: Dean Kendall and
Hunt Kingsbury, for president; Bill
Boyd and Oct Morgan for vice
president; Hal Evarts and Pete Fox
for secretary-treasurer, and the
dance chairman finalists are Walter
Baird and John McFarland.
The final vote promises to be one
of the closest in the history of the
club, as all the contestants were
closely grouped. The race for the
presidency will be especially close
with two very well known candi
dates competing for the office. This
is the first time in several years
that the election did not produce a
single winner for any one of the
positions.
According to Ray Wilbur, who is
a member of the election board, the
revote will take place some time
during the next week, probably
Monday. All members of the club
are urged to go to the polls at this
final vote.
