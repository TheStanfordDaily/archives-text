# Tennis Players Enter Round Robin Tourney
## 
### 
Fall quarter tennis schedule is i
coming into its own, with challenge !
matches below the first ten men i
being played, and the round robin j
series of matches for the nine seeded 1
racket wielders also begun.
Varsity men this quarter seem to i
be in fine tennis form, due to the !
many state and various other tour- j
naments the players almost without '
exception engaged in during the
summer months.
Captain Coughlin and Cosgrove
have not been engaging in any seri
ous tennis thus far, probably be
cause Coughlin recently finished a
strenuous tennis season which in- I
variably brings a letdown and 1
needed a vacation with no emphasis I
on the game. Cosgrove probably
intends to round into shape slowly,
besides the fact that he possesses
a consistent game which requires |
but little polish to come right up
to its usual steadiness.
In the round robin matches But
ler defeated Forney by scores of
6-3, 6-2. Dan Ellis and Glenn Reed
stai'ted their match last week, and
were forced to quit because of
darkness at 10-10. Yesterday they
finished the match with Ellis tak
ing two straight and the first set,
and Reed coming back to take the
next two. i
