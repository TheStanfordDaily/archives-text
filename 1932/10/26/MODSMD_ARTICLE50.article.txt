Stanford for the quarter, has mys
teriously disappeared from his lodg
ings at the Sigma Nu house. His
fraternity brothers are debating
whether or not the flitting of the
dark brown Belgian police dog ac
cidentally coincided with the eve
ning of the U.S.C. game, and they j
claim that they are united in want- j
I ing their dog back.
Should he now be in Los Ange- j

desired a concrete or rather canine
