# JAPAN TO REVEAL NEW NAVAL PLAN AT GENEVA MEET
## Proposal to Compete with U.S., British Schemes 
### 
TOKYO, Oct. 25 (/P)â€”A new dis
i armament plan, distinctly Japanese
! and differing from the American
1 and British suggestions for naval
| reduction, is to be advanced by the

Japanese representative when the
disarmament conference resumes
next Friday at Geneva, it was re
vealed today.

A high official said the plan will
j embrace all naval categories and
J will be sufficiently complete to stand
! alongside the proposals by Presi
! dent Hoover and Stanley Baldwin.
The Naval Ministry already has
i drafted the plan and the Cabinet
! approved it today. Immediately
j afterward it was cabled to the
j Japanese delegation at Geneva.
It has not been decided whether
the plan will be made public before
j the disarmament conference re
j sumes, but the delegation at Geneva
or the Ambassadors in various capi
tals may inform the principal naval
powers of its details before that
time.
On the basis of statements in the
past by Japanese naval authorities,
Japan would confine reductions to
such vessels as are considered to be
offensive warcraft. These include
; aircraft carriers and capital ships.
