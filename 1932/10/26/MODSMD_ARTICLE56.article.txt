# LEAGUE-LEADING U.C.L.A. BRUINS PREPARE FOR INDIANS SATURDAY
## 
### 
j There's something pushing the
| U.C.L.A.'s Bruins to greater and
I greater efforts during their practice
I sessions this week for next Satur-
I day's game with Stanford.
It's eleven years of Bruin football
history—during which the Uclans
have risen from the depths of the
Southern California Conference cel -
lar to co-leaders of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
U.C.L.A.'s emergence from the
■ gridiron gutter has at times been
j provokingly slow, but it has always
j been steady. Its highest peak so
I far was reached when Bill Spauld
| ing's players defeated Idaho and
j Oregon in conference games, and
! swamped Caltech by a 51-0 score.
Two conference victories in two
starts! Rather a far cry from the
day when Los Angeles High smoth- i
ered the Bruins (then "Cubs"). In
1921 U.C.L.A. and Caltech opened
their series, and the Bruin's im
provement may be traced by the j
record of the Bruin-Engineer an- 1
nual games:
Year U.C.L.A. Caltech j
1921 0 32
1922 0 27
1923 (5 7
1924 G 59
1925 0 6
192(3 10 10
I 1927 3 7
1928 13 0
I 1929 32 0
j 1930 31 0
j 1931 30 0
1932 51 0 j
Improvement has been particu
; larly noticeable since 1925, Bill
j Spaulding's first year at the Holly
i wood and afterward Westwood in- i
stitution.
Spaulding's 1932 team has A !
[ strongly moulded line: one of the I
i best, forward wall units on the coast, I
!in fact, although individually the ]
j linemen may not be very strong, i
I Muller and McChesney are the first •
string ends; Yearick and McGue the
! tackles; Haslam and Boyer, are the

best guards; and Captain Homer
Oliver is the center. Bill Muller,
195-pound wingman, "Spec" Has
lam, a great blocking guard, and
center-pilot Oliver ai - e very nearly
as good as any line stars on the Pa
cific Coast. "Fat" Norfleet, a giant
tackle, is one of the hardest hitting
linemen on the coast and a two
year letterman, yet he is not good
enough to play on the Bruin first
string.
The U.C.L.A. backfield is one of
the heaviest in the country. There's
Mike Frankovich, the quarterback,
who has been dubbed "MeiTiwell"
since his long pass thrown from be
hind the goal line, which fell into
the arms of Raymond Livesay, sub
stitute halfback, just as the gun
sounded, and gave the Bruins a 12-7
victory over University of Oregon in
their most important game of the
season. Clark and Decker do the
halfbacking, and both are very fast
men. "Jolting Joe" Keeble, 200-
pound fullback, does the heavy line
pounding for the Bruins, and does
it so well that Howard Jones has
more than once expressed the wish
that Keeble were a member of his
Trojan squad.
U.C.L.A.'s greatest obstacle to an
undefeated season and a Conference
championship is of couVse the Stan-
California's Trojans do not play
Californiass Trojans do not play
their Westwood neighbors during
the 1932 season, so a tie for the title
is not inconceivable. Stanford is a
10-8 favorite, however, in the bet
ting on next Saturday's game.
