# MEIER SPEAKS ON PSYCHOLOGY
## Art Talents of Children Traced With Tests 
### 
Speaking in the Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series last night in the
Little Theatre, Dr. Norman Charles
Meier, psychologist-artist of the
University of lowa, declared that
"intelligence, environment, and mo
tor skills have very little to do
with artistic ability."
With the aid of colored plates,
Meier traced the technique and re
sults obtained with experiments
with the pre-sehool child. Ability
was found to increase with the age
of the subject until 56 months.
Then a steady level is reached which
is the true gage of artistic abiltiy.
Responses Tested
Responses to all the factors of
painting and drawing were tested.
Color harmony, balance, space fill
ing, imagination, memory, origin
alityâ€”all were closely examined
with the Meier Seashore Art Judg
ment Test. It was invariably found
that the talented attempts to im
prove upon his visual picture, while
the non-talented is usually content
with the barest reproduction.
A very marked degree of self
criticism was noticed in the talented
subjects. They make corrections,
stand off and judge, and talk at
length to observers in the room.
The non-talented are rather hasty,
make little attempts at correction,
and are much less talkative while
drawing.
Types Not Distinct
In close observation it was dis
covered that the talented are not
necessarily the calm, non-active
type. Only when a quantity of in
teresting observable features were
at hand, did the talented became
less active physically than their
non-talented mates.
To carry the tests still further, Dr.
Meier will attempt to use all known
artistic educational mediums to in
still art in the non-talented. Up till
now it has been found that the child
who will make a brilliant lawyer or
architect or who is generally tal
ented in other fields is not of neces
sity endowed with genuine artistic
talent.
