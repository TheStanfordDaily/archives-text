# Grays Favored In U.C. Battle
## 
### 
Making three times in as many
weeks that the Stanford Indian and
the California Bear tangle on the
gridiron, the annual game between
the Grays and Goofs will be played
on Saturday, November 12 at Berke
ley. The Big Game will take place
a week later ♦/hile the freshmen
are slated to settle Iheir feud on
the Saturday previous to the Gi"ay-
Goof encounter. Thus, the well
known Stanford-U.C. rivalry will
be given little time to calm down
between clashes.

Last year's "second-string Big
Game" resulted in an easy 25 to 6
victory for Stanford. The charges
of Coaches Cuddeback and Nevers
will probably be favored again this
year, although reports have come
across the bay of a Goof squad that
is strong enough to outplay the
regular vai-sity team. The same
rumors emanated last year, however,
so they can probably be discounted
to the extent of the three touch
down margin which the 1931 Gray
squad held over the Bears.
