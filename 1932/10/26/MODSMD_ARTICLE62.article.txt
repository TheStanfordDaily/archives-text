# COLVIN, OUT WITH GOLD, MAY BE ON BENCH SATURDAY
## To Drill On Weaknesses Displayed Against U.S.C. Saturday 
### 
"We've got to improve our punt- j
ing," said "Pop" Warner last night
as he lectured his squad for the pur
pose of pointing out a few of the
Stanford weaknesses in the Trojan
game. And so 22 men lined up a i
few minutes later on the practice
field to see how well they could
j punt in scrimmage.
I The first team of course took the 1
1 offense and Stun Anderson was in
j> the kicking department. And if An
derson can kick in action as well
as he did in this scrimmage last
night there is no question but that
j Stanford will never be outpunted j
I again this season.
Obstacle Buttled
, There is one obstacle, however,
I that must be overcome before this ;
otherwise perfect kicking combina
; tion will work. It is Stan's tendency i
to take his time in getting off these
( kicks. Three linemen had time to
charge in and block one of his boots
| last night while others went soaring
high into the air only in the nick
of time. But with a little more prac- 1
tice in such scrimmages Stan should
become almost as quick as Bill Sim.
Changes Hinted
More changes in the lineup were
hinted in this scrimmage, but Pop
I made no official announcement con
j cerning a starting eleven for next
! Saturday except that Tod may be
j shifted to left end. Don Colvin, reg
ular left wingman, is home with a \
. bad cold and may not be able to !
i start against the Bruins.
