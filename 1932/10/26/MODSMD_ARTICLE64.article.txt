WITH STANFORD PREPARING
FOR A WARM reception at the
hands of Mr. Spaulding's Bruins, El
Trojan taking his ease against the
hatlle v\ itli California in two weeks,
and Santa Clara's Broncs getting set
for their annual rodeo with the Ma
rauding Moragans, the Berkeley
Bears are holding the major portion
of the spotlight as they hurdle Ne
vada on the way to Los Angeles
w here shades of Benny Lorn stalk
every other year, hoping for a repe
tition of the 192!) victory.
That was the* year that the Bears
upset the Trojan cart 15-7, and
came back all set to smear Stan
ford. But that was one time that
Stanford took plenty ol advantage
of the underdog position to trounce
the Bears 21-(j and salvage the sea-

Now, with one defeat and one
victory as their conference record
to date, California's Bears are on
the upgrade, and although no one
has yet said that they expect an
upset, there are plenty of people
who would be ready to "1 told you
so" if California should repeat.
T'' they play up to their potential
ability, California's line, with the
possible exception of the ends,
should give the Trojans a whale ol
an argument. They are big and
tough, but up to the last week they
have failed to show much. Now,
with a win in the old coffers, they
may have been given the spark that
they needed.
It seems to us that some one said
at the beginning of the season that
Ingram was giving his boys a shift
because the crowds liked the shiit.
If that was so, he must have taken
it back because he found out that
they also like a winning team with
it.
Stanford has a shift too, but may
be it will drop its shift in the same
basket one of these days.
WITH THE RETURN OF STAN
ANDERSON to quarterback, and
the chances getting brighter every
minute that he will get to start the
U.C.L.A. game, it begins to look as
if the Cards will have a triple
threat quarterback to replace an
other • ip'e-threat barker.
Both Anderson and Campbell can
pass, kick and run with the ball. It
only remains to be seen how well
Stan can fil in with the experience
that he has had. He is the longest
punter on the squad, and if he can
get therp away fast he will be worth
keeping around for his punting if
lor nothing else. But we have an
idea that with the assurance he is
going to get in a game, he may
.show a lot of rapid improvement.
The boy can pass them straight
and hard too, and after last Satur
day's showing that counts a lot.

THAT FIRST PASS THAT U.S.C.
scored on last Saturday may have
been bum football, but it wasn't
Stanford sleepiness that let it score,
nor Stanford surprise; it was a com-,
bination of a number of things. In
the first place, it was supposed to
be a short pass, so that if it failed
they would still have the ball.
When Palmer went over the goal
line, one of the Redshirts followed
him just in ease he should get a
pass. Where the fatal error came
was in the Indian's failure to turn
around quickly enough to see the
pass coming, and knock it down. He
was facing Palmer when the Trojan
end went up after the ball.

ONE OF THESE DAYS, we hope,
Stanford is going to try sending two
or three, maybe four or five, men
around the ends with the ball car
rier. and when it works be so sur
prised at the yardage it piles up
that the old alma will insist on al
ways having interference for the
ball carrier on end runs.
It's awfully disheartening to
watch Stanford's ball carrier go
around end with one or two inter
ferers, and lose the ball when only
r« yard or two is needed. And then
see S.C.'s Mohler come right back
the next play with four men in
front of him to pave the way for a
ten or fifteen yard gain.
Stanford smeared Santa Clara's
umpty - ump reverses, and Troy
smeared ours. But when Troy gets
