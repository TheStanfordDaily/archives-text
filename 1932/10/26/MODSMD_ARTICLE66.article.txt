# Friday's Meet To Test Stars
## Track Men to Run Short Lengths on Old Oval 
### 
Continuing the weekly practice i
track meets, Coach Dink eTmple
ton and Bill Ellington will hold an- j
other of the abreviated distance af- i
fairs Friday afternoon on the old ;
oval. More to condition the men i
than to indicate their prowess, these j
meets serve as competitive work- j
outs.
The prowess of several new men j
will be watched with interest, as
these individuals will be needed to
fill up some of the gaps in the team
left by graduation. Joe Burris,
Harry Stark, and Art Rice are all
transfers of hopeful ability.
Burris Was Glendale Star
Burris comes from Glendale Jun- '
ior College with marks of 2 flat in
the half-mile and 50 in the 440.
Since 1931 Captain Alvin Hables,
Paul Nash and Allan Storms have
all received their diplomas, middle
distance runners can be used.
Rice is also a quarter-mil&r; com- |
ing from Menlo Junior College ac- j
companied by a neat 49 flat 440 j
record. Stark, who transferred last j
year but played baseball last spring, j
is now dividing his time between J
track and the diamond sport, and j
may run the sprints or the 440 for i
Templeton in the spring if he de- ■
cides he prefers it to heaving horse- |
hide spheres around. I
Quarter-Milers Good
The situation in the quarter, in
spite of the loss of Hables and Nash,
is encouraging. The Eastman and !
the Blackman boys need no intro- :
duction to Farm fans, and they're
all 440-men right now.
Captain Ben Eastman will of ;
course be outstanding, and sopho- ,
more Allan Blackman may easily j
turn out to be another Templeton !
quarter-mile star. Sam Eastman has
not quite decided whether he is a
quarter-miler, a half-miler, or just
a miler, while Don Blackman is !
again quarter-miling after years of j
;
up against Notre Dame it doesn't j
seem to figure out the plays in ad- j
vance.
You answer it; we don't want to! j
