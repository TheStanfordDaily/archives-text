# Spartans Meet Soccer Eleven
## Maloney Juggles His Lineup To Develop Team 
### Maurice Rapf 
One game won, one lost, and one j
tied! That's the way the record of [
; the Stanford varsity soccer squad j
! reads at the present time, with the ,
| fourth game of the season coming l
up Saturday when the team goes up '
1 against San Jose State on the local j
i field.
It will not be the first game of
i the season between these two elev- I
i ens, as Stanford won its season's j
! opener against the Teachers 2-1.
j Since that time the Indians have a
tie game with San Mateo and a loss
| to S.F.U. to their credit, or is it dis- I
, credit?
i
Probable Improvement
I Coach Maloney isn't convinced ;
that the season will be a failure yet, |
however. He believes that if the |
I squad, in the condition it was in j
| Saturday, could hold S.F.U. to a 4-1 j
I margin, it should be able to turn
j the tables on the Dons later in the i
I season when a more experienced
I scoring combination has been de
; veloped.
i With different line-ups on the i
I field every day, Maloney is con- !
j stantly searching for the eleven men
who will give him the maximum
] strength on the field at one time.
Except for a few positions, possibly
Carl Knecht at left wing, Art Hearn
at center forward, Cy Johnson at
inside right, and Erwin Brekelbnum
as one of the fullbacks, the first
team is still a wide-open aggrega- j
tion.
Yesterday's most outstanding dis- ;
covery was made when Laurie j
Washburn was given a tryout in the i
right wing position. Washburn I
started as a halfback, moved back i
to full, and now seems rather per- I
! manently set as the regular outside '
| right.
Charlie Emerick played at center ,
i forward in absent Art Hearn's place, j
j and played so well that he may get -
| one of the inside positions, along I
! with Johnson and Hearn.

; the Stanford varsity soccer squad j
! reads at the present time, with the ,
| fourth game of the season coming l
up Saturday when the team goes up '
1 against San Jose State on the local j
i field.
It will not be the first game of
i the season between these two elev- I
i ens, as Stanford won its season's j
! opener against the Teachers 2-1.
j Since that time the Indians have a
tie game with San Mateo and a loss
| to S.F.U. to their credit, or is it dis- I
, credit?

Probable Improvement
I Coach Maloney isn't convinced ;
that the season will be a failure yet, |
however. He believes that if the |
I squad, in the condition it was in j
| Saturday, could hold S.F.U. to a 4-1 j
I margin, it should be able to turn
j the tables on the Dons later in the i
I season when a more experienced
I scoring combination has been de
; veloped.
i With different line-ups on the i
I field every day, Maloney is con- !
j stantly searching for the eleven men
who will give him the maximum
] strength on the field at one time.
Except for a few positions, possibly
Carl Knecht at left wing, Art Hearn
at center forward, Cy Johnson at
inside right, and Erwin Brekelbnum
as one of the fullbacks, the first
team is still a wide-open aggrega- j
tion.
Yesterday's most outstanding dis- ;
covery was made when Laurie j
Washburn was given a tryout in the i
right wing position. Washburn I
started as a halfback, moved back i
to full, and now seems rather per- I
! manently set as the regular outside '
| right.
Charlie Emerick played at center ,
i forward in absent Art Hearn's place, j
j and played so well that he may get -
| one of the inside positions, along I
! with Johnson and Hearn.
