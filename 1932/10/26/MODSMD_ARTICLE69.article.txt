# 12-MAN TEAM BRAIN-CHILD OF OCCIDENTAL GRIDDERS

### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 25 (/P)â€”
Football enthusiasts have talked
i about twelve-man teams, but it re
mains for Occidental College of
' Eagle Rock, Cal., and the Santa
Barbara State gridsters to put the
j plan in vogue.
Announcement was made by ath
! letic authorities at Occidental Col
lege today that each team will put
j twelve men on the field when they
meet at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena,
' on the night of November 4.
The twelfth player will be termed
! a field general. On the offense he
j will go into a huddle with the other
j eleven players to decide what plays
I will be employed.
When the formation moves for
; ward he will drop back with the
I referee to see just how his brain-
I child works out and detect weak-
I nesses of the opposition.
On defense, the field general will

stand with the head linesman, taking
no active part in the functions of
his team. The plan is to have the
field general dressed differently, so
that in the excitement of the game
he cannot become involved in the
play without being detected easily.
The step is considered by Occi
dental athletic authorities as an
other in their plan to give the game
back to the students. Before the
season opened it was announced
that the team would be run by a
board of strategy, with players in
entire control.
The team lost its first three games,
but then staged the surprise of the
Southern California Conference by
defeating Whittier, considered as
the probable champion.
"We are desirous of seeing the
students take as active a part a.s
possible in the running of the
game," Phil Ellsworth, the graduate
manager, said.
