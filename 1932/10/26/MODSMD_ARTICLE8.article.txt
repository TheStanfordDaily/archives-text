# Keeble's Loss to Bruins Boosts Card's Chances
## 
### 
Stanford's chances in the all-im
portant U.C.L.A. game next Satur
day took a decided rise last night
when it was learned that "Jolting
Joe" Keeble, star Bruin fullback
had suffered a broken arm in prac
tice and will be lost for the rest of
the season.
Keeblo, who was counted for at
least All-Coast selection by West
wood rooters, is the man Howard
Jones referred to when he said "if
I had that youngster on my team,
I would have another national
champion."
