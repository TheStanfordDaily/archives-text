Something now in the stimulation ;
i of public interest in an oil promo- j
â–  tion scheme was uncovered yester
! day by Alameda county authorities
when they arrested seven men, I
seized five pistols, eight rifles, and a
! large quantity of ammunition, and
j invaded an oil drilling camp near
j Livermore that was fortified and
i armed like a section of France in
j 1918.
The "general" of the oil army is
i Austin N. Gilstrap, 3002 Logan
street, Oakland, who has offices at
i 366 Broadmoor boulevard, San Lc- ,
andro. He and an associate, Harry i
J. Jayne, were arrested and charged
I with two violations of the corpor- j
ate securities act and one of grand |
theft.
Four Nabbed In Raid
i Later a raid was made by eight '
| deputy sheriffs on the "fortress" in
; Patterson Pass, near Livermore, and j
' W. H. Johns, foreman, and four
workers were arrested and held for
investigation at Livermore.
According to Deputy District At- |
torncy Sam _ Berry, Gilstrap and !
Jayne had been selling oplions on
acreage in the district, and have
collected almost $50,000 in Alameda
[ county. The elaborate guard was
j explained by Berry as a ruse used
j by Gilstrap to attract attention to
! his promotion.
Gilstrap would inform prospects
that his chances for striking oil
were so good that the "big corn
panics" were hiring gunmen to raid j
the place, drive off the workmen
and blow up with dynamite his de
velopments, said Berry.
Attacks Faked
Occasionally Gilstrap would tele- j
phone a prospect in the middle of
the night and ask him to arm him
j self and come to Patterson Pass to
i repel an anticipated attack by these
gunmen, said Berry.
Berry said Gilstrap had sold 200 ;
| options on 1.11 acres each of land j
! owned by Mrs. Annie T. Johnson of I
; Livermore. These were sold for $250 |
j apiece and the sales were in viola
j tion of the state corporate securities '
j act, said Berry. The warrants were \
j sworn to by W. A. Riggs, 831 East j
1 Fourteenth street, one of the pur- j
! chasers.
I Gilstrap protested his innocence
and said the corporate securities act
had no jurisdiction over the sale
of options on oil lands. He was
[ booked at the Oakland city jail and
1 bail was fixed at $10,000 each for
i him and Jayne.
Find Land Guard
When the posse of deputy sheriffs,
headed by L. L. Van Patten and
j Hugo Radbruch, approached the
j Patterson Pass camp they found
, that the only entrance to the prop
j erty was guarded by a trench built
j with military efficiency, in which j
! riflemen might stand and shoot any- I
