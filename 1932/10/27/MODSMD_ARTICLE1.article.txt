# PARIANS WILL AIR POLITICS AT FORUM TONIGHT
## Candidates, Platforms Of Four Parties Will Be Upheld At Rally LT. BRYANT PRESIDES Audience Will Have Chance To Heckle Speakers 
### 
Four .speakers with the fire of
controversy in their eyes will take
the? platform in the Little Theatre
tonight at 7:150 o'clock to discuss
political issues before an Open
Forum audience.
Republicans, Democrats, Social
ists, and Communists will be repre
sented in tonight's discussion of the
four leading candidates in this
year's presidential election.
Wayne Bannister, member of the
varsity debate squad and president
of the Stanford Campus Hoover
Club, will defend the policies of the
present administration; Leonard
Bloom, another varsity debater and
runner-up in last year's Joff re de
bate, will espouse the Democratic
cause; Selden Osborne, president of
the Socialist Club on the campus,
will speak for the Socialist program;
and Fred Du Brutz will support the
Communist platform.
Each speaker will confine himself
to fifteen minutes of constructive
presentation, after which his oppon
ents will be allowed a total of ten
minutes to trip him up with ques
tions and dilemmas; finally, he will
be subjected to fire from the audi
ence. Heckling of all descriptions is
expected to enliven the Forum.
Bryant Chairman
Chairman of the discussion will
be Lieutenant-Commander Stewart
F. Bryant, a publicist of note and
a deep student of international af
fairs. He conducted a similar dis
cussion in Palo Alto two weeks ago
in which candidates for Congress
clashed, the questions, flying thick
and fast.
Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary politi
cal science fraternity sponsoring to
night's Forum, has suggested four
teen issues of a particularly con
troversial nature which it is hoped
each speaker will deal with at least
to some extent. These issues are not
in the least compulsory, but merely
serve to guide the discussion in the
most worthwhile channels.
Many Issues
Unemployment, farm relief, the
tariff, government expenditures, the
bonus, prohibition, and public utili
ties are listed as the main domestic
issues, and disarmament, war debts,
the League of Nations, the World
Court, recognition of Russia, Philip
pine independence, and intervention
in Latin America are expected to be
torn to pieces when the four speak
ers touch upon international affairs.
In order to eliminate every bit of
favoritism, the order of speaking
will be determined immediately be
fore the beginning of the Forum by
drawing lots. Details of discussion
conduct will be at the discretion of
Lieutenant-Commander Bryant.
