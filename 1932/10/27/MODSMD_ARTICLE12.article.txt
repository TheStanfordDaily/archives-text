# GREEK BOARD ADOPTS YEAR PENALTY RULE
## Rushing Invitation Cards To Go On Sale In A.S.S.U. Office Today 
### 
With reports of three cases of il
legal rushing before ii for investi
! Ration, the Interfraternity Board of
I Control took a firm stand against
| such practices by adopting as
1 drafted the one-year penalty rule
l at its meeting last night.
The rule which the Board prom
j ised to back to the limit is as fol
lows:
"Any house involved in illegal
! rushing shall not pledge any mem
ber of the lower division entering
j the University for the first time in
the school year in which the illegal
rushing occurs until one year from
i the pledging day in suchc school
i year, and rushes or rushees involved
shall not pledge any house for same
' period. Proviso: that the penalty
i may be modified if the Board is con
| vinccd that the circumstances war
; rant it.
Clauses Cited
The Board also reiterated three
I clauses of the rushing rules passed
last spring.
( a) Freshmen prior to pledging must
keep out of fraternity houses ex
cept on regularly permitted rush
i ing dates.
b) Fraternity men must keep out
of Encina except with Ihe per
mission of the Dean of Men or
a sponsor not a member of their
own chapter. Alumni may not
j enter Encina for purposes of
rushing.
c) NO ofT-campus rushing is per
! mitted except in the period be
tween quarters and in summer
vacation.
Alumni Parties
The question of alumni enter
i taining members of the freshman
I class was disc ussed at some length,
| and the Board went unanimously
lon record as being antagonistic
' against such action. A hope for
| alumni co-operation was expressed.
Since two fraternities were not
; represented at the last meeting of
| the Interfraternity Council, the
question of extending the limit of
pledges permitted each house from
! 10 to 12 was referred back to that
' body for representation and revote.
Schedule Approved
The schedule of midweeks and
; week-ends as passed by the Coun
| cil last week was definitely ap
proved.
j Official invitation cards will be
oil sale today at the A.S.S.U. office

The matter of providing an audi'-
j tor, which is favored by most
