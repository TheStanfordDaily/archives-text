# Borgioli Likes Stanford May Visit Campus During Engagement Lauds S. F. Opera House

Stanford liked Dino Borgioli last
night, and the charming Italian
tenor reciprocated with the an
nouncement that he likes Stanford.
He had never sung ; it an American
university before, and is very much
interested in Stanford especially.
Between tonight's performance of
"Faust" and the final one of "Travi
ata," Signor Borgioli hopes to be
able to pay a visit to Stanford.
Before the concert, the charming
tenor's charming English wife
wished him good luck, placing a
gardenia in his buttonhole. The
twinkle in the singer's eye was per
fect evidence of the harmony be
tween the two. Signora Borgioli
does not sing: "one in the family is
enough—too much, maybe," accord
ing to her husband.
The popular tenor is very fond of
San Francisco, whose new opera

I house he praised highly, calling it a!
J "comfortable" place in which to
sing. On his first visit to the United I
, States, three years ago, San Fran
cisco was the first city which he j
■ saw, and there he gave his first I
American concert.
With the gallant generosity of the j
I true artist, Borgioli paid tribute to,
! Arturo Toscannini, to Mario Cham- j
lee, and to John McCormack, "Ah,,
he is my favorite tenor." When
asked his favorite opera, lie replied,
1"I have none. 1 like any in which
; I sing with Muzio." The tenor and
the famous soprano have sung to
gether since early days in La Scala.
After rehearsing "Faust" since
early yesterday morning, Borgioli
gave his besi to the Stanford audi
ence, and impressed all as a si pen
! did artist and a charming Italian,
i gentleman.
