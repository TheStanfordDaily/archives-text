# DEATH TAKES SYMPATHETIC ROLE IN PLAY
## Casella Piece Interpreted By Capable Players Tomorrow Night 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
When the Assembly Hall curtain
rises tomorrow night at 8:30 on
"Death Takes A Holiday," the Stan
ford audience will view one of the
most remarkable of recent legitimate
plays, a fascinating excursion into
the realms of the imagination.
There are two conventional stage
ways of looking at death. There is
that which regards death as a re
lease from life's struggles, and that
which intensely fears the visit from
him whom men call the Grim Reap
er. Alberto Casella, the author of
tomorrow night's play, has chosen
neither of these aspects; he has a
novel and powerful plot, and he
writes of people who are not afraid
of death, but who live life to the
fullest, crowding every moment
with action.
Those people are gathered to
gether at a remote Italian castle, the
Villa Happiness, owned by Duke
Lambert de Catolica. To them comes
Death, not on his ciistomary errand,
but on a holiday. He had asked a
higher power if he would have this
vacation, the first in thousands of
years, and the request was granted.
Death Fascinates
The drama tells primarily the
story of two characters, but it re
lates also of the effect of the super
natural stranger on the guests, how
they are fascinated and repelled by
him.

skilled cast to enact Walter Ferris'
translation of the Casella play, and

ards set by former plays w,ill be
more than maintained.

Vallejo Ganter, who made a form
er excursion into the supernatural
in "Berkeley Square, - ' will play ( the
leading role tomorrow night, and

exacting demands of this play with
its deep emotion, and its subtle, sar
donic humor.
Virginia Wilson departs from the
ingenue role of "Bird in Hand" in
her portrayal of Grazia, the lovely
and understanding heroine.
Loos Plays Alda
Mary Anita Loos plays Alda, a
sophisticated and fascinating woman
who is attracted to Death but who
is unable to meet the ultimate test.
Joseph Wolfe's role of the Duke is a
difficult one; and Barbara Collins,
stellar campus actress, is cast as the
mother of Grazia.

Lambert. Fred Stover, whose set is

fullest, crowding every moment
with action.
