# U.S. Political System Poor, Says Barclay
## Roosevelt Straw Vote Lead Held Reliable 
### Bob Letts 
Without a presidency, American ;
politics would probably disintegrate j
within a short while.
In substance, this is the belief of j
Professor Thomas S. Barclay of the j
political science department, who j
yesterday took time eff from his de- i
part mental duties and pressing busi- 1
ness as a member of the Democratic |
State Central Committee of Cali- |
fornia to point out briefly one of ;
the glaring weaknesses of the party i
system.
"One of the chief difficulties in |
conducting a national campaign," j
said Professor Barclay, "is the fact j
that the American party system is j
little more than two loosely organ- i
ized leagues which exist for the pri- I
mary purpose of capturing the presi
dency. It is that office which holds :
together the illogical and almost ab- !
surd groups known as the Repub- i
lican party and the Democratic;
party, respectively.
"So long as the office of president ,
constitutes the great prize of Amer- i
ican politics, the present conditions j
will no doubt continue to prevail. I
"This situation, together with the j
practice of many voters to vote j
against a candidate and a party j
rather than for a candidate and a j
party, has introduced in our political i
practice the element of vagueness j
and uncertainty. The present cam
paign clearly indicates these diffi- j
cultics."
Pointing to the presidential straw |
vote polls of The Literary Digest
and other recognized standard guages |
of national public opinion, Professor!
Barclay answered a request for a I
prediction on the Battle of Novem- !
ber 8 by saying he believes the ;
present majority of Candidate j
Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a fair j
criterion of sentiment throughout i
the United States. He added that
the Digest's survey has been correct
in the last two presidential cam
paigns.
The closeness of the coming battle
has been indicated in the naming of
California as a "doubtful state" for
the first time since 1916. he con
cluded.
