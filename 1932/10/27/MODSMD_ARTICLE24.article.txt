# Nevers Returns To Grid Wars In Varsity Session
## All-American Fullback Dons Football Togs To Play For Grays In Scrimmage Against First String; Dazzles With Runs, Passes 
### DICK RODDA 
A GHOST of the gridirons returned to the scene of his greatest achieve
** ments yesterday. Six years out of college, weighing close to 210
pounds, Ernie Nevers felt again the itch ol the pigskin while watching a
scrimmage in which the Stanford Grays ran U.C.L.A. jilav s against "Pop*'
Warner's first eleven. Stanford's "Number 1," All-American fullback
in 102(i. and named by Warner as the greatest hack in football history,
"retired" from football following a brilliant finale in the Knights of
Columbus benefit game last year.
But yesterday Nevers could not resist the lure of thudding footballs and
swiftly moving bodies. Lining up behind the weak "Gra.v ' line, Never",
quickly fell into the scheme of the Bruin attack, and proceeded <o hand

Ihe varsity gridders a lesson in foot
ball that they will not l'orget for
some time.
Tosses Passes
Nevers was at his best tossing
passes. Stanford's All-Time All-
American looked one way, and
tossed them in another direction
dead into the hands of the receiver
â€”he Hung fifty yarders and short
bullet passes over the line with
equal speed and accuracy. The var
sity secondary defense was com
pletely befuddled as Nevers deliv
ered countless telling aerial blows.
Varsity on Defense
Varsity players remained on the
defense during the entile scrimmage
while the Grays imitated Bruin
plays with a fair degree of success.
Believing that U.C.L.A. will resort
to a kicking game in Saturday's
contest, relying on Bobby Decker to
keep them out of danger, most of
the plays were run from punt for
mation.

Indian hopes for a victory over
U.C.L.A.'s gridders soared today
with the announcement that Joe
Keeble, hard-driving Bruin full
back. will be unable to play in
Saturday's game because of a
badly-injured arm. Ransom
(Pants) Livesay, the lad whoso
last-second touchdown beat Ore
gon, will be shifted from a sub
stitute halfback berth to replace
Keeble.

Today's scrimmage ended heavy
preparation for Saturday's game*.
Tonight and tomorrow will consist
of "tapering-off" with practice of a
few new plays. Passing and punting
will be given serious consideration
in last-minute preparations.
Macntz Returns
Bob Maentz may be in Stanford's
starting "Big Game" brickfield. This
cheerful promise was given when
the triple-threat left halfback made
his first appearance on the field
since his injury incurred in the
Oregon State game. Don Colvin was
also in a suit last, night for the first
lime this week. The Indians' sensa
tional pass-catchcr has been laid up
with a cold but is expected to make
the trip to Los Angeles. In case he
is unable to play, Jay Tod will be
shifted to left and and Bill Doub
will start at right end.
Saturday's starting lineup and the
roster of the squad to make the trip
to Los Angeles will be announced
bv Warner tonight.
