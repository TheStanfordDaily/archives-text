# HASH AND GRAVY
## 
### 
Last week, while llie Daily was bemoaning the sup
posed discrimination of the Secretary of Labor against
foreign students who might wish to earn an honest dime
011 their way through college, there came to light another
ease here ;i! Stanford which is as flagrant a violation of
the principle of student self-support as this campus has
ever seen. The Daily learned that a head-hasher at Encina
Hall, holding one of the choice "gravy" jobs in the halls,
is not registered in the t'niversity this quarter.
The name of the man who holds this job, or position,
to be more accurate, is Pochard A. Hoffmann, former En
cina sponsor and dining room mogul. Now residing on the
fifth door of that hall, which also appears irregular, Hoff
mann, in addition to his dining hall duties, finds plenty
of employment around the RA.C. He will be found on Sat
urdays behind the grill in the "Will (-all" ticket booth at
the Stadium.
That constitutes considerable gravy on one dish, if any
one should put the question to you. A student holding two
sueli fine rackets in his grasp that would be fine. Hut for
;i former student, not at present registered, to ride such a
gravy train Hint is a gross miscarriage of justice on some
body's part.
There is the usual large number of names on the Bu
rma hashers' waiting list. Why shouiri a head-hasher be
chosen from without the ranks of Stanford students? Any
of the Stadium ushers and program salesmen would jump
at the chance of a job such as Hoffmann holds with the
B.A.C. I hey are students, men who are paying "In God We
Trust" money to attend the t'niversity. Why should the
Encina dining hall and the I'.A.C.. pay Hoffmann to hang
around the campus when, for some reason or other, he is
not paying out his gravy income for a Stanford education,
for the rights and privileges which belong to Stanford
men ?
