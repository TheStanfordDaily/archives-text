I-Yw fans in 11 it' stands at Saturday's gridiron battle
lealized the significance of the removal of Orv Mohler
from the game at the start of the fourth quarter. Few
realized that they were witnessing the curtain on one of the
coast's brilliant football careers.
It is particularly tough for the Trojans that their back
lield ace should receive the injury that took him out of
'heir lineup just when it began to look as though I\S.C.
were headed for another national championship.
Hut that is nothing compared to the pity of the break
that Mohler himself is getting. For two years he had been
overshadowed, in the Troy backfield, by two of the best
backs ever seen in these parts, Pinckert and Shaver. And
now, when lie is left to shine alone in his last and hesl
year, an injury robs him of his greatest opportunity.
Though Mohler has contributed not a little to the de
feats that Stanford has suffered at the hands of Trov.
everyone on the Farm views with regret the misfortune of
a stellar quarterback and a game sportsman.
