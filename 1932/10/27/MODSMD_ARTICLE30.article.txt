# BULL SESSION
## INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY 
### 
Certain queer notions attack the 1
public; and after a while, what
should appear queer and unusual,
has the stamp of acceptance placed
upon it. Then it is—that is if some
one indulges in what is basically
sound—the world throws up its
hands—gasps conspicuously — and
shakes its head most ominously.
One of these customary customs
that has firmly fixed itself in our
habits of thought is the little Polly
anna gag, that the victorious tennis
champion always hands to the loser.
After beating him most soundly—
getting over faster serves and more
cutting cuts—harder drives and all
the rest, he nonchalantly strolls up
to the net and while the cameras
click, the champion chucks out his i
little speech.
"Sorry, old man; luck was with
me; I am sure you're the better;
player." And the public applauds
most heartily. The champion is her
alded as a great sport. He is the j
ideal for Boy Scouts and "Y" bas- j
ketball teams. Everybody knows
that he is the better player—by far.
Everyone knows that he won
through superior skill. No one
knows this fact better than the
champion; yet if he should admit j
the truth, he would be branded as!
egotistical, vain, haughty, and a j
broad collection of sundry things. >

As a matter of fact, the victor
i probably is physically so exhausted
j at the end of the encounter that his
! brain cells have gone into a tem
; porary coma. Like a record, he
! merely repeats the things he has al
; ways repeated. He never considers
] that he is deliberately lying to carry j

Icn a tradition—so fallacious on the
surface that its value cannot be
lasting or great.
Of course, if the habit merely
confined itself to the tennis court,
all would be well—or at least all
would not be so bad. But no, prac
tically every phase of our daily
slither is infested with equally in
sipid bromides. These bromides are
added to by popular usage—and at
tain the consistency of iron ore.
Nowhere is this so evident as in
the social customs between the
sexes. Prime example is the annoy
; ing ceremonial that takes place at
the end of every date. Both parties
are frankly ill at ease. No one
knows exactly what to say and as
a result, the old song is mustered
: into service. She (coyly): "I've had
a great time." He (pleased): "So
i have I." So ingrained in us has this
. become, {hat if she slips and forgets
S Ihe platitude, he is bewildered.
This fomula is pressed into action
i even though both people know the
! public, and after a while, what
evening has been a total washout.
Neither even stop to consider saying
something more in line with the
facts; it's never done. Any kindness
. or simple beauty that may have at-
I tached to this folksy little habit has
j long since disappeared. The mechan-
I ics of the whole thing have become
iso perfected that they have com
pletely ground out any significance
that may have once attached.
And while traditions are splendid,
their splendor turns to black dust
when put on a machine-age, mass
i production, cash-and-carry, all
harsh-irritants-removed basis.
