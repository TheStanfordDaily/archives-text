MOVIE CRAZY (Harold Lloyd
Corporation) — At the Varsity
Theatre.
Harold Lloyd's first picture in two
years differs very little from his
usual banana peel comedy. The hero
is forever wrecking the surround
ing scenery, always does the wrong
thing, and gets into all sorts of
crazy situations—although this is one
picture where Lloyd does not find
himself climbing up or down the
outside wall of a skyscraper. The
romance seems a little out of place,
as usual.
The picture is well up to Lloyd's
standard, and he is one of the best
in this type of comedy. If you like
the type, you are sure to like this
picture.
Constance Cummings, who does
her unexacting part well, seems a
good bet to uphold the tradition
that being leading lady to Harold
Lloyd is one sure way to stardom.
She is exceedingly pretty and
charming.
The plot, which is entirely unim
portant, deals with the hero's trou
bles while trying to break into the
movies. It comes out all right, of
course. —Johnson
LOHENGRIN (Wagner) —At the
War Memorial Opera House.
This presentation was, all things
considered, the best so far this sea
son. As in Rigoletto the whole cast
sang with unusual brilliance, and

] this time had a far better opera to
! work with. Mario Chamlee as
Lohengrin and Louis d'Angelo as
, the king both turned in better per
formances than one would have ex
pected. Chamlee has all the require
ments necessary to make a first
class Wagnerian tenor, and these
I showed even better than they did
in Meistersinger. His long scene
with Elsa in the third act revealed
a depth of expression rare in any
tenor, combined with equally rare
acting ability.
Friederich Schorr sang the role of
Telramund with his usual perfec-
I tion—his reputation as the greatest
Wagnerian baritone has not been
misplaced. Ksthryn Meisle in the
I dramatic role of Otrud had perhaps
] the most difficult part in the opera:
the role demands not only an un
usual range, but also great volume
I and an ability to act. It is the hard
j est part to make convincing, but she
| succeeded admirably. Maria Mueller
sang Elsa. and her performance was
' on a par with those of the others.
The chorus work was irregular:
! the tenors continually troubled by
| the high notes, and the ensemble
i ragged in the wedding march. But
|on the whole its work was better
than average. The settings were de
j plorable, as usual, with the added
• difficulty that the swan would not
> sink and the mechanical doves had
; to be hauled in by a stage hand.
I This marred the conclusion of an
, excellent opera. —Zimansky.
