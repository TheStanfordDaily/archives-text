The Editor, Sir:
It has been said that a football
team is as strong as its reserves. I
believe that a goood football team,
on the particular day of play, is as
strong as the support given by its
rooting section.
Stanford had a great football team
on the field last Saturday. Why
were they beaten? Because their
efforts were not backed up by that
highly touted Stanford spirit. This
spirit, so well known outside of the
Farm, has been riding the slippery
skids for the past several years.
There was a time when rooting sec
tion rivalry exemplified itself from
the time the rooters arrived in the
Stadium until the end of the game.
I believe in showing good fellow
ship, giving a yell for the opposing
band, and by all means a cheer for
the injured man on the opposing
team—courtesy must, not be over
shadowed by spirit. However, Stan
ford yell leaders need someone to
inject some fighting spirit of the
olden days into them, so that they
will not let the rooters sit idly by
when eleven men are doing their
utmost to htave off defeat.
You old grads on the farm—look
into this situation, and let's not have
the rooting section give up as they
did in the California game last No
vember, and give out that impres
sion of over-confidence as was
shown last Saturday in the U.S.C.
game.
Sincerely,
