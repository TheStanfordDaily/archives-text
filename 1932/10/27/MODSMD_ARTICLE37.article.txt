Stocks were firmer yesterday,
averages moving up .8!) to close at
40.75. Volume was slightly under
1,000,000 shares.
Unverified reports from New York
brokers mention large scale buying
operations by "wise" money.
Prior to Steel's declaration of the
regular preferred dividend a few
days ago the stock was lending at a
premium of $3 per 100 shares, indi
cating a substantial short interest.
The assertion of Montagu Norman,
governor of the Bank of England,
that present economic conditions are
beyond the control of any man or
country has doubtlessly had its ef
fect on the market of the past ten
days.
Steel companies' prices for rails

creased rail buying by roads now

Despite one broker's droll com
ment that Hoover has been re
quested to vote for Roosevelt to
make it unanimous, sentiment to
ward re-election of the President
is increasing. Factories and corpora
tions have appealed to employees to
vote Republican to insure continua
tion of the present economic recov
ery.
As a result of tightened economic
conditions railroads and other in
dustries are giving a great deal of
study toward devising curbs on
competitive waste within the in
dustry. One of the major problems
facing the rails is a solution for the
bus-truck passenger-ireight compe
tition. While busses and trucks oper
ate more economically than rail
roads the latter are absolutely
necessary to care for the country's
transportation needs.
