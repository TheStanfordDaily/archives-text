ALTIIOUGII U. S. C. GOT
AWAY with concentrating 011
stopping Ernie Cuddel, it is
doubtful if (lie Bruins will be
able to do the same thing. For
one item, Hill Sim probably
learned a lot in his first crack
at real big time stuff, ami for
another U.C.L.A. has no Trojan
line to count 011, and for still
another Stanford will be able to
run its end plays a lot wider
this Saturday.
Caddel is gradually getting over
the effects of his injury and should
bo hitting with all his old power
down South. He took a lot ol pun
ishment, as did most of the Indians,
but his injury was not aggravated
very much.
Having Caddel, Sim, Anderson or j
Campbell, and Hillman or Baker in ;
our backfield is going to give Coach
Bill Spaulding plenty to worry
about. And he has a lot to moan
over already.

SPAULDING STARTED THE
SEASON with enough tackles to
keep four teams in the running,
and then (lie faculty axe cut oIT
no less than five of them.
He has a seasoned quarterback
in Lenny Begdahl, and a prom
ising sophomore in 1 rankovitib.-
He had a fine fullback in
"Jolthr .!< .y" I
looked as if ! • v.
conference < <». .
not have to play \\■
U.S.C., or CaKfor..' .
Now, with th ■ all-imporl- u1 ;
ford game just three days aw. .',
Brother Bill views the wreck <'«g<
with a synical smile.
His tackles are three, perhaps
four. That is, men who have played
enough so that he knows they can
stand the beating that they are
bound to get against Stanford.
His varsity quarterback has not
played a game, and it doesn't look
as if he is going to get in any. His
sophomore star has done very well
so far, and even has credit for hav
ing pulled the Oregon game out of
the lire. But in the first place Ore
gon gave the game away when
young Temple forgot his instruc
tions and passed into the hands of
a Bruin, and m the second place, |
sophomore quarterbacks have a fail
ing for blowing up when they get
in crucial contests.
And as if this weren't enough,
"Fat" Norfleot, giant tackle, was put
out of the way in the Oregon en
counter, and Tuesday, Keeble broke
his arm.
With all this to battle, Spaulding
is taking on a Stanford team that
has never been fooled by his offense
long enough to drop a game, and one
that is just set to win this contest.
AFTER LAST YEAR'S hair
raising, last-minute finish one
would be a lunatic to predict an |
easy victory over the Bruins, j
but there IS much to it!
Spaulding has always been known j
for his defensive teams, NOT for his i
offensive elevens. Even when he was I
coaching at Minnesota he had this I
reputation, largely aided and abet- j
ted by the efficient way that his out
fit stopped the great "Red" Grange, j
Spaulding's present creation will j
do most of its scoring against Stan- 1
ford, if any, through the air. And !
Stanford has learned enough about j
pass defense this season to prevent j
any scoring along that line for the |
rest of the conference race.
U.C.L.A. might break Bobby
Decker away for a long run, but this
too is doubtful. So that brings us
right back to the first guess, that I
the Bruins will have to take to the J
air. And that means Frankovitch to
anyone that he thinks he can reach,
preferably the sprinter Sinclair Lot.
At any rate there will be no
such upset interference as
wrecked Stanford's plans last
week-end, and with the added
attack that the Indians possess
this year, Stanford ought to give
Mr. Spaulding's Bruins their first
conference setback.
