# TROJAN FRESHMEN TO BE UNDERDOGS AGAINST PAPOOSES
## Trobabes Victorious In But One Contest In Five Game Schedule 
### 
The much-battered U.S.C. fresh
man football team comes to the
Stanford Stadium next Saturday,
with a season record of one victory,
one tie, and three defeats, yet with
high hopes of upsetting Stanford's
j undefeated yeailing eleven.
No definite conclusion may be
; reached by comparing the records
of the two teams, for the two fresh-
I man teams have confined their
schedules to teams in their own
; sections of the state:
Stanford Frosli
34 Fresno State Fr. 7
34 Taft Junior Coll. 0
18 Glendale J.C. 0

Even though the Trobabes' v;i..:
improvement is taken into consider
ation, Stanford's undefeated and un
tied freshmen are natural favorites
to win. The Class of 1936's football
team has enjoyed a more successful
early season than any other Papoose
team of recent years.
If "Chuck" Winterburn's players
are even slightly overconfident,
however, they will be due for a bad
fall.
The Stanford varsity had a far
better practice season record than
the Trojan varsity, but this did not
help them after the whistle had

Stan ford Favoted
Even though the Trobabes' v;i..:
improvement is taken into consider
ation, Stanford's undefeated and un
tied freshmen are natural favorites
to win. The Class of 1936's football
team has enjoyed a more successful
early season than any other Papoose
team of recent years.
If "Chuck" Winterburn's players
are even slightly overconfident,
however, they will be due for a bad
fall.
The Stanford varsity had a far
better practice season record than
the Trojan varsity, but this did not
help them after the whistle had
| blown to start last Saturday's game.
