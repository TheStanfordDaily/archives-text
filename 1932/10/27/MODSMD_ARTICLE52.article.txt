### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2G (/Piâ€”
California's first football fatality for
1932 came yesterday with the death
of Harry Lawlor, 18, freshman stu
dent at St. Mary's College, Moraga.
The youth died at the Providence
Hospital, Oakland, from injuries re
ceived last Thursday in an interclass
game on the campus.
As a result of the accident,
Brother Leo, chancellor of the col
lege, issued an order banning Amer
ican football in all interclass games.
The order does not affect the fresh
man or varsity teams.
Member of Class Team
Lawlor was not a member of the
regular freshman team, but of a
class team recruited for a game with
the sophomores. During the game
Lawlor, playing at right end, met
Harry Masterson, sophomore half
back, in a terrific open field tackle.
Lawlor's head hit Masterson's
waist, which was heavily padded.
His spine was telescoped by the
force of the collision, and he was
given little chance to recover.
The boy played end last year 'on
the McClymonds High School team,
Oakland. He was the only child of
Mr. and Mrs. John Lawlor, 153 i
Union street, Oakland, who were
with him at the time of his death.
Orders Touch Tackle
Brother Leo said that hereafter
only "touch tackle" football will be
allowed in interclass contests. In
this game a player is considered
tackled when an opposing player
touches him, and blocking is also
prohibited.
