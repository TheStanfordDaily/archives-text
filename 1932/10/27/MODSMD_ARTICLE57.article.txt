## 
### BY STAN BEAUBAIRE 
His name is Caddel, and they call
him Ernest Wiley, Jr. The folks
back home in Tulare raised him to
take a pre-med course at Stanford,
but Ernest Wiley, Jr., decided he'd
rather spend some time carrying
footballs for this man called Warner.
More popularly recognized in the
news columns as the "blond adonis,"'
Caddel is about to earn a new
monicker for himself, for in the
future it will be "Ernie Caddel, the
Lion Man."
The news is out. Paramount Pic
tures has asked the scintillating
Indian right halfback to journey
southward for a screen test in Holly
wood. He is wanted to do some first
class "lioning" in a big jungle thril
ler scheduled for an early release.
He has been asked to fill the part
of the "Lion Man" in the flicker fea
ture to be called "King of the
Jungle." According to Paramount
authorities, he is built perfectly for

I the role, which calls for the follow
ing specifications in the proposed
I man of the jungles.
He should be (i feet, 1 inch tall;
, weight, 190 pounds; chest, 41 inches;
| biceps, 15 inches; neck, 17 inches.
It is absolutely necessary that he
possess a "magnetic personality, be
good-looking, have a strong speak
ing voice and some adaptability for
acting."
And Paramount thinks that Ernie
has "it." Or, these, anyway. Al
! though Caddel doesn't quite agree
yet, he's willing to give it a try
: regardless.
Jumping Joe Savoldi, Notre Dame
star, failed to secure the part in a
previous tryout because he was un
able to meet the requirements of
: "matinee idol" standards. If Ernie
gets the job, he will not start his
"lioning" until the end of the pres
ent quarter, when he will receive his
I diploma.
