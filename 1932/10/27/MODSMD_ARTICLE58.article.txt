## 
### 
Professor E. K. Strong, Jr., of the
psychology department, has devel
oped two new scoring scales, one for
accountants and one for dentists.
These scales have just been pub
lished on his vocational interest
blank by the University Press. He
has also revised his scoring test for
certified public accountants.
The tests are given to discover
people's interests and thus help them
select a vocation in which they
could be happy, In connection with
the development of the accounting
scale, Professor Strong found sur
prisingly little correlation between
the interests of accountants and cer
tified public accountants. They have
quite different traits and belong in
entirely different groups although
apparently quite similar.
