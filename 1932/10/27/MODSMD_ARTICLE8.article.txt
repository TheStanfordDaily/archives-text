# Hoover Carries Campus In Daily's Straw Vote
## Socialists Cut Republican Lead; Bourbons Steady 
### Rolph Malloch 
j Still strong for Hoover—but not j
j as strong as four years ago, due to
i the advance of the Socialists.
That, in brief, is the result of the
Daily's straw vote on Stanford
opinion concerning the Presidential j
i campaign.
Hoover first, Roosevelt second,!
! Thomas third. A total of 1301 stu- i
! dents voted. Hoover received 828 j
j votes, Roosevelt 25.1, and Thomas j
I 216. This gives the Republicans j
j 63.4% of the total, the Democrats j
! 19.4%, and the Socialists 16.7%.
Socialists Gain
Four years ago, in a similar cam- i
pus straw vote, 75% of the ballots
were cast for Hoover, 21% for the i
Democratic candidate, and 2.5% for j
Thonvas. Compared to ihis year's!
percentages, it will be seen that the j
i Democrats practically held their |
own, while a heavy Republican loss
was balanced by a tremendous So-
I cialist gain.
As a result of four years of prog
ress, the Communist vote for Foster]
j was increased 100%. In 1928 Foster j
i received 3 votes, this time he polled j
| 6 votes.
Gump Gets Vote
i Upshaw, Prohibition Party candi- j
j date, came in fifth in the balloting, |
j his total amounting to 3 votes. One I
J vote each was cast for Theodore J
| Roosevelt, Andy Gump, William i
] Jennings Bryan, and Ulysses S. i
i Grant.
Acting-Presidcnt Swain exactly j
| tied President Wilbur's record of]
| four years ago, each of these write- |
j in candidates polling one vote.
| Will Rogers' total fell from the j
I eminence of 6 ballots to the same 1
j class as Bryan and Andy Gump this :
J year with one vote.
Of the total vote, 76% of the bal
| lots were cast by men and 23% by
1 women.
Women Want Hoover
Of all the candidates, Roosevelt's
| total contained the largest percent
| age of male votes. Hoover's vote
I shows a greater percentage of
! women than his opponents. Of '
! Roosevelt's votes, 84.5% were cast !
|by men, and 15.5% by women. !
i Thomas' ballots showed 82.5% men j
| and 17.5% women, while Hoover's j
i were 76% men and 24% women. j
Social Science majors did more |
i voting than did any other major- j
I department group. Freshmen and i
: seniors indicated a tendency to vote I
j for Hoover, while the largest So- I
j cialist part of the poll came from
I juniors. Roosevelt admirers seem to i
i be scattered throughout the classes!
I more thoroughly than the adher- j
| ents of the Republican and Socialist i
j parties.
No Ballot Stuffing
Accuracy was insured by having i
| two watchers at the polls constant- i
| ly, and sealing of the ballot box ;
j overnight. No indications of unfair- j
i ness have been unearthed. The poll
was conducted by the Daily with
J the help of the official Election j
I Board.

pus straw vote, 75% of the ballots
were cast for Hoover, 21% for the i
Democratic candidate, and 2.5% for j

was balanced by a tremendous So-
