# CURTAIN RISES ON DRAMA OF DEATH TONIGHT
## Gantner To Interpret Lead In Alberto Casellaâ€™s Imaginative Play STOVER DESIGNS SET Harold Helvenston Directs Cast Of Twelve 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
' Death Takes A Holiday" tonight.
"Weary of isolation, weary of the
fear with which men always greeted
him; curious to learn what men
found in life that made them cling
to it so desperately, and shrink In
terror wh en he plucked their
sleeves," Death this evening stalks
the stage in the guise of a mortal.
Starts At 8:110 O'clock
Deatli comes to the Stanford As
sembly Hall stage at 8:30 o'clock,
when the curtain will rise on Harold
Helvenston's production of Alberto
Casella's play, translated by Walter
Ferris, and enacted in a setting de
signed by Frederick Stover.
The production of the Italian au
thor's unique drama is not a new
departure for Helvenston and Sto
ver, who a year ago presented Stan
ford audiences with a beautiful per
formance of John S. Balderston's
"Berkeley Square."
Death Takes lioliday
For three days no leaf falls; for
three days roses remain fragrant and
fresh in a bowl; for three days there
i.s nowhere in the world the tolling
of a funeral bell. Death is taking a
holiday.
Its author describes the stoiy as a
tragic fable. It is more than that;
it is a play, beautifully and poeti
cally conceived, which will lift the
beholder out of the ordinary.
Well-Fitted Cast
"Death Takes A Holiday" is an
extremely difficult play to cast, and
Helvenston has chosen a cast which
is eminently well-fitted to enact the
Casella drama. The cast is as fol
lows:
Cora, the maid Mildred King
Fedele, manservant... .Jimmy Benet
Duke Lambert de Catolica
