j LONDON, Oct. 27 (/I 3 )â€” Rioting
! unemployed, shouting defiance at
the police, participated today in the
J most serious disturbance of the kind
! that London has seen in years.
Fifty thousand people were
j massed inside Hyde Park and at the
! several entrances as a column of
i several thousand jobless marched in
| for a demonstration in protest
j against administration of the dole
I system.
In Great Cumberland place, op
posite the marble arch entrance on
j Edgewai'e road, a brick was thrown
, through the postoffice window.
Mounted police charged, swinging
their clubs, and the mob fell back,
| cursing and booing.
Police Attacked
The police retired and the crowd
j swept in again upon them. Time
after time the horses pressed back
the mob, withdrew, and the mob
i surged in again.
Stones and mud whizzed past the
] policemen's heads. Several persons
j were injured and taken away in
j ambulances.
This fighting took place over a
300-yard section along the bridle
I path from the marble arch west
! ward.
Meantime the throng inside, which
had been listening in an orderly
manner to speeches lrom fifty soap
j box orators, suddenly became rnen
j acing.
Mobs Form Inside Park
Attracted by the affray at the
I marble arch, mobs began to gather
i inside the park railings.
j The mounted police extended
! their charges along Bayswater road
.as the crowds before and behind
I them grew more hostile.
The rioters pulled branches from
(he trees and tore up the park rail
! ings as weapons. They threw any
; thing that came to hand.
One mounted policeman was sepa-
I rated from his galloping squad. His
| helmet was knocked off by a stone,
j As the fighting grew more fierce
| a score or more injured were car
ried away, some of them apparently
! hurt seriously.
