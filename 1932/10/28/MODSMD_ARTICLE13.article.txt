Hunt Kingsbury, end on the In
dian freshman football team, was
voted Encina Club president last
night. Kingsbury's election over
Dean Kendall was by a 105-81 vote
margin.
Bill Boyd defeated Oct Morgan
for the vice-presidency by a 97-87
vote in the closest vote of the elec
tion. The position of secretary
treasurer was won by Hal Evarts,
guard on the yearling grid squad.
Evarts defeated Phil Prescott 103-80.
The important position of the 1932
dance chairman, who is in charge
of the annual Encina Formal, went
to Chug Mosher, who received 109
votes to 75 for Walt Baird.
The Encina Club election should
not be confused with the regular
freshman class election to be de
cided in the near future.
