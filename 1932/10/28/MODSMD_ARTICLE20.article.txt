# EXCITED CROWD HEARS ORATORS GIVE PARTY AIMS
## Little Theatre Packed As Four Sides Of Present Campaign Are Argued 
### 
Four student speakers, fired by j
the enthusiasm of a clapping, stamp- |
ing, cheering audience which packed
the Little Theatre to overflowing, I
last night aired the policies of the ;
four leading parties of the 1932 cam- j
paign and assailed each other's
statements in a period of hot ques- j
tioning.
Drawing the lot of the first speak
er, Fred Du Brutz, Communist rep
resentative, uttered the first contro- \
versial words of the Forum. Du
Brutz dwelt at length on the suffer- |
ing attendant upon the present de- j
pression, and denounced imperial- :
ism.
Communist Proposes
He advocated immediate unem- 1
ployment relief and the abolition of ;
enforced payment of debts and rents !
by those in dire need. "The Com
munist party does not suggest, does j
not offer, does not propose, does not
recommend; it demands unemploy- j
ment insurance at the expense of'
the state and at the expense of em
ployers," he said.
Wayne Bannister, upholding !
President Hoover's administration, j
pointed out three fundamental tests j
of the worth of a political party: a i
clear and sound political philosophy, j
a practical program for meeting |
present issues, and personal leader
ship. Bannister said, "I don't ask [
any sentimentglism for a system we j
have had, just because we have had
it, but because it is fundamentally j
sound.''
Answers Questions
After praising the Republican re
construction program, and flaying !
the Democrats for their hindrances,
Bannister answered questions from
the opposition and from the floor; i
one of the floor questions answered !
was indictment of the Republican j
prohibition stand by Professor Bar- |
clay.
Selden Osborne, Socialist repre- j
sentative, began by thanking Du \
Brutz for indicting the capitalistic 1
system. He then went on to tell a j
story of monkeys that would not!
starve in the micLst of bananas, and !
suggested that in this country we I
entrust our governmental reins to
even less intelligent; animals—don
keys and elephants.
Osborne urged that democracy, |
now existed in form only, should be j
raised to reality by its extension!
into industry. He warned the audi- j
ence not to waste their votes on
either capitalist party, but instead
to build a party for peaceful revo
lution by supporting the Socialist)
ticket.
Audience in Uproar
Drawing the lot of the last j
speaker, Leonard Bloom rallied to
the cause of the Democrats in a j
lively speech packed with humor)
that elicited many a response from
the audience. He struck at three is- i
sues which he considered the "worst j
running-sore, ulcer, and cancer," j
respectively, in the body politic to- j
day—the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the |
prohibition question, and the pres- j
ent administration's handling of the
public utilities. An uproar in the I
audience followed several slips of '
theh tongue by both questioners j
and by Bloom in which the "Hoot- j
Smawley" tariff was mentioned re- i
peatedly.
Orderly procedure was maintained i
by Lieutenant-Commander Stewart j
F. Bryant, chairman chosen by Pi I
Sigma Alpha, honorary political :
science fraternity sponsoring the j
Forum. Bryant pointed out the fact \
that a Forum similar to last night's!

the Little Theatre to overflowing, I
last night aired the policies of the ;
four leading parties of the 1932 cam- j
paign and assailed each other's
statements in a period of hot ques- j
tioning.
Drawing the lot of the first speak
er, Fred Du Brutz, Communist rep
resentative, uttered the first contro- \
versial words of the Forum. Du
Brutz dwelt at length on the suffer- |
ing attendant upon the present de- j
pression, and denounced imperial- :
ism.
Communist Proposes
He advocated immediate unem- 1
ployment relief and the abolition of ;
enforced payment of debts and rents !
by those in dire need. "The Com
munist party does not suggest, does j
not offer, does not propose, does not
recommend; it demands unemploy- j
ment insurance at the expense of'
the state and at the expense of em
ployers," he said.
Wayne Bannister, upholding !
President Hoover's administration, j
pointed out three fundamental tests j
of the worth of a political party: a i
clear and sound political philosophy, j
a practical program for meeting |
present issues, and personal leader
ship. Bannister said, "I don't ask [
any sentimentglism for a system we j
have had, just because we have had
it, but because it is fundamentally j
sound.''
Answers Questions
After praising the Republican re
construction program, and flaying !
the Democrats for their hindrances,
Bannister answered questions from
the opposition and from the floor; i
one of the floor questions answered !
was indictment of the Republican j
prohibition stand by Professor Bar- |
clay.
Selden Osborne, Socialist repre- j
sentative, began by thanking Du \
Brutz for indicting the capitalistic 1
system. He then went on to tell a j
story of monkeys that would not!
starve in the micLst of bananas, and !
suggested that in this country we I
entrust our governmental reins to
even less intelligent; animals—don
keys and elephants.
Osborne urged that democracy, |
now existed in form only, should be j
raised to reality by its extension!
into industry. He warned the audi- j
ence not to waste their votes on
either capitalist party, but instead
to build a party for peaceful revo
lution by supporting the Socialist)
ticket.
Audience in Uproar
Drawing the lot of the last j
speaker, Leonard Bloom rallied to
the cause of the Democrats in a j
lively speech packed with humor)
that elicited many a response from
the audience. He struck at three is- i
sues which he considered the "worst j
running-sore, ulcer, and cancer," j
respectively, in the body politic to- j
day—the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the |
prohibition question, and the pres- j
ent administration's handling of the
public utilities. An uproar in the I
audience followed several slips of '
theh tongue by both questioners j
and by Bloom in which the "Hoot- j
Smawley" tariff was mentioned re- i
peatedly.
Orderly procedure was maintained i
by Lieutenant-Commander Stewart j
F. Bryant, chairman chosen by Pi I
