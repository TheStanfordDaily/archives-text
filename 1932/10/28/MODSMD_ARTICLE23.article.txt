# Ex-Grid Player Slays Man After Swindle Attempt
## Former Santa Clara Star In Yreka Shooting 
### 
YREKA, Oct. 27 (/P)â€”Like the
clays when the "six gun" put a stop
to the "cold deck," bullets spat with
deadly effect in a war on suspected
punch board swindlers at Happy
Camp, Ihe Sheriff's office was noti
fied today.
William R. Shadburne, star end
for the Santa Clara football team
in 190G and 1907, was the central
figure in the exchange of bullets,
killing Oscar Zimmerman, one of
the suspected swindlers, and him
self being wounded in the left
shoulder and wrist by a deputy
constable, who mistook the fracas
for a holdup.
Charges Swindle
Shadburne is a son of the late
George Shadburne, a famous San
Francisco attorney of a generation
ago.
Suspecting he had been duped by
five men and a woman, Shadburne
started out from his general store
in Seiad valley Wednesday night to
trail the band and get the evidence
on them.
He started on his hunt after three
strangers had won $50 on a punch
board, which had been placed in his
store only a few hours before by the
two other men and a woman.
Suspcctcd Plot
The winning was made so easily
that Shadburne said he was con
vinced the men accompanying the
woman were the "advance agents"
and three other men were the
"slickers."
He overtook the three men in
Henry Warner's drug store, where
they had just won on the punch
board. Leveling his gun, he held
them covered with their hands up
while he sent for Constable Frank
Murree.
As he waited for the Constable,
Shadburne tossed the handcuffs he
carried as deputy sheriff to Warner
and had Zimmerman handcuffed.
Shot by Campbell
When Murree, followed by his
deputy, Sam Howard, entered the
store, Shadburne whirled with his
drawn gun, suspicious of pals com
ing to aid the men he was holding
prisoner. Deputy Howard whipped
out his gun. Shadburne and the by
standers shouted a warning, but
Howard, being hard of hearing, did
not understand, and blazed away.
The deputy said afterward he
thought a holdup was under way..
As Shadburne fell, Zimmerman,
handcuffed to Warner, made a dash
for freedom. Lying on the floor,
bleeding from his wounds, Shad
burne fired three times. Zimmerman
fell dead..
