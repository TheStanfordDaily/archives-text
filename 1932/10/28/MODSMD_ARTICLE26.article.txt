# Warner Leaves For South With 34 Grid Players
## U.C.L.A. Expected to Feature Passes, Open Field Sprints; Card Backfield Has Anderson, Sim, Caddel, Hillman; Bruin Line Lighter 
### BOB WADE 
DREAKING his usual pre-game custom of naming a probable starting
lineup, and tending strictly to the business of perfecting a defense
against U.C.L.A.'s pass attack and the open Held sprinting of Bobby
Decker and ''Pants" Livesay, Coach Pop Warner sent his men through
their last strenuous workout before their departure tonight.
The Old Fox had his new backfield of Anderson, Caddel, Sim, ami
Hillman working in almost perfect unison, and the Grays were able
get very little yardage either from open plays or the expected pass attack.

The addition of Anderson hai
] given added precision and distance
i both to the Redshirt air raids, and
I to their punting, which will mean a
I great deal with a punter like Decker
j opposing them. The Bruin half kept

the ball well placed and far from
his own side of the field when the
Webfeet were beaten two weeks
ago, and Stanford doesn't figure to
take the same lesson thai was
handed out to the Oregon boys.
Frankovitch U.C.L.A. Favorite
The U.C.L.A. squad has been
priming for Stanford ever since the
Oregon victory, a full two weeks,
with only a slight interruption
caused by the workout against Cal-
Tcch last Saturday. They are count
ing on their sophomore phenom,
Mike Frankovitch, to come through
with another such last-minute in
spiration as won the battle at Eu
gene, and there is even a rumor to
the effect that the veteran Lenny
Bergdahl will be in the lineup a<
some time during the game, chipped
elbow and all.
I If "Joltin' Joe" Keeble is as badly
i injured as it has been reported,
I there will be a new face in the
Bruin backfield, with a correspond
ing chance that the power will be
greatly reduced, for Keeble was way
ahead of anything else that the
squad has been able to produce.
Bruins To Feature Passes
i With their line showing less
j weight than the Stanford forwards,
and two of their experienced backs
on the injured list, there is little
doubt about the kind of attack that
the Bruins will have to launch.
Their main hope is to get a pass
either over the Stanford secondary
or out to the side where their classy
I open-field runners will have a
! chance at the goal stripe.
Warner will leave tonight, after
a short signal drill in the afternoon,
with a squad of 34 men, which in

Frankovitch U.C.L.A. Favorite
The U.C.L.A. squad has been
priming for Stanford ever since the
Oregon victory, a full two weeks,
with only a slight interruption
caused by the workout against Cal-
Tcch last Saturday. They are count
ing on their sophomore phenom,
Mike Frankovitch, to come through
with another such last-minute in
spiration as won the battle at Eu
gene, and there is even a rumor to
the effect that the veteran Lenny
Bergdahl will be in the lineup a<
some time during the game, chipped
elbow and all.
I If "Joltin' Joe" Keeble is as badly
i injured as it has been reported,
I there will be a new face in the
Bruin backfield, with a correspond
ing chance that the power will be
greatly reduced, for Keeble was way
ahead of anything else that the
squad has been able to produce.
Bruins To Feature Passes
i With their line showing less
j weight than the Stanford forwards,
and two of their experienced backs
on the injured list, there is little
doubt about the kind of attack that
the Bruins will have to launch.
Their main hope is to get a pass
either over the Stanford secondary
or out to the side where their classy
I open-field runners will have a
! chance at the goal stripe.
Warner will leave tonight, after
a short signal drill in the afternoon,
with a squad of 34 men, which in

DREAKING his usual pre-game custom of naming a probable starting
lineup, and tending strictly to the business of perfecting a defense
against U.C.L.A.'s pass attack and the open Held sprinting of Bobby
Decker and ''Pants" Livesay, Coach Pop Warner sent his men through
their last strenuous workout before their departure tonight.
The Old Fox had his new backfield of Anderson, Caddel, Sim, ami
Hillman working in almost perfect unison, and the Grays were able
get very little yardage either from open plays or the expected pass attack.
