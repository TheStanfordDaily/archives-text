# FATAL CARELESSNESS!
## 
### 
The announci'inent of the death of Harry Lawlor, Saint
Mary's freshman, whose spine was fatally injured while
playing in an inlerclass football game, vividly illustrates
the need of proper judgment and supervision in all intra
mural sports. The authorities at Saint Mary's were guilty
of weak reasoning in allowing regular tackle football to be
played in any such informal contests as interclass games.
Without sufficient officiating, without proper equip
ment, regular football becomes dynamite in tfie hands of
inexperienced players. However, letting a few experi
enced men play in such a contest is like lighting tfie fuse
to the explosive! Lawlor, who was classed as a high school
"football star,"' undoubtedly was capable of a much harder
brand of playing than the rest of the members of the teams.
Where the rank beginner, who didn't take it too seriously,
might never get hurl under the inadequate, conditions, the
expert would be liable to injury because he would nat
urally be disinclined to "ease up."
With but few exceptions, football fatalities throughout
I fie years have developed, not from among varsity men,
but from the sand-lots and pick-up skirmishes. It seems a
shame that the real game of football should be discredited
bv a parasitic growth it abhors.
