Every year soon alter She Trojan trouncing, fraternities
on this campus turn thoughts to initiation of pledged, lie
fore the formal ceremonies comes a period commonly
known as Hell Week, a vestige of Ihe old blood and
thunder sessions of prc-initiatory physical torture.
The theory behind Hell Week was never intrinsically
bad, it being to incorporate a bit of good clean fun with a
genuine test of a man's ability to "take it." But when ac
tivities degenerated into smutty seances and physical vio
lence that resulted in not a few deaths, the real purpose of
Ihe period was lost.
With the objectionable features generally rooted out,
the Hell Week of today accomplishes its object to the satis
faction of all. A harmless bit of paddling, an equally
harmless bit of mental anguish, constitute for Ihe initiates
an experience that will always stay with them, one that will
be looked back upon not with regret, but with genuine en
joyment. And Ihe fun for (lie upperclassmen is obvious!
There is only one caution that might he in order. Now
that Hell Week is restored to a sane basis, let's exercise a
bit of care to prevent accidents that might result in injury.
