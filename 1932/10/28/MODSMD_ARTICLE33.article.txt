For a solid year it has been (here, staring lis in the facc
a big blue "C" daubed on tbc wall across from the
Graphic Arts building. When some childish person put it
there in the beat of his pre-13ig Game passion, in the fall of
the otlieial attitude toward the act was one of indif
ference the "we'll show 'em we are above such pettiness"
idea.
While that is a commendable spirit, it would seem that
the authorities have leaned slightly backward in their at
tempt to stand straight and aloof. After all, University
property was defaced, and the fact that it was done by an
unknown California supporter is not reason enough for
leaving it that way.
It would be the work of but a few minutes for a man to
paint over the blue and repair the damage. Certainly we
hove proved our immutable superiority to the silly perpe
trator. Now let us get rid of this "brand" at least before
our trek to Berkeley.
