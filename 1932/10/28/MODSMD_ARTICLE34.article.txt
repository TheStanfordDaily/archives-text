# BULL SESSION
## BALONEYS IN THE BREEZE 
### 
Ballyhoo, bunk, and bluff have {
become the great American pass
words to the highly tinseled thrones |
of popular success. It is admitted by |
everyone that if a person uses!
enough bluff in handing the people ,
sufficient bunk and the procedure i.s
publicized with ample ballyhoo—
victory is assured. That "B" forma
tion has captured the public imagi
nation with unbelievable certainty, j
And the present national campaign
proves it il' any proof is necessary.
It is only natural, therefore, that
when this depression struck the J
country, the old formula was thick
ly spread over the editorial pages j
of the land. It was everywhere felt !
that if the fighting American fron- !
tier spirit was aroused, this tern- j
porary setback could never stop the
irresistible advance of American I
progress. The years of panic have j
pretty nearly convinced everyone— \
except a few political hacks of the j
most broken-down variety — that j
permanent improvement will take
brains and courage of the highest i
caliber.
But even now, some reputed
brain-blizzards persist in putting;
the schnozzle out and waving the
baloney in the breeze by seriously '
proclaiming some obvious asininity j
or the other—to the evident delight |
of the Menchenites and the Com- ,
munists. The latest addition is of
fered by Tire & Rubber Mogul Har
very Firestone. Says the Akron 1
Tycoon: "If the people would stop !
grumbling and get back to work, j
we'd all be a lot better off."
Evidently, he still is under the'

| erroneous impression that the peo
' pie can live by baloney alone; and
therefore out of the bigness of his
J heart wishes to do something to
ward relieving their suffering. Bread
, may be dull; but is somewhat quite
necessary. What will the man who
has been unemployed for weeks
think of that statement? Of course,
lit may have been a misprint and
j maybe what Firestone really meant
to say was: "If the people could get
1 back to work, there would be less
| grumbling, and we'd alt be a lot

But Firestone isn't alone. The ba
| loney is thick about us—polluting
! the air we breathe—contaminating
| everything, and leaving a greasy
j garlic trail in its wake. The worming
baloney has even found its way to
I the Stanford Campus! At the Book

sion terrible?" How could anyone
J be so naive?
