THE MAN AT THE CARLTON (Ed- '
gar Wallace) Doubleday Doran:
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
(Earl Derr Riggers) Bobbs Mer- !
rill; THE MURDER TREE (Los
lie MacFarlane) E. P. Dutton. (At
the Oordon Strawbridge Library!
and the Palo Alto Book Shop.)
Heralded .since the days of the j
first five-foot bookshelf as relaxa- j
lion for college professors, mystery j
tales — necessarily limited — have
failed to progress since. They have
sought new locales and introduced
all sorts of scientific and pseudo- |
scientific amateur sleuth protagon- j
ists. But, like the average Western '
pictures, they have a certain easy I
power of amusing still.
Wallace's books still appear and
in this one clues are left carelessly
about and coincidence stretched in
fernally. It is a negligible effort.
Upon finishing "The Keeper of the
Keys" the reader will probably feel
annoyed and bilked; for Biggers for
gets his murderer until the final
chapter, not even utilizing false ;
clues fairly. It is an annoying vol- [
ume. The locale is Lake Tahoe—no j
consolation.
Of the three tales listed above
"The Murder Tree" is the best. It is
not particularly ingenious but moves
along rapidly and logically. The
slaughter is terrific but if one is ;
used to Dashiell Hammett's massa- j
cres will be easy to take.
In no one of the volumes is any- j
thing which will make history, j
nothing to jeopardize the reputa-1
lions of Sherlock Holmes and his j
more famous colleagues. But, bar- !

J ring the final dissatisfaction in the
! Biggers volume, all are easy enough
J reading. —Sandoe
LORENZO IN TAOS. By Mabel
Dodge Luhan. Alfred A. Knopf,
j 19:82. (At. of all places, the
I Stanford Library.)
This book is noteworthy for two
| things. It pictures D. H. Lawrence
j as a ridiculous nincompoop and it
; betrays its author is a thoroughly
uncomfortable, antagonistic woman.
"Lorenzo in Taos" is supposed to
| be a portrait of Lawrence, but in
| stead it becomes the annoyed rav
i ing of Mabel Dodge Luhan against
| a celebrity who frankly didn't like
her. One cannot help feeling that
it is revengeful in tone, exaggerated,
purposely unflattering.
Mrs. Luhan garrulously sets all
this down. Sometimes her writing
of it is quite vivid, particularly in
the accounts of some of the Taos
parties; but too often it is immature
; and repetitious. She is always in
| tensely conscious of her own part in
j the proceedings, so that we read
i pages and pages of the intimate re
actions of her own expansive ego.
Her descriptions of attempts to
reach Lawrence's psychical anten
nae through his physical body are
hilarious. During the course of the
; narrative several of her poems ap
| pear—shoddy banalities written to
. impress him.
Mabel Luhan addresses her book
j to Robinson Jeffers throughout, as-
I suring him that he would have liked
j Lawrence. Jeffers has admitted to
! me that after reading "Lorenzo in

Taos" he is not so sure that he j
would hay 3, The only reassuring 1
portion of it about Lawrence is the ,
i group of letters which forms the i
! first part of the book, replies to I
i Mabel's insistent invitations to come'
| to Taos.
It is all rather sad and rather i
, ridiculous. Mrs. Jeffers once told |
! me, "Mabel is a nice person, but so
j hopelessly belligerent." Lawrence, ;
thankfully, will outlive such femi
| nine hysteria. —Brughton
