HAVING SPENT SOMETHING
LIKE HALF the season battling
lines that outweighed them any
where from two to twenty
pounds, Stanford forwards have
finally picked on a team that
actually averages less than they
do.
From end to end, the Bruin line
averages slightly more than 185
pounds, while Stanford's starting
forward wall weighs in just under
187!
The Indian tackles and guards
outweigh their Bruin rivals, while
the home center and guard have |
the edge on the other Redshirt line
men.
Captain Homer Oliver, at 197
pounds, will have ten pounds on i
Mar Albertson, and over twenty on
Bill Bates.
So far this season, Stanford's ends j
have been able to help the tackles !
out, and sometimes even the guards,
but with the weight assignments in !
their favor, they can all attend to i
their own job without having to
worry about the fellow next to
them. As far as the center position
goes, although Homer Oliver is one
of the Bruin veterans, Stanford's
centers have been taking very good
care of themselves so far this sea
son, and with the vest of the line
having more chance to carry out its
assignments, all of the pivot men
should enjoy the afternoon's festivi
ties much more than they have in
Ihe past.
THE IDEA OF ALL THIS
preamble having been craftily
hidden so far, we can now bring
our weekly idea into the open
for some sunshine.
We think that our line is
about to bring us victory just i
the same way S.C.'s took home
the bacon last week-end.
Stanford rolled up the score
against Oregon because their
line couldn't keep up with the i
ball. Stanford scored against
Santa Clara because, among
other things, Stanford's line
made the afternoon hotter than
the Broncs like the weather.
As long as the line can stand
up under its opponent's charge, i
there is nothing wrong with
Pop's attack, but when a heavier
line plays close, charges fast,
and pushes the Indian line back,
it makes the attack look all
mixed up.
Well, for that matter yours i
would too!!!
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALI- !
FORNIA at Los Angeles has beaten (
the California Aggies (26-0), the |
University of Idaho (6-0), Oregon |
(12-7), and Cal-Tech (51-0). That:
schedule hasn't proved them a great |
team by any means, and the fact j
that they beat Oregon, with the help
of a fatal mistake on the part of a j
sophomore Webfoot, doesn't prove 1
it eithex*.
True, the Bruins made a fine |
stand against Stanford last year, but
this year's Stanford team, Troy not
withstanding, is a vastly improved |
outfit over last season's Big Red;
Machine.
The Bruins are counting on
their sophomores for scoring
power, and their Spaulding
training for defense, but they i
will have to possess more than
that to beat Stanford tomorrow.
