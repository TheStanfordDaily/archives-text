# Stanford Frosh Meet Trobabes Here Tomorrow
## INDIAN YEARLINGS HAVE SLIGHT EDGE ON EVE OF GAME Trojans Have Power Which May Be Enough To Upset Favorites 
### Dick Strouse 
When the Indian freshmen from
the Stanford Farm meet the Trojan
freshmen from Southern California
! tomorrow diternoon at 2 o'clock, two
football teams of equal material
| strength will face each other in the
Stanford Stadium. Scores of games
to date notwithstanding, John Bunn,
; who has seen the Trobabes play
j twice, announces that they have a
squad of potential strength.
At the start of the year, the U.S.C.
yearlings were coached by former
Trojan stars, Williamson, Mallory,
i and Shaver. After being well-drilled
!in fundamentals, this team was
' taken over by Sam Barry—basket
: ball coach of the gnashing teeth—
I and is just beginning, to get organ
| ized.
Card Material Improves
Stanford has a slight edge, be-
I cause for' the first time in several
seasons the Papooses are blessed
with material as good as that of the
1 other California schools. And this
j material has been molded into a
I co-ordinated, spirited football team.
But if U.S.C. clicks, the game may
j well become the best to date on
I Farm grid turf.
In preparation for the Trojan in
j vasion, Coaches Winterburn and
Bunn dummy-scrimmaged their
' first team against the Grays yester
! day, the latter helping out with the.
same plays used to "prepare" the
i varsity for the Trojans last week.
, The backs then attended a pep talk
i and chalk meeting similar to that
held for the linemen Wednesday
i night.
Regular Quartet
The strongest possible team will
start against Troy, with the regular
' backfield again playing together.
J This quartet includes Frank Alus
j tiza of the soaring punts, Bob Gray
!son of the slippery hips, powerful
' Bob Hamilton, and Earl Hoos, star
I blocker.
Monk Moscrip, who converts after
touchdowns with regularity, will
I open at right end with A1 Trompas
|at the other wing post. Gigantic
John Reynolds and consistent
' Claude Callaway will play tackle.
I Woody Adams and Laurie Rouble,
■ guards of excellence, will start, and
j Hero Bob Roth v/ill play center.
