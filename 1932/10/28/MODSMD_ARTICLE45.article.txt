# NATION'S MAJOR ELEVENS TO PLAY "BREATHER" CONTESTS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Football is in the doldrums to
morrow, the last Saturday in Octo
ber, as the nation's major elevens
rest up from last week's "Big
Games" and concentrate attention
on the important conlests scheduled
for November 5.
Gridiron interest will center on j
Pittsburgh's attempt to halt Notre |
Dame's high-scoring streak. The j
Ramblers have scored at will in j
their first four games of the season,
but will face a much tougher foe in
Pittsburgh's Panthers. Notre Dame's
opponents to date have been the
Notre Dame freshmen, Haskell In- J
dians, Drake University, and Car
negie Tech. Pittsburgh is undefeat
ed, but last week was held to a
scoreless tie by Ohio State, one of
the stronger Big Ten teams.
Two undefeated and untied teams i
clash in Soldiers' Field, Cambridge:
Harvard and Brown. The mythical
Atlantic Seaboard championship,
seldom a factor in determining na
tional honors* may hinge on the re
sult of the game. Columbia defends !
a perfect record against Cornell, j
tied by Princeton.
Fordham has scheduled Boston i
College as a "breather" between!
Michigan State and St. Mary's, Army j
expects to trample William and
Mary, Colgate anticipates little trou- !
ble from Penn State. Yale, yet to 1
win a game, will probably have to !
wait at least another Saturday. Eli's |
opponent this week-end is the Dart- j
mouth squad that nearly upset Har- j
vard.
Midwestern attention is focused |
on Big Ten games: Ohio State-Wis- j
consin and Chicago-Illinois. Other
Western Conference elevens step out
of league competition to take on in
tersectional rivals. Indiana expects

to swamp Mississippi Aggies, Michi
gan is a 4-1 favorite to defeat J
Princeton, Northwestern plays Mis- j
souri, and Purdue travels to New;
York University for the biggest in- j
tersectional game of the week-end. j
All is very quiet along the South- !
ern Conference front. Alabama plays j
Kentucky, Auburn (the latest title j
contender) plays Mississippi, Wallace i
Wade's Duke squad has the thank
less task of playing Tennessee. Van- ,
derbilt should have no trouble with j
Georgia Tech. Tulane is picked over ,
South Carolina in spite of her dis- i
couraging defeat at the hands of j
Auburn last week. Georgia- Florida;
is a tossup. I
Rice Institute steps out of South- 1
west Conference competition to I
tackle undefeated Creighton Uni
versity, and Texas' Longhorns play
Southern Methodist.
Though of little national interest,
the Stanford-U.C.L.A game is at- j
tracting much comment on the j
Pacific Coast, while California plays j
a "breather" against Nevada, and j
Southern California rests up entirely :
for her battle on the following Sat- j
urday against Berkeley's Golden j
Bears. Two Sunday games are im- >
portant: St. Mary's-Santa Clara and '
San Francisco-Loyola.
Aside from the Notre Dame-Pitts- j
burgh clash, this week's schedule |
may be properly considered as the j
low spot 'of the 1932 grid campaign, j

When Southern California played j
Loyola this year it was the first i
football game held between the two !
schools since 1909.
