# GERMANY OKEHS U. S. NAVY PLAN
## Arms Question Matter Of "To Be Or Not To Be" 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 27 (/P)
I Hoover's assertion last night that
the United States government would
! build up her fleet to full strength
I if the present disarmament nego-
I tiations should fail has found warm
j approval in official circles here.
"The President's strong words
cannot but forcibly remind those
nations which are disinclined to dis
arm of their promise given when the
Versailles treaty was signed," said
spokesman for the foreign office.
Views Held Alike
"Mr. Hoover's action is in direct
line with Germany's present policy
of aloofness from the Geneva con
ference. Our aloofness doesn't mean
that we are disinterested in dis
armament. Quite the contrary. But
it too is a tactical measure for re
minding other nations of their duty.
"We hope that the President's
statement will result in a better
i understanding of our position.
"If, as ho intimates, the security
of American trade is threatened by
the military policies of other na
tions despite America's favorable
geographical position, how much
more reason has Germany, with her
open frontiers and surrounded as
she is by strongly armed nations,
to be concerned about her security.
Matter Of Security
j "With us disarmament, or at least
arms equality, is not only a ques-
I tion of protecting our trade but a
I matter of 'to be or not to be.'
"We welcome Mr. Hoover's words
jas a clear indication of America's
[ insistence upon action in the dis
j armament negotiations, but we also
j see in it justification for our in-
I sistence upon equality for Ger
| many."
