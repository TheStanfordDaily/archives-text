# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM READY FOR SAN JOSE BATTLE
## 
### 
Still smarting from that defeat at
the hands of S.F.U., a Stanford soc
cer team, eager to stage a comeback
as the defending conference cham
pions should, lay in wait today for
the San Jose State squad which in
vades the campus tomorrow morn
ing to battle the Indians for the
second time this season.
Following u week which saw
radical experimental changes being
made in the first-string line-up, the
squad today remained much as it
was last week for the S.F.U. game.
Coach Maloney feels that it is the
best combination that he has had
to date.
Washburn Outside Right
In all probability, Laurie Wash
burn, who played at center hall
against the Dons, will see consider
able playing time at outside right
tomorrow, along with Sven Doding
ton.
Removal of Washburn from the
backfield left the halfback situation
in somewhat of a turmoil, but this
has been well remedied with the use
of Doug Kennedy in Washburn's old
place, and Alex Spohr and VVaddy
White in the other halfback berths.
Forward Line Shift
Alterations in the center of (he
forward line shift Cy Johnson to
inside left, and leave Gas Kojas and
Charlie Emerick to alternate at the
inside right position. Art Hearn
maintains his spot at center forward
as does Carl Knecht at outside left.
Captain Erwin Brekclbaum is one
of the mainstays at fullback, with
Bill Krumbein, very much im
proved, a dependable man for the
other side of the goal. Nil' Branch
will probably see some action in
Krumbein's place during the game.
Milt Newman is the likely starter
in the goal, but Jack King may
play.
The game starts at 11 o'clock.
