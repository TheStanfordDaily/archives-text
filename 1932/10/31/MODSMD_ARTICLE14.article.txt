## 
### BY ROLPH MALLOCH 
At the threshold of manhood—at
the age of 21—Stanford faculty mem
bers were attending college and al
ready showing signs of leadership
and ability.
Dean Culver at the age of 21 was
| a sophomore here, and was inter
i ested in zoology. As an outstanding
i student in this department, he was
i invited by Dr. Jordan on a fish-study
I tour of Mexico.
At 21 Comptroller Alnion E. Roth
| was a Stanford junior. His forte was
j running, and the varsity relay team.
! of which he was the stellar member,
j held the record for a number of
I years.
Professor James G. Emerson, de
| bating coach, was a sophomore at
I lowa State College at the age of 21.
I His biggest problem was deciding
i whether to take up law or journal
' ism as a life work.
i President Wilbur was already
showing his remarkable executive
ability. At 21 he held the position
' of senior class president and at the

I same time was an assistant in the
! department of physiology. He was a
| pz-e-med student.
j Professor Treat of the History De
| partment was already studying law,
jin the New York Law School. A
| friend persuaded him to teach his
: tory for one term, and he has been
j doing it ever since.
Professor Foster of the Classical
j Literature Department was a Stan
j ford sophomore during his twenty-
I first year, and was a library assist
j ant.
Occupying the important position
! of secretary to the Dean of Men,
j while a 21-year-old junior at the
j University of Missouri did not pre
' vent Buford O. Brown from learning
enough journalism to become assist-
J ant professor of that subject at Stan-
I ford.
Professor Hulmc was just entering
| the Stanford freshman class at the
I age of 21. He was a special student,
j as he had no high school credits,
; having left school in the seventh
grade to earn his own living.
