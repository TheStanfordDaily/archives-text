# U. C. APPOINTS DEBATE TEAM
## Masterson, Coburn, Breyer To Speak For Bears 
### 
Stanford's opponents in the politi
cal debate wit hthe University of
California have now been an
nounced. This contest, featuring the
masterful oratory of one Leßoy Co
burn, Jr., of the California team,
promises to be a hard-fought argu
ment. It is scheduled for Wednes
day night at 8 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall.
California's other two men are
junior students, both in their first
semester of varsity debate. One,
Donald A. Breyer, is treasurer of
the Democratic Club on his campus,
and a political science major. The
other is Salathiel Masterson, a pre
medical student who was very ac
tive in freshman debate across the
bay.
Gilchrist Aids U.C.
Stanford will not support Hoover's
administration in this debate. Nor
will she oppose him. Instead, Frank
lin Gilchrist of the Indian squad will
join with Breyer and Masterson of
California in attacking the Hoover
policies, while Ronald Kay and
Wayne Bannister will receive the
powerful assistance of Leßoy Co
burn of California in defending the
Republican stand.
Coburn, a senior in Public Speak
ing, is president of his local chapter
of Delta Sigma Rho, national de
bating honor society. He is also a
member of the Senate Debating So
ciety at California. Students who
three or four years ago attended
junior colleges of northern Califor
nia will remember Coburn as the
"big gun" of Santa Rosa Junior
College's debate team, and the ter
ror of junior college debaters. Since
then he has transferred, and is in
his third semester of debate at Cali
fornia.
Teams to Confer
The California team visited the
campus last week to confer with the
Stanford men regarding the outline
of their argument and the dividing
of their subject. This is the first
time in the memory of Stanford de
bate fans that opposing teams have
divided their forces between oppo
site sides of the question. This split
team principle was established for
political debates by a University
ruling recently.

On the same night that these men
clash, four other Indian teams will
be threshing out the same question
at four other colleges. Two men will
uphold Hoover in a triangular de
bate with St. Mary's and California,
at St. Mary's. This is the one ex
ception to the split-team principle.
Another team will journey to Berke
ley; a third will encounter the Uni
versity of San Francisco, and a
fourth will meet Fresno State Col
lege.

The California team visited the
campus last week to confer with the
Stanford men regarding the outline
of their argument and the dividing
of their subject. This is the first
time in the memory of Stanford de
bate fans that opposing teams have
divided their forces between oppo
site sides of the question. This split
team principle was established for
political debates by a University
ruling recently.

On the same night that these men
clash, four other Indian teams will
be threshing out the same question
at four other colleges. Two men will
uphold Hoover in a triangular de
bate with St. Mary's and California,
at St. Mary's. This is the one ex
ception to the split-team principle.
Another team will journey to Berke
ley; a third will encounter the Uni
versity of San Francisco, and a
fourth will meet Fresno State Col
lege.
Stanford's opponents in the politi
cal debate wit hthe University of
California have now been an
nounced. This contest, featuring the
masterful oratory of one Leßoy Co
burn, Jr., of the California team,
promises to be a hard-fought argu
ment. It is scheduled for Wednes
day night at 8 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall.
California's other two men are
junior students, both in their first
semester of varsity debate. One,
Donald A. Breyer, is treasurer of
the Democratic Club on his campus,
and a political science major. The
other is Salathiel Masterson, a pre
medical student who was very ac
tive in freshman debate across the
bay.
Gilchrist Aids U.C.
Stanford will not support Hoover's
administration in this debate. Nor
will she oppose him. Instead, Frank
lin Gilchrist of the Indian squad will
join with Breyer and Masterson of
California in attacking the Hoover
policies, while Ronald Kay and
Wayne Bannister will receive the
powerful assistance of Leßoy Co
burn of California in defending the
Republican stand.
Coburn, a senior in Public Speak
ing, is president of his local chapter
of Delta Sigma Rho, national de
bating honor society. He is also a
member of the Senate Debating So
ciety at California. Students who
three or four years ago attended
junior colleges of northern Califor
nia will remember Coburn as the
"big gun" of Santa Rosa Junior
College's debate team, and the ter
ror of junior college debaters. Since
then he has transferred, and is in
his third semester of debate at Cali
fornia.
