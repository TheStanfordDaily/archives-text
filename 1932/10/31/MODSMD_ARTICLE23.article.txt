# BLOCKED PUNTS DEFEAT INDIAN GRIDMEN 13-6
## Anderson Rushed By Bruin Forwards As Card Line Fails To Hold DOUB SHINES AT END Stanford Suffers Letdown From Trojan Game 
### Bob Letts 
Back on the Farm after dropping
a 13-6 decision to a strong defensive
team representing University of
California at Los Angeles Saturday
down south. Coach Glenn Scobey
Warner and his Stanford Indians pre
pared today to go into intensive
workouts for their third conference
game in as many weeks. The Card's
entertain Jimmy Phelan's University
of Washington eleven here next Sat
urday.
Suffering more than they realized
from the Southern California contest
here a week ago, Warner's men were
unable to produce quite enough zip
to withstand the great game dis
played by Coach Bill Spaulding's
Bruins, and two momentary col
lapses of protection to Stan Ander
son on punts turned a widely-pre
dicted victory into Stanford's first
defeat by U.C.L.A.
Two Kicks Blocked
Anderson, who started at quarter
back and played a good game, had
been doing some fancy kicking all
afternoon, but his assistants failed
to let him get away two kicks that
were blocked and converted into
touchdowns.
The first came on the last play of
the second quarter, and was actually
made after the timer's gun had
sounded. Anderson was back in punt
formation with the ball on his 26-
yard line. Verdi Boyer, 175-pound.
Bruin guard, broke through and ran
down a clear alley to block the kick.
Bob McChesney, sophomore left end,
was right on Boyer's heels and fol
lowed the ball over the goal line to
score U.C.L.A.'s first touchdown and
tie the game at the half, 0-6.
Yearick Blocks One
Number two came in the last pe
riod, with Stanford in possession on
her own 43-yard marker. Anderson
again was back to kick, and this
time Clayton Yearick, another
sophomore of the South, crashed
through from his right tackle posi
tion and blocked the ball. The pig
skin took a long bounce toward the
goal line and was finally retrieved
on Stanford's eight-yard line by Del
bert McGue, Bruin left tackle.
Joe Keeble, injured Uclan star who
had been put in the game the previ
ous quarter, was called on, and he
made seven yards in two plays.
George Grey smeared him on the
third down, but left halfback Walt:
Clark wiggled over by inches on the
next play. Mike Frankovitch place
kicked the extra point.
Cards Score First
Stanford's score came in the first
period and apparently put the Cards
in command, only to have that "last
play-of-the-first-half" give the game
an entirely different aspect. Grey
kicked off and Stanford shortly
gained possession on Ucla's 33-yard
line when Bill Corbus tackled Live
say so hard that the Bruin fumbled.
Six plays later, the Cards had
scored, Bill Sim driving through left
tackle for the last 10 yards. Franko
vitch blocked Corbus' attempted
place kitk. That startling punch so
early in the game look some of the
starch out of the Westwood rooters,
and the crowd began to sit back with
the idea of seeing more or less of a
slaughter. The fact that Spaulding's
men did not let up is a credit to
them.
