# AN OPEN LETTER TO POP WARNER
## 
### 
( With (ipoloi/ies to Arthur Guitcrman)
When tli;il radio announcer told us loudly in his sneering,
Nasal voice the game was won, and we heard a mighty cheering
From an upstart Bruin's tongue, did you think we'd all go
bee ring,
All our sorrow lor to drown, and for Stanford's future
fearing?
Not at all, oh Mr. Warner. That would be a situation!—
Were the value of our dearly bought and treasured education
To be re-determined yearly in your brawny speculation
Willi football minds and muscle on the gridirons of the
nation.
Not that we on Stanford's campus wish to underestimate
Ihe game- no, that is not the ease—lor we must always
postulate
Our interest in the Conference race, and wish ourselves the
greatest gate
Receipts and football glory in our sporl history, to date.
Stanford should play twice each year, and those two games, you
will perceive,
Willi Trov and Cal. All oilier games, we really have begun to
believe,
Are only with collegiate names, at whieh we cannot still
conceive
To rise and cheer as Trojans do, nor as the rah-rah Bruins
grieve.
So do not think you've let us down, or that your loss we now
deplore,
For Stanford doesn't seem to care such a hell of a lot, any
more.
— Fritz Goodwill
