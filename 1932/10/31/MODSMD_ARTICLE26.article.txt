# AN ASININE RULING

### 
Freedom of the press is one of the fundamentals on
which modern society operates. College newspapers, be
cause I hoy are t lie voice of the undergraduate, are par
ticularly jealous of their freedom (roin (acuity interfer
ence. This sentiment is generally understood and re
spected.
Last year, when Reed Harris was relieved of liis posi
tion as editor of the (Columbia Speclulor by the authorities,
for reasons of very doubtful nature, the incident was con
sidered unusual and exceptional. However, a recent
decree by Dean Just in 11. Moore of C.C.N.Y/s School of
liusiness regarding the Ticker, a student news organ,
reopens the question with a sudden jolt.
In this instance, the dean ruled that every article that
appeared in the 'i'ickcr should lirst be authorized by a
faculty advisor. The editorial board very naturally re
fused to comply with this edict. As a result all publication
was suspended.
The gross injustice of this order is apparent, not only
to journalists, but to all impartial judges. The amount of
subserviency necessary to accept such a proposition would
be intolerable. There could be but one mode of action
left to the members of this newspaper.
The faculty of C.C.N.Y. may be rightly accused of hypo
crisy. What a strange mixture of principles to preach
freedom of ideas within the classrooms and then to turn
about within the very walls of the college and impose a
strict censorship on a student publication.
The Columbia incident was taken as unusual; this sec
ond encroachment should certainly be looked on with
alarm; while a third situation of this nature, should it
arise, would be a declaration of war. It, is indeed a reflec
tion on a college or a university if the authorities, that be,
do not have confidence in their undergraduate editors. It
is more of a reflection 011 the authorities if they imagined
that a censorship could ever be tolerated.
