## 
### 
An outing which almost ended in
a forest fire, had it not been for the
timely presence of the scouts on the
scene, was the result of a picnic
given yesterday by Alpha Phi
Omega, honorary scouting fraternity.
Approximately 30 men, accom
panied by Professors Lenz and C. N.

The party was approaching the
picnic grounds when they were
pressed into service at a place where
a four-acre fire was slowly spread
ing beyond control of a fire engine

of fighting, the workers succeeded in
beating a path around the blaze, and
the fire burned out.
