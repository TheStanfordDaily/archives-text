# BULL SESSION
## WITHOUT "COMBS" 
### 
I A show always looks different
! from paid seats. The amateur re-
I viewer is especially prone to the
pleasing swelling of the ego which
always accompanies complimentary
tickets. This expanding of the per
sonality can manifest itself in two
days.
First, by a flaming desire to be !
I the play-hardened New York cynic !
I —tear the show to bitter bits by ;
! scathing generalities and pugnacious j
! puns. Second, and more common, is i
| to pour forth mellifluous praise of j
| saccharine sweetness to insure a fu- !
! ture supply of free tickets.
During a brief lifetime, we have j
! received free theatre ducats exactly j
i twice. Both times we were afraid j
Ito indulge in any reviewing. But |
I when we lay foi'th coin-of-the- |
realm our reviewing instinct swells j
! forth in unmitigated glory. Such is i
| the situation with "Death Takes A i
i Holiday"—Friday's performance in |
| that cathedi'al of lavish luxury, !
I "Stanford Assembly Hall."
• ■
The play increased my estimation ;
|of Director Helvenston. To choose |
| such a play knowing what this j
I Campus doesn't offer in dramatic j
j ability indicated courage. To put the !
! play on in the manner he did with j
| the talen he didn't have showed I
j ability. With powei'ful lines all :
I about infinity, love, death—and gen- j
| eral stuff about which no one has \
j very definite ideas but which mas- i
ters can write thrilling blurb liter- j
ally splattered about, with some'
startling stage effects, and with
Gantner in the lead—the perform
ance was little short of a campus

hit.
!
It was up to Bull Session's Dra- j
matic Pet No. 1 to make or ruin the j
show, and Vallejo Gantner was i
splendid. His dignity, sonority, and !
poise kept the difficult part from ;
becoming the Horner's Corners type ;
j of tragedian role — so common on I
i collegiate stages. Some felt that j
| Gantner showed too much reserve in j
■the love scenes, and not enough of 1
j the rumble seat hero with the Don j
i Juan trimmings. It must be remem- !
| bered that Gantner was playing j
! Death on a holiday and not Death!
I transformed into a thrilling high- !
j pressure lover for the benefit of the j
! three co-eds in the rococco gowns.
I With the exception of Barbara i
I Collins, the female parts were not
| too fancy. Virginia Wilson had a I
j trying role. She was supposed to be j
i a spiritual wisp—a breath of the j
i gods—a philosophical incarnate in j
| woman's form. But while she tried
: hard, she was always just Virginia '
| Wilson —Kappa house, second floor. |
| She walked falteringly enough, was ;
j pale enough—but never struck any j
| spiritual chords in me, at least,
i There's a difference between spiri
| tuality and fraility, and that differ
! ence was never noted.
Stover and Wolf were both good, i
! Wolf will probably see more action i
j later in the season. They were two j
' gallants in the play with no more j
! than the color of their hair to dis- j
' tinguish them; but I suppose all gal- j
lants are more or less alike.
