DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY—At
Stanford Assembly Hall.
Harold Helvenston produced the
too-allegorical "Death Takes A
Holiday" with curious results last
Friday evening. For two acts the
play seemed not to justify itself; in
the third it connected.
The sentimental mysteriousness of
the play demands all the suave re
sources of expert players; an un
ripe cast almost necessarily fails in
the moments of emotional excite
ment because inexperience leads to
that slight exaggeration which,
rather than building climaxes, top
ples them into the ludicrously melo
dramatic.
In his first scene Vallejo Gantner,
playing humorlessly and over-in
tensely, was unsatisfactory; as Sirki
he was indifferent; but in the third
act, aided by a cast which had
found itself, he built excellently to
a striking climax.
Mary Anita Loos was the best of
the new material; sometimes un
easy, she overcame the handicap of
intexperience in her fullest scene,
played sincerely an dwell. She was
outstanding among the women.
Barbara Collins spoiled her second
| act climax by a single melodramatic
| gesture; in the third she made no
, such error and proved herself a
j capable actress. Frederick Stover,
i playing the Baron for comedy in his
i first acts and winning applause for
! work well done, played for pathos
! in a third act bit and rose above
| applause on his exit.
Joseph Wolf, barring a few sharp-
Ily drawn breaths, was good in a
| difficult role. Virginia Wilson was
; satisfactory but not outstanding in
! a. part which demanded that she be
| romantically melancholy and ethe
! real. George Leavens and Joseph
Lawry did little with colorless roles.
While the tempo was rapid enough
; the play did not build before the
| third act; either Gantner or Helven
-1 ston failed to utilize the dry humor
:in Death's first long scene and
i played it hysterically. The scene is
I vilely written, Death's soliloquies
| continuing unnecessarily for pages;
j but it would have been improved if
| the wry jests had been emphasized
I rather than submerged.
Helvenston was courageous and
i somewhat rash in producing the
J play with so much new material,
j particularly after the success
j of the exquisitely produced Berke
| ley Square. The production was not
:as consistently good as others but
j had, at least, one act better than
! most. —Sandoe

Stanford Assembly Hall.
Harold Helvenston produced the
too-allegorical "Death Takes A
Holiday" with curious results last
Friday evening. For two acts the
play seemed not to justify itself; in
the third it connected.
The sentimental mysteriousness of
the play demands all the suave re
sources of expert players; an un
ripe cast almost necessarily fails in
the moments of emotional excite
ment because inexperience leads to
that slight exaggeration which,
rather than building climaxes, top
ples them into the ludicrously melo
dramatic.
In his first scene Vallejo Gantner,
playing humorlessly and over-in
tensely, was unsatisfactory; as Sirki
he was indifferent; but in the third
act, aided by a cast which had
found itself, he built excellently to
a striking climax.
Mary Anita Loos was the best of
the new material; sometimes un
easy, she overcame the handicap of
intexperience in her fullest scene,
played sincerely an dwell. She was
outstanding among the women.
Barbara Collins spoiled her second
| act climax by a single melodramatic
| gesture; in the third she made no
, such error and proved herself a
j capable actress. Frederick Stover,
i playing the Baron for comedy in his
i first acts and winning applause for
! work well done, played for pathos
! in a third act bit and rose above
| applause on his exit.
Joseph Wolf, barring a few sharp-
Ily drawn breaths, was good in a
| difficult role. Virginia Wilson was
; satisfactory but not outstanding in
! a. part which demanded that she be
| romantically melancholy and ethe
! real. George Leavens and Joseph
Lawry did little with colorless roles.
While the tempo was rapid enough
; the play did not build before the
| third act; either Gantner or Helven
-1 ston failed to utilize the dry humor
:in Death's first long scene and
i played it hysterically. The scene is
I vilely written, Death's soliloquies
| continuing unnecessarily for pages;
j but it would have been improved if
| the wry jests had been emphasized
I rather than submerged.
Helvenston was courageous and
i somewhat rash in producing the
J play with so much new material,
j particularly after the success
j of the exquisitely produced Berke
| ley Square. The production was not
:as consistently good as others but
j had, at least, one act better than
! most. —Sandoe
