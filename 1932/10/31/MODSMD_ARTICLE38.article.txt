By Dick Strouse

The faith inspired by continued
peful readings of Ripley's "Believe
Or Not" cartoons, and the proof
spired by a veracious scoreboard
mbined to convince a skeptical
mpus Saturday afternoon that
anford University actually beat
e University of Southern Califor
a in a game of football.
Of course, it was a freshman
me and of course, U.S.C. was
;akened by the loss of seven out
eleven regulars because of last
inute ineligibility, but still the ir
futable, magnificent, and incred
le fact remains that Stanford was
e winner and Troy the loser.
The Indian freshmen not only
at U.S.C., but were unconven
>nal enough to beat U.S.C, badly,
le final score was 33 to G, and it
is fairly indicative of the Cardinal
premacy Saturday.
Grayson Flashes
Until he was injured, Bob Gray
-11 was nearly a one-man football
am. He made the first touchdown
issible by tearing around S.C.'s
ft end to the seven-yard line from
5" formation. Acting-Captain Bob
imilton went over on a reverse.
Dashing around ends, sliding off
ckles, squirming back with punts, j
rayson's efforts again led to a j
ore when he threw a 25-yard pass
Alex Trompas, outstanding end i
ho made a "Colvin catch" over the j
ial-line. Monk Moscrip converted |
at time, and Stanford was 13 ,
lints ahead of a U.S.C. team.
7 Points in 3 Piays
Three more plays, and the score
is 20 to 0. Swede Carlson kicked
f for Stanford, S.C. fumbled on its
st play Busy Bob Hamilton
covered, and then Grayson scored
i a 28-yard sprint. Moscrip made i
e third of the three plays by con
•rting again.
Frank Alustiza, whose beautiful
lick-kicks helped him to maintain j
56-yard punting average during
e afternoon, had a share in the j
■xt touchdown. He threw a long
iss to Hamilton, the play being !
>od for 49 yards. Carlson had the
ensure of booting the ball be- i
'een the uprights that time.
Rouble Stars in Line
Throughout the game, Hamilton i
ockcd and tackled as no Stanford |

back has blocked and tackled for
years. Hamilton, Hoos, Adams, and
Rouble teamed up in various com
binations to lead the plays on which
Grayson and Bronstein looked so
good. Rouble also spent a good part
of the afternoon in S.C.'s backfield,
removing the power from the Jones
power plays.
Shortly after the start of the third
quarter Ray Lewis threw a perfect
pass to both Hamilton and Moscrip,
but since neither wished to deprive
the other of a chance to score, the
ball fell between them. Oct Morgan
retaliated for that lone Trojan
touchdown by scoring after one of
Sheldon Bronstein's many sparkling
runs.
