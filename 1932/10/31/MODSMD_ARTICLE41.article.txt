SOMETHING IN TIIE NATUREi
of a shakeup will probably prevail,
Jin this week's Stanford gridiron j
i practices, if information heard last J
j night is true.
Coach Pop Warner, likely as not, |
i has a double motive —to give the j
boys who have done heavy work all !
season a rest, and to prevent them j
from going stale.
The Cards battle University of
i Washington this week, the third
successive Saturday of conference
competition; and Pop figures that
precaution must be the watchword. |

JIMMY PHELAN'S Huskies are
apt to be the pre-game favorites.
With Stanford as underdog, John D.
Dope may get another punch on the J
kisser. Old John has taken 'em from |
every angle this season. And that
brings up a brief survey of what's j
happened so far this year on the
i Coast:
California tied St. Mary's
Troy beat Stanford (not such an
upset).
Ucla beat Stanford (ditto).
Oregon beat Santa Clara.
Pitt beat Notre Dame.
Ucla beat Oregon.
California beat Washington.
S.F.U. took several on the pro- |
hoscis.

THE ELIGIBILITY RULE which
prevents anybody with less than 12
recommending units from playing'
in the University of Southern Cali- I
fornia-Stanford freshman football
game should not be overlooked. It
cost Coach Sam Barry seven men
here last Saturday, and made Stan
ford's chances in the future look
better than they really are.
It would have been interesting to
see what could have happened, were
it not for that rule. Then we might

j have some idea for the coming grid
iron generation.

| COMPARATIVE UNIMPORT
| ANCE of freshman contests makes
[.small write-ups of them imperative
in most papers. In case you weren't

I have heard about some of the
i "lesser lights" groomed by "Chuck"
j Winter burn:
Rouble, guard, loved the Trobabes
I a lot (i.e., wrapped his arms around
them).
Harry Carlson, tackle, sent sev
eral kickoffs clear to the end zone.
Acting Captain "Bones" Hamilton
and Frank Alustiza did some swell
blocking.
"Little Spud" Lewis passed well
but not too accurately. —B.L.
Swimming and hockey have risen
to unusual popularity in the decade
at Michigan.
