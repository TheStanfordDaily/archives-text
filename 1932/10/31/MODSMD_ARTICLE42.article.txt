# Babes Lose, 1-0 In Soccer Tilt
## 
### 
One of those doubtful, unconvinc
ing decisions made by an arbitrary
referee who did not know his rules
too well, cost the Stanford freshman (
soccer team a 1-0 decision at the '
hands of a South San Francisco j
high school squad which should j
have earned no more than a tie on
the local field last Saturday morning.
It was Goalie Laird, playing an
otherwise flawless and superb game,
whose error of taking too many
steps with the balT in his hands, was
over-penalized by the referee and ]
erroneously gave the high-school j
team a penalty kick which, when
converted into a score, won the |
game. ,
Ability of the team to hold South
San Francisco scoreless before and ■
after this penalty was largely due
to the exceptional play of the fresh
man fullbacks, Valentine and Hunts- j
berger. Failure of the team to score !
can be blamed on the loose, un
organized attack of the forwards.
