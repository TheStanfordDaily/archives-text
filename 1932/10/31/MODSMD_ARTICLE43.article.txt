One-sided scores in the intramural !
j touch football games seem to be in j
1 vogue. Curious enough is the fact I
that whenever a grid squad wins j
by 25 or more points the opponent \
j goes down in the dust scoreless, j
| This fact finds no exceptions this j
I season.
1 The newest addition to the list of !
1 these one-sided games came last I
j Friday in the regular mural game j
' schedule when the men from Phi 1
1 Kappa Psi put over a 33-0 victory j
i over the clubmen from Los Arcos. i
| In the other game of the day an!
j cxactly reverse situation existed, i
| Sigma Nu and Sigma Alpha Epsilon j
j battled to a 6-6 tie at the end of
1 (he regular game period, and then,
when the teams went into the extra
alternate play period, Sigma Nu
won an 8-6 victory.
Taking to the air in the first play j
I of the Phi Psi-Los Arcos game,'
j George Latimer of the Phi Psi's j
j a pass to Burnham Yates, ;
i good for 30 yards and a touchdown, j
j The pass for conversion failed. Cli- j
1 mixing a series of passes and runs, j
| Ike Hables from up the Row sprint- j
| ed for 10 yards to taally the Phi Psi's |
I second touchdown. A pass from |
! Hables to Yates was good for the '
' extra point. Hables went into action |
J ;igain, made an 11-yard run, and j
j scored the third touchdown.
In the Sigma Nu-S.A.E. game, the!

two teams made little headway un- ;
til the middle of the second half.
Then Bob Boggs of the SA.E. squad
intercepted a Sigma Nu pass on the !
opponent's 30-yard marker and ran j
to a touchdown. The pass for the:
extra point failed. On the last play '
of the game Bob Polhamus of Sigma,
Nu passed 25 yards to Roger Lewis;
; behind the SA.E. goal to tie the |
score. Lewis, on a 15-yard run in!
the extra alternate period, pushed!
the ball deep into S.A.E. territory j
!to score the winning two points. I
