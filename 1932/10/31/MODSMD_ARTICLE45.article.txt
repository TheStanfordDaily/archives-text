# CARD SOCCER MEN WIN HARD BATTLE FROM TEACHERS, 2-1
## Stanford Scores Deciding Point In Last Minute Rally; Second Win 
### Maurice Rapf 
A Stanford varsity soccer team,
apparently safely ahead with a 1-0
lead over San Jose State, lost its
grip a few minutes before the end
of the game, allowed San Jose to
score and even the count, only to
wake up a minute later and drive
the ball into the net to win the
game 2-1.
So reads the scoring outline of
last Saturday's game on Stanford's
lield, a game which saw the Indians
register their second victory of the
season, both of which were at the
expense of the Teachers and both
by the same score.
Many Tries Fail
It does not tell, however, of the
many, almost innumerable times
that Coach Maloney's forwards v/ere
down close to the San Jose State
goal driving the ball at the oppos
ing goalie, who, with an almost un
believable mixture of luck and abil
ity, seemed to repel every effort. It
does not tell of the many limes that
the ball, kicked by Hearn, Johnson,
and other Stanford forwards, hit the
uprights and bounced back into the
lield of play.
1-0 At Half
The spectators who turned out for
the game were awed when the team
only had a 1-0 lead at half time, and
this score only as a result of a pen
alty kick given Art Hearn. It seemed
merely a matter of time until some
of those frequent Stanford kicks at
the goal would score. If nothing else,
the law of averages demanded it.
But the second half found the
going much the same; the ball right,
down there in front of San Jose's
goal, but no scores. It wasn't until
the count was tied and the players
realized the real need of a score that
one of those kicks scored. Cy John
son, inside left, was the man who
put the winning goal in the net.
Substitutions Frequent
Coach Maloney used his full limit
of substitutions, the only men play
ing the entire game being Goalie
Jack King, Captain Erwin Breckel
baum at fullback, Waddy White and
Doug Kennedy, halfbacks, Carl
Knecht, left wing, Art Hearn, center
forward, and Laurie Washburn, out
side right.
Bill Krumbein played well at full
back but gave way to Nil' Branch
who also performed capably. Alex
Spoehr had an off day and was re
placed in the last quarter by Dick
Strouse.
Changes in the forward wall were
frequent, with Cy Johnson, Sven
Dodington, Wataro Sutow, Charlie
Emcrick, and Gas Rojas all seeing
action.
