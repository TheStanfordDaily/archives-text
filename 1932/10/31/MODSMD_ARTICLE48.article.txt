# NOTRE DAME, HARVARD, DEFEATED IN SATURDAY'S GRIDIRON UPSETS
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
What promised to be a very mild j
football week-end pi'oduced the
greatesf gridiron upset of the 1932 i
campaign.
Notre Dame's point-a-minute '
team went down to 12-0 defeat I
when Pittsburgh's Panthers lashed
out twice with savage thrusts that j
garnered two touchdowns in sixty I
seconds of desperate football, just;
when it had appeared that the an- J
nual Rambler-Panther classic would |
wind up in a scoreless tie. The two j
Pittsburgh touchdowns came in;
quick succession shortly after the I
timer had announced that there J
were eight minutes of the game left J
to play.
There were few important games |
on the Pacilic Coast. In the only i
contest with any bearing on the;
Pacific Coast Conference champion- ;
ship, University of California at Los j
Angeles defeated Stanford 13-6. It j
was the first Bruin victory in the
history of gridiron competition be
tween the two schools.
Upsets Numerous
Upsets were numerous along the
Atlantic Seaboard. Favored to go
through the season with a perfect j
record, Harvard fell before another j
undefeated and untied team, Brown j
University. Brown still has three i
games on her schedule, and all three |
are against unbeaten and untied ]
elevens: Holy Cross, Columbia, and
Colgate.
Because it is a forty-eight-year
tradition that no Dartmouth team 1
can beat a Yale team, the Deep Blue !
won her first game of the season, j
Dartmouth's defeat was by a 6-0
score.
Pennsylvania, Columbia, Colgate, !

Holy Cross, and Purdue remained
undefeated after a set of five im
portant Eastern games. Columbia
had the hardest time keeping her
slate clear, the Lions defeating Cor
nell by a 6-0 score. Pennsylvania
whipped Navy, Colgate trampled
Penn State as expected, Holy Cross
defeated Catholic University, and
Purdue smothered New York Uni
versity in an intersectional game.
In the South, Tennessee, Auburn,
and Virginia Poly still lead the
parade. Tennessee had to resort to
a field goal to conquer Wallace
Wade's game Duke eleven by a 16-
13 score. Auburn used second
stringers in beating Mississippi, 14-
7, while Virginia Poly, more impres
sive with each week-end, trampled
Washington and Lee by a 32-7 score.
Texas Still Leads
Although University of Texas still
leads the Southwest Conference fol
lowing a victory over Southern
Methodist's Mustangs, Rice Institute,
defeated once, was more impressive
in swamping hitherto undefeated
Creighton University under a 41-7
deluge. Texas Christian advanced at
the expense of Baylor, Centenary
continued her remarkable string of
victories by whipping Texas Aggies.
Louisiana State, under the tutelage
of "Biff" Jones, looked very strong
in defeating Sewanee by a 38-0
count.
Saint Mary's handed Santa Clara
its annual "Big Game" beating. The
Broncs led 13-0 at half time, but
"Slip" Madigan's Moragans scored
fourteen points in the third quarter
with such suddenness that the life
was taken from Santa Clara's attack,
and the final score remained 14-13.
