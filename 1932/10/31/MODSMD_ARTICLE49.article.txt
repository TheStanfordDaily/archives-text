# Gaels Stage Comeback To Take Santa Clara
## 
### 
Staging a third-quarter comeback
i that was rivaled only by their last
! minute 1931 win, the Galloping |
j Gaels of Moraga Valley yesterday !
i afternoon took a hot football game ,
I from Santa Clara to the tune of i
i 14-13 while a full Kezar Stadium
I looked on.
| On the short end of a 13-0 score,
I the Gaels left the field at half time j
I a seemingly beaten team. But they J
i came back strong to show a bril- j
I liant offense and then a stalwart de
i fen.se. With a precarious one-point
lead, the Gael gridders took no'
j chances in the closing minutes of j
play and held the ball for all they j
| were worth until Referee Herb [
Dana was forced to call three five- j
| yard penalties for too much time [
j in the huddles.
With another victory under their :
belts the Gaels left San Francisco
| immediately after the game en route j
; to New York to tackle the Fordham I
Rams.
