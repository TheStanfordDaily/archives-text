# GANTNER STARS IN DEATH ROLE
## Feminine Honors Go To Barbara Collins 
### 
"I, Death, take on the world, the
flesh, and the devil!"
With these dramatic words, the
Grim Reaper laid aside his scythe
and his somber garments and donned
the mortal role of Prince Sirki of
Vitalba Alexandri in Harold Hel
venston's production of "Death
Takes A Holiday," given last Friday
night.
Harold Helvenston's interpretation
of Alberto Casella's imaginative
drama was marked by the same
beauty and concinnity which dis
tinguished last year's "Berkeley
Square." And Frederick Stover's
setting of the Italian castle was a
beautifully conceived and executed
affair which materially enhanced the
presentation.
Voice Shading Good
As the vacationing monarch, Val
lejo Gantner was a majestic and
compelling figure. Perhaps the out
standing thing about Gantner's in
terpretation of Death was his skill
ful shading of his voice, and that,
coupled with his perfect poise, en
abled him easily to dominate the
scenes in which he appeared. Gant
ner made Death dignified and com
manding, seriously in earnest in de
siring to understand mortals, and
yet with a quality of sardonic hu
mor.
Possibly the most difficult role in
the play was that assigned to Joseph
Wolf, who, despite an ill-fitting
dress-suit, gave an excellent inter
pretation of the Duke. It was a part
which demanded an immense
amount of- "entrained intensity, and
Wolf was thoroughly convincing.
Feminine acting honors went eas
ily to Barbara Collins, whose small
role of the Princess was through
sheer histrionic skill made into one
of the' finest performances seen by
this reviewer on the Stanford stage.
Stover Excellent
Frederick Stover injected much
comedy and not a little sympathy
into his role of the aging Baron.
Mary Anita Loos, her voice much
improved, left little to be desired
from her interpretation of Alda.
Her climactic moment with Gantner
in Act II was the dramatic highlight
of the evening, a gripping and
splendidly acted scene.
Wilson Fair
Virginia Wilson, hampered by ill
ness, was a lovely and appealing
Grazia, and yet not quite vital
enough.
Less satisfying was the work of
the minor members of the cast.
Mildred Ashworth and Jane Desen
berg lacked the poise to be thor
oughly convincing, and yet formed
beautiful parts of a beautiful en
semble. Joseph Lawry and George
Leavens were unimpressive in ju
venile roles, and Mildred King,
James Benet, and Lee Chapin were
adequate in small parts.
The impression left by "Death
Takes A Holiday" was that of a
well-rounded and sensitively han
dled production, a dramatic event
of importance on the Stanford stage.

Virginia Wilson, hampered by ill
ness, was a lovely and appealing
Grazia, and yet not quite vital
enough.
Less satisfying was the work of
the minor members of the cast.
Mildred Ashworth and Jane Desen
berg lacked the poise to be thor
oughly convincing, and yet formed
beautiful parts of a beautiful en
semble. Joseph Lawry and George
Leavens were unimpressive in ju
venile roles, and Mildred King,
James Benet, and Lee Chapin were
adequate in small parts.
The impression left by "Death
Takes A Holiday" was that of a
well-rounded and sensitively han
dled production, a dramatic event
of importance on the Stanford stage.
"I, Death, take on the world, the
flesh, and the devil!"
With these dramatic words, the
Grim Reaper laid aside his scythe
and his somber garments and donned
the mortal role of Prince Sirki of
Vitalba Alexandri in Harold Hel
venston's production of "Death
Takes A Holiday," given last Friday
night.
Harold Helvenston's interpretation
of Alberto Casella's imaginative
drama was marked by the same
beauty and concinnity which dis
tinguished last year's "Berkeley
Square." And Frederick Stover's
setting of the Italian castle was a
beautifully conceived and executed
affair which materially enhanced the
presentation.
Voice Shading Good
As the vacationing monarch, Val
lejo Gantner was a majestic and
compelling figure. Perhaps the out
standing thing about Gantner's in
terpretation of Death was his skill
ful shading of his voice, and that,
coupled with his perfect poise, en
abled him easily to dominate the
scenes in which he appeared. Gant
ner made Death dignified and com
manding, seriously in earnest in de
siring to understand mortals, and
yet with a quality of sardonic hu
mor.
Possibly the most difficult role in
the play was that assigned to Joseph
Wolf, who, despite an ill-fitting
dress-suit, gave an excellent inter
pretation of the Duke. It was a part
which demanded an immense
amount of- "entrained intensity, and
Wolf was thoroughly convincing.
Feminine acting honors went eas
ily to Barbara Collins, whose small
role of the Princess was through
sheer histrionic skill made into one
of the' finest performances seen by
this reviewer on the Stanford stage.
Stover Excellent
Frederick Stover injected much
comedy and not a little sympathy
into his role of the aging Baron.
Mary Anita Loos, her voice much
improved, left little to be desired
from her interpretation of Alda.
Her climactic moment with Gantner
in Act II was the dramatic highlight
of the evening, a gripping and
splendidly acted scene.
Wilson Fair

ness, was a lovely and appealing
Grazia, and yet not quite vital
enough.
