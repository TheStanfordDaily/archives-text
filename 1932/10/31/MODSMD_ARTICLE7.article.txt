# Stuart Flays Platforms Of Both Parties
## 
### David Mellinkoff 
Pointing out to the electorate the
obvious fallacies and weaknesses of
the platforms of the Republican and
Democratic parties, Professor Gra
ham H. Stuart, acting head of the
Political Science department, has
analyzed the dilemma which voters
will face on November 3.
Party Voter
Commenting on the difficult presi
dential choice, Stuart said: "That
voter is lucky whose party alle
giance determines his ballot. He can
vote as he feels, not as he thinks.
The hidebound Republican or dyed
in-the-wool Democrat or crusading
Socialist has his choice made before
the platforms. The voter with a
single idea has an equally simple
task. The Wet votes Democratic, the
conservative Republican, the friend
of the proletariat Socialist. But for
the citizen who is interested in see
ing Uncle Sam play his part in
world affairs the problem is more
difficult."
Stuart then assailed Bourbons and
Republicans alike for their evasion
of a really concrete stand on the
League of Nations, and their faulty
positions on cancellation or revision
of war debts. "War debts," he said,
"are paralyzing financial -recovery."
High Tariff Bad
Concerning the tariff Stuart was
equally emphatic. "Economists of
every party, not only in the United
States, but all over the world, prove
irrefutably that present high tariff
barriers are fatal to international
trade. What do the statesmen prom
ise to do about it? The Republicans,
not content with the present ruinous
tariff law, are ready to raise it
higher. The Democi'ats promise bet
ter but without their aid the present
bill could never have become law."
Again examining foreign affairs,
Stuart declared, "The Republicans
deserve credit for the Kelloggg-
Briand Pact, but if the Democrats
had had their way and we had en
tered the League, no such pact
might have been needed. The for
ward-looking Hoover-Stimson pol
icy in the Far East requires the
League's support to make it effec
tive.
Other Questions
"Both major parties favor dis
armament, but the Navy League is
non-partisan. Russia still awaits
recognition, but perhaps that is none
of the voter's business."
Dr. Stuart gave brief praise to the
party of Norman Thomas. He stated:
"The Socialist party deserves credit
for taking a courageous, realistic
stand on these issues, but it can af
ford to. It will not be compelled to
solve them."

Socialist has his choice made before
the platforms. The voter with a
single idea has an equally simple
task. The Wet votes Democratic, the
conservative Republican, the friend
of the proletariat Socialist. But for
the citizen who is interested in see
ing Uncle Sam play his part in
world affairs the problem is more
difficult."
Stuart then assailed Bourbons and
Republicans alike for their evasion
of a really concrete stand on the
League of Nations, and their faulty
positions on cancellation or revision
of war debts. "War debts," he said,
"are paralyzing financial -recovery."
High Tariff Bad
Concerning the tariff Stuart was
equally emphatic. "Economists of
every party, not only in the United
States, but all over the world, prove
irrefutably that present high tariff
barriers are fatal to international
trade. What do the statesmen prom
ise to do about it? The Republicans,
not content with the present ruinous
tariff law, are ready to raise it
higher. The Democi'ats promise bet
ter but without their aid the present
bill could never have become law."
Again examining foreign affairs,
Stuart declared, "The Republicans
deserve credit for the Kelloggg-
Briand Pact, but if the Democrats
had had their way and we had en
tered the League, no such pact
might have been needed. The for
ward-looking Hoover-Stimson pol
icy in the Far East requires the
League's support to make it effec
tive.
Other Questions
"Both major parties favor dis
armament, but the Navy League is
non-partisan. Russia still awaits
recognition, but perhaps that is none
of the voter's business."
Dr. Stuart gave brief praise to the
party of Norman Thomas. He stated:
"The Socialist party deserves credit
for taking a courageous, realistic
stand on these issues, but it can af
ford to. It will not be compelled to
solve them."
Pointing out to the electorate the
obvious fallacies and weaknesses of
the platforms of the Republican and
Democratic parties, Professor Gra
ham H. Stuart, acting head of the
Political Science department, has
analyzed the dilemma which voters
will face on November 3.
Party Voter
Commenting on the difficult presi
dential choice, Stuart said: "That
voter is lucky whose party alle
giance determines his ballot. He can
vote as he feels, not as he thinks.
The hidebound Republican or dyed
in-the-wool Democrat or crusading
Socialist has his choice made before
the platforms. The voter with a
single idea has an equally simple
task. The Wet votes Democratic, the
conservative Republican, the friend
of the proletariat Socialist. But for
the citizen who is interested in see
ing Uncle Sam play his part in
