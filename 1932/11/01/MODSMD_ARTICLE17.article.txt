### PAUL ZULCH 
Confessing that ho was somewhat
i stumped as how to best present the
j Socialist case in a few words, Selden
Osborne, chairman of the Stanford
' Thomas-for-President Club and
j vice-chairman of the Palo Alto
branch of the Socialist Party, ex
| coriated both major parties for their
obvious connections with huge busi
! ness interests.
"Many people are turning to the
Socialist Party in the current presi
! dential campaign because it is the
J only party which has a clear-cut,
: definite program. Norman Thomas,
j our nominee, is a man fearless and
! unafraid. Since he is not muzzled
! by obligations to private interests,
j he can say what he thinks," stated
! Osborne.
States Platform Points
The local Socialist campaigner
pointed out a few of the major ob
jectives of the Socialists as expressed
1 in their party platform. "In the first
place the Socialist Party has a pro
] posal for the immediate relief of
unemployment by two federal bond
issues of $5,000,000,000 each, one to
1 be used for direct aid to impover
j ished workers and the other to be
| expended for public works, roads,
j reforestation, and elimination of
slums in large cities. We went into

| debt during the World War, of
• which the only lasting result was
the killing and maiming of thou
j sands of men. Why shouldn't we go
| into debt to save our unemployed?
"The Socialist Party stands irre-
I vocably for the government owner-
I ship and democratic control of our
i mines, forests, oil and power re
| sources, public utilities dealing with
| light and power, transportation and
; communication, and of all other
i basic industries.
Would Ban Farm Taxes
"We aim to assist the farmer by
| a shift from taxes on farm property
|to taxes on incomes, inheritances,
| excess profits and other similar
forms of taxation. We would en
courage farmers' co-operative socie
ties and government control of
marketing agencies.
| "In international relations the
Socialist Party is opposed to all
war. We seek the immediate re
duction of armaments, the recogni
tion of the Soviet Union, and the
cancellation of war debts."
In presenting the Socialist argu
| ments Osborne pleaded that think
' ing people study the proposals made
by his party and not condemn the
Socialist program after a summary
or careless hearing.

j Socialist case in a few words, Selden
Osborne, chairman of the Stanford
' Thomas-for-President Club and
j vice-chairman of the Palo Alto
branch of the Socialist Party, ex
| coriated both major parties for their
obvious connections with huge busi
! ness interests.
"Many people are turning to the
Socialist Party in the current presi
! dential campaign because it is the
J only party which has a clear-cut,
: definite program. Norman Thomas,
j our nominee, is a man fearless and
! unafraid. Since he is not muzzled
! by obligations to private interests,
j he can say what he thinks," stated
! Osborne.
States Platform Points
The local Socialist campaigner
pointed out a few of the major ob
jectives of the Socialists as expressed
1 in their party platform. "In the first
place the Socialist Party has a pro
] posal for the immediate relief of
unemployment by two federal bond
issues of $5,000,000,000 each, one to
1 be used for direct aid to impover
j ished workers and the other to be
| expended for public works, roads,
j reforestation, and elimination of
slums in large cities. We went into

| debt during the World War, of
• which the only lasting result was
the killing and maiming of thou
j sands of men. Why shouldn't we go
| into debt to save our unemployed?
"The Socialist Party stands irre-
I vocably for the government owner-
I ship and democratic control of our
i mines, forests, oil and power re
| sources, public utilities dealing with
| light and power, transportation and
; communication, and of all other
i basic industries.
Would Ban Farm Taxes
"We aim to assist the farmer by
| a shift from taxes on farm property
|to taxes on incomes, inheritances,
| excess profits and other similar
forms of taxation. We would en
courage farmers' co-operative socie
ties and government control of
marketing agencies.
| "In international relations the
Socialist Party is opposed to all
war. We seek the immediate re
duction of armaments, the recogni
tion of the Soviet Union, and the
cancellation of war debts."
In presenting the Socialist argu
| ments Osborne pleaded that think
' ing people study the proposals made
by his party and not condemn the
Socialist program after a summary
or careless hearing.
Confessing that ho was somewhat
i stumped as how to best present the
j Socialist case in a few words, Selden
Osborne, chairman of the Stanford
' Thomas-for-President Club and
j vice-chairman of the Palo Alto
