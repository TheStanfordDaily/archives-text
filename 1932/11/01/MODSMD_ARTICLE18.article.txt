# ROWELL TALKS AT LOCAL G.O.P. RALLY TONIGHT
## S.F. Journalist Will Head Campus Hoover Meet At High School 
### 
Under the auspices of the Palo
Alto and Mayfield Hoover clubs and
the Stanford Campus Hoover Club,
Chester Rowel!, nationally read
journalist, will speak tonight at a
rally to be held in the Palo Alto
High School Auditorium. The meet
ing is scheduled to begin at 7:30
o'clock sharp.
Rowell is well known on the
campus for his popular series of
lectures on international politics
which he gives during one quarter
each year. His intimate personal ac
quaintance with political affairs, his
leady speaking ability, and his
vigorous delivery have made him
always popular on the campus.
Lauds Hoover Mind
Quite recently in one of his radio
addresses, Rowell pointed out that:
"Radio listeners to Mr. Hoover's
speeches have come into contact
with a quality of mind which his
friends have long known. Herbert
Hoover's mind is a literally stupen
dous l'espository of marshalled facts
on an outstanding number of sub
jects. He is 'master of those who
know.' On those facts he bases his
actions and by them he demon
strates the correctness of his con
clusions. . .
Show Broad Knowledge
Demonstrating the President's
versatility and the wide scope of
his knowledge, Rowell went further
to say that:
"The people have learned another
thing about President Hoover which
his friends have long knownâ€”that
he can get angry and fight. A man
oi peace, Quaker-trained in self
command, there are some things
which arouse in Herbert Hoover all
the wrath of a strong soul. . . .
Intellectual sophistry arouses him
to almost as high a pitch as does
the spectacle of moral wrong. His
intellectual integrity is so absolute,
his mental processes so straight and
sincere, that the evasions, the half
truths, and the sounding phrases of
ordinary politics make his gorge
rise."
Noted Writer Talks
Kathleen Norris, noted California
authoress, will also be present to
say a few words on behalf of
Hoover.
In order to facilitate a prompt
opening of the meeting, the parade
from the campus originally planned
will not be held, and campus resi
dents will be able to go directly to
the high school.
Everyone, whether campus inhab
itant or peninsula resident, is cor
dially invited to attend the rally.
