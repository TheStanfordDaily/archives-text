BERLIN, Oct. 31 (/P) â€”Until the
European powers acknowledge Ger
many's claim for equality in arma
ments, the Government will not
reply to a query from the League
of Nations as to whether Germany
will participate in an extension of
the one-year arms holiday which
expires tomorrow.
Germany, it was said, desires to
avoid expressing any opinion on any
measure proposed by the World
Disarmament Conference until the
question of equality is settled.
