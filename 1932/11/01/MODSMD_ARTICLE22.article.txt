# Hoover Will Return Home For Election
## Campus Arrival Tentatively Slated For Noon On November 8 
### 
Friends close to President Hoo
j ver reported late last night that the
! chief executive will probably be in
| Palo Alto one week from today in
I order to cast his ballot in the presi
dential election, according to Asso
| dated Press dispatches. The Presi
| dent's arrival here has been tenta
tively .set at noon on election day.
Although full details of the pro
| jected trip have not been settled, it
i was definitely announced that Mr.
Hoover will speak Friday afternoon
at Springfield, Illinois, and Friday
i night at St. Louis. Under the pres-
J ent schedule he would then dash
directly for the coast.
Requa Silent
Whether or not the President will
I make a last minute speech from his
j campus home, should he come west,
' could not be ascertained. Mark L.
Requa, California G.O.P. national
committeeman, refused to commit
himself one way or the other. John
L. McNab, also a committeeman and
| nominator of Mr. Hoover in the
| 1928 convention, could not be
| reached.
Dean Theodore J. Hoover of
! Stanford briefly stated that he knew
j nothing definite concerning the pro
! posed trip and that full details, if
j any, were in the hands of Commit -
! teeman Requa.
Hint Impromptu Welcome
Long rumored as a possibility, the
i President's trip to his home town
j for election eve has ceased to be a
! mere conjecture. The definite news
I on the speeches at Springfield and
! St. Louis makes the western trip
! almost a certainty, with a stop-over
for another speech in either Denver
or Salt Lake City as probabilities,
State G.O.P. officials hinted.
Should the President arrive here,
an impromptu rally similar to the
i one staged on Mr. Hoover's last ar
rival on the Stanford campus in No
vember, 1928, will undoubtedly be
i tendered him.
Sanders Sees Win
In a telephone conversation with
Requa yesterday, Everett Sanders,
Republican national chairman, pre
' dieted 288 electoral votes in sight
j for President Hoover and still more
; popular votes pouring in to in
crease that total. But 266 votes are
j necessary for election.
Sanders based his prediction on
i the returns for the period October
1 22 to 29 in the Hearst straw vote
poll. The Literary Digest poll, all
! taken before Mr. Hoovex-'s Des
! Moines speech, does not reflect the
definite swing and tremendous
j change of sentiment toward Mr.
1 Hoover since that time, he said.
