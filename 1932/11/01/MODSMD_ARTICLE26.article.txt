| Names of the 20 undergraduates
| who will do the major part of the
I writing for the 1933 Quad were an-
I nounced last night by Ray Hanson,
j editor of the book.
This writing staff, which is smaller
I than on any Quad in the last sev
! eral years, is in its complete form,
and no further additions will be
* made, Hanson said. The appoint
! m'ents are:
David McDaniel—features; Horace
| Weller—senior history; Virginia In
| grim — student government; Milo
j Tally—publications; Albert Hoxie—
' dramatics; James Feely—debating;
Bruce Bryant—music; Jillson Peat
l tie—Stanford life; Fritz Goodwin—
j football; Stewart Crawford—basket-
I ball; Albert Guerard — freshman
sports; Jack Jernegan—track; Frank
| Lloyd — baseball; Arthur Hearn —

j Olympic Games; Burke Knapp —
j minor sports; Gunther Detert —mili-
tary; Helen Eisner —women's sports;
Don Cameron (chief), Sam Easl
! man, and W. Palmer Fuller —razz
; board, and Ron Kennedy—publicity.
Art Section Separate
The comparatively small staff is
j justified, Hanson declared, by a new
i editorial policy of reserving a cer
tain amount of the writing for use
I as tryoutee material for sophomores
! on the active staff.
j For the first time in the history
I of Quad publication, the art section,
this year the work of Ihe famou.s
1 Richard Stephens, will be issued in
I a separate edition ouiside the covers
iof the book. Copies of this edition,
j which will be very limited, will be
j made available to those who order
| their Quads early, Hanson said.

Members of the following fra
| ternities are scheduled to appear
today between the hours of !♦-12
and l-4:.'{() o'clock at the Quad
Watson studio at 520 Salvaticrra
