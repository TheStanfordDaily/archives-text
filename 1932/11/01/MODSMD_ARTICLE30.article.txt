# OIL ON THE WATERS
## 
### 
Thursday morning 11 it* Daily attacked what il consid
ered a gross violation of Hie time-honored principle of
"student jobs for students." A head hashing job in Kncina i
Commons, one for years held invioialt for students, was
being handled bv a man not registered in the t'niversity.
In the vitriol of ils indignation upon learning of the ir-j
regularity, the Daily apparently left itself open to the!
charge that il was making a personal attack upon an indi-i
vidual. As for that, let it be known once and for all Ilia!
the Daily does not deal in personalities, and that the man's
name was used solely in the cause of delinitcness and au
thenticity.
Those responsible for the hiring of the unregistered
man, (lie directors of Kncina Dining I lulls and the Hoard
of Athletic Control, were Hie recipients of Thursday's edi
torial objection. The Ii.A.C. has justified ils position in
employing the individual for llie quarter. lie is holding
down a full-time iob, one which a registered student would
.... . .
be unable to handle, and lor which he is receiving a regu-'
lar monthly salary. The Daily retracts its charge against (
the B.A.C. of violating the "student jobs for students"
principle.
The directors of the dining halls have pleaded that this
man was very ellicient in Hie head hashing position, and
that, since he was out only for a quarter, the inconvenience |
of breaking in a new man for thai period justified making
an exception to the I iiivcrsily student employment policy.
The Daily recognizes the impracticability of replacing j
the unregistered head hasher with a bona fide student now,
with half the quarter gone. Hut il maintains the injustice
of hiring the man in the first place, even if it would have!
caused a slight inconvenience. After all, it is a common |
thing for Kncina head hashers It) graduate, and then the
dining luili operators face the breaking-in process without
undue difficulty.
When I lie incident occurred, say the Dining Hall op-1
crators, il was more or less an oversight, and in preparing!
to open for the quarter, they were more interested in the,
immediate problem getting oil' to an ellicient start.
Hut the hiring of this man, however efficient and de-j
serving he may be, kept out of a job some tuition-paying
freshman w ho had been waiting long for a chance to hash.
II violated a principal justly intrenched in the undergrad
uate mind. At least il ought to teach us thai such violation
of principle is the surest method of creating unrest which
il is impossible lo appease with explanation.
