# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
It's in the air. Rather, it's in the |
night air. What's in the cold evening i
Breezes? The harrowed bunch of I
sophomores you may bump into
anywhere from the "Fallen Angel"
to the President's Mansion—from
the Cactus Garden to the Roble i
Swimming Pool—are not cluttering
up the night and getting in people's
way through choice—but rather
through or*by means of Hell Week.
Hell Week is that annual pro
cedure by which the fraternities
condescend to initiate the few and j
blessed into the sacred mysteries of,
Greek Letter Brotherhood. This
communion in which the neophyte j
is made to see true fraternal light
is brought about in several ways.
Always popular is the excessive i
reddening of the sophomoric dorsum I
by means of a paddle or similar in- I
strument. All night vigils at annoy- 1
ing locales is fair; but lacks the per- j
sonal touch of running the pledges |
through the countryside—direction !
and supervision being maintained at j
all times from the front seat of an ;
automobile.
The original theory behind initia- j
tions—if there is any theory—is that !
the ritual will be a physical and I
character test for the neophyte. In |
leality, however, it is worked out i
on a pleasure-pain basis; and im- j
mediately one thinks: "Pleasure for j
the. upper-classmen and pain for I
the sophs." But no, strange as it ;
seems, both parties enjoy the fun. |
The average soph, who is being put \
through the routine that has been j
concocted, actually enjoys it —with :
all the inconvenience.
First, he has the grim satisfaction |
of knowing that his day will come; I

AIN'T IT lIELL?

and his mind made keen, by dull
and not so dull aches in the sacro
region, conceives the grandest set
of stunts for next year's class. Then
also, he has a little of the martyr i
complex—and takes obvious pride
in bragging about his sufferings to j
others. And every initiate is posi
tive that no one ever suffered like
he did!
Then, if the sophs enjoy it and
the upperclassmen find a great sense j
of pseudo-power (but power none
the less) in the procedure b> in- j
Aiding pain on those who must re
main reasonably passive, why bother
to talk about it? First of all, the j
whole business appears ludicrous in !
the extreme—especially the serious- !
ness with which so many take it— |
and everyone has a right to laugh, j
Secondly, the timing of Hell Week
this year was so mistimed, that it 1
is practically crucifying the Sopho
more Cotillion on the jagged rocks
of lack of bid distribution.
This is supposed to be THE sopho
more party—and yet Hell Week is
directly and indirectly stopping
many from going to the affair and 1
jamming up the work generally. The j
sophs have the unhappy task of j
selling 150 bids at three stone each
to break even; and to date but 31 i
ducats have slipped across the win- i
dow. Selling anything at three dot- )
lars is difficult; and the fraternities :
are not aiding the problem.
I( would be a subtle jest and at j
the same time a cruel thrust if fra- j
ternal rah-rahism should spike .
something which is supposed to be ;
almost the raison d'etre of fraterni
ties—social life. Ain't it hell?
