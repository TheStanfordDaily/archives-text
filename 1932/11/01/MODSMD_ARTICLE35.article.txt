DIARY OF A LINK SMASH KK —By
Dick Hyland. A. C. McClurg &
Co., Chicago. 1932. $1.50.
Grand old men of the student
body and a few freshmen who were
then in grammar school, among
others, doubtless will remember
turbulent Turkey Dick. Turkey
Dick, according to the California
Pelican, was a gifted Stanford foot
ball player, who, "when he ran
around the ends, would stop and
bow to all his friends."
Turkey Dick had so much experi
ence in the school of panning that
after his graduation he took advan
tage of it to rush to print with the
above-entitled book in serial form
in College Humor. It set the colle
giate and sports world by the ears
and doubtless did refreshing things
to Dick's bank account.
Those who read the story of the
publicity - seeking All - American
Stanford football star in College
Humor need not be reminded of its
contents. It rang with rancor and
traded with the truth but for the
most part it gave a faithful picture
of a football star's reactions under
given conditions. The only trouble
was that everybody assumed that
Turkey Dick was charging that all
the conditions actually existed when
he was bowing in the region of
Stanford's ends.
You read in this fiction-expose
the supposed inside story of how a
great halfback was held out of the
game because he got more publicity
than his coach; you cluck your
tongue at the injustice of an un
pleasant disciplinary episode in the
Huntington Hotel the night before
Stanford tied Alabama; your resent
ment of alleged unfair tactics by a
team no longer on Stanford's sched
ule is fanned again; charges of in
capability of a Stanford assistant
coach are again aired. Use of familiar
names and places tends to give the
book a subtle air of authenticity.
And doubtless much of the story is
historical fact. Unfortunately only
part of the truth is told in places
and the remainder is stretched till
it shrieks.
It is no time now to start airing
all this soiled laundry again. If you
read the book, don't depend upon it
as the inside story. It's not history.
But it holds real interest for one
who knows the author and that era
in Coast football of which he writes.
All through it appear evidences of
the operations of Turkey Dick's de
fense mechanism. You see him jus

; tifying A1 Regan's acts and conver
j sations, his own actions and re
• marks, both in and out of Stanford.
I You even suspect that the book was j
written more as a justification of his ;
j own acts than as an expose of foot- |
I bail, or even as a means of making
money. But it's good reading if you

Grand old men of the student
body and a few freshmen who were
then in grammar school, among
others, doubtless will remember
turbulent Turkey Dick. Turkey
Dick, according to the California
Pelican, was a gifted Stanford foot
ball player, who, "when he ran
around the ends, would stop and
bow to all his friends."
Turkey Dick had so much experi
ence in the school of panning that
after his graduation he took advan
tage of it to rush to print with the
above-entitled book in serial form
in College Humor. It set the colle
giate and sports world by the ears
and doubtless did refreshing things
to Dick's bank account.
Those who read the story of the
publicity - seeking All - American
Stanford football star in College
Humor need not be reminded of its
contents. It rang with rancor and
traded with the truth but for the
most part it gave a faithful picture
of a football star's reactions under
given conditions. The only trouble
was that everybody assumed that
Turkey Dick was charging that all
the conditions actually existed when
he was bowing in the region of
Stanford's ends.
You read in this fiction-expose
the supposed inside story of how a
great halfback was held out of the
game because he got more publicity
than his coach; you cluck your
tongue at the injustice of an un
pleasant disciplinary episode in the
Huntington Hotel the night before
Stanford tied Alabama; your resent
ment of alleged unfair tactics by a
team no longer on Stanford's sched
ule is fanned again; charges of in
capability of a Stanford assistant
coach are again aired. Use of familiar
names and places tends to give the
book a subtle air of authenticity.
And doubtless much of the story is
historical fact. Unfortunately only
part of the truth is told in places
and the remainder is stretched till
it shrieks.
It is no time now to start airing
all this soiled laundry again. If you
read the book, don't depend upon it
as the inside story. It's not history.
But it holds real interest for one
who knows the author and that era
in Coast football of which he writes.
All through it appear evidences of
the operations of Turkey Dick's de
fense mechanism. You see him jus

; tifying A1 Regan's acts and conver
j sations, his own actions and re
• marks, both in and out of Stanford.
I You even suspect that the book was j
written more as a justification of his ;
j own acts than as an expose of foot- |
I bail, or even as a means of making
money. But it's good reading if you
keep a kindly tongue in your cheek !

Stanford's ends.
You read in this fiction-expose
the supposed inside story of how a
great halfback was held out of the
game because he got more publicity
than his coach; you cluck your
tongue at the injustice of an un
pleasant disciplinary episode in the
Huntington Hotel the night before
Stanford tied Alabama; your resent
ment of alleged unfair tactics by a
team no longer on Stanford's sched
ule is fanned again; charges of in
capability of a Stanford assistant
coach are again aired. Use of familiar
names and places tends to give the
book a subtle air of authenticity.
And doubtless much of the story is
historical fact. Unfortunately only
part of the truth is told in places
and the remainder is stretched till
it shrieks.
It is no time now to start airing
all this soiled laundry again. If you
read the book, don't depend upon it
as the inside story. It's not history.
But it holds real interest for one
who knows the author and that era
in Coast football of which he writes.
All through it appear evidences of
the operations of Turkey Dick's de
fense mechanism. You see him jus

; tifying A1 Regan's acts and conver
j sations, his own actions and re
• marks, both in and out of Stanford.
I You even suspect that the book was j
written more as a justification of his ;
j own acts than as an expose of foot- |
I bail, or even as a means of making
money. But it's good reading if you
keep a kindly tongue in your cheek !

Co., Chicago. 1932. $1.50.
Grand old men of the student
body and a few freshmen who were
then in grammar school, among
others, doubtless will remember
turbulent Turkey Dick. Turkey
Dick, according to the California
Pelican, was a gifted Stanford foot
ball player, who, "when he ran
around the ends, would stop and
bow to all his friends."
Turkey Dick had so much experi
ence in the school of panning that
after his graduation he took advan
tage of it to rush to print with the
above-entitled book in serial form
in College Humor. It set the colle
giate and sports world by the ears
and doubtless did refreshing things
to Dick's bank account.
Those who read the story of the
publicity - seeking All - American
Stanford football star in College
Humor need not be reminded of its
contents. It rang with rancor and
traded with the truth but for the
most part it gave a faithful picture
of a football star's reactions under
given conditions. The only trouble
was that everybody assumed that
Turkey Dick was charging that all
the conditions actually existed when
he was bowing in the region of
Stanford's ends.
