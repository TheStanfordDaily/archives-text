# Phelan's Huskies To Make 'Last Stand' Here
## U, OF W. MENTOR MEETS FINAL TEST AT CARDS' HANDS Northerners To Face Crisis In Saturday Tilt; Have 1 Win, Loss, Tie 
### 
One victory, one tie, one defeat.
That's the conference game rec
ord Jimmy Phelan's Washington
University Huskies will bring to the
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon, determined to hand "Pop"
~Warner's game band of Indians their
third defeat of the 1932 campaign.
The 1931 Husky pack finished the
season with a similar even-steven
percentage: three won, three lost,
and one tied, but their chances of
rising above the lower division this
year are very slim.
Huskies Stand Up
Since Jimmy Phelan realized that
another bad year would cost him his
job, his players put everything they
had into the opening game with
strong Gonzaga University on Sep
tember 24, and won by a 19-7 score.
Montana was defeated on the fol
lowing Saturday, 26-13. The Hus
kies then met Oregon University,
and upset predictions by holding the
Eugene eleven to a scoreless tie.
By this time Washington alumni
were beginning to soften up, and
realized that Phelan was a pretty
good guy after all—they even be
came enthused over the possibilities
of a conference championship. Seven
days later they saw the mighty
Huskies bow before California's
"weak" team, 7-6. Considerably dis
heartened, Washington was unim
pressive in defeating Whitman last
Saturday by a 33-7 score.
Loss Would Menace Phelan
Saturday's game will be significant
to Washington in several ways. It
will be Jimmy Phelan's last stand
in conference competition, for one
more defeat would probably de
moralize the Husky eleven com
pletely. It has been characteristic of
Washington teams that once hav
ing lost their winning stride, they
find it very difficult to regain.
Even if the Huskies were
not fixed up by Phelan's dramatic
final attempt to stay on for another
year at Seattle, Washington would
be pointing for Saturday's contest
as they never pointed before. The
Huskies can't forget the way they
battled Stanford to a scoreless tie
last'year, although defeated by Ore
gon. California, and U.S.C. in other
conference games. Stanford had been
a heavy pre-game favorite, but her
reverse plays and laterals were
bogged down effectively by a com
bination of weather condition, in
juries,' and a fighting Husky forward
wall.
One victory, one tie, one defeat.

By this time Washington alumni
were beginning to soften up, and
realized that Phelan was a pretty
good guy after all—they even be
came enthused over the possibilities
of a conference championship. Seven
days later they saw the mighty
Huskies bow before California's
"weak" team, 7-6. Considerably dis
heartened, Washington was unim
pressive in defeating Whitman last
Saturday by a 33-7 score.
Loss Would Menace Phelan
Saturday's game will be significant
to Washington in several ways. It
will be Jimmy Phelan's last stand
in conference competition, for one
more defeat would probably de
moralize the Husky eleven com
pletely. It has been characteristic of
Washington teams that once hav
ing lost their winning stride, they
find it very difficult to regain.
Even if the Huskies were
not fixed up by Phelan's dramatic
final attempt to stay on for another
year at Seattle, Washington would
be pointing for Saturday's contest
as they never pointed before. The
Huskies can't forget the way they
battled Stanford to a scoreless tie
last'year, although defeated by Ore
gon. California, and U.S.C. in other
conference games. Stanford had been
a heavy pre-game favorite, but her
reverse plays and laterals were
bogged down effectively by a com
bination of weather condition, in
juries,' and a fighting Husky forward
wall.
One victory, one tie, one defeat.
That's the conference game rec
ord Jimmy Phelan's Washington
University Huskies will bring to the
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon, determined to hand "Pop"
~Warner's game band of Indians their
third defeat of the 1932 campaign.
The 1931 Husky pack finished the
season with a similar even-steven
percentage: three won, three lost,
and one tied, but their chances of
rising above the lower division this
year are very slim.
Huskies Stand Up
Since Jimmy Phelan realized that
another bad year would cost him his
job, his players put everything they
had into the opening game with
strong Gonzaga University on Sep
tember 24, and won by a 19-7 score.
Montana was defeated on the fol
lowing Saturday, 26-13. The Hus
kies then met Oregon University,
and upset predictions by holding the
Eugene eleven to a scoreless tie.
