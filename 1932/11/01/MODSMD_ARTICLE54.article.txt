A LOT OF STANFORD
ROUGHS, who have seen Stan
ford varsities lose to S.C. in
everything from football to
water polo, sat in the stands
Saturday and watched the fresh
man football team drub the
Trobabes with more than a little
pride and relief.
It's nice to beat the Trojans in
something, anything, but those who
are already predicting that Stanford
is about to enter on a golden era of
prosperity and plenty, which will
avenge all the setbacks that the
Cardinal has received in late years,
had best keep their pennies in the
old sock until they see Stanford
varsities and frosh do the unbeliev
able.

For example, don't forget that
seven or eight of the Trobabes who
tied California 6-6 some weeks ago
were not in the game Saturday, and
they have only to maintain a "C"
average to play on the Trojan var
sity next year, if Head Man Jones
needs them.
<£> <e>
IF THERE ARE ANY MORE lit
tle playfellows back at Kiski Prep,
in Pennsylvania, Stanford could
certaintly do worse than get some
more of them out here.
This boy "Bones" Hamilton is
just naturally GOOD, and that's
all there is to it! He isn't a great
ball-carrier yet. Don't know that
he ever will be. But if nothing
happens to him before the Old
Fox has a chance to get him on
the varsity, the Farm is going
to have its own counterpart of
Blocker Pinckert. Hamilton just
takes the ball-carrier under his
wing and leads him through,
around, and sometimes over the
enemy.
At one time during Saturday's
game, "Bones" dropped back to run
interference for Sheldon Bronstein.
Two Trobabes made for the runner.
Hamilton paid no attention whatso
ever to the nearest one, took the
second out neatly, and only the fact
that a third one managed to run
Bronstein out of bounds saved Troy
from watching the fleet-footed half
score another.
In spite of the fact that S.C. did
, not have all of its regulars in the
battle, there is hope in the fact that
the Cards did very well with parts
of the second and third strings in
the game. Johnny Reisner didn't
even get to play, and he rates right
behind Bob Grayson as the shiftiest
i yearling halfback.

IF COACH HARRY MA
LONEY'S soccer aspirants put
on another exhibition like the
one last Saturday, when they
beat San Jose 2-1, they will
have to pay for the burial of
the few spectators who come out
to watch them.
The Redshirts had the ball in
front of the Staters' goal most of
the morning, and yet they couldn't
seem to keep it away from the goal
posts, the crossbar, or some purple
and-gold player.
Stanford had something like twen
i ty-five open cracks at their op
ponents' goal, and yet they had to
score in the last few seconds of play
to pull the game out of the fire,
after San Jose had tied the score

with only two minutes of play re
maining.

REPORTS BROUGHT BACK
BY SOME of our little pals who
watched the Bruins tear up Mr.
Zack Farmer's pet goal posts,
have it that the Stanford line
looked tired out when it went
into the game.
All we can say is that we certain
ly hope that they rate some rest
before the California game. If we
have any hope of winning the Wash
ington game, it seems to hand on
the shoulders of the' substitute line
men.
The regulars will have all they
can take care of when they tackle
"Navy Bill's" Golden Bears. They
are getting tougher every week, and
they will have recovered from the
S.C. battle by the time the Big
Game rolls around. —R.D.W.Jr.

A LOT OF STANFORD
ROUGHS, who have seen Stan
ford varsities lose to S.C. in
everything from football to
water polo, sat in the stands
Saturday and watched the fresh
man football team drub the
Trobabes with more than a little
pride and relief.
It's nice to beat the Trojans in
something, anything, but those who
are already predicting that Stanford
is about to enter on a golden era of
prosperity and plenty, which will
avenge all the setbacks that the
Cardinal has received in late years,
had best keep their pennies in the
old sock until they see Stanford
varsities and frosh do the unbeliev
able.

For example, don't forget that
seven or eight of the Trobabes who
tied California 6-6 some weeks ago
were not in the game Saturday, and
they have only to maintain a "C"
average to play on the Trojan var
sity next year, if Head Man Jones
needs them.

IF THERE ARE ANY MORE lit
tle playfellows back at Kiski Prep,
in Pennsylvania, Stanford could
certaintly do worse than get some
more of them out here.
This boy "Bones" Hamilton is
just naturally GOOD, and that's
all there is to it! He isn't a great
ball-carrier yet. Don't know that
he ever will be. But if nothing
happens to him before the Old
Fox has a chance to get him on
the varsity, the Farm is going
to have its own counterpart of
Blocker Pinckert. Hamilton just
takes the ball-carrier under his
wing and leads him through,
around, and sometimes over the
enemy.
At one time during Saturday's
game, "Bones" dropped back to run
interference for Sheldon Bronstein.
Two Trobabes made for the runner.
Hamilton paid no attention whatso
ever to the nearest one, took the
second out neatly, and only the fact
that a third one managed to run
Bronstein out of bounds saved Troy
from watching the fleet-footed half
score another.
In spite of the fact that S.C. did
, not have all of its regulars in the
battle, there is hope in the fact that
the Cards did very well with parts
of the second and third strings in
the game. Johnny Reisner didn't
even get to play, and he rates right
behind Bob Grayson as the shiftiest
i yearling halfback.

All we can say is that we certain
ly hope that they rate some rest
before the California game. If we
have any hope of winning the Wash
ington game, it seems to hand on
the shoulders of the' substitute line
men.
The regulars will have all they
can take care of when they tackle
"Navy Bill's" Golden Bears. They
are getting tougher every week, and
they will have recovered from the
S.C. battle by the time the Big
Game rolls around. —R.D.W.Jr.
