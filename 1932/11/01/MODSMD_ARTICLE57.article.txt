# POLOISTS JUGGLE LINE-UP FOR SAN MATEO OPENER
## 
### BILL MEYERS 
Stanford's poloists will face the
San Mateo Polo Club this Friday
with an untried and juggled line
up which may take a bad beating
from the seasoned players that Wil
lie Tevis, Jr., is bringing down with
him.
The revised line-up which has
been working together for less than
two weeks has Woody Melone at
number one, Rufus Spalding at two,
Captain Pete Gillham at three, and
Johnny. Myers at back.
Spalding is the only man who
has ever played in any matches at
the position he will take in Fridays'
game. Starting out last year at
number one, he was shifted to two
at the end of the season. Spalding
is the most accurate shooter on the
team, and should be at the top of
the scoring list for the Redshirts.
Pete Gillham, captain of the team,
may have a little trouble getting
used to the number three berth.
Last season Gillham was at number
one, but Captain Dick Gordan,
coach, thinks that Gillham's mighty
drives will be more useful at one
of the back positions. He hits the
longest ball on the team, and his

wallops should be a big help at
keeping the ball out of Stanford
territory.
Up at number one will be Woody
Melone, first substitute on last
year's team. Melone has usually
played at three, and he, too, may
find it hard to click in his new posi
tion.
Johnny Myers, at back, will be
playing his first varsity match. My
ers is 1 a hard-riding player and
cracks out some long wallops. He
and Gillham make a good defensive
pair, and with a little more expe
rience playing together should
equal the famed Fleming - Lewis
combination of last year.
Tevis has not yet announced his
starting line-up. The San Mateo
outfit usually is- about a 15-goal
team, however, and is one of the
flashiest teams on the Peninsula.
The match will probably be played
on a handicap basis to make up for
the difference in ability in the two
teams.
The match will be played on the
Highway field here on the campus
at 3 o'clock Friday afternoon. There
will be no admission charge.
