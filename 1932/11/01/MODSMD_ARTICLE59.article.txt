# Big Game Rooting Stunt Contest Ends Tomorrow
## 
### 
All ideas and sketches for the Big
Game Card stunt contest must be
submitted by 5 o'clock tomorrow at
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old
Union, according to an announce
ment by Rally Committee Chairman
Bob Churchill last night.
Ideas are to be sketched roughly
but simply enough so that the au
thor's ideas are clear. They need not
be elaborate. Prizes will be awarded
the winners by Palo Alto merchants.
