# Frosh Gridders Face Cal Babes
## Pin Hopes On Grayson; Cal Team Strong 
### 
Hoping to climax the most suc
cessful freshman football season in
years with a win in their Big-Little
Game, Stanford's freshmen will face
California's yearlings Saturday at
Berkeley. The U.C. babes, with a
powerful group of players, will be
cut to make a fair season brilliant
by downing the favorite Papooses.
Stanford hopes increased when it
was learned yesterday that Bob
Grayson, regular left half, will be
able to play. Grayson left the U.S.C.
frosh game in the second quarter
with his teeth protruding through
his lower lip due to the placing
of a football shoe on his chin.
Nine stitches brought the lip back
together again, and Grayson plans
to wear a special pad and again to
lead the yearling attack. Johnny
Reisner, ace of substitutes, will also
be in shape. Reisner did not com
pete in the Trojan game because of
a weak leg; rest has mended the
limb and he will be ready to relieve
Grayson.
Although neither Grayson nor
Bob Hamilton were in suits, the
frosh drove through a fast signal
drill yesterday. Coach Chuck Win
terburn opened the session with the
cystomary Monday afternoon chalk
talk, and then the first four teams
ran signals up and down the field
until dark. A game may be sched
uled with a San Francisco high
school for those frosh who do not
make the trip to Berkeley Saturday.
