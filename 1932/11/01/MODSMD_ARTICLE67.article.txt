# FEAR FARM WATER SUPPLY FOR 1933 SLIGHTLY LOWER
## 
### 
YV'ith the rainy season fast ap
proaching, Searsville and Felt lakes,
Stanford's two most important reser
voirs, still retain approximately a
third of their total volume of water,
according to a report by the engi
neering department, which keeps ac
curate measurements on the s e
sources of the University's irrigation
supply.
At present, 113,000,000 gallons of
water remain in Felt lake, which has
a capacity of 320,000,000, while Sears
ville, which can store 305,000,000 if
necessary, now contains only 105,-
000,000.
However, J. R. McDonnel, assistant
superintendent of grounds and
buildings, has issued the reassuring
statement that since the rainy sea
son is coming on, the present water
storage of the two lakes will be suf
ficient to take care of Stanfprd's
needs, in view of the fact that the
volume of irrigation watei is ex
pected to drop off sharply in the next
two weeks. The report shows also
that during the last week a total of
only 8,000,000 gallons has been used
on the campus for all purposes.
Last year's rains filled both reser
voirs to the brim, storing a total of
025,000,000 gallons. Since October 1,
1931, Stanford has consumed in irri
gation approximately 472,000,000 gal
lons, of which 72,000,000, however,
were pumped from wells.
For domestic use on the campus
one hundred and forty-one million
gallons have been pumped during the
past year.
