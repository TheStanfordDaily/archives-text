# SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY SAN MATEO
## 
### 
Apparently on the comeback trail,
the Stanford varsity soccer team
! prepares today for the toughest two
weeks of its schedule, tv/o weeks in
! which Coach Maloney's men will
play four games, culminating with
the final lilts with California on
November 12 and 19.
i First encounter of this hard as
' signment is the second of the two
i game series with San Mateo, to be
; played tomorrow afternoon on the
local field. In their first meeting of
| the season, a 2-2 tie was the result,
J so tomorrow's engagement will settle
! the series for this year.
California will be the opponent
this week-end with the league-lead
j ing S.F.U. eleven on deck for Wed
j nesday of next week.
I Stanford's standing in the confer
ence shot up to a 6G6 percentage
with the win over San Jose State
last Saturday. Both of the season's
victories have been at the expense
of this San Jose team, while the one
1 defeat came from S.F.U., the only
j undefeated squad in the league,
j Coach Maloney worked his men
. lightly yesterday, and will probably
I do the same today as the team's best
' efforts must be preserved for the
| regular games, two in one week be
! ing a severe test of stamina.
