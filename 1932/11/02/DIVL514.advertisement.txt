Engineering ?
Harry D. Watts, V. P. of James
Stewart 8C Co., Inc., builders
of the Grand Central Terminal
in New York City, says: "World
progress depends upon engineer
ing. No wonder eager college
men look toward this profession.
But to succeed you must have a
technical background, ability to
take the knocks, and alertness to
take advantage of the breaks."
f, A BILITY to take the knocks." And
A yet brains count above all.
That's why in engineering, as in coI j
lege, a pipe is the favorite smoke. A
pipeful of good old Edgeworth Smok
ing Tobacco clears the brain for those
intensive problems that confront th«
engineer ... or the college man.
Of course most college men knovc
l Edgeworth.* They like its distinctive
lavor that comes only from this blenc
.->f fine old burleys. Perhaps you'd like
0 try before you buy*. Then just writs
>o Larus & Bro. Co., 105 S. 226. St..
Richmond, Va., and you'll get a free
-.ample packet of Edgeworth.
