# Stanford Gold Hunters Tell Nevada Adventures
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
''Nothing like it" i'or a minimum j
of cost and a maximum of fun, de- i
clare three Stanford students who |
spent a month last summer looking !
for gold in northeastern Nevada. '
"Even if we didn't strike anything;
but hard luck, the idea is still good." [
Including food, shelter, ancl gas J
for a '22 touring car the total ex- j
penses were less than fifty cents a j
day per person. Bill Rubens, Trell j
Lund, and Harlan Hess were the.
adventurers.
Gold or no gold, the three poten- |
iial millionaires returned feeling!
like explorers and wealthy in at
least experience.
Things were not dull all the time. |
"One afternoon," says Bill Rubens,
"I was on a survey of the hills near j
our camp and I almost stepped on ,
a rattler. He was an old-timer with j
six rattles. It is hard to say who
who was more scared, the rattler,;
or myself. We both turned tail, and i
dashed away in opposite directions.

The rattler hid for awhile in a pile
oi' brush, until a few large stones
put him out of his misery."
''Another time," related Rubens,
"we ran out of cash and went into
a small town to get a check cashed.
Nobody knew us, and no one would
cash the check, until we ran into
the district attorney, Merwyn
Brown, '21 4 who gave us the money
without a murmur. And we ate."
Rubens also told about the time
they ran out of gas, and after pro
curing some, he attempted to put
it into the tank by means of a home
made siphon. "The only gas I was
able to get through the tubing I in
advertently swallowed. After drink
ing a big mouthful of gas, I drank a
can of evaporated milk, the com
bination producing a semi-drunken
condition and a splitting headache.
That was part of the fun, almost, as
much a.s the purple hills off in the
distance, the clean fresh air, and the
moon rising from behind the moun
tains."

''Nothing like it" i'or a minimum j
of cost and a maximum of fun, de- i
clare three Stanford students who |
spent a month last summer looking !
for gold in northeastern Nevada. '
"Even if we didn't strike anything;
but hard luck, the idea is still good." [
Including food, shelter, ancl gas J
for a '22 touring car the total ex- j
penses were less than fifty cents a j
day per person. Bill Rubens, Trell j
Lund, and Harlan Hess were the.
adventurers.
Gold or no gold, the three poten- |
iial millionaires returned feeling!
like explorers and wealthy in at
least experience.
Things were not dull all the time. |
"One afternoon," says Bill Rubens,
"I was on a survey of the hills near j
our camp and I almost stepped on ,
a rattler. He was an old-timer with j
six rattles. It is hard to say who
who was more scared, the rattler,;
or myself. We both turned tail, and i
dashed away in opposite directions.

The rattler hid for awhile in a pile
oi' brush, until a few large stones
put him out of his misery."
''Another time," related Rubens,
"we ran out of cash and went into
a small town to get a check cashed.
Nobody knew us, and no one would
cash the check, until we ran into
the district attorney, Merwyn
Brown, '21 4 who gave us the money
without a murmur. And we ate."
Rubens also told about the time
they ran out of gas, and after pro
curing some, he attempted to put
it into the tank by means of a home
made siphon. "The only gas I was
able to get through the tubing I in
advertently swallowed. After drink
ing a big mouthful of gas, I drank a
can of evaporated milk, the com
bination producing a semi-drunken
condition and a splitting headache.
That was part of the fun, almost, as
much a.s the purple hills off in the
distance, the clean fresh air, and the
moon rising from behind the moun
tains."
