# BONNER TALKS ON GREEK ARTS
## 'Lysistrata' Banned In B.C. Just As In 1932

That a comedy of Aristophanes
brought prosecution in the fifth cen
| tury B.C. just as his "Lysistrata"
I brought legal action in Los Angeles
! last spring was the revelation of Dr.
j Robert J. Bonner, speaking last night
j in the Little Theatre on the sub
j ject of Grecian literature.
Declaring that the golden age of
! Athenian literature and oratory was
| at the time of greatest political de
j mocracy. Bonner proceeded to point
j out the important characteristics of
I the era. State subsidy of the drama
| was important. Not only did the
| government conduct dramatic con
i tests, but it also permitted an un
| usual freedom of speech in the plays,
i Comedies were characterized by
j their ridicule. Only in special cases
i of attack upon the state itself was
I prosecution employed.
J Grecian oratory and literature
i were closely united. Orations were
j frequently read by the masses,
while literary phrases, and epigrams
| were a feature of forensic composi
j tion. "The Greeks cared for oratory
as we care for music," said Bonner.
| Even a seemingly dull court trial
I was a matter of great interest. Solon
stimulated the public interest in
I oratorical style by proclaming in
j 354 B.C. that each court litigant
must either plead his own case or
: obtain an expert pleader or lawyer.
J Play contests were judged ulti
| mately by audience reaction. Ex
j pert critics watched the effect of
| the drama upon the people. Vigor-
J ous and vociferous approval or re
! jection was the manner of the day.
i In some cases the sponsors of poor
i plays were hailed into court, al
' though usually "bad taste in litera
' ture was not a punishable offense."
