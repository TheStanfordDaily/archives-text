fidence that the voters will cast their

of "common sense and vote for

of home and country," was expressed
by Ray Lyman Wilbur, secretary of
the interior, in a campaign address
here tonight.
"I have seen thousands of persons
make emergency decisions and meet
issues that were for them decisive
in the last degree. There may have
been some emotional stir and much
perturbation, but the issue was
squarely and fairly met when the
facts and the situation were at
hand."
"Common Sense" Plea
"In this campaign, just such a de
cision lies before each voter. He
may have talked, complained, have
had little knowledge of real condi
tions. but when he is alone in the
voting booth with his conscience
and his God. I am convinced that
he will use his common sense and
vote for safety, stability and the
protection of his home and coun
try."
"It is not a Test of the leadership
of President Hoover. The evidence
of the great constructive program
which he has used to save the fi
nancial and economic life of the
nation is now well known. Our peo
ple can see about, them the evidence
of the bold genius who put those
beams of support under our totter
ing financial and economic struc
ture, hit by a world-wide hurri
cane, and which kept it from col
lapse."
