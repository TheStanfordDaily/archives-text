# Varsity Whips Reserve Team By 9-0 Score
## Stevens, Van Dellen Star In Backfield Play 
### Dick Rodda 
While most members of the Card
' varsity grid eleven took a much
; needed rest, the reserves had their
j first taste of competition since the
| lArmy game, defeating the Gray
! squad 9 to 0 in a scrimmage game
| last night.
Pass Defense Weak
And just as in the Army battle,
Van Dellen, White, and Stevens in
the Card backfield were outstand
j ing. Likewise, the pass defense of
this eleven was weak and permitted
I the Grays to gain most of their
i yardage through the air.
The line of the varsity subs
played fairly consistent football al
lowing the Grays to penetrate for
only short gains. Minckler, Van
j Kirk, Prelsnik, and Packard were
| perhaps the most aggressive on the
| forward wall, nailing the Gray
I backs behind the scrimmage line on
; several occasions. Shortly after the
| reserves had accounted for the only
I touchdown of the afternoon this
' line pushed the Grays deep into
their own territory and blocked a
! kick. The ball bounded beyond"
! the end zone, scoring an automatic
; safety.
Two Injuries
While the contest did not reveal
I anything in the way of varsity ma- i
| terial that had not already been'
I discovered in the Army tilt, it did |
I have its unfavorable results in the i
1 form of injuries to two members of I
; (he third varsity. Scribner, right j
\ guard, hurt his knee and was car- [
ried from the field. He will prob- !
ably be out of the lineup for a j
| couple of weeks. The other injury
i was a twisted ankle received by
I Van Dellen, but is not serious
i enough to keep him out of a uni- j
| form.
Among the five varsity gridders j
who received minor injuries in the!
Bruin game last Saturday Bates and i
Hillman are the only two who are |
in the doubtful class concerning the;
starting lineup for the Washington j
game here Saturday. Unless Hill- '
man's knee shows much improve-'
ment within the next day or so
Phil Baker will be in the fullback
post against the Huskies. That Al
bertson will open in place of Bates ;
is also nearly certain.

Although losing by one touch-,
down and a safety in their game
with the varsity last night, Coaches 1
Cuddeback and Nevers' Gray squad
turned in a more than creditable
account of itself, giving "Pop" War
ners third stringers all the work
out they wanted for one evening. .
A team composed of Smith and
Steiner at ends, Drown and Fuller
at tackles, Cooke and Black at
guards, Bates at center, Massey,
quarter, Capitelli and Seaver.
halves, and Strong at fullback
started and played most of the
game.
Muller, voluntarily demoted from
Ihe varsity, went in later at center
and turned in a bang-up game, es
pecially on the defense. Charles
Seaver, showing marked improve
ment over his work last year on the
frosh, was outstanding in a triple
threat role for the Grays. His
passes, gains on running plays, and,
accurate kicks to the coffin corner,
were an important factor in the!
good showing made by the Gray
squad.
