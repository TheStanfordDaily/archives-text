# Pajama Clad [Not Clear] To Parade To [Not Clear] In Annual Jamboree
## Rally Precedes Pajamarino, Scheduled For Thursday Night, To Stir Up Enthusiasm For Yearly U.C.-Stanford Freshman Game 
### 
j T'S tomorrow night at o'clock when they cut loose down al Kncinn
llall, to parade grandly over the campus with a gigantic anti-climax
on Koble lawn an hour or so later. The climax, of course, comes when
they throng into Palo Alto and the Indian Babes go on the warpath down
University avenue.
Originally scheduled for tonight, and postponed because of fraternity
rushing opening this evening, the annual freshman pajamarino and rally

"will start at that time, according to
Assistant Yell-leader Al Peache.'
Encina Rally
From 7 until 8 o'clock, members
of '36 will visit the How and learn
what's what among the Greeks, and
at 8:30 o'clock they will meet in
i Encina lobby clad in pajamas of all
| descriptions.
A brief rally will be hold in the
l lobby, conducted by Yell-leader
Jerry Hampton and his assistants,
Al Peache and Dan Ellis. All fresh
men are asked to learn Stanford
songs and yells so that they may be
used successfully tomorrow.
To Arouse Spirit
The event, the first real big thing
for the freshmen, is to work up
spirit for the Little-Big Game which
is scheduled for Berkeley Saturday.
This year's class, the largest in re
cent years, is expected to have the
best and most effective pajamarino
seen on the campus in some period.
After the short, snappy rally, the
yearlings will form in columns and
parade up the back road between
the halls and up to Alvarado Row,
past the Phi Kap house and over to
Lasuen, where the mass will turn
right past the Pi Phi house and back
again down Lasuen lo the post office,
attired only in pajamas.
Koble Next
Here the procession will turn left
and continue on to Roble, where the
real fun will begin on Roble lawn,
All girls are expected to be at the
windows as the freshmen gaze up
wards at the many duplicates ol'
Juliet's well-known balcony.
Yells will be given there for the
freshman team, unbeaten thus far
J,bis season and showing infinitely
more promise than recent Card
frosh squads have displayed, and
songs will be joined in by both frosh
and the adjacent portion of the
"500." There will be no speakers.
Band to Lead
Freshmen are expected to bring
plenty of cowbells and other noise
makers along, and it is probable that
a good deal of unexpected cat-call
ing will furnish ample diversion.
The Stanford band will lead the
parade of pajama-clad jamboreca
dors and the Farm's fire department
is scheduled to add an engine to the
merriment with accompanying si
rens.
"Heaven help the Paly shows!"
has been the slogan of theatre man
agers in rcccnt years, but freshmen
are asked not to cause any damage
v/hen they pour into town after
festivities are over on Roble's lawn.
Last year a lady was injured as the
throng broke through a door in the
Stanford Theatre.
University authorities request that
those who join in the pajamarino
remain on the campus instead of
causing any disturbance in Palo
Alto. Every year, however, this re
quest has gone unheeded. Last year,
il is remembered, the male portion
of the freshman class remained on
Roble lawn for a while chanting,
"We want women!'' but would not
venture inside the hall. This year's
group is reported to be more daring
and planning fo enter the famed
bastile in full array.

bastile in full array.
j T'S tomorrow night at o'clock when they cut loose down al Kncinn
llall, to parade grandly over the campus with a gigantic anti-climax
on Koble lawn an hour or so later. The climax, of course, comes when
they throng into Palo Alto and the Indian Babes go on the warpath down
University avenue.
Originally scheduled for tonight, and postponed because of fraternity
rushing opening this evening, the annual freshman pajamarino and rally

"will start at that time, according to
Assistant Yell-leader Al Peache.'
Encina Rally
From 7 until 8 o'clock, members
of '36 will visit the How and learn
what's what among the Greeks, and
at 8:30 o'clock they will meet in
i Encina lobby clad in pajamas of all
| descriptions.
A brief rally will be hold in the
l lobby, conducted by Yell-leader
Jerry Hampton and his assistants,
Al Peache and Dan Ellis. All fresh
men are asked to learn Stanford
songs and yells so that they may be
used successfully tomorrow.
To Arouse Spirit
The event, the first real big thing
for the freshmen, is to work up
spirit for the Little-Big Game which
is scheduled for Berkeley Saturday.
This year's class, the largest in re
cent years, is expected to have the
best and most effective pajamarino
seen on the campus in some period.
After the short, snappy rally, the
yearlings will form in columns and
parade up the back road between
the halls and up to Alvarado Row,
past the Phi Kap house and over to
Lasuen, where the mass will turn
right past the Pi Phi house and back
again down Lasuen lo the post office,
attired only in pajamas.
Koble Next
Here the procession will turn left
and continue on to Roble, where the
real fun will begin on Roble lawn,
All girls are expected to be at the
windows as the freshmen gaze up
wards at the many duplicates ol'
Juliet's well-known balcony.
Yells will be given there for the
freshman team, unbeaten thus far
J,bis season and showing infinitely
more promise than recent Card
frosh squads have displayed, and
songs will be joined in by both frosh
and the adjacent portion of the
"500." There will be no speakers.
Band to Lead
Freshmen are expected to bring
plenty of cowbells and other noise
makers along, and it is probable that
a good deal of unexpected cat-call
ing will furnish ample diversion.
The Stanford band will lead the
parade of pajama-clad jamboreca
dors and the Farm's fire department
is scheduled to add an engine to the
merriment with accompanying si
rens.
"Heaven help the Paly shows!"
has been the slogan of theatre man
agers in rcccnt years, but freshmen
are asked not to cause any damage
v/hen they pour into town after
festivities are over on Roble's lawn.
Last year a lady was injured as the
throng broke through a door in the
Stanford Theatre.
University authorities request that
those who join in the pajamarino
remain on the campus instead of
causing any disturbance in Palo
Alto. Every year, however, this re
quest has gone unheeded. Last year,
il is remembered, the male portion
of the freshman class remained on
Roble lawn for a while chanting,
"We want women!'' but would not
venture inside the hall. This year's
group is reported to be more daring
and planning fo enter the famed
bastile in full array.
