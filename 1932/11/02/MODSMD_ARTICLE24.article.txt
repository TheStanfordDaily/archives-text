# THAT AXE

### 
Willi (in.Â«_>('s of Hliio and Cold looming brighter each day
on the gridiron horizon, the Farm is rapidly approaching
that period in the year when Big (lame mania reigns. All
the hoary tradition of that age-old rivalry will flow in quan
tities abundant. The Big "C" up behind the Campanile will
be guarded for a week. Stanford's bonfire will be built and
protected with lines of barbed wire, like a battle field. Hu
mors of this and that will fly, and men will sing indelicate
songs.
Through all this an implement so steeped in tradition
that it is the perfect symbol of all that is "Big (lame" will
rest in a cold, dark bank vault in Palo Alto. It is the Stan
ford Axe, that precious weapon that was returned to the
Farm in the Spring of '.'}(> bv the intrepid "twenty-one"
after il had been in California's possession for thirty-one
years. Kvervone will agree that the vault ought not to be
come its permanent grave. Then what can be done?
Bring it out for a rally once each year, as California
did before il was regained? Impossible. The excitement
would be even greater, after two years, than it was that
night in April, 1930, when a mob of Californians invaded
this campus and damaged property in a clumsy attempt to
recapture Ihe weapon that had been cleverly snatched
from them. Verily, the Berkeley horde would blast Ihe
Quad from its foundations. And athletic relations with
California would have to be severed.
There is only one solution, only one condition under
which the Axe can be brought out in the open to become
available to those who would gossip over a trophy case,
calling up memories of the good old days, or of the tradi
tion behind the Axe.
, Put il up as a trophy, to be presented lo the winning
eleven out there on Ihe field right after the battle. It
would add a stirring touch to the regular post-game cere
mony of hymn-singing. And the victor who had won il
fairly and squarely could keep il without the protection of
a bank vault. The losing school certainly could not be
unsportsmanlike enough to stage a raid to get it back.
The objections to Ihe scheme, of course, will come from
those who think that the Axe rightfully belongs to us, since
il was ours originally and we have fought for il.
All right, let Ihem be heard, and keep it in the vault.
Two more years, and there will not be a student in either
institution who has ever seen it. It will die a natural death,
and a tradition that can never be replaced will waste away.
Then, 100, il w ill be a pity lo see the "(live 'em the Axe" !
yell lose ils fire. It was Stanford's best.
