# BULL SESSION
## ARE CO-EDS DUMB? 
### 
Along with such trifling questions
as the gold-standard, cosmic rays,
and pseudo-symbolism in modern
art—we find a really vital problem:
[ "Are co-eds dumb, or do they just
| seem that way?" The male populace
j seems irrevocably divided on this
issue—half holding that, co-eds are
dumb and the other half maintain
ing that they only appear lumpish.
Personally, though once a fighter
with the former # crowd, I have since
moved my pen-point to the other |
end of the holder and now find my- ;
self a firm supporter of the "only- j
seem-that-way" party. Biology J
seems to have proved beyond rea
sonable doubt by running guinea !
pigs through mazes that women are
basically of the same intellectual 1
capacity as men. And psychology j
has verified this fact with white
rats. That question is settled.
Then, we may ask ourselves, why
are modern co-eds what they are? j
They have been given equal educa
tional opportunity. It would seem j
lhat with equal endowment and like
opportunity, they would approach !
the male intellectual standard. But,
everyone knows that this is not the '
case. The reason, as awful as it
sounds, must be blurted out. The
truth must prevail. The reason i.s
the men.
Men want dates; and women I
themselves are not adverse to a;
little dating now and then. The cus- j
tomer Ls always right, and men pay- j
ing for the evening's whirl must be '
pleased. He sets the standard and I
the women meet that standard; or
stay at home to darn socks and
catch up on some urgent studying. I
Egotism being the most dominant I

11 note in life, and male egotism being
I even worse than that, the man must
I always come home from a date fully
I convinced of his admitted superior
ity.
| This can only be done by the
I woman curbing what intellectual
i glimmerings she may have. Some
j men enjoy dates who are too dumb
j to get their clever witticisms; some
others like them just dumb enough
! to get the drift; and none like them
|so smart that they have a better
: comeback. The women soon catch
jon; and the self-imposed mental
I atrophy has usually begun by col
lege; and is in % full sv/ing one or
\ two years after marriage.
The brain cells do not dry up and
j die completely. The normal intel
lectual energy is diverted into the
unceasing endeavor to garner a full
.share of the feminine attributes—
coyness, moderate simpleness, his
i Irionics, attractiveness, etc. And so
| Eetty Co-ed becomes a bubbling
1 stream gibbering and splashing on
her wayless way.
The men are actually afraid of
the intelligent woman. Her company
is too much of a strain; and an im
pending danger at all times. The
omnipresent threat of her cracking
his ego is positively too much. She
is not popular. The most popular
l girls are either naturally dumb or
J are ver ysk'Uful in concealing the
j spiritual spark.
Whether this continual cerebral
l repression will ever affect the- struc
tural capacity of the female species
is not yet known. A Mr. Lamarck
I says, '"Yes." But we hope to the
I contrary. —Abe Mellinkoff
