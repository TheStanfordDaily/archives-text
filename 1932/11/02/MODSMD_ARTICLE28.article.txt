IIOUNI) AND HORN. October-,
December 19U2. $.50.
The Autumn issue of this active !
quarterly is of varied interest. The j
first article is a badly written essay :
on Communism in America by M. !
R. Werner, a writer for Liberty I
Magazine. In a roundabout, repor
torial fashion the author proves
nothing.
E. E. Cummings, that wag of the
moderns, also discourses upon Rus
sia, but in his usual chaotic prose
style. I suppose one would call "The
Tomb of Lenin" a story, although j
as much of it as I could bear to j
read seemed like a scrambled comic j
section of Dostoyevsky and Freud j
at Coney Island. I see no excuse for j
such bad writing as, "Who myself;
amazes by giving helpmate a whole j
single entire full box of really-truly I
matches (surreptitiously she slips ■
them to myself, who much sorely I
am in need)." Cummings' obscur- j
antism does not flow with the easy |
music of Gertrude Stein's prose, and
his funny capers are usually stupid. j
Two poems by J. V. Cunningham,!
a Stanford student, are about the j
best things in the magazine. They j
are done in his classically polished i
style, with intellectual sententious- j
ness phrased in neatly-rhythmod!
quatrains. Any obscurantism in j
Cunningham's work might arise j
from the too replete and sensitive i
intellectuality of its author. The:
second of "To Poems" is a revised j
version of one which appeared in J
the English Club Yearbook for .1932. !
Cunningham also writes . the j
Poetry Chronicle this quarter, dis- 1
cussing the threatened demise of j
Harriet Monroe's magazine, Poetry,!
in an adroit balance of its debits 1
and credits.
Other contributors are Marianne !
Moore, with one of her lengthy j
pedantic poems, T. S. Eliot with a I
banal tour-de-force entitled "Diffi- j
culties of a Statesman," and Caro- 11
line Gordon with a long "folksy" i I

story. —Broughton.
BLACK MISCHIEF — By Evelyn
Waugh. Farrar and Rinehart. 1932.
(At the Gordon Strawbridge Li
brary.)
Young Englishmen are too fre
quently merely irrepressibly clever.
Waugh's book, while it might be
considered merely another attempt
to be witty, does rise somewhat
above the opprobrium accompany
ing that sad state.
It is relatively quiet in its in
sanity and satire—at the expense of
diplomats relegated to small, dark
independences which change gov
ernments overnight.
There are several pleasantly un
expected elements in the book, not
the least of which is Waugh's proof
that he can write and not be face
tious. A description of a jungle
camp at night occupying a single
page is excellently done.
This is satire, but unlike the
exaggerated antics of Thorne Smith
and even Aldous Huxley, it is
smooth and still biting. —Sandoe.
