### 
! Nothing could be more timely j
\ than Sword and Sandals' reading of
j the political satire, "Of Thee I Sing,"
I to be given tomorrow night at 7:30
i o'clock in the Little Theatre. At a
j time when eve;y radio is screaming '
: with the claims and accusations of j
i excited campaign speakers, thi.s
I spectacular farce, which calmly set
| ties unemployment by tasty corn
-1 muffins and joyfully proclaims that
j "posterity is just around the cor
| ner," will certainly meet with an
| enthusiastic reception.
1 "Of Thee I Sing" is the first musi
j cal comedy to have ever been
granted the famous Pullitzer prize,
and it is through the personal per- j
i mission of George Kaufman, one of j

(sented. It is still enjoying a sensa-
I tional run in New York where it is
} breaking all attendance records.
