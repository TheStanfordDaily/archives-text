# Improvements Added To Quad Electric Facilities
## 
### 
Additional work in rearranging |
the electrical distribution system on !
the Stanford Quad is being under- !
taken at present by University em
ployees, following a survey showing I
the power facilities to be inade
quate.
According to figures on file in the j
office of Comptroller Almon E. Roth,
$4,320 was spent last year in com
pleting one-half of the new elec
trical unit. No estimate has been
furnished as yet for this year's work, â€¢
but the figure is expected to ap
proximate last year's total.
A survey of actual electrical fix
tures has been undertaken by Leo
Gianini, instructor in electrical en
gineering, and is expected to result i
in a number of changes in the cam- !
pus lighting arrangement. Gianini's j
check-up has thus far been con-j
fined to the Library and citizenship i
reading room.
