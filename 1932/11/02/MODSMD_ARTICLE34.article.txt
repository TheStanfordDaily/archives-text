# Indian Soccer Eleven Meets San Mateo Here Today
## MALONEY'S TEAM HOPES TO BREAK TIE OF FIRST TILT Shifted Lineup Possesses Potential Power To Crush Bulldogs 
### 
Reorganized and possessed of po- j
tential scoring power for the first j
time this season, Coach Harry Ma
loney's varsity soccer squad goes up
against the San Mateo Bulldogs this i
afternoon and will endeavor to make ;
up for the tie game played with !
the junior college eleven earlier this |
year.
S;in Mateo is no set-up. They '
have a victory over California to j
their credit, but if the Stanford team '
of two weeks ago could get a tie !
with this outfit, the squad that ;
represents Stanford tomorrow should j
he able to pick up a comfortable I
margin of victory.
Breaks May Decide
Conjectures and newspaper dope {
do not win games, however, and al- |
though Coach Maloney feels that j
his forwards are functioning as a i
unit, their ability to pound in win- j
ning goals today cannot be ascer- !
tained beforehand. Bad breaks, such
as occurred in the San Jose State j
encounter, poor judgment, or the i
"stage-fright" which has been the I
constant menace of the team so far i
can turn the tide of victory in the |
opposite direction. â€¢
The fact remains, nevertheless, |
that the forward wall showed last i
night a certain scoring ability and j
can play heady ball. They pounded j
a couple of goals past the goalie in
a scrimmage with the second string
and all in all gave a well rounded
performance.
Twenty-four Men Out
Maloney has finally gotten a defi
nite line-up on his first two teams,
and he will have twenty-four men j
on the field or on the bench today, i
the extra men being in the halfback !
and fullback positions.
Art Hearn will open the game in j
the key center forward position, j
with Cy Johnson at inside right and j
Al Velarde on the left side of him. j
Velarde is a former San Mateo boy j
himself, and is well acquainted with j
the type of ball played by the jun- j
ior college.
Knecht Is Veteran
Stanford is fortunate in having i
as capable a man as Carl Knecht at j
outside left. A veteran from last ]
year's team, Knecht has by far ex- J
eeeded his 1931 form, which was j
good enough to give him the first I
string spot at that time. Laurie j
Washburn, who has been tossed )
about in various positions, seems to
be finally settled at outside right.
Maloney will start Spohr, Ken- j
nedy, and White as halfbacks; but j
he lias Dunning, Nicoll, Strause, and '
Hitchcock to keep in reserve. Ken
nedy and Nicoll are the men who
play the center half's role.
King at Goal
Captain Brekelbaum heads the
list of fullbacks, with Nif Branch
starting as his running mate, and
Bill Krumbein ready to alternate
with Branch. Jack King will start
in the goal, but Milt Newman will
undoubtedly see action.
The rest of the roster will be
made up of Dodington, Sutow, Em
eriek, Rojas, and Viguie, forwards,
and Steele and Leven, fullbacks.
Game starts at four o'clock.
