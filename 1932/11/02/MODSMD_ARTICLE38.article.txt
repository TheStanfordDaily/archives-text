### 
WITH TWO TOUGH (JAMES |
BEHIND him, both sporting the
opponents' hue, and another one
coming up this week-end, Coach
Glenn Scobcy Warner ordered
his first string to keep away
from the practice field this week
until it felt fit again, and went
about the task of developing
material which has suffered
somewhat from lack of his own
supervision.
Warner is expecting to use the i
first string Satui'day against the |
Washington Huskies, but naturally \
he would rather have the second- ;
land third-string men bear the brunt 1
| ol' the attack if they are equal to it.
Coach Jimmie Phelan is bringing i
; the best team he has yet turned out |
| at the Seattle institution, and it is a ;
j pretty well-known fact that if they |
fail to bring home the bacon they !
' will have a new coach next year.
Phelan came to Washington from ]
j Purdue, after he had piloted the
i Boilermakers to a Big Ten Confer- j
! ence championship. He arrived amid
| much fanfare of trumpets, and j
; reams of publicity on what he would
! do to bring the Huskies the top rung ;
! on the Paciiic Coast football ladder. ]
I So far, Phelan has failed to do i
j much, and although he admittedly
j has a fuie outfit this year, the
j Seattle alumni are all in favor of I
I winning games, not making a good !
j showing.
This is the third team in a
row that has pointed for Stan
ford and Phelan will not have
much to say in his own defense
i if he doesn't return home with
a duplicate of U.C.L.A.'s triumph
over the much-battered Indians.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE
who haven't seen any roster of the
University of Washington football
i squad, we offer a few of the follow
ing names, so that you can spend
the rest of the week trying to get
them into the old skull: Ted Isaac
son, 263 pounds of tackle, and able
to get around quite nicely, thank
you! Wiatrak, his running mate, who
tips the Fairbanks at a mere 195, and
supposed to be one of the best on
thhe coast. Colin Howard, center,
Captain Bill O'Brien, left guard*
who both played great games
against the Cards last, year. Dave
"Poison" Nisbet and Bill Smith,
John Bunn's selections for All-
Coast ends. Johnny Cherberg,
three-year veteran at quarterback,
Burl Bufkin, left half, Mat Muc
j zynski, right half, and Paul Sul
| kosky, fullback.
j Muczynski and Sulkosky are re
! ported to be harder to stop than
I their names are to pronounce, and
[ they are only sophomores. Bufkin
i is a passer and kicker, as well as a

sweet ball-packer. Cherberg is I
known as one of fhe best signal |
barkers in the business, and he has j
been primed all season for the j
Stanford game.
If the Washington line can
push the Indian forwards back j
fast enough to prevent Warner's
spinners from getting started,
there will probably be more j
wailing and gnashing of teeth
around the Farm next Saturday
night, but if the Huskies turn
out to be bigger than they are
smooth, the Old Fox will prob
ably turn in his second confer- j
ence victory.
There is little that one can do
but wait and hope.
IT WAS DISTINCTLY en
couraging to see Here Labordc
and Bob Maentz tearing up and
down the sidelines last night as
if they were ready and waiting
to get into any game anywhere.
Stanford has a lot of fine half
backs this year, but this boy
Maentz seems to have more all
around ability than any of
them.
He was a power on offense, and \
a stone wall on defense during the !
short time that he played this year. j
For Stanford to have a man that j
can be counted on never to let any j
passer slip behind him while he is j
bolstering up the line, might be the
spark that would set the Indian on '
the victory trail.
The Cards can't lose many more
games with the material at hand
and still escape a lot of outside erit
-1 icism, which does little good to the
j powers that be or the boys under
! them.
Let's hope that the team rest up
i enough to win the remaining con
} ference battles without too much
; luck, and with a lot of real football.

WITH TWO TOUGH (JAMES |
BEHIND him, both sporting the
opponents' hue, and another one
coming up this week-end, Coach
Glenn Scobcy Warner ordered
his first string to keep away
from the practice field this week
until it felt fit again, and went
about the task of developing
material which has suffered
somewhat from lack of his own
supervision.
Warner is expecting to use the i
first string Satui'day against the |
Washington Huskies, but naturally \
he would rather have the second- ;
land third-string men bear the brunt 1
| ol' the attack if they are equal to it.
Coach Jimmie Phelan is bringing i
; the best team he has yet turned out |
| at the Seattle institution, and it is a ;
j pretty well-known fact that if they |
fail to bring home the bacon they !
' will have a new coach next year.
Phelan came to Washington from ]
j Purdue, after he had piloted the
i Boilermakers to a Big Ten Confer- j
! ence championship. He arrived amid
| much fanfare of trumpets, and j
; reams of publicity on what he would
! do to bring the Huskies the top rung ;
! on the Paciiic Coast football ladder. ]
I So far, Phelan has failed to do i
j much, and although he admittedly
j has a fuie outfit this year, the
j Seattle alumni are all in favor of I
I winning games, not making a good !
j showing.
This is the third team in a

much to say in his own defense

a duplicate of U.C.L.A.'s triumph
over the much-battered Indians.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE
who haven't seen any roster of the
University of Washington football
i squad, we offer a few of the follow
ing names, so that you can spend
the rest of the week trying to get
them into the old skull: Ted Isaac
son, 263 pounds of tackle, and able
to get around quite nicely, thank
you! Wiatrak, his running mate, who
tips the Fairbanks at a mere 195, and
supposed to be one of the best on
thhe coast. Colin Howard, center,
Captain Bill O'Brien, left guard*
who both played great games
against the Cards last, year. Dave
"Poison" Nisbet and Bill Smith,
John Bunn's selections for All-
Coast ends. Johnny Cherberg,
three-year veteran at quarterback,
Burl Bufkin, left half, Mat Muc
j zynski, right half, and Paul Sul
| kosky, fullback.
j Muczynski and Sulkosky are re
! ported to be harder to stop than
I their names are to pronounce, and
[ they are only sophomores. Bufkin
i is a passer and kicker, as well as a

sweet ball-packer. Cherberg is I
known as one of fhe best signal |
barkers in the business, and he has j
been primed all season for the j
Stanford game.
If the Washington line can
push the Indian forwards back j
fast enough to prevent Warner's
spinners from getting started,
there will probably be more j
wailing and gnashing of teeth
around the Farm next Saturday
night, but if the Huskies turn
out to be bigger than they are
smooth, the Old Fox will prob
ably turn in his second confer- j
ence victory.
There is little that one can do
but wait and hope.
IT WAS DISTINCTLY en
couraging to see Here Labordc
and Bob Maentz tearing up and
down the sidelines last night as
if they were ready and waiting
to get into any game anywhere.
Stanford has a lot of fine half
backs this year, but this boy

push the Indian forwards back j
fast enough to prevent Warner's
spinners from getting started,
there will probably be more j
wailing and gnashing of teeth
around the Farm next Saturday
night, but if the Huskies turn
out to be bigger than they are
smooth, the Old Fox will prob
ably turn in his second confer- j
ence victory.
There is little that one can do
but wait and hope.
IT WAS DISTINCTLY en
couraging to see Here Labordc
and Bob Maentz tearing up and
down the sidelines last night as
if they were ready and waiting
to get into any game anywhere.
Stanford has a lot of fine half
backs this year, but this boy
Maentz seems to have more all
around ability than any of
them.
He was a power on offense, and \
a stone wall on defense during the !
short time that he played this year. j
For Stanford to have a man that j
can be counted on never to let any j
passer slip behind him while he is j
bolstering up the line, might be the
spark that would set the Indian on '
the victory trail.
The Cards can't lose many more
games with the material at hand
and still escape a lot of outside erit
-1 icism, which does little good to the
j powers that be or the boys under
! them.
Let's hope that the team rest up
i enough to win the remaining con
} ference battles without too much
; luck, and with a lot of real football.

WITH TWO TOUGH (JAMES |
BEHIND him, both sporting the
opponents' hue, and another one
coming up this week-end, Coach
Glenn Scobcy Warner ordered
his first string to keep away
from the practice field this week
until it felt fit again, and went
about the task of developing
material which has suffered
somewhat from lack of his own
supervision.
Warner is expecting to use the i
first string Satui'day against the |
Washington Huskies, but naturally \
he would rather have the second- ;
land third-string men bear the brunt 1
| ol' the attack if they are equal to it.
Coach Jimmie Phelan is bringing i
; the best team he has yet turned out |
| at the Seattle institution, and it is a ;
j pretty well-known fact that if they |
fail to bring home the bacon they !
' will have a new coach next year.
Phelan came to Washington from ]
j Purdue, after he had piloted the
i Boilermakers to a Big Ten Confer- j
! ence championship. He arrived amid
| much fanfare of trumpets, and j
; reams of publicity on what he would
! do to bring the Huskies the top rung ;
! on the Paciiic Coast football ladder. ]
I So far, Phelan has failed to do i
j much, and although he admittedly
j has a fuie outfit this year, the
j Seattle alumni are all in favor of I
I winning games, not making a good !
j showing.
This is the third team in a
row that has pointed for Stan
ford and Phelan will not have
much to say in his own defense
i if he doesn't return home with
a duplicate of U.C.L.A.'s triumph
over the much-battered Indians.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE
who haven't seen any roster of the
University of Washington football
i squad, we offer a few of the follow
ing names, so that you can spend
the rest of the week trying to get
them into the old skull: Ted Isaac
son, 263 pounds of tackle, and able
to get around quite nicely, thank
you! Wiatrak, his running mate, who
tips the Fairbanks at a mere 195, and
supposed to be one of the best on
thhe coast. Colin Howard, center,
Captain Bill O'Brien, left guard*
who both played great games
against the Cards last, year. Dave
"Poison" Nisbet and Bill Smith,
John Bunn's selections for All-
Coast ends. Johnny Cherberg,
three-year veteran at quarterback,
Burl Bufkin, left half, Mat Muc
j zynski, right half, and Paul Sul
| kosky, fullback.
j Muczynski and Sulkosky are re
! ported to be harder to stop than
I their names are to pronounce, and
[ they are only sophomores. Bufkin
i is a passer and kicker, as well as a

sweet ball-packer. Cherberg is I
known as one of fhe best signal |
barkers in the business, and he has j
been primed all season for the j
Stanford game.
