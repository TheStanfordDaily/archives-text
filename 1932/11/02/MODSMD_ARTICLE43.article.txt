Variety was the essence of the
results in the intramural football j
menu yesterday afternoon. The grid \
squad from El Toro wiped out the
Japanese Club defense and pushed
over a 39 to 0 triumph, the Delta
Tau Delta team launched a final
offense in the last two minutes of
play against the men from Theta Xi
to win a G-0 game, and the Business
School forfeited the game with El
Capitan.
Equalling the season's record for
the greatest number of points per
game, El Toro found little trouble
in bowling over the Japanese Club
squad. Gene Mires of Toro scored
the initial touchdown with his 20-
yard run around end. Bill Morse on
a 20-yard pass from Jim Triolo ran
30 yards to the second touchdown.
With Triolo passing again, Mires
made 40 yards and another score.
He tallied the extra point with a
run around end.
Toro Passes Win
Toro's passing attack was func- :
tioning in A-l style with Triolo on |
the heaving end. On a pass from j
Triolo, Fisher made 70 yards to an- j
other touchdown for the men from 1
Toro. Roy Hanley ran around end j
for the conversion point. Triolo in
tercepted a pass on the Japanese
Club 40-yard marker and raced to
the fifth score of the game. He
plunged through center for the ex
tra point. A pass from Triolo and a j
run by Mires accounted for 40 yards j
and the final touchdown.
With the Toro line playing a stel
lar defensive game, Triolo and 1
Mires perfected their scoring busi- |
ness. Nakayama of the Japanese j
Club starred.
Last-Minute Win
In the Delt-Theta Xi game, the
twq teams played an even game i
until the last two minutes of the
battle. A march down the field by
the men from the Delt house fea
tured by a pass from Slilleson to
Bartlett to Johnson brought the ball
deep into the Theta Xi territory.
Then, on a ".sleeper" play with a
pass from Stilleson, Bartlett ran to
the lone touchdown. The pass for
the conversion point failed. Hall and
Lucey starred for Theta Xi.
Because the Business School squad
failed to appear at the scheduled
time, El Capitan won by default.
