# FROSH RESERVES PLAY LOWELL IN BATTLE SATURDAY
## Eliot Jones, Former Paly High Star, To Play Against Lowell 
### Dave Cooke 
While Stanford's first string Frosh
team is playing at Berkeley Satur
day in their annual "Little Big
Game," a team of reserve players
will clash with Lowell High on the
Gray field at 11:30. This game will
give substitute players a chance to
show their ability for the first time
during the season.
The probable Indian lineup for
the game will be: Wandries, center;
Martin and Dole, guards; Boswell
and Wetmore, tackles; Jones and
DeVeuve, ends; Rolph, quarter
back; Mc√üoth and McMichael, half
backs; Sears, fullback.
This will be the first opportunity
for local fans to see several local
prep stars in action. Eliot Jones,
playing left end, starred for Paly
; High last year. DeVeuve and Rolph
| played for Lowell in 1931 while
i Sears held down a fullback posi
! tion at Vallejo High.
So far Lowell's record has not
! been impressive owing to the in
i jury of several backfield men. Sat
j urday's game should be a close one
with the Frosh holding a slight ad
! vantage. For the first time in many
i years Lowell is not in the running
I for the A.AA. title.
Coach "Chuck" Winter bum put
the squad through a light work
out yesterday stressing the funda
mentals of blocking and calling sig
nals. With the final game of the
season scheduled for next Saturday,
heavy scrimmage is over for the
year.
