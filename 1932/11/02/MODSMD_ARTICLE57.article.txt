# Water Wagon Back On Farm
## 
### 
Stanford's water wagon is back
on the Farm!
The red and white rubber-tired
vehicle, which was stolen from the
Stanford Stadium by hilarious root
ers at the end of the Big Game last
year, has been reconditioned by the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of ( alifornia, and was delivered
to the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control in time to be used at the
U.S.C.-Frosh game last week.
Stripped of all its nickle-plated
gadgets, its hose nozzles, its pressure
tank, and in fact anything that could
be removed by souvenir huntei's
without the aid of a blow-torch, the
little white wagon was set up in
front of Wheeler Hall last year in
the hopes that its possession would
assuage the loss feit after Stanford
regained the Axe.
But Bear student body moguls
decreed otherwise, and 45 hours of
work, coupled with $85 spent for
new materials from the East, where
expended to restore the Stanford
cart to its original $400 condition.
