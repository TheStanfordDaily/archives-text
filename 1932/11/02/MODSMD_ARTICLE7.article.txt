# GAIETIES MUSIC LEADERS CHOSEN
## Directors Williams, Heche Ask Tunes, Lyrics 
### 
Doubly good musical entertain
ment for the 3932 Big Game Gaieties
is assured with the announcement j
of Gordon Heche and Grif Williams j
as co-directors of the musical end j
of the program. Heche is remem
bered as the musical head of last j
year's Junior Opera, "Two's Com- '
pany," and he is the conductor of a '
popular campus group of musicians. ;
Williams is the pianist of Anson j
Weeks' Mark Hopkins Orchestra,
and director of the Hotel Mark Hop- \
kins Orchestra which is to be fea- !
tured at the Sophomore Cotillion.
The orchestra which will provide |
music for the Ram's Head Gaieties j
is that of Jim Mohler, regarded as j
one of the best campus aggrega- !
tions. Mohler's sketch, "She's Got
Athlete's Foot," was one of the most ;
popular items on last year's Gaieties !
program.
All campus song writers are urged
to submit their original work, j
whether in connection with an i
"idea" or not. Those who have!
written only a tune may submit that j
to one of the musical directors, who i
will find a lyricist.
Those in charge are also in search '
of clever ideas for chorus numbers
and specialty acts, including either
solo or group dances, songs, or piano
acts. The initial hearing of all ma- I
terial will be from 3 to 5:30 o'clock |
in the Little Theatre on Friday af- ,
ternoon.
