I talk in Hoover's home town. "We ,
i are the center of the United States ;
i these days, at least I may say that j
| the eyes of the nation are focussed j
| on Palo Alto today. This city will be ,
a great deciding factor in the near
i ing elections." A tremendous burst j
>of applause followed.
Lauds Hoover

[ "The President is a man with a
I degree of resoluteness that never |
flinches or stirs, even when every- |
one els£ has given up ... . Hoover i
is not only famed for what he has j
done, but almost equally as much i
for what he has prevented . .
Comparing the two major candi- •
dates, Rowell asserted that Roose- i
velt is a very blithe and cheery j
person, but perhaps not as happy j
as tiie "higher-ups" who pull the 1
strings would have the public think |
the Democratic candidate is!

dress, Kathleen Norris, famed au- j
thoress and former resident of Palo |

ute talk. She informed the assembly !

"A tremendous number of people !
all up and down the state are surg- I

hundreds and thousands of new I
friends each time he speaks on the '
radio programs. There is no Ameri- |
can, no man, more fitted, more eager
to serve his country and his people." j
A huge crowd of local Hooverites, i
including a majority of Stanford j
students, were present at the rally j
