# HUSKIES HOPE 10 AVENGE PAST CARD VICTORIES
## Phelan Must End Stanford 7-Year Winning Streak Over Washington INJURY LIST SMALLER Laborde, Doub, Bates Able To Start Game 
### Dick Rodda 
Although Stanford is once again
in the favorite role for the coming
Saturday game, the Washington
Huskies will invade the farm with
the best chance of upsetting the
Cards since 1925. As the game draws
near, it becomes increasingly ap
parent that this is not a mere con
jecture because:
I.—The Cards have dropped two
conference games in a row, and this
week no one would be surprised to
see them lose the third.
2. —Jimmy Phelan, Washington
mentor, has the best material and
the best squad that he has coached
since he came to the Seattle institu
tion three years ago.
Phelan Must Be Redeemed
3.—The Huskies are particularly
anxious to lick the Cards so that
they will redeem their coach who
has been the target for much criti
cism of late because of the under
dog position maintained by Wash
ington in the coast conference.
4.—The Cards are playing the
third tough conference game in as
many weeks and just as in the
Bruin game last Saturday at Los
Angeles, they may not have fully
recovered from the jirevious week's
battle.

And so Pop Warner polished off
his offense last night in a mild
scrimmage at the close of which he
announced his strongest lineup pos
sible believing that it will be power
ful enough to prevent Washington
from scoring such an upset. With
the exception of Bill Doub at right
end in place of Jay Tod, Warner's
starting eleven is identical to the
one that faced the Trojans two
weeks ago.
Haker May Start
There is the possibility of one
change, however, in the backfield.
Jack Hillman was injured last week
at Los Angeles and although he is
improving rapidly enough to be in
shape by Saturday, Warner may de
cide in the last minute to send in
Phil Baker at the fullback post.
Baker played a whale of a game
last week; so whether or not he
starts, lie will see plenty of action
against the Huskies.
The remaining Card injuries which
were divided up between Bates,
Albertson, Labordc, and Doub have
healed satisfactorily. The condition
of Laßorde is the best it has been
for three weeks.
Despite the fact that the Huskies
have tied one and lost one in con
ference play, they are just as strong
as reports have indicated. They took
it on the chin a couple of weeks ago
from California but outplayed the
Bears in statistics. Again when they
fought to a scoreless tie with Ore
gon, they were the winners on the
chart. The rest of their contests
they have won by impressive scores.
