# BRITISH HUNGER MARCHERS QUIT LONDON, BEATEN
## 2000 Jobless Leave Capital Without Disorder When Police Block Aims 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 2 (JP).—After the
first contingents of the 2,000 "hun
ger marchers" who swarmed into
London last week from all parts of
the United Kingdom were started
homeward tonight the mystery of
what happened to their petition pur
portedly bearing one million names
was solved.
The petition demanded abolition of
the means test, which limits dole
beneficiaries and which never
reached the House of Commons as
was intended, was confiscated by po
lice when they learned it had been
checked in the Charing Cross rail
way station.
Alms House Riots
The only disturbance today, in
volving "hunger marchers" was one
in which they denied all responsi
bility. About 300 police were sent
to a London county alms house to
quiet a demonstration by inmates
who were aroused because of extra
food given to "hunger marchers"
stationed there. The latter received
the extra food from sympathizers.
They denied any part in the demon
strations and said they had shared
food with the regular inmates.
The police ordered the "hunger
marchers" to remain in their rooms
at the institution. Twenty-seven
men were arraigned in court today
on charges of participation in the
rioting last night on Whitehall and
the Embankment near the Houses
of Parliament and in the vicinity
of Charing Cross. Two were sen
tenced to six months at hard labor,
several others were fined and some
of their cases were held over for
a week.
Forty-Four Injured
An official casualty list was issued
by which it was stated 12 policemen
and 32 unemployed and sympathi
zers were injured in the riots of the
past few days. Forty-one arrests
were reported including W. A. L.
Hannington, Communist leader of
the "hunger army."
Police arrested a youth at Hamp
stead when they found him loitering
on the grounds of Prime Minister
Mac Donald's home near there. The
police said they found the youth,
Ivan Seruva, carrying bricks under
his arms. The premier rarely uses
his home there when Parliament is
in session, but it was believed he
might have been there last night
owing to disturbance in the vicinity
of his official residence.

who were aroused because of extra
food given to "hunger marchers"
stationed there. The latter received
the extra food from sympathizers.
They denied any part in the demon
strations and said they had shared
food with the regular inmates.
The police ordered the "hunger
marchers" to remain in their rooms
at the institution. Twenty-seven
men were arraigned in court today
on charges of participation in the
rioting last night on Whitehall and
the Embankment near the Houses
of Parliament and in the vicinity
of Charing Cross. Two were sen
tenced to six months at hard labor,
several others were fined and some
of their cases were held over for
a week.
Forty-Four Injured
An official casualty list was issued
by which it was stated 12 policemen
and 32 unemployed and sympathi
zers were injured in the riots of the
past few days. Forty-one arrests
were reported including W. A. L.
Hannington, Communist leader of
the "hunger army."
Police arrested a youth at Hamp
stead when they found him loitering
on the grounds of Prime Minister
Mac Donald's home near there. The
police said they found the youth,
Ivan Seruva, carrying bricks under
his arms. The premier rarely uses
his home there when Parliament is
in session, but it was believed he
might have been there last night
owing to disturbance in the vicinity
of his official residence.
LONDON, Nov. 2 (JP).—After the
first contingents of the 2,000 "hun
ger marchers" who swarmed into
London last week from all parts of
the United Kingdom were started
homeward tonight the mystery of
what happened to their petition pur
portedly bearing one million names
was solved.
The petition demanded abolition of
the means test, which limits dole
beneficiaries and which never
reached the House of Commons as
was intended, was confiscated by po
lice when they learned it had been
checked in the Charing Cross rail
way station.
Alms House Riots
The only disturbance today, in
volving "hunger marchers" was one
in which they denied all responsi
bility. About 300 police were sent
to a London county alms house to
quiet a demonstration by inmates
who were aroused because of extra
food given to "hunger marchers"
stationed there. The latter received
the extra food from sympathizers.
They denied any part in the demon
strations and said they had shared
food with the regular inmates.
