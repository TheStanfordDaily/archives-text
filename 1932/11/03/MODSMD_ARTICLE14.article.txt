### 
Initial tryouts for the 1932 Ram's
Head Big Game Gaieties will be
held at 1:45 o'clock this afternoon
in the Assembly Hall. At this time
all chorus and dancing numbers will
be viewed, and first steps will .be
made toward the assimilation of the
Big Show.
The numbers presented tomorrow
may be any type of dancing actsâ€”
the regular large chorus, the small
comic chorus, individual tap or soft
shoe numbers, or any specialty acts.
Kelly to Direct
Adelaide Kelly, former Stanford
student, is to be director of all
dancing for the Gaieties. Miss Kel
ly was connected with the highly
successful 1928 Big Game Gaieties,
and has subsequently had valuable
experience in New York. The co
directors of the musical end of the
program will also be present at the
selection of dance numbers this
afternoon.
All sketches and additional dance
numbers may be presented to the
committee from 3 to 5:30 o'clock to
morrow in the Assembly Hall.
Accept Sketches
Jack Redhead, president of
Ram's Head, announces that the
society still solicits the contribution
of additional sketches. The Gaieties
offers an opportunity for participa
tion of an unusually large number
of students, and the aim is to make
this year's show representative of
as many campus groups and activi
ties as possible.
