# Co-eds Less Democratic Says Billy The Shepherd
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Stanford's sheep are gone ... the
veteran sheep-herder is off the pay
| roll . . . but the profits of sheep
herding linger on.
William McCullought, better
' known as "Billy the Shepherd," is
retiring, now that the B.A.C. has
sold its flock of four-footed lawn
mowers, and no longer needs a care
taker for them.
Tlie advent of modern methods of
grass-cutting has not found Billy
napping. Exactly $10,000 in his bank
; account will take care of him for
j the rest of his days. He may live in
| Palo Alto; hi may travel East to
1 view New York and Washington.
Thirty-one years on the campus
gives Billy lots to reminisce about.
"Stanford students are less friendly
than they used to be." thinks Billy.

"I don't know whether it's because
they're less democratic or what, but
they sure have changed.
"Back before 1915 when I drove
the milk wagon that used to supply
all the campus and Palo Alto with
milk, Ihe Stanford girls used to wait
for me to pass on my route and get
i up on the wagon and ride with me.
j I don't suppose they do that sort of
thing nowadays. Why, even the gov
ernor's daughters, who were going
here then, used to ride.
"Perhaps I've changed more than
i the students. Maybe that's what
! makes things seem different. They
I used to have a lot (T good old
| fashioned fun in the old days, like
j going to Menlo for beer. Now they
j rot their stomachs with synthetic
1 gin."
