# STANFORD, U.C. ARGUE POLITICS IN HOT DEBATE
## Orators Of Both Schools Speak On Democratic, Republican Sides 
### 
In the first split debate in Stan- 1
ford history, six student speakers, ■
three of Stanford and three of the
University of California, earnestly
end ably presented the campaign
stands of the Democratic and Re
publican parties in the Assembly
Hall last night.
Professor Thomas Bailey, of the ,
local Department of History, opened
the debate by humorously suggest- :
ing that in such a close presidential j
race as the present, the speakers
might influence enough votes to de
cide the government's policies for !
the next four years. This might :
happen, he explained, because Cali
fornia was likely to be the pivotal ;
state of the campaign, and a few j
votes either way might change the j
state's vote, and therefore the elec- j
tion.
Moratorium Lauded
Ronald Kay, first Stanford .speak
er, explained in a quiet and con
versational style that he considered 1
the major issue of the campaign to '
be the constructive measures taken j
by Hoover for economic recovery.
He compared the Bay Bridge loan
of the R.F.C. with the post office ,
"pork barrel" bill of John Garner. '
He also pointed with pride to the
Hoover Moratorium and the Stim
son policy toward Japan.
Kay was answered in a humorous
and sarcastic vein by Salathiel Mas- |
terson of California, who recalled
President Hoover's statements that
what the country needed to end the j
depression was a good song, a good
joke, and a good poem
Bannister Replies
Wayne Bannister of the Indian ;
squad then replied that the enter- j
tainment which the Bear speaker ]
had provided was typical of the
campaign efforts of the Democratic j
party. He answered his opponent's :
sarcasm by deriding the Democratic j
farm program, and then explained :
the administration's farm board!
policy of encouraging farmers' co- j
operatives, and praised the flexible ,
provisions of the present tariff law. '
Another Stanford man, Franklin |
Gilchrist, proceeded to flay the Re- I
publican operation of the Recon- j
struction Finance Corporation, and j
declared that the depression was j
still "Hoovering around the corner." !
Roosevelt Praised
The third Hoover defender was j
Leroy Coburn, of California, who j
attacked the stand of his "former j
friends of California," as he termed j
his schoolmates. He expressed his I
disgust with what he termed the j
vilification of the President and his |
administration, and made an emo- j
tional appeal for sympathy for j
Hoover. He portrayed Roosevelt as |
a pleasant personality, who is '
vague, indefinite as to his plans. |
The last speaker, Donald Breyer, j
staged a fiery comeback at his fel
low Californian. He was the most j
forceful speaker of the evening. He j
cited the Roosevelt record in New ,
York, and compared it to the Hoover |
record.

low Californian. He was the most j
forceful speaker of the evening. He j
cited the Roosevelt record in New ,
York, and compared it to the Hoover |
record.
In the first split debate in Stan- 1
ford history, six student speakers, ■
three of Stanford and three of the
University of California, earnestly
end ably presented the campaign
stands of the Democratic and Re
publican parties in the Assembly
Hall last night.
Professor Thomas Bailey, of the ,
local Department of History, opened
the debate by humorously suggest- :
ing that in such a close presidential j
race as the present, the speakers
might influence enough votes to de
cide the government's policies for !
the next four years. This might :
happen, he explained, because Cali
fornia was likely to be the pivotal ;
state of the campaign, and a few j
votes either way might change the j
state's vote, and therefore the elec- j
tion.
Moratorium Lauded
Ronald Kay, first Stanford .speak
er, explained in a quiet and con
versational style that he considered 1
the major issue of the campaign to '
be the constructive measures taken j
by Hoover for economic recovery.
He compared the Bay Bridge loan
of the R.F.C. with the post office ,
"pork barrel" bill of John Garner. '
He also pointed with pride to the
Hoover Moratorium and the Stim
son policy toward Japan.
Kay was answered in a humorous
and sarcastic vein by Salathiel Mas- |
terson of California, who recalled
President Hoover's statements that
what the country needed to end the j
depression was a good song, a good
joke, and a good poem
Bannister Replies
Wayne Bannister of the Indian ;
squad then replied that the enter- j
tainment which the Bear speaker ]
had provided was typical of the
campaign efforts of the Democratic j
party. He answered his opponent's :
sarcasm by deriding the Democratic j
farm program, and then explained :
the administration's farm board!
policy of encouraging farmers' co- j
operatives, and praised the flexible ,
provisions of the present tariff law. '
Another Stanford man, Franklin |
Gilchrist, proceeded to flay the Re- I
publican operation of the Recon- j
struction Finance Corporation, and j
declared that the depression was j
still "Hoovering around the corner." !
Roosevelt Praised
The third Hoover defender was j
Leroy Coburn, of California, who j
attacked the stand of his "former j
friends of California," as he termed j
his schoolmates. He expressed his I
disgust with what he termed the j
vilification of the President and his |
administration, and made an emo- j
tional appeal for sympathy for j
Hoover. He portrayed Roosevelt as |
a pleasant personality, who is '
vague, indefinite as to his plans. |
The last speaker, Donald Breyer, j
staged a fiery comeback at his fel
low Californian. He was the most j
forceful speaker of the evening. He j
cited the Roosevelt record in New ,
York, and compared it to the Hoover |
record.
