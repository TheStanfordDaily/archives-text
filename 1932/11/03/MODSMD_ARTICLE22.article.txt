# Former Hoover Supporter Now Lauds Roosevelt
## Visiting Professor Stresses Executive Abilities 
### David Mellinkoff 
"I am an hereditary Republican.
| Four years ago my sentiments were:
i for Herbert Hoover. Today I cast my !
j vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt, j
: Governor of the State of New York." i
These are the words of Hugh Gal- j
' lagher, visiting associate professor I
of political science.
"For the last three years I have |
lived in the State of New York |
' under a Democratic governor, and j
I am firmly convinced that Roose- '
j velt is an expert and able adminis- !
j trator. Not only has he carried out!
the Smith progressive policies,'but |
he has added projects of his own.
Roosevelt Businesslike
"At the present time the State of i
| New York has the finest credit j
: foundation of any organization ex- j
| cept the Federal government. Roose- j
velt has run the State in a business- ;
like manner. He has been wise in
his choice of department heads.!
Civil service is of a high standard." j
Gallagher definitely clarified j
J Roosevelt's position in regard to the i
I stock market. "The Governor of!
I New York has absolutely no juris
[ diction over the New York Stock;
i Market. Roosevelt was inaugurated i
! Governor in 1929 and immediately j
!he undertook the regulation of the l
j public utility companies. Further
regulation of the holding companies j
j were included in his state policies. :
I But actual supervision of the Stock I
| Exchange is up to the Federal Gov- 1
! ernment."
Able Politician
The professor believes that both
j the candidates are well qualified for i
! the administrative ligors. But he j
! believes that a political organization I
\ should be headed by the more able j
! politician, in this case Roosevelt.
Spiking a whispering campaign to !
| the effect that William Randolph j
■ Hearst is the Democratic policy-dic- !
| tator, Gallagher said, "Hearst has i
] no influence over Roosevelt. If he,
1 did, the Smith-Baker opposition to j
I Hearst would completely offset any !
1 real political effect."
Gallagher, who attended both of |
! the conventions this summer and j
I who worked on the Wiekersham j
! Commission Report, concedes that j
Hoover will sweep the campus, just
jas Roosevelt will take the Hyde!
I Park district in New York. These,
j however, are merely local indica
tions. In the national field, he thinks,
[sentiment is slightly more favorable j
to Roosevelt.
