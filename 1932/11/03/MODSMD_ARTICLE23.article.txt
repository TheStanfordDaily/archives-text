# Row Presidents Vote To Permit 12 Pledges
## 
### 
By a 17-7 vote the house prcsi- j
I dents went on record at the Inter- ;
j fraternity Council meeting in the
j Old Union last night as favoring the
i increase of the pledge class allowed
leach fraternity from 10 to 12 men.
j Although the vote was decidedly in
I fi'Vor of the measure Ike Livermore,
| president, states that a strong min
i ority feeling exists.
I The Interfraternity Board of Con-
I trol will meet at 8 o'clock tonight in
j the Old Union to pass on the limita-
I tions recommendation of the Coun
! cil. The question of providing an
auditor to take care of the accounts
of all houses will probably come up
I for a decision, also.
