former years.
In attempting to create good will toward their dance, |
the sophomore committeemen have announced that roughs!
will be admitted to the Cotillion at midnight or there
abouts. That announcement still stands, but, in all fairness |
to the committee, prospective bid buyers should realize}
lhat the admittance of roughs will not affect the value of j
their bought-and-paid-for entertainment. Roughs will be
admitted as spectators, rather than as active participants!
in the terpisehorcan diversion.
