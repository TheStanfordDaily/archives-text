# IT WORKS!

Yesterday marked the first day of rushing under the |
new rules. For the first time in years, freshmen are allowed
to visit the houses during the fall quarter. This change of
policy enables the Row men to 14ct a better and saner idea
of what the individual freshmen are like. The general 1
feeling among the fraternity men is that the plan is work
ing out. Freshmen also seem to think that it is a success.
Many and rabid have been the blasts directed against;
the Intcrfraternity Hoard of Control in the past. It is
doubly pleasant, therefore, to offer praises for the excel-!
lenec of this year's set of rules.
Illegal rushing, and all the other malicious outgrowths!
of the old regulations, are apparently non-existant this
fall. I'lider this year's rulings, those petty offenses, such
as talking 011 the Quad, have been eliminated. The result
has been an increased respect for the few essential rules
that remain.
With this line start, backed up during rushing by strict
and unerring enforcement, this year's Hoard has a chance
to make historv to Hie credit of Stanford fraternities.
