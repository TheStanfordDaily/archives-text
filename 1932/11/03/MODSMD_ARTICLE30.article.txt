# BULL SESSION
## QUARANTINED LAUGHTER 
### 
j Tonight there will be much rau
j cous laughter in the Little Theatre
; when the campaign of John P. Win
tergreea for President is launched.
| The crowd will howl with unbiased
] avidity when his running-mate,
i Throttlebottom, is lost; and even
louder will be the merriment when
| once found, he is asked to go lose
I himself again. No, a new third party
i is not bding initiated. It is simply
the dramatic reading of "Of Thee I
1 by Sword and Sandals—one
j honorary that tries to be more than
i merely honorary.
_
All the students that are able to
i jam into the Little Theatre will en
! joy this political satire. Yet probably
| not one will consider applying that
] same laughter to the equally ridicu
lous situations that are splattered
I across the front pages of both Re
publican and Democratic news
papers. Yes, and Socialist papers are
just as funny. In fact, the real situ
ations are even more humorous be
cause they have the element of pity
attached to them.
During the summer we had an
unusual experience. In fact we had
many—but one in particular. In
veigled by a ten-year-old sister into
attending the village movie, we saw
the picture entitled "The Dark
Horse." It was a slap-stick take-off
on the political situation. One shot j
was the candidate fishing for trout ;
and of course votes before a battery ]
of news cameras. The audience j
roared with laughter. Half an hour !
later, in a regular news reel, a;
prominent campaigner was shown j
doing the same thing—rigged in a
very similar costume, and looking!

as equally unhappy as the actor.
Did the audience laugh at the pity
of the situation of a man forced to
don hip boots and cast a fly over
the troubled waters in the hope of
snagging thousands of unsuspecting
votes, and maybe one unsuspecting
trout? (The votes of course being
more important than the finny fish).
Absolutely not. They cheered. The
scene was the same; but the audi
ence saw no connection at all.
But not only will the laughter at
the satire as found in tonight's pre
sentation pour out to the Inner
Quad —unapplied and valueless; but
so will today's lectures in economics
and politics. At 10 o'clock in the
morning some underpaid economics
prof will labor over the theory of
international trade balances. At 10
o'clock in the evening the banal
sonorities of both parties will mud
dle the ether waves. Yet Rapaciovis
Republicans and Devouring Demo
crats will drink the stuff without
the least bit of intellectual nausea.
Who ever thinks of applying the
theories and facts of the classroom
to the theories and facts of the
positical platform? There is an in
surmountable, impregnable wall
separating the two realms. I have
yet to find the college student who
has had a traditional party alle
giance changed by his college edu
cation.
Laughter may be quarantined in
the Little Theatre—but laughter at
any place at any phase of political
bunkum and hoakum is valuable.
Some day it may break into the
open. —Abe Mellinkoff
