LA TRAVIATA—At the War Me
morial Opera House.
Verdi's most popular opera, pre
sented by an excellent cast, was a
fitting offering with which to con
clude the present season. Claudia
Muzzio as Violetta had some diffi
culty with the high notes in the
first act, but her other work was
almost flawless. Always a fine act
ress, she made this somewhat stiff
opera seem convincing; and she re
futed adequately the common ob
jection that no actress can sing the
last act and slill appear to be dying
of consumption.
However, first honors would go to
Richard Bonelli, for a performance
which climaxed a season of perfect
work. Di Provenza il Mar in the
second act was the high spot of the
opera. His remarkably smooth rich
voice lent to this situation of dra
matic irony a convincing pathos
seldom achieved. In the last two
acts he has very few lines, yet by
his excellent acting he developed
the character to its fullest extent.
Dino Borgioli as Alfredo was also
fine. He is invariably better toward
the end of an opera than at the
beginning; this time he began as
well as he usually ends, and by the
last act was in perfect voice. His
acting, usually mediocre, showed a
decided improvement-
Even the chorus rose to the occa
sion, keeping in time much better
than usual. Conductor Merola, how
ever, let the orchestra out too loud,
and as a result the voices of the
minor characters were drowned out
—no great misfortune by what was
heard of them. —Zimansky
"A SUCCESSFUL CALAMITY"
(Warners) —At the Varsity.
The most trivial of George A Hiss'
efforts to date, "A Successful Calam
ity" is not so successful as it might
be. It is an unconvincing yarn about
a multi-millionaire who finds pros
perity an obstacle to domestic feli
city and announces to his family
that he is ruined, with the result
that they gather around the fireside
and all ends well.
There are moments of the picture
which are delightful, and these por
tions make it good but not epochal
entertainment.
Here again George Arliss is given

j opportunity to portray a charming,
! polished, witty gentleman. The ac
| tor does so with customary charm
I and polish, and even more wit than
I usual. Like Will Rogers, Arliss is
always the same; yet perhaps it is
a tribute to his art that he can al
ways be just Mr. Arliss, whether
beneath powdered wig, turban, or
monocle, and call forth the high ac
claim and popularity from all.
Mary Astor has a limp part—that
! of the superficial wife who is almost
j unfaithful to her adoring husband
; —but her lovely appearance is an
I asset to any picture.
Berton Churchill does a good bit
as the butler, while Evalyn Knapp
and William Janney are very bad
indeed in juvenile roles. They do
| not seem able to decide whether the
| affair is farce or serious. —Chapin
