## CROSS COUNTRY? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Oil October 12, the Daiiy came out |
with the story that "cross country— J
the sport of lean leg muscles," etc., i
would be resumed this year as a |
regular sport, and that there would
be a run with California the week j
before the Big Game. Dink Temple- j
ton, who is now on the track again. !
was all for it. In fact he had Brutus
Hamilton, the U.C. coach, look over
the Stanford golf course in view of
using it for the runs, and both were
enthusiastic about it. The distance j
men, spurred to a frenzy of activity,!
donned spikes and tennis shoes and j
spent weeks running over the vari- j
cus roads and fields of the Farm to !
get in shape for the big event. At '
last the popular fall sport of cross i
country was to be resumed.
Every day the Indian tracksters j
have been out diligently working to i
perfect themselves in (he technique j
of following hard pavements, run- j
ning through the fields of tar weed, j
jumping ditches, and plodding up
hill and down—and for what?
Now, with no explanation, the
matter has been dropped. Every
thing was arranged by both schools,
both coaches were willing to coach i
the sport, and students from both j
the rival institutions were willing ■
to go out and do the hardest kind |
of work for the honor of their school i
and for the love of the sport.
Is all this energy and planning to j
be wasted? The Indian cinder path 1
artists want the sport. Interest in j
track at Stanford is not dead. It is |
alive! More men are turning out for j
intramural track this year than for j
many seasons. It is not the custom
of Stanford to initiate a really
worthwhile movement and drop it.
Why not make cross country a t
varsity sport and have that meet
between California and Stanford a |
week before the Big Game? The ,
Indian distance runners are ready
for it. We have the course. No cx- i
pensive equipment is necessary. Lei
us get behind this cross country as ;
a regular sport and make it a real- i
ity. It is time this popular collegiate |
sport should be again taken up on :
the Farm. The faithful men who are '
training every evening over the,
three- and four- and five-milej
courses should not be disappointed. 1

men, spurred to a frenzy of activity,!
donned spikes and tennis shoes and j

cus roads and fields of the Farm to !
get in shape for the big event. At '

country was to be resumed.
Every day the Indian tracksters j
have been out diligently working to i
perfect themselves in (he technique j
of following hard pavements, run- j
ning through the fields of tar weed, j
jumping ditches, and plodding up

Now, with no explanation, the
matter has been dropped. Every
thing was arranged by both schools,
both coaches were willing to coach i
the sport, and students from both j
the rival institutions were willing ■
to go out and do the hardest kind |
of work for the honor of their school i
and for the love of the sport.
Is all this energy and planning to j
be wasted? The Indian cinder path 1
artists want the sport. Interest in j
track at Stanford is not dead. It is |
alive! More men are turning out for j
intramural track this year than for j
many seasons. It is not the custom
of Stanford to initiate a really
worthwhile movement and drop it.
Why not make cross country a t
varsity sport and have that meet
between California and Stanford a |
week before the Big Game? The ,
Indian distance runners are ready
for it. We have the course. No cx- i
pensive equipment is necessary. Lei
us get behind this cross country as ;
a regular sport and make it a real- i
ity. It is time this popular collegiate |
sport should be again taken up on :
the Farm. The faithful men who are '
training every evening over the,
three- and four- and five-milej
courses should not be disappointed. 1
