# DISILLUSIONED

The Editor, Sir:
I am getting just a trifle disap
pointed in Stanford. I had come to j
school v/ith the general conception, I
prevalent in my part of the country,
that Stanford is superior, that its
students are the pick of the country.
Yesterday morning I sat in the As- t
sembly Hall trying to listen to Pro- ;
fessor Hulme's Cit lecture. A great :
number of frosh were not able to

appreciate the professor. You would
suppose that their social training
would assert itself and that they
would be respectful of the rights of
others and courteous to the lecturer.
Instead, this too-large group gave
one of the most disgusting exhibi
tions of disrespect I have ever wit
nessed. I heard outright boos and
mocking of the professor. Both men
and women took part in this com
mon exhibition. Is this representa
tive of the so-called democracy of
Stanford students? Is this a typical
example of the social training of
Stanford students? Is this the high
social standard of Stanford men and
women?
I have been partly disillusioned.
It may bo that Stanford students
are just as common as any other
group.
