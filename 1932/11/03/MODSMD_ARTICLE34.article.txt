# PH.D. FRENCH REVIEW
## 
### 
Candidates for the doctor's degree
will be offered a French course next
quarter to enable them to pass their
language examination. The course,
under the direction of Professor
William L. Schwartz of the Romanic
Languages department, is not a short
cut to French but a comprehensive
review for Ph.D. candidates.
