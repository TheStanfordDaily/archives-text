given students by a Boston Univer

you open it.
2. Enter with a pleasant look on |
your face.
3. Don't be the first to offer to'
shake hands.
4. Don't "pull up a chair" unless
you are asked to do so.
5. Try to be a good listener.
5u Don't show interest in /tele
phone conversations.
7. Don't punctuate what you have
to say with "See?" "Under
stand me?"
8. Don't stare about the office, but
do look about sufficiently so
that you may get out without
knocking over the hatrack.
