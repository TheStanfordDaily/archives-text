# Card Babes Favored Over Cal Frosh Saturday
## YEARLING GRIDMEN RATED STANFORD'S FINEST FOR YEARS Injuries Weaken Bear Cub Chances Of Breaking Through Line 
### 
i
Stafford's undefeated and untied
freshman football team goes to the I
wars on two gridiron fronts Satur- j
day.
i First,- second,- and third-string 1
; yearling players, comprising the best j
football material a Stanford fresh- j
man class has had in many years, j
will travel to Beikeley for the an- j
j nual "Little Big Game" with the
California freshmen. Fourth- and j
fifth-string players will remain on
the campus to play Lowell High
School.
The Indians are heavy favorites
to defeat the Bear Cubs, in spite
of defeats suffered at the hands of i
Berkeley's freshmen in 1930 and j
1931. Although the distinction is de- j
sej ved, Stanford's role of 3-1 favor- i
ite will not help her in the Memorial j
Stadium Saturday.
Stopped "Wonder Team"
California's 1931 freshman eleven j
was called the "wonder team"; it
swamped all opposition, while the j
Indians were suffering numerous!
setbacks. But the Bear Cubs won I
over last year's Papooses by the j
slenderest of marginsâ€”and only af- I
ter the Indian regulars wore re- j
placed by inadequate substitutes. |
Although their season has been j
overshadowed by Stanford's brilliant j
record, the Bear Cubs are still un- !
defeated. They were tied once, by 1
the same U.S.C. eleven that subse- i
quently lost to Stanford, 33-7. The |
' Bears were impressive against One
onta Military Academy, Pasadena
Junior College, and Armstrong;
Business College. All three of these j
contests were won by big scores, j
Against San Mateo and Compton j
Junior Colleges, the high-powered j
Bear running attack failed to get !
under way.
Injuries Take Toll
As if the Bear Cubs' chances of i
victory were not already slim !
enough, the California injury jinx j
has deserted Bill Ingram's varsity, !
and settled gloomily on the "under- j
dog" freshman players. j
California's best player, Fullback j
Frank Walker, will probably not be j
able to play. The former Polytechnic i
High School star is suffering a j
bruised leg and a strained Achilles I
tendon. Captain Floyd Blower, a j
heavy, damaging left halfback, is j.
favoring a mending sprained ankle, j
Blower will be lucky to last through j
the first half.
Positions Shifted
In the absence of Walker, Clint |
Evans has shifted Alvin Thorell to j
fullback, and Thorell's old quarter
back assignment will be shared ,
by Bill Herbert and Raymond Bot- j
tari.
Dave Potter, formerly of Lowell, j
and Willie Swabel, a speedy Pied
mont boy, will start at the halfback
positions.
Even in the best of health the !
Bear Cub backs would be outclassed j
by Stanford's quartet: Hoos, Hamil
ton, Grayson, and Alustiza. Beset by .
injuries as it will no doubt be Sat- j
urday afternoon, the California j
backfield will probably attempt an 1
I aerial game. They realize the hope- j
j lessness of trying to score through j
< Stanford's heavy and experienced
I line.
