With the first-string varsity rest
ing for its all-important game with
California tomorrow, Coach Buster
Holmes will send his frosh soccer
team up against the varsity reserves
in a regular game at 4:30 o'clock this
afternoon.
The frosh have nothing scheduled
until their little big-game with the
Bear frosh on November 12, and
today's scrimmage should give the
yearlings a severe test.
Suffering the same evil which
menaces the success of the varsity,
the frosh seem to lack a dependable
forward wall, but the fullbacks,
Huntsberger and Valentine, and the
goalie, Laird, can be counted upon
to keep the opponents' score down.
