## Hallmen Smother Chi Psi's 40 To 0; Cuadro Beaten In Last Minute 
### Dick Strouse 
i Good old Sequoia Hall crashed
j through late yesterday afternoon to
save a sad intramural touchball day
for the denizens of non-Row resi
dences. Previous to the 40 to 0 vic-
I tory over Chi Psi Lodge registered
by Sequoia If, the A.K.L.'s and the
j Sigma Chi's had bowled over an
j eating club apiece.
The Phi Betes from Alpha Kappa
| Lambda waited until the last min»-
jute of play before scoring the win
ning points against El Cuadro. Trail
-1 ing 12 to 0 at halftime, the Rowmen
j countered with 13 points in the sec
| ond half.
j Charlie Marple threw a 30-yard
i pass to Dick Thorup for the first
i A.K.L. touchdown, and then nothing
happened until the referee got tired
and announced that but a minute of
play remained. Marple and Thorup
i then got together again and scored,
i Rubel's drop-kick was goqd the sec-
I ond time.
Saunders Scores Twelve
Ed Saunders was instrumental in
: both Cuadro scores, receiving a pass
l from Ken Addicott for the first
j touchdown and intercepting an
1 A.K.L. aerial essay and galloping
| 75 yards for the second but insuffi
: cient club score.
Another Saunders, this one Rus
jsell Saunders, helped the Sigma
i Chi's defeat El Tigre 33 to 0. Appar
| ently thinking of the fraternity's
I sweetheart of lyric fame, Saunders
ran 17 yards for the first touchdown
and then drop-kicked the extra
point. Saunders to Payne Palmer
I and a nice run by Palmer accounted
! for the second score.
; Palmer and Bob Savinske teamed
up to score 14 points on various
passes and runs in the second half.
1 The busy Mr. Palmer threw a pass
to Metcalf for the last touchdown,
1 which was enough for El Tigre. Out
j standing for the losers were Hol
' comb and Shippey.
Sequoia Comes Through
Then came the sad defeat of Chi
1 Psi's lodgemen. Too much Bill
Ladue and too much class on the
J part of all the Sequoia men ran up
40 points while the Lodge failed to
| score.
Ladue to Russell for the first
touchdown and conversion; Ladue
on a 20-yard sprint around end and
j a drop-kick for the next seven
points;. Ladue to Wagnon for an
other; and then Ladue to Fisher,
! this one good 'for 50 yards. (Turn
! the page.)
Ladue on another 20-yard run
! after it nice run by Fisher and
Ladue to Russell for another extra
i point that was certainly extra in
that game. The day's work for Se
quoia ended with another Ladue to
; Wagnon score.
Bill Reppy used his track ability
to good effect as he led the Chi
I Psi's with Harry Kendall his most
proficient helper.
