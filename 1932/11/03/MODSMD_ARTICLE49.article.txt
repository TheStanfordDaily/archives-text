# FROSH 2-MAN TRACK TEAM HOPES FOR GRID ADDITIONS
## 
### JACK DROWN 
With only two men reporting I
regularly, Coach Bill Ellington's !
I freshman track team is marking
j time until the close of the yearling ,
i football season Saturday. Serious j
j practice will really commence next 1
j week when a large group of frosh '
I who have been participating in the ;
' gridiron sport are expected to turn !
out
j Although the team at the present ,
| time is lacking in quantity it does
j not want for quality. A high-jumper j
j who answers to the monicker of Don
I Albertsen makes up one-half of the
j duo, while a young fellow by the i
: name of Charlie Nimmo comprises
j the other half. Albertsen hails from
; Palo Alto High School and is cred
i ited with a leap of 5 feet ll 1 a inches
j in the lath event.
i Nimmo, whose specialty is the
j mile, comes from Hollywood, the
| "Home of the Stars." The boy is
; somewhat of a star himself, having
j run the four-lap event in the fine
j time of 4 minutes and 28 seconds
| while attending Hollywood High
! School.
j Chief among the prospects from
j the frosh football team who are ex
pected to don spikes are, Bob Rey
nolds. Hunt Kingsbury, and perhaps
Bob Grayson. Reynolds, who weighs
close to 215 pounds dripping wet, is
proficient with the weights and

should be a big addition to that de
partment. The timber-topping events
should be well taken care of by
Kingsbury, who boasts of a prep
school record of 14.9 seconds in the
high hurdles. If Grayson decides to
compete in the cinder events, the
team will have another hurdler of
no mean ability. Grayson is one of
the best prep-school athletes to
come from Oregon in several years
and is capable in most forms of
athletics.
No schedule of coming meets has
been drawn up as yet, but Coach
Ellington announced that the matter
will probably be attended to within
the next few weeks.

i Nimmo, whose specialty is the
j mile, comes from Hollywood, the
| "Home of the Stars." The boy is
; somewhat of a star himself, having
j run the four-lap event in the fine
j time of 4 minutes and 28 seconds
| while attending Hollywood High
! School.
j Chief among the prospects from
j the frosh football team who are ex
pected to don spikes are, Bob Rey
nolds. Hunt Kingsbury, and perhaps
Bob Grayson. Reynolds, who weighs
close to 215 pounds dripping wet, is
proficient with the weights and

should be a big addition to that de
partment. The timber-topping events
should be well taken care of by
Kingsbury, who boasts of a prep
school record of 14.9 seconds in the
high hurdles. If Grayson decides to
compete in the cinder events, the
team will have another hurdler of
no mean ability. Grayson is one of
the best prep-school athletes to
come from Oregon in several years
and is capable in most forms of
athletics.
No schedule of coming meets has
been drawn up as yet, but Coach
Ellington announced that the matter
will probably be attended to within
the next few weeks.
