# SOCCER MEN FAIL IN PINCHES, LOSE TO BULLDOGS 2-1
## San Mateo J.C. Has But 8 Shots At Goal To 24 For Stanford 
### Maurice Rapf 
Three goals in the third quarter
completed the scoring in the Stan-
I ford-San Mateo soccer game yester
day, but, unfortunately from a Stan
ford point of view, two of these
scores were registered by the junior
college kickers and the Bulldogs
won the game 2-1.
The same fault lost yesterday's
game that has been the mistake
of the Cards all year, namely the
inability to put the ball into the net
when right in front of the goal. The
halves and fullbacks were constant
ly sending the leather sphere right
up in scoring territory, but the for
wards could do nothing about it.
Cards Get 21 Shots
Statistics show that these for
wards took no less than 24 shots at
the goal, 19 of them before a score
was finally made. The San Mateo
booters got only eight cracks at the
goal, but made two of them good.
Stanford also had every break, be
ing given four corner kicks to San
Mateo's none, and six free kicks to
( three for the Bulldogs.
The first half ended in a scoreless
tie, but Stanford held the upper
hand (or is it foot?) throughout,
with the ball almost always in front
of the opposing g'oal. Time after
time the Indian forwards and halves
kicked the ball toward the net, but
these attempts either went astray
or were stopped by the Bulldog
goalie.
Maloncy Dissatisfied
At half-time, Coach Harry Ma
loney laced into the team as he
never has before. Disgusted, lie gave
I the forwards five minutes in which
| to snap out of their lull, threatening
j to remove all of them except Carl
Knecht, who played beautifully at
outside left. T'hree minutes of the
second half and San Mateo had
j taken a 1-0 lead. Two minutes later
i Hearn scored and evened matters,
j but Maloney, apparently rot yet
I satisfied with the play of the for
j wards, sent in Dodington for Wash
burn, Rojas for Velarde, and Viguie
for Johnson.
