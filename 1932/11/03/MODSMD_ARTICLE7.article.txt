# MOTIF CHOSEN FOR COTILLION
## Chrysanthemums, Subdued Lights To Dominate 
### 
Chrysanthemums combined with
subdued lighting effects will be the
dominant decorative note of the
Sophomore Cotillion, to be held from
9 to 1 o'clock tomorrow night in the
Women's Gymnasium. Distinctly
formal in character the decorative
scheme has been chosen to harmo
nize with the traditional formal con
ception of a cotillion.
Programs selected for the dance
are simple but striking in design,
consisting of a solid silver back
ground with the red Stanford seal
in one corner.
Vocal talent selected especially for
the Cotillion will be brought down
from San Francisco by Griff Wil
liams, along with his 13-piece Mark
Hopkins Hotel orchestra. Williams
and his orchestra have been asso
ciated with Anson Weeks for some
time and are a familiar and popular
group, both in the bay district and
on the Stanford campus.
Bids for the dance have been re
duced from $u.50, the price prevail
ing in former years, to $3, the lowest
ever charged for a Sophomore Cotil
lion. They can be secured from 8
to 5 o'clock both today and tomor
row at the A.S.S.U. offices in the
Old Union.
