SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3 (&).—
A. P. Nelson, Copperopolis rancher,
and his wife were at police head
quarters here today—in the Rogues'
gallery trying to identify photo
graphs of the two bunco artists they
say swindled them out of their life
savings of $7500 in Sacramento this
week.
Nelson told police he met "C.
Thompson and "J. C. Wainwright"
in San Jose several days ago to dis
cuss the possible purchase of his
Calaveras county ranch.
Later he said they induced him to
turn over all his money to them to
bet on a "sure thing" at the Tan
foran race track. The rancher de
clared the men received the $7500
at the Senator hotel in Sacramento
and then disappeared.
