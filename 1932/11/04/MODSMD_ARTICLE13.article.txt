# KAUFMAN PLAY READING PACKS LITTLE THEATRE
## Zimansky, Cathcart, Jones Star In Presenting "Of Thee I Sing" 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
John P. Wintergren and Mary
Turner were swept into the White
House by an avalanehe of laughter
that rocked the entire Little Theatre
last night, when Sword and Sandals
presented its reading of "Of Thee
1 Sing."
The Standing Room Only sign
wah hung out ten minutes before
starting time, and by the time the
curtains parted, the aisles, windows,
radiators, and everything but the
chandeliers were accommodating
people who laughed until they were
limp.
Pulitzer Prize Winner
The brilliant, satiric lines of Kauf
man's Pulitzer Prize play were
given splendid treatment at the
hands of the capable players who
read it. The greatest tribute to them
is that one forgot it was a reading,
forgot to wish for sets, make-up,
action, and orchestra. Only the
matchless humor of the play and
the exceptional work by several of
the readers stood out.
"Of Thee I Sing" pokes fun at
everything that America holds debr;
nothing is sacredâ€”the presidency,
Lincoln, Congress, prohibition, mat
rimony ,the vice-presidency, love,
and posterity (which is just around
the corner).
Rapid-Fire Mockery
This delightful spirit of mockery
was admirably caught by the read
ers. They maintained a rapid-fire
pace essential to the success of the
comedy, and only an occasional
smothering of laughs marred the
evening's smoothness.
Outstanding by reason of acting
as well as his role was Curt Ziman
sky as Alexander (Dill Pickle)
Throttlebottom, the vice-president
who returns to his hermit's cave
during the campaign but is thrown
out by the other hermits.
"A Man's Man's Man''
John P. Wintergreen, "A Man's
Man's Man." was read by Bob Cath
cart wit ha good deal of virility and
lots of ease. Marian Jones as Mary
Turner looked lovely and read
charmingly.
In the part of Diana Devereaux,
"the faihest flowah in all the Sawth,"
Barbara Collins again proved her
infallible ability as an actress.
Sandoe Heads Directions
Andy Harris, James McElney, and
Robert Dwan were more than ade
quate, and the rest of the cast was
likewise splendid.
James Sandoe, evidently enjoying
the affair as much as the audience,
gave a skilled reading of the direc
tions. The capable direction of Val
lejo Gantner merits highest praise.
