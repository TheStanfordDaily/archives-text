"Phi on the boys who don't have
their pictures taken today, de
clared the Quad photo editor when
he announced the daily schedule of
the Watson studio at 520 Salvatierra.
For the three houses slated are:
Phi Delta Theta
Phi Gamma Delta
Phi Kappa Psi
Business hours at the studio,
which is almost directly in the rear
of the S.A.E. house, remain at 9 to 12
and 1 to 4:30 o'clock. Collars, ties,
and dark coats still are essentials.
