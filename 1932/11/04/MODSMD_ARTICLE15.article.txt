According to Coach Leland Chap
in, Wilbur promises to be a power
ful speaker. He is in his senior
year in political science.
Joseph Wolf, who starred in the
recent dramatic production, "Death
Takes A Holiday," is an "old hand"
at the debating game. He has,
among other contests, debated with
the University of California, and
was the alternate for the Harvard-
Stanford encounter which was
broadcast over the nation l v ast year.
Cards Back Thomas, Hoover
In the clash with Fresno State
tonight, Bromley Smith will plead
the cause of the Socialist candidate,
Norman Thomas. His teammate,
Willard Thompson, will speak for
Hoover. Smith is a senior who de
bated here in his sophomore year,
and has since been studying abroad
for two years. Thompson was one
of the outstanding fiosh debaters
last year.
This Fresno State debate was er
roneously announced as taking
place Wednesday night. It provides
the longest trip for the squad dur
ing fall quarter.
These will be the last encounters
on the issues of the presidential
campaign. Since the U.S.C. contest
is on the eve of the election, Coaches
Chapin and William Hawley Davis
anticipate a large crowd. After the
election, the squad will most likely
return to the joint debate principle,
of allowing teammates to stand on
the same side of the argument,
rather than the present split-debate
plan, Chapin said.

According to Coach Leland Chap
in, Wilbur promises to be a power
ful speaker. He is in his senior
year in political science.
Joseph Wolf, who starred in the
recent dramatic production, "Death
Takes A Holiday," is an "old hand"
at the debating game. He has,
among other contests, debated with
the University of California, and

Cards Back Thomas, Hoover
In the clash with Fresno State
tonight, Bromley Smith will plead
the cause of the Socialist candidate,
Norman Thomas. His teammate,
Willard Thompson, will speak for
Hoover. Smith is a senior who de
bated here in his sophomore year,
and has since been studying abroad
for two years. Thompson was one
of the outstanding fiosh debaters
last year.
This Fresno State debate was er
roneously announced as taking
place Wednesday night. It provides
the longest trip for the squad dur
ing fall quarter.
These will be the last encounters
on the issues of the presidential
campaign. Since the U.S.C. contest
is on the eve of the election, Coaches
Chapin and William Hawley Davis
anticipate a large crowd. After the
election, the squad will most likely
return to the joint debate principle,
of allowing teammates to stand on
the same side of the argument,
rather than the present split-debate
plan, Chapin said.
Having successfully completed the
first four debates ot the fall season
on Wednesday night, the Stanford
debate squad is prepared to battle
Fresno State College tonight in
Fresno, and the University of
Southern California here in the
Little Theatre at 8 o'clock Monday
night.
Stanford will be pitting two of her
strongest debaters against her Tro
jan rivals. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr.,
will be the Stanford proponent of
the Hoover administration, while
Joseph Wolf will champion the
Democratic cause. No information
has yet been received as to the two
Trojan speakex*s.
