# Home Town Won't Look Familiar To President
## 
### Bob Letts 
| The old home town won't look the
same to President Herbert Hoover
when he arrives here next Tuesday
j to await returns of his political bat
| tie with Governor Franklin D.
I Roosevelt.
Since moving to the White House
I four years ago, he has Deen unable
i to visit his home town atop San
j Juan Hill and keep track of the
i more than two and one-quarter
j million dollar improvements that
| have been made in Palo Alto and
j cn the campus during his absence.
The old i"ed street cars that used
j to rattle between the depot and the
campus have been replaced by
modern motor busses. A new six
story hotel, worth $700,000, has been
built and named the "President
Hotel," in honor of Mr. Hoover.
Palo Alto Hospital, an imposing
modernistic brick structure valued
at $450,000, has taken the placc of
the old frame building. Work is now
J under way in Palo Alto on a new
! government post office to cost
$200,000.
Numerous new houses have
sprouted up to swell Palo Alto's

population to nearly 15,000, an in
crease of approximately 2,000 in the
last four years.
While Palo Alto has been busy
beautifying and enlarging its com
munity, Stanford has been making
rich improvements on the "Farm."
The President was graduated here
back in the 'nineties.
Most of the additions and innova
tions on the campus are connected
with athletics, although $1(>0.000 was
invested in doubling the size of the
Felt Lake dam, which impounds
one of the University's principal
water supplies.
Stanford's football stadium, where
nearly 90.000 flocked to hear Mr.
Hoover's acceptance speech four
years ago, has been reconditioned
with now seats and steps at a cost
of $100,000. The Stanford Board of
Athletic Control, whose financing
made possible many of the improve
ments, built itself a new adminis
tration building, for $105,000.
An 18-hole golf course, rated as
one of the most exacting in the
state, has been laid out on the
rolling hills among shaggy oaks and )
lowering eucalyptus trees for a j
figure of $1100,000.
The women's gymnasium, which j
is also used for numerous campus j
social affairs, cost $250,000 to erect. |
Swimming Pools Installed
One hundred th'ousand dollars |
was spent in the men's swimming
pools, completed last spring and al
ready has been the .scene of two
world's record-breaking times.
The sunken baseball field, larger |
than most major league parks and
said to be the finest college diamond .
anywhere, was finished a year ago ,
for $30,000.
And that's not all. Minor invest- !
ments have drawn several hundred j
thousand dollars more from the Uni- j
versity treasury. State public works, j
principally roads, are busy on the j
Bayshore and Foothill boulevards)
which will increase the number of
traffic arteries down the peninsula
to five. State gasoline taxes finance
these projects.
Air base Is Nearby
Sunnyvale airbase, five miles to |
the south, can almost be seen from ;
the front porch of the Hoover home, i
But in spite ol all these changes, j
the Hoover home will be the same— j
except for a few chips removed from j
its corners by souvenir hunters who j
escaped the eyes of guards.

The old i"ed street cars that used
