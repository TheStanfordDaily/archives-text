| The old home town won't look the
same to President Herbert Hoover
when he arrives here next Tuesday
j to await returns of his political bat

I Roosevelt.
Since moving to the White House
I four years ago, he has Deen unable
i to visit his home town atop San
j Juan Hill and keep track of the
i more than two and one-quarter
j million dollar improvements that
| have been made in Palo Alto and
j cn the campus during his absence.
The old i"ed street cars that used
j to rattle between the depot and the
campus have been replaced by
modern motor busses. A new six
story hotel, worth $700,000, has been
built and named the "President
Hotel," in honor of Mr. Hoover.
Palo Alto Hospital, an imposing
modernistic brick structure valued
at $450,000, has taken the placc of

While Palo Alto has been busy
beautifying and enlarging its com

rich improvements on the "Farm."
The President was graduated here
back in the 'nineties.
Most of the additions and innova

with athletics, although $1(>0.000 was
invested in doubling the size of the
Felt Lake dam, which impounds
one of the University's principal
water supplies.
Stanford's football stadium, where
nearly 90.000 flocked to hear Mr.
Hoover's acceptance speech four
years ago, has been reconditioned
with now seats and steps at a cost
of $100,000. The Stanford Board of
Athletic Control, whose financing
made possible many of the improve
ments, built itself a new adminis
tration building, for $105,000.
An 18-hole golf course, rated as
one of the most exacting in the
state, has been laid out on the
