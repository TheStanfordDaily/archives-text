# SOPH COTILLION BIDS LEFT FOR EVENT TONIGHT
## Chrysanthemums Furnish Decorative Theme For Formal 
### 
Bids for tonight's Sophomore
Cotillion are going rapidly, an
nounces the committee in charge,
and any students still wishing to
purchase them are urged to do so
immediately at the A.S.S.U. offices.
Reduced to meet with present price
levels, bids are being sold this year
for $3, the lowest price ever charged
for a Sophomore Cotillion.
Arrangements for tonight's dance,
to be held from 9 to 1 o'clock in, the
Women's Gymnasium, promise that
it will equal the standard set by
previous Cotillions, always consid
ered the leading social events of the
autumn quarters.
Williams' Band Plays
Music will be furnished by Griff
Williams and his 13-piece Hotel
Mark Hopkins second orchestra,
augmented by special vocal talent.
A well-known ensemble in the bay
district, Williams and his band will
also be remembered by Stanfordites
for their work at last year's Big
Game Jolly-up.
Chrysanthemums backed by sub
dued lighting effects will constitute
the Cotillion decorative theme, in
keeping with the formal character
of the dance. Programs are striking
but simple in design, consisting of a
solid silver background with the red
Stanford seal in one corner. They
may be secured either at the
A.S.S.U. office or at the door of the
Gym.
Roughs Admitted Free
Roughs will be admitted free after
12 o'clock, in keeping with a tradi
tion long followed at Stanford
dances.
Arrangements for the Cotillion
have been in charge of a committee
consisting of Charlotte Gibner, Ann
Rosener, Marvie Kahn, Alan Kel
sey, and Pete Peck and acting with
out a chairman. They have been
assisted by sophomore class officers
Ralph Staver, president; Marcia
Cass, secretary; and Ben Cave,
treasurer.
