# Boyles States Communism Is Economic Aid
## Immediate Aid To Workers Held Imperative 
### Paul Zuich 
Because of the vague notions pre
valent about the Communist Party
in the United States, Wallace Boyle,
'33, an economics major, consented
to outline a few of the issues pre
sented by the Communists in their
campaign to elect William Z. Foster
president.
Boyle stated that he first became
interested in the Communist pro
gram through contacts with foreign
students. Support of the Third In
ternationale is of course much more
common in Europe. The fact that
such American intellectuals as Lin
coln Steffens,, John dos Passos, and
Theodore Dreiser are adherents of
the Communist party shows that its
platform is becoming recognized in
this country. George Foster Pea
body, former banker and eminent
philanthropist, in a communication
to the New York Times, called for a
large protest vote for the Commun
ist candidates because of present
economic conditions.
Party Platform Quoted
In presenting the Communist case
Boyle quoted extensively from party
platform. "The Communist denies
that some sort of mystical evolution
called progress, assisted by a spirit
of benevolent reform, will even
tually do away with the glaring evils
and inequalities of the capitalist
system. He believes that it is a
gross inconsistency to hold that a
state whose every power is bent on
perpetuating the status quo, will
turn against itself to destroy the
principles of that status quo," said
Boyle.
"The Communist, weary of con
fused vaporing about tariff reform,
rugged individualism, prohibition,
and a thousand other issue-cloud
ing trivialities, proposes to dig to the
bottom of the system, discard most
of the outworn social myths upon
which it is founded, and build anew.
Working Class Championed
"As an immediate remedy for the j
depression, he demands direct aid j
for those who suffer most, the work- i
ers. He does not believe in the j
efficacy of loaning to the wealthy, ;
trusting meanwhile that some of the j
money will filter down to the work- j
er. He knows that under the present i
system this is impossible.
"The Communist decries the ter- [
rorist methods of suppression for!
those members of the working class j
who wish to be articulate. As long |
as the Constitution guarantees free
dom of speech and assembly, he feels
he is well within his rights in de
manding enjoyment of those pri- |
viliges.
"The Communist sees in capitalist j
imperialism an inevitable cause of j
wur. He demands an united front i
against these wars and their causes." ;

that some sort of mystical evolution
called progress, assisted by a spirit
of benevolent reform, will even
tually do away with the glaring evils
and inequalities of the capitalist
system. He believes that it is a
gross inconsistency to hold that a
state whose every power is bent on
perpetuating the status quo, will
turn against itself to destroy the
principles of that status quo," said
Boyle.
"The Communist, weary of con
fused vaporing about tariff reform,
rugged individualism, prohibition,
and a thousand other issue-cloud
ing trivialities, proposes to dig to the
bottom of the system, discard most
of the outworn social myths upon
which it is founded, and build anew.

"As an immediate remedy for the j
depression, he demands direct aid j
for those who suffer most, the work- i

efficacy of loaning to the wealthy, ;
trusting meanwhile that some of the j
money will filter down to the work- j

system this is impossible.

Because of the vague notions pre
valent about the Communist Party
in the United States, Wallace Boyle,
'33, an economics major, consented
to outline a few of the issues pre
sented by the Communists in their
campaign to elect William Z. Foster
president.
Boyle stated that he first became
interested in the Communist pro
gram through contacts with foreign
students. Support of the Third In
ternationale is of course much more
common in Europe. The fact that
such American intellectuals as Lin
coln Steffens,, John dos Passos, and
Theodore Dreiser are adherents of
the Communist party shows that its
platform is becoming recognized in
this country. George Foster Pea
body, former banker and eminent
philanthropist, in a communication
to the New York Times, called for a
large protest vote for the Commun
ist candidates because of present
economic conditions.
