# Boyles States Communism Is Economic Aid
## Immediate Aid To Workers Held Imperative 
### Paul Zuich 
Because of the vague notions pre
valent about the Communist Party
in the United States, Wallace Boyle,
'33, an economics major, consented
to outline a few of the issues pre
sented by the Communists in their
campaign to elect William Z. Foster
president.
Boyle stated that he first became
interested in the Communist pro
gram through contacts with foreign
students. Support of the Third In
ternationale is of course much more
common in Europe. The fact that
such American intellectuals as Lin
coln Steffens,, John dos Passos, and
Theodore Dreiser are adherents of
the Communist party shows that its
platform is becoming recognized in
this country. George Foster Pea
body, former banker and eminent
philanthropist, in a communication
to the New York Times, called for a
large protest vote for the Commun
ist candidates because of present
economic conditions.
Party Platform Quoted
In presenting the Communist case
Boyle quoted extensively from party
platform. "The Communist denies
that some sort of mystical evolution
called progress, assisted by a spirit
of benevolent reform, will even
tually do away with the glaring evils
and inequalities of the capitalist
system. He believes that it is a
gross inconsistency to hold that a
state whose every power is bent on
perpetuating the status quo, will
turn against itself to destroy the
principles of that status quo," said
