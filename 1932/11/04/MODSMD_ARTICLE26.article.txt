Huskies In San Francisco
The Washington squad arrived in
San Francisco last night, and will
reach Palo Alto in time to work out
in the Stadium this afternoon. The
Huskies, although beaten by Cali
fornia, tied a favorite Oregon team
and boast their strongest squad
since 1925. And in that year, the
Northerners beat the Cards, al
though they haven't done it since.
A backfield with unpronounceable
names, a veteran line, and a coach
who must produce or go the way of
all flesh and losing grid mentors
combine to make the Huskies no
one's setup. Stanford is favored, but
not by much.
Practice Against Frosh
The ambitious and obliging frosh
ran through Washington formations
yesterday in order to give the Card
varsity a chance to see on Thursday
what they will see on Saturday.
The Indians then ran their own pet
Warner plays against the inoffen

finally sped up ana down the turf
in another dummy signal drill.
Yet even after Pop Warner said,
"That's enough fellows," a group of
men who know they must win spent

passing. The squad will taper off
with a light practice this afternoon.
