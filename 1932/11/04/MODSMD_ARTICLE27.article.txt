The words and music to Mr.
j Walters song may be found on
i page 3of this issue of the Daily.
Stanford has another new song,
i Its name is "The Stanford Axe.
1 Henry F. Walter, a member of
| the Class of '01, who wrote Stanford
songs in the '90s, is the author, and
E. R. Flint, of the Class of '02, has
| arranged for the piano the music
j from a famous French march. Flint
also arranged "Stanford Forever."
I The song will be introduced by
! the band at tomorrow's game. It
will also be on sale at the Book-
J store. Two thousand copies will be
; printed, the first five hundred of
I which will be given away free. A
! charge of five cents per copy will
i be made for the remainder.
This is in line with the band's
j policy of having all worthwhile
I Stanford songs printed and any
; aspiring lyric writers are asked to
' submit their efforts for considera
! tion.
I Inasmuch as it has not yet been
; brought before the Rally Commit
i tee, Mr. Walter's lyric has not yet
j been adopted as an official Stanford
: song.
