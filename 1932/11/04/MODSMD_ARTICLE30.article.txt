"Pop" Warner's line team from conference consideration.
Yet I'.C.L.A. hardly has a more linn friend today than
Stanford in spite of the fac I that the Bruins climbed a notch
higher toward i'ooloall prominence at Stanford's expense.
"What made Saturday's victory so satisfying was the

devoid of an v small-time bitterness often characteristic of I
gridiron struggles.
"I'.C.L.A. has no liner friend than Stanford. Bruin ath
letic history is full of incidents where Stanford's aid has
been a deciding factor in Bruin advancement.
"This friendship between the two institutions has al
ways been reflected in the clean-cut sportsmanship appar
ent at the athletic meetings between the two.

il is another milestone in a strong and steadfast friendship
which will ripen as time goes on."
