# BULL SESSION
## THE 						HAND THAT ROCKS THE PAY ENVELOPE 
### 
There are no "forgotten men" dur
ing a national campaign. The most
significant, uneducated, uninspired
hunk of breathing flesh becomes
important on election day—provided
he has registered. The theory of
democracy is very pleasing to the
person who is nobody for most of j
his life. He is never consulted about
anything except his vote.
Lincoln's lovable legend about
"government of the people, by the j
people, and for the people" stirs the
common man; stirs him because it .
flatters him. It seems to indicate that
contrary to what he knows to be
the facts—he really is somebody. :
The theory of some 50 million peo- j
pie marching to the polls on elec- !
tion day to determine the fate of the |
nation is inspiring to most of the '
50 million.
I
Eut in this campaign, as in most
campaigns, it is seen that the lead
ers of business and finance are not j
content to subsidize the parties and
vote in humble peace. They are en
deavoring to influence voters by i
brandishing the sword of economic !
dependence. The other day some i
mogul in San Francisco came out
boldly and stated (hat if a certain
candidate were elected to the Presi- j
dence he would cancel a tentative !
order for certain goods. The impun- j
ity of the statement is revealing.
The voters are not going to be al
lowed to vote according to Ihe vari
ous extraneous matters that usually
determine voters. They will vote j
with definite threats in mind. The j
days of Mark Hanna are not here. !
Then, employers said. "Vote for 'X' :
or no jobs on the ninth of Novem- j

' ber." This is the day when things
are done with more finesse—less
| honesty—and probably with more
efficiency. Now, the business barons
and industrial incas simply recom
mend to their workers how to vote.
The workers supply the rest.
Politics is very interesting the day
before the election but a job is more
interesting over a longer period of
time. And if people begin to feel it's
a choice between "industrial bread"
and so-called "political baloney,"
(hey will not be long in making up
their mind. There are very few
people that would choose a political
expression in preference to a job.
So, instead of having the glorious
picture of 50 million free Ameri
cans marching fearlessly to the polls
to choose a President, we will soon
have the not so glamorous picture
of several thousand tycoons direct
ing the voting from overstuffed of
fice chairs.
This is only natural. Men who
have power will use it for what they
think is their interest. No real dan
ger usually occurs, however, be
cause there are usually business
men in both parties doing the same
stunt. Money knows no party lines.
The struggle between politics and
business is inevitable. Mussolini
solved it by running both; so did
Communism.
Democracy is a beautiful illusion
—so beautiful that Plato, who knew
beauty in its highest forms, realized
that democracy was a failure. Politi- j
cal individualism is a painful hang- j
ever. The hand that can rock the J
pay envelope rules the land.

fice chairs.
This is only natural. Men who
have power will use it for what they
think is their interest. No real dan
ger usually occurs, however, be
cause there are usually business
men in both parties doing the same
stunt. Money knows no party lines.
The struggle between politics and
business is inevitable. Mussolini
solved it by running both; so did
Communism.
Democracy is a beautiful illusion
—so beautiful that Plato, who knew
beauty in its highest forms, realized
that democracy was a failure. Politi- j
cal individualism is a painful hang- j
ever. The hand that can rock the J
pay envelope rules the land.
—Abe Mellinkoff
There are no "forgotten men" dur
ing a national campaign. The most
significant, uneducated, uninspired
hunk of breathing flesh becomes
important on election day—provided
he has registered. The theory of
democracy is very pleasing to the
person who is nobody for most of j
his life. He is never consulted about
anything except his vote.
Lincoln's lovable legend about
"government of the people, by the j
people, and for the people" stirs the
common man; stirs him because it .
flatters him. It seems to indicate that
contrary to what he knows to be
the facts—he really is somebody. :
The theory of some 50 million peo- j
pie marching to the polls on elec- !
tion day to determine the fate of the |
nation is inspiring to most of the '
50 million.
I
Eut in this campaign, as in most
campaigns, it is seen that the lead
ers of business and finance are not j
content to subsidize the parties and
vote in humble peace. They are en
deavoring to influence voters by i
brandishing the sword of economic !
dependence. The other day some i
mogul in San Francisco came out
boldly and stated (hat if a certain
candidate were elected to the Presi- j
dence he would cancel a tentative !
order for certain goods. The impun- j
ity of the statement is revealing.
The voters are not going to be al
lowed to vote according to Ihe vari
ous extraneous matters that usually
determine voters. They will vote j
with definite threats in mind. The j
days of Mark Hanna are not here. !
Then, employers said. "Vote for 'X' :
or no jobs on the ninth of Novem- j

' ber." This is the day when things
are done with more finesse—less
| honesty—and probably with more
efficiency. Now, the business barons
and industrial incas simply recom
mend to their workers how to vote.
The workers supply the rest.
Politics is very interesting the day
before the election but a job is more
interesting over a longer period of
time. And if people begin to feel it's
a choice between "industrial bread"
and so-called "political baloney,"
(hey will not be long in making up
their mind. There are very few
people that would choose a political
expression in preference to a job.
So, instead of having the glorious
picture of 50 million free Ameri
cans marching fearlessly to the polls
to choose a President, we will soon
have the not so glamorous picture
of several thousand tycoons direct
ing the voting from overstuffed of
fice chairs.
