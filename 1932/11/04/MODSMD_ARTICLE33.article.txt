THE ALL-AMERICAN (Universal)
—At Ihe Stanford Theatre.
Football fans will delight in I+iis
tale of an invincible football hero
and his gridiron prowess, while
critical movie-goers will be disap
pointed in a periodic, loosely con
nected story. And everyone will
watch for the appeai'ances of Pop
Warner and Ernie Nevers which,
be warned, are fleeting.
Eichard Arlen is Garry King,
prince of football players, and the
story deals principally with his diffi
culties after graduation. He gr>es
from bad to worse (the girl believ
ing in him all the while) and finally
ends up on top, after having barely
saved his ..brother from a similar
fate.
The football shots are excellent.
Universal has assembled practically
every famous grid star for the pic
ture, and they might as well have
been Hollywood extras, for all the
football they display. We see Arlen
running single-handed through the
entire Who's Who or football; but
then, I suppose there is something
exhilarating about the feeling that
one is watching Albie Booth or
Chris Cagle.
In view of high odds against him,
Arlen manages to make his role
convincing, despite a tendency to
overact. He seems to improve with
each succeeding picture.
Second honors go to Jimmy Glca
son for his final pantomime as the
coach. And the gravel-throated Andy
Devine adds some good comedy
moments John Darrow, the younger
brother, shows definite promise. The
feminine roles are insignificant and
are colorlessly handled by Gloria
Stuart, June Clyde, and Merna
Kennedy. —Chapin
TIIE PRINCESS MARRIES THE
PAGE. By Edna St. Vincent Mil
lay. Harpers. 1932. $2. (At the
Gordon Strawbridge Library.)
Successful authors have a habit
of dusting off their early writings

to present ihem to what they expect
will be 'a delighted public. It is an
annoying practice as a rule.
But one doesn't need to feel any
condescension toward Edna St. Vin
cent Millay's exhumed efforts, if !
they may judge by "The Princess
Marries the Page." This one-act
play in verse was written while
Miss Millay was an undergraduate
a1 Vassal'. It was presented there and
the manuscript lost, to he found
again thirteen years later. Here it is
for your delight.
Miss Millay offers it somewhat
uncertainly, but she needn't have.
It is youthful, yes, but therein lies |
its light-hearted spontaneity. The j
blank verse is unpretentious, used j
only to heighten the gay, poetic i
charm of the dramatic situations.
Miss Millay's delicate sense of
drama, which expressed itself more
broadly in later plays, is even here
neatly timed. "The Princess Marries
the Page" may be better drama than
poetry, but on that score alone it is
charmingly fanciful.
— Broughton j
The book contains illustrations by
J. Paget-Fredericks, whose exhibit
here this summer was spectacular. '
Unfortunately the drawings seem to
lose life in the reproductions of this
edition—a condition which harms
considerably their imaginative |
quality. —Sandoe

THE ALL-AMERICAN (Universal)
—At Ihe Stanford Theatre.
Football fans will delight in I+iis
tale of an invincible football hero
and his gridiron prowess, while
critical movie-goers will be disap
pointed in a periodic, loosely con
nected story. And everyone will
watch for the appeai'ances of Pop
Warner and Ernie Nevers which,
be warned, are fleeting.
Eichard Arlen is Garry King,
prince of football players, and the
story deals principally with his diffi
culties after graduation. He gr>es
from bad to worse (the girl believ
ing in him all the while) and finally
ends up on top, after having barely
saved his ..brother from a similar
fate.
The football shots are excellent.
Universal has assembled practically
every famous grid star for the pic
ture, and they might as well have
been Hollywood extras, for all the
football they display. We see Arlen
running single-handed through the
entire Who's Who or football; but
then, I suppose there is something
exhilarating about the feeling that
one is watching Albie Booth or
Chris Cagle.
In view of high odds against him,
Arlen manages to make his role
convincing, despite a tendency to
overact. He seems to improve with
each succeeding picture.
Second honors go to Jimmy Glca
son for his final pantomime as the
coach. And the gravel-throated Andy
Devine adds some good comedy
moments John Darrow, the younger
brother, shows definite promise. The
feminine roles are insignificant and
are colorlessly handled by Gloria
Stuart, June Clyde, and Merna
Kennedy. —Chapin
TIIE PRINCESS MARRIES THE
PAGE. By Edna St. Vincent Mil
lay. Harpers. 1932. $2. (At the
Gordon Strawbridge Library.)
Successful authors have a habit
of dusting off their early writings

to present ihem to what they expect
will be 'a delighted public. It is an
annoying practice as a rule.
But one doesn't need to feel any
condescension toward Edna St. Vin
cent Millay's exhumed efforts, if !
they may judge by "The Princess
Marries the Page." This one-act
play in verse was written while
Miss Millay was an undergraduate
a1 Vassal'. It was presented there and
the manuscript lost, to he found
again thirteen years later. Here it is
for your delight.
Miss Millay offers it somewhat
uncertainly, but she needn't have.
It is youthful, yes, but therein lies |
its light-hearted spontaneity. The j
blank verse is unpretentious, used j
only to heighten the gay, poetic i
charm of the dramatic situations.
Miss Millay's delicate sense of
drama, which expressed itself more
broadly in later plays, is even here
neatly timed. "The Princess Marries
the Page" may be better drama than
poetry, but on that score alone it is
charmingly fanciful.
