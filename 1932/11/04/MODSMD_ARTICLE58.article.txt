### Bob Wade 
Thirty-three Stanford freshman
football players leave tomorrow
morning for Berkeley where they
will meet the California Cubs at 2
o'clock in a game thai has years of
tradition behind it, ;ill of it bad.
Recognized as the most uncertain
game of (he year, since the favored
team almost always loses, this year's
contest is slated to produce some of
the best football .shown by yearling
teams of the two institutions in
recent years.
Back field Outstanding
The Card babes will have as their
most publicized weapon of attack
a backfield that combines everything
a football offense needs-—brains,
brawn, speed, and experience.
With flashy Bob Grayson at left
.half, hard-blocking "Boms" Hamil
[ ton as his running mate, stocky
'Frank Alustiza at his regular full
back post, and Earl Hoos calling (he
plays, Stanford presents what has so
far seemed like the best frosh back
field on the coast.
I Stonewall Line
Bui in front of these flashes, fur
nishing the power that makes the
Redshirt offense go, and the stone
wall defense that keeps the scoring
patch clean, are seven of the finest
freshman linemen, for their weight,
that have ever worn the Cardinal
jersey.

In Monk Moscrip and Alex Thom
pas, Coach Chuck Winterburn has
found a pair of ends that has been
unbeatable so far. They are fast,,
deadly tacklers, and great on passes.
Moscrip is the boy who does most
of the converting, in addition to his
other duties. And right behind these
two are Kingsbury end Leedy, who
have been alternating with the
regulars most of the season.
Callaway and Reynolds
Callaway and Reynolds are the
tiny boys who bring joy to the j
hearts ol the varsity coaches as they ;
dream of stopping S.C.'s off-tackle
thrusts in the years to come. In re
serve at any time are Carlson and '
Maentz. The former takes care of
conversions when Moscrip is on the
sidelines.
Holding down (he guard positions l
are Woody Adams and Laurie Rou- i
ble, two guards who are good i
enough right now to make many of
the college varsities on the coast.
Polished Pivot Men
In the middle of the line Winter
burn can call on Roth, Rosenberg,
or Howell in that order, and each 1
of these boys is a polished pivot
man.
If the California line does not
prove too tough, fans will get a look j
a! Johnnie He ncr, Sheldon Bron- '
stein, Ray Lewis, and Oct Morgan,
who make up the second-string I
backfield combination.
Winterburn is taking Adams, '
Alustiza, Bardin, Bronstein, Calla

bury, Leedy, Harris, Maeniz, Mai- i

In Monk Moscrip and Alex Thom
pas, Coach Chuck Winterburn has
found a pair of ends that has been
unbeatable so far. They are fast,,
deadly tacklers, and great on passes.
Moscrip is the boy who does most
of the converting, in addition to his
other duties. And right behind these
two are Kingsbury end Leedy, who
have been alternating with the
regulars most of the season.
Callaway and Reynolds
Callaway and Reynolds are the
tiny boys who bring joy to the j
hearts ol the varsity coaches as they ;
dream of stopping S.C.'s off-tackle
thrusts in the years to come. In re
serve at any time are Carlson and '
Maentz. The former takes care of
conversions when Moscrip is on the
sidelines.
Holding down (he guard positions l
are Woody Adams and Laurie Rou- i
ble, two guards who are good i
enough right now to make many of
the college varsities on the coast.
Polished Pivot Men
In the middle of the line Winter
burn can call on Roth, Rosenberg,
or Howell in that order, and each 1
of these boys is a polished pivot
man.
If the California line does not
prove too tough, fans will get a look j
a! Johnnie He ncr, Sheldon Bron- '
stein, Ray Lewis, and Oct Morgan,
who make up the second-string I
backfield combination.
Winterburn is taking Adams, '
