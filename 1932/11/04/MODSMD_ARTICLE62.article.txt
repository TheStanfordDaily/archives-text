# Mann Frosh From S. F.
## 
### JULIUS JACOBS 
When the Stanford Babes' foot- t
ball team meets the California
freshmen in their annual "Little Big
Game" tomorrow over at Berkeley,
to a bunch of fellows from San j
Francisco who are on the Card |
frosh, the game will have double
| significance.
Just about a year ago in a post }
season game at Kezar Stadium, the
San Francisco All Stars played a
! similar group of high-school grid-
I men from across-the-bay schools,
i Both teams represented the pick of
! their leagues' athletes, most of the I
'men having been chosen as all-city j
material.
In a one-sided contest these San '
Francisco high-school boys romped
j away with an easy victory.

After the game, they met in the
dressing-room and talked over their !
win. Most of them were seniors, !
with their last prep game behind 1
them. As a unit Ihey had played i
for just a few weeks, but still there !
were warm friendships formed.
The result of their discussion was |
that they decided to continue their j
education and football under Pop i
Warner at Stanford. That they made
good will be evidenced by the num- 1
ber of San Francisco boys in the i
starting lineup for Saturday's game.
From Lowell, Larry Rouble and
Harry Carlson guinea admittance to
Stanford, Commerce sent three all- 1
city men, Bob Roth, Earl lloos, and
Jimmy Reisner. Balboa, a new high
school in the city, had another all- j

city man in Woody Adams, a guard,
who also came to Encina last Octo
ber. S : d Rosenberg and Bob Mc-
Roth came in from Galileo.
City Boys Start (lame
Now with all (he competition for
berths on the squad this fall, with
outstanding material for every posi
tion, an unusually high number of
these have gained places in the
starting lineup tomorrow. Rouble
and Adams will start at guard, Roth
at center for Stanford. Carlson will
probably play half the game at
tackle, sharing work with Reynolds,
and if Grayson's face injury bothers
him, Reisner, a bang-up player who
has almost equaled Grayson's play
at halfback this year, will go into
the game.
