the Olympic Club.
The Card team defeated Califor- |
nia last week in a very close series !
of matches, captured finally in a !
match which singularly enough saw
Chain of the campus victorious over
Locke of California.
This victory assured Stanford of â– 
a leg on the trophy vied for by the |
three organizations. Victory over the
clubmen tomorrow will again give |
the trophy, a much coveted one, I
(o Stanford for the second succes- j
sive year. They won it for the first j
time last year. The three previous '
times it was taken by the Olympic'
Club.
A tie, however, tomorrow night, j
will place the three teams in a I
triangular lie for first place, which
would then result in the trophy
being awarded on a percentage of j
bouts system.
Coach Bugge plans to use his :
regular veteran team, composed of j
Pearman, Pockman, Ferguson, and!
Snyder. The fifth and sixth posi- '
tions will he held by Chain and
Munger, the two promising new- 1
comers.
