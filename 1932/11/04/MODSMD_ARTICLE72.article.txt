# CALIFORNIA BEARS THREATEN TO END U.S.C. WIN STREAK
## Ingram Eleven Claims Even Chance Against Troy Despite Odds 
### 
Banking on an equal share of the
breaks, the services of Hjtrd Luck
Hank Schaldach once again at his
best, and a spirit of fight ever pres
ent in Bill Ingram's grid elevens,
the California Golden Bears invade
the Olympic Stadium in Los Angelt s
tomorrow determined to end the
fifteen game winning streak of the
U.S.C. Trojans.
Although the Trojans, whose goal
line has yet to be crossed this year,
reign 10 to (i I'avoriteS, the Bears
maintain that they have an almost
even chance for victory based on
the improvement they have shown
in their last two encounters.
Kaiisome, Tozer Tackles
Another good reason the Bears
think they will upset the dope
bucket is that in their opinion Ran
sotne and Tozer are even matches
to Brown and Smith as defensive
tackles. Thus, conclude the Bears,
the Trojan powerhouse will get no
farther than California's off-tackle
play itself. And with the brainiest
field general on the coast in Gus
Castro and the triple threat quali
ties of Hank Schaldach in the Bear
baekficld, maybe this California
simple but powerful offense will go
places.
Strong trokles are not the only
. assets necessary to stop the Tro
jans, however. In fact strong ends
are probably the best solution to
the Trojan offense. When opposed
, by weak wingmen, the Trojans can
use an extra man to keep the tackle
out of the play entirely while less
effort is being expended to push
I the end to one side. To prevent this
! the Bears are depending on Jones
and Carol Gill. So far they have
made good reputations but have not
been up against anything like Tro
jan competition.
Bears In Good Condition
With Hank Schaldach in the line
up for the first time in his career
against the Trojans and with the
i rest of the team in almost perfect
i physical condition, the Boars will
i present the most formidable array
of man power yet to be assembled
|by Bill Ingram. And in the opinion
1 of Ingram himself it will be sufficient
;, to overcome U.S.C. if the breaks are
even and if California plays the ag
gressive offensive brand of footbnll
it has been taught to play.
I Intensive preparation for Satur-
I day's contest was completed by the
j Bears Wednesday. They will leave
1 tomorrow night for the south.

Banking on an equal share of the
breaks, the services of Hjtrd Luck
Hank Schaldach once again at his
best, and a spirit of fight ever pres
ent in Bill Ingram's grid elevens,
the California Golden Bears invade
the Olympic Stadium in Los Angelt s
tomorrow determined to end the
fifteen game winning streak of the
U.S.C. Trojans.
Although the Trojans, whose goal
line has yet to be crossed this year,
reign 10 to (i I'avoriteS, the Bears
maintain that they have an almost
even chance for victory based on
the improvement they have shown
in their last two encounters.
Kaiisome, Tozer Tackles
Another good reason the Bears
think they will upset the dope
bucket is that in their opinion Ran
sotne and Tozer are even matches
to Brown and Smith as defensive
tackles. Thus, conclude the Bears,
the Trojan powerhouse will get no
farther than California's off-tackle
play itself. And with the brainiest
field general on the coast in Gus
Castro and the triple threat quali
ties of Hank Schaldach in the Bear
baekficld, maybe this California
simple but powerful offense will go
places.
Strong trokles are not the only
. assets necessary to stop the Tro
jans, however. In fact strong ends
are probably the best solution to
the Trojan offense. When opposed
, by weak wingmen, the Trojans can
use an extra man to keep the tackle
out of the play entirely while less
effort is being expended to push
I the end to one side. To prevent this
! the Bears are depending on Jones
and Carol Gill. So far they have
made good reputations but have not
been up against anything like Tro
jan competition.
Bears In Good Condition
With Hank Schaldach in the line
up for the first time in his career
against the Trojans and with the
i rest of the team in almost perfect
i physical condition, the Boars will
i present the most formidable array
of man power yet to be assembled
|by Bill Ingram. And in the opinion
1 of Ingram himself it will be sufficient
;, to overcome U.S.C. if the breaks are
even and if California plays the ag
gressive offensive brand of footbnll
it has been taught to play.
I Intensive preparation for Satur-
I day's contest was completed by the
j Bears Wednesday. They will leave
