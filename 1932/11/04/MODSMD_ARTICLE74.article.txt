REPORTS FROM THE
SOUTH claim that our fresh
men football team is composed
of a bunch of lough youn« men
with mayhem as their chief in
terest in life.
It seems that the Trobabe outfit
/as not only beaten but badly bat
iied last Saturday. Cullenward,
;ft half, is still in the hospital with
.slight concussion of the brain. Jim
iaunders, small brother of the
imous "Racehorse Russell," is nurs
lg a broken collar bone. And some
nnamed gentleman is favoring a
roken ankle. As nearly as we can
ecall, that last v/as the work of
Bones" Hamilton. He blocked the
.outhern California victim out of
play and the youngster came up
/ith a snapped ankle. Maybe there
S something in a name!!!
IT LOOKS TO US AS II the
Old Fox has come through with
another of his iancy tricks, and
if it doesn't work, it won't be his
fault.
After the boys came back from the
J.C.LA. beating it was a cinch that
ley would fight themselves out dur
ig the week trying to get to the
oint where they would tear Washi
ngton apart.
But Pop fooled them all by laying
hem off until he felt like bringing
he gang back. Monday all went
/ell. Tuesday night they began to
et restive. Doub was out in his
rack pants catching passes, Lambert
nd Kite held the line for the
iray - Substitute battle. Hillman
mbled around looking for some
hing to do. Laborde and Maentz
ashed up and down the length of
he field, just 1o show the Old Man
hat they could and would be in the
ext game, even though Maentz
asn't much chance to rate in Sat
rday's clash.
Wednesday night a committee
ame around to find out if they
/ere being disciplined, and the en
uing workout was the best seen
round here for some time.
If the boys show as much pep
gainst the Huskies, there won't be
nyfhing but teeth and bones left
iter the afternoon's battle.
ORDINARILY WE DON'T
(JO in for personal comment, but
we would like to remind Mr.
Jack McDonald of the San
Francisco Examiner that WE
have the AXE not California,
even if the darn thing 1 IS in the
American Tru st Company's
vault.
THE APPOINTMENT OF
BILL DOUB to captain the var
sity against Washington is a
move that no one will regret.
Doub lias been getting better
and better as the season ad
vanced, and now he rates as
justl about the best wingrnan
on the team.
Bill ought to be eheerecl by the
iews that Ted "Blimp" Isaacson has
•een on a diet, and they've trained
iim down to a mere shadow of his
inner self. He breaks the scales
t a paltry 258 pounds, ten under
is last year's playing weight.
Get him, men, he ought to be a
lushover!!

IT LOOKS TO US AS II the
Old Fox has come through with

if it doesn't work, it won't be his

After the boys came back from the
J.C.LA. beating it was a cinch that

But Pop fooled them all by laying
hem off until he felt like bringing
he gang back. Monday all went

et restive. Doub was out in his
rack pants catching passes, Lambert

mbled around looking for some
hing to do. Laborde and Maentz
ashed up and down the length of

THE APPOINTMENT OF
BILL DOUB to captain the var

move that no one will regret.
Doub lias been getting better
and better as the season ad
vanced, and now he rates as

on the team.
Bill ought to be eheerecl by the
iews that Ted "Blimp" Isaacson has

iim down to a mere shadow of his
