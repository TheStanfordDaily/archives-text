# Card Soccer Squad Opens U. C. Series Today
## STANFORD ELEVEN HEAVILY FAVORED TO DEFEAT BEARS Coach Harry Maloney May Start Senior Members Of Indian Team 
### Maurice Rapf 
It is an old saying at Stanford
that a win over California makes
any Indian team's season a success.
Possessed with this idea, Coach
Harry Maloney's twice-beaten soc
cer .squad plans to take the disaster
out of what might have been a most
disastrous campaign by opening the
annual three-game series against the
Bears with a win in this afternoon's
affair. The game starts at 4 o'clock
on Stanford's field.
The California kickers have been
unimpressive in their contests this
year, and there is no reason why
th" Indians can't repeat their per
formance of last year when they
won all three games. Nevertheless,
Coach Maloney's men were also dis
tinctly superior in the game against
San Mateo this week but could not
convert their strength into scores.
The defense of the San Mateo
team, however, rates far superior to
that of the Bears and it may be that
Stanford will show a real display
of kicking ability against its tradi
tional rivals. Even the weak San
Jose team, held to a single goal in
each of its games with the Indians,
was able to score three goals against
the Bears, but lost the game, 4-3. j
It can easily be seen that the Berk
eley booters are a fighting team,
capable of scoring when goals have
to be made.
Indians Are "Due"
If the Indians have any good
games at ail in their system they
will play it today. They always do
against the Bears.
There is a strong possiblity that
Coach Maloney may start some of
the senior members of his squad to
give them a chance to make their
letters. McShea and Brash, full
backs, and Ingcbretsen, goalie, are
among the non-regulars who may
get a chance to play.
In view of Carl Knecht's fine per
formance in the San Mateo game,
Maloney will switch this excellent
outside left to an inside left posi
tion where he may be the spark of
the forward line. Cy Johnson there
by moves over to inside right, at
which position he is better suited
to play, and Wataro Sutow takes
Knecht's place. Art Hearn remains
at center forward and Laurie Wash
burn at outside right.
Reserves Named
The men that back up this quin
tet is made up of Dodington, out
side right, Viguie, a senior, inside
right, Emerick, center forward, and
Rojas, inside left.
Doug Kennedy starts at center
half, wifh Alex Spohr at right half
and Waddy White at left half. Ni
coll will back up Kennedy, and
Dunning, Strouse, and Hitchcock
will be kept in reserve for the other
halfback spots.
Nif Branch will probably start
with Captain Erwin Brekelbaum at
iullback, but Bill Krumbein, another
senior, will relieve Branch later in
the game. Bernie Leven or Kelly
Steele may see action.
Jack King is the goalie who opens
the game, with Milt Newman in
reserve.

among the non-regulars who may
get a chance to play.
In view of Carl Knecht's fine per
formance in the San Mateo game,
Maloney will switch this excellent
outside left to an inside left posi
tion where he may be the spark of
the forward line. Cy Johnson there
by moves over to inside right, at
which position he is better suited
to play, and Wataro Sutow takes
Knecht's place. Art Hearn remains
at center forward and Laurie Wash
burn at outside right.
Reserves Named
The men that back up this quin
tet is made up of Dodington, out
side right, Viguie, a senior, inside
right, Emerick, center forward, and
Rojas, inside left.
Doug Kennedy starts at center
half, wifh Alex Spohr at right half
and Waddy White at left half. Ni
coll will back up Kennedy, and
Dunning, Strouse, and Hitchcock
will be kept in reserve for the other
halfback spots.
Nif Branch will probably start
with Captain Erwin Brekelbaum at
iullback, but Bill Krumbein, another
senior, will relieve Branch later in
the game. Bernie Leven or Kelly
Steele may see action.
Jack King is the goalie who opens
the game, with Milt Newman in
reserve.
It is an old saying at Stanford
that a win over California makes
any Indian team's season a success.
Possessed with this idea, Coach
Harry Maloney's twice-beaten soc
cer .squad plans to take the disaster
out of what might have been a most
disastrous campaign by opening the
annual three-game series against the
Bears with a win in this afternoon's
affair. The game starts at 4 o'clock
on Stanford's field.
The California kickers have been
unimpressive in their contests this
year, and there is no reason why
th" Indians can't repeat their per
formance of last year when they
won all three games. Nevertheless,
Coach Maloney's men were also dis
tinctly superior in the game against
San Mateo this week but could not
convert their strength into scores.
The defense of the San Mateo
team, however, rates far superior to
that of the Bears and it may be that
Stanford will show a real display
of kicking ability against its tradi
tional rivals. Even the weak San
Jose team, held to a single goal in
each of its games with the Indians,
was able to score three goals against
the Bears, but lost the game, 4-3. j
It can easily be seen that the Berk
eley booters are a fighting team,
capable of scoring when goals have
to be made.
Indians Are "Due"
If the Indians have any good
games at ail in their system they
will play it today. They always do
against the Bears.
There is a strong possiblity that
Coach Maloney may start some of
the senior members of his squad to
give them a chance to make their
letters. McShea and Brash, full
backs, and Ingcbretsen, goalie, are
among the non-regulars who may
get a chance to play.
