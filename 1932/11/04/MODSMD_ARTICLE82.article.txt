# SATURDAY GRID THRILLERS PROMISE TITLE DECISIONS
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
There is no football tomorrow
afternoon equal to last Saturday s
Notre Dame-Pittsburg thriller, but
there are many traditional "Big
Games" scheduled, and on several
of these will hinge state, conference,
and even sectional championships.
Bears Tough????
Although justly favored, U.S.C.
may find the Golden Bears a much
tougher foe than has been freely
predicted. Troy's greatest superior
ity is in tackle and end material.
Injuries have prevented California
from developing a strong secondary
defense unit, although man-for-man
the Bears have better backfield men
than U.S.C.
Stanford and Washington appear
to be very evenly matched. The
Indians probably have a stronger
eleven, but the Huskies have had
a better chance to rest up since
their last important game. Oregon
and Oregon State meet in their an
nual grudge battle. Eugene's squad
has shown greater strength than the
Corvallis Staters, but comparative
records mean little or nothing in this
classic of Northwest football. The
eyes of the nation will be focused
on another Pacific Coast team, little
St. Mary's. The Moragans have
traveled three thousand miles to
play Fordham in New York.
Eastern Games
Undefeated teams will help to
clarify the Eastern situation by play
ing among themselves in three im-

portant games. Pittsburg, last week's
giant-killer, plays undefeated Penn
sylvania, and is heavily favored to
win. Brown and Holy Cross tangle
at Providence, with Brown enjoying
the pre-game edge. Columbia and
Cornell play in New York as rival
attractions to St. Mary's-Fordham.
Columbia is a 10-8 favorite.
The year's biggest surprise team,
undefeated and untied Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, will face its
biggest barrier tomorrow in Ala
bama's Crimson Wave. If Virginia
Poly wins, she will probably romp
off with the Southern Conference
title, since Tennessee may very well
be upset by Vanderbilt on November
12.
Rice Favored
The Southwest Conference games
do not have a large bearing on the
championship: Rice should trample
Arkansas, Southern Methodist faces
Texas A and M to determine the
weakest team in the conference,
Texas will have no trouble with
Baylor, while Texas Christian again
steps outside conference competition
to play Simmons University.
In the Big Ten, Michigan and
Purdue, the onl> two remaining un
defeated teams, will resume warfare
with conference oponents. The
Wolverines take on Indiana at
Bloemington, and the Boilermakers
play Stagg's Maroons at Chicago.
The revived Illinois eleven battles
Wisconsin at Madison. Ohio State
plays Northwestern.

may find the Golden Bears a much
tougher foe than has been freely
predicted. Troy's greatest superior
ity is in tackle and end material.
Injuries have prevented California
from developing a strong secondary
defense unit, although man-for-man
the Bears have better backfield men
than U.S.C.
Stanford and Washington appear
to be very evenly matched. The
Indians probably have a stronger
eleven, but the Huskies have had
a better chance to rest up since
their last important game. Oregon
and Oregon State meet in their an
nual grudge battle. Eugene's squad
has shown greater strength than the
Corvallis Staters, but comparative
records mean little or nothing in this
classic of Northwest football. The
eyes of the nation will be focused
on another Pacific Coast team, little
St. Mary's. The Moragans have
traveled three thousand miles to
play Fordham in New York.
Eastern Games
Undefeated teams will help to
clarify the Eastern situation by play
ing among themselves in three im-

portant games. Pittsburg, last week's
giant-killer, plays undefeated Penn
sylvania, and is heavily favored to
win. Brown and Holy Cross tangle
at Providence, with Brown enjoying
the pre-game edge. Columbia and
Cornell play in New York as rival
attractions to St. Mary's-Fordham.
Columbia is a 10-8 favorite.
The year's biggest surprise team,
undefeated and untied Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, will face its
biggest barrier tomorrow in Ala
bama's Crimson Wave. If Virginia
Poly wins, she will probably romp
off with the Southern Conference
title, since Tennessee may very well
be upset by Vanderbilt on November
12.
Rice Favored
The Southwest Conference games
do not have a large bearing on the
championship: Rice should trample
Arkansas, Southern Methodist faces
Texas A and M to determine the
weakest team in the conference,
Texas will have no trouble with
Baylor, while Texas Christian again
steps outside conference competition
to play Simmons University.
In the Big Ten, Michigan and
Purdue, the onl> two remaining un
defeated teams, will resume warfare
with conference oponents. The
Wolverines take on Indiana at
Bloemington, and the Boilermakers
play Stagg's Maroons at Chicago.
The revived Illinois eleven battles
Wisconsin at Madison. Ohio State
plays Northwestern.
There is no football tomorrow
afternoon equal to last Saturday s
Notre Dame-Pittsburg thriller, but
there are many traditional "Big
Games" scheduled, and on several
of these will hinge state, conference,
and even sectional championships.
