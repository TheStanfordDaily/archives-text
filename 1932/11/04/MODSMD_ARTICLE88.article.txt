# Polo Contest Is Postponed
## 
### 
A last-minute cancellation of the ,
Stanford-San Mateo polo game
slated for this afternoon was an
nounced yesterday. San Mateo has
acccpted an invitation for a match
with the Uplifters of Los Angeles on
Sunday, and has asked that the
Stanford game be postponed so that
their ponies may be rested for the
game.
As a substitute for the San Mateo
game, Captain Dick Gordan, coach
of the Redshirts, has arranged for
a Red-White match between mem
bers of these two divisions of the
varsity squad. A similar match was
tried last spring, and turned out to
be a faster game than 30me of the
intercollegiate tilts.
Lining up for the Reds will be
the regular "first four" who were
to have gone against San Mateo.
Naturally, they'll have somewhat the
edge over the Whites, but there
is a good chance for an upset in
spite of the Reds' superiority. Lup- |
pen and Maer, playing at numbers j
one and four, respectively, should
star for the Whites. Both these men
are only a shade less brilliant than
Melone and Myers, who play on the
Reds at these positions.
Play starts at 3 o'clock on the j
highway field. No admission charge j
will he made.
The line-ups:
Reds Pos. Whites |
Melone 1 Luppen
Spalding 2 Gillingham
Gillham 3 Robb j
J. Myers 4 Maer {
