Handicapped by the loss of their
star player, the only man on the
team who knew the signals, and
suffering injuries incurred in the
dissecting rooms as »vell as in prac
tice scrimmages, the battling Fresh
man Cadaverines suffered a de
cisive 14-0 defeat at the hands of
the experienced sophomore Bacter
iologists yesterday afternoon in the
annual Medical School touch foot
ball classic.
Scoring two touchdowns and an
unexpected safety the dignified sec
ond-year men taught the novices of
Hippocrates their first lesson in pro- I
fessional ethics—respect to their j
superiors.
Before the play began, anatomy j
technician, and the day's grid ref- |
eree, Bert Stroup, cautiously re
moved all hidden scalpels and strep
tococcus cultures from the gowns
of the unscrupulous medics. At
time-outs the cry of "Is there a
doctor in the crowd?" brought on
tc the field the reserves, while the
worn-out gridders retired to the
sidelines to treat themselves for sus
tained injuries. Present were the
women members of the two classes
who ably served as nurses.
Starring for the upperclassmen j
were Cronenwitt, Schunke, Webster,
and wee Willie Okker, red-haired
drum-major of the Stanford Band.
Illegal though effective interference
and clipping served to pave the way
for the soph ball carriers, while the j
freshman fullbacks seemed unable j
to break through their own inter- ;
ference for gains.
Much time was consumed by the j
youngsters who had to figure out i
each play before running them ;
from memorandums left by their
teammate and coach, "Pop" Blanch
ard. The latter was away scouting
the Stanford varsity.
