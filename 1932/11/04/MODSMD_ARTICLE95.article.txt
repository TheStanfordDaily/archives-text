# "LION-MAN" BOTHERED Frosh Joshing Irks Caddel CRABBE IS GIVEN ROLE
## 
### 
Ernie Caddel, varsity halfback, .
was flattered when the Paramount \
Pictures asked him to tai»e screen
tests for the main role of the "lion \
man" in the prospective picture,
"King of the Jungle."
When they mentioned $200 a week
for a period of five weeks, the blond
Apollo was flabbergasted—pleasant- !
ly . ' I
Now, he must feel decidedly cha- |
grined at the announcement that
the role has been assigned to Bus
ter Crabbe, star swimmer.
However, when the Encina fresh- j
men, for whom Caddel is sponsor, j
took to joshing him and calling him ,
"lion man," it culminated in an up- j
roar in the Encina Commons' dining j
hall. His attractive curly hair
moved downward over his forehead j
in a scowl as a noise went through j
the hall. Then, when the personfi- I
cation of the spirit of '36 yelled
from the end of the hall, "Roar for
us, lion man," the varsity halfback
swung from tree to tree down to
ward his challenger at the other end
of the hall, and with one sweep of
his powerful arm stunned his pow- j
erless victim with a sentence of
hours to be worked off at the Con- [
valescent Home.
