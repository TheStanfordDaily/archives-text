### Ronald Chinn 
Coming to the Stanford campus to j
debate the presidential race, Clinton j
Jones and James Jacobs of the Uni- !
versity of Southern California will [
pair of! with Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr., 1
and Joseph Wolf of the Indian de- j
bate squad in a mixed intercollegi- j
ate oratorical contest, at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Little Theatre. Wolf
and Jacobs will oppose the Republi
cans, and Wilbur and Jones will de
fend them.
After the regular speeches the j
meeting will be conducted as an
open forum, in which members of j
the audience may fire questions at .
the debaters.
Thomas S. Barclay, professor of ;
American Government and Politics j
at Stanford, will, as presiding of- j
ficer, see that partisan feeling and j
inter-school rivalry are restricted to j
a battle of words only. Professor |
Barclay is a member of the Demo- j
cratic State Central Committee of j
California, with a reputation of his j
own as an entertaining and effec- |
tive speaker.
Wolf Satirical
Wolf, who will oppose the Hoover j
administration, expects to make hu- |
mor and satire the outstanding char- j
acteristics of his talk. He will not
only oppose Hoover—he will criticize j
practically everything.
Ray Wilbur, on the other hand, j
defending the Republicans, takes his j
role quite seriously. He has never J
before debated, and is now in his i
senior year here.
Jones will speak first for the af
firmative. He will discuss "Hoover's j
measures for economic relief" such j
as the R.F.C. Home Loan Banks, x - e- j
lief agenvies, and industrial and ;
labor conferences.
Wilbur To Praise G.O.P.
Then Wolf, as first speaker for the ]
negative will discuss the seriousness I
of the situation today, and blame it !
on the Republicans, besides criticiz- [
ing their handling of it.
Wilbur will answer Wolf, and
praise the Republican stand on such j
subjects as tariff, farm relief, bonus, !
prohibition, and railroad and power !
problems.
Then the second Trojan speaker, I
James Jacobs, will in turn answer ,
the affirmative arguments and pre- |
sent Roosevelt's proposed policies. I
Each speaker v/ill have ten min- I
utes for his constructive speech, and
five minutes for his rebuttal. Since !
the speeches will last only an hour, !
there will be considerable oppor- j
tunity for the audience to make j
matters unpleasant for the debaters j 1
during the following open forum.
The only decision will bo that of i
the audience—at the polls tomor- \ ■
row. j ■

Wolf Satirical
Wolf, who will oppose the Hoover j
administration, expects to make hu- |
mor and satire the outstanding char- j
acteristics of his talk. He will not
only oppose Hoover—he will criticize j
practically everything.
Ray Wilbur, on the other hand, j
defending the Republicans, takes his j
role quite seriously. He has never J
before debated, and is now in his i
senior year here.
Jones will speak first for the af
firmative. He will discuss "Hoover's j
measures for economic relief" such j
as the R.F.C. Home Loan Banks, x - e- j
lief agenvies, and industrial and ;
labor conferences.
Wilbur To Praise G.O.P.
Then Wolf, as first speaker for the ]
negative will discuss the seriousness I
of the situation today, and blame it !
on the Republicans, besides criticiz- [
ing their handling of it.
Wilbur will answer Wolf, and
praise the Republican stand on such j
subjects as tariff, farm relief, bonus, !
prohibition, and railroad and power !
