# Wright Suffers Broken Leg In Mural Contest
## 
### 
The first serious injury of the in-
tramural football schedule was suf-
fered by Fred Wright, who received
a broken leg in last Friday's game
between Kappa Alpha and Phi
Delta Phi. Wright, a member of
Kappa Alpha fraternity, played on
the Class of '34 frosh basketball team
and was out for this year's squad.
While trying to avoid two oppos-
ing players Wright twisted his leg
badly and fell, causing the fracture.
