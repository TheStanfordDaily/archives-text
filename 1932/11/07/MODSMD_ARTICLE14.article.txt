# Stanford Senior Tells Of Foreign Universities
## 
### JOSEPHINE HAYES 
American and European universi- !
lies differ in many essentials, ac
! cording to Elizabeth Jackson, senior,
who attended the University of
! Geneva and the Graduate Institute
of International Studies in Geneva,
Switzerland, last year.
, "One outstanding divergence j
'abroad is that there are no frequent i
tests, examinations being given at j
! the end of the year or every two
; years," she said yesterday.
Registered at Stanford under the j
Independent Study Plan, Miss Jack
son carried on her work in Geneva |
j from the middle of last January j
1 until the end of August.
Studies in Geneva
Most of her study was done at the
i Graduate Institute of International
Studies, which is a Geneva school
catering to foreign graduate stu
dents. Dr. William Fappard of the
League of Nations is head of the
school, in which visiting experts in ,
various fields give courses. Much
i work is done in the League of Na- ,
11ions library.
Miss Jackson also attended the
University of Geneva, which she
> found very different from Stanford. ]

! European universities have no de-|
j partments, she said, their place
| being taken by various faculties,
broader than the American depart
[ ments. There is no Lower Division,
; but. on entering, a student chooses
his faculty, which has certain gradu
| ation requirements.
No Fraternities
i European universities have nei
j ther fraternities nor sororities, but
there arc various social clubs among
the men, with a students' union also j
jin existence. The University of i
I Geneva has neither an actual cam- i
| pus nor living rules.
Other ways in which European \
| universities differ from American,
, Miss Jackson said, are that every-
\ one rides bicycles; there are no or
i ganized athletics or gym depart- I
ments; there is a wider gulf be
j tween professors and students; and ,
the student class is given special j
| privileges, such as price reductions ;
j in theatres and on trains.
"Attending a European university
is very inexpensive," declared Miss j
I Jackson. "Including transportation
to and from Europe and living for
the year, it costs no more than I
j three quarters at Stanford."
