# FANCY LIGHTING AT TOYON HOP
## Joe Gordon Planning On New Color Effects 
### 
Something in lighting effects so
new that he dares not divulge its
nature until the eventful evening
arrives, has been planned by Joe
Gordon for the annual Toyon Club
informal, to be held this year at 9
o'clock Friday evening, November
11.
Gordon, who is in complete charge
of all the lighting for the dance,
claims to have conceived a master
piece that will please as well as sur
prise the crowd. It is still possible
to become part of that crowd, as
some bids remain unsold and may
be procured for two dollars per
couple at the A.S.S.U. office or in
room 213, Toyon Hall.
The slow, dreamy music so be
loved of Stanford's nimble-toed has
been guaranteed by Gordon Heche,
who will furnish the harmony with
the aid of eight of his famous cam
pus music-masters. Heche's music
has been the chief attraction at
many of the campus dances held to
date.
Gene Mires, chairman of the dance
committee, has promised that there
will be no disturbance from the early
arrival of the roughs.
