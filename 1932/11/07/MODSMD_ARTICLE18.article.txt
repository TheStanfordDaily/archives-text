# U.C. Soccer Squad Fails To Appear For Card Tilt
## 
### 
The California soccer men did not ;
fhow up for their scheduled game
with the Stanford squad last Friday,
and perhaps it's a good thing for
them that they did not.
With twenty-three eager men in i
uniform and no opponent to face :
them, Coach Maloney obliged the
handful of spectators by sending his j
first-string team against the sec- i
onds in a regular game. So impres- j
sive was the first-string team in this
encounter that everyone present en
tertained the same thought, "What
this squad would have done to Cal!"
So, inadvertenatly though it may
have been, the California varsity
took a run-out and missed playing
the Indians when these Indians were
really "hot."
