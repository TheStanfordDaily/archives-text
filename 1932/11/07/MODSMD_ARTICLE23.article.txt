# ALERT PLAYING GIVES HUSKIES 18-13 TRIUMPH
## Washington Team Snaps Up Opportunities Made By Listless Cards INDIANS SCORE FIRST Baker, Colvin, And Corbus Chalk Up Points 
### Dick Strouse 
Out of kind consideration for
Jimmie Phelan's pocketbook, Stan
ford University's well-beaten In
dians obligingly and graciously lost
a game ot football to a mediocre but
alert group of University of Wash
ington Huskies, 13 to 18, Saturday
afternoon, and thus made it pos
sible for Phelan to cancel his ru
mored reservations for a comfort
able Pullman ride back East. Phe
lan, who has not produced teams as
his material apparently warranted
and his alumni vociferously insisted,
seemed headed for the coaches'
showers, until Stanford's better team
lost to a team that played better
football.
In fact, the play of the Stanford
eleven throughout the afternoon
was marked by generous conduct
becoming a Stanford gentleman.
They stood around and timed
Johnny Cherberg on an 88-yard
touchdown sprint, they completed
an unprecedented number of Stan
ford to Washington passes, and they
even allowed a center to score
against them.
An Unorthodox Center
When Colin Howard, Washington
center who has been brought up
incorrectly and does not know his
proper place among the blocking and
tackling slaves of the forward line,
decided, contrary to the best pre
cepts and highest ideals of football
as established by the great teams of
the past and the present, that he
wished to run 58 yards for a touch
down, Stanford didn't stop him.
And when Cherberg caught one
of Stan Anderson's best punts on
his own 12-yard line and started
out on a touchdown jaunt, Stanford
didn't stop him either. Finally,
Stanford didn't stop Paul Sulkosky
when he became infuriated with the
publicity being earned by Howard
and Cherberg and started for the
goal-line, 23 yards away, oil light
tackle.
Cards Forget Selves
The Indians did forget themselves
and become ungentlemanly enough
to score on two occasions, and since
the first one came before Washing
ton had tallied, it appeared for a
while that Warner's men were
thinking of Pop instead of Phelan.
Hard-working Phil Baker, who car
ried the ball 24 times during the
afternoon and averaged 2.0 yards
and who shone among the Card
backs, went over from the 9-inch
line after a 47-yard march.
A perfect Baker to Doub to Cad
del forward-lateral had gained 15
of the 47, Caddel bumping himself
out-of-bounds on the 20-yard line
against Cherberg, and doing it so
well that the Washington safety
man had to take time out. And that
was the only first half thrill except
a 28-yard run by Bill Sim made
possible by a perfect open-field
block by Ted Kite.
Late Rally Fails
Then the first-half gridiron classic
of soaring 35-yard punts and spec
tacular 3-yard runs became a foot
ball game worth watching as Wash
ington scored her unexpected three
touchdowns. And then the game
turned into a real thriller as Stan
ford stopped being gentlemanly and
started to play football.
There were but five minutes left
to play and Phelan had shown (hat
he appreciated the Indians' lr In ess
by sending in all of his remaining
substitutes at once. Passing on every
play, Stanford finally connected with
that old Allen-to-Colvin combina
tion and Don scored on the play,
Bill Cor bus, who as usual played
football all day. kicked the goal and
the count was 18 to 13. But there
wasn't time to .core again, although
Stanford's real superiority was ap
parent in that final rally.
Not Bates' Fault
It wasn't Bates' fault that Stanford
lost. When the gigantic crowd of
7,000 came mournfully out of the
Stadium offering their Big Game
tickets to anyone who would buy, it
was .Bates (particularly for his
blocking the first Washington at
tempt at conversion) along with
Cherberg and Nesbit and Howard
who was being lauded. And Bruce
Tarver, star of the Class of '34's
freshman team, looked like the
player he has always been in his
first varsity appearance.
Acting-Captain Bill Doub was a
real captain and a real football
player Saturday. And Stanford did
move the big blimp, Isaacson,
around. But Stanford's passes were
aimed at the ground or Washington
backs or centers. The score wasn't
larger because, as one rooter said,
''Washington can't catch them if
they're on the ground."

aimed at the ground or Washington
backs or centers. The score wasn't
larger because, as one rooter said,
''Washington can't catch them if
they're on the ground."
Out of kind consideration for
Jimmie Phelan's pocketbook, Stan
ford University's well-beaten In
dians obligingly and graciously lost
a game ot football to a mediocre but
alert group of University of Wash
ington Huskies, 13 to 18, Saturday
afternoon, and thus made it pos
sible for Phelan to cancel his ru
mored reservations for a comfort
able Pullman ride back East. Phe
lan, who has not produced teams as
his material apparently warranted
and his alumni vociferously insisted,
seemed headed for the coaches'
showers, until Stanford's better team
lost to a team that played better
football.
In fact, the play of the Stanford
eleven throughout the afternoon
was marked by generous conduct
becoming a Stanford gentleman.
They stood around and timed
Johnny Cherberg on an 88-yard
touchdown sprint, they completed
an unprecedented number of Stan
ford to Washington passes, and they
even allowed a center to score
against them.
An Unorthodox Center
When Colin Howard, Washington
center who has been brought up
incorrectly and does not know his
proper place among the blocking and
tackling slaves of the forward line,
decided, contrary to the best pre
cepts and highest ideals of football
as established by the great teams of
the past and the present, that he
wished to run 58 yards for a touch
down, Stanford didn't stop him.
And when Cherberg caught one
of Stan Anderson's best punts on
his own 12-yard line and started
out on a touchdown jaunt, Stanford
didn't stop him either. Finally,
Stanford didn't stop Paul Sulkosky
when he became infuriated with the
publicity being earned by Howard
and Cherberg and started for the
goal-line, 23 yards away, oil light
tackle.
Cards Forget Selves
The Indians did forget themselves
and become ungentlemanly enough
to score on two occasions, and since
the first one came before Washing
ton had tallied, it appeared for a
while that Warner's men were
thinking of Pop instead of Phelan.
Hard-working Phil Baker, who car
ried the ball 24 times during the
afternoon and averaged 2.0 yards
and who shone among the Card
backs, went over from the 9-inch
line after a 47-yard march.
A perfect Baker to Doub to Cad
del forward-lateral had gained 15
of the 47, Caddel bumping himself
out-of-bounds on the 20-yard line
against Cherberg, and doing it so
well that the Washington safety
man had to take time out. And that
was the only first half thrill except
a 28-yard run by Bill Sim made
possible by a perfect open-field
block by Ted Kite.
Late Rally Fails
Then the first-half gridiron classic
of soaring 35-yard punts and spec
tacular 3-yard runs became a foot
ball game worth watching as Wash
ington scored her unexpected three
touchdowns. And then the game
turned into a real thriller as Stan
ford stopped being gentlemanly and
started to play football.
There were but five minutes left
to play and Phelan had shown (hat
he appreciated the Indians' lr In ess
by sending in all of his remaining
substitutes at once. Passing on every
play, Stanford finally connected with
that old Allen-to-Colvin combina
tion and Don scored on the play,
Bill Cor bus, who as usual played
football all day. kicked the goal and
the count was 18 to 13. But there
wasn't time to .core again, although
Stanford's real superiority was ap
parent in that final rally.
Not Bates' Fault
It wasn't Bates' fault that Stanford
lost. When the gigantic crowd of
7,000 came mournfully out of the
Stadium offering their Big Game
tickets to anyone who would buy, it
was .Bates (particularly for his
blocking the first Washington at
tempt at conversion) along with
Cherberg and Nesbit and Howard
who was being lauded. And Bruce
Tarver, star of the Class of '34's
freshman team, looked like the
player he has always been in his
first varsity appearance.

real captain and a real football
player Saturday. And Stanford did

around. But Stanford's passes were
aimed at the ground or Washington
backs or centers. The score wasn't
larger because, as one rooter said,
''Washington can't catch them if
they're on the ground."
Out of kind consideration for
Jimmie Phelan's pocketbook, Stan
ford University's well-beaten In
dians obligingly and graciously lost
a game ot football to a mediocre but
alert group of University of Wash
ington Huskies, 13 to 18, Saturday
afternoon, and thus made it pos
sible for Phelan to cancel his ru
mored reservations for a comfort
able Pullman ride back East. Phe
lan, who has not produced teams as
his material apparently warranted
and his alumni vociferously insisted,
seemed headed for the coaches'
showers, until Stanford's better team
lost to a team that played better
football.
In fact, the play of the Stanford
eleven throughout the afternoon
was marked by generous conduct
becoming a Stanford gentleman.
They stood around and timed
Johnny Cherberg on an 88-yard
touchdown sprint, they completed
an unprecedented number of Stan
ford to Washington passes, and they
even allowed a center to score
against them.
An Unorthodox Center
When Colin Howard, Washington
center who has been brought up
incorrectly and does not know his
proper place among the blocking and
tackling slaves of the forward line,
decided, contrary to the best pre
cepts and highest ideals of football
as established by the great teams of
the past and the present, that he
wished to run 58 yards for a touch
down, Stanford didn't stop him.
And when Cherberg caught one
of Stan Anderson's best punts on
his own 12-yard line and started
out on a touchdown jaunt, Stanford
didn't stop him either. Finally,
Stanford didn't stop Paul Sulkosky
when he became infuriated with the
publicity being earned by Howard
and Cherberg and started for the
goal-line, 23 yards away, oil light
tackle.
Cards Forget Selves
The Indians did forget themselves
and become ungentlemanly enough
to score on two occasions, and since
the first one came before Washing
ton had tallied, it appeared for a
while that Warner's men were
thinking of Pop instead of Phelan.
Hard-working Phil Baker, who car
ried the ball 24 times during the
afternoon and averaged 2.0 yards
and who shone among the Card
backs, went over from the 9-inch
line after a 47-yard march.
A perfect Baker to Doub to Cad
del forward-lateral had gained 15
of the 47, Caddel bumping himself
out-of-bounds on the 20-yard line
against Cherberg, and doing it so
well that the Washington safety
man had to take time out. And that
was the only first half thrill except
a 28-yard run by Bill Sim made
possible by a perfect open-field
block by Ted Kite.
Late Rally Fails
Then the first-half gridiron classic
of soaring 35-yard punts and spec
tacular 3-yard runs became a foot
ball game worth watching as Wash
ington scored her unexpected three
touchdowns. And then the game
turned into a real thriller as Stan
ford stopped being gentlemanly and
started to play football.
There were but five minutes left
to play and Phelan had shown (hat
he appreciated the Indians' lr In ess
by sending in all of his remaining
substitutes at once. Passing on every
play, Stanford finally connected with
that old Allen-to-Colvin combina
tion and Don scored on the play,
Bill Cor bus, who as usual played
football all day. kicked the goal and
the count was 18 to 13. But there
wasn't time to .core again, although
Stanford's real superiority was ap
parent in that final rally.
Not Bates' Fault
It wasn't Bates' fault that Stanford
lost. When the gigantic crowd of
7,000 came mournfully out of the
Stadium offering their Big Game
tickets to anyone who would buy, it
was .Bates (particularly for his
blocking the first Washington at
tempt at conversion) along with
Cherberg and Nesbit and Howard
who was being lauded. And Bruce
Tarver, star of the Class of '34's
freshman team, looked like the
player he has always been in his
first varsity appearance.
Acting-Captain Bill Doub was a
real captain and a real football
player Saturday. And Stanford did
move the big blimp, Isaacson,
around. But Stanford's passes were
aimed at the ground or Washington
backs or centers. The score wasn't
larger because, as one rooter said,
