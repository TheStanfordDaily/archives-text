# AN OPEN LETTER TO THE HUSKIES
## 
### 
As von probably have noticed in Ihe papers, Washing
ton, a few persons hereabouts have been pretty tree with
the alibis concerning Saturday's game. They have been
saying, "We had the better team, but we lost the game on
breaks."
There are others of us, however, who always have
naively supposed that the reason we have games tit all is
to decide which teams are better. Kleven men might wear
the cleanest of jerseys, and run the fastest, and be the big
gest, and hit the hardest, and carry the ball the most yards,
and kick it the farthest. Hut if all those fine actions were
to go for naught, with those eleven men gelling the short
end of the score, why, that always has been proof enough
that they really were second best.
After all, the whole object of the game is to cross the
goal line with the hall, not to look well on the field. And
when a team proves itself by doing Iha|, the question of
merit should be a settled one.
Hut it doesn't seem to be. "The breaks," say the Alibi
Ikes "they won on the breaks." Hut those little things
that often make great victories usually aren't breaks at
all. They may show that a man lacks training, or is asleep,
or 100 slow, bill they aren't just plain luck. And when a
team plays heads up football and takes quick advantage
of the opponents' mistakes, it is doing nothing more than
demonstrating one of the qualities that go to make up good
grid outfits.
And so, Washington (and. you can pass tl is along to
I'.S.C. and t'.C-.L.A. loo), don't listen to any of these alibi
experts You had the best eleven on the field for that hour
of playing, and you won fairly and squarely, brink from
the cup of victory.

During one of the inlra-mural football games played
lasl Friday, a student suffered a broken leg, the final
casualty on a long list of minor hurts received by various
contestants. This serious injury brings to a head the (pies
lion of what rules or precautions should be applied to the
game as it is played here at Stanford.
There are two alternatives which might be used either
change the rules so that the rougher elements of the game
shall be eliminated, or supply standard equipment to the
players. This latter provision seems lo be particularly
impractical in this day and age. The change of rules
proposition, however, is open for consideration.
In many eastern colleges, where inlra-mural sports
have reached approximately the same level of develop
ment and organization as those on the Farm, blocking
has been barred, and a 'dead ball" rule has been estab
lished. These conditions put all the emphasis on running
and passing the features of the game which supply the
desired exercise.
I he Daii.v is in complete sympathy with the principle
of inlra-mural sports, and more particularly the way Ihev
are organized at Stanford. However, common sense should
be used noin before a fatal injury lays the I Diversity open
lo the charge of unpardonable carelessness.
