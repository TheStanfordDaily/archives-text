A lew months ago it was I he 4 blase playboy of American
politics who came to California expressly to plead the
cause of Tom Mooney. Today the pugnacious bad bov of
American Literature is here for the same purpose.
The highest court in the stale put Mooney in prison.
.\nd three successive governors of California have refused
him pardon. Refore each of these the evidence lias been
reviewed and rc-revicwd. legal technicalities have been
argued by attorneys and judges who have been a part of
the case for tifteen years, and Mooney has been refused
his freedom.
Vet Jim my Walker, when his own affairs in New York
were getting out of hand, came to California to tell the
world why Tom Mooney should be given liberty. And now
it's Theodore Dreiser, the man who gained attention by
writing "American Tragedy" and by slapping Sinclair
Lewis' face.
Whether or not the visits of Walker and Dreiser will
have any effect upon the final outcome of the case, they
are performing an invaluable service. California got into
the Mooney mess by taking il too seriously at the start. In
fact the whole country got into il by allowing a certain
element to construe into a cause the arrest and imprison
ment of a proved undesirable citizen.
The ironic humor of attempts by Walker, Ihe play boy,
and Dreiser, Ihe bad boy. lo solve a case that has stumped
attorneys, judges, and governors for years will certainly
add that touch necessary to turn Ihe Mooney affair into
just another of the comedies that go lo make up Ihe con
cept of Amrricaiut-
