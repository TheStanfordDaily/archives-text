# BULL SESSION
## COLLEGIATE MOVIES 
### 
It's the old rah rah game! The
producers down at Hollywood
learned it about seven years ago,
and like elephants they never forget.
The old college life formula is
dusted off and mustered into action
every so often. And when the
formula is modified to escape prose
cution under the plagiarism laws,
the background remains the same.
And that background tends to re
main in the foreground with some I
very amusing and peculiar results. T
To show a typical campus, the i
producer feels obligated to do sev
eral typical "shots." First, countless !
numbers of unemployed New York j
follies girls bedecked in the very i
best college tradition aimlessly '
strolling about a quad. In reality, j
everyone knows that no campus can j
boast so many "hot-cha-cha" j
blondes—many college men's wishes
and hopes to the contrary. Second, j
equal numbers of frisking couples
aimlessly necking in every corner I
but the Prexy's clothes closet.
Third, a worse-than-average pro- j
fessor aimlessly lecturing on a most j
arid subject to a class of the most j
stupid, gay-sweatered imbeciles that i
the casting office can collect and j
the costumer can fit. All these things i
may have a small grain of truth; j
but no one seems to blush at the
wholesale exaggeration and hope- j
less perversion. The worst part is j
that so often has this picture been |
painted that everyone is coming to
believe it!
Those people who only come to I
college to see the big games accept
the stuff as gospel truth. T.c-.-ry
speed cop and small-town judge is
sure that a restraining fist must be |
placed in every offending collegian's :
midriff. He feels that it is. a positive |

duty (as well as a positive pleasure).
Every college man must suffer for
every offense committed by Holly
wood "juveniles" in their mad races
, across the silver screen.
But more important is the pollut
ing effect that these pictures have ]
on collegians themselves. Many uni
| versity students begin to feel an
I obligation to approximate the cellu- I
loid antics of what is originally sup- '
' posed to be a reproduction of their 1
! own lives. The box office ideals that j
! Hollywood has dished up come to j
be the ideals upon which collegians j
! feast. This is particularly evident j
j with freshmen and sophomores.
I They come to college with a half
| cocked notion of what the score is.
j Some of them never get over it.
The freshman feels a solemn ob
j ligation to find his lcctures boring;
I and as they don't listen like a foot
ball coach's "pep" talk, he usually
I finds little difficulty in fulfilling his j
| obligation. It is Traditionally movie- i
l ish that students rebel at the very
; sight of textbooks; that duty also
| must be carried out with fervor,
j And as textbooks are usually not
i particularly thrilling, that Hollywood
j engendered disgust at books is ex
i pected.
But poor Hollywood, owned by
j New York bankers trying to make
I six per cent on their investment, is
not alone to blame. The ordinary,
eve.yday standards are carried j
| over to the university. Those stand- j
i ards are typically babbittish and I
anti-cultural in the extreme. To
j hope that college can be something
j different—something different and
! inspiring—is a worthwhile dream ,
| that some like myself enjoy indulg- !
: ing in—but probably is nothing
j more. —Abe Mellinkoff

The old college life formula is
dusted off and mustered into action

To show a typical campus, the i

numbers of unemployed New York j
follies girls bedecked in the very i

strolling about a quad. In reality, j
everyone knows that no campus can j
boast so many "hot-cha-cha" j

equal numbers of frisking couples
aimlessly necking in every corner I

Third, a worse-than-average pro- j
fessor aimlessly lecturing on a most j
arid subject to a class of the most j
stupid, gay-sweatered imbeciles that i
the casting office can collect and j
the costumer can fit. All these things i
may have a small grain of truth; j

wholesale exaggeration and hope- j
less perversion. The worst part is j
that so often has this picture been |

Every college man must suffer for
