'THE PHANTOM OF CREST -
WOOD" (Radio) at the Varsity
Theatre
Here is a closely knit mystery
yarn which is given a fine produc
tion at the hands of a sane direc
tor and a clever cast. It is the un
usual mystery, in that it employs
relatively few of the ancient con
ventional thriller-film devices. The
excitement does not depend on ex
ternals; this is essentially an in
telligent story.
Jenny Wrenn. notorious black
maileress, is murdered at a house
party to which are invited ten peo
ple, any one of whom would have
reason to kill her.
Suspicion, true to the tradition
of mysteries, is successively di
rected at each member of the party,
and the denouement, though not
wholly unexpected, is at least re
plete with thrills and a fine ele
ment of suspense.
The reason that the film fails to
become ridiculous, as many of the
type succeed in doing, is the qual
ity of the cast assigned to enact it.
Pauline Frederick is easily the out
standing player, and she handles a
thankless role with her characteris
tic finesse, imbuing it with much
power.
Karen Morley, who impresses
anew with each performance, con
tributes another of her excellently
poised heroines. Miss Morley's
voice is perhaps the finest among
any of the newer actresses.
Ricardo Cortez, in an unexacting
role, is adequate, and resists a
temptation to overact. Anita Louise
and Matty Kemp, as the young lov
ers, are exceptionally able; Skeets
Gallagher's comedy, though soft
ened, is still there—and good.
