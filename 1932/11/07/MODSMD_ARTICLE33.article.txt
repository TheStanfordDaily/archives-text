The Editor, Sir:
In the editorial column of Friday's
Daily, you characterized the "vie- I
torious Bruin" as "the greatest of !
all good sports, a good winner." An- I
other column of the paper carried :
a story concerning our estimable j
halfback, Caddel, who, it appears,!
sentenced a frosh to hours at the
Convalescent Home for a good- !
( natured remark about the "Lion- |
man" episode. If I am not mistaken, !
' this occurrence is worthy of some j
! comment in your column, since such :
( a treatment would have more effect j
than a campus opinion letter.
I believe it should be called to
Caddel's attention that there is also
; a type of good sport called a good
loser. Do you suppose the in
question would be under sentence i
now if Caddel had secured his $1000 1
contract?
It was my understanding that the j
office of sponsor at Encina was one (
of some dignity; that the powers I
placed in his hands were to be used j
' in the preservation of order in the j
; hall and in the punishment of un- j
1 reasonable acts, not for the reinfla
-1 tion of a punctured ego by a poor !
i sport who is so small that he cannot
| take a little kidding in addition to
| that which he receives from his fra
j ternity brothers.
Cannot something be done to bring
i about cancellation of this sentence? i
I I sincerely hope you will try, at j
least.
Yours, Hugh J. Peat, '33
