, The Editor, Sir:
Many voters find it totally im- j
| possible to cast their ballots for any j
!of the three candidates for United |
States Senator whose names appear ;
on the ballot. I should like to sug- ;
gest that the intelligent solution to j
the problem presented by the nomi
nation of the three totally unaccept- ,
able candidates, is to write in the j
name of the Socialist candidate,
George R. Kirkpatrick. His name j
must be written in full, and can be ;
found on the ballot among the So- ;
cialist Presidential Electors, second
' on the list.
Sincerely yours, Daniel J. Gage, 7>6 '
