# Well Matched Teams Fight to Tie in Little Big Game
## FINAL SCORE 7-7 AS INDIANS TALLY IN LAST QUARTER Muddy Field Hinders Light Papoose Team; Blower Stars For U.C. 
### Bob Wade 
A light, fast Stanford Indian
freshman football team encountered
a sullen, determined Bear Cub
eleven in the California Memorial
Stadium Saturday afternoon, and
came away with a 7-7 tie in the
annual Little Big Game.
Playing on a wet field for the first
lime, and finding a line that could
give them all the competition they
wanted, the baby Redshirts resorted
to quick slabs and tight defense in
an effort to keep their victory col
umn clear for the season.
On a dry field, the story might
have been different, but the final
outcome was exactly what the play
of both teams demanded. They both
earned a tie.
Frosh Threaten Early
Stanford opened the scoring threat
activities early in the initial period,
when the yuarlings staged a march
to the Cub five-yard line, after an
exchange of punts. But California
held and Captain Floyd Blower
kicked out of danger. Grayson, no
ticeably bothered by the slippery
field, managed to run it back to the
Bear 25-yard marker, but Blower
intercepted a pass on his own 15
and kicked out of his territory
again.
Stanford was in a hole twice, due
to the fine punting of Blower and
some timely penalties by the referee,
but the Redshirts staged the only
real drive of the quarter.
Rouble Loss Weakens
The second quarter was much like
the first, with Stanford driving deep
into the Gold and Blue territory,
only to have the Cub line check its
advance when a scorc seemed im
minent.
An injury to Larry Rouble, early
in the second period, weakened the
line to some extent, but Pinotti,
who replaced him, stopped every
thing sent his way. The freshman
team was outweighed about iwelve
pounds to the man, and in the face
of this disadvantage, the line play
in particular was exceptionally
good. Adams was outstanding at
right guard.
Blower Quick-Kicks
As the third quarter got under
way, Stanford was caught Hen-footed
as Biower got off the only quick
kick of the day to the Card 20-yard
stripe. Hamilton recaptured 27 off
t;ickle but California tightened, and
kicked out. Stanford failed to gain
and Alustiza booted the ball to the
Bear 8-yard line.
Blower punted ba>_k again, the
ball got away from Gray; on, and
California recovered on Us own 35.
The Cubs started moving down the
field, and only stopped when Ham
ilton caught Blower on the Stan
ford 22. The Cards held, and on |
fourth down Blower faded back and j
passed to Dave Potter for the first i
score of the game. Jack Brittingham, j
who was outstanding at right end j
for California, converted.
Cal Opens Attack
The Cubs fought Stanford to a
standstill, until, with five minutes |
left, Quarterback Lewis threw a;
pass from his own 10-yard line to j
Hamilton on the 45, and Bones gal
loped the remaining distance. Monk J
Moscrip kicked goal.
California opened up with a wild
passing attack, and carried to Stan
ford's twenty, where the yearlings I
took the ball on downs. Alustiza,
outstanding for Stanford ;dl after- 1
noon, carried the ball on the last ,
three plays of the game, and had j
advanced it 43 yards when the final >
pun popped.

exchange of punts. But California
held and Captain Floyd Blower
kicked out of danger. Grayson, no
ticeably bothered by the slippery
field, managed to run it back to the
Bear 25-yard marker, but Blower
intercepted a pass on his own 15
and kicked out of his territory
again.
Stanford was in a hole twice, due
to the fine punting of Blower and
some timely penalties by the referee,
but the Redshirts staged the only
real drive of the quarter.
Rouble Loss Weakens
The second quarter was much like
the first, with Stanford driving deep
into the Gold and Blue territory,
only to have the Cub line check its
advance when a scorc seemed im
minent.
An injury to Larry Rouble, early
in the second period, weakened the
line to some extent, but Pinotti,
who replaced him, stopped every
thing sent his way. The freshman
team was outweighed about iwelve
pounds to the man, and in the face
of this disadvantage, the line play
in particular was exceptionally
good. Adams was outstanding at
right guard.
Blower Quick-Kicks
As the third quarter got under
way, Stanford was caught Hen-footed
as Biower got off the only quick
kick of the day to the Card 20-yard
stripe. Hamilton recaptured 27 off
t;ickle but California tightened, and
kicked out. Stanford failed to gain
and Alustiza booted the ball to the
Bear 8-yard line.
Blower punted ba>_k again, the
ball got away from Gray; on, and
California recovered on Us own 35.
The Cubs started moving down the
field, and only stopped when Ham
ilton caught Blower on the Stan
ford 22. The Cards held, and on |
fourth down Blower faded back and j
passed to Dave Potter for the first i
score of the game. Jack Brittingham, j
who was outstanding at right end j
for California, converted.
Cal Opens Attack
The Cubs fought Stanford to a
standstill, until, with five minutes |
left, Quarterback Lewis threw a;
pass from his own 10-yard line to j
Hamilton on the 45, and Bones gal
loped the remaining distance. Monk J
Moscrip kicked goal.
California opened up with a wild
passing attack, and carried to Stan
ford's twenty, where the yearlings I
took the ball on downs. Alustiza,
outstanding for Stanford ;dl after- 1
noon, carried the ball on the last ,
three plays of the game, and had j
advanced it 43 yards when the final >
pun popped.
A light, fast Stanford Indian
freshman football team encountered
a sullen, determined Bear Cub
eleven in the California Memorial
Stadium Saturday afternoon, and
came away with a 7-7 tie in the
annual Little Big Game.
Playing on a wet field for the first
lime, and finding a line that could
give them all the competition they
wanted, the baby Redshirts resorted
to quick slabs and tight defense in
an effort to keep their victory col
umn clear for the season.
On a dry field, the story might
have been different, but the final
outcome was exactly what the play
of both teams demanded. They both
earned a tie.
Frosh Threaten Early
Stanford opened the scoring threat
activities early in the initial period,
when the yuarlings staged a march
to the Cub five-yard line, after an
exchange of punts. But California
held and Captain Floyd Blower
kicked out of danger. Grayson, no
ticeably bothered by the slippery
field, managed to run it back to the
