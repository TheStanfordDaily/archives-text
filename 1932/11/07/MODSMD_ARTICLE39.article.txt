# HIS HUSKIES BEAT STANFORD INDIANS
## 
### 

Coach Jimmic Phelan, whose varsity scored the first Washington
victory over Stanford since the days ol" George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau.
The Huskies made two of their touchdowns on a punt return and a pass
interception, and one in a tricky reverse, to vindicate Phelan's claim to
the best team at the Seattle institution since 1925.
