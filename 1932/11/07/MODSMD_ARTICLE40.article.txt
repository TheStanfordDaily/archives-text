W E L L, CALI F O II N I A S
FRESHMAN team got a tie
out of the battle, but the ar
[ ticle from Berkeley that got
| into the city papers was about
! the most foolish thing that I
have ever seen. To say that
California stopped Stanford's
intricate running attack is idi
otic. California didn't have a
chance to see Stanford's trick
plays. That fancy California
field took care of any shiftiness
that might have been shown by
either team. M L I) stopped
Stanford's reverses!
California has a fine freshman
team, and the field was just suited
to their style of play. They v/ere
heavier; they depended on their
weight and power for their ad
vances, and they made both tell.
But they DID NOT fight the Car
dinal frosh ofl their feet by any
means.
Just to pick on a couple of the
misstatements: It was Hamilton
that came out into the open against
the Cub safety man twice, NOT
Grayson. The first time, with a
Cub right on his heels, Bones tried
to cut between them, slipped and
was already down before the safe
ty man laid a hand on him. The
second time. Hamilton didn't even
try to swei've, but piled into the
safety for whatever extra yards he
could get out of it. — When Dave
Potter scored his touchdown, he
carried a man across the line with
him. It was good work on Potter's

I part that made the score possible,
NOT dumbness on the part of the
Card secondary. And, my little
; playfellow, there were five good
minutes left when the baby Red
shirts scored. Both teams had time
to do plenty after the Cards tied
' the score!!!!
<$i <«>
AS A REWARD FOR THEIR
fine play during the season. Bob
"Bones" Hamilton and Larry
Kouhie were elected honorary
co-captains of the team, at a
banquet held after the Little
Big Game. Two mighty /fine
boys, mates; watch 'em go on
the varsity!

Stanford's reverses!
California has a fine freshman
team, and the field was just suited
to their style of play. They v/ere
heavier; they depended on their
weight and power for their ad
vances, and they made both tell.
But they DID NOT fight the Car
dinal frosh ofl their feet by any
means.
Just to pick on a couple of the
misstatements: It was Hamilton
that came out into the open against
the Cub safety man twice, NOT
Grayson. The first time, with a
Cub right on his heels, Bones tried
to cut between them, slipped and
was already down before the safe
ty man laid a hand on him. The
second time. Hamilton didn't even
try to swei've, but piled into the
safety for whatever extra yards he
could get out of it. — When Dave
Potter scored his touchdown, he
carried a man across the line with
him. It was good work on Potter's

I part that made the score possible,
NOT dumbness on the part of the
Card secondary. And, my little
; playfellow, there were five good
minutes left when the baby Red
shirts scored. Both teams had time
to do plenty after the Cards tied
' the score!!!!

AS A REWARD FOR THEIR
fine play during the season. Bob
"Bones" Hamilton and Larry
Kouhie were elected honorary
co-captains of the team, at a
banquet held after the Little
Big Game. Two mighty /fine
boys, mates; watch 'em go on
the varsity!
