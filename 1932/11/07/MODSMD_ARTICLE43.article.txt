urday night at San Francisco, after
a strenuous session that lasted into ,
the wee small hours of Sunday ,
morning.
At 12 o'clock the Stanford fencers
were within one bout of a victory
and the meet seemed all but over.

prolonged the match until 2 o'clock,
when Fred Pearman climaxed a
stellar evening's work by defeating (
Adams, a former Stanford captain. >
Since this victory clinched the meet j
for Stanford, the final two bouts
were dropped by mutual agreement.
Leonard Poekman, John Fergu- |
son, and Fred Pearman each won
3 bouts out of 5 for Stanford and
might have been equaled by A1
Snyder and Hubert Chain had not j
their final bouts been the two that l

l were eliminated. As it was they each
j were credited with winning 2 out I
of 4.
Chain continued the excellent
pace that he began against Cali- ;
i fornia when 3 out of 5 bouts were j
i marked up in his favor. His work is j
j considered especially outstanding I
since it is his first year on the \
team and his skill had not been f
rated as equal to that of his more '
j experienced colleagues.
, Leicester and Uribsen were the
leading fencers for the Olympic !
( Club. Leicester lost his only bout
; to Fred Pearman, who later con
i tinued his good work by taking the
