## 
### BILL MYERS 
In its first public tryout, Stan
ford's re-vamped polo team thun
dered over the "second four" of the ,
varsity squad in a practice match
Friday, 9-1.
Dopesters who looked askance at !
the juggled and untried lineup for j
the varsity had their doubts an- j
swered when the Redshirts turned
in as fancy an exhibition of early j
season polo as has ever been played j
here. The team-work was smooth, j
shooting was accurate, and there
was a lot of "heady" playing.
Pete Gillham, captain of the team, j
fitted in well at his new post, num- j
ber thi*ee. This was Gillham's first :
match at one of the back positions. J
His mighty drives should make |
him an invaluable part of the Card |
defense.
Woody Melone, also starting at a j
new position, number one, ran j
away with the scoring, hanging up 1
five tallies alone. Rule Spalding and i
Johnny Myers scored one goal j
apiece, while Gillham made two.

Playing on the second team, Lup
pon and Robb turned in flashy
games, but their teammates, Gil- |
lingham and Maer, seemed to be !
having an off day and gave them
little support. Lvippen scored the j
lone goal for the second string. j
