# TRANSFER JUMPS SENSATIONALLY IN FRIDAY TRACKFEST
## 
### Albert Guerard 
Stanford's high jumping weakness
may be remedied for three years at
least.
This cheerful possibility was real
ized by spectators at last Friday's
intersquad track meet when a
Nevada University transfer, Arthur
by name, high-jumped G feet, 2%
inches, just three-quarters of >an
inch higher than any other Stan
ford jumper has soared in the last
four years. A major portion of
Stanford's track and field aspira
tions for the 1932 campaign will de
pend on the eligibility of Arthur,
who may not get to compete because
he transferred so recently.
Other promising Indian jumpers
are Lloyd Sehween, a sophomore
who tied Bob King's Little Big Meet
record at 6 feet, 2 inches, and Don
Albertsen, a freshman, who jumped
5 feet, 11% inches at Palo Alto High
School. Sehween added a full two
inches to his previous best mark
while competing for the freshmen
last year, while Coach Bill Elling
ton considers Albertsen one of his
most promising pupils. Ellington has
coached Albertsen since the Palo
Alto athlete was competing in light
weight track meets.
Ben Eastman showed the same
speed that has carried him to count
less victories during the last three
years. Ben won the 100 in 10.3 and
the 220 in 22 flat, barely nosing out
the fast-improving Phil Williams in
the latter race. A1 Blaekman won
the 440 in 51.3, while Sam Eastman
.showed great promise in running a
2:02.5 half-mile.
Gus Meier won both hurdle races
in good early-season time, while
Nellie Gray almost reached 50 feet
in winning the shot-put.
