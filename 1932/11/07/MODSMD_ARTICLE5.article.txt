## Traffic Regulations Made For Hoover Reception 
### 
Palo Alto and Stanford leaders in
charge of making final preparations
to insure a smooth-working recep
tion for President Hoover tomorrow
afternoon have requested that stu
dents remain on the campus until
President Hoover reaches the Quad.
If Stanford residents attempted to
attend the Palo Alto reception and
then to return in time to see the
Chief Executive welcomed at the
student reception, serious conges
tion would result in spite of pre
cautionary regulations laid down by
traffic officials.
University Avenue, Alma Street,
and Palm Drive will be completely
closed to traffic, and spaces for spec
tators will be roped off near the
Community House.

A guard of honor from the Palo
Alto Post of the American Legion
will escort the official party from the
Community House across the high
way to the Stanford Gates at the
lower end of Palm Drive.
Committees preparing for the
President's arrival, anticipate that a
large number of school children will
want to get a glimpse of the Presi
dent, so they have planned for the
school groups to line Palm Drive be
tween the highway and the Quad.
Automobiles and busses conveying
the children will be permitted to
park in the Arboretum.
The space around the Oval in
front of the Quad will be kept en
tirely clear, and students are urged
to park their cars as far as possible
from the scene of the reception. San
Juan Hill will be roped off com
pletely from automobile traffic.
Plentiful Protection
Secret service officials superin
tended the installation of flood lights
and other safeguards around the
Hoover home yesterday, while tele
graph and telephone employes skill
fully wove the many lines of com
munication which will keep the
President in touch with the coun
try.
Captain T. B. Foster, head of the
United States Secret Service at San
Francisco, is in charge of measures
here for the protection of the Presi
dent. Captain Foster stated yester
day that he would assign guards to
augment the President's regular
secret service detail.
