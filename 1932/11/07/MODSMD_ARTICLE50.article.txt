# THREE STRONG EASTERN ELEVENS RIVAL S.C. FOR GRID CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Southern California, Pittsburgh, |
Michigan, and Tennessee continued j
their march toward national cham- j
pionship honors with impressive i
victories in Saturday afternoon I
games. In the East, Colgate, Brown, j
and Columbia remained undefeated i
and untied, but the once-defeated
Army eleven was more impressive j
in defeating Harvard by a 46-0
score.
Pennsylvania, Holy Cross, and i
Virginia Polytechnic Institute fell '
for the first time during the 1932 j
campaign. The Penn Quakers gave ,
Pittsburgh, conquerors of Notre ;
Dame, a great battle, but lost 19-12. |
Holy Cross outplayed Brown, but j
relaxed long enough in the fourth j
quarter to give Brown a 10-7 vie- •
tory Virginia Poly lost to Alabama
9-6.
Trojans Impressive
More impressive than in any pre- j
vious game, U.S.C.'s Trojans whip- j
ped California 27-7, and appear to j
have an excellent chance of main- j
taining their perfect record until |
December 10 at least, when they j
meet Notre Dame in the Olympic i
Stadium.
Pittsburgh's victory over Pennsyl- j
vania means that the Panthers will
probably still be undefeated when
they play Stanford. While their in
tersectional rivals were beating an !
undefeated team, the Indians drop- j
ped their third straight game, this

| one to Washington, 18-13.
Only Chicago and Minnesota
j stand in Michigan's path to a Big
i Ten title. The Wolverines had a
i hard time defeating Indiana 7-0, but
| will probably not have as much
i trouble in their next two contests.
Of the undefeated and untied
I teams, University of Tennessee has
1 (he hardest battle ahead of her.
j Next Saturday the Volunteers play
I Vanderbilt University's Commo
j dores, and if ever two teams were
j evenly matched, they are the 1932
i editions of these two Tennessee
j teams. The State University is at
| Knoxville while Vanderbilt's home
i gridiron is at Nashville.
Pittsburgh vs. S.C.?
At the present writing it appears
almost certain that the Western
| representative in the New Year's
'Rose Bowi game will be Southern
: California, with Pittsburgh or Ten
j nessee her likely opponent. Because
j it has been quite a few years since
j a Big Ten team has played in a
j Rose Bowl classic, Michigan may get
i the call, but either the Panthers or
I the Tennessee Volunteers would
( prove a greater gate attraction,
i The Bay Region's trio of Catholic
universities could win only one
[game between them. Foidham up
: set St. Mary's in an intersectional
(game; Gonzaga defeated San Fran
j cisco University; and Santa Clara
trampled Pacific.

and Columbia remained undefeated i
and untied, but the once-defeated
Army eleven was more impressive j
in defeating Harvard by a 46-0
score.
Pennsylvania, Holy Cross, and i
Virginia Polytechnic Institute fell '
for the first time during the 1932 j
campaign. The Penn Quakers gave ,
Pittsburgh, conquerors of Notre ;
Dame, a great battle, but lost 19-12. |
Holy Cross outplayed Brown, but j
relaxed long enough in the fourth j
quarter to give Brown a 10-7 vie- •
tory Virginia Poly lost to Alabama
9-6.
Trojans Impressive
More impressive than in any pre- j
vious game, U.S.C.'s Trojans whip- j
ped California 27-7, and appear to j
have an excellent chance of main- j
taining their perfect record until |
December 10 at least, when they j
meet Notre Dame in the Olympic i
Stadium.
Pittsburgh's victory over Pennsyl- j
vania means that the Panthers will
probably still be undefeated when
they play Stanford. While their in
tersectional rivals were beating an !
undefeated team, the Indians drop- j
ped their third straight game, this

| one to Washington, 18-13.
Only Chicago and Minnesota
j stand in Michigan's path to a Big
i Ten title. The Wolverines had a
i hard time defeating Indiana 7-0, but
| will probably not have as much
i trouble in their next two contests.
Of the undefeated and untied
I teams, University of Tennessee has
1 (he hardest battle ahead of her.
j Next Saturday the Volunteers play
I Vanderbilt University's Commo
j dores, and if ever two teams were
j evenly matched, they are the 1932
i editions of these two Tennessee
j teams. The State University is at
| Knoxville while Vanderbilt's home
i gridiron is at Nashville.
Pittsburgh vs. S.C.?
At the present writing it appears
almost certain that the Western
| representative in the New Year's
'Rose Bowi game will be Southern
: California, with Pittsburgh or Ten
j nessee her likely opponent. Because
j it has been quite a few years since
j a Big Ten team has played in a
j Rose Bowl classic, Michigan may get
i the call, but either the Panthers or
I the Tennessee Volunteers would
( prove a greater gate attraction,
i The Bay Region's trio of Catholic
universities could win only one
[game between them. Foidham up
: set St. Mary's in an intersectional
(game; Gonzaga defeated San Fran
j cisco University; and Santa Clara
trampled Pacific.
Southern California, Pittsburgh, |
Michigan, and Tennessee continued j
their march toward national cham- j
pionship honors with impressive i
