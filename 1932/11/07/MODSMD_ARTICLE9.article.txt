# Lowell High Trims Card Frosh Reserves 29 To 0
## 
### 
Completely outclassed by a better
organized football squad, the Stan
' ford freshman reserves took a 20
! to 0 defeat from the Lowell High
i team last Saturday morning. Brig
ham and Cedros starred for the
visitors with spectacular running
and passing.
Stanford's only chance to score
came late in the last quarter when
the yearlings carried the ball to
their opponents' 15-yard line. A pass
over the goal line fell incomplete as
, the game ended.
