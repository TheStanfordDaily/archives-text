Jumes Jacobs of U.S.C., was the
first speaker, upholding the Hoover
regime. He commenced by bom
barding his opponents with such
puns and wise cracks that his Demo
cratic teammate, Clinton Jones, pro
ceeded to threaten him with .» little
red axe he had brought to honor
the Indians. Whereupon Jacobs ex
plained that since this was to be a
split debate, his colleague had
brought the axe to split the teams.
"And," he continued, "on the boat
coming up here, he was so eager
lor Roosevelt's 'new deal' that he
nearly split the deck."
Flays Roosevelt
Jacobs then proceeded to base his
case on the Hoover measures to end
the depression, flayed Roosevelt for
bank failures in New York State,
and dismissed the governor's tree
planting program as an attempt to
"put the Republicans in the shade." i
Wolf, first speaker of the nega- 1
live, indicated the present adminis- j
I rat ion for its concept of government. !
He contended that the doctrine of j
individualism was no longer ten- '
able, and that the Republicans had |
failed to inspire in the people faith i
in their government. He accused I
them of having educated the people |
to materialism rather than social
progress, and asked that the Demo- j
crats should take over the govern- i
mcnt to change this status quo.
Ray Wilbur, in the first debate of ! ;
his career, pleaded that the voter j
should go to the polls "to decidc I
m the presence of God the most im- j
portant campaign in our history"— |
ind vote lor Herbert Hoover.
The last speaker, Clinton Jones, j
•pened his attack on the Hoover j
defenders with another bombard- I
nent of puns, in which he predicted ;
hat once the U.S. mint was turning '
Hit new 25 cent pieces, the Republi- i
•ans would soon be claiming "new j
lope from a new quarter."

regime. He commenced by bom
barding his opponents with such
puns and wise cracks that his Demo
cratic teammate, Clinton Jones, pro
