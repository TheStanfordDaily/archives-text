To aid new Stanford students in
becoming oriented to their new situ
ations and to help them in" deciding
upon their life vocations are the
aims of the Student Committee of
Stanford University, composed of
Fred Addicott, Sam Bradshaw, Mort
Fuller, Rob Gengnagel, Phil Ken
nedy, Bill Saufly, Van Vandermast,
and Frank Lloyd, chairman. Dr.
Wrenn who is in charge of voca
tional guidance at Stanford, is pre
senting the following articles under
the title of "Student Problem Aids."
To the Student—
"A university staff includes a
number of men and women whose
main function is to assist students
with their problems. Sometimes stu
dents consider a university as an
impersonal organization, but this is
often the result of the students' in
complete acquaintanceship with the
individuals who exist to make the

i, university a personal influence.
"This bulletin is an analysis of the :
( 1 agencies and individuals in Stanford :
' University to whom you may apply j
for suggestions and help. It is not
; (he university representative's busi- i
f ness to look you up, but to help
t i you when this aid is requested. It
- is not university policy to pry un
, 1 duly into the student's life. The in- I
telligent man or woman, however, I
- trains himself to recognize the prob
lem facing him and to seek aid in '
• its solution before the difficulty be
comes acute. The indolent or un
duly sensitive student just drifts
i along until he is "called on the car
: pet," or until much harm results
, to his mental or emotional life. Your
■ first responsibility is to help your
i self, but you should know the indi- )
, viduals or books that might help you
and you should not be hesitant
■ about seeking help from those who i
• are trained for this work."
