# Coolidge Boosts Hoover
## 
### 
Coolidge affirmed that "The situ
ation is too serious to employ a man
because he smiles at us and enter
tains us. We need to continue Presi
dent Hoover in office, because he
has demonstrated that he has a
clear understanding of present con
ditions. No other candidate has that
. . . The public is not deceived for
long . . . The voters soon recognize
the candidate who is sincere and
conscientious."
The President gave a short talk
from his private railroad car which
was stationed at Elko, Nevada, on
the journey here. His speech was
witnessed by a colorful throng of
rugged Westerners. Hoover spoke
of the responsibilities of leadership
of the greatest country on earth:
"the President has a power that is
a symbol of the might of the nation."
The Chief Executive stressed his
faith in democracy, the Republican
Party, and the American people.
He said, "This election will decide
the policies of this Republic not
only during the coming four years,
but perhaps for so many decades
that the results will affect our chil
dren and grandchildren."
