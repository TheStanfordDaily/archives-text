# President Due At 3:20 For Stanford Welcome; Both Nominees Confident
## Predict Roosevelt's Victory Despite Late Swing To G.O.P. Incumbent 
### Albert Guerard 
1 While the Republican Party is
j confident of victory, basing their
! expectations on a last-week shift of
I public enthusiasm to Herbert
I Hoover, nearly every pre-election
J factor which might be used as a
! basis for prediction points to the
j election today of Franklin D.
i Roosevelt, as President of the United
States.
Forty-seven million people have
, qualified to vote. Just how large a
| proportion of this vast army has
| decided to vote the Republican
1 ticket after previously expressing
! Democratic preference will not be
j known until very late tonight —
probably no definite conclusion will
!be reached until after Wednesday
j morning's newspapers have gene to
I press.
Hoover Swing
Republicans are depending on this
! one factor: the sudden and unpre-
I dieted swing toward President
j Hoover. Two weeks ago every legiti
mate factor worthy of consideration
I indicated a decisivp Democratic vie
1 tory. It was generally believed that
! the 7,000,000 popular plurality and
j44 electoral votes given Herbert
Hoovor over A1 Smith four years
ago would not only be wiped out
but an even larger margin polled
[ for the Roosevelt-Garner ticket.
Allowing for the heavy Repub
lican vote that has been secured
during the final days of the cam
paign, Democratic leaders feel ab
solutely sure of winning the elec
toral votes of 24 states (including
California —22 votes, and Texas —23
votes). This would give them a total
of 228 votes, or just 38 votes shy of
the 266 necessary. The Democratic
ticket concedes President Hoover
only ten states and 109 electoral
votes. Governor Roosevelt and
Speaker Garner believe that they
will have no trouble in gaining 38
votes from the remaining states that
have been labeled "doubtful."
Claim 338 Vote
Everett Sanders, Republican
chairman, predicted a minimum of
338 electoral votes for the Adminis
tration.
Democratic leaders point to the
indications of a Roosevelt victory as
shown by the Literary Digest poll,
remarkable for its accuracy of its
election prediction in 3924 and 1928.
Republicans have refuted this claim
by pointing out that later polls
(which would reflect the recent Re
publican swing) do not indica'2 any
pronounced Democratic advantage.
Socialists Gain
Managers of both parties concede
a big increase in the Socialist vote,
but do not anticipate enough Thom
as support for him to win the elec
toral votes of a single state.
Of the many themes of dispute
that have sharpened tension in the
closing days of the campaign, popu
