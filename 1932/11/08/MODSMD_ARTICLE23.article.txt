# S.C. Stadium Lease Not Exclusive, Bruins Claim
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7 (PIP)â€”
With photostatic evidence as proof,
the Southern Alumnus, magazine of
U.C.L.A. graduates, in its Novem
ber issue, accused the University of
Southern California of falsely claim
ing to have had an exclusive lease
on the Los Angeles Olympic Stad
ium during the last ten years.
Zack Farmer, secretary of the
Community Development Associa
tion, which controls the stadium,
stated: "The organization has never
made a lease of any kind to the Uni
versity of Southern California."
The U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. controversy
was aggravated by the petition of
Asa V. Call, secretary of the board
of trustees of the University of
Southern California, for the use of
the Olympic Stadium on Saturdays.
