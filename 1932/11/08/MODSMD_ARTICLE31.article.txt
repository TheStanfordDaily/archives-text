# THE 						HOMECOMING OF A PRESIDENT
## 
### 
It'll he (lie firs! public demonstration in a long lime!
which the Hallv (loinmitfee or somebody won't have to I
urge people lo attend this afternoon's. Stanford students!
Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, all will be lined up 1
on Palm Drive to welcome the President of the tinted
States lo the campus. They will be there because of that!
peculiar attraction which the great hold for the hordes.'
Thev will be there because, no matter through which pair
of partisan eyes the individual student looks upon the
situation, he is fully aware that he will be welcoming Stan
lord's most distinguished alumnus, Herbert Hoover.
It is significant, this return of Hoover's io the Farm on
election day. It indicates that the President still belongs!
to Stanford, and Ihe i Diversity to Hoover, that he is re
turning to the spot nearest his personal feelings at this
crisis in his career. The President evidently realizes that
on the campus he is among true friends If he wins the
election tonight he will find Ihe congratulatory handclasp
of Stanford just a little warmer than those he will en
counter elsewhere. And if he loses he'll still find the:
.
handclasp warmer, for, after all, Herbert Hoover is truly!
Stanford's favorite son.
