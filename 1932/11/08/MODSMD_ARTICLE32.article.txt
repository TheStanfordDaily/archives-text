I
Kvery year about 2.~>0 new sludcnls enter I lie upper di
vision. No one phiee is provided for these Stanford men
to live, 1 lie freslinien have I'neina, such as il is, hut the
transfer student is left to shift for himself. Men who have
heen at the I niversity for two years or more are often un
decided as to what line of work tliev should follow, and do!
not know anyone who can advise them on their particular'
case. These arc only two of the problems which a student
committee of eight men, who were appointed al the be
ginning of the year, are going to try and solve.
No one likes to ask strangers for information, especially 1
when those strangers seem to he well established and en
grossed in their own business. In the past it has taken!
some trajisfer students more than two quarters to feel that
they are an integral part of the liiivcrsity. In other words,
one-third of these Stanford men's college careers have had
a dark cloud hiini»i 1114 over them. This condition would
never have existed had these men known some one, pre-1
fcrably a student, who would have been prepared and glad
to talk over their particular situation.
This year's Student Committee would like every stu
dent to feel that he is free to tall- over any question al any
time with members of the Committee. New students par-!
licularly, who have been stmilling through the maze of
university organization and red-tape, should realize that
they will be warmly greeted by any of these men on the
(.ommitlee.
In another part of today's paper appears the tirst of a
series of articles prepared by Dr. Wren 11 as an aid to solv
ing student problems. Dr. Wrenn, whose oflice is on the
ground floor of the Administration Huilding, has been one
of the moving spirits behind all student aid at Stanford.
Il is rather significant that the door has been removed from
Dr. Wrenn's oflice. Drop around, you won't be sorrv.
