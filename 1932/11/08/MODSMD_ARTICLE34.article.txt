# BULL SESSION
## "BACK TO THE FARM" 
### 
Herbert C. Hoover, '95, a trustee j
i of the University—and incidentally
' President of the United States—re- 1
i turns to the Campus sometime this
afternoon. And by this return the
famous back-to-the-"Farm" move- i
mentis given unprecedented impe
j Lus! The return of "Stanford's Most
i Famous Alumnus" means many j
j things to many people. Enthusiastic
crowds—howling and clapping—will !
j welcome Hoover.

What will all this activity mean? J
Does it mean that there is a great |
| wave of governmental interest j
' sweeping the land? Clearly not. The
j great majority of people are not in- i
. terested in government, as such. It's !
! much too boring, unintelligible, and
J pointless. People are interested in |
i people—people make government— i
! to the mob (even to most of the I
j intelligencers). The Presidency '
means Herbert Hoover—not a thou- j
I sand and one duties, principles, and
j functions.
I
The skilled business executive
! must produce dollars. That is all
| that is required. No one cares about
| anything else. The government j
executive has a much more diffi
| cult job. He must produce results. (
j And in addition, he must symbolize
j the incomprehensible processes of
! government to the voters. Herbert
j Hoover—a man with a gray fedora—
: ii; something tangible that the voters
; can see on the rear platform of a '
j private car. Government is a three
syllabled word hidden in legal for
; mulae and red tape.
i , ,
That is why there is such a sud- j
! den fanning of interest during a
j presidential campaign. GoverniTftnt
j is changed from an institution to a
j race. It has all the punch of a com
| bined track meet and horse race— i
I and even more. Trains running all
| over the map—carrying hand-shak- I

ing, speech-making, luncheon-eat
ing candidates—is ordinary enough
to be meaningful and spectacular
enough to be interesting.
The same lack of interest in gov
ernment, however, is not changed
to any material extent. At present,
the Mythical Mfin from Mars would
surely get the impression that
democracy was indeed wonderful.
Some lifty million citizens have
registered—and will vote. The gov
ernment will respond to the electric
power of the ballot box. Govern
ment by the people will be vindi
cated.
But those of us who have the
sometimes dubious pleasure of liv
ing on the Earth rather than on
Mars know that unfortunately this
is not the case. We know that to
day, the votes have not yet been
counted; and the people are very
curious to know who will win. Just
as a smaller group will soon be in
terested in the outcome of a foot
ball game between this University
and the University of California.
Tomorrow, all will be changed.
The headquarters will be closed.
The speeches will end. The bunting
and banners will be stuffed in vari
ous trash receptacles. The news
papers will go back to crime, sex,
and sports with renewed vigor. The
national campaign will 'be at an
end. The people, no matter who
wins, will go back into political stag
nation and hibernationr—to snap
back to seeming life in 1936. At
least they always have!
But for all this, Mr. Hoover is of
course not to blame. He has just
finished a terrific campaign. He
closed his active fight in Nevada
and will vote on the campus today.
Welcome home!
