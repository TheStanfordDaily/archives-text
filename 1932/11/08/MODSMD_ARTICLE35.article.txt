THE COLLEGE FOLLIES—At the
Stanford Theatre.
In conjunction with the usual
picture show, Manager Harry j
Browne of the Stanford began io 1
feature a Saturday evening stage ,
show last week. Such familiar cam-
I pus names as Eph Engleman, Griff '
Williams, Winstead Weaver, and i
Burnell Gould were on the bill.
The audience—a fuil house of j
roughs—was amused even if the
stage show didn't go as smoothly as i
might be desired and despite the j
that bad timing and audience ex- !
I hibition made proper rendition of i
! the black-outs difficult.
Burnell Gould and "Robert Cath
! cart contributed a straggling politi- i
\ cal satire, the finish of which was a

little slow and obvious. Weaver
revived his hat stunt —less effective
than it was in last year's Gaieties.
The musical portions of the program
were best received: Griff Williams
and Eph Engleman working together
well with piano and violin.
This is an interesting weekly
stunt and, with more rehearsal,
should go over.
The film, "The Age of Consent,"
was received royally with howls and
cheers. It deserved all that, was in
nocently howling and, occasionally,
had good gags. —Sandoe
