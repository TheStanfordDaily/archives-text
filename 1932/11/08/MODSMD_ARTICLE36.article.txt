FROM TIIE "21"
The Editor, Sir:
I read with considerable interest
i in this morning's "L.A. Times" that
you were publicly advocating the
j use of the Stanford Axe as a Big
j Game trophy.
I was one of the chaps who had
; the pleasure of engaging in the
! "theft" of April 1930. 1 should like
l to say that I heartily endorse your
proposition.
I After the memorable event of
April 4, 1930, the "21" indulged in
I a hectic series of discussions as to
| the disposition of our unified sup
| port in achieving future employ
| ment for the Axe. However, we were
! never able to reach a unanimous
decision as several of us favored
; plans which were absolutely op
| posed (and on excellent grounds)
Iby the University Administration.
The trophy idea was among those
I discussed and I staunchly supported
!it at the time; and I believe that
I Loofbourow did also.
If this plan of yours is not car
ried out, I am afraid the Axe will
! soon become a forgotten fable. I
j wish you every success for your ef
i forts in this matter.
Very truly yours,
R. G. Snodgrass
