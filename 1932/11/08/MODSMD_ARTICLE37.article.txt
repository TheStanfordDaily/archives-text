# ONE AND ONLY

The Editor, Sir:
With busting pride, untempered
I and unrestrained by a decent sense
of modesty, I beg to burst forth in
this column (or must you insist on
"colyum") to nominate myself as
the "on? and only" for whom Dippy's
able MellinkofT has sought in vain.
Here's how: In a recent session of
"'Bull Session" Mr. MellinkofT in
discussing Democrats and Repub
licans and other such national bull
| topics, lamented that, "I have yet to
! find tho rollpgp student who has had
j a traditional parly allegiance
I changed by his college education."
j But here is my story:
In a Southern university I sub
scribed to a course which I believe
the catalogue called "Constitutional
Law," which is neither here nor
there. Neither was the course. It was
taught by one of those striking old
Southern gentlemen one reads
about and sees in soft drink ads;
his hobby, along with the more de
lightful mint julep hobby, was a

| good old Southern avocation, to wit: >
i being, acting, living, talking Demo
cratic Party politics. For several
I weeks while nursing a broken arm |
|and unable to draw pictures, 1 idly;
! amused myself in class by listening ,
to the professor's lectures. They j
were all about how to be a Demo- '
! crat. Simply as a matter of habit, j
1 like preferring one particular brand
1 of cigaret, 1 had, up to this point, at
, tached myself to Democratic policies.
But! The gentleman in question ex-
I plained and supported the Demo
cratic theory so well, so vividly, so j
elucidatingly that in two months'
time I became a steadfast Repub
lican. Not that I know anything
about Republicanism, but that I do
know about Democraticism. It is
therefore that I present myself as
the one and only living, breathing,
talking college student whose politi
cal philosophy has been altered by
a professor's lectures.
Having gone thus far I feel I must
add a word in explanation lest my
position be misunderstood. My
change in position is purely one of
political THEORY and must not be
confused with political PRACTICE.
I therefore am not inconsistent when
I vote for Roosevelt since, although
the theories of the parties may vary
widely, the practices are apparently
identical, insofar as their effects
upon the people are concerned at
any rate. In other words, one may
prefer Lucky Strike advertising to
Camel advertising, but their "igar
ets taste the same.
Besides, I get more fun out of
voting Democratic. And that .ma
soning, sister Sue, has as few f'nws
in it as that which guides the vdlp
of the average public spirited Jupe
whose misguided sense of duty »;alls
him to the polls.

William A. J. Bowen Clr.
The Editor, Sir:
With busting pride, untempered
I and unrestrained by a decent sense
of modesty, I beg to burst forth in
this column (or must you insist on
"colyum") to nominate myself as
the "on? and only" for whom Dippy's
able MellinkofT has sought in vain.
Here's how: In a recent session of
"'Bull Session" Mr. MellinkofT in
discussing Democrats and Repub
licans and other such national bull
| topics, lamented that, "I have yet to
! find tho rollpgp student who has had
j a traditional parly allegiance
I changed by his college education."
j But here is my story:
In a Southern university I sub
scribed to a course which I believe
the catalogue called "Constitutional
Law," which is neither here nor
there. Neither was the course. It was
taught by one of those striking old
Southern gentlemen one reads
about and sees in soft drink ads;
his hobby, along with the more de
lightful mint julep hobby, was a

| good old Southern avocation, to wit: >
i being, acting, living, talking Demo
cratic Party politics. For several
I weeks while nursing a broken arm |
|and unable to draw pictures, 1 idly;
! amused myself in class by listening ,
to the professor's lectures. They j
were all about how to be a Demo- '
! crat. Simply as a matter of habit, j
1 like preferring one particular brand
1 of cigaret, 1 had, up to this point, at
, tached myself to Democratic policies.
But! The gentleman in question ex-
I plained and supported the Demo
cratic theory so well, so vividly, so j
elucidatingly that in two months'
time I became a steadfast Repub
lican. Not that I know anything
about Republicanism, but that I do
know about Democraticism. It is
therefore that I present myself as
the one and only living, breathing,
talking college student whose politi
cal philosophy has been altered by
a professor's lectures.
Having gone thus far I feel I must
add a word in explanation lest my
position be misunderstood. My
change in position is purely one of
political THEORY and must not be
confused with political PRACTICE.
I therefore am not inconsistent when
I vote for Roosevelt since, although
the theories of the parties may vary
widely, the practices are apparently
identical, insofar as their effects
upon the people are concerned at
any rate. In other words, one may
prefer Lucky Strike advertising to
Camel advertising, but their "igar
ets taste the same.
Besides, I get more fun out of
voting Democratic. And that .ma
soning, sister Sue, has as few f'nws
in it as that which guides the vdlp
of the average public spirited Jupe
whose misguided sense of duty »;alls
him to the polls.
