NOTES SEEN ON a disgusted
man's cuff last Saturday:
Debts this week-end—slo to Joe
for a d d fool bet on St. Mary's.
$5 to Mike. Glad I didn't give him
odds on Washington. $2.50 to Oscar.
Guess the odds on U.S.C. were jus
tified. Well, there was my only
cinch to cash in, and I let my
warped ideas run away with com
mon sense. But those other two —
oh-h-h, NUTS! Well, I hope I can
find some sucker that wants to bet
on the Cal. Aggies. If he calls my
bet, I'll probably chicken out.
THERE MAS MORE football
(from the spectator's viewpoint)
in Saturday's Washington-Stan
ford game than in any other
seen here lor several years. And
the crowd was one of the small
est. Long runs, spectacular
passes, and good weather —all
for $2.20, folks. That was one a
lot of people missed—students
included.
DID YOU NOTICE the difference
in the Stanford rooting section
when the Cards began to light back
in the closing minutes against the
Huskies?
It wasn't the rooters that made
the players fight. But it WAS the
players' fight that made the rooters
yell. Lethargy is one thing the
Farm fans should shake. Their last
chance to show what they can do
comes in the Big Game, November
19, at Berkeley. Let's hope there
won't be too many public speaking
examinations (lie day before the
game.
♦ <f
JUST IN THE V/AY of a re
minder to the Stanford frosh foot
ball team—you're plenty good, but
remember it lakes lots of football
to win any game. Don't forget, in
ihe seasons to come, what happened
to you last week-end.
SECOND THOUGHTS . . .
Public seat sales of I»ig Game
tickets and Koshered pigskins
are equally rare . . . but 1000
ducats were available here Sat
urday before the varsity game
... it would appear that what
ever chances Stanford might
have of getting a bid to the
Pasadena Tournament of Roses
game January 1 are quite thor
oughly exploded . . • authentic
rumors from the South say that
a few alumni arc tired ol How
ard Jones . . . Norman Thomas'
campaign work must have been
VERY effective . . . IIEIi! HEII!
HEH! . . . can you imagine a
Tvojair idumnus wanting to sec
Stanford "h'feat U.S.C.? . . .
LATEST REPORTS from the hos
pital say that Johnny Dope, who
was slugged in the giblets over the
week-end, may be able to be on
hand next Saturday. John took 'em
from the East, South, and West this
time. Pretty game old boy, at that.
That's the trouble with him, he's
too game.
LOOKING AHEAD four or five
months-*—
We may see Big Ben Eastman,
Stanford's quarter-mile star, going
in the mile run. Sports writers have
predicted that Ben would break 4:15
the first time he runs the race.
At present, Bangs has been run
ning sprints in the Friday meets.
He covered the 100 in :10.5 and the
220 in 22 flat this last week. Good
enough for pre-winter workouts.
Bill Miller, who won the
Olympic Games pole-vaulting
title, Nellie Gray, who garnered
a point for Uncle Sam in the
shot, and Eastman are already
at it for next season. They
started out about this time last
year, went through autumn and
winter practices before having
meets in the spring, continued
through the 1.C.4-A. and the
final American Olympic Try outs,
and went in the Olympiadc. Now
they're hack again after a com
parative short holiday. Miller's
was particularly short, since he
toured the country with an ex
hibition team after the Los An
geles show.
Henri (Here) Laborde, an
other Stanford point-winner in
the Olympics, is holding down
a regular berth on the football
team. Oh, you already knew
that, didn't you? —B.L.

LATEST REPORTS from the hos
pital say that Johnny Dope, who
was slugged in the giblets over the
week-end, may be able to be on
hand next Saturday. John took 'em
from the East, South, and West this
time. Pretty game old boy, at that.
That's the trouble with him, he's
too game.
LOOKING AHEAD four or five
months-*—
We may see Big Ben Eastman,
Stanford's quarter-mile star, going
in the mile run. Sports writers have
predicted that Ben would break 4:15
the first time he runs the race.
At present, Bangs has been run
ning sprints in the Friday meets.
He covered the 100 in :10.5 and the
220 in 22 flat this last week. Good
enough for pre-winter workouts.
Bill Miller, who won the
Olympic Games pole-vaulting
title, Nellie Gray, who garnered
a point for Uncle Sam in the
shot, and Eastman are already
at it for next season. They
started out about this time last
year, went through autumn and
winter practices before having
meets in the spring, continued
through the 1.C.4-A. and the
final American Olympic Try outs,
and went in the Olympiadc. Now
they're hack again after a com
parative short holiday. Miller's
was particularly short, since he
toured the country with an ex
hibition team after the Los An
geles show.
Henri (Here) Laborde, an
other Stanford point-winner in
the Olympics, is holding down
a regular berth on the football
team. Oh, you already knew
that, didn't you? —B.L.
NOTES SEEN ON a disgusted
man's cuff last Saturday:
Debts this week-end—slo to Joe
for a d d fool bet on St. Mary's.
$5 to Mike. Glad I didn't give him
odds on Washington. $2.50 to Oscar.
Guess the odds on U.S.C. were jus
tified. Well, there was my only
cinch to cash in, and I let my
warped ideas run away with com
mon sense. But those other two —
oh-h-h, NUTS! Well, I hope I can
find some sucker that wants to bet
on the Cal. Aggies. If he calls my
bet, I'll probably chicken out.
THERE MAS MORE football
(from the spectator's viewpoint)
in Saturday's Washington-Stan
ford game than in any other
seen here lor several years. And
the crowd was one of the small
est. Long runs, spectacular
passes, and good weather —all
for $2.20, folks. That was one a
lot of people missed—students
included.
DID YOU NOTICE the difference
in the Stanford rooting section
when the Cards began to light back

was slugged in the giblets over the
week-end, may be able to be on
hand next Saturday. John took 'em
from the East, South, and West this
time. Pretty game old boy, at that.
That's the trouble with him, he's
too game.
LOOKING AHEAD four or five
months-*—
We may see Big Ben Eastman,
Stanford's quarter-mile star, going
in the mile run. Sports writers have
predicted that Ben would break 4:15
the first time he runs the race.
At present, Bangs has been run
ning sprints in the Friday meets.
He covered the 100 in :10.5 and the
220 in 22 flat this last week. Good
enough for pre-winter workouts.
Bill Miller, who won the
Olympic Games pole-vaulting
title, Nellie Gray, who garnered
a point for Uncle Sam in the
shot, and Eastman are already
at it for next season. They
started out about this time last
year, went through autumn and
winter practices before having
meets in the spring, continued
through the 1.C.4-A. and the
final American Olympic Try outs,
and went in the Olympiadc. Now
they're hack again after a com
parative short holiday. Miller's
was particularly short, since he
toured the country with an ex
hibition team after the Los An
geles show.
Henri (Here) Laborde, an
other Stanford point-winner in
the Olympics, is holding down
a regular berth on the football
team. Oh, you already knew
that, didn't you? —B.L.
NOTES SEEN ON a disgusted
man's cuff last Saturday:
Debts this week-end—slo to Joe
for a d d fool bet on St. Mary's.
$5 to Mike. Glad I didn't give him
odds on Washington. $2.50 to Oscar.
Guess the odds on U.S.C. were jus
tified. Well, there was my only
cinch to cash in, and I let my
warped ideas run away with com
mon sense. But those other two —
oh-h-h, NUTS! Well, I hope I can
find some sucker that wants to bet
on the Cal. Aggies. If he calls my
bet, I'll probably chicken out.
THERE MAS MORE football
(from the spectator's viewpoint)
in Saturday's Washington-Stan
ford game than in any other
seen here lor several years. And
the crowd was one of the small
est. Long runs, spectacular
passes, and good weather —all
for $2.20, folks. That was one a
lot of people missed—students
included.
DID YOU NOTICE the difference
in the Stanford rooting section
when the Cards began to light back
in the closing minutes against the
Huskies?
It wasn't the rooters that made
the players fight. But it WAS the
players' fight that made the rooters
yell. Lethargy is one thing the
Farm fans should shake. Their last
chance to show what they can do
comes in the Big Game, November
19, at Berkeley. Let's hope there
won't be too many public speaking
examinations (lie day before the
game.

JUST IN THE V/AY of a re
minder to the Stanford frosh foot
ball team—you're plenty good, but
remember it lakes lots of football
to win any game. Don't forget, in
ihe seasons to come, what happened
to you last week-end.
SECOND THOUGHTS . . .
Public seat sales of I»ig Game
tickets and Koshered pigskins
are equally rare . . . but 1000
ducats were available here Sat
urday before the varsity game
... it would appear that what
ever chances Stanford might
have of getting a bid to the
Pasadena Tournament of Roses
game January 1 are quite thor
oughly exploded . . • authentic
rumors from the South say that
a few alumni arc tired ol How
ard Jones . . . Norman Thomas'
campaign work must have been
VERY effective . . . IIEIi! HEII!
HEH! . . . can you imagine a
Tvojair idumnus wanting to sec
Stanford "h'feat U.S.C.? . . .
