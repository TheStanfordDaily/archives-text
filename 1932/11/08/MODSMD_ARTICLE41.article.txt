# Maentz Returns; Grays Hold Reserves To Tie
## HALFBACK NAMED CARDINAL CAPTAIN FOR CALAG GAME Returns To Lineup After Being Injured In Game Against O.S.C. 
### 
A mixed group of second and third
string varsity players were held to
a scoreless tie by the Stanford Grays
in a practice game last night that
lasted until long after darkness had
lallen.
The Grays showed a strong of
fensive during the first half of the
game and drove to the varsity 11-
yard line on one occasion. At this
point an incomplete pass ended their
threat.
Towards the end of the game the
band of outweighed Gray linemen
began to relax under the heavy
pounding of Chuck White, right
halfback, and the running of Bob
Maentz, who played in his first
scrimmage since injured in the Ore
gon State game. On the last play
of the contest, Ed Walker broke
away for a long run around Nor
wood, the Gray's left end, and was
not stopped until he had reached
the 5-yard line.
Muller Stands Out
While he was in the game, Walt
Muller, the giant Gray lineman from
Glendale J.C. who voluntarily chose
to play a year on the reserve eleven,
was the outstanding player on the
field, but interest centered on the
speed and drive shown by the var
sity's triple-threat halfback, Bob
Maentz. Maentz did not favor his
injury at any time during the scrim
mage, and he will undoubtedly make
a great battle to earn back the first
string left halfback post which Bill
Sun and Kenny Afflerbaugh are
now fighting over.
The Varsity's starting lineup was
Blanchard, center; Tarver and
O'Conner, guards; Chuck Rogers and
Prelsnik, tackles; Ransom and
Thorny Rogers, ends; Walker, quar
terback; White and Maentz, half
backs; Stevens, fullback.
Blanchard turned in his usual
brilliant defensive game at center,
and looking far better on offensive
play than he has for some time.
Most of the Gray yardage was made
over Chuck Prelsnik at left tackle.
Regulars Get Rest
Pop Warner has chosen Bob Ma
entz as captain for next Saturday's
contest with the California Aggies,
in which no first string players will
be used. The players who had to
go through three hard battles in
three week-ends against U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Washington will get
a good rest in preparation for what
they intend to be a real comeback
against California in the Big Game,
November 19.

band of outweighed Gray linemen
began to relax under the heavy
pounding of Chuck White, right
halfback, and the running of Bob
Maentz, who played in his first
scrimmage since injured in the Ore
gon State game. On the last play
of the contest, Ed Walker broke
away for a long run around Nor
wood, the Gray's left end, and was
not stopped until he had reached
the 5-yard line.
Muller Stands Out
While he was in the game, Walt
Muller, the giant Gray lineman from
Glendale J.C. who voluntarily chose
to play a year on the reserve eleven,
was the outstanding player on the
field, but interest centered on the
speed and drive shown by the var
sity's triple-threat halfback, Bob
Maentz. Maentz did not favor his
injury at any time during the scrim
mage, and he will undoubtedly make
a great battle to earn back the first
string left halfback post which Bill
Sun and Kenny Afflerbaugh are
now fighting over.
The Varsity's starting lineup was
Blanchard, center; Tarver and
O'Conner, guards; Chuck Rogers and
Prelsnik, tackles; Ransom and
Thorny Rogers, ends; Walker, quar
terback; White and Maentz, half
backs; Stevens, fullback.
Blanchard turned in his usual
brilliant defensive game at center,
and looking far better on offensive
play than he has for some time.
Most of the Gray yardage was made
over Chuck Prelsnik at left tackle.
Regulars Get Rest
Pop Warner has chosen Bob Ma
entz as captain for next Saturday's
contest with the California Aggies,
in which no first string players will
be used. The players who had to
go through three hard battles in
three week-ends against U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Washington will get
a good rest in preparation for what
they intend to be a real comeback
against California in the Big Game,
November 19.
A mixed group of second and third
string varsity players were held to
a scoreless tie by the Stanford Grays
in a practice game last night that
lasted until long after darkness had
lallen.
The Grays showed a strong of
fensive during the first half of the
game and drove to the varsity 11-
yard line on one occasion. At this
point an incomplete pass ended their
threat.
Towards the end of the game the
band of outweighed Gray linemen
began to relax under the heavy
pounding of Chuck White, right
halfback, and the running of Bob
Maentz, who played in his first
scrimmage since injured in the Ore
gon State game. On the last play
