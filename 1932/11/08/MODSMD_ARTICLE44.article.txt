# Gray Players Improve Fast
## Men Ready For Bear Tilt Saturday At Berkeley 
### 
A fast-improving Gray squad j
served notice last night that the'
California Goofs will be in for a j
j busy session Saturday when the j
I two teams clash over at Berkeley I
| in their annual game.
Slightly changed from last week's |
' first-string lineup, yesterday's start- j
j ing team consisted of Smith and j
: Steiner at ends; Keller and Buller, i
| tackles; Black and Cook, guards;
Muller, center; Strong, quarter; Ab- \
bot and Zaches, halves; and Seaver j
at full.
Abbot, one of the lightest men on j
! the squad, has been steadily ad- j
j vancing all season and more than '
: proved his ability last night, espe- j
! cially as a blocker. Zaches got off .
! some speedy runs that enabled the '
I Grays to advance the ball deep into i
j the varsity territory. Seaver excelled j
as usual in a triple-threat role,
i Bates followed up Muller's good i
| work at center and showed that his !
j brother is not the only member of .
; the family that likes to roam in the !
j enemy backfield. Drown replaced
j Keller at tackle and turned in a
I strong defensive game.
Sales of 5- end 10-cent package
candy amounted to more than 53 j
million pounds last year, represent- â– 
i ing a slight gain.
