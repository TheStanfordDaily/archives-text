Disrupting a comparatively calm
series of intramural touch football
games yesterday afternoon, El Toro
grid men whitewashed the squad
lrom Theta Delta Chi with a 39 to 0
victory. The Phi Psi's downed the
men from Sigma Alpha Epsilon 13-0,
the Phi Kaps defeated Theta Xi 13
to 0, and the Sequoia I squad drub
bed the Los Aicos team in an 18-0
win.
Toro in the game with the Theta
Delts found the first half more diffi
cult as far as scoring was concerned
than the second half. With Gene
Mires leading the Toro attack and
accounting for 18 of his team's
points, the clubmen easily bowled
over the Theta Dolt defense. Hun
ley, Toro end, tallied two touch
downs, while F'shei and Mores
made the others. %
With the men from SA.E. bat
tling behind a comparatively strong
defence, the Phi Psi's failed to put
on any flashy attacks as has been
their custom. Ike Hables was in
there as usual when the time came
to score, although George Latimer
made the two touchdowns. Triplett
and Budge displayed a good brand
of ball during the game.
All the scoring business in the
Phi Kap-Theta Xi game was con
ducted in the first half. Walters of
the Phi Kaps intercepted a pass and
ran 50 yards to a touchdown.
Wood worth on a pass from Irsfeld
tallied the other six points. Hall and
Nichols claimed honors in the Theta
Xi outfit.
