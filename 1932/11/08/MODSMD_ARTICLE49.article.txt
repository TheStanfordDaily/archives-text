# MALONEY'S SOCCER TEAM SET FOR DONS TOMORROW
## 
### 
With the all-important game |
1 against the championship-bound t
! San Francisco University soccer j
! eleven set for "tomorrow afternoon j
: in the big city, Coach Hany Ma- j
loney will today put finishing j
. touches on the rejuvenated Stan-
I ford squad.
When the California varsity failed
to put in an appearance for its
scheduled game with the Indians
last Friday, Maloney scrimmaged
| his first team against the substi
tutes with most satisfactory results. ;
Last night he scrimmaged the '
j same two teams and had a similarly I
j pleasing showing. The first squad, ,
j operating without Art Hearn at
j center forward and using A1 Vel- :
| arde instead, managed to score two I
! goals on the seconds.
| The new scoring combination of '
| Carl Knecht at inside left, Hearn, j
j center forward, and Cy Johnson,

| inside right, seems (o be a potent
| one, particularly with the excellent
flank work of Wataro Sutow, left
wing, and Laurie Washburn, right
wing. This quintet accounted for
j four scores in last Friday's scrim
mage, Knecht driving in two, Sutow
and Hearn one apiece.
Halfbacks White, Kennedy, and
Spohr, and fullbacks Brekelbaum,
Branch, and Krumbein have been
providing the sort of defense that
makes a goalie's life an easy one,
| and as a result, Jack King has only
| had to stop a few attempts made by
I the second string forward wall.
J After the first two squads wound
j up their scrimmage yesterday, Bus
ter Holmes sent his frosh in against
the third-string varsity. The frosh
carried most of the play, scored
j once when Frier connected on a
corner kick, but finished in a dead
lock with the varsity when for
wards Krebs, Hearn, and Bapf
pushed, blocked, and kicked the ball
past goalie Laird in a skirmish in
front of the goal.
