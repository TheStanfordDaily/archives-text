# GENETICS TALK GIVEN TONIGHT
## Dr. Goldschmidt To Speak On Heredity Theory 
### 
"The Physiological Theory of j
I Heredity" is the l lecture topic of Dr. J
Richard Goldschmidt, authority on i
genetics, who speaks tonight in the j
Little Theatie. In order that this ;
' Tuesday Evening Lecture will not
interfere with those planning to
j listen to the election returns, the
' time has been set up to 7:15 o'clock.
Goldschmidt, who comes to Stan
j ford after having visited the Univer
j sity of California, will also be the
guest-lecturer at the Jordan Sem- ,
inar at 4 o'clock this afternoon in |
| room 430.
Sent to America as the German i
! representative to the Sixth Interna
i tional Genetics Congress held in
! Ithaca, New York, last August, the
{ professor is noted for his experi- j
j ments wit hthe gypsy moth. He has
] collected these moths in all parts i
j of the world.
The bulk of Goldschmidt's experi
j ments in heredity have been carried
on at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute I
j of Biology, where he is director and
| professor. Dr. Goldschmidt has spe
j cialized on the physiology of hered
l >ty, rather than sociological effects.
"Heredity and the Determination
j of Sex," "Introduction to Heredity,"
j and "The Physiological Theory of j
Heredity" are but a few of Gold- j
i schmidt's writings. He is a steady j
j contributor to a number of scien- j
! tific periodicals.
i Goldschmidt will be entertained j
!at dinner by Dr. Danforth of the
j biology department. '
