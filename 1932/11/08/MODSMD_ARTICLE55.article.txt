# Bailey Predicts Win For Bourbon Party

I able ir «>ttest Ho-ver has unuoubt
j edly i.,.proved his position in the
i last three weeks, but whether it
; has been enough to take up the
i slack remains to be seen.
"But win, lose, or draw, he must
;be given credit for having, almost
| single-handed, put up a magnificent
: fight."
Bailey quoted T. B. Reed, who
I said, "We have a two party system,
I one party watching—one party gov
j erning." And it is Bailey's sincere
! conviction that the "present Demo
| cratie leaders are better at watch
ing-"
"It is a far cry from Democrat
G rover Cleveland to Democrat
: Franklin Roosevelt. The campaign
j slogan of Cleveland's followers was:
I 'We love him most of all for the
; enemies he has made.' Roosevelt
has not made enough of the right
I kind of enemies."
The professor stated that "the Re
publican Party is historically the
! party of big business." "Relief," he
j stated, "must come from the top. It
is ridiculous to attempt to 'give a
I sick man medicine under the finger
; nails.' The major organs of the na
! tion must be fed first. Prosperity
j trickles downward. When business
| prospers, the 'forgotten man' pros-
I pers."
I The significant political dope
j sheets prepared by Bailey follow:

Today as 47,000,000 followers of |
the Democratic Donkey and the j
Republican Pachyderm put an end ■
to political ballyhoo and bickering, j
Assistant Professor of History Thom
as Andrew Bailey casts his vote for j
President Hoover and at the same |
time points out that the test polls j
and the facts of history indicate the j
election of Governor Roosevelt.
Examining the unbiased prece- |
dents of American politics, Bailey !
has discovered (1) That no party has j
ever weathered the storm of a major |
mancial panic; (2) That since 1874 j
the party in power has been turned |
out in the elections following a j
mid-term shift to the opposite party; ;
and (3) That the passage of all ma- :
jor tariff bills since the Civil War |
has resulted in the defeat of the i
incumbent party.
The only exceptions to the first 1
two findings are in the case of the !
Hayes-Tilden election of 1876 when j
the latter received the popular plur- j
j ality, while Hayes was given the j
election. In the case of the tariff, j
the general statement has been true j
I except when wars have intervened i
I and except in the case of the 1922 ;
| protective tariff.
While Bailey believes that "the j
1 odds are against Hoover," he said,
, "The Republicans have a faculty j
for putting up a terrific fight at the i
j end, as the Democrats in 1896 were ]

as Andrew Bailey casts his vote for j
President Hoover and at the same |
time points out that the test polls j
and the facts of history indicate the j
election of Governor Roosevelt.
Examining the unbiased prece- |
dents of American politics, Bailey !
has discovered (1) That no party has j
ever weathered the storm of a major |
mancial panic; (2) That since 1874 j
the party in power has been turned |
out in the elections following a j
mid-term shift to the opposite party; ;
and (3) That the passage of all ma- :
jor tariff bills since the Civil War |
has resulted in the defeat of the i
incumbent party.
The only exceptions to the first 1
two findings are in the case of the !
Hayes-Tilden election of 1876 when j
the latter received the popular plur- j
j ality, while Hayes was given the j
election. In the case of the tariff, j
the general statement has been true j
I except when wars have intervened i
I and except in the case of the 1922 ;
| protective tariff.
While Bailey believes that "the j
1 odds are against Hoover," he said,
