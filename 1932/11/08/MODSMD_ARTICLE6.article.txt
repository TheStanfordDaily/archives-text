of Law will begin their annual
lounds again tonight when the first
moot court case is argued by cub

men of the law school, before Judge
Lowell Turrentine, professor of the
law faculty.
The initial case at bar involves
the leasing of a piece of property,

has grounds for equitable fore
closure or merely sue for damages
in the ordinary way.
The question was given out two

weeks ago and briefs were in last
on the basis of preparation of the
briefs, presentation of arguments,
and ability to answer questions of
the court.
