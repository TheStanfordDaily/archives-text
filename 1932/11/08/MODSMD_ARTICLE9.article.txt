# State Rum Act Vote Discussed By Professors
## 
### 
! Although a national presidential
| election overshadows the importance
| of a state-wide vote on the prohibi- !
| tion question, California voters today !
| will have a chance <o regster their i
j convictions in regard to state en- !
! forcement of the national prohibi
| tion amendment.
Upholds Wright Act
j Expressing his opinion in regard J
to measures Nos. 1 and 2 on the .
state ballot, Arthur M. Cathcart, i
professor of law, stated that even if !
he were not a "dry," he would op-
I pose the California initiative propo- 1
I sitions. "Out of loyalty to the Con- j
' stitution of the United States, I
i would like to see the California
statutes enforce the Eighteenth
Amendment as a part of the funda
j mental national laws.
"In regard to the second measure,
' it would defeat local option, a prin- i
, eiple which is of prime importance J
to our concept of local government. |
Barclay Opposes Cathcart I
I Presenting opposing views, |
; Thomas S. Barclay, political science i
j professor, stated: "Contrary to the ;
| general impression, the states are |
j under no obligation, either legal or :
I moral, to enforce the Eighteenth '
j Amendment. Americans are not ac- j
I customed to a form of government
j which places upon the states the
duty of carrying out the powers of ;
| the national government. California
should follow the example set by i
Maryland, New York, and six other
states in repealing state enforcement,
the Wright Act. Let the national
government assume full authority in
this matter as it does in national
taxation, foreign relations, and the
like."
Agreeing with Cathcart on the sec- i
ond propostion, Barclay continued, j
"In a state so diversified as Califor
nia, it seems best to re-establish lo
cal option as the most feasible man- j
ner in dealing with the regulation
of the liquor traffic. For that rea
son, many will oppose the passage of
constitutional amendment No. 2, !
which seems to compel the adoption
of one plan for the entire state." j
