A PRICELESS GIFT
FOR YOU
Sometimes an extra few minutes seem as an
hour, particularly when there is someone ill or
in pain. We have all had that experience at
times. At such times "service" is a "priceless
gift." How many times have you been willing
to pay most anything if "he would only hurry
with the medicine"—or perhaps it was only a
package of razor blades or a box of face
powder.
Our special delivery service has eliminated the
necessity of that worry and anxiety. It is a
priceless gift to you. We appreciate your order
whether large or small.
