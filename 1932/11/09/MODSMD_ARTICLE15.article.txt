I congratulate you on the
opportunity that has come to
you to be of service to the
country and I wish for you a
most successful administra

of all of us I shall dedicate
myself to every possible help
ful effort.
Herbert Hoover

In this manner did Herbert Hoover
| gallantly concede the loss of the
! Presidency of the United States to
: Franklin Delano Roos'evelt by the
j probably greatest margin of electoral
j votes in history.
j November 9 (A 3 )— A gigantic tide
j of voters rolling westward with un
i diminishing force has swept Demo
cratic f orces behind Franklin D.
Rooseveiv into control of national
and many state offices.
In the Republican count for Presi
dent Hoover, only six states weie
definitely aligned in what promises
to be a record popular vote poured
in early today from the last Eastern
districts and the West. The Hoover
states were Delaware, Maine, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsyl
vania, and Vermont.
With more lhan 14,000,000 votes
counted in one-third of the nation's
collection districts, Democratic
forces held a plurality near the
3,OGv n OO mark, for an electoral vote
already over 400 out of a possible
531.
j If popular balloting maintains this
pace in the remaining districts, the
aggregate vote promises to exceed
1928's record of 37.000,000 by five
million.
G.O.P. States Shift
Indications of Democratic strength
were Democratic pluralities in such
normally Republican states as Mich
igan, Indiana, Ohio, lowa, Kansas,
i and Utah, and mounting margins of
i victory on the West Coast which ap
j parently were engulfing President
j Hoover's own state of California.
With the national ticket, a Demo
| cratic Senate and House seemed as
[ sured together with victories for the
i party in a majority of 35 guberna
torial contests. Accompanying these
| shifts were evidences of anti-Pro-
I hibition sentiment in many districts.
James E. Watson, Republican Sen
ate leader, and Senator Reed Smoot
of Utah conceded defeat.

j November 9 (A 3 )— A gigantic tide
j of voters rolling westward with un
i diminishing force has swept Demo
cratic f orces behind Franklin D.
Rooseveiv into control of national
and many state offices.
In the Republican count for Presi
dent Hoover, only six states weie
definitely aligned in what promises
to be a record popular vote poured
in early today from the last Eastern
districts and the West. The Hoover
states were Delaware, Maine, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsyl
vania, and Vermont.
With more lhan 14,000,000 votes
counted in one-third of the nation's
collection districts, Democratic
forces held a plurality near the
3,OGv n OO mark, for an electoral vote
already over 400 out of a possible
531.
j If popular balloting maintains this
pace in the remaining districts, the
aggregate vote promises to exceed
1928's record of 37.000,000 by five
million.
