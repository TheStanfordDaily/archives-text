# TO THE VICTOR

### 
Well, Roosevelt and I lie hoys j> u ( il over. Not thai il
whs «i surprise for a Democratic, victory was more or less
assured early in the year, when the depression, the bonus j
marches, and a combination of other unfortunate cireum-j
stances had caused the Republican administration to lose!
favor with that ever-present and important body, the j
American electorate.
And now the Democratic donkey, braying for a drink
at least light wines or beer will replace the peanut
munching (i.O.P. elephant as the trampler of the White!
House lawn. The American people went to the polls yes-1
terday and did just what the newspapers said they'd do, |
thereby clearing the air lanes for enjoyable radio enter-j
lainment.
Toda\ all the glory and credit which may accrue to a
political figure belong to Roosevelt, for he emerged vic
torious from a strenuous campaign against a worthy op
ponent, Herbert Hoover. C.hoscn as the fittest leader for!
the Democratic parly on the basis of his record as governor j
of New York, Franklin I). Roosevelt succeeded in convinc
ing a majority of voters that he is a man capable of dis-'
patching the duties of the presidency. His conduct through-,
out the campaign won him the confidence of the electorate,
;• confidence which will aid him in his herculean task of
reconstruction.
Roosevelt was unusually luckv to win the presidency at
this particular hour in history. The inevitable lip-swing
which will surely follow the economic depression at some'
time during his term, will mark him as one of the greatest
of tinted Slates presidents.
