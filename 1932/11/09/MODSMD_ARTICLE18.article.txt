# AFTER ALL-!

### 
Al Insl I lie annovingly smooth surface of the 19.T2 |
spirit of "friendly rivalry" between California's univcrsi-i
ties has been ruffled. The Trojan editor, the very same man |
who devoted almost his entire column to a eulogy of Stan-j
ford sportsmanship after the annual I'.S.C. Hogging, this |
week threw the hooks into California for what he termed
"as bad an example of poor sportsmanship" as the coast |
has ever seen.
After Hit 1 Trov-Bear encounter down south, a consider-!
able number of California rooters left the Blue and Cold
section immediately after the final gun popped. "Con
siderable niini!n r" is used advisedly, since California I
claims il was only a few, while the Trojans hold that the !
section departed "en masse" before their rooters could
cross the field for the post mortem ceremony.
Perhaps il is that the Daily is indignant at being left
out of the lirsl good editorial tangle of the year. At any i
rate, it is willing to project its proboscis a bit for the
genuine pleasure of commenting on what appears to be a
very tine scrap.
In the lirsl place, the action of Ihe Bear rooters flavors
more of common sense than of poor sportsmanship. If you
ask us, watching the Trojan horde gloal once is depressing!
enough. Witnessing its victory cavorting year after year I
becomes downright tiresome.
California had the courage to defy tradition to avoid
a humiliating experience. But now Ihe Be rkeleyans have
contracted cold feet, and instead of explaining why they
left, they are claiming that they did not leave.
And after all, Troy, cannot a poor bear that has already
taken enough punishment be allowed to put his tail be
tween his legs and run without having editorial rancor
heaped upon liiin from behind?
