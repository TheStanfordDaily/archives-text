# THOSE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
The shouting is all over, and the Little Big (lame has
been played. The class of .'Mi can look hack on one of the
most successful football seasons that any freshman team
has had in many years. Congratulations are in order for a
job well done.
Lurking just around the corner is a cloud ready to
dampen the high spirits of these precocious freshmen.
This omen of evil times is our "poor relation" old man
studies. The administration building lias a Strang habit
of ignoring all tin 1 other merits of a student if he fails to
get a sufficient number of grade points. "Down? Then
you're out!" is a cry that 100 often rings through the halls.
Because of football, the excuse may have been raised
that you were too busy to put enough time on the scholastic
side of the curriculum. With six weeks left before the end
01 the quarter, care should be taken that no other excuses
are brought forward which might prevent studying. All
the good intentions in the world won't help your college
career if you have been restrained from registering. It is
what you have done as a senior and what you promise as
freshman lhat makes university history.
