# BULL SESSION
## IT'S ALL OVER NOW! 
### 
Imagine the impossible task of
j writing on the national election
without having the returns. Imagine
i the still more impossible task of
writing on some subject other than
the all-time greatest dog and cat
fight in the history of the nation,
i Impaled on the two horns of the
< dilemma, the obvious solution is to
lop off both horns—throw the type-
I writer out the window—and whittle
I totem poles out of lead pencils.
We did that for two hours; but
finally having run out of pencils,
I we returned to the typewriter. This
morning the votes have been
j counted. One set of campaign man
| agers are biting their nails in utter
; chagrin; the other is acclaiming
I itself the greatest prognosticators of
| public sentiment yet to appear on
J the horizon. Both are wrong—nei
j ther ever knew who was going to
win. Both were screaming in the
| dark to convince people that their
| party was the band-wagon and not
; the political hearse.
The battle is over. The dust is
1 already beginning to settle into the
raw throats of party whoopers. And
i now that promises, platitudes, and
| piffle have been relegated to quick
! ly-forgotten history, the people
! have the right to ask, "Well, now
' what?" They won't, however. It is
I a good thing that ihey don't. The
{ fact that they never ask that ques
tion; and as a logical result, the fact
; that it is never answered makes
possible these great emotional cloud
i bursts every four years.

And when the deluge comes—and
i it always comes according to Con
| stitutional provision every four
j years —all reason is swept under,
i Old war-horses armed with old
! speeches gallop over the country
repeating old stories with about the
same results. The only difference is
; that sometimes one party wins and
j sometimes the other party wins. It
is reasonably certain at. this writing
—twelve hours before the votes will
have been counted—that one of
: these two conclusions will be real
; ized.
No matter what the result, some
i people will tremble. Some postmas
ters will tremble at the prospect of
| losing jobs and others will tremble
: with joy and excitement at the
prospect of getting those jobs. No
matter what the result, things will
1 be just about what they have been.
Some people are happy that such
is the after-election story. When
; both parties try 10 scoop up every
' available vote, it is only natural
that nothing can be done. Maybe it
is better that nothing is done. Maybe
there is nothing to do. There are a
few things upon which the parties
! disagree—just like in a horse-race
j the jockeys wear different colored
] jerseys and ride different colored
: horses. Sometimes the horses are
j the same color!
But it's a lot of fun—more ex
j citement than a "Big Game" even,
j But most students don't think so.
