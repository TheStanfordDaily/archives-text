STYLES IN ACTING (Dorothy
Sands). At the Community Play
house.
In a one-woman show called
| "Styles in Acting," Dorothy Sands
I presents a series of poignant cos-
I tume characterizations showing the
| principal styles of acting since the
j Commedia del' Arte. In an hour
' and three quarters she unfolds an
! amazing repertoire of impersona
j tions beginning with the Restora
j tion and ending with Mae West:
' 1932.
Her Millamant from Congreve's
of the World is a brilliant ex
hibition in which she captures and
completely portrays the social
veneer and sparkling dialogue of
the Resoration comedy of manners.
! Heroic Tragedy, the other import
ant form of this period, was repre
j sented by a characterization of
j Aimahide from Dryden's Conquest
I of Granada—delightfully over
-1 drawn and suggestive of tho general
use of legendary costume in this
i form.
Miss Sands's good work as Nellie
| Denver (The Silver King) afforded
i the quaintest costume of them all:
I "a wee little hat and a very large
j bustle." Her Candida started too
artificially for this realistic play but
( developed into something convinc-
I ing and fine.
As Anna Christie in the style of
( Pauline Lord, her work was an ac
| cumulated error. She reminded one
neither of Anna nor of Miss Lord,
j Imitation her metier, Miss Sands
i rose to satiric brilliance in her Lady
: Macbeth .sleepwalking scenes done
I in the styles of Haidee Wright, Ethel
Barrymore, and Mae West. The first,
| interesting, was hardly worthy of
| the acting of that grand old lady; in
J the second our so-called "first lady"
takes a sleighride—Miss Sands be
! ing jrdmost outdone by the handker
! chief she used to characterize one
• of the flagrant mannerisms of La
! Barrymore. As Mae West's Lady
| Macbeth she was insanely funny.
All in all a very pleasant after
! noon with Miss Sands acting per

haps more in her amusing prefatory
remark': of the different periods
1 than in her actual characterizations.'

■ SMOKE, October 1932. 48 Olive
Street, Providence, lihode Kland.
Of the little magazines of verse
that are so frequent these days,
i "Smoke" is one of the more inter
! esting. This issue contains an ex-
I cellent poem by Winfield Scott and
,a fairly good one by S. Foster
! Damon.
! We notice the magazine here,
! however, because it prints two
poems by Barbara Gibbs, a Stanford
junior. These poems appeared in
the English Club yearbook for 1931.
They are distinguished, and display
| an amazing mastery of free verse.
From a study of these fourteen
j lines the writers on the campus
could learn one of two things: how
to write free verse, or how difficult
i it is to write free verse, and, thus,
i how to leave it alone.
