## MORE MOONEY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Did the writer of yesterday's Daily
editorial on the Mooney frame-up
every study the facts of this Ameri
can Dreyfus case? Did he hear, with
15,000 other people gathered in San
Francisco last Sunday, the public 1
and sworn confession of Paul M.
Callicotte that he, not Mooney or!
Billings, was the unknowing perpe
trator of the Preparedness Day
bombing? Was he sufficiently intel- j
ligent to understand the a-b-c ex- !
planation of the crude frame-up, as'
it was told by Leo Gallagher, Lin
coln Steffens, Sam Darcy, Theodore j
Dreiser, and others who know the ;
facts?
If the answer to these questions
is "yes," how can this writer of the
perverted and superficial editorial
he wrote be capable of such non
sense?
It is unimaginable that anyone j

! could see comedy in the 16 years' i
imprisonment of a man whose only
"crime" was that of being a militant
! labor leader and union organizer, j
Yet the Daily attempts to laugh it
off. What the Daily fails to see is the j !
' fact that a world-wide fight is being ;
waged in deadly seriousness to free I
Mooney.
| As for Mooney being a "proved J
undesirable citizen," let it be said j'
; that his name will survive as a
i symbol of heroic working class
leadership long after all his framers ;
and jailors are dead and forgotten.
In closing, we, the undersigned,
ask the Daily to explain the editorial
stand it has taken on this case and
to answer fully, if it can, the ques
tions we ask above.
Sincerely,
W. R. Boyle
