Autumn leaves
From trees above
And memories
Of Summer's love—

Dr. Debye stated: "If one were to
stand on a balcony and watch a
ciowd in a ballroom after the dance,
he would first receive the impres
sion that all was confusion. But on
second examination he would dis
cover that by each woman was a

order existed."—Daily.
Only one man? But perhaps
the Doctor has never been to a
jolly-up.
