# Card Soccer Eleven Meets League Leading Dons Today
## STANFORD SQUAD IN TOP FORM FOR TILT WITH S. F. U. Maloney Hopes New Lineup Will Avenge Defeat In First Game 
### 
Meeting for the last time this sea- ;
son the undefeated team that seems |
to have the league championship j
well in hand, the Stanford Univer- j
sity soccer eleven faces S.F.U. tFiis i
afternoon in San Francisco on Ewing
Field.
After opening the year in rather
mediocre fashion with two victories
over the weak San Jose State team,
n tie and a defeat by San Mateo, and j
a defeat by S.F.U., the Stanford
squad seems to have apparently
reached the peak of its playing form
and hopes in today's skirmish to j
turn tin; tables on the Dons, who j
won in the first meeting of the sea- I
son, 4-I.'
Two Teams Practice
When California failed to show |
up for its scheduled game with the j
Indians last Friday, Coach Maloney j
let his first two teams engage each j
other in a practice game, and it was |
in this little "family battle" that the |
first signs of any really alert soccer j
were shown.
It may lie that the members of j
the team have finally decided to
wake up and play the kind of soc- j
cer of which they are capable. On I
the other hand, it may be the j
switch in line-up on the forward j
wall that has brought about this j
sudden turn for Ihe good; namely,
moving Carl Knecht from outside j
â€¢eft to inside left, and putting i
Wataru Sutow in Knecht's old J
place.
Squad Needs Pep
This leaves the balance of the
forward line with Washburn at out
side right, Johnson, inside right, and I
Hearn, center forward. Coach Ma- j
loney tried A1 Velarde in Art \
Hoarn's center position yesterday
afternoon, bub Velarde, who has j
been placing very clever ball with j
the second team for the past few 1
days, didn't handle the apple as well i
as he could.
As a matter of fact, the entire j
squad played rather shiftlessly yes- i
terday. Cy Johnson did manage to i
boot one through goalie King for 1
the varsity's only score of the of- !
ternoon, and Ward Krebs did the |
same thing for the substitutes, send- j
ing the ball through Milt Newman.
The ability of the halves and full- |
backs to constantly feed the for- :
wards has been one of the con- j
Iributing factors to the team's re- j
juvenation. It is they, also, who :
carry the burden of protecting the
goal.
Substitutes Taken
Waddy White is playing at left j
half, Doug Kennedy at center half,
and Alex Spoehr, right half. Mcl
Nicoll and Dave Dunning will be
taken on the trip to back up this
trio.
Captain Erwin Brekelbaum and
Nil' Branch will start at fullback, j
wilh Jack King in the goal. Bill j
Krumbein i>; nur r in<| an injured leg
and will not be able to play, but j
Kelly Steele will be kept in re- j
serve. Milt. Newman will be King's ,
alternate in the goal.
The team and its managers leave j
on a special bus this afternoon at;
1:15 o'clock.

Substitutes Taken
Waddy White is playing at left j
half, Doug Kennedy at center half,
and Alex Spoehr, right half. Mcl
Nicoll and Dave Dunning will be
taken on the trip to back up this
trio.
Captain Erwin Brekelbaum and
Nil' Branch will start at fullback, j
wilh Jack King in the goal. Bill j
Krumbein i>; nur r in<| an injured leg
and will not be able to play, but j
Kelly Steele will be kept in re- j
serve. Milt. Newman will be King's ,
alternate in the goal.
The team and its managers leave j
on a special bus this afternoon at;
1:15 o'clock.
Meeting for the last time this sea- ;
son the undefeated team that seems |
to have the league championship j
well in hand, the Stanford Univer- j
sity soccer eleven faces S.F.U. tFiis i
afternoon in San Francisco on Ewing
Field.
After opening the year in rather
mediocre fashion with two victories
over the weak San Jose State team,
n tie and a defeat by San Mateo, and j
a defeat by S.F.U., the Stanford
squad seems to have apparently
reached the peak of its playing form
and hopes in today's skirmish to j
turn tin; tables on the Dons, who j
won in the first meeting of the sea- I
son, 4-I.'
Two Teams Practice
When California failed to show |
up for its scheduled game with the j
Indians last Friday, Coach Maloney j
let his first two teams engage each j
other in a practice game, and it was |
in this little "family battle" that the |
first signs of any really alert soccer j
were shown.
It may lie that the members of j
the team have finally decided to
wake up and play the kind of soc- j
cer of which they are capable. On I
the other hand, it may be the j
switch in line-up on the forward j
wall that has brought about this j
sudden turn for Ihe good; namely,
moving Carl Knecht from outside j
â€¢eft to inside left, and putting i
Wataru Sutow in Knecht's old J
place.
Squad Needs Pep
This leaves the balance of the
forward line with Washburn at out
side right, Johnson, inside right, and I
Hearn, center forward. Coach Ma- j
loney tried A1 Velarde in Art \
Hoarn's center position yesterday
afternoon, bub Velarde, who has j
been placing very clever ball with j
the second team for the past few 1
days, didn't handle the apple as well i
as he could.
As a matter of fact, the entire j
squad played rather shiftlessly yes- i
terday. Cy Johnson did manage to i
boot one through goalie King for 1
the varsity's only score of the of- !
ternoon, and Ward Krebs did the |
same thing for the substitutes, send- j
ing the ball through Milt Newman.
The ability of the halves and full- |
backs to constantly feed the for- :
wards has been one of the con- j
Iributing factors to the team's re- j
juvenation. It is they, also, who :
carry the burden of protecting the
