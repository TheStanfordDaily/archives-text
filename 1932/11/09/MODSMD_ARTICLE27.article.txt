HAVING IlAI) ITS MUR
DEROUS tliree games put he
hind it, with all of them worth
forgetting, Stanford's varsity
football team is resting from
shocks yet to "ome,
For the fourth week in a row,
Stanford will be the favored eleven
when the initial whistle blows in
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon. But this time it will take a
real demonstration of the gods to
give the underdog a victory.
The Indians are not very inter
ested in what the California Aggies
have to offer, but they are interested
in what Idaho can offer California,
what California can do with what
Stanford will have to show, and
what Pittsburgh is going to be like
the twenty-sixth.
THE RETURN OF 808
MAENTZ to the Card lineup, is
a most welcome event, hut don't
start laying out your shekels in
the belief that he will prove to
he a victory spark plug.
Personally, we have a distinctly
rosy picture of this young man's
play before he was injured. But
when you spend three or four weeks
on crutches and canes, it is awfully
difficult to get back into the shape
that a Big Game requires.

It will be well worth your time
to go out and watch this boy in
action, even if you aren't particu
larly gone on seeing the California
Aggies in action. Stanford needs
something to bring back the spirit
that was here for awhile, or at least
to revive it, if you arc one of those
who believe that it is still on deck.

DOWN AT THE UNIVER
SITY OF SOUTHERN CALI
FORNIA the boys are beginning
to realize why Coach Howard
Jones has gotten along this sea
son, and why the Trojans have
been outgaincd by everybody
but Utah.
Jones knew at the start of the
season that he had lost most of the
terrific drive that last year's outfit
gave him, but he also knew that
much of their defensive strength
was on deck again, and that his re
placements made this material even
more impregnable.
So instead of trying to outscore
the entire country, he coached a
trick defense for each opponent,
alert football which won him games,
and brought his attack along slowly.
At the present rate, Troy will have
a powerful scoring as well as de
fensive machine by the time the
Rose Bowl game comes around.
