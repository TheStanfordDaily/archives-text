# WARNER TRAINS TEAM TO DOWN PUNT-RECEIVERS
## Concentrates On Ends And Tackles; 'Bus' Muller Put On Varsity 
### 
I ____________ I
Correction of mistakes has bo- j
i come the practice formula of Pop j
Warner as he sends his squad I
j through the final two weeks of
1 preparation for the Big Game, the
' last opportunity of the 1932 big red
j machine to partially redeem itself.
Two weeks ago the Old Fox
j drilled in pass defense, last week j
j he stressed protection for the kicker,
! and now he finds himself faced with j
j a new problemâ€”that of getting his 1
' ends and tackles down on punts to
I prevent a recurrence of last week's
' track meet for punt receivers.
Anderson Gets Workout
Thus last night Warner had three 1
sets of ends, tackles, and halfbacks |
lining up in punt formation as often j
!as Stan Anderson could kick the 1
I pigskin. As a result Afflerbaugh and i
i Campbell took quite a beating be-
I fore the evening was over attempt- 1
j ing to return the punts.
And so another sad mistake in
; the Card attack has apparently been
corrected. And if another serious 1
' weakness reveals itself in the com
| ing Saturday's Cal Aggie game and ,
jit is also eradicated, the Indians
j should be able to face the Bears !
I with a faultless eleven. And with
1 the squad in perfect physical con- '
' dition, there should be no alibis if
Stanford succumbs to the Bears a
; week from Saturday.
Scrimmage Ends Practice
Warner concluded his practice
session yesterday with a long hard
I scrimmage, using various combina
tions of his three varsity elevens.
Since his varsity squad will rest this
Saturday it is likely that the whole
j week will be filled with such scrim
; mages.
As a result of a Gray scrimmage
1 on Monday night another promotion
! from the Grays to the varsity has
taken place in the person of Walt
! Muller, scrappy center from Glen
: dale J.C. Muller gave Bill Bates a
run for his money during the scrim
' mage. Two weeks ago Bruce Tarver,
i a guard, received a similar promo
tion.
