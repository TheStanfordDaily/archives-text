j players who will give the Redshirts
a hard battle.
Two players on last year's Card ]
i team will clash with their former
j teammates. Don Stevick, who will

| played number one for Stanford
I last fall. Pete Lewis, who finished a
| brilliant collegiate polo career on
I the Card team last year, will ride
\ for the Circus Club at his usual
j number three post. The Redshirts
will have plenty of trouble break
ing through Lewis' defense.
Completing the Menlo line-up will 1
be two former Yale players, Char- i
ley McCormick and Jack Bradley,
who are said to be fast and flashy
poloists. Yale usually runs away j
! with collegiate polo honors in the
! East.
Stanford enters the match with a '
! switched about line-up that has
I been working together for only a j
| month. Pete Gillham and Rufe 1
I Spalding are veterans; Woody Me-
I lone played as substitute in several |
1 matches last year; Johnny Myers
i will be starting his first varsity
i match.

In a practice game Inst Friday
this team walloped the "second
four" of the varsity squad, 9-1. The
team played smoothly in this match,
and everyone seemed to be well
broken in at his new position. But
just how well the outfit will stack
up against the seasoned Menlo ag
gregation is still a question.
Play starts on the highway field
at 3 o'clock. No admission charge.
