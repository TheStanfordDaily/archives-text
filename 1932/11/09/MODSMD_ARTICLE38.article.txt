# FROSH REST ON LAURELS AFTER GRID TILTS END
## 
### Dick Strouse 
Having spent an industrious eight
weeks lulling up 221 points to 20
for their opponents, Stanford's
freshman football team will rest on
their hard-earned laurels for the
lemainder of the quarter. Coach
Chuck Winterburn is giving the
boys a week's vacation, after which
they will be required to report three
limes a week for "grid workouts un
less they feel versatile enough to
transfer to other sports.
The season included seven vic
tories and that royal 7 to 7 battle
over at Berkeley Saturday. Al
though Stanford was favored in the
Little Big Game, the tie does not
imply a Card let-down; rather it
implies a typical Little Big Game
fight in which, for the first time in
years, Stanford had material as good
as, although probably no better
than, that gathered together at
California.
Backfield Stars
Anent that material: Grayson,
Hamilton, and Alustiza need no in
troduction. it will be interesting to
see if they can meet the much stif
fer varsity competition. Guards
Laurie Rouble and Woody Adams
spoke for themselves all season, as
did not less than four ends—Mos
crip, Kingsbury, Trompas, and
Leedy.
But the varsity will need tackles
next year, and it may get them
from among Callaway, Reynolds,
and Carlson. Aif Brandon, who may
be the best of the lot, did not play
because of injuries. No one can tell
how good freshman line stars will
look on the varsity—the Daily will
print the names of the best men
NEXT year.
Substitutes Good
Three centers deserve mention:
Bob Roth of fan mail fame and
Rosenberg and Howell. Ray Lewis,
who threw that all-important pass
against California, Hoos, and Todd
played plenty of quarterback. Johnny
Reisner, Oct Morgan, Sheldon Bron
stein, and Gordie Mallatratt were
more than capable substitutes.
Pinnotti and Evarts complete the
list of outstanding yearling men.
The third team, however, boasted a
lineup that would compare with
some past frosh regulars. Winter
burn and John Bunn, who coached
the Papooses so capably, were han
dicapped by fewer injuries than
have faced a Stanford grid squad
for years.
