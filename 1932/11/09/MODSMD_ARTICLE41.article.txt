! Victory. What we asked for; what
i we worked for; what we got! Demo-
I crats are justifiably happy now!
i Stanford is being honored by the
] visit of her most distinguished
alumnus, President Hoover. Out of
i respect to this great American who
has given four of the best years of
i his life, campus Democrats have no
, further comments on the campaign.
That during the remainder of his
term, President Hoover shall re
ceive the support and honor which
'he deserves, is the sincere wish of
| those of us who are Democrats, but
| first of all Americans.
Bob Gros
Democratic Chairman
