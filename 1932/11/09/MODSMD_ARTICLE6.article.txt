Khitor's Notk: If hen Herbert I lower received the nezes of his defeat \
last niyht in his home, surrounded by his elosest friends, the only two press
representatives in the I'nited tSates present were the two Daily writers
zvliose stories appear helozv.

Gallantry.
Mrs. Hoover was a flaming torch i
of it.
The President a weary statue of it. |
Gallantry, simplicity, and aris- !
tocracy.
Up at the house on San Juan Hill, i
white flood light set up an impene- j
| trable guard around, holding the i
| garden under a steady stare of i
i noonday. Not a leaf moved but that [
I the glare showed it, and a secret j
j service man noted its motion.
Within the house there was j
J candle-light, and fire. Mrs. Hoover j
wjii like a medieval duchess with a !
twentieth-century figure. Beauti-!
fully formed, clad in a dinner dress I
of rum brown, a thong of her silver j
hair caught about her head by old,
square buckles.
I Gracious, talkative, charming,
j Mrs. Hoover moved in grateful re
! union among her friends. Her man
j ner was marvelously unchanged, as
I disheartening election figures came
j sputtering off the wires in another
| part of the house to be chalked up
ion a blackboard for the guests,
j When Jack McDowell, gray-haired j
alumni secretary and longtime inti-j
j mate of Hoover, came into the i
j drawing-room, and curtly read the j
j President's telegram to Roosevelt, j
thei-c was a gasp of silence. Then j
j heart-wrenched applause. Mrs. j
I Hoover heard the message, and j
without visible change, resumed her j
' conversation with a friend.
A four-sentence balcony speech j
Ito his Stanford student visitors I
! closed the President's weary cam- |
j paign day. Those who saw him last |
I night could not forget that terse
j wire from Secretary Hyde: " —Your
j shadow will lengthen in history."

"I feel much better."
With these words President j
\ Hoover bade good night to his
j guests and went into his study last |
j night, utterly tired, at long last at j
i the end of one of the most trying |
j campaign battles in history.
In there with him were Ray Ly- |
| man Wilbur, Mark Requa, Lawrence !
; Ritchie, his all-efficient secretary, j
land Allan Hoover, his son.
I i
In there the President stayed for
I a 'arge part of the evening, getting
j the election results on one of the
i special private wires run in for his i
j personal use. Until he finally sent;
i his congratulatory telegram he j
j stayed pretty close to those private j
| lines.
After all the guests had gone, Mrs.
j Hoover and members of the family
| dined together, but the President
himself ordered a cup of tea and ;
some light refreshments to be j
brought to him in his study. Earlie j
in the evening he had a glass of
orange juice.
The President sent his telegram
J at 9:35 o'clock. Shortly after 10 the j
! last guest departed, and less than an j
| hour later the house was dark.
The only emotion expressed, if j
j any emotion at all could be dis- j
I cerned in the absolute weariness of \
! his looks and actions, was the nega- j
j live one of relief—relief in that the i
; finish to the struggle had been writ-
ten, and that there was no longer
any need to worry.
1 That was the opinion of his close
] friends, and of the secret service
men who watch him probably more
j closely and more constantly than
; even his secretary or physician.
"I have been close to every presi
dent in the last 20 years," said one
I of these men, "and not one of them
I worked as hard as Hoover. He gave
j everything he had to the job, and
what does he get—a slap in the
| face."
The first talk from the British
Broadcasting Corporation's new
headquarters in London was on
i cooking.
The ratio of teachers to pupils in-
I creased from 19.8 in Michigan an
i 1930 to 21.8 last year.

With these words President j
\ Hoover bade good night to his
j guests and went into his study last |
j night, utterly tired, at long last at j
i the end of one of the most trying |

I a 'arge part of the evening, getting
j the election results on one of the
i special private wires run in for his i
j personal use. Until he finally sent;
i his congratulatory telegram he j
j stayed pretty close to those private j

After all the guests had gone, Mrs.
j Hoover and members of the family
| dined together, but the President
himself ordered a cup of tea and ;
some light refreshments to be j
brought to him in his study. Earlie j
in the evening he had a glass of
orange juice.
The President sent his telegram
J at 9:35 o'clock. Shortly after 10 the j
! last guest departed, and less than an j
| hour later the house was dark.
The only emotion expressed, if j
j any emotion at all could be dis- j
I cerned in the absolute weariness of \

; finish to the struggle had been writ-
ten, and that there was no longer
any need to worry.
1 That was the opinion of his close
] friends, and of the secret service
men who watch him probably more
j closely and more constantly than
; even his secretary or physician.
"I have been close to every presi
dent in the last 20 years," said one
I of these men, "and not one of them
I worked as hard as Hoover. He gave
j everything he had to the job, and
what does he get—a slap in the
| face."

Gallantry.
Mrs. Hoover was a flaming torch i
of it.
The President a weary statue of it. |
Gallantry, simplicity, and aris- !
tocracy.
Up at the house on San Juan Hill, i
white flood light set up an impene- j
| trable guard around, holding the i
| garden under a steady stare of i
i noonday. Not a leaf moved but that [
I the glare showed it, and a secret j
j service man noted its motion.
Within the house there was j
J candle-light, and fire. Mrs. Hoover j
wjii like a medieval duchess with a !
twentieth-century figure. Beauti-!
fully formed, clad in a dinner dress I
of rum brown, a thong of her silver j
hair caught about her head by old,
square buckles.
I Gracious, talkative, charming,
j Mrs. Hoover moved in grateful re
! union among her friends. Her man
j ner was marvelously unchanged, as
I disheartening election figures came
j sputtering off the wires in another
| part of the house to be chalked up
ion a blackboard for the guests,
j When Jack McDowell, gray-haired j
alumni secretary and longtime inti-j
j mate of Hoover, came into the i
j drawing-room, and curtly read the j
j President's telegram to Roosevelt, j
thei-c was a gasp of silence. Then j
j heart-wrenched applause. Mrs. j
I Hoover heard the message, and j
without visible change, resumed her j
' conversation with a friend.
