j If President Hoover visits tho
j Geology library while he is on the
campus this week he will find hang
! ing on the wall one of the maps
| which he made in 1893 while a
j Stanford undergraduate.
| In the frame is a picture of
Hoover and three other students,
taken on the day that they first did
surveying. The four, F. E. McDon
nell, Arthur Diggles, James White,
i and the President, induced a pho- ;
tographer to take their pictures for
a small sum.
| Another campus feature that the j
President will recognize is the Stan- 1
ford Union. Hoover headed the or
ganization which built the Union, j
and he himself donated the first sub- ;
scription. His idea was that as the,
University enlarged, the close con- !
tacts of the earlier years could be i

i maintained by such, a building.
I At the same time, Mrs. Hoover,
started a movement for a similar [
J building for women on the opposite,
side of the court.
Despite rumors, Hoover will not'
have the opportunity to be served j
! dinner at the same table at which
he used to be waiter. Herbert!
Hoover did not wait on tables at
( Stanford, spoiling the romantic story
I that it was thus that he met Lou j
j Henry, who later became his wife, j
The President did earn his way
j through the University, but it was
1 by more original devices than the
; traditional waiting on tables. Even
i then Hoover was noted for his or
i ganizing ability and it was through
l organizingâ€”a laundry agency, for
one thing - lhal he provided the
I necessary funds.
