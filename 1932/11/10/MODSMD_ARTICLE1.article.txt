# Ground Work Begins For Big Game Pyre; Frosh Seeking Wood
## Actual Construction Starts Saturday With Four-Hour Shifts of Workmen; Women to Prepare Food But Will Not Be Permitted to Serve 
### 
H/ITII all holes dug and work already under way on the draft ditch,
the Hig Game honlire moves up another notch toward completion
today when telegraph poles are installed by the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company. As soon as the ditch is finished, the barbed-wire fence sur
rounding the gigantic pyre will be set in place for active construction to
begin inside. Today and tomorrow will be spent in rounding up enough
material for use as fuel by members of the committee, and final details and

plans will be outlined by the
<ju.s sub-chairmen, according to I
Ben Eastman last night.
Uoyles in Charge
Tomorrow will see final prepara- j
(ions over as the powerful flood- j
lights for night work are set on top i
of the .surrounding posts. Ed Boyles, j
in charge of labor, will arrange to |
have regular four-hour shifts of j
workmen on duty constantly from j
the start of construction Saturday !
until the huge pile of fuel goes up i
in smoky Wednesday night after the I
Big Game rally.

When the whistle at the Power
House indicates noon Saturday, the
Class of '36 will get under way with
the largest man-power in recent
years. Huntington Kingsbury, Encina
Club president, said last night that
his class, larger by 100 men, is de
termined to do its best with the $200
allotted for building the bonfire.
The pile of wood will be at least
â€¢10 feet high this year, but will not
be constructed in the usual campa
nile fashion. The base will be about
40 feet square and the structure
will continue it the same width to
the top. During recent years, a tow
er-like imitation of Berkeley's Cam
panile has been added above the
first 40 feet. Bill Marchant and Cyril
Thomas, engineering students, are
completing construction plans.
Guard Against Invaders
Saturday noon the freshmen will
begin the 105-hour vigil, constantly
on guard against any possible at
tack from invaders from California
with the idea of setting the pyre off
prematurely. During the night
guard shifts, work will continue un
der the glare of the encircling arc
lights.
Arrangements for food which will
be served during the night will be
completed by Mary-K. Morris to
morrow. The women will not serve
the food this year, but will prepare
i1 for the freshman workers.
