# ROW MANAGERS CONSIDER PLAN
## First Meeting To Discuss Auditing System Held 
### 
As a step toward the co-operation
of the house managers, their first
meeting was held iu the C.id Union
last night to discuss the auditing
plan put forward by the Interfra
ternily Board of Control at its meet
ing last wee I '.
Although no definite conclusion
was reached, enough information
was obtained by the finance com
mittee of the Board, composed of
Aksel Nye land, chairman, Ike Liver
more, and Jud Crary, to permit the
working out of a definite uniform
auditing system for all fraternities
with one auditor to take care of the
books of all houses.
The fact that several houses were
not represented at last night's meet
ing prevented concentrated action.
However, when data has been gath
ered from the absentee houses defi
nite steps can be taken.
In spite of the differences in tin
problems of the different houses
which makes it difficult to put a
blanket rule concerning their ac
counts into effect, the finance com
mittee of the Board headed by
Livermore feel that a definite unity
among the house managers will pro
duce constructive results on finan
cial problems.
Twelve houses have decided to
retain the services of the auditor
recommended by the Board. This
auditor will collect his . fee from
each house as he completes the
audit of the books.
