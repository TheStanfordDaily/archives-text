# Bourbons Have To Make Good In Next Term
## In Full Control, Democrats Will Have No Alibi 
### Jay Graves 
"Hoover will be a greater man out
of office than he is as President," j
declared Walter Thompson, Profes- j
i sor of Political Science, yesterday.
? "He will undoubtedly continue as
; tho leader of the Republican Party."
The important thing about the re
-1 cent national election, in Professor
i j Thompson's belief, is the clean
■ | sweep made by the Democrats. They
! have control of congress and the
presidency, they have the responsi
bi 1 ity and there will be no alibis if
| they fail. There will be no struggle
! between the legislative and cxecu
: tive branches of the government.

"The Hearst influence has been
J greatly overestimated," asserted
Thompson. He pointed out that
Hearst supported Hoover in 1928
land that lie has had little influence
during the past four years. On the
i basis of this, Hearst will not be an
! important political factor under a
i Democratic administration.
"Garner hasn't bettered his posi
tion politically." He has a sure job
j for (lie next four years and that's!
about all. He is leaving a far more i
i powerful position for a place which j
' is little more than a figurehead's job. j
I His personal political power is I
j weakened —not strengthened.
Democrats Have Battle
i The Democrats, in spite of their j
! landslide victory have a hard row j
j ahead of them. If times gel better —j
I much better—Roosevelt will get the:
credit, just as Hoover got the blame i
i for the depression—but times must j
! be noticeably better or people will j
j be dissatisfied just as they are now.
Thompson doesn't think that
j Roosevelt will be marked in history
I as an outstanding president. Past
experience doesn't show that, "A
' president is judged on his merits."
An interesting thing just now will
be the cabinet appointments. The
Democratic party at. the present
| time contains a number of able men
| who may be chosen for cabinet
' posts.
No Beer This Year
Free beer will not be running in j
the streets by March fourth. Thomp- |
i son points out that all Congress can 1
j do is pass a bill legalizing light j
wines and beer and then have thej
j Supreme Court pass on its consti-j
tutionality. If everybody wanted
liquor and there were no obstacles
in the way, it would take at. least.
, three years to repeal the eighteenth
| amendment.
' If the depression continues there i
i will be a Republican congress in)
I 1934. Many of Roosevelt's votes were j
drawn from the G.O.P. ranks and j
! they will naturally drift back.
Insurgents Out
The insurgent Republicans are out. :
in the cold, politically, Professor
Thompson thinks. They opposed :
Hoover, so they're not Republicans, i
and the Democrats don't need them !
to form a majority.
McAdoo will undoubtedly be a '
big power in the Senate, but he j
won't be majority leader, Robinson |
will keep that post under the senior- i
ity rule. I

"The Hearst influence has been
J greatly overestimated," asserted
Thompson. He pointed out that
Hearst supported Hoover in 1928
land that lie has had little influence
during the past four years. On the
i basis of this, Hearst will not be an
! important political factor under a
i Democratic administration.
"Garner hasn't bettered his posi
tion politically." He has a sure job
j for (lie next four years and that's!
about all. He is leaving a far more i
i powerful position for a place which j
' is little more than a figurehead's job. j
I His personal political power is I
j weakened —not strengthened.
Democrats Have Battle
i The Democrats, in spite of their j
! landslide victory have a hard row j
j ahead of them. If times gel better —j
I much better—Roosevelt will get the:
credit, just as Hoover got the blame i
i for the depression—but times must j
! be noticeably better or people will j
j be dissatisfied just as they are now.
Thompson doesn't think that
j Roosevelt will be marked in history
I as an outstanding president. Past
experience doesn't show that, "A
' president is judged on his merits."
An interesting thing just now will
be the cabinet appointments. The
