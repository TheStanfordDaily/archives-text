# BONFIRE FACTS, AND A SUGGESTION

Saturday the men of will I»<*<4ill construction of their
bonfire. I nlikc hist year's Campanile affair, it is to he just
;i plain, old fashioned pile ol' wood, one that will cost Utile,
and burn brightly.
I his honlire business lias always been a good tiling. The !
purpose of il originally was In fan enthusiasm and student
support for the team 011 the eve of the Hi" (lame. Il is not
so much for that any more as il is just ;i bio event for the!
freshman class, another of those that come once in a life
lime and are never forgotten. Isul even though the interest
111 the pvre has diminished among upperelassmen as it has
increased anions citizens of Palo Alto and vicinity, normal- i
Iv il is a good tiling if only for the fun it provides for the |
1 rcshmcn.
There are ;i few facts about it, however, that the year
lings ought to know before they tackle Ibis job which, if it
is to be done right, is no less than tremendous.
Firs!, they ought fo realize that they are paying for ii
out of their own pockets, ('.bailees are that a majority of!
them did not know that. The total expense of the venture,
to be defrayed out of the treasury of the Class of \i(>, is j
estimated at approximately #200. Last year, through gross I
1 nelliciency and mismanagement, il cost more than #700.
Thai is not likely to happen again, however, since par
ticular pains are being taken to stay within the budget.
Second, llic yearlings ought to know that Ibis is strictlv
their own affair, and that even whether or not tliev build j
the pyre is directly up to them. They ought to know also
that, although the entire campus enjoys watching the blaze !
and undoubtedly does get something out of it in the wavj
of liig Came spirit, Iheie are plenty of sane, clear-thinking
students who believe il is not worth the cost.
That cost, of course, is not only in dollars. The labor
expended, expressed in terms of money, would assume!
tremendous proportions. And bonfire lime away from the j
books, though pleasant, perhaps, has put many a freshman i
in a scholastic hole.
If, and when, football "spirit" 011 this campus continues
to decline as rapidly as it has in the last few years, the day
will arrive when the usefulness of the bonlire will have
passed. That day apparently is not yet here. The Big
Came pyre continues to be a tradition in which Stanford
can lake pride.
Hut there's just one more point that might be worth
a thought. Then, if they still think they are spending their
lime, labor, and uionev lo the besl advantage, let the fresh- 1
men dig into it whole-heartedly lo build and burn a bon
fire that will he a credit lo their class.
II ere is that point. This year dollars are horribly scarce,
and 200 of them looks like quite a bit of money to send
up in smoke unless we're sure the blaze is worth it. The j
Convalescent Home could help a lot of crippled kids with
that two-hundred.
Then, 100, then- is a tremendous amount of heat gene-!
rated in that bonfire, heat thai would keep warm a lot of I
unemployed families that otherwise would be left lo shiver
through a bleak winter.
Il might not be a bad idea lo devote the energy, spirit, J
and fun to collecting the wood and then distributing il lo
those families.
Thai's just a suggestion, frosh; worth a thought, perhaps.

purpose of il originally was In fan enthusiasm and student

There are ;i few facts about it, however, that the year

is to be done right, is no less than tremendous.
Firs!, they ought fo realize that they are paying for ii
out of their own pockets, ('.bailees are that a majority of!
them did not know that. The total expense of the venture,
to be defrayed out of the treasury of the Class of \i(>, is j
estimated at approximately #200. Last year, through gross I
1 nelliciency and mismanagement, il cost more than #700.
Thai is not likely to happen again, however, since par
ticular pains are being taken to stay within the budget.
Second, llic yearlings ought to know that Ibis is strictlv
their own affair, and that even whether or not tliev build j
the pyre is directly up to them. They ought to know also
that, although the entire campus enjoys watching the blaze !
and undoubtedly does get something out of it in the wavj
of liig Came spirit, Iheie are plenty of sane, clear-thinking
students who believe il is not worth the cost.
That cost, of course, is not only in dollars. The labor
expended, expressed in terms of money, would assume!
tremendous proportions. And bonfire lime away from the j
books, though pleasant, perhaps, has put many a freshman i
in a scholastic hole.
If, and when, football "spirit" 011 this campus continues
to decline as rapidly as it has in the last few years, the day
will arrive when the usefulness of the bonlire will have
passed. That day apparently is not yet here. The Big
Came pyre continues to be a tradition in which Stanford
can lake pride.
Hut there's just one more point that might be worth
a thought. Then, if they still think they are spending their
lime, labor, and uionev lo the besl advantage, let the fresh- 1
men dig into it whole-heartedly lo build and burn a bon
fire that will he a credit lo their class.
II ere is that point. This year dollars are horribly scarce,
and 200 of them looks like quite a bit of money to send
up in smoke unless we're sure the blaze is worth it. The j
Convalescent Home could help a lot of crippled kids with
that two-hundred.
Then, 100, then- is a tremendous amount of heat gene-!
rated in that bonfire, heat thai would keep warm a lot of I
unemployed families that otherwise would be left lo shiver
through a bleak winter.
Il might not be a bad idea lo devote the energy, spirit, J
and fun to collecting the wood and then distributing il lo
those families.
