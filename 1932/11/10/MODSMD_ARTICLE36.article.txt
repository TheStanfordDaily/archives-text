# BULL SESSION
## STANFORD'S FORGOTTEN MEN 
### 
Now that the national whirlpool
has stopped its whirling and become
a placid lily pond, the dull road to
normalcy can be resumed. And the
first problem is that of "Stanford's
Forgotten Men." Who are they? The
junior transfers from other schools.
These poor creatures pay their $114
quarterly—usually have to live in
Palo Alto—sit in poorly lighted
classrooms like the rest of us—and
yet are out of the swim as if they
never had seen the water.
Some people condescend to go so
far as to admit that they exist. Some
refuse to go that distance They
have never been a very active prob
lem—for the simple reason that no
one acted about them. They just
remained—forgotten men. Person
ally, while not favoring the plan
that would have made Stanford a
university of transfers, by transfers,
for transfers, and in spite of every
one else, it does seem desirable that
they be removed from the inactive—
almost non-existant status.
A plan is in operation this quar
ter to remove these men from their
oblivion—to give them a fair chance
to become a part of the University—
even if Ihey can't punt (15 yards or
run the 100 in less than 10 seconds.
Tonight, a smoker is being held at
Branner Hall to which all transfers
are cordially invited to attend. If
the word "requested" didn't sound
like an order, it might be said they
are "requested" to attend.

I The smoker is just a beginning of
I the hope to throw a real life-line to
j those forgotten men so that they
j may become remembered men. Re
| membered in the sense that they
1 will remember Stanford and remem
| bered in the sense that others will
: remember them. "Transfer" has been
a horrid word—but the new scien
j tific process, as devised by the Stu
dent Committee, guarantees to re
j move all the harsh irritants.
| Of course, it will take more than
! toasting. It will take co-operation.
' The transfers will have to aid in
I the work. The smoker tonight is
|no ordinary obligation. Ordinary
1 obligations are unpleasant. There
| is an obligation on all transfers to
i attend; but the attending will be
most pleasant.
A gallant program has been pre
; pared. Smokes—entertainment of a
! theatrical and musical nature —and
J a series of very short talks by cam
j pus leaders complete the bill. First,
I will be Football-Tackier and Gavel
| Swinger Corbus—President of the
'A.S.S.U. Second, Daily-Editor Craw-
I ford. Third, Chaparraling Cameron
j —editor of the funny magazine.
Fourth, "Big Bang"' Eastman—Cap
j tain of the Track team, and others.
Transfers in the raw are seldom
j mild or maybe too mild—anyway,
we hope that the New Patented
SMOKING process at Branner to
night will mellow the product.
