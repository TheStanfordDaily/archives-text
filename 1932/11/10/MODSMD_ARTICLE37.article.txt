THE MARQUISE (Noel Coward)— |
At the Alcazar Theatre.
I cannot praise too highly this j
j delightful evening in the theatre, j
j The play ripples along with the aid |
i of a line cast, beautifully costumed, '
| and quite carefree.
While it might be argued that this j
i same cast overacts, that the play !
! grows too sentimental, and that—
oh, a number of things equally ir- i
relevant under these circumstances, j
I maintain that it is exquisite enter
tainment.
The players bounce through the !
! play with a gusto which proves that j
| they are enjoying it as much as the |
audience. And the sentimental
scenes never seem dreadfully seri
ous, because the Marquise is on the
stage and nothing unpleasant can
j possibly occur under so pleasant a
! condition.
In fact, the manner of playing—
I rnd this is a particular tribute to
Henry Duffy who has, in the past,
i been satisfied with disgustingly bad I
j casts —and the complete ease of the j
| players, IS the play. Acted broadly \
' for the most part, the subtleties are
left miraculously unsmothered.
Of the fortunate cast three mem
bers are outstanding: Billie Burke, j
tremendously vivacious; Allan Mow- :
I bray, charmingly gallant; and Wil- !
I liam Stack, elegantly, but not per- j
j manently stern. To criticize such '

! faults as appear would be to men
tion so many bagatelles quite un
-1 worthy of notice.
And I do not, ordinarily, advocate
j hasty dismissal of blemishes as im
material. All that matters in The
| Marquise is the gleeful, full-hearted
i enthusiasm of the players. The ad
! ditional pleasures of dialogue which
| frequently rises to what one expects
! of Coward, of sound production, and
i fine direction cannot be suitably
noted in so short a comment. It
would be far better to see the play.
