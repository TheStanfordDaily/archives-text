# Doyle Swims For Cards At Junior Championships
## 
### 
Stanford will be represented in (
the Junior Pacific Association's 220- 1
yard swimming championship race
next Sunday night, at the Olympic j
Club, when Walter Doyle, a transfer
from fU.CII/A., attempts to nose
out Ralph Oilman, Olympic Club
star.
Doyle has covered the distance in
2:28 in practice, but meets tough
competition in Gilman. Buste'r Olds,
of the Olympic Club, who may enter
the race, would also have a good
chance of winning.
The Junior Championship races
are open to any swimmer who has
not already won an A.A.U. title.
