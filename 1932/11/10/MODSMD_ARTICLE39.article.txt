The Editor, Sir:
There has been considerable dis
cussion in the Daily and elsewhere
concerning an apparent feeling of
indifference on the part of Stanford
students toward University func
tions such as plays, concerts, iec- |
tures, and even athletic contests.
This tendency is not an outgrowth
of the depression because it existed
before the depression set in. The ;
difficulty lies in the lack of an ef
fective method of reaching the stu
dents and of arousing in them a
proper interest in and enthusiasm
for University affairs.
Why would it not be possible to j
set aside a definite time every week '
for an all-University assembly? ;
The time could easily be provided j
without unduly disturbing classes
by shortening the four morning j
class hours ten minutes each on i
Thursday morning, for instance, j
This would provide a forty-minute j
period which should prove exceed- j
ingly valuable as a means of de- |
veloping and bringing to the fore
the best in both the social and in
tellectual life at Stanford.
Some of the advantages of such
an assembly would be to give the I
students a chance to hear timely
topics discussed by members of the |
faculty and administration, to pro- i
vide the students with an oppor- |
tunity to get acquainted with their |
officers, to remind students of forth- j
coming events of interest and value, j
to afford an outlet for local musical |
and dramatic talent, to get badly
needed organization of Stanford j
songs and yells (and possibly some- ;
one would be inspired to write a j
new song or two), to serve as a
co-ordinating force in student life j
and activities, and lastly to foster j
leadership and worthwhile attain- ;
ments of all types.
Such assemblies have proved j
valuable enough at many universi- |
ties to be provided for as an into- I
gral part of the calendar twice a ;
week. Surely, to try the idea once j
a week at Stanford for a year would
be a worthwhile experiment, would j
it not? Very truly yours,

The time could easily be provided j
without unduly disturbing classes
by shortening the four morning j
class hours ten minutes each on i
Thursday morning, for instance, j
This would provide a forty-minute j
period which should prove exceed- j
ingly valuable as a means of de- |
veloping and bringing to the fore
the best in both the social and in
tellectual life at Stanford.
Some of the advantages of such
an assembly would be to give the I
students a chance to hear timely
topics discussed by members of the |
faculty and administration, to pro- i
vide the students with an oppor- |
tunity to get acquainted with their |
officers, to remind students of forth- j
coming events of interest and value, j
to afford an outlet for local musical |
and dramatic talent, to get badly
needed organization of Stanford j
songs and yells (and possibly some- ;
one would be inspired to write a j
new song or two), to serve as a
co-ordinating force in student life j
and activities, and lastly to foster j
leadership and worthwhile attain- ;
ments of all types.
Such assemblies have proved j
valuable enough at many universi- |
ties to be provided for as an into- I
gral part of the calendar twice a ;
week. Surely, to try the idea once j
a week at Stanford for a year would
be a worthwhile experiment, would j
it not? Very truly yours,
Bob Rapp, Gr. i
