Oh when I drive
Upon the pike,
Wheels, alive
And funny-like,
lioll in spasms
Jump and jitter
Hurdle chasms
With a twitter
2
Bolts that once
Were firmly set
Jump and jounce
Until they get
All unscrewed.
The fenders float
Care eschewed
Like Noah's boat.
:]
"Right-hand turn"
My signals say
But my urn
The other way
Jumps. I'm far
Past half a think
Since my car
Has ta'en to drink.
