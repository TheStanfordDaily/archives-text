# Card Soccermen Spoil Dons' Clear Record With Tie
## S.F.U. PUTS OVER END GAME TALLY, MAKING SCORE 2-2 Knecht, Forward, King, Goalie, Oustanding; Teamwork Good 
### BON WADE 
Loading the highly touted, league- |
•adiug S.F.U. Dons by a score of '
-I with only two minutes left to j
lay, Stanford's varsity soccer team i
eakened momentarily yesterday at
wing Field and allowed the Hill- !
>ppers to tie (he score, giving Stan- i
>rd its second tie of the season, and '
utting a smudge on the University j
t' San Francisco's otherwise spot- j
•ss record.
The Dons, who, by the way, are |
OT defending champions, had pre- j
iously trounced Stanford to the i
me of 4-1, and yesterday's per- j
>rmance was therefore all the more j
ltlsfactory. *
Kncchl Stars
Credit for Stanford's sterling play j
jes to the team as a whole, for its i
litial show of teamwork, but out- i
anding was the work of Carl !
necht in the forward line, and the j
mazing stops of goalie Jack King, j
ing had approximately HI chances, j
id he accepted all of them without'
n error.
The Indians scored first early in
ie game, when Carl Knecht, play
ig his new position at inside left,
jok a nice pass from his halfback I
nd banged it by a surprised Don j
oalie. Up until that time Stanford ;
ad carried the play well into San I
rancisco territory, due to the fact j
lat the home forces seemed to be j
xpecting another easy victory.
Gordon Scores
Gordon, Hilltopper center-for
ward, tied the score for the first |
me in the third period, when he j
ot hold of the ball after a mixup i
i front of the Stanford net, and j
rove an off-balance shot well out !
f goalie King's reach.
But the Cards were in a fighting j
iood, and five minutes later Cy j
ohnson, at outside right, took the j
all down the field and scored, un- j
ssisted. It was a beautiful shot j
iom the edge of the penalty area, j
nd caught S.F.U. napping.
Stanford kept the ball out of
nemy reach until victory over last j
ear's runnors-up seemed almost |
levitable, and then, following a !
orner kick, the elusive sphere j
ounced the wrong way off a Card ;
jllback's foot, and the game was I
ed up for good.
Result an Unset
That Stanford should come out of
ie battle with a tie was distinctly
n upset, since the Dons have swept
verything in front of them so far j
lis season. And although there is '
ttle hope of salvaging the confer- !
nee crown, Stanford will enter the !
lalifornia series, which starts Sat
rday at Berkeley, with more than
n even chance of winning at least,
vo of the three games.
The Card halfbacks, two of whom !
re sophomores, have been impr6v
lg steadily, and against any other
jam in the conference but S.F.U.
'ill probably be able to hold their
wn nicely.
Coach Maloney's forward wall I.as j
een strengthened considerably by j
ie shift in!' of Knecht to inside left, j
this youngster continues his pres
n' rate, he is almost certain of a j
erth on the All-Conference eleven. j
lut unless the Card forwards can j
eve lop more scoring power be- I
veen now and Saturday, there will
e three mighty close battles with J
ie Bears in the next ten days.
