IT'S TOO BAD that President

students rah-rahed their re
spects to the Chief Executive

That little group made more
noise than the entire Stanford

THIS WEEK'S GRID sched

tight battles in store—if you are
finished with your postmortems
on the election, please. The
games are spread over a three
day period, Armistice Day being
on Friday and featuring the St.
Mary's-Ucla and Army-Navy
fraci. Olympic Club also plays
Friday, traveling to Reno for a
i session with the University of
Nevada.
Saturday sees the following:
Oregon U. at Southern Califor
nia, Washington State at Wash
ington, Idaho at California,
Calags at Stanford, and Oregon
State at Montana.
Santa Clara tangles with San
Francisco University Sunday in
1 Kezar Stadium.
A DENOUNCEMENT has been
fired at certain Pacific Coast sports
j writers and radio announcers by a
well-known Stanford man.
