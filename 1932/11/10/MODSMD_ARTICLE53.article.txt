# FRESHMAN WATER POLO MEN TO MEET MOUNTAIN VIEW SEPTET HERE TODAY
## 
### JACK DROWN 
Seeking its second victory of the j
i season, Coach Nort Thornton's un- j
defeated freshman water pole team i
' meets the Mountain View High i
; School aggregation at 4:20 o'clock j
I this afternoon in Encina pool. Last j
| Thursday afternoon the frosh met j
i and defeated the Mountain View
! septet by a score of 16 to 1 and will j
I be out to duplicate the performance i
tomorrow.
The game last week marked the j
first appearance of the yearlings j
this fall, and they showed plenty of j
; power in rolling up their 16 tallies, j
j Coach Thornton started his first j
j team which rolled up four goals in j
| the first two minutes of play.
Starring for Stanford was Bates ;
I at sprint, who led the scoring with ,
i four goals. Danforth, playing for- j
! ward, and Myers and Dean at'
! guards, also played good games.
Owing to the one-sidedness of 1
last Thursday's contest, Coach!
.. I

Thornton will start his reserves this
afternoon in order to make the game
more even. Livingstone, at goal
position last week, will be the lone
first-stringer in the water for Stan
ford.
The complete frosh line-up for
this afternoon's contest is Maple,
sprint; Gressitt and Nobbs, for
wards; Prescotl, center-back; Clark
and Creveling, guards; and Living
stone, goal guard.
Mountain View will probably
have much the same lineup as it had
last week with Captain Ushiro lead
ing the attack from the right guard
position.
