# WARNER ANNOUNCES SUB LINEUP FOR CALIFORNIA AGGIE BATTLE
## 
### 
For the second and last time this [
season Pop Warner will be able to
use a reserve lineup throughout an •
entire grid engagement as he sends !
in a squad of second- and third- !
j stringers against the Cal Aggies this
j Saturday in the only real Stanford
breather of the year.
The lineup for Saturday, which ;
i varies in six positions from that j
, which opposed the Army four weeks :
ago, is as follows:
Left end, Packard; left tackle, '
Palamountain; left guard. Holwerda;
center, Blanchard; right guard,
i O'Connor; right tackle, Laborde; I
light end, Ransome; quarterback,'
i Walker; left halfback, Maentz; right,
■ halfback, White; fullback, Stevens. j
That the Cal Aggie tilt will not
. turn out to be anything but a ,
breather is indicated by their rec- i
i ord this year. Their only victory
| was scored over Fresno State and :
■ they were able to tie the Southern !
j Oregon Normal eleven. And they i
! have been the victims of such teams |
j as Sacramento Junior College, Pa-i
> cific, Nevada, and Chico State. Their !
! only direct comparison to Stanford j
can be obtained in their -game with
U.C.L.A. which they lost by a 26 to
0 score.

Here Laborde is the only Card
varsity gridder who is scheduled for
any action this Saturday. Warner
believes that another workout will
help strengthen his weak knee. Of
course Bob Maent/ of the early
season varsity will be in the back
field as captain and if he plays
without favoring his injured leg, he
will undoubtedly see much action
in the two remaining encounters on
the Card schedule.
Because the left guard position is
weak in reserve strength, Warner
has switched Jack Holwerda from
tackle to guard and will start him
at guard this week. As in the Army
game some 15 or 20 more Indian
subs will be given a taste of compe
tition this week.
