"Life
is just a bowl
OR TO put it another way —"How you feel
depends oil what you cat." Just try a bowl
of Kellogg's Kiee Krispies for breakfast or
lunch and see if you don't feel keener and
fitter. That's because Kiee Krispies are rich
in energy and so easy to digest. How much
better than heavy, hot dishes.
Try llice Krispies for a laic snack. Extra
good with sliced bananas or other fruit.
Delicious, toasted rice bubbles that actu
ally crackle in milk or cream. Made by
Kellogg in Battle Creek.
