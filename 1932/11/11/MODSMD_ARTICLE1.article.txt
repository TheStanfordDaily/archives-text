# FRESHMEN SET TO BUILD HUGE BIG GAME PYRE
## Committee Hopes To Finish Preliminary Work This Afternoon PYRE TO RISE 40 FEET Night Shift Goes On Duty Sunday Evening 
### 
With telephone poles up and 1
fence posts set in a circle surround- 1
ing the sile of the California funeral 1
pyre, the Big Game Bonfire com- |
mittee under the direction of Ben
Eastman expects to complete pre- :
liminary work today and begin ac- â– 
live construction early tomorrow.
Although flood lights will be ready ,
by tomorrow night, the first night
shift will not get under way until
Sunday because of interfering fresh- j
men activities on Saturday.
Guard Starts Sunday
From Sunday morning until Wed
nesday night after the rally the field
behind the power house will be a !
scene of intense activity, with 20- j
man four-hour guard and working '
crews on duty during the hours of j
darkness under the glare of the j
powerful lamps.

The base of the structure this j
year wiil be 30 feet square. The
huge pile of wood will reach at j
least 40 feet toward the heavens and j
possibly more if enough fuel can be j
secured. Associated Oil Company j
has donated a tank of oil to be j
poured over the pyre before it is !
ignited.
Women Contribute Food
Coffee, doughnuts, and sandwiches
will be served to freshmen working j
the night shifts by guards detailed j
to this duty, according to Ed Boyles. j
Stanford women, under the direc
tion of Mary-K. Morris, are con- I
tributing the food and preparing it j
so that the men will be able to j
serve it at the bonfire without any
additional culinary work.
As last year, the guards will be ;
detailed in a widening circle while
construction continues at night in I
order to prevent any possible raid j
from invaders. The class of '35 re
calls the fact that a concentrated
attack was successfully beaten off j
in .1931, when several freshmen were I
injured in the fracas.
