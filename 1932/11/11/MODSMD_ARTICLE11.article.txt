# GAIETIES NEED MORE SINGERS
## 
### 
With the major part of selection
and casting of the 1932 Big Game
Gaieties already complete, there still
remains one important assignment
to be made.
The directors of the show have
issued a call for people who can
sing the leading parts in an elabor
ate musical selection which has been
planned. They are in search of a
pair whi will sing a romantic duct
against a background of the large
chorus and modernistic set. Thost
who try d\it may do so individually
or in couples, and should report to
Grif Williams at 5 o'clock this after
noon in the Assembly Hall.
