### ROLPH MALLOCH 
A great sigh of relief has gone
J up from the habitats of romance,
i It's the depression and not kissing
i that spreads Vincent angina infec
tion, otherwise known as trench
mouth.
Trench mouth is spreading rap
i idly—an increase of 100 per cent in
j nine years, Dr. Luckett, associate
| professor of hygiene, affirms, A re
j cent survey, started by a New York
doctor in love, has absolved the
! maids and damned the drinking
| glass.
i The depression is the medium. Dc
' pression conditions cause economy.
I Economy removes paper cups in
1 public drinking places and substi
-1 tutcs glass or tin cups. Voila! The
I little trench mouth germ clings to
j the cup and waits for the next vic
j tim.
Harmless Pastime
Knowing that kissing is no more
! dangerous than taking a drink of
j water, the amorous swain may now
! enjoy without fear the saccharine
delights of a nuzzled embrace.
The juxtapositionary contacts of
[ osculation have been unjustly criti-

. cized. Girls with damp, splattery
kisses have been under suspicion of
i having trench mouth, when, as a
matter of fact, they have been
j merely drooling with cielight.
This leaves the trench mouthers
j with no advantages at all. They
used to have at least the compen
sation of thinking the means justi-
I lied the end. Now they are looked
! upon, not as successful Don Juans.
| but merely as a little careless in
j their drinking habits.
"Academic Interest"
The survey is likely to have only
! an academic interest to Stanfordites.
; The "500"' has never been bothered
I about Ihe tendency of germs to
| roam from the original reservation.
! There is the "250"' who are "awfully
| sorry, but I'm simply not that type
of girl," and then there is the "250"
! from which the germs haven't, a
i chance to spread, burning to a crisp
j before getting to first base,
j Further study of the subject will
I bo made, but in a more optimistic
I state of mind, now that it is known
! that the great national boudoir and
'flivver pastime is not under sus-
I picion.
