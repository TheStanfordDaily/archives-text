# CAMPUS HIT BY FLU EPIDEMIC; 52 IN HOSPITAL
## Encina Claims Majority Of Victims; Sequoia Next; Palo Alto Suffers 
### 
1-ifty-two Stanford students were
forced to leave their studies on the
eve of mid-quarter examinations as
a result of the influenza epidemic
that has spread rapidly over Ihe
campus and Palo Alto community
in the last few days. The Stanford
Hospital reports that this is one of
the largest list of student patients
registered for several years.
While attendants report that most
of the cases are not serious, oflicials
are afraid that the epidemic may
spread to the extent of a similar
case a few years ago. "The students
come in with very high tempera
tures, but are ready to leave within
48 hours," the secretaray reported.
"It is just during the last two or
three days that the list has mounted
so high," she said.
Patients in the hospital come from
practically all campus living groups.
Encina inmates make up a majority
of the patients, while Sequoia boasts
second place. Row students and
several living in Palo Alto are also
registered. Evidence that the "500"
are unlikely victims of the epidemic
is shown by the fact that only two
are from Roble, and very few from
houses.
Hospital reports also show that
the flu apparently is not limited to
students, but is prevalent in Palo
Alto districts as well.
