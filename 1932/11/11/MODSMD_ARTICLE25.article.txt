GENEVA. Nov. 10 â€”The trag
edy of a fatal riot echoed through
this "City of Peace" today after a
company of young recruits had
turned machine guns on a hissir.g
crowd, killing 11 men and wound
ing 70 persons. The angry mob also
killed one soldier.
The disturbance came last night
as the climax of weeks of bitter
political agitation between Socialists
and the local Geneva government.
It began in front of Community
Hall where an anti-Socialist politi
cal meeting was being held. When
the hall became full, the gendarmes
closed the doors, but the crowd
broke through.
