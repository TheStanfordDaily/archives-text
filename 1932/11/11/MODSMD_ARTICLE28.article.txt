# Game Idea To Feature Toy on Dance Tonight
## Gordon Heche Orchestra To Play At Informal 
### 
With plans completed and most of
the bids sold, Toyon Club will pre
sent its annual fall informal to the
campus at 9 o'clock tonight. The
dance will last until 1 o'clock, with
roughs excluded until a half hour
from the end of the affair.
As is usual with Toyon dances,
this one has already proven popular
and a large majority of the limited
120 bids have been purchased. The
few remaining bids and the novel
programs may be obtained for two
dollars at the A.S.S.U. office or from
Gene Mires in room 213 Toyon Hall.
The dance will be featured by a
Big Game motif, and the lobby of
Toyon Hall will be decorated ac
cordingly. The programs themselves
have been created in the form of
"official souvenir programs," with a
ten-dance and two-extra lineup.
Gordon Heche, always well re
ceived on the Stanford campus, will
furnish music featuring his own
novel arrangements. Heche will pre
sent an eight-piece orchestra that is
willing to listen to suggestions for
requests.

Joe Gordon is in charge of the
lighting. The patrons and patron
essess include: Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Ellington, Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Wolter, Miss Viviene Church, and
Leon Carley.
