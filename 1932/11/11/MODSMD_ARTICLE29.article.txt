# Committee To Organize Campus Red Cross Drive
## 
### 
The nationwide drive of the
American Red Cross which starts
tomorrow will be represented on
the campus by a student committee
working under Mrs. Bailey Willis,
local chairman.
The committee consists of Vir
ginia Ingram, who will take care of
the women, Bob Moore, representing
the fraternities, Alden Herbert, who
will conduct the drive in Toyon,
Fred Hines for Sequoia and a nomi
nee of Marion Reich in Branner.
As yet the committee has no plans
but work on the drive is expected
to start Monday. No freshmen are
represented since they will be too
busy on the bonfire.
