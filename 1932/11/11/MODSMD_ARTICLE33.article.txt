# Subs To Carry Indian Attack In Aggie Onslaught
## Sweet, Nova, Borba Furnish Strength of Davis Eleven; Injured Men Return to Back Card Team With Maentz, Laborde in Starting Lineup 
### BOB LETTS 
OTANFOKD'S football team, with sccon'd-string men hearing the brunt
of the attack, will jump back on the winning bandwagon here tomorrow
afternoon in a warm-up for the Big Game. Coach "Crip" Yoomey's
California Aggies will furnish the passive resistance, and while the score
will probably not mount exceedingly high, the Cards' margin of victory
should be sufficient to put them in shape for University of California.
The I)av : .s eleven, long a contender for Far Western Conference honors
and several times winner of the championship, will probably give the
Indian reserves a busy afternoon, but should fall in a heap when Coach

Pop Warner sends in his regulars
I to give them a period of active or
ganization for the Large Contest.
Sweet Leads Aggies
Coach Toomey, a member of the
I late Andy Smith's California won
| der teams, will, it is understood,
* have his men using the old Smith
game of kick and wait for the
breaks, with variations. The main
, cog in the Calag team is Russell
' Sweet (not related to Montana's
J pride) who is a sophomore with
i triple-threat ability and a knack
j for tricky open field running. Most
â€¢ j of the attack centers about him.
. i Last season Sweet was named on

the all-Far Western Conference
team as quarterback, but he hns
been shifted to left half to make
room for Louis DeMartini, whose
punting and passing have made him
a worthy addition to Mr. Toomey's
lineup.
Louis Nova, former Alameda High
School star who takes the part of
fullback for the Calags, will be back
in the starting lineup for the first
time since he was injured against
Fresno State College.
Borba Good on Defense
The fourth man is Gil Borba, right
halfback, ,who specializes in de
fensive work and blocking. He will
back up the line, and is said to be a
capable man >n that work.
With the Chico Slate game com
ing up next week, Coach Toomey
wants to save his men as much
punishment as possible, so may be
forced to put in his second team ere
the game grows old.
Don't get the idea that because
the Calags come from a smaller
school they won't be tough. There
are some sizeable farmers up at
Davis, and they will probably have
plenty of beef to toss at the proteges
of Coach Warner.
Injured Men Return
The return of injured players will
not be confined to the visitors' line
up, Ed Ransome having been se
lected to hold down light end for
Stanford after breaking his collar
bone in early season practice.
Likewise, Bob Maentz, who was a
regular until he cracked his knee
on an Oregon State College boy's
shin, will be back. Maentz, at. left
half, and Here Laborde, at right
tackle, will be the only regulars
starting for the Indians. Maentz will
be acting captain.
Warner, still without the services
of Line Coach Tiny Thornhill, has
been going about his business of
preparing Stanford for Navy Bill's
Bears on November 19. and it Ls pos
sible, though not probable, that an
inkling of what is lo come will be
seen tomorrow.
