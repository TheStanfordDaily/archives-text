# AND THEY SHALL BE TWELVE
## 
### 
This noon the second period of fraternity rushing, new
style, begins. Everything has been going line thus far. The
t'rosh have been going up the How in }.iiet, orderly fashion,
and haven't been tracking a lot of mud into the luxuriously
appointed Greek abodes. Of course it hasn't rained yet,
but the absence of mud of all kinds is surprisingly con
spicuous this rushing season.
The new men's rushing rules looked good on paper, and,
with two weeks of experience behind them, they continue
to look good. Particularly laudable is the latest addition to
the intcrfraternity code, which states that a house, at a
given time and in a given manner, shall pledge no more
than twelve freshmen.
That twelve-limit rule is a ringer, the best bit of legis
lation which the Greeks have put over in three long, lean
\ears. The surprising thing was that the fraternity repre
sentatives voted for il so overwhelmingly, for it is funda
mentally opposed to the selfish interest of any one house.
How men discovered during the recent rushing of the Class
of 'X) that they were obliged to rush fraternity against hall
more than ever before, rather than the traditional house
against house.
To remedy (his weakened condition of the fraternity
case, the fraternities could not have conceived a more
beneficial antidote than the twelve-limit rule. No longer
will a few strong houses pledge large classes of pure "nug
gets" at the expense of less fortunate Greek groups. Under
the new limited pledging scheme the stronger houses may
maintain their standards for membership, while the
weaker may profit through the opportunity to pledge better
men than have been left to them in previous years. Thus
the position of fraternities in general on the campus will
be strengthened.
The new fraternity rose is not without its thorn, how
ever, for beneath a drooping petal lurks the possibility
that a house may go ahead in a sub rosa fashion and pledge
a few more than the prescribed twelve. These illegitimate
pled ges, of course, would be at liberty to live in the liall for
another year, where they might rush at will for dear old
Hho Dammit Hho. That's a problem which will have to be
worked out some wav or other.

The new men's rushing rules looked good on paper, and,
with two weeks of experience behind them, they continue
to look good. Particularly laudable is the latest addition to
the intcrfraternity code, which states that a house, at a
given time and in a given manner, shall pledge no more
than twelve freshmen.
That twelve-limit rule is a ringer, the best bit of legis
lation which the Greeks have put over in three long, lean
\ears. The surprising thing was that the fraternity repre
sentatives voted for il so overwhelmingly, for it is funda
mentally opposed to the selfish interest of any one house.
How men discovered during the recent rushing of the Class
of 'X) that they were obliged to rush fraternity against hall
more than ever before, rather than the traditional house
against house.
To remedy (his weakened condition of the fraternity
case, the fraternities could not have conceived a more
beneficial antidote than the twelve-limit rule. No longer
will a few strong houses pledge large classes of pure "nug
gets" at the expense of less fortunate Greek groups. Under
the new limited pledging scheme the stronger houses may
maintain their standards for membership, while the
weaker may profit through the opportunity to pledge better
men than have been left to them in previous years. Thus
the position of fraternities in general on the campus will
be strengthened.
The new fraternity rose is not without its thorn, how
ever, for beneath a drooping petal lurks the possibility
that a house may go ahead in a sub rosa fashion and pledge
a few more than the prescribed twelve. These illegitimate
pled ges, of course, would be at liberty to live in the liall for
another year, where they might rush at will for dear old
Hho Dammit Hho. That's a problem which will have to be
worked out some wav or other.
