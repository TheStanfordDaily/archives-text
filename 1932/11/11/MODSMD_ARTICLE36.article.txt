# A 						GOOD LOSER

### 
All the editors and politicians are in perfect and har
monious agreement that the time tor bitterness is over.
The elephant and the donkey have begun to pull together.
So forgetting all the antagonistic things that have been
said, there is a personal virtue possessed by Herbert Iloover
that deserves high praise. Without question he was as
sincere and worked as hard as any man who has ever held
the job.
Any one who was there when he accepted his defeat,
and saw the look in his weary eyes, must be sure of that.
It was plain to see that he knew he had given to the limit.
He spent on the average of 10 hours a day at his White
House desk. And very often his dinner guests were people
he wanted to talk shop to anyway. He did get some lough
breaks, but he took them standing. No one can question
the honesty of his efforts.
lie has turned his energies to the task of giving Roose
velt a good headstart, and it is not for show. He is sin
cerely doing now what he has done for four yearsâ€”what
he believes is best for his countrv.
