In answer to a recent suggestion in The Daily, Frank
Ruck, Daily C.alifornian editor, replies favorably in the
following editorial:
"In proposing that the famed Stanford Ax become a
Rig Game trophy, Stewart Crawford, editor of the Stanford
Daily, has struck a generous and harmonious note. Neither
school profits by the burial of Ibis symbol in a bank vault
and its presence at Indian rallies, with attempts to capture
it, would forever be a menace to athletic relations between
Stanford and California.
"The editorial goes on to say that those who will object
to the scheme because the Ax was originally Stanford's and
was rightfully regained will see the tradition die a natural
death. II points out that two years hence under the present
policy there will not be a student at either institution who
has ever seen it. The proposal is a worthy one that merits
serious consideration so that a tradition so closely inter
woven with the history of both institutions will not perish,
but will be kept fresh by ils newly acquired significance."
