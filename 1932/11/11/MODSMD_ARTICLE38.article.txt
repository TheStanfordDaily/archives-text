## LET'S BE CONSTRUCTIVE? 
### 
Whenever people begin to feel the
voracious red ants of criticism bit
ing them in the most tender spots—
the hue and cry rends the air that
destructive dissertations are of no
value. People whose self-inflated
pomposity has been annoyed by
some critic are very prone to decry
adverse criticism. Construction
sounds better than destruction and
so those who attempt to point out
evils are always faced with what
many feel to be their inevitable
Waterloo—is it construct've?
Aside from general belief —why
should one be constructive? It is
very possible that mistaken con
struction is infinitely more harmful
than something that is 100 per cent
destructive, subversive, and anni
hilative. For years the Babbitts have
been prating about in a thoroughly
constructive manner; and yet it
now seems that they have been
spending most of their time creat
ing houses of cards.
Before something new can be
done, the old must be exposed,
kicked, punched, beaten to a pulp—
thoroughly destroyed. That is the
advantage of criticism—destructive
criticism. Patrick Henry was attack
ing British rule long before' he, or
anyone else, had a very definite
idea as to what CONSTRUCTIVE
measures would have to be taken.
The great "Liberty-or-Death" ex
ponent may not have been the most
heroic or noble Revolutionary char
acter, but he was quite necessary.
Then, suppose that nothing better

is possible, even then are not ruin
ous attacks justified? If we are in a
hole and there seems no way of
getting out, two alternatives present
themselves. One is to lash around
and condemn the fact that our life
is confined to the one hole in ques
tion .That is the destructive way.
The other way is to pat ourselves
thoroughly on the back—smile three
times daily in the mirror—and ab
solutely pervert our mental pro
cesses so that we convince ourselves
that what we know to be a hole is
not a hole but a bed of thornless
roses. That is the constructive way.
The beautiful, sweet, and simple
way.
Temporarily—as long as the self
imposed deceit lusts —all is milk and
honey. But what a pot of carbolized
vinegar when the mist lifts! And it
always eventually does lift. There
is another danger. While everyone is
busy executing merry spring dances
in the fog to the lalse tunes of
"constructive" pipers, very often real
improvements pass by like plain
looking co-eds on quad—unnoticed.
Genuine betterments are always
welcome. Valid criticisms are also
valuable—even though they are
easier to render. The test of criti
cism should not be—is it construc
tive or destructive. The test is—
how valid is it? Most of us can dis
cover a poor omelet upon tasting it.
None of us are known to be able
to lay eggs. That is no slur on our
omelette judgment.
