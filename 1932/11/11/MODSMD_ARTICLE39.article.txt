RED DUST (Metro) —At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Here again Clark Gable plays one
of his charming, polished gentle
men, and Jean Harlow is again a
refined young maiden, completely
garbed.
This delightful pair is this time
discovered in the burning tropics,
to which come also Mary Astor and
Gene Raymond—newiyweds, and
civilized human b/sings. They go
through the routine of getting ad
justed to squalor and heat, and,
oddly enough, Miss Astor and Gable
are attracted to each other. They
arc very circumspect about it, and
in order not to be underhanded,
Gable sends Raymond, his employee,
off on a long trip. The fact that
Miss Harlow is still present deters
them not at all; Jean, being in love
with Clark herself, is very sweet
about it all.
The denouement is as obvious as
the rest of the story: Gable goes
noble, and decides that Miss Harlow
is, after all, more his type anyhow.
The film is noteworthy for its dia
logue, in that, conservatively, sev
enty-five per cent of the lines may
be misinterpreted by even the least
salacious-minded Rough.
Gable is obviously more at home
than in "Strange Interlude." And
Miss Harlow does her best piece of
work, showing more restraint of
characterization.
Mary Astor has never looked

lovelier, even in distress; Gene Ray
mond shows distinct promise as a
leading man.
For these who like their hey
nonny-nonny with a hot-cha-cha,
"Red Dust" will have a definite ap
peal. For those who are fussy, the
shorts are excellent. —Chapin.
