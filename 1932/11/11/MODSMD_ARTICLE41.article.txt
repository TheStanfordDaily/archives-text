### BY OLD DR. ALGAR 
Leaky roofs
And Quad proofs
Cause great vexation
Nomination for hero of unsung I
heroes: The man who, with his hand |
alx-eady employed by a cup of choco
late and a sticky cake at a Sunday
night supper, can toss the cup with
contents into the air, deftly grab
one of the cookies the charming
| young blonde insists on offering
him, and catch the cup, contents
unspilled, without skipping a word
in a conversation on the new con
tract bridge rules.

"Our idea of wasted effort, Boscoe, i
. my lad, is designing wallpaper for a
j doghouse."
And now that we have a new ,
president and everything is going i
I to be hunky-dory, Roscoe, the Cali- j
I coe Cut-up, will wrangle from the
| cavernous bosom of a bass fiddle
that touching Prosperity Song: 1
| "Shanty In Old Shanty Town."
1 What chance would a p'liceman
Have chasing Ben Eastman?
NEW YORK — Patrolman John j
Musgrave saw a negro stab a man ;
in the Lexington Ave. subway sta- !
tion at 59th Street today. The negro j
jumped to the tracks and fled. Mus- j
grave, on the other side of the sta
j tion, ordei'ed him to halt, then
grazed the negro's cheek with a
i shot.
Saved by a whisker!

And track fast—
