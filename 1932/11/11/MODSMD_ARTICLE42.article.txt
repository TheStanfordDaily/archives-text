# CARD SOCCER MEN FAVORED OVER U.C. IN TILT TOMORROW
## S.F.U. Starters Get Bid In Berkeley Test; Maloney Picks 22 For Trip 
### Pat Ricciardi 
With imposing season records that
include three victories between
them, the soccer teams from Stan
lord and California will meet at
10:30 o'clock in Berkeley tomorrow
morning in the first of their Little
Big Game series. Since Stanford
h;is acquired two of the three wins
and because the Palo Alto Farmers
are potentially great and have
.shown much improvement in recent
practices, the Cardinal ex-champ
ions will be favored.
Stanford will enter the game un
der a considerable handicap, how
ever, as the Indian hooters must
leave the Farm at the dawning hour
of 8:30 o'clock. Coach Harry Ma
loney will head ( he squad it Man
ager K.D.W.Jr. can awaken them in
time.
Experimenter Maloney again tried
something new yesterday afternoon,
and came up with a novel forward
wall that boasted a center at outside
l ight, an outside right at inside right,
Gas liojas at inside left, a midget
named Sutow at outside left, and
none other than a center playing
center. Unorthodox as it may seem,
this line showed manifold scoring
power against the frosh.
However, Maloney will start the
line that tied S.F.U. tomorrow. Cy
Johnson of the hefty boot and Carl
Knecht of the bothersome itch will
play inside, with Sutow and versa
tile Laurie Washburn at outside.
Art Hearn, who faces all ways on a
soccer field and yet who passes with
the best of them, will play center
forward. >
22 Get Trip
The halfback trio, apparently
staple, will again include Doug
Kennedy of the flexible right leg,
A1 Spoehr of the hard head, and
"Rough-house"' Waddy White. Cap
tain Blondie Brekelbaum and Nifty
Branch will fullback, with Bill
Krumbein, Kelly Steele, and Mac
McShea in reserve. Jack King will
guard the goal.
Twenty-two men will be given a
free ride to Berkeley and fifty cents
with which to get home. Halfbacks,
"where-are-you?" Nicoll, Red Dun
ning, and Bob Eisner; and forwards
Dodington, Emerick, Velarde, Diet
rick, and Viguie complete the list.
There will be an easy final work
out today, in which the second- and
third-stringers will be striving hard
for the trip and the fifty cents.
Junior Manager Sutter will help
Senior Manager Wade take care of
the balls, adhesive tape, and players.
