# Soccer Babes In Bear Test Here
## 
### 
The Class of '36 sends its latest
representative, the soccer team,
against California's frosh tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock on Stanford's
field in the first of this year's two
game series.
The yearlings haven't won a game
this year, but they have been im
pressive in all their showings and
stand a good chance of taking the
Bears into camp. Mission High
downed the Card frosh 3-0, and
South San Francisco won a fluke,
1-0.
Coach Holmes has not decided on
his starting lineup as yet. There
will be another practice this after
noon. Those men who are almost a
certainty to start are Laird, goalie,
Huntsberger and Martin, fullbacks,
Gomez, center half, Johnstone, right
half, Pieper, center forward, Nat
wick, inside right, Blanchard, in
side left, and Gates, outside right.
The game is scheduled to begin at
10 o'clock.
