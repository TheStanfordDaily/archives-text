###

Stanford-California football games,
the Stanford Grays will meet the
California Goofs at 11:30 o'clock to
morrow at Berkeley. This will be
the first and only game of the season
for the Grays.
Until now the Grays, directed by
Ernie Nevers and Murray Cudde
back, have spent most of their time
scrimmaging against the varsity and
among themselves. Two or three

outside teams, including San Jose
State and Menlo J.C.
Advancement of Wes Muller and
Bruce Tarver to the varsity leaves
the center of the Grays' line some
what weakened, but Semmelroth
and Cook at guards and Chuck
Bates at center will probably prove
capable enough in this part of the
line. The rest of the line will prob
ably include Beede and Smith at
ends and Drown and Buller at
tackles. In the backfield Strong and
Seaver will hold down the quarter
back and fullback jobs while San
derson and Capitelli will start at the
half positions.
