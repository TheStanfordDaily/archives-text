# Coughlin, Otis Shine At Net
## Players Improve As Round Robin Nears End 
### 
1 With the varsity net situation still
I looking up, the autumn midquarter
week was replete with some inter-
I esting matches. Interesting in that
j they show comparative strength of
| the team, beside the weekly im
! provement of some of the players.
About 18 matches in this round
! robin system will have been played
|by the end of the week. Of these
j matches, in which every man in the
; first ten ranking has played at least
one match, only two unsullied rec
! ords with no defeats are chalked up.
They belong to Captain Joe Cough
lin and Chuck Otis.
Jack Cosgrove started playing this
; past week for the first time. His
j various injuries all healed, Cos
j grove showed the effects of a long
i layoff, winning one match and los
| ing one. His attempt to change his
I strokes from Western to Eastern
! grip has had something to do with
rather poor form. Glenn Reed,
playing probably the most improved
tennis on the squad this quarter,
defeated Cosgrove in straight sets,
7-5, 6-3. Cosgrove beat Rhodes, G-l,
6-2.
Sam Lee also continued a victori
! ous streak by winning over Forney,
! 6-2, 4-6, 6-i; and over Butler by
I the surprising scores of 6-1, 6-0. In
j the last match Coughlin defeated
j Forney 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
