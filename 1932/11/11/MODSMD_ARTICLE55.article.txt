# Drofnats Goes Crystal Gazing
## 
### 
Here we have Professor Heb
ziali (DROFNATS to you) FAC
ING THE POWDER (pun by
Ballyhoo). Droffie does not
promise to repeat his last week's
performance when he picked 27
out of 30 games. The compact

mirror shown in the picture is
NOT a compact mirror at all
although it is really very COM
PACT. It is Offic-Drey's all
seeing crystal. With its help the
professor sees a victory for
Southern Methodist over San
Francisco University. They will
play in 1937. At this time Spud
Lewis will IÂ»e 5 years older than
he is now, all things being equal
and this being 1932.
