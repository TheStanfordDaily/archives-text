### AL GUERARD 
Vanderbilt and Tennessee play to- !
morrow afternoon in the second
most important football game of the
1932 season thus far. Only the Notre
Dame-Pittsburgh battle assumed
greater national significance.
Tennessee is undefeated and un- j
tied, whereas Vanderbilt was held
to a 6-G deadlock by Tulane. Ten- j
nessee is the favorite but the Nash
ville Commodores are in an excel
lent position to remove the Volun
teers from their position as king of
the nation's gridirons.
Columbia and Brown, both unde
feated and untied, play for the East
ern championship. The game is a
real tossup. The Colgate Red Raid
ers, the only important team as yet
undefeated, play Syracuse while
Holy Cross is battling Harvard's dis
organized eleven that lost to Army
46-0 last Saturday.
Second only in its titanic propor
tions is the game between two of
the country's best small college
teams, Centenary and Louisiana
State. Both are Louisiana teams.
Texas University and Texas Chris
tian battle for the Southwest Con
ference title, and the tremendous
strength of the Austin Longhoms
which defeated Rice will probably ,

By AL GUERARD

I win for Texas the championship.
The most important Midwestern
game features Nctre Dame and
Northwestern with the Ramblers
heavy favorites. The league-leading
Michigan Wolverines tangle with
j Stugg's Chicago Maroons and it
should be a picnic for the boys from
I Ann Arbor. The only other Big Ten
team with a chance of upsetting
Michigan's championship plans,
Purdue, plays lowa, now reposing
in the Big Ten cellar.
Pacific Coast football is again
subsidiary to the rest of the coun
try's gridiron warfare. U.C.L.A.'s
attempt to preserve an undefeated
and untied record against St. Mary's
i will be watched with interest. Few
are willing to wager on the game
because there is no way of telling
how the Moragans will react to their
surprising defeat at the hands of
Fordham last Saturday. The case
j will have no bearing on the Pacific
1 Coast Conference title.
Stanford plays a breather against
i the weakest team in the Far-West
Conference, Cal Aggies. Washington
and Washington State meet in their
| annual Big Game and the Huskies,
heartened by their victory over
| Stanford, should win. California

plays Idaho, or rather, will play
the great Willis Smith. Oregon
State should have no difficulty with
Montana.
The other members of the Coast
Conference are praying for an Ore
gon victory over U.S.C. tomorrow
and for copious rain in the North
west during the coming week. Prob
{abilities of a Webfoot win over El
Trojan are microscopic, but Wash
â€¢ ington may have a real chance
( against the Thundering Herd on
; Turkey Day if the Husky playing
I field is its usual consistency of ooze.
