WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (/P)â€”l
Exuberant wets arc talking hope- !
fully, if still speculatively, of "beer j
at the December session."
Their confident predictions, re- J
jected by the drys, are bolstered by j
Tuesday's overwhelming successes, j
national and stale, of a parly whose !
platform flatly promised repeal of j
constitutional prohibition and modi- !
fication of the Volstead act.
Meanwhile, Michigan's governor- j
elect, William A. Comstock, a Demo- I
crat, announced if it were legally j
possible he would grant a general j
amnesty to all dry law violators now j
in Michigan prisons when he as- !
sumes the governor's chair.
