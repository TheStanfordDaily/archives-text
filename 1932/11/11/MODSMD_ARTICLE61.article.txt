# SPALDING ABSENCE CAUSES SHIFT IN CARD POLO LINE-UP
## Melone, Luppen To Change Positions For Menlo Circus Club Match 
### Bill Myers 
Again the Card polo line-up has
been shuffled. In today's match with
the Menlo Circus Club, Luppe Lup
pen will go up at number one to
take Woody Melone's xegular berth.
Melone has been moved back to
two tc replace Spalding.
Spalding's absence from the line
up will weaken the team consider
ably, for Melone has had practically
no experience at this post, which is
the hardest position on the team to
play. Luppen will fit in well at
number one, however, since he has
been playing this position regularly
on the second string.
Gillham Plays
The two back positions are well
taken care of. Captain Pete Gillham
will play at three, while Johnny
Myers will be at back.
Former Cards Play
The Menlo Circus Club is bring
ing down a flashy six-goal outfit to
meet the Redshirts. Two former
Stanford plaj'ers, Pete Lewis and
Don Stevick, will be playing for the
Club along with two men who have
formerly played on Yale's team. The
two Yale men are rated officially at
two goals apiece, while Lewis and
Stevick will carry an unofficial
handicap of one goal each.
2-Goal Bating
The re-vamped Stanford team
draws an unofficial rating of two
goals. Gillham and Melone have one
apiece, while Luppen and Myers are
given a zero rating. This means that
the Cards will go into the game with
a four-goal advantage.
Mounts Bate Equal
In the matter of mounts, the two
teams will be about even. Menlo is
bringing down ponies for two of
their men, but the other two play
ers will be riding Stanford mounts.
Play starts at 3 o'clock on the
Highway field. No admission charge.
