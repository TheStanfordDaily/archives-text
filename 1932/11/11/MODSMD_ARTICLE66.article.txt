# Botanist Speaks Here On Molecular Research

### 
Speaking in the Stanford Little
Theatre, Dr. Olenus Lee Sponslor,
professor of botany at the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles,
yesterday outlined the arrangements
of "The Molecule in Biological
Structures."
The lecturer told of the results of
research into the construction of the
starch molecule. Dr. Sponslor began
experiments using the X-ray when
he was studying for his doctor's
degree at Stanford in 1922.
With X-ray photographs the pro
fessor found that three distinct sets
of chained molecules made up the
structures of the carbohydrates.
These are so closely packed together
that the distances between the mole
cules are measured in the ten mil
lionth parts of a millimeter.
