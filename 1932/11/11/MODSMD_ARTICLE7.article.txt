# FEDS MUST ENFORCE

### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 11 (/P.)â€” \
The Federal government will have
to enforce prohibition in California,
if there is any enforcement, since
virtually all state peace officers have
abandoned their fight on liquor fol
lowing the repeal of the Wright act j
and the adoption of the constitu- j
tional amendment setting up state I
liquor control.
State and local officers, for the I
most part, have decided that Uncle i
Sam will have to see that the Eight-I
eenth Amendment is not violated. !
