### Bob Letts 
Sending the California Aggies j
back home with a 59-0 kick in the J
trousers, Stanford's Indians turned j
their pre-Big Game "breather" into j
ci contented sigh here Saturday af- j
ternoon and today began to bear J
down for the semi-final game on I
their schedule. They play California j
tliis week at Berkeley.
On the shoulders of Kenny Affler- >
baugh and Phil Baker were heaped
the brunt of the Cardinal attack.
Afflerbaugh scored four touchdowns,
two of which were on punt returns
of 54 and 37 yards. Baker was called j
on to pack the ball 27 times and at j
no time did he lose yardage, and j
only once was he stopped at the !
line of scrimmage. He averaged 3.6 J
yards a play, good for a fullback.
Aggies Miss Captain
Coach Crip Toomey's Aggies, I
minus the services of their halfback !
star and captain, Russell Sweet,
were unable to put up any resist
ance and only once were they capa- j
ble of staging a sustained di'ive. !
Wolfe, substitute halfback for the |
visitors, was the best player the Ags |
had.

Here are the ways Stanford's
touchdowns were made:
First Period—(l) Ed Walker cli
maxed .< iiu-yard drive by skirting
Iff( Li two yards after previous
plays inside the lackles had drawn
the Aggie defense in too far for
safety. O'Connor converted.
Second Period—(2) Dave Packard
recovered i< Calag fumble on the
visitors' 14, and half a dozen plays
later Phil Baker shot one of his
southpaw passes to Afflerbaugh for
11 yards and a touchdown. O'Connor
converted. (3) Stanford needed
eight plays to go 75 yards for the
next score, laterals and forward
passes and running plays advancing
the ball to the 10-yard line, from
where Tommy Lambert reversed
through right tackle for 10 yards.
Afflerbaugh Huns 54
Third Period—(4) After several
exchanges of kicks, Afflerbaugh sent
the ball out of bounds on the Aggie
25. Wolfe returned the boot, and
Afflerbaugh skittered 54 yards to
p;iy dirt. Johnston's place kick was
no good.
Fourth Period—(s) Stanford lost
the ball on downs on the Aggie 9.
DeMartini punted from behind his
goal line, and Afflerbaugh ran 37
yards to a touchdown. O'Connor
missed the conversion. (6) Affler
baugh made his last touchdown to
culminate an 80-vard drive when he
reversed through left tackle for
seven yards. O'Connor converted.
7. Dusty Allen and Packard got
together on a beautiful pass which,
with Packard's run to the end zone,
was good for 56 yards.
8. The game's longest drive—B9
yards—was next. Lambert made his
second touchdown as the climax by
going through left tackle on a re
verse for .17 yards. O'Connor con
verted. (9) Things came to an end
when the Allen-to-Packard pass
connected for 28 yards and a touch
down in the last minute.
