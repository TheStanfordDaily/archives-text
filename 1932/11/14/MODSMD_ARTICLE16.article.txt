One term applies as well as the
next to John Williams Dobbins, chef
1 at Encina Commons for the past five
i years, and a man whose versatility
makes him worthy of a more com
prehensive title than the popular
one of "The Chef."
By a will created late last spring,
! Chef Dobbins made Stanford Uni
-1 versity sole heir to his estate. It is
' to be liquidated and a fund known
' as "The John Williams Dobbins En
| cina Commons Loan Fund" created.
I The will provides that loans are to
be made to "needy, deserving, and
capable students . . . preferably to
| students in law employed at Encina
Commons and to graduates of the
law school." The document is unique
! in that it provides that loans may be
I made to graduates of Stanford who
have just finished their courses here
j and who are entering upon the
practice of their profession or call

, in R-
When Chef Dobbins is not busy
before the great range in the En
i cina kitchen he spends his time on
one of his ranches near Lodi. Here
! he reads and studies in his library
! of some 3,500 volumes, or works in
his orchards or vineyards. Agricul
j turists, he says, are men "who work
J in a city and support a ranch."
While the Chef denies all avoca
tions other than that of a philoso
! pher, he also writes verse for his
' own amusement, reads the works of
I the great English masters, and
j writes articles for hotel trade jour-
I nals and newspapers.
He is proud of his profession, and
i is an old hand at it. While he claims
I he is "not yet over 25" he will admit
] that he was bom in Virginia "somc
| time during the Civil War" and has
been cooking for over 40 years.
Stanford students he has found
| to be the finest anywhere. Of all the
positions he has held he likes his
present one the best "because of the
j elements of social accord."
