# ROTH DECLARES FLU EPIDEMIC ALMOST ENDED
## Students Urged To Report For Medical Service; 54 In Hospital 
### 
Dr. E. F. Roth, team physician for
the Board of Athletic Control, today
declared that the epidemic of flu
that has been ravaging the campus
and the bay region is on the decline.
However, before it completely sub
sides all those who are susceptible
to this disease will eventually catch
it.
According to Dr. Roth, all the
superficial forms of temporary re
lief such as aspirin for gargling and
throat-spraying remedies are quite
useless as preventives. Students are
warned to stay away from anyone
suspected of being in the process of
contracting the flu because personal
contacts are the easiest forms of
spreading this epidemic.
Hospital Discharges Many
Anyone who is in a weakened
condition of health cither from
overwork or lack of sleep is espe
cially susceptible, he stated. Such
students who feel any change in
their normal condition are advised
to report immediately 10 hospital
authorities, or to the B.A.C. |for
medical examination.
With several of the old cases dis
charged and additional students
taken in over the week-end, the

ailment.

Dr. E. F. Roth, team physician for
the Board of Athletic Control, today
declared that the epidemic of flu
that has been ravaging the campus
and the bay region is on the decline.
However, before it completely sub
sides all those who are susceptible
to this disease will eventually catch
it.
According to Dr. Roth, all the
superficial forms of temporary re
lief such as aspirin for gargling and
throat-spraying remedies are quite
useless as preventives. Students are
warned to stay away from anyone
suspected of being in the process of
contracting the flu because personal
contacts are the easiest forms of
spreading this epidemic.

Anyone who is in a weakened
condition of health cither from
overwork or lack of sleep is espe
