Free transportation to and from
Berkeley, five cents for every copy
sold, and time enough to see the
whole game, is the offer open to
Big Game Chaparral salesmen, Bob
Savage, Chappie business manager,
said today.
Savage urges 24 students who wish
to sell the humor magazine to see
him at once* in the Chappie business
office in the Press Building as but
a few salesmen will be taken across
the bay. Leaving Stanford Saturday
morning, the salesmen will be taken
to Berkeley where they will sell
the magazine to the crowd going to
the stadium. They will stop work
in time to sec the whole game and
then be returned to the campus.
