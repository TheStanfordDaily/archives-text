# OUR NEW GUEST
## 
### 
Wandering around somewhere on lliis campus is an
old 1)11,15 named influenza. lie is decidedly an unwelcome
guest. However, past acquaintance has proved that he is
easily discouraged by a little care used by the prospective
hosts. Whether because of the depression or the election,
this particular Stanford hug has not shown much spirit,
lie is rather mild and will doubtless stay that way it the
inhabitants of the Farm combine against him.
A tentative plan of attack suggested by the medics
would be: Don't lower your resistance bv working too late
at night. Don't go without sweaters or coats on these raw
nights. Don't stand around after exercising and cool oil'.
Don't rush down to the Hospital at the first sign of a suiflle,
but first go to the Student Health Service in the IJ.A.C.
building and see if there is really anything the matter.
All those who are working on the bonfire should be
cspecialh careful to have on sufheient clothing, and to rim
back to the Hall after they are through working. The Kn
eina dining halls have made special provision for distribut
ing food to the workers after they come off duty. If you
think you have a cold go down to the Health Service beiore
going out to work on the bonfire, l /iis is important.
(ireat credit should be given the authorities of the Stu
dent Health Service for the way they have handled this
present invasion. Hcfore any cases had been reported at
Stanford preparations were made to lake care of the stu
dents who might prove susceptible to the guile of the visitor.
The result has been that nothing serious has developed in
any case. Let's give old man flu the Axe!
