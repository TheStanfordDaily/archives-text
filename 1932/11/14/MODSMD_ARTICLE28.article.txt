# SATURDAY'S BREATHER
## 
### 
Ask any coach (ho purpose ol' a "breather" name, and
lie will tell you that it is to give his team a rest before an
important contest, to avoid tin 1 risk of injuring men on the
eve of ;i battle that lie is particularly desirous of winning.
Simply not scheduling a game a week before the big
clash would accomplish that purpose just as effectively, of
course. Hut the schedule-makers apparently are loath to
rob tht" fan of his regular Saturday gridiron dish. Then,
100, it is argued that the breather gives men who otherwise
would never set 1 service, a chance to play.
Saturday's slaughter of (he California Aggies was a su
preme example of a breather carried to its zenith. In fact,
it was such a perfect example that it brings to a point the
question of whether or not the practice of scheduling
breathers is such a good one, after all.
How much (he players get out of an affair so lopsided
is a question. Certainly the poor visitors got nothing but
punishment and humiliation Saturday. And the Stanford
eleven seemed to lake little enjoyment in crushing an outfit
that the freshmen could have whipped.
Whatever the pleasure, few will deny that either team
could have gained more experience on its own practice lot,
scrimmaging with men more equal in ability. It is even
likely that the stronger team loses considerable in morale
;ind in its general playing attitude.
One thing is certain, however. That is that breathers
of Saturday's variety do no good for the popularity of the
game of football. Fans not quite smart enough to know
what is going to happen journey down to watch what has
been advertised as a gridiron contest. They go away feel
ing that their money has been taken under false pretenses.
lint if breathers must stay, let's schedule them with
teams that can at least provide ;i fair workout for the sec
ond string.
