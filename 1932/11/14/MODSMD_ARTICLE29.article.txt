# WE'D BETTER GET OFF THE AIR

I p in Seattle, Lvtlloton Tempos, editor of tlio I'niuersilij
of Washiiiylon Duih/, was dissatisfied with llic Ilusky-
Indiaii fracas in Stanford Stadium a wool; ago Saturday.
Ho didn't have any kick coming ou the score. That angle of
the contest fulfilled even his most optimistic day dreams,
hut Tempos was disappointed in the small crowd which
attended and the meager gale receipts, of which Washing
ton's share barely paid the team's expenses on the trip. The
Seattle editor lays this financial failure of the game, and of
the entire Husky season, at tho door of radio broadcasting
of Pacific Coast Conference football games.
Tempos points out that all undergraduate athletic ac
tivities are dependent upon football for their financial
support, and that tho failure of the gridiron sporl through
the agency of radio broadcasting may threaten llic collapse
of the entire student structure. He urges Earl Campbell,
Washington's representative on the Conference, to lead the
fight against tho radio at next month's meeting.
A month ago the Srwroni) Duly would have bitterly
opposed Tempos' stand on tho broadcasting of Conference
games, and, in so doing, would have expressed the general
sentiment of Stanford athletic circles. Hut Stanford lias
suffered with tho other Coast universities at tho hands of
the radio this fall. In view of that fact, the attitude of tho
Daily and of the Stanford R.A.C. has to be modified. It is
doubtful whether the R.A.C. will again defend radio broad
casts at tho coming Conference confab. The play-by-play
accounts were a fine thing and good advertising for college
football during good times, but this season is another story.
The Conference retained thorn this fall as an "experiment."
The wiser experiment for the HW3 reason, il seems, would
be to eliminate broadcasts.
