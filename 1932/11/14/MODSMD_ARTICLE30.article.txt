# BULL SESSION
## IT IS SO! 
### 
A fortnight or so ago, the propo
sition that co-eds just appear dumb
was hereinwith propounded. Just
j enough people disagreed with the
idea to clearly prove that the notion
! was absolutely correct. Following up j
i the scientific discoveries presented I
I before, a goodly number of men!
I and women were asked to make
j lists of "fancy" men and women—
the women listing the men and the
i men the women—very clear and
' hopefully statistical.
— |
The results were splendid—clear- j
I ly proving what we had always be- {
! lieved. There are no facts like the '
1 facts which prove your principles—
| or, probably, one's vague gropings—
j or, still more likely, your prejudices
be accurate. The findings showed
that all the listed women were so- j
I cially desirable and prolific—good j
J date-grabbers—men-mongers, if one [
must be scientifically perfect. The |
chosen men (chosen by the women), <
j however, were not all listed for!
i their "killing" ways at Roble jolly- j
| ups and Sunday night suppers.
j
| This is not startling news. The i
; women have always felt it to be j
| true. But now they can have some 1
j most unreliable statistical survey to i
! substantiate their feelings. Every
i one wants to rate high—if not in I
| other's, then in one's own estima- j
! tion. The great majority, however, j
; stand solely on the pillars that j
; ethers build for them. And if a i
1 woman finds no pillars, she goes off |
j in a corner, sits down on a cushion j
I by the hearth and alternately studies
| and knits.
I }
Very few sit, however. Most are
I able to discover pillars somewhere—

built by some one-cylindered jack- ;
I rabbit at worst. This creates a most
| amusing situation at any social
j gathering in which we find several
j co-eds. Each is at war agaim>t the
i other and against the field. Each is
| intent at being the highlight and the
vortex of the evening at the same
! time.

Women follow Caesar in holding
that, second in Rome is nothing to
being first in Horner's Corners or
, Gopher Prairie. Frankly it seems
i that a right arm is a mean sacrifice,
I indeed, in comparison to tossing the
j reputed magic spell over all male
members of the party to these deni
zens of the social night. The situa- j
tion becomes complex and corres- I
pondingly more amusing when the '
male tide swings several ways dur- j
j ing the same evening from one
j would-be enchantress to the other.
Dipping into engineering, we can
; liken each budding rose to a magnet
I —whose field of magnetic influence j
i is continually overlapping that of :
! the rest. The poor men are nothing
j but mere iron filings in the game— I
j pulled one way and another by the
I propelling and repelling forces. The j
■ stronger sex simply purr, "I'm the 1
' iron filing in your magnetic field." |
And the magnets' chortle; and go on
! their magnetic way.
A social evening is a diversion for j
j a man. It is a blithering, never-end- !
I ing competition—an irresistible pur- j
j suit for the co-ed. And for the '
j woman who CLAIMS to be an ex
! ception, one offers that homely little
j aphorism about wearing the shoe
if it fits. But in this regard most
feminine feet will measure about |
the same. —Abe Mellinkoff
