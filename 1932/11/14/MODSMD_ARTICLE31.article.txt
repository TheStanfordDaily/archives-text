THE WAK MEMORIAL OPERA
HOUSE—With a note on scenery.
The new opera house opened by j
the season just concluded, cannot
be praised too highly. Its simple
dignity is not only appropriate to j
any kind of performance but will
survive the usual vicissitudes in
architectural style. The arrangement
is excellent; not only is there room j
in the foyers and stairways to avoid
congestion, but the seats are ar
ranged so that any one commands
a view of almost all the stage.
The acoustics are the best it has i
ever been my fortune to meet; even
a whisper on stage can be heard in
the balcony, and as a result the
audience no longer loses the fine
shadings of a singer's tone. This new
house will form a keystone about
which San Francisco may some day
build a permanent company—the
operatic ideal realized by almost |
every European but only two Amcri- J
can cities.
The stage of the opera house is |

said to he equipped with all devices
to make good production possible.
! But as far as opera is concerned it
! need not have been. The settings
v/ere as bad if not worse than in
previous seasons. The gentle delu
| sion that if enough paint is applied
i the audience will believe anything
j is still in force.
It is true that the operatic scene
; designer has not the freedom of
other stage designers. For he must
stay by a fairly rigid floor plan,
since singers going from one com
: pany to another continually would
I find it impossible to learn a new
! set of positions for each perform
ance. But this restriction does not
excuse the utter lack of anything
I approaching common sense in scen
ery. There is no need for a set to
i be ornate, every inch of wall space
1 covered with painted pillars, door
ways, bookcases, and chairs.
