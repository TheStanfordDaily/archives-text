## ARBUTHNOT?

The Editor, Sir:
Now that has gono far enough. |
There has been too much levity in j
serious matters around this Univer- !
sity. The most recent and most |
flagrant instance has been recently j
brought to my attention. I refer j
(with regret) to the action of one j
Berkeley Anthony, humorist so- j
called, who appears in the "Direc- I
tory of Officers and Students" as i
registered from Arbuthnot, Missouri, j
Now we know for a fact, Mr. Editor, j
that Mr. Anthony is a resident and :
qualified voter of Los Angeles. We j
were at first at loss to explain this !
seeming error, but at length con- j
eluded the only logical explanation j
could be Mr. Anthony's late con-1
nection with the Stanford Chaparral j
and long exposure to the "funny j

I name" mania characteristic of that
! alleged humor magazine.
j While this is only a case in point
jof a very general and very alarm
j ing trend of conduct around the
| University, I feel it is an extremely
I serious and regrettable one. Mr.
| Anthony, due both to his former
j high position and charming person-
I ality, has been and is one of the
| most respected and most prominent
j members of the Stanford Student
j Body. I feel that it were far better
j that men of such high calibre should
I set an example of simple dignity and
! outstanding worth to the younger
| mfmbers of the student body. In
j this instance this is surely far from
i the case.
j We can only appeal to Mr. An
! thony's respect for ihe journalists'
; code of accuracy and voracity to
i attempt to rectify this willful and
j inexcusable action. If Mr. Anthony
I does not act, we believe that this
' matter should be brought to the at
i tention of Gordy Davis or Dr. Dy
j ment's office. Nothing less, we feel,
j could adequately deal with such a
j situation.
Walter Craig, Gr.
