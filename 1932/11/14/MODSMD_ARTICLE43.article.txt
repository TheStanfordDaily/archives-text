# Indians Outclass U.C. Soccer Men While Winning 1-0
## KNECHT, BERKELEY FULL COMBINE TO SCORE ONLY GOAL Careless Bear Heads Ball Wrong Way; Johnson Stars In Line 
### Bob Wade 
A one-goal lead early in the first
quarter, which came after Johnson
passed from outside right to Knecht
at inside left and a California full
back helped the ball through his
own net, was all that Stanford
needed to win the first game of the
annual soccer series at Hilgard
Field Saturday.
The first quarter, with Stanford
on the down-hill run, was pretty
much California, except for the
fatal moment when a careless Bear
headed the ball the wrong way, and
thus unwittingly gave the game to
the Indians. The ball was on the
Hedshirts' side 'if the center line
almost continually, but the strong
Stanford defense kept the Bears
from getting a good .shot at goal.
Plenty of Shots
In the second period, with the
up-hill run against them, the Cards
woke up and bejjan battering the
Bear goal with kicks from all angles
and positions. But good work on
the part of California's goalie, and
too many posts around the net kept
the score at 1-0 as the half ended.
The third period was all Stanford,
without the Indians being able to
run up the score. Johnson moved to
center forward, and Hearn shifted i
out to the wing, in an attempt to |
give Johnson a much-needed rest, |
and to get his hard kicking in front j
of the goal where it would do some i
good. But although the Cards kept .
the ball in Bear territory, and had j
a number of seemingly cinch shots, !
the score was still .1-0 as the teams J
changed sides for the start of the ;
last period.
Kennedy Saves Goal
The final quarter was a complete !
picture of a very tired team trying i
to stave oft Ihe last-minute rush of j
a frantic bunch of Bears. With five
minutes left to play, California's left j
hall took ihe ball down to scoring |
territory almost unassisted, and only j
a sliding stop by center half Doug |
Kennedy probably saved Stanford I
from a tie game.
Outstanding for the Indians were j
Knecht and Johnson in the forward j
line, Captain Erwin Brekelbaum at i
fullback, and Goalie Jack King. j

The final quarter was a complete !
picture of a very tired team trying i
to stave oft Ihe last-minute rush of j
a frantic bunch of Bears. With five
minutes left to play, California's left j
hall took ihe ball down to scoring |
territory almost unassisted, and only j
a sliding stop by center half Doug |
Kennedy probably saved Stanford I
from a tie game.
Outstanding for the Indians were j
Knecht and Johnson in the forward j
line, Captain Erwin Brekelbaum at i
fullback, and Goalie Jack King. j
A one-goal lead early in the first
quarter, which came after Johnson
passed from outside right to Knecht
at inside left and a California full
back helped the ball through his
own net, was all that Stanford
needed to win the first game of the
annual soccer series at Hilgard
Field Saturday.
The first quarter, with Stanford
on the down-hill run, was pretty
much California, except for the
fatal moment when a careless Bear
headed the ball the wrong way, and
thus unwittingly gave the game to
the Indians. The ball was on the
Hedshirts' side 'if the center line
almost continually, but the strong
Stanford defense kept the Bears
from getting a good .shot at goal.
Plenty of Shots
In the second period, with the
up-hill run against them, the Cards
woke up and bejjan battering the
Bear goal with kicks from all angles
and positions. But good work on
the part of California's goalie, and
too many posts around the net kept
the score at 1-0 as the half ended.
The third period was all Stanford,
without the Indians being able to
run up the score. Johnson moved to
center forward, and Hearn shifted i
out to the wing, in an attempt to |
give Johnson a much-needed rest, |
and to get his hard kicking in front j
of the goal where it would do some i
good. But although the Cards kept .
the ball in Bear territory, and had j
a number of seemingly cinch shots, !
the score was still .1-0 as the teams J
changed sides for the start of the ;
last period.
