Newspaper men, who constitute a
[sort of unofficial or non-collegiate
j publicity bureau for all large uni
versities that issue free press passes
to their big games, have recently
adopted the practice of christening
one or more stars of each team as
"Hard Luck This" or "Herd Luck
That." The idea has the merit of
adding a new angle to an over
worked sports vocabulary as well
as making it possible to keep the
particular university's team in the
headlines during the middle of the
week when news is scarce.
Thus there was "Hard Luck
Hank" Schaldach over at Berke
ley and "Hard Luck Bill" Beas
ley at St. Mary's and "Hard
Luck Orv" Mohler down South.
And now Stanford comes out
with a hard luck story all its
own.
Bob Maentz is the story's hero,
and Bob has a rather good claim as
a worthy rival of Schaldach. Her
alded as perhaps the trickiest prep
school back in the country before
coming to Stanford and a star of
the Class of '34's freshman team,
Maentz was all set to be the regular
left half this year when a knee gave
way in the Oregon State game.
I Came and went weeks of hydro
therapy treatment, walking with a
cane, and no football for Maentz.

Came also the California Aggie,
game, in which Bob was supposed
to start, in order to loosen up that
knee for the storming of the Bear
stronghold Saturday. Came finally
the flu, just an hour before the
game, and Maentz spent the after
noon in the hospital—playing foot
ball with a radio.
Then too, there is "Hard Luck
Here" Laborde. Here's trick knee
has caused him a number of
tough breaks, but it is really
too bad from the point of view
of the Bay region sports writers
that Laborde hasn't been out of
the game more of the time. They
might then have played up the
"Ha.d Luck Here" angle a bit
more: the alliteration is nearly
perfect.
While speaking of tackles, there
is "Hard Luck Red" Gribben, with
a less musical nickname but a worse
knee than has Laborde. Red has
been limping on and off Stanford
football fields for two years now:
, undeniably a fine tackle, but sadly
'handicapped by injuries.
Then there is Jack Holwerda, who
has had the hard luck to always
S play the wrong position at the right
time. Shifted from one side of the
line to the other and from tackle to
guard, Holwerda now knows signals
for so many positions that he may

well start, or at least play a con
siderable part of the Big Game. Hol
werda was a guard against the Ag
gies of Ted Kite's injury.
As a matter of information at
tempted to offset a bit of the
Chronicle's painful misinformation,
the Stanford Daily takes great
pleasure in printing the correct
standing of the teams in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Soccer Con
ference. This listing includes Stan
ford's 1 to 0 victory over California
I Saturday, in which Goalie Jack King
I played one whale of a game for the
j Cards.
