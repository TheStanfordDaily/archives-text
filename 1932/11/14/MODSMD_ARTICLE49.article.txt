# SEAVER, ZACHES STAR FOR CARDS AS GRAYS SMEAR U. C. GOOFS, 13-6
## 
### 
The Stanford Grays settled their |
version of the Big Game at the
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley
Saturday by defeating the California \
Goofs 13 to 6, and by outplaying j
their rivals much more decisively
than the score indicates. Charley i
Seaver, star backfield man of the
day, made both touchdowns. Seaver
was perceptibly aided by Paul
Zaches, whose flashy runs helped >
put the ball in scoring position.
Nervousness caused by a late ar
rival affected the Grays' play dur- ,
ing the first quarter, and the period
ended with California on the long
end of a 6 to 0 score. Angelman
starred for the Goofs by returning j
a punt 55 yards for a touchdown.
Seaver Goes Over
With this brief letdown behind
them the Grays settled down to real
work during the second quarter and
with Seaver and Zaches carrying l
the ball pushed down to the 9-yard 1
line, where Seaver went off tackle |
for the remaining distance and a j
touchdown. The conversion attempt I
failed.
After the intermission the Grays!
came back and started in wherej
they had left off. A sustained drive 1

[Straight down the field landed them j
on the Goof 1-yard line where
Seaver plunged over for the touch- !
down. Zaches converted this time, j
; The rest of the half was all Stan- j
' ford.
Seaver through the line and j
Zaches around end and off-tackle j
were the leading ground-gainers for j
Stanford. Capitelli's long punts from j
behind his own goal line pulled the !
Grays out of a hole more than once j
; during the first part of the game, ;
, and Ed Strong proved a capable j
quarterback, playing a good all
around game.
Muller Best Lineman
Wes Muller, playing with the ;
Grays in spite of his announced shift
to the varsity, was acting captain
and easily the best lineman on the
field. Beaty and Smith turned in j
good games at the ends. The starting j
1 lineup consisted of Muller at cen- ;
; ter, Semmelroth and Cook at guards, i
Drown and Buller at tackles, Smith j
j and Steiner at ends, Sanderson and |
i Flippen at halves, and Strong and
Seaver at quarterback and fullback.
Lawn bowling is a popular sport
