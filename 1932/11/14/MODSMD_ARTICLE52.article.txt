Student's financial problems is the
i general subject of this discussion of
Student Problem Aids which is be
ing sponsored by the Student Com
mittee at Stanford Dr. Wrenn says:
Financial Problems
A student's money worries are apt
to center around either tuition needs
or board and room money. For the
1 former see the individual listed be
' low under 1, 3. For board and room
I money or money for incidentals, see
,2, 4, 5.
A student should not come to a
j college for the first {ime without
| having tuition money for at least
i three quarters and money for other
' needs for at least one quarter.

You should not plan on too much
outside work, however. The exper
ience of both the Scholarship Secre
tary and the Student Employment
Secretary testify to the danger of
working on a job more than three
hours a day.
When part-time jobs must be se
cured, you should certainly enroll
with Mrs. Spenner, but your own
initiative should not stop there. See
suggesitons under 6.
