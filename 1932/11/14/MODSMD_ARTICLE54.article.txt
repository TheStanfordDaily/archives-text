# Stanford Polo Quartet Beats Circus Club, 7-6
## 
### 
Aided by a four-goal handicap,
Stanford's polo team defeated the
Menlo Circus Club 7 to G Friday
afternoon on the Stanford field.
Woody Melone, a substitute last
year but now very much of a regu
lar, led the Indian attack with Cap
tain Pete Gillham as his co-star.
Stanford's individual work was
excellent for so early in the season,
and Melone and Gillham, along with
Lupe Luppen and Johnny Myers,
showed promise of developing into
an outstanding quartet. The team,
however, obviously lacked team
work and experience. Rufus Spald
ing, a regular for two years, did not
play Friday.
