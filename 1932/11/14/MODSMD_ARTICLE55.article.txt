# Junior, Senior Women To Meet In Hockey Tilt
## 
### 
Juniors and seniors will decidc a
season-old controversy this after
noon, when they meet in the open
ing game of the W.A.A. hockey
series.
The two teams have been practic
ing together all quarter, without
either's showing any conclusive
superiority. The outcome of today's
contest will probably be decided
more by enthusiasm than by caliber
of playing, since both squads lay
claim to fine players.
