This picture was taken in London recently when unemployed
from the industrial centers of England gathered for a mass demon
stration. During the severe rioting that ensued, London's worst in
many years, scores were hurt and many arrested. This demonstrator
is being hustled away by bobbies after his arrest at the height of
the rioting. (Associated Press Photo)
