# Weak Frosh Soccer Team Fights Bear Cubs To Tie
## 
### 
After a scoreless first half, the
Stanford freshman soccer squad
overcame its stage-fright, scored its
lone goal, only to allow the Bear
Cubs to tie the score again in the
fourth quarter of the Little-Big
Game on the Stanford field ilast
Saturday morning.
The final score of 1-1 just about
shows the relative strength of the
two teams as they appeared on the
field; California, a shabby, poorly
equipped outfit if there ever was
one, and Stanford, looking green
and inexperienced and totally devoid
of the fine form it has been dis
playing in its scrimmages with the
varsity during the last week.
When Coach Holmes' Indian year
lings finally did shake off their un
necessary nervousness, it was Nat
wick, inside right, who kicked the
goal. The California kick that tied
the score came at a decided angle
right across the goal early in the
fourth quarter.
