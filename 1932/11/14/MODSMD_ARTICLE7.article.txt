! English physiologist and co-worker
i of Julian Huxley, will speak at the
University Assembly at 11 o'clock,
! Tuesday morning, on the subject of
j "Bad Air." The effect of "Bad Air"
• on human physiology will form the

I point out the way in which the
i human body reacts to these unusual

i Professor of Physiology in the Royal
' Institute, but he occupies the posi
