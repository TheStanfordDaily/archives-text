# BONFIRE CREW STARTS ACTUAL WORK ON PYRE
## Outside Walls Now Under Construction; Barbed Wire Fence Up 
### 
Snapping out of the apparent lack
of interest in their work as shown
on Friday and Saturday, the fresh
men of '36 got down to business
with a vengeance yesterday when
a crew of about 57 men began actual
construction on this year's Big Game
bonfire.
As the night shifts of guards
settled down to the task of making
the field behind the power house
resemble an armed camp as a pre
caution against possible invasion by
Blue and Gold forces intending to
set fire to the gigantic pyre prema
turely, the full moon found all tele
phone poles up, the draft ditches
completed, a barbed wire fence com
pletely surrounding the framework,
and a good portion of the outside
walls already in place.

Anyone who is still able to supply
wood or other fuel for use in con
struction of this year's burning of
California's hopes is asked to com
municate immediately with the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union.
The bonfire committee will send
trucks to call for the materials at
once.
No Niyht Work
Following a meeting of officials
yesterday, it was announced that al
though the 35-40 man guard shifts
would be maintained at four-hour
intervals during the night, no labor
would be done because of possible
ill effects during the present epi
demic of influenza.
All freshmen discharged from the
hospital this week are being ordered
not to do any work on the bonfire
at any time, but to stay inside and
take proper care of themselves. Also
any members of the class of '36 who
feel any symptoms of the current
epidemic are requested to report
immediately at the B.A.C. for medi
cal examination. This latter request
is even more for self-protection than
for the purpose of spreading the
malady, although both purposes will
be served if the instructions are
carried out.
Lights To Be Installed
Three powerful lights will be in
stalled today by the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company to aid in the night
work. Yesterday the men were
forced to do their guard duty by
the light of a full moon and several
small bonfires.
Men working on the night guard
shifts are served coffee and sand
wiches prepared by Stanford women
under the supervision of Mary-K.
Morris.
Freshmen are asked to come out
today and do all the work possible
in order to make up for the ex
tremely poor showing last week-end.
