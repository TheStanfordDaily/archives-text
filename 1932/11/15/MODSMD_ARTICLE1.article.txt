Fifteen new cases have been hos- j
pitalized, bringing the total of
stricken students to Gl, with 50 in '
the Palo Alto Hospital.

Predict Abatement
That the queer fly-by-night dis- !
ease might suddenly abate itself by
Saturday, Big Game Day, as a simi- j
lar campus flu epidemic did three !
years ago, was the hope expressed J
by Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director !
of the School of Hygiene, in citing j
the gradual decline of the cases.
Ernie Caddel, star right halfback, j
was among yesterday's victims or- j
dered to the hospital, making his >
participation in the Big Game a
question of immediate concern. Be- ,
sides the hospital cases, 11 were re- |
ported under care in the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes.
