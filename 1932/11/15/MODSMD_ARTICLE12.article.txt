# 'BEAR' RAIDERS THREATEN PYRE
## Rumors Indicate Plot Was Of Local Origin 
### 
Leaping and shouting, brandishing
red flares, and scaring the living
daylights out of the freshman
guards, a handful of men wearing
California rooters' hats attacked the
Big Game bonfire at 9:15 o'clock last
night.
They made a brave attempt to
reach the big pile of wood, but the
best they could so, surprisingly, was
to ignite a brush pile about 25 yards
away, and the feet of Ben Eastman
and other authorities soon stamped
out the recalcitrant embers.
Guards who tangled with the raid
ers in physical combat were hteard
to remark on the incongruity of the
same men wearing Blue and Gold
hats and Cardinal belt buckles, but
no one in authority could be reached
for questioning on this point last
night.
When the power house whistle
sounded the alarm and hundreds of
students flocked to the scene, the
whole raiding party apparently
melted into the crowd. The only
thing left to satisfy the onlookers'
hunger for excitement was the oft
repeated livid tale of the "California
raid," which story was described in
glowing terms by some of the stu
dent officials in charge of the pyre
building.
A few students who did not get
near enough to see the gleaming
belt buckles stoutly maintained that
the attackers were bona fide Berke
leyites.
