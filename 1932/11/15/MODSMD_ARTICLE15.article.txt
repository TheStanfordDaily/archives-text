# Campus Cop's Business Drops During Depression
## 
### 
A general economic depression,
t world-wide in its implications, and
additional individual care on the
part of Stanford students, campus
i wide in its effects, have combined
I to make Senator Stanford's ex-farm
a safer and saner place for motor
; isls. That is the opinion of Gordon
Davis .popular campus cop, as ex
pressed to the Daily in a recent in
j terview.
This has been a rather uneventful
quarter as far as concerns campus
traffic violations, Davis says. Speed
i ers do not abound as in previous
I years. The few students who have
felt the wrath of the law seem suf
ficiently quieted by their experiences
to cause no further trouble. There
has been but one accident reported
this term —and that when a badly
! lighted car ran into a ditch dug
j across the torn-up county road back

1 of Roble.
According to Officer Davis, this
i sobriety of driving, besides being |
influenced by the tempering effect j
of the present economic situatiton
: and unhappy reminiscences of past !
tickets, is due mainly to the fact .
that people, for some unknown rea- '
! son, are just more careful this year. !
He went, on to say that the stu- j
dents appear only too glad to co- 1
operate with the campus police of- I
ficials. This was shown by the prac- j
Mical absence of repeated charges.
He asserted that the students' ,
sportsmanship in such matters is
unequaled anywhere.
Davis has been asked by State
Highway Patrol officers whether his ;
job doesn't seem to him to be rather I
uninteresting at times. His laconic
answer was, "It's a pleasure to work !
ion the campus with such a fine
j bunch!"
