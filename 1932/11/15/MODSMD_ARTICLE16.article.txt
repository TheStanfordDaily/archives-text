# INJUN NOTABLE MAY WHOOP UP CAMPUS BALLY
## Chief Running Water To Arrive Here For Big Game Rally 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Chief Hot - and - Cold - Running
Water will be on the campus to
morrow night!
According to word received by
Rally Committeeman Chairman Bob
Churchill late yesterday, the famed
Canadian hunter and war chief will
reach his old stamping ground in
time for the Big Game rally in the
Pavilion at 7:10 o'clock.
If it is humanly possible, the
Chief will be here in time to lead
the torchlight parade down the Row
from the Fiji house at 7 o'clock.
Known as "Drofnats"
Plenty of surprises and unusual
trophies are promised the local In
dians and their '"00" squaws when
Running-Water, the youngest ehief-

lain in his tribe's history, strides
into the Pavilion tomorrow. The
Chief is especially welcome here at
his alma mater in view of the fact
that he has not visited the Stanford
campus since his graduation in 1921.
He was enrolled under his English
name, which is Johnny Drofnats.
During recent weeks, from his
observatory in the Canadian Rockies
in the province of Alberta, Drofnats
has been making remarkably ac
curate predictions on the outcome of
the major American football contests
in the United States. These have
appeared exclusively each week in
the Stanford Daily.
Meanwhile, ever-increasing rum
blings from the stronghold of the
rough indicate the completion of Se
quoia's coffin, which will be a fea
ture of the parade. Sequoia men will
march in a body from the hall up
the Row to the Fiji house, fall in at
the head of the parade with the
band, and continue on down the
regular route to the Pavilion.
Cards for Admission
Admission will be strictly by stu
dent body cards or visitors' tickets,
it was stressed again. Only 1600
outsiders will be admitted and until
the supply of ducats is exhausted
Stanford students may procure two
each without charge upon applica
tion at the A.S.S.U. offices in the
Old Union.
With the skit all ready for pre
sentation, the speakers and every
thing in readiness, the Rally Com
mittee promises plenty of pep and
spirit for a short and snappy rally.
Visitors are warned to reach the
Pavilion ahead of the procession of
roughs on foot and in automobiles
to avoid any congestion when the
rally starts.

Stanford students may procure two
each without charge upon applica
tion at the A.S.S.U. offices in the

With the skit all ready for pre
sentation, the speakers and every
thing in readiness, the Rally Com
mittee promises plenty of pep and
spirit for a short and snappy rally.
Visitors are warned to reach the
Pavilion ahead of the procession of
roughs on foot and in automobiles
to avoid any congestion when the
rally starts.
Chief Hot - and - Cold - Running
Water will be on the campus to
morrow night!
According to word received by
Rally Committeeman Chairman Bob
Churchill late yesterday, the famed
Canadian hunter and war chief will
reach his old stamping ground in
time for the Big Game rally in the
Pavilion at 7:10 o'clock.
If it is humanly possible, the
Chief will be here in time to lead
the torchlight parade down the Row
from the Fiji house at 7 o'clock.
Known as "Drofnats"
Plenty of surprises and unusual
trophies are promised the local In
dians and their '"00" squaws when
Running-Water, the youngest ehief-

lain in his tribe's history, strides
into the Pavilion tomorrow. The
Chief is especially welcome here at
his alma mater in view of the fact
that he has not visited the Stanford
campus since his graduation in 1921.
He was enrolled under his English
name, which is Johnny Drofnats.
During recent weeks, from his
observatory in the Canadian Rockies
in the province of Alberta, Drofnats
has been making remarkably ac
curate predictions on the outcome of
the major American football contests
in the United States. These have
appeared exclusively each week in
the Stanford Daily.
Meanwhile, ever-increasing rum
blings from the stronghold of the
rough indicate the completion of Se
quoia's coffin, which will be a fea
ture of the parade. Sequoia men will
march in a body from the hall up
the Row to the Fiji house, fall in at
the head of the parade with the
band, and continue on down the
regular route to the Pavilion.
