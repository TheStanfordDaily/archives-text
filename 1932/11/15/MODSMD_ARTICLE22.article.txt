# CONTRAST SOVIET WORKER STATUS
## Revolution Research Chief Lectures Tonight 
### 
Speaking on "The Russian Work- ;
er and His Government" at 7:30
o'clock tonight in the Little Theatre,
Professor H. H. Fisher, chairman of
the Committee on Russian Research,
will contrast the political status of j
labor in the Soviet Union with the >
position of workers in other coun
tries.
Historical background of Russian
workers previous to the Bolshevik j
revolution and the relation of the |
Communist Party to the proletarian j
dictatorship will be outlined defi
nitely by Professor Fisher.
As chairman of the research com- !
mittee, he is directing the task of
collecting and editing documents and :
other material on the revolution and
the present Soviet regime. This com
mittee maintains contact with Euro
pean agencies also engaged in com
piling information on developments j
in the Union of Socialist Soviet Re- j
publics.
In 1929 Fisher spent six months
in Central and Eastern Europe gath- \
ering such material for the Hoover I
War Library, acquiring, among
other valuable additions, the fam- j
ous Czibor Collection of Hungary,
relating to the Communist reign in
that copntry during 1919.
