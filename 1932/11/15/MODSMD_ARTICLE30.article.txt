# Big Game Pyre Tomorrow Ends Long Frosh Vigil
## Wood Needed, Workers Scarce, Indifferent as Work Speeded Up To Be Done in Time for Rally; Six Whistles Signal of U.C Raid 
### 
THE last 36 hours begin this morning when classes start at S o'clock.
* The long, final vigil of the Class of '36, after three days of labor on thÂ«
1!>32 edition of the Big Game bonfire, will end tomorrow night when
the gigantic pyre goes up in a blaze of glory along with California's
gridiron hopes, according to ambitious freshmen.
In spite of an exceptionally large turnout of workers on Sunday, tliosn
in charge yesterday expressed extreme disappointment at the meager
group of freshmen who attempted to carry on the construction.
Late last night the lower half of the framework had been completed
and partially filled in with the aid of an endless chain of men seated on
telephone pole ladders built against

llic structure.
In anticipation of any possible
| raid on the bonfire before tomorrow
night, 40-man guard shifts are* to
!be maintained all night with in
| creased vigilance, it was announced.
Freshmen Indifferent
The greater part of the construe
! tion is yet to be done ,and it had

been expected that with the largest
freshman class in recent years, the
giant woodpile could be finished
easily by schedule. Thus far, ac
cording to the bonfire committee,
the freshmen have shown an un
equalled lack of interest in their
work and have been practically in
different to pleas that they help to
complete Ihe structure on time.
As tonight is the last night before
the blaze is set to illuminate the
Farm, campus residents and fresh
men especially are asked to listen
for any sound ox the siren from the
power house during the night. Six
blasst will indicate a raid.
The blaze will be set off immedi
ately after the rally in the Pavilion,
probably about 7:45 o'clock tomor
row night. John Ulrich, engineering
student, has been supervising the
construction. Phelps-Terkel have
supplied workers with gloves free
of charge.
