# HOW ABOUT IT, FROSH?

### 
II is certain thai :i majorily of I lie students favored
staging the Rig (lame bonfire this year, and that the fresh
men indicated a willingness lo hnild it. Otherwise com-J
mittccs would nol have "one ahead and scheduled tin' con
struction, and the ('.lass of \'W would not have budgeted
more Hum $200 out of its treasury.
True, there would have been a chorus of squawks from
alumni and students alike if the frosh had acted on the
suggestion of the Daiiy and abandoned it in (his year of
emergency. Hut thai chorus would be a mere murmur be- i
* . .... ... I
side the wail that will arise if the yearlings* fail now, after
actual construction has begun.
The frosh have been given their pyre. Everything that
could be done for them has been done. Committees have
spent strenuous hours arranging details, and digging up
wood at a lime when wood is as scarce as everything else.
Yet now, with but thirty-six hours remaining before ;
the scheduled igniting of the pyre, the yearlings arc shirk
ing the task I hey laid out for themselves. Committees that
proceeded with plans conlident of support from an en
thusiastic Encina delegation are having to plead, cajole,]
exhort, and even browbeat the freshmen lo get them to
work.
The time is short, and the task tremendous. Hut it is!
still nol 100 late for the men of \'W to prove that they meant
it when Ihev asked for this bonfire.
