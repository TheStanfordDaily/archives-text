# FORD IN REVERSE
## 
### 
Henrv Ford, leading citizen of Detroit, who recently i
was urging his employees to follow the wiser course and ;
cast their ballots for Herbert Hoover, appears to have be-j
come slightly reconciled to tin 4 election of Franklin l).l
Roosevelt. Thai is, he sees a faint glimmer of hope for the
nation, if the next administration slicks to the Democratic j
platform, which, paradoxically enough, Ford opposed dur
ing the campaign.
Hut Ford, in realigning his political faith with the low-!
tariff, free trade tenet of the Democratic party, has gone i
lo an extreme. As he said in a copyrighted interview with ,
the Hoslon American, "I think business will begin to im
prove at once if the Democrats establish free trade. If the |
money system of this country is changed, tariff abolished 1
and free trade established throughout the world we will j
see a new term of hope, optimism, prosperity and happi
ness.'"
Ford has gone the Democratic party one better on the |
tariff theory, one worse should there be a possibility of
his cure-all being attempted in actual practice. The Demo
crats stand for the free trade principal, granted, but they
do not propose anything so suicidal for the United Stales
as an immediate switch from high tariff to none at all in j
times like these.
It's a good thing for the popularity of the Democratic!
administration-to-be that Ford does nol have the political 1
following which he must have imagined he had at the lime
he carried on his pseudo-campaign for Hoover. For-I
Innately there will nol be many who will pay enough heed
to Ford's political remarks lo criticize the Roosevelt regime j
when that administration fails to attempt such a foolhardy
program as the automobile manufacturer suggests.
