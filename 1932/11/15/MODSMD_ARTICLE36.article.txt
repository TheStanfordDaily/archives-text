# DOES IT PAY?

II seems In he a favorite pastime of professors in
schools of business to try to figure out whether or not it
pays to go to college. From their reports, of course, ii al
ways pays. The most recent investigator is Prof. James C.
Kgbert, of the Columbia I Diversity Business School, whose
report shows business school graduates earning annual
salaries ranging from $.'WO to $100,(KM).
One item that is noticeably lacking in most attempts to
determine the value of a college diploma is the amount
of the expenditure necessary to get the diploma. In any
business venture, in order to figure the ultimate profit
one must begin with the original expense which must be
deducted Irom the returns. Therefore, in figuring out the
value o! a college education, its cost should be considered
and not just the graduate's salary.
I he wide range between the salaries of graduates, $,'5(10
to $100,000, would indicate that a college education is not
always a paying proposition. A college education is of
value only in proportion to the graduates ability to make
use ot such education. As many an unemployed graduate
can tell you, college is no royal road to success. What you
get out of college depends largely on what you bring to it.
If you are the $100,000 man, you may require the Univer
sity to help you attain the maximum of your potential
ability. Hut if you are the $.'U)O-a-year man you are wasting
your time and money in college.
