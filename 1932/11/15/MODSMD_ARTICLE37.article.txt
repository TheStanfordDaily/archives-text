## THE 						WAR IS OVER! 
### 
The statement that "the War is
over" is not very startling or par
ticularly revealing. Historians seem
pretty well agreed on that fact. Yet,
actually the World War has not
died. Or to be still more accurate,
it was buried some 14 years ago;
and the worm-eaten corpse is dis
interred once a year—paraded
i around to the tune of oratorical
bombast and military bands —and
reluctantly returned to its tomb.
But this yearly reawakening of
(he terrible spectre on Armistice
Day could be tolerated, if it were
the only time when we are sup
posed to re-frenzy ourselves in a
quasi-hysterical x'eliving of the
War. No—everywhere the unpleas
ant picture of slaughter—must be
called to the attention of our fading
memories.
San Francisco builds a splendid
Opera House. Hundreds of possibili
ties for names. One is selected, "War
Memorial"—so that future inhabit
ants of the Golden City by the
Golden Gate will be sure to get the
thrill of hate every time they re
member that the marble commem
orates the cfays of effective and
prolific extermination legalized by
law and glorified with bands and
baloney. And Los Angeles cannot
be outdone—at least not by San
Francisco. The Olympic Stadium,
scene of the Games this year, has
been renamed the War Memorial
Stadium or some such thing.
Just a few weeks ago there were
countless prattling and rumblings
about the glories and wonders of
international goodwill as exempli

| fied in the Olympic Games. And
j before all that exuberant apple
j sauce had dried in the pan, military
I units parade up and down—the City
Fathers salaam reverently to what
they think is the "veteran" vote, say
the magic words, ar.d we have a
stadium dedicated to scientifically
engendered hate and organized car
nage. j
Armistice Day is supposed to be
time set off to celebrate peace. But
everyone knows that this is mere
phantasy—whimsical and ethereal
to the last ditch. Peace is much too
unexciting a thing to celebrate.
Armistice Day has come to be a
day—if thought of at all—as a com
memoration of the time when WE
showed THEM. It serves to check
the spread of German good-will
through such mediufns as German
aviators, German pretzels (espe
cially when beer comes back), and
German legs (by Marlene).
Pacifists turn their tonsils on army
officers, seeing them as human vul
tures waiting anxiously for the next
war to feed their inhuman lust for
blood and destruction. In reality,
the real danger is the peanut poli
tician who finds it much easier to
work on emotional instability of the
mob than to explain why he has all
of his wife's relatives wallowing in
the public trough.
And of course the menace of the
war profiteer who profits himself
fat; and then generously gives off
some of his financial avoirdupois in
liberally buying juicy tax-exempt
securities for himself and for the
glory of the cause is also present at
all times. •—Abe Mellinkoff
