REPERTOIRE IN GRAND OPERA.
And the San Francisco Season.
Grand opera itself is a combina
tion of several arts: music, acting,
and staging. Consequently a good
opera should be satisfactory not only
fron\ a musical standpoint, but
should also have a well-constructed
plot, an attempt at characterization,
and a dramatic effect rising from
these as well as from the music. It
may have arias and ballets, but
these must not be wholly incom
patible with the situation—as the
Sextette in Lucia. The result of
these demands, which are invariably
ignored, is that there are few operas
which can be considered generally
good.
A good presentation, too, makes
extraordinary demands. It postulates
that the singer be an actor as well—
which would be almost impossible
anyhow, since most operas as writ
ten cannot be acted. The backstage
end of the work must not be ig
nored: the settings and lighting
should be as good as for any stage
play; there is no combination of arts
to interfere with this phase of the
work. Still, the fact that to present
grand opera one must be an artist
in several directions makes good
production a very infrequent oc
currence.
Still there is no excuse for ignor
ing these things. One cannot say
that because opera is a bastard art
it is only necessary to observe one
feature of it. Nor can one argue that
excellence in one phase detracts
from excellence in another. For
example, one is not more likely to
appreciate the singing if the acting
is atrocious. The two arts mutually
support each other, and a deficiency
in one jars upon the spectator so
that he fails to appreciate the other
fully.
Nevertheless, in the San Francisco
season, as in every other American
performance, the music was given

the attention it deserved—for it is
beyond doubt the most important
of these mingled arts—but every
other one was sadly neglected. In
the present condition of operatic
tradition, this cannot be considered
to have interfered with the general
success of the season.
Probably because of the perilous
financial condition, no attempt was
made to introduce a novelty; every
opera was a time-tested favorite. All
were musically excellent, and can
be heard dozens of times with un
diminished enjoyment; still, this
failure to enlarge or enhance the
repertoire soon leads to stagnation.
The stimulus to write operas is as
slight as the opportunities of getting
one, once written, presented. But if

opera companies refuse to look at
newer or less prominent operas,
even if they have achieved success,
opera will soon be as dead as many
consider it now. —Zimansky

these demands, which are invariably
ignored, is that there are few operas
which can be considered generally
good.
A good presentation, too, makes
extraordinary demands. It postulates
that the singer be an actor as well—
which would be almost impossible
anyhow, since most operas as writ
ten cannot be acted. The backstage
end of the work must not be ig
nored: the settings and lighting
should be as good as for any stage
play; there is no combination of arts
to interfere with this phase of the
work. Still, the fact that to present
grand opera one must be an artist
in several directions makes good
production a very infrequent oc
currence.
Still there is no excuse for ignor
ing these things. One cannot say
that because opera is a bastard art
it is only necessary to observe one
feature of it. Nor can one argue that
excellence in one phase detracts
from excellence in another. For
example, one is not more likely to
appreciate the singing if the acting
is atrocious. The two arts mutually
support each other, and a deficiency
in one jars upon the spectator so
that he fails to appreciate the other
fully.
Nevertheless, in the San Francisco
season, as in every other American
performance, the music was given

the attention it deserved—for it is
beyond doubt the most important
of these mingled arts—but every
other one was sadly neglected. In
the present condition of operatic
tradition, this cannot be considered
to have interfered with the general
success of the season.
Probably because of the perilous
financial condition, no attempt was
made to introduce a novelty; every
opera was a time-tested favorite. All
were musically excellent, and can
be heard dozens of times with un
diminished enjoyment; still, this
failure to enlarge or enhance the
repertoire soon leads to stagnation.
The stimulus to write operas is as
slight as the opportunities of getting
one, once written, presented. But if

opera companies refuse to look at
newer or less prominent operas,
even if they have achieved success,
opera will soon be as dead as many
consider it now. —Zimansky

And the San Francisco Season.
Grand opera itself is a combina
tion of several arts: music, acting,
and staging. Consequently a good
opera should be satisfactory not only
fron\ a musical standpoint, but
should also have a well-constructed
plot, an attempt at characterization,
and a dramatic effect rising from
these as well as from the music. It
may have arias and ballets, but
these must not be wholly incom
patible with the situation—as the
Sextette in Lucia. The result of
these demands, which are invariably
ignored, is that there are few operas
which can be considered generally
good.
