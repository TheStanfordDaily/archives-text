### Dick Strouse 
Keeping the turnstile at the Palo !
Alto Hospital busy, four Stanford j
varsity football men trotted out of j
the hospital and one walked wear- !
ily in during yesterday's scrimmaged
with Dr. Fritz Roth*J» well-coached j
flu squad. Caddel is the newest I
casualty, and if any more regulars j
become sick, Roth may substitute j
lor Pop Warner as the head coach: i
he'll have more material.

Warner did hold a dummy scrim
mage yesterday in preparation for
Saturday's Big Game against Cali
fornia, although no rough man ver
sus man blocking and tackling were
part of the program. The team was
in good form, as photographers !
from San Francisco were down to I
take pictures that will illustrate the j
sports pages from today through j
Sunday.
There is considerable inter-team
rivalry going on now for the im- j
portant left guard position. Ted
Kite, the regular until he was in- j
jured, is back in harness but he has]
found that Jack Holwercjn, Paul |
Targhetta, and Phil Johnston have j
been busy during his absence. . i
Guards Look Good
Holwerda, formerly a tackle,
played fine ball against Ihe Cali
fornia Aggies, while Targhetta and
Johnston have looked good in their
various appearances in the lineup.
Bob Maentz, Stan Anderson, Red
Gribben, and Buck Van Dellen
form the quartet that left the hos
pital yesterday.
Warner himself scouted California
Saturday, and was impressed with
the Berkeley power and reserve
strength. Accompanying him were
half a dozen regulars, and only La
borde, Grey, Sim, and Baker of the
first string saw service against the
Calags.
