# Doyle Looms As "Find" Of Card Swimming Team
## 
### 
Coach Norton Thornton today
saw possibilities of having one
capable replacement for Frank
Booth and Austin Clapp of last
year's swimming team, following
the unexpected victory of Walter
Doyle over a fast field in ihe Junior
Pacific Athletic Association 220-
yard swim in San Francisco Sun
day.
Doyle, a transfer last year from
U.C.L.A., was timed in 2:30.G, one
fifth of a second slower than the
P.A.A. record. He defeated Smith
son of California, McKay of Cali
fornia, and the favorite, Buster
Olds, of the Olympic Club. He is
expected to bolster the Cards'
chances by next quarter, when in
tercollegiate meets start. Coach
Thornton predicts that he will swim
the distance in 2:18 before the sea
son closes.
