# NOVEMBER 22 SET AS OPENING DATE OF NOVICE BOXING
## All Bouts But Semi-Finals And Finals Run Off In Gymnasium 
### 
Setting the afternoon of Novem
ber 22 for all fights except the finals
and semi-finals and choosing a com
mittee to have charge of the affair,
the Circle "S" society has completed
plans for its annual novice boxing
tournament.
The large group of men who have
already signed up as well as those
who may still do so will take part
in the preliminary rounds at 4:20
o'clock, November 20. The bouts
will be held in the boxing room in
Encina Gym, and there will be no
admittance charge.
Committee Named
Stuart Hawley, president of
Circle "S," included Yuji Imai, Page
Edwards, Fred Glover, and himself,
and Coaches Harry Maloney, Myron
Schall, and Myron Sjjrague on the
committee. Maloney and Schall,
who coach the varsity mittmen, will
have personal charge of the tourna
ment, while Circle "S" society has
arranged to furnish small, 14-carat
gold boxing gloves as awards.
The popularity of the tournament
has again broken all records, with
6 middleweights signed up. The
heavier weights have not yet proved
so well-liked, as Keith Topping,
Robert Ransome, and Jerry Peters
are the only light-heavies. Not a
heavyweight has entered.
Finals December 1
The final and semi-final fights
will be held on the evening of
Thursday, December 1, in the Pavil
ion. There is a charge for the finals,
as boxing is the only sport other
than football that supports itself at
Stanford.
