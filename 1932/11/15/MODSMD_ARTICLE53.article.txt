# MALONEY SHIFTS SOCCER LINE-UP FOR U.C. GAMES
## 
### 
Faced with the problem of meet
ing California twice in the same
| week, Coach Harry Maloney's "big
i experiment," the 1932 soccer squad,
takes a lay-off today in preparation
i lor the game to be played tomorrow
! afternoon on the campus.
With a month and a half of prac
j tice already behind them, the men
| of the team have not yet been as
| sembled in their permanent line-up.
; Each week, in fact almost every
! day, finds some change being made
; in the composition of the first
! string eleven.
Latest bit of remodeling, coming
as an aftermath of the feeble 1-0
i victory scored over the Bears last
Saturday, is the shift of Al Velarde
! to outside left in Wataro Sutow's
' place, it was the loose play of the
forwards against U.C. that kept the
; Indians from winning by a greater
| margin, and in an effort to reinforce
I the line's scoring punch, Maloney
i contemplates shifting Art Hearn,
j regular center forward, to outside
j right. Cy Johnson, of the hefty boot

| and shaky wind, will therefore
move over to center forward.
With their coach, Buster Holmes,
'and several members of the squad
i doing some vehement sniffling in
the hospital, the freshmen play their
! second game with the Bears tomor
j row also, making the long trek
j across the bay where they will try
j to do something abput last Satur-
J day's unimpressive 4 ie.
Goalie Jack King was the only
! member of the varsity*.squad who
■ came out of the Bear game with'any
j injuries. His slight case of "charley
; horse" should be off the books by
| tomorrow.
In yesterday's scrimmage, after
j the varsity had been unable to score
on the second team, the frosh, with
i Pieper kicking the ball, put one
■ across the varsity thirds. Then the
: second team returned to the field,
and just as the sun got itself well
hidden below the horizon, Dick
Strouse kicked one past the very
I much mystified goalie, "Harpo"
j Marx.
