### 
( Kditok's Not km This is the fifth and lust of a series of articles -written
by Charles ililbert Wrenn U'hich lias been runniiuj in the Daily under the
superi'ision of the Student Committee at Stanford.)

In his final article dealing with |
"Student Problem Aids'' Dr. Wrenn i
has chosen the subject of "Problems
Involved in Planning for a Career."
"There has been pretty definite 1
indication that students succeed
best in college when they have a'
definite vocational objective. When
you know where you are heading, |
you are apt to steer a straighter i
course in the selection of majors and
courses. You are apt also to possess
greater interest in your college I
courses. A study of 140 Engineering'
juniors showed that Engineering
students whose interests were those
of the successful engineer, as meas
ured by the Vocational Interest
Test, had a forty per cent higher
grade-point-ratio in engineering in
terests.
The freshman should start think- ;
ing on the subject and by the end 1
of the year have at least three or 1
less tentative career fields in view.
The sophomore, in order to make |
an intelligent choice of a major, j
should endeavor to know definitely j
at least his general vocational field, j
By no means should this important ,
decision be left to chance or to a 1
forced decision in the last quarter:
of the senior year.
