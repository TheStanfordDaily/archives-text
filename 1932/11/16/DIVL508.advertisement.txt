RADIO?
I Major Howard Angus, former
V. P. of the National Hroadcast
ing Company, says: "Radio offers
a wide scope tor talent—the tech
nique of program production,
merchandising, writing, scientific
research, even financing. To suc
ceed, the young man of today
must have a thorough training,
an alert mind, a clear head."
REWARDS in radio go to the man
with an "alert mind" and a
'clear head." This kind of man, in
•his business as in college, elects the
! pipe his favorite smoke. And any
1 rollegc man can tell you his favorite
! ;moking tobacco—Edgeworth.*
This is only natural — for in all
obaccodom there's no blend like the
;nixture of fine old burleys found in
I Edgeworth. In that difference there's
j lew smoking satisfaction, new smok
! ing comfort. Like to try before you
