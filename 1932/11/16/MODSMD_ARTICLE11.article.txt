# PARADE ON ROW BEFORE RALLY FOR BIG GAME
## Stanford Roughs Will Jam Pavilion To Hear Pep Talks For Game 
### 
Listen to that war cry tonight
down along the Row to the Pavilion
| when old man Big Game Spirit
j clamps his hands in a strangle-hold
j on the Farm for the balance of the
i week.
Chanting the battle cry of the ;
I Rough, the he-men from Sequoia j
will parade up to the Fiji house with J
| their traditional golden bear's cof- j
fin and are scheduled to reach the '
head of the torchlight procession at j
I 7 o'clock.
It's the Big Game rally, though, at i
7:10, which is expected to draw
throngs of visitors to the campus J
today, the majority of whom will be j
unable to get inside of the building j
because of the limited capacity.
Bonfire Later
A.nd it's that Big Game bonfire, j
which the freshmen have finally de- j
cided to finish today, that is going '
: to cause lots of excitement back be
' hind the power house after the last
cheer has sent the Stanford Indians
scurrying out of the basketball pal
ace to watch the Sequoians send j
| their huge coffin up to the heavens '
in the smoke of the bonfire.
Paul Speegle, '29, probably most i
famous of Stanford yell-leaders, will j
be featured as the principal speaker
at tonight's rally. Speagle is known
i for his originality, impromptu hu
mor, and his unusual ability for
fiery, interesting pep talks.
In addition to the Stanford band,
i which will play in uniform both at
the rally and in the parade along
; the Row and between the dormi
tories on the way to the Pavilion, a
male quartet is listed on the evc-
I ning's entertainment.
Drofnats to Appear
At some time during the rally, it |
is not known when, Chief Hot-and-
Cold-Running-Water, who attended
Stanford as Johnny Drofnats, will
appear to tell the audience how the
| situation looks from his observatory â€¢
in the Canadian wilds.
Although there was some doubt
, originally as to the possibility of j
having "Pop" Warner and the var- j
sity squad appear because of the llu |
epidemic, it was announced last i
night that both will be there. War- j
i ner will speak to the warlike In
| dians.
All students will be required to
show student body cards for admis
sion to the Pavilion, and visitors
must produce the official admittance '
cards which may be obtained free !
of charge by Stanford students at i
j the A.S.S.U. office. The maximum ;
! number of non-students who may j
attend is limited to 1,600.
Must Learn Songs
All students, freshmen especially, !
I are urged to learn the principal,
Stanford songs and yells in order |
that they may be used effectively !
! both tonight and at the game in |
Berkeley Saturday. In view of the !
fact that the California rooting sec
tion is much larger than Stanford's,
Cardinal rooters must co-operate in
order to equal the Bears.
"Son of a Gamboleer" and the
Stanford Hymn, in addition to
"Come Join the Band" will be used
Saturday, it was revealed,
