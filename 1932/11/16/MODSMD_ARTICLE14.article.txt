j Fisher, chairman of the Committee j
I on Russian Research, lectured last j
j night in the Little Theatre.
Fisher summarized the four sal
ient ideas of the Communistic labor j
movement as: (1) A revolutionary!
class war, (2) Class war in the daily ;
struggle against capital and the |
state, (3) A social revolution which j
would bring a dictatorship of the j
proletariat, and (4) Complete co-op- !
eration with all communist parties. I
He stated that in 1927 the mem- ,
bership of the Russian Trade Union j
International was 13,862,209. Of this 1
number 10,248,000 were Russians and j
! 2,800,000 Chinese.
As a specific example of the ac- j
tivities of the Russian labor or- '
ganizations, Fisher mentioned the I
"United Front'' tactics which began i
I in 1922. This resulted in a proffered !
j loan of two and a quarter billion
| rubles to aid British strikers in the
| period 1924-25. This offer was re- \
| jected by all the British unionists
I with the exception of the miners, j
| who accepted some financial aid. ,
Fisher traced the development of j
j the present Soviet Union labor or- |
I ganization through the Revolution J
and down to the present period of |
the Five Year Plan. The Five Year 1
i Plan, he stated, was made necessary i
! by the dire need for accumulating
j basic capital with which to carry on
I industrial development.
