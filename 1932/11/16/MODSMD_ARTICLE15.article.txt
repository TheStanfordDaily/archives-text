# Sellout Likely For Bear Game
## 
### 
j Willi only 2500 tickets unsold and I
' three days remaining, a sellout i
' seems assured for the Big Game.
This f( necast was made yesterday j
by the Stanford Board of Athletic J
Control which is handling the Stan- j
ford ticket sale for the Indian
, Gclden Bear gridiron contest this
Sat urday.
It is estimated that approximately
7t>,000 of the ducats have been dis
posed of, only 3,000 less than the ;
Berkeley Stadium's 79,000 capacity.
Of the total sold, 2,424 are Stanford 1
rooter stickets while between 9,000 !
and 10,000 are in the hands of Cali- |
fornia enthusiasts.
According to a statement from j
the B.A.C. last night, not nearly so i
many refunds have been given this j
year as during the last Big Game j
I sale. The number is not expected to |
exceed 1,000 Stanford rebates as |
compared with nearly 6,000 a year j
ago. The principle reason for the de- â€¢
cline is the cancellation of the out- i
of-state ruling which demanded that j
all buyers call for their tickets in
person.
