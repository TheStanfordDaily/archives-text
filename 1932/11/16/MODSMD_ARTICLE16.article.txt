# Genuine Ol' Indian Chief To Be At Rally Tonight
## 
### 
He's coming, lie's coming, he's
coming! He's here, you dope. Ol'
Chief-Hot-and-Cold-Running - Wa
ter.- you bet. And he's here at Stan
ford. He's been away, but he's back
now. He's been hunting in the
Northland but he's not there any
more because he's HERE. AND HE
IS GOING TO BE AT THE RALLY!
Good ol' Chief - Hot - and - Cold-
Running-Water, the pick and pride
of our Indian Warriors (ugh), is go
ing to appear for YOU, gentle read
ers, TONIGHT!
He's been away for a long, long,
real ol' long time, you bet, and
probably only the grads way back in
ought ought will remember him.
But he's back now. Stanford's own
Chief Hot - and-Cold-Running-Wa-

I ter. And believe me, he was sure
an ol' prominent activity man in his
j day. He used to live in the boat
house and go to Roble Jolly-Ups
and everything. It's even been ru-
I mored that he's the only man for
| whom the Union ever cashed a
I check for over $2.
The question is who is he, where
i is he, why is ho, how is he, what
;am I doing? But you needn't look
j for him, YOU DOPE, because you
i won't find him and don't go looking
' under any ash-can lids, because he
â–  won't be there, because he's hiding
'just like ol' Chief Hot-and-Cold-
Running-Water knows how to hide,
you bet! But he'll be atjhe BIG
j GAME RALLY, you dope, TO
i NIGHT!
