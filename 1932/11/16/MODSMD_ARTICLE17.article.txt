Humor, Satire
The Gaieties will feature a wide
j variety of humorous and satirical
j sketches, interspersed with clever
chorus and black-out numbers.
Joseph Wolf, prominent debater,
has penned a hilarious burlesque
on "Death Takes A Holiday," which
jis made perfectly fair by the fact
that Wolf was a member of the cast
! of that play.
"The Candidate" is the title of a
! rousing political satire, which prom
| ises to be far more exciting than its
I unobtrusive title. Men's rushing will
i bear the brunt of lots of jests, when
: a sketch satirizing that time-honored
farce will flash across the stage.
