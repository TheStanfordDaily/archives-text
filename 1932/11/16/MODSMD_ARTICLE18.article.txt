# 'Old Boy' Visits Campus Friday
## 
### 
A fat issue of the Chaparral, the
Big Game Chappie, is to be on sale
Friday on the Quad and will sell at
the Big Game on Saturday.
Chappie humor in this edition
transcends that of all other issues.
Whereas, previous issues have had
some jokes that were a bit. shady
and their points half-hidden, those
in this issue are blossoming out in
color and will be glaringly obvious
in their hues. Don Cameron, editor,
is responsible for this coloring, the
first since two years ago.
The cover and entire issue prom
ises a large circulation and sale be
cause of the external and internal
quality, according to Bob Andersen,
circulation manager. Andersen still
has a few positions open to persons
wishing to sell Chappies at the Big
Game. They get their fare there and
back, five cents commission per
Chappie, and admission into the
game.
