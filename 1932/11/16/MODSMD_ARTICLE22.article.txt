# Haldane Talks On Bad Effect Of Impure Air
## Student Assembly Hears English Scientist 
### 
"The main thing that kills men in
t their work is what they breathe—
j and not accidents." With these open
| ing words Dr. J. B. S. Haldane, Eng
lish scientist, set the keynote for
his lecture yesterday in the Assem
; bly Hall.
Dr. Haldane stated that the "Bad
Air" which causes trouble for avia
tors is air containing too little oxy
gen. "A lack of oxygen causes a
I reaction in humans similar to that
caused by too much alcohol. The
subject has an all powerful feeling
I of ovevconfidence. He will think his
jokes good and all others bad." A
continued scarcity of oxygen will
lead to collapse.
Divers Suffer
The deep sea diver or the worker
i in compressed air tunnels, Professor
! Haldane indicated, suffer from ni-
I trogen dissolved in fatty tissue by
the intense pressure. The only im
mediate danger of this excessive
i pressure is the risk of bursting ear
drums. If the diver is kept in oxy- j
gen for too long a period, there is a 1
chance of contracting pneumonia.
Miners suffer from three types of
1 gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and
j carbon monoxide. Of the first two
I gasses, carbon dioxide replaces the
oxygen near the ground, and me
! thane supplants the air near the top
I of the shaft.
Dr. Haldane told of a boyhood ex
j perience when he was taken down
into a gas-filled mine shaft. His
j father obliged him to stand erect
breathing in the methane gas and
i reciting poetry until he fell down
i exhausted.
Monoxide Dangerous
Carbon monoxide is the most j
dangerous of the mine gases. "After |
lan explosion," Professor Haldane 1
| said, "the carbon monoxide does
I most of the killing. The actual force j
j of the explosion very rarely causes'
i death."
Dr. Haldane closed with a plea I
I that workers in industry be pro- j
j tected against injury from gases and ;
i dust. Study is necessary to deter- j
I mine which dusts are actually dan- !
gerous. In certain cases coal dust is \
actually beneficial, flour is harmless, j
| but. silica is invariably deadly.

i in compressed air tunnels, Professor
! Haldane indicated, suffer from ni-
I trogen dissolved in fatty tissue by
the intense pressure. The only im
mediate danger of this excessive
i pressure is the risk of bursting ear
drums. If the diver is kept in oxy- j
gen for too long a period, there is a 1
chance of contracting pneumonia.
Miners suffer from three types of
1 gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and
j carbon monoxide. Of the first two
I gasses, carbon dioxide replaces the
oxygen near the ground, and me
! thane supplants the air near the top
I of the shaft.
Dr. Haldane told of a boyhood ex
j perience when he was taken down
into a gas-filled mine shaft. His
j father obliged him to stand erect
breathing in the methane gas and
i reciting poetry until he fell down
i exhausted.
Monoxide Dangerous
Carbon monoxide is the most j
dangerous of the mine gases. "After |
lan explosion," Professor Haldane 1
| said, "the carbon monoxide does
I most of the killing. The actual force j
j of the explosion very rarely causes'
i death."
Dr. Haldane closed with a plea I
I that workers in industry be pro- j
j tected against injury from gases and ;
i dust. Study is necessary to deter- j
I mine which dusts are actually dan- !
gerous. In certain cases coal dust is \
actually beneficial, flour is harmless, j
| but. silica is invariably deadly.
"The main thing that kills men in
t their work is what they breathe—
j and not accidents." With these open
| ing words Dr. J. B. S. Haldane, Eng
lish scientist, set the keynote for
his lecture yesterday in the Assem
; bly Hall.
Dr. Haldane stated that the "Bad
Air" which causes trouble for avia
tors is air containing too little oxy
gen. "A lack of oxygen causes a
I reaction in humans similar to that
caused by too much alcohol. The
subject has an all powerful feeling
I of ovevconfidence. He will think his
jokes good and all others bad." A
continued scarcity of oxygen will
lead to collapse.
Divers Suffer
The deep sea diver or the worker

I trogen dissolved in fatty tissue by
the intense pressure. The only im
mediate danger of this excessive
i pressure is the risk of bursting ear
drums. If the diver is kept in oxy- j
gen for too long a period, there is a 1
