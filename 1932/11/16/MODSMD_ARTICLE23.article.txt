# Candidates For Joffre Debate Squad Chosen
## 
### 
Seventeen of the most promising j
members of the Stanford varsity de- !
bate squad were picked last night I
to work for places on the team \
which each year contends with the
i University of California for the
Joffre debate medal.
Those chosen to work toward the !
Joffre contest are the following nine '
seniors: William A. Kaye, Bromley
j Smith, Floyd Benson, Wayne Ban- j
I nister, Leonard Bloom, Mary-
Kalherine Morris, Franklin Gil- j
I christ, Marion Harper, and Joseph
| Wolf; live juniors: Rollin Woodbury,
Ronald Kay, Reginald Partridge,
James Minor, Joseph Fessio; three
j sophomores: Andrew Bright, Bob j
Grantier, and Spencer Thompson. <
The squad will be cut to half size
,at the end of the quarter.
This debate has been held each
year since the founding of Stanford
University, with the University of
I California as the opposing team. The
I subject of the debate is never an
j nounced until two hours before the
debate, but is always on some
; phase of French economic and
political problems. The medal which ,
[goes to the winning team has been;
'held by Stanford seven times in the;
j past ten years, but was lost to the :
Bears last year.
