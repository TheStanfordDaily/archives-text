# Minute Game Pyre Looms As '36 Men Lag In Final Work
## Raids From Golden Bear Camp Fail To Materialize; But Lack Of Combustible Matter And Frosh Indifference Hinder Bonfire Effort 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
j ANLY twelve hours left, untold work is still undone; hut what there is
! of the bonfire is still intact in spite of anticipated raids from (he
i Blue and Gold camp in Berkeley.
That is the situation greeting: the Class of '.'{s as it awakens this morning
for breakfast in Encina Commons. In addition to the recognized depres
sion-caused lack of wood and other fuel, there comes the additional
; threat of the current influenza epidemic on the campus and a positive
interference on the part of many freshmen which combine to throw a

â€¢ good-sized monkey wrench into the
! machinery of construction.

Although boasting the largest
class in recent years, the freshmen
have been extremely lax in their
woi'k, according to those in charge.
With proper allowances made for
those who are ill, or who have been
ill, it is estimated that a constant
crew of at least 50 men should be
out on the field behind the power
house. Though almost 60 frosh
worked Sunday, the number has
steadily dwindled to practically
nothing during the past 48 hours
with an unexpected spurt during
Cit lecture and all-University as
sembly in the morning.
Much Work Yet
With about two days' work yet
to be done in one afternoon, bon
fire leaders are urgently asking that
every freshman who can possibly
do so report to the field during
every spare minute today.
"The bonfire is a freshman enter
prise entirely,'' said Huntington
Kingsbury, Encina Club president,
last night. "Its success or failure
will show what the Class of '36
means to Stanford. Every man ought
to take a real interest in doing his
share."
Improvement Noted
Late yesterday the bonfire was a
little over half filled solidly with
the center draft and the outer sti'uc
ture a good deal higher. Three large
truckloads of packing crates piled
on late yesterday raised it to thus
height. Although this is an improve
ment over 24 hours ago it is still
lower than any day-before-thc-bon
fire level in reccnt years.
According to schedule, construc
tion must ccase by 6:30 o'clock to
night in order that oil may be poured
over the entire pile of debris and
have everything ready for ignition
at 7:45 o'clock as soon as the rally
in the Pavilion is over.
Workers Get Meals
A ladder-like arrangement has
been constructed with two telephone
poles leaned against the structure
so that, if the freshmen respond to
the call for volunteer labor, an end
less chain of workers may be placed
on this and fill the interior of the
framework as l'apidly as the sides
are completed.
Arrangements will be made to
serve meals to those who are kept
at work on construction during the
regular dining periods in Encina
Commons.
