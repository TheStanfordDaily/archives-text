While Stanford went peacefully about its business yes
terday afternoon, building the bonlire, working in labs,
and i>ri|»inover mid-quarter grades, the (Uill-Hulli'tin al
most had Herbert Hoover seated at the President's desk in
the t'niversily Administration lUiilding. Almost but iu>t
quite.
There are naturally a great many conjectures when a
man so much in the public eye as I lie President of the
t oiled States retires from political life. Four years ago
that pesky old lady Dame Humor had Calvin Coolidge
about to embark on various careers from deep-sea fishing
to the diplomatic service. And, of course, Cal returned to
his rural home and dabbled in journalism.
ll is also only natural that Hoover, landsliding out of
the While House in such spectacular fashion, should be
the huh for similar conjecture. Imaginative news sleuths
didn't have to rely on Dame Humor to learn that Hoover
returned to his campus home to cast his ballot in the recent
election. Xor did they lean upon hearsay to get the general
idea that Hoover is a Stanford graduate, that he is a friend
of Hay l.yman Wilbur, and that Wilbur, in addition to his
position as president of the I Diversity, has held a secre
taryship in Hoover's cabinet.
Hut where did the San Francisco gentlemen of fiction
and journalism gel the idea that Hoover is to assume the
presidency of Stanford, with Wilbur resigning in his fa
vor? Hy this time the rumor has been sufficiently spiked,
with Lelainl W. Culler, chairman of the board of trustees,
adding his denial in Ibis morning's Daily. Now if the cor
rection of this latesl error of the (.dU-lUillctin might also
serve as a chastisement wouldn't that be a blessing?
