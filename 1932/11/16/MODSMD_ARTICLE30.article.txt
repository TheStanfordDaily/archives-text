# OH, MR. PHELAN

### 
ll is sad .indeed when someone exaggerates what they
have heard rumored about, but the situation becomes
really tragic when they exaggerate what they have seen. In
a recent statement to the press. Mr. IMielan, who at the last
report was still the coach ol" the Washington Huskies, told
of a group of .'{(H) Stanford men who gathered around the
Washington bus and booed loudly at the football players
as they appeared.
I'ndcr the stress and excitement of arriving in a strange
town, Mr. Jimmy Phelan might be excused from imagin
ing some individual catcalls from a passing high school
student, but when the Husky coach talks of MOO students
booing, the thing passes from the accidental into the mirac
ulous. Any Stanford man could have informed Mr. IMielan,
had he hut asked, that .'{(ld students registered in this I ni
versity could never be prevailed on to gather in one spot
long enough for the mere purpose of viewing ani/ team
arrive anywhere.
The ([notation went on to say that these MOO students
booed "in a manner showing they thought it was the con
ventional thing." Only in very rare instances do Stanford
rooters boo in the stadium, and then only when they feel
that some overt act has been committed. The thought of a
large group of Stanfordites waiting patiently for the ar
rival of a visiting team, and then proceeding to boo "in the
conventional manner" these gentlemen for whom they can
have but the slightest interest, is extremelv comical.
