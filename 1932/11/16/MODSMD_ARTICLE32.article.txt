# BULL SESSION
## SCIENCE ON THE BLOCK 
### 
How to care for your intestinal
j tract, throat, corns, or even falling
i hair has all been settled by science.
Perhaps not by science working in
■ the laboratories; but by science on
| the national networks and in the
newspapers. And after all science in
j the laboratory is relatively un
| known, uninteresting, and uninflu
-1 ential. But science on the radio and
I in the advertisements is giving peo
; pie a justification for doing all the
! things they have been doing for
| years.
During some eras, people were
; crazy over religion, other times they
! are just crazy, and this 20th century
I is surely "hipped" on science. It is
! God, clergy, and church all wrapped
into one; and in some respects is
bettering all of them. One used to
buy "indulgences" from the Church
to justify your sins. Now, one has
them justified by science.
The Church was never quite able
; to completely supplant common
! sense; but common sense is no bar
I to science. If one over-eats and gets
: that TOXIC feeling, there is sure
I to be some Viennese or Afghanistan
! ian specialist with just the cure in
J this week's Saturday Evening Post
j —or wait a week and see the next
| issue. Or if your conscience is stab
! bing you, and yc.u can't get to sleep
! nights, drink Ovaltine or other
; products which are horning into the
j sleep-soundly field of this product.
Gone are the days when a com-
I pany could pour advertising mo
! lasses over the people's eyes and
! expect profits. Now, they pour mo
j lasses over our eyes—but with the
! endorsement of some scientist. In
| fact, if they can buy off enough

scientists (and if their credit is
| good, they usually can), they can
' fairly drown us in the honey and
| molasses of their advertising man
i ager. And we eat it up—never be
j coming nauseated or sickened in the
i least at the horrible spectacle.

It is common knowledge how a
; very popular cigarette company
I bought about 20.000 medical en
dorsements with less cost and effort
J than it would take to get the O.K.
Jof half that number of movie stars.
, We like to smoke the tobacco that
i the STARS smoke. But it surely is
j a great balm to our conscience to
know that SCIENCE itself recom
mends it too. We are clearly aware
j that any tobacco is injurious to a
! certain extent; but out trots the
j denizens of the laboratory with
their gu ffcontradici by ennuendo
j what we know is true. Now, we can
| have the pleasure of nicotine and
j the joy of self-Righteousness in
knowing that tobacco is O.K. The
set-up is perfect. The company reaps
profits.
And science, the heralded emanci
i pator of mankind, has itself been
sold down tha river. It stands, a
; trifle foolish looking, in its regal
! robes of black and gold—chained in
I six different places to the chubby
little figure with the big cigar and
the checkered suit —advertising.
By the sonorous guile of scientific
I tort and retort, the masses have
1 been led to the trough of financial
i exploitation; there, eating, drinking,
I and doing what they will, little
j knowing that the figure they see is
| not a protecting diety but a loose,
lifeless bag—stuffed with business
| blurb. —Abe Mellinkoff
