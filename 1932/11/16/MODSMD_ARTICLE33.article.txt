EIN WALTZER VON STRAUSS—
! At (he Varsity Theatre.

The two things that commend this
! picture are Gustav Froelich's acting
! and a series of waltzes written by
! the Strausses. Were it not for these, i
! the picture would rank far below
j average. The story is badly senti- J
| mental, badly put together, and does I
i not come very near the facts upon 1
I which it is supposed to be based.
I It was meant to be heartbreaking
j when the elder Strauss left his '
I happy home that his genius might '
I be free, when his son's waltzes be- j
1 came more popular than his father's, j
j when the son's sweetheart married j
j a baker so that there might be an
! other untrammeled genius, and |
I

| when the son played ihe Blue Dan
! übe to his dying father. Gustav
|Froelich as the younger Strauss did
; his best with the hopeless part, but
j could not succeed in making it con
vincing. He was further hindered
; by a weak supporting cast, although
the minor characters were well done.
The waltzes, however, atoned for
i the other weaknesses of the film, i
For some reason a German orches- ;
! tra of only a few instruments can I
• play these with more spirit than a !
j full American symphony orchestra, j
The result is music excellently fitted
j for the movies, and of a quality |
: seldom heard. Fortunately the re-j
1 cording was excellent, if the German !
| reputation for fine photography did j
: not display itself. —Zimansky I
