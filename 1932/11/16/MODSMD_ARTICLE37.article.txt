The Editor, Sir:
In an article in yesterday's Stan- j
ford Daily entitled ' Husky Coach
Wages War on Booers, Flays Cards," j
Mr. Phelan expresses himself thus:
"At Palo Alto as the team crawled
out of the busses at the stadium j
about 300 students started to boo |
in a manner showing they thought
ii was the conventional thing." i
I was one of the '"300'' who wit- j
nessed the arrival of the players at ;
the stadium. The other 299 were the
little kids under the age limit who j
were seeking admission to the free \
section. These little kids are Stan-j
ford's most enthusiastic rooters, but I
they haven't the most gentlemanly
attitude. Consequently, the Wash- 1
ington team was booed.
Maybe I wouid have booed too.
but when those "Huskies" started [
to unwind from ordinary looking j
human beings in a bus to giants that ! j
used the clouds of the stratosphere j
for a halo, my mouth hung open in
breathless astonishment. I couldn't j
purse my lips to join in with the |
other 299 kiddies to make the de- j
sired sound.
It seems that Mr. Phelan has lost i
all sense of perspective after coach
ing such giants and now he can't
tell a grammar school kid from a
college student.
"Acorns to you, Jimmy!"
Very truly yours,
Bud Gordon
