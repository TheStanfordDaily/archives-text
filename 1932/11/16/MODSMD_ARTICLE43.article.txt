# Indians Meet U. C. Today in 2nd Soccer Match
## STANFORD VICTORY WILL TAKE SERIES AWAY FROM BEARS Cal Drops First Game 1-0; Maloney Leaves Tonight For A.A.U. Meet 
### Maurice Rapf 
Big Came Week's first taste of
California-Stanford competition will
be served this aftc moon on the cam
pus when the varsity soccer men
tangle with the Bear eleven which
has won only one game to date and
lias already dropped its first tilt to
the Indians, The game starts at 13:!j0
o'clock.
Coach Harry Maloney, who also
acts as A.A'.U. representative, leaves
for the national convention tonight,
and he is anxious to have the squad
win this, the last game that he will
supervise this year. There is an
other encounter .scheduled for Sat
urday on the Berkeley campus, but
a win today can put the series on
ice.
Forwards Promising
Stanford's 1-0 victory over the
Bears in the first games was not
indicative of the relative strength
of the two teams and if the for
wards can gel together in their
passing attack in front of the goal,
the score may be larger today.
An entirely revised forward line
will face California today. Art
Hearn, who ordinarily plays center
forward, will probably play outside
light today, with Cy Johnson oper
ating at center. Carl Knecht, the
made-over left wing, who has proved
the most reliable player on the team
at inside left, will maintain his posi
tion, with Sven Dodington likely to
get thy call at the inside right spot.
Shifts Probable
Maloney will probably do con
siderable shifting during the course
of the game and he has such men
as Emerick, Bojas, Viguie, and
Washburn to call on for these posi
tions. In addition he has A1 Velarde
and Wataro Sutow for outside left,
with Velarde set to get the starting
call.
The backfield, which has played
consistently good ball, remains much
the same with White, Kennedy, and
Spohr, halfbacks, Branch and Brek
elbaum, fullbacks, and Jack King,
goalie.
Frosh Leave Today
Although Coach Buster Holmes,
who is suffering with the flu, will
probably not accompany the team,
his freshman squad will travel to
Berkeley this afternoon to settle the
1932 series with the California year
lings, the first game having ended
in a 1-1 tie.
The tentative line-up consists of
Hansen, outside left, Blanchard, in
side left, Pieper or Gomez, center
forward, Natwick, inside righ.l7Gates,
outside right, Johnstone, left ftalf,
Bansbach. right half, Pieper or
Gomez, center half, Huntsberger and
Martin, fullbacks, and Laird, goalie.
