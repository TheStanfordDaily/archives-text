It is a well-recognized fact that college intercollegiate football is an
amateur sport in which the athletes participate for the love of the game
and the glory of their alma mater. Of course, such products of the game
as newspaper headlines and full-page photographs and eleven-inch letters
made out of old Turkish toweling have crept in to disturb the pure enjoy
ment obtained from football by the players, but they are after all only
products and are realized as such.
Therefore, since football is after all only a game played by men who
love the exercise and fun of it, there is no actual difference between a
first- and second-string player. There is no actual difference, other than
the color of their jerseys, between a Stanford regular and Gray: athletes
of both squads ai'e but examples of red-blooded American youth placing
away its non-lab-infested afternoons.
As punishment, therefore, for their perfect freedom of action, it might
be a good plan to force the Grays to play next year's Big Game against
the California Goofs and thus to give the regulars, burdened down as
they are with obnoxious Saturday afternoon games, at least one week's
freedom. Of course, the publicity of the affair would have to be judiciously
handled to make certain no loss of revenue for either Stanford or
California.
In order to prepare the Grays for their possible forthcoming publicity,
we herewith are publishing a list of the team that defeated the Goofs
this year 13 to 6. It is of course possible that the squad may even enjoy
the publicity—only because of its novelty, of course.
CENTERS: Wes Muller, Gray captain who was recently demoted to
the varsity. Muller was an all-Junior College Conference jtar at Glendale
last year. Chuck Bates, brother of varsity center Bill, who is a promising
sophomore and a wonder on offense^
GUARDS: Bob Black, San Mateo Junior College captain last year
and another all-Conference player, may also be demoted to the varsity
if his playing doesn't fall off. A1 Semmelroth and Johnny Mottram, two
stalwarts of the Class of '35's strong freshman line. Larry Cooke, Gray
regular who has shown perhaps more improvement than any other Gray
this year. Johnny Freeman, Bruce Tarver's freshman running-mate two
years and a good blocker, and Dick Gould, who alternated with Freeman.
TACKLES: Jack Drown, transfer from Long Beach J.C., who started
against the Goofs. Howard Buller, out of school for a quarter or so after
playing center for the 1930 frosh. Marion Mitchell of Bakersfield J.C.
Donn Tatum, line star of 1930 yearlings. Jim Brooks, big and strong.
Milt Keller,' frosh regular last year. Harry Bell, light but good U.C.L.A.
transfer. And White, injured most of the year.
ENDS: Lyle Smith from Bakersfield J.C. —a center last year and
most likely of the ends to make the varsity; Bob Steiner, also much im
proved: Marvie Kahn of the 1931 freshmen; transfer Jack Norwood; Henry
Bcede, high-school star now at Stanford.
QUARTERBACKS: Ed Strong from Piilo Alto, most effective of.the
Gray backs, although light. John Lipscomb, a hard worker who won his
'34 numerals.
HALFBACKS: Travi.? Flippen, regular on the Class of '35's team.
Paul Zaches, who looked so good against the Goofs. Fred Abbott, another
sophomore. Herb Sanderson, a freshman quarterback who has become a
tricky half.
FULLBACK: Charlie Seaver, a golf star who is becoming one in
football. Basil Pocock Kantzer, hard-hitting and experienced (although
he was a lineman until this year) but handicapped by poor eyes.

Paul Zaches, who looked so good against the Goofs. Fred Abbott, another
sophomore. Herb Sanderson, a freshman quarterback who has become a
tricky half.
FULLBACK: Charlie Seaver, a golf star who is becoming one in
football. Basil Pocock Kantzer, hard-hitting and experienced (although
he was a lineman until this year) but handicapped by poor eyes.

It is a well-recognized fact that college intercollegiate football is an
amateur sport in which the athletes participate for the love of the game
and the glory of their alma mater. Of course, such products of the game
as newspaper headlines and full-page photographs and eleven-inch letters
made out of old Turkish toweling have crept in to disturb the pure enjoy
ment obtained from football by the players, but they are after all only
products and are realized as such.
Therefore, since football is after all only a game played by men who
love the exercise and fun of it, there is no actual difference between a
first- and second-string player. There is no actual difference, other than
the color of their jerseys, between a Stanford regular and Gray: athletes
of both squads ai'e but examples of red-blooded American youth placing
away its non-lab-infested afternoons.
As punishment, therefore, for their perfect freedom of action, it might
be a good plan to force the Grays to play next year's Big Game against
the California Goofs and thus to give the regulars, burdened down as
they are with obnoxious Saturday afternoon games, at least one week's
freedom. Of course, the publicity of the affair would have to be judiciously
handled to make certain no loss of revenue for either Stanford or
California.
In order to prepare the Grays for their possible forthcoming publicity,
we herewith are publishing a list of the team that defeated the Goofs
this year 13 to 6. It is of course possible that the squad may even enjoy
the publicity—only because of its novelty, of course.
CENTERS: Wes Muller, Gray captain who was recently demoted to
the varsity. Muller was an all-Junior College Conference jtar at Glendale
last year. Chuck Bates, brother of varsity center Bill, who is a promising
sophomore and a wonder on offense^
GUARDS: Bob Black, San Mateo Junior College captain last year
and another all-Conference player, may also be demoted to the varsity
if his playing doesn't fall off. A1 Semmelroth and Johnny Mottram, two
stalwarts of the Class of '35's strong freshman line. Larry Cooke, Gray
regular who has shown perhaps more improvement than any other Gray
this year. Johnny Freeman, Bruce Tarver's freshman running-mate two
years and a good blocker, and Dick Gould, who alternated with Freeman.
TACKLES: Jack Drown, transfer from Long Beach J.C., who started
against the Goofs. Howard Buller, out of school for a quarter or so after
playing center for the 1930 frosh. Marion Mitchell of Bakersfield J.C.
Donn Tatum, line star of 1930 yearlings. Jim Brooks, big and strong.
Milt Keller,' frosh regular last year. Harry Bell, light but good U.C.L.A.
transfer. And White, injured most of the year.
ENDS: Lyle Smith from Bakersfield J.C. —a center last year and
most likely of the ends to make the varsity; Bob Steiner, also much im
proved: Marvie Kahn of the 1931 freshmen; transfer Jack Norwood; Henry
Bcede, high-school star now at Stanford.
QUARTERBACKS: Ed Strong from Piilo Alto, most effective of.the
Gray backs, although light. John Lipscomb, a hard worker who won his
'34 numerals.
HALFBACKS: Travi.? Flippen, regular on the Class of '35's team.
Paul Zaches, who looked so good against the Goofs. Fred Abbott, another
sophomore. Herb Sanderson, a freshman quarterback who has become a
tricky half.
FULLBACK: Charlie Seaver, a golf star who is becoming one in
football. Basil Pocock Kantzer, hard-hitting and experienced (although
