# CARD POLOMEN TO MEET FAST SAN MATEANS
## Polo Club Squad To Bring Down 9-90 U Lineup; Match Friday 
### Bill Myers 
Polo fans will see one of the fast- j
I est teams on the peninsula in action !
! this Friday when the San Mateo !
Polo Club meets the Stanford riders i
in a six-chukker tilt.
Willie Tevis, Jr., who heads the :
San Mateo outfit, has announced j
that he will bring down an eight- j
or nine-goal team. The exact line- ;
up has not yet been announced, but !
i it is likely to include such stars as i
Jack Bradley, former Yale player, 1
one of the Elizalde brothers, Miguel |
or Angel, and Pat Linfoot. Tevis
himself is one of the outstanding j
players in northern "California and I
is rated f»t five goals.
All of the above men have played
against Stanford at various times i
during the last year, cither for the !
Menlo Circus Club or for San
Mateo. All of the matches have been
won by narrow margins with the
Redshirts getting slightly more than
their share of the wins.
Captain Dick Gordan, Stanford!
coach is dickering for a six-goal
handicap for the Cards. Gordan i
rates this year's team at two goals, j
while last year's outfit was given an i
unofficial handicap of four goals.
The same team that last Friday j
nosed out the Menlo Circus Club, i
7-6, will take the field. This team'
was made up of Luppen, Melone, j
Gillham (capt.), and Myers. These !
men showed exceptional individual j
form in this opening match, but j
general teamwork was rather weak, j
The loss of Rufe Spalding from j
the team made a last-minute change j
in the line-up necessary last week, j
and the players had some trouble j
in getting used to the shift. Gordan j
hopes to have this difficulty partly i
ironed out in time for the San I
Mateo match, and believes that with
the handicap he is asking for that
the Cards have a good chance to j
whip Tevis' gang.

form in this opening match, but j
general teamwork was rather weak, j
The loss of Rufe Spalding from j
the team made a last-minute change j
in the line-up necessary last week, j
and the players had some trouble j
in getting used to the shift. Gordan j
hopes to have this difficulty partly i
ironed out in time for the San I
Mateo match, and believes that with
the handicap he is asking for that
the Cards have a good chance to j
whip Tevis' gang.
