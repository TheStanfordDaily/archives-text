# INGRAM BUILDS GOOD DEFENSE
## Bears Use Six Man Line, 2-2-1 Secondary 
### Bobb Letts 
Congratulations from the losing
coach to the winner in Saturday's
Big Game between California and
Stanford at Berkeley will probably
include some comment about the
merits of the "great defense you
built up for us."
The Bear^ 1 , gradually growing
stronger than Stanford, if latest in
formation is correct, have shown in
dications of having a defensive ag
gregation that might be too much
for the Warner reverses.
Holds Washington
So far this season, most of Navy
Bill Ingram's games have seen the
Blue and Gold eleven using a six
man line, with a 2-2-1 backfield.
Though far from invulnerable, it
has stacked up against the team that
beat Stanford, Washington, and did
much better against Southern Cali
fornia than the score would indi
cate.
Pop Warner has presented several
variations this season, but it is
doubtful that he will use any trick
combinations next Saturday such
as he devised to stop Santa Clara.
The Bears don't shift, so it will be
necessary to have men set in the
line to stop "Hank" Schaldach, Ar
leigh Williams, and the rest of the
ball-carriers.
Indians Outweighed
At this writing things look tough
for the Indians. They will be out
weighed considerably in the line
and will get no better than an even
break in the backfield.
Wnether the much-advertised
passing attacks of both teams will
be able to outwit the opposing de
fenses remains to be seen, but right
now the boys from across the bay
hold the advantageâ€”which may in
crease as Stanford's flu forces grow.
The sea is about six miles deep at
its deepest point.
