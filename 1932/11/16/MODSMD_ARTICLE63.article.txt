# GALLERY SHOWS POTTERY EXHABIT
## 
### 
Modern and antique French pot-
I teries collected in 1928 by Pedro
1 Lemos, director of the Art Gallery
j and Museum, form an interesting
j exhibition in the Gallery.
j The modern potteries were bought
| from pottery works in Southern
| France, but the antiques were ob
j tained by bargaining with peasant
j families. Some of these pieces had
! been used by their owners for gen-
I erations and could only be got in
i exchange for new pieces of the same
I size. And the peasants thought they
| were cheating Lemos.
Burton S. Boundey has on display
I monotypes, charcoals, oils, and water
j colors. The monotypes are prints
I taken from oil paintings, and result
j in only one reproduction from each
picture.
The French education of Adolph
| Berson of Palo Alto shows in his
I exhibition of oil paintings, which
display fine brush technic. The
scenes are principally Parisian but
include some paintings from Cali
fornia.

wood "raft.
