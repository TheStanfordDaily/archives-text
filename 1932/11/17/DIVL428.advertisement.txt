It haunted clerks
for generations
"The first of the month" used to be a time of
feverish activity for ledger clerks. But the Bell
System accounting staff — breaking away from
tradition — simplified the keeping of accounts and
rendering of monthly statements to customers.
They applied a] modern system of rotation bill
ing to the telephone business which now spreads
this work evenly throughout tlie 'month. In co
operation with manufacturers, they devised special
typewriters and bookkeeping machines. Thus
they did away with inefficient rush and achieved
greater accuracy, speed and neatness.
This is but one example of a point of view found
throughout the Bell System. Even long accepted
routine is constantly studied — it's always worth
looking for the more efficient way!
