## California-Stanford Grid Classic Will Feature Air Attacks Versus Sustained Drives; Bears Given Slight Edge Over Card Gridmen 
### DICK RODDA 
IiItATIC vs. erratic!
This will lie the theme of the Big Game football show as the two most ,
inconsistent grid squads on the Pacific Coast meet in the Berkeley Stadium I
Saturday afternoon in the thirty-eighth annual Stanford-California grid
classic. In anticipating such a game we may also look for many scores
by either team, lite Hears accomplishing theirs mostly via air. while the 1
Cards should be seen clicking in two or three of their sustained drives.
Until a month or s» ago the Bears occupied first place as the coast's |
most erratic eleven, but since then the Big Red Machine has outdone the
entire season's record of the Bears in three recent consecutive contests.
In all three, the Trojan, Bruin, <>nd Husky games, the underdogs came !
through against the mis-favored In-<§ j

dians.
Bears Inconsistent
Bill Ingram's outlit indicated that
everything was not going to be so
rosy for the Bears in the sccond
game of 'he season in which the
Santa Ciara Broncos defeated them
for the first time in many years. In
the ensuing weeks the Bears seemed
to do just he unexpected. As un
derdogs they tied the then mighty
St. Mary's Gaels, as favorites they
dropped their opening conference
tilt to Washington State, and again
as underdogs they came through to I
victory against the Washington
Huskies.
But in spite of these obvious
characteristics of the two teams, (
both Pop Warner and Biil Ingram
believe their squads are due for
their best games of the year with
costly errors noticeably lacking. And i
if this will be true, we are not going
to make effort to pick a winner
although at the present time the;
betting odds give the Bears a slight
edge. We can almost assure the
holder of a couple of Big Game j
ducats, however, that he will be!
treated to the best grid exhibition '
this year regardless of whether his j
seats are on the east or west side of
the stadium.
Caddel, Allen Released
Disregarding precedents in Big
Game preparation, Pup Warner has
admitted pass-holders to the prac
tice field every day this week. He
has also abolished the practice of
taking his squad into the hills a
couple of days before the game.
Thus varsity men will attend their
regular classes tomorrow.
Last night the Old Fox held a
dummy scrimmage in which the
opposing eleven used California
plays. Warner gave the boys a
blackboard talk and announced that
no new plays had been given the
(ju; this week. Tonight's practice
will end Big Game preparations.
As Ernie Caddel and Dusty Allen
were released from the hospital to
day, Thornie Rogers, substitute end,
was admitted with a flu attack.
Targhetta is the only other football
man in the hospital.
