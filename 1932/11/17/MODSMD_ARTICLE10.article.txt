### Jay Graves 
John Hurlbut, member of the
i Moot Court board ol the Stanford
J law school, who acted as judge of
1 the moot court case held Tuesday
i evening, has not announced his de
l cision as yet.
i George Crocker, graduate of the
| Stanford School of Law and prac
ticing San Francisco attorney, was
] scheduled to judge the case but was
unable to appear at a late hour,
j Hurlbut acted in his place, and his
i decision will be announced as soon
! as he has had time to go over the
i briefs prepared by the moot lawyers.
Manslaughter Trial
The case involved the question of
whether a misdemeanor resulting in
I a killing without contributory neg
| ligence, would be sufficient grounds
j for a manslaughter trial. A gun
carried in the pocket of a car ex
ploded when the car burned, killing
a fireman. The driver of the car did
I not have a license for the gun.
James Robb and Leon Carley, at
j torneys for the defense, contended
i that it was a mere malum prohibi
- turn, a wrong only because it was
prohibited by statute, to carry the
| gun, and that it was not sufficient
j to sustain conviction. They declared
j that there was no negligence to
I raise the offense to manslaughter,
; and that it was not the intent of the
| legislature to abolish the distinction
I between acts wrong in themselves
i and wrong merely by statute.
Argue for Statutes
Wadieh Shibley and George Var
gas, for the State, asserted that not
the common law but the statutory
law holds in the case at bar and
there is nothing to indicate that the
legislature didn't mean any unlaw
ful act. The danger to human life
necessitates the breaking away
from the common law attitude, they
contended.
