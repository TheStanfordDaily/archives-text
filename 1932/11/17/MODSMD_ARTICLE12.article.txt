# Last Curtain Rung On Famed Axe Melodrama
## 
### SHERIDAN HEGLAND 
The last chapter in a melodrama
was written yesterday.
In 1896 Will Irwin, '99, got an idea
for an axe yell, and the Roughs
liked it.
After the Big Game of 1899 some
Stanford students decided to get an
axe, found one in the corporation
yard, dubbed it the "Stanford Axe,"
painted a block "S" on its 10-pound
15-inch blade, and donated it to the
University.
Eirst Rally
Six hundred students met in the
first Axe Rally Thursday, April 13,
1899, sharpened it on a grindstone,
gave yells, promised themselves
they'd beat California Saturday,
April 15. They took the Axe with
them to the b.ill park at Sixteenth
and Folsom streets, San Francisco,

watchcd California win 9-7, went
home. Four days later the Daily
Palo Alto said the Axe had been
stolen. It gave no details.
| California spelled the Axe with
out an "e," kept it in a bank vault,
! took it out once a year for an Ax
Rally, used an armored car. Had
the frosh class guard it, and kept it
■ 31 years.
I A Stanford man once carried, it
from a rally to the bank but couldn't
get away. Another Stanford man
once carried it on horseback at the
head of a procession but couldn't
! get away. Once a California girl
saved the Ax by hiding it under
her skirt.
