## Warner And Corbus Speak; Chief Running Water Featured Guest 
### Stan Beaubaire 
It wus Paul Speegle last night in
the Pavilion who made the Bii?
Game rally what a real Big Game
rally should be.
It was P-iul Speegle, famed Stan
ford yell leader of 1929, almost
brought down the house when he
led approximately 4,000 raving In
dians in a riotous version of the
"New Spell."
Wise-cracking his way through
minutes as rapidly as ordinary sec
onds, Speegle kept his audience on
edge as he tol dthe throng what the
real Stanford spirit meant, in a
more serious mood, ho stated that
residents of the Bay Region looked
down on Stanford has having prac
tically no school enthusiasm at all,
and begged that the Stanford root
ers do their utmost on Saturday to
deny this theory.
Rooters Do Help
He added that, in spite of the
common ballyhoo that a team on
the field pays no attention to its
rooting section, a we!-, organized
group of rooters do a lot toward
giving the squad a feeling of con
fidence against the opposition.
Stanford's grand old" "Fox," Coach
"Pop" Warner, declared that "Stan
ford will have reason to be proud
of her boys Saturday." He admitted
that, although he himself was not
at all proud of the varsity's per
formance against the Bruins or the
Huskies, he was very pleased with
their action in the Trojan contest.,
and expected to be very proud of
his team in the California game.
Corbus Speaks
Bill Corbus, student body presi
dent, told the Stanford roughs, In
dian maids, and visitors who jam
med tue Pavilion that Stanford's
chances for victory were very good
and that "although pretty bad after
the game last year, they won't feel
ai all that way this time."
The torchlight parade from the
Fiji house to the Pavilion last night
was one of the most successful
Stanford has witnessed, according
to observers. Flares lit up the road
throughout the path of march., and
the band played in uniform for the
long procession of marchers and
crowded automobiles.
Chief Arrives
Although Chief Hot-and-Cold-
Running-Water reached the floor in
time to greet the crowd, he was
not there long enough to get ac
quainted. Ho rushed in with some
animal skins and a bear skin,
trophies of recent hunting trips, and
ran off to the wilds to watch the
California Bear oe scalped by the
local Stanford Indians.
The Big Game bonfire, contrary
to expectations, was a l'eal tribute
to a few members of the" Class of
'36 and their upperelass advisors
for presenting a good-sized pyre
around which Stanford rooters
could follow the band in serpentine.
Rooters were led through more yells
and songs, and with the reminder
from Paul Speegle to follow the
yell leaders carefully Saturday, went
back to do the next four days'
studying tonight and tomorrow
morning.
