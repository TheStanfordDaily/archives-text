A flashy, brilliant, multi-colorcd
football cover will grace the Big
Game Chappie, which goes on sale
for the Stanford campus tomorrow.
This issue, because of the abundance
of jokes and cartoons about the Big
Game within Ihe covers, is a fat
one. Depression did not affect the
Chappie's quality or size, but it did
make it necessary to abolish the in
ternal coloring planned by Don
Cameron, the editor—Old Man of
the campus.
The unique picture displayed on
the exterior is the product of the
clever Jim Algar, campus illustrator,
based upon an idea furnished by
Bob Churchill.
Chappies will be sold around and
in the U.C. stadium at the Big Game
Saturday.
