# STANFORD OFFERS AXE AS BIG GAME TROPHY STARTING IN 1933
## Corbus To Put Question Up To Berkeley Today Plan Proposed by Daily Receives Official Okeh of Ex Committee, Acting President Swain, and Faculty Athletic Committee 
### BILL COLE 
II AVING outlived its usefulness as a symbol of the (lying "'Hate Cal"
spirit, (lie Stanford Axe will come out of its bank vault in as an
annual trophy to the winner of the Big Game after the final whistle.of
the 1933 classic.
This proposal will be formally made today to the student body of the
University of California by Bill Corbus, representing the Executive Com
mittee and the Associated Students of Stanford.
The Ex Committee first voted its approval of the plan at a special
meeting last Thursday, not specifying whether the award was to be in
s stituted after the game this year

! or next.
Swain's Reasons
For this reason it was nut defi
| nitely decided upon until this week
j after Acting-President Robert E.
Swain had placed his approval on
! the general plan with ihe rccom
i mendation that the award not be
| made until 1933 for the following
jreasons:
1. On account of the absence of
President Robert Sproul of the Uni
| verSity of California on an Eastern
trip official approval from that uni
versity cannot be obtained. (Through
i the Daily Californian, however, the
, student body has agreed heartily to
I the plan.)
2. There must be sufficient time
j for a joint committee from the two
! universities to work out the details
of presentation.
3. As the Stanford Axe is today,
it is not a beautiful object and has
i no handle. Polish, a specially de
: signed handle, silver gilt, and a
| mounting must be worked out.
4. Since the Axe has become an
institution, its presentation must be
! handled with dignity. The symbol of
j Stanford's supremacy in football
| over the university across the bay
I since 1899, it is desirable that the
; first ceremonies should take place
jin the Stanford Stadium on the
Farm from which the Axe started
on its colorful career.
Daily Initiative
After Dr. Swain had placed nis
stamp of approval on the sugges
tion, the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee yesterday okehed the plan.
In an editorial on November 2 the
Daily proposed the plan of making
the Axe a permanent trophy to be
presented each year to the winner
i of the Big Game. Although this was
not an entirely new idea, it was the
first time that it had been brought
up this year. Three days later the
1 Rally Committee went on record as
favoring the move, and with that it
became a serious project.
