# Stanford Radio Club Plans To Hold Aerial Card Game
## 
### 
Stanford "and Columbia universi
ties vs. Chicago University and
' Georgia Tech in a contract, bridge
i match, played by means of short
wave radio communication, is the
i plan of the Stanford Radio Club and
t the Old Roblo Bridge Club, an or-
I ganization of Sequoia Hall contract
players.
Members of the local radio club
believe that contract play via the
' air line is entirely feasible, as each
of the four colleges, which have
been tentatively selected, have
short-wave radio stations of suffi
i cicnt power to insure easy com
munication.
