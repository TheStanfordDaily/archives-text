# A 						STANFORD PRODUCT

### 
Last year over .T>() Slanford students spent approxi
mately 700 hospital days in the Rest Homes founded hv
the Mothers' Club, Hv comparing these figures with those
of the lirst year when only .'U students were taken care of,
it is easy to see how big a need the Rest Homes have been
able to meet.
Letters have just been sent out to all the mothers of
Slanford students in the annual appeal for funds. Because
of the general lack of funds on the part of the students
(KM) dollars more were paid last year out of the running
account in order to pay for their board, than was the case
in any previous year. In order that the Rest Homes may be
run as successfully as usual, a greater outside contribution
will have to be collected this year.
This year marks the fourth that the Stanford Rest
Homes have been in operation. During the present flu
epidemic, and at all other times in the past, students have
been accorded nothing but courtesy and consideration by
the ladies in charge. A true home-like atmosphere is main
tained so that real quiet and rest is available to the con
valescing.
Ranked in importance with the Stanford Convalescent
Home, the Rest Homes are one hundred per cent the
product of the Farm. Here is a tradition that we want to
maintain!
