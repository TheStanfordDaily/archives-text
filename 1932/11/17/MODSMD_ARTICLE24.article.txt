# BULL SESSION
## KICKING THE PAIL 
### 
Recently, there was a race on top |
of the Empire State Building. The
winner, 50 years old, executed a 1
flying jump over the railing and:
dropped to a most gruesome eter- ;
nity some floors below. An em- j
ployee of the building ran after him
but missed. More recently, two
smart detectives foiled the attempt j
i of an unemployed nurse to end ali i
in what would have been a startling
leap from the roof of a San Fran
cisco hotel.
People generally applaud the de- ,
tectives and are sorry the Empire j
State employee was unable to j
j the man before he .splattered to his |
death. In fact, suicide is made a !
crime. Those attempting it are al
ways foiled if at all possible. If |
some poor soul takes poison, cannot :
conceal his groans—he is immedi
ately rushed to a hospital. There,
his stomach is attached to a pump, j
Every device of science is used to
save him from self-inflicted death.
| , j
We loathe the very idea of sui- j
side. We scorn the man as a coward .
—for shirking his responsibilities I
, and failing to keep his head up, chin |
in, lip firm, back straight, eyes clear, i
and hair parted on the left side in
the midst of his adversity. If the i
: police officers happen to hear of a I
man who is making plans for a !
jump into eternity, they jump into
their cars, turn on the sirens, break
into the man's room, and stop the
deed at all costs.
Tf I Were king, there would br
s'jiiiiJo parlors maintained at gov
ernment expense for pli those that
defined to pai. 1 * on to whatever one
glasses in to Tno.se contemplating

! jumping from tall buildings, eating
! gopher poison, slashing their jugu
! lar vein, or kindred activities would
: be invited to the place. There they
; would be given an Epicurean repast
j with a bottle of wine (we do not
I sincerely contemplate regal author
ity until after the repeal of prohibi
j tion).
After they had eaten their fill, a
doctor would be presented who
would be given authority to ex
j tinguish the would-be sucide in
any way the patient saw fit. After
j the meal, if he wished to stay and
i think it over fdr awhile, cottages
I would be provided for a reasonable
! time. The patient would be given
i his choice as to whether or not his
j death were to be with or without
i benefit of publicity agents and pho
tographers. The lure of suicide
i would be ended. No slinking and
| shirking in dark alleys waiting for
' a chance. Everything clean and
' open—legal and accepted.
Society takes the attitude that it
I is being swindled every time some-
I one disposes of himself. Of course
j the state loses nothing. The value
of anyone with the suicide-complex
is negligible, and a few thousand
i such are nothing in 120,000,000. And
I further, even if the state were being
! embezzled every time a lead pellet
passed through some human skull,
is not the embezzler justified?
If one feel; sn |,iw' that he >s
willing to give up medium-well
j done filet mignon, "Aliie in Won-
I derland," maplo-rut ruifait, Tschai
kowsky, and Navfu/bt'T fui' moons,
that should be his puny right.

Recently, there was a race on top |
of the Empire State Building. The
winner, 50 years old, executed a 1
flying jump over the railing and:
dropped to a most gruesome eter- ;
nity some floors below. An em- j
ployee of the building ran after him
but missed. More recently, two
smart detectives foiled the attempt j
i of an unemployed nurse to end ali i
in what would have been a startling
leap from the roof of a San Fran
cisco hotel.
People generally applaud the de- ,
tectives and are sorry the Empire j
State employee was unable to j
j the man before he .splattered to his |
death. In fact, suicide is made a !
crime. Those attempting it are al
ways foiled if at all possible. If |
some poor soul takes poison, cannot :
conceal his groans—he is immedi
ately rushed to a hospital. There,
his stomach is attached to a pump, j
Every device of science is used to
save him from self-inflicted death.

We loathe the very idea of sui- j
side. We scorn the man as a coward .
—for shirking his responsibilities I
, and failing to keep his head up, chin |
in, lip firm, back straight, eyes clear, i
and hair parted on the left side in
the midst of his adversity. If the i

man who is making plans for a !
jump into eternity, they jump into
their cars, turn on the sirens, break
into the man's room, and stop the
deed at all costs.
