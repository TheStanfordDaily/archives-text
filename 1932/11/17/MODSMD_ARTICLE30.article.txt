# SONGS WITHOUT SENSE

### BY OLD DR. ALGAR 
News item: No less an authority |
than Arthur M. Hyde of the United I
States Department of Agriculture has
just ruled that under certain condi
tions spinach may be "beautiful."
Of all the words which ears of
men
Have dreaded worse than "count
of ten."
Are those which all fond mothers
yen
To pop, at mealtimes, 'gain and
'gain—
"Finich your spinach!"
Throughout our years we all are
faced,
When through our meal we've
bravely raced
To get at things more to our
taste,
With three short words by
which we're "aced."
"Finich your spinach!"
Now, mothers fond can cite with
pride
j Authoritative "quotes" of Hyde.
Because of him, revolt inside
And help us offer him this
guide—
"Finich your spinach!"
