# Bears Hold Ragged Indian Soccermen To Scoreless Tie
## STANFORD SHOWS MORE POWER BUT LACKING IN PUNCH Failure To Seize Scoring Chance Keeps Victory From Cards 
### Bob Wade 
Two complete teams of Stanford I
Indian .soccer players battled their j
way up and down the Stanford field [
yesterday for 88 minutes against the I
Golden Bears from Berkeley, and j
then called it a day when it was. too
dark to see the ball. Score: 0-0.
The Cardinal elven, obviously the
more powerful team, played ragged
and uninspired soccer save for oc
casional moments near the end of j
the contest when the Indians found !
themselves still scoreless, after i
three quarters of running around
more or less at random.
Last Conference Game
The battle marked the close of
the California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference schedule for 193?, and
left Stanford, the defending cham
pion, in third place behind San
Francisco University and San Ma
teo. The Cards finished with three
victories, two defeats, and a trio of
tie games.
The last game of the season,
against California next Saturday at
Berkeley, will serve merely to de
cide the annual championship be
tween the two schools.
Stanford IMuH's Chances
Stanford had numerous chances |
to score yesterday, but always j
something happened to nullify a |
clear shot, either good work on the
part of the Bear goalie or poor
shooting on Stanford's part.
The first half of the game was
spent almost entirely on the Indians'
side of the center line, but in the j
final half the Cards woke up to j
some exient and began peppering j
the Blue and Gold goal with j
astounding regularity, and amaz- 1<
ingly slight success.
California was evidently still 1
smarting from the 1-0 beating which
they helped Stanford hand out last
Saturday by kicking the only score j
of the game into their own net. |,
