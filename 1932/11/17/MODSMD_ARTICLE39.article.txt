California threatens the Cards
Saturday with a backfield that con
tains what they claim to be three
triple-threat men. Ihe season has
pretty definitely revealed this boast
to be the truth, and it looks as
though the Cards are going up
against a backfield that demands i
respect and consideration. Appar- |
ently at no time during the con
test will California be without a
better than average punter, and a
better than average passer and a j
formidable ball packer. Such a j
combination gives promise that the i
Indian line will have no Roman :
holiday in Saturday's contest.
<e> <♦•' ■♦>
It has been a noticeable defect on ,
the Indian sqUad that nearly every
opponent for the Big Red Machine j
has surpassed it in running back j
punts. Lack of skill in this respect!
has always placed the Indians under
a considerable disadvantage, and it |
is pretty certain that such inequali- |
ties in playing will determine pretty
largely which team will carry off
the laurels of victory Saturday.
Campbell is slated to play the!

safety position, but he alone will be
unable to accomplish a great deal.
It is up to the halfbacks and the
fullback to take out the Bear ends
as they have never been taken out
of a play before. Aggressive block
-1 ing alone will insure Campbell the
i opportunity to some fancy returning
| of California punts.
The Big Red Machine has shown
great power and has executed some
of the most consistent and powerful
j drives seen in Pacific Coast foot
j ball this season. Yet it always seems
! that these plunges into the oppos-
I ing territory come only in the face
i of almost certain defeat. The critical
! time in the game Saturday will be
I at the crack of the opening gun. II
I at this time the Stanford eleven
i shows the same drive that it ex
; hibited in the Washington and
! U.C.L.A. games, and keeps going
j without giving the Bears a chant ;
I to breathe it is pretty certain that
j Stanford will, come off victorious.
This is a large order for a light
j team, but only by filling this order
! can the Indians better the Bears in
11932. —Dick Rodda

Indian line will have no Roman :
holiday in Saturday's contest.

It has been a noticeable defect on ,
the Indian sqUad that nearly every
opponent for the Big Red Machine j
has surpassed it in running back j
punts. Lack of skill in this respect!
has always placed the Indians under
a considerable disadvantage, and it |
is pretty certain that such inequali- |
ties in playing will determine pretty
largely which team will carry off
the laurels of victory Saturday.
Campbell is slated to play the!

safety position, but he alone will be
unable to accomplish a great deal.
It is up to the halfbacks and the
fullback to take out the Bear ends
as they have never been taken out
of a play before. Aggressive block
-1 ing alone will insure Campbell the
i opportunity to some fancy returning
| of California punts.
The Big Red Machine has shown
great power and has executed some
of the most consistent and powerful
j drives seen in Pacific Coast foot
j ball this season. Yet it always seems
! that these plunges into the oppos-
I ing territory come only in the face
i of almost certain defeat. The critical
! time in the game Saturday will be
I at the crack of the opening gun. II
I at this time the Stanford eleven
i shows the same drive that it ex
; hibited in the Washington and
! U.C.L.A. games, and keeps going
j without giving the Bears a chant ;
I to breathe it is pretty certain that
j Stanford will, come off victorious.
This is a large order for a light
j team, but only by filling this order
! can the Indians better the Bears in
11932. —Dick Rodda
California threatens the Cards
Saturday with a backfield that con
tains what they claim to be three
triple-threat men. Ihe season has
pretty definitely revealed this boast
to be the truth, and it looks as
though the Cards are going up
against a backfield that demands i
respect and consideration. Appar- |
ently at no time during the con
test will California be without a
better than average punter, and a
better than average passer and a j
formidable ball packer. Such a j
combination gives promise that the i
Indian line will have no Roman :
holiday in Saturday's contest.
