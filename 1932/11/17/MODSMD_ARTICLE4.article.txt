This is the first of a series of dis

will be the feature of sessions of
the Palo Alto Town Meetings this
winter, every other Thursday night
at the Community House. A com
prehensive program has been ar

''The idea of a Town Meeting is
to bring before the public questions
affecting the country at the present
time, particularly those dealing with
Unemployment and the avoidance of
depressions in the future. It is
hoped that the undertaking will be
of real value in the formation of
public opinion," declared Judge
Ralston today.
Professor Guido Hugo Marx, of
the mechanical engineering depart
