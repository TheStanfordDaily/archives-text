# GAME TO BE FEATURED BY MANPOWER VS. STRATEGY
## 
### BOB LETTS 
Man power vs. strategy. Coach
| Bill Ingram's California footballers
l using the former and Glenn Scobey
j Warner's Stanfordites attempting to
assert the superiority of mind over
matter. Such is the setup for Sat
urday's Big Game at Berkeley.
The reports of numerous scouts
from here who have watched the
i Bears this year indicate that War
| ner's attempt to outguess the
j Berkeley team will have to rely on
! high-powered signal calling if Stan
' ford turns what now appears to be
j an unstoppable tide.
Reverses Spinners
Just exactly what the Old Fox
, intends to spring is still a matter
; of guesswork to outsiders. He has
j closed the practice field gates and
I what little news leaks out discloses
j little that the fan could not imagine.
J Apparently, there will be few new
[ tricks pulled out of his famous bag,
j most of the time having been spent
| so far in polishing the plays on
which the Cards have drilled all
season. Typical Warner football—
reverses, spinners, and laterals —
will probably comprise the attack,
but the ability of the signal-caller
to select proper .plays adds much
uncertainty to the game.
j If things break evenly during the
I early part of the contest, the In
! dians will have a good chance to
j win. If circumstances keep , them
i in a hole and allow California to
pile up any kind of a lead, it will
be a different story.
Weak Pass Defense
From what has been brought back
from Berkeley, it appears that the
Bears' greatest defensive weakness
lies in stopping forward passes, one
of the most potent weapons in the
Indians' quiver. California and Bill
i Ingram know Warner plays—but
I Ihey can't ordinarily foresee them
j because of the great variety of at-
I tacks that can evolve from the same
| formation.
Navy Bill has discarded the shift
he instituted early this season, and
| now the men line up, dig in their
j toes, and charge. It is a less fa-
I tiguing method, but is also less stra
j tegic.
Wing-back Formation
In the last few games, California
| has stuck rigidly to its single
! wing- back formation, with either
l or both ends split, and an unbal
anced line. Based on power, the
system worked well, defeating

Washington, the team that beat
Stanford.
A halfback (either Schaldach or
Williams) and the fullback line up
; side by side about four yards back
iof the center. Two yai'ds back of
i the strong-side guard is the quar
• terback. The ether halfback is lo
j cated a yard back of the line, be
tween the strong-side end and the
'tackle.
Card Defense
From this formation, it is possible
|to get some variety, but most of
j California's running plays feature
! strong interference and gain most
j ground either inside or outside of
i tackle. It is possible, of course, to
| set the formation with the strong
.side on either the left or the right
of the center.
Stanford's defense, providing the
j seven-man line is used, will place
! the brunt of the work on the
1 guards—Bill Corbus and probably
i Ted Kite. Both are light, and
| whether they can weather the con-
I stant pounding of California's two
! tough tackles, Captain Dick Tozer
j and Johnny Ransome, is unknown,
j In addition, they will have to with
stand punishment handed oceasion
j ally by Dave Meek and Jim Mc~
! Cormick, a couple of leather-skinned
j ends.

Weak Pass Defense
From what has been brought back
from Berkeley, it appears that the
Bears' greatest defensive weakness
lies in stopping forward passes, one
of the most potent weapons in the
Indians' quiver. California and Bill
i Ingram know Warner plays—but
I Ihey can't ordinarily foresee them
j because of the great variety of at-
I tacks that can evolve from the same
| formation.
Navy Bill has discarded the shift
he instituted early this season, and
| now the men line up, dig in their
j toes, and charge. It is a less fa-
I tiguing method, but is also less stra
j tegic.
Wing-back Formation
In the last few games, California
| has stuck rigidly to its single
! wing- back formation, with either
l or both ends split, and an unbal
anced line. Based on power, the
system worked well, defeating

Washington, the team that beat
Stanford.
A halfback (either Schaldach or
