j president and all-coast guard, a
person called the Daily Californian

! the Daily Californian, was: "This is
Bill Corbus at Stanford. I wish to

' California has acquired lately. And
i we will consider any attempt to ig
nite our Big Game bonfire before

Rickets, senior men's representative
j at-large, expressed the opinion that
"it shows a narrow and feeble out
look on the part of Stanford." Rick
