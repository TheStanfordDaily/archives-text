'"The time has come, the walrus |
said,
To talk of many things,—"
And then Lewis Carroll's walrus
goes on to discuss such irrelevant
matters as ships and shoes and seal
j ing wax. But the members of the
I Stanford Walrus Club, who have
named themselves after this famous
animal because they, too, like to
"talk of many things," finish the
ditty with:
"Of votes and blocks and farm
relief,
Of bonuses and rings."
1 Not many dormitory bull sessions
turn into clubs to discuss economic
and labor problems, but that is how
the Walrus Club originated some
six years ago. A group of Sequoia
students organized under Professor
Hotelling, then of the economics de
partment, and Dr. J. M. Luck, and
proceeded to hold informal conver
sational style meetings to which
they invited outstanding liberal
; leaders. Among the famous people
! which the Walrus Club has brought
j to the campus in the last few years
I are Anita Whitney, A. J. Musty,
Harry Laidler, and Paul Blanchard.
I The latest project of the club is the
! discussion of the recent election
being held in the Little Theatre to
night.
Membership in the club is open
to everyone interested in discussing
economic, political, and labor prob
! lems, and plans for the coming year
! are to be announced at the oper
j meeting this evening.
