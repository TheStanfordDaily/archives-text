# Blue-Gold Confidence Suffers Letdown As Ingram Luck Wanes
## Early-Season Hopes for Another Successful Year Lax As Injuries Take Heavy Toll; First, Second Strings Hit; Schaldach Gets Lay-Offs 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
By ALBERT GUERARD

The University of California football (cam has been a disappointment
>o Blue and Gold supporters this fall, since every early-season indication
pointed to another successful season for the same Bear eleven that in
19.11 defeated Stanford, and held the mighty Trojans to a single touch
down.
Bill Ingram's success in his first year at Berkeley was so phenomenal
lhat many people considered the present reaction inevitable. Injuries
have taken a heavy toll from Ingram's first and second string material,
focusing unwonted attentions on "Hard Luck" Henry Schaldach, the

spark plug of the Bear offense. <
California opened her season \yith
a double-header against Cal Aggies
and the West Coast Navy. Both
games were won, but in unimpres- 1
sive fashion. The following week
the Bears were badly outclassed by
Clipper Smith's Santa Clara eleven, j
losing 12-0.
Olympic Club held the Bears to a j
(i-G tie until the last quarter of their
game on the next week-end, but a ;
whirlwind attack in the closing min
utes of play gave California a 22-6 |
victory.
Tie St. Mary's
Ingram's men played their best;
game of the season against St. j
Mary's, holding the Moragans to a j
12-12 tie. It was California's best,
performance, and marked the first j
check in St. Mary's fight for cham
pionship honors.
Two close battles with Washington i
teams followed. California lost to 1
Washington State 7-2, defeated Uni- i
versity of Washington 7-6. Both of ,
these games were hard-fought, nip- i
and-tuck battles.
Nevada Bows 38-0
Nevada fell 38-0 in the annual
"breather" before the U.S.C. game, j
but even this much rest whs not I
enough for the Bears. The Trojans
took everything that California had,
in the way of football talent and de
termination, and came on to win
easily by a 27-7 score.
California's last game before the
Big Game was a conference tussle
with Idaho which went to the Bears 1
21-6.
There has been no cut-and-dried j
first string lineup at Berkeley this
year—there have been too many in- i
juries for Ingram to organize his j
men so thoroughly.
Bertoli Out
Ingram had planned on using the j
great '"Chili" Bertoli, former Berke- I
ley High star, as his regular quar- j
terback, but Bertoli has suffered one
injury complication after another, j
He will not play Saturday.
Bertoli is not the only man that
Ingram expected to occupy a first j
string berth, who will watch ihe )
game from the sidelines. Califor- i
nia's veteran ends, Kaufmann, Wa- j
terbury, Degnan, and Sublett were
counted on to protect the Bear I
flanks, but Jones and Carol Gill will j
start Saturday. Sublett was one of
the best players on the near-cham- i
pionship eleven of 1931, but was cut
off the squad early this year.
Tackles Outclassed
Dick Tozir and Johnny Ransome [
nearly earned All-Coast tackle hon
ors last year, but this fall they have ;
been outclassed by St. Mary's Jor
genson and Gilbert, Southern Cali- >
fornia's Smith and Brown, and j
Washington's Ted Isaacson. They j
will do well to hold their own i
against Stanford's Here Laborde and j
George Grey.
Many of the veteran backs at In- j
gram's disposal have had o give up |
places in favor of new men who j
have come to the front this year. I
Foremost among these are Phil j
Klein, Arleigh Williams, and Milo 1
Quisling.
