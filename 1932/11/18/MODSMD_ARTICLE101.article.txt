of competitive athletics. Thus far
the intramural program has been

them the intramural championship
and the silver trophy.
Although Charles Nimmo, frosh
miler, won the cross-country race,
three men, Wright, Carley and Mires
running for El Toro were among the
first twelve to cross the finish line,
giving their club the team honors.
