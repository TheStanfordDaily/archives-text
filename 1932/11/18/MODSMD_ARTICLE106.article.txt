# EASTERN ELEVENS BATTLE TO PLAY ROSE BOWL GAME
## Brown, Colgate, Pitt Are Strong Contenders 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 17 (/P)—South
ern California's football eleven if
called upon to defend its undefeated
record in the intersectional classic
at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, New
Year's Day likely will draw its chal
lenge from one of three eastern
teams —Brown, Colgate or Pitts
burgh.
Two of them, Brown and Colgate,
battle it out on Thanksgiving at
Providence to insure at least partial
elimination.
Pitt Anxious For Tilt
Pittsburgh, conqueror of Army
and Notre Dame in two of the year's
most spectacular battles, should be
especially anxious for another trip
to the Rose Bowl, especially if there
is a chance to square accounts with
S.C. The Trojans, in 1930, handed
the Panthers a 47 to 14 shellacking.
Four years ago Pittsburgh lost to
Stanford by a single point in the
New Year's classic.
Carnegie Tech and Stanford re
main in the path of the Pittsburgh
powerhouse. In its previous career,
the team has suffered two setbacks
though it still has a spotless record.
Both the Nebraska Cornhuskers and
Ohio Slate have held the Pitt outfit
to a scoreless lie. These ties will
gladly be overlooked if they by the
Rose Bowl overcome the remainder
of their opposition.
Colgate Record Good
An impressive victory over the
Warner boys on next Saturday
would not only be sweet music for
Dr. John B. Southerland, the Pitt
coach and a Warner pupil, but would
furnish a natural setup for a return
battle between the Panthers and the
Trojans at Pasadena.
Colgate is so far the only major
college eleven neither tied, defeated
nor scored on. The "Red Raiders"
will be entitled to strong Rose Bowl
consideration if they dispose of the
Brown jinx.
Southern Teams Strong
The South which sent the last two
bama and Tulane, again may pro
challengers to the Rose Bowl in Ala
duce an outstanding contender. Au
burn is as yet undefeated and un
tied and Tennessee has suffered but
one set back, a scoreless tie with
Vanderbilt. Neither of these teams
played a schedule calculated to
build the team into a Rose Bowl
contender.

build the team into a Rose Bowl
contender.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17 (/P)—South
ern California's football eleven if
called upon to defend its undefeated
record in the intersectional classic
at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, New
Year's Day likely will draw its chal
lenge from one of three eastern
teams —Brown, Colgate or Pitts
burgh.
Two of them, Brown and Colgate,
battle it out on Thanksgiving at
Providence to insure at least partial
elimination.
Pitt Anxious For Tilt
Pittsburgh, conqueror of Army
and Notre Dame in two of the year's
most spectacular battles, should be
especially anxious for another trip
to the Rose Bowl, especially if there
is a chance to square accounts with
S.C. The Trojans, in 1930, handed
the Panthers a 47 to 14 shellacking.
Four years ago Pittsburgh lost to
Stanford by a single point in the
New Year's classic.
Carnegie Tech and Stanford re
main in the path of the Pittsburgh
powerhouse. In its previous career,
the team has suffered two setbacks
though it still has a spotless record.
Both the Nebraska Cornhuskers and
Ohio Slate have held the Pitt outfit
to a scoreless lie. These ties will
gladly be overlooked if they by the
Rose Bowl overcome the remainder
of their opposition.
Colgate Record Good
An impressive victory over the
Warner boys on next Saturday
would not only be sweet music for
Dr. John B. Southerland, the Pitt
coach and a Warner pupil, but would
furnish a natural setup for a return
battle between the Panthers and the
Trojans at Pasadena.
Colgate is so far the only major
college eleven neither tied, defeated
nor scored on. The "Red Raiders"
will be entitled to strong Rose Bowl
consideration if they dispose of the
Brown jinx.
Southern Teams Strong
The South which sent the last two
bama and Tulane, again may pro
challengers to the Rose Bowl in Ala
duce an outstanding contender. Au
burn is as yet undefeated and un
tied and Tennessee has suffered but
one set back, a scoreless tie with
Vanderbilt. Neither of these teams
played a schedule calculated to
build the team into a Rose Bowl
contender.
