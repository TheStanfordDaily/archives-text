# Thirty-Four Paintings On California Big "C" Found
## 
### 
Thirty-four times California's Big
"C" has been subjected to the in
dignity of a painting by alien hands.
In the same manner that a fores
ter discovers the age of a tree, the
exact number of successive decora
tions received by the U.C. symbol
has been determined.
The forester counts rings; on the
"C" it was necessary to count coats.
Half an inch of alternating colors,
the result of 34 raids on the emblem
in 26 years, was chipped off by two
student investigators at the Berkeley
campus.
Geological knowledge entered into
the compilation of the different col
ors. Red predominates in the strata,
there being 31 coats of the Cardinal
color. Blue, blamed on St. Mary's
students, is represented by one lay
er, while green, attributed to the
Oregon Aggies, appears twice in the
early layers of pigment.
