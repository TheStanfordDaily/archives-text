BERKELEY, Calif., Nov. 17 â€”
Influenza, which has been sending a
steady string of Stanford University
football players to the hospital dur
ing the past week, struck the ranks
of the University of California team
last night.
Milo Quisling, hard-hitting full
back, was the man ordered to bed.
He is not seriously ill and probably
will be able to see action in Satur
day's "Big Game," doctors said.
"Red" Christie, regular center, was
not in uniform at yesterday's prac
tice. He is nursing a bad cold.
Coach Bill Ingram, in the mean
time is sending his squad through
daily workouts, stressing defense
against the tricky Stanford reverses
and pass plays.
