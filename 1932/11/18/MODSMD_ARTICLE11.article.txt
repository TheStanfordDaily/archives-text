# CARD WIN TOMORROW WILL TIE BEARS IN COAST RACE
## Indians Have 6 Wins, 3 Losses On Record Now California Eleven Holds Single Tie as Only Score Edge; Both Teams Suffered Recent Defeats; Each Has Played Four Conference Contests 
### JACK DROWN 
Stanford varsity football team —six wins, three losses.
California varsity gridiron eleven—six wins, three losses, and one tie.
Such are the season records to date of the Indian and the Golden Bear as
they await the referee's starting whistle in tomorrow's pigskin classic.
Both California and Stanford have played four conference games. The
Golden Bears have won two and t'cd two, while the Cardinals have a con
ference standing of one victory and three defeats. Thus if the Warnerites
win tomorrow they will go into a tie with the men of Ingram in the Con-

ference race, each team having won
two and lost three of its Conference
games.
Cards Fly at Start
Opening this season with a 0-0
win over the Olympic Club in a non
conference affair, the Indians were
off to a flying start. This contest was
played on the 17th of September and
was followed 1 a week later by an
other non-conference victory over
the San Francisco University team
by a 20-7 score.
Then on the first of October, Pop
Warner took his boys North to the
peaceful town of Portland, Oregon.
There the Cards celebrated their first
conference game by staging a field
day and running up a 27-0 score
over Oregon State, which happens to
be the worst beating the Northern
ers have taken all season.
Beat Santa Clara
Not content with the damage they
had done, the Indians came prancing
home and on successive week-ends
defeated the Santa Clara Broncos 14
to 0 anu pasted the West Coast Army
by a 26-0 score. The Stanford re
serves played the Army game in or
der to give the first stringers a much
needed rest in preparation for the
Southern California battle on Octo
ber 22. However, in spite of the
rest cure, Coach Howard Jones
brought his undefeated Trojans to
Palo Alto and they presented an
aerial barrage which gave them a
hard-fought 13-0 victory. Then came
the disaster at Los Angeles on the
following Saturday in which the
U.C.L.A. Bruins blocked too many
Cardinal punts and walked off with
a 13 to 6 win after having been out
gained two to one by the Stanford
team.
Too much Johnny Cherberg was
one of the main reasons for the In
dians dropping their first contest to
the Washington Huskies in six years
the Saturday following the Bruin
nightmare. This young gentleman
tucked one of Stan Anderson's long
punts to his manly bosom early in
the second quarter raced
through the entire Cardinal team for
a beautiful 88-yard run and a touch
down. Although the Stanford eleven
tallied 13 points in this game, the
Huskies piled up 18 and thus took
away an 18-13 victory at the expense
of the Cardinal and White.

Last Saturday the Stanford re
serves rolled up the biggest score
made by a Coast Conference team
this year in defeating the Cal. Aggies
59-0. AfTlerbaugh was the star of the
day making all kinds of long runs
and scoring four touchdowns.
Coach Bill Ingram's California
team opened its season on the 17th
of September by defeating the Cal.
Aggies 20-6, and continued the good
work later in the day winning over
the West Coast Navy by a 13 to 0
count. A 12-0 reversal at the hands
of Santa Clara stunned the Bears for
a while but they came back fighting
mad the next week to trounce the
Olympic Club 22-6. On the Bth of
October, the Berkeley boys played a
thrilling 12-12 tie with a strong St.
Mary's team and the next week were
upset by Washington State, 7-2. Then
came a close 7-6 victory over the
Washington Huskies followed the
next. Saturday by a 38-0 landslide
over the University of Nevada. In
gram took his men South two weeks
ago and they came home on the
short end of a 27-7 score after stag
ing a strenuous battle with U.S.C.
Schaldach, Williams Star
Through the fine ball packing of
Hank Schaldach and Arleigh Wil
liams, the Bears managed to defeat
(he Idaho Vandals 21-6 last Saturday
in the Berkeley Stadium. Calland s
men put up a game fight, but the
California team was too powerful for
them.
Ingram believes that the teams will
be ready to "shoot the works" to
morrow when they line up on the
Memorial Stadium turf in Berkeley,
and that the situation will be pro
ductive of the best football either
team will play this season.
This year's "Big Game" will be
the 38th football game played by the
teams of the rival institutions since
1892, and represents the oldest col -
legiate rivalry on the Pacific Coast.

Last Saturday the Stanford re

this year in defeating the Cal. Aggies
59-0. AfTlerbaugh was the star of the

Coach Bill Ingram's California
team opened its season on the 17th

Aggies 20-6, and continued the good

the West Coast Navy by a 13 to 0

of Santa Clara stunned the Bears for
a while but they came back fighting
mad the next week to trounce the
Olympic Club 22-6. On the Bth of

Through the fine ball packing of
Hank Schaldach and Arleigh Wil
liams, the Bears managed to defeat
(he Idaho Vandals 21-6 last Saturday
in the Berkeley Stadium. Calland s
men put up a game fight, but the
California team was too powerful for
them.
Ingram believes that the teams will
be ready to "shoot the works" to
morrow when they line up on the
Memorial Stadium turf in Berkeley,
and that the situation will be pro
ductive of the best football either
team will play this season.
This year's "Big Game" will be
the 38th football game played by the
teams of the rival institutions since
1892, and represents the oldest col -
legiate rivalry on the Pacific Coast.
Stanford varsity football team —six wins, three losses.
California varsity gridiron eleven—six wins, three losses, and one tie.
Such are the season records to date of the Indian and the Golden Bear as
they await the referee's starting whistle in tomorrow's pigskin classic.
Both California and Stanford have played four conference games. The
Golden Bears have won two and t'cd two, while the Cardinals have a con
ference standing of one victory and three defeats. Thus if the Warnerites
win tomorrow they will go into a tie with the men of Ingram in the Con-

ference race, each team having won
two and lost three of its Conference
games.
Cards Fly at Start
Opening this season with a 0-0
win over the Olympic Club in a non
conference affair, the Indians were
off to a flying start. This contest was
played on the 17th of September and
was followed 1 a week later by an
other non-conference victory over
the San Francisco University team
by a 20-7 score.
Then on the first of October, Pop
Warner took his boys North to the
peaceful town of Portland, Oregon.
There the Cards celebrated their first
conference game by staging a field
day and running up a 27-0 score
over Oregon State, which happens to
be the worst beating the Northern
ers have taken all season.
Beat Santa Clara
Not content with the damage they
had done, the Indians came prancing
home and on successive week-ends
defeated the Santa Clara Broncos 14
to 0 anu pasted the West Coast Army
by a 26-0 score. The Stanford re
serves played the Army game in or
der to give the first stringers a much
needed rest in preparation for the
Southern California battle on Octo
ber 22. However, in spite of the
rest cure, Coach Howard Jones
brought his undefeated Trojans to
Palo Alto and they presented an
aerial barrage which gave them a
hard-fought 13-0 victory. Then came
the disaster at Los Angeles on the
following Saturday in which the
U.C.L.A. Bruins blocked too many
Cardinal punts and walked off with
a 13 to 6 win after having been out
gained two to one by the Stanford
team.
Too much Johnny Cherberg was
one of the main reasons for the In
dians dropping their first contest to
the Washington Huskies in six years
the Saturday following the Bruin
nightmare. This young gentleman
tucked one of Stan Anderson's long
punts to his manly bosom early in
the second quarter raced
through the entire Cardinal team for
a beautiful 88-yard run and a touch
down. Although the Stanford eleven
tallied 13 points in this game, the

Schaldach, Williams Star
Through the fine ball packing of
Hank Schaldach and Arleigh Wil
liams, the Bears managed to defeat
(he Idaho Vandals 21-6 last Saturday
in the Berkeley Stadium. Calland s
men put up a game fight, but the
California team was too powerful for
them.
Ingram believes that the teams will
be ready to "shoot the works" to
morrow when they line up on the
Memorial Stadium turf in Berkeley,
and that the situation will be pro
ductive of the best football either
team will play this season.
This year's "Big Game" will be
the 38th football game played by the
teams of the rival institutions since
1892, and represents the oldest col -
legiate rivalry on the Pacific Coast.
Southern California battle on Octo
ber 22. However, in spite of the
rest cure, Coach Howard Jones
brought his undefeated Trojans to
Palo Alto and they presented an
aerial barrage which gave them a
hard-fought 13-0 victory. Then came
the disaster at Los Angeles on the
following Saturday in which the
U.C.L.A. Bruins blocked too many
Cardinal punts and walked off with
a 13 to 6 win after having been out
gained two to one by the Stanford
team.
Too much Johnny Cherberg was
one of the main reasons for the In
dians dropping their first contest to
the Washington Huskies in six years
the Saturday following the Bruin
nightmare. This young gentleman
tucked one of Stan Anderson's long
punts to his manly bosom early in
the second quarter raced
through the entire Cardinal team for
a beautiful 88-yard run and a touch
down. Although the Stanford eleven
tallied 13 points in this game, the
Huskies piled up 18 and thus took
away an 18-13 victory at the expense
of the Cardinal and White.
Reserves Lead
Last Saturday the Stanford re
serves rolled up the biggest score

team opened its season on the 17th
of September by defeating the Cal.
Aggies 20-6, and continued the good
work later in the day winning over
the West Coast Navy by a 13 to 0
count. A 12-0 reversal at the hands
of Santa Clara stunned the Bears for
a while but they came back fighting
mad the next week to trounce the
Olympic Club 22-6. On the Bth of
October, the Berkeley boys played a
thrilling 12-12 tie with a strong St.
Mary's team and the next week were
upset by Washington State, 7-2. Then
came a close 7-6 victory over the

Stanford varsity football team —six wins, three losses.
California varsity gridiron eleven—six wins, three losses, and one tie.
Such are the season records to date of the Indian and the Golden Bear as
they await the referee's starting whistle in tomorrow's pigskin classic.
Both California and Stanford have played four conference games. The
Golden Bears have won two and t'cd two, while the Cardinals have a con
ference standing of one victory and three defeats. Thus if the Warnerites
win tomorrow they will go into a tie with the men of Ingram in the Con-

ference race, each team having won
two and lost three of its Conference
games.
Cards Fly at Start
Opening this season with a 0-0
win over the Olympic Club in a non

off to a flying start. This contest was
played on the 17th of September and
was followed 1 a week later by an
other non-conference victory over
the San Francisco University team
by a 20-7 score.
Then on the first of October, Pop
Warner took his boys North to the
peaceful town of Portland, Oregon.
There the Cards celebrated their first
conference game by staging a field
day and running up a 27-0 score
over Oregon State, which happens to
be the worst beating the Northern
ers have taken all season.
Beat Santa Clara
Not content with the damage they
had done, the Indians came prancing
home and on successive week-ends
defeated the Santa Clara Broncos 14
to 0 anu pasted the West Coast Army
by a 26-0 score. The Stanford re
serves played the Army game in or

needed rest in preparation for the
Southern California battle on Octo
