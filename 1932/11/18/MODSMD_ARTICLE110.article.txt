# THORNHILL ALWAYS FOUND GRID SPORT MAIN ATTRACTION
## Mentor Made All-American Under "Pop" At Pitt 
### 
From the time that he first en
tered college until the present,
"Tiny" Thornhill has found football
his main attraction. He has played
as an amateur, as a professional, and
has coached.
At Pittsburgh under "Pop" War
ner in 1916, "Tiny" was an All-
Ameiican tackle. Warner claims
that it was the greatest team that
he has produced, and many other
football master-minds contend that
it was the greatest team that ever
played together.
Upon graduating from Pittsburgh,
Thornhill coached the line at Centre
College under Coach Moran. Centre
is still remembered for the wonder
teams that it turned out about that
time.
For the next four years Thornhill
played professional football. He was
a tackle on the Massilo, Ohio, team
for the first two years and acted as
playing manager on the Cleveland
team for the following two years.
The latter position was much the
same as that Ernie Nevers had with
the Chicago Cardinals.
In 1.922 he came to Stanford to
coach the line. Since then he has
had charge of the training of the
Card linesmen and has played an
important part in the developing of
the line stars who have shined for
Stanford in the last ten years.
