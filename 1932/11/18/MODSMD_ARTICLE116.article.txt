# HOOP MENTOR HAS COLORFUL RECORD AS COACH, PLAYER
## Bunn Won Varsity Letters In Three Sports 
### 
John W. Bunn who is starting his !
third season as basketball coach for j
the Cardinal's, has led an active and j
interesting life during his four years !
of collegiate competition and his ■
eleven years as coach and teacher, |
afterwards.
At the University of Kansas, i
where Bunn was a student from!
1918 to 1921, he held the unique dis- j
tinction of being one of the few j
athletes ever to win four varsity I
letters in football in a conference j
that limited competition to three. It ;
so happened that due to the war,
the freshman rule was waived in the
fall of 1918, and as Bunn was good
enough for the varsity, he made the
team. Besides these four letters in
football, Bunn earned three letters
each in basketball and baseball.
After graduating from Kansas, in j
1921, Bunn was offered an instruc- j
torship in Industrial Engineering, ;> j
subject in which he had majored, j
Besides accepting the position Bunn i
agreed to help with several of the ;
coaching jobs and from that time i
until leaving Kansas in 1930, he i
worked and coached in every de- |
partment from swimming to foot- j
ball. In 1926 Bunn resigned from '
the Engineering Department (he was
then an associate professor) to be
come Assistant Director of Athletics I
and also head baseball coach. Be- j
sides these positions, Bunn also was
backfield coach of the football squad, '

and assistant head coach of the
basketball team.
After leaving Kansas, in 1930,
Bunn came to Stanford where he
became head coach of the basket
ball team, and assistant coach of the
l'rosh football team.
While a student at Kansas, Bunn
was drilled under the different foot
ball systems of the country, and as
a result is a well grounded judge
of football tactics. Because of this
fact, he has scouted many of the
Stanford opponents this year. Larry
Mullins of Notre Dame, A1 Kippon
of Michigan, and Potsy Clark of
Illinois were all friends of Bunn
and taught him many of the secrets
of their coaches, Rockne, Yost,

1918 to 1921, he held the unique dis- j
tinction of being one of the few j
athletes ever to win four varsity I
letters in football in a conference j
that limited competition to three. It ;
so happened that due to the war,
the freshman rule was waived in the
fall of 1918, and as Bunn was good
enough for the varsity, he made the
team. Besides these four letters in
football, Bunn earned three letters
each in basketball and baseball.
After graduating from Kansas, in j
1921, Bunn was offered an instruc- j
torship in Industrial Engineering, ;> j
subject in which he had majored, j
Besides accepting the position Bunn i
agreed to help with several of the ;
coaching jobs and from that time i
until leaving Kansas in 1930, he i
worked and coached in every de- |
partment from swimming to foot- j
ball. In 1926 Bunn resigned from '
the Engineering Department (he was
then an associate professor) to be
come Assistant Director of Athletics I
and also head baseball coach. Be- j
sides these positions, Bunn also was
backfield coach of the football squad, '

and assistant head coach of the
basketball team.
After leaving Kansas, in 1930,
Bunn came to Stanford where he
became head coach of the basket
ball team, and assistant coach of the
l'rosh football team.
While a student at Kansas, Bunn
was drilled under the different foot
ball systems of the country, and as
a result is a well grounded judge
of football tactics. Because of this
fact, he has scouted many of the
Stanford opponents this year. Larry
Mullins of Notre Dame, A1 Kippon
of Michigan, and Potsy Clark of
Illinois were all friends of Bunn
and taught him many of the secrets
of their coaches, Rockne, Yost,
