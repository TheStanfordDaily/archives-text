UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 17.—C1 assed the rankest in
and-outers in California football
history, members of the 1932 Cali
fornia varsity will wind up their
conference season tomorrow against
Stanford hoping and praying with
;• 11 their might for one of their "in"
days.
The Bears have been in the "po
tential" class all season, looking like
champions at times but just as

joften looking like
a high - school
j team with their
fumbling, poor
judgment, and
j lack of punch at
| crucial moments.
Whether they will
snap out of the
lethargy they
I seemed to be in
i against Idaho last
week, or not, re
mains to be seen.
Bill Ingram's at
tack places all the
worry on one man

—his left halfback.
Vicing for ihe post all season have
been Arleigh Williams, sophomore,
and Hank Schaldach, playing his
third year for Ihe Bears. Just before
the U.S.C. game, which California
lost by a 27-7 count, it looked like
Williams had robbed Schaldach of
his two-year monopoly on Ihe job.
But Schaldach started, and it was
Schaldach that provided all the fire- I
works, with the exception of Lee
Valianos, kingpin of Ingram's so
called "second team."
Last week, against Idaho, t Williams
fumbled repeatedly, and has been
unable to ' hold onto the ball in j
practice since then, while Schaldach !
has run wild. So it looks like it will j
be "Hard-Luck Hank," the man
who beat Stanford in 1931, that gets \
the call tomorrow.
Back field Named
The Schaldach-Williams dispute
is the only real question as far as
the backfield is concerned, though.
Provided none of them break a leg, j
Gus Castro, Milo Quisling, and Jim ;
Keefer will start tomorrow after
noon. I
A sturdy, stubborn forward wall i
will not be the least of Ingram's !
assets in the Bear-Card tilt. Lloyd
Filler and Jim McCormick, big
ends, work well together, with Mc- !
Cormick's pass-snagging ability be
ing capitalized upon more and more
since he wrought havoc against the
Trojans. Captain Dick Tozer and
Johnny Ransome, tackles, are the
most capable pair of men in the
line, and should handle well what
ever comes their way, while Art
Carlson and Sam Gill, guards, bol
ster up the center of the line.
Christie Rated High
"Red Christie, sophomore full
back turned center, deserves a
paragraph to himself. He is rated
the fastest improving pivot man on
the coast—defensively (where he
plays a fullback position) and of
fensively both.
And that's how California looks
on paper. How it will look along
about the third quarter tomorrow
afternoon, no one can tell, not even
'Brick Morse—and he's been pre
dicting Big Game scores for nearly :
forty years. j ■
