WELL. AFTER BEING MORE or |
less in hibernation for some days j
past, we're back with a few more j
boots for our dear public to chew on. ;
As we have been threatening all I
season, we are not going to pick ihe I
Big Game winner, but we will give I
you a few pointers on how the boys
who should know pick them.
Down at Exposition Park, our lit
tle Trojan pals are for the Cards to j
the tune of 4 to 3!!!!!!!
While up in Seattle, some of the '
other boys who trounced the Indians 1
in an off moment, pick Stanford to ]
win by a count of 5 to 2.
Now, my little friends, remember |
that each member of the fourteen |
votes represented from the two !
schools has either played or coached ;
against Stanford and California this i
year. And furthermore, let us tell :
you something that you may not j
have read in somebody else's paper j
—3,t both universities, the tackles j
have voted unanimously for ihe !
Farm toilers.
In view of the fact that Stanford '
tackles are supposed to be weak, 1
how to figure that one, Watson?
Well, off hand, we should say that 1

! the Old Fox might have devised a
I system whereby the Cards give op
posing tackles a tough afternoon.
Maybe Warner DOES give the ball
I carrier a little interference!!!!!
AND WHILE you arc out there
i tomorrow, Watson, see if you can
' figure out why California's thrusts
around the heavy side fails to click
j as Ingram thinks it is going to!

WE AREN'T SURE WHERE IT
1 came from, but they tell us that
' there is a rumor that Stanford will
I open John Public's eye when the
] team trots out on the field.
| Wonder if they are going to have
i any new jersies, or anything, or
l something or ... .
It would sure be great if . . . oh,

WELL. AFTER BEING MORE or |
less in hibernation for some days j
past, we're back with a few more j
boots for our dear public to chew on. ;
As we have been threatening all I
season, we are not going to pick ihe I
Big Game winner, but we will give I
you a few pointers on how the boys
who should know pick them.
Down at Exposition Park, our lit
tle Trojan pals are for the Cards to j
the tune of 4 to 3!!!!!!!
While up in Seattle, some of the '
other boys who trounced the Indians 1
in an off moment, pick Stanford to ]
win by a count of 5 to 2.
Now, my little friends, remember |
that each member of the fourteen |
votes represented from the two !
schools has either played or coached ;
against Stanford and California this i
year. And furthermore, let us tell :
you something that you may not j
have read in somebody else's paper j
—3,t both universities, the tackles j
have voted unanimously for ihe !
Farm toilers.
In view of the fact that Stanford '
tackles are supposed to be weak, 1
how to figure that one, Watson?
Well, off hand, we should say that 1

! the Old Fox might have devised a
I system whereby the Cards give op
posing tackles a tough afternoon.
Maybe Warner DOES give the ball
I carrier a little interference!!!!!
AND WHILE you arc out there
i tomorrow, Watson, see if you can
' figure out why California's thrusts
around the heavy side fails to click
j as Ingram thinks it is going to!

WE AREN'T SURE WHERE IT
1 came from, but they tell us that
' there is a rumor that Stanford will
I open John Public's eye when the
] team trots out on the field.
| Wonder if they are going to have
i any new jersies, or anything, or
l something or ... .
It would sure be great if . . . oh,
| well, let's wait and see what goes on.

less than eleven sophomores to turn
the Cardinal machine into Bear fod

His so-called first team has four
of them, maybe five, and his second
team, which is stronger offensively
than the first, has seven most cf the
