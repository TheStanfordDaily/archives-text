# ELLINGTON PUTS THIRTY FRESHMAN SPIKE ARTISTS THROUGH PRE-SEASON WORKOUTS
## 
### 
With a squad of approximately j
thirty men reporting, Coach Bill El- j
lington's frosh track team is work- I
ing out daily on the Stanford oval
and rapidly rounding into pre-sea
son form. As there are no meets
until sometime next March, there
will probably be many more candi- j
dates report before schedule gets ;
under way.
Al the present time Coach Elling- j
ton has not worked with the squad j
long enough to get a very good line [
on his men, but several fine pros- |
pects have already been uncovered, i
Standing out in the mile run is
Charley Nimmo, who recently won
the intramural cross country cham
pionship. Nimmo comes from Holly
wood High where he is credited with j
a 4:30 mile. Coming from Palo /. lto i
High is Don Albertson, high jumper j
de luxe, who has already cleared,
5 feet 10 inches.
Kingsbury in Hurdles
Now that Huntington Kingsbury !
of frosh football promience has re- |

i
ported the hurdle events should be ]
well taken care of. While in high !
school, Kingbury ran the 120-yard j
high sticks in the remarkable time '
of 14:9 seconds. In the middle dis- I
tance events Atkinson seems to be !
showing the most promise so far, al- I
though the disqualification of Joe j
Burris was a severe blow to the !
strength in these races. Burris is!
credited with a mark of two min- \
utes flat in the half mile and is also j
a fine quarter miler. However, Joe !
attended Junior College one semes- j
ter, thus making him ineligible to j
compete as a frosh. There is a pos- !
sibility that Johnny Reisner, one of i
the fastest backs on the undefeated |
yearling football team, will report i
for the quarter mile. If he should, ,
this one lap race will be greatly !
strengthened, as the young speedster '
has a prep school record of fifty :
seconds flat.
Pole Vault Artists
Two well-built fellows who an
swer to the names of Jonas and Ginn j
are out to care for the pule vault in '

a big way. The former claims a high
school record of 12 feet 6 inches,
while the latter has already done 11
feet.
The weight department seems to
be well fortified with Bob Reynolds,
Tom Hudson, and Gil Holloway toss
ing (he shot and discus about the
premises. Holloway has twirled the
Grecian platter 130 feet in practice,
while Hudson has been heaving the
16-pound steel ball about 38 feet.
Klopstock in the broad jump con
cludes the list of outstanding pros- '
pccts. A record of 20 feet is already
claimed by the young gentleman
and he has a fine chance of improv
ing his mark.
Sprints Weak
Coach Ellington expects to be bet
ter able to determine the strgerth
oi his squad alter a few more weeks
of practice and also after more can
didates have reported.
At the present time the squad is
very weak in the sprints and javelin
throw, but these weaknesses are ex
pected to be remedied by ihe time
the season starts next March.

a fine quarter miler. However, Joe !
attended Junior College one semes- j
ter, thus making him ineligible to j
compete as a frosh. There is a pos- !
sibility that Johnny Reisner, one of i
the fastest backs on the undefeated |
yearling football team, will report i
for the quarter mile. If he should, ,
this one lap race will be greatly !
strengthened, as the young speedster '

Pole Vault Artists
Two well-built fellows who an
swer to the names of Jonas and Ginn j
are out to care for the pule vault in '

a big way. The former claims a high
school record of 12 feet 6 inches,
while the latter has already done 11
feet.
The weight department seems to
be well fortified with Bob Reynolds,
Tom Hudson, and Gil Holloway toss
ing (he shot and discus about the
premises. Holloway has twirled the
Grecian platter 130 feet in practice,
while Hudson has been heaving the
16-pound steel ball about 38 feet.
Klopstock in the broad jump con
cludes the list of outstanding pros- '
pccts. A record of 20 feet is already
claimed by the young gentleman
and he has a fine chance of improv
ing his mark.
Sprints Weak
Coach Ellington expects to be bet
ter able to determine the strgerth
oi his squad alter a few more weeks
of practice and also after more can
didates have reported.
At the present time the squad is
very weak in the sprints and javelin
throw, but these weaknesses are ex
pected to be remedied by ihe time
the season starts next March.
New York's famous Broadway j
was once an Indian trail.
With a squad of approximately j
thirty men reporting, Coach Bill El- j
lington's frosh track team is work- I
ing out daily on the Stanford oval
and rapidly rounding into pre-sea
son form. As there are no meets
until sometime next March, there
will probably be many more candi- j
dates report before schedule gets ;
under way.
Al the present time Coach Elling- j
ton has not worked with the squad j
long enough to get a very good line [
on his men, but several fine pros- |
pects have already been uncovered, i
Standing out in the mile run is
Charley Nimmo, who recently won
the intramural cross country cham
pionship. Nimmo comes from Holly
wood High where he is credited with j
a 4:30 mile. Coming from Palo /. lto i
High is Don Albertson, high jumper j
de luxe, who has already cleared,
5 feet 10 inches.
Kingsbury in Hurdles
Now that Huntington Kingsbury !
of frosh football promience has re- |

i
ported the hurdle events should be ]
well taken care of. While in high !
school, Kingbury ran the 120-yard j
high sticks in the remarkable time '
of 14:9 seconds. In the middle dis- I
tance events Atkinson seems to be !
showing the most promise so far, al- I
though the disqualification of Joe j
Burris was a severe blow to the !
strength in these races. Burris is!
credited with a mark of two min- \
utes flat in the half mile and is also j
a fine quarter miler. However, Joe !
attended Junior College one semes- j
ter, thus making him ineligible to j
