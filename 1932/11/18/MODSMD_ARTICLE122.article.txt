# CARDINAL RIDERS MEET SAN MATED FOUR HERE TODAY
## Gordan Polishes Horsemen To Tilt With Outfit Headed By Tevis 
### Bill Myers 
| Stanford will enter the polo match
I with San Mateo today with a team
I that will have a lot ol' last week's
1 rough spots knocked off. Two hard
I scrimmages this week have helped
| smooth out the ragged team-work
j shown in the Menlo game last Fri
j day.
The match will be one of the fast
; est of the season. San Mateo is
bringing down a nine-goal outfit
; that ranks among the best on the
Peninsula. Willie Tevis, Jr., who
j heads the San Mateans had not yet |
announced .his line-up last night
but among the likely starters are I
J Angel or Miguel Elizalde, Jack :
| Bradley, and Pat Linfoot.
Tevis Outstanding
j Tevis himself is one of the out- i
standing players in northern Cali- j
; i'ornia. His presence alone on a team i
j assures the opposition of a merry ;
j chase. He is officially rated at five |
goals.
The match will be played on a i
handicap basis. The Redshirts are j
dickering for a six-goal handicap, [
which should just about equalize the .
difference between the two teams. |
Captain Dick Gordan, coach of the j
Card riders, rates this year's team ]
at two goals. That Gordan's rating [
is about correct was shown last
week when the Redshirts barely
nosed out Menlo Circus Club, 7-6, j
using this unofficial handicap.
Cards Inexperienced
Stanford's lineup has Luppe Lup- ,
pen at number one, Woody Melone
at two, Pete Gillham at three, and
Johnny Myers at four. Of these
four, Gillham is the only one who
has had regular varsity experience |
before this year. Luppen and Me
lone were first among the substi
tutes, while Myers failed to get in :
any games at all.
Captain Gordan has done consid
erable shifting about of the players j
this fall, and has finally hit on this
combination as the most efficient. It I
provides for two men at the back
positions, Gillham and Myers, who !
crack out some hefty drives and thus j
make a tough defense; and up at !
the forward berths Luppen and Me- :
lone are a couple of sharp-shooters i
who can look after the scoring end. 1
Play starts promptly at 3 o'clock
this afternoon on the Highway field, j
No admission charge.
