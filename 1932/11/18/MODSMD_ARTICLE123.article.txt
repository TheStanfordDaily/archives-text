# BABE GRIDSTERS CALLED TO STANFORD FROM AFAR
## 
### Dick Strouse 
'; From Pennsylvania to Oregon, from '
; Oklahoma to Washington, big men
, and little men, strong men and ,
I speedy men â€”they came to Stanford
' with but one thing in common: the
ability to play good football. From
cities and towns and farms they j
; came, and gathered together under
Chuck Winterburn to form one of
' Stanford's greatest freshman foot
j ball teams.
! They were high school stars, these
l frosh gridders, all-state and all
! county and all-city stars. They were
stars before they ever reached ihe
Farm, and now, after rolling up 221 i
points to 20 for their opponents, they |
are still stars.
j In distant Pennsylvania, made la
| mous by the oil advertisements pie
, luring the monsters that once
i roamed its length, and by Benjamin
| Franklin, three of them heard the
j Stanford hymn and came. Attend
! ing Prep at the time, Bob Hamilton
! and Monk Moserip and Alf Brandin
! decided to help furnish Pop War- 1
j ner with the kind of material lie I
has been needing for years.
Hamilton, the most finished fresh- ,
man back seen around the Farm !
! since Kennie Afflerbaugh, co-cap- |
I tained the yearlings. Moserip played I
j right end a good part of the time.;
! and did the converting, and Brandin !
j alone among the trio was not a '
1 regular: he was out with injuries j
I although he is said to be one- first- i
! class tackle. And although they don't |
I have all-state prep teams, critics I
| claimed that Hamilton was the best !
{ football player in Pennsylvania,
j Among the wastes of Oklahoma, in j
1 the hills of Oregon, and in the for- j
ests of Washington, a trio of all- I
state players heard the call. Bob j
Grayson, the pride of Portland; Bob j
Reynolds of Okmulgee; and George i
Leedy of Wennatchee: the best in j
three states, they too came and:
played for Chuck.
1 When Stanford went up North to I
play Oregon State, the natives were j

' more interested in Grayson of the
frosh than in the entire varsity J
team. They had a right to be: he j
1 was an all-Oregon player for two
! years and a regular at Jefferson high |
; for four.
And when Reynolds returns to'
j Oklahoma he will return as a regu- |
lar frosh tackle. Leedy from Wash- |
ington also lived up to his promise, I
as he shared the left-end duties with ,
Alex Trompas.
Trompas himself comes from San j
Diego, where those who didn't watch
Mexican bull lights watched him!
star in high school. Only one first- |
I string player came from Los An- '
i geles with all its lights and suburbs: |
Oct Morgan, who prepped at Har- j
vard Military Academy and subbed
for Frank Alustiza on the frosh.
Alustiza was the best thing in a j
football way that .Stockton High
School has produced in some time. 1
Hard-working and reliable, Alustiza j
was the yearling triple-threat, j
Claude Callaway and Gordon How- I
ell, tackle and center respectively, i
are home town boys who have made j
the fi'o'sh grid team. Callaway went j
to Fresno High School and Howell ;
to Menlo High School.
Eagle Rock, Orange, and Walnut j
Creek, California, were put on the !
football map by Hunt Kingsbury, |
Ray Todd, and Primo Pinnotti. These i
leading citizens of not such leading j
towns lormed a formidable end
quarterback-guard group.
Piedmont High School gave Ben I
Palamountain and Wes Stevens to I
the varsity, and this year came up j
with Morse Erskine. And Sheldon j
Bronstein comes from the same side !
of the Bay, as he was the big little j
man at San Leandro High School.
And then there is San Francisco.
Home of the fog, the Golden Gate,
and high school games that outdraw
the college contests, the nearby me
tropolis sent five all-city football
players to Stanford and two more |
who were picked on most second
all-city teams.
