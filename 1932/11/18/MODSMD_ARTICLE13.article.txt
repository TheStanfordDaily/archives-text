# CARDS SCHEDULED TO PLAY WILDCAT SQUAD NEXT YEAR
## Northwestern Tilt To Be Big Event Of 1933 
### 
When the 1933 football season gets
under way, one of the first big
games of national importance will be
the intersectional affair between
Stanford and Northwestern to be
played next ywar in Chicago on Oc
tober 7.
Originally scheduled to meet
Stanford this year on October 15,
Northwestern asked to be relieved
from this engagement so that they
meet Michigan, a team which
the Wildcats had not played for five
years. They paid dearly for their
"walk-out" and lost to the Wolver
ines 15-7.
N.W. A Leader
Northwestern has always been
among the leaders in the Big Ten,
and last year shared the champion
ship with Purdue and Michigan. Ac
cording to reports and
the material that Coach Hanley was
to have on hand this year, the Wild
cats were scheduled for their best
season in many years.
The Wildcats haven't lived up to
expectations, winning only from
Missouri and Illinois, tying Purdue,
and losing to Michigan, Minnesota,
Ohio State, and Notre Dame.
Use "Pop's" System
Dick Hanley, coach at Northwest
ern, employs the same system as
that used by Pop Warner here at
Stanford. As a matter of fact, he
looks to Warner as his teacher, so
next year's game should be a re
newal of that time-worn situation,
always interesting, of master meet
ing pupil
Pittsburgh, added to this year's
schedule to give it one intersec
tional game, will probably not be
played next season.
