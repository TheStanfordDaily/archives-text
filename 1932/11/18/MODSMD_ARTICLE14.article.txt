## 
### 
Although it wili be some time be
fore regular freshman baseball prac
tice gets under way, indications
point toward a strong yearling team
for the 19153 season. A number of
talented ball players have entered
Stanford this year with the class of
1936, and some of them are already
working out three times a week un
der the watchful eye of Harry Wel
ter, varsity baseball mentor.
Bob Grayson, Jim Moscrip,
"Bones" Hamilton, and Oct Morgan,
all of freshman football fame, have
signified their intenlions of turning
out for baseball in the spring.
Gridir.cn to Play
Grayson, half on the strong Stan
ford frosh football team, is reputed
a first baseman of ability. He should
be a valuable asset to the team.
Hamilton and Moscrip are infield
ers. Loth these boys have plenty of
high school experience behind them.
During the football season just com
pleted they showed speed and agil
ity which will add to their effective
ness on the baseball field.
Morgan Is Catcher
Oct Morgan, fullback on the frosh
football team, is a catcher. He pos
sesses a strong arm and a rugged
build — qualities which cannot be
overlooked. Coach Murray Cudde
back will undoubtedly find Morgan
a valuable help in building a win
ning team.
Don Clark, Art Allen, Larry Mar
shall, and Ed Galbraith are at pres
ent working out with the varsity
squad. These gentlemen show prom
ise of future greatness.
Work With Varsity
Ed Galbraith has looked particu
larly impressive. He is a good hit
ter and his fielding is smooth and
sure. This week he was shifted from
second base to shortstop because of
his strong and accurate throwing
ability.
If the freshmen can unearth a few
pitchers and several powerful hit
ters they will present a well-bal
anced club.
