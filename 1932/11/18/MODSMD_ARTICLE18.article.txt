# INDIAN FOOTBALL MANAGER FULFILLS IMPORTANT DUTY
## Jack Bonte Has Numerous Tasks Unnoticed By Average Fan 
### 
The staging of the football classic
between California and Stanford
Saturday in Memorial Stadium in
volves a great deal of preparation
and planning which passes unno
ticed by the average football fan.
Tickets must be printed and dis
tributed, facilities for broadcasting
and reporting the game provided,
and traffic controls must be mapped
out.
More closely connected with the
teams themselves are the manage
rial staffs that attend to the innu
merable details which arise out of
the intricacy of modern football.
These hard-working units toil noise
lessly and efficiently behind the
scenes —caring for equipment, see
ing to the wants of the squad mem
bers, and arranging the details of
travel.
The football managing staff at
Stanford University is headed by
Jack S. Bonte, who not only has his
own exacting and important duties
but is responsible for the work of
more than a dozen assistants.
Bonte's most important jobs are
arranging accommodations for visit
ing teams and attending to the de
tails of travel when Stanford takes
to the road.
When the Stanford gridders en
train for Pittsburgh after the Cali
fornia game, Bonte will have pro
cured the tickets and arranged the
Pullman accommodations for the
squad. He will attend to the meals
and hotel reservations; and in addi
tion he will perform the hundred
and one odd jobs that will arise dur
ing the course of the trip.
Bonte's task is not an easy one,
for he carries a load of responsi
bility on his capable shoulders. He
doesn't receive much publicity for
his work—still he is a vital part of
the football organization at Stanford
and it is impossible to imagine a
game staged without his co-opera
' tion.
Scouting has been banned for this
football season between the three
teams of the Little Three league in
New England—Amherst, Wesleyan
and Williams college.
j Only seven games have been
scheduled to be played by the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. All games
will be played at Franklin Field.
University of Illinois have adopted
a $2 top for Football tickets, the low
est since 1918.

Tickets must be printed and dis
tributed, facilities for broadcasting
and reporting the game provided,
and traffic controls must be mapped
out.
More closely connected with the
teams themselves are the manage
rial staffs that attend to the innu
merable details which arise out of
the intricacy of modern football.
These hard-working units toil noise
lessly and efficiently behind the
scenes —caring for equipment, see
ing to the wants of the squad mem
bers, and arranging the details of
travel.
The football managing staff at
Stanford University is headed by
Jack S. Bonte, who not only has his
own exacting and important duties
but is responsible for the work of
more than a dozen assistants.
Bonte's most important jobs are
arranging accommodations for visit
ing teams and attending to the de
tails of travel when Stanford takes
to the road.
When the Stanford gridders en
train for Pittsburgh after the Cali
fornia game, Bonte will have pro
cured the tickets and arranged the
Pullman accommodations for the
squad. He will attend to the meals
and hotel reservations; and in addi
tion he will perform the hundred
and one odd jobs that will arise dur
ing the course of the trip.
Bonte's task is not an easy one,
for he carries a load of responsi
bility on his capable shoulders. He
doesn't receive much publicity for
his work—still he is a vital part of
the football organization at Stanford
and it is impossible to imagine a
game staged without his co-opera
' tion.
Scouting has been banned for this
football season between the three
teams of the Little Three league in
New England—Amherst, Wesleyan
and Williams college.
j Only seven games have been
scheduled to be played by the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. All games
will be played at Franklin Field.
University of Illinois have adopted
a $2 top for Football tickets, the low
est since 1918.
