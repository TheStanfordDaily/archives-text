# 8 LETTERMEN RETURN TO BOLSTER UP VARSITY NINE'S PROSPECTS NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
With eight returning lettermen
and a large squad of promising
players out for fall practice, pros
pects for Stanford's 1933 baseball
team are looking brighter every day.
The close of football season will
bring several more players back to
the diamond.
Captain Ike Livermore, with two
years' experience as catcher, heads
the list of returning lettermen. Stan
Anderson, last year's star twirler,
and Herm Estos, who is showing
great improvement on the mound,
both won their letters in 1931. Trip
lett at second, Delir.as at short stop,
and Trautman at third, and Massey,
catcher, are all veterans with varsity
experience. The only returning let-
terman in ihe outfield is Dick Miles,
who played right field on last year's
squad.
Outstanding in a group of rapidly
developing pitchers are Fred Har
ringer, Bob Savinski, Harry Stark,
and Lefty Campbell. Harringer
starred for the frosh last year while
Savinski was kept on what corre
sponds to the Gray team.
At first base, Art Hearn, Gordy
Mallatratt, and Frank Millsap are
fighting for the position with no one
of the three having a decided ad
vantage. Mallatratt held down the
first base position on last year's

i yearling outfit.
■ Woolley, Clancy, and Hall are do
ing their best to capture the posi
' tion of Bill Triplett, veterajfi second
baseman. Clancy played Ijor Menlo
| J.C. last year while Woolley made
j his numerals on the froshfnine.
So far Bert Delmas is / the only
' serious contender for the short stop
| position. Third base beryii is ably
i ; filled by Jevry Trautilian with
| Byrnes running competition.
The two most promising outfield
, j ers in addition to Miles* are For-
I sythe and Nutting. The lalter comes
, | to Stanford with an imposing record
, ! from Santa Monica J.C. C ..her prom
■ ; ising fielders are Irsfelq , Newman,
; and Stine. I
! Eighteen league games, will be in
| eluded in the Stanford s phedule al
! though it has not definitely
' made out. Farm baseball fans wiil
j have the opportunity offseeing their
{team in action against strong com
-1 petition as two out of three of the
j Cal and St. Mary's games will be
played on the Stanford diamond. At
least six practice games will be
' listed to put the squad in shape.
Negotiations are being made with
? Japanese authorities by Frank
• Lloyd, senior manager, and pros
? j pects of making an Oriental tour

With eight returning lettermen
and a large squad of promising
players out for fall practice, pros
pects for Stanford's 1933 baseball
team are looking brighter every day.
The close of football season will
bring several more players back to
the diamond.
Captain Ike Livermore, with two
years' experience as catcher, heads
the list of returning lettermen. Stan
Anderson, last year's star twirler,
and Herm Estos, who is showing
great improvement on the mound,
both won their letters in 1931. Trip
lett at second, Delir.as at short stop,
and Trautman at third, and Massey,
catcher, are all veterans with varsity
experience. The only returning let-
terman in ihe outfield is Dick Miles,
who played right field on last year's
squad.
Outstanding in a group of rapidly
developing pitchers are Fred Har
ringer, Bob Savinski, Harry Stark,
and Lefty Campbell. Harringer
starred for the frosh last year while
Savinski was kept on what corre
sponds to the Gray team.
At first base, Art Hearn, Gordy
Mallatratt, and Frank Millsap are
fighting for the position with no one
of the three having a decided ad
vantage. Mallatratt held down the
first base position on last year's

i yearling outfit.
■ Woolley, Clancy, and Hall are do
ing their best to capture the posi
' tion of Bill Triplett, veterajfi second
baseman. Clancy played Ijor Menlo
| J.C. last year while Woolley made
j his numerals on the froshfnine.
So far Bert Delmas is / the only
' serious contender for the short stop
| position. Third base beryii is ably
i ; filled by Jevry Trautilian with
| Byrnes running competition.
