# "STANFORD DUE TO MAKE OWN BREAKS AND WIN TOMORROW"-â€”TRAINER DENNY
## 
### 
Perhaps there has been (some)
curiosity among the freshmen as to
who is that singular person who
runs on the field between quarters
to administer aid lo the players.
Well, Frosh, set your minds at rest
for he is Wallace Denny, veteran
Stanford trainer and aide to Pop
Warner through many football wars.
Because of his constant contact
with the boys, he is admirably suited
to tell us a few things about Stan
lord's chances against the Cal outfit
in this year's Big Game. When ques
tioned as to what he thought of our
chances to subdue the Golden Bears
he said, "U.S.C. has the most pow
erful team in the country and yet
the records show that Stanford was
able to hold its own with them ex

| cept for the two times U.S.C. got
! lucky breaks.
''We all know that U.C.L.A. took
i Stanford on breaks and that Wash
j ington beat us by taking quick ad
| vantage when Stanford was napping
j a little.
"Last year California outfought us
j to a victory, but I believe that Stan
ford is just about due to make her
I own breaks and win next Saturday.
"As a trainer, it is my privilege
to come very close to the boys and
having seen them in the midst of
their toughest games this fall, I
! know the majority have given their
j very best in these games.''
