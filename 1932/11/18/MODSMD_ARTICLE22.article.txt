# Crew Of 1500 Tends Huge Grid Fan Army
## Printing Exceeds Million Pieces; B.A.C. Officials Spend Months Handling Tickets; Complimentaries Go To 380, Including 240 Press Men 
### BOB LETTS 
While 80,000 people sit on edge in
Berkeley tomorrow watching Cali
fornia and Stanford battle it out in
football, another group of about
1,500 will be milling among the spec
tators and outside the bowl seeing
that the public is satisfied.
Away back in February of this
year, first plans for the game were
being laid by representatives of the
two schools, but members of the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control
have contributed the information
told herein in response to interviews
based on questions as if the game
were being held in the Card Sta
dium,
Call Print Bids Early
The first step was the advertising
for bids on more than a million
pieces of printed material, ranging
from tickets and envelopes to appli
cations and advertising posters. The
bids were opened a month later, in
March, and this phase of the work
was completed before students left
for the summer vacation.
After the tickets arrived, they
re-sorted, under the direction
of Jake Erwin of the ticket depart
ment, for convenience of handling
later. Before the pasteboards were
finally mailed out, Erwin and his
five assistants had put each appli
cation through 12 processes, and the
individual tickets went through six
more steps of possible mistakes be
fore the postman delivered them to
their owners. An immense amount
of accurate bookkeeping was neces
sary, and constant checking was
done to catch any errors. The me
chanical assistance of an elaborate
cash register machine and a large
set of kardex files expedited the
work.
Seat Allotment Hard
One of the hardest jobs that the
ticket men had was to make correct
allotments and assignments of seats
—a task which they completed al
most without fault.
But before any of the applications
can be filled, three or four men |
spent nearly a whole month assem- j
bling material to mail—the applica- |
lions, instructions, return envelopes J
going in each letter sent to members j
in good standing with the Alumni |
Association.
The applications are mailed out by |
geographical zones and are sent out
in groups with the idea of having !
all of them reach their destinations
at the same time. All the requests
for tickets are due back early in
August. Oddly enough, an alumnus :
living in Oregon has been the first 1
to reply in the last two years.
Of the 88,000 seats in Stanford j
Stadium, only 380 are saved for i
complimentary purposes, and of
these 240 are located in the press ;
box. Cameramen for moving pictures
and newspapers take some of the 1
rest and the balance are used largely
for "good will" accommodations for
representatives of other schools and
important officials.

During all of the preliminary go
ings on in the ticket department,
Manager Alfred R. Masters is kept
busy supervising the entire outlay
in addition to keeping upon his other
office duties.
Likewise, Don E. Liebendorfer,
news bureau director, and O. H.
Tucker, manager of operations, are
getting set to publicize the game and
handle visitors as quickly and po
litely as possible.
Liebendorfer has his window
cards and special program covers
printed early in the year. He ac
cepts suggestions from anybody—
students or outsiders —for cover de
signs, and if the sample is used there
is a financial return for the trouble.
Incidentally, that seemingly trivial
cost is just one of scores that cut a
nice slice off what apparently looks
like a larger "gate."
Practically all the ideas for covers
have been submitted by outsiders,
Liebendorfer said, although some
students have been ambitious and
have made side money with their
efforts. Less attention is paid to de
signs for the tickets, but new ones
appear for every game.
Ducat Demand Excessive
The publicity angle of an impor
tant game is not normally a terrific
job, since the demand exceeds the
ticket supply in ordinary times, it
was pointed out, but the requests
for information and pictures . of
Stanford players makes it compul
sory that early arrangements are
made.
Then there is the program itself.
Pictures and data must be secui'ed
from the rival school. Art work must
be done for the p-ture layouts.
Probable starting lineups must be
secured in time to print them in the
book. And the tough part of that
is that most of the work must be
held Mp until the week before the
game. The programs generally go
to press five to seven days before
hand.
Enlist Police Aid
When the day of the game finally
arrives, and people flock to the
scene from all directions and from
great distances, the band of 1,500
directed by Orville Tucker goes to
work. State highway patrolmen are
detailed to handle the thousands of
automobiles that converge on the
stadium within a brief space of time.
Student poflce organize the parking
and direct traffic. Detectives mingle
with the crowd and keep order
there. Other students take tickets
and keep out the One-Eyed Con
nolley's, while still others usher the
people to their seats or sell programs
or run the concessions.
Comes the end of the game, the
people try to leave as fast as they
came. They get away within a short
time. The big event i.: over for
them, but it lingers on two or three
months before the B.A.C. books are
finally closed—and then it's time to
start all over again.
