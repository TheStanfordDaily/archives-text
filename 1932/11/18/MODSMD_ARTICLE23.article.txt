# BABE WATER POLO SQUAD READY FOR SAN JOSE SEXTET
## Seven Games On Schedule For Winter Quarter 
### 
Having defeated Mountain View!
High School twice by laj-ge scores, I
the unbeaten Stanfordpfreshman wa
ter polo team is practicing daily in
the Enema pool for its coming bat
tle, next Tuesday with the San Jose
State septet. This contest will mark
the last game of the Autumn Quar
ter but a regular schedule of seven
games has been made out for the
winter months.
Palo Alio High. Sequoia High, and
the St. Mary's frosh will be played
twice each before the contest with
the California Cubs. This contest
will take place about the last of Feb
ruary and should be an evenly di
vided game. Although the Stanford
freshman team hasn't lost a game to
the Golden Bears in seventeen years
of competitioh, the Indians expect a i
real battle this season.
Al Dowden is coaching his first i
year at Berkeley and it is rumored j
that he has a very strong team. Com- j
ing from Fullerton High School j
where he turned out three Southern i
California championship squads in j
Ihrce years, Dowden is known to 1
have brought, part of his star aggre- i
gat ion with him, thus forming the
nucleus of a powerful outfit.
"However," stated Coach Nort '
Thornton of the Indian Babes, '"We |
never have lost to them and we do !
not intend to start this year."' Coach j
Thornton expressed himself as being |
much pleased with the improvement j
shown by the members of his squad !
since the beginning of the season. Al- I
though the turnout of twenty-eight |
men was the largest in the history i
of the school, it lacked quality. How- j
ever through hard work and co-op
eration the team has shown great
improvement and although no indi-,
vidual stars have been developed, the
team work is improving rapidly.
The most promising forwards are |
Phil Bateson, Charlie Danforth, El
bert Rulison, James Ludlum, and j
George Pollock. Outstanding among
the guards are Pierson Dean, Elliott [
Viney, De Myers, Norman Buell, I
William Baxter, Richard TVltil John!

Green, and Phil Prescott.
Ken Livingston, William Nash, and
Al Favour are the best of the goal
