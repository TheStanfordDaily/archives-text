# Eleven Reasons for a Bigger "Big Game"

HERB DANA (right), whose flashy, striped shirt,
bloodhound tactics in following the pigskin, and heady
work in handling teams, have made him the most colorful
and most outstanding referee on the coast. He will be in
there tomorrow, ahead of the hall most of the time.

GORDY CAMPBELL, ace of
Warners quarterback trio, and
the boy who will be piloting Stan
ford tomorrow. Believe it or not,
the pass he is about to toss is
intended for the remote arms of
Don Colvin, in the lower left cor
ner. Gordy has the distinction of
not having called his own number
yet on a running play. He does
the passing while he is on the
field, and does a mighty slick job
of running back punts. Watch him
shoot the Indian arrows!

ARLEIGH WILLIAMS (below),
who has stepped into the shoes that
Hank Schaldach has been trying to
fill for lo these many years. Williams
has been the answer to Coach In
gram's prayers for a man who could
run, pass, and kick, and not be on
the bench most of the time with in
juries. It was this young man who
pulled the Washington game out of
the fire by passing to Castro for the
extra point while the Huskies were
rushing in to block the expected
kick.


JACK HILL
MAN, who has
taken up where
his famous
brother Harry
left off as Pop's
first - string
fullback. The
younger Hillman
punts them long
and high, runs
the ends with
ease, and hits the
line like a ton of
bricks. If he is
back in physical
shape by the
time Dana's
whistle opens
the game, Cali
fornia's Bears
will have their
work cut out for
them trying to
stop this human
battering-ram,
who is as fast
and brainy as
he is tough.




GEORGE GREY, the boy
who lifts them over the goal
line consistently on kickoffs,
and then retires to the line
to play one of the best
games at tackle seen on the
Stanford team in a long
time. This is Grey's last
crack at the Golden Bears
and he has set his heart on
making up for the beating
the Bears handed Stanford
last year, when they took
home that 6-0 victory. Hold
ing the hall is BfLL SfM,
who has gladdened the heart
of Pop Warner with the
manner in which he has
fallen into the Indian sys
tem. Sim is a fine running
mate for the hard-hitting
Ernie Caddel.


COACH "NAVY BfLL" IN GRAM. talking over the finer points
of the game with CAPTAIN DICK TOZER, who rates as one of
the toughest tackles on the coast. Tozer is a senior, and if he wins
tomorrow it will be two out of three for him. He was on the
losing team two years ago, and the winning outfit last year. Now
he's gunning for the odd game of the series. Watch out, Stanford,
he's a fancy ballplayer. And right below him we have ED WATER
BURY, first-stringer at the start of the season, but relegated to the
second team by injuries. He will probably get in the game at end
tomorrow.


And DON COLVIN is the hoy who is stretching up
eager arms for that Campbell pass from the far upper
corner, just as he leaps to nab the hall out of the air in
game after game. Don's phenomenal ability to snag passes
in impossible situations has won for him a far-flung reputa
tion for sticky fingers, and Pop will count on him for
another brilliant performance at left end tomorrow at
Berkeley.


HARD LUCK HANK 1
SCHALDACH (right),
Berkeley's triple-threat
left halfback, who does
the kicking, passing,
and signal-calling when
he is in the game. In
addition he does most
of the hall - packing
when he is in shape.
Hank has been on the
bench with one injury
or another for the ma
jor part of the last
three years. This is his
last crack at the In
dians, and he hopes
that he is in shape to
play the whole game
against his greatest
rivals.
