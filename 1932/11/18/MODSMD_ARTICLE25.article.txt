# GLENN S. WARNER ENDS 38TH YEAR AS GRIDIRON COACH
## 
### Jack Jernegan 
When the Stanford football team
comes of! Pitt Field a week from to
morrow afternoon, it will mark the
close of the 38th year of active coach
ing for the man who ranks with
Alonzo Stagg as dean of American
gridiron coaches, Pop Warner.
Since 1895 Stanford's "Old Fox"
has been roaming the football battle
Holds, leading his teams to victories
on far flung fronts and confounding
his enemies with the strategems that
are continually cropping up in the
game's most fertile brain.
Ninth Bear (lame
Tomorrow he will face California
for the ninth time, and as he looks
back on the live defeats that Stan
ford elevens have inflicted on the
Golden Bear since he came to the
Farm in 1924, he may let his mind
run over the years between 19112
and the day in 1890 when he left the
little town of Springville, New York,
to commence his football career on
the Cornell campus.
Pop will see quite a panorama if i
he does. Three years he held down j
the guard post on the Ithacan vai - j
sity; he was captain during the last
one, 1894. Then the plunge into ;
coaching, a month at Ames College,
now lowa State, and a quick change 1
to the University of Georgia.
Back at Cornell
After two years, daring which he
spent a m. nth each fall at Ames
and the rest at Georgia, he was back
at Cornell, thit time to show the
boys how. Two years more and he
found himself in the unknown ter
ritory of Carlisle Indian School,
where he really won his spurs.
Many and varied are the legends
that have grown up around War
ner's Carlisle teams, .some of them
true and some folklore, but there j
can be no question that while he
was there the Indians became the !
most colorful team in history. The
era that saw the development of Jim
Thorpe alsu saw the original hidden
ball play, when a Carlisle man j
stuffed the ball under his jersey and J
ran the length of the field for a
touchdown against Harvard.
Indians Good
Hopelessly outclassed in man
power and equipment, Carlisle, un
der Warner's versatile direction, j
played on even or better terms with j
the football powers of the country. |
With a three-year intermission for
a return to Cornell in 1904-05-06,
Pop stayed at the Indian School I
from 1899 to 1911. inclusive. In 1915 ,
he transferred to Pittsburgh, where j
for five years his teams didn't lose 1
ii single college game. The 191(5 Pitt
machine is considered one of the,
greatest ever seen.
It was in 1921 that Warner listened
to the siren song of the West Coast, J
and in 1924 he followed his ground-I
breaker, Andy Kerr, to Stanford. J
His success here was immediate, the j
'24 team going undefeated through j
its regular season and losing only |
to Notre Dame, in the famous Rose \
Bowl tilt.
Since his arrival Stanford has a ;
record of (54 games won. 11 lost, and
7 tied. The Cards have beaten Cali- |
fornia five times, tied twice, and j
lost once. They have won or tied i
for the conference championship j
three times.
Pop Fixture Here
Having built a house in Palo Alto I
in 1927, Pop has been pretty much j
of a fixture here for the past nine !
years, although perennial rumors j
crop up that he is considering a;
change.
At present when not busy with j
the Card gridmen, he occupies his <
time with the various hobbies that !
appeal to his versatile brain. Sum- j
mers are taken up by fishing trips !
and instruction at coaching schools j
around the country, at which insti- '
tutions he is much in demand.
Making golf clubs, repairing fur- !
niture, painting, and designing the :
training apparatus ar.d protective !
devices are among his other inter- !
ests.

machine is considered one of the,
greatest ever seen.
It was in 1921 that Warner listened
to the siren song of the West Coast, J
and in 1924 he followed his ground-I
breaker, Andy Kerr, to Stanford. J
His success here was immediate, the j
'24 team going undefeated through j
its regular season and losing only |
to Notre Dame, in the famous Rose \
Bowl tilt.
Since his arrival Stanford has a ;
record of (54 games won. 11 lost, and
7 tied. The Cards have beaten Cali- |
fornia five times, tied twice, and j
lost once. They have won or tied i
for the conference championship j
three times.
Pop Fixture Here
Having built a house in Palo Alto I
in 1927, Pop has been pretty much j
of a fixture here for the past nine !
years, although perennial rumors j
crop up that he is considering a;
change.
At present when not busy with j
the Card gridmen, he occupies his <
time with the various hobbies that !
appeal to his versatile brain. Sum- j
mers are taken up by fishing trips !
and instruction at coaching schools j
around the country, at which insti- '
tutions he is much in demand.
Making golf clubs, repairing fur- !
niture, painting, and designing the :
training apparatus ar.d protective !
devices are among his other inter- !
ests.
When the Stanford football team
comes of! Pitt Field a week from to
morrow afternoon, it will mark the
close of the 38th year of active coach
ing for the man who ranks with
Alonzo Stagg as dean of American
gridiron coaches, Pop Warner.
Since 1895 Stanford's "Old Fox"
has been roaming the football battle
Holds, leading his teams to victories
on far flung fronts and confounding
his enemies with the strategems that
are continually cropping up in the
game's most fertile brain.
Ninth Bear (lame
Tomorrow he will face California
for the ninth time, and as he looks
back on the live defeats that Stan
ford elevens have inflicted on the
Golden Bear since he came to the
Farm in 1924, he may let his mind
run over the years between 19112
and the day in 1890 when he left the
little town of Springville, New York,
to commence his football career on
the Cornell campus.
Pop will see quite a panorama if i
he does. Three years he held down j
the guard post on the Ithacan vai - j
sity; he was captain during the last
one, 1894. Then the plunge into ;
coaching, a month at Ames College,
now lowa State, and a quick change 1
to the University of Georgia.
Back at Cornell
After two years, daring which he
spent a m. nth each fall at Ames
and the rest at Georgia, he was back
at Cornell, thit time to show the
boys how. Two years more and he
found himself in the unknown ter
ritory of Carlisle Indian School,
where he really won his spurs.
Many and varied are the legends
that have grown up around War
ner's Carlisle teams, .some of them
true and some folklore, but there j
can be no question that while he
was there the Indians became the !
most colorful team in history. The
era that saw the development of Jim
Thorpe alsu saw the original hidden
ball play, when a Carlisle man j
stuffed the ball under his jersey and J
ran the length of the field for a
touchdown against Harvard.
Indians Good
Hopelessly outclassed in man
power and equipment, Carlisle, un
der Warner's versatile direction, j
played on even or better terms with j
the football powers of the country. |
With a three-year intermission for
a return to Cornell in 1904-05-06,
Pop stayed at the Indian School I
from 1899 to 1911. inclusive. In 1915 ,

now lowa State, and a quick change 1
to the University of Georgia.
Back at Cornell
After two years, daring which he
spent a m. nth each fall at Ames
and the rest at Georgia, he was back
at Cornell, thit time to show the
boys how. Two years more and he
found himself in the unknown ter
ritory of Carlisle Indian School,
where he really won his spurs.
Many and varied are the legends
that have grown up around War
ner's Carlisle teams, .some of them
true and some folklore, but there j
can be no question that while he
was there the Indians became the !
most colorful team in history. The
era that saw the development of Jim
Thorpe alsu saw the original hidden
ball play, when a Carlisle man j
stuffed the ball under his jersey and J
ran the length of the field for a
touchdown against Harvard.
Indians Good
Hopelessly outclassed in man
power and equipment, Carlisle, un
der Warner's versatile direction, j
played on even or better terms with j
the football powers of the country. |
With a three-year intermission for
a return to Cornell in 1904-05-06,
Pop stayed at the Indian School I
from 1899 to 1911. inclusive. In 1915 ,
he transferred to Pittsburgh, where j
for five years his teams didn't lose 1
ii single college game. The 191(5 Pitt
machine is considered one of the,
greatest ever seen.
It was in 1921 that Warner listened
to the siren song of the West Coast, J
and in 1924 he followed his ground-I
breaker, Andy Kerr, to Stanford. J
His success here was immediate, the j
'24 team going undefeated through j
its regular season and losing only |
to Notre Dame, in the famous Rose \
Bowl tilt.
Since his arrival Stanford has a ;
record of (54 games won. 11 lost, and
7 tied. The Cards have beaten Cali- |
fornia five times, tied twice, and j
lost once. They have won or tied i
for the conference championship j
three times.
Pop Fixture Here
Having built a house in Palo Alto I
in 1927, Pop has been pretty much j
of a fixture here for the past nine !
years, although perennial rumors j
crop up that he is considering a;
change.
At present when not busy with j
the Card gridmen, he occupies his <
time with the various hobbies that !
appeal to his versatile brain. Sum- j
mers are taken up by fishing trips !
and instruction at coaching schools j
around the country, at which insti- '
tutions he is much in demand.
Making golf clubs, repairing fur- !
niture, painting, and designing the :
training apparatus ar.d protective !
devices are among his other inter- !
ests.
