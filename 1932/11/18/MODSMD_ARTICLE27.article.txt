# MANY BILLS ON STANFORD FOOTBALL SQUAD; CHUCKS, BOBS NUMEROUS TOO
## 
### 
The Bills have it.
Not the little, white kind that ar
rive the first of every month long
before father's check, but the big
brawny kind that play football and
are named Bates, Corbus, Doub, and
Sim.
For the varsity grid squad boasts
four Williams, who manage to out
nickname the three Chucks and the
trio of Bobs by one scant player.
Prelsnik, White, and Rogers were
christened Charles, and Maentz,
Moore, and O'Connor were named
Robert by trusting mothers; and al
though they can't all be President,
they all do wear varsity jerseys.
The common name of John is not
so common among the gridders, as
it is owned only by Hancock and
Card. But Hillman and Holwerda
constitute a fine pair of Jacks: al
ways hard to beat.
Since only two red-headed Stan
ford students play enough football
to be on the varsity, only Targhetta
and Gribben are nicknamed Red.
Johnston and Baker Phil up this
space, and Wes Stevens and Wes
Muller complete the duplications.
Romantic names that would please
the least idealistic and idolistic co-ed

include Jay, Gordie, Carlos, Van,
Bruce, Lee, and Mar. Tod, Campbell,
Monsalve, Van Kirk, Tarver, Blan
chard, and Albertson are the boys
with a natural head-start toward
matrimonial culmination of a college
football career.
To offset thic poetry there are the
wild and woolly Western appella
tions of Buck, Jeff, and Tex. Good
rangers all, Van Dellen, Minckler,
and Walker answer to nothing fan
cy, although Van Dellen WAS
christened Elzo.
Maino and Allen own perhaps the
oddest of the names, as they are
called Rusty and Dusty respectively,
the latter as an abbreviation of Dus
ter. Rogers 'could do nothing but
shorten Thornwell to Thornie, while
Laborde of the > massive biceps has
combined his name Henri and his
appearance Hercules to Here.
The list is completed with eleven
ordinary monickers of the common,
or garden, variety. Thus there are:
Ed Lettunich, Don Colvin, George
Grey, Fred Scrbner, Tom Lambert,
Ben Palamountain, Stan Anderson,
Ted Kite, Dave Packard, Ernie Cad
del, and Ken Afflerbaugb.
And all those Bills will start.
