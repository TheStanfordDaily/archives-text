# PLAN LEAGUE FOR BAY REGION WATER POLO ENTHUSIASTS
## 
### 
Interest in water polo competition
! in the Bay Region has been greatly
. increased with the announcement
i yesterday that there will be a Water
j Polo League formed, con.prising the
j teams of the Olympic Club, ihe
j Athens Club, California, and Stan
!ford.
It is planned to have play in this
newly-formed league begin about!
I January 28, and each team will play
a home and home series with the
other three teams. There will be a
I meeting of the coach.es and mana
: gers of the four entrants tonight at
(the Olympic Club to discuss further
; plans.
j However, Stanford's chief objec
tive this year is to avenge last year's
! defeat by the Trojan mermen at the
i Minor Sports Carnival. The 1931}
Carnival, will be held at Berkeley
sometime in the middle of April and
that will be the Indian's first and
I only chance to meet Southern Cali
' fornia.
Coach Nort Thornton has the mak
ings of a great team and if he can
j get his new style of play to func
tioning smoothly it should be almost
impossible to stop the Card swim
mers. Not that it isn't working well
now, for the varsity has been look-
I ing great in scrimmages. With the
further improvement that will come
from several months' practice, the
Indians should be able to battle on
j even terms with any team in the
I country.
Stanford's 1933 water polo team
will introduce the Hungarian style
of play, featuring a sharp-breaking,
fast-passing attack, which won the
Olympic title for the Hungarian wa
ter polo team. In addition, Coach
Thornton has evolved about a dozen
formations of his own from the tip
off, which should provide the In
dians with plenty of scoring punch.
