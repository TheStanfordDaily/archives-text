# Betting Odds Give Bears 10-8 Edge Over Indians
## 
### 
Although an influx of Stanford
money would at any time change the
odds, San Francisco betting commis
sioners list the University of Cali
fornia as a slight favorite over Stan
ford in tomorrow's embroglio.
Odds of 10 to 8 quoted on the
Bears earlier in the week have
shifted slightly, but most of the San
Francisco wagering is being done
with University of California as the
favored team.
For obvious reasons less betting
than in other years has been re
ported on the San Francisco sport
ing rialto. One betting house, how
ever, reported one client who had
$20,000 to risk on the Bears at 10 to 8.
Mindful of the present season's
many gridiron upset, football fans
have become increasingly reluctant
to back their choice with the coin
of the realm. Observers, however,
predict that in the neighborhood of
a million dollars will change hands
on the outcome of Saturday's game.
