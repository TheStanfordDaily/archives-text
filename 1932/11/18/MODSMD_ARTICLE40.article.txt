# "BEST TEAM WE EVER HAD," TWIGGS SAYS OF VARSITY GOLF AGGREGATION
## 
### JAY GRAVES 
"The best team we ever had!" 1
; That's what Eddie Twiggs, golf in
i Structor, says of this year's varsity
i golf aggregation.
I With 12 such good golfers on the
I top of the ladder, Stanford should ;
! not lose a match this year, accord- t
ing to Twiggs.
i Charlie Seaver in number one po
j sition on the team shoots a consistent
70 to 72. He's co-holder of the course
> record with Lawson Little, both hav
i ing shot the 18 holes in 69.
j Lawson is in third place and is
i able to turn in steady scores of 70
and 71. He is not quite so consistent
, as Seaver, but he is capable of de
! pendable first class golf, Twiggs
: thinks.
Harry "Bud" Eichelberger is hang
j ing on to the second rung of the lad
| der by reason of his seniority on the
i squad from last year. His normal
( shooting strength is around 72 to 74,
I and Twiggs is counting on him to be
j a power in match play next spring, i
i Stew Hawley swings his irons!
' around the course in about 72 to 75
regularly, but he lacks the consist
ency of some of his team-mates. His
i brand of golf was good enough to
] win him a qualifying round in the
j National Open and he went east io
| play in it last spring.
Transferring from Sacramento
Junior College this year, Tom Dwyer
I is beginning to show the ability
i which won him a place in the Na- !

tional Open Championship two years |
ago. So far ho has been tramping I
around 18 holes in 74 and 75, and he j
should be able to cut that down to j
about 72 or 73 before long.
Dick Giddings is still 9 or 10 down
the ladder, but Twiggs predicts that j
he will be up among the first four or j
five before very long. Recently he j
turned in four rounds with counts 1
of 74, 75, 73, 73. That brings his av
erage down to a fraction over 73, ,
which is plenty good enough for a
berth at the top of the ladder, Twiggs
declares. Giddings transferred from
Modesto J.C., and was State Junior j
College champion last year.
Charlie Seaver on the top of the j
varsity ladder, also plays football for ;
the Grays. He was the boy who car- '
ried the brunt of the attack against
the California goofs, and in a bat
tered condition the following day, he
was still able to turn in a 72 card ;
over the 71 par course.
Jack Hoerner has been playing j
basketball again. His golf is good, !
and even brilliant at times, but his j
playing is erratic and undependable.
Stew Pett can be counted on to i

i which won him a place in the Na- !

tional Open Championship two years |
ago. So far ho has been tramping I
around 18 holes in 74 and 75, and he j
should be able to cut that down to j
about 72 or 73 before long.
Dick Giddings is still 9 or 10 down
the ladder, but Twiggs predicts that j
he will be up among the first four or j
five before very long. Recently he j
turned in four rounds with counts 1
of 74, 75, 73, 73. That brings his av
erage down to a fraction over 73, ,
which is plenty good enough for a
berth at the top of the ladder, Twiggs
declares. Giddings transferred from
Modesto J.C., and was State Junior j
College champion last year.
Charlie Seaver on the top of the j
varsity ladder, also plays football for ;
the Grays. He was the boy who car- '
ried the brunt of the attack against
the California goofs, and in a bat
tered condition the following day, he
was still able to turn in a 72 card ;
over the 71 par course.
Jack Hoerner has been playing j
basketball again. His golf is good, !
and even brilliant at times, but his j
playing is erratic and undependable.

"The best team we ever had!" 1

I top of the ladder, Stanford should ;

ing to Twiggs.

j Lawson is in third place and is
i able to turn in steady scores of 70
and 71. He is not quite so consistent
, as Seaver, but he is capable of de
! pendable first class golf, Twiggs
: thinks.
