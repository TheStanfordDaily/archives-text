### Elizabeth Chapin 
Crowding the Big Game off the |
scene for tonight at least, the 1932 |
Ram's Head Gaieties will flash
across the Assembly Hall stage at
H:3O o'clock sharp and present to
Stanford a dazzling array of 35 |
.• nappy acts which include all the |
finest campus talent.
Harold Hclvenston is general di
rector of the show, with Adelaide
Kelly in charge of choruses, and
Gordon Heche and Grif Williams
co-directing the music. The settings
arc the work ot Frederick Stover.
Eph Engleman, long a Gaieties
and Junior Opera star, will appear
with Grif Williams in a novelty
double piano number. V/instead
Weaver will contribute his usual j
quota of insanity with his chapeaux, |
and Jack Redhead will also do some j
goofy sketches.
"They'll Do It Anyway," the bur- !
Usque of Lucky Strike ads, will j
feature Barbara Collins, supported !
by eight well-known campus per- j
sonalities. A singing burlesque on
the Mills girls-Stanford men situa
tion is entitled "Mills Sisters," with
Lucy Guild, Betty Maloney, and i
Frances Mosher showing consider- j
able comic talent. "The Doll Shop" i
is one of the more pretentious num- J
hers, and features Mary Anita Loos, j
Josephine Wilson, and others.
The show is replete with good
musical tunes, and iwo outstanding
ones are "Heaven's On the Levee'
by Dorothy Bernhardt, and "She
Doesn't Love Me, But She Never
Lets Me Keep Her Warm," by Craw
frrd Sullivan.
"Secret Souls," a movie by Elea
nor Harris, and "Fishes and Things,
a stereoptican lecture by Franklin
Thomas, are two sketches with good
comic possibilities. Joseph Wolf's
travesty on "Death Takes A Holi
day" should prove highly amusing,
even to those who did not see the
production. Another sketch will
burlesque Greta Garbo, the great
Swedish enigma.
Thrills as well as laughs are ex
pected from the two original crook
dramas, and from two melodramas
labeled "Back to the Gutter and
"Foiled Again."
"The bird" will also be given men's
rushing, Roblc, medical operations,
collegiate dancing, politics, and even
King Football.

is one of the more pretentious num- J
hers, and features Mary Anita Loos, j
Josephine Wilson, and others.
The show is replete with good
musical tunes, and iwo outstanding
ones are "Heaven's On the Levee'
by Dorothy Bernhardt, and "She
Doesn't Love Me, But She Never
Lets Me Keep Her Warm," by Craw
frrd Sullivan.
"Secret Souls," a movie by Elea
nor Harris, and "Fishes and Things,
a stereoptican lecture by Franklin
Thomas, are two sketches with good
comic possibilities. Joseph Wolf's
travesty on "Death Takes A Holi
day" should prove highly amusing,
even to those who did not see the
production. Another sketch will
burlesque Greta Garbo, the great
Swedish enigma.
Thrills as well as laughs are ex
pected from the two original crook
dramas, and from two melodramas
labeled "Back to the Gutter and
"Foiled Again."
"The bird" will also be given men's
rushing, Roblc, medical operations,
collegiate dancing, politics, and even
King Football.
Crowding the Big Game off the |
scene for tonight at least, the 1932 |
Ram's Head Gaieties will flash
across the Assembly Hall stage at
H:3O o'clock sharp and present to
Stanford a dazzling array of 35 |
.• nappy acts which include all the |
finest campus talent.
Harold Hclvenston is general di
rector of the show, with Adelaide
Kelly in charge of choruses, and
Gordon Heche and Grif Williams
co-directing the music. The settings
arc the work ot Frederick Stover.
Eph Engleman, long a Gaieties
and Junior Opera star, will appear
with Grif Williams in a novelty
double piano number. V/instead
Weaver will contribute his usual j
quota of insanity with his chapeaux, |
and Jack Redhead will also do some j
goofy sketches.
"They'll Do It Anyway," the bur- !
Usque of Lucky Strike ads, will j
feature Barbara Collins, supported !
by eight well-known campus per- j
sonalities. A singing burlesque on
the Mills girls-Stanford men situa
tion is entitled "Mills Sisters," with
Lucy Guild, Betty Maloney, and i
Frances Mosher showing consider- j
able comic talent. "The Doll Shop" i
is one of the more pretentious num- J
hers, and features Mary Anita Loos, j
Josephine Wilson, and others.
