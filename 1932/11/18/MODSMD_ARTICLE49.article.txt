# Old Boy Jokes About Big Game In Issue Today
## Chaparral Presents Wits Of Local Campus 
### 
Last night the Old Man ex the
Chappie, Don Cameron, and his staff
laid their pens aside and gave their
aching ribs a rest as they let the
large Big Game issue of the Chapar
ral be taken from them to be sold
on the quad today.
This edition of Stanford's humor
magazine, which caused them so
much mirth and work, is permeated
with the Big Game atmosphere of
inter-collegiate rivalry and high
spirits such as will be manifested at
and after tomorrow's football classic.
It contains a collection of jokes,
witty cracks, and cartoons from the
wits of Stanford campus with the
cream of the exchanges from the
other humor magazines of the na
tion.
The lively-colored cover of he
Chappie, the work of Jim Algar, stu
dent illustrator of some repute, is
based on an idea from Bob
Churchill, campus mirth-maker. Al
though its purpose is negligible, the
striking drawing, the size of ihe
magazine's jacket, and Ihe brilliance
of the colors impart to i! a lai ghable
and subtle meaninglessness.
The number of cartoons in â€¢ his
number is slightly larger than the
number in previous issues, a noble
improvement in itself. With ihe
added quantity in the jokes is be
lieved to be added quality.
Chappies will be sold in the U.C.
bowl during and before the Big
Game tomorrow. Bob Anderson,
Chaparral circulation manager, is in
charge of their sale there.
