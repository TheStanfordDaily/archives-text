# PAST BIG GAME DOPE NO ANGLE
## Predicted Favorites Often Upset In Outcome 
### 
Although California will be fa- !
vored over the Indians in the Big
Game Saturday, no indication of the
result can be learned from such a
prediction as can be witnessed by
results of Big Games in other years.
During the last ten years Stanford
and California have both at times
defeated the other when not picked
as the pre-game favorite, but as a
rule this has been the exception. Go
ing back to 1922, California, picked
as the favorite, easily won the game
28 to 0. The next year, however, the
experts decided the game was a loss
up with Stanford slightly favored.
The game was won by the Bears,
9 to 0, and it was their last taste of
victory for seven years. The fol
lowing year, 1924, the game was
again a toss up, with the final score
resulting in a 20 to 20 tie.
From 1925 to 1928 Stanford was
the favorite and also the victor. In
1929, however, California was unan- j
imously picked to win, but was de- !
cisively defeated, the score being 21 j
to G. The strong Cardinal squad of j
1930 was picked to win and fulfilled '
predictions by winning 41 to 0, the j
biggest score a victor has ever won !
in Big Game competition.
Last year, as most everyone j
knows, Stanford went into the Cal. !
game as a 2 to 1 underdog. The slim ;
G to 0 California victory demon- ;
strated the fact that predictions on (
the Big Game are a serious thing to â€¢
undertake due, no doubt, to the im- (
mense amount of spirit prevailing.
