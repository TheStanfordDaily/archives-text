Speaking before a crowded house
to an audience that flowed Into the
aisles and sat on the window seats,
three Stanford professors discussed
the probable consequences of the re
cent election in the Little Theatre
last night.
Appearing under the auspices of
the Walrus Club, Professors Thomas
S. Barclay, Elmer D. Lagan, and
Graham H. Stuart dealt with the po
litical, economic, and international
aspects of the Democratic victory.
