â€¢
Memories of Brown University's
! "lion Men" eleven of 1926 are
! brought to the minds of Eastern grid
i fans by the astounding record set
up so far this season by Coach Tuss
1 McLaughry's 1932 edition of the
| Bears.
' Undefeated and untied, Brown i
' points to victories over Rhode Island j
State, Springfield, Yale, Harvard, \
i Tufts, Holy Cross, and Columbia.
The only other undefeated and un- 1
tied teams in the Ea::t are Waynes- j
burg and Colgate, but neither of j
these colleges has faced the high j
calibre of opposition that has at
tempted to check Brown's march ,
toward championship recognition, j
Brown will play Colgate on
1 Thanksgiving Day.
