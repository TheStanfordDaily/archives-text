# Big Game Gaieties Relic Of Early Stanford Days
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Back in the days when the Daily
was a four-column sheet which
didn't even last through an 8 o clock,
and the Quad was a thick and
elaborately disconnected volume
with incredible art work, the first
Gaieties were born.
They came from the heat-op
pressed brain of Ram's Head, whose
first opus magnus was a comic
I opera —more comic than opera —en-
titled "Rambling Rameses." More
snooty in those days, Ram's Head
, chose to present its show sans the
J feminine charm which will grace
i tomorrow night's performance; all
parts, the daughters of the Nile, the
guardians of the Pyramids, and the i
chorines, were enacted by burly
roughs.
This was in 1912. Prior to that
year, a Gaieties-barren campus
found its pre-Big Game festivities
in the "Follies of Stanford" at some
San Francisco theatre.
Rugby good old rugger was the

•sport in those times; none of your
new-fangled American football for j
Stanford. The year 1909 found the I
name of Almon E. Roth, now j
Comptroller, as left wing three- !
quarter on the varsity rugby team.
Ram's Head went in for allitera- j
tion in its early Gaieties, and pre
sented "Wooing Wohlma" (1913) and
"Routing Razmataz" (1914). The
years of the War found gaiety and
Gaieties on the' wane, and 1915 saw
Ray Lyman Wilbur succeed Presi
dent Branner, with the pledge that
he would bend every effort to see
! that the barbarian football would
j never replace Rugby.
Nineteen-eighteen was the year j
| of the first American football game
' between the Bears and the Cardi
nals, and Stanford came out on the
oval end of a (57-0 score. t
The next year, the War over, foot
ball war began—and with it the
Gaii ties as we know them today.
And, like football, the Gaieties get
funnier every year.

The next year, the War over, foot
ball war began—and with it the
Gaii ties as we know them today.
And, like football, the Gaieties get
funnier every year.
Back in the days when the Daily
was a four-column sheet which
didn't even last through an 8 o clock,
and the Quad was a thick and
elaborately disconnected volume
with incredible art work, the first
Gaieties were born.
They came from the heat-op
pressed brain of Ram's Head, whose
first opus magnus was a comic
I opera —more comic than opera —en-
titled "Rambling Rameses." More
snooty in those days, Ram's Head
, chose to present its show sans the
J feminine charm which will grace
i tomorrow night's performance; all
parts, the daughters of the Nile, the
guardians of the Pyramids, and the i
chorines, were enacted by burly
roughs.
This was in 1912. Prior to that
year, a Gaieties-barren campus
found its pre-Big Game festivities
in the "Follies of Stanford" at some
San Francisco theatre.
Rugby good old rugger was the

•sport in those times; none of your
new-fangled American football for j
Stanford. The year 1909 found the I
name of Almon E. Roth, now j
Comptroller, as left wing three- !
quarter on the varsity rugby team.
Ram's Head went in for allitera- j
tion in its early Gaieties, and pre
sented "Wooing Wohlma" (1913) and
"Routing Razmataz" (1914). The
years of the War found gaiety and
Gaieties on the' wane, and 1915 saw
Ray Lyman Wilbur succeed Presi
dent Branner, with the pledge that
he would bend every effort to see
! that the barbarian football would
j never replace Rugby.
Nineteen-eighteen was the year j
| of the first American football game
' between the Bears and the Cardi
nals, and Stanford came out on the
oval end of a (57-0 score. t
The next year, the War over, foot
ball war began—and with it the
Gaii ties as we know them today.
And, like football, the Gaieties get
funnier every year.
