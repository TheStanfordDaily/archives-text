# Squad To Sport Candymint Trou, Old Red Uppers
## Warnermen Flaunt Jerseys Of Past Triumphs 
### Collier Connell 
The candy pants.
Pop Warner, wardrobe mistress,
would like to save them for the
Pittsburgh game.
His varsity, placing hope in the
tackle-proof qualities of aeroplane
silk-clad legs, suspects that it better
wear them tomorrow.
Scuffed somewhat by the Southern
California fracas five weeks ago, the
candy pants have been cleaned and
beautifully mended for the Big
Game. Of red-and-white striped
silk, they arc toughened by a fibre
lining, unique in their elastic seats.
In a huddle, the varsity looks like
a circle of peppermint sticks, this
piquant sight having caught the eye
of every sports page in the country.
So shall they look tomorrow.

Pop takes to himself the credit of
introducing analine dye to football.
Before he moved his team into the
original dull red pants, years ago,
no squad in America had thought to
slough ofT the regulation khaki.
After Warner's coup, the nation fol
lowed.
' Washington State's squad is pic
turesque, autumnal, with leaf-brown
J trou, warm orange jerseys, and gilt
helmets. Saint Mary's holds the
haberdashery edge over the coast,
i with a different color for each posi-
I tion â€”as perhaps blue for tackle,
i purple for guard, mocha for a half
j back.
i Warner's formula is: heavy, pad
ded practice gear for safety; light
elastic wear for the game.
