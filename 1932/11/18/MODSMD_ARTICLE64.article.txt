# BATES WILL LEAD STANFORD IN THIRTY-EIGHTH BIG GAME
## CALIFORNIA AND STANFORD BOTH HOPE TO SHOW LATENT POWER Defeated Teams Confident Of Exhibiting Finest Play Tomorrow SPEED AGAINST POWER Warner's Strategy To Face Ingram's Heavy Line 
### Bob Wade 
I Led by the man Glenn Scobey
Warner has termed the best aeting
captain Stanford has had this year,
45 Stanford varsity gridders leave
for Berkeley tomorrow, bent on
winning the 37th renewal of the
annual California-Stanford football
classic.
When Referee Herb Dana blows
his whistle for the opening kickoff
of the 38th Big Game, he will be
starting a game which means little
to the Pacific Coast Conference, but
one which means everything to the
I members of ihe two institutions
I whose rivalry is the oldest in the
I West.
Both Teams Beaten
| California has been beaten, and
I Stanford has been beaten. California
I took its defeats early in the season
1 and has come fast as the season
! waned. Stanford started out like a
j world-beater, and then upset critic-s
I and dopesters alike by dropping
j three major contests in a row.
Thrills Certain
j The Big Game has always been
j one of thrills and very often of ab
: solute reversals of form. That to
j morrow's battle will fail to provide
its share of both is most unlikely.
! And it is this element in their
j rivalry that makes each renewal of
! the game what it is.
i On the Blue and Gold side of the
i field will be Captain Dick Tozer,
, playing his 'ast year for California,
i He is rated one of ths cleverest and
\ toughest tackles on the coast, and
; this is the biggest game in his en
! tire career.
Tozer vs. Bates
, Opposite him will be Acting-Cap
i tain Bill Bates, who won his spurs
j in last year's contest, and who has
i been one of the outstanding centers
i in the West throughout the 1932
iseason.
: Squatted on the Cardinal bench,
wreathed in smoke and with every
! faculty intent on the battle being
; waged in front of him will be the
j master mind of football, Glenn
Scobey "Pop" Warner, the man
who has given more to the game
I in his 38 years of coaching than any
; other man in the country.
Chance May Decide
And opposite the venerable men
i tor, California will be depending on
! the new school in the person of
! William A. "Navy Bill" Ingram,
fighting, driving coach of the Berke
i ley Bears.
What will go on as these men pit
brain against beef, is something that
cannot bo forecast, but when train
ing and teaching, and plotting and
planning have all had their innings,
chance alone will smile on the men
of Stanford or the men of California
and tip the scales toward their final
reading.
