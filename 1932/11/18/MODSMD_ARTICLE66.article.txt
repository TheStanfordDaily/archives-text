'The Cardinal football learn is already a dead number.
"The Stanford sludenl body has long been (lancing in
llie frying pan. Perhaps Ihe time has come fol* them lo
jump ill lo (lie lire."
After all, Kdifor Frank Buck, that's rank libel. Anything
!s that von print and can't prove. And Saturday afternoon
yon, your Ddilf/ Californian, eleven gridmen, and a coach
won't he able lo prove that the Cardinal football team is
a dead number.
As for the student body, which you so cynically term a
"I he in," you're probably right. It has been on the frying
pan, put there by a Blue and Gold alumni outraged at
seeing Stanford hog all hut one ol the Big Game victories
for eight years in a stretch. Admitted, we've been greedy.
Bnl is that sufficient cause for pushing us off into the fire?
And that house from which you're throwing these rocks,
Mr. Buck. Somehow il appears, from thus distance, to be
one of those glass affairs. The players of Washington and
t'.S.C., having met both teams, predict that tomorrow will
be a Big Red Saturday.
They apparently feel that it was harder to. beat the
outfit you call a "dead number" than it was to whip your
Blue and Cold eleven. What does that make your team,
Mr. Buck, or had you thought of that?
Though we still claim it's libel, this outburst of yours
harbors well for the Big Game, which was losing prestige
as an annual Stanford victory classic.
II shows at least that the one big feed tendered the Bear
about this time last year built up that "Poor Cal" mammal,
lean from going hungry for seven long winters, into a big,
burly animal that can really growl!
