# ANENT BONFIRE ASHES
## 
### 
Elsewhere on this morning's editorial page will be
found a Campus Opinion communication from an Eneina
freshman, criticizing the Daily for its stand on the Rig
Game Bonfire. Although the editorial policy on this ques
tion has at all times been clear to Ihe editorial mind, per
haps il would bear explaining again in refuting these
erroneous l'rosh impressions.
Two days before work on the bonfire was started the
Daily printed an editorial which questioned the wisdom
< ! building the pyre this year, pointing out that it xvas a
problem belonging essentially to the Class of '36, the group
which |>111s up the money and does Ihe labor. In that same
editorial Ihe Daily plead thai, in the event a bonfire should
be erected, the freshmen show some real spirit and build
a good one.
When it had become evident thai Ihe freshmen were not
going to develop an initiative in opposition to the bonfire,
as the Daily had suggested, it was only natural to suppose
that the ('lass of 'itti was unified in support of Ihe tradi
tional Rig Game blaze. Therefore the Daily did all thai it
was possible to do from a swivel arm-chair in attempting
to incite the frosh to put over their undertaking in a
creditable manner.
The size of the pyre, Ihe lackadaisical attitude of the
majority of frosh in building it both convinced us more
fully of the worthlessness of a Rig Game Bonfire which
does not have Ihe whole-hearted suport of Ihe. freshman
class. Rut the Daily does not blame Ihe freshmen alone.
Cerlain upperclass leaders who insisted that a bonfire had
to be built, whether or no the frosh were eager to build il,
come in for their share of editorial criticism.
