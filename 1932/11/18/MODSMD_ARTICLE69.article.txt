# BULL SESSION
## LET'S BE GAY 
### 
Campus aesthetics, mis-fits, Eng
lish majors, and intellectuals are
always tittering about drawma in
some one of its many aspects. It is
they who go to the various local
productions. It is they who enjoy
"Berkeley Square" and '"Death
Takes A Holiday." But unfortun
ately, there are not enough of these
creatures around; and so if dra
matics were always tu be draw
miitics, the histrionic company would
have to climb into diving suits to
exist in what would be a Red Sea—
of INK.
LUckily, once every year a pro
duction is presented which appeals
to the campus L.C.D.—and lis a re
sult sufficient profit is made to fqed
the aesthetic spirit for the rest of
the year. That is the "Big Game
Gaieties." In appealing to the Low
est Common Denominator of cam
pus taste in drama —it makes money.
And upon that money, the more
sedate, cultural forms of amusement
are able to live in snooty superiority.
There is never any doubt that the
Gaieties will click. Everyone can
laugh. It is a bit more difficult to
thrill to the philosophical bursts that
are bantered about in modern
drama—with a long "a." Then, also,
there is always a chorus or two —
which is always startling if nothing
else. It may seem incredible to
those who frequent the Quad, but
a fairly attractive—if not outstand
ingly seductive —dance group is usu
ally beaten into shape.
This may seem impossible—but

| with tricky outfits leaving (fortun
ately) more to the imagination than
| the vision, with plenty of makeup,
and ample lighting—the howling
roughs piled far away in the gallery
think the chorus is good looking.
There are so many people in the
j Gaiety cast that someone behind
you is always talking and trying to
' point out her roommate's friend, the
blond adonis in the history class,
{ or other luminary.
There is that homey, folksy, domi
i nantly agrarian appeal to every
| Gaieties which will not be lacking
in tonight's performance..Then, too,
. every Gaieties always strikes at
I least one high spot which serves as
j a basis for campus banter for the
! ensuing year—and sometimes even
longer. There is the Could-Speegle
•Radio skit from way back in 1928.
| And last year had its "Good Old
' George" to soften the year's stormy
and stony way.
In fact, if you don't see the Gaie
; ties, your social education is incom
; plete. You miss all your friends' sly
I attempts at humor for months. Fail
j ing to go tonight is a social sin
| comparable to halitosis and just one
| step less serious than 8.0.
The Big Game Gaieties are not a
' cultural tonic. They bear no re
\ semblance whatsoever to Shakes
j peare, Sophocoles, Plato, or Em
-5 manuel Kant. Just for that reason
j the Assembly Hall tonight will be
jciowded with people, uproarious
; laughter, and loud applause.

have to climb into diving suits to
exist in what would be a Red Sea—
of INK.
LUckily, once every year a pro
duction is presented which appeals
to the campus L.C.D.—and lis a re

the aesthetic spirit for the rest of
the year. That is the "Big Game
Gaieties." In appealing to the Low
est Common Denominator of cam

And upon that money, the more
sedate, cultural forms of amusement
are able to live in snooty superiority.
There is never any doubt that the
Gaieties will click. Everyone can
laugh. It is a bit more difficult to
thrill to the philosophical bursts that
are bantered about in modern
drama—with a long "a." Then, also,
there is always a chorus or two —
which is always startling if nothing
else. It may seem incredible to
