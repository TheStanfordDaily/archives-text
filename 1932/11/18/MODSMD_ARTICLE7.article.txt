# INJURIES RECUR ON CARD SQUAD
## Corbus, Sim Alone Escape Hurts This Season 
### 
Fewer injuries than usual but |
enough to weaken the team in some
position all of the time have faced
Pop Warner during all of the pres
ent season. In fact, Bill Corbus and I
Bill Sim, alpne among the regulars, i
have not been out at some time dur- j
ing the year.
Red Gribben got the hospital list j
off to an auspicious start, as his
trick knee was really a hangover
from the 1931 season. Then came I
another tackle, George Grey, with ]
an early season injured leg that only |
recently has healed sufficiently to j
allow him to play his best football.
The third of Warner's "Big Three''
or "Three Big" tackles, Here La
borde, got his in the Oregon State j
game. In fact, the three big of thr \
big thi ee have never all been in the I
best of shape at one time.
Maentz Hurt
That Oregon State affair also cost j
the Indians the services of Bob j
Maentz, whose knee finally resumed i
its rightful strength in time for the j
California Aggie game, only to find |
that the rest of Bob's body was suf- ■
fering from the flu. And Ernie Cad- j
del, touted all-American, twisted his >
shoulder (or had it twisted for him) j
in the muscle test against the tough ;
boys from Santa Clara.
Gordie Campbell got his in the j
knee in the Santa Clara game. Most i
of the regulars didn't appear against !
the Army, so Maentz was the only ]
one unable to start against U.S.C.
The Trojans, although winning
the game, didn't hurt any Indians
while so doing, and the Cards went |
down to U.C.L.A. with only Maentz
missing. But they came back with
no less than six minor casualties.
Others Injured
Bill Doub, Bill Bates, Don Col
vin, Mar Albertson, Jack Hillman,
and Jay Tod were all bunged up to
some extent,, but all managed to get
back into harness in time for the
Washington Husky onslaught.

borde, got his in the Oregon State j
game. In fact, the three big of thr \
big thi ee have never all been in the I
best of shape at one time.
Maentz Hurt
That Oregon State affair also cost j
the Indians the services of Bob j
Maentz, whose knee finally resumed i
its rightful strength in time for the j
California Aggie game, only to find |
that the rest of Bob's body was suf- ■
fering from the flu. And Ernie Cad- j
del, touted all-American, twisted his >
shoulder (or had it twisted for him) j
in the muscle test against the tough ;
boys from Santa Clara.
Gordie Campbell got his in the j
knee in the Santa Clara game. Most i
of the regulars didn't appear against !
the Army, so Maentz was the only ]
one unable to start against U.S.C.
The Trojans, although winning
the game, didn't hurt any Indians
while so doing, and the Cards went |
down to U.C.L.A. with only Maentz
missing. But they came back with
no less than six minor casualties.
Others Injured
Bill Doub, Bill Bates, Don Col
vin, Mar Albertson, Jack Hillman,
and Jay Tod were all bunged up to
some extent,, but all managed to get
back into harness in time for the
Washington Husky onslaught.
