THE MERRY WIDOW (Lehar)—At ,
the Columbia Theatre.
Although no feature of this opcr- j
etta is outstanding, the whole works
so smoothly that the result is enter- i
tainment of a high order. The play i
and the Ynusic are too familiar to J
need any comment; it is sufficient j
to say that The Merry Widow has j
been deservedly popular for a quar- j
ter of a centui-y, and will undoubt- j
edly remain so.
The production, barring a dull
orchestra, has few faults. One does j
not expect vocal acrobatics in light
opera, and the singers displayed i
none, although all had pleasing |
voices and sang with the l-equisitc ,
amount of ease. Ruth Gillette and j
Alex Callam, who sang the leads, 1
contributed the best work. The |
dancing and chorus work were also I
excellent—the San Francisco Opera '
chorus could really leaiTi something
from this unassuming one.
The acting, too, was adequate but
not brilliant. Herbert Evans as |
Baron Popoff and Roland Woodruff
as Nisch can be singled out for spe
cial mention. These, the two main
comedy roles, were the only ones j
which allowed much opportunity
for acting.
The choice of a good vehicle, the
almost perfect co-ordination of all ,
the factors involved, and the en
thusiasm shown by the cast com
bine to make the production well
worth seeing. —Zimansky
David Scott, designer of the pro- I

I duction, deserves commendation for
J simple but extraordinarily effective
(settings. With a minimum of detail
i and fine colors, he made a fine
background for*the romantic mu
sical. The third act setting (Maxim's)
j was the least well done; there was
! unusual use of a black cyclorama
i in the second act. —Sandoe

TIIE PURCHASE PRICE (Warner
Bros.) —At the California Theatre.
A new situaxion is developed in
I (his picture—a cabaret girl marries
a farmer through a matrimonial
| magazine, and then falls in love
j with him.
The story is taken from "The Mud
j Lark." It is a better vehicle for
1 Barbara Stanwyck's talents than
| most of her previous roles. The
! novelty of a cabaret girl pursuing
on unpolished farmer offers unique
possibilities and gives her an oppor
tunity to act again whereas former
cabaret roles have been so stereo
typed that very little originality in
interpretation could be expected.
Stanwyck's talent to portray emo
tional acting is enhanced by a scene
which shifts from New York and
! Montreal night clubs to Canadian
wheat fields.
The success of the picture does
i not depend wholly upon emotional
acting, the situation and the happy
ending make it interesting and en
tertaining as a play, and not just
j another flood of Stanwyck tears.
