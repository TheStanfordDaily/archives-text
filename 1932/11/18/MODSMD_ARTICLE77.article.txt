## WOOD FOR UNEMPLOYED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The logical conclusion to your
editorials about the Bonfire and the
need for wood among the unem
ployed seems to be this: To have
the Frosh collect the wood as usual
but to distribute it among those that
need it. Or better yet to make it a
University activity, similar to Labor
Day, in the spring.
At this time of the year, when
winter is a real threat to many, such
an activity on your part would be
real help and could be real pleasure,
too.
Let's do it.
