The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday evening I thought it
advisable to take a "look in" on the
Stanford Big Game Rallyâ€”possibly
because I go to Stanford, for lack
of another reason. I found the ac
tivities of the evening very inter
esting and "rawthaw" amusing.
But ,low, I let my baser emotions
carry me away. When "Come Join
the Band" was played by Stanford's
band just beginning a march around
our bonfire, I lost control of myself
sufficiently to follow the rest of the
high-school students and loyal out
siders. Imagine my embarrassment
when I found that I was following
a Stanford band, playing an appro
priate song at a Stanford Rally while
the most of Stanford looked on.
Why haven't the powers-that-be
devoted a little more attention to
plans on such an occasion. For ex
ample, why not sound student spirit

and good taste 'beforehand. If stu
dent opinion says, no, let's not send
our band on a parade especially for
the participation of the interested
outsider and for the amused inter
| est of the Stanford-student specta
i tor. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought
the Bonfire a strictly student cere
-1 mony. Yours sincerely,
James D. Green
