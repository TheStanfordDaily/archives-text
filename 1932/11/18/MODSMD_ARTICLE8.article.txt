# Axe Remains Locked Up After 30-Year Absence
## 
### Bill Newman 
One of the most interesting of
Stanford s traditions is the capture of
the Axe by California and the re
covery by Stanford. Up to 1899 the
| Axe was used by the Cardinal cheer
i leader when he led the "Axe Yell."
; At that time there was no special
| tradition about the Axe save that it
| was very appropriate when the yell
I was used. In that year a number of
j California rooters took the Axe away
| from the Stanford cheer leader and
| returned to Berkeley with it. Ef~
j forts were made to recapture it but
: for thirty years they were in vain.
Foremost among the handicaps of
| having California have the Axe in
! its possession was that they could
answer the "Axe Yell" with "Who's
j Got the Axe?"
Every year the California rooters
I had what was known as an Axe
| Rnlly. At that time I he Axe was

i taken from its resting place in a ;
Berkeley bank and gloated over by ,
| the Bears. In that almost every year |
j there were raids by Stanford men, i
i close guard was kept over the tro
phy by the Californians. The fresh- !
j men were given the honor of being j
! guards.
I Year after year Stanford efforts to i
I recapture the Axe failed because of j
poor timing or bad breaks. How- j
ever, in the spring of 19130 twenty- |
; one Stanford men managed to out
scheme the guards and make possible i
j the return of the Axe to the Farm. '
These men are now known as the |
j Immortal Twenty-one.
j The Twenty-One had a definite !
1 plan for the seizing of the Axe. They j
were pledged to absolute secrecy and ,
j due to their ability to live up to that
' agreement lies much of their sue- !
