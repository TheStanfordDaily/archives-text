# Axe Remains Locked Up After 30-Year Absence
## 
### Bill Newman 
One of the most interesting of
Stanford s traditions is the capture of
the Axe by California and the re
covery by Stanford. Up to 1899 the
| Axe was used by the Cardinal cheer
i leader when he led the "Axe Yell."
; At that time there was no special
| tradition about the Axe save that it
| was very appropriate when the yell
I was used. In that year a number of
j California rooters took the Axe away
| from the Stanford cheer leader and
| returned to Berkeley with it. Ef~
j forts were made to recapture it but
: for thirty years they were in vain.
Foremost among the handicaps of
| having California have the Axe in
! its possession was that they could
answer the "Axe Yell" with "Who's
j Got the Axe?"
Every year the California rooters
I had what was known as an Axe
| Rnlly. At that time I he Axe was

i taken from its resting place in a ;
Berkeley bank and gloated over by ,
| the Bears. In that almost every year |
j there were raids by Stanford men, i
i close guard was kept over the tro
phy by the Californians. The fresh- !
j men were given the honor of being j
! guards.
I Year after year Stanford efforts to i
I recapture the Axe failed because of j
poor timing or bad breaks. How- j
ever, in the spring of 19130 twenty- |
; one Stanford men managed to out
scheme the guards and make possible i
j the return of the Axe to the Farm. '
These men are now known as the |
j Immortal Twenty-one.
j The Twenty-One had a definite !
1 plan for the seizing of the Axe. They j
were pledged to absolute secrecy and ,
j due to their ability to live up to that
' agreement lies much of their sue- !
They carried out their plans
just as they were outlined.
On the day of the Axe Rally the
Twenty-One sneaked over to the
California campus and mingled with
the students there. They attended
the rally as good Californians and
departed just before the meeting was
over. Several of the number went to
the bank where the Axe was kept
and backed a car onto the sidewalk
as though they were newspaper re
porters seeking an opportunity to
take pictures of the Axe. Several
others actually rode on the ar
moured truck in which the Axe was
transported. They pretended that
they were guards. When the truck
arrived at the bank the Stanford
men who were acting as newspaper
men asked the guards to allow them
to take a picture of the Axe. The
California freshmen who were act
ing as guards withdrew so that they
would not be in the picture. One
Stanford man dashed forward and
seized the Axe; another threw a tear
bomb into the crowd that had gath
ered around; a third started a fight
to attract the crowd's attention. Be
fore the Bears could realize it the
Axe was gone.
Efforts were made to prevent the
return of the trophy to the Stanford
campus, but later when stories were
compared it was found that the Axe
was at the Farm before many of the
California students discovered their
loss.
At Stanford rallies were held all
over the farm. The Axe was stored
in the B.A.C. vault for the night and
was later taken to a bank vault in
Palo Alto where it has, unfortunate
ly, remained ever since.

On the day of the Axe Rally the
Twenty-One sneaked over to the
California campus and mingled with
the students there. They attended
the rally as good Californians and
departed just before the meeting was
over. Several of the number went to
the bank where the Axe was kept
and backed a car onto the sidewalk
as though they were newspaper re
porters seeking an opportunity to
take pictures of the Axe. Several
others actually rode on the ar
moured truck in which the Axe was
transported. They pretended that
they were guards. When the truck
arrived at the bank the Stanford
men who were acting as newspaper
men asked the guards to allow them
to take a picture of the Axe. The
California freshmen who were act
ing as guards withdrew so that they
would not be in the picture. One
Stanford man dashed forward and
seized the Axe; another threw a tear
bomb into the crowd that had gath
ered around; a third started a fight
to attract the crowd's attention. Be
fore the Bears could realize it the
Axe was gone.
Efforts were made to prevent the
return of the trophy to the Stanford
campus, but later when stories were
compared it was found that the Axe
was at the Farm before many of the
California students discovered their
loss.
At Stanford rallies were held all
over the farm. The Axe was stored
in the B.A.C. vault for the night and
was later taken to a bank vault in
Palo Alto where it has, unfortunate
ly, remained ever since.

One of the most interesting of
Stanford s traditions is the capture of
the Axe by California and the re
covery by Stanford. Up to 1899 the
| Axe was used by the Cardinal cheer
i leader when he led the "Axe Yell."
; At that time there was no special
| tradition about the Axe save that it
| was very appropriate when the yell
I was used. In that year a number of
j California rooters took the Axe away
| from the Stanford cheer leader and
| returned to Berkeley with it. Ef~
j forts were made to recapture it but
: for thirty years they were in vain.
Foremost among the handicaps of
| having California have the Axe in
! its possession was that they could
answer the "Axe Yell" with "Who's
j Got the Axe?"
Every year the California rooters
I had what was known as an Axe

i taken from its resting place in a ;
Berkeley bank and gloated over by ,

j there were raids by Stanford men, i
i close guard was kept over the tro
phy by the Californians. The fresh- !
j men were given the honor of being j
! guards.
I Year after year Stanford efforts to i
I recapture the Axe failed because of j
poor timing or bad breaks. How- j

scheme the guards and make possible i
j the return of the Axe to the Farm. '
