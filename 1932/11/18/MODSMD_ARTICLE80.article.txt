# WHO'S MIND?

j The Editor, Sir:
Stanford certainly can be proud
|of her Daily. What's the matter—
I can't you make up your mind? The
| day we Frosh began the building
jof the pyre there was an editorial
j in the paper to the effect that "the
bonfire isn't necessary—don't build
it." Thus discouraging the Frosh,
who think that, "Well, maybe we'd
better not build it. The Daily knows
more about it than we do." After
breaking down the Frosh spirit,
what do you do but "pan" vis for
the size of the pyre. Every day,
from the time the editorial was
printed till the fire was set off, there
was some comment "slamming" us
for our lack of spirit. Even the Palo
| Alto Times picked up tie idea and
I had a few remarks aboi the small
size of the pyre. As a climax, after
"panning" us for a week, we find
in this morning's Daily an editorial
very similar to the original, asking
us why we built it and telling us
that we shouldn't have. And then
you wonder where all the Frosh
spirit has gone.
Is that nice?
