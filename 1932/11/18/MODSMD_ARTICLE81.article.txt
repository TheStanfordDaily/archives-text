# CINDER SPORTS TO DRAW PLAYERS AS GRID SEASON ENDS
## 
### 
The end of football season follow
ing the Pittsburgh-Stanford game a
week after tomorrow's big game will
release six prominent and promis
ing men for the traek team that is ,
now getting up its early season |
steam. With these men, the trans- !
fers who have turned out for the
cinder squad, and the varsity mate- i
rial developing from last year's var- |
sity and freshman squads Stanford l
promises a good all-around team.
When the pigskin art relinquishes
its hold and goes into hibernation,
Here Laborde, who took second in
the Olympics in the discus, will ,
gladden the hearts of Dink Temple- ,
ton, head coach, and Bill Ellington,
assistant-coach. Laborde ought to
lead the discus for Stanford and is
a shot-put stand-by always good for
a distant toss. In the weights will j
also be Phil Johnston and Ed Luttu- I
nich, who was the frosh shot-putter
last season. Johnny Lyman and i
Nellie Gray make this the team's j
strongest event.
440 Competitors
Chuck White, who ran the 440 for j
Ihe '34 frosh varsity, and Bill Sim, ,
who was Sacramento Junior Col- '
lege's quarter-mile man, will take j
off their football uniforms in favor j
of track outfits. They will immedi- !
ately run into hard competition with ;
a fast 440 field already out. Captain '
Ben Eastman has not been running .
this, his favorite event, yet. A1 :
Blackmail beat out his brother Don j
in last Friday's practice track meet j
in 51 flat.
In the pole vault Buck Van Del- |
len may turn out. However, he tore .
the ligaments in his knee in football
and may be too tied-up for this ac- ;
tivity. With Bill Miller, Olympic
champion, on the squad it will not
be weak there, and George Edmonds
pulled through with an 11-foot jump
in the Friday meet, two weeks ago. ,
Hurdle Possibilities
Possibilities elsewhere, in the high
hurdles particularly, look fine. Gus
Meier has already run the obstacle
infested stretch in an even 15 sec
onds. Dave Packard, who performed
remarkably in this event two years
ago and of whom Ellington expects
great things, will turn out after foot
ball season it is hoped. He may
play basketball for a while, but will
eventually strengthen this already
strong event.
The mile, the 100-yard dash, the
low hurdles, and the high jump look
well this early in the season. In the
mile Norm Bright sped around the
track in 4:30.5 in spite of shinsplints
and little practice. Jim Ferrie took
second in good time and the two of
them make a strong pair.
Eastman Runs 100
Captain Eastman traveled the 100-
yard cinder path in 10.1 seconds a
week ago and was tagged plenty
closely by Art Rice, a transfer who
is changing from a good 440 man to
a better sprinter. It is doubtful that
Eastman wil lmake this and the 220
dash his events. That will leave
Rice to hold the position against
Jimmy Willson and Ward.
Making a good showing for this
time of year Cotto Herbert skim
med the low hurdle strip in 23.3 sec
onds followed closely by Meier and
LaMonte.
Arthur Jumps 6'2"
The high jump too looks as if its
on the up and up. Howard Arthur,
transfer from Washington, has
jumped 6 feet in two practice track
meets and bounded over the bar at
(! feet 2 inches in daily practice. He
is the strongest varsity man in this
event. In last week's track meet two
freshmen took the next two places
tying at 5 feet 10 inches.
The javelin throw is going well for
this early in the season. Dave Brown
sailed the steel-tipped sliver through
the air for a distance of 182 feet
even. This event is usually weak
at this time of year but that toss
would seem to say that the usual
will not occur next season.
Lew Hichman, captain and half
hack of the Ohio State football team,
is writing signed articles for the Ohio
State Lantern, university newspa
per.
Ernie Nevers of Stanford handled
the ball in every play in the football
games he look part in for three years.
