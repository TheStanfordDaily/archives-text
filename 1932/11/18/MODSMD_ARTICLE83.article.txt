# BASEBALL MENTOR SPENT TEN YEARS WITH BIG LEAGUES
## Coach Wolter Played With Yank, Cub Teams 
### Howard Moore 
Ever since the day he succeeded
in throwing his rattle on a bee-line
through a small nursery window at j
an annoying blue-jay, little Harry
Wolter knew he was destined to be
a ball player. Now. in his tenth j
year as coach of Stanford baseball
varsities, Wolter looks back on a life
connected throughout with Ameri- i
ca's grand old pastime.
Ten consecutive years in the big
leagues and a scattering of months ,
here and years there with minor
league and semi-pro outfits plus |
years of sand-lot, high school and
college ball is the playing record of j
the veteran Indian mentor.
Signs With Fresno
After the 1906 earthquake shook 1
him out of Santa Clara, to use his j
own words, he entered the Pacific
Coast League, signing up with Fres
no, formerly the Tacoma Club.
In 1909 he achieved his ambition !
when the Boston R«d Sox picked
him up to pitch for them. Wolter j
only pitched ten games that year, j
but he played in 110. His hitting >
ability and fast base-running made j
him too valuable to waste on the !
bench taking his turn on the mound, j
so he was used in the outfield.
Sold to Yanks
The next year he was sold to the
New York Yankees and the next
four or five years saw him galli- j
vanting around the Polo Grounds, j
He played in a Boston-New York
city series shortly after the Red Sox j
acquired Babe Ruth as a pitcher, but j
he stoutly denies ever having been j
struck out by that portly all-time |
baseball star.
After his years with the Yanks, i
Wolter went to the Chicago Cubs :
until 1919 when a broken leg forced i
him out of big-time action. His first |
thought was the West and he was |
soon seen playing for San Fran- :
cisco, again in the Coast League, i
After a year or so there, a position ;
in an oil company led him to Ba- j
kersfield, and to kill time he spent a i
couple of years shagging flies for |
Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Val- I
ley League.
Comes to Stanford
In 1923 he retired from active I
competition to come to Stanford, 1

one spring in 1914 before returning
to play for the Yankees.
Wolter remembers many of the
bright lights of baseball during the j
past few years. Christy Matthewson
was pitching for the Giants in his
day, but outside of one or two exhi
bition games between the Yanks
and Giants, the Card mentor never
saw much of the great pitcher. He
denies ever having taken three
strikes from the great Matty either.
While toiling for the Yanks, he
played against Chief Bender, Eddie
Plank and "Home-Run" Baker of
the world-champion Philadelphia
Athletics. This time he admitted
having been retired several times
via the strike-out route by the re
doubtables, Plank and Bender.
Joins Cubs
He joined the Cubs too late to
play with the famous Tinker-Evers-
Chance combination, but had many
a game against such famous players
as Eddie Collins, Ty Cobb, Tris
Speaker, and Eddie Schalk. Grover
Cleveland Alexander was on the
Cubs when he joined. He batted
many times against Walter Johnson,
notable Washington h.urler and re
cent manager for the Senators.
"Poor old Walter," the Stanford
coach reminisced the other day, "we
I used to beat him easy as pie, somC
i times ... 1 to 0."
Goes to Red Sox
Wolter went up to the Red Sox
I with Harry Hooper, a Saint Mary's

graduate now living in Capitola,
and Duffy Lewis, a former Alameda
High youngster and later manager
of the Salt Lake team in the Coast
League. Harry Hooper was fortunate
enough to stick with the Sox and
get into the World's Series in 1914.
Wolter never had the opportunity j
to play in the big blow-off for any ,
team.
"Harry was one of the fastest men 1
in the Big Leagues until he broke
his leg," his old friend and baseball
enthusiast Ed. R. Hughes, San Fran
cisco sports writer, was saying the
other day, "and although he was es
sentially a pitcher, he saw a lot of
action in the outfield and was a bet
ter than average first-baseman.
It is a little-known fact that polo,
a game of the ancient Persians, was
invented by Chinese women.

Ever since the day he succeeded

varsities, Wolter looks back on a life
connected throughout with Ameri- i
ca's grand old pastime.
Ten consecutive years in the big
leagues and a scattering of months ,

years of sand-lot, high school and

the veteran Indian mentor.
Signs With Fresno
After the 1906 earthquake shook 1
him out of Santa Clara, to use his j
own words, he entered the Pacific
Coast League, signing up with Fres
no, formerly the Tacoma Club.
In 1909 he achieved his ambition !
when the Boston R«d Sox picked
him up to pitch for them. Wolter j
only pitched ten games that year, j
but he played in 110. His hitting >
ability and fast base-running made j
him too valuable to waste on the !
bench taking his turn on the mound, j
so he was used in the outfield.
Sold to Yanks
The next year he was sold to the
New York Yankees and the next
four or five years saw him galli- j
vanting around the Polo Grounds, j
He played in a Boston-New York
city series shortly after the Red Sox j
acquired Babe Ruth as a pitcher, but j
he stoutly denies ever having been j
struck out by that portly all-time |
baseball star.
After his years with the Yanks, i
Wolter went to the Chicago Cubs :
until 1919 when a broken leg forced i
him out of big-time action. His first |
thought was the West and he was |
soon seen playing for San Fran- :
cisco, again in the Coast League, i
After a year or so there, a position ;
in an oil company led him to Ba- j
kersfield, and to kill time he spent a i
couple of years shagging flies for |
Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Val- I
ley League.
Comes to Stanford
In 1923 he retired from active I
competition to come to Stanford, 1

one spring in 1914 before returning
to play for the Yankees.
Wolter remembers many of the
bright lights of baseball during the j
past few years. Christy Matthewson
was pitching for the Giants in his
day, but outside of one or two exhi
bition games between the Yanks
and Giants, the Card mentor never
saw much of the great pitcher. He
denies ever having taken three
strikes from the great Matty either.
While toiling for the Yanks, he
played against Chief Bender, Eddie
Plank and "Home-Run" Baker of
the world-champion Philadelphia
Athletics. This time he admitted
having been retired several times
via the strike-out route by the re
doubtables, Plank and Bender.
Joins Cubs
He joined the Cubs too late to
play with the famous Tinker-Evers-
Chance combination, but had many
a game against such famous players
as Eddie Collins, Ty Cobb, Tris
Speaker, and Eddie Schalk. Grover
Cleveland Alexander was on the
Cubs when he joined. He batted
many times against Walter Johnson,
notable Washington h.urler and re
cent manager for the Senators.
"Poor old Walter," the Stanford
coach reminisced the other day, "we
I used to beat him easy as pie, somC
i times ... 1 to 0."
Goes to Red Sox
Wolter went up to the Red Sox
I with Harry Hooper, a Saint Mary's

graduate now living in Capitola,
and Duffy Lewis, a former Alameda
High youngster and later manager
of the Salt Lake team in the Coast
League. Harry Hooper was fortunate
enough to stick with the Sox and
get into the World's Series in 1914.
Wolter never had the opportunity j
to play in the big blow-off for any ,
team.
"Harry was one of the fastest men 1
in the Big Leagues until he broke
his leg," his old friend and baseball
enthusiast Ed. R. Hughes, San Fran
cisco sports writer, was saying the
other day, "and although he was es
sentially a pitcher, he saw a lot of
action in the outfield and was a bet
ter than average first-baseman.

It is a little-known fact that polo,
a game of the ancient Persians, was
invented by Chinese women.
Ever since the day he succeeded
in throwing his rattle on a bee-line
through a small nursery window at j
an annoying blue-jay, little Harry
Wolter knew he was destined to be
a ball player. Now. in his tenth j
year as coach of Stanford baseball
varsities, Wolter looks back on a life
connected throughout with Ameri- i
ca's grand old pastime.
Ten consecutive years in the big
leagues and a scattering of months ,
here and years there with minor
league and semi-pro outfits plus |
years of sand-lot, high school and
college ball is the playing record of j
the veteran Indian mentor.
Signs With Fresno
After the 1906 earthquake shook 1
him out of Santa Clara, to use his j
own words, he entered the Pacific
Coast League, signing up with Fres
no, formerly the Tacoma Club.
In 1909 he achieved his ambition !
when the Boston R«d Sox picked
him up to pitch for them. Wolter j
only pitched ten games that year, j
but he played in 110. His hitting >
ability and fast base-running made j
him too valuable to waste on the !
bench taking his turn on the mound, j
so he was used in the outfield.
Sold to Yanks
The next year he was sold to the
New York Yankees and the next
four or five years saw him galli- j
vanting around the Polo Grounds, j
He played in a Boston-New York
city series shortly after the Red Sox j
acquired Babe Ruth as a pitcher, but j
he stoutly denies ever having been j
struck out by that portly all-time |
baseball star.
After his years with the Yanks, i
Wolter went to the Chicago Cubs :
until 1919 when a broken leg forced i
him out of big-time action. His first |
thought was the West and he was |
soon seen playing for San Fran- :
cisco, again in the Coast League, i
After a year or so there, a position ;
in an oil company led him to Ba- j
kersfield, and to kill time he spent a i
couple of years shagging flies for |
Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Val- I
ley League.
Comes to Stanford
In 1923 he retired from active I
competition to come to Stanford, 1

one spring in 1914 before returning
to play for the Yankees.
Wolter remembers many of the
bright lights of baseball during the j
past few years. Christy Matthewson
was pitching for the Giants in his
day, but outside of one or two exhi
bition games between the Yanks
and Giants, the Card mentor never
saw much of the great pitcher. He
denies ever having taken three
strikes from the great Matty either.
While toiling for the Yanks, he
played against Chief Bender, Eddie
Plank and "Home-Run" Baker of
the world-champion Philadelphia
Athletics. This time he admitted
having been retired several times
via the strike-out route by the re
doubtables, Plank and Bender.
Joins Cubs
He joined the Cubs too late to
play with the famous Tinker-Evers-
Chance combination, but had many
a game against such famous players
as Eddie Collins, Ty Cobb, Tris
Speaker, and Eddie Schalk. Grover
Cleveland Alexander was on the
Cubs when he joined. He batted
many times against Walter Johnson,
notable Washington h.urler and re
cent manager for the Senators.
"Poor old Walter," the Stanford
coach reminisced the other day, "we
I used to beat him easy as pie, somC
i times ... 1 to 0."
Goes to Red Sox
Wolter went up to the Red Sox
I with Harry Hooper, a Saint Mary's

graduate now living in Capitola,
and Duffy Lewis, a former Alameda
High youngster and later manager
of the Salt Lake team in the Coast
League. Harry Hooper was fortunate
enough to stick with the Sox and
get into the World's Series in 1914.
Wolter never had the opportunity j
to play in the big blow-off for any ,
team.
"Harry was one of the fastest men 1
in the Big Leagues until he broke
his leg," his old friend and baseball
enthusiast Ed. R. Hughes, San Fran
cisco sports writer, was saying the
other day, "and although he was es
sentially a pitcher, he saw a lot of
action in the outfield and was a bet
ter than average first-baseman.
