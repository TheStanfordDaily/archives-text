Last Saturday before Thanksgiv
ing!
In warlime they call it the "Zero j
Hour"—playwrights dulj it the cli- |
max. Football men all over the !
country call it "Big Game Day." Not j
just one Big Game, but hundreds of .
Big Games cover the country's grid- j
iron tomorrow afternoon.
Harvard-Yale
Harvard-Yale head the list—theirs |
is the oldest football rivalry in the j
country. II was from the crude be- j
winnings of a Crimson-Eli "mob [
light" that the elements of the grid- j
iron sport were evolved. As usual ■
Harvard and Yale have both been (
defeated — their season low spot:; j
were bad ones indeed:
Army 40, Harvard 0.
Bates 0, Yale 0.
But the loss of preliminary games
never dims the glamor of this "Big j
Game."
Stanford and California's rivalry,)
which began in 1892, has produced i
intense competition over a long pe- !
riod of years. With but few excep
tions, Indian-Bear battles have been
close, savagely-fought affairs. Out
of each renewal u' iscs some obscure !
player who becomes the Pacific j
Coast's football hero for the year.
Eastern Game
Western Pennsylvania's Big Game !
features Pittsburgh and Carnegie
Tech.
In the Midwest Michigan's tradi
tional battle with Minnesota, and
Purdue's "Big Game" with Indiana
assume championship importance.
The undefeated and untied Wolver- !
ines will play their hardest game of |
the season against the Gophers. Ii j
Michigan loses (quite conceivable),
and Purdue defeats Indiana, the Big
Ten championship will go lo Pur
due's Boilermakers.
Auburn Undefeated
Alabama Polytechnic Institute of j
Auburn meets its last serious ob- |
stacle to the Southern Conference j
title in the University of Georgia.
Tulane plays weak Sewanee, but the '
contest is still a Big Game —so is
Duke's tussle with North Carolina,
and Rice's attempt to upset Texas
Christian's Southwest Conference |
aspirations.
Yale-Harvard, Stanford - Califor- j
nia, even Whitman-Willamette. It !
makes no difference which of the |
many pairs of teams playing tomor- I
row.
It's the Big Game!
