# BRUINS BALKED BY THREE HARD TITLE BATTLES
## Trojans Have Only Single Conference Game Left On 1932 Schedule 
### 
With hut five more games remain
ing in Pacific Coast Conference play
for 1932, U.C.L.A., playing three of
these encounters, finds itself holding j
the key to the entire situation, and j
having an awfully good chance to j
capture the championship.
Montana, facing the Bruins tomor- j
row, should furnish no real opposi
tion, but the game on Thanksgiving

with Washington State and the
Washington affair on December 3 are
tough obstacles. Should U.C.L.A.
win all three games, they will have !
six games won, none lost and will
certainly deserve a tie for top honors
in the league.
U.S.C. has but one more hurdle to I
clear before the end of the Confer- !
ence season, which, if overcome, will 1
give the Trojans six wins without a j
defeat. Washington will furnish the
I opposition, playing the Trojans a
I week before they play the Bruins.
I For the second time in as many
' years, the California-Stanford game
j will have no bearing whatsoever on
j the final standings. A Stanford vic
| tory would give the Indians a tie
: with the Bears in percentage, with
i two games won and three lost, while
j a Bear, victory would shove Stanford
j down into a tie for next to last place
| with Coach Leo Calland's Idaho
j Vandals, the lowest position a Stan
! ford team has ever occupied.
[ To assume the impossible that
J Washington will beat U.S.C., the
j Conference race might be thrown
I into quite a turmoil, particularly if
I the dopesters are right in predicting
j a Washington State win over U.C.-
jL A. This would throw first place
: into somewhat of a triple tie between
! the Cougars, the Bruins (if they beat
j Washington), and tho Trojans.
