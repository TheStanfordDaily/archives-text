# CARD SOCCERMEN CLOSE SEASON IN GAME TOMORROW
## 
### Maurice Rapf 
Opening festivities on Big Game
| day will feature a soccer game bc
! tween the University of California
i eleven and the coachless Stanford
| crew. The encounter will be played
I on the very much sloped surface of
j Hildcgardc field jit Berkeley, and
j will start about 10 o'clock tomorrow
I morning.
Aside from the fact that it is the
| last and deciding tilt of the 1932
j Card-Bear series, it is also the last
game of the season for both squads.
A Stanford win or tie would give the
series to the Palo Alto eleven, while
I a Bear victory would leave the sitâ€”
! uation slightly tied up.
In contrast to the undefeated sea-
I son of last year's championship
! Stanford outfit, the team can hardly
claim a successful season. Two one
goal victories over San Jose State
and onC over California is all that
can be chalked up in the winning
, column. Defeats were had at the
hands of San Mateo and San Fran
| cisco, which two squads also played
tie games with the Cards.
California's season has been even
more disheartening. A victory over
San Jose State is the only thing they
have to their credit, unless it be the
0-0 tie played with Stanford last
Wednesday.
With Coach Hairy Maloney on his
way to New York to attend the
A.A.U. convenlion, Captain Erwin
Brekelbaum and Manager R. D.
; Wade, Jr. will supervise the team,
i According to present plans, the sen
ior members of the team will start
the game, with the regular first
' string outfit going in after the first
I few minutes.
Chief among the switches in the
first string line-up is the placing of
i Art Hearn, regular center, at outside
right. Cy Johnson will therefore
move over to center forward, with
Sven Dodington at inside right and
Carl Knecht, inside left.
Twenty-two members of the squad
will leave this morning at 7:45
| o'clock on a special bus.
j If the cells of the lungs were
i spread out fiat they would cover
I 480 square feet.
