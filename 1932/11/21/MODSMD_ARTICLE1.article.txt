# INDIANS, BEARS PLAY SAVAGELY TO STALEMATE
## Caddel, Sim, Hillman Take Ball To 2-Yard Line In First Quarter CARDS REACH PEAK Final Gun Finds Pigskin On Indian 7-Yard Line 
### Bob Wade 
Seventy-eight thousand tense,
howling spectators rose to their feet
and shook the surrounding hills, as
Stanford marched to within scoring
distance in the initial period at
Berkeley, Saturday, and as the
Bears drove 62 yards in the closing
minutes of play, in one of the great
est scoreless battles ever seen on
the Pacific Coast.
Putting 011 by far their best game
of the year, the Indians fought
themselves out in Bear territory for
three periods, and then managed to

Thirty-four players, accom
panied by eight staff members,
left Palo Alto at 3 o'clock yes
terday afternoon in three special
cars bound for Pittsburgh and
Stanford's last game of the sea
son. The grid members were:
Colvin, Doub, Tod, Monsalve,
Packard, Minckler, Grey, La
horde, Palamountain, Gribben, C.
Rogers, Corbus, Kite, Holwerda,
Mai no, Targhetta, O'Connor, Al

Anderson, Stevens.

muster just enough strength to re
pel the frantie drive of the Cali
fornia eleven which ended on the
7-yard line as the final gun saved
Stanford from what looked like cer
tain defeat.
Cad del Slips Away
The Indians took the opening
kickoff to their own 35-yard marker.
Caddel sliced off -32 yards around
right end on the first play, and
Stanford was off to the races before
the Bears knew they were in a
game. Caddel, Sim, Hillman—they
took turns beating a surprised Bear,
until Sim dashed around left end
into the open, only to stumble on
the 2-yard stripe when he tried to
dive through Williams. He took ihe
ball over, but his knee had touched
the ground for a fraction of a sec
ond, and Stanford couldn't put it
over.
From then until Ingram's boys put
on their almost-Garrison finish, it
was a punting duel between Sim
and Williams, Anderson arid Schal
dach.
Concentrate on Defense
Both teams played gi'eat defensive
football. But they were both so
afraid that they would fumble and
let the other team turn it into the
winning score that they kicked on
third down almost continually, and
seldom let the ball get away from
the halfbacks.
As far as aerial ofTense went,
neither team could show anything
worthy of the name. Stanford
couldn't give the passer time to get
his man located, and the Bears
couldn't get a receiver where the
ball went.
But ihe 78,000 fans, who were
beginning to wonder when the fire
works started, went completely in
sane when Schaldach punted out on
the Stanford three-yard line with
five minutes to play. The Indians
tried once at the line and picked up
two yards.
Schaldach Stages Last Fight
And then, with the Bears howling
for a blocked kick, Stan Anderson
booted the ball from behind his own
goal-line to the California 35-yard
