WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (/P)—A
group of organized drys, in a state
ment tonight, said they "Do not
acknowledge the recent election as
a verdict of the people on prohi
bition."
The statement was signed by F.
Scott Mcßride, superintendent of the
Anti-Saloon League; Dr. Clarence
True Wilson, of the Methodist Board
of Temperance, Prohibition and
Public Morals, and Miss Izora Scott,
of the Women's Christian Temper
ance Union.
"Politicians had maneuvered the
situation so there was no effective
way in which the drys' vote could
be registered," the statement said.
"There were three ways in which
one could vote wet and no way in
which they could vote dry and ef
fectively express themselves on the
important economic issues."
