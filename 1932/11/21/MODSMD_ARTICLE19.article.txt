# Gaieties Mix Music, Fun To Please Crowd
## Original Skits And Few Old Gags Feature Show 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
A dazzling array of music and
nonsense scintillated across the
Stanford stage Friday night, when
Ram's Head presented the 1932 Big
Game Gaieties to an appreciative
audience.
It was a fast-moving show which
got off to a merry pace that was
well sustained throughout. Much of
the material was ragged, but it was
entei'tainment, and that is what the
Gaieties should provide. The prime
merit of the show was its original
ity, with the number of old gags
reduced to a comparative minimum.
Eph Engleman was easily the hit
of the evening; his personality some
what dimmed his pianistic ability,
which is as undeniable as that of
Grif Williams, with whom he ap
peared. The pair did a unique piano
act, with some plain and fancy
playing.
"Mills Sisters" Popular
The chorus, unsteady at first, im
proved perceptibly in the pictur
esque "Swinging" number, and was
excellent in the two finales. Excel
lent, too, was the comic chorus.
Outstanding for originality and
execution was Berk Anthony's "Liv
ing Statues," which neatly made
fun of Union coffee and the Honor
Code. "The Mills Sisters" act de
served its applause, for it was a
cleverly conceived satire on Mills
girls, with pleasing singing from the
Misses Guild, Maloney, and Mosher.
"The Old Man Takes A Day Off"
("Death Takes a Holiday" to you)
was a subtle burlesque of the recent
campus play, with George Wilson
doing a hilarious Grim Reaper.
Franklin Thomas' stereoptican lec
ture was one of the more insane
sketches, and Winstead Weaver's
hat act was an amusing variation of
an old stunt.
