# Stewart Versatile

### 
An anonymous gentleman billed
as "Twinkletoes" offered an excel
lent Tap number, and Mary Louise
Stewart, good in several sketches,
gave a charming rendition of Dor
othy Bernhardt's pleasing "Heaven's
on the Levee."
The best gag: "Marion Hewlett's
my girl!"
The Lucky Strike take-off was
pictorially the most effective num
ber, with its attractive cast headed
by Barbara Collins, looking more
charming than ever. "The Doll
Shop" number was also a refreshing
bit.
Beulah Dimmitt deserves mention
for her work in "The Inside Story,"
a clever sketch, and in the Roble
drama, not so clever.
Stanford is indebted to the Messrs.
Helvenston, Stover, Heche, Moller,
and Lowry, to Miss Kelly, and to
the entire cast for an evening of
swell entertainment.
