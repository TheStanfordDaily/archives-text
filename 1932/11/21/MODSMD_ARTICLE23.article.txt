\ THOUSAND DOLLARS for Stanford Student Relief.
** To combat the real hunger for something to eat. the need of trvl
books, the lack of jackets, the small but sharp financial goads that put a
bitter edge to Stanford campus life—to combat these must be found one
thousand dollars.
An All-University Carnival, elaborately staged by the Five Hundred,
backed by the Ex Committee, urged by the two Deans' offices, and ap
proved by the Administration, sets this goal on December 3.
Senior, junior, sophomore, and freshman women, plus all women's
organizations, will work as units in staging the carnival under the headship

of the Student Relief Committed
whose strategic trio is Helen UU
mann, Ann Rosener, and Phyllis
Doane.
Bigger than ever mount this year's
plans, to make stalwart the hope
I for $1000 revenue. Two years ago
I j the carnival netted $900, spent by
II the women toward a proposed
| $20,000 furnishing of their new gym.
j With last year's thoughts turned
|; to student relief, the Carnival
j brought $400, disappointing the
| women's ambition by several hun-
I dred dollars.

Need Desperate
j The need has become so desperate
1 1 this year that unless funds are re
j plenished in the relief bureaus 'of
! i Dean Culver and Dean Yost, the
j campus situation promises to be
j come tragic.
A closed date on December 3 gives
• the Carnival full swing for the eve
ning. At ten cents a dance, the
campus will shuffle to music do
nated by Gordon Heche's orchestra.
Non-paying concessions of former
years have been deleted, with in
> j triguing ideas to replace them. Gold
! fishing, fortune telling, quick-sketch
! caricatures, and games of chance
j wili draw money out of the well-to
i do rough's pocket, as well as colos-
I sal sale of donated food, candy, ciga
rettes, and valuable bric-a-brac.
