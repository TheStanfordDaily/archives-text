Perhaps the psychological oiled of the red jerseys had
something lo do with it. Perhaps it was the reaction after
three defeats in a row. Or, more likely, perhaps it was the
team's regard for its coach, the "Old Man" it worships.
In anv case there was more than just Hig (lame tradi
tion and a desire to humble the Hear behind the fight in
that cardinal-clad team up there at Berkeley Saturday.
And I here was more than mere football in the battle that
was waged.
Almost lo a man, the players that Pop Warner sent onto
the Memorial Stadium turf showed more of what men
indelicately but most expressively term "guts" than any
other Stanford ontlit, football or otherwise, that the pres
ent college generation has ever seen in action.
They came out lighting at the opening whistle lo push
a surprised Hear back 011 his haunches. Thwarted in the
first quarter after coming hcartbreakingly near to scoring,
they fought on lo litter exhaustion against a foe kept fresh
by a steady stream of substitutions. Hruised, weary, broken
in everything but spirit, they slaved oil' the last ferocious
attack of a Hear that had lasted blood and was rushing in
to kill.
A battered crew, the Indians are en route East today.
They go not happy, perhaps, with the emotional jubilance
that follows smashing victory, but calmly satisfied in the
realization that they gave all they had.
May they trounce Pittsburgh!
