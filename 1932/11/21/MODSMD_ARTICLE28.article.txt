One purely local blessing which will accompany the in
auguration of Franklin I). Roosevelt and his Democratic
colleagues next March I will he the return of Hay Lyman
Wilhur to the active presidency of the University. Not
withstanding the admirable executive term of Acting
president Swain, it will be a line thing for Stanford to have
its president, with all his administrative experience and
authority, seated once more at his desk in the Administra
tion building.
Wilbur's return, however, may reopen an old issue of
Stanford's educational program, an issue which has been
hashed and rehashed, settled and resettled, for a decade
the retention or abolition of the Lower Division. Wilbur
gave his okeh to the measure passed by the trustees last
spring which provided for the retention and expansion of
the lower classes, and he has said nothing since which di
rectly indicates that he still harbors the ideal of making
Stanford an institution of strictly "higher and higher" edu
cation. Where, then, does the Daily gel the idea that his
return may signalize the reopening of the old issue? From
the tenor of his recent remarks in welcoming junior college
transfers to the University.
Terming his listeners "pioneers to mold Stanford life,"
Wilbur told the group of junior transfers not to worry
about adjusting themselves to Stanford, that the Univer
sity would' have to adjust itself to them. Well chosen
words, in a hearty speech of welcome which made the
transfers feel that they belong to Stanford but behind
them lurks the possibility that our president may bring
his old plan for Stanford's educational future back from
Washington with him.
For the time being the Daily prefers to believe that
Wilbur's remarks to the transfers were merely a nicely
constructed pep talk, and that they did not reflect the presi
dent's future administrative policy. Regardless of the ab
stract merit of the no-Lower Division plan, Wilbur must
realize that students and alumni do not like it.
