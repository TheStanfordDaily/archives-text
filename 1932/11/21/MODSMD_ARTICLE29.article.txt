II certainly is time lor a Helvenston edit. What with
Iho (iaiotios as good as they wore, and with the new and
interesting Lynn Ilelvonston arriviitg amid the loud
chipping of Mr. Stork's wings early Friday morning, Stan
ford's young director can scarcely he overlooked.
Already ho lias received public congratulations both
on the birth of his daughter and on the worth of his show,
and rightly. The audience which applauded so often at
Friday night's performance realized how successfully the
Gaieties had achieved its end that of being a boisterous,
happy, humorous show. And Director Harold's ability to
smooth a lot of amateurs into a coherent unit is of course
responsible.
Not the least praiseworthy of 1 lelvenston's Gaieties
policies in past years has been the one of putting as many
people as he possibly could in the show. This lime he
slipped up a little, il seemed, because there were three or
four faces that showed pretty often. Hut this is a very
minor squawk, and well obscured bv the excellence of the
linished product.
