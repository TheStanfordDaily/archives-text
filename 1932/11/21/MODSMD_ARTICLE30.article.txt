# BULL SESSION
## WHY STAY SOBER? 
### 
The evils of liquor have been
paraded before the eyes of the
young for years—both before and
since the much-lamented demise of
J. Barleycorn. And now that Hearst
and the Du Ponts are about to pull
a "Lazarus arose" act with the old
fellow, we can expect the crusade
against "demon rum" to be renewed
with increased fury.
And while such educational pro
grams are probably commendable
and worthwhile, it is only right in
the interests of honesty to present
the other side—the disadvantages of
staying sober, with special empha
sis on Big Game night.
As the slightly aged alcohol be
gins permeating the crowd, ihey, of
course, react to it. And as they be
come sogged and gin-logged, they
sink from the piane that we dignify
with the word—normalcy. Those
who refuse to hit the shellacked
slide are of necessity left sitting on
a higher plane. From here, they can
see the rest acting in a decidedly
puerile manner.
The drunken conversation is un
usually prolific — unusually loud —
and of course uncontrolled. From
this presumption, people somehow
hold that the conversation was
witty. The rest of the inebriated
laughed loudly and reasoning by
reverse English from result to
cause-«~they come to the conclusion
that the babbling must have been
cleverly humorous. What would be
mere obvious vulgarisms in sobriety
are dignified as racy and keen in
drunkenness.
All this is painfully clear and evi

, dent to the one who stays sober. He
! cannot help feeling an overwhelm
ing pity as well as disgust for the
whole show. This makes him feel
: like the grandfather's clock in an
1 alarm clock factory— out of place
1 and uncomfortable. Very likely the
sober one is apt to get mildly philo
j sophical as well as painfully so
j ciological and boringly psychologi
cal. And the philosophical-moralist
! complex is not in accord with a so
! cial evening.
I —
Also, the poor person who has
failed to sluff'off his inhibitions in
! a pitcher of cocktails is at a total
! loss Monday morning when the tell—
! ing of Saturday night exploits is in
; order. The most exciting sober eve
jning never approaches the story
| telling possibilities of a good drunk.
{The one who stays sober is abso-
I lutely out of the picture conversa

j of Tuesday too.
Along with these semi-intangible
disadvantages of the social drag of

j conversational ostracism—is the very
I mundane but very annoying diffi
culty of keeping care of the drunks.

get home soundly and do not end
; up hanging limply on lamp-posts or
! jail cots. The divine hand seems to

■ sober one of course doesn't. seem
| able to trust the Father in heaven.
And of course the answer to all
; these absolutely uncontrovertible
! facts is "What- do YOU know?"

The evils of liquor have been
paraded before the eyes of the
young for years—both before and
since the much-lamented demise of
J. Barleycorn. And now that Hearst
and the Du Ponts are about to pull
a "Lazarus arose" act with the old
fellow, we can expect the crusade
against "demon rum" to be renewed
with increased fury.
And while such educational pro
grams are probably commendable
and worthwhile, it is only right in
the interests of honesty to present
the other side—the disadvantages of
staying sober, with special empha
sis on Big Game night.
As the slightly aged alcohol be
gins permeating the crowd, ihey, of
course, react to it. And as they be
come sogged and gin-logged, they
sink from the piane that we dignify
with the word—normalcy. Those
who refuse to hit the shellacked
slide are of necessity left sitting on
a higher plane. From here, they can
see the rest acting in a decidedly
puerile manner.
The drunken conversation is un
usually prolific — unusually loud —
and of course uncontrolled. From
this presumption, people somehow
hold that the conversation was
witty. The rest of the inebriated
laughed loudly and reasoning by
reverse English from result to
cause-«~they come to the conclusion
that the babbling must have been
cleverly humorous. What would be
mere obvious vulgarisms in sobriety
are dignified as racy and keen in
drunkenness.
All this is painfully clear and evi

, dent to the one who stays sober. He
! cannot help feeling an overwhelm
ing pity as well as disgust for the
whole show. This makes him feel
: like the grandfather's clock in an
1 alarm clock factory— out of place
1 and uncomfortable. Very likely the
sober one is apt to get mildly philo
j sophical as well as painfully so
j ciological and boringly psychologi
cal. And the philosophical-moralist
