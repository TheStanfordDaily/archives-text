THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR: A
Literary newspaper. Edited by
George Jean Nathan, Ernest Boyd,
Theodore Dreiser, James Branch
Cabell, and Eugene O'Neill. (At
the Stanford Bookstore.)
Having looked at the list of con
tributors (Dreiser, O'Neill, Cabell,
Boyd, Nathan, Darrow, Swinnerton,
Krutch, Brooks, Ellis, O'Flaherty,
Lardner, Steffens, Untermeyer, and
Bridges) one reviewer expresses
disappointment in violent terms that
the first issue of The American
Spectator contains so little profound
thought.
I think this reviewer mistakes the
purpose of this harmlessly droll
paper. The contributors have been
asked to write on "what interests
them at the moment"—an indication
of rather gay, immaterial ease.
That the paper contains nothing
profound or startling does not mat
ter; that the contributions, for the
most part well-written trifles, were
amusing, does.
Cabell protests against the wide
eyed American interest in coition,
particularly in relation to his sex
flaunted but otherwise-intended
volumes; Krutch and Boyd com
ment upon corresponding weak
nesses in American criticism and
the attitude of the young aesthete:
a mutual, wavering viewpoint; Un
termeyer laughs at the self-pity of
poetesses of all time; and O'Neill
writing of masks, observes that they
are destined to be liberators of the
drama. •—Sandoe
