# THE 						STATE OF VAUDEVILLE
## 
### 
The reception of even a bad
vaudeville act makes mysterious the
fall of that once so popular amuse
ment. At the Stanford Theatre last
Saturday evening, of four acts only
one was 'amusing, the others were
routine work, colorless or vulgar;
yet all were heartily applauded.
And it is hardly amazing that

j audiences should prefer the aged
: jokes made by real persons on a
| stage to the same jokes cracked by
! tremendous shadows in a back
| ground somewhat more interesting
1 than the old street corner drop, but
|in themselves incapable of adding
| tremendously to the effect of the
| humor.
The talking pictures and elabor
| ate stage shows may have hurt the
| two-a-day for a time, but if old
1 gags will go as far on the stage as
j they did the other evening, there is
ino reason why vaudeville should
continue quiescent. There are, to be
sure, a limited number of things to
do—but this same limitation applies
.to stage and screen alike. The re
cent hundredth repetition of the-
I white-man-in-the-tropics known as
] Red Dust and its Broadway kin of
| last season, whose name does not
j matter, prove that conclusively.
For that matter, it is doubtful that
I vaudeville is as dead as has been
j asserted. It is interesting to note
that the most consistently profitable
| theatre in San Francisco is its one
remaining variety house.
