| COLOR BLINDNESS
i News item—"Blue eyes are really
colorless, biological research has re
vealed. They are like the blue sky.
In fact, neither the blue sky, nor
blue eyes, are blue. It is just a mat
ter of reflected light that causes one
to see in them that restful color."
Sweet girl, those eyes of yours
of heavenly hue,
In view of what the learned men
now claim,
Are not, as I once said, "divinely
blue,"
But colorless as Smith is for a
name.
•
Those poems I wrote to "stolen
summer skies"
Now make me seem so foolish,
but I say—
| How did I know your orbs were
in disguise
And that your blue eyes merely
"look that way?"
And after March 4, wonders the
Old Medic, will Harvard have to
take on the polite political mumness
that Stanford maintained during the
past four years?
"In old California there was a
town where they used to hang folks
early and often. They named the
place 'Hangtown,' and under that
name it became world-famous. And
so, today, San Francisco might have
a new name, but for a slightly dif
ferent reason. After last night (Big
Game night) it might, with all pro
priety, be called: "Hangovertown!"
