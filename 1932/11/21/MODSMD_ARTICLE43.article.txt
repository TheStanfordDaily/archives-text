# Card Soccermen Flash to 4-1 Win in Season's Finale
## CALIFORNIA SQUAD BADLY BEATEN AS INDIANS HIT PEAK Forwards Show Teamwork In Tilt At Berkeley; Take U.C. Series 
### Maurice Rapf 
It took the last game of the sea
son to bring out all that was good
Ihe Stanford soccer team, and
in at "good" was just enough to de
feat'a California varsity 4-1 on its
own home grounds last Saturday
morning, the same California var
sity that had held Stanford to a
scoreless tie last Wednesday.
Stanford needed the victory; it
decided the outcome of this year's
series with the Bears. With the first
game won and the second game
tied, however, the Cards may feel
that they made somewhat of a clean
sweep. The absence of Coach Harry
Maloney at Saturday's game was the
only thing that robbed the situation
of the complete feeling of satisfac
tion that should have accompanied
such a convincing victory.

There wasn't much doubt about
the fact that the team looked good,
but just what it was that caused
this sudden show of iorm cannot be
determined. It certainly wasn't be
cause of favorable playing condi
tions. Hildegarde Field, the scene
of the tilt, is no bargain, unless it
be for Alpine climbers who enjoy
running uphill half the time, and
sliding down the slope for the rest
of the morning.
At any rate, the forwards, long
the missing link in the team's solid
ity, showed some teamwork. They
passed the ball accurately and there
was none of the "ball-hogging" that
has been so prevalent in other
games. If Art Hearn couldn't get
through the opposing halfbacks him
self, he passed the ball to Gas
Rojas or Cy Johnson, and if they
couldn't get anywhere with it, they
sent it to Wataro Sutow, the left
wing. They played as a unit, and
the results make plain the value of
this type of play.

From the v£ry outset, it was evi
dent as to which was the stronger
team. Art Hearn booted one in ten
minutes after the game got under
way, but the ball had constantly
been near the Bear goal. It is true
that Pinto, U.C. inside, threw |a
temporary scare in Stanford's di
rection by tying the score late in
Ihe first quarter, but the even count
was short-lived for, less than a min
ute later, Hearn took a pass from
Johnson and drove it home.
In the second period the score
went to 3-1 when Johnson, oil a
beautiful pass from Carl Knecht,
who played inside left in the best
fashion, kicked the goal from close
quarters. It was Johnson who closed
the morning's scoring with a well
played shot from a difficult angle
in the middle of the third quarter.
Bears (Jet Breaks
California had all the breaks, but
of course, most of them were de
served. The Bears had eight free
kicks to Stanford's one and four
corner kicks to the Cards' two.
These kicks seldom result in
scores, however, and figures show
that in direct boots at the goal
Indians had a decided edge. John
son led in scoring attempts, driving
seven shots goalward, while the
team's total was 19. California had
only eight chances.
Buster Holmes, who acted in Ma
loney's place as coach of the team,
should be commended for the fine
manner in which he handled the
players. Twenty-three men com
peted for Stanford.

From the v£ry outset, it was evi
dent as to which was the stronger
team. Art Hearn booted one in ten
minutes after the game got under
way, but the ball had constantly
been near the Bear goal. It is true
that Pinto, U.C. inside, threw |a
temporary scare in Stanford's di
rection by tying the score late in
Ihe first quarter, but the even count
was short-lived for, less than a min
ute later, Hearn took a pass from
Johnson and drove it home.
In the second period the score
went to 3-1 when Johnson, oil a
beautiful pass from Carl Knecht,
who played inside left in the best
fashion, kicked the goal from close
quarters. It was Johnson who closed
the morning's scoring with a well
played shot from a difficult angle
in the middle of the third quarter.
Bears (Jet Breaks
California had all the breaks, but
of course, most of them were de
served. The Bears had eight free
kicks to Stanford's one and four
corner kicks to the Cards' two.
These kicks seldom result in
scores, however, and figures show
that in direct boots at the goal
Indians had a decided edge. John
son led in scoring attempts, driving
seven shots goalward, while the
team's total was 19. California had
only eight chances.
Buster Holmes, who acted in Ma
loney's place as coach of the team,
should be commended for the fine
manner in which he handled the
players. Twenty-three men com
peted for Stanford.
It took the last game of the sea
son to bring out all that was good
Ihe Stanford soccer team, and
in at "good" was just enough to de
feat'a California varsity 4-1 on its
own home grounds last Saturday
morning, the same California var
sity that had held Stanford to a
scoreless tie last Wednesday.
Stanford needed the victory; it
decided the outcome of this year's
series with the Bears. With the first
game won and the second game
tied, however, the Cards may feel
that they made somewhat of a clean
sweep. The absence of Coach Harry
Maloney at Saturday's game was the
only thing that robbed the situation
of the complete feeling of satisfac
tion that should have accompanied
such a convincing victory.

There wasn't much doubt about
the fact that the team looked good,
but just what it was that caused
this sudden show of iorm cannot be
determined. It certainly wasn't be
cause of favorable playing condi
tions. Hildegarde Field, the scene
of the tilt, is no bargain, unless it
be for Alpine climbers who enjoy
running uphill half the time, and
sliding down the slope for the rest
of the morning.
At any rate, the forwards, long
the missing link in the team's solid
ity, showed some teamwork. They
passed the ball accurately and there
was none of the "ball-hogging" that
has been so prevalent in other
games. If Art Hearn couldn't get
through the opposing halfbacks him
self, he passed the ball to Gas
Rojas or Cy Johnson, and if they
couldn't get anywhere with it, they
sent it to Wataro Sutow, the left
wing. They played as a unit, and
the results make plain the value of
this type of play.
