THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE a scoreless football game. Such
games as the Yale-Dartmouth affair last year (33-33 tie) have a certain
attraction, but in the scoreless battles any touchdown threat assumes im- f
mense proportions—witness Stanford's first-quarter drive to the one-yard i
line and California's do-or-die attempt while the timer's watch ticked
off the last precious seconds of the game.

STANFORD'S PASS DEFENSE worked to perfection. For
the first time this season Stanford backs didn't find themselves far
out of position when opposing passers began to cut loose with
their best throws. The result: California attempted eight passes,
completed none—the only serious Bear attack was engineered by
the fleet running of Hank Schaldach. Though "Hard Luck Henry"
played a brilliant game it must be remembered that his biggest
yardage was made a few minutes after he had replaced Williams
in the fourth quarter, when the strength of Stanford's .gallant
linemen was just about spent. Bill Corbus and Bill Sim were the
only men to play the whole game—those white Nos. "19" and "58"
against a cardinal background were conspicuous in every play.
WE NOTICED IN PARTICULAR: Bill Sim's hard-luck punting. On J
three occasions Stanford's towhead left halfback kicked high, twisting I
spirals that apparently were going to fall dead just inside California's j
five-yard stript", but each time the ball rolled a few inches too far.
But it was Stan Anderson's life-saver mid-way through the fourth j
period that deserves the M.P. degree (Master of Punting). Standing nine
yards behind his own goal line, with everything depending on a long kick
out of danger, Anderson must have had a hard time forgetting his two
blocked punts in the U.C.L.A. game that were converted into touchdowns, i
But Anderson's kick rose from his educated foot with a powerful thud— ,
traveled 73 yards in the air, landing with such impact that Arleigh
Williams, the California safety man, fumbled the ball and allowed it to
roll an additional ten yards toward Stanford's goal.

THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE a scoreless football game. Such
games as the Yale-Dartmouth affair last year (33-33 tie) have a certain
attraction, but in the scoreless battles any touchdown threat assumes im- f
mense proportions—witness Stanford's first-quarter drive to the one-yard i
line and California's do-or-die attempt while the timer's watch ticked
off the last precious seconds of the game.

STANFORD'S PASS DEFENSE worked to perfection. For
the first time this season Stanford backs didn't find themselves far
out of position when opposing passers began to cut loose with
their best throws. The result: California attempted eight passes,
completed none—the only serious Bear attack was engineered by
the fleet running of Hank Schaldach. Though "Hard Luck Henry"
played a brilliant game it must be remembered that his biggest
yardage was made a few minutes after he had replaced Williams
in the fourth quarter, when the strength of Stanford's .gallant
linemen was just about spent. Bill Corbus and Bill Sim were the
only men to play the whole game—those white Nos. "19" and "58"
against a cardinal background were conspicuous in every play.
WE NOTICED IN PARTICULAR: Bill Sim's hard-luck punting. On J
three occasions Stanford's towhead left halfback kicked high, twisting I
spirals that apparently were going to fall dead just inside California's j
five-yard stript", but each time the ball rolled a few inches too far.
But it was Stan Anderson's life-saver mid-way through the fourth j
period that deserves the M.P. degree (Master of Punting). Standing nine
yards behind his own goal line, with everything depending on a long kick
out of danger, Anderson must have had a hard time forgetting his two
blocked punts in the U.C.L.A. game that were converted into touchdowns, i
But Anderson's kick rose from his educated foot with a powerful thud— ,
traveled 73 yards in the air, landing with such impact that Arleigh
Williams, the California safety man, fumbled the ball and allowed it to
roll an additional ten yards toward Stanford's goal.
