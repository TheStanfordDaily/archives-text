# CARD FOUR AWED IN EARLY PERIODS, LOSE POLO MATCH
## San Mateo Polo Club Wins 10-8 As Melone Stars For Stanford 
### Bv Bill Myers 
Apparently awed by their classy
opponents in the first two chukkers,
the Card poloists let the San Mateo
Polo Club hang up four scores in
the opening periods and were finally
beaten 10-8 in a match here Friday.
When their stagefright wore off,
the Redshirts started clicking and
held Willie Tevis Jr.'s outfit to an
average of one goal a period for the
remaining six chukkers. Meanwhile
the Cards brought their side of the
scoring column up to eight goals
and several times threatened to nose
out the San Mateo team.
Card Teamwork Better
Stanford's teamwork was consid
erably improved over its rather
ragged showing in the Menlo match
the week previous. Melone had be
come used to his new number two
position and turned in the most con
sistent game for Stanford. Gillham
wasn't quite up to his usual form.
His shooting was more or less er
ratic, but his hard riding made him
invaluable.
Johnny Myers at back and Lup
peh at number one played their
usual fast games. Myers made some
ti'emendous drives on his bring-ins,
averaging 70 or 80 yards to a shot.
Fuller Underrated
Led by the veteran Tevis, San
Mateo played a fast and brilliant
game. Their stick-work was par
ticularly flashy. Tevis, a five-goal
man, played at back and was large
ly the cause of the Redshirts not
hanging up more tallies. Tevis let
Frank Fuller up at number two
handle the offense while he can
tered along behind the play, ready
to turn the Cards back whenever
they got the ball. Fuller, whose
real ability is greatly underrated by
his one-goal handicap, played some
smashing polo.
Captain Dick Gordan, Stanford
coach, announces that negotiations
with other fast peninsula teams are
under way. He expects to have at
least two more matches scheduled
for this quarter.
