stances. Any bout in which a fighter j
is in distress may be stopped by j
the referee.
Winners will be decided by the j
referee and two judges and deci- :
sions will take into consideration '
ring generalship, aggressiveness, and j
blocking ability, as well as blows :
delivered. Regulation ten-ounce j
padded gloves are a further guar- j
antee that injuries to the inexperi- j
enced boxers will be few and far j
between.
All records for popularity have |
been broken by this year's sign-up, !
which includes a total of more than |
forty novice boxers. Middleweight j
and welterweight divisions top all j
other classes with sixteen and fif- |
teen entrants, respectively. Feather- :
