### BILL MYERS 
Stanford and California students ]
faced a maddening dilemma after i
the Big Game. For there was no ;
victory to celebrate and no sorrows j
to drown.
A few Sons of the Red tried to I
wax merry over the fact that Stan- 1
ford made more first downs and
came five yards closer to scoring
than did California.
To this the Berkeley gang coun
tered: "Aw, all we needed was an- j
other half-minute. We had you on
the run. H'ray!"
But for a general excuse for cele
brating, there just wasn't any. There J
was nothing to guide the merry- |
makers except memories of former i
Big Game nights.
As things turned out, though, the
tie game didn't prevent the celebra
tion from being any different than 1
that of other years. Incomplete
statistics show that Saturday night's i
party was well up to standard:
Waiters brusquely informed 1423 I
couples that "we're sorry, but gin- |
ger-ale is $1 a bottle tonight. You :
might see the manager."
The time-worn Sesame: "It's all !
right. I've got a student body card," i

was repeated 2196 times.
Other bits of jargon and number
of times repeated:
"But I checked a hat here, too."
798.
"Listen, it's after 12 o'clock. Can't
we go in and dance now?" 1643.
"Funny Bill Blutz isn't here. Do
you mind if I come in and wait?"
1867.
"Whew! Fusel oil!" 5487.
"What do you mean? It came
right off the boat?" 5487.
"I'll never take a date again."
3000.
"No more stagglng for me." 3000.
''Got a way for me to get back to
Paly?" 654.
Yesterday afternoon haggard stu
dents wobbled to Joe the Greek's.
Menus: tomato juice, bromos, side
dishes of aspirin. Chatter: "How's
your head?" "Gotta reach clear out
here to touch my forehead." "How'd
the date turn out?" "Aw, shut up."
"Took me an hour and a half to
find my way out of Oakland." "Did
I get stabbed for a parking place!"
"What a night, what a night!"
"Uuhhhhhhhhhh!"
Well, anyway, it only comes once
a year.

party was well up to standard:
Waiters brusquely informed 1423 I
couples that "we're sorry, but gin- |
ger-ale is $1 a bottle tonight. You :
might see the manager."
The time-worn Sesame: "It's all !
right. I've got a student body card," i

was repeated 2196 times.
Other bits of jargon and number
of times repeated:
"But I checked a hat here, too."
798.
"Listen, it's after 12 o'clock. Can't
we go in and dance now?" 1643.
"Funny Bill Blutz isn't here. Do
you mind if I come in and wait?"
1867.
"Whew! Fusel oil!" 5487.
"What do you mean? It came
right off the boat?" 5487.
"I'll never take a date again."
3000.
"No more stagglng for me." 3000.
''Got a way for me to get back to
Paly?" 654.
Yesterday afternoon haggard stu
dents wobbled to Joe the Greek's.
Menus: tomato juice, bromos, side
dishes of aspirin. Chatter: "How's
your head?" "Gotta reach clear out
here to touch my forehead." "How'd
the date turn out?" "Aw, shut up."
"Took me an hour and a half to
find my way out of Oakland." "Did
I get stabbed for a parking place!"
"What a night, what a night!"
"Uuhhhhhhhhhh!"
Well, anyway, it only comes once
a year.
Stanford and California students ]
faced a maddening dilemma after i
the Big Game. For there was no ;
victory to celebrate and no sorrows j
to drown.
A few Sons of the Red tried to I
wax merry over the fact that Stan- 1
ford made more first downs and
came five yards closer to scoring
than did California.
To this the Berkeley gang coun
tered: "Aw, all we needed was an- j
other half-minute. We had you on
the run. H'ray!"
But for a general excuse for cele
brating, there just wasn't any. There J
was nothing to guide the merry- |
makers except memories of former i
Big Game nights.
As things turned out, though, the
tie game didn't prevent the celebra
tion from being any different than 1
that of other years. Incomplete
statistics show that Saturday night's i
party was well up to standard:

ger-ale is $1 a bottle tonight. You :
