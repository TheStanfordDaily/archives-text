### 
EUGENE, Nov. 20 (PlP)â€”That
university men display more inter
est in good books than do univer
sity women was the conclusion
reached by the manager of the book
department of the University of
Oregon Co-op store. Three men
visit the book balcony to every girl
that attends. Non-fiction is preferred
this year.
