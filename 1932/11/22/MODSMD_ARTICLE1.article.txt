# PITT FAVORED TO BEAT CARDS NEXT SATURDAY
## Thirty-Four Stanford Men En Route To Pittsburgh For Big Contest HILLMAN FEARED OUT Indians Have First Workout At Carlin, Nevada 
### Dick Rodda 
Determined to repeat their start
ling victory over the East of last
year against Dartmouth, thirty-four
Stanford Indians are enroute to Pit
tsburg today to take on the unde
feated Pittsburgh Panthers, conquer
ors of Notre Dame.
To the advantage of the Cards,
I hey are once again the underdog
because of the impressive record
made by the Panthers this year.
With previous Stanford Eastern in
vasions in mind, it would surprise
no one to see the Cards come
through against the powerful Pan
thers. And especially after seeing
the battle waged by the Indians
last Saturday one would even be
surprised to see the Cards beaten
if they repeat such a performance.
I'ilt Uses Warner System
There is a different aspect to this
year's post-season task, however,
which is the fact that Pittsburgh
also uses the Warner system. Stan
lord has always bewildered its for
eign opponents with deception but
the Panthers will know just what
to expect, using a varied attack of
their own.
The Panthers defeated Carnegie
Tec h Saturday by a score of 6 to 0.
It was scheduled as a breather but
because of rain and mud and be
cause they were saving themselves
for Stanford, the Pitt eleven took
it easy being satisfied with just a
win.
Humble Notre Dame
Pittsburgh rose to great heights
in the middle of the season by hum
bling Notre Dame by a score of 12
to 0. The Panthers scored twice in
the last quarter and it was one of
the nation's biggest of the many
upsets this year. Although twice
tied, the Panthers will be serious
bidders for the Rose Bowl game
should they defeat Stanford this Sat
urday.

Stopping at Carlin, Nevada, the
big .red machine took its first work
out late yesterday. The boys went
Ihrough a light drill and with the
exception of Jack Hillman they were
itll in good physical shape although
.still a little tired from last Satur
day's battle. II is feared that Hill
man's knee injury will keep him
out of the Pittsburgh game; so Jay
Stevens was added to the squad at
llie last minute. Stevens will alter
nate with Baker at the fullback post
if Hillman is unable to play.

Tec h Saturday by a score of 6 to 0.
It was scheduled as a breather but
because of rain and mud and be
cause they were saving themselves
for Stanford, the Pitt eleven took
it easy being satisfied with just a
win.
Humble Notre Dame
Pittsburgh rose to great heights
in the middle of the season by hum
bling Notre Dame by a score of 12
to 0. The Panthers scored twice in
the last quarter and it was one of
the nation's biggest of the many
upsets this year. Although twice
tied, the Panthers will be serious
bidders for the Rose Bowl game
should they defeat Stanford this Sat
urday.

Stopping at Carlin, Nevada, the
big .red machine took its first work
out late yesterday. The boys went
Ihrough a light drill and with the
exception of Jack Hillman they were
itll in good physical shape although
.still a little tired from last Satur
day's battle. II is feared that Hill
man's knee injury will keep him
out of the Pittsburgh game; so Jay
Stevens was added to the squad at
llie last minute. Stevens will alter
nate with Baker at the fullback post
if Hillman is unable to play.
Determined to repeat their start
ling victory over the East of last
year against Dartmouth, thirty-four
Stanford Indians are enroute to Pit
tsburg today to take on the unde
feated Pittsburgh Panthers, conquer
ors of Notre Dame.
To the advantage of the Cards,
I hey are once again the underdog
because of the impressive record
made by the Panthers this year.
With previous Stanford Eastern in
vasions in mind, it would surprise
no one to see the Cards come
through against the powerful Pan
thers. And especially after seeing
the battle waged by the Indians
last Saturday one would even be
surprised to see the Cards beaten
if they repeat such a performance.
I'ilt Uses Warner System
There is a different aspect to this
year's post-season task, however,
which is the fact that Pittsburgh
also uses the Warner system. Stan
lord has always bewildered its for
eign opponents with deception but
the Panthers will know just what
to expect, using a varied attack of
their own.
