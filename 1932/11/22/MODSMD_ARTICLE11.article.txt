# ROWELL SPEECH ENDS FIRST DAY OF CLUB CONFAB
## Speaker Says Europe Able To Pay Debts; Meet Closes Today 
### 
The first day's session of the two
day Inteinational Relations Clubs'
conference on this campus ended
last night when Chester Rowell
spoke on "The Latest Developments
in the War Debt Situation" before
an audience of 500 in the Assembly
Hall. Fifty-eight representatives
from the ten Northern California
and Nevada colleges are registered
and are attending the luncheons,
dinners, lectures, and round tables
of the conference.
Three questions are paramount in
regard to the payment of the repara
tions by the European nations, said
Rowell. "Can they pay? Will they
pay? And what happens to them
and to us if they do?" These he
answered in the following vein:
"Can Pay"
"Most of them are in a position
to pay the December 1, 1932 in
stallment in American gold double
eagles. France has already made
arrangements in New York. The
British will probably pay,., although
it will lower the pound sterling and
indirectly lose business for Ameri
can concerns. The other nations are
hiding behind France and England
and will follow with them. The
European nations can pay and will
probably pay this year's payment.
"However, if Congress chooses to
call the question closed and to
maintain an uncompromising atti
tude as regards negotiation of war
debts, future payments will be
doubtful. There will be non-pay
ment but not repudiation because
each nation fears the consequential
loss of credit. Negotiation will be
the eventual result.
"Paradox to Come"
"Then will come a paradox. They
will be willing to grant some con
cessions in negotiating and these
will take the probable form of dis
armament resulting in reduced ex
penses for European countries. They
will therefore be able to pay their
debts. Their improved condition
economically will result in the
United States decreasing their in
sistence for payment and the world
improvement will be great eco
nomically and socially. This is the
plausible trend after years of na
tional and international haggling
and illogical ballyhooing in the
face of the obvious economic prin
ciples."
Amy Hemingway Jones, general
director of the Carnegie Foundation
which sponsors the International
Relations clubs, spoke at the recep
tion yesterday morning and at last
night's dinner. Her subject at the
banquet was the International Re
lations clubs she attended on her
recent trip around the world and
their work.
Today there will be the three
round tables on "The Sino-Japanese
Situation," "International Co-opera
tion Through Conferences," and
"The Versailles Treaty in Retro
spect, Its Revision or Abrogation,"
in rooms 308, 310, and 311 of the
library, respectively, from 10 to 12
o'clock in the morning.
The conference will end with a
summarizing all-conference meeting
at 2 o'clock in the Little Theatre, re
viewing the work of the round
tables.
