# Dual Verdict Marks Moot Court Trial
## Hawkins And Edmonds Win Decision On Law But Drop Oral Fight 
### 
For the first time in two years, a
Moot Court Judge last night gave
separate and conflicting decisions on
the law of the case and the winners
of the Moot Court trial.
Judge Edward Hoffman, San Ma
teo practicing attorney and graduate
of the Stanford School of Law,
awarded last night law school moot
court decision to Jean Blum and
James Boccardo by the slim margin
of a slightly better presentation of
oral argument.
Fred Hawkins and Warmer Ed
monids won the decision of the court
in respect to the ruling on the law
of the case. Briefs presented by both
sides, according to Judge Hoffman,
werp even.
Argue Bona-Fide Purchase
Blum and Boccardo, counsel for ap
pellant, in the case of Avery versus
Hatton involving an acceleration
clause in a promissory note argued
that Avery was a bona-fide pur
chaser of the note in question.
Avery had purchased a promissory
note with an acceleration clause in
it controlled by a third party. The
clause had taken effect the day be
fore the purchase of the note, both
parties being in ignorance of its ef
fect at the time of sale.
Hawkins and Edmonds, attorneys
for respondent, maintained that such
a note v/as non-negotiable since the
completion of the acceleration clause
had automatically matured it be
fore the time of sale. Because the
note was purchased after maturity,
Avery was not a holder in due
course and could therefore not col
lect.
Win Law Decision
On this argument Hawkins and
Edmonds won the law decision.
Judge Hoffman declared that "since
the instrument (the note) did not
tell the whole story on its face, it
should not be judged negotiable."
Blum and Boccardo argued that
Avery was a holder in due course
since neither party was aware of
the effect of the acceleration clause
at the time of sale. Further, com
mon justice should protect a bona
fide purchaser. Blum and Boccardo
presented their arguments with dog
matic force-fulness.
Ilurllnit Decision Today
John Hurlbut, moot court judge
in the case argued last Tuesday by
James Robb and Leon Carley against
Wadieh Shibley and George Vargas,
has not announced his decision yet,
but expects to release it sometime
today.
Decision was delayed by incon
sistencies and possible misrepresen
tations which Hurlbut found in the
briefs presented by the moot lawy-
