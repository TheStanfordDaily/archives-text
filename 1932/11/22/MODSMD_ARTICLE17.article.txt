# BEN EASTMAN'S MARKS OKEHED BY COMMITTEE
## Acceptance Not Final Till Approved By A.A.U. Convention 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 21 (/P) â€” The I
track and field committee of the |
Amateur Athletic Union last night
voted to award the men's national
senior and junior outdoor cham
pionships and the national decath
lon test to Chicago.
Denver had put in a bid for these j
events, but withdrew from the field j
so Chicago might be permitted to
run the games during the World's
Fair.
Approve Eastman's Marks
The pentathlon contest was
awarded to New Jersey and the na- ,
tional indoor championships to New j
York, where they have been an an
nual fixture.
The committee approved Ben i
Eastman's 46.4 seconds performance i
in the quarter-mile only after a long
wrangle over the reliability of the j
clocking. The Stanford star's mark, j
if accepted by the convention, will j
displace Ted Meredith's famous;
47 2-5 record. The committee also ,
approved the record of 1:50.9 East- ,
man turned in for the half-mile.
Other Records Okehed
Two records not actually applied
for won approval. Ralph Hill, of i
Oregon, beaten out a step by Lauri ,
Lehtinen in the Olympic 5000-meter
title, shares with the Finn in the
record of 15:30. Glenn Hardin of j
Louisiana, who placed second in the \
Olympic 400-meter hurdles, got j
credit for tying the record of 0:52. j
The winner, Robert Tisdale of Ire
land, knocked down one hurdle and
thus his winning time of 51.8 sec
onds could not be considered.
