### 
Announcing a group of experi
mental conferences to instruct Stan
ford students in the art of study and
concentration, Professor Charles G.
Wrenn invites all students, especially
freshmen and transfers, to a series
of lecture discussions which he plans
to hold each Tuesday for the re
mainder of this quarter, beginning
today at 11 o'clock in the morning
and 7 o'clock in the evening in room
201, unless these hours prove un
satisfactory to those interested.

Coming at the time when smoke
ups are flooding the campus, the
conferences are expected to prove
popular. The series will deal with
reading habits, including a discus
sion both of methods of increasing
reading speed and methods of im
proving reading comprehension;
habits of concentration, involving a
discussion of the specific habits that
are concerned in establishing the
ability to concentrate in study; a
discussion of the training of mem
ories, including an analysis of as
sociation habits involved in the
learning of textbook material; pre
paring for examinations and conduct
during examinations; the discussion
of methods of reviewing and of
other preparation for examinations
as well as of the psychological reac
tion to the examination period itself,
and an analysis of types of exam
ination questions.
