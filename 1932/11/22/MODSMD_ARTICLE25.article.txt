WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 (/H)â€”A
number of prohibition organization
i leaders were banded today in a
(declaration that the recent elections
and (he referenda on liquor ques-
I tions held in a number of states do
| not constitute "a verdict of the
: people on prohibition."
The results of the referenda "were
inevitable," said a statement issued
yesterday over signatures of officers
of the Anti-Saloon League, Meth
odist Board of Temperance, and
Women's Christian Temperance
Union, because all national candi
dates of the two major parties were
j "speaking in advocacy of a change
in the constitution to legalize the
liquor traffic" and no candidates
j were presenting the argument
against the liquor traffic.
