# NEEDY STUDENT AID OFFERED BY DEANS' OFFICES
## Funds From All-University Carnival To Be Used In Relief Work ANNOUNCE $1000 GOAL Five Hundred Io Sponsor Event December 3 
### Collier Council 
As the Relief Carnival with its
$1000 aspirations moves into the
calendar for December 3, a plea to
needy Stanford students is issued
today by that guardian pair over
the hurts of four thousand, Dean
Mary Yost and Dean George B.
Culver.
Students who are without food,
without sweaters, without money to
buy books, or pronged by the ur
gency of small debts, are urged to
come to the Deans' offices to re
ceive aid.
"Need Greater"
"The need is expected to be
greater this year," the Dean of
Women declares. "Last year a spe
cial administrative committee was
appointed in February. This year
we are extending special aid from
the start."
"The Carnival is a generous ges
ture by Stanford women toward re
lief for all students, and I hope the
whole campus will respond," said
Dean of Men George Culver.
No Melodramatics
"I hope students will not let
themselves drift into a melodramatic
state of moneylessness before com
ing around to my office," he insisted.
"We are ready to help any student,
and somehow enough funds will be
raised to do it. Proceeds from the
student Carnival will be a percep
tible aid."
Meanwhile blueprints of Carnival
Night are being pored over by com
mittees from the Row and Roble.
Large-scale donations of food are
asked from Palo Alto and campus
organizations, to be sold from the
booths lining a riotously-decorated
Pavilion on the merriment night.
100 Apple Pics
Scouts are out looking for spoor
of 100 apple pies. A carload of fresh
pineapple which was promised to a
Carnival committee "three Carnivals
ago has left its mark on succeeding
squads. Because of ? rain-spoiled
crop on the islands, or a misdirected
boat, or other adequate reason, the
pineapples did not reach the cam
pus, but their glamorous possibili
ties have set an ambitious standard.

With less princely but as great a
desii'e, committeewomen are asking
contributions of "white elephants,"
rummage, and handy bric-a-brac to
use as prizes for the multifarious
games on Carnival Night.
