# THOSE YELL KINGS
## 
### 
Willi Hit' lust rooting section of the voar disbanded, and
rooters lulls lucked away in the moth halls, the time is
ripe for a discussion of this matter of yell leading here on
the Farm.
The fact that it has not been all it ought to have not
only (hiring the season just ended, but throughout three
years in a stretch is no indictment ol the men who have
held the yell king job. It is ridiculous to suppose that a
man whose job brings him face-to-face with virtually the
entire student body would handle that job in any other
manner than the best he knew how.
Surely the Farm is not lacking in material Irom which
to choose yell leaders. Then the logical conclusion is that
there is something wrong in the method of selecting them.
That something, a fault so obvious that the Daily re
marked on it last May during the election, is simply that
the student body attempts to elect the better of two candi
dates for yell leader in the sprint/, after everyone has for
gotten how good, or how bad, either man was during foot
ball season.
The result is that those who flock to the polls either
guess which name to put the X after, or put it after the
name of the man they heard was a pretty good fellow.
The time to elect the yell leader for next year is right
now, when knowledge of the respective abilities of the
candidates is still fresh in the minds" of students. Such
would inevitably increase the influence of actual ability
upon voles, and decrease accordingly the influence ol poli
tics, or just |vlain chance. And the equally inevitable re
sult would be better yell leading for Stanford.
Some have suggested that a choice could be made at
the regular February election. Delay until February, how
ever, though not as bad as the present May election choice,
would nevertheless allow memory of the men who last
performed in November to grow cold. And a special elec
tion each year, held solely for the purpose of selecting a
yell king, could not fail to bring the issue more forcibly
before the voters.

What scorns an obvious hitch in this plan is in reality
no hitch at all. There is little doubt that the defeated
candidate's interest in his work as assistant would drop off'
considerably alter he knew his chance to be chief had gone.
Hut mere recollection of the amount of yelling done during
winter and spring quarter quashes that argument. Sup
pose the beaten aspirant did resign his assistantship. Two
leaders are sutlicicnt for basketball and track.

Then, of course, there is the problem of getting the two
best assistants available out of the sophomore group of
six that tries out each winter before basketball crowds.
The rally committee chooses these six after careful tests
of all Irvoutees. Then the students, after getting a brief
glimpse of each in action, and forgetting which name be
long to which man, attempts to select the best two by
ballot. The Daily believes that the final selection of the
two assistants ought to be left in the hands of the rally
committee.
II comes simply to Ibis. The veil leading has been con
siderably below standard for years, and the haphazard
method of selecting the yell king is responsible. The Daily
has suggested remedies so obviously sound they almost
prohibit argument.
Now all that remains is for the executive committee to
act.
