# HEY NOAHS!

Decked on I in their sportiest regalia, the fair coeds of
the dear old Farm start off on a bright sunny morning with
their books under their arms to walk to class. Hardly have
they left Ihe safe confines of their own porches when they
are deluged by the sprinklers of the other houses on the
How.
The coeds object to this "water cure." The sage Daily,
weighing the pros and cons with due deliberation, feels
that these ladies have a just cause for protest. After all,
although no one can be sure, at the present writing there
has never been a case recorded of any luxurious growth
springing from a bed of sidewalk-cement. The conclusion
reached, therefore, is that this water is being wasted!
The gallantry and the frugality of the Stanford man
should be touched by the plight of our coeds. It is prob
ably the first lime in local history that one's gallantry can
have full play without paining one's frugality!
