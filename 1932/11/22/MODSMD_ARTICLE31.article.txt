# BULL SESSION
## THE 						POOR LEAGUE 
### 
Woodrow Wilson was a great man. [
He was an idealist. So great was
his idealism that eight years after
his death his hopes are still coloring
our active national thought. He was
a powerful man. In 1916 he won a
national election because he kept
us out of war. And about a year
later he had the whole nation in
the war to make the world safe for
democracy.
Because the World War was
ballyhooed as the war to end war |
some people still believe it. But
such people believe most ballyhoo.
The World War was so horrible that
people are still terrified by it. Books
on international relations always j
quote overpowering statistics on the
horrific cost of war as fluent evi
dence that war is dead.
And on the assumption that all
the nations would sheath swords |
and unsheath tongues to bring about j
the peaceable settlement of disputes
a League of Nations was founded. \
And that organization has been
printing literature ever since. It has
done things, however. The Aaland i
Island controversy was raking the f
civilized world with controversy— !
threatening to send all mankind to j
death and destruction. That was set
tled. Some Balkan powers thought i
they wanted to war, and disrupt '
France's attempt at an ecomonic 1
empire in Central Europe. They
were inhibited.
The day of peace had dawned.

' The flutter of dove's wings al
, most obscuring the sun of happiness
when . . . Across the waters from
Half Moon Bay, a controversy was
brewed between Japan and China.
! Japan prepared to settle the situa
tion in the way big powers settle
; things; as we have done in Haiti,
Nicaragua, Cuba, and the rest.
China, lacking modern military
strength, wanted to settle the ques
tion the new Wilsonian way. Poor
China somehow thought or pre
! tended to think that problems of
force could be settled by amiable
! diplomats over their seventeenth
century wine. And so commissions
not being exclusively an American
affliction, the League appointed the
Lytton investigators. They did what,
if Congress does it, is called a
j "junket"—took a trip to the Orient
I tc gather the facts.
They reported adversely for Japan
| and Japan has, after suitable delay,
refused to accept the findings. No
! one had a right to expect otherwise.
Imagine England withdrawing from
India because some learned com
missioners thought she should. Don't
imagine it. It is an imaginative im
possibility. People forget that since
Western methods and armaments
have been adopted by Japan, she
! has the "right" to act just like Eng
' land.
Japan must not forget, however,
that she hasn't got all the alliances
! and cruisers that England has—at
I least not yet. —Abe Mellinkoff

Woodrow Wilson was a great man. [
He was an idealist. So great was
his idealism that eight years after
his death his hopes are still coloring
our active national thought. He was
a powerful man. In 1916 he won a
national election because he kept
us out of war. And about a year
later he had the whole nation in
the war to make the world safe for
democracy.
Because the World War was
ballyhooed as the war to end war |
some people still believe it. But
such people believe most ballyhoo.
The World War was so horrible that
people are still terrified by it. Books
on international relations always j
quote overpowering statistics on the
horrific cost of war as fluent evi
dence that war is dead.
And on the assumption that all
the nations would sheath swords |
and unsheath tongues to bring about j
the peaceable settlement of disputes
a League of Nations was founded. \
And that organization has been
printing literature ever since. It has
done things, however. The Aaland i
