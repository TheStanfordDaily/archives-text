AIR MAIL—At Stanford Theatre—
A Wild West thriller with air
planes for horses is the current film
at the Stanford Theatre. With the
hazardous life of the air mail pilots
as a background there is presented
the thin plot of a man who had to
sacrifice love for his duty as a flier
and of his friend who had a wife
waiting for him to be killed so she
could marry the bad boy of the
show. The bad boy is Pat O'Brien.
He does convincing work with his
role of the wild pilot who breaks up
his companion's family and, with
unnecessary stunting, one or two
planes.
Ralph Bellamy furnishes the
heroic lead but he misplaces his
dramatic gestures once or twice too
often to make him entirely accept
able. Gloria Stuart was adequate
but Lillian Bond played the unfaith
ful wife with unbecoming stiffness.
Slim Summerville had simply to
show his face to produce the needed
roars of comic relief.
Whoever did the stunt flying for
"Air Mail" certainly earned his
money. There are numerous crashes
and sufficiently exciting reckless
flying to keep the audience in its
seats when the plot gives out. The
snow and sleet and mountain shots
were excellent. The filming was by
far the best feature of this show.
With the main picture there is a
news reel of the Big Game and a
Charlie Chase comedy. —Stanford

NIGHT OVER TAOS—By Maxwell
Anderson. Samuel French, Inc.,
19.12.

| Maxwell Anderson had, in the
final gesture of the Spanish of New
| Mexico, excellent material for an
j historical drama of beauty and
| power. But, by introducing family
! squabbles into such a setting, he
' drained the romantic potentialities
i of the situation completely.

Too, he changed his viewpoint in
what was probably an attempt to
present both sides of the case of the
trapped caballeros. At first present
i ing them as a hopelessly but gal
lantly fated group, he surprisingly
introduced the case of the down
trodden peons in the last act—a bad
procedure in any but a problem
I play, and in this romantic drama,
j only disconcerting. After building
j sympathy for Taos, as represented
by Pedro Montoya, Anderson then
breaks it down by exposing some
medieval politics.
The play turns into melodrama as
one character attempts to maintain
; a balance until the final deluge of
stubborn self-sacrifice when it
I breaks into sentimentality with the
draught of poison which ends the
Play-
Anderson annoyingly prints in
I broken lines, prose which is not
[ poetry—or even vers libre. The
! habit brings back memories of thin
! red and yellow volumes and short
| lived magazines, self-assertedly or-
I gans of freedo mand the new mode
'of expression.
The third act is far too long and
'repetitious—a fault which applies to
I the play as a whole. In the extra
1 time, Anderson is tempted and falls
1 into sentimentality. —Sandoe
