1 The Editor, Sir:
I We screamed like the devil last
| year when California claimed a
! moral victory over U.S.C. Why don't
we practice what we preach? Bob
i Wade in his article says, "Stanford
I beat Berkeley's two best teams." If
j lhat isn't the same thing as howling
i about a moral victory, I don't know
I what the term means. Come on, let's
! be good sportsâ€”the scoreboard (and
' that's what goes down in the rec
| ords) said 0-0, and that's no vic
j tory!
Yours, John Merrill, '33
