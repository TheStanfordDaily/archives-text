STANFORD'S 1932-33 ATHLETIC SEASON has started out in novel
fashion: Indian and Bear varsity football teams played the first scoreless
tie in Big Game history, a Stanford freshman eleven went through its
season undefeated, intercollegiate cross-country made its Bay Region
debut, and now a group of John Bunn's hard-working players are looking
forward to the first barnstorming out-of-state trip in Stanford basketball
history.

nament (this afternoon in the Encina Gym boxing room) usually
provide more action than the whole Indian intercollegiate season.
Many of the competing fighters (we can hardly say "boxers' )
are stepping inside the squared circle for the first time—they spend
about a minute conquering their natural timidity, and then they
begin to swing—and HOW THEY SWING! Most of the bouts end
in knockouts or technical knockouts as the poorly conditioned
novices find out just how long three rounds of two minutes can be.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT—The open season for All-American teams has
arrived. The Associated Press eleven (one of the most highly-thought-of
selections) will be released December 4, but individual newspapers will
probably start the ball rolling soon after Thursday's crucial Thanksgiving
Day games.
Ail-American teams do not possess the unerring definiteness, which
iso pleasing to Mr. American Pseudo-Scientific Minded—but in .spite of
this drawback (?), we feel that these "mythical elevens" have a certain
place in the football world. They provide immeasurable enjoyment to
the bleacher coaches (their name is legion) who compose unbeatable com
binations while waiting for the Oakland ferry or the 39th Street. Subway.
To be sure, these "experts" see no more than one or two of their '"first
stringers" in action during the season —but what of that? It's a lot of fun!
Playing football is a lot of fun and doesn't get anywhere in
particular—the same applies to picking All-American teams, so
why not go ahead and pick them? We suspect that the opponents
of All-American Experting are just a trifle too pedagogic in their
athletic inclinations. Let's leave the scientific method to Tuesday

Ford Palmer, pass-snatching end, was a second-string fullback in
high school—the speedy Dick Barber never got out of Class B football
during his prep days. Ernie Smith couldn't even make a regular position
on the Trojan frosh team in his first year, but became the coast's best
tackle. Bob Erskine, who can hold down any position on the Trojan
eleven, never donned football cleats until he came to U.S.C. He was
Ottumwa, lowa's best basketball player a few years back. —A.J.G.
STANFORD'S 1932-33 ATHLETIC SEASON has started out in novel
fashion: Indian and Bear varsity football teams played the first scoreless
tie in Big Game history, a Stanford freshman eleven went through its
season undefeated, intercollegiate cross-country made its Bay Region
debut, and now a group of John Bunn's hard-working players are looking
forward to the first barnstorming out-of-state trip in Stanford basketball
history.

Many of the competing fighters (we can hardly say "boxers' )
are stepping inside the squared circle for the first time—they spend
about a minute conquering their natural timidity, and then they
begin to swing—and HOW THEY SWING! Most of the bouts end
in knockouts or technical knockouts as the poorly conditioned
novices find out just how long three rounds of two minutes can be.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT—The open season for All-American teams has
arrived. The Associated Press eleven (one of the most highly-thought-of
selections) will be released December 4, but individual newspapers will
probably start the ball rolling soon after Thursday's crucial Thanksgiving
Day games.
Ail-American teams do not possess the unerring definiteness, which

this drawback (?), we feel that these "mythical elevens" have a certain
place in the football world. They provide immeasurable enjoyment to
the bleacher coaches (their name is legion) who compose unbeatable com

To be sure, these "experts" see no more than one or two of their '"first
stringers" in action during the season —but what of that? It's a lot of fun!
Playing football is a lot of fun and doesn't get anywhere in

why not go ahead and pick them? We suspect that the opponents
of All-American Experting are just a trifle too pedagogic in their
