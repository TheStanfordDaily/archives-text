NEW YORK, Nov. 21 (/P)â€”Ralph
Metcalf, runner-up to Eddie Tolan
in the Olympic 100 meters, and Mrs.
Evelyn Hall of Chicago, second to
Babe Didrikson in the 80-meter
hurdles, today were recognized as
co-holders of the American record
for their respective events by the
Amateur Athletic Union.
Following upon a heated discus
sion on the floor, led by Gustavus
Kirby and A. C. Gilbert of New
Haven, the delegates decided that
Metcalf and Hall had finished in a
virtual tie for first place and should
be credited with a record together
with Tolan and Didrikson.

Six men of Alabama's 1930 foot
i ball team became college coaches.
