# CLARK REVIEWS EUROPEAN TOUR
## Gives Illustrated Lecture Here This Evening 
### 
A pictorial-verbal account of "A
Year of Motoring in Europe" is the
program scheduled for 7:30 o'clock
tonight in the Assembly Hall by
Professor A. B. Clark, Stanford
resident since 1892.
Starting from Cherbourg, France,
in an American car, Dr. Clark cov
ered a distance of over 12,000 miles
from August 1931 to August 1932.
For the most part, gasoline was from
22 to 30 cents a gallon and was
imported from the United States.
The three major interests of the
Clark party were architecture, mu
seum exhibits, and general pictur
esqueness of the countries visited.
Dr. Clark did sketching along the
way.
Major stops were made at Chartes,
Seville, Florence, Rome, Canter
bury, and Oxford. From these cen
ters, numerous minor expeditions
took Dr. Clark into the surrounding
rui'al territory.
Dr. Clark has prepared a group
of 80 slides depicting the life, land
scapes, and culture of Europe and
Morocco. These pictures will form
the basis for the talk this evening,
and will trace the highlights of the
journey.
