# Babe Water Polo Team To Meet San Jose Club
## 
### 
Encountering its first real opposi- j
tion of the season, Stanford's unde
feated freshman water polo team j
will meet the San Jose swimming j
club septet at 4:20 o'clock tjiis after- j
noon in Encina pool. As San Jose j
State College does not sponsor !
water polo as a school sport, the ,
visitors will present a line-up com- j
posed of a group of the college men :
who organized the team upon their !
own initiative. In spite of the fact 1
that the San Jose boys do not have ;
any regular paid coach, they have >
a strong outfit and should give the
Indian yearlings a tough afternoon, j
Old man influenza, which was visit
ing so many of the Stanfordites last
week, has also made himself felt
among the ranks of the frosh squad,
paying his respects to ten of its
members.
Although the club team boasts of
much more individual brilliance
than the frosh, Coach Thornton
feels that his boys will have the ad- 1
j vantage of teamwork and expects
|to give the invaders a strenuous
! workout.

and football while at Syracuse.
