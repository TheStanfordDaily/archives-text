â€”Racketeering and allied evils
threaten to destroy the American
trade movement, says a statement
accompanying a "Bill of Particu
lars" on alleged union abuses sub
mitted today to the executive coun
cil of the American Federation of
Labor.
The communication charged the
federation has recognized "the
widespread extent of the evil" but
that "nothing substantial has as yet
been done to curb these abuses."
