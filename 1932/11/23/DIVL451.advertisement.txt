Thomas W. Gerber of the execu
tive staff of the United Press
says: "Seeking, reporting, inter
preting and distributing news is
today a complex business, an ex
citing profession, a responsible
career. It is a field only for seri
ous-minded, clear-thinking men
and women. The day of romantic,
adventurous assignments is large
ly over."
r HERE'S no more "newspaper
game." Today, it's a business—
till exciting, but calling for all-round
.esourcefulncss. That's why news
paper men agree with college men in
hoosing a pipe as their favorite smokci
\ pipe helps a man organize hio
nind for clear thinking.
Why did college men choose Edge
vorth as their favorite smoking tobac
o?* Because it's individual! A blend
,<f fine old burleys that's different.
But the proof of the pudding is ir
he eating. So drop a line to Laru
