pare for the coming session, Speaker ;
John N. Garner, the Vice-President- j
elect, reiterated his prediction that
this Congress would legalize beer of
"about 2.75 or 3 per cent" alcoholic
content.
He "guessed" that beer revenue ;
would net 8250,000,000 annually. 1
Garner said also that with a beer
bill and reductions in Government '
expenses, it might be possible to
secure a balanced budget without
passing other forms of taxation, i
Constitutional lieer
Asked what percentage beer he
favored, the Democratic Vice-Presi
dent-elect said "within the consti
tution."
"About 2.75 or 3 per cent?" he
was asked.
"Somewhere around that," Garner \
replied.
President-elect Roosevelt was |
represented authoritatively as anx- i
icus for the present Congress to j
cnact beer legislation. A close as- j
sociate said "he wants to put the j
party's platform in effect as soon !
as possible and he wants the Treas
ury to receive revenue from beer.
