# DECISION GIVEN ON MOOT CASE
## Hurlbut Announces Shibley And Vargas Winners 
### 
Wadieh Shibley and George Var
gas defeated James Robb and Leon
Carley in the second moot court
trial held last Tuesday night, ac-
I cording to an announcement yes
terday by John Hurlbut, member of
.the moot court board and judge of
the case.
Hurlbut studied the case in great
er detail than do most moot court
judges, participants in the trial de
clared. In rendering decision for the
respondents, the court, however,
pointed out that the law of the case
I was on the other side, and decided
the point of law in favor of Robb
and Carlcy.
Second Split Decision
Following close upon the heels of
i Monday's decision, this is the sec
i ond time in two years that the win
\ ners of the trial did not also win
; the law point involved.
Both teams were complimented
on the able and careful presentation
of the law in their briefs.
The case involved the question of
whether a misdemeanor resulting in
an unintentional killing is sufficient
| grounds for a manslaughter trijl. A
i gun carried in the pocket of a car
exploded when the car burred,
killing a fireman. The driver did not
i have a license for the gun.
Statute Definition
Statute defines involuntary man
slaughter as any killing in the com
mission of a misdemeanor. The court
felt that the doctrine of involuntary
; manslaughter was harsh.
It may be that certain acts now
prohibited because * Ihey are dan-
I gerous to society while not wrong in
i themselves, at common law should
i be brought within the definition of
manslaughter, the court declared.
In the case at bar, however, these
suggestions cannot be sensibly in
jected into the law since a criminal
intent is not involved.
In announcing his decision, Hurl
but gave Shibley and Vargas a slight
; edge in briefs and presentation.
