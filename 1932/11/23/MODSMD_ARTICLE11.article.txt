# Stanford? Sure! That's Where Ben Comes From

Stanford?
Yah, sure! It's that I 'liii crsiliit in j
California where Ben Eastman
achieved world-wide fame.
John D. Peck, Class of '32, and
now a guest student at the Univer
sity of Munich, has found that more
Munich students identify Stanford
with Ben Eastman than with Presi
dent Hoover. Interested in knowing
how many of his fellow students
had ever heard of the Farm, Peck
tested them for their first reactions.
Vaguely, one beer-guzzling un
dergraduate said that he had heard
of Stanford somewhere, and asked
if it were actually true that the
student body slept out of doors
throughout the year. He couldn't
quite believe that Stanford lay in a
snow-free valley.
Others knew of the University as
the place where Hoover "came
I from." (

I Peck has found Central Europe
pretty well crowded with Stanford
men and women. Entering an Amer
ican Express agency, or passing
through a railroad depot, it is not
uncommon to meet former Stanford
students collecting the mail from
home or rushing on to the next
stopover.
Some are working at German uni
versities for advanced degrees;
others are abroad awaiting the re
turn of prosperity to the United
States with its accompanying
abundance of jobs.
And Germany and Austria are
good places for the student with a
small amount of money, according
to Peck. Seventy-five dollars a
month is ample income to insure
good board and room, payment of
tuition, a healthy supply of beer,
opera, and the theatre, and postage
for the letters which urge the dis-
I patch of more money from home.
