# FAMOUS NEGRO CHOIR TO SING HERE TUESDAY
## Chorus Of 'Green Pastures' Fame To Give Second A.S.S.U. Concert 
### Ellamae Dodds 
Singing devotional songs, episodic
songs, and songs of religious ex
perience, which portray the music
of the negro in his many moods,
the Hall Johnson Negro Chorus of
"Green Pastures" fame will come to
the Stanford Assembly Hall at 8:20
o'clock next Tuesday evening as the
second attraction of the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series for 1932-33.
The chorus is composed of six
teen mixed voices, directed by Mr.
Johnson, who has especially written
all the choral arrangements used
by his choir. Not all the songs in
the repertory are spirituals. There
are numbers like "The St. James
Infirmary Blues," "The St. Louis
Blues," "Water Boy," and "Dis 01'
Hammer." The program is selected
to appeal to highbrow and lowbrow
alike.
Acclaimed in New York
The Hall Johnson Negro Chorus
was brought to the attention of
musical audiences of New York by
a sudden triumph after months of
struggle. After a year of rehearsing
and singing in the heart of New
York City's negro colony in Har
lem, they received an engagement
to appear at a reception for the
famous French composer, Maurice
Ravel. The success of this first pub
lic appearance was so great that
they were engaged for a concert
with the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra at the summer Stadium
concerts.
There, after their first song, the
rain suddenly descended in torrents.
But the audience, instead of rush
ing as usual for the exits, dashed
to the front of the stadium to seek
protection under the platform's pro
jecting shell. Those who failed to
get under the projection accepted
the drenching, unwilling to miss
hearing the other numbers of the
chorus. The choir sang number
after number, until the management
called a halt, promptly giving them
a return engagement, for the next
evening.
Second Concert Success
Their second concert brought out
the largest audience ever assem
bled at the stadium and for the first
time in the history of the summer
concerts the Standing Room Only
sign had to be displayed.
In the spring of 1930 "The Green
Pastures," Marc Connelly's Pulitzer
prize-winning play, with music by
the Hall Johnson Chorus, was pro
duced in New York, becoming at
once one of the biggest successes in
recent years, in a large degree be
cause of the singing of the chorus
which is heard throughout the en
tire play.
There is still a saving for students,
faculty, and employees of the Uni
versity who wish to obtain season
tickets for the remainder of the con
cert series which includes, besides
the Hall Johnson Chorus, an ap
pearance of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra conducted by Mo
linari, and a concert by Yehudi
Mcnuhin, San Francisco's boy vio
linist.

The chorus is composed of six
teen mixed voices, directed by Mr.
Johnson, who has especially written
all the choral arrangements used
by his choir. Not all the songs in
the repertory are spirituals. There
are numbers like "The St. James
Infirmary Blues," "The St. Louis
Blues," "Water Boy," and "Dis 01'
Hammer." The program is selected
to appeal to highbrow and lowbrow
alike.
Acclaimed in New York
The Hall Johnson Negro Chorus
was brought to the attention of
musical audiences of New York by
a sudden triumph after months of
struggle. After a year of rehearsing
and singing in the heart of New
York City's negro colony in Har
lem, they received an engagement
to appear at a reception for the
famous French composer, Maurice
Ravel. The success of this first pub
lic appearance was so great that
they were engaged for a concert
with the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra at the summer Stadium
concerts.
There, after their first song, the
rain suddenly descended in torrents.
But the audience, instead of rush
ing as usual for the exits, dashed
to the front of the stadium to seek
protection under the platform's pro
jecting shell. Those who failed to
get under the projection accepted
the drenching, unwilling to miss
hearing the other numbers of the
chorus. The choir sang number
after number, until the management
called a halt, promptly giving them
a return engagement, for the next
evening.
Second Concert Success
Their second concert brought out
the largest audience ever assem
bled at the stadium and for the first
time in the history of the summer
concerts the Standing Room Only
sign had to be displayed.
In the spring of 1930 "The Green
Pastures," Marc Connelly's Pulitzer
prize-winning play, with music by
the Hall Johnson Chorus, was pro
duced in New York, becoming at
once one of the biggest successes in
recent years, in a large degree be
cause of the singing of the chorus
which is heard throughout the en
tire play.
There is still a saving for students,
faculty, and employees of the Uni
versity who wish to obtain season
tickets for the remainder of the con
cert series which includes, besides
the Hall Johnson Chorus, an ap
pearance of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra conducted by Mo
linari, and a concert by Yehudi
Mcnuhin, San Francisco's boy vio
linist.
Singing devotional songs, episodic
songs, and songs of religious ex
perience, which portray the music
of the negro in his many moods,
the Hall Johnson Negro Chorus of
"Green Pastures" fame will come to
the Stanford Assembly Hall at 8:20
o'clock next Tuesday evening as the
second attraction of the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series for 1932-33.
