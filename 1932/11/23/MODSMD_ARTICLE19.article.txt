# CARNIVAL TO BE DECEMBER LURE
## 
### 
One of the gayer prospects that
brings Stanford students homing
back to the campus is the Relief
Carnival scheduled for December 3.
which falls Friday night one week
after the return from Thanksgiving
vacation.
A closed date granted by the Ex-
Committee for that night assures the
campus of but a single lureâ€”the
hilarious Pavilion, which an enter
prising "500" will have carpentered,
hammered and painted into a fan
tastic guise, and which, with colos
sal quantities of food and the atten
tions of Gordon Heche's orchestra,
threatens the most rollicking Car
nival in years.
One thousand dollars is the mark
set by the Student Relief Committee
which is energetically at work, in
the role of Carnival squad-leaders.
