SEATTLE, Nov. 22 (PlP)—Com
paring sanitary conditions of the I
women's gymnasium and the Uni
versity of Washington athletic pa- \
vilion, the Washington Daily found :
that the pavilion was most unsani- j
tary. Fifty per cent of the men stu- ;
dents enrolled for intramural swim- ,
ming this fall were barred from i
competition because they had con- I
tracted "athlete's foot."
''Unfumigatcd lockers, players on j
the floors wearing street shoes, no :
footbaths anywhere, infected bodies
tossing on the exercising mats — \
that's the picture at the men's ath- j
U-tic pavilion," says the Daily. The
women's gymnasium, on the other ;
hand, is spick and span everyplace; \
footbaths and sandals protect
against "athlete's foot"; and lockers ;
are kept clean.
