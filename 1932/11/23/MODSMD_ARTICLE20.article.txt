WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 </P)—An
historic conference between Herbert
Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt
ended tonight with two points stand
ing forth as the probable answer

The conference under the twink
ling chandeliers of the famous Red
room brought a forty-word state
ment from the White House:
"The President and Governor
Roosevelt traversed at length the
subjects mentioned in their tele
graphic communication.
"It is felt that progress was made.
"The President confers with the
members of Congress tomorrow
when the subject will be further
pursued."
Other Parleys Set
In inviting Mr. Roosevelt to the
White House, President Hoover list
ed not only the debts, but also dis
armament and the coming world
economic conference as subjects for
their consideration.
Before Mr. Hoover meets with
congressional leaders, the President
elect will have an opportunity to
talk with the chieftains of his party
in the national Legislature. Meetings
were arranged for late tonight and
tomorrow. He attended a dinner in
his honor at the National Press Club
this evening.
Conference Guarded
In their discussion of the ramifi
cations of the debt question, the
President and the man who has
been chosen to succeed him sur
veyed also the problem of the make
up of the American delegation to the
economic conference.
From the time the President
elect was announced as "the Gov
ernor of New York" until his part
ing handshake with President Hoo
ver at the elevator outside the Red
room,' more than two hours later,
there was no word of the progress
of the meeting.
Roosevelt Silent
At a press conference immediately
after the White House meeting, Mr,
Roosevelt declined to make any
statement as to the talk. He gave
the distinct impression that the
statement from the White House
covered the situation entirely.
He emphasized that discussions
arranged tonight with Congressional
leaders were to be purely informal,
and reiterated that he would not try
to dictate to the present Congress.
