# WEARY INDIANS REACH BATTLE SCENE TONIGHT
## Unbeaten Pittsburgh Team Given 3-1 Odds Over Stanford Squad HILLMAN, BAKER HURT Gruelling Big Game Wears Cardinal Eleven 
### Albert Guerard 
Battered and tired from one of
the greatest battles ever waged by a
Stanford football team, "Pop" War
ner and his thrice-defeated Indian
squad arrive in Pittsburgh tonight,
banking on determination and tradi
tion rather than superior football to
pull them through their final test of
the 1932 campaign.
While Stanford's powerful full
backs, Jack Hillman and Phil Ba
ker, nursed injuries which will
probably keep them from playing
for more than a few minutes in Sat
urday's game against the Panthers,
University of Pittsburgh's two in
jured stars, Captain Paul Reider and
Mike Sebastian, skyrocketed their
team's already bright chances of
victory by sharing the right half
back post in an hour and a half
practice drill yesterday afternoon.
Pitt Favored
Justifiable odds of 3-1 favoritism
were quoted on the Panthers yes
terday, for while the Indian team
was dropping games to U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Washington, tying
California, and winning over Olym
pic Club, San Francisco, Oregon
State, West Coast Army, and the
California Aggies, Pittsburgh ham
mered out remarkable victories over
Notre Dame, Army, Pennsylvania,
Ohio Northern, West Virginia, Du
quesne, and Carnegie Tech. The
1932 Panthers are undefeated, but
were held to scoreless ties by Ohio
State and Nebraska.
While the Panthers were coasting
to a 6-0 victory over Carnegie Tech
last Saturday, Stanford engaged in
one of the most ferocious Big Games
that Indian-Bear gridiron competi
tion has produced. Pittsburgh's first
string players had little work to do;
but Stanford's regulars battled so
hard that many of them were forced
to leave the game from exhaustion.
Following closely on the three
stinging conference defeats suffered
at the hands of U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Washington, the scoreless Big Game
(with its breath-taking, savagely
fought ending) provided an emo
tional climax to the Indian season.
Not only physical superiority, but
psychological advantage is on Pitts
burgh's side, for even the masterful
"Pop" Warner will find it well-nigh
impossible to bring his men buck to
the same mental attitude which en
abled them to play so well last Sat
urday.
Wes Stevens to Play .
A great deal will depend on a lil
tle-used Indian fullback, Wes Ste
vens—particularly if the injuries of
Jack Hillman and Phil Baker fail to
mend by Saturday afternoon. Ste
vens has shown up well in practice
sessions—he is a hard fighter, but
will find Pittsburgh's line a fat
tougher proposition than the West
Coast Army.and Cal Aggie forward
wails which he pierced with good
success.
One outstanding factor points to
possible Stanford touchdowns Sat
urday afternoon: Pittsburgh's tack
les are weak. "Pop" Warner's pow
erful reverses will pound at Cuba
and Walton, the poorest men in the
Pittsburgh line.
Panther Stars
Pittsburgh's outstanding lineman
is Skaldany, who is being touted as
a possible All-American end. Quar
terback Hogan is the blocking back.
He is heavy and powerful. Warren
Heller, the best running back in the
East, and Mike Sebastian will be the
starting halfbacks. Fullback Wein
stock completes the Panther back
field.
Weather conditions may play an
important part in deciding the issue.
A muddy field would kill the In
dian's opportunity to employ the
"Razzle-Dazzle" offense that has
mystified Stanford's intersectional
opponents in past years. The Pan
thers are not likely to be fooled
badly even on a dry field, however,
for they use the Warner system ex
clusively, and are well versed in de
fending against it.
Stanford's chances of winning
hinge on so many doubtful factors
that unqualified prediction of an In
dian victory would be unjustified.
But it is certain that a team which
can hold fast against such tre
mendous odds as were presented in
the Big Game last Saturday will not
resign itself to defeat before the
game begins.

California, and winning over Olym
pic Club, San Francisco, Oregon
State, West Coast Army, and the
California Aggies, Pittsburgh ham
mered out remarkable victories over
Notre Dame, Army, Pennsylvania,
Ohio Northern, West Virginia, Du
quesne, and Carnegie Tech. The
1932 Panthers are undefeated, but
were held to scoreless ties by Ohio
State and Nebraska.
While the Panthers were coasting
to a 6-0 victory over Carnegie Tech
last Saturday, Stanford engaged in
one of the most ferocious Big Games
that Indian-Bear gridiron competi
tion has produced. Pittsburgh's first
string players had little work to do;
but Stanford's regulars battled so
hard that many of them were forced
to leave the game from exhaustion.
Following closely on the three
stinging conference defeats suffered
at the hands of U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Washington, the scoreless Big Game
(with its breath-taking, savagely
fought ending) provided an emo
tional climax to the Indian season.
Not only physical superiority, but
psychological advantage is on Pitts
burgh's side, for even the masterful
"Pop" Warner will find it well-nigh
impossible to bring his men buck to
the same mental attitude which en
abled them to play so well last Sat
urday.
Wes Stevens to Play .
A great deal will depend on a lil
tle-used Indian fullback, Wes Ste
vens—particularly if the injuries of
Jack Hillman and Phil Baker fail to
mend by Saturday afternoon. Ste
vens has shown up well in practice
sessions—he is a hard fighter, but
will find Pittsburgh's line a fat
tougher proposition than the West
Coast Army.and Cal Aggie forward
wails which he pierced with good
success.
One outstanding factor points to
possible Stanford touchdowns Sat
urday afternoon: Pittsburgh's tack
les are weak. "Pop" Warner's pow
erful reverses will pound at Cuba
and Walton, the poorest men in the
Pittsburgh line.
Panther Stars
Pittsburgh's outstanding lineman
is Skaldany, who is being touted as
a possible All-American end. Quar
terback Hogan is the blocking back.
He is heavy and powerful. Warren
Heller, the best running back in the
East, and Mike Sebastian will be the
starting halfbacks. Fullback Wein
stock completes the Panther back
field.
Weather conditions may play an
important part in deciding the issue.
A muddy field would kill the In
dian's opportunity to employ the
"Razzle-Dazzle" offense that has
mystified Stanford's intersectional
opponents in past years. The Pan
thers are not likely to be fooled
badly even on a dry field, however,
for they use the Warner system ex
clusively, and are well versed in de
fending against it.
Stanford's chances of winning
hinge on so many doubtful factors
that unqualified prediction of an In
dian victory would be unjustified.
But it is certain that a team which
can hold fast against such tre
mendous odds as were presented in
the Big Game last Saturday will not
resign itself to defeat before the
game begins.

burgh's side, for even the masterful
"Pop" Warner will find it well-nigh
impossible to bring his men buck to
the same mental attitude which en
abled them to play so well last Sat
urday.
Wes Stevens to Play .
A great deal will depend on a lil
tle-used Indian fullback, Wes Ste
vens—particularly if the injuries of
Jack Hillman and Phil Baker fail to
mend by Saturday afternoon. Ste
vens has shown up well in practice
sessions—he is a hard fighter, but
will find Pittsburgh's line a fat
tougher proposition than the West
Coast Army.and Cal Aggie forward
wails which he pierced with good
success.
One outstanding factor points to
possible Stanford touchdowns Sat
urday afternoon: Pittsburgh's tack
les are weak. "Pop" Warner's pow
erful reverses will pound at Cuba
and Walton, the poorest men in the
Pittsburgh line.
Panther Stars
Pittsburgh's outstanding lineman
is Skaldany, who is being touted as
a possible All-American end. Quar
terback Hogan is the blocking back.
He is heavy and powerful. Warren
Heller, the best running back in the
East, and Mike Sebastian will be the
starting halfbacks. Fullback Wein
stock completes the Panther back
field.
Weather conditions may play an
important part in deciding the issue.
A muddy field would kill the In
dian's opportunity to employ the
"Razzle-Dazzle" offense that has
mystified Stanford's intersectional
opponents in past years. The Pan
thers are not likely to be fooled
badly even on a dry field, however,
for they use the Warner system ex
clusively, and are well versed in de
fending against it.
Stanford's chances of winning
hinge on so many doubtful factors
that unqualified prediction of an In
dian victory would be unjustified.
But it is certain that a team which
can hold fast against such tre
mendous odds as were presented in
the Big Game last Saturday will not
resign itself to defeat before the
game begins.

CAPETOWN, Union of South
Africa, Nov. 22 (/P) —Amy Johnson,

flight from England to Capetown,
said today that she will fly home
next month in an attempt to set a
record for the round trip.
Battered and tired from one of
the greatest battles ever waged by a
Stanford football team, "Pop" War
ner and his thrice-defeated Indian
squad arrive in Pittsburgh tonight,
banking on determination and tradi
tion rather than superior football to
pull them through their final test of
the 1932 campaign.
While Stanford's powerful full
backs, Jack Hillman and Phil Ba
ker, nursed injuries which will
probably keep them from playing
for more than a few minutes in Sat
urday's game against the Panthers,
University of Pittsburgh's two in
jured stars, Captain Paul Reider and
Mike Sebastian, skyrocketed their
team's already bright chances of
victory by sharing the right half
back post in an hour and a half
practice drill yesterday afternoon.
Pitt Favored
Justifiable odds of 3-1 favoritism
were quoted on the Panthers yes
terday, for while the Indian team
was dropping games to U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., and Washington, tying
California, and winning over Olym
pic Club, San Francisco, Oregon
State, West Coast Army, and the
California Aggies, Pittsburgh ham
mered out remarkable victories over
Notre Dame, Army, Pennsylvania,
Ohio Northern, West Virginia, Du
quesne, and Carnegie Tech. The
1932 Panthers are undefeated, but
were held to scoreless ties by Ohio
State and Nebraska.
While the Panthers were coasting
to a 6-0 victory over Carnegie Tech
last Saturday, Stanford engaged in
one of the most ferocious Big Games
that Indian-Bear gridiron competi
tion has produced. Pittsburgh's first
string players had little work to do;
but Stanford's regulars battled so
hard that many of them were forced
to leave the game from exhaustion.
Following closely on the three
stinging conference defeats suffered
at the hands of U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Washington, the scoreless Big Game
(with its breath-taking, savagely
fought ending) provided an emo
tional climax to the Indian season.
Not only physical superiority, but
psychological advantage is on Pitts
burgh's side, for even the masterful
"Pop" Warner will find it well-nigh
impossible to bring his men buck to
the same mental attitude which en
abled them to play so well last Sat
