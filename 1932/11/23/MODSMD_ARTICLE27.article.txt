# THE 						GIRL IN WHITE
## 
### 
Hoy! Who's the girl?
All in white she was, from her smart little military cap
down llio length of her straight white skirt to her trim little
shoes. All in white, and in her hand she carried a silver
headed stick now in her right hand, now in her left, now
behind her, now whirling in the air. She could twirl that
baton with the best of collegiate drum majors. She led the
Stanford band out of the tunnel at California's Memorial
Stadium. She went briskly through the band's pro-game
maneuvers, never faltering.
Who's the girl? The whisper ran around the stadium.
California people and old Stanford gratis gaspedâ€”here
was a Stanford woman who was doing the very unexpected
and doing it very well. If the whisper stirred the rest of
the 7<S,()(K) spectators, it fairly swept the Stanford rooting
section. The men under the red and white hats were star
tied, and not a little pleased, at the sight of what they sup
posed to he a Stanford co-ed twirling the baton. Members
of llic Five Hundred craned their necks to see which of
their number was missing, seeking to identify the trim little
figure on the field.
But the Five Hundred cannot claim the feminine drum
major who so captivated the crowd at Berkeley. She was
Miss Alice Swift of Redwood City, leader of tlie student
band at Setpioia High School, and she has been the protege
of Bill Okkor, Stanford's drum major, for three years. The
Daii.y, on behalf of Stanford students, thanks Miss Swift
for her services at Berkeley, which so added to the color
and attractiveness of the Stanford hand's performance.
Now another question why not a Stanford woman ? If
Bill Okker could teach one girl to twirl the baton so well,
couldn't he teach a Stanford woman? The Five Hundred,
because of the smallness of their number, cannot make the
colorful showing at games which California co-eds pro
vide, hut couldn't they furnish one of their number each
year to do for the Stanford band what Miss Swift did last
Saturday?
