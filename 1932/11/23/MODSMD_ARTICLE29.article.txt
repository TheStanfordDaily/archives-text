## DAY OF THANKS 
### 
Thanksgiving Day is good psychol
ogy even if it isn't good for thanks
giving. The very fact that we have
such a holiday seems to place us
under moral responsibility to render
thanks. It becomes unAmerican its
well as positively indecent not to
work ourselves up into a grateful
lather. '

The fact that the rent is due, stocks
are falling, the new models in autos
are coming out, banks are failing,
jobs are following suit—is held to be
no bar to sincere and reverent
thanks. The person who presumes
to think that Thanksgiving Day 1932
is more of a memorial to 1929 than
anything else is asked to think of
the Pilgrims. Yes, let's look at the
Pilgrims.

This group was so God-conscious
that they couldn't enjoy the com
forts of England. So they came to a
wilderness. At which wilderness they
we re scalped, starved, and eaten
alive by Massachusetts mosquitos.
Then, they had a boom. In compari
son to what they had gone through,
they were in the "pink" and out ol
the "red." They were lucky to be
alive. And they thanked God for
their luck. And so, anyone who is
alive today is presumed also to have
something to be thankful for—the
fact that he is alive. Thus, the
viscious circle is initiated. Ii you
are alive to be thankful; you have
automatically something to be thank
ful about—the fact that you are
alive to be thankful.

Hence, it is absolutely impossible

not to be thankful tomorrow. If you
eat roast-beef, be glad it isn't wein
ers. If you are reduced to hot-dogs,
be glad it isn't hash. If your gusta
tory festivities are limited to hash,
thank the Creator it isn't Union
meat-loaf. And if you haven't even
Union meat-loaf, well, be thankful
anyway. Forget that in 1929 it was
turkey white-meat and pheasant
giblets. Try and forget.
But actually, there is still much
to be thankful for . . .
Praise Him from Whom all bless
ings flow that all the dire things
that the G.O.P. promised with a
Democratic victory have not been
realized —at least not yet.
That the Big Game ended" in a tie
making it impossible for Stanford to
LOSE all of her major games re
gardless of the outcome of the com
ing Pittsburgh battle.
That you did not have to sit on
ihe edge of the rooting section Sat
urday where the freshman women
who get* SO excited are invariably
yelling "Stanford Varsity Six"—in
stead of rah, rah, rah, etc., etc., etc.
That all professors do not assign
exams and papers for next Monday
because the clever rascals know that
a "vacation" is in the offing.
.And always bow in reverent
thanks to the Maker of all things
because turkeys do not have fish
bones tucked away in the wings.
In short, always remember the
1932 Republican campaign cheer,
"Things might have been worse."
Be thankful. —Abe Mellink^ff
