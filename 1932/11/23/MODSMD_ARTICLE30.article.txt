## A 						NOTE ON TWO HEARTS IN WALTZ TIME: 
### 
A third revival of that most de
lightful of German films, Zwei
Hertzen in Drei-Viertel Takt, begins
at the Filmarte Theatre in San
Francisco next Saturday.
After the tremendous amount of
enthusiastic comment which the film
aroused it might be wise to add a
warning to the eulogies. The film
is neither weighty nor magnificent;
in its simplicity lies its charm. It
avoids sentimentality and maintains
a consistent comic tone. Its music is
tuneful and gay—the film's chief
attraction.
While the film as a backstage
story may suffer in the deluge of
like tales, it will never be harmed
by comparison with them. It has an
individuality which even the better
of the others —among them Ronny
and Gitta Discovers Her Heart —do
not possess.
Therefore, when you see the film
—and I trust that it will enjoy in
this revival the popularity it de
servedly has in the past—do not ex
pect more than it offers: spirited fox
trots, warmly melodic German
waltzes; a plot which is enhanced
by good and zestful acting; and pro
duction which is effective if not
ostentatious in the manner of Holly
wood's glorified musicals.
The music by Robert Stolz is
played by Marek Weber's orchestra;
the chief actors are Walter Janssen,
Willy Forst, and Irene Elsinger.
