The Editor, Sir: •
If my memory is correct, the Daily
has, in two separate editorials,
doubted the value of two student
traditions—the mud fight and the
Big Game Bonfire. The Daily has,
on both occasions, advocated dis
continuing these traditions because
of the lack of spirit displayed. Per
mit me to make two observations.
First, "wet blanket" editorials are
the best means of killing forever
the desired spirit among the im
pressionable frosh. Secondly, as the
functions in question seemed to a
spectator to be about as interesting
this year as usual, one wonders
why the editor was so disappointed
in them. Could it be simply a re
flection of his own pessimistic
spirit?'
Yours very truly,
