Is Pittsburgh Stadium big enough
o star two All-American halfbacks?
The showdown comes Saturday
fternoon when Stanford's Ernie
'addel and Pittsburgh's Warren
Idler, both right halfbacks, line up
or a game that may answer the
casing query: Which is better—the
'acific Coast's finest running back
r the East's most powerful"ground
ainer"?
Not a few who have watched the
ndians in their last four contests
xpect Bill Sim to make it a three
ornered fight—but if Caddel's as
tonishing performance against Dart
louth last year is a true indication
f what he can do against Eastern
ompetition, and Heller can slash
ff a few of the runs that have
errorized. Panther opposition in
very game this year, these two
peedsters will have no trouble in
lutclassing their teammates.
SUPERIOR RESERVE MA
TERIAL all hut won the Big
Game for California, and if
Pittsburgh wins Saturday af
ternoon, a good portion of the
credit for victory may he
chalked up to this factor.
Against Nebraska, the Panthers
started a "shock troop" eleven
which had as much success
against the sturdy Cornlmskers
as the Pittsburgh first-stringers.
On this "second team" was Cap
tain Paul Reider, who has been
forced to concede left halfback
honors to Mike Sebastian.
But Reider and Sebastian,
both heroes of the Notre Dame
game, may not play Saturday
afternoon. Their injuries balance
the hooks in some measure with
Stanford's wounded fullbacks,
Jack Ilillman and Phil Baker.
Bui the third-string Pitt loft -
halfback, O'Dell, is a more ex
perienced player than Stan
ford's third fullback, Wes
Stevens.
AND ANOTHER WINNETKA
IIRL has made good.
We refer of course to Helen Mar
;iierite Fulton, 152 Roble, Box 2044
who as captain of the freshman
(iris' hockey team has convinced
V.A.A. enthusiasts (!) that she is
jiiite an athlete. A copy of the
'hicago Tribune informs me that
tfiss Fulton ranks second only to
vfrs. Dorothy Weisel Hack among
.Vindy City tennis players; is paired
vith the latter on the first women's,
loubles team; and tops this off with J
slumber I ranking in the girls' j
ingles division of which she is the j
lational champion.
WE ARE WILLING TO
WAGER that at least one of the
following games will produce
"the biggest upset of the 1932
season": I
Army-Notre Dame (Ramblers
big favorites, but the old Mule
is plenty stubborn).
U.S.C.-Washington (The Tro- ,
jaiis may be unable to find the
goal line under all that Seattle
mud).
Brown-Colgate (That un
scored-on record of Andy Kerr's
Red Raiders is in a precarious
spot).
STANFORD-PITTSBURGH???
