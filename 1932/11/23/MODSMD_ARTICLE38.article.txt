# Five Technical K.O.'s in Boxing Preliminaries
## FOWLER JARS LEE TO TAKE FASTEST BOUT OF TOURNEY Munday, Quinn, Baer, Saxe, Draper, Hinman, Blair, Stephens Win 
### Jack Beach 
Fifteen hard-fought bouts fea
tured the preliminaries in the no
vice boxing tournament held last
night in the Encina Gym. Univer
sity boxing fans were brought to
their feet several times by the furi
ous battles the young fighters put
up. Five of the contests were ended
by technical knockouts, three were
so even that Referee Schall had to
decide the contest after the judges
had voted a draw, and the remain
ing seven bouts resulted in close
decisions.
All the boxers showed plenty of
fight and exhibited many original
styles of fighting. Several resorted
to weaving, others used a crouch,
and many forgot all they had j
learned and resorted to real old- j
fashioned slugging. A few of the
battlers looked very good and
should aid the varsity this coming
season.
Best Bout
The best bout of the evening was |
between Bill Lee and Fred Fowler j
in the quarter-finals of the middle
weight class. Fowler started fast
and built up a good lead in the first
round, but Lee came back in the
second and jarred Fowler with a
right to the jaw. The third round
was quite even, with both fighters
trying hard to land a winning
punch. Fowler had a slight edge
and was awarded the fight.
In the other quarter final of the
middleweight division Thornton
Hinman won a close decision over
De Ver. Oscar Baer won his match
and John Fowler drew a bye to put
both of these men in the finals for
this class.
Munday Looks Good
Waldo Munday looked like the
' class of the welterweights when he
i stopped J. Weinberger in 20 sec
i onds. Bob Quinn also fought very
| well when he eliminated Max Shaf
fer by a technical k.o. in the second 1
; round. S. Draper won from Briggs, !
; and Harry Saxe took a decision;
over Ben Cave to earn their places |
I in the finals.
I The lightweight division was the j
! other class that required elimina- j
j tion bouts, with Spencer Nelson, j
| Stuart Stephens, Hayaen Henderson, i
| and Bob Blair winning their;
! matches. Stephens' fight with John
i Fisher was very close and could
have been called either way, but
Schall gave the decision to Stephens
by virtue of his ring generalship.
Bob Blair staged an exciting fight
when he outfought Marshall, his
1 larger opponent, and won by a de
| cisive margin.
