# Cleanup Squad To Efface Last 'C' On Campus
## 
### 
Had it not been for an eagle
eyed reporter hot on the trail
of something or other, the Cor
poration would still he ignor
ant of the giant twenty-foot
"C" at the intersection by the
Art Gallery. Surprised, the
"yard" said they thought they
had effaced all the "C's" and
promised to eradicate all trace
of the offending initial by noon
today.
No real damage was suffered
at the hands of the California
invaders, other than a gigantic
"C" burnt in the center of the
east lawn in front of the Li
brary. The unexpectedness of
the Blue and 'Gold visit ex
plains the apparent success of
the Cal students.
