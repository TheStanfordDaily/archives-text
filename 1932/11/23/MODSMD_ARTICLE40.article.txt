# GRID CLASHES THIS WEEK TO DECIDE CLAIMS TO SECTIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
## 
### FRITZ GOODWIN 
All the loose footballs which have
been rolling inadvertently about the !
nation's gridirons this fall bounce!
into the end zone tomorrow andj
Saturday—the end zone of a football
season being that part in which na- :
tional and sectional championships j
are decided.
In the Far East, Brown and Col- j
gate meet for whatever kind of a
title the Pittsburgh Panthers may
leave the winner. Brown, undefeat
ed in a schedule which included
Yale, Harvard, Holy Cross, and j
Columbia, should succeed in bowl- j
ing over Andy Kerr's Colgate
eleven, the only major team in the
country which boasts an uncrossed |
goal line. That season's total of 243
for Colgate and 0 for opponents is
very nice, but not so spectacular, j
since the stiff est opposition Kerr's j
men have faced this fall was of
ffred by New York U. and Syra
cuse, two elevens which are none j
too good this season.
Stanford-Pitt
Pop Warner's boys of local parts 1
will get a great share of the Eastern '
limelight when they tangle with the j
I aforementioned Panthers of Pitts
j burgh. Pitt presents a much more
j impressive pre-game record than
the Indians, having defeated eight
Strang and fairly strong opponents,
including Notre Dame, and kept the
| slate clean by holding the Nebraska
! Cornhuskers to one of those double
! goose-egg affairs.
i Notre Dame and the Army meet
Saturday for what might have been
the championship contest of the
East, had not Pitt upset both teams
| earlier in the season. Notre Dame,
[not the rambling caterpillar of for
| mer years, still ought to have
I enough punch to win the old Army
J game. Pennsylvania vs. Cornell
should offer a classic, when the two
I schools meet for whatever consola
j tion they can get out of a late sea
j son victory.
Troy Out For Title
The Tennessee-Kentucky battle
will be worth listening to on the
radio, and Centenary, a cinch to
beat Arkansas in the last game on
I the schedule, will finish the year

undefeated and untied.
Moving to the Pacific Coast with- \
out a look at the Corn Belt, where
Michigan holds all the reins, we'll
find El Trojan, in all probability
and barring a soggy field, winning
another coast title from the Huskies
at Seattle. U.C.L.A., of course, is
still in the running, unless the '
Washington State Cougars beat
them, which seems likely. Even if j
the Bruins win, they still must beat j
the Huskies a week later, and even i
if the Bruins win that one, look for !
Southern California to play Auburn ,
01 Brown or Michigan in the Rose
Bowl on New Year's Day.

will get a great share of the Eastern '
limelight when they tangle with the j
I aforementioned Panthers of Pitts
j burgh. Pitt presents a much more
j impressive pre-game record than
the Indians, having defeated eight
Strang and fairly strong opponents,
including Notre Dame, and kept the
| slate clean by holding the Nebraska
! Cornhuskers to one of those double
! goose-egg affairs.
i Notre Dame and the Army meet
Saturday for what might have been
the championship contest of the
East, had not Pitt upset both teams
| earlier in the season. Notre Dame,
[not the rambling caterpillar of for
| mer years, still ought to have
I enough punch to win the old Army
J game. Pennsylvania vs. Cornell
should offer a classic, when the two
I schools meet for whatever consola
j tion they can get out of a late sea
j son victory.
Troy Out For Title
The Tennessee-Kentucky battle
will be worth listening to on the
radio, and Centenary, a cinch to
beat Arkansas in the last game on
I the schedule, will finish the year

undefeated and untied.
Moving to the Pacific Coast with- \
out a look at the Corn Belt, where
Michigan holds all the reins, we'll
find El Trojan, in all probability
and barring a soggy field, winning
another coast title from the Huskies
at Seattle. U.C.L.A., of course, is
still in the running, unless the '
Washington State Cougars beat
them, which seems likely. Even if j
the Bruins win, they still must beat j
the Huskies a week later, and even i
if the Bruins win that one, look for !
Southern California to play Auburn ,
01 Brown or Michigan in the Rose
Bowl on New Year's Day.
All the loose footballs which have
been rolling inadvertently about the !
nation's gridirons this fall bounce!
into the end zone tomorrow andj
Saturday—the end zone of a football
season being that part in which na- :
tional and sectional championships j
are decided.
In the Far East, Brown and Col- j
gate meet for whatever kind of a
title the Pittsburgh Panthers may
leave the winner. Brown, undefeat
ed in a schedule which included
Yale, Harvard, Holy Cross, and j
Columbia, should succeed in bowl- j
ing over Andy Kerr's Colgate
eleven, the only major team in the
country which boasts an uncrossed |
goal line. That season's total of 243
for Colgate and 0 for opponents is
very nice, but not so spectacular, j
since the stiff est opposition Kerr's j
men have faced this fall was of
ffred by New York U. and Syra
cuse, two elevens which are none j
too good this season.
