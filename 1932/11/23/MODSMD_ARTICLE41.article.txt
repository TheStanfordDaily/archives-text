# Melone Called Star's Double
## 
### 
Woody Melone, Card poloist,
I seems to be a man of destiny. At
! least that's what his teammates
j think after Willie Tevis, San Mateo
j player, told the crowd at Friday's
match that Melone was "the very
picture" of Tommy Hitchcock,
world's greatest polo player. "Why,
he even rides like him," said Tevis.
Now Melone has been playing
some good polo this season, but he
still has an unofficial handicap of
one goal, as compared to Hitch
cock's rating of 10 goals.
