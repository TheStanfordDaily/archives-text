Drofnats made an almost successful
attempt to get into the lobby here
this afternoon. For four dawns now

out of the Garden Room, and back
to the Stanford campus.

on tomorrow's games so I can pay ,
my ginger ale bill and get the hell |
out of here." If Arbuthnot loses its
annual Thanksgiving Day battle '
