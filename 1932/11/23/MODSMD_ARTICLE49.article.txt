Opening a series of informal con- [
ferences to aid students in study
habits and concentration. Dr. C. Gil
-1 belt Wrenn last night spoke before
, a group of students in Room 201. j
Last night's talk was a repetition
of the morning meeting when
i Wrenn discussed methods of speedy
reading. Quick reading is nothing
more than the reading of meaning- {
ful words, omitting the unessentials,
Wrenn said. When reading a sen
tence, the student should attempt to
pick out three or four fixation points
that will bring out only the impor- ;
tant sections. The sentence is a uni- i
fied thought and should be dealt j
5 with as such, not as a series of j

: words.
Most slow and poor reading,
j Wrenn said, can be traced to bad
mechanical habits, inadequate vo
j cabulary, too many fixation points,
i and the vocalizing of words. To
remedy these defects the students
should practice reading simple, fa
miliar material with the idea of
I gaining speed rather than meaning.
To keep the group small and in
formal, thus giving the students an
opportunity to ask questions, Pro
fessor Wrenn said that the confer
j ences would continue io be held in
| two sections. The next gatherings
j will be held at 11 and 7 o'clock next
j Tuesday.
