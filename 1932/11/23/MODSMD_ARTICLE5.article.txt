## 
### 
Representatives from ten North
■ ern California and Nevada Interna
-1 tional Relations clubs, totaling a
group of 58, terminated their two
day conference on the campus yes
! terday. Their final meeting was ad
journed after a 2 to 4 o'clock review
I session in the Little Theatre.
Summaries and conclusions of the
| three two-day round tables were
j given by their respective chairmen.
! Amy Heminway Jones, general di
! rector of the Carnegie Foundation
j which sponsors 280 American and
the 210 foreign branches of this
club, spoke on the work of these
j organizations and voiced her pleas
ure at the success of this confer
ence. Chairman of the conference
I and president of Stanford's club,
Crompton Bangs Jr., adjourned the
conference.
Favor Hcrriot Plan
I In the discussion group on ."In
j ternational Co-operation Through
' Conferences" the work was concen
trated on Disarmament Conferences
and concluded that the French Her
riot Plan was most satisfactory.
They advocated a movement origi
nating in the ranks of the working
! men and students which would pro
pose the completion of disarmament
and the establishment of guaran
teed security by means of an inter
national police force and economic
I policies isolating" nations desiring to
: fight.
Versailles Treaty
The round table on "The Ver- (
sailles Treaty in Retrospect" reported
indecision and heated arguments on :
j some points because two Stanford :
i representatives, one a German sup- j
porter of the Nazi party and the
| other a native of Poland, repre
i sented those opposing factions.
Their conclusions were that: (1)
Germany was not responsible for
1 the Great War, as confessed even in
- French newspapers today, and
| should therefore pay only 750 mil
| lion dollars, as agreed in the Lau- j
: sanne Treaty, instead of the 1331
j billion dollars of the Versailles
treaty; (2) Disarmament should be
advanced as advocated by the round
! table on that issue; and. (3) The
Polish Corridor issue is dead, but
' one of the touchiest points of Eu- |
i rope.
Japanese Situation
That the Sino-Japanese situation,
! concerning Manchuria is due tq j
Japan's governmental organization
! was the decision of the round table !
! on that subject. The king and the
j army and navy stand as a separate !
unit of the government aside from
| the constitutional government, which
j has charge of internal dealings and
i diplomatic affairs. There is no cor
; relation, and this resulted in the
! war.
At next year's conference on the j
j campus there may be represented j
twenty colleges instead of ten, for
! the clubs are increasing in number,
! and the clubs of Southern California |
i colleges may attend next autumn.
Those represented this year be- i
I sides Stanford were: Mills College,
University of California, University j
jof San Francisco, University of j
i Nevada, San Francisco State Teach
j ers College, San Jose State Teach
j crs College, University of Santa i
, Clara, the State Agricultural Col
lege at Davis, and Chico State
Teachers College.

Representatives from ten North

-1 tional Relations clubs, totaling a
group of 58, terminated their two
day conference on the campus yes
! terday. Their final meeting was ad
journed after a 2 to 4 o'clock review
I session in the Little Theatre.
Summaries and conclusions of the
| three two-day round tables were
j given by their respective chairmen.
! Amy Heminway Jones, general di
! rector of the Carnegie Foundation
j which sponsors 280 American and
the 210 foreign branches of this

j organizations and voiced her pleas
ure at the success of this confer

Favor Hcrriot Plan
I In the discussion group on ."In
j ternational Co-operation Through
' Conferences" the work was concen
trated on Disarmament Conferences
and concluded that the French Her
riot Plan was most satisfactory.
They advocated a movement origi
nating in the ranks of the working
! men and students which would pro
pose the completion of disarmament
and the establishment of guaran
teed security by means of an inter
national police force and economic
I policies isolating" nations desiring to
: fight.
Versailles Treaty
The round table on "The Ver- (
sailles Treaty in Retrospect" reported
indecision and heated arguments on :
j some points because two Stanford :
i representatives, one a German sup- j
porter of the Nazi party and the
| other a native of Poland, repre
i sented those opposing factions.
Their conclusions were that: (1)
Germany was not responsible for
1 the Great War, as confessed even in
- French newspapers today, and
| should therefore pay only 750 mil
| lion dollars, as agreed in the Lau- j
: sanne Treaty, instead of the 1331
j billion dollars of the Versailles
treaty; (2) Disarmament should be
advanced as advocated by the round
! table on that issue; and. (3) The
Polish Corridor issue is dead, but
' one of the touchiest points of Eu- |
i rope.
Japanese Situation
That the Sino-Japanese situation,
! concerning Manchuria is due tq j
Japan's governmental organization
! was the decision of the round table !
! on that subject. The king and the
j army and navy stand as a separate !
unit of the government aside from
| the constitutional government, which
j has charge of internal dealings and
i diplomatic affairs. There is no cor
; relation, and this resulted in the
! war.
At next year's conference on the j
j campus there may be represented j
twenty colleges instead of ten, for
! the clubs are increasing in number,
! and the clubs of Southern California |
i colleges may attend next autumn.
