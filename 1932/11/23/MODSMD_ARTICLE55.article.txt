# ‘Y’ ASKS AID IN RUMMAGE SALE
## 
### 
A plea that those going home for i
Thanksgiving collect all the un
wanted articles of any sort and
bring them back to the campus for ;
the Y.W.C.A. rummage sale on De- 1
cember 9, was voiced yesterday by j
Barbara Binns, Finance chairman.
"We are short fifty dollars on our I
budget in spite of drastic economy,"
she declared, "and we hope to make
it up by this sale. lis success de
pends entirely on the amount of i
material we are able to collect, and ,
we want anything from knick- i
knacks to clothes."
Anyone who has anything to give |
and has not been approached by one j
of the committee working on the j
sale is asked to telephone the
Y.W.C.A. rooms either today or j
after vacation is over, and someone I
will call to get it.
