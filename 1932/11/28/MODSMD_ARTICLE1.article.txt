# SEAL CAMPAIGN WILL BEGIN ON CAMPUS TODAY
## Arrangements Made For Proceeds To Go To Rest Homes $250 IS SET AS GOAL Aynesworth Named Head Of University Drive 
### 
O(Torod the opportunity of partici
pating in a Christmas Seal drive for
the local community's benefit ex
clusively, Stanford students starting
today will be asked to contribute to
such a drive during the next two
weeks.
Although Christmas Seals are be
ing sold throughout the country in
the annual national anti-tuberculosis
Ciimpaign, special arrangements have
been made that permit the use of
the proceeds of the Stanford drive
for the support of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes. The flu epi
demic and the financial straits of
many Stanford students make such
support of the Rest Homes impera
tively necessary.
Sell for Penny
Mrs. Royce Reed Long has ap
pointed Anna Louise Aynesworth
general student chairman of the
drive. The seals sell for one penny
apiece, and it has hitherto been the
custom to ask each student to pur
chase a dollar's worth of them.
This year, however, announces
Miss Aynesworth, the desired per
capita minimum has been reduced
to 25 cents. Each student will be
expected to contribute at least this
much, and more will be appreciated
from those who can afford it.
Co-operation Needed
Former Stanford Christmas Seal
drives have had $300 as their goal,
but, because of the depression, it has
been decided that the accumulation
of $250 will be ample. Such a figure
can only be reached through the co
operation of the entire student body.
Eunice Force and Jack Redh6ad
have been appointed by Miss Aynes
worth to head the sorority and fra
ternity drives, respectively. Dick
Van Wagenen in Toyon, Richard
Hattrup in Branner, Dick Eaton in
Sequoia, and Claude Calloway in
Encina have charge of the various
men's dormitories. Fred Jing will
manage the drive in the Chinese
Students' Club.
Ruble Organized
Zoe Ann Hill, who is planning a
concentrated drive in Roble, has al
ready organized the staff that will
work with her. The list includes
Dorothy Baker, Florence Cohen,
Marion Harper, Jennet Henderson,
Marjorie Hutchings, Virginia King,
Florence LeCron, Winifred Lem
kau, Doris Tucker, Dorothy Sweet,
and Mary Ann Wheeler.

apiece, and it has hitherto been the
custom to ask each student to pur
chase a dollar's worth of them.
This year, however, announces
Miss Aynesworth, the desired per
capita minimum has been reduced
to 25 cents. Each student will be
expected to contribute at least this
much, and more will be appreciated
from those who can afford it.
Co-operation Needed
Former Stanford Christmas Seal
drives have had $300 as their goal,
but, because of the depression, it has
been decided that the accumulation
of $250 will be ample. Such a figure
can only be reached through the co
operation of the entire student body.
Eunice Force and Jack Redh6ad
have been appointed by Miss Aynes
worth to head the sorority and fra
ternity drives, respectively. Dick
Van Wagenen in Toyon, Richard
Hattrup in Branner, Dick Eaton in
Sequoia, and Claude Calloway in
Encina have charge of the various
men's dormitories. Fred Jing will
manage the drive in the Chinese
Students' Club.
Ruble Organized
Zoe Ann Hill, who is planning a
concentrated drive in Roble, has al
ready organized the staff that will
work with her. The list includes
Dorothy Baker, Florence Cohen,
Marion Harper, Jennet Henderson,
Marjorie Hutchings, Virginia King,
Florence LeCron, Winifred Lem
kau, Doris Tucker, Dorothy Sweet,
and Mary Ann Wheeler.
O(Torod the opportunity of partici
pating in a Christmas Seal drive for
the local community's benefit ex
clusively, Stanford students starting
today will be asked to contribute to
such a drive during the next two
weeks.
Although Christmas Seals are be
ing sold throughout the country in
the annual national anti-tuberculosis
Ciimpaign, special arrangements have
been made that permit the use of
the proceeds of the Stanford drive
for the support of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes. The flu epi
demic and the financial straits of
many Stanford students make such
support of the Rest Homes impera
tively necessary.
Sell for Penny
Mrs. Royce Reed Long has ap
pointed Anna Louise Aynesworth
general student chairman of the
drive. The seals sell for one penny
apiece, and it has hitherto been the
custom to ask each student to pur
chase a dollar's worth of them.
