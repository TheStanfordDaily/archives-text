# CHOIR TO SING TOMORROW AT CONCERT EVENT
## Hall Johnson Leads Negro Chorus In Spirituals And Ballads 
### Ellamae Dodds 
Led by Hall Johnson, the negro
chorus which helped to make
"Green Pastures" an outstanding
success will present the second con
cert of the A.S.S.U. series in the
Stanford Pavilion at 8:20 o'clock to
morrow night.
The chorus is made up of 16 per
sons, 9 men and 7 women, all of
them descendants of the old South
ern negro slaves. Born and raised
in the South, the members of the
chorus have heard the negro songs
and spirituals from earliest child
hood. It is probably for this reason
that they are able to present the
true negro music, not only spirituals,
but also work-songs, ballads, songs
of the levee, the rock-pile, and the
cotton field, lullabies and songs
about animalsâ€”the music of the
negro in his lighter moments.
Johnson From Georgia
Their conductor, Hall Johnson,
was born and brought up in the
center of Georgia and taught by his
grandmother the melodies of her
childhood. He combines the influ
ences of a childhood during which
the spirituals were ground into his
fibre with the technical knowledge
of a trained musician. All the choral
arrangements used by his chorus
were especially written by Mr.
Johnson himself with an effort to
retain the spirit and primitive qual
ity of their origin. For his success
ful work in "Green Pastures," John
son received the 1930 Harmon award
for distinguished contribution to
music.
In New York the success of this
small chorus was sensational. At
their first concert critics hailed them
as giving for the first time in a
generation the true negro music.
Public demand to hear them again
was so insistent that it was neces
sary to arrange other recitals im
mediately. Since that time the
chorus has been scoring one suc
cess after another on the concert
stage throughout the nation.
Chorus Lauded
Such a discriminating musician as
Walter Damrosch, leader of the New
York Symphony, lauded the group
for "fine precision, beautiful tone
quality, and above all . . . deep
inner emotion which fairly sweeps
the listeners along."
