### 
Continuing his series of informal
lectures on methods of study, Dr.
C. Gilbert Wrenn, Stanford voca
tional guidance secretary, will speak
twice on "Habits of Concentration" j
in Room 201 at 11 and 7 o'clock
tomorrow.
Anyone may attend these infor

series was intended primarily for
new students. The lecture will be!
given twice to accommodate those
who might have a class or other
conflicting engagement at either of
the times the session will meet.
At the lecture tomorrow, students
who attended the previous discus- j
sion will report on concentration
problems and habits they have '
formed. 1
