# Job-Hunting Girls Join Cross-Country "Hikers"
## 
### SILVIA COWELL 
Hitchhiking across the continent
has joined the list of the formerly
solely masculine pursuits which
have been claimed for their own
sex by the "women's rights" enthu
siasts.
Emulating their fathers and
brothers, numbers of unemployed
girls stand on the highways of the
I country, and can even be seen fre
| quently on the Bayshore road,
j "thumbing" for rides with passing
motorists. Where are these girls
| going? The goal is any place where
' there is work to be done and paid
] for.
The accepted costume for the
, feminine hitchhiker is white duck
| pants or knickers and sweater. Bag
gage may consist of a gaily painted
| vanity box.
j All day long, girls who are foot
j sore and discontented enter the

[swinging doors of the Y.W.C.A. in
i San Francisco. College graduates
I are numbered among these young
! women seeking charity.
A typical case is that of the young
woman who sought shelter at the
San Francisco Y.W.C.A. late Friday
I evening. Having lost her job as a
| news photographer in New York,
she set forth on foot for Mexico
! City, where she hoped to find relief
in a foreign country. She arrived at
j the Mexican border only to find
, that workers could not enter the
i country. Mexico doesn't want our
j unemployed.
San Francisco seemed to offer the
i best possibility of a joh, so she con
-1 tinued on her hitchhiking journey.
Disillusionment awaited the girl in
San Francisco, for there, as in other
1 cities, charity and available jobs are
given only to natives of the city.
