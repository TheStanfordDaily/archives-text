# '500' COMPLETE CARNIVAL PLANS
## Women Will Lure Roughs With Novel Games 
### 
Plans for the fifth all-University j
Carnival, in which the "500" expect !
to raise $1000 for the relief of needy
studenls, have been completed and j
energy will be directed this week
toward actual preparation. Every
member of the "500" will have some j
part in the affair.
Ten concessions, including games j
I of skill and chance, a funhouse, one
| act plays, caricature and silhouette j
! drawings, will be offered for the de
lectation of the Stanford rough as ;
well as his more plutocratic neigh- !
bors. In addition to the time-hon- I
ored booths for basketball throws, j
I brewing light - globes Avith darts,,
I bowling, and such, imany original j
I ones have been promised.
Warner Cigarette Dummy
One of the main attractions will !
:be a life-sized dummy of "Pop" j
, Warner, stuffed with cigarettes, the
! number to be guessed by ambitious I
j roughs. Old-fashioned tin-types will
j be made for those who prefer to see
j themselves as the mirror rather than
| the caricaturist sees them. The
I freshmen are planning to sell pies,
! both apple and eskimo, at another
| booth.
Goal Set Higher
The goal of $1000 is more by $300
I lhan any Carnival in the past has
netted. The first, staged in 1929 for j
the benefit of the much talked-of j
j gym fund, brought in the disap- j
I pointing sum of $50. On their second I
attempt, in the summer quarter of !
| the same year, the students realized
I nearly $100. The peak was reached
,in 1930 when receipts were $900, j
the net profit $700. Last year, in
spite of the plea to aid unemployed
students, the Carnival produced
only $400.
With novel concessions, Gordon |
; Heche's music tempting dance- j
; hounds, and general interest already i
displayed, Ihe Carnival committee j
! expects this year to reach the $1000 j
| goal.

Plans for the fifth all-University j
Carnival, in which the "500" expect !
to raise $1000 for the relief of needy
studenls, have been completed and j
energy will be directed this week
toward actual preparation. Every
member of the "500" will have some j
part in the affair.
Ten concessions, including games j
I of skill and chance, a funhouse, one
| act plays, caricature and silhouette j
! drawings, will be offered for the de
lectation of the Stanford rough as ;
well as his more plutocratic neigh- !
bors. In addition to the time-hon- I
ored booths for basketball throws, j
I brewing light - globes Avith darts,,
I bowling, and such, imany original j
I ones have been promised.
Warner Cigarette Dummy
One of the main attractions will !
:be a life-sized dummy of "Pop" j
, Warner, stuffed with cigarettes, the
! number to be guessed by ambitious I
j roughs. Old-fashioned tin-types will
j be made for those who prefer to see
j themselves as the mirror rather than
| the caricaturist sees them. The
I freshmen are planning to sell pies,
! both apple and eskimo, at another
| booth.
Goal Set Higher
The goal of $1000 is more by $300
I lhan any Carnival in the past has
netted. The first, staged in 1929 for j
the benefit of the much talked-of j
j gym fund, brought in the disap- j
I pointing sum of $50. On their second I
attempt, in the summer quarter of !
| the same year, the students realized
I nearly $100. The peak was reached
,in 1930 when receipts were $900, j
the net profit $700. Last year, in
spite of the plea to aid unemployed
students, the Carnival produced
