# Cards Lose To Pitt 7-0; 'Pop' Lauds Winners
## 'Panthers Outplayed Indians Throughout,' Says Warner; Stanford Reverses and Passes Fail to Work; Heller, All-American, Only Scorer 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
''Pittsburgh has a great football team and outplayed Stanford through
out the game . . . Stanford had less trouble with the great U.S.C. twain
than with the Panthers today."
YVjtli these words, "Pop" Warner acknowledged the big superiority
shown by Pittsburgh's Panthers in handing Stanford its fourth defeat «>l
the season by a 7-0 score. The Indian coach declared that Pitt's attack
and defense were better than those of any team Stanford played during
the season.
Following closely upon three unexpected defeats and a savagely-fought
Big Game with California on the previous Saturday, Stanford's per
formance in holding the East's strongest team (apologies to Colgate) to a
single touchdown was highly commendable. But for the first time during

i»the 1932 campaign there was no
| question about the defeat.
Stanford was thoroughly beaten.
I The Panthers might just as well
l have scored two, or even three
touchdowns. Stanford's reverses and
spinners were spilled before they
had begun to move . . . ten of her
| thirteen passes were so carefully
j guarded that the receivers hadn't a
j ghost of a chance.
Pittsburgh's Offense
When Pittsburgh had the ball it
was a different story. Heller, Se
bastian, and Weinstock ripped tho
tired Stanford line to pieces, and
i kept on driving" until downed by
I some Indian back yards past the line
|of scrimmage. Straight plunges
i through the center of the line were
j as hard to stop as powerful lunges
! at tackle, and sweeping end runs.
Warren Heller lived up to his All-
American imputation in every re
spect, and scored the only touch
| down of the game. Pitt's rangy end,
Joe Skladany, downed the Stanford
safety men for no return following
each of Shanty Hogan's long kicks.
] The Panther center of the line,
j Hartwig, Tormy, and Onder, played
i their accustomed strong defensive
| game, but Pittsburgh's "unsung
| heroes" were two badly underrated
| tackles, Paul Cuba and Frank Wal
ton. They were in a large measure
responsible for stopping the Indian
attack so effectively that Ernie Cud
del could gain only two yards dur
ing the game, while losing twenty
seven yards in eight attempts.
Corbus Brilliant
! Climaxing a remarkable season as
t Stanford's most consistently brilliant
j player, Bill Corbus (whose name
• has been attracting Ail-American
J selectors lately) was the one Indian
.player who "looked a winner" while
i his team was going down to defeat.
I Don Colvin and Bill Doub, though
i outclassed by Pittsburgh's Skladany,
' played fine games. Doub was effec
tive in stopping Panther end runs
. . . Colvin sparkled in downing
safety men without return. Here
Laborde played his best game of
the season, stopping many of Sebas
tian's off-tackle runs. Working as a
unit, however, the Indian line was
| outplayed by Pittsburgh's forward
wall. It fell to Stanford's secondary
defense, featured by the savage
tackling of Ernie Caddel, to stop at
least half of the Pittsburgh plays.
Only once, in the fourth quarter,
did the Indian offense wilh
the same efficiency that brought
; "yardage victories" over California
and U.S.C. In quick succession
Stanford made its three first downs
of the game—Bill Sim smashed the
Pittsburgh line for thirteen yards,
Anderson tossed a 13-yard pass to
Gordy Campbell, and Ernie Caddel
took a short toss from Campbell,
which was good for a 30-yard gain.
The threat ended on Pittsburgh's
! twenty-five-yard line.
Ileller Scores
The Panthers' lone touchdown
came early in the first quarter when
Warren Heller smashed off tackle
I for two yards, shortly after a bullet
pass to Dailey had put the Panthers]
in a position to score. Pittsburgh j
threatened several other times dur- i
ing the game, and was "knocking j
at the door" when the game ended, j
A discouraging season record, the j
emotional and physical let-down !
following the California game, freez- :
ing weather, a cross-country train j

the year.
''Pittsburgh has a great football team and outplayed Stanford through
out the game . . . Stanford had less trouble with the great U.S.C. twain
than with the Panthers today."
YVjtli these words, "Pop" Warner acknowledged the big superiority
shown by Pittsburgh's Panthers in handing Stanford its fourth defeat «>l
the season by a 7-0 score. The Indian coach declared that Pitt's attack
and defense were better than those of any team Stanford played during
the season.
Following closely upon three unexpected defeats and a savagely-fought
Big Game with California on the previous Saturday, Stanford's per
formance in holding the East's strongest team (apologies to Colgate) to a
single touchdown was highly commendable. But for the first time during

i»the 1932 campaign there was no
| question about the defeat.
Stanford was thoroughly beaten.
I The Panthers might just as well
l have scored two, or even three
touchdowns. Stanford's reverses and
spinners were spilled before they
had begun to move . . . ten of her
| thirteen passes were so carefully
j guarded that the receivers hadn't a
j ghost of a chance.
Pittsburgh's Offense
When Pittsburgh had the ball it
was a different story. Heller, Se
bastian, and Weinstock ripped tho
tired Stanford line to pieces, and
i kept on driving" until downed by
I some Indian back yards past the line
|of scrimmage. Straight plunges
i through the center of the line were
j as hard to stop as powerful lunges
! at tackle, and sweeping end runs.
Warren Heller lived up to his All-
American imputation in every re
spect, and scored the only touch
| down of the game. Pitt's rangy end,
Joe Skladany, downed the Stanford
safety men for no return following
each of Shanty Hogan's long kicks.
] The Panther center of the line,
j Hartwig, Tormy, and Onder, played
i their accustomed strong defensive
| game, but Pittsburgh's "unsung
| heroes" were two badly underrated
| tackles, Paul Cuba and Frank Wal
ton. They were in a large measure
responsible for stopping the Indian
attack so effectively that Ernie Cud
del could gain only two yards dur
ing the game, while losing twenty
seven yards in eight attempts.
Corbus Brilliant
! Climaxing a remarkable season as
t Stanford's most consistently brilliant
j player, Bill Corbus (whose name
• has been attracting Ail-American
J selectors lately) was the one Indian
.player who "looked a winner" while
i his team was going down to defeat.
I Don Colvin and Bill Doub, though
i outclassed by Pittsburgh's Skladany,
' played fine games. Doub was effec
tive in stopping Panther end runs
. . . Colvin sparkled in downing
safety men without return. Here
Laborde played his best game of
the season, stopping many of Sebas
tian's off-tackle runs. Working as a
unit, however, the Indian line was
| outplayed by Pittsburgh's forward
wall. It fell to Stanford's secondary
defense, featured by the savage
tackling of Ernie Caddel, to stop at
least half of the Pittsburgh plays.
Only once, in the fourth quarter,
did the Indian offense wilh
the same efficiency that brought
; "yardage victories" over California
and U.S.C. In quick succession
Stanford made its three first downs
of the game—Bill Sim smashed the
Pittsburgh line for thirteen yards,
Anderson tossed a 13-yard pass to
Gordy Campbell, and Ernie Caddel
took a short toss from Campbell,
which was good for a 30-yard gain.
The threat ended on Pittsburgh's
! twenty-five-yard line.

came early in the first quarter when
Warren Heller smashed off tackle

''Pittsburgh has a great football team and outplayed Stanford through
out the game . . . Stanford had less trouble with the great U.S.C. twain
than with the Panthers today."
YVjtli these words, "Pop" Warner acknowledged the big superiority
shown by Pittsburgh's Panthers in handing Stanford its fourth defeat «>l
the season by a 7-0 score. The Indian coach declared that Pitt's attack
and defense were better than those of any team Stanford played during
the season.
Following closely upon three unexpected defeats and a savagely-fought
Big Game with California on the previous Saturday, Stanford's per
formance in holding the East's strongest team (apologies to Colgate) to a
single touchdown was highly commendable. But for the first time during

i»the 1932 campaign there was no
| question about the defeat.
Stanford was thoroughly beaten.
I The Panthers might just as well
l have scored two, or even three
touchdowns. Stanford's reverses and
spinners were spilled before they
had begun to move . . . ten of her
| thirteen passes were so carefully
j guarded that the receivers hadn't a
j ghost of a chance.
Pittsburgh's Offense
When Pittsburgh had the ball it
was a different story. Heller, Se
bastian, and Weinstock ripped tho
tired Stanford line to pieces, and
i kept on driving" until downed by
I some Indian back yards past the line
|of scrimmage. Straight plunges
i through the center of the line were
j as hard to stop as powerful lunges
! at tackle, and sweeping end runs.
Warren Heller lived up to his All-
American imputation in every re
spect, and scored the only touch
| down of the game. Pitt's rangy end,
Joe Skladany, downed the Stanford
safety men for no return following
each of Shanty Hogan's long kicks.
] The Panther center of the line,
j Hartwig, Tormy, and Onder, played
i their accustomed strong defensive
| game, but Pittsburgh's "unsung
| heroes" were two badly underrated
| tackles, Paul Cuba and Frank Wal
ton. They were in a large measure
responsible for stopping the Indian
attack so effectively that Ernie Cud
del could gain only two yards dur
ing the game, while losing twenty
seven yards in eight attempts.
Corbus Brilliant
! Climaxing a remarkable season as
t Stanford's most consistently brilliant
j player, Bill Corbus (whose name
• has been attracting Ail-American
J selectors lately) was the one Indian
.player who "looked a winner" while
i his team was going down to defeat.
I Don Colvin and Bill Doub, though
i outclassed by Pittsburgh's Skladany,
' played fine games. Doub was effec
tive in stopping Panther end runs
. . . Colvin sparkled in downing
safety men without return. Here
Laborde played his best game of
the season, stopping many of Sebas
tian's off-tackle runs. Working as a
unit, however, the Indian line was
| outplayed by Pittsburgh's forward
wall. It fell to Stanford's secondary
defense, featured by the savage
tackling of Ernie Caddel, to stop at
least half of the Pittsburgh plays.
Only once, in the fourth quarter,
did the Indian offense wilh
the same efficiency that brought
; "yardage victories" over California
and U.S.C. In quick succession
Stanford made its three first downs
of the game—Bill Sim smashed the
Pittsburgh line for thirteen yards,
Anderson tossed a 13-yard pass to
Gordy Campbell, and Ernie Caddel
took a short toss from Campbell,
which was good for a 30-yard gain.
The threat ended on Pittsburgh's
! twenty-five-yard line.
Ileller Scores
The Panthers' lone touchdown
came early in the first quarter when
Warren Heller smashed off tackle
I for two yards, shortly after a bullet
pass to Dailey had put the Panthers]
in a position to score. Pittsburgh j
threatened several other times dur- i
ing the game, and was "knocking j
