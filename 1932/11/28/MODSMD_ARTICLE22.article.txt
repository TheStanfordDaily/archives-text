SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 28 (/P)— I
Buster Crabbe, world's champion I
swimmer and ace of the University
of Southern California swim squad,
has been declared a professional by
the A.A.U. officials of Southern
California. According to Bill Mc- |
Wood Jr., San Francisco boy and |
Olympian who is attending school |
there, Crabbe has been set down
for his activities in the moving pic
ture industry.
Whether it was on account of his
accepting the part in the «"Lion
Man," a part that he won in the
movies in competition with several
other great athletes, among them
Ernie Caddel of Stanford, McWood
could not say.
