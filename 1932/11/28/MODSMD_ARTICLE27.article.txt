# THEY'RE HOMEWARD BOUND
## 
### 
Whenever a Stanford team lakes a drubbing sncli as
the present varsity look at the hands ot the Pittsburgh
Panthers Saturday there's a very good reason for it. The
reason for the Pittsburgh debacle, without many dissenting
opinions, was the Rig Game, a game in which Warner's
men plaved their hearts out against California's two var
sities.
Now those Stanford men are coming home. They have
ended a most discouraging season. They have worked
hard all fall. They have given their best and watched the
tides run against them. They have gone to Pittsburgh and
taken a severe beating. And now that they are on their
way home, what is Stanford going to do about it? 4
Not for reasons which involve anything so phantasmal
as "school spirit," but because those men, the individual
pla vers and coaches of the Cardinal varsity, deserve an
expression of heart-felt appreciation from the student
body, Hie Daily suggests to the Rally Committee and the
University at large that we meet the team at the Palo Alto
depot. A winning team gets its pictures in rotogravure sec
tions throughout the country. Its members get selected on
mythical all-star elevens, perhaps movie contracts, or other
opportunities to capitalize on their success.
What.is left for the football team not so fortunate, a
team which has tried just as hard as an eleven of cham
pionship caliber? All that is left for that team is what the
Stanford student body can give itâ€”a slap on the back.
