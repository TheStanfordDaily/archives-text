# METERS? NOT YET!

### 
Whether or not America is ready for the metric system
of measurement, the A.A.I . is going to use it in track meets
from now on, and that's that.
Such was the purport of the decision which last week
came out of New York, where the moguls who direct the
destinies of non-college amateur track were gathered in
their annual meeting.
While some may hail this as a master stroke in the
right direction, somehow il seems more to resemble a stab
in the dark, one more likely to miss than to hit its ob
jective.
The idea behind the move is great. This country ought
to be on the metric system in track, just as it ought to be
on the metric system in everything else. But until the U.S.
is on the metric system in everything else, it cannot be on
the metric system in track.
That is apparently what the A.A.f. lost sight of last
week. II is looking toward bigger and better Olympic
(lames, and bigger and belter U.S. scores in said Olympic
(lames. filiform meter recording of heights and distances
throughout the world would undoubtedly accomplish this
result, making world's and Olympic records comparable,
giving our athletes practice in meters, and attempting to
educate our sporting public into understanding just how
fast a 10.(5 "hundred" actually is.
Hut after all, in spite of the glamor of Ihe Games, the
individual enjoyment to athletes and fans that track pro
vides in college and high school meets from season to sea
son is Ihe important thing.
To substitute meter measurements now, when fan and
athlete alike think in yards and miles, would be to throw
the whole organization of track into a state of confusion
from which il might not recover for a decade.
The incentive of shooting at old records marked up in
figures tliev understand would be lost to athletes. Coaches
would be puzzled in trying to fathom just how good their
stars really were. And through it all, fans would sit 011 the
sidelines wondering what it was all about.
When, and if, future generations are taught to think
distance in meters, then, and then only, will il be time to
switch to meter measurements on the ovals of the nation.
Let us hope that the associations which regulate college
track, the X.C.A. and the 1.C.1-A., remain cool and inactive
in the face of this premature step of the A.A.f.
