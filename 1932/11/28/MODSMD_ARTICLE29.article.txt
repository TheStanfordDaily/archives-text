# A 						STANFORD NEED

### 
Ever since I'.Mll when Einar Ilolboell, a Danish postal
(lerk, conceived the idea of raising money for tubercular
children, there has been an annual Christmas Seal Drive.
Stanford ought to respond more heartily than ever this
year as the receipts from the local drive will go entirely to
the Stanford lies! Homes, Convalescent Home, and general
student welfare work. '
Every person connected with Stanford lias a pride in
I lie Stanford Convalescent Home. No one who lias seen the
line work that is being conducted at the Home can fail to
be impressed. Stanford's charity must be supported by
Stanford men and women.
Because of the recent tin epidemic, the Student Rest
Homes have been harder hit than ever before in regards t<*>
nuances. Everyone knows the benefits of these Homes. The
obvious answer is to support them by buying as many
Christmas Seals as that pocketbook can stand.
