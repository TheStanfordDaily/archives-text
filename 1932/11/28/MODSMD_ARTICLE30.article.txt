# BULL SESSION
## DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR 
### 
Fame and inches in the metropoli
tan press await all college editors
who will make serious enough
charges about football professional
ism. Not all can hope to be as suc
cessful as Reed Harris of Columbia
—but that is because not all ad
ministrations will make the com
motion that moved Harris from the
ranks of smuggling college editors
to national honor, fame, and mar
tyrdom.

But all can try, and the latest
aspirant is a chap from Oregon.
There is no reason to scoff except
that at the present our crusading
spirit is at a low ebb. Everyone
realizes that star athletes do not
drift to college under their own
power. No one still suspects surely
that ambitious alumni do not soften
the stony path of collegiate life for
these galloping gauchos of the grid
iron.

Whether the specific charges that
this particular editor '"hurls" !
(charges always are hurled) are !
true, we do not know. That "profes- j
sionalism" in a sense does not exist
at most colleges is probably true. J
But the question we now ask on a j
dreary Sunday morning is; "What |
about it?" We got tired of "wets"
telling us about flagrant drinking—
not because it wasn't flagrant nose
thumbing at the laws, but it was \
old news. To stop professionalism 1
is about as easy as stopping the :
consumption of intoxicating liquor, j
The people got tired of the sham !
and repealed the dry laws. Maybe i
the sham of professional athletics !
garbed in the lily-white raiments of j
amateurism will finally become so !

I boring and so disgusting that foot
| ball will be established on a legal
i business basis.
I
But one thing in particular an
; noyed me about this Oregon fel
; lew's charges. He holds that Stan-
I ford is paying "her boys" flat
1 monthly salaries. Whether this is
true, we don't' know. But if it is,
j we are not getting a dollar's work
for a dollar paid. The team is play
i ing pretty fair ball for an amateur
j outfit—but if we are paying $60 per
I month per man (as is charged) for
J the brand of football we have been
i getting this season, it seems that
' Stanford should change purchasing
j agents immediately.
| It seems mighty poor business
j anyway to pay football players a
i flat salary. If they are paid at all,
jit should be on a commission basis
I for results accomplished. Some sort
of a sliding scale could be devised.
| Pay should be in terms of yards
! gained, kicks blocked, with bonuses
! for scores made—and extra royal-
I ties for games won. Five dollars per
yard against U.S.C. might be fair
compensation — less of course for
easier opponents. We might even
run an amateur team against Cal
Aggies and West Coast Army.
As the market varied, so would
j the pay. Some autumns, we might
i be able to buy quarterbacks as low
' as $0.75 per yard. A savage tackle
j might be quoted at $9.25 per kick
i blocked. The thing is complicated,
j but once worked out would be re
! freshingly honest. And if what this
! Oregon editor charges is true, the
! plan would be a whole lot cheaper
ito the Universities concerned us
! well. • —Abe Mellinkoff
