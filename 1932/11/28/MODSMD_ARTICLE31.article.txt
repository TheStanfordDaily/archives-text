I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A
CHAIN GANG (Warners.)
(Although no longer at the Stan
ford Theatre, "I Am a Fugitive"
will doubtless make other appear
ances hereabouL and on that store
deserves consideration.)
By the simple but extraordinarily
effective expedient of selecting a
carefully typed cast which, even to
the females among it, was composed
of actual rather than cinema char
acters, and then directing this cast
—with the exception of the lead,
Paul Muni—to exaggerate brutality
and blandness, this was made a
crusading melodrama of power.
The chief objection to the prob
lem drama is its frequent dip into
sermonizing; there was preaching in
this picture, but instead of present
ing it as a direct, painfully obvious
and innocently humorous excuse
for the picture's brutality, the di
rection made it into infuriatingly
bigoted arguments by exponents of
the chain gang system.
The picture is directed for actu
ality until the chains are put on
Muni; thereafter everything is seen
as if through his dazed and enraged
eyes; but even then, by the neat
device of presenting the problem
from a biased point of view, drama
is maintained.
Production is fine; there are sev
eral too frequently used devices:
train wheels, a shifting map, a cal
endar. The convict chorus is the one
jarring Hollywood note.
The cast is excellent., Muni ex
ceptional; his is the one important
role amidst a number of others who
appear only momentarily. He is the
force which combines this astutely
pointed film. —Sandoe

THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR: A
Literary Newspaper. December
1932. (At the Stanford Bookstore.)
The second number of "The
American Spectator" is less flippant,
more scholarly, and as amusing as
the first. The paper resolves itself
chiefly into an attack upon the ebu
lence and pander to popular ac
claim which dominates American
criticism; as such it is, for the most
part, intelligent, stimulating, and
enlightening.
George Jean Nathan comments
upon two disadvantages of the dra
matic form—social introduction on
a stage of a group of characters,
and the undue prominence of one
set of characters while another has
the important lines, those which

carry the play on. The first of these
difficulties, in spite of Nathan's pro
tests to the contrary, may be over
come by imaginative writing, the
second by adept direction.
Jim Tully writes of an interview
with Arnold Bennett; his article is
-crudely casual, unorganized, strains
for literary "effect." Its chief char
acter is not Bennett, but Tully him
self.
Yvor Brown does not desire to
come to America because he might
find his mental picture of the coun
try mistaken—or "savagely true."
The comment is mildly amusing, im
material, and straggling.
Allan Langley remarks upon the
critical hailing of George Gershwin
as a great composer. But I doubt
that Gershwin himself has taken
his work as seriously as have both
critics and Mr. Langley: the spright
ly humor of his work would indi
cate that at any rate.
Dreiser mistakes American en
thusiasm for criticism; or, at least,
attacks as seriously as if he had, the
howlings of a long series of heavy
headed critical pimps.
O'Neill comments further upon
use of masks in drama, but his re
marks remain unclarified, fragment
ary. Cabell protests against the
failure of American authors to heed
the art of writing itself, in a mortal
preoccupation to Say Something.
Other contributors include Ernest
Boyd, Sean O'Casey, H. M. Tomlin
son, Hendrik Van Loon, Paul Mor
and, and L. M. Hussey. —Sandoe
