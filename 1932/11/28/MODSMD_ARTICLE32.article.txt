## 
### 
All the net tournaments now
being run off for either varsity and
freshman rankings, or for the Uni
versity novice class championships
are scheduled to go into their ad
vanced rounds this week, although
some of the novice matches are far
behind schedule.
In the upper ten rankings for the
varsity almost every man has played
three matches or more. Coughlin
stands out in this division with all
wins, while Chuck Otis trails right
behind in the number of victories.
This week will start the round
robin series in the doubles matches
with the same system as that used
in the singles. Each team will play
at least one match a week. In the
freshman tournament, the matches
go into the final rounds, with Law,
Clark, and Richardson as favorites.
