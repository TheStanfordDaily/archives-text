Nurses are queer creatures. They
know all the answers but won't tell
you what your temperature is. They
insist on giving you a handful of
pills you are certain were meant for
someone else. They think mustard
plasters are fun and that gargling is
just the jolliest old sport ever. They
feed you soup and fruit juice, then
keep a straight face when they in
quire ever so solemnly, "Are you
hungry?" They always want to rub
your back in the middle of a good
murder mystery. They pull you
through when you feel as if you are
only two notches this side and have
only to roll over to die comfortably.
They laugh at all your bum jokes.

"My, My! You're looking much
