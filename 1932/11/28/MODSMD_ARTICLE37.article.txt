What a beautiful example of the
glassblower's art—this thing called

up and down one face. Yes sir, the
glassblowers that made this cer

95.6, you have improved since yes
terday." If it says 103, you will "be
with us for a few days." If it says
110, they bury you.

key in the hospital never taStes
quite the same as it does at home.
