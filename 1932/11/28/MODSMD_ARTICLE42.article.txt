# Pitt Game Climaxes Discouraging Season for Indians
## CARDS' STRENGTH DIMINISHES AFTER POWERFUL START Indians Won Ten Games On Statistics Sheet, With Only One Loss 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Victorious, defeated, tied—the
Stanford Indian ended the season
with another and all too descriptive
adjective to his sports-name. That
adjective was "beaten," and it was
the Panther of Pittsburgh who gave
headline writers the opportunity to
pin that invective on Pop Warner's
1932 gridiron product for the first
time. Throughout a season of
heightened hopes and deepened de
spair the Indian has never been
outgained or "out-statisticked" —
until the battle of Pittsburgh.
The story of the Stanford Indian,
1932 model, is like the nightmare of
the author who created Frank Mer
riwell. Or it might be entitled "The
Rover Boys on the Run." The Car
dinal eleven was good. It was pow
erful, fast, deceptive. And, of course,
it had virtue on its side. It might
have gone up, or it might have gone
down. As a matter of fact, it went
both up and down, but in reverse-
Merriwell fashion.
Indians Get Bad Breaks
Set the redoubtable Frank forth
on a rampage of the Pacific Coast
looking like a winner, watch him
fight gamely against insurmountable
barriers of tough luck on three suc
cessive pay-day Saturdays, see him
come up to his big test and get
licked—take him to your bosom and
call him your little Stanford Indian.
All of which gets by the rewrite
desk because it implies that the
Warner eleven started strong, ran
into a current of bad breaks, and
then lost to Pittsburgh. So it was.
The wearers of the Winged "O"
came down to the Farm on the 17th
of September looking bigger and
better than ever, and lost—the score,
0 to 0. The next Saturday Pop took
the boys up to Kezar Stadium and
beat a tough little U.S.F. squad 20
to 7.
Mighty Against Oregon State
People began to think of the In
dians in Coast Conference terms.
They noticed the Stanford line—
Doub, Tod, Laborde, Kite, Bates,
Corbus, Grey, Gribben, Colvin. They
tried to follow the ball in the Stan
ford backfiejd—Campbell, Caddel,
Hillman, Lambert, and Afflerbaugh
were the familiar numbers, Maentz
the new. People began to buy Stan- I
ford stock.
On October 1 the Conference sea- j
Rf>n opened for the Indians at Port- |
land, where the Oregon State Beav
ers were "razzle-dazzled" to the
tune of 27-0. The game uncovered !
a new word for radio announcers I
and Bill Sim, who was found to fit \
the breach left by an injury to j
Maentz. Back to the Farm a week '
later, and the Santa Clara Broncos,
conquerors of California, fell before I
the impressive Cardinal, 14 to 0.
Stanford football stock soared higher
and higher.
"The Army looks tough this year,"
said Warner, and next Saturday his
eleven, rather his thirty-three,
whitewashed W.C.A. 2G to 0. Then
out of the South came the under
dog Trojan. He couldn't outgain the
Indian, and he couldn't score more
first downs, but he won, 13 to 0.
"The Trojan jinx," sighed the Farm,
and planned to slaughter the Bruin
of U.C.L.A.
Upset by Bruins
But an unexpectedly vicious
Bruin upset the little Stanford tea
wagon, 13 to 6, not bothering him
self with amassing the yards from
scrimmage which feature the Sun
day morning sports pages. A week
later and the Washington Husky
did the same thing, 18 to 13. The
Indians had*outrushed their oppon
ents like veritable Merriwells on
three successive Saturdays—and
lost.
Came the "breather" with the
California Aggies, and Kenny Afller
baugh and his mates ran wild in
ringing up a 59-0 score. Then the
Big Game. The Indian found him
self in the most favorable of all
heroic positions, that of an under
dog striving to redeem hfmself.
Again Stanford fought—and fought.
It wasn't a loss, but then it wasn't
a victory either. Neither team scored
and Stanford managed to gain the
statistical advantage again.
Pitt Stronger Than Expected
The Cardinal boarded a train foK
Pittsburgh. The Indians nursed their
bruises all the way, and when they
got to Pittsburgh they found it cold.
It Was cold, and the Indians were
tired, and the Panthers were even
better than they were cracked up
to be—and Pittsburgh won, 7-0
ringing down the curtain on the
$1.65 drama called "Frank Merri
well Loses."
It was a tough season, and prob
ably a bitterly disappointing one
from the players' standpoint. Six
victories, four losses, and a tie. But
if the ill-starred heroes of the 1932
Big Red Machine seek consolation,
they need but turn to the ever-in
voked statistics. Only five teams
scored on Stanford, and four of
those teams won. On paper, the
Stanford gridmcn will find that they
won ten games this fall and lost
one, to Pittsburgh.

with another and all too descriptive
adjective to his sports-name. That
adjective was "beaten," and it was
the Panther of Pittsburgh who gave
headline writers the opportunity to
pin that invective on Pop Warner's
1932 gridiron product for the first
time. Throughout a season of
heightened hopes and deepened de
spair the Indian has never been
outgained or "out-statisticked" —
until the battle of Pittsburgh.
The story of the Stanford Indian,
1932 model, is like the nightmare of
the author who created Frank Mer
riwell. Or it might be entitled "The
Rover Boys on the Run." The Car
dinal eleven was good. It was pow
erful, fast, deceptive. And, of course,
it had virtue on its side. It might
have gone up, or it might have gone
down. As a matter of fact, it went
both up and down, but in reverse-
Merriwell fashion.
Indians Get Bad Breaks
Set the redoubtable Frank forth
on a rampage of the Pacific Coast
looking like a winner, watch him
fight gamely against insurmountable
barriers of tough luck on three suc
cessive pay-day Saturdays, see him
come up to his big test and get
licked—take him to your bosom and
call him your little Stanford Indian.
All of which gets by the rewrite
desk because it implies that the
Warner eleven started strong, ran
into a current of bad breaks, and
then lost to Pittsburgh. So it was.
The wearers of the Winged "O"
came down to the Farm on the 17th
of September looking bigger and
better than ever, and lost—the score,
0 to 0. The next Saturday Pop took
the boys up to Kezar Stadium and
beat a tough little U.S.F. squad 20
to 7.
Mighty Against Oregon State
People began to think of the In
dians in Coast Conference terms.
They noticed the Stanford line—
Doub, Tod, Laborde, Kite, Bates,
Corbus, Grey, Gribben, Colvin. They
tried to follow the ball in the Stan
ford backfiejd—Campbell, Caddel,
Hillman, Lambert, and Afflerbaugh
were the familiar numbers, Maentz
the new. People began to buy Stan- I
ford stock.
On October 1 the Conference sea- j
Rf>n opened for the Indians at Port- |
land, where the Oregon State Beav
ers were "razzle-dazzled" to the
tune of 27-0. The game uncovered !
a new word for radio announcers I
and Bill Sim, who was found to fit \
the breach left by an injury to j
Maentz. Back to the Farm a week '
later, and the Santa Clara Broncos,
conquerors of California, fell before I
the impressive Cardinal, 14 to 0.
Stanford football stock soared higher
and higher.
"The Army looks tough this year,"
said Warner, and next Saturday his
eleven, rather his thirty-three,
whitewashed W.C.A. 2G to 0. Then
out of the South came the under
dog Trojan. He couldn't outgain the
Indian, and he couldn't score more
first downs, but he won, 13 to 0.
"The Trojan jinx," sighed the Farm,
and planned to slaughter the Bruin
of U.C.L.A.
Upset by Bruins
But an unexpectedly vicious
Bruin upset the little Stanford tea
wagon, 13 to 6, not bothering him
self with amassing the yards from
scrimmage which feature the Sun
day morning sports pages. A week
later and the Washington Husky
did the same thing, 18 to 13. The
Indians had*outrushed their oppon
ents like veritable Merriwells on
three successive Saturdays—and
lost.
Came the "breather" with the
California Aggies, and Kenny Afller
baugh and his mates ran wild in
ringing up a 59-0 score. Then the
Big Game. The Indian found him
self in the most favorable of all
heroic positions, that of an under
dog striving to redeem hfmself.
Again Stanford fought—and fought.
It wasn't a loss, but then it wasn't
a victory either. Neither team scored
and Stanford managed to gain the
statistical advantage again.
Pitt Stronger Than Expected
The Cardinal boarded a train foK
Pittsburgh. The Indians nursed their
bruises all the way, and when they
got to Pittsburgh they found it cold.
It Was cold, and the Indians were
tired, and the Panthers were even
better than they were cracked up
to be—and Pittsburgh won, 7-0
ringing down the curtain on the
$1.65 drama called "Frank Merri
well Loses."
It was a tough season, and prob
ably a bitterly disappointing one
from the players' standpoint. Six
victories, four losses, and a tie. But
if the ill-starred heroes of the 1932
Big Red Machine seek consolation,
they need but turn to the ever-in
voked statistics. Only five teams
scored on Stanford, and four of
those teams won. On paper, the
Stanford gridmcn will find that they
won ten games this fall and lost
one, to Pittsburgh.

pin that invective on Pop Warner's
1932 gridiron product for the first
time. Throughout a season of
heightened hopes and deepened de
spair the Indian has never been
outgained or "out-statisticked" —
until the battle of Pittsburgh.
The story of the Stanford Indian,
1932 model, is like the nightmare of
the author who created Frank Mer
riwell. Or it might be entitled "The
Rover Boys on the Run." The Car
dinal eleven was good. It was pow
erful, fast, deceptive. And, of course,
it had virtue on its side. It might
have gone up, or it might have gone
down. As a matter of fact, it went
both up and down, but in reverse-
Merriwell fashion.
Indians Get Bad Breaks
Set the redoubtable Frank forth
on a rampage of the Pacific Coast
looking like a winner, watch him
fight gamely against insurmountable
barriers of tough luck on three suc
cessive pay-day Saturdays, see him
come up to his big test and get
licked—take him to your bosom and
call him your little Stanford Indian.
All of which gets by the rewrite
desk because it implies that the
Warner eleven started strong, ran
into a current of bad breaks, and
then lost to Pittsburgh. So it was.
The wearers of the Winged "O"
came down to the Farm on the 17th
of September looking bigger and
better than ever, and lost—the score,
0 to 0. The next Saturday Pop took
the boys up to Kezar Stadium and
beat a tough little U.S.F. squad 20
to 7.
Mighty Against Oregon State
People began to think of the In
dians in Coast Conference terms.
They noticed the Stanford line—
Doub, Tod, Laborde, Kite, Bates,
Corbus, Grey, Gribben, Colvin. They
tried to follow the ball in the Stan
ford backfiejd—Campbell, Caddel,
Hillman, Lambert, and Afflerbaugh
were the familiar numbers, Maentz
the new. People began to buy Stan- I
ford stock.
On October 1 the Conference sea- j
Rf>n opened for the Indians at Port- |
land, where the Oregon State Beav
ers were "razzle-dazzled" to the
tune of 27-0. The game uncovered !
a new word for radio announcers I
and Bill Sim, who was found to fit \
the breach left by an injury to j
Maentz. Back to the Farm a week '
later, and the Santa Clara Broncos,
conquerors of California, fell before I
the impressive Cardinal, 14 to 0.
Stanford football stock soared higher
and higher.
"The Army looks tough this year,"
said Warner, and next Saturday his
eleven, rather his thirty-three,
whitewashed W.C.A. 2G to 0. Then
out of the South came the under
dog Trojan. He couldn't outgain the
Indian, and he couldn't score more
first downs, but he won, 13 to 0.
"The Trojan jinx," sighed the Farm,
Victorious, defeated, tied—the
Stanford Indian ended the season
with another and all too descriptive
adjective to his sports-name. That
adjective was "beaten," and it was
the Panther of Pittsburgh who gave
headline writers the opportunity to
pin that invective on Pop Warner's
1932 gridiron product for the first

Upset by Bruins
But an unexpectedly vicious
Bruin upset the little Stanford tea
wagon, 13 to 6, not bothering him
self with amassing the yards from
scrimmage which feature the Sun
day morning sports pages. A week
later and the Washington Husky
did the same thing, 18 to 13. The
Indians had*outrushed their oppon
ents like veritable Merriwells on
three successive Saturdays—and
lost.
Came the "breather" with the
California Aggies, and Kenny Afller
baugh and his mates ran wild in
ringing up a 59-0 score. Then the
Big Game. The Indian found him
self in the most favorable of all
heroic positions, that of an under
dog striving to redeem hfmself.
Again Stanford fought—and fought.
It wasn't a loss, but then it wasn't
a victory either. Neither team scored
and Stanford managed to gain the
statistical advantage again.
Pitt Stronger Than Expected
The Cardinal boarded a train foK
Pittsburgh. The Indians nursed their
bruises all the way, and when they
got to Pittsburgh they found it cold.
It Was cold, and the Indians were
tired, and the Panthers were even
better than they were cracked up
to be—and Pittsburgh won, 7-0
ringing down the curtain on the
$1.65 drama called "Frank Merri
well Loses."
It was a tough season, and prob
ably a bitterly disappointing one
from the players' standpoint. Six
victories, four losses, and a tie. But
if the ill-starred heroes of the 1932
Big Red Machine seek consolation,
they need but turn to the ever-in
voked statistics. Only five teams
scored on Stanford, and four of
those teams won. On paper, the
Stanford gridmcn will find that they
won ten games this fall and lost
one, to Pittsburgh.
