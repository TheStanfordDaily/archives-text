# Pitt Game Climaxes Discouraging Season for Indians
## CARDS' STRENGTH DIMINISHES AFTER POWERFUL START Indians Won Ten Games On Statistics Sheet, With Only One Loss 
### Fritz Goodwin 
Victorious, defeated, tied—the
Stanford Indian ended the season
with another and all too descriptive
adjective to his sports-name. That
adjective was "beaten," and it was
the Panther of Pittsburgh who gave
headline writers the opportunity to
pin that invective on Pop Warner's
1932 gridiron product for the first
time. Throughout a season of
heightened hopes and deepened de
spair the Indian has never been
outgained or "out-statisticked" —
until the battle of Pittsburgh.
The story of the Stanford Indian,
1932 model, is like the nightmare of
the author who created Frank Mer
riwell. Or it might be entitled "The
Rover Boys on the Run." The Car
dinal eleven was good. It was pow
erful, fast, deceptive. And, of course,
it had virtue on its side. It might
have gone up, or it might have gone
down. As a matter of fact, it went
both up and down, but in reverse-
Merriwell fashion.
Indians Get Bad Breaks
Set the redoubtable Frank forth
on a rampage of the Pacific Coast
looking like a winner, watch him
fight gamely against insurmountable
barriers of tough luck on three suc
cessive pay-day Saturdays, see him
come up to his big test and get
licked—take him to your bosom and
call him your little Stanford Indian.
All of which gets by the rewrite
desk because it implies that the
Warner eleven started strong, ran
into a current of bad breaks, and
then lost to Pittsburgh. So it was.
The wearers of the Winged "O"
came down to the Farm on the 17th
of September looking bigger and
better than ever, and lost—the score,
0 to 0. The next Saturday Pop took
the boys up to Kezar Stadium and
beat a tough little U.S.F. squad 20
to 7.
Mighty Against Oregon State
People began to think of the In
dians in Coast Conference terms.
They noticed the Stanford line—
Doub, Tod, Laborde, Kite, Bates,
Corbus, Grey, Gribben, Colvin. They
tried to follow the ball in the Stan
ford backfiejd—Campbell, Caddel,
Hillman, Lambert, and Afflerbaugh
were the familiar numbers, Maentz
the new. People began to buy Stan- I
ford stock.
On October 1 the Conference sea- j
Rf>n opened for the Indians at Port- |
land, where the Oregon State Beav
ers were "razzle-dazzled" to the
tune of 27-0. The game uncovered !
a new word for radio announcers I
and Bill Sim, who was found to fit \
the breach left by an injury to j
Maentz. Back to the Farm a week '
later, and the Santa Clara Broncos,
conquerors of California, fell before I
the impressive Cardinal, 14 to 0.
Stanford football stock soared higher
and higher.
"The Army looks tough this year,"
said Warner, and next Saturday his
eleven, rather his thirty-three,
whitewashed W.C.A. 2G to 0. Then
out of the South came the under
dog Trojan. He couldn't outgain the
Indian, and he couldn't score more
first downs, but he won, 13 to 0.
"The Trojan jinx," sighed the Farm,
