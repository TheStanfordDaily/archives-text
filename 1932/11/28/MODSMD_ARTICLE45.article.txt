U.C.L.A. RRUINS, for the fine
record that they have hung up
this season, it was sort of a re
lief to have a conference team
take them into camp for a
change.
The Bruins are a tough outfit, and
play good defensive football,
but 'no one would be tempted to
hold them up in the public eye as
the last word in scoring power.
Furthermore, it just naturally
wouldn't be right lo compare their
strength with that of an eleven like
the present edition of Head Man
Jones' Thundering Herd. They can
take 'em, but they can't give 'em.

NOW THAT FOOTBALL SCHED
ULES are almost washed up all
over the country, and the beaten
teams are packing away the old
moleskins and "waiting till next
year," the boys who haven't been
upset are commencing to cast hun
gry looks at the Rose Bowl.
From Michigan comes the in
formation that Rig Ten officials
will probably be only too will
ing to waive their rule against
post-season contests for mem
bers, in the hope that Michigan
will be able to make some money
out of the classic on New Year's
Day.
While from Colgate some care
less gent has sent out word that
the Red Raiders "will be glad
to consider an invitation to meet
some western team in the Pasa
dena battle."
Personally, we aren't awfully ex
cited about who plays what in the
Rose Bowl, but for the benefit of
those who lay their hard-earned
dollars on the line it might be well
to mention a few things.
Colgate, we are told, beat Brown
with single and double reverses,
spinners, forwards and laterals, fake
reverses and double passes. Well, as
nearly as we can remember this
was accomplished after the first
Half, in which Brown played itself
out holding a couple of Colgate
teams.
/t <t>
If Colgate came out here, it
would find the tables not only
turned, but magnified. Troy can
put three or four teams on the

! field in rapid succession. Fur
thermore, have you any idea
about how much the reverses,
spinners, and fake this and thats
will fool the Trojans?
<$> <& <sÂ»
Now the rest of this is just sup
position, but we have a sneaking
suspicion that Michigan would send
> cut a bigger team, a team that
; boasts in Harry Newman some real,
honest-to-gosh All-American ma
j terial, and a team that would be
plenty tough.
Newman is a sweet quarterback,
and has been responsible for an
; average of better than ten points a
game throughout the past season
1 either through his passing, kicking,
' or ball-carrying. In addition he is
the captain of a champion of a tough
I conference, one in , which
game is an historic grudge battle.
I So if you have anything to say
| about which one comes West, look
! them over pretty carefully.
