# FOUR GRID TEAMS MAINTAIN PERFECT SECTIONAL RATING
## Colgate, Auburn, Michigan, Trojans Still Untied And Undefeated

One team in each section of the
country remained undefeated and
untied at the conclusion of the last
week of the regular national football
schedulq, producing for the first
time in many years an ideal grid
situation from the national stand
point.
Colgate in the East, Auburn in the
South, Michigan in the Midwest, and
Southern California on the Pacific
Coast, maintained perfect records,
but Pittsburgh's eleven, twice tied,
made a bid for recognition with a
7-0 v'ctory over Stanford.
Colgate Unscored On
Andy Kerr's Colgate Red Raiders
pounded out a 21-0 win over Brown
in their annual Thanksgiving Day
classic, thus finishing their nine
game schedule undefeated, untied,
and unscored on. Colgate's Warner
system attack did not function,
however, until Brown's "Iron Men"
had tired badly in the second half,
but were forced to remain in the
game because of a lack of satisfac
tory replacements.
Michigan and Alabama Poly
(Auburn) played no games over the
vacation, but U.S.C. won its last
conference game of the year from
Washington, 9-G. A field goal (by
Cal Clemens) proved the winning
margin, just as W.S.C.'s last
second 3-0 victory over U.C.L.A.
The Trojans were not quite as im
pressive as in earlier games, but the
absence of Ail-American Ernie
Smith may to a large measure ac
j count for this reversal of form.
Auburn Plays Saturday
Auburn still must play South
Carolina on December 3 before it
can claim the Southern Conference
title, but victory in this game ap
! pears certain. Louisiana State, the
only other undefeated and untied
i team in conference competition,
closed its season with an impressive
14-0 victory over Tulane. Louisiana
State has been beaten by Rice In
stitute and Centenary College in
non-conference games, and tied by
Texas Christian.
The Southwest Conference cham
pionship race closed with Texas
■ Christian in first place, Texas Uni
! versity in second, and Rice Institute
| in third. The final games of the sea
son gave T.C.U. an 8-0 victory over'
Southern Methodist, Rice a 12-0
triumph over Baylor, and Texas a
, 21-0 win over Texas Aggies.
Irish Win
Notre Dame swamped the Army,
[ 21-0, New York beat Carnegie Tech,
| and Pennsylvania nosed out Cornell
in important Eastern games.
Brown was not the only unde-
I feated and untied team to lose its
| enviable standing. Centenary Col*-
i lege of Shreveport, Louisiana —
boasting the most impressive record
' of any small college in the country,
j was held to a scoreless tie by the
| University of Arkansas.
