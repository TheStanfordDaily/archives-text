# "GHOSTS" TO BE READ THURSDAY
## Sword And Sandals Offers Stormy Ibsen Play 
### Jim Sandoe 
Hendrik Ibsen's "Ghosts," which,
when produced late in the last cen
tury, aroused a storm of protest and
applause, has been selected as the
second Sword and Sandals reading
for this quarter. It Will be read
Thursday evening in the Little The
ater.
The central character of the drama
is Mrs. Alving, a woman torn be
tween the right and a false notion
of what is right; a woman bound
by the insidious conventious against
which Ibsen contested throughout
his life and so many of his plays.
Dr. Margery Bailey, who appeared
last year in the "Silver Cord" and
"Romeo and Juliet," is to read this
role, something of a tour de force
used frequently by actresses since
the play's first production.
"Ghosts" was last revived in the
West by Mrs. Patrick Campbell, who
produced it in San Francisco for two
weeks in 1930. Tom Douglas was
seen in the important role of Oswald
Alving. The reader for this part has
not as yet been selected. The final
cast will be announced soon.
As usual, the reading will begin
at 7:30 o'clock, at which time the
doors will be closed to late comers.
