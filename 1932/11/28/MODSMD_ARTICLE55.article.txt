SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27 (£*)—
While walking in Vistacion Valley,,
George Esthimakis, 35, of 915 Athens
street, was struck in the hip yester- |
day by a stray bullet. It was thought j
by police that the bullet was fired |
by boys during target practice.

After a certain speed is attained
by an airplane in a power dive,!
the propeller acts as a brake.
