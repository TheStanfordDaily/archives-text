I the Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer com
! pany, asking that a team of Stan
ford debaters should prepare to ar
gue upon some question concerning
Russia, such as capitalism versus
communism. If the debate proves

Trojans to Oppose Cards
It is understood that University
! of Southern California debaters will
! be invited to oppose the Cardinals
!in the contest. The company has
promised that a celebrated movie
star shall be chosen to preside over
the debate. Members of the movie
colony will compose the audience.
Coach Chapin has tentatively afc-
I cepted the proposal, subject to the
| approval of Professor Lee Emerson
J Basset, head of the public speaking
j department. The matter will come
| before the debate council this after-
I noon for formal approval.
JofTre Squad Material
The participants are likely to be
j chosen from the Joffre squad, which
| contains such foremost contenders
j as Mary-Katherine Morris, who has
I placed twice in Joffre debates and is
[president of the Associated Women
.Students, Joseph Wolf, well-known
| actor and debater of the campus,
! and Wayne Bannister, veteran de
! bater and recent president of the
j campus Hoover Club. Another pos
. sibility is Nicol Smith, who is not so
experienced, but who was on the
I Joffre squad two years ago, has
| traveled widely, and has lectured
! on Russia at many places about the
i state.
The debaters will have at their
i disposal the results of research on
j the actual conditions in Russia
j which has cost the M-G-M people
nearly $200,000.

| made to the Stanford debate squad.

year with Harvard University,
! broadcast from coast to coast over
