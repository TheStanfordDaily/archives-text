# REPEAL BILL TO TEST WET FORCE IN VOTE MONDAY
## Garner Drafts New Form Of Resolution Flayed By Congressmen 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (/P)â€”A
threatened bolt by groups in bolh
parties may put the potency of
House wet strength to a rigorous
test next Monday in the vote
planned then on the Democratic
outright prohibition repeal pro
posal.
Designed to conform to the Demo
cratic platform, it would amend the
constitution to read:
"The eighteenth article of amend
ment is hereby repealed.
Seven Years to Ratify
"This article shall be inoperative
unless it shall have been ratified as
an amendment to the constitution
by conventions in three-fourths of
the several States within seven
years from the date of its submis
sion to the States by the Congress."
Grumblings were heard in various
quarters today on Capitol Hill over
the form of the resolution made
public by its sponsor, Speaker Gar
ner, calling for flat repeal and rati
fication through State conventions.
Prefer Glass Measure
Several Southern Democrats said
they preferred to vote on a resolu
tion similar to the Glass amendment
in the Senate, providing for out
lawing the saloon and Federal pro
tection to dry States.
Senator Norris (R., Neb.), chair
man of the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee, said he was opposed to the
Vice-President-elect's proposal, but
favored modification of the Volstead
act. He said he was ready to vote
o nrepeal but did not think it would
pass at this session.
Garner Undisturbed
Apparently undisturbed by op
posing views, Speaker Garner went
forward with his plans to force a
vote Monday on his proposal,
drafted on the basis of the Demo
cratic platform. He submitted it to
Chairman Sumners of the House
Judiciary Committee.
Sumners, a fellow Texan, imme
diately voiced disapproval of the
State convention provision. The
Legislatures, he said, could act more
expeditiously, although the Con
gress had authority to set up the
entire machinery for State conven
tions to act on a Federal matter.
