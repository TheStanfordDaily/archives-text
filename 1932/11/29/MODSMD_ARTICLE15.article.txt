# Deny Library Sex Tests Menace Student Morals

### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Stanford students' morals are not
endangered by reading frank or
risque books.
Such is the opinion of the Library
authorities. No book is forbidden or
segregated because of its contents.
An educational institution requires
a few overly outspoken books of the
type which a public library excludes
from its collection. These books
cannot be left openly on the shelves,
according to Director of Libraries
Nathan Van Patten, although "we
are not book censors. All the books
are for use. But we know something
is wrong when 50 or HO people a
week want to read Casanova."
" Volumes such as Burton's "Ara
bian Nights'' and Havelock Ellis'
"Psychology of Sex'' are necessities
for some courses. Some hundreds
of these so-called "ofT-color" books
are kept in a special bookcase, and
are loaned to any student who asks
for them.
The purpose of the segregation is

two-fold. If these books were in the
stacks, they would likely be stolen
by students who are ashamed to
sign for them. Also, aside from
moral purposes, the library authori
ties think it best not to encourage
engineering students, for example,
to waste their time reading the 25
volumes in the set of Casanova's
Memoirs.
Director Van Patten explained,
"The librarians don't select most of
the new books—the teaching staff
does. If a professor decides a certain
volume is accessary for his class,
we buy it for the library. And we
consider any book in the library is
for the use of the students."
Rare, valuable, and finely-printed
books may be read only in the li-
I brary; a few books on sexual psych
ology are on permanent reserve by
! order of the Psychology Depart
ment; books sold only for medical
use are beyond the discretion of the
librarians.
