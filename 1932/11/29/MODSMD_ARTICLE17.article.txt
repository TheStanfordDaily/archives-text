### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (/P) â€”
Holding to the position that Europe
has failed to produce facts which
justify her requests for postpone
ment of war debt payments due
next month, President Hoover and
his advisors tonight awaited the ar
rival of additional notes from Lon
don and Paris.
Secretary Mills and Secretary
Stimson talked the situation over
with the Chief Executive today and
afterward said no new decisions had
been reached and America's course
remained unaltered.
"We will know more in 48 hours,"
Mills said in reply to newspaper
men's questions on what the debtor
nations will do on December 15
when the next installments fall due.
"Right now we are standing square
ly on the President's position that
no facts have been presented to
warrant suspension of the Decem
ber 15 payments, and that these
payments should be made."
