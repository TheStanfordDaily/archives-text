## Relief Fund Gets Proceeds Of Annual Event In Pavilion 
### Collier Connell 
With the Carnival four nights
away, plans for the slinging of all
campus money are heading toward
a climax. A consignment of 400
goldfish arrived last night, first of
an advance guard destined to aid
the Student Relief Fund by drain
ing dimes and more dimes out of
Saturday night's collegiate Carnival
going pockets.
At a reed-fringed pool in the Pa
vilion, the goldfish, said to be of
excellent fighting spirit, will dodge
the seines of hilarious Waltons un
til they are caught and taken off to
a new abode in the Toyon and
Branner washbasins.
Non-profitable concessions of for
mer Carnivals have been thrown
overboard, with unique and irre
sistible replacements, according to
the student committee of the '"500,"
experts in Carnival designing.
While the import of a chuek-a
luck table from Reno, Nevada, was
still under way this morning, a score
of other games of skill and chance
are moving into construction in the
Pavilion, where booths are ready to
be carpentered into solid ranks
along the walls.
Absolutely no resemblance to its
other uses as Concert Series audi
torium, basketball battleground, or
rally-hall, is promised the Pavilior)
for Saturday .night, when the women
have completed its disguise as
Scene-of-Carnival-Night.
All up and down the Row and at
Roble, hammers, paintbrushes, buck
ets of excited fish, pots of paint,
gigantic stores of foodstuffs, rains of
serpentine, and splashy murals un
der construction, furnish pre-Carni
val flavor, with substantial promise
of Saturday night's success.
What the Masque Ball is to spring
quarter, ah pleasant memories, the
Carnival is to the autumn. Major
significance is given this year's
Carnival by its ambitious goal of
$1000 proceeds, to be redistributed
about the campus where it is most
bitterly needed, through the super
vision of a Student Relief Commit
tee.
This fifth all-University Carnival
is unique in facing an almost-emer
gency need, that has rarely digni
fied campus Carnivals before.

$1000 proceeds, to be redistributed
about the campus where it is most
bitterly needed, through the super
vision of a Student Relief Commit
tee.
This fifth all-University Carnival
is unique in facing an almost-emer
gency need, that has rarely digni
fied campus Carnivals before.
With the Carnival four nights
away, plans for the slinging of all
campus money are heading toward
a climax. A consignment of 400
goldfish arrived last night, first of
an advance guard destined to aid
the Student Relief Fund by drain
ing dimes and more dimes out of
Saturday night's collegiate Carnival
going pockets.
At a reed-fringed pool in the Pa
vilion, the goldfish, said to be of
excellent fighting spirit, will dodge
the seines of hilarious Waltons un
til they are caught and taken off to
a new abode in the Toyon and
Branner washbasins.
Non-profitable concessions of for
mer Carnivals have been thrown
overboard, with unique and irre
sistible replacements, according to
the student committee of the '"500,"
experts in Carnival designing.
While the import of a chuek-a
luck table from Reno, Nevada, was
still under way this morning, a score
of other games of skill and chance
are moving into construction in the
Pavilion, where booths are ready to
be carpentered into solid ranks
along the walls.
Absolutely no resemblance to its
other uses as Concert Series audi
torium, basketball battleground, or
rally-hall, is promised the Pavilior)
for Saturday .night, when the women
have completed its disguise as
Scene-of-Carnival-Night.
All up and down the Row and at
Roble, hammers, paintbrushes, buck
ets of excited fish, pots of paint,
gigantic stores of foodstuffs, rains of
serpentine, and splashy murals un
der construction, furnish pre-Carni
val flavor, with substantial promise
of Saturday night's success.
What the Masque Ball is to spring
quarter, ah pleasant memories, the
Carnival is to the autumn. Major
significance is given this year's
Carnival by its ambitious goal of
$1000 proceeds, to be redistributed
about the campus where it is most
bitterly needed, through the super
vision of a Student Relief Commit
tee.
This fifth all-University Carnival
is unique in facing an almost-emer
gency need, that has rarely digni
