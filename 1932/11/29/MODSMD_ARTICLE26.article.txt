# CAMPUS URGED TO BUY SEALS
## Aynesworth Says Profits Go To Rest Homes 
### 
Because off-campus students are
difficult to contact and consequently
are seldom asked to contribute to
campus charity funds, a special ap
peal for their support in the Tuber
cular Christmas Seal Drive dui'ing
the next two weeks was voiced to
day by Anna Louise Aynesworth,
campaign leader.
"It is hoped that these students
will be able to buy at least 25 of
the seals, which sell at a penny each.
As not all purses may permit this
purchase or a larger one, seals may
also be bought in smaller amounts,"
Miss Aynesworth stated.
Sale in Women's Clubhouse
Seals may be obtained from Mrs.
David Lamson, Y.W.C.A. secretary,
or from room hostesses on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
Yesterday afternoon Eunice Force,
manager of the drive on the Row,
called a meeting of representatives
which she has appointed from each
house. She announced that each sor
ority will be asked to give a mini
mum of $2.50.
