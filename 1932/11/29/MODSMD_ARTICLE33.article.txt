# A 						PACKED PAVILION, AND VINDICATION

When some public-spirited soul takes il upon liimself
to preach lo the common people the desirability of seek
ing out entertainment of the "cultural" variety like con
certs, for example, instead of movies, or dog races, and his
pleas fall upon unheeding ears, he will invariably bemoan
the lack of appreciation in the rank and file and offer up
a praver for its deliverance, "for they know not what they
do," etc.
We're not calling the "upper one half of one per cent"
that goes to make up the student body of Stanford the
"rank and tile," understand, but nevertheless the fore
going applies lo the concert series here, and to those who
have talked it up as an enterprise that students oiifjhl to
support if they are to become the finished cultured prod
ucts that a high-class university attempts to turn out.
II seems never to occur to these cxhorters and be
moaners that something else might be wrong, and that
maybe the student body is not, after all, so unappreciative
of liner things, so uncouth, if you will. That last show, for
example, which left the concert series in a horrible finan
cial hole right at the start. Perhaps this particular concert
was not the type that could appeal to college men and
women. Or, even if il was, perhaps college men and
women cannot afford two dollars, a buck fifty, or even one
iron man for a single evening of entertainment that is
good, but not uproariously excellent.
Our guess is that the answer to Stanford's "lack of
cultural appreciation" may be found in one of these fac
tors, or in a combination of both.
Hence it is that the Daily is happy to see the Hall
.Johnson Negro (.bonis go on the concert series boards to
night. Surely these singing sons of Africa will pack the
Pavilion, and by so doing prove that Stanford is not losing
its capacity to appreciate good concerts.
For these dusky crooners put on a show that is an
unroariouslv excellent one, worth several times over the
one, one lift v, or two.
