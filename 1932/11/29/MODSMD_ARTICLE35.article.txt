# WHERE IS THAT CHECK?

### 
The Carnegie Report lias gone the way of all statistics.
The ripples which these accusations stirred up have disap
peared. (College professionalism is still the topic for rainv
(lavs, hut the facts on this evil are noticeable by their
scarcity. However, through the power of some super
natural medium, a gentleman iu the north accused Stan
ford of giving her athletes a $(>() pay check each month.
These checks, it was alleged, came straight from the Ad
ministration Ruilding. The gentleman is optimistic!
In a letter to a San Francisco newspaper, the mother of
a Stanford player (name unknown), after having read the
diatribe of tmr Oregon friend, expresses the wish that her
son be paid! Her story, which is typical of many which
are not put down in writing, would indicate that the Stan
ford Administration does not issue checks to football
players. The letter, on the other hand, graphically portrays
the hardships which a man must go through who wishes to
play football at the same time that he is earning his wax
in college.
The above expression of opinion combined with the
sentiments of past football stars would tend to show that,
far from getting any profit from college football playing,
the player has little but memories of past glories to provide
his "Ihree-a-day" in the cold, cold world.
The Daii y advises a strong helping of salt to be taken
with any seemingly tasty dish on professionalism in col
leges which a publicity starved editor may offer.

Yes, we meet again todav; surelv none will stav awav
