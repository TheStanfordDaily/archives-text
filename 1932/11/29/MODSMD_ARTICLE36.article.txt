When the movie colony acts, it's j
bad enough. Everyone knows that. !
But when they stop acting and be
gin philosophizing, then we realize
how well off we were when they
were acting. I just learned that.
Marie Dressier is the most recent to j
step from her swank New York
apartment to give the great radio j
audience a choice bit of advice on
how to play this old game of Life—
with a capital "L."
Because show people are broke i
such a great percentage of the time,
they seem to be especially qualified j
to render a life's philosophy when j
they have once crashed the upper j
brackets of the income tax schedule, i
Dressler's idea is that somehow the !
depression isn't the disaster we all '
thought it was. With her salary, I '■
wouldn't think it so bad either. No.
prosperity is the germ—the evil J
virus that must be guarded against. |
Once we realize how really awful
prosperity is, then of course de
pression seems pretty swell. In fact,
if Dressier had had enough time or j
the air, she would no doubt have |
had the unemployed singing spring J
ballads, the farmers gurgling in;
paroxysms of joy, and everyone j
generally delirious with happiness, j
And maybe she did before she !
ended. I dialed her off in the middle. |

The only ihing to say for this tal
ented actress is that many industrial
tycoons and business potentates

have attempted the same sort of
guff—talking the depression away.
The Rotary solution to all problems
—slap on the back, smile on the face,
spring in the step, and song on the
lips, is of course impotent and hope
lessly sterile.

Why not admit what we all know
to be true? The depression is here.
It is devastating to many and an
noying to all. Prosperity was great.
The sooner we recapture it, or a
very close relative, the better it will
be. That's what everyone believes.
.And the concerted desire of many
to keep the depression under cover,
hushed up, and unrecognized, is re
pression of the worst sort.

The depression is to us what Cy
rano's titanic schnozzle was to him—
a direct slap in the face. He may
have prohibited others from talking
about it—but he was the last per
son in the world to deny its Gargan
tuan proportions. But the depres
sion is a horrific beagle rigged up
on each of us —a hulking deformity
in the middle of our economic pans.

We have one advantage, over
Cyrano—by discussing and talking
about the depression we may per
form the necessary operation to
make us once more economic Gables
and Garbos. And this Dressier pala
ver about prosperity being a germ
. . . how everybody would like to
contract a severe case of prosperi
titus. —Abe Mellinkoff

. . . how everybody would like to
contract a severe case of prosperi
titus. —Abe Mellinkoff
When the movie colony acts, it's j
bad enough. Everyone knows that. !
But when they stop acting and be
gin philosophizing, then we realize
how well off we were when they
were acting. I just learned that.
Marie Dressier is the most recent to j
step from her swank New York
apartment to give the great radio j
audience a choice bit of advice on
how to play this old game of Life—
with a capital "L."
Because show people are broke i
such a great percentage of the time,
they seem to be especially qualified j
to render a life's philosophy when j
they have once crashed the upper j
brackets of the income tax schedule, i
Dressler's idea is that somehow the !
depression isn't the disaster we all '
thought it was. With her salary, I '■
wouldn't think it so bad either. No.
prosperity is the germ—the evil J
virus that must be guarded against. |
Once we realize how really awful
prosperity is, then of course de
pression seems pretty swell. In fact,
if Dressier had had enough time or j
the air, she would no doubt have |
had the unemployed singing spring J
ballads, the farmers gurgling in;
paroxysms of joy, and everyone j
generally delirious with happiness, j
And maybe she did before she !
ended. I dialed her off in the middle. |

The only ihing to say for this tal
ented actress is that many industrial
tycoons and business potentates

have attempted the same sort of
guff—talking the depression away.
The Rotary solution to all problems
—slap on the back, smile on the face,
spring in the step, and song on the
lips, is of course impotent and hope
lessly sterile.

Why not admit what we all know
to be true? The depression is here.
It is devastating to many and an
noying to all. Prosperity was great.
The sooner we recapture it, or a
very close relative, the better it will
be. That's what everyone believes.
.And the concerted desire of many
to keep the depression under cover,
hushed up, and unrecognized, is re
pression of the worst sort.

The depression is to us what Cy
rano's titanic schnozzle was to him—
a direct slap in the face. He may
have prohibited others from talking
about it—but he was the last per
son in the world to deny its Gargan
tuan proportions. But the depres
sion is a horrific beagle rigged up
on each of us —a hulking deformity
in the middle of our economic pans.

We have one advantage, over
Cyrano—by discussing and talking
about the depression we may per
form the necessary operation to
make us once more economic Gables
and Garbos. And this Dressier pala
ver about prosperity being a germ
