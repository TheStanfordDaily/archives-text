THE HALL JOHNSON NEGRO
CHOIR — (At the War Memorial
Opera House.)
Last Tuesday night and again on
Sunday afternoon some three thou
sand people applauded the Hall
Johnson Negro Choir to encore after
encore. The crowd was swept by
waves of spontaneous enthusiasm,
and apparently could not get enough
of the remarkable singing. These
colored choristers sang several
groups of negro spirituals and other
racial songs with genuine fervor
and feeling, and with a quality of
tone astonishingly orchestral in ef
fect. They scored a tremendous and
well-deserved success.

The choir has been enlarged from
the original sixteen voices to twenty
voices, twelve men and eight
women. The balance of the choir
is most admirable and the vocal
qualities exceptionally fine. How
ever, beyond an adequate clarity of
diction and a fair precision of at
tack, no attempt is made to secure
a perfect choral ensemble as gen
erally accepted. By doing this the
choir is able to preserve in the songs
the very distinctive negro harmonies
and the emotional content that
would be lost by a greater refine
ment of method.

This negro chorus is (he group
which contributed so great a part
to the outstanding success of the
New York production of "The Green
Pastures." The choir in each of its
concerts includes several of the
numbers which were used in "The
Green Pastures." In addition to,
these numbers, the audience was
particularly pleased with "Ezekiel
Saw De Wheel," "01' Black Joe,"
"Water Boy," "St. James Infirmary
Blues," "St. Louis Blues," "Scan
dalize My Name," and "Go Down
Moses." It was one of the most en
joyable programs we have heard
for a long, long time. —E.M.

picture: it may be pointed out with j
veracity that the plot is nonsensi- i
cal, that the pathos, the gallant !
sentimentality is equally silly, that j
the romance and symbolism are j
merely old devices for the amuse- i
ment of the feeble-minded.
But that will not explain why, in
combination, these unpromising ele- '
ments make so pleasant a film, i
Trivial as it is, it has been given j
most careful direction and is acted I
discreetly for romance and not too
much pathos by Kay Francis and !
William Powell.
Perhaps the comedy is the ex
planation of its paradoxical virtues. i
In tone with the romantic qualities j
of the situation and seldom droop- !

ing into pity for the pathos of the
plot, it aids in lifting the film from
any over-sentimentality which the
excellent and wisely directed play
ing may have left.
To Aline MacMahon and Frank
Mac Hugh fall the greatest share of
the straight comedy. Miss MacMahon
is excellent in her frank, pointed
manner, and Mac Hugh, who has
been playing the same cinema drunk
for some three years, has a better
chance and more gags than he has
hitherto.
For the romantic rather than the
cooly critical this picture should be
enjoyable, however slight.
The tempo of the accompanying
Chaplin comedy, made in 1918 and
only now revived, is amazingly
rapid; a swinging door used to great
length is an excellent example of
the comedy of repetition. It is a rue
ful reflection upon the best of the
current comedy shorts. —Sandoe

This third-rate show has nothing
to recommend. Janet Gaynor is too
obviously bored with her role as a
sea captain's daughter who likes her
pet monkey better than most any
man—except of course Charles Far
rell, who, according to the program
advertisement is the perfect lover—
to save the picture. Gaynor can
hardly help instilling a little viva
city and charm into the character
of Tess. She chases Prof. Peppy, her
monkey, up and down the ship's
rigging and throws potatoes at the
hero in a charming manner. But that
is the best that can be said for her
otherwise insipid role.
The story is laid in a small fishing
town where Tess's father has be
come a reluctant landlubber in order
to keep his daughter from the sea
and its various seductions, Fred
erick (Charles Farrell), the son of
a rich misanthrope who has caused
the skipper much trouble, falls in
love with Tess. But when he finds

thorized child he hastily consults

Opera House.)
Last Tuesday night and again on
Sunday afternoon some three thou
sand people applauded the Hall
Johnson Negro Choir to encore after
encore. The crowd was swept by
waves of spontaneous enthusiasm,
and apparently could not get enough
of the remarkable singing. These
colored choristers sang several
groups of negro spirituals and other
racial songs with genuine fervor
and feeling, and with a quality of
tone astonishingly orchestral in ef
fect. They scored a tremendous and
well-deserved success.

The choir has been enlarged from
the original sixteen voices to twenty
voices, twelve men and eight
women. The balance of the choir
is most admirable and the vocal
qualities exceptionally fine. How
ever, beyond an adequate clarity of
diction and a fair precision of at
tack, no attempt is made to secure
a perfect choral ensemble as gen
erally accepted. By doing this the
choir is able to preserve in the songs
the very distinctive negro harmonies
and the emotional content that
would be lost by a greater refine
ment of method.

This negro chorus is (he group
which contributed so great a part
to the outstanding success of the
New York production of "The Green
Pastures." The choir in each of its
concerts includes several of the
numbers which were used in "The
Green Pastures." In addition to,
these numbers, the audience was
particularly pleased with "Ezekiel
Saw De Wheel," "01' Black Joe,"
"Water Boy," "St. James Infirmary
Blues," "St. Louis Blues," "Scan
dalize My Name," and "Go Down
Moses." It was one of the most en
joyable programs we have heard
for a long, long time. —E.M.

picture: it may be pointed out with j
veracity that the plot is nonsensi- i
cal, that the pathos, the gallant !
sentimentality is equally silly, that j
the romance and symbolism are j
merely old devices for the amuse- i
ment of the feeble-minded.
But that will not explain why, in
combination, these unpromising ele- '
ments make so pleasant a film, i
Trivial as it is, it has been given j
most careful direction and is acted I
discreetly for romance and not too
much pathos by Kay Francis and !
William Powell.
Perhaps the comedy is the ex
planation of its paradoxical virtues. i
In tone with the romantic qualities j
of the situation and seldom droop- !

ing into pity for the pathos of the
plot, it aids in lifting the film from
any over-sentimentality which the
excellent and wisely directed play
ing may have left.
To Aline MacMahon and Frank
Mac Hugh fall the greatest share of
the straight comedy. Miss MacMahon
is excellent in her frank, pointed
manner, and Mac Hugh, who has
been playing the same cinema drunk
for some three years, has a better
chance and more gags than he has
hitherto.
For the romantic rather than the
cooly critical this picture should be
enjoyable, however slight.
The tempo of the accompanying
Chaplin comedy, made in 1918 and
only now revived, is amazingly
rapid; a swinging door used to great
length is an excellent example of
the comedy of repetition. It is a rue
ful reflection upon the best of the
current comedy shorts. —Sandoe

TESS OF TIIE STORM COUNTRY

This third-rate show has nothing
to recommend. Janet Gaynor is too
obviously bored with her role as a
sea captain's daughter who likes her
pet monkey better than most any
man—except of course Charles Far
rell, who, according to the program
advertisement is the perfect lover—
to save the picture. Gaynor can
hardly help instilling a little viva
city and charm into the character
of Tess. She chases Prof. Peppy, her
monkey, up and down the ship's
rigging and throws potatoes at the
hero in a charming manner. But that
is the best that can be said for her
otherwise insipid role.
The story is laid in a small fishing
town where Tess's father has be
come a reluctant landlubber in order
to keep his daughter from the sea
and its various seductions, Fred
erick (Charles Farrell), the son of
a rich misanthrope who has caused
the skipper much trouble, falls in

thorized child he hastily consults

Sunday afternoon some three thou
sand people applauded the Hall
Johnson Negro Choir to encore after
encore. The crowd was swept by
waves of spontaneous enthusiasm,
and apparently could not get enough
of the remarkable singing. These
colored choristers sang several
groups of negro spirituals and other
racial songs with genuine fervor
and feeling, and with a quality of
tone astonishingly orchestral in ef
fect. They scored a tremendous and
well-deserved success.

The choir has been enlarged from
the original sixteen voices to twenty
voices, twelve men and eight
women. The balance of the choir
is most admirable and the vocal
qualities exceptionally fine. How
ever, beyond an adequate clarity of
diction and a fair precision of at
tack, no attempt is made to secure
a perfect choral ensemble as gen
erally accepted. By doing this the
choir is able to preserve in the songs
the very distinctive negro harmonies
and the emotional content that
would be lost by a greater refine
ment of method.

This negro chorus is (he group
which contributed so great a part
to the outstanding success of the
New York production of "The Green
Pastures." The choir in each of its
concerts includes several of the
numbers which were used in "The
Green Pastures." In addition to,
these numbers, the audience was
particularly pleased with "Ezekiel
Saw De Wheel," "01' Black Joe,"
"Water Boy," "St. James Infirmary
Blues," "St. Louis Blues," "Scan
dalize My Name," and "Go Down
Moses." It was one of the most en
joyable programs we have heard
for a long, long time. —E.M.

the straight comedy. Miss MacMahon
is excellent in her frank, pointed
manner, and Mac Hugh, who has

hitherto.

cooly critical this picture should be
enjoyable, however slight.
The tempo of the accompanying

current comedy shorts. —Sandoe

This third-rate show has nothing
to recommend. Janet Gaynor is too
obviously bored with her role as a
sea captain's daughter who likes her
pet monkey better than most any
man—except of course Charles Far
rell, who, according to the program
advertisement is the perfect lover—
to save the picture. Gaynor can
hardly help instilling a little viva
city and charm into the character
of Tess. She chases Prof. Peppy, her
monkey, up and down the ship's
rigging and throws potatoes at the
hero in a charming manner. But that
is the best that can be said for her
otherwise insipid role.
The story is laid in a small fishing
town where Tess's father has be
come a reluctant landlubber in order
to keep his daughter from the sea
and its various seductions, Fred
erick (Charles Farrell), the son of
a rich misanthrope who has caused
the skipper much trouble, falls in
