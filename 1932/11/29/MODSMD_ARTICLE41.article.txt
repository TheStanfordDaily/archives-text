The Editor, Sir: /
Tonight, the Hall Johnson Negro
Choir presents a concert to the cam
pus. This choii; is the one that ap
peared in "Green Pastures'' during
its sensational Broadway run.
Whether "Green Pastures" was
made famous by the Johnson sing
ers or whether the reverse is true,
is of little importance. Suffice it to
say, that the Johnson choir ended
with a great reputation, which
reputation has been sustained by
later work.
The students can enjoy this con
cert tonight and pay for it by buy
ing tickets. If they do not wish to
pay for it this way, they can stay
away and pay the deficit from stu
dent body funds.
The students pay either way. Why
not enjoy while we pay?
