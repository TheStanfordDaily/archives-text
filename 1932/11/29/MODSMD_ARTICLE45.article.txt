NEW YORK, Nov. 28
spite added safeguards in the rules,
death again took heavy toll of foot
ball players in the United States
and territories during the season
now dragging to a close, records to
day showing thirty-seven succumbed
to injuries.
With most high-school schedules
completed, the death total for the
year probably will fall below the
record number of fifty fatally in
jured in 1032, but the present figure
is tlie second greatest for any year
since national records were kept.
Up to 1931, the largest number was
Iwenty in 1925.
