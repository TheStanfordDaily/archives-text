WE ARE JUST BOUND AND determined to give you one
more helping of Rose Bowl hash, and then we'll try to think up
something better.
Auburn, or Alabama Polytechnic, has beaten Birmingham Southern,
Erskine, Duke, Georgia Tech, Tulane, Mississippi, Howard, Florida, and
Georgia so far, with only a Carolina to go.
Colgate has numbered St. Lawrence, Case, Niagara. Lafayette,
New York University, Penn State, Mississippi College, Syracuse,
and Brown among its victims.
Michigan has trounced Michigan Slate, Northwestern, Ohio State,
Illinois, Princeton, Indiana, Chicago, and Minnesota.
Pittsburgh bases its claim to fame on a schedule which numbered
Ohio Northern, West Virginia, Duquesne, Army, Ohio State, Notre Dame,
Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Carnegie Tech, and Stanford.
Auburn went through its schedule with 255 points scored and
.*54 allowed. The team is characterized by Wallace Wade of Duke
as one of the best in the South. Its best feature is its lack of a
weakness. It is evenly balanced both on offense and defense, and
anyone who saw the Alabama te«tms that Wade brought to the
Rose Bowl games with Stanford and Washington will lend an
interested car to his utterances.
Colgate has scored 2G4 digits, and its goal is ijnsullied, but what about
the competition? You can't say that the victory over Brown makes them
oustanding. They picked on a dead team!
Except for a slight wandering into Princeton's backyard, Michigan
has kept strictly within its own conference, and if you didn't know that
is plenty for any one team, you know it now. They lay for each other
in that circuit like a bunch of wolves, and every game is a "big" one.
If the Wolverines DO come out, there will be plenty of fancy punting,
passing, and defensive work. They play the breaks at Michigan!
For sheer toughness of schedule, and proved worth, you can't
heat that aggregation of giants that pushed the Big Red Machine
around last Saturday. Pittsburgh is just about the most willing
of the bunch, too. So. if Michigan won't come, why not give the
Panthers a break? —R.D.W.Jr.
