# HELVENSTON TO AID IN "GHOSTS"
## Ibsen Play Reading Slated For Thursday Eve 
### 
Harold Helvenston, director of
Stanford dramatics, will read the
role of Oswald in "Ghosts," to be
presented by Sword and Sandals,
men's honorary dramatic fraternity,
next Thursday evening in the Little
Theatre.
The reading will mark Helven
ston's first campus appearance as an
actor, although for the past four
years he has been a backstage in
fluence either as designer or director
of Stanford productions.
Pastor Manders, who represents
the traditions and conventions which
Ibsen detests, will be characterized
by A. Grove Day, alumnus and for
mer campus actor of whose many
appearances, that as Lob in Barrie's
"Dear Brutus," is probably best re
membered.
Robert Cathcart, last seen as
President Wintergi'een in "Of Thee
I Sing," is to read the part of Eng
strand. The role, differing as widely
as it does from that of Winter
green, should show Cathcart's abil
ity and range.
The reading, open to the public,
will begin at 7:30 o'clock. Vallejo
Gantner, president of Sword and
Sandals, urges all who desire to see
it to be in the Little Theatre at that
hour since the doors will be closed
before the curtain rises.
