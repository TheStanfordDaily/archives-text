# Chappie "Wimmen" Issue Off Press By December 8
## 
### 
The last Chappie of this quarter
rolls off the press soon, to become
public property on December 8.
This last issue of Stanford's humor
magazine for 1932 is the "Wimmen"
issue. Wimmen run up and down its
cover, which is already planned, and
pervade its humor. That the "500"
are to be expected to play a large
part in causing the laughs of this
number is not an unreasonable ex
pectation, according to editorial
counsel.
