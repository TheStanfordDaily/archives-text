# Card, Alumni Mermen Meet
## Water Polo Tilt In Encina Pool On Saturday 
### 
The best Stanford "team" in his
tory versus an all-star alumni squad
that on paper appears to be one of
the truly great water polo aggrega
tions of all time.
Fancy superlatives, perhaps, but
accurately descriptive of the battle
of aquatic giants to be played at
2:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon in
Encina Pool.
Teamwork Smooth
A new system of play, patterned
after that of (he Hungarian cham
pionship team, and a new spirit of
teamwork and co-operation promise
to make the 1932-33 Indian water
polo squad the smoothest working
team Stanford has had, though in
dividually the teams of past years
have been stronger. Fewer stars
twinkle in the Indian lineup this
year—in past years it was "Beat
Clapp," or "Beat Booth," and when
that season's particular shining light
WAS stopped, the whole Stanford
offense would all but drown.
Three veterans return from last
spring's water polo squad: Captain
Knapp, goalie; Don Kinkaid, center
back; Ted Wiget, sprint. They will
furnish the steadying influence for
Coach Nort Thornton's flashy sopho
more forwards, Jimmy Benet and
Jimmy Triolo. The guards are Gor
don Graves, a junior, and Vlad
Taranik or Dick Hirsch. The last
two are sophomores, and will divide
playing time. v
McElcvcy in Reserve
The redoubtable alumni team will
line up with Sprint Austin Clapp
and Forwards Frankie Booth and
Ginger Austin. Whitey Burns will
play center back, leaving Woods
and Bramel to play the guard posi
tions, with the brilliant Collett at
guard. World's record-holder John
McElevey will be held in reserve
until his astonishing speed will be
most useful.
The game is likely to develop into
an individual duel between goal
guards Knapp and Collett.
