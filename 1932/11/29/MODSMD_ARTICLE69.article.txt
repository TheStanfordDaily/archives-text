# LITTLE BROWN JUG, "BACON," STUFFED COUGAR SHARE FAME WITH CARDS' AXE
## 
### PAUL ZULCH 
Famous though the Stanford Axe
is, it is not the only college trophy
over which inspired undergraduates
have waged combat.
There is the Little Brown Jug of
Michigan. This modest little object
has had a long and exciting career.
It's not much to look at, but the
students at Ann Arbor will fight
like their namesake Wolverines to
keep the jug on the Michigan cam
pus.
After the Minnesota-Wisconsin
game on the 12th the Wisconsin
Cardinals recaptured the "bacon."
A side of bacon is the prize award
ed to the winner of the annual
Badger-Gopher football tilt. To be
sure, it is not a mummified or fresh
cut of porker which is the coveted
trophy, but a quarter-sawed piece
of good oak, carved and polished to
resemble the meat portion of "bacon
and ." It is labelled on each side
"Bacon," and on one side it is
branded with a "W" and the Uni
versity of Wisconsin seal, while the
other side is adorned with an "M"
and the University of Minnesota

I coat of arms. â€¢
Up at Pullman, Washington, this
I year, the boys from Washington
I State College' got riled up and over
j powered a group of University of
| Washington rooters to destroy a
prized captured cougar. The stuffed
I cougar was pilfered from Washing
l ton State back in 1920. The W.S.C.
j boys, who strive to live up to their
| appellation, "Cougars," naturally re
; sented seeing the stuffed cat flaunted
j in their faces at every football en
| counter with the Washington Hus
! kies.
So this year it happened. At the
| big game of the year for Washing
i ton grid fans, the Cougar supporters
! climbed down out of the stands to
| pounce on the trophy being paraded
I by Husky rooters. A grand free-for
j all melee resulted in a disintegrated
| stuffed prize. A couple of cars and
! pieces of skin were saved for the
W.S.C. trophy case; but the Pullman
fans will not have to watch their
arch rivals carry off the captured
cougar. And the Cougar rooters
i made away with a stuffed husky,
jto boot!
