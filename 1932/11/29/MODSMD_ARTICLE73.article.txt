# WOMEN DISCOVER CHEAPER LIVING IS POSSIBLE NOW
## 
### 
Discovery that financial problems
facing women students here this
quarter have been met by reduced
costs of living was made yesterday
when the Women's Conference met
in the A.W.S. offices with Mary-
Katherine Morris in charge.
Questionnaires that v/ere distri T
buted at the last meeting were re
turned and discussed, the following
problems being gone over: how
various living groups offered ways
for their members to earn money
and put themselves through school,
the cost of house bills, the purchas
ing of food from the Stanford Co
op, the auditing of house books, and
financial aid in the form of emer
gency loans and scholarships as
discussed in provisions of local and
national rules.
The discussion was "very pro
ductive of results," Mary-Katherine
Morris reported, in that many more
girls are being taken care of by
their own groups. Living expenses
have been materially cut through
the minimizing of purchases for the
general groups. Some members are
hashing to pay for their food bills.

Fox- the first time since 1915,
Washington university's football
varsity scheduled a game with the
school alumni this fall.
