After College
WHAT?
Aviation?
I
E. E. Wyman, Assistant to the |
President, Pan-American Airways
System, says: "Aviation is sym- j
pathetic to the college graduate
who has prepared himself. It ;
demands, however, serious and I
thorough preparation: technical I
training, a natural aptitude for i
constant study of problems and [
conditions, and a natural enthusi
asm for the tasks it develops."
AVIATION requires a steady hand !
L for the pilot, a steady mind foi !
the executive. And a good tobacco.., j
like Edgeworth Smoking Tobacco...
is mighty helpful in giving a man a
steady hand, or a steady mind.
Only in Edgeworth will you find
that indefinable distinctiveness that it
brought about by a special blending 1
of fine old burleys. That's why leaa
ng colleges have chosen it as their
favorite tobacco.*
