Plans were made for a concen
trated drive of the fraternities for
the sale of the Tuberculosis Christ
mas Seals yesterday afternoon at a
meeting called by Jack Redhead and
Eunice Force, who are managing the
campaign on the Row.
They appointed three fraternity
men to take charge of the Row.
John Schulte will solicit from Alpha
Tau Omega, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Nu, Delta Tau
Delta, Theta Chi, Theta Xi, and
Chi Psi.
Fred Bold will manage the drive
in Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi,
Delta Chi, Phi Sigma Kappa, Kappa
Alpha, Theta Delta Chi, and Phi
Kappa Sigma. Bob Cranmer will
have charge of Alpha Kappa Lamb
da, Alpha Sigma Phi, Phi Delta
Theta, Delta Upsilon, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Kappa Sigma,
and Zeta Psi.
Dick Van Wagenen, who is carry
ing on the drive in Toyon and five
of the eating clubs, announced his
co-workers yesterday. For the eat
ing clubs they are: Los Arcos, Dick
Van Wagenen; El Capitan, Robert
Mynard; Breakers, Alexander Mc-
Callum; El Campo, Jack Goodrich;
El Cuadro, Douglas Smith; and El
Torp, Gone Mires.
Those who will help in Toyon are
Thornton Hinman, Rolph Malloch,
Bob Quinn, John Schwafel, and Pat
Goodrich, while Jefferis Fitzgerald
will canvass the Union. These men
will attempt to inveigle 25 cents
from each rough who is not a mem
ber of an eating club or some other
organization which has already been
solicited.
As it is often impossible to reach
the graduate student who lives off
campus, arrangements have been
made for seals to be deposited with
the Stanford Y.W.C.A. secretary, on
the third floor of the Women's Club
house, and they can be bought there
any time during the morning and
afternoon during the next week and
a half.
As all the money which is pro
cured from this drive will be used
for the rest homes and the benefit
of the Stanford students, any pur
chases of seals, ranging from a
penny to $25 will be most thank
fully received.
