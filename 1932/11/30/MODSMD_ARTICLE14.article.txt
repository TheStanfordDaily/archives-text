# PROMISE PIE A-PLENTY FOR RELIEF FETE
## All-University Carnival To Feature Heche's Band, Lighting Effects 
### Collier Connell 
Pies—hundreds of pies—make to
day a triumph for "the 500." As yet
embryonic and unbaked," the pies
are nevertheless a concrete achieve
ment, guaranteed to be fresh out of
a score of 'campus ovens on Satur
day afternoon, in time for the fifth
all - University Carnival which
throws open a gala door at 7:30
o'clock Saturday night, to last a
half-dozen houis.
Dancing to the inspiration of Gor
don Heche's Relief Fund orchestra
will mark the time away until mid
night drops an adieu on the campus
Carnival roisterers. Superb shadow
effects in the Pavilion, gained by
adroit lighting, will give grotesque
and thoroughly artistic disfigure
ment to the Pavilion, setting it off
in Carnival mood, a far cry from
its week-day appearance.
Row to Make Candy
"Gigantic donations of foodstuffs"
it- today's battleery from Stanford
freshman women, who from their
first-year stronghold at Roble are
gathering the forces of food together
toward a $1000 goal. Pies, which
crowned yesterday's scouting efforts,
have been promised by the Stanford
Mothers' Club, and the Stanford
Dames. Candy on a no less than
spectacular scale is to be produced
by all sorority houses. Stanford
gentlemen will thus be offered a
new basis for comparison of the nine
saccharine factories on the Row.
National manufacturers have not
yet donated in the liberal fashion of
hist year, so that the Carnival is al
most entirely dependent on dona
tions from campus and Palo Alto
organizations.
Student Fund Benefits
The newly appointed faculty-stu
dent committee, the members of
which were named in yesterday's
Daily, is backing the Carnival to the
limit, since the Students' Relief
Fund, administered by the commit
tee, is sole beneficiary of the affair.
No other student activity has re
ceived such full support from Uni
versity and student administrations,
according to Carnival managers.
Full attendance is promised, since
the Executive Committee has closed
the date, eliminating all other cam
pus activities for that evening.
