# Georgia Boyhood Trained Johnson In Negro Music
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Musician to his fingertips (no j
mean distance, incidentally) Hall ;
Johnson last night expressed his j
pleasure at the reception accorded i
his chorus by the Stanford audience. !
His choir, the leader said, has sung |
often before college audiences, which
particularly appreciate the synco
pated melodies of his race.
Johnson is a native of Georgia,
where he learned the negro songs
from his grandmother, who was a
slave until she was thirty; his
mother was eight when freedom
came. He was a violinist before
1925, when he organized his now
famous choir to fulfill what he felt
a definite need in American music.
The leader was high in his praise
of Stephen C. Foster, saying that
his people regard the American's,

music as a distinct compliment to
their race. "01' Man River," Mr.
Johnson considers a fine piece of
modern writing, true to the melo
dies of his South. "Coin' Home" he
condemned as in no way genuinely
a negro melody, but rather an in
ferior adaptation of Dvorak's beau
tiful Largo.
Not a singer himself, Johnson ar
ranges the melodies for his singers
in such a way as to allow them to
express all their innate spontaneity.
It was Johnson who scored "The
Green Pastures" and trained its
phenomenal chorus. He has also
done some original composing, based
on negro themes.
To this charming Southerner
Stanford owes a vote of thanks for
bringing it some of the most musical
members of a musical race.
