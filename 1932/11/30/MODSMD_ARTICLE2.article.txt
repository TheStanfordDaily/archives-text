# Final Call For Quad Pictures
## 
### 
If the call for Quad pictures goes
unheeded today as it has so far this
week, the Watson studio at 520 Sal
vation-;! will be closed for good,
Editor Ray Hanson announced last
night. If this is done, all those who
have failed to appear for pictures
may have to travel to the main
studios in Berkeley if they wish to
see their faces reproduced in the
1933 yearbook.
Unless the studio schedule is
changed, it will be open from 9 to
12 and from 1 to 4:30 o'clock daily
Ihe rest of this week, to take care
of senio 115, sorority and fraternity
members, Roble residents, and eat
ing club denizens, Hanson said.
Kentucky wagon mines produced
approximately 63,000 tons of coal in
1931.
