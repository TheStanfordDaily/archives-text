# Students To Greet Returning Gridmen In Rally At Depot
## Dismiss 10 o'Clock Classes to Form Parade to Paly; Band to Lead Students in Welcome for Big Red Machine on Return to Campus 
### 
Local sons of the Stanford red will flock to the Palo Alto depot this
morning for a final rousing welcome for that Big Red Machine which has
! rolled over such rough ground this season.
All 10 o'clock classes have been dismissed today, according to Chairman
Hardin Craig of the Committee on Public Exercises. The special train
carrying the Indian gridders home from the lair of the Pitt Panther is
scheduled to reach the Palo Alto terminal of the Southern Pacific at
10:15 o'clock, and plans have been made to meet Pop Warner's proteges

there instead of on the Quad as in
the past. .
Starting Point
The parade will form at the Eng
lish corner immediately after 9
o'clock classes are out and will pro
ceed at once to the station in order
to reach there before the train pulls
in.
Rally Committee Chairman Bob
Churchill urges all students who
have automobiles to bring them to the
starting point in time to form a
gigantic procession which will fol
low the Stanford band to the sta
tion. Those who do not have cars
will be given transportation after
they reach the English corner.
"The team has fought a hard sea
son," Churchill stated. "The least
we can do is get down to the station
and show them that we are back of
them!"
Band to Play
Members of the band will meet
without uniforms, and they may se
cure their instruments between
and 10:05 o'clock at the band house.
Eleven o'clock classes will be held
as usual, it is stressed. All students
are expected to return to the cam
pus after the rally in plenty of time
for their next appointments.
The special train will arrive in
Oakland at 8 o'clock this morning
and will proceed down to the Dum
barton bridge and across to be at
the Redwood City junction by 9:50
o'clock. After backing on to the
peninsula, tracks, it is expected to
unload its cargo of seasoned war
riors in Palo Alto by the time the
cavalcade from the Farm reaches
the depot.
