# Negro Chorus Scores Hit In Blue Numbers
## Campus Audience Cheers Hall Johnson Choir 
### Ellamac Dodds 
Standing before his singers, hold
ing and guiding them with two ner
vous, electric hands upraised and
endlessly moving, Hall Johnson, tall,
thin, bespectacled negro, led his
famous Hall Johnson Negro Chorus
to a veritable triumph last night in
their concert at the Stanford Pavil
ion, the second in the series of 1932-
33 concerts presented by the A.S.S.U.
Twenty negroes, born and brought
up in the South, trained in the
songs and spirituals of their race
since childhood, sang as Hall John
son's hypnotic hands directed, now
sweetly, now harshly, now with in
finite simplicity, now with intricate
complexity. They sang songs of their
forebears in free, polytonal, dra
matic harmonies, holding their audi
ence spellbound.
Their two most popular numbers
were the special arrangements of
"St. James Infirmary Blues" and
the "St. Louis Blues," made by their
conductor. In the spirituals, out
pourings of a people who have
known oppression and hardship, the
chorus ran the whole gamut of hu
man experience and struggle. In
their secular songs there was hu
mor, pathos, bragadocio; an expres
sion, as Hall Johnson himself put it,
"of that rather pathetic mood of
external swagger over internal suf
fering which has produced so many
of these songs of the road and the
rail." One could almost see, as one
listened, the negroes at work in the
cotton fields, the roustabouts on the
little river steamers, the workers
on the levee.
Responding to the tremendous and
insistent applause that followed each
number, the chorus sang eight en
cores, achieving surprising orches
tral effects, syncopated and thud
ding rhythms, and richness of tonal
quality.
