# OUT OF CHICAGO-A NEW RACKET
## 
### 
Something new in college racketeering come lo light on
Ihe I'arm yesterday when a cor la in fraternity received a
green post-card folder from (Chicago. Something sort of
significant about that coming from Chicago, from whence
have emanated the liquor racket and ils allied sloughs of
endeavor. Strangely enough, this Greek fraternity racket
also carries with it the smell of (' ll,Oil.
Within the green folder the Stanford fraternity men
found "The Truth about Kappa Beta Phi" and "The Truth
about Theta \u Epsilon," two blurby paragraphs which
boil down the information concerning these two organiza
tions which appears in that old standby, Haird's Manual.
These paragraphs are smoothly hypocritical, entirely fail
ing to mention the true nature of the orders. The only
eltie dropped for the casual reader is the stein which ap
pears in the upper right-hand corner of an artist's repro
duction of the Kappa Hete key.
The man \\lio sits in the "national headquarters" of
both fraternities at Hox 1000, Merchandise Mart Station,
(.liieago (the return address given), must be an opportunist
of the old school, lie encloses a price list of T.N.E. and
Kappa liete membership cards, shingles, keys, official pins,
even sister pins. Furthermore, any college group may
receive a complete charter and ritual of either order for
*10 and C.0.1). charges. The self-appointed national sec
retary seems very exclusive.
Sending one of his green circulars to Stanford was, of
course, a cent and a half's postage wasted, for the soil on
the Farm is 100 dry and too sterile for that type of cultiva
tion. Hut the racket will probably reap ils harvest at that,
for somewhere, at some colleges, little groups of tipplers
will fall for the "national organization and reputation"
line. Greater suckers still will be the clandestine chapters
of f.X.F. and Kappa Hete who will report themselves, as
requested, and lay themselves open lo the financial support
which will undoubtedly be sought bv the Chicago "head
quarters."
All of which off-color racketeering will leave fair Stan
lord high and dry, where it was in the first place, for the
element of rowdyism and bacchanulianism which is syn
onymous with the names of those two orders will certainly
have no foothold here. Fven if it had. Stanford men would
never be such suckers, we hope.
