# BULL SESSION
## MORE BREAKS 
### 
As is well krlown, another
Thanksgiving recess has come and
gone. It has meant different things
to different people. To some, a dim
realization of too much turkey. To
some, a dimmer realization of too
much holiday cheer. To all the
women, an oppressive burden of
countless calories. To everyone, a
rest and a change—a break from
what has been.
In that the vacation was such a
great success, why not have more
of them? Obviously, they can't all
be Thanksgiving holidays. But they
can be holidays of some description
or the other. The nomenclature is a
mere side issue—to be decided later.
Each quarter could easily stand to
be split by two extended weekends.
Immediately, the professors who
are always six weeks behind their
own syllabus schedule after the first
week of school, scream and cry.
Their plaintive wailings could be
ignored on the grounds that six days
out of the quarter will not com
pletely destroy the educational sys
tem. But being big of heart and kind
of soul generally, and particularly
sympathetic with irritable peda
gogues, we propose that these pre
cious days be made up by a short
ended summer vacation. Two weeks
could be clipped off the summer
splurge, and thus the requisite
number of days would be found for
the increased supply of vacations for
the three quarters.
Anything new must have a rea
son. Why change the old order?
The advantages are numerous—like
the sand in your shoes after a
steak-bake at Half Moon Bay. First
of all, it makes possible a period of

| concerted study for those that have
I forgotten that the "Winds of Free
! dom Are Blowing" does not refer
|to the foggy breezes in a rumble
seat headed toward San Francisco
| along the bayshore.
| Every once in a while, one gets
! (or should get) a terrible feeling
j that the Registrar is about to yank
j by the neck and boot severely with
I his foot. Just then, one of our vaca-
I tions |could heave intoj sight
i would be a "life-saver," bromo-
I seltzer, and scholastic beefsteak all
I rolled into one. It would give the
student three days in which to draw
J himself out of the mire of indolence
j and the slough of hopelessness.
I These respites — two a quarter —
! would be great times to turn out
j lengthy term papers, and other an
j noyanees of University life.
• Secondly, for those who had
i studied, it would be a wonderful
I period of rest, lelaxation, recupera-
I tion, and resuscitation. Three days
of blissful slumber and Mother's
cooking would lil! everyone with an
increased desire to live and be
ihappy.
! The big drawback to the whole
idea is manifest. What about the
I majority who don't study during
the quarter and who would prob
| ably do even less during the pro
posed vacations? There is only one
! way in which the plan might pos-
I sibly touch them. That is after they
| sobered up (both meanings'), they
{might be inspired by the envious
position of those that had utilized
the vacation properly to snap out
of it and do something themselves.
I Probably, they wouldn't, however,
j Very probably ....
