### BY OLD DR. ALGAR 
If I hadn't paid good money
to see it,
I would have thought it was
funny.
" 'Will husbands and wives be i
united in the next world?' is among j
Ihe questions Dr. Kerrison Juniper]
of the First Congregational Church j
will discuss tomorrow evening. I
Other questions in the list are such
as 'What place has the supernatural
in the scientific world?' and 'What
do you think of the future of the
Chinese government?'"—San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
By the way, Doctor, do you think
we can take up those two topics you
said we'd discuss last time: "Where |
do last Winter's mothballs go in the |
Spring?" and "Why vote for peanut j
brittle?"
WASHINGTON — "Squad's right" j
in the Army appears to he doomed, i
A simplified drill with which the
regular Army and various militia
regiments have been experimenting
does away altogether with "squads j
right" and "squads left."
All the drill ground was abristlc
With the nation's martial might.
But a solemn fear throughout
the ranks
Gave hint that things weren't I

I right.
Then the general's, fare turned
crimson,
Oh, 'twas not a pretty sight,
When the corporal forgot himself
And bellowed out "Squads right!"
CHICAGO — Feodor Chaliapin,
Russian has a good deal of
work to do before he completes his
j autobiography. "It is only begun,"
he said. "I have not yet touched
| upon my love life, and this un
doubtedly will require many daring
j chapters."—S.F. Examiner.
"I don't want to he remem
bered as somebody who couldn't
do anything but take her clothes
off before a camera."—Clara
Bow.
