groans to the effect that the drama j

I trarily selected "best plays" have
| risen considerably in quality since :

value, such stuff as Adam and Eva,

j Bells, and Abraham Lincoln.
More recently, if Mantle has
! leaned heavily toward cheap fantasy
! and moral comedy, there is a pre- '
i ponderance of really fine drama in !
; his selection. This year, for exam
j pie, if one does discover The Devil
j Passes and The Animal Kingdom
; there is, in balance, Reunion in I
j Vienna, Of Thee I Sing, Cynara,
■ Another Language, and Mourning
{ Becomes Electra.
j Besides this weakness for soup
allegory and thinly philosophic
j mysticism, Mantle seems to favor
j anything which may possibly be
i called folk drama above far more 1
] worthy pieces. Green Grow the :
; Lilacs and Alison's House, for* ex- :
J ample, were included in and Pri- !

vate Lives excluded from the 10151

The true folk element in Lynn
Figgs' melodrama was its music, en
tirely lost in a printed version,
while even a condensation could not
harm the brittle hilarity of the
Coward play.
Mantle cannot ever quite decide
whether to make his selection a
popular or an artistic one. The re
sult is a hodge-podge but a con
venient record.
