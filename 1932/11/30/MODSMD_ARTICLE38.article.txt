THE THEATRE LEAGUE. INC., |
AND BRIEF MOMENT. With
some reference to the unprecari
ous condition of the theatre.
I The New York Theatre Guild j
: several years ago organized enough
persons in several eastern cities to
assure profitable audiences for tour- !
ing companies of Guild plays. On j
j the West Coast a similar movement i
has been started in The Theatre
i League, whose purpose it is, rather
presumptively, "to save the legiti
i mate drama."
Now the drama, which, according j
jto the pessimistic of all ages, has
i been dying since the days of Aeschy
-1 lus, does go through thin seasons; j
j but that it needs saving I contest
1 violently.
i Presumptive as this group's pur
! pose may be, however, its program, !
as begun, shows promise of develop
! ing into a valuable production '
5 group.
Advance report reveals that sev- !
; eral cities are already enrolled in
i the League's activities: Pasadena, !
| the producing center (plays are to '
i be directed by Gilmor Brown and
, first performed at the Community '
' Playhouse), San Diego, Stockton, j
| and Fresno.
i The latter cities will find the >
| movement a boon, since production
| there has been almost entirely that i
I of sporadically appearing and short- j
i lived stock companies. Even tour- 1
| ing groups from the East—as few of !
I them as have courage to cross the (
' Rockies—are satisfied to piny the
! coast cities, leaving the valley towns j
i to their dismal if not tragic cine- !
i matic lot.
I The League's first play is S. N. :
Behrman's "Brief* Moment." It (
opens at the Curran Theatre, San j
; Francisco, next Monday.

' THE BEST PLAYS OF 19.11-32 and
the yearbook of the drama in
America. Edited by Burns Mantle.
| Dodd, Mead. 1932. (At the Gordon
Strawbridge Library.)
It is interesting to note, in spite
' of the annual flood of managerial '
groans to the effect that the drama j
] is breathing its last, that the arbi-

I trarily selected "best plays" have
| risen considerably in quality since :
! the first yearbook edited by Mantle
| appeared in 1920.
In that year the selection in
i eluded, among some plays of higher
value, such stuff as Adam and Eva,
Declasse, Mama's Affair, Wedding.
j Bells, and Abraham Lincoln.
More recently, if Mantle has
! leaned heavily toward cheap fantasy
! and moral comedy, there is a pre- '
i ponderance of really fine drama in !
; his selection. This year, for exam
j pie, if one does discover The Devil
j Passes and The Animal Kingdom
; there is, in balance, Reunion in I
j Vienna, Of Thee I Sing, Cynara,
■ Another Language, and Mourning
{ Becomes Electra.
j Besides this weakness for soup
allegory and thinly philosophic
j mysticism, Mantle seems to favor
j anything which may possibly be
i called folk drama above far more 1
] worthy pieces. Green Grow the :
; Lilacs and Alison's House, for* ex- :
J ample, were included in and Pri- !

vate Lives excluded from the 10151
volume.
The true folk element in Lynn
Figgs' melodrama was its music, en
tirely lost in a printed version,
while even a condensation could not
harm the brittle hilarity of the
Coward play.
Mantle cannot ever quite decide
whether to make his selection a
popular or an artistic one. The re
sult is a hodge-podge but a con
venient record.
The comments upon seasons west
of New York are badly organized
and entirely uneritic 1. A mere list
ing would have been more intel
ligible, neater. — Sandoe
