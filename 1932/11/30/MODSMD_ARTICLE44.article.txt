TIIE REPORTS FROM DOWN LOS ANGELES way to the
effect that Pop Warner is going to resign, keep right on coming up
tliis way despite repeated denials from most of Stanford's official
sources.
There are a few alumni in that end of the state, and perhaps a few up j
here too, who feel that the only way to get the Farm back on the football j
map is to give Warner the air.
For the benefit of wolves in general, and our quarterbacking alumni j
in particular, we should like to point out that Stanford has the first good
freshman team this year that the Farm has had in longer than we care i
to remember, that Warner has NOT had the best material in the world, j
and that alumni don't always know best. There seems to be an impression j
hi the heads of some of these old boys, and you can just about get them j
on the fingers of your two hands, that an alumnus knows all there is to :
know about coaching the football team, and that if the team doesn t win
there is only one cure.
Now last year the alumni, among others, okehed Mr. Warner's
contract for another five years, and now that he lias lost a few ,
battles, they turn around and start yapping.
As far as we're concerned there is just this to itâ€”Warner was given !
another contract, and therefore he has a certain right to some support, ;
and although each and every alumnus will swear allegiance to dear old j
Steenford, it is not good cricket to put your rooter's hat on and then go ;
around kicking coaches in the seat of the pants. There would be an i
awfully sore bunch of alumni if we should happen to print the names of
those who are after coaching scalps right now.
We've had some gripes to air in this column ourselves now and then,
but they were in regard td individual men, and where we have been
proved wrong we have laid off.
Now, our idea is this. Why not get a few men like last year's
frosh aggregation in here for a couple of years, and then it Stan
ford football doesn't start up the grade, junk your coach, junk all
the coaches, and get a new deal?
DID YOU KNOW THAT Ernie Smith, in addition to having large feet
and tho ability to play in his own band, has one. of the best averages in
the University of Southern California? R.D.W.Jr. j
