# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM WORKS OUT IN FALL PRACTICE
## Pitching Staff Prospects Appear Good; Teams Not Yet Chosen 
### Charles Clancy 
Quietly arid without publicity, a
large squad of baseball hopefuls
under Coach Harry Wolters are
working out three times a week on
the varsity diamond. The practices
to date have been informal; no
teams have been chosen, and in
tensive workouts have been rare.
Fall practice to baseball is what
spring practice is to football. Play
ers work on their weaknesses, the
coach looks over his material and
concentrates on individual instruc
tion rather than team play.
Prospects Good
Prospects for a strong pitching
staff look exceptionally good. With
the close of the football season it is
expected that Stan Anderson, ace of
the Stanford twirling staff, will
soon be in uniform.
Anderson, a steady and competi
tive athlete, will probably bear the
brunt of the pitching duties during
the coming season. Estes, a veteran,
Heringer, of last year's freshman
squad, Savinske, Stark, and Camp
bell are fast getting into shape. I
Herm Estes is a curve-ball artist i
with good control and plenty of ex- j
perience. He is certain to see mound i
duty this spring.
Stark Improving
Heringer has showij, a great deal
of improvement over last year and
he may see action. His principal
pitching forte is speed. Harry Stark
is improving his control which was
a bit shaky last season, and he may
get a chance to pitch.
Art Hearn, veteran first-sacker,
will have plenty of competition for
the regular berth in Mallatratt and
Bacon. Mallatratt is a sophomore.
He handles himself around the ini- I
tial sack with characteristic ease. ;
Bacon also appears to be a good
man.
Second Open
Second base is wide open with j
several good men fighting it out for I
the job. The most promising of these !
is Jim Wooley, a member of last
year's freshman team. Millsap is
pressing him hard, however. i
