# Theta Sigma Phi Calls Meeting Of All Pledges
## 
### 
Theta Sigma Phi pledges will meet
at 1 o'clock today in the Journalism
library to discuss plans with the
president, Helen Forsyth, plans for
the tea to be given on Thursday,
December 8.
The tea will feature a fashion
show and gift display which will
offer many helpful suggestions to
prospective Christmas shoppers.
Presenting the latest modes from
coats to lingerie, the fashion show
will make a very complete array.
The gifts will be exhibited and
fashions paraded for two hours, so
that guests may drop in to "gabble,
gobble, and git," or may stay for
the whole entertainment.
