# Jazz Hit Campus In 1913 ‘Ragtime' Made Entrance At Senior Ball Tango Replaced Waltz
## 
### Rolph Malloch 
Jazz made its first appearance at ;
a Stanford dance just 19 years ago.
The incentive for dancing at that i
time—l9l3—was very different from |
the harmonious syncopation of to- j
day's musicians.
It was at the Senior Ball held in !
the Vendome Hotel in San Jose that 1
Irving Perkins, pianist, and a group
of six other musicians played the j
first notes of jazz officially for a j
Stanford dance.
At that time, the music was called i
"ragtime," and the orchestra con- j
sisted of an aecordian, two banjos, !
a trombone, and a drum, in addi- ;
tion to the piano.
This was a big step from the
orchestras of violins, flutes, and
'cellos which had formerly furnished
dance music, and it pleased students!
so greatly that the same band was j
asked to play at half a dozen house j

dances during the following year,
I as well as several subsequent Senior j
| Ealls.
Numerous groups of students
1 started to form their own jazz or
chestras at this time, just before the
World War. Formerly, dance pro- ,
grams had consisted of two-steps,
j waltzes, and classical selections. In )
1913 the style changed to the tango, I
j the "hesitation," and jazz.
The jazz orchestras at that time
illustrated the idea of every man i
i for himself: the more noise an in- |
i strument made, the more worthy
the player. It is only since the war 1
that the saxaphone has become,
| widely used.
Pieces popular in the "old days" !
included the "Maurice Tango," "In- 1
ternational Rag," "That's How I j
1 Need You," "When I Leave the j
World Behind," and "Too Much
1 Mustard."
