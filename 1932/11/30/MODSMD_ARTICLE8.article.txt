# Wrenn Talks On Habits Of Concentration
## 
### 
"Concentration is not a mental
quality but the building up of men
tal habits," said Dr. C. Gilbert
Wrenn in an informal lecture on
"Habits of Concentration" held last
night in Room 201 of the English
Building. This was the second of a
series of talks being given by Dr.
Wrenn to aid students, especially
those in their first quarter at Stan
ford, in perfecting their methods of
study.
Mental factors involved are much
more important than the physical
environment, and noisy rooms are
just used as an cxcuse, Dr. Wrenn
continued. He classified habits of
concentration under three main
heads, those of time and place, man
ner of reading, and the initial at
tack.
The establishing of definite place
and time for study, were placed as
of prime importance in developing
concentration. "Short intensive
study periods with definite periods
of relaxation are best," he said. He
warned the college student to defi
nitely guard against getting into a
habit of passive reading, which he
labeled as "a very pernicious habit."
As his third point, Dr. Wrenn urged
students to start doing something
the moment they sit down to study.
The putting down in writing of one's
first thoughts acts as a stimulus and
aids greatly in concentration, he
said.
Dr. Wrenn named three pamph
lets which might "be obtained at the
Bookstore which may be nelpful to
students finding difficulty in getting
along. These are "Manual of Read
ing Exercises for College Students,"
"Essential Preparation for College,"
and "Practical Study Aids."
Next Tuesday's lecture will be on
"Note Taking," Dr. Wrenn an
nounced.
