| An exhibition of photographs of
scenes in the "High Sierras" is .be
j ing shown at the Stanford Art Gal
lery until December 14. The pic
tures are a collection photographed

I during the summer while on a
i motor trip from the Lake Tahoe re
j gion through Yosemite Valley and
| the Kern River section.
Scenes include views in Desola
tion Valley, Tuolomne Meadows,
and Kern River. Unusual scenes are
shown of Yosemite Valley in winter
! and mountain top views showing
; wind-blown trees against the sky.
i Critics, consider that Dr. Wilson se
â€¢ cures unusually fine sky qualities
in his photographs and that this ex
hibition equals his former collec
tions shown some years ago.
This collection of photographs is
the second of a series of photo
! graphic art being shown at Stanford
] Art Gallery during this year. The
| gallery Is open to the public with
! out admission charge from 10 until
