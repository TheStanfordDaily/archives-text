How to keep silt and sand from clogging tele
phone cable ducts was one problem put up to
engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories. No
known method of joining sections of vitrified clay
conduit effected a seepage-tight joint.
With scientific thoroughness, telephone men
made many tests under service conditions. They
devised a bandage of cheese-cloth, waterproof
paper and mortar. Easily made and applied, this
mortar bandage is tight against silt and sand. It
prevents clogging, greatly simplifies the installation
of new telephone cables and the removal of old ones.
Through ( solving such interesting problems,
Hell System men work steadily nearer to their goal
— telephone service of highest possible efficiency.
