### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 30 (JP)—Col- !
j onel Charles A. Lindbergh, with of- i
ficials of the Pan-American Air- j
■ ways, unfolded plans today for |
I transoceanic aviation by which they j
! hope to dominate intercontinental |
| air transportation.
Within two years this air line I
| plans to set out upon oceanic sched- I
ules a fleet of four-motored, all- '
metal, monoplane "clipper ships."
As were the "clipper ships" of
| sailing days, these air liners, built j
for efficiency rather than for size, 1
will be sent into the trade routes to j
gain for American aviation the su- j
premacy in passenger and pay load
traffic.
