### 
With the official acceptance by the
University of California of the plan
for making the Axe a trophy for
the winner of the Big Game in the
hands of Bill Corbus, A.S.S.U.
president, a joint committee will
meet at Berkeley some time next
quarter to discuss an appropriate
ceremony for presentation of the
trophy and the mounting of the Axe
in a suitable setting
Plans Next Quarter
Since the fall semester at the
University of California is nearly
over, no plans can be made until
after the Christmas vacation. The
letter of acceptance to Bill Corbus
from Powell H. Hader, president of
A.S.U.C., follows:
"The Associated Students of the
University of California appreciate
the gracious proposal on the part of
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University that the Ax be made
a Big Game trophy, and hereby
agree to such a proposal. We de
sire to signify our willingness to
co-operate in every way possible in
making and keeping the tradition
one which will be a credit to both
universities.
Create Good Will
"We will be glad to help plan an
appropriate ceremony for presenta
tion of the Ax to the victorious
team. The method of making such
plans that you have suggested is
agreeable to us. A meeting of the
two committees could be arranged
some time next semester.
"We feel that development of such
a tradition can do much to create a
more wholesome rivalry between
our institutions. California hopes to
return to Stanford the good will
which your students have shown
toward ours in making such a gen
erous offer.
"Sincerely,
"Powell H. Rader"
