# "Ole Man Depression" Dogs Campus Bookstore
## 
### Ann Bacon 
Good times may be just around !
the corner, but the Bookstore would
| like more specific instructions as to
; just what corner it is. A sales drop
of 25 per cent features the autumn
| quarter for this center of student
shopping. The decline is general, not
! centralized in any one department.
Rough estimation discloses a drop
of approximately 20 per cent in the ,
Miscellaneous and Textbook depart
ments, while a 40 per cent decline
is indicated in the Stationery and
Tyepwriter departments. The Gen
eral Book division remains about |
the same in the number of sales.
Whether it is due to "Ole Man
I Depression" or not has not been ,

| determined, but college students'
tastes run to black now; so reports
the Typewriter department. "Col
ored typewriter ribbons are a thing
!of the past and are very seldom
called for," says the head of this
I division. One thing that has gone
up since the depression, however,
i.s the renting of typewriters. It is
j estimated there is an increase of
10 per cent in the number of ma
chines out this year.
One of the few new items intro
duced this year was the notebook
covers with the Stanford Seal and
colors on it. Those have the distinc
tion of being the best sellers of the
imonth, a record of 500 being sold.
