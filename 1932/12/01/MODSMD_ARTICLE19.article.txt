# CONCERT SERIES FACING DEFICIT
## Negro Chorus Brings Profit, Leaving $537 Shortage 
### 
In spite of the fact that the
A.S.SU.. Concert Series met ex
penses on the program presented
by the Hall Johnson chorus last
Tuesday night, it is faced with a
season's deficit of $537.00.
Charles E. Karl, student manager,
in a report last night before the
Executive Committee of the A.S.S.U.
made these figures public. The fact
that only $76.00 was realized on a
budget of $400.00 dollars in the first
concert of the current series ac
counts for the huge liability.
The Hall Johnson concert petted
a total of $402.00 on a $400.00 bud
get. Karl felt that at least one hun
dred dollars more would have been
realized on the last concert if ad
verse weather conditions had not
prevailed.
The student manager deplored the
fact that Stanford students were
not living up to the pledge of sup
port given the Concert Series in a
campus vote held last year. "The
only reason the Concert Series was
continued this year was because of
this pledge," he said. Karl expressed
grave doubt that the Series would
be continued in the future if the
1932-33 season budget is not met.
Karl voiced the opinion that the
program to be given by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra un
der the direction of Molinari, Janu
ary 18, and a recital on May 12 by
Yehudi Menuhin, child violin pro
tege, will attract good audiences
and the deficit can be made up.
However, he added that "the suc
cess or failure of the Series de
pends entirely on the Stanford stu
dent body.''
