### 
With a three-woman debate team
! from Girls' High School, of San
| Francisco, as its first opponent the
I freshman debaters go forth into
I verbal battle this afternoon to test
| the mettle of their tongue-shaped
swords. They support the negative
i side of the question, "Resolved, That
I national advertising is more detri
| mental than beneficial to society,"
against the Girls' High representa
| tives in the Women's Clubhouse at
' 3 o'clock.
A second Class of '36 forensic
j squad also gets its first taste of
| battle today debating against Low
i ell High School, of San Francisco,
'at 8 o'clock this evening in the
auditorium of that high school. Their
adversaries there will be three of
l the outstanding masculine high
! school debaters. They too take the
negative side of the same question.
Standard Method Style
That group which will dispute
the right of the affirmative position
i of the Girls' High arguers comprises
Roy Anderson, Kendal Dazey, and
Henry Lowenstein. The team which
travels to San Francisco tonight is
composed of Myron Birnbaum, Max
'Gruenberg, and David Mellinkoff.
The debate style to be used at
both controversies is to be that
[ standard method which tolerates no
j interruptions and is the simplest
i procedure. Later, coached by the
debate coaches William Hawley
! Davis and Lee Chapin, they will
! tackle the other more complicated
styles if they can develop that fast.
Twenty men are already trying out
for these freshman teams and the
i competition should act as an incen
; tive to progress.
Other debates for the first-year
debaters are being sought for next
year with the University of Cali
fornia freshman and with teams
from San Jose State Teachers Col
lege, Fresno State Teachers College,
San Francisco University, San
Francisco State Teachers College,
| and those of other nearby colleges.
