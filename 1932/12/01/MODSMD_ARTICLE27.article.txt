Matmen in Exhibit
With the varsity matmen in an
j exhibition opener, the wrestling is
| promised to turn all-Carnival, with
J a sort of free-for-all challenge
j brawl which the committee hopes
j will develop into something big.
I Legitimate refereeing is promised,
! and although the field will be
thrown open to all-comers, steps
will be taken to eliminate foul play.
Roble residents, after thinking hard,
decided on a good trophy for the
final winner.
Chief of the several virtues which
| makes this Cai nival worthy to rep-
I resent the species Carnivalia is the
j music of the Heche Relief Fund
I band, which will play for dancing
j from the opening hour of 7:30
j o'clock to the final door-closing at
j midnight. A space will be roped o(T
j for dancers, and members of the;
l gallery will have to qualify as
| fence-climbers if they want to cut
I in free.
SI.OOO Goal Set
Food, home-made, and in quanti
i ties ample enough to appeal to the
I largest capacity in the crowd, will
: find its way from scores of campus
I and Palo Alto kitchens into the
! Pavilion in time to stay the hunger
of the Roughs.
A women's "Disguise the Pavilion"

jin remarkable devorative effect.
With $1,000 the Carnival goal for

flashy whip from Helvenston's
Gaieties chorus.
Matmen in Exhibit
With the varsity matmen in an
j exhibition opener, the wrestling is
| promised to turn all-Carnival, with
J a sort of free-for-all challenge
j brawl which the committee hopes
j will develop into something big.
I Legitimate refereeing is promised,
! and although the field will be
thrown open to all-comers, steps
will be taken to eliminate foul play.
Roble residents, after thinking hard,
decided on a good trophy for the
final winner.
Chief of the several virtues which
| makes this Cai nival worthy to rep-
I resent the species Carnivalia is the
j music of the Heche Relief Fund
I band, which will play for dancing
j from the opening hour of 7:30
j o'clock to the final door-closing at
j midnight. A space will be roped o(T
j for dancers, and members of the;
l gallery will have to qualify as
| fence-climbers if they want to cut
I in free.
SI.OOO Goal Set
Food, home-made, and in quanti
i ties ample enough to appeal to the
I largest capacity in the crowd, will
: find its way from scores of campus
I and Palo Alto kitchens into the
! Pavilion in time to stay the hunger
of the Roughs.
A women's "Disguise the Pavilion"
! committee is working now on piano
! to convert the gaunt interior of the
i building into a "clown's interpreta
: tion of the Carnival spirit." Smash
: ing color and black shadow will give
: the Carnivalees their money's worth
jin remarkable devorative effect.
With $1,000 the Carnival goal for
I the Student Relief Fund, donations
I of food and trophies are still being
| urged from campus and Palo Alto
| societies. Helen Ullmann, Kappa
j Kappa Gamma, is general chairman
I of the Carnival.
ANN ROESNER'S sinuous squad of Carnival Wrestlers, borrowed for
the occasion from Coach Harry Maloney, are scheduled to stage an
exhibition of the old Greek art such as fashionable campus society lias
never had previous opportunity to see. This to happen at the fifth all-
University Carnival which sweeps next Saturday night life into the
