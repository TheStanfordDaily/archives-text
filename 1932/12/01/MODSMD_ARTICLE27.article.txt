# Carnival Plans Promise Gayest Autumn Event
## Novel Wrestlers, Heche Relief Fund Band to Provide Major Part of Entertainment; Flashy Colors, Black Shadows To Be Featured 
### 
ANN ROESNER'S sinuous squad of Carnival Wrestlers, borrowed for
the occasion from Coach Harry Maloney, are scheduled to stage an
exhibition of the old Greek art such as fashionable campus society lias
never had previous opportunity to see. This to happen at the fifth all-
University Carnival which sweeps next Saturday night life into the
Pavilion in the gayest campus event of autumn quarter.
Four varsity wrestlers are being given secret workouts by a special
committee of the 500. under the inspired direction of Coach Ann Roesner,

flashy whip from Helvenston's
Gaieties chorus.
Matmen in Exhibit
With the varsity matmen in an
exhibition opener, the wrestling is
promised to turn all-Carnival, with
a sort of free-for-all challenge
brawl which the committee hopes
will develop into something big.
Legitimate refereeing is promised,
and although the field will be
thrown open to all-comers, steps
will be taken to eliminate foul play.
Roble residents, after thinking hard,
decided on a good trophy for the
final winner.
Chief of the several virtues which
makes this Carnival worthy to rep-
resent the species Carnivalia is the
music of the Heche Relief Fund
band, which will play for dancing
from the opening hour of 7:30
o'clock to the final door-closing at
midnight. A space will be roped off
for dancers, and members of the
gallery will have to qualify as
fence-climbers if they want to cut
in free.
$1,000 Goal Set
Food, home-made, and in quanti
ties ample enough to appeal to the
largest capacity in the crowd, will
find its way from scores of campus
and Palo Alto kitchens into the
Pavilion in time to stay the hunger
of the Roughs.
A women's "Disguise the Pavilion"
committee is working now on plans
to convert the gaunt interior of the
i building into a "clown's interpreta
: tion of the Carnival spirit." Smash
ing color and black shadow will give
the Carnivalees their money's worth
in remarkable decorative effect.
With $1,000 the Carnival goal for
the Student Relief Fund, donations
of food and trophies are still being
urged from campus and Palo Alto
societies. Helen Ullmann, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, is general chairman
of the Carnival.

Kappa Gamma, is general chairman
of the Carnival.
ANN ROESNER'S sinuous squad of Carnival Wrestlers, borrowed for
the occasion from Coach Harry Maloney, are scheduled to stage an
exhibition of the old Greek art such as fashionable campus society lias
never had previous opportunity to see. This to happen at the fifth all-
University Carnival which sweeps next Saturday night life into the
Pavilion in the gayest campus event of autumn quarter.
Four varsity wrestlers are being given secret workouts by a special
committee of the 500. under the inspired direction of Coach Ann Roesner,

flashy whip from Helvenston's
Gaieties chorus.
Matmen in Exhibit
With the varsity matmen in an
exhibition opener, the wrestling is
promised to turn all-Carnival, with
a sort of free-for-all challenge
brawl which the committee hopes
will develop into something big.
Legitimate refereeing is promised,
and although the field will be
thrown open to all-comers, steps
will be taken to eliminate foul play.
Roble residents, after thinking hard,
decided on a good trophy for the
final winner.
Chief of the several virtues which
makes this Carnival worthy to rep-
resent the species Carnivalia is the
music of the Heche Relief Fund
band, which will play for dancing
from the opening hour of 7:30
o'clock to the final door-closing at
midnight. A space will be roped off
for dancers, and members of the
gallery will have to qualify as
fence-climbers if they want to cut
in free.
$1,000 Goal Set
Food, home-made, and in quanti
ties ample enough to appeal to the
largest capacity in the crowd, will
find its way from scores of campus
and Palo Alto kitchens into the
Pavilion in time to stay the hunger
of the Roughs.
A women's "Disguise the Pavilion"
committee is working now on plans
to convert the gaunt interior of the
i building into a "clown's interpreta
: tion of the Carnival spirit." Smash
ing color and black shadow will give
the Carnivalees their money's worth
in remarkable decorative effect.
With $1,000 the Carnival goal for
the Student Relief Fund, donations
of food and trophies are still being
urged from campus and Palo Alto
societies. Helen Ullmann, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, is general chairman
of the Carnival.
