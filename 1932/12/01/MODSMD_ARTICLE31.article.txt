When Stanford proposed to California two weeks ago
that Hie Axe be put up as a trophy, it was pretty much a
cinch that l .C. would concur. Two years of watching the
weapon lie dving in a hank vault brought realization !o
the IVrkeleyans that there was no other sane plan which
would save it from passing completely out ot Big Game
history.
However, those who knew that California unofficially
scorned an unofficial suggestion of the same nature two
years ago, soon after Stanford had recovered the Axe,
were not quite certain what the A.S.I .C.'s official reply to
Stanford's recent official proposal would be.
Yesterday thai reply, written bv Powell Under in be
half of the California student body, of which he is presi
dent, was received by Hill Corbus, A.S.S.U. prexv. It was a
hearty endorsement of the plan, an expression of Califor
nia's appreciation, and an assurance that I .C. would co
operate in every way to make the presentation ceremony
all it ought to be.
