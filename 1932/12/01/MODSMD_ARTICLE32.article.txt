Ihc doom of any educational instil lit ion is in tlic im
mediate oiling when Hie bars are let down so that anyone
may enter its sacred halls. When classes become crowded
with a great mass of students who tend to lower the aver
age beyond a normal level, then those classes 110 longer
I'iiHill their educational function.
A recent report from the University of Washington
shilcs that I hey are contemplating admitting any student,
regardless of 11is average, who is a graduate of any high
school. If the University of Washington wishes to be
thought of as an educational institution, and this seems
to be the only reason for its being, il cannot tolerate such
a policy. •
II is a recognized fact among educators that graduating
from high-school, the mere receipt of a diploma, does not
qualify anyone for higher education. In the first place, the
relative merits of high-schools stretch over a tremendous
range. Furthermore, there are many students who arc
graduated from high-school after a certain number of years
because lliev are clogging up the classes, because it is
fell the effort they have shown deserves some recognition,
or because, and this is the most deadly, they have just
managed to meet the requirements for a diploma.
The University of Washington, which has always been
respected for its educational work, and which has been
noted for the loyalty of its alumni, may find that it has lost
some of this respect and loyally if il goes through with this
plan to let down the entrance bars. Friends of this north
ern institution can but bemoan such an action as it implies
a desertion from the true meaning and purpose of a uni
versity.
