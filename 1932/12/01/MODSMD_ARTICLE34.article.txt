# BULL SESSION
## IT'S GREAT TO BE RIGHT 
### 
It is the height of ill manners to
admit that you are right. It is in
dicative of an inflated ego, and a
deflated sense of propriety to calmly
state that your own opinions are
correct. However, we propose to do
just that thing. It will irritate those
that read and is supposed to irritate
those that write such stuff—but it
really doesn't.
Some time ago, when the Concert
Series first started to struggle, it
was here announced that the defi
cits would continue to grow until
popular artists with popular pro
grams were introduced. We felt that
the Campus was not overly-infested
with real music-lovers —keyed to
appreciate the so-called intellectual
music. As various managers have
sweated and prayed only to find red
ink all over their books at the end,
the truth of that sad idea has been
verified and re-verified.
It was somehow felt that at a uni
versity, the student ears should be
pitched to the beauty of the highest
types of music. Mounting deficits
completely disproved that notion.
The Hall Johnson choir the other
night proved that the Campus will
support a popular program. Espe
cially is this so when there is heart
appeal in the artists. There is some
thing mildly spectacular and dif
ferent in 20 negroes presenting such
a concert. There is a "punch"—in a
restrcted sense of the word.
A bustling manager capitalized
that "punch"; and the concert broke
even and may even make a shadow
of profit. That is startling news in

(his year of depression when more
vulgar types of amusement such as
football are gargling with red ink;
and choking to death on unpaid
bills. The Johnson singers are not
shoddy musical entertainment, but
they are lower on the scale than a
Wagnerian symphony recital. Let us
say simply that they have a more
general appeal.
The San Francisco Symphony is
the next number on the Concert
Series. They can make or break the
financial back of this institution. If
they load upon the much-beaten
back of the Concert Series great
doses of Bach, Beethoven, and Wag
ner, all is losl. The series will
crumble, and tumble into the red.
If they offer a well-diversified pro
gram of semi-popular music, the
series will very likely carry the load
with a fairly alive step.
To suggest a program is too peril
ous an avocation. To mention
Strauss, Ravel, Tschaikowsky, Kor
sakoff, and maybe Gershwin, is, per
haps, permissable. Lighter and
noisier numbers from these com
posers will very likely save the
musical day at Stanford. Of course,
mighty conductors will not take
suggestions from college typewriter
athletes. No one expects them to—
least of all your reporter.
Of course, mighty conductors will
not shed tears over a much-beaten,
inert mass lying in the ash-heap
next year. And that inert mass will
be the Concert Series if too much
money is lost this year. Or maybe,
they just flatter our musical taste.

ferent in 20 negroes presenting such
a concert. There is a "punch"—in a
restrcted sense of the word.
A bustling manager capitalized
that "punch"; and the concert broke
even and may even make a shadow
of profit. That is startling news in

(his year of depression when more
vulgar types of amusement such as
football are gargling with red ink;
and choking to death on unpaid
bills. The Johnson singers are not
shoddy musical entertainment, but
they are lower on the scale than a
Wagnerian symphony recital. Let us
say simply that they have a more
general appeal.
The San Francisco Symphony is
the next number on the Concert
Series. They can make or break the
financial back of this institution. If
they load upon the much-beaten
back of the Concert Series great
doses of Bach, Beethoven, and Wag
ner, all is losl. The series will
crumble, and tumble into the red.
If they offer a well-diversified pro
gram of semi-popular music, the
series will very likely carry the load
with a fairly alive step.
To suggest a program is too peril
ous an avocation. To mention
Strauss, Ravel, Tschaikowsky, Kor
sakoff, and maybe Gershwin, is, per
haps, permissable. Lighter and
noisier numbers from these com
posers will very likely save the
musical day at Stanford. Of course,
mighty conductors will not take
suggestions from college typewriter
athletes. No one expects them to—
least of all your reporter.
Of course, mighty conductors will
not shed tears over a much-beaten,
inert mass lying in the ash-heap
next year. And that inert mass will
be the Concert Series if too much
money is lost this year. Or maybe,
they just flatter our musical taste.

It is the height of ill manners to
admit that you are right. It is in
dicative of an inflated ego, and a
deflated sense of propriety to calmly
state that your own opinions are
correct. However, we propose to do
just that thing. It will irritate those
that read and is supposed to irritate
those that write such stuff—but it
really doesn't.
Some time ago, when the Concert
Series first started to struggle, it
was here announced that the defi
cits would continue to grow until
popular artists with popular pro
grams were introduced. We felt that
the Campus was not overly-infested
with real music-lovers —keyed to
appreciate the so-called intellectual
music. As various managers have
sweated and prayed only to find red
ink all over their books at the end,
the truth of that sad idea has been
verified and re-verified.
It was somehow felt that at a uni
versity, the student ears should be
pitched to the beauty of the highest
types of music. Mounting deficits
completely disproved that notion.
The Hall Johnson choir the other
night proved that the Campus will
support a popular program. Espe
cially is this so when there is heart
appeal in the artists. There is some
thing mildly spectacular and dif
ferent in 20 negroes presenting such
a concert. There is a "punch"—in a
