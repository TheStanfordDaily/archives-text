BLESSED EVENT—(Warner Bros.) |
—At (he California Theatre, May- j
field.
:
The play whose plot was created I
in real life by Walter Winchell and j
Rudy Vallee, is a riotously success
ful movie.
Lee Tracy, as a wise-cracking I
Broadway columnist a la Winchell, j
is an extremely human and like- j
able fellow. The direction has al- '
lowed him to have human faults and ;
weaknesses in spite of the fact that j
he is the hero of the play.
The lines constitute probably the j
fastest-moving dialogue that has I
ever been written for a newspaper I
picture—and the narrative moves I
from one situation to another with
amazing x'apidity of tempo.
The gags are consistently funny, j
and are a ceaseless satire upon
Broadway columnists as a whole j
and upon Winchell and Winchell
methods particularly.
A great deal of valuable action I
was lost and the picture slowed ud
considerably when an actress pulled
a Frankie and Johnnie on the big- i
shot gangster who "done her wrong" j
—and other actors just recount the j
incident. The stage play has a scene j
of the actual shooting.
The same actress changes from
hysteria to angelic beatitude too j
quickly in a radio studio—but then, |
"playing the part" is essential — j
even in front of the "mike."

CRITICISM BY AUDITOR—With a
comment upon extemporaneous
theatricals.
1
American audiences are, for the I
most part, discreetly satisfied to ap- j
plaud the players after each cur
tain; Continental audiences are more
demonstrative. After the premiere
of "The Vortex" a London audience
stayed in the theatre long after the
performance to greet the author,
Noel Coward. Two years later, at
the premiere of "Sirocco"—Coward's
third play in a single year—an
audience booed, hissed, and went so
far in expression of its dislike as to
mob the author's car as he left the
; theatre.
"Sirocco" is not a good play, but
it is infinitely better than a great
deal of the current film product.
| That is why, when roughs loose
their raucous cheers upon ridicu
' lous and torrid scenes of passion
j played horizontally, I find little to
criticize in their counter-irritating
I exhibitionism.
They have surprised many a ma-
I tronly heart in the midst of vicari

j ous experience, and considerable
j tongue-lashing on the part of con- 1
I servative business men, whose own
j emotions were stirred by prolonged !
J lip-smackings.
But criticism-by-rough is not
j frequently unappreciative of really
I well-played drama. I have seen an i
| over-emotional Ruth Chatterton 1
| arouse guffaws, and c. smooth-play- 1
! ing Barrymore receive the tribute j
| of silence. Garbo usually plays to j
j quiet houses—except when com
| manded to be seduced. Jean Har
| low invariably finds deserved howls, j
I Probably the most enthusiastic |
I hooting of the season greeted the j
I cheap college drama, "The Age of j
Consent," but all of its good gags j
i hit well.
The local theatre-managers are to j
be commended for their happy taci- |
jturnity; it is indicative of an ap- ;
preciating humour-sense. After all, !
iif one may—and is expected—to j
! cheer fine acting it should be one's 1
| privilege to damn vulgarity or me- j
diocrity. —Sandoe
