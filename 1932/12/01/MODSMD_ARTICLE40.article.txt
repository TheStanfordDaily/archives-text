NO CHANCE
No dough—
No show.
No pants—
No dance.
No car—
Not far.
No ale—
No jail.
No girl—
No whirl.
Oh well-
No hell.
"Transportation for an ATTRAC
TIVE (sic) co-ed, to Lakeport, Cali
fornia. You don't need a Ford V-8.
The telephone number is Columbia
4096-W."—San Jose State Times.
Just a collar-ad man calling his
mate.
Gals had at floating
Shouldn't go boating.
"The most striking exhibit, from
the hiker's point of view, is an
'ultra-lightweight week-end kit,'
comprising rucksack, sleeping-bag,
tent, a four-peg coat-hanger, a
petrol stove, frypan, waterbucket, a
plate, a cup, receptacles for food and
drink, knife, spoon, and fork, and
electric torch, a pair of shoes, a tent
pole, swimming suit, complete
change of clothes, towels, soap, face
cloth, shaving tackle, and tooth
brush."—Manchester Guardian.
O-o-o-h, Roscoe, my back feels
as if I'd been strapped to a tent
pole!
"If you come to arrest our 4.000
scholars," retorted the nudist rector
of Berlin's biggest nudist school,
"They will follow you through the
streets of Berlin to jail, willingly
hut nude!"— Time Magazine.
The desk-sarg said.
As he flashed his star.
"My face is red,
But here we are."
