FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE WHO would like to see
;i championship Stanford team,
in anything from ping-pong to
checkers, Assistant Coach Nort
Thornton is going to parade the
pride and pleasure of the Farm
Saturday afternoon when he
trots out the 1933 editietaoinlao
Cardinal tank team.
With national champion Ted Wiget
nursing a swell case of the flu,
Thornton will be forced to start
three sophomores at forward, when
the varsity water polo team clashes
with the alumni at 2:30 o'clock.
Triolo, Benet, and Hirsch are a
forward wall that almost any coach
would be proud to have around,
however, and behind them will be
Graves, Taranik, and Kinkead at
guards, and Captain Burke Knapp j
alternating at goal with Leo Cook.
When you have an All-Coast
player for goalie, and then you have
a man almost good enough to dis- j
place him, you are l ight in the way
of becoming the coach of a winning
team.
But against this startling array of
varsity talent will be some of the
best swimmers on the coast. And if
experience counts for anything the
varsity should take it on the chin.
At forwards the grads will
have Austin Clapp and Frank
Booth of the latest Olympic
team, and at sprint forward and
goal guard will be two members
of the Olympic outfit, Aus
tin and Collett.
The guards who will protect
Goalie Collett will be Ward
Woods, Whitey Burns, and Og
deii Driggs. Woods is from last
year's septet. Burns played two
years ago and was one of the
greatest defensive players de
veloped at Stanford. Driggs
played at the same time Burns
held forth, and he is an experi
enced club player besides.
In addition to the Card water polo
team, Thornton will have the five
varsity divers performing singly
and in chorus.
So if you want to see what a J
winning team looks like, drop j
around to Encina Pools Saturday
afternoon and watch the Stanford I
mermen. Aside from the swimming j
that goes on, there is an opportunity j
for the Cardinal women to see what i
real swimming pools look like, or
do I mean . . .
IT IS CERTAINLY A FINE
STATE OF AFFAIRS when the ;
betting boys up town can start
singing the blues about an In- j
dian basketball team a month
before the schedule is due to
get under way.
Here it is December 1, and they i
already are wagering that Stanford j
won't take a conference contcst. j
After last year's swell record it is a |
pleasure to contemplate another fine I
season. Ha! Ha!
Last season the Cards were all I
set to put a real quintet on the floor I
at the end of the football season, \
end without exception the boys j
failed to show up when casaba j
practice began.
What we want to know is: where i
do all the good basketball men go, j
and why in hades can't we even ;
hang on to the ones we have?
We have a swell coach, a good i
pavilion (well, good enough any- j
how), and no team.
What a life! —Bob Wade j

already are wagering that Stanford j
won't take a conference contcst. j
After last year's swell record it is a |
pleasure to contemplate another fine I
season. Ha! Ha!
Last season the Cards were all I
set to put a real quintet on the floor I
at the end of the football season, \
end without exception the boys j
failed to show up when casaba j
practice began.
What we want to know is: where i
do all the good basketball men go, j
and why in hades can't we even ;
hang on to the ones we have?
We have a swell coach, a good i
pavilion (well, good enough any- j
how), and no team.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
THOSE WHO would like to see
;i championship Stanford team,
in anything from ping-pong to
checkers, Assistant Coach Nort
Thornton is going to parade the
pride and pleasure of the Farm
Saturday afternoon when he
trots out the 1933 editietaoinlao
Cardinal tank team.
With national champion Ted Wiget
nursing a swell case of the flu,
Thornton will be forced to start
three sophomores at forward, when
the varsity water polo team clashes
with the alumni at 2:30 o'clock.
Triolo, Benet, and Hirsch are a
forward wall that almost any coach
would be proud to have around,
however, and behind them will be
Graves, Taranik, and Kinkead at
guards, and Captain Burke Knapp j
alternating at goal with Leo Cook.
When you have an All-Coast
player for goalie, and then you have
a man almost good enough to dis- j
place him, you are l ight in the way
of becoming the coach of a winning
team.
But against this startling array of
varsity talent will be some of the
best swimmers on the coast. And if
experience counts for anything the
varsity should take it on the chin.
At forwards the grads will
have Austin Clapp and Frank
Booth of the latest Olympic
team, and at sprint forward and
goal guard will be two members
of the Olympic outfit, Aus
tin and Collett.
The guards who will protect
Goalie Collett will be Ward
Woods, Whitey Burns, and Og
deii Driggs. Woods is from last
year's septet. Burns played two
years ago and was one of the
greatest defensive players de
veloped at Stanford. Driggs
played at the same time Burns
held forth, and he is an experi
enced club player besides.
In addition to the Card water polo
team, Thornton will have the five
varsity divers performing singly
and in chorus.
So if you want to see what a J
winning team looks like, drop j
around to Encina Pools Saturday
afternoon and watch the Stanford I
mermen. Aside from the swimming j
that goes on, there is an opportunity j
for the Cardinal women to see what i
real swimming pools look like, or
do I mean . . .
IT IS CERTAINLY A FINE
STATE OF AFFAIRS when the ;
betting boys up town can start
singing the blues about an In- j
dian basketball team a month
before the schedule is due to
get under way.
Here it is December 1, and they i
already are wagering that Stanford j
won't take a conference contcst. j
