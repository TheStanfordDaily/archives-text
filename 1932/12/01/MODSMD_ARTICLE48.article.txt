# DROFNATS NAMES LOCAL SHOTS ON ALL-COAST GRID SELECTIONS
## 
### 
Milpitas, December I—Utterly
discouraged from his failure to col- I
lect dough from members of the |
local high school's 130-pound team, j
Professor Johnny Drofnats dictated j
his All-Coast football team for 1932. !
At an early hour this morning it !
appeared the All-Coast team would
be a financial flop, but at 3.01 o'clock I
it was learned that the Pi Phis and I
Chi Psis had collected enough coin j
to give Marion Hewlett a guard post j
on the fourth team.
