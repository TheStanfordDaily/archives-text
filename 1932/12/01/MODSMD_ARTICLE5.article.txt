# "GHOSTS" TO BE HEARD TONIGHT
## Helvenston Makes Campus Debut As Actor 
### James Sandoe 
Tonight Sword and Sandals pre
sents, as its second reading of the
fall quarter, Hendrik Ibsen's
"Ghosts." The reading is to be given
in the Little Theatre and will begin
promptly at 7:30 o'clock.
In the cast are Dr. Margery Bailey
: as Mrs. Alving, and Harold Helven
j ston, Director of Dramatics, who
i makes his campus debut as an actor
j with this performance; he is to read
i the 3tole of Oswald Alving.
Cathcart to Appear
Robert Cathcart, who has ap
peared in several readings and
whose outstanding characterization
on the Stanford stage is probably
that of the Nameless Man in "Gran
ite," will be Engstrand. A. Grove
Day, who will soon be seen as
! Markheim in the English Club movie
i from Robert Louis Stevenson's tale,
j and who appeared in many campus
| productions under Gordon Davis,
will be the fatuous, if sincere, Pas
tor Manders.
Josephine Filcher has been se
lected to read the part of Regina
i Engstrand. Her appearances hither- :
|to have been confined chiefly to>
I one-act plays, notably O'Neill's j
! "Dreamy Kid," produced by the !
j acting class last fall. Vallejo Gant- j
ner will read stage directions.
| Ibsen's play was one of the early j
j "realistic" dramas, a problem play i
i which found great favor with audi- I
ences throughout the world and!
equally high disapproval from vari- !
ous outraged censorial powers.
Ibsen's Play Banned
In England. George Bernard Shaw :
I was Ibsen's most powerful defender; !
j but for a time even his pen could |
I not rescue Ibsen's drama for play- j
! goers. Shaw himself was, soon after, |
! under ban for "Mrs. Warren's Pro- j
j fession."
"Ghosts" presents the problem of
j a woman who has lived with a dis
j solute and diseased husband because
j convention would not permit her to
j leave him. A duplication of the
father in his son seems imminent.
I Mis. Alving struggles against trag- j
I edy but cannot avert the final j
' catastrophe.
The play is one of the greater j
! modern tragedies; it has not aged!
|as realistic plays are likely to do.
I The reading should be a high point j
| in the activities of Sword and San- j
1 dais.
