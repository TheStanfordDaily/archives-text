# WIGET CONTRACTS FLU; WILL BE OUT OF ALUMNI GAME
## Grads Favored In Water Polo Battle; Race To Be Featured 
### Willard Bungay 
Coach Nort Thornton's varsity
I water polo team suffered a severe
j loss yesterday when it was dis-
I covered that Ted Wiget, star sprint
i forward and the most outstanding
j member of the septet, will be lost
I for Saturday's game with the all
| star alumni team.
Wiget has contracted influenza and
there is little chance that he will be
recovered sufficiently to play Sat
: urday. Dick Hirsch has been shifted
; from his regular guard position to
i play Wiget's position.
Comparing the two teams on a
| man-for-man basis, the alumni
j team, since the loss of Wiget by the
; varsity, has a stronger man for
| every position and will be heavily
J favored to win.
Grad Forwards Best
In the forward department, Aus-
I tin Clapp and Frank Booth easily
outclass Thornton's two sophomores,
Jimmy Triolo and Jim Benet. Both
of the alumni players were on this
i year's American Olympic team and
are much faster and trickier in
, handling the ball than Triolo and
I Benet.
At sprint forward, Ginger Austin, I
who played for the United States j
| in the 1924 Olympic Games, will be |
! pitted against another sophomore, j
Dick Hirsch. Hirsch will only have i
] three days' practice at this position, j
I which fact will undoubtedly be a I
I great handicap in such an import- !
j ant post.
Burns Strong Guard
Whitey Burns, who captained
Stanford's Junior National A.A.U.
| champions in 1931, is considered one
| of the best defensive guards on the
| Pacific Coast and should outplay
| Don Kinkead, as should either Og
l den Driggs or Wandy Bramel out
| class Vlad Taranik, sophomore.
Gordy Graves, of the varsity, :
! should be about equal to Ward !
Woods in offense and is probably in j
| better condition. However, Woods is j
j a great defensive player and will j
j make the going plenty tough.
| Elmer Col let t, one of the greatest !
goal guards on the Pacific Coast and '
member of the 1924 American I
Olympic Team, will have his hands j
full competing against Captain j
Burke Knapp or Leo Cook, who j
have both been playing sensationally j
in practice.
Coach Thornton desires to em- j
phasize the fact that admission is J
free and women are invited. The j
show starts at 2:30 o'clock Saturday j
I afternoon in Encina pools. i
