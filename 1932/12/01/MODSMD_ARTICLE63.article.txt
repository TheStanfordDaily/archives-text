# EARLY CHRISTMAS MAILING ASKED

Amateur Santa Clauses who want
tc be sure that the foreign sweetie
gets his or her present before
Christmas, had better do their shop
ping early, according to A. H.
Wheeler, Superintendent of the
Stanford Postoffice.
If you are remembering someone
in Germany, Italy, France, Denmark
or England, you must get the pack
ages in the mail before December
11 at the latest. Japanese friends
won't get their gifts if they are not
in the postoffice before December 10.
And the girl in Old China will think
she's forgotten if Uncle Sam doesn't
get your mail by December 3.
Red Cross seals or Christmas
stamps on the front of a foreign
bound letter are not permitted,
Wheeler said. The mail will be con
fiscated or returned. Packages with
out sufficient postage will meet the
same fate.
The Stanford campus has a steady
mailing list in France, Germany,
England, and Japan, according io
Wheeler. Not only is the outgoing
mail to these sections heavy during
the Christmas season, but a steady
flow of incoming mail is handled
each day.
