lOWA CITY, la., Nov. 30 (JP)â€”
Strong backs, shovels, coal and a j
furnace are laboratory requirements I
for two new courses at the Univer- j
sity of lowa.
Residents who employ university j
students have complained that the \
youths know little of furnace tech
nique. As evidence they point to
chimneys belching black smoke.
So President Walter A. Jessup has
announced courses in anatomy and :
digestion of the furnace, with prac
tical demonstrations in the Kellogg |
dormitory boiler room.
