# Bradshaw To Cut Hoop Squad Of 60 Next Week
## 
### 
Coach "Rabbit" Bradshaw got his
first glimpse of his freshman bas
ketball squad yesterday when he
watched the first-string men in
scrimmage after getting his breath
from his train ride from Pittsburgh.
Bradshaw expressed the opinion
that he would be better able to
judge the relative strength of the
squad after the first of the week at
which time the first cut would be
made from the squad of 60. No in
dication at this time could be pos
sible as Varsity Coach John Bunn
has been handling the freshmen
while Bradshaw has been with the
football squad.
Brazil's coffee exports this year
are expected to equal the average
for the last several years.
