# QUINN DEFEATS WALDO MUNDAY IN FAST MATCH
## Five Of Seven Final Bouts Stopped By Referee; Two Decisions 
### Jack Beach 
Close to a thousand boxing fans
witnessed one of the best boxing
programs ever held on the Stanford
campus when the finals and semi
finals of the University novice box
ing tournament were fought last
night in the Pavilion.
The bouts resulted in five tech
nical knockouts and two decisions,
with Waldo Munday and Bob Quinn
putting on the best fight of the eve
ning. Quinn upset the dope bucket
by defeating the highly touted Mun
day and won a close decision over
his more-experienced opponent.
Both fighters started fast with Mun
day having a slight edge in the first
I'ound. Quinn picked up points in
Ihe second and held his lead during
the last frame.
Stephens Wins
Stuart Stephens, lightweight bat
tler, who won over Hayden Hender
son by a technical knockout in the
first round, and Keith Topping who
defeated Bob Ransom in the first
round, completely outclassed their
opponents and won handily. Topping
scored a thirty-second technical
knockout in the preliminaries and
looked to be the best fighter on last
night's card.
Ed Johnson and Modi Bagai
staged a good fight with both men
slugging hard in the first round, but
Bagai slowed up a bit in the second
canto and Johnson put over a win
ning punch and scored a technical
knockout.
Middleweight Close
A very even bout resulted in the
middleweight division between
Johnny Fowler and Thornton Hin
man. They opened cautiously but
speeded up in the second round and
then slowed down again in the third.
The judges gave the decision to
Fowler but the fight could have
been called either way.
The final in the heavyweight class
was won by Phil Johnston, varsity
grid player, when he scored a tech
nical knockout over Axel Nyeland
in the second round. Johnson out
weighed his opponent by almost 50
pounds and put all his weight be
hind a right to the jaw that knocked
Nyeland out.
Schall Performs
During the intermission ihe fans
were given a real show by Myron
Schall, Stanford boxing instructor,
who gave an exhibition of striking
the bag. Schall hit the bag with
everything but his feet and demon
strated his ability by punching it
blindfolded. He wound up his ex
hibition with a side act of rope
skipping and tap-danced while
jumping rope.
G. Darwin Reavy and Company,
professional tumblers, amused the
spectators during this period with
several acrobatic stunts.
Ernie Caddel acted as announcer
for the evening's events.
