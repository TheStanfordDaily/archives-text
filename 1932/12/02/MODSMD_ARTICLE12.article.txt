# "Ghosts" Holds Audience Tense In Fine Reading
## Dr. Bailey Takes Honors In Role Of Mrs. Alving 
### 
A further comment upon the
play will appear later in the
Reviewer. The reading deserves
a more considered attention.
Last night's reading of "Ghosts,"
the hlost serious play which Sword
and Sandals has thus far attempted,
was triumphant. The tragedy, which
has not lost any of its power in
more than a quarter of a century,
held tense an audience which filled
the Little Theatre.
Acting honors belong primarily to
Dr. Margery Bailey, a fine Mrs.
Alving, Harold Helvenston, whose
debut as an actor here was marked
ly successful, and A. Grove Day,
who properly made Pastor Manders
an infinitely fatuous and blind fool.
The other players, with less to do,
were almost equally important: Rob
ert Cathcart's Engstrand, sly and
hypocritical, was excellently sus
tained, and Josephine Filcher was
good in her one real scene.
