## 
### COLLIER CONNELL 
Reporter's Note: With the sports pones boastinif all-. Imerieaii, all-Coast,
mid all-l)rofnats varsities these cloys, Stanford's "5(A)" takes lime out from
the Carnival to name an all-500 "Dream Team."

COLVIN—CAPTAIN, because he [
is the most delectable of them all. i
Damp, dark curls above an artist's j
model's face, topping a body of i
rangy and appealing grace.
DUSTY ALLEN — VICE-CAP- j
TAIN, because of his delightful wide
mouth, his flashy use of it, and his j
altogether mischievous mug, plus a I
look of superb health.
CADDEL—A rotagravure in blond.
Throatsome throat, straight, sym
metrical face, proportionate legs and j
limbs. Blond harmony.
CORBUS —Because of his amusing
pink-and-white Campbell Soup
face, belied by his sober brows, I
drawn together over the seriousness i
of being prexy.
TARGHETTA — The self-publi
cizing red hair which surmounts his |
singular face.
SIM —Picturesquely a tough. A
mean ash blond, with the most ef- j
fective lnntem jaw that ever talked
to Pop Warner.

I BATES—Because he has the wist-
I ful close-up in the Big Game sou
| venir program. His face suggests the
i lined face of a slim, hard-riding
1 jockey, looking the way Earle Sande
j sounds.
DOUB—lnexplicable in type, or
j any other way. For the women, a
I magic hokus-pokus to which no
I other man has the clue. Also gives
j the dashing impression of wearing
I cowpuncher boots, when he is not.
EDDIE STRONG—On the Gray
| team. But he owns a varsity laugh.
VAN DELLEN—Creditably quiet,
i an engaging smile, and the sports
! writer sare fond of him.
MOSCRIPT—Going in for Caddel.
He is alleged to look like Clark
' Gable.
JACK HILLMAN—A well-tail-
I ored chunk, exceptionally smooth in
topcoat end Mallory felt, stepping
| off a train.
COACH ERNIE NEVERS—Screens
i well.
