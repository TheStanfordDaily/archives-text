(Ed it or in I)
Justice made its debut into Stanford interfraternity circles
yesterday afternoon milli the announcement by the Interfra
ternity Hoard of Control that Delta ('hi will be deprived of
rushiny and pledging privileges for the period of one year. \
One freshman, found guilty on the same charge, was given
an identical penalty.
A long-felt need of the campus has been gratified. Already
having distinguished itself by enacting the most sensible and
practicable rushing rules in Stanford's interfraternity history. I
the Hoard of (loutrot demonstrated yesterday that it is an |
executive body with the sincerity and courage to back up its !
threats and promises.
The offending house and the freshman were given a fair 1
trial, and they were found to be guilty. The lioard saw its !
duty ami fulfilled it. The Hoard's action in imposing the one- j
year penalty is particularly laudable in view of the fact that j
the violation was not so flagrant as many which have occurred \
in former years. 'The guilt of both Delta Chi and the fresh- j
man is undoubted, but the offense does not so definitely violate j
the spirit of deferred rushing rules as have the pre-arranged
parties for entire houses and several rushees of the past all \
the more credit to the Hoard of Control.
_'
Present rushing and pledging rules, with their fewer bans j
and greater liberties for both fraternities and freshmen, are I
working as rushing rules have never worked before. It is the j
honest belief of the Hoard of Control and the Daily that de- !
liberate, pre-arranged illegal rushing has reached a new low j
during the past quarter. Delta Chi a/forded an exception to \
this general situation and suffered lite consequences.
Wind some houses and some freshmen may have con
sidered the Hoard's "bluff" has been called, and it wasn't a j
bluff after all. The Interfraternity Hoard of Control has shown j
its hand, with its telltale ace, and has served warning to all I
How and Encina men who still may wish to gamble with j
justice.
