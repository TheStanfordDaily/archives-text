# DEBT MENACING WORLD-BRITISH

LONDON, Dec. 1 (/P)—Resump- |
tion of debt payments as they were j
before the British moratorium I
"would inevitably deepen the de- j
pression and would lead to further ;
falls in commodity prices, with dis- j
astrous consequences from which j
no nation would be exempt," the j
British government said in its new i
war debt note delivered in Wash- j
ington today.
The note asserted that if the debt i
payments were resumed it would be |
necessary for Britain to strengthen j
her exchange position "by reduction ;
of the very heavy adverse balance I
of trade between the United King- j
dom and the United States of j
America, which amounted to!
£78,000,000 (currently about $250,- 1
000,000) in 1931."
No "Impossible" Citation
The communication did not state j
whether, in the event Washington >
refused to suspend the $95,550,000 j
instalment due December 15, the j
government would pay or refuse to |
pay. The inference that it would pay j
might be drawn from the fact that I
difficulties in the way of the vari- j
ous forms of payment were ex- j
pounded. There was no statement i
that it was impossible to pay.
