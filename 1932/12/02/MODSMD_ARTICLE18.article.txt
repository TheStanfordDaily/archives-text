# QUAD PHOTOS
## 
### 
It's a long way to Berkeley
for the 35 seniors who have
not yet been photographed for
the Quad. Beyond the deadline
of 4 o'clock today, seniors who
wish to fill their privileged
half-inch square in the 1932
Quad, will have to go to the
Watson studio across the bay
in Berkeley.
Up to this time, a last fleet
ing opportunity is offered re
calcitrant seniors at the Quad-
Watson campus studio at 520
Salvatierra.
The Quad further announces
that several lucky persons will
get their $6 Quads for ten cents
at the Quad Carnival booth in
the Pavilion Saturday night.
