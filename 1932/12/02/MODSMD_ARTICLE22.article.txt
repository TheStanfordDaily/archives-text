# DELTA CHI'S FORFEIT RUSH PRIVILEGES FOR ILLEGAL PARTY
## Interfraternity Board Inflicts One Year Ban On Row Group, 1 Frosh Penalty Will Not Apply lo Pledging Of Juniors, Livermore Says ONE DISSENTING VOTE Second House Investigated On Violation Count 
### 
The Interfraternity Board of Con
| trol yesterday put teeth into I lie
I new rushing rules for the first time
(this year by depriving the Delia
j Chi's of rushing lower division men
| for one year. The freshman impli
j cated was forbidden to pledge any
| house for the same period.
The illegal party took place on
j Saturday night, November 12, after
I the final dinner date of the second
! fall quarter rushing period. Al
! though dinner dates are supposed to
j be over at 8 o'clock, the freshman
j who was penalized was asked to
j join a party of four members of the
I Delta Chi house to attend a moving
I picture in San Francisco. The group
I left the campus about 7:30 and're
j turned at 11:30 o'clock.
Friends of Freshman
In the party were the Delta Chi
j rushing chairman and his brother,
I old friends of the freshman, and
I two other members of the fraternity
i who were not acquainted with the
J man who was being rushed.
When he was called before the
! Board to testify in the case, the
i president of the house, although he
j asked for no leniency except in the
j case of the freshman, absolutely de
nied that he or any other Delta
i Chi, excluding the four implicated
| in the charge, knew anything about
I the party. His testimony stated that
the house was not behind the actions
of the rushing chairman in this case
in any respcet.
Sponsor Reports Case
The Board was informed of the
I party through a chance statement of
the freshman to a group of his
friends Â«in Encina, which was over
heard by a sponsor.
Action of the Board was almost
unanimous, there being only one
dissenting vote on the penalty. One
member of the Board was absent in
Los Angeles, but it was definitely
known that he was in favor of a
maximum penalty in such cases.
The Board in inflicting the penalty
made the proviso that the frater
nity would not be prevented from
pledging junior transfers, the ban
applying only to members of the
class of 1936.
No Attempt At Alibi
Ike Livermore, chairman of the
Board, said after the meeting last
night that the attitude of the house
and the freshman, both of whom
seemed to desire lhat all the cir
cumstances of the situation be
known with no effort to give an alibi,
made it difficult to mete out so
severe a penalty.
One other case of illegal rushing
is before the Board of Control in
| which one member of a house has
been reported as doing some illegal
rushing. All information has been
obtained through friends of the
freshman involved, while members
| of the fraternity deny absolutely
j any knowledge of the matter. The
Board so far has been unable to lo
cate the freshman. Livermore states
that every effort possible is being
i made to gather information on the
J ease in order to clear up the situation.
