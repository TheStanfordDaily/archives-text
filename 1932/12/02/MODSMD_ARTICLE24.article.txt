# GOOD TIME IN GOOD CAUSE
## 
### 
The Pavilion will be transformed into a miniature
Coney Island tomorrow night when the Five Hundred put
on their fifth annual carnival.
Through the general uproar of realistic circus atmo
sphere will sound raucous cries of hallyhooers, advertis
ing their wares in professional side-show style.
Some will exhort roughs to hear their fortunes from
the lips of beautiful and mysterious women. Others will
offer tests of strength and skill, with ample rewards for the
ablest. Each will ask as a fee the paltry sum of one thin
dime, but a tenth of a dollar.
The fun will be there, just as it was last year, and the
year before. But tonight's festival will hold more than a
rousing good time for all. Every dime laid on the line will
go for a worthy cause, into the coffers of the student emer
gency fund committee.
A.W.S. is expending tremendous efforts into putting on
the show. Yet it is giving up the fruits of this work, regu
larly utilized to help pay for the women's gym. The Board
of Athletic Control is offering use of the Pavilion at cost;
the Mothers' Club, Boble Club, and the sororities are con
tributing home-made candy; and the corporation yard is
donating equipment.
Think twice before you wander off-campus on a date
tonight. By dropping into the Pavilion and scattering a few
dimes — far less than you would spend elsewhere — you can
enjoy that self-satisfying "I have helped" feeling and with
it a wagon load of fun.
