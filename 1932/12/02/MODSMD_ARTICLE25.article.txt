# CASEY AT THE BAT
## 
### 
Back in 1895 several colleges in the East felt that there
was no longer any demand for their baseball teams. The
cry had gone up that the undergraduates were not inter
ested in the sport. Three years later, the history books tell
us, every one of these colleges were once more enthusiastic
fans.
In a recent report from Ohio University it was slated
that, because of financial straits, baseball would be rele
gated to an intramural basis. The wolves began to howl,
the vultures began to circle over the prospective corpse of
intercollegiate baseball.
Ollicial figures from the B.A.C. make it seem as though
there was little baseball depression at Stanford. Close to
Â«S0 men are signed up for fall baseball practice. This is the
largest turnout ever recorded for an off-season session.
The real dyed-in-the-wool fan needs no urging to come
out when the crack of the willow begins to be heard. The
doubters, and other unfortunates, who are not steeped in
lns( year's batting averages, should buy themselves a bag
of peanuts, take off their coats, and just holler. It doesn't
make any difference why- just yell, and the first thing you
know another ball fan is born.
