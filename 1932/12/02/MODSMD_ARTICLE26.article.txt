Tf yon ever get a fine idea von want to let 1 lie world in
on, and vou need a good publicity agent to put il over for |
you, the place to go is not to the Los Angeles Chamber of i
Commerce, strangclv enough, but to the Univcrsitv of I
Washington campus.
Ask for any dance chairman. You will undoubtedly be
introduced to one of the fastest thinking publicity hounds
in existence. And he will get results, just the way he per- j
snades Hnskv shufflers to lay out dough for tickets every I
time he tries.
He has pulled many swell stunts in the past. He has
even had himself kidnapped and ducked in icy Lake Wash
ington the day before the dance. Hut his latest, pulled last
week for the Varsity ball in Seattle, was much smarter and'
more subtle, and a great deal less wearing on the person.
At the last minute, just at the right time to whip the bid
sale into top speed, he had the Graduate Manager and all
the authorities hurl charges of "Graft!" at him with such'
force that he simply had to resign, not forgetting, however,
to gracefully and publicly plead for the success of the
dance "in spite of it all."
And the splendid part of if all is that the Washington I
campus believed it, every word.
