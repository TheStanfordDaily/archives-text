# BULL SESSION
## CAVORT AT THE CARNIVAL 
### 
Charity is a horrid word but it's |
worse at the end of your college !
education. In the midst of Plato. ■
Warner, Aristotle, and Dink Tem
pleton it is annoying to think that I
there are some students who miss
meals for reasons other than the .
lash of excess calories. It's sad— !
very sad—but isn't the truth always j
sad? Yes, it is sad. It is sad.
But something must be done j
about it. And the women—the god
mothers of all charity—are at hand
to do something. There are many |
ways to extract money for worth
while enterprises. The most annoy- j
ing system is a heart-to-heart talk ,
on the "terrible need" and "terrible 1
lack of funds" and the "terrible re- j
suits" if nothing is done. That sys- ]
tem is sometimes necessary.
Personally, I like the painless
method—the way that gives one all ,
that glorious moral exaltation of 1
doing good and yet with none of
the annoying pains that attend j
parting with needed dimes. How to |
do it is the question. The "500"
have lisped their pretty answer with
the Carnival in the Basketball Pa
vilion tomorrow night from 7:30
o'clock to the witching hour.
The "500" is behind the thing and
that by the very nature of things i
assures its success. In addition, all j
the people of note and authority |
are sweating to put the thing over— j

I and so we thought we had better
! climb on the Carnival-wagon before
| it was too late to become respect
! able. Everyone goes—Boathouse and
i Sequoia—impoverished hasher and
i freshman nugget.
( The most sophisticated thing to
do these days is to be unsophisti
cated. The Carnival is just one
! round of unrestrained plebeian sport.
| And remember at all times, that
| while you are dripping ice cream
j bricks on your cords, you are help
j ing somebody. Charity affairs usu
; ally have that moral crepe hanging
; over (hem. Not so witn the Carnival.
The women get so much fun fly—
| ing around arranging things for the
] Carnival that they forget it as a
; charitable enterprise and really put
j on a lively show. And then it is ad
ditional sport to let dimes slip out
| of your pockets when the place is
! infested with coy young ladies
ready to inveigle any bit of the
| realm's coin from unwary roughs.
And if we must appeal to your
carnal instincts, we will for char
j ity's sake. at the Car
nival when you dance with lovely
creatures for ten cents, one thin
dime. Think of it—the Campus
Queens at your beck and call for
one-tenth of a dollar. Where is your
j sense of power, men? Come to the
Carnival tomorrow night.
