•THE CONQUERORS" (Radio)—At I
the Varsity Theatre.
Though lacking in the epic sweep
of "Cimarron," after which it is ob
viously patterned, "The Conquerors"
nevertheless achieves a place with
the finest of pioneer stories. It is a
film of climaxes, emotional and !
physical, marked by the virile di- '
rection of William Wellman.
The story is an episodic one which j
covers three generations of a 1
pioneer family, depicting how each I
is assailed by a panic; but each time \
these hardy trail-blazers recover:
and start anew. It concludes with j
the fine thought toward which the
whole film points; that America, de- j
spite depressions, will carry on, so '
long as the pioneer spirit remains, j
Like many three-generation pic- j
tures, this is dominated in the latter j
scenes by the make-up man, who !
in this case achieves happier re- i
suits than usual; Ann Harding's j
make-up is highly convincing.
Miss Harding has weathered many j
cinema storms of late, and though !
this film is a more worthy opus, one i
still does not find the Ann Harding j
who so delighted in "Holiday." Miss ;
Harding's perfoi'mance in this is a i
beautiful piece of work, and her
magnificent, voice is as compelling ;
as ever. In the earlier sequences j
especially she is at "her best; give,
her a piume, a chignon, and the I
sweep of a satin skirt, and there is j
no one like her, as she proved in
"East Lynne."
Richard Dix is again the pioneer
husband, and turns in a splendidly j
sustained performance, almost as
convincing as his Yancey Cravat. I
The most genuine characters are 1
those portrayed by Guy Kibbee and I
Edna May Oliver, the former with 1
a delicate mingling of comedy and
I pathos, and the latter with her
splendid comedy better l-estrained
than usual. —Chapin |
SHERLOCK HOLMES (Fox)—At
the Stanford Theatre.
| Sherlock Holmes on the screen is j
very nearly as entertaining a figure 1
; as he was in the adventures as !
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote them.
Taciturn Clive Brook makes an ex- j
cellent, urbane, immobile protago
nist.
The film, while it recaptures the
air of Doyle'% tales, is not as meti
culous as they in explanation of
Holmes' deductions, particularly as
to the more important plot-inci
dents.
Good melodrama, well-played,
with quietly satiric moments at the
expense of American gun methods,
the picture is an evening's enter
tainment for anyone.
The director has been a little over
impressionistic in several scenes,
particularly the opening sequences

I and introduction of minor charac
ters. In imitation of what is known
as the German photographic style
| he sacrificed clarity lor unsuccessful
I aesthetics. Further, a fox hunt,
I neither symbolistic nor contributing
I to the plot, is given too much at
! tention. But these are minor faults
in a good film.
The picture moves along at a lei
j surely pace, particularly in the
I comic scenes, which indeed might
| have been speeded to some advan
! tage. The humor is quiet; one of the
: best bits is Holmes,"disguised as an
j old woman, smoking his curved
j pipe. —Sandoe

j To replace the showing of Johan
! Hagemeyer's excellent camera por
j traits in the Stanford Gallery, Pedro
j Lemos' has hung some photographs
| by Dr. Carl G. Wilson of Palo Alto
| in what he promises will be a series
iof photography exhibitions. It is
| unfortunate, perhaps, that Dr. Wil-
I son's amateur work was not hung
j first, so that as a follow-up to Hage
-1 meyer's it would not suffer by com
; parison. Dr. Wilson has made a
long, repetitious, conventionalized
I camera record of what must have
! been a very beautiful trip through
| the High Sierras, but the pattern
} of his photographs is negligible and
| trite, lacking any of the conscious
i imaginative building in mass and
I form so powerfully caught by Hage
! meyer in still life as well as in por
j traits.
Another Carmel artist, Philip
I Nesbitt, replaces Burton S. Boun
\ dey's exhibit of Carmel landscapes
with a group of his Tahiti sketches
and drawings for children. Nesbitt's
pictures of Tahiti have no relation
. to Gauguin's. Their interpretation is
I superficial, transient, devoid of

depth and understanding—the sort
of watercolors Matisse might fill his
notebook with so as to remember
how the natives sat and dressed and
ate. The appeal of this work is in
its pictorial clarity, its balance, and
its reminiscence for the traveler. As
art it lacks profundity and variety.
A much less pleasing, less stylized,
more hackneyed travel record than
Nesbitt's occupies the main room
of the gallery. The paintings Adolph
Berson has made of European door
ways, cathedrals, and fishing boats
are nondescript and banal. He does
not even reproduce architecture
with solidity or form, and the mono
tony of his still life oils—both in
lighting and composition—is amaz
ing. Only a Paris street scene in an
inhibited and Victorianesque Utril
lo manner is faintly satisfying.

with a group of his Tahiti sketches

I superficial, transient, devoid of

its pictorial clarity, its balance, and
its reminiscence for the traveler. As

A much less pleasing, less stylized,

not even reproduce architecture

•THE CONQUERORS" (Radio)—At I
the Varsity Theatre.
Though lacking in the epic sweep
of "Cimarron," after which it is ob
viously patterned, "The Conquerors"
nevertheless achieves a place with
the finest of pioneer stories. It is a
film of climaxes, emotional and !
physical, marked by the virile di- '
rection of William Wellman.
The story is an episodic one which j
covers three generations of a 1
pioneer family, depicting how each I
is assailed by a panic; but each time \
these hardy trail-blazers recover:
and start anew. It concludes with j
the fine thought toward which the
whole film points; that America, de- j
spite depressions, will carry on, so '
long as the pioneer spirit remains, j
Like many three-generation pic- j
tures, this is dominated in the latter j
scenes by the make-up man, who !
in this case achieves happier re- i
suits than usual; Ann Harding's j
make-up is highly convincing.
Miss Harding has weathered many j
cinema storms of late, and though !
this film is a more worthy opus, one i
still does not find the Ann Harding j
who so delighted in "Holiday." Miss ;
Harding's perfoi'mance in this is a i
beautiful piece of work, and her
magnificent, voice is as compelling ;
as ever. In the earlier sequences j
especially she is at "her best; give,
her a piume, a chignon, and the I
sweep of a satin skirt, and there is j
no one like her, as she proved in
"East Lynne."
Richard Dix is again the pioneer
husband, and turns in a splendidly j
sustained performance, almost as
convincing as his Yancey Cravat. I
The most genuine characters are 1

Good melodrama, well-played,

j To replace the showing of Johan
! Hagemeyer's excellent camera por
j traits in the Stanford Gallery, Pedro
j Lemos' has hung some photographs
| by Dr. Carl G. Wilson of Palo Alto
| in what he promises will be a series
iof photography exhibitions. It is
| unfortunate, perhaps, that Dr. Wil-
I son's amateur work was not hung
j first, so that as a follow-up to Hage
-1 meyer's it would not suffer by com
; parison. Dr. Wilson has made a
long, repetitious, conventionalized
I camera record of what must have
! been a very beautiful trip through
| the High Sierras, but the pattern
} of his photographs is negligible and
| trite, lacking any of the conscious
i imaginative building in mass and
I form so powerfully caught by Hage
! meyer in still life as well as in por
j traits.
Another Carmel artist, Philip
I Nesbitt, replaces Burton S. Boun
\ dey's exhibit of Carmel landscapes
with a group of his Tahiti sketches
and drawings for children. Nesbitt's
pictures of Tahiti have no relation
. to Gauguin's. Their interpretation is
I superficial, transient, devoid of

depth and understanding—the sort
of watercolors Matisse might fill his
notebook with so as to remember
how the natives sat and dressed and
ate. The appeal of this work is in
its pictorial clarity, its balance, and
its reminiscence for the traveler. As
art it lacks profundity and variety.
A much less pleasing, less stylized,
more hackneyed travel record than
Nesbitt's occupies the main room
of the gallery. The paintings Adolph
Berson has made of European door
ways, cathedrals, and fishing boats
are nondescript and banal. He does
not even reproduce architecture
with solidity or form, and the mono
tony of his still life oils—both in
lighting and composition—is amaz
ing. Only a Paris street scene in an
inhibited and Victorianesque Utril
lo manner is faintly satisfying.

•THE CONQUERORS" (Radio)—At I
the Varsity Theatre.
Though lacking in the epic sweep
of "Cimarron," after which it is ob
viously patterned, "The Conquerors"
nevertheless achieves a place with
the finest of pioneer stories. It is a
film of climaxes, emotional and !
physical, marked by the virile di- '
rection of William Wellman.
The story is an episodic one which j
covers three generations of a 1
pioneer family, depicting how each I
is assailed by a panic; but each time \
these hardy trail-blazers recover:
and start anew. It concludes with j
the fine thought toward which the
whole film points; that America, de- j
spite depressions, will carry on, so '
long as the pioneer spirit remains, j
Like many three-generation pic- j
tures, this is dominated in the latter j
scenes by the make-up man, who !
in this case achieves happier re- i
suits than usual; Ann Harding's j
make-up is highly convincing.
Miss Harding has weathered many j
cinema storms of late, and though !
this film is a more worthy opus, one i
still does not find the Ann Harding j
who so delighted in "Holiday." Miss ;
Harding's perfoi'mance in this is a i
beautiful piece of work, and her
magnificent, voice is as compelling ;
as ever. In the earlier sequences j
especially she is at "her best; give,
her a piume, a chignon, and the I
sweep of a satin skirt, and there is j
no one like her, as she proved in
"East Lynne."
Richard Dix is again the pioneer
husband, and turns in a splendidly j
sustained performance, almost as
convincing as his Yancey Cravat. I
The most genuine characters are 1
those portrayed by Guy Kibbee and I
Edna May Oliver, the former with 1
a delicate mingling of comedy and
I pathos, and the latter with her
splendid comedy better l-estrained
than usual. —Chapin |
