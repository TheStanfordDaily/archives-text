Coney Island atmosphere,
Gaines of skill and chance,
Gamblin' dens and wrasslin' ,
Food and song and dance.
Pulling coin is easy work.
Barnuin isn't in it—
With the gals who calculate
Four were born each minute.
Never mind the worry when
Sunday morn you wish
You had never angled so
For those gilded fish.
