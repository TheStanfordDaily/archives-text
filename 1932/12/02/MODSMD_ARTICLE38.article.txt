WITH THE RETURN OF
lIAKRY MALONEY from the
A.A.U. convention in New York,
and the subsequent incarcera
tion of that esteemed gentleman
with an attack of flu, we are
reminded that he helped accom
plish quite a little for Stanford
while the convention was in
progress.
For one thing, did you know'that
our Blazing Ben is the proud holder
of no less than three world records?
He has a record of 1:50.9 seconds
for the 880-yard run, hung up at
Kezar Stadium. He is the holder of
a 440-yard mark of 47.1, made
around the two turns in the Coli
seum, and another crown resulted
from his 46.4 made here at Stanford.
Now where Maloney comes into
the picture is that last record. It
seems that the convention didn't
mind giving Ben the mark for two
turns. And the convention was only
professionally interested in the fine,
new Eastman 880 performance, but
when it came to erasing Ted Mere
dith's quarter-mile mark, that was
a horse from another stable.
But you can't down the Irish, and
there on the books is the Blazer's
mark, just as nice as you please.
And if you don't think it is a mark,
just consider that with the metric

system now coming into use there is
very little chance that anyone will
break the record. Because even if
they should decide to take a crack
at it, the run will have to be an
exhibition.
<§• <~*> <•>
England and the United States
were- the only two countries in the
world still using yard system,
and now with Uncle Sam gone over
to the opposition there is very little
chance that Great Britain will con
tinue in the old manner.
The 1.C.4A. officials, lead by
Gustavus T. Kirby, one of the
grand old men of track, voted
last spring to follow suit if the
A.A.U. would lead the way, and
this will all but force the N.C.
A.A. into acceptance.
So you might as well get out the
old millimeter stick and start learn
ing those Olympic times and dis
tances which you thought were in
mothballs for another four years.

professionally interested in the fine,
new Eastman 880 performance, but
when it came to erasing Ted Mere
dith's quarter-mile mark, that was
a horse from another stable.
But you can't down the Irish, and
there on the books is the Blazer's
mark, just as nice as you please.
And if you don't think it is a mark,
just consider that with the metric

system now coming into use there is
very little chance that anyone will
break the record. Because even if
they should decide to take a crack
at it, the run will have to be an
exhibition.

England and the United States
were- the only two countries in the
world still using yard system,
and now with Uncle Sam gone over
to the opposition there is very little
chance that Great Britain will con
tinue in the old manner.
The 1.C.4A. officials, lead by
Gustavus T. Kirby, one of the
grand old men of track, voted
last spring to follow suit if the
A.A.U. would lead the way, and
this will all but force the N.C.
A.A. into acceptance.
So you might as well get out the
old millimeter stick and start learn
ing those Olympic times and dis
tances which you thought were in
mothballs for another four years.

WITH THE RETURN OF
lIAKRY MALONEY from the
A.A.U. convention in New York,
and the subsequent incarcera
tion of that esteemed gentleman
with an attack of flu, we are
reminded that he helped accom
plish quite a little for Stanford
while the convention was in
progress.
For one thing, did you know'that
our Blazing Ben is the proud holder
of no less than three world records?
He has a record of 1:50.9 seconds
for the 880-yard run, hung up at
Kezar Stadium. He is the holder of
a 440-yard mark of 47.1, made
around the two turns in the Coli
seum, and another crown resulted
from his 46.4 made here at Stanford.
Now where Maloney comes into
the picture is that last record. It
seems that the convention didn't
mind giving Ben the mark for two
turns. And the convention was only
professionally interested in the fine,
new Eastman 880 performance, but
when it came to erasing Ted Mere
dith's quarter-mile mark, that was
a horse from another stable.
