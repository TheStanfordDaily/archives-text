# ANNOUNCE SEAL DRIVE RESULTS
## Marked Increase In Profits Over 1931 Returns 
### 
I Early, but incomplete results from
! the Tubercular Christmas Seal Drive
| showed a marked increase over the
: amounts given last year, it was an
nounced yesterday by Anna Louise
! Aynesworth, who is managing the
| campaign on the campus.
At the present time the amounts
: which the various dormitories and
1 eating clubs have contributed are:
El Toro $3.45
El Campo 3.00
Breakers 3.00
El Tigre 2.15
El Cuadro 2.50
Branner 8.64
Sequoia 8.00
Union 8.00
i Toyon 4.15
The comparatively poor showing
jof Toyon can be to the
fact that many of the students are
members of eating clubs, and have
! been solicited for money there.
Through special arrangements
i made by the Mothers' Club with the
| local seal organization, the money
| collected from this drive will go
{ directly to the benefit of Stanford
j students. As the local organization
! required that at least 35 cents out
; of every dollar go to swell its cof
j fers, the Mothers' Club agreede to
I pay this 35 cents.
