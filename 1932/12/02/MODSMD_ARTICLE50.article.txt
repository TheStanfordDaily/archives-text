### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 </P)—
In a startling move, which left
the fouthall world talking to
itself, the University of South
ern California today invited
Pittsburgh as its opponent in
the eighteenth annual Rose
tournament game at Pasadena,
January 2.
An intersectional game of nation
al interest between two teams that
started out the season as world
-1 beaters, and the final Pacific Coast
Conference game of the 1932 season
feature an otherwise dull football
afternoon tomorrow. Already fans
and players are more interested in
choosing honorary grid elevens than
j in the outcome of the dying season's
last splurge.
Alabama and St. Mary's meet to
morrow afternoon in Kezar Stadium.
The game should provide some fine
football, and may even rival in ex
citement and individual brilliance
1 the St. Mary's-Southern Methodist
j game last year. The Gael-Mustang
battle was the best football game
seen by the writer during the 1931
season.
Alabama's season (like St. Mary's)
has been a distinct disappointment,
but their Southern Conference
i schedule was ended with one of the
finest performances of the season on
the part of any team—a 20-0 vic
tory over the heaviest and most
* experienced team in the country,
Vanderbilt University.
The final conference game on the
Pacific Coast brings together Wash
, ington and U.C.L.A., with the Hus

kies striving to gain fourth place in
the final standings, while the Bruins
seek to keep their second-place rat
