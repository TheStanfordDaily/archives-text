## 
### 
Swimming his 50 yards of the
200-yard relay time trial in the
phenomenal time of 24 seconds flat,
Phil Bateson, frosh merman, gave
promise of doing big things for the
Stanford yearlings by the time their
season rolls around next January.
The total time for the relay, which
was swum Wednesday afternoon in
the Encina pool, was 1:47.2. Other
members of the team were Baxter,
Viney, and Dean.
"Although Bateson was racing
from a relay start, his time was
nevertheless excellent when you
consider that he was able to do only
27.3 seconds at a time trial last
October," stated Coach Nort Thorn
ton, swimming mentor.
