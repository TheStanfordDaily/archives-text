Smart social functions, including

fairs, according to U.C.LA. co-eds,
whose entertainment during the
fortnight ended recently has in-
I eluded eighteen parties given at an
| average cost of $21.44.
Included among the fortnight's af
-1 fairs were many post-rushing season
parties with which sororities enter
tained for their newly pledged mem
| bers. In trimming their budgets this
lyear, the co-eds are following very
j literally the request of Dr. E. C.
Moore, vice-president and provost
i of the university, to forego all waste
, ful and costly entertainment,
i Cost of the eighten affairs listed
| with the dean of women by co-cd
j organizations during the two weeks
following the rushing season ranged

from $5 to $60 per party, with but
one group listing an affair at the
latter figure.
An average of 100 guests were en
tertained at each affair and four of
the parties were listed as costing
but $5. These events, explained the
j young hosteses, boasted of no or
chestras and, as most of them were
! given in the organizations' own
! homes, the outstanding cost was
I vested largely in one item—punch.

-1 tions have expressed themselves as
favoring charity and scholarship
i uses for the money which has for
merly been spent on more elaborate
entertainment. Most of the chapters
