John Burton, English lecturer
who kept a U.C.L.A. audience awake
and interested until 4:30 o'clock in
the morning, will speak tomorrow
evening in the Assembly Hall on
"Hopes and Fears of England."
Burton has traveled extensively
and was one of the very few en
gineers in charge of the manufac
ture of projectiles for the British
army during the World War. He has
recently returned from England
where he made a detailed study of
the social attitudes of a cross section
of the English people.
The lecturer, who has been de
scribed as suave, handsome, and
English clad, is now a resident of
California. His early training in the
School of Technology of the Uni
versity of Sheffield qualified him
for his wartime munition work.
When he visited the campus last
spring quarter, speaking on "The
New Patriotism," Burton was bom
barded with questions by Stanford
students at the Assembly Hall until
9 o'clock. Their interest aroused, the
audience followed Burton to the
Union where he answered questions
until midnight.
