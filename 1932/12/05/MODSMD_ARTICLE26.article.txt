# MID-WEST CAGE TOUR FEATURES KANSAS BATTLE
## Squad Of Ten To Leave On December 21 Return On January 5 7 LETTERMEN ELIGIBLE Trip Is Result Of Policy Begun Last Year 
### Frank Tremaine 
For the first time in Stanford his
tory an Indian basketball squad will
invade the Midwest when Coach
John Bunn takes 10 Cardinal cage
stars on a barnstorming tour which
will include 13 games in the two
weeks between December 22 and
January 4.
The feature of the schedule is a
three-game series with the Univer
sity of Kansas at Lawrence Decem
ber 30 and 31 and January 2. As
plans now stand the Indian hoop
sters will leave the night of De
cember 21 and return January 5.
Reno First Stop
The first game will be piayed
with the University of Nevada at
Reno December 22 and the Univer
sity of Utah will be met at Logan
the following night. After a two
day rest, Stanford will play Colo
rado at Boulder the following two
evenings.
From Boulder, the Cards hop to
Lawrence for the three-game Jay
hawker series and on the return
trip meet Nebraska at Lincoln Jan
uary 3 and will probably clash with
the University of Wyoming at Lara
mie January 4.
All Strong Teams
The Nevada game will be the first
the Cardinals have played this sea
son as only a few practice scrim
mages will be held with other
schools before the trip. Although
seven lettermen in addition to a
number of experienced players are
on the Stanford squad no predic
tions for a highly successful season
are being made as exceptionally
strong teams are coming up at other
conference schools.
Tom Cordry will almost certainly
play one forward, but the other, is
wide open, with Payne Palmer,
Charles Glasgow, A1 Page, and
Charles Coiner all battling for it.
Keith Topping will undoubtedly
handle the berth, if eligible. Dave
Packard will probably perform at
center again this year with Hal
Edelen understudying him.
Guard Standouts
Among the guards Jay Tod, John
Hancock, Jack Cosgrove, and Bill
Schnetka are standouts while Carrel
Weaver, who played forward sev
eral yeai's ago, may show up this
season at guard.
The coming barnstorming trip is
a continuation of the policy inau
gurated last season when Stanford
played its first intersectional court
games against Pittsburgh in the lo
cal pavilion. The entire season's
schedule is to be found on page 3
of this issue.
