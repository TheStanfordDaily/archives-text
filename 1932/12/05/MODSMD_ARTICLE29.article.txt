r l ho .S'(in Francisco C.hroniclc throw tho hooks into the
carefullv hatched soliomo of Powell Racier, student affairs
chief at the t'nivemity of California, and President Robert
Cordon Sproul, to suppress Pi Delta Kpsilon's "Razzberry
Press."
Details of the affair are in today's front page story.
The whole tiling goes to show that any attempts to stitle
journalism or to interfere with the "Freedom of the Press")
are apt to he like tossing fat in a fire. The conscientious'
Radcr and his committee heard about some things in big,!
black print that they didn't think the student body ought
to read. So thev rose in righteous wrath and demanded i
111<• 11 a copy of the pink razz sheet be brought to them.
Then, horror-stricken at what they saw, (and probably
after mouthing over the luscious .tidbits among them
selves) they ran to Sproul and asked him to put the foot j
down. Of course he had 110 alternative but to back the I
student administrators.
Hut the editor of the C.hroniclc queered the works by
buying from an "unnamed student" a filched copy of the
razz, and gave the contents just about four times as much
publicity as they would have gotten if the edition had
appeared in the usual manner. He even helped matters,
by running a picture of the front page headline, "RILL
INC.RAM FTMRLES."
So the Racier bunch put the beagles out, and got them!
pushed. It just proves that in Ibis day of enthusiastic,
sensational young journalists, you can't get anywhere at
all with any tactics that smack of suppression.
