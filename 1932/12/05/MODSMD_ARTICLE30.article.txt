.^lnu 1 as opponents for (lie Trojans has caused a greatj
roar of protest from the experts. Why wasn't Michigan
chosen, or even Colgate, the wise men howl. I'.S.C. has I
even been charged with trying to pick an easy opponent j
so they can coast into the national title. Which is all very,
fiinnv, if von ask us.
Stanford, which played both the Trojans and Pitts-,
burgh, swears to a man that the Panthers are a worthy
opponent for any man's ball club, and that furthermore
I'.S.C. will have to plav better than they have all season
to win Ibis game. If you believe in statistics compare the j
figures of the Stanford-I'.S.C.. game with the figures from;
the Stanford-Pittsburgh game. Stanford out-rushed the I
Trojans till afternoon, but Pittsburgh won a statistical
victory as well as the more satisfying numerical win from j
Stanford. In other words, Pitt stopped the Indians cold
at all limes, something no other team was able to do this j
season.
Any follower of sport will concede that the Panthers j
are as colorful as their name. And our vote is cast for any'
team that can beat Notre Dame. Those who attend the j
firsi-of-the-year contest will probably come away con
vinced that the choice of the Smoky Town gentlemen was I
justified. The Trojans may even feel that the choice was
not so justifiable!
