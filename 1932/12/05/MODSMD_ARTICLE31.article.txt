"(iordon Heche was not to blame for having to go back
on his promise to be on hand with his band at the women's!
carnival Saturday night.
"lie did not know that one of his men had signed a
contract to play elsewhere that evening, and as soon as I
he found Ibis out, he immediately notified the dance com- 1
iniltce.
"Cancelling his carnival date lnsl week was not 'an i
eleventh hour' walkout, as the Daily news story Friday
morning said it was.
"The Daily did not check the facts, and overplayed
the incident; the storv of it was written in biased fashion;
Heche was made the victim of an unwarranted and per
sonal attack and the Daily ought to apoligize."
The foregoing is Ihe gist of a campus opinion appear
ing this morning in an adjoining column on this page, and
it is not an unwelcome communication, though it docs!
necessitate editorial comment where it had been hoped
there would have to be none.
First, this business of the news value of the incident.
Somehow it seems that when the orchestra that has been
hallyhoocd for two weeks as the main attraction at an
event of the proportions of Saturday night's carnival sud
denly lells the dance committee on Ihe preceding Wednes
day night that it cannot play and has obtained no substi
tute, Ihe incident constitutes news with an interest that
warranls headlines.
rhen, too, the Daily did check for the facts. In fact
il checked well enough to find a few facts that it had not j
intended to publish. One of these is that (iordon Heche 1
was pretty sure he couldn't play for the carnival almost
a week before he said anything about il to the dance com-!
mi t lee.
Hut that fact, and others thai might be mentioned, are I
incidental to the main issue.
Heche found himself with two dates 011 Ihe same eve- j
ning. One was an engagement off campus somewhere.!
The other was the women's carnival, a show put on in an
effort to raise money to care for Ihe emergencies of needs
students here 011 the Farm.
Why could not Heche have told his off-campus em
ployer just what he told the dance chairman of the carni
val, thai his band could not play and that he had secured
no substitute?

"Cancelling his carnival date lnsl week was not 'an i
eleventh hour' walkout, as the Daily news story Friday
morning said it was.
"The Daily did not check the facts, and overplayed
the incident; the storv of it was written in biased fashion;
Heche was made the victim of an unwarranted and per
sonal attack and the Daily ought to apoligize."
The foregoing is Ihe gist of a campus opinion appear
ing this morning in an adjoining column on this page, and
it is not an unwelcome communication, though it docs!
necessitate editorial comment where it had been hoped
there would have to be none.
First, this business of the news value of the incident.
Somehow it seems that when the orchestra that has been
hallyhoocd for two weeks as the main attraction at an
event of the proportions of Saturday night's carnival sud
denly lells the dance committee on Ihe preceding Wednes
day night that it cannot play and has obtained no substi
tute, Ihe incident constitutes news with an interest that
warranls headlines.
rhen, too, the Daily did check for the facts. In fact
il checked well enough to find a few facts that it had not j
intended to publish. One of these is that (iordon Heche 1
was pretty sure he couldn't play for the carnival almost
a week before he said anything about il to the dance com-!
mi t lee.
Hut that fact, and others thai might be mentioned, are I
incidental to the main issue.
Heche found himself with two dates 011 Ihe same eve- j
ning. One was an engagement off campus somewhere.!
The other was the women's carnival, a show put on in an
effort to raise money to care for Ihe emergencies of needs
students here 011 the Farm.
Why could not Heche have told his off-campus em
ployer just what he told the dance chairman of the carni
val, thai his band could not play and that he had secured
no substitute?
