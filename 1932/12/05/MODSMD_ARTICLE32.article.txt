# BULL SESSION
## SPROUL—OVER WELL-KNOWN BARRELL 
### 
Following the suggestion of the j
Student Affairs Committee, Robert
Gordon Sproul—President of the 1
famous educational institution !
across the Bay—ordered the Razz
berry Press suppressed. So well
suppressed was the razz sheet, that
a Saturday San Francisco paper was !
running front page stories giving all
the lurid details disclosed by the
Razzberry. And now what?
If President Sproul were a '
crooner, he might be warbling, ''Is |
My Face Red?" The editors have;
given a technical salaam to his au- I
thority in that most of the copies j
were burned. Enough copies havej
leaked out, however, to flaunt
Sproul's edict. He has two alterna
tives —one more unpleasant than the
other. He can apply the administra
tive boot to the editors of the razz
and make martyrs out of them. He
can let bad enough alone and
whistle. President Sproul is very
able. He will probably whistle.
In attempting to suppress the un
suppressable razz, Sproul was
carrying out the mandates of the
California Student Government—or
that part of it which is somewhat j
like our own "Men's Council." He |
took evident pains to make it quite ]
clear that he was not acting inde- ;
pendently; but simply for the Af- j
fairs Committee. That was a politic
"out" and a grand gesture to flour
ish before the editors who appeared !
before him requesting a reconsider- I
ation. But . . . President Sproul 1
should have realized that edict or |
no edict the Razzberry would ap- ;
pear; and when it was published, j
he would lack presidential dignity j
hanging over a very large barrel, j

Repression is bad in psychology,
depression in business, suppression
lin journalism, and Congressional
Sessions anytime. To suppress col
lege journalists is always very poor
policy. We haven't seen the Razz
; berry yet; but from the part that
; have been reproduced in the
; Chronicle, it wasn't particularly
harmful.
The real harm came in giving
' publicity to the thing. If the rag was
I banned, there must be "something"
I in it —is the common reaction. Sup-
I pressed books are always the
j choicest reading. You should see
Communists gloating over .simple
bits of literature that are banned.
Dry, musty things that would reach
the nearest wastebasket without the
lure of illegality attached to them.
The same with Berkeley's Razz. The
- copies that leak out will be read to
, tatters. Meanings will creep in
where none were meant.
President Sproul, by backing up
i the Students' Affairs Committee, has
i made what is officially termed a
"problem.'' A little liberalism and
tolerance would have avoided the
j whole thing. At Stanford, "The
I Winds of Freedom Blow"—students
j write what they want. The Admin
| istration, faculty or student, doesn't
i put its beagle in and out at the
| same time. A healthy situation of
freedom with commensurate re
! sponsibility results.
If the Berkeley "disclosures" are
| true, it's mighty fine to trot out the
j sad truth. If they are false, oblivion
; would have swallowed them up.
I "Suppression" was pointless.

Following the suggestion of the j
Student Affairs Committee, Robert
Gordon Sproul—President of the 1
famous educational institution !
across the Bay—ordered the Razz
berry Press suppressed. So well
suppressed was the razz sheet, that
a Saturday San Francisco paper was !
running front page stories giving all
the lurid details disclosed by the
Razzberry. And now what?
If President Sproul were a '
crooner, he might be warbling, ''Is |
My Face Red?" The editors have;
given a technical salaam to his au- I
thority in that most of the copies j
were burned. Enough copies havej
leaked out, however, to flaunt
Sproul's edict. He has two alterna
tives —one more unpleasant than the
other. He can apply the administra
tive boot to the editors of the razz
and make martyrs out of them. He
can let bad enough alone and
whistle. President Sproul is very
able. He will probably whistle.
In attempting to suppress the un
suppressable razz, Sproul was
carrying out the mandates of the
California Student Government—or
that part of it which is somewhat j
like our own "Men's Council." He |
took evident pains to make it quite ]
clear that he was not acting inde- ;
pendently; but simply for the Af- j
fairs Committee. That was a politic
"out" and a grand gesture to flour
