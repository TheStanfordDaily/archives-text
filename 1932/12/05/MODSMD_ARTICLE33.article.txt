THE HEADING OF GHOSTS —
With a plea to Sword and Sandals.
The redding last Thursday eve
ning of Ibsen's "Ghosts," climaxed
a series of similar readings which
Sword and Sandals has presented
during the past three quarters. The
readings thus far have been chiefly
J of comedies: Private Lives, Home
' Chat, Olympia, Of Thee I Sing—all
j far easier to read and to hear than
the powerful Ibsen tragedy.
The audience, however, was
caught up by exceptionally fine
, reading of the tragedy, and the eve
i ning proved definitely that tragedy
may be read as well as the lighter
■ pieces.
The evening's finest performance
: was that of Dr. Margery Bailey, who
| built Mrs. Alving's struggles against
I a catastrophe inavertable and ter-
I rible to agonizing heights. It was
the first serious role I have seen
her play after "The Silver Cord,"
j "Romeo and Juliet," and "The Way
■ of the World" was a proof of her
j ability at repertoire.
Harold Helvenston, playing the
! role of Oswald down considerably,
j almost plaintively, in the first act
! and in preparation for a second act
■ scene of power and self-reproaching
I anguish which was his highest mo
ment, easily took next honors. Be
! ginning very quietly—and perhaps
i a little too low—his building was
excellent and his final scene with
J Mrs. Alving a terrific climax.
A. Grove Day, hampered by lines
! which seem more amusingly hypo
| critical today than when the play
| was written, and with an odd ca
j dence in his speech which made
' him a little more fatuous than Ibsen
intended, was a good representative
1 of the conventions which brought
j about the catastrophe.
Robert Cathcart lost none of the
hypocrisy of Engstrand, and played
his role smoothly. The character of
Regina is peculiarly built—by refer
ence to the girl in the speeches of
i other characters rather than by her
1 own actions. It was doubly hard
j therefore to make the character real
in her single full scene. Josephine
I Filcher succeeded very well.
This reading is the best that
Sword and Sandals has thus far
attempted; its flaws were imma-

I lerial, its virtues many. It proved
j beyond doubt not only that campus
| audiences will receive serious drama
as it deserves to be received but,
I more importantly, that this type of
play—a tragedy of inner, mental ac
tion and therefore little concerned
with physical action—can be as ef
fectively read as staged.
It is sincerely to be hoped that
ihese readings will be continued in
the future—particularly with a con
j sideration of the less light-hearted
plays and those which, more diffi
cult to stage, infrequently find stage
representation.
Sword and Sandals and its presi
dent, Vallejo Gantner, through
j whose activity, chiefly, the readings
have been presented, are deserving
of commendation—with the request
that despite Gantner's departure
this valuable and revealing activity
continue. —Sandoe
! STRANGE INTERLUDE—At the
i St. Francis Theatre, San Francisco
Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer, Eugene
O'Neill, Robert Z. Leonard, and
i Norma Shearer get together in the
| production of this great picture,
j which, paradoxically, is not par
ticularly good. Great—but not good.
! That's' ''Strange Interlude." Norma
Shearer cannot be blamed for the
picture's failure to attain the
heights of cinematic entertainment,
nor, naturally, can O'Neill.
I The trouble all began in the cast
; ing, with that devastating charmer
j Clark Gable in the most obvious
1 misfit. As Doctor Darrell he suc
-1 ceeded in being little better than
the old he-man Gable, failing to age
i as gracefully as the other characters.
Ralph Morgan, playing the diffi
j cult role of Charlie Marsden, was
I the weakest character. His asides,
I pantomimed in the presence of other
characters, were so definitely over
acted as to appear incongruous.
Alexander Kirkland as Sam Evans,
the third important male figure in
the lot, appeared to be playing a
role a trifle beyond his under
standing.
So much for weaknesses. Norma
Shearer was splendid as Nina Leeds,
the neurotic heroine. She alone of
all the major characters had suffi

cient restraint to portray the com
plex and swiftly-changing O'Neill
moods without the risk of incon
gruity.
"Strange Interlude" is a great
picture because it marks the dis
covery of a new field for motion
picture entertainment. The pro
ducers and Director Leonard did re
markably well in adapting a six
hour stage vehicle to a two-hour
film, and their experiment with a
double sound track achieved a great
advance in talking picture tech
nique.
Regardless of whatever unfavor
able criticism or praise critics may
heap upon it, "Sti'ange Interlude"
is a picture every movie fan should
see; because of the power of O'Neill's
drama; because of the great accom
plishment it is for motion pictures;
and because of the superbly good
film it might have been, had Norma
Shearer been given a Leslie Howard,
a Frederic March, and a Herbert
Marshall for the roles of her three
men. —Goodwin
