DEMAND APOLOGY
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily's article in Friday's is
sue entitled "Heche Band Quits
Carnival" is an outstanding example
of what campus journalism should
not be. To make a personal broad
side against a student is in itself
bad taste; and to make such a
broadside which is based on erro
neous material and is couched in
misleading terms places the Daily
in the same category as the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin and other
sensational journals.
We do not know to what extent
the Carnival committee is respon
sible for the writing of the article;
but we do know that the Daily is
to be criticized for allowing such
an article to run without checking
up on the material. The article lacks

the impersonal attitude of good
journalism.
The heading itself, printed in a
four-column spread, is entirely out
of keeping with the importance of
the news, which is itself exagger
ated and misstated.
Here are the real facts of the case:
unknown to Heche, another member
agree. Previously, another member
of his orchestra had booked a job
for the same night, but was called
away to play on a boat trip, before
he was able to notify Heche. When
the other fellow informed Heche
upon returning last Tuesday, Heche
immediately notified the Carnival
chairman. (Hardly an "eleventh-hour
walkout.") This probably put the
Carnival committee to do a little
extra work, but was unavoidable as
far as Heche was concerned. Fur
i thermore, Heche gave up the op
portunity to make a few dollars in
order to play at the Carnival him
self, even though his orchestra Mad
to play elsewhere. In return for this
attempt to do his bit for the Car
nival, he gets a slap in the face
from the Carnival chairman and
from the Daily.
In the light of Gordon Heche's
I reputation and his previous contri
-1 butions to benefits on this campus,
Iwe feel that an apology is due him
1 either from the Daily, the Carnival
j Committee, or both.

DEMAND APOLOGY
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily's article in Friday's is
sue entitled "Heche Band Quits
Carnival" is an outstanding example
of what campus journalism should
not be. To make a personal broad
side against a student is in itself
bad taste; and to make such a
broadside which is based on erro
neous material and is couched in
misleading terms places the Daily
in the same category as the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin and other
sensational journals.
We do not know to what extent
the Carnival committee is respon
sible for the writing of the article;
but we do know that the Daily is
to be criticized for allowing such
an article to run without checking
up on the material. The article lacks

the impersonal attitude of good
journalism.
The heading itself, printed in a
four-column spread, is entirely out
of keeping with the importance of
the news, which is itself exagger
ated and misstated.
Here are the real facts of the case:
unknown to Heche, another member
agree. Previously, another member
of his orchestra had booked a job
for the same night, but was called
away to play on a boat trip, before
he was able to notify Heche. When
the other fellow informed Heche
upon returning last Tuesday, Heche
immediately notified the Carnival
chairman. (Hardly an "eleventh-hour
walkout.") This probably put the
Carnival committee to do a little
extra work, but was unavoidable as
far as Heche was concerned. Fur
i thermore, Heche gave up the op
portunity to make a few dollars in
order to play at the Carnival him
self, even though his orchestra Mad
to play elsewhere. In return for this
attempt to do his bit for the Car
nival, he gets a slap in the face
from the Carnival chairman and
from the Daily.
In the light of Gordon Heche's
I reputation and his previous contri
-1 butions to benefits on this campus,
Iwe feel that an apology is due him
1 either from the Daily, the Carnival
j Committee, or both.
