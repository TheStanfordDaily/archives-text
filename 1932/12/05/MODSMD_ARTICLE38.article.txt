ONE OF TIIE MOST SATIS
FACTORY GAMES we have
had the pleasure of watching
(his year—briefly that was our
impression of the Alabania-St.
Mary's tussle last Saturday in
Kezar Stadium.
The 'Banners looked as if they had
been through a tough season, but
when they needed to hold they rose
to the occasion nobly. In particular,
the defensive work of left tackle
Jim Dildy and the offensive and de
fensive playing of left half Miller
Howell were oustanding.
This man Howell, they tell us, is
only a sophomore, but to mention
just one of his accomplishments, he
kicked 17 times and averaged a mere
45 yards. Aside from that, he is one
of the fastest men seen on this Coast
in a long time.
FOR THOSE WIIO LIKE
their long runs with plenty of
thrills, that 71-year junt put on
by the great "Ilurr'y" Cain was
just about the sweetest piece of
work that we hope to see. lie
has a beautiful change of pace,
and a straight-arm that hits like
a locomotive piston.
Alabama made most of its yard
age from the straight punt forma
tion, with the man back carrying
the ball, but their scoring play was
a deviation that caught the Saints
flat-footed. Cain, playing up close
to the line, with Holley calling sig
nals, Walker playing in close also,
and Howell back, took the ball from
the quarterback and cut through
right tackle.
From the time he cleared the line
of scrimmage until he stumbled
across the last chalk line, his only
assistance came from light end
Leach who crossed over and only
half blocked Charlie Baird, the Gael
safety man. Cain took care of Dod
son, Brovelli, and Baird himself. It
was Baird's frantic clutch that al
most upset the Tuscaloosa wonder
before he could fall across the goal
line.
Angel Brovelli tried gamely to
stem the Criinon Tide single
handed, but it was too much to
ask of any one man. Madigan
tried them all, and the only one
who could even dent that Tide
forward line was Dodson. When
yards meant scores, Alabama
collected them.
Brovelli undoubtedly is all that
he is cracked up to be, and it was
Alabama's superior playing that
won, not any miscues on the Dark
Angel's part. —Bob Wade

ONE OF TIIE MOST SATIS
FACTORY GAMES we have
had the pleasure of watching
(his year—briefly that was our
impression of the Alabania-St.
Mary's tussle last Saturday in
Kezar Stadium.
The 'Banners looked as if they had
been through a tough season, but
when they needed to hold they rose
to the occasion nobly. In particular,
the defensive work of left tackle
Jim Dildy and the offensive and de
fensive playing of left half Miller
Howell were oustanding.
This man Howell, they tell us, is
only a sophomore, but to mention
just one of his accomplishments, he
kicked 17 times and averaged a mere
45 yards. Aside from that, he is one
of the fastest men seen on this Coast
in a long time.
FOR THOSE WIIO LIKE
their long runs with plenty of
thrills, that 71-year junt put on
by the great "Ilurr'y" Cain was
just about the sweetest piece of
work that we hope to see. lie
has a beautiful change of pace,
and a straight-arm that hits like
a locomotive piston.
Alabama made most of its yard
age from the straight punt forma
tion, with the man back carrying
the ball, but their scoring play was
a deviation that caught the Saints
flat-footed. Cain, playing up close
to the line, with Holley calling sig
nals, Walker playing in close also,
and Howell back, took the ball from
the quarterback and cut through
right tackle.
From the time he cleared the line
of scrimmage until he stumbled
across the last chalk line, his only
assistance came from light end
Leach who crossed over and only
half blocked Charlie Baird, the Gael
safety man. Cain took care of Dod
son, Brovelli, and Baird himself. It
was Baird's frantic clutch that al
most upset the Tuscaloosa wonder
before he could fall across the goal
line.
Angel Brovelli tried gamely to
stem the Criinon Tide single
handed, but it was too much to
ask of any one man. Madigan
tried them all, and the only one
who could even dent that Tide
forward line was Dodson. When
yards meant scores, Alabama
collected them.
Brovelli undoubtedly is all that
he is cracked up to be, and it was
Alabama's superior playing that
won, not any miscues on the Dark
Angel's part. —Bob Wade
