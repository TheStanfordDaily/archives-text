# Eastman Clips 1.6 from Pre-Season 440 Record
## LYMAN ADDS NINE INCHES TO AUTUMN SHOT PUT MARK Small Turnout And Illness Prevent Assault On More Records 
### Wadsworth White 
Knocking 1.6 seconds off the pre
season 440-yard dash records, Ben
Eastman, Stanford track captain,
strode the quarter-mile stretch in
48.4 seconds at the practice meet in
the old oval Friday afternoon.
This is the first time to date East
man has run the 440 in an autumn
practice meet. His time is just .4
seconds above the Big Meet records
he forgot to break last spring quar
ter.
Shot Put Record
Nine inches were added to the
shot put record for these early
season meets by Johnny Lyman. He
heaved the 16-pound cannon ball
50 feet 6Vz inches.
No other practice meet records
wore bettered except these two. The
small turnout, illnesses, and the fact
that the tracksters have not yet
been worked into form, explains
this. How many rough spots have
so far been ironed out may be ap
proximated from a summary of Fri
day's inter-individual meet.
