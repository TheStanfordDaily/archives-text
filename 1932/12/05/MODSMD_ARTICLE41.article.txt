# Football Only Sport For Dartmouth Frosh
## 
### 
As a result of a drastic edict by
(he Athletic Council of Dartmouth
College, all freshman sports, with
the exception of football, have been
abandoned indefinitely. It is hoped
that by this step the athletic depart
ment will save about $15,000 a year,
which money may be used for (he
development of greatest varsity
teams.
This is the policy (hat is pursued
by the Big Ten association, and,
while Dartmouth is the first eastern
school of major importance to adopt
the scheme, it is expected (hat many
other institutions on the Atlantic
seaboard will soon adopt it.
A drop of more than 30 per cent
in registrations of new passenger
cars was reported by 46 states and
the District of Columbia for the
first six months of 1932.
