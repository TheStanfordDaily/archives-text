# "Pop's" Status Quo Agreeable
## 
### 
I Returning from a hunting trip
1 late yesterday, Graduate Manager
I A1 Masters declared that the War-
I ner situation remains virtually the
j same as it has been since Warner
j returned from New York last Fri
| day.
"Warner is a l'cgularly appointed
i member of the faculty," Masters
said, "and until he signifies his dis
satisfaction with matters as they are
jwe can only conclude that he is
i well satisfied. There will probably
Ibe no action on the part of the
â€¢ Board of Athletic Control."
Warner is at home in Palo Alto,
j where it is reported that he is re
i covering from the cold contracted
j in Pittsburgh. In view of the fact
j that Pop invariably returns from the
j East with his health impaired, it is
I felt that he will make every effort to
j remain on the coast. Any action to
i the contrary will have to come from
! the Old Man himself, since the
| Board has voiced its satisfaction
j with his work.
