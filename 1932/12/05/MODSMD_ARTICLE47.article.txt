## John McKelvey Wins From Walter Doyle In Feature Race 
### 
It looks like another water polo
championship for Stanford.
Outplaying the Alumni All-Stars
in every department of the game and
completely bewildering them with a
new passing attack, the varsity
tankmen Saturday gave fair warn
ing to the rest of the Pacific Coast
that they are out for another water
polo title. The final score was 8 to 1.
Although the Alumni team in
cluded three former Olympic stars
and several other players, famous
in Stanford tank history, Coach
Nort Thornton's four sophomores,
one junior and two seniors made
the veterans look like novices.
Vlad Taranik, playing his first
varsity game, was the outstanding
man for the winners, with Gordy
Graves, the other breaking guard,
right up there with him.
The undergraduates were strong
on defense. When the alumni did
get the ball, which was seldom, they
rarely kept it long enough to get a
shot.
In the featuie race over the 100- [
yar dcourse, John McKelvey didn't
extend himself to win over Walter
Doyle, although Doyle was only
about five feet behind at the finish.
The time was 55.3 seconds.
Stanford's varsity divers opened'
the program with a series of diffi- j
cult springboard and high platform !
exhibition. They closed with a form- i
ation dive in which all five men
were in the air at the same time. i
