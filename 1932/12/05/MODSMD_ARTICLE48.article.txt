# DRASTIC CUT IN FROSH CAGEMEN LEAVES TWENTY
## Team Looms As Best Since First Year Wonder Outfit Of 1926 
### 
By one drastic stroke, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw. head man of the
freshman basketball team, last Fri
day cut his troops from a veritable
army of hopeful aspirants to a
small squad of well-drilled cage
men, leaving only twenty players on
the roll call. This group bids fair to
become the strongest first-year
basketball team that has reported at
Stanford since 1926.
Although no distinction has been
made as yet between the various
players, several men have made
themselves outstanding by their
brilliant work in shooting and in
scrimmage. First among this group,
probably, is Addie Barnett, a cool
and experienced performer from
Santa Monica. Barnett is a guard
and will prove valuable to John
Bunn in the years to come. Another
scintillating player is Ralph Man
nion, a forward from Oakland.
Others among the outstanding
players are Wally Brooke, Jake
Katz, Alec Thompas, Rosy Rosen
berg, Harry Dutton, Bob Roth, Dave
Farber, Don Maentz, Woody Adams,
and Johnny Reisner.
The frosh will have one of the
stiffest contests of their fifteen-game
schedule at the very beginning when
they meet the highly touted S.F.U.
brigade. The success of the season
will depend greatly upon getting off
to a good start, and, therefore, Brad
shaw is wasting no time in whipping
his men into shape for this game.
