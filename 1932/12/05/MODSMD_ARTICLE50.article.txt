# GAMECOCKS UPSET AUBURN GRID HOPE
## 
### Albert Guerard 
South Carolina, putting on the
most thrilling finish of the 1932 sea
son, upset Auburn's hopes for an
undisputed Southern Conference
championship Saturday afternoon.
The Gamecocks scored twice in the
fourth quarter, stopped All-Ameri
can Jim Hitchcock without large
gain, and held the Plainsmen to a
20-20 tie.
Louisiana State University, like
wise undefeated in conference com
petition, but beaten by two other
teams, Rice Institute and Centenary
College, may now advance titular
claims as valid as Auburn's. A third
Southern title claimant evolved
from Tennessee's 32-13 victory over
Florida.
The last big Saturday of sched
uled football provided three big up
sets in eight games, just about the
same proportion that has astounded
experts all year.
Alabama, not a contender in
Southern Conference competition,
defeated St. Mary's when John Cain
smashed over Lafayette Gould for
72 yards and a touchdown early in
the first quarter. The Alabama
team showed much fine football, and
indicated that Southern football was
probably of a higher calibre than
the Pacific Coast variety this year.
The South Carolina-Auburn 20-
20 tie was a big upset, as was Man
hattan's defeat of Rutgers. Chick
Meehan's Manhattan eleven, ad
mittedly playing football "for the
fun of it" and not to win, ended its
season without any evidence of
staleness or fatigue—a complete
vindication of a system that would
better football considerably if all
teams adopted it.
Washington closed the Pacific
Coast Conference season with a 19-0
victory over U.C.L.A.'s Bruins. It
was the second conference defeat for
the Westwood eleven, and added to
the fine record of a Husky team that
defeated Stanford, and held U.S.C.
to a 9-6 score in its two most im
portant games.
Next Saturday's schedule features
Notre Dame-U.S.C. at Los Angeles.
It should be the best game of the
year, even though the Ramblers
have been defeated.

gain, and held the Plainsmen to a
20-20 tie.
Louisiana State University, like
wise undefeated in conference com
petition, but beaten by two other
teams, Rice Institute and Centenary
College, may now advance titular
claims as valid as Auburn's. A third
Southern title claimant evolved
from Tennessee's 32-13 victory over
Florida.
The last big Saturday of sched
uled football provided three big up
sets in eight games, just about the
same proportion that has astounded
experts all year.
Alabama, not a contender in
Southern Conference competition,
defeated St. Mary's when John Cain
smashed over Lafayette Gould for
72 yards and a touchdown early in
the first quarter. The Alabama
team showed much fine football, and
indicated that Southern football was
probably of a higher calibre than
the Pacific Coast variety this year.
The South Carolina-Auburn 20-
20 tie was a big upset, as was Man
hattan's defeat of Rutgers. Chick
Meehan's Manhattan eleven, ad
mittedly playing football "for the
fun of it" and not to win, ended its
season without any evidence of
staleness or fatigue—a complete
vindication of a system that would
better football considerably if all
teams adopted it.
Washington closed the Pacific
Coast Conference season with a 19-0
victory over U.C.L.A.'s Bruins. It
was the second conference defeat for
the Westwood eleven, and added to
the fine record of a Husky team that
defeated Stanford, and held U.S.C.
to a 9-6 score in its two most im
portant games.
Next Saturday's schedule features
Notre Dame-U.S.C. at Los Angeles.
It should be the best game of the
year, even though the Ramblers
have been defeated.
