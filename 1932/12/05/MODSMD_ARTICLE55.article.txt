Wilh appropriate costumes, effec
tive settings, and easy flowing Ger
j man from the 15 members of the
I cast of "An Old German Christmas
I Play," the production sponsored by
| the German Honor Society and
i given in the Little Theatre Friday
; night, was a marked success.
Dr. Kurt Reinhardt, taking the
role of King Herod, was a most
| forceful character, with his master
| ful interpretation. The presence of
Dr. Reinhardt on the stage was not
, expected, as Stanley Sharp had
' been cast in the part, but because
of a recent illness was not able to
j take it. In addition to taking the
! part, Dr. Reinhardt directed the
production with the help of Sharp.
Claire Mitchcll, as Mary, played a
I difficult role successfully. Voice, fa
cial expression, and interpretation
all pleased the audience. The other
feminine role, the angel, played by
| Eleanor Furst, was most effectively
1 done. Her voice was delightfully
j suited to the part.
C. E. Byre was a very realistic
; Joseph, but was not outstanding. Of
I the three shepherds, Jean Becke,
Ernst Giesccke, a'nd A. E. Sokol, the
[ latter was the best. Although all of
I them played well and won their
applause, Sokol was more natural.
' The three kings, Joseph Ponti,
| Henri Lindgren, and Gunther
i Detert, did not have outstanding
; parts. Others in the cast with minor
roles were James Beckerley, Robert
Gordon, Donald Morgan, Schertzen
j Spring, and Rafael Silver.
The jail at New Lexington, Ohio,
has not housed a prisoner for five
I years.
