# RUSH BEER BILL IN CONGRESS AS REPEAL BALKED
## Extra Session Held Certain; To Result Rrom Lame Duck Dry Vote 6 NAYS STOP LIQUOR Party Lines Erased In Wet Strength Test Ballot 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 (A 3 ) — A j
bold and unprecedented leadership (
lo force its parly's outright prohibi- !
lion repeal proposal through the {
House failed today and dimmed |
prospects of further action on the j
issue in that branch during the re- j
mainder of the short session.
The action was interpreted on j
Capitol Hill as foreshadowing a spe- j
cial session of the new Congress j
next spring soon after President- i
elect Roosevelt is inaugurated so i
that the Democrats may carry out
their pledge for flat repeal.
Early liallot Planned
Despite the defeat of the resolu- i
lion by the narrow margin of 272 to [
144 -two-thirds majority being re- j
quired for adoption—the Democrats j
planned immediate attack on the j
problem of modifying the Volstead I
law. Speaker Garner hopes a beer i
bill will be ready for action before |
the Christmas holidays.
Eighty-one "lame ducks," mem- !
hers not returned to the next Con
gress, and thirty-three Democrats]
re-elected in November voted j
against the measure. Sixty-nine de
ft a ted incumbents voted for it. A !
shift of six votes from the negative j
to the affirmative would have sent ;
the resolution, to the Senate.
Party Lines Split
Altogether JOB Democrats, 10«> i
Republicans, and one Farmer-Labor j
voted for the measure; forty-four j
Democrats and 100 Republicans i
vote dagainst it. Eleven of the ]
Democrats opposing are "lame i
ducks," while seventy are Repub
licans.
Spectacular in its inception, swift- i
ness or action and failure, the
Democratic effort will go down in
history as the first to bring a con- i
stitutional amendment before a ,
legislative branch of the Govern- j
I nt under procedure preventing i
f amendments and curtailing de- I
e lo forty minutes.
First Repeal Test
It was the first test in Congress i
on flat repeal of the eighteenth '
amendment since it was voted into
the constitution in 1917, although '
the Beck-Linthicum submission pro- j
posal was defeated last spring 227
to 187.
Speaker Garner was greeted |
warmly as he vigorously walked j
into the chamber promptly at 12
o'clock to open the House. The gal- j
lories were packed with prominent ,
persons, even the seldom used ex- ;
ecutive and diplomatic sections.
Senators and members of the Cabi- (
