# Warner Gives Big Scoop To Friend Leiser
## Attacks By Alumni Thought Cause Of Resignation 
### Rolph Malloch 
Pop Warner's resignation — the |
biggest sports news story to break J
recently—was foretold exclusively J
in the San Francisco Examiner yes- j
terday morning. William Leiser,
Hearst sports writer and a close |
personal friend of Warner's, was i
given the scoop Sunday evening at i
the Warner home in Palo Alto.
Leiser has been known for some j
time as a staunch supporter of the j
Stanford coach in ;11 moments of |
adversity, and the awarding of the ,
exclusive story to him is interpreted j
by many sports followers to be the |
last grandiose gesture of the veter- '
an coach before he leaves for the i
East.
Assistant Football Coach "Rabbit"
Bradshaw pointed out that Warner \
it. not going to Temple University ;
for monetary reasons, as the same j
contract, with the same advance in I
salary, was turned down by Warner j
last year. The explanation of the 1
resignation, Bradshaw believes, lies I
in the alumni dissatisfaction. "Not j
that he would resign under fire— j
any one who knows the man would '
know that couldn't be true—but he i
felt, possibly, that for the good of
Stanford the dissension should be
stopped."
Bradshaw also pointed out that i
another possibility as head coach, j
so far unmentioned, is Bob Evans, j
coach in 1919. At present much of i
the local sentiment is in favor of
Ernie Nevers, who was All-Ameri
can fullback when he captained the I
Stanford team.
When he received Warner's resig- ,
nation yesterday morning, Dr. j
Thomas A. Storey, head of the
School of Hygiene and Physical
Education, made the following state- j
ment:
"I have received the resignation
of Mr. Glenn S. Warner as head of
the department of football at Stan- [
ford and, if Mr. Warner's decision
is final, shall pass it along regret
fully to the authorities in the Uni
versity with whom final action rests. J
''I am sure I voice the sentiments
of all of us who have been in touch i
with Warner in his official capacity i
as well as personally when I say ;
that he has proved himself here at
Stanford to be a leader among men
in his profession in the country. He
has maintained the standards set by
the University in its intercollegiate
relationships by faithfully •support
ing those standards in spirit as well
as in letter.
"His popularity with the team and
with the students has been greater
in the season just closed than at any
other time since lie came to Stan- !
ford.
"My personal appreciation of Mr.
Warner is emphasized by his co
operation in all details of official
procedure in his capacity as director
of a department of the School of
Hygiene and Physical Education."
