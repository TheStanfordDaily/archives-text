# Row Over New Coach Looms In Old Fox's Wake
## Warner Packs Up As "Wolves" Clash Over Successor; Clipper Smith, Thornhill, Nevers Get Backing; Alumni Gird For Battle To Name Next Man 
### BOB WADE 
"The king is dead! Long live the king!"
Before the echoes of Glenn Scobey Warner's almost unbelievable
resignation bad ceased reverberating from a badly spoiled Pacific Coast
to staid old Philadelphia, the wolves that howled Stanford's Biij Chief
into folding his tepee had commenced to light among themselves as they
hunted for new and better wolf meat.
Maurice "Clipper" Smith, head man at Santa Clara, burst into the
limelight with a surprisingly strong contingent of backers; Claude "Tiny"
Thornhill, line coach at Stanford for the past eleven years, seemingly led
the parade of the innocents; Ernie Nevers, the greatest player Pop ever
coached, according to the Old Fox himself, was right in the running, with

• his alumni backers prepared to fight
j to the last ditch for the man they
| have claimed could do more than
I the Grand Old Man himself.
Dick Hanley of Northwestern and
I Andy Kerr of Colgate, both suc-
I cessful exponents of the Warner
I system, have been mentioned as
j possible prospects, but both of them
' have positions that should hold them
! where they are.
Can't Relieve News
But while suppositions were rife,
! and scores oi opinions emanated
I from every quarter, official and
.unofficial Stanford held its head and
! wondered how the Old Maestro had
j been allowed to escape from the
I Indian village.
All Stanford, securely blase in the
| assurance that Pop could never tear
! himself away from the Farm and
the team that he built up from the
| very depths of the football dol
! drums, is still unable to believe that
i the blow has actually fallen.
Varsity Pleads With "Pop"
Thirty-two Indian varsity mem
| bers, the men who fought their
J hearts out through a schedule that
| saw Stanford drop four major
; games, pleaded with the Old Fox l<»
remain and guide them for another
year. With tears in their eyes they
| begged the man who has forgotten
j more football than most of his
j probable successors have ever
| learned to wait just one more sea
! son.
! It was all that tha Stanford Sa
chem could do to resist the en
' treaties of the Corbusses, the Sims,
I and the Hillmans that lie has
| coached from obscurity to the limc
j light of the nation's grid greats. But
he had signed the contract that
makes liini head coach of football
j at Temple University, and his mind
: is made up.
Circat 9-Year Record
In nine years Warner teams have
. piled up 72 victories against seven
ties and 16 defeats. And that is thf
record of the man that disgruntled
; southern California alumni were
I going to investigate sometime this
' week.
' In his only official announcement
Iso far, Acting-President Robert
! Eckles Swain said last night:
"The withdrawal of Coach War
! ner is a distinct loss to the Univer
sity. During the years which he has
.spent at Stanford he has won a high
| place in our esteem for his fine,
I sturdy character, for his brilliancy
!as a coach, and for the ideals of
good sportsmanship and conduct on
| the field and off of it for which lie
! has always stood.
"Very Sorry"
"He has rendered a service to thfe
! University which has gone far be
' yond that of winning games, and
we are grateful to him for it.
"I am very sorry to see him go."
