# THE 						WOLVES GET THE GOALPOSTS
## 
### 
Well, the "wolves ill the door" won. A drawn-out pe-i
riod of conecntrated howling on the part of a minority j
group of alumni "wolves" ended yesterday when Pop
Warner handed over to them the hone of contention. The
"Old Fox" foxed everybody again when he handed his
resignation from the position of head football coach to
the Hoard of Athletic Control.
Stanford hates to see Warner go, but no one blames j
him particularly for tendering his resignation. Pop has
been dissatisfied with this and that around the campus;
for some time, lie has been heckled bv victory-thirsty old
grads, once to a point where he threatened leaving his po
sition. He has been offered a position which represents
;in advance in his coaching profession. Surely 110 one these'
days can pass by an increase in salary, such as Temple |
t'niversity has promised. In Philadelphia Warner will find
himself once again on the most advantageous spot a grid-!
iron coach may occupy. lie will he the "Old Fox" again, j
at the head of a new athletic venture, just as he once was
on the Farm.
From the standpoint of the alumni, the situation was;
unfortunate. Yesterday there was disappointment in manyj
al'unini camps. In the southern part of the state there was!
jubilation. The great share of anti-Warner agitation ema-l
nated from the Los Angeles area, but the attitude of L.A.j
Stanford men cannot be held against them either. Theirs j
lias been a bitter lot wearing the Cardinal among swarms'
of gloating, taunting Trojan adherents.
This wail from the South appears to have penetrated!
Pop's skiu to some extent, combining with a consideration,
of coaching prospects at Stanford and Temple to produce
his decision. The alumni howl, almost inevitable, was
nevertheless unfortunate because of the great publicity it
was given. The Daily feels that Warner tended to ex
aggerate the amount of sentiment against him. Perhaps
that factor did not play a great part in his decision, but it
would he still more unfortunate were Warner to leave
Stanford feeling that he was leaving a campus where he
was totally surrounded by "wolves."
Pop Warner leaves Stanford with the good wishes of
th<* students, the* team, the majority of alumni, and his'
employers, the Hoard of Athletic Control. During the past
season, Warner's toughest in the Coast Conference, the
whole-hearted support of the team, the students, the
alumni, and the H.A.C. has never waivered. Coaching at
Temple, he will still be "good old Pop" to Stanford.
