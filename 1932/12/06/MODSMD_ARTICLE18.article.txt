# IT'S A CINCH

Tonight the Kx Committee will take stops to remedy aj
situation that screams to high heaven for correction. That
is the method of selecting yell leaders here on the Farm, j
I'ndor the present system, the head yell king is elected)
bv Ihe student body in the regular May election. That, on
the face of it, is so obviously poor procedure that it pre
cludes argument. How can students choose between candi
dates after watching them perform" through the football
season, and then go into hibernation until spring, when \
their names, almost forgotten, suddenly appear on a ballot ?|
Few voters can remember which of the two it was who!
employed that intriguing little flourish of the left hand
on the "Xu spell," for example. They are more likely to
base their choice between the two upon yell leading ability,!
instead of upon hearsay, or politics, if the election is held'
immediately after football season ends.
That plan will insure a better choice of head yell king.
The question that now arises is that of securing from the
mob of tryoutees the two best men for assistants. As it
stands now, the rally committee, after intensive tryouts, i
gives the six most promising tryoutees the opportunity to
show before basketball crowds, and then to run for as
sistanlships in the regular May election. Thus the students
face six names belonging to men of whom they have
gained only a glimpse, and whom, most likely, they have!
forgotten entirely.
Certainly the rally committee, in a position to know!
the tryoutees and their respective abilities, could do a
much better job of selecting assistants than can the stu
dents in a general election.
With appointment of assistants, and autumn quarter
election of yell king, the brand of yell leading on the Farm
ought to rise out of the rut of mediocrity in which it has!
been laboring for vears.
The Daily staff will gather in awful assembly according
to the laws as laid down.
