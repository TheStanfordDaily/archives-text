# BULL SESSION
## PRESERVED IN IGNORANCE 
### 
Some 'America-First -And-Only"
society is attempting to prevent Mr.
Albert Einstein from entering these
merry United States. The terrible
charge is that the gentleman is af
filiated with the evil and sinister
forces of communism and anarchism.
Mr. Einstein is of course remem
bered as the world's No. 1 Relativity
Man and probably the only 'mathe-
matician in the world to be wel
comed by the Master of Welcomers,
the late lamented Mayor of New
York—Jimmie Walker. Either ac
complishment is sufficient to make
a man famous. Einstein has both.
These well-meaning women who
are seeking to rob Princeton of its
famous educational, scoop fear that
the mighty ideals and institutions of
this nation will be endangered by a
little, shy, retiring scientist. It is
clear that Einstein will do little over
here but lecture on his subject, give
out an interview or so monthly, and
run some well-rosined horse hairs
ever his fiddle strings.
If that constitutes a menace to the
foundations of this country, it is
high time to pack up everything and
sail for Mars or maybe even Jupiter.
Why is it that those who claim to
be the most boisterous boosters for
this government of ours, quake the
most at every ripple of antagonism
to it? Especially, when everyone
knows that 12,000,000 unemployed
constitute more of a menace than
62 Einsteins.
In fact, Einstein is so harmless
that only the most rabid, narrow
minded, high blood-pressured "pa
triots" could object to this inoffen
sive little man. Many more might
object to a communist of the blood
and-thunder type like Trotzky be

ing admitted to this country for a
speaking tour. Personally, I think it
would be a great idea. And Trotsky
being unemployed at the moment,
would probably accept a speaking
engagement in this country.
He is one of the figures of the
century and it would really be ah
educational asset to have the Old
Boy come over here under some
body's auspices. I would like to see
the self-made general and states
man. I don't like communism and I
wouldn't exactly choose Trotsky for
a roommate or a fourth at bridge—
but it surely would be entertaining
to hear him, and instructive as
well.
And what harm could he possibly
d othe myth that all communists
carry bombs under their beards
being exploded with the introduc
tion of Gillette unto Russia? He
might convei't a few weak-willed
incipient dementia cases who could
be converted to anything by any
body with an emotionat appeal —
Mussolini, Prince of Wales, Rudy
Vallee, or even Crosby.
Practically, institutions are
strengthened by opposition and are
weakened by lack of virile competi
tion. And actually, if an institution
can't stand the verbal bombast of a
few men—even a few men like
Trotsky—who wants the institution
anyway? It is probably so shaky and
insecure that even the,most stolid
should have acute jitters.
On second thought, maybe the op
position to Einstein is due to rabid
v/ets who feel that his ancestors
were not whole-hearted anti-drys.
Aftey all, Einstein DOES mean one
stein. There is no placating these
wets. —Abe Mellinkoff

would probably accept a speaking
engagement in this country.
He is one of the figures of the
century and it would really be ah
educational asset to have the Old
Boy come over here under some
body's auspices. I would like to see
the self-made general and states
man. I don't like communism and I
wouldn't exactly choose Trotsky for
a roommate or a fourth at bridge—
but it surely would be entertaining
to hear him, and instructive as
well.
And what harm could he possibly
d othe myth that all communists
carry bombs under their beards
being exploded with the introduc
tion of Gillette unto Russia? He
might convei't a few weak-willed
incipient dementia cases who could
be converted to anything by any
body with an emotionat appeal —
Mussolini, Prince of Wales, Rudy
Vallee, or even Crosby.
Practically, institutions are
strengthened by opposition and are
weakened by lack of virile competi
tion. And actually, if an institution
can't stand the verbal bombast of a
few men—even a few men like
Trotsky—who wants the institution
anyway? It is probably so shaky and
insecure that even the,most stolid
should have acute jitters.
On second thought, maybe the op
position to Einstein is due to rabid
v/ets who feel that his ancestors
were not whole-hearted anti-drys.
Aftey all, Einstein DOES mean one
stein. There is no placating these
wets. —Abe Mellinkoff
Some 'America-First -And-Only"
society is attempting to prevent Mr.
Albert Einstein from entering these
merry United States. The terrible
charge is that the gentleman is af
filiated with the evil and sinister
forces of communism and anarchism.
Mr. Einstein is of course remem
bered as the world's No. 1 Relativity
Man and probably the only 'mathe-
matician in the world to be wel
comed by the Master of Welcomers,
the late lamented Mayor of New
York—Jimmie Walker. Either ac
complishment is sufficient to make
a man famous. Einstein has both.
These well-meaning women who
are seeking to rob Princeton of its
famous educational, scoop fear that
the mighty ideals and institutions of
this nation will be endangered by a
little, shy, retiring scientist. It is
clear that Einstein will do little over
here but lecture on his subject, give
out an interview or so monthly, and
run some well-rosined horse hairs
ever his fiddle strings.
If that constitutes a menace to the
foundations of this country, it is
high time to pack up everything and
sail for Mars or maybe even Jupiter.
Why is it that those who claim to
be the most boisterous boosters for
this government of ours, quake the
most at every ripple of antagonism
to it? Especially, when everyone
knows that 12,000,000 unemployed
constitute more of a menace than
62 Einsteins.
In fact, Einstein is so harmless
that only the most rabid, narrow
minded, high blood-pressured "pa
triots" could object to this inoffen
sive little man. Many more might
object to a communist of the blood
and-thunder type like Trotzky be

ing admitted to this country for a
speaking tour. Personally, I think it
would be a great idea. And Trotsky
being unemployed at the moment,
would probably accept a speaking
engagement in this country.
