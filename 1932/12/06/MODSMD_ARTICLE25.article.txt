The Editor, Sir:
OLD IRONSIDES
(Apologies to Holmes)
Ay, polish that historic blade!
Long has its edge prevailed,
And many an eye has danced to see
The rusty steel unveiled;
Beneath it rung the Berkeley shout,
And burst the Bruin's roar;
The Redman's ancient tomahawk
Shall sweep the stands no more.
Taken from home in 'ninety-nine,
Ensnared for thirty years,
Sought by unnumbered Cardinal
bands,
Now again the iron rears
Only to meet a dismal end
To fierce and storied days,
Adorned and burnished like a toy
Decked out for public gaze.
Who now shall know the glorious
past
The cherished weapon saw?
The harpies of committees gloss
Tradition stark and raw.
Oh, better that its battered blade
To Cal be given back,
Than rouged and lipsticked here and
there
And plastered on a plaque!
—Jack Jc-rnegan, '33
—Howard Moore, '31
Addendum: In case the poetic
frenzy of the authors of this mas
terpiece has Somewhat obscured their
point, they wish to make it clear
that they heartily approve of the
use of the axe as a trophy, but they
consider it distinctly inappropriate
to paint out its scars and finish it
off with a gilded handle.
