"CHICAGO —When a dentist uses
two or three instruments on your
teeth, don't shudder. You haven't
seen anything yet, for there are
really 6,000 items in the full kit of
the profession."—S.F. Chronicle.
Doctor, you can swing that mallet.
For the blow won't make me chill.
And I'll overlook that chisel.
But, man. PLEASE lay oIT that
drill!
Really, I don't mind that pipe
wrench
When those upper teeth you fill.
But I plead with you and beg you
Won't you please lay OFF that
drill!!
True, that hatchet there will never
Raise a primal "urge to kill"
And those sledges come in handy
But, sir. please lay off that DRILL!
You can jab me with that ice pick
And I'll lie here calm and still;
You can even saw my molars
Oh, hut PLEASE lay OFF that
DRILL!!
