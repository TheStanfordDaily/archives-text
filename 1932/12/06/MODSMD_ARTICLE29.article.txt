TROUBLE IN PARADISE (Para
mount). At the Stanford Theatre.
The direction of Ernst Lubitsch,
which became a burlesque of itself
in "One Hour with You," returns
to its usual high level in this pic
ture. Aided by an especially good
and appropriate story, brilliant dia
logue, and a cast of uniform excel
lence, the direction makes this pic
ture a genuine work of art.
Probably the best acting was by
Miriam Hopkins, but this was main
ly because she had the best oppor
tunities. Herbert Marshall, an Eng
lish actor not yet familiar to Ameri
can audiences, played with remark
able smoothness and assurance. C.
Aubrey Smith, Charles Ruggles, and
"Edward Everett Horton, all excel
lent comedians, had little to do but
played bits excellently. Thare was
weak spot in the cast.
But the chief factor in this pic
ture's success is Lubitsch's direc
tion. His story was comedy, at times
approaching fantasy, and was di
rected accordingly. The perform
ance moves with a quiet grace that
Lubitsch himself has never before
achieved. —Zimansky
