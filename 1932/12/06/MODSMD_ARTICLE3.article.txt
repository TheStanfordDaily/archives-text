an early game this season, watching his Red Machine in action.


Above photo shows Warner with Ernie Nevers, a possible successor (o the post he vacated, and whom
he described as "the best athlete I have ever coached in all my years at football." Nevers, now assistant
varsity coach, is reported to he a candidate for "Pop's" place. His chief hacking conies from ;t group of
Stanford alumni in Los Angeles. Press service bulletins slate that a meeting may be held by the southern
grads tomorrow to organize a movement to install Nevers.
