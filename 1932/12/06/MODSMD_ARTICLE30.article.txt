With seven lettermen returning,
Stanford's varsity basketball squad
under Coach John Bunn is rapidly
rounding into shape for the coming
barnstorming trip through the Mid
west which opens December 22.
The five monogram winners who
have been working out since Octo
ber were strengthened last v/eek by
the return ol Jay Tod and Dave
Packard from the football squad.
However, according to Coach Bunn,
it is doubtful that all of the letter
men available will be included in
the squad of 10 which will make
the Christmas vacation trip due to
the brilliant showing made by sev
eral former fresh and transfers.
Guard is the position with the
greatest number of experienced
players returning. In 'addition to
Tod, Hancock and Cosgrove won
letters last year while Edelen di
vided his time between guard and
center. Mack is a former frosh star.
Cordry and Palmer are the only
returning lettermen at forward but
are backcd up by Coiner and Page,
ex-frosh, and Glasgow. If eligible,
Topping will be a welcome addition
to the ranks.
Packard is the only center return
ing for duty with the passing of Bill
Doub with whom he divided first
string honors last season. Edelen
will probably understudy the for
mer, giving the tip-off position
plenty of strength.
