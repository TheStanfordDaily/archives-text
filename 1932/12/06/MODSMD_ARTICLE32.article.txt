# Meier Lops .2 Second Off Own High Hurdle Record
## 
### 
Another pre-season record fell in
yesterday's practice when Gus Meier
ran the 120-yard high hurdle path
in time equal to the Big Meet rec
ord for that event. The time, 14.8
seconds, betters Meier's best record
for this autumn's practice by two
tenths of a second.
Cotto Herbert followed the win
ner and pushed him but finished
about three yards behind. Meier, in
his hurry to better his previous good
time, knocked down two barriers.
Immediately after this dash Herbert
and Meier repeated the event with
the same finishing line-up but this
time Meier was clocked at 14.9.
Even at this speed he tipped only
one of the obstructions.
