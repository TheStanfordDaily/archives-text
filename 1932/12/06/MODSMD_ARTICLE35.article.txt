- THE RESIGNATION OF POP |
WARNER, after the nth successive I
year of December rumors, came as j
a distinct shock to most people, not I
because the idea was new to them, j
but because they never dreamed that
the wolves could get the Old Man I
down sufficiently to make hifn re- j
sign.
And now that the aforemen
tioned wolves have had their l
way. they can appoint their own
coach—maybe—and then tear
him down, too, when they dis
cover that maybe Stanford's
late-lamented s<jason was not
entirely Warner's fault.
These comer-quarterbacks who
are predicting that the Indians are
in for their best, season in history
next year, give us a full-fledged j
laugh.
WE HAVE GONE ALL OVER l
this before, but there still seem to '
be bright boys who can't get it j
through their heads.
The Stanford babes beat the
U.S.C. freshmen badly, and were
held to a tie by the Bear Cubs—
granted. But did you ever real- J
ize that NINE of the Tro-babes 1
didn't get to play against Stan
ford because our agreement with
them is different from their pact
with California?
All that those boys have to do, to ;
be eligible next year, is get a C j
average. And the majority of them ;
will be able to do that without trou- |
ble, NOT because S.C.'s require-1
ments are low, but because Troy '
has so much chance to choose its J
material that it has been getting in !
boys with brains as well as brawn.
If you don't believe this, drop a line
South and ask them what their re
quirements are.
* * *
WE ARE STILL CONVINCED
that Stanford's freshman team is a
better team than the California Cub
outfit, but wo still do not claim that
it is a vastly better outfit.

In addition, with all due re
spect to the cherubs who went
to make up this year's squad,
there are bound to be some
fhinkouts, and there arc bound
I to be some injuries, and when
all is said and done there will
not be too many of the Class of
j 193fi on the varsity football team
when it trots out on the turf
next fall. If six of the baby Red
shirts see action next fall, it will
be very satisfactory.
So, although the material that is
graduating to the varsity may be the
best in umpty-ump years, don't for
get the lean years to which you are
comparing it.
: AND FOR THE GENTLEMAN
| whose shoes we should least like to
j be filling at this moment, allow us
! to nominate Mr. Ernest Nevers.
Ernie has from the very be
ginning been loyal to Pop. He
has never taken any part in the
debates which have eddied
about his blond brow since he
came here—for the second time,
j The wolves have asked all the
l questions and they have given till
! the answers. And now that Pop is
I going, they aren't so sure that their
j hunch was right. Bob Wade
