Alonzo Stagg today said he was
through at the University of Chi
cago and would not accept the posi- ,
tion of chairman of the university's j
committee on intercollegiate ath- j
letics.
The 70-year-old football coach j
and director of athletics at the Mid
way made his announcement when |
informed that he would not be re
tained as coach next year.
"I could not accept a job without
work," he explained in turning
down the chairmanship. "I am fit,
willing and able and refuse to be
idle and merely a nuisance, as I
would be if I ?ccepted this position.
I must have work to do and since
I 'can not be football coach, I am
leaving the university."
