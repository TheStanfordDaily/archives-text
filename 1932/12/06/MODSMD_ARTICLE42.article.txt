### 
Showing examples of handcraft
by both the natives and the civilized
inhabitants, Miss Olive Meacham
yesterday spoke to the Y.W.C.A.
International Committee on life and
customs in Liberia.
Miss Meacham, who is head of a
missionary school near Monrovia, is
well acquainted with the two dif
ferent classes of society in the
countryâ€”the native majority and
the more or less civilized and
racially distinct group of some 600,-
000 descendants of freed American
slaves who emigrated to the country
in the early part of the nineteenth
century.
Knute Rockne used to insist on
dancing lessons for the members of
his team.
