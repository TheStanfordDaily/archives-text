# INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE BALKS ON PAY LIMIT FOR MINOR CLUB BALL PLAYERS
## 
### 
COLUMBUS. 0., Dcc. 5 (A 3 )—' The j
I proposed salary limit for minor!
league baseball players apparently j
struck its first snag today when the ,
International circuit adjourned its S
annual meeting without taking any j
definite action on fixing payrolls. j
The International League meeting :
was held in conjunction with the
National Association of Professional
: Baseball Leagues, whose executive j
I committee has proposed a salary i
i limit of $6500 a month. This figure !
j has already been adopted by the |
I American Association.
Player Market at Low
The player market, which is usu- '
j ally brisk when the minor leagues
! gather, reached a new low when no
I important sales were announced.
The International several weeks
ago went on record as favoring a
■ limit of $44,500 a year, with eighteen

players as the maximum number
carried. This runs approximately
$2000 higher than the executive
committee's recommendation.
Immediately after the Interna
tional meeting adjourned the club
owners went into session with the
American Association magnates to!
discuss the salary matter.
Coast Clubs Apathetic
The Pacific Coast League also was
invited to attend the meeting, but
officials of that group said the Coast
League was not interested in fixing I
a salary or player limit.
Charles T. Knapp of Baltimore'
was re-elected president of the In
ternational League for one year and
Warren Giles of Rochester again
was selected as vice-president. Wil- 1
liam J. Manley was re-elected sec- J
retary and treasurer for a three? j
year term.
