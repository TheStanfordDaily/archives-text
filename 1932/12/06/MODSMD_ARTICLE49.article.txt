# U.S.C. CAGE SQUAD PREPARES FOR 1932 RACE; LOOKS GOOD
## Coach Sam Barry To Have Two Strong Squads, Many Stars 
### 
While King Football is preparing
to descend from his high throne o[
public attention, and while the spot
light of sport slowly shifts to bas
ketball, coaches at the University
of Southern California are losing no
time in organizing their cage forces
for the 1933 campaign, which from
all indications should be a very
successful one.
Although two of Coach Sam
Barry's best performers are still
running around in moleskins for
Howard Jones, it appears at this
writing that the Trojans could M've
a pretty good account of themselves
even without the air of these two
men: Julie Bescos, a guard, and
Bob Erskine, giant center.
For the first time in his life, Barry
will be met with the pleasant situa
tion of having two quintets which
are equally as strong as each other.
Lettermen for every position are
returning this year, as well as the
members of last year's brilliant and
undefeated l'rosh team. Many
claimed last year that the frosh
could whip the varsity any day of
the week, and it seems their con
tention has been partly proven as
three sophomores hold down regu
lar berths so far this year.
The offensive will be built around
Jerry Nemer, the colorful, high
scoring forward, who is primed for
the greatest basketball season of his
career. For the other forward posi
tion, the leading candidates are
Ernie Holbrook, Sax Elliott, and
Nate Halperin.
The center post will be hotly con
tested between Lee Gutero and
Fuzzy Foss, with Erskine a possible
third man, although he intends to
report at guard. The guard roster of
Joe Kelley, Hop Finley, Sonny An
derson, and Bob Fuhrer, completes
the squadâ€”one of the greatest po
tential teams in coast history.
