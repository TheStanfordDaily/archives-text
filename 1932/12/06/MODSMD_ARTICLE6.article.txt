# 'Literal Enforcement' Fiat Okehs Delta Chi Rushing
## 
### 
Literal interpretation by the In- |
terfraternity Board of Control of the;
rule concerning the penalty for il- |
legal rushing will be applied to the 1
Delta Chi's, giving them the right j
of making contacts with freshmen')
but withholding pledging privileges ;
until January, 1934, it was decided
iast night.
The rule as il stands in the origi- !
nal version has never been applied
before this case and is as follows: j
"No Lower Division"
"Any house involved in illegal j
rushing shall not pledge any mem- i
ber of the lower division entering j

I the University for the first time in
; the school year in which the illegal
! rushing occurred until one year
j from the pledging day in such school
| year and the rushee or rushees in
| volved in the illegal rushing shall
j not pledge any house for the same
period provided that the penalty
| may be modified if the Board is
I convinced that circumstances war
rant it."
Amendment Needed
While the literal interpretation
; will apply to the Delta Chi's, the
I Board feels that an amendment is
| necessary for future cases. The

amendment is worded to include
rushing privileges ;is well ns pledg
ing. It was also provided that the
denial of pledging and rushing
privileges shall also include the de
nial of permission to the lower divi
sion men to move into the fraternity
house.
Ike Livermore, Board chairman,
stated that the feeling in the Board
took the stand that since the penalty
h;id never been applied before it
would be unfair to Delta Chi to
read into the rule any interpretation
cxcept a literal one of the words
themselves, although rushing as well
as pledging was implied when the
rule was drawn up.
