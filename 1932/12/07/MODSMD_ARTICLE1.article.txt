# HOOVER SILENT ON BEER, ASKS TAX ON SALES
## Senate Listens In Silence To Address Reading, House In Turmoil PAY CUT SCHEME HIT President And Democrats Agree On Banking 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (/P) —
President Hoover told Congress to
day how he thought the budget
might best be balanced and the Na
tion restored to prosperity, recom
mending a general sales tax with
wholesale governmental economies
and particularly emphasizing re
form of the banking laws.
His proposal, submitted in his last
annual message to Congress, re
ceived a varied reception among the
members, ranging from warm praise
to sharp criticism and indifference.
Silent on Prohibition
The Senate put on its best man
ners to hear a reading clerk drone
out paragraph after paragraph of
the communication, which, many
prohibition-minded members were
quick to note, made no reference to
legalizing and taxing beer.
The House, meanwhile, paid little
attention as the message was read
there. The legislators milled about
the floor, conversing in low but
audible tones. At the end it received
scattered applause from the Repub
lican side.
Battle on Pay Cut
A good many were inclined to
look askance at the sales tax pro
posal, which aroused a bitter fight
and eventually was defeated last
year. A recommendation for a Fed
eral pay roll cut averaging 14.8 per
cent was also regarded as the fore
runner of a battle.
The Democratic leadership, soon
to take full command of the Govern
ment, heard the Hoover proposals
and went ahead with its own plans
to place a tax on legalized beer as
a means, with economies, of balanc-"
ing the budget..
There was general agreement be
tween Mr. Hoover and the Demo
crats on the necessity for banking
leform, and action seemed in pros
pect to bring this • about at this
session.
