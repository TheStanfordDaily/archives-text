# Invite '500' To Hockey Dinner
## 
### 
Tomorrow is the big day for the
athletically inclined women of the
University. The W.A.A. has sched
uled its hockey banquet for 6:15 to
morrow night in the Stanford Union.
All women, whether members of the
hockey teams or not, are invited to
attend.
Members of the ail-star hockey
team will be announced, and ath
letic awards will be made to those
women who have the required num
ber of points. Six hundred points
are needed for a circls S, 100 for a
block S, and 1400 for a blanket.
Those women who are eligible for
one of the foregoing awards should
report to Louise Hudson at once.
After the dinner there will be
short speeches, and a short skit pre
sented by members of each class
team. The skits will probably em
body take-offs on the relative play
ing ability of the teams, and the
peculiarity which characterizes each
team.
