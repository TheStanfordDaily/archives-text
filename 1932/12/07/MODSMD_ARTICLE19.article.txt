# BURTON DECRIES PRESENT ORDER
## Says White Race Doomed If Change Is Not Made 
### 
"There is only one change neces
sary—and that is a total change.
Another war will probably mean
the end of all war as far as we are
concerned. We have plenty of every
thing except intelligence," These
are the statements with which Eng
lish lecturer, John Burton, drama
tically and profoundly impressed the
Stanford Assembly Hall audience
last night.
With an appeal to the individual
to face the problems of the real
crisis, John Burton stated that un
less a more equitable distribution of
wealth is effected—and rapidly ef
fected—the present position of the
white race is doomed.
"The challenge today is a chal
lenge of personal values." Said Bur
ton, "What do you want? A per
sonal aggrandizement for a few
years and then a worse period of
confusion than the present, or do
you want an intelligent reorienta
tion of our system."
Stressing that international co
operation must be the way of the
world, the speaker declared: "World
peace and international competition
are utterly divigerent. You may
have one or the othei*, but never
both. Constant international com
petition keeps us from peace."
"Economy essentially means
equality! The wants of men are
fundamentally equal. But in Eng
land at the present time, there is
never enough money in circulation
to purchase that which is produced.
And it is not to the advantage of
any one individual to have another
individual starve."
As indicative of the present op
portunist attitude, Burton told of a
meeting several months ago with a
New York business man. Burton
quoted the man as saying: "I hope
to God that Roosevelt is elected,
that another boom of prosperity re
turns, and that I may die in the
middle of it."
"Individual honesty and world
citizenship are the ultimate hopes
of the world."
