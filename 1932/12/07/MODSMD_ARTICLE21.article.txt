## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
The "500" is not blind to the ad- |
i vantages of blind dates.
This conclusion was reached yes- i
| terday after a survey exposing the j
| opinions of prominent women in
|,sororities.
Sally Rietveld, '34, Delta Gamma,
I stated: "I personally haven't found j
, any diamonds on blind dates, but ;
1 the world is full of interesting peo- ;
j pie, and you never can tell."
Eleanor Boyd, '33, Kappa Kappa |
I Gamma, said: "Blind dates appeal j
| to my adventurous spirit."
On the other hand, Janis Mc
' Creadie, '33, Delta Delta Delta, says: j
"My general opinion of a blind date !
is—high I.Q. and low S.Q. (social
I quotient)."
Mary Delia Callahan, '33, Pi Beta
Phi, has no opinion to offer, stating:
i "I don't know anything about it; I
haven't lived."
Nancy Jones, '33, Alpha Phi, says:
'Blind dates are on the whole ad
j visable, ii you know the promoter.

At times, they lead to engagements."
Madeleine Speik, '33, Kappa Al
pha Theta, agrees with Miss Jones,
replying: "Oh, my yes! I heartily
favor blind dates. Once when I 1
went —well, we won't go into that."
Janet Kempenich, '34, Gamma
Phi Beta, thinks it all depends on
the person and circumstances. "The
person is usually all right, but the
circumstances often not. Sometimes
enduring friendships are gained; I've
heard the other way, too."
Idamyrtle Klepinger, '34, Chi
Omega, thinks: "Blind dates are fun,
but very, very risky. Most girls like
to know something about the indi
vidual—see his Quad picture, or
know his general reputation."
Elearnor Furst, '33, Alpha Omic
ron Pi, believes: "Blind dates are a
grand idea, if the promoter is com
petent. It's best if they are arranged
by some mutual close friend; about
all that can be done in most cases
i: to match the heights."
