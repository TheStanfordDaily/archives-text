## Delegates Refuse Proposal For Immediate Cut At Geneva Parley 
### 
GENEVA, Switzerland, Dec. 6 (/P)
| â€”Proposals offered by the American
: delegation to the world disarma
! ment conference are in their present
form not acceptable to Germany,
I German delegates indicated shortly
i after statesmen from five leading
| nations resumed their conversations
this afternoon.
The suggestion known as the
Davis plan is based on the "neces
! sity for immediate' action" and ad
vances the idea of a convention
dealing exclusively with disarma
ment. It proposes to scale down
arms immediately and provide a
permanent commission to work out
I the details of security, equality, and
other points.
Asks For Elucidation
Baron von Neurath, the German
delegate, however, before express
| ing definite opposition to the Davis
plan, asked for the elucidation of
j several points.
The German Foreign Minister
said he would transmit the propo
sals minutely. When the afternoon
j session was resumed he was accom
| panied by Dr. Frohwein, the Ger
-1 man delegation's technical expert
on disarmament.
Premier Mac Donald of England
and Premier Herriot of France left
i tonight for Paris.
It was their intention, it was
i learned from reliable authority, to
consider the debt problems which
confront both nations. Premier Mac-
Donald is due to return here Thurs
; day, and Premier Herriot on Sat
urday.
British Back Plan
The indications were that the
1 British and the Americans were the
only ones really sponsoring the
Davis plan as a whole. For Ger
many the objection was to the delay
| in according a status of equality in
| arms, and it was said that Italy
agreed with Germany.
j On the French side the obstacle
; was the absence of security guaran
| tees.
There was a British hint to the
French delegation that it might be
wise to adopt the Davis proposals
1 now and wait until alter March 4 in
the hope that guarantees of security
might receive support from the new
American administration.
