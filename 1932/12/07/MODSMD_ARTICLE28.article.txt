# Warner Tells Frosh Gridmen To Remain On Farm Next Year
## Yearling Stars Reconsider First Decision To Follow Old Fox To His Temple University Position; Babes Would Lose By Transfer 
### BOB WADE 
Stating that announcements made by outstanding members of Stanford's
freshman football team to the effect that tliey would follow him to Temple
University were undoubtedly the result of an initial bewilderment occa
sioned by his sudden withdrawal from the coaching staff. Coach l'op
|'Warner early yesterday urged the first-year men to stay at Stanford,
where he feels that conditions are much belter than they have been for
some time. Warner's statement followed those of several freshman stars

who declared that they had come to
Stanford to play under Pop and that
they intended to play under him
wherever he went.
First Opinions Hasty
Later in the day, after they had
had time to consider the question
more fully, the same freshmen de
clared that they realized that their
first statements were hasty opinions,
and that on second thought they
would probably remain at Stanford
to complete their college education.
Chief among the yearling leaders
who were reported to be leaving the
Farm were Bobby Grayson, reputed
Portland's greatest prep-school half
back, and Frank Alustiza, hard-hit
ting fullback from Stockton. These
two supposedly spoke for Johnny
Reisner, Earl Hoos, Woody Adams,
"Bones" Hamilton, and Bob Rey
nolds.
Babes Have Careers Here
Of the entire group, Hamilton is
the only one who has a logical rea
son for following the Old Fox on
the long trek East. He lives in
Pennsylvania, and therefore could
move into Philadelphia without very
much trouble.
General sentiment around the
campus, and in official circles was
to the effect that this year's baby
Redshirt outfit, having completed a
successful season, would be loathe
te break up at a time when a num
ber of its members have an excel
lent chance of stepping into posi
tions on the varsity of one outstand
ing universities in the country.
Transfer Itule Holds
If the freshmen should move to
Philadelphia, they would have 1Â«>
abide by the transfer rule which
prohibits athletic competition for
men coming from a four-year in
stitution for a period of one year.
In addition to this, they would have
to adjust their scholastic standing in
their new college, and it is felt that
the disadvantages of moving will
far outweigh the advantages of such
a change in the minds of the men
who are supposedly contemplating
the shift.
Yesterday's story was typical of
those that have followed every
change that any important coach in
Ihe country has made. But the ac
tual followings in the past have in
variably dwindled almost to insig
nificance by the time that the coach
arrived at his new school for spring
or fall practice the next succeeding
season.
