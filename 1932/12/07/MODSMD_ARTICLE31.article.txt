Yes, ;is the San Francisco papers so apllv pnl il the;
oilier day, the man hunt is on at Stanford. While the
Indian is slill recovering his hrealh from the shock he
got when His* Chief Warner moved to the happier hunting
grounds lie visualizes in Philadelphia, that same Indian is
beginning to worry about a new medicine man.
A new medicine man tor the Farm is a pretty big order, 1
and the wise Indian will be the Indian who is in no par-;
licular hurry to engage one. A manhunt, yes but let il
not be a manhunt of bowling bloodhounds and flaring
torches. Halhcr let il be a manhunt'of confidential cor
respondence, ol investigation ol records, a manhunt of
deliberation and carefulness. |
liighl now, when shock tit W arner's departure is only
overshadowed by worry about naming his successor, is no
time to name the man who will guide Stanford's gridiron
destiny. There have been no fewer Hum fifteen men sug-
as Pop Warner's successor. Kach of these men litis
his backers. Today the ever-important alumni possess,
.1 much more unsettled attitude toward the Stanford coach-j
ing situation than thev ever held during the recent Warneri
regime.
Kven the student body, always 100 per cent behind the j
Old Fox, possesses no unity on the question of who should
be Stanford's next coach. Any man, no matter how highly,
recommended, no matter how impressive his coaching rec
ord, would encounter greater dissatisfaction than Warner
ever encountered, were he to be named to the position at
this time.
The course of wisdom for the H.A.C.., with whom rests
the problem of naming the next Indian football chief, will
be to hike plenty of time in solving that problem. It will
be much belter for Stanford to be coachlcss from now
until next spring than to be poorly coached the following}
fall. ' '
Speculating as to what man would make the best coach
for Stanford makes a nice parlor game, all right, (lo
ahead and play it, but don't be dissatisfied with the 8.A.C..
if that body plays the game iu heads-lip manner and
doesn't rush into the football coach market brandishing a
contract on which Ihc ink is slill wet.

overshadowed by worry about naming his successor, is no
time to name the man who will guide Stanford's gridiron
destiny. There have been no fewer Hum fifteen men sug-
as Pop Warner's successor. Kach of these men litis
his backers. Today the ever-important alumni possess,
.1 much more unsettled attitude toward the Stanford coach-j
ing situation than thev ever held during the recent Warneri
regime.
Kven the student body, always 100 per cent behind the j
Old Fox, possesses no unity on the question of who should
be Stanford's next coach. Any man, no matter how highly,
recommended, no matter how impressive his coaching rec
ord, would encounter greater dissatisfaction than Warner
ever encountered, were he to be named to the position at
this time.
The course of wisdom for the H.A.C.., with whom rests
the problem of naming the next Indian football chief, will
be to hike plenty of time in solving that problem. It will
be much belter for Stanford to be coachlcss from now
until next spring than to be poorly coached the following}
fall. ' '
Speculating as to what man would make the best coach
for Stanford makes a nice parlor game, all right, (lo
ahead and play it, but don't be dissatisfied with the 8.A.C..
if that body plays the game iu heads-lip manner and
doesn't rush into the football coach market brandishing a
contract on which Ihc ink is slill wet.
Yes, ;is the San Francisco papers so apllv pnl il the;
oilier day, the man hunt is on at Stanford. While the
Indian is slill recovering his hrealh from the shock he
got when His* Chief Warner moved to the happier hunting
grounds lie visualizes in Philadelphia, that same Indian is
beginning to worry about a new medicine man.
A new medicine man tor the Farm is a pretty big order, 1
and the wise Indian will be the Indian who is in no par-;
licular hurry to engage one. A manhunt, yes but let il
not be a manhunt of bowling bloodhounds and flaring
torches. Halhcr let il be a manhunt'of confidential cor
respondence, ol investigation ol records, a manhunt of
deliberation and carefulness. |
