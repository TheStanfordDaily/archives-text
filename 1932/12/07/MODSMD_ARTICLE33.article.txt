# A 						RUSTY STORY
## 
### 
111 yesterday morning's campus opinion column, two
well-meaning students attacked the present plan of polish
ing the hlade of the Stanford Axe, 14iI< 1 inthe handle, and
mounting the weapon which is to become a HitÂ»' (lame
trophy. In poetry, it was, too, that they came out flatly in
favor of retaining the rust on the implement.
Now, after all, is not the true significance, tin 4 true
tradition, in the Axe itself, in the metal itself? One of the
purposes of making it a trophy is to bring it safely out in
the open where all can gaze upon the object that actually
carries the tradition.
Polishing the blade till the bright, cold steel is revealed
as it looked back in the "'.lll's 011 the day it was forged
obviously would bring to light that which holds the history
complete, from the day it began.
However, if a sufficient number of students feel as the
campus opinion-writing poets do, that we must retain
rust 011 the Axe at any cost, perhaps a compromise might
be arranged whereby only the most recently accumulated
outer layer could be scraped otV. revealing at least the more
historic rust.
