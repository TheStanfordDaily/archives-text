# BULL SESSION
## YAPPING JACKALS 
### 
Like an old lion, tired with end
less bickering and fighting, '"Pop"
Warner has finally answered the
yapping alumni jackals. Those
graduates who would gladly mort
gage the Memorial Church to make
a winning football team finally have
their way. The old lion could have
turned on his nipping adversaries
but he wouldn't. He was irked—dis
gusted—tired.
While other universities were ad
mitting freshman classes of almost
2,000 —Warner continued to turn out
splendid teams with just a fraction
of that material. While others sold
out educational standards for grid
iron glory, Stanford continued to
hold its scholastic record. And with
out favors or concessions from the
academic circle, Warner succeeded.
But the yapping remained and
grew. Some alumni wanted a blus
tering, flag-waving, chest- and back
thumping actor-coach. Glenn War
ner was a gentleman - quiet and re
served at all times. He raised foot
ball from a game of pure beef and
bone. He put flash and color into the
game. But he didn't always win. And
the purpose of football is to win.
And so the jackals continued their
nipping and yapping.
Pop Warner never tried to run
the University. He never tried to
remake the Universily system to
conform to football necessities as
some coaches are doing in their col
leges today. He never attempted to
become a Czar or Dictator. He was
football coach and he remained
football coach. But he lost some
games and those alumni who would

be happy to put training tables in
the President's Office wanted to win
—always. And so they nibbled at
Warner until he left.
And now the jackals are dancing
with glee. They have hounded "Pop"
cut of Stanford. Now, they feel a
new era will be born. It will be one
for all and all for football. l 'A win
ning team at all costs" will be their
battlecry. Hurrah and rah, rah will
echo through the Quad is their hope.
But tfcese alumni who return
yearly for the Big Game and the
S.C. fracas, and by so doing feel
that they hold their hand on the
pulse and wind-pipe of the Uni
versity, may be due for a big sur
prise. Ray Lyman Wilbur returns
to the Campus and he will probably
not sell out the University to any
group of football fans—whether they
come from Los Angeles or any other
place.
Southern California (the geo
graphic area) is the home of booster
ism. The virus exudes from every
nook and cranny. The very air is
infested. The disease will not be
transferred to the Campus despite a
few alumni. And in the end, the
dancing jackals will probably find
they have bitten off their own tails
—for it will be years till Stanford
will regain the football status it held
under Glenn S. Warner.
The whole problem is horribly
zoological. Whether the alumni in
question are wolves or jackals or
worse, we are not sure. The "Old
Fox" has left and his leaving is
lamented by almost all. That is cer
tain. —Abe Mellinkoff

but he wouldn't. He was irked—dis
gusted—tired.
While other universities were ad
mitting freshman classes of almost
2,000 —Warner continued to turn out
splendid teams with just a fraction
of that material. While others sold
out educational standards for grid
iron glory, Stanford continued to
hold its scholastic record. And with
out favors or concessions from the
academic circle, Warner succeeded.
But the yapping remained and
grew. Some alumni wanted a blus
tering, flag-waving, chest- and back
thumping actor-coach. Glenn War
ner was a gentleman - quiet and re
served at all times. He raised foot
ball from a game of pure beef and
bone. He put flash and color into the
game. But he didn't always win. And
the purpose of football is to win.
And so the jackals continued their
nipping and yapping.
Pop Warner never tried to run
the University. He never tried to
remake the Universily system to
conform to football necessities as
some coaches are doing in their col
leges today. He never attempted to
become a Czar or Dictator. He was
football coach and he remained
football coach. But he lost some
games and those alumni who would

be happy to put training tables in
the President's Office wanted to win
—always. And so they nibbled at
Warner until he left.
And now the jackals are dancing
with glee. They have hounded "Pop"
cut of Stanford. Now, they feel a
new era will be born. It will be one
for all and all for football. l 'A win
ning team at all costs" will be their
battlecry. Hurrah and rah, rah will
echo through the Quad is their hope.
But tfcese alumni who return
yearly for the Big Game and the
S.C. fracas, and by so doing feel
that they hold their hand on the
pulse and wind-pipe of the Uni
versity, may be due for a big sur
prise. Ray Lyman Wilbur returns
to the Campus and he will probably
not sell out the University to any
group of football fans—whether they
come from Los Angeles or any other
place.
Southern California (the geo
graphic area) is the home of booster
ism. The virus exudes from every
nook and cranny. The very air is
infested. The disease will not be
transferred to the Campus despite a
few alumni. And in the end, the
dancing jackals will probably find
they have bitten off their own tails
—for it will be years till Stanford
will regain the football status it held
under Glenn S. Warner.
The whole problem is horribly
zoological. Whether the alumni in
question are wolves or jackals or
worse, we are not sure. The "Old
Fox" has left and his leaving is
lamented by almost all. That is cer
tain. —Abe Mellinkoff
Like an old lion, tired with end
less bickering and fighting, '"Pop"
Warner has finally answered the
yapping alumni jackals. Those
graduates who would gladly mort
gage the Memorial Church to make
a winning football team finally have
their way. The old lion could have
turned on his nipping adversaries
but he wouldn't. He was irked—dis
gusted—tired.
