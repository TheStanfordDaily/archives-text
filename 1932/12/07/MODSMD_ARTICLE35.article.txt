I)1E PRIVATSEKKET A KIN (Tobis) .
—At the Varsity Theatre. . i
This picture avoids the fault of \
.stylization from which almost all J
German film operettas suffer. Con
sequently it has a spontaneity which i
carries it through in spite of a very
thin plot, average acting, and a i
musical score which, while not bad, !
hardly comes up to most
The comedy was not of a bad sort, i
arising chiefly from situation and I
characterization, unaided by bril- |
liant dialogue. Felix Bressart, a cross i
between Harpo Marx and Andy i
Gump, handled his comic role ox- j
ceptionally well, never appearing j
entirely unreal, and resisting the I
opportunity (which Hollywood would !
certainly have accepted) of renti- '
mentalizing his role. Renate Muller
and Herman Thimig as the leads
were adequate, but showed little of
either acting or singing ability. For
tunately, these were not much !
needed.
The direction, photography, set- t
tings, and recording were consist- j
ently mediocre. But in spite of all j
these faults the picture pleases be- I
cause of its light-heartedness and j
naturalness. Hollywood might learn j
from it (but will not) how to handle !
attempted seductions and drunk i
scenes without making them vulgar. !
—Zimansky j
PROSPERITY (MGM—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Grand old Marie Dressier again i
romps through another hilarious j
film with her old playmate, Polly j
Moran. II is in no way comparable j
to "Emma," lacking the humanness j
of that picture, but is noteworthy
for the gusto with which the two
leads perform. In "Prosper," Marie
shows how to round the famous j
Corner, and not without a series of!
situations which bring a large num
ber of well-earned laughs.
The story is a mixture of the
financial distress of the Warren j
Bank, owned by Marie Dressier and '
her son. and the
situation, which is doubly compli
cated by the fact that Marie's son !
marries Polly's daughter.
Originality is the feature of the
gags, and they are exceptionally
amusing. The picture opens with as
funny a wedding as was ever filmed;
but perhaps the best scene is that 1
In which the two dowagers both tip- ,
pear in Santa Claus costumes, to !
the chagrin of the son, who is al- ;
ready thus garbed. The final epi
sode is marred by bad taste, which
seems out of place in a film featur- I

I ing two such capable comediennes, |
I who need not rely on such devices;
I but it will draw a laugh just the
j same.
It is Miss Dressler's show, both by j
i reason of her stellar performance j
■ and the inherent sympathy of her |
i role, as contrasted with the nagging i
! Lizzie Praskins of Polly Moran.
' Marie is at her best in the serious
i mo. as, infusing her Maggie War-
I ren with splendid pathos as well as
j high comedy. Miss Mox-an's best
; moments are those of frank slap- j
j stick, and she makes the most of i
i them.
In the younger roles, Norman Fos- I
I ter and Anita Page impress favor
! ably, especially Foster, who is pleas
' ing despite his flaccid part.

Grand old Marie Dressier again i
romps through another hilarious j
film with her old playmate, Polly j
Moran. II is in no way comparable j
to "Emma," lacking the humanness j
of that picture, but is noteworthy
for the gusto with which the two
leads perform. In "Prosper," Marie
shows how to round the famous j
Corner, and not without a series of!
situations which bring a large num
ber of well-earned laughs.
The story is a mixture of the
financial distress of the Warren j
Bank, owned by Marie Dressier and '
her son. and the
situation, which is doubly compli
cated by the fact that Marie's son !
marries Polly's daughter.
Originality is the feature of the
gags, and they are exceptionally
amusing. The picture opens with as
funny a wedding as was ever filmed;
