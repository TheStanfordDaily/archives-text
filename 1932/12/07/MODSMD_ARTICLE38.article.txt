## ZERO WEATHER 
### BY OLD DR. ALGAR 
"Though they live in zero weather
1 most of the time, Eskimos catch cold
I easily, according to Colonel W. S.
j Van Dyke. He reported that when
j a camp is flooded and the natives
I get their feet wet, an epidemic of
; colds occurs."—S.F. Chronicle.
Sure, and others are alike
from here to there.
In the land of snow and ice
and polar bear,
When the young 'uns patter
forth in search of blubber
Eskimamas holler, "Johnnie,
where's your rubbers?"
BATTLE ON TO
SAVE COLLEGES
FOR TEACHERS
—S.F. Examiner
What about the $114 customers.
| don't they count?
