J cation is one of polite indifference,
j "My attitude toVvard college edu-
II am constantly (and a shade jeal
| ously) tweaked by an awareness of
| lack of it. Yet 1 maintain, the chief
asset is a cultural gloss, which
means little in getting on in the
world. Today, I talked to two ladies
turned out in high polish by fash
ionable schools here and abroad
They now are taking business
courses to obtain $30-a-week jobs.'
—O. O. Mclntyre.
I'll trade you a scat in a
college-class gallery
For half of one-fifth of your
Oscar-Odd salary.
"For forty-eight years I have been

making public speeches and 1 ha\e

have solved all the world's problems
time and time again and they still
go on Ik ing insoluble."—George
