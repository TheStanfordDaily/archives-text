# Transfers, Sophs Push Lettermen for Cage Berths
## TWO WEEKS TOUR SPURS HOOPSTERS IN FLOOR PRACTICE New Men Work Hard To Be Among Ten Who Will Play In Midwest 
### 
Transfers and ex-frosh have been
showing fla.shy cage play in compe
tition for the 10 places on the travel
ing Indian basketball squad, which
leaves December 22 on the first Card
barnstorming tour of the Midwest.
The seven returning lettermen on
Coach John Bunn's varsity outfit
will have to show plenty of fight to
repel the rising tide of new blood
threatening to grab train tickets for
the two weeks' practice trip.
Schnahel Good
An outstanding new casaba tosser
is Fred Schnabel, a center from San
Jose, who should push Dave Pack
ard and Hal Edelen for honors at the |
tip-ofT position. Clarence Stilleson, |
former San Mateo star, is one of the i
leading guard candidates who should ,
see plenty of action this season.
Another guard transfer is Gordon I
Daniels from the 1931 Sacramento j
J.C. quintet. Guards seem to be in !
abundance with John Mack, a for- ;
mer frosh, striving to displace the }
more experienced men. Three war- !
riors returned from cavorting on the j
gridiron, Walker, O'Connor, and I
Rovers having just turned out for i
the back court positions.
Ex-Frohh Back Forwards
Two more ex-frosh, A1 Page and j
Charlie Coiner, are performing at j
forward and give promise of de- j
veloping into a capable reserve pair ;
to back up Cordry and Topping, ,if i
the latter is eligible.
Jay Tod and Dave Packard, re- '
leased from football activity, re-1
turned to the floor game last week
to support the five other returning
lettermen who have been working
out all season. Cordry, Cosgrove,
Hancock, Edelen, and Palmer are ;
the cage candidates who can sport i
a block "S," won in previous sea- |
sons.
