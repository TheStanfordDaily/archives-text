# Seniors Downed 2-0 By Freshman Hockey Team
## 
### 
Assuming Stanford's jinx for the
1932 football season, the senior
women's hockey team, playing a
consistently better game than their
frosh opponents, was defeated, 2-0;
thus cinching the hockey champion
ship for the frosh.
Yesterday's game was by all odds
the best one played in the series
from the standpoint of teamwork
and team spirit. Outstanding stars
for the seniors were Betty Lev/ton,
who played her usual stellar de
fensive game, and Claire Nichols,
who was by all odds the best for
ward.
For the freshmen, Kitty Ahrens
played one of the best offensive
games of the year. 1 The frosh
strength is lodged mainly in its of
fense, not its defense.
