TIIE STANFORDS AND THE
CALIFORNIANS have both been
in need of. a coach in the last
year or two. and the Californias
rushed right out and got them
selves one without wasting any
time whatsoever, yes sir.
But down here on Palo Alto's
most famous Farm, they do say that
time will be taken out and the boys
who really have an opinion that is
worth hearing will be listened to
with rapt attention.
It would seem that at this most
auspicious moment, the timer
should also stop his watch for the
benefit of the Board of Athletic
stewards, which is maybe about to
decide that it was appointed for the
definite purpose of appointing in
turn a few men who would be sup
posed to know perhaps enough to
run the varsity marble team with
out aid from various charity or
ganizations to the north, south, east,
and west.
<;v 4>
IT SEEMS THAT SOME
MEDDLESOME people have
been so unkind as to hint that
the southern organizations are
composed of ex-chcer leaders,
who are popularly supposed not
to know anything anyhow, and
that they are still leading hum
cheers.
But of course this i.> hard to be
lieve because just last spring the
members of the Stanford Jockey
Club, southern branch, withdrew all
their scholarships so that Stanford
wouldn't be included in any more
subsidization reports, which they
realized might hurt the fair name
of the Club's alma mater, which
they love so dearly.
And besides, the head cheer lead
er has felt for some time that the
youth of the Farm has not been
basking in the proper influence, and
so for next year he has dug out that
ancient cheer known familiarly as
The Bronx, and it has had the effect
of changing the atmosphere.
BUT NOW THE WEATHER
MAN reports that there is a
storm brewing off the Coast, and

i it seems (hat maybe the Farm
will go in for making hay and
that there will be a bigger and
better Red Machine that will re
quire two drivers who will get
along beautifully without any
help from the Jockey Club.
And they even are whimpering it
about in some malicious quarters
that the Farm is going to get rid of
oil its horses, and that would be too
bad because it would leave the
Jockey Club members without any
' thing to ride, and that would be
i pretty tough on them, because they
have been going on long rides every
December for the last few years.
1 But they were too tough on the
\ good horses, so Stanford is going to
j get rid of all its blue-blooded
mounts.
IN ADDITION TO ALL these
conflicting reports, which leave •
the track followers pretty much
mixed up, there is one that says
that the northern branch of the
Jockey Club is pretty much
riled up against the southern
branch, because it seems that
three stewards of the northern
branch are on the Board of
Athletic stewards, and they
were put there to represent all
of the jockey clubs that have
been formed to show great ap
preciation of a fine alma mater.
And furthermore, the unkind peo
ple who are now running things on
the Farm, may decide that it is
about time that the southern branch
of the Jockey Clulp lay off the il
legal betting that has gone on lately,
because they haven't done very well
by themselves, and that is why they
have been trying to say which
horses should be run in the differ
ent races. And anyhow the Board of
Athletic Stewards was elected to
run things around the Farm, and
they are about to try it.—-R.D.W.Jr.

three stewards of the northern
branch are on the Board of
Athletic stewards, and they
were put there to represent all
of the jockey clubs that have
been formed to show great ap
preciation of a fine alma mater.
And furthermore, the unkind peo
ple who are now running things on
the Farm, may decide that it is
about time that the southern branch
of the Jockey Clulp lay off the il
legal betting that has gone on lately,
because they haven't done very well
by themselves, and that is why they
have been trying to say which
horses should be run in the differ
ent races. And anyhow the Board of
Athletic Stewards was elected to
run things around the Farm, and
they are about to try it.—-R.D.W.Jr.
TIIE STANFORDS AND THE
CALIFORNIANS have both been
in need of. a coach in the last
year or two. and the Californias
rushed right out and got them
selves one without wasting any
time whatsoever, yes sir.
But down here on Palo Alto's
most famous Farm, they do say that
time will be taken out and the boys
who really have an opinion that is
worth hearing will be listened to
with rapt attention.
It would seem that at this most
auspicious moment, the timer
should also stop his watch for the
benefit of the Board of Athletic
stewards, which is maybe about to
decide that it was appointed for the
definite purpose of appointing in
turn a few men who would be sup
posed to know perhaps enough to
run the varsity marble team with
out aid from various charity or
ganizations to the north, south, east,
and west.
<;v 4>
IT SEEMS THAT SOME
MEDDLESOME people have
been so unkind as to hint that
the southern organizations are
composed of ex-chcer leaders,
who are popularly supposed not
to know anything anyhow, and
that they are still leading hum
cheers.
But of course this i.> hard to be
lieve because just last spring the
members of the Stanford Jockey
Club, southern branch, withdrew all
their scholarships so that Stanford
wouldn't be included in any more
subsidization reports, which they
realized might hurt the fair name
of the Club's alma mater, which
they love so dearly.
And besides, the head cheer lead
er has felt for some time that the
youth of the Farm has not been
basking in the proper influence, and
so for next year he has dug out that
ancient cheer known familiarly as
The Bronx, and it has had the effect
of changing the atmosphere.
BUT NOW THE WEATHER
MAN reports that there is a
storm brewing off the Coast, and

i it seems (hat maybe the Farm
will go in for making hay and
that there will be a bigger and
better Red Machine that will re
quire two drivers who will get
along beautifully without any
help from the Jockey Club.
And they even are whimpering it
about in some malicious quarters
that the Farm is going to get rid of
oil its horses, and that would be too
bad because it would leave the
Jockey Club members without any
' thing to ride, and that would be
i pretty tough on them, because they
have been going on long rides every
December for the last few years.
1 But they were too tough on the
\ good horses, so Stanford is going to
j get rid of all its blue-blooded
mounts.
IN ADDITION TO ALL these
conflicting reports, which leave •
the track followers pretty much
mixed up, there is one that says
that the northern branch of the
Jockey Club is pretty much
riled up against the southern
branch, because it seems that
