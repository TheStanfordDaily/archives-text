# Jones Orders Light Practice
## S.C. Squad Eases Up Before Notre Dame Contest 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. G (^P)â€”Fear
; that his University of Southern Cali
j fornia football squad might become
] stale if given too much work in
! preparation for its game with Notre
j Dame here Saturday caused Coach
! Howard Jones to ease up on practice
! chores today.
j Word filtered from behind the
locked gates of Troy that the work-
J out this afternoon did not include
! even so much as dummy scrimmage
| and although the drill was brief,
I Coach Jones let it be known that
i the remaining practice sessions
| would be even shorter.
The chances are strong now that
j there will be no workout at all the
| day before the game. Coach Jones,
,in cutting down on the practice
| schedule, chose what he believes is
I the lesser of two evils, for some of
the players have a tendency of put
i ting on too much weight when work
; isn't meted out in large doses.
Continued repoi'ts of the influenza
j epidemic aboard the Notre Dame
, train en route here ' have not af
fected the Trojans. The entire team
continues to move along without
serious injury or illness, and all
hands are inclined to be a bit du
j bious about any word concerning
the dire condition of the Ramblers.
There has been no indication of
recent days as to what the trend of
the secret workouts has been in re
gard to the Trojans' plans for of
-1 fense or defense, but some are in
; clined to believe Coach Jones has
been priming his team for an aerial
battle.
From wounds received during the
! battle of Gallipoli in 1915, J. L. La
i Fontaine has just died in an Eng-
I lish hospital.
