## Daily Scribe Names Tongue-Twisters For National Football Honors 
### Howard Carr 
Now that the 1932 football season
| i:-> practically a thing of the past,
! and the time for the annual deluge
of all-American selections is with
I us; once more, the writer hereby
S presents the first team of its kind
j to appear—the most un-all-Ameri
j can eleven in the country:
Hokuf, End, Nebraska
Uzdavinis, Tackle, Fordham
I Janecek, Guard, Purdue
Hedtke, Center, Illinois
Gottschalk, Guard, Northwestern
Pivarnik, Tackle, Notre Dame
Suhrheinrich, End, Vanderbilt
| Pacetti, Quarter, Wisconsin
Muczynski, Half, Washington
Pepelnjak, Half, Oregon
| Regeczi, Full, Michigan
Imagine, if you can, what men
like Ted Husing or Graham Mc-
Namee could do to a list of names
I like that for a starting line-up. It
I is rumored that the players theni
! selves prefer to go by their first
j names—and do you blame the poor
fellows?
However, lest the reader might
• disapprove of having his football
| teams represent so many different
nations, and just to increase the
I headache he received from the above
; group, a second, or alternate, squad
is picked, which is indeed an out
j standing team. (In more ways than
i one, too.)
Lazarevich, End, Washington
Richavich, Tackle, Columbia
Steponovich, Guard, St. Mary's
I Sayatovich, Center, Montana
Keckich, Guard, Indiana
Antoncich, Tackle, Washington
Deanovich, End, Wisconsin
Frankovich, Quarter, U.C.L.A.
Jaskwhich, Half, Notre Dame
Jindrich, Half, Northwestern
Melinkovich, Full, Notre Dame
Now put Mike Pecarovich in there
as coach of this team and you have
the best Siberian team ever known
—at least it's known.
A total of 540,433 telephones was
