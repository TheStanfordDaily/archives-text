# MITCHELL ASKS HOUSE TO RUSH BILL FOR BEER
## Attorney General Afraid Of Loss In Respect For National Law HOOVER MAY USE VETO Brewers Urge Legislation Of 3.2 Per Cent Beer 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (/P) —
Change the prohibition laws quickly
if you're going to change them at
all, was the advice sent to Congress
today by Attorney General Mitchell
co-incidentally with testimony from
the brewing industry urging legisla
tion of 3.2 per cent beer.
Without indicating his personal
attitude, the Justice Department
chief said in his annual report:
"The changes, if any, should be
made as quickly as possible," and
"through amendment of substan
tive law" to prevent a breakdown
in respect for law.
Meanwhile Senate Democrats in
conference placed prohibition repeal
and Volstead law modification on
their legislative program for the
short session.

Levi Cooke of Washington and
R. A. Huber of St. Louis, repre
senting the United States Brewers'
Association, estimated that on the
basis of beer consumption in 1914,
the $5 a barrel tax would return
$330,945,000 a year. Both urged the
tax be kept low so that the indus
try might recover from years of
idleness under prohibition.
It has been reported that if a
beer bill is passed, President Hoover
would refuse to sign it.
At the outset of the hearing,
Collier explained that the 2.75 per
cent alcoholic content and $5 a
barrel tax provided in the Demo
cratic bill was a working basis,
adding "the committee will decide
what is to be the tax and alcoholic
content." It would be considered
separate from any other tax bill
that might be proposed, he an- 1
nounced, in limiting testimony to
four days for beer advocates and
two for prohibitionist organizations.
Stating that laws should not be
left on the statute books to be
scuttled by refusal to appropriate
money for their enforcement, At
torney General Mitchell added:
"It is evident that the present
state of the public mind will make
the task the officers of the law
doubly difficult and increase break
down and disrespect for the law
unless changes which are to be
made are made speedily."

co-incidentally with testimony from
the brewing industry urging legisla
tion of 3.2 per cent beer.
Without indicating his personal
attitude, the Justice Department
chief said in his annual report:
"The changes, if any, should be
made as quickly as possible," and
"through amendment of substan
tive law" to prevent a breakdown
in respect for law.
Meanwhile Senate Democrats in
conference placed prohibition repeal
and Volstead law modification on
their legislative program for the
short session.
Sees $300,000,000 Aid
Levi Cooke of Washington and
R. A. Huber of St. Louis, repre
senting the United States Brewers'
Association, estimated that on the
basis of beer consumption in 1914,
the $5 a barrel tax would return
$330,945,000 a year. Both urged the
tax be kept low so that the indus
try might recover from years of
idleness under prohibition.
It has been reported that if a
beer bill is passed, President Hoover
would refuse to sign it.
At the outset of the hearing,
Collier explained that the 2.75 per
cent alcoholic content and $5 a
barrel tax provided in the Demo
cratic bill was a working basis,
adding "the committee will decide
what is to be the tax and alcoholic
content." It would be considered
separate from any other tax bill
that might be proposed, he an- 1
nounced, in limiting testimony to
four days for beer advocates and
two for prohibitionist organizations.
Stating that laws should not be
left on the statute books to be
scuttled by refusal to appropriate
money for their enforcement, At
torney General Mitchell added:
"It is evident that the present
state of the public mind will make
the task the officers of the law
doubly difficult and increase break
down and disrespect for the law
unless changes which are to be
made are made speedily."
