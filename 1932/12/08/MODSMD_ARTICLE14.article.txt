### SILVIA ANN COWELL 
Sound health, common intellectual
interests, and common religious be
liefs are the prerequisites of a suc
cessful marriage, stated Dr. D.
Charles Gardner, University Chap
lain, in an interview yesterday.
"The philosopher may marry his
cook," remarked Dr. Gardner, "but
obviously, that is not a true mar
riage."
The chaplain recognizes the place
of passion in the relationship of
marriage, but it must be subordinate
to love and companionship, if the
marriage is to be permanent.
"The ideal marriage contemplates
a family," said Dr. Gardner.
According to the old-fashioned
theory, the father is the provider,
hul it is also possible to conserve

I
| marriage by the joint economic ef- i
1 forts of the husband and wife.
Dr. Gardner is optimistic as to the 1
i future of marriage as a social in- i
stitution. He does not regard the
present economic situation as a per- ,
manent hindrance.
"In the meanwhile," said the |
: chaplain, "I believe that sensible i
young Americans will be willing to |
1 marry and live simply. Happiness
rests upon loyalty, unselfishness, and |
affection, rather than on abundance
of possessions.
"The way of a man with a maid
iis still one of the charming mys
i teries of life. The family must long
continue the basis of the state and
j nation, and marriage is one of the
j rich joys of human experience." j
