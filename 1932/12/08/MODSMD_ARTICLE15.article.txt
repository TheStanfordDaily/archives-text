# GRID MENTOR MUST PLEASE STAFF, TEAM
## Dick Barrett, B.A.C. Head, Declares Harmony Will Govern Choice

i "What I want to get is the coach
! who most nearly meets the desires
'of the present team members and
recent graduates from the Stanford
squad," Richard W. Barrett, chair
man of the Board of Athletic Con
j trol, speaking.
"At the same time we must try
to get harmony in a situation like
j the present, and therefore, I will
| give serious consideration to the
I wishes of all alumni groups and
! faculty members."
B.A.C. Agrees
| These are the views that Barrett
I expressed yesterday, stating that he
; believes that the other alumni raem
j bers of the Board, Frank Guerena
; and Palmer Fuller, Jr., feel the
j same way.
Players and former players of the
! Warner regime are in the best po-
I sition to know what the conditions
are, and what the situation requires,
J according to the B.A.C. chairman.
It's their football team, he says, and
j their opinions should weigh heavily
with the selectors.
Students Heard
, This does not mean, however, that
j student voices will go unheard, when
I the evidence is finally sifted. Barrett
j expressed his willingness to listen
| to any constructive student sugges
j tions at any time, and from any
! quarter.
Tonight's meeting of the Board
I will provide opportunity for dis
| cussion of the coaching problem,
I but no definite decision will be
! reached on a successor for War
ner. Probably a special meeting will
!be called shortly after Christmas,
land it is hoped that the matter will
! be settled then.
Alumni Opinion Sought
i Although General Manager A1
1 Masters made a flying trip to Los
1 Angeles yesterday in order to sound
alumni opinion at a gathering last
I night, the Board wants more time
; to hear from the various factions.
Masters will return in time for to
j night's conclave here.
Sentiment in Northern California
is massing behind the "Thornhill
for-coach" movement, with Herb
j Fleishhacker, Jr. and Donald "Mush"
I Muller the latest recruits. Muller,
i captain in 1929, and Fleishhacker,
j star quarterback of the same team,
wrote Barrett yesterday advocating
| Tiny's elevation, with Ernie Nevers
j as chief assistant.

j their opinions should weigh heavily
with the selectors.

I the evidence is finally sifted. Barrett
j expressed his willingness to listen
| to any constructive student sugges
j tions at any time, and from any
! quarter.
Tonight's meeting of the Board
I will provide opportunity for dis
| cussion of the coaching problem,
I but no definite decision will be
