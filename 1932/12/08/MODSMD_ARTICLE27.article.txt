# SO IT'S YOUR BEAGLE, MR. GREGORY

Reports from the north to the effect that the editor of
the Oreyon Daily Emerald, student publication of the
t . of 0., had charged coast colleges in general with hiring
foolhall players, and Stanford in particular with paying
its grid stars $(>0 per month in cold, cash, set sports circles
to buzzing last week.
Now il appears that it was not the editor, but the sports
editor of the Emerald; that the sports editor had not made
the charges himself, but was merely passing on an article
that he had picked up from the Idaho Aryomuit of the
I 'diversity of Idaho; that the An/auanl was not doing the
squawking, but simply quoting an article written by L. H.
(iregory of the Morning Orcr/onian: and that Mr. Gregory's
devastating barrage appeared in the Portland paper sev
eral years ago!
The low down on the situation was revealed yesterday
in a letter received from Editor Dick Neuberger of the
()return Daily Emerald, explaining that his sports editor
may not have made it clear enough that he was merely
quoting, and not attacking. The letter contains an apology
in behalf of the Emerald.
That's all right, Editor Neuberger; your sports writer
can hardly be blamed if he failed to explain the true
origin of the charges.
Even had there been room for such an explanation in
bis column, bis readers would give little credence to a yarn
that someone heard that someone told someone else that
he bad seen it in some paper that was quoting some other
rag, etc., ad infinitum.
