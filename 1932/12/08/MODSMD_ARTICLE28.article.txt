This Sunday the All-Anierican Hoard of Football will
issue ils team tor 11>32. Incorporated and ])added with
dignity, this group of eoaehes gives the final word 011 who
shall he labeled for the Hall of Fame. These gentlemen
have become convinced, apparently, that to them is given
the divine inspiration for choosing from among thousands
of players the eleven greatest. The immensity Of the task
has not shaken their confidence or disturbed their sense
of humor.
The coach in any college has a difficult time selecting
the best eleven men from his squad of only fifty players.
An all-conference team is never satisfactory to more than
half Ihe experts concerned. An all-regional team, such as
all-coast or all-wet—, is satisfactory to only a few. Every
one is conscious of this hut still the Hoard announces an
All-American team. Ibis honorable group does not pass
the selection off as just their opinion of the matter, like
(irantland Rice or some other individual, hilt instead they
feel so sure of the "divine" element that they present an
engraved diploma to the surprised victim.
Any football player knows that the varying conditions
that exist in the different parts of the country make com
parison of players impossible. Furthermore the Hoard
makes the situation more ridiculous by portioning out the
positions according to sections of Ihe country. In 1030
most people felt that the Notre Dame team should have
been put on as a unit. The 1.5.C.. baekfield of last year
might well have been considered as a group, ('boosing a
team as one, or possibly a line and baekfield separately,
is the only possible way an Ail-American eleven could be
chosen fairly; even then there would he plenty of argu
ments.
The ri'ductio ad absurdiim of all-thi.s and all-thai was
made by a Junior College coach whose chosen eleven con
tained a man who was not registered at any school of the
conference. Hut of course this coach was not possessed of
the divine vision .
