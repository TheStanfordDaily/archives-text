# A 						JOB WELL DONE

Tliiil jolly-up for Upper Division transfers al Rohlc
last night was a good idea, and il turned out to he a good
jolly-up. A recently conceived addition to the multiple
;ind overlapping family of committees on the campus, the
Stanford Student Committee, which sponsored the affair,
proved again that it has a well-detined purpose and place
in that family.
The Stanford Student Committee is the somewhat latent
answer to Stanford's problem of making the junior college
man feel at home on the campus, of introducing him to
student social life. Duri/hg the current quarter il has
doubly distinguished itself at the smoker hist month, and
al last night's jolly-up.
The committee deserves a public back-slapping, because
il has discovered a need and remedied it, and because it
has managed to put on the aforementioned smoker and
jolly-up with a ridiculously low financial budget.
(treat credit should be given the women in the wel
coming committee, and Miss Doyle, for their hearty co
operation which gave the new student a send off in the
"social whirl" of the campus.
