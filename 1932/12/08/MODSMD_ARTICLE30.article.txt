# BULL SESSION
## TO BALANCE THE UNBALANCED 
### 
There are a certain number of
people in every community who are
always crying for "better govern
ment." They are usually very well
meaning citizens. Many of them are
scrupulously honest for the same
reason that the people in one of
Mark Twain's stories were—lack of
opportunity to be dishonest. They
always * buttonhole one on the
slightest provocation and jam one
full of musty governmental facts.
Finally, in weariness, your head
begins to nod. They jump at the
nod as approval and bustle ofi" to
meet the next "upright citizen."
These people are always looking i
for "improvements" in the govern
mental structure. Ne>v systems and i
administrative gadgets strike their |
fancy. Such a gadget was the "na- !
tional budget" several years ago. i
Yes, the nation lived for years with
out one of these things. But it was
finally installed at Washington, D.C.,
and reformers settled back to watch
business methodology in operation.
Now, the budget was a fine thing.
Most of these improvements are fine
things. No arguments can be found i
against them. But they are not auto- j
matic; and in operation, they rarely ;
succeed. The national budget is a
fine example. The budget tells ap- j
proximately how much we will be I
in the "red"—which is some satis- |
faction. But it takes a political con- j
gress to GET us out of the cardinal 1
and into the green pastures. It takes j
political action to paint blue skies i
in the national fiscal set-up.
And what botchers! They will !
wield the brush of state with a J
wavering, uncontrolled hand. And i

can we blame the congressmen—
well-meaning citizens content to live
on the government's payroll (most
of them)? Everybody wants the
budget cut down; but no one can
suggest anything to cut. Everyone
wants to raise taxes; but the taxes
must be painless, and completely
inconspicuous.
Congress is supposed to represent
the firm wave of public opinion.
But if that wave is a violent eddy
of cross-currents —a veritable male
strom of differences and contradic
tions, what can we expect the con
gressmen to do? The poor fellows
are getting bow-legged and splinter
seated from straddling so many
fences. They put their head out to
see which way the wind is blowing
and get their necks tied into a
double sheep-shank. (Now, you Boy
Scouts!)
The secretaries of the various
federal departments made their re
ports. Each, almost, is sure that fed
eral expenditures must be cut. And
each is sure that his department
must be saved at all costs. The na
tional life is periled if their particu
lar department is cut—of that, they
are positive.
We need money for public works
—but the budget must be cut. Sur
plus federal employees must be fired
—but unemployment cannot be in
creased. We must tax beer and wine
—but it must be cheap enough to
undersell bootleggers and be avail
able for the common man. Income
taxes must be raised—but initiative
cannot be discouraged.
Congress will have to TAKE it—
plenty. —Abe MellinkoiY
