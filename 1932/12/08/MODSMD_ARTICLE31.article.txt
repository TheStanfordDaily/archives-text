"BRIEF MOMENT" (Bchrman)—At |
the Curran Theatre.
A delightful, sparkling play given I
a well-rounded production .with a !
brilliant cast, smooth direction, a
striking set, and a rapid tempo—
result: an evening of delightful en
tertainment too rarely achieved by
a modern theatre now content with
hollow pseudo-sophistication. This
happy result has been attained to a
gratifying degree by "Brief Mo- i
ment," from the pen of N. S. Behr- j
man.
Author Behrmafi not only achieves
the sparkle and sophistication of
which Philip Barry and Noel Cow
ard are masters, but he has created
a set of characters who ring true.
They are men and women whom he
understands and whom the audience
understands; the play is a paragon
of finely drawn characters.
An introspective young million
aire marries Abby Fane, chorus girl,
who not only acquires all the refine
ment of the position, but becomes a
coquette and a celebrity-hunting
hostess as well. These two obstacles
and particularly the reappearance
of his wife's former swain, cause the
husband to break up the match. The
third act is not so skillfully written
! as the first two, lacking their clar
j ity, but it brings the play to an
I effective if not surprising conclu-
I sion.
I The central figure of the play, the
| wife, is excellently played by Shar-
I on Lynne, who gives it just enough
i vivacity, humor, sympathy, and ir
| responsibility. Harrison Ford's part
' of the husband is insipidly written,
: but he manages to make it mainly
[ convincing.
The best part of the play, Sig,
j friend of the husband, is played per
i fectly by Ralph Freud, who is al
! ternately caustic, sympathetic, lazy,
! grouchy, and insane—and at all
| times delightful. The rest of the cast
is splendid, histrionically and pic
; torially. —Chapin
! DON JUAN — At the Marionette
Guild, 718 Montgomery, San Fran
cisco.
In the picturesque setting of the
I old Barbary Coast, Ralph Chesse
! presented his marionettes in Mo
: here's slightly macaber "Don Juan."
; The play is amusing, chiefly because
! of its intense moral tone, due mainly
| to the character of Sganarelie, a
! weak-hearted and minded servant,
i In the reading of this part,
' Chesse stood out <;bove all the
others. Crawford Perks and Charles
| Bratt in the men's roles, and Mar
j celle Chesse in the women's, read
well, but not exceptionally. The play
i was marred only by the amateur
ishness of Bob Southwick, playing
M. Dimanche and a beggar.
The settings and lighting were
i adequately done, and the marion
j ettcs themselves created an astound
ingly realistic illusion. The manipu
lation was good, but certainly not
up to the quality of the reading.
The only jarring note of the whole
evening's entertainment was the
music—poor records played on a
poorer phonograph. However, if we
of the alleged art-loving group
would give Mr. Chesses theatre the
patronage which it deserves, it might
perhaps, be justified in purchasing a
more adequate accompaniment. The
evening is well worth the trip to
the city and the fifty cents for ad
mission. The general tone of the en
tertainment is certainly far above
that of the present talking-picture.

TED COAKLEY'S ORCHESTRA—
At the Athens Cluh, Oakland.
If you like a personality band,
you'll like Ted Coakley's orchestra,
j II is composed of a number of young

blades recently graduated from or at
least exposed to nearby colleges,
among them Stanford, St. Mary's,
and California—and their youthful
exuberance fairly glimmers through
the orchestrations.
They have had a considerable
amount of experience, outstanding
items of which are an around-the
world tour on the Dollar Line boats
and a tour of the Northwest with
Captain Dobsey and his crew last
summer.
The orchestrations, although ex
clusively arranged within the or
chestra give an effect similar to
those of Anson Weeks but the most
outstanding feature is the singers.
Virginia Haig is about as big as a
minute but her appeal is not nearly
so limited. Her eyes make the most
prossaic songs, UNprosaic. What
Virginia does with her eyes, Carl
Rovazza does with his smile. And
you must hear A1 Morris sing "That's
Why Darkies Were Born"! Then you
will have heard Ted Coakley's band.

TED COAKLEY'S ORCHESTRA—
At the Athens Cluh, Oakland.
If you like a personality band,
you'll like Ted Coakley's orchestra,
j II is composed of a number of young

blades recently graduated from or at
least exposed to nearby colleges,
among them Stanford, St. Mary's,
and California—and their youthful
exuberance fairly glimmers through
the orchestrations.
They have had a considerable
amount of experience, outstanding
items of which are an around-the
world tour on the Dollar Line boats
and a tour of the Northwest with
Captain Dobsey and his crew last
summer.
The orchestrations, although ex
clusively arranged within the or
chestra give an effect similar to
those of Anson Weeks but the most
outstanding feature is the singers.
Virginia Haig is about as big as a
minute but her appeal is not nearly
so limited. Her eyes make the most
prossaic songs, UNprosaic. What
Virginia does with her eyes, Carl
Rovazza does with his smile. And
you must hear A1 Morris sing "That's
Why Darkies Were Born"! Then you
will have heard Ted Coakley's band.

"BRIEF MOMENT" (Bchrman)—At |
the Curran Theatre.
A delightful, sparkling play given I
a well-rounded production .with a !
brilliant cast, smooth direction, a
striking set, and a rapid tempo—
result: an evening of delightful en
tertainment too rarely achieved by
a modern theatre now content with
hollow pseudo-sophistication. This
happy result has been attained to a
gratifying degree by "Brief Mo- i
ment," from the pen of N. S. Behr- j
man.
Author Behrmafi not only achieves
the sparkle and sophistication of
which Philip Barry and Noel Cow
ard are masters, but he has created
a set of characters who ring true.
They are men and women whom he
understands and whom the audience
understands; the play is a paragon
of finely drawn characters.
An introspective young million
aire marries Abby Fane, chorus girl,
who not only acquires all the refine
ment of the position, but becomes a
coquette and a celebrity-hunting
hostess as well. These two obstacles
and particularly the reappearance
of his wife's former swain, cause the
husband to break up the match. The
third act is not so skillfully written
! as the first two, lacking their clar
j ity, but it brings the play to an
I effective if not surprising conclu-
I sion.
I The central figure of the play, the
| wife, is excellently played by Shar-
I on Lynne, who gives it just enough
i vivacity, humor, sympathy, and ir
| responsibility. Harrison Ford's part
' of the husband is insipidly written,
: but he manages to make it mainly
[ convincing.
The best part of the play, Sig,
j friend of the husband, is played per
i fectly by Ralph Freud, who is al
! ternately caustic, sympathetic, lazy,
! grouchy, and insane—and at all
| times delightful. The rest of the cast
is splendid, histrionically and pic
; torially. —Chapin
! DON JUAN — At the Marionette
Guild, 718 Montgomery, San Fran
cisco.
In the picturesque setting of the
I old Barbary Coast, Ralph Chesse
! presented his marionettes in Mo
: here's slightly macaber "Don Juan."
; The play is amusing, chiefly because
! of its intense moral tone, due mainly
| to the character of Sganarelie, a
! weak-hearted and minded servant,
i In the reading of this part,
' Chesse stood out <;bove all the
others. Crawford Perks and Charles
| Bratt in the men's roles, and Mar
j celle Chesse in the women's, read
well, but not exceptionally. The play
i was marred only by the amateur
ishness of Bob Southwick, playing
M. Dimanche and a beggar.
The settings and lighting were
i adequately done, and the marion
j ettcs themselves created an astound
ingly realistic illusion. The manipu
lation was good, but certainly not
up to the quality of the reading.
The only jarring note of the whole
evening's entertainment was the
music—poor records played on a
poorer phonograph. However, if we
of the alleged art-loving group
would give Mr. Chesses theatre the
patronage which it deserves, it might
perhaps, be justified in purchasing a
more adequate accompaniment. The
evening is well worth the trip to
the city and the fifty cents for ad
mission. The general tone of the en

i In the reading of this part,
' Chesse stood out <;bove all the
others. Crawford Perks and Charles

j celle Chesse in the women's, read
well, but not exceptionally. The play
i was marred only by the amateur
ishness of Bob Southwick, playing
M. Dimanche and a beggar.
The settings and lighting were
i adequately done, and the marion
j ettcs themselves created an astound
ingly realistic illusion. The manipu
lation was good, but certainly not
up to the quality of the reading.
The only jarring note of the whole
evening's entertainment was the
music—poor records played on a
poorer phonograph. However, if we
of the alleged art-loving group
would give Mr. Chesses theatre the
patronage which it deserves, it might
perhaps, be justified in purchasing a
more adequate accompaniment. The
evening is well worth the trip to
the city and the fifty cents for ad
mission. The general tone of the en
tertainment is certainly far above
that of the present talking-picture.

TED COAKLEY'S ORCHESTRA—
At the Athens Cluh, Oakland.
If you like a personality band,
you'll like Ted Coakley's orchestra,
j II is composed of a number of young

blades recently graduated from or at
least exposed to nearby colleges,
among them Stanford, St. Mary's,
and California—and their youthful
exuberance fairly glimmers through
the orchestrations.
They have had a considerable
amount of experience, outstanding
items of which are an around-the
world tour on the Dollar Line boats
and a tour of the Northwest with
Captain Dobsey and his crew last
summer.
The orchestrations, although ex
clusively arranged within the or
chestra give an effect similar to
those of Anson Weeks but the most
outstanding feature is the singers.
Virginia Haig is about as big as a
minute but her appeal is not nearly
so limited. Her eyes make the most
prossaic songs, UNprosaic. What
Virginia does with her eyes, Carl
Rovazza does with his smile. And
you must hear A1 Morris sing "That's
Why Darkies Were Born"! Then you
will have heard Ted Coakley's band.

"BRIEF MOMENT" (Bchrman)—At |
the Curran Theatre.
A delightful, sparkling play given I
a well-rounded production .with a !
brilliant cast, smooth direction, a
striking set, and a rapid tempo—
result: an evening of delightful en
tertainment too rarely achieved by
a modern theatre now content with
hollow pseudo-sophistication. This
happy result has been attained to a
gratifying degree by "Brief Mo- i
ment," from the pen of N. S. Behr- j
man.
Author Behrmafi not only achieves
the sparkle and sophistication of
which Philip Barry and Noel Cow
ard are masters, but he has created
a set of characters who ring true.
They are men and women whom he
understands and whom the audience
understands; the play is a paragon
of finely drawn characters.
An introspective young million
aire marries Abby Fane, chorus girl,
who not only acquires all the refine
ment of the position, but becomes a
coquette and a celebrity-hunting
hostess as well. These two obstacles
and particularly the reappearance
of his wife's former swain, cause the
husband to break up the match. The
third act is not so skillfully written
! as the first two, lacking their clar
j ity, but it brings the play to an
I effective if not surprising conclu-
I sion.
I The central figure of the play, the
| wife, is excellently played by Shar-
I on Lynne, who gives it just enough
i vivacity, humor, sympathy, and ir
| responsibility. Harrison Ford's part
' of the husband is insipidly written,
: but he manages to make it mainly
[ convincing.
The best part of the play, Sig,
j friend of the husband, is played per
i fectly by Ralph Freud, who is al
! ternately caustic, sympathetic, lazy,
! grouchy, and insane—and at all
| times delightful. The rest of the cast
is splendid, histrionically and pic
; torially. —Chapin
