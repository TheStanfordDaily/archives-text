FACTS ON THE AXE
The Editor, Sir:
"Tis written that when one can
find no grounds of defense he re
ports to ridicule.
The admirable complaint in "Old
Ironsides" to preserve the axe in
all its pristine glory was met by an
editorial answer yesterday that
floundered dismally and ended with
ridicule that was very weak indeed.
If the axe is to be abolished till
it looks as it looked in the '90's on
the day it was forged, it would
hardly be the Stanford axe. The
weapon didn't become a tradition
until it had spent a few years aban
doned in a thicket near Felt Lake,
a couple of months in a scrap pile
in the corporation yard, and ac
quired a coat of red paint from a
self-appointed Rally Committee on
the eve of the second Stanford-
California baseball game of the 1899
series. On the night of that rally,
Thursday, April 13, 1899, the "Stan
ford Axe," as such, was born. It
was not created on the day it was
forged.
And all the nicks and scars ac
j quired since, including the scores of
i the two games of that 1899 series
I marked on the blade by its Cali-
I fornian captors, are indissoluble
knit into its history. To paint out
I those scars and to shine its edge is
I nothing short of desecration.
