## HORATIUS VS. BRIDGE 
### BY OLD DR. ALGAR 
"A number of medical and educa
tional authorities have declared that
, contract bridge is a 'mania' threat
ening to affect the miinds of the
30,000,000 who play it."—News Item.
That latly climbing trees with
squirrels
Once lived 'midst "teas and social
whirls
Quite sane and upright were her
acts
Until she started playing eon
tract.
I I I
And see that man in yonder cage
Compiling length of worms by
age?
His classes learned historical
fact,
Until he started playing con
tract.
That fellow with Napoleon's hat
Who's grinning like a Cheshire
cat
Could draw the aces back to
back
Until he started playing con
tract.
Why am I here? Well, friend,
you see
I'm crazy as these other three
At them I once could laugh and
hiss
Until I took up contract bridge
and started writing stuff
like this.
"DIVORCE 2 weeks, no delay, no
! publicity, no res. req., easy terms.
P.O. Box 1730, S.F."—S.F. Call-Bul
letin.
Sounds as if you don't even have
to be married!
