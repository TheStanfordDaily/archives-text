Yes—an eight-hour egg.
"Yes, I will place my right toe,
and maybe my heel, or possibly my
whole right foot on the shore of
America, so that forty-seven mil
-1 lions and all the other millions in
I that country can rush there and
worship the footprint I shall leave
in the sand. But I will not go on
shore anywhere in the United
States."—George Bernard Shaw.
