FOR THE MOST PART we lay
off our editor and his editorial col
umn, and we get the same courtesy
from him, but when he gets on the
subject of the axe, we register in
terest.
That old axe was a baseball
trophy (yes, Horace, a BASE
BALL trophy) and although we
do not advoate trying to keep
it a baseball trophy in these
days of super football interest
we do feel that it should be
made a representative prize.
There are three possible ways that
the winner could be judged. It could
be purely a football prize, which is
without rhyme or reason, except
that most people think it is a good
idea. It could be made the posses
sion of the winner of a majority of
the major sports between California
and Stanford. There are only five,
so it would always come out all
right. This is most feasible because
it is the way to make it a repre
sentative symbol. Or it could re
main a baseball trophy. This is the
fairest way, but undoubtedly the
least popular jf the three methods.
In case you didn't know it.
California brought the axe out
before the annual horsehidc
series with the Indians right up
to 1 930, and a member of the
varsity ball club was the keeper
of the axe.
But whatever they do, this much
we would like to see happen. Put
the darn thing on a plaque, and with
it somehow get its history. We feel
that, above all, its history belongs
with it. And last but not least, LAY
OFF polishing the blade and putting
a gilded handle on it.
If you don't want the axe as
it is, with its dents, scratched
soeres, etc., throw the iron
away, and let's forget about it.
•+ ♦
NOW THAT WE'VE disagreed
with the big mogul in the front of
fice, we'll turn about and pat him
on the back.
When he advised people who
really have something to do with
picking Pop's successor to wait, and
then go on waiting until they can
be sure that they are not putting
their foot into the soup, he emitted
one of the sagest ideas we have had
Ihe pleasure of reading for some
time.
About the worst thing Stan
ford could do would be acquire
a blustering, "psychological"
coach who would boom the
University to the skies, and then
come out with a team that
played spotty football, and that
didn't think he was worth
recognizing on the street.
The idea of a coach setting an
example is not all hooey.

made a representative prize.
There are three possible ways that
the winner could be judged. It could
be purely a football prize, which is
without rhyme or reason, except
that most people think it is a good
idea. It could be made the posses
sion of the winner of a majority of
the major sports between California
and Stanford. There are only five,
so it would always come out all
right. This is most feasible because
it is the way to make it a repre
sentative symbol. Or it could re
main a baseball trophy. This is the
fairest way, but undoubtedly the
least popular jf the three methods.
In case you didn't know it.
California brought the axe out
before the annual horsehidc
series with the Indians right up
to 1 930, and a member of the
varsity ball club was the keeper
of the axe.
But whatever they do, this much
we would like to see happen. Put
the darn thing on a plaque, and with
it somehow get its history. We feel
that, above all, its history belongs
with it. And last but not least, LAY
OFF polishing the blade and putting
a gilded handle on it.
If you don't want the axe as
it is, with its dents, scratched
soeres, etc., throw the iron
away, and let's forget about it.

NOW THAT WE'VE disagreed
with the big mogul in the front of
fice, we'll turn about and pat him
on the back.
When he advised people who
really have something to do with
picking Pop's successor to wait, and
then go on waiting until they can
be sure that they are not putting
their foot into the soup, he emitted
one of the sagest ideas we have had
Ihe pleasure of reading for some
time.
About the worst thing Stan
ford could do would be acquire
a blustering, "psychological"
coach who would boom the
University to the skies, and then
come out with a team that
played spotty football, and that
didn't think he was worth
recognizing on the street.
The idea of a coach setting an
example is not all hooey.

FOR THE MOST PART we lay
off our editor and his editorial col
umn, and we get the same courtesy
from him, but when he gets on the
subject of the axe, we register in
terest.
That old axe was a baseball
trophy (yes, Horace, a BASE
BALL trophy) and although we
do not advoate trying to keep
it a baseball trophy in these
days of super football interest
we do feel that it should be
made a representative prize.
