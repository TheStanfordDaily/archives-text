# Loss Of Two Stars Hurts Card Hoop Chances
## BUNN REINFORCES GAGE OFFENSE BY TWO LINE SHIFTS Bob O'Connor, Tex Walker Go To Offense Post From Guard Job 
### 
Strengthening the offense of the
Indian cage squad is the biggest
problem confronting Coach John
Bunn at present as a result of
which he made two line-up shifts
this week.
Bob O'Conner and "Tex'' Walker,
ex-football stars, are the two men
who figured in the change. Both
have been working at guard, but
due to the preponderance of ma
terial at that position and the lack
of offensive strength to date, Bunn
felt that the shift might make the
Cards a more potent aggregation.,
Forwards Small
O'Conner is one of the largest
men on the squad and his size may
make it possible to work him in as
a running mate for Tom Cordry.
The majority of forward candidates
are small, which would be a decided
disadvantage in games with U.S.C.,
California, and U.C.L.A., who are
reported to have large teams.
In order to lose more effectively
his ranginess, activeness, and speed.
Walker has been moved to center
where he should make competition
hot for Dave Packard and Hal Ede
len in spite of his inexperience.
Ineligibility Hurts
Ineligibility dealt the squad a
second blow when it was learned
that Jack Cosgrove, letterman at
guard, will be unable to compete,
due to the fact that he played in
one tennis match last season, which
athletically constitutes a quarter of
residence, before he took a leave of
absence. Keith Topping, a great po
tential star, has already been de
clared ineligible but may be able to
clear up his scholastic difficulties
before next quarter.
A number of football men have
reported for the squad, the latest
addition being Tommy Lambert,
j letterman at forward, and Coach
! Bunn is gradually working them in
I before selecting the 10 men who
i will make the Midwestern trip dur
' ing Christmas vacation.
