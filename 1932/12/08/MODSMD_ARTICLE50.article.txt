## 
### 
Although there have been innu
merable ail-American teams select-
Jed throughout the country to date,
j only two men have won the highest
! of football honor by being unani
| mous choices. These two men are
Harry Newman, Michigan's succes
i sor to the great Friedman, and Paul
i Moss, whose name will live in Big
| Ten history alongside those of Oos
terbaan and Fesler, the other im
i mortal ends from that conference.
;Both of these men played faultless
'football on faultless teams—neither
j Michigan nor Purdue having lost a
j game all season—and both were the

, chief reasons why their respective
elevens enjoyed such .success.
» Both of these two greats will show
coast football followers just why
. they were voted to be so outstand
ing when they play in the annual
t Shrine game at Kezar Stadium on
January 2. They were chosen by
. Coaches Andy Kerr and Dick Han
. ley to be members of the powerful
[ Eastern team which will prepare to
, ! battle at this time with a similarly
' picked squad of Western gridder.s.
. ' A record of the colors of 3,900
; bricks, collected from all parts of
• the country, has been made by the
