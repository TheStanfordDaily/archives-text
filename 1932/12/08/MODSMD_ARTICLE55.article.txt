# FRANCES RUSSELL PUBLISHES BOOK ANALYZING VARIOUS UTOPIAN IDEAS
## 
### 
Mankind's numerous gropings for
the ideal world as expressed
through the ages have all been
condensed, analyzed, and interpreted
by Mrs. ' Frances Theresa Russell,
associate professor of English, in her
new book released last week by the
Dial Press, "Touring Utopia."
; More than twelve years' elforthas
1 gone into the volume. Mrs. Russell
has searched the stacks of every
known Utopian plan in every lan
guage, reading originals when she
could not obtain translations. She
mentions but one consoling circum
stance. "I never had to translate any
languages of the Orient, since there
are no Oriental Utopias."
Her own definition of Utopia, Mrs.
Russell gives as "a crystallized ex
pression in dramatic form of the
j author's ideals and includes all of
the major issues of human exist
ence."
Each of these issues, which she
lists as government, education, la
bor, leisure, art, religion, and do
mesticity, she has traced in its de
velopment and treatment in the dif
ferent Utopias of history.
In her study of these ideal states,
says the author, she has found a
great diversity of details but a uni
formity of ideals. Contrary to popu
lar belief, all Utopias are not social
istic or communistic; many are au
tocratic and dictatorial.
Summarizing the modern trend
toward Utopia, Mrs. Russell has em
bodied some of her own conclusions.
She sees in the future a more ideal
ized population carrying on a co
operative, constructive government,
having universal state education,

I regulating labor, retaining in its es-
I sentials the home, placing less em
| phasis on theology and more on
ethics.
"The old Utopias were something
their creators hoped rather than ex
pected to see. Our new Utopias are
dynamic and growing and leave
j room for infinite progress. To be
, practical is the only hope of civiliza
tion," she adds.
"It is only in proportion as we be
come Utopian-minded that there
will be any hope of progress," she
j concludes. "It is the Utopian-minded
people who are the advance road
makers. They make a definite ad
venture with a goal in sight."
By an old Virginia blue law a man
may be fined 50 pounds of tobacco
for non-attendance at church.
