### 
'"Germany in Transition" is the
topic of a lecture by Newton H.
Bell, noted lecturer and writer on
international relations and foreign
travel, which will be given at 8
o'clock tomorrow evening at the
Cardinal Hotel. It is the fourth of a
series of lectures sponsored by the
American Association of University
Women.
Mr. Bell will base his discussion
on personal experiences, having
toured western Europe and Soviet
Russia last summer. He arrived in
Berlin on the day martial law was
declared on account of the overturn
of the Prussian government by the
central government.
As well as being elected a fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society
of Great Britain in 1927, Bell was
recently decorated by the French
Government and made an officer of
the French Academy for "conspicu
ous service rendered in the dis
semination of French culture."
He served in the American Expe
ditionary Forces in France during
part of the World War, and later
acted as an interpreter.
Since the war the lecturer has
been abroad eight times. In 1922 he
crossed the Sahara desert by camel
and motor and in 1925 toured Eu
rope by airplane.

South Carolina is the only state
that does not grant divorces.
