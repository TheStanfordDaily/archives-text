# Boggs Flays English Plan To Pay U.S. Debt In Gold
## 
### David Mellinkoff 
As the Ides of December once
more roll around, the United States
government is again confronted with
a hungry pack of sad-faced debtors
screaming for cancellation or delay
of impending obligations. A year
ago, to the question of "WILL YOU
WAIT?" President Herbert Clark
Hoover answered blithely, "YES."
7'oday an impatient Congress an
swers emphatically "NO."
But what will happen if England
and the other nations of Europe do
meet the December 15 payments in
bar gold? Last nigh' Professor of
Economics Theodore H. Boggs sum
marized the tide of opinion in re
gard to this very vital problem.
Dr. Boggs pointed to Sir Robert
Home, former Chancellor of the
British Exchequer, who advocates
that England pay in gold as long as
she can, get rid of all gold, and then
stabilize the pound sterling on a
paper basis.
If this plan were to be carried
out by the European debtors, with
the exception of France, the United
States would ultimately be left sit
ting upon a pile of glittering gold
that would be comparatively useless
in a world where sterling was the
medium of exehance. said the nro-

' fessor.
Another British statesman, the
Honorable L. M. Ame»y, a former
I cabinet minister, also supports pay
ment in gold. This, according to
Amery, should be followed up by
high customs duties on American
products.—to he paid only in gold.
The obvious result of such a pol
iey, says Professor Boggs, would be
endless disputes over tariff and cus
toms collections, and unending in
ternational discord.
He indicated the futility of at
tempting to collect all of the debts
in bar gold. Said Dr. Boggs: "The
world supply of monetary gold is
eleven billion dollars. France and
the United States at present are in
i possession of seventy-live per cent of
this total. Complete debt payments,
including both interest and prin
cipal, would mount up to over 22
millions of dollars."
"Gold can be used this December,
but Barron's Financial Weekly of
New Yoik states that the debts were
loaned out in commodities and ser
vices and can only be repaid in like
fashion.
"Any attempt to force all pay
ments in cold must inevitably result

government is again confronted with
a hungry pack of sad-faced debtors
screaming for cancellation or delay
of impending obligations. A year
ago, to the question of "WILL YOU
WAIT?" President Herbert Clark
Hoover answered blithely, "YES."
7'oday an impatient Congress an
swers emphatically "NO."
But what will happen if England
and the other nations of Europe do
meet the December 15 payments in
bar gold? Last nigh' Professor of
Economics Theodore H. Boggs sum
marized the tide of opinion in re
gard to this very vital problem.
Dr. Boggs pointed to Sir Robert
Home, former Chancellor of the
British Exchequer, who advocates
that England pay in gold as long as
she can, get rid of all gold, and then
stabilize the pound sterling on a
paper basis.
If this plan were to be carried
out by the European debtors, with
the exception of France, the United
States would ultimately be left sit
ting upon a pile of glittering gold
that would be comparatively useless
in a world where sterling was the
medium of exehance. said the nro-

' fessor.
Another British statesman, the
Honorable L. M. Ame»y, a former
I cabinet minister, also supports pay
ment in gold. This, according to
Amery, should be followed up by
high customs duties on American
products.—to he paid only in gold.
The obvious result of such a pol
iey, says Professor Boggs, would be
endless disputes over tariff and cus
toms collections, and unending in
ternational discord.
He indicated the futility of at
tempting to collect all of the debts
in bar gold. Said Dr. Boggs: "The
world supply of monetary gold is
eleven billion dollars. France and
the United States at present are in
i possession of seventy-live per cent of
this total. Complete debt payments,
including both interest and prin
cipal, would mount up to over 22
millions of dollars."
"Gold can be used this December,
but Barron's Financial Weekly of
New Yoik states that the debts were
loaned out in commodities and ser
vices and can only be repaid in like
fashion.

ments in cold must inevitably result
