# LAY PLANS FOR THEATRE DRIVE
## 
### 
For the first time in five- years an
organized movement to build an
adequate theatre on the Stanford
Campus is under way. Backed by
the Dramatics Council, campus pub
lications, student body officials, and
general campus sentiment, plans are
rapidly being formed.
Bill Corbus announced last night
a committee of nine would be named
to carry on definite plans. This com
mittee, which will function under
A.S.S.U. constitutional provisions,
ir> the first of its kind established on
the campus since 1928 when Jack
Shoup, Chappie editor in 1928-29,
led a similar movement.
Tentative plans call for committee
members to interview prominent
and influential Stanford alumni
during the Christmas holidays for
pledging of necessary financial sup
port.
The Theatre Fund Committee,
through past activities sponsored by
the organization, now possesses ap
proximately five thousand dollars
which at present is a part of the
Students' Organization Fund.
The Stanford Board of Trustees,
at the close of the late war, was
named as trustee for a fund do
nated by friends and relatives of
students killed in the war, for the
purpose of raising a suitable war
memorial in their memory., This
fund amounts to $132,000. It is hoped
I hat the Stanford Board of Trustees
will turn the money over to the
Theatre Fund Committee for use in
building the proposed theatre.
