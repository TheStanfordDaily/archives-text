# Campbell Urges Observance Of Code For Finals
## Men's Council Chairman Explains System 
### 
With final examinations but a !
week away, Gordon Campbell, |
chairman of Men's Council, last night}
issued the following statement on j
the Honor Code.
Its intent is to remind old stu- j
dents that continued successful op- |
eration of the Code is dependent j
upon their observance of it, and to j
explain and clarify for new students !
the system under which examina- j
tions are conducted at Stanford, j
Campbell said.
Expulsion Penalty
"A violation of the Honor Code is I
penalized by expulsion from Stan- j
ford University for a period of three !
quarters, or permanently, depending j
on the fiagrance of the offense.
'"Any unpermitted aid given or!
received and handed in to be used j
as a basis for grading constitutes a
violation of the Honor Code. Term ;
reports and English compositions
must be the original work of the
student. If books are used, full
credit must be given to the author.
Should a statement be taken bodily
from a book, such statement shall i
be enclosed in quotations and ac
credited to its author. It is needless
to say that any cheating in examina
tions is included among Honor Code
offenses and strictly punishable.
Few Violations
"Because of the high type of stu
dent found at Stanford, cases of
cheating are few and far between, j
However that may be, this is al- |
ways an undesirable element in any I
collegiate institution which insists j
on under-handed conduct, and it is i
the purpose of the Honor Code to ;
deal with such an element.
"Any students who fail to report j
Honor Code violators are injuring j
themselves, not only by allowing the j
class average to be raised, but also j
by giving their loyalty to a super- |
ficial student who cannot in any I
degree command their respect. In•
short, loyalty is given where no j
loyalty is due.
Gentleman's Code
"The Honor System is merely the j
code of a gentleman. It implies or j
takes for granted that students won't j
crib in exams, and that when left
alone will conduct themselves hon
orably. The alternative or Proctor
system implies that students are po
tential cheaters. Such implication is
evidenced by proctors' snooping up
and down the aisles, or peering over
shoulders as the case may be.
"Stanford University students!
have whole-heartedly voted time;
and again for the retention of the j
Honor Code—such an attitude is a J
true indication of the Honor Code's j
success."

deal with such an element.
"Any students who fail to report j
Honor Code violators are injuring j
themselves, not only by allowing the j
class average to be raised, but also j
by giving their loyalty to a super- |
ficial student who cannot in any I
degree command their respect. In•
short, loyalty is given where no j
loyalty is due.
Gentleman's Code
"The Honor System is merely the j
code of a gentleman. It implies or j
takes for granted that students won't j
crib in exams, and that when left
alone will conduct themselves hon
orably. The alternative or Proctor
system implies that students are po
tential cheaters. Such implication is
evidenced by proctors' snooping up
and down the aisles, or peering over
shoulders as the case may be.
"Stanford University students!
have whole-heartedly voted time;
and again for the retention of the j
Honor Code—such an attitude is a J
true indication of the Honor Code's j
success."
With final examinations but a !
week away, Gordon Campbell, |
chairman of Men's Council, last night}
issued the following statement on j
the Honor Code.
Its intent is to remind old stu- j
dents that continued successful op- |
eration of the Code is dependent j
upon their observance of it, and to j
explain and clarify for new students !
the system under which examina- j
tions are conducted at Stanford, j
Campbell said.
Expulsion Penalty
"A violation of the Honor Code is I
penalized by expulsion from Stan- j
ford University for a period of three !
quarters, or permanently, depending j
on the fiagrance of the offense.
'"Any unpermitted aid given or!
received and handed in to be used j
as a basis for grading constitutes a
violation of the Honor Code. Term ;
reports and English compositions
must be the original work of the
student. If books are used, full
credit must be given to the author.
Should a statement be taken bodily
from a book, such statement shall i
be enclosed in quotations and ac
credited to its author. It is needless
to say that any cheating in examina
tions is included among Honor Code
offenses and strictly punishable.
Few Violations
"Because of the high type of stu
dent found at Stanford, cases of
cheating are few and far between, j
However that may be, this is al- |
ways an undesirable element in any I
collegiate institution which insists j
on under-handed conduct, and it is i
the purpose of the Honor Code to ;
deal with such an element.
