No Application
No formal applications were be-
I fore the board last night, although
I ii. was assumed by Barrett that
| "certain people would be before us,
!if we want them." The names of
i the following men were brought up
i for discussion: Claude E. "Tiny"
j Thornhill, present line coach; Ernie
I Nevers, assistant here this year;
I Dick Hanley of Northwestern, An
j drew Kerr of Colgate, Maurice
j "Clipper" Smith of Santa Clara, and
! Dudley DeGroot of San Jose State.
Regarding the successor of War
| ner, Barrett said: "We are in favor
jof the continuance of the Warner
i system here at Stanford, and would
j put in an alumni member if pos
sible." However, he did not mean by
that that others were out of con
sideration, or that Thornhill, who is
not a Stanford alumnus, but one of
i the best Warner disciples in the
! game, would be eliminated.
