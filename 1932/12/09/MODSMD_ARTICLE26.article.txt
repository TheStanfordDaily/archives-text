# THE
						UNKNOWN STUDENT
## 
### 
Slipping off into oblivion is the horrid prospect that
faces those students who do not go around to the Watson
Studio today to have their pictures taken for the Qu<i(l.\
Many cries have gone up from time to time that the last j
chance was on hand, but now, with the quarter over, the!
facts must be faced. Today is the last chance!
Imagine tlie annoyance of vour biographers when they
are seeking records of your university career and fail to
find even a smiling likeness of our hero in his college year
book. Or lake this angle, supposing old Hill Zany, next to
whose picture your profile would repose in the senior
section, should become President? Can't you imagine the
pride of your family in showing off the Quad to their
friends in future years and remarking what good pals papa
and the President were as undergraduates! A privilege
like this ought not to be missed, and yet there are a num
ber of seniors who are toying with fame this very moment
by not paying a call at the photographer.
Knowing that the seriousness of these suggestions will
strike the tardv seniors with telling force, we ask only
that you remember you are Stanford gentlemen and stay
in an orderly line while waiting your turn.
