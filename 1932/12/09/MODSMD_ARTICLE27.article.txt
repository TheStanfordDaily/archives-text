# AN OLD DREAM REBORN
## 
### 
Last night the Theatre Fund Committee, after a con
stitutional hibernation of several years, sprang into flesh
and blood again. The newly organized committee has a
very ambitious program up its sleeve. Within the next
mouth the committee hopes to shoot the moon, and the
lMu.v wants to align itself right now as a rocket behind
the committee's projectile.
In short, the Theatre Fund Committee hopes to secure J
•^i,'{o,ooo which have been lying dormant for some time in j
a War Memorial Fund, to raise a similarly large sum j
through an alumni subscription, and to erect therefrom aj
new theatre alongside the Art Callcry on the Library'
Quadrangle.
It's a great idea. What more fitting use could be made I
of the War Memorial Fund than to turn il into a Theatre
Fund, where it will serve a purpose of paramount value to
Ihe I Diversity ? Now is a line time to launch the theatre I
project, when the attention of tlie alumni is focused on j
Stanford, and when such a structure may be erected with
less expense than il would require in more prosperous
limes.
