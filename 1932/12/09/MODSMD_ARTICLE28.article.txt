Next year will be a lean year for rapid-lire radio an-t
liouncers, it' things go the way they are pointing at the
Pacific Coast Conference meeting in Los Angeles this week
end. The play-by-play broadcast from the stadium rim, so
instrumental in booming the popularity of collegiate foot-1
ball, seems destined to be voted down at the Conferencel
confab.
While the average fan's dollars for stadium seats have
been growing fewer and fewer, the realism and color of
game broadcasts have been getting better and better. This
tall Ihe balance point of these two realities was reached.
Result the average fan saved his dollars on Saturday
afternoons and listened to his radio.
In times like today all unnecessary luxuries must go by j
the boards. Football is a necessity, from the college point
ot view, radio broadcasting of the games a luxury. The
broadcasts have been popular with even the Conference of-;
ficials. Rut now those gentlemen, with an eye to Ihe college
athletic programs which rest upon football for their foun
dations, must padlock "the little glass room 'way up here
on Ihe Fast rim of Ihe stadium, folks."
Banning radio broadcasters is just about the only sen
sible course tor Ihe Conference to follow in its effort to
boost game attendance back up to the point where it was
in the la I e I wen ties, the golden autumns of the great Ameri
can lootball harvest. Of course play-by-play telegraphic
accounts of gridiron classics will be practically impossible i
to legislate against. I lie Conference can scarcely keep a
broadcast like that ot Ihe Stanford-Pittsburgh game ott the
air, as long as some advertiser is willing to pay the radio I
station for it. Rut that type of broadcast falls quite a little
short of the stadium rim variety, and the Conference meet
ing down South will take a big step toward saving football
from a slill greater economic crisis by enacting its iinini-l
nent ban on the "What a game!" bovs.
