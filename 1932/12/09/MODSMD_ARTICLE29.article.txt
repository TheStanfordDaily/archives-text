# BULL SESSION
## ANOTHER QUARTER—TO OBLIVION 
### 
The end of the quarter has sev-
I era] distinctive and recurrent attri
: butes. It is an appropriate time to
j get your bank statement and gripe '
j over the lact that they have de- j
; ducted the customary fifty cents for i
I accounts below $50. It i.s a very ex
! cellent opportunity to wish all your
; friends the bromidic toast—"have a j
j nice vacation."
; But best of all, it is a great op
j portunity to look back over the
I quarter and drool over things that i
| have gone by—and look ahead and \
| drool with anticipation of the things !
' that are to come. Intellectual drool
; ing never gets one anywhere; but i.s
'most satisfying. Just like biting on
a favorite pipe, even though it be !
unlit.
———— j
It i.s splendid sport to deck l your;
j acquaintances in flimsy chiffon, and '
j then parade them before a spotlight |
j of criticism. The results are astound- j
i ing. Gods (and goddesses) come
| tumbling down—not like leaves but I
j more like soggy pancakes on a wet j
I kitchen table. Some don't tumble— j
j but how lonely they look among the j
j tumbled heroes and heroines. But ;
j of course that may be due to the j
J evil-looking sky today and the wind j
I which goes through one's jacket and j
irritates the spleen u.~> well as rais- i
ing the gooseflesh.
Yes, the end of the quarter is a ;
great time to moralize on all your j
mistakes; and forgetting the pleas- j
ure they brought, make solemn i
promises that they will not be re- ;
peated in the future. And swearing'

off this or that doesn't sadden you
in the least because you know full
well that you will repeat the same
! "mistakes" in the future.
j And drooling ahead, there are
j visions of Santa Claus. Good old
Santa. Then a lump of slushy senti
| mentality rises when we think of
I the children of 12,000,000 unem
j ployed. The legend that Santa comes
i to the good and leaves in proportion
! to the goodness found—is in for a
beating. And so are the tattered
j little kids who treasure that legend.
My holiday presents have already
begun to sweep in. Some kind soul
I in the Registrar's Office sent me a
j copy of "Report of the Students'
j Organizations Fund." This is the
engaging little booklet with all the
j facts and figures of where the money
' goes and why there isn't more of it.
j Students will be interested to
j know that the Bookstore lost almost
I two thousand dollars although the
j net sales amounted to over $140,000.
: The Union System also went into
; the red, its net operating loss being
, over $4,000. It was a cardinal year
' all around, even the B.A.C. showing
| a $20,000 deficit after their con
j .struction work was paid for, but a
j fancy profit without that work,
I The little booklet has much cud
! upon which to chew next quarter.
! Until then, it is most appropriate
j and in the best of bromidic taste, to
I wish all a Merry Christmas and a
: Happy New Year.
