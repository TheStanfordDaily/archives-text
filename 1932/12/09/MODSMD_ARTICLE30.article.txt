PAYMENT DEFERRED (Metro)— ,
At Blanco's Theatre, Mountain
View.
It is to be regretted that Charles ;
Laughton is so little known in this j
country that a film of this calibre j
cannot hope for financal success and '
is consequently relegated to double 1
bills and single-day runs.
Laughton, whose success in this ■
play on Broadway during the last [
season, prompted Paramount to en
gage him for "The Devil and the j
Deep," is an actor of great ability. !
He made of his first picture—a
worthless melodrama without him— j
a film of merit. Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer's reason for making this film,
almost certainly doomed to a rapid
oblivion as it is, may remain ob
scure; but Laughtor.'s performance 1
will not soon be forgotten.
One seldom encounters real trag
edy, sincerely played, and unsenti- j
mentalized; "Payment Deferred" is i
good tragedy. It will inevitably be !
compared with "The Way of All j
Flesh" because of the similarity of
the chief character. But this picture j
is far better than the Jannings film, I
believable, and not descending to |

pathos for its effect. Laughton's per
formance—he acts with an almost
immobile face in much the Jannings
manner—is profoundly sincere.
The picture, because it presents
characters actually rather than ex
aggerating sympathy or, on the
other hand, presenting any charac
ter as unrelentingly bad, is likely
to leave the spectator less moved
than a sentimental drama would;
the mental ability of the catstrophe
somewhat detaches the audience
from the characters.
It is an exceptionally fine film; its
sincerity is a new quality in the
cinema, its actuality as infrequently
encountered. Metro's departure from
routine deserves more attention
than, I fear, it will receive at the
hands of a public which applauds
shoddy melodrama and is moved by
untidy romance.
Production is in keeping with the
character of the drama, Adrian has
been dispensed with, and adequate
support given the star. —Sandoe
Memphis is the largest manu
facturer of cottonseed products in
the United States.

The picture, because it presents
characters actually rather than ex

the mental ability of the catstrophe

It is an exceptionally fine film; its
sincerity is a new quality in the
cinema, its actuality as infrequently

routine deserves more attention
than, I fear, it will receive at the

shoddy melodrama and is moved by
untidy romance.
Production is in keeping with the
character of the drama, Adrian has

PAYMENT DEFERRED (Metro)— ,
At Blanco's Theatre, Mountain
View.
It is to be regretted that Charles ;
Laughton is so little known in this j
country that a film of this calibre j
cannot hope for financal success and '
is consequently relegated to double 1
bills and single-day runs.
Laughton, whose success in this ■
play on Broadway during the last [
season, prompted Paramount to en
gage him for "The Devil and the j
Deep," is an actor of great ability. !
He made of his first picture—a
worthless melodrama without him— j
a film of merit. Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer's reason for making this film,
almost certainly doomed to a rapid
oblivion as it is, may remain ob
scure; but Laughtor.'s performance 1
will not soon be forgotten.
One seldom encounters real trag
edy, sincerely played, and unsenti- j
mentalized; "Payment Deferred" is i
good tragedy. It will inevitably be !
compared with "The Way of All j
Flesh" because of the similarity of
the chief character. But this picture j
is far better than the Jannings film, I
believable, and not descending to |

pathos for its effect. Laughton's per
formance—he acts with an almost
immobile face in much the Jannings
manner—is profoundly sincere.
