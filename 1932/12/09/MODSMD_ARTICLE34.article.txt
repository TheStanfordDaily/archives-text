The Editor, Sir:
Please think it over, you students
and grads who value tradition, fel
lowship, ideals, and all that goes to
make Stanford a dear memory to
her proud children.
No one would think of defacing l
the American flag by painting it
different colors or by cutting out j
the stars, so why should the AXE, j
the symbol of Stanford, be repainted,
touched up, and modernized? It is j
bad enough that it should be put up j
as a trophy, which in itself is against
all principles and practices usually
accompanying such a deep-rooted
tradition.
Other traditional symbols are not
tiaded, the Golden Bear, the Hus
kies "Big Stick," the Little Brown
Jug, the Navy goat, and the Army t
mule, they stay at home and are

proudly displayed by their envied I
guardians. But the Axe, our symbol, i
is doomed to be a poker chip bet on
the Big Game; a tragic end for a |
noble tradition.
For 31 years students clamored
and fought to "get back the Axe"
and now you've got it, to make a
joke of, to be again taunted by
Berkeley with "who's got the axe?"
So if you must have a trophy,
make a replica, plaint it red, green,
or yellow, but please, for the sake
of tradition, don't destroy the only |
real traditional symbol of Stanford j
that has endured the sharp knife of !
faculty censorship.
