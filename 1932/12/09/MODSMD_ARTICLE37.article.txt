# Droffie Gives Tilt To U.S.C.

"U.S.C. will score thirty-three
points!" With these cryptic words,
Maurico Rapf, former editor of the
Los Angeles High School Blue and
White, author of M-G-M's fine pic
ture, "Divorce in the Family," and
member of the Stanford varsity
soccer squad, concluded an inter
view with Professor Johnny Drof
nats, DAILY staff commenators par
excellence. The amount of points to
be scored by Notre Dame is a mat
ter of conjecture, Mr. Rapf affirmed.
While stroking a luffly black fir,
Elizabeth Chapin, DAILY staff re
viewer, said: "I would feel a deli
cacy in commenting."
Harry L. McMasters, bent in
triguingly over a headline he was
writing, said: "I'm just a man in the
street. I don't know much about it,
but I'll give it to Notre Dame."
Robert Mynard, another scribe and
perhaps the seediest looking scribe
on the DAILY, says: "Notre Dame
by a touchdown."
Sig Unander, Alpha Tau Omega:
"I don't know anything about foot
ball. I just go to games so I can
carouse with the boys afterward."
Mary Delia Callahan (I wonder);
"Notre Dame, I suppose. But I
really don't know . . . I've never
lived."
Deciding it was about time she
did, Professor Drofnats concluded
his series of interviews at this point.
Oh yes . . .

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador, Dec. 8
