# DAILY CHOOSES ALL-UNIVERSITY SQUAD OF INTRAMURNL STARS
## 
### 
With the completion of all games
except the University Championship
contest to be played Monday, the
DAILY presents its all-University
intramural football team for 1932.
The sports writers who aided in
selecting this year's all-star eleven
have attempted to break away from
the usual custom of awarding all
the first-team positions to members
of the best all-around teams. Play
ers are judged on their individual
football ability, and not on the rec
ord made by their teams.
Because of the flexibility of intra
mural lineups, no attempt has been
made to rate the men in the posi

lions they have played during the
season, but rather to choose the
eleven best players in the Univer
sity, regardless of their playing po
sition. Although only seven men
constitute an intramural football
team, eleven men (the regulation
tackle football number) have been
placed on each of the honor teams.
The DAILY has attempted to
eliminate partiality in selecting the
all-University team. The selections
presented herewith were made by
members of the DAILY sports staff
who do not belong to any organiza
tions represented by intramural
football teams.
