# CARD LINKS SQUAD SHOWS TOP FORM AS SEASON NEARS
## Twiggs Praises Golf Team; Little, Seaver Hold Course Record 
### Jay Graves 
The best varsity golf aggregation
that Stanford ever had, according to
Eddie Twiggs, golfing instructor, is
rapidly rounding into shape, and
should be in top-notch form by the
time first matches roll around about
February 1.
Charlie Seaver, Harry "Bud"
Eichelberger, Stew Hawley, and
Lawson Little are at present holding
down the top four places on the
varsity ladder.
Seaver and Little, both able to
shoot around the par 71 course in
a consistent 70 to 72, are at present
co-holders of the course record of
69, which is two under the theo
retically perfect score.
Dwyer Shows Good Card
Stew Hawley swings his sticks
around in a normal 72 to 75 shots,
and Eddie Twiggs is counting on
him and Bud Eicheiberger with a
usual 72 to 74, lo do some real pow
erful shooting when club matches
are played.
Tom Dwyer is beginning to learn
the Stanford course now, and is
showing the 71, 72, 73 card mark
ings that he is capable of. Incident
ally, it's that ability that won him
a place in the National Open two
years ago.
Giddings Promising
Dick Giddings, who has been tak
ing one ladder beating after an
other, got off the dime last week
and began to show just what he is
really capable of shooting. He beat
Ed Beuter 2 up without any trouble,
and, according to Twiggs, he should
be up among the leaders by the end
of January.
Dick was State Junior College
champion last year.
Gene Brown is doing a little bet
ter playing than he was during the
first of the quarter and he has
moved up to fifth place and is
threatening to crash the main team*
With the present top aggregation
and plenty of new material to de
velop, Twiggs believes that the
Stanford golf squad should come
close to being undefeated during the
coming season.
