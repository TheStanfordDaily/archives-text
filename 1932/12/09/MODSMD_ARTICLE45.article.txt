# U.S.C.-NOTRE DAME CLASH TOMORROW IN L. A. STADIUM
## Outcome of Annual Tilt May Give Ramblers National Football Title 
### Dick Rodda 
As the first of the year draws
near the number of football games
throughout the nation on each suc
cessive Saturday rapidly diminishes,
but this week the quantity is offset
by the quality as the U.S.C. Trojans
and the Notre Dame Ramblers clash i
tomorrow afternoon in the Olympic j
Stadium in Los Angeles.
It is their annual grid classic and j
as usual brings them together us the |
country's leading contenders for the
national pigskin title. Should the
Ramblers win, they will have a defi
nite claim on the mythical title
which would be strengthened if the
Trojans should turn around and
lick Pitt on New Years' Day. On
the other hand, if U.S.C. wins both
games, it will undoubtedly be
awarded the championship. The
only other schools under considera
tion are Pittsburgh and Michigan.
Because of the importance of the
contest and the traditional rivalry
between the two schools, the 101,000
scats in the Olympic Stadium will
probably be filled to capacity, mak
ing it Ihe largest crowd of the 1932
football season. Only 15,000 seats
remained on public sale with the
game no more than 48 hours away.
This crowd will have been rivalled
this year by the capacity audience
that witnessed one of the Olympic
events in the same stadium last
summer.
Lack of direct comparison between
the two elevens makes it almost im
possible to select a favorite for the
classic. Eastern coaches and sports
writers pick the Ramblers despite
their loss to Pittsburgh, declaring
that the Panthers caught them on ,
an off-day.
