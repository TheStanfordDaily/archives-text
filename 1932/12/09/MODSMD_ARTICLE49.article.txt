I THE ONE THING THAT puzzles
us in (he attitude of the Los Angeles
Stanford alumni, is that they want
a graduate coaching system here,
and they want Ernie Nevers too.
Louis Vincente, former Card foot
ball and basketball player put this
up to them at the meeting yester
day when he reminded the boys
that Ernie never graduated from
Stanford. And yet they left their
instructions to the committee that
is coming up here just as they were.
The instructions include recom
mendations for both the graduate
system and Nevers.
There is no use getting excited
over the fact that the blonde terror
doesn't hold a degree from the Farm.
It is no disgrace. He just doesn't,
and that is all there is to it.
ONE THING THAT IS CER
TAINLY in "Clipper" Smith's fa
vor, is that he is not only a coach
but an instructor too. We aren't
suggesting that he would be an
instructor here, but at least he is
qualified. And that, believe it or
not, is something.
THE VOTE OF APPRECIATION
that the team gave Ernie Cnddel in
electing him captain for the past
season was a fine thing for them
to do.
Ernie started the season with all
the chance in the world of being an
Ail-American. He had the reputa
tion and the ability. All that he had i
to do was come through, and then
injuries hit him, and he never had I
a chance to show what he can reallv !
do.

For the benefit of the doubters
around here, the axe was NEVER
a football trophy. And it was re
gained in the SPRING of 1930.
