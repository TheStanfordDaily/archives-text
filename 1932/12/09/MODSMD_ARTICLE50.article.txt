# INDIAN POLOISTS SHOW GOOD FORM, DOPESTERS CLAIM
## "Boys Playing Smarter Polo This Year, That's All," Gordan Says 
### Bill Myers 
As the Card poloists get ready to I
stow away their spurs until next j
year, dopesters who have been j
watching the team this season say \
that the Redshirts show greater j
promise than any outfit here in re- j
cent years.
This cheery outlook is all the I
more remarkable when it is re- j
membered that there is only one j
veteran of last year's squad back i
this season. Captain Pete Gillham j
is the old-timer, and while his team- i
mates Luppen and Melone were used
some as substitutes last year, they
never held down regular berths.
The fourth man, Johnny Myers, is
starting his first year of playing, j
Weather Aids
Old Man Weather is partly re- j
sponsible for the unexpected flashi- j
ness. Not a single practice session j
has been missed because of muddy j
fields, Last fall nearly half the j
scrimmages had to be called off j
due to the continual rains. I
The Card riders split their two .
games this fall. The first with the
Menlo Circus Club was won 7-6, !
while a later match with the San 1
Mateo Club went down on the '
boards as 10-8 defeat for the Cards, j
Both these teams are anxious to !
meet the Redshirts in games next!'
quarter, and matches will likely be j,
arranged.

The San Mateo outfit lauded the j i
