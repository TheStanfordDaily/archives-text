# HOOP COACH SEES FASTER TILTS UNDER NEW RULES
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
That a faster game will result |
from the new 10- and 3-second
1 regulations adopted in the 1932-33
| basketball rules is the belief of John |
j Bunn, coach of the Stanford varsity. !
The new changes are the first
j drastic revisions made in the 14
! original rules in the 40 years bas- j
j ketball has existed, and they have
! caused considerable comment |
i among fans, players, coaches, and i
i officials.
The 10-second rule, designed to i
j eliminate stalling, states that a team i
! in possession of the ball in its back- !
' court must bring the ball across a i
| center line within 10 seconds. Once '
j acros sthe center line, the ball can j
| be returned to the back court only j
| after a shot for the basket, an out- j
j of-bounds play, a held ball, or after
! the opposing team has gained pos- j
! session of the ball and lost it. The'
i penalty for failure to comply with j
I the rule awards the ball to the de- j
J fense out of bounds.
Bunn believes that the rule is one â€¢
of the best in the book because it j
will bring all of the offensive men |
; into the forecourt and will encour
age quick-breaking offense, thus 1
| speeding "up the game. This should
do much to revive the spectator's !
interest, which had begun to wane j
in recent years due to the preva- '
last month. "Your bunch is faster j
and smarter and just generally bet- |
ter than it was last year," one of ;
the San Mateans told Captain Dick
Gordan after the game.
Gordan himself is perhaps the j
most optinjistic of them all. "The ;
boys axe just playing smarter polo
this year, that's all," he said.
"They're playing a better game right
now than they were after nine
months' practice last year. And the
men coming up for next year look
better than any I've coached in the
last five years."

| It nee of stalling, Bunn said.
; The change will not alter styles
I of defense to any extent but should
| make for more aggressive play,
I Bunn thinks. Neil her should it
I cause a great number of penalties.
In the first major game played
j under the new rules, between Kan
sas and Kansas Aggies, neither team
( was called for violation.
The three-second rule states that
ii an offensive player has possession
i of the ball in his opponent's free
| throw lane with his back to the
! basket, he must get the ball out of
i the lane in three seconds or the
ball is awarded to the defensive
I team out of bounds. The rule is de
' signed to speed up play under the
j basket and has been used success
fully by professional teams for sev-
J eral years.
