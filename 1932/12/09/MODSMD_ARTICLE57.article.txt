# FROSH HOOPSTERS TRAIN FOR U. S. F.
## 
### 
When Stanford's frosh basketball
squad meets the U.S.F. first-year
men on January 7, Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw hopes to have one of the
strongest freshman teams in recent
years somewhere near the pink of
condition.
Bradshaw, who has only recently
joined the team, has already cut the
squad from GO to 20, and has con
tinued Varsity Coach John Bunn's
practice in changing the styles of
many of the players. The policy of
altering the various high-school
forms to that used by the varsity
has been used successfully for sev
eral seasons and so far this year
Bradshaw has expressed satisfac
tion with the results.
Since early in the fall many of
the cagers have been working out
daily. This was accomplished first
under the direction of two varsity
candidates and later under that of
Coach Bunn. Bunn, as well as the
others, were pleased with the
finesse shown by several of the
candidates and were particularly
receptive to the work of Addie Bar
nett, Ralph Manion, Jacob Katz,
Harry Dutton, and Dave Farber.
With the close of the football sea
son several other experienced play
ers joined the squad and among
those who survived the cut were
John Reisner, Woody Adams, Don
Maentz, and Alec Trompas.
The encounter with the Dons will
undoubtedly be of a very stiff na
ture as is evidenced by the in
creased interests prevailing in fresh
man sports at the San Francisco
school. However, with several weeks
of practice remaining before the en
gagement, Stanford hopes have
risen markedly.
