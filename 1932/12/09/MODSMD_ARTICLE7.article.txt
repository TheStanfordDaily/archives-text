# Campus Laboratory Gets New Measuring Machine
## 
### 
Measurements as fine as .00001 of
an inch are possible since the in
stallation of a new measuring ma
chine in the mechanical engineering
laboratory.
The new equipment, scientifically
accurate, is capable of measuring
the almost imperceptible increases
in the size of steel bars caused by
temperature rises of a few degrees.
It will be used to aid manufac
turers on the West Coast and for
the instruction of United States
Army reserve officers, according to
M. S. Hugo, instructor in mechanical
engineering.
