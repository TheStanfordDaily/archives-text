vidual letters to campus residents, j
the Student Emergency Employment i
Fund Committee, appointed by Dr. J
Swain last quarter, will begin this \
week a strenuous program of money |
and job-hunting to alleviate the I
emergency wants of needy students. |
Inaugurated last year when the J
number of students out of work arid
hungry grew to proportions too t
great to be relieved through regular |
channels of aid, the committee en- j
countered conditions cf privation j
among students surprising even to '
its own members. The degree of its I
success in meeting the emergency is '
indicated in the letter printed in ad- j
joining columns, which campus resi
dents wiil receive in the mails this |

the need for it, will be even greater
this year was apparent yesterday in J
the Administration Building.
The Dean's office reported appli- j
cation for tuition notes far exceed- J
ing the normal number. The Em- i
ployment Office of Mrs. Spenner re- j
vealed that more students are seek- j
ing jobs this quarter tl;an ever be- !
fore in the history of Stanford. And j
a flood of students sought loans of
SI4 with which to pay the fees j
which their tuition notes did not |
cover.

Committee members see in these
facts an indication that there will i
be throughout the winter quarter a j
greatly increased number of under- '
graduates scraping through on a J
bare minimum, unable to purchase j
small necessities, or to pay such!
small obligations as syllabus fees.
Launched on its program with a
substantial sum realized at the j
Women's Carnival last quarter, the
committee is redoubling its activities,
to meet wants such as these, which j
are expected to tax its funds to the ;
limit.
