ker and fishermen's representative,
James Grafton Rogers, assistant Sec

clarify the situation now facing the
fishing industry here.
Six market fishing boats have
been seized and five are being held
at prison anchorage at Ensenada,

their boats were confiscated on the
high seas, where Mexico is without
