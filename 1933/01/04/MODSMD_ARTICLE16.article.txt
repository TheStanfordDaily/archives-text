KOLESNIVOKO, U.S.S.R., Jan. 3
(/Piâ€”Five men were sentenced to
death today for the murder of a
thirteen-year-old boy who had ex
posed them to the authorities as
"class enemies." The case was an
almost exact parallel of the recent
murder of two young brothers in
the nearby village of -Gerasimovka
under similar circumstances. Thir
teen-year-old Nikolai Maikotin was
waylaid and shot to death by Ku
laks whom he had accused of steal
ing from collective farms.
