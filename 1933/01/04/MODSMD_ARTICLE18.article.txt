# STUDENT RELIEF APPEAL
## 
### 
To (lumpus Residents:
Last year, under the inspiration and leadership of the
National Committee on I ncmployinent, every local com
munity raised lunds to meet the needs of its own nnt'in
ployed. Jlere, on the Stanford Campus, the unemployment
situation was eonfined mainly to the special problems of
the student hody and, by agreement with the Mayor's
Committee of Palo Alto, we raised our own money, ap
plied for more work for students and administered both
as a Students' Emergency Kmploymcnt Fund.
Although this relief work did not get underway last
year until the spring vacation, the report of the committee
in charge showed, at the end of the term, ;i total of
had been received from individual residents and from
campus groups. Much additional paid work also was se
cured. With this comparatively small sum, carefully used
as a revolving loan lund, 1.52 cases of student emergency
need were investigated and 121 were cared for. Many of
these loans were for small amounts to students who could
not earn sufficient money to meet all their needs for rent,
food, books, syllabus fees and similar cash requirements.
The majority of these loans were worked out during the
term, in useful jobs on the Campus grounds, but wherever
possible cash was repaid into the fund by the borrowers
and re-loaned to others. As a result of repayments from
vacation earnings, the committee this fall still had funds
to meet many of the emergencies of the first quarter. Hut
the fund now is exhausted—with every indication that
students' needs this winter will be more pressing than they
were last year.
We, therefore, are sending out again an appeal to all
residents of the campus for help along any of these three
lines, which proved most practical last year:
1. Send us your contributions in money.
2. Subscribe a given amount payable in monthly in
stalments.
.'5. Stir up some kind of useful work for which you can
employ students and pay them in cash.
On the campus we are not approached for money for
Community Chest Funds. The Stanford students are our
community. Their emergency needs, during this difficult
winter, will be our most immediate problem.
May we ask you to help to the extent of your ability, in
the way that you find possible?
Sincerely yours,
Ai.mon K. Roth, CJuiiriium
