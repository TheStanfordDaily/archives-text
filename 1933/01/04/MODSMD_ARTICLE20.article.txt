NEW YORK, Jan. 3 (/P>—Espe
cially in "troublous times like these,"
John Masefield said tonight, poetry
"gives a great deal of pleasure in
this vale of tears."
"And that's something." said the
poet laureate of England, who ar
rived here today with Mrs. Mase
field. Later they will go to Chandler,
Arizona, for a winter vacation.
"People have lost the art of listen
ing. A poet lives too remote from
his audience. He thinks he's not
wanted. He takes to gin, then to
opium, and then he dies.
"I have not used tobacco or alco
holic stimulants for twenty-five
years. I work better without them.
All great poets are temperate. Shelley
lived on bread, water, and raisins.
Milton drank only water. Keats
drank for the taste, not the cxhiliar
ation."
