# Lincoln Steffens To Talk On Soviet Russia Friday
## 
### 
Lincoln Steffens, one-time muck
raker and "America's greatest re- j
porter," will lecture before the j
American Russian Institute at 8:15 j
o'clock Friday evening in the Audi
torium of the Women's City Club, ,
465 Post Street, San Francisco. His !
subject will be, "Russia Has It."
Stelfens is one of the few great j
liberals who has claimed liberalism j
to be a failure. He is now seeking j
other solutions to the social dilemma |
with zest and eagerness. The con- j
elusions he has reached will be pre- j
sented Friday evening.
The lecture will be open to the
public.
