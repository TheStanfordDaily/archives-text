# COMMITTEE 10 DISCUSS COACH ISSUE TONIGHT
## B.A.C. Members Plan To Consider Candidates At Union Dinner NEVERS OUT OF RACE Action Will Be In Nature Of Recommendation 
### 
Members of the staff committee of
the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol were scheduled to gather for a
discussion of the football coaching
situation here at a dinner meeting
in the Stanford Union this evening.
Although the matter will not be
finally decided tonight, much head
way is anticipated in the nature of
eliminating candidates and weighing
the alumni influences that have been
brought to bear on the situation
since Glenn S. ("Pop") Warner an
nounced his resignation unexpected
ly three weeks ago.
Alunuii Contacted
Since the last meeting of the
board, the week before the end of
autumn quarter, members have con
tacted important graduate groups in
various parts of the state and have
sought to create a unanimous sup
port of whatever action the B.A.C.
may take—either tomorrow night at
the general meeting, or at some fu
ture date.
Sentiment on Warner's successor
appeal's to have narrowed down to
Claude E. ("Tiny") Thornhill, Pop's
assistant and line coach here for the
last nine years, and Maurice ("Clip
per") Smith, popular Santa Clara
University mentor.
Nevers Out
Ernie Nevers, former Cardinal all -
American fullback who last season
coached the Grays, retired from the
running ten days ago, announcing
that he preferred to get more sea
soning under a capable head coach
before aspiring to an important po
sition. Nevers will undoubtedly be
retained as an assistant coach here,
and will probably be advanced to a
varsity position.
Although principal interest centers
on the new head of Stanford's grid
iron destinies, board members arc
still racking their brains trying to
fill the hole that is scheduled to be
left by the departure of J. C.
('Chuck") Winterburn, coach of the
undefeated Stanford freshman foot
ballers, who has been recommended
by Warner for the backfield coach
ing job at Temple, Pop's new school.
Freshman Job Open
Whether this part of the tangle
will be solved tonight or tomorrow
remains to be seen. So far, members
have concentrated their efforts on
the varsity muddle, leaving the
freshman job a wide open affair.
Some people consider the possi
bilities of Jimmy Bradshaw, diminu
tive backfield coach of the varsity
this yefar, being shifted back to his
old job with the frosh. Bradshaw has
also been mentioned as a successor
to "Swede" Righter, who vacated his
job as head coach of College of
Pacific—the school that has been
linked with the name of Amos
Alonzo Stagg. retired Chicago Uni
versity veteran.
Board Recommends
Whatever action takes place this
evening is supposed to be only in
the nature of a recommendation to
the 8.A.C., which body will in turn
draw a conclusion on the basis of
