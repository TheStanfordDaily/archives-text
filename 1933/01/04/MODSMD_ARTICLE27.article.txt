# WHAT, NO REG DANCE?
## 
### 
It's tough enough to conic hack to a dreary, rain-soaked
campus in the dead of one of the "hardest" winters with
scarcely enough coin of the realm to register; it's tough
< nough to find ranks of comrades thinned, to find those
friends gone who might have escaped the scholarship axe,
or the depression, but were not agile enough to dodge
them both.
But one can accept those hardships as Stanford's share
;i! ;i lime when everybody is taking il on the nose. One can
look at (hem, sigh, perhaps, and wonder what the matter
is with the country, or with the world.
But when a returning student lines up a date for the
Mcgistration Dance, festivity time-honored, only to find
I! iat (here is no Registration Dance, he begins to wonder
what the matter is with Stanford.
And maybe he's right, at that. Something must be the
matter with Stanford when il forsakes a dance that has
become almost a tradlion at the very lime when it ought
to be scheduling infinitely more campus dances, good but
inexpensive.
I liable to afford the high-priced San Francisco variety
of entertainment, men must have campus dances or do
without dancing. I nless a few organizations hereabouts
wake up and realize that local hops will be more popular
than ever this quarter, and will pay, the sorry result will
he exactly that.
Perhaps the Ex-Committee can do something about it.
