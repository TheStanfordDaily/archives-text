# HOLLYWOOD'S CHRISTMAS
## 
### 
II li;ts been reported that Santa Claus failed to pay 11 is
customary visit this Christmas to the hoys and "iris who
live in the vicinity of Hollywood Boulevard. The reason
for this tragic occurrence lias heen traced to the confusion
in the mind of the venerable benefactor as to just where
he was when he sailed over the avenue. When interviewed
later, Santa explained that he saw no evidence of the neces
sary Yulelide spirit, lie imagined he had stumbled into
a publicity agent's private gallery of film stars.
Those privileged persons who had the unusual ex
perience of visiting Hollywood this Christmas will under
stand the Old Man's oversight. On each lamp-post on both
sides of the street, encircled by the symbolic wreath, an
ovcrlife size picture of a movie star gazed down on the
populace. So that there would be 110 chance of mistaking
them for angels the star's name was attached to each pic
lure.
Whether the originator of Ibis idea felt that there was
some connection between a Hollywood star and the Rctlile
heni slar is not known. The idea might occur, of course, to
anyone steeped in the subtle symbolism of the motion pic
lures. However, Ilie more common-place individual is only
struck with the glaring bad taste of tlie display.
And then somebody remarked, "Whose birthdav is
Christmas, anyway?"
