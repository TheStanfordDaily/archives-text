# FOOTBALL COMES IN-DOORS
## 
### 
Final labs were held Monday in the American col
legian's major subject, conversationally speaking. From
now until the starting whistle next September, that subject,
which is. of course, football, becomes perforce a science of
mere theory and conjecture. The final demonstrations,
which occurred simultaneously in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, gave some 1 10,000 attending students very con
vincing object lessons, which will bear discussion for some,
at.least until .the completion of men's rushing here at
Stanford.
Down in Pasadena (to which city we apologize for hav
ing previously referred to the game site as Los Angeles)
the answer to an ever-arising question was demonstrated
"Which is the best college football team in the eountrv?"
Eighly-soine-thousand Southern Californians got the an
swer Southern California but there was no wholesale
enlightening, for most of those eighty-some-thousand knew
the answer beforehand, and only went to the Pittsburgh
game with sort of a "repetition for emphasis" attitude.
The lesson was of an entirely different nature in Kczar
Stadium. There the kids learned that an All-American
football player, transplanted from bis native sports page
to the gridiron, is pretty apt to be just another football
player. Ihe lesson ot that San Francisco labratorv demon
stration was brought out with vividness and subtlety the
conclusion was driven home by a young man from over
Berkeley way, not an All-American, whose sports page
career had been jusl one long hard-luck story.
Thai's all for Ibis season, pupils. A little more such
education may be a dangerous thing for you. You may
quil going to college football games (or paying so much
to go to Ihein), or you may quit fighting over the sports
section of your home paper.
