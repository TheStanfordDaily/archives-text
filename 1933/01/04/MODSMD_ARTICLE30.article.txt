BLISS VIA IGNORANCE
Life at Stanford is a pleasant
ritual. Wishing Bill, Mary, and June
a "nice vacation" ends the quarter.
Inquiring whether Bill, Mary, and
June enjoyed a "nice vacation" be
gins the quarter. The intermediate
time is spent studying, necking,
sleeping, eating, and making checks
payable to Stanford University. Some
don't study. This routine is repeated
three times to complete the academic
year. And thus thi tri-cycle of exis
tence peddles on in idyllic sweetness
and simplicity.
Of course, in a vague sort of way,
the campus realizes that things are
happening on the outside. News
papers, salesmen, and checks from
home filter farmward every now and
then, creating a faint tie with the
great big World. But there is no
definite realization of what the score
is. That is natural and naturally sad.
So it is that Stanfordites realize
that .there is such a thing as a de
pression. It means generally a de
crease of trade and particularly thin
ner checks from home. But it is
something ■ vague and nebulous. It
lacks the punch of reality. It is a
picture and not a living thing. One
needs* several days of study in a big
city to know what the depression
really is.
One may get his course in the de
pression east of Spring street in Los
Angeles—or south of Market in
Frisco. The depression is more than
political platitudes. It is shabby men
with unshaven faces and grimy
hands. Fourteen million unemployed
is a large figure. It means hunger
and cold.
Even with a keen imagination
coupled with a twenty-minute wait
in the Cellar—it is difficult to com
prehend what hunger means. It is
only a word. It becomes a horrible
reality in the sullen stares of corner
groups south of Market street. It is
most unpleasant to consider the
matter.
But we in collcge must. For the
hunger—or the bread and bean diets
of unemployed millions—will be a
factor in political and social life long
after Rotary luncheon speakers are
telling you—"l told you America
would come back." America will
probably come up but it won't bo
the same America that went down.
As the hei'alded leaders of tomor

row, college men (and women, too,
I suppose) will have to understand
these forces that are dominant in this
era which historians will probably
refer to as "post-war deflation."
Whether the tickers only tick or
buzz, the Quad looks about the same.
Therefore many students choose to
ignore the depression entirely as
something foreign. It, however, is
a mortal pain in the neck to mil
lions. While not yet impending on
the campus—it is an element that
should be considered in relation to
the scale of campus activities.
"Depression?—Oh, yeah'" — is a
callous, cruel, and hopelessly stupid
reaction.
