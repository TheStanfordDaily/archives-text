a Cuba sugar, but they didn't
Havana cream. So when a car came
Ho'ng-Kongin' around the corner, a
man who had stepped up to the Port,
Said, 'I've only a few minutes. I
have to catch a Cairo liner in the
morning. How about a song?' For
mosa part I had a bad Kobe in my
head. Nevada chance. Then up Spo
kane (Anne was the little gal I Ta
coma one night) 'Let's Sing Sing
Ruinier Shine.' But the boys agreed
on Salem, Snlem Over the Bounding
Maine. After that it Tokio some time
to get my Bering, Sea? Burma trou
sers if I didn't Louisianaâ€”l haven't
Seine her since. So Ceylon, folks,
Ceylon!"
