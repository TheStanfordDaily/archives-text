IHE MAURICE COL BOURNE -
BARRY JONES COMPANY: The
Queen's Husband. At the Colum
bia Theatre.
This company, composed for the
most part of competent actors, and
starring the excellent Barry Jones,
is presenting its London production
of The Queen's Husband.
It is interesting to note the differ
ences between the American man
ner of production and that of the
more placid Maurice Colbourne.
Gordon Davis' production on the
campus several years ago was played
at a far more rapid pace than the
j current production is, and, after
| building for two acts to a much
higher climax than the English com
pany chooses to play, slipped quietly
down into a resolving third act. Col
bourne's building instead for a cli
mactic final act is more effective
than Davis's, but for American audi
-1 ences the slower tempo is less satis
■ fying than the fastcr-pactd manner.
The play, usually named hurriedly
a satire, is more essentially a varia
tion upon the theme of the turning
i worm. The satire upon monarchy is
constantly evident, but less so than
! the rise of the meek king. It is sa
| tiric, rather than a true satire.
Several members of the company
j read lines smoothly and well, but
j are less adept at fitting the action to
1 the word. There are occasional slips
into an exaggeration of gesture.
; Barry Jones's King Eric is, how
ever, consistently excellent; he is a
comedian of accomplishment.
1 But on the whole the company
j plays this amusing comedy well.
Their performance more than justi
fies a visit to the Columbia. The
Queen's Husband will give way next
Monday night to Bernard Shaw's
newest play, Too True to Be Good,
i a more difficult comedy which will
! test them more keenly.

****THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE At

the Curran Theatre.
While this is not an especially
good operetta the cause of its popu
larity is not difficult to find. It has
all the color and life one would ex

pect in a musical show; it moves
along at a fairly rapid tempo (with
a few appalling gaps), and the dia
log is usually amusing; although it
is as varied as a revue it holds to
gether fairly well.
The plot is even worse than that of
most operettas. One only needs a
framework, but this one is far too
stale. Also, its melodramatics are ri
diculous—possibly they were meant
to be so, but the cast took the grand
denunciations seriously where, by
burlesquing, they might have spared
the audience considerable pain. The
dialog is mainly rapid fire repartee,
frequently bordering on vulgarity
but sufficiently clever to escape this.
These rapid remarks naturally are
stupid occasionally, bu< here this is
avoided more successfully than in
most similar attempts.
The musical score is uneven; some
numbers are excellent, but many
fail entirely. The wide variety in the
music helped considerably. But
somehow, the score seems less im
portant here than in most operettas.
The cast was good, with no one
outstanding. Olga Baclanova gave
the most intelligent performance,
taking her part less seriously than
the others, and had the best singing
voice. Helen Gahagan did her role
with surprising spontaneity, but her
singing was not up to standard. Paul
Gregory was the weakest of the
principals, being far too stiff and
overplaying the romantic scenes
badly. His singing was fairly good.
If one is not expecting too much
the play is excellent entertainment,
but the bad plot, the tendency of the
dialog toward monotony, and the
uneven music rank it below Jerome
Kern's other work.
