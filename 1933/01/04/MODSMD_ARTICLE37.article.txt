# SHALDACH DEFEATS EAST IN NEW YEAR'S TILT
## 
### Dick Strouse 
In a loyal and generous attempt
to aid charity and the Eastern all
stars, Notre Dame's all-American
Joe Kurth crashed a beautiful right
hook to the outthrust jaw of pugilis
tic Ralph Stone, former fighting
footballer and basketeer from Cali
fornia, and furnished u deserved
thrill to thousands of pantalooncd
and fezed Shriners who staged their
annual East-West New Year's Day
game for the gain of little crippled
children.
The Kurth crash occurred in the
final quarter of a goodnntured foot
ball game, and it sent the California
wingman spinning backward with
his head flung loosely back as
though temporarily detached from
his body. Bill Morgan of Oregon,
Max Krauze of Gonzaga, and an
other Western star or two felt the
insult that had been done their be
loved West by Kurth's ungentle
manly act, and when they had fin
ished persuading Kurth that Cali
fornia's and Washington's and Ore
gon't sunsets are quite superior to
Indiana's, ail-American Joe had
played enough football for the day.
Denny Intercedes
It took Wallace Denny and a bat
talion to clear the field of the mass
of debris that was Kurth, and when
quiet was once again restored to
Kezar Stadium and while the Shrin
ers and those whom they had per
suaded to purchase tickets and those
who received comps were asking
each other in non-sectional curiosity
just exactly who hit who, the game
continued and was finally won by
Hank Sehaldach, 21 to 13.
The East scored first, and although
a kindly timer allowed the boys to
play a first quarter that must have
lasted 40 minutes, the half ended
with Harry Newman and his fellow
Eastern stars out ahead, (5 to 0. Dur
ing the intermission, the San Fran
cisco taxi-drivers' band outplayed

the San Francisco policemen, but
the real honors of the day went to a
little dog that defeated a pseudo-
Chinese team of Chinamen and a
pseud, i-red team of non-Stanford
Indians in the gridiron classic of two
continents and two civilizations.
All 21 Schaldach's
Sehaldach, who was hard luck for
his opponents Monday, then scored
all 21 of the West's points, and made
valid the question, "Just what is the
basis of all-American selections?"
Sehaldach scored two of his touch
downs around all-American Paul
Moss' ends; he made all-American
Roy Horstmann look like a poorly
driven freight train by comparison
with himself; he ran through all-
American Bob Smith; and he ran
over all-American Joe Kurth. All-
American Harry Newman was pretty
good.
Other Western stars shone Mon
day, although the football game was
close. Morgan and Johnson of Utah
pulled a very surprising stunt when
they made the experts' prediction
correct for once and broke up most
of the East's running plays; Molinari
and Senn were good guards; Stafford
of Texas was the best back other
than Schaldach; Koy, also of Texas,
was the hardest plunger; Hokufl of
Nebraska played plenty of end; and
Brovelli of St. Mary's and Cadell
and Colvin of Stanford received a
big hand from the crowd and also
played.
Wells Smiles
With the exception of the Kurth
flare-up, the game was a happy-go
lucky affair typified by the smile
worn by big Marsh Wells of Minne
sota. Wells smiled when he hit and
when he was hit, and he came out
of the game twice, smiling and
laughing to little Andy Kerr. Even
Babe Hollingberry and Dick Hanley
smiled, for the winner was not
nearly as important Monday as was
the crowd of crippled children.

a kindly timer allowed the boys to
play a first quarter that must have
lasted 40 minutes, the half ended
with Harry Newman and his fellow
Eastern stars out ahead, (5 to 0. Dur
ing the intermission, the San Fran
cisco taxi-drivers' band outplayed

the San Francisco policemen, but
the real honors of the day went to a
little dog that defeated a pseudo-
Chinese team of Chinamen and a
pseud, i-red team of non-Stanford
Indians in the gridiron classic of two
continents and two civilizations.
All 21 Schaldach's
Sehaldach, who was hard luck for
his opponents Monday, then scored
all 21 of the West's points, and made
valid the question, "Just what is the
basis of all-American selections?"
Sehaldach scored two of his touch
downs around all-American Paul
Moss' ends; he made all-American
Roy Horstmann look like a poorly
driven freight train by comparison
with himself; he ran through all-
American Bob Smith; and he ran
over all-American Joe Kurth. All-
American Harry Newman was pretty
good.
Other Western stars shone Mon
day, although the football game was
close. Morgan and Johnson of Utah
pulled a very surprising stunt when
they made the experts' prediction
correct for once and broke up most
of the East's running plays; Molinari
and Senn were good guards; Stafford
of Texas was the best back other
than Schaldach; Koy, also of Texas,
was the hardest plunger; Hokufl of
Nebraska played plenty of end; and
Brovelli of St. Mary's and Cadell
and Colvin of Stanford received a
big hand from the crowd and also
played.
Wells Smiles
With the exception of the Kurth
flare-up, the game was a happy-go
lucky affair typified by the smile
worn by big Marsh Wells of Minne
sota. Wells smiled when he hit and
when he was hit, and he came out
of the game twice, smiling and
laughing to little Andy Kerr. Even
Babe Hollingberry and Dick Hanley
smiled, for the winner was not
nearly as important Monday as was
the crowd of crippled children.
In a loyal and generous attempt
to aid charity and the Eastern all
stars, Notre Dame's all-American
Joe Kurth crashed a beautiful right
hook to the outthrust jaw of pugilis
tic Ralph Stone, former fighting
footballer and basketeer from Cali
fornia, and furnished u deserved
thrill to thousands of pantalooncd
and fezed Shriners who staged their
annual East-West New Year's Day
game for the gain of little crippled
children.
The Kurth crash occurred in the
final quarter of a goodnntured foot
ball game, and it sent the California
wingman spinning backward with
his head flung loosely back as
though temporarily detached from
his body. Bill Morgan of Oregon,
Max Krauze of Gonzaga, and an
other Western star or two felt the
insult that had been done their be
loved West by Kurth's ungentle
manly act, and when they had fin
ished persuading Kurth that Cali
fornia's and Washington's and Ore
gon't sunsets are quite superior to
Indiana's, ail-American Joe had
played enough football for the day.
Denny Intercedes
It took Wallace Denny and a bat
talion to clear the field of the mass
of debris that was Kurth, and when
quiet was once again restored to
Kezar Stadium and while the Shrin
ers and those whom they had per
suaded to purchase tickets and those
who received comps were asking
each other in non-sectional curiosity
just exactly who hit who, the game
continued and was finally won by
Hank Sehaldach, 21 to 13.
