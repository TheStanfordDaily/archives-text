# All-Americans Perform For Campus Fans
## 
### 
Several hundred Stanford fans
were treated to the spectacle of
watching five all-American football
stars work out daily during the
week following Christmas when the
East squad, coached by Andy Kerr,
formerly of Stanford and now at
Colgate, and Dick Hanley came to
the coast to play the all-star West
team in the annual Shrine charity
game at the Kezar Stadium, San
Francisco.
Headed by Harry Newman of
Michigan, Ray Horstman and Paul
Moss of Purdue, Bob Smith of Col
gate, and Joe Kurth of Notre Dame,
the East gave the home towners an
exhibition in football as it is played
only when (he players have nothing
except a good time on their mind.
Other members of the squad in
cluded Gil Berry of Illinois, Pug
lientner of Northwestern, Bob Rowe
of Colgate, Bart Viviano of Cornell,
Joe Zapustas of Fordham, Dick
Fencl of Northwestern, and Jose
Martinez-Zorrilla of Cornell.
Former Indian Stars Play
Practices were devoted to team
work and scrimmage against a team
composed of members of every trade
imaginable. Ernie Nevers was the
mainstay of this squad and his
team-mates were Tom Lambert,
Jack Holwerda, Bob O'Connor of
last season's varsity, Dal Marvil, for
mer All-American and present as
sistant coach at U.S.F., Walt Hci
neeke, former Stanford player, Don
Thompson, radio announcer, and
Chuck Winterburn, Stanford's fresh
man coach.
Although the East was by far the
superior squad, much opposition was
incurred when plays were attempted
through the line. Dal Marvil and
Ernie Nevers were mainly respon
sible for such a defense, but due to
insufficient conditioning, were un
able to stop the passing attack which
was functioning to perfection for the
East. On Tuesday, at least five
touchdowns were made in this man
ner.
Warner Coaches Opposition
Pop Warner did a little impromptu
coaching when the East was in pos
session of the ball and succeeded in
on one occasion directing a success
ful "Warner forward lateral."
Harry Newman gave the most sat
isfactory showing with Gil Berry,
Paul Moss, and Pug Rentner, also
looking very well. The combina
tions of Newman, Berry, and Rent
ner to Moss, Fencl and Martinez-
Zorrilla worked time after time and
impressed spectators with its finesse.

Practices were devoted to team
work and scrimmage against a team
composed of members of every trade
imaginable. Ernie Nevers was the
mainstay of this squad and his
team-mates were Tom Lambert,
Jack Holwerda, Bob O'Connor of
last season's varsity, Dal Marvil, for
mer All-American and present as
sistant coach at U.S.F., Walt Hci
neeke, former Stanford player, Don
Thompson, radio announcer, and
Chuck Winterburn, Stanford's fresh
man coach.
Although the East was by far the
superior squad, much opposition was
incurred when plays were attempted
through the line. Dal Marvil and
Ernie Nevers were mainly respon
sible for such a defense, but due to
insufficient conditioning, were un
able to stop the passing attack which
was functioning to perfection for the
East. On Tuesday, at least five
touchdowns were made in this man
ner.
Warner Coaches Opposition
Pop Warner did a little impromptu
coaching when the East was in pos
session of the ball and succeeded in
on one occasion directing a success
ful "Warner forward lateral."
Harry Newman gave the most sat
isfactory showing with Gil Berry,
Paul Moss, and Pug Rentner, also
looking very well. The combina
tions of Newman, Berry, and Rent
ner to Moss, Fencl and Martinez-
Zorrilla worked time after time and
impressed spectators with its finesse.

Several hundred Stanford fans
were treated to the spectacle of

East squad, coached by Andy Kerr,
formerly of Stanford and now at
Colgate, and Dick Hanley came to
the coast to play the all-star West
team in the annual Shrine charity
game at the Kezar Stadium, San
Francisco.
Headed by Harry Newman of
Michigan, Ray Horstman and Paul
Moss of Purdue, Bob Smith of Col
gate, and Joe Kurth of Notre Dame,
the East gave the home towners an
exhibition in football as it is played
only when (he players have nothing
except a good time on their mind.
Other members of the squad in
cluded Gil Berry of Illinois, Pug
lientner of Northwestern, Bob Rowe
of Colgate, Bart Viviano of Cornell,
Joe Zapustas of Fordham, Dick
Fencl of Northwestern, and Jose
