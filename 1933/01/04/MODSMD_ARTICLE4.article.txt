# ROW READY FOR MEN'S RUSHING
## Council Discards Plan For Preferential Pledging 
### 
With the rushing and pledging
dates for the men of 1936 set for
January 9 to 13, inclusive, the houses
| up the Row are ready for a new
j class of nuggets.
An unlimited number of dates will
Ibe permitted the freshmen during
! the four days of rushing which will
consist of two periods a day, lunch
j and dinner, as has formerly been
i the custom. Final pledging will take
, place Friday, January 13.
These dates and the final plans for
j rushing were set at a meeting of the
j house presidents which took place
j the Tuesday before autumn quarter
i finals after the last issue of the
| Daily. It was also decided not to
! accept the preferential plan of pledg
! ing which would permit a fraternity
| to submit a second list of ten fresh
! men who would be substituted in
j case one of the first-choice men
i chose to pledge another house. The
i decisions of the house presidents
were passed upon by the Interfra
i ternity Board of Control which held
! its session immediately after the
| other meeting.
Invitation rushing cards will be on
| sale at the A.S.S.U. offices in the
! Old Union either late today or to
i morrow morning, according to Ike
Livermore, board chairman, who
also said that there probably would
be no meeting of either the house
presidents or the board thi.-> week
unless some unexpected business
! arose.
