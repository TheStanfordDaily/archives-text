According to a late Associated
Press dispatch, the Stanford
Cardinals nosed out the Univer
sity of Nebraska Cornhuskers in
a close hoop contest played at
Lincoln last night. The final score
was Stanford 21, Nebraska 17.
Copping two of their first nine
games and losing four others by |
close margins, Coach John Bunn's ,
barnstorming basketeers of Stanford
turned homeward today from an in
vasion that carried them as far east
as Kansas and Nebraska.
Admittedly weak, the Cards nev
ertheless gave some hopes of scor
ing victories in Pacific Coast Confer
ence play when they went on a
scoring spree in their December 24th
game to defeat University of Utah,
41-37, in the second game of the
Salt Lake City series. With every
man contributing at least three
points, and Jay Tod and Tom Cordry
hitting the hoop for eight, Bunn's
quintet took a 26-19 lead at the half
and counteracted the scoring of Kin
ner, sensational Ute frosh center,* to
squeeze out a win. Kinner tanked
17 points.
On the night before Utah won, 38-
28, after Stanford had held the Utes
ferdink was Colorado's best with
to a IG-12 score at the half. Papne
Palmer and Hal Edelen led the In- |
dian attack with eight and six points |
respectively. All of the 11 rambling
Redskins saw action.
The opening game of the trip,
played at Reno December 22, saw
University of Nevada winning, 25-
24, when Cordry unfortunately |
fouled Bledsoe, Wolfpack forward, j
in the closing seconds after the two
had battled all evening for high
point honors. Bledsoe made the |
winning point and at the same time j
claimed scoring honors with 14 to
the little Card forward's 13.
After the Utah series, Stanford
went on to Greeley, Colo., and
dropped a tough battle with the Col
orado Teachers. The mountain quin
tet increased its 12-10 half-time lead
to win, 32-24. It had been held to
two free throws in the first 13 min
utes of the game, but Blight, C. T.
center, led an attack too strong for
Stanford to halt.
Colorado University was next, the 1
two-game series on December 27
and 28 being split. Successfully
blanketing a second-half threat by
the Denver team, Stanford stretched
its half-time lead into a 25-21 vic
tory in the opener. Glasgow, Cord
ry, Schnabel and Weaver lead the
Cards with four points apiece. Lef
seven.
The five-point margin went the
other way the next night. Colorado
piled up an 11-0 lead early in the
game, managed to hold the half
time margin, 16-13 and squeaked
out with a 29-24 win. Lefferdink and
Cordry tied with 11 points each.
The trip saw Cordry continuing
his spectacular work of last season.
Palmer and Glasgow are even for
the other forward post, Edelen ap
pears to hold the edge at. center, and
three men—Tod, Hancock and Wea
ver—arc leading the candidates foi
guards.
