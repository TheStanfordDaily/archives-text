WITH TIIE STANFORD VAR
SITY basketball team due to ar
rive Friday and engage a lanky
but questionably powerful San
Francisco University Don quin
tet the following night, our
thoughts ramble back to last
year's season and some of the
things that Stanford should have
learned from it.
The team this year is reputed to
have even fewer prospects than last
year's aggregation possessed which
I is a long way from lending encour
-1 agement to a victory-starved Red
] shirt contingent. But one thing that
that excitable and often unreason-
I able body can do to help the team
j is to cut out about nine-tenths of
| the booing that seems to be a part
of the hoop games in the Stanford
Pavilion. Even were this constructive
move put into effect, Stanford would
still be about even with most bas
ketball audiences.
Another thing that will help a lot
is a lot of silence from these "Mon
day morning quarterbacks" who will
now become "crafty casaba cap
tains." There are more people
around here who can coach ever so
much better than John Bunn than
there are cops at a ball game. And
the only thing good about most of
; their opinions is that they are free.
The team went East on a barn
storming trip to gain experience,
NOT to pile up a lot of victories,
and (he fact that most of the
games were dropped does not
mean that Stanford hasn't a
chance to annex any conference
battles.

****THAT CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL

SCHEDULE for next year is cer
tainly an imposing test. Santa Clara,
a double-header, St. Mary's, Olym
pic Club, Washington State, South
| ern California, U.C.L.A., Washing
ton, Idaho, and Stanford. That
stretch from St. Mary's to Washing
ton will keep friend Ingram even
busier than he was this year.

BILL COEBUS, STANFORD'S

ALL-AMERICAN guard, led all the
Indian gridders in number of play
ing minutes during the 1932 season,
according to figures released yester
day. Corbus played a total of 470
minutes even though he appeared in
only nine of the eleven games con
tested by the Indians. Next in line
was Don Colvin, left end, who played
426 minutes, and third was George
Grey, left tackle, who played 407
minutes. Grey was the only man to
play in all eleven games.

WHILE "Tiny Tom" Cordry
has been running wild over Mid
west courts, basketball stock at
Stanford has been taking a big
rise with the news that Keith
Topping has eluded the faculty
axe. and will be ready and wait
ing for the team's return. If that
doesn't give the betting sharks
a pain in the neck we will he
vastly surprised.
SHED A TEAR FOR POOR OLD
S.C., the dear boys are losing a whole
THREE stars from this year's foot
ball outfit, and they have an excep
tionally good freshman team coming
up to the varsity next year.
