### 
Coach Nort Thornton's freshman I
mermen received a huge set-back
this week when Phil Bateson, their

the little big meet and was also the
| fastest man upon the water polo
j team.
Despite the loss of Bateson, Coach
Thornton is not pessimistic but in
tends to reconstruct his water polo
team if necessary in order to present
the strongest possible line-up when
the babes compete against the Ber-
I keley frosh late in March.

his guard position to a forward thus
: shifting Danforth to sprint in an
i attempt to remedy the situation. In

ing himself the best all - around

sult of his victory was the recipient
