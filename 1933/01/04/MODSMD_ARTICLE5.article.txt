### 
Because the next A.S.S.U. con

Pan - Hellenic council announces
that the second week of women's
rushing will be extended through
January 19, allowing no dinner date
on January 18, and pledging on Jan
uary 20. The first week of rushing
lasts from January 7 through Jan
uary 10; two days of silence are
then followed by the second week
from January 13 to 19.
In an endeavor to cut down ex
expenses, Pan-Hellenic has limited
the amounts which may be spent on
food and decorations by the various

uuudcaÂ» cll iii uif Jiuiiiuti ui luuiatra
that may be served at any one din

the rule that no house may ask a
rushee to break a date already made
