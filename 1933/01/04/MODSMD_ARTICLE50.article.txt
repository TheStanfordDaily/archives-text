# Hank Shaldach Spurns Pro Bid
## California Star Wants To Continue Law Study 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 4. —
Spurning an offer to play profession
al football, Hank Schaldach, stellar
backfield man in the East-West game
of last Monday and last season's
halfback for California, claimed that
he was going to forget all about
football and turn his attention to the
study of law.
Schaldach's move in declining a
bid to turn professional hushed
rumors and predictions of his be- |
coming the drawing card in the
Knights of Columbus game to be
played here January 22. After his
dynamic display of scoring power in
last Monday's game, Schaldach was
being considered as a feature man
in that game when the famous Green
Bay Packers, rated as the greatest
professional grid team ever pro
duced, meets a team to be picked by
Ernie Nevers.
"I guess I'll let last Monday's
game stand as my last,"' Schaldach
! said. "To play behind the wonderful
interference of Harry Stafford, Buck
Koy, and Max Krause was a great
feeling. Without their help, I never
could have been lucky enough to
; score those three touchdowns."
An admirer of his suggested that,
had he been playing for Southern
California in last Monday's form, he
would have been an all-American.
"That, I don't know," Hank replied.
"Incidentally, I nearly went to U.S.C.
before I finally decided to go to
California. It sure would have been
a great feeling to carry that football
behind the great blocking of Ernie
Pinckert and the other Trojan in
terference men."
