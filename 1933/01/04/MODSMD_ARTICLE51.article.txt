# BRADSHAW PLANS HEAVY WORKOUTS FOR FROSH CAGERS
## Yearling Quintet Shows Up As Strongest Cardinal Squad For Years 
### 
The head man of the freshman
basketball squad, Mister James
Bradshaw, yesterday afternoon gath
ered his even dozen of players
around him for the first time since
last December 17th and began
strenuous preparation for the forth
coming cage wars.
Bradshaw fully realizes that un
defeated seasons do not grow on
trees and so he will put his men 1
through some stiff workouts before
the S.F.U. contest Saturday eve
ning, which game will mark the lo- !
cal debut of a '33 Stanford basket
ball team, and the skipper of the
frosh is depending upon his charges
to make a favorable impression.
The Stanford yearling quintet
this year has the makings of one of
the best frosh teams to report on the
Farm in nearly a decade. The boys j
have the potential qualities of a
winning squad, although one must
not overlook Ritchie Hay and his j
Cub mates at California, who also
appear exceptionally strong.
Although the "regulars" have not
yet been picked, the combination of
George Vigue, at center, Ralph Man
nion and Alec Trompas, at the for
ward berths, and Addie Barnett and
Don Maentz, on the guard posts,
works together very smoothly and
bids fair to become Saturday night's
starting lineup. Before this happens,
however, such men as Wally Brooke,
| Harry Dutton, Jake Katz, Johnnie j
Reisner, and Mill Lahman, among
others, will have plenty of chance
to parade their ability before the
head man while the latter attempts
to single out his best-clicking com
| bination.
