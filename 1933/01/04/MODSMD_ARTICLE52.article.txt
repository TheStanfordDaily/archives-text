# Baseball Manager's Post Open To Sophomore Men
## 
### 
Aspirants for sophomore baseball
manager's position may sign up
after 4 o'clock any day this week
with Frank Lloyd, baseball manager,
at the B.A.C. Building.
The work as sophomore manager
takes the place of Lower Division
physical education requirements and
is the first step toward the man
ager's position.
Besides the experience obtained as
manager there is a chance for trav
eling with the Stanford squad on its
projected barnstorming tours. Lloyd
announces several trips are being
discussed tentatively, with a possi
bility of one to Japan.
