famed Arizona Wildcats, outstand-1
ing collegiate four in the country, i
\ etei an players, these Wildcats; one i
of th< ?m, Lou Brown, is unofficially 1
rated at four goals, a good fat rat- I
ing for even a professional.

Before sttrting on the trip, Cap
tain Dick Gordan, coach of the Red
shirts, sized up the two teams and
said that with a six-goal handicap
the Card riders would make it warm I
for (he Wildcats.

match be played at scratch. It was, |
