Winning one out of four matches
played in the Southwest during the,

themselves in spite of a record that j
on paper doesn't look too fancy.
For the one victory was over the I
famed Arizona Wildcats, outstand-1
ing collegiate four in the country, i
\ etei an players, these Wildcats; one i
of th< ?m, Lou Brown, is unofficially 1
rated at four goals, a good fat rat- I
ing for even a professional.

Before sttrting on the trip, Cap
tain Dick Gordan, coach of the Red
shirts, sized up the two teams and
said that with a six-goal handicap
the Card riders would make it warm I
for (he Wildcats.
But Arizona insisted that the first I
match be played at scratch. It was, |
and Stanford was humbled 11-4.1
This first game was a wild affair.
Played on a tiny practice field be
cause of bad weather, neither team
had a chance to show much real
polo.
Cards Lose to Army
Over at El Paso for a game De
cember 26, the Cards were taken by
the Fort Bliss Cavalry and the score
was 8-5. Stanford was denied a 4-

back Stanford's former bonus of
four goals and played the last game
at scratch. Score: 7-0, Arizona on

Before sttrting on the trip, Cap
tain Dick Gordan, coach of the Red
shirts, sized up the two teams and
said that with a six-goal handicap
the Card riders would make it warm I
for (he Wildcats.
But Arizona insisted that the first I
match be played at scratch. It was, |
and Stanford was humbled 11-4.1
This first game was a wild affair.
Played on a tiny practice field be
cause of bad weather, neither team
had a chance to show much real
polo.
Cards Lose to Army
Over at El Paso for a game De
cember 26, the Cards were taken by
the Fort Bliss Cavalry and the score
was 8-5. Stanford was denied a 4-
goal handicap which Captain Gordan
requested.
Back at Arizona again on Decem
ber 28 for the second match of the
series, the Wildcats compromised
and spotted the Cards four goals
instead of the six which had been
asked for. But four was plenty in
this game, for Stanford flashed
through with' a 5-3 victory. This
game saw Luppen, number one for
the Redshirts, in the best form he
has shown all season.
Wildcats Win Last Tilt
For the last match Arizona took
back Stanford's former bonus of
four goals and played the last game
at scratch. Score: 7-0, Arizona on
top. Outplayed in four of the six
chukkers, the Wildcats hung up 5
of their seven goals in the two
chukeers in which they clicked. Lou
Brown, number three for Arizona,
alone made six of the seven goals.
Johnny Myers, regular back for
the Redshirts, was laid up with the
flu while on the trip and was un
able to play in any of the matches.
Ken Baer took his place, and ac
cording to Captain Gordan, played
some hard polo.
A return series with Arizona will
be played here April 14-15.
