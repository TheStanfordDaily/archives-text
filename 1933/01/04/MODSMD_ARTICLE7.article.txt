# ENGLISH ACTOR TO SPEAK HERE
## Maurice Colbourne Will Discuss G. B. Shaw 
### 
Maurice Col bourne, English actor
director-author, is to speak under
the auspices of the English Club at
4:15 o'clock next Monday in the Lit
tle Theatre.
Colbourne's subject will be
"George Bernard Shaw—The Plus
and Minus Quantities in 'Too True
to Be Good'." The actor is an au
thority on Shaw, not only having
produced most of his plays either
in England or Canada, but being a
personal friend of "G. 8.5."
Here Before
Shaw's latest comedy has aroused
an unusual amount of comment
from the critics, even for a Shaw
play, and Colbourne will attempt to
evaluate this criticism and discover
the value and quality of the play.
Last here with his company three
years ago, Colbourne, with his co
producer and star, Barry Jones, has
just toured across Canada with the
London company of Robert Sher
wood's "The Queen's Husband."
Shaw to Come
The lecture should be doubly in
teresting in view of the fact that
Shaw himself appears to be break
ing his vow of disinterestedness in
the United States and is expected
to arrive in San Francisco on a tour
around the world about the 24th of
March.
The old lion of British letters still
arouses storms of applause and
wrath with his acid commentaries
and although the critics have been
trying to declare him dead for some
time he insists upon belying them
with some further proof of his
mental agility and vitality.
