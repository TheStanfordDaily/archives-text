# COUNCIL PUTS GIL CARR IN CHAIRMANSHIP
## Tom Campbell Succeeds To Secretary's Post; New Member Soon 
### 
Gil Carr, prominent senior mem
ber of the Men's Council, was elected
chairman of this organization yes
terday to fill the position left vacant
by the graduation of Gordy Camp
bell last quarter. The position of
secretary was given to Tom Camp
bell, who succeeds the new chair
man in this office.
A new member will be appointed
soon to restore the council to its
regular membership of five repre
sentatives. No information as to the
name of the new member was avail
able late last night.
Meetings with the freshmen to ex
plain the honor code will be re
sumed soon, according to Gil Carr.
The success of this movement has
been proven by the fact that no
member of last year's freshman class
or of the present fii*st-year group
has been called before the council
for honor violations.
A definite time for meetings has
not been arranged as yet but details
should be decided upon some time
this week.
