# LARGE CROWD SEEKS ROLES FOR 'HOLIDAY'
## Tryouts To Be Continued Tonight; Many Called For Barry Play 
### 
Greeted last night at the tryouts j
for Philip Barry's "Holiday" by a j
tremendous group of aspiring thes- j
pians, Director Harold Helvenston
was unable definitely to cast any of
the twelve parts in the forthcoming
production.
Surpassing even the record turn- |
out for last quarter's "Death Takes J
a Holiday," the crowd which gath- !
ered in the Assembly Hall last night
was so great that many of the con- j
tenders were unable to read, so that
further first tryouts will be con- j
ducted tonight from 7:15 to 9 o'clock. I
At the same time the following are i
asked to return: Marjorie Beuttner, !
Frances Burks, Elizabeth Chapin, j
Barbara Collins, Beulah Dimmitt, 1
Eleanor Furst, Marian Jones, Mary j
Anita Loos, Claii'e Mitchell, Jo
sephine Wilson, Virginia Wilson, and
Mary Elizabeth Wright; Stan Beau- j
baire, Jimmy Benet, Paul Crary, Joe j
Lawry, Bill Reppy, James Sandoe, !
Lawrence Wallace, and Will Wil- |
Hams. Those whose names are not |
included are asked to look at the i
bulletin board outside of Room 203,
in the event that others are called !
back.
With all the roles still open, there [
is a wealth of parts before the con- J
testants. Laid in a wealthy New York
home, "Holiday" contains some of j
the most delightful characters ever
to tread the modern stage. They are !
all "live people" with an intelligent, !
modern attitude toward matters, and j
the plot that revolves around them, j
though not new, is one of such charm j
as to make it appear unique.
