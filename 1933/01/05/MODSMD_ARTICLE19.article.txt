## 
### 
The 1933 Military Ball on Febru- ]
ary 17 will follow the tradition of
the brilliant balls held in the past
by Scabbard and Blade, honorary
military organization, according to
Paul Wendell, chairman of the com- I
mittee in charge. The effective mili
tary motif which has customarily j
been used will prevail again this j
year. Although plans have not been ;
definitely arranged to date, the com- !
mittee expects to announce further j
details by next week.
Last year the ball was not held |
when Scabbard and Blade was un- j
able to obtain an open date. The I
dance is an all-campus affair.
