"Injustice! . . . Ruin! . . . Down
with America!"
Such are the cries of French poli
ticians, editors, and particularly stu
dents. Hands-across-the-sea senti
ment has changed lately to fists
across the sea, according to letters
received from former Stanford stu
dents now residing in Paris.
"Young Patriot" movements have
found thousands of followers, and
French newspapers are filled with
diatribes against "miserly Uncle
Shylock."
Parisian journals received on the
campus this week screamed in black
headlines: "Not a penny for Amer- ;
ica! Make Germany Pay!" Organiza
tions of patriotic collegians of Paris
paraded the streets nightly while the
war debt discussions were taking
place, carrying signs, according to
the former Stanfordites, announcing

"Down with the debts," "Down with
America," "Not a sou to the rich
Americans."
After one of the nightly torchlight j
parades of the Paris Law School ,
students, protesting against debt j
payments, a French newspaper re
marked editorially, "This is the I
energetic expression of the will of j
the French youth, which will not i
let the great French nation be de- J
spoiled. The young patriots say that I
the workers will receive less pay 1
and be forced to give more taxes if
France helps the Americans."
Another paper remarked, "The
diplomtatic action of the United
States these last years has permitted
Germany to escape her obligations, j
find yet they force France to pay. ;
The government must hear the cries !
of youth, who will not accept the
injustice and ruin America is bring- 1
ing to France."
