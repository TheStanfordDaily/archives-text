## Livermore Warns Against Rule Breaking 
### 
Cards for the final period of rush
ing of the Class of 1936 will go on
sale in the A.S.S.U. offices at 9 \
o'clock this morning. Ike Livermore, j
president of the Interfraternity
Council, said last night that the j
fraternities should get their cards as i
early as possible in order to have !
their replies by Saturday night or :
Monday morning at the latest.
Rushing for the final period be- i
gins Monday, January 9, and con
tinues until Thursday night with
pledging on Friday, January 13. Two
dates will be permitted each of the j
four rushing days, those of luncheon j
and dinner, the only exception being !
Thursday night when the period will !
last until 10 o'clock at night to per
mit the fraternities to take their I
nuggets to a show in Paly if they '
wish.
Livermore also pointed out thai j
the illegal rushing rules are in effect i
until noon Monday and that the
penalties will be just as severe with j
off-campus rushing being especially
fxowned upon. Pertaining to this ;
matter is the resolution passed at
the last session of the Council to
the effect that no fraternity man j
shall enter Encina for any purpose !
during the final rushing period.
