# Hoover To Give Address At Educators' Meeting
## 
### 
Secretary Ray Lyman Wilbur has I
arranged for President Hoover to j
address the opening session today of j c
the group of educators meeting with ' 1
representatives of organized labor I 1
and agriculture for a two-day con- t
ference. They will attempt to evolve t
a plan whereby educational costs j t
may be reduced in keeping with i t
shrinking incomes at the least pos- |
sible harm to the rising generation. .
"The conference will be largely an ! '
effort to survey taxation in relation j
to school costs," Wilbur said. They
hope to agree on a pattern that will
fit any community.
