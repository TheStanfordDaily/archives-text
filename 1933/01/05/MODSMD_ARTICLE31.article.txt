# B.A.C. To Name New Grid Coach Tonight; Thornhill Favored
## Selection of Assistants To Be Withheld Until Future Date; New Coach Must Maintain Closer Contact With Grays and Freshmen 
### BOB LETTS 
Stanford's new football coach will be named tonight.
If Claude E. ("Tiny") Thornhill, present guide of the Cardinal line, is
named, Ernie Nevers, former Stanford all-American fullback and head of
the Grays last season, will be promoted to varsity hackfield coach.
The new mentor will be closely watched to see that he maintains a
closer acquaintanceship with members of the Gray and freshman teams.
Naming of assistant varsity men and members of the two subordinate

will be withheld until a future
dale, with the possible exception of
Nevers.
These four highlights were the
principal results of last night's ses
sion of the staff committee of Stan
ford's Board of Control which con
vened under the chairmanship of
Frank Guerena, '11, to boil down a
mass of material which has pre
sented itself since the unexpected
resignation of Glenn Scobey Warner
last month.
All discussions were confined to
the selection of the new head coach,
Guerena said after Ihe meeting, and
no definite conclusion was reached,
since four of the nine B.A.C. mem
bers were present at the meeting
and were able to draw some opinions
upon which to base their votes this
evening.
"Although the new freshman and
Gray staffs have caused us a lot of
w*>rry," Guerena said, "we are most
interested in getting the principal
position filled. We will not be able
to go into the other problems until
the next meeting of the board."
Thornhill and Maurice ("Clipper")
Smith, Santa Clara University
coach, continue to lead the popular
opinion, Guerena pointed out. So far
as could be determined, the B.A.C.
members are similarly inclined, with
the apparent emphasis being on
Thornhill, since some of them havff
expressed desires to continue the
Warner system at Stanford.
A fifth point which has gone large
ly unnoticed so far is the naming of
the third varsity mentor. Guerena
said that one would be chosen and
that he would be in charge of the
ends. He did not mention any names,
but it is understood that John Bunn,
Warner's chief scout last season,
member of the frosh staff, and head
basketball coach, was among the
possibilities. Another was Jim Law
son, captain and all-American end
here in 1924. Lawson at present is in
business with his brother in Palo
Alto.
More than 50 applications have
been received for either the head
position or for a staff post, Guerena
announced. He said that strong ef
forts would be made to pick men
who have played under the Warn«r
system at Stanford. Who of that
classification had applied would not
be mentioned.
Nevers has made it plain that he
will accept a post under Thornhill
only with the clear understanding
that he will not be a competitor for
the head coaching job.
The date of the next meeting of
the B.A.C. has not been definitely
set.

who have played under the Warn«r
system at Stanford. Who of that
classification had applied would not
be mentioned.
Nevers has made it plain that he
will accept a post under Thornhill
only with the clear understanding
that he will not be a competitor for
the head coaching job.
The date of the next meeting of
the B.A.C. has not been definitely
set.
Stanford's new football coach will be named tonight.
If Claude E. ("Tiny") Thornhill, present guide of the Cardinal line, is
named, Ernie Nevers, former Stanford all-American fullback and head of
the Grays last season, will be promoted to varsity hackfield coach.
The new mentor will be closely watched to see that he maintains a
closer acquaintanceship with members of the Gray and freshman teams.
Naming of assistant varsity men and members of the two subordinate

will be withheld until a future
dale, with the possible exception of
Nevers.
These four highlights were the
principal results of last night's ses
sion of the staff committee of Stan
ford's Board of Control which con
vened under the chairmanship of
Frank Guerena, '11, to boil down a
mass of material which has pre
sented itself since the unexpected
resignation of Glenn Scobey Warner
last month.
All discussions were confined to
the selection of the new head coach,
Guerena said after Ihe meeting, and
no definite conclusion was reached,
since four of the nine B.A.C. mem
bers were present at the meeting
and were able to draw some opinions
upon which to base their votes this
evening.
"Although the new freshman and
Gray staffs have caused us a lot of
w*>rry," Guerena said, "we are most
interested in getting the principal
position filled. We will not be able
to go into the other problems until
the next meeting of the board."
Thornhill and Maurice ("Clipper")
Smith, Santa Clara University
coach, continue to lead the popular
opinion, Guerena pointed out. So far
as could be determined, the B.A.C.
members are similarly inclined, with
the apparent emphasis being on
Thornhill, since some of them havff
expressed desires to continue the
Warner system at Stanford.
A fifth point which has gone large
ly unnoticed so far is the naming of
the third varsity mentor. Guerena
said that one would be chosen and
that he would be in charge of the
ends. He did not mention any names,
but it is understood that John Bunn,
Warner's chief scout last season,
member of the frosh staff, and head
basketball coach, was among the
possibilities. Another was Jim Law
son, captain and all-American end
here in 1924. Lawson at present is in
business with his brother in Palo
Alto.
More than 50 applications have
been received for either the head
position or for a staff post, Guerena
announced. He said that strong ef
forts would be made to pick men
who have played under the Warn«r
system at Stanford. Who of that
classification had applied would not
be mentioned.
Nevers has made it plain that he
