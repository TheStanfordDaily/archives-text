# BUY AMERICAN!
## 
### 
For every scheme, ridiculous or otherwise, (lint has
heen proposed in congress as a cure for the depression,
there have heen thousands expounded by ordinary citizens
in barber-shop conversation. Kvery man has his pel plan,
each a sure lire affair which congress is too dumb to try.
However fantastic a majority of these products of the
lav mind must inevitably be, they are encouraging as indi
cations that the proletariat is being spurred to thought,
even though it look a depression to do it. And the common
man's plans are harmless, since they haven't a chance of
gelling outside the barber shop door.
But when a publisher who moulds the opinions of mil
lions ol voters adopts a plan as asinine as any of these,
labels it a sure cure, and promotes it to the skies, the result
is far from harmless.
The "Buy American" brainchild of \V. TC Hearst can
have only one ultimate result, to retard economic recovery
not only of the I niled States, but of the entire world. The
freshman in economics knows that international trade is
necessary to economic health. If this country does not buy
foreign goods, foreigners will not buy its goods, and trade
will cease.
Hearst, too, wants the United States to collect every
dollar ol the foreign debt. It is common knowledge that
all the gold in the world would pay only a small fraction of
that debt, even if (he debtors had it to use. Thus the only
way France, Kngland, Ilalv, etc., can pay is by selling
tilings in the American market. Yet Hearst fells our gul
lible citizenry to "Buy American," exclusively.
A committee of twenty-six of the country's leading
economists recently recommended that, as one of the basic.
remedies for the depression, the tariffs of this and other
countries be lowered that international trade might be
stimulated. Ihe storv of this, a suggestion bv men who
have spent lifetimes in studying the economic pulse of the
world, appeared only once, in a single column of one day's
issue of the country's newspapers.
"W't Hearst's nonsensical scheme, just because it is his,
has blazed forth every day for a week, splashed sensation
ally over whole editorial pages of newspapers read by mil
lions throughout Hie land.
Is there no justice?
