# A 						QUEEN FOR THE DAILIES

### 
•I list ill I lie close ol last quarter, which was jusl in time
lo evade Ihe Daily's scathing editorial tongue, newspapers
up and down Ihe state developed an epidemic of front page
.co-ed cuts, depicting Stanford's fairest, the choice of the
Stanford roughs for beauty and brains and whatnot. Of
course the whole thing was just the annual hair-brained
gag ol certain campus press correspondents and was abso
lutely without fact or popular fancy to back il up, but how
was the high school senior in Tall or Mill Valley lo know
II s happened before, and it'll most likely happen again,
so long as there are Five Hundred, or potential Sunday
magazine editors, al large on Ihe Farm. This arbitrary se
lection, by two or three otherwise unoccupied news fcr
rctcrs, is not a particularly harmful practice, but it's pretty
discouraging.
Such pranks in Ihe press carry the false impression that
Stanford students actually do conduct some sort of beauty
queen election. Worse still, they imply that Stanford is
wonl lo judge her daughters on a "face, form, and fun"
basis.
Then there's the woman so "honored" to be sympathized
with also. The restless news correspondents might at least
have taken Ihe trouble lo dig up a picture which did her
justice.
