The Stanford Haskctball loam returns tomorrow from
ils barnstorming trip rendv for its eleven conference
panics. In winning three panics Iho Indians performed ac
cording to 11 io predictions of (loach John Hunn. The facts
must ho faced (hat the potential strength of the UKM var
sity is very low. To contrast with the famine on the Farm,
f'c other conference teams are heralded as stronger than
ever and well fed with material.
Every team coached by John Hunn has had two notable
characteristics: It never complains of ils lot, and it never
cries about what might have been. It has always done the
best possible with the material al hand, and shown deter
mined fight in every game played. It was this spirit that
enabled hist year's varsity to pull two seemingly hopeless
victories out of the old medicine bag.
Hating the team only by cold figures, conference vic
tories can be expected as often as miracles occur. How
ever, statistics leave out the human equation which is ex
actly the element that causes {lie unexpected upsets with
a bunch of scrappy players. A\iy team that won't give up
can be counted on to supply sonic surprises.
The Indian's ability to take is unquestioned. However,
i! shouldn't amaze it he showyd a decided aptitude for
dishing it out. \
