The Union is probably the greatest
collector of campus gripes. At least,
J know of no one else who would
attempt to vie for the honors. In sea
i son and out of season the flood of
criticism rages. The Union is to be
pitied—not because of the "beating'
it takes but because most of the
abuse is well-earned. But so red does
the campus see every time it thinks
"Union," that other objects equally
deserving of condemnation slink by
unnoticed—like weasels in the night.
(Assuming 'weasels slink in the
night.)
Let's down our Union coffee —thin
cream and all—and cross the street
to the Bookstore. This institution is
run on the benevolent theory that
the profits will be rebated to the
students. During hilarious prosper
ity, a few measly dollars were re
bated—but with the advent of de
pression, the rebate trickle grew
more and more meagi'e and has
finally petered out entirely.
But how can students complain—
for they always have the rosy prom
ise before them that any Bookstore
profit will be rebated to them! The
fact that there are no profits doesn't
mar the theory. It remains—a glib,
melliflous, and colorful excuse for
high prices and no rebates.
During Coolidge prosperity, every
one was making money. The Book
store couldn't miss. They couldn't
escape the terrific boom. But now,
despite a virtual monopoly and a

most lucrative field, they lost almost
two thousand dollars during the
year. One might imagine that this
,vas due to terrific cuts in business.
Poor little Bookstore! They were
only able to negotiate a miserable
$141,640 net sales—barely enough to
keep several merchants in business.
As far as net sales are concerned,
the Bookstore did fairly well —
everyone should agree. But to carry
these 141 thousand dollars across the
counter it required some 30 thou
sand dollars in salaries and BO
NUSES TO EMPLOYEES. In short,
the Bookstore spent over one dollar
in wages to make a sale of five dol
lars. Going in the red and throttling
a possible rebate to instant death
was inevitable.
To say that the Bookstore is mer
cilessly plundering the campus is
technically true but gives the wrong j
impression. We are not stating or
insinuating any kind of dishonesty j
whatsoever. We are stating that from i
a study of the facts, it seems that
the Bookstore is staggering along in
one horrible economic reel. They are
already up to their fattened ankles
in the red sea of ink; when they
should be skipping merrily along in
green pastures of plenty—plenty of
rebates.
There is nothing original or per
sonal in these figures. Therefore I
cannot guarantee their veracity.
They are simply the figures taken
from the yearly statement by the
Bookstore. —Abe Mellinkoff

There is nothing original or per
sonal in these figures. Therefore I
cannot guarantee their veracity.
They are simply the figures taken

The Union is probably the greatest
collector of campus gripes. At least,
J know of no one else who would
attempt to vie for the honors. In sea
i son and out of season the flood of
criticism rages. The Union is to be
pitied—not because of the "beating'
it takes but because most of the
abuse is well-earned. But so red does
the campus see every time it thinks
"Union," that other objects equally
deserving of condemnation slink by
unnoticed—like weasels in the night.
(Assuming 'weasels slink in the
night.)
Let's down our Union coffee —thin
cream and all—and cross the street
to the Bookstore. This institution is
run on the benevolent theory that
the profits will be rebated to the
students. During hilarious prosper
ity, a few measly dollars were re
bated—but with the advent of de
pression, the rebate trickle grew
more and more meagi'e and has
finally petered out entirely.
But how can students complain—
for they always have the rosy prom
ise before them that any Bookstore
profit will be rebated to them! The
fact that there are no profits doesn't
mar the theory. It remains—a glib,
melliflous, and colorful excuse for
high prices and no rebates.
During Coolidge prosperity, every
one was making money. The Book
store couldn't miss. They couldn't
escape the terrific boom. But now,
despite a virtual monopoly and a

most lucrative field, they lost almost
two thousand dollars during the
year. One might imagine that this
,vas due to terrific cuts in business.
Poor little Bookstore! They were
only able to negotiate a miserable
$141,640 net sales—barely enough to
keep several merchants in business.
As far as net sales are concerned,
the Bookstore did fairly well —
everyone should agree. But to carry
these 141 thousand dollars across the
counter it required some 30 thou
sand dollars in salaries and BO
NUSES TO EMPLOYEES. In short,
the Bookstore spent over one dollar
in wages to make a sale of five dol
lars. Going in the red and throttling
a possible rebate to instant death
was inevitable.
To say that the Bookstore is mer
cilessly plundering the campus is
technically true but gives the wrong j
impression. We are not stating or
insinuating any kind of dishonesty j
whatsoever. We are stating that from i
a study of the facts, it seems that
the Bookstore is staggering along in
one horrible economic reel. They are
already up to their fattened ankles
in the red sea of ink; when they
should be skipping merrily along in
green pastures of plenty—plenty of
rebates.
There is nothing original or per
sonal in these figures. Therefore I
cannot guarantee their veracity.
