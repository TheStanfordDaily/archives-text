ABIE'S IRISH ROSE—At the Al
cazar Theatre.
Henry Dully again brings favorites
from the pictures for first-hand ap
proval, this time in "Abie's Irish
Rose." George Sidney plays the Jew
ish father. He is very much at home
with the part and his naturalness
causes one to think twice before
realizing that Solomon Levi was
created by Anne Nichols. He is very
responsive to signs of approval on
the part of the audience, and each
bit of laughter and applause drives
him on to make more of the next
scene. Sidney alone warrants ap
proval of the production.
Charles Murray makes friends
with his facial antics. People expect
to laugh at Charlie, and people do—
even when he has nothing to do.
The conventional love interest, the
function of which is to precipitate
the dilemma, is carried by John
Darrow and Grace Cooper.
Pepi SinofT and Milton Wallace
(Mr. and Mrs. Cohen) contribute
excellent low comedy; their respec
tive operations and ham keep the
audience roaring. Competition for
the stars.
The Irish priest and the Jewish
rabbi are the steadying and moral
elements of the play—to them man
is more important than a wedding
ceremony performed under any
creed.
The play still holds its simple ap
peal for young and old; its charm
lies in its very human qualities.
Love, pathos, anger, comedy of situ
aiton, as well as of dialogue, unite
to form a picture close to the under
standing of everyone. Seldom is an
audience in so continued a state of
laughter. Those who have seen it
before laugh in anticipation and
those to whom the situation is new,
laugh in keen enjoyment.

(This revival of Anne Nichols'
play which is still trying to belie the
critical condemnation with which it
was first received closes Saturday.

! "Bridal Wise" is to open the next
day.)

MADCHEN IN UNIFORM. At the
Geary Theatre.
American critics and censors, ac
customed to Hollywood standards,
have read into this picture a sexual
interpretation which by no means
belongs there. And because of this
they pronounce the picture a mas
terpiece. It is not a masterpiece, but
fails only because of the limitations
imposed by the story.
The plot concerns a sensitive girl
in a strict boarding school. This
situation does not allow for any
real action; consequently the cli
maxes are artificial, and one can too
1 plainly see the director leading the
| characters from one situation to an
other. On top of this is piled an
; allegory about the passing of Prus
! sianism which is out of place and
necessitates considerable forcing. To
secure contrast and sympathy it was
necesssary to make the girl weakly
! sentimental or the boarding school
extremely strict. Fortunately the lat
ter course was chosen, but all is not
entirely convincing.
The acting is almost perfect, and
this results in fine characterizations
which are the chief value of the
picture. Bertha Thiele as the girl
Manuela should be especially com
mended for her naturalness in an
extremely difficult role. Dorothea
Wieck as Fraulein von Bernberg

showed fine control in a role that
might easily have been overplayed.
The naturalness of the whole cast,
including the extras, helped greatly
to cover the defects in the plot.
The scenes from Schiller's "Don Car
los" were especially outstanding.
The photography and recording
were mediocre, but these defects
went unnoticed.
