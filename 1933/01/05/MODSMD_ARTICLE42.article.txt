## 
### 
As the third group of a series of
artistic photographs being shown at
the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery this season, is a collection of
prints by Judith Martinez taken in
Mexico. The pictures will be shown
until January 15.
Miss Martinez has dealt principally
with architectural details and folk
scenes. Her groups and portraits are
done with a distinctive technique
that characterizes her work as brush
strokes characterize a painter.
In connection with her photo
graphs, Miss Martinez is also ex
hibiting a number of textile and
lacquer handicraft pieces from
Michoacan and Guerrero, Mexico.
The lacquer work is unusual in that
it is an art understood only by the
native Indians of Mexico.
An exhibit of more than HO dolls
from foreign lands is also being
shown. Assembled by Pedro Lemos,
Director of the Gallery, the collec
tion is of historical significance to
students of family life. Picturesque
dolls from India, Java, France, Italy,
Czechoslovakia, Holland, Germany,
Brittany, and Mexico are contained
in the collection. An outstanding
feature of the showing is a small
clay doll, once belonging to a Greek
girl, and recently excavated from
one of the ruins.
