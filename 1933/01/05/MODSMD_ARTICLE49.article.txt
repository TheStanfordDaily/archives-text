# Probation Awaits Rhodes Scholar After Holidays
## 
### 
J. Burke Knapp, winner of the
Cecil Rhodes scholarship to Oxford
University from the Northwest,
found himself on probation at Stan
ford University yesterday when he
arrived on the campus for registra
tion. The paradoxical situation was
ironed out however when it was dis
covered the scholastic penalty was
inflicted because of a slight error in
the registrar's office.
Knapp was granted a leave of ab
sence from the Stanford campus
when he went to Portland December
10 to take the Rhodes scholarship
examination. He was granted plus
incompletes in all his courses but
one in which he was given a straight

incomplete through a slight error of
an Economics professor. This incom
plete automatically placed the Stan
ford Rhodes scholar on probation.
To complicate matters Knapp dis
covered he could not draw the tui
tion money which he rebeives from
the Leon Sloss scholarship because
of the probation inflicted.
To further complicate the situa
tion it was discovered the professor
who turned in the straight incom
plete v/as out of town.
Knapp explained his plight to
Francis Haley, associate professor of
economics, who took it upon himself
to remove the incomplete, and
Knapp was allowed to register.
