MY. MY, THE OLD SYSTEM
even prevails in basketball —
U.S.F. has been bit by injuries
on tbe eve of a titanic tussle
with Stanford's travel-worn In
dians. Perhaps the little Indians
will have a chance to score some
points now. Wouldn't it be awful
if some team went into some
contest without any pre-gamc
injuries, or if these same pre
gamc injuries should turn out to
be real injuries and actually
keep the stars out of the battle?

THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE
can tell what the East thinks of the
Dickinson football rating system
now, but there is one thing sure, and
I hat is that the West will not look
on it as a very sure judge of the
national champion when the next
season rolls around. It the eminent
professor chooses to ignore post
season games, that is all right with
us. After all it is his own system.
But when he awards the national
championship to Michigan, before
U.S.C. has played Notre Dame, that
is another story. Both U.S.C. and
Notre Dame had outstanding teams
this year, and their game is a regu
lar part of their schedules. There
seems little logical excuse for say
ing that S.C. was not considered be
cause the average ability of Coast
teams in intersectional games was
low this year. II is too bad that all
this had to happen, when people
were really beginning to consider
his system as the one real judge of
the national champion.
VARIOUS PEOPLE HITHER AND
YON seem greatly worried over the
fact that Hank Schaldach won't be
put on anybody's Ail-American this
year, and some have even asked if
something couldn't be done about it.
From what we have seen of Hank
Schaldach in the past three years,
we should hazard the guess that
Hank will be perfectly satisfied to
take his peace of mind from the last
game of his career and the ovation
that he received. Hank has been
praying for perfect shape for "just
one game," and a team to back him
up. He got both, and now he can
study law in perfect contentment.
And, for heaven's sake, let's lay off
these sobbing obituaries that have
been clogging the presses of late!
AND DID YOU KNOW that Oski
Slade, now with Brooklyn and for
mer Mission shortstop, is working
out on the Stanford track oval to get
in shape for next season? It seems
that he attributes his base-stealing
ability to similar training periods
here in the past. —Bob Wade

seems little logical excuse for say
ing that S.C. was not considered be
cause the average ability of Coast
teams in intersectional games was
low this year. II is too bad that all
this had to happen, when people
were really beginning to consider
his system as the one real judge of
the national champion.
VARIOUS PEOPLE HITHER AND
YON seem greatly worried over the
fact that Hank Schaldach won't be
put on anybody's Ail-American this
year, and some have even asked if
something couldn't be done about it.
From what we have seen of Hank
Schaldach in the past three years,
we should hazard the guess that
Hank will be perfectly satisfied to
take his peace of mind from the last
game of his career and the ovation
that he received. Hank has been
praying for perfect shape for "just
one game," and a team to back him
up. He got both, and now he can
study law in perfect contentment.
And, for heaven's sake, let's lay off
these sobbing obituaries that have
been clogging the presses of late!
AND DID YOU KNOW that Oski
Slade, now with Brooklyn and for
mer Mission shortstop, is working
out on the Stanford track oval to get
in shape for next season? It seems
that he attributes his base-stealing
ability to similar training periods
here in the past. —Bob Wade
MY. MY, THE OLD SYSTEM
even prevails in basketball —
U.S.F. has been bit by injuries
on tbe eve of a titanic tussle
with Stanford's travel-worn In
dians. Perhaps the little Indians
will have a chance to score some
points now. Wouldn't it be awful
if some team went into some
contest without any pre-gamc
injuries, or if these same pre
gamc injuries should turn out to
be real injuries and actually
keep the stars out of the battle?

THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE
can tell what the East thinks of the
Dickinson football rating system
now, but there is one thing sure, and
I hat is that the West will not look
on it as a very sure judge of the
national champion when the next
season rolls around. It the eminent
professor chooses to ignore post
season games, that is all right with
us. After all it is his own system.
But when he awards the national
championship to Michigan, before
U.S.C. has played Notre Dame, that
is another story. Both U.S.C. and
Notre Dame had outstanding teams
this year, and their game is a regu
lar part of their schedules. There
seems little logical excuse for say
ing that S.C. was not considered be
cause the average ability of Coast
teams in intersectional games was
low this year. II is too bad that all
this had to happen, when people
were really beginning to consider
his system as the one real judge of
