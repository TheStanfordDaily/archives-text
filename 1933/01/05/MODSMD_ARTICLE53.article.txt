# Indian Basketball Team Will Return Tomorrow
## TOPPING COUNTED ON TO AID CARD'S SCORING CAPACITY Star Gives Needed Height To Hoop Squad, Raises Conference Rating 
### BOB LETTS 
What to do with Keith Topping?
Now that the big basketballer has
straightened out his eligibility prob
lem that became so mixed up last
quarter, this problem awaits Coach
John Bunn when he returns here
tomorrow night with members of his
Stanford barnstorming team to pre
pare for conference conflicts.
Topping, a well-built 175-pounder
who recently won the University
novice light-heavyweight boxing
championship in two short battles,
will probably fit in at forward, Stan
ford displaying a noticeable lack of
scoring power on the Midwestern
trip. The shortness of Tommy Cor
dry, the sharp-shooting little for
ward, the only average height of Hal
Edelen, the center-apparent, and the
similar abbreviated stature of most
of the front-line candidates will
necessitate Topping at a position
where his tallness can be best used
to correct Stanford's greatest weak
ness—scoring ability.
Height Great Advantage
His 6-foot 1-inch frame will be
valuable in rebound work, an item
that has been left so far almost en
tirely to Edelen. The announcement
concerning Topping's eligibility
means, at the moment that Charlie
Glasgow and Payne Palmer will
both be held in reserve forward
positions. Both are good, but lack
the stature that is rapidly, becoming
so essential in Pacific Coast basket
ball circles.
U.C.L.A. and California have long
been leading advocates of tall play
ers. Club teams in the bay district
are after (he big fellows, and it is
becoming a physical necessity to be
tall to. get shots off the backboard
on offense.
Cordry will still be used where he
Has been in the past —in the district
betweeu approximately 12 and 20
feet from the hoop. Edelen and Top- j
ping will be used closer in, and big
John Hancock and Jay Tod will be ,
backing up the men at the guard J
positions. Hancock, who is quick for
a large man, has been hitting the

mark consistently on the barnstorm
ing trip, and one evening led Stan
ford's scorers with eight points—on
four long field goals.
