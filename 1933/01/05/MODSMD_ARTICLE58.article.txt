# TENTATIVE PLANS READY FOR BOXING TOURNEY ON FEB. 2
## Some Matches Scheduled With Old And New Talent Eager 
### 
With tentative plans calling for
the holding of the all-University
boxing tournament the evening of
Thursday, February 2, Stanford's
varsity mittmen will fight a full
series of matches this quarter. The
team bouts, many of which have al
ready been unofficially scheduled,
will be held after the all-University
tournament.

All members of the varsity
team are asked lo meet Coaches
liarry Maloney and Myron Schall
tomorrow afternoon at 5 o'clock
in the boxing room. The new in
tercollegiate boxing rules, plans
for training, and the varsity
schedule will he discussed.

Prospects for the strongest team in
Stanford history were considerably
dimmed when it was learned that
Phil Smith, Pacific Coast intercolle
giate heavyweight champion, would
not return to Stanford this year.
With Smith out, the burden of fur
nishing the Cards with a good
heavyweight rests upon the broad
shoulders of Phil Johnston, who is
the novice heavyweight champion,
and Ben Palamountain, who has yet
to make his appearance around box
ing headquarters.
Keith Topping, novice light
heavyweight champion, should be
among the best on the Coast if he ,
finds that boxing does not interfere i
with basketball, or vice versa. Jack j
Perego and John Fowler, the latter I
also a novice champion, are good j
j middleweights, and Bob Quinn and |

Waldo Mundy give Stanford two of
the best welterweights in college
circles.
Fred Glover needs no introduction
as a lightweight, nor does Jim Feeley
as a featherweight. Veteran Yuji
Imai and novice champion Bunny
Johnson are a speedy and smart lit
tle pair of bantamweights.
Swindlers pay mailing list houses
; five times as much for names of
: people already uped as for new pros
-1 pects.
