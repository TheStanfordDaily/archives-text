# CUBBISON BANS WOMEN'S RIDING
## Edict Comes As Result Of Near Accidents 
### 
No longer will the booted and
spurred military man be seen lead
ing an extra horse up the Row or j
to Roble to take his girl for an |
afternoon ride at the army's expense J
for by an edict of Colonel Donald |
Cubbison, commanding the Stanford I
unit of the R.0.T.C., the privilege j
was abolished toward the end of j
last quarter.
Realizing that it has been a privi- |
lege of long standing, the Colonel .
does not want it thought that he |
stopped the practice without reason, j
Twice last quarter it was reported !
to him by reputable eye-witnesses !
that girls had been thrown, one nar- j
rowly escaping serious injury when j
her horse turned sharply at a canter ,
and threw her on Page Mill Road. |
Another escaped possible injury only !
by the intervention of one of the |
enlisted men when she attempted :
to get on the wrong side of a horse, j
In view of these occurences the j
Colonel felt that it was only a mat- |
ter of time until someone was seri
ously hurt and he acted before it i
was too late. In his own words it j
was too much like "giving a small |
boy a gun" to give horses to in- |
experienced riders since even the |
gentlest of horses become restive ;
when handled by a rider who has !
seldom if ever been on a horse be- j
fore.
