# Library Exhibit Observes Louisa Alcott Centennial
## 
### 
Commemorating the centennial
anniversary of the birth of Louisa
May Alcott, author of "Little
Women," "Little Men," and many
other books for adolescents, the Li
brary is exhibiting some of the first
editions of her works. The books are
from the Felton collection.
Miss Margaret Lothrop, who was
formerly an instructor in economics
at Stanford, recently returned from
Concord, the home of the author,
bringing some modern books on the
author and her works and pictures
of Wayside, one of the homes of
Miss Alcott. Miss Lothrop has just
purchased Wayside, the house in
which most of the famous books
were written.
