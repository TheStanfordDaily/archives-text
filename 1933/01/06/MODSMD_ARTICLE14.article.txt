# Experienced Actors Cast For 'Holiday'
## 
### 
Harold Helvenston's production of
"Holiday" got off to a promising
start last night, with the casting of
seven parts and the narrowing down
to two candidates for the remaining
roles.
Mary Anita Loos, late of the
"Death Takes a Holiday" cast, is
slated for the prominent role of Julia
Seton, sister of Linda, the heroine.
Julia is the beautiful and proud
debutante whose reverence for
riches fails to coincide with the
hero's dream of a holiday for him
self. Miss Loos, in addition to her
Alda in the Case! la play, has been
seen as Martha in the last Junior
Opera, and in the recent Big Game
Gaieties.
Edward Seton, wealthy and pomp
ous father of Linda and Julia, has
been assigned to Joseph Wolf, prom
inent actor-debater-author. Wolf is
best remembered for his splendid
work as Duke Lambert in "Death
Takes a Holiday," and he has also
appeared in "Wings Over Europe"
and "Romeo and Juliet," in addition
to authoring one of the best skits
in the last Gaieties.

The juiciest comedy part of the
entire play, Nick Potter, the charm
ing dilettante who admits that he
is "the world's great social menace
because he never got out and
worked," was awarded to Bob
Churchill, chairman of the Rally
Committee and write rof Gaieties
skits. Potter's story of his success
is the highlight of the second act.
Carter Meyer will appear as the
disgustingly snobbish cousin of the
Seton sisters, Seton Cram. Meyer
last appeared in the one-act play,
"The Grass Grows Red."
Eleanor Furst, long prominent in
dramatics, is to appear as the wife
of Seton Cram, Laura, who is even
more snobbish, more distinguished,
and more disagreeable than her hus
band.
Will Williams, prominent in sum
mer quarter plays, will be seen as
Henry, the butler.
The remaining parts will be cast
after tonight's rehearsal, which will
begin promptly at seven o'clock, and
the others scheduled to appear are
Jimmy Benet, Bill Mahu, Jim San
doe, John Peckham, Marian Jones,
and Elizabeth Chapin.
