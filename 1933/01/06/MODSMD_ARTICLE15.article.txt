# Amateurs Bring Trouble To Maurice Colbourne
## 
### James Sandoe 
"I admire and cncourage the Little
Theatre movement," said Maurice
Colbourne, English actor who is to
speak here on Monday, "but I
had some peculiar experiences with
it." We were standing in the royal
palace, sitting next to the desk of
"The Queen's Husband" after a per
formance of Robert Sherwood's
comedy.
"When we reached this country
we discovered," said Colbourne,
"that, in many places 'The Queen's
Husband' was being played by ama
teurs. One small group, discovering
that our touring company was ar
riving in a Canadian city on the
same evening that they were to pro
duce the play, wired us pleading
that we change our bill.
"I would have been quite willing
to change the bill for $10,000, what
it would have cost me to bring new
scenery and a new cast from Eng
land, but for some reason they didn't
find that satisfactory."'
The company playing the comedy I
is thi' original London cast and the

production is the same used there.
Colbourne and Jones produced the
play as a stop-gap in London when
110 Shaw play was available. And in
stead of running a few days it con
tinued for seven months.
Robert Sherwood, author of that
play and the last season success,
"Reunion in Vienna," traveled to
Toronto to see their production and
discovered that they had found in
the play what he had not suspected
was in it—sympathy. Instead of
playing it as a raucous burlesque as
it had been in New York, Colbourne
had changed the emphasis and Sher
wood was surprised and pleased.
Both Colbourne and Jones are en
thusiastically preparing Shaw's "Too
True To Be Good" for San Francisco
production. They have played it in
Canada but this is their first produc
tion of it for two months. They have
purchased Jonel Jorgulesco's settings
from the Theatre Guild and thus will
be playing the philosophic farce in
the background created for Ihe first
production.
