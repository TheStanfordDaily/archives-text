# BUTLER REPORT FAILS TO BARE GRID SCANDALS
## Probe Of Coast Conference Athletes Reveals No Illegal Practices 
### 
Expected to produce a sensation
in sports circles on the Coast, the
report of Jonathan A. Butler, the
j man who has worked in a shroud of
mystery for more than a year in
vestigating alleged athletic impuri
ties within the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, was released last night in the
form of a 48-page booklet which
made no charges of irregularities,
denied none, but confined itself to
a detailed discussion of entrance re
quirements of the various member
colleges, of academic regulations, or
financial status of athletes, of high
school ahtlete recruiting, and of eli
gibility of athletes.
If followers of sport on the Pacific
Coast expected a bombshell that
would reveal the Conference shirt
fi'ont as far from clean and would
verify some of their pet suspicions
of professionalism in the ranks, pub
lication of Butler's findings will
prove a decided disappointment.
Report "Whitewash"
His report, released through Pro
fessor H. C. Willett of Southern
! i California, appears to be more of a
; whitewash of the Conference col
-1 leges than an indictment of any of
them.
Butler claims he found no viola
tions of the conference rules. Al
though he investigated thousands of
individual cases, he reports that no
( athletes on the Pacific Coast are
holding jobs for which remunera
tion is out of proportion to the work
actually done.
Aid Exaggerated
He declares he found no instance
in which an athlete had been ad
mitted to a member college without
fulfilling the entrance requirements
of that college. In the matter of
financial aid tendered athletes, he
reports that rumors have greatly
exaggerated the fact, athletic schol
arships and alumni aid being the
only direct methods through which
athletes are assisted.
In spite of these specific denials of
rumors, many of which the foot
ball public had come to accept as
fact, the report does point out sev
eral cases in which observance of
the spirit of Conference rules and
of amateurism has been question
able. The m(Â»re serious of these have
been in the wholesale granting of
athletic scholarships, and in prac
tices of recruiting high-school play
ers.
Card Athletes Not Favored
Regarding the four member col
leges in the State of California, fol
lowing are the specific revelations
of chief interest:
STANFORD: Athletes are not fa
vored in granting of tuition notes or
of part-time loans. Eleven athletes
held scholarships during 1931-32.
Athletes holding part-time jobs were
found to be performing bona fide
service. Butler neither heard nor
received as much as one report al
leging that any of the Stanford
coaches had violated the Conference
rules relative to the soliciting of
athletes.
U.S.C.: Practically all of the ath
letes who represented U.S.C. in in
tercollegiate athletics during 1931-32
were granted scholarships. These are
described as Alumni District Schol
arships, granted on "scholarship,
leadership, and character," and rep
resent waiving of tuition charges by
the university. Jobs held by athletes
on the campus and in the production
of football moving pictures in Holly
wood proved to be remunerative in
proportion to service rendered. No
instances were found in which any
of the coaches of U.S.C. had violated :
the conference rules relative to the
soliciting of athletes. Fraternities are
very active in the matter of soliciting
athletes.
California Violations
CALIFORNIA: Athletes are treat
ed on exactly the same basis as non
sthletes in the matter of scholarship
awards,- with the exception of the j
two who are holders of the Andrew
Smith awards. Athletes are not a
favored group in receiving assistance
from student loan funds. All part
time jobs are legitimate. As to re
cruiting of high-school athletes,
1931-32 found the head football
coach and members of his staff trav
eling extensively within the state,
conversing with athletes relative to
their enrollment at California. Con
ference rules were in spirit,
though whether or not they were in
letter is debatable.
U.C.L.A. Recruits Frosh
U.C.L.A.: There are definite indi
cations that Oneonta Military Aca
demy, before it lost standing as an
! accredited preparatory school, and
Urban Academy since that time, have
taken high-school athletes who were
backed by zealous U.C.L.A. alumni
and graduated them with sufficient
recommendations for matriculation
at U.C.L.A. In public high Schools,
the scholarship of these athletes was
below standard. The head football
coach has not violated the rules on
recruiting, though there is evidence
that the freshman coach has. Ath
letes are not favored in receiving
i scholarships, loans, or employment.
At the end of the report, B\itler
lists 24 suggestions and recommend
ations to the conference, the most
important of which is the following:
Suggestions Listed
"That the Conference consider the
desirability of determining whether
the following practices are legitimate
1 or proper:
"1. For a college directly or in
directly to extend to a prospective
student, who is an athlete, a job
which may become a factor in de
termining the college in which he
will enroll.
"2. For a college to extend to ath
letes, tuition scholarships or cash
: scholarships in greater proportion
than it extends to non-athletes.
"3. If an athlete takes the initia
tive in seeking inducements because
of his athletic worth or otherwise,
should this factor influence the
amount of assistance that a college
may legitimately extend to him?
"4. For a coach or athletic official
to conduct solicitous correspondence 1
with a prospective athlete.
"5. For a coach'or athletic official
to urge alumni, high-school coaches,
or others to direct athletes to a uni
versity.
"6. For a university athletic offi
cial or coach to recruit athletes for
enrollment in a secondary school or
in a junior college.
"7. For a university to maintain a '
special employment bureau for ath
letes.
"8. For a university to provide
i special tutoring service for athletes."
