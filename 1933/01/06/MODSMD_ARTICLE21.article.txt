Willi the passing of Calvin C.oolidge, the I'nihed States
lias lost ils most astute politician. From 1!WM) lo H)2t) C.oo
lidge engaged in active politics holding many and varied
types of offices. The culmination of his political life was
the term spent as chief executive of his country. To trace
his rise is to chart the course of a well-run ship through
reef-in tested seas.
Not so brilliant or so spectacular as some of our presi
dents, Calvin Coolidge, nevertheless, was a model of honest
industry. The breath of scandal or corruption never
touched him personally or the administrations for which
lie was responsible.
An opportunist President Coolidge certainly was, but,
despite the powerful influences of the boom days, this
close-mouthed Yankee kept his feel firmly implanted on
the ground. When "he did not choose to run," he meant
exactly what he said. His decision was based on an honest
belief that no man should be in ollice for more than eight
years.
Will Rogers jocularly remarked that "We wanted some
body who would do nothing, and C.oolidge did it!" How
ever, this restraint is a characteristic which requires a
great deal of courage. Had President C.oolidge plunged us
into an orgy of spending the I nited States might be one of
the worst sufferers from the depression, instead of being
one of the minor sufferers.
C.oolidge represented belter than anyone the figure of
the taciturn, dry-humored, common-sensed Uncle Sam.
This latter gentlemen might well have said lo Calvin
Coolidge, " you are a man mv son."
