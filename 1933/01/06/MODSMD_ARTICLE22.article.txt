						BOMBSHELL THAT DIDN'T BURST

After Iwo seasons spent in thorough investigation of
; 11111 <' Ii (• conditions in (lie Pacific Coast Conference, Jona-
I !ian A. Rutin- litis made public liis findings to the ollieers
of thai body. Although an anticipated bombardment of the
athletic practices employed by the colleges and universi
ties in the (Conference did not develop, it must certainly
be admitted that Butler completed bis task, and did it well.
Disappointing to the critics of Conference regulations
and their supposed violations as the Butler report may
have been, its author fulfilled every assignment pointed
out to him by his employers. Butler did not make charges
of rule violations, he investigated them. Now he has em
bodied his findings in a comprehensive and fact-facing re
port. Butler has finished his task. He has set forth the
faults and virtues of the Conference, as he sees them, and
if the Conference thinks something should be done about
the situation, then it is up to the Conference to do some
thing.
