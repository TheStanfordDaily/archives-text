# MINDS IN THE MAKING

And again, Hall versus Row, or, if Row, which house
that is the question facing new women. For sororities in
terested in pledging neophytes to uphold the house repu
tation for dating at the Mark, making I'hi Beta Kappa, and
being prominent on the campus, and for Roble women who
are looking critically at Row silverware, the problem is
essentially the same. Some judgments, on both sides of
the fence, will be made in the haphazard, snap manner,
some under the emotional stress of gushing rushing, some
with sanity and lucid calculation, but the question must
soon be answered in all cases.
Although rightly considered an important decision, it
is far from being vital. Obviously evident is tin 4 fact that
the individual, not the pin nor the lack of the pin, is what
counts. In any case the decision is a personal one and not
to be influenced by malicious remarks of Roble women or
by campus men, who may be in no position to judge. The
sincerity and interests of those offering advice as well as
the validity of statements made might well be questioned
during rushing.
I'anhellenie regulations limiting the amount of money
to be spent by sororities for rushing purposes indicate the
dawn of a new and more enlightened consideration of the
real issues involved in rushing and pledging. Foolish
squandering of money to produce an ostentatious display
of flowers and the most elaborate of dinners is not in good
taste.
After January 20, when all the tears have been dried
away and all the smears of lip-rouge removed, and the
entire folderol of rushing is over, many a Roble woman
will find herself part and parcel of a sorority, still wonder
ing why she was so excited about it all. If she has con
sidered the general atmosphere of the living group, and has
been able to penetrate the cellophane-like surface of the
sorority picture, and has discovered at last the group with
congenial interests, then she will have found the most
roval of the Creeks.
