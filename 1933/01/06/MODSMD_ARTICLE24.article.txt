Everything gains by comparison—
except the Bookstore. Thus proving
that the Bookstore is an institution
unique and difTerent. In fact its pe
culiarities know no bounds, limits,
or boundaries. It is handed a rich
business—low rent—and a strangle
hold on the trade and still is unable
to pay decent rebates to the students.
It is not an unfair assumption to
state that the Bookstore probably
knows that there is a depression
going on. It is not expecting too
much to say that the Bookstore
should realize that in a depression,
expenses must be cut. Yet, these ele
mentary facts do not seem to have
been appreciated by the venerable
Book Trust.
Ripley in all his wanderings surely
missed a gold mine of material when
he missed the yearly Bookstore
statements. In 1927, the Monopoly's
net sales exceeded this year's. Yet in
that year of high salaries and in
cipient prosperity, the Bookstore
paid out some $8,000 less in salaries
than they did this year. One would
expect salaries to be slashed, or at
least trimmed, in this period of stress
and panic. That would be the nor
mal assumption—but not so with the j
Bookstore.
They defy economics. They chal
lenge logic. The Bookstore bids fair
to be the business enigma of the
age. Even in 1929—year of many'
peaks—they were able to do a larger

business than this year with about
$3,000 less outlay for keeping elderly
matrons behind their counters. The
normal thing is for wages to fall
with business. But the Bookstore
does the opposite. Alice in Book
storeland would get a real shock!
The Bookstore isn't normal. In
times of sub-normal business, they
pay abnormal salaries to an excess
number of employees. In times of
lowered income, they have increased
payrolls. The whole thing is topsy
turvy. Only a seasick Hill-Billy who
had been standing on his head for
G years could justify these cart-be
iore-the-horse economics.
At a time when students are hard
pressed the iron-fisted Monopoly has
stood behind its comfortable walls
and shot the same high prices at the
defenseless students. They have
triumphed. Let them rejoice at being
able to squeeze the campus. They
can sit on their stools, and laugh at
the campus with haughty disdain.
They are the victors. They have
beaten the campus.
To the victor belong the spoils.
Jackson may have started it—but
the Bookstore added the 1932 frills.
The Campus pays and the Monopoly
gains. Poor students—so much meat
for the devouring, insatiable, irre
sistible Bookstore (a non-profit or
ganization on the south side of La
' suen on the Stanford Campus).

cipient prosperity, the Bookstore
paid out some $8,000 less in salaries
than they did this year. One would
expect salaries to be slashed, or at
least trimmed, in this period of stress
and panic. That would be the nor
mal assumption—but not so with the j
Bookstore.
They defy economics. They chal
lenge logic. The Bookstore bids fair
to be the business enigma of the
age. Even in 1929—year of many'
peaks—they were able to do a larger

business than this year with about
$3,000 less outlay for keeping elderly
matrons behind their counters. The
normal thing is for wages to fall
with business. But the Bookstore
does the opposite. Alice in Book
storeland would get a real shock!
The Bookstore isn't normal. In
times of sub-normal business, they
pay abnormal salaries to an excess
number of employees. In times of
lowered income, they have increased
payrolls. The whole thing is topsy
turvy. Only a seasick Hill-Billy who
had been standing on his head for
G years could justify these cart-be
iore-the-horse economics.
At a time when students are hard
pressed the iron-fisted Monopoly has
stood behind its comfortable walls
and shot the same high prices at the
defenseless students. They have
triumphed. Let them rejoice at being
able to squeeze the campus. They
can sit on their stools, and laugh at
the campus with haughty disdain.
They are the victors. They have
beaten the campus.
To the victor belong the spoils.
Jackson may have started it—but
the Bookstore added the 1932 frills.
The Campus pays and the Monopoly
gains. Poor students—so much meat
for the devouring, insatiable, irre
sistible Bookstore (a non-profit or
ganization on the south side of La
' suen on the Stanford Campus).
—Abe Mellinkoff
Everything gains by comparison—
except the Bookstore. Thus proving
that the Bookstore is an institution
unique and difTerent. In fact its pe
culiarities know no bounds, limits,
or boundaries. It is handed a rich
business—low rent—and a strangle
hold on the trade and still is unable
to pay decent rebates to the students.
It is not an unfair assumption to
state that the Bookstore probably
knows that there is a depression
going on. It is not expecting too
much to say that the Bookstore
should realize that in a depression,
expenses must be cut. Yet, these ele
mentary facts do not seem to have
been appreciated by the venerable
Book Trust.
Ripley in all his wanderings surely
missed a gold mine of material when
he missed the yearly Bookstore
statements. In 1927, the Monopoly's
net sales exceeded this year's. Yet in
that year of high salaries and in
cipient prosperity, the Bookstore
paid out some $8,000 less in salaries
than they did this year. One would
expect salaries to be slashed, or at
