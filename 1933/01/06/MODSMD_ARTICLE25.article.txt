## RECENT PICTURES AT THE FILMARTE THEATRE. 
### 
The bills at the Filmarte have been
predominantly German, "A Nous La
Liberte" being the first French pic
ture shown in several months. Of
the German pictures the film oper
etta seems the most popular and dis
tinctive type. The two presented re
cently, "Gitta Entdeckt ihr Herb" and
"Ihre Hoheit Befield," were both
above average, avoiding the ten
dency to stylize the type. But many
pictures of the same type become
monotonous unless considerable va
riety is introduced; consequently the
German operetta may soon com
pletely lose popularity. "Gitta," al
though inferior to the kept piece and
standard of the type, "Zwei Hertzen
in drei-viertl Takt," was excellent,
chiefly because of an excellent score
well sung by Gitta Alpar and Ihe
usual fine acting by Gustav Froelich.
The other, more conventional, suc
ceeded through excellent comedy by
Kathe von Nagy and Willy Fritsch.
There were also two revivals of ear
lier favorites, "Die Lindinwirtin vom
Rhein" and "Die Forsterchristl," of
which the first was mediocre, and
the second charming even though
badly typed.
In the more serious class "Louise,
Queen of Prussia" was a historical
film supposed to inspire patriotism,
but its lack of well-constructed plot
prevented its being more than an
excellent acting vehicle for Henny
Porten and a very able cast. "The

Last Company" succeeded because
of Conrad Veidt's complete domina
tion of the picture. It was merely
"Doomed Battalion" in a less impos
ing scene with more horror, and a
climax in which every member of
the cast was killed. The attempt to
introduce feminine charm hindered
the action considerably.
The French film, "A Nous La Lib
erie," directed by Rene Clair, came
highly advertised and praised almost
universally by critics, who saw in it
farce with an underlying picture of
civilization and some very complex
meanings. The plot was as bad as
farce demands, without the virtue of
being comic; the acting was very
bad; the musical score was bad. The
effect produced was the same as that
of one of our own two-reel come
dies, and any subtle interpretation
in the picture could just as easily
have been read into one of these.
Rene Clair's directing tricks were
clever but not enough in evidence.
