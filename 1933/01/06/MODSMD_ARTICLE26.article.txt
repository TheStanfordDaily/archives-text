# BLOCKADE AMAZON
## 
### 
RIO JANEIRO, Brazil, Jan. 5 (/P)
â€”The Brazilian government, it was
learned today, has decided to re
nounce the treaty of 1851 respecting
free navigation on the Amazon, and
will establish a blockade on the
river. *
An ounce of radium carried in a
man's pocket would kill him in ten
hours.
