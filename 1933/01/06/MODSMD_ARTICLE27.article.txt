RATS!
'NEW YORK—In a $45 robbery
today one robber tripped on bis spats
and was captured."—S.F. Examiner.
They tnoan and wail
Do all the ''Rats."
Their chief's in jail—
Tripped up by spals.
No one was quicker
With his gats
Until (he slicker
Took (o spats.

NO RISK AT ALL
"Miss Dix, who can read the hu
man heart, answering the question,

'Why do girls marry?' gives 'bore
dom, fear, and loneliness' as the im
portant forces pushing toward the
wall. Those forces amount to little.
Big girls marry, as little girls play
with dolls, because nature intends
they shall. Really important things
relating to the preservation and per
petuation of the race we do without
knowing why. Nature does not leave
that to chance."—Arthur Brisbane.

STAMPEDE
"On a recent trip to Sweden," said
Representative William E. Hull of
Illinois, "beer of 3 or 4 per cent was
served at about 25 cents a glass and

every Congressman in our party
rushed up to the bar to drink it."
And what did Joe Siamese
Twin, the confirmed bachelor,
say to his brother, John Siamese
Twin, when the latter got mar
ried?
"You're driving me knots!"
