# Untried Frosh Hoopsters Set For S.F.U. Tomorrow
## DON BABES RATED AS BEST OF BAY REGION FRESHMEN Riesner Lost To Stanford Through Ineligibility; Hamilton Out 
### 
Potentially strong, but lacking re
sirve material, Stanford's untried
freshman basketball team opens its
reason tomorrow night against the
Wrongest first-year team in the Bay
Region San Francisco University.
The phantom axe of ineligibility
lias cut Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
host forward, Johnny Reisner, from
ihe ranks of available material,
rhreo other players, experienced
men, but unacquainted with Stan
lord basketball, will not play. They
have not yet practiced long enough
with other members of Bradshaw's
outfit? to insure a capable perform
ance in tomorrow's game. Bones
Hamilton, a fine forward, has passed
lip basketball for baseball activities.
No Center Found
And so the tale of woe goes on!
This year's freshman team will
have no center—unless some un
known giant comes out of hiding
within the next few days. Conclud
ing futile searching for a tall tip-off
man that does not exist, Charles
Viguie, short-statured alongside
oven the average forward, has been
shifted to center. He will do well to
control the tip-ofT a dozen times to
morrow night.
Forwards Ralph Mannion and
Wallace Brooke prep stars at San
Frailcisco and Santa Monica, are
also short men. They are less ex
perienced, and show no more prom
isel than last year's scoreless fresh
man forwards.
Guards Good
Guard prospects lend rays of hope
to an otherwise dark situation. Ad
die Barnett and Don Maentz, smooth,
polished players, though themselves
no giants, measure lip to last year's
brilliant freshman pair: Gordon
Mallatratt and Joe Butte.
Barnett, a Santa Monica lad, has
been the boy in daily
workouts and in the only practice
game of the season, a tilt with the
Mountain View High School team
which resulted in an overwhelming
victory for the Indians.

Throe Substitutes

Only three substitutes are now
ready for intercollegiate competition:
Syd Rosenberg, a forward; Dave
Fnrber and Henry Bergman, guards.
II Bradshaw has to use any other
members of his Papoose squad, the
Stanford cause will darken percep
tibly.
Enough for Stanford.
S.F.U. Rales Iligli
San Francisco's five most import
ant games have resulted in easy vic
tories for the Dons:
31 Sequoia High ,17
35 St. James High 15

29 St. Ignatius 11
24 Lowell High 12

freshmen are likely to prove strong

The phantom axe of ineligibility
lias cut Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
host forward, Johnny Reisner, from
ihe ranks of available material,
rhreo other players, experienced
men, but unacquainted with Stan
lord basketball, will not play. They
have not yet practiced long enough
with other members of Bradshaw's
outfit? to insure a capable perform
ance in tomorrow's game. Bones
Hamilton, a fine forward, has passed
lip basketball for baseball activities.
No Center Found
And so the tale of woe goes on!
This year's freshman team will
have no center—unless some un
known giant comes out of hiding
within the next few days. Conclud
ing futile searching for a tall tip-off
man that does not exist, Charles
Viguie, short-statured alongside
oven the average forward, has been
shifted to center. He will do well to
control the tip-ofT a dozen times to
morrow night.
Forwards Ralph Mannion and
Wallace Brooke prep stars at San
Frailcisco and Santa Monica, are
also short men. They are less ex
perienced, and show no more prom
isel than last year's scoreless fresh
man forwards.
Guards Good
Guard prospects lend rays of hope
to an otherwise dark situation. Ad
die Barnett and Don Maentz, smooth,
polished players, though themselves
no giants, measure lip to last year's
brilliant freshman pair: Gordon
Mallatratt and Joe Butte.
Barnett, a Santa Monica lad, has
been the boy in daily
workouts and in the only practice
game of the season, a tilt with the
Mountain View High School team
which resulted in an overwhelming
victory for the Indians.

Throe Substitutes

Only three substitutes are now
ready for intercollegiate competition:
Syd Rosenberg, a forward; Dave
Fnrber and Henry Bergman, guards.
II Bradshaw has to use any other
members of his Papoose squad, the
Stanford cause will darken percep
tibly.
Enough for Stanford.
S.F.U. Rales Iligli
San Francisco's five most import
ant games have resulted in easy vic
tories for the Dons:
31 Sequoia High ,17
35 St. James High 15
31 Mission High 17
29 St. Ignatius 11
24 Lowell High 12
Excluding "Little Big Games" with
California's Bear Cubs, S.F.U.'s
freshmen are likely to prove strong
er than the remainder of Stanford's
yearling opponents. Thus tomorrow
night's game assumes the nature of
nn acid test for (lie Indians. Coach
James Bradshaw docs not expect
Stanford to win.
Potentially strong, but lacking re
sirve material, Stanford's untried
freshman basketball team opens its
reason tomorrow night against the
Wrongest first-year team in the Bay
Region San Francisco University.
