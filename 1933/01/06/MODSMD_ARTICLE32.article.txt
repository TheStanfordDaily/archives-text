# CAN 1933 MATCH THESE?

FIRST CALIFORNIA PUTS
OUT a bulletin which shows that
they won all of eight out of fif
teen games in something or other
from somebody, then the Butler
Report fails to explode, and
finally Phil Smith and Charlie
Seaver decide not to return to
school.
Maybe technocracy would be bet
ter.
Anyhow, Coacn Maloney has hio
eye peeled for at least a good heavy
weight, and Head Man Twiggs is
searching the bunkers for someone
to take Charlie Seaver's place.
With Smith out, and Palamoun
tain seemingly indisposed, what
looked like one of the best boxing
teams in Stanford history now ap
pears slightly bedraggled.
Malo.ney had two men in almost
everything but the light-heavy and
heavyweight classes, and one good
man in each of those. Now, unless
Keith Topping is able to box and
basketball at the same time, Maloney
has two weights that are anything
but cheering. However, there is a
good chance that Topping can carry
the mail for both coaches, and Phil
Johnston may be able to gain enough
experience to back up his wallop
before the real season gets under
way.
Coach Twiggs is in just as tough
a spot, for Seaver was his top-rung
man on the golf ladder, and he had
been expected to lead the team
through an undefeated season this
coming spring.

WE AREN'T AWFULLY sur
prised that the Butler Bobshell

failed to explode, but what we
should like to know is "can it
be true that ALL the little boys
in the conference NEVER play
in the mud, or is it that self
preservation really IS the first
instinct of man." (Psych majors
pleeze to skip last.)
At any rate, the excuse offered,
that he never made a fair catch be
cause the conference rules are too
vague, is either pure, distilled hooey,
or the conference is worth even less
than we thought it was. Evidently
its proselyting clauses are in the
same state of disrepair that its eligi
bility rules are. Or were we thinking
of some of the agreements between
California universities?
