# Tennis Managerships Open To Sophomore Candidates
## 
### 
With the managerial system being
completed for the tennis season, the
need for sophomore managers was
issued by the senior tennis manager.
Of course the sophomore duties
take the regular place of lower divi
sion requirements in gym, with the
requirements for tennis duties being
three afternoons attendance each
week out at the tennis courts.
All sophomores interested in be
coming tennis managers can sign up
with the senior manager out at the
courts or with Coach Bugge in the
gym.
By English ancient law a man
might fight his accuser to prove his
innocence.
