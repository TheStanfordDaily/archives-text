# QUARTET OF TRACK STARS RETURNS TO FARM FOR SEASON
## L. Hables Among Aces Who Brighten Outlook For Spring Tourneys 
### Dick Strouse 
The new vintage of names regis
tered this quarter that did not ap
pear in the autumn quarter bawlout
includes four that are important at
Stanford in a trackish or cinderish
or "Beat U.S.C." sort of way.
The quartet, which includes Las
Hables, Bud Deacon, Frank Lom
bardi, and Phil Morentin, may com
bine with track men of a kind more
consistently enrolled at Stanford to
give Dink Templeton one of his
strongest dual meet teams. This
combination will occur if no spike
man has scholastic, monetary, or
hospital trouble before the Trojan
meet.
Hables and Lombardi are a great
combination, but all will be useless
if Lombardi's bad k'g is still bad or
if Hables finds it impossible to re
gain his form after his startling in
juries. At present, Frank is playing
baseball and Les is taking things
easy on the track.
Deacon is the former Stanford
pole-vaulter who reached 13 feet 10
inches in the final Olympic trials to
tie for third place behind Indian Bill
Miller and Trojan Bill Graber. Al
though Deaccn, Zimmerman, and
Sturdy lost the jump-off to Jefferson
of U.C.L.A., Miller and Deacon are
probably two of the three best pole
vaulters still eligible for college
competition.
Phil Morentin is a great two
miler, but with Amdahl and Azevedo
back from the 1932 varsity and with
Jim Ferrie alone in the mile, either
Morentin or Azevedo is going to be
come a miler this year.
