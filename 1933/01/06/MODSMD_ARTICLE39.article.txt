# SIX TENNIS STARS RETURN TO FARM FOR 1933 SEASON
## Coughlin, Otis, Lee Show Promise For Pacific Net Tournaments 
### 
Since the first six seeded players
avoided the heavy hand of faculty
committees and passed all last quar
ter's finals, Card tennis hopes for a
very powerful 1933 tennis team ap
pear extremely bright.
Even the weather man seems to
have come through with unusually
good tennis days. All through
Christmas vacation most of the squad
kept up Lliclr shape. Some entered
holiday tourn; ments around their
local communities and managed in
that way to continue placing con
sistent tennir.
Probably th;? most important news
is the fact that al' six of the men
Coach Sherman Lockwood will
count upon to bear the brunt of
conference matches will be available
for the tennis engagements in the
spring.
They will be headed by Joe
Coughlin, left-handed player and
captain of the net team. Coughlin is
a player to be reckoned with in col
legiate tennis circles on the Pacific
Coast. Together with Gledhill he
holds the Intercollegiate Doubles
title, besides probably being a strong
enough singles player to win most
of his matches this season.
Big Chuck Otis will hold down the
second position, but with plenty of
competition from last year's frosh
captain, Sammy Lee. Probably the
most improved man of the first six,
Glenn Reed, looms as a favorite to
give Dan Ellis, Jack Cosgrove, and
Hubert Butler a hard run. Another
netman by the name of Blethen has
registered, and much is expected of
him.
