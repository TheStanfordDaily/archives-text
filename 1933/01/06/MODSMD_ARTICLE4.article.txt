# "Gigolo Clubs" Brighten Coeds' Depression Days

### 
Co-eds of the nation's univer
sities are grappling with the
"date" depression in a big way.
At the University of Wash
ington, 70 per cent of the
women admit they pay part of
the bill when out with the boy
friend. Some pay only their part
of the refreshment bill; others
furnish car, gas, and cigarettes.
One, after financing her male
escort in a social way for sev
eral months, bought her own
engagement ring.
A "gigolo club" just organized
at Tulanc University has an
nounced it will provide "at
tractive. well-dressed dates" for
all occasions for "small remu
neration."
No names of "clients" will be
made public, the club promises.
An escort to a formal party will
collect a fee of $2, while in
formal dates will cost the girl
.SI.
"Any expenses, including
taxis, shows, flowers, night club
checks, and similar items, na
turally will be paid by the
woman," a campus advertise
ment declares.
