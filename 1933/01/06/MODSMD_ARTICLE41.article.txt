# COAST QUINTETS WARM UP FOR CONFERENCE LAURELS
## 
### 
While Stanford's traveling basket
ball team finally comes home to
roost this morning and will face
S.F.U. 'tomorrow night in the Pa
vilion, the remainder of the Coast
conference teams are being moulded
intb shape and are entering their
final week of pre-season practice
games before they swing into the
more serjpus business of opposing
each other in league warfare. Al
though the Cards have been tabbed
the "weak sisters" of the southern
division of the conference, the addi
tion of Keith Topping may raise
Stanford to a position of real im- ,
portance.
Over at Berkeley, beneath the
made of the stately Campanile,
"Nibs"' Price is quietly building what
might develop into California's 1
greatest team. Price has the task of
defending the Coast championship
won last year. Having lost only two
men from the '32 brigade, and with
such stellar performers as Captain
Jack Read, Joe Seifert, Ted Ohashi,
Johnnie Crowley, and Hal Eifert, to
mention just a few, back in harness, j
Price should not find his job of
turning out a strong California team
a very difficult one.

With Jerry Nemer and sophomore
Lee Guttero playing super basket
hall, the aspect of putting forth a
winning team at the University of
Southern California has become a
brilliant hue. The Trojans wore very
close to the top last year, and now,
since they lost but one man from
the '32 regular five, they appear to
have the most promising chances of
winning this season's race. In addi
tion to Nemer and Guttero, Coach
Sam Barry will use Holbrook, El
liot, Findloy, Kelly, Foss, and Hal
pern to help "fight for old S.C."
Caddy Works, who generates the
power behind U.C.L.A. basketball,
i? promising the Bruin supporters
one of their best teams in years, and
is calling upon ten brilliant players
to carry out his promise. Among
these men are Captain Ted Lemcke,
Cordner Gibson, Bill Maxwell,
George Brotemarkle, Bill Athey,
Jack Piper, and Lou Rose, a formid
able array and one that will givo
the other coast squads real competi
tion in the coming contests.
Raphael, the great Renaissance
painter, first won fame as an archi
test.
