# 'Technocracy' Only Slang Says Professor LaPiere
## 
### Elizabeth Paine 
Predicting for the current fad of
"technocracy" a life-span equal to
that of any popular slang phrase,
Professor Richard T. LaPiere of the
Department of Sociology yesterday
gave an explanation for its present
vogue.
"These fads come and go so often
they are not worth serious thought,"
said La Piere. "Our society is highly
unstable and and unrestrained by
rigid customs and so is susceptible
to violent fashions. As soon as peo
ple tire of the catchword they will
drop it since they do not know what
it means. These fashions which
sweep the country are usually mani
fested in trivial forms, tolerated but
not remarked."
In the unrest of the depression the
cycle of the malady became political.
Recent social, economical, and po
litical events have caused the mass
of the people to lose faith in the
conventional political leaders. The
field is left open to the worst sort

of charletans. A lost faith must be
supplanted by another for such is
man's nature.
"Democracy as a concept has fallen
into disapproval and needing a sub
stitute faith many otherwise well
informed people have accepted the
faith of technocracy about which
they know even less than about
democracy."
The much resounded word was
coined in 1920 by W. H. Smythe, a
thoughtful political scientist. The
"false prophet" who leads the tech
nocrats is an "unpunctured wind
bag" that has borrowed and abused
the term, in the opinion of La Piere.
"While the concept that is being
advanced is based upon a principle
recognized since the days of Adam
Smith, the interpretation is entirely
mistaken and the statistical facts
are pure fantasy. A technocrat is
simply an unemployed technician
looking for a job."
