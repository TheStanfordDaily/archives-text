# SORORITIES OPEN RUSHING SEASON
## Robleites To Receive First Invitations Today 
### 
Women's rushing opened officially
this morning with the distribution in
Roble of first-week invitations. All
day today Row and Roble telephone
lines will be humming as the new
women answer their invitations in
the customary manner.
Opening with luncheon tomorrow,
the first period will extend through
Tuesday. This will be followed by
two days of silence, after which the
second period will begin, lasting from
Friday, January 13, through Thurs
day, January 19, with bidding on
Friday, January 20. Because of the
A.S.S.U. concert there is to be no
dinner date on Wednesday, Janu
ary 18.
Dates during rushing will consist
of luncheon lasting from 12 to 1:30
o'clock and dinner from 6:15 to 8:30
o'clock, with Sunday noon dates
lasting from 1 to 2:30 o'clock.
All new winter quarter women
will be invited to each house dur
ing the first period. During the first
period no woman may be asked back
to any house, and during the sec
ond period only one date in ad
vance may be made with each house.
There are approximately 170
women eligible to be rushed, of
which 110 are freshmen. Last year
82 "went Row," the largest number
in recent years.
New Pan-Hellenic regulations
which will go into effect this rush
ing season are: that no house may
ask a new woman to break a date
already made with another house;
that only one sorority woman take
each freshman home; that the rush
ees not be escorted to the doors of
Roble; and that no house may phone
a new woman.
Pan-Hellenic has passed resolu
tions cutting down expenses by
limiting the amounts to be spent on
food and decorations. All rushing
regulations have been very strictly
enforced this year by Pan-Hellenic,
three houses already having been
penalized for illegal conduct.
