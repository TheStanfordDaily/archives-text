# CARD HOOPMEN RETURN TODAY FOR S.F.U. TILT
## Barnstorming lour Brings Three Victories, Eight Indian Defeats 
### Dick Strouse 
Invading Stanford University for a
series of games against Stanford
University and the other teams in
the California division of the Pacific
Coast Conference, Stanford's ma
rauding basketball team will wan
der back to the Farm some time
this morning for a ten weeks' stay
in which Coach John Bunn's eleven j
nomads will have time to rest from I
their vacationless holidays.
The Southern Pacific Railroad has
kindly co-operated with Basketball
Manager Don Cameron, and will
probably deposit the Card cagers at
the Palo Alto depot at 10:29 o'clock
this morning. The Indians are due
in San Francisco at 8:50 o'clock on
the Overnight Limited; the time of
their arrival here is problematical.

The eleven storming basketeers
who sacrificed their vacations at
home because of their love for their
alma mater include forwards Cordry,
Page, Glasgow, and Palmer; guards
Hancock, Tod, Schnetka, Schnabel,
and Weaver; and centers Edelen and
Hoerner.
Cordry, the diminutive Jack-in
the-box of Coast basketball, was
chosen Stanford's cage captain for
1933 at Reno, and seems certain of
one forward bei'th.
Palmer Forward
Payne Palmer at present holds a
slight edge over Chuck Glasgow for
the other forward, but Keith Top
ping may have something to say
i about someone's position.
Although no official welcome has
been planned for the team, Topping
and the Registrar are two who are
certain to welcome them: the former
because he did not make the trip,
and the latter because he is the
gentleman who will be unable to
collect two dollars apiece from the
eleven for late registration because
they will have a valid excuse.
Hancock, Tod Guards
Colossal John Hancock and grid
der Jay Tod seem set as the Stan
ford guards for a time at least, and
Hal Edelen looks like the regular
center. These three, with Captain
Cordry and Palmer, will probably
open for Stanford against S.F.U. to
morrow night in the Indians' first
home game.
Proving himself a marvelous crys
tal-gazer, prophet, forecaster, or
palm-reader, Cwach Bunn's predic
tion that Stanford would not win
more than three games on the trip
proved exactly true. Stanford did
not win more than three games, nor
did Stanford win less than three
games. The final count was three
won and eight lost.
Dons Look Good
Coach Wally Cameron brings a
tall, powerful team of Dons to the
Farm tomorrow night that have
looked impressive in the few games
they have played to date. They are
headed by a rapidly developing
sophomore named Albers, and figure
to be in good shape for the game in
of reputed injuries: the Presi
dent of S.F.U. dismissed the students
of S.F.U. for a four-day holiday re
cently, and the cagers should have :
sufficient time to recover.
