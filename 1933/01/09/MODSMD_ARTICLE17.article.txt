# CAGERS BEATEN BY DONS; PLAY GAELS TONIGHT
## Early Indian Lead Useless As Cameron's Quintet Ends With Spurt S.F.U. 30, STANFORD 25 Cards Favored In Practice Game With St. Mary's 
### Dick Strouse 
Meeting Gaels, Irishmen, and
Moragans all at one and the same
time, Stanford's basketball varsity
will climax its practice season with a
! game against the stronger-than
; usual St. Mary's quintet at 8 o'clock
! tonight in the Pavilion.
In preparation for this evening's
, debacle of basketballs falling
j through hoops and basketball play
; ers falling onto the floor, and in
| their first appearance of the Stanford
j season, Coach John Bunn's traveling
' troupe of gunnery artists were out
shot 25 to 30 Saturday by the S.F.U.
I artillery.
Cards Should Win
In spite of the improvement of St.
Mary's, Scout Rabbit Bradshaw has
; rated the St. Mary's Gaels below the
; S.F.U. Dons and Coach Bunn expects
] a victory for Stanford this evening.
Bunn plans to start the five that
rolled up 13 points while holding
1 S.F.U. to one free throw in the first
| ten minutes of Saturday's game.
This team includes Captain Tom
| Cordry and Keith Topping at the
forwards, Hal Edelen at center, and
; Jay Tod and John Hancock at guard.
I When unmolested by injuries or the
threat of being ejected for four per
sonal fouls, these boys passed around
! and through and over the bewil-
I dered Dons.
A Dozen Ahead
After having built up their 12-
i point, lead, the starting five against
S.F.U. was broken up when Topping
j left the game with'a twisted ankle.
1 Previous to his early exit, he had
scored six of the thirteen points with
j three handsome field goals out of
I only five attempts.
Soon after the second period
| opened, Edelen and Topping fouled
themselves onto the bench. With
j Hancock playing center for the first
i time this season, Stanford reduced
a 21 to 16 Don lead to 22-all. Where
j upon Captain Cordry joined his
I sweat-suited pals on the bench when
he committed his fourth personal
j foul.
Fight Not Enough
That reduced Stanford's scoring
threat to negative zero, and in spite
! of Tod's smashing, heady, win-want -
j ing play, and although Stanford
j staggered up to a 25 to 22 lead,
; S.F.U. ran out eight points and the
! ball game.
Stanford lost because of the zeal
I of two University of Kansas and five
! Stanford students. The zealous Kan-
J sans are important because somc
| where and somehow in that state
two Stanford basketball uniforms
| disappeared. This made it impossible
; for Coach Bunn to dress Jack Hoer-
I ner and Fred Schnabel in correct
I formal basketball attire, and Coach
; Bunn therefore had only one center
* ready to play.
Diplomacy Best
The Stanford zeal caused the
• Cards to try so hard that they
I opened their defense too wide, and
they found that more diplomatic
