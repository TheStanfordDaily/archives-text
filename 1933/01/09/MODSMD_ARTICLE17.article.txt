# CAGERS BEATEN BY DONS; PLAY GAELS TONIGHT
## Early Indian Lead Useless As Cameron's Quintet Ends With Spurt S.F.U. 30, STANFORD 25 Cards Favored In Practice Game With St. Mary's 
### Dick Strouse 
Meeting Gaels, Irishmen, and
Moragans all at one and the same
time, Stanford's basketball varsity
will climax its practice season with a
! game against the stronger-than
; usual St. Mary's quintet at 8 o'clock
! tonight in the Pavilion.
In preparation for this evening's
, debacle of basketballs falling
j through hoops and basketball play
; ers falling onto the floor, and in
| their first appearance of the Stanford
j season, Coach John Bunn's traveling
' troupe of gunnery artists were out
shot 25 to 30 Saturday by the S.F.U.
I artillery.
Cards Should Win
In spite of the improvement of St.
Mary's, Scout Rabbit Bradshaw has
; rated the St. Mary's Gaels below the
; S.F.U. Dons and Coach Bunn expects
] a victory for Stanford this evening.
Bunn plans to start the five that
rolled up 13 points while holding
1 S.F.U. to one free throw in the first
| ten minutes of Saturday's game.
This team includes Captain Tom
| Cordry and Keith Topping at the
forwards, Hal Edelen at center, and
; Jay Tod and John Hancock at guard.
I When unmolested by injuries or the
threat of being ejected for four per
sonal fouls, these boys passed around
! and through and over the bewil-
I dered Dons.
A Dozen Ahead
After having built up their 12-
i point, lead, the starting five against
S.F.U. was broken up when Topping
j left the game with'a twisted ankle.
1 Previous to his early exit, he had
scored six of the thirteen points with
j three handsome field goals out of
I only five attempts.
Soon after the second period
| opened, Edelen and Topping fouled
themselves onto the bench. With
j Hancock playing center for the first
i time this season, Stanford reduced
a 21 to 16 Don lead to 22-all. Where
j upon Captain Cordry joined his
I sweat-suited pals on the bench when
he committed his fourth personal
j foul.
Fight Not Enough
That reduced Stanford's scoring
threat to negative zero, and in spite
! of Tod's smashing, heady, win-want -
j ing play, and although Stanford
j staggered up to a 25 to 22 lead,
; S.F.U. ran out eight points and the
! ball game.
Stanford lost because of the zeal
I of two University of Kansas and five
! Stanford students. The zealous Kan-
J sans are important because somc
| where and somehow in that state
two Stanford basketball uniforms
| disappeared. This made it impossible
; for Coach Bunn to dress Jack Hoer-
I ner and Fred Schnabel in correct
I formal basketball attire, and Coach
; Bunn therefore had only one center
* ready to play.
Diplomacy Best
The Stanford zeal caused the
• Cards to try so hard that they
I opened their defense too wide, and
they found that more diplomatic
guarding would have been the bet
ter part of ambition.
Cordry, Topping, Tod, and Han
cock accounted for 22 points of the
Indian total, and they give Bunn
four real basketball players. Captain
Tom was all that Associated Press
dispatches from the wilds of Wyom
ing and Utah said of him. And bru
nette Topping still seems the fair
haired boy who is going to make
the Card quintet.
4 Down, 1 To Go
Tod has improved so much that
there was much rubbing of eyes in
the press box to see if that fighting
number 41 who dove for the ball
when it was free as though he
thought it were Orv Mohler really
was good old Jay. And Hancock has
lost his 1932 awkwardness and is an
offensive as well as a defensive
threat.
Frankly, this hard-fighting re
porter was agreeably surprised by
the Stanford showing. All Bunn
1 needs is a fifth man: perhaps it will
be smooth-passing Edelen in spite
of his poor shooting; perhaps it will
be Bill Schnetku, who looked good
Saturday; perhaps keen-eyed Payne
Palmer or lanky Dave Packard or
I suitless Schnabcl

a 21 to 16 Don lead to 22-all. Where
j upon Captain Cordry joined his
I sweat-suited pals on the bench when

j foul.
Fight Not Enough
That reduced Stanford's scoring
threat to negative zero, and in spite
! of Tod's smashing, heady, win-want -
j ing play, and although Stanford
j staggered up to a 25 to 22 lead,
; S.F.U. ran out eight points and the
! ball game.
Stanford lost because of the zeal
I of two University of Kansas and five
! Stanford students. The zealous Kan-
J sans are important because somc
| where and somehow in that state
two Stanford basketball uniforms
| disappeared. This made it impossible
; for Coach Bunn to dress Jack Hoer-
I ner and Fred Schnabel in correct
I formal basketball attire, and Coach
; Bunn therefore had only one center
* ready to play.
Diplomacy Best
The Stanford zeal caused the
• Cards to try so hard that they
I opened their defense too wide, and
they found that more diplomatic
guarding would have been the bet
ter part of ambition.
Cordry, Topping, Tod, and Han
cock accounted for 22 points of the
Indian total, and they give Bunn
four real basketball players. Captain
Tom was all that Associated Press
dispatches from the wilds of Wyom
ing and Utah said of him. And bru
nette Topping still seems the fair
haired boy who is going to make
the Card quintet.
4 Down, 1 To Go
Tod has improved so much that
there was much rubbing of eyes in
the press box to see if that fighting
number 41 who dove for the ball
when it was free as though he
thought it were Orv Mohler really
was good old Jay. And Hancock has
lost his 1932 awkwardness and is an
offensive as well as a defensive
threat.
Frankly, this hard-fighting re
porter was agreeably surprised by
the Stanford showing. All Bunn
1 needs is a fifth man: perhaps it will
be smooth-passing Edelen in spite
of his poor shooting; perhaps it will
be Bill Schnetku, who looked good
Saturday; perhaps keen-eyed Payne
Palmer or lanky Dave Packard or
I suitless Schnabcl
Meeting Gaels, Irishmen, and
Moragans all at one and the same
time, Stanford's basketball varsity
will climax its practice season with a

shot 25 to 30 Saturday by the S.F.U.
I artillery.
Cards Should Win
In spite of the improvement of St.
Mary's, Scout Rabbit Bradshaw has
; rated the St. Mary's Gaels below the
; S.F.U. Dons and Coach Bunn expects
] a victory for Stanford this evening.
Bunn plans to start the five that
rolled up 13 points while holding
1 S.F.U. to one free throw in the first
| ten minutes of Saturday's game.
This team includes Captain Tom
| Cordry and Keith Topping at the
forwards, Hal Edelen at center, and
; Jay Tod and John Hancock at guard.
I When unmolested by injuries or the
threat of being ejected for four per
sonal fouls, these boys passed around
! and through and over the bewil-
I dered Dons.
A Dozen Ahead
After having built up their 12-
i point, lead, the starting five against
S.F.U. was broken up when Topping
j left the game with'a twisted ankle.
1 Previous to his early exit, he had
scored six of the thirteen points with
j three handsome field goals out of
I only five attempts.
