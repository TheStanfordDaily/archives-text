Wearing the same ol<l cap llial he sported around the
Farm when he was just one of the hired hands, "Tinv"
Thornhi]l sauntered out into the lohhv of the basketball
Pavilion between halves Saturday night. It was apparently
the same old "Tiny," always with plenty to say, joking,
laughing, and munching peanuts much the same as he
munched peanuts between halves in the Pavilion lobby
last year.
Hut there was a difference. Then Tiny was always one
in a group that centered around Pop Warner. Last night
there was no Pop by his side, and Tiny himself was the
center of attraction. He seemed to be getting along all
right without the Old Man.
All around, it is an impression of confidence that Tinv
gives, Tiny in the spotlight alone, without the steady Old
Fox to lean upon.
Hut when Autumn quarter rolls around and the actual
job of turning back a lot of good football teams begins,
Tiny will need more than supreme self-confidence; more
even than good material upon which to direct coaching
ability that he lias already proved, as Pop's assistant, to
be excellent.
He'll need the confidence and active backing of every
fan on the Farm, whether student, alumni, or facultv.
