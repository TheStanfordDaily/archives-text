W here the little while hall rolls, and why il rolls that
way that's what the San Francisco Examiner is telling its
readers these days. On the face of it, the Examiner's cru
sade against "fixed" gambling tables in the city looks pretty
courageous. It might be at that, were it to be conducted
in the Middle-Western metropolis, but it is extremely
doubtful that there are any "big shots" interested in the
San Francisco gambling racket at the present time.
Kven without the zestful lure of actual danger, however,
the paper's expose of the small factor of chance actually
involved in the operation of the city's "palaces of chance"
is a pretty worthwhile service. It is a service, incidentally,
which will practically coerce the native servants of the
people, protectors of the peace, etc., into performing the
duties they have been elected and appointed to do.
The Examiner is obviously sympathetic with the "suck
ers" who have been dragged along the stony path at the
hands of crooked dealers and "house-odds" gambling de
vices. Not so obviously, but no doubt just as sincerely, the
paper is sympathetic with the much larger ntimber of
suckers who have been paying taxes in the good faith thai
such activities are being suppressed in their foggy city.
This much is certain the Examiner has certainly
started citizens of San Francisco to thinking and talking
about the situation. Most likely even old John Law himself,
who occupies a epiite obscure position at times, will sit up
and take notice.
