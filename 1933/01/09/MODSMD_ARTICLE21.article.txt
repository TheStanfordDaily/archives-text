# A 						GOOD ACTIVITY
## 
### 
There is nothing more pathetic than Ihe student who
arrives at the threshold of his senior year with the realiza
tion that he has failed to eateli the spirit of Stanford dur
ing his three years of undergraduate life.
Active competition in extra curricular activities is one
of the best ways to acquire this rightly prized spirit. Be
cause sport is one of the integral parts of college life, the
managers who are connected with the various varsities are
in an ideal position to get an understanding of this spirit.
In other words, you are in the "swim."
Sophomores with their required physical education
which takes up their time do not realize the lack of aomc-
Ihitif/ to do which attacks many upper division men. Fur
thermore most sophomores are in a period of adjustment,
cither getting used to living in Ihe Halls or on the Row, and
do not realize that in the near future they will have a lot of
lime on their hands.
Right now it is not 100 late to sign up for sophomore
manager jobs in baseball, track, basketball, swimming, and
tennis. As junior manager and later as senior manager Ihe
undergraduate gets a chance to take many interesting trips.
There is also invaluable experience gained in a business
way and in meeting and dealing with men in different
walks of life.
You have to work hard, it is true, but Ihe experience
amply repays anyone for Ihe hours spent, (iivc it a try and
see how vou like it.
