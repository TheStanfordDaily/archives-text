# BULL SESSION
## OUR BAFFLING BOOKSTORE 
### 
Friday, the Bookstore was com
pared with its own record in former
years and the results were quite
hilarious—economically speaking. We
learned that in years past they wei-e
able to do MORE business on LESS
salary. This has finally caused a
mess wherein the monopolistic Book
Trust shows almost a $2,000 loss, pays
a miserable 3 per cent rebate to
students, and rebates on small pur
chases have petered out entirely!
Now, let's compare the NON
PROFIT BOOK TRUST to some
figures released by the Harvard Bu
reau of Business Research. The com
parison is not exactly precise, but
near enough to startle the most
stolid. The comparison shows that
either the Book Trust is out of step
with 146 general stationery firms, or
that the rest of the country is out of
step with the Book Trust. It REAL
LY shows that the Book Trust is in
step with itself and no one else!
The' Harvard analysis shows that
the Bookstore should pay $26,000 in
salaries. They PAID $30,000 in 1932.
Where'is that $4,000 difference? The
students might be interested in
knowing. The Harvard figures were
collected in 1928 when salaries gen
erally were higher. Now the story
would be even worse for our Baffling
Bookstore.
The Harvard analysis shows that
a business the size of our Bookstore

would have to pay a rental of over
$6,000 per year. Our Blundering
Bookstore has a cheerful, cozy store
for $1,000 per year. Where is that
saving of $5,000 in rental? We do not
begrudge the cozy comfort of the
Bookstore. We merely evidence curi
osity on how such a possible saving
is liquidated, then rarefied, and fi
nally disposed of.
The Beloved Bookstore has prac
tically no delivery costs. According
to the Harvard Bureau, this probably
nets them iibout $2,000. The fact that
the Book Trust has a virtual mono
poly probably accounts for their low
advertising expenditure. As com
pared to a regular business, they
save nearly another $2,000 in this
department.
There is no end to this sort of j
thing, but already there is some
$13,000 that needs explaining away, j
And to explain it away is some job.
As we have said before we do not
feel that there is any ACTUAL DIS- i
HONESTY in the operation of the
NON-PROFIT BOOK TRUST. There j
are some highly baffling conditions, j
There are some startling facts.
These facts and conditions need
explaining. The Campus has a right 1
to know where the money is going
and why it is going. The Baffling
Bookstore still remains a baffling
enigma—an economic contradiction—
a challenge! —Abe Mellinkoff

mess wherein the monopolistic Book
Trust shows almost a $2,000 loss, pays
a miserable 3 per cent rebate to
students, and rebates on small pur
chases have petered out entirely!
Now, let's compare the NON
PROFIT BOOK TRUST to some
figures released by the Harvard Bu
reau of Business Research. The com
parison is not exactly precise, but
near enough to startle the most
stolid. The comparison shows that
either the Book Trust is out of step
with 146 general stationery firms, or
that the rest of the country is out of
step with the Book Trust. It REAL
LY shows that the Book Trust is in
step with itself and no one else!
The' Harvard analysis shows that
the Bookstore should pay $26,000 in
salaries. They PAID $30,000 in 1932.
Where'is that $4,000 difference? The
students might be interested in
knowing. The Harvard figures were
collected in 1928 when salaries gen
erally were higher. Now the story
would be even worse for our Baffling
Bookstore.
The Harvard analysis shows that
a business the size of our Bookstore

would have to pay a rental of over
$6,000 per year. Our Blundering
Bookstore has a cheerful, cozy store
for $1,000 per year. Where is that
saving of $5,000 in rental? We do not
begrudge the cozy comfort of the
Bookstore. We merely evidence curi
osity on how such a possible saving
is liquidated, then rarefied, and fi
nally disposed of.
The Beloved Bookstore has prac
tically no delivery costs. According
to the Harvard Bureau, this probably
nets them iibout $2,000. The fact that
the Book Trust has a virtual mono
poly probably accounts for their low
advertising expenditure. As com
pared to a regular business, they
save nearly another $2,000 in this
department.
There is no end to this sort of j
thing, but already there is some
$13,000 that needs explaining away, j
And to explain it away is some job.
As we have said before we do not
feel that there is any ACTUAL DIS- i
HONESTY in the operation of the
NON-PROFIT BOOK TRUST. There j
are some highly baffling conditions, j
There are some startling facts.
These facts and conditions need
explaining. The Campus has a right 1
to know where the money is going
and why it is going. The Baffling
Bookstore still remains a baffling
enigma—an economic contradiction—
a challenge! —Abe Mellinkoff
Friday, the Bookstore was com
pared with its own record in former
years and the results were quite
hilarious—economically speaking. We
learned that in years past they wei-e
able to do MORE business on LESS
salary. This has finally caused a
mess wherein the monopolistic Book
Trust shows almost a $2,000 loss, pays
a miserable 3 per cent rebate to
students, and rebates on small pur
chases have petered out entirely!
