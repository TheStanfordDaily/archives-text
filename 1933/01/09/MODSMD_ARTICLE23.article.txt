THE ANIMAL KINGDOM—(RKO)
—(Although no longer at the Stan
ford Theatre, this film will be
shown elsewhere, and is worthy
of consideration.)
Every once and a while there ap
pears a film which makes a reviewer
regret the superlatives she ha£ wast
ed in the past and search for new
and adequate ones. Such a picture is
"The Animal Kingdom," which E.
H. Griffith has faithfully directed
from the Philip Barry play.
The merit of the film lies in the
successfu handling of the Barry
play, which is of no particular con
sequence as a story, but which offers
opportunity for at least four stellar
perfoi-mances.
The fragile plot of "The Animal
Kingdom" revolves around a man
who discovers that his wife is mere
ly his legalized mistress, and his
sweetheart the woman he should
have made his wife. It is the story
of two loves, one of understanding
and one of desire; from the latter
comes the title: "For all our big talk,
we still belong to the animal king
dom," says the script.
The "big talk" of the film is really

excellently handled small talk,
spoken by a cast whose skill lies in
making its big talk. This marks the
nearest return Barry has made to
the sparkling dialogue of "Holiday" |
since his more serious works.
"The Animal Kingdom" brings i
Leslie Howard to the screen in the
role he created on the stage, and
provides opportunity for us to view
his excellent work at close range—
his pantomime, his gestures, and his j
subtle penetration of the character
of Tom Collier, who, however il
logical his predicament, is made !
convincing.
The picture also marks the return
of Ann Harding to the happier forte
of "Holiday"; she has not 'been seen
as effectively since her Linda Seton [
in the earlier Barry story. Incred
ibly bad films have not staled Miss ,
Harding's infinite charm and her ex- j
quisite voice, and she has never been
photographed as beautifully.
Usually relegated to playing slant
eyed unpleasant menaces, Myrna
Loy is here given a part which
proves her a truly capable performer
and an attractive person. She han
dles admirably the unsympathetic
role of the wife.
The comedy of the ex-prize-fight
ing butler is played by William Gar
gan with considerable broadness, an
ingenuous smile, and, in one se
quence, skill and sincerity.
Ilka Chase's comedy also pleases;
as do Neil Hamilton and Henry
Stephenson. —Chapin
