HOPE FOR MELLINKOFF
The Editor, Sir:
The latest attack on the Bookstore
has a familiar ring tp some of the
old-timers and causes us to wonder
whether the students are jumping on
the institution "again or yet"; or
whether the author simply feels the
urge to carry on a hallowed tradi
tion.
There comes to mind an incident
of nearly twenty years ago when
separate committees of men and
women students were appointed to
investigate the store. This was done
thoroughly, with the full co-opera
tion of management and directors;
and after full understanding was
reached of policies and methods
which cold figures do not alway re
flect, feeling against the store prac
tically disappeared except for a few
who were unwilling to see an old
legend die.
The private student is not the only
one who occasionally rises to make
such remarks. When the store was
struggling with a particularly diffi
cult situation arising after the war
the editor of the Daily, without
troubling to approach the manage
ment for an understanding of its dif
ficulties, made an attack beside
which the present one seems like a
compliment. However, the institution
survived, the editor went from col
lege to become merchandising man
ager of a city store, and is now presi
dent of a large mercantile organiza
tion in New York City. There is hope
for Mr. Mellinkoff.

DEFENDS HOLLYWOOD
The Editor, Sir:
Hollywood's method of celebrating
Christmas has brought forth protests
not only from the Stanford Daily,
but from many good citizcns, as
well.
Because Hollywood Boulevard was
lined with gaudy pictures of movie
stars during the holidays, people de
cried it as a desecration of Christ's

birthday.
Why do we object to the encroach
ments of the cinema on Christmas?
The holiday has been practically
stripped of its religions implications,
and Santa Claus has become the
symbol of department store commer
cialism.
Christians though we may be,
Hollywood truly reflects the spirit of
modern Christmas, just as the maga
zine "Time" holds the mirror up to
the physical infirmities of our na
tional celebrities.
No longer is the life of Christ our
example, but instead, we strive to
emulate the favorite movie star of
the day.
Russia has renounced the old re
ligion and now worships Lenin.
America forgets Sunday school and
turns adoring eyes to the latest
movie actress.
What could be more appropriate
than to bedeck the modern streets
with movie stars' pictures, rather
than "stars of Bethlehem"?
