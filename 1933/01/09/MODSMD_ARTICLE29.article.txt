# Stanford Babes Lose Opener To San Francisco Frosh
## S.F.U. MUCHACHOS NOSE OUT INDIAN YEARLINGS, 27-20 Jimmy Bradshaw's Quintet Shows Real Promise; Barnett Good 
### Albert Guerard 
They're good!
If you didn't get a chance to see
Stanford's freshman basketball team
lose to San Francisco's "Muchachos"
in a rather shaky debut last Satur
day, 27-20, yet look good in losing—
there's another game tonight, with
St. Mary's freshmen, and chances are
the Indians will touch off their scor
ing guns in a big way.
Better than last year:
This much concerning the 1933
Papooses is certain. The forwards are
faster, better shooters; the centers—
too short for tip-ofT men, are effec
tive under the basket; the guards—
cool players, good passers, are as
strong as last year's stars, Gordon
Mallatratt and Joe Butte.
Papooses Promising
Wobbly on their feet, and far off
range on their shooting, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw's players never
theless succeeded in showing con
siderable promise.
The first field goal of the season
was tanked by Viguie, a Stanford
man, jumping center. Play was hotly
contested during the first half, with
guard Addie Barnett outstanding,
Half-time score was 10-10.
Leroy, Becker, and Sanz gave the
Dons a 16-10 lead before Stanford
realized the second half had started.
Mannion's set-up shot and free
throw closed the gap temporarily,
but a moment .later the score zoomed
to 13-13. In the final minutes of the
game, Mannion and Maentz con
nected with center court baskets, but
the rally came too late.
Lineup Listed
VIGUIE. Charles. A smooth-play
ing center, but far too short. Appar
ency has had plenty of experience.
Shoots a bit too often from outside
the foul line. Saturday night found
him suffering from a bad attack of
"rim eyes."
BROOKE, Wally. Forward. Built
like Tom Cordry, and cat-like on
defense, a very speedy player who
couldn't sink any of his shots against
S.F.U.
MANNION, Ralph. High point man
against S.F.U. with three baskets.
Jumped center after Viguie left the
game. Looks a bit clumsy at times,
but hangs onto the ball in tight
spots. Will probably develop into the
best freshman forward.
Guards Good
BARNETT, Addie. Guard. The
best player on the freshman team.
Cool, graceful, an expert player—
his work recalls that ot Vance Faw
cett.
MAENTZ, Don. A solidly built
guard. His job seems limited to pass
ing the ball to Barnett, and taking
a few long shots. Has better shoot
ing form than any of his teammates.
Good defensively. Maentz bares his
teeth fiercely each time he passes
the ball, thus telegraphing his in
tentions.
Of the substitute players, Syd
Rosenberg played best. Don Green
lee (a new man this quarter) showed
the greatest promise. Greenlee will
probably be worked into a starting
center post before the California
series. A1 Trompas played fair ball
during the short time he was in the
game.
St. Mary's Strong
Stanford's job tonight will be to
Stop Moraga's high-scoring forward,
Rockwell. He has made fifty points
in three games. Spirz and Hannah,
two other Gaels, were bright stars
in high school.
The St. Mary's record:
38 Marin J.C. 27
23 Burlingame Ramblers 31
30 Y.M.C.A. (145's) 20
IS Stockton Hich 30
