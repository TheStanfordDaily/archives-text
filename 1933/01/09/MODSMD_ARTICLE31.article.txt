WELL, FOR FIVE MEN WHO
were playing together for the
first time in a month. Stanford's
varsity basketball quintet did
pretty well Saturday night
against S.F.U.
The Dons were completely bewil
dered for the first fifteen minutes of
the battle, and had a grand total of
one point for most of that initial
quarter of an hour. In fact, they
failed to click at all until the Indians
began to tire.
Contrary to the wise guys who
have the team all catalogued al
ready, the Cards are in excellent
condition. But there <ue very few
men in the business who can travel
on a train as much as they have and
still play top-notch basketball.
And also contrary to a lot of peo
ple. we said last quarter that the
betting sharks were giving four to
one that Stanford wouldn't take a
conference game, NOT that we
thought that the Cards would fail
to crash the winners' column.
EVEN THOUGH HE MAY
NOT have been talking for pub
lication. A1 Masters' views on
the Butler report seem strangely
incongruous in view of the fact
that Butler stated that each time
lie tracked a case down it fell
through for lack of enforceable,
inclusive rules.
As for the Ingram "retort courte
ous," if he was quoted correctly, it's
a laugh. What possible "diffex-ences
in problems and conditions" could
excuse a personal tour, by a head
coach, for the purpose of stirring up
alumni clubs and improving the ath
letic situation at a university. Gate
receipts? Hardly, at a state institu
tion for dissemination of higher
learning, Horace!
POOR OLD KENESAW
MOUNTAIN LANDIS. baseball's
Solomon, is practically set to
surrender to the well - known
wolf. His salary has descended
in the last three years from

$65,000 to a mere paltry $40,000.
Wot a life, wot a life.
THAT GREAT SANTA
CLARA basketball team, which
set sail with such high hopes this
season, seems to have hit very
rough weather. After taking a
whaling at the hands of U.C.L.A.
Friday night, they were com
pletely submerged by U.S.C.
Saturday night.
And the Broncs have never been
able to get going on the Pavilion
floor. They seem to have an awful
time here. With an improved team,
Stanford may take that one after all.
IF YOU STILL HAVE A
yearn to watch the becg boys,
take in the Knights of Columbus
football game in Kezar Stadium,
January 22. The Green Bay
Packers play pro football, wot
is football.
In addition to this, it will probably
be Ernie Nevers' last showing. His
friends have been trying to get him
to quit, and now that he finally has
a job, it will probably mean lots of
coaching and no playing.
