Delta Chi Threat
By virtue of consistent turnouts,
Delta Chi promises to be an addi

an excellent showing in the cross

country event and promises to make 1
a strong bid for the track champion- s
ship. t
Breakers and El Toro are the
strongest contenders from the halls 1
with the former having a slight ad- j
vantage. A large number of frosh r
track aspirants are expected to turn (
out from Encina Hall which has 1
been divided into several competi- i
tive groups. In this meet freshmen c
will be given the opportunity of (
showing their skill in real competi- i
tion and Coach Bill Ellington hopes i
to discover some new material. t
