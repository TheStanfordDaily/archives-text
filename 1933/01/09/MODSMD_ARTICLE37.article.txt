This is the first of a series of five artieles on the reeent JoiuitJimi Ihiller
report.—lid it nr.

Culminating the work of fifteen
months of investigating conditions
within the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Athletic Conference, Jonathan
A. Butler's 48-page booklet fell
among ten Pacific Coast Conference
schools last Thursday, and although
it failed to create the much-expected
explosion, it did contain much valu
able information.
Butler was imported from the Big
Ten in 1931 by members of the Con
ference to thoroughly look into ath
letic matters within the league. Dur
ing his term of employment, he
worked on the basis that an institu
tion should be graded or rated in
accordance with the rules of the
Conference and not by what he him
self believed should be the ideal
athletic standards.
Comments Impersonal
In his report all comments were
made as impersonal as possible and
no attempt was made to defame any
athlete. Butler received reports of
many alleged irregularities and in
vestigated each. Prejudices were al
lowed to play as little part as pos
sible in carrying on the investiga
tion.
Letters were sent to all of the
high-school principals and college
presidents in the states in which the
member universities of the Confer
ence are located. Contained in the
letter was a copy of the Conference
rulings and also a request for co
operation in the matter of knowledge
of violation of the laws. Only a small
percentage of those answering gave
information of seeming violations of
the conference code.
Progress Made
Many of the high-school and col
lege officials were personally inter
viewed by Butler and all seemed to
be of the opinion that the Confer
ence had made progress within the
past year in its efforts to curb

illegitimate practices.
Butler believes that the policy of
allowing the high-school principals
to assist with the problems of the
Conference Is far-reaching in its ef
fect and has been valuable to the
Association, not only acquainting
these men with the league standards,
but also in giving them an oppor
tunity to co-operate in a quiet man
ner wit ha program in which they
arc greatly interested.
Butler's investigation into the al
leged irregularities concerning ad
mission requirements and their en
forcement at and by the schools of
the conference as well as the records
of the athletes failed tq disclose any
thing of a startling nature.
