# COLBOURNE TO TALK ON SHAW
## 
### 
"George Bernard Shawâ€”the Plus
| and Minus Quantities of 'Too True
i To Be Good' " will be the subject of
j a lecture at 4:15 o'clock this after
noon in the Little Theatre by Mau
| l ice Colbourne, English actoi\ au
thor, and producer, who imperson
! ates Shaw in the current San Fran-
I cisco production of this famous play.
Colbourne's interest extends be
! yond literature, and the stage, how-
I ever. He is a student of social prob
lems and author of a book called
'Unemployment or War?" While
| trouping across Canada and down
| into the United States, Colbourne
j has been observing the effect of the
! current economic conditions. While
j in San Francisco he has addressed
! several groups upon this situation.
"Too True To Be Good," Shaw's
I latest and most widely talked-of
| comedy, received its premiere pro
j duction at the hands of the New
j York Theatre Guild last season. In
| ihe cast were Beatrice Lillie, well
j known English musical comedy star,
j and Hope Williams, social registerite
J and Broadway actress, who first
arose to fame in "Paris Bound" and
"Holiday."
Author, as well, of a book on
j "G. 8.5.,, who assisted in correction
j of its proofs, Colbourne has a ver
! sion of the play modified by Shaw
himself, from that used in New
| York.
Colbourne will concern himself in
the lecture with the play itself, its
I place in Shaw's work, and the vari
-1 ous criticisms of it which have been
! written heatedly since the play's first
production.
This afternoon's lecture is being
| sponsored by the English Club.
