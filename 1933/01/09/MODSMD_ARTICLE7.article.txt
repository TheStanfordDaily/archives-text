Varsity debaters meet tomorrow

To start the season they have the
much-prepared-for motion picture

varsity will face the cameras and
an audience of notables 011 Febru

Joffre Debate Set
The Joffre debate against the Uni
versity of California, with the
awarding of the historic Joffre
medal which has yearly been the
reward of the winners of this tra
ditional debate since the founding of
Stanford, will take place during the
second week of April. The team is
as yet unselected.
Varsity arguers will face teams
from the University of Washington,
Fresno State College, Whittier Col
lege, and the University of Oregon
also. Sides for these verbal battles
have not been assigned, but the
topic for discussion will be, "Re
solved: That inter-Allied war debts
should be cancelled."
Plan Radiot Debate
Hoping to repeat the successful
transcontinental radio debate held
last year with Harvard University
Coach Chapin is writing to make
arrangements with Harvard's debate
coaches and with the National
Broadcasting Company.
Two tours, the Texas-Midwest trip
from February 20 to March 1, and
the Northern tour during spring va
cation, will take the varsity team
stars traveling to most of the col
leges in the western part of the
United States.
