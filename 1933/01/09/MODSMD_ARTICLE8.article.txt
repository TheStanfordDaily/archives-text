Speaking before an enthusiastic
audience, Benjamin H. Lehman,
University of California professor,
compared modern autobiographies in
the first of his three lectures before
the American Association of Uni
versity Women in Palo Alto last
Thursday. Lehman is considered one
of the foremost scholars in the West
of modern literature. His lecture
was largely on California authors.
"Lincoln Steffens' famous autobio
graphy and Mary Austin's 'Earth
Horizons' show the American pat
tern of life," he said. Jeffers, the
Carmel poet, he named as the fore
most poet of present times, stating
that university students in France
and England write their theses on
his works.
Lehman will speak in Palo Alto
again on the first Thursday of next
month.
