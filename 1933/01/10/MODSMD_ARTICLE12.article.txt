# Veteran Janitor Recalls Student "Bert" Hoover
## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
Forty-one years at Encina is the
record of Bunsuku "Harry" Sato
mura, premier janitor of the hall and
a man whose memory includes per
sonal recollections of two presidents
of the United States, Benjamin Har
rison and Herbert Hoover, ten gen
erations of Stanford students, and
scores of persons prominent in the
early history of the University.
Since the spring of 1892 he has
made orderly the halls of Encina,
and cleaned its courts of the rubbish
tossed by residents. Coming to San
Francisco from his native Japan
when he was a boy of IH, he entered
the service of Senator Stanford as a
houschoy in th«» mansion on Nob

Hill. Shortly before the Senator's
death he was transferred to Encina.
Stanford men are "very good and
very nice," Harry says. He doesn't
think they have changed much since
the University opened, but they are
now less prone to throw papers,
bottles, old boxes, water bags, and
furniture from Encina windows.
Many times Harry has greeted
alumni he knew as students return
ing to visit their freshman sons in
Encina.
A familiar figure to campus resi
dents, Harry daily peddles his bi
cycle between Encina, the post office,
and his room in the basement of
Sequoia, proudly wears a block "S"
watch fob.
