# 'TINY' WAITS AS BOARD DELAYS REGULAR MEET
## Trustees' Date Uncertain; Thornhill Talks With Conservative Air 
### Bob Letts 
The official appointment of C. E.
"Tiny" Thornhill as Director of
Football here will probably be de
layed a week or two, it was indi
cated when Dr. Robert E. Swain,
acting president of the University,
announced that next Thursday's
scheduled meeting of the Board of
Trustees "is likely to be postponed."
No reason was given.
Dr. Swain said that the session
probably would be held on either
the following Thursday or the week
after that.
Meanwhile, Thornhill is acting
conservatively, making plans and
announcing some of them, but keep
ing most of his fire well smothered
until such time as he has signed a
contract. He made his first speech
since breaking into the news last
Thursday night at a luncheon meet
ing yesterday in Oakland, where
Stanford alumni members of that
city gathered to hear what the new
coach (technically speaking) had to
offer. Another is on the calendar
for next week at a place to be des
ignated later. Thursday or Friday
of this week, he will be radioed with
Bill Corbus, Stanford ail-American
guard, who will conclude his var
sity career under* "Tiny" next sea
son.
"Tiny" Watches Words
Through it all, the good-natured
big fellow has been trying to main
tain a certain amount of silence,
since he does not consider it wise
to make too many rash statements
until he has been officially ap
pointed.
In most of his interviews since his
recommendation was made at last
Thursday's Board of Athletic Con
trol meeting, "Tiny" has generally
prefaced his interviews with, "Well,
you know, I'm still not the head
coach, and I don't want to say too
much."
Then he gives seme indications of
what he WOULD do, providing Dr.
Swain and the trustees agree on
him. Dr. Swain would give no hint
of his intended actions, preferring
to remain silent until the trustees'
meeting. It is thought, however, that
he and the board will both approve
the B.A.C.'s actions, as it has done
in most former occasions.
Week-end Developments
Thornhill could not be i"eached at
his home last evening, but the fol
lowing developments have occurred
over the week-end:
1. Next season will see the return,
in part at least, of the single wing
back.. More power will be derived
from this formation, but it will not
present all the variations of the typ
ical Warner double - wing setup.
Both will be used, however, with
emphasis on the present system.
2. The end coach possibilities have
simmered down to Jim Lawson, Ted
Shipkej' and "Spud" Harder, all for
mer Cardinals. Shipkey is thought
by some to have the edge. He has
oeen coaching the University of Ari
zona eleven at Tempe, and is hot
ifter the job.
3. The name of Dudley S. De-
Glroot, former captain and all-star
center here, has again bobbed up, ;
!his time as a possible head fresh- j
nan coach. DeGroot took over the
3an Jose State College eleven last I
'all and brought the Spartans from
he Far Eastern Conference cellar j
:c a championship in one season. |
-le has plenty on the ball.
Dismissals Unlikely
4. It is not likely that any of the I
present staff will be dropped. How
ever, (here is the vacancy in the j
lead frosh coach's job being left I
iy "Chuck" Winterburn's intended i
ransfer to Temple University, War
ner's new school.
5. Warner will leave near the end >
j{ the month to attend a writers' [
neeting in the East and to close re- 1
naining details of his contract and )
)ther things. The time and dura- |
ion of spring football practice at
remple will be decided then. War- j
ler naturally wants more than their j
lsual two weeks, as he has to insti- j
ute his system before next autumn, i
6. Thornhill's home has been |
looded with messages of congratu- ;
atiori. His popularity has exceeded
