# Card Savants Disagree On Technocracy
## 
### 
j Technocracy, originally advanced
j by a group of Columbia scientists,
I has excited nation-wide interest. The
I Daily here offers the opinions of
' representative faculty members and
! graduate students.
ROBINSON, Citizenship: "It is not
| important that Technocracy has not
! been clearly defined. We need to
' thing, and fighting about Techno
; cracy makes fo»- thought. Let's have
| more of it."
WIIITAKER, Economics: 'The
; substitution of a unit of power for a
I unit of money is a fantastic propo
sition. I can see nothing in the pro
j posal."
BELL, Citizenship: "The funda
mental idea behind the whole move
ment is valid and significant. The
problem is one to which we will
have to give considerable thought in
j the next few years."
TURRENTINE, Law: "The adop
; tion of a constant, exactly defined
j unit representing, for instance, en
| ergy content, would not aid ex
| change of goods or services. Desire
! arises from many other considera
i tions than the measurable qualities
j of the goods."
SCORAH, Mechanical Engineer
i ing: "Technocracy looks rationally
lat the whole problem of getting a
! synchronized economic life. The peo
ple who are prcprosing it are making
j a good effort but their initial as
j sumptions seem to demand further
i analysis."
lIOLDEN, Graduate School of
! Business: "The present depression is
j not due to technological causes. The
| Frankenstein monster has had its
! counterpart in every depression since
j 1837. Present non-adjustments and
j dis-location are not chargeable to
j the fact that technology is moving
j too rapidly, but to failure of eco-
I nomic, political, and social life to
! keep pace."
MISS MacGREGOR. Public Speak
i ing: "This new school of thought has
| aroused my interest. I think that the
: quick spread of the word, tech
i nocracy, is as a whole surprising."
TERMAN, Electrical Engineering:
"Although I have read articles which
are supposed to explain technocracy,
I know less about the subject when
I am through reading."
MARTIN, Classical Literature: "I
j have read all the articles on the sub
ject that I can find, and about two
hundred newspaper clippings. I am
about as confused as the clippings."
CLOKIE, Political Science: "Any
scheme for social organization must
have an objective. The technocrat
provides the means. Technocracy is
our servant and not an end in itself,
i The five-year-plan in Russia is tech
! nocracy pure and simple. The effi
ciency expert in this country is the
technocrat."
CULVER, Research Assistant, In
dependent Study: "Technocracy's
i approach to the problems of our eco
nomic and social life is basically
j sound. Its worth will be its contri
bution to a better society."
LANCASTER, Graduate School of
Engineering: "Technocracy repre
sents an admirable theory, but as
an immediate benefit to society, it
won't work. The ideas deserve much
attention but to set up such a new
system of government would take
many centuries."

LANCASTER, Graduate School of

many centuries."
