# Paid Football Survey Brings Diverse Views
## Proposal of Bill Corbus to Subsidize Collegiate Athletes Causes Intense Discussion; Al Masters Sees No Improvement in View 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
Should Stanford compensate! her varsity griddcrs witii free hoard, room,
and tuition?
Bill Corbus, all-American guard and A.S.S.U. president, thinks it's a
good idea. "In fact," says Corbus, "extend this to all varsity athletes in
so far as it is financially possible to do so."
"Theoretically, Bill's idea is fine, but I'm afraid it wouldn't work out,"
AI Masters, graduate manager, stated. "The universities aren't living up
to conference rules now. so how can we expect them to do better under
the proposed system? With the alumni on hand to offer unofficial subsidies

''as they are today, the players would
be getting salaries in addition to ac
tual necessities."
"IS it a good idea?" replied Bill
Bates, who knows how to handle the
old pigskin himself. "It's the only
square thing to do. It's a handicap
for Stanford, because other schools
have already begun to do the same
thing."
But Ernie Caddel differs: "It will
not conquer the evil it is supposed
to be striking at, because the alumni
will still give money freely and
make the bidding even higher than
I ever."
Thornhill Looks Ahead
"Tiny" Thornhill, the man who
ought to know something about the
subject, takes a moderate stand. "I
think that Corbus* plan will come
! some day, but it is a little prema
ture just now, although some of the
Eastern colleges have been doing
something of the sort for years. Last
year we had three or four men who
lived on one meal a day, the dinner
they got at the training table."
"Where are you going to stop this
sort of thing, once you get started?
If you extend tuition, board, and
room scholarships to the football
squad, the track men would demand
the same treatment â€”likewise the
baseball, basketball, and other sport
teams." This w?s from "Dink" Tem
pleton, who added the light remark
that "pretty soon no one would be
paying to go to college."
"Pay All Athletes"
"Red" Gribben, husky tackle, add
ed: "If they're going to pay football
players, why not pay all athletes? It
will be a question of which univer
sity can bid the highest under this
plan, and no present evils will be
cured."
After all, college is a placb where
one comes to get an education, ac
cording to Gordy Campbell, varsity
quarterback of last season. Campbell
opposed the idea on the grounds that
it would place too much stress on
athletics.
"(live Scholarships"
"Other students will not be dis
criminated against," said Corbus.
Scholarships are already given for
other interests, such as excelling in
grades, music, art, and so forth. If
this is so, why shouldn't those who
excel in athletics, provided that they
keep up their scholastic standing, be
granted scholarships?"
Anyway, the question is still be
fore the house. And no official ac
tion appears to be forthcoming in the
immediate future here.
