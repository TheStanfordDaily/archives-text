# Branner Club Will Hold Informal On January 27
## 
### 
Plans for the annual Branner
Winter Informal to be held in Bran
ner Hall on Friday evening, January
27, were announced last night by
James Algar, dance chairman.
Preparations for the affair already
have been begun by Algar and his
committee. An orchestra is yet to be
chosen, but will be announced with
in the next few days.
Pastel shades will predominate in
the lighting effects and decorations,
according to Algar, who handled the
decorations for last year's Branner
Informal and also for the Branner
Night Club dance which scored such
a hit in the spring.
Members of the dance committee
include Jack Hansen, Will Eisner,
Marc Krupp, George Irvine, Jim
Blazer, and Algar.
In the last four years, 1,500,000
fans have paid their way into the
Olympic stadium to watch the U.S.C.
Trojans perform.
