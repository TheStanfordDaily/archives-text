# AN OPEN LETTER TO THE MEN OF '36

Il's ;i hell of ;i lot of fun, this experience of being rushed.
Xolhing is more inflating to (lie ego. And regardless of
what you say, having your ego inflated is pleasant.
The mistake that you freshmen will undoubtedly make
is one that freshmen have been making for years, and will
probably go on making in spite of advice such as this. That
is in worrying so much about how well you are selling
yourself to the fraternities that you forget that the fra
ternities are trying to sell themselves to you. Is your tie
straight? What ought you to talk about? Wonder how the
boys liked that last gag, or is the next one going to go over?
A mind cluttered with such thoughts is hardly in a condi
tion to judge men, to discern the real worth of one group
as opposed to another.
Then, too, some of you will lake the whole business too
seriously. You'll fret if you aren't bid by the fraternity
upon which you had set your heart. Perhaps, if none of
Ihe Creeks offer you the brass, you'll even go so far as to
decide thai life is no longer worth living.
Thai, freshmen, is a lot of bunk. Just in case you didn't
realize it, there are a plenty of smart men on this campus
who actually chose to live in a hall, rather than in a fra
ternity. And there are a lot more now living on the row
who wish to heaven that they had never pledged.
11 looks like mighty big stuff to you now, perhaps. Hut
if you'll only realize that, with all the trimmings gone, it's
not the reputation of the national fraternity that counts;
il's not Ihe big shots the house holds, nor the high-powered
roadsters Ihe fellows sport then you're getting down to
brass lacks, and to a sensible perspective from which you
can decide whether the characters, the personalities of the
individual men in this group, or that one, are those of men
you'd genuinely enjoy living with for three long years.
