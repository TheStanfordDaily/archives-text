# AS MR. CORBUS SUGGESTS-
## 
### 
Well, why not ? Why not give varsity football men their
tuition and hoard and room, as Rill Corbus, Stanford's
All-American student body president, suggests? Certainly
that would be a more tangible reward for their services
than the sweater and block letter, and the occasional ir
repressible offerings of enthusiastic alumni.
There is a great deal of merit in Corbus' suggestion.
Almost anyone acquainted with the inner picture of univer
sity life is aware of the towering Physical Education struc
ture which is built upon the jerseved, padded shoulders
of the varsity football man. Sports pages constantly explain
gridiron victories and defeats with the term "man power."
What of the individual players who determine that factor
on every team? Are they getting ail the consideration which
they deserve? Yes and more, many football fans, heads
full of subsidization propaganda, will tell you. Rut those
of us who know the players, not as pictures on the sports
pages, but as real fellows in our classes, balls, or frater
nity houses, aren't so sure.
As for dealing with varsity athletes in the manner Cor
bus suggests, Southern California is employing the plan,
we note in the Butler report to the Pacific Coast Conference,
and the Trojans have certainly not wandered beyond the
pale of Conference ethics and etiquette. Why not such
an arrangement here at Stanford, or throughout the Coast
Conference, for that matter?
The Dau.y is inclined to agree with the proposition,
with one reservation. Room and board should only be pro
vided during the autumn quarter, under such a scheme.
That is the quarter when the burdens to which Corbus
reters bear heaviest upon the football player, and there is
not much excuse for lodging and feeding him during other
quarters, when he has an opportunity equal to that of other
college students to earn his campus living expenses.
