A gold god to millions and a piti- '
ful scarecrow to hundreds, Calvin
Coolidge of White House fame
slipped by while we were occupied
in a study of tho Blundering Book
store. No one's death, within our
memory, with tna exception of Ru
dolph Valentino, Knute Rockne, and
Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. has
received more notoriety and space
in the public prints.
Practically every national figure
strained his adjectives in a great
endeavor to throw some heroic com
pliment at the thin-lipped deity of
golden prosperity. Newspaper pub
lishers lashed their editorial writers
into frenzies in the possible hope of
producing a fitting masterpiece for
the political Hercules who had
passed from our midst.
Coolidge has gone and his going is
heralded as the passing of a super
man. To attribute to him the genius
of Hamilton—the warmth of Jeffer
son—the leadership of Washington—
and the famous "touch" of Midas, is
a tawdry list of virtues, indeed,
compared to (he columns and col
umns of heroisms that have been
poured over and about his simple
grave, in the simple Vermont hills.
Coolidge never began to be any
of these things—assuming the un
likely that he really knew what they
meant. He was a simple man. That
was his boast. That was his wish. He
would consider it a fitting headstone
to his reputation. He would not con

' sider it a defamation of the dead by
one whit.
And now when high intelligence
and keen understanding are selling
high because of an under-supply and
an over-demand, is no time to begin
to worship simplicity. Simpleness
may be virtue in your ribbon clerk
or iceman. But it i.s a major tragedy
in the Presidency. And Coolidge only
averted complete disaster and hope
less defeat by one year.
If the panic had broken in 1928
instead of 1929. the holy myth of
the great god Cal would have been i
smithereened upon the ragged rocks !
of economic reality. Faced with what
faced Hoover, poor Cal would have
been floored before the "counting"
began. He wouldn't know how \o
issue statements about the depres
sion; and for attempting some con- j
structing improvements, it would, al- :
ways have been beyond him like the
horizon.
It is always desirable to view the j
living with an unprejudiced eye. It ■
is an absolute necessity to do this
for the dead. By the obvious process :
of simple association, Coolidge and i
1928 prosperity are about to go down [
in history in a blaze of golden glory, i
With equal simplicity some will seek
to damn Hoover with the depression. ;
Both associations are unfair.
From the Vermont hills he came— |
simple, and average. To the Vermont 1
hills he returns —simple and aver
age. No more. —Abe Mellinkoff

simple, and average. To the Vermont 1
hills he returns —simple and aver
age. No more. —Abe Mellinkoff
A gold god to millions and a piti- '
ful scarecrow to hundreds, Calvin
Coolidge of White House fame
slipped by while we were occupied
in a study of tho Blundering Book
store. No one's death, within our
memory, with tna exception of Ru
dolph Valentino, Knute Rockne, and
Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. has
received more notoriety and space
in the public prints.
Practically every national figure
strained his adjectives in a great
endeavor to throw some heroic com
pliment at the thin-lipped deity of
golden prosperity. Newspaper pub
lishers lashed their editorial writers
into frenzies in the possible hope of
producing a fitting masterpiece for
the political Hercules who had
passed from our midst.
Coolidge has gone and his going is
heralded as the passing of a super
man. To attribute to him the genius
of Hamilton—the warmth of Jeffer
son—the leadership of Washington—
and the famous "touch" of Midas, is
a tawdry list of virtues, indeed,
compared to (he columns and col
umns of heroisms that have been
poured over and about his simple
grave, in the simple Vermont hills.
Coolidge never began to be any
of these things—assuming the un
likely that he really knew what they
meant. He was a simple man. That
was his boast. That was his wish. He
would consider it a fitting headstone
to his reputation. He would not con

' sider it a defamation of the dead by
one whit.
And now when high intelligence
and keen understanding are selling
high because of an under-supply and
an over-demand, is no time to begin
to worship simplicity. Simpleness
may be virtue in your ribbon clerk
or iceman. But it i.s a major tragedy
in the Presidency. And Coolidge only
averted complete disaster and hope
less defeat by one year.
If the panic had broken in 1928
instead of 1929. the holy myth of
the great god Cal would have been i
smithereened upon the ragged rocks !
of economic reality. Faced with what
faced Hoover, poor Cal would have
been floored before the "counting"
began. He wouldn't know how \o
issue statements about the depres
sion; and for attempting some con- j
structing improvements, it would, al- :
ways have been beyond him like the
horizon.
It is always desirable to view the j
living with an unprejudiced eye. It ■
is an absolute necessity to do this
for the dead. By the obvious process :
of simple association, Coolidge and i
1928 prosperity are about to go down [
in history in a blaze of golden glory, i
With equal simplicity some will seek
to damn Hoover with the depression. ;
Both associations are unfair.
