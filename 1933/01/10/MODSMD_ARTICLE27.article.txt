A FAREWELL TO ARMS—(Para
mount) —At the Stanford Theatre.
If not a fine pietui'e, "A Farewell
to Arms" is a good and affecting one.
Despite the fact that it is episodic,
following the novel form rather than
the dramatic one; despite the fact
that its central situation is senti
mental rather than tragic and its
plot workings consequently melo
dramatic; despite the fact that the
heroine dies at the end, not tragical
ly, but through the unfair and in
sidious workings of coincidence; de
spite some commonplace photogra
phy «nd direction along with a con
siderable amount more of fine direc
tion and excellent photographic art
work, well suited to the idyllic por
tions of the script; despite ' these
things, "A Farewell to Arms" is a

j good film.
j Its chief attributes are perform
ances by Helen Hayes, Adolphe
j Menjou, Gary Cooper, and a sincere
j and earnest supporting cast. Wooden
| —or taciturnly masculine—as his
| performance is, his deficiencies of
; warmth noticeable more in the last,
! heart-broken lines, Cooper's playing
; is appropriate and satisfactory.
Helen Hayes, a mistress of the
successive smile and tear, is charm
ing and pathetic as Catherine. Her
performance is exquisitely varied
and intensely poignant. Adolphe
Menjou, when he escapes from the
penthouse bedroom, has shown (The
Front Page) that he can be more
than a typed suave menace. As Ri
naldi he has further opportunity to
act, and his his performance is fine.
