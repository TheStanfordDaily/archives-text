LOOKING BACK over his re
rent barnstorming trip with
members of the varsity basket
ball team, Coach John Bunn
points out that sportsmanship in
the Itocky Mountain and Mis
souri Valley states far outdoes
the average on the Pacific Coast.
"I never saw such courteous
crowds," Bunii said. "They were
almost impartial in some parts
and a good play by a Stanford
man invariably got a hand. I
wish more of that type of gallery
watched games in California."
The Card coach sees an entirely
fferent trend in basketball working
; way toward the Coast. Some of
has already reached here through
e barnstorming tours of the Wichi-
Henrys and Cook Painters, Ama
ur Athletic Union champions in
cent years.
The game, as played in the na-
Hial tournaments at Kansas City,
one featured by tall men, who take
Ivan!age of shorter opponents by
pping the casaba from one man to
lot her wit ho u: bothering to catch
While all of the teams are not
pable of doing this, those who have
tained a high polish through long
sars of playing together with the
me members have used the "slick
stuff" to a good end. •
According <o Bunn, the fastest
basketball in the country is
played in Utah. Highly special
ized offenses and poor defensive
tactics tend toward big scores,
and it is seldom that a cham
pionship quintet does not near or
surpass 50 points in a game.
Incidentally, Stanford split a
series with Utah and ran up its
highest score of the trip, 11
points, to Utah's 37.
MORE RUMBLINGS . . . the
conference season opens for
Stanford next week-end . . .
against U.S.C. . . . Los Angeles
. . . oiny . . . Cordry and Top
ping might surprise the Trojans
once . . . Hal Edclen is due to
find his eye . . . his floorwork
looks improved over last season
. . . the most improved man on
the team is Jay Tod, guard, who
has been a terror on defense . . .
he should shoot more, some
times . . . John (Declaration of
Independence) Hancock makes a
swell running mate for Tod . . .
he can hit 'em from the floor . . .
Less fouling would greatly aid
anford . . .
Harry Wolter has a big turnout
>r baseball . . . some think a cham- !
onship is around the corner . . . j
'0 early to say.
At the end of the recent barn
orming trip, the Stanford basket
en picked an all-opponent team,
hich is:
Lefferdink (Colorado). .forward
Witte (Wyoming) forward
Johnson (Kansas) center
Shaake (Kansas) guard
Harrington (Kansas) guard
Three Kansas boys, you'll notice,
id Coach "Phog" Allen of the Jay
twkers told his former pupil and
•isistant, Bunn, that the Stanford
ve was the better team, so far as
indamentals went. —B.L.
