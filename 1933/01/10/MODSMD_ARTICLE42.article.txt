SEATTLE, Jan. 8 (PlP)â€”Under
graduates at the University of Wash
ington will not "roll out" in such
large numbers as formerly under a
new system of a more liberal con
sideration of the records of students
with a failing grade average, it was
revealed by Dean Dudley D. Griffith
of the arts and sciences faculty.
Under the old system students
with a grade average of 1.5 for any
quarter were automatically dropped;
but now individual consideration
will be given to each student and
his total record will be considered
before expulsion. "The usual list of
500 students dropped will be greatly
reduced," stated Dean Griffith.
