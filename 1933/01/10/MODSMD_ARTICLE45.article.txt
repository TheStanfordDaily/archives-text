# ELIGIBILITY RULES SIMILAR EVERYWHERE, BUTLER FINDS

While the grading systems and
minimum requirements of progress
toward graduation in the different
universities in the Conference are
not alike, they are similar in many
respects and have more points in
common than have the different re
quirements for college entrance.
In most of the member universi
ties a student on probation is ineli
gible, under local university regula
tions, to take part in an extra-cur
ricular activity. An exception, how
ever, is sometimes made in the case
of intercollegiate athletics, since the
Pacific Coast Conference require
ments are lower than the local uni
versity standards in this respect.
As a result of the conference
standards of eligibility, an athlete is
able to represent a university for
four years and yet have made less
than two years' progress toward
graduation from college, having been
dropped from college or having of
his own volition remained out.
Nearly all of the member univer
sities offer some programs of work
which athletes can pass to'the ex
tent of meeting Conference eligibility
requirements. Also the rules allow
a course to be dropped near the end
of the term without penalty.
At the University of California
and U.C.L.A. a student is placed on

warning whose record at the close
of either semester shows slightly
better than a "D" average. He is
placed on probation if while on
warning he fails to maintain at least
a "C" average, and if while on pro
bation he falls below a "C" average,
he is dropped.
At U.S.C. a student whose average
for the semester falls below "C"is
placed on probation and is not re
leased until he presents a full se
mester's work, a minimum of ten
units, with a "C" average or better.
If he drops below "D" while on pro
bation or fails within three semes
ters to make a "C" average, he is
dropped from the university.
