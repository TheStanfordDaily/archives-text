# SEAVER, HAWLEY LOST TO GOLFERS
## 
### 
At least two members of Eddie
Twiggs' first-string varsity golf
squad will not be back at school this
quarter.
Charlie Seaver, number one man,
and Stew Hawley, number three,
have not signed up and have an
nounced that they are not going to.
Yet Twiggs still predicts a crack
team, and probably a championship
team. He's still confident that the
Card stick-swingers will take Cal
easily.
The top men on the varsity ladder
v/ill probably include Hai'ry Eichel
berger, Lawson Little, Gene Brown,
Tom Dwyer, and Dick Giddings.
Sandy Thompson, star golfer a
year ago, has returned to form and
yesterday turned in a qualifying
round of 78. Brown turned in a
qualifying round of 154, Dwyer
chalked up a 159, and Giddings tal
lied 161. Bill Hoelle played 18 holes
for 82.
On the frosh squad, Bud Kulinski,
number two man, will not be back
for winter quarter matches, and Bob
McGlashen is going to San Mateo
J.C. Don Edwards shot a qualifying
round of 79.
Varsity and frosh squads each
number 26 men.
The "best golf team we ever had"
has been seriously cut into by the
absent list, but even now Twiggs
predicts a championship season.
