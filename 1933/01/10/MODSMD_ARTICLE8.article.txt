## 
### 
Music, movies, McKee and Murray
Draper will*attack and attract the
eyes and ears of freshmen who at
tend the all-Hall smoker at 8:30
o'clock this evening in the lobby of
Toyon Hall. Students who live in
Palo Alto as well as the inhabitants
| of Encina, Branner, Toyon, and Se
quoia Halls may all partake of the
free cigarettes, entertainment, and
refreshments.
The music will be furnished by
the Royal Cardinals, who will have
both an orchestra and a trio present
to soothe the ears molested by
cheers led by George McKee. Mc-
Kee was the Stanford yell-leader in
1930-31, and he will sing as well as
lead yells tonight.
Football pictures that have been
characterized by Pop Warner as the
best he has ever seen will be shown.
These movies include shots of the
Big Game and the U.S.C. fracas, and
have been streamed at the screen
i but once before.
Draper, who is the speaker of the
| evening, was Stanford student body
president in 1927-28, and is now
practicing law in San Francisco. An
athlete as well as a student leader,
Draper has not announced the sub
ject of his talk but has promised
something entertainingly novel.
Art Azevedo and Herb Sanderson,
who are in charge of the smoker,
have arranged for hot dogs, coffee,
and doughnuts to refresh the hungry
and thirsty.
