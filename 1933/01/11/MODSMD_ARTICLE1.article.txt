# B.A.G. ECONOMY MOVE INVOLVES SALARY SLASH
## Football Receipts Decline Necessitates Cutting Of Budget $10,000 DEFICIT SEEN Winter And Spring Sports Programs Will Not Be Affected 
### 
Taking.the first definite steps in
an economy program made neces- j
sary by a drop in football receipts
last quarter, the Board of Athletic
Control yesterday gave notice to all
of its employees that their salaries :
will be cut not less than ten per !
cent, effective March 1. The reduc
tions will continue in effect until I
August 31, the end of the fiscal |
year, when readjustments may be I
made upon granting the regular
year-to-year agreements which
B.A.C. employees are carried.
Income Smaller
The move, made necessary because j
income for the year will be approxi- j
mately $32,000 .short of the expected j
figure, will save the board about
$13,000, A1 Masters, manager of the
8.A.C., declaimed yesterday.
The saving will come not only i
through the ten per cent cut, but
also from elimination of several ;
minor jobs of the manual labor va- |
riety at the golf course and else
where.
Deficit Anticipated
At the end of the fiscal year, Mas- i
ters pointed out, the net operating
deficit of the Board will be in the
vicinity of $10,000. This is consider- J
ably below the deficit shown when
the year began.
The salary reductions, decided [
upon at the regular meeting of the j
Board Thursday night, will affect all j
of the coaching staffs, the office em
ployees, and grounds workers.
Schedules Maintained
Those members of the Physical |
Education department whose salaries j
are adjusted by the Board will be !
affected, while the operators of the |
Men's Health Service and the Uni- j
versity Health Service, Â£fnd those I
engaged in classroom instruction in i
hygiene and physical education, I
though the Board helps to meet their j
salaries, will not feel the cut, Dr. !
Thomas A. Stoiey Director of Phys- j
ical Education, revealed.
Through the economy of this move, ;
members of the Board indicated, the :
regular winter i nd spring programs i
of sports can be carried through, in- \
eluding the representation of Stan- i
ford at the 1.C.4-A.
