# BLUNDERING BOOKSTORE?

A*iv student of physics will tell you that where there
is smoke, there also is fire; The idea is, of course, to be
certain that any hazy substance you might sight rising into
the air is smoke, and not just a lot of steam.
The fuss about Stanford's Bookstore raised recently by
the Daily Hull Sessioner, whose views, incidentally, are
independent of the editorial policy of litis publication,
se ems suspiciously to resemble smoke.
One fact in particular is damning as il stands, alone,
without explanation. That is that the Bookstore paid out
more in salaries during the depression year of 11KV2 than it
did during the boom year of Yet while paying less
ii* salaries during the boom year, it did more actual dol
lars' worth of business.
If there is inefliciency in the operation of the Bookstore,
that inefliciency represents just so many dollars out ol
student pockets. If students are paying for inelliciencv,
they ought to know it, so they can do something about it.
And the operators of the Bookstore surely don't want to
let that one glaring, damning fact go unexplained, if there
is explanation for it.
The obvious answer is for the students, through their
Executive Committee, to appoint a body to investigate the
Bookstore. It can all be done in a pleasant manner, with
no hard feelings anywhere. And when the investigation is
complete, the students will know whether or not they are
being robbed.
If they find that they are, they can act. It they find they
are not, they can go their happy certain that Stanford
is the proud possessor of a very fine bookstore.
