# Maurice Colbourne Says G. B. Shaw Above Conceit
## 
### 
"Bernard Shaw is not conceited; I
he is above conceit."
Thus Maurice Colbourne, noted
Shavian exponent, dismissed a moot j
question relating to the dragon of |
British letters in his lecture yester- j
day afternoon. In a charming man- !
ner the speakc.' gave interesting j
sidelights on the man and the play- ;
wright that is Shaw.
G. 8.5., he said, is serious, but j
never solemn, and always carritft a J
message which he feeds his audience j
like a sugar-coated pill; and they I
eat the sugar and leave the pill.
The afternoon concluded with a I
reading from the current "Too True j
To Be Good," in which Colbourne ,
impersonates the author.
