## 
### Professor Albert Guerard 
(Editor's Note: Albert L. Guerard,
j Professor of General Literature, staff
| critic of the Nev/ York Herald-Tri
, bune, American editor of France
i Amerique, and Associate Editor of
j the Southwest Review, published his
i views on Technocracy nine years ago
!in his book, '"Beyond Hatred." He
j has written the following article for
the Daily, concerning the historical
definition and significance of the
term.

"I have little to add to what I said
of Technocracy nine years ago; nine
years before I heard the now-famous
name of Mr. Smythe I used the word
then as a common term: the thing
itself had been prophesied by Count
Henri de Saint-Simon, the Utopian
Socialist, who died in 1825. Mr.
Smythe's fundamental ideaâ€”power
as the standard of value, fractions
of energy instead of grains of gold
as units of exchange, is interesting,
possibly fanciful, certainly not the
most obvious conception of Tech
nocracy. If Etymology is a safe guide,
Technocracy means government by

technicians; which I freely translate: j
'"scientific industrial management" i ;
in the social and political domains
as well as in the economic. In the J
last century and a half, science and
industry have advanced marvelous
ly: political and business methods
lag hopelessly behind. Indeed, they ;
are unamiable and cumbrous fos
sils. We'need in the White House a
Great Engineer not committed to |
the ideologies of a bygone age." i
(The following excerpts are from ,
'Beyond Hatred"):
"Every problem that the state may ; i
have to face should ultimately be , i
reducible to scientific terms, and j
could be settled by experts through !,
the aj.plication of the proper stand- it
ards. This is not yet the case ... I
the professional mind turns unscien- i <
tifically to outworn standards, so the j
"technocracy" of which some of us i
dream threatens not to be widely \
different from mere bureaucracy, or <.
the Divine Right of Red Tape . , . \
But the tendency toward techno* , 1
racy is manifest." I;
