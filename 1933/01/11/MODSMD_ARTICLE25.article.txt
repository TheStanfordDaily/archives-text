# Ike Livermore Praises Men's Rushing Rules
## Preference Night For '36 Men Is Thursday 
### 
With men's rushing past its half
way mark, the new system in effect
for the first time with the Class of
1936 seems to be proving successful
and so far has shown no serious
defects, Ike Livermore, Interfrater
nity Council president, said in a
statement last night.
Preference night is Thursday. At
that time the regular dinner period
will be extended from 8 until 10
o'clock to permit fraternities to take
rushees to a show in Palo Alto, the
only off-campus rushing permitted
in this final period.
Livermore announces that plans
are nearly complete for pledging on
Friday except for the appointing of
the lawyer, who will probably be
J D. Campbell of Palo Alto. Camp
bell acted in this same capacity at
the pledging of the Class of 1935 at
the beginning of autumn quarter.
Fraternities will hand in the names
of men whom they desire to bid to
the lawyer between 11 and 12 o'clock
Friday morning with the freshmen
signifying their choice between 1
and 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
Pledges will be allowed to go to
their houses as often as they wish
after pledging, but the fraternity
may charge thorn only for Saturday
meals, according to the rushing
rules.
