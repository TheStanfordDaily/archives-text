# Dramatic Board Votes Abolition Of Junior Opera
## Highlight of Junior Week Definitely Abandoned for '33; Campus Dramatic Leaders Divide on Council's Decision; Ex Committee Approves 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
The Junior Opera is a thing of the past.
The colorful, highly publicized and much-abused highlight of Junior
Week will no longer offer campus composers and authors the opportunity
to see their stuff strutted about the boards in the Assembly Hall each
spring quarter. This was the gist or the musical homoshell dropped in the
lap of the Ex Committee at its meeting last night when the latter body

'approved the minutes of the meet
ing of the Dramatic Council which
voted to abolish the annual produc
tion.
Campus leaders were lined up on
opposite sides of the controversy last
night as they were informed by the
Daily of this action. Many were
vigorously in favor of retaining the
traditional affair, while an even
larger number held the opinion that
the day of campus authorship is gone
forever.
Favor Musicomcdy
Don Cameron, Chappie editor and
co-author of "Proletariat Plus" in
1931, sorry to see the last of original
dramatic writing on the campus, ad
vanced the opinion that the campus
in general could not support it today
and that consequently the produc
tion has become a dead weight in
footlight activities.
Many favored supplanting the tra
ditional 30-year-old affair with a
modern musical comedy or a Gilbert
and Sullivan opus. Marian Jones and
Mary Anita Loos were firm in this
conviction. Miss Loos said: "Some
thing in a light comedy vein should
be offered for the entertainment of
the whole student body instead of
just .the lovers of legitimate drama.
A popular musical cosiedy would
be just the thing."
Whitney Explains Action
Girvin Whitney, dramatic man
ager and member of the Council,
outlined the reasons advanced by
that body for its vigorous action.
Lack of student interest in the affair
and the fact thai it has not paid for
itself in recent years, were especially
stressed, it was revealed. Because
there are "too many things doing
during Junior Week, and the juniors
themselves haven't supported their
production," tho question was raised
as to how anybody else could be
expected to support it.
General opinion of the Council
members held that the average script
submitted did not warrant the pains
taking work of the actors and di
rectors.
Ram's Head's president, Jack Red
head, came forth to refute these
arguments last night with the state
ment that: "There is no proof to the
statement that juniors do not sup
port their Opera. They have in the
past, and have shown a great deal
of enthusiasm for the work. I think
that the production should not be
abolished but should be continued,
because it is the only chance for an
all-student piece."
A plan similar to that used on
the Concert Series this year was
proposed last night by Barbara Col
lins, who has an excellent singing
voice herself. "I see no reason why
student authorship should not be
encouraged," she stated.
"At least, we ought to give the
thing one more chance and see if
(he campus will support it before it
is definitely abandoned. Last year
the student body voted to retain the
Concert Series. Let the students
voice an opinion on this themselves.

vanced the opinion that the campus
in general could not support it today
and that consequently the produc
tion has become a dead weight in
footlight activities.
Many favored supplanting the tra
ditional 30-year-old affair with a
modern musical comedy or a Gilbert
and Sullivan opus. Marian Jones and
Mary Anita Loos were firm in this
conviction. Miss Loos said: "Some
thing in a light comedy vein should
be offered for the entertainment of
the whole student body instead of
just .the lovers of legitimate drama.
A popular musical cosiedy would
be just the thing."
Whitney Explains Action
Girvin Whitney, dramatic man
ager and member of the Council,
outlined the reasons advanced by
that body for its vigorous action.
Lack of student interest in the affair
and the fact thai it has not paid for
itself in recent years, were especially
stressed, it was revealed. Because
there are "too many things doing
during Junior Week, and the juniors
themselves haven't supported their
production," tho question was raised
as to how anybody else could be
expected to support it.
General opinion of the Council
members held that the average script
submitted did not warrant the pains
taking work of the actors and di
rectors.
Ram's Head's president, Jack Red
head, came forth to refute these
arguments last night with the state
ment that: "There is no proof to the
statement that juniors do not sup
port their Opera. They have in the
past, and have shown a great deal
of enthusiasm for the work. I think
that the production should not be
abolished but should be continued,
because it is the only chance for an
all-student piece."
A plan similar to that used on
the Concert Series this year was
proposed last night by Barbara Col
lins, who has an excellent singing
voice herself. "I see no reason why
student authorship should not be
encouraged," she stated.
"At least, we ought to give the
thing one more chance and see if
(he campus will support it before it
is definitely abandoned. Last year
the student body voted to retain the
Concert Series. Let the students
voice an opinion on this themselves.
The Junior Opera is a thing of the past.
The colorful, highly publicized and much-abused highlight of Junior
Week will no longer offer campus composers and authors the opportunity
to see their stuff strutted about the boards in the Assembly Hall each
spring quarter. This was the gist or the musical homoshell dropped in the
lap of the Ex Committee at its meeting last night when the latter body

'approved the minutes of the meet
ing of the Dramatic Council which
voted to abolish the annual produc
tion.
Campus leaders were lined up on
opposite sides of the controversy last
night as they were informed by the
Daily of this action. Many were
vigorously in favor of retaining the
traditional affair, while an even
larger number held the opinion that
the day of campus authorship is gone
forever.
