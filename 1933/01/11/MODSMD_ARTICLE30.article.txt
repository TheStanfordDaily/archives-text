# CONFIDENCE AND CONTRACTS
## 
### 
Tonight ill (i o'clock the StaiT Committee of the Hoard
of Athletic Control will discuss with Tinv ThornhilJ a
couple of important matters relative to his coaching job
here on the Farm.
First, they'll mull over the candidates for the second
assistant, Frnie Xevers having already been given the job
of chief aid, hacklield coach, or Assistant Director of Foot
hall, whichever von prefer to call it.
Then they'll get Tinv's views, and offer him theirs, on
the matter of a contract, its term of tenure, et cetera.
Regarding the first point, it is likely that the man whom
the new head coach favors will he given the job. At least
it ought to work that way, since after all Tiny is respon
sible for the calibre of the team that represents Stanford
on the gridiron next autumn. He ought to know better
than anyone else who can work best with him, and who
will give him the, sort of assistance he wants.
Then on the length-of-contract business. Tiny knows
he has the confidence of all of Stanford. Otherwise he
would not have been given the job. In all probability he
will turn out very good football teams, and will be around
here as chief for many prosperous years.
Hut the era of long-term coaching contracts is gone, just
as the days of football frenzy and huge gate receipts are
gone. In these times the gridiron sport, like any other
tremendous American industry, must retrench. And the
football coach, like the business executive, must face the
prospect- of working on a year-to-year basis.
II would be gallant as an expression of confidence to
Â£ranl Tiny a three year contract. Hut Tiny already has that
confidence. And the year-to-year arrangement is the only
sane, practical one.
