# TWO GET THE AXE

Two more items were entered on the credit side of the
present Men's Council ledger recently when two students,
both of them men, felt the keen-bladed edge of the under
graduate axe which stands guard over the Honor Code,
ruder the stern jurispridenee of the present Council, en
forcement of the Honor System has come to mean the im
partial and unrelenting administration of justice. There
is hut one loop-hole in the present treatment of Honor
Code violations—the justice so administered does not have
the opportunity to operate in more than a small fraction
of the total number of violations which occur.
The Men's Council is certainly doing its part to make
tlx* Code a realistic success on the campus. All that re
mains undone toward the realization of that success is an
awakening on the part of Stanford students that they, and
Ihev alone, are the "police" responsible for detection of the
crimes against campus society.
The argument has frequently been advanced that the
tale-telling tactics upon which Honor Code enforcement
necessarily relies is incongruous with the words "honor"
and "code," from which the system takes its name. Such,
however, is not the ethical aspect of the situation. Students
who, in their class and examination conduct, uphold the
honor tradition should realize that they are parts of the
vast majority, and that violators of the ('ode represent a
small and mean minority.
As an undesirable minority, Honor Code violators will
never be exterminated under the present operation of the
plan. The Men's Council is performing its duty well with
such cases as are brought to its attention, but the Code will
never be a complete success until there exists a student
consciousness that violators deserve a treatment harsh in
proportion to the meanness of their misdemeanors.
