# A
						STRONG DECISION
## 
### 
Faced hv the facts of reduced income from gate receipts,
the Hoard ol Athletic Control had to resort to one of two
modes of action. They could cut out several activities, such
as treshmen sports, practice shames for the varsities, and
the I.C.tA. meet, or they could reduce the salaries of all
H.A.(.. employees. They chose the latter course.
It would have been very easy for the H.A.G. to have
complained of the lack of funds and insisted on cutting out
several student activities. This could have been done so
I! *;»I the general public would never have detected the re
duced program that was offered. The only persons that
would have suffered would have been the students.
No one likes to cut salaries, and especially in these days
when everyone runs close to their budget. That the H.A.C.
considered the student needs above all else is highly com
mendable. Stanford is assured by this action of the regular
number of events and activities for the remainder of the
st hool year.
It took coinage to face the facts. It took courage to cut
salaries, t'ndergraduates may feel assured that the Hoard
is in good hands.
