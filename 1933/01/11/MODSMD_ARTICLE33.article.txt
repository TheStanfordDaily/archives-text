# BULL SESSION
## DOLLARS FOR HEROES 
### 
Whether to pay the team as they
trot out on the field; or after the day's
work is done; or at half time—will
[probably be the problem confronting
Daily editors in years to come. The
j fiction of amateur athletics seems to
| have been tried and found non
[ existant. How football heroes are
I purchased and carried through four
! years with the minimum effort and
[expense to themselves has long been
'a problem for commissions to diddle
|\vilh.
Now comes a frank, open sugges
tion to hand athletes their room,
board,.and tuition. And there seems
to be no LOGICAL reason why they
shouldn't be given clothes, a Ford
roadster, and a little spending
money. There is a financial obstacle
of course. In short, amateurism is to
be discarded in name as it has long
been in fact.
It is contended that students are
paid (in scholarships) and so why
not athletes? No one seems to re
member (and perhaps the point is a
bit obscure) that universities are
supposed to be places of study—
educational institutions. Athletics
were originally installed at a college
as a means of developing nice,
healthy, strong bodies in the stu
dents. That seems to be too old
fashioned, I suppose. And in fact,
has long since become a mere an
thropological curiosity.
If the athletes are to be paid, why
not the students? Surely they are as
much a part of this place as anyone
else. We might even scout the prep

schools for promising majors in
classical lit and zoological sciences.
A scout would telegraph in: "Doctor
Swain, have dandy 108-pound chem
ash. Runs normal equation in two
seconds." Swain would wire back:
"Buy immediately at any price."
Of course, the leal problem is that
football brings in tremendous sums
of money. And grinds don't bring in
anything. During prosperity, the
BA.C. incurred huge debts in ex
tensivfe building programs. And to
pay those debts, we need winning
teams to draw big crowds. And the
crowds bring much lucre to the
campus. And the lucre is used to
incur more debts. And forever and
ever, Stanford must have winning
teams.
Winning teams are not pulled out
of the thin air—not with other col
leges paying plenty to grab oft' po
tential ball-carriers. Stanford's grass
turf is not particularly attractive to
football players. They would rather
fall on some other college's grass—
if at that "college the force of the
i call is broken with free meals, room,
tuition, and gr?vy jobs. To meet
competition and to equalize the pro
fessionalism, it has been suggested
to make these "gifts" legal.
But as soon as these gifts are made
legal, the colleges will start slipping
the boys other monetary attractions
on the sly. There is no hope. At least
under the present system we can
maintain hypocritical self-respect
under the thing guise of technical
( amateurism. *
