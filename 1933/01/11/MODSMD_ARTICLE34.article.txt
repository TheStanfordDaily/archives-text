"NEW YORK—Strange new freight
cars to ship cold stuff 10J) degrees
below zero were described to the
American Society of Mechanical En
gineers today.'"—S.F. Examiner.
Two 'hoes once climbed a ram
bling freight
They cracked a door with ex
pert blow.
But then they met their chilly
fate
''One hundred nine degrees—
below."
On threadbare wings they
mounted high
They still were cold as hard
packed snow.
Sweet pity melted Peter's eye
He sent them down to thaw—
below.

But give me Disney's Mickey
