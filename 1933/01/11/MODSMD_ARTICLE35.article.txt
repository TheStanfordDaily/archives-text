The Editor, Sir:
In view of the facts or purported
facts cited by Mr. Mellinkoff for the
past several days concerning our
Bookstore, it would seem to some
of the less-informed students that
it might be possible that something
is decidedly wrong with that institu
tion.
Guy C. Miller, in a letter printed
in this morning's Daily, asserts that
cold figures do not reflect the poli
cies and methods underlying the
management of the Bookstore. If
something other than cold figures
can explain away the fact that the
Bookstore is now paying salaries
greater than those they paid in 1929,
as Mr. Mellinkoff claims, why does
n't someone qualified to do so come
forth with such an explanation? If
these other startling facts and fig
ures cited by Mr. Mellinkoff can be

explained away by the underlying
policies and methods of manage
ment of the Bookstore, why doesn't
someone connected with its manage
ment tell us just what these policies
and methods are?
At Stanford we ai'e so fortunate
as to have one of the. two best
graduate schools of business in this
country. This school has on its fac
ulty men of the most thorough sort
of business training; men who are
outstanding authorities. Do any of
these most eminently qualified gen
tlemen have anything to say about

I the management of the Bookstore?
If not, why not?
As we understand it, the Book
store ', a co-operative organization
since it pays (or did pay) rebates,
i However, information concerning its
operation and management appears
to be very scarce. Is it too much to
ask for a statement of its present
methods, policies, and management?
