AN ADDITIONAL NOTE ON "A
FAREWELL TO ARMS—At the
Stanford Theatre.
(This portion of the criticism of
Paramount's picture was unfortu
nately omitted from yesterday's
Daily. The earlier comments demand
some further explanation.)
As in Romeo and Juliet, tragic
tone rather than, truly tragic situa
tion makes "A Farewell to Arms"
as intense as it is. It is less effective
because thus tone or atmosphere is
less well sustained. Frederico's fool
hardy desertion does not, at once,
win sympathy, and the retreat from
Caporetto is too vague—thanks, we
are told, to protests by the Italian
government—and too lengthily so to
connect properly the pieces of the
story.
But diplomacy cannot be blamed
entirely for the abberations in at
mosphere as the final shot—a flock
! of flying pigeons against a clearing
. sky—indicates. Further, the at-times
unnecessary oddity of camera angle
is disconcerting, the extremely close
up particularly so.
Therefore, instead of being caught
up in the atmosphere and swept
along with the tale without an op
portunity to observe its deficiencies,
an audience can, and does, during
; the pauses, think, and the spell is
broken for a time. I should blame
this not on either plot or acting— 1
the first could have been utilized
more deftly and the second is al
i most unimpeachable—but upon di-
I rection which, while handling some
extremely difficult episodes \yith fine
; taste and quiet, slips upon less im
mediately important but connective
; ones.
It is, however, distinctly one of the
better films and one well worth see
! ing for its many virtues. —Sandoe
BRIDAL WISE—At the Alcazar
Theatre.
This is farce, pure and simple, but
barring a slow first act, is very well
handled. The plot is a rather con
ventional affair. A man (Tom Moore)
and a woman (Lois Wilson) divorce
and then marry Blyth Daly and Matt
; Moore, respectively. They are pre
vented by circumstances from leav
ing for their honeymoons and con

sequently make up. The chief com
plication is their son, Peter, a child
whose will has never been broken
and who succeeds in frustrating
every plan to solve difficulties. Jay
Ward, who played that part, almost
ran off with the play and was the
one saving feature of the first act.
As is frequent in farce, the com
edy arises not so much from dia
logue as situation. And the changes
o!' situation are so rapid and ridicu
lous that they sustain the play per
fectly. Whilt# the final outcome is
always evident, one never knows
what will happen next.
The play calls for no difficult act
ing, and all the roles were ade
quately handled. Turn Moore did not
overplay as much as the part de
manded, and consequently was the
weakest of th.> principals. All the
characters played their roles as if
unaware of the totally ridiculous

situation; while this course is not
usually advisable, in a play of this
sort where few attempts are made
at high comedy, this method adds to
the absurdity.
The chief weakness of the play
lies in the fact that the whole first
act is used for exposition; but in
spite of this th-> play is rapid and
excellent farce. —Zimansky

LIEBESWALZKI!—At the Filmarte

There seems to be little point in
writing separat" reviews for each
German operetta—all are alike in
plot and music, and all are fairly
enjoyable. This one falls below aver
age by failure to introduce sufficient
variety into the details, and the feel
ing that one can anticipate every
scene gives the sensation that it is
dragging horribly. Willy Fritsch and
Georg Alexander, the male leads,
were chiefly responsible for the few
good scenes. —Zimansky,
