# Frosh Quintet Expects To Stage Comeback Next Week
## FRESHMAN CAGERS LOSE TWO GAMES; STILL LOOK GOOD Don Greenlee, Ex-Glendale Prep Star, Fails To Impress Fans 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Two well-played games have re
sulted in two defeats for Stanford's
freshman basketball team, but have
thoroughly dispelled the shroud of
mystery which has clouded the I!).'J
yearling situation since practice be
gan early last fall.
Vast improvement must clearly be
effected'before the Indians can com
plete on even terms with the larger
California freshmen, but a well
rounded schedule of practice games
has been arranged, so Stanford fans
may expect their "White Hopes" to
turn in improved performances from
week to week.
Greenlee Fails
Prior to Saturday night's contest
with St. Mary.-' Don Greenlee, a
Glendale High School star, entering
Stanford for the first time this quar
ter, was hailed as the Moses who
would lead Stanford out of its (lack
of - center - material) Wilderness.
Greenlee controlled the tip-off dur
ing a portion of the first half, but
was badly outjumped during the
second period. Though badly off the
shooting form that won him All-
Southern California prep honors,
Greenlee's work was satisfactory—
not outstanding. Charles Viguie
stayed on the bench during the en
tire forty minutes <>f Monday night's
game, largely in ' order to give
Greenlee a chance to get acquainted
with the John Bunn style of play.
Viguie played vciy good basketball
on Friday.
Stanford's scoring machine is .built
around Ralph Mannion and Addie
Barnett: Mannion as the dead-eye
shot, the ultimate barrage of the
Indian attack—Barnett to work the
ball effectively down the court into
scoring position, varying these tac
tics with mad dashes the length of
the court which start under his own
goal, and end with a leaping, one
handed shot close under the oppon
ent's basket.
Brooke Busy
Don Greenlee, Wally Brooke, and
Don Maentz are far from actionless
puppets used to fill out the required
live-man lineup. Though Mannion
and Barnett have so far outclassed
their teammates, the freshman quin
tet is far from a "two-man team."
Brooke covered more court space
than the rest of the Stanford team
combined in dogging the foosteps
of St. Mary's Barsotti with feline
tenacity. Brook.' apes the play of
Tom Cordry's freshman year just as
much as does Barnett the superla
tive play of the great Vance Fawcett.
Quite a lot of roses for a team
that was defeated in the only two
games it has played.
San Francisco and St. Mary's both
brought teams to the Pavilion that
engaged in half-a-dozen prac
tice games. While Stanford's "green"
team struggled to learn the idiosyn
cracies of its own players, and act
accordingly—the Muchachos and the
Gaels passed and shot with emphatic
confidence. Both Indian opponents
had already reached mid-season
form.

sulted in two defeats for Stanford's
freshman basketball team, but have
thoroughly dispelled the shroud of
mystery which has clouded the I!).'J
yearling situation since practice be
gan early last fall.
Vast improvement must clearly be
effected'before the Indians can com
plete on even terms with the larger
California freshmen, but a well
rounded schedule of practice games
has been arranged, so Stanford fans
may expect their "White Hopes" to
turn in improved performances from
week to week.
Greenlee Fails
Prior to Saturday night's contest
with St. Mary.-' Don Greenlee, a
Glendale High School star, entering
Stanford for the first time this quar
ter, was hailed as the Moses who
would lead Stanford out of its (lack
of - center - material) Wilderness.
Greenlee controlled the tip-off dur
ing a portion of the first half, but
was badly outjumped during the
second period. Though badly off the
shooting form that won him All-
Southern California prep honors,
Greenlee's work was satisfactory—
not outstanding. Charles Viguie
stayed on the bench during the en
tire forty minutes <>f Monday night's
game, largely in ' order to give
Greenlee a chance to get acquainted
with the John Bunn style of play.
Viguie played vciy good basketball
on Friday.
Stanford's scoring machine is .built
around Ralph Mannion and Addie
Barnett: Mannion as the dead-eye
shot, the ultimate barrage of the
Indian attack—Barnett to work the
ball effectively down the court into
scoring position, varying these tac
tics with mad dashes the length of
the court which start under his own
goal, and end with a leaping, one
handed shot close under the oppon
ent's basket.
Brooke Busy
Don Greenlee, Wally Brooke, and
Don Maentz are far from actionless
puppets used to fill out the required
live-man lineup. Though Mannion
and Barnett have so far outclassed
their teammates, the freshman quin
tet is far from a "two-man team."
Brooke covered more court space
than the rest of the Stanford team
combined in dogging the foosteps
of St. Mary's Barsotti with feline
tenacity. Brook.' apes the play of
Tom Cordry's freshman year just as
much as does Barnett the superla
tive play of the great Vance Fawcett.
Quite a lot of roses for a team
that was defeated in the only two
games it has played.
San Francisco and St. Mary's both
brought teams to the Pavilion that
engaged in half-a-dozen prac
tice games. While Stanford's "green"
team struggled to learn the idiosyn
cracies of its own players, and act
accordingly—the Muchachos and the
Gaels passed and shot with emphatic
confidence. Both Indian opponents
had already reached mid-season
form.
Two well-played games have re
sulted in two defeats for Stanford's
freshman basketball team, but have
