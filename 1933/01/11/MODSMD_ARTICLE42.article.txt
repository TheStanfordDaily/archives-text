THE RE-ELECTION OF
FREDDY GLOVER to the cap
taincy of Stanford's varsity box
ing team is a tribute to the
gameness of one of the Cardi
nal's best sportsmen and one of
its outstanding athletes.
Glover was unable to compete last
year due to an injury incurred be
fore the start of the season, and yet
here he is back again, and eager to
take on the best of the college
boxers.
Aside from being one of the hard
est hitters ever to don a glove for
the Indian team, Glover is another
in that long line of Phi Beta Kappa
men who have captained Harry Ma
loney's minor sport teams. Three
years ago the soccer, boxing, and
fencing captains were all honor men.
WE MAY BE WRONG, but
we'll take a chance on what we
regard as the fact that the men
who hired Jonathan Butler to
make his report wanted the
truth about the intercollegiate
situation on the Coast, and not
necessarily a report that would
blast the lid off the world.
Butler turned in the facts as they
found them, and he even went to the
trouble of explaining why what he
had found failed to be more startling
than it was. Which certaintly ought
to satisfy those scribes who had
hoped to be able to write long and
scathing articles on the corruption
of intercollegiate athletics.
If the powers (hat be chose to
pay him $10,000 for his services,
that is their business, not a

proper worry for harrassed
sports writers.
FOR THOSE WHO ARE
SCOTCH, as well as those who
are actually broke, Mr. Ernest
Nevers is filling a limited en
gagement on the varsity football
field each afternoon until the
22d of the month. And until such
time as lie decides to have secret
practice, the mob is at liberty to
watch how professional bone
crushers are trained.
In other word's, if you still want to
see some football, go out and watch
Ernie whip his men into shape for
their game with the Green Bay
Packers, to be played in Kezar Sta
dium, Sunday, January 22.
There are plenty of stars on pa
rade, and campus fans can even
watch some one-time Trojans, with
a fair amount of pleasure.
THE HOPED-FOR OPENING of
Ihe local baseball season, which was
tentatively scheduled for this Sat
urday, has been definitely postponed
in deference to the Greeks, who will
NOT return to their little warm beds
at a reasonable hour Friday night.
Chances are extremely good that
the varsity will have a practice
game with the Kenealy Seals the
following Wednesday, however, and
from then on the team will probably
have two games a week until the
season opens in the middle of Feb
ruary. —Bob Wade

nal's best sportsmen and one of
its outstanding athletes.
Glover was unable to compete last
year due to an injury incurred be
fore the start of the season, and yet
here he is back again, and eager to
take on the best of the college
boxers.
Aside from being one of the hard
est hitters ever to don a glove for
the Indian team, Glover is another
in that long line of Phi Beta Kappa
men who have captained Harry Ma
loney's minor sport teams. Three
years ago the soccer, boxing, and
fencing captains were all honor men.
WE MAY BE WRONG, but
we'll take a chance on what we
regard as the fact that the men
who hired Jonathan Butler to
make his report wanted the
truth about the intercollegiate
situation on the Coast, and not
necessarily a report that would
blast the lid off the world.
Butler turned in the facts as they
found them, and he even went to the
trouble of explaining why what he
had found failed to be more startling
than it was. Which certaintly ought
to satisfy those scribes who had
hoped to be able to write long and
scathing articles on the corruption
of intercollegiate athletics.
If the powers (hat be chose to
pay him $10,000 for his services,
that is their business, not a

proper worry for harrassed
sports writers.
FOR THOSE WHO ARE
SCOTCH, as well as those who
are actually broke, Mr. Ernest
Nevers is filling a limited en
gagement on the varsity football
field each afternoon until the
22d of the month. And until such
time as lie decides to have secret
practice, the mob is at liberty to
watch how professional bone
crushers are trained.
In other word's, if you still want to
see some football, go out and watch
Ernie whip his men into shape for
their game with the Green Bay
Packers, to be played in Kezar Sta
dium, Sunday, January 22.
There are plenty of stars on pa
rade, and campus fans can even
watch some one-time Trojans, with
a fair amount of pleasure.
THE HOPED-FOR OPENING of
Ihe local baseball season, which was
tentatively scheduled for this Sat
urday, has been definitely postponed
in deference to the Greeks, who will
NOT return to their little warm beds
at a reasonable hour Friday night.
Chances are extremely good that
the varsity will have a practice
game with the Kenealy Seals the
following Wednesday, however, and
from then on the team will probably
have two games a week until the
season opens in the middle of Feb
ruary. —Bob Wade

FREDDY GLOVER to the cap
