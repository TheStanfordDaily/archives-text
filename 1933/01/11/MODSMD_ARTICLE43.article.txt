# RETURN OF GEORGE GRIFFIN BRIGHTENS CARD HOOP FUTURE
## Recovery Of Jack Hoerner Strengthens Chances Against U.S.C. 
### 
Hopes of the varsity basketball
team developing a presentable of
fense grew somewhat brighter yes
terday when it was revealed that
George Griffin, a squad member two
years ago, has returned to Stanford
to complete his education.
Griffin, who pldys either forward
or guard, has kept in shape during
his absence by playing in the Palo
Alto Commercial League, a local
eight-team organization. He cap
tained the league champions, and
was a steady scorer.
New to System
Although new to the system
taught by Coach John Bunn, Griffin
is expected to give the Indians ad
ditional reserve strength. He stands
5 feet 11 inches and weighs about
168 pounds.
He is being groomed to play for
ward, but will probably get in shape
to do some guard work in the ab
sence of either Jay Tod or John
Hancock.
Hoerner Back
The appearance of Griffin, coupled
with the return of Jack Hoerner,
I reserve center who was left in a
Lawrence, Kan., hospital with a bad
cold during the recent barnstorming
trip, gives the Cardinals additional
hopes of breaking even or upsetting
University of Southern California
twice when the conference opens
this week-end in Los Angeles.
Hoerner was not in uniform when
St. Mary's came down for a licking'
Monday evening, but he turned out
last night and hopes to be physically
prepared to battle the Trojans. In
case he isn't, Coach Bunn will have
the chance to try a new front-line
combination composed of Captain
Tommy Cordry and Griffin at for
wards and Keith Topping at center,
thus giving Hal Edelen, regular
pivot, a rest.
