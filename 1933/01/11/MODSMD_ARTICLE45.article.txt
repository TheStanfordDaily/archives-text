# RULES ON COACHES INTERVIEWING ATHLETES NEED REVISING-BUTLER
## 
### 
In delving into the financial 'status
of athletes representing the Pacific
Coast Conference, Mr. Butler found
that a great majority of them must
earn, or otherwise secure, all or a
major portion of the funds to meet
their college expenses. As this is a
very important factor, it can not be
disregarded when thoughtful con
sideration is given to matters per
taining to the recruiting of athletes
and their maintenance in college.
Butler also holds that this fact
emphasizes the shortcomings of the
prevailing amateur rules in meeting
general athletic conditions as they
really exist. Having known many of
the athletes personally and the ad
verse conditiops under which they
worked, he feels that he is in a
position to speak correctly.
Having no doubt but what ath
letic enthusiasts have financially as
sisted individual confei'ence athletes
ir. various ways, the investigator
also discovered that it was very dif
ficult to obtain specific proof con
cerning that exaet activities of these
alumni and other individuals.

Although these alumni told Butler
what they were doing in the way
of financial assistance to college ath
letes, they also informed him that
ii any attempt were made to involve
the young men concerned, they
would do everything in their power
to protect them.
Butler points out that because of
the high caliber of these men ->as
citizens and because they arc known
at their universities for many of
their activities, that the universities
and the conference might be able to
lessen illegitimate activities consid
erably by suggesting the definite
ways and channels through which
an alumnus or individual may le
gitimately render assistance in keep
ing within the conference rulings.
Investigator Butler states that the
recruiting of athietes is one of the
major problems of the Pacific Coast
Conference and as yet there is no
common interpretation of the pres
ent conference rules relative to the
matter.
