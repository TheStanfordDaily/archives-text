# RULES ON COACHES INTERVIEWING ATHLETES NEED REVISING-BUTLER
## 
### 
In delving into the financial 'status
of athletes representing the Pacific
Coast Conference, Mr. Butler found
that a great majority of them must
earn, or otherwise secure, all or a
major portion of the funds to meet
their college expenses. As this is a
very important factor, it can not be
disregarded when thoughtful con
sideration is given to matters per
taining to the recruiting of athletes
and their maintenance in college.
Butler also holds that this fact
emphasizes the shortcomings of the
prevailing amateur rules in meeting
general athletic conditions as they
really exist. Having known many of
the athletes personally and the ad
verse conditiops under which they
worked, he feels that he is in a
position to speak correctly.
Having no doubt but what ath
letic enthusiasts have financially as
sisted individual confei'ence athletes
ir. various ways, the investigator
also discovered that it was very dif
ficult to obtain specific proof con
cerning that exaet activities of these
alumni and other individuals.

Although these alumni told Butler
what they were doing in the way
of financial assistance to college ath
letes, they also informed him that
ii any attempt were made to involve
the young men concerned, they
would do everything in their power
to protect them.
Butler points out that because of
the high caliber of these men ->as
citizens and because they arc known
at their universities for many of
their activities, that the universities
and the conference might be able to
lessen illegitimate activities consid
erably by suggesting the definite
ways and channels through which
an alumnus or individual may le
gitimately render assistance in keep
ing within the conference rulings.
Investigator Butler states that the
recruiting of athietes is one of the
major problems of the Pacific Coast
Conference and as yet there is no
common interpretation of the pres
ent conference rules relative to the
matter.
Wide range in the cost of tuitions
and fees "at the different conference
universities also acts as a natural
barrier and disadvantage to an in
stitution with a stiff entrance pay
ment in the matter of attracting ath
letes. Eight of the members of the
conference are state-supported, hav
ing no, or very little, tuition charges,
while two of the schools have a
substantial fee for all entrants.
Some of the conference coaches
conduct considerable correspondence
with prospective athletes, wrote But
ler in his report. Many of the con
ference men maintain that the part
of the conference code which is
given below makes it impossible for
a coach to legitimately conduct so
licitous correspondence with a pro
spective athlete, even though the
correspondence may be initiated by
the athlete, himself.
"Soliciting of athletes, directly or
indirectly, by coaches, or other rep
resentatives of the athletic organiza
tions of any member of the confer T
ence is prohibited."
Others maintain that the coach is
at liberty to follow up the original
letter, in any matter he chooses,
while others insist that a coach may
even initiate correspondence with
prospective athletes without violat
ing arty of the conference code.
Particular attention is also called
to part 16 of *he conference rulings
by Butler, which is:
"Trips for the principal or inci
dental purpose of meeting or inter
viewing athletes are forbidden."
As may be easily seen, the word
ing of this sentence is such that it
readily lends itself to various in
terpretations and has caused a great
many misunderstandings especially
when athletes are introduced to a
coach during a trip which he is tak
ing for the principal purpose of
meeting alumni and friends of the

school. In a ease such as this the
meeting of the coach and the athlete
is listed as accidental or perhaps
incidental, when in reality it is prob
ably the main reason for the coach
being on the excursion.
While the conference rules restrict
coaches and university athletic of
ficials in the matter of personally
soliciting athletes, the rules do not
restrict them in getting others to
solicit for their various universities.
According to Butler, the most ef
fective recruiting of athletes today
is done in this manner and it repre
sents the crux and major trend of
the recruiting problem.

many misunderstandings especially
when athletes are introduced to a
coach during a trip which he is tak
ing for the principal purpose of
meeting alumni and friends of the

school. In a ease such as this the
meeting of the coach and the athlete
is listed as accidental or perhaps
incidental, when in reality it is prob
ably the main reason for the coach
being on the excursion.
While the conference rules restrict
coaches and university athletic of
ficials in the matter of personally
soliciting athletes, the rules do not
restrict them in getting others to
solicit for their various universities.
According to Butler, the most ef
fective recruiting of athletes today
is done in this manner and it repre
sents the crux and major trend of
the recruiting problem.
In delving into the financial 'status
of athletes representing the Pacific
Coast Conference, Mr. Butler found
that a great majority of them must
earn, or otherwise secure, all or a
major portion of the funds to meet
their college expenses. As this is a
very important factor, it can not be
disregarded when thoughtful con
sideration is given to matters per
taining to the recruiting of athletes
and their maintenance in college.
Butler also holds that this fact
emphasizes the shortcomings of the
prevailing amateur rules in meeting
general athletic conditions as they
really exist. Having known many of
the athletes personally and the ad
verse conditiops under which they
worked, he feels that he is in a
position to speak correctly.
Having no doubt but what ath
letic enthusiasts have financially as
sisted individual confei'ence athletes
ir. various ways, the investigator
also discovered that it was very dif
ficult to obtain specific proof con
cerning that exaet activities of these
alumni and other individuals.

Although these alumni told Butler
what they were doing in the way
of financial assistance to college ath
letes, they also informed him that
ii any attempt were made to involve
the young men concerned, they
would do everything in their power
to protect them.
Butler points out that because of
the high caliber of these men ->as
citizens and because they arc known
at their universities for many of
their activities, that the universities
and the conference might be able to
lessen illegitimate activities consid
erably by suggesting the definite
ways and channels through which
an alumnus or individual may le
gitimately render assistance in keep
ing within the conference rulings.
Investigator Butler states that the
recruiting of athietes is one of the
major problems of the Pacific Coast
Conference and as yet there is no
common interpretation of the pres
ent conference rules relative to the
matter.
Wide range in the cost of tuitions
and fees "at the different conference
universities also acts as a natural
barrier and disadvantage to an in
stitution with a stiff entrance pay
ment in the matter of attracting ath
letes. Eight of the members of the
conference are state-supported, hav
ing no, or very little, tuition charges,
while two of the schools have a
substantial fee for all entrants.
Some of the conference coaches
conduct considerable correspondence
with prospective athletes, wrote But
ler in his report. Many of the con
ference men maintain that the part
of the conference code which is
given below makes it impossible for
a coach to legitimately conduct so
licitous correspondence with a pro
spective athlete, even though the
correspondence may be initiated by
the athlete, himself.
"Soliciting of athletes, directly or
indirectly, by coaches, or other rep
resentatives of the athletic organiza
tions of any member of the confer T
ence is prohibited."
Others maintain that the coach is
at liberty to follow up the original
letter, in any matter he chooses,
while others insist that a coach may
even initiate correspondence with
prospective athletes without violat
ing arty of the conference code.
Particular attention is also called
to part 16 of *he conference rulings
by Butler, which is:
"Trips for the principal or inci
dental purpose of meeting or inter
viewing athletes are forbidden."
