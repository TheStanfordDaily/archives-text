# Stanford Traditions Thrive Men's 'Rough' Dress Rebuke To Women Alumni Mourn For Old Days

Graphing the curves of Stanford
traditions shows that they are not
by any means all at the end of a
downward slope, let the '19's and
the '99's lament as they will.
The Stanford Tradition of Crude
ness in Men's Dress developed long
after other customs were time-hon
ored. It so happened that men of 25
years ago had grown somewhat
careless about their toilettes. A
prominent camput woman published
a rebuke to them in the Daily one
morning. The next day what had
been an oversight became the sub
ject of artificial cultivation. That day
was called "Rough's Day." Costumes
were ingenious and elaborate. They
were not limited to faded masculine
attire but included infants' clothing
and the bouffant skirts of ballet
dancers.
Rough's Day was observed annu
ally until the abuse of those not
taking part led to its abandonment.
The spirit of the day lingersyon in

the habitual dress of the campus
rough.
When with the Class of '99 the
juniors began wearing cords and the
seniors, cords with leather cuffs and
official sombreros, cleanliness was a
matter of course. The Tradition of
Shabbiness originated with the type
of the flannel-siiirted engineer. The
curves of dirt and lack of the use of
comb and razor show a continual
upward inclination.
In the opinion of alumni certain
traditions have lost their signifi
cance in recent years. No smoking
on Quad, a request of Mrs. Stanford,
was rigidly observed until ten years
ago. There was no smoking even
under the outer arches of the ar
cades and cigarettes were carefully
thrown away on approaching the
steps to the Quad. A jolly-up meant
that dates were not even to be
taken home. One prominent alumni
considers jolly-ups of the present
day to be nothing more than infor
mal dances.
