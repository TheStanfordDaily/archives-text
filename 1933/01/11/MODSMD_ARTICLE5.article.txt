## Mirrielees Lauds Kipling's "Jungle Stories" 
### 
Short-story writer Edith R. Mir
rielees, speaking hist night in the
Little Theatre, piedicted that Rud
yard Kipling's, immortality would
rest chiefly on his fertile imagina
! tion and his "Jungle Stories."
"The 'Jungla Stories' more than
; anything else will approach immor
tality," said Mirrielees, "for they
| present ideas of an Utopian world
i in the only way in which we can
I digest them: ia fairy story wrap-
I pings." The speaker, stripping away
j the jungle background from the
| "Jungle Stories," found in these
' narratives the essence of the good
life. She indicated that the kindly
I "law of the jungle" is the law of
| life.
Miss Mirrielees, long fingers bus
' ily waving, declared that the tre
mendous popularity of Kipling was
phenomenal. She said that but a
! short time ago every two out of
three ribbon clerks and highbrows
had Kipling. "With Henry James
and with The Ladies' Home Journal
he was equally well liked. By none
was he considered an 'untouchable.'
The invention, the animal, and
the Indian stones are the three sig
| nificant groups of Kipling short
j stories. In the first of these, the
Britisher's freedom of imagination is
| predominant.
j
Kipling s aninuu stories are unlike
i those of most authors in that his
j animal world is a kindly world. The
Indian group stresses the spirit of
the supernatural and the powers be
hind the actions of men.
