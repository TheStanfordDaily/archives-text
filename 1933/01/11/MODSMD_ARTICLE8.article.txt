## kirby Page Guest At Y.W. Informal Tea 
### 
Apologizing for painting a dark
picture of present social conditions '
in the United States, Kirby Page, !
editor of "The World Tomorrow" i
and noted lecturer on political and j
economic problems, at an informal j
Y.W.C.A. tea at the Women's Club- j
house yesterday, stated that he sees i
no hope for the immediate future, i
In fact, ten years from now our j
social conditions may be infinitely !
worse, Page believes.
Considered one of the leading au- j
thorities on present economic and ]
religious questions. Page is experi-j
enced not only as an author but is |
equally noted as a world - traveler I
and lecturer. In his travels he has j
met and talked with numerous in- !
ternationally prominent men.
Believing that there is little like- ;
lihood of any far-reaching change •
in the present socialoolder,i l der, Page
stated: "There is scarcely, any dan- ;
ger that the United States will be
Communistic because of the tradi
tion of individualism here. We who
are interested in a change in the .
social order are often disappointed !
in the fact that those who are most •
cruelly affected by our present eco- j
nomic conditions do not realize that i
it is the present system which has '
crushed them." ;
