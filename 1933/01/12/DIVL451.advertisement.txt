to telephone service!
â™¦
Bell System service must go on all the time. Day
and night, Sundays and holidays, it must handle
with speed and accuracy not only the usual traffic
but also the unexpected rush of calls.
To meet this obligation, Bell System men tackle
problems of many kinds. At Bell Telephone
Laboratories, scientists develop new kinds of
apparatus. At Western Electric, engineers find
ways to make telephones, switchboards and cable
more and more reliable. In the telephone com
panies, traffic engineers devise improved operating
methods that make service faster, more accurate,
more dependable.
Result: at noon or in the dead of night, the
public reaches confidently for the telephone,
knowing that Bell System service never stops.
