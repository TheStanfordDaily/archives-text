# STUDENT HEADS ASK BOOKSTORE FINANCE PROBE
## Daily Columnist’s Inquiry Proposal Favored By Karl, Huneke, Kahn AUTHORITIES WILLING Store Managers Okeh Plan For Investigation 
### Rolph Malloch 
Investigation of the Stanford I
Bookstore—of its seemingly peculiar
financial policies and its curious lack j
of profit—was demanded yesterday
by student leaders of the campus, j
Al the same time, Bookstore au- j
thorities announced willingness for
such an inquiry.
Examination of the causes of the j
present financial condition of the j
Bookstore was advocated not in a
spirit of malice or condemnation, j
but as an earnest attempt to find
the facts of a puzzling and important
situation.
Daily Supports Inquiry
Originally advanced by Bull Ses- j
sioner Abe Mellinkoff, the idea of a j
committee inspection of Bookstore j
finances was supported in a Daily j
editorial, and has since been backed j
by many of the outstanding campus
leaders.
Student Manager Charles Karl i
said: "An investigation should take j
place right away. It's a good idea in ,
a dispute like this to get it out. I
respect Mellinkoff, and if the proper ;
authorities agree! the research
should take place now and give the j
Bookstore an opportunity to vindi- I
cate itself."
May He Inefficiency
Vesta Nickerson, secretary of the |
A.S.S.U., said: "The Bookstore is!
for the students' use and should be |
responsible to them. An investiga- ;
tion would be the only thing to do |
as at present we can't tell the truth j
of the rumors."
John Huneke of the Men's Council
said: "I don't think that there's any j
mismanagement, but it should be j
investigated to see if there's any in- |
efficiency."
Eniilie Dohrmann, president of |
Pan-Hellenic, thinks that the inves- I
ligation should not be by students. !
"but by someone who knows what
it's all about."
