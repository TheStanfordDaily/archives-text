# CAMPUS-WIDE RELIEF FUNDS DRIVE IS PLAN
## Ex Committee Authorizes Movement To Help Needy Students 
### 
At a special meeting of the* Execu
tive Committee of the A.S.S.U. last
night plans were discussed for the
launching of a campus-wide drive
for relief of needy students. Atten
tion was brought to a meeting of
the Student Relief Committee Tues
day of the distressing financial con
dition under which many students
are laboring. Bill Corbus, president
of the A.S.S.U., last night called the
meeting of the Executive Committee
to form tentative plans for methods
of relief.
Present plans call for the forma
tion of a student committee com
prising representatives from living
groups and halls which will en
deavor to stimulate interest among
the students in the relief drive. It is
also planned that an all-University
assembly will be held sometime
early next week in which plans for
the drive will be disclosed and sup
port of the movement will be so
licited.
Not Charity
Bill Corbus emphasized the fact
that money raised in the drive will
not be distributed as charity but
that a sinking fund will be formed
which will be used as a pay-roll.
Work in the form of improvement
jobs around the campus will be
created.
Corbus announced last night that
lie will confer with Dean Culver and
Dean Yost and other campus offi
cials for further suggestions in
carrying on the drive.
One Meal a Day
It was brought to the attention of
the Student Relief Committee that
many students on the campus were
subsisting on one meal a day. One
case was reported of a student
whose entire diet consisted of a cup
of coffee and a piece of pie each day.
"In spite of the fact that most stu
dents on the campus feel the de
pression greatly, it is up to us as
Stanford students to help those
among vis who are really in need,"
Corbus said.
More detailed plans will be dis
cussed in the Executive Committee
meeting next Tuesday night when
the report of the Student Commit
tee for Relief will be available.
