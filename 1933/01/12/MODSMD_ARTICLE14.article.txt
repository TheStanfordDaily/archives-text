zine, "Concerning Stanford," now
defunct, has gathered momentum to
the point of the recent action of the
Executive Committee in appointing

they had contributed the first $100.
The editorial said that the requisite
final sum would be $.'150,000. It went
on to suggest that, as soon as the
Pavilion should be paid for, the plan
which has worked successfully for
it be used in paying for a theatre.
The money for the Pavilion was ob

each student's quarterly lee.
The administration states that this

of the University of the origination

Net proceeds, approximately $125,
from the showing of Ihe campus
made movie, "The Fast Male," were
donated to the fund early in 1!)29.
The receipts of the Masque Ball

The entire March Chaparral was
