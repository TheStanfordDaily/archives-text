# Magazine First Started Theatre Fund Movement
## 
### 
How the movement for a Stan
ford theatre, suggested by a maga
zine, "Concerning Stanford," now
defunct, has gathered momentum to
the point of the recent action of the
Executive Committee in appointing
a Theatre Fund Committee is traced
in the following article.
The first record of crystallized
opinion on the subject is to be found
in the copy of "Concerning Stan
ford" for December 1927. In this
article it is urged that Stanford erect
a theatre building which should
contain sufficient space for housing
a School of the Drama, which, the
author felt, Stanford would have
eventually.
Credit for the inception of a con
crete theatre fund goes to Hammer
Mid Coffin, honorary publishing so
ciety. The members of the organiza
tion, publishers of Chaparral, initi
aled the Theatre Fund in their Jan

uary 1929 issue by announcing that
they had contributed the first $100.
The editorial said that the requisite
final sum would be $.'150,000. It went
on to suggest that, as soon as the
Pavilion should be paid for, the plan
which has worked successfully for
it be used in paying for a theatre.
The money for the Pavilion was ob
tained by taking one dollar from
each student's quarterly lee.
The administration states that this
is the first instance in the history
of the University of the origination
with the students of a building fund.
Net proceeds, approximately $125,
from the showing of Ihe campus
made movie, "The Fast Male," were
donated to the fund early in 1!)29.
The receipts of the Masque Ball
were also contribvited to it.
The entire March Chaparral was
devoted to theatre propaganda. A
theatre motif was used. It was the
basis for editorials, jokes, cuts, and
the cover design. A sketch of the
contemplated building was given.
Hammer and CoiYin announced that
the Theatre Fund totaled $2,469.27
at that time.
A vaudeville performance, "The
Theatre Fund Follies," was pre
sented by the combined campus
dramatic societies in April/The pro
ceeds of the evening amounted to
$400.
Activity for 1930 consisted in an
amendment passed by the Executive
Committee establishing a Theatre
Fund Committee. Nine persons were
chosen "to carry forward plans for
raising funds for a. new theatre." No
action was ever taken by this com
mittee.
In the fall of 1931, Abe Mellinkoff,
in his Daily column, suggested that
the Board of Athletic Control erect
a campus theatre after it had com
pleted its financing of the women's
gym.
Aside from general suggestions,
the theatre movement stands as it
did in 1929 with the exception of
the new Theatre Fund Committee,
appointed Tuesday evening by the
Executive Committee.
Today's Campus Opinion column
carries the suggestion that the pres
ent Theatre Fund Committee take
over the defunct Junior Opera and
rejuvenate it as with modern musi
cal comedy, in the event that stu
dent authors can't produce the
goods. It is claimed that this would
raise additional funds for the pro
posed structure, as well as provide
some good entertainment for the
spring quarter.

Aside from general suggestions,
the theatre movement stands as it
did in 1929 with the exception of
the new Theatre Fund Committee,
appointed Tuesday evening by the
Executive Committee.
Today's Campus Opinion column
carries the suggestion that the pres
ent Theatre Fund Committee take
over the defunct Junior Opera and
rejuvenate it as with modern musi
cal comedy, in the event that stu
dent authors can't produce the
goods. It is claimed that this would
raise additional funds for the pro
posed structure, as well as provide
some good entertainment for the
spring quarter.
How the movement for a Stan
ford theatre, suggested by a maga
zine, "Concerning Stanford," now
defunct, has gathered momentum to
the point of the recent action of the
Executive Committee in appointing
a Theatre Fund Committee is traced
in the following article.
The first record of crystallized
opinion on the subject is to be found
in the copy of "Concerning Stan
ford" for December 1927. In this
article it is urged that Stanford erect
a theatre building which should
contain sufficient space for housing
a School of the Drama, which, the
author felt, Stanford would have
eventually.
Credit for the inception of a con
crete theatre fund goes to Hammer
Mid Coffin, honorary publishing so
ciety. The members of the organiza
tion, publishers of Chaparral, initi
aled the Theatre Fund in their Jan

uary 1929 issue by announcing that
they had contributed the first $100.
The editorial said that the requisite
final sum would be $.'150,000. It went
on to suggest that, as soon as the
Pavilion should be paid for, the plan
which has worked successfully for
it be used in paying for a theatre.
The money for the Pavilion was ob
tained by taking one dollar from
each student's quarterly lee.
The administration states that this
is the first instance in the history
of the University of the origination
with the students of a building fund.
Net proceeds, approximately $125,
from the showing of Ihe campus
made movie, "The Fast Male," were
donated to the fund early in 1!)29.
The receipts of the Masque Ball
were also contribvited to it.
The entire March Chaparral was
devoted to theatre propaganda. A
theatre motif was used. It was the
basis for editorials, jokes, cuts, and
the cover design. A sketch of the
contemplated building was given.
Hammer and CoiYin announced that
the Theatre Fund totaled $2,469.27
at that time.
A vaudeville performance, "The
Theatre Fund Follies," was pre
sented by the combined campus
dramatic societies in April/The pro
ceeds of the evening amounted to
$400.
Activity for 1930 consisted in an
amendment passed by the Executive
Committee establishing a Theatre
Fund Committee. Nine persons were
chosen "to carry forward plans for
raising funds for a. new theatre." No
action was ever taken by this com
mittee.
In the fall of 1931, Abe Mellinkoff,
in his Daily column, suggested that
the Board of Athletic Control erect
a campus theatre after it had com
pleted its financing of the women's
gym.
