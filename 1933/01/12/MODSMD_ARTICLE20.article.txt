# PRICE OF PALY SHOWS REDUCED
## Admission To Be 25 Cents For Farm Students 
### 
Stanford students will get their
movies for one quarter, twenty-five
cents, from Saturday on.
That was the good news that
Harry Brown, manager of the Stan
ford Theatre in Palo Alto, released
exclusively to the Daily late last
night.
The reduction will go into effect
at both the Stanford and Varsity
theatres, saving fifteen cents per
picture for every man or woman
who presents his student body card
to the ticket girl.
The pictures will be of the same
quality that students heretofore
have paid forty cents to see. And
the two-bit admittance charge will
be offered to Stanford students ex
clusively.
Brown and George Teckemeyer,
manager of the Varsity, have been
working to get the reduction for
several weeks, Brown said. It was
not until yesterday morning, when
A. M. Bowles, General Manager of
the Fox West Coast Theatres in
northern California, approved the
plan at a meeting in Burlingame,
that the price slash was assured.
"The boys out there on the cam
pus have always played mighty
square with us," Brown said last
night, "and this is our method of
showing our appreciation."
