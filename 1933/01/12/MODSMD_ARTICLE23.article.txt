# Freshmen Sought For Football Managerships
## 
### 
A Block "S" award, transconti
nental trips wilh the team, and a
profitable training in athletic man
agement are several of the possible
benefits to be gained from trying out
for the varsity football managership.
Freshmen aspiring to a senior
manager's job should report as soon
as possible to the football fit-Id Mon
day, Wednesday, or Friday after
noons. Candidates who wait until
spring quarter or the autumn quar
ter of their sophomore year have
relatively little chance of earning
one of the junior manager jobs. It
is from the group of junior man
agers that the senior manager is
(ventually chosen.
