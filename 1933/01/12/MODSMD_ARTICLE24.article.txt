# STANFORD HOOF SQUAD IS GOOD IN SCRIMMAGE
## Coach John Bunn Chooses 10 Varsity Men For U.S.C. Series CARDS ABLE TO LAST Trojans Doped Winners But Indians Show Fight 
### Dick Strouse 
Improper disrespect, and ambitious
disregard for the lofty athletic repu
j tation of the University of Southern
California motivated Stanford's bas
ketball team to outplay the Trojans
1 yesterday afternoon in a practice
scrimmage. Raised to the heavenly
; heights of hoopsterdom, the Indian
regulars outshot, outpassed, and out
guessed an S.C. five that was repre
j sented by proxy by live Card squad
members.
Chuck Coiner, Payne Palmer,
! Frank Stewart, Chuck Rogers, and
John Daniels impersonated Guttero,
Nemer, and their Trojan teammates,
i and if Coach Sam Barry's men are
i no better than their impersonators,
Stanford should win on Friday and
Saturday nights from the cagers
whose football schoolfellows keep
Pasadena in roses and Pittsburgh in
! mourning throughout the year.
Squad of Ten
Coach John Bunn announced
yesterday that he would take ten
men to Los Angeles for the
U.S.C. series and that lie had
suits for all of them. The list
includes Captain Cordry, Top
ping, Palmer, and Glasgowâ€”for
wards; centers, Edelen and
Schnahel; and guards, Hancock,
Tod. Schnetka, and Weaver.
; In the absence of Captain Tom
: Cordry, yesterday's first-string line
' up includes Topping, Glasgow, Ede
j len, Hancock, and Tod. This five
! bottled up the great Guttero's Stan
ford representative and sharp-shoot
ing Jerry Nemer's suit-wearer. And
1 then the pseudo-Trojans tried the
i real Trojans' famous man-to-man
defense and real Indians, Edelen and
| Topping, scored and then scored
| again.
Real Defense
According to the dope, Stanford
: will enter the games in Los Angeh.-i
! with a definite disadvantage in all
! departments of basketball. Southern
I California is supposed to possess the
i class of the California division of the
Pacific Coast Conference. But in the
two games played here, the Cards
; showed that when they remembered
I what Bunn had taught them, they
have a real defense. And the trip
: that included ten games in thirteen
! days has the boys in lasting condi
tion. When Cordry, Topping, and
i Edelen click; they can both pass and
i shoot. Finally, no Stanford basket
j ball team since Bunn's advent as
' coach has been outfought.
