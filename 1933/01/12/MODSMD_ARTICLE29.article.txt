It being the open season for investigations, the Daily
would like to know what the University is going to do with
the old Sigma Kappa house on Salvatierra. For the past
two years this building has remained unoccupied.
I he fact that an unused house depreciates at a very
fast rate would make the opening practical. Secondly, and
far more important, is the room space that this building
would supply for about forty students.
It is a known fact that there are students who are forced
to seek cheap rooms in Palo Alto and Mavfield because
they were unable to find the right room on the campus. It
is also a fact that there are many students living on the
campus whose rooms are unbelievably small and uncom
fortable.
Would it not be possible for the ( niversity to supply
cots and some furniture for this house and then give room
privileges to deserving students? The employment of one
janitor, who could look after the gas and the lighting,
would be quite sufficient. The inhabitants would pay a
certain sum to cover the janitor's pay and the cost of elec
tricity, gas, and water.
If the I niversity should be worried about the govern
ment of this miniature Hall, a student form of manage
ment could very easily be organized.
The advantages for the student of using this house arc
obvious. In the first place, the expense would be very low.
in the second place, this house is in one of the most con
venient positions on the campus, which would help out the
students who were forced to commute under the old con
ditions. And finally, the living conditions would be far
more healthful and comfortable than a lot of lodgings that
students are forced to inhabit now.
