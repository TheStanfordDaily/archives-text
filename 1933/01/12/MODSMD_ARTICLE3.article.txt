These Associated Press Photos show the area mapped in the Daily
last week as the scene of the latest clash between Japanese and Chinese
arms. The upper picture shows Chinese troops at the wall of China near
Shanhaikwan. The lower photo shows where the Pciping-Mukden railroad
ruts through the great viall separating China proper from Manchuria.
The city of Shanhaikwan is of major importance; because it commands the
railway route out of North China into Manchuria.
