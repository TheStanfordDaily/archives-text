# BULL SESSION
## THE 						AXE AND THE OPERA 
### 
And there was a Junior Opera—
which was neither an opera nor
Junior. And it suffered miserably
for many years—hanging on to life
by a bare thread, tradition. Then,
there came a depression. It was
merciless and the Junior Opera
waxed thinner and thinner. Its suf
fering was unbearable and its red
ink was infinite. Yesterday, an axe
fell and all is over.
The poor Opera might be ulive
today, but like many things, it was
unendingly proud. It faced decreas
ing receipts without qualm. Its
prices were high and its expenses
were large. Its income fell and its
deficit rose. In fact, in three years
ihey were able to gather a net loss
of some $1,100.
And 1932 was some kind of a rec
ord, probably—a loss of $500. It was
due to no one in particular. The
Manager sweated appropriately. The
Director worried the correct amount.
But interest has lagged and the
Junior Opera is just another thing—
one of the uninteresting things. It
was great while it lasted and it may
be revivable but for the present it
is just so many red zeros strung
together.
Of course, all things can't be
judged by the cold, cruel hand of
figures. But when anything is so
boring to the majority of the cam

pus as the Opera has been, and per
sists in losing as much money as
the Opera—it is a good time to apply
the steel to its neck. The only ex
ception is something highly cultural
which should be tolerated at a loss,
il possible. The exception does not
apply in the present case.
Of course, the Opera was a lot of
fun. It vied with the Gaieties in giv
ing sororities publicity. There were
always large choruses in which those
suffering from Spring Fever could
escape the Library, Roble lobby,
and other, deadening influences. It
had its place; but like the sweetheart
in the Park Avenue penthouse—it
was too expensive to keep. It was a
prosperity luxury that had to be
dropped. Most people will never
miss it.
The spring quarter probably needs
something dramatic. It's sort of ex
pected. If something can be slipped
in its place—something that will ex
cite enough interest to hold off that
horrid word —deficit, all will be well.
There are several ideas in the air.
Some say that the Opera can be
saved from oblivion in the quick
sands of deficit by letting the Thea
tre Fund Committee handle it.
What is done is not so important
as long as it is realized that pros
perity fancies will have to become
less fanciful. —Abe Mellinkoff

And there was a Junior Opera—
which was neither an opera nor
Junior. And it suffered miserably
for many years—hanging on to life
by a bare thread, tradition. Then,
there came a depression. It was
merciless and the Junior Opera
waxed thinner and thinner. Its suf
fering was unbearable and its red
ink was infinite. Yesterday, an axe
fell and all is over.
The poor Opera might be ulive
today, but like many things, it was
unendingly proud. It faced decreas
ing receipts without qualm. Its
prices were high and its expenses
were large. Its income fell and its
deficit rose. In fact, in three years
ihey were able to gather a net loss
of some $1,100.
And 1932 was some kind of a rec
ord, probably—a loss of $500. It was
due to no one in particular. The
Manager sweated appropriately. The
Director worried the correct amount.
But interest has lagged and the
Junior Opera is just another thing—
one of the uninteresting things. It
was great while it lasted and it may
be revivable but for the present it
is just so many red zeros strung
together.
Of course, all things can't be
judged by the cold, cruel hand of
figures. But when anything is so
boring to the majority of the cam

pus as the Opera has been, and per
sists in losing as much money as
the Opera—it is a good time to apply
the steel to its neck. The only ex
ception is something highly cultural
which should be tolerated at a loss,
il possible. The exception does not
apply in the present case.
Of course, the Opera was a lot of
fun. It vied with the Gaieties in giv
ing sororities publicity. There were
always large choruses in which those
suffering from Spring Fever could
escape the Library, Roble lobby,
and other, deadening influences. It
had its place; but like the sweetheart
in the Park Avenue penthouse—it
was too expensive to keep. It was a
prosperity luxury that had to be
dropped. Most people will never
miss it.
The spring quarter probably needs
something dramatic. It's sort of ex
pected. If something can be slipped
in its place—something that will ex
cite enough interest to hold off that
horrid word —deficit, all will be well.
There are several ideas in the air.
Some say that the Opera can be
saved from oblivion in the quick
sands of deficit by letting the Thea
tre Fund Committee handle it.
