## SOME NOTES ON RECENT EXAMPLES OF THE CINEMA ART. 
### 
During the vacation period no
more than two pictures of real worth
appeared in the local theatres. One
was "Silver Dollar," an unmoving
but sincerely and lavishly produced
biography of Coloradan Haw Tabor.
The leading role was well acted by
Edward G. Robinson, but Aline
MacMahon had the one really mov
ing role. She is an actress of un
usual ability.
"Call Her Savage" is the most 1
vulgar picture I have ever seen.
Formless, stupid, tasteless in plot, j
dialogue, and production, it marked
the return of Clara Bow to the j
screen. It will probably be one of j
the biggest grossers of the year.
Three pictures concerned them- j
selves with sports: "Flesh," "The j

Sport Parade," and "Deception." The
first was the best but by no means
a - fine film. Wallace Beery proved
again his ability to be a dull if
1 powerful creature. The plot move
ment was badly motivated and even
with excellent support by Karen
Morley it could not be made con
vincing. "Deception" was cheaply
conceived and made, as was "The
Sport Parade." All three of the pic
tures concerned themselves with the
| decadence of the wrestling art and
with each picture the bouts took
more footage and the plot became
: less and less important.
A revival of "Trouble in Paradise"
proved again that Lubitsch has made
: one of the most charming of films.
Sophisticated, satiric—it carried all
1 of the sentimental situations to their
j climax and then made fun of them

] deliciously—it is a relief from se
| duction, murder, and sentimentality
and superlative entertainment.
"If I Had a Million" was a nov
| elty, the chief virtue of which was
a two-minute bit by Charles Laugh
: ton. A series of disconnected inci
i dents, slapstick, sentimental, melo
dramatic, it was occasionally very
amusing, brilliant only in one se
quence, occasionally exaggerated,
and emotional. —Sandoe
