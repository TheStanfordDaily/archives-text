CAMPUS BARREN?
, The Editor, Sir:
So at last it's come to this—the
Junior Opera is gone! And with it
perishes one of the few remaining
products of campus originality. Cer
tainly our ,campus is not so barren
[ and devoid of ability in the form of
music and writing that we cannot
turn out an enjoyable evening's en
, tertainment.
It is true, of course, that the Jun
ior Operas of past years have been
somewhat mellowed, but is this not
the fault of the manner of selection?
!If there is nothing worthy turned
in for a competently chosen group
of judges to pick for production,
then it is time to, temporarily at
least, suspend the Opera. But at
least let us have a chance to express
our overflowing abilities, and if they
are not amusing . enough, simply

don't use them.
A period of, for example, one
month could be set aside to receive
manuscripts for consideration. If, at
the end of that time, nothing worthy
of production had been received, the
committee could go ahead and se
lect some popular musical comedy
of recent years and go ahead with
that instead. But let's give some
campus talent a chance first!
And if the Juniors don't want a
Junior Opera, why not let some
other organization do it? It is a
splendid opportunity for the Theatre
Fund group to step in and repeat the
.success of the Theatre Fund Follies
of five years past in this manner.
