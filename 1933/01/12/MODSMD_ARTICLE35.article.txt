# WHY THE BONG?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For the good of Stanford dra
matics, I think a musical revue
should be given during spring quar
ter. If the Junior Opera is abolished,
what will follow? The Gaieties,
shows, and playsâ€”why the sudden
"bong" 011 stage entertainment?
Musically, Winstead Weaver
