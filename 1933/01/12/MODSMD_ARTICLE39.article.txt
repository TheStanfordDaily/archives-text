# ATHLETES NOT FAVORED BY JOBS, SCHOLARSHIPS, OR LOANS--BUTLER

### JACK DROWN 
'"Athletes of the Pacific Coast Con
ference as a whole are not favored
in obtaining loans and assistance
from their universities. Neither did
I find any soliciting of student ath
letes by the members of the league
which was not perfectly in accord
ance with the Conference Code."
Thus states Jonathan A. Butler in
his much-discussed report which
cost the Coast Conference exactly
ten thousand dollars in cold cash.
At Stanford University no viola
lions of the rulings in regard to the
soliciting of athletes by the coaches
were found. Jobs held by the stu
dents were also inspected by the in
vestigator ai*l found to be perfectly
legitimate and that actual service
was being rendered with the pay not
out of proportion.
Athletes have not been given
preference over other students in
the matter of receiving scholarship
loans or jobs, says the investigator
in speaking of U.C.L.A. and the Uni
versity of California. Also bona fide
work is required of all job-holders.
Washington, Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, Montana, and
Idaho do not violate any Conference
rulings in these regards, Butler dis
covered. At none of these institu
tions were athletes favored in ob
taining employment with the pos
sible exception of the University of
Oregon. Even here the work was
found to be genuine and the salaries
were not at all out of proportion
with the labor done. Salaries ranged
from $10 to $35 a month and not all
of the positions were being filled by
sportsmen.
Butler obtained a great deal of in
formation about the University of
Southern California in regard to
loans, scholarships, and the like, but
he found none of their practices to
be illegal. As there are more ru
mors circulating about S.C.'s illegal
practices and their elaborate system
of paying athletes than there are
about any other Conference institu
tion, some of Butler's actual findings
are printed below.
During 1931 and 1932 the U.S.C.
student loan fund extended $25,040
to students, of which forty-three
athletes received $2630. Also during
this same time 289 so-called alumni

j scholarships were granted. Fifty
four were held by men and women
students who had no known athletic
ability, while many others were held
by students who were not candi
dates for any of the major or minor
sports teams during the year.
Butler also checked these scholar
ships and found them all to be
legitimate under the Conference
code.
I Investigation of jobs obtained by
' the alumni employment bureau con
cerning mostly work in the movies
failed to disclose anything of an il
legal nature.
Campus jobs were also checked by
Butler and found to be very legiti
mate and that bona fide service was
beinffgiven for none too exorbitant
pay-
In concluding his survey of ath
letic practices at the University of

Southern California, Investigator
Butler cites no instances in which
any S.C. coach had violated any rule
regarding the soliciting of athletes.
More than 50 per cent of the resi
dents of Toledo own their homes.

Washington, Washington State,
Oregon, Oregon State, Montana, and
Idaho do not violate any Conference
rulings in these regards, Butler dis
covered. At none of these institu
tions were athletes favored in ob
taining employment with the pos
sible exception of the University of
Oregon. Even here the work was
found to be genuine and the salaries
were not at all out of proportion
with the labor done. Salaries ranged
from $10 to $35 a month and not all
of the positions were being filled by
sportsmen.
Butler obtained a great deal of in
formation about the University of
Southern California in regard to
loans, scholarships, and the like, but
he found none of their practices to
be illegal. As there are more ru
mors circulating about S.C.'s illegal
practices and their elaborate system
of paying athletes than there are
about any other Conference institu
tion, some of Butler's actual findings
are printed below.
During 1931 and 1932 the U.S.C.
student loan fund extended $25,040
to students, of which forty-three
athletes received $2630. Also during
this same time 289 so-called alumni

j scholarships were granted. Fifty
four were held by men and women
students who had no known athletic
ability, while many others were held
by students who were not candi
dates for any of the major or minor
sports teams during the year.
Butler also checked these scholar
ships and found them all to be
legitimate under the Conference
code.
I Investigation of jobs obtained by
' the alumni employment bureau con
cerning mostly work in the movies
failed to disclose anything of an il
legal nature.
Campus jobs were also checked by
Butler and found to be very legiti
mate and that bona fide service was
beinffgiven for none too exorbitant
pay-
In concluding his survey of ath
letic practices at the University of

Southern California, Investigator
Butler cites no instances in which
any S.C. coach had violated any rule
regarding the soliciting of athletes.
More than 50 per cent of the resi
dents of Toledo own their homes.
'"Athletes of the Pacific Coast Con
ference as a whole are not favored
in obtaining loans and assistance
from their universities. Neither did
I find any soliciting of student ath
letes by the members of the league
which was not perfectly in accord
ance with the Conference Code."
Thus states Jonathan A. Butler in
his much-discussed report which
cost the Coast Conference exactly
ten thousand dollars in cold cash.
At Stanford University no viola
lions of the rulings in regard to the
soliciting of athletes by the coaches
were found. Jobs held by the stu
dents were also inspected by the in
vestigator ai*l found to be perfectly
legitimate and that actual service
was being rendered with the pay not
out of proportion.
Athletes have not been given
preference over other students in
the matter of receiving scholarship
loans or jobs, says the investigator
in speaking of U.C.L.A. and the Uni
versity of California. Also bona fide
work is required of all job-holders.
