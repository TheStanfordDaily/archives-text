# SEEK TRYOUTEES FOR YELL KINGS
## Rally Committee To Name Two For Positions 
### 
With one meeting of tryoutees for
the assistant yell-leader positions
having been held, but with much
space remaining for others wishing
to get in the running, the annual
job of selection and elimination of
the most and the least promising of
the yell kings-to-be has been started
by the incumbent Prince of Pep,
Jerry Hampton, and his two assist
ants, Dan Ellis and Al Peach.
Two Weeks' Practice
For two weeks the new men will
be put through their paces at the
freshman basketball games, one as
sistant working with two tryoutees
until each man has been given his
chance to reveal his ability before
the rooting sections. At the end of
this experimental period, after each
tryoutee has been carefully consid
ered by the electors, two will be
chosen to assist next year's yell
leader at the big grid games. Inno
vating a new system, the Rally
Committee, rather than the entire
student body, as of yore, will alone
select whom I hey consider the pep
piest duet.
At the first meeting of the try
outees, which was held recently in
the Pavilion, nine men of '35, aspir
ing to some day fill the shoes of
such men as Speegle, McKee, Harris,
and Hampton, reported for action
and were immediately whipped
through some fancy arm-swinging
and leaping to give the boys a hint
of what they might expect in the
future.
Small Turnout
The most startling revelation of
(he entire afternoon was the small
ness of the number who turned out.
"Although every fellow and his
brother were complaining last fall
about the yell-leading situation here
at Stanford now that the opportunity
has arrived when these people can
try out for the job themselves, a
paltry nine show up to do so," Ellis
said. In order that there will be no
such complaints next year such as
were in evidence this past season,
the Rally Committee urges each man
who thinks he has any ability at all
in leading a screaming mob through
a series of organized yells to report
to Jerry Hampton, or to one of his
able henchmen, at the next tryoutee
meeting next Tuesday evening.
