### 
Plans wer& made last night at the
first regular meeting of the Stanford
Rifle Club of the quarter to keep
the range open every afternoon from
2 to 5 o'clock and on Saturdays from
9 to 12 o'clock. Matches start the
week ending January 2') and John
Pascoe, president of the club, urges
everybody who hopes to make the
team to get as much practice as
possible before that date.
Arrangements for an R.O.T.C. pis
tol team were also discussed by Ma
jor Williams, who hopes to enter
the Stanford unit in the national
R.O.T.C. matches between the vari
ous units all over the country. These
matches take place in the spring and
Stanford has never been before been
represented. Recently, however, the
military department has acquired
four new Colt "Woodsman" .22 cali
bre pistols, and although definite
plans have not as yet been made,
Major, Williams hopes to use the
Rifle Club's range in the evenings.
A meeting of all members of the
R.O.T.C. who are interested will be
held next week and if enough en
thusiasm is shown it is probable that
the Rifle Club will also have a team.
The possibility of obtaining two
more .22 rifles from the government
for the use of the club was also dis
cussed.
