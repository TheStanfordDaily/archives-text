# Anthony Sokol Explains Austrian Lantern Slides
## 
### 
Instructor Anthony Sokol gave an
informal explanation of the scenes
shown in the lantern slides of Aus
tria at the meeting of Der Deutsche
Verein yesterday afternoon. This,
the major part of the program, was
introduced by the playing of a group
of German records on a phonograph.
The oldest hospital in the world
is in London.
