# QUAD TO SHOW PLEDGE PHOTOS
## Include Neophytes In Menâ€™s Groups For First Time 
### 
For the first time in history, fresh
man fraternity pledges will be in
cluded in the group pictures of their
respective houses in the Quad, an
nual yearbook. Editor Ray Hanson
announced last night.
Arrangements have been made for
the campus branch of the Watson
studios to photograph pledges of six
houses per day, starting next Tues
day, January 17. The definite sched
ule will be announced in Monday's
Daily, and must be adhered to im
plicitly, since the studio will be open
only one week, Hanson said.
The studios, located at 520 Salva
tierra, will open Monday for those
senior pictures not taken last quar
ter. Only one day has been sched
ules for the clean-up, Hanson de
clared, and those who do not face
the camera then may be left out of
the book.
Second installments on the pay
ment of 1933 Quads must be made
this week to avoid fine, and staff
members will be stationed all day
today at a table at the Engineering
corner to receive money. Next Mon
day the time-payment price will go
up 50 cents.
