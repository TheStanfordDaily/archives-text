# B.A.C. AGREES ON CONTRACT TO THORNHILL
## Length Of Tenure, Salary Withheld Until February 3 
### 
| Terms of "Tiny" Thornhill's new
i contract as head football coach were
! agreed upon last night when mem
' bers of the staff committee of the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control
met with Thornhill at a dinner in
i the Union—but how long the con
! tract lasts, providing the Board of
! Trustees approves his appointment,
I and figures of the new salary, are
a dark secret.
Nothing will be announced until
| the February 3 meeting of the
8.A.C., it was said after last night's
session by Frank L. Guerena, '11,
| chairman of the staff committee.
Thursday Meeting
"We will have another' meeting
j next Thursday evening," Guerena
j added, "but no news will be given
! out then, either. You'll just have to
wait until February 3."
Next week's staff committee gath
! ering will be devoted to Thornhill's
j nominations for the various positions
1 to be filled. An end coach for the
| varsity and a head freshman coach
j are to be filled, definitely, and there
I are possibilities of at least one other
switch, but no information was
| forthcoming last night. Three com
binations for the two principal posi
tions are known to be being con
j sidered, and each man is involved in
i at least two of the combinations.
Minor Jobs Doubtful
Who the men are is still a matter
of thought. The leading candidates
i for the end coach's job—all former
; Cardinal players—are Ted Shipkey,
i now head coach of University of
Arizona; "Spud" Harder, Bakersfield
i Junior College grid director, and
j Jim Lawson, former Stanford cap
j tain and all-American who is in
business in Palo Alto.
The head freshman coach's job is
thought to be connected with Dud
i ley DeGroot, former Stanford cap
! tain and star center, who coached
I San Jose State College and Menlo
| J C. to championships in recent sea
sons. Others are unknown.
