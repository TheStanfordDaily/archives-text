# MOVEMENT FOR SPRING MUSICAL GETS APPROVAL
## Theatre Committee To Meet Monday For Discussion Of Proposals HECHE FAVORS SHOW Substitute For Junior Opera Urged By Students 
### 
Since the announcement that the j
Junior Opera will not be given this j
year, a movement has gained mo- !
men turn to substitute some other i
theatrical production. A musical j
comedy under the direction of the I
theatre fund committee is the most j
widely advocated idea.
When informed of the weight of ;
opinion which favored some such
substitution, Stan Beaubaire, chair- J
man of the theatre fund committee, i
called a special meeting for next ;
Monday afternoon to discuss the j
situation. Harold Helvenston and j
Jack McDowell are advisory mem- S
bers of the committee.
Light Operas Favored
An avalanche of campus opinion j
articles have been received from 1
various students, all favoring some '
spring musical presentation, not ne- !
cessarily a Junior Opera, but pre
ferably something of a lighter na
ture such as "The Band Wagon" or ;
"Good News."
The works of Gilbert and Sullivan
received considerable mention from !
members of (he theatre fund com- j
mittee, when interviewed. All fa
vored the selection of some well- j
known professional offering, rather j
than depending on local talent to !
write the piece. Mary Anita Loos, j
Barbara Collins, Bill Waltman, and !
Marion Hewlett have expressed
themselves as definitely in favor of j
the project.
Heche Approves
Gordon Heche said last night, "I ~
certainly think that Stanford has j
enough talent to produce a good j ,
musical show. Other schoolls can; 1.1

why not-us? In fact, we have. I have j j
yet to see an Opera (and I have seen I
five) that did not entertain the audi- j<
ence. If the Opera, as a Junior Class [
prodigy, was abolished, and a similar I
show taken over by the theatre fund ! ,
committee, it would certainly be due j,
for a success, financially and other- j,
wise." j,
