# ROTH ANNOUNCES ENCINA REFUNDS
## Fall Quarter Boarders To Receive $12 Back 
### 
Continuing the University's policy
of operating Encina Commons on i
non-profit basis, Comptroller A. E.
Roth announced yesterday that the
University will refund approximate
ly forty-eight hundred dollars out of
last quarter's gross income at the ,
Commons to those men who boarded
there autumn quarter. The refund i
will be payable February 1, at the ,
office of the Custodian in Encina ]
Hall.
As there were in the neighborhood 1
of four hundred boarders the refund
will mean about twelve dollars for !
each man. This represents to the in- i
dividual a fourteen per cent reduc- i
tion in the cost of board. 1
This reduced cost was made pos- (
sible by lower food and professional (
labor costs, and was accomplished 1
despite a decrease of thirty in the 1
total number of boarders as com- '
pared with the fall quarter of 3931.
Roth noted that in view of the
need for student employment it was 1
especially gratifying tKSt the reduc- J
tion was not made through a cur
tailment ..of student labor. On the 1
contrary, , approximately five hun- c
died dollars more was expended for
student, labor autumn quarter than
for the corresponding period last
year.
