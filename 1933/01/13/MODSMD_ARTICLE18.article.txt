It will he a big afternoon for the men of 1!(3(> and a bigger evening. I
Some 150 men of the freshman class will go into the rushing lawyer's
office sometime between 1 and 4 o'clock this afternoon to signify which
fraternity they wish to pledge. In the evening the more popular hotels in
the City will be the scene of the welcoming parties for the new Greeks, j
Fraternities will hand in to the lawyer's office between 10 and 11 o'clock !
three-by-five-inch cards, purchased at the Bookstore bearing the name !

-of the fraternity in the middle and ,
the freshman's name in the upper j
corner. Each house may bid 12 men, !
excluding sophomores and junior j
transfers.
The lawyer, O. F. Campbell of (
Palo Alto, will be in his office all
through the three hours for pledg- j
ing in the afternoon and freshmen |
may come in at any time.
Delta Chi May Name Choices
Delta Chi, which was denied j
pledging privileges until January
1934 on being convicted of illegal
rushing practices last quarter, will
be permitted to hand in the names
of 12 freshmen for whom they wish
to wait until the term of the penalty |
expires. Men who signify that they j
will wait will not be bound in any j
way by their decision and may i
pledge another house at any time
during the year. All houses may (
continue to rush these men.
Normal contacts will be permitted
between fraternity men and fresh- j
men on the campus during the |
morning with all rushing rules hold- j ;
ing until after pledging has taken j
place. It will constitute illegal rush- '
ing for any freshmen to enter a '
fraternity house, and Row men will
not be permitted to enter Encina. j
There shall be no off-campus rush- i
ing. During the hours from 1 to 4
o'clock while freshmen are visiting '
the lawyer's office fraternity men
will not be permitted to congregate J
around the Old Union. ;
Go to Houses
After the men have become bona- 1
fide members of a fraternity, they |
may go at once to Ihe house of their IJ
choice. Pledge night, by long custom, j i
has been devoted for parties at the j I
various hotels in San Francisco j I
given by the fraternities in honor of | <
their new members. j <â– 
During the rest of winter quarter j f
and spring quarter the pledges may j
visit their fraternities as often as j
they wish, although according to the j j
rules governing rushing and pledg- j c
ing the house may only charge them j 5
for meals on Saturday. The expense
of any other entertainment is not to !
be born by the pledge. j
