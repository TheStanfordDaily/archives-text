One of the opinions quoted in the I
Daily yesterday favoring an investi
gation of the Bookstore was credited
to Charles Karl, Student Manager.
The Daily hereby acknowledges ils
error in this, as the words were
those of Ike Livermore, president of
the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol. Karl made no statement re
garding the Bookstore.
