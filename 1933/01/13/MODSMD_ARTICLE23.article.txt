# ARMY SLASH MAY HIT R.O.T.C. HERE
## Annual Summer Camp To Be Two Weeks Shorter 
### 
! !
A $31,000,000 slice from the War j
Department appropriation made yes- j
terday in a House Committee will |
J probably shorten the length of the
| annual R.O.T.C. summer camp from |
j six weeks to a month, according to
1 Lieutenant-Colonel D. C. Cubbison, J
commandant of the Stanford unit.
! A reduction of over three millions J
must be made in the R.O.T.C. bud- j
I get. Army officials have agreed that
j the most logical place for the cut
i would be in the summer camp item.
"I am afraid that the camp will
i have to be shortened," Cubbison
1 said. "Last year there was talk of :
abolishing it altogether, so this com
promise seems to be the only solu
tion."
The annual camp, a requirement ,
for all advanced military students, :
is at Monterey from June 15 to Au
gust 1. In addition to free transpor- j
tation to and from the camp, stu
dents receive compensation of 75
cents a day while at the camp. Meals
and quarters are furnished free. I
No other changes in the R.O.T.C.
program at Stanford are contem- i
plated, however, since the reduction '
of the camp budget is believed to j
solve the slashed appropriations. '
