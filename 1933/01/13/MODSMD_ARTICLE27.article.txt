ground for Stanford students, the
1933 Cardinal basketball team has
journeyed down to sacrilegious Hol
' lywood and boundaryless Los An
' geles for a pair of games against the
favored U.S.C. Trojans.
The Indians are inspired by mem
ories of the unhappy football game
with Troy last fall and they are
armed with conditions and sound
basketball fundamentals. It has been
so long since Stanford has defeated
S.C. in a major sport encounter that
! vacations have become earthly hells
I for Farmers and Farmerettes who
I live in or near The Home of the
; Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
: The Bunn boys hope to alleviate
j some of this "Oh-so-you're-from-

In confident expectation of making
Southern California a safer play
ground for Stanford students, the
1933 Cardinal basketball team has
journeyed down to sacrilegious Hol
' lywood and boundaryless Los An
' geles for a pair of games against the
favored U.S.C. Trojans.
The Indians are inspired by mem
ories of the unhappy football game
with Troy last fall and they are
armed with conditions and sound
basketball fundamentals. It has been
so long since Stanford has defeated
S.C. in a major sport encounter that
! vacations have become earthly hells
I for Farmers and Farmerettes who
I live in or near The Home of the
; Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
: The Bunn boys hope to alleviate
j some of this "Oh-so-you're-from-
Stanford" suffering by at least
j breaking even wit hthe Barry boys.
First Conference Game
Tonight's game, coupled with that
! between California and U.C.L.A. at
Berkeley, will open the Southern
■ division of the Pacific Coast Con
! ference's regular schedule. Stanford
invades the Trojan stronghold in the
Olympic Auditorium at 8 o'clock to
| night, and then duplicates the in
j vasion tomorrow evening.
The ten Stanford players, a coach,
; and a manager left at 7:15 o'clock
last night on the Lark, and by now
I they must be well within the geo
' graphic borders of Los Angeles and
within a hundred miles of the city.
: Plans call for their working-out this
morning at the Auditorium, and
| then playing solitaire and tit-tat-toe
until game time.
Ten Go South
Since Bunn has ten suits, he has
taken ten men South, and he hopes
to bring ten equally healthy men
back North Sunday night. The team
—win or lose—is due to arrive at
7:26 o'clock Monday morning at the
Palo Alto Southern Pacific station.
Little Tom Cordry, Stanford's
fighting captain, chief offensive
threat to date, and the best de
fensive forward in Coast basketball,
will start at his left forward post.
