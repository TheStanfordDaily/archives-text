# WE GOTTA HAVE MUSIC
## 
### 
What would springtime be on the Farm, without ;i song
and dance? \ot even a verv wet canoe this year, from the
looks of things. The late Junior Opera, the homicidal vic
tim of "poor box office," with the Dramatic 'Council as an
accessory before and after the fact, will be greatly missed
this .May, even by many of those who never were willing
to pay to see it.
No, there should be a musical production this spring,
;i Junior Opera, a "Hi-jinks" sort of thing, a recent musical
comedy any of those, but the Spring Quarter calls for
music. The Dramatic Council has decided to discontinue
the Junior Opera, but that shouldn't prevent the Theatre
blind Committee from undertaking some sort of musical
production.
The Theatre Fund Committee, with whole-hearted stu
dent support lurking beneath some three thousand skins,
awaiting arousal, could make a success out of such a show.
The lirst thing the Committee needs is the grant of the
dale on the A.S.S.I'. calendar, now held at option by the
Dramatic Council. The release of that date by the Council
would be the first step toward bringing music into the
Assembly llall this Mav.
