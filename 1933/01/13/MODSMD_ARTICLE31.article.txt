Meet Doctor Brown, the man with the little black bag
who has changed about 2X77 campus groans into hymns
of praise by the simple expedient of removing 15 cents
from the price of a show.
For years the rough has screamed and yowled over the
way red-headed damsels behind glass windows tucked
away the four-bit pieces, especially on the nights when
Mickey Mouse's voice cracked. And even the "depression"
10 cents can make a half-dollar look pretty thin.
But night here in the middle of January, when nobody
was expecting anything except maybe a raise in tuition
or in the price of Peter's best, along comes Santa Claus
Miracle Man Brown with his friend George of the Varsity,
and of all things two-bit shows!
Thanks, Doctor.
