# CONGRATULATIONS
## 
### 
Today at four o'clock the ollicial rushing of (lie class of
'.'Mi will have conic to an end. How men can look hack on
the hest conducted rushing period that Stanford has ever
enjoyed. It wasn't perfect, hut the violations were of a
minor character. The experience gained has been invalu
able and will act as a substantial foundation for next year.
Freshmen who have pledged the house that they sin
cerely wanted to go should also receive congratulations.
However, those who failed to get this opportunity, either
because they were not satisfied with the bids they received,
or because they were still unknown on the campus, will be
wise to remember that there are still two more quarters
of living in Kneina when they will have an excellent chance
to meet the new pledges of the houses. Only a few houses
will take the full quota, which will leave many vacancies
that can be tilled at any time this year.
A word of praise to the Interfraternity Council, a hand
clasp to the neophytes, and life on the campus w ill go 011
unruffled by rushing for another year.
