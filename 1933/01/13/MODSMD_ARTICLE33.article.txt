# CULTURE IN THE UNION

Klusivc, will-o'-the-wisp "culture" made an inroad into
tlic private life of "Joe .Tenks, Greene, lowa, LD, 15—15"
this week with the opening of a small loan library in the
t'nion, just above the soda fountain. Ironically enough,
this cultural advantage emanated, not from the University,
bill from a Palo Alto lending library which obtained a spe
cial concession to so operate on the campus.
Disregarding the doubtful humor to be seen in the
I'nion libe's embryonic history, those little brown shelves
.•it the head of the Cellar stairs answer many a student's
prayers for a book to read. True, the big Library is full
of books, and papers, and magazines, and desk assistants,
slow of foot but the prayerful students referred to are
those who seek the modern and the talked-about in litera
ture.
It's disconcerting, to say the least, to hear about a swell
new volume, then to seek it at Stanford's gigantic Library.
The book is always unheard of, going to be ordered, or on
some sort of shelf or other. And it's not entirely the fault
of the Library either. The librarians order the new books,
put them on a display shelf, and then spend the rest of the
year looking for them.
The new t'nion bookshelf will probably not encounter
such difficulties. At a niekel-a-dav arrangement, students
are much less inclined to lose or, well lose their bor
rowed books. And then .... it's pretty hard to picture
anyone lurking in the "stacks" of the new culture center,
waiting for an opportunity to make off with some much
desired volume.
