# BULL SESSION
## WILL THERE BE A TOMORROW? 
### 
The technocrats promised revo
lution in 18 months—except of
course their little scheme is adopted.
And that was almost two months
ago. Some people are not even so
optimistic. Norman Thomas—once
considered radical—has become a
hopeless conservative. He feels that
he and Socialism (which have be
come synonymous terms) will not
be called upon for four years.
Of course, Ossie Spongier, big De
cline of the West man from Ger
many, has long been noted for his
predictions as to just when this
order of ours will crash to hopeless
oblivion. And then there are the
Communists—always good for a ter
rible prediction or two every now
and then. Yet in the midst of all
this blood-curdling prognostication,
we go merrily on our way.
As this system of ours gains mo
mentum in its big slide to oblivion,
we sit by and bid four no-trump,
sip choc shakes, and eager frosh
prepare for their "future." While
economists and engineers travel and
unravel themselves with reams of
figures and charts, the people cheer
Mickey Mouse to more and more
appearances. The death drums be
come little more than a faint hum
in the background as Fio Fita and
in the background as Fio Rita and
them on again eight times a night
seven nights in the week.
The world may be coming to an

end; but no one cares particularly
whether it does or not. In fact,
few people and practically no poli
ticians at all are doing or thinking
anything about it. The most amaz
ing thing is that 14,000,000 un
employed—with unemployment in
creasing—with millions more in debt
—with business dwindling with em
ployment, nothing is done and no
one expects anything to be done.
The most popular remedy seems
to be tighten belts—smile—smile
wider—and, most important, hope.
Which is all comparable to giving a
cancer patient laughing gas; and
trusting for something to happen.
When rumor had it that depression
was merely to be a 60-day Monday
morning hangover from a wild bull
market spree, hope was great. But
hope cannot spring continuously for
three years—the fourth year of con
tinuous slump.
Roosevelt landed himself a four
year lease on the White House upon
the general (but erroneous) expec
tancy that a new order would date
from March 4. And so far, it seems
that a tax on beer is the greatest
piece of legislation to have occupied
the Presidential-elect cranium.
Radical was a horrid word in 1929.
It has become a necessity in 1933.
And while Hearst fiddles and Huey
Long croons, Rome burns—or at
least seems to be in the advance
stages of acute smouldering.
