THE EMPEROR JONES—An opera
by Louis Gruenberg. At (he Met
ropolitan Opera House. (Reviewed
from the premiere as broadcast.)
Louis Gruenberg has made an in
teresting musical setting for O'Neill's
play. But it is hardly an opera. Nor
does it approach the play in dra
matic power although there are in
it moments of considerable intensity
and emotion.
The work is really a long dramatic
recital by Jones which is effective
when Jones is speaking his lines to
music rather than singing them.
Musically the best portions of the
opera are the first scene—the only
period during which what is com
monly known as singing is sustained
for more than a few measures—and
in a poignant prayer which the ex
hausted Jones sings as the catas
trophe approaches.
While -Gruenberg has used music
dramatically and, on the whole, with
properly atmospheric effect, his
work does not build consistently to
the finale. Instead, he works each
scene to a climax and drops it down
again. Some scenes build into others
better than others but on the whole
the work does not rise evenly. Too, a
chorus of bush savages which
shrieks between scenes, tends to de
stroy any effect which would carry
over from the preceding scene. The
drums are used as O'Neill used them
and are less exhausting as fitted to
a musical score than as used alone
in the stage play.
Lawrence Tibbett recited Jones
admirably and, when he had an op
portunity, sang well. The prayer, ex
quisitely done, was his most musical
chance. An Italian tenor singing a
Cockney role was unfortunate, par
ticularly since, except for that, the
vernacular uses of the English lan
guage did not seem ludicrous as
they have tended to in other Ameri
can operas.
An interesting experiment, The
Emperor Jones is essentially a nov
elty. But it should be noted that it
is, if less effectively dramatic than
the play, far more dramatic than
most opera.
It is an unique starring oppor
tunity for, except in the first scene,
Jones carries the entire dialogue

alone. A chorus which appears spor
adically, a native woman with a few
lines, and the Cockney, who appeal's
only in the first scene, are the only
other characters. —Sandoe

THE GEISHA —At the Travers (
Theatre.

Playing in the attractive little
theatre in the Fairmont Hotel, the
Reginal Travers players rang up
the curtain of their nineteen thirty
three season with a revival of Sid
ney Jones' delightful Japanese mu
sical play "The Geisha." The cast,
composed for the most part of San
Francisco amateurs, worked hard to
provide a thoroughly entertaining j
evening.
Ellen Page Pressley, as Lady Con
stance Wynne, and Marsden Argall
i as Reginal Fairfax, proved to be the i
best voices in the cast. Reginal Trav
-1 ers himself stole the show by his
interpretation of the Marquis Imari,

the only part that offered any chal
lenge to dramatic ability. Peter Hes
ter gave a good performance as
Wun Hi, the tea house proprietor.
Kathleen Sherman as Molly Sea
more combined a pretty figure with
' genuine dancing ability to gain a
good reception.
The little theatre, with its obvious
disadvantages, adds a certain in
formality to a musical performance
that forms a pleasing link between
♦he audience and the stage. Good
lighting and excellent stage manage
ment, in the face of cramped stage
facilities, heightened this effect.
"The Geisha" completes its two
weeks' run with tomorrow night's
performance. On January 23d, Aris
tophane's "Lysistrata" will be pro
duced. Oscar Wilde's "Importance of
Being Earnest" and Ibsen's "John
Gabriel Borkmann" loom as possible
future presentations.

in the stage play.
Lawrence Tibbett recited Jones
admirably and, when he had an op
portunity, sang well. The prayer, ex
quisitely done, was his most musical
chance. An Italian tenor singing a
Cockney role was unfortunate, par
ticularly since, except for that, the
vernacular uses of the English lan
guage did not seem ludicrous as
they have tended to in other Ameri
can operas.
An interesting experiment, The
Emperor Jones is essentially a nov
elty. But it should be noted that it
is, if less effectively dramatic than
the play, far more dramatic than
most opera.
It is an unique starring oppor
tunity for, except in the first scene,
Jones carries the entire dialogue

alone. A chorus which appears spor
adically, a native woman with a few
lines, and the Cockney, who appeal's
only in the first scene, are the only
other characters. —Sandoe

THE GEISHA —At the Travers (
Theatre.

Playing in the attractive little
theatre in the Fairmont Hotel, the
Reginal Travers players rang up
the curtain of their nineteen thirty
three season with a revival of Sid
ney Jones' delightful Japanese mu
sical play "The Geisha." The cast,
composed for the most part of San
Francisco amateurs, worked hard to
provide a thoroughly entertaining j
evening.
Ellen Page Pressley, as Lady Con
stance Wynne, and Marsden Argall
i as Reginal Fairfax, proved to be the i
best voices in the cast. Reginal Trav
-1 ers himself stole the show by his
interpretation of the Marquis Imari,

the only part that offered any chal
lenge to dramatic ability. Peter Hes
ter gave a good performance as
Wun Hi, the tea house proprietor.
Kathleen Sherman as Molly Sea
more combined a pretty figure with
' genuine dancing ability to gain a
good reception.
The little theatre, with its obvious
disadvantages, adds a certain in
formality to a musical performance
that forms a pleasing link between
♦he audience and the stage. Good
lighting and excellent stage manage
ment, in the face of cramped stage
facilities, heightened this effect.
"The Geisha" completes its two
weeks' run with tomorrow night's
performance. On January 23d, Aris
tophane's "Lysistrata" will be pro
duced. Oscar Wilde's "Importance of
Being Earnest" and Ibsen's "John
Gabriel Borkmann" loom as possible
future presentations.
THE EMPEROR JONES—An opera
by Louis Gruenberg. At (he Met
ropolitan Opera House. (Reviewed
from the premiere as broadcast.)
Louis Gruenberg has made an in
teresting musical setting for O'Neill's
play. But it is hardly an opera. Nor
does it approach the play in dra
matic power although there are in
it moments of considerable intensity
and emotion.
The work is really a long dramatic
recital by Jones which is effective
when Jones is speaking his lines to
music rather than singing them.
Musically the best portions of the
opera are the first scene—the only
period during which what is com
monly known as singing is sustained
for more than a few measures—and
in a poignant prayer which the ex
hausted Jones sings as the catas
trophe approaches.
While -Gruenberg has used music
dramatically and, on the whole, with
properly atmospheric effect, his
work does not build consistently to
the finale. Instead, he works each
scene to a climax and drops it down
again. Some scenes build into others
better than others but on the whole
the work does not rise evenly. Too, a
chorus of bush savages which
shrieks between scenes, tends to de
stroy any effect which would carry
over from the preceding scene. The
drums are used as O'Neill used them
and are less exhausting as fitted to
a musical score than as used alone
in the stage play.
