Helen of Troy had a face, they say,
That launched a thousand ships—
But yours is the mug that in a day
Can scuttle a thousand quips.

SEATTLE-Vic Meyers, Seattle
jazz-band leader and Lieutenant-
Governor-elect of Washington, said
that if he had his way, he would
abolish the R.O.T.C. at the Univer
sity of Washington and "have tea
dances every afternoon instead." —
Stanford Daily.
For want of a cup the tea was lost
For want of the tea the dance
was lost
For want of a dance the battle
was lost
For want of a battle the army
was lost-
All for the want of teacup frail.

Now why do women get enraged
When asked their name, their
weight and AGE?
