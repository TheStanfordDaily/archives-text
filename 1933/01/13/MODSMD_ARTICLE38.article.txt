# CAMPUS OPINION
## SAY IT ISN'T SO 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With mingled sensations of relief
and regret we learned yesterday
from the Daily that the Junior Opera
is no more. We also were told that
one of the principal causes of its
banishment from the boards of the
Assembly Hall lies in the lack of
satisfactory campus authorship.
That may be so, or it may not â€”
If it is, we can only join the gang
in rendering Irving Berlin's popular
musical plea, "Say It Isn't So" . . .
but why on earth must we take such
things for granted?
Surely, in a year's time, by some
stroke of chance, Stanford might
have increased her enrollment by
one or two writers of more than
average ability. And, surely, resi
dents of the Farm would welcome
the variety offered by a musical
production once a year as in the
past.
However that may be, I offer the
following for campus consideration:

1) As Mr. Salt suggested today,
give the local authors a chance to
see what they can do.
2) If no one script of sufficient
merit is evolved, why not let the
head of the dramatics department
form a class of three or four capable
students, and under his direction,
collaborate on a musical comedy for
production in the spring quarter?
3) In the event that the second
point is not plausible, why not, as
both Mr. Weaver and Mr. Salt ask,
produce a popular musical comedy
of recent years? This would surely
be a welcome innovation on the
campus.
4) And, if no other body is willing
to try it, I believe that, as pointed
out in this column yesterday, those
in charge of the Theatre Fund could
put this over for a good cause and
give us some real musical entertain
ment at the same time.
Yours for some real action,

Co-eds at Northwestern Univer

are informed. Man is such a perfect

men for attempting to imitate him.
