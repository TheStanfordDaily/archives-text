CLAUDE EARL THORNIiILL,
ince being recommended by the j
loard of Athletic Control for the 1
e;id fool ball coach's job, has beer:
ausing the mailmen a Jot of trouble.
Jp to last night, he had received
lore than 400 congratulatory mes- j
ages, which included also a number j
f telegrams.
The biggest share of them have
been from alumni, and many
have asked "Tiny" questions
which will have to be answered
personally. How's the writer's
cramp, Claude?
In his spare moments when he j
asn't been opening letters or figur- <
ng out plans for next fall, Thorn- j
till hay been annoyed by that great j
nventiyn, the telephone. '"Phoney ' j
umors have pulled him out of bed
t such hours as 2:-JO a.m. to tell .
ome misled journalist that "the |
needing will be held tomorrow j
light, and WASN'T held this eve
ling," or "no, plans haven't been ;
nnounced. 1 don't know when they |
vill be made public."
The entire coaching situation
will become a matter of fact and
history on February !>. if all
moves go oft' according to sched
ule. The B.A.C. holds its next
session on February a Friday,
and Ihe board of trustees is
calendared for the second Thurs
day of each month, which will
be the ninth of February.

FRANK LOMBARDI, promising |
rackman who returned to school
his quarter, has finally decided to i
urn out for his favorite spoil in- j
tead of playing baseball. After get- i
ing a taste of diamond dust for the j
irst time in a couple of years, Frank |
elt the urge of cinders and is now j
ngaged in picking 'em up and lay- '
n' 'em down.
808 MOORE, who gave prom
ise of developing into a first
class halfback on last fall's foot
hall team, did not return this ,
quarter. He lives somewhere in
lowa, and is reported to have
enrolled at the University of
Illinois.
That's a good prospect gone. His
loss will be offset, however, with the
■raduation to varsity ranks of
'Bones" Hamilton and Bob Grayson
■if the frosh.
THE RESIGNATION of Paul !
J. Schissler at Oregon State Col
lege is not too great a surprise.
He did a presentable job as j
head football coach there, but
had the misfortune to have a lot j
of dissatisfied students and
alumni heckling him.
A football coach, like anybody •
else, is only human, and when peo- j
pie get to riding him, he has the 1
perfect right to politely thumb his
nose at them and pull freight.
Schissler will probably not have
great difficulty signing up with an
other institution. —B.L.
