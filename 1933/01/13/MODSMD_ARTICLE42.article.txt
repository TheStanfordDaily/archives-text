# Ball Practice Opens With Eight Veterans Back
## SOPHS, TRANSFERS BRIGHTEN CHANCES FOR VARSITY NINE Wolter At Work Now With Tryouts To Bring 1933 Team Into Shape 
### 
j Boasting a turnout of more than
half a hundred aspiring horsehiders,
including eight lettermen from last
j year's outfit, Coach Harry Wolter is
hard at work upon the 1933 edition
j of the Stanford varsity ball team.
The eight veterans are: Stan An
derson and Hermann Estes, pitchers;
Captain Norman "Ike" Livermore,
j and "Sunny Jim" Massey, catchers;
Jerry Trautman, third-baseman;
! Bert Delinas, shortstop; Bill Triplett,
I second-baseman; and Dick Miles,
! outfielder.
Many Promising Hurlers
With a number of promising play
; ers from last year's strong freshman
■ nine, and some good transfers, Wol
ter is looking forward to a much
1 more successful season than the
I team had in 1932 when it finished in
a tie for fifth place with nine games
won and nine lost.
Backing up his veteran hurlers,
Wolter will have Harry Stark, Bob
Savinski, and Lofty Campbell from
: last year's squad, and Fred Heringer
1 from the '35 team.
One of the hottest battles for
! places on the team looms around
| first base, where Gordy Mallatratt,
, Lowell Nutting, Art Hearn, and Jim
Woolley are fighting for the first
i call.
Second Base Fight Rages
I Second base, seems at present to
! lie between Bill Triplett and Chuck
Clancy, a transfer from Menlo J.C.
Bert Delmas, a two-year letter
man, and the star of the 1930 fresh
| man team, will receive his stiffest
j competition from Bob Maentz, a
I junior who plays good ball, but so
far has failed to crash the varsity
lineup.
Outfield Still Weak
At third base, the well-known
! "hot corner," Trautman seems to be
j well ahead of his field, and will
! probably hold down the position
j again this year.
j In the outfield, Wolter will run up
! against his hardest problem. Since
! Goldman failed to return to school,
j and Miles is the only letterman to
| report, the other two positions will
| have to be filled from the ranks of
j the sophomores or the transfers.

j Boasting a turnout of more than
half a hundred aspiring horsehiders,
including eight lettermen from last
j year's outfit, Coach Harry Wolter is
hard at work upon the 1933 edition
j of the Stanford varsity ball team.
The eight veterans are: Stan An
derson and Hermann Estes, pitchers;
Captain Norman "Ike" Livermore,
j and "Sunny Jim" Massey, catchers;
Jerry Trautman, third-baseman;
! Bert Delinas, shortstop; Bill Triplett,
I second-baseman; and Dick Miles,
! outfielder.
Many Promising Hurlers
With a number of promising play
; ers from last year's strong freshman
■ nine, and some good transfers, Wol
ter is looking forward to a much
1 more successful season than the
I team had in 1932 when it finished in
a tie for fifth place with nine games
won and nine lost.
Backing up his veteran hurlers,
Wolter will have Harry Stark, Bob
Savinski, and Lofty Campbell from
: last year's squad, and Fred Heringer
1 from the '35 team.
One of the hottest battles for
! places on the team looms around
| first base, where Gordy Mallatratt,
, Lowell Nutting, Art Hearn, and Jim
Woolley are fighting for the first
i call.
Second Base Fight Rages
I Second base, seems at present to
! lie between Bill Triplett and Chuck
Clancy, a transfer from Menlo J.C.
Bert Delmas, a two-year letter
man, and the star of the 1930 fresh
| man team, will receive his stiffest
j competition from Bob Maentz, a
I junior who plays good ball, but so
far has failed to crash the varsity
lineup.
Outfield Still Weak
At third base, the well-known
! "hot corner," Trautman seems to be
j well ahead of his field, and will
! probably hold down the position
j again this year.
j In the outfield, Wolter will run up
! against his hardest problem. Since
! Goldman failed to return to school,
j and Miles is the only letterman to
| report, the other two positions will
| have to be filled from the ranks of
j the sophomores or the transfers.
