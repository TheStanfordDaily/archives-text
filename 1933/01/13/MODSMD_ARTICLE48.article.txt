# CARD GOLF SQUAD STRONG IN SPITE OF LOSS OF STARS
## Farm Prospects Promising; Seaver, Hanley Leave Varsity Team 
### Jay Graves 
"The best varsity golf team we
I ever had" is still a good team —even
after two of its stars have left school.
When Charlie Seaver and Stew
Hawley left this quarter, things
looked bad for the Card potential
Pacific Coast championship golfers.
But now Coach Eddie Twiggs
comes forward with the news that
the gaps have been filled with stars
almost as good—Gene Brown, Tom
Dwyer, and Dick Giddings.
What was a wonderful outfit last
fall is still a way-above-average
bunch. A well-balanced team head
ed by Lawson Little and Harry
, Eichelberger should be able to win
almost every match.
Although Twiggs still thinks that
Cal will be an easy match for the
Card stick-swingers, with Seaver
and Hawley gone, at least four
points are as good as lost to the
! Berkeleyans.
This loss may prove serious in the
Minor Sports Carnival but Hawley
! may be back in school by that time.
Twiggs is optimistic about the
freshman squad. It's over a hundred
per cent better than the frosh squad
that beat California last year, so
there will be no trouble for this
year's baby Cards to take the Cub
golfers.
Qualifying rounds played this
week found Gene Brown, Tom
Dwyer, Dick Giddings, and Bill
Mendel heading the varsity list.
| Don Edwards, Bud Nicholas, Bob
Thompson, and Ed Littlefield hold
top positions on the frosh ladder.
