# '500' CONTINUE RUSHING TODAY
## Serious Violations Absent In Opening Period 
### 
The final period of women's rush
ing will open today, following a pre
liminary period remarkable for the
absence of serious infractions of
Pan-Hellenic rules. Such minor of
fenses as occurred were dealt with
in a manner considered in accord
ance with the seriousness of the
violation.
New and sorority women will
meet again at dinner tonight con
trary to a previous announcement
in the Daily, and rushing will con
tinue through Thursday, with the
exception of Wednesday night.
Pledging takes place next Friday.
Appointments with the lawyer will
start at 7:15 o'clock. As soon as each
woman has indicated her choice, she '
will be driven up the Row by alum
nae. When all the pledges have ar
rived, the houses will be open to
men for dancing until 12 o'clock.
With pledging only a short time
away, Emilie Dohrmann, Pan-Hel
lenic president, urges that each new
woman make an individual decision,
disregarding the .opinions of friends
or interested outsiders. At the same
time, Pan-Hellenic is making an ef
fort to prevent sororities from exert
ing pressure on freshmen, either di
rectly or through men or alumnae.
Offers for financial aid must be
submitted to the Pan-Hellenic pres
ident not later than noon of the day
following pledging, together with a
bid. These will be given to the
freshmen, if they have gone unde
cided, by Anastasia Doyle, director
of Roble.
