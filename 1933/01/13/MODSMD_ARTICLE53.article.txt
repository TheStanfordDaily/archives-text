## Expert Pries Into Amateur Conditions; Findings Clear P.C.C.

series of five articles dealing wit'n
the Jonathan Butler report.- Editor's

Although Jonathan Butler's report
on athletic conditions within the
Pacific Coast Conference has been
called everything from*a "dud" to
a "wash-out" by some of the best
known sports writers in the West,
there arc some other angles to be
considered.
In the first place, Butler was paid
to proceed with his investigation on
the basis that the Conference rules
should be the standards of measure
ment and not what he himself be
lieves should be the ideal standards.
Because he found practically no il- |
legal practices taking place, while j
working on this basis, sports writers |
all over the country raise a hue and j
cry.
Many of the "wise boys" practi- j
cally claim that the investigator un- !
covered only as much as he was paid ,
to find. Others have intimated that i
Butler was given ten thousand dol
lars for his 48-page booklet and sev
eral times that for not releasing a I
pamphlet several times larger and |
not as mild.
Be that as it may, a careful scru
tiny of the various sport sections ;
fails to disclose any evidence of the I
possibility that perhaps some of the !
rumors floating around previous to !
the report about illegal practices I
might have been rumors only. The ;
possibility that Butler may have I
printed the actual league conditions '
seems to be entirely overlooked by j
the great majority, mainly because |
the pamphlet fails to dynamite and !
knock the props out from under the |
Conference.
Press Oversight
Probably the most important over- ■
sight on the part of the critics is 1
that a committee of the Conference
will consider in detail the findings ,
and especially the 24 recommenda
tions of his report at a special meet- j
ing. Findings and recommendations j
of this confab will be submitted to j
the next regular get-together of the 1
Conference for action.
Some of the most important of
Butlex-'s suggestions are listed be
low:
1) That the Conference consider I
the desirability of raising its aca- j
demic standards for athletic eligibil
ity-
-2) That the Conference consider j
the desirability of rewording its j
rules relative to the solicitation of j
athletes and other recruiting restric- i
tions.
3) That the Conference consider i
the desirability of either rescinding j
its present rule relative to coaches i
and athletic officials speaking at i
meetings where high-school athletes i
are present or extending it to cover i
all speeches.
4) That the Conference Consider \
the desirability of decreeing that any j
grade or course not acceptable by i
the university toward graduation
shall not be acceptable toward es- j
tablishing or retaining athletic eli- i
gibility.
5) That the Conference consider j

the advisability of abolishing fresh
man intercollegiate .competition 01
restricting it to not more than one
| contest in each sport.
6) That the Conference consider
I the desirability of determining
I whether the following practices are
j legitimate or proper:
a) For a college directly or. indi
! rectly to extend to a prospective
j athlete student a job which may be-
I come a factor in determining the
I college in which he will enroll.
b) For a college to extend to ath
| lctes tuition scholarships or cash
•»V

scholarships in greater proportion
than it extends to non-athletes.
c) For a coach or athletic official
to conduct solicitous correspondence
with a prospective athletei
d) For a university to maintain
an employment bureau especially
for athletes.
e) For coaches or athletic officials
to solicit jobs on behalf of athletes.
f) For a university to provide spe
cial tutoring services for athletes.

that a committee of the Conference

ing. Findings and recommendations j

the desirability of rewording its j
rules relative to the solicitation of j
athletes and other recruiting restric- i
tions.
3) That the Conference consider i
the desirability of either rescinding j
its present rule relative to coaches i
and athletic officials speaking at i
meetings where high-school athletes i
are present or extending it to cover i
all speeches.
4) That the Conference Consider \
the desirability of decreeing that any j
grade or course not acceptable by i
the university toward graduation
shall not be acceptable toward es- j

gibility.
5) That the Conference consider j

6) That the Conference consider
I the desirability of determining
I whether the following practices are
