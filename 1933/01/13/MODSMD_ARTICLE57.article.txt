# INDIAN FROSH MEET BALBOA HIGH TONIGHT: SACRAMENTO JUNIOR COLLEGE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Afte ropening the season against
two of the strongest freshman teams
in Northern California—San Fran
cisco University and St. Mary's (two
defeats for Stanford) —the Indian
yearling quintet faces less opposi
tion this week.
Balboa High, a prep team of only
average strength, meets Jimmy
Bradshaw's team tonight. On Satur
day Sacramento Junior College trav
els to' the Farm.
Balboa uses an exceptionally fast
break, but their defensive play has
always been fairly ragged. This lat
ter factor may enable Addie Barnett
and Wally Brooke to sink numerous

close-in shots daring tonight's game,
while Ralph Mannion is dropping
them in from the foul-line vicinity.
There is a possibility that Don
Greenlee, the highly touted Glen
dale player, may find his shooting
eye tonight. Greenlee looked good
handling the ball against St. Mary's,
but his scoring was sub-par. Guards
Maentz and Farber showed much
better form against St. Mary's last
Saturday than they did in the sea
son-opener the night before.
Sacramento has for many years
been a factor in Northern California
junior college circles, but graduation
has badly depleted the ranks of its
1932 team.
