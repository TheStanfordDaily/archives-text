### 
Commemorating the anniversaries
of two famous authors, the library
exhibit cases now contain rare old
volumes of the works of Walter
Scott and Louisa M. Alcott.
Nine first editions, in the finely
executed printing peculiar to his
time, comprise the Scott display. The
occasion is the centenary of the
death of the famous Scotch novelist;
the books are loaned through the
courtesy of the Fenton Memorial
Library.
