WHAT?
RADIO?
Major Howard Angus, former
V. P. of the National Broadcast
in); Company, says: "Radio offers
a wide scope for talent — the tech
nique ot program production,
merchandising, writing, scientific
research, even financing. To suc
ceed, the young man of today
must have a thorough training,
an alert mind, a clear head."
REWARDS ill radio go to the man
with an "alert mind" and a
'dear head." This kind of man, in
this business as in collegc, elects the
pipe his favorfre smoke. And any
:ol!cge man can tell you his favorite
;moking tobacco— Edgeworth.*
This is only natural — for in all
iobaccodotn there's no blond like the
fixture of fine old burlcys found in
Edgeworth. In that difference there's
new smoking satisfaction, new smok
ing comfort. Like to try before you
