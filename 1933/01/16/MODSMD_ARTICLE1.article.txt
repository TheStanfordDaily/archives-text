# HOOPMEN LOSE HEARTBREAKER SERIES TO S.C.
## Trojans Take First Game Of Series 30 to 25, Second 38-36 TOPPING HIGH SCORER Stanford Vastly Improved In L.A. Contests 
### Dick Strouse 
Stanford University's theoretically j
weak basketball team disregarded
Iheories and their own inferiority j
complex to play smashing, heady,
infinitely improved ball while losing j
to Southern California twice over
the week-end, 25 to 30 and 36 to 38.
It was the supposedly least efli— |
cient of the Pacific Coast Conference |
squads that battled the supposedly j
strongest member of the Pacific |
Coast Conference on even terms j
through eighty thrilling minutes and j
finished tragically with but seven '
points less than their opponents. It ;
was Coach John Bunn's soundly j
drilled, fighting quintet that went |
South without a chance and came j
home at 7:21 o'clock this morning j
with the respect of the entire cage- i
wise Coast.
Ayres Is Different
The first game was the story of
too much Trojan Jerry Nemer and
too much Umpire Gerald Ayres. j
Characterized by sports writers as ,
performing in such an atrociously !
idiotic fashion as to make a novel
contribution to the art of officiating,
Ayres was hissed by even a Los
Angeles audience.
Nemer scored 16 points, and he
was simply too hot on Friday night ]
to be stopped. It was lucky for Ele- j
vator Sam Barry's elevated hard- ]
court giants that Nemer was in j
form, for Stanford pulled her first j
surprise of the series by building up j
a 20 to 13 lead by half-time.
Second Half? Sh!
But the second half of the first j
game was a 17 to 5 Trojan triumph, j
Stanford apparently being off form, j
as Jay Tod alone could score a field
goal against the suddenly impene- j
trable S.C. defense. Captain Tom ■
Cordry led the* Cards that night |
with nine clever points, and his fel- |
low forward, Keith Topping, fol- j
lowed with eight digits.
Either pent-up energy from free !
hotel meals or pent-up desire for a •
win over Troy transformed the bas- j
ketball court in the second game to j
a football field and the basketball
players into pugilists. Frail Chuck
Glasgow proved a participant in the j
evening's climax when he broke up :
a game of S.C. keep-away and was i
tackled for his audacity by Trojan '
Bcscos.
Keith Topping, who is Stanford's
varsity light-heavyweight, liked the
rough going and scored eleven points j
before being ejected for four per
sonal fouls. Topping was the Indian !
high-scorer for the series, but John ,
Hancock, who is supposed to be but 1
a defense-playing guard, came i
through with 12 points in that sec- j
ond game.
Led by Hancock and Topping, |
Stanford led 1!) to 17 at the half, and i
then helped tie the score four times j
in the second period. The inevitable ]
Nemer finally broke a 35-35 dead- i
lock with a field goal and a free
throw, and Glasgow's successful toss '
after his painful foul ended the 1
scoring.
