# Quainton Stresses Need Of Experiencing Religion
## 
### 
The Very Reverend Cecil S.
Quainton dean of Cathedral, Vic
toria, 8.C., stressed the difference
between accepting the religion of
one's parents and experiencing it, in
his sermon yesterday morning in the
Memoi'ial Church.
"There is no intellectual solution,
but one must be lifted spiritually,"
he said. This spiritual uplift comes
at the end of the intermediate stage,
that of doubting the religion handed
down. He suggested that instead of
speaking of the high and low church
people, one should use the word
"deep."
