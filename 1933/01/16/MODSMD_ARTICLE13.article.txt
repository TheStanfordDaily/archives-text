# Ow! Farm Yields Weekly $1406 'Nuisance' Taxes
## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
Stanford students may pay little
attention to the cries of burdened
taxpayers and heed with disintered
ness the pork barrel, budget, and
economy battles waged in Washing
ton, but they contribute a consider
able amount of the financial oil that
lubricates the wheels of the federal
government.
An estimate made by members of
the Daily staff indicates that the
average student contributes approx
imately 46 cents a week per capita
to the United States treasury. Multi
plying the "average student" by
3,059 a total of $1,406 is obtained.
Amusements High
Largest of the various taxes paid
is that levied on amusements. Al
though Uncle Sam exacts no toll
from the Rough who frequents the
Palo Alto opera houses, he does de
mand his duo when prices of ad-

mittance are above 40 cents. About
20 cents a week is paid out in this j
manner to theatres and hotels.
The tariff on cigarettes (6 cents
for a package of 20) and tobaccos is
the next largest drain on the stu- j
dent's pocket. Counting men, wo- I
men, smokers, and non-smokers, the \
average tax paid is determined to
be 17 cents.
Bank Check And Oil
The 2-cent tax on checks very
probably reaps little more than 4
cents a week, due to the compara
tively small number cf students
maintaining checking accounts. Fed
eral gasoline and oil taxes absorb 5 j
cents a week.
Federal taxes which affect Stan
ford students to a negligible degree 1
are those on telegrams, long distance
telephone calls, and especially in
enmps!
