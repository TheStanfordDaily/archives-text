# Swain Allows Students' Quiz Of Bookstore
## Corbus, Lesley To Confer Today On Probe 
### 
i As a definite step toward clearing
l the Stanford Bookstore situation,
i Bill Corbus, A.S.S.U. president, an
| nounced last night that as a result
I of a conference with Acting-Presi
' dent Robert E. Swain, the investi
gation, promoted in Daily editorial
and Bull Sessioner columns, had re
! ceived official administrative sanc
| tion.
i Dr. Swain was off the campus over
Sunday and could not be reached.
His statement to Corbus said that
although he felt this was not a mat
! ter for his decision, it had always
j been a policy of the University to
! permit student commmittees to
! probe cases of dissatisfaction. Since
I the Bookstore is run on a student
I co-operative basis, it is the under
graduate right to satisfy itself that
there are no irregularities, Swain
declared.
Corbus plans to confer today with
i Dr. E. P. Lesley, president of the
! Bookstore's board of directors, con
| cerning the method of investigation
i and the naming of a committee.
I Until after the conference with
, Dr. Leslie no definite steps can be
I taken toward appointing the com
| mittee, but Corbus announced that
it would probably be made up in
part of Daily men and representa
; tives from the Stanford School of
i Business.
