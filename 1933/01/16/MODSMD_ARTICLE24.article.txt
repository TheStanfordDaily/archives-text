WHO'S GOT A BUTTON?
Like sardines tliev wore packed, Jail then tliev didn't
look very much like fishes. 1 hev would all troop out on
fhe floor and flien all troop hack again. They all knew
each oilier huf then they greeted one another as though
they hadn'l met for years. II was all very mysterious to the
gentleman from lowa, hut we could have told him it was
only pledge nighl.
Yes, I hey were all Greeks. All brothers. It had been
said they were out culling each others' throats only that
morning, but then no gentleman from lowa would be in
lereslod in lliat. Each little clan was Irving to impress their
new members willi the jollity of the life on a certain Row. |
Some of the new members were even beginning to wonder j
Everyone was natural again for the first time since Oc
tober. It didn't change some but others didn't look quite
the same. Even the gentleman from lowa could tell the
iieophvles. They looked so hopeful, so happy.
I here was a lot ol noise. The reproducing was too
loud, but who cared? The freshmen were starting out on
something new. This was college. II glittered. II was full
of promise.
