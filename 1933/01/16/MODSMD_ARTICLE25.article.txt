The announcement lasl week of Hie drastic cut in the
H.A.C. salaries came as a bombshell to many Stanford men.
However, in the past few days several other well-known
universities have made similar slashes in their athletic
budgets.
II is clear now that the wolf is howling outside the gate
of that inflated firm- American athletics. The hungry
beast is not a local menace but a national ravager. Yale,
Princeton, and Cornel are three of the universities in the
Has I which bear the marks of the animal, while U.S.G. is
the only coast institution which has kept its hide in one
piece.
Amateur sport will undoubtedly benefit from this gen
eral shake-up. The old cry that big business was ruining
the simon pures was no exaggeration. Theoretically sport
is played for the fun of it and not for the gate receipts.
Now that currency is becoming as rare as old colonial
antiques the big "shows" of the boom era will give way to
the more simple contest between students who want some
exercise.
Like the sudden plunge into a mountain lake, the shock
is great but the reaction is verv healthy.
