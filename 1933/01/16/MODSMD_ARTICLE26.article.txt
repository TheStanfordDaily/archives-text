# AN EXPERIMENT
## 
### 
For years Stanford lias been one of the few universities
in this country to have a definite division in its four-year
undergraduate course the upper and lower divisions so
called.
Huckncll has recently re-organized its curriculum so
as to include the two divisions. However, this university
lias gone one step farther than Stanford bv eliminating all
required work in the upper division. A supervised elective
schedule for concentration in fields of special interest will
be substituted.
The results of the practical application of this plan
should be looked for with interest by all educators. It
seems doubtful, at first glance, whether the "elective sched
ule" will be as satisfactory as Stanford's upper division
departmental requirements. These required courses have j
been decided on by the professors of the departments :
whose long years of experience with the subjects well !
qualities these selections.
It would he almost impossible for the undergraduate to
know what courses would give him a well balanced knowl- j
edge of his subject, and then, of course, electives are often J
chosen on a whim of the moment or because the class j
conies at eleven instead of eight o'clock.
