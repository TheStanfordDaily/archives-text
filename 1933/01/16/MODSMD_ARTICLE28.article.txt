# BULL SESSION
## WILL THE CONCERTS GO NEXT? 
### 
There is something contagious in
killing. Once, one head begins to
roll, the populace is very apt to cry:
"More, more." There is a horrible
fascination in continued lopping
once the original lop is made. And
the Stanford Campus seems to have
its lopping blood up. This rising of
the murderous blood is aided and
abetted by the wonderful opportuni
ties for honest decapitating with
which our campus abounds.
To nip any incipient campus opin
ions that may have been fertilized
in some literal minded brain by the
above paragraph—we of course must
state that the Bull Session is not
advocating a bloody Reign of Terror
to be started by a guillotining of the
Bookstore Manager. The killings we
refer to are the extermination of
financial liabilities—extravagances.
The Board of Athletic Control
started off the quarter with a beau
tiful 10 per cent cut and a net sav
ing of $13,000. On the campus, the
B.A.C. has always been associated
with the U.S. Mint —but they (the
8.A.C., not the Mint) felt the de
pression and cut expenses.
The next to feel the axe was the i
Junior Opera. It lost $500 last year
and the Dramatic Council dispatched
it in quick order—the dispatching
being approved by the Ex Commit
tee. The Concert Series has been

lodged in Death Row for some time.
Every time as the axe begins to fall,
somebody grabs a stay of execution
and the Concerts are saved.
Wednesday night at 8:30 o'clock is
the zero hour. The San Francisco
Symphony has a date with the Cam
pus. If the Campus fails to keep fhe
date, it is no great indication of
psychic powers to say that the Con
cert Series will be dragged to the
gallows and disposed of—despite the
groans from the music lovers who
spend so much time writing Campus
Opinions defending the Series they
never attend. When not writing
Campus Opinions, these music lovers
bemoan the low musical taste on the
Campus.
So far this year, the Series has
managed to keep even keel. If they
can ride Wednesday's storm, all will
be well. And if they don't all will be
well ruined. Molinari should be able
to pack the house. He even packs
the Hollywood Bowl —with a seat
ing capacity of over 20,000. In fact,
Molinari is so popular, he even has
the Long Beach lowans shouting
"bravo, bravo" before the concert is
over. And that's something.
! So momentous is Wednesday's
! concert, that the women are going
to take time out on their great game
of rushing to attend. To live or not
to live is the question. Answer:
Wednesday night. —Abe Mellinkoff
