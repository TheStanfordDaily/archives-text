# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the midst of a campaign di
rected toward Student Relief it is
especially commendable that the
Daily in its editorial column has J
brought forward a suggestion that is
not only pertinent but also very
practical in its possible application.
I refer to the policy outlined in
challenging the University to put to
use the now vacant Sigma Kappa
house on Salvatierra. Here is a real
idea! It does not delve into "charity,"
but presents a common sense busi
ness viewpoint that can be directed
for the common good of all. This is
a chance for needy students to help
themselves, which is far more self
respecting than direct aid.
This has also great possibilities!
With the right type of students it
would create for them a more ideal
campus life not otherwise possible
in more remote surroundings.
If the University resorts to all
kinds of ingenious devices in its ap
peal for student aid why don't they
put into effect this most timely sug
gestion. Nothing could be more
beneficial.
Sincerely yours,
Oscar Baer, '33

the people have as much confidence
in the next President as they had in
