TOO TRUE TO HE CiOOD (Shaw).
At the Columbia Theatre.
Shaw's plays have showed a steady
progression away from drama. The
present play tries to do several
things as impossible as any Shaw
has before attempted, but his usually
tine dramatic sense fails partly, and
the resulting play is an odd mixture
of incoherent fragments. Plot is al
most entirely dispensed with, being
even less important than in a revue.
There is no consistent attention to
any idea, or even set of ideas; the
characters are poorly defined, incon
sistent, arranged with little sense for
dramatic contrast.
A brief preface by Shaw given in
the program would indicate that his
main theme is the ideas of pleasure
through reckless excess produced by
the war and the reaction to such
ideas by the coming generation. An
other statement of theme comes in
the magnificent epilogue, where we
hear in a new way the somewhat
old idea of futility, the war's shat
tering of ideals, and the conflict of
man's desire for idealism with this.
There are several other keynote
speeches, notably one in which a be
liever in Newtonian determinism
shows the shattering of his fixed
ideas by modern science. There is a
speech by the Sergeant containing
some of Shaw's most bitter remarks
against war; another speech—the
Burglar's—makes cynical comments
on respectability and reiterates the
theme of Major Barbara that pov
erty itself is a vice.
From this may be gathered thai
"Too True To Be Good" is a series
of fragments, some of high quality,

but poorly tied together. This belief
is further substantiated when one
recognizes in Private Meek, who
dominates the second act but has
nothing to do with the play, a flat
tering representation of Col. T. E.
Lawrence.
This first act is pure farce, slow
moving, and stating nothing. The
only novelty is the introduction of
a Microbe; whatever purpose this
was supposed to serve is not clear.
Possibly Shaw wanted someone to
comment on the action, but very
few of the Microbe's speeches serve
this result. Its only important line
is the curtain speech, announcing
that the play Is over, and the char
acters will discuss it for two more
acts.
The second and third acts are
more episodic in character, but move
more rapidly and contain all the
fragments of ideas that Shaw has
put into the play.
As regards the acting of this
strange product, all honors go to
Barry Jones as the Burglar. The play
is hardly a good acting vehicle, but
the many changes of mood and the

long speeches require an accom
plished actor to hold an audience.
These requirements Jones met per
fectly. But as the part has no char
acter of its own Jones was also able
to add much, and the resulting char
acterization was similar to his roles
in "The Queen's Husband" and
"Arms and the Man."
Colbourne lias the only other out
standing role, that of a disillusioned
atheist. Making himself up as Shaw
was an extremely effective stage
trick, but detracted considerably
from the role and probably resulted
in a somewhat lal.se interpretation.
To identify Shaw with one of the
characters, when he is speaking
through all of them, and especially
through the Burglar, is to cause un
necessary confusion.
The play is an interesting freak,
but well worth seeing. To hear Barry
Jones speak the epilogue recom
penses the boring interludes.

TOO TRUE TO HE CiOOD (Shaw).
At the Columbia Theatre.
Shaw's plays have showed a steady
progression away from drama. The
present play tries to do several
things as impossible as any Shaw
has before attempted, but his usually
tine dramatic sense fails partly, and
the resulting play is an odd mixture
of incoherent fragments. Plot is al
most entirely dispensed with, being
even less important than in a revue.
There is no consistent attention to
any idea, or even set of ideas; the
characters are poorly defined, incon
sistent, arranged with little sense for
dramatic contrast.
A brief preface by Shaw given in
the program would indicate that his
main theme is the ideas of pleasure
through reckless excess produced by
the war and the reaction to such
ideas by the coming generation. An
other statement of theme comes in
the magnificent epilogue, where we
hear in a new way the somewhat
old idea of futility, the war's shat
tering of ideals, and the conflict of
man's desire for idealism with this.
There are several other keynote
speeches, notably one in which a be
liever in Newtonian determinism
shows the shattering of his fixed
ideas by modern science. There is a
speech by the Sergeant containing
some of Shaw's most bitter remarks
against war; another speech—the
Burglar's—makes cynical comments
on respectability and reiterates the
theme of Major Barbara that pov
erty itself is a vice.
From this may be gathered thai
"Too True To Be Good" is a series
of fragments, some of high quality,

but poorly tied together. This belief
is further substantiated when one
recognizes in Private Meek, who
dominates the second act but has
nothing to do with the play, a flat
tering representation of Col. T. E.
Lawrence.
This first act is pure farce, slow
moving, and stating nothing. The
only novelty is the introduction of
a Microbe; whatever purpose this
was supposed to serve is not clear.
Possibly Shaw wanted someone to
comment on the action, but very
few of the Microbe's speeches serve
this result. Its only important line
is the curtain speech, announcing
that the play Is over, and the char
acters will discuss it for two more
acts.
The second and third acts are
more episodic in character, but move
more rapidly and contain all the
fragments of ideas that Shaw has
put into the play.
As regards the acting of this
strange product, all honors go to
Barry Jones as the Burglar. The play
is hardly a good acting vehicle, but
the many changes of mood and the

long speeches require an accom
plished actor to hold an audience.
These requirements Jones met per
fectly. But as the part has no char
acter of its own Jones was also able
to add much, and the resulting char
acterization was similar to his roles
in "The Queen's Husband" and
"Arms and the Man."
Colbourne lias the only other out
standing role, that of a disillusioned
atheist. Making himself up as Shaw
was an extremely effective stage
trick, but detracted considerably
from the role and probably resulted
in a somewhat lal.se interpretation.
To identify Shaw with one of the
characters, when he is speaking
through all of them, and especially
through the Burglar, is to cause un
necessary confusion.
The play is an interesting freak,
but well worth seeing. To hear Barry
Jones speak the epilogue recom
penses the boring interludes.
