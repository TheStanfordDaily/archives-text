WELL. IF TIIE TWO basket
ball games in L.A. this past
week-end are any criterion of
what we may expect when the
Trojans come up here, the Farm
will witness a pair of games that
will even put last year's battles
to shame.
The high-scoring Lee Guttero
showed his sophomore standing by
failing to live up to pre-conference
expectations, but the veteran Jerry
Nemer as usual led the scorers.
From what little we can gather,
the team that "won't win a confer
ence game" is a pretty fair outfit,
] and should put on a swell battle
| with U.C.L.A. when the Bruins come
I up here next month.
It certainly is something to see
John Hancock leading the Indian
scorers. The big guard has just be
; gun to use his size to the best ad
vantage. He ought to be one of the
i outstanding guards in the confer-
I ence, with this added polish and the
i improvement that his scoring eye
seems to have undergone.
DROPPED OUT TO WATCH the
interclass water polo matches last
Saturday, and renewed an opinion
that we have had for some time
concerning this delightful sport—
that it is a swell game—for them
that likes it. How a man can
stay under water as long as most of
the polo players do. and still be able
to rise up and throw the ball out of
! the pool, is something that we have
given up trying to understand.
Anyhow, it was nice to see the
sophomores win (from a Stanford
1 angle that is) and to know that the
Cardinal supi'emacy in this sport is
not in danger yet.
California is likely to start
having formidable teams again,
now that they have acquired A1
Dowden from Fullcrton. lie
turned out winning outfits there
with startling regularity.
THIS IDEA OF STARTING
RUGBY r AGAIN seems to be
gaining some force in this end
of the state. It is rather humor
ous that Stanford should have
been the first college in the
United States to play rugby, and

now finds itself faced with the
necessity of "following" the East,
as usual, in the resumption of
the game.
Be that as it may, Stanford could
get up a fine team, and it might help
the football team. Who knows?*

given up trying to understand.
Anyhow, it was nice to see the
sophomores win (from a Stanford

Cardinal supi'emacy in this sport is

California is likely to start

THIS IDEA OF STARTING
RUGBY r AGAIN seems to be
gaining some force in this end
of the state. It is rather humor
ous that Stanford should have
been the first college in the
United States to play rugby, and

necessity of "following" the East,
as usual, in the resumption of
the game.
Be that as it may, Stanford could
get up a fine team, and it might help
the football team. Who knows?*

WELL. IF TIIE TWO basket
ball games in L.A. this past
week-end are any criterion of
what we may expect when the
Trojans come up here, the Farm
will witness a pair of games that
will even put last year's battles
to shame.
The high-scoring Lee Guttero
showed his sophomore standing by
failing to live up to pre-conference
expectations, but the veteran Jerry
Nemer as usual led the scorers.
From what little we can gather,
the team that "won't win a confer
ence game" is a pretty fair outfit,
] and should put on a swell battle
| with U.C.L.A. when the Bruins come
I up here next month.
It certainly is something to see
John Hancock leading the Indian
scorers. The big guard has just be
; gun to use his size to the best ad
vantage. He ought to be one of the
i outstanding guards in the confer-
I ence, with this added polish and the
i improvement that his scoring eye
seems to have undergone.
DROPPED OUT TO WATCH the
interclass water polo matches last
Saturday, and renewed an opinion
that we have had for some time
concerning this delightful sport—
that it is a swell game—for them
that likes it. How a man can
stay under water as long as most of
the polo players do. and still be able
to rise up and throw the ball out of
! the pool, is something that we have
given up trying to understand.
