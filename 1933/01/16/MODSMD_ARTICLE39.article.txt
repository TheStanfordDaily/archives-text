# CARD FROSH CAGERS DOWN BALBOA, SACRAMENTO J.C.
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team won two victories over the
week-end, playing bad basketball in
defeating Balboa High School on
Friday, 24-13, and looking brilliant
Saturday night in nosing out Sacra
mento Junior College, 24-22.
Don Greenlee, the same lad that
cost Stanford many points in the
season's opening brace of games,
was the power behind the Indian
attack in the team's third and fourth
contests. Against Balboa Greenlee
scored ten points to earn high-point
honors. On Saturday night he dupli
cated this performance exactly.
First String Guards
Saturday night's game saw Syd
Rosenberg, forward, and Dave Far
ber, guard, promoted to first-string
berths, replacing Wallace Brooke 1
and Don Maentz. Rosenberg's scrap
py play and Farber's smooth ball
handling were features of the two
game series. Tomorrow night's game
with Galileo High School will de
termine whether these promotions
are permanent or not.

Friday's game with Balboa was
marked by the worst playing and
the worst refereeing seen in the
Pavilion this season. Highly strung
and nervous because of events of
the afternoon, the freshmen passed
miserably, arched long shots that
didn't even touch the backboard, and
missed countless set-ups.
Complicating matters, the Indians
were penalized for walking each
time they attempted a fast break.
Score at the quarter was tied, 3-3,
with Stanford leading 9-5 at half
time. Balboa played a senseless
brand of basketball, yet kept in the
running until the last five 'minutes
of play when a series of brilliantly
executed plays by Don Greenlee
gave the Papooses a commanding
lead.
The Sacramento victory provided
one of the biggest upsets of the sea
son. The Capital City quintet had
covered itself with glory the night
before by holding Olson's Terrible
Swedes, one of.the strong contenders
