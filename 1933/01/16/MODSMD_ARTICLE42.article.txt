### WILLARD BUNGAY 
Under cloudy skies, which threat-,
ened to drench the spectators at any
moment, the sophomore interclass
water polo team won the finals of
the annual tank tournament by de
feating the juniors 4 to 1 at Encina
Pools Saturday.
With five first-string varsity men
in their lineup, the second-year men
outpassed and outshot their oppon
ents, besides being much stronger
on defense. At one time, when Dick
Hirsch, star sophomore forward, was
ruled out of the tank on a foul, his
teammates repulsed a strong junior
attack and scored the goal that put
him back in the water.
Outstanding for the winners were
Vlad Taranik, guard, Leo Cooke,
who played a very strong game at
goal, and the entire forward wall
which included Jimmy Benet, Jimmy
Triolo, and Dick Hirsch.
For the losers, Ted Wiget, star
varsity guard who scored the only

goal, stood head and shoulders above
his teammates. He left little doubt
in the minds of the spectators that
he will again be one of the outstand
ing players on the Pacific Coast.
In a preliminary game between
the freshmen and seniors to decide
third and fourth places, the upper
classmen, after trailing ; t half-time,
won 5 to 2. The juniors had defeated
the seniors Friday, 9 to 2, to make
them eligible to play in the finals.
No one player was particularly
predominant among the seniors, but
Captain De Myers practically led the
freshman attack single-handed.
