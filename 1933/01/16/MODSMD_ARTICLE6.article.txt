# Sunnyvale Air Base Assumes Novel Aspect
## 
### John Kline 
While final work on the U.S.S.
Macon, giant sister ship to the
Akron, which visited the coast a
year ago, is being rushed in Ohio,
its permanent base at Sunnyvale is
also nearly finished. The Macon is
pictured above.
Sunnyvale naval air base, lying
only ten miles from the Stanford
campus, was a bare plain fifteen
months ago. It now represents a very
contrasting appearance as the stu
pendous hangar and attendant struc
tures assume shape.
Gigantic Hangar
Of special design and construc
tion, the hangar itself is an imposing
sight. Measuring 1123 feet in length,
314 feet in width, and 194 feet high,
it is of gigantic proportions. The ex
terior, although looking like steel,
is made of "asbestos protective
metal" and is placed on a skeleton
of structural steel.
New Types Utilized
The four tremendous "orange
peel" doors which enclose the hang
ar at two ends are mounted on
standard guage railroad track; each
requires a one-hundred-horsepower
automatic electric motor for its
operation.
Inside the almost fireproof and
earthquake-proof "home" for the
Macon are seven. lines of catwalks
for access to various parts of the
ship, hoists for supplies or repair
work, and a large mezzanine floor.
In addition to the hangar, an ad
ministration building, barracks, a
dispensary, and a recreation build
ing containing everything from bar
ber shops to a chaplain for the well
being of the crew, are now fully
completed.
The new type mooring mast is also
ready for the arrival of the new
"pride of the navy." It is mounted on
twin sets of railroad tracks set 80
feet apart, and has a weight variable
in the range between 77 to 160 feet.
Huge Helium Tanks
Helium tanks holding 3.000,000
cubic feet have now been installed
at the base, with additional tanks
to raise the total capacity to eight
million to be built in the near fu
ture. The Macon holds 6,500,000
cubic feet when entirely filled.
Approximately mx hundred fifty
men will comprise the human por
tion of the establishment required
for maintenance of the world's larg
est dirigible.
