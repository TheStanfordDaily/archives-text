# OPERETTA SEEN AS POSSIBILITY
## Theatre Fund Committee Meets Today 
### 
The Theatre Fund Committee, re
cently appointed under the A.S.S.U.
constitution by President Bill Cor
bus, and composed of representa
tives of varying groups of campus
opinion, meets at 5 o'clock today in
the Old Union.
Following in the wake of campus
protest started by the announcement
that the annual Junior Opera was
to go by the boards, is the move
ment to be considered by the com
mittee in response to student de
mand for a lighter and more profit
able substitute.
At today's meeting, discussion is
expected to hinge on the advisa
bility of producing an operetta of
Gilbert and Sullivan nature, or a
musical comedy such as "Good
News" in the spring quarter. A pre
liminary canvass of committee mem
bers by the Daily show them to be
heartily in favor of such a plan.
A sentiment' held by many was
aptly expressed by Mary Anita Loos
when she stated that there was need
for entertainment in a vein light
enough to appeal to the whole stu
dent body instead of only true lovers
of legitimate drama.
