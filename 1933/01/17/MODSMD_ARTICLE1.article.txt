# OLYMPIC CLUB CAGERS OPPOSE CARDS TONIGHT
## Former Stanford Players To Wear Winged 'O' In Pavilion VISITORS ARE FAVORED Bunn May Give Reserves Chance To Start 
### 
Backed with confidence after put
ting up two great battles against
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, America's greatest school of
athletics. Coach John Bunn's Stan
lord basketball team bumps up
against a combination of former
Cardinal and California players
wearing the Olympic Club colors
here tonight.
The locals are in for a hard eve
ning and stand a strong chance of
yielding to the tricks of the trade as
displayed by A1 Norgard and Bill
Doub, regulars here last season, and
Joe Kintana and Carl Vendt, a cou
ple of ex-Bears who did Stanford
dirt during the past three seasons.
Russ Hamin, a forward and fifth man
of the Winged O quintet, has done
quite a little basketballing himself,
and last year gavd the San Fran
cisco Young Men's Institute more
than one victory with his spectacu
lar shooting.
Card Lineup Uncertain
What Burin plans to use tonight
is only opinion. He originally had
plans to use a starting combination
which would include at least one
man who has not seen action this
season Palmer Fuller. Fuller was
fuller the dickens during practices j
last week and rolled up a mass of
points against the regulars in two j
tough scrimmages.
It is likely that he will be in there, '
with maybe George Griffin at the
ether forward. Keith Topping will
probably start at center to serve as j
a dependable scoring and passing .
unit that can hold the others to- i
gether. Tod and Hancock, it appears, J
will handle the guard work until j
Bunn is able to size up the situation j
and substitute accordingly.
Leaving Captain Tom Cordry on j
the bench, if that is done, will give I
Stanford an ace in the hole. His ;
scoring ability would give the Car- j
dinals a needed punch if the set-up !
is right.
Bunn has reason for considering i
two reserves for starting posts to
night. Playing against a club team
wil Inot cost them any year of com
petition and it will serve the pur
pose of testing them under fire.
Never a weak team, the club this i
season presents a seasoned group of
campaigners which can hold its own
against the best. Although several of
last year's best—Frank Wilson, Cal
Boberg, Okberg, etc. —are playing
with different clubs, the Post Street- I
ers will be odcLs-on favorites at tip- I
I
off time tonight.
Vendt and Norgard are both over j
six feet. They guard well and con
tribute a fair share of the offensive.
Doub, who finished his college career ]
here last quarter after playing a j
bang-up football season at end, will
be holding down his old position at j
center. His passing has been his best 1
feature so far, reports indicate. The !
two forwards are both deadeyes. j
Hamm is not. very big, but loops j
long ones easily. Kintana gained j
fame last season with his sensational
one-handed shots.
