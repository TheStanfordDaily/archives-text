That the Farm's canoes and bath
ing suits will not be kissed by the
water sof Lagunita during the spring
days of 1933, was indicated by rain
fall figures released yesterday by
Cecil Killingsworth, ground water
engineer for the University.
No less than a miniature cloud
burst, Killingsworth pointed out,
will send the murky water of San
Francisquito creek swirling into the
basin that is Lagunita. The gauge at
the Corporation Yard yesterday read
3.07 inches for the season's rain. On
January 15, 1932, the guage showed
a total of 11.57 inches for the season,
and in 1931, a year when the cam
pus lagoon remained dry, if road

5.73.
Before Lagunita may grow to
sizeable proportions, a rainfall of
from 3 to 5 inches within a 36-hour
period must occur. Water from light
er rains extending over longer
periods will not benefit the lake, but
will soak into the campus acres or
flow down to the bay.
Searsville and Felt lakes, Stan
ford's more reliable reservoirs, have
also suffered from the sparse rain
fall of this season. Searsville, with a
capacity of 305,000,000 gallons, con
tains only 92.000,000 gallons at the
present time, and Felt lake, with a
capacity of 320,000,000 gallons, has
fallen to 98,000,000 gallons,
