# Two More Held Guilty Of Honor Code Violations
## Suspensions by Men's Council Now Total Six Since Opening of School Last Quarter; Illegal Parking of Autos Is Scored 
### 
TWO more students stand suspended from Stanford for violations of the
honor code, i( was announced l»y Gilbert Carr, chairman of the Men's
Council, after yesterday's session. Both were found guilt,\ of cheating
during the auaumn quarter and have heen expelled for three quarters,
Carr said. Six students have now suffered from the council's rulings since
the opening of classes last October.
The first ease yesterday concerned a man enrolled in a laboratory course;
who used his roommate's corrected papers to get a high grade. He let his
turn in papers first, and

then drew his conclusions on the
basis of the corrected report.
Although the student concerned
in the other case did not register
this term, his arguments were re
ceived by latter and found wanting.
He inadvertently turned in a-"pony"
instead of his regular work during
a final examination.
Parking violaters drew severe
criticism from the council and $1
fines for leaving automobiles in
wrong locations near the postofTice.
Four men were found guilty.
All gave excuses that the "no
parking" signs were improperly
placed, but the council did not heed
the alibi. Carr issued a warning to
all campus motorists to observe
parking rules near the post office.
He said that autoists would have to
look before they park or suffer the
consequences.
Carr pointed out that the case in
volving the student borrowing lab
oratory work gives rise to a common
situation on the campus that is not
clearly understood by the students.
Seriousness Not Felt
"The council feels," he said, "that
some of the students do not realize
the seriousness of copying others'
Work in lab courses. While it is gen
erally permissable for two or three
men to work together on experi
ments, it is not fair for one of them
to let the others work out the prob
lems and then copy the paper.
"We hope that this point is clear
to members of the various classes
and that no further violations will
be reported."
