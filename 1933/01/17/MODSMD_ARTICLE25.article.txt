## Former Stars Offer Their Coaching Services 
### Bob Letts 
Rugby, the gridiron game which
gave way to American football
slightly over a decade ago, will at
tempt a comeback on the Stanford
campus tonight when a group of
alumni stars will meet at 7:15 o'clock
to discuss the project. All interested
students, whether graduates or un
dergraduates, are invited.
Need for an outdoor sport during
the winter months and the strong
appeal that the game formerly had
were cited as reasons for the move
by Norman Cleaveland, former
American football star and member
of the 1924 United States rugby
squad that won the world's cham
pionship in the Paris Olympic
Games.
Cleaveland, with Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports here, and a
group of alumni, has volunteered his
services to the Board of Athletic
Control, if that body feels itself
financially able to support the new
activity.
Others who will attend the meet
ing include "Seotchy" Campbell,
former quarterback and captain ol
the 1924 Stanford American team;
Phil Clark, who competed on the
1924 United States rugby team; Jim
Wylie of Mountain View, who is re
garded as one of the greatest rugby
men ever to play and who was a
member of the famous New Zealand
All-Blacks, and "Dink" Templeton,
Stanford track coach who was a
member of the 1924 world's cham
pions.
Teams are being formed in San
Francisco by the Olympic Club, Shell
Oil Company, and the Wanderers,
an independent outfit. Some of the
initiative there is also marked by
the Stanford group's efforts, and
games will be arranged between the
clubs during the latter part of the
quarter.
