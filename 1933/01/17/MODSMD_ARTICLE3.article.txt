# LESLEY TO TOUR EUROPE TONIGHT
## Verbal Trip Conducted In Little Theatre 
### 
"Three Months in Europe" with
Stanford Professor Everett Parker
Lesley is the program scheduled for
the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. Having just returned from
the depression-ridden Continent, Dr.
Lesley has observed the manner in
which Europeans are bearing the
economic strain.
Active in aeronautic circles since
the World War Professor Lesley is
head of the Stanford Guggenheim
Laboratory. In the course of his
travels he visited several aero-dy
namic experimental laboratories.
Lesley did not stay for active work,
however, since the trip was mainly
for pleasure.
The verbal excursion tonight will
include stops in England, Scotland,
Belgium, Holland, and Germany. In
the latter country the professor vis
ited the University of Goettingen
and the picturesque University of
Heidelberg.
Lesley remarked on the extraor
dinary courage of the people of Eu
rope. He found that conditions were
worse than they are here, though
the people talked less about their
woes. The outward signs of hard
times are, for the most part, lacking.
Beggars are scarce; soup kitchens
are rare.
