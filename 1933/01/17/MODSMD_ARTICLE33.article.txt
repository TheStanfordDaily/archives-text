# NO LAKE
## 
### 
Marring a deluge, a cloudburst, or some other form of
heaven-sent blessing, there will be no Lagunitu this spring.
Looking into the "fair and colder future, it is rather hard
to picture what Stanford life will be this April, Mav and
.lunc\ without the traditional Lake.
Fraternity sophomores will be spared the irksome task
of painting the house canoe. Their uppcrclass brothers
will be denied the privilege of loaning it to friends at Roblc
niid in the sororities, and the occasional pleasure of pad
dling themselves across the scummy surface. The Junior
Water Carnival, planned annually for the Lake, will be
held, as usual, in the Kncina pools.
No more sunbaths on the galvanized rafts. No more
water-splashed portable phonographs. No more sudden,
entirely unprovoked capsixals and immersions. No more
spectacular dives from the boathouse platform. No more
warm afternoons in the canoe bottom.
Mut, as a Pollyanna might add, no more breeding place
for mosquitoes and gnats.
