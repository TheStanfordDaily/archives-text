# REMOTE CONTROL JUSTICE
## 
### 
Two more students have been "tired'" by the vigilant, j
justice-meting Men's Council. The Council has now ex
panded its jurisdiction to a point where it can punish
Honor ('ode violations by remote control. One of these two j
latest violators was convicted and sentenced to suspension
from the I niversity at a time when he was not even regis
tered. The man in question "took the rap" from the Coun
cil for turning in his "pony" in place of his exam paper.
There ought to be a separate penalty for such stupidity.
The Men's Council has proved again that it means busi
ness with regard to the Honor Code. The more suspension
penalties inflicted the better, these days. The time may
yet arrive when the success of the honor system may be
judged by the iul'requency of violations and penalties. Hut
until that Utopian state of affairs comes to pass the status
of the Honor Code on the campus must be .measured by
the severity and frequency of the Council's convictions and
suspensions.
