# BULL SESSION
## OFF TO A DESERT ISLE 
### 
If a reporter were suddenly to
spring from behind this typewriter
and blurt: ''What two books would
you take with you to a desert isle,
Mr. Mellinkoff?" my answer would
be one of two things. If I were in a
minxy mood and had not been too
startled by the unusual phenomena
of a Daily reporter popping out at
me, I would pass off the whole mat
ter with some simple quip like "I
hadn't planned any desert isle ex
cursions" or "That's as personal as
the location of my birth mark and
I don't divulge either."
More probably, however, I would
have answered: "The Bible and
Shakespeare." At least that's what
I most of the greats who happened to
be at home when the Daily phoned
last Friday answered. There is
nothing novel in that answer. It is
| as customary as mud on the west
approach to the Libe.
This being so, it has long been ac
cepted that the Bible and Shakes
peare are the two greatest, most be
| loved, most valuable, most read
books in the English language. And
from this, it is only a short and na
tural American step to set these two
venerables down as the tw ogreatest
in the world. And if challenged to
name two others, I would immedi
ately confess my inability to do so
as the most effective check to a
long, uninteresting, and pointless
argument.
But my inability would not prove
the veracity of the Gargantuan halos
that have been hoisted over these>
two works. When asked to choose a
two-volume reading list for a life
time stay on some deserted island,
one immediately thinks of bulk. We
: want lots to read. The first reaction
is the "City Telephone Book." That
; is discarded when 2,000 pages of
' Shakespeare looms on the mental 1

horizon. And all in one book. Won
derful.
The Bible also scores on the bulk
argument—especially when we con
sider Old and New Testaments
jammed into one volume. If it were
ever printed in readable type, it
would probably outweigh even
Shakespeare by half a pound. Then
there is a moral and social compul
sion which also motivates in the se
lection of the Bible. Though very
vevw ever , look at the Bible outside
of Sunday Services and New Testa
ment Lit classes, it has embedded
itself in the accepted picture of re
spectability like fireplaces, gray
haired mothers, grandfather's clocks,
etc.
Then, too, in selecting our two
printed companions for this foray
into complete insular solitude, we
picture ourselves with nothing to do
and years to do it. We ignore the
almost positive certainty of dying
off during the first winter, and in
stead demand that our two books
keep us amused for an indefinite
number of years. It seems an eter?
nity—the death-expectancy being
unpleasant;
We know that the most interesting
books pall after, say, three readings.
We therefore demand something so
vague, obscure, involved, and con
tradictory that countless re-readings
will never completely untangle the
problems; and make certain the un
certainties. For obvious reasons, the
Bible and Shakespeare meet this de
mand to perfection.
And yet no person nt confronted
with the possibility of an endless
number of years in complete soli
tude would say that bulk, respecta
bility, and vagueness are the three
requirements of literature.

More probably, however, I would
have answered: "The Bible and
Shakespeare." At least that's what
I most of the greats who happened to
be at home when the Daily phoned
last Friday answered. There is
nothing novel in that answer. It is
| as customary as mud on the west
approach to the Libe.
This being so, it has long been ac
cepted that the Bible and Shakes
peare are the two greatest, most be
| loved, most valuable, most read
books in the English language. And
from this, it is only a short and na
tural American step to set these two
venerables down as the tw ogreatest
in the world. And if challenged to
name two others, I would immedi
ately confess my inability to do so
as the most effective check to a
long, uninteresting, and pointless
argument.
But my inability would not prove
the veracity of the Gargantuan halos
that have been hoisted over these>
two works. When asked to choose a
two-volume reading list for a life
time stay on some deserted island,
one immediately thinks of bulk. We
: want lots to read. The first reaction
is the "City Telephone Book." That
; is discarded when 2,000 pages of
' Shakespeare looms on the mental 1

horizon. And all in one book. Won
derful.
The Bible also scores on the bulk
argument—especially when we con
sider Old and New Testaments
jammed into one volume. If it were
ever printed in readable type, it
would probably outweigh even
Shakespeare by half a pound. Then
there is a moral and social compul
sion which also motivates in the se
lection of the Bible. Though very
vevw ever , look at the Bible outside
of Sunday Services and New Testa
ment Lit classes, it has embedded
itself in the accepted picture of re
spectability like fireplaces, gray
haired mothers, grandfather's clocks,
etc.
Then, too, in selecting our two
printed companions for this foray
into complete insular solitude, we
picture ourselves with nothing to do
and years to do it. We ignore the
almost positive certainty of dying
off during the first winter, and in
stead demand that our two books
keep us amused for an indefinite
number of years. It seems an eter?
nity—the death-expectancy being
unpleasant;
We know that the most interesting
books pall after, say, three readings.
We therefore demand something so
vague, obscure, involved, and con
tradictory that countless re-readings
will never completely untangle the
problems; and make certain the un
certainties. For obvious reasons, the
Bible and Shakespeare meet this de
mand to perfection.
And yet no person nt confronted
with the possibility of an endless
number of years in complete soli
tude would say that bulk, respecta
bility, and vagueness are the three
requirements of literature.

If a reporter were suddenly to
spring from behind this typewriter

you take with you to a desert isle,
Mr. Mellinkoff?" my answer would
be one of two things. If I were in a
minxy mood and had not been too
startled by the unusual phenomena
of a Daily reporter popping out at
me, I would pass off the whole mat

hadn't planned any desert isle ex

the location of my birth mark and
I don't divulge either."
