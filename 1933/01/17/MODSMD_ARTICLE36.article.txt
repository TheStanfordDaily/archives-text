FRISCO JENNIE (Warners)—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Something called Frisco Jennie is
current at the Stanford; its star is
Miss Ruth Chatterton. The chief
reason that I did not go to see the
film is the fact that its plot concerns
the unknowing son of a Barbary
i Coast fancy lady who, becoming a
j district attorney, tries his mother
I for murder.
So many pictures with an almost
identical plot ("Madame X," "Scar
let Pages") have appeared during
the last several years—all unmodi
fied versions of a long line of stage
predecessors—that there seems very
J little reason to comment upon it,
Miss Ruth Chatterton is starred;
j she has been repeating one charac
terization now for some time—what
-1 ever her role. That is an added rea
son for selecting another picture to
j see. — Sandoe
THE MASK OF FU MANCHU
(Metro) —At the Varsity Theatre.
Metro had a terrific time trying to
I find a sufficiently horrible final se
quence for this film; the pother was
unnecessary—the film should have
been scrapped.
In it the Oriental dignity of the
j wicked doctor is flat rather than
j oily and as exaggerated as the
heroics and the horror. When the
hero, strapped down by the villain,
suggests that he doesn't care at all
that Love Is Supreme, and calls
upon the Doctor to stop before he
| summons the entire British Army,
, when doors slide mysteriously open
to the accompaniment of gongs and
glass xylophones, when brave Nay
land Smith wriggles out of badly
tied bonds to effect a last-minute
release — appearing only human
rather than ingenious—the flavor of
the unnatural (which the producers
have striven terrifically to maintain)
and the atmosphere of extreme dig

nity carried to extremes do not hor
rify—they become ludicrous.

(Tonight the Varsity management
is presenting Sous Los Toits de
Parjs, a French film directed by
Rene Clair, said to be France's finest
director, is by no means as adept
as, for example, Lubitsch or Mamou
lian. The film will be of interest to
students of French. It is light-heart
ed comedy with songs.)
