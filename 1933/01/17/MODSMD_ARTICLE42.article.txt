# CAMPUS OPINION
## IT'S A CINCH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With much regret I read in this
morning's Daily of the official ding
ing of the Junior Opera. As a move
in the right direction I think that it
it> a wrung one. The Junior Opera
has its place among Stanford life
and traditions as much as do jolly
ups, the Ram's Head Gaieties, the
bonfire, etc. To abolish it completely
is as much bad taste as would be
smoking in the Memorial Chapel.
We have the chief reason for this
•committee's out-of-turn action as
being that the Opera as such is a
lot of drivel and a huge financial
flop. I question the first criticism
as always being true. And I cer
tainly think that Stanford has
enough talent to produce a good
musical show. Other schools can,
why not us? In fact, we have. Per
haps a hint to the Daily to drop its
slightly childish policy of sophisti
cation and cynicism in all its review
and editorials dealing with the Opera
would help. After all, I have yet to
see an Opera (and I have seen five)
that did not entertain the audience.
But we are beside the point.
Everyone, I believe, will admit that
the Opera is a good tradition, and
provides a good field of activity for
those who aspire to writing, acting,
and composing. And I'm sure that
some one here can write a good
show. Well—why not the following:
We have a Theatre Fund under
way, and a newly appointed Theatre

Fund committee. And we want some
way of putting this Theatre Fund
over. If the Opera, as a Junior Class
protege, was abolished, and a simi
lar show taken over by the Theatre
Fund committee, it would certainly
be due for a success —financially and
otherwise. We would not be bur
dened with a Theatre Fund Follies,
which is' merely a Gaieties under
another name, and we would still
have our old pal—although decked
out in a new coat. And with the
Theatre Fund committee opening the
deal, the campus interested in get
ting money for that new theatre, and
the Daily closing the deal with a
little favorable publicity—it's a
cinch. Why not?
Sincerely,

ups, the Ram's Head Gaieties, the
bonfire, etc. To abolish it completely
is as much bad taste as would be
smoking in the Memorial Chapel.
We have the chief reason for this
•committee's out-of-turn action as
being that the Opera as such is a
lot of drivel and a huge financial
flop. I question the first criticism
as always being true. And I cer
tainly think that Stanford has
enough talent to produce a good
musical show. Other schools can,
why not us? In fact, we have. Per
haps a hint to the Daily to drop its
slightly childish policy of sophisti
cation and cynicism in all its review
and editorials dealing with the Opera
would help. After all, I have yet to
see an Opera (and I have seen five)
that did not entertain the audience.
But we are beside the point.
Everyone, I believe, will admit that
the Opera is a good tradition, and
provides a good field of activity for
those who aspire to writing, acting,
and composing. And I'm sure that
some one here can write a good
show. Well—why not the following:
We have a Theatre Fund under
way, and a newly appointed Theatre

Fund committee. And we want some
way of putting this Theatre Fund
over. If the Opera, as a Junior Class
protege, was abolished, and a simi
lar show taken over by the Theatre
Fund committee, it would certainly
be due for a success —financially and
otherwise. We would not be bur
dened with a Theatre Fund Follies,
which is' merely a Gaieties under
another name, and we would still
have our old pal—although decked
out in a new coat. And with the
Theatre Fund committee opening the
deal, the campus interested in get
ting money for that new theatre, and
the Daily closing the deal with a
little favorable publicity—it's a
cinch. Why not?
Sincerely,
Gordon Heche, '32
