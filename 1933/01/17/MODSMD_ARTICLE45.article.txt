Sacramento Squad Starts
Jimmy Bradshaw will probably
art the same team tonight that did
i well against Sacramento Junior
ollege: Don Greenlee, center; Ralph
lannion and Syd Rosenberg, for
arcLs; Addie Barnett and Dave
arber, guards. Wally Brook? may
place Rosenberg at one of the for
■ards, but Fcrbcr seems to have
isplaced Don Maentz from his back
uard position. Farber is a better
(Tensive player than Maentz, al
lough not quite as accurate on long
lots. Reserves who may see action
might include Viguie and Trorn
as, forwards, and Bergman, a
uard.
I'aly High Threat

haw with his last opportunity to
0 any experimenting before the
ist Little Big Game Saturday night.
vMiile Stanford was upsetting Sacra

old Junior College easily, running
p a high score largely on the basis
1 dead-eye shooting by forward
Jightingale. who rang the hoop for
ineteen points.
Menlo Junior College and Palo
vlto High, future Papoose oppon
nts, won impressive victories over
lie week-end. The latter team in
articular promises to give Stanford
rough evening. Using reserve
jlayers during two-thirds of the
nine, Palo Alto defeated South San
rancisco, 40-9. The annual Stati
on! freshman-Paly High seuies
tands as a 100 per cent record for

arcLs; Addie Barnett and Dave
arber, guards. Wally Brook? may
place Rosenberg at one of the for
■ards, but Fcrbcr seems to have
isplaced Don Maentz from his back
uard position. Farber is a better
(Tensive player than Maentz, al
lough not quite as accurate on long
lots. Reserves who may see action
might include Viguie and Trorn
as, forwards, and Bergman, a
uard.

haw with his last opportunity to
0 any experimenting before the

vMiile Stanford was upsetting Sacra
lento, the Bear Cubs beat Bakers
old Junior College easily, running
p a high score largely on the basis
