# FRESHMAN BATSMEN DISPLAY TALENT IN WORKOUT AGAINST VARSITY RESERVES
## 
### 
While the varsity regulars went
through a stiff workout under the
critical eye of Coach Harry Wolter
yesterday on the varsity ball field,
the rest of the squad took on Coach
Murray Cuddeback's freshman wil
low-wielders in the first practice
game of the year, and emerged ori
top by a comfrotable margin.
Objects of the most careful scru
tiny were yearling pitchers Don
Clark and George Franceschi, the
latter a portsider. Clark has a slow,
side-arm delivery that had most of
the regulars swinging ahead of the
ball, but lack of practice prevented
him from showing anything excep
tional. Franceschi showed fair con
trol and the natural inside curve
possessed by most left-handed
chuckers, but neither of them seemed
to have the sort of speed shown
by last year's freshman Fred Her
inger.
The most-polished work both on
offense and defense was shown by
first-baseman Bobby Grayson, who
handles himself nicely, and looks
like the backbone of the team right
now.

At second, Cuddeback had Frank
Tremaine, a youngster with good
fielding possibilities, who will have
to improve his hitting; while over
on third base was "Bones" Hamil
ton, a nice combination with Gray
son in football and giving promise
of an equally nice one on the ball
field. Hamilton's play needs a lot of
work, but it will undoubtedly be
good enough to rate him the posi
tion.
In the outfield the freshman coach
has unearthed a pair of capable men
in "Monk"' Moscrip and John Mack
roth. Moscrip poled one of Savinski's
offerings for four bases his first trip
to the plate. His fielding, either
through choice or ability, can stand
plenty of improvement. Maekroth
provided the fielding features of the
game with a couple of nice catches.
He starts as the ball leaves the bat,
and seems to have a good eye, which
is something that past frosh teams
have needed but seldom had.
With a little more help for the
infield, and someone to bolster up
the pitching corps, Cuddeback has
the makings of a first-class fresh
man team.

plenty of improvement. Maekroth
provided the fielding features of the
game with a couple of nice catches.
He starts as the ball leaves the bat,
and seems to have a good eye, which
is something that past frosh teams
have needed but seldom had.
With a little more help for the
infield, and someone to bolster up
the pitching corps, Cuddeback has
the makings of a first-class fresh
man team.
