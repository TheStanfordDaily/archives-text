# Card Fencers Round Into Form For Saber Matches
## 
### 
Despite the absence this quarter
of Fred Pearnjan, considered by
Coach Elwyn Bugge as one of the
three best fencers on the team,
Stanford's sword-wielders are rap
idly reaching the form in which they
won the, Heron Trophy tournament
last November, and are at present
preparing for the Saber team cham
pionships scheduled tentatively for
January 27, here at Stanford.
Bugge, who is being aided by
Harry Maloney, will have potential
strength in Leonard Pock man, cap
tain and former Pacific Coast Junior
Saber champion, John Ferguson, A1
Snyder, Burnam Sheedy, Hubert
Chain, and Ed Munger.
