# RESUME WEEKLY ALL-STAR TRACK MEETS ON FRIDAY
## Sam Eastmans Work In Half â€“ Mile To Be Watched By Fans 
### 
Barring interference from the ele
ments this coming Friday afternoon
will see the resumption of that
familiar carnival of sports known
as the regular Friday track meets.
Varsity squad members as well as
the Class of '36 will have the chance
to display their competitive wares.
By his excellent time of 1:59.7 in
the half-mile in last week's mural
competition, Sam Eastman served
notice that he is determined this an
Eastman year in a double way. This
is a promising early season time,
and while not in a class with brother
Big Ben's world mark, shows that
the red-headed share of the Eastman
duo is on his way.
Phil Williams led the van of
broad-jumpers with a mark of
22'2'u" which is his best to date.
At the present this lad appears to
be supreme among a number of
mediocre hopefuls in the kangaroo
event. Paul Zaches took but one
jump and landed in second place,
being too busily engaged in the high
jump, javelin, etc., to try for a first
place. Zaches is a natural athlete,
with ability for the jump, who, if
he specialized, might add materially
to his distance.
A rabbit with horns on his head
1 was killed in Missouri.
