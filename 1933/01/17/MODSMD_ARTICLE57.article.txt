least one experienced man fighting
at every weight.

be held Thursday, February 2, in
the Pavilion with the preliminaries
being fought several days earlier.
Competition for all-University
crowns appears to be stronger than
usual this year, the battle for the
welterweight title promising to be
the toughest when Waldo Monday,
former Olympic Club boxer and
Pacific Coast welter champion, at
tempts to regain the honors lie lost
when Bob Quinn defeated him re
cently in the Stanford novice cham
pionship.
In the middlweight division an
other close scrap is expected when
Jack Perego, 1981 novice champion,
and John Fowler, 1932 novice title
holder,' tangle, while Oscar Baer
may upset either of them.
John Huston and Jim Feeling will
probably be the finalists in the
featherweight division. The former

University crown. The latter also
fought a draw with Bud Taylor,
Pacific Coast lightweight champ.
Captain Fred Glover, leading the
team for the second year, appears
to have things his own way in the
