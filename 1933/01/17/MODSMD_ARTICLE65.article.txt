### 
TOKYO, Jan. 16 </P>â€”A War Of
fice statement said today that China
is getting military supplies from
Americans, but a government spokes
man denied that Japan is contem
plating any protest to Washington.
Reports of an impending protest,
published in Japanese newspapers,
were "ridiculous," it was said at the
Foreign Office, as Americans and
other foreigners are fully within
their rights in selling arms to the
Chinese and in instructing them.
"A supply of arms to China, espe
cially to Chang Hsiao-liang (com
mander in North China) has been
made principally by the United
States and Germany, Americans
selling the Chinese army airplanes
and motor cars, mostly delivered in
Shanghai, and the Germans deliver
ing guns and machine guns to Tien
tsin," said a statement issued by the
War Office.
Acting on instructions from Secre
tary of State Stimson, United States
Ambassador Grew issued a formal
denial.
