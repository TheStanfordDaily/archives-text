### 
BERLIN, Jan. 10 (/P)â€”Political
circles so firmly believed today that
the country was headed for its third
Reichstag election within the last
seven months that the Cabinet even
discussed February 19 or February
26 as tentative dates.
- Advices from Weimar indicated
that Adolf Hitler, leader of the Na
tional Socialist Fascists, encouraged
by the success of his party in the
Lippe Diet election yesterday, had
decided to continue his "all or
nothing" policy.
