### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (/P) â€” A
possible preview of an expected
Presidential message on finances was
given tonight by Secretary Mills in
a speech which denounced as a
"tricky accounting device" leading
to ruinous consequences, the much
discussed plan of financing future
federal construction by long-time
bond issues.
He insisted that a manufacturers'
asels tax, already urged by himself
and the President, was the way to
balahce the 1934 budget, which now
faces a $613,000,000 deficit exclusive
of debt retirement. Mills added that
were it not for the political factors
involved, solution of the govern
ment's fiscal problems would be
comparatively simple.
Four women in Liverpool, Eng
land, have respectively 59, 73, 77,
and 80 descendants living.

Mrs. Helen WilLs Moody has aban
doned tournament tennis for the re
mainder of this year to devote her
self to art studies in Paris, France.
