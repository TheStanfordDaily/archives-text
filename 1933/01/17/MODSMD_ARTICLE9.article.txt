SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 16 (/Pi-
Attorney General U.S. Webb ruled
today that purchase of property at
a tax sale does not cancel any taxes,
other than those over which the land
was sold. Liens for other assess
ments or taxes, fte said, still stand
against the property, which may
again be sold to satisfy the remain
ing taxes unless paid.
