Presenting its only concert outside
San Francisco this season under the
direction of Bernardino Molinari,
noted Italian conductor, the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra will
appear in the Stanford Pavilion at
8:130 o'clock tonight, as the third at
traction of the 1932-33 A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series.
Molinari, who recently arrived in
the cily to fulfill an engagement as
guest conductor of the Bay City's
symphony, has been since 1912 con
ductor of the famous Augusteo Sym
phony Orchestra of Rome, appearing
all over the world as a guest con
ductor whenever his regular work
permitted.
Varied Program
Noted for (lie excellence of his
program selections as well as for his
symphonic arrangements and trans
cription, Molinari has chosen a re
pertoire of numbers of varied inter
est to appeal to every member of his
audience.
The opening selection will be :
Tschaikowsky's "Symphony Pathe
tique," number six, which is con- j
sidered by many one of (he greatest
symphonies of modern times and the (
only one of the latter half of the i
19th century which can be ranked
with Beethoven's best. The mood of j
the "Pathetique" is one of desperate
and hopeless struggle, concluding 1
with a pessimistic adagio lamentoso i
which is believed to have had a per- ;
sonal meaning to the composer j
whose death, or suicide, occurred a
short time later.
Musical "Arabian Nights"
The latter half of the program j
will include "The Festival at Bag
dad" from the Scheherazade Suite j
by Rimsky-Korsakov. This is a mu- j
sieal version of a part of the "Ara- '
bian Nights," ranked as one of the !
finest examples of musical story
telling ever written. The program j
will be concluded by Wagner's Over- j
ture to "Tanifhauser," built prinei- j
pally around the solemn "Pilgrim's !
Chorus."
