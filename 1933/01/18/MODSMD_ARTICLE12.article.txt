# INDIANS LOSE CAGE BATTLE TO OLYMPICS
## Kintana, Former Bear Star, Sinks Winning Basket In Final Rally 
### Bob Letts 
After giving a thousand spectators
weak hearts with narrowly missed
baskets as the game drew to a close,
Joe Kintana, former University of
; California star, handed the Olympic
Club a 37 to 35 victory over Stan
i ford's basketball team here last
night.
Making the winning bucket after
three Post Streeters had swooped
down with a fast break on Jay Tod,
the only Stanford man defending the
basket Kintana produced the finish
ing touch of a game lhat started
evenly and listlessly and finished in
a whirlwind of flying leather that
had a sparse crowd's yells rattling
the rafters.
Cards Take Early Lead
Coach John Bunn's quintet, with
Captain Tom Cordry and Carroll
Weaver, a new starter this year,
doing the damage, broke into an
early lead, and, after having it chal
lenged, ran up a 1!) to 8 margin with
but five minutes left in the half.
, Kintana swung into action then,
rang up six points as his contribu-
I tion, and helped put the Clubmen
â–  on even terms at. the intermission,
21 to 21.
Right back came the Cordry-
Weaver combination, and again the
Cardinals took a lead, this time of
29 to 22, in the first 10 minutes.
Kintana and Bill Force answered
with a pair of field goals, and Cordry
responded with two buckets for
Stanford.
Clubmen Switch Attack
Suddenly shifting to a fast-break
ing offense, the Olympic Club began
paring down the margin and got up
; to 28 to 33, when the game's mis
fortune occurred. John Hancock,
husky Indian guard, leaped into the
air to take a rebound shot off the
' backboard he was defending, but
the jump was mistimed and Han
cock accidentally tipped the ball
into the visitors' hoop. Carl Vendt,
another ex-Bear, followed with a
field goal to tie the count, 33 all, with
five minutes to go.
It was an open dogfight the rest
of the way, with Kintana finally
cracking through with less than a
half-minute to play remaining.
Inri ian Miss II Free Throws
Kintana and Cordry did the main
scoring, the Card leader taking the
honors with 17 to 15 for the Club
forward. Force, visiting center, was
next high with 10, being followed by
Weaver's nine and Keith Topping's
i seven. Topping played 'i good floor
I game, but seldom was in position
to shoot.
Stanford missed 11 out of 15
chances at free throws, the game
being thrown away on lhat account.
