# Bawlout Bares Braves' Brains And Blockheads
## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
Filled with the triumphs and fol
lies of Stanford's Indians during au
tumn quarter, the Bawlout makes
its winter debut today at the
Cashier's Office in the Administra
tion Building.
From its Lewis L. Aaron to its
Paul Ztilch, the academic whip is
sprinkled with revelations concern
ing Stanford's "3,043."
Close scrutiny shows:
That the parents of the "500" were I
fairly well agreed on what names
they should give their infant daugh
ters two decades ago. Many of them
liked Mary, and the Grand Old
Name appears'in the Bawlout 45
times. Runner-up is Dorothy with
2fl duplicates, and the name Eliza
beth brings 2G to their feet or to
the phone.
That there are more Roberts than

any other of the 200 or so male
given names. Close to the total of
157 Roberts are the lists of 147
Johns, 128 Williams, and 84
Charleses.
That the Smiths have the corner
on the Farm's surnames, with 315 of
them enrolled this quarter. The
names of Williams, Johnson, Miller,
Brown, and Thompson, which tie for
second place with totals of 1(5 each,
push the usually legion Jones down
to third place with only 10 repre
sentatives.
That there are 3.6 students to
every faculty member.
That 2,331 are registered from
California, 634 from other states of
the Union, and 78 from foreign
countries.
That no surname begins with "X,"'
and only 7 with "Q,"
