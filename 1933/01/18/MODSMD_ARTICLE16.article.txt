# LESLEY DEPICTS EUROPEAN LIFE
## Lecturer Describes Dutch, English, Germans 
### 
Presenting a most intimate picture i
of European life. Dr. Everett Parker ;
Lesley last night shared with his I
audience English tea, Dutch cheese, i
and German beer:
England's traditional tea drinking !
interested Lesley. Ho found that in 1
technical laboratories, in business j
offices, even in American consulates, j
4 o'clock tea is the rule. The English j
working day is longer, but the hum- !
drum of business is twice inter- j
rupted.
Dr. Lesley likes the Dutch, but j
dislikes Holland. The country is flat, j
uninteresting. "The picturesque
windmill," he said, "is so speedily I
disappearing that there has been !
formed a Society for the Preserva- j
tion of the Windmill.
"Dutch canals are nice at a dis- J
tance, but at close range some of â– 
them are actually used as sewers."
At the University of Delft, Dr. and
Mi's. Lesley attended the ceremonies
which attended the opening speech |
of a new doctor of mechanical en- j
gineering. The entire speech was in
Dutch, but after the formalities were
over, the speaker's wife asked Les
ley, "How is Stanford." The lady had
received her A.B. on the Farm.
In Germany, women were work- j
ing in the fields, plowing, mowing, i
and pulling carts. "The Germans," i
said Lesley, "are not afraid of work."
