# Ex-Committee May Ban Traditional Big Game Rally Bonfire
## Student Executives Meet Tonight to Consider the Abandonment of Thirty-Year-Old Tradition; Corbus, Karl, Hewlett Favor Plan 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
THERE IS LEFT of just one more Stanford tradition will prob-
I ably tio up in smoke, literally this time, at tonight's meeting of lh«
! Executive Committee.

The Big Game bonfire, traceable back, into tlio late "nineties," after over
thirty years »f annual fame, will have joined the Junior Opera and other
hangovers in the Farm's junk-heap of outlived traditions, if campus
leaders take affirmative action on the matter to be proposed by President
Bill Corbus and Student Manager
Charles Karl.
Corbus Gives Reasons
Branding the once-cherished pyre
as no longer having any real u.ie
here, Corbus pointed out three prin
ciple reasons for his stand on the
question. They are:
1) The vast amount of wood and
other materials gathered yearly for
the bonfire, especially during th<"
present economic depression, might,
well be put to better use.
2) The freshman class, us amply
illustrated last November, have
failed to show the proper and tradi
tional enthusiasm for their class
project. They no longer have a real

interest in its construction.
3) In recent years the affair ha.;
not created enthusiam to any de
gree in the student body itself, for
whom the structure has been built,
for post-rally celebration.
Not Official Vet
Nothing official has taken place
concerning its abolition, student of
ficials declared. Definite action will
rest tonight with the Executive
Committee, who seem to join in fa
voring the plan, however.
Marion Hewlett, a member of the
Committee, applauded the movement
as a move in the right direction.
She added: "It is a good idea, even
though some may oppose the plan.
This year's fro.sh class proved that
the bonfire is out of place and has
no spirit behind it.
Money Wasted
"A great deal of money is wasted
on its construction. Why not use this
sum to some advantage, and if it;
must be spent, why not sponsor an
all-University dance or some simi
lar means of entertainment in place
of the bonfire?"
In the meantime, campus interest
centers around the meeting of tin-
Commitee tonight, when it will also
consider the plan of the Theatre
Committee to sponsor a "musical
production of a light nature" in
place of the former Junior Opera
of the past.
