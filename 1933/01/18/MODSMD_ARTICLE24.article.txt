# Pledges To Pay For Row Meals Only On Saturday
## 
### 
Freshman pledges are again re
minded by Ike Liverinore, President
of the Interfraternity Council, ifiat
(hey should not be charged more
than the price of Saturday meals by
the houses. This rule has the double
effect of saving the pledges money
and encouraging them to continue
to cat at Encina, where their normal
contacts with brother frosh can be
had.
Liverinore also slated that, as is
usual following pledging, all restric
tions on lushing arc now lifted.
