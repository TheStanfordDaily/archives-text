# WHY DO A HALF-WAY JOB?
## 
### 
Tonight I luÂ» Ex Committee will tackle the job of im-
I'l oving the 1' arm s brand of veil leading. Anyone who has
sat in Cardinal rooting sections through the last three foot
hall seasons will vouch that it is a noble undertaking.
The committee is driving directly at the weakest point
in the yell-leading set-up, the method of selecting candi
dates and of electing the chief. II was way hack in Spring
quarter of \'{2 that the Daily first remarked at the stupidity
<>l that set-up.
The worst feature about it is that students are ex
pected to choose, in spring quarter, between two candi
dates thev have not seen in action since the Big Came. An
other fault is the manner of selecting the two assistants.
Students are given a brief glimpse of twelve candidates
at basketball games, the number is cut to six by the Rally
Committee, and the names of the remaining six appear on
'he ballot in spring. Nobody remembers how good this
man, or that one, was; few seem to care. The result is that
politics lakes complete control of the election.
Last quarter tin's column suggested the obvious remedy.
'I hat was to elect the yell king immediately after football
season ended, when memory of the abilities of each aspir
ant was fresh in the mind of every undergraduate. It ad
vocated appointment of the two assistants by the Rally
(.ommi I lee.
At that time all seemed agreed that the Daily was right.
Now, it appears, there are those who think that it would
hardly be worth while to have another election per year
lor the sole purpose of choosing a yell king, and that select
ing him at the regular February poll would be improve
ment enough. Others feel that the right of election of as
sistants ought not to he taken from students.
Cranled, there would be politics in Rally Committee
appointment. Hut there is politics in student ejection. And
the Rally Committee would know what the men could do.
Students cannot, however many times the frvoufees are
shown at basketball games. Student election is pure poli
ties. Rally Committee appointment would be politics plus
Knowledge of respective abilities of the candidates. Which
is the lesser evil?
Cranled, too, that another election would take a bit of
lime and effort. Hut the memory that is hot at the end of
Autumn quarter, though not stone cold as it is in spring,
would be at least lukewarm in February.
Why not hisurr better yell-leading, instead of doing a
halt-way .job?
