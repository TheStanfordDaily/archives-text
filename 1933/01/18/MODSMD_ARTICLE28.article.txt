# GRIPE JUSTIFIABLE
## 
### 
There is probably no single group of persons that takes
the beating handed to those whose business it is to meet
the public. In a large majority of cases, gripes about "poor
service" are simply objections of customers who find it
irksome to await their turn, however frantic the attempts
of the clerk to satisfy everyone at once.
If ever there was an exception to this generality, there is
in the case of the service at the counter in the reserved
book room of the library. It seems to be the favorite pas
lime of the men behind that desk to engage in conversa
tion back among the book stacks while prospective Phi
Betes are left cooling their heels.
Students are seldom in a terrific rush to get the vol
umes they need. But they can't be blamed for finding it
annoying to be left standing unnoticed while the men whom
lliey are paying to hand out the books exchange pleasan
tries of the day at the far end of the counter.
