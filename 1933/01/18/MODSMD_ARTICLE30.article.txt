# BULL SESSION
## UPWARD THE RISING SUN 
### 
It seems fairly clear that the
China-Japan fracas has moved out
of the Comic Opera class and is
really in the Big League now. As
long as Japan landed marines and
China merely landed complaints at
the League Office, it was a good
laugh. Floyd Gibbons added the last
laugh when he broadcasted two ri
val generals during a specially ar
ranged two-hour armistice.
But the stage props are down and
the gay music has ceased. Japan
means business. She is going ahead
iri Manchuria as fast as her taxes
are collected. She seems determined
to kill all the opposition rjorth of the
Wall. And she seems pretty success
ful in her determination. The Sino-
Japanese War is a real war.
But the sun keeps shining every
now and then over here on (lie
campus. Stanford ALMOST beat
U.S.C. in basketball—and pitiful as
it may sound, that's news. It's so
hard to imagine that human beings
are being driven from their homes;
that men are being smithereened.
And 'after all, that isn't a very so
phisticated idea to toy with. It's very
clever to yawn gracefully, and ob
serve that China will win in the
long run. But in the long run, the
Chinamen of 1933 will be disinte
grated corpses.
It doesn't seem possible that with
all this talk about Peace Pacts and
Conferences and the New Day, that
one nation would be allowed to un
dertake a first-rate aggressive war.

Prussian Militarism, which was so
popular in all European countries,
was supposed to have been buried
these 14 years. Japan's march on
China makes the Advance on Bel
gium a gesture of brotherly love.
; m
And the League of Nations . . .
What an acrid laugh it must hand
the Chinese. It becomes the most
colossal piece of organized hypocrisy
yet to spring from the diseased en
trails of diplomacy. It's a great little
gatherer and printer of facts—rival
ing the important Wickersham Com
mission in that regard. And never
forget the Aaland Island Contro
versy; the League settled that. No
League adherent will ever let you
forget that stupendous piece of
work.
But as far as stopping anything
that SOMEBODY wanis to keep
moving, forget the League. And
Japan is a very big Somebody. There
are only two things that will stop
Japan—bankruptcy or Russia. At
present, bankruptcy looms as the
most formidable stopper. Russia be
ing unwilling to risk Her System for
a flyer in Manchurian wheat fields.
The United States seems annoyed
at Japan—at least Stimson has been
buzzing around with notes and
whatnot ever since the boil north of
the Philippines broke—spattering
pus from Shanghai to Mukden. Il
would be a real joke if' America had
to join with Red Russia to re-set the
Rising Sun of Japan.
