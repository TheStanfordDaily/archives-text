! CAVALCADE—By Noel Coward.
William Ilcincmann Ltd., London,
| 19.32.
For a reason not entirely clear,
| English patriotic symbols seem much
I more effective than American ban
| ners, bunting, and oration despite
■ the satiric jabs that have been di-
I rected at each during the past cen
j turies. Perhaps it is because there
' is about the English monarchy and
the thousand meaningless little judi
cial and legislative ceremonies used
lor ages, an appearance, at least, of
dignity and calm. A calm not to be
found among raging Midwest
farmer-senators or fiery representa
tives—or even in the White House
| which, occasionally, houses an arm
| waving heckler.
That is why the last scene of
j "Cavalcade" is far more effective
with its waving Union Jack than a
like scene, similarly approached,
with a floating Stars and Stripes
might be.
To criticize "Cavalcade" as a play
would be futile; it is essentially a
musical show—but one with a tre
mendous and serious sweep. Its
tragic theme—the hopelessly thwart
ed ambitions of a nation—shows
Coward in an entirely different light
than his comedies do. He is here a
disappointed sentimentalist, a cynic
whose lifetime has seen two huge,
depressing, and futile conflicts and
who, while singing the Twentieth
Century Blues, still hopes that some
day England "will find greatness and
dignity and peace again."
It is an unusual variant from the
average musical comedy book just
as "Of Thee I Sing" is, but in a dif
ferent way. The American satire is
mad and rollicking, descends to
funny and sometimes inappropriate
bedroom gags. "Cavalcade" is bitter,
spectacular, and inclined to indulge
in inappropriate scenes of senti
mentality.
It fulfills its purpose—the repre
sentation, on a huge scale, of English
history during the last decades—and
is magnificent when staged. Because
it is, in print, merely a framework, a
considerable amount of imagination
should be employed in reading it. It
should be remembered that "Calva
cade" is a spectacle to be produced
on so tremendous a scale that th r>
actors are dwarfed until their per
sonalities are nothing, but repre
sentative of the people a sa group.
If read with this in mind most of
the redundant scenes will fit their
proper places and the work will be a
unity. Using so large a scale it has
been necessary for Coward—a Clevel
and brilliant if not a weighty play
wright—to employ theatrical tricks
for an immediate and elemental
emotional reaction. These have been
deftly handled, from the neatly

ironic S.S. Titanic scene to the un
necessary and melodramatic death
of Bridges.
"Cavalcade" is an infernally clever
piece of writing; it may even be
profound underneath its tricks of
| "theatre." But it is the sort of thing
which should harcMy be printed be
cause of its form, its size, and, at
the same time, its apparent shallow
ness.
In reading "Antony and Cleopa
| tia," a play of infinitely greater in
tensity and dealing with two tre
mendous personalities, the sweep is
less frequently lost in intelligent
reading than in production; but
"Cavalcade," episodic, ambitious if
not great, with its mixed elements
of hokum and tragedy, loses in the
reading what a company of two
hundred under a clever directorial
hand will give it. —Sandoe
THE CAPTIVE SHREW—By Julian
Huxley. fJasi! Hlackwell. Oxford,
1932.
Here is a scientist turned poet
who, paradoxically enough, is only a
good poet when he writes of non
seientific things. Rus
sia, bird collecting and the cinema,
philosophy and lawn-tennis claim
Julian Huxley, but poetry is his first
love. At 21, Huxley had written the
Newdigate Prize Poem. Now, 24
years later, having acquired fame in
other fields, Huxley, like Thomas
Hardy and Sir Harry Johnston,
makes another official venture into
Ihe metered world, apologizing for
twenty-four years of silence.
The venture is extremely uneven.
Certain of the poems, plentiful with
microcosms, Time, Elements, Egos,
and Freud are poor, but some of the
simpler poems are beautiful, over*
coming astonishingly awkward form
and faulty rhyming.

"The Plundered Nest" (4 lines),
and "In a Silver Locket," are stanzas
of a singularly fragile beauty, the
title poem is a clever declaration of
the author's attitude toward all
things—"Cosmic Death"' is spine
chilling, impressive. ... Its final
lines:
". . . And all about the cosmic sky,
The black that lies beyond our
blue,
Dead stars innumerable lie,
And stars of red and angry hue
Not dead but doomed to die."
—Guerard
