# CAMPUS OPINION

' The Editor Sir:
During the Christmis holidays
i some wit from the Corporation Yard
| spread a fresh supply of young boul
| ders in the parking space south of
| the Library. We hall men used to
j have a path worn down, and are
j wearing another down now. But it's
hard on shoes and tempers, and
never satisfactory. A good third of
the campus population lias to use
that path several times a day. Why
couldn't we have a regular one, free
from stones and puddles? I don't
advocate anything expensive, such
j as cement, but a raised dirt path,
I cut at intervals for cars and topped
i with cinders or fine gravel, shouldn't
! cost so very much.
Let's unite, hall men! We can act
I through our eating clubs and per-
I hups get the Comptroller to break
down and give us a path. What say?
