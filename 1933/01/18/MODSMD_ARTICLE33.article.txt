Our University, among its other
varied glories, can now boast or hav

viewer. This unique critic bases his
criticism not on personal experience
and intellectual background, but on
hearsay! He attempts to review a
production which he boldly admits
he has never seen, giving as his
alibi several poorly drawn and in

A prominent Stanford professor,
now emeritus, once stated in a
course dealing with dramatic origins
that there were only seven possible
dramatic situations. All modern
drama is based on combinations or
variations of this septet. Yet, our
unusual reviewer gives as one of
his reasons for not attending the
production he reviewed (?) the fact
that Miss Chatterton had used a
similar plot situation in a picture
which was released more than four
years ago!
Next, he accuses Miss Chatterton
of "repeating one characterization"
in all of her pictures of which Frisco
Jennie is supposed to be no excep

"The Clash" and "The Rich Are
Always With Us." In both of them
the leading character is a wealthy,
educated sophisticate. In her present
