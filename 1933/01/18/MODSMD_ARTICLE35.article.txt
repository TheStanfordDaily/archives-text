in the Little Theatre, will be open
to the public.
The play is a three-act farce and
will be read by a cast to be an

murderess, she dies the legitimate
victim of capital punishment, with
the world proclaiming her "the
woman without a single redeeming
virtue." This characterization is
hardly a "repetition" of the gay and
lovable heroine of "The Rich Are

historical and local interest. The pic

the true portrait it gives of early
San Francisco. If Mr. Sandoe pre
fers the horror and the melodrama
of a Dr. Fu Manchu it's O.K. by us.

and prejudiced review at least let
us have it done by a critic who will
have the courtesy to see the pro
