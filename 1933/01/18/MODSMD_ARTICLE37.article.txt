IT HAS BEEN suggested
that Jolt 11 W. Bunn, Stanford's
«-(Tit-i(*>it and alialik* basketball
roach, loach Hal Ldelcn in par
titular and the rest of th<* hoys
in general how To foul more
adroitly.
It i; not our duty to criticize the
coaching of Mr. Bunn, who has
miraculously transformed a beefy
giant, a (iny Jack-in-the-box, a
graceless football star, and two lean
cagers into a feaied und fearful hoop
five. But in his anxiety Iri instruct
his willing squad in the gentle art
of tossing baskets through iron and
netting and passing a brown ball
around as though it wc"! 1 the Queen
of Spades in a game of ( asino, Mr,
Bunn has apparently forgotten that
fouls in basket ball should be ielt
but not seen.
IN THREE OF TIIE FOUR
non-trip games preceding last
night's, Ldelcn left the fray at
strategic moments because he
luid committed four personal
fouls llagrant enough to catch
(he attention of the eagle- i!
one-eyed referee. In two of the
four, Topping also went out on
personals, ami Captain Conlry
left the S.F.I', game for the same
reason.
Now it behooves us not to suggest
that Stanford play a le:,s-aggressive
brand of basketball, but si/ice we are
of bourse interested in the welfare
of the Cardinal team and since
Bunn has at the very most, and
probably stretching a point at that,
only live basketball players, the
boys simply must become less ama
teurishly cumbersome in their rough
by-play.
IT IS ALMOST NEEDLESS to
repeat the famous fact that mod
ern intercollegiate warfare is of
such an intense nature as to
make rule-violating necessary to
success. Teams must foul or he
fouled, ami we are heartily
against putting Stanford under
any handicap. An important
fundamental of any major sport
is learning scientifically to dish
it out and learning experimen
tally to take it.
Elbowing a man friendly-like in
the kidney is the way of showing
him that you, too, believe that per
sonal contact constitutes one of the
prime pleasures of intercollegiates;
picking a loving opponent up by the
heels and tossing him a block or so
jus I proves to you both how hard
you fight for your alma mater; hold
ing the star of another team only
goes to show that it. is all in the
amateur spirit of good, clean fun.
FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO
COME TO COLLEGE for an
education and manage to find
time somehow every autumn to
show up on the gridiron for a
little exercise and relaxation
from studying have regretfully
recognized this apparent neces
sity to the game they love so
much. The J call football legal
ized murder, and the fouling is
Ihe murder part; they insist learn
to foul or spend their afternoons
watching opponents scamper
over them with unwittingly
heavy feet and cleated shoes.
Basket ball, being underemphasized
as a collegiate sport, does not de
mand as much fouling and therefore
few coaches spend much time drill
ing their men in this essential of
tlu game. Anyway, il seems to come
natural. But even basketball teams
must learn to foul without being
caught, as a modern athletic unit is
only as strong as its weakest fouler.
