## English Diplomat Believes In Conciliation 
### 
Speaking to a packed Assembly
Hall, Sir Frederick Whyte, English
diplomat, yesterday praised the
Stimson Doctrine of cpntinued con
ciliation in the East and declared
that unless America adheres to this
policy, it is likely that future gener
ations will have to fight for peace.
Stating that the Manehurian ques
tion is "one of the greatest of our
international problems," Sir Freder
ick proceeded to present the back
ground of the present difficulties.
Concerning China, he said that fox
years the Manchu dynasty worked
to keep foreign influences out of the
country. Although China has ef
fected some reorganization since the
Revolution, her progress has r>eces
sarily been so slow that "in a crisis
like the present she is unable to
meet Japan."
The speaker then turned to Japan.
He pointed out that although the
traditional Japanese attitude toward
foreigners had been the same as that
of China, the Elder Statesmen had
succeeded in capturing enough
Western ideas to make Japan over
on the modern plan.
Their slogan: "Relief at home
through expansion abroad" can only
be realized through territorial ex
pansion; and that means trouble as
long as Japan considers Manchuria
"the life line of Japan.''
