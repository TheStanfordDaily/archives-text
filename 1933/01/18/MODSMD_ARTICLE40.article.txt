# Packard Booms Oval Prospect
## 
### 
Cardinal track prospects boomed
a notch yesterday on the appearance
of Dave Packard in a track uniform.
Packard, an all-around athlete,
sauntered off the hardwood basket
ball courts of Encina Pavilion onto
the soft, springy soil of the old oval
and immediately "began tossing out
the discus.
Albeit lanky Dave began proceed
ings with the plate, his forte is the
hurdles and the high jump. As a
freshman, he clid just about every
thing in the Little Big Meet but |

sweep out the stadium after the
shouting was all over. That day
Packard won three first places and
tied for first in a fourth. He was
always able to lead his teammate,
Gus Meier, in both hurdles races,
and at present, Meier is the ace of
the Indians in these events.
However, Packard will have to hit
I the ball if he expects to beat out
Meier. The latter stepped out yes
terday to spiint against time in a
special 120-yard high barrier race
i and he negotiated the distance in the

j excellent time of 15.1. In fact, the
watch actually stopped at about
15.05, but as they still use one-tenth
of a second as the smallest unit of
time measurement on the track, the
first figure is the one for the books.
Another favorable aspect of the
afternoon's workout was a 1:56.5
half-mile dashed off by lean-flanked
Ben Eastman. And all this despite
the chill cold of a windy afternoon.
Ben is not in the best of form yet,
as his choppy stride gave witness,
but we will still stake our money on
1 I the lad.
