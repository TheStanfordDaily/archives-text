# SENATE FREES FILIPINOS OVER HOOVER'S VETO
## Immediate Freedom Group In Islands May Block Final Acceptance 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (/P) —
Freedom for the Philippines was!
granted by Congress today, the
Senate voting to override President
Hoover's veto of the independence
bill.
The issue was cast into another
phase of uncertainty arising from the j
Insular Legislature's attitude toward
the measure. The island lawmakers
must approve the bill before it be
comes effective.
Manila Opposition Seen
Indications from Manila are that j
strong and determined opposition ] ■
may be expected from a faction that |
wants immediate and unrestricted
freedom, as contrasted with the ten
year transitional period provided by \
Ihe bill which passed today. ]
A rush of Senate votes served to j ;
.sweep aside President Hoover's j;
vigorous and repeated objections. <
The bill was repassed by a vote of 1 i
66 to 26—five more than the neces- ! j
sary two-thirds. ! •'
The House voted, 274 to 94, last | <
week to set aside the President's |
veto. | i
Members of the Philippine Inde- | \
pendence Mission here received a j 1
cablegram from a caucus of about j ;
half the members of the island <
House objecting to the measure. ! I
Full Liberty Demanded <
Manila dispatches said many of i <
those who attended did not partici- 1 I
pate in voting to send the message, t
which said:
"Representatives agreed by prac
tically unanimous vote the Hawes- i t
Cutting bill as repassed by Congress j <
will not be accepted by the present \ (
membership of the House, even after ■ 1
t+ie return of the mission. j ;
''The membership of the mission is j j
informed if no other legislation can ]
be secured, the present law should j i
continue until receiving from the'
Democratic administration legisla- |
tion giving immediate independence!
in the sense it should not be post- I
poned except for the time necessary j ,
to effect a transfer of sovereignty." |
