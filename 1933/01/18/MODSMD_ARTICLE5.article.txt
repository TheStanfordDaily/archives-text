# Install Howler To Wake Sleeping Frosh At Encina
## 
### 
No more will tardy watches and
clocks keep freshmen from their
paid-in-advance Encina meals, as an
electric "howler" is now being in
stalled to herald the advent of the
meal-hour.
A button in the office of Mrs.
Hilda Longyear Watson, head of the
Encina Commons, whose initiative
has put the scheme into operation,
will operate the centrally placed
sounding device. Five minutes be
fore the Commons' portals open, and
two minutes before ihe fearsome
doors close, the warning sound will
be given.
Whether Encina's much-needed
slumber will be interrupted by the
call for breakfast, or whether fresh
men will be allowed unbroken sleep
until their eight-o'clocks, is a mat
ter the frosh will decide themselves
after the "howler" starts operation
in about a week.
