# RUGBY REVIVAL DISCUSSED AT SPECIAL MEET
## Enthusiasts Give Further Impetus To Campaign For Old Sport 
### 
Further impetus was given to the
return of Rugby football to Stanford
at a meeting held last night in the
Union. About fifty former Rugby
stars and enthusiasts were present,
including Jim Wylie, former mem
ber of the famous New Zealand All-
Blacks, "Scotchy" Campbell, captain
of the 1923 American Olympic cham
pion team, Norman Cleaveland, a
member of that team, and Harry
Maloney, who has been instrumental
in attempts to bring back the game
which was played here between 1906
and 1917.
Practice Today
Those present decided to turn out
this afternoon at 4 o'clock on the
freshman football field for the first
practice. No equipment will be
available and all those interested are
asked to come dressed as for soccer
or as nearly as possible. The prac
tice will be informal in character,
according to Cleaveland, with the
stress laid on giving everyone pres
ent a chance to play.
The meeting was enthusiastic in
its demand for the return of the
game as an outdoor sport for the
winter quarter and for those gradu
ates who find the need for some
exercise other than golf. The prac
tice sessions, which will be held
every afternoon at 4 o'clock, will be
open to anyone with a knowledge of
the game or a desire to play, either
undergraduates or graduates.
League Organized
Hopes for the return to popularity
of the game are seen in the fact that
similar movements are going on all
over the state. A short time ago a
large group of Rugby supporters met
at Ewing Field in San Francisco and
formed the Northern California
Rugby Union with Harry Maloney
as secretary.
The Olympic Club, the University
of California, the Shell Oil Com
pany, and an outfit, the
Wanderers, are all forming teams,
and it is hoped that teams may be
brought up from the South for play
in the near future, according to
Cleaveland.
