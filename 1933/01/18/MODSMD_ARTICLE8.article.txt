bate question, "Resolved, That West- '
em Civilization Must Travel the j
Moscow Road" will be given in the j
Little Theatre at 8:15 o'clock to
morrow night. British Columbians j
Neil Perry and Victor Dryer will
face Stanford's lanky Frank Ful
lenwider and black-headed Joe j

The Canadians, lauding Commun- |
ism, are fresh from an intra-Empire I
debate with an English team. Al- J
though this verbal fracas, on the j
same question as ihe forthcoming
one, ended in a victory for the !
Britishers, the decision was won only '
by the smallest margin.
Dryer and Perry have been given j
headlines in Northwestern papers
for their excellent forensic skill, j
Fullenwider last year was a mem- j
ber of the team that went barn- |
storming through Southern Califor- |
nia. He is a member of Delta Sigma
Rho, honorary speaking fraternity. 1
Fessio is a good prospect for this
year's M-G-M movie debate.
The visitors from the North will J
be honored guests at a pre-debate
dinner Thursday night. The dinner, j
sponsored by the International Com- j
mittee of the A.S.S.U. and the De- I
bato Council, is in charge of Comp- !
