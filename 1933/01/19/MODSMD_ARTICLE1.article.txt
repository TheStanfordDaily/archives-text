acceptance of the Theatre Commit

Nut one dissenting vote blocked
the proposal as May 2(5 was made a

to produce, in collaboration with the
Dramatic Council a piece of "a light
musical nature" in place of what
was the Junior Opera.
Musical Comedy
According to preliminary opinions
as expressed by members of the
Committee at its meeting on Mon
day, it is probable that a popular
musical comedy or one of the works
of Gilbert and Sullivan or Victor
Herbert will be offered. "Girl Crazy"
and "Good News" were mentioned
as the more modern suggestions.
A special meeting of the Theatre
Fund Committee has been called for
Monday afternoon, according to
Chairman Stan Beaubaire, for the
purpose of selecting several prospec
tive shows for later consideration.
Beaubaire stated that, although wo
men's rushing would handicap any
meeting of the group this week,
plans would be continued by its
members in the interim. Each indi
vidual has been commissioned to in
vestigate one or more popular suc
cesses that might feasibly be pro
duced on the campus, he added.
Final Action

the Ex Committee, Stanford's musi
cally inclined dramatic stars are
promised all the opportunity they
desire to revel in the fun and fes
tivities offered by a show of this
type.

ment to be drawn up in the form
of a contract between the Dramatic
Council, of which Harold Helvenston
