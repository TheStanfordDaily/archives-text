Unit the bonfire lias been abolished. When I hey had il, they
didn't give a healthy hang about it. Freshmen had to be
browbeaten into constructing il. Students watehed it burn
with Ihe easual interest they would show toward any large
conflagration. Few ever broke an important dale to be on
hand to see the product of a tremendous amount of work
and a considerable amount of money go up in smoke. j
Yd today, when this tradition backed bv a lot of senti
mental rot is taken from them, they'll start blubbering, sun
as fate.

Those who prefer lo apply common sense lo last night's
j action of the Executive Committee will accept it without
question, realizing that the annual pyre, though fun to
build, perhaps, and pleasant to watch burning, is no longer
worth the tremendous cost. That cost is in labor, in the
physical and mental upset of the freshman class for a
week, in a huge pile of wood that might be used to heat
shivering families, and in a sizeable outlay of actual cash.
Jn the old days of rip roaring, blood and thunder col
lege life, the bonfire was undoubtedly worth this annual
1011. Then students got a big kick out of ii. They built it
with feverish jov, with a frenzy which their football "spirit"
gave them. They rallied around it in a great burst of en
thusiasm on the night it burned. To have abolished the'
bonlirc then would have been a crime, since the old-timers
actually got out of it in pleasure what they had put into it
in labor, money, and wood.
But it was carried by a spirit that no longer exists, and
as that spirit waned, the bonlirc grew in size until today it
is a burden too heavy for the remaining feeble flicker of
the Farm's mob psychology (spirit) to carry.
Last night the Executive Committee showed common
sense, and courage.
