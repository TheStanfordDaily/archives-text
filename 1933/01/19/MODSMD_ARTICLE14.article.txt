Bending, swaying, gesticulating al
most wildly, stomping and throwing
himself completely into the emotion

the utmost in feeling and tone
quality.

Outstanding selection of the con
ceit was Tsehaikowsky's Sixth
Symphony, the "Pathetique," in
which the difficult rhythm and har
mony were majestically rendered,
spoiled only slightly in the last mo

the flatness and lack of timing of
some of the horns.
