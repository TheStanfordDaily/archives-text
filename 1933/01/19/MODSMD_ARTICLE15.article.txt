# University Almost Called 'Leland De Witt Stanford'

### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Not Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity, but Leland DeWitt Stan
ford University: such would have
been the official title of the Univer
sity if it hadn't been for an incident
which happened one evening in the
fall of 1882.
The Stanford family was assem
bled in the library of their home in
San Francisco. Governor Stanford
was signing some legal papers in
which it was a matter of importance
that his son's name should be ac
sprately mentioned. The lawyer
read the documents aloud, and when
he came to the words "Leland De-
Witt Stanford," the 14-year-old boy,
up to this time deep in a book,
looked up and said: "No, that is not
my name —my name is Led and

J Stanford, Junior."
He was informed of the import
ance of the change he was making,
and the necessity that it should be
final. He was thoughtful for a mo
ment, and then said: "Papa, I want
to have your name exactly."
When the University was founded
some years later it was named after
Sen ator Stanford's son; thus the
boy's unexpected change of name
subsequently resulted in a difTerent
title for this institution.
The rather cumbersome official
name of thr University has caused
some difficulties for the authorities.
Letters have been received from
people saying that they have heard
of junior high-schools and junior
colleges, but never of a junior uni
versity.
