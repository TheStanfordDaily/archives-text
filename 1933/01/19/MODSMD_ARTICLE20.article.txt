# Beer, Bonfire Join Ranks Of Old Traditions
## Student Sophistication Rules Pyre Junking

"One keg of beer for the four
of lIS
Glory be to God that there are
no more of us
For one of us could drink it up
alonci"
No more will freshman voices ring
out lustily from the "outposts"
guarding the Stanford Bonfire in
all-night vigils.
Last night the Bonfire joined the
ranks ol junked college traditions.
Today it is as defunct as the Plug
Ugly, Encina water raids, frosh haz
ing, Stanford's own "Toonervillc
Trolley," and the Junior Opera.
Build It High
For 32 years the freshmen have
answered the taunt, "Build it to the
sky, Frosh," as the Big Game rolled
around. Since 1900 the Bonfire has
featured the pre-game celebrations.
All Palo Alto flocked up to see the
burning. It was called the '"Biggest
College Bonfire."
But sophistication frowned on
"hot-cha eollegiatism." The Junior
Plug-Ugly was the first 10 feel the
axe. At its demise the Daily Palo
Alto bemoaned, "the thrill of the
night fights—the long vigils—is gone:
there is no romance in the glare
of the day."
Recently the mortality of tradi
tions has reached a new peak. In
192!) freshman hazing was banned.
A few months later the famous cam
pus trolley was torn up. Encina
water raids received the administra
tive frown in 1930.
This year the campus accepted the
abandonment of the Junior Opera
and the proposal of the Stanford
Axe as a trophy.
Berkeley Threats
'I he Bonfire lias had a colorful
history. In 1912 rumors were current
that Berkeley intended to burn the
pyre.' But, as usual, nothing came
of it.
Only in 1928 was the completed
Bonfire actually burned. And then
the chairman of the Rally Commit
tee declared, in response to rumors,
"Anyone who s;iys that the mem
bers ol the Rally Committee burned
(he Bonfire is an unmitigated liar."
But Jast night the Bonfire was
dinged. And Berkeley raids are a
thing of the past. No more will cam
pus correspondents write of "barbed
wire entanglements" and "co-eds
fleeing into the night as the invaders
advanced brandishing clubs, bottles,
and blackjacks."
