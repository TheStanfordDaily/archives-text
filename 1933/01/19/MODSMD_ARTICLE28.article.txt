# THE 						RUGBY REVIVAL
## 
### 
Present agitation on the campus and in San Francisco
for a revival of the game of rugby brings back dim memo
ries ol the old gridiron sport a sport of short pants, fast
action, and bruised shins a sport of greater enjoyment
for the contestants than the present game of football, to
hear some of the old rugbv stars tell it.
There" s 110 doubt about it, rugby is a thrilling game. It
used to afford great pleasure to collegiate athletes and to
thousands of spectators alike. Hut rugby has been dead, in
the United States, for well over a decade. In that decade
tastes have changed. To the average sports fan of today the
acme of enjoyment is watching a football play of power
and deception, as executed by the boys from Southern
(California, for example.
Still, rugby is a fine sport. It continues to draw crowds
ol greater than 100,0(H) in London, where the American
football game has made no progress. Rugby is still an ex
cellent sport from the players" standpoint. And, like any
sport which satisfies athletic youth's love for play, it is a
game worth playing.
If a seemingly sufficient number of Stanford men want
to play rugbv, then the game should he played on this
campus. It is unlikely, however, that the Board of Athletic
Control will consider it wise to sponsor rugbv as a part of
the Stanford athletic program of varsity rank. Although
if is not inconceivable that rugby may some day come back
throughout the country, displacing football as the great
collegiate game, that condition has by no means arrived at
a state 1 of reality now. The R.A.C. cannot, if seems likely,
support a sport of that status at this time. Hut if Stanford
men want to play rugby, then thev should be allowed to
play it, on an intra-campus basis, if not in varsity competi
tion.
