# A 						THIEF MAKES A JOB!
## 
### 
From lime to lime articles of clothing have been stolen
from the coat hangers in the Library. Last week a brand
new winter overcoat was missing. With our persons and
purses suffering from the present condition of the weather,
liiis final depredation arouses everyone to anger.
II is natural to assume that this theft was committed by
some outsider. The fact that the coat racks are off to one
side in the Library makes it very simple for the thief to
get away with the stolen article. NO one would be likely
to notice him, and if they did think he wasn't a member of
the I niversity they would undoubtedly class him as one
of the visitors who frequent the library.
I here seem to be two modes of action. In the first place,
if might be possible to move the coat hangers into the re
serve book room, where the clothing would at least be in
a more conspicuous place. As another alternative, it might
be possible to put a student in charge of the coats and hats.
I his attendant would only have to be employed from seven
o'clock in the evening till closing time, as it is during this
period that the largest quantity of clothing would have to
be checked.
II the authorities are worried about the financial end,
the offer of a book of meal-tickets from the Union cafeteria
for a certain period of work would probably seem verv
attractive to a good many students.
How about it Mr. Van Fallen, can Ibis be arranged?
