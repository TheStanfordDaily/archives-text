If Ruth Judd's "Y" chromosome
had been an ' X" or maybe it's vice
versa, and as a result she had been
christened Robert Judd, there is little
doubt that today she would be en
tered upon another step in the fa
mous nitrogen cycle. If the Arizona
killer had been a man, she would
have long since passed from the
front pages of the California prints
to a cold grave in the Arizona sands.
Perhaps, Arizona sands are warm.
We don't know.
But because the newshawks can
describe Ruth Judd as "pretty and
blonde" (although the cameras dis
prove the first and cast doubts on
the second), she managed, by one
legal hook or another, to hang on
to the front pages month after
month. She is a convicted murder
ess. By the law, she is to be killed.
Why all this heart-play and delay?
Normally, she would have already
given up her life. However, her law
yers were able to sell her EXCLU
SIVE life-story to some newspapers;
and with the proceeds from that
scoop, the battle has been waged.
There seem to bo no extenuating
circumstances. Sex alone is delaying
the execution. If money were being
used to withhold the rope, a horrible
hue and cry would rend the air and
the demagogic larnyx. Is it any less
corrupt that the criminal's sex is
the deterrant?
Of course, sob the sob-sisters
among both sexes, it is terrible to
think of hanging a woman. They
weep miserably at the picture of a

frail wisp of feminine gentleness and
mercy dangling from a hemp rope.
It Is not particularly pleasant. But
neither is it relishable to conceive of
that sweet, mild, kind creature com
mitting such a horrible thing as
murder.
If it is especially touching for a
woman to slip to eternity through a
trap door, it is also especially hor
rible to think of a woman killing
another woman. What perversity fat
sod"!' normally gentle souls to over
come their gentleness and kill! That
is the only logical outcome of the
argument that drapes all women in
fleecy clouds and sweet illusions.
The have been prattling
about equality for years and years
all the time enjoying the superior
1 position. In fact, I am about con
vinced that all this equality-talk of
theirs was merely a gigantic smoke
screen to hide their upper niche.
And men thought they wanted qual
ity when they already had a
; .itrangle-hold on everything that was
worth holding (outside of them
selves) —namely, men. A feint with
| the left—it is called in boxing.
And the Arizona law decrees that
swinging by the neck is the death
penalty. Men have swung every now
and then for lo these many years.
It is Ruth Judd's turn. The hair
pulling, eye-streaming, and result
, ant nose-blowing is becoming a bit
disgusting.
Let the Law act. Arizona justice
has been too sex-conscious. It's an
noying. —Abe Mellinkoff

Of course, sob the sob-sisters
among both sexes, it is terrible to
think of hanging a woman. They
weep miserably at the picture of a

frail wisp of feminine gentleness and

It Is not particularly pleasant. But
neither is it relishable to conceive of
that sweet, mild, kind creature com
mitting such a horrible thing as
murder.
If it is especially touching for a
woman to slip to eternity through a
trap door, it is also especially hor

argument that drapes all women in
fleecy clouds and sweet illusions.

If Ruth Judd's "Y" chromosome
had been an ' X" or maybe it's vice
versa, and as a result she had been
christened Robert Judd, there is little
doubt that today she would be en
tered upon another step in the fa
mous nitrogen cycle. If the Arizona
killer had been a man, she would
have long since passed from the
front pages of the California prints
to a cold grave in the Arizona sands.
Perhaps, Arizona sands are warm.
We don't know.
But because the newshawks can
describe Ruth Judd as "pretty and
blonde" (although the cameras dis
prove the first and cast doubts on
the second), she managed, by one
legal hook or another, to hang on
to the front pages month after
month. She is a convicted murder
ess. By the law, she is to be killed.
Why all this heart-play and delay?
Normally, she would have already
given up her life. However, her law
yers were able to sell her EXCLU
SIVE life-story to some newspapers;
and with the proceeds from that
scoop, the battle has been waged.
There seem to bo no extenuating
circumstances. Sex alone is delaying
the execution. If money were being
used to withhold the rope, a horrible
hue and cry would rend the air and
the demagogic larnyx. Is it any less
corrupt that the criminal's sex is
the deterrant?
