SOUS LES TOITS DK PARIS —
(Toits) —At the Varsity Theatre.
This is a' sentimental melodrama
without a plot. While somewhat
superior to Rene Clair's other pic
ture, "A Nous La Liberte," this sup
posed masterpiece makes one won
der just what the French standard
of excellence is.
The story is hardly worth relat
ing. There are not attempts either
at character or motivation, and all
the principals seek to impress and
wring tears from the audience by
looking continually downward, eyes
watering. The plot moves with pain
ful slowness—too slow for good
melodrama, and unenlightened by
anything except the murkiest senti
mentality. The musical score con
sists of two fairly good numbers,
much overworked.
Rene Clair's famed direction tricks
were for the most part painfully ob
vious, and for that reason failed
completely. He showed no gleam of
humor, no dramatic sense; his idea
of unity seemed to be to repeat each
scene and to interrupt the action
frequently by a view of les toits. The
technique was that of the silent film,
dialogue being reduced far below
minimum. The recording was bad,
and the photography; though it in
cluded some excellent realism, fre
quently went astray. —Zimansky
A PLAIN MAN'S WlFE—(Kerr)—
At the Curran Theatre.
"A Plain Man's Wife" is a domes
tic comedy drama which would un

doubtedly be successful in the re
pertoire of a small town stock com
pany, partly because of the univer
sal appeal of the "turning worm"
angle, partly because of the play's
hearty and sometimes blatant hu
mor. A tyrannical father, rabid on
Ihe subject of "plain living," drives
his family to the breaking point,
whereupon the family revolts and
the father becomes meek. The com
edy is of the most obvious sort; one
laughs with pleasure at guessing the
answers correctly. Excellent tempo
sustains the play beautifully; but
when attempts are made at serious
ness, deficiency in writing and di
recting are painfully obvious—no
tably in the second-act climax, when
the ingenue drags her fiance to the
footlights and exclaims, ''This has
got to stop. I can't stand it any
longer."
Louise Dresser, looking sweet and
charming, tried to get more out of
her role than there was in it; very
funny, though not at all subtle, in
her comedy scenes, she fell flat when
she became serious, largely because
she overacted. Her lusty efforts at
voice projection made her voice un
necessarily raucous. Charles Clark
was good as the father, a one-sided
character exaggerated almost to the
point of caricature. The rest of the
characters were well cast and are to
be commended on the effect they
gave of actually belonging to the
same family. Even the small boy did
not incur my usual displeasure at
child actors. —Baruns
