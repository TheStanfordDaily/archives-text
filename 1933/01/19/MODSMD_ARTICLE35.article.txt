# CAMPUS OPINION
## IN REPLY

The Editor, Sir:
In answer to the accusations of
Mr. Henry Brill I should like to
remark:
1. That while I do not contest the
fact that there are few situations
from which drama can be made, I
do object to certain manners of
handling a situation. I supposed that
everyone knew, with mention of!
Madame X—of which this picture
is undeniably a stencil—how ridicu
lously coincidental, grossly senti
mental, and exaggeratedly melodra
matic a situation could be made, that
mention, of the likeness would be
sufficient citicism.
2. That Miss Chatterton docs not
materially vary her performance,
however differently she may be cos
tumed. Her mannerisms, her intona
tions, her acting of comedy and pa
thos, while they may be more exag- j
gerated in one film than in another,
are approached and handled in the
same manner consistently.
3. That if the heroine of "The j
Crash" is wealthy, educated, and 1
sophisticated, the heroine of "Frisco !
Jennie" in her capacity as madame
of a bordello is affluent and hardly
naive; and that if Mr. Brill considers
education to consist of instruction
in the art of luring scci'ets from
business men while compromising
one's self badly, he had better re- i
consider the Announcement of
Courses in any academy of learning, i
4. That if a few shots of Market j J
Street trolley cars, some views of!
falling timbers, and a long picture
of the interior of a Barbary Coast
bawdy house is of "great historical
interest," then De Mi lie's bathtub j
biblicals are likewise tremendously |
important historical documents. Per
haps Mr. Brill considers the visit of j
Prostitute Jennie to the Big Game j
of 192(> to be of considerable local 1
interest. I do not believe that a cam- (
pus poll on this problem is necessary, j
5. That, beyond the fact that the
star knows only one role—that of j
Miss Ruth Chatterton—which can j
be proved well to the unperceiving j
only by a concurrent showing of any ;
two of her vehicles, this is the third j
time that Miss Chatterton has played j
the identical role in what is, with
the most trivial differences, the same
film; others: "Madame X," "Once a|
Lady."
6. That I do not base criticism on j
hearsay since from a knowledge of
the plot gained from the Warner
studio itself and the trailer for the
film, seen at the theatre two days
before, revealed its deficiencies
clearly.
7. That I did not approve "The
Mask of Fu Manchu" and preferred
to see it only because it was a less
obvious quantity.
8. That if Mr. Brill doubts my rea
sons for avoiding the film he may
consult the reviews of periodicals
of such varied interests as Variety,
Time, and even the' San Francisco
Chronicle and the San Francisco
Call-Bulletin which I referred to in
a flash of self-consciousness after
reading his letter. They all seem to
discern like faults.
9. That if he doubts the truth of
my observations after this harangue
he may retire to Gehenna and sit
upon a stone.

1. That while I do not contest the
fact that there are few situations
from which drama can be made, I
do object to certain manners of
handling a situation. I supposed that
everyone knew, with mention of!
Madame X—of which this picture
is undeniably a stencil—how ridicu
lously coincidental, grossly senti
mental, and exaggeratedly melodra
matic a situation could be made, that
mention, of the likeness would be
sufficient citicism.
2. That Miss Chatterton docs not
materially vary her performance,
however differently she may be cos
tumed. Her mannerisms, her intona
tions, her acting of comedy and pa
thos, while they may be more exag- j
gerated in one film than in another,
are approached and handled in the
same manner consistently.
3. That if the heroine of "The j
Crash" is wealthy, educated, and 1
sophisticated, the heroine of "Frisco !
Jennie" in her capacity as madame
of a bordello is affluent and hardly
naive; and that if Mr. Brill considers
education to consist of instruction
in the art of luring scci'ets from
business men while compromising
one's self badly, he had better re- i
consider the Announcement of
Courses in any academy of learning, i
4. That if a few shots of Market j J
Street trolley cars, some views of!
falling timbers, and a long picture
of the interior of a Barbary Coast
bawdy house is of "great historical
interest," then De Mi lie's bathtub j
biblicals are likewise tremendously |
important historical documents. Per
haps Mr. Brill considers the visit of j
Prostitute Jennie to the Big Game j
of 192(> to be of considerable local 1
interest. I do not believe that a cam- (
pus poll on this problem is necessary, j
5. That, beyond the fact that the
star knows only one role—that of j
Miss Ruth Chatterton—which can j
be proved well to the unperceiving j
only by a concurrent showing of any ;
two of her vehicles, this is the third j
time that Miss Chatterton has played j
the identical role in what is, with
the most trivial differences, the same
film; others: "Madame X," "Once a|
Lady."
6. That I do not base criticism on j
hearsay since from a knowledge of
the plot gained from the Warner
studio itself and the trailer for the
film, seen at the theatre two days
before, revealed its deficiencies
clearly.
7. That I did not approve "The
Mask of Fu Manchu" and preferred
to see it only because it was a less
obvious quantity.
8. That if Mr. Brill doubts my rea
sons for avoiding the film he may
consult the reviews of periodicals
of such varied interests as Variety,
Time, and even the' San Francisco
Chronicle and the San Francisco
Call-Bulletin which I referred to in
a flash of self-consciousness after
reading his letter. They all seem to
discern like faults.
9. That if he doubts the truth of

he may retire to Gehenna and sit
