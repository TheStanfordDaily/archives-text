Jill] GREEN BAY PACKERS, one of the outstanding teams in
professional football, and opponents for Ernie Nevers' All-Stars
in the Knights of Columbus game at Kezar Stadium Sunday, ar
rived in town Tuesday-and started to work immediately at Ewing
Field. The Packers played two games in Honolulu over the
( hristmas holidays and won both of them by comfortable margins.
But they have probably been on their own pretty much since then,
and now that it's raining they are going to have plenty of trouble
getting in enough workouts.
Their coach, Curly Lambeau, took one look at Ernie's squad and
hustled his men into their practice togs. He has seen plenty of Nevers'
coaching and playing, and he repects both of them—plenty.
If you have any doubt that Ernie will have a team, run your eye over
a few of the names: Brovelli, Pinckert, Musick, "Bullet" Baker, Bunny
Belden, Tom Mallory, Nevers himself, McKallip, Ebding, Turk Edwards,
George Christianson, George Hurley, Steponovich, Mel Hein, and Frank f
McNally.

|T WAS CERTAINLY great to see John Bunn surrounded by his
whole squad, or most of it. last night. The varsity hoop mentor
lias been having an awful time since his return. It seems that the
'oiks in dear old Kansas wanted "something to remember him by,"
so they borrowed a couple of Stanford basketball outfits.
Imagine the pride with which you could point to a full suit of Cardinal
clothes, and say "a present from our boy who made good in the West."
Bunn is reported to be considering a trip into the great Northwest for
next year's aggregation.

'JP 11 IS BASKETBALL TEAM of ours seems to have some things
in lair quantity, but it lacks others entirely. For instance, it lacks
endurance or ambition. It's darned hard to tell which, but when
tilings get scrambled and some of the boys stop to look the situation
over, there is obviously something wrong. Basketball is one game
where you have to do your thinking on the run.
Up to last night's game there was practically no substitute material
at all. Now it looks as if Carrel Weaver is going to crack the front ranks
if he continues to improve. Why there aren't others is still a mystery.
But at least let us hope. p> q ■yy j r
