# LACK OF CENTERS FACES U.C. FRESHMEN SATURDAY
## 
### 
Undefeated after three contests
1 against 1 op-notch opposition, Cali
fornia's freshman basketball team is
preparing for the first game of the
Indian-Bear Little Big Series next
Saturday night, minus the services
e of its first- and second-string cen
t ters.
s Harry Cordes, the best California
a tip-off man, played his high-school
ball at Palo Alto High, and had a
big part in last year's Paly victory
y over the Stanford freshmen. GeVie
Stevenson, first substitute, has been
e pressing Cordes hard for the start
ing post.

Cubs Score Threat
Notwithstanding this loss of cen
ter material, California's scoring
" machine is little damaged. Art
Nightingale, forward, is the best
Bear shooter—he connected for
thirty-six points against Lowell High
and Bakersfield Junior College.
The California record to date:
51 Marines 45
27 Lowell High 16
! 45 Bakersfield J.C. 25
On the farm, Rabbit Bradshaw is
taking advantage of the two practice
days left before'the Indian yearlings
must take the floor and play before
' an intimidating crowd of five or ten
' thousand rabid Bear supporters.
Cards Doubtful
Tuesday's decisive defeat at the
r hands of Galileo High School, may
, either completely discourage the
> Papooses, or else fire them up to
; better basketball than they have
: played so far. They will probably
• not play average basketball. Good or
I bad? There's no way of telling un-
I til the opening whistle.
Realizing how hopeless the situa

| tion was, Bradshaw used nearly
every member of his squad against
Galileo. Of the men who have not
yet done much playing, Jake Katz
showed exceptional speed, the rest
being slow and passed poorly.
Linotip Same
The starting lineup against Cali
fornia is likely to be the same that
started Tuesday: Greenlee, center;
Mannion and Rosenberg, forwards;
Barnett and Farber, guards.
Missing set-ups and free throws
are characteristics of the Indians'
preliminary season performances to
date. If they can eradicate these
weaknesses they should have a much
better chance of winning than the
midget 1932 yearling five.
