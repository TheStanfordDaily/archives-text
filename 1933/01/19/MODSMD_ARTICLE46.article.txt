# UNIVERSITY BOUTS CALL MITTMEN TO HEAVY WORKOUTS
## Phil Johnston Outstanding In Unlimited Class As Workouts Start 
### 
Visioning the miniature gold box
ing glove symbolic of an all-Uni
versity crown, Stanford's great col
lection of boxers are going through
rigorous workouts under the direc
tion of Myron Schall and Harry
Maloney in preparation for the
championships February 2.
The latest innovation to keep the
fighters in trim is a chart on which
each man records the number of
miles of roadwork done each week.
In addition to the usual drill on
various punches, Schall has had the
scrappers sparring one or two
I rounds at each workout.
Phil Johnston, novice heavyweigh
champion, at present appears Vto be
the standout in the unlimited\dass.
In a workout with Ira BaerA fast
junior middleweight, JohrntonJ
showed worlds of speed.
Johnston tips the beam at 131
pounds and it is doubtful if he \m
meet any larger men. It is uncertl i
whether Ben Palamountain will
out, but another good-looking pros
pect in the person of Alf Brandin,
frosh football star, was working out
recently.
Brandin is also doubtful whether
he will enter the all-University
championships, but he looks very
fast and packs a heavy wallop.
