## Molinari And Wife Like Stanford Audience 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
With the last majestic strains of
(lie "Tarihauser" Overture, Ber
nardino Molinari stepped off the
Stanford stage to be greeted by a
reporter who had small French and
less Italian. But, with the aid of
intermittent French, English, and
gestures, Maestro Molinari managed
to convey an enthusiastic approval
of the reception accorded him by
the Stanford audience, the first col
lege audience before which he had
appeared. He liked their enthusiasm
and their spirit.
The eminent conductor paid trib
ute to the "lovely Hollywood Bowl,"
and to the San Francisco Opera
House, which he says has excellent
acoustics.
Madame Molinari contributed a
bit more English than her husband,
and also expressed her delight with
Stanford. She accompanies her hus
band on all his tours, this being
their fifth year in America. From
their San Francisco engagement they
go directly to Rome, where Signer
Molinari will conduct the concerts
commemorating the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the Augusteo.
