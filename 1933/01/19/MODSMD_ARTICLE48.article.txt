# Brazil Backs Argentine Treaty To Prevent War
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 18 (TP) â€”
The first adherent to Argentina's
proposed South American anti-war
treaty was obtained today when
Brazil notified Saavedra Lamas,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, that it
"would be proud to sign." Brazil
also suggested that all nations be
permitted to sign instead of those
of South America or Pan-America
only.
Nine boys at Oklahoma Agricul
tural College were fined $3 each for
"filling the air with odd noises" after
police had issued warning for no
night serenading.
