# FIFTH POSITION PUZZLE IN CARD BASKET LINEUP
## Stanford Defense Strong When Squad Follows Bunn's Coaching 
### Dick Strouse 
Still uncertain about the Weaver-
Edelen battle for the fifth position of
Stanford's basketball team, Coach
John Bunn took his first-string
squad up to Berkeley last night to
watch California's Golden Bear in
j action against the California Aggies.
Bunn is well satisfied with the
work of C'Uitain Cordry and Top
ping at th ffftrwards and with Jay
Tod arrj/John Hancock at guard.
When th<?se four (and whoever is
wo'xinf with them) remember to
gjt baÂ»/c in position, they present a
I defensi that was good enough to
hold U.S.C. to one set-up in two
gamfs. And Cordry, Topping, and
| Hancock can all shoot.
Edclen Fine Passer
But the fifth position is a puzzle.
When Edelen plays, Stanford has a
smooth-passing, great defensive five
that still possesses only three men
who are dangerous offensively. And
when Weaver is in the game, the
team boasts another fine shot but
somewhat less defensive power.
1 And on defense! Topping .shifts up
to forward and Hancock shifts up
i to center. That makes a guard out
of Weaver, a position that he has
played most of this year. Cordry and
Tod remain stationery.
Topping Jumps Center
To add to the complications, Top
ping jumps center when Edelen is
in the game. Recently, Hal has been
handicapped by a boil on his hand.
' but it is not serious enough to in
terfere with his playing against
! California Saturday night.
The Olympic Club game Tuesday
proved the potency of Bunn's state
j ment that whet\ Stanford plays as
she is told, she is good. In spite of
an early Card lead, the Clubmen
won because two and sometimes
three of them would face Jay Tod
when he alone hurried back into
position after an offensive thrust.
Cordry Drops 'Em
As a matter of statistical interest,
Cordry sank four out of eight field
goal attempts in the first half and
three of them were made on a line
with the basket. Weaver dropped in
three out of four, and two ,were
well out, while Topping sank two
of his three attempts. Shooting like
that will beat Cal, but some nights
they drop and on others they don't.
And it will take the smooth passing
that Stanford has exhibited spas
modically this year along with the
; thoughtful defense that really
stopped the Trojans (manpower won
that series) to shackle the cocky
Bear's claws.
When Weaver plays, the lineup is
a complicated crossword puzzle. On
offense, Topping plays center, Han
cock is a guard, and Weaver is
Cordry's forward running-mate.
