# INDIAN QUINTET TO TANGLE WITH U.C. TOMORROW
## Stanford Rated As Dark Horse" Of League; May Upset Bear Team FEATURE IS DEFENSES Weaver's Showing Tuesday Earns Position 
### Bob Letts 
Stumped as the 'dark horse" of
the Pacific Coast Conference south
ern division by reason of three sen
sationally close battles and a victory j
in the last, week, Coach John Bunn's
Stanford basketball team invades the
new University of California gym
nasium tomorrow night bent on up
setting thei Bears in the first contest
of the annual three-game series.
Originally looked upon as the con
ference doormat, the Cards have j
been switched around to such an j
extent that Bunn now has five men j
and a couple of capable reserves j
who might turn the Bear's growls j
into mere whimpers.

Stanford has a defense of its '
own, und because both schools are I
.so well equipped with scoring pre- j
ventatives it looks like a battle with j
the final score in the neighborhood j
of 30 to 25 for California.
The starting five that Bunn pro- j
duced here Tuesday evening had j
much in the way of merit. Carrel j
Weaver's brilliant showing as Tom ;
Cordry's running mate at forward j
gave the Indian attack the needed j
kick and evidently earned Weaver a j
starting post tomorrow. Weaver!
played a guard position on defense, j
and was seen picking the casaba off :
the backboard regularly. His passing |
was good, but he needed a trifle i
more speed to make him an ideal J
mate for the cat-like Cardinal cap- j
tain.
Eiferl Is Hot
Over at California, Nibs Price will
use "Bonexs" Coughlan and Hal .
Eifert at forward, Captain Jack ;
Reade at center, and Murray Wem
ple and Jack Crowley at guards. Eif- !
ert has run wild this year and al- I
ready has totalled 110 points. Read j
has been a thorn in Stanford's side i
for three years.
Wcmple, a transfer from Marys- ;
ville Junior College, is big and fast
and can hit the hoop regularly. Ted
Ohashi, the flashy Japanese guard,
has been doing some great work in l
practices this week, according to re- j
ports from across the bay, and will
undoubtedly see action. Ohashi, in ;
addition to being a clean player, is j
one of the flashy type that makes j
games interesting.
