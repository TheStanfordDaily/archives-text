# 'DONA CLARINES' SHOWN TONIGHT
## Spanish Club To Stage Play In Little Theatre 
### 
Popular comedy by the Quintero
brothers, "Dona Clarines," will be
offered by the Spanish Club in the
Little Theatre at 8 o'clock tonight.
An accomplished cast is said to make
the meaning of the play clear even
if the onlooker does not understand
Spanish.
Playing the title role will be Fran
ces Slanina, who handles the emo
tional part like a professional. She
has had considerable experience in
language parts.
Phyllis Wilson, carrying the in
genue lead, Marcella, makes her de
but on the Stanford stage. In her
emotional scenes the delicacy of her
restrained feeling is in fine contrast
to that of the older woman. Miguel
Gomez, as Miguel, although not as
at home on the stage as Miss Wil
son does a bit of real acting in his
scene with her in the last act.
Carlos Odriozola, the comic uncle,
lends a clownish touch. Angelina
Alustiza, Mary Louise La Venture,
Arthur Azevedo, and Theodore Mc-
Allister ably support the principals.
The play is directed by John T.
Reid, instructor in the Romanic
Languages Department. It will be
open to the public.
