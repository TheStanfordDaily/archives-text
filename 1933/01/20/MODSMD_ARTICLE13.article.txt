# Oxford Groups Are Not Emotional Nudists--Dean
## 
### 
Buchmannism or the Oxford
Group Movement, sometimes called
emotional nudism, is not just sensa
tional nonsense as alleged by its
critics, the Very Reverend Cecil S.
Quainton of Victoria, 8.C., explained
last evening to an inquisitor from
the Daily.
"Based on personal experience, it
is an attempt of the churches to
keep up to the minute psycholo
gically. It is a scientifically sound
way of routing the hidden inhibi
tions of which modern youth is so
conscious." Quainton, oratorically
gifted dean of Anglican Cathedral,
continued with a description of the
theory in practice:
The plan is for a mixed group of
college students and clergymen to
join in a week-end party. In the
course of the holiday, the various
guests as they feel moved to do so
rise in meetings of the group and
confess their own shortcoming.*. It
is a group application of the time
honored custom of relief through
confession.
"The movement is an attempt to
recover the reality and freedom of
the Christianity of the first century,"

| said the Dean, relapsing from genial I
informality into his eloquent clerical I
manner. "Sinners are sent to re
pentent fellow sinners for spiritual |
counsel rather than to professional
confessors. When a person has felt
the release of unburdening his trou
bles, he is enthusiastic about help- f
ing his friends to do so. This is S
termed 'sin-sharing.' House parties t
are a jolly form for repentance, r
what? '■
"Simplicity is the keynote of £
Buchmannism. Its tenets are the T
maintenance of the claims of hon
esty, purity, unselfishness, and love." c
In answer to a question on the )
nature of the house parties the &
Canadian said: F
"Ours are similar to ordinary
house parties. I say, they are not ]
match-making affairs, though. Few,
if any, marriages have resulted."
Quainton is a qualified proponent
of the cult, having participated in it r
at Oxford and Cambridge last sum- i
mer. He attended a ten-day house | T
party at which he became an ardent I
advocate of Buchmann's ideals. The i
Dean made the statement that this r
experience helped to form his re
ligion into a living thing. I

Buchmannism or the Oxford
Group Movement, sometimes called
emotional nudism, is not just sensa
tional nonsense as alleged by its
critics, the Very Reverend Cecil S.
Quainton of Victoria, 8.C., explained
last evening to an inquisitor from
the Daily.
"Based on personal experience, it
is an attempt of the churches to
keep up to the minute psycholo
gically. It is a scientifically sound
way of routing the hidden inhibi
tions of which modern youth is so
conscious." Quainton, oratorically
gifted dean of Anglican Cathedral,
continued with a description of the
theory in practice:
The plan is for a mixed group of
college students and clergymen to
join in a week-end party. In the
course of the holiday, the various
guests as they feel moved to do so
rise in meetings of the group and
confess their own shortcoming.*. It
is a group application of the time
honored custom of relief through
confession.
"The movement is an attempt to
recover the reality and freedom of
the Christianity of the first century,"

| said the Dean, relapsing from genial I
informality into his eloquent clerical I
manner. "Sinners are sent to re
pentent fellow sinners for spiritual |
counsel rather than to professional
confessors. When a person has felt
the release of unburdening his trou
bles, he is enthusiastic about help- f
ing his friends to do so. This is S
termed 'sin-sharing.' House parties t
are a jolly form for repentance, r
what? '■
"Simplicity is the keynote of £
Buchmannism. Its tenets are the T
maintenance of the claims of hon
esty, purity, unselfishness, and love." c
In answer to a question on the )
nature of the house parties the &
Canadian said: F
"Ours are similar to ordinary
house parties. I say, they are not ]
match-making affairs, though. Few,
if any, marriages have resulted."
