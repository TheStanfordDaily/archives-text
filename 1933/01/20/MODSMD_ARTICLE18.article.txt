in regard to the selection of the

as steps have been taken to rectify
the question of producing a spring
j musical show, I should like to have

j pendent upon three things: avail-
I ability of rights, the economic ne
j cessity of selecting something which
j is possible for a specific budget, and,
I probably the greatest item of all,
j doing something for which we have
I available talent—voices, to be exact."

also because, to the member, it has
offered personal ideas which are
constructive."
