# FAGAN ATTACKS "BUY AMERICAN"
## 
### 
That "Buy American," the new j
policy of William Randolph Hearst, j
was fundamentally unsound, was I
the statement of Professor Elmer D.
Fagan, of the Economics department, ;
yesterday.
Fagan stated that if the policy
should gain a foothold here the re
sult would be to retard the progress
of the entire world and would only |
benefit those parties in the United 1
States who are not dependent upon
foreign products for their livelihood. |
Because of the complex nature of I
society today Fagan stated further, I
no country can successfully keep to 1
itself and at the same time be pros- !
perous. Should the United States |
succeed in boycotting foreign goods i
it would as a result be unable to J
export those products which are |
necessary and are the very soul of
certain industries. This would be so
because of the barriers that would
immediately be raised against the
United States.
It would be foolish to argue fur
ther on this point, Fagan concluded,
as any book on Economics proves !
the fallacy of such a narrow view.
