# Indian-Bear Gridders May Clash In Ring For Student Relief
## Boxing Matches, Basketball Game to Feature Athletic Charity Carnival Proposed by Bill Corbus; Dance Scheduled to Aid Fund 
### 
AFTER conferring with Stanford University authorities concerning plans
.for launching of a student relief drive, Bill Corbus, A.S.S.U. head, yes
terday revealed three proposals for aid which have been discussed by the
Student Relief Committee.

The proposals as outlined are as follows: (1) An all-University dance,
the proceeds of which will go toward the student relief fund; (2) an
athletic charity contest featuring a basketball game between the Stanford
varsity and an opponent to be chosen later and boxing matches between
members of the Stanford and California football squads; (:J) organization

fot Ihe campus into various groups
| with the appointment of chairmen
| to be responsible for collection of
| funds within the different groups.
Corbus announced that two cam
pus orchestras had volunteered their
services to student relief. "These
orchestras would cut the overhead
on relief dances to a minimum," he
said. Corbus was enthusiastic over
the possibilities for raising money
by the athletic contest. He thinks
matches between Big Game grid ri
vals would attract many fans.
"The third proposal, that of divid
ing the campus into groups, is the
customary method used in drives of
this kind. Its greatest merit is that,
contributions could be unlimited, and
those able to afford a large donation
would have an opportunity to give
more," Corbus said.
Corbus announced that after ten
tative plans have been considered
more fully a general assembly will
be held to acquaint Stanford stu
dents with the specific details of the
campaign. It is expected that within
a week or thereabout the plans will
be matured.
