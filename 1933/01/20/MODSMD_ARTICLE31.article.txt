# A 						CASE FOR PROMPT ACTION

### 
II will probably be startling lo a majority of students
to Irani how little support the I'niversity offers to one of
the Farm's most colorful sports, a sport in wbicb Stanford
lias developed a team that can hold its own with almost
any in the country. That sport is polo.
While other minor sports, perhtips Jess deserving, go
happily on with equipment, train trips, and medical service
supplied by the I'niversity, polo struggles along almost on
ils own with a meager donation from the Ji.A.C. of JfrJOO
dollars per year, scarcely sufficient to keep it in polo bulls.
Yd Stanford's horsemen, competing under the name of the
I niversitv, relied immeasurable credit upon it with sterl
ing plav against high-ranking teams from Arizona to Ore
gon.
I'olo-playing students pay a *%'{() per year fee, listed as
a syllabus charge, in an attempt to meet the expenses of
keeping up their field, of taking occasional trips, and of
incidental items. In addition to this, they are obliged to
purchase all their own equipmentâ€”helmets, sticks, boots,
etc.
As though this were not enough to prove that Stanford's
riders are the most maligned sports group on the Farm,
add this lo the list of justified grievances:
Polo players have no access lo the physical therapy
plaiil in the yyinnasimn, and horsemen hurt while repre
sent iiuj Stanford on the field arc obliged to pay their own
doctor bills.
The men who play this dangerous game are not kicking
about having to buy all their own equipment, pay train
lares, etc., though they might be thoroughly justified in do
ing so. They ask merely that when injured they be given
the same consideration offered to athletes representing
Stanford in other sports.
Their request is so obviously justified that delay in
granting it would he a blot upon Stanford's record of fair
play.
