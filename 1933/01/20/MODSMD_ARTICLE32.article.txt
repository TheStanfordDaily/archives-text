# ANY CHANGE FOR THE BETTER
## 
### 
Tuesday night's Ex Committee session made some vej'v
worthwhile modifications in the system under which Stan
lord yell leaders are selected. The trvouts of sophomore
yell leaders at non-Conference football games, the selec
tion of six by the Bally Committee for further tryouts in
the Basketball Pavilion, the election of two assistants from
these six at the February elections, and the simultaneous
election of the next yell leader all these new by-law pro
visions represent improvements.
t'nder the terms of these changes, the quality of yell
leading on the Farm will almost inevitably improve. As
the Fx Committee realized, no better trvout could be held
for sophomores than a non-Conference football game. Any
aspirant who is able to wring a yell from the crowd at the
San .lose game, for example, will deserve to be mentioned
on the Bally Committee's "select six." The election of chief
and assistants in February certainly gives voters a better
opportunity to recall yell leading abilities than does the
present system of election in the spring.
However, as this column has frequently pointed out, the
Fx Committee slopped a little short of adopting the best
possible plan. Were the two assistants to be appointed by
the Bally Committee, which manages the tryouts, and were
the yell leader to be elected in the month of December, just
at the conclusion of the gridiron season, then Stanford
could be still more certain of improving upon the poor
brand of yell leading which has predominated recently.
