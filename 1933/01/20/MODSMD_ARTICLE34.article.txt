It, used to be the poets who told
of love. Now, the accountants are
the boys who really know what it's
all about. As romance flew out the
window, the silver dollar rolled in
the door. A modern divorce trial is
not a pathetic story of broken love
or the like; but is much more like a
practical lesson in high corporate
finance.
The big problems in marriage and
her sister, divorce, are financial.
Every step in the love cycle is over
loaded with money bags. The in
evitable Man from Mars would never
know that love was a thing of the
heart. It seems to be lower in the
human anatomy—precisely, at the
hip-pocket where, among other
things, is carried a check-book.
Libby Holman was in the court
room fighting for money before her
widow's black needed its first dry
cleaning. The latest gag is that she
and her incubator son don't want
the money for themselves but simply
to donate it to worthwhile social
causes.
That's a splendid motive. It's plain
to see that our Libby is just a great
big philanthropist — misunderstood
by the whole big world. For a social
welfare worker, Libby is not only
unusually attractive but too aggres
sive to convince most people. Maybe
the sad death of her young million
aire husband was the event that sent
her on the holy path of philanthropy.
More about love and romance is
found in the current story of a man

who will spend the rest of his life
in jail to satisfy an alimony-seeking
wife. The man can't pay—which is
not an unusual phenomena today.
Bingo, clap him in jail. His earning
capacity does not increase while ly
ing flat on his back on a jail cot.
The longer he stays in jail, the
more alimony he must pay. The
more alimony he must pay, the
longer he stays in jail. The longer
time he stays in jail, the longer time
he will have to ponder and dream
over the mystery of life and the
beauties of love in America.
Also, current with these stories in
the papers, is the touching idyl of
some woman whose heart is broken.
The salve necessary to soothe her
wounded love is $200,000 from the
heart-breaker. Assume the worst.
Assume the worst. Assume the Old
Boy did promise to marry her and
later found put she had incurable
halitosis—read the Saturday Evening
Post from cover-to-cover—and drank
tier coffee from the saucer.
Can't he change his mind? Or is
he bound to the promise like a
business agreement to ship so many
mustard plasters from Oshkosh to
Kalamazoo? Love is blind and must
a man pay for his blindness if by
some direct manifestation of divine
light, he sees all before the final
tie-up? It puts a premium on blind
ness.
Love is very intricate and one of
its most baffling intricacies is its
system of bookkeeping.
