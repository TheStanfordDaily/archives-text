DELIGHTFULLY INANE
The Editor, Sir:
Every now and then one of the
original young reporters treats us to
a delightfully inane feature article
about something or other.
The most recent idea was to go to
the "big shots" on the campus (by
the grace of Almighty God), with
the question: "What two books
would you take if you were to spend
the rest of your life on a desert
island?"
The first thing that occurred to
me, and I have spent some lovely
hours on a couple of desert islands
in the Caribbean, was that books
are almost useless there because of
the hight humidity. So why not wrap
them in celophane?
One of the gentlemen answered
that he would substitute the Shake
speare volume of another for a cook
book. Admirable! But imagine using
"eggs, flour, etc.," on a desert island.
The "most beautiful co-ed" replied
artificially: "I'd take along a couple
of ham sandwiches" and I can't re
member what else. Here tKe young
lady, in effect, cries: "Hear ye! Hear
ye! Fellow eds and sister co-eds—
I am superbly sophisticated."
It is hard to see how anyone could
think of taking ham sandwiches to
a desert island. After a stroll around
the island, dear Miss, your stomach
would be so full that the very sight
of ham sandwiches would make you
sick.
So why not abandon these awfully
complex questions and ask some
thing easy? After all the 500 must
have their beauty (?') sleep.
