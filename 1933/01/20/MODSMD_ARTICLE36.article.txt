# OUT OF THE PAST

The Editor,' Sir:
Permit mo to join you in applaud
ing the A.S.S.U. Executive Commit
tee for two of the most sensible
moves made on this campus in years.
The Big Game bonfire had patheti
cally and pointedly outlived its pur
pose, if we grant that it ever had
one. The Junior Opera had been a
decidedly risky investment for the
entertainment dollar for at least the
past ten years.
Any of the three suggested sub
stitutes for the late Junior Opera
would be an improvement. But it
seems to me that these three plainly

fall into the following order of de- j
sirability: Recent musical comedy—
a poor third. Victor Herbert—a slow i
second. Gilbert and Sullivan—out- |
standingly first choice. And why?
Practically , all of the successful '
musical comedies of late have been 1
carried to success by the personality j
of a star with years of I
experience. For example, !
with Eddie Cantor was a riot; i
"Whoopee" minus Eddie amounted 1
to practically zero. As for plot, mu
sic, and dialogue, the less successful
musical comedies have been at least ;
as bad as the average Junior Opera. J
Victor Herbert wrote many good j
tunes, but the books for his operas i
were written by a very lame lot of 1
librettists. The tunes live, but the \
operettas are already practically for- j
gotten.
But the Gilbert-Sullivan products ■
are admittedly head-and-shoulders
above any other light musical plays i
in the English language for their '
balance of catchy tunes, clever lines, j
coherent plots, and colorful roles, i
Their merit is attested by the num- j
ber and success of recent profession- |
al performances. —J. M. Willits, '25 j
