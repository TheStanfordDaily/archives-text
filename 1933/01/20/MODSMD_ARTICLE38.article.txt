TRISTAN AND ISOLDE—By John
Erskint'. Bobbs-Merrill. 1932.
John Erskine, professor of English
at Columbia University prominent
authority on education, and beloved
iconoclast, desecrates another fa
mous couple.
Although not as well known as
Adam and Eve, nor as sensational
as Helen of Troy, Tristan and Isolde
prove to be delicious personages
when endowed with the glowing
flesh and blood which Erskine be
stows upon the historical characters
that he chooses to debunk. They are.
in fact, more keenly delineated, more
humorously yet humanly character
ized' than their fellows in history,
or rather, in Erskine.
"Isolde was Ihe king's betrothed,
b,ut Tristant went to fetch her for
the wedding, and on the home jour
ney they fell in love, and tho best
they could do about it was to die."
But in the meantime, Isolde married
the king in order to be near Tristan.
Her lover with difficulty reconciles
himself to the idea: "She has a
maiden soul, to be sure, but is at
home in this world." The arrange
ment was unsatisfactory and ended
: in Pyramus-Thisbe tragedy.
But, as "Adam and Eve" was
really about Lilith, so ."Tristan and
Isolde" is about Palamede, Isolde's
Arab suitor. The poets who immor
talized the lovers left him out. Ers
kine believes, because he would have
1 spoiled the story. Palamede was a
Saracen while Tristan was a mem
-1 ber of the Church "in good stand
' ing." If the bards had told the truth
they would have been obliged to say
that the pagan was always a gentle
man while Tristan frequently was
not. If they had given Palamede a
mean touch he would have been no
different from other knights of
Christendom. And so he was obliter
ated.
The up-to-date version of the
love story includes a psychological
study of this refined Arab of high

culture in the land of the exceed
ingly uncouth knights of Arthuriar
legend. —Paine
