# Cardinal Babes Have Small Hope For Bear Tilt Win
## FROSH HOOPSTERS UNDERDOGS IN U.C. MATCH TOMORROW Injuries To Cripple Cal At Center; Viguie Starts For Indian Team 
### 
With a much better chance of
winning than last year, but still in
the underdog position, Stanford's
thrice-defeated freshman basketball
team takes the floor tomorrow night
in tin.' first game of the Little Big
basketball series against California's
unbeaten yearlings. The game will
be played in the new California
gymnasium.
Stanford's lack of tall center ma
larial v/ill be offset by the ankle
injuries of the two best California
centers, Harry Cordes and Gene
Stevenson. Though pie-game Bear
injuries of past, years have usually
been exaggerated, Berkeley state
ments to the effect that these men
will not play at all may be taken
lo indicate that the two California
centers will at least be slightly
weakened by their "injuries."

Will Stanford's defense be able to
stop Art Nightingale, California's
high-scoring forward? The Bear
sharpshooter went wild against
Lowell High and Bakcrsfield Junior
College, averaging 18 ponts in each
of the two games. Ralph Mannion
is Ihe Indian scoring ace, but he has
not yet matched the spectacular
work of the California forward.
Last year's Bear Frosh team was
styled a "wonder team," after win
ning an impressive string of pre
liminary games, but only the height
of Dave Meek enabled the Cubs to
nose out Stanford's often-beaten
freshmen.
Barnett and Rarbcr
Smooth playing Addie Barnett and
Dave Farber, guards, have out
classed the California guards in
practice games . . . their work under
the basket and working the ball
down the floor compares favorably
with the performances of varsity
guards John Hancock and Jay Tod.
Stanford's practice season, though
completed, is still something of a
mystery. At times Jimmy Brad
shaw's players showed flashes of
greatness, passing smoothly, shoot
ing accurately. Everyone clicked
against the Sacramento Junior Col
lege . . . the result was an Indian
victory and the biggest upset of the
collegiate season. Against Balboa
High, lo a lesser degree against Gali
leo, (he yearlings played like prep
school freshmen.
Good Night?
Because of this inconsistency, it
is impossible to predict the winner
of tomorrow night's game. If the
Papooses have one of their good
nights, they will take care of them
selves. If not . . . well, there's still
the varsity game to watch.
The probable line-up for tomor
row night's game:
Stanford— California—
Greenlee C Gait
Mannion F Schoen
Viguie F Nigthingale
Barnett G Olson
Farber G Tenney
