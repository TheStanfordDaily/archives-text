The publicity departments of Cor
nell and California have recently
issued the disconcerting and disap
pointing statements that no Big Red
crew will row next year and no
Blue and Gold eight will travel East
to the annual regatta.

The news is tragic to those in
terested in the sport of rowing
giants, and is explained by the de
pression. But no crew news has
come forth from Stanford. The rea
son is obvious: Stanford has no crew.
Once things were not like (hat.
Once Stanford boasted an ambi
tious group that formed its own
crew and practiced daily in San
Francisco Bay. Twice a Stanford
crew went East to Poughkeepsie.
There is a fascinating story
connected with the second trip,
a trip that marked Stanford's
last rowing excursion to the East
and that resulted in an Indian
second place behind Cornell's
famed eight. Rumor hath said
that the Stanford crew sold its
shell to obtain railway fare
home, and although rumor is as
usual wrong, here is the tale:
Coached by Dan Murphy and
trained by Harry Maloney, crew
thrived at Stanford during the first
fifteen years of this century. In 1908,
Jim Reynolds of Pop Warner-to-
Temple fame, was crew captain, and
within Maloney's memory, no Stan
ford crew ever lost to California.
The boys used to practice in the
Bay near Redwood City, and on days
when the tide was out, they received
most of their workout carrying the
shell on their shoulders out to the
distant waters. It was a long, hard

walk, but zealous Harry brought up
the rear and there were no laggards.
In 1912, dormitories, fraterni
ties, and Palo Alto merchants
raised enough money to send ten
oarsmen and Coxswain Husky
Gucrena East. Stanford finished
sixth, hut three years later the
Cardinal startled the citizens of
a civilized country by losing out
to only Cornell. Stanford finished
that race with a half-mile spurt
that carried it within one-half
length of Pop Courtney's famous
eight.
Crew was run on a pre-foot
ball receipt financial basis in
those days that was much like
the present soccer budget, and
when Gucrena, then coach, and
his men had seen the sights of
New York and prepared to re
turn to the Wild West, they
found that they could ship the
. team but not the shell hack
home.
Reluctantly, Stanford left behind
the treasure that then ranked sec
ond only to the Stanford Axe which
was then more than a Stanford
Axiom. Returning to glory and a
proud and then not-so-famous cam
pus, the crew was delighted some
time later when a loyal group of
Stanford alumni collected the money
to return the shell to its Farm home.
The crew never returned to the
East and the .shell remained on the
Bay estuary, but Stanford's race is
still remembered along the banks of
the Poughkeepsie. —D.S.
