# BALL CLUB SEEKS DRY INFIELD FOR KENEALY CONTEST
## Mort Nutting Shifted To Oufield, Bordy Mallatratt At First 
### 
Having sent the rainy season off
to a fine start as per usual, by
scheduling the opening baseball
game of the winter quarter. Coach
Harry Wolter's varsity is waiting
impatiently for Pop Pluvius to let up
long enough for it to take 011 the
Kenealy Seals.
The visitors are tentatively sched
uled to try again tomorrow, but un
less the clouds leave and the winds
blow there is little chance that Farm
fans- will get a chance to see Herr
Harry's latest creation until next
Wednesday.
Two Games a Week
"From now on we will have a
game every Saturday and Wednes
day," the veteran mentor declared
yesterday "providing that we can
find a dry field at (he right time."
The lineup will be practically the
same as the one previously an
nounced, except for the shift which
will put Gordy Mallatratt on first
base, and Mort Nutting in the out
field.
New Material
Chances for regaining the cham
pionship which Stanford dropped
last year are more or less up in the
air until Wolter has a chance to see
what he can do with the new ma
terial which has appeared since last
year's outfit finished in a tie for
fifth place in the conference with
nine games won and nine lost.
Two or three of the men Wolter
had hoped would be able to play are
at present battling with the faculty,
with the odds about even that two
of them may come out all right. If
they do, and Wolter can find some
hitters among the fifty-odd members
of the squad, Stanford stands to
wage a strong battle with the de
fending Southern California nine.
Americans eat the heartiest break
fasts of any nation on the earth.
Canadians come second.
