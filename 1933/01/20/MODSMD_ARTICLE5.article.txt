# Debaters Clash On Soviet Fate For Civilization
## Canadians Predict Fall Of Capitalistic Regime 
### 
As British Columbian and Stan
ford debaters clashed last night over
the question, "Resolved, That West
ern Civilization Must Follow the
Moscow Road," things looked rather
blue for capitalism.
Red-haired Perry and quick-wit
ted Dryer of the affirmative were
positive in their predictions of a
collapse. Fessio and Fullenwider of
the Farm did not deny that a col
lepse was probable.
The real clash occurred over what
will happen when capitalism breaks
down. Fessio, not at all optimistic,
stated barbarism or fascism were
possibilities. Dryer rebutted that
both barbarism and fascism led to
destruction, leaving the field open
to the trip down Moscow Road.
Outstanding for his wit was Can
ada's Dryer. Announcing that "this
is the best depression we've had,'
he sarcastically flayed national lead
ers who early in 1929 said things
were "fundamentally sound," who
later said things "were not bad,"
finally "promised us beer," and
who will eventually "promise us
good beer."
Questions iti the open forum after
the debate kept the capacity Little
Theatre audience till long after the
chimes had tolled out ten o'clock.
