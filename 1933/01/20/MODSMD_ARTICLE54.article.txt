# STANFORD TRAINER WEIGHS NEVERS' ELEVEN, "WHOOF"
## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
He's seen 'em come and he's seen
'em go, this rugged man that rubs
and pounds the aches and ills out of
the muscles of Stanford athletes, and
who is known affectionately to all of
them as Wallace Denny. Yes, he's
seen 'em come and go, and never
has there been such an outfit as
Ernie Nevers has been working with
daily in preparation for the Knights
of Columbus game Sunday with the
Green Bay Packers.
"They're all real MEN," says
Denny. Whoof! That man Keisling.
I saw him weigh in, 2(55 pounds
stripped. And Edwards, 240 pounds.
And they re all good fellows, too.
What's more, they like the going
rough. I don't know, they say these

Packers have a great team, but I bet
Ernie and his gang give them lots of
trouble."
Despite the fact that his old friend
'•Pop" Warner is going East to Tem
ple next year, Denny hopes to stay
on at Stanford, rubbing muscles, as
long as he is wanted.
"Il I were a young fellow," Denny
says sadly, "by golly, I'd walk back
to Temple just to work with Mr.
Warner. But 1 ve been here ten years
now and I'm getting too old to
change. And the boys here, they're
all good boys. But," and the veteran
trainer shook his head, "I wish we
had a couple here next fall like that
Keisling and Edwards. Two hundred
and sixty-five pounds, whoof!"
