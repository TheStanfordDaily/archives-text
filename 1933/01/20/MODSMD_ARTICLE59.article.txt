# Big Game Bonfire Death Arouses Little Sorrow
## 
### 
The Big Game Rally bonfire died
a quiet death. Anticipated messages
of indignation and sorrow from dis
appointed grads were not received
by student body officials. Stanford
students accepted the verdict of the
Ex Committee with philosophical in
difference as student petitions for
retainment of the fire were not cir
culated.
Student opinion generally favors
the move. The logic of the Ex Com
mittee's move in abandoning the Big
Game pyre was forceful enough to
stifle any opposition.
The Big Game rally bonfire is as
old as the Big Game itself. Ancient
copies of the Stanford Daily, origi
nally the l3aily Palo Alto, reveal
that for nearly twenty-five years,
until 1919, the pyre was built at the
site of the present library. At the
erection of the library in '19. the site
was moved to the field north of the
powerhouse where it was erected
each year until its abolition.
Records reveal that the largest
bonfire in its history was raised in
1926 when a height of nearly 90 feet
was attained. Four times in its his
tory the Big Game pyre was burned
prematurely. 1901, 1914, 1925, and
1928 were the years when the fire
met an ignoble death by hostile foe.

In 1928 a time bomb set the giant
pile of wood and tinder up in smoke.
The entire Stanford student body
mobilized and erected another bon
fie 60 feet tall in less than a day and
a half. * '
In 1920 and 1922 attempts were
made to raze the pyre by dropping
fire bombs from airplanes.
