# Foil Varsity Shapes Up For Season Start
## 
### 
Despite the loss of Fx - ed Pearman,
one of the three best fencers on the
Stanford squad ,this year's foil men
are rapidly reaching top form and
expect to be as strong as when they
won the Heron trophy last Novem
ber. Pearman failed to retufn to
school this quarter but Leonard
Pockman, captain and former Junior
Pacific Coast saber champion, and
his mates will still be the team to
be feared when the fust of a series
of tournaments starts tentatively on
January 27.
