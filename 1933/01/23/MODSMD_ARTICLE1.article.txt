# BERKELEY FIVE BEATS SUB-PAR CARD HOOPMEN
## Eifert Leads Bear Attack In 37 To 22 Rout Of Bunn's Men STANFORD OFF FORM Indians Again Fail To Hold Halftime Lead 
### Bob Letts 
II was a question of going from [
an off-night to an awfully bud night j
when Stanford's varsity basketball j
team dropped the first game of the !
California series Saturday night at !
Berkeley, 37 to 22, after holding a I
14 to 13 lead at the half.
Obviously sour after the first 15 i
minutes of the contest, the Cards j
lost out when they came back after J
the intermission with too much am- ;
bition and not enough concentration.
Passes that failed to hit their mark, j
floor work that did not look nearly
as good as in other games this sea- i
son, only average foul-shooting and j
general mental fumbling got Stan- j
ford so tied up that Coach Nibs !
Price's quintet scored almost at will
in the waning minutes of play.
Eifert Shines
Of the ten regulars that played for
both teams, there was only one man [
who played consistently good ball— |
H;il Eifert, California's beautifully j
polished forward,, who stole the show i
with 17 points to his credit and 1
added some luster to what would j
have otherwise been a decidedly j
drab affair.
Eifert played consistent ball all j
the way. His shooting was, of course, j
good. His floor play was smooth and I
fast. His defensive tactics kept Stan- ;
ford's hot shots in check. He was j
"it" Saturday night.
Weaver Starts Well
The Cards started off well, with |
Carrel Weaver doing some spec- j
tacular shooting in the first 12 min- ;
utes. Captain Tom Cordry got his j
only field goal during that spell, and \
the two men staked Stanford to an ;
11-4 lead with eight minutes left in J
the first half.

Eifert and Captain Jack Read
swung into action for the Blue and
Gold, took the lead in the next five
minutes, and then dropped behind
at the intermission when Jay Tod
and Weaver contributed three of the
Cardinal points made on fouls. After
that it was too bad.
California's airtight defense--—one
that kept Stanford to one field goal,
that by Charlie Glasgow, in the en
tire second half—was the big fly in
the Indian ointment. Altogether, the
locals scored but five field goals, as
compared with 1G for the Berkeley
boys.
Not doped to win, Stanford was
never in the fray with any feeling
of assurance, although Coach John
Bunn's men put up a great effort
all the way. It was just the unfor
tunate circumstance of getting too
keyed up. Stanford still stands a
fairly good chance of copping at
least one game of the series.
