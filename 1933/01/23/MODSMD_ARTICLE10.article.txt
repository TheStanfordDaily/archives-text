# Quainton Finds 'Perfect Freedom With Christ'
## 
### 
"What is it to be a Christian?" j
asked the Very Reverend C. S.
Quainton, dean of the Cathedral at ;
Victoria, 8.C., at the outset of his
sermon yesterday in the Memorial
Church. He stressed the simplicity
of the Christian religion, but stated
that the obstacles are moral rather
than intellectual. He said that with
honesty, purity, unselfishness, and
love, one is ready to approach
Christ, to make Him one's master.
His closing statement was, "His ser
vice is perfect freedom."
Mrs. Warren D. Allen was soloist '
for the service. At the close of
morning worship there was holy
communion.
