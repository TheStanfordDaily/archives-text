# 'Macon' Safety Assured By Sunnyvale Air Base
## 
### JOHN KLINE 
Sunnyvale naval air station will
be to the Macon what Marc Island
is to the naval craft that float in
more substantial fluids. For ihe five
million dollars that Congress appro
i priated to construct the base will
! serve a great many more purposes
than just providing a habitation for
the giant dirigible.
i Preparations of all sorts are being
I made to insure the safety of the
Macon. Inside the tremendous han-
J gar built to house it is a large
I mezzanine floor, 30 feet wide, which
i will contain shops for carpentry,
! gear rigging, and other maintenance
work. Hc?re also are special air
conditioned rooms for preserving
extra gas envelopes. The ship will
be kept firm in the hangar by spring
balances, which will check the
amount of lifting power at the same
i time.
Safe landings will be assured in
{ three ways. Accurate weather re-
I ports from a complete observatory

will be furnished to the dirigible as
it maneuvers above the field. Nearly
four times the number of men which
is considered normally sufficient will
be used to insure against any mis
hap in landing. The flexibility of the
new type mooring mast and 35-tori
tail mooring beam, as well as the
dual mooring circles, makes possible
landing in any direction of wind.
This beam is itself a clever piece
of mechanism. Regardless of the
wind's angle, the nose of the ship
can be guided to the mast in the
center of the mooring circle. Then
the beam propels itself around the
railroad track until it is in position
to make the tail fast. Next the rear
end is towed until it is over the
track leading directly to the hangar.
At this point, a powerful jack will
put a new set of wheels on the beam
into operation, which are designed
to fit the hangar track. Thus the
ship is placed inside much more
readily than by old methods.
