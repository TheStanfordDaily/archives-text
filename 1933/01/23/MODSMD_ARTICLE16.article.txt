# MUSICAL SHOW PLANS WILL BE WEEDED TODAY
## Theatre Fund Committee To Accept Proposals Until 3 o'Clock 
### 
Student suggestions for the spring
musical show will be considered this
afternoon at a meeting of the Thea
tre Fund Committee in the Old
Union.
Ideas will be accepted until 3
o'clock at the A.S.S.U. office for
consideration at this afternoon's
meeting. Today's selections will not
be final; only the poorer ones will
be weeded out. There are strong
possibilities that the final choice will
be made through a Daily poil of the
campus.
Dramatics Director Harold Hel
venston is well pleased with the stu
dent backing which the new theatre
movement Ls receiving. In his words,
"The most significant part of the
whole affair is the fact that students
are beginning to express themselves
as a factor in procuring for Stan
ford University a theatre which will
in the main offer distinct advantages
over the present plant."
Some of the advantages which
Helvenston enumerated are: an
auditorium in which every person
purchasing a seat will be able to see
and hear distinctly everything that
is happening on the stage whether
it is a speaker, concert, or play; and,
a stage which, by virtue of adequate
facilities and equipment, would al
low the production of all types .of
theatrical entertainment.
