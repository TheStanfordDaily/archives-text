An error in the Announcement of
Courses caused the omission from
that volume of one of the most
utiique courses to be offered under
the Department of Education. The
course, entitled "Girl Scout Leader
ship," is to be given next quarter
under the direction of Miss Vaal
Stark, who is the regional director
of Girl Scout work in this locality.
The course will give a unit of
credit and meet from 1:30 to 3
o'clock every Tuesday. It will use
the Girl Scout program as a basis
and offers excellent training and ex
perience for all women who are
going to teach or work with girls in
any line of endeavor.
