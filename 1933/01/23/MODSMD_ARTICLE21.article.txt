# China Masses Army To Halt Japan Thrust
## 250,000 Troops Mobilized To Check Jehol Offensive 
### 
SHANGHAI, Jan. 22 (A*) â€”Reports
from farflung areas indicate China
is assembling a vast but loosely knit
war machine in Jehol and North
Chihli provinces, where the Chinese
and Japanese are rubbing elbows,
following the Japanese occupation
of Shanhaikwan early in the month.
From as far away as Kalgan
(Chanchiakow) on the Mongolian
frontier, China's northern legions
were reported moving eastward into
Jehol province, while additional
thousands were taking up positions
south of the great wall along the
Tientsin-Shanhaikwan Railway.
Prepare for Thrust
All these forces presumably were
moving preparatory to the antici
pated Japanese thrust toward Jehol
and also possibly into Tientsin and
Peiping.
Estimates of the number of sol
diers included in this concentration
varied from 150,000 to more than a
quarter of a million.
Central Chinese to Aid
In addition, Central Chinese forces
allegedly were pouring northward
into the "war area." Reports were
that the Nationalist government was
sending forces from Honan, South
Chihli, and Shantung provinces, be
lieved to number a quarter of a mil
lion, to the sector.
