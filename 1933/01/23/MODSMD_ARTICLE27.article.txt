Hull Session lliis morning lias elevated its beagle in a
very worthy cause. In fact, there is probably not a worthier
cause on this campus today. Ihe sight of women dancing
together is positively nauseating to the masculine abdomen.
The fact that there are no masculine abdomens present at
sorority rushing sessions to be nauseated will undoubtedly!
give the women a chance to point out that, since the men
don't have to watch it, it is none of their business.
Hut that is just the point. It is very decidedly their
business. It is so much their business that they feel thevj
ought to be given an opportunity to weed out of the social
life of the ('Diversity of which tliev arc so proud, a practice;
that is insulting to the good taste of any thinking indi
rlie sororities, with one notable exception, wanted, be-i
fore this morning, to have their rushees danced with. Now,'
after somebody said it wasn't such a good idea, they are
undoubtedly bound and determined to have their rushees I
danced with. All right, let them, without, however, violat
ing the long cherished sanctity of man plus woman in]
dance.
The solution is so simple that it is indeed a surprise that
il has not been put forward hitherto. The campus is liter
ally crowded with men, among them some plenty sweet!
dancers, who are seeking employment. Much as some of!
them might dislike becoming gigolos, a chance for some |
very easy money would be suflicient reason for pushing
their pride into the background until they had incorporated
and made an honorable and respected industry out of
gigoloing.
Organized, they could set up a central oflice, to which
sorority women would phone, during rushing, to ask vcrvi
sweetly if they had any fresh gigolos today. The manager
could prices on the ordinary variety, with cer
tain premiums for especially good dancers, and higher!
premiums for big shots. Say a dollar for ordinary, buck
fifty for smoothies, and two fish for a grid captain.
That certainly looks like a very line plan to remedy I
a very nasty situation. The women ought to be content,
since they would still have their rushees danced with.
And think of the number of men it would emplov on a
campus where jobs are indeed scarce.
