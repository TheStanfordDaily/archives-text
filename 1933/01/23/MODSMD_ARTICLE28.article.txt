# ROOMS FOR RENT!
## 
### 
I'nknown to tin 1 vast majority of the students on the 1
Farm, is tin* fact that there are now rooms to'be had
in Sequoia, Encina, Rranner, and Toyou. The average rent I
demanded for any of these rooms is eight dollars per
month.
The Student Committee unearthed the presence of these
vacancies in connection with the problem of rooming for
transfers. The fact that no one on the campus seemed to
know that there were rooms to be had points to a lack of
co-operation between the Dean of Men's oflice and the I
students.
The basic evil seems to lie in the fact that the Dean of
Men's office is overworked. This office should not have to;
handle the rooming problem. Investigation revealed that
the correspondence required to rent one room in Kneina
amounted to four or more letters from this oflice alone.
Obviously in dealing with 500 students a tremendous
amount of secretarial work is required. The true function
of this olliee lias been hampered to a considerable degree.!
However, as a practical suggestion for immediate ac
tion. a list of available rooms should he given The Daily.'
At the beginning of each quarter a similar list could be
prepared.
At present a student is required to go to the Dean's of
fice and inquire. Red tape has amazing qualities of re- 1
strain!, especially when you are a bit lazy!
