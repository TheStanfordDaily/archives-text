\<>w, the question is, why?
The other day some young fellows who listen to the
radio programs, and who dote upon the Magic Carpet,
walked into the I'nion and ordered two packages of a cer
tain brand of cigarettes, laving two-hits on the counter. II
didn't seem to mailer that the, manufacturers had been ad-!
verlising "two for a quarter throughout the country." The
I'nion just wasn't in the country.
And, later in the evening, the same fellows went lo the
I'nion soda fountain and ordered a quart bottle of ginger
ale, of a brand which sells for nineteen cents a bottle in
Palo Alio, with a nickel back when you return Ihc hot tie J
Thirty cents .... only thirty cents at the Union .... one
of the better bargains.
Perhaps a while handkerchief, lied around Iho lower
half of the I'nion basher's face would improve upon the
regulation white uniform he now wears. After all, the
trade uniform should rellecl something of Ihc nature of the
business
