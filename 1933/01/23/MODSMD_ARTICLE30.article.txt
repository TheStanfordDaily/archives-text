# BULL SESSION
## WOMEN WITHOUT MEN 
### 
With a fanfare of hugs, kisses, and
saccharine congratulations, Women's
Rushing for 1933 came to its cus
tomary finis. The lambs have been
rushed, fed, distributed, trade
marked, and will now proceed to be
shorn of their woolly checks-from
home for the next four years. Rush
ing is a very long and involved
process and only the amusing, if sad,
results on Pledging Night justify the
whole thing.
As is well known, the principal
factor in women's rushing is feeding
the darlings in the super-sorority
style—which means that hashers
who drop dishes, spill soup, and
sing in the kitchen are absolutely
taboo. The dames also are on pa
rade—they don formals, pull their
elbows below the table—and in all
things are perfect ladies.
But the big riot, as we see it,
breaks after the last calory has
slipped between their most carefully
rouged lips. Eating is over at be
tween 7:30 and 8 p.m., and the lambs
are not led to the Roble fold till
8:30 p.m. What to do in that half
hour or so? The normal thing one
might imagine, would be to talk
with the frosh—separate the sheep
from the goats, or rather the an
goras from the alley cats.
But no, the sorority women in all
the houses but one, DANCE with
the frosh. There are no men avail
able so the erstwhile sorority sirens
do the leading. They forget their
well-tailored feminity and lead the
frosh around in a romantic waltz, a
collegiate fox-trot, and maybe even
a tantalizing tango! It's thrilling to
watch—that's clear. Two by two,
they go by—gay couples (of women)

gliding to the best the radio or rec
ords can offer.
The asininity of the procedure
reaches its peak when the sorority
babes decide to give some lamb the
rush act —and cut in on her again
and again to the bewilderment of
the frosh. This shows the lamb that
she is popular. But what kind of
ego-exkminaiton can a woman get
to kifcow that other women enjoy
dancing with her?
After dinner, it is probably ac
ceptable even though a bit puerile
for a pair of girls to kill fifteen min
utes with some scuffling on the
hardwood. But to organize this uni
sexual dancing—to make it THE
thing of rushing—to use it as THE
way to impress the frosh—is posi
tively revolting. Stanford men are
supposed to be the upper live per
cent. That means that Stanford wo
men are the upper three-tenths of
one per cent—two-tenths over the
non-alcoholic content, and sup
posedly intelligent enough to curry
on a conversation.
With years of exposure to things
cultural, sorority rushers must turn
to dancing as the medium of deter
mining desirable frosh, and im
pressing frosh with their own status.
It's the worst kick-in-the-pants that
university education has suffered for
many years.
Can it be that Stanford women
are being neglected? Do they crave
more dancing than 3,000 men can
supply? Are our "500" hungry for
romance? Maybe that's the reason
they seem to relish this dancing as
at least a semblance of customary
bi-sexual sociability.

who drop dishes, spill soup, and
sing in the kitchen are absolutely
taboo. The dames also are on pa
rade—they don formals, pull their
elbows below the table—and in all
things are perfect ladies.
But the big riot, as we see it,
breaks after the last calory has
slipped between their most carefully
rouged lips. Eating is over at be
tween 7:30 and 8 p.m., and the lambs
are not led to the Roble fold till
8:30 p.m. What to do in that half
hour or so? The normal thing one
might imagine, would be to talk
with the frosh—separate the sheep
from the goats, or rather the an
goras from the alley cats.
But no, the sorority women in all
the houses but one, DANCE with
the frosh. There are no men avail
able so the erstwhile sorority sirens
do the leading. They forget their
well-tailored feminity and lead the
frosh around in a romantic waltz, a
collegiate fox-trot, and maybe even
a tantalizing tango! It's thrilling to
watch—that's clear. Two by two,
they go by—gay couples (of women)

gliding to the best the radio or rec
ords can offer.
The asininity of the procedure
reaches its peak when the sorority
babes decide to give some lamb the
rush act —and cut in on her again
and again to the bewilderment of
the frosh. This shows the lamb that
she is popular. But what kind of
ego-exkminaiton can a woman get
to kifcow that other women enjoy
dancing with her?
After dinner, it is probably ac
ceptable even though a bit puerile
for a pair of girls to kill fifteen min
utes with some scuffling on the
hardwood. But to organize this uni
sexual dancing—to make it THE
thing of rushing—to use it as THE
way to impress the frosh—is posi
tively revolting. Stanford men are
supposed to be the upper live per
cent. That means that Stanford wo
men are the upper three-tenths of
one per cent—two-tenths over the
non-alcoholic content, and sup
posedly intelligent enough to curry
on a conversation.
With years of exposure to things
cultural, sorority rushers must turn
to dancing as the medium of deter
mining desirable frosh, and im
pressing frosh with their own status.
It's the worst kick-in-the-pants that
university education has suffered for
many years.
Can it be that Stanford women
are being neglected? Do they crave
more dancing than 3,000 men can
supply? Are our "500" hungry for
romance? Maybe that's the reason
they seem to relish this dancing as
at least a semblance of customary
bi-sexual sociability.

With a fanfare of hugs, kisses, and
saccharine congratulations, Women's
Rushing for 1933 came to its cus
tomary finis. The lambs have been
rushed, fed, distributed, trade
marked, and will now proceed to be
shorn of their woolly checks-from
home for the next four years. Rush
ing is a very long and involved
process and only the amusing, if sad,
results on Pledging Night justify the
whole thing.
As is well known, the principal
factor in women's rushing is feeding
the darlings in the super-sorority
style—which means that hashers
who drop dishes, spill soup, and
sing in the kitchen are absolutely
taboo. The dames also are on pa
rade—they don formals, pull their
elbows below the table—and in all
things are perfect ladies.
