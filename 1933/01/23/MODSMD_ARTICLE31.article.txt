LETTER WRITERS OF THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 1 —
Sir Richard Steele.
In all the vast pile of correspond
ence originated by the letter writers
to be discussed in this and following
articles, that of Steele is unique in
its brevity. There are some long let
ters, particularly those addressed to
Mrs Scurlock during Steele's court
ship, but even they are not remark
able for length. After this period the
content of each succeeding letter
shrinks amazingly until at l;ist notes
of a single line arc quite frequent.
There are occasional relapses into a
more flowing style, letters to Pope,
Swift, or Addison, business letters
for the most part. But on the whole
Steele expressed himself shortly, be- [
lieving no doubt that brevity was the
soul of wit.
A considerable part of the letters
are tiny dispatches sent to warn
Mrs Steele, "Dear Prue," that her
lord and master would not be at
home at the expected time: 'Dear
Prue, I dine with Lord Halifax and
shall be home half hour after six.
For thee I die, for thee I languish.
Rich. Steele."
From the affectionate tone of this !
letter and of innumerable others it
is hard to picture the Xantippe-like
Mrs Steele that Swift has drawn in
his Journal to Stella; but there are
many which mention quarrels. In
two of them Steele was piquod and

quite determined to show his au
thority. He writes very formally:
"Madame, I have your letter, where
in you let me know that the little
dispute we had is far from being a
trouble to you; nevertheless, I as
sure you that any disturbance be
tween us is the greatest affliction to
me imaginable ... I write all this
rather to explain my own thoughts
to you than to answer your letter
distinctly. I enclose it to you thai,
upon second thoughts, you may see
the disrespectful manner in which
you treat your affectionate, faithful
husband, Rich. Steele." This display
of severity is rare. Usually Steele
was most abject, but his affection
did not wane; he remained as ro
mantically in love as one of the
creatures in his plays.
Many of these letters have the
same flavor of intimacy which is af
forded by Pepy's diary, little per
sonal touches that, would be impos
sible in a more carefully polished
form of communication. There is the
delightful instance of the twenty
nine walnuts sent to Dear Prue and
as a postscript: "Since I writ the
above I have found half a hundred
more walnuts, which I send here
with." And the absurd signature: "I
am, dear Prue, a little in drink, but
at all times your faithful husband,
Rich. Steele." Another has a similar
postscript: "I am very sick with too
much wine last night."
Many are the mentions of his
scarcity of money: "Dear Prue, I
send you all the money I can spare,
which is four guineas—l keep but
half as much in my pocket." Or,
"Dear Prue, —I send you al Ithe
money I have, which I hope will
bring you to town." This is a nice
picture of the spendthrift, careless
Steele, who, despite his own failings,
wrote to reform the times.
