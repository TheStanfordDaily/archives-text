The Editor, Sir:
In your issue of today, an editorial
states that Rugby has been dead for
ten years in the United States. May
I remind you that this sport is being
played by Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton students and by several
clubs in the East. It is considered an
informal sport and is enjoyed by the
players of the several clubs.

«
Rugby is a wonderful game for
the students and is certainly more
spectacular and more fun than soc
cer. There is no reason why the stu
dents should not play Rugger rather
than touch football. After one knows
the game, pick-up teams can be or
ganized at any time, just as such
teams are organized on the spur of
' the moment in baseball.
• Here's hoping that Rugger comes
| back as a minor or informal sport
: on the campus. —W. W. Behlow, '07
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. James Sandoe needs to be told
that his closing remark in answer
j to Mr. Brill's criticism was not in
| good taste. Mr. Brill made an hon
est, manly statement of his opinion,
a statement that was, on the whole,
1 a masterpiece of its kind, and which
certainly did not merit his being ,
I thrust into Mr. Sandoe's Gehenna.
Mr. Sandoe has a good sense of
critical values, but he wasn't using
j it Monday, nor was he today in his
rationalizing answer to Mr. Brill. In
the first place a critic's job is to be
| the authority on the subject with
which he is dealing. If he is not, he
; should leave it alone. And whoever
, told Mr. Sandoe that the blurby ad
l vance pictures sent out by producers
1 were a fair sample of the real value
j of a picture? The purpose of these
I blurbs is to entice the general pub
lic, not to satisfy critical require
| ments. Often it seems that their
j primary purpose is actually to hide
! the qualities for which critics look.
1 And also, why should Mr. Sandoe, j
j as a critic, be interested, either be- !
fore or after he has made his criti
' cism, in what other critics say? j
j Criticism is not a game in which one
: tries either to agree or to disagree
j with other critics. We read Mr. San
\ doe's work, and we do read it, for
his own judgments. And he wastes
i our time when he tells us that be-
I cause an actress has done mediocre
j work, her current picture must be,
i or that because other critics have
| said that the picture was bad he
\ would have said so too. What we
j want to know from him, if anything,
j is whether this particular piece of
: work is, in his judgment, good.
As for Miss Chatterton's acting, I
1 am no authority, but I do know that
Mr. Sandoe should be the last one

to criticize her for always actingj
a la Miss Chatterton, for all the i
campus actors that merit the name, j
and I consider him one of the best, |
he is the one whose particular per- !
sonalitv is most likely to be ever- ,
present in his acting. Which is no j
fault, if the emotional values of the J
work being done are properly real- .
ized. It just means that he, and Miss j
Chatterton, are not "character ac- j
tors. Probably the greatest actors are j
not. The deepest emotions, of love ;
and fear and awe, which are subjects j
of the greatest acting, go beyond j
characterization, and show the com- j
mon, not the differential, elements of '
man.
However, my purpose is not to ad- j
vance a theory of anything, but to
ask Mr. Sandoe not to write just for
the sake of writing, but to write only
when he has something, of his own,
to say. And to ask him to treat the i
statements of others with respect.

The Editor, Sir:
In your issue of today, an editorial
states that Rugby has been dead for
ten years in the United States. May
I remind you that this sport is being
played by Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton students and by several
clubs in the East. It is considered an
informal sport and is enjoyed by the
players of the several clubs.

«
Rugby is a wonderful game for
the students and is certainly more
spectacular and more fun than soc
cer. There is no reason why the stu
dents should not play Rugger rather
than touch football. After one knows
the game, pick-up teams can be or
ganized at any time, just as such
teams are organized on the spur of
' the moment in baseball.
• Here's hoping that Rugger comes
| back as a minor or informal sport
: on the campus. —W. W. Behlow, '07
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. James Sandoe needs to be told
that his closing remark in answer
j to Mr. Brill's criticism was not in
| good taste. Mr. Brill made an hon
est, manly statement of his opinion,
a statement that was, on the whole,
1 a masterpiece of its kind, and which
certainly did not merit his being ,
I thrust into Mr. Sandoe's Gehenna.
Mr. Sandoe has a good sense of
critical values, but he wasn't using
j it Monday, nor was he today in his
rationalizing answer to Mr. Brill. In
the first place a critic's job is to be
| the authority on the subject with
which he is dealing. If he is not, he
; should leave it alone. And whoever
, told Mr. Sandoe that the blurby ad
l vance pictures sent out by producers
1 were a fair sample of the real value
j of a picture? The purpose of these
I blurbs is to entice the general pub
lic, not to satisfy critical require
| ments. Often it seems that their
j primary purpose is actually to hide
! the qualities for which critics look.
1 And also, why should Mr. Sandoe, j
j as a critic, be interested, either be- !
fore or after he has made his criti
' cism, in what other critics say? j
j Criticism is not a game in which one
: tries either to agree or to disagree
j with other critics. We read Mr. San
\ doe's work, and we do read it, for
his own judgments. And he wastes
i our time when he tells us that be-
I cause an actress has done mediocre
j work, her current picture must be,
i or that because other critics have
| said that the picture was bad he
\ would have said so too. What we
j want to know from him, if anything,
j is whether this particular piece of
: work is, in his judgment, good.
As for Miss Chatterton's acting, I
1 am no authority, but I do know that
Mr. Sandoe should be the last one

to criticize her for always actingj
a la Miss Chatterton, for all the i
campus actors that merit the name, j
and I consider him one of the best, |
he is the one whose particular per- !
sonalitv is most likely to be ever- ,
present in his acting. Which is no j
fault, if the emotional values of the J
work being done are properly real- .
ized. It just means that he, and Miss j
Chatterton, are not "character ac- j
tors. Probably the greatest actors are j
not. The deepest emotions, of love ;
