### Dave Cooke 
Stanford's temperamental fresh
an basketball team turned in its
■st game of the year Saturday in
ie new California gym to upset the
ear Cubs, 40 to 30. Disregarding
leir erratic early season perform
ices, the Papooses displayed ;■ fast,
nooth brand of basketball that
impletely outclassed their tradi
onal rivals.
Starting from scratch at half-time
hen the score was tied at 16-all,
le potential Indians took the of
nsive and held a safe lead till the
rial gun. Only once in the second
riod did the Berkeley frosh
ireaten to tie the score. At this
lint the Stanford defense tightened
id the Cubs were forced to try
>ng shots. ,
Niglhingalc I ligfli Scorer
Nigthingale, of California won
i li scoring honors with a total of
I points. This elusive forward and
is teammate Carney accounted for
iost of the California scores on long
i rows.
Barnett, who turned in a stellar
rformance for Stanford, took sec
nd-place honors with 13 points de
»ite the fact that he held down a
uard position. Mannion scored 10
oints for the Cardinal team and
.is outstanding in keeping the ball
i Bear territory. He recovered the
p-off from his teammate Greenlee
Imost every time and managed to
p in the right place to break up
ll'ensive plays. Coach John Bunn of
le Stanford varsity has already
ated that he considers Mannion an
utstanding forward because of his
insistent ability to hit the basket.
Greenlee Gets .Jump
Although Greenlee outjumped the
pposing center a majority of the
mos, his eye for the basket was not
i good. Farber, another aggressive
uard, scored several points while
ot busy protecting the Stanford
oal. The Cardinal guards between
iem accounted for 20 of the 40
oints scored.
Both teams were hitting the basket
insistently, as the high score indi
ces. Forwards and guards were
inking long shots from difficult
ngles.
Tomorrow night the frosh meet
.owell High in what should prove
n interesting encounter, and if
'oach Bradshaw's squad can keep
p Ihe pace set last Saturday the
rep team will have its hands full,
.owell was defeated 27 to 16 by the
'a! frosh last week.
