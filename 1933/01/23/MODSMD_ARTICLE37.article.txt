FOR REASONS THAT have never
been clearly discernible to this
paltry reporter, coaches of athletic
teams are always held responsible
for the conduct of five or nine or
eleven muscular individuals who
perform to the best of their ability
(and momentary inclination or
mood) in games in which the
coaches do nothing but sit on the
bench and wave their arms and
whisper significant if soon forgotten
instructions to substitutes before al
lowing them to lope excitedly and
joyfully into the fray.
Therefore Rabbit James Brad
shavv of Nevada is a hero today
because his Stanford freshmen
surprisingly trounced the Cali
fornia yearlings Saturday. And
John W. Bunn of Kansas is a
bum today: his Stanford varsity
played surprisingly lousy bas
kcthall to lose to the California
varsity Saturday. Yet Bradshaw
did not score even a single free
throw or make even a single
disconcerting yell in the game.
And Bunn didn't make a single
bad pass and there are no
"missed set-ups" after Kansas
John's name in the record sheets.
OF COURSE, one occasionally
hears that a coach is handicapped by
poor material, but this really has
nothing to do with the calibre of the
teams he "produces." If the mentor
mentions the glaring fact after a loss,
it is the sour grapes gripe of a poor
loser; if he suggests before the game
that the opposition is stronger, it is
called coaches' pessimism. Some
times even a Los Angeles newspaper
intimates that the winning team is
also the team with the best players,
but this is considered, in sporting
circles, more of a coincidence than
a cause and effect relationship.
Now all of this is not meant
to signify that Stanford lost to
California Saturday because
Stanford was completely out
classed in manpower. Stanford
lost because California played

less poor basketball. And that
phrase was carefully chosen:
California was rotten, but Stan
ford was worse.
To prove the point statistically:
Stanford's defense fell to pieces in
the second half; Captain Cordry,
who has been averaging about 25
per cent of his shots made one out of
fourteen Saturday; John Hancock
and Keith Topping, two of Stan
ford's most potent offensive threats,
took but five shots between them;
Carrel Weaver, after .sinking his first
three attempts underwent a bad at
tack of butter fingers; and even re
liable Jay Tod was out of position
a couple of times.
WHICH BRINGS US to a very
difficult reportorial point of strategy.
The time of the Great Decision has
arrived. If we praise or excuse the
Stanford showing, the campus will
accuse the Daily of Polly-Anna ten
dencies; if we criticize the Stanford
showing, the team will claim that it
is not receiving proper support.
Being fearful of extremes, we
shall print the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help us God. Stanford was
nervous and distinctly "cold"
Saturday, in spite of the It to 4
early Cardinal lead.
BUNN HAD TAKEN all precau
tions to safeguard that game. The
team had gone to Berkeley early; it
had worked out in the new audi
torium; it. had napped peacefully in
the afternoon and had dressed ner
vously in the evening. And then it
went out and played its worst game
to date.
Perhaps it was too much
preparation. Anyway, Bunn said
Saturday night after the game
that lie was going to take the
boys on a fishing trip before the
next U.C. encounter. "Or may
be," finished John from Kansas,
"I'll just tell them that I have
heard that we arc playing Cal on
Saturday and, if they aren't too
busy, to drop down to the I'a-

vilion and get dressed by eight
or nine o'clock—if they feel like
it." —D.S.

called coaches' pessimism. Some
times even a Los Angeles newspaper
intimates that the winning team is
also the team with the best players,
but this is considered, in sporting
circles, more of a coincidence than
a cause and effect relationship.
Now all of this is not meant
to signify that Stanford lost to
California Saturday because
Stanford was completely out
classed in manpower. Stanford
lost because California played

less poor basketball. And that
phrase was carefully chosen:
California was rotten, but Stan
ford was worse.
To prove the point statistically:
Stanford's defense fell to pieces in
the second half; Captain Cordry,
who has been averaging about 25
per cent of his shots made one out of
fourteen Saturday; John Hancock
and Keith Topping, two of Stan
ford's most potent offensive threats,
took but five shots between them;
Carrel Weaver, after .sinking his first
three attempts underwent a bad at
tack of butter fingers; and even re
liable Jay Tod was out of position
a couple of times.
WHICH BRINGS US to a very
difficult reportorial point of strategy.
The time of the Great Decision has
arrived. If we praise or excuse the
Stanford showing, the campus will
accuse the Daily of Polly-Anna ten
dencies; if we criticize the Stanford
showing, the team will claim that it
is not receiving proper support.
Being fearful of extremes, we
shall print the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help us God. Stanford was
nervous and distinctly "cold"
Saturday, in spite of the It to 4
early Cardinal lead.
BUNN HAD TAKEN all precau
tions to safeguard that game. The
team had gone to Berkeley early; it
had worked out in the new audi
torium; it. had napped peacefully in
the afternoon and had dressed ner
vously in the evening. And then it
went out and played its worst game
to date.
Perhaps it was too much
preparation. Anyway, Bunn said
Saturday night after the game
that lie was going to take the
boys on a fishing trip before the
next U.C. encounter. "Or may
be," finished John from Kansas,
"I'll just tell them that I have
heard that we arc playing Cal on
Saturday and, if they aren't too
busy, to drop down to the I'a-

vilion and get dressed by eight
or nine o'clock—if they feel like
it." —D.S.
FOR REASONS THAT have never
been clearly discernible to this
paltry reporter, coaches of athletic
teams are always held responsible
for the conduct of five or nine or
eleven muscular individuals who
perform to the best of their ability
(and momentary inclination or
mood) in games in which the
coaches do nothing but sit on the
bench and wave their arms and
whisper significant if soon forgotten
instructions to substitutes before al
lowing them to lope excitedly and
joyfully into the fray.
Therefore Rabbit James Brad
shavv of Nevada is a hero today
because his Stanford freshmen
surprisingly trounced the Cali
fornia yearlings Saturday. And
John W. Bunn of Kansas is a
bum today: his Stanford varsity
played surprisingly lousy bas
kcthall to lose to the California
varsity Saturday. Yet Bradshaw
did not score even a single free
throw or make even a single
disconcerting yell in the game.
And Bunn didn't make a single
bad pass and there are no
"missed set-ups" after Kansas
John's name in the record sheets.
OF COURSE, one occasionally
hears that a coach is handicapped by
poor material, but this really has
nothing to do with the calibre of the
teams he "produces." If the mentor
mentions the glaring fact after a loss,
it is the sour grapes gripe of a poor
loser; if he suggests before the game
that the opposition is stronger, it is
called coaches' pessimism. Some
times even a Los Angeles newspaper
intimates that the winning team is
also the team with the best players,
but this is considered, in sporting
circles, more of a coincidence than
a cause and effect relationship.
