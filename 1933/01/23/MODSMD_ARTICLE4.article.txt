# CLUB WILL GIVE FRENCH READING
## Play Thursday Backed By Sword And Sandals 
### 
Sword and Sandals will sponsor
the first foreign language reading of
a play on the campus in some years
when the French Club holds an open
meeting at 7:30 o'clock Thursday in
the Little Theatre.
The play selected for the reading
is Moliere's rapid farce, "Le Medecin
Malgre Lui," first performed in 1666
and one of the most popular of his
comedies ever since.
Casting has been completed and
reading rehearsals are well under
way. Wayne Bannister, campus de
bater and occasional thespian, will
read the role of Sganarelle, "the
doctor in spite of himself." Bannister
took part last year in the Sword and
Sandals reading of John Van Dru
ten's "Young Woodley" but this is
his first major role.
Beck in Important Role
Martine, wife of Sganarelle, un
impressed by his classical learning
and something of a shrew, will be
read by Florence Jones. Franklin
Baker is to be Monsieur Robert, a
neighbor. Jean Robert Beck, native
of Alsace and at present an instruc
tor in the German Department, will
read the important role of Geronte,
father to the designingly speechless
Lucir.de (Elizabeth Wicher).
Bromley Smith, who returned a
short time ago from two European
years as a foreign correspondent,
will be Leandre, Lucinde's lover.
Other characters in the play include
Jacqueline, nurse of Gcronte's
younger children (Trubee Wads
worth), her husband, Lucas (Rich
ard Rathman), and Valere, another
servant in Geronte's household
(Theodore Shaw).

enced in the French language. Flor
ence Jones instructed abroad for
two years, Mrs. Wadsworth attended
the Lycee of Versailles for three
years, while others of the cast have
traveled on the Continent.

Languages Department, besides aid
