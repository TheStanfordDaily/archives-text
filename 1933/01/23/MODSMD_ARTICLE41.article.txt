# STANFORD RUGBY CLUB IN INTRA-TEAM PRACTICE GAME WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Ghandi's All-Stars vs. Aimee's
Choir.
That's the lineup for the first local
rugby game to be played here at
4:30 o'clock Wednesday afternoon.
The two teams will be composed
of Stanford's motley group of rugger
adepts, and they will meet in what
amounts to a practice session in
preparation for Saturday afternoon's
game (to be played at Stanford)
with the Barbarian All-Blacks of
San Francisco. In this latter game
the rather senile campus players
(most of them were stars a decade

ago) will be known as the Stanford
Rugby Club.
Norman Cleaveland, a lightweight
of considerable speed and field-goal
ability, is managing the Stanford
club, and he has procured the ser
vices of varsity stars Bill Sim and
Tex Walker, two "speedies" who
will cavort on P.C.C. gridirons next.
Cleaveland is of the opinion that
these two rugger neophytes may de
velop into fine material for the
American Olympic team in 1936. The
eleventh Olympiad will include
rugby.
