## 
### BOB WADE 
Showing the same power on of -
fense and defense that won him his
All-American berth seven reasons
ago, Ernie Nevers led his Pacific
Coast All-Stars to a 13-6 upset vic
tory over the Green Bay Packers in
yesterday's Knights of Columbus
professional football game for char
ity at Kezar Stadium.
The Packers drew first blood in
the second quarter when Hinkle
passed to Nash, good for -16 yards
and a touchdown. The conversion
was wide, but those six digits looked
mighty big where two lines, averag
ing over 225 pounds, allowed only a
scant 163 yards from scrimmage be -
tween them. Nevers' team, incident
ally, collected 94 of them.
Late in the same period Nevers'
team took the ball up to the Packers'
45-yard stripe. On second down Bel
den threw a long pass to Harry Eb
ding, one-time St. Mary's end.
Grove, playing safety for the Pack-

ers, came in to intercept the ball, it
bounced oft' his shoulder, and Eli
ding plucked it out of the air on the
dead run to score standing up.
Nevers converted nicely. Score:
Packers 6, Nevers 7.
The All-Stars held onto their slim
lead until well into the third stanza,
when they managed to work the
ball down to the Packers' 17-yard
line. Nevers faded back again on
second down, picked out "Wild Rill"
McKalip, former Oregon State end,
and tossed him a 7-yard pass. Mc-
Kalip zig-zagged his way the re
maining 10 yards. Nevers' conversion
was wide.
With minutes to go, the Packers
started throwing the ball all over
the lot, and drove to the Stars' 7-
yards in three attempts, punted, and
on downs. Nevers punched out eight
yords in three attempts, punted, and
the game was over as the Packers
hurled two incomplete passes.
