### 
Showing a large collection of
I books, articles, and presentations
! written or contributed by past and
present members of the English Club
of Stanford, a new exhibit is now on
i display in the main lobby of the
I University Library.
This show is in honor of ihe 31st
j anniversary of the establishment of
the English Club, which was founded
February 14, 1901, by the late Pro
{ fessor Samuel Swayze Seward. The
i purpose of the Stanford literary or
! ganization has been to bring to-
I gether the students who were in
! terested in literary matters, and to
j present to the campus such publica
; tions, plays, and lectures as came
| within the club's interests.
With publications at first limited
i to collections of articles or stories
| appearing at long intervals, the litâ€”
j erary magazine of the campus was
in the hands of an editorial board
' chosen from the student body at
I lai'ge. This publication, namely the
1 "Stanford Sequoia," was taken over
i by the English Club in 1913 with the
| beginning of the 23d volume, and
I the last one was printed in 1928.
! Continuing the idea of an annual
literary publication, the club put out
1 "A Year Book of Stanford Writing"
;in 1930, and succeeding volumes
j have been published in 1931 and
j 1932.
