# ROBBER NETS $172 IN RAID ON 5 HOUSES
## Delta Chi, A.T.O., Phi Kap, Chi Psi, And K.A. Men Suffer 
### 
Entering five fraternity houses
some time between 4 and li o'clock
yesterday morning, a burglar ob
tained a total loot estimated at
$172.50 in cash, two sweaters, a black
bag, and a quantity of cigarettes and
candy.
The houses robbed were Delta
Chi, Alpha Tau Omega, Phi Kappa
Psi, Chi Psi, and Kappa Alpha. Delta
Chi was the heavy loser, $75 being
taken there. In addition, $G0 in trav
elers' checks were removed from
Bob McAfee's clothing and later
thrown into a closet, the thief being
believed to have feared taking some
thing that was easily identifiable.
Clothing Taken
Moving next door into the A.T.O.
house, he fleeced clothing to the
extent of $40, $25 of which was
taken from Lou Phelps.
Half a dozen Phi Kappa Psi men
contributed to the $30 estimated to
have been taken there. One of the
members who had gone to bed
shortly after 3 o'clock said last night
that he believed he heard someone
moving around the house about 4
o'clock, but thought it was another
Phi Psi checking in late.
Residents of the Chi Psi lodge
reported $15, two sweaters, and the
black bag missing, while Kappa Al
pha losses were figured at $12.50,
plus a quantity of cigarettes and
candy that were kept in a second
n â€¢ *
floor commissary.
Delts Undisturbed
Reports that Delta Tau Delta had
been entered were found to be un
true by Officer Gordon Davis, who
is working on the case.
Davis believes that the burglar is
the same one that visited this cam
pus last March and that makes a
living out of robbing fraternity
houses from coast to coast.
