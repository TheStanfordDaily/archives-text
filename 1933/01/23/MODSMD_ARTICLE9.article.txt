# DATE SET FOR PRESENTATION OF "HOLIDAY"
## Newest Campus Drama Due For Presentation On February 3 
### 
Stanford is promised a "Holiday"
on February 3.
That was the date announced last
night for the Dramatic Council's
presentation of Philip Barry's "Holi
day" which Harold Helvenston is
directing.
Rehearsals have been under way
for two weeks, and the production
of the successful Barry play prom
ises to start the winter dramatic
season in a spectacular manner.
Jones Heads Cast
The capable cast is headed by
Marian Jones, whose Linda Seton
will be her first major role on the
Stanford stage. Miss Jones appeared
in two readings, "Home Chat" and
"Of Thee I Sing," to distinct ad
vantage. Linda is the heroine of this
play which tells of a daughter who
rebels against her family's reverance
for riches..

Johnny Case, who wants a holi
day, is played by Jimmy Bcnet, re
cently seen in "Death Takes A Holi
day," and Benet promises to give a
pleasing characterization.
Mary Anita Loos, experienced
campus actress, has the role of Julia
Seton, engaged to Johnny, and
against whom Linda rebels. This
promises to be the best role Miss
Loos has had thus far.
Potters Furnish Fun
Nick Potter, who contributes the
greatest share of the comedy of the
play, will be played by Bob Church
ill. Susan, his wife, will be enacted
by Elizabeth Chapin. These Potters
are the pair who, as Linda says, "get
more fun out of nothing than anyone
I know."
Ned Seton will be played by
Johnny Peckham, who is expected
to give a sterling performance, as is
Joe Wolf, who was so outstanding in
"Death Takes A Holiday."
Others in the cast are Eleanor
Furst, Carter Meyer, and Will Wil
liams.
