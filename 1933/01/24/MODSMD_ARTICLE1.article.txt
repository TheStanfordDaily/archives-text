# BUNN'S QUINTET TO MEET U.C.L.A. HERE FRI., SAT.
## Caddy Works Bringing Up Speedy Bruin Squad For Contests INDIANS SEE CHANCE U.S.C. Overwhelmed Ucla In Game This Year 
### Bob Letts 
Their troubles of the California
game somewhat forgotten, Stanford's
varsity basketball players yesterday
swung into intensive workouts for
their week-end of Pacific Coast Con
ference competition, two fast battles
to be waged here Friday and Satur
day [nights against University of
California at Los Angeles.
Coach John Bunn offered no alibis
for the failure of his players to
maintain the pace they set in the
opening 10 minutes of the Bear
game, and settled down to work to
pit his quintet against a team which
has likewise been defeated by Uni
versity of Southern California.
Dope Is Contradictory
The comparative dope, based on
scores against U.S.C., gives Stanford
a big chance to break into the win
column. Losing by margins of two
and five points, the Cards made a
better showing against the Trojans
than did the Bruins, who lost by
some twenty points. On the other
hand, U.C.L.A.'s showing against
California in two contests was much
better than Stanford's Saturday
night.
Gordon Alter, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, credits U.C.L.A.
with having a much better defense
than California's. After the Bear-
Card tilt last week-end, he gave his
opinion that Stanford would be
much more troubled with the Bruins
than she was in the first half of the
Cal battle.
U.C.L.A. Offense Fast
Reports from the South indicate
that Coach Caddy Works has built
up an offense that boasts an even
quicker fast break than his former
teams have had. The fast break has
always been an integral part of
Works' system, and it should pair
up with the Stanford offense to treat
fans to a pair of interesting struggles.
Past U.C.L.A.-Stanford games have
always been among the best of the
season.
