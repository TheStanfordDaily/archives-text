# SORORITIES' IRE IS RAISED OVER DANCE REBUKES
## Pi Phi's Only Group Using Mellinkoff's Ideas With "Nuggets" 
### 
In -spite of much recent popular j
music about "Dancing in the Dark," !
"Dancing on the Ceiling," and vari- j
ous musical queries as to "Why t
dance?" eight of Stanford's sororities
banded together last night on the
subject of rushing "a la danse."
The women from Pi Beta Phi
alone, which is the only house that
does not dance, remained staunch
supporters of the opinions expressed
by Abe MellinkofT, Daily Bull Ses
sionist, with this declaration by
Betts Hawkins:
Hawkins' Statement
"Assuming that the object in
rushing is to find that group of
freshmen which is most congenial
to the house and to judge the merit
of freshmen rather than superficial
appearances I )fail to understand
why dancing should have any place
in rushing."
"That for Mr. MellinkofT," shouted
the Delta Gammas. "It's none of his
business. 1 We'll keep on dancing.
Why not?"
Declining to x - eply to the "posi
tively nauseating" editorial and Bull ,
Session, the Alpha O's added through
Eunice Force that "Two dollars per
hour for a gigolo, even a Stanford
gigolo, does not appeal to the upper
.3 of 1 per cent."
"What Else?"
Nancy Jones, Alpha Phi president,
asked if the martyred MellinkofT
could possibly make the acquaint
ance of 12 or 14 people with some
method other than dancing or bridge.
That dancing is as meritorious as
playing ping pong on fraternity front
porches was expressed by Janis Mc-
Creadic, Tri Delt president. She
said, "Mr. MellinkofT is so familiar
with the intimacies of women's rush
ing that he would appreciate an
honorary membership in Pan-Hel
lnic, for his views might carry
weight."
"Easiest Way"
Barbara Binns, Chi Omega Rush
Captain, and Mary Rath of the
Thetas, joined in the opinion that
dancing is silly, but the easiest way
in which the Greeks may become
acquainted with the rushees.
The Kappas believe that the ques
tion is a matter for each individual
house to decide and not for public
discussion while Gamma Phi Beta
as a body backed the suggestion
that MellinkofT find something else
for the houses to do rather than to
dance.
