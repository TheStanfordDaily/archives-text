"From Two-Seater Bicycle Riding
to Dancing at the Frantic; Or, Why
Girls Choose Stanford" might well
be the title of the history of local
co-educational progress.
Information gleaned from musty
files of the Daily (then the Daily
Palo Alto) shows that tandem bi
cycle riding was one of the favorite
outdoor sports of the gay nineties.
All dances ended at 10 o'clock;
every evening the lights over the
whole University were switched out
at 10:30 o'clock.
The question of what to do on
Friday nights was simple. There
were no movies in Palo Alto, no
hotel dancing. Friday night was
calling night at Roblo. Campus play
boys of the nineties would spend
from seven to nine on Friday eve

nings sitting in Roble lobby with
their love of the moment discussing
literature and the latest tennis
match. At nine lemonade and
cookies would be served, and then
the evening's dissipation was over.
Practically all the girls had only
one best dress. Their occupations
were sewing and letter-writing.
But life wasn't without its lighter
aspects. The Glee Club tryouts were
held at Roble, and the girls used to
look forward to seeing the embar
rassed men essay their first har
mony.
In the early years of this century,
campus women nearly outnumbered
the men. For some time the ratio
was only two men for every woman,
rather than -the present flapper's
ideal of six to one.
