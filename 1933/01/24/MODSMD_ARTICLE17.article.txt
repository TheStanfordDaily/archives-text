### 
Five possibilities now remain un
der consideration by the Theatre
Fund Committee for its spring mu
sical show. After tv/o hours of care
ful comparison at its meeting yes
terday, "Hit the Deck," "Pirates of
Penzance," "Green, Grow the Li
lacs," "Girl Crazy," and "Good
News'' were voted the best and most
capable of production of all the sug
gestions received.
All of these are considered by the
committee to contain good music, as
well as enough drama and humor to
appeal to tastes on the Farm. Most
important in further consideration
of the five selections will be cost—
loyalties, scenery, orchestrations,
and the like. Investigations are now
under way as to the practicability
of producing each show.
"Hit the Deck" is chiefly remem
bered for the famous Hallelujah
Chorus. "Good News" has a colle
giate setting, and includes the "Var
sity Drag" and "Lucky in Love" in
its musical score. "Girl Crazy" and
"Green Grow the Lilacs" both have
western settings. The former is re
membered for "I Got Rhythm"; the
latter has never been produced in
the West, but was a favorite in other
parts of the country.
Gilbert and Sullivan's well-known
"Pirates of Penzance" is the only
operetta remaining on the list; all
the others are successful musical
comedies of the last few years.
Among other recommendations to
the committee were "Follow Thru,"
"Spring Is Here," "Sweet Adeline,"
and "You Said It." The committee
was well pleased with the interest
manifested by the students, all the
pi'oductions still under consideration
being suggested by several indi
viduals.
