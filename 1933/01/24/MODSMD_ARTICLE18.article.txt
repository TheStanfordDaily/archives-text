### 
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 23 (/P) â€” Jean
Sullivan and Charles Frank Mc-
Curdy Jr. were taken away from
the scene of their wedding here to
day in an ambulance.
At first blush it seemed a tragic
way to begin a honeymoon, but later
il was revealed as a clever ruse to
outwit the bridegroom's fraternity
brothers who had armed themselves
with some particularly heavy and
worn shoes.
The young couple said good-by to
the guests and then asked a five
minute armistice in the rice-throw
ing to bid adieu to an invalid friend
whe had arrived in ihe ambulance.
Before the others got wise the am
bulance and the couple had dis
appeared.
