# Pop Will See His 1st Rugby Tilt Saturday
## Former Warner Players In Exhibition 
### 
Pop Warner has never been to a
rugby game in his life. Saturday
afternoon he plans to attend one.
Coach Warner will sit aloft in the
press box, deserting his old accus
tomed spot on the bench. Sports
writers, enjoying Pop's company,
find it their first game as well, and
are hesitant over the approved rugby
typewriter patter.
What the spectators will see, ac
cording to Pop, is a pair of teams
"dressed in something like track
suits, except for the spiked shoes;
playing with a swollen ball alien to
the American lootball eye, and run
ning in open play like basketball."
There is no familiar pattern of
play formation, if checked by Pop's
mental picture of Saturday's game.
"Rugby is speedier than American
football," Warner declared. "Less
intervals of inactivity, simpler for
the spectator, yet marked by pe
culiar strategy. The scrum, taking
place of the kickoff, looks something
like London Bridge."
Dink Templeton, incidentally,
Warner avers, is Stanford's own
rugby genius. He was a member of
the 1924 Olympic team, and in Paris
competition proved himself to be the
star of the United States team which
won the world's championship.
