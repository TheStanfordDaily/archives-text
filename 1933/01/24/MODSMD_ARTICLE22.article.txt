# Union Reduces Price Of Cigarettes To 2 For 25
## 
### 
Rumor that the Stanford Union
had reduced the price of cigarettes
to two packages for twenty-five
cents was confirmed yesterday by
W. R. Gunther, manager of the
Union .store.
Gunther declared that the new
prices left Ihe retailer with but a
15 per cent margin on his sales and
that the resulting small profit made
the cigarette business a hazardous
one. He blamed the large tobacco
companies for forcing such condi
tions upon the shoulders of the small
merchant. As the Union depends
upon the cigarette trade for G5 per
cent of its business it will have to
boost margins on the remainder of
its items.
All the offspring of a common fly
could not be housed in the Empire
State building.
