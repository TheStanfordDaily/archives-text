# RUGBY SQUADS TO TANGLE SATURDAY IN CHARITY GAME
## Profits Will Go Into Fund For Student Relief Student Body President Bill Corbus Names Special Committee to Handle Details of Contest; Famous Stars to Play for Stanford 
### 
lii an attempt to revive rugby as a winter sport and at the same time
provide a painless method of swelling the student unemployment relief
fund, the Stanford Rugby Club will meet the Barbarian AIl-Blaeks in the
Stanford Stadium Saturday afternoon at 2:o0 o'clock. Admission will be
25 cents and there will be no complimentary tickets.
Renewed local interest in the classical game has brought to the fore a
demand to sec just what kind of stulT these ruggers have 011 the ball and
the Students' Relief Committee capitalized on the situation and secured
Saturday's attraction. In this way it is planned to serve two ends: give

the students an opportunity to see
whal rugby is, and at the same time
aid a worthy cause.
Special Committee
Student Body President Bill Cor
bus Inis appointed a special commit
tee to handle the details of the forth
coming contest and the members are
expected to co-operate in making it
a success. Les Hables will preside as
chairman of the group and assisting
him are Ike Livermore, Fred Glover,
Jerry Hampton, Ken Churchill,
Frank Fullenwider, John Ulrich, Si
Thomas, Marion Hewlett, Barbara
Steinbeck, Zoie Ann Hill, Marian
Wheeler, and Margaret Friedman.
Chairman Hables said last night,
"Considering that rugby as a game
is almost universally played it is
strange that there has been a dearth
of interest in it here in the United
States. In Olympic competition, soc
cer is ranked first, rugby second, and
track third, as attractions. In view
of this, it is probable that the pres
ent revival wiil have a iasting effect,
and Stanford is fortunate in having
the first of these 'revival' games
played right here on the campus."
Spectacular Gamo
The game is spectacular, features
the open field running that brings
crowds to their feet in football, and,
above all, weather here on the Coast,
is ideal during that period which
follows the regular gridiron season
when we have no outdoor sport.
The Stanford Club is coached by
Jim Wylie, a one-time member of
the famous New Zealand All-Blacks,
who are conceded by followers of
the game to have been the best of
all rugby players. Wylie played here
with the 1913 All-Black team that
defeated Stanford 50 to 0 and 54 to 0.
Others out for the team include
Phil Clarke, who played with the
1924 Olympic American team, and
"Seotchy" Campbell, former Stan
ford football captain.
