# READ 'EM AND LAUGH
## 
### 
During Ihc Jasl days of winter when il seems that
spring will never come and tilings are generally cloaked in}
gloom, and depression, there is nothing so good for the!
soul as a healthv laugh.
. . 1
If you thought il was funny to watch the futile flounder-i
iug of Ihc sororities trying to rush under a set of rules j
which apparently has the sole object of preventing the |
houses from rushing, and keeping the freshmen from find-!
ing out that they are hcing rushed, take a squint at these, i
:i few of those rushing rules. Thev comprise only half of'
the staggering total.
* * *
,
"There shall he no meeting on Quad .between new and
sorority women other than that necessitated by class work.
"Houses are strictly forbidden to allow men to partici-j
pale in rushing. This includes influencing rushces in any
way.
"Sororities may not break dates for the freshmen with
other houses. Xo sorority may ask a new woman to break
;i date with another sorority.
"That only one sorority girl lake each freshman home
after rush parlies.
"That sorority girls do not see the rushee to the door
of Roble, but stay in their cars.
" That no house may phone a new woman.
"That in case of confusion about whether the freshman
has accepted or refused a (late, the house president or
rushing chairman phone a sponsor, who will act as contact
with the freshman.
"That articles such as gloves, purse, etc. left by fresh
men at houses at rush parties, be turned over to P-H
President to be delivered at the Roble desk.
"On bidding dav girls shall meet the pledges at the door
and not go out of the house to meet them.
"Panhellenic forbids: (a) Any implication of a bid. (b)
Any offer or implication of financial aid. (c) Uncompli
mentary talk about oilier houses.
"Table decorations are to consist of fruits or flowers,
in howls or in baskets, without mulleen or other trimmings.
Nut cups and place cards are allowed. Table cloths or
doilies, of while or natural colored linen, are to be used.
"There is to be no smoking at rushing functions.
"Hashers are to wear their regular uniforms during
rushing.
"Xo sorority woman can be in a room at Roble with a
new girl even though a sponsor is present.
"Sisters may be together at any time or place, provid
ing no other sorority sister of a new girl is. along.
" The names, grouped according to houses, of the soror
ity girls who have gone on double dales with new women
and the names of the new women and the men on the
double date shall be read in Panhellenic meeting. It is
assumed that such double dates arc unavoidable and un
premeditated. Rut if the sorority girl fails to report the
double date to President of Panhellenic within three days
a penalty shall be imposed. The penally shall be the for
feiting of one rushing dale for the house during the first
week of rushing.
"Sorority women riding together with new women on
the trains or busses must report the matter to the Pan
hellenic President.
"At the time the sororities were granted winter quarter
rushing they agreed to the following: (a) Pled ge duties
would not exceed one hour per week, (b) Pledge meeting
las! from one half to three quarters of an hour no
longer, (c) Pledges would be required to take one meal
per week at the house, with an option of another; that the
houses would abide by the meal schedule made up by Pan
hellenic. (d) Houses will require their pledges to attend
Roble house-meetings, and encourage them to attend Roble
teas, dances, etc."
Anyone reading those selections from the regular rules
would certainly feel that the "girls" had effectively blocked
rushing by the houses, and guarded against the possibilities
that the freshmen would discover that they were being
rushed.
Rut no, they got together last quarter and polished them
( IT in fine style with several line amendments, aijiong them
these:
"Meals lo be of three courses, with no refreshments or
hors d'ocuvres to be served before the meal; food to be
simple with no extra relishes or appetizers.
"Flower decorations to be simple, arranged from cut
Mowers, not floral pieces already made up."
And now. the punch line:
"Further amendments and revisions are to be consid
ered by Panhellenic in llje near future; and definite action
w ill be taken by the regular committee of old officers and
newlv elected officers, in Spring Quarter."
