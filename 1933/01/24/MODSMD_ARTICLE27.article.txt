# BULL SESSION
## "IN CONFERENCE" 
### 
Meetings between the President
elect and the President-elect are be
coming quite the thing. Ever since
the election, Roosevelt has been run
ning in a three-lane rat maze from
Warm Springs, Georgia, to Albany
in New York, and thence to Wash
ington; repeated in that order. Both
men are in a delicate situation.
Hoover can be bold and fearless
for he has no voters to face in 1936
unless, as the know-boys say, he is
planning to run in four years. But
as bold and fearless as he may be,
Hoover also knows he can do abso
lutely nothing before leaving the
White House. The Donkey Congress
is high upon its haunches and seems
lo show no evidence of coming down
until after March 4th.
Roosevelt, on the other hand, is a
perfect vice-versa. He is afraid to
be too bold because he has to play
marbles with Congress for four years
and probably isn't too near-sighted
to see 1936 on the White House cal
endar. And to play marbles with
Huey Long, Carter Glass, Bob La
Follette, etc.—take their marbles
from them—and send the boys back
to the Senate smiling will take great
diplomacy. So far the Democratic
family is more or less one family—
but Papa Roosevelt hasn't had to
feed the boys any spinach yet. The
fun is yet to come. They say Huey
Long doesn't eat any vegetables; de
manding raw beefsteaks at every

meal.
The necessity for these confer
ences between Hoover and Roose
velt of course just goes to show that
Norris' amendment to inaugurate the
President on Januaiy first is a ne
cessity. Just because it took back
woods congressmen four months in
1789 to hot-foot it to the Capital,
Hoover is left dangling in mid-term
with a wild Congress on his hands,
a strong larnyx; but power to do
nothing.
Hoover's position is quite peculiar.
If he had resigned upon his defeat,
as was suggested, and made way for
Roosevelt to jump right into office—
he would have been branded as a
quitter. The fact that he is in office
makes him an obstructionist. The
devil and the deep blue sea were
two paradises in comparison.
Politically, the nation , must mark
time until March 4th, when a new
President and a new Congress step
into power. But nothing waits for
politics but the politicians and they
are usually live steps ahead of the
game. Meanwhile, economic condi
tions continue to strike new lows.
The foreign situation is the worst
it has ever been for some time. Two
wars are in full swing—or at least
a war and one-half. International
debts are hanging fire. And arma
ments continue to continue.
