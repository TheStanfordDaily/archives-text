HOT PEPPER—(Fox)—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
"Hot Pepper" is an inelegant,
rough, rather well-sustained farce
with not too much hip-undulation
and posterior slapping as well as
disrobing to be an amusing film.
Its vulgarity is frank and abrupt
rather than sly; it never masquer
ades as art or drama (see ''Call Her
Savage"); it is rowdy to an un
precedented degree without the
slinging of a single custard.
I should not care to advise it for
the serious and sedate; the roughs
find the broad double entendre
funny indeed. And with the figure
of the female in the cast as obvious
as they are the gags have an added
swing. Unsubtle, physical comedy—
even the gags are all directed at a
face or a condition of clothing—it
has stayed well away from reality,
emotional intensity, and pathos.
—Sandoe
AFRAID TO TALK—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Exploiting to the utmost Lhc me
chanical capacity of the motion pic
ture to create tense emotion, the di
rector of this film, a Mr. Edward L.
Cahn, overlooked one factor indis
pensable to dramatic effect. So long
as the spectator is aware only of the
horror perceived, achievement of the
supremely blood-curdling is drama
tically feasible. When the perceiver
becomes conscious of his own emo
tional reactions then is the play, as
a play, worthless.
Adapted from the Maltz-Sklar
play, "Merry-Go-Round," the scen
ario was prepared by an erstwhile
political reporter, Tom Reed, The
play ,to be sure, borrowed not a
little of its dramatic quality from
that warehouse of drama, the under

world, but the picture has been
drawn from it indiscriminately.
In order to meet the Hollywood
illusion that *drama is a degree of
sensation the climaxes are indefati
gably exhausted. To force a confes
sion from an anemic youth, Eric;
Linden, a dozen city officials and
detectives intimidate and attack him.
The prolonged scene ensuing in
which we hear unpleasant sounds
from his cell supposedly covers
eleven hours. Obviously, this is
climax ad nauseam.
Gruesome atmosphere is increased
by the piquant acting of Sidney Fox,
young wife of the framed bellboy,
through the same directorial device,
exaggeration. It is the comparison
of her unreal ingenuousness with the
inhuman unreality of the politicians
that places the whole production
outside the realm of probability and
the digestive powers of the audience.

pensable to dramatic effect. So long
as the spectator is aware only of the
horror perceived, achievement of the
supremely blood-curdling is drama
tically feasible. When the perceiver
becomes conscious of his own emo
tional reactions then is the play, as
a play, worthless.
Adapted from the Maltz-Sklar
play, "Merry-Go-Round," the scen
ario was prepared by an erstwhile
political reporter, Tom Reed, The
play ,to be sure, borrowed not a
little of its dramatic quality from
that warehouse of drama, the under

world, but the picture has been
drawn from it indiscriminately.
In order to meet the Hollywood
illusion that *drama is a degree of
sensation the climaxes are indefati
gably exhausted. To force a confes
sion from an anemic youth, Eric;
Linden, a dozen city officials and
detectives intimidate and attack him.
The prolonged scene ensuing in
which we hear unpleasant sounds
from his cell supposedly covers
eleven hours. Obviously, this is
climax ad nauseam.
Gruesome atmosphere is increased
by the piquant acting of Sidney Fox,
young wife of the framed bellboy,
through the same directorial device,
exaggeration. It is the comparison
of her unreal ingenuousness with the
inhuman unreality of the politicians
that places the whole production
outside the realm of probability and
the digestive powers of the audience.

HOT PEPPER—(Fox)—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
"Hot Pepper" is an inelegant,
rough, rather well-sustained farce
with not too much hip-undulation
and posterior slapping as well as
disrobing to be an amusing film.
Its vulgarity is frank and abrupt
rather than sly; it never masquer
ades as art or drama (see ''Call Her
Savage"); it is rowdy to an un
precedented degree without the
slinging of a single custard.
I should not care to advise it for
the serious and sedate; the roughs
find the broad double entendre
funny indeed. And with the figure
of the female in the cast as obvious
as they are the gags have an added
swing. Unsubtle, physical comedy—
even the gags are all directed at a
face or a condition of clothing—it
has stayed well away from reality,
emotional intensity, and pathos.

AFRAID TO TALK—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Exploiting to the utmost Lhc me
chanical capacity of the motion pic
ture to create tense emotion, the di
rector of this film, a Mr. Edward L.
Cahn, overlooked one factor indis
pensable to dramatic effect. So long
as the spectator is aware only of the
horror perceived, achievement of the
supremely blood-curdling is drama
tically feasible. When the perceiver
becomes conscious of his own emo
tional reactions then is the play, as
a play, worthless.
