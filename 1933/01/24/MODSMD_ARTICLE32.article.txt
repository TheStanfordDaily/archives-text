The Editor, Sir:
Friday morning the readers of this
column were treated to a brilliant
and scintillating letter by Carlos
Odriozola the subject of which was,
"Look How Intelligent I Am."
The letter is worthy of attention
only because it reflects the attitude
of a good many of Stanford's self
appointed intelligentsia. These peo
ple of feeble intellect and sturdy
tongue are always quick to point out
alleged unreasonableness in the
Daily. Honest criticism is welcomed, j
but childish objections become a nui
sance. These intellectual foul balls
are too attached to their own opin
ions.
The highbrows' dismissal of what >
doesn't come into their scheme of
life is like the oldtime Chinaman's -
contempt for women with uncrippled
feet. The bleating of this type of
critic is becoming tiresome. A cow
makes the same sort of noise, and
gives milk besides.
The unconstructive criticizers of
the Daily usually have an economy
of ideas themselves, and are able
! only to complain, not suggest some
! thing better. "The .stupidest man in
town may point out the road to the
school."
The latest outburst of a candidate
for the intellectual championship, in
the lightweight class, was due to an

article in the Daily in which various
campus leaders were asked what
two books they would take to a
desert island. Obviously, this was
just a method ol' brightening up an
article on the favorite books of
Stanfordites. However, the critic
considered this a good opportunity
to say that campus journalism is
stupid, and from his superior plane
pointed out that books are useless
on a desert isle because of the hu
midity, that sotne of the books
chosen would not be useful on a
desert island, and other absurdities
of a similar nature which were hard
ly perplexing enough to make the
Daily staff resign, muttering curses.
All these suggestions remind one of
the various methods detailed in me
dieval books under the heading,
"How to Catch and Tame a Uni
corn."
Mr. Odriozola took the desert
island far too seriously. Wc hope
he won't go around exploding the
myth of a Santa Claus and explain
ing that "Alice in Wonderland"
couldn't really happen, because of
the humidity.
We wonder how-and-why—Mr.
Odriozola left the desert islands he
mentions in his yetter. "I have spent
some lovely hours on a couple of
desert, islands in the Caribbean Sea,"
he says. Mental deserts, Mr. Odrio
zola? —Andrew Harris
