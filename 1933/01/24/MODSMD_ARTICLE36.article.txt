## YEARLING CAGERS MEET STOCKTON, LOWELL THIS WEEK Stockton Five Will Give Freshmen Stiff Test Saturday 
### Albert Guerard 
Can they stand the pace?
After bewildering 7,000 California
Gymnasium fans with their speed
and .shooting in defeating the Bear
Cubs 40-30, Stanford's freshman
basketball mentor, Jimmy Bradshaw,
is worried only by the tantalizing
question:
Will the Papooses live up to the
shining example set by themselves
in whipping : hots into the California
basket from all angles and outspeed
ing their Berkeley rivals throughout
the second half?
Mannion, Harnett Help
Ralph Mannion, forward, and Ad
die Burnett, guard, the leading lu
minaries of Saturday's contest, are
already being touted as possible
first-stringers for John Bonn's var
sity hoop team. Mannion is blessed
with the same uncanny shooting eye
that has helped Tom Cordry win
high scoring honors in most of the
important varsity games tjiis year.
But Mannion is not handicapped
by Cordry's short stature. He is no
giant, but is tall enough for a for
ward.
Burnett was the Indian high-point
man against California, scoring 13
points from his running guard posi
tion. He is built like Vance Fawcett,
one of the best players in Stanford
history, and more important, he has
the same style of play.
Lowell. Stockton
Next week-end's contests bring
Lowell and Stockton high schools to
the Farm. Lowell is expected to fur
nish some good competition, as their
five held California's frosh to a close
score, but Stockton . . .
Galileo swamped Stanford.
Stockton swamped Galileo, 52-29.
And both of these games were very
genuine inundations of basketballs
.swishing through Stanford's baskets. ■
Last year, however, Stockton came
here expecting to batter the 1932
frosh who had not yet won a single
game, while the Tigers had been
winning the valley title. Stanford
won, 22-21.
