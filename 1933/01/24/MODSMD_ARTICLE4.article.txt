# PHILOSOPHICAL TALK TONIGHT
## Dr. Schiller To Dwell On Disputed Theories 
### 
Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, leader in
British pragmatic philosophy circles,
speaking tonight at 7:30 o'clock, will
ask his Little Theatre audience,
"Must Philosophers Disagree?"
Schiller, who arrives at Stanford
this morning fresh from England,
has been teaching philosophy since
1893, when he was an instructor at
Cornell University. After three years
at Cornell, he sailed for England to
become a tutor at Corpus Christi
College. In this capacity Dr. Schiller
served for 29 years.
Educated at Rugby, Balliol College,
and at Oxford, Schiller has also been
made a Fellow of Corpus Christi
College. He is the author of books
and magazine articles, including
"Studies in Humanism," '"Eugenics
and Politics," "Problems of Belief,"
and "Riddles of the Sphinx."
Following this evening's talk, Dr.
Schiller will deliver the 1933 Howis
ton Lecture at the University of
California. He will then travel south
to become a visiting professor of
philosophy at the University of
Southern California.
