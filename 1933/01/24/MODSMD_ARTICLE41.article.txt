IT BEGINS TO LOOK as if Stanford would have quite some help for
Claude Thornhill next year, when that well-known pint-size commences
work on his first Indian varsity. Those who watched Ernie Nevers whip
his team into shape for its upset victory over the much-publicized Green
Bay Packers will testify to the fact that although they may have been
stars, they were no team when they arrived on the campus. Ernie drove
them for hours before he sent them against the three-times Nation;.l Pro
fessional Football League champions, but. their play bears witness to the
efficiency of Nevers' work.
<i <«!••;> *..« <§> <i;'i :♦->
THIS CLARK HINKLE, former Bucknell plunger, was just
about the sweetest fullback we have ever seen, but don't think that
Ernie is any setup himself. He and Hinkle cracked the opposing
lines with devastating effect, even though the yardage figures fail
to mention the fact. Nevers and Pinckert gave left-tackle Perry,
of the Packers, such a beating that he finally left the game, and the
270-pound Captain Cal Hubbard moved over from right tackle in
a hurry.
But what cracked the Packers, in our opinion, was the speed with
which Nevers ran his plays, and the unerring judgment which he showed
in picking weaknesses and hitting them before the Packers could figure
out where they were.

Every time the Packers tried to speed up their shift, at least one of
the black-jerseyed boys started to in the wrong direction. This
was especially true of that well-known. "Cantering Spook'' Harold "Red"
Grange (apologies, Mr. McDonald).
Captain Hubbard conceived the idea, late in the third quarter,
that if he should dash in fast he would be even more effective than
if he waited. So Ernie let him charge and ran the plays around
him, which resulted in yardage for the Stars and discomfiture for
Hubbard.
