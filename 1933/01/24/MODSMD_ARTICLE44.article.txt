# THORNTON WORKS WATER POLO TEAM HARD FOR OLYMPIC CLUB GAME HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Practice palenty is in store 'for
Stanford's varsity water pole; team
this week as it prepares for Satur
day's contest with the Olympic Club.
This game, which will be played
in Encina pools, will have a direct
bearing on the Northern California
Water Polo League championship,
as the Indians and the Clubmen

are conceded to be the two strong
est teams in the league. Should the
Club win Saturday, Stanford will be
at a distinct disadvantage in the re
turn game.
Coach Nox-t Thornton expects to
spend much of this week's practice
perfecting a defense against the
Club's fast-breaking defense.
