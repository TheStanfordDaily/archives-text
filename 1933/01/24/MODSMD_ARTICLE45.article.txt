# INDIAN LEATHER PUSHERS TRAINING FOR FARM BOUTS
## 
### 
With preliminary matches for the
All-University boxing tournament
scheduled to start early next week,
and the finals carded for February
2, Stanford's leather pushers have
settled down to their final week of
training before receiving their first
test.
A great series of fights is expected
to climax the tournament as i.t least
one champion is entered at every
weight. One of the best scraps is ex
pected when Waldo Munday and
Bob Quinn clash for welterweight
honors.
Munday who formerly fought for

the Olympic Club is junior Pacific
Coast titleholder but was recently
shaded in a close bout for the novice
championship by Quinn. Both fight
ers have been showing a lot of class
in recent workouts.
Several fast bouts are looked for
in the middleweight class with four
outstanding scrappers entered to
date. Jack Perego, 1931 novice
champ, and John Fowler, present
novice titleholder, are favored to
meet in the finals in the Pavilion a
week from Thursday, but Baer and
Ridley have both been coming fast
and may upset the favorites.
