# MALE HI-JINKS PROPOSAL GETS MEN'S SUPPORT
## Cameron Claims All-Male Show Would Satisfy, Make Money SUGGESTED BY DAILY Sandoe Proposes Coward’s Play, "Bitter Sweet" 
### 
While investigation goes on apace
concerning production costs of five
selections of the Theatre Fund Com
mittee for its spring musical pro
duction, Ihe proposal of a male Hi-
Jinks by the Daily received the
backing of campus leaders, and a
new possibility was uncovered yes
terday.
Many men prominent in campus
dramatics, including Jack Redhead,
president of Ham's Head and chair
man of the 1932 Junior Opera Com
mittee, would like to see an all men's
show presented. Don, Cameron,
Chappie editor, outlined the advan
tages of this plan.
Jinks Inexpensive
He said: "An all-male Hi-Jinks,
or something similar, would afford a
decided change, and should be a
big financial Success. An ordinary
musical comedy is expensive to pro
duce; the campus-evoked show
would be a great deal cheaper, and
would, in addition, satisfy campus
desires."
The new suggestion was "Bitter
Sweet," an Eastern musical comedy
hit of recent date. In a letter to the
committee, James SHiidoe, Sword
and Sandals member, presented the
merits of this show in these words: 1
"While I think that it would be far j
more valuable if the committee pro- I
duced something fine—a seldom- |
seen classic, e.g. Marlowe's "Faus- [
tus," Congreve's "Way of the World" j
—if the committee insists on musical j
entertainment, few better than Noel '
Coward's "Bitter Sweet" could be :
found. The show has never been
produced on the Coast, has a good
score, and a more substantial—if
sentimental—plot than most oper- j
ettas. It is worth an investigation." !
Musicomedy Favored
A recent musical comedy seems |
Ihe best choice to Stan Beaubaire, i
committee chairman. He said also j
that some data had been procured i
on "Pirates of Penzance," "Good
News," and "Girl Crazy"; as yet no i
information has been acquired con- j
corning "Green Grow the Lilacs" j
and "Hit the Deck," although com- ;
mittee members are attempting to j
ascertain the costs of these two pro- 1
ductions.
