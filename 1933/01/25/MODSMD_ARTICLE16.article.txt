# RUGBY RULES MAY MYSTIFY CHARITY FANS
## Game Makes Appearance Saturday For Benefit Of Needy Students 
### 
Be he rough or queener, does stag
it by his lonesome or goes with the
fairest of the fair, the Stanford man
that plans on attending Saturday's
charity rugby game had best brush
up on his scrums beforehand. Other
wise he may be sadly puzzled by the
antics of the Stanford Rugby Club
and the Barbarian All-Blacks at that
time.
For although the two ieams will
kick off much the same way as
regular American football, from then
on the game assumes an entirely
different aspect. When you see those
men line up over the ball with their
heads low and arms interlocked,
don't expect to see the latest varia
tion of Ihe squirrel-cage huddle. It's
only one of those pleasant little epi
sodes known as the scrum and of
which the keynote seems io be to
kick something, be it the ball, the
opponents' bare shins, or the referee.
You can't have a stranglehold or the
headlock, but almost everything else
seems to be legal.
Feet Important
Theoretically, all the damage must
be accomplished by the feet and the
idea is to kick the ball out to one of
the backs and let him start the goal
ward trek. These delightful little
gatherings compare to the jump at
center in basketball and they occur
whenever a man is tackled or when
the ball goes out of bounds.
Scoring is also quite different. If
you can tote the ball across the op
ponents' goal line, thereby getting
three points, you have an oppor
tunity to add two more points by
booting the ball over the uprights
by a drop or place-kick. The joker
is, they don't bring the ball out im
mediately before the posts, but the
kicker must do his stuff from u point
on a line from where the goal was
scored, no matter how difficult the
angle.
Rugby Fast
Rugby play is fast, wide open, and
continuous. Running, kicking, later
al, and backward passes are all em
ployed to advance the ball. Dribbling
is accomplished by kicking in short
spurts along the ground, and is
preferably done when the dribbler
has a bevy of huskies from his own
side surrounding him for protection.
