# Dr. Wrenn Study Section Hears About Note Taking
## 
### 
"Notes are no good in themselves,
but are only beneficial in aiding the
student to recall things, said Dr. C.
Gilbert Wrenn in his regular Tues
day evening Study Aid Group last,
night in Room 201.
Do more thinking in class than
writing, was Dr. Wrenn's advice for
taking down reading notes. In tak
ing notes, either outline or summary
in form, the student should "title
each group of notes," it was empha
sized .Both types of notes, Dr. Wrenn
continued, should be reviewed at
regular intervals, at. least once a
week.
Just, preceding the lecture, assign
ments of students to advisors for
special instruction and advice were
made. It was also suggested that
students take advantage of profes
sors' office hours to clear up special
points on class discussions.
