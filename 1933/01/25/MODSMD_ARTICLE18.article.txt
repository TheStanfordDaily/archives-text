# Holiday Rated Finest Of Philip Barry Productions
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
From the eight or more successful
plays by Philip Barry, premier
American playwright, Harold Hel
venston has chosen to present his
finest to the Stanford audience of
February 3: "Holiday," the hit of
the 1929-30 season.
While still at Yale, Barry won a
prize for his "You and I,"' one of
the outstanding of his earlier plays.
The experimental period of Barry's
writing saw the completion of a va
riety of plays with varying degrees J
of success.
"Paris Bound" marked a definite i
turning point to the type of play I
for which Barry is famous. It has a |
fine plot, dealing with marriage in a
straightforward manner and adorn
ing the story with brilliant dialogue, j
"Holiday," written for Hope Wil
liams, who had scored in "Paris

Bound," has just as distinct an un
derlying idea told with an even
greater brilliance. The characters are
fuller in content and wider in va
riety, and the lines they speak have
a certain "Mad Hatter" quality
which makes them occasionally elu
sive, but always delightful. The play
attains a rare fluency, without the
vulgarization of underscoring of
lines.
After "Holiday," Barry turned to
the more psychological, presenting
"Hotel Universe," a unique bit of
fantasy with a great deal of truth
behind it. "Tomorrow and Tomor
row" was another serious effort, a
play with many fine qualities. The
recent "Animal Kingdom" is more
nearly a return to the lightness of
"Holiday," but does not attain the
same gay charm of 1929 play.
