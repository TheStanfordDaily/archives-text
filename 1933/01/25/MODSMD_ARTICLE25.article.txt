# Roosevelt May Trade Debt For Favored Tariff
## Hope Seen For Defaulters In New Exchange 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (/P)—An
all-inclusive revision of the war
debts was forecast in Washington
tonight with the Roosevelt adminis
tration seeking in exchange tariff
concessions and trade agreements
intended to help America toward
prosperity.
This probability arose after the
disclosure that all nations which
paid their debt installments last
month would receive an affirmative
answer to their pleas for a renewed
study of their funding agreements.
Defaulters Given Hope
In addition there was a distinct
inclination to believe that those na
tions which defaulted in December—
France, Poland, Belgium, and Es
thorria—would receive similar treat
ment after the cases of the countries
not in arrears are settled.
Those who held this belief were
quick to point to Mr. Roosevelt's
view that the action of France and
other powers in declining to pay was
to be construed as a deferment
rather than a default.
More Nations Included
At any rate, Mr. Roosevelt will
receive representatives of Great
Britain soon after he takes office
and then will talk debts with Italy,
Czechoslovakia and Lithuania, all of
whom paid up last month. Prob
ably Latvia and Finland also will
be included.

That arrangements to negotiate
the debt problem are in progress
was made known today by Secretary
Stinison, in earrying out the agree
ment made with Mr. Roosevelt at
last week's White House conference.
