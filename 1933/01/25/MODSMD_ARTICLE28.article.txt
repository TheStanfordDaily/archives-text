# CORBUS RULES PYRE PETITION OUT OF ORDER
## No Provision For Big Game Pyre Made In By-laws Or Constitution VOTE IS IMPOSSIBLE Quad Office Move Blocked By Ex Committee 
### 
A petition by . r >4 students to coun
termand the action of the Ex Com
mittee on the bonfire failed in its
purpose last night when Bill Corbus,
A.S.S.U. president, declared it. to be
constitutionally null and void.
The petition was presented in the
belief that the bonfire abolition was
an amendment to the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution By-laws, in which case the
question would have reverted to the
student body in general election for
final decision.
The Constitution, however, ex
pressly grants exclusive control of
the bonfire construction to the Ex
Committee, which was acting within
its rights in abolishing the annual
blaze.
Heading the list of signers were
the names of Harlow Williams, '35,
Myron Birnbaum, '3(>, and Milton
Macowsky, '36, circulators of the
petition. The three appeared at the
A.S.S.U. office last, night while the
committee meeting was in progress.
Corbus, hearing in advance that they
were coming, called a closed meet
ing, and even if the petition had
been constitutionally correct Us suc
cess was problematical, since it must
be presented to the chairman in per
son, an impossibility at that time
because the chairman was in closed
meeting.
Ex Committee Notes
A move to have Iho Quad offices
changed from the Press to
the Union, proposed by Charles Karl,
student manager, was dropped on
account of the inconvenience it
would cause. •
Corbus, reporting on the activities
of the Student Relief Committee,
said that final plans will be com
pleted today and that an all-Univer
sity assembly is tentatively planned
for next week.
Mary Lyons was confirmed as jun
ior representative to .succeed Sally
Eeitveld. It was moved to donate a
permanent trophy to the Southern
California Debate Club, u prep
school organization.
