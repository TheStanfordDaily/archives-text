# THE 						UNION MEETS THE BOGEY
## 
### 
I >iM Business on the Farm met the local economic stress
squarely Monday with the announcement by the Stanford
I nion that all fifteen cent cigarettes will henceforth sell
for the popular price of two for a quarter. Welcome news,
that, Jo all men who smoke, to all women who smoke, and
to all men who lake out women who smoke. In short
welcome news.
II seems that the I nion, or at least the candy and to
hacco counter of the I nion, is beginning to realize its duties
as a monopoly. That is exactly the position which the
I nion occupies on this campus, one of a monopoly. Pro
treted from any competition of close proximity by the
I'niversity, the I nion lias the campus student population,
both consciously and unconsciously, entirely at its mercv.
Holding that position, the I'liion owes certain obligations
to those involuntarily faithful customers. Monday's re
duction of prices on cigarettes marks the I'nion's conscious
ness of those obligations and aj least a slight disposition to
meet them.
However, the prices of various other articles at the con
fection counter and the soda fountain remain at an ab
normally high level. Take bottled goods for example. Al
most without exception, the I nion price for bottled bever
ages is higher than the price demanded by Palo Alto
merchants.
If, operating as a local monopoly, the Stanford Union
cannot meet the price level existing in Palo Alto, then
something must be wrong with the I nion. It might be fiigh
i ( lit, or it might be mismanagement. The chances are that
I lie Inion can meet Palo Alto prices simply by doing it and
bv being content with a reduced profit. Hut that's the
t nion's problem.
The I'nion's duty, however, as a campus monopoly, is
to offer its commodities to ils customers at generally pre
vailing prices.
