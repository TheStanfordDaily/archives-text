# AND NOW A DEPRESSION COLLEGE
## 
### 
Word has just conic from the hills of Virginia that a
university will he founded in which the students will not
have to worry about financial matters. At least they won't
have to worry after they have paid $250 as a tuition fee
covering the whole scholastic year.
In this collegiate I'topi a, the professors will conduct
their classes in exchange for their hoard and room. If
reports are true in regard to "starving professors" the uni
versity will have many applicants for the teaching posi
tions.
Instead of dying for good old podunk on the gridiron,
the students of "Deflation College" will win their blocks by
clever deeds in hunting and fishing. Probably a minor
award will go to those who show proficiency in milking, or
an outstanding ability to discover where "them dern hens"
laid the eggs.
The vernacular of the student will have to be revised
in this new university. "Smoothy," "lounge lizard" and
other characterizations will have no models. The old fron
tier words will come hack such as "greenhorn" or "dude."
The students' ability to wander about the woods will be
considered more important than his navigability in a draw
ing room.
Scquoians should take heart. At this university the
"rough" will he reborn and his habitation will he a "Farm."
