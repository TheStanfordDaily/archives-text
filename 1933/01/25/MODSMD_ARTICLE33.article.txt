### 
II foil all afternoon, and wlion it got tirod of falling the
wind would just pick it up and drop it on the hods on
fraternity sleeping porches. Rain, or snow, or lightning, or
almost any climatic phenomenon, always brings with it
various human reactions. Yesterday's rain, rather yester
day's rain's reactions, were particularly interesting.
Ninetv-fivo per cent of us thought: "Jeez, what lousy
weather. Hut maybe now there'll he a Lake this spring."
The other live per cent, including any and all members
of the Five Hundred who mav remember the mud-sloshings
of the glamorous Swede: "Isn't it wonderful?" (This from
the warm dryness of a study room.)
The man waiting for a ride at the depot in Paly:
"shrdlu etaoin, ?* *!.... what snobs Stanford guys
are getting to be."
The farmer: "Say, this rain will just fix mo up fine."
(He never stops to realize that the rain will enable him to
glow large crops which he'll spend to harvest, and which
he'll never bo able to sell for a profit. Ho ought to pray
for a good drought year that would tix the country much
quicker."
