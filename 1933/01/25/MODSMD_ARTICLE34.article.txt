## MANOCHRACY

More machines to work for us,
more suits to wear, and more bread
j to eat is the alluring bait being hung
; out by the Technocrats. And, of
J course, during depression, nothing
| seems sweeter. We measure happi
j ness in terms of number of shirts in
(the dresser, number of cylinders un
' der the hood, and number of milk
! shakes under the belt.
Right now, everyone can use more
! of each. The very name, Techno
| cracy, spells more mechanical won
ders. That's why it has been able to
] spread over the country like apple
' sauce over a gullible professor. But,
I we probably need less machines—
I rather than more. The so-called
mechanical improvements of the age
have really enslaved people rather
than freed them.
I
To make enough coin to buy these
! labor-saving devices, the individual
| is required to work harder than he
j ever did. The only difference is that
I before he used to work because he
I had to work; now, he works because
: he has to buy labor-saving devices
and mechanical toys generally. What
J is the actual difference?
If once having caught our ma-
I chines, we could rest for a while
I and enjoy them, it wouldn't be so
I bad. But no, before our hetrodynes
| are worn out, we have super-lietro
i dynes. These have barely had time
, to collect dust, and the super-supers
I are out. Then screen-grid tubes.
Then tone control. All improvements
S but improvements which can only
be purchased with increased slavery.
Why buy them? How can one help

i nn/iL *
from buying them? Social compul
sion is the big stick. To keep an
obsolete radio in one's parlor is a
social sin akin to wearing Louis XIV
breeches on University Ave. Auto
mobiles will last, say, four years:
but what courage to keep a four
year-old in your garage! If you
haven't "floating-power and free
wheeling," you are classed as a hope
less barbarian—a rank outsider—a
deplorable reactionary.
Then too, the new things are im
provements and they are attractive.
A dog will stand on its hind legs for
a bone. A child will toddle across
the room for a stick of candy. And
men will work and worry like ma
niacs to get the new and best. That
is only natural. We get the new
things—the super-supers, the im
proved gadgets, the de this and
that. But we pay for them with a
wild swirl that is not only tiring but
very dizzyfying.
The modern home doesn't look
like a home. It looks like an ap
pliance display. From the basement
to the attic with a special stop-over
at the kitchen, all is mechanical; all
is change. I don't mind improve
ments and change. But I don't like
to work for them. And work we
must.
We have everything now but an
automatic rusher. If Pan Hellenic
will finance a trip to Schnectady I
will do my best to persuade General
Electric to lash their engineers into
producing some new gadget to take
the burden of rushing off the lead
ing left arm of sorority dancers.
