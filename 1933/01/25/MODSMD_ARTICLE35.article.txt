Reviewer's Note: The' Stanford Daily has been refused critical privi
leges by Mr. Thomas Earnfred of the Curran and Geary theatres on the
grounds that Daily comments upon their productions have not been suffi
ciently favorable.—Sandoe.

Press Agent, the Geary and Curran
Theatres
Dear Sir:
I idealize that the granting of the
courtesy of reviewers' seats should
logically continue only as long as'
both parties benefit by the transac
tion, and that you, feeling that
granting them to us was harmful to
your theatres, have a perfect right
to rescind the courtesy. Neverthe
less, I question the tact of granting
the seats, and withdrawing them
only when I had made the trip to
San Francisco to review the per
formance. Your reason was accord
ing to your usual policy; you de
mand unconditional praise, and the
careful estimation of a play upon its
merits is not enough. The fact that
wjjh only one exception this estima
tion has proved favox'able does not
alter this.
Nevertheless, your action Monday
night was unfortunate psychologi
cally. A reviewer who has been
promised seats only to have to pay
for his own and sit in a 'drafty gal
lery is not in an impartial mood; also
he cannot write as sound a criticism
when he sees only the actors' legs.
Still, maintaining my policy of criti
cal estimation, I found the play good
—somewhat to my disappointment,
in view of your attitude.
I realize that to you drama exists
only in terms of dollars and cents,
and you feel that (apart from any
good or harm it may do drama as an
art) anything short of exuberance
harms the box office. To prove to
you that the opposite is true is pos
sibly quite futile, and I can only re
peat old arguments. Reckless en
thusiasm over bad plays will natur
ally lead to a distrust of reviewers
and cause you to depend on word
of mouth publicity for your good
plays; for very few customers bother
to consult New York reviews before
hand to determine the quality of a
play. Finding no accurate "criterion,
many will and do stay away, and
few will be urged to come by habi
tual ebullience. The attempt of the
theatres to kill criticism would, if
successful, check any progress in
drama and create apathy in the in
telligent playgoer who has some
taste. And drama, forced to appeal
to the tasteless multitude, could not
stand the competition of the motion
picture. But such a crushing of
criticism does not go beyond the
daily papers, since you have not the
stranglehold of advertising by which
to bend other review publications to

accept your standard of superlatives.
Consequently you create apathy only
in that group reached by the news
papers alone.
And what would be gained by fos
tering this apathy in college stu
dents and teachers I cannot under
stand. For our reviews are regarded
as fairly accurate criteria, apart from
the fact that they announce your
programs. Stanford contributes a
fair amount to your box office, and
I cannot see why you are desirous
of diminishing this.
Nor has your policy to force re
viewers where you could not threat
en them by taking away advertising
worked in the past. About a year
ago you rescinded the privileges of
the "Fortnightly" (which, incident
ally, had standards more severe than
our own) but thought it wiser to
capitulate.
If the Stanford Daily is to func
tion any longer as your unpaid press
agent only two courses are open to
u£. We could adapt the plan of the
better San Francisco reviewers and
enthuse wildly, but suggest the true
state of affairs between ihe lines.
But unfortunately this takes space,
and I feel that wherever possible
honesty is preferable to hyprocisy.
Or, we might contribute to your box :
office and review from the gallery
(with the express notice that we are ■
doing without the customary cour
tesies): but this would cause many
late reviews—too late to benefit you
—and would cause us to miss some
plays altogether. In addition, it is a
very difficult task to remain free
from prejudice in such cases.
I might also call attention to the
fact that other San Francisco thea
tres have considered that sincere
praise is better than superlative '
platitude, and are thus benefitting
by any publicity that the running
of reviews may give them.
Yours sincerely,
Curt A. Zimansky, '33
