## HOW ABOUT IT?

Tht Editor, Sir:
In the face of this much-discussed
depression, it seems to me that the
most flagrant and utterly inexcus
able violation of a rapidly disappear
ing system of campus ethics is the
hiring of the Toyon* Dance Commit
tee of an off-campus, Union orches
tra for their dance on the 10th. Wi<h
at least two fairly reputable campus
orchestras crying for jobs—one of
which, incidentally (and, singularly
enough, this is the one that is, ap
parently, the least advertised of
these two) is an orchestra of really
astonishing merit and ability and
very possibly quite the equal ol
Bunny Berson's—it seems to me that

■
it would have been only the fair
lhing to do to patronize campus or
gai izations on this matter. How
about it, Milo Tally?
Yours truly,

May I use your column to express
the gratitude of the students in En
ema, the Union, Toyon, and Branner
to the comptroller's office, particu
larly to Mr. Trowbridge, for imme
diately acceding to our request to
extend the time of closing the inter
hall switchboard from 10 to 11
o'clock. We of the men's halls abe
truly grateful.
