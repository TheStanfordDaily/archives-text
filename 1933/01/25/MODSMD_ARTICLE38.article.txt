THE WEATHER MAY BE
great for those who can afford
to spend their time lolling in a
canoe, hut it is certainly raising
heck with those industrious hoys
who have ambitions along spring
sport lines.
The tennis courts are being rigged
with blinds, for the convenience of
local duck hunters. The golf course
is .so soft even the gophers are
ashamed to be caught digging. Our
champion mermen were rained out
of their pools last Saturday. Dink'.s
little boys are glowing fatter and
slower at a rapid rate, and Harry
Wolter's pet yard is furnishing stiff
competition for Lagunita.
SPEAKING OF THE VARSITY
base-ball team, reminds us that the
dyed-in-the-wool fans are due for
a big break when they turn cut to
see the Coast League teams in ac
lion Ibis year. The new two-bit rate
for the bleacher seats ought to re
vive interest in baseball if anything
will. The gents who are breaking
into the leagues now are :io worse
than I hey have been in the past, and
with the new ".youth" movement
that most of the magnates are spon
soring there should be plenty of
fresh talent for the peanut con
sumers.
" THE NEW CALIFORNIA PA
VILION, with its accompanying
accessories, is an improvement
of which the Bears can he justly
proud. The only thing that both
ered us was the location of a
room for visiting team members.
Our guide solved that one in a
hurry. "They forgot it," he of
fered, unhesitatingly.
Anyhow, in spite of its elegance,
and the need which it will undoubt
edly satisfy, we would like to see
the "powers that be" over there find
some money for Ky Ebright's crew.
He has probably brought more at
tention to the Berkeley institution
than all the rest of their teams put
together. In spite of its sojourn in
Washington, the football team didn't
do a fraction of the good that the
crow did by rowing down the Hud
son a couple of times.
Ky will find some way out of this,
though, and if he has to puncture
a windbag or two it won't hurt Cal.
