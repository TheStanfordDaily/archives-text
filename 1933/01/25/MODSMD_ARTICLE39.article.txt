# Walrus Club To Hear Technocracy Discussion
## 
### 
Technocracy—the "whys" and
"wherefores" of it—will be discussed
by Professor Theodore Kreps of the
Graduate School of Business in an
informal meeting of the Stanford
Walrus Club at 7:30 o'clock tomor
row evening on the second floor of
the Women's Clubhouse.
In an effort to probe beneath the
superficiality which has arisen
around the word "technocracy" since
its sudden overnight popularity, fac
ulty members representing the en
gineering, economics, and political
science departments will meet with
llie students and express their
opinions.
The meeting is open to both men
and women students and the fac
ulty. •
