# COACH BUNN GIVES SECOND STRING BASKET PLAYERS STIFF WORKOUT
## 
### 
Continuing the two-day mofa- '
torium for his basketball regulars,
Stanford Cage Coach John Bunn
drilled some of his less-famous f
squad members yesterday in a j
sweat - pouring, error - correcting
1 workout.
1 Most of the afternoon was spem
sending five men down the court in
offensive maneuvers against a pair
of panting guards. Bunn wanted the
boys to break for the basket faster,
to shoot more often when free, and
I to disregard mid-court guarding.
Keith Topping, who alone among
the regulars was allowed to dress '
and scrimmage, proved himself a
potent dribbler. Bunn apparently
believes that Topping's self-sacri
ficial tendencies (he seldom shoots
or dribbles in a game) should be
supplanted by more individual play,
| and the big brunette center proved
I yesterday that he sinks them when
: he does shoot them.

Bill Schnetka was being worked
at center so that when Bunn wishes
to remove John Hancock from the
I game, he will not be forced to take
j out an entire team. Hancock is a
center on defense and a guard on
defense, and Schnetka is learning
similar duties. Chuck Glasgow is
learning a guard's defensive duties
for the same reason, as Carrel
Weaver (for whom Glasgow substi
tutes) is a defensive guard and an
offensive forward.
A1 Page and Palmer Fuller stood
out yesterday, and this pair ranks
' among the best of Bunn's up-and
coming forwards. Fred Schnabel
showed improvement in his shoot
ing, and Jack Norwood, Frank East
man, and Bob O'Connor worked
hard trying to stop an entire team.
Others who scrimmaged include:
Payne Palmer, Johnny Mack, George
Griffen, Tommy Lambert, and Gor
| don Daniels.
