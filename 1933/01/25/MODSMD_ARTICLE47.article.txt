# WINGED '0' TO PIT POWER VS. SPEED OF CARD MERMEN
## Clubmen's Long Experience Threat In Saturday's Water Polo Match 
### 
Experience and power versus
speed and stamina.
That will be the set-up next Sat
urday afternoon when Stanford's
varsity water polo team tangles with
the veteran Olympic Club septet in
Encina pools.
The Clubmen are all seasoned
players, including such players as
George Mitchell, Hugh Christenson,
Marshall Dnnn, Elmer Col let t, and
Arthur Austin, all of whom have
been playing water polo for at least
ten years.
Burns Captain
In addition they have Milton
(Whitey) Burns 1931 Stanford cap
tain, and Frank Pilling, former Cali
fornia star, who have both spent
plenty of time in the water.
Three of these men have been
members of American Olympic
teams and they are all tricky, last
breaking players.
Frosh Opener
Against this squad of veterans,
Coach Nort Thornton will pit his
more inexperienced, but speedy,
mermen. They also know how to
handle a water polo ball, and with
the added advantage of bemg in
their home pool, should provide an
interesting battle.
In order to avoid conflict with
Saturday's rugby game, a freshman

game with the Olympic Club juniors,
which will start at 3:30 o'clock, will
be played first. The varsity contest
should start about 4:15 o'clock.
