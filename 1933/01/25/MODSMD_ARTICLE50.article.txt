# TENNIS PRACTICE DISRUPTED AS COURTS FLOODED BY RAIN, BUT PROSPECTS GOOD
## 
### 
With the varsity tennis courts
practically flooded by rain, all ma
jor tennis practice and ladder
matches for the past week were dis
rupted. However, all the seeded men
are in good tennis shape, and Coach
Lockwood anticipates no trouble in
conditioning his men to sea3on form
when practice matches actually be
gin at the end of the quarter.
Surprising many tennis devotees
on the campus with his excellent
playing, Howard Blethen last week
arose one man higher on the squad
with a win over Dan Ellis. Of course,
as soon as Ellis returns to active
playing his game will no doubt im
prove rapidly. He will probably see
service in the conference matches
next quarter.

Tentative lineup of the doubles
teams at this time puts men together
with varied styles of game. By this
strategy Lockwood hopes to develop
three very effective doubles com
binations.
Captain Coughlin has paired up
thus far with Jack Cosgrove, a net
man with great potentialities, who is
eligible for play this year. Dan Ellis
and Chuck Otis comprise another of
the doubles teams, being veterans
of last year's play. The other com
bination is Glenn Reed and Sammy
Loo. Leo plays a bang-up game,
which, combined with Rood's all
around dependable playing and ex
cellent volleying, makes them dan
gerous at all times. These doubles
have played extensively the first two
weeks of the quarter.
