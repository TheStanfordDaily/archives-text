# Campus Drives, Walks Improved By New Gravel
## 
### 
Campus improvements in Ihe na
ture of better roads and improved
parking places near the libraiy are
some of the projects either planned
or actually started on the campus as
a result of the recent heavy rains.
Miserable condition of the huge
parking area which surrounds the
Library, because of ruts and the
winter rains, has already been reme
died by a coating of loose gravel. As
soon as present rains stop, thb will
be rolled firmly and top layer gravel
added.
When this is completed, Toyon
and Branner students who usually
cut aci'oss diagonally from the en
gineering corner to the halls, will
avoid being splattered by water from
the cars and will also find the foot
ing much firmer.
