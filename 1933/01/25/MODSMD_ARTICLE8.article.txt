### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (/P) â€”
Senate Democratic leaders served
notice today they would permit no
delay in consideration of the Col
lier-Blaine 3.05 per cent beer bill by
the Senate Finance Committee, in
which it now rests after being ap
proved by the judiciary committee.
Senator Harrison, ranking Demo
cratic member of the Finance Com
mittee, said he had asked Chairman
Smoot soon to call a meeting to con
sider the revenue angles of the bill.
"If there is a disposition not to con
sider it reasonably early there will
be a motion to discharge the com
mittee," Harrison said.
