# BATTERED FIVES LOOK FORWARD TO FIRST WINS
## U.C.L.A. Bruins Famous for Second Half Letdown; Cards Favored WILL PIPER GO WILD? Stanford Also Plays Better During First Half 
### 
Favorites in the Battle of the Cel- ,
lar tomorrow night with the U.C.L.A. j
Bruins, Stanford's basketball team 1
'
hopes to emerge from subterranean j
depths to the light of victory. For
both the Bruins and the Indians !
have yet to win a Conference vie- |
tory, and, since there is a current |
ruling to the effect that one of the j
two competing teams must win in a j
basketball game, either U.C.L.A. or
Stanford must break their perfect j
record.
Good Against U.S.C.
Stanford is favored because of ■
their brilliant showing against U.S.C.
and because the Cards were off form
against California. Comparative |
scores leave the game a toss-up, as i
California trounced Stanford but
had trouble with the Bruins, while j
Southern California did just the re
verse, finding Stanford the hardest J
of the two teams to beat.
To date, Stanford has boasted a
championship first-half basketball
team: a team that outscored its op- j
ponents during the first twenty min- j
utes but has been apparently unable !
to learn that a basketball game lasts j
forty minutes and not twenty. In
order to remedy this sad state of j
affairs, Coach Bunn has been drill- i
ing the boys on mathematics during j
the weeks and has also allowed most |
of his regulars a long rest in which j
to build up stamina and tear down i
staleness.
Start Fast
U.C.L.A. has also shown to ad- !
vantage during the start of its j
games, so that tomorrow's first halt j
at least promises to be brilliant. Like j j
most Bruin teams, this year's seems
unable to last a full game and Stan- j
ford's favoritism is due at least par- !
tially to the superior condition of
the Bunn basketeers.
As a matter of newsy interest, to- j
morrow's game brings together the j
two strongest cellar teams in Pacific ]
Coast Conference history. Both the |
Cards and the Bruins are infinitely |
improved over last year, and neither j
admits that it is out of the running
for the Southern division champion- '
ship. Although lineups are un
announced, they promise to feature j
Cordry, Topping, Hancock, Piper, |
and Brotelmarkle of all-Conference
calibre.
