# Door-Step Waif Left At D.G.'s
## 
### 
Picture the sisters curled lip on
the divan in front of the fire with
their fudge and popcorn balls at
one a.m., with the drip-drip of the
rain outside—
Suddenly a tremendous peal
on the doorbell sends them scur
rying to the door—Mary with a
flat tire! Dottie with a drunk!
But no, nothing so commonplace;
instead, a mattress-enshrouded lump
of manhood bellowing through rope
tied mouth for help. So the most
dressed of the sisterhood hied her
self to the pantry for a knife, with
which the ropes were cut. Cowered
behind the door the rest of the
house, expectant and fearful of what
the mattress hid.
Eureka. Voila, and my sakes
alive, a Kappa Sig Pledge, who
fled, clutching his mattress,
across the D.G. lawn to the
shades of Encina!
