### SILVIA ANN COWELL 
"Why doesn't dearest write home?"
That is the question that continu
ally pops up in the mail received
at the Dean of Men's office. Accord
ing to Miss Church, the secretary,
letters arrive from anxious parents
and relatives of students who haven't
heard from their progeny for weeks.
The other day a telegram arrived
from a frantic grandma who had not
received a letter for two months.
Another, from somebody's grand
aunt, living in New Rochelle, New
York, demanded Ihat the negligent
student send an air-mail special de
livery letter immediately.
The uncommunicative student is
"hunted out" by the dean's office
and goaded into writing a consola-

Tory epistle to the irate relatives.
The mother of a student from San
Francisco telephoned frantically to
the dean's office to find out if her
son had been drowned. A city news
paper had reported that his body
was being hunted in the bay. In
vestigation at Stanford showed that
the victim was another boy.
Once or twice during the history
of Stanford, students have not been
found. About four years ago an un
employed undergraduate vanished
and has never been heard of since.
Another instance smacking of the
Powers of is that of a
graduate student who walked out
mysteriously, one day, never to re
turn.
