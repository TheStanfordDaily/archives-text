# Prosh Battle To Re-Kindle Dying Pyre
## 
### 
Fighting for Ihe dying embers of
the Stanford Bonfire, a handful of
freshmen today reaffirmed their de
j termination to put the question to
the student body for a decisive vote
; to settle whether the bonfire shall
i pass, or remain.
Left unsatisfied by the Ex Com
mittee's blow to their plans Tues
day night, when a petition signed by
54 students was proven unconstitu
tional, Harlow Williams, '35, Myron
Birnbaum, '3G, and Milton Macow
| sky, '36, circulators of the original
I petition, planned to go forward to
day toward a goal of 150 names.
Petition Acceptable
Bill Corbus, A.S.S.U. president, de
| clared last night that he would ac
j cept a petition of 150 names, and
according to Constitutional provision,
put the bonfire's extinction to a gen
eral vote at the February elections.
"Thumbs-up" by a two-thirds ma
i jority may retouch a match to what
looks like a pile of already drab
i ashes; but this is not a strong prob
| ability, Corbus intimates.
"The saner campus feeling has
j been against the bonfire," Corbus
| said. "And the unconservatives
j failed to come through when the
j work demanded. I shall be glad to
| put the question to a student vote,
j but according fo present feeling, I
| think the bonfire will be voted down
| completely."
I One dissenting opinion arose last
| night:
i Aylett Cotton, last year's frosh
| president: "The friendships made
; during bonfire const ruction more
| than make up for the trouble and
j cost."
Favoring Corbus Move
Others agreed with Corbus:
Dean Kendall, freshman class
j president: "If Bill Corbus feels it
' should be done away with, I don't
1 think the class will be very disap
| pointed."
Dan Ellis, '34, assistant yell-lead-
I er: "The bonfire idea has grown too
j common. I think it will be voted
j down."
j "Ax" Nyland, '33, member inter
! fraternity board: "It's bound to be
| abolished."
