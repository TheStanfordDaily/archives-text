WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (A 3 ) â€” |
! Stamped with the final approval of j
j House and Senate, a bill carrying i
! $90,000,000 in Federal credit for the |
J farmer was dispatched tonight to the j
i White House. Sponsors of the legis- ,
lation predicted President Hoover

Hailed as providing the only ade- j
quale source of credit for thousands j
of purse-pinched farmers, the bill
( would authorize the Secretary of
! Agriculture to lend $00,000,000 for
use in producing 1933 crops. As se
j curity, the government would take j
I a first lien on the crop.
