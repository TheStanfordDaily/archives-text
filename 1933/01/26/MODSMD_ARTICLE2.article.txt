WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (JP)â€”Help I
for the farmer, on a gigantic scale j
never before attempted, was pro- |
posed in Congress today in legis- ;
lative form with the backing of the j
powerful Democratic leadership and
organized agriculture.
Calling for Federal outlays run- '
ning far above a billion and one
half, the huge program was de- j
signed to provide the farmers with
ready cash, postpone their mort
gage payments and lower their in- !
terest rates. Senator Robinson of |
Arkansas, Democratic leader, intro- '
duced the bill.
