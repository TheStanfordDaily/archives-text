# "HOLIDAY" SETS SHOW CONTRAST
## Fifth Avenue Interiors Are Designed By Stover 
### 
The February third production of
| "Holiday" in the Assembly Hall will
j be featured by two of the most at
i tractive sets Frederick Stover has
! designed, work on which is already
v/ell under way.
Unlike "Death Takes A Holiday,"
| which had but a single setting, the
S Philip Barry play requires two dif
j ferent sets, with a definite contrast
| between the two.
The action of the first and third
' acts takes place in the second floor
, living-room of the Seton family's
j five-story home on Fifth Avenue,
I New York. The room, typical of the
! financial genius of the father, Ed
l ward Seton, is distinguished by an
i austere simplicity. Stover's set will
j emphasize the severity of this high-
I ceilinged, rich room by a simplicity
: of design, concentrated in the heavi
! noss of the furnishings. The coloring
j of this Stanford White-period room
! will be a cold steel blue.
: The delightfully mad action of
I Act II takes place in the eld play
! room on the top floor of the mansion
â€”a room in direct contrast to the
: rest of the house. It is the special
! property of Linda, heroine of Barry's
play, and will be done in gay sky
i blue. In the background are seen
j two trapezes from which Linda and
i her impossible Cousin Seton Cram
i used to swing by their knees and
! spit at each other.
