# FOR STUDENT RELIEF
## 
### 
A surest ion has come from Ike Livermore, President
of llie Intcrfraternity Board, llial each eating group should
reduce one of ils meals to n simple fare and subtract the
cost of I his menu from the estimated cost of a regular
dinner. The difference would go to the Student Relief
Fund.
After consulting house managers, it was revealed that
about six dollars could be saved by each eating group.
Multiplying this sum by .'Jf> the substantial total of $210
results.
The very simplicity of the plan is one of the major
factors in ils favor. Certainly no one would object to eating
a meal consisting of soup, beans, bread, and apples, for
instance, once during the quarter. By eliminating meat,
vegetables, and milk a great saving is made. If this "fast
day" were inaugurated once each quarter a total of $000
dollars, one-third of the total received by the Student Relief
Fund Inst i/enr, would be contributed for the use of needy
students.
The Relief Committee should have no trouble organiz
ing this movement. The co-operation of the individual
managers of the eating groups is all that is required.
By foregoing that ,Wednesday steak dinner, you will
contribute to such items as these: "advance for room rent";
"services at Home"; "loans"; "food for ." These are
only a few of the many requests from last year.
That steak doesn't digest so well when the condition
existing behind the stark necessity of that phrase "food for
is fully realized. There were over ten cases last year
whose only desire was food .
