(ireat as the demand has been throughout the campus
that litis column print the remainder of the women's rush
ing rules, that pleasure will have to he lorcsaken. After all
this space is only two columns wide and about fifteen inches
in length, and the Daily appears only five days a week.
Then, too, i! is not intended to he a humor column.
The only laughs, however, are not in the rules them
selves. Take a look at the body which forms those rules,
<>i rather the body that votes on them after they have been
formed by someone else Panhellenic.
The "girls" all admit that the past rushing season was
;i hectic mess, yet Panhellenic, the only group through
which the rules can he improved, sils around talking about
how many times a week the pledges may eat with their
new sisters.
Now, when ideas on the plan are hot, when pitfalls are
freshest in memory, they refuse to do their revising. They
are going to do il next spring, after everything has blown
over and the almost-forgotten rushing season won't seem
so bad, after all. The most ridiculous part of it is that next
spring half the women on Panhcllenic will be nriv members
who have never sal on that committee through a rushing
fiasco.
Hut hell, there is no percentage in trying to get the
women to do anything. And perhaps il would not be so
good if they did come to life and decide to junk nine-tenths
of their asinine rules.
The campus would lose one of the best burlesque shows
m the world today.
