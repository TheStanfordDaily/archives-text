# FUEL FOR THE DEAD BONFIRE

Xow IliDaily Californian's "C.aliforniac" column lias
taken up Ihc cause of the doomed Stanford Big Game bon
fire. A little tardily perhaps, hut the C.aliforniac still wants
to give the impression that Berkeley men are all for old
rough-and-tumble tradition.
Says the Bear columnist, "It seems incredible that Stan
ford undergraduate spirit has disappeared so quickly . . . .
The C.aliforniac will never forget that wild ride to Palo
Alto the night the Ax was stolen .... and although the Ax
was never threatened, plenty else was, including Palo Alto
cops, street lights, road signs, co-e well, anyway, plenty
was threatened. . .'. . There lingers a distinct memory of
hand-to-hand encounters with big Stanford sopho
mores . . .
Of course the wliolc thing was, Mr. C.aliforniac, that
Stanford had grown weary of those frequent and reckless
Hear invasions. It had become dangerous to life and limb,
building the bonfire and guarding it, with those hordes of
wild Californians always running around the Farm that
was the whole trouble, too much "spirit."
In all honesty it must be admitted, however, that the
same "spirit" has waned somewhat down here at Stanford.
Stanford men are no longer interested in dead traditions.
Thev would no longer, for example, retain an annual spring
"Ax Hallv" with onlv the niemorv of an axe for a svmbol.
