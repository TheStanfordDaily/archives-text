# BULL SESSION
## IT'S THE THING 
### 
He screeched and suddenly
stopped. I jammed on my brakes;
and there nestled under my right
fender was an Austin. That wasn't
very novel; but on the Austin was
a sign, '"Repeal the Ten Command
ments." Before I could find out the
significance of the sign, the little
mechanized squirrel was off through
the traffic.
Maybe it's a good idea. Perhaps
it would be a fine thing—while abo
lition and repeal are in the air—to
repeal the Ten Commandments and
supply some others in their place.
After all, they are very old—lack
modern punch—and have collected a
lot of dust through the ages.
They have outjived their purpose
largely. Some of them have become
dead-letters and the others have
long been accepted as the right thing
to do. We don't need to be told not
to kill because we usually don't kill,
any more. Of coarse, except when
we have a war, and then we find
some reason to evade the letter of
the old law.
Good people have long since looked
upon robbery, per se, as improper
conduct. Some types of indirect
money-or-your-life stuff goes on,
but everyone admits that it is wrong
and blames "the system." There are
no more Indians to rob—and after
all, that wasn't really robbing. The
poor Redskins didn't know the value
of things. And America had its des
tiny to think of . . .
Coveting of neighbor's goods or
anyone's else is always frowned

upon—except that keeping up with
the Ebenezer Jones is an admitted
necessity. Then, there is such a thing
as ambition. If the neighbor was a
VB, not even a bell-ringer would
say that to attempt to get not only
a V 8 but a Vl2, perhaps, was not
justifiable American forward spirit.
That surely isn't coveting as Moses
meant it.
The Commandment about the Sab
bath is just one of those things—
O.K. for old-timers, but just out of
date. First of all, it's been moved
from Saturday to Sunday, which
sort of lessened its esoteric hold on
the imagination. Then, God SURELY
wants us to be happy, and when else
can one DO anything? And so, at
best, we compromise with the Lord's
Law and spend two hours within
church; and the rest of the day we
1 spend as we may.
Taking the Lord's name in vain
has long since ceased to have sig
nificance. The most delicate debu
tantes break forth with a "My God"
—in the most irreverent manner at
the most surprising times. They do
not use the term as a sign of divine
address at all.
And so, maybe the Austin was
right. Some of the Ten Command
ments have done their work; they
are accepted as right. We should
strike them out; and move to insert
others in their place. Many worth
while ones could be discovered. The
rest are like the 18th Amendment—
on the books, but ignored. They
bring general disrespect to all.
