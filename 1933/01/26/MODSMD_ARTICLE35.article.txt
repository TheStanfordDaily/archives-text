The Editor, Sir:
Now that Spcncer Nelson, '33, has
the depression bogey at our front
door in Toyon Court with his cry
of "buy at home," I feel, on behalf
of the committee and Toyon Club
members, that I should reply to his
communication to your Campus
Opinion yesterday.
There are several points to be
mentioned here that were carefully
discussed by the committee in the
selection of an orchestra.
First, "Toyon Club has had the
reputation of sponsoring the finest
dances of any living group on the
campus. A most necessary require
ment for any large formal dance is
a good orchestra that will play the
kind of music the campus wishes
and play it well.
Second, the committee spent sev
eral weeks investigating and hear
ing orchestras. Mr. Burson has an
excellent band, in fact, the commit
tee believes his orchestra will be the
best one to have visited the campus
since Ted Fiorita was here last Sen
ior Ball. Mr. Burson played at the
Guerneville Grove this summer, and
has recently returned from cngage

. ments at the Montmarte in Holly
wood and the Miramar in Santa
Monica to the Bal Tabarin in San
Francisco where he substitutes for
Tom Gerun on Mondays and Tues
days. He was recommended by two
leading San Francisco hotel man
agers as one of the best bands in
San Francisco. Next fall Mr. Bur
son will add five more pieces to his
ten-piece band in preparation for a
position in one of the larger Eastern
hotels. The . difference between the
cost of Mr. Burson's band and the
I truly great campus orchestras was
> very little in comparison with the
i ability to give the campus the finest
in dance music. It was on this basis
that the committee made their se
i lection, Mr. Nelson.
Thirdly, in speaking of campus
ethics and union labor as opposed
to non-union labor, it might be well
if some of these campus orchestras
• would turn fn bids corresponding to
their worth rather than seeking
union prices or prices close to the
union rate when they do not belong
to the musicians' union.
Yours for the finest dance of the
year— Milo Tally
Chairman of Toyon Formal
