GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE (Vajda-
Bolton.—At the Alcazar Theatre.
This play falls below the level of
the Duffy productions which have
appeared since the first of last fall.
Built about a plot which is, in itself,
very scanty and—although this is
not necessarily a fault in farce—ob
vious from the start, it has not suf
ficient bounce or sparkle to enter
tain consistently.
That is not to say that there are
no amusing moments; but the play
neither amuses subtly—and subtlety
can hardly be expected in farce—nor
does it become hilarious. Whether it
has suffered in translation or was
unfunny originally, or whether its
comedy has dated with the produc
tion of newer comedies with similar
problems (Let Us Be Gay, Private

Lives, Bridal Wise) is difficult to
say.
Further, the Alcazar production is
not keyed to farce. Lilyan Tushman
finds it difficult to sustain her act
ing for an entire scene—used as she
is to the cinema methods of taking
short scenes. Her gestures are often
stiff and unvaried. In the second act,
however, she played more smoothly
than in the others, inserting some
nuances obviously her own, and it
is probable that, under a better di
rector, she could have been much
improved.
Jameson Thomas' best first act
?cene is a lawyer's harangue to a
jury composed of his wife and a
friend. He played it too seriously
and without sufficient bombast—al
though the lines indicated a great
deal of flourish. Lenita Lane, on the
contrary, in an almost straight role,

overplays, particularly on entrances
and exits; her vivacity is distressing.
Miss Tashman's spectacular gowns
deserve a note. The rest of the cast
is very well attired. —Sandoe
