PFTH-T-T-T-T-T-T!
(From S.F. Examiner)
Marguerite Colburn Apfelbeck,
who recently gave an organ recital
in the Civic Auditorium, demands
"immediate, satisfactory and public
retraction" of the "vicious assault"
directed at her by her fellow towns
man, Paul Beardsley White, who
found her pedalling "amateurish and
her registration unbalanced."
Lest the organist's New York critic
held been unjust, the opinion of some
of our San Francisco organists who
heard the recital was sought.
joint critique of Raymond White and
Mynard Jones follows:
Largo (New World Symphony)—
Dvorak: Recognized the theme of
Goin' Home. So did some of the
audience; they went.
Kdmmenoi Ostrow — Rubinstein:
Chimes—gobs of diapasons—Shades
of Russia! Theme almost recognized.
Lament—Guilniant: Business of
Guilmant turning over—grave and
all!
Chanson Triste — Tschaikowski:
New harmonies, new tempi, remin
iscent of Irving Berlin.
Second Rhapsody—Liszt: The dif
ficulties of this piece bothered the
artist not a bit; she disposed of them
by leaving them out and landing
with a crash on the next easy place.

WHAT A WHALE OF A -
DIFFERENCE IN SPUD
"NEW YORK — Spud, a whale
scarred by collision with a liner 14
years ago, has been sighted in New
York harbor, incoming ships re
ported. He visits the scene of his
accident yearly, skippers say."—S.F.
News.
Said Spud, giving tail a proud
swish,
To his grandchildren, "Dear
youngsters, this
Is the very same spot
In this watery lot
Where I fought to a draw a tin
fish."
