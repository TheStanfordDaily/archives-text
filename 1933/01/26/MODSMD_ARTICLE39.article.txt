WELL, WELL, WELL, it
seems that we arc not as infal
lible and straight-forward as we
thought we were. Last week-end
we had the pleasure of parking
beside the Daily Californian's
sports editor during the evening
basketball lesson.
While the boys warmed the floor
jefore teacher arrived, we answered
arious and sundry questions to
vhat we thought was the best of our
■ bility. And one of the things that
,ve let out was the fact that Bunn
•annot afford to let his boys get too
ough for fear of losing one of his
ive or six basketball players.
Our editor pal, being more or less
•redulous, waited and watched dur
ing the game, and now is unkind
nough to claim lhat even without
joaching, which he also seems to
ioubt, our boys are a very rough
irid ready set. of fellows.
All of which leaves us very sad
nd disturbed, for if our own kind
and ilk calls us on what he falla
ciously claims to be prevarication,
what must our trusting public think
when I hey read such heresy?
And to think that we must ex
plain the fine points of the game
to such an unreasonable and suspi
cious individual through two more
games.
WITII THE ANNUAL Univer
sity IJoxing Championships slated
for the Pavilion next Thursday
night, we can't figure out why
some of the boys are so reticent
about signing (heir ears away.
The first day of registration
brought out some fifteen hardy
souls who now crave to be re
inforced with about twice as
many more. Or at least if they
don't we are sure that they
should.
What with Keith Topping defi
nitely resigned to John Bunn's hoop
squad there is all kinds of room for
Iwo or three classes and eight or
nine unknowns to stand out without
hesitation. The best part of a boxing
tournament is when some little guy
upsets some big guy or something
and we should hate to see anything
but the best fighters in the finals.
How about putting your names on
the dotted line, youse guys?
