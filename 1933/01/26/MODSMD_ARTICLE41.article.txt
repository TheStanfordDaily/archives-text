### 
Coming as a final blow to the Cali
fornia campus, the executive com
mittee of the student body at Berke
ley banished their two "Squawk"
publications at their Tuesday ses
sion.
The two publications the men's
Razzberry and the women's Dill
Pickle, have been long identified
with campus life at California, com
ing out yearly, with protests against
practically everything connected
with the University.
