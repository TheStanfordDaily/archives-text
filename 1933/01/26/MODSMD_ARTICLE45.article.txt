# BILL CARR, WORLD'S CHAMPION 440 STAR. TO END TRACK CAREER AT END OF YEAR
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 25 '
Down through the stretch bursts a
black-headed vision of flying youth,
arms driving rhythmically, slender
legs eating up distance, spikes biting
fast and clean into the track.
The bellow of 100.000 throats I
crashes down from the sloping tiers
of the Olympic Stadium, engulfs the
flying figure, hurls it on to the finish
line. '
The vision fades, and Bill Carr,
fastest quarter-miler in history, j
shakes his head, and tries to concen- |

' trate again on the book in his hand,
the scholar deep in the problems
of 1933.
For William Carr of Pine Bluff,
Ark., student in the Wharton Busi
ness School of the University of
Pennsylvania, the new year marks
I the end of a glamorous racing trail.
He will run out the string of college
competition, and compete abroad
this summer. Then the spiked shoes
of the boy who sped through 400
meters of the Olympic final .in 46.2
I seconds will go up on the wall for
ever.
