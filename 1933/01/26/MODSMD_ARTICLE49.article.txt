LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 (PIP) â€”
California's recent rains brought a
serious problem to trackmen of the
University of California at Los An
geles. Water soaking into the ground
of the new University track caused
the north end to sink several feet
below its normal surface. Parking in
the campus mud is a hazardous
proposition which the accident com
mission attempted to minimize.
