# Pink Elephants On The Ceiling
## 
### 
Chappie, with its latest scientific
revelations, is out today! And what
revelations!
Having traveled zigzag around the
world in a leaking laughing-gas
filled balloon gathering material for
the scientific tome, the Old Boy and
his staff of humor scientists are au
thorities on their subjectsâ€”
Pink elephants, lavender alli
gators. green snakes, and birds
described as never before; the
art of chemistry in bathtubs; the
study of the six outstanding
Stanford specimens of males
with wonderful illustrations and
descriptions, arc the findings of
the gassed scientists.
The master scientist of the expe
dition, studying the greatest find,
the funny bug, is portrayed on the
flashy colored cover.
