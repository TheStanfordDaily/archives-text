# Lowell Set To Sink Freshmen In Prelim Tilt
## 
### Julius Jacobs 
Not quite as strong as Galileo, but
a very good prep team all the same,
Lowell High's quintet is determined
to upset the Stanford Freshmen in
the preliminary game to tomorrow
night's Varsity-U.C.L.A. conference
game.
Coach Benny Neff will pit an in
experienced but brilliant player,
Gock, against Rabbit Bradshaw's
Don Greenlee, the former Glendale
star who has as yet failed to live up
to his high school reputation. Green
lee controlled the tipoff against Cali
fornia a good part of the game last
Saturday, but his work under the
basket was not very good. Lowell's
Gock outjumped Harry Cordes' of
California even more often than did
Greenlee, but poor defensive work
cost the prep team a victory at the
hands of the Bear Cubs.
Lowell has the best prep guard in
San Francisco in Coomba, a veteran.
Aguilar and. Ashley are Lowell's
most consistent players. They are
both short and stocky but manage
to get the ball off the backboard a
good part of the time. Riegelhuth, a
forward who at least has a fine
name, will be another Lowell starter.
Bradshaw will probably start Man
nion and Viguie at forwards to flank
Greenlee, with Farber and Barnett
holding down the guard posts.
