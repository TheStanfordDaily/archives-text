# STANFORD WATER POLOISTS TO OPEN SEASON SATURDAY
## Only Practice Game Played With Alumni To Match Olympian Skill 
### 
When Stanford's varsity water
polo team clashes with the Olvmpic
Club in Encina pools Saturday, the
tradition of 15 years of competition
will be urging the players on to
greater efforts. These two teams have
held the championship of the bay
region between them during all that
lime.
Coach Nort Thornton is working
his proteges hard for this all-im
portant game, which may decide the
championship of the newly formed
Northern California Water Polo
League. However, "Beat Stanford"
has become the motto at .he Post
Street pool and the Indians will have
to give everything they have to win.
Both teams use a fast-breaking
offense. The Olympic Club has more
experience, but Stanford has a mar
gin on speed and condition. The
clubmen handle the ball better, but
the Indians have an edge in drib
bling.
Coach Thornton feels that if his
team beats the Club, it will be one
of the greatest septets in the coun
try, challenged on the Pacific Coast
only by Southern California. His
boys have been pointing for this
game since October 1.
The public is invited and there
will be no admission charge. The
varsity contest will not start until
about 4:15 o'clock, following a fresh
man game with the Olympic Club
juniors. Thus there will be no con
flict with Saturday's charity rugby
game.
