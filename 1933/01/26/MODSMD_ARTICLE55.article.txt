Remember Denver Wright, St. Louis manufacturer, who bought a
couple of circus lions for a big game hunt? If you do, you'l! remember
a sheriff slipped in with a sub-machine gun, shot the lions and ended
Wright's safari. Well here's Wright in his trophy room with the same
jungle cats â€”stuffed. The outcome of his previous adventure caused
no end of embarrassment, but he says he is going to buy a couple
more lions for another hunt. (Associated Press Photo)
