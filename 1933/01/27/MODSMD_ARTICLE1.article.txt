# ROTH TO TELL CAMPUS ABOUT STANFORD LORE
## A.S.S.U. Sponsors Assembly To Discuss Topics Of Campus Interest QUESTIONS PERENNIAL University Administration, History Explained 
### 
From the sixteen-year-old frosh
who just registered from Fort Bragg
to the graduate student who has
been studying here for eight years,
every man, woman, and child en
rolled in the University will have
an opportunity to learn WHAT'S
WHAT about Stanford at an All-
University assembly to be held at
10 o'clock Wednesday morning.
Almon E. Roth, '09, Comptroller
of the University, at the request of
A.S.S.U. officials, will speak for the
administration to answer as many
of the questions of student interest
as possible in the time allotted to
the assembly. Bill Corbus, Stanford's
Ail-American guard, student body
president, will introduce the speaker.
To Explain Administration
"Six years ago," stated Roth,
"a student assembly of this infor
mational type was held. Since then
a generation of college students has
come and gone and many of the
present day Stanfordites have had
no opportunity to learn about the
University's history or administra
tion. Because of the changing con
ditions of today, there are many new
questions arising which the adminis
tration cannot explain except in an
assembly like the one planned for
Wednesday."
How and to what extent does the
depression affect Stanford endow
ments and income? This question
has continually been asked recently,
but busy University officers and
faculty officials haven't time to ex
plain to each and everyone alike.
In the days when the population on
the Farm was comparatively sparse,
more contacts were possible between
students and officials. The Wednes
day student body meeting has been
arranged according to its A.S.S.U.
sponsors, to promote an exchange
of ideas between students and ad
ministration.
Housing Question Open
Roth in a recent conference
with junior college transfers on the
housing question found that these
students had many other questions
to ask. Many of these will oe in
cluded in the address which the
Comptroller will give Wednesday.
Some of the perennial questions
were answered in the assembly six
years ago. They will be explained
again by Roth.
Will it ever be possible to keep
Lagunita full the year round?
Would a concrete bottom be a solu
tion of this problem? Where does
the water come from? Where does
it go? Will canoeing ever be a
popular fall sport here?
Can you tell the extent of the
University Campus? Is it tax ex
empt? If so why? Which of the
campus streets are public roads?
What is being done about student
employment?
Of course not all of the questions
can be answered in a short as
sembly; but officials promise that
those of greatest student interest will
be brought up Wednesday.

Lagunita full the year round?
Would a concrete bottom be a solu
tion of this problem? Where does
the water come from? Where does
it go? Will canoeing ever be a
popular fall sport here?
Can you tell the extent of the
University Campus? Is it tax ex
empt? If so why? Which of the
campus streets are public roads?
What is being done about student
employment?
Of course not all of the questions
can be answered in a short as
sembly; but officials promise that
those of greatest student interest will
be brought up Wednesday.
From the sixteen-year-old frosh
who just registered from Fort Bragg
to the graduate student who has
been studying here for eight years,
every man, woman, and child en
rolled in the University will have
an opportunity to learn WHAT'S
WHAT about Stanford at an All-
University assembly to be held at
10 o'clock Wednesday morning.
Almon E. Roth, '09, Comptroller
of the University, at the request of
A.S.S.U. officials, will speak for the
administration to answer as many
of the questions of student interest
as possible in the time allotted to
the assembly. Bill Corbus, Stanford's
Ail-American guard, student body
president, will introduce the speaker.
To Explain Administration
"Six years ago," stated Roth,
"a student assembly of this infor
mational type was held. Since then
a generation of college students has
come and gone and many of the
present day Stanfordites have had
no opportunity to learn about the
University's history or administra
tion. Because of the changing con
ditions of today, there are many new
questions arising which the adminis
tration cannot explain except in an
assembly like the one planned for
Wednesday."
How and to what extent does the
depression affect Stanford endow
ments and income? This question
has continually been asked recently,
but busy University officers and
faculty officials haven't time to ex
plain to each and everyone alike.
In the days when the population on
the Farm was comparatively sparse,
more contacts were possible between
students and officials. The Wednes
day student body meeting has been
arranged according to its A.S.S.U.
sponsors, to promote an exchange
of ideas between students and ad
ministration.
Housing Question Open
Roth in a recent conference
with junior college transfers on the
housing question found that these
students had many other questions
to ask. Many of these will oe in
cluded in the address which the
Comptroller will give Wednesday.
Some of the perennial questions
were answered in the assembly six
years ago. They will be explained
again by Roth.
Will it ever be possible to keep
Lagunita full the year round?
Would a concrete bottom be a solu
tion of this problem? Where does
the water come from? Where does
it go? Will canoeing ever be a
popular fall sport here?
Can you tell the extent of the
