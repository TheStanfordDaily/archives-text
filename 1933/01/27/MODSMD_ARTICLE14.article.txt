Wadieh Shibley and George Var- |
gas won the opening trial of the ]
'second round of tournament moot I
court last night from Jean Blum and '
James Boccardo before Dean Marion j
R. Kirkwood of the School of Law. J
The winners, appellants from aj
trial court verdict granting an in- j
junction against piling of coal so i
near the respondent's boundary-line !
that coal dust was blown across, j
contended that there was no basis j
for the injunction against the al- I
leged nuisance.
Blum and Boccardo claimed ac- i
tion was present for both trespass
and nuisance. The court overruled
their claim of trespass, but admitted
that it was "worth arguing."

lost their tilt against Phillip Ray and
William Ray in the first freshman !
moot court trial to be held in three i
year's.
Ansel Williams, head of the moot j
court board, presided over the first- j
