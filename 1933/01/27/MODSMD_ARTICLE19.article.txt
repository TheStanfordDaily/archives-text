# Ram's Head To Support Fund
## 
### 
Jack Redhead, president of Ram's j
; Head, last night reported that the j
Men's Dramatic Society will co- !
operate with the Theatre Fund in |
their movement to bring a musical
comedy to the campus.
However, the club as a whole is i
actively advocating the staging of a ,
i male extravaganza, bringing back
| after an absence of eight years this
I almost forgotten burlesque which
I was formerly produced each year.
Until 1925 Ram's Head, originally
| the founders of the Theatre Fund,
I sponsored this Hi Jinks which was :
j the main attraction of spring 1
! quarter, and which came out as The
! Ram's Head Follies. It was discon-
I tinued after 1925, just as the Junior â– 
J Opera this quarter.
Redhead plans to speak to the ad- i
I ministration and campus leaders j
! prior to announcing any definite au
j tion toward the new idea.
