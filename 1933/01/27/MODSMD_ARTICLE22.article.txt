# Rugby Reappears On Campus With Saturday Game
## Card Crew Meets Barbarian All-Blacks in Feature of Student Relief Campaign; Dink Templeton To Announce Plays; Hables Manager 
### FRANCIS HAM6ILTON 
WHEN the Stanford rugby wrecking crew of fifteen good men and true
takes the field against the experienced Barbarian All-Blacks at 2:;»0
o'clock tomorrow in the Stanford Stadium, a lot of old-timers and some
of the not-so-old-timers will stand around and ruminate and allow that
a lot of water has gone under the bridge. For 'tis many, many moons since
rugby was a major sport in these parts, many moons since it was only a
minor sport, and even a good spell since it was just a pastime, indulged
<S> in by a few of the boys that were

hanging around of a Saturday after
noon.
Because a lew of these old-timers
and not-so-old-timers allow that
rugby is as good a sport as dignifies
the name, they have gone to work
with a deal of enthusiasm to promote
the game among the youngsters,
hoping that the youngsters will
greatly profit by a smattering
knowledge of the great sport. Nor
man Cleaveland, and Scotchy Camp
bell, and Phil Clarke, among them,
have done a worthy job. And "Dink
Templeton, who is not in the best ol
health now, and Harry Maloney,
who finds the youngsters are a little
rough for him, stand on the side and
lend their moral support via articu
late cries of "boot it!" and "fall on
it!" and inarticulate cries that mean
nothing at all.
Benefits Relief Fund
And because money is not so Hush
as it once was, and the Dean of
Men's office is crowded with fellows
applying for tuition notes, and regis
tration is dropping off because some
of the fellows need more than tui
tion notes, somebody thought that
here was an excellent chance to do
a good turn to all concerned.
On the one side there was a group
of earnest young men eager to clash
and maul with other young men; on
another side was a group of men
(and women, too) who were anxious
to watch the first young men clash
and maul; and finally there was an
other group of young men (and
maybe women, too) who needed a
little extra money to help the cause
along.
Templeton to Announce
Les Hables, who in addition to be
ing a sprinter of note, is likewise a
manager of ability, took things in
charge. With his committee of high
pressure sales aids, he hounded
everyone until they bought tickets.
The B.A.C. loosened up and donated
the public address system and
"Dink" Templeton donated his so
norous voice to go with the address
system; Harry Wolters called off a
scheduled ball game; while the water
poloists scheduled a game to follow
up the rugby; Phil Wylie who, in
cidentally is coach of both teams,
volunteered to referee the brawl;
and a lot of other people volun
teered to act as ushers. Now there
is only one thing to do—hope that
J. Pluvius will volunteer its good
will and call off the showers, he
cause if he doesn't a lot more people
are going out in the rain and get wet
Saturday. Curiosity is just as com
pelling as it ever was and a lot of
people are curious to see just whal
it is these ruggers have got.
