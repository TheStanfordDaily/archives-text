# Founding Grant Sets Limitation Of Famous '500'
## Wilbur Suggests Separate Women's College 
### Rolph Malloch 
The well-known "500" would be
the "1.200" or "1500" if the founders
of Stanford had foreseen how many
men would be enrolled here.
"The limitation of the number of
women students permitted in the
University to five hundred seems
rather unjust in view of the growth
of the University," Dr. J. P. Mitchell
said yesterday.
Limitation Not Anticipated
"The object of the rule was prob
ably to limit the women students
to fifty per cent or less of the stu
dent body. It is a shame that the ;
amendment was not worded to state
a certain per cent, say thirty or
forty, instead of a definite limit. As
the rule stands it seems unfair to
the women but it is a part of the
Founding Grant so it cannot be vio
lated."
That the administration is seri
| ou.sly interested in the problem of
j the unfair limitation of women is
! shown by the fact that as early as
i 1919 President Wilbur had suggested
I a separately endowed women's col
lege. In his annual report Dr. Wil
bur said, "Among the most import
ant present needs of the University
in order that it may continue to
occupy its high position in education
is a large separate endowment, of
two to five million dollars, for the
instruction of additional women stu
dents."
One of Three Traditions
Dr. Mitchell pointed out that the
limitation of women is one of the
; three Stanford institutions which
have lasted long enough to be called
traditions. The others are the Honor
j Code and "No Smoking on the
Quad." The Registrar added thai
Stanford is free from many binding
i traditions which might tend to hin
! der progress.
Dr. Mitchell said that "Stanford is
| exceedingly fortunate in being well
| endowed by many charitable insti
i tutions. It is considered as being
; very prosperous. As a matter of
! fact it is not, but it has succeeded in
| keeping out of bankruptcy, which is
' more than many other universities
have been able to do. Our income
! goes mostly to salaries for the fac
ulty, although we had a building
| spurt when we built Toyon Hall,
Branner, Roble, and the eating clubs
; back of Encina."
