# CULTURE'S TWELVE-HOUR WEEK
## 
### 
The other day a senior student expressed surprise when
he was ushered into the tastefully furnished Felton Room
of the Stanford Library. It was his first visit to this third
lloor sanctum of literary art. After three and a half years'
residence on the campus he was seeing the Felton Room
with its treasure of books for the first time. Doubtless
I'll ere are many others on the campus who are likewise
unaware of the room's existence.
Rut, if it's your first visit to the Felton Room, don't
wear cords or moleskins. That, typically, indicates Vesprit
<le ban (/ottf of the room.
The shame of the entire subject, however, is that the
Felton Room, offering as it does the greatest reading pleas
ures to be found anywhere in the University, is open only
twelve hours each week from two to four o'clock on every
flay but Saturday and Sunday, and from eight to ten
o'clock on Thursday evenings.
IVrhaps twelve hours each week is sufficient time to
satisfy the pleasures of the Felton Room's present patrons.
Rut the thought occurs that the room's scheduled hours do
not permit any students with laboratory science courses »*»
lake advantage of its cultural opportunities. The Felton
Room could serve many more students by opening its doors
regularly every evening.
