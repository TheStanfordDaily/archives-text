# Quiz to Consider Bookstore Staff In Open Meeting
## Lesley To Aid Questioning; Students May Attend 
### 
Personnel of the Stanford Book
store will be the first item to come
under the scrutiny of the investi
gating' committee which meets this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock in the Rally
Committee room in the Old Union.
As the Bookstore is run on a stu
dent co-operative basis, Abe Mel
linkoff, chairman of the committee,
has announced that the meeting to
day will be open to all students who
are interested in the probe.
Probe Methods Considered
Acting in conjunction with the
committee will be the Bookstore
manager, and Dr. E. P. Lesley, pres
ident of the Board of Directors.
At a closed meeting held last
Monday members of the committee
discussed with Dr. Lesley the best
methods of examining the condition
of the Bookstore in order to achieve
the best possible results for stu
dents and management alike.
Campus Interest Aroused
Agitation for an explanation of
apparently higher operating costs in
a period of low prices with no re
bates being paid to students was
initiated by Mellinkoff in his Daily
column, Bull Session. Campus opin
ion showed a general student inter
est, and when in response to an edi
torial in the Daily, Dr. Lesley ex
pressed hi 3 willingness to co-operate
in an investigation, Bill Corbus,
A.S.S.U. head, aided in organization
of the probe.
Acting under the chairmanship of
Mellinkoff, on the committee are
Stewart Crawford, editor of the
Daily, Charles Karl, student man
ager, and four men from the Gradu
ate School of Business: Lawrence
Hogue, H. G. Raaschou, Alfred Bar
stow, and William B. Walker.
