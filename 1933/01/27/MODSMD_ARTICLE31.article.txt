# PEANUTS IN THE PAVILION
## 
### 
Cjunpus denizens have their first chance to see John
Hnmi'.s hovs in Conference competition tonight and to
morrow night, when tlie surprise-in-thc-South Indians lake
on the I .C.L.A. liruins in a two-game tussle. The Recl
shirted lioopmen, in spite of their gloomy prc-season horo
scopes, have turned out to be a scrappy, threatening quin
lel, and the crowd one of these nights may have the pleas
ure of seeing them put over an unpredictcd Conference
victory.
In spite of all the criticism, both external and internal,
of Stanford's Pavilion sportsmanship, the crowds of stu
dents which gather at the basketball games are perhaps
the hest-natured galleries in attendance at any of the major
sports. Of course thev boo, and whistle, and gripe, but it's
all in fun, and none of the cat-callers take themselves half
so seriously as does the surprised, shocked, visitor.
So here's away to the Basketball Pavilion and a lot of
entertainment, liny your peanuts just inside the door
