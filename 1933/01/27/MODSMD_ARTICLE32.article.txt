# BULL SESSION
## TO RUG OR NOT TO RUGGER 
### 
Frankly, I don't know what lugby
| is. I once saw an English newsree!
j but I don't seem to remember
I whether they were playing cricket,
( tugby, or politics. I went to the dic
l tionary and rugby is defined as "a
I kind of football"—which doesn't help
J particularly. There are so many pe-
I culiar games being played nowa
days, that no one seems to know all
of them, few know any of them, .and
1 know practically none.
But ignorance is no bar to the
■enjoyment of sports. Chaparral has
been running bits on dumb co-eds
jat football games for years; and
I every now and then I even go to
> a baseball y game. So to the Stadium
, this Saturday and see the game that
! makes sedate Britishers shorten
! their long "A's" in excitement. Any
j thing that can make Englishmen act
! as they think all Americans act all
ihe time, must be potent.
Even the Campus sports-scribeS,
who are always making us ordinary
i mortals cringe in shame at our
I sports-ignorance, don't know much
about rugby. For once, they don't
know who is going to win. It is
possible to sit with them at the
game, and talk as much as we care
to without fear of possible contra
diction. We can advance all the
rugby theories we care to; they are
impotent for a reply. We can razz
(he coach; we can praise him; we
can say there is no coach. No one
knows why or why not. The local
experts have been expurgated.

That alone is enough reason for
seeing Saturday's game of rugby.
Then too, the fact that the cause is
worthy should be no bar. It used to
be that worthy causes were always
set down as non-compos-mentis as
far as enjoyment was concerned. A.s
soon as one thought "worthy," it
was always with regard to a dead
ening charity ball, with bitter spins
ters and sugary home-made candy,
etc.
But all things pass. Now some of
the best things are given for char
ily's sake—music, drama, sports. The
receipts from Saturday's game will
expand the contracting Relief Funds.
And no one knows when his bank
will fail. It may be that we are
helping ourselves by attending. II
you won't go through altruism, go
through self-protection. As long as
you shell out 25 cents for a ticket,
the Committee probably doesn't care
what you»do or why you do it. You
can eat the ticket; it isn't half the
size of a cit seat card and is every
bit as tasty and nourishing.
The off-campus experts choke for
lack of long words in attempting to
describe the glories of this game.
It's rougher than football, faster than
track, more intricate than basket
ball, more gruelling than water polo,
more accurate than baseball is sup
i posed to be—and it sells for 25 cents.
We will probably have to vote on
rugby some day; we do on every
thing else. We should go for that |
1 reason alone. —Abe Mellinkoff

The off-campus experts choke for
lack of long words in attempting to
describe the glories of this game.
It's rougher than football, faster than
track, more intricate than basket
ball, more gruelling than water polo,
more accurate than baseball is sup
i posed to be—and it sells for 25 cents.
We will probably have to vote on
rugby some day; we do on every
thing else. We should go for that |
1 reason alone. —Abe Mellinkoff
Frankly, I don't know what lugby
| is. I once saw an English newsree!
j but I don't seem to remember
I whether they were playing cricket,
( tugby, or politics. I went to the dic
l tionary and rugby is defined as "a
I kind of football"—which doesn't help
J particularly. There are so many pe-
I culiar games being played nowa
days, that no one seems to know all
of them, few know any of them, .and
1 know practically none.
But ignorance is no bar to the
■enjoyment of sports. Chaparral has
been running bits on dumb co-eds
jat football games for years; and
I every now and then I even go to
> a baseball y game. So to the Stadium
, this Saturday and see the game that
! makes sedate Britishers shorten
! their long "A's" in excitement. Any
j thing that can make Englishmen act
! as they think all Americans act all
ihe time, must be potent.
Even the Campus sports-scribeS,
who are always making us ordinary
i mortals cringe in shame at our
I sports-ignorance, don't know much
about rugby. For once, they don't
know who is going to win. It is
possible to sit with them at the
game, and talk as much as we care
to without fear of possible contra
diction. We can advance all the
rugby theories we care to; they are
impotent for a reply. We can razz
(he coach; we can praise him; we
can say there is no coach. No one
knows why or why not. The local
experts have been expurgated.

That alone is enough reason for
seeing Saturday's game of rugby.
Then too, the fact that the cause is
worthy should be no bar. It used to
be that worthy causes were always
set down as non-compos-mentis as
far as enjoyment was concerned. A.s
soon as one thought "worthy," it
was always with regard to a dead
ening charity ball, with bitter spins
ters and sugary home-made candy,
etc.
But all things pass. Now some of
the best things are given for char
ily's sake—music, drama, sports. The
receipts from Saturday's game will
expand the contracting Relief Funds.
And no one knows when his bank
will fail. It may be that we are
helping ourselves by attending. II
you won't go through altruism, go
through self-protection. As long as
you shell out 25 cents for a ticket,
the Committee probably doesn't care
what you»do or why you do it. You
can eat the ticket; it isn't half the
size of a cit seat card and is every
bit as tasty and nourishing.
