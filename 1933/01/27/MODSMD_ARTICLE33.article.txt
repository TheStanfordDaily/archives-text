NIGHT CLUB LADY—(Columbia) <
—At the Varsity Theatre.
i This picture is one of the better
presentations of screen mysteries '
that has appeared in recent months,
though it by no means approaches
perfection.
The crux of the plot does not be
come obvious until near the end,
but when revealed, it presents a .
highly fantastic, unlikely, and un- ,
real solution to the murder of a
night club lady.
Adolphe Menjou seems to have
definitely forsaken boudoir scenes
and has turned to the portrayal of
older man parts. However, as a sup
posedly gruff man-of-the-world po
lice commissioner, it is rather in- 1
congruous to have him periodically
revert to the suave gentleman
about-town.
Suspense elements arc introduced
just before the murder is commit
ted. They are fine for the first two
or three but the direction has intro
duced so many over such a pro
tracted period of time that they be
gin to approach burlesque.
Skeets Gallagher, although drunk
j again, provides good comedy. His
i gags just preceding and during the
scene building up to a murder cli
j max alleviate the seriousness of the
! situation. The quick shifting from
comedy to impending calamity and !
back again thus obtained is very
good.
In general, an entertaining film,
particularly since if you're shrewd,
you may be able to pick the culprit.

***TOM COAKLEY'S ORCHESTRA at

the St. Francis.
Ted Fio-Rita and his hoys are
taking a rest this week but the St.
Francis is not lacking in music. In
deed not. Tom Coakley and his
band, with our old friend, Griff Wil
liams, formerly of Anson Weeks'
orchestra, are keeping up (he "Fran
tic" whirl. These boys can play to
gether, which goes to prove, we
suppose, that practice makes per
fect. The practice came in on a Dol
lar Steamship Line tour and in an
engagement, at the Roosevelt Hotel
in Hollywood. Since then they have
been playing at the Athens Club in

Oakland.
You'll like their singers, too, a
suwellll tenor, a baritone, and a lit
tle blonde by the name of Virginia
Haig, whose vocal calibre is regis
tered in her eyes, not in her throat.
Fio-Rita will be back on the job
Tuesday night. —E.E.H.

come obvious until near the end,
but when revealed, it presents a .
highly fantastic, unlikely, and un- ,
real solution to the murder of a
night club lady.
Adolphe Menjou seems to have
definitely forsaken boudoir scenes
and has turned to the portrayal of
older man parts. However, as a sup
posedly gruff man-of-the-world po
lice commissioner, it is rather in- 1
congruous to have him periodically
revert to the suave gentleman
about-town.
Suspense elements arc introduced
just before the murder is commit
ted. They are fine for the first two
or three but the direction has intro
duced so many over such a pro
tracted period of time that they be
gin to approach burlesque.
Skeets Gallagher, although drunk
j again, provides good comedy. His
i gags just preceding and during the
scene building up to a murder cli
j max alleviate the seriousness of the
! situation. The quick shifting from
comedy to impending calamity and !
back again thus obtained is very
good.
In general, an entertaining film,
particularly since if you're shrewd,
you may be able to pick the culprit.

***TOM COAKLEY'S ORCHESTRA at

the St. Francis.
Ted Fio-Rita and his hoys are
taking a rest this week but the St.
Francis is not lacking in music. In
deed not. Tom Coakley and his
band, with our old friend, Griff Wil
liams, formerly of Anson Weeks'
orchestra, are keeping up (he "Fran
tic" whirl. These boys can play to
gether, which goes to prove, we
suppose, that practice makes per
fect. The practice came in on a Dol
lar Steamship Line tour and in an
engagement, at the Roosevelt Hotel
in Hollywood. Since then they have
been playing at the Athens Club in

Oakland.
You'll like their singers, too, a
suwellll tenor, a baritone, and a lit
tle blonde by the name of Virginia
Haig, whose vocal calibre is regis
tered in her eyes, not in her throat.
Fio-Rita will be back on the job
Tuesday night. —E.E.H.
