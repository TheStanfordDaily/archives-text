"The University of Wisconsin has
devised a machine to treat cows with
ultra-violet rays."—News item.
We j'et shall live to see the day
When we can swear with solemn
vow
That there before Us, munching

How comforting to know it's true
And that we're not completely
"Pow"
And that others see it, too—
A truly, mooly purple cow.
