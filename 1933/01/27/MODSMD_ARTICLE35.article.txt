# CAMPUS OPINION
## GILBERT AND SULLIVAN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Permit another voice from the past i
to speak feebly but earnestly into i
the judicious ears of the Theatre (
Fund Committee: play safe with
Gilbert and Sullivan!
I take this to be an unpleasant but i
evident truth: that the Junior Opera j
has died mainly of a box-office com- :
plaint, and it is highly desirable to j
replace it with something that will i
draw a crowd. In my humble, mel
lowed opinion, nothing has yet been j
suggested that can compete for a
moment in this respect with any one I
of the Savoy Operas. For, unless I
am deeply in error, the cult of Gil
bert and Sullivan is still something
to be reckoned with in the English ,
speaking and singing world. You J
will find decent and moneyed people i
coming the whole length of the
peninsula to attend (say) H.M.S. '
Pinafore who would not even turn j
a radio dial to hear selections from i
"Girl Crazy," "Good News," or "Hit I
the Deck." Observe that in this age ;
of economic dearth, when publishers j
tolerate nothing but sure things, J
Random House has just issued a new j
edition of Gilbert's complete works. I
I trust that by this time members I
of the Committee have somehow '
been apprised that the one Gilbert
and Sullivan selection they have on
their list is precisely that which is j
being presented early in March by '
the Palo Alto Community Players, j
As a matter of courtesy to our Palo
Alto brethren, the "Pirates of Pen- j
zance" is the one opera that is out j
of the question. Its place may be i
taken, as I have suggested, by Pina
fore, or by almost anything else ;
from the pens of the immortal col- ;
laborators.
An all-male Hi-Jinks impresses
me as quite a gamble, especially ;
since I'm not sure as to the ingredi- j
ents of a Hi-Jinks. But I somehow ;
fear that Chaparral wit, even should j
the Deans allow it full scope, will !
not carry us a dazzling distance !
above the old Junior Operas. Female
impersonation, customarily the piece
de resistance of male shows, meets
with official soft-pedal at Stanford.
As for the various other shows j
suggested, while they may contain ,
a song here and there which the \
more juvenile members of the audi- j
ence would like to get up and dance
to (if Phil Harris instead of the
Stanford Novelty Orchestra were
playing it); and while they may
quite probably give us another
chance to see-the famous Loos legs, j
I fear that any one of them is likely 1
to be a dud as compared with Pina- I
fore. Needless to say, I have con- 1
siderations of excellence as well as
financial wisdom strongly in mind. |

I trust that by this time members I
of the Committee have somehow '
been apprised that the one Gilbert
and Sullivan selection they have on
their list is precisely that which is j
being presented early in March by '
the Palo Alto Community Players, j
As a matter of courtesy to our Palo
Alto brethren, the "Pirates of Pen- j
zance" is the one opera that is out j
of the question. Its place may be i
taken, as I have suggested, by Pina
fore, or by almost anything else ;
from the pens of the immortal col- ;
laborators.
An all-male Hi-Jinks impresses
me as quite a gamble, especially ;
since I'm not sure as to the ingredi- j
ents of a Hi-Jinks. But I somehow ;
fear that Chaparral wit, even should j
the Deans allow it full scope, will !
not carry us a dazzling distance !
above the old Junior Operas. Female
impersonation, customarily the piece
de resistance of male shows, meets
with official soft-pedal at Stanford.
As for the various other shows j
suggested, while they may contain ,
a song here and there which the \
more juvenile members of the audi- j
ence would like to get up and dance
to (if Phil Harris instead of the
Stanford Novelty Orchestra were
playing it); and while they may
quite probably give us another
chance to see-the famous Loos legs, j
I fear that any one of them is likely 1
to be a dud as compared with Pina- I
fore. Needless to say, I have con- 1
siderations of excellence as well as
financial wisdom strongly in mind. |

The Editor, Sir:
Permit another voice from the past i
to speak feebly but earnestly into i
the judicious ears of the Theatre (
Fund Committee: play safe with
Gilbert and Sullivan!
I take this to be an unpleasant but i
evident truth: that the Junior Opera j
has died mainly of a box-office com- :
plaint, and it is highly desirable to j
replace it with something that will i
draw a crowd. In my humble, mel
lowed opinion, nothing has yet been j
suggested that can compete for a
moment in this respect with any one I
of the Savoy Operas. For, unless I
am deeply in error, the cult of Gil
bert and Sullivan is still something
to be reckoned with in the English ,
speaking and singing world. You J
will find decent and moneyed people i
coming the whole length of the
peninsula to attend (say) H.M.S. '
Pinafore who would not even turn j
a radio dial to hear selections from i
"Girl Crazy," "Good News," or "Hit I
the Deck." Observe that in this age ;
of economic dearth, when publishers j
tolerate nothing but sure things, J
Random House has just issued a new j
edition of Gilbert's complete works. I
