## MYSTERY SEPTET MAY PROVE BEST IN INDIAN HISTORY Post Street Swimmers Have Three Olympic Stars To Use In Game 
### Willard Bungay 
Are they champions, or are they
another good water polo team?
This question should be rather
conclusively settled tomorrow after
noon when Stanford's 1933 septet
meets the strong Olympic Club
squad in Encina Pools at 4:15 o'clock.
Heralded as one of the greatest
teams in Stanford history (which is
saying a great deal), tlu- Indian mer
men have to date come up to ex
pectations in every respect. They
conclusively trounced an all-star
alumni team and have displayed a
fine brand of polo in practice and in
the interclass meets.
Five Sophomores
However, ihey are woefully lack
ing in experience: five of the first
nine men are sophomores. They
have displayed speed and stamina,
but it is still to be proved that they
will stand up under heavy fire.
Captain Burke Knapp, last year's
all-Pacific Coast goal guard, will be
a big asset to the Indians. Should
he falter, Leo Cook, sensational
sophomore will take his place. Other
members of the starting lineup will
be: Ted Wiget, Jimmy Triolo and
Dick Hirsch, forwards; and Vlad
Taranik, Don Kinkead, and Gordy
Graves, guards.
Speed and Stamina v
These players should m' .p in
speed and stamina what mey lack
in ball-handling experience.
The Olympic Club will bring a
great array of players to the Farm.
Among them will be George Mit
chell, breaking guard on the United
States Olympic team in 1924, 1928.
He was Olympic captain in 1928.
Other former Olympic team players
on the Club squad are Elmer Collett,
goalie, who represented Uncle Sam
in 1924 (a former Stanford player),
and Arthur Austin, also on the 1924
team.
Other Post street players include
Milton Burns, 1931 Stanford captain,
Marshall Dunn, who has had twelve
years of experience, Frank Pilling,
former California star, and Hugh
Christensen, a tricky goal shooter.
