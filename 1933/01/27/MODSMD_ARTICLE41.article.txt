Good old rugger Ims already
gone over l>ig among Stanford
students, though not more than
the "upper tenth of one per
cent" have actually witnessed an
official game. A good portion of
the ticket quota has been dis
posed of.
Rugby is a fast game, like basket
ball and ice hockey—its action sel
dom dulls. One thing it lacks, the
one thing that has kept the game
from clicking in the United States:
there is none of the periodicity of
thrills working up to a definite cli
max. It is this that gives to Ameri
can football its greatest charm . . .
But on the other hand there aro
few agonizing time-outs and out
of-bounds pauses as in the Ameri
can game. . . . Stanford Rugby Club
is scoring, seconds later the Bar
barian All-Blacks are threatening.
Like in basketball and ice hockey,
the whole complexion of the game
changes with uncanny speed.
Just a few months ago raltid
fans were cutting each others'
throats for $5 tickets to watch
Bill Corbus. Bill Sim. etc.. tackle,
and run. and block.
Go and see them tomorrow for
two-bits!

And don't be surprised if tlie
game is halted once or twice
while officials explain rugby
regulations. Just remember that
it is this very unfamiliarity with
the game that will probably
cause some of the most spec
tacular plays tomorrow.
Remember that it's not. the ninety
nine-yard run that makes history in
rugby; it's the vital kick that fol
lows. The Stanford Rugby Club
(sounds swell and afternoon teaish,
doesn't it?) will have the best kicker
lon the field tomorrow afternoon:
Norman Cleaveland. Of course there
will be others to help: Tex Walker,
Ben Palamountain, Scotchy Camp
bell, Bobby Grayson—more than
just big names. —A.J.G.
