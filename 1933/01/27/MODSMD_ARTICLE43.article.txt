# FROSH CAGERS TO FACE PREPS IN TWO FRAYS
## Meet Weak Lowell Outfit Today; Test Stockton's Champs Tomorrow 
### Albert Guerard 
Hoping to continue in their win
ning ways, Stanford's freshman bas
ketball players meet two high-school
quintets over the week-end. To
night, Lowell High, San Francisco's
fest-fading champions. Tomprrow,
Stockton High, the strongest prep
school team north of the Tehachapi.
Unable to score more than sixteen
points in any of its seven important
games played so far, Lowell is
primed for the Papoose battle to
night, determined to win from at
least one freshman team during the
1933 season, after losing to San
Francisco. Santa Clara, and Califor
nia yearling fives.
Lowell Easy?
Coach Rabbit Bradshaw and Cap
tain Addie Barnett will attempt to
take tonight's game in stride, sav
ing every ounce of energy,and bas
ketball skill for the Stockton con
test tomorrow. The Tarzans are the
perennial Valley champions.
Stockton has played only four im
portant games this seasonâ€”but what
a quartet! St. Mary's brilliant fresh
men were trounced, 30-18: Lowell
was downed 24-12; Galileo (the same
team that beat Stanford so easily)
was shellaced, 59-29. The latest ex
ploit is a 30-10 victory over Modesto
High.
