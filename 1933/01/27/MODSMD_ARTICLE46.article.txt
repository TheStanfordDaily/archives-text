### 
Having been rained out of three
games, and called off a fourth in
deference to the rugby game for
charity, Coach Harry Wolter has
definitely selected next Wednesday,
February 1, as the official opening
of the 1933 varsity baseball cam
paign.
Coach Wolter's men, as per sched
ule, will open against the Kenealy
Seals, a collection of major and
minor leaguers who winter in the
Bay region. Last year the varsity got
off to an impressive start by blank
ing the Seals 4-0.
Although there may be a shift or

two in the starting lineup, and most
of the regulars- will get into the
