# DEKE, SIGMA CHI WIN CLOSE MURAL BASKETBALL TILTS
## Breakers Swamp Theta Xi, El Tigre Trounced By Zeta Psi Outfit 
### 
Last night's Intramural Hoop re
sulted in two close games, one weird
result, and a fourth evenly played
contest.
In probably the best contest of
the evening the Phi Dclts defeated
the Dekes by a score of 20 to 1(>.
Sigma Chi in the other close game
beat the Alpha Dolts 18 to 13. In
the complete shutout the Theta Xi's
scored but one lone foul and lost to
the strong Breakers outfit, 37 to 1.
Zeta Psi defeated El Tigre 20 to 15.
Hershey was the main scoring threat
for the Zetes.
