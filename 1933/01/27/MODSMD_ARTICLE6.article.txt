# INDIAN-U.C.L.A TEAMS BATTLE HERE TONIGHT
## Squads To Play Tomorrow Night In Second Game Of Annual Series 
### 
Dick Strouse
Traveling five hundred miles for
the worthy purpose of playing two
basketball games, the Bruin from
Westwood steps out on the Pa
vilion floor at 8 o'clock tonight with
the inspiring cry of five thousand
Uclan fans in his ears and with the !
hope of mauling and pawing the
Stanford Indian in his heart. And
tomorrow night, Caddy Works'
trained bear will repeat his stepping
out with John Bunn's civilized
Indian.
Thrice Beaten
Although defeated thrice in Con
ference competition, Works brings
with him a dangerous and entertain
ing quintet. Headed by Captain-
Lemcke, the Bruin lineup will in
clude Brotemarkle at the other
guard, Binkley at center, and the I
always dangerous Piper and sopho
more Gibson at the forwards.

Facing this team will be Bunn's
strange and strong combination of
Cordry, Topping, Weaver, Hancock,
and Tod. Giving these five men po
sitions is a hazardous undertaking,
but it is undeniable that Captain
Cordry is a forward and that Jay
Tod is a guard. Weaver, however,
will have to be classed as a for
ward-guard, Topping as a center
forward, and Hancock as a guard
center. ,
Bunn worked his team with this
lineup through a hard scrimmage on
Wednesday, and yesterday let them
off with a light signal drill. The
photographer showed up at the Pa
vilion yesterday, and after the boys
had sat for their pictures, there
was not enough energy left for a
basketball game.
Use Fast Break
Because of the graduation of re
doubtable Dick Linthicum and be
cause of the new ruling making it
illegal for a man to hold the ball
within the free-throw circle with his |
back to his opponents' basket for
more than three seconds, U.C.L.A.
has revised the famous offense in |
which Linthicum used to feed Piper.
Caddy Works' five breaks fast now. I
Stanford too has employed a fast
breaking offense, and during the
week Bunn emphasized the neces
sity of shooting when free. Many
of the Indians have been modestly
reticent about* trying their luck at
the basket, and they have lost valu
able points because of that very be
coming modesty.
