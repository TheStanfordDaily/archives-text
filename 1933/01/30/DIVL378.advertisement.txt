After College
WHAT?
JSZ
Aviation?
E. E. Wyman, Assistant to the
President, Pan-American Airways
System, says: "Aviation is sym
pathetic to the college graduate
who has prepared himself. It
demands, however, serious and
thorough preparation: technical
training, a natural aptitude for
constant study of problems and
conditions, and a natural enthusi
asm for the tasks it develops."
AVIATION requires a steady hand
I for the pilot, a steady mind foi
rhe executive. And a good tobacco...
like Edgeworth Smoking Tobacco ...
is mighty helpful in giving a man a
steady hand, or a steady mind.
Only in Edgeworth will you find
that indefinable distinctiveness that is
brought about by a special blending
of fine old burleys. That's why lead
ing colleges have chosen it as their
favorite tobacco.*
Want to try before you buy? Just
Jrop a line to Larus SC. Bro. Co., 105
5. 22d St., Richmond, Va., for your
free sample pack. You'll enjoy that
rooling smoke that is so different.
