# RUGBY CONTEST SUCCESS; NETS $400 FOR FUND
## Stanford Scores 9 To 0 Win Over Barbarian Team By Long Rushes SECOND GAME PLANNED Quips By 'Dink' Templeton Edify Audience 
### Francis Hamilton 
After watching the Stanford rug
gers and their Barbarian opponents
carry on Saturday's charity game in
true holiday style, all who attended
voted this mad game as tops in en
tertainment. Nine to nothing was
the final score, but no one cared
about that. And incidentally, it was
more than successful financially.
With over four hundred dollars
cleared, and a few parties yet to be
heard from, it exceeded all hopes of
Les Hables and his committee.
Old Timers Play
Having all the features of a four
ring circus, the; rugby offered
laughs and thrills galore. Bald
headed and obese old timers scram
med it up with youngsters fresh off
the football field and finally faded
against the superior speed and en
durance of the novice ruggers.
One Barbarian, Barbier by name,
who was viewing the game from the
sideline, stepped out and tackled a
lone Cardinal as the latter was
treading a narrow path towards the
goal line. What's more, the referee
didn't catch him. That was nothing,
as the Barbarian crew numbered
seventeen men in their line-up at
one time. "Dink" Templeton kept
the crowd amused with his constant
and pungent remarks at the expense
of the players.
Mob On Field
With thirty men galloping about
the field and fiercely mauling each
other it was hard to pick the good
men. Three of the Stanford club
were marked as potentially great
material. You couldn't miss the
spectacular runs of Bill Sim, Bobby
Grayson and Johnny Reisner, who
scurried like scared rats through
the milling mess of combatants.
Both Grayson and Reisner ended
runs from over half the length the
field for "trys which counted three
points each. Chuck White scored
first when he took a short pass from
Grayson and went over from around
the five-yard line. No one was able
to connect with the field kicks,
which follow the "try" and which
corresponded to the conversion in
American football.
So enthusiastic was the support of
the contest, that Chairman Les
Hables of the promoting committee
is already seeking another opponent
to match with the Stanford club in
a second charity exhibition.
Co-operating with the trend,
Norman Cleaveland of the Stanford
team is preparing to challenge some
responsible organization at U.C.
