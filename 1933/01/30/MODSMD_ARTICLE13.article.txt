# Prohibition Repeal Nil; No Beer Joints In Paly
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Palo Alto isn't part of the United
Statesâ€”at least as far as prohibition
is concerned. If the 18th amend
ment is repealed, it will remain dry.
Drinking has never been allowed
in Palo Alto, Gordon Davis, Campus
police chief, said yesterday. (In fact,
(he temperance problem is the reas
on for the existence of the town.
Davis pointed out that when the
University was built, there was no
necessity of making Palo Alto the
University city.
Saloon Ban
Mayfield and Menlo were the two
places considered for (he site of
Stanford. Neither of these towns
would abolish the saloon, so the Palo
Alto region was selected in return
for a promise of prohibition enforce
ment.
Davis says that there has been no

trouble on the Campus over student
drinking. He has found no cases of
Stanfordites driving while intoxi
cated, and no accidents on the Cam
pus due to alcoholic drivers. Acci
dents due to any cause have been
practically nil on the Campus in
many months, Davis remarked, with
injuries from auto wrecks down to
the zero point.
Fraternity Hoax
The depression has not affected
the occasional light drinking by male
Stanfordites, Davis says.
A prohibition agent recently reg
istered at the University of Arizona,
posing as a well-to-do student. He
was rushed by several fraternities
and learned the names of 18 nearby
bootleggers. When the ruse was ex
posed, the college men were called
upon to testify in court against the
speakeasy proprietors.
