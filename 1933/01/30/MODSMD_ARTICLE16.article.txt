# DALADIER HEADS NEW CABINET IN PARIS SHAKE-UP
## One-Time Minister Of War Holds Leadership Of Socialist Group 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 29 (/P) —Edouard Da
ladier has been picked by President
Lebrun as the strong man to master
the turbulent chamber of deputies
and dissipate the clouds of unrest
and disorder throughout the coun
try.
Daladier, minister of war in the
cabinet of Premier Joseph Paul-
Boncour, which was swept out of
office Saturday by a defiant cham
ber, today accepted the invitation
of the President to attempt forma
tion of a new cabinet.
Outstanding Figure
He is the biggest figure since for
mer Premier Eduoard Herriot in the
ranks of the radical Socialists. This
group with its membership of 160 is
the largest party in the chamber.
If he is successful in forming a
cabinet, in which it was believed he
also would take the post of minister
of interior, he must face a budget
badly unbalanced, with a daily defi
cit of $1,250,000, and the shadow of a
debt default.
Straddles Debt Issue
Daladier's position on the debts
question is believed to be sufficient
ly vague to enable him to bridge the
gap between default and a resump
tion of payment. As a minister in
the cabinet of former Premier Her
riot he voted for payment of the
debts, but in party councils he ex
pressed reservations.
His reported intention to ask a
decree of power is worrying the So
cialists, whose support he is seeking.
They fear that if they refuse he will
form something akin to former Pre
mier Poincare's national union that
operated with almost dictatorial
methods.
