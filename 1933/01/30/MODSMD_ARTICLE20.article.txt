Ready to explain Stanford admin- ;
istrative problems before the ail- 1
University assembly scheduled for j
10 o'clock Wednesday morning, Al
mon E. Roth, '09, Comptroller of the !
University, asks that all students |
with any questions concerning the !
administration of Stanford write or j
take them to the Daily's editorial j
office.
Roth will answer all such ques- j
tions that are relevant or sensible, as |
well as dealing with certain others I
he has already considered worthy of j
attention. Included among those that ;

cina Dining Hall prices with the j
prices of Palo Alto establishments?" j

Roth does not guarantee to answer j
every question which might be 1
written. Those problems of current
general interest, however, will be |
dealt wi!h in his talk before the stu- 1
dent body. Better qualified to an- j
swer financial questions about Stan- j
ford than any other person con
nected with the University, Roth
will reveal facts and figures con- 1
cerning the administration of the :
Farm.
Arranged at the request of i
A.S.S.U. officials, the student as- j
sembly is designed to bring the Uni- J
versity administration into closer j
contact with those enrolled for study |
here. Six years ago an informational !
assembly- of this type was held with |
Comptroller Roth answering the j
many questions which arise con- j
cerning Stanford activities. Since j
that time new problems have de- j
veloped which concern everyone
connected with the University.
Concerning Tuition Notes
Registration days of recent quar- i
tors have seen fewer students march \
up to the accounting window to pay ]
the required fees. A long line is |
seen waiting to have tuition notes
approved. Roth has promised to an- '
swer the question, "What is the j
amount of tuition notes now out- '
standing? How can Stanford issue j
tuition notes?"
According to news reports, many J
of the Eastern universities have j
been much harder hit by enrollment j
drops due to the depression than has !
Stanford. The University of Minne- '
sota recently announced the biggest I
decline in enrollment in 15 years. J
Most of the universities of Stan
ford's rank have many more schol
arships to offer. Roth will tell Wed
nesday of Stanford's rank in respect
to scholarship funds.

tuition notes?"
According to news reports, many J
of the Eastern universities have j
been much harder hit by enrollment j
drops due to the depression than has !
Stanford. The University of Minne- '
sota recently announced the biggest I
decline in enrollment in 15 years. J
Most of the universities of Stan
ford's rank have many more schol
arships to offer. Roth will tell Wed
nesday of Stanford's rank in respect
to scholarship funds.
Ready to explain Stanford admin- ;
istrative problems before the ail- 1
University assembly scheduled for j
10 o'clock Wednesday morning, Al
mon E. Roth, '09, Comptroller of the !
University, asks that all students |
with any questions concerning the !
administration of Stanford write or j
take them to the Daily's editorial j
office.
Roth will answer all such ques- j
tions that are relevant or sensible, as |
well as dealing with certain others I
he has already considered worthy of j
attention. Included among those that ;
Roth has already prepared are, '"Why
is it unfair to compare Union or En- j
cina Dining Hall prices with the j
prices of Palo Alto establishments?" j
Is An Expert
Roth does not guarantee to answer j
every question which might be 1
written. Those problems of current
general interest, however, will be |
dealt wi!h in his talk before the stu- 1
dent body. Better qualified to an- j
swer financial questions about Stan- j
ford than any other person con
nected with the University, Roth
will reveal facts and figures con- 1
cerning the administration of the :
Farm.
Arranged at the request of i
A.S.S.U. officials, the student as- j
sembly is designed to bring the Uni- J
versity administration into closer j
contact with those enrolled for study |
here. Six years ago an informational !
assembly- of this type was held with |
Comptroller Roth answering the j
many questions which arise con- j
cerning Stanford activities. Since j
that time new problems have de- j
veloped which concern everyone
connected with the University.
Concerning Tuition Notes
Registration days of recent quar- i
tors have seen fewer students march \
up to the accounting window to pay ]
the required fees. A long line is |
seen waiting to have tuition notes
approved. Roth has promised to an- '
swer the question, "What is the j
amount of tuition notes now out- '
standing? How can Stanford issue j
tuition notes?"
