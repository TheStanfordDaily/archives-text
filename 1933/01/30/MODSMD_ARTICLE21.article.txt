WARM SPRINGS, Ga„ Jan. 29 (JP)
—In the seclusion of a cottage atop
Pine Mountain, President-elect
Roosevelt and Ambassador Lindsay
of Great Bi itain reached a tentative
understanding today for, the March
meetings on war debts and plans for
the world-wide economic recovery.
The fact that a statement given to
the press referred to "meetings"
rather than a meeting was inter
preted by some here to mean that
Roosevelt's desire for separate nego
tiations on debts and economics still
stands.
