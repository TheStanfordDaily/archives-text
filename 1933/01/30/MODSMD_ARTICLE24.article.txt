# DEAD-EYE BRUIN QUINTET SPLITS WITH CARD FIVE
## Stanford Men Come Back To 41 -38 Victory After Dropping Game PIPER IS HIGH SCORER Topping Leads Cardinals In Scoring; Cordry Plays Hard Game 
### Dick Strousc 
Of great interest to psychologists,
I sociologists, and other students of
j human behavior was the important
j scientific data furnished by five
! strong young men from the Univer
-1 sity of California at Los Angeles as
| they split their two game series
1 (with Stanford), winning 44 to 36
; Friday and losing 38 to 41 Saturday,
j It has been, in the past, customary
1 for ten strong young men playing
the gentle amateur game of basket
! ball to occasionally take pot-shots
|at a cast-iron hoop with dangling
j strings in the faint hope that the
I big brown ball would go through the
j hoop and count up two points for
j our side. And in the past, the ball
j would drop through about twenty
' per cent of the time and everyone
j would be happy and shout "Hurray
I for our side."
U.C.L.A. Radical
This orthodox and righteous one
| in five ration was completely upset,
I however, by the U.C.LA. boys in
i their two games with the Stanford
j boys over the week-end, and so
radical was their nullification of the
j old, established law of trial and er-
I ror that they made about forty per
! cent of their attempts at the basket
j and beat the Stanford boys Friday
night 44 to 36, and only lost on Saf
• urday by three points although the
j Stanford boys themselves were
' somewhat "hot."
Of course, this phenomenal shool
i ing is not quite according to Nai
! smith (who is the Hoyle of basket -
| ball) and it. might be termed luck
j were it not true that we would di -
j like disparaging the Southern boys'
j showing and anyway Stanford won
j the second game for her first Con
i ference victory. The final score was
41 to 38, and the Stanford boys
spent some minutes after the game
looking up at the scoreboard to be
! sure that the 41 was on the Stan
i ford side.
Hurray For Hal
Stanford's first victory was made
| possible by the reform of Hal Ede
! len, who until Saturday night had
j always been a very nice boy but
I not quite such great shakes as a
| basketball player. Hal was his usual
j efficient self on defense, and he also
| scored four field goals and by per
| feet floor work made a good num
! ber of Topping's 14 points possible.
This is not meant to deprecate
1 Topping, who scored 28 of Stanford's
| points in the two games and who
1 is the Cards' most finished player.
And Captain Cordry played his
{heart out, and showed why he is
i captain when, between the halves
jof the second game, he said, "I
can't shoot tonight, fellows; I'm go
j ing to fake my shots and feed Keith
( and Hal."
Boqucts For All
| Since boquets are cheap out here
; in sunny California, we might add
j that Jay Tod missed nary a free
throw Saturday night and also that
he landed with a loud thump on the
laps of some thrilled co-eds in one
of his ball-chasing rushes. And John
Hancock, poker-faced and perspir
ing, as usual was the team's steady
ing influence.
It might also be fair to mention
Don Piper and Brotemarkle of
U.C.L.A. Piper outscored Topping
in both games, and was the hottest
of the hot Uclans. Brotemarkle
stood back in his favorite spot and
dropped shot after shot through the
iron and string. And Referee Leitli
outscored the Stanford rooting sec
lion by one point when he called a
foul on his noisy hissers and then
allowed Piper to make it for him
and add it to the U.C.L.A. total.
§pccdy Games
Both games were hard, rough,
fast encounters, and very pleasant
for the spectators if not the players.
Although our trilling about Stan
ford's victory lias not been as vo
ciferous as Manager Don Cameron
and other basketball fans may war
rant, Stanford showed marvelous
improvement in splitting with a
team that even Caddy Works (its
coach) admitted was playing over
its head.
tiunn had ordered the boys to
break for the basket,. and High
Scorer Topping and Reformed Ede
len obeyed so well that most of the
Cardinal field goals were scored as
set-ups. Bunn had also ordered Tod
and Hancock to hold the ball longer
before starting it toward the basket,
and as a result when they finally
did pass to Captain Cordry in his
favorite corner, Tommy was either
free to shoot or to pass the ball in.
The boys meet Santa Clara tomor
row night in a game that may show
this skeptical campus more of
Bunn's wizardy.

Boqucts For All

throw Saturday night and also that
he landed with a loud thump on the
laps of some thrilled co-eds in one
of his ball-chasing rushes. And John
Hancock, poker-faced and perspir
ing, as usual was the team's steady
ing influence.
It might also be fair to mention
Don Piper and Brotemarkle of
U.C.L.A. Piper outscored Topping
in both games, and was the hottest
of the hot Uclans. Brotemarkle
stood back in his favorite spot and
dropped shot after shot through the
iron and string. And Referee Leitli
outscored the Stanford rooting sec
lion by one point when he called a
foul on his noisy hissers and then
allowed Piper to make it for him

§pccdy Games
Both games were hard, rough,
fast encounters, and very pleasant
for the spectators if not the players.
Although our trilling about Stan
ford's victory lias not been as vo
ciferous as Manager Don Cameron
and other basketball fans may war
rant, Stanford showed marvelous
improvement in splitting with a
team that even Caddy Works (its
coach) admitted was playing over
its head.
tiunn had ordered the boys to
break for the basket,. and High
Scorer Topping and Reformed Ede
len obeyed so well that most of the
Cardinal field goals were scored as
set-ups. Bunn had also ordered Tod
and Hancock to hold the ball longer
before starting it toward the basket,
and as a result when they finally
did pass to Captain Cordry in his
favorite corner, Tommy was either
free to shoot or to pass the ball in.
The boys meet Santa Clara tomor
row night in a game that may show
this skeptical campus more of
Bunn's wizardy.

1 (with Stanford), winning 44 to 36
; Friday and losing 38 to 41 Saturday,
j It has been, in the past, customary
1 for ten strong young men playing
the gentle amateur game of basket
! ball to occasionally take pot-shots
|at a cast-iron hoop with dangling
j strings in the faint hope that the
I big brown ball would go through the
j hoop and count up two points for
j our side. And in the past, the ball
j would drop through about twenty
' per cent of the time and everyone
j would be happy and shout "Hurray
I for our side."
U.C.L.A. Radical
This orthodox and righteous one
| in five ration was completely upset,
I however, by the U.C.LA. boys in
i their two games with the Stanford
j boys over the week-end, and so
radical was their nullification of the
j old, established law of trial and er-
I ror that they made about forty per
! cent of their attempts at the basket
j and beat the Stanford boys Friday
night 44 to 36, and only lost on Saf
• urday by three points although the
j Stanford boys themselves were
' somewhat "hot."
Of course, this phenomenal shool
i ing is not quite according to Nai
! smith (who is the Hoyle of basket -
| ball) and it. might be termed luck
j were it not true that we would di -
j like disparaging the Southern boys'
j showing and anyway Stanford won
j the second game for her first Con
i ference victory. The final score was
41 to 38, and the Stanford boys
spent some minutes after the game
looking up at the scoreboard to be
! sure that the 41 was on the Stan
i ford side.
Hurray For Hal
Stanford's first victory was made
| possible by the reform of Hal Ede
! len, who until Saturday night had
j always been a very nice boy but
I not quite such great shakes as a
| basketball player. Hal was his usual
j efficient self on defense, and he also
| scored four field goals and by per
| feet floor work made a good num
! ber of Topping's 14 points possible.
This is not meant to deprecate
1 Topping, who scored 28 of Stanford's
| points in the two games and who
1 is the Cards' most finished player.
And Captain Cordry played his
{heart out, and showed why he is
i captain when, between the halves
jof the second game, he said, "I
can't shoot tonight, fellows; I'm go
j ing to fake my shots and feed Keith
( and Hal."
Boqucts For All
| Since boquets are cheap out here
; in sunny California, we might add
j that Jay Tod missed nary a free
throw Saturday night and also that
he landed with a loud thump on the
laps of some thrilled co-eds in one
of his ball-chasing rushes. And John
Hancock, poker-faced and perspir
ing, as usual was the team's steady
ing influence.
It might also be fair to mention
Don Piper and Brotemarkle of
U.C.L.A. Piper outscored Topping
in both games, and was the hottest
of the hot Uclans. Brotemarkle
stood back in his favorite spot and
dropped shot after shot through the
iron and string. And Referee Leitli
outscored the Stanford rooting sec
lion by one point when he called a
foul on his noisy hissers and then
allowed Piper to make it for him
and add it to the U.C.L.A. total.
§pccdy Games
Both games were hard, rough,
fast encounters, and very pleasant
for the spectators if not the players.
Although our trilling about Stan
ford's victory lias not been as vo
ciferous as Manager Don Cameron
and other basketball fans may war
rant, Stanford showed marvelous
improvement in splitting with a
team that even Caddy Works (its
coach) admitted was playing over
its head.
tiunn had ordered the boys to
break for the basket,. and High
Scorer Topping and Reformed Ede
len obeyed so well that most of the
Cardinal field goals were scored as
set-ups. Bunn had also ordered Tod
and Hancock to hold the ball longer
before starting it toward the basket,
and as a result when they finally
did pass to Captain Cordry in his
favorite corner, Tommy was either
free to shoot or to pass the ball in.
The boys meet Santa Clara tomor
row night in a game that may show
this skeptical campus more of
Bunn's wizardy.
