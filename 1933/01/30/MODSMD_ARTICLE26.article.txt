# HE GOT THE BOOK

### 
Milking something extremely complicated out of some
thing very simple is ordinarily looked upon as a human
failing. Hut 111<» manner in which the desk attendants in
Hie reserve hook room in the library have complicated the
commonly insignificant process of borrowing a book is
more than that it is a work of art.
First the prospective book-borrower, one that is too
considerate of studying comrades to shout brazenly for
attention, must devise all sorts of subtle and intricate
tricks, to attract the eve of a clerk. After finally succeed
ing in I his, the eye is probably all he'll get for a few more
moments until, n apparently reluctant, the 1 clerk moves
toward him.

Now let us imagine that it is 9:30 p.m., and that the
baffled student is trying to get a book out for overnight, a
hook that he has already had in his possession for forty
live minutes "or so on a "two hours" slip. The attendant
informs him that he can't have il since he has already had
his crack al it, and that the book must be turned in to be
snatched up by whoeVer is lucky in the ensuing scramble.
Hut the student, his wits keyed bv the dillicully of the
lask he h;is undertaken, sees a way out.
"Here, Joe," he says to a friend beside him. "Take it out
for me."
Hul the desk attendant, sensing that Joe is not even in
Ihc course requiring that book, throws up his hands in
horror at such tactics. The student, laboring under the de
lusion that the system as il now operates leaves a book
free, the moment il is turned in, for any proud possessor of
a student body card to lake out# is bewildered. He can't
see how il is any of the desk attendant's business whether
thai man is his friend, or js bowlegged, or has a gold tooth,
for that matter.

Exasperated, almost exhausted, the prospective book
borrower says okeh, he'll just keep the hook, and skim an
important part in the remaining five minutes before the
bell. He sneaks out into the lobby, grabs another friend
by the arm, warns him that fhev must be strangers at the
desk, tells him to follow right on his heels and grab the
hook as soon as il touches the counter. He gets the book,
.and walks out weak.

Perhaps there is something wrong with the system.
More likely the fault lies with a desk attendant whose fail
ure to observe il penalizes openness, encourages deceit.
Alter all, he is paid to hand available books to men wtih
student body cards not to sit as an all-seeing god who
judges cases in the* ethics of book-borrowing.
