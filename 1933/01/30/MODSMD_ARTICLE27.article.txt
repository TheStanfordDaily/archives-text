Roo—(><)!
The crowd was at il again. The game was getting ex
citing. Stanford was trailing by two points and seemed to
he growing stronger. The Indian five were giving the best
they had to overcome the slight lead.
The booing rose to a high shriek when Referee Leilh
penalized Stanford with a personal foul. The Bruin came
up to the mark to lake his shots. The booing increased.
The Stanford team tried to quiet Hie bleachers bul nothing
seemed to have anv effect.
Referee Leilh. stepped in at this point and called a
technical foul. The Bruin shot all three of his tries. Il gave
I C.L.A. a commanding lead with only about ten minutes
left to play.
Lvery right thinking person in I lie stands mentally con
gratulated Referee Leilh. Kditorial upbraiding, a request
from the coach, and even pleas from the players had failed
lo slop Ihe crowd's jeers, but the referee stopped the cat
calls with one definite action.
(loach John Bunn and Captain Cordry should make il
plain to every oflicial who is going to work in the Pavilion
for the rest of the season that they expect him to call a
technical foul for all cases of mass booing that occur.
The booing will stop, for even the upper five percent
know when they are committing suicide.
