# BULL SESSION
## BOO 
### 
Saturday night is memorable in
more than one way. First of all we
won a basketball game—which will
go down with the Roosevelt Ava
lanche as probably the two land
marks of this generation. There is a
group of historians that count time
from the upsetting of the Napoleonic
apple-cart at Waterloo. Stanford Pa
vilion will be substituted for Water
loo—l 933 for 1815.
Saturday is also notewort'h be
cause it was Saturday when basket
ball booing at the Farm became
more rapacious than jever. New highs
on bronx-cheering were registered;
and all sides of the Pavilion offered
plenty of groans to any who might
take them. The crowd and the teams
were in a great humor.
But one of the referees—whether
out, of a guilty conscience or a
super-inflated ego—took the booing
personally; stalked to the Stanford
stands, waved his fingers, and the
Cardinal team found themselves with
another "foul" charged against them.
I was almost hoping that U.C.L.A.
would win by the one point that this
stunt netted them, so that the crowds
could go home with something to
talk about.
Booing is not a gentlemanly occu
pation in the sense thai if you booed
at the reading of a "paper" at the
American Society for the Advance
ment of Science, eyebrows would be
arched and pointed in your direc

tion. To hiss a halitosised debutante
as she tried to sweep into the parlor
at a formal tea, would be a bit un
usual.
But booing at a basketball game
seems great. For four years Stanford
students have watched Stanford bas
ketball teams fall prey to anyone
who wished to play the vulture. And
in all this time, the stands have
never felt any malice or resentment.
They took it with philosophical
resignation—like the moving of the
planets in their circuits. The gods
had so decreed.
The stands had their own fun—
irrespective of what the team might
or might not do. They booed. It was
such a simple pleasure—so innocent
—so sweet. After the saturation
point in peanuts has been reached,
what else is there to do at a basket
ball game but boo. It adds color to
the game; transforms every student
into a critic and judge; and annoys
no one except Big Chief "Sitting-on
a-Tack" Barry and sour-spleened
referee.
All referees are booed. Some stim
ulate more vocal chords in the
stands than others. The one Saturday
night was some kind of a prize. If
booing is to be kept to an ordinary
level, somebody had better keep
some referees off the floor.
Just general booing is O.K. Booing
a player as he shoots is, of course,
not-so-good. —Abe Mellinkoff

But one of the referees—whether
out, of a guilty conscience or a
super-inflated ego—took the booing
personally; stalked to the Stanford
stands, waved his fingers, and the
Cardinal team found themselves with
another "foul" charged against them.
I was almost hoping that U.C.L.A.
would win by the one point that this
stunt netted them, so that the crowds
could go home with something to
talk about.
Booing is not a gentlemanly occu
pation in the sense thai if you booed
at the reading of a "paper" at the
American Society for the Advance
ment of Science, eyebrows would be
arched and pointed in your direc

tion. To hiss a halitosised debutante
as she tried to sweep into the parlor
at a formal tea, would be a bit un
usual.
But booing at a basketball game
seems great. For four years Stanford
students have watched Stanford bas
ketball teams fall prey to anyone
who wished to play the vulture. And
in all this time, the stands have
never felt any malice or resentment.
They took it with philosophical
resignation—like the moving of the
planets in their circuits. The gods
had so decreed.
The stands had their own fun—
irrespective of what the team might
or might not do. They booed. It was
such a simple pleasure—so innocent
—so sweet. After the saturation
point in peanuts has been reached,
what else is there to do at a basket
ball game but boo. It adds color to
the game; transforms every student
into a critic and judge; and annoys
no one except Big Chief "Sitting-on
a-Tack" Barry and sour-spleened
referee.
All referees are booed. Some stim
ulate more vocal chords in the
stands than others. The one Saturday
night was some kind of a prize. If
booing is to be kept to an ordinary
level, somebody had better keep
some referees off the floor.
Just general booing is O.K. Booing
a player as he shoots is, of course,
not-so-good. —Abe Mellinkoff
Saturday night is memorable in
more than one way. First of all we
won a basketball game—which will
go down with the Roosevelt Ava
lanche as probably the two land
marks of this generation. There is a
group of historians that count time
from the upsetting of the Napoleonic
apple-cart at Waterloo. Stanford Pa
vilion will be substituted for Water
loo—l 933 for 1815.
Saturday is also notewort'h be
cause it was Saturday when basket
ball booing at the Farm became
more rapacious than jever. New highs
on bronx-cheering were registered;
and all sides of the Pavilion offered
plenty of groans to any who might
take them. The crowd and the teams
were in a great humor.
