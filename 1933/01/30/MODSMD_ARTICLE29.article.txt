LETTER WRITERS OF TIIE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. II —
Lord Chesterfield.
It is difficult to think of Lord
Chesterfield's letters to his son with
out remembering Johnson's famous
dictum: "They teach the morals of
a whore and the manners of a danc
ing master." Less often is it remem
bered that is also said: "Take out
the immorality and it should bo put
into the hands of every young gen
tleman."
At a time when many Guides of
Youth were being published, Ches
terfield's letters are surprising in
their sincerity. Of course this is ex
plained by the fact that they were
never intended for publication, being
meant rather as an actual guide for
a particular young gentleman, and
written for that purpose by an au
thor who really knew what he was
talking about. Their privacy allowed
for straightforward information
which an author writing for the
general public could not have used.
A hack writer must be moral or he
is considered indecent. That a mor
alist is usually a hypocrite does not
seem to matter. Moreover, the
slightest air of the reformer in Ches
terfield would have loomed with
ludicrous hugeness; alas, Chester
field was writing to the result of his
own youthful gallantry.
The letters are not, in the accepted
sense, a book of etiquette. They are
too comprehensive for that, too per
sonal; but their purpose was to de
fine good breeding. The tone of the
composition harmonizes nicely with
the content. Discussing the parts of
a gentleman, Chesterfield writes: "A
pretty person, genteel motions, a

proper degree of dress, an harmoni
ous voice, something open and
cheerful in the countenance, but
without laughing; a distinct and
varied manner of speaking—all these
things and many othei-s are neces
sary ingredients in the composition
of the pleasing 'je ne scair quoi'
which everybody feels, tho nobody
can describe."
In view of Johnson's damning
statement one is disappointed that
Chesterfield's definition docs not run
more exactly true to Sir Fopling
Flutter's "a complete gentleman
ought to dress well, dance well,
fence well, have a genius for love
