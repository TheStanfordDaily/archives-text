DISARM
The Editor, Sir:
May I, as an old Stanford student,
say a word to you on a most im
portant subject? The International
Conference on Disarmament has re

largely the hopeful future of the

world. Much was done at the last
meeting, though arithmetical limita
tions were not arrived at. This year
the American proposals, differentia
tion between offensive and defensive
arms, reduction of armaments all
around to what each nation needs
for its' home use and so on, are to
be the bases of discussion.
It is not only dread of war's hor

but the conviction that there is

something better to fight for, and a
better end of fighting, than to be
bloody corpses in a stinking trench.
Do you realize that we are at one
of the great turning points of his
tory.' That there is infinitely more
important work for the colossal
sums sunk in offensive armaments or
blown away in ammunition than to
be spent in destroying our fellow
men? Thirty million men and wo
men are unemployed today in the
