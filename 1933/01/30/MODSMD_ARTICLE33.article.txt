DISARM
The Editor, Sir:
May I, as an old Stanford student,
say a word to you on a most im
portant subject? The International
Conference on Disarmament has re
: sumed at Geneva its sitting begun
last year. Its president, Arthur Hen
derson, has said that upon the suc
cess *of this meeting depends very
largely the hopeful future of the

world. Much was done at the last
meeting, though arithmetical limita
tions were not arrived at. This year
the American proposals, differentia
tion between offensive and defensive
arms, reduction of armaments all
around to what each nation needs
for its' home use and so on, are to
be the bases of discussion.
It is not only dread of war's hor
rors that is at the back of the de
mand for disarmament and peace,
but the conviction that there is

something better to fight for, and a
better end of fighting, than to be
bloody corpses in a stinking trench.
Do you realize that we are at one
of the great turning points of his
tory.' That there is infinitely more
important work for the colossal
sums sunk in offensive armaments or
blown away in ammunition than to
be spent in destroying our fellow
men? Thirty million men and wo
men are unemployed today in the
world's workers—a symptom of the
i civilized world, one-sixth of the
disorganization of our time. This has
; to be put right. Great social changes
| are impending. It is the young men
j and women of the universities, who
! will have to fight these issues—and
should not the Stanford of David
Starr Jordan be the first in the lead?
There have been abundant argu
ments and statistics about disarma
ment —what is wanted now is action.
The Conference says it needs popu
lar backing. Back it then. Send a
message that you want —demand—a
beginning of disarmament and
peace. Get the other universities to

do likewise. Bombard the conference
with appeals. It is time to shed the
woeful heritage from our coal-men
ancestors —hate, jealousy, and greed
—not only in our own country but
between the countries of the world.
We want peace, good will among
men. —D. R. McConnel
The subject of a recent McGill
University debate was: Resolved, It
is better to be drunk than to be in
love.
