# Frosh Five Impressive In Wins Over Stockton, Lowell
## YEARLINGS DOWN STOCKTON 24-23, LOWELL HI 29-23 Surprise Power Shown By Lowell; Babe Guards In Topnotch Form 
### Albert Guerard 
Rapidly developing into Stanford's
most successful athletic team, Rab
bit Bradshaw's freshman basketball
team won two impressive victories
over the week-end. The yearlings
encountered unexpected opposition
with Lowell High on Friday, but
won 29-213. Saturday brought the
outstanding win of the season, a
24-22 victory over Stockton High's
famous quintet.
The best Indian lineup: Greenlee,
center; Mannion and Viguie, for
wards; Burnett and Fabcr, guards,
started against Lowell, and quickly
ran up a 7-2 lead, which was
stretched to 13-7 at the end of the
first quarter. Addie Barnett's three
field goals helped the Stanford
cause materially during the first
quarter, but during the ensuing ten
minutes Stanford's scoring machine
was completely bottled up. Lowell
secured a 17-15 lead at halftime, as
three Indian reserve players: Katz
and Brooke, forwards; Nobs, center,
failed to match the defensive piny
of the first string forward wall.
Lowell Surprises
Lowell's first half showing was a
big surprise to the Stanford players,
who came back on the court with
much determination and a newly
found ability to sink free throws.
Stanford led, 25-22, at (he end of
the third quarter, and ran the lead
to 29-2.') before the end of the game.
In .spite of this '"rally," only four
field goals were made during the
second half, ten points being gained
through free throws.
Stockton's mighty Tarzans stayed
on the bench during the first quar
ter of the freshman game, and
watched the Indians run up a 10-5
lead. The prepsters' regular five
then went into the game and during
the second quarter scored ten points,
while Stanford was limited to a
single free throw. Stockton led, 1011.
ll. at halftime.
Defense Strong
Stanford's defense was a thing of
beauty during the second half. The
Stockton forwards "broke" with un
canny speed, whirled, pivoted—but
a Stanford guard was always right
on top of them. The Tarzans made
only two field goals during the last
twenty minutes, both on long
"prayer" shots. Field goals by Man
nion and Greenlee tied the score at
18-18, just, two minutes before the
end of the third quarter. Greenlee
and Viguie quickly tanked two more
close-in shots, and the ePapooses felt
fairly secure with a 22-18 lead.
Bradshaw s men did some very
smooth stalling during the closing
minutes of the game, and after
stretching the score to 24-22, the
Indians ended the game passing the
ball back and forth between the
guards.

ran up a 7-2 lead, which was
stretched to 13-7 at the end of the
first quarter. Addie Barnett's three
field goals helped the Stanford
cause materially during the first
quarter, but during the ensuing ten
minutes Stanford's scoring machine
was completely bottled up. Lowell
secured a 17-15 lead at halftime, as
three Indian reserve players: Katz
and Brooke, forwards; Nobs, center,
failed to match the defensive piny
of the first string forward wall.
Lowell Surprises
Lowell's first half showing was a
big surprise to the Stanford players,
who came back on the court with
much determination and a newly
found ability to sink free throws.
Stanford led, 25-22, at (he end of
the third quarter, and ran the lead
to 29-2.') before the end of the game.
In .spite of this '"rally," only four
field goals were made during the
second half, ten points being gained
through free throws.
Stockton's mighty Tarzans stayed
on the bench during the first quar
ter of the freshman game, and
watched the Indians run up a 10-5
lead. The prepsters' regular five
then went into the game and during
the second quarter scored ten points,
while Stanford was limited to a
single free throw. Stockton led, 1011.
ll. at halftime.
Defense Strong
Stanford's defense was a thing of
beauty during the second half. The
Stockton forwards "broke" with un
canny speed, whirled, pivoted—but
a Stanford guard was always right
on top of them. The Tarzans made
only two field goals during the last
twenty minutes, both on long
"prayer" shots. Field goals by Man
nion and Greenlee tied the score at
18-18, just, two minutes before the
end of the third quarter. Greenlee
and Viguie quickly tanked two more
close-in shots, and the ePapooses felt
fairly secure with a 22-18 lead.
Bradshaw s men did some very
smooth stalling during the closing
minutes of the game, and after
stretching the score to 24-22, the
Indians ended the game passing the
ball back and forth between the
guards.
Rapidly developing into Stanford's
most successful athletic team, Rab
bit Bradshaw's freshman basketball
team won two impressive victories
over the week-end. The yearlings
encountered unexpected opposition
with Lowell High on Friday, but
won 29-213. Saturday brought the
outstanding win of the season, a
24-22 victory over Stockton High's
famous quintet.
The best Indian lineup: Greenlee,
center; Mannion and Viguie, for
wards; Burnett and Fabcr, guards,
started against Lowell, and quickly
ran up a 7-2 lead, which was
stretched to 13-7 at the end of the
first quarter. Addie Barnett's three
field goals helped the Stanford
