# Darr Stresses Need Of Spiritual Vision In U.S.
## 
### 
With the theme, "The people that
have no vision shall perish,'' the
Reverend John W. Darr, visiting
preacher and professor of religion at
Scripps College, delivered a sermon
yesterday morning in the Memorial
Church.
From this Bible reference he
showed that it is not material things,
but spiritual goods by which each
man is judged. As a man is judged,
so is a nation, and the United States,
the leader of the day, must find that
the new way of looking at things is
through religion, in order to hold its
place.
