STANFORD ROOTERS, if
they continue their practice of
booing referees in such a manner
as they did here Saturday night,
are apt to put Coach John
Bunn's basketballcrs in a much
more precarious position than
they faced in those closing min
utes when a point either way
might mean the game.
Before hostilities started Coach
Caddy Works asked John Bunn if
there was anything that could be
done about the fact that the Stanford
rooters were quiet when the Indians
were taking free throws and ex
tremely noisy when the Bruins were
shooting theirs. Works is not an un
reasonable person, and his request
was a logical one. No one objects to
a fellow having a good time at a
basketball game, but put yourself in
Bunn's place and see if you can
figure out an intelligent answer.
IF ALL THESE FELLOWS
who set off the throaty bronx
cheers with such gusto knew all
the rules perfectly, no one would
object to their booing. BUT, if
this were the case, there would
have been darn little razzing at
Saturday night's contest, for
most of the boots were against

I U.C.L.A. and Stanford got away
with plenty. Conservatively es
timated, there are hardly two
out of every fifty people in Stan
ford who actually know any
thing very useful about basket
ball rules. This is amply shown
by the decisions against which
they protested.
It isn't that we are accusing Stan
forcites of being such bad sports, but
their IS such a thing as giving the
other fellow a decent break. AND.
last but not least, when there is an
official who can be goaded into giv
ing technical shots, it is just plain
I suicide to keep on razzing him. It
would be too bad if we had to lose
a game to impress this on Stanford
fans. Give the teams a chance to
enjoy the game, too, and if you must
bleat, learn when to bleat.
AMONG THOSE WHO DESERVE
high praise for the success of the
rugby game, according to Abe
Hables, is C. C. Langevin, who made
the broadcasting of the game pos
sible. Mr. Langevin donated the ser
vices of the entire staff of trained
men that is required to work the
loudspeaker system in the Stadium.
