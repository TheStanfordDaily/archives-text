# CLUBMEN CAPTURE SABER TITLE FROM CARD, U.C. TEAMS
## 5-4 Win Over Bears Puts Campus Fencers In Second Place 
### 
Stanford and California fencers
bowed to the Olympic Club Friday
night at the Encina gym when the
Winged O's captured the annual
saber team championship in easy
style. In a round-robin affair, the
clubmen succeeded in defeating
California and Stanford by scores
of 7-2, 7-2.
Stanford ended up in second posi
tion, however, by_ defeating the
Bears 5-4 in the most interesting
match of the evening.
Lorbor Stars for U.C. ,
Led by Ted Lorber, member of
the U.S. Olympic foil team, and
the high individual match winner of
the evening, the Olympic Club had
little trouble in first vanquishing
the Bears, and later the Cards in
decisive fashion. Other members of
the winner's squad included Ferrard
Leicester and Bud Smith.
Leonard Pockman was high indi
vidual winner for the Cards, win
ning three matches in the Califor
nia tourney and taking one of the
two matches won by the tribe in
the Olympic Club battle. John
Ferguson won two of his six
matches, one each in the California
and Olympic Club encounters.
Cards Lack Practice
Considering the one week of prac
tice that preceded the meet, Stan
ford fencers have not given up hope
entirely and are hoping to get re
venge this Friday night when the
annual foil team championships are
expected to be held at U.C.
