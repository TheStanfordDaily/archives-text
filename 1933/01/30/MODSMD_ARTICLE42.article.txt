# FROSH WATER POLOISTS BEAT OLYMPIC JUNIORS IN BEST SHOWING OF SEASON
## 
### 
Displaying power in all depart
ments of the game, Coach Nort
Thornton's freshman water polo
team defeated the Olympic Club
Juniors last Saturday afternoon in
the Encina pool by a 7 to 2 score.
The Indian Babes showed more
power and class in this contest than
they had yet this season.
Starring for the yearlings was
Red Rulison, flashy forward, who
was high point man of the contest.
Captain De Myers, Woodard, and
Danforth also contributed their
shares to the scoring spree.
One of the principal reasons for

the frosh win was the fine playing
of Ken Livingston, goal guard. His
play was matched only by the great
exhibition of Red Rulison.
Thornton's starting line-up for the
contest was Rulison, Danforth, and
Ludlum at forwards; Captain Myers,
Woodard, and Baxter at guards; and
Livingston, goal guard.
