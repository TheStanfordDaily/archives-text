# WATER POLOISTS DEFEAT O. C. SPLASHERS 8 TO 4
## 
### BY WILLARD BUNGAY 
Stanford's varsity water polo team
successfully crossed the first, and
possibly most difficult, barrier be
tween it and the championship of
the Northern California Water Polo
League Saturday when it decisively
defeated the Olympic Club 8 to 4
in Encina pools.
The Indians had too much speed
and stamina for the veteran club
men, who were able to hold their
younger opponents to a 3 to 2 score
during the first half, but were prac
tically helpless against the strong,
fast-passing attack of Coach Nort
Thornton's men in the second pe
riod.
New Style Play
Vlad Taranik and Gordy Graves
tied for high scoring honors, each
snaring three goals. Ted Wiget and
Jimmy Triolo got one apiece. How
ever under the new Hungarian
style of play which has been adopted
by the Stanford team, no one man
stands out in the lineup as they all

feed the ball to the breaking guards.
Ted Wiget at sprint was especially
effective; he won the tipolT every
time. Captain Burke Knapp played
up to his usual standard as an all-
Pacific Coast goal-guard. When he
left the game in the second period,
his place was very well filled by
Leo Cook, sensational sophomore.
Other Stanford players were: for
wards, Jimmy Benet and Dick
Hirsch, and Don Kinkead, guard.
Austin Star
Ginger Austin, former Stanford
star and member of the 1924 Ameri
can Olympic team was the outstand
ing man i*u' the Olympic Club.
Elmer Collett, a former Card and
Olympic goalie, played a strong
game, but was helpless before the
Indians' new attach.
