# Gledhill Scores Flashy Victory Over Australian
## 
### 
Keith Gledhiil, Stanford's repre
sentative in International Tennis
circles, has scored another notable
victory in the Australian Tour
matches.
Playing with a brand of tennis that
justifies his being a member of the
four outstanding young Americans
now touring the Antipodes, Gledhiil
two days ago defeated Vivian Mc-
Garth, sensational young Australian,
in the finals of one of the tourna
ments by scores of 6-4, 6-1, 6-1.
His victory was all the more no
table in that the sixteen-year-old
native had beaten Gledhiil earlier in
the tour, and in the semi-finals the
other day defeated Ellsworth Vines,
acknowledged as the peer of the four
traveling Davis Cuppers.
Women at U.C.L.A. have little use
for the men's beard-growing contest.
