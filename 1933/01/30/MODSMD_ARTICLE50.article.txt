Thirty-five proposals in two days
is the boast of two Stanford co-eds.
This surge of popularity came as
a result of their being the
first to plunge into the muddy
waters of Lagunita. According to an
improvised legend circulated on the
campus, the first girl to swim in
Lagunita each year will receive a
proposal of marriage before June.

waters during a hail and rain storm
last Friday afternoon, phone calls
began coming at regular intervals
to the girls' house. Even John Gil
bert called up, they maintain,' and
one of them received a call from
New York. Ole Svenson, one of the
more ardent suitors, won an invita
tion for supper.
"Oh, the water was marvelous,"
they stated. "Yes, we accepted all 35
of the callers. But what we really
wanted was to swim, and we don't
consider any of the proposals seri
ous," the two members of the "'00"
said emphatically.
One of the girls says she was the
first swimmer two years ago, and
the other thinks she was about third
last year.
CHICAGO, Jan. 29 (/P)—Whether
the new anti-stalling rules are re
