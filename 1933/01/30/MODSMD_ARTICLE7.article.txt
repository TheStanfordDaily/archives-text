# Lagunita Boating Looms As Water Nears Brim
## 
### 
Canoes may be gliding about the
surface of Lagunita within a week,
according to a variety of sources
questioned last night. But it all de
pends—
If the flume which diverts the
waters, of San Francisquito creek
into the lake should continue to run
as at present, it will be full enough
for boating in a few days. For it is
reported to be already within five
feet of the top.
And whether the flume continues
to run depends on two circum
stances. Continued rain in this vi
cinity may d othe trick. Or Sears
ville lake may overflow, in which
case Lagunita will succeed to the
surplus.
Searsville Near Top
Latest information indicates that
the waters of Searsville are already
near the top of the dam. And it need
not continue to rain in order to fill
it, for this reservoir drains an ex
tensive watershed, whose seepage
will continue to flow in for several
days.
Last year the lake filled nearly a
month before this, and emptied itself

early in the spring. This year it is
expected to stay full until later in
the season, just as it has filled later
also.
No Swimming
When Ernst Brandsten, advisory
director of water sports, deems the
waters of Lagunita high enough, he
will give the word. Then out will
come the gay-colored canoes, and
the Stanford rough may give his fair
maiden a watery ride.
But no swimming—it's too cold!
The water is reported to be as cold
as the snow in the mountains from
which it came, and ordinary Stan
ford roughs are not expected to
emulate the two hardy maidens who
have already jumped the gun.
Rain Expected
When the icy waters have reached
the brim—if they do—the flumes
above will be closed, and the rest
of the water will go tumbling down
San Francisquito creek and into the
salty bay.
According to Associated Press dis
patches, snow and rain are expected
to continue along the Pacific Coast
for several days, with rain expected
in the San Francisco Bay region.
