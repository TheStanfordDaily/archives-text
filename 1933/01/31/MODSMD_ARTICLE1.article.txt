# CARDS FAVORED TO WIN BRONCO CLASH TONIGHT
## Victory Tonight Will Be Aid To Possible Win Over California FAST TILT EXPECTED Santa Clara Out To Stop Indians' "Hoodoo" 
### 
Another choice basketball game
will be dished up to fans here to
night when Coach John Bunn's
Stanford quintet engages the Santa
Clara Broncos in the Indians' last
practice skirmish before they run
up against California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. in successive week-end
conference battles.
TIPOFF TIMES
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's fresh
man live meets the Santa Clara
Cdlts at 6:30 o'clock tonight, with
the varsity tipoll' scheduled for
X o'clock.
Always listed as a tough opponent,
Santa Clara has, in the last two
tie, but has lost out in the closing
years, given Stanford plenty of bat
minutes. Tonight Stanford will ac
tually enter the game the slight
favorite to win. A spectacular come
back against U.C.L.A. here Saturday
night, while Coach Harlan Dykes'
Mission live was dropping a bad
game to the San Francisco Young
Men's Institute, is the principal
basis of the odds.
Nicholas, Slavich Stars
Dykes' mainstays this season have
been Jimmy Nicholas, who will be
remembered by local fans for his
great v/ork here last winter, and
Frank "Hands" Slavich, the big end
who did so well for "Clipper" Smith
in football. Slavich has played both
center and guard this season, but
will line up probably at the pivot
position this evening.
Coach Bunn whipped his men
through a tough workout yesterday
afternoon with the hopes of keep
ing them in the shape that enabled
them to squeak through in the sec
ond Ucla game. Bunn said after the
game that his men were lucky to
pull through, and he figures that
they will face an equally tough as
signment tonight.
A victory over Santa Clara would
establish Stanford's chances of beat
ing California here Saturday night,
for the win would put the needed
edge on the Indian playing.
Same Lineup Likely
Bunn has not announced a start
ing lineup, but intimated yesterday
that he is "likely" to again start
Captain Tommy Cordry and Hal
Edelen at forwards, Keith Topping
at center, Jay Tod and John Han
cock at guards.
The work of Edelen Saturday
evening impressed Stanford fans and
bolstered their hopes of having an
other offensive combination to throw
at opponents. Carrel Weaver would
(it in the other. "Chuck" Rogers has
been improving at guard and may
get a show.

(it in the other. "Chuck" Rogers has
been improving at guard and may
get a show.

Another choice basketball game
will be dished up to fans here to
night when Coach John Bunn's
Stanford quintet engages the Santa
Clara Broncos in the Indians' last
practice skirmish before they run
up against California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. in successive week-end
conference battles.
TIPOFF TIMES
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's fresh
man live meets the Santa Clara
Cdlts at 6:30 o'clock tonight, with
the varsity tipoll' scheduled for
X o'clock.
Always listed as a tough opponent,
Santa Clara has, in the last two
tie, but has lost out in the closing
years, given Stanford plenty of bat
minutes. Tonight Stanford will ac
tually enter the game the slight
favorite to win. A spectacular come
back against U.C.L.A. here Saturday
night, while Coach Harlan Dykes'
Mission live was dropping a bad
game to the San Francisco Young
Men's Institute, is the principal
basis of the odds.
Nicholas, Slavich Stars
Dykes' mainstays this season have
been Jimmy Nicholas, who will be
remembered by local fans for his
great v/ork here last winter, and
Frank "Hands" Slavich, the big end
who did so well for "Clipper" Smith
in football. Slavich has played both
center and guard this season, but
will line up probably at the pivot
position this evening.
Coach Bunn whipped his men
through a tough workout yesterday
afternoon with the hopes of keep
ing them in the shape that enabled
them to squeak through in the sec
ond Ucla game. Bunn said after the
game that his men were lucky to
pull through, and he figures that
they will face an equally tough as
signment tonight.
A victory over Santa Clara would
establish Stanford's chances of beat
ing California here Saturday night,
for the win would put the needed
edge on the Indian playing.
Same Lineup Likely
Bunn has not announced a start
ing lineup, but intimated yesterday
that he is "likely" to again start
Captain Tommy Cordry and Hal
Edelen at forwards, Keith Topping
at center, Jay Tod and John Han
cock at guards.
The work of Edelen Saturday
evening impressed Stanford fans and
bolstered their hopes of having an
other offensive combination to throw
at opponents. Carrel Weaver would
(it in the other. "Chuck" Rogers has
been improving at guard and may
get a show.
