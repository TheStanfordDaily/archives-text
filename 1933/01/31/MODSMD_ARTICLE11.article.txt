LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30 (/P) â€”
Recoi'd mountain snows blanketed
California peaks yesterday, taking a
toll of three lives and trapping
week-end visitors in the mountains.
Two men died of exposure and a
third was crushed beneath a roof
which crashed under the weight of
two feet of snow.
The State was rushing aid last
night to 300 motorists who were
stranded by a blizzard while return
ing from the annual sports carnival
at Lake Arrowhead.
Reports of a fresh Alaskan storm
starting southeastward down the
,coast to bring 36 hours more of rain
and snow hurried the state snow
plows to the stranded group.
