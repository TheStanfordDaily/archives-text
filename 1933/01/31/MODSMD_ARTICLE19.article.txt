# HITLER TO HEAD GERMAN CABINET
## Accepts Post On Terms Of Von Hindenburg 
### 
BERLIN, Jan. 30 $P)—Adolf Hit
ler achieved his long-sought goal—
the Chancellorship of the Reich—to
day, and Nationalist Germany was
thrown into a paroxysm of joy at the
union of President von Hindenburg
and the Nazi leader in a common
effort to pull the fatherland out of
the mire.
Hitler, having at last attained the
coveted goal, must now show
whether the Messiah-like hopes of
13,000,000 Germans in his statesman
ship are justified.
Efforts of Hitlerites, as well as of
the Nationalist followers of Dr. Al
fred Hugenberg, at last triumphed
in bringing the thx*ee great move
ments of the right—the Nazis, the
Nationalists, and the members of
the Steel Helmet War Veterans' As
sociation—together after many ups
and downs since they met for com
mon effort at Harsburg in October,
Presiding over the first session of
1931.
his Cabinet of "national concentra
tion," Chancellor Hitler tonight put
through unanimous motions against
all policies of suppression, economic
adventures or financial experimen
tation.
