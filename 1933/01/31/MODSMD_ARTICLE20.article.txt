# Carr Scores Autoists For Non-Appearances
## 
### 
Traffic violators who do not ap
pear before the Men's Council at
the appointed time will be fined $1
in addition to their original penalty,
according to Gil Carr, chairman of
this organization. This ruling has
been on the books for some time bul
has never been strictly enforced.
Numerous failures to appear have
made this action necessary.
Those receiving tickets for park
ing violations and other offenses
must attend the council meeting or
have a representative present. There
have been more violations than
usual in the past two weeks. Cars
parked in front of the Chemistry
Building, Daily office, and Toyon
Hall received the most tickets.
