# No Breadlines In Russia; Jobs Wait College Men

Solution for the depression: If you
can't get a job in capitalistic Amer
ica, go to communistic Russia.
This from an ex-rough, Alan
Kinkead, who writes from Moscow
to his brother Donald Kinkead, '33,
that jobs are available for trained
college grads. He writes: "If you
can't get anything to do after you
get out of school, why not plan to
come over here. Everybody is busy
here. We can find you a job, but tell
us ahead of time so we can arrange
for a passport. Finding a job here is
a cinch compared to getting into the
country."
Alan Kinkead is working as a
chemist and machinist. He says, "It
is just the kind of a job I have
dreamed about but never thought
possible to get at the start. Each
day I find new machines that 1
haven't heard of before. The lab is
far better equipped than any I have

r seen In the United States, including
Stanford.
"Part of the day I spend in re
search work with the chief, an
amiable Russian. This is a new type
of work with chromium and molyb
denum. I also spend part of my time
nitriding. I have several assistants
for this job.
"We earn plenty of rubles 1o live
comfortably on. You can live and
learn here as well as in the United
States. In fact, far better because
you can get better jobs here. It is
easy to get along well with the Rus
sians. Also, there is a darn good
library here in Moscow with all the
papers and magazines from America.
"As far as I can see the Russians
are just as advanced as we are. They
are carrying on more advanced re
search work, I believe, than any
other country except Germany.
Building is going on everywhere.
Factories are going full blast."
