# Gael Debaters Face Yearlings
## 
### 
"Resolved, That the United Stales
should agree to the cancellation of
the inter-allied war debts" is the
question which six feverish fresh
men from Stanford and from St.
Mary's will banter about tomorrow
night in the first debate of the win
ter quarter.
For Stanford: Sam J. Anderson,
Arthur Lundin; and Max Grucnberg.
For St. Mary's: a mystery team. For
God and Country: the audience,
which will perform the function of
judge and critic. Before the debate
the audience will vote on their senti
ments on the question. After the en
counter the audience will vote on
the logic of the question. The Wo
men's Clubhouse.
