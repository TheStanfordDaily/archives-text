# Swift Senate Action May Push Beer Bill Passage
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (A*)
Speedy action such as the Senate
seldom sees, tonight had given the
Collier-Blaine bill to legalize 3.05
per cent beer and wine a chance
just a chanceâ€”of passage at this
session.
The speed was put on in the
Finance Committee, which trampled
over the announced intention of its
chairman, Reed Smoot of Utah, to
give dry leaders extended hearings
on the bill's general merits.
