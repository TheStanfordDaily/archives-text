# ADDRESS-THE ANSWER MAN
## 
### 
The cli mice of a lifetime for Stanford students to find
oul what's what about their I Diversity, from one who
knows. That is what Opportunity, the well-known knocker,
offers ;if tomorrow morning's assembly.
If yon wiinl to know why your room-rent is so high,
why the tuition rate isn't lowered, why I'nion milkshakes
are fifteen cents, Comptroller Roth will tell you. If you
are curious to know the administrative attitude toward any
of a hundred subjects which involve the expenditure of
your money or the t Diversity's, all you have to do is to
pul the question to the comptroller.
In order to facilitate replying to student queries, Roth
is desirous of receiving questions before the time of the
assembly. So if you have one of those burning questions
regarding Stanford finance with a "who knows" answer,
just write it out and hand it to the comptroller, and he'll
tell the world tomorrow. If your questions are not so urg
ent as to prompt individual initiative, then come to the as
sembly anyway, and Roth will most likely answer your
questions for somebody else. And if, on the other hand,
you accept tilings as they are, never questioning, never
doubling, then the comptroller will most likely tell you
lots of interesting things about the operation of a great
universi Iv.
