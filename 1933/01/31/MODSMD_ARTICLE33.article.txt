from the editorial office of the Stanford (lhapurral lias j
come an idea. It's not the first idea the Old Boy has had,
nor is it particularly sensational, hut the Ancient One's
cogitations have turned out an idea which is basically
sound and which, if effective, would remedy an evil. That
is the prime requisite for an editorial idea that it remedy
.-in evil or suggest that somebody else do it.
The (.!mpurral brain-child referred to is, of course, its 1
recent suggestion for a change in the student managerial!
system for varsity sports. The Old Hoy put his finger on the!
very sorest spot with his first poke when he pointed out]
that the system is all wrong in its trvout phases "with the
poor heelers working for two years and then having
nothing to show for it unless they happen to crash through
with a senior managership . . . ."
Consider the poor managerial tryoufee. lie starts toj
work as a sophomore, and at the end of his year he is for-!
lunate enough to he appointed one of several junior man
agers. Then he works another entire year, perhaps only to j
see some other fellow get the senior appointment. And for
those six quarters of work (or nine, if he is lucky), he getsj
exactly two units of I'niversity credit.
The athletes for whom he collects towels, etc., get all;
the "gravy,"* so far as I'niversity recognition is concerned.!
The ('.hapavruVs proposed remedy only one year of fry-i
out, one junior manager, and one senior manager appears!
to be a good one.
('.lmp/tie got the editorial idea, pointed out the evil, and
suggested the remedy. Something should he done about it.;
The Daii.v regretfully announces this morning the re-1
signation of Sheridan Hegland, night editor. Intrinsically a
loss, his resignation is at this time more regrettable because |
he leaves the staff just as he was on the eve of scaling
greater heights on the masthead, the more ironic because!
it was necessitated by the demands of graduate study in
economics. Hegland will be remembered by the Daily asi
a good fellow, a good journalist, and a pot-pusher at staff
poker sessions (the wolf).
