# BULL SESSION
## FEATHERS FOR CHAIRMEN 
### 
If there is one word that Ls 100
per cent anthema to chairmen of
dance committees, it is "simplicity."
They shudder at the idea. It posi
tively lays them low in sheer horror.
Bigger and betier is their aim and
"biggest and best" reads their pub
licity. That is why they grab at '
anything that will put a feather in
their cap. The fact that the feather
costs a lot and is often a bedraggled
mess matters not.
That is why campus orchestras are
often passed up for some bunch of
unemployed tooters who do not have
the rare privilege of waiting for ser
vice in our Union. Now, waiting for
Union service is no claim to especial
fame (getting service might be) — !
but where local musicians are just
about as good as the foreign-grown
variety, why not give the boys a
break?
When the time comes for some
charity work, the local drummers j
are on hand. They are supposed to ;
step up and drum for the joy of
drumming. Personally, I would like |
nothing better than opportunity to
get my fingers wrapped around some
sticks of wood and go to it. Musi
cians, however, crave remuneration.
When a benefit jolly-up is to be
given, Billy Bunn and his Rhythm
Rascals will be far away in the land
where (here is no such thing as free j
music.
But the local boys will slill be i
hanging around and will be asked j
to perform. But why should they? j
They may get the publicity. Their

• music becomes popular with the
campus. But it doesn't become popu
lar with dance chairmen seeking to
wring feathers from roughs' empty
pockets and plume themselves with
those feathers. And so the local
drummers polish their drums for
nothing. They don't get the jobs.
Very often, the only thing that is
imported is a leader and a few of
his cronies from the office of the
Musicians' Union. But that matters
not. They knock off a fancy price.
The chairman is satisfied. He is fa
mous. And if he loses money all is
still well for he doesn't have to pay
for it. It might be a good idea to
make dance chairmen liable for their
dance deficits. It might serve (o
check their splurging ways.
Nothing is more amusing than the
gallant, open-handed way in which
these dance chairmen delight in
spending Other People's Money.
They shun pettyness in every re-
I gard. It's easy to be opulent on the
organization's bank book. And no
one is more grandiosely opulent than
j a dance chairman.
There is plenty of good music on
the campus—at least there is plenty
as good or almost as good as that
which is imported under fancy la
bels. The campus generally is
pleased with their bleatings. Even
i if they weren't so good, they deserve
I the work for their gratis and almost
gratis services at charity functions.
I have heard of "feathering" par
' ties. I now move to de-feather dance
| chairmen. —Abe Mellinkoff
