WILD PILGRIMAGE — By Lynd
Ward. (At (he Stanford Bookstore)
Characteristically done, Lynd '
Ward's latest novel in woodcuts |
proves again that conscious propa- |
ganda is seldom art. The plot differs !
a little from the usual run of wood- j
cut novels, dealing this time with J
the struggles of a laborer born under |
the tyranny of machines. The title!
is chosen from some lines by Arturo j
Giovannitti, poet of the oppressed '
classes.
Ward has changed his technique
in that he now uses a five- or six
grooved tool to cut his lines, and I
two colors of ink: red for the psych
ological phases and black for the
material struggles. He still tends to
do pictures of men falling from high
and lonely cliffs, and his sombre
canyon streets are also present.
The six-grooved chisel, very ef
fectively used in some German lead
cut novels, gets a bit out of control,
giving a weak effect, though some of
the fugitive scenes are made much
more subtle by its use. More theatri
cal and artly than honestly interpre
tive, he uses too much mysterious
lighting and too many trick angles,
on his pictures to be convincing,
The blocks are all beautifully de
signed. The trickery is unfortunate
for one feels that with a little bit
deeper and less artificial feeling for
his art Lynd Ward could say the
same things and achieve something '
really fine. —Williams
THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS—
(Paramount). At the Stanford
Theatre.
As a horror film this is infinitely
better sustained than, for instance,
"White Zombie." In the latter, ma
terial more horrible because it was
more believable after Seabrook's
Magic Island, was misused by over
melodramatic and unoriginal script !
treatment and Ihe film was badly
afted and directed.
The novel from which this film
was made was nonsense, but han
dled skillfully by scenarists Walde
mar Young and Philip Wylie, imagi
natively directed, and acted by the

! admirable Charles Laughton—who is
: in danger of being type cast as a
' mere horrifying menace—and an
| adequate supporting cast, it comes
I well toward the top of a long and
| aging list of gruesome thrillers.
Laughton's dignity and the super

iority of his acidly witty speech
strangely divides audience sym
pathy. His death by forcep is almost
disappointing. —Sandoe
