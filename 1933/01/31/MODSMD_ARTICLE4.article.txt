# BRAILSFORD TO TALK ON DEBTS
## Editor Lectures In Little Theatre Tonight 
### 
Distinguished British editor and
speaker Henry Noel Brailsford will
lecture tonight at 7:30 o'clock to the
Stanford Assembly Hall audience on
"Strangled by Usury: The World's
Problem of Debt."
Brailsford, who for four years was
editor of the European political
commentator, "The New Leader,"
received the following notice in "The
Nation" when he visited America
five years ago:
"Henry Noel Brailsford is an odd
recruit in the army of English lec
turers. He despises bunk; he does
not soft-soap his own empire; he
dares to criticize his own party. His
editorship of the 'New Leader' made
it a force in international thinking
in three continents; and his realistic
analysis of post-war Europe has
been a force of sanity."
Once a member of the Greek For
eign Legion, once British representa
tive on a peace commission in the
Balkan States, Brailsford is the au
thor of: "The War of Steel and
Gold," "A League of Nations" (pub
lished before the organization of the
present League), and "Olives of
Endless Age." The three books pre
sent a plea for peace and arbitra
tion.
