"BELGRADE—A great conference
of the heads of the Macedonian Mos
lem organization at Kosovska has
decided to make a cut of over 75
per cent in the cost of wives."—
Stanford Daily.
The youths of Kosovska
Just starting in life
Do not now face bankruptcy
Just for a wife.
The prices were once up
So high as to scare 'em—
Rut now they can easily
Furnish a harem.

DISCORD
"The profile of Mary Miles Min
ter, former film star, set before a
new scientific sound producing ser
vice, is said to give forth a perfect
major music chord. Perfect profiles,
it is said, give off sweet music."—
S.F. Call-Bulletin.
But hark to the tale of our Lizzie,
The cook who prepares us our
board.
Her face on the now scientific
device
Gave forth a most minor key
chord.
She married a bulky policeman,
A man with a pugilist's pan.
His map, when recorded, made
such a great noise
The kids in the neighborhood ran.
