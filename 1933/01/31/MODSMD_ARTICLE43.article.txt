# Santa Clara Frosh May Upset Indian Yearlings Tonight
## INDIAN HOOPSTERS MAY TRY TO TAKE BRONCS IN STRIDE Only St. Mary's Loss Mars Excellent Santa Clara Season Record 
### 
With one eye on the second game
of the Little Big Scries Saturday
night, the Stanford yearlings take
on an even stronger team than Cali
fornia tonight- the Santa Clara
freshmen.
Jimmy Bradshaw's men are still a
bit puffed up about their victory
over Stockton High last Saturday.
Now they're turning their attention
to California's Bear Cubs. They will
attempt to take Santa Clara in stride
tonight, and this factor, plus the
superior record of the baby Broncos,
points to a Stanford defeat.
Beaten Once
Unbeaten until just a few days
ago, when they were beaten by St.
Mary's, 2.'S-22, Santa Clara's fresh
men boast the most impressive rec
ord of any yearling team in North
ern California.
Santa Clara defeated Lowell High
23-14; Stanford beat the Cardinals
29-23. The Indians just nosed out
Balboa High, while the Broncos
whipped the Buccaneers, 37-17. In
two other games, Santa Clara
showed exceptional scoring power,
defeating College Hill and Lake
Merrill athletic clubs by large mar
gins. Santa Clara fans credit the St.
Mary's defeat to overconfidence.
Star Loses Eye
Stockton's defeat Saturday night
would have been far more decisive
had Ralph Mannion been shooting
with the same uncanny accuracy
that marked his preliminary season
performances. Like varsity scorer
Cordry, the brilliant yearling for
ward seems to have lost his eye,
temporarily at least.
Much of Mannion's ineffectiveness
in the Stockton game may be cred
ited to the close guarding of the
Tarzans. They had been warned of
Mannion's deadly ability at long
range shooting, and refused to let
the lanky Stanford forward get set
for his shots.
