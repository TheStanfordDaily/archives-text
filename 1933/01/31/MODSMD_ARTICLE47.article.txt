IUHILE the campus, sloshes about in the rain, all agog anent an impending
early boating season on Lagunita, the possibilities of soaring with a
wild whoop out of the cold depths of the basketball cellar, the boxing show
coming up on Thursday, and the ragged ruggedness of ruggers, it might
be well to sneak a moment's glance at "Dink" Templeton's track team
coming over the horizon.

INHERE is many an "if" connected to this 1933 track team, and in
all fairness to everyone concerned, it is too early to burden and
embarrass the boys by plastering the early-season label of "great"
on them. Nevertheless, if we are to have a great year, this must
be the one. Cast your eye over the graduating class this year and
cogitate on the loss of "Blazin' Ben" Eastman, Les Hables, Bill
Miller, Ilorc La Borde, Nellie Gray, Jim Ferrie, et al. All splendid
competitors, and point-winners.
. . i . ... <$ • *
DUT don't turn on the weeps too suddenly. All of these aforementioned
men are in their prime this season and along with them there is a lot
of strength. Bud Deacon, for instance, a right smart pole-vaulter, good
for points any day in that event and, what's more, he is rapidly developing
into a formidable man with the javelin. Gus Meier, for instance, who
should be the foremost hurdler on the coast, although his teammate, Cotto
Herbert is pressing him harder every day. And don't forget Dave Packard,
the lad who as a frosh was the best prospect in the hurdles seen in these
parts for years. Packard is really working now and has the ability to
blossom into the nation's best. Morentin, Amdahl, Azevedo, Dave Brown—
don't forget these lads, for they'll be in there at the finish.
permitting, Coach Harry Wolter will bring his Stan
ford varsity baseball team out for the first time tomorrow after
noon for a game with the Kenealy Seals, a San Francisco semi-pro
outfit that has always given the Cardinal nine a good test.
II7OLTER will probably make the most of the opportunity to see how his
candidates perform under fire. He is particularly anxious to get a good
man at second base and in two of the outfield positions. —F.K.H.
