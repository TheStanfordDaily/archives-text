# INDIAN AND ATHENS CLUB WATER POLO TEAMS MEET IN OAKLAND TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford and Athens Club meet
tomorrow night in a water polo game
at Oakland which will decide the
leadership of the Northern Califor
nia Water Polo League.
Both teams won their opening
games of the first-round competi- â€¢
tion, Stanford defeating the Olympic !
Club last Saturday, 8-4, while the
Athens Club downed California, 9-4.
Dubbed "the greatest water polo
team in Stanford history," the In
dian squad disappointed many by its 1

! showing against the Post Street
players. Stanford's scoring machine
looked brilliant at times, but de
fensive play was sub-par. The Olym
pic Club scored two of its field goals
; in rapid succession. A bright spot in
, the Indian showing was the stellar
play of Leo Cook, substitute goal
guard, who made many spectacular
stops of Olympian scoring thrusts.
A 103-piece band has been organ
' ized at South Dakota State.
