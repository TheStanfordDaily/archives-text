# BERKELEY SHIES AT CARD RUGBY SQUAD CHALLENGE
## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
While Norman Cleaveland of the
Stanford Rugby Club journeyed to
Berkeley with the object of stirring
up interest in a proposed contest
between that Stanford squad and
some organization from the Univer
sity of California, reports from the
Daily Californian indicated little en
thusiasm for the project.
Insufficient preparation is the rea
son given unofficially as the objec
tion of the Californians. They feel
that the Stanford team is too far
advanced in the ancient and honor-

able art of scumming it up.
Cleaveland carried with him a
challenge drawn up and signed by
members of the team, headed by
Bill Sim as acting captain.
Although the Californians decline
to engage in the contest at present,
there is an optimistic feeling that
such a game may be arranged at a
later date. If played, it would un
doubtedly draw as large a gate as
last Saturday's attraction, which
cleared over §400 for the benefit of
the student employment relief fund.
