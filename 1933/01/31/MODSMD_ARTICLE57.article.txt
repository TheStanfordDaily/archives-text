### 
PULLMAN, Wash, Jan. 30 (PIP)
â€”Will Rogers, the cowboy humorist,
whose daily column is a feature of
many newspapers, is willing to de
bate Dr. Claudius O. Johnson, of the
Washington State College political
science department, who challenged
Rogers' ability as an authority on
world affairs.
The debate, if Will can arrange it,
will be held in Seattle or Spokane;
the proceeds to go to charity. Rogers
also called on Professor Dummeier
to prove the asserted statement of
the journalist that "we loaned them
all the money and they never spent
a cent with us." If Will ever said
this, he stated that he would eat the
New York telephone directory.
