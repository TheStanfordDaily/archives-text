a case involving seepage of gas from
a helium plant. Ralph Lui and Dan
iel Bryant were attorneys for the
plaintiff in the cas?.
The mythical case contended that
in allowing the gas to escape, the
defendants had injured the plain
tiff's herd of cows, pastured in an
adjacent field. Moore and Ryan de
clared that a national need for the
product of the helium plant existed,
and compared the size of the de
fendant's investment with the small

position of the defendants would be
