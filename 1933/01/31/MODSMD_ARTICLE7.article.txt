PARIS, Jan. 30 (/P) â€” Edouard
Daladier, negotiating with the So
cialist party for participation in the
cabinet he is trying to form, ob
tained an offer of co-operation, but
with conditions which his friends
doubted he would accept.

Their offer to participate was on
condition that he accept a program
calling for State ownership of the
railroads, reduction in the military
appropriation, and certain Socialist
doctrines.
