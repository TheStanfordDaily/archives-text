# Thirsty Lagunita Drinks 10,000,000 Gallons Daily
## 
### ROBERT MYNARD 
Nearly 70,000,000 gallons of San
Francisquito's cold and muddy water
now lies in Lagunita's basinâ€”await
ing the additional 37,000,000 gallons
that will make the Farm's big pud
dle a real lake. A marshy meadow
has been converted into a lake bot
tom in less weeks.
As the water races through the
ditch from the diversion dam on
San Francisquito to Roble's back
yard lagoon at the rate of approxi
mately 10,000,000 gallons every 24
hours, the millions of gallons al
ready arrived are dropping their
cargoes of silt and preparing for th<_>

balmy April and May days when ro
mance and sheer indolence will ride
(he Lagunita waves.
And it's all possible because the
storms that have visited the Pacific
Coast since January 15 have dropped
4.23 inches of rain on the campus
and a great many more inches of
rain and snow on the Coast Range
peaks and ridges.
Stanford's other reservoirs have
profited, too. Searsville, with 263,-
000,000 gallons to its credit, is splash
ing a surplus over the spillways.
Felt lake is more than half full, its
earthen dam now impounding 177,-
000,000 gallons.
