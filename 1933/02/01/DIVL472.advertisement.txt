Looking for Values?
THEN
Read the Daily Ads!
Did you every stop to think why business
firms advertise in the STANFORD DAILY?
Do they advertise in order to help the paper
—to give printers jobs—to amuse themselves?
No, they advertise in the DAILY because
they have a definite message for you—you and
some four thousand other DAILY readers.
They have unusual values in quality merchan
dise which they believe will win your approval.
/ They use this means to tell you of these values.
True, the business firms do gain by their
advertising—but so do you. Only by reading
the ads can you keep in touch with the latest
styles; the newest products; and the most rea
sonable prices. "You can rely on it if it's ad
f vcrtised."
