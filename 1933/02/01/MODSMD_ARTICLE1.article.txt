# INDIAN CAGERS BEAT BRONCOS IN HARD GAME
## Topping Is High Point Man For Third Successive Contest With 14 STANDS FAIL TO BOO Santa Clara Leads At Half As Nicholas Stars 
### Dick Strouse 
Before the hushed silence of a
polite crowd that was either too ex
hausted or too wise from the
U.C.L.A. series to cheer, Stanford's
basketball team staved off a last
minute Santa Clara rush to defeat
the Broncos 27 to 25 last night in
the Pavilion.
Starting as usual with a large
goose-egg on the scoreboard for the
first minutes of the game, the Cards
finally broke their customary fust
half lethargy when John Hancock
calmlu tossed in a free throw. Santa
Clara's 8 to 1 lead at that time was
reduced to 14 to 8 at half-time, and
the Indians came back after their
rest to register 17 points while the
Broncs made exactly 5.
Rally That Failed
With the score 27 to 19 against
them, Santa Clara's final rally fell
just two points short of tieing up
the game. In those first fifteen min
utes of the second half and until Hal
Edelen went out on four personals,
Stanford looked like a well-oiled,
well-directed basketball machine:
the rest of the game was fun to
watch.
Keith Topping, who spends his
evenings breaking for the basket
and then tapping Edelen's and Cap
tain Codry's pusses through the
hoop, as usual led the Stanford
scorers. Keith recorded 14 points for
the third successive game, and his
work last night (in spite of a bit
of he-man rough stuff) showed why
Topping is tied for third among
Coast Csnference scorers.
Hancock Smiles, Shines
John Hancock broke his custom
ary mask to smile last night, and
apparently he is an optimist at heart,
as he played the best game of his
life, Outstanding for Santa Clara
were Jimmie Nicholas, who tallied
three field goals until ho was in
jured late in the first half, Frank
Sobrero, whose five points were in
strumental in the final Bronc rally,
and a lean little guard named Pesco.
Both teams seemed to be color
blind in the first half, as the red
shirted Indians passed to the white
garbed Broncs and vice versa. In
fact, all previous records for incom
plete passes were shattered in that
period. But there was some real
basketball played in the last twenty
minutes, and Stanford's working of
the ball was good.
