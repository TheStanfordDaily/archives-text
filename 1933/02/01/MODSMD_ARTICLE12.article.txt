# Savants Of 18th Century Approved Joy-Ride Dates
## 
### SILVIA ANN COWELL 
Joy-riding was highly approved
by such 18th century sages as Dr.
Samuel Johnson and Benjamin
Franklin, as it is by modern col
legians.
It is comforting for Stanfordites
to know that they are not particu
larly depraved because they like to
"car" around in the hills on bright
nights.
According to Boswell, his friend
and ardent admirer, Johnson re
marked strongly one day, "If I had
no duties, and no reference to fu
turity, I would spend my life in
driving briskly in a post-chaise with
a pretty woman; but she should be
one who could understand me, and
would add something to the con
versation."
That Johnson was no mere idler is
proved by the fact that, unaided, he

' compiled the first dictionary of the J
English language, besides tackling
many other literary jobs.
Benjamin Franklin, while Ameri- j
can ambassador in Paris, used to j
delight in driving in coaches with i
beautiful ladies.
"Buggy 'riding" was Johnson's |
recreation after mighty literary ef- j
forts. Ben Franklin used it as an j
antidote for gout brought on by |
diplomatic labors (and stuffing ban
quets). Students indulge in it after
arduous scribblings of econ papers.
Whether the transportation be by
horse and buggy, or by eight-cylin
der roadster, and whether the com
pany be a powdered-wigged dame,
or a trimly cropped modern miss,
joy-riding is ever fun.
Kindly refer disapproving elders
to Johnson's emphatic remark.
