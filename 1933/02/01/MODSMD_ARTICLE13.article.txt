# WORLD ECON GIVEN COLOR BY BRITISHER
## Henry Brailsford Hammers Hearst Propaganda On "Buy American" 
### 
Indicating the Hearstian contra
diction of "Pay Up Your Debts" as
opposed to "Buy American," blue
shirted, big-headed Britisher Henry
Noel Brailsford last night presented
a vivid picture of the woi'ld's plight
in his lecture, "Strangled by Usury:
The World's Problem of Debt."
Brailsford hammered away at his
thesis: A creditor nation must ex
pect an excess of imports over ex
ports if debtors are to pay up.
Britain Debtor
In clear, forceful language the
speaker pointed out the parallel be
tween pre-War Britain and post-
War America. Before the war, John
Bull was the world's banker, and
was forced to accept an unfavorable
balance of trade in order that credi
tors might pay interest on loans.
Today, Uncle Sam has slipped the
Englishman's boots. Said Brails
ford: "The nation cannot accept thus
change without accepting a change
in its domestic housekeeping."
Buy Up Planet?
But Brailsford is interested in
more than just the present war debt
enigma, for, he said, a country like
the United States has owing her a
private debt which at least equals
the war debt sum of eleven billions
of dollars.
Smiled Brailsford: "Of course, we
may gradually buy up the planet,
but what then?" We will have our
finger in the world's pie, but then
we will have saddled ourselves with
unlimited responsibility, and a re
volt of Europe is likely.
