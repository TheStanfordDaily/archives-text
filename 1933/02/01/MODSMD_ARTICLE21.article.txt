# Frosh Pull Ancient Trick, Put Ford In Wrong Pew
## 
### 
In the good old days they used to
push them up the stairs to the fourth
floor, but now they drag them away
from Encina over to the arcade in
front of the Administration Build
ing and park them.
It's a new-fangled Farm trick on
the- long-suffering Fordâ€”not quite
as spectacular as in the G.O.D. but
indicative of the existence of an
Undying tradition.
