# ALL-UNIVERSITY QUERY MEETING TO HEAR ROTH
## Comptroller To Give Facts And Figures In Reply To Questions CORBUS WILL PRESIDE Financial Distribution Big Issue In Answers 
### 
WHAT'S WHAT about Stanford!
Speaking at an All-University As
sembly at 10 o'clock this morning,
Comptroller Almon E. Roth will dis
cuss pertinent questions asked by
students about the administration of
Stanford.
Arranged at the request of
A.S.S.U. officials, the assembly, to
be presided over by Bill Corbus,
Stanford's All-American guard stu
dent-body president, is designed l<>
bring the administration in closer
contact with Farm students. Roth,
by virtue of his position as Comp
troller of the University, is better
acquainted with financial affairs of
the Stanford foundation than any
other person connected with the in
stitution.
Questions Submitted
Inquiries submitted by students
through the Daily have been de
livered to Roth who will select those
of current interest for his talk today.
Perhaps the most persistent ques
tion asked of University officials at
present is"How and to what extent
does the depression affect Stanford
funds?" Roth will be prepared to
give the actual facts and figures as
found by his office. Closely con
nected with this question is the one,
"Is it possible for Stanford to re
duce tuition fess in view of the cur
rent economic depression?" This is
one of the queries that have been
received at the Daily office.
Dining Hall Prices
Roth has promised to answer the
perennial inquiry in regard to the
Union prices. "Why is it unfair to
compare Union and Encina Dining
Hall prices with the prices of Palo
Alto establishments?" Another pres
ent-day campus problem is the one
of housing. Roth recently addressed
a group of junior transfer students
on this subject, so he will be pre
pared to speak authoritatively.
Other questions submitted to lioth
are:
How are the student unemploy
ment funds being expended?
Where does the $14 of the quar
terly fees go?
What is the extent of the Stan
ford campus?
What is the comparative rank ol
Stanford scholarship funds?
