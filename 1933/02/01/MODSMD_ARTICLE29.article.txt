# TODAY'S ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
Why Stanford is thought by outsiders to have unlimited
wealth. Whv the Brainier dining hall is not being used.
Whv there are three independ(;nl eating clubs. All the facts
will be explained bv Comptroller Roth in this morning's
assembly. However, he does not feel able to explain the
depression, or to predict when there will be a return to
prosperily!
It has been six years since Stanford students have heard
about the inner workings of the l T niversitv. A lot of gripes
and unnecessary criticism would be saved if an assembly
of this kind were held every two years. Every student
should make a point of going today so that he will fully
understand the administration's point of view.
A good many people will be surprised by the simplicity
of the explanations of problems that appeared unanswer
able to the outsider. The Administration wants the student
to feel that it is his Stanford as much as anyone's.
It's funny how different things look when you're gazing
out, instead of trying to peek in.
