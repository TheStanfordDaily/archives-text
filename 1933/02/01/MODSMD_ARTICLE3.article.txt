# SELL-OUT SEEN IN TICKET SALE
## New Low "Holiday" Prices Spur Early Buying 
### 
Headed for a virtual sell-out, the
| ticket sale for Friday's performance
; of "Holiday" continues today in the
j Old Union and at Keeble's in Palo
| Alto.
Surprising the most sophisticated,
j baffling the most blase, the most
; astute, the ticket sale scaled new
; heights with its materially reduced
i scale of prices. There are, however,
| some excellent locations remaining,
j at $1 for choice seats on the main
! floor, and 75 cents for the side seats,
• and the same price for center bal
j cony.
Jones Heads Cast
The cast is headed by Marian
; Jones, who enacts the part of Linda
! Seton, rebellious daughter of the
1 wealthy Seton family. It is her re-
I bellion against the family's rever
! ence for riches that provides the
I basis of the plot.
Johnny Case, played by Jimmy
| Benet, is the hero, a hard-working,
! attractive chap who wants his holi
| day while he is still young—an idea
; which prevents his marriage with
! Julia Seton, played by Mary Anita
j Loos.
Other Players
Edward Seton, "financier and co-
I tillion-leader," is played by Joseph
Wolf, who was so outstanding in
] "Death Takes A Holiday." His son
i Ned is played by John Peckham.
Nick and Susan Potter are played
by Bob Churchill and Elizabeth

provide most of the fun of the play,
especially in the Now Year's Eve
party of the second act.

the brunt of the Potters' jests, and
I these two are played by Eleanor
Furst and Carter Meyer.
