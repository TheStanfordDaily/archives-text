# AN INEXPENSIVE "HOLIDAY"
## 
### 
Marrams have certainly come to ho the rule in campus
undergraduate activities. This play in the Assembly Hall
Friday night promises to he one of the host bargains of the
year, following yesterday's announcement that top seats
will sell for a more dollar, with the remainder of the or
chestra priced at seventy-live cents.
There are lots of advertising slogans which the Dra
matic Council might steal these days. One of the most apt
would ho somebody or other's "the prices get lower and
lower, but the quality gels higher and higher." That's un
doubtedly the situation. Xover before have the Dramatic
Council and Director Hclvenston ottered a more entertain
ing series of dramatic productions than this season. Of this
series, the forthcoming production of "Holiday" promises
lo bo the most suited to Stanford tastes, therefore the most
entertaining of all.
The Dramatic Council, it appears, has weathered the
drouth of depression, in giving the campus more nearly
what it wants at prices it is more easily able to pay.
