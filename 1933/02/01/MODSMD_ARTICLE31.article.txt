Kilhor the press has misrepresented goings on at Har
vard I 'Diversity, or the students of the effete east have suf
fered a horrible let-dowD from their usual sedate attitude.
A director of dining halls there has announced, so press
dispatches said, that he is arranging to serve beer in the
(lining halls when, and if, beer is legalized.
Now the first surprise is in the revelation that Harvard
men drink beer, a beverage that is usually thought of in
connection with men that are rough and ready, or fat and
lazy. The second shock is that Harvard's elite should find
anything alluring in the prospect of drinking boor with
meals. The results of mixing food and the yeasty beverage
may not be so disastrous as mixing alcohol and gasoline,
but nevertheless often there are results
Of course, the picture that might bo drawn of a Harvard
dining hall at dinner time, with beer as the main course, is
somewhat dimmed by presence of the 15.2 per cent clause
in the bill now in congress.
