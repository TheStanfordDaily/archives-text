# BULL SESSION
## THE 						NATTY NAZI NEGOTIATES 
### 
From corporal to soap-box to
Chancellor reads the life-story of
Adolph Hitler. Capitalizing on the
terrific discontent, Hitler advertised
plenty, watered his stock, and has
now been able to land himself as
head of the German Republic.
Whether he will be able to pay divi
dends after he has finally organized
his company is another question.
Most people say "No."
Germany r lost the War and hasn't
been allowed to forget that fact ever
since. That rankles them, naturally—
especially the young generation. The
depression has made matters worse.
Germany is an industrial nation and
what a beating industry has taken.
It is said that in a depression, the
closer to the ground a nation lives,
[he belter. Mexico as a result doesn't
feel the depression.
But Germany until recently sad
dled with reparations and even now
shackled to the depression of course,
was in a bad way. Hitler was to
sure all. Now he has the power—in
name anyway. He has to produce or
pop goes Hitler. The pop is expected
very shortly. Hitler is like Mus
solini in that they both talk. Mus
solini, however, is a builder. Those
that know say that Hitler can con
struct nothing but promises and
manifestos.

Germans want an army—a real
army. They want one that can whip
the Poles, Czechs, and of course the
wine-sippers across the Rhine. But
the Versailles Treaty says "No."
Hitler says "Yes." What will France
do if Hitler rearms Germany? Some
years back when German violated
the Treaty, France moved in with
her army.
France would never do that now.
She probably would be afraid. Yet
if Germany sets the precedent of
violating the Treaty, what next? It's
too gooey to think about. One thing,
the depression will probably make
; war impossible. French and Ameri
i can gold can probably maintain
peace.
Germany wants equality with
France which can be had by France
disarming or Germany rearming.
With the horrible economic mess in
which everyone now is, the answer
seems very simple and clear to us
'way over here. But it. doesn't seem
clear at all to Paris or Berlin. The
Ruhr and the Marne are not merely
geographical locations to these peo
ples.
The dashing black-beauty of Ger
man politics has won the race. But
can he keep the pace? Better yet, if
he can keep up the pace, what will
be the result? —Abe MellinkolT

From corporal to soap-box to
Chancellor reads the life-story of
Adolph Hitler. Capitalizing on the
terrific discontent, Hitler advertised
plenty, watered his stock, and has
now been able to land himself as
head of the German Republic.
Whether he will be able to pay divi
dends after he has finally organized
his company is another question.
Most people say "No."
Germany r lost the War and hasn't
been allowed to forget that fact ever
since. That rankles them, naturally—
especially the young generation. The
depression has made matters worse.
Germany is an industrial nation and
what a beating industry has taken.
It is said that in a depression, the
closer to the ground a nation lives,
[he belter. Mexico as a result doesn't
feel the depression.
But Germany until recently sad
dled with reparations and even now
shackled to the depression of course,
was in a bad way. Hitler was to
sure all. Now he has the power—in
name anyway. He has to produce or
pop goes Hitler. The pop is expected
very shortly. Hitler is like Mus
solini in that they both talk. Mus
solini, however, is a builder. Those
that know say that Hitler can con
struct nothing but promises and
manifestos.

Germans want an army—a real
army. They want one that can whip
the Poles, Czechs, and of course the
wine-sippers across the Rhine. But
the Versailles Treaty says "No."
Hitler says "Yes." What will France
do if Hitler rearms Germany? Some
years back when German violated
the Treaty, France moved in with
her army.
France would never do that now.
She probably would be afraid. Yet
if Germany sets the precedent of
violating the Treaty, what next? It's
too gooey to think about. One thing,
the depression will probably make
; war impossible. French and Ameri
i can gold can probably maintain
peace.
