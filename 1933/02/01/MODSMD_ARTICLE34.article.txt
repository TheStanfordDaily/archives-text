THE NARROW CORNER. W. Som
erset Maugham. Doubleday, Doran
Neither better nor worse than
usual, Maugham's latest novel makes
indifferent reading but for the last
part which is episode jammed. It is
flawless in effect before any action
occurs. Maugham, in simple, unac
celerated language, manages superb
ly uncanny atmosphere. When he
finally permits his characters to act
the stage is well set. All. that they
do is, for this reason, especially
vivid. It is a trick of Maugham, the
playwright.
He sets the East Indian scene with
a tramp sailing vessel, manned by
shifty-eyed villains who are mutu
ally distrustful—the appendages of a
crime. Yet; nothing happens and
nothing continues to happen until
almost the close of the narrative.
Undismayed by the fact that his
method is quite obvious, Maugham
fiddles around with description until
the sway-back of his story is ready
to snap and then skillfully effects its
rescue with a betrayal, and a sui
cide, a disillusionment and a murder
to finish with a story you do not
wish to put down and dri not find
easy to forget:—
"Short, therefore, is man's life and
r.&rrow is the corner of the earth
wherein he dwells"—is the introduc
tion and Maugham's way of fore
telling that a cynical English doc
tor of a Chinese city making a lei
surely trip to the.sparsely populated
islands of the East Indies will even
tually have great adventure on one
of the smallest and least populated
and most out of the way.
A fair novel, "The Narrow Cor
ner" contains just the proper num
ber of dramatic mice and puppy
dogs' tails to make a distinguished
cne-act play, but not enough to
make a novel, two-thirds of which
must be introduction, outstanding.

ANOTHER LANGUAGE (Franken)
—At (he Geary Theatre. (The
Curran-Geary management has
seen fit because of the Daily's
policy of sincere criticism to dis
continue critical privileges.)
No brief review can deal ade
quately with this play; on the whole
it is excellent, but the difficulties
arising out of the material, the plot,

and the acting lead to a certain un
even quality and frequently allow
the spectator to realize that he is
seeing only a play.
The whole revolves about the Hal
lam family, middle-class, unintelli
gent, with no sense of values, and
above all, vulgar. Stella has married
into this atmosphere and Jerry was
born into it; both fight against, its
immovable complacency, and in the
end succeed. For the sake of the plot
Jerry is made to fall in love with
his aunt Stella, and while this brings
action to what would otherwise be
only a situation, it causes most of
the improbabilities and hysterical
moments which weaken the play.
But handling material of this sort is
difficult at best, and Rose Franken
has on the whole .succeeded.
The acting was for the most part
excellent, which is no small achieve
ment, since all but two were playing
totally unsympathetic parts. Tom
Powers as Stella's husband stood out
especially, and Ellen Lane's realiz
ing as fcir as was c<fusistent the
comic elements of her part aided
greatly. The key role is that of
Stella, and Laura Straub did not
have the necessary ability to fulfill
its over-exacting demands. Her
voice, though pleasing, was affected,
her pronunciation clear; her lack of
restraint and of knowledge of ges
ture hindered her; and she had not
much idea of characterization. Bui
she has possibilities, and experience
may smooth out these defects.
Credit is due both the scene de
signer and the director; to the for
mer for constructing a set which re
flected perfectly the Hallam atmos
phere, and to the latter for skillful
handling of the large cast and a
complete unity of tone. Though ihe
play is really comedy its criticism
is so severe that the laughter is
hollow. This vivid portrait would be
extremely effective if anyone would
realize that he is in part the object
of the criticism. ■—Zimansky
