FELTON LIBRARY
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial in the January 27th
issue of the Stanford Daily is dis
tinctly pleasing to us in that it indi
cates an interest in the Charlotte
Ashley Felton Memorial Library and
ii desire upon the part of the stu
dents to take advantage of its cul
tural opportunities. The editorial re
ferred to, however, is misleading in
two respects.
There is no obvious reason why
any Stanford student should be un
aware of the existence of the Felton
Library. Articles concerning it have
appeared three times in the Stan
i ford Daily, twice in the Stanford
Illustrated Review three times in
the Report of the President, and
i regularly in the Stanford University
Bulletin. A notice concerning its use
has been posted upon the Library
bulletin board continually during
the last two years. Many classes
have held their meetings in it.
There is absolutely no reason for
advising students not to wear cords
or moleskins. Readers are welcomed
in this room attired in garments
! running in range between overalls
and formal evening attire.
Under existing conditions ii is not
possible for the University to pro
vide the assistants to keep the Char
lotte Ashley Felton Memorial Li
brary open during the same hours
as prevail in the University Library.
The donor is very kindly paying the
salary of a part-time assistant which
enables us to keep the library open
twelve hours a week.
Beginning Monday, January 30th,
the Felton Library will be open eve-
I nings from 8 to 10 o'clock. This will
be an experiment. If the attendance
is sufficient to justify a continuance
of these hours, some way will be
i found to carry on.
It should be understood that: this
! library is not intended hs a browsing

room. It was established for the spe
cific purpose of stimulating research
in the fields of modern American
and English literature. The majority
of books in this collection are of
considerable rarity and must be
used with great care if they are to
be preserved for the future.
Sincerely yours,
Nathan van Patten
Director, University Libraries
