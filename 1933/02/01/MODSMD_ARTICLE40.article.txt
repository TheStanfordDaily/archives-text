"So," said the Old Man With The
Gray Beard, "we paid Warner the
$400 and he agreed to bring his
track team around. Homecoming
day it was, Lafayette University,
1909. Day before the meet I went
down to the train to see our $400
worth of talent.
"Pop got. off with one lone Indian
in tow. They stood around and soon
another pair sauntered up. 'Where's
the team?' I asked Pop.
"He grunted. 'They'll be here.
Let's go eat.'
"I perspired freely. 'Listen, Pop,' I
begged him. 'Four hundred stone i.s
lots of money. We almost had to
mortgage Lafayette University to
raise it and we gotta draw a crowd
to pay for it.' At this time another
pair of Indians strolled up and stood
silently behind Pop. Their coach
grunted and spoke again: 'Boys hun
gry. Let's eat.'
"I was faint by this time. 'Pop,' I
implored him, 'tell me, is THAT the
team?' He grunted again. 'Suve,' he
.said, complacently, 'we only want
to win this meet.'"
The Old Man With The Gray
Beard smiled rominiscently.
"The next afternoon Warner's five
Indians met 42 men from the Lafay
ette track team. Jim Thorpe won
eight first places and took second in
the 100. Two Indians named Ar
quette and Tewanima finished one
two in the half-mile, mile, and two
mile. Shenandoah won the quarter -
mile by almost that far. The fifth
Indian, named Johnson, finished
second in about, everything else. The
Indians won the meet 71 to 31.
"For years,'' concluded the Old
Man With The Gray Beard, "we
staged meets with the Indians. We
never licked them, no matter how
few there were, but once wo tied
them sfi-56. That was just luck,
though."
The 0.M.W.T.G.8. chuckled: "We
would have lost then only an In
dian named Houser refused to throw
the discus. He laid down on the
grass and refused to get up. Even
Pop couldn't budge him.
" 'No, Pop,' said Houser, 'I won't
throw for you today. You haven't
been treating me right lately.'"
