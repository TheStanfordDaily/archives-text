# Card Ball Club In First Game
## 
### 
Having had three games post
poned already, Coach Harry Wolter's
baseball team is still waiting for an
opportunity to open the season
against its annual first-game oppon
ent, the Kenealy Seals.
IF it doesn't rain too much this
morning or 'hasn't rained most of
the night, Wolter will send his 1933
outfit through a nine-inning battle
with the semi-pro and professional
players.
Meanwhile, the conference is in a
turmoil over the reports that both
U.S.F. and U.C.L.A. have dropped
baseball from their spring activities
list. Although nothing has been of
ficially released, and they are both
.still technically on the C.1.8.L.
schedule, there i.s a chance that
Stanford will only have twelve
league games this season should they
withdraw.
