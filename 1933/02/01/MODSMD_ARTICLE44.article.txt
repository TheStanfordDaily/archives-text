# Card Frosh Nose Out Santa Clara Colts 29-27
## PAPOOSE QUINTET STAVES OFF FINAL BRONC SCORE RUSH Santa Clara Yearlings Try To Overcome Half-Time Card Lead 
### Albert Guerard 
Jimmy Bradshaw held tight to his
rabbit's foot last night, and his
freshman basketball players added
Santa Clara's yearlings to their
growing list of victims. The Indians
won 29-27 when a spirited Bronco
rally just fell short of tying the
score.
Don Greenlee, a boy with a nice
face and a big basketball reputation,
cut loose with some fancy shooting,
reminiscent of his prep school days
at Glendale His sixteen points
last night helped a lot.
Greenlee/ Hot
The Broncs couldn't top Green
lee at all during the first half. The
tall Papoose center rang the hoop
with five close-in shots, and a free
throw: 11 points in twenty minutes
of basketball. Half time score was
19-10.
Santa Clara came back for the
second half determined to check
Stanford's brilliant scorer, but
Greenlee refused to be stopped. He
quickly sunk a close in shot which,
followed by Barnett's free throw,
lengthened the Stanford lead to 22-
10. Free throws soon gave Greenlee
and Stanford two points more, nulli
fying Bronco Conroy's long shot. A
free throw by Viguie set the count
at 25-12, A Santa Clara rally tried
to get under way at this point, but
only a field goal and a free throw
by Ethen were successful out of nu
merous luscious openings in the
Stanford defense. The Santa Clarans
were passing well, but were hope
less at setup shots.
Ralph Mannion tried several of
the long shots on which he was
formerly so consistent, but his play
was a sad travesty of the brilliance
he showed in early season games.
Broncs Come Back
Goodcll and Conroy engineered a
fairly successful Bronco comeback
at this point, whittling the Indian
lead to 27-20.
Dave Farber committed his
fourth personal foul, and Gilmore
sunk one of his two shots to bring
the Broncos within six points. Re
placing Farber at guard was Luh
man, seeing his big time competi
tion of the season.
Viguie's free throw stopped the
scare. Seven points looked fairly
secure with only three minutes to
go, but Conroy retaliated with a set
up .shot that made the score 28-23.
Two minutes to go, and Com'oy had
again scored, bringing the Broncs
within three points. Conroy again,
and only one point to go.
Babes Still Ahead
Ralph Mannion's free throw ap
peared gigantic as it gave Stanford
a 29-27 lead. Fifteen seconds later
the game ended.
George Viguie's floor game was
excellent, and his nine points prac
tically made up for the rest of the
Indian total not accounted for by
Greenlee.
