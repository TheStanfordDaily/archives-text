# CARD WATER POLO SQUAD TO TANGLE ATHENS CLUBBERS
## Oakland Outfit Threatens Indian Chance For League Title 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo team
encounters its second hurdle in its
quest for the championship of the
Northern California Water Polo
League when it tangles with the
strong Athens Club septet at Oak
land at 8:30 o'clock tomorrow night.
Little is known of the Oakland
team except that it beat California
9 to 4 and showed good form in
doing so. Austin Clapp, former Stan
ford star, who saw the game, be
lieves that the Athens Club is much
stronger than the Olympic Club,
which was defeated 8 to 4 by Stan
ford Saturday.
Gordon Corson, former University
of Oregon star, is the Athens Club
star and captain. He is supposed to
be a better dribbler than Vlad Tar
anik, the Indians' star in that de
partment. Probably Ted Wiget will
be the only man on the Stanford
team who will be able to outswim
him in the sprints.
Ogden Driggs, star of the 1928
Olympic Games, is another club
threat. He plays consistent polo and
should give the Indians plenty of
trouble.
