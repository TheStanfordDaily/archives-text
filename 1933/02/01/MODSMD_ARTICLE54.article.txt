### 
LONDON, Jan. 31 — The mas
sive gates of Westminster Abbey are
expected to swing open to receive
another of England's immortals.
John Galsworthy today died at his
home in Hampstead from anemia
which followed a severe cold con
tracted a month ago. He was 65
years old.
Friends and relatives initiated a
movement to give his body a final
resting place in Poet's Corner of
Westminster Abbey near the burial
places of Chaucer and Browning.
Galsworthy has been called Eng
land's greatest living novelist and
his plays early received commenda
tion from literatti. 'The Forsyte
Saga" and "The Burning Spear" are
considered his greatest narrations.
As a playwright Galsworthy won

distinction with the dramas, '"Jus
tice" and "The Fugitive."
Throughout his works, literatti
ugree, ran a "broad, genial philo- j
sophy of life enlivened by an acute j
sense of humor and mellowed by a j
restrained sense of ethics."
In November 1932 the aging man ;
of letters was awarded the Nobel j
prize for literature. Ironically, Gals- t
worthy's health had already begun
to fail, and he was unable to make
the trip to Stockholm for the cere- !
mony.
Rudyard Kipling, speaking for !
England, in expressing his condo- j
lences, said the loss of Galsworthy !.
was irreparable. I
