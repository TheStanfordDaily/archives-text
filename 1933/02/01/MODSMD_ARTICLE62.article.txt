# Card Ruggers Hit U.C. Dodge
## 
### 
"A bird for a bird" is the slogan
of the Stanford Rugby Club. When
their proposal of a Stanford-Cali
fornia rugby contest to be played for
student relief was politely parried
by the Californians, who pointed out
that, as U.C. had a clever crew who
were forever getting medals of one
kind or another pinned upon them
selves, it might be a much better
idea to match stroke for stroke, oar
for oar, and shell for shell, the rug
gers came back with a snappy left.
"Loan us coach and equipment for
the crew and we will do the same
for you in rugby. Then we can have
both meetings." This was the essence
ot the Cards retort. "You have great
crews," they continued, "but how
much student relief funds do the
titles account for?"

At the University of Berlin tlu
students are permitted a period ol
six weeks in which to analyze nd
select their professors.
