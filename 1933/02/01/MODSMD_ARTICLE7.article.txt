# MILITARY BALL TO BE REVIVED
## Set Date For February 17; Limit Bids To 200 
### 
Open to all members of the Stan
ford community, the Military Ball
will return to the campus after a
year's absence on Friday, February
17, when Scabbard and Blade re
news the always popular Winter
Quarter formal.
The dance studio of the Women's
Gym has been obtained for the
dance, and Griff Williams' twelve
piece orchestra will furnish the
music. Accompanying the orchestra
I will be singers John McCrea and
Joaquin Garray; the latter is the
Mexican who formerly starred at the
Fox Theatre in San Francisco.
Priccd at $3
John Robb, Captain of Scabbard
and Blade, announces that the bids
will be limited at 200, but that any
one at Stanford may purchase one.
Selling for three dollars—the lowest
price in the history of the Ball—the
bids may be purchased at the
A.S.S.U. office or from any member
of Scabbard and Blade.
The motif of the all-campus dance
is a military one, and among the
many features will be flags draping
ihe walls and guns from the R.O.T.C.
decorating the floor. Two Fx-ench
75's will be on display, and will be
explained by gunnery experts. There
will also be machine guns of the
type used by the United States
army.
Guns on Display
In sympathy with the formality of
the Ball, the programs are of white
leather with a gold crest. Refresh
ments will be served, and the Scab
bard and Blade expects to produce
another of the dances that in former
years rivalled the Senior Ball.
