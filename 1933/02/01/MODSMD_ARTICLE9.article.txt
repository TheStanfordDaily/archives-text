## Royal Cardinals Will Play For Charity Dance On Saturday Night 
### 
California's and Stanford's respec
tive feet are already tapping with
anticipation. Saturday night at 8
o'clock, the Big Game. Immediately
afterward, an inter-university dance
to be held in the Women's Gym.
Only 25 cents for each pair of col
legiate feet accompanied by A.S.S.U.
and A.S.U.C. cards. ■
Substitute the new and greater
Royal Cardinals orchestra, noted for
its slow, appealing tempos, for
Johnny Hamp's or Ted' Fiorito's
bands; a collegiate crowd in* placo
of the motley San Francisco hotel
throng; and 25 cents instead of the
proverbial five-dollar bill—there are
your reasons for slaying on the cam
pus Saturday night. Joe'll be there.
So will Mary.
Trio Featured
Marion Hewlett, chairman of the
gala affair, and her committee, have
been busy working out entertain
ment effects and amusement during
intermissions which will be suited
to enliven feet of the hoarse colle
gians. Between dances, the Royal
Cardinals present a trio, by name
the Three Royal Cards, who will
sing in the patio.
In addition, the possibility of many
of the male sex from Berkeley
trooping over to the gym afterward
to get a taste of Stanford social life
will undoubtedly cause an unusual
stag line. To remedy any possible
preponderance of lone males, Hew
lett suggests that all loyal Stanford
women come over, accompanied or
unaccompanied.
