# FROSH LAWYERS IN STORMY TILT
## Huneke, Mellinkoff Win Case On Fist Fight 
### 
Pleading that a concealed weapon
had been drawn out of the past
history of an ex-prizefighter to
break another man's jaw, Abe Mel
linkoff won his case last night in
the Stanford School of Law Moot
Court trial.
Lucien Shaw, member of the Moot
Court Board, judged the case in
volving a light between two Irish
men. The fight was agreed upon to
settle a boundary dispute, and the
smaller man, an ex-prizefighter,
broke the other's jaw, a suit for
damages resulting.
John Huneke and Abe Mellinkoff
recovered damages on the conten
tion that excessive force had been
used to break their cleint's jaw, that
he did not intend to accept the risk,
and that the fact that one was an
ex-prizefighter constituted in effect,
a hidden weapon.
Jim Richmond and Homer Kid
well contended that the consent to
an illegal act removed any claim for
damages and fighting is illegal, being
a breach of the peace. The smaller
man also took the bigger risk, they
maintained.
Shaw, in rendering decision,
pointed out that the weight, of au
thority was in favor of the Richmond
and Kidwell team, but the Huneke-
Mellinkoff presentation of argument
won the trial decision for them.
Tonight's trial at 7:15 o'clock in
Room 12 will be judged by Perry
Churchill, winner of last year's moot
court tournament. It will be between
Louis Bulasky and Bob Gahagan,
and a team of George Bellows and
Louis Penfield. The question will in
volve a man's right to recover wages
for services rendered when he has
broken a contract.
