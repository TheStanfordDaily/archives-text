The curtain will part at 8:30
j o'clock sharp tomorrow night, to re-
I veal Frederick Stover's setting of
the rich home of Edward Seton, and
i Harold Helvenston's cast will step
into the action of the Philip Barry
i playâ€”a prospect which promises
; superlative entertainment to every
; ticket-holder.
"Holiday" is acclaimed the best of
: Barry's many successful plays, com
bining numerous excellent qualities.
'It has a good plot: the story of
Linda's disgust with her money-
J craving family, and how she finds a
kindred soul in Johnny Case, to
l whom her sister Julia is engaged.
The characters are well-drawn:
Linda is one of the best of modern
j feminine comedy roles; Julia, Ed
j ward, and Ned, the rest of the fam
ily, are finely drawn. The mad Pot
ters, Susan and Nick, are delight
| fully unique; the Crams, "the out
-1 lying Setons," are perfect types.
Dialogue Natural
But the greatest charm of the play
| lies in its dialogue, which, in addi
j tion to being rapid, brilliant, and
j amusing, is consistently natural.
Marian Jones plays Linda Seton;
Mary Anita Loos, Julia, and James
j Benet, Johnny Case. Others in the
: cast are Joseph Wolf, John Peck
i ham, Bob Churchill, Eleanor Furst,
i Elizabeth Chapin, Carter Meyer,
| Will Williams, Balcom Moore, and
Eleanor Harris.
