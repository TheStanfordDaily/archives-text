# Predict Record Bid Sale For Annual Toyon Dance
## 
### 
Reports of the transformation of
Toyon's spacious lobby into a Mor
rocan palace, and the engagement
of Bunny Burson's Bal Tabarin or
chestra to provide music, have
boosted the early bid sale for the
annual Toyon Formal to far beyond
the expectations of Chairman Milo
Tally.

Although the bids have been of
fered to Toyon Club members only
as yet, their sale has shattered most
records for early purchasing. Tally
and Herb Sanderson are superin
tending the decorating, which they
announce will be featured by many
novel effects.
