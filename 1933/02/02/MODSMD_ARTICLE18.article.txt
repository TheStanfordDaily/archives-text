# COOPERATION OF STUDENTS ROTH'S PLEA
## University Faces Economy Move On Account Of Depression 
### 
Co-operation of all Stanford forces
to weather the depression just as
the University has withstood the
crises of the famous Stanford law
suit, the earthquake, and the World
War, was stressed by Comptroller
Almon E. Roth in his address at the
All-University question-and-answer
assembly held yesterday morning.
"Planning a budget based on the
same enrollment as last year, Uni
versity officials were dismayed to
find 318 less students last fail and
more than 400 less students in win
ter quarter," stated Roth. "This
meant a decline in the University
income of $150,000, which was made
up by budget slashes and decreased
expenditures. Since tuition fees sup
ply 33 to 34 per cent of the Univer
sity income it is impossible to re
duce the tuition at present.
Endowment Sixth
"Although the Stanford endow
ment has been invested most con
servatively in bonds of a preferred
type, business organizations have
affected the income so that $82,000
will be lost this year. The ranchers
who purchased the University farms
are at present unable to pay any
thing."
Roth explained that Stanford, in
1920 the richest endowed university
in the United States, in 1930 had
dropped to sixth place. In scholar
ship funds, Stanford with 810,000
yearly to award is far behind Yale
with its $515,000 annually in student
grants. The Comptroller lauded the
Board of Trustees and the student
relief committee for their efforts in
behalf of students.
Dining Halls Praised
"It is unfair to compare Union and
Encina Dining Hall prices with the
prices of the 67 eating establish
ments of the near vicinity," stated
the Comptroller. "Since one-third of
these are expected to go broke with
in the year, they are operated on a
cut-throat basis. The Stanford eat
ing places have continued their load
of student help without a slash in
student wages, while outside com
petitors work students for 20 cents
an hour and three hours a day for
three meals. The maintenance of the
campus dining halls is higher since
they can be effectively used only
eight months of the year while local
merchants have a year-around sell
ing period."
In answer to factual questions,
Roth stated that the extent of the
campus was 8824 acres. None of the
original Palo Alto Slock Farm can
be sold. Parts of the University
property outytde of this may be dis
posed of. The stone for campus
buildings was obtained at the Al
maden quarry near San Jose. The
Library was built of sandstone from
a quarry on the Stanford campus.
