# Nazi Control No Menace To German Government
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
With much tolerance F. W. Stroth- t
j mann, professor of German, assured
i a representative from the campus
] press yesterday that the ascendance
J of Adolph Hitler to the chancellor
! ship does not mean complete re
versal of German government.
"Hitler's appointment is, perhaps,
the last attempt to form a govern
ment: on a constitutional basis," ex
plained Strothmann. The Nazi was
chosen leader of the new coalition
cabinet when his became the most
powerful party in the Reichstag. To
; continue in office, a chancellor must
j command a majority in parliament.
Such backing is difficult to gain
j since a fifth of the seats are held
j by communists who vote against
I whichever government is in power.
It is uncertain whether Hitler can
j obtain the necessary 51 per cent
l vote.
"What will be the outcome of the 1
j Hitler regime I do not know." said
| Strothmann. "Even if I were a poli
j tician i« the heart of Berlin I would
not be able to make any predic-
I tions."
Hitler, connected in American j

i minds with Mussolini and Stalin,
has little chance of becoming a dic
tator. Several years ago his political
activities led him before the su
preme court of Germany where he
took an oath never to attempt to
gain control of the government
through extra-legal means.
"The Nazi platform is, like all
party platforms, a pledge of unem
ployment relief, disarmament, and
ambiguous tariffs."
In spite of his confirmed nation
alism, Hitler preaches nothing com
parable to Mr. Hearst's "Buy Amer
ican." "Such a policy would cut off
foreign trade and cause Germany's
suicide," Hitler's countryman com
mented.
Professor Strothmann left th •
University of Cologne in 1930 to join
the Stanford faculty. A scholar,
rather than-a politician, he was not
a party member while in Germany.
"At first I thought myself too
young to understand politics and
then I decided that it would require
an inordinate amount of time to
choose which party to enter," he
said.
