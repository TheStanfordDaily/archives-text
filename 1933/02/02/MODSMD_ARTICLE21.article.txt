# Frosh Debate Team Victors In Gael Meet
## War Debts Subject Of Tilt With St. Mary's Frosh 
### 
Disproving the old theory that
"You can't beat the Irish," three
Stanford freshmen last night took a
14 to 9 audience decision from a trio
of yearling debaters from St. Mary's.
Presenting the affirmative side of
the question, "Resolved, That the
United States should agree to the
cancellation of the interallied war
debts," Stanford's Lundin, Anderson,
and Greunberg won the victory on
the basis of the argument: Europe
cannot pay.
Outstanding for the squad from
the Farm was rebuttal speaker Ar
thur Lundin. This logical speaker
clearly stated the crux of the argu
ment: "If Europe can pay, we want
her to pay. But if she cannot pay,
there is nothing to do but cancel
the debts."
The affirmative then indicated that
payment in gold, goods, or anything
else was an economic impossibility.
Of gold, stated the affirmative., there
was not enough in the world to pay
off the debts.
Said Stanford's red-headed An
derson: "If we succeed in collecting
all the gold of the world, Europe
will be forced off the gold standard,
and our gold will be worthless. Per
haps we could use it for earrings."
