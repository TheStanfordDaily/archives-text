During (ho tour years of which the present undergradu
;ile genera lion can speak with accuracy, the lime-honored
sport ot boxing has evolved from a more or less intra
gvinnasium sport into an activity of all-campus interest.
Hehind lliis accumulative popularity of Stanford fisticuffs
is the ever-increasing skill and aggressiveness of the men
in the cardinal trunks, and behind that greater proficiency
in the manly art Harry Malonev, principally.
Next to Maloney's heart, after his native interest in
young men and their good health, of course, is the inter
collegiate sport of boxing. The manner in which, in these
past lew years, the dean of the Indian coaching staff has
imparled his own enthusiasm and knowledge of the sport
lo the inexperienced mitt-tossers who report to him in
hneina (ivm has been little short of miraculous. Ablv as
sisted by Myron Schall, Maloncv has gradually raised the
standard of Stanford boxing, until, in the past two seasons,
Indian varsity boxers have come to be recognized by the
sporting gentry hereabouts as very capable amateurs.
Hut Stanford boxing has improved not only in the K.O.
and decision columns. The sport has come to be accepted
as the most sportsmanlike of all Indian athletic endeavors,
and the guiding spirit behind that "fair play" characteristic
of boxing has, again, been Harry Malonev.
Tonight the products of Maloney's and Schall's tutelage
again display their wares in tlit* Pavilion, at the annual
AII -1 diversity championships. The time has come when no
Stanford student has to be urged lo attend one of these box
ing exhibitions if lie can possibly make it, he goes, and
that's all there is to it, for he realizes that he will see the
acme of sportsmanship and hard-fought action.
