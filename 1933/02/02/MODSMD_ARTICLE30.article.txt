# A 						LOSS

Sport liilis ail over California regret the action of
I'.C.L.A in dropping tennis and baseball. This move is
particularly regrettable for the Hrtiins, as tliev were just
on the verge of becoming one of the leading universities in
athletics on the coast.
I he question that rises to everyone's mind is why did
the Bruins keep on with rowing? drew, as a sport, is un
doubtedly the most expensive pastime in collegiate compe
tition. California, itself, cannot support her crew without
the aid of outside contributions. Besides expensive equip
ment, crew races have no gate receipt returns.
This decision on the part of I'.C.L.A. appears like the
stubborn resistence of a spoilt child. When the wealthiest
universities in the Kast give up the most classic race in
lowing, the lull seriousness of the situation is realized. The
Bruins were given a couple of shells, and so they imagine
that all they need do now is row around in them. The
question of upkeep, new oars, outrigging gear, coach's
salary, boat house, and a hundred other items does not
faze them.
According to an old salt, "Any old boat, and anv crew,
won't make a seagoing outfit."
