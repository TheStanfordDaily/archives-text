# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
It must be well known by this
time that the Bull Session has a very
sensitive soul—one that would make
a pink morning-glory look like a
dried-up rubber plant. He lies awake
nights, cringing and moaning over
the cruel lash of criticism. Concen
trated sulphuric acid on a raw
wound would be soothing treatment
when compared to harsh words and
bitter glances.
Thus it was, that when yesterday
a sweet butterfly tittered to us on
the Quad about the horribly de
structive policy of this column, we
resolved immediately to show every- I
one we had oud Pollyanna qualities.
We had, however, always felt that
there were plenty of intellectual
hod-carriers who were willing to
dump loud hosannas at the slightest
provocation. We had always hoped
to sort of balance things by u mild
criticism every now and then.
Today, however, is dedicated to
praise and the job we find is singu- i
larly easy. The Libe has taken a
beating lately—on two of its deli
cate spots, Felton Library, and Re
served Book Room. But while the j
Libe has its bottoms to be spanked,
it also has its backs to be patted.
On with the patting.
For some reason or another, we
are always seeking out peculiar
facts—Were Napoleon's upper molars !
gold-filled?— Was Helen of Troy a

LAUREL FOR THE LIBE

; 1 stomach and an itching larnyx? To
find the answers to such questions is
most difficult—impossible as a per-
I sonal job.
Here comes the Reference Room
of the Library. The librarians in
this department are so helpful that
I actually become embarrassed at
the attention they shower on a poor
student in distress. They might sneer
me away to the Card Catalogue—
the infinite morgue of complexity
and obscurity—the answer to a lazy
librarian's dream. But the women
in the Reference Room will buzz
around for 20 minutes or more to
i find the answer to what seems to
them, no doubt, a foolish question.
And ditto for the Periodical Room
—magazines and newspapers to you.
I have the unhappy faculty of al
ways wanting to read some maga
zine that is lost, destroyed, stolen,
or on its way to the bindery. The
women in this room will flit here
and there, thumb piles of dusty
I papers to find what you want. Their
patience is infinite—Job-like.
The personnel in both of these
j rooms takes the attitude that it is
there to help the student—unique
outlook, indeed. They never make
the student suffer the consequences
of their upset stomachs, visiting
relatives, and falling arches.
And for all this sincere praise, I
surely wish that the Library would .
install soap in the men's washroom. J
j It's vital. —Abe Mellinkoff
