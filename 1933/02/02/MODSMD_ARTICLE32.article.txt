DIE LINDENWIIITIN VOM IIIIEIN
—At the Varsity Theatre.
This is somewhat better than most
German operettas, mainly because j
it is not stereotyped and has a more
varied score. But to offset these ad
vantages it has a jerky, somewhat |
sobby, and not well-motivated plot; I
nor can the acting be commended— '
all the characters overact. Another
influence not before noticed in Ger
man movies is the imitation of
American singing; in other words,
emphasis on gesture and exagger
ated expression rather than on
melody—really a pity, since the
melodies are good. Hollywood influ
ence is also shown in an egg-throw
ing scene and the sentimental ges- i
ture of dashing a wine-glass to the
ground after a "Vesti la Guibba" j
song. Spontaneity, one of the best i
features of German operettas, is not
so noticeable here. The long running j
time, addition of much that does not
aid the action, and long song inter
ludes tend to make the picture drag
slightly. —Zimansky

INVITATION TO THE WALTZ—
By Rosamond Lchmann. Henry
Holt and Company, 1932.
Rosamond Lehmann has again '
written a psychological novel, but
this time she has returned to the !
theme of her first book and written
the story of a young girl. She has
portrayed Olivia Curtis in a sympa
thetic and human light., and with an
added increase of power from her
first two books.
"Invitation to the Waltz" presents
a shoi't but illuminating picture of ;
English country life in the years
following the War. It has its main
concern with Olivia's first entrance
into society in the form of a coun
try dance, a program affair, which
still clings to the formality of Be
fore-the-War dances. Miss Lehmann
has made her portrait of Olivia even
more finished by the contrast of
Olivia and her more striking and
popular sister, Kate, who meets with
no complications at the dance, and
who makes a great success, while
Olivia is desperately trying to hide
her own unpopularity.
Miss Lehmann possesses the abil
ity to paint a character with only a
few strokes of her pen. From begin
ning to end, even the most minor
person makes as vivid an impres
sion as Olivia. With a few words,
she contrives to make Miss Robin
son, the dressmaker, Marigold, the
hostess, Timmy, the blind man, and
all the others who form the back
ground for Olivia, real and vivid.
Though the first portion of (he
book drags, the action quickens as
thp writer comes to the story of
the dance, and does not lag again.
The actual technique employed in

the section concerning the dance is
thoroughly in keeping with the
spirit of such an affair by reason of
its short interludes which seem to
coiTespond to each number the or
chestra plays. On the whole, the
book is admirably written, and adds
considerably to Miss Lehmann's po
sition as a writer. —C. Hayes
