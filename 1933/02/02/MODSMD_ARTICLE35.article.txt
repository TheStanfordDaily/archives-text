### OLD DR. ALGAR 
RIFLE, Colo.—Not since the early
days of the war has there been such
a demand for horses. It's because
farmers can raise hay for horses but
not gasoline for tractors and auto
mobiles, horse dealers declare. The
Rifle horsemen deliver them wild or
tame. Buyers who don't specify get
carloads of raging horse flesh righ'
off the range.
Jake Onionseed found in his
R.F.D. box
A card telling recent arrival
of mail.
Perhaps 'twas the horse he had
ordered, b'gosh—
He headed for town all excited
and pale.
In town he discovered the
Two-Thirty wrecked,
The hoss he had ordered had
derailed the cars.
Some three counties over the
critter was checked,
In jail he was placed—but he
kicked out the bars.
The hoss ran away and re
turned to the hills;
•The town had the look 'of a
quake on a spi'ee.
Poor Onionseed took it all
calmly until—
The government wrote him,
"Past due: C.0.D."
