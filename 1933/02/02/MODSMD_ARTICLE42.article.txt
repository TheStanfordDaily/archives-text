# Injured California Frosh Return To Bear Hoop Fold
## 
### 
California's freshman basketball
team will be no set-up for Jimmy
Bradshaw's fast-moving Papooses
Saturday night. This much was as
sured with the return of center
Harry Cordes from the ranks of the
injured, and guard Ed C?rcy from
the limbo of ineligibility.
These two jn<?n were considered
the backbone of the Bear Cub of
f-nsive power until they were
snatched from competition. Their
loss served to introduce Art Night
, ingale, a high-scoring forward, to
fame. Nightingale has been the
power behind the throne during the
absence of the other two yearling
stars.
