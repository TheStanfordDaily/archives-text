# FROSH AQUATIC STARS TO PLAY VIKINGS TODAY
## Yearlings Favored To Win Second Battle Against Palo Alto 
### 
Fresh from a victory over the
Olympic Club juniors and raring to
go, Coach Nort Thornton's frosh
water polo team tangles with the
1 Palo Alto High septet this afternoon
in Encina pool. The contest, which
i will not be open to the public, marks
the yearlings' second appearance
against the Paly boys within two
weeks, having met and beaten the
town aggregation by a 3 to 2 score
last Thursday.
Because of their rapid improve
ment and due to the fact that the
high-school lads have had no place
adequate to practice since Christ
( mas, the Stanford babes are favored,
although the battle should be close.
Thornton's team will be consider
ably strengthened by the return of
Elliott Viney, versatile aquatic star
who will probably fill in at guard
this afternoon. The remainder of the
first-year men's line-up will be
Danforth, Ludlum, and Rulison, for
wards; Captain Myers and Woodard
at the other two guard positions, and
Livingston at goal guard.
Baxter will be held in reserve and
' should see action.
Leading lights for Coach Bob
Fraser's seven are Giffen, Gibb, and
McKenzie.
