# CLUBMEN LOSE TO CARD TANK STARS 5 TO 2
## Taranik Stars As Stanford Takes Leadership Of Water Polo League 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo team
took undisputed leadership in the
Northern California Water Polo
League by defeating the Athens
Club 5 to 2 at Oakland last night.
Vlad Taranik, star sophomore
guard, who is fast becoming one of
the outstanding tank stars on the
Pacific Coast, was high-scorer for
the Indians with three goals. Jimmy
Triolo, another sophomore flash,
scored the other two goals.
However, it was the smooth work
of the entire team rather than the
ability of any one man that won
for Stanford. Coach Nort Thornton's
new fast-passing attack calls for ab
solute teamwork and makes it dif
ficult to select any individual star.
Others in the Indian lineup were
Ted Wiget and Dick Hirsch, for
wards, Don Kinkead and Gordy
Graves, guards, and Burke Knapp,
goal guard. Knapp was relieved by
Leo Cook in the second half.
Gordon Corson, former University
of Oregon star and captain of the
Athens Club -team, was outstanding
for the Oakland team. He and Mc-
Means each scored one goal.
Washington University co-eds
spend more money for cigarettes
than the men students do.
