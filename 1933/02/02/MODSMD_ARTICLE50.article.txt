That track meet with U.C.L.A. is definitely off, or anyway that is the
latest word we get via the grapevine route. Incidentally, it was the
reason that Stanford has been so late with the arrangement of its
schedule. As originally planned, "Dink" and a crew of 20 men were to
travel South sometime in April. Evidently the rival managements could
not agree on a satisfactory date.
Meanwhile, Templeton is taking advantage of the few days of
spring weather to turn his hand to some new-fangled ideas. And
the most revolutionary of these is the so-called Finnish style in
the javelin throw. Few. if any, of the Coast spear-slinger* have
attempted to perfect themselves at this method. It seems an art
peculiarly the property of the countries north of the Baltic. Every
time an American ace in the event adds a couple of feet to his
best mark, some Finn will come right back and raise him five. An
odd difference between the American and the Finnish style; the
former tires the muscles in the shoulders; while the latter affects
the hips and back. Anyway, that's the dope as we hear it.
Something else again is the new crouching start which Templeton is
trying out. Eastman, A1 Blaqkman, Les Hables, Jimmy Howell, and Frank
Lombardi are all working at it. And who looks the best? Yes, you've
guessed it! Mr. Ben Bangs Eastman.
And while mentioning track: Stanford may well be represented by her
strongest all-time hurdle team this year. Gus Meier, Cotto Herbert, and
Dave Packard form a trio that would gladden any coach's heart.
Despite the royal bird which the fancy guys up on the U.C.
campus diffidently handed out to our Norman Clcaveland, the
latter has not given up hope of arranging a game. "The Cali
fornians claim they have no one to coach the game," he says.
"They've forgotten George Dixon and Fddie Graff, who both
played on Olympic teams. Maybe Nibs Price could give a pointer
or two, he knows what it's all about." And Harry Maloney says
with a broad smile that the reason rugby is a major sport was
given up in these parts was because Stanford began to knock the
Bear's ears down too often. Or words to that effect.

Yowsa, they look real good, do Wolter's ball hawks. And notwith
standing yesterday's loss, Stark, Howe, and Savinske, the three untried,
untested pitchers who started, looked plenty fancy. And Anderson, Her
ringer, and Estes are counted on to lead the hurling staff. —F.K.IL
