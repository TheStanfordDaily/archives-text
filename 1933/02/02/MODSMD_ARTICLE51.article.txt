Paul Zulch, the Stanford Daily OUT
fought, OUT-ran, OUT-substituted,
OUT-time-OUT-ed, and OUT
fouled a bunch of hams from Phi
Delta Phi, in a scrumptuous mural
basketball classic last night. The
lawyers OUT-shot the jourialists,

Teague and Edmonds during the
first twenty seconds of play, tiring
a bit after that (Afternoon Club

Business Staff Moguls Phil Kennedy
and Milt Newman were dazzling Phi
Delta Phi collectively with count-
LESS baskets during the second
half. Slippery Dave Cooke, and Milt
Friedman, two eel-like guards or
something, also ran.
With thirty-seven seconds left to
play Stuart "Stewed" Dufour, Rus
sell Paine, and Joe Hiram Graves
entered the contest, and executed a
TRIPLE play which was so funny
the Phi Phi's nearly had TRIPLETS.
And then (it burns to think of it),
with only Paul Zullch, Dr of rials, and
the Deke calf on the bench (12.5
seconds to go) the Daily team then
on the floor collapsed in a body.
Zulch was selected, and he entered
Ihe fray, scoring seven times during
the few fleetitng moments that re
mained before the whistle.
Julius Jacobs, Dick Strouse, Frank
Moore, Bill Cole, Pete Hewit, Jane
Dodge, and Collier Connell (not to
mention seedy Mynard and beauti
ful Callahan), played the best games
for the Daily. They didn't turn up
for the contest, so they did every
thing right.
