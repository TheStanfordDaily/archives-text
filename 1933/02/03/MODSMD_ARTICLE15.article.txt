# Dr. Herre Makes Largest Collection Of Island Fish
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Hook and line, nets, dynamite
traps, and deadly poisons were some
of the devices employed by Dr. Al
bert W. Herre, famed Stanford ich
thyologist, in making the largest
collection of fish of the Philippine
group ever gathered by a scientist
on a single trip.
Dr. Herre returned from the Is
lands over a year ago, and he has
just finished assorting his find, which
includes about 25 species of fish
never before found anywhere in the
world. Over 100 of the fish he dis
covered had never been observed in
the Philippines before, and a con
siderable number in addition have
never been represented in the mu
seums of Europe or America.
When Dr. Herre first went to the
Philippines there were only 830 fish
known to exist in that region. He

has himself since discovered more
than that number additional.
The Museum curator pointed oui
that the Philippines are a biological
part of ihe East Indies, and that this
region is the greatest center of fish
life in the world. He says he has
seen schools of sardines seven miles
long, and that he has counted 3,060,-
000 ripe eggs ready to spawn in one
female bango only tjiree-quarters of
a meter long. If all these eggs be
came adult, the oceans would soon
be filled solid with this species.
Dr. Herre estimates that there are
about 20,000 known fish in the
world, and that about 2,000 of these
may be found in the Philippines.
His success in fish collecting is due
to great, familiarity with local con
ditions, and to the enthusiastic co
operation of his friends, both white
and native, throughout the Islands.
