# CAMPUS AWAITS ALL-MALE SHOW
## Women May Submit Scripts In Men's Burlesque Stage Offering 
### 
Although the Stanford Theatre
Fund Burlesque set for presentation
on May 26 will be exclusively male
cnacted, campus women are said to
be enthusiastic over the possibili
ties of the show. Not only does the
committee expect the prospect of
watching the male antics to appeal
to them, but they are privileged to
submit scripts if they so desire. The
men will then act out their gags if
one of their scripts is selected by
the nine judges.
All registered students who have
any shred of ability are urged by
the committee to put a synopsis on
paper and present it before March
18. One of the functions of the bur
lesque will be to afford an outlet for
campus writers to produce some
thing for footlights consumption,
which function was filled until this
year by the Junior Opera.
Lack of musical ability will not be
a deterrent to aspiring writers of
scripts. Only a suggestion of the
type of music and the number of
songs needed is required. After the
closing date for scripts, announce
ment of the music wanted will be
made, and campus composers may
then swing into action.
Continuity is requisite to the
scripts; a series of skits is not what
is wanted. Two acts and two set
tings will be the most acceptable;
and limitations of the Stanford stage
must be kept in mind. Not over two
authors wili be permitted to col
laborate on one entry.
