Discussing proposed school legis
lation and answering the most prev
alent criticisms against the state
program of education, Dr. Willard
E. Givens, city superintendent of
schools in Oakland, addressed :i
group of persons interested in edu
cation Wednesday night in the Little
Theatre.
He showed that the arguments
charging extravagance against the
state department of education are
without foundation, quoting startling
statistics to prove that fully half of
the ryral schools in this country are
now closed for lack of funds and
some nine and one-half million chil
dren actually without any education
facilities. "We do not want anything
like that to happen in California,"
he said.
Following the lecture, a reception
in the Stanford Women's Clubhouse
was given by Pi Lambda Theta, na
tional education honor fraternity for
women, which sponsored the lecture.
