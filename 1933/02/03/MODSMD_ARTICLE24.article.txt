# Upset Likely In U. C. Hoop Battle Tomorrow Night
## Card Five Stages Comeback in Two Weeks Following First California Defeat; Edelen's Improvement Gives Stanford Needed Offensive 
### BOBB LETTS 
The co-holder of the cellar position meets a serious contender for tlx-
Pacific Coast Conference title here tomorrow night, and an upset—Midi
as frequently features basketball games—is likely.
The event, second game of the annual series between California and
Stanford, sees Coach John Buiui's Indians with their backs to the wall
ready to lower a well-polished scoring tomahawk on the Bear's scalp.
Staging a gradual and rather effective comeback in three games played
since their 24-37 setback at the hands of Nibs Price's Berkeleyans two
weeks ago, the Indians have arrived at .*t point where, if they click as thc>
can, they will bounce back and beat California by a close margin. Long
looked for, a Stanford victory is in the offing tomorrow evening. The main

* event starts at 8 o'clock, with th"
freshman preliminary at 6:30 o'clock.
Coach Bunn announced his starl
ing lineup of Captain Tom Cordry,
Hal Edelen, Keith Topping, Jay Tod,
and John Hancock at the close of
yesterday afternoon's practice ses
sion, and this combination is ex
pected to give the visitors a worry
or two.
The great improvement Edelen

has shown in the last two weeks
i gives Stanford the neded drive its
I offense has lacked thus far. His
passing and general floorwork Ims
added punch to the scoring machine,
and he has been coming through
needed asset. Teaming with Cordry
with enough baskets to make him a
and Topping, Edelen gives the In
dians three dependable point
makers.
California, dith Hal Eifert, Jack
Rea'd, "Bones" Coughlan, Murray
Wemple, and John Crowley, will
have plenty to shoot at Stanford, but
the guard-work of Jay Tod and
John Hancock should prevent the
; Bears from scoring much at close
1 range.
Distance-shooting, at which U.C.
is adeptly led by the smooth-work
ing Eifert, should feature the Bin ■
and Gold attack. Eifert, second
highest in the conference scoring
race, will have to work to keep his
individual honors, for Keith Top
ping, who is about as good a sopho
more as Stanford could ever hope
to have, will be around hoping to
improve his present fourth position.
Topping is but one point behind
Jerry "Nemo" Nemer, Southern
California hot shot.
Game Should Be Good
Tomorrow night's game should be
almost a direct, opposite of the first
contest of the series. In that battle,
neither team played much good ball.
Only one man, Eifert, did justice to
himself, although Read and Ted
Ohashi, the clever Japanese guard,
did pretty well.
Stanford will be hot tomorrow
j night, if ever it will be this season.
Everything has come along nicely
under Coach Bunn, his team has
perked up, he has fo\md three
steady forwards—including Carrel
Weaver—and "dope," that great nu
merical bungler, has given the In
dian camp a chance to whoop it up.

dians three dependable point
makers.
California, dith Hal Eifert, Jack
Rea'd, "Bones" Coughlan, Murray
Wemple, and John Crowley, will
have plenty to shoot at Stanford, but
the guard-work of Jay Tod and
John Hancock should prevent the
; Bears from scoring much at close
1 range.
Distance-shooting, at which U.C.
is adeptly led by the smooth-work
ing Eifert, should feature the Bin ■
and Gold attack. Eifert, second
highest in the conference scoring
race, will have to work to keep his
individual honors, for Keith Top
ping, who is about as good a sopho
more as Stanford could ever hope
to have, will be around hoping to
improve his present fourth position.
Topping is but one point behind
Jerry "Nemo" Nemer, Southern
California hot shot.
Game Should Be Good
Tomorrow night's game should be
almost a direct, opposite of the first
contest of the series. In that battle,
neither team played much good ball.
Only one man, Eifert, did justice to
himself, although Read and Ted
Ohashi, the clever Japanese guard,
did pretty well.
Stanford will be hot tomorrow
j night, if ever it will be this season.
Everything has come along nicely
under Coach Bunn, his team has
perked up, he has fo\md three
steady forwards—including Carrel
Weaver—and "dope," that great nu
merical bungler, has given the In
dian camp a chance to whoop it up.
The co-holder of the cellar position meets a serious contender for tlx-
Pacific Coast Conference title here tomorrow night, and an upset—Midi
as frequently features basketball games—is likely.
The event, second game of the annual series between California and
Stanford, sees Coach John Buiui's Indians with their backs to the wall
ready to lower a well-polished scoring tomahawk on the Bear's scalp.
Staging a gradual and rather effective comeback in three games played
since their 24-37 setback at the hands of Nibs Price's Berkeleyans two
weeks ago, the Indians have arrived at .*t point where, if they click as thc>
can, they will bounce back and beat California by a close margin. Long
looked for, a Stanford victory is in the offing tomorrow evening. The main

* event starts at 8 o'clock, with th"
freshman preliminary at 6:30 o'clock.
Coach Bunn announced his starl
ing lineup of Captain Tom Cordry,
Hal Edelen, Keith Topping, Jay Tod,
and John Hancock at the close of
yesterday afternoon's practice ses
sion, and this combination is ex
pected to give the visitors a worry
or two.
The great improvement Edelen

has shown in the last two weeks

I offense has lacked thus far. His
passing and general floorwork Ims
