I lar campus dance of the quarter.

Selection of chaperons for the

j For the first time in many years
' of campus social life, a good orches
; tra and a distinguished locale for
J the dance will be provided for only
| twenty-five cents per person.
No Fancy Clothes
One thing is insisted on by Marion
Hewlett, the chief of the committee
! making preparations for the dance:
| "Don't put on fancy, fancy clothes
| for the dance, and then have to go
, through the rigors of a Bronx cheer
at the basketball game. Come as
you would to any basketball game,
and don't change your clothes be
fore coming to the dance!"
"But the main thing is: Come!
| Some of those fellows eating one
| meal a day need a share of your
I two-bits; and your feet need an
J active yet economical evening."
