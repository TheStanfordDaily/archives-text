# A 						PHILOSOPHY FOR BASKETBALL

### 
Aside I coin Hie rough ladies employed l>v learns in the
(.ouf ereiiee maple-court league, there is 1 ittie excuse ap
parent lor combining football and basketball into a single
topic lor editorial discussion. Hut another excuse was fur
nished yesterday, and by none other than Pop Warner,
erstwhile Indian football .coach, now looking things over
Warner remarked, within earshot of the Associated
Press, as follows: "I hey lake their football too franticallv,
too liercelv out West. There is 100 much rivalry. It is a
case ol too much Jones against Warner or Ingram against
Jones. Here in tin 4 Mast, the sports writers say more about
the players than the coaches and that is right. It still is the
boys' game and belongs to them.'"
That's tirsl-hand observation, all right. Warner ought
to know all about the Pacific Coast football hysteria, and
he does. Perhaps he would be a trifle more accurate in say
ing that the students, at Stanford, lake their football "Fran
tically, the alumni "100 fiercely." It's a deplorable truism,
however, llnil much of the spirit and sportsmanship of the
game is losl in the vearlv bleats of "Heal t'.S.C." and "Poor
Cal."
Hasketball at Stanford is affected by no such neurasthe
nic disorder. The line which divides student attitudes
toward football and basketball is difficult to locate, but
definite nevertheless. There is something more of Hie more
sportsmanlike "somebody loses, somebody wins" philoso
phy in the student altitude toward the hoop sport, born, no
doubl, of a long deeension of mediocre teams. Regardless of
its hereditary determinants, however, that altitude is ad
mirable, and well-suited to the basketball situation at Stan
ford.
