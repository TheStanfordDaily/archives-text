# THE 						OLYMPICS OF 1933
## 
### 
Hatched in till' minds of (lie Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce, the suggestion comes lo luive a "menial Olym
pics.'" Whether lliis idea was stimulated by having the
champion heavyweight mentality of the world Mr. Kin
stein residing in the city lias not heen ascertained. This
gentleman would certainly he the feature attraction.
Many interesting situations might develop if we can use
the late Olympics as a guide. For instance imagine the
irritation of the entrant who read three extra hooks of a
Greek tragedy 'because of the mistake of an ollicial. Or
again picture the contestant, who having just completed a
mighty oration, finds the judges were all looking out the
window at a "hurdv gurdv" and his trained monkey.
The only lfitcli that appears on the horizon is the possi
bility that Los Angeles will not be able to rake up any
entrants. Of course Hollywood might rise to this demand.
The motion picture industry has met more complicated
situations than this din ing the course of its brilliant career.
Willi a good profile, and a cleverly written script, Molly
wood's entry would undoubtedly startle the intellects of
the world.
