# BULL SESSION
## AFTER THE GAME IS OVER 
### 
When the last peanut has been
eaten; and the lungs are fired and
lame (from booing)—trot over to
the Women's Gym tomorrow night
for a little pleasant merry-making.
The Ex Committee has proved itself
to be more than an Abolition Society
in staging an all-campus dance after
Saturday's basketball game with the
predatory Bears.
There is always a conspicuous void
after a basketball game. It's too late
for the second show in Paly—too
late, of course, to begin studying
(und it would have been too early
before the game—in fact there are
usually only two things to do. First,
mull over the wonderful shots made
and the hidden fouls that, the dumb :
"ref" missed. All "refs" are dumb:
and there are always wonderful
shots — so conversation is never!
starved.
The other thing is to sit in a sor
ority parlor. Between rehashing a
basketball game and sitting in a
sorority parlor, there is little to
choose. The Dance tomorrow night
is a blessing— not in disguise, but
naked and welcome. It will no doubt
prove the Ex Committee so smart in
staging the affair that there will be
many more in the future. It will also
prove that the Campus has little in
clination to visit the Highway 1
Castles of Pleasure and has little
inclination and less money to trek
to the Big City.
The women will decide the fate of
this type of entertainment; reaffirm- i

1 ing an old axiom that we are con
fronted not with a condition or a
theory, but with women. If they
come to the Dance, the men will
dance. If they do not come, the men
will not dance. The women have, of
course, again the upper hand: if the
men don't come, they can dance
anyway. Anyway.
We would not expect a sweet
young thing to crash a big formal.
Of course, if she were good-looking
enough it might even work in that
situation. But Saturday's dance is
to be staged on the Marmoset of
Queensbury Rules. And I have it
straight from the Marmoset, that it
is perfectly great for women to come
i unescorted. Once in circulation on
the floor, everything is fine. And it
is so easy to get into circulation.
Walk into the Gym Court. Pretend
to look at the fountain. Look at the
fellow in Cit or Econ. The rest fol
lows the natural laws well known
to all.
Or you can go over to the refresh
ment booth. Eat a bite slowly and
nonchalantly. Somebody will come
by before you can fully negotiate
the food-in-hand. A few of the sour
faced damsels will probably sling to
the back of the house and work
puzzles under well-shaded lamps.
The sane and socially healthy will
be there Saturday.
And the Royal Cardinals have a
trio that sings well enough to justify
a men's trio. That's something on
this campus. • —Abe Mellinkoff

to be staged on the Marmoset of
Queensbury Rules. And I have it
straight from the Marmoset, that it
is perfectly great for women to come

the floor, everything is fine. And it
is so easy to get into circulation.

nonchalantly. Somebody will come

The Ex Committee has proved itself

Saturday's basketball game with the

There is always a conspicuous void

basketball game and sitting in a

is a blessing— not in disguise, but

prove the Ex Committee so smart in
staging the affair that there will be
many more in the future. It will also
prove that the Campus has little in

anyway. Anyway.
