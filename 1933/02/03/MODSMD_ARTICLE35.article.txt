CINEMATIC EMOTIONS ANI)
! CONJECTURE AS TO THEIR
PURPOSE.

1 The emotions of the cinema hero
i ine are, for Ihe most part, not only
inexplicable but entirely false. Love,
j so-called, the power behind a great
deal of Hollywood production, is
represented in a highly ridiculous
light.
For example, in , a recent film
called "Flesh," Miss Karen Morley,
introduced as a dryly humorous,
worldly-wise cynic, goes through an
amazing series of pu.shings and
shovings at the fists of a dominating
, lover and betrays her husband, the
stupid but kind-hearted Mr. Beery, 1
| innumerable times. Now any heroine
: as intelligent as Miss Morley is ob
! viously supposed to be in the earlier
stages of the picture, can hardly
maintain the respect of an observant
audience by the exercise of such
wildly improbable peccadilloes.
But Hollywood tells us that it is
Love which motivates this strange
attraction for a bounder who is
1 quite candidly betraying her him
: self; now, while love may be ex
tremely elastic, I fail to see precisely
how we may be expected to believe
that Miss Morley is such a complete
! fool.
Likewise, anger in a heroine, is
employed at the most ridiculous
moments, for the most trivial rea
sons, and for the most astoundingly
absurd lengths of timfc; the same is
i true, of jealousy, and fear, and all
the other emotions commonly ob
| served in cinematic—and even thea
j trical representations.
Now even Hollywood cannot be
so blind as to think this attenuated
passion a believable procedure. Why
then, is it utilized so unsparingly? I
think that its vise is to prolong
plots which have come to their logi
i cal ending three-quarters of an hour
before a movie audience habitually
goes home to bed.
Thus it is, when a hero and hero
ine embrace at 8:15 or 10:15 of an
evening, difficulties settled and a
moon in the background, some ob
struction will be found to lengthen
the picture to its usual running time;
it may be a chance call from the

gentleman's ex-mistress ("Devil to
Pay"), or a false idea of dignity
("Evenings for Sale"), or an im
proper proposal ("The Private Sec
retary"), or—in "The Animal King
dom"—a situation which, from the
first, is inconceivable if the protago
nist is to be a character which an
intelligent audience can admire. In
any case it is a very exasperating
habit. —Sandoe
THE LETTERS OF D. M. LAW
RENCE—•lntroduction by Aldous
Huxley. New York: The Viking
Press. 1932. $5.
Out of the maze of misinformed
books written to reveal D. H. Law
rence emerges this selection of his
own letters in which Lawrence re
veals himself more clearly than
anyone else could possibly have
done. The volume clarifies for us
the essence of his struggle with life,
his artistic spirit, and his fanati
cism. These fascinating letters will
certainly alter many popular con
ceptions of Lawrence, who from his
books is easily misinterpreted. They
illuminate his intense vitality, his
aliveness: creating, fighting, hating
messes, filled with beauty, possessed
by first the black devils, then by
the gay spirits within him.
It appears to have been difficult
for those who knew Lawrence to
write of him sanely, but Aldous
Huxley has done better than most.

While running into culs-de-sac in
some of his analyses, he does not go
far enough in defining the quality
in Lawrence which makes him great
and which also makes him difficult
to grasp. Mr. Huxley calls this his
awareness of "the dark presence of
the otherness which lies beyond the
boundaries of man's conscious mind."
This is but the keynote to Lawrence's
amazing ability to record the deeper,
unexpressed feelings which sur
round commonplace things, his gen
ius for catching the essential signifi
cance of transient emotions.
The letters begin after Lawrence
has made his first success and are
addressed to many celebrated per
sons. The absence of correspondence
to Mabel Dodge Luhan is gratifying.
In spite of the fact that there are
too many unimportant letters, the
volume as a whole gives a fine, ex
citing picture of Lawrence, showing
him a more vivid character than he
i.s in any of his books. He stands at
the end an honest, deeply sensitive,
courageous, and artistic revivalist.
Lawrence has written here an auto
biography greater than as if he had
consciously set about doing it.
