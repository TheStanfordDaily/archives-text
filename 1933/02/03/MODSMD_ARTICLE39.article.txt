The Editor, Sir:
Apropos of the "Buy American'
orgy now current, which is a swell
opportunity for little frogs in little
puddles like me to croak at bis*,
frogs in puddles like the two emi
nent gentlemen named below:
Caveat Emptor!
(Dedicated to the memory of the

Ideals that must surely fall in the
Curtis-Hearst offensive)
"Buy American!"
Sing that refrain—
' Buy American!"
Over again—
Together we stand,
Divided we fall—
You, brother! You, sister!
Americans all!
Heed publisher Curtis
And publisher Hearst:
'"To hell with the rest,
America First!"
"Buy American!"
Sing .that refrain—
"Buy American!"
Over again—
Descend! Golden eagle,
Vaunting on high;
We're clipping your pinions,
No more shall you fly!
Say goodbye to the heavens
That you knew so well—
We've made you a turtle,
Crawl ii.to your shell!
I remain, more amused than in
dignant,
Yours truly,
Charles McWadc, '36
