# ROUGH IS NONCHALANT Grades Are Nothing To Him ENVELOPES NOT LEFT
## 
### 
The Stanford type for 1933 is a
nonchalant individual in the process
of becoming more so, evidence at
the registrar's office shows. Students
are rapidly losing interest in mere
grades.
Of 3190 students enrolled fall
quarter 333, or 10 per cent, were not
sufficiently concerned to leave self
addressed envelopes nor to call for

grade sheets at the beginning of this
quarter. This loftiness with respect
to material indicators of Effort and
Class-Average has gained in extent
by 33 per cent over last year.
Since at first insouciance was
doubted as a cause, it was suggested
that it might be lack of a nickel for
the blue envelope. The registrar is
emphatic in stating that this is
scarcely valid because of the fact
that purchase of charity envelopes
is not compulsory.
It is not illegal to destroy money
completely so that it cannot be put
into circulation again.
