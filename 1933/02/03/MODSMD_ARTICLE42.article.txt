# Cards To Meet Oakland Nine On Diamond Tomorrow
## VARSITY WEAK ON BATTERY END AS INELIGIBILITY HITS Anderson Is Out; Catcher Livermore's Tossing Arm Doubtful 
### 
With one practice game over and
only two remaining before the open
ing conference game of the season,
with Santa Clara, Stanford's varsity
ball club will make its second ap
pearance against the Athens Club of
Oakland at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow
on the Sunken Diamond.
Coach Harry Wolter will start ap
proximately the same team that took
the field against the Keneally Seals
Wednesday with Mallatratt on first.
Chuck Clancy at second, Trautman
holding down third, Delmas com
pleting the infield, and Nutting
Maggiora, and Bullcr in the outfield.
IJ;tl(er.\ Is Weak
The battery problem* is the thing
that demands the most attention at
present. Wolter was counting on
Anderson, Este.s, Heringer, Savinske,
Stark, Howe, and Campbell. How
ever, with the faculty aze keeping
Stan Anderson out of the battle and
threatening to cut oil' Campbell, too,
Wolter is faced with the problem
of starting the pennant race with
only one pitcher who has any var
sity experience to speak of.
Another thing that leaves the at
mosphere a bit tense is the condi
tion of Captain Ike Livermore's
throwing arm. If the big catcher's
wing rounds into shape well, the
catching worries are over. Jim Mas
sey is a vastly improved receiver
this season, and with two good
catchers, Wolter can concentrate on
filing the holes in infield and out
field that need a lot of attention be
forel Stanford will be able to re
capture the conference crown.
Camphelf May Start
The batting exhibited in the Seal
game was better than expected, but
most of the boys still are sadly off
in their timing.
Providing that "Lofty" Campbell
is eligible, he will probably start the
game, with Masscy behind the plate.
Campbell has a nice delivery, and
fair control, but lacks experience,
and Wolter has very little time to
see how his new men will stand up
under the varsity* grind. Estes will
hurl the middle innings, and Harry
Stark will undoubtedly finish up.
Jobs in the outer garden have
been reduced to two with Miles
looking well in one. and Maggiora,
Nutting, Buller, Irsfeld, and Walline
battling for the remaining pair.
