# Sophs-Juniors Compete In Interclass Swimming Tilt
## 
### 
Sophomores against the juniors
seems to be the principal lineup in
today's interclass swimming meet.
These two classes apparently have
most of the material and should
provide a close battle for first place.
Ted Wiget is the juniors' ace in
the hole. They expect tlie National
Intercollegiate 440 champ to take
first in both the 220- and 440-vard
events. This will give them a com
manding lead over the sophomores,
who will depend on Dick Hirsch,
Jimmy Triolo, Vlad Taranik, and
their three varsity divers to garner
them enough points to overcome the
Wiget handicap.
The brcaststroke race between
Bob Clark, Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate champion, and Ken Living
ston, sensational freshman, will be
the feature race of the meet.
