Fresh l'rom an unorthodox win
ning streak of two victories in as
many starts, Stanford meets Cali
fornia again tomorrow night. A lot
of people hereabouts are hopeful
that Stanford will do something
about it. Anyway, we're willing to
lay a stone that the Cards take one
game of this series, at least.
Says Harry Borba in the San
Francisco News: "Stanfordites, once
the most cheek-turning crowd in
intercollegiate athletics, have be
come the bay region's most accom
plished set of booers." Well, the
secret is finally out! He should have
seen us Tuesday night, though. One
loud derisive jeer was the total of
the Stanford enthusiasm in this di
rection.
On the level, every time the
rooting section rises to its feet
to give that now familiar howl
of injury, we think of one night
in the new U.C. gym, where we
watched the game wedged be
tween two burly and bristle
whiskered Californians. When
ever the ref called a foul, no
matter how obvious, the two
whiskerinos, in common with
the rest of the crowd, cried
"Robbery!" Fortunately, we
stifled the desire to give 'em a

belt on the noggin. They looked
too big. Gentlemen, booing is
great when you're in the homo
town crowd. But in hostile sur
roundings your opinion of it
verges on disgust.
Harry Wolter has his troubles, too.
The latest scare is the possible in
eligibility of Stan Anderson, due to
scholastic failings.
On the Athens Club ball team
roster, are but two familiar
monickers, Norman "Axeman" Hor
ner. and Smith, who did fhe catch
ing for him during his college days.
The Athens Club plays the varsity
here this afternoon. R.D.W., Jr.
