# FROSH BASEBALL SQUAD TO TANGLE WITH SAN MATEO
## Babes Meet Peninsula High Tomorrow Morning in Season's Opener 
### 
Facing its first competition of the
'33 season, Coach Murray Cudde
back's freshman baseball team tan
gles with San Mateo High School at
10 o'clock tomorrow morning on the
frosh playing field. The contest
promises to be close, although both
teams wiil undoubtedly be handi
capped by lack of practice due to
the recent rains.
Cuddeback intends to use the
game as an opportunity to get a
better line on his players. Although
prospects seem bright for a good
team, he has not yet been able to
select any definite line-up. Several
men will probably see action at
various positions tomorrow and
Coach Cuddeback hopes to use
every one on the squad in the fray.
Due to the appearance of Elliott
Blanchard this week, the pitching
position seems to be well fortified.
Blanchard, a right-hander, hails
from Thatcher prep and should be
a big addition to the team. P'ran
ceschi, a southpaw, will probably
start tomorrow, although Blanchard
and Marshall will see service.
Completing tomorrow's opening
battery will be Oct Morgan, sturdy
backstop, who will be relieved by
Allen. Bobby Grayson, of football
fame, will hold down the first sack
and is also expected to do plenty of

damage with the willow.
Two good men are staging a neck
and-neck battle for the keystone
position. At the present time Monk
Moscrip, because of his superior hit
ting ability, is leading Frank Tre
maine by a hair. The latter, how- '
ever, holds the edge in fielding and I
undoubtedly will participate.
Yale has a $600 scholarship that
has never been applied for, due per- 1
haps to the fact that the applicant
must be named Leavenworth.
