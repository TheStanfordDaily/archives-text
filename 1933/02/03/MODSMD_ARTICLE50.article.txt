# BABE HOOPSTERS SLATED FOR SECOND U. C. WIN
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Unless pre-season form shown by
the two teams goes completely hay
wire before t»:30 o'clock tomorrow
night, Stanford's freshman basket
ball team will win the California
seriqg in two straight games. Jimmy
Bradshaw's Papooses scored a 40-30
victory in the first 1933 meeting be
tween the two teams.
Stanford's position tonight is a
novel one—usually the second game
of the Little Big Series finds the
score in games: California 1. Stan
ford o—with every indication that
the Bear Cubs would have no trou
ble in hammering out two more vic
tories.
But this time everything's rosy
(unless a spell of overconfidence hits
the Indian warriors). Stanford has
had fine material to use, and what is
even more important, has been
granted complete exemption from
the traditional injury jinx that has
beaten Indian teams in many previ
ous California contests.
California has also had fine ma
terial—enough prep stars to satisfy
any hoop coach's pipe dreams, but
the three best California centers
were on the injury list, while a
first-string guard, Ed Grey, was in

eligible.
Bui tomorrow's Stanford victory
(????) will be no easy one, if ac
complished at all. True, the Papoos
es outplayed California at every turn
in the first game of the series, but
it was high-scoring Adtlie Darnell
and a generally "hot" bunch of for
wards that accounted for most of
the Indian points NOT a superior
floor game.
Comparative scores during the last
week also point to a Stanford vic
tory. While California was losing to
St. Mary's Tuesday night, Stanford
outplayed and outshot Santa Clara.
But let's hope that Bradshaw's
players forget all about comparative
scores when they get on the floor
tomorrow night.
