# FROSH BARRISTERS HOLD STORMY TILT IN MOOT SESSION
## Bellows, Penfield Awarded Victory By Churchill In Mock Trial 
### 
A slow session featuring frequent
clashes between counsel and judge,
in which the judge always came out
I the victor, marked last night's
I Freshman Moot Court trial.
George Bellows and Louis Pen
field, in spite of frequent clashes
with Judge Perry Churchill, winner
of last year's moot court tourna
ment, won their case, which involved
a question of a man's right to re
| cover for services rendered when he
\ had broken the terms of a contract.
| They argued that he was a wrong
j doer and should receive no protec
tion at the hands of the law. Louis
| Bulasky and Bob Gahagan con
tended that he should be paid for
the work he did do.
Churchill pointed out that recov
ery would probably be allowed in a
i court of law, but that for purposes
of the trial, the decision must go to
the respondents. He explained that
the contract law is compensatory
and not intended to penalize.
Tonight's case between Munro
Redman and Eldon Lowe, against
Stanley Madden and John Pascoe,
I will be judged by Douglas Clark
Gregg, co-winner with Churchill of
last year's tournament moot court.
| The trial will be at 7:15 o'clock in
I the Law Building lecture room.
There are six major sports at Min
