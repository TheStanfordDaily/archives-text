# HANSON DECLARES LACK OF PICTURES ENDANGERS QUAD
## Studio Will Reopen Monday In Effort To Save Senior Section 
### 
Danger that the senior section of
the 1933 Quad might never get to
press, or that it might appear in
incomplete form, was declared im
minent last night by Kay Hanson,
editor.
"Too many members of the Class
of '33 have failed to come around
and have their pictures taken," Han
son declared. "We have decided to
open the studio once more for a
brief period, and if the response is
not satisfactory the book will fail
in its most important department."
The Quad Watson studio, located
at 520 Salvatierra, will open Mon
day. A photographer will be on duty
from 9 to 12 and from 1 to 4 o'clock.
Proofs of all photographs taken by
ihe studio cameras since last Octo
ber are now on hand at the above
address, and must be called for im
mediately, Hanson said.
