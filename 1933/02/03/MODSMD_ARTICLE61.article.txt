BERKELEY, Feb. 2 (PIP)-O. K.
McMurray, Dean of the University
of California College of Jurispru
dence, denounced the constitution
of the A.S.U.C. as weak. The refer
endum section of the constitution
was especially criticized by the dean.
"I suppose this Constitution was
drawn up by a group of student
politicians sitting around a fireplace
of some fraternity," said McMurray.
"I suppose you do need a new Con
stitution, but who has time to draw
up a new one?"
