# Eight Mitt Tossers Gain New Crowns In University Tourney
## Lanky Fowler Takes Middleweight Title in Mutt-Jeff Battle by Out-Reaching Stromquist; Glover Wins Lightweight With Old Form 
### 
Eight new Stanford boxing champions, serving notice of warning on
other Pacific Coast ring teams, were crowned last night at the all-
University championships in the Pavilion.
The new Indian titlcholdcrs are '•Bunny" Johnson, bantamweight; Jim
Feely, featherweight; Captain Fred Glover, lightweight; Bob Quinn, wel
terweight; Oscar Bacr, junior middleweight; John Fowler, middleweight;
Louis Ruschin, light-heavy; and Phil Johnston, heavyweight.
The outstanding bout on an extremely good card resulted in a decision
for John Fowler over Ebcn Stromquist for the middleweight title. In
Mutt and Jeff imitation, lanky Fowler, with a tremendous advantage in
reach, held! Stromquist ofT in the lirst round with a series of left jabs.
Stromquist came back in the second to bore in continually, punishing
Fowler with body blows. The third round had the fans yelling continually
as the lighters traded punches, Stromquist gaining a slight advantage

• with his boring-in tactics. Both men
were groggy but finished the round
with Fowler getting a close decision.
Oscar Baer Wins
Oscar Baer won the junior mid
dleweight crown with a technical
knockout in the third round over
Ira Jones. Baer came out of his cor
ner swinging to open the fight and
l'emained on the offensive the
greater part of the bout, landing a
knockdown punch in the first round.
Scoring a technical knockout in
the first round when he floored Stu
Stephens with a short left jab, Cap
tain Fred Glover won the light
weight championship and showed he
has lost none of the form that made
him one of the most-feared college
fighters on the coast two years ago.
Glover's comeback was most de
cisive, the boxer boring in from the
first and finishing the fight before
the first round was half over.
Smith Shows Class
Phil Johnston, heavyweight, fought
an exhibition bout with Phil Smith,
who won the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate heavyweight championship
while at Stanford last year. Smith's
greater experience allowed him to
outclass Johnston, although the lat
ter looked good enough to cause
other college boxers plenty of trou
ble in coming tournaments.
The featherweight crown went to
Jim Feely when he scored a tech
nical knockout over John Huston,
novice champion. Neither fighter
showed much in the opening round
but put on a fast second round, with
Feely landing the punch which fin
ished the bout near the end of the
canto.
Johnson in K.O.
Another technical knockout gave
"Bunny" Johnson the bantamweight
championship over Eugene Huggins
after two slow rounds. Bob Quinn
won the welterweight title in what
was to have been the feature bout
of the evening. However, doctor's
orders kept Waldo Munday, junior
Pacific Coast champion, out of the
ring. Newton Ridley subbed for him
and put up a good fight against the
stronger Quinn.
Miniature gold boxing gloves em
blematic of championships in vari
ous groups were awarded the win
ners by Leland W. Cutler, president
of the University Board of Trustees.
Myron Schall, boxing instructor, put
on a clever bag-striking and rope
skipping exhibition.
