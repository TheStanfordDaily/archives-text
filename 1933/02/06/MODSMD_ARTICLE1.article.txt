# PAPOOSES WIN THRILLER FROM BEARS, 30 TO 29
## Game Gives Stanford First Little Big Series Since 1929 GEORGE VIGUIE STARS Ralph Mannion Tanks Goal In Last 30 Seconds 
### Albert Guerard 
Fed since 1929 on the meagre de
pression fare of occasional victories
in high ' school games, Stanford's
freshman basketball players rose in
wrath Saturday night, hammered
out a 110-29 victory over California's
fast-improving yearlings, and there
by clinched the first Indian Little
Big Series victory in four long years.
Stanford's second consecutive vic
tory over the Bears was accom
plished in hair-raising fashion.
Forty-five seconds before the end
of the game, Harry Cordes had ap
parently given California a 29-28
victory, plunging the Stanford side
of the Pavilion into the silence of
utter despair. One-half minute to
go: Ralph Mannion streaked down
side court, sunk a set up shot, giv
ing Stanford a 30-29 lead. The last
twenty seconds of frenzied play were
scoreless.
Climax Passed
Though several games remain on
the freshman schedule, the season's
climax has been passed, and from
now on Jimmy Bradshaw will de
vote his time to developing inex
peric need players. No effort will be
made to win the third California
contest. Members of the yearling
squad who have faithfully turned
out for practice without any great
likelihood of ever getting to play '
will be given a chance to do some j
Bear scalping of their own and inci
dentally win their frosh numerals.
Realizing the hopelessness of try
ing to stop Art Nightingale, flashy j
Bear forward who raced the boards I
for nine field goals and eighteen j
points, Stanford's hitherto conserva- ;
live squad turned into a fast-break- j
ing machine Saturday. Ralph Man- i
nion and Addie Barnett played bril- j
liantly as they have done all season. |
hut George Vifiuie probably played i
the biggest part in the California j
victory. Viguie's seven points helped j
a lot, but his accurate passing and !
steady floor game were even more j
valuable.
Start Fas!
Stanford started fast and dead eye
shooting by Don Greenlee gave the
Papooses a 5-0 and then 7-3 lead !
which disappeared quickly as Cali- j
fornia's great Nightingale began J
dropping in shots from all sides. \
California led 15-9 at half time, j
Stanford overcame the Bear Cubs J
steadily in the second half, and j
Viguie's set-up with ten minutes to i
go tied the score at 21 all. From '
that point on, the game continued j
nip-and-tuck until the finish.
Stanford outclassed the Bertr Cubs ■
throughout. Only the play of Art !
Nightingale, who was worth two j
good men, kept California within j
shouting distance.

victory. Viguie's seven points helped j
a lot, but his accurate passing and !

valuable.
Start Fas!
Stanford started fast and dead eye
shooting by Don Greenlee gave the
Papooses a 5-0 and then 7-3 lead !
which disappeared quickly as Cali- j
fornia's great Nightingale began J
dropping in shots from all sides. \
California led 15-9 at half time, j
Stanford overcame the Bear Cubs J
steadily in the second half, and j
Viguie's set-up with ten minutes to i
go tied the score at 21 all. From '
that point on, the game continued j
nip-and-tuck until the finish.
Stanford outclassed the Bertr Cubs ■
throughout. Only the play of Art !
Nightingale, who was worth two j
good men, kept California within j
shouting distance.
Fed since 1929 on the meagre de
pression fare of occasional victories
in high ' school games, Stanford's
freshman basketball players rose in
wrath Saturday night, hammered
out a 110-29 victory over California's
fast-improving yearlings, and there
by clinched the first Indian Little
Big Series victory in four long years.
Stanford's second consecutive vic
tory over the Bears was accom
plished in hair-raising fashion.
Forty-five seconds before the end
of the game, Harry Cordes had ap
parently given California a 29-28
victory, plunging the Stanford side
of the Pavilion into the silence of
utter despair. One-half minute to
go: Ralph Mannion streaked down
side court, sunk a set up shot, giv
ing Stanford a 30-29 lead. The last
twenty seconds of frenzied play were
scoreless.
Climax Passed
Though several games remain on
the freshman schedule, the season's
climax has been passed, and from
now on Jimmy Bradshaw will de
vote his time to developing inex
peric need players. No effort will be
made to win the third California
contest. Members of the yearling
squad who have faithfully turned
out for practice without any great
likelihood of ever getting to play '
will be given a chance to do some j
Bear scalping of their own and inci
dentally win their frosh numerals.
Realizing the hopelessness of try
ing to stop Art Nightingale, flashy j
Bear forward who raced the boards I
for nine field goals and eighteen j
points, Stanford's hitherto conserva- ;
live squad turned into a fast-break- j
ing machine Saturday. Ralph Man- i
nion and Addie Barnett played bril- j
liantly as they have done all season. |
