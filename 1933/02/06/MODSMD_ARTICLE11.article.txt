# IBSEN TRAGEDY WILL BE NEXT CAMPUS DRAMA
## Tryoutees Must Report At 7:30 O'Clock Tonight In Little Theatre 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
With an about-face from the
gaiety of "Holiday," Harold Helven- j
ston announced that the next cam- j
pus play is to be Henrik Ibsen's ;
''An Enemy of the People," trvouts
for which will open tonight. Tryouts i
! will take place tonight in the Little j
Theatre, with all candidates sum- i
'moned for 7:30 o'clock. All are eli
gible except freshman women and'
members of the cast of "Holiday."
Many Roles
The play provides opportunity for !
a number of roles, with many "bit" !
parts as well as principal roles. |
There are nine substantial male
parts and two excellent female
characters.
"An Enemy of the People" is a
four-act tragi-comedy first per- .
formed in Denmark in 1882. It was :
written by Ibsen immediately fol- |
lowing his famous "Ghosts," sue- <
cessfully presented as a Sword and !
Sandals reading last quarter.
Ibsen's answer to the accusation >
that he was condemning society in '
his "Ghosts" is found in "An Enemy i
of the People," in which the central
character is Dr. Stockmann, a" man 1
who searches after truth. The play !
is also a refutation of Bjornson's j
contention that the majority is al- j
ways right.
Obvious Lesson
Unlike many who write with a
definite purpose, Ibsen does not :
choose to hide the lesson he aims to |
point, but rather, he glories in hav
ing this lesson. And thus it is that j
his plays are dramatic tours de j
force. This "father of the modern |
drama" has also written "A Doll's j
House," "Brand," "Pillars of So- '
ciety," "Hedda Cabler," "The Wild j
Duck," and "Peer Gynt."
"An Enemy of the People" will be [
the first Ibsen to be seen on the j
Assembly Hall stage sincc the pre- j
sentation, four years ago, of the
drama, 'The Wild Duck."
