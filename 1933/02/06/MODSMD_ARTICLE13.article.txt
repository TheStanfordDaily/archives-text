# Dating Cheap At Munich; Frauleins Share Expense
## 
### BY ROBERT MYNARD 
A university where the most ex
pensive date costs only 49 cents,
where the dinner involved in a din
ner dance is brought from home in
waxed paper, where the rumble
seat is unknown, and where the fair
sex foots one-half of the bill every
time —that's the University of Mu
nich in Southern Germany.
John D. Peck, '32. attending the
German institution as a guest stu
dent during the past, few months,
reports that the most handsome ges
ture a Munich man can make is to
escort his date to a beer garden,
order two steins of beer, and dance
with her until midnight to the mu
sic of a poor carbon copy of an
American jazz band.
The beer costs 25 cents, and the
carfare, which the fraulein gladl}'
pays, amounts to 24 cents. Only the
wealthiest students drive cars.

It is thought to be improper to
order dinner at the beer gardents
or at the many cabarets in the Ba
varian city. Drinks are purchased
but the food, usually sandwiches,
comes from the pantry at home.
Informality prevails at all the beer
gardens. Stranger dances with
stranger and no man feels affronted
when an unknown waltzes off with
his companion. It's all a part of the
fun.
Munich's modernistic picture
palaces atti'act the students who are
roughing it. German-made pictures
are appreciated and well attended,
but it is the Glamorous Swede that
causes the most hearts to throb, the
most exes to be flunked, and the
most money to be laid down at the
box office. Mickey Mouse and Flip
the Frog follow closely behind
1 Garbo as money makers,
