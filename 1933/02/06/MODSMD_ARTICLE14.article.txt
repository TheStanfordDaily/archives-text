# Moonlit Nights; Roughs, Wimmen Trek To Lagunita
## 
### 
Moonlit nights, and brilliant
canoes, and Roble and Row,
and Lagunitaâ€”the scene is all
set.
Swains and their fair ones
flocked to the lake over the
week-end with the opening
Saturday of the boathouse.
Coining so late in the year, the
local rendezvous of lovelorn
mariners should last a consid
erable while even without fur
ther rain.
Tentative plans call for the
discontinuance of the swim
ming test because of the diffi
culty of enforcing it, Comptrol
ler Roth said last night. To
prevent accidents, however,
each canoe will be required to
carry two life preservers.
