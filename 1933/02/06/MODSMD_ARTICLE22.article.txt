# Stanford Five Fails To Foil Nemesis As U.C. Triumphs 28-18
## Tight Defense That Holds Cardinals To Four Goals Decides Game; Keith Topping Ejected With Four Fouls; Eifert High Scorer 
### BOB LETTS 
The worm that was supposed to turn wore a corset hove Saturday night,
| and as a result California's basketball team walked oh' with its twelfth
annual Big Series when it played a marvelous brand of defensive ball to
j take the Stanford five into camp, 28 to 18.
It was a case of too much defense—one that held a promising Stanford
team to four goals from the field—that spelled defeat for Coach John

* Bunn's Indians and kept California
in position to threaten University
of California's conference-leading
quintet.
U.S.C, won another battle from
U.C.L.A. over the week-end by a
score of 38 to 33.
Cards Throw Ball Away
California's defense spread all
over the floor when the occasion
demanded it Saturday evening.
Even after Stanford gained posses
sion of the casaba, the blue and
gold cagers—principally the great
Hal Eifert and Captain Jack Read
tied ilp the Cardinal offense before
it was able to get under way. The
result was enough bad passes on
Stanford's part to last the Cards for
the balance of the season.
For soma reason or other, Stan
ford STILL looks potentially strong
enough defeat California. One
chance remains, February 25, when
the finel game of this year's series
will be played at Berkeley.
Had the Indians been more active
in getting the ball out to the for
wards to start a fast-breaking of
fensive, things could have been
much different. Because the men
failed to move around sufficiently,
U.C.'s men were able to gum up the
works.
Teams Equal First Half
Despite the 17 to 7 half-time score,
both teams were on a par in the
first period. Stanford was held 1"
one field goal, that 011 a long shot by
John Hancock after 14 minutes of
play, but there was no real margin
between leader and trailer. Stanford
entered the second half with as good
a chance to win as it had when the
game opened.
But it didn't take long for things
to change. Keith Topping, Coach
Bunn's prize sophomore center, went
out for committing too many per
sonal fouls, and Had Edelen wasn't.

off form for the first time this year.
The rest of the Indians, principally
Hancock and Jay Tod, played good
defensive ball, but were too slow
moving down the court. Hancock
played a steady brand of ball from
start to finish. He deserved the big
hand he got when he left near the
end of the game.

U.C.L.A. over the week-end by a
score of 38 to 33.
Cards Throw Ball Away
California's defense spread all
over the floor when the occasion
demanded it Saturday evening.
Even after Stanford gained posses
sion of the casaba, the blue and
gold cagers—principally the great
Hal Eifert and Captain Jack Read
tied ilp the Cardinal offense before
it was able to get under way. The
result was enough bad passes on
Stanford's part to last the Cards for
the balance of the season.
For soma reason or other, Stan
ford STILL looks potentially strong
enough defeat California. One
chance remains, February 25, when
the finel game of this year's series
will be played at Berkeley.
Had the Indians been more active
in getting the ball out to the for
wards to start a fast-breaking of
fensive, things could have been
much different. Because the men
failed to move around sufficiently,
U.C.'s men were able to gum up the
works.
Teams Equal First Half
Despite the 17 to 7 half-time score,
both teams were on a par in the
first period. Stanford was held 1"
one field goal, that 011 a long shot by
John Hancock after 14 minutes of
play, but there was no real margin
between leader and trailer. Stanford
entered the second half with as good
a chance to win as it had when the
game opened.
But it didn't take long for things
to change. Keith Topping, Coach
Bunn's prize sophomore center, went
out for committing too many per
sonal fouls, and Had Edelen wasn't.

off form for the first time this year.
The rest of the Indians, principally
Hancock and Jay Tod, played good
defensive ball, but were too slow
moving down the court. Hancock
played a steady brand of ball from
start to finish. He deserved the big
hand he got when he left near the
end of the game.
