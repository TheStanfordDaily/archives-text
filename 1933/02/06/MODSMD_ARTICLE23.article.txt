# 'Holiday' Wins Curtain Calls From Audience
## Marian Jones, Mary Anita Loos Vie For Honors 
### Abe Mellinkoff 
In a wave of laughter—ranging
from titters to guffaws—Philip
! Barry's "Holiday" was carried to
{ campus approval and half a dozen
j curtain calls last Friday night. Thus
proving again that it is the unsym
bolical, unphilosophical, the simple
and the funny that appeals to Stan
ford audiences. Harold Helvenston's
version, different from the film, was
' still two hours' fun, fast-moving and
| convincing.
Marian Jones and Mary Anita
Loos fought for the sympathy of
the audience. Loos had the edge for
I two rounds but finally took off her
; exciting salmon-colored evening
| gown, and in the third act the Em
-1 press Jones came into her rightful
! own.
The Empress made Linda a bit
j boisterous—more grown-up tomboy
fun and less sympathy than Barry
intended. But it was her show, and
it was the Jones profile, the Jones
j manner, the Linda lines that won
J for her two solo curtain calls—a
rare thing in these parts. Always
good to look upon, and with con
j stantly improving stage technique,
! Miss Loos is scheduled for further
roles.
Bob Churchill was the laugh
storm of the sh'ow, and his story
of how he made the "bottle" a na
tional institution rolled them pretty (
; near the aisles. Despite an occa
| sional unfortunate lapse into the
! manner-Chaparral, Churchill's Nick
| Potter was an outstanding portrayal.
As his foil in fun, Elizabeth
J Chapin proves that she deserves an
| other larger part in the very near
! future. She rollicked her role with a
| gusto matching Churchill's.
Joe Wolf continued with his magic
j transforming lemon roles into dra
-1 matic plums. And a special boquet
| for his nonchalance when a box ol'
! matches he was using burst into
i flames and drew a distracting gig
' gle from the audience. Wolf would
! be more sonorous in these old-men
| roles if he carried more weight
j around the midriff.
There were two young men—John
' Peckham and James Benet. Benet's
Johnny Case was supposed to have
| great personal magnetism but un
j fortunately Benet Hashed his wide
! smiles on and off with the regularity
i and precision of a camera shutter,
j Peckham was better, really conviric
j ing as the half-stewed brother of
J Linda Seton.
| The impossible Crams were made
1 duly impossible by Carter Meyer
I and Eleanor Furst. The inevitable
j silent servants were on hand with
j Eleanor Harris, Balcom Moore, and
! Will Williams, the latter looking
: more like a butler than any butler
I ever seen.
Well, everyone's monicker has i
j been given space except Frederick
Stover, who designed both sets.
