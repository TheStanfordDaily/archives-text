# A 						SOCK FOR THE GOOSE

It's disgusting, and alarming the hold that Hollywood,
the non-geographic, has upon the fancy and fashion of
prosaic, unimaginative America. The latest demonstration
of this Hollywood influence is most disgusting of all.
It seems lh.it Marlcnc Dietrich, who has forgotten that
her reputation as an actress can he traced to a dazzling,
generous display of legs early in her film career, appears
in public these days garbed for all Ihe world to see as a
man. She wears Ihe pants, Ihe shirt, the vest, Ihe coal, Ihe
cravat, the topcoat, even (her press agents claim) Ihe
iinderthings of a man. Iler hat alone is feminine, or at
least exoticallv uninasculine.
And women have taken up the fad.. Women's haber
dashers have anyway, even in conservative San Francisco.
They are advertising tailored suits for women, with one
pair - of trousers and one skirl, and out-of-work stenogra
phers have posed in them for newspaper photographers.
Lots of women, undoubtedly, have two good reasons
for desiring trousers as a conventional piece of feminine
apparel. Everyone knows that Marlcnc Dietrich hasn't.
What's Ihe point to Ihe whole thing then? Publicity, of
course. The publicity succeeded, bill il has had pernicious
results. Dietrich started Ihe whole thing bv wanting to
look like ;i man. Some irate male ought to punch her nose
in ;i Hollywood street light, and in true manly fashion.
