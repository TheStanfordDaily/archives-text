It is bad theory to have gold flow
ing into the country—yet all nations
seek to grab it. It is bad theory to
have tariffs, yet all countries have
tariffs. II i.s bad theory to have a
favorable balance or trade yet every
nation breaks its neck to get a fa
forable balance. Similarly, it is bad
theory 1o collect our foreign debts,
but I am for not canceling our debts.
The sums seem tremendous. In
comparison to the yearly income of
a ribbon clerk, the debt i.s gigantic.
But it is only 5 per cent of the total
budgets of the debtor nations. There
seems to be no reason to believe
that that five per cent will put Eu
rope in a hole.
When we consider the huge
amounts that these nations spend
on armaments, il is not had 1o con
ceive of their paying their debts to
us. And it looks like armaments will
increase—due no doubt to the dis
armament conferences that have
been sweeping the newspapers re
cently and not so recently.
It may he necessary to issue
quasi-moratoriums during this de
pression but that is no reason for
canceling the debts permanently. Of
course, debts cannot be paid out of
nothing. As soon as stocks begin
rising, lowa and Missouri will once
more move to Paris bars. We will
drink Europe into financial ability.
Painless taxation; or taxation ac
cording to a capacity (to drink).
Furthermore, we can use these
debts as a lever on Europe. By
brandishing these debts around, we
may be able to force some kind of
genuine disarmament on Europe. By
themselves, it seems that they are
doomed to mounting armaments and
mounting debts. This i.s not pure
altruism on our part. For if Europe
disarms—at least dis-navies, if will
be a weight off our backs.
Of course, the blood and thunder
nationalists scream payment in such
blantant manners that many are
afraid to join with them in the fight
against cancellation. But the facts
remain. We think in theories and
act by facts. The facts demand pay
ment.
Europe owes America millions in
private debts and millions in public
debts. No one ever mentions a can-

WE WON'T CANCEI

cellation of these private debts. The ,
House of Morgan would suffer con- j
niptions at the very thought. The j
American Senate will probably be ]
no more relenting and it deserves j
credit—event though the only rea- j
son they are so persistent in de- i
manding payment is the fact that j
political-suicide awaits any senator |
who even whispers "cancellation."
It is not as simple as Coolidge put !
it: "They borrowed the money." ]
Tariffs may have to be modified; but j
total cancellation or drastic reduc- J
lion is unnecessary.
