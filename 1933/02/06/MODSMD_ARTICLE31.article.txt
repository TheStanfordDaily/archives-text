SHE DONE HIM WRONG (Para
mount) — V( the Stanford Theatre. |
This might have been no more 1
than a repetition of that aging ballad j
of the gilt-caged bird or that con
cerning the prostitute with a heart j
of gold. Bui Mae West allows no
sentimentalily to creep into her por- |
trait of Diamond LiJ, a hard, selfish,]
practical fancy woman.
Disregarding a not badly melo- '
dramatic plot, the barroom atmos
phere has been well recaptured. But
that is only the setting for the sul
phuric Lil. Mao West, is probably
not capable of many roles; but in
this one I know no one who excels
her. The Bowery nasals, the defiant
coolness which breaks frequently
into an acid wit, the movement of
body all make her the woman who,
without an illusion, seeks pleasure
\n more tangible possessions than a
,>,OU I.
I
Diamond Li! may be compared and
contracted with Gar bo's Mala Hari:
both arc disillusioned women. But
whereas Garbo'.s portrait was in
tensely tragic that of Mae West is
comic, vulgaiized and frankly,
whole-heartedly so. 1! never leers.
The plot of Mat a Hari, the few I
times that it became apparent, |
seemed shoddy, immaterial. And in
that was a proper background for
the lonely figure which passed i
through it, indifferent and unmoved, i
Li I, on the other hand, is incapable
of great emotions; she desires only
pleasure and life—and the latter the
more. Her apparent indifference to
the occurrences of the melodrama is,
therefore, only a well-made mask.
Her calm breaks only once or twice.
"She Done Him Wrong," an im
proved version of Diamond Li 1, is
by no means a fine film; it is merely
an amusing, well-drawn portrait,
placed before a good background.
The shooting is merely by way of
suspense. -—Sandoe
A total ol 18,350 deer were killed
