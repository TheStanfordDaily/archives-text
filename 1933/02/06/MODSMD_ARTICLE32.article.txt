LET'S TURN OUT THE LIGHTS
"RENO The huge sign on Main
street proclaiming Reno Iho "biggest
little city in the world" is blazing
its boast no more. Reluctantly, the
cily council decided that until times
are better, the lights that illuminate
the sign must be turned out to re
duce expenses and meet a serious
deficit in the city treasury."—S.F.
Examiner.
Moral: Time to clamp down when
the white light of Main Street burns
in the red.

Edinburgh are fined a six-pence for
