FOR A BETTER SHOW

, The Editor, Sir:
I read with enthusiasm the head
lines in Thursday's Daily which an
nounced the selection of a men's
Hi-Jinx as the spring campus show;
it sounded like a grand idea. Then
later I read the accompanying arti
cle, . and what was my amazement
and chagrin to find that the plan,
as outlined in the paper, was for
nothing but a Junior Opera, the only
diffewnce being that this year the
cast will be all masculine, and the
work won't be called a Junior Opera.
After all, what was the objection
to the Junior Opera? It didn't make
money, or it wasn't good enough;
something like that, at any rate. I'll
have to admit that an all men's pro
duction isn't so bad, but as for qual
ity, where will this have the advan
tage over any musical opera given
in the past. As far as I can see, the
contest rules are very similar to
those held for the opera last year.
The play's authorship is limited to
two collaborators, but two people
can't write a capable piece of work
in such a short time. Even our cele
brated New York contemporaries in
the musical comedy field allow
themselves more time than this in
preparation. Here at Stanford, we
have to write the script, the music,
and rehearse the show all in a period
which is less than three months.
I suggest no alternative for the
Hi-Jinx; an all men's show will
have a decided audience appeal. It
is merely in the method of writing
land selecting this production that 1
wish to offer an idea. Since we have
writing talent on this campus, make
use of all Stanford writers, and let
them work together on this show?
Allow a period of two weeks,
maybe three, for the selection of a
theme or outline. Then issue a call
for volunteers who think themselves
' capable of writing good music,
'lyrics, and situations. With different

people working on separate sections
of the production, under the super
vision of Harold Helvenston, they
would be able to give detailed at
tention to their own particular as
signmnt, and should produce the
best of which they are capable.
The production might lack unity
of style, but, after all, a musical
production is certainly not meant to
be a dramatic masterpiece, and if
a suitable sustaining plot is selected,
goifld situations will easily carry the
show.
I offer this suggestion, because
I think this plan is better and
would produce a better show, which
is, after all, what we are all striving
for. I sincerely hope that, if nothing
else, this idea will receive immedi
ate consideration.
Respectfully submitted,
Maurice Rapf, '35
