STANFORD HAS NEVER LOST
to California in 18 years of varsity
water polo. And next Saturday af
ternoon in Enema Pools these two
old rivals meet again with Stanford
favored as usual.
Games in the newly formed
Northern California Water Polo As
sociation have brought out the fact
that the Indians have what is un
doubtedly the best team in the his
tory of the University.
Most of the credit for the Cards'
phenomenal showing goes to Assist
ant Coach Nort Thornton. He .started
building up for this year's aggrega
tion when he saw last year's fresh
man material. He went to the Olym
pic Games and studied the reasons
for Hungary's success at the game.
When he returned to Stanford this
year he used the first thing that he
learned by giving the Indian team a
new attack and a new defense. That
both were good is shown by the fact
that Stanford beat the Olympic Club
septet 8-4 with substitutes in for
three of the Club goals, and then
the Athens Club 5-2.
Then he tried the second idea that
he picked up in Los Angeles. He
was instrumental in forming Ihe
N.C.W.P.A. He had decided that ii

Hungary could have a lot of water
polo teams all over the country, so
could California. That worked too.
Nice work, Nort. Keep it up!
THE SUCCESS OF THE BOX
ING BOUTS Thursday night
was borne out by (he size of the
crowd. All that we can think of
to add is: why not have more of
them? A few good bouts added
to those already shown and you
would have a real drawing card,
Coach Maloney!
OF ALL THE PRIZE BASKET
BALL games that we have seen
around here, Saturday night's pair
certainly carry off any and all
prizes.
The freshman game was a thriller
from start to finish, and the Cards
cinched the first series that they
have won in some time. Those
youngsters play as if they really
know what the game is all about. If
they continue to improve, Stanford
may some day have a little material
for Coach Bunn to work with.
The varsity battle was probably
the deadest game imaginable in any
language. The boys tried hard
enough, but there just wasn't any
thing there. —Bob Wade
