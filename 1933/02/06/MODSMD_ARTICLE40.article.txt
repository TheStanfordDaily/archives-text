WRIGLEY FIELD, Los Angeles,
Feb. 5 (/P) â€”Southern Californians
who like their college football,
watched in amazement today as the
Green Bay Packers professional
team put on a remarkable exhibi
tion of passing to defeat an all-star
eleven 19 to 6 before 10,000 persons.
The invaders tossed passes with
abandon, with one Arnold Herber
doing most of the throwing. Two of
the three touchdowns which came
(ne each in the first three periods
fere directly the result of forward
tosses.
