# ATHENIAN NINE ROUTS SPOTTY CARDS, 6 TO 2
## Campbell, Estes, Heringer In Box For Stanford; Errors Hurt 
### 
Playing spotty ball, and weaken
ing when it meant runs, Stanford's
varsity baseball nine went down to
defeat before the hard-hitting Ath
ens Club team 6-2 on the Sunken
Diamond Saturday afternoon.
For the first three innings all went
well, with Coach „Wolter's new
southpaw, Lefty Campbell, pitching
his first innings for a Stanford var
sity and holding the visitors to a
scratch single. But when Herm
Estes, who followed Campbell on
the mound in the fourth, began
dropping them too near the groove,
the Club nine forged into a lead
which they never relinquished.
Three in Seventh
The Athens Club scored in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth frames, and
topped it off with a three-run rally
in the seventh. Three of the six
runs, however, were unearned, so
they really deserved a 3-2 decision.
Fred Heringer, who relieved Estes
at the start of the eighth frame,
pitched nice ball, holding the visi
tors scoreless.
Stanford collected a marker in
the seventh, and another in the
ninth, largely as a result of some
timely hitting on the part of Jerry
Trautman, veteran third-sacker.
Woolley Plays Second
Wolter trotted out a new second
baseman in the person of Jim Wool
ley, captain of last year's frosh ag
gregation, and the youngster looked
like a potential regular. He and
Mallatratt both drove out a couple
of long flies that may predict useful
hits later in the season.
Aside from second base, which is
still wide open, Wolter's worries
seem to be merely a matter of prac
tice and exprience. The material is
there, and work only is needed to
make Stanford's 1933 outfit a real
pennant contender.
