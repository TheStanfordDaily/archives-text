# CARD CAGEMEN PREPARING FOR S.C. TILTS HERE NEXT WEEK-END
## Stanford Hoping To Break Bear Jinx With Win Over Trojans 
### DICK STROUSE 
The energetic tse-tse ily, that i
spreads a disease known as sleeping J
sickness and that sporadically at- j
tacks the Stanford boys whenever
they are going to play at basketball |
with California, has hibernated until
the next game with California so i
that the Stanford team is again in i
health and can prepare strenuously i
for their two-game series with j
Southern California this week-end. [
Sleepy Five
The Stanford boys play fair to j
middlin' or better basketball when j
the pesky tse-tse fly leaves them j
alone, but they are quite helpless in j
their weakened sleepy condition'
when they play the California boys, j
The games with Southern Calif or- j
na put the Stanford boys in a most j
difficult quandary. They cannot de
feat the Southern California boys >
and retain their fair reputation for j
good sportsmanship, because if they j
dared such a sacrilegious thing, they
would be accused of helping the ]
California boys win the champion- j
ship at basketball. Nor can they lose j
to the Southern California boys, be- j
cause if they dared such a common- j
place thing, they would' be accused I
of being conventional.
Trust to Luck
The Stanford boys have therefore |
decided to trust to the luck of the '
game, which is a sportsmanlike way j
of playing basketball even if the j
luck of the game has a permanent J
residence near Los Angeles. The j
Stanford boys are sure to keep on j
trying, as they have all year, and to !
pray each night that they will re- j
member some of the things that |
their coach has taught them.
Their coach, who is himself a fine j
sportsman and does not gripe or!
moan about losses, was teaching the j
Stanford boys things last night. He j
was teaching them to break with j
great rapidity for the basket, and j
also to try to elude rather than run j
into opposing guards. Of course, the j
coach has been teaching them such ;
things all year, but the Stanford ;
boys figure to remember them this |
week-end in their games with the j
Southern California boys—from Los j
Angeles.
