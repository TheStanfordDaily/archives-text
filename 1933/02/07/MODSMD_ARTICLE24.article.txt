A blonde, chocolate-loving orphan
wUh a devil's smile: such would be
a composite picture of the Stanford
woman's ideal husband.
Prominent campus women gave
their answers yesterday to the im
portant questionâ€”what are you
looking for in a mate?
Barbara Binns, official of the
Y.W.C.A., wants "someone who will
cook all the meals and won't burn
the coffee."
Emily Ross, president of Roble,
says: "My ideal mate must be an
orphan because I don't want to be
bothered with in-laws; and he ab
solutely must liko chocolate in all
forms."
"An angel with a devil's smile" is
demanded by actress Barbara Col
lins.
Marion Hewlett, queen of last
year's Masque Ball, says: "My hus

band must be, in looks, between
Charles dc Bretteville and Harold
Helvenston, in personality between
Winstead Weaver and Philip Gar
nier, in size between Ike Livermore
and Tommy Cordry, and in intelli
gence between Abe Mcllinkoff and
Bill Corbus."
"I'm not looking for a mate," an
nounces Jeanne Millard, A.S.S.U. of
ficial, "and the reason is that I've
already found one: a perfect blend
between scholar and athlete. And
he's blond."
Marion Jones, star of "Holiday,"
claims: "My ideal man is one who
rolls his toothpaste up from the bot
tom, doesn't read the newspaper at
the table, and doesn't come home to
lunch. I'm going to line up all the
applicants for husband and have
them all break their teeth; the one
that is least obnoxious in the pro
cess, r'ets the job."
