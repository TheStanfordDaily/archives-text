BERLIN, Feb. G (/P)—Chancellor
Adolf Hilter's new government to
day swept aside all barriers that
had blocked its plans for the elec
tion of a new Prussian Diet at the
same time that the entire nation, is
choosing a new Reichstag next
month.
Tlie government accomplished this
end with the aid of President von
Hindenburg who ousted Otto Braun,
the elected premier of Prussia, and
vested his powers in Vice-Chancel
lor Franz Von Papen, who js the
federal commissioner for the state.
This accomplished, Lieutenant
Colonel Von Papen and Hans Kerrel,
the Nazi president of the Diet, voted
for dissolution of the legislature over
the objections of Conrad Adenauer,
president of the Prussian State
Council and third member of the
Diet triumvirate.
Last week the Diet itself and the
Diet triumvirate—on which Premier
Braun then sat—rejected a dissolu
tion demand from the federal gov
ernment. Under the Prussian con
stitution the triumvirate alone may
vote dissolution, and that end was
gained by ousting Braun and putting
in his place Von Papen.
