: head freshman football coach here
last season, will assist "Pop" Warner
I in his new job at Temple University,
1 Philadelphia, it was announced yes
i terday by Earl R. Yoemans, gradu
ate manager at Temple, according to
I Associated Press dispatches.
With Winterburn will be Fred
; Swan, Stanford guard and captain
!of 1926, who will be line coach.
; Swan has been head freshman coach
at University of Wisconsin since
1931, having previously assisted
( Andy Kerr at Colgate and acted as
I head coach of the Burlingame High
j School eleven.
Miller to Remain
Heinie Miller, head coach at Teni
! pie for the last seven years, who
I was retained by the university for
i one year in any capacity desired by
Warner, has been designated as ad
! visory coach and head scout. He may
I also help coach the ends.
Winterburn, like Swan, played
j under Warner. He was an all-round
: player at Pittsburgh University be
| fore "Pop" came West and has been
! on the Stanford coaching staff for
I the last seven years. Until last sea
son he was backfield coach here,
i The departure of Winterburn from
i the coaching staff here, although ex-
J pected, leaves the coming appoint
ment of assistants to C. E. ("Tiny")
Thornhill, new gridiron mentor of
the Indians, a fairly wide-open af
fair. Only one appointment, that of
| Ernie Nevers as backfield coach and
chief assistant to Thornhill, has been
definitely decided and made public.
B.A.C. Meets Friday
J Friday evening the Board of Ath
letic Control will convene for dinner
in the Old Union and then move to
i the B.A.C. offices to hear the report
I of the staff committee on the recom
' mendations for assistants made to
j the board by Thornhill.
Two principal positions are open—
the head freshman coach's job and
1 that of varsity end coach, a new job
here being created by Thornhill,
; who will handle the line in general
| in addition to acting as head coach.
While results tomorrow night
must still be approved, the B.A.C.
'selections have always been tanta
mount to hiring. The board of trus
| tees must put its official stamp on
! the matter before new positions ure
actually filled.
