# FOR PANHELLENIC

### 
Panhellenic mcl Itisl night and worked oul a plan to|
improve women's rushing rides. Thai plan is lo appoint a!
eonuuitlee ot lliree, which will consider suggestions audi
Ihen reporl hack al some future dale.
Along just what lines the commillee will work is, of;
course, as yet undecided. However, il is logical to suppose'
I hat this group w ill revise the rules so that they will better!
accomplish their purpose. Judging from the present set of
regulations, that purpose is lo prevent sororities l'roni rush-!
ing and to keep freshmen women from finding out that they i
are being rushed.
Xever doubling thai Panhellenic is a capable body wilh
no mean executive ability, the I )aii.y nevertheless has taken
considerable interest in the Great Problem, and therefore j
lcels that il ought not lo miss out on any of the fun. Kverv-I
one else, realizing also that Panhellenic will, in the end, do
absolutely nothing, is going to be offering ideas. So how
about these to make the barrier between Roble and Row
even more effective:
"1. Sorority girls shall wear no flashy nail polish during
rushing. Red and Green are explicitly forbidden, while
certain shades ot orange may he worn only wilh special
permission of two sponsors belonging to other sororities.
"2. Xo freshman woman may accept a date with any I
man during the rushing season until that man has been
cross-examined as to his 'intentions" by sponsors represent-1
ing not less than three sororities.
Sorority girls must reporl to Panhellenic the num-j
her and names of any freslunen they might have seen on
llie campus or in Palo Alto during the rushing season.
"I. Sororities must guard against the freshman's finding'
oul the Greek letter name of any particular group, the!
penally for violation being a reduction of courses in rush
ing dinners from the regulation three, to two."
