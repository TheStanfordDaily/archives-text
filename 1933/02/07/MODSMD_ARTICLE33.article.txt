# SOMETHING NEW IN CRIME
## 
### 
I
Los Angeles Mild vicinity was shocked yesterday I>y the,
disappearance and asserted kidnaping of Mary H. Skeelc,
wile of the dean of music at I lie t'nivcrsitv of Southern
( alitorma. (.crlainly I lie mystery is something entirely
new in criminal activity, involving, as it docs, a ransom!
letter the words of which had heen clipped from Trojan
student publications and pasted together.
According to wire dispatches, the 1,.A. police are basing!
their search for the missing woman and her abductors on
the theory that the crime has been committed by a group
ol amateur kidnapers, possibly S.(l. students. It wouldn't
lake an S.S. YaiiDinc to remark that the theory adopted
by the police is 100 obvious, that it is the theory which Mrs.
Skeele's abductors wished the police 4o adopt.
Surely, it the police theory is correct, the crime repre
sents an innovation in campus racketeering. College-man, j
bootleggers and peddlers of obscene literature are reeog- i
nized and well-established evils. Hut kidnaping somehow j
that crime is unthinkable of a group of college undcrgradu- i
ales. Xot impossible, of course, bill unthinkable.
More likely, the police are on the wrong track not llial 1
it matters, for kidnaping seems to be the hardest of all!
crimes to detect. It is very unlikely, however, that college!
men, at Southern California or any university, would leave j
clues which point so obviously to their identities.
Although kidnaping, most ruthless of all criminal prac
tices, has struck within the college, police would probably!
arrive at a solution much sooner in a thorough investigation
of underworld circles.
