# BULL SESSION
## THE 						VICTOR NEEDS THE SPOILS 
### 
Too honest to weasel, too brave
to see the need for it, Andrew Jack
son once said: "To the victors be
long the spoils." Because he had the
visceral virility to express in words
what had been going on ever since,
he is branded as the father of the
"Spoils System."
And every freshman knows that
the giving of governmental jobs to
political friends is a sinister ogre in
the national closet. It is unfair to
hold Jackson as the father of the
child in the cast. But those who are
wagging their fingers in his direction
may be sorry as well as mistaken.
Spoils are necessary in our system
and to be father of the "immoral"
political foundling may some day be
recognized as an honor.
If anything is to bo done in a bi
partisan system, the President must
sit on Congress- which is as uncom
fortable as a kitchen stove at noon.
The seat can be cooled only by sat
isfying Congressmen; and the way
to satisfy Congressmen is not to be
mild but to be generous. Give them
jobs to burn—give them spoils to
shower.
A national political party is a
loose aggregation of historical war
crys and hungry politicians. Anyone
can scream the crys. The politicians
must be fed. The best illustration is
the Roosevelt Administration. Thoy
seem to be sincerely trying to do
something. But what Roosevelt and

his "brain trust" may want to do
is one thing. The more important
thing is what Democrats in Congress
will do.
Roosevelt may want a new deal
but many Democrats are willing to
stand pat and call the President's
hand. There is only one way to
change their mind; and honest argu
ment isn't that way. These can
tankerous Democrats can't be led to
the Presidential trough but they can
be fed so full of pork and gravy
they will curl up and vote the
Rooseveltian way. That is the Presi
dent-elect's only hope.
Every Democrat is a leader and
the first principle "of all leaders is
that they will not be led. Without
thousands of jobs to hand out, the
new Administration would be on
the rocks before it was launched. In
fact, without jobs, there probably
wouldn't be any new administration
—ever.
Gravy is a very messy substance—
especially the thick stuff that the
Federal government has long been
in the habit of handing out. In the
ladling out of this choice delicacy
j will lie the future of Roosevelt and
1 his new deal. The Ship of State is
to be launched on a sea of political
gravy—sad and true.
Long live the "spoils system."
The victor can't live without them.

be fed so full of pork and gravy
they will curl up and vote the
Rooseveltian way. That is the Presi
dent-elect's only hope.
Every Democrat is a leader and
the first principle "of all leaders is
that they will not be led. Without
thousands of jobs to hand out, the
new Administration would be on
the rocks before it was launched. In
fact, without jobs, there probably
wouldn't be any new administration
—ever.
Gravy is a very messy substance—
especially the thick stuff that the
Federal government has long been
in the habit of handing out. In the
ladling out of this choice delicacy
j will lie the future of Roosevelt and
1 his new deal. The Ship of State is
to be launched on a sea of political
gravy—sad and true.
Long live the "spoils system."
The victor can't live without them.

Too honest to weasel, too brave
to see the need for it, Andrew Jack
son once said: "To the victors be
long the spoils." Because he had the
visceral virility to express in words
what had been going on ever since,
he is branded as the father of the
"Spoils System."
And every freshman knows that
the giving of governmental jobs to
political friends is a sinister ogre in
the national closet. It is unfair to
hold Jackson as the father of the
child in the cast. But those who are
wagging their fingers in his direction
may be sorry as well as mistaken.
Spoils are necessary in our system
and to be father of the "immoral"
political foundling may some day be
recognized as an honor.
If anything is to bo done in a bi
partisan system, the President must
sit on Congress- which is as uncom
fortable as a kitchen stove at noon.
The seat can be cooled only by sat
isfying Congressmen; and the way
to satisfy Congressmen is not to be
mild but to be generous. Give them
jobs to burn—give them spoils to
shower.
A national political party is a
loose aggregation of historical war
crys and hungry politicians. Anyone
can scream the crys. The politicians
must be fed. The best illustration is
the Roosevelt Administration. Thoy
seem to be sincerely trying to do
something. But what Roosevelt and

his "brain trust" may want to do
is one thing. The more important
thing is what Democrats in Congress
will do.
Roosevelt may want a new deal
but many Democrats are willing to
stand pat and call the President's
hand. There is only one way to
change their mind; and honest argu
ment isn't that way. These can
tankerous Democrats can't be led to
the Presidential trough but they can
be fed so full of pork and gravy
they will curl up and vote the
Rooseveltian way. That is the Presi
dent-elect's only hope.
