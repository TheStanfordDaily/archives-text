A HILL OF DIVORCEMENT (KKO)
—Al the Varsity Theatre.
From almost any standpoint this
is one of the finest pictures to be
shown here for some time. Starting
with a story itself excellent and un
manned by Hollywood conventions,
it is played by a cast which, al
though not advertised as such, is one
of the best thai has been assembled
in one picture.
Clemenee Dane's story deals with
the effect upon his family of the re
turn of a man long insane, who
comes back as from the dead. His
wife, Billie Burke, after procrasti
nating many years, has finally ob
tained a divorce and i.s planning re
marriage; his daughter, Kalherine
Hepburn, is also about to be mar
ried, but learning that the insanity
in the family is hereditary, realizes
that marriage is for her impossible.
All this might easily' lead to melo
drama or a heart-jerking sob story,
but it is handled with such dis
criminate nand restraint that it al
most becomes true tragedy. Three is
no attempt made to build to dra
matis heights or climaxes, but the
full terrior of th situation is realized.
Nor does the story end in the black
est despair, but rather on a slight
upward note.
The central role is that of the
daughter, Katherine Hepburn. Not
only is she the one who loses most
by the situation, but also upon her
is thrust the responsibility for the
final decisions. In this portrayal of a
young girl attempting to control a
situation which will certainly wreck
her life and possibly those of the
other characters, Mis.s Hepburn has
created a role of tragic proportions.
This entire review might be given
over to praises of her acting without

danger of becoming too effusive.
Billie Burke as the wife has a dif
ficult, somewhat colorless role; .she
is a passive character, always acted
upon rather than acting. To make j
this role convincing without yield
ing to the temptation of overplaying I
it was a difficult task, admirably ac
complished. John Barrymore got
away from the mannerisms that
have marred some of his recent pic
tures to give a fine portrayal of the
formerly insane husband. There
were several jerky spots in his char
acterization which may be explained j
by the cutting; the final transition :
in his attitude seemed a trifle j.
abrupt.
On the same bill may be seen "Air
Hostess." I cannot in fairness review
it, having seen only the first five and :
the last five minutes. However, by
going to the late show one can avoid
this, and also avoid a sartoon featur
ing Betty Boop and Irene Bordoni.
