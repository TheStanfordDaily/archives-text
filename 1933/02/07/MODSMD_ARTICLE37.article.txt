## 
### 
Almost every organization on the
Stanford campus will be represented
in the 1933 Quad, Manager Ed
Bunting declared yesterday. The
yearbook is celebrating with the
current issue its fortieth anniver
sary, and promises a large Organi
zations section than any of its pre
decessors.
Bunting also announced that
presidents of the few clubs which
have not yet made page reservations
may do so within a day or two, but
not later. Staff members at the Quad
office will arrange for group pic
tures on any day of the week, he
said.
