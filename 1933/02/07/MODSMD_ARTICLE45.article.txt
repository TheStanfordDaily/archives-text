# Campus Opinion
## A 						CAUTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the hope of suggesting a few
ideas that will be helpful in reduc
ing the traffic hazards for the pe
destrians 011 the campus I should
like to point out three mistakes that
are frequently made by students
who are walking about the campus
after dark. Many people cross La
suen in the vicinity of the Library,
Quad, and Union after dark with
the same feeling of security as they
do in broad daylight. They appar
ently are confident that the motor
ists can see them, and will avoid
them, and so they often step out
into the street, pause in the center
between two cars that are traveling
in opposite directions, and then con
tinue across. The fact of the matter
is that though the cars are readily
seen by the pedestrian, the drivers
of the cars that pass close by him
often do not see him at all until j
they are nearly past him. Usually at
that time it would be too late to
swerve and miss the pedestrian, if
he chanced to be too near the path
of one of the cars. Drivers at night
usually follow the tail-light of ihe i

car ahead of them, and do not ex
pect that anyone will .step into the
road a short distance ahead.
People who are waiting for a ride
to Palo Alto from the intersection at
the English corner are apt to stand
far out on the street. Anyone who
wishes to give them a lift is obliged
to stop in the middle of the street
and stand the risk of a collision from
behind, or he must go around them
and stop fifty or more feet beyond,
where there is an opportunity to
draw to the side of the road.
Some of Ihe commuters to Palo
Alto insist on walking along the side
of Palm Drive at night instead of on
the sidewalk. If they want a ride
they should stand under a light at
road side. If they want to walk, they
should use the sidewalk. Though
motorists on the campus are at
times to blame for traveling too fast
in areas that thye know they should
wafch more carefully, pedestrians
are also partly to blame for the risks
â€”and usually they are n<U aware
of their mistakes.
Sincerely,
