While enthusiasm's halo still glows on Saturday night's Charity dance,
we offer a bit of free advice to I ho Student Relief Committee.
More than a thousand spectators attended the all-University boxing
tournament last Thursday, and went home satisfied with the evening's
entertainment.
It may be a recurrence of primeval brutality, sadism, or almost
anything, Ixil the fact remains—Stanford students like their fights.
They'll pay money to see good bouts, whether fought for charily, fun.
or glory.
May we suggest a "card" which we believe would draw the greatest
crowd in Stanford boxing history:
Main Event: Phil Smith vs. Keith Topping
Semi-Windup: Jim Feely vs. Fred Glover
Special Event: Waldo Munday vs. Bob Quinn
Preliminaries: John Fowler vs. Eben Stromquist; Ira Jones vs. Oscar
Baer; Yuji Imai vs. John Huston; Louis Ruschin vs. Morris Oppenheim
PHIL JOHNSTON vs. MILO MALLOKY (California tackle and
former national heavyweight champion).
BEN PALAMOUNTAIN vs. HANK SCIIALDACH (overlooking a
forty-pound discrepancy).
Phil Smith vs. Krith Topping!
Polished boxer and punishing infighter vs. natural athlete ard slugger,
these two rank high in the Happy-Hunting-Ground of Stanford heavy
weight boxing mythology. Smith has the advantage in experience and
weight, Topping in youth and punch.
The intercollegiate bouts would probably rival in interest the Smith-
Topping and Fecly-Glover battles. Mallory and Schaldach are ac
complished fighters, but have not boxed recently.
There are numerous other bouts which could be arranged—the card
i could be completely remade. But the idea is the thing. At two-bits a
throw, we hazard a guess that ; program featuring a Smith-Topping fight
j would fill the Pavilion. . —A.J.G.
