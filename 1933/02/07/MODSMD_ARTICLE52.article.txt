Amos Alonzo Stagg, "Grand Old Man" of the gridiron, will sever
relations with the University of Chicago next year and come to College
of the Pacific but he will always hold a high regard for his U. of C. teams.
Here he is seen bidding his last Chicago eleven a cheery farewell alter
the final game of the season, in which Chicago was edged out by Wis
consin. S to 7.
