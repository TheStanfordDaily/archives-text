# Bad Shot Gives 25 Cent Payoff On Golf Course
## 
### 
Golf, the great Scotch game,
loosened up and gave Bill El
lington, assistant track coach
here, two-bits for making a
limn drive Saturday afternoon
on the Stanford course, Elling
ton revealed yesterday after
noon.
Playing with Robert Swain,
son of the acting president. El
lington sent has tee shot down
the first fairway for only a fair
distance of I!HJ yards, he said,
and then walked down to find
the money resting against the
pellet.
Ellington was at loss to ex
plain why the ball should pick
out that spot of all the acreage
on the links, but it netted 25
cents which promptly went in
Bill .Ir.'s hank. Nobody "plant
ed" the money there, both El
lington and Swain said, because
they were the only ones on the
fairway at the June.
