battle for the final honors: to have
their names engraved in bronze

Moore and Richard Ryan, will be
declared winners after the final
moot court session of the year, to
be held sometime next May.
Shibley and Vargas won from
Jean Blum and James Boccardo in
a case involving an injunction to
stop a coal dust nuisance. Marion R.
Kirkwood, dean of the law school,
judged the case.
One week later, Howard Moore
and Dick Ryan, using human inter
est tactics in the amateur courtroom,
defeated Ralph Lui and Daniel Bry
ant. The decision, involving a ques
tion of seepage of gas from a helium
plant, was rendered by George E.
Osborne, professor of law.
Freshman moot court trials were
held this quarter for the first time
in three years. There were six. trials

cient Shaw's courtroom to win a
decision from Homer Kidwell and
Jim Richmond in a legal tilt over a
fight between two Irishmen.
Perry Churchill, winner of last
year's moot court, judged the case
between Louis Bulsasky and Bob
Gahagan and a winning outfit to
Louis Penfield and George Bellows.
The question was one in contracts.
