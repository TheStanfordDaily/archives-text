# Stanford Savants Voice Opinions Of Depression
## 
### 
From a crash of "paper values" on
Wall Street to a "temporary slump"
to a world-wide depression of un
precedented severity, an economic
cyclone rips its way across the so
cial fabric.
From a theory of "letting it work
itself out" to a sober realization of
the urgency of the need, American
thought finally turns to the solv
ing of its industrial knot, one of the
ramifications of which—agrarian
unrest —is shown in the photo
above.
Inflation, technocracy, socialized
control, "Buy American," govern
ment works, "Balance the Budget,"
Communism have each won their
adherents.
Howard Scott, ousted head of the
technicians, is shown in an adjoin
ing column after his return to
Columbia.
The Daily here offers the opinions
of outstanding faculty members on
the question of the hour: "Whither
Capitalism?"
George B. Culver: It would be
presumptious to say "when the de
pression will end," but I think that
individual optimism and cheerful
ness should help.
Marion R. Kirk wood: Our eco
nomic machine has become highly
complicated, and once out of gear, it
is exceedingly difficult to re-syn
chronize the parts. We must either
get the old machine going again, or
replace it with a new one. Person
ally, I prefer the former alternative
and I fully expect to see it come
about.
John B. Canning: I see no evi
dence of a substantial recovery be
gun. There is no evidence in an in
dustrial way that the depression has
started recovery or even reached its
worst.
J. P. Treat: I don't know a thing
about the depression. If you'd ask
me my choice between Chinese nuts
or cocoanuts or Chinese New Year,
I could tell you, but not about the
depression.
Richard T. LaPiere: The capital
istic system gets mixed up every so
often, and nobody knows when or
how we-will straighten out this
time. The depression is the result of
the system, a total complex of social
relationships. The war debts are just
a small part of the whole problem.
Elmer I). Fagan: It is reasonable to
believe that under the incoming
administration there will be enacted
some constructive legislation. How
ever, I do not believe that the
Democrats will do anything to effect
immediate improvement, nor do I
see any other factors now in prog
ress which should briflg any imme
diate impiovement.
Russell 11. Bangh: There is no
particular reason to be optimistic
as to immediate recovery although
the depression has lasted some time.
We can't judge upturn of one de
pression by those of the past. Some
think signs of recovery in one busi
ness are a forerunner of recovery,
but this cannot be taken as a defi
nite indication.
