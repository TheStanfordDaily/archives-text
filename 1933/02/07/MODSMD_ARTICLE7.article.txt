# Stanford Savants Voice Opinions Of Depression
## 
### 
From a crash of "paper values" on
Wall Street to a "temporary slump"
to a world-wide depression of un
precedented severity, an economic
cyclone rips its way across the so
cial fabric.
From a theory of "letting it work
itself out" to a sober realization of
the urgency of the need, American
thought finally turns to the solv
ing of its industrial knot, one of the
ramifications of which—agrarian
unrest —is shown in the photo

Howard Scott, ousted head of the
technicians, is shown in an adjoin

The Daily here offers the opinions
of outstanding faculty members on
the question of the hour: "Whither
Capitalism?"
George B. Culver: It would be
presumptious to say "when the de
pression will end," but I think that
individual optimism and cheerful
ness should help.
Marion R. Kirk wood: Our eco
nomic machine has become highly
complicated, and once out of gear, it
is exceedingly difficult to re-syn
chronize the parts. We must either
get the old machine going again, or
replace it with a new one. Person
ally, I prefer the former alternative
and I fully expect to see it come
about.
John B. Canning: I see no evi
dence of a substantial recovery be
gun. There is no evidence in an in
dustrial way that the depression has
started recovery or even reached its
worst.
J. P. Treat: I don't know a thing
about the depression. If you'd ask
me my choice between Chinese nuts
or cocoanuts or Chinese New Year,
I could tell you, but not about the
depression.
Richard T. LaPiere: The capital
istic system gets mixed up every so
often, and nobody knows when or
how we-will straighten out this
