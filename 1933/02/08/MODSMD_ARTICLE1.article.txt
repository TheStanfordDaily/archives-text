# CARDINAL CAGE QUINTET FOULS IN SCRIMMAGE
## Use S.C. Tactics Preparing For Trojan Tilts Over Week-End WORK ON FAST BREAK Lineup For Friday Contest Includes Usual Five 
### Dick Strouse 
In a raw, rough, rambunctious
scrimmage featured by a fouling de
fense that was mimicing U.S.C.,
Stanford's basketball varsity mauled
through five battered substitutes to
the dissatisfaction of Coach John
Bunn and the pugilistic satisfaction
of the regulars.
Led by Jay Tod, who considerably
exaggerates the "hard" in the phrase
"hard-playing guard," the first five
dribbled through when they couldn't
get around a second team that used
everything except the Pavilion doors
to stop them. Imitating the Trojans
in zeal as well as man-to-man de
fense, A1 Page, Chuck Coiner, Pal
mer Fuller, Frank Eastman, and
"Stoop" Stilleson gave their more
famous opponents a real workout.
Plan OfTense
Since S.C. plays a man-to-man
defense, Bunn has ordered his play
ers to break fast and to dribble
around the Trojan who is guarding
them. The idea is that a Stanford
player is as good as a Trojan any
day, and that therefore Cordry,
Topping, etc., can get a step ahead
of their respective guards.
Once ahead, the Stanfords are
supposed to be free to toss the ball
through the basket, a fundamental
part of basketball. Of course, the
Trojans would rather foul an Indian
player than allow him a set-up,
which is why the scrubs were or
dered to play hard and fast yester
day.
Same Card Lineup
The regular lineup includes, as
usual, Captain Tom Cordry at one
forward, Jay Tod and John Hancock
at the guards, and Keith Topping
and Hal Edelen alternating at the
other forward and center. Topping,
an expert dribbler and a dead un
der-the-basket shot, stood out in
the scrimmage.
The best play of the day, however,
was made by Hancock. John was in
the longitudinal or latitudinal or
horizontal middle of the court and
running toward the sideline when
he caught a pass, and without stop
ping, swished the ball through the
basket. Which IS a fundamental
part of basketball.

For those who plan to attend the
basket balling prize fights Friday
and Saturday nights, the program
(caused by this man-to-man idea)
will be something like this. Little
Anderson; Jay Tod will tangle with
Tom Cordry will face Goliath Sonny
Lee "the Great" Guttero; "I am
Jerry" Nemer will be up against
gigantic John Hancock; Bill Bescos
of the invisible fouls will try to out
push Hal Edelen, who also fouls,
but not so invisibly; and boxer Keith
Topping will pick on Sax Elliot.

of the regulars.
Led by Jay Tod, who considerably
exaggerates the "hard" in the phrase
"hard-playing guard," the first five
dribbled through when they couldn't
get around a second team that used
everything except the Pavilion doors
to stop them. Imitating the Trojans
in zeal as well as man-to-man de
fense, A1 Page, Chuck Coiner, Pal
mer Fuller, Frank Eastman, and
"Stoop" Stilleson gave their more
famous opponents a real workout.
Plan OfTense
Since S.C. plays a man-to-man
defense, Bunn has ordered his play
ers to break fast and to dribble
around the Trojan who is guarding
them. The idea is that a Stanford
player is as good as a Trojan any
day, and that therefore Cordry,
Topping, etc., can get a step ahead
of their respective guards.
Once ahead, the Stanfords are
supposed to be free to toss the ball
through the basket, a fundamental
part of basketball. Of course, the
Trojans would rather foul an Indian
player than allow him a set-up,
which is why the scrubs were or
dered to play hard and fast yester
day.
Same Card Lineup
The regular lineup includes, as
usual, Captain Tom Cordry at one
forward, Jay Tod and John Hancock
at the guards, and Keith Topping
and Hal Edelen alternating at the
other forward and center. Topping,
an expert dribbler and a dead un
der-the-basket shot, stood out in
the scrimmage.
The best play of the day, however,
was made by Hancock. John was in
the longitudinal or latitudinal or
horizontal middle of the court and
running toward the sideline when
he caught a pass, and without stop
ping, swished the ball through the
basket. Which IS a fundamental
part of basketball.

For those who plan to attend the
basket balling prize fights Friday
and Saturday nights, the program
(caused by this man-to-man idea)
will be something like this. Little
Anderson; Jay Tod will tangle with
Tom Cordry will face Goliath Sonny
Lee "the Great" Guttero; "I am
Jerry" Nemer will be up against
gigantic John Hancock; Bill Bescos
of the invisible fouls will try to out
push Hal Edelen, who also fouls,
but not so invisibly; and boxer Keith
Topping will pick on Sax Elliot.
In a raw, rough, rambunctious
scrimmage featured by a fouling de
fense that was mimicing U.S.C.,
Stanford's basketball varsity mauled
through five battered substitutes to
the dissatisfaction of Coach John
Bunn and the pugilistic satisfaction
of the regulars.
