# GAELS, CARDS DISCUSS WAR DEBT ISSUES
## Feely, Munday, And Zulch Represent Stanford In No Decision Debate 
### 
Jim Feely, Waldo Munday, and
Paul Zulch, representing Stanford
University, last night debated with
St. Mary's the question: "Resolved,
That the United States should agree
to the cancellatiton of the inter
allied war debts."
Speaking on the negative of the
question, the Farm's Feely stated:
"It is fruitless to cancel. World
trade would not be benefitted by
the proposed measures."
Munday Demands Pay
In oratorical fashion, Waldo Mun
day held that it was unfair to the
American taxpayer to cancel the
war debts. He said: "The war dogs
of Europe are now attempting to
bite the hand that fed them.''
Zulch wound up the negative case
with the argument that Europe was
well able to pay the debts since she
has been expending 70 per cent
more for armaments in the post
war period than she spent before
the great combat*.
St. Mary's Affirmative
St. Mary's, affirmative, pleaded the
inability of Europe to pay, the mor
al responsibility of America to help
pay for the World War, and the
fact that cancellation of the debts
could be used as a lever to secure
favorable trade concession for the
United States.
In the second half of the dual de
bate with St. Mary's, Richard Clare,
Ray Hanson, and Dick Van Wage
nen will meet the Moraga Valley
ites tomorrow night at a special
meeting of the International Rela
tions Club.
