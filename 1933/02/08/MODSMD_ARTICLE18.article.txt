# '500' Challenges Roughs To Make Hi-Jinks Success
## 
### 
Stanford's much - discussed
and oft-disgusted "500" is now
anticipating a new thrill. It is
patiently awaiting the efforts of
its masculine fellow-Farmites
to present their spring girl-less
burlesque.
Most of the fair ones think it
is a huge ioke; and are, figur
atively, at least, holding their
breaths to see just what the
campus Romcos and S.A. boys
are capable of doing.
More cynically inclined cam
pus lights add to the "capable
of doing" clause a sneering "if
anything." The sclf-sufTicicnt
attitude of the males not only
amuses them, but irks them in
addition.
In short, Stanford men, it's a
challenge!
