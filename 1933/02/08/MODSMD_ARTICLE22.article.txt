SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7 (/P)â€”Gov
ernor Rolph was gagged yesterday
by the Senate investigating commit
tee probing into affairs of his ad
ministration, at least for the present.
Under the rule, the newspapers
of the state were also gagged, ac
cording to the San Francisco Chron
icle. On Ihe motion of Senator H. C.
Jones of San Jose no consideration
of any communication is permitted
unless the committee has approved
its reading or filing.
Committee Rows
Recent attempts of the Governor
and his counsel, Isadore Golden of
San Francisco, to break into the
procedure of the inquisitors with
charges against Senator Jack Inmau
and Sheridan Downey, provoked
passing of the gag rule.
Yesterday's meeting was enlivened
when Earl Kelley, State Director of
Public Works, called Walter Gar
rison, deposed works director, "a
liar," and Garrison promptly re
plied in kind.
Prison Graft Charged
The Governor charged Inman wiili
"selling his political influence" and
with receiving money for obtaining
pardons for San Quentin prisoners.
Inman is chairman of the investi
gating committee. Downey its coun
sel. was charged with making sug
gestions in the case of Albert Marco,
reputed former Los Angeles vice
overlord now seeking release from
the penitentiary.
Rolph's accusations stated three
items assertedly accepted by Inman,
a total of over 53,000. Any further
communications from the Governor
will be strictly withheld from the
press unless the committee passes
on them. Any further charges will
not be allowed, moreover, to inter
rupt the schedule of hearings, but
will await its termination for con
sideration or referring to the
Senate.
The investigating committee, with
neither Senator Inman nor Counsel
Downey participating in the discus
sion, decided today to let the Rolpn
charges wait until the present hear
ings have been concluded. The
charges may even be shunted over
to the Senate when the Legislature
reconvenes on February 28.
