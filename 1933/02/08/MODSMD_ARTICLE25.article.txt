# CHECKING THE SNAIL'S PACE
## 
### 
I lie Palo Alio board of safely lias ordered 11 le city po
lice department lo clamp down oil speeders within llie
limils of well, who knows just where the Palo Alto citv
limits begin or end? The announcement of that fact car
ried with il a humorous touch; imparted by the Palo Alio
Tunes, which carried the following headline yesterday aft
ernoon: "Police Force Instructed to Make Arrests."
In the first place, and contrary to whatever the board
of safety or anybody else may say, the Palo Alto police
have never been at all reticent about the matter of making
arrests. They are jusl about as unblushing a bunch of
rum, speed, and noise chasers as the most sober-minded
community could desire.
"We can't expect absolute, literal enforcement of the
legal speed limits, so the motorists will be given a small Ice
way, stated the safety board's chairman. Therein is the
cheering note of the board's ultimatum. Now if the police
would just relax a little after midnight, say, their "lee
way" would be more accurately within the margin of logic.
But while the safety board was concerning itself with
ni.p.h. at and between intersections, il overlooked a much
more distressing situation. II is doubtful if the board
members ever counted the wrinkled fenders on Univer
sity Avenue. On that street someone is always bumping
fenders with somebody else's Aunt Hetlie, in her I!M7
phaeton, and surely not even the safety board will deny
that trallic moves as slowly on University Avenue as on
anv other downtown thoroughfare in the western hemi
sphere.
Seriously, something should be done or said, by the
safely board or the police themselves, which would en
courage motorists lo step a little harder on the gas in Palo
Alto's business district. The snail's pace has certainly put
no halt to accidents in that area, while, as a matter of in
convenience, it's well-nigh perfect.
