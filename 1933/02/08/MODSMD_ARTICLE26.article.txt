# CHANGE THE NAME

### 
There is little that can justly bo said in opposition to j
the clamor aroused by citizens of the southern part of this '
slate to sever 1.(1.1..A. from its mother university, U.C. at I
I lerkelcy.
Not altogether indifferent to the problems of Califor- !
ilia's state university, or universities, the average tuition- |
payer of this vieinity would undoubtedly view such a move !
with mild approbation. After all, 1.(1. and I'.C.L.A. are'
in fact already two separate institutions, each with its own
local problems, ils own philosophies, its own social heri
tage. Then, 100, the administrative tie between the two
schools is said to he responsible for the fact that they have
never met on the gridiron, a situation which luis robbed
the coast of ;i lot of good football contests.
Hut one caution, if separation is decided upon. Let
the name of the southern institution be changed, so that
touring lowans can no longer be shown, by lowans who
have taken permanent residence in Los Angeles, the!
I'.C.L.A. campus with a flourish of civic pride and a
"There, brethren, is the Cniversity of California about
which vou have heard so much."
