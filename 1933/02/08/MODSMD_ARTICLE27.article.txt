Alter hiking two resounding heatings from the Tro
jans, the Daily Californian rose in all its majesty and
eluded the southerners for roughness. Apparently warmed
by its own words, the editorial proceeded to call the very
effective quintet of t .S.C.. ;i miniature model of a football
team.
Admitting thiil the Hears could he classed as bruisers,
the (.alifornian seemed to feel that there was some in-|
justice in having to meet the well recognized brawn of
the I rojans again on the basketball court with the not so!
well recognized brawn of the Golden Hears.
Those who have seen the present basketball season ad
mit that there is little to choose between the tactics of the
tour conference universities. To accuse anyone of a spe
cialized type of rough play, especially when that play has |
caused the downfall of your (earn, is unduly stretching I
out the proboscis.
r.ven more annoying to the C.alifornian editors must be
the actual fads of the game which show that the Hears
were credited with more fouls than the Trojans. Not only
do the southerners play harder but they are more inlelli-!
gent in their tactics! This certainly must be gall and worm- ]
wood to the gentlemen at Berkeley.
The moral, if there must be one, seems lo lie in the
condition that allows admittedly rough and illegal tactics
lo prevail. Basketball is a good enough game in itself not !
lo have lo depend on any foreign attractions, such as fool
ball methods, to have an appeal.
