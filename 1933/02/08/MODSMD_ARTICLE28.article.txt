# BULL SESSION
## TERPSICHOREAN TUSSLE 
### 
The campus was surprised to see
the Ex Committee put on the De
pression Dunce last Friday. Both
the Campus and the Ex Committee
were surprised at its big success.
Let them put their head to the
wheel and keep the ball rolling. How
about another dance this Saturday
night after the basketball game with
S;im Barry?
The same reasons hold this Sat
urday as last—except more so. The
moon is larger this week. The sky
is clearer. The urge to dance is
greater. The post-game gnp remains
just as large as ever; it's always
too big. The Ex Committee should
fill that gap. On with the dance . . .
There is only one trouble with
depression dances —and the idea
isn't personal in the least. It was
discovered last year. It is too easy
for men to come alone. It's so easy
that after about two depression
dances, they don't bring women at
all. Then, it really is bad. The
dances suffer a metamorphism. They
degenerate into combination bull
sessions and smokers. These activi
ties can be conducted in the com
fort of one's room at less expense
and more comfort than at the wo
men's gym. And so the depression
dance ceases to be—peters out to a
sad end.
In other words, if this form of en
tertainment is to be maintained,
something must be done to keep a
sufficient number of women on the
dance floor. For obviously a dance
without women is like a car without
wheels—it never gets any place.
Several methods have been sug

gested to get the women.
The proposal to have University
vehicles transport the women
wholesale is a bit too reminiscent of
the late lamented B.A.C. sheep
drives.- The plea to have women
come alone seems to have shattered
on the unscalable wall of feminine
pride. If the women are to come,
the men must bring them. The gods
have so decreed. Our destiny is
sealed.
Man, being naturally an inert
mass, will not call a woman and
make a date unless forced to by
unavoidable circumstances. How to
create those unavoidable circum
stances is quite a problem. Terror
ism, under some sort ol' mystic klan
system, might, be effective but too
'un-American. Appeals to manly
vanity are as naught when com
pared with manly inertia.
Money according to Marx and sex
according to Freud are the first
principles of life. Maybe they are
both right. Let's consolidate. Charge
a lone rough the same price as a
couple—fifty cents. This should de
crease th<# number of wolves. At
least eventually some price for
roughs can be evolved where the
discomfort of making a date will be
balanced by the discomfort at pay
ing for admission to the dance.
Then, the permanent success of
depression dances will be assured.
Fifty cents a couple—fifty cents a
rough—student body cards—this
Saturday night—Women's Gym—Ex

discomfort of making a date will be
balanced by the discomfort at pay

Fifty cents a couple—fifty cents a
rough—student body cards—this
Saturday night—Women's Gym—Ex
Committee, we ask you.

The campus was surprised to see
the Ex Committee put on the De
pression Dunce last Friday. Both
the Campus and the Ex Committee
were surprised at its big success.
Let them put their head to the
wheel and keep the ball rolling. How
about another dance this Saturday
night after the basketball game with
S;im Barry?
The same reasons hold this Sat
urday as last—except more so. The
moon is larger this week. The sky
is clearer. The urge to dance is
greater. The post-game gnp remains
just as large as ever; it's always
too big. The Ex Committee should
fill that gap. On with the dance . . .
There is only one trouble with
depression dances —and the idea
isn't personal in the least. It was
discovered last year. It is too easy
for men to come alone. It's so easy
that after about two depression
dances, they don't bring women at
all. Then, it really is bad. The
dances suffer a metamorphism. They
degenerate into combination bull
sessions and smokers. These activi
ties can be conducted in the com
fort of one's room at less expense
and more comfort than at the wo
men's gym. And so the depression
dance ceases to be—peters out to a
sad end.
In other words, if this form of en
tertainment is to be maintained,
something must be done to keep a
sufficient number of women on the
dance floor. For obviously a dance
without women is like a car without
wheels—it never gets any place.
Several methods have been sug

gested to get the women.
