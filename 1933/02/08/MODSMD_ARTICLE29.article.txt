j The fact that plays, especially

j ful performance; the difficulty with
; Wilde's plays at present is that they
i are just beginning to reach the point
I where audiences judge them, not by
I present standards, but as they
; would judge an older piny. As soon
1 as audiences take this attitude the
; obvious epigrams, conscious wit of
| the characters, and transparent plot
! are accepted as conventions of the
! period, and do not detract from the
J play. Indeed, the appeal of this
: comedy is sufficient to transcend the
| barrier of time, and probably will
continue popular.
The present performance may
i have been rough in detail, but more
j than made up for this by Ihe spirit
j and ability with which it was acted,
i All overacted to various degrees,
and by this got over the dull spots
j but failed to secure the necessary
smoothness. The tempo also might
j have been picked up a bit.
Outstanding was Peg Converse as
I Cecily. She overplayed to just the
I right degree, and with the aid of
j clever, but not obvious pantomime

realized the fullest possibilities of
her rather thin part. Sidney Head
as Algernon played smoothly but
with more restraint than the others,
with the result that his role, espe
cially in the scenes with Jack,
seemed colorless. Frank Erlin as
Jack was excellent in the first act,
but unfortunately merely repeated
his same gestures for the rest of the ;
play. His continual yse of panto
mime and facial expression also at
first seemed excellent, but grew
monotonous. Cathereine Musante
overdid Gwendoline too much; her 1
characterization was exactly the i
same as in her campus roles in "In-,
spector General" and "Mistress of
Briony." The minor characters of
Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism, and
Rev. Chasuble were overplayed as
much as possible, which is the way
they should be played: still, the ten
dency of these actors to laugh too
much at their roles was a disad
vantage.
Burton Cairns is to be especially
commended for his settings; they
showed, for the first time in many
Community Theatre productions, the
application of some real thought and
preparation. The furniture was ex
cellent. The lighting was less well
handled. —Sandoe

EARNEST—At the Palo Alto
Community Theatre.
j The fact that plays, especially
! comedies soon become dated is
! really no deterrent to their success
j ful performance; the difficulty with
; Wilde's plays at present is that they
i are just beginning to reach the point
I where audiences judge them, not by
I present standards, but as they
; would judge an older piny. As soon
1 as audiences take this attitude the
; obvious epigrams, conscious wit of
| the characters, and transparent plot
! are accepted as conventions of the
! period, and do not detract from the
J play. Indeed, the appeal of this
: comedy is sufficient to transcend the
| barrier of time, and probably will
continue popular.
The present performance may
i have been rough in detail, but more
j than made up for this by Ihe spirit
j and ability with which it was acted,
i All overacted to various degrees,
and by this got over the dull spots
j but failed to secure the necessary
smoothness. The tempo also might
j have been picked up a bit.
Outstanding was Peg Converse as
I Cecily. She overplayed to just the
I right degree, and with the aid of
j clever, but not obvious pantomime

realized the fullest possibilities of
her rather thin part. Sidney Head
as Algernon played smoothly but
with more restraint than the others,
with the result that his role, espe
cially in the scenes with Jack,
seemed colorless. Frank Erlin as
Jack was excellent in the first act,
but unfortunately merely repeated
his same gestures for the rest of the ;
play. His continual yse of panto
mime and facial expression also at
first seemed excellent, but grew
monotonous. Cathereine Musante
overdid Gwendoline too much; her 1
characterization was exactly the i
same as in her campus roles in "In-,
spector General" and "Mistress of
Briony." The minor characters of
Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism, and
Rev. Chasuble were overplayed as
much as possible, which is the way
they should be played: still, the ten
dency of these actors to laugh too
much at their roles was a disad
vantage.
Burton Cairns is to be especially
commended for his settings; they
showed, for the first time in many
Community Theatre productions, the
application of some real thought and
preparation. The furniture was ex
cellent. The lighting was less well
handled. —Sandoe
