# HITLER SWINGS INTO GERMAN POWER
## 
### 

Adolf Hitler (center), picturesque leader of the German fascists, is the new chancellor of Germany. In
granting the fiery Nazi chief the long-sought place at the head of the government, President Von liindenburg
surrounded him with a compromise cabinet of conservatives like Konstantin von Neurath (left), who remains
foreign minister; Franz von Papen (second from left), former chancellor and confidant of the president, and
Alfred Hugcnberg (right), the nationalist chief. HermanGoering (second from right), one of Hitler's chief lieu
tenants, was made a minister without portfolio. Picture above shows some of Hitler's famous Nazi storm troops.
