SOUNDS OKEH
The Editor, Sir:
I should like to know if it would
be possible, in order to help out the
Student Relief Fund, to charge stu
dents ten cents admission for bas
ketball games. Of course our stu
dent body cards entitle us to free
admission, but certainly we could
all afford ten cents for student re
lief. It's very little to jisk of stu
dents, and it ought to bring in at
the least one hundred dollars a
game. If the idea could be used in
regard to basketball, perhaps it
could be used with baseball games
and later, track meets.
Sincerely, Sue Ward, '35
P.S.: If of practical importance,
could this suggestion be referred to
the Committee on Student Relief?
