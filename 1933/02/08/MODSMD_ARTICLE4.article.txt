| Interpreting a delightful program
j with simplicity and understanding,
i the Marbrooke Ensemble presented
!an appreciative audience with an
| hour of enjoyable music in the As
i sembly Hall last night.
1 The program began with Rossini's
| "La Promessa" given by the v/hole
' ensemble. Winifred Eslabrook El
| liott's soprano voice blended with
J the violin stranis of Elisabeth
j Pierce and the notes of Mary Elisa-
I beth Moynihan at the piano in this
j selection which had the delicacy of
j the play of fountain waters.
Violin Solos
Miss Peirce then presented a
' group of three violin solos begin
ning with a tranquil Aria by Bach.
Next came a charming, gay sketch,
! "Old Vienna," by Godowsky-Press,
j followed by the haunting strains of
I Kreisler's popular "La Gitana."
Mrs. Elliott, concert soprano, then
| appeared in "Marietta's Song" from
! Korngold's "Dead City." This plain
! live German song was followed by a
lilting, gay selection, "Mandoline,'
j by Dupont. "Retreat" by La Forge
i was a dramatic lament against the
! cares of life. In "The Bird of the
I Wilderness" by Horsman, Mrs. El
j liott's voice rose in abandon to give
I her finest performance.
Moynihan Good
Miss Moynihan then gave a group
of three piano selections beginning
with "Nell" by Faure-Grainger. The
| climax of the evening came in her
i masterful playing of Gluck-Fried
j man's minor melody, "Ballet des
| Ombres Heureuses." Her handling
jof this selection's difficult thrills
| showed a faultless technique.
The program ended with a group
I given by the whole ensemble. First
j came Rachmaninoff's sad appeal, "O
i Cease Thy Singing." Most appropri
; ate was Weil's "Spring Song," ex~
I pressive of the restless feeling which
comes about this time of year.
