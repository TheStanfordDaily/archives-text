# Varsity Baseball Nine Faces Kenealy Seals Again Today
## S.F. AGGREGATION MAY FIND TOUGH FOE IN CARD NINE Ex-Major and Minor League Stars Will Play For Kenealy Seals 
### 
Having watched his varsity base
ball team drop two straight practice
games through inability to make
runs over into hits, Coach Harry
Wolter will send hi;; charges against
the Kenealy Seals for the second
time I his season at .":15 o'clock on
the Sunken Diamond, hoping that
three hard practice sessions have
polished up the Indian nine.
On the mound Wolter will start
Harry Stark, who looked so well
against the Seals a week ago, follow
with Bob Savinske, and end up with
either Howo or Heringer, or both.
Behind the plate will be Jim Mas
sey, who has done most of the re
ceiving so far. Captain Livermore
will probably get a chance to exer
cise his ailing Hipper in the closing
innings.
The first base assignment goes
to Mallatratt'and Art Hearn, who
seem to have outdistanced the rest
of the initial sack contenders, while
down around second base the fans
will get another look at Jim Wool
ley, who performed so well in his
varsity debut last Saturday.
Third base and shortstop will bo
occupied by the veterans, Jerry
Trautman and Bert Delmas.
In the outer gardens, Wolter is
trying ;:ii almost new combination
with Jimmy Irsl'eld in left, Fred
,'Maggiora in center field, and Dick
Miles in right. Miles is the only
letterman among the outfielders, and
Irsfeld has looked good enough in
the practice games to rate a starting
assignment. Wolter has not been
satisfied with the hitting shown so
far, and along with the fact that he
has only th games today and Sat
urday to get. a line on his material,
this probably accounts for the
switches in his opening lineup.
The Seals are bringing the same
lineup that faced the Indians a week
ago, and present an opening nine
that includes such famous names as
Cronin, Fonseca, Johnson, the Mon
tagues, Ward, and Garibaldi. Bud
Olsen, who recently signed with the
Mission Club of the Pacific Coast
League, will probably be on the
mound, with Frank Cox, of Seattle,
doing the receiving.
