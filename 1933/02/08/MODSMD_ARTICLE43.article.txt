# Bear Tankmen Here Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team meets California's tank team
Saturday afternoon at Encina pools
in the first of a two-game series in
the Northern California Water Polo
League.
Although the Indians have never
lost a water polo game to California,
Mid despite the fact that this year's
team is considered one of the best
in Stanford history, Saturday's game
will still be the Big Game of aquatic
competition as far as Farm fans are
concerned.
However, the odds aren't nearly
a.s large as they sound. The Bears 1
have a new pool and a new coach
this year. They have been slow get
ting started, but. have shown plenty
ot potential power in previous |
games. In fact, they led both the
Olympic Club and the Alliens Club
at half-time, weakening in the sec
ond period to lose hard-fought con
tests.
Stanford will also be facing the
psychological fact that it has never
lost a game in the new pools, built
in 1929, and has never lost to Cali
fornia.
The game Vs ill start at 3:30 o'clock.
Admission will be 25 cents with
student body cards and 10 cents for
tlii- general public.
