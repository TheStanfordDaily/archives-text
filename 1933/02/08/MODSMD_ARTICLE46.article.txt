# INDIAN FROSH SCHEDULE TWO EASY CONTESTS
## Yearlings Play Menlo J.C., Fresno In "Breather‚Äù Week-End Tilts 
### 
Jimmy Bradshaw's freshman bas
ketball players can "breathe" this
week-end. All they have on tap is
two basketball games with Menlo
Junior College and Fresno High.
After Saturday night's exhausting
encounter against Bill Higgins' Cali
fornia freshmen the Stanford year
lings may expect to run roughshod
over mere junior college and high
school competition. That's where
they're wrong . . .
Menlo, lacking the offensive
strength of former years, neverthe
less has a strong, well-balanced
team, resembling in this respect the
Stanford freshmen. Though Captain
Addie Barnett is a really fine guard,
and George Viguie, Ralph Mannion,
Dave Farber, and Don Greenlee are
very promising players, none of , the
1933 Stanford freshmen are yet of
varsity calibre.
Until the Bear contest last Sat
urday, the Papooses had gotten
along on a lot of good luck, and a
moderate amount of basketball.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw refuses to
qualify his praise of Viguie's amaz
ing coolness in helping Ralph Man
nion to execute the final winning
basket.
Hank Coiner, a very scrappy little
forward, and Ted Lindsay, high
scoring guard, will probably prove
Menlo's greatest threat in the ab
sence of accomplished Arne Ander
son, who will watch the game from
the bench, fie is nursing injuries.
Jack Clumeceke is the Menlo cen
ter. He is deadly on set-up shots
following fast dribbles from center
court.
