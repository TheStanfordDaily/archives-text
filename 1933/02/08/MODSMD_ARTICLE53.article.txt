## 
### 

An idea of Ihe size of the bridge now under construction that will
connect San Francisco with the mainland can he obtained from the
architect's design of one of the piers (left) that will support the
longest suspension span (12(H)) in the world, while at the right is a

view of one of the 740-foot-liigh towers. The bridge as it will look
is shown in the center. The view is from Land's End, on a municipal
golf course on the San Francisco side.
