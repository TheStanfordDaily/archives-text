The Bajaus, strange water gypsies
of the Sulu Sea, are among the
curious people studied by Dr. Albert
W. Herre, Stanford ichthyologist and
curator of the Museum.
These nomads of the sea were ob
served by Dr. Herre during the
course of 65,000 miles of travel in
the island groups of the Far East.
Dr. Herre says, "The Bajaus
never live on land but are born,
live, and die on the sea, making
their homes in rude houseboats.
They live exclusively by fishing.
They are found only along the
coasts of Borneo, Celebes, and the
Sibutu Islands, and occasionally as
far north as the Tawi Tawi group.
"The Bajaus are a comparatively
tall, lean Indonesian pagan people.

Both men and women wear their
hair long. They apparently h c we no
domestic arts. Their food is almost
oxclusively fish and cassava.
"The Bajaus are a feeble people,
in former days defenseless against
their piratical neighbors. They have
been able to survive as a definite
tribe because of their extreme pov
erty, which offered nothing to the
Samal pirates. They moor their
houseboats in groups which might
be termed villages, hidden in some
sheltered nook.
"The only land with which the
Bajaus have any permanent rela
tion is a tiny island which the
Sibutu people long ago named after
them. From time immemorial it has
been their burial ground."
