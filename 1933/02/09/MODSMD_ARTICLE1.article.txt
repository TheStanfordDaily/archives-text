# 97 Citations Issued By Palo Alto Police For Traffic Breaks
## Stanford Offenders in Minority as Palo Alto Board of Safety Opens Drive; Many Speeders Tagged; Charge of Pedestrian Bait Denied 
### 
Palo Alto police planned to continue their drive on arrests for traffic
violations following the issuance of !)7' citations yesterday in a big opening
sweep instituted by the Palo Alto Board of Safety.
Although Night Desk Officer Atwood was unable to determine the exact
number of charges in each class filed by arresting officers, his estimate
last evening placed three-fourths of the violations against speeders and
the balance against breaking laws of parking, failure to stop at arterial
signs and failure to observe pedes- '*>

trians* right of way.
Most Arrests in Morning
Most of the arrests were made in
the forenoon yesterday, with early
morning commuters suffering heav
ily. Up to 2 p.m., 84 tickets had been
issued, 63 of which were against
speeders, 17 agaainst motorists fail
ing to observe pedestrians' right of
way, and four against alleged fail
ures to stop at arterial signs.
Officer Atwood said that no more
arrests were recorded after that
time for failing to give pedestrians
their right of way. Reports that a
policewoman had been "baiting"
autoists by crossing University ave
nue as they drove up to an inter
section were denied by Chief How
ard Zink.
Court Hearings Thursday
Stanford students were in a dis
tinct minority, according to Officer
Atwood. Most of the violators were
Palo Alto residents, he said, al
though several lived in other cities
along the peninsula.
The offenders will be haled into
court Thursday afternoon.
