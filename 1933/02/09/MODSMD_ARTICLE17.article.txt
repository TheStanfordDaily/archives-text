# Bolivian Rough Accuses Paraguay Of Expansion
## 
### Elizabeth Paine 
The conflict between Bolivia and
Paraguay which sounds like the
usual South American upsetâ€”noisy
but safe, acquired the dimensions of
a bitter war through an interview
with an interested onlooker, Gaston
Rojas.
"The war climaxes a long feud
between the two countries," said
Rojas, a native of La Paz, Bolivia.
"Although my country has only
3,000,000 inhabitants, this is a big
war to us. Most of the men are in
service now, leaving the women to
run the business at home."
Since the Spanish colonies gained
independence, the southeast corner
of Bolivia has been disputed terri
tory. This land is all jungle bul

'very rich in oil, and Paraguay is
attempting to colonize it through a
company which imports Russian,
Hungarian, and Menonite settlers.
"At two other times Paraguay has
snatched parts of our land," the
Bolivian declared. "Now they want
new territory larger than the whole
country of Paraguay."
Rojas would like to join his
friends and his brother in fighting
for his country. Before coming to
this country lie served his student's
military duty of six months and
when war broke out last June he
offered his services. The Bolivian
government answered that it would
be more to his country's interest for
him to complete his engineering
course at Stanford.
