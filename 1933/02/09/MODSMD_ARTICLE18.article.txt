# UNFORTUNATE PUBLICITY
## 
### 
(Editorial)

One column lo the left, on lliis page, is a communication
to the Daily from Theodore J. Hoover, Dean of the en
i gineering school and brother of the President of the I nited
States. It is not about engineering, however, the field in
j which Dean Hoover is unquestionably an outstanding
authority.
It is about speed, about killers operating vehicles in
this community, about the inadequacy of our present legal
machinery to deal with those killers, -about the inability
j of undergraduates to drive sanely, and about facetious edi
torials and failure of the press to give more publicity to
; the tragic accident on Palm Drive last week, the accident
i which resulted in the death of a prominent professor.
*
It is untortunate that Dean Hoover chose this moment
to air publicly his displeasure with the manner in which
the police handled the case. So soon after the death, pub
licity will undoubtedly bring additional grief to the girl
! who has been completely exonerated of fault, and to the
wife and mother of the victim. The press realized this
i when it purposely avoided giving undue prominence to the
unhappy affair.
Rut the Daily, duty bound to print any signed com
munication, is helpless. It can only express its regret.
The luckless girl driver of the car must still be suffering
agonies that only those who have taken human life acci
dentally can understand. In justice to her, the victim of a
| combination of circumstances beyond her control, circum
stances which Dean Hoover refers to as a "killing," it is
necessary to point out that Dean Hoover apparently is not
aware of the true facts of the accident.
lie charges that the car was going 35 or 10 miles per
hour, that it was passing a bus stopped to discharge pas
sengers at an inlerscction; that il was crossing an inter
section, where the speed limit is If) miles per hour. All
i these, Hoover points out, are violations of law. All. he says,
"deserve pointed comment."
A check of the official police chart of the accident last
! night revealed that there were no skidmarks, indicating
that the speed was less than I5.~) or 10 miles per hour; and
that the bus had stopped If>o feet beyond tlie intersection,
where the speed limit is 2.~> inilees per hour and where a
pedestrian has not an undisputed right-of-way.
Dean Hoover's reference lo yesterday's "facetious" edi
torial on Palo Alto law enforcement is inconsequential,
though it does seem a bit out of place in view of the fact
that said editorial made no mention of the accident and
intended no connection between the campus tragedy and
Palo Alto law enforcement.
The important thing is to protect a woman student who
would suffer additional grief if the mistaken public obser
vations of a man of respected authority were allowed to
pass uncorrected.

Palo Alto law enforcement.

One column lo the left, on lliis page, is a communication
to the Daily from Theodore J. Hoover, Dean of the en
i gineering school and brother of the President of the I nited
States. It is not about engineering, however, the field in
j which Dean Hoover is unquestionably an outstanding
authority.
It is about speed, about killers operating vehicles in
this community, about the inadequacy of our present legal
machinery to deal with those killers, -about the inability
j of undergraduates to drive sanely, and about facetious edi
torials and failure of the press to give more publicity to
; the tragic accident on Palm Drive last week, the accident
i which resulted in the death of a prominent professor.
*
It is untortunate that Dean Hoover chose this moment
to air publicly his displeasure with the manner in which
the police handled the case. So soon after the death, pub
licity will undoubtedly bring additional grief to the girl
! who has been completely exonerated of fault, and to the
wife and mother of the victim. The press realized this
i when it purposely avoided giving undue prominence to the
unhappy affair.
