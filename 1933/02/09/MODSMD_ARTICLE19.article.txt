# Tentative Burlingame Match To Open Tennis
## 
### 
Starting the winter schedule,
Coach Lockwood plans a tentative
match with the Burlingame Tennis
Club on February 18.
With an even-balanced squad and
close competition for the last two
singles assignments, Lockwood has
no major worries about picking the
six best netmen this season.
Right now, Dan Ellis, Hugh But
ler, and Howard Blethen are all
putting up some stiff tennis in at
tempts to squeeze into the sixth
place. Blethen, a newcomer, and an
other left-handed player whose
looping game is causing the other
two men plenty of worry sems to
hold the advantage. However, Ellis
is rapidly getting into last season's
form, and Butler will undoubtedly
make a strong bid.
