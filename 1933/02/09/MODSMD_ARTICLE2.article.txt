# Six Bids Left For Toyon Hop
## 
### 
With only six bids left unsold, the
Toyon Winter Formal scheduled for I
0 o'clock tomorrow night has shat- |
tered all campus records for an
early dance sellout. The handsome j
red Morocco leather programs j
should arrive today, and they, with j
the few bids, can be obtained at the
A.S.S U. office or in room 222 Toyon
Hall. The bids are selling for three 1
dollars per couple.
Emphasizing that no roughs or
any other crashers will be allowed
admittance to the dance without
bids, the committee stated last night
that there will be sufficient room for
those who pay, to dance. Bunny
Burson and his noted ten-piece Bal
Tabarin orchestra is furnishing the |
music.
