# STANFORD LAW SCHOOL OFFERS 4-YEAR COURSE
## Students Enter In Senior Year On Completion Of Pre-requisites FIRST ON WEST COAST Average Of 2.5 Required For Admission 
### 
Inauguration of a new program of
study in which the law course will
be four years instead of the present
three was announced last night by
Marion R. Kirkwood, dean of the
Stanford School of Law.
"The new course, to be offered
as an alternative, has been insti
tuted because of the large number
of students who have been gradu
ating with LL.B. degrees without
getting all the necessary basic
work," Dean Kirkwood declared.
"The modern law requires a much
more thorough study than three
years can give, and this system will
enable a man to begin the work in
his junior year."
The change is not final, but is a
faculty action intended solely as an
experiment. Stanford is the first
school on the Coast to make the
attempt.
Under the plan, students will en
roll in pre-legal curricula upon
completion of the lower division,
and will do the last two years of
undergraduate study under the su
pervision of law school faculty.
The present first-year law courses
will be offered to students in their
senior year, and those who suc
cessfully complete these will get
their A.B. degrees.
Admission to the new course will
be strictly limited, Kirkwood said.
Students will have to have excep
tional lower division records, the
minimum grade point average being
2.5. The first-year law program re
quirements will be 140 units of
credit with at least a 2.5 average.
Only those who have been regis
tered in pre-legal curriculum dur
ing the junior year or who have
completed substantially the same
course will be admitted. Students at
present registered as juniors will
be admitted to the first-year law
work prior to October 2, 19153, upon
successful completion of 140 units
with a 2.5 grade point average.
