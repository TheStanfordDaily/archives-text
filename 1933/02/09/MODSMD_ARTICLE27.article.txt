# PALO ALTO'S DRAGNET
## 
### 
Well, il begins to look like the nexl step will lie a re
turn to "vigilante" discipline, willi the Palo Alio police as
avenging night-riders. Certainly yesterday's trallie fiasco
in Palo Alto was reminiscent of the not quite forgotten days
w hen motorcycle cops used to hide in the hushes along the
highway. ,
Yesterday's record of ninety-seven arrests for trallie
v iolations is indicative of other Palo Alto police practices,
previously objected for example, the watchful waiting of
night cops outside all-night restaurants, where the law
wails lor the raising of a voice or the scraping of" chairs
as an excuse lo search ears for intoxicating liquor.
The letter of the law was the rule in Palo Alto yester
day. 1 hat literal an interpretation of trallie ordinances is
legally and logically justifiable, bul the manner in which
the local blue-coats went about their enforcement was un
necessarily irksome.
The spirit of law is co-operation among citizens for their
mutual protection and benefit. Surely the Palo Alto traf
fic dragnet could have aroused no co-operative spirit among
motorists of the community. From a strictly campus stand
point, it's probably pretty fortunate for the town auto
mobile-hawks that thev don't give an annual Policemen's
Hall.
