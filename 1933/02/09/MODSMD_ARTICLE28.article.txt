						VANISHING TRADITION

### 
The Arboretum, which is famous in Stanford history
for being the traditional spot where love-sick students
stroll about in the moonlight (ttie last recorded couple seen
in the Arboretum dates around 1!>07) is fast disappearing
under the strokes of the axe.
Incidentally, the Arboretum was considered, at one
lime, lo be the finest in the country. Encouraged by the
enthusiasm of Doctor Jordan, this outdoor museum flour
ished and prospered for many years. Trees and plants of
exceedingly rare groups could be found growing on the
Farm.
A lack of funds, combined with a lack of water from
the heavens, slowly undermined the health of these ex
hibits. Last year it was announced that the great percent
age of the specimens were suffering from an incurable
disease. In order lo protect the few remaining healthy
trees, the sick members had to be cut down.

Although very few people have any accurate knowledge
of the use of arboreta, there is practically 110 one who
would not rise in defense of this most attractive form of
museum. The scholars can get their intellectual pleasure
from the study of the specimens, while the layman can
enjoy, without any special knowledge, the wonders that lie
sees there.
II is encouraging to know that in the permanent plans
for the University's development a plot of land lying be
hind Frenchman's hill has been reserved for a bigger and
liner Arboretum.
