They're singing it now. "Buy American," roar llic
drums. "Buy American," drone the saxophones. "Buy
American," laugh the trumpets. The trumpets seem to
have a fundamental sense of humor.
It's surprising how many dance orchestras have taken
111> the bleat of this new time. It's surprising how many
singers have learned the words, which they croon without
conviction into the microphone. But the orchestras have
taken up the bleat, and there are lots and lots of people
v ho insist upon dancing, no matter what the tune.
It's even more surprising that a crusading organization
so powerful as the Hearst publishing company wasn't able
to get a better tune and lyric to express its pet theory of
economics. In that surprise may lurk the lirst evidence of
sanity to be discovered in the entire mad situation. The
chances are that the most capable tune and lyric composers
wouldn't fool around with the idea, proving that even a
person so remotely conscious of the actual economic situa
tion as a song writer wouldn't subscribe to such a stupid
slogan as "Buy American."
But "Buy American," the song, has the form and ap
pearance of a musical composition, and people are sing
ing il. Somebody ought to write music for the satirically
poetic reply to "Buy Americanism" printed recently on this
page. The trouble with that idea is that the really intelli
gent and capable minds seldom organize, even to the ex
lenl which would be necessary lo publish a song.
