# BULL SESSION

I was baffled the other evening—
yes, baffled completely. I walked
into a movie house and flicking on
the canvas was some sort of film
entertainment. I was reasonably
sure of that. What baffled me was
that aftei 1 sitting quietly for several
minutes, I still couldn't tell whether
I was seeing a comedy or a tragedy.
My situation was serious.

The faces of the people around me
offered little help. Some were
smirking. Some were duly serious.
Some were puzzled. Most of them
wore the customary dead pan of the
average film fan. I determined to
find out whether 1 was seeing a
comedy or a tragedy. I resolved to
discover, if possible, if I was sup
posed to feel sorry or happy. The
uncertainty was terrifying. Imagine,
paying to see a movie and then not
knowing what you were seeing. II
was clearly against the Interstate
Commerce Commission.

I began to laugh uproariously—al
nothing in particular, at the screen
in general, but with the sly selfish
purpose of finding out what it was
that I was seeing. A few sympa
thetic snickers echoed back across .
the darkness. My suspicions were'
aroused. I, (then, knew, however,
that I was not seeing a conscious
comedy.
I tried a hiss. Its success was im
mediate. The audience was like a
pen of stuttering snakes in a min
ute. The hissing continued to the ,
end of the picture—which, fortun
ately, was not long. It was now easy
to deduce that I was seeing a pro
duction that had been planned as a
tragedy—was forced upon the people
as a tragedy—but which they were
refusing in good American style.
"Infant. Industry" they call Holly
wood. If such courage they show in
their crib I hope they never leave
their rubber rompers. What con
summate courage it must take to
foist such stuff on the public. A
highwayman (romantic for thug)
takes your money but you know
why. The blonde (I suppose she was
a blonde) took my coin at the win
dow and if I hadn't taken the initi
ative to find out, I never would ;
have known why.
When they show us the celluloid
tragedies of yesterday, we giggle at
the horrible spectacle. If we hiss the

HOLLYWOOD—LAND OF COURAGE

movie dramas of our own day, what
will posterity do when they see
them? We must think of posterity.
We do with such mundane things
as pine trees. It is infinitely more
important that we keep our chil
dren's children from dying in hys
terical laughter at the sight and
sound of the reels and reels of junk
we now turn out.
The depression is hurting the
movie business—but so is the movie
business. There was a time when a
person went to a movie because of
the novelty of films—like arching
the neck at an airplane. That day is
gone. The movies must produce—
not just film away until the sun
goes down or the arc lights need
replacing. —Abe Mellinkoff
