### OLD DR. ALGAR 
(Interview by Mrs. Fowler Mc- |
Cormick, the former Anne "Fifi" i
Urquehart Stillmun, one-time wife
of James A. Stillman, New York
banker, who is being sued for $200,-
000 for alienating the affections of
the wife of a Canadian politician.)
"Mr. Slillman prefers the type of
girl that gets him into messes, so
why should he complain about the
cost? . . . There is something wrong
with James A.'s heart. It seems to
heat out of tune, and I have de
cided it is congenital and there is
nothing to be done about it."
