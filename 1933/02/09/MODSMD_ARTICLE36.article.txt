THE FILM SHORT SUBJECT

One of the major offenses of the
Third Largest Industry is the whole
' sale manufacture of little side
dishes which are served in the
theatres along with the feature and
are more familiarly known as
shorts. Realizing that the public as
a rule comes to see the main pic
ture, the producers and exhibitors
feel that they can present ihird
rate guff which will simply round
out the bill and give the patron his
money's worth in quantity, if not
I in quality. The general result is that
the patron is so limp by the time
the feature appears that he is in no
condition to enjoy it at all. Let it be
said at the outset that the situation
in Palo Alto is neither better nor
worse than elsewhere; surely the
theatres can't help what Hollywood
sends them.
Perhaps the mast innocuous type
of short subjects is the newsreel,
strictly speaking not a true short
subject. The calibre of the newsreel
has of late improved, until now we
often have real items of interest, and
less tendency toward lengthy and
uninteresting items.
That aged form of short subject,
the comedy short, does not bear its
j years very gracefully. Today we are
being shown the same gags which
amused the last generation—the pie
throwing, the revolving door, the
mistaken identity, people falling off
almost anything, and the like. Plot
is unheard of; the only straw to
cling to is the hope of an occasional
new gag, or possibly a bit of genu
inely clever dialogue. Comedy teams
have come into vogue, with varying
success: Zasu Pitts and Thelma Todd
are sometimes funny, as are Laurel
and Hardy, but the long reels of
marital quarrels are no longer very
amusing.
Sound has remade the art of the
animated cartoon, the greatest ori
ginality and success has been
achieved in that field. Outstanding

is Walt Disney with his Mickey
Mouse, which made an instant hit
and has maintained its original
merits. Disney's Silly Symphonies
exhibit even more skill, involving
as they do the close synchroniza
tion of sound and action.
The combining of Technicolor
with the sound cartoon has pro
duced the finest type of short sub
' ject since the advent of sound. Dis
ney again is credited with this move,
and his first, "Trees and Flowers,"
was wholly delightful—from the
standpoint of entertainment as well
as technique. The most recent of
these was a charming sequence laid
in "Santa's Workshop."
With the success of Mickey Mouse
and his playmates came a flood of
imitations—some as good, and many
far inferior. Standardization has be
come the inevitable result, and the
rule now seems that the cat, dog,

or mouse heroine is abducted by
the c, d, or m villain and pursued
for some time by the c, d, or m hero,
who ultimately rescues her. The
cartoon, however, still remains the
most popular short, and it is a field
with many possibilities.
The travel short, though over
worked, is still a source of enter
tainment and fairly painless instruc
tion. The most menacing thing
about these is the announcer's
abandoned injection of puns.
The sports and musical shorts are
good on occasion, especially the for
mer, which have a wide popular
appeal. The musicals are inclined to
exploit inferior tunes amidst over
elaborate settings.
With the shorts situation as it is,
the smart theatregoers will stay at
home until the feature begins—or
perhaps stay at home. —Chapin
