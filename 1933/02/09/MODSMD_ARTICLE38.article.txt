AMONG THE HIGH-POWERED
industries developed by the Machine
Age is the prize-fighting industry,
which is based upon Barnum's prin
ciple of fooling some of the people
all of the time and which produces i
box-fights in reverse ratio to the
prices paid to see them.
'111is is a very well organized
industry that has a union of
entrepreneurs and laborers and
that pays high returns in spite
of the shoddy merchandise that
is peddled to a public that has
not learned that a box-light can
be appreciated without a ticket
and without field glasses via the
radio in the living-room of the
old homestead. The laborers are
paid in proportion to their abil
ity to draw crowds through the
turnstiles and not in proportion
to their bo\-f:ghling ability, r.nd
I lie (yitreprencurs are paid in
proportion to their lung power.
THE UNfON of the box-fighting j
industry is ;i closed shop affair that
looks with righteous disfavor on
amateur or foolish box-fighters who |
fighl because they enjoy fighting and
who receive nothing except black
eyes and cut lips for their cxer- j
t ions. These amateur box-fighters J
are con idered scab workers, and
are ostracized from Ihe best box
fighting society.
The amateurs are also con
sidered very poor laborers, prob
ably 011 the principle that a
lighter who is crazy enough not
to get paid for lighting must be
so crazy as to be unable to
well. This is logical ballyhoo
whose only fault! is that it is not
true.
THE AMATEUR BOX-FIGHT- j
ERS, who arc so foolish as not to j
particularly desire to climb socially j
among the regular union box-light
ers, are too foolish to realize that j
their box-fighting efforts should cor- j
respond to the price paid for ihem,
and therefore these scab wotkers
light as well as they are able and
have no alibis when they are de
feated and no boasts when they win. I
It is obvious that this situa
tion proves the lunacy of the
amateur box-fighters and it also
explains why the public pays to
see poor professional box-fights
when it could see good amateur j
box-lights for nothing or for a |
fraction of the cost of watching
the unions boys grin on each
others' shoulders for ten rounds.
Harnum's quoted remark can
also be explained by this situa- t
tion. hut that is beside the point.
Tonight in the Pavilion a group of ;
very good amateur box-fighters j
(who are scab workers and proud
of it) will belt each other around !
for the pure pleasure of it. They
will represent Stanford and the
California Aggies, and they are such
queer ducks that they still believe j
in the antiquated idea of good i
sportsmanship.
And the Stanford community,
that never has agreed with Bar
man. will be foolish enough to
watch these scab workers get
black eyes and cut lips because
tlicy enjoy hitting and being hit.
While a more sophisticated and
mechanized community would
reasonably have their money to
pay the union boys for their in
dustrialized labor. —I).S.

AMONG THE HIGH-POWERED
industries developed by the Machine
Age is the prize-fighting industry,
which is based upon Barnum's prin
ciple of fooling some of the people
all of the time and which produces i
box-fights in reverse ratio to the
prices paid to see them.
'111is is a very well organized
industry that has a union of
entrepreneurs and laborers and
that pays high returns in spite
of the shoddy merchandise that
is peddled to a public that has
not learned that a box-light can
be appreciated without a ticket
and without field glasses via the
radio in the living-room of the
old homestead. The laborers are
paid in proportion to their abil
ity to draw crowds through the
turnstiles and not in proportion
to their bo\-f:ghling ability, r.nd
I lie (yitreprencurs are paid in
proportion to their lung power.
THE UNfON of the box-fighting j
industry is ;i closed shop affair that
looks with righteous disfavor on
amateur or foolish box-fighters who |
fighl because they enjoy fighting and
who receive nothing except black
eyes and cut lips for their cxer- j
t ions. These amateur box-fighters J
are con idered scab workers, and
are ostracized from Ihe best box
fighting society.
The amateurs are also con
sidered very poor laborers, prob
ably 011 the principle that a
lighter who is crazy enough not
to get paid for lighting must be
so crazy as to be unable to
well. This is logical ballyhoo
whose only fault! is that it is not
true.
THE AMATEUR BOX-FIGHT- j
ERS, who arc so foolish as not to j
particularly desire to climb socially j
among the regular union box-light
ers, are too foolish to realize that j
their box-fighting efforts should cor- j
respond to the price paid for ihem,
and therefore these scab wotkers
light as well as they are able and
have no alibis when they are de
feated and no boasts when they win. I
It is obvious that this situa
tion proves the lunacy of the
amateur box-fighters and it also
explains why the public pays to
see poor professional box-fights
when it could see good amateur j
box-lights for nothing or for a |
fraction of the cost of watching
the unions boys grin on each
others' shoulders for ten rounds.
Harnum's quoted remark can
also be explained by this situa- t
tion. hut that is beside the point.
Tonight in the Pavilion a group of ;
very good amateur box-fighters j
(who are scab workers and proud
of it) will belt each other around !
for the pure pleasure of it. They
will represent Stanford and the
California Aggies, and they are such
queer ducks that they still believe j
in the antiquated idea of good i
sportsmanship.
And the Stanford community,
that never has agreed with Bar
man. will be foolish enough to
watch these scab workers get
black eyes and cut lips because
tlicy enjoy hitting and being hit.
While a more sophisticated and
mechanized community would
reasonably have their money to
pay the union boys for their in
dustrialized labor. —I).S.
