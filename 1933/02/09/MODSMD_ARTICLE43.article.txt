# WINGED-O SIGNS SCHALDACH FOR RUGBY CONTEST
## California Star Will Battle Ernie Caddel As Cards Meet Olympic Club 
### 
Hank Schaldaeh against Ernie
Caddel!
The rip-roaring right half of the
Cardinals versus the little man with
the long name from the Golden
Bears. That's the treat rugby fans
have in store Saturday at Ewing
Field in San Francisco when the
Stanford Rugby Club meets the
Olympic Club team.
Rossi To Kick Off
Big Ernie Caddel has recently
been working out with Norm
Cleaveland and the rest of the Stan
ford boys and from all advance no
tices will be just as spectacular as
gentlemen Johnny Reisner, Bobby
Grayson, and Bill Sim. Schaldaeh
has agreed to appear with the Olym
pians.
Mayor Rossi of San Francisco ex
pects to be on hand for the kick-off
ceremony, and that dignified offi
cial is billed to execute the kick.
And as an additional attraction
"Dink" Templeton will be at the
microphone of the public address
system to describe the play. Dud
DeGroot will referee, and the whole
show may be seen for twenty-five
j cents.
Two More Tilts Scheduled
The proposed game with Califor
nia is now definitely scheduled for
February 4. U.C. has a squad of
forty-five men out, including Castro,
Pasco, Tozier, and others from the
Blue and Gold football team.
Also Stanford has two tentative
matches in view, one a return game
with the Olympic squad and an
other with a Southern crew, prob
ably the Reds of Pasadena.
