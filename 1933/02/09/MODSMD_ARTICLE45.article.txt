# CARDS FAVORED TO DOWN BEARS IN WATER POLO
## Don Kinkead, Burke Knapp Expected To Bolster Indian Defense 
### 
It will be the league leaders
against the tail-enders Saturday af
ternoon when Stanford's varsity
water polo team plays California in
the local pool.
The Indians have beaten both the
Olympic Club and Athens Club
while the Bears have been defeated
by these same two teams. However,
all of the games have been close,
hard-fought contests and Stanford
will have no set-up Saturday.
Strong Guards
One of the strongest players on
the Card team, and one who has
received the least publicity, is Don
Kinkead, center back. Kinkead, be
cause of his position, seldom gets
an opportunity to score, but plays
a steady, brilliant game, all the
time. He is considered one of the
strongest guards in the league.
Another important factor in Stan
ford's defense is the work of Captain
Burke Knapp at goal guard. Picked
on the first all-Pacific Coast team
last year, Knapp has been playing
better than ever this season. His
work against the Athens Club was
especially outstanding.
Lineup Unchanged
Other Indian players who will
start Saturday are: Ted Wiget, Jim
Triolo, and either Jim Benet or
Dick Hirsch at forwai'd; Vlad Tara
nik and Gordy Graves, guards. Leo
Cook will also probably see action
at goal guard.
California's biggest threats arc
Captain Fred Kothe and Jim Mc-
Kay. These two have carried the
brunt of the Bear attack in previ
ous games this year.
