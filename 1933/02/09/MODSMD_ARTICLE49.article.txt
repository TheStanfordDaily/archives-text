# FRESHMAN WATER POLOISTS TO MEET SEQUOIA MERMEN
## Cards Raring To Go After Inactivity; Tough Opponent Today 
### 
Raring to go after a week of in
activity, Stanford's freshman water
polo team meets the Sequoia High
School Alumni at 4:20 o'clock this
afternoon in Encina pool. The eon
test, which is not open to the public,
will be a tough one for the Babes
in that the invaders boast of a
lineup which during its high-school
days won the Northern California
championship three years in a row.

Inasmuch as the Berkeley battle
will be held in the near future,
Coach Nort Thornton has gone out
of his team's class in an effort to
secure really tough competition be
fore the "little big game.'" Although
the Sequoia outfit will be favored to
win, they will also be handicapped
by lack of practice. Stanford's only
hope of victory lies in the fact that
the alumni will possibly wilt in the
second half due to poor condition.
Undecided as yet about his open
ing forward combination. Coach
Thornton will probably start his
lineup composed of Danforth, Ruli
son, and either Ludlum or Viney at
the front line positions; Captain
Myers, Baxter, and Woodard at
guards; and Livingston at the goal
guard post.
Rulison has been the scoring ace
of late while Livingston and Cap
tain Myers have been outstanding
on defense.
