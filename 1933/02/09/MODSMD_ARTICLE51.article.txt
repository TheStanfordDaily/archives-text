Athletic controversies and stories
predominate in the new issue, with
a number of articles by present and
past campus leaders. A1 Masters

well-known writer of the Daily's
"Bull Session."
In addition there is an account of
the basketball squad's tour of the
Midwest by Don Cameron and an
article on rugby at Stanford by

freshmen at Stanford, and a large
collection of edtiorials, campus
events, club notes, and news of the
classes.
