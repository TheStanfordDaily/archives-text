Dear Sir:
The tragic killing of Professor Theodore Dunn would
seeeni to eall for more serious consideration than that
given it in your facetious editorial on law enforcement.
The unhappy young inoinan who was the cause of the
tragedy deserves sympathy and suffers next to the wife
and the mother, but she is the product of the times which
condones trailic law violations. The fact that there were
four persons on the seat of the car in violation of one state
law; also that the car was going at the rate of 35 or 10 miles
an hour in passing a public vehicle stopped to discharge
passengers at an intersection, in violation of another state
law; and also that it was at an intersection of streets where
the speed limit is 15 miles an hour as a third violation;
these all deserve pointed comment.

Here was a highly educated, talented, genial, gentle
man in the prime of life with fifteen years of good service
to the University ahead of him, annihilated instantly for
no adequate reason whatever; it was simply an insane
sacrifice to speed, to save in triple violation of the l;i\v, less
than thirty seconds in total time between the gates and
the campus.

I am completely unable to see why we tolerate this
! situation on the University campus, like a lot of silly sheep,
when we have ample power to protect ourselves. 1 am
further unable to see why any student under the status of
post-graduate should he allowed to have or to operate a
car on the campus at all. I lived in Palo Alto for four
years as a student, and walked to the University and back
every day to the benefit of myself and no damage to Hie
public. I am strongly in favor of the same system.
Not the least objectionable feature of the episode has
been the attempt; of the press to minimize the flagrance of
the killing, either by suppression of fact, or bv willful
misstatement; a sort of glossing over, as it were, of a slight
unpleasantness, and proceed, with plenty of speed, to the
next victim. This is not the iirst killing of the faculty and
probably not the last. How about Comptroller Roth, or
the President of the University, or even Registrar Mitchell
or the Padre, or all four as good targets in a continuous
program of exuberant manslaughter?

There are entirely too many killers operating vehicles
in this community; they seem to proceed on the theory
that pedestrians have no rights at all on the highways and
streets, when as a matter of fact, which the killers do not
seem to know, the pedestrian has all the rights at intersec
tions. Any expostulation when you have to jump for your
life, nets you at best a silly laugh, and at worst a curse for
your clumsiness. A count any day at any intersection on
the campus will reveal from one to four violations per
minute of either the speed limits, parking regulations, or
the rights of pedestrians at street intersections.
