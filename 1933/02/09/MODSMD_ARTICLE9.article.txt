# Yearling Hoopsters Meet Menlo J.C. Five Tomorrow
## 
### 
Two vastly improved quintets,
Menlo Junior College and the Stan
ford freshmen, meet tomorrow night
in the preliminary game to the In
dian varsity-U.S.C. clash. The pre
liminary game on Saturday will pit
Jimmy Bradshaw's yearlings against
a dark horse five from Fresno High.
Menlo's already slim chances of
beating the freshmen will take an
other serious drop if two injured
stars, Arne Anderson, forward, and
Jack Clumeck, center, are unable to
play. Anderson was not counted on
to play a full forty minutes, but
Clumeck was not incapacitated until
the Marin Junior College game last
week. Campus fans will watch with
interest Henry Coiner, who played
last year for the Stanford freshmen,
and is now on the Menlo J.C. five.
Coiner is a fine, scrappy player.
