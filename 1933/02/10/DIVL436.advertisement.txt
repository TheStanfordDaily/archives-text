Stanfrock Hose
guaranteed satisfaction
Can you tell a good silk stocking from one not so good
just by looking at itP
We can't!
But the manufacturer knows.
That is why we went to America's leading mills for
our Stanfrock Brand. We asked the manufacturer to
mak£ us a line of hose that he guarantees.
I lis guarantee backs up every pair we sell, and covers
these five important points:
(1 ) Stanfrock Hose will not run from ordinary wear
—hose not actually cut will be cheerfully replaced and
without question, if they run;
(2) Stanfrock heels and toes will not break through
from ordinary wear;
(3) Stanfrock colors will stand repeated washings
without fading;
(4) Stanfrock sheerness is permanent — it will not
wash out;
(5) Stanfrock lustre will not wear nor wash off.
Superior in wearability,
appearance and construction
There are six good reasons why Stanfrock Hose are
certain to give you satisfaction and long wear:
WIDE WELT—wider than other stockings selling for
more. Durable ribbonette run-stop prevents garter
runs.
FLAT SEAMS—adding to beautiful appearance of
Stanfrock Hose.
CLEAR, UNIFORM COLOR—no streaks or bars in
knitting.
TRIPLE SILK HEEL GUARD—three strands of yarn
in construction.
TRIPLE TOE—extra long wearing.
