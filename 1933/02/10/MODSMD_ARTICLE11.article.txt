j "Going native" on a South Sea
I island is not the heaven on earth it's
! cracked up to be.
This information, important to
j collegiates who desire to "drop
| everything and get away from
it all," comes from widely-traveled
Dr. Albert W. Herre of the Stanford
Museum.
Dr. Herre says: "To the tourist
the islands of the East seem full of
glamor, the home of romance and
beauty, full of the lure of the un
known. The half-naked villagers,
decorated rather than clothed in
lavishly gaudy garments, add to the
attraction and mystery.
"The casual visitor, surrounded by
the luxury of a steamer, gazes at
the half-concealed nippa-bamboo
cottages ashore and sighs for an
idyllic life in a palm-embowered
love-nest. Yearning for life, the
American indulges in vague dreams
of love with a thrilling soul com
panion who carries one away from

the prosaic world to dwell beneath
the dense canopy of a cocoanut
grove beside the jewel-like beauty
of a coral reef.
"There he expects that the per
fume of glowing orchids, the song
of golden orioles and the cooing of
pigeons will lull his senses while he
feeds on the honey-dew of love.
"As a matter of fact these dream
ers, deprived of ice and a rich varied
diet, cut off from bridge and teas,
could not stand existence on one of
these lone coral isles. Only the na
turalist or one rich in inner re
sources and therefore not afraid to
be alone with himself can enjoy an
extended stay in such places.
"Even among such choice spirits
it is only a few who can overlook
the frequently monotonous diet and
insufficient water supply, and who
can successfully resist intestinal in
fections and parasites; none but
these can really enjoy a prolonged
stay on these 'isles of the coral
studded sea.'"
