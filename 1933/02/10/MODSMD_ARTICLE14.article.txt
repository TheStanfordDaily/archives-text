Sword and Sandals added another
feather to its already feathered cap,
with last night's reading of "The
Play's The Thing," by Ferenc Mol
nar.
Starting off with a fairly slow
tempo, the reading picked up in the
final two acts, with the third occa
sioning especial hilarity.
The major share of the laughs
may be credited to Joe Wolf, who
never missed an opportunity for a
laugh. His timing, except in a few
isolated instances, was perfect, and
his pantomime added much to his
interpretation of the dull actor,
Almady.
Mrs. Peg Converse was an at
tractive and clever heroine, and in
jected much humor into her read
ing. Bill Lyons gave his reading of
Sandor Turai less broadness than
the other players, with the result
that his laughs were not so pro
nounced as some, but he was effec
tive in his domination of a difficult
situation.
Carter Meyer, through skillful
reading and pantomime, garnered
many more laughs than his part
warranted and gave an excellent
reading of Mansky. James Benet
was exceptional in his reading of
the young lover, infusing the part
with appropriate restraint.
Robert Brauns drew much com
edy from the role of Dwornitschek,
as did James McElney from the sec
retary's lines. Jane Desenberg's
reading of stage directions was per
fectly timed, and most effective.
