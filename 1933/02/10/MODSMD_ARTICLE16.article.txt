SACRAMENTO, Feb. 9 ,W J I -
Three bandits committed a daring
robbery here tonight on the main
post office, fired a wild shot into the
air, and escaped with a mail pouch
estimated to contain $325,000 in
bonds and cash.
They held up W. E. Williams, re
lief guard, and Claus Swanson, mail
truck driver, on the rear landing of
the postoffice, located in the heart
of the city.
While one man covered the im
mediate vicinity with a gun, a sec
ond threatened Williams as he re
moved the pouch from the post of
fice, and the third forced Swanson
to sit on a hand truck with his head
turned away.
