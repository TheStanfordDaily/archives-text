# Toyon Scene Of Formal Tonight
## 
### 
With plans completed, bids nearly
all sold, and programs here, the
Toyon Winter Formal will start at
9 o'clock this evening when Bunny
Burson's orchestra breaks into the
first of a four-hour series of Stan
ford-popular harmony.
The lobby of Toyon Hall has been
transformed into a Moroccan pal
ace. There are rustic iron partitions
in the center arches of the inner
lobby; there is a deep blue black
drape behind the orchestra; there is
indirect lighting of the Toyon ceil
ing; there are flowers and a Moorish
lounge and an imitation minaret and
color wheels.
Passing out free cigarettes will be
a Stanford man dressed as a Moor
ish slave; passing out free punch
and cookies will be two other cos
tumed Stanfordites; and even the
ticket-checker will be dressed in
accord with the dance's motif.
