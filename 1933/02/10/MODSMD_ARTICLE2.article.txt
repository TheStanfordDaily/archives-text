reforestation, reclamation, water power, and agricultural rehabilitation. Development of fertilizer possibilities at Muscle Shoals was included in

at Muscle Shoals can be increased to between two and three million horsepower. In addition ho believes the proposition would provide employment
for 200,000 men in the Tennessee valley alone. Picture shows a view of the fertile Tennessee valley as seen from Signal mountain, near Chattanooga.
