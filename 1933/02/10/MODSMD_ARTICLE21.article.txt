# B.A.C. Meet Tonight Airs Coach Tangle
## 
### Bob Letts 
The football coaching staff "tan
gle," which has kept Stanford stu
dents and alumni guessing since the
j appointment of Head Coach Tiny
Thornhill and Chief Assistant Ernie
I Nevers last month, is expected to
i be straightened out when members
of the Board of Athletic Control
j meet here this evening.
Dinner at G o'clock in the Old
I Union will be followed by a session
; in the BA.C. building which is ex
pected to last until about 9 o'clock.
To Elect Coaches
Selection of a varsity end coach
i and a head freshman mentor are
j the principle points to be aired, with
; the naming of assistant freshman
coaches and members of the "Gray"
j staff as subordinate issues. Other
! problems to be gone over are the
reorganization of the varsity base
| ball schedule and several matters
! concerning minor sports.
Leading candidates for the end
i coach's job are said to be Jim Law
j son, Stanford all-American end in
1 1924; Ted Shipkey, another all-
American wingman of the next
i year; and "Spud" Harder, '28, vie
| tim of the last St. Mary's game and
I a stellar player in his college days.
Lawson is in business in Palo Afto,
while the others have been coaching
—Shipkey at. Arizona Teachers in
Tempe and Harder at Bakersfield
: Junior College.
liabe Mentor—Who?
The head freshman coach's job is
j still up in the air, so far as definite
t knowledge of the case is concerned.
Two weeks ago it looked almost de
cided with Dudley DeGroot, captain
and all-star center in 1923, as the
! man. DeGroot, who last fall boosted
| San Jose State Teachers College
i from the cellar position to co-hold
ers of the Far Western Conference
title, has announced himself to be
•; satisfied with the situation in the
Garden City and not particularly
anxious to change under existing
conditions.
I With DeGroot out of the picture,
if he really is, John Bunn leaps to
, the fore. Bunn, who at present is
busy with varsity baSketball here,
was assistant freshman coach and
chief scout for "Pop" Warner last
| autumn. No other names have been
! prominently brought forth.
As many of the present staff as
! possible will be retained, according
to an announcement issued by
i Thornhill after a recent meeting
with the B.A.C. staff committee. No
big shakeup is anticipated.
