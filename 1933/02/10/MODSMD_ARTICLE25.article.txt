# U.S.C.-CARDINAL HOOP CONTEST MAY BE UPSET
## Hopes Are For Record Win, Break Losing Streak In Trojan Game TEAM STILL 'IN CELLAR' Cordry, Hancock Will Star For Indians In Tilt Here Tonight 
### Dick Strouse 
With a marked desire and also
somewhat of a chance to climb out
of the Conference cellar, Stanford';;
basketball team faces U.S.C. here
tonight and tomorrow night in two
games that are sure to be hard
fought and may be well-played.
Spasmodically good throughout,
the season, Stanford played its best
basketball in the previous pair of
games with the Trojans. Stanford
outplayed bouncing Sam Barry's
boys in both contests, but lost 25
to 30 and 3G to 38. In fact, Stanford
has come closer than any other Con
ference five to defeat the unde
feated Trojans.
Cards in Cellar
All of which means that the lend
ers of the Southern division of the
Conference may find that the tail
enders will forget their standing and
record a victory and perhaps two.
Stanford is at present tied with
U.C.L.A. for reverse honors, and
any mathematician can figure out
the Card standing in case California
beats the Uelans twice while Stan
lord is splitting with the Trojans.
Stanford's chances really depend
on the degree of warmth of Captain
Tom Cordry and John Hancock.
Keith Topping and Hal Edelcn are
usually good for about eight, field
goals between them per game via
the tip-in method, and Jay Tod has
developed the useful habit of drop
ping in some five free throws a
game.
Cordry May Star
Which means that Stanford's ul
timate score will be determined
roughly by the number of field goals
scored by Cordry and Hancock. In
recent games, both of these lumin
aries have been off in their shoot
ing, thus putting the scoring burden
on Topping and Edelen and Carrel
Weaver when he is in the game.
It must be remembered that
Cordry scored from all over the
court in the first U.S.C. game and
that Hancock scored five field goals
in the second. It has been the con
tention of this writer that if, in any
one game, both Cordry and H.mcock
were hot and Topping and Edelcn
were following up the shots, Stan
ford could and would defeat any
Conference team by ten points.
Stanford Lineup
Stanford's lineup will, obviously,
include Cordry, Topping, Edelcn,
Hancock, and Tod, with Weaver in
instant reserve. It is difficult to
name a Trojan team since even its
coach is not sure of his starters, but
since both Jerry Nemer and Lee
Guttero are sure to play, the other
three men are not so important.
Nemer, who scored no less than
29 points against Stanford in previ
ous games, is the Coast's best bas
ketball player. And Guttero ac
counted for 15 points himself.
The piccolo reaches the highest
note among wind instruments.

on the degree of warmth of Captain
Tom Cordry and John Hancock.
Keith Topping and Hal Edelcn are
usually good for about eight, field
goals between them per game via
the tip-in method, and Jay Tod has
developed the useful habit of drop
ping in some five free throws a
game.
Cordry May Star
Which means that Stanford's ul
timate score will be determined
roughly by the number of field goals
scored by Cordry and Hancock. In
recent games, both of these lumin
aries have been off in their shoot
ing, thus putting the scoring burden
on Topping and Edelen and Carrel
Weaver when he is in the game.
It must be remembered that
Cordry scored from all over the
court in the first U.S.C. game and
that Hancock scored five field goals
in the second. It has been the con
tention of this writer that if, in any
one game, both Cordry and H.mcock
were hot and Topping and Edelcn
were following up the shots, Stan
ford could and would defeat any
Conference team by ten points.
Stanford Lineup
Stanford's lineup will, obviously,
include Cordry, Topping, Edelcn,
Hancock, and Tod, with Weaver in
instant reserve. It is difficult to
name a Trojan team since even its
coach is not sure of his starters, but
since both Jerry Nemer and Lee
Guttero are sure to play, the other
three men are not so important.
Nemer, who scored no less than
29 points against Stanford in previ
ous games, is the Coast's best bas
ketball player. And Guttero ac
counted for 15 points himself.
The piccolo reaches the highest
note among wind instruments.
With a marked desire and also
somewhat of a chance to climb out
of the Conference cellar, Stanford';;
basketball team faces U.S.C. here
tonight and tomorrow night in two
games that are sure to be hard
fought and may be well-played.
Spasmodically good throughout,
the season, Stanford played its best
basketball in the previous pair of
games with the Trojans. Stanford
outplayed bouncing Sam Barry's
boys in both contests, but lost 25
to 30 and 3G to 38. In fact, Stanford
has come closer than any other Con
ference five to defeat the unde
feated Trojans.
Cards in Cellar
All of which means that the lend
ers of the Southern division of the
Conference may find that the tail
enders will forget their standing and
record a victory and perhaps two.
Stanford is at present tied with
U.C.L.A. for reverse honors, and
any mathematician can figure out
the Card standing in case California
beats the Uelans twice while Stan
lord is splitting with the Trojans.
Stanford's chances really depend
on the degree of warmth of Captain
Tom Cordry and John Hancock.
