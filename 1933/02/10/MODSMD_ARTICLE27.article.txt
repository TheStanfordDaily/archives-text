Nominated lor llic ranks ol' "life's most pathetic fii»- j
nres" the man w ho awaits the hell tower chimes as the I
signal for a last minute dash to catch a train, not realizing!
that the odds are ten to one against his making it. "Now,"
strange as it seems, mynns no fewer than three different ;
times on the Stanford campus.
Indeed there are few hereabout who know the correct
answer to that patent old query "What time is it ?" l'ni- j
versity time, with its electric hell signals, sends the student I
slouching to his seat in lecture room, then awakens him at
the conclusion of the lecture. Alter the noon signal, about
as long afterward as it takes the average student to walk
from Memorial Church to the t'nion, the hells in the tower!
chime the hour. Then, if the student begins to wonder how
to set his watch, he telephones Western t'nion, from which
he receives a third time.
l ime is no object with most Stanford students, but if
one of them should ever want to make a train, it might not i
he a bad idea for the 1 t'niversity to be up to the minute.
