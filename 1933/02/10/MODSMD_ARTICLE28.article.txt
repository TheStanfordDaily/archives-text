In today's campus opinion appears a letter from Mrs. I
Jennie Stanford Lathrop Watson regarding the raising of!
the tuition fee for students. Mrs. Watson cites the found
ing grant as proof that Senator and Mrs. Stanford wished
that the fee would always be kept low.
One of the provisions of the original grant states: "The [
t'niversity has been endowed with a view of offering in
struction free, or nearly free, that it may resist the tend-!
enev to the stratification of society, by keeping open an 1
avenue w hereby the deserving and exceptional may rise j
through their own efforts from the lowest to the highest |
stations in life."
At one time, when the worry over raising enough funds
to keep the t'niversity going was at its height, Mrs. Stan
ford wrote " had 1 not the t'niversity so close to my heart j
I would relieve myself of this enormous burden and take I
rest and recreation for the next year." The mental, as well
as physical hardship, that Mrs. Stanford endured during
this period so that the spirit of the founding grant might
be maintained, is only too clearly evident.
What was it that made the Trustees raise the tuition? j
The answer is not diflicult. The acquisition by the l'ni- i
versity of the Cooper Medical College and the raising of its !
standards so that it might compete with the best Medical
Schools in the country caused a terrific drain on the avail
able funds. At the lime the school was taken over, there'
was not a single school in the West that maintained high j
standards. The Trustees were faced with the problem of
either letting the chance to acquire a Medical School go by,
or else take over the whole plant. At the time of the acqui
sition it looked as though the "West would never have an
accredited medical school.
Comptroller Roth explained why the University was
forced to raise the tuition from *!>!). the first big jump, to
.$lll. The income of the t'niversity, like the income of I
most individuals, has been materially lessened during the
past few years.
The w hole question seems to revolve about the nil-!
predictable change of conditions. Kveryonc regrets that
the tuition had to be raised, but also no one can blame the
Trustees for wanting to increase the glory of Stanford.
