# SLAMMING TO SUCCESS
## 
### 
Ask every other college graduate to what he owes his
business success, his rise* in a professional field. lit- will i
say that his success may he traced to his formal training
and to his personal ambition and endeavor. Then ask the
others, the ones whose numbers are odd.
These gentlemen, Bachelors of the Art of Living, will
trace their careers along the lines of luck and social sense, i
often pointing particularly to their proficiency on the golf!
links or at the bridge table.
(iolf and bridge, as two games which frequently con
tribute to success and happiness after college, should not ;
be neglected in the course of a university education, (iolf.
;it Stanford, is a one unit course, which is plenty, for the
game is made a pleasure, with a splendid course and ex
pert instruction. Bridge, however, is neglected. Not in!
fraternity houses, certainly, but from the standpoint of
public recognition.
II would probably not be very advisable for the t niver-,
sity to give a course in contract, but somebody, perhaps
the Bridge Club, ought to sponsor an all-University tourna-1
nient. Knowing how lo bid and plnv a hand al one no-.
trump may help some of lis some day.
