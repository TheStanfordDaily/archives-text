# LAGUNITA TESTS NO LONGER GIVEN
## Lifesaving Devices Installed On Campus Lake 
### 
Swimming tests have been entire
ly given up as a means of deciding
a person's fitness to navigate safely
about Lagunita in favor of a pro
vision requiring a lifesaver in every
canoe is the announcement made by
Comptroller Roth's office. The life
savers will be provided at Ihe boat
house and will have a weignt at
tached so that the lifesaver will
mark the place where the canoe
overturned.
A searchlight is to be installed on
the second story of the boathouse
with a beam strong enough to il
luminate the entire lake. A new
light 14-foot rowboat is to be pur
chased for the use of the guards in
case there is any need for help.
The University is making every
provision to insure safety on the
lake but will assume no responsi
bility for the boater's safety. Signs
will be placed in prominent places
about the lake stating this fact.
In line with the attempt to pro
mote safety is the hope that enough
student sentiment will arise to elim
inate imitations of calls for help
which were a source of confusion
last year and delayed relief for those
who actually needed help. Expert
swimmers selected by Ernst Brand
sten, swimming coach, are on guard
constantly from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
