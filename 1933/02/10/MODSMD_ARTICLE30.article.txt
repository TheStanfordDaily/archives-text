# BULL SESSION
## MY IDEAL 
### 
I was a bit perturbed the other
day on not being asked about my
ideal wife. I was even more per
turbed by the answers given in the
Daily. I hope to rectify both per
turbations in one day—today. The
easiest way is to interview myself
on the subject.
I walked briskly up to "Mr. Mel
linkoff, slapped him on the back,
eyed him carefully for a moment,
and then blurted: "What kind of
wife would you like?—not actually,
you know, just some clever 'ideal'
for the Daily." He was off in a
cloud of suffixes, affixes, superla
tives, and comparatives before I
could stop him.
'"Size, oh, something between a
Pi Phi Packard and a Gamma Phi
porch swing—the upholstery of the
former and the easy swing of the
latter," said he, with a gay, devil
may-care toss of the head, a raising
of the left eyebrow, and a slow ris
ing and falling of the upper torso.
"Brains, oh, yes, they are desirable
but not indispensable. Something
between a Tertiary ground sloth and
Einstein will do. Someone so intel
ligent that she can make me believe
she is running me; but yet so dumb
that she will never suspect that I
am running her."
"Sex, oh, yes, it's necessary.
Something between a sick amoeba
and Clara Bow is desired." Then,
quick as a flash, he added: "After

all, a woman without sex is no
woman. And sex without a woman
is a man. The essential truth should
not blind us to the facts."
'"Hair, oh, yes, 1 couldn't stand a
bald wife. Color isn't as essential as
hair, itself—obviously. The color
should be something between an
anemic albino and straight Union
coffee at 10:30 p.m. The trouble with
brunettes is that they are so dark,
while blondes are so light. Red
heads are obviously too red. A com
bination would probably be a bit
too eccentric."
"Toothpaste, oh yes, I can't stand
the stuff. It's always dropping off
the brush when you're late for eight
o'clocks. My ideal would never use i
it. Teeth are necessary—but only to
keep the upper-lip from rubbing \
one's chin. If a woman must use
toothpaste, let her squeeze it out of
both ends."
Mellinkofi' stopped to take a breath
—his first since the interview be
gan. "Anything else?" I ventured —
fearing and knowing that there
would be something. I was n it dis
appointed—unfortunately.
"All the candidates will put on
bustles and then try to get through
a key-hole. Those that get through
will be shot. Those that don't will
be drowned. All others will be sent
to a. nunnery." The beam of ad- j
mitted cleverness stalked across his j
face. The interview was over.
