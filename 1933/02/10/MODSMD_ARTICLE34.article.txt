THE CABIN IN THE COTTON
(Warner) —At the Varsity Theatre
The plot of this film is, on the
whole, sufficiently well iittecl to the
crusading theme of the novel from
which it was made. But in detail
Hollywood has had its insidious way
and by the time that the hero de
cides to marry the poor, simple maid
who has pursued him clumsily
rather than the charming Southern
aristocrat whose pursuit has, at
least, had the virtue of experience,
an audience is likely to think him
a darned fool.
Plot is not all-important or .suffi
cient to spoil every film: regard the
recent Diamond Lil, well-sustained,
not by its trivial plot, but by Mae
West's characterization of Lil. But
this film has not a sufficiently strong
or intresting central character and,
in presenting the struggle between
cotton planters and pickers, empha
sizes the sentimental and melodra
matic elements of the situation as
well as indicating the problem.
The cast has been well selected;
the types are good. Richard Barthel
mess repeats his characterization of
the simple but honest country boy;
he does it easily. In criticism of so
charming a person as Bette Davis
I am very likely to depend more
upon appearance and manner than
upon acting; but Miss Davis has
done a very* good job, smoothly
utilizing a dialect foreign to her
New England upbringing.
Also on the bill at the Varsity is
"Down To Earth." Will Rogers as
himself comments amusingly upon
current affairs. His pictures are all
alike, his gags arise from the same
bases constantly but he retains the
power to amuse quietly. —Sandoe
"LAWYER MAN" (Warner) —At the
Stanford Theatre.
Not great, but good entertainment:
William Powell and Joan Blondell
in a trivial, fairly obvious, but fast
moving film about what happens to
an inspiring barrister who pays more
attention to ankles than to advice.
The film is rather disconnected,
but through it runs the personality
of the two leads, and their roles are
marked by exceptionally fast action,
and good rapid-fire dialogue. Miss
Blondell's lines just fall short of the
wise-cracking category and amount
to good laughs.
Powell plays an East Side lawyer !
with aspirations which land him on j
the West Side, and successfully in |
a frame-up, a shady practice, the j
D.A.'s office, and finally back on j
the East Side.
Powell's performance trades in j
some of his usual drawing-room !
suavity for a human touch and a \
good characterization, broad but
pleasing.
Miss Blondell is effective, though
there is nothing new about her in- J
terpretation of the pert little secre- j
tary who stands by, not only her j
guns, but the man she loves.
