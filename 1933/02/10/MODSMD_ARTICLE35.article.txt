The Editor. Sir:
In yesterday's Daily there ap
peared two enlightening articles in
regard to traffic law violations, one
b> Dean Hoover and a second by
the student editor, Stewart Craw
ford. Mr. Iloover's article was both
pertinent and reasonable, and it
justifiably branded an earlier pub
lication of the Dailv as "facetious."
The editorial by the student edi
tor, which was in criticism of
Iloover's statement, possessed ear
marks of soreheadedness. It sounded
like the answer of a spoiled child
who has been rebuked. Crawford
insinuated that because Hoover was
an engineer, he was not an expert
in the field of law enforcement. At
the same time Crawford feels that
because he happens to he an ama
teur journalist that he should be
publicly regarded as the last au
thority on the regulation of traffic.
The subject of law enforcement is
neither connected with engineering
or journalism. It has to do with the
welfare of the people, thus making
it, in reality, the job of each citizen.
Mr. Hoover's article was written
from the standpoint of a citizen. It
was written to point out the lament
able condition of affairs in regard
to traffic dangers which now exist.
The purport of the whole article was
sensible and legitimate. .Unfortu
nately it appeared under an atro
cious headline, which looked like
the work of an irate journalist.

As for (lie student editor who con
siders himself a journalist—al
though his editorial was a much
poorer journalistic contribution than
that of the engineer—it might he
suggested that he confine his re
marks to a decent degree of re
spectfulness for a man of consider
ably more experience and under
standing of life.
