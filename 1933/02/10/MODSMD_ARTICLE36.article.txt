# TO BE REGRETTED
## 
### 
The Editor Sir:
It is to be regretted that the Dean
of the Engineering School docs not
recognize the existence of the "Ma
chine Age." Such an attitude is dis
tinctly reminiscent of a medieval
line of thought.
No one could fail to have sym
pathy and regret for the sudden
passing of a popular member of the
faculty. It i.s a very unfortunate situ
ation. But on the other hand, to be
so cruel as to publish a biased; un
i factual article condemning a girl
who, though innocent of all wrong
intent, i.s undoubtedly suffering tor
ment, is to my mind decidedly un
just and unfair.
I Our worthy Dean condemns the
press for not making a spectacular
I issue of the accident. Such a policy
would indeed be worthy of the
cheapest tabloid and the Daily is to
be congratulated for its sympathetic
outlook. The press i.s spectacular
enough.
The faculty is not and has not
been a selected target for campus
motorists. But any member of it that
revels in making unkind, unjust,
and unfactual public statements is
surely going out of his way to make
himself the target for much right
eous criticism.
