# TO BE REGRETTED

### 
The Editor Sir:
It is to be regretted that the Dean
of the Engineering School docs not
recognize the existence of the "Ma
chine Age." Such an attitude is dis
tinctly reminiscent of a medieval
line of thought.
No one could fail to have sym
pathy and regret for the sudden
passing of a popular member of the
faculty. It i.s a very unfortunate situ
ation. But on the other hand, to be
so cruel as to publish a biased; un
i factual article condemning a girl
who, though innocent of all wrong
intent, i.s undoubtedly suffering tor
ment, is to my mind decidedly un
just and unfair.
I Our worthy Dean condemns the
press for not making a spectacular
I issue of the accident. Such a policy
would indeed be worthy of the
cheapest tabloid and the Daily is to
be congratulated for its sympathetic
outlook. The press i.s spectacular
enough.
