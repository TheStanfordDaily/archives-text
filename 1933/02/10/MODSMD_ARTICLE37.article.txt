# Mission Rookies Invade Sunken Diamond Tomorrow
## THRICE DEFEATED VARSITY BATMEN GAIN EXPERIENCE Game Will Be Last Before Opening Of Conference With Santa Clara 
### 
With three pro-conference funics
on the red side of the ledger, and a
world of experience to balance the
budget, Stanford' varsity nine takes
<iti ihe Mission Rookies at 2:30
o'clock tomorrow on the Sunken
Diamond, befit on winning the last
practice battle before the opening
contest with Santa Clara here next
Wednesday.
Coach WoJter has elected to start
bis up-and-coming southpaw chuck -
or, Lelly Campbell, who looked so
well against the Athens Club a week
ago. "Sunny Jim" Massey will be
behind the plate.
Second Undecided
First base, a toss-up between Art
Hcarri and Gordy Mallatratt, will
be held down by the latter, at least
lor the first four or live innings.
Welter is undecided about his
second-basemen, and intends to
start Jim Woolley again, with Bill
Triplet! and Chuck Clancy in re
serve.
Third base will be occupied by
Jerry Trautman as usual, and the
veteran Bert Delmas, who gathered
in a pair of triples against the
Ketjealy Seals Wednesday, will be
in the short patch.
Outfielders Picked
Outfielders Irslold, Maggiora, and
Miles get the starting call, but there
is a good chance that Buller, Nut
ting, and Walline will see action be
fore' many innings. Wolter is still in
t< rested in finding three fielders to
back up this opening trio, and this
will be his last chance to experi
ment before sending his men after
the league championship, which
they dropped to Southern California
last year.
Wolter may leave Campbell in for
more than the three innings which
most of the pitchers have rated so
far, to give the youngster a little
more experience, but Savinske and |
Howe will probably hurl the closing !
frames.
Like all the other practice games,
the contest will bo free of charge,
and fans can begin to get a pretty
lair line on Stanford's chances in
the coming pennant chase.
