# CARD WATER POLO TEAM FACES BEAR SEPTET TOMORROW
## 
### 
Unless Stanford suffers a com- i
plete reversal of form, or California j
.shows unexpected strength, the In- !
dian varsity water polo team should J
have little difficulty making it 19
straight victories against the Bears J
tomorrow afternoon at Encina pools. ,
Few teams in the history of the
school have shown as much power |
in their early season games as Coach j
Non Thornton's present septet. With j
all three forwards and the two
breaking guards as scoring threats, j
the Indians have completely bewil- j
dered their opponents in previous
contests.
Defense Good
The team's defense has also been j
remarkable. Although it has weak- j
ened momentarily at times the fact
that such strong teams as the Olym- |
pic Club and Athens Club were held j
to five and two goals respectively,!
indicates that the guarding has been j
excellent.
Captain Fred Kothe and Jim Mc-
Kay were outstanding for California j
;;gainst the two club teams and will ;
undoubtedly bo the Bears biggest,
threats against Stanford.
New System
Ylad Taranik, Gordy Graves,
breaking guards, and Ted Wiget, j
Jimmy Benet, and Jimmy Triolo at
forward will carry the brunt of the J
Indian attack. Under the new sys- J
tem of attack adopted this year, all j
% _, j
five are potential threats. Don Kin
kead at centerback and Captain J
Burke Knapp at goal will complete j
the starting lineup. Dick Hirsch, for
ward, and Leo Cook, goal guard, |
will undoubtedly be used sometime j
during the game.
The varsity contest starts at 3:30 |
o'clock. Admission will be 25 cents j
with student body cards, and 40 !
cents for the general public.
A preliminary game between the j
Stanford freshmen and the San |
Francisco Y.M.C.A. will start at 2:30 j
o'clock.
