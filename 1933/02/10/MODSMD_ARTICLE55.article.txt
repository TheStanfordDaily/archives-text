# FROSH NINE MEETS ALAMEDA HIGH FOR SATURDAY FRACAS
## 
### 
With one victory in as many
starts and raring to go once more,
Stanford's freshman baseball team
meets Alameda High tomorrow
morning in what should prove to be
i a real thriller. The contest will take
place at 10 o'clock on the yearling
ball diamond and is open to the
public.
Coach Cuddeback's boys will be
up against some very tough compe
tition tomorrow and will need
everything they have in order to eke
' out u victory. Alameda High School
has long been noted for the caliber
i of its horsehide nines and this year's
! team should not prove any excep
! tion.
Franchesci to Start
Starting on the mound for the
frosh will be Franchesci, southpaw
twirler, who will probably give way
to Blanchard before the contest is
i over. Beth of these boys are good
and Cuddeback is anxious to give
each a chance to show his stuff.
Oct Morgan will open the contest
as catcher, but may be relieved by
Marshall.
An infield composed of Grayson,
first; Galbraith, second; Clark,short;
and Tremaine, third, will see action
at the beginning of the game, while
the outfield will be made up of
Fope, Moscrip, and Hamilton. Mac
rath also should get into the battle
in some capacity.
Grayson, Moscrip Good
Last week against San Mateo
High, Grayson and Moscrip did
some fancy hitting and are expected
to continue the good work tomor
row. Clark and Galbraith also con
tributed bingles and should develop
I into potent willow-wielders.
According to Coach Cuddeback
the most encouraging things about
last Saturday's contest were the per
formances of the outfield and in
field. Only one error was chalked up
i by Manager Hoagland and several
fielding gems were contributed, in
cluding a double play by the infield.
