# Two Nabbed In Plot On Lindy Babe
## 
### 
ROANOKE, Va., Feb. 9 (/P)-Two
youths were arrested here today and
charged with attempting to extort
$50,000 from Colonel Charles A.
Lindbergh, threatening kidnaping of
his second son as the alternative to
payment.
Joe Bryant, 19, and Norman Har
vey, 26, both residents of Roanoke,
were taken into custody shortly
after they attempted to cash a
$17,000 check which police opera
tives, masking as representatives of
the famous flyer, had planted in a
stump.
Chief Johnson, using the name of
''John J. Jones," carried on corre
spondence with the writers of the
extortion notes and arranged to de
posit extortion money in the stump.
They reached an agreement to re
duce the amount to $25,000 and still
later to $17,000. No deposit, how
ever, was made.

For 144 hours one or the other of
two Roanoke officers watched the
stump to catch the extortionists, but
without success. They stopped
watching and deposited more let
ters, which disappeared. The final
arrangements were to leave a check
for $17,000 and let the extortionist
take it to the bank and have it
cashed.
Today Bryant walked into the
bank with the check. The teller, W.
M. Skelton, warned by police,
stepped back to the vault and tele
phoned police.
Chief Johnson and Special Of
ficer Howard Ferguson followed
Bryant from the bank. A block
away he was joined by Harvey.
When Harvey saw Johnson he be
gan to run. The two went in dif
ferent directions, but were soon
captured, Harvey as he sought to
get into a car occupied by his wife,
Ethel, and a small child.
