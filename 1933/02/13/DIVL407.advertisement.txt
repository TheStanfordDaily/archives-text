WHAT?
'
LAW?
Former Federal Judge Edwin L.
Garvin says: "A keen mind, sound
judgment and unflagging industry
are required to digest the volumes
of laws and decisions facing the
practitioner today. The young law
yer can no longer practice by ear
and intuition. The science of the
law is exacting and difficult."
ONLY "a keen mind" can absorb
the volumes of information
.vhich must be at the finger tips of the
/oung lawyer today. Perhaps that's
j why in this profession, as in our lead
ing colleges, a pipe is the favorite
I ;moke. You see, it helps a man con
-1 rentrate . . . clears cobwebs from
I his brain.
Try a pipeful of Edgeworth Smok
ng Tobacco — the favorite smoke
imong college men. ""Notice how that
:>lend of fine old hurleys really helps
'ou think out a difficult problem.
Edgeworth is distinctive . . . that's
vhy you'll like it. You'll know —
tfter your first puff. Want to try it
before you buy? Just write to Larus
ii Bro. Co., 105 S. 22d St., Rich
nond, Virginia.
