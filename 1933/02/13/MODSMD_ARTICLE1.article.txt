With the recommendation of Jim
Lawson, Stanford's first recognized
all-American football pkiyer, for the
end coaching job, the new setup of
varsity football mentors is complete,
and the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control now faces only the problem
of choosing the freshman staff.
Lawson, who was picked at Fri
day evening's meeting of the 8.A.C.,
captained the 1924 team. He lives in
Palo Alto, where he is in business
with his brother.

Teams With Nevers

With the new end coach is a for
mer teammate, Ernie Nevers, who
captained the 1925 Stanford eleven,
made the all-American team as full
back, and established such a reputa
tion that Coach "Pop" Warner
named him as the "greatest football
player I have ever coached." Both
men will work under C. E. "Tiny"
Thornhill, newly recommended
head coach, who also played under
Warner when the Old Fox was at
Pittsburgh University. Thornhill was
also an all-American at tackle, so
Stanford has no complaints on
grounds of poor coaching calibre. .
All three appointments are still
subject to the approval of the Uni
versity's board of trusteesâ€”a matter
expected to be merely a formality.
Lower Dues
Most other business scheduled to
come up at the meeting was laid
over, although action was taken on
reducing the membership fees at the
Stanford golf course. The new prices
are $125 for a year's playing privi
lege, $25 under the old figure; $1
instead of $1.50 green fees during
the middle of the week, and $2 in
stead of $2.50 for green fees on
week-end days.
In addition, the board voted to
offer short-term membership privi
leges of $15 for one month and $40
for three months.
