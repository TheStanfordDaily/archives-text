## 
### 
Twelve original cover designs
from the brush of F. Mcintosh,
famed commercial artist, are now
hung in the Art Department, Room
314.
Mcintosh has been doing covers
for a nationally known travel maga
zine for 10 years and, in addition to
this, is at present teaching in a Los
Angeles art school. The pictures,
dealing with oriental subjects, are
brilliantly colored and produced
with meticulous striving for detail.
