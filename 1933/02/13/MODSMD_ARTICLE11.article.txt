# Cross, Crescent Allee Samee To Rum-Dum Allah
## 
### 
"For Allah and for beauty,"
humbly intoned a Moorish slave
as lie carefully made the sign
of the cross for one of the
many maidens who lolled in
restful 'tween-dance comfort
on the great Moorish lounge
at Friday's Toyon Forma).
The Christianity-appreciating
Moor, his bashful reticence
finally overcome by two pals
who forced him bodily from his
private upstairs sanctorum to
the decorated Ipbby, spent the
evening passing out cigarettes
with the coy, subtle grace of a
Stanford roughâ€”in costume.
Another costumed Toyonite
who also caught the pleased
crowd's eye was the liat
checker who bravely glided
among 'the dancing couples,
made handsomer than ever by
the towel turban that encircled
his swaying head.
