# STUDENTS VOTE TOMORROW ON 3 AMENDMENTS
## Preferential Voting Among Possible Changes In Constitution 
### 
Voting on changes in class officer
ships, in athletic awards, and in the
choosing of all student body officers
other than Men's Council and cer
tain similar positions, Stanford stu
dents will be asked to express their
opinions concerning amendments to
three articles in the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution at tomorrow's election.
The abolition of the vice-presi
dency of the three lower classes and
the combination of the offices of
secretary and treasurer into one
position, will be considered, as will
the filling of vacancies in all class
offices by the president of the
A.S.S.U. with the approval of the
Ex Committee.
Class Officers
The third reform concerning class
officers states that with the excep
tion of freshmen, and the senior
treasurer, the officers chosen in May
shall serve from the beginning of
summer quarter until the following
February, and those chosen in Feb
ruary from then until the following
summer quarter.
The changes in athletic awards in
clude the giving of a Circle Block
"S" to only those soccer players
who participate in one-half of a
game with California or its equiva
lent in two games, instead of giving
the award to anyone participating
in two California games for any
length of time. Also, the basis of
freshman awards will be made (if
the amendment is ratified) similar
to all varsity awards.
Preferential Voting
The most important change con
cerns the substitution of a preferen
tial system of voting for the present
direct method. Under this new plan,
voters will mark their first, second,
and third choices for all offices
other than those in Men's Council
and other bodies where two or more
vacancies are to be filled.
If no candidate receives the requi
site majority, the second choices
marked on the ballots of the candi
dates receiving the fewest first
choices are counted. This system has
been suggested to prevent the nu
merous revotes necessary on the
campus, and to present a fairer pic
ture of the voters' choices. Follow
ing are the amendments as proposed
by the election board and as they
will appear on tomorrow's ballots:
Article VI
That Article VI, Class Officers, be
amended to read as follows:
Section 2—Number:
"There shall be a president and a
secretary-treasurer of the freshman,
sophomore, and junior classes. The
senior class shall have a president,
a vice-president, a secretary, and a
treasurer."
Section 2—Vacancies:
"In case there is a vacancy in a
class office the vacancy shall be
filled by the president of the asso
ciation with the approval of the
Executive Committee, such officers
to serve until the following elec
tion."
Section 15—Election:
"The first freshman class officers
shall be chosen at the regular No
vember election to serve until the
following February. All other class
officers shall be chosen at the regu
lar Association elections in May and
February, and the officers chosen in
May shall serve from the beginning
