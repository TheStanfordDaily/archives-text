# STUDENTS VOTE TOMORROW ON 3 AMENDMENTS
## Preferential Voting Among Possible Changes In Constitution 
### 
Voting on changes in class officer
ships, in athletic awards, and in the
choosing of all student body officers
other than Men's Council and cer
tain similar positions, Stanford stu
dents will be asked to express their
opinions concerning amendments to
three articles in the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution at tomorrow's election.
The abolition of the vice-presi
dency of the three lower classes and
the combination of the offices of
secretary and treasurer into one
position, will be considered, as will
the filling of vacancies in all class
offices by the president of the
A.S.S.U. with the approval of the
Ex Committee.
Class Officers
The third reform concerning class
officers states that with the excep
tion of freshmen, and the senior
treasurer, the officers chosen in May
shall serve from the beginning of
summer quarter until the following
February, and those chosen in Feb
ruary from then until the following
summer quarter.
The changes in athletic awards in
clude the giving of a Circle Block
"S" to only those soccer players
who participate in one-half of a
game with California or its equiva
lent in two games, instead of giving
the award to anyone participating
in two California games for any
length of time. Also, the basis of
freshman awards will be made (if
the amendment is ratified) similar
to all varsity awards.
Preferential Voting
The most important change con
cerns the substitution of a preferen
tial system of voting for the present
direct method. Under this new plan,
voters will mark their first, second,
and third choices for all offices
other than those in Men's Council
and other bodies where two or more
vacancies are to be filled.
If no candidate receives the requi
site majority, the second choices
marked on the ballots of the candi
dates receiving the fewest first
choices are counted. This system has
been suggested to prevent the nu
merous revotes necessary on the
campus, and to present a fairer pic
ture of the voters' choices. Follow
ing are the amendments as proposed
by the election board and as they
will appear on tomorrow's ballots:

The changes in athletic awards in
clude the giving of a Circle Block
"S" to only those soccer players
who participate in one-half of a
game with California or its equiva
lent in two games, instead of giving
the award to anyone participating
in two California games for any
length of time. Also, the basis of
freshman awards will be made (if
the amendment is ratified) similar
to all varsity awards.
Preferential Voting
The most important change con
cerns the substitution of a preferen
tial system of voting for the present
direct method. Under this new plan,
voters will mark their first, second,
and third choices for all offices
other than those in Men's Council
and other bodies where two or more
vacancies are to be filled.
If no candidate receives the requi
site majority, the second choices
marked on the ballots of the candi
dates receiving the fewest first
choices are counted. This system has
been suggested to prevent the nu
merous revotes necessary on the
campus, and to present a fairer pic
ture of the voters' choices. Follow
ing are the amendments as proposed
by the election board and as they
will appear on tomorrow's ballots:

been suggested to prevent the nu
merous revotes necessary on the
campus, and to present a fairer pic
ture of the voters' choices. Follow
ing are the amendments as proposed
by the election board and as they
will appear on tomorrow's ballots:
Article VI
That Article VI, Class Officers, be

ciation with the approval of the

to serve until the following elec
tion."
Section 15—Election:
"The first freshman class officers
shall be chosen at the regular No
vember election to serve until the
following February. All other class
officers shall be chosen at the regu
lar Association elections in May and
February, and the officers chosen in
May shall serve from the beginning
of summer quarter until the follow
ing February and those chosen in
February shall serve until the fol
lowing summer quarter; except that
the treasurer uf the senior class,
chosen in May, shall serve one
year."
Article VIII
That Article VIII, Athletics, be
amended to read as follows:
Section 3—Minor Sport Awards,
Part B:
"Any man who competes against
California one-half of the playing
time of one soccer game, or the
equivalent playing time in two soc
cer games, shall be awarded a Circle
Block 'S.'"
Section 7—Freshman Sports:
"Freshman sports shall be the

- same as varsity sports. Freshman
i awards shall be made only in refer
- ence to competition with California
t and the requirement for these
, awards shall be the same as for tne
: varsity, except in football. Any man
who plays one-half hour of the
Southern California football same,
or in ten minutes of the California
" game, or has an average of fifteen
minutes per conference game, shall
, be entitled to an award. Freshman
awards for major sports shall be a
t block numeral and for minor sports
, a circle block numeral."
), Article IX
That Article IX, Elections, be
? amended to read as follows:
Section s—Majority for Election:
"To elect any officer a majority
of all the ballots counted is neces
sary. The ballots are distributed ac
cording to first choice votes. If no
one candidate receives the requisite
majority of first choices, the ballots
ol that candidate who has received
the lowest number are redistributed
according to the second choice in
dicated thereon, and another count
for the majority is made. The re
distribution. and recounting are con
tinued until one candidate is
elected." (Third choices are counted
only when first and second choices
on the ballot have been exhausted:
ballots are temporarily laid aside
when third choices have been ex
hausted.)
The above system does not apply
to the Men's Council and other
bodies where there are two or more
vacancies to be filled. In such cases
those candidates receiving the high
est number of votes shall be de
clared elected.
Voting on changes in class officer
ships, in athletic awards, and in the
choosing of all student body officers
other than Men's Council and cer
tain similar positions, Stanford stu
dents will be asked to express their
opinions concerning amendments to
three articles in the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution at tomorrow's election.
The abolition of the vice-presi
dency of the three lower classes and
the combination of the offices of
secretary and treasurer into one
position, will be considered, as will
the filling of vacancies in all class
offices by the president of the
A.S.S.U. with the approval of the
Ex Committee.
Class Officers
The third reform concerning class
officers states that with the excep
tion of freshmen, and the senior
treasurer, the officers chosen in May
shall serve from the beginning of
summer quarter until the following
February, and those chosen in Feb
ruary from then until the following
summer quarter.
The changes in athletic awards in
clude the giving of a Circle Block
"S" to only those soccer players
who participate in one-half of a
game with California or its equiva
lent in two games, instead of giving
the award to anyone participating
in two California games for any
length of time. Also, the basis of
freshman awards will be made (if
the amendment is ratified) similar
to all varsity awards.
Preferential Voting
The most important change con
cerns the substitution of a preferen
tial system of voting for the present
direct method. Under this new plan,
voters will mark their first, second,
and third choices for all offices
other than those in Men's Council
and other bodies where two or more
vacancies are to be filled.
If no candidate receives the requi
site majority, the second choices
marked on the ballots of the candi
dates receiving the fewest first
choices are counted. This system has
been suggested to prevent the nu
merous revotes necessary on the
campus, and to present a fairer pic
ture of the voters' choices. Follow
ing are the amendments as proposed
by the election board and as they
will appear on tomorrow's ballots:
