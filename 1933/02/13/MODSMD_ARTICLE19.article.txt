# Lagunita Nears Maximum Level
## 
### 
Within three or four days Lagu
nita will reach its maximum level
in spite of the loss of water caused
on account of last week's dry spell,
it was announced at the Boathouse
last night by Fred Tebbetts, man
ager.
The lake remains approximately
two feet from the top with about a
four-inch gain over the high mark
early last week. Because of the late
ness of Lagunita's tilling this year,
about five weeks, it should last well
into spring quarter, according to
Tebbetts.
The lake is now receiving the
overflow from Searsville and a nor
mal run-off will soon fill it. A
cloudburst would do little good be
cause of the smallness of the supply
flume.
Tebbetts said that canoeing has
been heavier, to date, than was ex
pected. Several improvements have
been made, especially on the rafts,
which now are equipped with a life
preserver and a red lantern.
Each owner of a canoe must pur
chase a life preserver. These are a
special 19-inch type, costing $3,
small enough not to be in the way
in the canoe. The Boathouse has
about two dozen 011 hand.
