The Reverend Lynn White, D.D.,
of San Anselmo, spoke yesterday
morning at the services in the Me
morial Church and discussed the
question of happiness, attempting to
show that it is God's will that hu
manity enjoy itself.
Dr. White said that God is in life
and that it is futile to search for
Him elsewhere, although when He
has been understood in His fullest,
life has a new meaning and attrac

to act naturally without too many
restrictions. This is possible, he
maintained, by following the Scrip
ture.
