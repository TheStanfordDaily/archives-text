### Dick Strouse 
With two hard-fought. losses
; against Southern California to their
1 discredit, Stanford University's bas
j kctball team will meet, a victoryless
| five from Meiji University at <S
I o'clock tonight in the Pavilion to
j determine the nadir of Occidental
and Oriental basketball.
The Japanese' team, that has been
| playing bay region squads and thai
| has yet to win a game, .sat in tin
press box on Saturday night and
j watched Stanford scare the Trojans
; by building up a halftime lead, but
j fit.ally lose 28 to 36. On Friday,
! there wasn't even a scare, as the
! Indians bowed 18 to 34 to the bril
; fiance ol Julius Bescos, Jerry Ncmer,
I and Lee Guttero.
Small Crowds Sec Tilts
Throughout the series, John Han
cock and Keith Topping did their
j best to help entertain two small
I crowds that much preferred to
; I tugh at Sam Barry and to jeer at
i Joe Kelly than to cheer the Stanford
five. Barry, in fact, deserves special
I credit for traveling all the way from
! Los Angeles to amuse the Stanford
rooters in general and the women
; who sat behind him and listened to
| his mutterings about Referee John
j son, in particular.
The first game found Stanford
trailing (i to 16 at halftime, and then
! coming up to 13 to 19 before the
Trojan power asserted itself. Gut-
I tero and Nemer made 17 of the S.C.
points, and Bescos, who smiles when
he tramples on® Stanford men and
then laughingly picks them up from
i ihe floor, held Topping to 5 points,
which is an accomplishment to
! boast of.
Few Field Goals
Stanford was breaking slowly Fri-
I day night and Tom Cordry, although
j always trying, was unable to score
' more than once from the field. Han
j cock, ihe least appreciated of Stan
' ford players, was pulling high passes
cut of nowhere, was giving Nemer a
j real workout, and also found time
I to score three field goals.
Disgusted and dissatisfied, Coach
1 Bunn started . Weaver, Topping,
J Edelen, Hancock, and Schnetka on
Saturday, and this five rolled up 20
points at halftime to 18 for the
j Trojans. Eight of the twenty were
I made by Bill Schnetka during his
I brilliant fifteen minutes on the floor
I ;.nd six more were made by the in

; by building up a halftime lead, but

Small Crowds Sec Tilts
Throughout the series, John Han
cock and Keith Topping did their
j best to help entertain two small
I crowds that much preferred to
; I tugh at Sam Barry and to jeer at
i Joe Kelly than to cheer the Stanford
five. Barry, in fact, deserves special
I credit for traveling all the way from
! Los Angeles to amuse the Stanford
rooters in general and the women
; who sat behind him and listened to
| his mutterings about Referee John
j son, in particular.
The first game found Stanford
trailing (i to 16 at halftime, and then
! coming up to 13 to 19 before the
Trojan power asserted itself. Gut-
I tero and Nemer made 17 of the S.C.
points, and Bescos, who smiles when
he tramples on® Stanford men and
then laughingly picks them up from
i ihe floor, held Topping to 5 points,
which is an accomplishment to
! boast of.
Few Field Goals
Stanford was breaking slowly Fri-
I day night and Tom Cordry, although
j always trying, was unable to score
' more than once from the field. Han
j cock, ihe least appreciated of Stan
' ford players, was pulling high passes
cut of nowhere, was giving Nemer a
j real workout, and also found time
I to score three field goals.
Disgusted and dissatisfied, Coach
1 Bunn started . Weaver, Topping,
J Edelen, Hancock, and Schnetka on
Saturday, and this five rolled up 20
points at halftime to 18 for the
j Trojans. Eight of the twenty were
I made by Bill Schnetka during his
I brilliant fifteen minutes on the floor
I ;.nd six more were made by the in

j part of Saturday evening picking
himself up from the floor where
