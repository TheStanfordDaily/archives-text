# A 						TROPHY FOP STANFORD ROOTERS
## 
### 
In a wil'd, bitter, bristling battle, (loach Sam Hurry of
I Ik* I Hi vers iI v of Southern California and a few hundred
Stanford roofers met for llie Poor Sportsmanship cliam
|)ionshi|) of (lie world lasl Friday and Saturday nights in
(lie Pavilion, willi the newspaper decision going lo Ihe
roofers.
Stealing the show completely from the Indian and Tro
jan basketball learns, Harrv and Stanford men were each
handicapped by internal dissension that weakened their
respective concentrated attacks on decency. Guard Kelly
was the Trojan who helped make possible Harry's defeat,
and "Gentleman John" Hunn from Kansas, who in his
three years in California has not become sufficiently Stan
fordized lo understand the spirit of intercollegiate foul
play, proved a traitor to the cause of bigger and better boos.
Kelly's unintentional part in the raging little drama was
lo incite the Stanford rooters to unprecedented heights of
discourtesy. Never before have even the well-trained
gentlemen of the upper ten per cent cheered as opponents
missed shots or hissed anti-Stanford decisions with the
strength and finesse they displayed over the week-end.
Harrv almost captured the Poor Sportsmanship trophy
for the already well-stocked Trojan trophy rooms by his
side-line coaching, his nervousness, and his agitation over
the officiating. Wis efforts merely entertained the Stanford
co-eds at his back, for the Cardinal roofers had Ihe edge
of the contest all Ihe way.
Hut John Hunn almost gave Ihe trophy lo the Trojans
Friday night with his fervent appeal lo sportsmanship from
Ihe center of the court. The Indian rooters came back
strong Ihe following evening, however. Gone was the good
humored tolerance I hey exhibited in the earlier r.C.L.A.
series. The Stanford stands were beyond control. They
booed, hissed, jeered and they cinched the title.
