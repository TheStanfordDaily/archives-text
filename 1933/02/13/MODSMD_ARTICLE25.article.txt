The debate, which attracted city wide attention in the
south, was on the question of whether Communism in
Russia is a failure. The Stanford team upheld the nega
tive side and because of its impartial presentation of facts
succeeded in winning over many listeners to their less popu
lar view.
The occasion was remarkable as it marked the (irst
time that a question of this kind had been presented in an
impartial manner before any audience in the United Stales.
The fads that were used were the result of $200,000 worth
of research into communism, as practiced in Russia.
It is encouraging to think that this question was brought
up for the first time by the joint action of two American
universities. A social movement of such interest to the
world can be more fairly judged if fanaticism and bad
feeling do not enter into the discussion. There is no place
better suited to debate so vital a problem than in the halls
of a university where, more than any other spot, the "winds
of freedom should blow."
