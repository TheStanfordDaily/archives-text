# BULL SESSION
## SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 
### 
Exceeding everything but the sex
drive in ultimate potency, is Ihe de
sire of everyone to get something
foi nothing. And with some people,
1 wouldn't be a bit surprised to find
the "Something for Nothing" drive
first. It is irresistible; can be dis
proved in theory; but never over
come in actual fact.
Thoy measure the power of ihe
sex-drive by making rats run
through miles of dark mazes to find
their loved-ones. And how those
rats run. It is a bit more difficult to
tabulate the exact force of the
"Something for Nothing" drive—but
psychology could no doubt find a
way.
There is something fascinating in
getting anything without paying its
full value. So fascinating* is the sen
sation that long after "gold-bricks"
were a joke in New York, they were
selling them in lowa. And the ex
ternal form of the brick was changed
and gold mine stocks were sold.
Later, oil stock. It was always the
si'.me story—something for almost
nothing.
Stanford has her examples. I have ,
seen men go to a smoker—and
scramble like starved pigeons for a
five-cent cigar—just because it was
free. That is perfectly all right—it
must be, for I probably was one of !
the most voracious scramblers of
them all. But, what is pitiful, is to

see them try to smoke the things—
not out of enjoyment—but because
of the "Something for Nothing"
drive.
A cigar is a thing of value—in the
broad sense of the term. They have
the cigar. It cost nothing. It must
be utilized. Of course, acute nausea
usually overcomes the ctyive in
question about one inch from the
business-end. Then, the cigar is de
posited in an ash tray.
Everyone has heard of the big,
bold men boasting of their great ex
ploits in the "Blue Books"—without
"cracking a book." "Smacked the
ex cold, and never looked at the
text"—is a boast so old it has be
come a symbol. The person giving
vent to such a boast, as well as the
person who hears it, knows it to be
a plain prevarication.
But that doesn't matter. It is
merely the "Something for Nothing"
drive in scholastic dress. Most mor
tals have to read the material to
prevent flunking. This hero (blessed
by the gods) has swept on to vic
-1 tory without the customary effort.
. Something for nothing again.
Of course, there are always "read
ers" so baffled by words, they can't
read facts, on examination papers.
' But it is a feeble boast, indeed, to
put something over these unfor
tunates. —Abe Mellinkoff

A cigar is a thing of value—in the
broad sense of the term. They have
the cigar. It cost nothing. It must
be utilized. Of course, acute nausea
usually overcomes the ctyive in
question about one inch from the
business-end. Then, the cigar is de

Everyone has heard of the big,
bold men boasting of their great ex
ploits in the "Blue Books"—without
"cracking a book." "Smacked the
ex cold, and never looked at the
text"—is a boast so old it has be
come a symbol. The person giving
vent to such a boast, as well as the
person who hears it, knows it to be
a plain prevarication.
But that doesn't matter. It is
merely the "Something for Nothing"
drive in scholastic dress. Most mor

Exceeding everything but the sex
drive in ultimate potency, is Ihe de
sire of everyone to get something

Thoy measure the power of ihe
sex-drive by making rats run

rats run. It is a bit more difficult to
tabulate the exact force of the
"Something for Nothing" drive—but
psychology could no doubt find a
way.
There is something fascinating in
getting anything without paying its
full value. So fascinating* is the sen
sation that long after "gold-bricks"
were a joke in New York, they were
selling them in lowa. And the ex
ternal form of the brick was changed
and gold mine stocks were sold.
Later, oil stock. It was always the
si'.me story—something for almost
nothing.
Stanford has her examples. I have ,
seen men go to a smoker—and
scramble like starved pigeons for a
five-cent cigar—just because it was
free. That is perfectly all right—it
must be, for I probably was one of !

them all. But, what is pitiful, is to

see them try to smoke the things—
