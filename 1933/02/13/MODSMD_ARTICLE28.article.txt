The Editor, Sir:
To Allen W. Beach, Education
Graduate—an open letter:
After your tempestuous defense of
Dean Hoover's attack on the "killer
drivers" who are said to be running
rampant on this campus, it appears
to me that you are a classic example
of the very faults with which you
charged Editor Crawford.
Crawford, you say, is a sorehead.
When you flayed Crawford's "ama
teur journalism," his "atrocious
headline," and his lack of decency,
you were, we assume, Mr. Beach,
the very epitome of cool-headed
ness.
Quite typically, you say that
Crawford, being a journalist, is no
authority on law enforcement. Yet

when you charged that
j editorial was a "poorer contribution
to journalism than Dean Hoover's,"
you were, doubtless, utilizing what
I they taught you in the School of
Education.
I am not certain of the methods
! used in the education department,
Mr. Beach, but in the econ. division
| even we sophomores are taught to
, get at least a smattering of facts
; before sticking out the beagle, so to
speak.
In spite of "upstart" Crawford's
amateur journalism, he dug up the
police report of the accident. This,
Theodore Hoover—Engineer — and
ycu, Mr. Beach—Education Grad—
failed to do.
I Crawford was certainly acting like

! a "spoiled child," now wasn't he?
Hoover, on the other hand, with his •
mature, "understanding of life," took !
the whole thing quite calmly. Mere- \
■ ly a few quiet references to "campus [
killers," "insane law violation," and
Dr. Swain and the Padre (among
, others) as "excellent targets in a
continuous program of exuberant
manslaughter."
Yours for fairness,
