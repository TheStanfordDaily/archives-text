LETTER WRITERS OF TIIE ISTII
CENTURY: lll—Frances Burney.
The letters of "little Burney - ' are
decidedly literary efforts, or, to pin
it more plainly, are somewhat pomp
ous. They lack the peculiar, personal
touch that goes into most intimate
correspondence and create the
strange impression that the writer
was regarding herself as a third
party, very much as if she were
thinking of the action of one of the
characters in her stories. But it is
only on this ground that one can
find the will to pardon her for the
conceit over her novel Evalina. A
certain amount of satisfaction in the
accomplishment would have been
excusable, but the constant atten
tion paid to what everyone had to
say concerning the work, combined
with an hypocritical attitude of reti
cence, is annoying.
However, it is not for her pomp
osity or egotism that Fanny Burney
is particularly to be admired or
read. It is for the supplement to
Boswell's picture of Johnson. Bos
well portrays Johnson with more at

tention to shadow than to highlight;
consequently, the result, though an
amazingly exact image, is too heav
ily tinged with one side of Johnson's
character. Miss Burney, on the other
hand, represents the sage from an
other viewpoint. Her letters show
him in his social life as he appeared
to his contemporaries rather than as
the intimate creation of Boswell.
They bhow him twitting Lady Ladd
on her ostentation:
With patchts, paint, and jewels on,
Sure, Phillis is not twenty-one;
Bui when ;it night you Phillis see,
The dame at least is forty-three.
This may be paralleled from Bos
well's Lile; indeed, it would be hard
to find an example which it does
not parallel; but Boswell's Johnson
has always the air of a Jovian cen
sor hurling thunderbolts at mortals
all too human in their frailties. Miss
Burney, it is true, makes Johnson
a little more than human but man
ages at the same time to instil a
portion of dry good humour which
Boswell missed entirely. For this,
"little Burney's" constant prating of
Evalina may easily be forgiven.
