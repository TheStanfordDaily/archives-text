# DIGGIN'S

### 
(Statement of Archaeologist
James Henry Breasted, upon
sailing for the Near East.)
"It makes you feel utterly insig
nificant to dig and find that those
people were so concerned over
things that mattered so much to
them. . . . And to come across all
their tweedle-de-dums and tweedle
de-dees. . . . Given time, others
will laugh at your tweedle-de-dees."
Along with prohibition.

When cornered wo generally
Doubt the veracity
Of persons who brag
On their beverage capacity.
