TH E CALIFORNIA AGGIE
STANFORD boxing bouts last
Thursday night brought out a good
crowd, some darn good fighting, and
i-( me mighty queer incidents.
For one thing, we should like to
know why Earl Baumgardner (ac
cording to the program), who in
reality is the Young Harry Greb of
San Francisco and Salinas rings,
was fighting for the Aggies? Once
upon a time Waldo Munday, Stan
ford junior middleweight, took a
decision over him, but we person
ally doubt very much if he expected
to encounter Greb in a collegiate
ring.
Bunny Johnson, who is one of
(he coining lighters on Harry
Maloney's squad, took quite a
neat trimming at the hands o!
Joe Rosenberg, Aggie bantam.
[Sunny frit pretty badly about it
until someone told him that Joe
was the alternate on the 1932
Olympic boxing team.
Oscar Baer furnished the fans
;i good laugh when he flattened his
opponent in about a mi'.ute and a
half, and then sat down in the stands
10 watch the next bout, without
bothering to do more than remove
his gloves.
Jim Feeley ran up against a real
fighter in this boy Ronald Painter.
Ftelcy pasted him all over Ihe ring,
but Painter wouldn't say " 'nuff." In
11 ct, the Aggie came back in the
third, and although hopelessly far
behind, was still throwing his
punches straight when the bout
ended.
The "natural" of the evening
was to have the two captains
fighting it out in the last bout,
for the team title. Captain
Glover, Stanford, gained a well
earned decision over Captain
Jewett, but he took plenty of
punishment in doing it.
It was a nice card, with only two
or three bouts sewed up from the
start. The new 11-bout-card was a
fifie idea. It gives more boys a
chance to show, and the crowd a lot
more for its money,
STANFORD PLAYED PRET
TY FAIR basketball lor the first
half Saturday night, but the
Trojans had too much left. Barry
substitutes when his men show
signs of fatigue. Coach Bunn has
no alternative but to substitute |
only when his men are obviously ;
off form, or arc sent out on fouls.
THE INDIANS took their first
water polo game from California by
a comfortable margin. What we are
wondering is: who so few substi
tutes? New policy, perhaps?
