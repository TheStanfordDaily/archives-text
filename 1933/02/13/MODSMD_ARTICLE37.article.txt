# Freshman Hoopmen Add Pair To Victory String
## FRESNO HI, MENLO BOW TO STANFORD FIVE, 33-11, 36-29 Bradshaw's Men Hold High School Scoreless In First Period 
### Albert Guerard 
Making up in small measure for
the varsity's double disaster, Stan
ford's freshman basketball team
heaped more laurels on its already
heavily laden brow with impressive
week-end victories over Menlo Jun
ior College, 36-29, and Fresno High,
33-11.
Stanford started fast in the Menlo
games, and led 23-11 at half time.
The Jaysee five then proceeded to
score fourteen points while the In
dians (mostly reserve players) were
completing two free throws. From
this point, 25-25, George Viguie en
gineered a Stanford rally which
stretched the score to 27-25, and
filially 3(5-29 in favor of the Indians.
Scoreless Wonders
Fresno's quintet was very disap
pointing on Saturday night. The
prep team's reputation in Valley
basketball circles was of no avail
during the first half. Fresno, all
seven, left the court for their inter
mission rest with lowered eyes and
blushing cheeks, having failed to
score a single point. A big factor in
Fresno's failure was a negro for
ward, Gene Hinds, whose tactics in
advancing the ball invoked numer
ous "walking" penalties from the
officials.
With Captain Addie Barnett lead
ing Ihe way, Stanford ran up an 11-0
lead during the first five minytes of
play. During the remaining fourteen
minutes of the first half George
Viguie's set-up shot was the only
field goal, although Viguie and
Greenlee each made one free throw.
The Indians were too busy preserv
ing that perfect defensive record, to
bother about making any points on
their own behalf.
George Viguie opened the second
half with a miracle side shot which
stretched the count to 17-0, but just
when everything looked rosy for a
"Believe-it-or-not" victory, Fresno's
Hinds and Makison dropped in
"prayer" shots in quick succession.
Speedy Ralph Mann ion then got
under way and took no time at all
to make three close-in baskets and
net two free throws. At the end of
(he third quarter Stanford led, 27-7.
The final ten minutes of play
found numerous little-known play
ers in the freshman lineup. They
did some fairly good defensive
work, but were unable to make
their own shots good. Wally Brooke,
Svd Rosenberg, and a complete
newcomer, Ralph Coltrell, did some
very efficient playing in this last
Stanford flurry which increased the
Indian lead to 33-11.
