### 
With Captain Ken Livingston
breaking breast-stroke records as
easily as he splashes water into the
eyes of his competitors, Stanford's
freshman swimming team defeated
San Jose State 43 to 32 last Friday,
and then lost to the San Francisco
Y.M.C.A. on Saturday, 28 to 46.
Livingston, who is among the best
prospects in this event in Stanford
freshman history, swam the 200-
yard breast-stroke in 2:44.8 on Fri
day and then came within three and
three-tenths seconds of Buster
Crabbe's Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate record when he paddled the
distance in 2:43.3 on Saturday. Liv
ingston's best time is something like
four and one-half seconds faster
than the Stanford-California fresh
man record.
The week-end also found De
Myers winning two races, the frosh
taking the backstroke in both meets.
Tom Boothe, who threw himself
through space for two second places
in the diving, also looks promising.
Stanford showed some strength in
the relays, but the yearlings are still
without sufficient free-style talent.
