# Water Poloists Down U.C., 10-0

### 
Badly trouncing California before [
a small crowd which was not fright
ened away by the threatening rain,
Stanford's varsity water polo team
lengthened its lead in the Northern
California League to a full game
Saturday. The Indians have won
three games and lost none.
After the opening minutes of the
contest, there was little doubt as to
the ultimate result. It was merely a
matter of score. The final count was
l'J to 0, Ted Wiget scoring as the
final gun was fired.
Stanford showed a stronger de- j
fense than in any game this year,
Goalies Burke Knapp and Leo Cook
having only about a half-dozen op
portunities for action during the j
afternoon.
Ted Wiget, with three goals, was
high-point man, while Jimmy Benet
and Dick Hirsch, both of whom
played only half the game, scored !
two apiece. Jimmy Triolo, Vlad
Taranik, and Ed McDowell account
ed for the remaining three counters, j
Other Indian players were Gor- I
don Graves, Don Kinkead, and Sid
Mitchell.
Inasmuch as California seldom
had the ball, it is difficult to pick
out any individual player as out
standing on offense. None were very |
effective on defense either.
Stanford meets the Olympic Club, '
which was defeated 8 to 4 here, in :
a return engagement next Friday i
night at the Post Street pool.
