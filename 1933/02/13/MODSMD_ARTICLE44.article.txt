# Soph Hoopsters Bow To Frosh In Fast Game
## 
### 
Outplaying their opponents in
their shooting game, the freshman
women's basketball team Friday
afternoon defeated the sophomore
women 38 to 27. Barbara Stewart
and Helen Fulton played a fast
gt:me as the freshman forwards.
The sophomores showed good form
but their shooting ability was off
par and lost them the game, though
Betty Ballachey, forward, played a
good game, as did the centers, Helen
Ray and Iris Forsythe. The contest
was marked by a great number of
personal fouls; several players on
both sides having to leave the game.
The next interclass tilt is on Tues
day between the sophomores and
the juniors.
