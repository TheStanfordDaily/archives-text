# Women Find Highest Art In Date-Breaking Ability
## 
### ROLPH MALLOCH 
Gelling a man to ask for a date is
one of the things co-eds instinctive
ly know how to do. But tactfully
refusing a date they don't want re
quires practiced art. A local survey
reveals that the latter problem is
scientifically simplified in many
Stanford sororities by the existence
of carefully prepared lists of ex
cuses.
Tiie excuses, tacked by the tele
phone, are numbered for instant
use. Behind each reason on the list
is a generous blank space for the
names of the victims of that par
ticular pica for release, so that the
same man won't be given the same
excuse too often.
Among the popular lines currently
in use are: "I have to take care of
a sick kitten," "Sorry, but I prom
ised to visit my grandmother in
Piedmont," and "My aunt in Oak
land just had twins and 1 have to
think up names for them."
The academic excuses (writing

term paper, studying for exam, etc.)
make a series by themselves. To
ward the end of the lists art; the
facetious answers, such as "I have
to see a man about a dog," and "I
have to see a dog about a man."
Broken legs are old-fashioned.
Having to go to a meeting is one
of the favorite devices used by the
girls in one of the less ingenious
bouses. Meetings may be of any
thing from the Y.M.C.A. to the So
cialist Party.
Of course, in many cases the lists
go unused, but it's wise to be pre
pared for even the remotest pos
sibilities, like the Knight in "Alice
in Wonderland" who kept a mouse
trap on his horse's back, admitting
it wasn't likely there would be any
mice, but if they did come, he didn't
choose to have them running about.
Provided for everything, like the
sororities, he also kept anklets
around the horse's feet to guard
against the bites of sharks.
