## Ball Team Makes Bingles Count In Close Six Inning Game 
### Bob Wade 
Turning eight hits into six runs '
while the Mission Rookies were j
scoring only five with their nine |
blows, Stanford's varsity baseball
team won its first game in four.
starts on the Sunken Diamond Sat- â– 
urday, although the battle was j
called in the sixth inning because j
of rain.
The Rookies scored in the initial j
frame on two singles and an error, j
The second inning was scoreless, I
but the Mission aggregation made
it 2-0 in the first half of the third j
on a trio of base hits. Stanford came |
back in the home half to tally a ;
trio of runs on two walks, hits by |
Maggiora and Delmas, and Catcher j
Dugan's error.
Savinske Triples
The visitors evened the count in j
the next inning on a walk, a sacri- ,
fice bunt, and a single by Pitcher i
Bonnetti.
Stanford again took the lead in the 1
home half when Trautman and Mas
sey singled and Pitcher Savinske
brought them home with a triple to ,
right centerfield, the only extrabase
blow of the game.
The Cards sewed up the battle in ,
the fifth. Mallatratt reached first on
an error; Woolley singled; Irsfeld
advanced them both with a sacri- !
fice; and Trautman drove Mallatratt I
home with his second single of the
day.
Three Pitchers
The Rookies managed to score two j
more in their half of the sixth, on a j
walk and a pair of one-base blows, j
but the game ended there, with the |
Indians in the lead, as Ihe drizzle j
which had been coming down inter- j
mittently turned into a real rain.
Coach Wolter used Campbell, Sa- :
vinske, and Heringer on the mound, j
with Savinske proving the most ef- j
fcctive. He allowed the visitors two ;
hits and a run, in two innings, and !
contributed a hit which drove in ]
two markers to his own ball game, j
Woolley and Trautman carried off 1
the hitting honors for Stanford with
a pair of singles apiece. For the
Rookies, Wright collected three for !
four, and E. Murphy and Mort drove
out two for three. Stanford played
good ball for this time of the sea
son, and Wolter was fairly well
satisfied with the last practice ap- [
pearance before the opening league j
game here Wednesday against Santa i
Clara.
