# CARD RESERVES TAKE EASY WIN FROM MEIJI U.
## Japanese Cagers Put Up Game Fight, Bat Are Far Too small FINAL SCORE IS 41 TO 17 Contest Is Last Game Of Indians' Home Season 
### Bob Letts 
/Coach John Bunn purposely used
yiis reserve basketball players to
give Meiji University of Tokyo,
Japan, a chance to display how the
game is played across the Pacific,
but the Stanford substitutes got
going so well that they held the in
vaders scoreless from the field in
the first half and piled up a 41 to 17
score here last night.
Wit*h Payne Palmer and Palmer j
Fuller hitting the hoop from all
angles, the Cardinals got off to an
early lead and kept stacking up
points with such consistency that (
the two or three hundred fans pres
ent began to wonder what the final
score would Bfe. The half-time mar
gin was 19 to 4.
Meiji Players Game
Despite the disheartening fact that
another beating was staring them in ;
the face, the plucky little Nipponese ,
came back with as much vigor as J
ever, and were soon rewarded when j
Masuda, their clever center, tanked
a shot from directly under the bas- J
ket. A1 Page came back with three
points for the Indians to run the
score up to 30 to 7, and then Masuda |
converted a free throw, only to have j
that offset by another field goal from j
Page.
The Japanese quintet's longest !
sustained scoring—a four-point run j
by Nishiwaki, forward—was the an-i
swer. It put them up to 12 points j
and was soon raised to 15 when j
Nishiwaki scored another free throw !
and Nishikawa followed with a long i
field goal.
Meanwhile, however, the Indians I
were dropping plenty of field goals, |
with A1 Page doing the heavy work j
with the assistance of "Slim" Stew- |
art.
Visitors Are Clever
Meiji had three clever fellows—
Masuda, a 5 foot 7 center; Suzuki, a j
minute forward, and Kondo, an }
equally small guard. They showed ■
plenty of fight, but their physical 1
disadvantage was far too much to I
overcome. They pulled one sad mis- j
take of trying to work the ball too
far into the basket, and the result 1
was a frequent loss of possession.
It was just a pleasant workout i
for the Card reserves. Fuller and j
Page tied for scoring honors, with |
10 each. Palmer followed closely !
with nine.
The game closed Stanford's home i
season.
