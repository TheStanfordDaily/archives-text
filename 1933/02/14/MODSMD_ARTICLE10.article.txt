# Odds 4-1 For Beauty Over Brains, Says Rough

### SILVIA ANN COWELL 
"Must a woman be beautiful to
be loved?"
French lawyers, scientists, and
i government officials recently an
j swered this question for the, readers
! of a Parisian women's magazine.
The results of the survey show
j that beauty is of major importance
i for a girl in her teens, while mental
qualities assume an increasingly im
! port ant part in a woman's charm
as she grows older.
To satisfy local curiosity as to
whether the Stanford man's opinion
coincides with that of the French
academician, a number of' Campus
men were asked what they con
| sidered an adequate "love formula."

Disproving the theory that only |
j the French are true connoisseurs of
j feminine appeal, Stanford men, on
! the whole, have ideas strikingly
' similar to those listed in the French j
â€¢ woman's magazine.
Although somewhat hazy as to J
what they desire in a woman of,
fifty (because of alleged lack of ex
perience), sons of Stanford are in
accord that a girl of tender years
should h;,ve about 80% beauty and
20% mental coquetry.
In a woman of thirty, 50% beauty
will pass, while 15% intelligence,
15 r ; physical coquetry, 10% gener- I
osity, and a dash of mental coquetry
are required to make up the differ
ence.
