Willi an invention which will
make an almost instantaneous ana
lysis of the contents and quality of
alcoholic liquors, Professor Jaroslav
Heyrovsky of Charles University,
Parague, Czechoslovakia, will ar
rive February 27 at Stanford Uni
versity for a series of lecturers un
der auspices of (he chemistry de
partment.
Heyrovsky's invention, the polar
ograph, is a new instrument for
chemical analysis of substances,
liquid or solid, which automatically
registers on a paper both the kind
and amount of chemical substances
present.

Among the uses for the invention
is that of analyzing alcoholic bever
ages. By the pressing of a button
the polarograph will at once draw
telltale curves on the paper, which
will tell exactly the kind of alcohol
the liquor contains as well as (he
percentage.
Professor Heyrovsky is scheduled
to address the last four meetings of
the Chemistry Seminar during the
winter quarter, and will lecture at J)
o'clock on Wednesday and Friday
mornings during the first three
weeks of March. He will also con
duct a seminar on Saturdays of the
three weeks from 10:10 to 11:30
