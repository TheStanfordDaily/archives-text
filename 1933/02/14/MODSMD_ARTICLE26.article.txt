# "Buy American" Policy Would Be Injurious: Haley
## Says U.S. Needs Foreign Trade Expansion 
### 
Assailing domestic trade isolation
| and "Buy American" policies as an
j economic boomerang to national
; welfare, Dr. B. F. Haley, head of
the Department of Economics,
warned yesterday against the dan
! gers of a boycott on foreign goods.
"If the purpose of the.trade isola
! tion or "Buy American" campaign is
to injure other nations by reducing
I our purchase from them, the cam
j paign may conceivably be a suc
| cess," said Dr. Haley, "but if the
| purpose is to'air] American business
! to recover from the depression, it
| cannot possibly succeed."
In concise terms, Professor Haley
| applied the rules of international
trade that he said have proved an
' unfailing barometer of success or
j failure in foreign markets.
"If we buy less from other coun
-1 tries," he stated, "they must *f ne
i cessity buy less from us, unless we
! give or lend them the means of
i payment. To the extent that we suc
! ceed in injuring the business of
j other nations, to that same extent
| we will injure ourselves.
"Even if the crudely nationalistic
j aims back of the campaign were de
j sirable, the proposed program is a
j foolish means to those ends," Dr.
j Haley concluded. He emphasized the
| need for continued expansion of
I foreign trade for the benefit of la
j bor, agriculture, industry, and busi
i ness in California.
