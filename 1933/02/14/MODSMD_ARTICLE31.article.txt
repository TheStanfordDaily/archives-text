# PREFERENTIAL VOTING
## 
### 
In spile of I Ik* commonly known ('net thai women's gov
ernment hereabouts is something of a farce, I lie* manner in
which I hey run their elections has the A.S.S.U. system
hacked off the map. Under the present scheme, when the
associated students begin in February to select officers
they are lucky if they linish the job in trine to begin the May
elections with a clean slate. I here have been as many as
three rcvotes in an attempt to secure a majority for one
candidate.
The way Ihe women gel around il is to issue ballots with
blanks lor lirsl, second, and third choices for each office.
Having belore llicm the three choices of each voter listed
one, two, three, in preference, they can shuffle the ballots
around until one woman has a majority, the proportion
necessary to elect.
Among the amendments to the A.S.S.U. constitution to
be submitted to the students today is one which institutes
prclerential voting lor student body posts. Outside of the
minor theoretical objection tlwit second and third choice
marks on ballots might be executed without due considera
tion, there is only one possible squawk that could be legiti
mate, and that would come from the election board which
will have to put extra effort into counting ballots.
lint il was the chairman of the election board who pro
posed Ihe change, figuring il woujd be less work to finish
things up in one more complicated ballot-counting than to
hold two, three, or four elections.
A check opposite Ihe "yes" on Ihe amendment is ;i check
for belter student government.
