# ESCAPE FOR THE LINDBERGHS
## 
### 
Word comes from France (licit Colonel Charles Lind
bergh plans lo lake his family lo Kurope and establish ;i
permanent residence, mid Waller Wiiiehell communis over
111*' air, "I doifl blame hi mi."
Probahlv nobody else docs. Certainly the New Jersey
estate can recall nothing but unhappy memories lo the
minds of the living colonel and his wife. Perhaps in oilier
lands lliey can find the rights to "life, liberty, and Hie pur
suit of happiness" Which have been denied them in their
own I nited Stales. Last week's attempt to kidnap the
Lindbergh baby, coming so soon after the national disgrace
ol Charles Augustus .Ir.'s abduction and death, must have
convinced the parents that happiness and peace will never
be Iheir lot in their native land.
In the Creek conception of tragedy, which implies great
misfortunes befalling a hero of high station, Colonel Lind
bergh stands as America's truly tragic figure. Catapulted
lo fame and fortune by his daring solo hop across the Al-
Jantic, Lindbergh became the hero and idol of America.
Ilis engagement and marriage were matters of national
interest, lie could no more have escaped the public nature
ot his private affairs than lie could have respanncd the
Atlantic on a gallon of gasoline. Similarly, when tragedy
struck within his family circle, he was again the center of
a wave of national sentiment.
Never since that day he landed in Paris has Lindbergh's
Jilt 1 been his own. Perhaps a home in France would help
him reclaim his lost private existence. Perhaps in Europe
the Lindberghs would find escape from further persecu
tion by kidnapers and from what must be the equally dis
tressing public expression of sympathy. America owes the
unhappy family a "good-by and good luck."
