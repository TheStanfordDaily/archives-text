# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Everyone has met these modern
young things who come gurgling up
to you, and spill over: "I hate to
tell you; but I hope you'll pardon
my frankness if I tell you that your
tie looks like last year's stamping
ground of a herd of hungry ele
phants." The tie might or might not
be a bit wrinkled. It matters not.
They have spilled over and are
happy.
The answer to my gripe is "Hon
esty is the best policy," and if the
tie is a bit mangled, why not say so?
The pain and effort for this frank
ness is the answer. These women
writhe and twist—stew and stutter
—to make a frank remark. And hon
esty for honesty's sake may be fine;
but frankness for effect's sake is
unbearable.
Everything in its place—no one
would expect a scientist to be any
thing but absolutely frank with his
instruments. It would be ruinous for
him to cajole a scale that was clear
ly acting in a frightful manner with
soft-soap. But the same logic doesn't
apply to the parlor and the poor un
fortunates that may be therein
found. To deliberately seek out a
wrinkle in the vest, a blonde hair
on the shoulder, or manufacture
something out of mere air in order
to prove that you are adorably frank
is entirely unnecessary.
It is all probably due to th'e scien
tific method. Accuracy is carried to
asininity so that some women can

THIS FETISH CALLED FRANKNESS

attract attention. What would or
dinarily be raw cheek is justified by
science. Then Freud probably had
something to do with it. He placed
a ban on repression—it became the
tiling to say what you really felt.
This became quite a ruse. Under
the guise of saying what you felt,
it was possible to slip over the bold
est, most startling sentences. Noi
only could you, but it became a duty
to —science demanded it. And who
could resist science, when it gave
you a great chance to be the center
of the stage—the center of the ahs
and ohs of more sensitive souls?
In fact, there is too much honesty
in the social stew. A liberal season
ing of deceit wouldn't be at all out
oi place. Nothing radical, of course,
just a little honest deceit. Nothing
startling like condensed essence of
garlic or apple-sauce—but sweet
and subtle like cinnamon.
This doesn't mean that the social
whirl must be one of sweet-smelling
platitudes and bloated bromides. An
intellectual cut now and then is
proper. But frankness for its own
dear .self is irritating.
The next one that idles up and
reminds me, for frankness' sake,
that the three key hairs are vertical
instead of horizontal to my scalp,
will meet a virile barrage of frank
ness—starting from the wrinkles at
her ankles, to her misplaced shoul
der straps with long stopovers on
her shiny nose. —Abe Mellinkoff

could resist science, when it gave
you a great chance to be the center
of the stage—the center of the ahs
and ohs of more sensitive souls?
In fact, there is too much honesty
in the social stew. A liberal season
ing of deceit wouldn't be at all out
oi place. Nothing radical, of course,
just a little honest deceit. Nothing
startling like condensed essence of
garlic or apple-sauce—but sweet
and subtle like cinnamon.
This doesn't mean that the social
whirl must be one of sweet-smelling
platitudes and bloated bromides. An
intellectual cut now and then is
proper. But frankness for its own
dear .self is irritating.
The next one that idles up and
reminds me, for frankness' sake,
that the three key hairs are vertical
instead of horizontal to my scalp,
will meet a virile barrage of frank
ness—starting from the wrinkles at
her ankles, to her misplaced shoul
der straps with long stopovers on
her shiny nose. —Abe Mellinkoff
Everyone has met these modern
young things who come gurgling up
to you, and spill over: "I hate to
tell you; but I hope you'll pardon
my frankness if I tell you that your
tie looks like last year's stamping
ground of a herd of hungry ele
phants." The tie might or might not
be a bit wrinkled. It matters not.
They have spilled over and are
happy.
The answer to my gripe is "Hon
esty is the best policy," and if the
tie is a bit mangled, why not say so?
The pain and effort for this frank
ness is the answer. These women
writhe and twist—stew and stutter
—to make a frank remark. And hon
esty for honesty's sake may be fine;
but frankness for effect's sake is
unbearable.
Everything in its place—no one
would expect a scientist to be any
thing but absolutely frank with his
instruments. It would be ruinous for
him to cajole a scale that was clear
ly acting in a frightful manner with
soft-soap. But the same logic doesn't
apply to the parlor and the poor un
fortunates that may be therein
found. To deliberately seek out a
wrinkle in the vest, a blonde hair
on the shoulder, or manufacture
something out of mere air in order
to prove that you are adorably frank
is entirely unnecessary.
It is all probably due to th'e scien
tific method. Accuracy is carried to
asininity so that some women can

attract attention. What would or
dinarily be raw cheek is justified by
science. Then Freud probably had
something to do with it. He placed
a ban on repression—it became the
tiling to say what you really felt.
This became quite a ruse. Under
the guise of saying what you felt,
it was possible to slip over the bold
est, most startling sentences. Noi
only could you, but it became a duty
to —science demanded it. And who
could resist science, when it gave
you a great chance to be the center
of the stage—the center of the ahs
and ohs of more sensitive souls?
