DANGEROUSLY YOURS (Fox)—
At (lit' Stanford Theatre.
Weak in plot, but amusing in
parts: Warner Baxter, in this film,
reminds one faintly of the sophisti
cated gentleman crook of "Trouble
In Paradise." Miriam Jordan, a new
comer, is beautiful and shows real
ability, in spite of the fact that she
carries an anchor and chain around
with her for a large part of the film.
A diamond necklace is stolen from
a society toper. The thief is dis
covered by a beauteous blonde just
entering (post-depression) the sleuth
business. She is kidnapped by, and
falls in love with, her first case, and
is ultimately accused of the" crime
she is trying to solve. Much to
everybody's surprise the Charming
reprobate comes to her rescue and
even hints at reform.
Fast moving, different, and enter
taining, the film breaks down some
what with the introduction of a
lengthy and unnecessary moral dis
cussion. And it is just a bit too much
when the hero sacrifice:: his doubt
ful, but chosen, profession to save
ihe honor of his one and only.
Herbert Mundin, as the valet
gangster, presents a series of most
amusing antics. All of the smaller
parts were exceptionally well cast
and added much to the picture's en
joyment. —Brill
TIGER SHARK (Warner)—At the
Varsity Theatre.
Edward Robinson departs from
the gangster role and becomes cap
tain of a fishing boat. In this capa
city he does a not bad job at por
traying ihe character of a kindly
braggart, an unconvincing liar. It is
a part easily to be sentimentalized:
picture the young captain breaking
the news of the death of one of hi.s
crew to the victim's lovely daughter.
But Robinson acts so quietly that
the sentiment does not become
sticky.
The plot is simple: the love and
gaiety of the Neopolitan sailor
ashore and the tragedy of sudden
death at sea. It is an old story, and
i< is one that seems to demand a
great deal of realistic handling. But

•there are times when the spectator
feels that it has been to exactly de- '
picted; there are long scenes of '
fishermen hauling fish over the side
of the boat, of fish being disposed of
at the wharf, etc. These scenes are
interesting in themselves but are
reminiscent of a stuffed examina-1
tion paper. Their place is in an edu- !
cational film.
Zita Johann acts well the part of
the wife married to her husband
out of gratitude who falls In love
with his best friend, Richard Allen,
and decides that she can no longer
1 make a go of it. These parts are
emotional but not over-dramatic.
The entire picture moves along at
an even tempo, sometimes tense,
sometimes placid, always colorful.
