Editor Stanford Daily,
Dear Sir:
There has been a lot of talk the
last couple of years about the old
time "Stanford spirit" dying out.
Perhaps the chief reason for this is
the poor yell-leaders we have had.
The spirit is still there—it is merely
sleeping, with the yell-leaders as
pillows. The spirit shown at the
U.S.C. games last week-end was
terrible, due mainly to the fact that
we had only three weak yells Fri
day night and two weaker ones Sat
urday night. The fellows are willing
to yell if they have someone to lead
them. This lack of co-operation na
turally has a bad effect on the play
(jf the team itself. Perhaps this is
also the leason why there has been
so much booing; the fellows have
to give vent to their feelings some
how, and this is the form it takes.
Isn't there some way that we can
have better yell-leaders and more
yells in the future? That is one way
that we can awaken the sleeping
"Stanford .spirit." We need more
yells and better yells. California al
ways nut-yells us; last week-end
with a half-dozen U.S.C.. supporters
in the stands they out-yelled us. We
have to do something, and better
yell-leaders seems to be the best
thing.
Respectfully yours,
