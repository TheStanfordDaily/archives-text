Reviewing last week's Carnera-Schaaf fiasco in New York, one may well
wonder at the gullibility of the American public. It was labeled by all
the inside dopesters as "in the bag," but nevertheless twenty thousand
souls gathered around to watch the song and dance. If Camera won,
declared the experts, it would be an obvious fraud. If Schaaf won, it would
prove nothing.
The drab contest dragged through a weary eleven rounds and ended
with one man in a hospital, near death. And still the ringworms
cried "Baloney."
It is just such episodes that makes us writhe with wrath at regular
appareances of self-constituted critics who denounce and expose iniquities
of collegiate football. God forbid that it ever descend to the low low
recorded in the latest heavyweight brawl.
Outside of gooc? old Ben Eastman, the best lialf-miler on (he varsity
track team seems to be one Joe Burris, transfer from Glendale J.C.
The lad led the field with 2:2 yesterday, and is supposed to have done
1:58 at Glendale.

SHORT SNORTS—They tell us that Meiji means in Japanese, "en
lightened government." So you can figure out for yourself what Meiji
University means. "Rowdy Richard" Strouse is the only member of the
present Daily sports staff to make his letter. Strouse got his, a circle "S,"
in soccer. But we have high hopes for Frank Tremaine, who is romping
around second base for the fresh ball team. . . . Polo mallets, or whatever
they call 'em, cost the owners three stone apiece. And each man buys
his own personally. Jim Ferric and Bud Deacon, members of Templeton's
track squad, are both learning to cook. —F.H.
