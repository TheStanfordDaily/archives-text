# MITTMEN STAGING INTENSIVE DRILLS FOR BEAR FIGHTS
## Stanford Boxers To Meet Blue And Gold Team February 24 
### 
Hard training was the order for
Stanford boxers issued by Coach
Harry Maloney this week in pre
paration for this Indians' journey
to Berkeley Thursday, February 24,
to meet the California leather-push
ers in the second meet of the sea
son.
The Cardinal boxers looked good
in whipping the California Agyies
last week and should give the Bears
plenty of action when they clash.
Fred Glover's victory over Clinton
Jewett, Davis captain, definitely es
tablished his comeback as a success
and places him as one of the Coast's
leading collegiate mittmen. â€¢
Yuji Imai, bantamweight from
last year's squad, recently an
nounced his intention of turning
out which will give the Cards two
strong men in the 118 pound class.
Although he lost the decision last
Thursday, "Bunny" Johnson looked
good in his bout against Joe Rosen
berg of the Aggies who has lost but
two out of 82 fights and reached the
finals in the Olympic tryouts. Lack
of experience is Johnson's biggest
handicap.
With the return of Waldo Mundy,
i the Indians will have three out
standing welterweights, the others
being Bob Quinn and Newt Ridley.
