## 
### 
Having had no opposition for more
than a week, Stanford's frosh base
ball team meets the Sequoia High
School nine this afternoon on the
yearling diamond. Scheduled for
3:15 o'clock, the contest will be open
to the public.
Several promising ball players
have been uncovered by Coach
Cuddeback. In the starting line-up
today is Bobby Grayson, initial

sacker, who is a fielder and batter
of no mean ability.
At the "hot corner" Tremaine has
been playing in fine style, as have
been Galbraith and Clark at the
other two infield positions. None of
this trio as yet has shown as much
all-around class as has Grayson, but
they have all turned in steady per
formances to date and this afternoon
should prove no exception for them.

The outer gardens are also well
taken care of with Pope. Moscrip,
and Hamilton. Franchesci and right
hander Blanchard have been divid
ing the flinging assignments so far
this year. Both will participate to
day.
Behind the plate will be sturdy
Oct Morgan who seems to have a
stranglehold on this position.
