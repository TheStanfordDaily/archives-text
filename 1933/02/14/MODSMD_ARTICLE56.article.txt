# CARD RIDERS ON WARPATH TO DOWN BAD LUCK JINX

### Bill Myers 
In spite of the flu, the rain, and
the absence of star players who
have dropped out of school, things
are looking up for the Curd poloists.
"I've been thinking somebody had
the Indian sign on us lately," said
Captain Dick Gordon, coach. "Only
one veteran of last year is now in
schoolâ€”and he's just out of the hos
pital."
Although Woody Melone, the lone
veteran, has been temporarily
stricken, and Johnny Myers, another
first-stringer, is still convalescing
from a hard attack of flu; and al
though the Redshirts have been able
to scrimmage only a week this year
on their rain-soaked field, the sea
son's prospects aren't as hopeless as
one might think.
There is Kemp Maer and Lupo
Luppen, for instance, two neophytes
on the first string who have de
veloped amazingly this season. Lup
pen has cinched the number one
berth, while Maer is a certainty to
fill the number three position left
open when Captain Pete Gillham
failed to re-register this quarter.
When Myers and Melone shake
ofl' the sick curse these four men
will make up one of the best-bal
anced teams in Card polo history,
claims Captain Gordan. Myers is a

hard-hitting back and the well
known "demon on defense." Melons
i. 1 a fast-riding forward with a good
shooting eye.
Recent additions to the varsity
squad include three sophomores and
a freshman who look as 1 bough
they'll be ready to play within a
year. These men are Getz, Ander
sen, Hcndersen, and McFarland.
