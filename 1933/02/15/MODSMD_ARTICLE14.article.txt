"Universities in Europe do not
give scheduled examinations. You
can study as long and as hard as
you want and take a final oral ex
amination over the entire work by
notifying your professor two weeks
in advance."
This was the situation which Ber
nard Kaufman, Jr., '35, witnessed
during an eight-year stay in Europe,
most of which was spent in Vienna.
Countries which Kaufman has vis
ited include England, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, France, Germany,
Italy. Hungary, and Austria.
"You don't have to go to class if
you don't want to, in fact you don't
even have to go to school," Kaufman
says. "Schools in Austria are peri
odically closed by Nazi and Social
ist riots which arise out of petty
arguments," he continued. "During

' times of peace these two parties go
out every Sunday and hold military
maneuvers in the hills. It is claimed
that the Nazists could mobilize an
army of 700,000 in five hours, and
that the Socialists could do the
same. The standing army of Austria
is only 30,000."
Kaufman told further of his many
experiences in Europe. On one oc- |
casion he made a one month's trip i
across the Alps into Italy with a !
group of scouts with an expense of j
only $14. At another time he was on j
a pleasure boat on the Danube river j
when it capsized. He was forced to
swim a quarter-mile in the strong .
current to reach shore. In 1925 he
was a disinterested bystander at a j
big riot in Austria. The demonstra- !
tion ended up as a free-for-all, as j
a result of which 300 were killed.
