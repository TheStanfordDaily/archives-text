# ATHLETES TO DEBATE COED TEAM TODAY
## Yaple, Ray Oppose Glover, Tod; Latter Advocate College For '500' 
### 
With the "Standing Room Only"
sign posted on the Women's Club
house door, the team of Maxine
Yaple and Helen Ray will clash with
varsity athletes Jay Tod and Fred
Glover at 1 o'clock today, debating:
"Resolved, That a separate college
for women should be established at
Stanford."
Interest in the debate ran high
last night as both camps issued ex
clusive statements to the Stanford
Daily.
Said the blonde Miss Yaple: "We
think it useful that women should
have the chance of living naturally
in the same college with men as a
preparation for life in the same
world as men." "And," added Theta
Helen Ray, "we believe the present
system more satisfactory for all con
cerned."
The boxing debater, Fred Glover,
retorted: "I think that it's best for
both men and women that the
women should be in a separate col
lege. Then Stanford men would not
be handicapped in classes by femi
nine beauty and brains. In a sepa
rate college women could learn the
necessary domestic arts of cooking,
sewing, and care of babies."
Arrangements for the debate are
being handled by varsity hurdler
Gus Meier. Baseball captain Ike
Livermore will wield the chairman's
gavel.
