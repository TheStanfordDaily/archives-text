# Ortiz Rubio In Talk Outlines Airway Plans
## Ex-President Of Mexico Gives Talk In Spanish 
### 
Speaking from his experience as
' engineer and his knowledge of the
j area to Ik- traversed, General Ortiz
i Rubio, former president of Mexico,
j outlined a route to be used for air-
J planes between San Francisco and
j Rio de Janeiro in his address, "Bet
j ter Means of Communication be
| twecn the Americas," delivered in
Spanish last night in the Assembly
; Hall. Dr. Percy A. Martin introduced
! the speaker and gave a free transla
tion of his speech.
At the outset Ortiz Rubio pointed
j out that Hispanic America and the
; United States are being more closely
| connected socially, economically, and
(culturally as time goes on. These
j common bonds can be strengthened
jby a more convenient and rapid
I means of communication, he hopes.
Proposed Route
| His proposed route would start in
San Francisco and go through San
Diego. As he continued with the
"plan it would pass along the West
j ern coast to Queretaro in hi.s own
! country to Mexico City. He outlined
: the beauties and places of interest
i to the tourist and archaeologist.
After Oaxaca and Guaetmala City
of southern Mexico, Managua in
Nicaragua, and Panama are the next
points of importance as the flight
proceeds southward. From Manaos
: in Brazil to Goyas would be the
most difficult, and dangerous part of
the journey as this large area of a
thousand miles is practically un
chartered and affords no landing
! fields. The rest of the route to Rio
j do Janeiro would be relatively easy.
Luncheon Today
Ortiz Rubio will be honored with
a luncheon in the Union at 12:10
| o'clock this noon. This Ls sponsored
j by Pi Sigma Alpha, political science
fraternity, and the International Re-
I lations Club. The French Table will
| also meet at this luncheon. Anyone
| wishing to attend is asked to notify

I department before noon today.
