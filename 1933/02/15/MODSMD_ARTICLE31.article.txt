# AGAIN YE ANCIENT ORDER CHANGETH

No more secrets. Whatever may have been urider the
Daily's last year's fedora is now common knowledge. The
"big shots" of Volume B.'f have been named. They have
grown up overnight from creatures of conjecture to per
sonages of Mesh and blood, and, if you're lucky enough to
walk into the editorial office, you may touch them, even
speak to them.
At the head of the list, naturally, are the associate edi
tors, those long-jittering, pessimistically expectant gentle
men .lack Allen and Don Douglass, in this case .... Allen
for his well,- what dors Allen have on the ball? â€”and
Douglass for his well, what dors Douglass have on the
ball? will battle it out for the editorship of Volume HI.
Hill Mvers. Managing Kditor. Hill, still exhausted from
his nightly wrestle with the Associated Press drop, should
be able to whip himself into shape for this all-important
struggle with the business office, with the composing room,
with the staff.
And for that vale of tears, the Women's Editorship,
Elizabeth "Pete" llewit. Good old Peter. She's been on the
editorial masthead as long as anybody, and, what's much
more important, she's been an active cog on the staff. Good
luck for this gal. She deserves what ever prestige the
women's editorship may carry with it.
Willi the journalistic proverb of "woman interest" in
mind, the female appointees for night editorship must be
mentioned first. Ellaniac Dodds and Molly Phillips will be
rivals for the women's editorship of Volume XI. In that
rivalry they will vie from Monday 'till June in buying fancy
cigarettes for the copy desk, in bringing lastv cookies to
the composer and linotyper, and, incidentally, in putting
out the paper once a week.
Rolph Malloeh, Hob Letts, Hill Cole these three will
join the veteran Dick Van Wagcnen in the more serious
career of night editorship which befalls the male of the
journalese specie. All good writers, good desk men, good
heads who can say where the "late breaks" of the news
will lake them?
Dick Strouse will be the Daii.y contact man in the pri
mary lield of intercollegiate endeavor. In short, Stroiise
vich will be the Sports Editor. Ile'll gel some of the star
athletes down on him, and he'll get the coaches to fear his
pen but it's the general impression lliat he'll be one fine
sports editor.
As the new "sex-rum-grafl" expert of the staff Hetty
Paine. She has been around long enough lo know all the
dirt, and to dig up a bit on her own, and those are the
requirements for a Daii.y Feature Editor. Jim Sandoe,
because he is a Personality, whom campus folk either like
or dislike, for his dramatic criticism, will continue as Re
view Editor. Meanwhile Pat Ricciardi, newly appointed
Associate Reviewer will work necessary sex angles on hard
boiled theatre press agents.
Hob Jones, who captures the feminine contingent on the
staff with a Hashing smile, also captured the Editorial
Hoard to the extent of the A.P. Editorship. Meanwhile Wil
lard Rungay, who is a Spokane boy, and Jay "1 dropped 22
stone" Graves attained copy editorship on the same desk.
Quite a way down on the editorial ladder, nine report
ers .won the necessary nod, and they became copy editors.
Julius Jacobs, Toniaki Nao, Helen Ilamblefon, ('buck
Ghappell, Jack Drown, Edwine Montague (golden hair did
it for Ibis gal). Dot Sweet. Dave MellinkoPT (the younger),
and Dave Cooke were the lucky people.
