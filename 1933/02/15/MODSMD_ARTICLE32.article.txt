# BULL SESSION
## THE 						BIG SLIDE 
### 
The big world on the outside
laughs at college graduates. More
than that, they wonder at college
graduates. They not only wonder
why. They, more than that, wonder
how. They wonder how people can
get through college and get a de
gree. That is a marvel to those on
the outside but not to those who go
to a college and see how it's done.
Getting a degree is not an educa
tional test. It is the result of
Machiavellian splendor—that is, it
is the result of endless planning and
plotting how to garner unils without
effort. And the system aids the plot
ter. There are so many "snaps"
floating around—and when every
thing fails, there is always a couple
of units in the Education depart
ment on hand.
Courses overlap and overlapping
one's schedule is a favorite method
of getting credit without work.
While there are some that deliber
ately get on the greased slide know
ingly, there are many more that get
on without knowing it. And there
are practically none that have not
accidentally slid through ten units
oi so—during four years.
The Administration can curb this
situation by boosting the number of
requirements. Those that are going
Into some special field like engineer
ing or medicine are fairly well
doomed and so nothing can be done
about them. The great bulk who are

i just here for lack # of something bet
ter to do, could be forced to walk
up the educational step.s rather than
sliding to a degree—on floating
power—no vibration.
Of course, the immediate squeal is
that everyone has his own interests.
Which is true—but what is more
true is that there are certain studies
that all must have before one's own
"interests" can be pursued ade
quately. These individual tastes
would not suffer. The person would
pursue them on the outside—obvi
ously.
Furthermore, a lot of people who
never knew some things existed,
would be apt to find their interest.
And what is most important is that
no one would be able to slide. We
would all have to walk. The experts
would have to get together and de
cide what things everyone should
know. And then, the rest * of us
would have to learn them, or get
out. Many would get. out. Many
i would learn.
The only argument against more
requirements is that college students
are able to make their own pro
grams. The fact that they can't
seems irrelevant. The number of
1 seniors who finally see the light and
begin to regret earlier blunders is
! astounding. The number of gradu
ates is even larger. The situation is
100 per cent pitiful.
