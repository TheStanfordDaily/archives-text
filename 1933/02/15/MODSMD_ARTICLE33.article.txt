Dear Sir:
This is an appeal to the students,
especially seniors, to get in and back
the Quad by having their pictures 1
taken. Twice this quarter it has j
been necessary to open the. studio
at a financial loss in order to build
the senior section up to a point
where it 'will compare favorably
with other years. It is certainly hard
to understand why seniors refuse to !
make an effort to "have their picture
in the book that will go down in
history as the only record of the
Class of 1933.
It is true that the two dollars re- |
quired to have one's picture in the
section may be holding up a few i
people, but certainly in a period j
lasting from October to February
one Should be able to get together
the required amount. The value of
the Quad to a senior is not re
stricted to this year, but really lies !
in the future. As such is it not
■worthwhile coming in and getting |
the picture taken?
Friday is the last day we can af
ford to keep the studio open. By
then wo must have twenty more
seniors. Let's hope that a book al
ready outstanding for its other pic
torial work won't have to fall down
on its most important section.
Sincerely yours,
