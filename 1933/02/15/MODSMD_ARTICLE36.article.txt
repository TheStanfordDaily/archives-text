Editor The Chronicle—Sir: What
I this country needs most is substan
! tially constructed mail boxes. The
' rusty, dilapidated, small iron mail
I boxes one sees attached to the fronts
| of houses and to fences everywhere
! are a disgrace to a civilized people.

mail boxes of heavy bronze and ade
quate size and made them standard
throughout the country.
