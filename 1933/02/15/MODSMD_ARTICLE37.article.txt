THE KID FROM SPAIN (United
Artists) —At the Stanford Theatre.
Three years ago, musical pictures
had a short but potent reign of
popularity. The market was Hooded
with Broadway Melodies, Hollywood
Revues, Paramounts on Parade, and
the like. But excess breeds disfavor;
this Hood soon receded, and the gen
eral public was glad to see it dis
appear.
It remained for Eddie Cantor and
Samuel Goldwyn to give motion
pictures a yearly musical extrava
ganza. And this, despite the fact that
the musical cycle had long sinco
come to an end. First it was
"Whoopee," then "Palmy Days," and
now "The Kid From Spain."
In point of production, "The Kid
From Spain" exceeds its predeces
sors. The settings are more lavish,
the chorus more beautiful, the music
and lyrics superior. But Cantor pic
tures, like those of the Marx broth
ers and other funny men, are not
dependent on these elements. If the
comedian is funny, the picture has
accomplished its purpose. If not,
nothing can save it.
In this picture, Cantor is certainly
not at his best. He is funny, but his
wisecracks, some of which are ex
ceptionally good, come at danger
ously wide intervals and with less
spoed than is safe for a rapid-fire
production. As a result, the picture
seems extremely long, and it prob
ably is.
Cantors situation, like that in
many comedies, involves his being
mistaken for somebody he is not,
and his complication in some peril
ous situation. In this case, he poses
as a toreador and is forced to prove
that he can fight bulls, which, to all
good intents, he cannot.
Those who like musical comedy
or the comedian, Eddie Cantor, will
no doubt find this picture a rare bit
of entertainment. It is good enter
tainment, and the opening scenes in
a lavish girls' dormitory should oc

caskm considerable interest in this
college town, but not nearly so much
ai> will the of the swimming
pool chorus by these radiant and
beauteous co-eds.
The reaction to this film seems to
indicate that the public is ready for
another string of musical pictures.
Warner Brothers have followed suit
with "42nd Street," a current re
lease, and other studios have pic
tures now in preparation in which
music will play a major part. This
means that music sales go up and
"Tin Pan Alley" starts its second
"Westward movement." —Rapf
