s ames: Trautman on third, Delmas
on short, Irsfeld, Maggiora and Miles
in Ihe outfield.
Delmas is a two-year veteran who
is due to have his best season in his
si nior year, while Trautman, a jun
ior, has led the hitters in three pre
season games.
New Men
Irsfeld is a senior, crashing the
varsity lineup for the first time.
Maggiora is a transfer who has fitted
into the first-string lineup nicely,
and whose hitting reminds old fans
of the redoubtable Dykes Johnston.
Miles, one of the sophomore stars
last year, is just rounding into form,
and should complete one of the
haidest-hitting outfields in late
> cars.
The success of Woltcr's 1933 outfit
rests on the stick work displayed by
the new men who are in the start
nig lineup. If they come through,
the veteran mentor can probably
look for the swift return of the con
ference crown which the Redshirts
dropped to U.S.C. last spring.

Three-fifths <>f the 500 Americans
at Jamaica are missionaries.
With ;i team boasting eight veter
ans and plenty of reserve material,
Stanford's varsity nine meets the
Drones from Santa Clara on the
Sunken Diamond at -'3:15 o'clock
today.
Taking the mound for an Indian
varsity for the first time, will be'
Coach Harry Woltcr's annual .sopho
more find, in this case big Fred
Jl< linger, who chucked creditable
ball for the Class of '35 last year.
The youngster has plenty of speed
and is fast developing a versatile
delivery that should take him
through a good season in his first
year.
Massey Improved
Starling his first season-opener
behind the plate will be "Sunny
Jim" Massey, one-letterman and un
ckrstudy last year to Captain Ike
Livermore. Massey has been show
ing plenty of improvement, and gets
the call over the Indian leader, who
is still bothered with an ailing arm.
Holding down the first and second
bases will be two more members of
die 1935 team, Gordy Mallatratt and
Jim Woolley. These youngsters have
looked in practice like the coming
sluggers of the team, and if they can
stand up under league pitching they
will be the nucleus for two more
championship outfits.
Positions
The rest of the team is practically
the same as the one Wolter has
started in the last two practice
