There is a great deal of excite
ment in the various yellow (or
merely green or pink) newspapers
nowadays concerning the possibili
ties of Babe Ruth and other paunchy
and winter-fed athletes to sign on
the dotted line and agree to play
for their respective baseball clubs
during the hot summer months in
New York, Chicago, and St. Louis.
The sporting sections of the papers
devote an important head or an im
ported picture four or five times a
week to the signing of contracts or
the refusal to sign contracts on the
part of the illustrious luminaries
who keep the old homestead in
bread and butter for ten or fifteen
years with their ability to hit or to
throw or to catch a cork sphere
rolled in twine and covered with a
couple of pieces of leather.
All this talk about salary cuts and
holdouts and irate baseball club
presidents is very interesting and
valuable as it helps to fill up the
sports sections and it helps to pass
away the suburbanite's time while
he is reading the real inside "dope"
on the eight-twelve to the City. It
is also ail very meaningless and
helps to pi'ove the journalist's con
tention that he can make suckers
out of anyone.
This baseball "dope," like all
sports "dope," is merely the ver
bose mutterings of hack writers who
have learned (especially if they are
paid by the inch) to write many
jocular words about nothing in a
manner that will force the reader to

! believe that he is on a great secret.
Such stuff is "gufi" in sports lingo,
and it is well named. Some of the
longest are called yarns, which is
even better.
For sports pages are created by
the readers, not by their editors.
They print what people want to
read, and people prefer poorly writ
ten sports tripe to well-written. And
since newspapers must sell and since
the paying public likes to hear about
the injured toe-nail of its favorite
football' star or the pulled hair of
its (at the moment) champion run
ner or the salary disputes of its
baseball hero, the sports sections go
j right on saying nothing in many
words.
It sometimes occurs lo me that
, sports writers must be those lucky
i individuals born without con
| sciences. Certain it is that sports
news sounds unconscientious. In
fact, it isn't even news; its practice
at typewriting by men who would
have done well had they become
stenographers in the first place.

at typewriting by men who would
have done well had they become
stenographers in the first place.
There is a great deal of excite
ment in the various yellow (or
merely green or pink) newspapers
nowadays concerning the possibili
ties of Babe Ruth and other paunchy
and winter-fed athletes to sign on
the dotted line and agree to play
for their respective baseball clubs
during the hot summer months in
New York, Chicago, and St. Louis.
The sporting sections of the papers
devote an important head or an im
ported picture four or five times a
week to the signing of contracts or
the refusal to sign contracts on the
part of the illustrious luminaries
who keep the old homestead in
bread and butter for ten or fifteen
years with their ability to hit or to
throw or to catch a cork sphere
rolled in twine and covered with a
couple of pieces of leather.
All this talk about salary cuts and
holdouts and irate baseball club
presidents is very interesting and
valuable as it helps to fill up the
sports sections and it helps to pass
away the suburbanite's time while
he is reading the real inside "dope"
on the eight-twelve to the City. It
is also ail very meaningless and
helps to pi'ove the journalist's con
tention that he can make suckers
out of anyone.
This baseball "dope," like all
sports "dope," is merely the ver
bose mutterings of hack writers who
have learned (especially if they are
paid by the inch) to write many
jocular words about nothing in a
manner that will force the reader to

! believe that he is on a great secret.
Such stuff is "gufi" in sports lingo,
and it is well named. Some of the
longest are called yarns, which is
even better.
For sports pages are created by
the readers, not by their editors.
They print what people want to
read, and people prefer poorly writ
ten sports tripe to well-written. And
since newspapers must sell and since
the paying public likes to hear about
the injured toe-nail of its favorite
football' star or the pulled hair of
its (at the moment) champion run
ner or the salary disputes of its
baseball hero, the sports sections go
j right on saying nothing in many
words.
It sometimes occurs lo me that
, sports writers must be those lucky
i individuals born without con
| sciences. Certain it is that sports
news sounds unconscientious. In
fact, it isn't even news; its practice
at typewriting by men who would
have done well had they become
stenographers in the first place.
