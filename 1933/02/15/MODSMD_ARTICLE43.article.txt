### Bob Letts 
Coach John Bunn started prepara
tions with his Stanford varsity bas
ketball team yesterday afternoon to
defeat the representatives of the
Los Angeles Junior Chamber of
Commerce, U.C.L.A., this week-end
in the Southland.
In addition to having the perennial
dispute between the two sections of
California to settle, Mr. Bunn's bas
keteers will seek to vanquish the
ft ruins twice ;i*id thus permit Coach
"Caddy"' Works' five to lay claim to
the cellar championship of the Pa
cific Coast Conference southern di
vision. It is likely that the locals
will achieve their ambition.
Still Peeved
Still a little peeved at having lost
two games to Southern California
here last week after having a fr.irly
firm grasp on the second encounter,
(he Indians went through a stifl ses
sion yesterday which saw them
working on a new variation of their
offense. A fast-breaking, seldom
stopping five—one that isn't spas
modic—is Stanford's chief need.
Bunn has had such combinations
several times this season, but they
have invariably weakened after a
short while.
The Cards and Bruins split their
opening series here two weeks ago,

and since that time both have been
, taking regular beatings. U.C.L.A. ;
( put up a strong show against Cali
fornia last Friday and Saturday
nights in Los Angeles, losing the
second contest by a single point. On
that basis, it will be a big favorite
to beat Stanford.
Fancy Dribbling
The Indians' workout yestei ; day
also saw the squad going through
some fancy dribbling practice, some
thing which, if perfected, should al
low for greater speed in offensive
plays. Everybody handled the casaba
well, but nobody was showing too
1 much speed.
Si ill workouts today and tomor
row will finish off training here, and
the party will leave Thursday eve
ning, arriving in Los Angeles Friday
• morning.
