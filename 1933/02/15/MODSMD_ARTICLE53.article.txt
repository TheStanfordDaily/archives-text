# Yearling Hoop Five Nears Close Of Successful Year
## 
### 
With only three games remaining
on the freshman basketball sched
ule, two of them against high school
teams, Rabbit Bradshaw's yearling
quintet is Hearing the home stretch
of one of the most successful sea
sons in Stanford history.
FiHday night the Papooses play
mediocre Pittsburg High's team. On
Saturday, traditionally strong Palo
Alto High will furnish the opposi
tion. The latter game is an annual
affair for the freshmen, and during
recent years has invariably ended
in favor of Hod Ray's prep quintet.
Captain Addie Barnett, who hurt
his ankle in the first few minutes
of the Mission High game last Sat
urday, was not in a suit at practice
yesterday, but expects to play
against Pittsburg and Palo Aito. The
exact nature of Barnett's injury has
rot been determined. Coach Brad
shaw believes it is merely a painful
ankle bruise.
