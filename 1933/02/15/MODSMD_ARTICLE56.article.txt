NEW YORK, Feb. 14 (A I )—A new
ira in transportation, with regula
tion concentrating on insuring the
most efficient service at the lowest
competitive cost, is envisaged in the
report of the national transportation
committee, published tonight.
This report, the result of more
than four months of work, most of
which was under the direction of
the late Calvin Coolidge, has been
anxiously awaited by large investors
in the Nation's $20,000,000,000 rail
load system, who invited formation
of the committee to see solutions for
the vexed transportation problem.
Urge Rail Consolidation
The committee's conclusions —
based on one of the most thorough
surveys that has ever been made of
the Nation's transport facilities by
a disinterested, nonpartisan body—
find the outlook for the roads "far
from hopeless," but assert that rates
cannot be based on obsolete capital
structures, nor can competing forms
of transportation be handicapped for
the benefit of the railroads.
The committee urges sweeping
consolidation of the roads, on a re
gional basis, to eliminate vast and
wasteful duplication of facilities and
services, and that these groupings
be enforced by governmental action
where necessary, looking eventually
to a single national system.
Emergency Measures
As an emergency measure, facili
tation of reorganizations where nec
essary to reduce unwieldy and un
economic capital structures, is urged
by revision of bankruptcy proce
dure. No broadening of the lending
powers of the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation is found neces
sary, although the committee points
out that "adequate security" for
loans does not necessarily mean
"marketable collateral."
