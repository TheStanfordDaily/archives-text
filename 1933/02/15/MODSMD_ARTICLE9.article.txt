# English Club Will Present German Film
## 
### 
A well-rounded program of en
tertainment will be the English
Club's offering tomorrow night in
the Assembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock
when that organization will present
a double film bill to students and
public. Student tickets are unre
served, and priced at 25 cents.
The featured film will be the out
standing German U.F.A. picture,
"Othello," which stars Emil Jan
nings, the eminent actor who dis
tinguished himself in American si
lent pictures, notably "The Way of
All Flesh" and "The Blue Angel."
Jannings gives a virile characteriza
tion of the Shakespearean hero, and
he is supported by Lya de Putti,
who appeared with him in the
U.F.A. film, "Variety."
Werner Kraus, star of "The Cabi
net of Dr. Caligari," appears as
lago. With him as Desdemona is lea
Lenkeffy, prominent Viennese.
The other film on the bill is, by
way of contrast, Charlie Chaplin in
"The Immigrant," one of that come
dian's early two-reel successes. A
recent Chaplin revival, "The Cure,"
was a distinct success, and this
promises to be wholly as amusing.
Tomorrow night's presentation is
not the first sponsored by the Eng
lish Club, that, organization having
sponsored many former film and
cultural programs, including the
notable "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."
