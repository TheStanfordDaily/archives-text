Wooden soldiers
in the war against decay
To conquer the forces of decay which attack
telephone poles, scientists of Bell Telephone Lab
oratories carry on a relentless campaign.
They study many kinds of wood, test many
preservatives. They isolate wood destroying fungi
and insects —study them in the laboratory—search
for a practical means of combating their attack.
They have set out armies of stub poles in Mis
sissippi, Colorado and New Jersey where altitude,
climate and soil vary widely. At regular intervals
they inspect these poles to learn which woods and
preservatives are best.
Such scientific thoroughness is one reason why
Hell System plant becomes more efficient each year.
And why telephone service is so dependable.
