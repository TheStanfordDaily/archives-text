# CARD HOOPMEN LEAVE TONIGHT FOR SOUTHLAND
## Two Tussles With U.C.L.A. Scheduled To Decide Cellar Position PREVIOUS PAIR SPLIT Indians Confident Of Win; U.C. Stopped Bruins' Star Basketeers 
### 
Coach John Bunn and his Stan
ford basketball team entrains for
(he South tonight to battle Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles in
an effort to break the existing tie
for the cellar position of the Pacific
Coast Conference southern division.
Two games will be played, Friday
and Saturday nights, in the new
Westwood gymnasium.
Each team has scored its only con
ference victory of the season at the
other's expense. They split a two
game series here three weks ago.
Indians Confident
Stanford goes South feeling confi
dent of at least splitting the remain
ing two battles with the Bruins, and
harboring the feeling that it will be
possible to stretch the point into a
week-end of real enjoyment.
The necessity of stopping two
Ucla hot shots-—Captain Don Piper,
forward, and George Brotemarkle,
guard—will present itself before the
first game is well under way. The
Indians are basing their hopes of
keeping these two deadcyes in check
on the fact that California was able
to turn Ihe trick last week-end.
Two Bruin Deadeyes
Piper's ability to drop shots from
any angle makes him a dangerous !
foe, while Brotemarkle's well- j
trained orb has spotted the basket j
from distance spots on the floor j
regularly all season. Brotemarkle
was a thorn in Stanford's side ear- j
lier this season.
In addition to having two good
shooters, Coach Caddy Works will
have the added advantage of having
the games on his own court.
Stanford hopes to stop the South
erners' attack easily enough, but is
worried over the problem of pierc
ing the U.C.L.A. defense with suf
ficient consistency to pile up the
needed points.
Topping Mainstay
Keith Topping, whose general
floorwork has been the main reason
for Bunn working up a fair team,
will be playing in his home terri
tory. He will have a lot of friends
and former teammates in the stands
watching him strive to keep among
the leading scorers in the confer
ence. It will be an added incentive.
Captain Tom Cordry has been
spending a lot of time this week
getting his eye back in shape, and
should be hot.
It's Stanford's last real chance to
lengthen its abbreviated string of
conference victories.
