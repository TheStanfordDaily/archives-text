# WOMEN TIE WITH MEN IN DEBATE
## Gain Moral Victory Against Separate College 
### 
While a packed Women's Club
house thundered applause, and var
sity hurdler, Gus Meier, valiantly
guarded the gates against swarms
of "new-college" enthusiasts who
attempted to crash the meeting,
Maxine Yaple and Helen Ray yes
terday afternoon argued athletes
Jay Todd and Fred Glover to a
tied audience decision on the ques
tion: "Resolved, that a Separate
College for Women Should Be Es
tablished at Stanford."
The men attempted to flatter their
way to victory by pronouncing their
opponents the "two most beautiful
Stanford women." But Yaple and
Ray responded in the same tone that
the men were attempting to use
their masculine charm to sway the
audience. (The audience was pre
dominantly male.)
The Palefaces feared that Todd
and Glover were attempting to get
rid of them by shoving them into 'i
separate college. Todd replied: "We
are making no effort to get rid of
Stanford women, but rather an ef
fort to secure for them training as
wives and mothers."
To the male protestations that the
greatest benefit to the "500" would
result from a separate institution,
Miss Yaple replied with a "Yes,
Father Todd and Father Glover."
s Even though the decision was a
tie, the moral victory lay with the
women. The men admitted that the
Stanford women were the intellec
tual superiors of the rough.
