# Predestination Governs Choice Of Student Head
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
Predestinat ion gave the doctrine
of freedom of the will a new jolt
yesterday when current research on
the subject was revealed. College
students who are continually study
ing the complicated interworking of
the many factors determining the
behavior of the human race arc
.shown in be themselves the particu
lar victims of a newly discovered
determinant.
Student body presidents have al
ways been considered the choice by
the students of the best man for iho
job. Thi.s proves to be another illu
sion of the student voter. Be he ever
so well qualified, a man has little
chance if he happens to bo a major
in, say, Romanic languages. If, in
addition, he should also come from
northern California or the East he
might just as well forget his politi
cal yearnings.
Statistics show that 62.5 per cent
of Stanford student body presidents
are law or pre-legal students.
Three-fourths of them come from

California. The native sons all hail
from either central or southern
parts, the same number coming :
from each.
When the freshman fills out resi- j
dence and major Study in his regis
tration booklet his fate would ap- '
pear to be sealed. One remarkable |
exception has been discovered.
In the early years of the century j
there arrived a man from Milpitas. |
He enrolled in law and his career j
flourished.'He became successively]
a varsity debater, head yell leader, j
business manager of the Daily, class i
president, and finally president of
the Associated Students. The con- I
elusion might be drawn: law major
traits, dominant; home town, reces
sive.
Quite different factors limit the
A.W.S. presidency. Most of the wo
men have come from Palo Alto.
There is but one case of a law
major getting the office, while his
tory has proved most conducive to
capturing the job.
