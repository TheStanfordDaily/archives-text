# RENOVATIONS PLANNED FOR ENCINA LOBBY
## New Upholstery, Radio And Piano To Be Installed In Three Weeks 
### 
Encina's woe-begone and much
; dilapidated lobby is to be restored
| to some of its former glory within i
the next three weeks, so Charles '
Karl, Student Manager, informed its I
! residents at the first frosh smoker !
| last night.
Improvements will come from the j
; Encina Club Improvement Fund,
j which has been built up to around
I $2500 by dues from past classes.
Encina History Recalled
Much-needed floor lamps, new
wiring system, a radio, a piano, and
new upholstering, arc among the
planned additions. The Class of 19HG
gave Karl its assurance that it
I would appreciate the new lobby fur-
I nishings, and not subject it to the
customary rough Encina treatment.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth, who
| spoke to the frosh preceding Karl's
j announcement, recalled the place
I that the famous lobby has had in
past Stanford history. In the early
! days of the University it was the
I only social hall on the campus. Here
i were held all dances; and here were
I served the only meals available 011
|
the campus for men, women, and
I faculty alike.
Lobby Now Bare
When Encina was the only men's
\ dormitory 011 the campus, it was a
.sought-for privilege to be an in
habitant. The Club was then a
powerful political and social organi
zation. Of recent years the hall has
aged and deteriorated rapidly,
mainly due to the fact that living
in the hall has come to be consid
ered a duty and the residents no
longer hold the property of the club
in rcspect.
At present, the lobby is dimly-lit;,
and almost barren. A few old rugs
and hard wood seats, whose up
holstery blazed up in the Big Game
bonfires of '28 and '29, alone re
main of its once proud lobby. Soon,
such is the aim, it will be livable
and enjoyable again, attempting to
rival the home-like quality of the
Toyon and Branner lobbies.
