# Finders Fail To Cash In With Military Ball Bids
## 
### 
Apparently the students who j
picked up the three free bids for
the Military Ball that fell out of the j
sky Tuesday noon, are not dance- ,
minded. At a late hour last night j
none of the bids had been ex
changed for regulation bids.
It was rumored that two of the i
tickets were found, but names of
the lucky students and official con- |
firmation were lacking at press time.
Finders of the free bids m;iy ex
change them at the A.S.S.U. offices
in the Union for official bids, ae- |
cording to Paul Wendell, chairman
of the dance. Programs for the ball,
scheduled for tomorrow night in the i
Women's dance studio, are now j
available at the student offices and j
may be had on presentation of a
bid, costing $3. Only a few bids still
on sale.
