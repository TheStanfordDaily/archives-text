# RIGHT UP WITH THE REST, AT LAST
## 
### 
For sonic lime now the I"nivorsilv has sadly conceded
ilscll as ranking only second or third lo such institutions
as the I diversity of Southern California and the Univer
sity ol \\ ashington in the field of raucous publicity for
campus dances. Last year a Washington dance chairman
had himself kidnaped on the eve of the affair; down south
they also know how those things should be done.
Mill now at last, alter smarting so long under this feel
ing ol inferiority, the campus can hold up its head. The
recent press-agentry for Scabbard and Blade's military ball
(see front page for latest developments) has undoubtedly
brought Stanford into the front rank in this line.
\\ hethcr or not the three bids which promoters of the
affair say were dropped from a plane flying over Mayfleld
last Tuesday have been found or not, the idea undoubtedly
deserves commendation. Chairmen of other dances slated
for the next few months are shaking envious heads. Tt is
certain that this stunt has set a new all-time mark for fu
ture publicity experts to shoot at. The campus can settle
back now, assured that with this sterling example before
it Stanford need no longer be relegated to the rear ranks
when the bids are selling for campus dances.
