# COPS ON THE JOB
## 
### 
A win lor campus law and order was scored I lie oilier
day when a Palo Alio judge sentenced a former Stanford
.janitor to sixlv days imprisonment for robberies committed I
on llie campus. Sixty days is a long time to pay for the
theft of the average Stanford man's watch, hut the sentence
was .just.
Dormitory and fraternity house robberies have been
matters of course around here for longer than anybody
cares lo remember. Once in a while a petty thief is appre
hended, but majority of campus crimes have, in
the past, gone undetected.
I he Stanford police force, all two of them, are not quite
so unaware ol the extent of this campus robbery epidemic
as their record of arrests and convictions may indicate.
With a Farm full ot men of irregular habits, students who 1
are theoretically suspects lor each succeeding "job," and
with the Dean's files as the only available rogues' gallery,
the campus cops have done surprisingly well. Their work
is slow, carcful, and intelligent, and, above nil. it is done
quietly, with no typical brass-button Hare for publicity and
mysterious sensationalism.
