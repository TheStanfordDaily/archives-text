# INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT

### 
A Chicago dean, .1. I'. Jewell, has boon i_jivi 1114 freshmen '
some advice 011 how lo get good marks, lie warns against
100 much independence of thought, and adds thai "A"
students are usually the ones who are careful not to dis
agree with instructors.
This hit of counsel sounds like the kind a worldly sopho
more might give a first year man. Hut since a Dean of an
important university has seriously offered it, the statement
is worth some comment.
Ccnertilly speaking, it takes more intelligence and more:
knowledge of a subject to disagree with the instructor than!
to nod in agreement. Excepting the annoying students who
always disagree with their teachers 011 principle, it is al
most certain that a student arguing with his professor is
above the general level of his class. To disagree with the
text or the teacher, a student must bo thoroughly familiar
v ith their point of view as well as with some other. Such
a student deserves a better mark than one who is willing
to accept his professor as the final authority.
Korcod acceptance of a certain point of view is foreign
to the spirit of a university. A modern university, like Chi
cago or Minnesota, lias an army of scholars at work, draw
ing conclusions only after they have weighed all evidence'
on both sides. Should these scholars, who are the faculty
of a university, teach their classes only one side of a con
troversial question and lower the mark of a student who
introduces evidence on the yither side?
