## LOVE AT LAGUNITA 
### 
When the moon comes up, and
ihe mosquitos come out—'tis the
time, according to storybooks, when
the blind lead the blind to the
.shores of Lagunita, into a canoe, and
out upon the magic waters. It is an
old custom—one that never needs
editorials to bolster it—or yell kings
t<» lead it. It flourishes always.
Then, there are always some like
myself who like to canoe for the
exercise. We also have an interest
I
in the dear old lake— from a muscle
if dot from a heart appeal. But all
this splendor will be the glory-that
was if some playful students fail t<-
curb their playful urge.
Last year, there was a very piti
ful story on the Lake —that death is
well known to all. And so far this
quarter, there have been several
narrow escapes. If some of these es
capes were just a bit thinner—and
materialized into tragedies for the
City papers, the Administration
would probably cease collecting
water in the hollow behind Roble.
Then, there will not be any Lagu
nita. There will only be corn fields.
And while I suppose the boys back
in loway take the girl friends walk
ing in the corn, I imagine everyone
here would rather stick to the moon
lit waters.
There is a difference between li
brary tables and canoes. The for
mer are nailed to the floor. This
little difference deserves attention—
at least more attention than has pre

viously been accorded it. A canoe
will rock. A table is not as apt to
turn over. But students persist in
treating canoes as library tables.
Result: students in the water with
the canoe, frogs, and pollywogs.
Everybody stays on top of the
water except the students. They be
gin thrashing around in a hopeless
fashion. There is a life-preserver in
the canoe which also floats. The
purpose of the enlarged doughnut is
to hold the student above the water.
Therefore the student is asked to
hang on the preserver. Upon shout
ing, some boat-house attendant will
proceed forth and lift the student
from the water.
This seems very simple—but too
tame or not simple enough for a
drenched collegian. For the shore,
splash the erstwhile lovers—in bold
Weissmuller style. But, alas, only
for about 50 feet. Then, down they
go — water in the gills — mighty
screams — 1 finally, they are dragged
out three shades darker than a sum
mer sky in the face, and one stage
from drowning.
For our great campus lovers, we
can keep Lagunita—only by hanging
on to the preservers after slipping
over; and not by slipping over
through unnecessary carelessness.
And when I am pulled out—choking
and dripping—it will be no cause
for laughs. It will most probably be
one of those little (unavoidable) ac
cidents. —Abe MellinkofT
