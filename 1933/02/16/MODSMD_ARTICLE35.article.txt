### OLD DR. ALGAR 
lfl-HO EVERYBODY
EDITOR
COLLEGE HUMOR:
Why didn't the "rat" who wrote
that cowardly, insulting attack on
Rudy Vallee sign his name? Rudy
signs his name to everything he
wi'ites. Now, if you had brains
enough to do that and could stop
"editing" such a filthy magazine,
you would be famous and rich and
respectable like Rudy.
He is as clean and wholesome as
he is clever. His "product" proves
it. Mr. Vallee attracts very superior
people. I saw five hundred women
of breeding and culture—the wives
and daughters of the most famous
men in the world—honor Mr. Rudy
Vallee as guest artist at the luncheon
where the Women's Congressional
Club entertained Mrs. Herbert
Hoover. She was so charmed with
Mr. Vallee that, she paid him the
great honor of being photographed
with him, then invited him to the
White House to meet the President.
So you see the "right" kind of
people—not your kind of people but
"our kind of people"—admire, re
spect and honor Rudy Vallee.
