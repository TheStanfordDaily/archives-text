THE STANFORD ART GALLERY:
Women Painters of the West.
An exhibition embarrassingly
hung in the main gallery and en
titled "Women Painters of the West"
is interesting only in that it arouses
curiosity as to why Mr. Lemos did
not include in it at least one good
woman painter from the West. The
pompous title presents a show as
unindividualized and inevitable as
might be expected. The heavily pur
pled mountains with snow, the
poppy fields bending down to blue
oceans, and the flower bows are all
here, lacking for the most part even
adequate draughtsmanship or com
position to conceal their insincerity
as art. Elsa Escherich's "Evening"
is freer from this organic emptiness
than any of the other oils, and its
composition is good. Miss Eseherich
has had intelligence enough to ob
serve French painting.
The most pleasing of the seascapes
is Evylena Miller's, done in the
Ritschel manner, although it is
spoiled by the inappropriate color
ing of the background. The over
emphasis of color elsewhere in the
gallery, however, somewhat com
pensates for Miss Miller's faux pas.
As to the still-life groups, I was cer
tain that the same amateur had
painted them all, until I discovered
from the placards that actual signa
tures proved quite the opposite. The
women represented in this exhibit
are mainly from the Laguna Beach
colony, so that the exclusion of good
Carmel and San Francisco female
artists, as well as those of New
Mexico, makes their inclusive title
seem doubly pretentious.
It is a relief to pass into the room
where Seward Rathbun's water
colors are still on display. This art
ist's sensitive designs of dwindling
old houses, conceived with clear

simplicity, arc deft as well as hu
man. His Quebec studies are charm
ing (with the exception of the Ma
donna) in the same way as some of
his landscapes, but all of his figures
are badly executed. A strong tend
ency toward sentimentality often
overcomes the quiet humor of his
better sketches. His deft drawing- -
at times too delicate—is frequently
played false by an over-use of blues
and greens in coloring. "Northwest
Wind" is perhaps the best of the
watercolors.
I need make no comment upon
Berton Crandall's photographs. Last
quarter Mr. Lemos promised a series
of excellent camera exhibitions, for
which we must evidently continue
to wait. —Broughton

THE STANFORD ART GALLERY:
Women Painters of the West.
An exhibition embarrassingly
hung in the main gallery and en
titled "Women Painters of the West"
is interesting only in that it arouses
curiosity as to why Mr. Lemos did
not include in it at least one good
woman painter from the West. The
pompous title presents a show as
unindividualized and inevitable as
might be expected. The heavily pur
pled mountains with snow, the
poppy fields bending down to blue
oceans, and the flower bows are all
here, lacking for the most part even
adequate draughtsmanship or com
position to conceal their insincerity
as art. Elsa Escherich's "Evening"
is freer from this organic emptiness
than any of the other oils, and its
composition is good. Miss Eseherich
has had intelligence enough to ob
serve French painting.
The most pleasing of the seascapes
is Evylena Miller's, done in the
Ritschel manner, although it is
spoiled by the inappropriate color
ing of the background. The over
emphasis of color elsewhere in the
gallery, however, somewhat com
pensates for Miss Miller's faux pas.
As to the still-life groups, I was cer
tain that the same amateur had
painted them all, until I discovered
from the placards that actual signa
tures proved quite the opposite. The
women represented in this exhibit
are mainly from the Laguna Beach
colony, so that the exclusion of good
