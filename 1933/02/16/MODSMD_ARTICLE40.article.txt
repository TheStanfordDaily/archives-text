WITH ANOTHER UPSTART
SPORTS EDITOR already moving
lis out, us once we moved our pre
decessor out, and a new staff to look
for trouble in the sports world, we
should like to leave a few grains for
your pipe, a few for con- ,
templative chewing.
We should suggest the fol
lowing changes wherever they
may do the most good:
1. While sweaters for the sen
ior managers of both major and
minor sports.
2. Make all your minor sports
members of the same classifi
cation.
15. Make tennis a minor sport
along with golf, polo, and the
rest.
4. I .ay off the booing at ALL
athletic contests around here.
And to back the.se up: la. There
is no reason why a manager should
receive a cardinal sweater for two,
Ihn-e, or four years' work when an
athlete can get one in two years. II
you think that a manager's life is a
bed of roses, go out for track man
ager and see how much sleeping you
can do on the job.
If you don't choose to make
all minor sports the same, you
are just putting off the inevi
table. There is no logical reason
why there should be a differ
ence.
Why tennis should bo a major
sport, and golf, swimming, and the
rest minor, is a mystery that has
puzzled us for four years. There is
no sense to making a minor sport
into a major sport, but there is a
good deal of sense in making into a
minor sport a major sport that never
should have been a major sport.
As far as booing goes, we
should not have to say anything,
but it seems that we must. Stan
ford is fast acquiring, in fact
possesses already, a reputation
as the most unsportsmanlike
university on the Pacific Coast.
Most of this has come from the
silent attention given basketball
here, but the hoop game is not
the only one lliat gets the Bronx
cheer. Boxing comes in for more
than its share of jeers, and there
are others. But the point is: it
isn't particularly masculine to
boo. In fact, it isn't even intclli- '
gent, (lie way most Stanford
jeerers use it. If you just can't
get along without booing, learn
WHAT to hood and WHEN to
do it! Bob Wade
