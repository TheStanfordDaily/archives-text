# Santa Clara Rally Stops Card Ball Team, 7-6
## STANFORD HOLDS ONE RUN LEAD AS LAST INNING OPENS Broncos Collect Fourteen Hits Off Heringer, Estes, Stark 
### 
Santa Clara came back with a
vigorous ninth-inning rally to de
feat Stanford's rather ragged team
of ball players 7 to (5 on the Sunken
Diamond yesterday. In the eighth
the Indians had gained the lead for
the first time in the game, and en
joyed a G to 5 advantage as the last
inning opened.
Heringer started the game in the
pitcher's box for Stanford with Mas
sey behind the plate. This pair left
the game in the sixth inning and
turned the burden over to Ike Liv
ermore and Herm Estes. Starke j
pitched the last inning for Stanford.
Santa Clara greeted Heringer in
the first inning with three singles
that culminated in a tally for the
Broncos. Cunningham, Bechrich, and 1
Judnich all hit safely in turn, and
Cunningham crossed home plate
with the first run.
Indians Tie Score
Stanford tinkered around until
the third inning when they woke i
up and, coupling a clean hit with a
pair of walks, scored to tie up the I
game. Burke lost control momen
tarily and let Maggiora walk. Del- •
mas singled, Mallatratt walked, and
with the bases completely occupied,
Burke pulled a faux pas for the
baseball elite. He walked in a run.
A hit by O'Donnell and a double
to left field by Golson gave the lead
to Santa Clara again in the fourth
inning, but the game went to dead
lock when Massey came home for
the Cards in their half of the in
ning.
That soring lead rolled around
like an inebriated sailor. Now you
have it, now you don't! Cunningham
drove out a triple and Judnich fol
lowed up with a single in the next
inning and the effort was good for
Iwo more Santa Clara runs.
Teams Stage Rally
Stanford came to bat with plenty
of determination, but this trip they
were able to add only one run to I
their total. And that was a bit of a
fluke, because O'Donnell held Mas
f.ey's grounder up at first, hesitating
between a peg to Burke covering
the bag or to home plate to cut off
a run. In the delay Irsfield managed j
to beat the throw and scored from
third on a close decision.
Santa Clara and Stanford each
picked up another run in the sixth
and the eighth opened with the
visitors in the lead with a precari
ous one run margin.
Stanford put on one weird exhi
bition of plain and fancy base run
ning, while the Broncs added some
wild errors in that eighth frame,
Stanford came out on the long end
of the deal to score two runs and
take the lead for the first time.
Broncs Batter Stark
Delmas scored the first run after
gaining base on an error. The next
tally was a sort of joint affair. Bul
ler pinch-hit for Estes, Millsap ran
for Buller from first to third, and
Maentz ran for Millsap from third
on homeward. The whole progress
was aided and abetted by Santa
Clara errors.

Cunningham crossed home plate
with the first run.
Indians Tie Score
Stanford tinkered around until
the third inning when they woke i
up and, coupling a clean hit with a
pair of walks, scored to tie up the I
game. Burke lost control momen
tarily and let Maggiora walk. Del- •
mas singled, Mallatratt walked, and
with the bases completely occupied,
Burke pulled a faux pas for the
baseball elite. He walked in a run.
A hit by O'Donnell and a double
to left field by Golson gave the lead
to Santa Clara again in the fourth
inning, but the game went to dead
lock when Massey came home for
the Cards in their half of the in
ning.
That soring lead rolled around
like an inebriated sailor. Now you
have it, now you don't! Cunningham
drove out a triple and Judnich fol
lowed up with a single in the next
inning and the effort was good for
Iwo more Santa Clara runs.
Teams Stage Rally
Stanford came to bat with plenty
of determination, but this trip they
were able to add only one run to I
their total. And that was a bit of a
fluke, because O'Donnell held Mas
f.ey's grounder up at first, hesitating
between a peg to Burke covering
the bag or to home plate to cut off
a run. In the delay Irsfield managed j
to beat the throw and scored from
third on a close decision.
Santa Clara and Stanford each
picked up another run in the sixth
and the eighth opened with the
visitors in the lead with a precari
ous one run margin.
Stanford put on one weird exhi
bition of plain and fancy base run
ning, while the Broncs added some
wild errors in that eighth frame,
Stanford came out on the long end
of the deal to score two runs and
take the lead for the first time.
Broncs Batter Stark
Delmas scored the first run after
gaining base on an error. The next
tally was a sort of joint affair. Bul
ler pinch-hit for Estes, Millsap ran
for Buller from first to third, and
Maentz ran for Millsap from third
on homeward. The whole progress
was aided and abetted by Santa
Clara errors.
Stanford went out in order at
their turn to bat in the last half of
the ninth.
Santa Clara came back with a
vigorous ninth-inning rally to de
feat Stanford's rather ragged team
of ball players 7 to (5 on the Sunken
Diamond yesterday. In the eighth
the Indians had gained the lead for
the first time in the game, and en
joyed a G to 5 advantage as the last
inning opened.
Heringer started the game in the
pitcher's box for Stanford with Mas
sey behind the plate. This pair left
the game in the sixth inning and
turned the burden over to Ike Liv
ermore and Herm Estes. Starke j
pitched the last inning for Stanford.
Santa Clara greeted Heringer in
the first inning with three singles
that culminated in a tally for the
Broncos. Cunningham, Bechrich, and 1
Judnich all hit safely in turn, and
Cunningham crossed home plate
with the first run.
