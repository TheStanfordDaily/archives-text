# TANK POLO STARS BATTLE OLYMPIANS TOMORROW NIGHT
## Smaller Pool Will Hamper Indians; Stiff Fracas Seems Certain ' 
### 
Stanford's varsity tankmen meet
the Olympic Club water polo team
in the Post Street pool at 8:30 o'clock
tomorrow night in what will un
doubtedly prove to be one of the
Indians' hardest battles of the
league.
The club's shorter and narrower
pool will undoubtedly be an effec
tive handicap to Coach Nort Thorn
ton's men, as it will hinder their
fast-breaking Hungarian offense.
However, the Stanford team is prac
ticing in the short diving pool this
week and is adapting its attack and
defense to the limitations of a
smaller playing area.
Ted Wiget, star distance swimmer
and water polo guard, will compete
in the Senior P.A.A. 220-yard free
style championship race, which will
be held on the same program before
the water polo game. He should
have little difficulty beating Ralph
Gilman of the Olympic Club, who
will be his chief competitor.
