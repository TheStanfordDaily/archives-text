# COACH BUNN STARTS CAMPAIGN AGAINST BOOING IN SPEECH BEFORE SEQUOIA CLUB
## 
### 
Driving the entering wedge in a
campaign against booing at basket
ball games, Coach John Bunn of :
the Stanford quintet talked last
night during dinner at. the Sequoia ,
Eating Club.
"Although I realize that most of
you who boo have a da In good time 1
doing it, it is still poor sportsman- i
ship. Stanford was the last to start i
booing at the games, now let vis try i
to be the first to stop it." Coach i
Bunn deplored the hissing and boo- <
ing during free shots by the oppos- 1
ing team as the worst sort of bad
sportsmanship. "You would not i

think of booing at a tennis match
so why any more at a basketball
game."
When asked about the refereeing,
Bunn remarked that lie thought "the
officiating was putrid" but hastened
to add that in his opinion it was in
part the fault of the coaches. "The
book of rules was never made to be
obeyed to the letter," he said, "and
the referees do not know what kind
of a game the coaches want played."
Bunn hopes much from a conference
ol coaches and officials next year
but even so the "personality and
judgment of the officials could be
much improved."
