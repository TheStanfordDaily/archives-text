## New Style In Tennis Wear Displayed On Varsity Court By Loser 
### 
Setting a new style in men's ten
nis wear, Jack Cosgrove yesterday
walked out on the varsity courts at
tired in a natty blue, stream-lined
shirt, and played Glenn Reed in one
of the most interesting matches of
the early net season.
Reed won by scores of (i-4, (5-3, in
play that was closer than the straight
set victory indicates. The match was
to decide who holds number four
position on the varsity, for the time
being, at least, and set scores seem
to put Reed in the coveted position.
Potential Timber
Potentially one of the finest net
men on the squad, Cosgrove has not
gotten into tennis form this season
as fast as the other six men, and as
a result bis ladder record is any
thing but impressive. Surplus weight
plus poor footwork at the present
time are ruining an otherwise good
net game, for Cosgrove's strokes are
probably better than any man's on
the squad besides Captain Coughlin.
Reed, who upsets the usual order
of things in sport, by wearing thick
horn-rimmed glasses on the courts
and taking them off the rest of the
time, has been the major surprise
of all Lockwood's first ten players.
His half Eastern-half chop ground
strokes make him one of the finest
doubles players.
