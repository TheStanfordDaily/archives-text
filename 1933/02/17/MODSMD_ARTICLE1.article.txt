# INDIANS AWAIT UCLA BATTLES AT WESTWOOD
## Squad Faces Last Chance To Score Double Win In One Week-end SCHNETKA IN LINEUP Forward Don Piper Chief Menace To Cards 
### Bob Letts 
Stanford faces its last opportunity
of the season to score a double win
in a week-end of Pacific Coast Con
ference basketball competition when
it encounters University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles this evening and
tomorrow night in the Southerners'
gymnasium.
After the U.C.L.A. series, but one
game—the final battle with Califor
nia—will remain on the Indians'
schedule.
Coach John Burin, Manager Don
Cameron, and 10 players left Palo
Alto last night and were scheduled
to arrive in Los Angeles early this
morning to take a limbering-up
workout in the Westwood pavilion
this afternoon and then go into se
clusion until the tipoff.
Schnetka Starting
Those making the trip were: for
wards, Capt. Tom Cordry, Hal Ede
len, Payne Palmer, and A1 Page;
centers—Keith Topping and Fred
Schnabel; guards—John Hancock,
Jay Tod, Bill Schnetka, and "Chuck"
Rogers. Bunn announced a starting
lineup last night which consists of
Cordry and Edelen, forwards; Top
ping, center, and Hancock and
Schnetka, guards.
Schnetka's appearance in the
starting lineup is not too big a sur
prise'. He is displacing Jay Tod to
give the latter a rest after a season
of real work. Tod has fought his
heart out. all season, and Bunn feels
that a rest may restore some of the
potency that marked Tod's early
season play.
Piper Menace
Meanwhile, Schnetka will be in a
pisition to provide the needed spark
in the Stanford offensive. If he is off
to a good start, he can do a lot of
damage to the Bruins.
The chief worry of the Cardinals
will be to stop Capt. Don Piper, the
high-scoring U.C.L.A. forward, and
George Brotemarkle, a long-shoot
ing guard who hits as often as he
misses. Stanford's defense will cen
ter on these two boys, and unless
Coach Caddy Works is able to pro
duce another pair of hot shots from
Gibson, Maxwell, and Capt. Lemcke,
Stanford may ride back to the Farm
with two victories.
