# BOGGS PRAISES MACDONALD ACT
## Move To Enlarge Scope Of Debt Meet Lauded 
### 
Lauding the action of Prime Min
ister Ramsay MaeDonald in accept
ing a wider scope for the Debts con
ference in Washington next month,
Professor T. H. Boggs, of the Eco
nomics department, declared that
the inclusion of the program which
has been tentatively prepared for
the World Economic Conference to
be held in Europe this summer is
a highly desirable move on eco
nomic as well as logical grounds.
"The problem of the Debts is in
extricably interlaced with such
questions as currency and exchange,
restriction on international trade,
tariff policy, the movement of cap
ital, prices, and the gold standard,"
Professor Boggs declared. "An at
tempt therefore to pluck the Debts
issue from its natural setting in
order that it may be discussed and
"solved" on its own individual mer
its (whatever that phrase may
mean) would seem destined to fail,"
he stated.
In conclusion, Professor Boggs
declared that a satisfactory solution
of the war debts problem "would of
necessity involve the fullest possible
consideration of all pertinent data."
