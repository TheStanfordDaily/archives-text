# Varsity Invades Santa Clara To Battle Broncos
## Saturday's Tilt Second Conference Contest of Year; Indian Nine Favored to Avenge Wednesday's Defeat; Stark, Estes Look Good 
### BOB WADE 
Having presented the first conference game of (lie year to Coach Walter
Mails' oft-erring Broncos last Wednesday, Stanford's big-hearted ball
players invade the Santa Clara stronghold for the second contest of the
series, at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow, bent on wiping out the sting of their
initial effort. Stanford spent the afternoon Wednesday trying to give the
visitors a ball game, and finally managed to do it, although the Broncs
out-errorcd them 8-5. However, since then the Indians have bad a long
session at the blackboard and another on the field, so they ought to lie

able to come out on top tomorrow.

One thing that tended to offset the
painful part of the first exhibition
was the fact that the tail-end of the
batting order did a good deal of
what hitting was done, and as soon
as the regular clouters get their
batting eyes into action Wolter
should have a ball club with a really
potent attack.
Of the three ehuckers used, Harry
Stark and Herm Estes gave the best,
performance, but Fred Heringer will
probably look better now that his
first game is behind him. The big
sophomore go' a lot of tough breaks,
via "Texas leaguers," in his six in
nings on the mound, and he will be
out for revenge.
Pitcher Undecided
What Wolter's starting selection
for pitcher will be is more or less
conjecture, but the chances are that
it will be either Stark or Savimke.
Stark has a lot on the ball this year,
having finally gotten his stuff under
control, and from his pre-season ex
hibitions it seems that he has
learned to keep cool when his team
fails to back him up, as was the
case Wednesday.
Whether Wolter will choose to use
Lefty Campbell, should the game re
quire a substitute pitcher, is an
other question that is tough to an
swer. The youngster has a lot on the
ball, and he needs experience, but
Wolter may feel that it is too soon
to try him out in league competition.
The rest of the starting team will
probably shape up much as did the
team that opened against the Broncs
in the first encounter. Massey,
catcher; Mallatratt, first base; Wool
ley, second; Trautman, third; Del
mas, short; and Irsfeld, Maggiora,
and Miles in the outer gardens.
Possible changes are Livermore be
hind the plate, and Neuman or Nut
ting in left field. Big fke is just
rounding into the form that made
him Wolter's first string receiver
last season, and he may crash th •
starting lineup for a change. Neu
man is probably the best, fielder on
the squad, while Nutting's reputa
tion is based on his ability as a lit i
ter de luxe.

first game is behind him. The big
sophomore go' a lot of tough breaks,
via "Texas leaguers," in his six in
nings on the mound, and he will be
out for revenge.
Pitcher Undecided
What Wolter's starting selection
for pitcher will be is more or less
conjecture, but the chances are that
it will be either Stark or Savimke.
Stark has a lot on the ball this year,
having finally gotten his stuff under
control, and from his pre-season ex
hibitions it seems that he has
learned to keep cool when his team
fails to back him up, as was the
case Wednesday.
Whether Wolter will choose to use
Lefty Campbell, should the game re
quire a substitute pitcher, is an
other question that is tough to an
swer. The youngster has a lot on the
ball, and he needs experience, but
Wolter may feel that it is too soon
to try him out in league competition.
The rest of the starting team will
probably shape up much as did the
team that opened against the Broncs
in the first encounter. Massey,
catcher; Mallatratt, first base; Wool
ley, second; Trautman, third; Del
mas, short; and Irsfeld, Maggiora,
and Miles in the outer gardens.
Possible changes are Livermore be
hind the plate, and Neuman or Nut
ting in left field. Big fke is just
rounding into the form that made
him Wolter's first string receiver
last season, and he may crash th •
starting lineup for a change. Neu
man is probably the best, fielder on
the squad, while Nutting's reputa
tion is based on his ability as a lit i
ter de luxe.
Having presented the first conference game of (lie year to Coach Walter
Mails' oft-erring Broncos last Wednesday, Stanford's big-hearted ball
players invade the Santa Clara stronghold for the second contest of the
series, at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow, bent on wiping out the sting of their
initial effort. Stanford spent the afternoon Wednesday trying to give the
visitors a ball game, and finally managed to do it, although the Broncs
out-errorcd them 8-5. However, since then the Indians have bad a long
session at the blackboard and another on the field, so they ought to lie

able to come out on top tomorrow.
Ileringer Improved
One thing that tended to offset the
painful part of the first exhibition
was the fact that the tail-end of the
batting order did a good deal of
what hitting was done, and as soon
as the regular clouters get their
batting eyes into action Wolter
should have a ball club with a really
potent attack.
Of the three ehuckers used, Harry
Stark and Herm Estes gave the best,
performance, but Fred Heringer will
probably look better now that his
first game is behind him. The big
sophomore go' a lot of tough breaks,
via "Texas leaguers," in his six in
nings on the mound, and he will be
out for revenge.
