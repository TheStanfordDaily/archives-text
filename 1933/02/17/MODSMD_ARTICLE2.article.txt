# Lagunita Canoes Must Carry Life Preservers
## 
### 
No canoe will be allowed on
Lagunita after today which does not
carry a life preserver, Fred Teb
betts, head life guard, announced
yesterday. The life preservers must
be of standard canvas-covered cork
make and may be bought at cost at
the boathouse, Tebbetts said.
A floodlight was being installed
on the boathouse yesterday for use
in emergencies, and it is palnned to
install spotlights also. Life pre
servers have already been mounted
on each raft on Lagunita.
