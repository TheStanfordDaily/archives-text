# OPEN LETTER-THE LAST
## 
### 
I )i AH Fhitz :
Last night you s;iid if I had any advice to give you, to
tell it to you and spare the three thousand and some sub
scribers of this sheet the agony of reading a lot of blurb.
You were right, hoy. This swan song business in the edi
torial column is getting to be a tradition, and, like most
traditions, it does nobody any good. Every editor for the
I);i st several years will support that point. Yet each wrote
his swan song, introduced it by admitting that it was a
lousy idea, and ran it anyway. It's a disease, I swear.
You'll have it yourself after four and a half months as
chief of this rag.
* * *
Though 1 realize that few give v a damn about it but
myself, I can't help looking back over the half year just
[last. Like you are today, I once was planning to set the
world oil tire, to correct this, fix that, and gel lower prices
at the I nion. It didn't take me long to find out that nobody
cared a helluva lot what I thought about how things ought
to be run around here, and that what was wrong would go
right on being wrong in spite of heaven and high water.
The funny thing about it, Fritz, is that the things you
plan carefully and work hardest to put through seldom
Your biggest triumphs will just sort of happen,
'!i < my planning. Look at that Axe business, for cx
;:mp'' lere it was, the perfect symbol of Big (lame ri-
Ihcring rust in a Palo Alto bank vault. It couldn't
'i lit out and paraded around, or the Berkeley mob
have torn up the quad in an effort to get it. It
be left in the vault. All the Daily had to do was
hat it be put up ;1s a Big (lame trophy, and it was
is done, with no opposition. A perfect setup. Yet
s satisfaction in taking advantage of that setup.
Thai's the way it's been with most every victory, Fritz.
Abolishing the Big (lame bonfire was another example of
finding something ripe, and plucking it. It wasn't senti
ment for the bonfire that was supporting that blaze; it was
sentiment for the past. Nothing more to do there than to
get the students to realize that fact.
Then that improvement in the manner of selecting yell
khigs. The system was so inadequate on the face of it that
the change had to come, (letting a Hi-Jinx-to replace the
Junior Opera, eliminating a few of the minor class offices,
those, 100, were things that were already leaning in the
right direction, needing only an editorial nudge to push
over completely.
But the prize opportunities, Fritz, the situations that
will make your lingers fairly itch to get at a typewriter,
come seldom. They supply the supreme joys of editorship.
Only one came my way, and that was recently, just when
it looked as though Volume would end without once
having a chance to push in a beagle that some person of
importance had projected.
But hell, kid, I didn't mean to go into such detail over
what's past. After all, my purpose in this letter was to
hand you a bit of guflf that I knew you would ignore, but
which I hoped might give me the opportunity to say, later,
"1 told you so." One warning. Fritz, if I know you as well
as I think 1 do. For God's sake, keep your beagle in. I
know, a good battle is lots of fun, and a dead paper is a
horrible bore. But that beak of yours is no longer that of
a private citizen, one who can spout his radical ideas with
abandon. More than three thousand subscribers are itch
ing to point out that whatever you have to say is wrong.
And more than umpty limp powers of the faculty and ad
ministration have ten thousand arguments to prove that
the change you want to make in this, or that, is absolutely
out of the question.
There are a few things, Fritz, that I hope you will carry
on. That is for you to decide, of course. But some of them
arc so obviously worthy of support that 1 know you won't
object. First is the student relief program. If you ever
have to decide which of two charitable causes to put on
the front page, top right, that's the one to boom.
Then Panhellenic. Someday, perhaps, the women will
learn that rushing is not successful in proportion to the
number of rules that are imposed. I'ntil that day, how
ever, you can scream yourself hoarse without result. Per
haps it would be best to go on making a joke out of the
futile lloundcrings of the .">OO in their ajtempts to govern
themselves. As a matter of fact, it would be difficult to
improve on the humor that is already there.
However it goes, fellow, you're a cinch to be a success.
With a couple of high powered associate editors and a
good staff all around, you can't miss. It's going* to be a lot
of work, a lot of grief, and a lot of fun. And about the time
vou begin to realize that you're the editor it will In- all
over. (lood luck, boy.

Abolishing the Big (lame bonfire was another example of

But hell, kid, I didn't mean to go into such detail over

hand you a bit of guflf that I knew you would ignore, but
which I hoped might give me the opportunity to say, later,
"1 told you so." One warning. Fritz, if I know you as well
as I think 1 do. For God's sake, keep your beagle in. I
know, a good battle is lots of fun, and a dead paper is a
horrible bore. But that beak of yours is no longer that of
a private citizen, one who can spout his radical ideas with
abandon. More than three thousand subscribers are itch
ing to point out that whatever you have to say is wrong.
And more than umpty limp powers of the faculty and ad
ministration have ten thousand arguments to prove that
the change you want to make in this, or that, is absolutely
out of the question.
There are a few things, Fritz, that I hope you will carry
on. That is for you to decide, of course. But some of them
arc so obviously worthy of support that 1 know you won't
object. First is the student relief program. If you ever
have to decide which of two charitable causes to put on
the front page, top right, that's the one to boom.
Then Panhellenic. Someday, perhaps, the women will
learn that rushing is not successful in proportion to the
number of rules that are imposed. I'ntil that day, how
ever, you can scream yourself hoarse without result. Per
haps it would be best to go on making a joke out of the
futile lloundcrings of the .">OO in their ajtempts to govern
themselves. As a matter of fact, it would be difficult to
improve on the humor that is already there.
However it goes, fellow, you're a cinch to be a success.
With a couple of high powered associate editors and a
good staff all around, you can't miss. It's going* to be a lot
of work, a lot of grief, and a lot of fun. And about the time
vou begin to realize that you're the editor it will In- all

Last night you s;iid if I had any advice to give you, to
tell it to you and spare the three thousand and some sub
scribers of this sheet the agony of reading a lot of blurb.
You were right, hoy. This swan song business in the edi
torial column is getting to be a tradition, and, like most
traditions, it does nobody any good. Every editor for the
I);i st several years will support that point. Yet each wrote
his swan song, introduced it by admitting that it was a
lousy idea, and ran it anyway. It's a disease, I swear.
You'll have it yourself after four and a half months as
chief of this rag.

Though 1 realize that few give v a damn about it but
myself, I can't help looking back over the half year just
[last. Like you are today, I once was planning to set the
world oil tire, to correct this, fix that, and gel lower prices
at the I nion. It didn't take me long to find out that nobody
cared a helluva lot what I thought about how things ought
to be run around here, and that what was wrong would go
right on being wrong in spite of heaven and high water.

come seldom. They supply the supreme joys of editorship.
Only one came my way, and that was recently, just when
it looked as though Volume would end without once
having a chance to push in a beagle that some person of
importance had projected.
But hell, kid, I didn't mean to go into such detail over
what's past. After all, my purpose in this letter was to
hand you a bit of guflf that I knew you would ignore, but
which I hoped might give me the opportunity to say, later,
"1 told you so." One warning. Fritz, if I know you as well
as I think 1 do. For God's sake, keep your beagle in. I
know, a good battle is lots of fun, and a dead paper is a
horrible bore. But that beak of yours is no longer that of
a private citizen, one who can spout his radical ideas with
abandon. More than three thousand subscribers are itch
ing to point out that whatever you have to say is wrong.
And more than umpty limp powers of the faculty and ad
ministration have ten thousand arguments to prove that
the change you want to make in this, or that, is absolutely
out of the question.
There are a few things, Fritz, that I hope you will carry
on. That is for you to decide, of course. But some of them
arc so obviously worthy of support that 1 know you won't
object. First is the student relief program. If you ever
have to decide which of two charitable causes to put on
the front page, top right, that's the one to boom.
Then Panhellenic. Someday, perhaps, the women will
learn that rushing is not successful in proportion to the
number of rules that are imposed. I'ntil that day, how
ever, you can scream yourself hoarse without result. Per
haps it would be best to go on making a joke out of the
futile lloundcrings of the .">OO in their ajtempts to govern
themselves. As a matter of fact, it would be difficult to
improve on the humor that is already there.
However it goes, fellow, you're a cinch to be a success.
With a couple of high powered associate editors and a
good staff all around, you can't miss. It's going* to be a lot
of work, a lot of grief, and a lot of fun. And about the time
vou begin to realize that you're the editor it will In- all
over. (lood luck, boy.

I )i AH Fhitz :
Last night you s;iid if I had any advice to give you, to
tell it to you and spare the three thousand and some sub
scribers of this sheet the agony of reading a lot of blurb.
You were right, hoy. This swan song business in the edi
torial column is getting to be a tradition, and, like most
traditions, it does nobody any good. Every editor for the
I);i st several years will support that point. Yet each wrote
his swan song, introduced it by admitting that it was a
lousy idea, and ran it anyway. It's a disease, I swear.
You'll have it yourself after four and a half months as
chief of this rag.
* * *
Though 1 realize that few give v a damn about it but
myself, I can't help looking back over the half year just
[last. Like you are today, I once was planning to set the
world oil tire, to correct this, fix that, and gel lower prices
at the I nion. It didn't take me long to find out that nobody
cared a helluva lot what I thought about how things ought
to be run around here, and that what was wrong would go
right on being wrong in spite of heaven and high water.
The funny thing about it, Fritz, is that the things you
plan carefully and work hardest to put through seldom
Your biggest triumphs will just sort of happen,
'!i < my planning. Look at that Axe business, for cx
;:mp'' lere it was, the perfect symbol of Big (lame ri-
Ihcring rust in a Palo Alto bank vault. It couldn't
'i lit out and paraded around, or the Berkeley mob
have torn up the quad in an effort to get it. It
be left in the vault. All the Daily had to do was
hat it be put up ;1s a Big (lame trophy, and it was
is done, with no opposition. A perfect setup. Yet
s satisfaction in taking advantage of that setup.
Thai's the way it's been with most every victory, Fritz.
Abolishing the Big (lame bonfire was another example of
finding something ripe, and plucking it. It wasn't senti
ment for the bonfire that was supporting that blaze; it was
sentiment for the past. Nothing more to do there than to
get the students to realize that fact.
Then that improvement in the manner of selecting yell
khigs. The system was so inadequate on the face of it that
the change had to come, (letting a Hi-Jinx-to replace the
Junior Opera, eliminating a few of the minor class offices,
those, 100, were things that were already leaning in the
right direction, needing only an editorial nudge to push
over completely.
