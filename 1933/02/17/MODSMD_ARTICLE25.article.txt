# BULL SESSION
## ZANGARA MISSES 
### 
Despite Vanity Fair's cock-sure
prediction that Jack Garner would
be the greatest assurance that
Roosevelt would never be assassi
nated, stomach-troubled Joe Zan
gara attempted that act the other
night at Miami. He missed, and bar
ring better shots in the near future,
Franklin D. Roosevelt will continue
to smile and be inaugurated on
March 4th.
What would have been the result
to Roosevelt if the lead had been
better aimed? The first and obvious
result is that the great son of Demo
cracy would be cold and dead. Fur
ther than that, results are not so
clearly foreseeable. Very possibly, it
would have made him a national
hero—squelched the boos that his
picture was drawing in the local
movie palaces fit practically the very
moment the fatal lead was missing
him.
Dead, Roosevelt would have been
a martyr. Alive, he is simply a
Democrat. And the difference be
tween martyrs and Democrats is in
finite. A martyr is a thing to praise
and bow to. A Democrat is usually
a thing to scorn, and in this year,
a thing to rail against. The dead
Franklin would be the subject of
glorious editorial comment—loud
praise. It is not far afield to
prophecy that he would no doubt
be canonized along with Garfield
and McKinley.
The possibilities of the situation
are without end. Here was the Moses
to lead the people out of the eco
nomic wilderness with the NEW

! DEAL. Here was the hero who had
overcome his great physical handi
cap and was about to overcome the
great national affliction. That there
would have been hymns to his great
name is a surety. Of course, several
issues of postage stamps would have
borne a very solemn likeness of the'
smiling Frank —A1 Smith's "Old
Potato."
But now, all this glory is in the
dust. He will be another* President
to fulfill all the promises that were
made for him. He will be lambasted
for four years by a party—unaccus
tomed to a thin diet for very long.
Roosevelt, the opportunist and poli
tician. How thin and hollow—how
mundane and earthy when com
pared to the other-world grandeur
and sonority of the "Martyred
Roosevelt."
It is a certainty that "F.R." would
have supplanted "T.R." in great
ness. Yet, by a cause over which he
had no control, all this posthumous
splendor is like Clementine—lost
and gone forever. His great-grand
children, even his grandchildren,
would read in the history books all
about the Miami tragedy which
robbed the nation of its leader.
What they will read, when Roose
velt finishes his time in the White
i House, is only conjecture. Lincoln
had four years to make enemies and
even then an assassin's bullet pre
served him among the untouchable
great. Without the handicap of four
years' hate, there is no telling how
far Roosevelt might have gone—if
Zanara hadn't missed.
