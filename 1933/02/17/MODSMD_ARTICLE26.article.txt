## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 16 </P)â€”Only a
shadow of the man who knocked out
John L. Sullivan, but still a cham
pion in courage, James J. Corbett
today aroused himself from a semi
coma in which he had lain for sev
eral hours and walked about his
home.
Corbett, in his sixty-seventh year,
has been seriously ill since January
31. Yesterday morning his condition
became so alarming his physician
resorted to stimulants to prolong
his life.
This afternoon, with friends mo
mentarily expecting word of his
death, Corbett awoke, climbed out
of bed and walked Through the
house. He was prevailed upon to
lie down again, but appeared none
the worse for his unusual activity.
