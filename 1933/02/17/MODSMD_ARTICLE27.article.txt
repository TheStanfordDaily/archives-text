### 
DENVER, Feb. 16 (A 3 )—lsolated |
cabins and remote gulches in the ■
mountain country felt the tread of 1
searching police today as authorities
launched a systematic hunt of the \
rugged regions for Charles Boet- ]
tcher, 11, wealthy Denver broker, ]
who was kidnapped Sunday night |
and held for $60,000 ransom.
Stumped temporarily in their in- j
vestigation by Mrs. Anna Lou :
Boettcher's inability to identify Ar- j
nold Swanson, former Denver po- j
liceman, as one of two men who j
abducted her husband, authorities
seized upon the stories of a moLin- j
tain zoo custodian and a park po- I
liceman to branch into a new angle '
of the hunt.
