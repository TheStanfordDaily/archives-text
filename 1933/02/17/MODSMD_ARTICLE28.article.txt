RIB AT GEO. WASHINGTON'S
SNOZZLE BURNS D.A.R.
"You can't kid George Washing
ton's schnozzle in pictures and get
away with it, at least not without
hearing from the D.A.R.
"When Warners finished 'Alexan
der Hamilton' members of the Hol
lywood D.A.R. who caught the pre
view wanted to know where War
ners got off, making fun of the
schnozzle of such an illustrious
American.
"In one of the scenes Hamilton
and Count Tallyrand are toasting a
picture of the first President. Ham
ilton pipes: 'A great big heart—A
great big soul." Tallyrand finishes
with ' —and a great big nose.'"—

Physician:
If daily, with wide repetition.
Wo loudly bespoke
Just how badly we're broke
Do you think we could hudgc
