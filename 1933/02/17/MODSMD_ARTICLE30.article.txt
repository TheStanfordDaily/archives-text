PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 1(» t/P) —
Within an hour after they had held
the cashier prisoner and looted the
First National Bank of suburban
Ambler, four bank bandits today
fought a pistol battle with police,
armed with submachine guns.
One man was killed, three others
captured, and three women held as
suspected accomplices.
About $50,000 was taken from the
bank, all of which was recovered.
