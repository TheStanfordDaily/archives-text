PASTURES OF HEAVEN—By John
Steinbeck. Published by Robert
Ballon. I!).'] 2. (At Gordon Straw
bridge Lending Library.)
The second published novel by
John Steinbeck (Stanford ex -'25,
'26, '27) shows a mature and warm
power to evoke unforgettable char
acters and to inform them with
breathing life.
"Las Pasturas del Cielo," the Pas
tures of Heaven, is a green corral
of earth lying, not too explicitly,
between Salinas and the Carmel
Valley. It is a pleasant place enough,
where one might hope to escape
the contagion of cities and where
there is time for wonder. Here live,
hither come, and thither go a hand
ful of humans, <?ach seeking his own
dream and each hugging to him his
own downfall. There is the posses
sive passion of "Shark" Wicks, who
kept books on imaginary financial
transactions. There is the rage of
Tularecito, the idiot creator, whose
handiwork must be held sacred.
There is the charming shiftlessness
of Junius Ma It by, whose boy did
not know he was poor; the inno
cense of the two tamale-making
Lopez sisters; the young school
teacher's fear of knowing. Each of
these inner biographies is a study
in some human torpism. Many of
] the manifestations, although never

mean, are distinctly psychopathic;
however, the story of Pat Humbert's
secret room will touch something
familiar in all of us.
Character and setting dominate
the mood of the book, and the unity
is one of place rather than plot. The
manner is unembittered; the style,
frugal. If you like people you will
want to read thi.s story of the Mon
roe's neighbors.
