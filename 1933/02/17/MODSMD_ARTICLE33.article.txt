### Willard Bungay 
In spite of (he fact that it, has yet
to be defeated and is now leading
the Northern California League,
Stanford's varsity water polo team
will be only .slightly favored to win
from the strong Olympic Club septet
when they meet in the club pool at
ftilH) o'clock tonight.
The Indians will be at a distinct
disadvantage in the smaller playing
area of the Post Street pool, but are
attempting to overcome this diffi
culty by practicing in the small div
ing pool this week.
Same Lineup
Conch Nort Thornton will start
the .same team that has been used
in all the games this year. Ted
Wiget, Jimmy Triolo, and either
Jimmy Benet or Dick Hirsch will
open at forward; Vlad Taranik,
Gordy Graves, and Don Kinkead at
guard; and Captain Burke Knapp,
goal guard. Jack Murietta and Leo
Cook will undoubtedly be used be
fore the game is over.
Ted Wiget, National Intercollegi
ate 440-yard free style champion,
will swim in the Senior P.A.A.
Championship race which will be
held on the same program. Wiget
should have little difficulty winning,
but the race may tire him for the
water polo game.
Tcbhetts in 150
Captain Fred Tebbetts will repre
sent Stanford in the Senior P.A.A.
150-yard backstroke championship
race, which will also be held on the
