# Frosh Nine Will Meet Poly High
## 
### 
Undefeated in two starts, Coach
Murray Cuddeback's frosh baseball
team steps into fast competition to
morrow morning when it meets a
nine from Poly High of San Fran
cisco. Scheduled for 10 o'clock, the
game will ho staged on the yearling
diamond.
Although nothing definite is
known of the city boys' strength,
the babes are anticipating a tough
forenoon. To date the frosh boast of
a clean slate, having trouncedÂ»San
Mateo High 10 to 1 and eked out a
4 to 3 victory over Sequoia High
School.
Cuddeback has not decided who
will do the flinging, but if he follows
his usual procedure, Franchesci and
Blanchard will divide the assign
ment. In the Sequoia engagement,
Tuesday, Franchesci looked pretty
good, fanning three victims in the
last inning.
Backstop Oct Morgan will com
plete the opening battery and should
develop into quite a catcher if he
can perfect his pegs to the bases.
The "errorless wonders" which
have been good for one double plav
per game will comprise the infield.
Grayson has been hitting very well
in addition to holding down the first
sack, while Galbraith, Clark, and
Tremaine have been fielding in
great style to round out the airtight
combination.
Hard-hitting Bones Hamilton,
Monk Moscrip, and Pope form the
capable trio of outer garden men
who will start the contest tomorrow.
