WELL, WE HAVE PROB
ABLY given the campus more
pains in our four months at litis
joh than any other editor who
has ever sat in the chair, so
just to show that our heart is in
the right place, we will give you
one good laugh before leaving.
It seems that a young man was
out with one of Stanford's young
women the other night, and in the
course of conversation he found out
that she was interested in tennis.
Being a versatile youngster, he has
at times given lessons to the young
sons of those who still have enough
money to pay for lessons in this
great social asset, and thinking that
he would give himself a boost, he
offered to help her.
The next day they appeared on
the courts with the required pupil
teacher appearances; he looking like
a natty professional, and she like a
struggling beginner.
The sometime "pro" shot over his
first sorvice and charged to the net
for a smash. Her return met him
squarely between the eyes. She took
the game easily, and the next, her
first chance to serve, she ran out
with four straight aces.
In the end, he merged on (he
short end of two love sets, and
went home to think it over. The
following day he chanced to
glance at the sports page of a
city paper. His "protege's" name
led the national rankings in jun
ior singles and, I believe, junior
doubles.
AND NOW THAT THAT'S
OVER, we want to introduce
you, and You, and YOU to your
new sports editor. Ladeez and
genuhnen, I 'ave the 'onor t«>
present for your approval the
Right 'onorable Richard Benja
min Strouse, '34, soccer player,
honor student, and one darned
good fellow. If you don't know
him already, you ought to get
out and meet some of the im
portant people around this 'ere
place who do things.

We give up the chair to Dick with
envy because he is just starting and
with pride because we can be one
o fhis readers. The youngster has
come along as fast as anybody on
the staff, and if he doesn't make a
good sports editor it will be because
Stanford doesn't have any sports.
It's been fun to run the col
yum, and fun to work with the
staff. To our cheerers (yes, you,
Horace!) and jeerers alike, hasta
manana. Luck to you, Dick!

honor student, and one darned
good fellow. If you don't know
him already, you ought to get
out and meet some of the im
portant people around this 'ere
place who do things.

We give up the chair to Dick with
envy because he is just starting and
with pride because we can be one
o fhis readers. The youngster has
come along as fast as anybody on
the staff, and if he doesn't make a
good sports editor it will be because
Stanford doesn't have any sports.
It's been fun to run the col
yum, and fun to work with the
staff. To our cheerers (yes, you,
Horace!) and jeerers alike, hasta
manana. Luck to you, Dick!

WELL, WE HAVE PROB
ABLY given the campus more
pains in our four months at litis
joh than any other editor who
has ever sat in the chair, so
just to show that our heart is in
the right place, we will give you
one good laugh before leaving.
It seems that a young man was
out with one of Stanford's young
women the other night, and in the
course of conversation he found out
that she was interested in tennis.
Being a versatile youngster, he has
at times given lessons to the young
sons of those who still have enough
money to pay for lessons in this
great social asset, and thinking that
he would give himself a boost, he
offered to help her.
The next day they appeared on
the courts with the required pupil
teacher appearances; he looking like
a natty professional, and she like a
struggling beginner.
The sometime "pro" shot over his
first sorvice and charged to the net
for a smash. Her return met him
squarely between the eyes. She took
the game easily, and the next, her
first chance to serve, she ran out
with four straight aces.
In the end, he merged on (he
short end of two love sets, and
went home to think it over. The
following day he chanced to
glance at the sports page of a
city paper. His "protege's" name
led the national rankings in jun
ior singles and, I believe, junior
doubles.
AND NOW THAT THAT'S
OVER, we want to introduce
you, and You, and YOU to your
new sports editor. Ladeez and
genuhnen, I 'ave the 'onor t«>
present for your approval the
Right 'onorable Richard Benja
