# BEARS MEET TROJANS IN DECIDING SOUTHERN DIVISION SERIES GAMES
## 
### 
The Golden Bears of California
will attempt to conquer their highly
favored foes from the University of
Southern California tonight at Ber
keley in the opening game of the
deciding scries of Southern Division
basketball. In order to stay in the
running for league honors California
must take both of the games from

the Trojans.
Although the Bear team suffered
two defeats at the hands of S.C. last
month, local fans are looking for an
upset and the new gymnasium is
sold out. Led by sensational Jerry
Nemer the Southern outfit is a top
heavy favorite to annex at least one
of the g::mes and thereby cinch the
title.
