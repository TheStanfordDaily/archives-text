# CAMPUS SET FOR MILITARY BALL; FREE BID CLAIMED BY WALKER
## 
### 
With all bids sold, work was well
under way last night on the decora
tions for tonight's Military Ball at
the Women's Gym. All regular bids
for the affair were sold Wednesday
night, but the committee arranged
for twenty-five extra ones which
were disposed of yesterday, making
the total number sold 225.
Only one of the free bids thrown
from the sky Tuesday was re
claimed, according to an announce
ment last night by John Robb. That
one was redeemed by William

Walker, who .suid he found it
the faculty clubhau.se. Decorations
are in a military motif and consist
of various army and war department
flags, while the gym will be amply
protected by a French 75 mm. field
gun, a 37 mm. gun, and several ma
chine guns. Griff Williams' orchestra
will furnish the music, the band's
'Baldwin piano being furnished by
Musical Hage of the Stanford Music
Shop. Doors will be watched by a
detachment of enlisted men who will
effectively keep gut all "crashers."
Anyone who has a regular bid and
who has not as yet obtained his
program should get it before 5
o'clock at the A.S.S.U. office, and
all those who bought one of the
special bids will obtain their pro
grams at the door.
