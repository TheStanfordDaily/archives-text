Pittsburg High plays Rabbit Brad
.shaw's quintet tonight at 7:30
o'clock.
Because Bradshaw's players are
expecting no competition at all from
Pittsburg High, as traditionally
weak as Palo Alto is strong, the
transbay invaders may furnish a
surprise. But even overeonfidence
will have some trouble in balancing
a worse-than-average high-school
team with Stanford's rapidly im
proving team.
