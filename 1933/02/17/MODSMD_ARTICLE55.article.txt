# Morrison Tells Dames About Australian Life
## 
### 
"Australia" was the subject of the
talk of Dr. J. Stanley Morrison at
the meeting of the Stanford Dames
yesterday afternoon. He emphasized
the primitive types of animals and
men found in Australia. They have
no clothes and no houses and no
cooking utensils, he said. Their re
ligion is very crude and includes
cannibalism.
Music for the program was fur
nished by Claude Schull, who sang
two solos, as well as joining with
his wife for a duet, "The End of a
Perfect Day." Mrs. L. Baker was the .
accompanist.
