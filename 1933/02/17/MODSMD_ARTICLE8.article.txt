# Roosevelt Gunman Bares Scheme To Slay Hoover
## 
### 
MIAMI, Fla., Feb. 16 Con
certed action to bring to justice
Giuseppe Zangara, curly-haired as
sassin, was pressed by the State of
Florida tonight while Mayor Anton
Cermak of Chicago, one of five vic
tims of bulets intended for Presi
dent-elect Roosevelt, sent word to
friends that "I'm going to pull
through for Chicago."
At Cermak's hospital bed his seri
ous condition was described as un
changed. Zangara, grilled at the
Dade county jail, said he had de
cided to kill President Hoover, but
hearing that Roosevelt was coming
to Miami, decided to make the Pres
ident-elect his target instead.
F.R. Tells Story
Roosevelt, speeding northward to
New York by train, related graphic
details of the attempted assassina
tion before massed thousands in
Bay Front Park last night.
The assassin was charged with an
attempt to murder the next Presi
dent of the United States in an in
formation drawn up by Charles A.
Morehead, county solicitor. Three
other similar charges were drawn
against the gunman, each charge
carrying a maximum penalty of
twenty years in State prison.
Cermak Condition Favorable
The bullets intended for Mr. Roose
velt missed their mark and danger
ously wounded Mayor Cermak and
Mrs. Joe H, Gill of Miami, who were
standing nearby in a tremendous
crowd which had greeted Mr. Roose
velt in Bay Front Park after he
landed from a fishing trip in nearby
waters.
Of Cermak a physicians' bulletin
added:
"No unfavorable conditions have
arisen up to the present time."
Murder Charges Loom
No charges for the time being
were placed against the assassin in
connection with the wounding of
Mayor Cermak and Mrs. Gill. Au
thorities were waiting the outcome
of their wounds, indicating that if
they proved fatal the gunman would
face charges of murder.
Hurried to Jail
The assassin, Zangara, was seized
and hustled off to the Dade County
Jail immediately after his attempt,
but not until he was almost stripped
of clothing by infuriated by
standers.
"I meant to kill Roosevelt and I
am sorry I didn't," he said. "I would
kill all Presidents and all officers."
