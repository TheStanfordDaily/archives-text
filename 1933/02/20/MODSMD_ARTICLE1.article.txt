# CARD BATSMEN WIN 9-5, EVEN BRONCO SERIES
## Stark Holds Santa Clara Under Control After Shaky Opening MEET MORAGANS NEXT Stanford Collects 8 Hits Off McCoy, Burks 
### Frank Tremaine 
Taking an early lead that was
never headed, Stanford's baseball
team whipped Santa Clara 9 to 5
in the Bronco's pasture Saturday
and evened the series at one game
apiece.
Harry Stark went the entire l'oute
on the mound for the Indians and
after a rather shaky start, limited
the Santa Clarans to one hit and
one run after the fourth inning".
McCoy was the Bronco's starting
choice but after he had been hit for
five safeties and seven runs in the
first three innings, he was relieved
by Burke, who blanked the Cards
until the ninth.
Threaten Score
After threatening to tally in the
first only to leave two men on the
bases when A1 Dowd made a bril
liant catch of Trautman's drive into
deep left field, Stanford came to bat
in the second for their big inning.
Irsfeld opened by drawing a walk.
Miles doubled and Massey walked.
Maggiora's double drove in two
runs and after Delmas had gone out,
Mallatratt singled to drive in an
other pair of scores.
Comcback
The Broncs came back in their
half to score twice on two hits and
repeated the performance in the
third after the Cards had crossed
the plate three more times in their
half. Cunningham's home run with
a man on base accounted for the
two Santa Clara counters while their
last run was scored by Gosling's
long four-base drive in the sixth.
That completed the scoring until
the ninth frame when the Indians
made victory certain by gathering in
two more runs on three hits. While
Stanford played a much better game
than on their previous appearance
against Santa Clara, they showed
there is still plenty of room for im
provement in base-running and in
the outfield.
