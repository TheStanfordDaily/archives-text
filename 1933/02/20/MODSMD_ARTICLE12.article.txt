# Dutton Delivers Sermon On Drift Of Romanticism
## 
### 
"The Drift of Romanticism" was
the topic for the sermon of the
Reverend C. S. S. Dutton, D.D., of
the First Unitarian Church in San
Francisco when he preached in the
Memorial Church yesterday morn
ing.
He contrasted naturalism and ro
manticism, showing that the natural
man is not enough upon whom to
build our civilization though that
is what we have been trying to do.
The spiritual man who is a son of
God has a sureness of touch, a mas
tery of life, and is a spring of hu
man truth, he said.
