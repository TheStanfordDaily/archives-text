# Watson Studio To Remain Open Two More Days
## After Tuesday, Must Trek To Berkeley Studio 
### 
Faced with the possibility of going
to press with the senior section lit
tle better than half-filled, and with
other departments incomplete, edi
tors of the 1933 Quad announced to
day that the Watson campus studio
will be held open two more days.
"Photo representation of the sen
ior class is far below what it ought
to be," Ray Hanson, editor, declared.
"Eating clubs and some fraternities
are short, and the whole outlook is
pretty depressing."
Proofs Now Ready
The studio, at 520 Salvatierra, will
be open today and tomorrow from
9 to 12 and from 1 to 4:30 o'clock.
Later photos will require a trek to
the Watson main office in Berkeley.
Proofs of hundreds of pictures al
ready taken are ready at the studio
here, and await selection for print
ing. Sludents who do not come in
and make a choice, Hanson said, will
not appear in the book.
