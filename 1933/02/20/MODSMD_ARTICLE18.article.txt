# Albanian Exile Discourses On Little-Known Land
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
An exile from Albania, his adopt-
I ed land, C. Telford Erickson visited
I the campus Friday to deliver a lec
ture and attend a banquet given in
I his honor by the faculty. Head of
the Albanian-American ocnooi of
| Agriculture, Erickson is passing the
i time of hit; temporary political exile
j in making a lecture tour of his na
tive country.
Dryly remarking that he is accus
| tomed to having those who intro
duce him associate Albania with
Ataska or China, Erickson prevented
the Daily from making any such
mistake. He commenccd: "Albania,
opposite the 'heel' of Italy, is a most
strategic position on the Mediter
ranean. It is the key to the Adriatic
\ and the Balkans, and so of great in
terest to all European powers."
When he went to live there Erick
son thought he was to live among

fierce peoples who carried knives in j
their mouths and ate babies for !
breakfast. Since, he has been im- i
pressed with their kindness and loy
alty. He spent 12 years in the coun
try with a large price on .his head,
yet not once was he betrayed by this I
simple people.
"Furthermore, I have seen the so- j
called ferocious Mohammedans i
walking .softly through the grass I
with bells on their slippers to warn j
the insects from harm."
On his first visit to Albania 25 \
years ago, Dr. Erickson found a j
group of people still in the feudal i
age. There were no roads or schools,
agricultural methods were primitive, '
and Mohammedan influence con
trolled the life of the women. It ha?;
been only a generation since the i
I
country emerged from live centuries ;
of domination of the Turkish sul
tans.
