# B.A.C. MAY ADD BUNN TO FROSH GRIDIRON STAFF
## Thornhill To Recommend Positions At March Board Meeting 
### 
Jimmy Bradshaw, head freshman
coach
John Bunn, assistant freshman
coach
Don Robesky, freshman line coach
Murray Cuddeback, head Gray :
coach
That setup, which will complete
the coaching staff of "Tiny" Thorn
hill, newly recommended chief of'
Stanford's football destinies, was
learned over the week-end, as the
proposal Thornhill will make to the j
Board of Athletic Control at its nexl
session, March 10.
Budget Barrier
But one catch remains—whether |
the B.A.C. budget will permit the j
employment of all the men. The.-;
source which revealed the informa- j
lion said that it appeared likely that
all of the men would be recom- j
mended.
Bradshaw was frosh coach in the !
fall of 1930 and 1931, but was ele- J
vated to a position in charge of the .
varsity backfield last year. He will
replace "Chuck" Winterburn, who j
has been named assistant to Glenn j
Scobey Warner at Temple Univer- ;
sity, Philadelphia.
Former Scout
Bunn and Robesky held their jobs,
last fall, with the former also doing '
a large amount of work scouting for
Warner. It is not known if Bunn will
continue as chief scout under j
Thornhill.
Cuddeback, who has been with
the Grays for several years, will
probably have an assistant who will I
be chosen from the ranks of the
graduating football members.
