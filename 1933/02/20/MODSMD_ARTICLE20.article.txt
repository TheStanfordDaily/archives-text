# Advisers Help F.R. Plot British War Debt Parley
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 19 (TP)â€”Presi
dent-elect Roosevelt laid the basis
for a "new deal" on world economics
and war debts in a round of con
ferences today with his economic
advisers on the eve of tomorrow's
meeting with Sir Ronald Lindsay,
the British ambassador.
All in all, there were signs of new
and imminent action in the compli
cated world economic situation.
Whether Mr. Roosevelt has any ink
ling of a new British offer coming
over here with Sir Ronald or wheth
er he is ready to propose a new
program is problematical. It is re
garded as certain, however, that his
position is unchanged that the Brit
ish and other European debtors
must give delinile assurances for
currency stabilization and tariff
reciprocity in exchange for war
debts relief.
