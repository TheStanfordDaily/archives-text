# Roughs Receive Hours; Sponsor Offered Dipping
## 
### 
When three members of the
Stanford rough contingent tip
over in Lagunita via the canoe
route, the event is just a com
mon occurrence around the
Farm water hole. But when
two frosh "accidentally" tip over
a canoe with an Encina sponsor
in it, then that's news. Such an
event smacks of a determined
motive behind the upsettingâ€”
perhaps revenge.
At any rate, in the calm of
yesterday's balmy weather, two
prominent freshmen from En
cina took out one of the spon
sors for an airing in a canoe
on Lagunita. For sonic reason
the canoe became unmanage
able and "accidentally tipped
over." The two frosh swam
ashore and left the sponsor
holding onto the upset canoe.
These fast-floating rumors
around Encina connect the "ac
cidental'' canoe upset with a
work sentence meted out to the
two frosh by the sponsor about
two weeks ago, putting a mo
tive of revenge on the "acci
dent."
