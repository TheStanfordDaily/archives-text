## Two Wins, 40-38, 41-36, Over Week-End Break Lower Place Tie FRIDAY'S GAME FLASHY Stanford To Close Season In Berkeley Saturday 
### 
No longer cellar champion of the
| Pacific Coast Conference southern
division, the Stanford basketball
' team arrives home today after scor
i ing its first double victory of the
conference season Friday and Sat
urday nights in the South. Univer
j sity of California at Los Angeles was
the victim, by scores of 40 to 38 and
i 41 to 35.
Reversing the usual procedure of
\ losing out in the closing minutes
j after holding an earlier lead, the
• Indians put the hooks in the Bruins
j by stacking up commanding mar
j gins that the Uclans were unable to
; overcome.
Friday night's contest was the
I better of the two. The Cards got oiV
' to a great start when Bill Schnetka
| let go with some more of his spec
| tc:cular shooting and tanked four
| long ones in the first five minutes,
j At the half, Stanford led, 23 to 20.
Piper Battles
Captain Don Piper and Slim Gib
| son battled back on the Uclans' be
half, but the handwriting was on
the wall.
Piper took scoring honors for the
I evening, with 19, being followed by
I Keith Topping, Stanford's brilliant
J center, who accounted for 12. Cap-
I tain Tom Cordry and Bill Schnetka
' each scored eight for Stanford, while
j Gibson put seven points on the
j U.C.L.A. record.
New Five Works
Coach Caddy Works tried a new
combination for the Saturday night
game, and it worked sufficiently
■ well to put Ucla in an 18 to 17 lead
at Ihe half. Bill Johns, an up-and
coming forward, came through with
four field goals in as many attempts
! to give the Bruins a wide margin in
the early part of the second period,
i Stanford, led by Topping and Cor
dry, with John Hancock in an as
jsistant role, polished off the Bruins
i with a beautiful closing spurt.
Topping made 15 points to leari
the scorers. Johns made .12 for the
I losers, while the rival captains —
j Piper of Ucla and Cordry of Stan
ford—each scored 10. Hancock drop
j ped six points.
Season Ends
Stanford closes Ihe season next
< Saturday night at Berkeley when it
j engages University of California in
I the third and final contest of the
I annual series. The Bears split two
{games with University of Southern
California over Ihe last week-end,
j but that one defeat definitely count
i ed Coach Nibs Price's Bear five out
| of the conference running.
Southern California, by virtue of
winning the southern division hon
i ors, will tangle with the northern
division winner within a couple of
(weeks for the championship of the
P.C.C. Oregon Si ate is the likely
opponent for Coach Sam Barry's
| five.
