# A
						New Editor Complies With Tradition, In Four Paragraphs
## 
### 
Well, Slew:
Certain that I express I lie sentiments of the staff and the
opinion of a majority of Daily readers, I sav, "Well done."
>ou have finished your career in campus journalism and
have entered a well-deserved retirement with praises of
your readers and your staff still ringing in your ears.
As for your Daii.y it was a pleasure to work on, and
;i pleasure to read, everyone fells me. No other editor in
the recollection of the present undergraduate generation
has seen so many of his editorial crusades end in success,
so many of his personal policies attain adoption bv the
A.S.S.t'. Kxecutivc Committee.
Having inherited the editorial whip from you, Slew, I
I eel tree to publicly reveal the secrets of your success in
wielding it. Consciousness of your editorial duties and op
portunities was not limited to front page "blasting," not
confined to the pale green walls of your oflicc. You carried
your battles to your adversaries, often explaining your
points and expressing your demands privately, with a
journalistic idealism which frequently denied you the
thrills of front page sensationalism.
I've had my chance to learn the fine points of editing a
campus newspaper under you, Slew, and I hope, for the
sake of your satisfied public, that I've learned lliem well.
You're right, old fella, I have a lot of crusading ideas, hut
I shall lake your advice and express none of them which
do not have some chance of effecting a change, be if even
so intangible as a change in general attitude.
0.K., Stew, I'm off. Fhitz
