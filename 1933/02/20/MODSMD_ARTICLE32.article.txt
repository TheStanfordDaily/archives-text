# Another Depression Dance, With Some Real Reasons For Attending
## 
### 
The second student relief dance of the quarter set for
tomorrow night in the Pavilion is worthy of attention, and
incidentally attendance, from a number of viewpoints.
First of all it is, of course, a money-raising affair for
the benefit of needy students. And needy students are by no
means scarce on the campus this quarter. However, this
charity angle, important as it is, is not the only drawing
card for tomorrow's hop. Twenty-live cents is the price
tor what promises to be a better than average dance.' And
two bits should not be hard to raise even in these days.
An orchestra which will be a combination of two of the
best known jazz organizations on the campus is scheduled
to provide music and intermission specialties. Few campus
dances, even three dollar affairs, can boast of a band like
the Lowry-Moller-ileche combine.
To re-stale the facts: here is a chance to give a hand to
the financially unfortunate, a chance to put in three hours
of dancing to the strains of a good band for one thin quar
ter, and a shot at some good Florida oranges. And a chance
to sleep-in Wednesday morning, too. It's Washington's
b'llhdav.
