# BULL SESSION
## SAVING THE GRADS 
### 
Saving people from one thing or
another is a great pastime. It satis
fies our self-righteousness in that
we feel we are "doing good." What
ii more potent, it satisfies our van
ity because v/e always save people
from something we dislike. For we
reason automatically that what we
dislike is of course an evil—from
which the other fellow must be
saved.
With this principle, rescuing
other people has been carried on.
We have put clothes on naked sav
ages—for their own good, of course.
We have put the Ten Command
ments in the hands of the "poor
Heathen Chinese" and Gideon Bibles
in all hotel rooms. So also, we have
taken beer from "the masses" and
havo attempted to force a system oi'
English democracy on Nicaragua.
We have carried the "white-man's
burden" with noble • resignation and
imperialistic profit. But the saving
has now shifted from the Kenya
wilderness and the Gobi dunes to
the Stanford Farm. Lurking in evil
smelling laboratories and beneath
musty encyclopedias is the local so
cial heathen—the graduate. When
eyesight and general stamina begin
to weaken, these scholars slink from
their nooks and crannies on the
Quad to their nooks and crannies in
Palo Alto. They never wet their feet
in the sea of Stanford life.
Personally, I think that is just
what graduates want to do. They are ,

satisfied to watch the tepid and not
so-tepid pleasures of the under
graduate swirl go swirling by. It
seems that others do not agree with
me. It is claimed that graduates
would like to get into the swim—gel
acquainted with something besides
their laboratory assistant and the
black and white guinea pigs.
Thus it is that the graduate wo
men are putting on a graduate
jolly-up this evening at the Women's
Clubhouse between 7 and 8 p.m. of
t course. The results may be amusing
but the plan is noble and. above all
things, bold. It probably never has
been done in the history of the Uni
versity. An unpleasant thought +o
self-sufficient freshmen in Encina is
that there are literally hundreds of
j graduate students 'all over this
1 Campus. Many of them are women.
More are men. ft is hoped that this
jolly-up will pry them loose from
their studies for an hour of socia
bility.
All work and no play may make
the grad a dull boy—but it makes
him very well informed. I think that
the average grad would rather be
dull and informed than less dull and
less informed. He would probably
rather be Ace-high in his depart
ment than King at Roble or a
Queener on sorority row.
That many grads are abnormal
creatures is well known. Whether
they desire to be saved from their
abnormality will be decided tonight.
