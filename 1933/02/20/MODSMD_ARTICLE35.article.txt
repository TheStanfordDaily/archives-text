OTHELLO—(UFA)—Presented by
English Club in Assembly Hall.
When silent pictures met their
drastic end four years ago, and talk
ing pictures replaced them, a new
art or (if there are those who object j
to movies as an art) technique was,
introduced. To compare an old pic
ture with one of our modern ve
hicles is therefore not at all like
comparing, let us say, an old auto
mobile with a 1933 model. A new
automobile represents the latest de
velopment in a steady progress of
improvement; a new picture repre
sents only the latest development
since talking pictures began. The old
technique ended with the last silent
picture.
This' German version of "Othello,"
which an assembly hall audience
saw last Thursday night was cer
tainly not a splendid example of the
silent art, but then there are cer
tain situations and stories which
lend themselves to silence, and
Shakespeare's "Othello" is not one
of these. It might very well have
been made with talking picture fa
cilities, but in silence, it presented
difficulties.
Character planting, accomplished
in the play by dialogue, was done
with introductory titles, not subtle,
to be sui'o, but a quick way of saving
much footage. It is very possible
that these introductions were trans
lators' inceptions, for the rest of the
picture indicated no desire, on the
part of the director, to make this
saving in footage. The movement was
slow, but perhaps justified because
of the tragic theme.
The audience was given an over
dose of facial expressions, some
tmes known as "mugging." Evident
ly, the technique of Buchowet/.ki,
the Russian director, led him to
avoid profiles, for his principles
looked at. each other out of the cor
ners of their eyes, and. in all close
ups, had the pupils of their eyes
violently thrust sideward, which was
quite annoying.
Emil Jannings, because of his
rather ample figure, lacked some of
the virility of Othello, but gave a
splendid portrayal. Werner Krauss,
the devil-like lago, was a fiendish

j villain, but, due to a bit of clowning !
on his part, took away from the role j
that feeling of complete mastery of \
the situation which it enjoys in '
Shakespeare's play.
The Charlie Chaplin comedy i
which opened (he program proved j
once more that comedies should
have remained silent, that they
should depend on pantomime and j
situation for humor, rather than on i
dialogue, as do our modern attempts j
at comedy.
Old and poorly cut as it was, "The j
Immigrant," Chaplin's piece, pro- !
voked more laughter in the small ■
assembled crowd than a majority of .
) contemporary short subjects do with !
larger audiences. A combination of i
slapstick and subtle comedy sugges- j
tion makes Chaplin's work decidedly j
; superior. His delightful mannerisms, |
genteel in a sordid background, lend j
an individuality which no one else j
has been able to rival. —Rapf j
