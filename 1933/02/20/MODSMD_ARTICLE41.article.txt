## Editors And Ex-Editors 
### 
Back in the dead, distant days of
late 1931, when Editor Dick Friend
lich was storming and swearing
around the Daily office and when
Stew Crawford and Fritz Goodwin
were two very green and very
frightened night editors, a trembling
group of Olympia-seeking men and
women tried out for the editorial
staff of the Stanford Daily.
Among the apple-polishing
and therefore hopeful select who
were accepted as reporters were
a couple of kids who aspired to
some day edit the sports page of
the Daily. Both had the conceit
of courage and each was deter
mined to lie sports editor of
Volume 82.
The best man won, and "Baseball
Bob Wade became the prophet of
this column, the potency of this
page. From October 1932 until last
Friday Bob was the king of Daily
sports and also sometimes the inno
cent sport of irate campus kings.
And the loser in those particular
appointments, who is the present
writer, decided that he didn't want
to be sports editor anyway and low
ered his ambition to the meagre
editor-in-chielship.
