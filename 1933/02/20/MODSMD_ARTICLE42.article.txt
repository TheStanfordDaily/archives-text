# DAILY OFFICE NOW RESEMBLES MONASTERY
## 
### 
Since that faraway day three
paragraphs and a little over a year
ago, Friendlich has left and the
Daily office has become a monastery
of sober, quiet work. Crawford has
left, thanking an agnostic's God for
the Hoovers and serene in the
realization that this jnan Goodwin
i.s now in charge. Jernegan and
Lloyd and Kennedy—three of the
best have left; and Goodwin him
self is left to squeeze into or squirm
around in the editor's chair—and to
wonder why in hell he wanted the
job.
Yes, and promotions and de
motions were made during that
period. Among the most bizarre
of a strange group of surprises
was the appointment of myself
to the sports editorship. That ap
pointment necessitated a return
to my early lofty desire to write
Slants and to boss a hunch of
reporters who couldn't talk back.
And it also necessitated the per
manent hibernation of my lowly,
rationalized ambition for the
editorship.
