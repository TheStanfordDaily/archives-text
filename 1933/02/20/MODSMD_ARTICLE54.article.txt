# Frosh Septet Ekes Out Win
## 
### 
In a ragged, sloppy exhibition,
Stanford's freshman water polo teum
defeated a Sequoia Alumni septet
by a 3 to 2 score last Friday in
Encina pool. Throughout the battle
the yearlings booted numerous
chances to tally, and luck was main
ly responsible for their victory.
Had it not been for the great per
formance of freshman Ken Living
ston at goal guard, the babes might

have emerged on the short end of
the .score. Woodard also played well
on defense.
On offense the first-year men were
weak. Viney, with two goals, led
what little attack there was, while
Captain Myers contributed one.
In view of the fact tTiat the frosh
meet the California babes this week
in their final'and biggest game of
the year, Friday's showing was not
any too cheering. However, Coach
Thornton hopes that before he and
his boys trek to Berkeley Wednes
day, some of the more obvious
weaknesses, will be ironed out.
