# FROSH NINE COMES FROM BEHIND TO EDGE OUT PALY HIGH, 9 TO 8
## 
### 
Coming from behind to tally two
markers in the last half of the fifth
inning, Stanford's yearling nine
eked out a 9 to 8 win over the San
Francisco Poly High team Saturday
morning on the lrosh diamond. It
was a loosely played contest and
was called at the end of the fifth
after having gone nearly two hours.
Putting up their worst exhibition
to date, the babes were extremely
fortunate to win. Six errors, corn

mitted mostly by the "million dol
lar infield" didn't help the cause
any, while a decided weakness with
the willow almost cost them the en
gagement.
lli Takes Lead
Poly High was off to an early
lead, scoring five runs on two hits
and several Stanford boots in the
first inning. Stanford was able to
tally but once in this canto, but
went into a temporary lead in the
second, crossing the plate six times,
mostly on walks and errors.
The invaders tied it up in the
third and took the lead again in
the fifth.
At this point an otherwise peace
able ball game was nearly turned
into a "brawl" game. It seems that
one of the city boys was rather
peeved at the way things were being
handled and so decided to take out
his spite on some of the opposition.
Fight Averted
However, he barked up the wrong
free when he singled out the year
ling's star center fielder and had it
not been for the prompt actions of
Coaches Wolter and Cuddeback the
impromptu "boxing exhibition"
might have turned out very disas
trously for the Bay City lad.
As it was, the game proceeded
more or less serenely with Cudde
back's boys finally winning out.
Stanford's batting was at low ebb
Saturday with Tremaine, Clark, and
Marshall garnering the only bingles.
All of these were one-base blows.
Franchesci looked to be the best
of the pitchers, hurling nice ball in
his three innings on the mound.
