Native Sumatran sailors, angered because their pay was cut, overpowered nine officers of the Dutch
cruiser De Zeven Provincian, seized the ship at Harbor Olelen in Sumatra and put out to sea. Five
days later a concentration of Dutch naval and air forces bore down on the fleeing quarry and it was
bombed. Eighteen of the men were killed and 25 hurt before they surrendered. (Associated Press Photo)
