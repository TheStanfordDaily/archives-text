# 'Rough' Show Contributions Due March 18
## 
### 
Only four weeks remain for en
terprising campus authors to formu
late their contributions for the Stan
ford Theatre Fund Burlesque con
test. Entries, which can be in skele
ton form—one complete act, a syn
opsis of the whole, and a list of the
type and number of songs requisite,
are due on or before Saturday,
March 18, of pre-final week.
At present approximately twenty
contributions are expected to come
from the pens of registered students,
which class alone are eligible for
the contest. Several students are
now working in pairs, which is al
lowable under contest rules, al
though no work will be accepted if
more than two writers have col
laborated.
Script Restrictions
Additional restrictions on scripts
are: two acts, two settings, adapta
bility to the Stanford stage, some
semblance of continuity.
The Theatre Fund Committee,
which is sponsoring the all-male
show, desires to remind any who are
considering writing scripts that com
posing ability will not be needed.
At the close of the contest, March
18, three selections will be made.
These will be perfected in detail by
April 24, on which date final selec
tion will be madd between the three
former choices. It is in this interim
that campus composers will go to
work.
Music Requirement
Music may either be student
written, or pieces from any source
not subject to royalties. Script-au
thors do not have to write their own
music.
Several members of the commit
tee of judges appointed three weeks
ago by Stan Beaubaire, head of the
Theatre Fund Committee, are con
templating withdrawal from the
category of judge in order to be
able to submit entries of their own.
