# BLANSHARD TALKS TO LOCAL MEETING ON RACKETEERING
## 
### 
Speaking to an audience which
packed every available inch of the
Palo Alto Community House on Fri
day night, Paul Blanshard, New
York liberal political writer, ad
dressed the Town Meeting on the
topic, ''Racketeering â€” High and
Low, a Social Interpretation."
Blanshard pointed out that rack
eteering has permeated and debased
the American spirit. Speaking from
the Socialist standpoint, he stressed
the need for a new evaluation of
ideals in which Ihe profit motive
will be eliminated and society will
not be organized on a basis other
than for private profit.
Local Communists heckled Blan
shard throughout the speech. Pro
fessor Marx of Stanford, presiding
over the meeting, managed to pre
serve order.
The light from a star will be used
to turn on the electricity at the Chi
cago World's Fair.
