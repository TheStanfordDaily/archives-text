## Chinese Ignore Ultimatum; To Quit Gateway 
### 
CHINCHOW, Manchuria, Feb. 19
(/P) â€”The most convincing indica
tions were seen today that this week
v/ill witness the beginning of the
long-heralded Japanese and Man
chukuoan assault on the Chinese
province of Jehol and the opening
of the most extensive international
conflict the Orient has seen singe the
Russo-Japanese war of 1905.
A Japanese ultimatum ordering
Chinese forces immediately to evac
uate Kailu, northern gateway of
Jehol province, was received yester
day at Peiping. It was said at Chi
nese Manchurian headquarters that
it would be disregarded, even
though the Japanese threatened to
attack at once. The Japanese were
reported prepared to issue two sim
ilar demands to other Chinese of
ficials.
The Japanese war machine, bris
tling with the newest destructive
weapons, was pointed menacingly
westward. Japanese leaders ex
pressed confidence that five days
after the advance was begun the
rising sun banners would- be within
the shadow of the main objective,
Jehol City, the ancient summer
capital of Imperial China.
Japanese columns, with less sturdy
Manchukuoan troops sandwiched
between, were expected to enter
Jehol according to a thoroughly co
ordinated schedule.
