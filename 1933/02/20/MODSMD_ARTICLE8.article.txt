# Bill Swain Narrowly Averts Bad Air Crash
## 
### 
An accident was narrowly averted
yesterday afternoon at the Palo Alto
Airport when Pilot Bill Swain took
off in his red and white monoplane
and failed to clear the trees in the
vicinity of the Stadium. The plane
is powered hy a small engine which
was insufficient to lift it clear of
the trees, forcing Swain to turn
around at almost stalling speed and
return to the airpoi't. For a moment
the wingtip seemed to brush the
treetops but the plane landed safely
and took off after a longer run.
