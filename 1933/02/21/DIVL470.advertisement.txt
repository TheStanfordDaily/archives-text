Month-old Dresses
for a
Month-end Clearance
As we explained last month', it is the
policy of the New Gotham Shop to show
the newest style merchandise at all
times. We buy only one or two gar
ments of a kind and mark them to sell
quickly. At the end of each' month',
then, we take all garments that are left
and mark tKem down to clear them im
mediately. That is why we call these
Dresses "Month-old"—they are new and
right in style now—yet offered to you
at real reductions.
