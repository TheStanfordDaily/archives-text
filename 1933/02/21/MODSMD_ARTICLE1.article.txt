# STANFORD NINE HOPES FOR WIN IN GAEL GAME
## First Conference Tilt To Be Held Tomorrow On Local Field-2:30 LINEUP NOT DECIDED Bronco Games Not Counted In League Race 
### Frank Tremaine 
Ready to chalk up their first con
ference victory, Stanford's ball
players will meet St. Mary's Gaels
at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
on the Sunken Diamond.
Due to the fact that Santa Clara
i.s unable to travel South this year
to play U.S.C., because of a cur
tailed expense account, the game
the Cards won from the Broncs last
Saturday v/ill not count in the
league standings.
Stark oÂ» Mound?
Coach Harry Wo. \er is still unde
cided as to his selection for a starter
on the mound tomorrow afternoon.
He was favorably impressed with
Harry Stark's work in the Santa
Clara game Saturday and may give
the big hurler another chance to
start, although Heringer is a strong
possibility, and Savinske, Estes, or
Campbell may get a chance.
Either Jim Massey or Captain
"Ike" Livermore will be behind the
bat. Massey has looked good in all
his games to date but Livermore is
rapidly rounding into shape again.
Infield Unchanged
The infield will probably remain
the same as in previous games with
Gordy Mallatratt on first, Jim Wool
ley at second, Jerry Trautman at the
far corner, and Bert Delmas at
short. Woolley, a sophomore batting
in the clean-up position, looks like
a fine hitter and should drive in a
lot of runs this year.
Fred Maggiora will be in center
field and top the batting order with
Dick Miles in the right garden. Any
one of four men may start in left
with or Nutting getting the
call against a southpaw chucker and
Neuman or Buller opening if a
right-hander starts on the mound
for the Moragans.
Veteran Battery
St. Mary's can start a veteran bat
tery against the Indians tomoi row
with Flynn in the box and Bareilles
catching. McKay is another pitching
possibility while Bonnelli will prob
ably see action behind the bat.
The Indians looked very much
improved in their second game
against Santa Clara and should give
St. Mary's plenty of action tomor
row. With improvement in base
running and handling balls in the
outfield, Stanford should develop
into a pennant contender.
