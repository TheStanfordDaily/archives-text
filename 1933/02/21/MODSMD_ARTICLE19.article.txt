# Law Research Aide Hits Preferential Voting Bill
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
Preferential voting, accepted by
the student body last week, which
is designed to do away with revotes
such as today's, may not prove to
be entirely reliable itself. A depend
able campus legal authority, John
Hurlbut, research assistant in the
School of Law, finds four major
flaws in its application to A.S.S.U.
offices.
When second and third choices are
used in electing an officer a new
factor enters the campaign. In cities
in which the preferential system is
used, aspirants to office are often
found campaigning under the slo
gan:
"Even though you aren't for me,
jot me down for second place." In
(his* way a candidate may be elected
who is by no means the popular
choice.
Hurlbut further criticizes the
a m en d m en t on mathematical
grounds. If five or six popular stu

dents are running for an office there i
is a strong probability, when ballots j
list only three choices, that none I
will receive an actual majority, i
however the votes are shuffled.
As the amendment stands with
out supplementary legislation or
adequate explanation, it is doubtful I
il the Supreme Court could discover I
its meaning," Hurlbut, student of |
constitutional law, said.
My final criticism is the wide !
leeway allowed the election com- ]
mitteo in counting the ballots. The
complicated manner of handling the j
votes provides an excellent shield !
for the maneuvers of a prejudiced
election board,' he concluded.
The preferential system is being |
used successfully in 50 municipal!- j
ties throughout the country, among;;
which are Toledo, Jersey City, and :
Denver. It was invented by the poli- 1
ticians of Grand Junction, Colorado, i
in 1909. h
