# Card Ruggers, Pasadena Reds Tangle Friday
## Game To Be Played Here For Charity Fund 
### 
Stanford sport fans who have
been caught up in the enthusiasm
for rugby will be able to see p. real
exhibition of the ancient and honor
able sport when the Pasadena Reds
meet the Stanford Rugby Club here
in the Stadium Friday.
This is the Stanford team's first
game at home since they recently
walloped the San Francisco Bar
barians and incidentally added $400
to the Student Relief Fund. Friday's
game is also sponsored by the Relief
Committee.
As a special attraction, Almon E.
Roth, Stanford comptroller and for
mer rugby star, will kick off to start
the game.
Ernie Caddel, Bill Sim, Chuck
White, Tex Walker, Johnnie Reis
ner, Buck Van Dollen, Ben Pala
mountain, and Bobby Grayson have
been cutting some fancy capers in
the way of open-field running in re
cent practice sessions and should
give fans a thrill or two if they get
loose Friday.
The southern California contin
gent will arrive late Thursday with
a team of 18 men. Following the
Stanford game they will continue to
San Francisco to meet the Olympic
Club squad.
Friday's game will be the last for
Stanford before they meet the Gold
en Bear team here March 4 in the
"Big Game" of the local rugby
series.
