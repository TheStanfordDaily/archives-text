A "v" that looked like a "g"
almost gave Stanford's touring
debaters, Ronald Kay and
Wayne Bannister, a unanimous
decision over the University of
Nevada Slaturday night. After

nounced as being unanimously
in their favor.

of the judges dashed frantically
up to the platform to assure the
chairman that at least one vote
had been cast in favor of the
Reno institution. It seems that
while two of the judges had
written the abbreviation '"neg."
on their slip, the third had
written "Nov.," which stood for
Nevada and not negative, as
the chairman seemed to think.
