# Palo Alto's Comedy Of Errors—Act the First

### 
Al least one good story lias conic oul of I lie current im Ii -
speed campaign in I'alo Alio. II seems thai a local resident
considered by police ;is an invcteralc law-breaker knows
more aI >« 1111 city speed laws than Judge Springer and his
entire force of income collectors.
The story goes that let's call him Smith already a
several-lime ofl'ender, was legally proceeding through town
in the direction of a less thickly settled region. Not far
behind him there amhled a member of the local motor
cycle force just on the chance. I lis chance was not long
in coming. In a short lime our Mr. Smith stretched out
into a lf>-mi lc-an-liour clip.
The cop, of course, stopped him and started to write
onl a ticket. Smith; however, insisted upon an immediate
personal audience with Judge Springer, with which desire
the representative of law and order was glad to comply.
The judge, not al ajl sorry to see Smith again, was told the
"how" and the "go" of the situation.
Judge Springer had visions of a good slid' fine hut Smith
had other ideas good ideas as it happened. It seems that
the judge had not quite so complete a knowledge of the
contents of the local statute* hooks as he might. One section
al least had escaped his notice until the advent of our Mr.
Smith.
There is no limit on the speed of a vehicle, so the sec
lion states, past a city block on which there are not more
than two or three houses. II appears that the block picked
by our hero filled nicely within these qualifications. Smith
went home, content in mind and pocket.
The moral of this yarn, if moral there must he, is "Go
thou and do likewise."
