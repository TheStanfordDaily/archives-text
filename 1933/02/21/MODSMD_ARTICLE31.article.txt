# Chase On the Hook— A.S.S.U. Officers Angle for Lecture
## 
### 
The latest trump up the sleeve of the A.S.S.U. dealers is
Stuart Chase, noted economist, writer, and lecture!*. Pres
—rut plans are to secure the popular public figure for an a 11-
t'niversily assembly lecture at some date in the near fu
ture. The assembly plan has been approved bv all neces
sary committees, directors, and others. About all that re
mains to be done is the actual closing of an agreement with
the lecturer himself.
Whether or not that agreement is consummated, the
idea, originating with the A.S.S.I . officers, is praiseworthy.
A lecture by Stuart Chase, close as he is with the existing
economic situation, should be of extreme interest to all
campus residents, including students.
There's one catch to the plan which the A.S.S.U. officers
probably haven't thought of vet. Stuart Chase may have
heard of the fate recently suffered by a fellow lecturer, Will
huranl, al a neighboring campus. No doubt the Stanford
assembly-producers will be able to convince Chase that the
recent and disgraceful "birding" of Durant by a Berkeley
assembly is no indication of what a leelurer may expect on
the Farm.
