The startling fact, it seems to us,
in the Miami fusillade is not that
Roosevelt was missed, or that Cer
mak will live—but rather that Zan
gara is not a communist. It was al
together fitting and proper that
Zangara is not a communist. It was
altogether fitting and proper that
Zangara should be a communist. In
every manifestation of unrest, we
are led to believe that the Reds are
(he prime-movers. The energy of
this handful is phenomenal—if what
we read in the papers is true:
From the Capital to California—
from Detroit to the Gulf, the "reds"
are in the thick of everything. It
would have been great anti-red
blurb to have the Roosevelt plot
hatched in Stalin's mustache and
executed directly by a Moscow
agent—or at least a vicious socialist.
But no, the crime is bungled by it
most inoffensive, harmless-looking
creature who happens to be a Regis
tered Republican.
But the Republicans are trying to
hush it up. But v/e are against hush
ing. Every party must bear its black
sheep. In fact we arc beginning to
feel that the thing was plotted by
the G.O.P.—and is barely indicative
of what is yet coming. The great
Gray Elephant is on the rampage.
The gray uprising is beginning to
rise. It is all very clear now. De
feated but never beaten, the grays
are on the march. Mothers to your
children! Husbands to your wives!
Danger. Terror. Beware, the grays.
The Gray Menace—not as colorful
as the "Red Terror"; but more omi
nous, once you think about it. The

THE GRAY UPRISING

first thing to do is to show that
several bank robbers are Repub
licans. That shouldn't be hard. And
that will definitely fix the slur of
crime on the Gray Menace. Once
branded as criminals, it would be
highly advantageous to place the
dead-cat of foreign subsidization 011
the G O.P. lap.
According to the papers, Russia is
faking care of the local reds. Of
course, it wouldn't do at all to have
the Soviets finance the Grays as
well. That is unfortunate because
anything that can be labeled "Rus
sia" is sure to be a popular , menace.
Russia, being barred, France prob
ably is the next best bet. After all,
it was a Republican administration
that gave the moratorium. Yes, it's
settled. The Gray Menace is being
financed by France. Why? There
doesn't have to be a reason. They
just are.
In fact, their not having a reason
for this vile work just goes to
show how vile they really, are. To
make the Menace a very finished
menace, it is still necessary to raid
the White House and grab of! a
scrap of paper on which Hoover had
written the word, "death." With
this, and an interpretation of Lin
coln's statement, that this country
cannot exist half slave and half free,
to mean that all Democrats have to
be assassinated—the picture is com
plete.
We have heard of the "Yellow
Peril"—and the "Red Terror." Enter
Bogey Man No. 3: "The Gray Men
ace"—screams, weird music, curtain.

course, it wouldn't do at all to have
the Soviets finance the Grays as

anything that can be labeled "Rus

Russia, being barred, France prob
ably is the next best bet. After all,
it was a Republican administration
that gave the moratorium. Yes, it's
settled. The Gray Menace is being
financed by France. Why? There
doesn't have to be a reason. They
just are.
In fact, their not having a reason
for this vile work just goes to
show how vile they really, are. To
make the Menace a very finished
menace, it is still necessary to raid
the White House and grab of! a
scrap of paper on which Hoover had
written the word, "death." With
this, and an interpretation of Lin
coln's statement, that this country
cannot exist half slave and half free,

The startling fact, it seems to us,
in the Miami fusillade is not that
Roosevelt was missed, or that Cer
mak will live—but rather that Zan
gara is not a communist. It was al
together fitting and proper that
Zangara is not a communist. It was
altogether fitting and proper that
Zangara should be a communist. In
every manifestation of unrest, we
are led to believe that the Reds are

this handful is phenomenal—if what
we read in the papers is true:
From the Capital to California—
from Detroit to the Gulf, the "reds"
are in the thick of everything. It
would have been great anti-red
blurb to have the Roosevelt plot
hatched in Stalin's mustache and
executed directly by a Moscow
agent—or at least a vicious socialist.
But no, the crime is bungled by it
most inoffensive, harmless-looking
creature who happens to be a Regis
tered Republican.
But the Republicans are trying to
hush it up. But v/e are against hush
ing. Every party must bear its black
sheep. In fact we arc beginning to
feel that the thing was plotted by
the G.O.P.—and is barely indicative
of what is yet coming. The great
Gray Elephant is on the rampage.
The gray uprising is beginning to

first thing to do is to show that
several bank robbers are Repub
