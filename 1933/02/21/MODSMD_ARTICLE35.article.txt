WATERCOLORS BY VICTOR AR
NAUTOFF — At Kccble's, Palo
Alto.
The many different styles in this
young artist's work show how heav
ily he has drawn upon more mature
influences. From Orozco comes his
conception of Mexican street r cenes,
while the San Francisco Bay sketch
es owe almost everything they have
to Rousseau—with, perhaps, an in
sult charge added. And there are
two very bad head studies in imita
tion of Lurcat.
When Mr. ArnautofT finds his own
style, he may do some pleasing
work. In his present experimental
stage, however, too much of his sub
ject matter is insufficiently realized
and confusedly built up. In some in
stances he discards form entirely
and depends for his effect upon
heavy coloring, while in others he
draws accurately and then forgets
about color. The nearest approach
the artist makes to a medium be
tween these extremes is in the Sur
realist depictions of Mexico, which
present mass constructions with
gratifying simplicity. Here also there
is something much nearer to crea
tive surety and co-ordination.

STATE FAIR (Fox)—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
The transference of Phil Strong's
novel to the screen has been suc
cessful, despite the fact that the film
is not as realistic as the book. The
plot remains the same, except for
the Gaynor-Ay res love interest,
which was changed to conform to
cinema custom. The change, how
ever, it adroit and not at all objec
tionable. The feeling of rural antici
pation and enjoyment of simple
things which was so strong in the

book, is retained to a remarkable
extent. It is surprising that the sub
stitution of such common and ap
parently colorless events for the
usual flashy and melodramatic
movie situations should keep one
interested in the film. For the skill
ful suspense and the sustaining of
keen interest, I credit the sincerity
and vividness of the acting and di
lecting.
It must be admitted that the pic
ture is uneven, that there are some
spots almost painfully bad. The
scene of young Frake's seduction is
none too skillfully handled. The in
frequent stiltedness of the dialogue
is obtrusive because of the natural
ness elsewhere. But the memory of
the good qualities quite outweighs

the memory of the bad.
