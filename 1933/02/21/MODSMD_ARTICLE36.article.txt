KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA crashed
through in a big way with a real
honest-to-goodness seance down ,at
666 Hawthorne in Paly Sunday
night.
AFTER GUARANTEEING to their
guests that plenty of the superna
tural would be in evidence, the
Mi.sses Sandy Leib and Lucy Guild
were rather surprised to find an
undertaker ringing the doorbell late
in the evening in response to an
order to call for a "body" . . . Who
was more griped . . . the man with
the headstones or the Sisters? . . .
Two telegrams followed from the
Beta house in Berkeley and other
parts unknown . . . asking "WHAT'S
DOING WITH THE KAPPA'S TO
NIGHT?'' . . . or something to that
effect . . . Next a taxi driver . . .
of the P.A. Super-Service type .. .
rushed his Austin dutifully up the
front steps in answer to a "rush
call" . . . Those sitting in were con
stantly interrupted with anonymous
phone calls all evening accompanied
with horrible ghostly groans, etc. . ..
ALTHOUGH the Kappa's didn't
have enough quiet to contact their
Angels of the recent Past, they si ill
intend to get some action this week
. . . Watch for it . . .
There are nearly 20,000 suicides
in the United States every year,
with males predominating.
