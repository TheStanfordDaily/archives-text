"WASHINGTON—Senator Robert 1
Reynolds, Democrat of North Caro- |
lina—a newcomer to legislative j
halls—is out for a record in his i
first six-year term. The record, Rey- ,
nolds told newspaper men, would
be not to introduce a single bill.
'• 'I think there are too many laws
and bills now,' he said- 'I think it
would lie a good tiling for me to
serve six years and not introduce I
one.' " —S.F. Chronicle.
