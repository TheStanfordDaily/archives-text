About the Fund,
Athletes, and Cash

Although no one has asked my
advice, I would be glad to co-oper
ate with Les Hables, head economist
of the Student Relief Fund, in the
jaising of money for empty-pock
eted Stanford men and women by a
means that would be painless for
everyone concerned.
f( is my plan to charge Stan
ford's headline-hunting athletes
;» set amount for printing their
names in the Daily, and the
feasibility of this idea is based
on the supposition that much
would whole-heartedly be spent
for this purpose. There is a law
of economics stating that the
willingness with which some
thing is purchased varies as does
(be demand for it. and under
these circumstances my plan
would insure a steady and sub
stantial stream of money to the
worthy Fund.
The idea of course demands elab
oration, as the amount to be charged
should vary as does the news value
of the athlete's performance, in
jury, or week-end escapade. Per
haps it would be fair to .set 50 cents
a column inch as the regulation rate,
and then to make subtractions from
and additions to that price in ac- !
cord with the fame of the customer !
and the brilliance of his accomplish- '
merit.
CHAMPIONS TO RECEIVE
WO ALLOWANCE
Under these circumstances, a
ehampion half-miler or an all-Con- :
lerence shortstop would only be j
charged some 20 cents an inch as
their names have a selling value foe j
which deductions .should be allowed, j
Ordinary halfbacks and captains of !
fencing and swimming teams would :
eome in the 50-cent category, while j
a really fine middleweight should
be allowed at least 10 cents (.11 the I
regular rate.
Because of the predominance
of Chi Psis on the team and be
cause there is little front p? /
interest in the sport, soccer > ,y
-crs would lie charged !'• .m <>5
to 80 cents, dependiw on the
number of goals scorcd. Golfers, i
unless champions, would have j
to pay a Hat rate of 75 cents, and
all junior managers would be
charged a dollar an inch irre
spective of their sport.
The merits of this plan do not j
slop with the raising of money for j
the Fund. If carefully worked out, |
this scheme would lead to a definite j
increase in the athletic prowess of I
Stanford, for the incentive of a i
cheaper price per inch in the Daily j
would cause world s records to top- j
pie regularly and (if special con- j
sideration in the form of a free \
sentence for each touchdown scored !
were arranged) might even create a i
football victory over Southern Cali- I
fornia.
DAILY BUSINESS MANAGER
ALSO CONSIDERED
I should be frank and suggest at j
this time that such a scheme, al- I
though beneficial to both the ath- i
letes and the down-at-the-heels I
.students, would never receive the
consent of the Daily's business man
ager without a struggle. Therefore,
in order not to create any hard feel
ing and to assist the Daily as well
as tin students, 1 do not believe that i
Mr. Hablcs would object to possibly
a 90 or 95 per cent cut for the !
Daily's business department.
This entire scheme, whose ■
ramifications I will admit arc
already bewildering me, can
come to fruition only so long as
the athlete's demand for news
paper space remains at its pres
ent high level. Ordinary non- |
supporting students should
therefore constitute themselves
an extra-legal - Back-Slapping
Society to go around compli- j
inditing athletes on getting their
names in the Daily. —D.S.
