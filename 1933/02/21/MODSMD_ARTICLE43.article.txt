# Yearlings Play Mission Today
## 
### 
Having emerged with a none-too
impressive victory over San Fran
cisco Poly High's nine last Saturday,
Stanford's freshman basebali team
battles another nine from the Bay
City at 3:15 o'clock this afternoon
on the yearling diamond. Mission
High School affords the opposition
this time and the Babes will have
to show better form than they did
last week if they are to win today.
Numerous misplays and lack of
hitting power caused the freshmen
to look very pathetic Saturday and
they will attempt to demonstrate
this afternoon why they were rated
at the beginning of the season as a 1
powerhouse yearling nine.
The southpaw lob ball artist.
Franchesci, will probably hold down
the mound for the Stanford boys
with Oct. Morgan behind the plate.
Blanchard should also do hurling
duty as he has been dividing the
assignments with "Chesci" recently.
In the infield Grayson, Galbraith,
Clark, and Tremaine will see ac
tion. This combination looked a bit
sour at times in the Poly contest !
and will be facing the acid test to- 1
day.
Hard-hitting Bones Hamilton,
Monk Moscrip, Pope, Marshall, and
Macroth may all get into the con
test as outfielders, but the first
named trio heads the list.
