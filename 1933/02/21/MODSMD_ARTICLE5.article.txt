# ELLENOR COOK SINGS TONIGHT
## Cossacks, Maidens Will Be Interpreted In Song 
### 
Interpreting peasant types
| widely varied as the dashing Cossack
} and the wistful maiden, Miss Elle
i nor Cook will present a recital of
I "Folk Songs from Picturesque
; Lands" in the Assembly Hall at 7:30
o'clock tonight.
Both Miss Cook and her accom
i panist, Miss Maryann Shelley, will
j wear the colorful costumes of the
J countries from which her groups of
songs have come. These costumes
are not authentic reproductions, but
j dresses which Miss Cook procured
] from the peasants who taught her
I the songs she will present tonight.
Each song will be prefaced by a
! short explanation in English, but
I their rendition will be in the native
! tongue.
Although Miss Cook's early musi
j cal ambtiion was to be a concert
; pianist, she changed her mind after
S a chance meeting with a Czech wo
| man on Ellis Island. At. that meet
ing she was enchanted with the folk
| melodies she heard. A trip abroad
followed during which she joined
with the peasants in their festivals
i and games and learned their folk
! music. She returned again several
times during the next few years and
her study resulted in a concert tour
j abroad and a number of tours in
j America.
For her faithful portrayal of their
! folk songs, the Polish and Rouman
-1 ian governments have decorated this
American-born artist.
