# Journalists To Consider Plans For News Club
## 
### 
With the purpose of setting up a
journalism club at Stanford, a meet
ing is being called of all journalism
majors, members of the Daily staff,
and any other students interested in
such a project, to meet at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon at the home
of Everett W. Smith, professor of
journalism, at 556 Alvarado Row.
This will be in the nature of pre
liminary meeting to the coming of
Lincoln Steffens to Stanford to
speak to the journalism group the
evening of March 2. Results from a
questionnaire distributed to journal
ism students indicate that there is a
desire for such a club to be formed
with meetings to be held either once
or twice a month.
Those interested in attending the
meeting this afternoon should notify
Mrs. Marjorie Bryant in the publi
cation office. It is desired that stu
dents come prepared to discuss
questions connected with the pro
posed club and with ideas as defi
nitely formed as to its purpose and
nature.
