# Intramural Tennis Enters Second Round Competition
## 
### 
With the first round completed,
intramural tennis swings into sec
ond-round matches this week. All
the teams conceded a good chance
for the title came through the first
round encounters either by vic
tories or defaults.
Coach Elwyn Bugge urges that
the second-round matches be com
pleted by the end of this week, so
that winners of the quarter's play
can be named before finals week.
A metropolitan newspaper each
day carries as many words as a
full-sized novel.
