# KIRKWOOD PLANS CONFAB FOR NEW LAW STUDENTS
## 
### 
So that prospective law students may better understand the new alter
native plan of law school study which will be inaugurated next fall quar
ter, a discussion meeting; will be held Tuesday night, March 7.
Dean .Marion Kirkwood of the School of Law will speak before the
group, composed of prospective law students in all four classes. lie will

$ discuss the new plan and its rela
tion to each class.
Following this, Harry J. Rathbun,
Professor of Law, will conduct a
discussion group among the Lower
Division students regarding their
plans or pre-legal curriculum. The
meeting will be held in Room 214 on
the English Corner at 7 o'clock.
Kirkwood pointed out that the to
, tal combined time of academic and
law work will remain unchanged at
seven years. Students, however, will
be faced with the alternative of tak
ing three years of academic study
and four years of legal work, or, as
at present, four years of undergrad
uate academic work and three years
of law study.
Law More Intricate
According to Kirkwood, modern
law has become so intricate that
three years' study is not as com
plete as it should be, so this new
alternative course is offered so that
the student may obtain four years
of legal training, utilizing one un
dergraduate year, if he so desires.
