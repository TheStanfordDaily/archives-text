pects, Professor T. A. Bailey of the
Department of History .stated last
night that cabinet selections had
been based more on ability and less
on purely political factors than most
appointments in United States poli

Five interesting features of the
present choices were pointed out by
Professor Bailey: (1) "The selection
has been the most secretive of re
cent years—a-week from the inau
guration, a complete selection has
not been announced. (2) There will
be no defeated aspirants for office
in the Cabinet. (3) In his choices,
Franklin D. Roosevelt has succeeded
in pleasing both conservative and
progressive groups of his pai'ty. (4)
Republican insurgents will also be
represented (referring to Senator
Cutting of New Mexico). (5; For
the first time in history a woman
will appear in the cabinet."
Indicating the manifold political
difficulties of getting a suitable
group of officers to serve in a cabi
