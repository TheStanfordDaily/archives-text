## Singer Wears Gay Costumes Of Slavic Peasants 
### 
"Singing is more than recreation
to the Balkan peasants, it is an ex
pression of their daily lives," ex
plained Miss Ellenor Cook to her
audience in the Assembly Hall
Tuesday evening, and the simple
Slavic folks songs she sang made her
statement plausible.
The melodies Miss Cook brought
to her large audience were origin
nally sung by the cowherd, in the
peasant kitchen, in the market
place. Closest to the heart of the
audience and the song which brought
the largest applause was about a
country girl who was asked to at
tend a dance by three different men
—"(he shoemaker asked me, but he
smelled of leather. The professor
asked me, but he was so dull. The
gardener asked me and oh, but he
smelled of violets."
Miss Cook's interpretation of
Slavic ballads was enhanced by sim
ple? and sincere dramatizations, by
explicit explanations, and most of
all by the colorful costumes worn by
her and Miss Maryann Shelley, her
accompanist. For the Czechoslova
kia)! group of songs, the artist wore
a costume once part of a peasant
girl's trousseau.
