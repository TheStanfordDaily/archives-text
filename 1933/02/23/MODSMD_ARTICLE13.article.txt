# GUERARD SPEAKER ON GENIUS STUDY
## 
### 
Summarizing a series of lectures
concerning genius recently given in |
one of hi.s classes, Professor Albert
Gueiard of the English department
will speak before members of the
University Philological Association
at 4:1 ;> o'clock this afternoon in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Guerard's paper is en
titled "Seven Conceptions of Gen
ius.''
Speaking of his paper, Professor i
Guerard said that innumerable defi- j
nit ions of genius have been given, |
but to simplify the discussion, the j
field has been narrowed down to j
seven, a group widely divergent. At i
present, he said, he is not ready to I
adopt any single definition and de- â– 
clare it to be the final analysis.
The purpose of the paper is to i
start a discussion and elicit further
contributions toward obtaining a j
definition.
