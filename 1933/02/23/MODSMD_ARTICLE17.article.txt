### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 (/Pi â€”
Senator Borah today wrote M. C.
Migel, silk manufacturer of Provi
dence, R.1., that if Congress confers
"dictatorial" power upon President
elect Roosevelt, he would hope and
expect Roosevelt "to fling it back in
the chattering teeth of a pusillani
mous Congress with the reminder
that he was the President of the
United States and not its dictator."
Migel had written the Idaho Re
publican, suggesting that he get up
courage enough to say to the Senate
that an emergency exists and pro
pose giving the President "dicta
torial powers within the constitu
tion for a certain period."
