# STANFORD NINE DOWNS MORAGA BY 19-0 SCORE
## Cards Win First Game Of State Intercollegiate Conference Series DELMAS INDIAN STAR Return Game With Gaels Slated Next Week 
### Bob Wade 
Driving out eighteen safe hits oIT
the deliveries of five St, Mary's
pitchers, and combining them with
twelve bobbles by the visitors, Stan
ford's varsity baseball nine took the
first game of the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Conference pennant
race 19-0 on the Sunken Diamond
yesterday afternoon.
Big Fred Heringer, sophomore
pitcher, went the route for Wolter'.-.
men and allowed the Gaels eight
scattered bingles. Three times the
Moragans were caught with two
men on base when the inning end'-d,
largely due to some fancy fielding
by the veterans Delmas and Traut
man at shortstop and third base.
Heringer issued no free passes and
fanned seven of the thirty-live men
who faced him.
Delmas put on a real show both
in ihe field and at bat, where lie led
the Card hitters with five for five,
including a double in the sixth. Next
in line was Fred Marriora, who
rapped out a brace of singles, and
a home run in the fatal seventh
which saw the Indians pile up five;
runs. Miles, Livermore, and Herin
ger collected two singles apiece, and
Trautman batted out a single and a
triple.
St. Mary's was handicapped
throughout the contest not only by
an obvious lack of practice, but by
the fact that Caviglia, their first -
string pitcher, and Mohra, their
regular shortstop, have just finished
basketball and arc not yet in shape
to play.
These two men are expected to
bolster the Gael's lineup consider
ably, and since they have always
been tough on their own field the
return engagement at Moraga next.
Wednesday will in all probability bo
much more like the close game
that the Saints staged with Stanford
last spring.

Driving out eighteen safe hits oIT
the deliveries of five St, Mary's
pitchers, and combining them with
twelve bobbles by the visitors, Stan
ford's varsity baseball nine took the
first game of the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Conference pennant
race 19-0 on the Sunken Diamond
yesterday afternoon.
Big Fred Heringer, sophomore
pitcher, went the route for Wolter'.-.
men and allowed the Gaels eight
scattered bingles. Three times the
Moragans were caught with two
men on base when the inning end'-d,
largely due to some fancy fielding
by the veterans Delmas and Traut
man at shortstop and third base.
Heringer issued no free passes and
fanned seven of the thirty-live men
who faced him.
Delmas put on a real show both
in ihe field and at bat, where lie led
the Card hitters with five for five,
including a double in the sixth. Next
in line was Fred Marriora, who
rapped out a brace of singles, and
a home run in the fatal seventh
which saw the Indians pile up five;
runs. Miles, Livermore, and Herin
ger collected two singles apiece, and
Trautman batted out a single and a
triple.
St. Mary's was handicapped
throughout the contest not only by
an obvious lack of practice, but by
the fact that Caviglia, their first -
string pitcher, and Mohra, their
regular shortstop, have just finished
basketball and arc not yet in shape
to play.
These two men are expected to
bolster the Gael's lineup consider
ably, and since they have always
been tough on their own field the
return engagement at Moraga next.
Wednesday will in all probability bo
much more like the close game
that the Saints staged with Stanford
last spring.
